T HE University Council! American Federation of Teachers' 
Union has filed an unfair labor 
practice charge on behalf of 
visiting lecturers at UCSD agaInst 
the administration for its 
interpretation of an employment 
contract which both parties 
signed last June, the Union' 
local president said. 

The Union contends that the 
administration at San Diego has 
violated article 25 section A. 1 
and A.2 of the Memorandum of 
Understanding for the non-senate 
instructional unit (MOU), which 
~ates, "The instructional 
workload standard for 
faculty/ instructors in the unit for 
an academic year shall not 
ex eed nine workload courses 
over three quarters. 

The violation occurred when 
the Dean of Humanities, Dr. 
Stanley Chodorow offered 
employment to Deborah Small. 
James Degan, and John Herschel-
Dobies. all visiting lecturers in 
wrIting, to a 12 course workload 
for three quarters, three more 
than the maximum specified in 
the contract. 

"The purpose of the contract 
wa to eliminate the ridiculous 
Sorts of ourseload assignments 
that had existed in the past in 
excess of nine cour es per year." 
Gary Adest, the UCSD 
representative of the colle tive 
bargaming team saId. "Nobody 
an do a quality job teachmg 

that many courses. The contract 

steHe that workload" can never 
be higher than nine courses per 
year." 

Dr. Chodorow said the 
Administration has not violated 
the contract because the writing 
courses are equivalent to 0.75 of 
a regular in tructional course . 
"We need to put out a list of 
equivalencies. Some courses take 
more work than others. We haVl! 
to take into a COunt the size of 
the cla , the repetitiveness of 
the class and outSIde 
preparation , in order to avoid

lABOR 

disparities among the 
departments ," Chodorow said. 

The Union believes the 
administration is misapplying 
the use of equivalen ies. "They 
do not belong in the area of 
courses, they belong in the area 
of labs and sections. The whole 
system wa negotiated to provide 
flexibility. The administration i 
trying to petrify the whole 
system," Fred Lonidler, Union 
president said . . 

It is also the view of the 
Union that the administration . 

violated the ontr..lct when It

department 's newly employed 
visiting lecturer Drs. Mary Lou 
Locke , Ru sell Hvolbeck and 
uzanne CahIll. In the past, ix 

course per year were the 
standard workload for the history 
department. 

Many of the vi iting Ie turers 
felt they were treated unfairly. "I 
wa offered the po ition with the 
understanding that I would 
re eive 100 percent pay for

I was told by Chodorow that 
nine ourse workloads 
represented full pay and that I 
would be working SIX cour e at

Faculty members 
win awards 

An 0 eanographer and a 
'll,uhcmatlcian at UC D have 
h.:en named winners of 

Pn: ~lden!l:l1 Young Investigator 
A",uds for 19 7 by the ational 
- len e Foundation . 

The award s, whi ch can be up 
to 100,000 per year for a five-
year penod, were given to Lynne 
D Talley, a researcher at Scripps 
Ins titution of Oceanography and 
Ruth J. Williams, an aSSIstant 
pltlfessor of mathematics. They 
were among 200 of the most 
promIsing young SC ientists and 
engineers around the counrry 
who were chosen for the awards. 

The Young Investigators 
Awards are used to lund 

re~earehe rs ncar the beginning of 
their at'eers and to help 
uni versities attract and retain 
outstand ing young Ph.D.'s who 
might otherwi e pursue non-
teaching careers, according to 
the NSF. 

Williams, who holds a Ph .D. 
in mathematics from Stanford 
and has been a faculty member 
at UCSD sin e 1983, said the 
funding would help her hire 
more graduate students and 
allow her to invite fa u1ty with 
si milar research interests from 
other institut IOns to vi sit UCSD. 

Talley is an assistant professor 
and assistant research 
ceanographer In the Ocean 

Research Division of UCSD's

he is interested in the general 
IrculJ IIOn of the ocean and the

Transfer policy 
revised 

At its ovember meeting, the 
UC Academic Council approved 
a policy whi h deals with the 
issue of undergraduates who 
transfer from one UC campus to 
another. 

The policy speci fies that 
transfer studcnts who have 
ompleted the Breadth (or 

General Education ) requIrements 
of one UC campus will be 
regarded as having completed 
such requirements for any 
campus in the system. Campus-
specific upper dIviSIOn breadth 
requIrements would , however, 
not be affectcd under the 
proposed policy; transfer 
students would still be expected 
to complete the upper-divi sion 
requirements of the campus to 
which the y'd transfer. 

Furth~rmore . students who 
transfer before completing the 
Breadth requirements of their 
original campus would be 
expected to complete the 
requirements of the "receIving" 
campus. 

The Council has sent the 
proposed policy, along with an 
accompanying letter by Council 
Chair ell Smelser. to divisional 
senates for comment , and has 
asked for responses by February 
1. Should divisional reaction be 
favorable , the CounCil probably 
will seek to have the poltcy put 
Into place by the mechanism of 
legi slation submitted to the 
Uni ve rsl lywlde Senate Assembly 

The pnnclple of reCiproci ty 
has gathered support from many 
groups Inside the University a~d 
some outside it. Such a poltcy IS 
regarded as being an important 
step in smoothing the transfer 
pro ess among all segments of 
hIgher education in California . 
Though the proposed poltcy 
applies only to transfers within

Officials decide to 
shut down reactor 

UC offiCials decided to shur 
down a 20-year-old nu lear 
reactor on the Berkeley campus, 
c: ltlng the "political hasslIng" it 
has aused outweighed its 
usefulness. 

AccordIng to UCB Vice 
Chancellor Roderick Park, the 
primary reason for closing down 
the reactor was that its use for 
research was diminishing and 
that the Universtty could usc the 
space it occupies for other uses. 

Park said the secondary 
reason was to "get rid of aU the 
political hassling that goes along 
with It." 

The shutdown requires 
approval by rhe Federal uclear 
RegulatOry Commission.

AS discusses 
'State of Campus' 

By MARK SANDERSON. AssI,,-ialc CW> edllOr 

A proposed <;1 billion ut in stu~e.nt grants from the .Federal government and the pOSSlblllry of establlshmg an inte rcollegiate football team at UCSD were tWO tOpICS 
discussed Tuesday during the latest in a se ries of " tate of the 
Campus" addresses sponsored by the Associated Stud ents (A.S.). 

Jill Marchick, Executive Lobby Annex DIrector, to!d the 
noontime crowd of about 100 that PreSident Ronald Reagan s latest 
budger plan, recently delivered to Congress, includes a substantial 
decrease in revenues allocated to student Pel Grants. 

"Cutting off grants sends students to the bank," Marchick said. 
·When they can't payoff the loans I.t hurts the economy." ~he U.c. 
Student Association (UCSA). MarchlCk saId , IS 10bbYlngagamst thiS 
proposal. . . 

Marchick also noted there will be a 9.1 percent Increase In 
student fees , effective in faU of 19t17. The UCSA, of which Marchick 
is a member, headed off a proposed increase for the Spring quarter, 
and has delayed any fee increases since 1983, she said . 

The issues involved in establishing an intercollegiate football 
program at UCSD were discussed by AS. President John Riley. 
"Football can only enhance student life .. . Currently the only large 
social events are TG's and Fndays in the Pub ," Rile y said . 

Riley is a strong advocate of a football team, but he wants students 
to be aware of the economic implications and the realities of such a 
sports program. "This will be a divisio~ III team '.' .no TV,stadiums, 
sc holarships or heavy recruiting. We Will be playmg Pomona-Pitzer, 
Occidental ... not UCLA," Riley said . 

Initially it will take $250,000 to sta rt. the program. These funds are 
not currently aV'ailable, according to Riley. A per student reglstrauon 
fee increase of $6.50 each quaner will be necessary in order to 
establish football on the campus. 

Riley believes students will see a referendum on the ballot during 
the spring elections addressing a fee increase speCIfically t.O raise 
funds for a football team. Should the refere ndum pass, it is possible 
UCSD will field a club team next fall , and an intercollegiate football 
team in fall of 1988. 

Riley also reviewed the progress the AS. has rrtade during the ~rst 
quarter and a half of his term In office. He noted se veral upcoming 
events and projects, including the Tipsy TaXI semce whtch WIll 
begin later this quarter. ILJ

Unfair labor practice 
Continued from page 1 
Intenti on of the UCSD 
administration to impose an 
in flexible nine course standard 
on aU departments, despite clear 
language in Article 25, Section 
A.I that 'Instructional workloads 
may be lower (than nine), based 
upon the instructional workload 
standard of the department, 
progr<lm or board .'" 

The wording of Article 25, A.I 
has created a controversy 
between the administration and 
departmental chairs as to who 
has the right to establish a 
depanment's workload standard . 
"I think they (the administration) 
are in violation of the contract," 
Michael Parrish , the history 
departmental chainman, said. 
"We (the department) think we 
are the best judges of what the 
standard (workload) should be 
for our departments. 

"(Article 25) is a clear 
statement that says workload 
should be based on the 
standards of the department. The 
department setS the standard 
workload. Throughout the history 
of the bargaining, the University 
was in absolute agreement with 
us that it was the department or 
its equivalent that would set its 
own courseload," Adest said . 
"The bottom line is that, in the 
past, the (UCSD) administration 
has had a certain power base to 
determine lecturer workload; 
now, however, it is being 
threatened with losing that 
power base in a fonmal sense 
because there is a written, legal 
document that says the power 

resides not with them, but with 
the department ." 

The administration interprets 
th e contmct differently. 'We read 
the MOU as stating quite clearly 
what we take to be the 
traditional arrangement, that the 
University is responsible for 
se tting the workload . If you ask 
who is the University, which is 
the crucial question , it has 
traditionally been the 
Administration of the University, 
the preSident and , by delegation , 
the Chanq:l\or and Vice 
Chancellors of the various 
campuses," Chodorow said. 

"We also read the text of the 
MOU as not saying that the 
department se tS their own 
workloads, but rather that when 
the UniverSity sets the regular 
workloads, it should take into 
consideration the depanment's 
standards. That does not mean 
that it has to agree with the 
members of the department that 
workloads should be one thing 
or another," Chodorow said . 
Since the contract covers non-
senate lecturers who have no 
researeh responsibilities, and 
non-tenured or associate 
professors, Chodorow has 
questioned the departmental 
chairs' concern in this issue . 
"What puzzles me is why the 
(senate) faculty wants to treat 
lecturers better than they treat 
themselves. " 

One of the main reasons the 
Departmental chairs are upset 
about (he increased workloads is 
that it will make it more difficult 
to recruit quality faculty. "With a

nine course workload , we can't

attrall good teache rs. We're 
pricing ourselves out of the 
market. (Also ) to ask someone to 
teach more than two courses a 
quaner would dilute the quality 
of the teachmg. We are 
concerned with the quality of 
education ," Parrish said . 

Lonidier sa id he thinks the 
reaso n Ihe administration is so 

adament in determining 
workloads IS finanCIal. "-r heir 
concern IS money and our 
concern is quality of education ," 
he said . 

Chodorow Joes not agree with 
PalTish or Lonitlier. "In rny view, 
(the quality of education issue) is 
ovemlled. I don't believe It. Ni ne 
courses is not extnlordinary," he 
said

nIe an unlalr labor practice 
charge , it had to exhaust two 
grievance heanngs on campus. 
The firs l hearing was attended 
by Dublin , Lock, Chodorow and 
Michael Melman, the hearing 
officer from Labor Relations. 

Melman responded to the 
grievances and ruled against th e 
Union. In the appeal hearing. 
Melman agai n heard the 
grievances and did nOt overrule 
himsel f Melman refused to 
comment on the speci fics of the 
case. 

The Union's last option was to 
file an unfair labor practice 
charge. The case is pending 
before the public employee 
relation board. The re are 
currently ten visiti ng lecturers 
who have filed grievances. 

Chodorow said that Alticle 25 
cannot be argued . "The Union 
has pla yed this game of going 
through the grievance procedure. 
The contract is pretty clear as to 
what is grieveable (sic) and what 
is nOt , and course loads are not." 

Although the contract is 
system-Wide, no other UC 
campus has this contractual 
problem of workload 
determinations. "I think the 
other UC Admin istrations are 
waiting to see if San Diego gets 
away with this interpretation ," 
Lonidier said . 

"I think that you're goi ng to

the Administrative oITices who constan tly place economl matlers 
over the quali ty of educallon . 

It wa the Dean of Humanities, Dr. tanlcy Chowdorow, who 
of ered employm~m to three VISiting lectu rers 10 writing 0 long as 
they would dgree to teach twelve courses In th ree quarters. In a 
rather despicable attempt to defend his dm 'o nia n employment 
ethiCS, Dr. Chowdorow declJred that the Instruction of a wri ting 
course requires onl}, three-quaners the effort of a "normal" course, 
We would assume that Dr Chowdoruw's logiC would surprise mos t 
of the writing professors In the UC system, as would hiS 
IOtcrpretation of Article XXV in the Collective Bargai ning 
Agreement. The UC/ AFTU points out thutArticle XXV clearl y states 
that the workload should be based on the standa rds of the speCific 
department as it has throughout the histOry of the University . 
Chowdorow and the Admlnistnltion , howe\er, have twisted the 
[radltlonal Imcrpretallon 111 hopes that It will a ppear as If the 
"University" IS responsible for setling the workload , The pathetic 
irony of this interpretation is, sadly, what Dr. Chowdorow term:. as 
the "crucial question ," namely: What IS the true meaning o f the 
word "un iversity?" Dr. Chowdorow has hosen to na rrowly define 
"university" to mean the Administra tion and little clse. Fo r us 
14,000 peons rem alnlOg, th is is a quite astound ing revelation. 

As participants in the University p rocess, we have found that 
those who instruc t us arc equally importa nt, if not mo re so , th an the 
UC Regents, the ir reSident subord mates, and thei r colle ctive 
monetary interests. We would define a unive rSity in its most 
traditional manner, [hat being where equi table individ uals 
congregate 10 an atlempt 10 furt her thm knowledge in a 
pleasureable manner. It is diITicult, however, to imagine any 
constructive interaction between an inquisi tive student a nd a 
disgrun tled, overwo rked professor. By a llOWing Ihe Admimstralion 
to conti nue to sacrifice the quality o f educatio n 10 their petty 
fidUCiary inte rest , UCSD w ill most likely degenerate into an 
Im]Xrsonal educational asse mbly hne . ~

Part II 
U.S. and Israeli terrorism 
By RAAFAT GEORGY 

Israel' leading partner or, as I'm 
more In ' lined to say, conspirator is 
the Umted St.·ue ( the United 

t<lles IS the de-fac IO 
re presentative for the Wes tern 
world; th erefore, we may deduce, 
in a mo re abstrac t se nse , that the 
conspiracy against the Arab 
people, and mo re specifically the 
Palestinia ns, is Western-Israeli ). 
ThiS "special" relationship IS a 
dialeClical process that opts to 
keep thc Palestinians und er a 
canopy of oppress io n . 

Undoubtedly, the most 
powerful lobby in W ashington is 
the AIPAC (American Israel 
Public Affai rs Committee). AIPAC 
is the principal architect of the 
systematic "pro-Israel " policy in 
the Congress, hecutive branch 
and the Pentagon (remember 
thaI AIPAC is but one element in 
the larger picrure of Zionist 
influence in the West). From 
1948 to 1981 the United States 
has poured $42 billion (this 
IOcludes public and private aid ) 
into Israe l. For the fiscal years 
1978 to 1982, Israel received 
-+8% of all U.S. military aid and 
35% of U.S. economic a id 
worldwide . In 1983 , the Reagan 
administration requested , for 
Is rael , almost $2.5 billion out of a 
tOtal aid budget of $8 .1 billion 
( this Included <;SOO million in 
grantS and <; 1.2 billion in low-
inte rest loans), 

There is strong evidence that 
the 1982 invasion of Lebanon 
("Operation peace for Galilee") 
was backed by the United Sta tes. 
Meir Pail wrote that "All signs 
indica te that the United States 
gave reasonable political backing 
to the 10 F (Isreali Defense 
Forces) invasion of Lebanon , 
even when it became clear that it 
was delivering a heavy blow both 
on land and air to the Syrians in 

, Lebanon ." Pentagon figures 
"reveal a massive surge of 
military supplies from the United 
States to Israel in the first three 
mo mh s of I 1982J." Note that the 

invasion began on June 6, 1982, 
In 1982, mihtary aid to Israel was 
almost 50% greater Ihan in Ihe 
preceding year. It is indeed an 
unfortunate tragedy that the 
United States pours bi lli ons of 
dollars Into Israel (an illegitimate 
entity that continues to deprive 
another people their fundamental 
right of self-determination on 
their homeland - Palestine). 

The United States supplies 
Israel wilh state-of-the-art 
technology to be used 
unconditionally for the 
destruc tion of a whole people -
Palestinians. How do millions of 
defenseless Palesti nians defend 
themselves agai nst F14's , F-IS's, 
sman bombs ... etc? Would the 
label of "barbarism" apply to 
Israel if they advertised a bomb 
being dropped over defenseless 
people with the caption saying 
"Bombs you can count on to do 
what they're supposed to do, 
That's the only kind of bomb we 
make." 

Hitherto, I used the term 
"terrorism" In quOtes for a good 
many reasons. The term has no 
clear definilion ; there is no 
absolute standard by which one 
can juxtapose a particular act of 
violence to determi ne if it is 
"terrorism" or not. Each 
defi nition is a function of 
political means or ideological 

ends. The United States 
construc ts a Man ichean 
definition to depict those who 
confront her foreign policy as 
"Ierrorist." According to 
Washington, "terrorism" in any 
cause is the enemy of "freedom" 
and unless punished by 
"democ racies" who have a "moral 
right" to do so, the fou ndations 
o f "c ivilized" society will be 
undennined. Such rhetOriC, when 
analyzed cri tically, is grossly 
naive and ethnocentric; 
moreover, the underlying 
assumption behind the term 
"civilized society" is that there 
are certain socielies who are 
"uncivilized," who harbor 
"uncivilized" individuals that 
commit "terrorist" acts. Israel , on 
the other hand, is an ally of the 
United States, Iherefore , it enjoys 
linguislic immuni ty. I have also 
used the term "terrorism " in 
quotes, so that I may describe 
American-Israeli -Palestinian 
violence without using 
connotative terms. 

When Palestinia ns employ 
violent means in their struggle 
against Israel and , granted , this 
violence is al times directed 
tOwards civilian population ( the 
Palestine Liberation 
Organization , PLO, has 
repeatedly condemned Violence 
direcled towards civilians); we 
may condemn such acts morally 
and politically, but 
condemnation does not explain 
why such violence occurs or how 
we can prevem it. We need to 
a nalyze th e causal forces that 
underlie "terrorism." The socio-
anth ropological conditions in 
which the Palestinians live is a 
variable which is usually 
overlooked . The Palestinians 
have been forced off their land , 
disenfranchised, defamed and 
denied their fundamental and 
human right of se lf-
determi na tion. The Palestinians 
in Lebanon live under constant 
Israeli raids that have become

Zionists and Traitors 
Palestiman refugees, lOok place 
mside the historic area of 
Palestine . Many of Jordan's 
cabinet ministers and members 
o f parliament have come fro m 
western Palestine . The major pa rt 
o f the country's economy and 
gove rnment administration is In 
the hands of former residents of 
western Palestine. About half o f 
the twO million Jordanians on 
th e East Bank have their o rigins 
in western Pa lestlne. And 
a pproximately three-quarters of 
the inhabita nts of Amman, the 
capital , came from weste rn 
Palestine . 

with pro-Palestinian speakers

delegitimation of th e tate of

'The massac re of innocem 
Arab c iVilians by jewish troops at 
Deir Yassin demonstrate s that 
the Jews were no less terroristic 
in 1948 than the Palestine 
Liberation Organization (PLO) is 
today." 

Unlike the PLO's exclusive 
focus o n civilian targets, the 100 
troops from the Irgun and Stem 
group lh at struck at Deir Yassin 
on April 10, 1948, targeted the 
village for its mililary impOrtance. 
Deir Yassin was on Ihe road to 
Jerusalem , which the Arabs had 
blockaded, and it housed Iraqi 
troops and Palestinian irregulars . 
Snipe rs based in Deir Yassin 
were a constant threal 10 the 
Jewish c itizens in Jerusalem. 

Arab civilians were killed at 
Deir Yassin, 254 of them , but 
that attack does not COnfOnl1 to 
the propaganda pieture that the 
Arabs have tried to paint.

civilians at Deir Vas in was not 
premeditated, The attackers left 
open an eseape corridor from 
the village and more than 200 
residents lefl un harmed. After the 
remaini ng Arabs feigned 
surrender and then fired on the 
Jewish troops , some of the 
attackers killed Arab soldiers and 
Civilians indiscriminate ly, 

What also diITerentiates Oeir 
Yassin from Arab terrorist attacks 
is that it is the exception, rather 
than the rule. The only reason 
Arab sympathizers constantly 
raise Deir Yassin is that they 
have nothing else 10 raise . This 
is in contrast 10 th e nearly 
endless list of premeditated Arab 
attacks on civilians--Munic h, 
Ma'alot, I<iryat She mona, 
Nahariya, numerous bombings in 
Jerusalem and Tel 
Aviv,skyjackings, murder of 
diplomats, attacks on synagogues 
outside of Israel; the list goes on .

was Baghdad's Caliph Haroun al 
Rashid who invented the yellow 
badge of shame which jews were 
ordered [0 wear in the year 807 
A.D.-selti ng a precedent thaI 
would be followed centuries later 
in Europe. 

In 1066, more than 5,000 j ews 
were murdered by Arab mobs in 
Granada. More than 6,000 were 
massacred in Fez, Morocco in 
1033. In Libya, Ali Burzi Pasha 
murdered hundreds of jews in 
1785. Eighleen jews wcre killcd 
in Tunis in 1869. In Morocco , 
more than 500 Jews were 
murdercd be!Ween 1864 and 
1880. 

jewish populations were 
co ntinuously harassed by Islamic 
restrictions and under ever-
prese nt physical lhrear. Riors in 
which dozens were slain 
occurred in Damascus in 1048, 
in Iraq in 1941 , in Libya in 
1945, in Egypt in 1946 and 1948 
and in Yemen in 1947 and 1948, 
not to mention the horrifi c 
massacre of jews in Hebron in 
1929 before there was a jewish 
state. 

"Never." writes Memmi , 
"except perhaps for !WO or three 
eras with very clear boundaries 
in time. such as the Andalusian 
period ... have the jews lived in 
the Arab countries otherwise 
than as diminished people in an 
exposed pOSition , periodically 
overcome and massacred so that 
they would be aCUlely conscious 
of their position." 

He concludes, "If we leave out 
the crematoria and the murders 
committed in Russia from 
Kishinev to Stalin, the sum total 
of the Jewish victims of the 
Christian world is probably no 
greater than lhe total number of 
victims of successive pogroms,

Professor Ritchie digs up- the truth 
Pirating: l110re risk than romance 
By LINDA J. GlA VE 

T HE discove ry of a surprising series of old letters initiated Robe rt 
(Roy) C. Ritchie's search into the 
Ii ves of legendary characters, a 
quest whtch eve ntually drew hIm 
to Pennsylvama, Min nesota , 
England , and Holland. These 
legends roamed the seas of thc 
world , casting their fortunes 
li terally to the wi nd , and 
becoming as battered, tough , 
and eventually as broken as the 
shi ps in which they sailed 
Whatever their title , be it sea 
hawk, bu cancer, privatcer, or 
robber, these me n were mos t 
commonly known and feared by 
the name of pi rate . 

RItchie, a hiStory professor at 
UCSD, has recently bee n named 
special assistant to Chancellor 
Atkinson . In his new book, 
Captain Kldd and the War AgaillSl 
the Pirates , Ritchie reveals the 
harsher realities of the profession 
which have been covered up by 
romantic versions of pirate 
sto ries. N ong with the lifestyles 
of common pirates, Ritchie traced 

the li fe of aptai n (William) 
Kidd from the time he fi rst 
appeared in history at th e age of 
44 a a PII"J tC in the Canbbean. 

"It 's merely robbery. It 's morc 
glamorous because It occurs in the 
Ca ribbean , or the Indian Ocean, 
whde sailing tho e wonderful 
hIps. We have th is wond erful 

image of Errol Flynn and hiS good 
old lads wandering around ," 
Ri tchie said , "but the fact of the 
matter IS that (the pira tes held) J 
gun to somebod )" s head just like a 
mugger would today, and sai.t 
'stand and deli ve r.' 

The maIO areas for pi rate 
activiry were in the Caribbean , 
West Afrtca, and the Ind ian 
Ocean where Madagascar, not 
bei ng under th e cont rol of any 
particular country , came to be 
one of th e largest centers for 
pira te trade. The pirates' ac tual 
base was a small island off the 
nonheaste rn coast of Madagascar 
called ainte Marie. It was hot, 
mosquito-ridden , and hard to 
approach - th e perfect pirate 
lair. The two islands, along with

centers of the pirate trade . 

The natural winds dictated 
when mere hant ships would 
travel from Ncw York to Sainte 
Marie to trade guns, gunpowder, 
liquor, an d clothing. "It could be 
a very, very, profitable busines ," 
RI tchIe said . 

The pIrate profession flourished 
from the mid - ISOOs to the earl y 
1700s be fore it was abruptly 
crushed by the same 
gove rnments that used to 
encourage their voyages. 

In the ra e for colonizati on 
bet\veen the Dutc h, the French, 
and the Engltsh , "there were very 
few rules, international law wa s 
in its infancy, and even those 
were generally ignored because 
the stakes were extraordinarily 
high ," Ritchie stated , "high 
enough to enticc men away from 
their wives and familie s to sign 
o n with some of the most 
fea rsome men in history. It was 
the letters of these men to their 
wives that sparked Ritchie's 
digging into 300-year-old records 
to uncover the pirate's world. 

"It 's an extraordinary piece of 
entrepreneurship ," Ritchie further 
remarked , "I haven't seen any 
o th er organized trade in ea rly 
Amenca that has quite the 
ent repreneurial skill and with 
such an extreme element of 
danger. 

"In wartime, the state gave 
pirate warships commissions to 
go our and attack enemy 
commerce ," says Ritchie. "As long 
as (they) attacked the commerce, 
or even the warships of the 
enemy, (the pirates) could 
capture them, bring them home 
and h.ave them declared legal 
pnze in a prize coun. The state 
got a small percentage, but (the 
plratcs) got to keep the bulk of 
what was pirate booty to take 
back to New York. However, the

market in New York was not a 
large enough market for all the 
gold , silver, jewels, silk, rext iles, 
drugs , and spices rhe pirates 
captured. Another route \vas 
established to the European 
markets where people did not 
really care about the origm of 
their goods." 

The pirates' world was 
surprisingly democratic . Each 
man had an equal vote and 
captains could, and often were , 
voted in and out of office. 
Despite the fairness of the 
system, getting voted out of 
office was not always a pleasant 
or even voluntary event. (More 
than a few captains were made 
king of the nearest sa ndbar.) 

LIfe was rough on a ptrate 
ship. Because pIrates depended 
on superior numbers to capture a 
prize (the last thing they wanted 
to do was sink the prize ship 
with cannon fire ), they carried 90 
to ISO men in extremely 
cramped quarters. The voyages 
were long and tempers flared 
quickly. 

"They were chronically short 
of food and water, the ships 
were overerowded , and the men 
were armed and pretty cranky. 
There were incredible numbers 
of mice, cockroaches and rats; if 
they were really hungry the rat 
population would go down vety 
qUickly," Ritchie explained. 

The heat and humidiry of the 
equatorial oceans made voyages 
a place in which disease quickly 
sp read. "In fact, there were ships 
that were discovered where 
there's no one left alive on board 
because some disease had gotten 
on board and simply swept 
through it ," Ritchie said. 

In response to their "floating 
hell" existence, many of the men 
were constantly drunk. "On one 
occasion a group of pirates took 
three days to capture a ship 
because there were never enough 
sober men available." 

It was while doing research for 
his first book, The Dune's 
Province , about New York in the 
mid-1600s, that Ritchie came

Ironi cally cnough , It wa s the 
rcscarch for aptain Kidd that 
led to thc idea lo r his ncxt, 
upcoming book. Ritchie 
dcscnbes it as a book about 
forest pcoplc . 

"In doing Captain Kidd and th e 
War Ag(linst the Pirates, I became 
aware that there were a lot of 
people who lived out on the 
periphelY. They're not in 
colonies, they're in little 
-cttlements . . . thcy live a lifc 
thm's apart from empire ... These 

people really escaped from 
society. 

"I have this plan in the back 
of my head to apply to the 
National Geographic Society and 
say, 'Look, why don't you pay me 
to fly to Madagascar and take a 
look at this old pirate lair and 
see what exists?' " 

Perhaps a buried trea ure? 
"That's ridiculous." Ritc hie 

said, "The men who turned to 
piracy did so because they 
wanted money. The idea of 
burying booty on a tropical 
island would have struck them as 
insane ." ~

Triton men crushed Christian-style 
Ex-UCSD star Steve Flint and AlA win in meaningless exhibition 
By GUSTAVO SANTOYO, Sport 

T AKE one look at Athletes in Action and sometimes you wonder why the Los 
Angeles Clippers are in the NBA 
and nOt these "ministers in 
sneakers ." AlA, a team made up 
of former NBA and coll~ge 
players whose goal is to spread 
the Christian gospel, win 80 
percent of their games every 
season against primarily Divisiop 
I and International competition. 

So when AlA came thumping 
into Triton Pavillion to go up 
against this diminutive (by 
comparison) Division 1\I school, 
only with God's help could 
UCSD win. But unfollunately for 
the Tritons, God was already 
roOting for the other team. 

So AlA did the expected , 
toying with UCSD like a 97 lb. 
weakling before putting the 
Tritons away by the seore of 
118-85. 

Editor 
Gettys' college career with the 

University of Houston was one 
player's dream 01. Well , almost 
dream of. 

Phi 5/all1Pl1a jamma , the 
dunking fraternity at Houston 
that included such notable 
jammers as Olajuwon, Drexler, 
Benny Anders, and Michael 
Young went to the Final Four 
three times in five years, 
including two appearances in the 
NCAA final. 

Houston never won the 
national championship, but it 
was that bleak moment in 
Albuquerque in 1983 that will 
forever linger In the minds of 
Cougar fans . 

Houston was up by one point 
with three seconds left, in the 
game when North Carolina 
State's Derek Wittenburg took a 
thiny footer that missed the rim , 
but turned out to be a perfect 
alley-oap for Lorenzo Charles, 
who slarnma jarnma-ed Houston 
at the buzzer into second place 

oblivion . 
For Gettys, it was a gut-

wrenching loss. "Benny (Anders) 
had ju t come into the game fo r 
me, so I was on the bench 
watching," said Gettys, who at 
6'7" was the only Phi 5/amma 
who couldn't janHlla . "It was 
devastating," said Gettys "but 
because I was a Christian and 
basketball was not the most 
imponant thing in my life, I was 
able to handle it. A lOt of guys 
had problems after that . But 
without a doubt, It was the 
greatest disappointment of my 
basketball career: 

Gettys did get one dunk in his 
final year at Houston and 
subsequently got drafted by the 
Chicago Bulls. But an ankle 
injury in tryout camp ended any 
NBA aspira tions. Nichols, who 
was at that camp, asked Gettys 
to join AlA. "I'm really happy at 
this opportunity to continue 
playing basketball, but my 
immediate goals are to stay with 
AlA." sa id Gettys. 

• • • 
Although Gettys' hopes for 

NBA career may have ended with 
AlA, Steve flint 's trek to hoop 
stardom has been ongoing si nce 
his days at UCSD. 

Tuesday night game marked 
Flint's first game in T ritan 
Pa viII ion since he ended his 
coUege career at UCSD at the 
end of the 84-85 season. It was 
Flint's first game willi AlA, and 
although Aint only seared seven 
pOints, his hopes of an NBA 
career are still alive . 

"It 's always been a dream of 
mine to play in the NBA and I'm 
still worki ng towards that: said 
Flint. 

After a disappointing freshman 
year at UNL v, former UCSD 
head coach Jon Block, an NBA 
player for twelve years, was able 
to lure Aint to UCSD by 
promising to teach him 
everything he could ta get him to 
go pro. 

"\r was a so-so decision ," said 

the 24-year-old flint. "I did get a 
lot of help from Block, but it was 
hard to adjust going from a 
Division I 10 Division 1lI 
program ." 

But the former Warren College 
student enjoyed UCSD to it 's 
fullest "SOCially, it was the best 
four years I'd ever had ," sa id 
Flint. "The biggest thing is that 
all my greatest friend s were from 
the time I spent at UC5D." 

Aint's views have changed as 
his involvement with AlA and 
also the Shooting Stars, another 
Christian basketball team headed 
by former Harlem Globetrotter 
Meadowlark Lemon, have 
injected spirituality into his life. 

"Over the last years my 
priorities have changed since I 
have accepted Christianity into 
my life ." said Flint. "Family, 
friends and Jesus Christ have 
become more important to me 
than just basketball. But 1'\1 never 
give up my dream to go into the 
NBA" ~ 

The game not only was an 
0ppollunity for UC5D's 
beleaguered front li ne to get 
some work against seasoned 
competition , but it also gave the 
pine time players precious 
minutes to show their wares. 

·UC5D is very competitive for 
a team at the DiviSIOn III level: 
said AlA head coach Ric Nichols. 
"I was really impressed with their 
guards, especially number 22 
Oohn 5aintignon)." 

'Poetic' justice prevails for Whittier 
AlA has played to several 

soldout crowds mainly In the 
Midwest and East Coast, but 
they're game against the Chinese 

adonal team attracted over 21 
million viewers. 

So was playing in front of 
approximately 250 people m 
TritO n Pavillion a bit of a let 
down) 

.. ot at all ," said Reid Getty , a 
member of the Ph, 5/£lml1l£l 
jal1lll1a HoustOn Cougars, a team 
that boasted such player~ as 
Akeem 'The Dream" OlaJuwon 
and Clyde 'T he Glide" Drexler. 
"It doesn 't matte r If were plaYI ng 
In fro nt of a couple of people or 
20,000. We're here to hopefully 
spread the word of Jesus Chri st 
to whomever will listen. It 
doesn't matter how man y people 
are in the gym."

W HITTIER College (Il -2) is one of the class teams on the

Western region and rising. 
UCSD (8 -8) is one of the average 
teams in Division 111 , as their

record indicates. The last time 
these two teams met, one month 
ago, the Lady Poets blew out the 
Triton women, winni ng by 24 
points. They met again last 
Tuesday night. The expected 
result was another Whinier 
blowout. 

So what happened? UCSD 
nearly pulled ofT a surprising 
upset, losing 69-62. The Tritons 
played tough defense, disrupting 
Whittier's offense and causing 
numerous turnovers and keeping 
within striking distance until the 
game's fi nal seconds. 

After a ve ry slow sta rt in 
~ which Lh ey mi ssed their first

an evenly matched first half from

Whittier. 
UC5D opened the second half 

with a six point run to pull 
within one pOint. From then on , 
the game was a dogfight. The 
Poets tried to put the game away, 
but were continuously denied the 
courtesy by the more aggressive 
Tritons . 

When Poets center, Patty 
Palmer, fou led out with 4:30 
remainmg, UC5D made one final 
attempt to catch their skilled 
opponents. Backed by th e hot 
shooting of Jill Koster. they 
pulled themselves within four 
points of the Poets and had a 
chance to cut it down to twO 
with Just under 30 seconds left 
in the game. Their last minute 
heroics fell short . however, and 
Whimer escaped the Triton 
Pavillion with a victory. ' 

Greg Dincrneen, the PoctS 
coach , stated , "It was the hardest 
we had to play to win this 

season. They played a lot harder 
than we did . .. we 're just happy 
to get out of here with a ViCtory." 

Triton coach Judy Malone 
agreed with Dinerneen's 
se ntiments. "We played very 
good, aggressive defense. They 
are a very good outside shooting 
team and we were able to disrupt 
their game. If we had made our 
free throws we could've won." 

If they had only made their 
free throws. Outscoring Whittier 
from the fie ld, th e Tritons shOt 
only 42.9 percent from the line . 

Still , as guard Tracy Ragatz 
stated , "We are improving with 
evey game. We're sta lling to put 
things together." 

They had better be If they 
want another victor,' soon; the 
Tritons must now face three very 
tough teams: Azusa PaCific, 
Southern California College and 
California Baptist. ~ .

Considering the recent influence 
"African Music" has had upon 
contemporary artists, Une 1gede's 
upcoming performance should be an 
extraordinary cultural event . 

Une Igede (meaning "Drum 
Song") will be bringing their blend 
of reggae, Afro-beat, highlife, and 
juju music to the Che Cafe this 
Saturday evening at 8 pm for a night 
of dancing and learning, 

Najite Agindotan, a native of 
Nigeria, has been in the United 
States for the past decade and is in 
his third year with the band. More 
than just a musician, he has been 
involved with the Intercultural 
Awareness Program and the Los 
Angeles Unified School District. 
The sharing of his culture with 
others has also carried over to his 
music. 

"The culture is there in the music 
and that's really the whole point. 
When you hear the music and you 
begin to realize the roots of jazz, 
reggae, rhythm and blues, and ev~n 
rock, you hear something that you 
can relate to even if you don't 
understand the African language. 
But you can feel, and because you 
can feel that and experience that, you 
do experience the culture and learn 
to understand the culture better, So 
i.n a sense it won't be the whole 
culture group, but in another sense it 
will be a very good insight into the 
culture," explained fellow band 
member and UCSD student Paul 
Mattioli. 

The "culture group" to which 
Mattioli refers is that the band tries 
to bring African culture to the 
United States. They often get 
together with other Nigerians and 
not only play music but tell stories, 
conduct naming ceremonies and 
even perform ritual marriages. 

Agindotan decided to come down 
to UCSD to look for other 
musicians with whom to play. His 
fiancee at the time mentioned the 
percussionist jam sessions held in 
front of the gym on most Fridays. 
After playing with Mattioli at the 
session, he decided that "this guy has 
an understanding of the rhythms" 
and asked him to join his band. 
Following the introduction of Lynn 
Copeland, a UCSD student and bass 
player, the band was complete with 
ten members , who together have 
played at UCLA, USC, UCSD, 
sma!! clubs, and even the 1984 

lympics. 
Two year of college in Nigeria 

earned Agindotan the ordainment of 
being a "master drummer.'· Mattioli 
described Agindotan's taknt : " I've 
met a lot of master drummers, but 

/olume 14, Number 2 

Drumming 
up 

• Interest 
bv mark pinkus 

I've never met one that's as 
knowledgeable about as many 
different cultures, speaks the 
different languages, and knows all 
the corresponding drum rhythms on 
all the drums along with all the 
instrument in the ensemble as 
Najite does." 

About what he hopes t re dve 
from his !1l~ lca l endeavors, 
Agindotan remarked. "I'll fee l 
succe ful when my message in the 
music is being hea rd . And the 

message I'm about is that we are all 
from one place and one creator . I 
don't care what color you are. It's 
easy to say that, but I'm the kind of 
person that rea lly practices it." 

He later confessed, " 1 like to have 
money, don't get me wrong, but my 
main goa l is not to make this music 
to make money. 1 like to make 
people feel comfortable with life and 
to be able to deal with everybody in 
this world, with ut respect to race, 
color and the country y u're from ." 

Agindotan credited a fellow 
Nigerian and political activist, as his 
mentor . When asked if he planned 
to follow in a similar political route 
as his idol, he said, "Politics, 
everybody has views about it. I see it 
to be just a word, an English word. I 
don't use that word because 1 feel 
that anything that happens in this 
world I'm living in 1 should be 
concerned about. We should all be 
concerned. We are in this world to 
make it a better place, so when 
people say politics, I see it to mean 
the caring for the people that live on 
this earth. I've been involved since 1 
was a child because I've never liked 
to see people harmed ." 

Agindotan then immediately 
spoke out against the situation in 
South Africa: "I hate what's goingon 
in South Africa. 1 know half of this 
world does hate what's going on there 
and many people are talking a lot and 
seeing a lot and doing very little . I see 
my music to be one of those things 
that will help bring about an end to 
this stupidity and foolishness in this 
world." 

To help spread their music, l Ine 
1gede is presently in the studio 
working on an album and a 
co rresponding video . Matt ioli 
discussed the differences between 
the music here in America and the 
African music he is now making by 
explaining, "The whole African 
concept of music is different than the 
way we think of music here . Music is 
dance and performance on the 
instrument; the two are inseparable. 
The word for music over there 
means music and dance; there are 
not two separate words for it. " 

Both Mattioli and Agindotan are 
religious men, and the apparent 
undettones in their music account 
for another "difference." Agindotan 
recognizes its presence by remarking, 
" Religion is in the music because the 
music is very spiritual. It's healing 
music. 1 always leave everything up 
to God. You have a ship and God is 
the captain and He will direct and 
guide me." 

The twO men believe their musical 
talents to be gifts from God which 
they mu t therefore use. Mattioli 
believes that "everybody has a 
special talent that they've been 
besto wed with and everybody has a 
responsibility to do something 
positive for the world with it." 

Agindotan revealed his goal in life 
" to o ne day be able to touch people 
and heal them with my musi . I 
kn w 1 heal them noW, but 1 mean 
serious healing, like making the 
cripple walk or the blind ee. That 
would be my SUCCI! ."

Exploring em.otions 
by susie heel 

Quan Lelan, an undergraduate art student, cannot recall a 
time when he did not love to draw. He remembers getting 
into trouble as a child for drawing on the walls of his home. 

Ironically, when he first entered UCSD, he was enrolled as 
a computer science major. He was three classes away from a 
B.A. in computer science when he realized he could not work 
with computers for the rest of his life; he wanted to be an 
artist. 

Lelan said that the decision was preceded by a great deal of 
conflict, and inner turmoil seems to be a large part of his 
inspiration as an artist. "Some people talk to get things out, 
some people write to get things out. I paint to get things out." 
Most of his paintings depict emotion. While some artists 
paint landscapes, his paintings portray the inner world. He 
sees the mind as a tool which filters perception of the outside 
world. His thoughts and feelings become metaphorical 
images. 

One of the techniques Lelan experiments with and uses to 
portray inner turmoil and confusion is the utilization of 
strings. By dipping strings in paint and then placing them on

'86s musical overview Ihiatus 
by mark pinkus 

With 1986 already gone, 
there are a few albums that 
definitely deserve to be 
remembered. 

1) Peter Gabriel "So" 
(<;effen ~ecords) 

After a decade of merely 
critical successes, this man 
finally made it big without 
having to compromise himself 
(I.e. going the David Bowie 
route). No individual song on 
the album compares to his 
intense 1977 classic Biko, but 
'the album as a whole, filled 
with fast dance songs, moody 
slow ones, and the usual 
hypnotic background music, 
makes this not only his most 
complete work to date, but 
the best of the year. 

2) Eltlis Castello "King of 
America" (CBS ~ecords) 

Elvis fans loved this album 
and non-Elvis fans were 
quickly converted. Such 
lyrical honesry, analyzing life 
in the world which we have 
created, has not been heard 
since the early days of Dylan. 
Little Palaces and Indoor 
Fireworks are just twQ of the 
nine moving slow songs on 
this lengthy IS-song 

collection, which earns 
silver medal for '86. 

3) PeteT Case "Peter Case" 
(Geffen) 

Peter Case, the new kid on 
the block (actually he had 
been around for awhile, 
hiding out in the L.A.-based 
rock band The Plimsouls), 
combined country, folk, and 
rhythm and blues with good 
old rock 'n' roll to make one 
of the most brilliant debut 
albums of all time. Case's 
talents as a singer, songwriter, 
and guitarist shine brightly as 
his album finishes a very 
strong third. 

4) Bruce Springsteen 
nLiw/197S-8S" (CBS) 

How much more can be 
said about this man? He is the 
Boss. This overwhelming live, 
five-record set, which keeps 
the listener entranced for over 
three hours, assures everyone 
that there is not a better 
American performer around. 

Filled with storie raw 
acoustic songs, and electric 
stadium shakers, this 
collection is not to be 
considered just an all-time 
great live album, but simply 
an all-time great album. 

5) Paul Simon "(;raceland" 
(WameT Brothers) 

Sure his solo efforts since 
the dynamic duo of Simon 
and Garfunkel broke up have 
been good, but could Paul 
Simon release an album that 
ranks in the top five for the 
year? Yes, "Graceland" easily 
wins the most innovative 
album of the year award with 
its blend of South African 
"township jive," native 
chants, and intriguing lyrics. 
The album is not as powerful 
as the four above, but rather it 
subtly draws the listener in a 
manner worthy of rounding 
out the top five .

painting. Lelan has one piece 
which is painted on plexiglass 
with a light anchored behind 
the painting. As a result, light 
is not only reflected off the 
painting, but comes from the 
painting, giving it a three 
dimensional quality. 

Lelan does "painting 
performances," which he 
describes as a trip to a public 
place, such as a night club. to 
paint spontaneously for one. 

From the "Et Tu Rapo" exhibit. 

to two hours. Also interested 
in film and video, Lelan plans 
to do a painting performance 
while simultaneously showing 
a video piece. 

Lelan is reluctant to name 
artists that have influenced 
him. "No one artist really 
inspired me to paint. The 
source of my inspiration 
comes from inside." 

His paintings have some 
very universal themes. "The 
Human Mass" at first appears 
to be an example of man's 
struggle to reach the top, but a 
closer inspection reveals the 
painting to be a symbol of the 
many relationships in life. 
"Full Moon Rising" stands as 
a metaphor of anxiety without 
a definite cause. 

"Empty Room" and several 
other paintings were 
displayed in the Gallery of 
Weird New Art, which was 
located downtown until it 
closed. His latest exhibition is 
entitled "ET TU RAPO" and 
can be seen from noon to 5 
pm, January 20~23 in the 
Annex Gallery located in 
Mandeville Center.
