Appeals Comm. Comes 
Down on Foulks' Side 
McElroy Will Make the Final Decision 

By Reed Alpert 
EcU&Or 

The Personnel Appeals Com-
mittee has recommended to 
Chancellor McElroy that Day 
Care Center Josie Foulks, who 
was fired this summer, be 
reinstated, Jim Stronski , a 
government employees union 
representative said Monday. 

Vice-Chancellor of Adminis-
tration Bud Sisco said the 
committee's report is currently 
in his office and will be 
forwarded ' to McElroy after 
Sisco reviews it. Sisco said he 
did not know when he would 
forward the report to McEl-
roy but that he must do it by 
Monday, the official deadline. 

McElroy said last week that 
he anticipated agreeing with 
the committee's recommenda-
tion providing he did not find 
any glaring errors in it. He said 
that he rarely overrules Per-
sonnel Committees and that he 
expected making his decision 
Quite soon after receiving the 

recommendation. 
Foulks was dismissed from 

her job at the Day Care Center 
Aug. 17 by Laura Michetti, 
manager of business services 
and enterprises, for allegedly 
being unable to administer the 
managerial portion of her 
duties. Foulks appealed the 
decision and her appeal was 
hear by the Personnel Appeals 
Committee during the last two 
weeks in September. 

Stronski, the American 
Federation of State, County and 
Municipal Employees 
(AFSCME) representative , 
said the committee agreed "in 
one way or another" with all of 
the points made by Foulks and 
AFSCME during the hearing. 

According to Stronski , 
AFSCME had argued that the 
business office, which super-
vises the Day Care Center, had 

not provided Foulks with 
enough clerical support, the 
area in which Foulks was 
charged to be lacking. Stronski 
said the committee agreed with 
this and also concurred that 
Foulks had not been given fair 
warning by the business office 
that she was performing 
unsatisfactorily. 

Stronski said AFSCME and 
Foulks wilJ take the case to 
court if Foulks is not reinstated 
as Day Care Center Director. 

McElroy said the action 
against Foulks had nothing to 
do with the sit-in that occurred 
Spring Quarter in which 21 
students were arrested . He 
added that the audit of the DCi)' 
Care Center this summer that 
resulted in Foulks' dismissal 
was routine and the University 
is constantly auditing fifteen or 
twenty of its units. 

Ac. Senate Petitioned 
By Steve Mol'UI 

A petition signed by 263 
students requesting UCSD's 
Academic Senate to reconsider 
its action establishing new 
standards for the awarding of 
graduation honors was passed 
along to the chairman of the . 
Senate with an unfavorable 
recommendation by the Coun-
cil of Provosts last Monday. 

The petition, circulated by 
Muir Senior Rick Labowe , 
specifically asks the Provosts 
to recommend to the Senate 
that the old standards be 
extended to cover students who 
were enrolled at the time of the 

change. This proposal would 
have the effect of delaying the 
implementation of the new 
standards for four years . 
Labowe's petition was ~or­
warded by the Provosts with 
one member in favor and three 
against. 

In their memorandum ac-
companying the petition the 
Provosts presented arguments 
both in support of the petition 
and against it. In the petition's 
favor the Provosts pointed out 
that "the University has 
traditionally followed the 
policy of using a 'grandparent 
clause' for major changes in 

graduation requirements. The 
change in the standards for 
honors should be treated 
similarly. " 

Against the petition they 
argued that "the change in 
honors levels is not a major 
change in graduation require-
ments. TheBe levels are not 
specified in the Catalog . 
Rather, the Catalog just 'uses 
terminQlogy such as 'excel-
lent ,' 'superior' or 'excep-
tional' gradepoint averages to 
refer to the standards for 
honors. The action of the Senate

New Era Opens for Communications 
By LyneUe Tom 

According to Communica-
tions Professor Mike Real, 
UCSD will see "an entirely new 
era for the Communication~ 
Program " beginning this 
academic year. 

DUring the past eight years, 
the Communications faculty 
has not always been able to 
express such optimism. The 
actual opening of Third College 
in 1970 occurred at the height of 
nationwide student unrest. 
UCSD itself became a victim. A 
list of demands compiled by a 
Third World student coalition 
was sent to the administration. 
Under the threat of student 
demonstrations, the adminis-
tration coaceded to some of 
thoae demands. This action 
changed the ori,inal plan for 

hird as a traditional collele to 
an interdilciplinary campu . 
From that list, known as the 
Lumumba-Z pata document, 

emerged. the Communications 
Program, as well as three other 
academic programs. 

Best characterized in a 1973-
1974 course description, Com-
munications is "an inter-
disciplinary, social sciences-
oriented program, whose core 
curriculum is analytical of the 
process of Communications." 
To achieve this objective, the 
program is divided into three 
areas of analysis: macro (mass 
communications) , micro (face-
to-face, verbal/non-verbal 
interaction) and media (tech-
nical application through 
television, film, radio, journa-
lism, etc.). In addition to a 
concentration in Communica-
tions alone, the prolram also 
provides studies in Communi-
cations/Sociology and Com-
munications/Visual Arts. 

"We see Communications a 
social process and an involved 
thine that aeedI to be looked at 

from variol\s points of view in 
terms of research, method-
ology and articulation," said 
Communications/Visual Arts 
Professor Claudio Fenner-
Lopez. 

However, by no means should 
Communications be considered 
a vocational program, said 
Fenner-Lopez. 

" We're not training the 
students to become techni-
cians," emphasized Fenner-
Lopez. " Instead, we hope to 
bring thinking people into the 
media ." 

As a result of the program's 
ambitious goal, student re-
sponse towards it has increased 
phenomenally . Currently 
ranked 7th in declared majors, 
the enrollment now totals over 
330. 

"There are a lot of thin, 
which excite those who are 
lookinl into the prolram," 
stated Fenner-Lopez. 

In spite of riSing student 
popularity , the Communi -
cations Program has a mall 
staff. At the time of its es-
tablishment, the Communica-
tions staff consisted of 3.5 full-
time positions . Eight years 
later, the number remains 
unchanged. 

" With the power vested in 
departments, it' a real no-
man's land here," explained 
Real. 

The small faculty has pro-
duc d evere implications for 
the students . For example, 
while the averale faculty load 
at UCSD is 225 students per 
year, the number in Communi-
cations has been as high as 800. 

"Servicing to the needs of the 
students is often difficult and 
taxing ," admitted Fenner-
Lopez. " And I can't cloae my 
door to them." 

F R rces 
Another a arent 

a deficiency in resources, a 
subject that elicits conflicting 
views . According to Vice-
Chancellor of Academic Affairs 
Paul Saltman, the Communica-
tions Program .. ha plenty of 
resource ." Sal tman was 
referring to the In tructional 
Media Center under the direc-
torship of Dan Sulli an. 

Real aid, however, that, 
" Contrary to how other aca-
demic units have been built and 
how the best communication 
:iepartment in other colleges 
and universities have been 
developed, the Communica-
tions Program is exclu ivelyan

" 'Everything we worked so hard for was tom apart ... He 
brought the entire party down.' " 

Speakiq about tbe former 
president on and off the record, 
Republicans on Capitol HiU 
agree nearly ten-to-one that 
Richard Nixon shouid not 
venture out duriDI the current 
campaip on bebalf of GOP 
candidatel. "I've got a louIb 
enOUlh battle for re-election." 
one Republican senator said, 
"even witbout tbe Nixon 
albatroas around my neck." 

Althou.h tbere has been 
much softening of Republican 
animosity toward Nixon over 
the past few years, most party 
members express continuing 
disfavor with the ex-president 
and lay blame for the lopsided 
Democratic majorities in both 
houses squarely on Nixon's 
Casa Pacifica doorstep. 
. Southern Republicans re-

main especially embittered 
against the party leader they 
believe destroyed the GOP's 
entire " Southern strategy." 
The Republican Party, they 
note, had been making steady 
gains in the New South for 20 
years - until Nixon's disgrace 
undid decades of patient 
political work. 

"He ' s done tremendous 
Letters 

I would, but I would not take tbe 
initiative." Like many . Re-
publican leaders around the 
country, tbe Alabama con-
sreuman said he can see DO 
future role for Nixon in any 
public service. 

Another Soutberner, Rep. 
James G. Martin of North 
Carolina, said, "I think he will 
achieve a somewhat hilber 
profile through his own efforts 
with the press. but I don't think 
be wiU ever be viable in the 
political arena again." Martin 
said he believes Nixon no 
longer presents a threat to the 
party but neitber does he 
consider the former president 
an asset. 

Like many other 'successful 
candidates, Dickinson and 
Martin rode out the Republican 
election disaster of 1974 by 
divorcing themselves from the 
Nixon image that brought 
defeat to party loyalists who 
supported the former president 
until the bitter end. 

Since then, more and more 
Republican candidates, as one 
Washington source put it, have 
learned to treat Nixon like 
" political arsenic." By the 1976

was ".tay away from 'fat cat' 
ima.ery.·· 

Tbus the carnpaip poatel'lof 
Rep. William S. Cohen of Maine 
- oaeof the few RepubJicanson 
the Judiciary Committee to 
lurvive the votel'l' wrath in 
1974 - showed bim in Jeana aDd 
workahirt, not in a GOP three-
piece auit. In um, Rep. Arlan 
StJ'angeland of Minnesota rode 
to victory perched on a tractor. 
Anotber reason he defeated a 
heavily-favored Democratic 
opponent was that he did not 
run on the ticket of the old 
Nixon Party. He called himself, 
even on the ballot, an Independ-
ent-Republican. 

Though the examples were 
numerous, the strategy was the 
same. Republicans had to seem 
to be hardly Republican at all. 
Thus the party divorced itself 
from the Nixon years, tipped its 
hat to Gerald Ford, struck up 
the reform movement band and 
embraced the concept of a " do· 
something Congress ." It be-
came vita l for many Repub-
licans to pretend they were not 
so much for the party as for 
independent pursuit of Re-

seconds you surely have rea-

designed with you in mind, 
unless assimilation is your 
stroke; and there are quite a 
few of you here and that's no 
joke . But for you concerned 
about your environment the 
problem is this: A problem not 
new to you but simply re-
worded. It reads as follows: A 
vote was taken on the naming of 
" Third College", you know one 
of those democratic votes. Two 
hundred on one side, you and 
your best friend on the otber. 
Ballots are counted, tbe results

a landsUde, "280 against and 2

numbers but the value of the 
opposers ia cbanged from

nority." Yet tbere is no argu-
ment that the procell was DOt 
democratic. Alter aU "2 for"

case always makes ilieU rigbt.

once feel that the majority 
picks only on Black People, 
they have just begun their 
studies on Latin peoples and 
really find it convenient to 
study Asian peoples on the 
after-effects of still trying to 
blow them to bits. 

Now, since the "majority" is

WASHINGTON (AP) 
President Carter restored 
citizenship rights posthu-
mously Tuesday to Confederate 
President Jefferson Davis and 
declared that post-Civil War 
reconciliation is finally com-
plete. 

He said the bill he signed 
"officially completes the long 
process of reconciliation that 
has reunited our people fol-
lowing the tragic conflict 
between the states," Carter 
said. 

Davis, who was president of 
. , 

the Confederacy a century ago, 
was left out of congressional 
resolutions restoring rights to 
other rebel officials. 

" He had served the United 
States long and honorably as a 

soldier, member of the U.S. 
House and Senate and as 
secretary of war," Carter 
recalled. 

" General Robert E. Lee's 
citizenship was restored in 
1976. It Is fitting that Jeffer-
son Davis should no longer be 
singled out for punishment." 

" Our nation needs to clear 
away the guilts and enmities of 
recriminations of the past, to 
finally set at rest the divisions 
that threatened to destroy our 
nation and to discredit the great 
principles on which it was 
founded," Carter said. 

"Our people need to tum 
their attention to the important 
tasks that still lie before us in 
establishing those principles 
for all people."

Carter 
Helpful 

NASHVILLE, Tena. (AP) -
President Carter's respons-
iveness to the needs of black 
people has increased during the 
past year, the president of the 
National Urban League says. 

"I think there has been a 
sincere and more concerted 
ellort toward solving the 
problems of black people put 
forth by the Carter adminis-
tration during the past year," 
Vernon Jordan said Monday. 

Last year Jordan sharply 
criticized Carter's proposals 
for the welfare program, 
saying the president had 
neglected the needs of the 
nation's urban poor. But 
Monday, Jordan said he sees 
signs Carter is more respon-
sive to problems affecting 
blacks.

Poloists Take State, Now 7-3 
ByJ_Goeu 

S&aff Writer 
The second half defense beld 

San Diego State to one ,oal 
Tbursday, 88 UCSD over-
powered the A&teca ... in the 
losing team's pool: 

The win marked the first time 
the Tritons bad ever beaten the 
Aztecs at San Die,o State. 
AloOl with two other victories 
over Clairemont-Mudd and 
Pomona-Pitzer this weekend, 
the UCSD aeuon record stands 
at an imprellive seven wins 
and three losses. 

In the first half, the Tritons 
fell behind 3-5. The defense then 
turned around to shut down the 
Aztec attack, allowing them no 
goals. UCSD seized the oppor-
tunity to pump in three goals, 
taking the lead 6-5. Two more 
fourth quarter goals made the 
final score 8~. 

Dan Eby scored three Urnes 
in the game. Toby Raymond 
twice, and Dan Crane, Kai 
Loedel and newly selected 
team captain Tom Jor,ensen 
each put in one ,oal. 

Jor,ensen, a senior, was the 
last of the old UCSD players to 
bave never beaten the Aztecs 
on the road. In 1m, he tallied 
two ,oals in the natatorium to 
help defeat State 18-7. 

A changed Triton defense 
emefled from the pool, with 
hard outside pressure and only 
five defenaive ejections. Last 
week against Whittier, UCSD 
players were kicked out 16 
times, and almost balf those 
kickouts led to Whittier goals . 

But the defense is still 
sporadic. "It's inconsistent. 
It's up one quarter and down 
the next-kind of a rollercoaster 

" commented coach Russ 

Polol pIa b ror die ball. UCSD came up with it more oUen 
than tate, and won 8-4. --- _ ............ 

"Numerous times we forced 
the other team to dump the ball. 
Our outside pressure is ex-
cellent. Everyone is ,ood at 
times, but everyone geta ticked 
out too," said Haffertamp. 

On Saturday the team 
traveled to Clairemont to playa 
doublebeader. Clairemont-
Mudd, wbo edged UCSD 15-12 
last year, swam against the 
Tritons in the first game that 
morning. "It was another 
defeat we wanted to avenge," 
said the Triton coach. 

Clairemont-Mudd played an 
aggressive first half and Crane 
was ejected from the game on a 
major foul. Tied 4-t at halftime, 

UCSD again let loose in the 
third quarter, scoring four 
goals and only allowing one. 
Tbree more Triton goals 
finished off Clairemont-Mudd 
11-9. Loedelscored three goals 
in the ,arne, and Mark Gordon, 
Jeff Elliott, Eby and Raymond 
each put In two. 

After a.two-hour rest, UCSD 
took on Pomona-Pitzer_ Tbe 
tired starters fell to a 5-2 deficit 
in the second quarter , so 
Haflerkamp pulled all the 
players out of the pool except 
for goalie Willie Morris, and put 
in the next team. Tbey didn 't 
score - but they didn 't let in 
any goals either. 

Tbe top six, energized after 
their brief bencbing, scored 
eight goals in the next hall to 
swamp Pomona-Pitzer, U ... . 
Loedel a,ain led the scoring 
with three, Jorgensen, Gordon 
and Crane bad two. and Bob 
Owsley and Dan Eby eacb 
scored once. 

The team, which bas now won 
four straight, is build in, 
momentum with each win . 
"The guys are breeding con-
fidence; they're getting more 
and more each day . Beating 
State did a whole lot for us. We 
knew it was possible. The guys 
just put their mind to it," said 
Hafferkamp.

Padfte Nen Service 

ReUle JacUon of the New 
York Yankees, with typical 
modesty, told ·an ABC-TV 
interviewer duriq the recent 
playoff series with the Kansas 
City Royals that he is a 
reliiious man, prays to God 
daily and that God helps him hit 
home runs. As Winston Church-
ill once said of a rival, "There 
but for the grace of God, goes 
God." 

Tom Lasorda, manager of 
the Los Angeles Dodiers, prays 
to the Big Blue Dodger in the 
Sky. His rival manager, Danny 
Ozark of the Philadelphia 
Phillies, predicted the Phils 
wQuld beat the Dodgers be-
cause he wears the No. 3 and it 
was the third playoff meeting 
between the two team!' . Every 
major league baseball team 
now has fervent Christian 
"born-again" players, who 
hold prayer services in the 
clubhouses and Christian 
retreats in the off-season.

If baseball players, 100, 
known to be a rascalloUi bunch, 
are getting rellglon, It's also 
fair to say that the national 
pastime illelf has become a 
kiod of rellgloo to Americans. 
The season jUit ended was a 
record one for the game, with 
over 40 mlllion fans attending. 
The sport that many predicted 
would die out, fadini to the 
increased popularity of football 
and buried by TV, has come 
back stronger than ever in our 
affections. 

It has been the most exciting 
baseball season in years - a 
season that, even when it was 
over, was not over. The Red Sox 
led their nearest competition 
by over 10 games until the last 
month, swooned in September 
and then came back to tie the 
Yankees and force a one-game 
playoff. During the dreadful 

September collapse, the statiJ-
tics on cblld abuse and wife 
beatiq in Boaton soared. The 
old mao comes home from 
work tired and bot, has a few 
beers, watches the Red Sox let 
creamed and takes it out on the 
kid. and wife. Who says 
baseball .. only a lame? In 
Boston It's a sacred tradition. 

In the West, the most exciting 
story was the San Francisco 
Giants, not because they won 
the championship - they 
finished third behind the 
Dodgers and Reds - but 
because of their enormous 
improvement. They held first 
place most of the season and 
broke the all-time major league 
record for one-run victories 
with 42. It was a rare Giants 
game that didn't go right <:Iown 
to the wire, heart in throat, as 
the San Francisco attendance 
soared from 700,000 in 1977 to 1.7 
million this year.

and said, "Thanks be to God." 

It a ll seems crazy , but that's 
how we a re about our national 
pastime. Like Argentines with 
their soccer, we simply go nuts. 
We imagine that the nine 
players on the field actually 
represent the city they play for, 
even though they may all live 
somewhere else and may be 
playillg for a different team 
next year. 

Rod Carew, who's fervently 
Jewish, black and Pana -
manian, is easily the most 
fa mous Minneapolitan in 
Min nesota , notwi thstanding 
the racist remarks of the 
Twins' owner, Calvin Griffiths. 
Philadelphia Mayor Frank 
Rizzo, who recently urged 
voters to "vote white," none-
theless supports the Phillies' 
many black players. 

The public nastiness this year 
was mostly concentrated in 
New York and Los Angeles, the 
cities that also sport the 
strongest teams. Dodgers Don 
Sutton and Steve Garvey had 
their highly-publicized fist 
fight, and Yankees Manager 
Billy Martin was fired a,ain, 
then re-hired for the 1910 
season. But savvy observers in 
New York are predictin, that 
Martin won't be back. 

And now the World Series. 
Vanks and Dodgers fans are 
having their moments of 
hysteria while millions more 
watch with controlled degrees 
of passion. 

We cling to the World Series 
because it is the end. Aftt'r

arred by Script, "Nicely Played 
ByWWlamGI ...... 

Gola' Soa&., a new film 
starriDI and directed by Jack 
Nlcbolaon, Ia plaYinI currently 
at the Fashion Valley Cinema. 

Thla script, written by John 
Herman, Ia the most cliched, 
hackneyed, improbable ren-
dering of the scruffY-Nlt-good-
hearted- horse- thief- meets-
demure- but- beautiful- and-
self-sufficient- woman- then-
they-fall-in love Western tale 
I've ever witnessed. The viewer 
is led through a maze of ridicu-
lous occurrences which have no 
real cohesiveness except in the 
mind of the viewer who has 
seen the story played before his 
eyes a thousand times before. 
The only surprises come with 
the realization that nowhere 
does this script deviate from its 
relentless corniness . The 

slapstick humor, dependent on 
deceivinl the viewer, then 
revealinl another alOnWq 
frontier ritual from the frames 
of BouDza or Ba&dl Cauldy, 
threatens to enaulf the actors 
and the viewer in a monotonous 
drone of cliches. Though some 
real problems concerning 
sexual roles. are treated sen-
sitively, the script as a whole 
moves disjointedly from one 
stereotypic scene to another. 

The film, however, is de-
lightful; there are two reasons 
for this, Jack Nicholson and 
Mary Steenburgen. 

For me , Nicholson'S 
.charismatic persona always 
transcends that of the charac-
ter he is playing. Perhaps, then, 
it is a blessing that he chose 
such a cliched script ; the 
archetypical role he plays

serves as a background alainst 
which may be seen his mar-
velous vitality as an actor and 
person. His wizened face and 
befuddled demeanor prac-
tically' explode into hilarious 
grimaces, his home-spun 
philosophy is delivered with 
such verve that, while one 
doesn't believe him for a 
minute, one is certain that he 

believes it himself. He assumes 
the reckless abandon of the 
Cowboy naturally, has easily 
the best insane glint oC the eyes 
in Hollywood. His directing , 
while good, might best be 
described as safe. He t.lkes few 
chances on his first outing an~ 

the occaaional deviations from 
tbe DOrma of the genre are 
easily spotted. There are even a 
few arty touches, but for the 
most part the pacing and 
camera placement are formu-
laic. 

The opening credits read: 
introducing Mary Steenburgen. 
I have a feeling that this 
introduction will prove an 
important one for lovers of 
commercial films . Ms. Steen-
burgen apparently didn't come 
to the role with a lot of 
preconceptions about its in-
credible banality. She infuses 
the character with ingenuity 
and freshness , refuses to be a 

caricature and is very beauti-
ful besides; she even manages 
to reduce our anguish oC 
recGlDitioo durine the chase-
the- lover- out· in- the- rain-and-
fall-in-the-mud scene through a 
marvelous sympathy for the 
character's practically non-
existent possibilities as a 
human being. It is amazing that 
these two actors can take a 
stereotyped plot; complete with 
the Evil Landlord, the Sleazy 
Mexican (played predictably 
well by John Belushi) and leave 
the viewer with the Ceellng of 
having experienced a warm, 
buman story. That, however, is 
the feeling I had leaving the 
theater. 

Rock Critic's Woes; 
A " Beat Goes Thump 

By Ted Navin Burke 
In the Muir Five and Dime, 

where the sandwiches are 
soaked in sheep dip and the 
coffee tastes like brake fluid, 
anast-ridden rock critic Tad 
BerlUlOlis was giving erst-
while film theorist 8teve 
Esperanto a dead fish stare as 
be worked his way throuJh a 
maDlY salad covered with an 
acidic, lumpy white goo that 
passed for blue cbeese 
dres8iq. ~teve had just dis-
alreect with Tad's recent 
record review of tbe Stones' 
Some GIrta album, and Tad, 
DeVer one to back away from an 
arJUlllent, chewed his salad 
Into a groaty pulp before he 
mounted his counterattaclt . 
Steve merely stroked his Simon 
LeGree-cwn·Fu Mancb mus-
tache and lit a Kool with a flick 
of his Bic. 

"You know," I8YS Tad 
finally, wiping some flotsam off 
his lips with his sbirt sleeve," 
I've been gettinl a lot of ltatiC 
from die-bard Stones fans 
who've been telling methatl'm 
full of rot, saying that the bad 
thinls I said about Some Girls 
were unfounded in reality and 
that I should have kept my 
opinions to myself. Jesus, they 
act as though I'd ur,ed the 
violent overthrow of tbe gov-

ernment, Can't they get it 
tbroulh their head that the 
Stones' can't let it up anymore, 
and the performances, let alone 
the material on Some Girls is 
but a palUd carbon of the genius 
they used to personify?" 

Unimpreued witb Tad's 
rlnginl oratory, Steve let 
smoke trail lazily out of his 
mouth. "You don't have to 
recite wbat you wrote, 'cause I 
read the review, remember?" 
be said, "aU I said is that 
tbougb I didn't tbblk G ..... was 
tbe bat they've done, it Ia the 
best they've done in years. I 
like the album. As lOIDeoDe 
who's been bot and cold over 
Mick Jailer since the first time 
I saw them on Sltiedil, I just 
found the album a fairly 
pleasant surprise. Belides. 
you've been beating this same 
borse for years, since they 
came out with Exile On Mala 
S&ree&. Every time a new 
Stones album cornel out, I can 
predict the verbs, adjectives, 
similes and metaphors you're 
gonna use. Each time you give 
them a bad review, you get 
shriller. This time out, man, 
you've really hit the bottom, [ 
mean, saying 'Mick Jagger and 
his burned-out bandsmen oulht 
to be shot in a world-televised 
execution as a warning to other 
rock bands against putting out 
mediocre albums ' goes a bit 
beyond a critic's role to 
appraise art or product solely 
on its merits. You sound like a 
Nazi forever haranguing the 
Jews ... " 

Tad fell into a silence and lit a 
clgarette of his own. Someone 
began to play the snack bar 
piano, fumble-fingering his 
way through an Oscar Peterson 
chord progression. "Jesus," 
said Steve, "I wish these 
assholes wouldn't practice jazz.

Mother's 8-12 Levels Can Damage 8aby 
By DaU 8&. Claire BacOII 

sc.If .nlel' 

A strict veletarian mother 
breast feeding ber baby i. 
endaqerinl his life. Tbe child 
could develope a coma and die 
due to tbe Insufficient amount 
of vitamin 8-12 contained in his 
mother's milk. 

Vitamin 8-12 Is contained in 
fuh, red meat, poultry, ellS 
and milk. Strict vegetarians 
(vegans) do not eat any of these 
food products. Depending on 
the diet the vegan is not in any 
Immediate danpr. EnOUlh B-
12 Ia contained in low levels in 
other food stuffs tbey eat . 
However, over a period of time 
the vegan's body could reach 
dangerously low 8-12 levels. 

The real danger arises when 
a velan becomes pregnant. 

Nonnally, the fetus obtains the 
nutrient directly from bis 
mother'. food intake. As the 
ve,an mother does not eat 
enough 8-12 enriched food the 
fetus must rely on his mother's 
blood stream to lupply it. 
However, the velan mother is 
functiODiq on a low 8-12 level 
herself 80 ber tissues will not 
release any into ber blood. 
Consequently, her child Ia born 
8-12 deficient. Tbe child does 
not have a chance to make up 
for this deficiency if he is being 
strictly breast fed. The vegan 
mother's milk does not contain 
eoou,h of the needed nutrient. 

Vitamin 8-12 is essential for 
normal growth and neuro-
logical function. Without it 
certain compounds that the 
nutrient normally breaks down 
accumulate in the body. A low 
red blood cell level occurs 

causing anemia. The body 
reaches a point where it can't 
function at all. A comatose 
condition sets in, ending In 
death. 

This vegan diet finding was 
recently made by a group of 
UCSD doctors. These results 
were drawn from a study of a 
six-month-old child brought to 
University Hospital by his 
vegan mother. The child was 
drowsy and later fell into a 
coma . 

Investilator Dr. Lawrence 
Sweetman, Assistant Profes-
sor of Pediatrics, said that the 
child would have died in 48 
hours without proper treat-
ment. The doctors discovered 
that the child's 8-12 level was 
about 5% of normal. The infant 
was liven injections of the 

vitamin and he recovered. The 
child maintained good health 
by receiving oral doses of the 
vitamin. "Today, " Sweetman 
reports, "the child is func-
tioning normally." 

Sweetman said that after the 
publication of their discovery a 
similar case was reported in 
Philadelphia. Again, the child 
was anemic with a low 8-12 
level. Again , he was being 
nursed by a vegan mother. 
Sweetman advises, .. All vegan 
mothers should supplement 
their diet with vitamin 8-12. 
They don 't have to get the 
nutrient from an animal 

source. It is also available 
synthetically. " 

Sweetman alao urged velan 
mothers to take their child to a 
physician if they notice any 
irregular behavior . " Unfor-
tunately, " Sweetman said , 
vegans are reluctant to deal 
with organized medicine. The 
mother of the child we treated 
telephoned anonymously about 
her infant's condition a few 
months before. We told her to 
brinl bim in Cor some tests but 
she never did. The child 's 
condition would never have 
been as critical if he had been 
treated earlier." 

Reptile Study Aids Man " 
By Donald Lawson 

Recent studies of unusual 
marine reptiles, now threat-
ened with extinction, may 
provide insight into the causes 
of human water-accumulation 
diseases such as emphysema 
and the abnormal sbift of fluid 
in astronauts during weight-
lessness. 

As part of a research effort he 
described as "the most com-
plete investigation of the life of 
a lallle reptile yet devised, " Dr, 
Alan Hargens of the UCSD 
Scbool of Medicine recently 
spent more than six weeks 
studyinl green sea turtles in 
the Caribbean Sea. The re-
search was conducted aboard 
the National Science Founda-
tion research vessel Alpha 
Helix, operated by Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography 
and recently returned after 411.1 
months at sea. 

Chief scientist for the turtle 
research program , which 
involved scientists of many 
disciplines, was Dr. Henry 
Prange of the Indiana Uni-
versity School of Medicine. [n ' 
sPeaking of the turtles, Prange 

said , " Their metabolism , 
unusual for reptiles , more 
nearly resembles that of 
mammals, with an ability to 
maintain high rates of meta-
bolism over long periods of 
time. This and other types of 
physical adaptations that the 
turtles have evolved as air-
breathing aquatic animals are 
perhaps similar to those made 
by man's reptilian ancestors, 
and make the turtles usefu.1 for 
medical research." 

Hargen's studies showed that 
the turtles store about a pint of 
fresh water in their body cavity 
which is absorbed by their body 
tissues to replace water lost 
through dehydration . This 
mechanism appears to allow 
the turtles to travel at sea for 
days without eating or drink-
ing . 

Hargens said the turtles have 
very large, easily accessible 
lungs, which makes the mech-
anisms which govern the 
balance of fluids in their bodies 
especially easy to study.

arshipe and Honors CommJttee 
last May wben the resolution 
passed. "The four· year delay 

the grandfather clause would 
callie," Linck said, "would be 
!porin, the problem for too 
long." 

TbeIe fiJures, Groves said, 
fonn the buis for the target 
numbers future ,raduates 
must meet. Accordin, to 
Groves, the target numbers 
must be calculated DOW, as 
opposed to at the end of the 
year, if the graduates are to 
receive their honors with their 
diplomas. 

'Majority 
Due to the large difference 

between the percentage of 
bonor graduates at UCSD and 
her sister UC campuses, a 
"grandfather clause" was 
specifically not included in the 
resolution mandatin, these 
changes, said Robert Linck, 
Chairman of tbe Academic 

Clairemont 
(t.&. ..... pa&e S) 

(t.&. fnID pqe !) 
that sinking boat I've called the 
"majority." 

And the namiq of a colle,e 
that hopefully will attract other 
than "majority" students 
should be at least cbosen by 
them, no matter what their 
numerical standin, is. A name 
is very' important and "Third" 
rate has never been considered 
the best. Be for real, bonestly 
don't you think there are 
enough "George Washingtons" 

in our neighborhoods. 

Now what is needed is this; 
leave your name at the B.S.U. 
office in person or by phone, 
even mail it enclosed in a plain 
brown wrapper if you don't 
want to be seen. This also 
includes graduate students and 
faculty . It's time the "ma-
jority" realizes we talk too. 
Please take time to come by. 
P .S. What's your stroke'!

the albums down to Arcade 
Records and sell them for two 
bucks apiece." Steve laughed 
.and flicked his Bic again, the tip 
of the flame igniting the end of 
his Kool. 

Tad, however, wasn't in a 
good mood, and let his face sag 
like a jellyfish that'd been 
swept to shore by a stron, tide. 
His eyebrows were arcbed like 
an A-frame, making his fore-
head furrowed with lines deep 
as irrigation ditches. His eyes 
became lifeless, bombed-out 
craters, with only the faint light 
from a light fixture revealing 
his pupils . Steve laughed 
harder, knowing that Tad 
enjoyed putting himself into a 
despairing funk from time to 
time. He knew Tad was some-
one who was going to have an 
existential dilemma, even if he 
had to create the reason for it. 
He wasn 't goin, to let him get 
away with it tbis time. Steve 
spoke up. 

" So whataya gonna do, 
blood? Burn your record 
collection? Blow your brains 
out? Write film reviews in-
stead? Write a novel? Join the 
carnival? Pump gas? All this 
sbit gets me down too, but it's 
part of the spread. You're 
never gonna get away from 
being world· weary or anything 
like that. It's ,onna follow you. 
Now you sound as though 
you ' re gonna make some 
important decision that's 
gonna change your life. What· 
aya gonna do? " 

"I'm gonna pretend this 
conversation never happened," 
replied Tad, sitting upright 
suddenly as though he'd just 
frenched kissed a live lfght 
socket," and get back to 
business ... " The pianist had 
become louder, and was now 
ban,ing the keys with the 
finesse of a chainsaw. "Yeah," 
said Tad, " one thing I hate 
worse than most jazz in general 
is bad jazz in particular." He 
picked up his coffee cup, still 
half-full, crammed a mountain 
of napkins into it, and threw it 
at the pianist. Tbe cup hit him in 
the back of the neck, with tbe 
soaked napkins leavin, coffee 
stains on his white Mexican 
wedding shirt. Tbe pianist 
turned around to see who'd 
done the deed . 

"So what do you tbink of 
Bowie's ability to elevate 
rla,iarism from mere thievery 
lO hi'h art?" asked Tad. Steve 
ust llicked his ubiquitous Bie.

S udent Role Stressed in Program 
(Con,. 't page 1) 
studs ," added Communica-
tions A 'nistrative Assistant 
Jane Levin. 

QNIl'y Qundoned 
"The.e problems were 

brought to the attention of the 
Academic Senate's Commit-
tee on Educational Policy 
(CEP) , whose five members 
compiled a report on the 
Communications Program 
during the 1977-1971 academic 
year. In it, the committee 
spelled out the program's 
strengths and weaknesses and 
its recommendations for solv-
ing those difficulties. Although 
the report was not a public 
document, one of UCSD's 
newspapers, the new lDcUca&or, 
gained access to the report and 
published it; causing some 
tension between the Communi-
cations students and CEP. 
Newly-appointed CEP Chair-
man Tom Bond said he intends 
to erase any uneasy feelings 
which may still exist. 

"I'm trying to diffuse the 
situation from what it was 
previously," he said. "I don't 
want the attitude felt that CEP 
was blatantly opposed to 
Communications.' , 

Coordina&or Appoin&ed 
Steps have been taken to 

resolve, if not eliminate, the 
handicaps plaguing the Com-
munications Program. Per-
haps of the most importance is 
the appointment of Dr. Michael 
Cole as coordinator. Although 
the former Rockefeller Uni-
versity professor has only been 

in office for a month, he has 
drawn up a two-part process for 
reorganizing the Communica-
tions Program. Phase one 
consists of reviewing the 
program and bringin, its 
curriculum up to par with CEP 
standards. 

"We're trying to form a 
coherent plan of what it is to 
study Communications by 
finding realistic and meaning-
ful curriculum, articulatin, the 
information into some form of 
documentary, and bringing it 
before the Committee on 
Educational Policy,'" ex-
plained Levin. 

Phase two is devoted in 
increasing the participation of 
faculty in other departments. 
In the past, the relationship 
between the faculty in Com-
munications and other de-
partments has been termed by 
Cole as "an image of a dog and 
cat chasing each other in a 
circle." 

"We need the respect and 
cooperation of the otber de-
partments," he added. "The 
difficulties are proportional to 
their degree of acceptance." 

In addition to Cole as coor-
dinator, the faculty has been 
increased to include three new 
instructors; James Levin 
(computer interaction), Luis 
Moll (bilingual communica-
tions) and Ken Traupmann 
(communications disorders). 

The administration is also 
helping the Communications 
Program to become, in Salt-
man's wordsL"an interdis-

ciplinary program with class, 
coherence and cognition." 
Professor Real hopes this will 
put Communications "on the 
verge of developing a strong 
and effective role nationally 
as a center of original research 
and lea min,. " 

CSU As a Fac&or 
The program development 

process doesn't fall upon the 
Communications faculty and 
administration alone. The 
Communications Students 
Union (CSU) has been a major 
contributing factor in the 
development of the Communi-
cations Program, and will 
continue to be so. In an attempt 
to offer students the oppor-
tunity for a public outlet for 
their technical knowledge, the 
union has created Community 
and Student Media Services 
(CASMS). Under this new 
project, students on a volunteer 
basis work on media-oriented 
projects within the community. 

"It's good for the program, 
it's good for the community and 
it's good for the students," said 
CSU Chairperson Christy 
Drale. "It also adds substance 
to the union so that instead of it 
being an organization that has 
just an opinion, it has a goal and 
takes action." 

An already extablished CSU 
project is the Student Film 
Festival, held in early spring. 
Although the festival has been 
hampered in past years by the 
lack of organization, Drale 
feels .. confident that the 

students will achieve all their 
projects, because we have 
some genuinely interested 
people who are committed and 
willing. They start off and 
follow through." . 

Recently joining forces with 
CSU is the Associated Students 
(AS), who have set up a board 
to extensively review the 
Communications Program via 
feedback from its majors. 
Depending on its funding, the 
board will also be involved in 
establishing a forum of speak-
ers from the Communications 
Program, the administration 
and other departments to talk 
on the Communications issue, 
as well as assisting the pro-
gram in its progress report to 
CEP. Under the directorship of 
Maio Lashley, the board is still 
in its planning stages. 

At &be Crossroads 
The program will arrive at a 

crucial turning point at the end 
ofthis fall quarter. Thatis when 
CEP will evaluate Communi-
cations and determine in which 
direction it will go. 

Among the possibilities, of 
course, is the complete phasing 
out of the program. 

"It will not only be a loss for 
the people presently working 
within the Communications 
Program, but it will also be a 
loss for the future of the 
University as a place of 
academic leadership, and it 
will be a loss for the ' many, 
many people who put a whole 

lot of energy into originating, 
developing and organizing the 
program in ·the past," said 
Real. 

Another solution is the 
continuation of the program as 
it is, Drale said, which could 
include the alternatives of 
"keeping the elements that 
the program already has or 
homogenizing it into a middle-
of-the-road program." 

The third possibility is the 
hoped-for status as a depart-
ment. As far as Saltman is 
concerned, this is a "dead 
18lue." And although there has 
been considerable talk pre-
viously on the prospect of 
receiving departmental status, 
it is not a top priority objective 
now. 

"Personally, I'm not con-
vinced on whether or not the 
program will go in thhi direc-
tion," said Cole. 

"We don't have the privilege 
of working for it as an im-
mediate goal because we're not 
in the position of negotiating 
it," said Drale. 

Whatever direction the Com-
munications Program will 
take, CEP Chairman Bond 
places great emphasis on the 
fact that the committee's 
decision "cannot dramatically 
effect the existing Communi-
cations students. 

"CEP feels very strongly for 
the students in Communica-
tions and for the campus as a 
whole."
