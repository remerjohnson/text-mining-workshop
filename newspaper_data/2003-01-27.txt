Nuclear: Grad students to look at weapons 
conlinued from page r 

educa tional careers of two cohorts of 
graduate students in 2003 and 2004. 
The program starts this fall. 

Graduate students from any 
area of sntdy are eligible for the 
fell owship support as long as they 
demonstrate academic interests 
related to public policy and tech-
nology issues surrounding nuclear 
weapons. 

Snldents who are chosen for the 
program will partici pate in inten-
sive umffier training, interdiscipli-
nary seminars and policy work-
shops on the historical, politica l 
and technological issues concern-
ing nuclear weapons. They will also 
be able to work as inte rns at 
Lawrence Livermore and Los 
Alamos National laboratories, both 
of which are managed by the 

University (of California, as well as 
work in Washington , D.C., ,md 
abroad . 

Both faculty and Ph.D. snldents 
from dIe nine UC campuses wi ll be 
involved in dIe program. Bee said 
that IGC expects students from 
the areas of physics, engineering, 
political science and hi tory to 
apply. 

"This is an incredible opportu-
nity for students to get their doc-
torates paid for," Bee said. 

The organi zation has already 
received over 50 applications from 
across the nation. 

"I think this is a great program," 
said Eleanor Roosevelt Coll ege 
sophomore Kristine Barcarse. 
"Especially in times like these, with 
what's been going on in the j\ I iddle 
Easl, we need the best of the best 

Out there." 
Based at UCSD, IGCC is a 

sta tewide UC research center that 
studies the causes of internatio nal 
confli ct and helps devise options 
for solving conflicts through inter-
national conflict. 

The IGERT grant was given to 
the UC system in part because of 
its management of the country's 
chief nu Icar weapons laboratnries, 
Lawrence Livermore and Los 
Alamos. 

Susan Shirk of the U SO 
Graduate School of Internation:tl 
Relations and Pacific Studies is in 
charge of the project. Others 
involved from UCSD include 
Barbara Walter of [RIPS, as well as 
David Lake, Philip Roecler and 
William Chandler of the political 
science department. 

Landscape: Planners, residents brainstorm 
continued from paRe r 

$50,000 from the city budget for 
thc second phase of the project. I Ie 
hopes to attract private ectors to 
volunteer labor and materials after 
the residents decide on what they 
want built. The budget for the 
entire project will depend on the 
plan that the communi ty decides to 
implcment. 

,'v1irchell Berner of Publi c 
olu tions, a public relations firm, 

also assured those present that by 
finding people who want to help 
the community, "the project can be 
done" with lime cost to the govern-
meill.

the idewa lks and the medians for

two feet to nine feet in width. 
Phase I consisted of placing 57 
trees 011 Governor Drive with 100 
more still to be planted. 

According to Peters, residents 
of University City were quick to 
express thei r desi re to bea uti fy 
Uni\'cnity City. Community mem-
bers pointed out problems with 
traffic, speeding ami narrow side-
walks that barely accommodate the 
large number of nldents from the 
nearby chools on weekdays. 

Residents suggested a range of 
idea, from fountains with different 
lighting to murals and creative 
foliage. Variou themes, induding 
the lI1ulti -generational family, chil-
dren and athletics were "1'0 pro-
posed. 

"There's such a diversity of 
backgrounds and education in this 

neighborhood th at a forum can 
bri ng consensus wi thi n the com-
munity'" said UCCA Vice 
President and University City resi-
dent Hugh Pares.

OPINION 

Affirmative action is needed to create 
on equal and just American society 

By JESSICA UNGEL 
AssOCIate OpInion Editor 

In a perfect world, we wouldn't need 
missile defense systems, welfare or the death 
penalry. We wouldn't need prisons or 
police . And we certainly wouldn't need 
af~irmarive action . 

Pres, dent John F. Kennedy coined the 
phrase "affinnaove aceon" In the I 960s, and 
Jt the ome, It meant a number of measure, 
that would cncour.!ge integraoon in federall), 
funded jO~. Forty years and eight preslden~ 
Idter, the ,eml applies to anum 

dence to an applicant solely on the basi of 
race. They make accusations that such 
treatment is III itself racist, that people 
shouldn 't be given an advantage just because 
of their background. and that if we really 
wanted to be fair, we'd be blind to race 
entirely. But that's an over-simplification of 
an overly complex issue. 

Affirmaove action can be defended in 
two ways, first as a method of creating a 
diverse environment and second as a 
method of combating racl~m. 

In the specific Instance of admiSSions 
boards considering race as 3 fac-

ocr of programs aJmed ~: help-
ing IIlJllorities, and nowhere IS 
the bJtue for affirmative action

school. 

PRO 
ror for acceptance, people have 
ro accept the fact tha t good 
grades do not neces arily make 
you a better candidate for col-
lege. It I~n't a question of pick-
ing the ~lI1aneSt kids who 
applied, It's a question of picking 

TIle dispute centers around 
the university's admissions system, which is 
based on awarding points for different fac-
IOrs about the applicant. Although 
President George W. Bu,h has reduced the 
rather complex process to a single com pan -
~(Jn of pointS - lisring the values given 10 
SAT scores and race - the: fact is that a StU-
dent's acadentic record is by far the most 
Important factor. Out of a total 150 points, 
acadeillics compTise I 10, with grade, 
alilountlOg 10 80 points and standardized

And for some people, that's ~ problem.

Race-based choices are wrong 
and Dr. King would disapprove 

By RYAN DAlBY 
Senior Staff Writer 

In the wake of Martin Luther King, Jr. 
Day, we can only imagine whar the late civil 
rights champion would think of racial dis-
crimination in our country today. How sad-
dened would he be ifhe knew that almost 35 
years after his assassination, our schools 
would sull judge their applicantS by race? 
How would he feel ifhe knew that adminis-
trators speak more frequently about ti,e 
color of their studentS' skin than the content 
of their character? 

After dedicating - and even-

best man getting the job is terribly under, 
mined by affi rmative action, which allows 
less qualified applicantS to be awarded POSI -
tion based on the color of their skin. It is 
raci t, and it i not fair. 

Affirmative action sends a detrimental 
message of inferiority to ethnic communities 
who start to believe it. To say that it is neces-
ary is no different than sa)llng these people 

are not good enough to achieve admission by 
their own meritS. If the leaders of ethnic com-
munities continue to be quoted IIlcc>sancly ill 
the news media as proponentS of affirmative 

action rather than personal 
responsibility, the members of 

tually sacrificing - his life in the 
pursui t of raCial equality, Dr. 
King would surely be devastated 
if he knew such discnmlilauon 
wa still rampant in our society. 
Sadly, he would be even more 
dl~traught if he knew that such 

(ON that community - especially the youths - lose ight of the 1110S1 important factor in achieving one's goals: hard work. If an entire generation sees its 
leaders emphasizing social enti-
dement rather than hard work, 
why i it any surprise tllat mem-raCIStS daim to lead the civil 

rightS movement he gave birth to, one wh.ich 
no longer seeks equality, but rather entitle-
ment. 

Indeed, the civil rightS movement has 
been hijacked by race-mongering political 
entrepreneurs whose claims at seeking racial 
equality are instantaneously invalidated by 
the simple fact tl'3t their means are discrim-
inatory and consequently foster raCial 
inequality. How can one claim to seek 
equality through unequal means hke affir-
mative action? If two wrong do not make a 
right, and It is counter-productive to harm 
one to help another, then such IObTic ~im ply 
doe not make sense. 

King was absolutely correct 111 s2)11ng 
that people should be judged by the content 
of their character rather than the color of 
thelT skin, and such ideals represent the be t 
of what America stands for. The ideal of the 

bers of those communities arc "underrepre-
~nted" at major universities? Also of impor-
tance is d,e low retention rarc of students 
admitted under affirmative action pro!,rranlS. 
The simple fact of the matter i~ that hard 
wor" and dedication arc paramount to suc-
cess, not what self-promoting windbags like 
Jesse Jackson and AI Sharpton have to say. 

Many liberal apolobristS attempt to justi(v 
racist admission policies by citing the need for 
diversity, as if ethnicity were the only rlling 
that could ever make a tudent body diverse. 
Their argument becomes even more r Jeist, 
however, when you consider their rcasonlllg

ACTA a useless

Editor: 
I am a transfer student. 

I [owever, when 1 read that an AlI-
Campus Transfer Association was 
created by A.S. Council, I rolled Illy 
eyes in clisgust. "n,e creation of this 
ACT!\ is just another anempt by 
Associated Students to consolidate 
tI,cir power. ACTA will be packed 
with a bWlch of A.S. cronies. These 
cronies of the A.S. Council will then 
"increase repre entation and advo-
cacy for tran fer students, (read: 
"tell me what my political beliefs are 
and then fight for them on my 
behaIr), increase awareness among 
the faculty, staff and studentS, (read: 
"tcll tllem that we are freaks that 
on.ly tile Associated StudentS can 
take care ot")." 

Finally, last but certainly not 
Icast, ACTA will ... "Officially 
endorse any slate, candidate or 
party for A.S ., local, state or 
national elections, (read : "tell 
tr,lIlsfers to vote for the Green

MONDAY, JANUARY 27, 2003 THE UCSO GUARDIAN OPINION 7 

Pro: Minority enrollment is dropping Pint: Irish protestors 
employ shady tactics concin~ed from paRe 4 ronmenr. DiverSity is not an added 

bonus for;] top-notch university -
it's an essential part of creating a 
well-rounded education. 

But there\; a darker issue here 
than the disparity over utOpian cam-
puses. The University of Michigan 
law school's acceptance formula has 
people squirming because it brings 
up a difficult subject: race. 

Affirmative act.ion was created 
as a combatant to and reparation 
for raei m. It was meant to ensure 
that there would be a place for peo-
ple of all backgrounds in federal job 
openings, with the understanding 
that racism had kept minority 
applicants from getting jobs in the 
past and at the time. To imply tha t 
such measures are no longer neces-
sary because racism isn't a problem 
anymore is sheer raving madness. 

Racism is sti ll a hugc problem. 
Sure, Jim Crow laws arc gone and 
lynchings aren't a major problem. 
But that just means that racism has 
taken a new form, and it isn't as 

limited to the Deep South as wc'd 
like to think. 

Something must be wrong when 
30 percenr of white Americans 
receive college educations while 
only one-sixth of blacks have a col-
lege degree. The debate then 
becomes whether or not affirmativc 
action is a reasonable method of 
dealing with the ~inlation. 

The number of mi'1orities 
attending four-year colleges has 
risen about 85 percenr since the 
Supreme Court approved affirma-
tive action in admissions in 1978. 
Conversely, seven years after 
Proposition 209 passed, banning 
affirmative action in university 
admissions, UC Berkeley's black 
population has dropped 33 percent 
from 1996 to 200 I, and the student 
body at the University of California 
is a measly 3 percent black. 

No one is being admitted solely 
on the basis of race. People have 
argued that race has been the 
deciding factor, but they have yet 
to assess that race should bc omit-

ted entirely. Race cannot be 
ignored, especia lly in a process 
where a group of people is trying to 
discern someone 's personality. 

It is not the responsibility of the 
government to guarantee minorities 
an education. It is not the responsi-
bility of the government to end dis-
crimination. But it most assuredly is 
the responsibility of the government 
to ensure that every American be 
given the right to life, liberty and 
happiness without reference to race. 
In a perfect world, we wouJdn't have 
to worry about it. But this ituation 
is far from perfect. 

America has a long-standing his-
tory with racism, and the problem 
won't go away on its own. It is an 
injustice to simply assume that the 
responsibility is entirely on the 
underprivileged to overcome obsta-
cles when they live in a country that 
assured them that all were created 
equal. This isn't just an issue of how 
to create an ideal campus, it's about 
living up to an ideal upon which 
this country was founded.

land, no one has produced it. 
Unfortunately, the prime minis-
ter has been silent on these mat-
ters. Th us, the protesters have 
taken to the streets assuming that 
Ahern is in a conspiracy with the 
U.S. government to obtain oil 
from the toppling of Saddam

Ahern is largely ignoring the

States is labeled an emotionless, 
imperialist nation, bent on noth-
ing but oil for its own wealth. 
Suddenly we are threatening war 
because we are full of hate? The 
leftist inconsistency knows no 
bounds in this country. 

Regardless of the protesters' 
rants, the blame is squarely the 
Taoiseach's. His party, Fianna Fal, 

protesters seem to 
be as mindless as 
ever. Many at 
Shannon airport 
have taken to

along, using them 
as shields against

they attempt to 
arrest unruly pro-
testers. One orga-

control of the 
government and .

party, Fianna

outcry. Once

Bush. 

tration decides 
how to face up to its silence, the 
protesting will become merely an 
anti-war rally ag.lln . 
Unfortunately, becau e Fianna

that dl\'ersity is more important than

It docs not take a constinltional 
scholar to understand that the 14th

remember that its equal protection

Democrats cannot argue the logic 
of affirmative action, so they resort 
to name-calling and bU7.z words. 
Senate Minority Leader Tom 
Daschle said, "Once again today, 
the administration has shown as 
clearly by their actions as anyone 
can, that they will continue to side 
with those opposed to civil rights 
and oppo ed to diversity in thi 
country." Does he explain how or 
why opposing affirmative action 
makes one anti-civil rights or anti-
diversity' Of course not, that would 
require the application of logic and 
Daschle isn't up to the task. 

Dr. King did have a dream, and 
a good dream it was. Fortunately, 
society has witnessed so much of its 
realization, since so few people 
today ascribe to the racism of the 
past, but instead embrace people of

equal. While there arc ohviously

Israel: Photographer shares' 1 ,000 faces' 
cominued from fJal:e I 

Sorger said. 
In response to the defacing of 

tudent for Justice posters during 
Israeli-Palestinian week, Sorger 
emphasized (he need for peace on 
campus. 

"Our goal is peace in Israel, and 
we would love to have peaceful 
relations on campus with the 
groups thai are generally against 
Israel ," orger said. 

The "Got Israel ?" booth fea-
tured large signs on which facts 
ranging from "Israel has two offi-
ciallanguages: Hebrew and Arabic" 
to "The test for syphilis was invent-
ed by an Israeli" were printed for 
passersby to read on their way to 
morning classes. 

One observer, Eleanor 
Roosevelt College junior Ty Kruck, 
said she felt that the display was 
informative. 

"It makes me think that I need 
to stop being apathetic, especially 
now there's a need to really open up 
to different cultures and listen to all 
sides of a story before judging," 
Kruck said. 

Other signs informed of numer-
ous inventions made by Israelis, 
including the invention oflCQ, the 
Internet program that made instant 
messaging possible. One sign fea-
tured a blown-up picture of actress 

atalie Portman with the caption, 
"Born in Israel." 

"It's really ea y for anyone 
who's not there [in Israel] to see 
the news and look at it like it's just 
a piece of land," said event orga-
nizer etta Retter, a Roosevelt 
college sophomore. "We want to 
present a more cultural side of 
Israel, and to connect to people on 
a human level. " 

he and co-organizer Eddie 
Cohen, 31 0 a Roosevelt college 
sophomore, planned the event 
after attending an Israeli 

dvocacy MISSion conference last 
ycar. 

The UC D evcnt also includcd 
a hoo~h bar and sales of I lebrew-

Diana Kwo'r./Goord;"n 

Libr..y tile ERe sophomore and event organizer Netta Retter called the day an 
attempt to 'connect to people on a human ieler by presenting cultural aspects of Israel. 

Stanton's presentation, which 
took place at 2 p.llI. in the Davis 
and Riverside room in the Price 
Center, narrated a slide show of the 
international photojournalists pic-
tures of Israel's natural landscapes, 
cities and faces. 

The first presentation show-
cased landscapes ranging from the 
desert to snow-covered hills. The 
following series depicted images of 
large ad billboards, night lights and 
crowded outdoor cafes, among 
other scenes. 

"Tel Aviv is the city of free-
dom," tamon aid. "I rael is a 
country where you can drive JUSt 
an hour from a gay bar in Tel Aviv 
to a trict orthodox Clry near 
Jerusalem." 

While narrating the third eg-
ment, which included faces of young 
and old, rabbis and drag queens, 
Stanton described the dlffcrent seg-
ments of Israeli society and the 
problems its constitucnts face , 
including mass immigration to Tel 
Aviv. 

"If ew York is like a mclting 
POt, Tel Aviv is like a mosaic," 

tanton said. 
Accordll1g to Stanton, there are 

,0 many Russian spea kers that signs 

in the window shops of real cstate 
agencies, for example, will be writ-
ten in Hebrew, ·English and 
Russian. 

There is also a large group of 
Ethiopian immigrants, who, 
according to Stanton, are as dis-
criminated in lsrael as they were in 
their homeland. 

"They were sure thcy were 
coming to the land of milk and 
honey," Stanton said." ow, h w-
ever, the new generation is 
ashamed - they don't feel 
Ethiopian or Israeli, so instead 
they identify with American rap-
pers." 

The "big melting pot" of 
Israel, according to tamon, IS thc 
country 's mandatory two-year 
military program, which bnngs all 
ethnicities togethcr In mandatory 
service. 

tanton went on to show pho-
tographs in his field of e<pcrllse ' 
religious ceremonies. He showed 
images of )eru alem's Wailing \ Vall , 
where children, old men in onh -
dox dress and police officers alike 
gathered in prayer.

Changes: Wording causes confusion over policy application 
conrinued from page 2 

was warranted, but that he was 
urging "implementing these 
Ichangcs] and moving on ." 

Brown said thai while she does 
not know whether their COIll-
ments will be taken into consider-
ation in the second round of revi -
SlIlIl, she hopes changes will be 
made so that docllment is not 
open to interpretation by the 
adllli nistra tion. 

"Discrepancies in wording' 
always favor the administration," 
Brown said. " \Vc're thinking 
worse-casc-sccnario . . . \ Ve have to 
think of possible applications of 
thc\c policies in the future ." 

One of the concerns voiced by 
Ihe A.S. Council was with student 
governmcnt's righls to advocacy. 
I ew ,ections dealing with the 
'ponsorshlp of speakers require 
topics and speakers sponsored by 
snldent governments to be "bal-
anced over time," and, if a studcnt 
govcrnment sponsors a forum 
"advocating for or against a non-
student government candidatc or 
ballot proposition," thcy are 
required to invite a reprcsentative 
of the opposing "campaign or 
campaigns" at the same time. 

Brown said that it WOlS unclear 
whether this might force the A.S. 

Council to invite speakers from 
cvery existing political party, for 
example, when inviting speakcrs to 
campus. In its written comments 
to UCOP, the A.S. Council went 
on to criticize use of the tcrm 
"nemral" in reference to spcaker~, 
asking " \Vho defines who is neu-
tral?" and stating, "We should not 
be forced to bring 1'1 peopl e out-
side of ~tIIdent g'overnlllent's 

choo~ing, simply because therc 
eX ists somewherc some 0ppO\i-
tion. " 

Brown also offered the example 
of the A.s . Counci l's currcnt work 
on a "No on CRENO" c:llnp.lig'n, 
fo r which it is attempting to raise 
upwards of $15,000 from colleg'e 
counci ls and from private 
flmdLlislIlg. Brown ,;Iid her con-
cern was that the I\.S. Council 
might be forccd to rai se an addi-
tional $15 ,000 on a "Yes on 

RE 0" campaign to comply 
with new revisions concerning stu-
dent government's allocatioll of 
funds . 

\"'atson said that he did not 
interpret the proposed new poli-
cies to require such a scenario. 

Another concern was with the 
detimtion and cOllStituency of a 
student government, and for 
whom it can or cannot lobby. The 

Why persist in a 
necessary evil long 

after the necessity has 
ceased to exist? 

Why perpetuate a 
cycle of breeding-
caging-killing? 

revised document states that the 
advocacy of student governments, 
in the case of public policy issues, 
llluSt resolve positions on issucs 
"affecting students in their Stanis 
as students. " 

The A.5. Council asked 
whether or not diSCrimination 
bascd on race or gender figu red 
I nto the stude nt 's "s tatus," o r 
whcthcr student ; tatllS wa; limited 
to "academIC bodies in cla~s­
rooms. " 

The A.S. Council also opposed 
Ihe new secti ons of the POitCICS 
Ihal banned recogni zed ca milli> 
o rganizations from partl cipalion 
in refercndum which determine 
whcther campus-bascd student 
fees Will be raised, as voted uy stu-
dents. Brown wants these sections 
deleted. 

Watson sa id that he believed 
that the revisions had tcmmed 
from several problems, in luding 
past endorsement of candidates 
from unnamed student govern-
ments and from a need to clarify 
in what situations srudent fees 
could be used . According to 
Watson , several campus adminis-
tration, including tho e at 
UCSD, have been vigorously 
opposed to these mandatory fees 
being applied to external orgalll-

zarion . 
"Among the baSIC rea~ons is 

that the mandatory fee is a 
requ irement for enrollment, so if a 
student objects to that fcc, we 
would then be obligated not to 
enroll that studen't," Watson said. 
"And I don 't sec how we could do 
that." 

Both old and new ver~ion., of 
the pulit.:y incorporate form, of 
~afeguards for ~tudcnts disagree-
Ing with the applic'lllOI1 of srudcnt 

fee~ to receIve refund,. 
According to Brown, \ "Jtson 

has prollllscd that.1 COllllllittee will 
furm for the second round of revi-
sions. 

I,,\'a tson sa id that tn the future, 
administrators Will formall\' ,15k 
for the comments of thc' A.s. 

ouncil and the (,SA. 
"It has often been deSCribed 

that making law is like makIng 
sausages. You don't want to see the 
process," Watson said. " I don't 
think makIng univerSity policy is 
as bad as that, but one has to rec-
ognize that it IS not a perfect 
process ... Let's move fo rward , 
particularl y when thiS is real 
progress." 

Official UC D cam pus com-
ments on the pollcle Will be sent 
to UCOP by the Feb. 3 deaditne.

THE U SD GUARDI~ - - MONDAY. JANUARY 27. 2003

Thomas 
Neeley 

Homeland Security done 
Super Bowl style 

Qualcomm Stadium security rivals 
that of the Pentagon 

Experience has showll me that 
working for the Gu{/rdia/1 has many 
perb, such as opportunities to 
report on somethmg larger than 

CSD - namely, the Super Bowl 
taking placc in San Diego. 

AI though I was not offered an 
unlimited-access press pass for 
gamc day, 1 did end up with thc 
next best thing: a one-day pass to 
attend a Jan. 2~ press conference 
featuring most of the pre- and 
post-game performer: Santana, 
,\1i chelle Branch. Beyonce owles, 
DIXIe hicks, Janet Ma>.'Well, Styx 
and Bon Jovi. The arional 
F otball League public relations 
people arranged with my editor to 
send one photographer and one 
writer. me. 

Attending a real press confer-
ence with MT - ized stars adds a 
certam degree of excitement' to 
my normal Friday off. 1 really 
only needed to interview Janet 
Maxwell, who was performing a 
sign-language interpretation of 
the national anthem while the 
Dixie ChiCks performed the vocal 
version. 

I arrived at Qualcomm tadium 
just about on time for the midday 
press conference and easily found 
parking In the asphalt plains 
around the stadium. 

Since 1 was supposedly on the 
IiH and wa told 1 only needed a 
photo I D, I went (brecdy to the 
media entrance at G,1[C D and was 
qUickly mrncd away after ;uspi-
cious crutlny of my de facto pres 
credentials (lilY sn.dcIH ID and a 
recent copy of the GU/Jrdllm). A 
,enes of frantic cell phone calls 
hack and forth to my NFL contact 
and ~ - mmutc afte~ the press con-
ference had started, 1 remained 
outside the ecurity penmeter. 
Pauence and a proml>e from my 
contact to work clllngs out made 
me'tav. 

\ \!hlle 1 waited, two men bear-
109 ntles approached the gate and 
tried to pass the ecum}' guard. 
One was dressed 111 a Ci'"11 \Var-era 
Uniform and the other dre,sed as a 
\ "orld War I doughboy. 

[ felt bener, ;eelng that despi te 
their show of force, the ,ecunty 
gua rd turned them away as "ell . I 
thought, hy comparison, that with 
Illy pcn , reporter's notebook and 
tJpe recorder, [ looked like the less-
er thrcat. 

I ran and caught up With the 
Union soitlier, who told IIlC his 

" When an American sees 
a poUce officer he thinks 

there wiU be trouble; 
when a European sees 

one, he knows there will 
be " not any. 

name was Ken \i alkcr. I Ie was a 
member of the Sons of Union 
Veterans and wuuld be a part of the 
pre-ga me show. I asked .f he was 
nlrned awav from Gate D because 
of his ntle.· 

"Oh no," he said. "They're not 
worried about the guns." 

He aid they did nO! have prop-
er credential either. 

As I remrned to ,ate D to wait, 
I recalled this past summer, which I 
spent In Washington, D.C. I 
interned about even blocks north-
east uf the Capiro!. 

Over the course of the summer, 
I made many tripS to the Library of 
Congress building" which arc 
located behind the CdS tern face of 
the apltol and next to the 
Supreme Court. ' [0 make the trip 
shoner, I would cu t acro>s the 
property on which the Capitol ItS. 

\Vallang past the concrete barn-
ers that now block all road acce s 
Into the Capltol's grounds, I W,I 
surpnsed at how acee Sible the 
property wa for pedestrians, even 
nght up the ;,teps of the huilding. 
Capitol Police ,~ere cVCf)'where, 
but subtle and nO! re,lddy Visible 
once II1slde the perttncter. For a 
period dunng the SUlllmer, a man 
WJS able to set lip along With ,Intl-
abortion posten a hfe-slzed man-
nequlll o(jesu,> on the eastern su:p 
of the buildlllg. It wa pretty popu-
lar With children. 

From what [ read In D.C. tOur 

books pnnted before C)J II , puhlic 
access. once inside the Capitol, was 
virtually unlllllltcd . One book 
encouraged "isitor, to break :I\\'a)' 
from the guided tour and wander 
the halls since it was "the peoplc'~ 
hou;,e." ' lours roda\' through the 

apitol are shortc~ ,lI1d '~lSl!(m 
must stay with their tour b'roup~. 

The differences 1 Wish to lIIake 
between the securi ty IIlC.lsure, 
raken for the Super Bowl this year, 
compared with tho!>e vi"hlc 
around ule Ca pitul - a hullding 
that was the 9/1 1 hi"lckcrs' fourth 
target - was my feeling of vulner-
;lbility. 

/-laving to wlild my wa), through 
checkpoint after checkpoint, being 
worried about the validity of Illy 
credenuals and scrutinizing securi-
ty everywhere, make me feel 1Il0rc 
in ecure than an apparent absence 
of security. 

Europeans are shallleless when 
it comes to security. \ "hen I ,'isitcd 

pain and France for the first (Il1le 
in 1999, I remember seei ng guards 
armcd with submachine guns 
standing outside government 
buildings and in tralll !>lations. 
That never II sed to happen III 
America. My dad once character-
ized the difference for lIle: \\'hen 
an American sees a police officer, 
he thinks there will bc trouble; 
when a European sees Olle, he 
knows there will nO! be anI'. 

\Vhy were Cahforni;n; out-
raged when Gov. Gray 0.1\'1., 
announced In the early 11l0ntlh 
after 9/11 that there wd .. a thre,1t 
posed to the state' bndges' \,Ver<: 
we really angry bccJuse the gmer-
nor leaked the III for III a tllln , or wa ..

horoscope ARINA 
What political issue do you feel stongly about? 

By UNDA C. BLACK 
Tribune Media Services 

Aries (March 2 I-April 19) -
The more you learn, the more you 
realize you don't know. Don't be 
ashamed; it's just a phase of the 
Journey toward wi dam. You're 
getting there. 

Taurus (April 20-May 20) - If 
you can't get a raise, maybe you can 
improve your benefits. It's worth a 
try, and it's worth making a few 
phone ca ll . You're very per uasive 
now. 

Gemini (May 21-)une 21) -
How can a charming conversation-
al i t like yourself become awkward 
and tongue-tied? Don't sweat It. 
Let the other do the ta lking, and 
they'll think you 're brilliant. 

Cancer Oune 22-)uly 22) -
You're enormously creative now. 
You have to be, or you'd be totally 
inundated. Learn to delegate, and 
you'll be headed for your next mil-
lion. 

Leo Ouly 23-Aug. 22) - Be 
careful , vour idealism is about to 
carry yo~ away. New changes seem 
perfect, but are they practical ? 
Keep a lid on expenditures. 

Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22) - It 
may eem as if you never have 
enough time anymore. Loved ones 
understand, so keep at a tough job 
till you get it done. 

Libra (Sept. 23-0ct. 22) - You 
can learn whatever you don't know. 
You may not know it all, but know-
ing you, you know more than they 
think you do. 

Scorpio (Oct. 23- ov. 21) -
Look for ways to in rease your 
income wi thout increa ing your 
output. Amazingly, that becomes 
possible over the next few days. 

Sagittarius ov. 22-Dec. 21) 
- Your ability to communicate is 
still lagging behind the awesome 
insights you're receiving. This is 
OK - you'll be called to teach 
soon enough. Take notes if you 
must. 

Capricorn (Dec. 22-)30. 19)-
. Your mind may be racing a mile a 
minute. Don't ask your body to 
keep up. Hide away in a private 
place for some serious contempla-
tion. You may discover that you 
want to change direction. 

Aquarius Gan. 20-Feb. 18) -
You're an excellent team player, 
and with good reason. You get 
much farther and faster that way. 
Call a meeting and oudmc new 
plans. 

Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20) -
Some of the order you receive 
may not make much sense, but they 
do make sen e from 3 bigger per-
spective. Trust an hone t, WI e 
leader, and you'll get to the TIght 
place.

I. SPORTS 

Volleyball: Tritons have 
minor mistakes to work out 

contmued from page 20 
aSSiStS, and Keyser, who had five 
assists and a 5010. 

Keyser, who attacked an incred-
I ble. 9 for the match, noted hi 
team's satisfaction with their per-
formance against a tough team, bur 
also the need to fix some minor 
problems. 

"I felt !Ike we played hard and 
made a lot of little ml take, but for 
the most parr, the effort was there," 
he said. "'vVe're all happy with what 
happened." 

The ne.\.'( night, UC D faced no 
less of a task when it traveled to 
Pauley Pavilion to take on the 
VCLA Bruins. Facing imilarly low 
expectation as the night before, 
VCSD once again managed to take a 
game on the road before falling 3-1. 

The first game opened very 
tight when VCSD out-hit the 
Bruins .371 to .341, but CLA 
squea ked out a 30-28 victory. The 
Tritons could have folded after they 
callle up cmpty in the first game, 
but they kept fighting. The Bnllns 
took game two 30-14, but Vc. D 
managcd an IInpresslve 30-2 "-

tory in game three, despite UCLNs 
.432 attacking percentage. The 
Bruins closed out the mat h in 
game four, when the o. 3 tealll in 
the nation held off a Triton charge 
for a narrow 31-29 \\~n . 

UC D wa out-blocked 12. - to 
7 and out-hit .397 to .3 14, but was 
not outplayed. Chris A lortimer led 
the Tritons on defense with 13 digs, 
and crrer Perrine guided the 
offense with 62 assists, leaving four 
Tritons with double-digit kill tal-
lies, led by Waller with 20. 

Perrine has added to the team's 
stability and fellow senior Mortimer 
has noticed the increased evenness 
,vith which his team is pla}~ng. 

"\ Ve played really well as a 
team," he said. "\Ve were able to 
maintain good inten ity in key parts 
of matches when we needed to. We 
didn't get too down on ourselves 
when ,,~e got behind." 

The Triton return to actioll on 
Ian. 29 when they take on non-con-

San Diego shines as host 
NFL threatens city that is best fit for Super Bowl 

By JOSH CROUSE 
Senior Staff Write r 

ationa l Football League 
Commissioner Paul T.1gliabue has 
somehow managed to leapfrog 
MLB's own Bud Selig a the worst 
commissioner in sports. The title 
that once unquestionably 
belonged to elig was recently 
transferred to Tags when he once 
again overstepped his bounds as 
the commissioner. 

Tags just came out ,vith a threat 
to the city of San Diego that 
unless it builds a new foo tball sta-
dium, it has no chance of getting 
another Super Bowl. 

"I'm surprised we're here this 
week," Tags was quoted as sa0ng 
at a Super Bowl press conference. 

So basically, the big boss is 
threatening the city on behalf of 
perclU1ial jerk Alex Spanos, who 
ha been trying to get the city to 
split the COSt of a new $400 million 
stadium. To say that thi threat has 
any other legitimate ba is is patent-
ly absurd. I have a news flash for all 
of you who think that Quaicornm 
(apologies to Jack Murphy) is a 
truly outdated stadium not fit for 
the big game: The NFL would not 
corne to this city tWO of the last five 
years - and three of the last 15 -
if the stadium were nor a fitting 
host for the Super Bowl. 

Perhaps the old Jack Murphy 
Stadium was not a fitting home for 
a Super Bowl. I am willing to 
admit that. However, after the $7 
million 1997 expansIOn pnor to 
the Big Dance in 1998, the FL 
had no complaints about San 
Diego's stadium. In fact, it thought 
so highly of the improvements 
that It brought the Super Bowl 
back to San Diego this year, some-
thll1g not often done in the, FL. 

The que rion has to be asked : 
\,\Ihat IS this city lacking) vVe have 
the besr late-January weather in 
the country, plenty of hotel space, 

COMMENTARY 

" The NFL would not 
come to this city two of 

the last five years - and 
three of the last 15 - if 
the stadium were not a 

fitting host far the Super 
Bowl." 

the best natural backdrop around 
and plenty of stuff to do. n rop of 
that, the city of San Diego offers 3 
truly historic stadium that is not 
outdated, ha namral grass, an 
open stadium and not a bad seat in 
the hou e (l've personally sat in 
the top row of the stadium and had 
a blast watching the Chargers). 

This is a lor more than can be 
said for the next three upcr Bowl 
sites. Houston, next year's ite, is a 
domed stadium without real grass. 
The oil fields of Texas cannot com-
pare to the beache of an Diego. 
The weather also leaves something 
to be desired when compared to 
the beautiful San Diego climate. 

Weather is something that 
Jacksonvi lle, the fo ll owing super 
si te, does have the weather, but the 
buck stops the re. J acksonvi lle 
hardly provides the backdrop that 

an Diego does. O n top of that, 
there is not cnough hotel space in 
J acksonvi lle, so the FL is plan-
ning on renti ng out cruise sh ips to 
serve as fl oating hotels for t11 e 
game. And then there's Detroit, 
the site of Super Bowl XL. W hat 
can you say about Detroi t? It has a 
bad footba ll team and would be a 
horrible place to have a Super 
Bowl. It might have been OK back 
when Barry Sanders sti ll had 
Detroitians interested in football, 
but I'd be surprised if the city 
could fi ll half of the seats for the 
40th anniversary of the Super 
Bowl. And then, for life during the 
week leading up to the uper Bowl, 
what are people supposed to do, 
walk around and try nor to get 
mugged' 

When you look at thc simalioll 
logically, it's clear that lags is sim-
ply trying to help onc of his own-
er get a new stadium . The new 
stadium would increase re"cnuc 
for the team, which would in mrn 
increase revenue for the NFL. 
That's something that Tags wOlllci 
like. What the citizens of an 
Diego should do i re ognizc this 
as the baseless threat that it i~ and 
not cave in. jack M urphy Stadium 
- err, Qualcornl11 - is a great 
football stadium. It will continue 
to be so. There is no need for a 
new smdium at this timc. few 
renovations, sure, but definitely 
not a new stadium. 

I, ~ r one, can't wait for five 
ye.1rs clown the road when Tags 
realizes that thcre isn't a sitc in 
Amcnca better fi tti ng for the 

uper Bowl than Sal1 Diego. On 
that day, I W:lI1t to sec him crawl 
back to an Diego on his h:lI1ds 
and knees, begging for us to take 
him back. Oh, what a si te It will bc.

SPRING SPORT PREVIEW 

UCSD golf ready to tee off 
Team combines youth and veteran leadership 

By JON MILES 
Contributing Write r 

The U SD men's golf team 
is getting ready to kick off its 
pring season, and it ha a lot of 

hope for thi~ year. The team fin-
ished fifth last year in the eight-
tealll California Coll egiate 
Athletic Association 
Championship Tournamcnt and 

i~ luoking to improve on that fin-
ish this year. 

·' \·Ve expect to have a lot of 
SUCl:CSS," said Triton head coach 
.\1ikc Wydra, who is entenng his 
20th sea~on as UCSD's coach. 

The teum already played in 
three tournaments this fall, 
including a seventll-place finish at 
the 13 -team Division 1I ational 
Preview in unriver, Ore. T hc 
' n'itons' best showing of the fall 
was at the Elco Invita lional in 
Bakersfield, Calif., where VCS)) 
iunior Jan Godoski shot a 67 and 
finished tied for third in the tour-
numenr, JUSt two shots off the 
leader. 

The team i led by senior c.lp-
tJin Blake Schneider. Wydra also 
expects key contributions from 
Golloski, junior Alan Scheer, 

freshmen Robbie Kramer and Ryo 
Yamada . 

"Ryo has played very wcll," 
Wydra said. 

Scheer fin ished 2 1st at 
Bakersfield and six th at the 
DiviSion II atlonal Preview. I Ie 
also had the team 's best finish in 
its 1:lst fall tournament, the 
Prcstige at PGA West in 

ovember in La Quinta, Calif. 
Kramer fini shed tied for 17th Jt 
(he National Preview and sccond 
among VCSD golfers in all three 
tourn.IIIlCnts. Yamada finished no 
lower than fourth among Triton 
playcrs in all of the fall tourna-
ments, including a 28th place fin-
ish overall at thc tournament in 
Bakersfield . 

Wydra points Out that making 
the VCSD £,011' team was extreme-
ly difficult this year. The players 
had to qualify in a four-round 
tournament in the fall to make the 
team . 

"Some good players didn't 
make it," Wydra said. 

The final roster includes II 
players and four redshirt fresh-
men. The team i loaded with tal-
ent and excited about making a 
strong run in the CCAA. 

For the most part, thc Tritons 
wi ll not trave l extensively this sea-
son, sta0ng mainly in Southern 
California. T hey have tOurna-
ments in Bakersfield and Davis, 
Calif., in the coming weeks and a 
tournament in Del Mar on March 
10 and March II. 

The first tournament of the 
new season will take place Feb. 
24 and Feb. 25 at the Family 
10tors InvitatIOnal at Seven 

Oaks Country Club in 
Bakersfield . 

The CCAA Conference 
Tournament is April 21 and 
April 22 in Patterson, Calif. A 
good showing there is impor-
tanr, but it will be extrcmely dif-
ficult as C U Bakersfield and 
VC Davis, both in the same con-
ference as VCSD, appeared in 
the national championship last 
spring. 

That said, with the veteran 
leadership of Wydra and thc 
young talent on the roster 
(Schneider is the only senior), 
the Triton hope to play well in 
the conference and completes 
their season in Sunriver at the 
Division II atlonal 
Champion hips in May.
