Ed Butler drinks "Mountain 
Red Wine" with students .. . 

Ed Butler served as San Diego's city 
attorney for five years, from 1964 to 
1969. He has been a successful 
attorney, as weU as a successful 
businessman; he is the vice president 
and manager of Electro Instruments, 
Inc. Using his knowledge of business 
economics and the San Diego city legal 
system, Butler plans to run the city as 
a business without the waste found 
within " super agencies" that have a 
multitude of bureaucrats. Ed Butler 
led the drive to preserve the Torrey 
Pines. Governor Reagan appointed 
him to serve on the Commission on 
Home Rule. The attorney general 
appointed him to serve on the 
Commission on Obscenity, and the 
President of the University of 
California, Charles Hitch, appointed 
him to the Commission on the Isla 
Vista Riots. 

The following questions were 
answered by Butler in his press 
conference. 

(1) "What do you consider to be the 
'major ' issue in this election?" 

(Butler didn 't address himself to any 
one main issue, though he did address 
himself to the problem of urban 
sprawl,) Butler : "Most of us who are 
concerned about urban sprawl see 
these subdivisions booming out (75 
quare miles of land to the north of San 

Diego ), until there is a blanket of 
single - family residences and parking 
lots and streets and parks and it just 
looks like Los Angeles alJd Orange 
County. The shape of your future . And 
that's bad. The city doesn't own the 75 
square miles : private individuals own 
it... so they're concerned really about 
how much 'dough ' they can make on 
this thing. 

"The answer to thi s i that they can 
introduce an ethic into their corpOrate 
decision - making proceeds that takes 
the environment and ecology,. into 
account. That when private 
enterprisers and ~velopers saw the 
impacl of development on the ecology. 
that they have a social obligation to the 
community at large to ay . 'Hey, that's 
a lousv deal !' And they should fall back 
and group and reorganize lhe plan and 
the plot and th subdivision to take that 
thing into account. " 

(2) "Do you feel that police/student 
relationships are atisfactory in an 
Diego?" 

'Top' People into Community 
Ed Butler . .. No thev aren't 

sati factor~' ! A mayor the first thing 
I'd do is get the Chief of pol ice out of 
tbe city hall . He has an office right 
next to the city ma.nager and he is a 
department head. He is nine floors off 
the ground : nine floors away from the 
peopl . I'd g t him out of that office 
and I'd get him back in the field with 
the police officers. And I'd have the top 
and enior guys of that department out 

Chuck Rose 

in the community talking and looking 
and listening and getting the inputs. 

"They've been in an ivory tower for a 
long time and I think that we need the 
top people in the department to be in 
that community and to get those inputs 
and to see what's really happening out 
there, because they are good guys. 
They really are. They're honest, 
sincere ; they are motivated. They 
want to be good officers. They want to 
do a good job for the city. But they've 
got this terrible problem about if they 
go down into the community they 're 
fearful that they 'll lose that prestige 
and that authority when they begin to 
'rap' with people." 

(3) " What stand do you take on the 
latest move by the State Legislature to 
ban hitch-hiking in California?" 

Ed Butler : " I really think without 
being terribly serious about it that we 
ought to have a law compelling people 
to pick-up hitchhikers. It would be the 
greatest answer to the transportation 
problem there ever was! Here I ' tool' 
down the street in 6,000 pounds of 
metal that could carry five guys, and 
I'm afraid to pick you up because of so 
many of the rapes , the robberies, the 
murders and other things. But that 
would be a great solution to the urban 
transportation problem, if people who 
had cars felt safe in stopping and 
picking up people who needed a ride. 
But we're scared ..... " 

On Collelte Housing Problems 

(4) " As mayor, what would you do to 
help relieve some of the housing 
problems that confront a great number 
of local college students, such as high 
rents and poorly maintained housing in 
Pacific Beach, Ocean Beach and 
Mission Beach?" 

Ed Butler : " I don 't know that a 
mayor could do very much about fixing 
rents. By California law, the cities 
have this big problem about fixing 
rents. I think the mayor could get a 
hold of the city attorney's office to 
receive complaints about landlord 
gouging (the refusal of landlords to 
return cleaning deposits, etc ... ). What 
you need is a bridge between the 
mayor 's office and yourselves. You 
don 't really know this maze of city hall 
and the bureaucracy down there. By 
this mayor's council for youth you 
would become informed about the 
different remedies you have about 
stuff like this; you could go to the 
agency in the city. We'd ha e one or 
two staff people working fulltime for 
this council in the city. and they could 
receive the e reports and complaints 
and then run it to the right bureau -
like legal aid . to bring action." 

"Wouldn 't that add up to just more 
red tape?" 

.. It might. but you 've got to institu-
tionalize these thing ." 

Ed Butler started off his press 
conferenc~ by announcing his plan for 
a "Mayor Council for Youth ." He 
ummarized it in the following 

manner : 
" We called thi s press conference. 

not for youth. but for the citizens of San 
Diego .. to tell you about the Mayor's 
Council for Youth. which when I'm 
elected we're going to immediately put 
into effect. It will cut across a 
spectrum of San Diego schools and San 
Diego communities. and it's going to 
be a council of vouth that will be 
available to advise me and the city 
admini tration concerning the impact 
of the programs and policies of the 
city upon the youth of San Diego. which 
for too long has been neglected. and for 
too long has not been involved. 
c rtainly in local politics." 

Ed Butler is a graduate of Gorge 
Wa hington University and Harvard 
Law School.

Pete Wilson likes to pick up 
hitchhikers who are students .. . 
~ ............................................. ,ChuckRo5e 

Pete Wilson is a 38-year-old San 
Diegan who has served as an 
assemblyman to the State Legislature, 
where he has accumulated what his 
supporters claim is an outstanding 
record. He was requested by President 
Nixon to serve on the nation's 15-
member Advisory Committee on 
Environmental Quality, and is the 
recipient of the " Audub on 
Conservation Award," presented by 
the national Audubon Society" in 
recogn i ti on of outsta ndin g 
achievement in the conservation of our 
national resources." 

Wilson has authored " no-bust" 
legislation that requires "police with 
authority to release from custody and 
deliver to treatment, persons under the 
influence of drugs, found while on 
route to treatment, with provision that 
the record shows Detention rather than 
Arrest. " Wilson has also authored bill 
in planning and land use that require 
sub-dividers to provide space for 
schools. He has also written legislation 
dealing with landlord - tenant law 
reform and an another bill requiring 
merchants who advertise in Spanish to 
provide Spanish language contracts. 

The following questions were 
answered by Pete Wilson in his press 
conference: 

(1) "What do you consider to be the 
major issue in this election?" 

Pete Wilson : " The number one issue 
is growth and how do we control it. And 
specifically, the necessity at this time 
to actually impo e controls on 
development. San Diego is really at a 
crossroads. In the past the city has 
annexed great areas of land with the 
intention of developing them. But if we 
actually control the development, 
those annexations wi11 turn out to b 
very beneficial becau e they will be a 
buffer and provide orne 'open' pace ' 
(recreational areas) so that we don't 
just become another extension of 
Orange County, which i a distinct 
possibility. And that to me is really the 
challenge of the next four year ." 

New Chief a Good One! 
(2) "Do you feel that police/student 

relation hips are satisfactory in San 
Diego?" 

Pete Wilson: " Oh, I don 't know that 
they're ever satisfactory : they're 
never all that you want them to be. But 
I will say thi . the new chief here i nol 
only a good police officer and one who 
came up through the ranks and has 
earned the respect of all of his men. 
but he is in addition to being smart and 
tough. smart in another way. He i 
sen itive to the nece ity to improve 
relations.... Since he ha come in I 
have no led all kind of innovations. 

They actually tell the people on a 
beat ca r: 'We want you to pend at 
least an hour today getting out of the 
car and going into the area that you 
serve - like go into a hopping center 
and meet all the people that you erve. 
Tell them that you're there to help.' 

Editors Note : 

They are really making an effor t 
so .... There is no need at all for them to 
ever be abusive or discourteous." 

(3) "What stand do you take on the 
latest move by the state legislature to 
ban hitch - hiking in California? " 

Pete Wilson : .. Hitch - hiking i an 
economic necessity for a lot of young 
people, and I've done a lot of it my elf 
and given a lot of rides. But it does 
scare me to death when I realize that 
there are sick people out and literally 
just cruising along trying to pick up 
people like the young O'Connor girl. 
Maybe men don't have to worry about 
it so much. I'm not particularly 
concerned, because they can take care 
of themselves, but I do worry about 
girl hitch - hiker . I'm not so sure that 
an officer coming along and suggesting 
to them that it is a bad idea is going to 
make a whole lot of difference. I don 't 
know wha t the answer is .... "

help relieve some of the housing 
problems that confront a great number 
of local college tudents . uch as high 
rents and poorly maintained hou ;np in

Pete Wil on : "There i a tandard.

they're offering. There is a standard in 
the law a to the condition of the

TA's organize AFT locql 
An organizational meeting of the UCSD Research and 

Teaching Assistants' Local has been called for tonight at 5 p.m. 
in the Revelle Informal Lounge. The meeting has been called 
due to feelings among TA's and RA's as expressed in a recent 
questionnaire which cited the need for such an organization. 

The claim of the organization is that both working and 
unemployed graduate students have no control over 
employment practices at UCSD or over their "specific working 
situation". As a result of this lack of control , teaching 
assistants and research assistants have had to endure poor 
working conditions which make effective teaching and 
research difficult. 

Some of the compla ints cited by the organization include the 
following facts : The inflation rate in San Diego is rapidly 
rising. yet TA salaries have remained constant ; although 
undergraduate population has increased by nearly 50 per cent, 
the number of FTE TA 's has increased by only 24 per cent from 
1969 to 1972, resulling in overcrowded sections and elimination 
of positions; little attention is given to matching the TA to his 
assignment in terms of his interests and qualifications and 
sometimes the TA does not receive his assignment until so far 
into the quarter that he cannot be well prepared for it. 

Since individual protests concerning these and other 
employment-related problems have generally been futile . 
it ha been proposed to establisit a local of the American 
Federation of Teachers which would include employed TA 's 
and RAÂ·s.

(areer plann ing plans careers 
The Career Education Planning Services is continuing its 

series of informal "rap" sessions. getting together students 
with similar interests for the purpose of discussing career 
opportunities in their fields. 

In addition. the "Outreach" program of the department is 
about to go into effect as well. This is based upon the results of 
the CAREER/ VOCATIO AL INTEREST CARDS which were 
filled out by 4005 undergraduate students this ye~r (an increase 
of over 1000 students from last year. demonstrating the greater 
concern with economics and career planning). On the basis of 
the compiled results of the individual interests. CEPS will be 
able to reach out to students and provide them with 
information within th eir specialized areas. 

The breakdown shows the broad spectrum of interest here at 
UCSD: pre med 1042 interested students ; pre dental 205 ; other

Reagan cuts U( Libraries' funds 
Library hours have been drastically 

reduced this year at 311 UC campuses 
because of a $ 75 million budget cut. 
Despite this cut, UCSD librarian 
Melvin Voigt says he will attempt to 
keep library operations as close as 
possible to last year 's level. 

In addition, Voigt will continue with 
plans to open the Art-Music 
department of the Central library by 
early December. The present library 
system is being expanded at the rate of 
100.000 volum"s a year although it only 
has the staff to process 70,000. The 
UCSD libraries have never reached 
their full projected staffing capacity 
since the Centra l Library only opened 
last fall . 

With the scheduled opening of the 
new units. it became apparenl that 
more staff would be needed. To meet 
this increase in staffing needs teamed 
with the lack of available resources, 

Voigt had to redirect some of the 
money designated for other funds into 
reference - circula tion. Last year, the 
preSident's office supplied the library 
with $40,000 lomeet the financial needs 
of the University library expansion 
plans. This money will no longer be 

available, leaving the library with an 
even larger discrepancy between this 
year's and last year 's funds . 

" We are still trying to obtain more 
funds," said Voigt. "Besides replacing 
the money being diverted now. we need 
$25 ,000 to go back to last year 's level. " 

Governor Reagan did not take all of 
these factors into account when he 
criticized the UC libraries for 
decreasing hours although the staffing 
money itself was not reduced, 
according to Voigt. The $ 75 million in 
cuts was taken from the other library 
funds and the reference - circulation 
funds just not increased. All of the cuts 
were made by the Governor. not in the 
Regents request from the state. Voigt 
said he feel s that the Regents request 
was adequate to keep the library open 
but this request was blue - pencilled 
after being passed by the state 
legislature. 

Who knows what evil lurks ... 
o university is complete without its 

intricately mysterious campus 
mysteries which serve as a point of 
suspicion, gossip. and mystification. 
The hallowed halls of UCSD are no 
exception. 

Hardly an hour goes by when some 
student, faculty or campus visitor. who 
is riding the elevator in the awe 
inspiring Central Library hasn 't asked 
himself, "What has happened to the 
third floor?" For the information of 
any student who has not yet had the 
opportunity to survey the premises of 
the Central Library. the elevators (the 
only method of going from floor to 
floor in the library) do not stop on the 
third floor . For that matter. they do 
not even have a button for the third 
floor , and the little electrical device 
which lights up and lells you which 
floor you are on goes from two to four 

Severol Studies Underwoy 

without the slightest concern for the 
missing Ihird floor. 

BUT. there is a third floor! It is the 
plaza level on which outside the 
building is a plaza serving as a resting 
place for a few sculptures (this is one 
floor above the main lobby in which 
you enter) . 

Whalever does lurk on this 
inaccessible floor , is the great 
mystery. Guesses and rumors as to its 
contents range from the conservative 
"maybe they bind books there." to a 
wild array of illicit businesses. 
including a store house for secret 
government publication . a torture 
chamber for anti-administrat ion 
student . and a hou e of questionable 
repute . 

Librarians working within the 
library itself were questioned and gave 

slightly varying answers which yielded 
little explanation : " It's just full of 
concrete and pillars." "I think they're 
going to put a sculpture exhibition in 
there." .. uh ..... nothing." 

The third floor is not totally 
inaccessible, however. There are steps 
within the library which must at least 
pass the third floor. but as to whjHher 
there are entrances to it from the steps 
remains to be seen, as one cannot get 
into the steps without sounding an 
alarm. There are also four doors on the 
plaza level , all of which are double 
locked. 

So it is impossi ble to say what lurks 
behind the locked doors of floor three. 
Most likely. nothing worth anyone's 
concern. Bu t then one never knows. At 
best we can just wonder about it and 
hope " floor three's a jolly good 
fellow ."

A littlHnoWII yet highly amusing sub-culture 
has evolYed at'UCSD, a sub-culture in which 
literature is the dominant mode of artistic 
creatiYlty. Strangely enough, the roots of this 
new renaissance movement stem from one of 
tbe most unlikely places imaginable, the 
lavatory. 

GRAFITTI: Potpourri . too. is widely found on the walls of washrooms, and audience - respunse graffiti is fairly popular : " By a strange coincidence, the optimum angle 
for intercourse is 33 degrees. I just wish- there 
was someone here to do it to ... maybe more 
than one. 

Indeed. if brevity is the soul of wit, this new 
highly stylistic art, that of writing graffiti, is 
amoll(! one of the most humorous aspects of 
college life. It provides an avenue of escape for 
frustration in the sublimated form of poems, 
short stories and snide remarks etched lightly 
into freshly painted> walls . In order that we 
might appreciate the true beauty and grace of 
these fascinating works, we must first analyze 
the works themselves to enable us to discover 
the motivation behind their efforts.

These are but three examples of the potent 
one-liners which combine terseness with lyrical 
beauty to convey their feelings. But in order 
that we may more deeply perceive the true 
nature of these caustic quips, I have compiled 
the following list of them for your perusal : 

(1) Believe it or not, the Nabisco kid has been 
here too, 

(2) If the -real difference between peace and 
piece were the raising of an index finger , there 
would be few(,f of you people killing each other 
out there. 

(3) Kill Trotsky. 
(4) This is where Napoleon tore his 

Bonaparte. 
(5) Everything is an illusion. 
(6) Jack Webb is a junkie. 
(7) Baby, stick out Â· your can, 'cause here 

comes the garbage man. 
(S) Boredom, my friend , is fear to get away 

from oneseU and create. 
(9) Moby Dick is not a social disease : grape 

nuts is . 
(10) Post no signs. 
(11) 200 billion flies couldn't be wrong. 

(l2 ) Notice : Feces 3 Ibs. and over must be 
lowered by rope. 

(13 ) The term 'tool'. when taken in its gross 
sense, does seem to be the proper terminology 
when speaking of computers. 

(14) Self-love is first , so masturbate. 
( 15) Revolutionary change is necessary if the 

graffiti is to improve. 
(6) Do you have split ends? Then you ' re in the 

wrong bathroom. 
(17) God is a concept by which man judges hi s 

potentialities. 
(18 ) God is dead.-Nietzsche. Nietzsche is 

dead.-God (Please keep in mind that these 
specimens were obtained at great danger to life 
and limb.) 

The next category of graffiti to be explored is 
the 'cryptical suspense category. While 
exploring the far torners of dark , eerie 
lavatories, my associates and I came upon 
traces of a creature whose identity was cleverly 
revealed by its creator : 

" Who is Jack Pancake? In the name of the 
Lord. Jack Pancake, rise and walk. 'But Lord, 
that could be so messy just now,' " 

" Watch out for Jack Pancake .. . be careful 
where you flush ." 

" Jack Pancake is still here (regardless of all 
janitors' cleaning fluid ). His spirit transcends 
mundane reality," 

"Clues to tI.e identity of Jack Pancake .. . 
a. He's everywhere' . 
b. He's brown. 
c . He's banana-shaped and smaller than a 
breadbox. 
d. He's often found swimming. 
e. He's identifiable by the sense of smell."

The COlllmunity 
Needs You 

by Juan Lopez 
Commi ioner of Community-Service 

The purpose of the Office of Community Services is to 
enbance the involvement of tbe University community with the 
local communities, as well as providing a service whereby 
students, faculty and staff can become more familiar with the 
needs of various agencies tbrough volunteer service. 

From time to t.ime, for example. organizations may call on 
students to volunteer their services in eliminating a particular 
problem, while many organizations open their doors for 
students seeking to gain experience and insight in a certain 
vocation. Arrangements can be made so that Interested 
individuals be given a tour of facility and receive general 
information on activities of tbe agencies. 

For example, the American Red Cross is seeking hostesses 
for the Navy Hospital Dances, which will be held on Oct. 26, 
Nov. 23 and Dec. 14. Interested girls or dorms may call Miss 
Marnie Brice at 239-2439 for information regarding the dances 
or general information. In addition, the Red Cross has various 
projects that students can volunteer for, such as, working witb 
deaf-mute children in various communities. Call Miss Jo Reed 
at 291Â·2620 for more information. 

People to people Program 
Last Year UCSD initiated a program called People to 

People, which allowed the University community to discuss 
their views on various topics with local residents. The success 
of tbe program was due to the responce from citizens 
throughout the San Diego area who requested students and 
'faculty members to come to their homes for discussions . It is 
hoped that interested individuals will volunteer to activate tbis 
most meeded program. 

Providing guided tours of UCSD for prospective students, as 
well as the general public. is another service offered by the 

BSU: 

Office of Community Services. Often special interest gorups 
will request a number of students to show them around 
campus. The following are dates and times when students will 
be needed to give tours :

Volunteers are also needed to raise money and collect food 

and clothing for tbe striking farmworkers in San Ysidro, soutb 
of San Diego. The cause of the farm workers bas in the past 
brought many diversified groups together to work at bringing 
justice to the field worker. Last year students and faculty 
contributed more tban $2,000. Nevertheless, this year that sum 
should be surpassed. 

Services to BIDd Needed 
Anotlier service that is needed. but has bad trouble becoming 

a reality is a guide and reader service for the blind and 
handicapped students. Although tbe guides would bave to 
volunteer, the readers can be paid a minimum amount through 
a funding agency provided for blind students. A few hours a day 
devoted to helping these disadvantaged students would be 
greatly appreciated. 

Finally, Community Services this year is trying to develop 
an inter-(:ultural exchange program with University students 
in Tijuana and Enscnada, Baja California. The program will be 
directed at enhancing the understanding between cultures, 
through educational programs. Various types of activities will 
be organized during the year to bring togetber students from 
both sides of the border. 

In summary. the Office of Community Services bas available 
a selective number of projects in which the University 
community can participate. Now that the first frustrating 
weeks of school bave past, students may want to engage In one 
of the above projects, or may want to develop their own. 

Any responses to these projects should be directed to Juan 
Lopez. Commissioner of Community Service, Building 250 at 
Mattbewg Campus, ext. 2381. The Community Services project 
information is available on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9Â·12. 
Please volunteer your services. The community needs you. 

On Building Black Consciousness 
organ for tbe Black community 
and Black UCSD students. by TO~lnlY Caliml'(' 

"Credo: Black students of 
UCSD, aware and realizing tbe 
many and varied, subtle and 
overt means of tbe oppressor, 
bereby propose a viable 
movement, using tbe means 
necessary to purge oppressive 
and racist systems. Tbe 
vanguard of tbat movemenl on 
tbis campus is tbe UCSD Black 
Student Union, operating out of 
tbe maximum parlicipatioa 
structure, will beocefortb 
solemnly minister to tbe needs 
and problems of Black people 
"tiIlthe struggle is done." 

The latter credo is that which 
represents the aspirations of 
many Black students on the 
UCSD campus. The Black 
Student Union has recognized 
itself as being a positive 
approach to many problems 
which confront Black students 
on all levels at UCSD. For 
example, within the philosophy 
of BSU is stated. "the BSU 
believes further. that the 
American educational system. 
be ing ba sed on white 
nationalism. (i.e.. White 
history ), w)1ite literature . 
white art. and white heroes. 
(all of which reinforce white 
folkways. mores etc. I is not 

capable Of equipping Black 
students with the necessary 
understanding and 
appreciation of the culture, 
history, and ethnic group 
problems of the Black 
community." In essence then. 

BUT 
WAfS 
SO SeL.-
FI<SH , 

I â€¢ 

the Black Student Union is 
moving on a level of self-
determination. selfÂ·defense 
and selfÂ·awareness. 

Some of the fundamental 
purposes of BSU are to serve as 
a " research and information" 

Miss Debra Sims, a BSU 
member said, " I as a Black 
woman first , and a Black 
student secondly , have 
recognized my role and 
obligation in terms of Black 
education . This is why I am a 
participanlin BSU." 

Mr. Robert Baxter, another 
active member of BSU had a 
different statement to make. 
He said, " the role of any Black 
student is to move in a positive 
direction with otber Black 
students in an allÂ· white 
institution, uch as the setting 
of the UCSD campus. 1 tbink 
BSU is a beautiful organization 
in which UCSD Black students 
should unit, utilizing it for our 
educational and community 
development ... 

As with most Black student 
organizations on majority 
white colleges and universities , 
lhere is sure to be some kind of 
white faculty / student and 
administration paranoia . This 
is in terms of " niggers" 
attempting to destroy negative 
values which bas been forced 
upon them . However, there is 
also a completely different 
perspective. Taking a broad

letters to the Editor 
Agnewism 

Editor : 
I am a graduate of UCSD who 

lives in the area , and has 
consequenUy continued to read 
the Triton Times and other 
campus journals. I have just 
read the October 20, issue of 
Dimension, and the October 19, 
issue of the Triton Time . 
Having followed Dimension 
since its beginnings I was, of 
course. well aware ' of its 
political persuasion, but this 
last issue contained articles in 
such bad taste as to be 
vomitous. "The Bootblack 
Stand" leUer about Charles 
Manson which humorously 
treats a man condemned to die 
as a political element of the 
left, and then compares him 
with Tunney and Cranston, is 
one of the sickest things I have 
ever read. 

In the same issue, Jim Sill 's 
article on Third College shows 
absolutely no objectivity, nor 
even an attempt to give a 
thoughtful evaluation of the 
curriculum . It is pure 
invective, calcula ted to anger , 
arouse, and divide. I had not 
realized that the anti -
intellectualism of Agnewism 
had permeated to such an 
extent that even university 
conservatives no longer feel 
compelled to consider the 
facts. 1 can not speak with 
authority about the curriculum 
of Third College, and do not 
know to what extent it is 
indoctrinaLing students with 
leftist ideology without 
educating them. My opinion, 
from talking to students and 
teachers, is that it is moving in 
the direction of more hard core 
course work : preparing Third 
World students to be in the 
vanguard of the necessary 
professions of medici ne. law. 
economics , and education . 

In any case, it should be clear 
from Mr. Sills' letter that no 
college has a monoply on 
stud ents who will echo 
anything polemic for the sake 
of attracting attention. and one

Ego Trips 
Editor : 

1 am sick and tired of all this 
dribble forced on the readers of 
the TT by defl!ult. Any paper 
that is not self supporting is not 
deserving of publication. I do 
not think that $25 for 50 hrs. 
work is much worse than lhe 
figure of 30 hrs. work for 2 unit 
that Reville bio majors are 
reputed to put into the fruit fly 
lab. 1 believe that the two data 
have equal credulence. Why 
can 't the personell of the 
campus media provide services 
for credit? EOP has done this 
and had a great responce. If a 
cause is deserving or at leasl 
has some amount of devotion 
the time will be given . It 
remains to be seen if the TT is 
deserving of any support at all . 
Any problems in the budget 
aired in the lengthy reports of 
the comm board meeting could 
easily be solved if no salaries 
were collected. It would also be 
a great test of how much staff 
members really cared about 
their newspaper or if it is only 
an ego trip with rewards. The 
contents of this letter pertain 
to all campus media .

Genocide or 
Equality? 

Editor ' 
For several years I have 

been concerned about overÂ· 
population in the United States 
and in the world . The current 
rate of population growth is 
already a severe problem for 
poor people. For example, food 
production per person declined 
in most African countries last 
year and it has been declining 
for several years. Therefore I 
was disturbed to see an article 
by Mr. Simms in a recent 
Triton Times which claimed 
that birth control programs 
aimed at the poor in the United 
States were a veiled form of 
genocide. Having heard this 
charge before from black 
radicals, I decided to look 
further into the matler. The 
most recent data in the 
"Statistical Abstract of the 
Uniled Slates" are as follows . 
Births / IOOO population : 
white, 16.6: "negro and other," 
24 .2. Births/ lOOO females aged

people tend to be poorer than 
white people would lead to the 
result lhat a higher percentage 
of blacks would receive AfDC. 
Undoubtedly the rate of 
population growth for blacks 
will approach that for whites as 
their income levels approach 
those of whiles, but thi will 
take some tIme and the growth 
rate of the white population is 
too high anyway. 

Today the bad effects of 
overpopUlation , such as 
crowded living conditions and 
pollution. are visited primarily 
upon the poor. It cannot be 
denied that the rich have 
easier access to the 
information and doctor' s 
prescriptions necessary for 
successful birth control. It 
would seem then that the 
establishment of free birth 
control clinics open to the poor 
would be a great benefit for 
them. I wanl to state clearly 
that I am not advocating any 
compulsory programs, only 
that the poor ~hould be given 
the same opportunities for 
contraception enjoyed by the 
rich . 1 don 't believe this sort of 
program should be labeled 
"genocide" or equated with 
Auschwitz.

Surfing Club 
Presents Film 

It is going to be a big year for 
the UCSD Surf Club. With a 
still growing membership (50 
members at the momentl , the 
club is large enough to insure 
active participation in inter -
collegiate surfing contests. 
Many of the members are 
excellent surfers and it would 
be no surprise if UCSD wa to 
win the league title this yea r. 

The club is not just 
concerned with competitive 
surfing. but with all other 
aspects of surfmg as well . The 
club will provide the members 
with surfboard materials and 
wetsuits at discount prices. 
Hopefully the club will also 
have surfboards and wetsuits 
for use by members who have 
the interest to surf but not the 
means. All people interested in 
surfing are urged to become 
members. 

With favorable turnout and 
support the club hopes to have 
surfing trips during the year . 
These trips will be possible 
through a small budget allotted 

by the P.E. DepartlT\ent and 
various fund raising activities. 

The first activity will b-: the 
presentation of " Pacific 
Vibrations" on Saturday, Nov 
13 at 8:30 p.m. in the gym. 
"Pacific Vibrations" is a 
surfing film by John Severson, 
former editor and publisher of 
Surfer magazine. American 
International purchased the 
film and processed a 35 mm . 
version which is currently 
showing in regular theaters. 

The UCSD surf club was very 
fortunate in getting the film 
and it will probably be the last 
time the film is shown, aside 
from regular theaters. The 
film is a full length color 
feature with footage of 
California and Hawaii. Two of 
the many highlights are Tom 
Stone inside at pipeline and 
Jeff Hakman in flight at 
Honoloua Bay . Anyone who 
believes man should be in 
harmony with na ture must see 
this film . Tickets will be sold at 
the door. UCSD students $1. 
general admission SI .50.

Leslie Kienholz . UCSI) s first girl 
referee. Leslie. who insists that the 
hardest thing about refereeing is 
keeping your mind on the game. not the 
guys. is officiating coed football and 
becoming more proficient and confident 
as a ref week by week. 

Any referee will be the first to admit 
he dOesn't see every penalty or that he 
does blow orne calls. but a good 
indicator of what kind of a game you're 
getting from a ref is whether he's 
hustling before. during and after every 
play. Sure. he'1I 1et you bitch about a ca ll 
that went against you I indeed he has 
probably done plenty of complaining as 
a player himself I. butonlytoa point l 

Jimmy reports that more officials will 
be needed as basketball season get 
under way in w~nter quarter. If you're 
interested and think you can hack it , get 
ill touch with Lee Johnson at X2282 . 
Most of thi s quarter's off icials are 
enjoying their work and it appears that , 
although rile Two-Legged Zebra is 
constantly on the endangered species 
list, the chance of its extincition is 
minimal. 

Fish Fry Frestlo 
This is about the Fresno State game, a rather typical affair 

which began around lunchtime last Saturday and came to a 
happy ending just in time ror dinner . The final score was 14-13, 
though , as you may already know. this indicates neither the 
tempo of play nor the points amassed by the refs. who scored 
93. 

The Tritons were in no sense of the world "up " for the game. 
having played the day before. and it showed at the end of a 
disasterous 1st quarter. 5-2 Fresno. But Fresno was able to 
cope with neither the refs nor the perseverance of the local fish 
and soon the game had evened out to another one of those one 
goal affairs. At one point in the third quarter . the locals led 9-6. 
but that was perhaps deceiving. 

By the time the end of the quarter rolled around. it was clear 
that foul s would be a telling factor. Four UCSD starters were 
sitting on the sidelines. having bumbled their way out on fouls . 
by the time the final gun sounded leavmg everyone in the 
stands wondering what happens in a tie game. The answer is 
overtime, which to those of you who became confused. really 
consists of two periods, so that each team i stuck with the 
shallow end once. With a minute and a half left in this 
extension, Fresno fouled out a man and found that there lI'as 
nobody in the place left who would play on their side. 

This. it must be admitted, shook the Tri tons a little. for they 
had been ahead in score before . but never in men. Such a 
situation should be an automatic goal every lime down court. 
but to add to the excitement of the game, the Tritons decided to 
blow it the first three times they had the ball . A fell' seconds 
later . it appeared that Stoner pulled a boner. collecting his fifth 
foul. In the ensuing mess. Wonder Boy cleverly reversed his 
cap ana convinced the official scorer he was a sub-and 
reentered the tank . Bad decision, though. as a fist in the face 
caused him to play aslh~ a little tipsy the rest of the game. 

When the overtime gun sounded everyone realized that 
UCSD had screwed around so much that they still hadn 't won. 
Embarrasing. with an extra man and all. A historical first (for 
UCSD) followed. sudden death. For the first lime of the day 
UCSD won the spring. the ball , and hence the game. They 
played a clever strategy passing from Stoner to Pickle. to 
Stoner to Pickle to Stoner to Pickle to Sti1lenger. AHA? Fooled 
everyone in the place but the goalie. Fortunately Dave 's shot 
was perfect. burning the hair out of the goalie 's armpit , and 
Fresno went home disgusted. 

Records and firsts : Pickle popped a ball . but also scored 7 
goals : Mark Reimer thrown out [or illegally treading water : 
Gary Becker, first coaching foul : Trudy. quickest and dumbest 
finger on the buzzer. taking a goal away: And of course. 
Stillenger . best shooting percentage. I for I. 

Saturday Oxy at II. bring a lunch. By the wa y, if you have 
any questions about the game that you 're burning to have 
answered, write them to Box 6234 . but please not about the 
refling , cause we just can't explain them . ..

The tage was set [or the 
usual outstanding performance 
of Ed AvO!. He placed third in 
the running with a good time of 
33 :02. A plea ant urprise was 
the running of Bob De 
Leonardis. He is becoming 
very consistent and finished 
directly behind Avol in fourth . 
The depth was provided by the 
performances of Kirk Newell 
and Jerry King. These runners 
finished lOth and 8th . 
respectively . tFigure that one

the week in review 

baer on bach 
roberto axel rod 

An oft-repeated success max im for informal classica l 
concerts goes something like this ... "Make it Bach, and make it 
free. " On Sunday night. John Baer anc l:is company of 
musicians and friends took the last step: they made it good as 
well . 

The mood of the evening was certainly informal. and as 
intimate as it could be considering the enormous crowd that 
did come. The audience was quite diversified : burnoosed and 
bewhiskered aficinado sa t on the noor along ide the ladies of 
La Jolla : but the love of baroque furnished a present-if-shortÂ· 
lived bond between. The performers were gently arrayed and ' 
arranged in a tintype elegance, qUite removed fro m the 
ironclad virtuosity of many Bach concerts. 

The first piece. "Concerto for 2 Harpsichords in C major," 
was glowy and soft. with the aud ience swaying to the baroque 
rhythm. (I counted at least 15 simultaneous rockers. with a 
nu'mber of Ie s-emphatic nodders and tappers l. The timbral 
dirrerence between the two harpsichords created a subtly two-
voiced effect. with the chamber orchestra providing a defi ning 
background. The next piece was the " 6th Brandenburg 
Concerto," for viola and continuo : this. a difficult and 

rh~thmically Intricate piece. was well carried-off by the group. 
A cantata. "Jauch let Gott in Allen Landen (no. 51 )," " praise 

Cod In all the land ," wa the third pie('e performed The 
presentation was respectful without being heaVily religIOUS. 
most eVident was the sweet conflict of the high soprano vocal 
part against the trumpet and orche tra . The audience was 
absolutelY transfixed bv the melodvÂ·waves. 

The last piece was the "Harpsichord Concerto in D minor ;" 
a complex work . it provided the musIcians with a chance to 
display their technical abilnies as well a their muslcally-
translated feelings . The piece centered on an electric 
harpSichord part I figurativel\, speakmg I which was performed 
wiht a gr at deal of gallantn' As the piece neared close. the 
audience was on edge . one could almost feel the collective 
satisfaction at th end Daresay . Bach would have dug it.

"Turandol." Puccinl's most elaborate opera . was performed 
last week at the an Diego Civic Theater. Although Puccini did 
not hve to complete the opera . Franco Alfano did admirable 
job In completing th last duet and the flOal scene. Alfano 's 
work has been subjected to a great deal of critici m slOce the 
opera's first performance in 1926 To canini once refused to 
conduct past PUCClnI'S olin v.ork . On the whole . however.

" Music is a mirror of life," according to Louis Krasner , 
distinguished violinist who is the current guest lecturer in the 
UCSD Music. Department. Krasner has presented two 
seminars , in which he played the Berg Violin Concerto and the 
Schoenberg Violin Concerto. Both recitals were unquestionably 
excellent. exciting and thought-provoking. The foremost 
thought in my mind concerned the violinist himself. I found 
Krasner to be an intelligent conversationalist, a revolutionary 
musician, and an incredible man. 

He was born in Russia and came as a child to the U.S. He 
studied music at the Boston Conservatory and then went on to 
Europe to play. Krasner 's insatiable curiosity led him to 
explore new musical fields . Therefore he he- worked a great 
deal with new music and its composers, among them Alban 
Berg. Arnold Schoenberg and Anton Webern. Krasner has 
chosen the other road , musically speaking, innovating and 
attacking problematic music head-on. Not many travel this

risky road, especially when .. nother far safer and easier way is 
available. But then again, not many achieve the success and 
satisfaction of being an individual, as Krasner has. 

We talked of the problems in music today and some very 
important ideas were brought out. Music has been an intrinsic 
part of man but recently , it seems, society makes music a 
subsidiary of man. Music has been owned, so to speak, by the 
churches, the royalty and then the courts - all of whom 
dictated what it was to be, how it should be played and when. 
Presently, we have "rich bankers" subsidizing concert halls 
and orchestras. 5000 years ago, music was never like this . It 
was financed , dictated and created by the people. It actually 
touched them for they were instrumental in its existence. 

with a Virtuoso 
There is a movement among youth today to try and bring 

music back " for the people." they want to make the music 
their own, very personal. Such devotion , intensity and 
expressiveness has never been seen be(ore. But the movement 
insists on using its own music - often times I'noisy," as 
Krasner says. And because an establishment views it as such, 
it is, of course made louder and noisier by the movement. 
Krasner looks toward the new generation to carryon musical 
and social change but not at the expense of throwing away 
classical music . The music field must change, as must SOCiety, 
especially those cases in which concert music becomes only a 
social appendage, another frill of " good society." The leaders 
of these orchestras do nothing to bring on new, challenging 
music, except when they are forced, once again by society. 

Another problem in music is whether it should be made only 
an esoteric, academician 's art. That way, there would be no 
misunderstanding as to who would listen and who would 
create. But music is also an entertainment. " It is a museum 
and circus at the same time." Closing music to the people

we somehow hot into a 
conversation about meat, and 
how come I don 't eat meat 
myself. Then into the spiritual 
thing. I think a lot about Cod ,

want to get into the heart of 
things - if a pwrson was a ware

In New York he began to find 
musicians who felt as he did 
about music . The fr ee 
expression and 
experimentations of Coleman, 
Don Cherry and others helped 
expand Sanders ' ideas further. 
And all during this time, his 
friend hip with John Coltrane 
grew. The two had become 
quite close, and would diSCUSS 
extensively elements of life 
and religion. 

Together they searched for 

Pharoah Sanders to Blow His Sax 
inten e as any in jazz today. 

The musical journ y of 
Sanders is one which might 
enable the listener (a nd 
reader ) to better feel his 
music. 

Born in Little Rock . 
Arkansa in 1940. Sanders had 
an early interest in becoming 
an artist. In junior high. his 
interests turned towards 
music . First as a percussioni t. 
and later as a reedman, 

~haroah ga ined much insight 
into jazz from his high school 
band di rector . It wa wh n he 
was fifteen that he began to 
become fascinated by the 
various ounds that could 
emerge from wind 
instruments. 

Pharoah began to expa nd his 
understanding through 
studying the tuba . baritone 
horn . drums. clarinet. and 
flute . When he was nineteen hc 
began tudying the tenor 
saxophone .. By this time he was 
playing with various R&B 
groups that cam through 
town. A ide from Itung '" with 
musiCians. he began to listen to 
vanous recordings of jazz. 
copying the solo leads. and 
imprOVising on top of them . 

I\lajored in Art 
Not ",antin!! to stav In the 

outh. Pharoah accepted a 
cholarship to Oakland JUDlor 

College ID t959 There h 
majored in art but continued 
plavlOg rock and blues gigs lor 
a few vears lie was now 
listening' to Coltrane. Ornette 
Coleman. Sonm Rollins. Eric 
Dolphy. Booke'r Ervin, Hank 
Mobelv, Bennv Colson and 
Horace Silver"s group. His 
main interest was in tenor 
saxophon Pharoah thought 
that one should play whatever 
h felt . and realized this more 
when he met and worked with 

trouble fitting a mouthpiece. 
This is a time that I all\'ays 
remember, John asked me if I 
would go out and help him find 
some mouthpieces. At the time 
I had about 25 or 30 
mouthpieces. and I couldn't 
fi nd the sound that I wanted out 
of the mouthpieces. ' so we 
looked together. I still can 't 
find the ri ght mouthpiece . 

" Well. anyway. we went 
through pawn shops and got out 
this mouthpiece and that one 
and left that one and went to 
another - there were lots of 
pawn shops and it was tak ing 
all day long. And in the 
meantim , he bought some 
mouthpieces bUl l don 't thi nk-

think we would have a more 
beautiful world ." 

Spiritual Expression 
Brings Closeness 

This turn towards a spiritual 
expre sion of oneself drew 
Sanders and Coltrane closer 
together. Sa nders decided to go 
to New Youk 'in 1962. He made 
it acro s in a - car that 
constantly broke down , and 
began .his tay with absolutely 
no money. 

His fi rst gig ID New York was 
with "C" Sharp and Billy 
Higgins. [t paid $8 a night. and 
las ted close to a year. He also 
supported himself as a cook-
waiter-counte r-man. 

clearer forms of 
communica tion through music. 
and pushed to see if they could 
fi nd what they could do with 
their music in the future. 
Coltrane noted . "Sanders is a 
ma n of la rge spirit ual 
reservoir. He's always trying 
to reach out to truth . He's 
trying to allow his spiritual self 
to be his guide. He's dealing, 
among other things, in energy, 
in integri ty. in essences." 

Sanders has continued the 
search for tru th that Coltrane 
began some eight years ago. 
With it, he tries to express his 
feelings in the purest form : "I 
feel that If a person wants to 
play music, you know, h just 
takes what he has and comes 
ou t to play. You know, [al ways 
feel that if you have somethlOg 
to say, then play no matter 
what. If you've got that kind of 
energy you should play - It'S 
like I say to you, come on out 
and pl ay ." (Jazz, and Pop, 
Feb .. 1970 1 

In writing to an audience not 
accustomed to Sand rs ' style. 
music cri tic John Sinclair said. 
" The band 's sound moves from 
the softest moans and b lis and 
tambourines to the most 
intense nonamplified spirit-cry 
to be hea rd anYWhere, wiht a 
ra nge of melody and f hng 
that is astounding. When the 
songs are allowed to move to 
their natural ends, with 
Pharoah crying the terrific 
scream of hi s tenor saxophone, 
th sound is as intense and as 
full of feeling as you are ev~r 
likely to hear . I'll promise you 
one thing : you 've never heard 
anything like this band andÂ· its 
music before. Pharoah Sanders 
is a man and a mu ician of 
great strength and beauty and 
you would do well to get 
yourself next to him as soon as 
you can." 

would make them lose all cosmic sense. Fortunately, there 
isn't much of a chance for this extreme condition to occur, 
because even today, the audience has its demands, and the 
artist, his need to express. 

Many groups and individuals in the field of music today are 
extremely talented, .. , DO' sellolarly. Music is an art and 
because of this there are standards by which it must be judged. 
Maybe we overlook too many standards in analyzing music 
today. We are satisfied with less, I believe. 

Krasner hopes that music will become more a part of the 
mainstream of the new ideas of the young, In addition to 
enjoying their own music they should bring over from across 
the tracks those musicians and their music who aren't 
supposed to be there anyway. They always listened to a 
different drummer. " 

I have been greatly innuenced by talking with Krasner. One 
forgets, while the radio is blasting, the stereo screaming and 
one's roommate's Jew's harp twanging, that music is not to be 
tolerated, but truly feIt and consciously absorbed into one's 
life.

[XDO~ITION 

Los Angeles, the world 's center of film production, now joins 
New York , San Francisco, Cannes, Venice, and Berlin in 
presenting to the public a motion picture event of internationa I 
importance : the Los Angeles International Film Exposition. 

Filmex, the abbreviated title for the presentation, will 
present to the Los Angeles public the entire cinematic 
spectrum : " vintage " films, new films, animated films, 
documentaries and underground pieces. 

Among the new films 10 have their premiere at the Filmex 
are : Peter Bogdanovich's "The Last Picture Show" 
(Bogdanovich is the gentleman who directed "Targets"); 
" Blushing Charlie" by Vitgot Sjoman of " I am Curious" and 
"491" fame); "The Cow," directed by Daryush Mehrjui from 
Iran : and " Rip-Off" by UCLA graduate Donald Shebib, who 
filmed the movie in Canada.

charge to the II a .m. showings of the movies, and, any student 
(if he or she has a valid student identification card ) will be able

by Manny Farber (who is also a professor in the Visual Arts 
Department at UCSDI . films dealing with alienation, crime 
and corruption . Americ::ln films by such directors as Sam

decade of unusual prosperity 
which enabled more families 
to send their children to 
college. 

Long thinks that the select 

committee will concentrate 
. on planning ~hanisms that 

will enable th& state to keep 
pace with changing trends in 
higher education rather than 
making specific predictions 
of figures such a s enrollments 
and costs. 

While Long is cri tical of 
some of the master plans' 
data projections. he giv,!\ it 
credit for providing greaUy 
increased opportunity for 
many California students. 
However, he didn't think 
"anyone imagined the state 
could absorb that many 
students . " 

The select committee also 
will examine the prospects 
for improving statewide 
planning and coordination in 
California higher education. 
The master pia n establi shed 
the Coordinating Council for 
Higher Education to plan for 
orderly growth, but gave the 
council no power to enforce 
its recommendations. As a 
result. few people in 
Sacramento or elsewhere pay 
much attention to the council. 

Dr. Owen A. Knorr , council 
director. said this weakness 
is one of the reasons higher 
education has become

enme hed in politiCS in recent 
years . 

"There is no effective 
statewide planning and 
coordination in this slate. 
Knorr said in an interview 
"There's a vacuum at the top. 
We can't fill the vacuum With 
our weak little lIgency. so the 
politicans (of both parties I 
move in." 

It is obvious that there IS 
much lacking in the master 
plan and that 
recommendations for change 
must be made. The only 
question is wha t way the 
committee will do it . 
Accusations that the 
committee is approaching the 
problem too philosophically 
and that they are avoiding 
grappling with specific 
problems have been made. 
These people doubt that. 

Assemblyman John 
Vasconcellos ID-San Jose ). 
Chairman of the JOint 
Committee. defended his 
approach ... You have to start 
with broad . philosophical 
questions - otherwise. you're 
just shufflmg the deck again. 
like they did with the first 
master plan - buI I don 'l 
intend to stop here. We '\I be 
coming along with exact 
[actual precise findings and 
recommenda tion ."
