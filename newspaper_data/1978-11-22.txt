Assembly Will 
Hold Hearings 
Here Next Week 

By Jeff Beresford-Howe 
AIIMA.1e News EdU ... 

State Assembly maverick 
John Vasconcellos, known for 
bis concern with statewide 
educational issues, will hold 
hearings along with the Assem-
bly Ways and Means Subcom-
mittee at UCSD Thursday and 
Friday of next week. 

The hearings are being held 
so that three professors who 
were scheduled to testify at the 
subcommittee's hearings last 
March at UC Santa Barbara 
will have time to address the 
subcommittee. Tbe three 
professors, one of whom is Dr. 

Stanley Chodorow; a tenured 
member of the UCSD History 
department, were unable to 
address the subcommittee 
because of time limitations. 

Two UCSD Academic Affairs 
Commission members, Linda 

In the story on the Urban and 
Rural Studies Ethnicity 
Seminar in Monday's Guardian 
we incorrectly identified one of 
the speakers at the seminar as 
Randy Woodard, counselor for 
the Disabled Students Union. 
Woodard was not at the 
seminar and the remarks 
attributed to him were made by 
another person who spoke on 
the problems of disabled 
students. We re,ret any incon-
venience caused by this error. 

Sabo and Olivier Kolpin, co-
directors of what has been 
called the "Tenure Project," 
were instrumental in con-
vincing Vasconcellos to hold 
the continuation of the hearings 
here rather than at another UC 
campus. Last spring both 
Kolpin and Sabo testified 
before the subcommittee in 
Sacramehto on the tenure 
issue. 

Kolpin and Sabo will speak at 
the hearings Friday afternoon. 
Friday morning three pro-
fessors who did not get the 
chance to testify in Santa 
Barbara will speak. 
Admlniltradoa Not InvoJved 
The UCSD Administration 

has been almost completely 
divorced from participating in 
the Vasconcellos visit, while 
students, throueh the AS and 
Third College, and the Third 
College staff, have been ac-
tively involved in planning for

Armitaae Won't Step In 
UJS Turne1i Down in Fund Appeal 
By Jeff Beresford-Howe 

Assocla&e News Editor 
Vice-Chancellor of Student 

Affair. Richard Armitage 
Monday told a group of students 
from the UJS that " I don't 
particularly want to get in-
volved in student-to-student 
issues," or act as a "censor" in 
student politics. 

The students were protesting 
a $25 allocation by the AS 
Council to the National Alliance 
Against Racism and Political 
OppreSSion for use funding a 
speaker from the National 
Lawyer's Guild, an organiza-
tion the protesters claim is a 
known supporter of the "ter-
roristic" Palestine Liberation 

Organization. 
Armitage told the students 

that " I would not pretend to 
h~ve such superior wisdon .. . 
otherwise, I leave myself open 
to becoming the judge of what's 
right and wrong... it doesn't 
mean I disagree or agree with 
you." 

A major point of contention 
was whether the National 
Lawyer's Guild. which spon-
sored a speech by the Palestine 
Liberation Organization Infor-
mation Officer last spring, had 
solicited funds on campus, a 
violation of campus rules. 

UJS members argued that 
the Guild should be prohibited 
from receiving funds as a 

known violator of campus 
rules, but Armitage said that he 
had seen no confirmation of 
that fact, adding that he "would 
prefer not to act on actions of 
the previous administration," 
hoping instead to establish a 
"clean slate" in dealing with 
campus organizations. 

The UJS met last night to 
discuss possible action again t 
the Guild or the AS allocation, 

Bill Friedman, Council and 
UJS member, said " We are not 
goin to protest the alJocation. 
We feel that the issue has 
backfi red on us ... a lot of people 
perceive us as having a racist 
outlook, which is not true."

Day Care Center: Change in Education 
By Eric Harpell 

Staff Writer 
The children at the UCSD 

Day Care Center now have the 
opportunity to learn and play in 
a productive and educational 
environment, an environment 
different from the un anitary 
and overcrowded one that 
faced the children of the co-op 
run Day Care Center that 
existed previou to 1975. aid a 
staff member who has seen 
both Centers. 

According. to Kathleen Ruda, 
the underSlzd staff used to 
band Ie "fifty or sixty 
kids " each day . Because 
the Center did not receive 
sufficient funding for 
enough full -time staff per-
sonnel, parents were required 
to work at the Center on a 
rotating basis, she said. 

"Parents would often call in 
and say, '( have to study for an 
exam,' or else they (the 
parents) would try to study at 
the Center when they did come 
to work. Many time I would be 
taking care of eighteen toddlers 

by myself. That amounted to 
changing seventy diapers a 
day," Ruda said. 

"Having parents work at the 
Center was defeating it own 
purpose," she said. Parents 
originc.!ly place their children 
in day care centers "becau e 
going to school interfered with 
their time to care for them ..

While the Center wa run on a

Two New Cases May Have Greater Impact than Bakke~s 
By Joel Dreyfuss 

Pac:U1c: News Servlee 
Their names may not be very 

familiar at this point, but 
chances are that James Cra-
mer and Brian Weber will 
become as much a part of the 
nation's vocabulary in the 
future as Allan Bakke was 
during the past year. These two 
white men have filed charges of 
"reverse discrimination" that 
could have an even greater 
national i mpact than last 
year's highly touted racial 
melodrama involving the space 
engineer who wanted to be-
come a doctor. 
Joel Dreyfuss is the au thor of a 

book on the Bakke case to be 
published by Harcourt, Brace.

former staff reporter for the 

Wasbington Post and tbe 
New York Post.) 

The U.S. Supreme Court's 
Bakke decision last spring 
primarily affected university 
admissions procedures. The 
suits brought by Cramer and 
Weber challenge voluntary 
affinnative action programs 
that give preferential treat-
ment to minorities and women 
in employment. And since the 
issue here involves jobs, a 
Supreme Court decision could 
affect thousands of programs 
and millions of jobs. 

Cramer and Weber, who 
were seeking positions at 
oPPOSj~endS of the social and 
econom c spectrum, asked the 
courts determine how much 

speci~ I onsideration should be 
given t women and minorities 
when t ('Tf' ill no eat3blished

a year and twice applied for

At the jungle site of the mass

members of the American 
religious sect lay decomposing 
in the equatorial sun . U.S. 
military officials were plan· 
ning to airlift the bodies to the 
United States , but a State 
Department s pokesm an in 
Washington said they instead 
may be buried at the Jonestown 
camp if the Guyanese govern-
ment authorizes it. 

By Tbe Associated Press 
The Israeli Cabinet gave un-

qualified approval yesterday to 
a draft peace treaty with Egypt 
put forward by the United 
States but rejected Cairo's 
demands for a timetable on 
resol v ing the P alestini a n 
question. 

Egypt recalled its chief 
negotiator from the talks in 
Washington for consultations 
after the Israeli decision. 

Egyptian officials said before 
the Cabinet's announcement in 
Jerusalem that a treaty will not 
be signed uless Israel changes 
its position on a timetable. 

"The Egyptian government 
is studying the situation in light 
oUhe Israeli Cabinet decision, .. 
Prime Minister Mustafa Khalil 
told The Asociated Press. 

Prime Minister Menachem 
Begin infonned reporters in 
Jerusalem of the Cabinet's 
decision and said Israel "is 
prepared to sign the treaty of 
peace .. .if Egypt is ready to act 
likewise." 

'The draft was worked out 10 
days ago between Secretary of 
State Cyrus _R. Vance and 
Israeli Forein Minister MOlhe 
vayan. Sources said the text is 
almost identical to one the 
Cabinet rejected Oct. 25. 

The Egyptians are trying to 
pin Israel down to timetables on 
movement on Palestinian 
autonomy in the West Bank of 
the Jordan River and the Gaza 
Strip: Begin says the latest 
Egyptian proposals for a 
timetable are inconsistent 
with the Camp David accords 
worked out in September. He 
said Sunday Israel "will never 
accept timetables." 

" We are serious about link· 
ages and timetables," said a 
government source in Cairo, 
"and it is. our bedrock posi· 
tion. " 

The source, who declined to 
be identified, predicted the

chances are less a treaty will be

State Community Aid 
May be Cut Next Year 

. 

SACRAMENTO (AP) - The 
state won't be able to give local 
,ovemmenu as much post· 
Proposition 13 aid in coming 
years as it did this year, even 
assuming a boom economy, the 
state Senate FInance Commit-
tee was told yesterday. 

And a recession, as predicted 
for next year by many econo-
mists, could cut state revenues 
and make further help for local 
governments very difficult, 
John Vickennan of the legisla-
tive analyst's office said. 

"You're starting out this year 
with a much smaller bank 
account than you started out 
with this year. " he said. " It's 
going to be much harder to be 
generous with local govern-
ments unless you drastlcally 
cut state spending." 

Already this year: he told the 
committee, the state is not 
accumulating extra money 
from tax receipts as it has in the 
past two years. 

That extra buildup, resulting 
from inflation and a boom 
economy, gave the state the : 
$3 .7 billion surplus in July that 
allowed a $4.2 billion gift to , 
local governments to counter· 
act Proposition 13 's revenue 
cuts. 

"So far , major taxes are, 
frankly, very close to esti· 
mates. There have been no 
upward revisions in revenues 
typical of the last few years, " 
he said. . 

"The inflation effect should 
bring in a couple hundred 
million dollars" extra per 
month , he said . " I don 't see that 
coming in ." 

The committee held a hea r· 
ing on the " fiscal outlook of 
Proposition 13" in advance of 
the Legislature 's new session, 
which opens Dec. 4 but does not 
get down to business until 
January. 

Vickerman said the $3 .7 
billion surplus on hand on July 
1, when this fiscal year began, 
resulted from " very rapid 
increases in general fund 
revenues that cxceeded 011 of 
our expectations." The reasons 
inc1ude inflation , emptoyment 

gains and increased consumer 
credit. 

That means tbe surplus for 
this year hu become a $2 
billion deficit. 

from 375 to more than 775. 
Stephan Jones, son of the 
Peoples Temple (sic) sect's 
fanatical founder, the Rev. Jim 
Jones, estimated some 500 had 
gone into the inhospitable 
forest . 

Jim Jones ordered the mass 
suicide , a ritual he code·named 
"White Knight" and which he 
had practiced with his loyal 
followers , after sect members 

ambushed and killed Rep. Leo 
J . Ryan of California and four 
members of a Ryan-led party 
that made an investigative visit 
to the camp. 

Guyanese familiar with the 
area questioned whether the 
fugitives could long survive 
without shelt4!r and steady food 
supplies in a jungle filled with 
swamps and criss· crossed by 
streams and rivers .

says Liebrenz, most of the 
responsibility lies with the 
faculty in advising students 
about ,raduate schools. "Tbe 
faculty is usually very helpful. 
It is the students woo are often 
reluctant to approach profes-
sors for recommendations." 

As for response from the 
outside community, Liebrenz 
commented that in the past

year there has been a 111O'Y .. 
increase in employer visits. 
The viewpoints of prospective 
employers are, bowever, 
biased. They generally see 
UCSD students as being 
"wealthy," since UCSD costs 
more than State. And they stin 
tbink of this university as 
predominantly science- ori-
ented. But Liebrenz is gener-
ally encouraged about the 
outside response to UCSD 
graduates. Such a close inter-
action between UCSD and the 
"real world of jobs" ·is un-
precedented. 

The employers who recruit 
on campus range from tbe 
Peace Corps to IBM Corpor-
ation. In mentioning the trouble 

the CPI&P Service had last year 
when students protested the 
CIA's recruitment through 
their office, Liebrenz said. "We 
don't make career choices for 
students. They're capable of 
usin, their own reason in, 
powenl, and saying no to an 
emplOyer. Our job is to give 
them that option." 

When askect who is allowed to 
recruit on campus. Liebrenz 
replied that they bave to be 
bona-fide, an equal opportunity 
and affirmative action em-
ployer. "U Joe Blow off the 
street comes on campus, we 
want references." 

To better prepare students 
for the job-market, Liebrenz 

them ," she stated. . 

Liebrenz would like to see the 
Center expand; there are still 
lots of employers they need to 
get on campus. "But without 
additional support. this can't be 
done," she said. And because of 
Proposition 13. no additional 
funding is foreseeable. 

The Career Planning and 
Placement Service started in 
1964 to help the fresh PhDs find 
jobs. It began when the under· 
graduates arrived; in 1976 it 
expanded drastically and today 
it offers one of the mos t 
comprehensive career services 
available on a college ca!'lpus. 

Grant .Awarded for 
Science Ethics Meeting 

By Doq Cam"", . 
ScietIee E4Ihar 

'An idea suuested by fonner 
AS President Jeff Leifer bas 
resulted in the approval of a 
Irant in the amount of more 
than $'11,000 by the National 
Science Foundation (NSF) . 

Tbe grant, whicb names 
Political Science partment" 
Chairman Sanford Lakoff as Its 
Principle Investigator. will be 
used to organize a conference 
on the topic of science and 
ethics. 

According to Leifer, who bas 
been workiq on the idea for 
two yeanl, the conference will 
be named after the Populi 
Conference, which was first 
established in 1957 for the 
purpose of examinin, the 
societal ramifications of scien-
tific researcb. The U.S. Na-
tional Student Pugwasb Con-
ference on Science and Ethical 
ResponsibiUty, as it will be 
caned, will involve about 75 
students and 25 faculty and 
auest speakers in a series of 
five workabope from June 19-21. 

Leifer voiced bis enthusiasm 
for the project, adding, "It's 
very rare to let money (rom the 
NSF for pro,rams (or stu-
dents." 

Topics for the conference will 

include; IOdaI implications of 
biomedical re.earcb, scJence 
and defense PQlicy, scientific 
knowledge and val~, science 
and politics, and ' science in 
developiq countries. "We're 
in the midst of refining each of 
these topics," said Lakoff, 
explaining that he does not 
waut \be partjclpaDts a-'ll:mpt-
inI to cover too broad an area. 

The applications for student 
participants in the conference 
wili be reveiwed by Lakoff, 
Leifer and Herbert York of the 
Department of Pbysics. Gradu-
ates and from 

Jeff Leifer 

all over the country will be 
invited to apply. "We'll try to 
pick the best qualified ." 
explained Lakoff. "we want to 
get a disciplinary spread." He 
added. " We're tryin, to pair 
the scientists and the non· 
scientists. " 

According to Lakoff, the 
majority of the grant money 
Will be spent on transpurrc.Li-_. 
food and lodging for the 
participants, with some going 
toward salaries for those 
involved in the project 's 
organization and adminis· 
tration and for honorariums 
awarded to the luest speakers. 

Commenting on the com· 
plexity of procedures ~or 
obtaining the gran'l, Lakon 
said, "You have to submit very 
10Di proposals." He explained 
that not only does the NSF 
review applications, but the 
University's contract and 
Grant Administration also 
examines them. 

From UCSD, several speak· 
ers have been scheduled, 
including York, Clifford Grob-
stein, Vice-Chancellor of 
University Relations and 
Professor of Biology, Roger 
Revelle, Professor of Political 
Science, and Jonathan Seville, 
Professor of Literature. 

Ire Up Over Fund Loss 
Vending Machines Are Focus 

By Steve Morus 
Staff Wri&er 

Student anger over a deci-
sion by Vice-Chancellor of 
Administration Bernard Sisco 
to channel vending machine 
revenues away from student 
program budgets and towards 
paying for snack bar operating 
losses has prompted the forma-
tion of an AS vending machines 
task force. 

Previously the commissions 
from vending machine sales of 
sort drinks, candy and pastry, 
which amounted to $48,000 this 
year, were given to the four 
college governments to run 
student programs. 

In a story in this week's AS 
Bulletin . Revelle AS repre-

sentative Nancy Laga attacked 
the decision, claiming that its 
"consequences are very threat-
ening," and tbat it shows the 
" gross lack of consistent 
financial policy at UCSD." 

According to Sisco. a $120,000 
deficit revealed in a Housing 
and Food Services report late 
last year prompted the funding 
change. The deficit exists, said 
Sisco, because of soaring labor 
costs and the existence of 
"more facilities than would be 
economically optimum." 

The Food Service report 
showed the Coffee Hut to be the 
largest money loser, closely 
followed by the Winzer Com-
mons and the Scripps lunch 
room. said Sisco. Other faelli-

ties, such as the Revelle 
and the Muir Five and Dime, 
either broke even or made 
profit, Sisco said. 

Since University regulations 
make it illegal to permanently 
run campus services in the red, 
said Sisco, several options were 
explored to reverse the debt. 
Sisco said he decided 
reappropriate the vendi 
machine revenues back to 
Services rather than close 
of the snack bars or raise thei 
prices. 

"We recognize," said Sisco, 
"tha t in dOing this the profit 
that previously was allocated to 
college activities will have to 
otherwise funded. 

(Plt'as .. turn 10 page 

By Ka&IIy Hillier 
.. Many people are turned o(f 

when they bear tbe word 
·feminist.' They think we're a 
group of a,grelllve, pushy 
women when In actuality we're 
just a group of individuals 
dedicated toward a common 
goal - sexual equality ... 

Tbus, Sharon Baum,arten 
asserted her defense o( the 
Women's Center. Women are 
attracted to the Center; she 
said. because "It gives women 
a cbance to talk. Some," she 
remarked. "come out o( curi-
osity or a need to go someplace. 
Where else can women as a 
group ,et together? The 
lounges are inadequate and 
there are no other places on 
campus where women can talk 
freely about everything. It is 
very important as a center." 

Despite funding problems 
and transitional changes. the 
Women's Center is a popular 
spot for many students this 
qualter, according to Linda 
Rufing. a work-study member 
of the Center. 

Rufing, a new addition to the 
Center's staff this year. said 
that the most successful aspect 
of the Center has been its 
community atmosphere. 
"Women can come into the 
Center," Rufing explained, 
"and- always find someone to 
talk to. We have an average of 
20-25 women come into the 
Center daily, who orten stop by 
in their free time just to sit 
down and talk." 

Located in the Student Cen-
.t.o-~'hc WVIIIe'll'S ceaner oIfcnJ 
students a variety of infor-
mation, ranging from health 
care tips to lesbian issues. "We 
receive about five phone calls a 
day." Rufing said, "asking for 
all types o( information. We 
keep the Center filled with 
health care, abortion, political, 
day care, lesbian, job, rape and 
pregnancy information, as well 
as a library of books." 

Durilll the day women can be 
seen relaxing on one of the 
Center's couches with a cup of 
corree in hand. Ruling said that 
discussions are varied and 
often lively. and women rarely 
hesitate in voicing an opinion. 
"Often enoUgh women come in 
at one time," Rufilll said. "to 
form an informal 'rap ,roup.' 
It's probably one of our strolll-
est points." 

The organization, according 
to Rufina, iJI a "cooperative 
effort" and nm entirely by 
students. Rufin, is the only 
work-study member of tbe 
Center. She explained that the 
Center is staffed by women on a 
volunteer basla. "Anyooe wbo 
wants can staff." Rufing said • 
.• as lon, a. tbey have the 
in terest. " 

Begun in 1974, the Women's 
Center baa experieDced finan-
cial difficulties and IOmetirnes 
ambivalent support. It was 
allocated a staff and budaet in 
the fall of 1976 tbat was 
subiequeatJ)' canceled at the 
end of the year. The Center is 
curreDtly funded by the AS, alld 
must rely upon its volunteer 
staff and siqle work-study 
member. 

Marcy Thompson, a member 
of the Center, said that fundJIII 
has been a major problem for 
the Women's Center. "We only 
receive $200 for a phone 
extension," she said. "when 
much of our work is done by 
phone." This fall AS allocated 

$1465 to the (.;enter, and ,ranted 
it an additional $171 this past 
month. The money is used to 
cover telephone, postage . 
advertisin, and printing costs. 

Wblt first attracts women to 
the Center? One student, Liz 
Ryan, said that she went to the 
Center ori,inally "to get to 
know other women and for 
companionship." Ryan des-
cribed the group's atmosphere 
as heing "very warm" and said 
that friendships there are 
"easily available." 

- ,.,.,t,.' I 

Tbompson said that some 
women students may be in-
timidated by lesbian involve-
ment in the Center. "It (the 
Center) isn't necessarily 
geared toward lesbians - it 
shouldn't be - but UCSD as a 
wbole is closed to' them. wbile 
the Women's Center is sup-
portive of them." She said that 
the Center overlaps with the 
Gay Student 's Association 
(GSA). and that both hetero-
sexuals and lesbians are active 
in the Center. Wll ......... 's CeDler Is located in huildinr C of lhe Studenl Center.

UCSD Soccer Club 
Now in Full Swing 

Altboucb tbe -lDtercollqlate 
UDdel'lraduate soccer H8JOIl 
baa DOW eDded, soccer fans do 
not bave to hibernate until next 
year. Tbe UCSD soccer club, 
composed of three II-member 
teams, is now in full swiDI. 

Accorcliq to club member 
Mike EIcaD, "the soccer club is 
probably tbe oldest sporta club 
on campus, pre-ctalinl even the 
PE department." The club Is 
currently classified as an 
"intercolleliate" sport, al-
though they do not compete 
against other colleae teams. 
"One tblrd of tbe team's 
financial support cornea via the 
PE department budiet, the 
other two tbirda comes straigbt 
out of the player's pockets, 
making the soccer pro,ram the 
largest coached pro,ram at 
UCSD with the lowest coat per 

player per ,ame of any funded 
sport," saya Elcan. 

"The purpo.e of our club is to 
play IOeCer, which we do rather 
well," lauded Elcan. The first 
and secood teama are unde· 
Ceated ancllead their divlaions. 
The third team is in fourth 
place, two lames below the 
division leader, and having a 
willDina season. "We play for 
fun," Elcan added, "but 
winning is okay, too." 

Elcan empbaaized that the 
team does not discriminate 
against women, ,raduate 
students, forellD students, or 
even faculty/staff members. 
"We're really an extramural 
sports club of the European 
style," remarked Elcan. "Our 
teams are entered in the San 
Diego County Soccer League, 

wbicb in tum is part of the 
California Soccer Association 
(South), whicb is part of the 
United States Soccer Federa· 
tion and in turn part of the 
Federation Internatlonale de 
Football Asloclation." 

Two weekends a,o all three 
teams won their ,ames. The 
first team beat the Mesa Soccer 
Club, 4-1, the second team 
rolled over the Continental 
Assassins, 5-1, and the tbird 
team added their own 4·1 
victory over the Shamrocks to 
make it a UCSD sweep. 

Although there are no sched-
uled gamea for this holiday 
weekend, tbe three teams will 
be in action again on Sunday, 
December 3 at Warren Field 
East. Games start at 10 am, J2 
noon, and 2 pm.

Competition Tough 
For Triton Runners 
At Championships 

C 1'\1..'1 .\ II 

Running in 3S·deiree 
weatber on a soft, muddy 
course in the National NAIA 
Cross Country Cbampionsbips, 
UCSD's two top runners, Doug 
Jacobson and Pete Dolan, did 
"very well" accordin, to their 
coach, Andy Skief. 

Skief accompanied the pair to 
Wlaconain last Saturday .. they 
competed a,ainat 400 other 
runners in lbe national flnall. 
Jacobloa finished 147th with a 
time "around 27 minutes." His 
season', beat time was 21: 15. 
Dolan completed the course In 2. minutes, earnln, 214tb 
overall. South Ore,on's Kelly 
Jenson won the race in 25: 07, In 
wbat was termed a "slow 
course." 

"Everyone's time was about 
a minute slower than last 
year," explained Skier. "The 
course is not on roads or dirt 
trails, but rather on open fields 
which were mowed down to 
remove the brush. 

"Considering all these ob-
stacles, I think Pete and Doug 
did really well. I'm ,lad that 
both of them were able to go and 
compete in this national cbam-
pionship." 

Competition was tou,h in tbe 
championship race. Only one 
runner from UCSD's district 
(District 111) finished 1n the top 
SO. "He was from Azusa Pacific 
and they only manaled to finish 
18tb at a whole team," sider 
explained. 

The cross country season 
officially ended with the 
national meet but work has 
already belun for UCSD's 
track and field aeason. The 
track schedule stam in early 
February and runs through 
June. UCSD has an excellent 
chance to be one ofthe top three 
teams In the district. Coach 
Skief encourages anyone in· 
terested in competing to 
contact him (452-4211) or come 

. to a pra,ctice at Muir Field, 
Monday thru Friday at 3 pm.

Swimmers Break las Vegas Records 
By Karen Hunter 

S ...... E ....... 
UCSD's women's swim team 

went on a road trip to Las Ve,as 
last weekend and managed to 
come back six records ricber 
after swimming against a 
strong UN Las Velas squad. 

The women broke six scbool 
records and tied on~, bringinl 
the season total after only three 
meets to 10 new records . 
Despite tbe record·setting 
performances UCSD still lost 
the meet, 92·39. 

Apparently Las Vegas has 

done. some recruiting since last 
year when tbey had a team 
composed of five girls. Eleven 
girl, comprise this year's 
squad, including seven on 
scbolarshlps. 

"I knew they would be 
, strong," remarke~ Dianna 

Dann, the UCSD sWIm coach, 
"but I didn't think they would 
be as strong as they were. I 
didn't know about their scholar· 
ships and recruitment. " 

Andria Wolfe, Janet Park-
inson, Shawn Blaisdell, and 
Susan Zneimer, with a 2: 04.79, 

set a new school record in the 
200-yard medley relay. The old 
record, set by Wolfe, Thomp-
son, Losito, and Smith in 1977 
was two seconds slower. 

Saturday was a lucky day for 
Claudia O'Brien and Janet 
Parkinson who set two in-
dividual records apiece. In the 
200 yard freestyle event 
O'Brien broke Nadine Thoms-
son's old record of 2: U .S with a 
new time of 2: OS.S. She also 
cinched E. Sinay's old 100 yard 
freestyle record of 58.7 with a 
58 .6. O'Brien 's new time was

Eight points were picked up 
in the diving event with Lori 
Demshki placing first and 
Blaisdell second. UNLV's diver 
was excused from the meet due 
to the fact that she was the 
school's homecoming queen. 

Dann said that she was 
" pretty happy about breaking 
all those school records." She 
did feel , however, that although 

UNLV had " great facilities" 
there were two adverse vari· 
abies affecting her swimmers. 

" The water temperature in 
their enclosed pool was be· 
tween 80 and 82 degrees. We felt 
like we were in a sauna. That 
made us really mellow the 
whole day. We just weren't 
used to it. " Dann also added 
that the " inconsistency of the 
electronic timing system 
combined with the starter 
threw us off on our starts." 

The first two home meets or 
the season for both the women's 
and the men's swim teams will 
be .next Friday and Saturday, 
December 1 and 2. On Friday 
afternoon at 3: 30 the teams 
compete in the Heartland Swim 
Association Invitational. A 
nonscoring event, the invita· 
tional involves seniors from 
area high schools in competi· 
tion against the UCSD teams. 
On Saturday at 1 pm Pomona 
Pitzer enters the pool to take on 
a fired up UCSD squad, in the 
big meet of the season for the 
women.

The Triton volleyball team 
fell short in -their last game of 
the season Monday night 
against top regional contender, 
University of San Diego. The 
young team lost the match, 9-
IS, 8-15, 15-2 and 17-15; never-
theless Coach Grace Green-
burg is pleased with the year's 
performances and predicts 
overall improvement for next 
year. 

The volleyball team was also 
unable to come up with a single 
victory in three matches last 
week . Dominguez Hills 
managed to slip past the 
Tritons, 11)-15, 11-15 and 15-11 in 
Saturday night's competition.

"We played very well and made 
less errors than in previous 
games ," commented Green-
burg, "Everybody was moving 
for the ball." Cheryl Wright 
was commended for her stand-
out performance against DH. 

Having two injured players, 
UCSD couldn't overcome a 
strong offensive drive by 
Bakersfield Friday afternoon 
and faltered 11-15, UH5 and 13-
15. Many of the players feel the 
lack of concentration was a 
major factor in the match. "We 
weren't playing up to par," 
concluded one team member. 
This game marked the second 
loss against Bakersfield during 
the season. 

"It just was not a good night 
for any of us. We weren't very 
successful," explained Green-
burg after Wednesday night's 
upset against Grossmont. 
Coming up with only one game, 
the Tritons were defeated in 
their match, 3-15, 3-15, 15-6 and 
5-15. 

Even with this season'.s 
disappointments, Greenburg is 
anxious to begin next year's 
traioln,. "This was our build-
ing year," she explained. "The 
returning crew will have 
gained experience and team 
cohesion . " Cheryl Wright, 
Sherri Lilley and Beth Prather 
are among the top players that 
will be returning next year. 

Wright, captain of this year's 
squad , was awa rded " most 

valuable player" by Green-
burg . With her consistent 
performances during the 
season and her leadership, she 
is praised by all her teammates 
as the top player this year. 
Lilley's height has contributed 
to her volleyball abilitiy and 
added to many of the team's 
successes. As a returning 
sophomore she is also en-
thusiastic about next Sl!ason. 
Ann Ishihara, October's 
Athlete 01 the Month, holds the 
most impressive record of this 
season, with her all-around 
setting and net play. . 

Finally, in the men's "C"

Levenworth destroyed Peter 
Chang, 8-1. The consolation title 
went to Andy De Meyer who

Micro-Sculpture 
On Display 
In Mandeville 

By Joeepll Reiner 
The Mandeville Gallery is 

currently housing a varied 
mixture of miniature scale 
pieces in a show entitled MIcro-
SculplUre. Tbe works of nine 
artists from acroa the country 
have been gathered for a show 
in whicb the majority of work ~ 
united by the common treat-
ment of buildings as subject 
matter. Strange interiors and 
exteriors are presented and the 
viewer searches for an ex-
planation for these abandoned 
tableaux. Everyday buildings 
(a subway entrance, an old 
wooden bouse) are given a 
statuesque treatment forcing 
the viewer into meditation on 
the psychological experience 
of these edifices as objects. 

One work, "Industrial Floor 
Pieces" by Ira Joel Haber, 
consists of eight small scenes 
laid out on the floor below the 
viewer. In each of these scenes 
burned out model-railroad 
buildings are set in cold singed-
looking Landscapes. From the 
an impression is given that we 
are viewing these devastated 
sites from a plane, or that we 
are giants staring down on 
some shrunken parallel world. 
Pervading the piece is a sense 
of cancerous doom. The con-
sistent appearance of the 
withered, blackened, plastic 
implic" Ie,"" .. physico I than 
spiritual disaster; a low ebb in 
this civilization which is viewed 
in remote numbed silence. In 
scientific research the minia-
ture world or microcosm is 
used so that factors can be 
controlled and pure effects 
studied; in this work the artist 
seems to be investigating a 
personal and conceptual level 
of alienation and confronting 
the viewer with that ex-
perience. 

Mounted on the wall opposite 
this work are three elegant 

constructions by Roland Reiss. 
Each portrays a room filled 
with ' pleasingly miniature 
objects which look as if some 
tiny people abandoned them 
and left the room just a few 
moments before our viewing. 
Reiss's fascination with con-
struction is obvious - even the 
floor joists are carefully 
fashioned and visible. Var-
nished woodwork and ritzy 
colors suuest the house in-
teriors of the jet set. The 
gorgeous adult's dollhouse 
appearance of his work make it 
easy to understand why be has 
a large buying demand for 
these pieces. These rooms' are 
boxed in polished plexiglass 
and are so crowded with objects 
(railings, pianos, and, in a 
surreal joke, an artists studio 
with a full size miniature palm 
tree) that passage seems 
realistically impossible. As in 
Haber's sculpture, with its 
suspiciously controlled burn 
damage, the viewer is again 
presented with a world, which, 
aside from its size, contains 
logical flaws. They suggest a 
hidden psychological content 
underneath the easily ap-
proachable facade of the 
pieces. 

Other work in the show 
includes Theodore Halkin 's 
sculptures of his house. The 
firat, Howle , I, Is made of 
yellowed paper tape which has 
a nice beat up old housish feel to 
it. After remodeling his house. 
Halkin did a second sculpture of 
the building. This one is larger 
and rigidly contructed of match 
sticks - the front porch has 
been walled in. The sculptor is 
dealing with a building which 
has the fundamental relation-
ship to him of serving as his 
home. By creating a miniature 
one can relate to large objects 
in, if not a more equal way, at 
least a new and perhaps more 
possessing way. 

Ferry's 'Bride' 
Is First Class 
The Bride S&ripped Bare 
Bryan Ferry 
(Atlantic) 

The UCSD Sex Clinic should 
keep a copy of Bryan Ferry's 
new album on hand at all times 
as a kind of audio symptom 
catalogue. The Bride Stripped 
Bare obsessively focuses upon 
sexual breakdown, emotional 
compulsions and anxieties , 
frigidity as the price of overin-
dulgence. The songs are about 
love and romance, but "I Can't 
Smile Without You " they 
definitely aren 't. 

Ferry is a star of sorts in 
Britain , a cult hero in the U.S. 
As both vocalist for the crit-
ically-acclaimed Roxy Music 
band and as a solo artist Ferry 
has played the role of the jaded 
but still love-hungry gigolo to 
the hilt. Fascinated yet re-
pulsed by the twisted ways of 
modern courtship, this fallen 
aristocrat sings like a man 
undergoing ice-bath therapy 
alternated with direct electric 
stimuli to the lower abdomen , 

murmuring tales of heartache 
in a wobbly. fragile vibrato. A 
vivid yet strangely ambiguous 
lyricist, Ferry's songs on Bride 
counterpoint overly sweet 
poetic imagery ("Here is a 
rainbow for your hair ...... ) with 
a world-weary attitude (We 're 
cut but we don't care.") They 
portray an intellectual coming 
to grips with his rampant 
libido . . Freud could've written 
an encyclopedia about Bryan 
Ferry. 

But what about the music? 
It's streamlined , first-class 
rock 'n' roll. In one of the most 
unlikely combinations since 
Phil Spector collaborated with 
Leona rd Cohen last yea r , 
guitarist Waddy Wachtel and 
drummer Rick Marotta. L.A. 
studio musicians who normally 
work with' the likes of Linda 
Ronstadt and her country rock 
cohorts. teamed-up with 
English aesthete Ferry to 
produce Bride. Ferry hasn ' t 
compromised himself by work-

Troupe Performs Farce 
Dancers Poke Fun at Classical Ballet 

By Monet Payton 
The curtains part and reveal 

beautiful moonlit scenery. A 
splendidly costumed figure 
(the evil wizard, played by 
Ludmflla Bolshoya, alias Tom 
Heskett) rises from the stage 
and begins to "dance. " Eventu-
ally swans prance onto the 
stage, supposedly the epitome 
of grace and elegance. How-
ever, after about 30 seconds one 
realizes that underneath the 
swan costumes are a bunch of 
floundering ducks with epi-
lepsy. 

Les Ballets Trockadero de 
Monte Carlo appeared in 
Mandeville Auditorium 
Wednesday night to an audi-
ence lucky enough to get tickets 
before the show sold out. The 
audience was not disappointed. 
From Swan Lake Act II to Don 
Quixote this ballet trouPe made 
a farce out of classical ballet. 
The conscientiously arranged 
fingers and carefully flexed 
feet were designed to make a 
ballerina cringe. 

Oddly enough the troupe 
hasn't as yet gotten much flack 
from classical ballet aficio-
nados. Said Natch Taylor. one 
of the dancers and co-ori-
ginator of the company, "Some 
people will get upset with what 
we do, but I think their biggest 
problem is that they 're frus-
trated dancers who never made

Singer/songwriter Laura 
Zambo will be performing at

Accompanying herself on

toire includes blues , jazz, folk 
and rock numbers from the '30s 
through the '70 . Her excellent

it...the people who really know 
ballet and are on top of it really 
love the company." 

The performance went 
smoothly, covering lip the few 
technical mistakes with humor-
ous finesse. Some of the timing 
was off and a few of the 
gestures fell nat, but in general 
the show was excellent. 

By starting off with Swan 
Lake Act II , Trockadero played 
their trump card in humor. 
Peculiar choreography makes 
one wonder why Russian swans 
are doing a Scottish reel (pun 
intended) , but the effect is 
hilarious . 

Phaedra/ Monotonous 1148 
was their second ballet. This is 
a good name for it . Zamarina 
Zamarkova , alias William 
Zamora, was outstanding as 
The Outsider, presenting an 
intricate picture of vacillating 
woebegonity. 

In Yes Virginia, Another 
Piano Ballet, Natalia Zlotma-
chinskaya, aka Keith Glancy, 
was especially appealing as 
she/he was alternately pushed, 
pulled and carried across the 

stage. He then did a series of 
steps a la Shirley Temple and 
Liza Minelli combined. 

Finishing up with Don 
Quixote , Trockadero finally 
achieved their goal in having 
the audience actually pay 
attention to the story, instead of 
just waiting for the next funny 
movement. 

According to Natch Taylor, 
there is a lot more involved in 
doing this kind of ballet than in 
doing straight classical ballet. 

" Inste·ad of just rehears-
ing the steps straight, the 
timing , the humor ~nd the 
gestures have to be continually 
rehearsed to keep it so it looks 
like it's fresh , and so it's always 
on time." 

They are one of the few all-
male ballets who do much of 
their work on point. " I just put 
on toe shoes and ... as far asjust 
knowing what to do, and that 
difference of feeling of being up 
there, rather than flat - it's 
strange, but if you want to 
dance in the company, you just 
have to do it."

Arts . 
'Hot Child' is 
Asexual Fluff 
Blandness' at Its Best 

'"By Mikel Toombs 

"Hot Child in the City" 
Nick Gilder (Chrysalis). 

The pop music industry is 
fascinated by charts - the Top 
40s, the Hot 100s - and its 
artists live- and die by them. 
Pop music critics, though 
(especially those who write for 
The Guardian) . often ignore the 
charts, prefen-ing to track 
down the elusive "aesthetics of 
rock," an undertaking they see 
as more challenging and more 
rewarding . But the chart 
success of a song is sometimes 
mQre interesting than its 
artistic success (or failure) ; 
what the work of art reveals 
about its audience may be more 
important than what it reveals 
about its creator. 

" Hot Child in the City" is an 
interesting song and an im-
portant one. The first hit for 
Canadian Nick Gilder, it 
surprised nearly everyone by 
rising to the top of every pop 
chart in the country. At first 
listen it seems a simplistic 
piece of jailbait pop, but upon 
closer inspection it takes on 
many intriguing dimensions. 

So young 10 be loose 
And 0'1 her o ... n 
Young boys. lhey all ... anl 
To lake her home 
She goes downlown 
The boys all SlOp and Slare 
When she comes dOWn/own 
She acts like she just don't care 
Hot Child in thl! City .. . 

The song is sexually charged 
but somehow innocent- no, not 
innocent; " innocuous" is more 
like it. Adolescent sex, without 
sophistication, without compli-
cations - the most obvious 

parallel is with the new wave of 
television programming, the 
Charlie's Angels's, the Three's 
Company's: leering titilation 
on a 12-yea r -old (perhaps 
generous) mental level. These 
programs are not necessarily 
blatant about their sexual 
exploitation - just as "Hot 
Child" is not as immediately 
obvious as many recent bump 
and grind disco songs ("songs" 
may also be generous) - but 
certainly subtlety is not one of 
their strong points. Imagina-
tion and talent are also not 
among thtiTr qualities but , 
judging by the enormou:.; 
popularity of some of the 
shows. a lot of people don 't 
care. What is being given - and 
readily accepted - is di -
verting unchallenging , 
thoughtless "entertainment. .. 
It is, in a word , innocuous; in a 
better word. bland. 

" Hot Child in the City " 
carries blandness. to an ex-
treme. While the lyrics can be 
perceived as clever, the music 
cannot. As produced by the 
ubiquitous Mike Chapman, the 
music is a cross between 
bubblegum and hardrock, 
carefully stripped of the 
potentially abrasive elements 
of each. The result is simple, 
controlled, inoCfensive product. 

Perhaps most surpnsmg In 
the success of "Hot Child" is 
the listener's acceptance of 
Nick Gilder's vocals: he easily 
has the most androgynous 
voice on the airwaves. There is 
essentially no sign of sexual 
orientation one way or another 
in his voice, and Gilder doesn't 
seem to make any attempt at 
delineation . His personal 
sexuality is open to question, as 
is its appeal to the listener, but 
one thing is clear: Ultimately, 
Gilder's asexual approach to 
" Hot Child in the City" is just 
one more contribution to its 
blandness.

with the Assembly sub-com-
mittee in the Urey Room of 
Urey Hall. 

Two UCSD professors, as yet 
undetermined, will also speak. 

Physics Professor William 
Frazer, one of those meeting 
with Vasconcellos Thunday, ' 
said the faculty's main goal is 
to " make him (Vasconcellos) 
aware of the damage to the 
University if some of the severe 
buqet cubi beil18 talked about 
actually happen." UCSD Pro-
fesor RUBS Doolittle is also 
expected to attend, alol18 with 
six professors Crom other UC 
campuses, Frazer said. 

Prop-ams iD Need 
Kolpin, a "Tenure Project" 

memfler, said tile AS Academic 
Affairs Commission'S major 
goal is to prop up the interdis-
ciplinary programs at UCSD 
and hopes his testimony at the 
hearings will aid in this goal. 

Interdisciplinary programs 
deal with an area of study from 
a multi-<iiscipline perspective, 
such as the Communications 
Program. A department, on the 
other hand, looks at numerous 
areas from basically the same 
perspective or starting point. 

Presently, Kolpin says , 
interdisciplinary programs 
must hire their proCessors 
under the auspices of other 
departments, an example 
being a Communications pro-
fessor hired thl'OUlh the Soci-
0101>' or Anthropolol>' Depart-
ments. 

Kolpin is worried because 
"departments aren't making a 
commitment to areas outside oC 
their discipline. They want the 
full-time employee, and don't 
like it when they have to split it 
with another program." 

He also said that budget cuts 
currently considered by the 
Univenity Administration 
would harm interdisciplinary 
programs, and that "the 
programs aren't really work-
ing to hire their own faculty." 

T.he student goal of the 
hearings, Kolpin said, is to 
"take all programs and put 
them under one house because 
they're harder to attack that 
way ... We want them to be in a 
position to hire their own 
faculty." 

Third College, home of most 
of the interdilCiplinary pro-
graml, including Communica-
tions and Urban and Rural 
Studies, will be having a dinner 
meeting with Vasconcellos 
Thursday night. Presentations 
from various programs and 
College staff will hllhlight the 
dinner. 

Invitations to the dinner were 
limited by the College Council : 

only 25 students were invited 
alol18 with similar number of 
faculty and staff. 

The hearings will also deal 
with the eight-year tenure rule , 
retention of lecturers and 
faculty involvement in student 
recruitment and retP.ntion.

largely unsupervised ," said 
Ruda. 

Another direct result of being 
overcrowded was the unsani-
tary condition of the Center, 
said Ruda, adding, :'Caring for 
the children, including chang-
ing diapers, preventing fights, 
etc., took precedence over 
cleaning up. As a result, loose 
materials from the play areas 
tended to pile up on the floor." 

SbuidoWD Tbreatened 
In the S pring of 1976 the 

California FIre Marshall's 
office said they were going to 
close the Center because it was 
in violation of state fire and 
safety codes. The Center, which 

was then under the 'auspices of 
the Office of Student Affairs, 
was taken over by the Business 
Office, where sufficient funding 
was obtained to renovate the 
Center and bring it up to the 
state fire and safety standards. 

In meeting the state stan-
dards the Center was forced to 
reduce the number of children 
enrolled in the Center from 50 to 
32. With less children, however, 
the teacher-to-child ratio was 
low enough to enable the Center 
to apply for funding from the 
State Department of Education 
(SDE) . According to Ruda, 
SDE funding currently " pro-
vides 75 percent of the funds for 
the operation." 

New Nightclub 
To Open in Jan 

By Jobn Hondros 
Associate New. Editor 

"Things are looking good" 
for the AS sponsored nightclub 
scheduled to open winter 
quarter in the Student Center, 
according to the Programming 
Commissioner Melanie AI-
schueler. 

On the other.. hand, program-
ming speakers and performing 
artists at UCSD is "extremely 
frustrating" this year due to the 
problems of limited space and 
funds, said Alschueler. 

" We're aiming for something 
like the Backdoor (SDSU's 
nightclub) ," said Alschueler. 
The nightclub will be located in 
building C - where Future 
Foods is located - and is 
advertised as "UCSD's only 
club with a coffee house 
atmosphere - where small 
entertaining events are con-
tinually happening." 

If okayed , explained AI-
schueler, ':he pub will be in 
building C .il o. She said the AS 
is aiming t.~ et a liquor license, 
where anJ,fO e can enter the 
premises, bllt only those with 
the prope identification can 
purchase t~e liquor . " This 
won't limit the audience, " said 
Alschueler, dding that "this is 
one more ~tback about San 
Diego - uflless you're 21, 
you're left out." 

Accordir.g to Alschueler, a 
major goa of building C will be 
to "create an audience trust" in 
the live entertainment, which 
will consist mainly of local 
talents. Live entertainment 
will be featured at least once a 
week, and tickets will be priced 
around one dollar, she said. 

The budget request for a 
stage, lighting and sound 
system for building C was 
approved by the Student Center 
Board, and now has to go 
through the Graduate Students 
Council, explained Alschueler. 
The AS initially planned to open 
building C this quarter, but 
" what held us back was the red 
tape," she said. " We will be 
open regardless on Jan. 12," 

Bringing speakers and per-
forming artists on campus has 
been a problem this year, 
according to Alschueler. 

"The only place to hold 
events is the gym, which only 
holds 2,200, and the PE de-
partment doesn 't want to give it 
up." 

"The times are real spora-
dic," continued Alschueler . 
" They give us one date , then we 
see who's available and try to 
figure out who we want." 

Alschueler said there is a lot 
of competition from the thea-
ters around town . "The pro-
moters would rather have the 
artists in theaters than here ... 
Besides, artists are expensive 
and we have a limited budget. " 

The AS had the gym con-
tracts set this quarter to have 
Jane Fonda speak, according to 
Alschueler, "but her agent 
called back and said they 
needed $500 more," The AS 
cancelled Fonda because they 
" felt students were being taken 
advantage of." 

Concerning funds, from the 
$200,833 AS budget. $11,149 goes 
toward programming. 

Cocaine City 
B, Rod ... SalHv .. 

ud 
MApel Perez 

For TIle Aaoela&ed Preu 
NEW YORK - Cocaine people, police call 

them, as if they were a new species - mutants 
of the modem era's greed and corruption. 

In Jackson Heights, a once-quiet neighbor-
hood in the New York City borough of Queens, 
these nervous, furtive men - mostly 
Colombians - do an estimated $1 billion trade 
in cocaine each year. 

But they are not like Harlem's nashy heroin 
dealers. They wear their bullet-proof vests 
under cheap luits. They drive aging cars 
blocks out of the way to buy discount gasoline 
as they head to six-figure deals that will fatten 
their seven-figure bank accounts. . 

They live in modest apartments, protecting 
an almost standardized range of possessions: 
6-10 pounds of cocaine with street value of up to 
$350,000, wads of $50,000 to $100,000 in twenty· 
dollar bills, arsenals of weapons - and little 
black books in which they jot $60 spent on a 
used TV in red ink next to a $1 million sale in 
black ink. 

This picture emerges from a month-long 
Associated Press inquiry in Jackson Heights, 
which police call the U .S. capital of cocaine. 
Even cocaine shipped through the major entry 
point of Miami is sent here first to be cut before 
it goes back south for sale on the street. 

Twenty-seven murders in the area in two 

ye.... have been linked to cocaine trade. A 
curious business resurg4mce has seen real 
estate offices, notaries and travel agents 
spring up to serve the dealers. Those at 
neighborhood meelinls talk not only about 
crime and dirty streets but about foreign 
reiations - what is beiDi done by the United 
States and Colombia to stem the cocaine tide? 

Tbe dealers - a tiny minority of Colombians 
here - "can easily accept the necessity of a 
murder or two" to protect the business that has 
taken them out of poverty, one federal agent 
says. 

Despite the violence, the dealers remain 
inconspicuous. One's American girlfriend says 
of him: "Tito is probably the only millionaire 
in New York who looks more like a garaae 
mechanic. " 

The dealers keep several apartmentS - and 
identities - to stay ahead otpolice. They fold 
themselves into the Latin community - some 
200,000 Colombians and thousands of other 
Latins live in Jackson Heights - and use the 
new neighborhood businesses to maintain 
apartments, false IDs and a schedule of trips 
back to Colombia. 

There is another reason for the dealers' 
modest lives. They are greedy, explains an 
agent. "If they should, for instance, move the 
cocaine into the country inside a shipment of 
canned goods, they will remove the specially 
marked cans with the coke in them, then sell 
the rest of the shipment.. .at a profit."

Service Students Return 
By Teresa Tokar 

The birth of the American 
Field Service Returnees Group 
occurred at San Diego State 
University last weekend . 

Tom Lathan, who is active in 
organizing the group, said: 
" We're in a preliminary stage. 
We would like to find out how 
many returnee students are 
interested in getting together 
and doing something produc-
tive for AFS." Added Paul 
Martin, another participant in 
the organization of the group, 
" I got interested in (forming 
the group) because there i n't 
that much communication 
betwen AFS returnees." 

According to Lathan, the 
basic goal of the AFS returnees 
group will be " helping out 
returnees . Just having this 
group will be a support for 
people who come back ." 
Martin added: " Jusl having a 
social club is important be· 
cause the majority of returnees 
feel a bond of going through the 
sart}e experiences." 

According to Martin, another 
aim of the group will be to, "get 
involved in a more regional 
level to help sol\'(! . orne of the 

problems of AFS." Currently, help meet the costs of sending 
the main problem of AFS is the students abroad. Lathan feels 
inflated cost of sending stu- that the club needs much 
dents abroad. Martin hopes support and that some of the 
that the club will eventually best qualified for this are the 
have fund raising activities to AFS returnees.
