DA VIS, CA - The University 
of California established the 
Faculty Disciplinary Proce-
dures Task Force to review its 
disciplinary process in 
response to numerous com-
plaints about its handling of 
sexual harassment charges 
against faculty members. Jim 
Holst of the UC Genenl 
Counsel wrote that UC's 
current policy could leave the 
university vulnerable to lawsuit 
because of lengthy delays, 
dropping of cases on technical 
grounds and refusal to inform 
complainants of litigation 
outcomes. 

RIVERSIDE, CA - Student 
and faculty researchers al UC 
Riverside's Center for Environ-
mental Research and Technol-
ogy designed and tested two 
cars that effectively run on 
water. Both cars are fueled by 
hydrogen, which IS obtained 
fro m water through the process 
of electrolysis. One of the cars 
uses a modified gasoline 
cngine which works as a 
hydrogen burner and releases 
water and minimal amounts of 
nitrogen oxides. The other car 
runs on a hybrid fuel cell 
which emits only water. The 
greatest barriers to the com-
mercial success of cars is the 
fuel availability and cost.

LOS ANGELES - The 
incidence of whooping cough, 
a highly contagious bacterial 
disease known to be fatal in 
young children, is higher in 
adults than once believed, 
according to a recent UCLA 
study. Although .the disease 
poses a considerable threat to 
children, adult symptoms 
typically include only an 
annoying, recurring cough. The 
study was conducted on 51 
health-care workers.

The California electorate joined 
the nation in sending a message of 
conservatism Tuesday, voting 
greatly in favor of Republican can-
didates and GOP-backed initiatives. 

Brown captured 40.5 percent of 
the electorate after leading by as 
much as 23 points in a Field Poll 
taken last summer. Brown 's cam-
paign was criticized for lacking fo-
cus, losing ground under Wilson 's 
focus on crime and immigration is-
sues.

UCSD students trickled into campus 
polls Tuesday, cuting votes in a series

According to Marshall junior Scott

election, Republicans received the brunt 
of the negative campaigning. 

"Most of the mud-slinging was bal-

Republicans expected a rout in their

UC Should Stop Its Anti-
Union Campaign 

During the Vietnam WII, radic:allctivists attacked the University of 
California for its development of military weaponry and its general 
collusion in "imperialism" abroad. Such criticism, while often hypelbolic, 
signals an important fact about the university: Though its mission to 
educate the public and advance the Ills and sciences may be noble, the UC 
is not necessarily immune to business and political interests. 

Membersofthe Union of Professional andTcdlnicaI Employee(UPl'E) 
know this well. In response to a mail-in ballot election which would give 
technical employees union representation under UPTE and Communica-
tion Workers of American (CWA), the UC has launched a systemwide 
campaign to persuade employees to vote against representation. 

Currently, technical employees have the right to join unions, but 
because 00 one union represents them, they must go through university 
grievance procedures and cannot bargain collectively, giving the university 
the decisive edge. 

Fearing the election would upset the status quo, managers at virtually 
every UCcampus have mailed "00 representation" fliers to union members, 
warning them of the lIangers of UfFfE-CW A representation. One such flier, 
distributed at UCLA, went so far as to state that if employees tried to work 
during a strike, they would be caUed "scabs." At UCSD, the so<alled 
"Committee Supporting a 'No Representation' Vote," has used similll 
tactics to scare employees, pointing to the possible negative effects of a 
strike - including the loss of wages, benefits and jobs. 

UC officials claim to be giving employees the "other side of the issue." 
However, many campuses are dmtributing information which is blatandy 
false or misleading. 

This situation has not gone unnoticed. State Senate Prc:aident pro 
tempore Bill Lockyer wrote a IetIer 10 UC President Jack Peltason, which 
stated that the anti-union fliers "can certainly be iaterpreted as mislead-
ing ... ," adding that "If the universiiy cannot take a neutral position in this 
election ... I urge that you at least consider cancelli ng any further mailings. .. 

These sentiments were echoed in a letter to Peltason by State Senator 
Nick Petros as well as an Oct. 21 letter by Democrat!c Repraentadve Ron 
Del/ums. In the letter, he stated that he was "deeply concerned fly what 
appears to be a systematic effort by management at the various campuses 
to persuade voters to oppose the union."DeUums added that "Jbc university's 
participation in an aggressive anti-union campaign is. .. unecessary and, in 
my view, inappropriate. I do not understand why highly compensated labor 
relations professionals would tolerate, let alone condone, a campaign baed 
on distortion and misinformation .... " 

As union leaders have pointed out, the university not only has a moral 
obligation to stop its campaign, but may actually have a legal obligation to 
do so. According to Daniel Martin, director of UPTE at UCSD, the 
university managers have been using the university mail system to distrib-
ute anti-union literature while denying the same right to union mernbqs. 

The UC's ladics, however reprehensible they may be, are not surpris-
ing. The UfFfE election, which will continue through Nov. ] 5, threatens to 
level the playing field of the university. Califomiansshould demand that the 
University of California begins living up to its noble goals.

THE DRINKING DOUBLE-STANDARD

For the majority of young adults in 
the United States, the issue is not a 
laughing matter. It is a part of every-
day life. 

Because the law treats 18-year-
olda as adults in many ways-bold-
ing them responsible for the oblip-
tion of marriage and lupporting chil-
dren, paying debts, signing legally 
binding documents, charging them 
u adults in court and drafting them 
into the military in tima of war-it 
should allow for some liberties a 
well. However, these liberties are 
few and fll between. 

It is this blatant contradiction in 
reasoning which forms the epicen-
ter of debate on the issue. 

"How can any ratioaal person 
commission an individual to decide 
when it is necessary to kill another 
human being, but find him too im-
mature to decide whether to drink a 
beer or wine in an orderly society?" 
askedTriaityCoUeaePresideatTom 
Gerety, in. receat WIIll St1'eeIJOfIr-
1ItI' column. 

Just 10 yean ago, 27 stata al-
lowed people under 21 to purchase 
alcohol. Four yean later, all man-
dated that legal drinking age is 21. 

Why such a quick tun around? 
Based on • recommendation by the 
Presideatial CoJllDliuion on Drunk 
Drivinlo under President Reapn, 
CongJell pused the National Mini-
mum Drinking Age Amendment in 
1984, which withheld 10 percent of 
all federal highway funds from Iny 
states which were uDwilling to com-
ply with a minimum drinking age of 
2] . States such as Texa would stand 
10 lose $100 millioa annually. 

In an interview with the Wa.rh-
iltglOtl Post, Texas representative 
Jama M. Jeffords reacted that, "We 
need to address the national tragedy 
of drunk driving. However, I op-
pose the approach chosen by Con-
gress, becausc the American people 
Ire led to believe that Congress has 
addressed the drunk driving prob-
lem, when in fact we have devel-
oped a non-solution. More impor-
tant, it uaurps the rights specifICally 
reserved for ltates in the 211t 
Amendment" In 1987, arguments 
such as this brought the issue to the 
.ttention of the Supreme Court in 
SouIJt DtJkolII v. Dole. 

Although the statute was held to 
be constitutional under the General 
Welfare C1ausc of the Constitution 
by a 7-2 majority, several very im-
portant points were made. One sena-
tor stated that "84 percent of all 
highway fatalitia involving alco-
hol cx:cur among those wbqse aga 
exceed 21." Dissenting, Justice 
O'Connor stated, "The courts com-

Alnerlcans drink 
to get drunk, 
while Europeans 
lOCIally sip their 
drinks .. a 
pastime, often 
with their 
famlll ... 
pliance in this infringement on state 
privileges ... is lamentable. Not only 
is tbe clear inteitt of the 21st Amend-
ment ignored, but the methods cho-
sen to coen:e the states also f.i1 to 
properly address the problem." 

This bill also passed because it 
was aD election year, and the drink-
ina issue provided perfectcampaign 
material. The political safe ground 
entailed protecting the majority of 
highway druaks, while wrongly 
ac:cuaing those "underage" of being 
the main cause of drunk driving 
deatha. 

From • social standpoint, the 
current legislation finds itself on 
unstable ground. An alcohol ques-
tionnaire distributed to college stu-
dents in ] 992-93 supported the 
theory that greater amounts of alco-
hol would be consumed within the 
target population, 18 to 2] year-
oJds. in areas where the legal drink-
ingage is 21, than in areas where the 
legal age is ]8. Statistical studies 
have found that nearly 81 percent of 
underage students used alcohol, 
while only 75 percent of 'legal' 
drinkers did so. 

In addition, a recent nationwide 
study published by the National 
Council on Alcoholism found that 
"lowering the drinking age has no 
measurable effect on traffic fatali-
ties." 

Many experts today argue that 
the current drinking age encourages 
18- to 21-year-olds to drink in 
unmonitored situations, such as par-
ties or on the highway, rather than in 
a college pub or a bar. Such critics 
have cited a study which showed an 
increase in arrests for drunken driv-
ing after the minimum age was raised 
from 18to 20 in 1979. Findings such 
as this not only demonstrate the law's 
ineffectiveness against driving un-
der the influence, but suggest the 
ludicrous situation created when 
daily activities of young adults are 
pitted against the law. 

"They drink like alcoholics," said 
one college president, "in their 

rooms, in the bushes, behind the 
gym; they drink like criminals in 
secret because we punish them for 
drinking openly." And so the "sav-
ing" policy of prohibition becomes 
the perpetrator of the buying and 
selling of fake IDs, the buying of 
alcohol for underage friends, and 
most paradoxically, in border re-
gions such as southern California, 
the 45-minute drive to Tijuana to 
load up on margaritas and shots of 
tequila before driving home. 

Raising the drinking age pun-
ishes 18- to 21-year-olds without 
dealing directly with the drunkdriv-
ing problem. 

"It's pretty well established that 
laws in and of themselves do not 
change social customs," says Dr. 
Gerardo Gonzalez of the University 
of Florida. Others agree that chang-
ing laws would notchange the causes 
of adolescent drinking, which are 
symptomatic of a larger societal 
problem with alcohol consumption. 

According to Dr. Gail Milgram 
from the Center for Alcohol Studies 
at Rutgers University, part of the 
problem lies in the very labeling of 
"adolescent drinking" as "the is-
sue." Milgram said, "Treating ado-
lescent drinking as the central issue 
takes the focus off all the 35-year-
olds that have alcohol-related high-
way accidents ... [it] does something 
to ease our conscience ... and yet 
there's no positive framework es-

MUIR COUEGE COMMUTER COUNCIL 
IGNORES S11JDENTS 

EdItor: 
On Nov. 7, the Muir College 

Council passed a resolution that will 
ban smoking in the "Muir Quad 
Seating Area," which it defines as 
the moveable·tables uea in the Muir 
quad, steps around Middle of Muir 
(M.O.M.). and cement seating lrea 
in front of M.O.M. Although this 
resolution was opposed by almost 
all of the public who attended, the 
council voted for the resolution any-
way. 

Jennifer Nicoll, a sophomore 
senalOr, made one of the few intelli-
gent statements by a council mem-
ber that evening, saying that she is 
an elected official who is supposed 
to represent the students' views. She 
contended that while it might be 
good for the council to be able to 
pass the resolution, shemuldn't vote 
for i~ considering all the public's 
disapproval . 

Sluart Moskovics, the author of 
the resolution, immediately jumped 
to hisown defense, saying he didn't 
like being accused of voting for 
somelhing, which the people he 
represented do not want. He stated 
that the Muir Commuter Council 
had voted against his resolution. 
Beingthe Muir Commuter Council 
Representative to the Muir College 
Council, he should have voted 
against h is own resolution, thereby 
enforcing the will of the Commuter 
Council and those it representS. 
Instead, however, Moskovics 
served his own power-hungry pur-
poses and voted for his resolution, 
thereby v iolaling the trust of the 
commuters and the College Coun-
cil. He supported his position by 
saying that the Commuter Council 
doesn't have permanent members. 
Does this mean that any represen-
tative who isn't from a committee 
with permanent members can use 
manipulate his position to serve 
only himself? 

Moskovics also implied that his 
resolution was more imporlantthan 
Muir's Almhol Awareness Week, 
when he said, "It's easier to mini· 
mizeoontaCl with drunk driver than 
it is 10 minimize mntact with sec-
ond·hand smoke." You can walk

Given that we do live in a drink-

The most effective alcollOl-edu-

harder to spot a drunk drive.. the 
second before he kills you. Until 
Moskovics and the Muir College 
Council do a second-hand-smoke 
awareness project or attempt to edu-
cate Muir students, he has no right 
belittling the Almhol Awareness 
Week. 

Two points need to be brought 
to the attention of Muir students. 
First, the argument for passing the 
resolution was based on university 
policy, which states, "Where out-
door seating is provided adjacent to 
indoor food-services facilities, non-
smoking sections must be desig-
nated and posted." When we of-
fered a compromise, which would 
allow for smoking at the three most 
southwest tables at the quad, the 
council didn't accept it. Instead, 
the resolution prohibits smoking at 
all of the Muir quad tables. Also, 
bc<:ause Moskovics adopted a time 
schedule for non-smoking hours, 
the resolution now doesn't mmply 
with the UCSD Policy and Proce-
dure Manual (PPM), contradicting 
his whole reason for writing the 
resolution. 

The second point is that some of 
the council members stated that, 
without no-smoking sigm, people 
won't feel comfortable telling oth-
ers to stop smoking. Moskovics said 

mnstitutes social drinking, thus set-
ting a standard of acceptable alco-
hol use." Today's youth needs in-
formation, not prohibition. 

This interactive metbod seems 
to work especially well in Spain, 
France and many other countries 
where drinking is not construed as a 
sin, but rather as a putoflife. Ameri-
cans drink to get drunk, while Euro-
peans socially sip their drinks as a 
pastime, often with their flmilies. 
European youth are not told through 
law that they cannot make intelli-
gent personal decisions, as we are in 
the United States. Instead, they are 
afforded freedom married 10 respon-
sibility, a nec:essary prerequisite in 
a democratic 1OCiety. 

Echoing the belief that adubs are 
shifting culpability from themselves 
to their children, syndicated colum-
nist Ellen Goodman wrote in the 
WasltUtgtlHl Post that "Rather than 
trying 10 educate our children in 
morality, values and dccision-mak-

that while watching "Real Genius" 
in the quad during Welcome Week, 
be didn't feel comfortable telling 
the people in front of him to stop 

. smoking. 
Moskovics had federal law back-

ing him then, and he still did noth-
ing. Was there supposed 10 be I sign 
posted that stated "no smoking pot 
on the grass"? Is this Moskovics 
next project? 

Because of Stuart MOikovics' 
blatant disregard for the commuters 
Ind all Muir students, lam asking 
for his resignation from the Muir 
College Council and as the Muir 
Commuter Council Chair. He is 
obviously not representative of the 
student body. 

In addition, a formal apology to 
all commuters is necessary, but I'll 
leave that to the discretion of the 
Muir Commuter Council. I have 
mntacled members of the Muir 
CommuterCouncil who support this 
letter and the ideas within, but in the 
words of one member, they can 't 
have their names put in this letter 
because Moskovics' "little group is 
so vindictive." They will do any-
thing to get what they want.

EdItor: 

For all of you who work in the 
media: Please do America I favor 
and report the real election results 
on Election Night, not just the per· 
centages for democratic and repub-

of all voters are registered with a 
third party, yet the media never pub-
lishes results for these candidates. 
Television skews election results, 
giving the public the impression that 
only two candidates run for an of-

disservice to voters.

No one really believes that rais-
ingtbe minimum drinkingagesolves 
the problems associated with ado· 
lescent drinking. It's just I band-aid 
solution, a symptom of the "quick 
fix" mentality which has become 
synonymous with American poli-
tics. 

A difference of three years in the 
legal drinking age will not halt drink-
ing and driving. Most importantly, 
not allowing 18-year-olds to legally 
drink almhol is a blatant infringe· 
ment of the mnstitutional rights of 
full citizens of the United Slates of 
America. 

A policy respectful of 18-year· 
olds as legal Idults, extensive Ind 
comprehensive education on the 
dangers of drunk driving and strict, 
immediate penalties for first-time 
offenders is the moat directand mm-
petent reaction 10 the issue.

ContInued from .... 1 
last year in case the state's unused 
borrowable resources did not meet 
original expectations. 

If the state mntroller decides not 
10 activate the trigger, it is unlikley 
that the UC will raise fees. Fees 
would actually be lower next quar-
ter because oflast fall's decision by 
the Regents to reduce this year's fee 
increase from the original 18 per-
cent ~ 10 percent. When the deci-
sion was made, student registration 
bills had already been sent out for 

crats Deidre "Dede" Alpert and Su-
san Davis will mmplete the delega-
tion. 

Republicans William "BiII"Cra-
ven and Ray Haynes and Democrat 
Steve Peace will represent San Di-
ego County IS state senators. 

Republican U.S. mngressional 
incumbents Ron Packard, Randy 
Cunningham Ind Duncan Hunter 
and Democrat Bob Filner all glided 
10 victory, while Democratic incum-
bent Lynn Schenk was narrowly 
defeated by Brian Bilbray. No Re-
publican incumbents 100t seats as 
the GOP swept both the U.S. Senate 
and House of Representatives . 

National elections were high-
lighted by losses by Republicans 
Jeb Bush in the Florida gubernato-
rial race and Oliver North in the 
Virginia Senate race. Democratic 
Sen. Ted Kennedy of Massachu· 
setts retained his seat, while New 
York Gov. Mario Cuomo and Texas 
Gov. Ann Richards lost to Republi-
can challengers. Richards lost to 
George W. Bush, son of the former 
president. 

However, election results are not 
final, as absentee ballots turned in 
on election day have yet 10 be tabu-
lated. Voter turnout was 52.7 per-
cent, subject to change after munt-
ing absentee ballots. 

Fall Quarter, reflecting the 18 per-
cent increase for the year. To aver-
age only a 10 percent increase for 
this year, fees will be reduced for 
Winter and Spring Quarters. 

Representatives of the University 
of California Student Association 
(UCSA), however, are skeptical. "I 
don't think it's coincidental that we 
hear [this) a week before the elec-
tion, .. said UCSA Fees and Financial 
Committee Chair Naomi Falit. She 
also warned students 10 be wary of 
what might happen after Nov. 8. 

"I don't know whcther there were 
any political considerations or not," 
said Rabovsky, adding that there 
were good reasons for setting the 
deadline for the decision at Nov. 15.

Order on ProposItIon 117 

San Francisco Superior Court 
.JudCe Stuart Pollack issued a te~ 
porary restralnl~ order barri~ en-
forcement of the education provt. 
slons of Proposition 187. The action 
came only one day after voters over· 
whelmi~ approved the measure. 

Pollack's order came after ~ 
oents of Proposition 187, the con-
troversial initiative which will deny 
llletal immierants most state su~ 
ported selVices, flied a series of 
lawsuits to block its enforcement. 

The University of California re-
ceived an executive order from G0v-
ernor P-Ite Wilson asking the univer-
sity to develop regulations to imple-
ment Proposition 187 yesterday, 

accordi~ to a university press re-
lease, but will not implement them 
until the courts have lifted the re-
straining order. 

Under provisions of the the IlfOI» 
sitlon, the university would be re-
quired to report all suspected illegal 
immigrants to immigration offICials. 
The university reported that, in 1992, 
it was uncertain of the residency of . 
362 of its students. 

Accordi~ to the university state-
ment, UC President Jack Peltason is 
·pleased that the courts will provide 
an orderly process to reconcile pos-
sible legal conflicts among provi-
sions of Proposition 187, federal 
laws and the United States Constitu-
tion .• 

The california State University 
system and the convnunlty col.s 
are also covered by the court's ac-
tion. The hean,. date for the cha~ 
lenge to the proposition is set for 
Feb. 9, 1995. 

The American Civil Liberties Union 
(ACLU) field two lawsuits yesterday 
in courts in Los ~eleS and San 
Francisco. The successful San Fran-
cisco challenge was based on the 
1982 Supreme Court decision in 
Plyer v. Doe, which struck down a 
similar Texas law barmg Illegal im-
mierBnts from public schools. " 

The Los ~eles AClU suit, filed 
in U.S. Federal District Court, claims 
that immigration law is federal juris-
diction and can not be pre.empted by 
state law. 

. The California Medical Associa-
tion (CMA) also filed suit In Los

Proposition 187 violates the equal

I've Got Big 
Game Fever Tritons Welcome West Foes 

In this NFL IIeIIOn of 
parody, it is rare to find a game 
of any real lignifacance. I'm 
talking about I game between 
two great teamI with Supcr 
Bowl dreams dancing in tbeir 
beads. A game that any red-
blooded American football fan 
can sit down to, with a burger 
Ind a beer, whether his 
favorite team is playing or not. 
I'm talking about I battle 0' 
the century with pyrotechnics 
and ... well, you get the idea. 

Oh sure, there are those 
gut-wrenching battles for the 
basement between the Giants 
Ind the Cardinals, or Houston 
and CinciMati, which will 
grace TV screens across the 
country this weekend. And 
hey, who wouldn't want to 
watch that classic gridiron 
showdown between the Oilers 
and Bengata, who have 
amassed a combined total of 
two victories. 

CRUNCH nME: UCSD will host the NCAA 
Western Region playoffs this Friday and Satur-
day with a berth in the quarterfinals at stake 
By Den Kqft 
Co-Sports Editor 

No matter how well you run the 
race, if you don't finish strong, you 
were just lnother face in the crowd. 
Such is the case in Iny sport in 
which the champion is determined 
in a do~)f-die playoff system, and 
NCAA women's 
volleyball is no 
different. 

UCSD con-
cluded its season 
Friday night with 
a straight-set tri-
umph over visit-
ing Chapman Uni-
versity to raise its 
record to 25 victo-
ries and only six 
defeats. But the 
Tritons know that 
their phenomenal season is only one 
step toward a possible national title. 
The next step begins on Friday 
when UCSD will host the NCAA 
Division III Western Regionals. 
This is when the champions have to 
step forward, give that extra 10 per-
cent and rise above the rest. 

5). The winners of these contests 
will face off on Saturday night at 
7:30 p.m. with a berth in next 
weekend's quarterfinals on the line. 

The Tritoni closed out their SCI-
son with five consecutive victories 
and wins in 12 of their last 13 con-
tests, and are feeling good about 

their chances as 
the playoffs get 
underway. 

. "We're confi-
dent," said sopho-
more outside hit-
ter Madelyn 
Ripken. "We're 
confident in our-
selves and confi-
dent that we can 
reach our goal." 

That goal is a 
That's correct. These two 

teams have played 16 games, 
and on only two occasions 
have they managed to snatch 
victory from the jaws of 
defeat. For the most part, these 
squads have found themselves 
on the short end of scores like 
1,000,032 to two, with those 
two points coming as a result 
of a safety when the opposing 
punter accidentally tripped on 
a blade of grass and fell out of 
the back of the end zone. 

UCSD's opening game of the 
playoffs is a rematch against 
Chapman (23-8) at 7:30 p.m. on 
Friday evening. At 5 p.m., there will 
be a showdown between the other 
two teams in the Western Region: 
the Cal Lutheran Regals (19-8) and 
the ~idental College Tigers (19-

national title and 
it is well within the reach of the Tri-
tons, who are, in the words of Head 
Coach Doug Dannevik, "battle-
tested because of the tough compe-
tition in the West this year. This 
team has the .ability to win [the 
title]." Dannevik added that, "we 
have key players that just won't let 
us lose and I trust them a 101. " 

UCSD knows all their potential 
oppcnents this weekend very well. 
They played Occidental twice and 
Cal Lu once. UCSD's only loss to 
a Division III opponent this season 
was against Occidental on Sepl. 20. 
But the Tritons avenged that loss

No, whit I'm talking about 
is a game such as Dallas vs. 
San Francisco. This is what a 
classic football rivalry should 
be. It's got history: "The 
Catch" that sent the Niners to 
their first Super Bowl in 1982, 
and the last two NFC champi-
onship games in which Dallas 
triumphed en route to titles. 
It's got old friends: The 
Cowboys defense is anchored 
by former bitter Forty-Niner 
lineman Charles Haley, while 
San Francisco stole Dallas 
linebacker Ken Norton after 
last season to fill a hole in its 
defense. And, last but not least, 
it's got trash-talking match ups 
between fast guys with big 
mouths.

Tigers on Oct. IS. 

"We'll look at film of [Chapman] 
as usual and have a game plan 
ready," senior Julie Harvey said. 

"We're not looking past anybody." 
Although the Tritons want to 

avoid looking beyond this weekend, 
an occasional glance has become all

Tritons challenge 
Bethany in Quarters 
ContInued from PIle 9 
said. "So they will be a bit more 
mature than our boys. [Other 
coaches] have said that it really 
shows on the field. " 

Obviously. Bethany, ranked last 
out of the four-sceded teams in the 
Southern Regionals held last week-
end, managed to squeak out a first-
round victory over Greensboro (15-
3). The contest was eventually de-

cided on penalty kicks, and Bethany 
returned the next day to demoralize 
the South's top-seeded Virginia 
Wesleyan (17-2-1), 1-0, in a 
matchup where Bethany was actu-
ally outshot by an incredible 31-3. 

"That says two things to us," jun-
ior defender Nick Terlecky said. 
"On the positive side for us, they 
can't be too wonderful on the offen-
sive side of the ball, and defense is 
our strength. But that also says that 
either their goalie is amazing or they 
are a team that has a lot of heart. To 
be outshot 31-3 is a demoralizing 
experience and they still won. That 
says something about the character 

of their team." 
Running into a team of destiny 

at this point in the season could 
prove lethal to the Tritons' own 
heart-felt desires of bringing home 
their fourth national championship; 
yet, the squad appears unfazed. 

"I think we are too good a team 
to be beaten by a team like that," 
Terlccky said. "We are much better 
than last year's [championship 
squad]. We're very deep and any-
one can score the goal that could 
win it all. We have no weak links. 
Most other teams we have played, 
we've been able to find it and ex-
ploit it before the end of the game. " 

Last Sunday's 2-0 blanking of 
Gustavus Adolphus is a perfect ex-
ample. Although the Gusties held 
UCSO in check for the first half of 
play, the Triton's endurance proved 
too much for the Minnc:sola visiton, 
as forwards Nate Hetherington and 
K. Christopher Fujii burned the 
Gusties' exhausted backfield. 

"Unless they come out with just 
an awesome arsenal that nobody 
knows about, the way this team is 
playing now we can take anybody 
out there," Assistant Coach Ted 
Pryzlybek said. 

Unfortunately, Bethany College 
is not the Tritons' only opponent in 

this ~r-die playa« ClOdoatation. 
The WCIIt YU'ainia weather, overcast 
and around SO degrees, could put a 
damper on UCSO's repeat hopes. 

"There's no question (that) rain 
would play into their huda, silICIC 
they arc probably used to it," 
PryzIybek said. "Also, the field will 
be different. The grass will be 
thicker, and the ball won't fly over 
-the ground like it docs here at our 
place. That will throw all of our 
passes off a bit. If it rains, the ball 
will be even slower." 

But the biggest factor won't be 
the speed of the grass, potentially 
foreboding cloudy skies or frigid 
climate. After all, UCSD captured 
the '93 banner in the less than balmy 
world of Williams, MA. The Tri-
tons' number-one enemy will most 
likely be the town of Bethany itself. 

"It's a rural town, very isolated," 
Armstrong said. "The crowd is go-
ing to be all over us. It is kind of 
like walking into a lion's den. I 
imagine the whole bloody town will 
be out there. That's why it is very 
important for us to get the right 
mental attitude. This is a big hurdle 
and we will see what this team is 
made of. We have no reason to fear 
anybody, but we have to treat this 
as a challenge~" 

"It's West Virginia. What else is 
there to do beside come out and 
scream down our throats? I know 
there's going to be a big crowd, but 
I imagine it will be like the Final 
Four last year," TerJedy recalled. 

"We are just about where we 
were last year. We arc not-looking 
ahead, but we are not afraid to talk 
about the future. We arc playing so 
well right now, our confidence on 
the field has really grown. We know 
what we have to do."

The Tritons will venture to Chino 
for the much-anticipated race. Held 
at Prado Regional Park, the Divi-
sion III NCAA Regionals will 
closely simulate the course condi-
tions of the upcoming NCAA Na-
tionals. 

"It's faster than some of the 
courses we're used to," Van Arsdale 
said. "It's a lot of rolling hills and 
grass ... very similar to nationals."

UCSO's remarkable depth of 
NftftCrs has created a bit of a pr0b-
lem for Van Arsdale, since each 
team can only send seven runners 
from its men's and women's squads. 

"I am still not sure exactly who 
will be Tieing," Van Arsdale said. 
"There are quite a few question 
marks. We have had an outbreak of 
colds, and we have to run who's 
healtby." 

A sure bet, however, to lead the 
way for th\' Triton men in Saturday's 
festivities, which begin at 9:30 a.m., 
will be junior J.J. Castner. Coming 
off an impressive second-place 
overall showing at the California 
Collegiate Atbletic Association's 
ClIampionships a week aso, Castner 
has a solid shot at grabbing the over-
all title. 

"If everyone runs up to their abil-
ity, we should win hands down," 
Castner said. 

Other runners from the UCSD 
men's squad likely to get tbe nod to 
compete include Walter Dehority, 
Neal Harder, Robert Ho, Gavin 
Klinger and :John Walsh. 

Nate Johnson and Mike Bums 
are also being considered. 

The UCSD women will start at 
10;30 a.m., and freshman sensation 
Kyndra Smith will likely position 
herself at the front of the Triton con-
tingency. An extremely consistent 
performer all season long, Smith 
will set the pace for a very young 
and surprising women's squad in 
this weekend's race. 

Additional candidates to break 
into the Triton top seven are runners 
Courtney Grey, Karen Hinkle, Me-
lissa Roberts, Jesse Therriault, Jane 
Zimmerman and Liana Wright. 

"I feel that the key to distance 
running at this stage in the game is 
being loose and just letting your 
body run," Van Arsdale said. 

But even with all its talented 
althletcs primed and ready to race, 

... a.v .......

For the men, Occidental College 
and Claremont-Mudd College pose 
the largest problems. "Occidental is 
a good team," Van Arsdale said. 
"Claremont has dropped off a bit, 
but they have a super coach."

As for the upstart Triton women, 
Whittier College and Claremont-
Mudd-Scripps University are their 
biggest foes. "We're ready to race," 
Van Arsdale said. "We're relaxed 
and focused." 

Even if UCSD doesn't fare well 
as a team in Chino, the possibility 
still exists for a few standout Triton 
performers to advance 10 nationals. 

For a team which does not place 
in the top two, three individual men 
and four individual women can still 
move on to nationals if they place 
high enough.

Lisa Wang, BSEE University of California San Diego '92, often stops by QUALCOMM's Fitness Center after work 
for a game of tennis. :It.: "I get so mentally 
involved with the backplane I'm working on, I 
need physical exertion to bring me back to earth." 
:*: Engineers like Lisa understand that principle, so 
it's no wonder that QUALCOMM has a·Fitness 
Center-the company is, after all, run by engineers. 
(ii/:: "They also understand that some people do better 
early in. the day and others later," continues Lisa. "So they developed a Flex-Time 
policy that lets people set their own hours." . : What does she enjoy most about 
being a QUALCOMM engineer? "You can make cool stuff like on The Jetsons~" 
:'j:: This includes the application of QUALCOMM's Code Division Multiple Access

Systems (PCS), OmniTRACS® satellite-based mobile communication networks and

wbile the Cowboys are 8-1 and on 
a six.game tear. Theae two squads 
have been waitin, for this .tc:bup 
since the lC~ulea came out - es· 
pecially San Francilco, whicb 
would clcaperately like to avenge its 
losses to the Cowboys in the Jut two 
NFC title gamea. 

No one in the City by the Bay is 
denyin, that the 4gen have been 
greedily eyein, this opportunity for 
revenge for montha. San Fran'. Pro

Ripken has become 
UCSO's leadi~ killer with 
her aerial Ieft~

Her lefty swing aiso

her in a variety of 
offensive positions which

opposi~ teams nnIy see. -She·s a gamer. She 
has played solidly for us all year long. " 

AnCeIIe Crochet 
PaIItIon: Outside hitter 
--= Jll'lior 
A junior college transfer, 
Crochet has quickly 
learned the game plans 
and has become a key 
offensive threat. She is 
also one of the Tritons 
primary passers. "Her

was eYident when she was inj"ed. I think that she 
may be the best outside hitter in the nation. " 

"JeM is a potential game breaker. She is capable 
of domin~ as a blocker and attacker. " 

julie Harvey 
PaIItIon: Outside hitter 
--= Senior 
Harvey's versatility alloWs 
the coachi~ staff to play 
her allover the court, 
often matching her 
against opposing middle 
blockers 01 as an 
altemate setter. "Harv's 
daily effort in practice is 

KrIstI Alkeland 
PoIItIon: Middle blocker 
--= Senior 
Nicknamed "Alaska" by 
her teammates, Askeland 
is also a veteran of many 
an NCAA playoff contest. . 
Her solid blocking ability 
will be a key to the Tritons' 
success. "!Vistiis

are the best blocking tandem in the nation." 

"v. BALL: UCSD 
":, hos~; NC~ R¢gional 

t I'. ~ ,I . • ')., 
... ~_"".9 
• i.fie mot~ !eppH~§, because the 

number-one team II'! ~he nation -
and UCSD's traditional rival -
WUhiniJton Univenity (OH),lurks 
IS the Tritons' likely challenger in 
the quarterfinals. 

But the scheduling quirk, whieb 
will likely force an early showdown 
between the number·one ranked 
Bears and tbe aecond·nnked Tri-
tons, does not bother UCSO. 

"It was inevitable; senior 
blocker Jenn Cross said. "We were 
going to have to play them to win 
the championship anyway. " 

The key to UCSO's playoff 
hopes may lie in the middle where 
Cross and fellow senior Kristi 
Askeland will be playing without 
IOphomore middle blocker Chris· 
tine Chi, who went down with an 
ankle injury. Chi bad been an 
emergillJ force on offense and de· 
fense prior to her injury, <lOIIIiatently 
placing amollJ the team leaders in 
kills and blocks. 

"We're all going to llave to step 
up [without Cbi]," Harvey said. 

Luckily for UCSD, it is deep at 
~ middle blocking position with 
tbe experience of Cross and 
Askeiand. In addition, outside hit-
ter Kelly McGlothlin wiU be moved 
to the middle in cue any injuries 
should befall the leam. . " 

UCSO's offeRIC will likely be 
focused on the oullide. where the 
team's offensive leaders - Harvey, 
Ripken and junior AngeUe Crochet 
- form a IOlid core .riton 
spiken. Ripken is the team leader 
in kiDs (258) followed by Crochet 
(240) and Harvey (196)-

"1'boee three are j_ winners, .. 
Dannevik said. "They form the beat 
oore of middle bJoc:ken 011 any team 
I've seen.-

nm Cllln/CiuMIIIrI 

KrId Aekelend (rIfht) .... Jennifer IcIIoIeId .tuft up the middle. 

The team is quarterbacked by 
fifth-year senior seiter Jennifer 
Schofield, who baa been steadily 
improving throughout tbe sCuon 
and bas amused 979 lIIists. Her 
"even· keeled" penonality will have 
a calming effect on the team IS it 
Jets into the hot and heavy action 
of the playoffs. UCSO's secret 
weapon is ill strong bench. 

"Our second team could qualify 
for NCAA's, - Dannevik bouIecI. 

In addition to McGJotbIin, jun· 
ior Joyce Lee may piay a key role 
this weekend and beyond • a de-
fensive specialist who will rotate 
into the back row for the Tritons and 

Jet the tough dip. Sophomore out· 
side bitters Bonnie Kelly, a good 
server and passer, and Micke 
Bicsheuvel, a spectacular hitter and 
server, will also be ready to fill in. 

UCSO baa freshman power on 
the sidclinei u well in the form of 
Monique Thiry-Zaragoza, a defen-
sive specialist, and setter Christy 
Thoma, who bas gotten valuable 
experience tbis season and is 
Schofield's only blckup. 

-We're not spectacular,-
Dannevik said, -but we JCl the job 
done. We've improved steadily 
tbrouJbout the year and still have 
our belt matdle:s ahead of us."

FILM REVIEW ALBUM 
REVIEW 

Mary Shelly's 
Frankenstein 

Director Kenneth Braoogh 
shows sympathy for the rrwnster 
By Chl.un Simmons 
Guardian Reporter 

A sailing galley braves the gla-
ciers of Antarctica as its relentless 
captain (Aidan Quinn)drives his crew 
further north than anyone has ever 
traveled before. Although the initial 
scene in director Kenneth Branagh's 
Mary SheLLey's Frankenstein appears 
unconnected to Ihe story as we know 
it, it is actually the opening inShelley's 
Golhic novel, which was published in 
1816. 

In thefirsl Frankenstein film which 
attempts to slay true to Shelley's text, 
Branagh eochants and horrifies as he 
portrays the complex and unforgiving 
world of Dr. Frankenstein. 

This is no movie for the faint of 
heart, or fans of gore feasts such as 
Nip/o/Ilre Living~ador Fridilyllre 
13th. No, this isa horror film for those 
with sophisticated palates. Mary

diences with images of human sav-
agery. 

Branagh, the talented Idor/ din:lC-

tor of films such as Henry V, Dead 
Again and Much AdoAboul NOIhing, 
once again astonishes with a polished, 
fast-paced film. In addition to direct-
ing, Branagh stars as Victor Franken-
stein. 

Although his experiments are grue-
some, Branagh's tormented character 
evokes the audience's pity. Though 
the part of Dr. Frankenstein has been 
played by many famous actors (Sting 
played him in The Bride), Branagh's 
performance outshines any in recent 
history. 

Branagh presents us not merely 
with a mad scientist, but with a man 
driven to discover the limits of sci-
ence, and cross the boundaries of life 
and death. After he witnesses the un-
timely deaths of his mother and cher-
ished professor (John CIeese), Victor 
becomes obsessed with the desire to 
create human life. 

After piecing together the body 
parts from a variety of CIOIpICI, Victor 
creates the monster {Robert De NIro).

The Black 
Crowes 
Amonca 

A ........... A. 

Every song on the Black 
Crowes' new album, Amorica, 
IOIUIds like something that has 
been pICYiously recorded. How-
ever, the Cro~es play with such 
enthusiasm and skill, the fact that 
they sound derivative is quickly 
forgotten. WithAmorica, the band 
shows maturity in their tight play-
ing and excellent songwriting. 

One of the most obvious dif-
ferences which separates 
Amorica from its plCdecessors is 
the emphasis on percussion. 
Drummer Steve Gorman domi-
nates on the opening track, 
"Gone." His steady beats and 
Johnny Colt's smooth bus pro-
vide the backbone for the album 
and allow guitarist Rich 
Robinson ample room to show-
case his playing talents. 

Robinson's restrained solos 
on "A Conspiracy" and "Wiser 
Time" result in a c:1eaner sound 
on Amorica. Lead singer ClIris 
Robinson (Rich's brother) shows 
he still bas the lyrical talent he 
demonstrated on the band's pIC-
vious albums. Ballads such u 
"Nonfiction" and "Descending" 
lie beautifully sung.

The War 
Young cast carries film 

ByW.".. No 
Senior Staff Writer 

With Gumpmania on the loose, 
depictions of the South are becoming 
a trend in American cinema. The new-
est offering from the Southern band-
wagon is director/ co-producer Jon 
Avnet's The War. 

Avnct's debut film, Fried Green 
Tomatoes, a box~ffice hit, demon-
slratedhisabilitytoapturctheSouth-
em lifestyle. While both Fried Green 
TomaJoes and The War attempt to 
make moralistic statcmentsabout life, 
the similarities end therc- The War 
is an entirely different film. 

Set in 1970, the movie catalogues 
the summer of a young boy named 
Stu SimmoM (Elijah Wood), and the 
hardships he and his family undergo 
as his father (Kevin Costner) fails to 
find stable employment as a result of 
flashbacks of the Vietnam War. Stu 
and his sister Lidia (Lexi Randall) 
occupy their time by constructing a 
tree house using remnants from their 
demolished home, which now lie in a 
junkyard owned by the bullying 
Lipnickis. 

The father's hopeless search for a 
stable job, home and identity gives 
this movic a strong, realist tone. Ugly, 
malnourished kids with just as ugly 
verbal skills stand in stark contrast to 
the serene beauty of the South. 

Just when circumstances start im-
proving for the Simmons, a series of 
improbable events brings them down 
again. Costner docs little to give these 
situations credibility. 

Critics were skeptical of a cast 
comprised largely of child actors, but 
The Warbouts some of the best fights, 

PLAY: La Jolla 
Playhouse production 
puts business first 
ContInued from .... HI 

The set is a fabuloualy compli· 
cated series of oolored panels and 
swinging doorS which reaemblcs a 
high school built in the '60s. The 
lighting is done with stencils. The 
bank of video monitors add much to 
the budget, but almost notbina to the 
play's aesthetic quality. The only 
moment in which video is UIcd etrec-
lively is when we sec Roeemuy's 
house inthedislance,sIowlyapproech 
it from above and ao DaM doWIl ill 
cbimoey - a IIIqUCIICC deuly influ-
cnc:.aI by GulfWu 1DJ8It- bomb foot-
age. 

fuMiest shenanigans, most suspense-
ful moments and lIOII1e highly emo-
tional scenes, all perfonned with skill 
by the young cast Newcomer LaToya 
Chisholm, who plays Lidia's friend 
E1vadine, is an expert al dishing out 
enough hcad-swivelin' attitude to fill 
every inch south of the Mason-Dixon. 

The frustration ofbcing trapped in 
a disillusioned world - a common 
sentiment in post-Vietnam America 
- is expressed well by Wood's rag-
ingperformanc::e. Considcringhis age, 
Wood does a remarkable job portray-
ing Stu's deep-seeded aDger - his 
contlictofwantingtofigbt the ubiqui-
tous Lipnicltis, while baving to listen 
to his father's c1icb6d, make-love-
not-war advice. 

Despite malnutrition, lack of 
proper health care and miserable liv-
ing conditions, the kids manage to 
enjoy the simple things in their rural 
surroundings. The best examples of 
this amusing simplicity arc instances 
in which the kids enjoy their honest 
friendships. The imaginative 
Supremes' routines Lidia and her 
friends perfonn throughout the movie 
portray theclosefricndships that exist 
between the childrcn. 

All the pent-up frustration and an· 
ger, however, make for a worthwhile 
ending. It IeavCII you with a good, 
though embarrassingly mushy, feel-
ing inside. 

The War is about the inheritanceof 
discnchantmcntandhopclessness with 
which the Vietnam War left an Amcri-
can generation. However, perhaps the 
most important theme the movie ex· 
plores is the war between right and 
wrong. 

One would like to think that the 
Playhouse staff appreciates the irony 
in the scene in which Finch sells his 
doomed ad campaip with the pitch, 
"We'll be combiniaa sex and greed 
- we can't lose!" With "How To," 
the Playhouse has united a dull, sexist 
story with a commeraat Broadway 
mindset to gcnaate a lifelCII produc.1 
which receivCII standing ovations. 
Now that '5 good business. 

If the Playhouse can't sec the les-
sons in its own text, one must con-
clude that there is no irony at all 
behind this garish ode kl the contem· 
porary maadlplace. 

Although all performances of 
"How To" m IOId out, 1tancIina-
room«&lyand pubtic lUll! ticlr.ecs are 
available on a limited t.is. For !DOle

CONCERT REVIEW 

Hole 
Singer's antics mar concert 

By Jeff ...... 
HI.U8 Editor 

Hole singer-guitarist Courtney 
Love has expcrienccd her share of 
tngcdy this year. Her husband, Kurt 
Cobain, lead singer of Nirvana, killed 
bimself,andHolebusistKirstcnPfafl 
died of a drug overdose. Love's real 
life hardships only made her appro-
priately titled album, Live '1'1vough 
71tis, all the morc potent. Critics 
praised the intensity and emotion 
found in Love's songs, which often 
deal with feminist issues. 

Although Hole was originally 
scheduled to tour shortly after the 
release of Live Through This, the tour 
was postponed after Cobain's and 
Pfaff's deaths. It 's somewhat surpris-
ing to see Hole on the road, but the 
shows have drawn largeaowds. Tues-
day night's sold~ut performance at 
SOMA, however, was a letdown. 
Hole's flat performance was plagued 
by poor timing and Love's confusing 
between-song antics. 

Before playing the opening song 
"Plump," Love muttered, "fucking 
guys. "It was an appropriate introduc-
tion to a song about a bulimic woman. 
Love, who jobdaboutlaownweight 
at one point in the show by saying that 
she was prepant, c:aptwed the con-
tradictions of bulimia with lines like 
"l'hcy say I'm plump' but I throw up 

aU the time." AIthougb the opcnina 
track had plenty of energy, the . 
cooc:eIt's .,.ang was thrown off by 
Love's COIIItant bantering. She threw 
water on the crowd and bid-mouthed 
her guitarist, Eric Erlandson. saying 
she could find him a job with Nine 
Inch Nails or Ministry. 

At one point in the show, Love 
broke down and started aying. She 
told the audience she sliD loved and 
missed Cobain. She also screamed, 
"You hated him - said he wasn't 
punk and sold out." Her breakdown 
seemed staged, especially when she 
asked if everyone was content now 
that they had seen the "freak show" 
they wanted. 

The best of the 16 songs Hole 
played during its one-hour and 10-
minute set were the punk-oriented 
ones. Hole let loose on songs such as 
"Credit in the Straight Wprld" and 
"Rock Star," the closing number. 

At the bcginriingoftheshow,Love 
told the crowd she would not perform 
her traditional stagedive because fans 
at previous concerts bad been tearing 
offherclotbes. At thecndoITuesday'5 . 
concert, however, she dove off the 
stage, only to have a male fan try to 
stcaI her underwear. Once she was 
t.ck on the stage, Love tried to maul 
the fan with the microphone stancI. 
It's been that kind of year.
