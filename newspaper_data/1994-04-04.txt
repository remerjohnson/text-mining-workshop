DAVIS - The West Davis 
·Community Association has 
filed two lawsuits against the 
UC Board of Regents, 
charging it with non-disclo-
sure of health and safety 
threats posed by two separate 
developments on the UC 
Davis campus. One suit 
cballenges the legality of the 
approval of an environmental 
impact report (EIR) prepared 
by the university in 1989 for 
the expansion of a primate 
research center on campus. 
The other suit questions the 
validity of a university-filed 
note of exemption that frees 
UCD from congucting an EIR 
for the construction of a new 
neuroscience center.

THREE DAYS 

The A.S. Council voted to stall a decision 
on whether to withdraw from the University 
of California Student Association (UCSA) 
last Wednesday, pending its investigation into 
UCSA financial activities which may be in 
violation of the Smith v. Regel/IS decision. 

Some council members are concerned 
about possible violations of the Smith ruling 
that the UCSA may have committed through 
its association with the UC Lobby Corps, a 
splinter lobbying organization formed by the 
UCSA to separate its lobbying activities from 
mandatory fee-funded activities.

Costa Verde Sponsors A.S. Shuttle

1be months of soliciting spon-
sorship for the Associated Stu-
dents' shopping shuttle ended last 
week when the Costa Verde shop-
ping center, across La Jolla Vil-
lage Drive from UTC, agreed to 
support the newly-created A.S. ser-
vice. 

1be shopping-shuttle program 
provides UCSD students with 
weekly transportation to a local 
shopping center. The program be-
gan last fan after students voiced 
enthusiasm for the idea during the 
1993 A.S. election campaigns. 

A.S. Commissioner of Opera-
tions and Services Greg Bakken 
announced that Albertson's super-
market will fund $600 of the total 

$900 Spring Quarter cost for the 
shuttle service. Beginning next fall, 
the Costa Verde Center will cover 
the entire $2,700 annual cost.

customer base of students,

ditional discounts on groceries. 
Costa Verde hopes that these stu-
dents will continue to frequent their 
center even after they move off

campus. 
Bakken found that shopping 

shuttle riders spend an average of 
$22 per trip on groceries and used 
this data to convince Costa Verde 
to fund the project after Ralph's 
supermarket rejected the idea. 

Bakken said that Margaret 
Suchan, Costa Verde Director of 
Marketing, '1umped at the chance 
and was very excited about the 
program." Suchan is also consid-
ering advenising the service to 
new students in freshman orienta-
tion packets and at promotional 
booths during welcome week. 

Bakken says he hopes that "this 
is one step in a bigger process," 
adding, "If Costa Verde [sponsors 
a shopping shuttle], then maybe 
UTC will do it too."

wo years ago, Marshall 
senior Cheli Mohamed 
co-chaired the Lesbian, 
Gay and Bisexual Asso-
ciation (LGBA) and 
acted as a peer counse-
lor for Psychological 
Services' Lesbian, Gay 

and Bisexual counseling services. 
During Welcome Week she sat in 
an LGBA-sponsored booth, where 
she was approached by several 
people with concerns about friends 
who had come out of the closet 
with their homosexuali ty . 

"We had several students come 
up to us and ask, 'Well, my friend 
came out to me during the summer 
and I don't know what to do. How 
can I be supportive?'" Mohamed 
said. "We realized that maybe this 
was an issue that people WCRltl'Ug-
gling with." 

Out of this experience grew 
Common Ground, a discussion 
group for lesbians, gays, bisexuals 
and heterosexuals. Like the na-
tionwideorganization Parents and 
Friends of Lesbians and Gays 
(PFLAG), Common Ground was 
initially created to give support to 
friends and relatives of gays and 
lesbians dealing with issues of 
sexual orientation. 

Mohamed faced several chal-
lenges as she tried to establish the 
program, such as creating an envi-
ronment where students would feel 
comfortable discussing theirsexu-
ality, and making students aware 
of the new group. In the begin-
ning, the group foeused on coun-
seling the friends and loved ones 
of gays, but later broadened the 
focus to include discussion be-
tween heterosexuals and homo-
sexuals. 

Mohamed approached Psycho-
logical Services Director David 
Blasband with her idea for Com-
mon Ground as a new drop-in 
counseling group. The poup was 
approved and Mohamed began the 
process of informing students of 

itsexis~. 
"At that point I already told 

myself ' goin, to be h8rd to get 
started because thil illuch a sen-
sitive issue," she said. 

She spread the word by tellin, 
her friends and co-workers and 
posting flyer advertisements, but 
Common Ground suffered low at-
tendance for its first six months. 

"I was trying to approach the 
same people who came to us dur-
ing Welcome Week, but 1 think 
that a lot was still very threaten-
ing, the idea of ,oing to a place 
where they would discuss their 
friend's suuality," Mohamed 
said.

Psychological Services' peer counselors, provides a forum for lesbians, 

gays. bisexuals and heterosexuals to discuss their concerns and 
problems with each other 

IY Itlill CIIUII. ASISCIATE NEWI EIIT" 
Thefoeus of the group changed 

dramatically when Mohamed was 
approached by a group of students 
from the LGBA, who suggested 
opening the group up for dialogue 
between themselves and their het-
erosexual friends. 

"[They approached me] and 
said 'We have other friends who 
are straight and who hang out with 
us and they just want to open a 
dialogue between straight people 
and gay people and hopefully sort 
of realize that we have a lot more 
in common, .. ' Mohamed said. 

The group evolved from a sup-
port group for heterosexuals to a 
forum for students, gay and 
straight, with an inteRSt in talking 
to each other about relevant issues 
such as hate crimes, reli,ion and 
homophobia. The switch greatly 
affected anendancc. 

"Sure enough, once we changed 
the format from a support group to 
an open dialope between heter0-
sexuals, bisexuals, lesbians and 
• ays, it attracted a lot more 
people'" Mohamed said. 

Yiannis Psaroudif, one of the 
students who helped Mohamed 
develop the new focus of Com-
mon Ground, said he thought that 
more publicity was needed in the 
beginning tOlpread the word about 
the group. 

". knew Cheli through LGBA, 
but • had no idea about this pr0-
gram. When I did find out about it, 
I thouJht it was a really lood idea. 
but it seemed like they weren't 

publicizing it enough. ] mean, I 
knew Cheli, and] hadn't even 
found out about it when they started 
holding sessions," Psaroudif said. 

Publicity played a large role 
in helping Common Gr.ound de-
velop its new foeus. Psaroudif de-
signed an ad campaign which fea-
tured the now-famous slogan 
"YOU KNOW A GA Y ... so why 
not come to Common Ground, an 
open discussion between bisexu-
als, lesbians, gays and heterosexu-
als." 

The ads attracted 18 students 
the first week. They came from a 
variety of backJfOunds, some in-
tcrated in promoting discussions 

GUARDIAN 

FERTIES 
with their heterosexual and h0mo-
sexual friends. Others were just 
interested in meetin, people . 
Psaroudif said the flyen convey a 
very basic truth. 

"I just wanted people to realize 
that there was a common ground, 
and also make it clear that whether 
people realize it or 001, they do 
know a lay, a lesbian or a bi-
sexual," he said. 

As a discussion group under 
the administration of Psychologi-
cal Services, Common Ground 
offers confidentiality and profes-
sional resources to concerned stu-

dents. The facilitators also pr0-
vide information about other on-
campus and off-campus support 
groups. Another resource offered 
is the Psychological Services cli-
ent resource library, a source for 
books on topics related to the drop-
in group issues. 

"I think sometimes people feel 
more comfortable in peer counsel-
ing or drop-in groups because 
there's a sense of safety and com-
fort knowing that people might be 
more responsible towaid [issues 
of disclosure]," said Mohamed.

tiality and privacy may be im-

ence, the provilion of a "safe" 
environment il crucial to the 
Common Ground program. 

"I really believe in the Com-
mon Ground approach, because 
we need to battle homophobia any 
way we can," said Warren senior 
Nancy King, a Psychological Ser-
vices DRlg and Alcohol peercoun-
selor. 

"Lack of communication is 
often the billest problem, and 
people need a safe place for 
that to happen, which is what 
Common Ground provides," 
King added.

ity. 
"I think if s important for people 

to feel safe and be able to question 
sexual orientation without the la-
bels of being lesbian, gay or bi-
sexual," she said. 

TIle group format is fairly open, 
with discussion topics varying 
from week to week according to 
the interests of the participants. 
Past topics have included national 
issues such lIS gay adoption rights, 
loeal issues such lIS Grossmont 
school district's decision to refuse 
to adopt an anti-discrimination 
clause and personal issues such as 
hate crimes. 

Last quarter, Common Ground 
was temporarily discontinued by 
Psychological Services. Accord-
ing to Blasband, the decision to 
pull the plug WIIS largely because 
of a lack of paniclpation. 

"We weren' t Jetting the kinds 
of numbers that we were gerting 
before," Blasband said. "We were 
slower with publicity that quarter, 
and the service was also requiring 
a few of the peer counselors to do 
'double duty; helping out with 
Common Ground on top of their 
other responsibilities," he said. 

Mohamed added that around 
this time LGBA began offering a 
similar service, and it didn't seem 
reasonable for Psychological Ser-
vices to offer the same resources 
that students were getting else-
where. 

After a workshop about sexu-
ality issues was held at Marshall 
College IlISt quarter, Mohamed wall 
approached by RAs who wanted 
to know where they could advise 
their residents to go if they had 
questions about these issues. 

"The Resident Advisors asked 
us, 'Where can we send our kids if 
they're having concerns about the 
issue of sexual orientation?' And I 
said, 'Common Ground would be 
the perfect place, if we still had it," 
Mohamed said. 

Because of this rise in interest, 
the IfOUP will resume meedn, next 
week. Thil quaner, Common 
Ground wUl be run by Mohamed 
and King. Kin, said she Is inter-
ested in addin, her own input to 
the program. 

"I'm really interested in the 
pro,ram for several reasons. 
Part of it is because people who 
arc copin, with issues of sexu-
aUty often turn to drugs or al-
cohol and It is important for 
them to get the proper informa-
tion on drug and alcohol abuse," 
she said. 

In the past, facilitators have

Clark urged "investigation, not

about the possible consequences 
of withdrawing from the UCSA. 

''The future of our campus is 
directly linked to our association 
with the UCSA," Clark said, add-
ing that the UCSA is the UC cam-
puses' major source of power in 
negotiating system-wide issues. 

Falk agreed, additig that the 
UCSA also provides a resource 
for campus governments. 

In a straw poll vote, the council

Nightmares of A.S. 
Elections of the Past 
SCANDALS: Campaign 
follies have cost A.S. 
candidates their seats 
., ..... FNund 
SenIor St." *"fer 

II's hard to tell who should be 
more nervous about this week's 
Associated Student elections, the 
candidates or Kelly Rubb. As A.S. 
Eleclions Manager, Robb knows 
how to run an election right and 
she is determined to keep this 
year's battle scandal-free, Or at 
least a lot more Scandal-free than 
iI's been in years past. 

". feel confidenl Ihat we're 
equipped to handle anything that 
might come up," said Robb. "I 
was elections chair at a commu-
nity college for two years in a row, 
and anything that could have gone 
wrong in one year, did." 

So even if a candidate's frater-
nity hires a pair of strippers to 
wrestle in Peterson Hall, in oil one 
nighl before elections (as A.S. 
presidential candidale John 
Robison's did in 1989), or if the 
ballots of a presidential run-off 
election remain sealed for six 
weeks while one oflhe candidates 
entangles the system in a web of 
last-minule legal maneuvering 
(like Ruben DUlin did in 1992), 
Robb stands ready to deal with it.

And what would she do if a 
winner reveals that he isn't even a 

" student because be couldn't pay 
, his fees, like president-elect 

Randolph Siwabessy grudgingly 
admitted last year? Robb said she 
has cleanly eliminated the possi-
bility of that embarrassing sce-
nario through her stricter pre-bal-
loting enforcement of the election 
bylaws.

entered the lecture hall to loud 
music. 

"She look off her long pants 
and then she had someone take off 
her lace stockings with theirteeth," 
the onlooker said. 

"She had on a large bikini top. 
Eventually she look that off and 
she took off whatever was around_ 
her waist to reveal the G-string. 
And then she mingled with the 
audience. Basically. a 101 of ",ale 
faces encountered some cleavage. " 

According to another observer, 
the stripper "walked from aisle to 
aisle letting guys grab her and let-
ting them suck on her [bream]. 
The audience was totally into it, 
yelling and screamin ....

Of course,

much to ask of 

Elections Manager 
Associated Students 

The ' event 
elicited outrage 
from many as-
tounded campus 
groups and high-
level administra-
tors, who blasted 
the fraternity for 
holding the func-
tion on campus 
and questioned 
the extent of 

any school. Indeed, Robb said she 
is aware of at least one grievance 
filed so far. and is bracing for 
more, should lhey arise. as the 
voting draws 10 a close on 1burs-
day afternoon. It remains to be 
seen whether any of them will 
prove as scandalous and amusin. 
as these gerns from recent memory: 

·In 1989, il WII reported on the 
day before the polls cloled that a 
panicularpresidenlialcandidate"

strippers to oil wresde on a recent

A.S. vice presidenl of adminislra-

"Bringing this sort of thing on

tion," said then-Women's Re-
source Center spokeswoman Patty 
Orozco. ". equate il to bringing 
things like racism on campus. It's 
right oul of ignorance." 

Robison denied reaponsibility 
for the event. thoup he admitted

In spite of his plea that UCSD 
"judge a man by his character, not 
by his affiliation," voters denied 
him the A.S. presidency in a later 
run-off election. 

-When no single presidential 
candidate won more than SO per-
«:ent of the voles in the 1992 elec-
tion, a run-off race between the 
two most popular candidates was 
held. Everything seemed to be go-
ing smoothly, until it was an-
nounced on lhe day after the re-
vote that one ofthecandidales had 
filed complaints aboul the elec-
tion process which Ihrealened to 
keep the uncounted ballots sealed 
for two weeks more. 

Ruben Dunln, who came in a 
full 10 percentage points behind 
Mike Holmes in the first election. 
alleaed that Holmes violated the 
bylaws by falsifying records of 
the campaign materials he used 
and said he could produce a wil-
ness to back him up.lffoundguilty, 
the race-leading Holmes would be 
removed from the ballol, giving 
Dun1n a virtual lock on the presi-
dential win. 

Holmes immedialely denied 
that any improprieties had taken 
place during his campaign. say-
ing. "It's absolutely absurd and 
untrue.U'sunfortunate thatapresi-
dential' candidate is so unsure of 
himself that he has to resort to 
unfounded mudslinging." Holmes 
added that he was looking forward 
to the judicial Board process so 
that the "Irue story" could be told. 

But Dumn was ready to play 
hardball. too. He refused to in-
form Holmes of the exact nature 
of the charges he had filed and 
declined to even tell him when the 
alleged viola lions had occurred. 

Holmes was flabbergasted and 
demanded thai Dunln be more 
forthcoming, asserting that all de-
fendants have the righl to know 
what they are being accused of, 
who the wilnesses are, and what 
the evidence is 10 be used against

hour after the review board re-
cessed, Dillin had already hope-
lessly sabotaged his own efforts. It 
would take a few more days be-
fore his case could be taken up 
again by the board, and in that 
time Dur4n' s star wilDess backed 
out. 

Though Dunln tried valiantly 
10 piece his case back together 
after the bottom had been pulled 
out from under ii, he was left 
hanging by a few Ihreads, Ihe 
last of which were promptly 
snipped by the Judicial Board's 
decisive 4-0 rulina in favor of 
Holmes. A lona-delayed ballol 
count confirmed Dur'n' s 
sneaking suspicion. Holmes had 
won the run-off by a landslide. 

·Last year's elections proved 
no less amazing. The ballots were 
counted u usual, and A.S. Vice 
Presidenl Administralive 
Randolph Siwabessy was found 10 

wanled a heterosexual facilita-
lor in the past, but they have 
been unable to find one. She 
said she thinks that King's par-
ticipation as a facilitator will 
help fulfill the group's main 
focus. 

"I think [having a hetero-
sexual facilitator] is great. 
That's what Common Ground 

have captured a 59 percent major-
ity of the voles for president. Ev-
erything seemed all right, until 
Siwabessy dropped the bomb that 
he wasn't actually a registered 
UCSD student. 

"Obviously, there has been 
some deception," said Siwabessy, 
who also admitted that he hadn't 
paid his fees for Winter Quarter 
1993, and thai his GPA was "prob-
ably" below a 2.0, yet he remained 
81 his A.S. POSI and collected his 
$80 weekly stipend. 

The revelation sparked a 
flrestorm of complaints against the 
president-elect. The A.S Consti-
tution specifically states that A.S. 
office holders must be registered 
students in good academic stand-
ing, which Siwabessy clearly was 
nOI. 

"It's very deceiving thai 
people are elected to represenl 
us when Ihey're nOI even stu-
dents," said D. A. Bartolotta, 
one of Siwabessy's erstwhile 
opponents in the presidential 
race. Bartolotta requested an-
other eleclion, but was denied

said. 

"As a heterosexual, it is of-
ten difficult to figure out what

I really feel that I need to do 
something and this is an oppor-
tunity," King said. 

bungling, various official student 
judicial boards and election com-
mittees, in the face qf overwhelm-
ing evidence, eventually found it 
in themselves to jettison Siwabessy 
and proclaim newly-elected A.S. 
Vice President Administrative 
Carla Tesak heir to the presiden-

-rial throne. 
To make sure the same awk-

ward circumstances are never re-
peated, the A.S. has begun to ac-
tively research every candidate's 
student standing to make sure he 
or she is eligible to run and hold 
office. 

"We've learned from the pre-
vious years," said A.S. Advisor 
Randy Woodard. "I question 
everybody's status, until it is 
proven to me that they are eligible. 
I think that should lake care of 
mosl of the problems that have 
come up. Everybody is under scru-
tiny, and that's why it's worked 
this year." 

"II's been a long, hard week," 
said Robbon Friday, who has been

since the polls closed for last year's

ICID l_n'l H_ Rides 
CBbr to _:III. 

By Dan Kraft, As.ociate SportJ Editor 

F or the members of the Tri-ton women's basketball team, this season's incred-ible roller coaster ride has been filled with its ups and 
downs. 

The Tritons began their season at the 
OIuclt Resler Tournament in Rochester 
New York, where they snared a third-
place finish led by All-Tournament se-
lection junior Sara Mease. The momen-
tum generated at the tourney quickly 
propelled UCSD to a three-game win-
ning streak. 

After opening the season with a 3-2 
muk in its first five games, UCSD's 
record quickly dipped below the magic 
.SOOmartand remainedentrenchcd there 
through most of the yeu. 

However, the Tritons' Bpirit was never 
broken. San Diego capped off its re-
building season with a terrific run, cap-
turing five straight victories to end the 
year at 13-11. 

O¥er the counc of the seuon, UCSD 
alw.ys ICemed to fall just a bitlhort in 
thecloscOllCS. But Malone's determined 
squad never c:ahed in ita chill'. 

"We've beeD in aloC of dOlI games 
thi. yeu, and we were bopiftIlO win 
them all along," UCSD HeadCoecb Judy 

Malone said. "Sometimes you don't al-
ways get the same breaks." 

By Feb. 19, UCSD finally scrapped its 
way to. winning record (12-11) with an 
89-86 defeat of Pt. Loma Nazarene. 

While the Tritons were unable to 
qualify for the NCAA Division III post-
season playoffs, they certainly carved a 
name for themselves down the stretch. 

In the last five games of the season, 
the Trilons made a habit of doing unto 
others as had been done unto them. They 
tallied narrow victories over Pt. Loma 
and Occidental and clubbed the Banana 
Slugs of Santa Cruz by 43 points in the 
season finale. 

The last game of the season was also 
an opportunity for UCSD's senior 
standout, Lisa Beaver, to shine as she set 
the all-lime school muk for scoring with 
1,274 points over the course of her in-
credible four-yeu career. 

Next year, the Tritons will return all of 
the playen OI1lheir roster except one, and 
although Beaver is perhaps the greatest 
basketb.1I player in the history of 
women's hoopa here at UCSD, the Tri-
tons hope to use the valuable experience 
they gained over the course of this season 
to propel them and tow.rd a possible 
playoff berth next yeu.

Triton len's 
fillS 

New Idenlity 
By Brian K. Hutto, Sports Editor 

Stealing a sneak peak al the Triton men's basketball team on Nov. 18, 1993, and noting the incredible optimism that oozed through the pores of 
each and every player on the 

young squad was enough to quell the 
raging fires of hell. 

Head Coach Tom Marshall had reo 
vamped both the offensive and defensive 
set· ups and the Triton athletes were gung· 
ho on embracing the new, up·tempo, fast-
paced, run.and·gun style of play. 

Enter Pomona-Pitzer a day later. The 
Sage hens shackled UCSD's boundless 
optimism with an 89-68 blowoOut in the 
Tritons' season debut. 

"We were thrown for a loop," Marshall 
said. "All of us .were wondering where 
we were and what was next." 

Marshall and his assistants returned to 
the drawing board. "We began to filter 
back into some of the things that had 
brought us success in the past. \I was a 
'finding ourselves' period." 

Slowly 'but surely, UCSD began to 
discover a new identity, ripping off three 
straight wins before falling to Division II 
OIapman, 81-68. 

The Tritons received a nuclear boosl 
of confidence following an unprecedented 
upset of Division I Northern Arizona 
University, 92-82, on Dec. 18. 

"That [win] gave us a shot of adrena-
line," Marshall said. "We showed that we 
could pull together. Winning that game 
was a complete shock to me." 

It was also enough to motivate UCSO'u 
into two seven·game win·streak sets. 

"I couldn't believe where we were at," 
Marshall said. "We had only lost four 
games under a tough schedule and were 
playing some very focused basketball." 

The stage was set for the NCAA Divi-
sion III Men 's Basketball National OIam· 
pionships, where UCSD found itself host-
ing none other than Pomona·Pitzer. 

"I was very happy we had a chance to 
redeem that loss," Marshall said. "We 
were an entirely different team. We found 
out who we were and what we could 
accomplish." 

Although UCSD trailed much of lhe 
way, • late surge, capped off by a Brian 
Van Noy 100foot jumper just before the 
buzzer, catapulted the Tritons 10 Ihe 
NCAA's second round of action against 
Cal Lutheran. 

UCSD played one of its strongest 
games of the Yllr, but eventually fell to 
the stronger Kingsmen. 

"We had a very good yeu," Marsball 
said. '" definitely didn' t think we could 
go 21-5."

With the A.S. Elections beginning 
tomorrow, students are faced with the 
question of who will best represent 
them on campus. In a move to fulfill 
this need and alleviate questions about 
the candidates, the Interfraternity 
Council (IFe), 
Panhellenic 
Association and 
the Order 'of 
Omega sponsored 
a candidate forum 
in the Price Center. 

The forum 
allowed candidates 
to express their 
views to students dilectl y apiDlt a 
panel composed of representatives 
from from the IFC, Panhellenic, the 
Order of Omega, Student Aff'annative 
Action Comminee (SAAC). and the 
AIIociated Students. The goal of the 
forum wu to establish communication 
links between the different 
oraanizations on 
campus to draw the 
student body 
together. 

It also served u a 
means to publicize 
the elections in 
hopes of increasing 
voter turnout and give the candidates 
an opportunity to express their views 
in a largerpubiicspbere. The sening in

The Greek System's Winter Athletic 

Season closed last quarter with 
the ISS and IFC Soccer 
tournaments. This sport's 
popularity has been growing 
exponentially since its 
induction into the Greek 
Athletic season, and this year 
provided a number of 
competitive and close games. 

The Interfraternity Soccer 
Tournament proved to be a free for all 
when early favorite Pi IUppa Phi was 
eliminated in the semi-finals by Phi 
Delta neta. Sigma Alpha Epsilon 
proved that they were a force to be 
dealt willi when they defeated the

The imporlance of Iludent 
government outreach to their 
constituencies is an issue that can not 
be overlooked. With the general sense 

of apathy that 
seems to permiate 
the campus, the 
type of personal 
communication 
between the 
candidates and the 
students will serve 
as a probable 
solution to the low 

voter turnout in A.S. elections. 
The forum, the first of its kind hopes 

to be an annual event drawina students 
into becoming more involved in the 
election process and the selection of 
their student leaden.

Outstanding

Does being Greek leave you little 
time for anything else? 1993's recipient 
of the Panhellenic scholarship 
achievement award, Senior Debbie 
Sellon, doesn't think so. With a 3.954 
cumulative GP A, Sellon, a ChemIBio· 
chem major, dispels Ihe myth that 
students have no time for 
extracurricular activities. "Organizing 
my time, making lists, and selling 
priorities," Senon said, are the three 
secrets to hersuccess. She finds having 
too much to do can be an uset because 
she, " tends tocqanize her time bener."

Wilh the initial introduction of the 

Greek Card last year, IFC and 
Panhellenic were able to work out the 
details in order for the stickers and 
discount lists to reappear Fall quarter 
and be fully avaliable for next year. 

The Greek Columns were also 
introduced last year. Five issues were 
published last year and one last quarter. 
After working out financial and logistical 
problems, the Greek Columns will be 
published in the Guardian five times a 
quarter every other Monday. A number 
of writing and production opportunities 
exist for those interested. 

The build-out of the IFC and 
PanheUenic offices will include a large 
bulletin board outside next to the existing 
mailboxes where chapters may post notes 
and announcements for their members 
as well as other Greeks. In addition, a 
FAX machine has been added to the 
office through a sponsorshipwilh Marine 
Sunwear. When set up completely this 
number will be released to chapters. 
Chapters can receive faxes at the IFC/ 
PanheUenic office which will Ihen be 
placed in Ihe chapter mailboxes. 

IFCand Panhellenicalso hopeGreeks 
will become more active in the direction 
the Greek system is growing by giving 
their input to chapter presidents and 
delegates on any matters of concem or 
interests that would contribute to events 
scheduled for the upcoming year.

UCSD Topples Adolphus, FaDs to Trinity 
ARIZONA HEAT: Tritons win bamburner over GUsaws Adolphus, 5-4; run out of steam against Trinity, 7-2 
By OlIn Sweeney 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's tennis team 
(S-3) traveled to Arizona this week-
end to square off against two of the 

nation's 
toughest Di-
vision III 
teams. 

The Tri-
tons began the 
weekend by 
defeating 
Gustavus 
Adolphus on 
Friday, 5-4, 
but they were 
unable to pro-
vide an en-

core, falling to Trinity University 
(TX), 7-2, on Saturday. 

UCSD Head Coach Liz laPlante 
knew that her team was in for a 
rough match against Adolphus, 
which was ranked third last year. 

Tritons in singles was third-seed 
Hilary Somers, who devoured her 
opponent (6-0, 6-1). 

Michele Malephansakul per-
formed magnificently despite los-
ing (5-7, 6-1, 7-6, 10-8). She had 
four matcb points in the third set, 
but couldn 'tclose out Tracy Ericson. 

To round out singles play, num-
ber-four Heather Williams yielded 
to Kendell Larson (6-1, 6-4), num-
ber-five Michelle Wilbur fell to 
Linnea Carlson (7-5,·2-6, 6-2), and 
number-six Kimberly Takemoto 
was outlasted by Sarah Lobland (3-
6,6-2, 7-5). 

The difference for the Tritons 
was in doubles action, where the 
team made up the 4-2 deficit with 
some unexpected heroics. 

UCSD's top team of Williams 
and Miki Kurokawa was masterful, 
defeating Ericson-Judge (6-7, 6-2, 
7-5). Mter losing a close first set, 
the duo bore down and won the 
second and third sets. 

At the number-two spot, Mal-
ephansukal and Somers dispatched 
Han-Larson (3-6, 7-6, 7-5). 

The Tritons responded with their 
most impressive performance of the 
year, winning a marathon-length, 
seven-and-a-half hour affair in 80-
degree heat. The match itself was 
even closer than the score indicated, 
with the victor being determined by 
the final match. 

Everything was even going into 
the final doubles match, where OIan-
dler-Wilbur rose to the occasion, 
posting a 6-3, 1-6, 6-2 win over 
Carlson-Lobland. 

Hilary Somers played • key role In Trttons 1-4 win over Trinity. 

Adolphus came out running, 
stealing four of the six singles 
matches. UCSD's number-one 
Diane Chandler did her part, play-
ing sensationally en route to a 6-3, 
6-3 victory over Alice Han. 

The other shining star for the 

"[Chandler-Wilbur] played a 
good match," laPlante said. "Their 
opponents were strong." 

UCSD was unable to repeat its 
outstanding performance on Satur-
day against last year's national run-

ner-up, Trinity. 
"II was tough to get psyched up," 

LaPlanle said. "The girls were men-
tally and physically tired." 

Things were rough from the get-
go for UCSD. Trinity quickly gained 
the momentum, sweeping the Tri-
tons in doubles. 

Williams-Kurokawa fell to

with regal authority and is obviOUlly 
smarter than any 10 Biology profes-
sors has a bunch of fancy words to 
describe ads. Words like "neo-Marx-
ist," "ethos" and "modernity," which 
I'm sure that if ( bad any idea of what 
they meant, I'd agree. As it is, I just 
nod thoughtfully and wonder if any-
body was watching the last time ( 
picked my nose. So I and my friends 
have other advertising terminology: 
"change it" or "take a look at ber!" 

One of the issues I'm mOIl CXlD-
a:medabout isbeercommercials, which, 
as I'm sure you're awm, offer accurate 
portrayals of what happens when you 
drink beer. I've stopped purchasing 
Budweiser, fearing that I and my friends 
wiU grow sickly sideburns and SIart an-
noying everyone with our incessant 
babble about stupid sitOJm women or 
bands that thankfully died 20 years ago. 

On the other hand, I have pur-
chased enormous quantities of Coors 
Light.) don 'I drink it, I just have cases 
of it sitting in my living room, wbere 
I am still waiting for dozens of bikini-
clad women to show up. Perhaps I 
bought cases that were past the expira-
tion date. 

Of course, some commercials are 
worth watching. After considerable 
hype, CBS ran a popular commercial 
sequel this weekend, starring Duke 
coach Mike Krzyzewski.1 badn'tseen 
it before, and I wasn't all that im-
pressed. First of all, I didn't think the 
first installment was very good. so 
why do they have to make LeprecMII1I 
2? I mean, you can barely recognize 
Coach K under all that makeup.

Hollow words. Those a~ what most 

people expect to bear around election 
time, Ind UCSD beine I tiny micro-
cosm proves no diffe~nt. POSIers

cations class called Advertising 
and Society for almost a full week 
now, I consider myself somewhat 
of an expert on the subject. 

What was that haughty scoff 
from all of you Biology majors? 
Sure, while all of you are studying 
for classes like Sexual Experimen-
tation in Vermin in order to go on 
to high-paying jobs, BMWs, 
country clubs and respected 
positions in society with superfi-
cial.titles like "doctor," I will get 
to watch Beavis and Butt-head in 
ODC of my classes. Take that. 

Advertising is something that 
affects all of our lives, but never 
more so than during crucial big-
time sporting evtnts, such as 
MTV's Sand Sillm. This program 
was filmed right here on Mission 
Bay and was on opposite the Final 
Four on Saturday. Its crowning 
glory came during a semi-football 
game. In order to score an extra 
point, one of the competitors on 
each team had to propel himself 
through the uprights, while the 

. ball sat safely on the beach. They 
• sprinted down a runway and 

jumped on a compressed air-
operated takeoff board. 

UCSD ,Eams Split with UC Riv:erside 
HOME AND HOME: Tritons take Friday's game from Highlanders, 6-5, but drop Saturday's match-up, 7-3 

This contraption launched the 
human projectiles into the air, and 
most of them sailed safely over 
the crossbar and onto the big 
pillow on the other side. 

Now we finally have a use for 
real football kickers. Instead of 
scrawny little fellows kicking the 
ball through the uprights for an 
extra point, we'll use the scrawny 
little fellows as the ball. It would 
be a two-point conversion if the 
kicker could land on his feet. 

Anyway, to get back to 
whatever it was I was trying to 
say, advertising is a major 
influence in any sports fans ' life. 
After all, when else would you be 
able to go to the bathroom? "We 
provide a service to the fans 
through advertising. If there were 
no commercials, people would 
simply explode in fountains of 
beer and pizza," a CBS spokes-
man almost surely would have 
said, if I had actually talked to 
ODC. But beyond the public safety 
factor, commercials are important 
for lots of reaaons, none of which 
I am aware of at this moment.

Advertising and Society, and I'm not

Off to its best start ever, the UCSD baseball 
team (16-3) earned a respectable split of its 
home-and-home series with Division II UC Riv-

erside over the weekend. 
The first game, played 

Friday at Triton Field, 
turned out to be the Tri-
tons ' most dramatic vic-
tory of the season. On the 
hill for UCSD was ace 
i!LWI~~.'1 lefty Ryan Flanagan fac-

ing the Highlanders' ace 
David Rios (5-0). 

Riverside, ranked sixth 
in Division II, got to 
Flanagan euly on. Derek 
Edwuds led off with a 

single to left, and second baseman Zak Salmon 
rifled a liner over the left field wall giving UCR 
a 2-0 lead. 

The Tritons responded in kind in the bottom 
of the first. Bobby Arban reached on an error, 
and Armando Sanchez followed with a single to 
center. Chris Miyake then nailed a triple into 
center to bring home both Arban and Sanchez. 
Miyake later scored on a groundout by Ricky 
Ramirez to give UCSD a 3-2 advantage. 

F1anapn found hiUllelf in and out of trouble 
throughout the day. In the third, he was lagged 
for back-to-badt doubles by Andy Owen and 
Dan Redington, which tied the pme at 3-3. 

But the Tritons struck back again in their half

Saochez, who is hittilll a healthy .373, deJjy-

ered a lead-off double to left. Miyake pUDCbed 
a single ioto shallow right, putting runners at the 
corners. Catcher AI DelFavero drove in Sanchez 
with a sacrifice fly for the first out of the inning. 
Miyake (.400, 2-4, 2 RBI), five for six in stolen 
base attempts this season, swiped second base 
and wenlto third on a poor throw. He scored on 
another groundout by Ramirez, giving UCSD a 
5-3 lead. 

Flanagan wu liplding onto a scant 5-4 lead 
when he was victimized by a shoddy defense in 
the seventh inning. Errors by Ramirez and Eric 
Quandt led to an Owen sacrifice fly, tying the 
game at 5-5. 

Flanagan (2.14 ERA, 7 1/3 IP, SR, 4ER,

the eighth. With one out, back-to-back singles 
by Scott Emmons and Jim Doyle spelled the end 
of Aanagan's day.

Kurt Luhraen, to qucllthe rally. As he bas done

SLOGAN SLINGING CANDIDATES FIGHT 
IT OUT FOR THE TOP SPOTS IN THIS 
YEAR'S A.S. ELECTIONS 

obody votes on this campus. In 
a normal election, at most 10 
percent of the student body will 
show up. Non-voting students 
say they either don't know 
anything about the 

AIsociated Students, don't care, or don't know and 
couldn't cue less. 

Next yeu could be pivotal for the A.S. H an 
autonomy agreementlurvives the numerous levels of 
approval ~ IUd it Iw already received the UCSD 
administration's OK - the A.S. will have a lot more 
power than it hu had before. It will be able to bire 
and rniew its own staff at wages that it sets. It will be 
able to build new services that an: not prohibitively 
expensive. And most importandy, the A.S. win have a 
belter, more powerful image. 

Image is everything where the A.S. is concerned. 
Many non-voting students don't take the time to 
punch the ballot because they see a weak council, 
which is incapable of doing anything worthwhile . 
Perhaps autonomy will increase interest in the group, . 
which controls a lipificant chunk of student activity 
fees. 

Not everything is great for the A.S. this year, 
though. As always, many of the candidates are fairly 
competent, but an equal number either have no clue 
about the issues on campus or could easily belong to a 
"future bureaucrats of America" club. 

The AS. already controls a great deal of student money 
and many of the activities on campus and Will soon gain 
much more control. This year, voting is not optional.

munity and other groups like Cbica~tinos 
For Creative Medicine .. . 
W ................ ,.. •••• III.n 

Yeah, that was one of the groups that I partici-
pated ia founding - those two organizations and 
also a number of other ones. For a period of time I 
engaged in student government. but there are also 
alot of other things that arc out there and that's 
where I kind of made the transition, [I liked) bow 
do you really make the most significaat impact on 
tbis campus? I personally think tbat the most im-
pact that a student leader can have is on,a one-oo-
one basis. And that's wbere I found myself pursu-
ing things like becoming a resident advisor, be-
coming I peer counselor and Dean's Intern for 
Warren College. I'm even a campus tour guide-
just so I could reach out and see wbat students are 
feeling and what 's out there. I have a real broad 
base of experiem:e on this campus and I think that 
these things all contribute to the position of A.S. 
president. 

To function as a president you can ' tlimit your 
environment Ind the things that you're doing. For 
example, there are certain isaues tbat I felt really 
need to be Iddressed on this campus and that's why 
I decided to participate last year as the chair of the 
Student Affirmative Action Committee (SAAC). 
which is a coalition of different organziations that 
are focused on the recuitment. retention and post-
baccalaureate opportunities of underrepresented 
populations, including women and disabled stu-
dents. I think that this broad base of experience 
really contributes to the ability to advocate. to. 
come up and approach the administration on dif-
ferentlevels and address the issues that need to be 
heard. For this, I think I've been recognized. For 
example, earl ier this year I was fortunate enough to 
be selected by the Council of A.S. Presidents in the 
UC system and the University of Californil Stu-
dents Association (UCSA) as one of the three 
finalists for the student regent position. 

I think all of my experiences have given me 
kind of a holistic picture of the university, ahout 
how to advocate and approach different levels of 
the administration, to be Ible to create movements

One of the thiap that I've seen. baving the 
benefit of iateracting witb five AS. Councillor 
personnel from eacb of tboIIe councils. is that a 
number of issues are buicall y perennial. They 
come up every year. they're talked about and some 
things are done aod IIOIIIe aren 't, but they jUit never 
seem togo aWly. 1belesame iasuescome up every 
year. includiJlS autonomy, includiag co-op agree-
ments. includina dropping the "VI.- everything 
from parking. traasponation 10 student fees, bike 
patbs. These things will always come up and Ire 
part of the job of servinl on AS. Council. And 
these things arc significant and they need to be 
addresaed. 

But there are other iSlUes that blVe yet to be 
addresaed, that bave not beea focused on on any 
level, es~lIy from tbe AS. preaident. The last 
two presidenc:ies, in fact. even though they bave 
promised and given lip service, bave not paid 
attention to tbesc other iSlUes. And I bow they're 
not politically popullr isaues. but tbey arc impor-
tant - that' I lootinl It the grou underrepresentalion 
of certain populations on this campus. 

If you look at the numbers, tbey speak for 
themselves. 1bey show thai VCSD is fliling in ill 
missioa to represent and serve the communitestblt 
arc tbe fulUJe of lbe state of California. If nothing 
is done on I proactive basis, if there isn't slpifi-
canl allention paid to tbese issues oa I proactive 
basis, then we are really failing tbe population of

The only doc:ument that is stronger than our 
documeat is UCLA·I. What people c:rilic:ize about 
our documeat i. that it .YI that the chancellor bas 
to approve our financ:ial policy. UCLA bll around 
$70 million - they can pay their staff, we cannot. 
We c:annot be completely financ:ially independent. 
we do not have that lUXUry. What our documeat 
doesn' t hive, aad it'l the only one Iystemwide 
doc:ument that docu't bave it, iI the dlanccllory 
veto. Once the chancellor approves a policy. unless 
we break the law, our actions cannot be rec:iaded. 
Therefore, we can do anything we want witb our 
money II long IS they Ipproved it before. 

The scc:ond tbing iI that it allows Ulto bave a 
different cl .. ification for personel. The univer-
sity has a very structured pay system. So If we 
wlnted to have sometbing like the food delivery 
service, wbich is something we want to establisb 
Fall Quarter 199~, we would have pay the drivers 
S8.981per hour. Witb autonomy. we can pay them 
minimum Wile and tbey caa keep tbeir tiJII. It 
allows us to establisb our own clasaifications sys-
tem for personel. wbich would belp us a lot witb all 
of the enterprises on campus. Also. if we purcbase 
things we arc freed from sorne university regula-
tion. For example, we wanted to build raiD shelters 
for the shuttle stops and university policy say. that 
we bave to buy redwood aad the bendles coSI 
aomething like SI,500 a piece. We would be ex-
empt from all oftbat. Right now we have no control 
over our staff, they're supposed to be working for 
us, but we bave no say in their evaluations. Witb 
autonomy, we would formally evaluate all staff 
and it would go on their recorda and filel. 

The autonomy proposal also stipulates that any 

apec:ial electiOlll have 10 he approvocl by the AS. 
by two-tbirda of the couac:il. Tbia would acrvl IS

We came up w1tb a proposal wbich cut the costs 
of bousin& by up 10 balf. it was between $140 and 
$150 per month for I room. The reason that didn ' t 
work is tbat our campus bas ceDtral dcbt-acrvice 
[on the buildings.) So Revelles payl as much debt-
acrvice 51 Warren. Nelt year, one oftbe thingl that 
we are loing to coacentrate on which we dida't thia 
year. is basically to organize a campaip 10 change 
debt service to the individual buildings. For el-
ample, Revelle buildinp are already psid off and 
the Revelle students pay equal debt service com-
pared to tbe Warren Itudenta aod the WarreD stu-
deats have cable and all of these luxuries thit the 
Revelle studenll don·t. The idea that we arc work-

now it costs the same everywbere and I dOD 't think

of the San Diego sc:boola Ire African American. 
while they repreacnt only 2.4 perc:ent of the cam-
pus. 1bere's somethina acriously wron, and when 
our studcntaovemmeat uyl these issuea arc fine 
and maybe we'll work oa them as a secondary 
thing. it is ridiculous. 

This needs to be a prime focus. There are a lot 
of things that we can do that past AS. Councils 
have done to initiate programs to support organiza-
tions which arc working on these issues. I think, for 
exa}Dple, that this issue with the c:ross-cultural 
center is really fundamental because our AS. Coun-
cil was basically ambivaleat to it and attacked it. 
feeling tbat tbey knew how a center should be 
structured. Or people thought sometbing is wrona 
with tbe proposal. But they don't have two legs to 
stand on because they have not lifted a finger to 
work on anything on this. There's only one area. 
one part oltbe A.S., that has actually lifted a finger 
todo anything and that's A.S. External, which hiS 
worked to develop financial aid peer counselors. 
That is excellent. That ' s tbe work of a couple of 
candidatea that are running rigbt now on tbe Stu-
dent First! slate. The people tbat are running against 
them have paid lip service to these issues, but have 
never done anything about them.

Well, the simple answer is, read the proposal. 
The propoul outlines and presents I brosd-based 
picture of a center that is focused on two main 
things: one, overall focusina tbe univenity's ef-
forts at crosa-cultural awareness. communication 
and education. And tbe other thing is to focus on 
these iasues of underrepresentation of student. stafr 
and raculty of color ethnic diversity. Like I said, 
there were 30 organizations involved in t1!is pro-
cess, but all these groups were those that had 
significant experience in looking at the ilSues of 
cross-c:ultural awarenellS and underrepresentation. 

To respond to the charge of exclusion. all tbe 
things that we arc focused on in the proposal are 
alreldy being done It one level or another. How-
ever, tbey're not being done in a centralized way so 
that we are really bridling tbe gap. creating an 
environment wbere populations that have beea 
billorically excluded from the university feel like , 
tbey're a pan of it. And. tbat' s become very diffi-
cult for students. For example. myaclf beina a 
Chicano student. when I talk to Itudenll in the 
commuaity or to students in bigh scboola, I try to 
relate to tbem that it's great to go to the university. 
However, wben they ask me how I feel or whether 
it's comfortable to be tbere or if then a lot of 
Chicanos tbere,l have a hard time answering that. 
because right now the university is not particularly 
focused on creating an environmen! thlt's condu-
cive to all of us. So we have to come up witb a 
creative solution for this problem. 

The crou-cultural center is IOIDetbina that is 
addrel5ing a lot of different things, includin, out-
reacb, developing a relationship with the commu-
nity - we bave no relationship with anyone south 
of 8 freeway. That's a liven. I've bad admiaiatra-

it but our service arca is San Diego and Imperial

lions based on thelDlClvea. Are they represeatative 
of the campus? No. Even look at the makeup of the 
current AS. Council - is it represeatative of the 
campus body? No. It doesn't represent what IIIOIt 
Itudenta are aud we have 10 make the effort to go 
. readl out to different groups wbicb are workin, on 
these isauel - student or,anizations. A.S. is basi-
cally up on an ivory tower. 
How ...... ,.. I •• ft tIIaI' 
. Tbere baa to be I lot more information about 

what the A.S. is doing. It has to reach out to 
campus, coordinate witb campus media - all 
campus media. Not everybody's gonna bave tbe 
time to go up to tbe tbird noor of A.S. and find out 
what's on tbeir agenda aad write things up to put 
tbings on their agenda. The A.S. needs to create 
kind of a more open environment. One of the ideas 
I bad a couple years ago that I would really like to 
see happen was opening up tbe meetings and let-
ting anyone speak. But the flct that it happens 
Wednesday nights upstairs in the Price Center does 
not necesaarily mean tbat everybody's gonna be 
able to come to it. 
. What I would like to see is maybe have at least 

one A.S. meeting per quarter at each of the col-
leges. So you 'd hive five in tbe Price Center and 
five at each of the colleges per quarter. Do some-
tbing like tbat. provided that they are accessible to 
different student populations. I mean, A.S. people 
have to go to these meetings anyway, they ' ll go 
wherever they are - wherever the meetings are -
and there's no reason to bave it up tbere except for 
convenience sake for people who bave their offices 
up there. We need to go to the colleges, publicize 
the fact thlt we're actually working on different 
issues and try and mobilize, try and create some stir 
about tbings that are going on. 

Look at some of the issues this year. including 
autonomy and housing. When hu the A.S. gone 
out and said. "Hey, we need students to go out there 
and show support and write letters. and create 
some Iction to show the campus administration 
that tbere is an interest in these issues." That hasn't 
been done and that's been the nature of my experi-
ence working witb SAAC and working witb stu-
dent organizations, working with the cross-cul-
tural coalition. Creating a coalition of multiple 
organizations not just students, but students, staff 
and raculty. We had no relationship witb the fac-
ulty on this campus in terms of student govern-
ment. And so we bave to create tbose linkages and 
reach out and let people know what's going on. Not 
just hope that people will read the GllllrdiIJn, but 
work with tbe GIIQrdiIJlI and other campus media 
II well.

The way I see tbe UCSA, having participated 
syatemwide as a representative on one of its coun-
cils. il a renectioa of the campuses. We have 
represeatatives on the bosrd of directors that direct 
tbe lobbying agendland everything for UCSA and 
that's a function of us. If people are criticizing the 
UCSA, they should be criticizing themselves for 
underrepresentation on tbe council. Pulling out of 
UCSA because we don't like wbat UCSA is doing 
or because of SIfIith v. Regntts is preemptive and 
irresponsible. 

VCSA has accomplished a lot. For example, 
my accond year on council they were working 
almost tbe entire year on getting some initiatives 
tbrougb the legislature on student fee-funded fa-
cilities.to keep a RIMAe from happening on other 
campuses. Not lelting other lIudent populations 
get exploited the way we did. I think UCSA has 
acted really responsibly to retool or refocus its 
effom to be lobbying the regenta. to be working 
within the scope of the university to prevent any of 
tbese kind of ideu about political Involvement, so 
to speak, that was brought up witb tbe Smith v . 
Regents dec:ision. Witb this retooling. you 've to-
tally shifted the focus of UCSA.

I think fundamentally this year our A.S. some-
what dropped tbe bell on it. 1bey dida't bring in 
enouah of the Iludent voice or try to mobilize 
Itudenta behind getting an agreement that would 
be really' significant and would empower and 
provide aipificant controls over our fees to the

TESAK: A.S. has 
accomplished a lot 
Continued from .... 02 
ued. The student autonomy proposal, we worked 
on tbltthe entire year, and before I was president 
I was working with Mike Ind started collecting 
data and material and tbis and that. With tbe co-ops 
it'lthe same thilll. With Mike I was on the co-op 
negotiating committee, then with the co-op nego-
tiating the MOU. It ' s a learning process. There are 
a lot of tbings. like the co-op, autonomy and hous-
ing that need to be continued. But one of the main 
problems with the A.S. is that you gel new people 
in there and tbey don ' t r""lize particular things 
don't work [which have already been tried .) So I 
think that is one of the main reasons why I want to 
stay . 

What we established Inis ycarto try to help this 
problem isan AS. library , which will include all of 
tbe different issues that we worked on. document-
ing everything that we 've done. If a given avenue 
didn ' t work. here's the explaination. That way, 
when we leave, we can take twenty steps forward 
and not take ten steps back . 

I want to continue to work on parking. We 
addressed Warren's issues quite affectively be-
cause there's going to be a new lot built and we 
have that shull Ie there. We addressed Warren be· 
cause we thought that it was the most safety-
oriented, we felt it was a safty risk. But there 's alot 
to do. Maybe what we might push fot next year is 
gelling centrally-located parking structures be-
cause there bas been land designated to parking 
structures and they keep forgeting about it and 
building on top of it. 

We also want to continue to work with the 
police department for a police review board. As it 
turns out [our proposal) violated several penal 
codes because we didn't have the right to ask for 
certain information. I spoke to the chief of police 
about establishing complete procedures, where 
one could file complaints in different areas, includ-
ing the Judicial Affairs Office and the Student 
Advocate Office. A lot of complaints don ' t get 
filed within the police department, especially 
against police officers. We would be establishing 
new complaint procedures. 

RIMMAC is openning and I'd like to work with 
programing to pUblicize these facilities. We want 
to unite students, we think that there isn't a lot of 
school spirit and large events that involve the 
entire campus.

I don't know how much you can do, to be 
honest. Other than following Robert's Rules of 
Order, you can't really do much because it has a lot 
to do witb the people who sit on council. What 
makes the meetings long is that everybody want to 
say tbeir piece even though it may have been said 
five times before by different People. You can say 
"time' s up" on the agenda item asa whole. and may 
times wbat John Barnes will do is say " I recom-
mend strongly not to expend time .... " but other 
than having a chair that has a really heavy hand, 
nothing can be done. But tbat causes more prob-
lems. I think its beller that people be really slow 
and repetative. which is not enjoy bale for me or 
anyone else, than for the chair to have a heavy hand 
because you then get into a lot of council problems 
about "wbo does he favor?" and "who does he give 
more time to?" That would cause more friction and 
cause a lot of people to work less effectively 
outside of councial meetings.

I tbink people are intimidated by Robert's 
Rules of Order, when people start raising their 
haadl and say, "I motion for this and I straw pole 
for thll. " Their eyes kind of go wide. But maybe if 
at tbe beginning of public input, John [Barnes) 
elplained I little bit more about "Ibis is what we 
do. would you like to speak." 

But I'm at my office all of the time aad a lot of 
random lIudents have come in, actually almost 
everyday. and I don't think I' m really intimidating 
person. I may be dlsor,anized sometimes and have 
everytbina all over my desk. bull don 'tthink I'm 
iJltimadating at all. 

Maybe we could do more things like BBOs. we 
bad three or four BBOa aad we filled almost all of 
the committeel from them. If I'm elected I would 
like to do more of tbem. and .aybe have an A.S.-

I would really rather nO! comment on the pro-
posal. I would rather tell you what we would like to 
do with regards to cross-cultural issues on tbis 
campus. Or do you want me to talk about tbe 
proposal. 
"·s ., to ,.. __ .her ,_ .aat t. t.Ik 
....... 

I think that there ' s a great need for enhancing 
multiculturalism on this campus. You have very, 
very low retention and you have very low numbers 
and something needs to be done, definitely. The 
way the cross-culural proposal is written right 
now, I personally do not agree with it because I 
don' t think it addresses Ibe issues effectively. I 
think it further isolates things. But I really would 
really rather not on about that, I would just like to 
say that the A.S. wasn ' t approached to help write 
this proposal. But we were interested. And the 
Slme day thalthe A.S. rejected the proposal, there 
was a resolution that stated that the AS. supports 
multiculturalism - we are willing to work on this 
subject, we think we need a cross-cultural center. 
So it 's not like we don't agree with the idea, we 
didn't agree with some specific ideas in the pro-
posal. 

I would like to see a proposal , and I would work 
for a proposal, that would be more inclusionary, 
that would create a greater awareness between the 
groups. I think that the greater population needs to 
be aware of the difficulties which these groups face 
everyday and have to overcome. Many people 
don't. If you create a cross-cultural center which 
cators only to underrepresented groups and has a 
govering board made up soley of these groups, it's 
really not going to get other people there. And I 
don't think the problem is having underrepresented 
groups understand were they stand and be united 
because I think they are, I think it's having the 
greater population recognize they have special 
needs and issues. If you create a center that does 
not create any incentive for other people to go 
there. lIoU are not going to increase awareness, 
you're nol ,oin,lo increase communication and 
respect, you're going to furtber isolate them and 
that's what I don't agree with. 

Butl would work extremely hard to address the 
issue. And I think it could be addressed with a 
cross·cultural center. more of a multicultural cen-
ter. where everybody would go. I think things get 
done better on a more personal level. If you go to 
a speech and hear about some nations in Latin 
America or some Mexican traditions or African 
traditions, you listen, but don ' t really get involved. 
I think that where barriers and prejudice come 
down is when you actually have a friend who is 
Mexican American or African American. I think 
groups need to interact, with activities, with pro-
grams, not by just going to lectures. I think a cross-
cultural center. in my mind, would be a place 
where all of these people could come together and 
plan events and actually gel to know them as 
people. That's what brings barriers down. And I 
would work very hard for tbat. 

I strongly believe in that , there's less than two 
percent international students on campus and it's 
not the euct same thing, but I'm an international 
student and I have two friends who speak Spanish. 
that's all .

Throughout the whole document the only people 
that are mentioned are students of color. Second. 
the governinl board who would run the cross-
cultural center would be made up solely of certain 
ethnic groups. If tbere ' s someone who isn ' t of that 
ethnicity or isn 'tan underrepresented student who 
wlnts to be involved. the proposal excludes them 
from being there. Obviously, underrespresented 
students bave a much greater need to be repre-
sented than other cultures, but if you complete 
exclude them there's really no incentive for any-
one elac to be there. 

Also, within underrepresented groups it did not 
mention, for example, Jews, Indians, IS in from 
India, Alians they don't really consider, Koreanl 
they don ' t really consider to ~ underrepresented. 
latin Americans, they're nO! Mexican American. 
I'm not included i. that group. They don ' t even

OUR PICK: 
PONCHO GU~VARA 

PresUknt 

P ••• II .... .,., a Warren College 
IlUdenI, bas been involved with campus lead-
ership positions sinc:e his lim week on cam-
pus, serving ~n !he A.S. and on his college 
counciJ. In addition, Guevara has worked 
doIely with several of the underrepresented 
JIOUPI OIl campus, culminating with a stint as 
chair of the Student Affirmative Action Com-
mittee (SAAC) 1aat year. 

Guevara wants to increase the number 
of UDdenepieaented students at UCSD, a goal 
be said be woaId work toward as president. 

Accordin& to Guevara, ways to incJease 
minority enrollment and retention include bet-
ter 0Ubach and recruitment and the founding 
of the Crosa-Cultural Center, which he has 
pasbed for from his position at SAAC. 

The Crou-CuIturai Center has created a 
peat deal of conboVersy within the AS. and 
lOme student orpni2ations recently, with some 
contending that the center would exclude the 
majority o{UCSD students. However, Guevara 
said many of these people were swayed for the 
center when he and other Cross-CuIturai Cen-
.. eo.Iitioo repleaentatives explained its pur-
pc. in pater detail. 

To prove the need for incraIed minor-
ity recrui1mcnt, Guevara pointed 10 UCSD's 
enrollment figures: African Americans make 
up 2.4 percent of the student body and 
Chk:uoa make up only 10 percent. Both of 
tbeIe are far below the percentages of these 
populations in San Diego. 

BeyoDd that goal. Guevara said he plans 
10 wort OIl what he called the perennial issues 
oftheAssoc:iated Students Council: autonomy, 
alteroaQve housin& parking and fees. 

He promises to increase student inter-
est in the AS., a common theme with candi-
... for every AS. position eadl year. But 
Guevara bas a c:onc:rete idea. He will hold at 
IaIt ooeAS. meeting per quarter in each col-
., instead of always in the Price Center, 
wbeJe meetings are currendy held. 

According to Guevara, the current coun-
cil_ a "seJVice mentality" toward its job, ~ 
vidins services such as a shopping sbuttIe in-
stead of dealing with bigger issues. In addi-
tion, be cJisaarees with the currcntAS. on sev-
eral key issues, including many member's 
rbetoric about the student autonomy proposal 
aad dismissal of the UCSA 

Guevara said the A.S. has not dealt well 
with the University of California Student As-
IOCiation, showing a willingness to pull out of 
the JI'OUP too quiCkly. He also called the new 
.. touomy proposal a codification of the status 

quo, since it allows a chancellor's veto. 
Guevara has the trust of student leaders, 

as evidenced by his selection as one of three 
candidates for student regenl He promised to 
be a grass-roots president, more in touch with 
his consti~nts than the current A.S. 

e.rl. r ••• k, a Warren College 
junior, is the incumbent. She was forced into 
the presidential slot last year after being elected 
to the vice president administrative position 
when the president-elect was found ineligible 
for ofl"lCC. Remarkably, she managed to accom-
plish some of her goals despite ber unusual 
ascent to power. 

Tesak said she worked on isSues that af-
fect all students over the last year, including 
pusbing for affordable housing on campus, in-
creasing student privaCy by discontinuing the 
university's use of social security numbers and 
increasing AS. autonomy. 

While gre~ter A.S. autonomy might 
not seem to benefit the student population 
at large, Tesak said very tangible bonuses 
will be eminent once tbe autonomy agree-
ment is in place. For example, benches and 
rain shelters could be placed at shuttle stops 
without adhering to campus codes tbat 
would make them probibitively expensive. 
Also, the A.S. could establish a late-nigbt 
parking shuttle, which is now too expensive 
because drivers must be paid a certain wage 
under university codes. 

On the Cross-Cultural Center issue, 
Tesak said the AS. should help increase di-
versity on campus, but the plan originally sub-
mitted for the center will not meet that goal. 
Instead of making underrepresented students 
feel more welcome on campus, the center 
could further isolate them unless changes are 
made to the proposal. accoqling to Tesak. 

On the issue of the UCSA, Tesak seemed 
to have less belief that the organization will be 
able to conform to Smith compared to Guevara, 
who thinks the UCSA deserves full support. 

Both candidates are extremely well 
qualified and have a good grasp of the issues, 
but Guevara has the advan"e of being new 
to the job. While students often stay in the AS. 
for more than a year or two, it's not the best 
idea to keep the same administration in the top 
job for more than one year. It's just too sti-
fling. 

Guevara's commitment to diversity is 
also in his favor. The issue of 
underrepresentation is important enough to 
warrant measures such as the Cross-Cultural 
Center. 

Our only worry in endorsing Guevara is 
that he could concentrate too much one the is-
sues of diversity and underrepresentation. 
However, thetc are enough different opinions 
on the A.S. to make sure that diversity isn't 
the only topic on the table.lfhe wins, we hope 
he keeps all points of view and priorities in 
mind. 

VIce PresIcIeIIt 
Adlnlnlst ... th,. 

The vice president administrative posi-
tion is the heart and soul of internal AS. af-
fairs, and as chair of the A.S. Council, is the 
most visible of the executive positions. Along 
with chairing council meetings, the V.P. Ad-
ministrative is responsible for setting council 
agendas, making all appointments to campus-
wide committees and chairing several commit-
tees outside of the council. 

Special Election Edi,ionThe UCSD Guardian 

OUR PICK: 
JOHN BARNES 

VICe PresUknt Administrative 

J.-. ..... is the incumbent of the 
category, which immediately gives him more 
experience in the office than each of the other 
candidates. He has served in the past as a col-
lege senator and has been involved in several 
campus-wide committees. This year Barnes 
kept a strong command over the often-chaotic 
council meetings, but was also responsible for 
advertising and chairing the failed Constitu-
tional Convention 

According to Barnes, critical issues fac-
ing students arc establishing further AS. au-
tonomy from the university, resolving the S0-
cial Security Number dilemma, creating a fea-
sible alternative housing program affordable 
to students., and negotiating the proposed 
Cross-Cultural Center. Barnes defends appar-
ent AS. dislike the center proposal, saying . 
sufficient time was not given to smooth out 
any problems. He believes the idea behind the 
proposal of a cross-cultural center is good, but 
that the specifics will create a disunity between 
students. 

1bough ••• .,.. de Ie ___ has never 
served directly on the A.S. council, she enters 
the election with a strong grass roots back-
ground. Her qualifications for the position in-
clude being chair of the Student Affirmative 
Action Committee (SAAC), University Cen-
ters Advisory Board representative, member of 
the SAAC five-year plan committee and past 
resident advisor. 

Her goals as V.P. administrative are to 
make effective committee appointments by 
advertising the positions in greater detail. de 
la Pena felt that all too often -these positions 
are inadequately advertised, and don't draw in 
enough talent. She also wanted to utilize the 
alternative media to advertise the AS. 

Elizebeth p .... comes into this race 
as an independent, without any student gov-
ernment experience outside of high school. 
Along with a strong skepticism for both affir-
mative action and a Cross-Cultural Center, 

Pang also wants to see a reduction in the Ac-
tivities Fee. She felt that students should pay 
only for the programs and activities they par-
ticipate in. . 

With little or no university level experi-
ence, Pang doesn't stand a snowball's chance 
in this race. Also, it was obvious that nobody 
told Pang that lowering the Activities Fee 
would be shooting the student body in the foot. 

Emelyn de la Pena comes from a strong 
grass-roots background, but like Pang she is 
an A.S. newcomer - she lacks A.S. experi-
ence. In contrast, Barnes knows the ropes. 
Barnes' obvious strength is his ability to effi-
ciently chair meetings, allowing as Jlttle free 
reign by council members as possible. He is 
an effective administrator - a definite plus in 
trying to maintain order in A.S. affairs. For 
these reasons, our endorsement goes to John 
Barnes. 

Vice Pr ...... nt FI...ace 
Vice president of finance controls the 

details of the A.S. budget, in particular alloca-
tions to student organizations. The v.P. fmance 
often works closely with commissioner of op-
erations to maintain and expand student busi-
nesses. This year, the V.P. finance was respon-
sible for dealing with student organizations in 
the wake of the Smith v. ReKents ruling. 

OUR PICK: 
SILVIA SPILIGOI 

VP Finance 

SlIYIe .n ..... has served as a Warren 
College senator and worked on the finance 
committee. Her goals include integrating 
SOLO/A.S. and generating additional revenue 
from off-campus sources for those student or-
ganizations which can no longer be funded due 
to the Smiths v. Regents ruling. In addition, she 
also stresses the need to find alternative fund· 
ing sources to offset the decline in A.S. income. 
When asked about raising the $13.50 student 
activity fee, she said that it would be a "last 
resort." 

Sfiligoi identifies A.S. autonomy and 

alternative student housing as the most impor-
tant issues the A.S. is currently dealing with. 
She says that she supports the concept and 
purpose of the Cross-Cultural Center, but does 
not "agree with the specifics." 

Jennl. C,.. is a two-time Warren 
senator, has served on the A.S. Finance Com-
mittee, Cultural Programming Board, Univer-
sity Center Advisory Board and has served as 
A.S. Outreach Manager in A.S. External Af-
fairs. Among Craig's primary goals arc de-
creasing the bureaucracy in the AS. funding 
process, providing more money to student or-
ganizations by cutting internal A.S. spending 
and seeking alternative funding sources for re-
ligious, political and ideological organizations. 
In addition to these issues, Craig is a strong 
advocate of the Cross-Cultural Center and 
UCSA lobbying efforts and highly critical of 
the current A.S. version of autonomy. 

Though Jennie Craig is highly qualified, 
having more experience in student government 
than Silvia Sfiligoi, she has one critical draw-
back: she is very much a partisan player. While 
this is appropriate and desirable for other p0-
sitions, v.P. finance is in the business of hand-
ing out the dough to student organizations and 
having "favorites" is potentially dangerous. It's 
true that even the most "apolitical" technociat 
will have her preferences, but this is much dif-
ferent than strong political ties to particular or-
ganizations and issues. From what we know 
of Sfiligoi, this is not the case. In addition to 
this critical advantage, Sfiligoi is known in AS. 
as being very efficient and effective in her job. 
We endorse Sfiligoi for the position. 

One of the most important positions on 
council, vice president external is responsible 
for dealing with outside groups, including state 
and local government, other colleges, commu-
nity-based organizations and high schools. A.S. 
external serves as a link to other UCS and CSUs 
to battle fee increases and as an important tool 
for student outreach and recruitment. 

OUR PICK: 
NAOMI FALK 

VP External Affairs 
...... ,elk has served on ExtemaJAf-

fairs as a office director and a system-wide and 
local lobbyist against fee increases. She has 
also worked on the UCSA, is a founding mem-
ber of the California Collegiate Coalition 
(Ceq and also served as an assistant student 
advocate. 

Falle's campaign centers around the dual 
objectives of using the office to fight encroacb-

OPINION 419 

ing fees hikes and expanding student outreach 
and recruitment efforts. In particular, Falk 
wants to implement financiaJ-aid peer coun-
selors and student-run retention programs, es-
tablish a council for student organizations, 
strengthen ties to the DCSA and push for 
greater student accessibility to regcall. She also 
wants to increase outreach to high schools and 
community colleges. Further, Falk sees the 
Cross-CuJturaI Center as a particularly critical 
step in addressing the issues of retention and 
recruitment. She criticizes the AS. autooomy 
proposal as being "status quo," and she is ex-
tremelyangry about some council members' 
desire to pull out of UCSA - what she calls 
theA.s. 's greatest asset and the student', only 
voice in trying to counter UC fee inc:reases. 

Falk's challenger, .,... Woo is cur-
rently the Warren College Council President 
and has served on the council for the last two 
years. \lbo is running for Vice President Ex-
ternal because she thinks that AS. External is 
in disarray and that abe can sUClCCSSfully reor-
der its priorities. In particular, she believes that 
the office has become too fOCUled 00 the UCSA 
and lobbying against fees, and that outreach 
and recruitment have been ignored. While \bo 
thinks that pulling out of the UCSA would be 
"hasty," sbc wants to restructure AS. External 
and make it more accountable to students. In 
terms of campus-wide issues, \lbo has been • 
vocal critic of the Cross-CuJturaJ Center pr0-
posal, calling it both exclusionary anct COItly. 
However, she hopes that members of the AS. 
and the Cross-Cultural Center Coalition will 
be able to sit down and discuss the proposal. 

Aside from the lack of hands-on experi-
ence, the primary problem with Irene \bo is 
her seemingly slack attitude toward the rising 
costs of higher education. During her GlMJrd-
ian interview, she acknowledged the problem, 
but said that "there is nothing we can do" about 
it and that in light of budget constraints fee 
increases were "ralrly reasonable." ThiS type 
of so-what attitude is precisely what we need 
to avoid in a vice president external. 

Naomi Fait, in addition to having a wide 
breadth of experience, bas a clearly articulated 
and well-thought~ut agenda for AS. Exter-
nal. FallCs ideas are innovative and she strikes 
a good balances between the two primal)' func-
tions of the office - outreadl and system-wide 
representation. And of critical importance, she 
is dedicated to fighting fee increases. We give 
our recommendation to Naomi Falt. We be-
lieve she will do an excellent job as vice presi-
dent external.

Monday, April 4, 1994 Special Election EditionThe UCSD Guardian OPINION 419 

OUR PICK: 
PONCHO GU!VARA 

Presitknt 

PII.II .... " ... a Warren CoUege 
student, bas been involved with campus lead-
ership pc»ilions since his first week on cam-
pus. serving on die AS. and on his college 
council. In addition. Guevara bas worked 
claeely with several of the underrepresented 
groups 011 campus, culminating with a stint as 
c:IIair of die Student Affirmative Action Com-
mittee (SAAC) last year. 

Guevara wants to increase the number 
of undetlqllCleOted students at UCSD, a goal 
be said be would work toward as president. 

Acc:ordin& to Guevara, ways to increase 
miDority earoUmeot and retention include bet-
ter OUbea and recruitment and the founding 
of die Croa-Cultural Center, which be has 
pusbed for from his position at SAAC. 

n.e Crou-CuItura1 Center has created a 
peat deal of controversy within the AS. and 
IOIDC ltudentorpnizatioos rec:eody, with some 

quo, since it allows a chancellor's veto. 
Guevara bas the trust of student leaders, 

as evidenced by his selection as one of three 
candidates for student regent He promised to 
be a grass-roots president, more in touch with 
his consti~nts than the current A.S. 

Cerl. T •• ek, a Warren College 
junior, is the incumbent. She was forced into 
the presidential slot last year after being elected 
to the vice president administrative position 
when the president-clect was found ineligible 
for office. Remarkably, she managed to accom-
plish some of her goals despite her unusual 
ascent to power. . 

Tesalt said she worked on issues that af-
fect all students over the last year, including 
pushing for affordable housing on campus, in-
creasing student privacy by discontinuing the 
university's use of social security numbers and 
increasing A.S. autonomy. 

While greater A.S. autonomy might 
not seem to ben~fit the student population 
at large, Tesak said very tangible bonuses 
will be eminent once the autonomy agree-
ment is in place. For example, benches and 
rain shelters could be placed at shunle stops 
without adhering to campus codes that 
would make them prohibitively expensive. 
Also, the A.S. could establish a late-night 
parking shuttie, which is now too expensive 
because drivers must be paid a certain wage 
under university codes. 

On the Cross-Cultural Center issue, 
Tesalt said the A.S. should help increase di-
versity on campus, but the plan originally sub-
mitted for the center will not meet that goal. 
Instead of making underrepresented students 
feel more welcome on campus, the center 
could further isolate them unless changes are 
made to the proposal, accoqJing to Tesak. 

On the issue of the UCSA, Tesalt seemed

Pang also wants to see a reduction in the Ac· 
tivities Fee. She felt that students should pay 
only for the programs and activities they par-
ticipate in. 

With Iinle or no university level experi-
ence, Pang doesn't stand a snowball's chance 
in this race. Also, it was obvious that nobody 
told Pang tbat lowering the Activities Fee 
would be sbooting the student body in the foot. 

Emelyn de la Pena comes from a strong 
grass-roots background, but like Pang she is 
an A.S. newcomer - she lacks A.S. experi-
ence. In contrast, Barnes knows the ropes. 
Barnes' obvious strength is his ability to effi-
ciently chair meetings, allowing as little free 
reign by council members as possible. He is 
an effective administrator - a definite plus in 
trying to maintain order in A.S. affairs. For 
these reasons, our endorsement goes to John 
Barnes. 

Vice President FlINIIIce

I PRESIDENT I 

Carla TESAK 
Slate: Student Unity 
Coalition 

I am tbe cumnt President of tbe 
Associated Students. Most people feel 
that we have ac:complisbed mllCb tbis 
year. Itbink that they IR right. We 
completed an agreement wbicb keeps 
the Co-ops on campus. We puttogetber 
a comprebensive proposal for alterna-
tive housing and submitted it to tbe 
Din:ctor of Housing and Dining 
Services. We Ire finisbing negotiations 
witb the administration for an 
Autonomy proposal wbicb will allow 
students greater control over our 
moneys, input about students' pay, a 
higb level of control over campus-wide 
undergraduate elections, a stronger 
Judicial Board tbat isn't as closely tied 
to tbe AS, and more. We put togetber a 
proposal to change Student ID 115 to I 
random number; tbis will protect 
students sin<:e Social Security numbers 
can be used to obtain masses of 
information about an individual. 

For tbe next year my overall goal 
would be to create student unity by 
coordinating alltbe different depart-
ments to work competently and quickly 
to address student issues. These are 
going to range from restrucluring 
financial aid to creating new large aI/-
campus programming events. I 
specifically would work completing the 
Autonomy agreement and continuing 
our work with Alternative Housing. I 
wou Id also work on establisbing Police 
complaint procedures that are more 
flexible and open to students. Lastly, I 
would continue to work on parking 
issues such as building centrally located 
parking structures. These are just a few 
of my ideas. 

We have done a great deal, but tbere 
is still a tremendous amount left to do. 
Please vote for Student Unity Coalition, 
and then try to gel involved in the 
campus any way tbat you can.

I bave a1wlys felt that activism and 
politics an: two separate 6elds, but tbat 
doesn't blve to be the case. I'm 
running for office because the issues 
I've been working on for the put tbree 
years should be addressed by our 
Student Government. I acknowledge 
tbe contributions A.S. blS made, but I 
also feel thlt many critical issues have 
been overlooked, sucb ·1S recruitment 
and retenlion of under repRsented 
populations, the need for a Cross 
Cultural Center and building a strong 
relationship between A.S. and all 
student organizations, wbich are tbe 
backbone of the University. 

I will work towards making A.S. 
less condescending to the general 
student body. I wanl to be a COIIncil 
member tbat any student would be 
comfortable approacbing to tall about

Let me begin by tbanking tbe 
Guardian and its readers for tbeir 
interest in campus elections. As a 
member of the Student Unity Coalition, 
I am elcited lbout tbe prospect of 
turning tbis student interest into positive 
aClion. Over the past year, the students 
of this campus allowed me to be their 
Vice President Administrative. During 
this time, I bave been a witness and an 
actor in a dramatic improvement in 
student representation. However, I have 
found areas in the studenl government 
structure at UCSD that could be 
enbanced in order to more unify 
students. In place of Ibe cumntly 
fragmented, disorganized system of 
Ippointing campus-wide committee 
repre·sentatives, I propose a more 
centralized system where the Associated 
Students and College Councils 
coordinite the recruitment, appoint-
melt, allll maintenance of campus-wide 
represenlllives. In order to make the 
A.S. more accessible 10 stacIe.1I, I plan 
to poll A.S. documelllS o. 1M Internet, 
as well as maintaiD a comprehensive 
Issue researcb library. De Student

The position of Commissioner of 
Academic Affairs bas been the most 
under-utilized position for studeDl 
advocacy at UCSD. This office bas two 
main cbarges. The first is to represelll 
studeDl views to the facnlty and 
Idmiailttation iD 1M IRa of academic 
policy. De aeCOllll is 10 initilte 
programs through proper channels tbat 
would be beneficial to students. 

By serving IS the Commissioner of 
Academic Affairs for the past term, I 
bave represented student interests on 
several issues. I argued beavily for tbe 
reinslitution of letter grades in Gospel 
Cboir, tbe maintenance of funding for 
tbe P.E. Department, student rights in 
academic dishonesty cases, upscaling of 
opportunities for students to get 
independent researcb positions, and the 
discontinuance of Social Security 
numbers IS student ID numbers. 

There are several projects tbat I 
bave been working on in the area of 
student advocacy that I will continue to 
work on if re-clccted. The most 
extensive amongst tbese are the 
extension of the drop cleadline/last day 
to cbange gmling option and the 
installation of an alternative grading 
option· MasslFail. I bave also been 
figbting to illClCase the llllit values of

If reelccfed, Park's pis are es-
seDlially a continuation of bel previ-
OIlS policies, in particular placing all 
of the media racks, getting A.S. ad 
sales off the ground and testing how 
well the new media clwter works. 

Challenging Park for commis· 
sioner of communications is 
Jonathan Schell, an A.S. outsider. 
While Schell has bad no experience 
in campus politics, he worked on 
both a newspaper and year book 
during high school. One of ScheU's 
primary goals is getting students 
involved in the A.S. While "over-
coming apathy" is difficult, he thinks 
that it is possible if the A.S. did 
more outreach and advertising. 

Like several candidates in this 
year's race, Jon Schell has little ex-
perience or knowledge of the posi· 
tion for which he i.s applying. 

In contrast, Park bas experience as 
both a member of the media commit· 
tee and nearly a year as commissioner 
of communications. While she began 
her tenure by attempting 10 radically 
hack media budgets, Park has since 
begun working with the various me· 
dia and has become more undersland-
ing of their needs. Despilc her rough

REFERENDA ROAD MAP, CONS'ITfU'I10N DmDE 
By Eric IohmIdt 
Editor In Chief 

The constitutional amendments 
and referendum questions on the 
ballot are often rather trivial, but 
this year several of the questions 
are important and could cost stu-
dents a lot of money if passed. 
' .. W. •• d. 

In the wake of the Smith v. 
Regents verdict, which prohibits 
the A.S. from funding political, 
ideological or religious organiza-
tions, several fee referendum ques-
tions have found their way to the 
ballot in addition to the normal 
referedum questions. 

These referenda allow students 
to give money to the groups that 
are no longer funded under Smith. 
Because the fees are voluntary, 
students don't need to worry about 
being charged extrL Chances are, 
most students will not choose to 
pay extra fees if given the oppor-
tunity, so the referenda may not 
have any real effect on funding of 
student organizations. The Guard-
ian strongly urges you to vote "yes" 
on all three fee referenda. 
, .. Qu ....... 1 

Do yOll support the e$tIlbiish-
ment of a voluntary student fee of 
$5.00 per qlumer to support the 
California Studem Public Interest 
Research Group (CALPIRG) at 
UC San Diego for the period of 
Fall 1994 through Spring 2000? 

CALPIRG, the student-run po-
litical group that focuses on the 
environment, voter registration, 
homelessness and other issues, 
recently reestablished itself on this 

campus. 
~lDfund1he~ 

will be paying forlobbyingof1he State 
LrP'1IhU'C, a full-time campus staffer 
and CAlJ'IRG projecIs. 
... Qu ...... 2 

Do you favor estllblishing a 
vollUllary fee (that can 110 longer 
be ftuuled by mandatory fees in 
light ofSmith v. Regents) at $1.001 
student/quarter, excluding sum· 
mers, beginning Fal~ 1994? 

This fee would fund student 
groups such as Amnesty Interna-
tional and religious groups, which 
arc no longer eligible for A.S. 
money under Smith. 
' .. Qu ...... 3 

Do you favor estllblishing a 
voluntary fee to support student 
lobbying activities at $3/student/ 
quarter, excluding summer, be· 
ginning Fal~ 1994? 

Before Smith, the AS. External 
Office and University of California 
Student Association (UCSA) spent 
much of their time lobbying on p0-
litical issues that affect students, 
such as fee inaeases. 

Because it is now illegal for these 
groups to use mandatory fees to 
fund lobbying efforts, students have 
lost their voice to the State Legisla-
ture and other groups. Without a 
group to advocate student issues 
before the politicians, students are 
more vulnerable than ever before. 

Of all the fee referenda, ques-
tion three is the most important. 
• .,.,......Qu ...... 

Thetworeferendaontheballotwill 
cmt studcnls ac.onsiderable amount of 
money in the form of irIcrc:Med fees 

and parking 00S1S. The Guardian 
scrongIy urges you ID vote "00" on 
bod! of Ihese measures. 
Que"" 1 

Do you support a marut-based 
approach JNlrlcing system for the 
UCSD campus? 

Under the proposed system, stu-
dents would pay more to park in 
spaces closer to their classes, while 
the cost of spaces further away 
would be reduced. 

There are several problems with 
this proposal. When faced wit~ 
the choice of paying a lot more for 
a close space or parking far away 
for very little, most students will 
undoubtedly pay less. This means 
less income for parking in the 
short-term, and ultimately in-
creased average rates. 

With more students opting for 
the distant spaces, lois should fill up 
more quickly, leading to a bigger 
hassle for students looking for park-
ing. The referendum will also in· 
crease the hassle by adding to and 
complicating parking regulations. . 
Queetloll2 

Do yOll support a wtlivoble fee 
for political/ideological student 
organizations and student lobby? 

This odious question will bilk 
students of hard-eamed money in 
the form of "waivable" fees. 

Following the Smith ruling, the 
university administration decided 
that fees for political, ideological 
or religious organizations could 
only be paid through the positive 
check-off method. That is, stu-
dents would check off a small box 
on their bills ifthey wish to pay the 

voluntary fees. 
If this measure passes, students 

will automatically be billed for vol-
untary fees unless they state other-
wise. Authors of the referendum say 
that the waivable fee method gar-
ners more money than positive 
check-off, but the reasons for this 
are simple. Students may simply not 
·see or understand the waiver. 

The waivable fee is a way to trick 
students into shelling out extra 
money. If students want to pay vol· 
untary fees, they can say so. Others 
should not be forced to pay. 
CoIIIIItutIoneI A ....... ata 

The amendments are usually 
silly, trivial additions to the A.S. 
constitution, but not this year -
most actually do something sub-
stantial. Some could profoundly 
affect A.S. politics.

for an opportunity to lIIC their stills to 
produce viable software; and !be odIer 
is A.S. Food Delivery. We hope to 
deliver food from off campus restau-
rants for a $.5 or so fee. This is primarily 
for tbe Residence Halls where suites or 
otber groups may divide tbe cost of 
delivery amongst students. 

Please elect stuc!ents who have In 
idel of what ha been going on over the 
past year so thlt we can move ahead 
instead of reinventing the wbeel. We 
need your input, Ind we want students 
to be involved. Apply for a position on 
AS. or serve an hour or two per week 
with a student organization. UCSD has 
a reputation for being a bummer place 
to be, with your help we can try to make 
it a little less of one. 

Thanks you, Ind remember to vote 
for Student Unity Coalition.

Currently lam the Junior Senator and on 

!be Revelle College Council, AS. Media and 
Finance commillccs. I have also lobbied !be 
legisllture to reduce fees. 

There are many issues concerning student 
autonomy and I want to insure Revelle'S 
interests are addressed. I would like to sec 
large events at RIMAe such IS March 
Madness, concerts, and the Unolympics. I 
would like to have tbe sound system at 

RIMAC upgraded to concert-quality, and get new intramural equipment for 
students. Under Smith v Regents we must continue to find ways 10 fund all student 
organizations. 

I want to maintain Revelle 's traditions, i.e., Broomball, Ren-Faire, Cuino 
Night, Bailie of tbe Bands, and tbe Watermelon Drop. I BEUEVE THAT OUR 
FEES SHOULD BE REnJRNED TO US THROUGH THESE TYPES OF 
EVENTS.
