Students, Workers Unite Against UC Wage Disparity

By Jesse Alm
Associate News Editor

Hundreds of UCSD students and 
employees assembled yesterday on 
Library Walk to protest UC patient-care 
technical and service worker wages, 
which have been a growing source of 
contention since contract negotiations 
began more than 10 months ago.

Demonstrators chanted, waved 
placards and gave brief speeches in a 
march that culminated with the chain 
of protesters encircling Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox’s office complex.

“We are fighting for humanity; we 
are fighting for justice,” Associate Vice 
President of Local Affairs Erin Brodwin 
said through a megaphone. “We are 
concerned about tragedies abroad, but 
let’s talk about the injustices that are 
happening right here at UCSD.”

According to the American 
Federation of State, County and 
Municipal Employees — the union that 
represents the workers — salaries for the 
university’s patient-care technical staff 
have fallen 25 percent below the state 
average, and service workers make as lit-
tle as $10 per hour. Thurgood Marshall

The new housing project under-
going construction on North Campus 
behind the Eleanor Roosevelt College 
dormitories will be the first on-cam-
pus housing built specifically for 
transfer students. 

Officially titled the Village at 
Torrey Pines West, the new housing 
complex will replace approximate-
ly five acres of land that formerly 
served as campus parking lots.

“The project will include 370,000 
gross square feet for student and 
staff living units as well as a variety 
of retail space, including a satellite 
bookstore and small cafe, admin-
istration offices, meeting and con-
ference facilities, laundry, mail and 

other life-enhancing amenities,” said 
Rob Batt, the associate director of 
planning and construction for UCSD 
Housing, Dining and Hospitality

Two student members of the campus 
free-speech revision committee trekked 
to UCLA on May 28 to attend a public 
hearing on the proposed University 
Office of the President regulations for 
nonaffiliate speech and activity.

The forum was scheduled for the 
public to comment on a new set of 
restrictions governing the speech, 
assembly and literature distribution 
of nonaffiliated community members. 
Among the new regulations is a clause 
prohibiting the public from gather-
ing or demonstrating on university 
grounds without prior approval. 

Anticipating large crowds and 
public protest, Tara Ramanathan and 
Carol-Irene Southworth were disap-
pointed to find only about 10 people 
present among rows of vacant chairs.

attendance, saying that it had clearly 
not informed the UC community as 
much as it should have.

Southworth and Ramanathan — the 
only students at the meeting — attend-
ed to voice concerns and seek answers 
to uncertainties about the policy.

While there have been rumors 
that the proposed regulations came 
in response to problems at UC Santa 
Barbara, UC Santa Cruz and UC 

Berkeley, UCOP spokesman Trey Davis 
said the new policy produced disrup-
tions on all campuses and is an attempt 
to create a systemwide standard for the 
speech and activity of nonaffiliates.

“I’m sure you could say that the last 
thing that happened [on any campus] 
could be responsible for the [proposed 
regulations], but they were not prompt-

distaste for rising fees, which he said 
only pad administrative salaries.

He said many students have trouble 
finding seats in classes, and urged stu-
dents and employees to hold the admin-
istration accountable for leaving both 
groups at the bottom of its agenda.

Nguyen cited incoming UC 

President Mark G. Yudof ’s $828,000 
annual compensation package, Fox’s 
$8,916 auto allowance and UCSD CEO 
Richard Liekweg’s recent 20.2-percent 
wage hike and $70,105 bonus as evi-
dence of a top-heavy university budget.

ed by any single, particular incident,” 
Davis said.

While rules are already in place for 
students and staff, the university has 
encountered problems when local cit-
ies or district attorneys try to prosecute 
incidents involving nonaffiliates who 
are not governed by campus policies, 
Davis said.

While the UCOP proposal does not 
directly restrict student activity, it may 
hamper public-led efforts, Ramanathan 
said.

“Our ability to increase movements 
and make them widespread is entirely 
dependent upon the opportunity to 
reach the community,” she said.

One group that would be affect-
ed by the proposed regulations is the 
American Federation of State, County 
and Municipal Employees, the union 
representing UC patient-care and ser-
vice workers, which has been involved 
in an ongoing negotiation about wages 
and pensions, Southworth said.

“With the shameful way the UC 
is engaging in negotiations … we abso-
lutely need nonaffiliates to retain their 
civil rights to demonstrate and take 
political action to protest injustice,” 
Southworth said.

UC patient-care and service work-
ers oppose the regulations because of 
the impact they could have on bargain-
ing and maintaining workers’ rights, 
AFSCME President Lakesha Harrison 
said in an e-mail.

“[The regulations] are deeply trou-
bling on First Amendment grounds 
and also because they propose to crimi-
nalize a wide range of activities that 
union staff members and communi-
ty supporters engage in on a regular 
basis in support of UC workers’ rights,” 

Policy Could Criminalize 
Unions’ On-Campus Activities
▶ POLICY, from page 1 Harrison said.

AFSCME has demanded that the 
university complete bargaining with 
the union before implementing the 
policy.

Davis said the university would 
undergo a careful review of all public 
comments made at the meeting along 
with any written comments submit-
ted to the Office of General Council. 
Once the review process is complete, 
the proposed regulations will be 
sent to the UC Board of Regents for 
approval.

Although the next regents meeting 
is scheduled for July, Davis said that 
UCOP still does not anticipate seeking 
policy approval before September.

Considering that UCSD released its 
free-speech policy for public input dur-
ing finals week of  last year, Ramanathan 
said she is worried the regents will 
approve the policy over the summer 
while classes are not in session.

 “We can never be too sure of 
[when the policy will be approved],” 
Ramanathan said. “We need students 
to keep on [UCOP officials’] asses and 
make sure that they do not try to have 
that meeting over the summer.”

Ramanathan added that the only 
way to prevent the regents from approv-
ing the policy is by mobilizing students 
to attend their meeting.

“In my experience with the UC, 
when enough students show interest 
in an issue, they will feel the pressure 
to do something,” she said. “It cannot 
just be only [the students on the revi-
sion committee] defending free speech. 
We all have to be part of this, [because] 
nobody will do it for us.”

Prompted by phone calls from wor-

had visited the Ucar residence twice 
in the past two weeks but, after look-

doors, found nothing suspicious.

“Everything was closed up,” Giudice

In Year’s Final Meeting, Council 
Discusses Current Free-Speech Issues

The A.S. Council met last night for its final meeting before summer vacation, although the 
rainy weather outside did not fit the 
occasion. Councilmembers considered 
a handful of long-term issues, all of 
which will still be waiting for them 
come September. 

Tara Ramanathan and Carol-
Irene Southworth, student representa-
tives from a subcommittee to review 
the campus free-speech policy, spoke 
during public input. Administrators at 
UCSD made a failed attempt last year to 
impose new speech restrictions on stu-
dents, faculty and nonaffiliates. In the 
fallout, Ramanathan and Southworth 
have worked with 
other committee 
members to formu-
late an alternative 
policy proposal.

The two rep-
resentatives have 
periodically visited 
meetings to keep 
councilmembers updated, but last night 
they indicated that a new policy pro-
posal from the University of California 
Office of the President could severely 
compromise the progress they’ve made 
so far.

“We think that that they’re very 
dangerous to first amendment rights,” 
Southworth said of the proposed pol-
icy’s restrictions. Southworth said that 
the proposal would give the univer-
sity the power to require prior approval 
before nonaffiliates hold demonstra-
tions, teach-ins or instructional rallies 
on university property. As a system-
wide UCOP policy it would also over-
ride campus-level efforts to maintain a 
more liberal free-speech policy. 

Ramanathan said that she hopes 
UCOP will postpone a vote on the pol-
icy until the fall instead of addressing it 
during the summer months. Were that 
to be the case, UCSD would return from 

vacation with two free-speech policies 
to juggle since the development of the 
campus proposal has not proceeded as 
quickly as originally planned.

“We don’t want to put our names 
on something that we’re not entirely 
comfortable with,” said Southworth of 
the campus policy proposal. 

Next on the list of revisions was the 
2009 Sun God Festival. Associate Vice 
President of Programming Garrett 
Berg reported that “around 20 stu-
dents” in addition to A.S. councilmem-
bers attended a public forum earlier in 
the day about next year’s festival.

“We got a lot of feedback and it 
wasn’t a lot of personal attacks, so that 

was good,” Berg 
said, alluding to 
Facebook com-
ments that have 
sharply criticized 
his office’s plan-
ning of last year’s 
festival and the 
council’s subse-

quent appointment of Berg. He said 
that there will be another forum in the 
fall to solicit more student feedback.

Associate Vice President of Athletic 
Relations Peter Benesch also referenced 
Sun God, saying that next quarter will 
give the council an opportunity to “dis-
pel the myth that all A.S. does is just 
Sun God.” Benesch urged the council 
to utilize events held during welcome 
week and the first week of instruction 
to improve A.S. visibility.

“The blue shirts must be present,” 
he said, referring to the navy-blue polos 
that councilmembers receive.

And so the council adjourned last 
night, leaving plenty on its student gov-
ernment plate. Sun God, free speech, 
and A.S. visibility will sit under the 
heat lamps over the summer, along-
side many other delicious issues, from 
tuition fees to organization funding to 
student representation.

Services.
The complex will consist of sev-

eral three- and four-story buildings 
alongside a 14-story tower. It will be 
the first housing area on campus to 
offer undergraduates the option of 
entering a 12-month housing con-
tract, as opposed to the nine-month 
option currently available for all 
other on-campus housing.

University officials are pro-
moting on-campus housing as a 
cost-efficient housing option in the 
expensive San Diego region while 
attending UCSD. 

“A report on undergraduate 
student experience and satisfac-
tion submitted to the chancellor 
in September 2005, by a committee 
mainly comprising UCSD students, 
emphasized the academic advan-
tages of living on campus, especial-
ly for transfer students,” Batt said. 
“The project will increase the sup-
ply of affordable student housing, 
and its cost benefits will become 
more pronounced over time.”

The project will be open for stu-
dent occupancy by September 2009, 
Project Manager Mark Rowland 
said.

“There have been no glitches 
in construction, and the project is 
running on schedule,” he said.

New Housing to Accommodate Student Overflow
▶ CONSTRUCTION, from page 1 According to Rowland, the 

project, which utilizes the “design-
build” methodology in which the 
contractor and architect team work 
together to complete the design of 
the project and prepare the con-
struction documents, is proceeding 
rapidly. 

“While it might have seemed to 
those unfamiliar with the design-
build process that the project was 
taking longer to get off the ground 
than usual construction projects, in 
reality, the project was proceeding 
as fast as or even faster than a tra-
ditional design-bid-build project,” 
Rowland said.

The new housing buildings will 
provide approximately 1,800 beds, 
built apartment-style, and will be 
available to undergraduate students 
affiliated with any of the six UCSD 
colleges, Batt said.

On-campus housing for incom-
ing transfer students is not cur-
rently guaranteed, as first-year stu-
dents and continuing students are 
given higher priority, according to 
HDHS. Transfer students can put 
down their name on a wait list and 
hope for a vacancy, but have no 
guarantee of on-campus housing.

First-year students who are 
admitted for Winter Quarter, who 
may already have upper-division 

standing because of previous higher 
education elsewhere, are also not 
guaranteed housing. 

Citing high demand for on-cam-
pus housing, as well as an expected 
100 percent occupancy rate for fall 
2008, HDHS usually recommends 
that these students search for resi-
dences that are located off campus.

“The project will provide an 
increased supply of affordable 
housing for transfer and upper-
division students, and enhance the 
recruitment and retention of these 
students,” Batt said.

Over the last 10 years, new stu-
dent enrollment has increased 39 
percent, with 70 percent of new stu-
dent enrollments consisting of first-
time freshmen, according to UCSD 
admissions statistics. Housing ser-
vices expects to place 65 percent of 
first-year freshmen in triple-occu-
pancy rooms.

The North Campus housing 
project is not the only student hous-
ing project in the planning stages 
for future students. 

“There are four other hous-
ing projects of various magnitude 
currently in the design stages,” 
Rowland said.

groups that the rally, originally sched-
uled to coincide with the strike, would 
still occur.

“The UC administration is just try-
ing to delay this for as long as possible 
and divide the students and workers,” he 
wrote. “They want to drag this until after 
finals so that students will not be heard.”

Jorge Olvera, a UCSD grounds-
keeper of 23 years who serves on the 
AFSCME service-worker bargaining 
team, said leaving people in poverty 

creates moral and economic problems.
“In a way, they are creating this 

budget crisis,” he said. “They might as 
well just give new employees a business 
card that tells them how to get on pub-
lic assistance. If you have more money, 
you will pay more taxes. It’s a cycle. For 
them to hide behind the state budget is 
not OK with us anymore.”

Lead university spokeswoman 
Stacie A. Spector said Fox recognizes 
the university’s urgent need to compro-
mise with the union.

“It is the chancellor’s fervent hope 
that a mutually agreeable contract will 
be reached soon between AFSCME 
and the Office of the President,” she 
said in an e-mail. “UC San Diego’s 
employees are among our greatest 
assets, and Chancellor Fox is eager for 
negotiators for both UC and AFSCME 
to come together and reach an accord 
that will benefit our employees.”

FREEDOM TO FESTIVALS: 2007-08 IN REVIEW



THURSDAY, JUNE 5, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5

“Even if none of the 427 grade altera-
tions were deliberate — a very unlikely 
scenario, according to the auditors — it 
doesn’t retroactively absolve Preuss 
administrators for allowing these prob-
lems to go unnoticed for many years.”

Jan. 14, 2008

“The governor may think that by push-
ing a stranglehold on state spending 
he’s delivering on his no-tax-increase 
promise to California citizens, but in 
reality he’s failed miserably. All he’s 
really done is insidiously dump it in the 
hands of overburdened students so that 
he can turn a blind eye and come out 
looking like the good guy to taxpayers. 
And for that, he should be ashamed.”

“And that’s the hardest part, isn’t it? In a day and age where we dread over-shares and covet personal space, who wants to take on any more things? Who wants to be a magnet for things outside their trust circle or beyond their safety net?”BY CHARLES NGUYEN • EDITOR IN CHIEF 2007-08 • MANAGING EDITOR 2006-07 • NEWS EDITOR 2005-06
And that’s what my brother and I 

treasure most from that memory. It 
wasn’t the series of heart implosions 
that started with Jerome Bus Bettis 
fumbling, followed by Big Ben tackling 
and ended with Vander-jacked missing. 
It wasn’t breaking Carson Palmer’s leg. 
It wasn’t even the eventual Super Bowl 
beatdown of the Seattle Seahawks. 

What my brother would have me 
remember most is that single, excitable 
moment preceding every successful 
campaign, in life and in football. I’ve 
eyed many prizes that were over my 
head and stepped into many tough 
situations deemed unfitting for my 
permissive nature. And that’s when 
that moment occurs, always bringing 
up a firm answer to boil: Bring it.

I imagine that thought occurred to 
me a lot as editor in chief. I imagine 
the Steelers thought it a lot before they 
blazed their path toward Super Bowl 
XL. And I imagine my brother (to 
whom I dedicate this piece for his ever-
lasting lessons of manhood, dedica-
tion, diligence and integrity), used the 
thought to surpass a poor and father-

less life by scoring a high-paying job in 
Japan before dropping it all to return 
and care for my then-sick mother.

My brother’s story is one of instinct, 
led by toughness. As the immature 
short-cutter he always reamed me for 
being, I amended his lesson a bit. The 
original probably sounded like, “Bring 
it on. The success comes later, if it ever 
comes at all. Do it anyway.”

And that’s the hardest part, isn’t 
it? In a day and age where we dread 
over-shares and covet personal space, 
who wants to take on any more things? 
Who wants to be a magnet for things 
outside their trust circle or beyond 
their safety net?

Journalists do. My brother’s lessons 
gifted me with a unique reaction to 
problems: Run toward them. An attrac-
tion to problems, for whatever reason 
(the impending challenge, excitement 
of the chase, full-on masochism), is 
a journalist’s defining characteristic. 
It is the common characteristic in all 
Guardian staffers that will always leave 
me flustered with pride and honor. 
I’ve met some of the most forward-

looking, captivating, inventive and pio-
neering minds at the Guardian, and 
they all have, at one time or another, 
flanked me while I blindly made my 
run at problems. This piece seconds as 
paltry attempt at thanking all of them 
for being journalists — and running 
with me. 

To 2007-08: I know our road has 
been an unconventional one, espe-
cially being led by the little-brother 
type editor. What I lacked in poise 
and assurance I tried to make up for 
in hard work, openness and humor. 
It probably ended up a big mashup 
anyhow, so all apologies. If I seemed 
cold, I was trying to be quietly strong. 
If I seemed overbearing, I was just 
trying to be convincingly firm. If I 
seemed depressed, I was just trying to 
be solemnly contemplative. If I seemed 
distant, I was just trying to avoid you 
seeing me drunk and/or high (j/k!). 

The yearlong erosion of my char-
acter brings to mind the headline of a 
farewell column of a fellow editor: “In 
which she swears she’s not a bitch.” I 
feel your pain, girl.

The most appropriate courtesy 
would be to recall something I tell my 
sister in heartfelt conversations, and 
often I think it’s the only kind thought 
that keeps Sophia forgiving my faults. 
I’ll repeat it to you now, to thank you 
all for being brothers and sisters that 
have taught me, nurtured me, com-
forted me and supported me: I hope I 
made you proud.

To 2006-07: We started many things 
together, from an advisory board to an 
alumni reunion to a new Web site. 
Every single thing was a building 
block; nothing this year would have 
been possible without your hand-built 
foundations. Cheers to Heather for 
leading the pack with her sharpness, 
Andrew for keeping me down to earth 
with his harassment and the rest of the 
crew for being my fire and fuel for the 
job of a lifetime. To the business folks 
Anna and Mike, who abided the staff ’s 
youthful spunk that was no doubt at 
times relentless. You guys made me 
want to achieve and build something 
special with our little newspaper.

To 2005-06: My experience being 
journalistically raised in what I now 
dub the “Golden Age of Guardian” 
became not only the touchstone that 
I regularly retreated to this year for 
inspiration, but also formed a crucial 
part of my still-in-progress coming 
of age. That was the year I discov-
ered a world outside my home, where 
questions flew, everything was dirtied 
by sin and all you needed to prove 
yourself was the guts to deliver. The 
scandal that was Steve York’s televised 
cock, and the reporting I did on it, 
would have been nothing if not for the 
tutelage and guidance of my manag-
ers at the time: Vlad, Ian and Grant. 
In fact, I still look on this year’s staff 
with the warmness a policeman would 
feel when recalling why he entered 
the force. You guys are the reason I 

will always write; it’s a practice that is 
surprisingly unnatural to me but I do 
anyway, because it forces me to chal-
lenge myself, value introspection and 
be inquisitive.

To the longest of friends and group-
ies: Rael, who held down Guardian 
gangster-ism with a cooled sensibil-
ity I’ve always admired. Danai, who 
had the kindness to pay me unde-
served compliments. Richard, whose 
high tolerance for our late nights and 
my editorial fuckups always gave me 
something to lean on. Utako, whose 
ever-disarming charm was a welcome 
thing to any dark Guardian day. All 
the sloshball players in this year’s 
championship Guardian team, I hope 
Ichiro’s lead-offs and subsequent barf-
ing proved that not all journalists are 
squares. Matt L, whose perfection set 
a new set of standards. Serena, who 
had the guts to tackle a position, and 
then more

To the Guardian’s newest class: My 
happiest moments are yet to come. 
They’ll happen next year, when I see 
you guys developing, growing and 
blossoming to heights I know I could 
have never even conceived myself. To 
Matt, for being the gravity that attracts 
so much of our talent, energy and, 
most importantly, good fucking times. 
To Hadley, one of the strongest women 
I know; I should take cues, girl. To 
Reza, for undoubtedly keeping ghetto

Iheard the warnings but I didn’t believe them. I didn’t think the Guardian had the power to take 
over my college life. But more and more 
I found myself skipping class to conduct 
interviews, doing late-night research 
rather than studying — or partying 
— and cranking out articles instead of 
sleep.

However, looking back, the stress, 
criticism and caffeinated delirium were 
well worth it. On a campus twice the 
size of my hometown, this college news-
paper is where I found my place, my 
interest and my voice. 

I first walked in to the Guardian’s 
Student Center office winter of my 
sophomore year. 

Leaving sports behind in high school 
except for a quick stint as a UCSD cheer-
leader (which I quit), it is ironic that my 
early involvement revolved around the 
UCSD athletics program. 

What started out as an investiga-
tion into the underfunded, oft-ignored 
department became a story of debt, 

threats of team cuts and rumors of 
an approaching fee referendum. The 
athletics beat is where I first discov-
ered the inner workings of the campus, 
where academic prowess prevails at the 
expense of student life and UCSD has 
loyalty to a system with political and 
economic interests of its own.

But it was the UC compensation 
scandal, the D.O.C. protests, union 
negotiations, rising tuition costs and 
the free-speech policy issue that really 
showed me an institution more like a 
business than a university. However, the 
Guardian has provided an autonomous 
forum for students like myself to criti-
cally think about the issues that directly 
affect us. While I’ll be the first to admit 
that the paper can be biased, at least 
every bias is guaranteed to be student 
slanted, representing the research and 
interpretation of students alone, rather 
than being filtered through the admin-
istration or influenced by outside forces. 

While news has been a somber, 
although exciting venture, working for 

the Focus section this year has opened 
up the positive side of campus, com-
mitted to many worthy causes from 
humanitarian efforts to the environment 
and offering a wide variety of activities 
that have potential to make any student 
feel at home.

The most rewarding part, however, 
is the crazy bunch of talented writ-
ers, artists and leaders that I have met 
through the Guardian, whose mix of 
backgrounds, ethnicities, sexual ori-
entations and opinions have given me 
insight that I couldn’t have found else-
where. I am grateful for each of you who 
have guided me, challenged me, made 
me laugh or taken a dropkick in the 
stomach for me! I will greatly miss the 
late nights, the singing, the inside jokes, 
the themed parties at Matt’s house and 
staring at those filled bins every Monday 
and Thursday morning, admiring what 
we have accomplished. Among the 
many things I am proud of doing dur-
ing my time at UCSD, the Guardian will 
always rank at the top.

{

There are countless farewells that go out to people whenev-er you finish one leg of a jour-
ney and then take one of the many 
forks in the road. For me, the people 
I’d wish to say thanks and goodbye 
know who they are, but goodbye isn’t 
even the right word. There are people 
you will stay in contact with and 
people who will disappear into the 
fabric of life. I hope to stay in contact 
with these people I’d say farewell 
to; in which case, farewell’s com-
pletely inappropriate since it implies 
some finality to this whole adventure. 
Maybe a simple “later” would do 
better — as in: we’ll continue this 
conversation later, this meal later, 
this trip later. “Later” loops around in 
infinity. “Goodbye” settles scores.

I’d measure my time at college as a 
bust. UCSD beat me up in a few ways 
that have left me changed, even if I see 
it only minutely. There’s better scope 

and better foresight now, but consid-
erable doubt combating my idealism. 
I’ve been up and down trying to share 
my love of film with people, whether 
in person or in articles, and most 
of the time I’ve halted myself from 
saying I want to be a filmmaker. I 
love creating stories. I love moving 
images and how people respond to 
them. These words become difficult 
to say when the response is apathetic 
cynicism like “it’s not what you know, 
it’s who you know.” They’re an end-
lessly idealistic words, but they’re also 
shrouded in a personal doubt that 
says, “no, not today, junior.” Because 
there are a million other people out 
there with similar dreams in count-
less fields, and are all of them going to 
do it? Probably not, and that’s when 
it starts getting a little scary. That’s 
where you start to battle yourself, 
to try and overcome the negative 
while pressing on, and never giving 

the excuse of “someday.” Because the 
actual someday may never come; all 
that we have is now. Now is the time 
to stop saying the words and work to 
make it real. At the end of the day, 
what’s real counts, right?

This “farewell” column isn’t 
designed to be some Debbie Downer 
series of musings. In fact, through 
a lot of the good, mediocre and all-
around crap that we all endure, there’s 
a sense that this stuff, this doubt, has 
to happen in order for us to go from 
point A to point B. In that sense, I, 
along with you and that person sit-
ting across from you on the shuttle, 
need UCSD as our developmental 
background. So, while you may hate 
it, you at least have to appreciate it a 
little. Take it all in, all of UCSD, and 
search for your balance. And to para-
phrase the words of Warren Beatty’s 
senator in “Bulworth,” have a drink 
and live your life.

Unlike a number of my co-work-ers, I’ve never wanted to pursue journalism professionally. In 
fact, I stumbled upon my first job at the 
Guardian somewhat accidentally at the 
end of my freshman year: A friend of 
mine was just finishing up his term as 
the A.S. Council beat writer and men-
tioned offhandedly that they needed 
someone to replace him. The news staff 
was pretty small, he told me, and since 
I was a writing major, I might want to 
give it a shot.

With no real knowledge of what I 
was getting myself into, I submitted a 
news application and became the A.S. 

columnist within a few days. At the 
start, all I had to do was attend one 
weekly meeting and compile a bullet-
point summary of what happened. It 
was easy. I didn’t think there’d be a very 
steep learning curve.

What I quickly discovered from 
working in the news section was that, 
for the first time in my writing career, 
my words actually mattered. Not that 
my column was a vehicle for change or 
anything so concrete — I still say only 
councilmembers, the copy editor and 
my mother ever read it — but choosing 
accurate, concise words became para-
mount. In my classes, it had always been 

about volume: How many words I wrote 
mattered much more than what they 
actually said. And looking back on some 
of my old articles, I can’t believe how 
many I wasted.

I remained at the Guardian for the 
next three years because journalism 
challenged me more than any other type 
of writing. I applied for advancement 
within the section because I found I 
enjoyed this challenge. Being news edi-
tor is a 24/7 job; you always have to be 
on alert for the stories that are passing 
you by, even when real life is hitting you 

Renner

Wendy, first of all, for tak-ing my cookies, beating me up and otherwise being the 
best person I could ever ask to spend 
my time with. Darin, for struggling 
with living with me for the past three 
years; we all know that trying to prove 
me wrong is a full time commitment! 
Jessica, thanks for being a super-cool 
pseudo twin, and thank your sister 
for me too. Charlie for doing drugs 
over the bathroom sink in Vegas and 
then profusely bleeding and telling me 
“Richard, don’t to do drugs” — don’t 
worry, I won’t. But you’ve thrown down 
for four years, you have a gem there 
Mr. Nguyen, guard it carefully. Danai, 
for being someone who won’t fucking 
motherfucking shut the fuck up Danai 
(you know what I mean), but for reals, 
you’ve been a good man all these years, 
take care of yourself. Andrew, I’m not 
sure how many rolled tacos and bur-
ritos we’ve eating together, but I’m sure 
it’s a lot. Rael, if you behave yourself, I’ll 

let you lick my butt too, but seriously, I 
had fun working with you the past few 
years. Matt McA for being the chillest 
and throwing awesome house parties, 
you have Mr. Nguyen’s gem, guard it 
carefully. The Yipster for being my 
Sunday meal ticket on occasion and 
sometimes on Thursday too, let me 
know if you need anymore tutoring, 
I’ll hook it up. Emily, for proving me 
right in hiring you, you’ll do great next 
year, tear some shit up for me. All the 
down to earth badass motherfuckers in 
wushu that spend the time to teach me. 
Sonia for being so fucking awesome 
in design, thank you for ripping that 
motherfucker apart this year. Chris K. 
for understanding me and my video 
games. Chris M. for being the best story 
teller I’ve ever seen. Grant, you were a 
tool, but you were everyone’s tool. Ian, 
I’ve never met a man in the Guardian 
(besides Clayton) that I respected more 
than you. And everyone, for having to 
put up with my behavior.

SP ORTS  ED ITOR  20 0 5 -20 0 8

When I came to UCSD a bright-eyed freshman four years ago, I knew nothing of what I was about to go 
through or who I was to become, but I knew 
I wanted to cover sports for the Guardian. 
While I was confident that sports journalism 
was my passion, I had no idea that the work 
I did for the sports section and the people I 
worked with over the years would shape my 
college experience more than the classes ever 
could.

As I prepare to enter the real world and 
become an “adult” — whatever that’s supposed 
to mean today — I feel prepared because of 
the lessons, social and professional, that I’ve 
learned from my time at the official campus 
newspaper. 

I became sports editor at the start of my 
sophomore year, taking over for a graduating 
senior named Matt Grant. He taught me how 
to do this job well while also finding time to 
enjoy the perks that come with it (i.e. me and 
my associate sports editor/No. 1 mope homie 
Danai going to see Tiger Woods at the U.S. 
Open after finals with press passes). In my 
predecessor’s honor, as was Guardian senior 
sendoff tradition in years before, I will leave 
my pseudo-final will and testament.

To Charles-in-Charge — As Lil’ Wayne 
says, ‘NO HOMO,’ but you’re the Dre to my 
Snoop, the Manny to my Tony, the Sonny 
to my Michael (I know you ran shit around 
here, but I’m honoring Michael with my photo 
so you have to be Sonny). I leave my game-
worn, tattered sloshball wife beater from the 
championship. You know how important that 
is to me and you deserve it after your heroic 
showing in the sloshball tournament. We are 
the OGs here and we should be proud of what 
we accomplished.

To Danai — Like you said, it’s only just the 
beginning but I still leave my burned Wire 
DVDs and the promise that some day soon we 
will merge our handsome entrepreneur pow-
ers for profit once again. I can’t wait to eat free 

food with you at the Open and enjoy a summer 
back home in the City.

To Matt — I leave a promise for a truce on 
your mom jokes for life.

To Hadley — I leave (not really) Puff the 
bearded dragon.

To Reza — I leave my office TV, which was 
never really mine, to watch as many Giants 
and Warriors games as you can, plus the ID I 
already gave you. 

To Kim — I leave my bottles of 420 cleans-
er, so that Harold and whatever other office 
pieces are in the rotation can hit right.

To Jesse — I leave the sloshball captain-
manager duties now that I’m hanging up my 
cleats. Now that we’ve won a title, I expect you 
to start a dynasty because you’ve got the skills.

To Joe — I leave my dust to eat in the 
keeper league.

To Alyssa — I leave the understanding that 
Focus can never be as cool as Sports because 
it’s once a week and not on one of the covers.

To Richard — I leave Tiger Woods PGA 
Tour 2008 so you can practice and maybe beat 
me one day.

To Erik — Thanks for taking my sendoff 
photo and the most amazing shots the sports 
section has ever ran.

To every copy editor/reader and designer 
since I’ve been editor — I’m sorry my shit’s late 
but I’m just not a morning person. I leave you 
the promise that the newbies will be better.

To Neil and Janani and eventually Jake — I 
leave you the opportunity to improve the sec-
tion and also take advantage of the press passes 
and the unique work environment.

To my staff over the years — I leave know-
ing that my job would’ve been impossible 
without you all.

To anyone I forgot — I’m sorry but I’m 
pressed for time, spacey and word counts are a 
bitch but I love you all.

I’m out. Barry Bonds rules. GO GIANTS!

THURSDAY, JUNE 5, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN GRAD SECTION  15

Guardian alive next year. To Jesse, his-
tory’s best hippie ballplayer. To Kim, 
a down-ass chick. To Sonia, for her 
innate courage to always speak her 
mind. To Chris M., whose unrivaled 
knowledge of cinema was big enough 
to make my quoting of Denzel and 
Pacino somewhat enjoyable. To Chris 
K., whose originality and quip-filled 
character made him an artist in the 
truest sense. To Simone, for teaching 
me strength by never seeming as bur-
dened as me by her drive to work (I’m 
Debbie Downer without you, girl). To 
Alyssa, the impromptu editor whose 
kind but gutsy nature single-hand-
edly set a course for her section. To 
Nicole, who I know (as a fellow comic-
book lover) possesses pure unadulter-
ated imagination, a very rare quality in 
these disillusioned, see-it-to-believe-it 
days. To Teresa, who backs Rihanna 
just as feverishly as I do — now I’m not 
as ashamed, girl.

To the editorial critics: No career 
is without its potholes. From Sun God 
to SRTV, I’ve been at the butt end 
of administrative, political and stu-
dent-led fire many a time. My writing 
has seen me in a number of compro-
mising situations for a journalist. I’ve 
misquoted: In a union story a ways 
back, I mixed up a quote attribution 
between opposing parties. I’ve mis-
stated: In his second run at the A.S. 
presidency and my year as news edi-
tor, UCSD alum and political gadfly 
Daniel Watts ripped into me — furi-
ous to the near point of tears — for 
alleged misconceptions about his plat-
form and uncouth public handling 
of the death of his friend Benjamin 
Sumner, an A.S. councilmember. I’ve 
even reneged a whole piece: Last year, 
I wrote an Opinion column in which I 
retracted my two-star rating of Justin 
Timberlake’s “FutureSex/LoveSounds.” 
I know what you’re thinking: “What 
kind of journalist does that?” The 
answer: all of them. Expect mistakes 
from me, but also expect the humility 
that allows me to talk any issue out.  
E-mail, ask, prod, and represent your 
own community.

My brother has taught me just as 
much. His influence drove my comic-
book illustration on the preceding 
page.The vigorous spirit he instilled 
in me during childhood has grown 
into inescapable teenage yearning for 
nothing less than heroism — the stuff 
of films, comics and legends. I can take 
comfort in the fact that he first taught 
me to the ways of manhood before let-
ting me dream of heroes.

Then he taught me that a hero 
doesn’t make a man — one of life’s 
truest lessons. But Anh, I still want to 
be both.

His Thanks 

and Apologies

the hardest. Between covering SRTV 
sex scandals, bomb threats and Preuss 
School transcript irregularities, I found 
myself hooked on the knowledge I was 
accumulating about UCSD.

My jobs here cost me sleep, social 
interaction and a stress-free senior year. 
But, they also gave me many strong 
friendships, self-discipline and the 
knowledge that the next stage of my life 
— law school at UC Hastings — is with-
in my capabilities. I know of few college 
jobs that can offer the same benefits.

Plus, I can’t even explain how fun it is 
to aggravate administrators on a regular 
basis. Until you’ve tried it, you’ve never 
known what a rush feels like.

I am leaving the Guardian with fond 
memories of the people I have met and 
the work I have done here. Many thanks 
to all the people who have made this 
experience what it was for me. It’s been 
swell.

Many Thanks 
for Fond 

Memories

I took a lot of photos during my years at the Guardian, but some-times I feel like I don’t deserve the 
wealth of opportunities that working 
for the school newspaper has offered 
me. I might be exaggerating, but a 
photo takes a fraction of a second, after 
all. Yet, I get just as much space in print 
as the many talented writers whose sto-
ries I have had the pleasure of working 
on. I was especially honored a year ago, 
after just three short quarters of taking 
pictures for the Guardian, when they 
decided to give me my own office and 
the wonderful responsibility of being 
in charge of the photo department.

I had been pretty timid when I 
started taking photos for the Guardian, 
barely able to muster the courage to 
approach people after I took their 
photo. Somewhere along the line, 
though, I started getting recognized by 
the higher-profile students on campus. 
I’m talking about the big players on 
the A.S. Council and in the activist 
organizations — people I thought I 
had nothing in common with two 
years ago, but who now tell me they see 
me everywhere. Becoming editor had 

forced me to grow in many ways. The 
most important change is that I began 
to see more of the good in what people 
were doing on campus, even when I 
agreed more with people’s enthusiasm 
than their message. At some point my 
last remnants of apathy dissolved.

Another unexpected opportunity 
that I am hugely thankful for was the 
chance to write for the Guardian. I 
would have to agree with my fellow 
editors that my column chronicling my 
adventures as a photographer should 
have been called “Through My Creepy 
Lens.” I’m sure a lot of the people on 
campus who have seen me working with 
my camera would find that the title fits. 
Anyway, I have to thank our Focus edi-
tor Alyssa for being so positive about my 
articles, even as I regularly turned them 
in late. And thanks to my friends on and 
off the Guardian staff for providing the 
inspiration for my stories.

I think the rest of the Guardian 
would agree that our photography 
continued to excel this year. With my 
associate Erik taking over as photo edi-
tor, I’m sure that even stronger images 
will soon grace the Guardian’s pages.

My Guardian soiree began long before I entered the hallowed halls of our prestigious institution, dating back 
to when I was a pimply faced, mid-pubescent 
teen on the staff of our high school’s news-
paper, the Lowell. Alongside several future 
world leaders, including Sports Editor Rael 
“Themba” Enteen, we commandeered the 
sports page, adding our personalized flair and 
sports-minded nuances to the section as we 
pleased. It was fun, but coming into UCSD, I 
hardly thought about joining the newspaper, 
opting instead to immerse myself solely in my 
studies. It was not until Rael got on the horn 
after the departure of his former associate that 
I mulled over donning the No. 45 and bring-
ing back the team to greatness. After little 
deliberation, I laced up my Jumpmans and 
entered the fray.

I’ve had a great time here and most of my 
memories deal not with the paper but the 
people who make it. Putting together pages, 
writing (albeit rarely) and assigning stories 
were all fine, but I’ve been most drawn to the 
intellect of the staff. It’s great that there are 
smart and funny people who bring something 
to the table and still take care of business. For 
that stimulation I am grateful to you all.

Thank you to fearless leader Charles, for 
your dedication to the cause. You got heart, 
kid. Thank you to McArdle, Mendoza and 
L’Heureux for having answers and accepting 
that I will never understand the difference 
between Focus and Hiatus. Gracias to Richard 
for not punching me in the face after I yell for 
you, and thanks for making my job even easier 
with your Korean technology. To the rest of the 
staff, thank you guys for the entertainment.

Mike, my apologies for arriving late so 
many times for distribution. Anna G, much 
thanks for the new ride and also making sure 
I get that money.

Finally, to the sports crew: thanks forever 
for being on top of your game. You are my 
ideal No. 3 hitter: powerful and consistent. To 
my fellow handsome entrepreneur Enteen: we 
did it mope, and it’s just the beginning.

So here I am, sprinting out for the last 
time to my position and ready to begin the 
proverbial and uncertain “new things” in life 
that retiring athletes discuss at their teary-eyed 
farewells. Am I sad? A little. However, I think 
I’ll listen to my good friend and two-time NBA 
MVP Steve Nash and do what he once told me: 
“Get the fuck out of here, kid!” It’s been grand.

BRINGING THE HEAT, HEROES & HASH TO SUMMER DAZE

SCORCHING THE 

M ike Meyers’ comedic penchant for accents, Maxim cover co-stars and palpable punch lines your 
parents will laugh at define many of his 
films, including summer comedy “The 
Love Guru.” Brandishing a celebrity cast 
of actors/pop-culture polymaths Jessica 
Alba and Justin Timberlake as well as a 
plethora of cameos (another Mike Meyers 
trend) the film will undoubtedly make 
playful jokes about the “Kama Sutra,” 
Ryan Seacrest and anything else you 
would have found mildly witty before 
you saw your first Judd Apatow movie.

But the film’s target audience isn’t 

the ribald post-Chappelle sensibilities 
of the young adult generation (despite 
Meyers’ strategic hosting of the 2008 
MTV awards) as much as it is the whole 
family. Coupled with a highly predict-
able plot that isn’t really even worth 
explaining, let’s just hope you forgot how 
bad the jokes were in “Austin Powers: 
Goldmember” — that way when you 
hear them again in “The Love Guru” 
they won’t seem as blatantly overdone.

F ollowing the massive success of  foreign wonder “Pan’s Labyrinth,” director Guillermo Del Toro’s 
“Hellboy II: The Golden Army” con-
tiues the tale of the self-titled demonic 
doyen, only this time with a bigger budget 
and twice as many Magic-card villains. 
Creatively envisioning a hybrid genre of the 
supernatural adventure and gothic fantasia, 
Del Toro’s imagination catches fire in his 
latest work. Hellboy (Ron Perlman), Liz 
(Selma Blair) and the rest of the mutant 
mystery machine unite to battle an under-
world prince from another realm seeking 
to animate the cataclysmic force of — you 

guessed it — the Golden Army.
Although expectations shouldn’t be too 

high for the film’s cinematic brilliance, 
like many other graphic novel inspirations, 
“Hellboy”’s style should make it enter-
taining enough. In a world blending the  
atmosphere of “Harry Potter,” the para-
normal escapade of “Men in Black” and 
the character/costume design of “Battlestar 
Galactica,” the film’s art direction is sure to 
attract an academy nomination and per-
haps Del Toro’s second win. July 11.

C hris Carter, director of the upcom-ing “X-Files: I Want to Believe,” has gone to extraordinary lengths 
to keep any details about the sequel under 
wraps. The reason? Six years after the Fox 
sci-fi series went off the air for good, its 
massive fanbase is as desperate as ever 
for a sneak peek of what will happen to 
FBI special agents and star-crossed lovers 
Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana 
Scully (Gillian Anderson), enough to crash 
the trailer’s official Web site within minutes 
of it being uploaded.

The film will not dwell on the mytho-
logical arc that fueled the series, although 
Mulder and Scully’s love child that surfaced 
at the end of season seven will be referenced. 
Leaked images of Duchovny and Anderson 
passionately embracing were staged to fool 
the public. (Damn you, Carter. You tease.) 
And with the same director, stars and writ-
ers, everything we loved about the show 
will be back, even if we have to wait until 
the midsummer release date. (Unless the 
hackers get to it first — after all, the truth is 
out there.) July 25.

I n futuristic action-thriller “Babylon A.D.,” Toorop (Vin Diesel) takes on the job of transporting a nun (Michelle Yeoh) from Russia to China; simple enough for Vinny, except for the 
whole bit about a cult chasing after the nun, who is holding a 
genetically modified messiah baby. Granted, with Diesel starring, it 
pretty much leaves his options open between tearing shit up, going 
from zero to 60 in under five seconds or babysitting a ragtag band 
of prepubescent children, so combining all three probably isn’t such 
a stretch for him. While we can pretty much guess what’ll be going 
on for the entire movie (explosions, neon lasers, gratuitous nudity), 
that’s no reason to go in with those low expectations of being blown 
away in the same way a cheap hooker would. August 29.

T he first two “Mummy” movies (and the “Scorpion King” spi-noff), were imaginative, rollicking 
adventures in the tradition of Indiana 
Jones, films that relied on special effects, 
plot twists and comic one-liners to sati-
ate the audience’s desire for moderately 
violent, old-fashioned escapist fare that 
didn’t take itself too seriously. But this 
latest “Mummy” adventure appears to 
take the latter too far, with the trailer fea-
turing such ludicrous and self-referential 
cliches as “Sorry pal, there’s a mummy on 
the loose!” and “Good going dad, you’ve 
raised another mummy!”

The trailer contains several ominous 
warning signs foretelling a potentially cool 
critical reception, namely the absence of 
acclaimed actress Rachel Weisz (replaced 
by Maria Bello), the August release date 
(traditionally an industry dumping 
ground for cinematic mishaps), a new 
director and a shift in setting away from 
the exhausted landscape of Egypt to the 
yet undisturbed mythological trove that 
is China. The film brings in Chinese 
acting heavyweights Michelle Yeoh and 
Jet Li, who appears to be continuing his 
transition to films more palatable to the 
family demographic. Apart from these 
glaring shortcomings there is still hope, 
for as long as the movie crams enough 
special effects, vast CGI armies, colorful 
villains, undead creatures and adequately 
comedic lines into a modestly cohesive 
plot, it will fulfill its sole mission to enter-
tain. August 1.

Step into t h e shoes of 
Fred Simmons (Danny 

McBride), an incompetent 
taekwondo instructor and 

self-proclaimed badass. He runs a 
generic strip-mall dojo in the boonies 

and relishes the power he wields over his 
pupils. Back at home, though, his relation-

ship with his scandalous wife Suzie (Mary Jane 
Bostic) falls apart when she returns from her 
first day at work with Xeroxed titty photos and 
a boss blow-job confession.

Simmons can only find solace in chub-
by apprentice Julio (Spencer Moreno), nerd-
creeper friend Mike McAlister (Jody Hill) and 
personal savior Chuck “The Truck” Wallace 
(Ben Best), a B-movie martial artist with a pen-
chant for coke and anonymous sex. Ultimately, 

Simmons unites his students, defeats his rival 
and emerges wiser and victorious. If you took 
all of the awesome out of “The Karate Kid,” 
replaced Ralph Macchio with a Will Ferrell 
archetype and staged every scene in “Fist” with 
“Napoleon Dynamite”’s deadpan pace, you’d 
begin to understand how unnecessary this 
movie is.

To start, who doesn’t love an inspirational 
montage? Normally they’re set to bumping 
’80s classics that emphasize the protagonist’s 
progress through blood, sweat and tears, but in 
“Fist” they just serve as empty padding to fill out 
the film’s paltry 87 minutes (which feel embar-
rassingly long). About 10 of those minutes are 
hilarious dialogue between Simmons and his 
students, a triumphant break-up with his slutty 
wife (who looks like a porn reject) and a bloody 
fight with “The Truck” after Simmons finds him 
sleeping with his woman. Bostic can’t act her 

way out of a Texas Manhandler, let alone a me-
too indie comedy, and you feel a little dirty and 
ashamed watching her with an audience.

On the other hand, McBride’s portrayal of 
the awkward instructor is both uncomfortable 
and realistic, partly because of his acting chops 
but also because the script is an unusual brand 
of shitty. 

You can see why comedy stalwarts like 
Will Ferrell and Judd Apatow put their seal 
of approval on the film — because McBride’s 
comedic timing and candid style show promise 
— but the choppy dialogue and minimal (read: 
laughable) plot keep the mustached star from 
reaching his full potential. See it if you loved 
“Grandma’s Boy” or “Freddy Got Fingered.”

 TOMB OF THE DRAGON EMPEROR

 ALBUM
S!

  Weezer
  ■ The Red Album
  GEFFEN

W ith an impressive set of indie-revered albums under their collective sweater, you’d think it’d be stupid to question 
whether Weezer’s honest alt-pop sound has 
found a successful niche in the industry. But 
apparently the geeky foursome has used its 
sixth album (self-titled but nicknamed The Red 
Album) as an opportunity to flaunt the group’s 
raw nonconformity and combat past poor-
review-rooted insecurities. Frontman Rivers 
Cuomo uses his self-proclaimed awkwardness as 
an excuse to romp around the album’s 10 tracks 
with loose musical indecision and a defensive 
ego, leaving listeners with a choppy sound and 
an ironic intention that’s trying a little too hard.

After Geffen Records asked Weezer to record 
more commercial songs, the band busted out 
“Pork and Beans” — a catchy, rebellious tune 
paired with eccentric guitar squeaks reminiscent 
of “El Scorcho.” Ultimately, Cuomo decided to 
stay true to his identity (“Imma do the things 
that I wanna do/ I ain’t got a thing to prove to 
you”), but his message is unconvincing — why 
else would he brag about his unconventional diet 
(“I’ll eat my candy with the pork and beans”) but 
to show he’s unique?

More experimental tracks include “The 
Greatest Man that Ever Lived,” an epic journey 
that starts with a sweet, tinkling piano, adds 
cop-car sirens and then samples from an all-
you-can-eat buffet of genres, including churchy 
choir choruses and heavy metal grunts. Cuomo’s 
intentionally egotistical lyrics culminate with 
a cheesy interlude that puffs “If you don’t like 
it/ you can shove it/ But you don’t like it/ You 
love it.” While the song’s dynamic sound keeps 
you curious, its jazzed over-performance only 
impresses in an overrated-amusement-park-
ride sort of way.

Guitarist Brian Bell also steals a track with 
mediocre serenading on “Thought I Knew,” — a 
shallow ditty that feels awkward and misplaced 
against songs traditionally trademarked with 
Cuomo’s melodic voice.

While moments of The Red Album hint at 
the charming and unpretentious Weezer of the 
past, whatever soul-searching these dudes have 
done in their two-year hiatus has left their songs 
weirdly fragmented and empty.

S wedish pop hit, turned internation-ally successful musical, turned feature film “Mamma Mia!” comes to the-
aters this summer, hoping to capitalize on the 
wave of recent song-and-dance blockbusters 
a la “Hairspray” and “Rent.” But unlike its 
Broadway-born peers, “Mamma Mia!” looks 
to be another “Across the Universe”-esque 
mistake — tolerable when the music fits the 
script, but ultimately lame with ridiculous 
plot points written purely to fit a song.

The recipe for mama’s rancid third course? 
Soon-to-be-married Sophie (Amanda 
Seyfried) dreams only of having her father 

walk her down the aisle. Unfortunately, her 
mother (Meryl Streep, if you can believe it) 
was kind of loose, and Sophie’s parentage is 
thus unclear. Add two parts ABBA and shake. 
The result doesn’t look good, but neither did 
the ultra-popular musical, so if your Sweden-
obsessed roommates drag you along, at least 
potential fathers Pierce Brosnan and Colin 
Firth make the visuals a little more appetiz-
ing. July 18.

I n a re-creation of Mel Brooks’ 1965 TV series, Steve Carell plays Maxwell Smart, a secret agent with the IQ of 
Mr. Bean, whose accidental crime-fight-

I n the words of Ray Kinsella, Kevin Costner’s character in “Field of Dreams,” “I have 
just created something totally illog-
ical.”  Yes, you did it in 1989 and 
you’re doing it again, Mr. Costner. 
With “Swing Vote,” Costner plays a 
Billy Bob Thorton-esque schmuck. 
But due to a glitch in the system, 
the result of the nation’s presiden-
tial election comes down to one 
vote: his.

This is kind of like “Welcome 
to Mooseport” on a national level. 
But instead of deciding whether to 
cast your ballot for Gene Hackman 
or Ray Romano, Costner has to 
decide between Democratic nomi-
nee Dennis Hopper and Republican 
incumbent Kelsey Grammer while 
these two and their cronies try to 
win him over.  

Besides the impossibility of this 
situation ever happening, the film-
makers have to end in the least 
controversial way possible without 
resorting to a cornball tie (if they 
did, the collective groan would be 
heard from outer space). Perhaps, 
Costner will just throw his vote out 
the window and pick Nader. Hell, 
considering Hollywood’s supposed 
liberal bias, it’ll probably end with 
a communist coup led by the Steel 
Workers of America. But hey, at 
least it’s nice to think that your vote 
counts for something. August 1.

Just how far can you stretch a franchise? As far as George Lucas — mastermind behind the “Star Wars” movies and their fictional intergalactic realm that dedicated fanboys have been studying 
since the original ’70s trilogy first premiered — wants.

The animated “Star Wars: The Clone Wars,” which tells the story of the 
much-alluded-to battle vaguely responsible for the death of nearly every 
Jedi, hits theaters this August, just in time to get a new generation of Star 
Warriors excited for the upcoming Wii video game and TV show.

Sure it’s absurd, but people just can’t get enough of Yoda and his Force-
wielding colleagues, so get ready for another summer marked by plastic 
lightsaber battles and Slurpee cups shaped like C-3PO. August 15.

N olan’s “The Dark Knight” tops summer hit lists for every crowd: Nerds twitter about the 
sweet cinematic fulfillment of Batman 
lore with Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) 
joining the good Gotham fight with 
its new vigilante Batman (Christian 
Bale) and rising star Lt. James Gordon 
(Gary Oldman); cinema buffs salivate 
over the groundbreaking possibili-
ties (Best opening ever? Highest gross 
ever?); and every “Brokeback” softie 
melts with the thought of seeing Heath 
Ledger on screen one last time.

But don’t expect the Aussie hunk 
extraordinaire. Hollywood buzz tells of 
a Ledger brilliantly on edge and fright-
eningly on point as the Joker, Batman’s 
greatest and most sadistic enemy. The 
character that murdered a comic-book 
Robin is now blamed for the real-life 
Ledger’s death — it adds another chap-
ter to one of the most enduring mythos 
of modern-day literature (yeah, I just 
called comic books literature).

“Knight” starts where “Begins” left 
off. Gotham’s newly crowned orphan-
turned-hero has the crooks running 
from the streets before a murderous 
freak named the Joker unites them to 
(cue Ledger’s creepy quote from the 
trailer) “kill the Batman.” Meanwhile, 
playboy Bruce Wayne beefs up his 
crime-fighting repertoire with bata-
rangs, a new suit and a new Batpod, 
while contemplating partnerships 
between his nighttime alter ego and 
Gotham’s cops and bureaucrats: Dent, 
a district attorney with strong con-
victions for justice, Gordon, Batman’s 
loyal police insider and flame Rachel 
Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal)

Nourishing Batman’s inevitable act-
two brood are returning characters Wayne 
Enterprises CEO Lucius Fox (Morgan 
Freeman) and fatherly butler Alfred 
Pennyworth (Michael Caine). July 18.

I n 1994, an emcee named Nas set a lyrical standard by dropping the most influ-
ential rap album in history. In 
the same year, nine of the best 
underground New York City MCs 
christened themselves a hip-hop 
dynasty called the Wu-Tang Clan, 
and a heavyweight rapper from 
Brooklyn named Biggie Smalls, aka 
the Notorious B.I.G., dominated 
not just hip-hop but all of music. 
In ’94, radio would think twice to 
play rap and most rappers would 
struggle to go gold. Yet regardless of 
this struggle, it was the year when 
music was raw, vigorous and real.

“The Wackness” takes place 
in this golden era of hip-hop. 
Written and directed by Jonathan 
Levine, “The Wackness” is semi-
autobiographical, following teen-
age drug dealer Luke (Josh Peck), 
who trades therapy sessions for 
pot with psychiatrist Dr. Squires 
(Sir Ben Kingsley). Aside from 
being an unabashed tribute to the 
best year in hip-hop, the film is an 
honest look into the lives of two 
emotionally isolated people and 
the steps they take to overcome 

their loneliness.
While many have already lazily 

pegged the film a pothead com-
edy, doing so overlooks everything 
that the film does so well. Though 
marijuana is an important aspect, 
it certainly isn’t the film’s focus. 
Luke’s pot dealing and Dr. Squires’ 
pot smoking are both a means of 
escape and a way for both charac-
ters to confront their immaturity. 
The movie flourishes, creating a 
genuine feel for the characters and 
the culture surrounding them. Like 
hip-hop, marijuana is indicative of 
the culture.

The authenticity of the film 
wouldn’t have been achieved with-
out the convincing performances. 
Newcomer Josh Peck of “Drake & 
Josh” fame delivers a performance 
that not only makes it hard to believe 
Peck is a Nickelodeon alumnus but 
also makes current Hollywood fave 
Shia LaBeouf look like an amateur. 
And while Kingsley’s performance 
as the druggie-psychiatrist is a 
breath of fresh air from his usual 
repertoire of serious roles, at times 
Peck’s performance outshines the 
good knight. Credit also goes to an 

excellent supporting cast, especially 
Olivia Thirlby, who was overlooked 
in last year’s “Juno” but stands out 
as the girl who breaks Luke’s heart. 
And Kingsley’s makeout session 
with Mary-Kate Olsen alone could 
be reason enough to see it.

Backed by excellent direction 
and a dense hip-hop soundtrack 
with everything from Raekwon, A 
Tribe Called Quest and even some 
good ol’ Fresh Prince, the film 
overflows with obvious passion, 
making “The Wackness” all the 
more special.

If there’s anything to criticize, 
it’s that the film goes overboard 
with the ’90s references (throw-
ing out two “Forrest Gump” allu-
sions), and while it’s understand-
able to create relatable characters, 
sometimes even the most honest 
of emotions can seem drawn out. 
Perhaps not as witty as last winter’s 
indie hit “Juno,” “The Wackness” 
still proves in every way to be 
more substantial and, ultimately, 
more authentic. July 3.

THE WACKNESS review
F or loyal fans of “The Office”’s delightfully whacky Dwight Schrute or “Juno”’s “your 
eggo is preggo” drugstore clerk, 
Rainn Wilson’s summer comedy, 
“The Rocker,” is sure to have you burst-
ing with moments of ha-ha. After the 
drummer of his nephew’s band falls ill 
before their high school prom, Robert 
“Fish” Fishman (Rainn Wilson) slips 
into his skin-tight pants and zebra-
print shirt, indulges in massive alco-
hol consumption and relives his 
glamorized fantasies of rock-stardom.  
Despite the film’s hype similar to that 

of Fish’s naked middle-aged drum-
mer YouTube craze, don’t expect 
anything that you haven’t seen 
before — a ridiculously washed-up, 
albeit, sincerely good-hearted “rock 
star” who’s given a second chance at 
fame (a la “School of Rock”).  So if 
you have a few extra dollars and a 
free night to spare, knock yourself 
out; otherwise, the release date at 
Blockbuster shouldn’t seem too far 
away. August 1.

THE ROCKER

S ummer comedy “Tropic Thunder” is another Ben Stiller-led parody, this time 
mocking Hollywood war films. The 
movie-within-a-movie plot sets Stiller 
as the big name who starred in a recent 
flop, Jack Black as the go-to comedian 
and Robert Downey Jr. as the actor 
who has his skin darkened to play a 
black man in the combat flick. But 
things go wrong on location filming 

and the trio ends up in the middle of a 
real-life battle zone. What promises to 
be over-the-top hilarity ensues.

Why is this film a must-see? As if 
Downey Jr. in blackface makeup hadn’t 
piqued your curiosity enough, there’s 
also apparently a cameo from one fat-
and-balding Tom Cruise. August 15.

SUMMER MOVIES cont.

A t this point, with back-to-back summer releases of “Cars” and “Ratatouille,” 
we’ve come to expect a Pixar 
movie. It’s easy to overlook how 
special every Pixar release actu-
ally is: “We’ve spent the last 15 
years just trying to get up to speed 
so that we can get to one movie 
a year,” director and co-writer 
Andrew Stanton remarks, regard-
ing this year’s offering, the sci-fi 
tinged “Wall-E.” Considering it 
takes about four years to craft an 
original Pixar movie, we should 
expect each summer release to be 
a special treat.

“Wall-E” marks the return to 
the director’s chair for Stanton. 
In the now legendary Pixar brain-
storming lunch, the original 
visionaries created several char-
acters that were responsible for 
a number of memorable movies, 
such as “Toy Story,” “Monsters, 
Inc.” and, of course, the criti-
cally acclaimed “Finding Nemo.” 
However, one of the characters 
that has yet to make its silver-
screen debut was Wall-E, a robot 
programmed to collect trash long 
after humans leave Earth.

“What is the point of living? In 
my mind, the point of living is to 
love.” Stanton’s words are reflect-
ed in “Wall-E” — essentially a 
love story, but specifically about 

a robot’s awareness of the abil-
ity to love. Part of what inspired 
Stanton to create “Wall-E” was the 
exploration of the question that if 
a robot was left to repeat the same 
menial task over and over again 
for centuries, would it ever ques-
tion the monotony of its job?

“I love the idea of this machine 
coming to that awareness and see-
ing what came of that,” he said.

While Stanton has used non-
human characters to convey his 
stories, Wall-E is, in essence, the 
fruition of Stanton’s true beliefs 
as a storyteller, since the charac-
ters themselves don’t even really 
speak. Stanton believes “if you 
can orchestrate your story right 
without much dialogue, you can 
really get some powerful respons-
es from your audience.” 

It’s hard not to underplay 
Stanton’s reputation of delivering 
classic animated movies.

“It hasn’t been since ‘Toy Story’ 
that I’ve been this excited about 
the originality of a movie … you 
knew that it was one of a kind,” 
Stanton said. Considering “Toy 
Story” set a standard for animated 
movies, perhaps “Wall-E” may set 
a standard for storytelling in ani-
mated films. June 27.

D reamWorks Pictures’ newest animat-ed epic, “Kung Fu Panda,” is the cul-mination of everything truly great 
about children’s movies. The film tells the 
story of Po (Jack Black), a chubby, kung-fu 
obsessed panda who is chosen as the Dragon 
Warrior and must save his Chinese Valley of 
Peace from Tai Lung, the  snow leopard super 
villain who recently escaped from the maxi-
mum-security prison specifically designed 
to contain him. This is all, of course, much 
to the chagrin of Po’s father, who comes from 
a long lineage of noodle-making geese and 
believes his son should follow suit — “Broth 
runs through our veins!”

Everyone is shocked when Po is bizarre-
ly named the Chosen One by turtle guru 
Master Oogway, including Po’s new instruc-
tor Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) and his elite 
students. But Oogway stands by his decision, 

reminding his apprentice that there are no 
accidents as he disinigrates in an angelic 
cloud of peach blossoms. So Shifu eventually 
embraces Po, realizing that the valley’s only 
hope is this big klutzy bear, and begins teach-
ing him with the only incentive to which Po 
really responds: food. (Cue “Rocky”-esque 
training sequence with dumplings.)
Yes, with a star-studded cast (including 

everyone from action-adventure bombshells 
Angelina Jolie and Lucy Liu to funnymen 
Black and Seth Rogen, and even featuring 
classic kung-fu hero Jackie Chan), humor 
that big kids can appreciate and top-notch 
animation, “Kung Fu Panda” is easily the 
best movie of its genre since 2001’s “Shrek.”

KUNG FU PANDA review

E veryone loves a good poop joke, and Adam Sandler is known by many as the master of the art form. 
We’ve seen him range from classic fare 
like “Happy Gilmore” and “Big Daddy” 
to the abortions that were “Little Nicky” 
and “50 First Dates,” but his use of gratu-
itous slapstick and potty humor has largely 
stayed the same. “You Don’t Mess with 
the Zohan” ups the “Airplane”-esque sight 
gags to an oppressive level, sets Sandler 
and co. within the sensitive confines of the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict and capitalizes 
on every possible chance to deride Middle 
Eastern culture in tastelessly easy ways. 

It’s like that liberal Hollywood circle 
jerk “American Dreamz” from a few years 
back; both films are so incompetent at the 
Chappelle technique of universal discrimi-
nation that they just make the audience 

feel guilty.
Sandler’s Zohan is the ultimate Mossad 

agent, a superhuman force in counterter-
rorism with a bulge that all the Israeli hon-
eys love. Secretly, he dreams of becoming 
a famous hairstylist who will one day use 
his talent to make the whole world “silky 
smooth.” To escape all the fighting and look 
for a better life in New York City, Zohan 
fakes his death at the hands of his Hezbollah 
archrival, the Phantom, played by John 
Turturro. Turturro’s character annoys with 
stilted one-liners and cardboard character-
ization, so if you were expecting the second 
coming of “Lebowski”’s Jesus, prepare for 
disappointment. 

Once in America, Zohan finds 
Palestinians and Israelis coexisting in rela-
tive peace, and even befriends a Palestinian 
hairdresser named Dalia (Emmanuelle 

Chriqui), who employs him at the salon 
and serves as the comedy’s weak love inter-
est. Finally, former-terrorist-turned-cabbie 
Salim (played by polarizing Rob Schneider) 
spots the metrosex Zohan and vows to 
take revenge for that one time in the desert 
when Zohan stole his goat (I’m not mak-
ing this up). The film closes with Israelis 
and Palestinians bonding over their own 
racial stereotypes (hummus, disco dancing, 
bootleg electronics, more hummus) and 
joining forces to defeat the real enemy, an 
American redneck named James (an oddly 
fitting role for Dave Matthews).

Additional cringe-worthy cameos from 
John McEnroe, Chris Rock and Mariah 
Carey come off as forced and studio-calcu-
lated. Having Zohan wear Mariah T-shirts 
for the majority of the film initially seems 
like a harmless character quirk, but actu-

ally turns out to be a grand marketing 
scheme for the diva to instruct the audi-
ence, straight up, to buy her new album.

 Although Sandler penned the script 
with SNL writer Robert Smigel and comedy 
moneyhat Judd Apatow, “Zohan” feels ’90s 
primitive when put up against recent genre 
hits like “Superbad” and “Knocked Up.” It 
offers a few hilarious slow-mo montages 
of geriatric sexual-innuendo-through-hair-
cutting, some “Holy Grail” moments that 
break the fourth wall of absurdity (i.e. using 
eyeglasses as a hummus spoon) and proves 
that Sandler still has a talent for comedic 
timing, but we’ve been watching the same 
movie every year since “Billy Madison” in 
’95. June 6.

W e all remember that classic scene in the first “Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,” adapted from Ann Brashares’ chick fiction: 
four best friends find a mysterious pair of jeans and 
(much to their high-pitched incredulity) discover 
that it fits each of them perfectly. Even the full-bod-
ied Carmen (America Ferrera) is wide-eyed when 
the pants hug her ample curves. The rollercoaster 
antics surrounding this magical thrift find were an 
instant hit with 2005 audiences — and hey, if the 
pants fit, Hollywood makes a sequel.

This summer’s “Sisterhood” promises to catch 
up on the now college-bound girls, who rediscover 
themselves all over again — complete with the 
original lovelorn adventures and tearful dramat-
ics. This includes that hot, blonde soccer chick 
Bridget (Blake Lively), hopefully starring in anoth-
er sweaty running-on-the-beach scene. And aren’t 
we all thirsty to find out how cynical Tibby (Amber 
Tamblyn) will deal with little Bailey’s (Jenna Boyd) 
death? This is a movie to see with the moms — and 
don’t forget your tissues, sister.  August 6.

I n 1994, an emcee named Nas set a lyrical standard by dropping the most influ-
ential rap album in history. In 
the same year, nine of the best 
underground New York City MCs 
christened themselves a hip-hop 
dynasty called the Wu-Tang Clan, 
and a heavyweight rapper from 
Brooklyn named Biggie Smalls, aka 
the Notorious B.I.G., dominated 
not just hip-hop but all of music. 
In ’94, radio would think twice to 
play rap and most rappers would 
struggle to go gold. Yet regardless of 
this struggle, it was the year when 
music was raw, vigorous and real.

“The Wackness” takes place 
in this golden era of hip-hop. 
Written and directed by Jonathan 
Levine, “The Wackness” is semi-
autobiographical, following teen-
age drug dealer Luke (Josh Peck), 
who trades therapy sessions for 
pot with psychiatrist Dr. Squires 
(Sir Ben Kingsley). Aside from 
being an unabashed tribute to the 
best year in hip-hop, the film is an 
honest look into the lives of two 
emotionally isolated people and 
the steps they take to overcome 

their loneliness.
While many have already lazily 

pegged the film a pothead com-
edy, doing so overlooks everything 
that the film does so well. Though 
marijuana is an important aspect, 
it certainly isn’t the film’s focus. 
Luke’s pot dealing and Dr. Squires’ 
pot smoking are both a means of 
escape and a way for both charac-
ters to confront their immaturity. 
The movie flourishes, creating a 
genuine feel for the characters and 
the culture surrounding them. Like 
hip-hop, marijuana is indicative of 
the culture.

The authenticity of the film 
wouldn’t have been achieved with-
out the convincing performances. 
Newcomer Josh Peck of “Drake & 
Josh” fame delivers a performance 
that not only makes it hard to believe 
Peck is a Nickelodeon alumnus but 
also makes current Hollywood fave 
Shia LaBeouf look like an amateur. 
And while Kingsley’s performance 
as the druggie-psychiatrist is a 
breath of fresh air from his usual 
repertoire of serious roles, at times 
Peck’s performance outshines the 
good knight. Credit also goes to an 

excellent supporting cast, especially 
Olivia Thirlby, who was overlooked 
in last year’s “Juno” but stands out 
as the girl who breaks Luke’s heart. 
And Kingsley’s makeout session 
with Mary-Kate Olsen alone could 
be reason enough to see it.

Backed by excellent direction 
and a dense hip-hop soundtrack 
with everything from Raekwon, A 
Tribe Called Quest and even some 
good ol’ Fresh Prince, the film 
overflows with obvious passion, 
making “The Wackness” all the 
more special.

If there’s anything to criticize, 
it’s that the film goes overboard 
with the ’90s references (throw-
ing out two “Forrest Gump” allu-
sions), and while it’s understand-
able to create relatable characters, 
sometimes even the most honest 
of emotions can seem drawn out. 
Perhaps not as witty as last winter’s 
indie hit “Juno,” “The Wackness” 
still proves in every way to be 
more substantial and, ultimately, 
more authentic. July 3.

Staff Writer

THE WACKNESS review
F or loyal fans of “The Office”’s delightfully whacky Dwight Schrute or “Juno”’s “your 
eggo is preggo” drugstore clerk, 
Rainn Wilson’s summer comedy, 
“The Rocker,” is sure to have you burst-
ing with moments of ha-ha. After the 
drummer of his nephew’s band falls ill 
before their high school prom, Robert 
“Fish” Fishman (Rainn Wilson) slips 
into his skin-tight pants and zebra-
print shirt, indulges in massive alco-
hol consumption and relives his 
glamorized fantasies of rock-stardom.  
Despite the film’s hype similar to that 

of Fish’s naked middle-aged drum-
mer YouTube craze, don’t expect 
anything that you haven’t seen 
before — a ridiculously washed-up, 
albeit, sincerely good-hearted “rock 
star” who’s given a second chance at 
fame (a la “School of Rock”).  So if 
you have a few extra dollars and a 
free night to spare, knock yourself 
out; otherwise, the release date at 
Blockbuster shouldn’t seem too far 
away. August 1.

ally turns out to be a grand marketing 
scheme for the diva to instruct the audi-
ence, straight up, to buy her new album.

 Although Sandler penned the script 
with SNL writer Robert Smigel and comedy 
moneyhat Judd Apatow, “Zohan” feels ’90s 
primitive when put up against recent genre 
hits like “Superbad” and “Knocked Up.” It 
offers a few hilarious slow-mo montages 
of geriatric sexual-innuendo-through-hair-
cutting, some “Holy Grail” moments that 
break the fourth wall of absurdity (i.e. using 
eyeglasses as a hummus spoon) and proves 
that Sandler still has a talent for comedic 
timing, but we’ve been watching the same 
movie every year since “Billy Madison” in 
’95. June 6.

W e all remember that classic scene in the first “Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,” adapted from Ann Brashares’ chick fiction: 
four best friends find a mysterious pair of jeans and 
(much to their high-pitched incredulity) discover 
that it fits each of them perfectly. Even the full-bod-
ied Carmen (America Ferrera) is wide-eyed when 
the pants hug her ample curves. The rollercoaster 
antics surrounding this magical thrift find were an 
instant hit with 2005 audiences — and hey, if the 
pants fit, Hollywood makes a sequel.

This summer’s “Sisterhood” promises to catch 
up on the now college-bound girls, who rediscover 
themselves all over again — complete with the 
original lovelorn adventures and tearful dramat-
ics. This includes that hot, blonde soccer chick 
Bridget (Blake Lively), hopefully starring in anoth-
er sweaty running-on-the-beach scene. And aren’t 
we all thirsty to find out how cynical Tibby (Amber 
Tamblyn) will deal with little Bailey’s (Jenna Boyd) 
death? This is a movie to see with the moms — and 
don’t forget your tissues, sister.  August 6.

“Everyone is always willing to make 
time for me to come in and get treat-
ment,” Zatarain said. “I sprained my 
ankle in October, which was during 
season, and the athletic trainers helped 
me get back on the field in a week, and 
even though it’s still bothering me now, 
they are using great rehab programs to 
help me.”

With the hiring of Yang, the sports 
medicine staff now stands at three full-
time trainers in Messey, Yang and Tosh 
Tepraseuth, and two part-time trainers, 
Doug Bauman and Brittany Bingham. 

“I handle a lot of the administration 
work and adding staff helps me to work 
with others on insurance coverage, risk 
management, reduction of liability and 
scheduling staff to comply with NCAA 
and division rules,” Messey said. “They 
are all very essential to the success of the 
sports medicine team and the intercol-
legiate athletic department.”

As the effects of the athletics fee 
referendum become more apparent, 
Messey hopes that his staff will continue 
to grow. The Triton sports program 
has reached new heights during the 
2007-08 season with teams producing 
All-Americans and national rankings. 
Messey and his staff do not claim credit 
for these athletic achievements, but 
deserve ample respect and recognition 
for their role in helping win champion-
ships, one that has been made easier by 
last year’s athletics fee referendum.

possibly tiring them out. The Celtics 
should’ve entered as the favorite, but 
they’ve struggled far more and played 
six more playoff games than the Lakers. 
The Lakers, meanwhile, have surpassed 
expectations during each series so far. 
The Nuggets were never close, Utah’s 
series took a game longer than it should 
have and the Spurs made as weak of a 
defending champion exit since, well, the 
Miami Heat last season. In the book of 
“what have you done for me lately,” the 
Lakers are entering this series heating 
up like Weezer’s newest album, while 
the Celtics seem primed for a “Make 
Believe”-level disappointment.

Yet, before making the pick, it’s 
worth going back to Staples Center 
on December 30, 2007.  I had a flash 
of a Celtics championship victory. I 
saw Garnett hunched over crying, 
Paul Pierce jumping up right in front 
of Tommy Heinsohn and pointing to 
the Boston fans, and Brian Scalabrine 
being all gingery and awkward. In this 
moment, all I had left in the face of 
intense mockery was one, final, inargu-
able comment. And so, as the trans-
planted Bostonians took a slight pause 
from their shenanigans, I turned to the 
fans around me and said, “Yeah, but 
your head coach is still Doc Rivers.” The 
response was silence. Nods of agree-
ment. Resignation to fate. Awesome.

The Celtics dominated that game, 
and the fact they get a break before the 
finals and play the first two and last 
two games at home means that they 
will have a good chance of beating the 
Lakers. And yet, maybe it is that gap 
between Phil Jackson and Doc Rivers 
that proves large enough that no amount 
of fake Irish people can overcome it. 
Like the Brown-for-Gasol trade, the Big 
Ticket and Jesus Shuttlesworth coming 
to Boston, or one well-timed insult, 
sometimes things just fall into place.

HOT CORNER

THURSDAY, JUNE 5, 2008

By Jake Blanc
Senior Staff Writer

Upon first walking into the UCSD 
sports medicine department, the crowd-
ed training room filled with rehabilitat-
ing athletes does not seem to be any 
more productive than it was a year ago 
before the athletics fee referendum was 
passed. The room is still jam-packed 
with a small handful of athletic trainers 
helping players representing UCSD’s 23 
varsity sports teams. On this particular 
day, a baseball player scuttles across 
the room pushing a stool with his foot 
as part of a lower-body rehab workout 
while a water polo player lies on on a 
training table getting her knee exam-
ined. 

With so many athletes seeking treat-
ment in a relatively confined space, 
it would appear that the athletics fee 
referendum money did not boost the 
athletic training department. Nothing 
could be further from the truth. The 
fact that so many athletes are in the 
training room every day speaks vol-
umes to the increased productivity that 
the referendum money has allowed 
the department. So many athletes have 
entered the bottom level of RIMAC 
Arena for medical treatment this year 
mostly because the referendum has 
allowed the department to hire a new 
athletic trainer.

After the referendum passed last 
year, head athletics trainer Kevin 
Messey’s department was given enough 
money to bring on one new staff mem-
ber. In July, Messey and his department 
hired Vanessa Yang to be their new 
certified athletic trainer and she started 
up with the current staff in August just 
as many sports teams were kicking off 
their fall seasons. Yang’s presence was 
felt immediately in the department. 

“It has been tremendous,” Messey 

said. “We have been able to handle a 
lot more athletes and we’ve been able to 
treat more people and do more hands-
on training.”

According to Messey, having one 
more certified athletic trainer has 
boosted the number of athletes that 
his staff can treat while allowing each 
athlete to get more personal treatment. 
The department’s increased productiv-
ity is evident in a comparison of the 
number of athletes treated before and 
after the referendum. This past October, 
traditionally one of the year’s busiest 
months, Messey and his staff were able 
to treat 1,320 athletes, compared to only 
950 in October 2006. 

“[Before the referendum, we had] 
been overworked and unable to handle 
as many athletes,” Messey said. “In the 
past an athlete would come in to do 
a treatment or to get healthy and we 
would be swamped and wouldn’t have 
time to treat them. What we’re doing is 
getting closer to the athletes and giving 
them the attention that they need to get 
healthy and perform out on the field.”

The sports medicine department 
aims not only to help Triton athletes’ 
futures, but also to get injured players 
back in action as quickly as possible. 

“There’s a direct correlation 
[between what we do and the success 
of the teams],” Messey said. “If your star 

basketball player is hurt and I have time 
to call the doctor and get them their X-
rays and get them cleared to play in less 
than five days, then ultimately we have 
our star player back on the court, which 
ultimately gets us a significant chance to 
win again. And that happens every day: 
we evaluate injuries every day and we 
return people to play every day.”

Sophomore Alexia Zatarain, a mid-
fielder for the UCSD women’s soccer 
team, has had injuries both before and 
after the passing of the referendum and 
has noticed the increased productivity 
of the athletic training department.

Senior Rower Leaves Legacy of  Optimism
By Brianna Lee
Staff Writer

She’s known as the smiley one, the optimist and the goal-setter. For UCSD women’s crew, Jennifer 
Myers has proved to be a valuable ath-
lete and leader as the Tritons return 
from their fourth consecutive NCAA 
Championship trip with two silver 
plaques as National Runners-Up. As she 
is set for graduation next week, Myers 
looks back now on how the team’s visit 
to nationals has provided her with some 
of the best ways to remember her 2007-
08 season at UCSD. For Myers, that 
memory is made more special when 
she considers the Tritons’ hard work 
and ability to overcome some of the 
disappointment they experienced early 
in the season.
        “Everything was so amazing,” Myers 
said about the national championship. 
“It really was the best way to end my 
time here. It had been a long season for 
us and it got off to a pretty slow start, 
but nationals was an affirmation of all 
our hard work and the trust that we all 
have in each other.”   

This season brought numerous hon-
ors to Myers as she joined the Western 
Intercollegiate Rowing Association’s 
First Team and picked up three med-
als — gold, silver and bronze — for 
her stellar racing at the Pacific Coast 
Rowing Championships. Soon after, 
Myers received additional recognition 
as she was named to the Division-II 
Pocock All American Team just before 
learning the team would be making a 
returning trip to nationals to compete 
for the title from May 30 to June 1. 

Growing up in a small, ski-resort 
town in California, Myers credits the 
environment around Mammoth Lakes 
for fostering her athleticism as she 
took up mountain biking, swimming 

and hiking during her summers and 
skiing in the winters. In high school 
she became a U.S. Ski and Snowboard 
Association Junior Olympian. With 
such a sport-oriented background, it is 
a wonder as to how Myers chose crew. 

“Actually, I didn’t know I would pur-
sue crew,” she said.  “My freshman year 
I came down here and I wasn’t really 
looking at sports. Sophomore year I 
decided, ‘Okay, I’ve got to get on a team.’ 
I went to talk to [head coach Pattie 
Pinkerton] and she just totally con-
vinced me. She said, ‘If you’re looking 
to be part of a team, this is the sport for 
you because there’s no other sport that is 
so team-oriented.’” 

That same year, Myers’ talent and 
atheticism became apparent as she cap-
tained the novice team and was named 
“most inspirational member.” Myers 
also found herself ranked first on the 
charts for UCSD’s All-Time Novice 
5000-meter and 2000-meter records.

“It’s kind of a mindset that I have,” 
she said. “It’s not like you go into them 
expecting to break records but you’ve 
got to aim for it; otherwise, it’s never 
going to happen. I try to make every 
day an improvement. Any time we go 
out on the water or any time we get on 
the [Ergometer], I do have that mindset 
that I need to be strong for my team-
mates and that I do need to make the 
most of my time.”

According to Pinkerton, Myer’s suc-
cess is not only a result of her ath-
leticism but also her outstanding work 
ethic, something the team will greatly 
miss next year. 

“I’ll miss her smile and her willing-
ness to get out there,” Pinkerton said. 
“Her whole joyous approach to training. 
I could say that about all the seniors 
really, they’ve been wonderful, but with 
Jen I think that it’s her whole approach 
to training. She’s really raised the bar 

for the athletes in general because every 
time she goes out there and sets a new 
record. So in that sense, she will still be 
contributing after she’s gone.” 

According to her senior co-captain 
partner, Kali Webb, Myers has been 
invaluable to the crew’s morale. 

“Jen is the smiley one; the one who 
is always in a good mood,” she said. 
“We’ve complemented each other real-
ly well as far as our personalities go. 
It’s been really nice to work with her 
because she’s fun loving and optimistic.  
She never loses faith even when things 
look unlikely or difficult because she 
tells us, ‘We’ll get through this and well 
make it.’ I think that’s the greatest way 
she’s helped me and the rest of the girls 
on this team.”

For the rowers, Myers’ presence has 
been welcoming and inspirational. 

“What I admire most about Jen 
is her ability to make everybody feel 
accepted and important,” said freshman 
Kristen Hayashi of the varsity-four boat. 
“The amount of trust and faith she has 
in our team, and the way she believes 
that we can do better in every single 
race is incredible.” 

After three years on the team and 
earning honor after honor, Myers’ 
duties as co-captain and racing seasons 
rich with athletic prowess have finally 
come to a close. Although the 2008 sea-
son may conclude her legacy at UCSD, 
her time as a rower will endure. 

“Definitely just recreationally I’ll get 
out there because I love it,” she said. 
“Being on the water is something I 
really enjoy.” 

In fact, Myers’ love for sports and 
her empathy for fellow athletes, is some-
thing that will aide her in the future as 
an aspiring physical therapist. 

“I injured myself in high school, so I 
spent some time in physical therapy and 
just really enjoyed how much patient-

practitioner interaction there was,” 
Myers said.  “That was really cool to 
me. Just being an athlete and loving 
to be active, I want to work with other 
athletes. I want to help them get back 
to the sports they love and get back to 
their teams.”    

Myers says that she has an appre-
ciation for the amount of work ath-
letes put into their sports as well as 
an affinity for being immersed in 
UCSD’s athletic department. With 
her lasting contributions to women’s 
crew and connections to her team-
mates, there is excellent reason to 
think that Myers will merge her supe-
rior athleticism with her ambition for 
helping others.

Sometimes things just fall into place. It doesn’t happen often, but sometimes there is a force in the 
universe, a cosmic tilt, and what was 
once fantasy becomes reality. For the 
NBA, the Los Angeles Lakers meeting 
the Boston Celtics in the finals is just 
that: the biggest rivalry in league his-
tory, reborn on the biggest stage. 

The Lakers proved that Los Angeles 
could be “where amazing happens” even 
without Bynum. They also showed that 
when injuries hit and Gasol was out of 
the lineup, they could be where above 
average happens to stay in the mix 
atop the Western Conference standings. 
Focus was also taken away from Lamar 
Odom, who, despite his versatility, was 
never comfortable being the second-
most important player on the team.

The Lakers’ strength further lies in 
this season’s newfound depth, second-
unit energy, and the trust that Kobe 

Bryant has come to develop in the play-
ers surrounding him. Ronny Turiaf, 
Jordan Farmar and the self-proclaimed 
“Machine” Sasha Vujacic bring a differ-
ent feel when they enter the game, and, 
even without the League MVP on the 
court, are often able to maintain and 
sometimes extend a Lakers lead. Kobe, 
for his part, has taken his game to a 
new level. He hasn’t improved what was 
already the league’s greatest offense, and 
he’s probably made more total clutch 
shots in past years. However, the area 
where he jumped was in leadership. A 
lot of credit also goes to Derek Fisher, 
who grew into that sort of leader long 
ago and returned to the Lakers as a 
calming and familiar presence.

The Celtics are defined by the 
Boston Three Party of Kevin Garnett, 
Paul Pierce and Ray Allen. As much as 
other players, such as Rajon Rondo and 
Kendrick Perkins, have shown flashes of 
great play this season, the Celtics’ rebirth 
is mostly a result of Garnett’s arrival. 
Always a strong defensive player with 
the ability to play anywhere, Garnett 
transformed the team. Furthermore, 
with Allen’s arrival preceding Garnett’s, 
the Big Ticket’s greatest weakness — 
lack of asserting himself in the final 
moments — was offset by one of Allen, 
and Pierce’s, strengths. The fact that the 
team boasted three consistent scorers 
meant that if they could all find a strong 
rhythm defensively, there would be 
enough easy shots to feed each player. 

The addition of a versatile player like 
James Posey — also a young, fast point-
guard who was a constant threat to steal 
the ball — further helped complement 
the solid Celtic core. Indeed, once it was 
proven that the new Celtics would not 
replicate the same chemistry issues as 
the Shaq-Kobe-Malone-Payton Lakers, 
the team seemed a legitimate threat to 
win 70 games. As good as the Celtics 
stars are, Kobe is a tougher matchup 
for any Celtic than even Garnett will 
be for the Lakers. The Lakers have 
enough effective ball handlers to keep 
the Celtics defense constantly mov-
ing and, depending on how deep Doc 
Rivers dips into the Celtics bench,
