DIVISION I 
REFERENDUM 

FAILS
Nearly 60 percent of students voted “no” on the 
historic referendum that would have increased 

student fees to move UCSD to 
Division I athletics. 

By angela chen • Editor in Chief

SPECIAL ELECTION

Undergraduates will not pay a $495 annual increase to move UCSD athletics to Division I. In an unprecedented turn of events, over 
half the undergraduate population voted on the D-I 
referendum during the two-week special election, fail-
ing the increase by approximately 2,000 votes.

If passed, the referendum would have been the first 
step for UCSD to advance from the D-II California 
College Athletic Association Conference —  where it 
has been since 2000 —  to the D-I Big West confer-
ence, which includes fellow UC schools such as Santa 
Barbara, Davis and Irvine.

 Students would have paid the fee increase only if 
the Big West conference accepted UCSD by 2014. The 
Big West rejected UCSD in December 2010.

“It’s a disappointing result because it feels like the 
people I represent as an athlete don’t appreciate or 
respect what I do,” senior track captain Nick Howe 
said. “It’s not just fun and games. We go out there and 
it’s hard work, and we’re representing UCSD. Even 
though we’ve had success, my successors would be so 
much greater if UCSD was a D-I program.” [Ed. note: 
Howe is the Guardian’s Associate Sports Editor.]

According to the A.S. Advocate General Courtney 
Hill, 11, 407 undergraduates (51 percent) voted, with 
6470 “no” votes (approximately 60 percent) to 4673 
“yes” votes (approximately 40 percent). Of the six col-
leges, Warren College had the highest voter turnout. 
Hill said that the 51-percent turnout is the highest in 
school history, especially as election turnout usually 
hovers around 20 percent.

A federal judge has rejected a motion to dismiss a disability lawsuit 
filed by a UC Santa Barbara senior.

On Feb. 27, U.S. District Judge Philip Gutierrez denied a motion to 
throw out Alexander Stern vs. University of California because the defen-
dants, the UC Regents and other individuals, did not meet with plaintiff 
Alexander Stern before filing a motion to dismiss, as is required.

Stern filed a lawsuit against the University of California in October 2011

The Black Student Union may 
move to a new black resource 
center. Currently, the BSU shares 
resource space with the MEChA, or 
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de 
Aztlan.

BSU Chair Allyssa Villanueva 
and BSU Vice Chair Olamide Noah 
presented their proposal —  com-
piled after two years of research 
—  at the Campus Climate Council 
on March 8. The CCC meeting is 
held on the second Thursday of 

every month. The BSU is asking for 
a fully operational, professionally 
staffed resource center that could 
be located in areas such as the Old 
Student Center. This request was 
part of the 19 demands originally 
issued by the BSU in March 2010, 
all of which Chancellor Marye Anne 
Fox approved. 

“Sharing spaces reproduces 
the invisibility and hyper-visibili-
ty of black students on campus,” 
Villanueva said.   “A lot of first-year 
students feel that going into shared 
spaces like the Cross-Cultural cen-
ter is not enough — there’s still no 

black students in the space, no black 
faculty.”

According to Noah, most of 
the other UC schools — including 
UC Santa Cruz, UC Berkeley, UC 
Berkeley and UC Riverside —  have 
black resource centers. Currently, 
black and African students number 
418 undergraduates out of 22,162, 
or 1.8 percent. 

This is the lowest number in the 
UC system, Noah said. Black and 
African students currently comprise 
3 percent of the UC system in total.

because he was denied 
a job due to disability. 
Stern is involved in 
the Disabled Students 
Program, which 
according to its web-
site, exists “to ensure 
that equal access is 
provided to all dis-
abled students.” 

The suit alleges that 
certain jobs, such as 
test proctor, are inac-
cessible to students 
with disabilities at 
UCSB simply due to 
their disabled status.

In their motion 
to dismiss, the UC 
Regents claimed that 
disabled students may 
not be able to perform 
job-related duties and 
that the university should be able to 
reserve the right to deny employment 
to these students.

Gutierrez’s ruling notes that the 
defendants failed to contact Stern 

with adequate time before the dead-
line to discuss the motion to dismiss. 

The defendants 
had 21 days to file 
the motion after 
being served with 
the lawsuit, but are 
required to give five 
days’ notice before 
doing so.

“Under Local 
Rule 7-3, defen-
dants were required 
to meet and con-
fer with plaintiff to 
thoroughly discuss 
the substance of the 
motion to dismiss,” 
Gutierrez wrote in 
his ruling. “For a 
motion to dismiss, 
the meet and con-
fer shall take place 
at least five days 
prior to the last day 

for filing the motion.’”
Stern said that Gutierrez was right 

to deny the motion to dismiss the 
suit.

“This is a very important day for 

equal rights,” Stern wrote in an email. 
“The UC refused to follow the court’s 
rules. Accordingly, the court denied 
the UC’s motion.”

The Daily Nexus reported 
on March 2 that, before filing the 
motion to dismiss, the UC Regents 
had first tried to eliminate Title II 
of the Americans with Disabilities 
Act, which forbids public schools and 
businesses from denying employ-
ment due to disability. 

When the initial motion was 
rejected, the Regents filed a motion 
to dismiss the lawsuit.

Stern said that he looks forward 
to the UC Regents’ response to the 
allegations. The response is due next 
week.

“This case has the potential to 
dramatically affect the lives of stu-
dents with disabilities,” Stern stated 
in an email. “In this economy, it is 
hard enough for anyone to find a job. 
The university should not intention-
ally create an unequal playing field by 
banning the disabled.”

contentious issue for both sides. A 
leaked emailed from an athlete 
urging A.S. Council not to pub-
licize the vote because “we want 
people to vote, but we only want 
them to vote ‘yes,’” cast doubts on 
the neutrality of the campaign, as 
did an all-campus pro-referendum 
email sent by former A.S. President 
Utsav Gupta. 

The campus Judicial Board 
ruled on grievances  — filed by 
both the pro and con campaign — 
based on allegations such as mis-
leading information and inappro-
priate lobbying. J-Board dismissed 
both grievances.

A.S. President Alyssa Wing, 
who ran last year on a slate cen-
tered around D-I athletics, said the 
two-week voting period is partly 
responsible for the higher turnout. 
The voting period is usually one 
week. 

Wing added that although she 
was personally disappointed with 
the results, she was happy that the 
student body had the opportunity 

to weigh in on the issue.
“The two-week voting period 

really helped students mobilize on 
both sides,” she said. “The percent-
age of students that showed up was 
very representative of what students 
actually wanted. I am genuinely 
very happy that the democratic 
process occurred and students were 
able to vote in this historic cam-
paign.”

Vice President of Student Life 
Meredith Madnick praised Wing’s 
efforts and the turnout.

“Alyssa did an amazing job, 
and even though this is not what 
we hoped for, the turnout was 
great and it was a historic event,” 
Madnick said. 

Con campaign leader John 
Condello said that A.S. Council 
should never have allowed the D-I 
referendum to go to a student vote. 

“Even though [the con cam-
paign is] happy we won, we’re dis-
appointed that A.S. passed it [to be 
put on the ballot] in the first place,” 
Condello said. “I don’t think it’s via-
ble to bring back in the near future.”

Con campaign leader Kevin 

Quirolo said that he was surprised 
by the turnout and results, and 
that the special election is a warm-
up for the general election next 
quarter. 

“I wouldn’t be against having the 
referendum again [next year], as 
long as there is adequate time to 
have substantial an educational or 
informational period before election 
starts,” Quirolo said. “It’s the respon-
sible way to make a decision.”

Campaigning for the gener-
al elections for the 2012-13 A.S. 
Council has already begun, but 
Wing said that she does not believe a 
D-I referendum will reappear soon.

“This [vote] is a pretty defini-
tive answer, and an accurate gauge 
of feedback,” Wing said. “I don’t 
know what next year’s council will 
do because it hasn’t been settled and 
the people haven’t been voted in, but 
I don’t see this coming up again in 
a year.”

The presentation stated that the 
resource center would cost approx-
imately $306,924. Noah said that 
the resource center would be an 
important aid in recruiting and 
retaining more black students. For 
example, a BSU overnight retention 
program had a 71-percent yield rate; 
21 out of 29 students participating 
eventually decided to attend UCSD.

“If we could maintain this yield 
rate while expanding the program, 
we could make huge strides toward 
reducing this invisibility,” Noah said.

Although Fox pledged her con-
tinued support at the meeting, 
members of the public called for 
more accountability from admin-
istrators.

 “What happened two years ago 
was that no administrator took own-
ership of the proposals, and some of 
us were caught trying to make up 
the slack,” literature professor Jorge 
Mariscal said. “Somebody with seri-
ous credibility needs to take control 
of this so it gets implemented in a 
timely fashion so we’re not here a 
year or two from now with nothing 
done. This is long overdue at this 

campus. We can’t wait another 50 
or 25 years.”

Sociology professor Ivan Evans 
offered to work with Villanueva, 
Noah and other students involved 
to help them receive course credit 
for the work they put into compiling 
the report. 

Members of the CCC called for 
the committee to memorialize, in 
writing, the commitment toward 
providing the new space. The 
motion passed.

Role Reversal

PHOTO ILLUSTRATION BY CHRISTIE YI/GUARDIAN

The morning after the Sun God Festival two years ago, a friend of mine and I drove 
to the ridiculous tradition that is the 
Guardian-Koala sloshball game. Her 
cheeks still smudged with gold body 
paint, and her throat still raw from 
heckling Drake, she told me in a 
coarse whisper that she was beginning 
to feel nostalgic. 

In the wreckage of a dozen stray 
feathers and at least three cans of Four 
Loko, she came to a somber realiza-
tion that morning. Graduation was 
just a few weeks off, and the day prior 
— she began to understand — was 
really the last hurrah. There would 
be no more spray painting of second-
hand T-shirts; no resourceful mixing 
of off-brand alcohol in discarded 
water jugs. Sun God was over, and 
the unique kind of merry, don’t-give-
a-fuck collegiate revelry it represents 
was, too. I didn’t really understand 
her then. I was halfway through col-
lege. I had at least a few secondhand 
T-shirts and water cooler jugs before 
me. Understanding her revelation in a 
detached, sympathetic kind of way, I 
nodded, and told her to come back for 
the festival next year. Her wristband 
would be waiting. 

Another friend of mine, a year 
after graduation told me what she 
missed was just walking around 
campus. Running into people she 
knew. Dodging the myriad crusaders 
for baby seals and Korean BBQ on 
Library Walk. Passing a whole after-
noon in a way that you can’t when 
you’re working 9 to 5. 

It goes without saying that gradu-
ation doesn’t connote what it used 
to. We’ve been reminded a thousand 
times by now that we’re not leaving 
college for cushy careers, suburban 
mortgages or, thank God, marriage. 
We stay young a little longer. But 
based on the experiences of those a 
couple of years ahead of me, I also 
don’t think it’s quite as bad out there 
as it’s been made out to be. Colorful 
tales abound of Princeton grads using 
their International Studies degrees for 
nothing but learning Japanese coffee-
brewing techniques; of Dartmouth co-
eds reciting “would you like fries with 
that?” in Spanish. Until I really need 
to master the conditional tense myself, 
I’m still unconvinced. 

The advice I wish I’d taken more 
seriously these last two years, though, 
and which I think most of us could 
use at UCSD, is to shirk a little more 
responsibility. To show up to class on 
three hours’ sleep. To be less account-
able. You’re saddled down by a few 
obligations while you’re here, sure, 
but ultimately it isn’t nearly so much 
as what awaits. So really: Why not sip 
the Popov-spiked Kool-Aid? 

Experimenting doesn’t take the 
same form for everybody. You’re not 
obligated to suffer through a vegan 
phase, or pre-game the Friday-night 
water polo game with a water bottle of 
raspberry Smirnoff. You don’t need to 
play beer pong. But while I’m trying 
out new Crockpot recipes and catch-
ing up with “The View,” do appreciate 
the fleetingness of the opportunity. It 
doesn’t last as long as you expect.

A Case of  
Recklessness: 
Don’t Make 
Me Graduate

In a popular new teaching model, the students teach themselves. In these “flipped classrooms,” actual instruction takes place 
outside of class: the teacher instructs through 
online videos or video podcasts. Class time is 
reserved for discussion, one-on-one tutoring and 
most importantly, group completion of what is 
traditionally assigned as homework. The flipped 
classroom may currently be an imperfect solution 
for UCSD, but its potential to save money and 
better train students for the professional workforce 
means we owe it serious consideration as an 
option for our cash-strapped, pre-professional 
university. 

Lately, these classrooms have been getting a 
lot of attention. Stanford University announced 
last Monday that it would introduce five online 
classes based on the model this month. And a 
few weeks before that, the Chronicle of Higher 
Education ran a full profile of one of the foremost 
advocates of the “flipped” method — Andrew 
Martin, a professor of biology at the University 
of Colorado at Boulder.  Given the university’s 
ongoing budget crisis, the flipped classroom’s 
economical use of few teaching assistants makes 

it an appealing option.  In a flipped classroom, 
students review material and solve problems in 
groups, largely teaching each other while the 
professor walks around the room answering 
questions. This means that classes that currently 
rely on discussion sections would require far fewer 
TAs under the flipped scheme. Take Revelle’s 
Humanities series and ERC’s Making of the 
Modern World, for instance. Considering that 
these two sequences employ over sixty teaching 
assistants between them per quarter, the potential 
for savings is enormous: a quick deferred wage 
calculation reveals that replacing the TAs with less 
costly essay readers would save about a hundred 
thousand dollars per quarter per course. 

Flipped classrooms prepare students better for 
the workplace by training them to communicate 
and work with each other effectively. As the 
report from a 2007 University of Pittsburgh 
recruiter survey put it: “good communication, 
as well as an ability to work with others are the 
main factors contributing to job success.” All of 
these professional skills are mirrored in flipped 
classrooms. To better prepare UCSD students for 
the workplace, teamwork should be brought into 

the lecture halls. As a university whose students 
are overwhelmingly interested in entering the 
workforce or applying to graduate school, the 
university should adopt flipped classrooms to give 
its students a leg up. 

Furthermore, case studies of LdL (“Lernen 
durch Lehren,” German for “Learning by 
Teaching”), a German teaching method in which 
students lecture, drill and tutor each other, 
point to another benefit offered by the flipped 
classroom.  According to Joachim Grzega, a 
prominent LdL researcher, teachers employing 
learning-by-teaching methods consistently 
observe both faster learning times and higher 
retention rates in their students. His findings 
illustrate we already know intuitively to be true: 
you learn something better when you teach it. 

When applied to American university classes, 
the flipped method has shown promising results. 
At Stanford University, this model was enacted 
in CS229A: Applied Machine Learning. When 
the class flipped, grade distributions showed that 
students performed just as well as students in 
CS229, a lecture-based class on machine-learning

produced by the nonprofit organization 
Invisible Children, was an effort to raise 
awareness about the atrocities committed by 
the Lord’s Resistance Army in Uganda, led by 
Joseph Kony. However controversial Invisible 
Children’s tactics may be, it is undeniable that 
the organization inspired people worldwide to 
take new interest in Uganda’s problems through 
this video.

As of Saturday morning, “Kony 2012” was 
viewed over 65 million times on YouTube. The 
social media sites Facebook and Twitter were 
bombarded last week with posts and tweets 
about the film. Virtually overnight, Kony’s 
brutality became known around the world.

Many celebrities such as Will Smith, Oprah 
Winfrey and J.K. Rowling are taking advantage 
of their prestige to spread the word about 
Kony via Twitter. Justin Bieber alone has over 
18 million followers on Twitter, who all saw 
his tweet "It is time to make him known. I’m 
calling on ALL MY FANS, FRIENDS and 
FAMILY to come together and #STOPKONY.”

This celebrity powerhouse is not merely 
promoting a one-sided picture of Uganda’s 
problems. Movie stars Don Cheadle and Kirstie 
Alley both expressed desire to find out the full 
story first, and make sure they are acting as 
‘helpers’ and not paternalistic encroachers.

While the effectiveness of Invisible 
Children’s proposed solutions is up for debate, 
the organization deserves credit for stimulating 
worldwide debate about the atrocities 
committed in Central Africa.

QUICK TAKES ON MARCH 5, INVISIBLE CHILDREN RELEASED A YOUTUBE VIDEO DETAILING THE ATROCITIES THAT WARLORD JOSEPH KONY HAS DONE IN UGANDA AND OTHER CENTRAL AFRICAN COUNTRIES SINCE THE 80’S. 

There is no doubt that the “Kony 2012” 
campaign is well-intentioned, but the endeavor is 
entirely misguided, oversimplified and disrespectful 
to the Ugandan people.

For one, of the $30 spent on an “action kit” 
composed of “Kony 2012” paraphernalia, only 37 
percent actually goes towards “helping” Ugandans. 
Also, instead of going towards initiatives that 
would help Uganda take care of itself — education, 
infrastructure and peacekeeping, for instance — 
Invisible Children has admitted that part of this 
funding is used to lobby for the U.S. government to 
support the Ugandan state military. The rest of the 
funding goes towards employee salaries, overhead, 
travel, advertising and filmmaking. 

It’s true that Joseph Kony has committed 
horrendous crimes that must be stopped, but the 
Ugandan military isn’t exactly clean either. This 
isn’t a case of “good vs. evil” — the situation in 
Uganda is far more complex and convoluted than 
what can be condensed into a 30-minute film.

Despite the improvements made in Uganda 
thanks to African-led organizations such as Project 
Diaspora, the campaign ignores these homegrown 
peacekeeping organizations. It maintains a distinct, 
paternalistic attitude that Africans cannot take 
care of themselves and are incapable of aiding 
Westerners in their own countries.

Instead of spending money on trendy “Kony 
2012” T-shirts that are being used to purchase 
machine guns in an already war-torn country, 
the public should get educated about the issue 
and support other trusted organizations that 
actually understand the complexity of the problem 
and recognize the value of the African voice in 
humanitarianism.

The 30-minute video “Kony 2012,” released 
March 5 on Vimeo and YouTube by Invisible 
Children, has become a phenomenon like 
“David After Dentist” and “The Numa 
Numa Dance,” garnering over 65 million 
views on YouTube and over 15 million on 
Vimeo. With the Kony 2012 video campaign, 
Invisible Children is doing something truly 
extraordinary: it is using the internet to bring 
awareness to a neglected cause.

And here's the incredible thing: it isn't funny, 
or grotesque or disgusting. It doesn't involve 
ugly people singing badly, children high on 
anesthetics or bald men dancing in unexpected 
ways. Instead, it's timely, educational and 
moving — three things viral videos tend not 
to be. The subject of the video, Joseph Kony, 
has been terrorizing villagers in four Central 
African countries for nearly twenty years. His 
tactics include kidnapping children, burning 
down huts and outright massacre — tens of 
thousands of civilians have been slaughtered by 
Kony’s Lord’s Resistance Army.

These are the undisputed facts. In light 
of them, the public's former ignorance is 
shocking. The first step to solving the problem 
is spreading awareness — precisely what the 
Invisible Children campaign aims to do.

Whatever else may be debatable — which 
Central African country Kony is currently 
occupying, or where the video was shot — is 
trivial by comparison. Invisible Children is 
attempting to inform the public and evoke its 
empathy for an issue an ocean away, the first 
step to solving an incomprehensibly complex 
problem.

Flipped Model Involves More Interaction With Material 

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
In reply to Benjamin Pope 

‘08: I suggest Mr. Pope read “The 
Game of Life,” co-authored by the 
former president of Princeton, 
William Bowen. Using a 
comprehensive data set, Shulman 
and Bowen show that in recent 
decades, there are large gaps in 
academic qualifications between 
recruited athletes and applicants 
at large, even at the academically 
elite Division I schools. 

Furthermore, recruited 
athletes in many cases comprise 
more than 50 percent of the 
bottom third of the classes at 
these schools. In other words, 
recruited athletes in Division I 
are less qualified for admission 
and perform significantly worse 
in academics than their peers. 

The gap is smaller at the 
Ivy League schools, which 
do not offer scholarships and 
implemented common academic 
standards for recruited athletes 
in the 80s; however, even at the 
Ivies, the gaps in qualifications 
and performance are significant.

Stanford and UC Berkeley are 
poor examples as I mentioned 
in my letter on February 9 — 
they have seen a number of 

athletic scandals, including 
the circulation of a list of easy 
courses to Stanford athletes and 
Cal basketball players receiving 
grades in courses they never 
attended. 

It bears repeating that 
universities are academic 
institutions whose primary 
missions are and must be 
educational. It seems hard to 
justify passing over students 
who have excelled academically 
in order to recruit athletes 
with poorer grades and test 
scores whose subsequent 
academic performance is poor 
in comparison to their peers. 
Stanford, Berkeley and the Ivies 
are no exception to this rule.

Grade Gap is Larger for 
Recruited Athletes

QUITE FRANKLY By Lior Schenk

algorithms. Professor Ng, who introduced this method in 
CS229A attests that the interactive aspect to traditional 
lectures have evaporated. In typical lectures, most students 
are dozing off, typing furiously, or on Facebook — while the 
brain in the front row actively answers all of the questions. 
This allows very little participation, “whereas in contrast, 
using online videos and interactive quizzes, every student 
gets to attempt an answer” says Professor Ng. 

Of course, the flipped classroom is not a perfect solution. 
Because college professors who have made the flip tend not 
to release attendance statistics, most of the data we have on 
flipped classrooms was collected by high school teachers. 
Commentators such as Lisa Nielsen at Tech and Learning’s 
‘Advisor Blog,’ point out that the online availability of 
course materials in a flipped classroom might reduce 

students’ incentive to show up for lecture. To counteract 
this tendency, professors would have contribute a portion 
of each student’s grade to attendance and participation, to 
ensure that students were rewarded for actively being a part 
of the lecture. 

The most crucial thing about the flipped classroom 
is that it helps students develop the skills they need to be 
successful at work through social interaction with peers that 
fosters deep understanding of the curriculum. Faculty at 
UCSD should take steps toward flipping classes of its own. 
For a cash-strapped university with little instructional time, 
and students who value more than ever the training to land 
a well-paying job, flipping is far more than a pedagogical 
gimmick — it may be the best move we have.

Do-it-yourself (DIY) tutorials can often inspire the thought, “Honestly... WTF,” since many require top-notch creative 
skills. Fortunately, UCSD alumnus Erica Chan 
Coffman understands the plight of the broke fash-
ionista with elementary school-level craft skills, 
using the aptly titled website “Honestly WTF” to 
share DIYs more comprehensible for those who 
don’t actually know what a leather rotary punch is.

“I realized that there was a lack of good DIY 
blogs — like fashion related DIY blogs — out there 

with really clear and concise, comprehensive 
tutorials,” Chan Coffman said. 

Looking for a new creative out-
let outside of her job as a jewelry 

designer, Chan Coffman consid-
ered creating a fashion blog. She 
admired some of the DIY blogs 
she followed, but found herself 
unsatisfied. 

“I like making things and 
I was able to sell things and 

people really liked my designs but it got to a point 
where I was sort of sick of doing that — like, sell-
ing my designs,” Chan Coffman said. “I’d rather 
not sell my ideas, but share my ideas.”

In a moment of inspiration, she recruited her 
friend Lauren Colodny, and Honestly WTF was 
born. Since then, the website has expanded to 
include everything the two creators love: art, travel, 
home design, beauty and menswear.

“[Lauren] really was the only person I could 
turn to…we shared a common thread,” Chan 
Coffman said. Out of all their friends, they were 
the only ones who have always wanted to work in 
the fashion industry.

Releasing their first DIY online on June 28, 
2010, these two ladies began documenting their 
love for fashion and their unconventional DIY 
adventures. 

DIY can appear very daunting. Leather cutters, 
decorative moldings and walnuts aren’t exactly

LIBRARY SEUSS ROOM 
The HLHW winter series concludes on March 12, 
with a presentation by Yale University historian 
Timothy Snyder, the author of Bloodlands: Europe 
Between Hitler and Stalin. Since its release in 2010, 
his book has created a sensation in intellectual 
circles both in the U.S. and abroad. Bloodlands has 
been described as a new kind of European history, 
presenting the mass murders committed by the Nazi 
and Stalinist regimes as two aspects of a single 
history. Snyder will discuss the implications of his 
unified approach to 20th century European history 
and how it alters our understanding of Nazism and 
Stalinism. The talk and subsequent discussion will 
be moderated by Amelia Glaser, director of the 
Russian and Soviet Studies Program at UC San 
Diego.

FOREIGN POLICY OF BANGLADESH: THE SEARCH 
FOR IDENTITY, SECURITY AND DEVEOPMENT- 
ERC ADMIN BLDG ROOM 115
The challenge of Bangladesh's foreign policy is to 
find ways to enmesh itself in a web of extra-regional 
economic and political linkages that will enhance 
global stakes within and also close the power gap 
with other pre-eminent regional protagonists.  The 
lecture will focus on main determinants and 
objectives, decision-making process, concerned 
institutions, and different phases of Bangladesh 
foreign policy. Syed Muazzem Ali, former Foreign 
Secretary of Bangladesh, retired from the Foreign 
Service in December 2001.  In 1971, he left the 
Pakistan Embassy in Washington, DC to join the 
Bangladesh Independence Movement.  Ali 
spearheaded the initiatives for proclamation of 
International Mother Language Day, and his current 
interests are in the interplay of democracy and 
development, and confidence-building measures 
and peaceful resolution of conflicts in South Asia.

Birch Aquarium SEA 

E very third Saturday of the month, Birch Aquarium pres-ents SEA (Science, Exploration 
and Adventure) Days 
— a multi-generational 
learning program that 
focuses on cutting-edge 
Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography research. 

And that time 
of month is quickly 
approaching; this 
Saturday, March 17, the 
aquarium — located on 
Expedition Way — will 
feature an event titled 
“Birds of the Sea” as part of the pro-
gram.

It’s a chance to learn just about 
everything there is to know about 
ocean-going birds — from their 
migration patterns to how they have 
adapted to life at sea. Scientists from 
Scripps Oceanography will be there to 
share about their research and answer 
any questions you may have. 

But for those of you who’d rather 
see these birds for yourselves, the 
reveal of the best bird watching spots 

will be worthwhile. For 
the more hands-on, there 
will be a bird crafts sta-
tion. 

The event takes 
place from 11 a.m. to 3 
p.m., and all activities 
are included with the 
aquarium admission fee. 
The price is discounted 
at $9 for UCSD students 
and staff who show their 
school ID. As another 

bonus, parking is free for three hours.  
But if birds don’t interest you, keep 

any eye out for the upcoming SEA 
Days. The program covers a vast array 
of topics concerning ocean explora-
tion, and chances are, one of them 
might float your boat.

L ike Wahoo’s and Yogurtland, another Orange County born-and-bred restaurant 
has expanded to our community. 
Since its successful second store in 
Huntington Beach, Slater’s 50/50 
moved onward and southward to San 
Diego’s Liberty Station neighborhood 
last November. Burger-centric eater-
ies are nothing 
new to the city 
of San Diego, but 
this is the only 
place that serves 
a patty composed 
of 50-percent 
ground beef 
and 50-percent 
ground bacon 
(hence the name 
50/50). Upon 
arrival at the res-
taurant, you are 
first greeted by 
a giant bronze burger in front of its 
expansive outdoor patio. The interior 
has mounted animal heads above 
the bar and flat screens everywhere. 
It’s a comfy, energetic and casual 
environment that ultimately gives a 
contemporary sports bar feel to the 
restaurant. 

Although the pre-designed signa-
ture burgers are the central focus of 
the menu, Slater’s 50/50 also features 
a build-your-own burger, which you 
can customize and personalize to 
your likings. But the inventive menu 
is not limited to burgers. Slater’s 
50/50 serves specialty dishes and sal-
ads, inviting vegetarians as well. Pick 
2 Appetizer ($5.95) is another menu 
staple — we opted for the Sweet 
Potato Fries and the Panko Fried Mac 
N’ Cheese. The sweet potato fries are 
only memorable when dipped in the 
creamy pumpkin dipping sauce that 
comes with it, bringing some tangi-

ness to the standard sweet potato fla-
vor. The Panko Fried Mac N’ Cheese 
is a different story. A bite into one of 
the crunchy fried balls makes a nice 
crispy sound, quickly followed by 
the warm, thick cheese. The Tapatio 
ranch sauce perfects the flavor. The 
50/50 ($9.95) is a burger that has the 
famous 50/50 patty topped with an 
egg sunny side up, avocado mash, 
pepper jack cheese and chipotle 
mayo, all served on a white brioche 
bun. Designed to perfection, or so 
they say, it is a big, hearty burger 
with a thick patty that offers the best 
tastes of the ground beef and ground 
bacon. But it’s no thrill — the burger 
is not hot enough to feel and taste the 
complete juiciness of the patty inside 
your mouth. Although the spreads 
nicely add to the overall flavor, they 
create quite a mess while eating.

The Peanut Butter and Jellousy 
($10.45) speaks a lot with just the 

name. Slater’s favorite burger, it has 
Sterling Silver ground beef topped 
with thick cut bacon, creamy peanut 
butter and sweet strawberry jelly 
served on a honey wheat bun. As 
strange as it seems, the combina-
tion actually works. This, however, 
is mostly because both parts of the 
meat are almost tasteless due to the 
dominating flavors of peanut butter 
and jelly. 

The textures of the meat are still 
there, but the flavors are gone, mak-
ing the burger taste like a regular 
PB&J sandwich.  With great appetiz-
ers and a large tap bar that includes 
over 100 craft beers, a weekend at 
Slater’s 50/50 would be enjoyable for 
sports fans, though the burgers them-
selves are ultimately lost in the shuffle 
of a town with enough great patties.

items found in the average dorm room. But not 
all of Honestly WTF’s tutorials are as intimidat-
ing as you’d think. Chan Coffman and Colodny 
have made these creations obtainable — even 
to the artistically challenged — through their 
step-by-step, Do-It-Yourself for Dummies 
instructions.

Starting with Shibori as their first DIY, 
Honestly WTF opened the door of possibili-
ties. Shibori — a Japanese method of dyeing 
cloth by binding, stitching, folding, twisting and 
compressing — can be used to create elaborate 
patterns due to the endless variety of folds and 
bindings with objects and rubber bands. Only 
a box of dye, a few rocks and rubber bands 
away from creating your own fabric patterns, 
this DIY consists of step-by-step instructions 
accompanied by picture accounts of their expe-
rience making it.

“”I never post a DIY unless I can tell 
you exactly where to buy the supplies, Chan 
Coffman said. “Nothing is ever a mystery. If I 
post a DIY, I’m going to tell you where you can 
buy a leather cutter, it sounds intimidating, it 
sounds like why would I ever need a leather 
cutter, but it’s only like $4.99 at the store. You 
can get it on Amazon and it ships for free.”

Making DIYs available to everyone, 
Honestly WTF has opened the door for trendy 
individuality at affordable costs. These DIYs are 
not just about making something, but making 
something you would be proud of that you can 
actually use, unlike your childhood crafts hid-
ing in the back of your parents’ closets.

While keeping up with every fashion trend 
is greatly unrealistic, Chan Coffman suggests 
college students stock their closets with staple 
pieces, such as jeans, print tees and leather 
jackets. 

“Keep styles that will never die,” Chan 
Coffman said. “Invest in pieces that will stay in 
season such as navy cropped pants, a leather 
jacket, a fur vest or a poplin blouse with a 
cropped jacket; [get] something you can mix 
and match with staples.” 

Honestly WTF’s DIYs keep up with the 
trends too, such as their Miu Miu-inspired jewel 
studded heels — a simple, but chic variation 
of your favorite designer staple to add to your 
closet.

There’s more where that came from. 
Honestly DIY provides its followers with great, 
creative alternatives to the norm. Ranging from 
Chanel-inspired pearl hairpins to gold dipped 
glassware, it offers a plethora of creative crafts 
to create.

1500m race the next day. This 
weekend, the men saw four athletes 
move up on the UCSD all-time list. 
There were also four event winners. 
Sophomore pole vaulter Ben Berthet 
won his event with a clearance of 
15’5.75”, which moves him to No. 
7 all-time. Junior transfer Quentin 
McWhorter triple jumped 46’9” to 
move to No. 6 all-time. Senior Dane 
Sandifer had a massive personal best 
at 160’3” to move himself to No. 8 
all-time and tie for first in the meet. 
Finally, junior Kiley Libuit busted 
out a 190’5” personal record to move 
himself to No. 3 all-time, ahead of 
Dan Macks and behind his brother 
and previous school record-holder 

Brad Libuit, who graduated in 2007. 
Senior Jeff Head won the long 

jump, junior Ryan Eckert won the 
shot-put and junior Zack Nagengast 
won the hammer. “It was a great day,” 
Salerno said. “Having the San Diego 
Track & Field community together for 
one meet made this a special event. 
The real highlight for many of us 
was having the opportunity to honor 
long-time Mesa College Coach Dick 
Coxe for all his contributions to our 
sport in San Diego. Coach Coxe has 
been a mentor to a number of the 
coaches competing in the meet today, 
myself included.” Coach Salerno was 
himself hired by Coach Coxe for his 
coaching job as an assistant at Mesa 
Community College 30 years ago in 

1982. Gold medal-winning Olympic 
sprinter Monique Henderson was 
also present at the meet as a coach 
for Mesa. Mesa’s present coaching 
staff also includes Olympian discus-
thrower Jarred Rome. A limited 
Triton squad will compete this 
coming weekend at the Annual Aztec 
Invite at San Diego State’s high-rise 
parking lot track field. The hammer 
event is scheduled for Friday at 9:30 
a.m. at the UCSD Triton Stadium 
West. 

The rest of the events are schedule 
to start Saturday, March 16 at 8:30 
a.m. at San Diego State University.

bring Freidenberg off the court, in 
anticipation for Saturday night’s 
contest against fourth-seed Western 
Washington. The center was replaced 
by freshman McKennan Bertsch, 
who has logged time in just 11 of the 
Tritons’ 32 contests thus far. Bertsch 
had a big game, recording six points 
in her 16 minutes on the court. 
    The Tritons ended the half with a 
19-point lead, which they extended 
to as much as 27 in the second half. 

“We say respect everyone but 
fear no one, and we really try and 
take it with that mentality,” Carlisle 
said. All these teams are fighting for 
their season and we have to do the 
same thing.”

On Saturday, the Tritons 
faced Western Washington in the 
Round of 32. UCSD had faced 
Western Washington once before 
coming, beating the Vikings 
79-60 on Saturday, Nov. 12. 
       The Tritons pushed tempo from 
the start against the bigger, but 
slower Western Washington. With 
five six-footers in tow, Freidenberg 
had her hands full on the block, 
but the 6’1” senior came out big.  
       Freidenberg hit six consecutive 
points in the first four minutes, to 
put the Tritons up 11-5, while her 
aggressiveness on the boards forced 
the Vikings into foul trouble early. 
       From there, UCSD caught fire, 
pushing the lead out to 23-9, 
although Osga and Feder—the 
teams’ second and third highest 
points scorers — had yet to score.  
    When asked about the difference 
in UCSD’s play over the course of 
the five-month season, Western 
Washington head coach Carmen 
Dolfo said the Triton bench has had 
a greater impact on the game. 

“I think the biggest change was 
that I thought their bench did a 
great job,” Dolfo said. “I think at 

the beginning of the year, it was 
just their four. I was impressed with 
their whole team, coming off the 
bench.”

UCSD sixth man Megan Perry 
ended the first half with five points, 
off two-of-two shooting from 
behind the arc. The Tritons ended 
the first period with a 50-27 lead.

“I thought the way that we came 
out in the first half was some of the 
best basketball we’ve played all year, 
and I was very pleased with the 
energy and focus,” Charity Elliott 
said. “Our kids just did a great 
job. We beat a very good Western 
Washington team tonight and I’m 
proud of how we were able to get 
them on their heels early on.

Despite shooting 7-of-22 in the 
second half, Western Washington 
never managed to cut UCSD’s lead 
to less than 11 points. 

Carlisle led UCSD in scoring, 
finishing with 20 points, while Feder 
and Freidenberg both chipped in 19 
points and 14 points respectively. 

“Being tough, that’s what the 
playoffs are about,” Carlisle said. 
“The teams that get to this point, 
they’re great teams.”

UCSD will now face Alaska 
Anchorage in the Sweet Sixteen. 

Members of the Great Northwest 
Athletics Conference, the Seawolves 
also defeated Western Washington 
in their last conference game of the 
season by 15 points. 

“I think that Anchorage has a 
great inside game. Their posts will 
step up,” “San Diego has a great 
transition game, whereas Anchorage 
has the inside game. They’re a very 
different team, so it should be a 
good game.”

The West Regional final is slated 
for Monday, March 12 at 7:30 p.m. at 
RIMAC Arena.

Both the Triton men’s and women’s track teams brought home first-place team finishes 
in the annual San Diego Collegiate 
Challenge held Saturday, March 10 at 
Triton Stadium. 

The women’s team came out 
guns blazing to score 206 points to 
dominate San Diego State (131) and 
CSU San Marcos (114.5). The men also 
competed well, scoring 197 points to 

hold off San Diego Mesa (175.5) and 
Cuyamaca (109).

Leading the way for the Triton 
women despite heavy headwinds was 
senior sprints captain Jacqueline “Boo” 
Rose. Rose anchored the winning 
4x100m team of Caitlin Meagher, 
Kathleen Hitchens and Chelsey 
Kamson; the team’s time of 47.64 
seconds was good enough for seventh 
all-time in the UCSD record books. 
Rose went on to win the 100m open 
by 1/100th of a second at 12.28, out-
leaning San Marcos’ Krystle Osby by 

a nose. 
Rose also won the 200m dash and 

anchored the winning 4x400m relay 
team of Lauren Irish, Lorato Anderson 
and Meagher. 

Meagher also won the 400m, and 
freshman Sabrina Pimentel took the 
400m dash.   Senior Erin Langford 
continued her dominance in the 
triple jump, going 37’11” for the win. 
Langford’s long jump mark of 18’9.25” 
was good for first place, and also 
moved her to fourth all-time for the 
women’s teams.

On Friday, UCSD Head Coach 
Tony Salerno said something that 
hasn’t been heard in four years: “The 
men’s team has a shot of winning 
CCAAs this year.” 

Salerno explained that Chico’s usual 
dominance in the distance events— 
where the team often scores most of 
its points— is missing this year. The 
Wildcats still have a few good distance 
runners, but now UCSD has a few of its 
own, particularly in Triton sophomore 
Kellen Levy, who, incidentally, won the

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL—In a 
near-empty media room, an NCAA 
correspondent ended the women’s 
basketball press conference by asking 
UCSD’s three seniors for one word to 
describe what it would take to go the 
distance in the postseason. 

       Center Lauren Freidenberg 
alongside guards Daisy Feder 
and Chelsea Carlisle were all in 
concordance in front of the camera, as 
the trio seemed to have been this entire 
season on the court.

“Fight,” was the word UCSD head 
coach Charity Elliott’s first recruiting 
class all agreed upon. 

    With two wins under their belt in 
the NCAA Division II Tournament, the 
No. 4 Tritons head into the Round of 
Sixteen against No. 8 Alaska Anchorage. 
       On Friday, coming off a loss in 
the CCAA conference semifinal, 
the first-seeded Tritons rebounded 

to take a 66-84 win against last-
seeded CCAA opponent Chico State.  
    The Tritons maintained a double-digit 
lead over the Wildcats all throughout 
the second half, as UCSD took its 
third season win over Chico State.  
       “We’re just excited and glad to 
get this one under our belt,” Elliott 
said. “We knew Chico would come 
out and battle as they always do. What 
I loved tonight was our energy, our 
intensity on both ends of the floor.” 
       Chico State struggled from the 
onset as it went without junior point 
guard Synchro Bull, the Wildcats’ 
leading points scorer, as well as 
Chico’s leader in steals and assists. The 
absence of Bull pushed Chico guard 
Courtney Hamilton into the point 
guard position, hurting the Wildcats 
as they lost their spot-up shooter.  
    The Tritons took a 12-1 lead within 
the first five minutes of play off 
back-to-back Carlisle three pointers. 
With an early lead, Elliott elected to 

Cross town, while San Diego State readies itself for March Madness, less than half of the 
Guardian staff (a representative 40 
percent) sullenly fills out Division II 
Women’s Basketball brackets.

As we only half-ironically mulled 
over whether Lander or Limestone 
would claim the southwest region, 
I decided to crunch numbers. 

Inspired by an article that examined 
the predictive power of a regular 
season conference championship in 
a given team’s performance at the 
NCAA National Championships, and 
UCSD’s recent loss in the CCAA 
Conference tournament, I started 
looking at Division II basketball 
records. What I learned, aside from 
the fact that finding 2006 Division 
II Women’s Basketball statistics for 
Florida Gulf Coast University is 
every bit as difficult as it sounds, 
is that in my survey of 31 Final 
Four participants within the past 
10 years, only four went without a 
regular season title. Whereas as many 
as eight of the 31 teams went without 
a conference tournament title. 

Obviously, a regular season 
conference title is a much better 
predictor of whether or not a team 
will advance to the Final Four, 
than is a conference tournament 
championship. In general, it seems 
that the 

“Any Given Sunday” approach 
that teams bring to conference 
tournaments in the hope of a 
Tournament bid lends itself to much 
more exciting basketball, but also very 
erratic results. It seems as if nearly 
half of the time, the best team will 
not win the conference tournament. 
One team that has bucked the trend 
is Northern Kentucky. The “Norse” 
has been the only team not to have 
won a National Title without winning 
its regular season. The 2007 NCAA 
Division II Champion Northern 
Kentucky University went 28-8 
overall, for a ‘meager’ 77.8 winning 
percentage. 

In most circumstances, a 77.8 
winning percentage is nothing to 
malign, (for context, 2012’s San Diego 
State is 20-4 for a winning percentage 
of 80). However, I found that the 
average overall winning percentage 
of the 31 Final Four participants 
surveyed is an astounding 88.63 
percent. 

Even more impressive, the average 
winning percentage of the past 11 
Division II National Champions I 
found to be 91.2 percent, (a figure 
that would be much higher if not for 
anomalous Northern Kentucky).

And so, how does this year’s 
women’s basketball team stack up? 
The Tritons ran away with the regular 
season title but lost the in the semifinal 
of their conference tournament last 
week. But with a 30-2 record, a 93.75 
winning percentage, the Tritons seem 
to fit the mold for the average NCAA 
Division II champion. But then 
again, so does UCSD’s next NCAA 
opponent 27-4 Alaska Anchorage.
