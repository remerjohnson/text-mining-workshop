Communication Professor Passes Away 
Helene Keyssar lost her long battle with cancer at age 57 
By _OFF DlmllCH 
Staff Writer 

UCSD communication professor Helene 
Keyssar died Monday morning after a lengthy 
struggle with cancer. She was 57. 

Keyssar is fondly remembered by the com-
munication department for her dedicated 
teaching style, leadership and innovative ideas. 

[n 1981 she arrived at UCSD and immedi-
ately made her mark by bringing her immense 
knowledge of theater and the humanities into 
the communication department. 

Communication professor Chandra 
Mukerji remembers Keyssar's dedication and 
love of students. "She had such joy being in the 
classroom," Mukerji said. 

The bond Keyssar had with students did not 
stop with the classroom. Often, she would hold 
film screenings at her home. Mukersi added 
that by taking students seriously, Keyssar 
taught them to understand and learn about 
themselves. 

Always popular with students, she was even-
tually forced her out of the classroom by can-
cer, but it could not keep her away for long. 
Soon after she was in remission she was back at 
school. even though she did not have to be. 

- Incredibly hard working and u;nacious· is 

how Mike Cole, a long-time communication 
professor, spoke of Keyssar's love of teaching 
and how she never gave up. 

"Helene had a lot to do with creating this 
interdisciplinary culture; said Dan Hallin, a 
communication professor. "She was a broad 
intellect; her background was in drama but she 
knew a tremendous amount about journalism, 
television, language and other things. All of us 
in the department learned a tremendous 
amount from her." 

Communication chair Carol Padden spoke 
of Keyssar's ability to bring the humanities into 
the a traditional social science department. 
According to Padden, she galvanized her stu-
dents with her juxtaposition of pop culture and 
the classics. . 

Keyssar also became a leader not only in the 
communication department but of women 
professors all over campus. Mukerji remembers 
that when Keyssar arrived from Amherst 
College in 1981 , women professors were few 
and were overshadowed by their male counter-
parts. Keyssar helped to break that barrier with 
her free spirit and drive. 

Throughout the '80s, Keyssar was adamant 
about improving US-Soviet relations. Her desire

ANTI-ZIONISM 
WEEK: PART 3 OF 3 

UJS Sponsors 
Speakers to 
Educate Students 
Week suggests altemate 
ways to promote peace 
By VINCENT GRAGNAHI 
Senior Staff Writer 

[n response to last week's Anti-Zionism 
Week, the Union of jewish Students is spon-
soring this week "A Positive and Pragmatic 
Approach to Peace in the Middle East; fea-
turing speakers and a booth on Library Walk 
Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. 

UjS President Wade Strauss said the pur-
pose of the week was to educate students 
more fully on what is going on in the region. 

"The purpose is to add something to the 
current issues facing [srael, to present some 
tangible proof and evidence of what is going 
on there," he said . 

Muslim Student Association President 
Eahab Ibrahim said that while he believes the 
UJS should have its voice heard, he objects to 
the fact that Wednesday night's speakers 
referred to Anti-Zionism Week as Anti-
Semitic. 

"Definitely they should make their views 
heard," he said. "I have no problem with that. 
But the tagging of our group as Anti-Semitic 
was a direct blow to us that's not substantiat-
ed by any actions that we've done." 

Dr. Richard Katz, a member of the 
American [srael Public Affairs Committee's 
national board of directors, and Rabbi 
Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the 
Wiesenthal Center, spoke Wednesday night at 
the Institute of the Americas Auditorium. 

Katz spoke about the current situation in 
[srael, giving a recent history of the peace 
process in the Middle East. He said he want-
ed to bring a sense of hopeful optimism to the 
situation. 

"There is no panic in Israel," he said. 
"There is no sense of fear. The streets are safe. 
It's much worse from a distance than when 
you're there." 

He added that Israel is choosing a peaceful 
political route in the Middle East. 

"Israel, if it wanted to, could prevail over 
the PLO; he said. "But they won't because it's 
not the jewish way, it's not the [sraeli way, it's 
not the way that country chooses to operate." 

Cooper then spoke on the use of 
Holocaust denial and anti-Semitic rhetoric by 
the Palestinian authority in its schools and 
media. 

"One of the biggest problems has been the 
failure of Israel to take a look and keep tabs on 
what Palestinian children are being taught; 
he said. 

Cooper ended his speech with a video pre-
sentation featuring several Anti-Semitic Web 
sites that have been indexed by the 
Wiesenthal Center. 

He said one reason for showing the sites to 
the crowd was to inspire them with the "cre-
ativity and commitment of the other side. " 

Thursday's speaker will be Deanna 
Armbruster, executive director of American 
Friends of Neve ShalomlWahat ai-Salam. 
Armbruster will speak and answer questions

Scripps Ritter Building to be Demolished 
Several new projects may help Califomians with the recent power crisis Like to meet 

people ... ? 
., IWIURIT O'NIILL 
Staff Writer 

Riner Hall, once the site of 
many classrooms and labs, current-
ly stands as only a concrete shell. 
The destruction of the large acade-
mic building, located on the cam-
pus of the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography, began Dec. 11 of 
last year. 

The company contracted to do 
the demolition is Clauss 
Construction. Bernard Clauss is 
the project manager in charge of 
the SIO project. 

Vaughn Hall, where the aquari-
um used to be located, is also 
scheduled to be demolished. This 
will occur simultaneously with the 
Ritter Hall demolition. 

Much of the material out of 
Ritter Hall is being recycled; 96 
percent, according to Clauss. 

"The only material not recycled

to lessen tension between the 
adversaries led to the innovative 
Space Bridge Project. The project 
consisted of a real-time video con-
ference between the two countries, 
with the United States' link at the 
UCSD Media Center. 

The video cast was the first of' 
its kind, llsing satellites to connect 
the. two countries. American chil-
dren were able to talk to Russian 
children. World War II veterans 
from both countries were able to 
reminiscence about old times. The 
video conference created a dia-
logue between the two sides at the 
height of the Cold W~r. 

Cole worked with Keyssar on 
numerous projects during hcr time 
at UCSD and commented on the 
joy she got out of seeing the two 
sides sit down and talk without any 
tension . 

Social activism found its way 
into much of Keyssar's work.

out of that building was the haz-
ardous material," he said. 

The first step to demolishing 
Ritter Hall was the removal of 
asbestos from the ceilings and 
other surfaces. The asbestos 
removal was completed last week. 

The air inside the building was 
then tested to make sure no air-
borne fibers we~e present after the 
asbestos removal. These particles 
are a health hazard if people inhale 
them. The building was pro-
nounced safe for workers, and 
demolition continued. 

Steel, metal and wood materials 
were removed from the hall next 
and sent to be recycled. The metals 
go to a recycler, where they are 
melted to form new steel for reuse. 

The wood products are either to 
be reused or sold as scrap wood. 

"When they're all done with 
that, all there is is a concrete shell: 
Clauss said. 

sonal is political. While teaching in 
the South, she worked on the civil 
rights movement. She even helped 
organize part of the funeral parade 
for Martin Luther King, Jr. 

Keyssari's belief and drive for 
social justicc lead to her thesis and 
first book, "The Curtain and the 
Veil: Strategies of Black Drama: 

Additionally, her role in the 
feminist movement led to feminist 
theater. Throughout her career 
she received many grants and 
awards, including fellowships from 
the MacArthur Foundation on 
International Peace and Security 
and the Rockefeller Foundation. 

Keyssar, a prolific writer of 
books and for film, theater and 
television, is survived by her hus-
band, Tracy Strong, a UCSD polit-
ical science professor, and her 
children, David Franke and Anise 
Strong, her sister Judith Redwing 
and her brother Alex Keyssar. 

A memorial service will be held 
Feb. 17 at 3:30 p.m. at the UCSD 
International House. 

In lieu of flowers, donations may 
be made to the UCSD Foundation 
- Attn: Helene Keyssar Fund, and 
sent to Paul Drake, Dean of Social 
Sciences, SSB 502, UCSD, La Jolla, 
CA 92093. 

This "concrete shell" is current-
ly still standing on the Scripps 
campus. According to Clauss, the 
demolition is approximately 75 
percent complete. 

Once the building has been 
completely demolished, the build-
ing will be crushed and used as 
road base or back-fill material. 
Road base is the layer put down on 
roads before asphalt or concrete is 
laid. 

The steel rebar of the concrete 
structure is also recycled after the 
concrete is taken to be crushed. 

The Ritter Hall and Vaughn 
Hall demolitions are scheduled to 
be completed March 23, 2001 . 

The space that will remain 
when the building is demolished 
will be turned into a park. The 
park will be built with funds pro-
vided by the family of a deceased 
Scripps graduate student as a 
memorial.

UCSD Committee 
Strips Students of 
Essential Rights 

As of this academic. year, UCSD stu-
dents are prohibited from retaining legal 
representation in administrative hearings 
of misconduct. By revising section 
22 .17.16.13 of the Student Code of Con-
duct, the Student Regulations Revision 
Committee - which, despite its name, is 
composed largely of administrators and 
staff - has struck a blow to the rights we 
have as students to defend ourselves 
against any university accusation of 
wrongdoing. 

The Guardian condemns any practice of 
restricting the ways in which students can 
affect potentially pivotal events in their 
academic lives. In a process that can have 
a significant negative impact on people's 
lives, a process in which students' acade-
mic futures can be at stake, no option 
should be denied students for their own 
defense. 

After the university got burned by the 
American Civil Liberties Union and its 
March 1999 lawsuit on behalf of UCSD 
student Ben Shapiro to revise the campus 
posting policy, the university took over a 
year-and-a-ha lf to actually change the 
policy despite a federal court order to do 
so. 

Despite the university's "oversight" in 
enforcing a federal court order protecting 
students' freedom of speech, it certainly did 
not fail to promptly thereafter rescind 
UCSD students' right to have legal repre-
sentation in administrative reviews allowed 
them since 1978, when the Student Code 
of Conduct was drafted. It seems the uni-
versity is more concerned with curtailing 
students' rights than it is with defending 
them. 

It is clear to the Guardian that students' 
rights are not getting the priority they 
deserve at UCSD. The new policy certainly 
does not benefit students, in that students 
accused of wrongdoing will not be permit-
ted to have professionally trained represen-
tation protecting their rights. Student advo-
cates - who are valuable resources in these 
situations - simply have not been through 
the years of schooling attorneys have, and 
they should not be the only option the 
accused have. 

It is the view of the Guardian that nobody 
should dictate to students who are being 
accused of an offense how they should go 
about defending their own rights and inter-
ests.

Leadership Requires Staying True to 
Both Voters and Personal Principles 
The resignation of A.S. Programmer Cassandra Williams reminds students 
that defending one's principles requires as much strength as fulfi!ling duties 

IIJ JACOB WASSERMAN 
Staff Writer 

Dear Littles and Germinates, 
I was in the Round Table courtyard 

last spring when they announced the 
winners of the A.S. elections. I remember 
watching many faces light up with the 
Aurora Bor.lis of the victor, or freeze 
into the sporting grin of the also-ran . I 
remember the indrawn breath, and the 
ripples of applause, and the handshakes. 
I remember Doc Khaleghi's near 
aneurysm after his upset presi<!ential vic-
tory. I remember Eugene Mahmoud's 
solemn triumph, as he accepted the post 
of Vice President External with his head 
bowed and his arms raised high. Most of 
all, I remember Cassandra Williams' 
shriek of joy, and her explosion of phys-
ical activity. I swear she jumped high 
enough to see right into the third-floor 
office that had just become hers. She 
landed spinning. thanking and hugging 
every one in arms' reach. 

Forget that new Triton mascot. Who 
knew that the Tasmanian She-Devil went 
to our school? And whose bright idea 
was it to put her in charge of all A.S. 
events as our commissioner of program-
ming? And who knew she would do so 
good a job? And how could we let her 
quit? 

If you missed last week's A.S. Council 
Meeting - and most of you did - let me 
fill you in. I'll start by giving you an idea 
of what A.S. Council meetings are like: 
lots of odd references and comments 
that might be inside jokes or absurd 
blather, with a few traces of phrases sug-
gesting insight. 

You squint and peer through the 
bureaucratic murk of meaning, and sud-
denly, ahh, therel A sudden fountain-
head erupts from the spry woman at the 
microphone: Williams says she cannot 
continue in her post due to irreconcil-
able conflicts between the realpolitik of 
A.S. events pla.nning and the dictates of 
her religion and morality and con-
science. 

In her own words: "Officially resign-
ing the . position of programmer, I feel 
obliged to tell you the reasons for this 
decision. Since before I ran for this posi-
tion, my family warned me that I would 
be alarmed about some of the things ( 
saw and that I would either have to com-
promise my morals or compromise my 
duties to the office. Of course, I didn't 
listen and I took the position." 

"From the beginning, r was shown 
some of the darker sides of life. Many 
people in the industry have tried to sue 
me, breached contracts with me, 
harassed and abused me and my friends. 
This may seem as though I want to live 

Perhaps if more people were 
as strong as Williams, the 
support could have been there 
to actually change 
circumstances and prevent the 

Lord Acton wrote that power tends to 
corrupt, but said nothing about how 
power tends to cling. Nobody likes leav-
ing a job half finished, especially when it 
means giving up a significant amount of 
authority, extra-especial1y when that 
authority comes hand-in-hand with 
responsibilities to people who voted for 
you over somebody else. Holding power 
and staying uncorrupted pales in com-
parison to the challenge of letting go of 
the reins when the time comes. 

Williams faced both these challenges 
and prevailed. Don't take it from me 
alone! Read what Matt Powell, our vice 
president of finance, had to say: "A.S. is 
probably one of the most conflicted 
groups on campus. Members of A.S. reg-

Coping with Loving but Neurotic 
P •• nts Baffles Middle Child 

Random 
Ravings 

DIVYA RUNCHAL 

I am convinced that all stu-
dents at UCSD at some point in 
their lives have wished that they 
had different parents. The idea 
crosses my mind a few times each 
year when I struggle to compre-
hend why it was my luck (or lack 

• of it) to be my parents' second 
and most n,:glected child (at least 
in my view). 

I know some people might 
think I should be grateful for my 
parents - they are for the most 
part loving, intelligent and 
responsible creatures - but a lit-
tle part of me resents them for 
being so tormenting. 

·A recent incident in San 
Diego, in which I was stranded in 
the cold for more than two hours 
beca.use my car wouldn't start, is 
testimony to my unhappiness 
with their neurotic behavior. 

Normal parents would have 
been concerned for their child's 
safety. My parents wanted to 
know what light I had left on in 
the car that could have caused 

the battery to fail. Normal par-
ents would have comforted their 
child with sweet words and 
encouragement. My parents told 
me to call my uncle in Los Ange-
les and ask him for help (as if he 
could have somehow tele-trans-
ported like an alien on "Star 
Trek"). Normal parents would 
have arranged for a tow truck 
company to jump-start the car. 
My parents told me to take my 
apartment key off my key chain 
so the tow truck driver would not 
attack me in the middle of the 
night, when I was fast asleep . 

As my anger rose, elevating to 
a point that would have put the 
hot geysers at Yellowstone to 
shame, I struggled to restrain 
from screaming every epithet 
known to man at my parents 
who, in an ironic twist, were 
actually losing patience with me. 
Worse, my Ph.D.-possessing 
father suddenly began to pound 
me with a swift succession of irri-
tating and illogical questions. 

The worst was, "Where are 
you exactly on the freeway?" to 
which my exasperated reply was, 
"Dad, how can I be on the free-
way when I just told you the car 
is stuck in the parking lot of an 
apartment building?" 

Don't get me wrong. I'm not 

an ungrateful brat (at least not 
most of the time), but how is it 
possible for me to be a perfect 
child when I don't have perfect 
parents? 

Perhaps what bothers me 
most is that my p.arents are 
unabashedly, shamelessly fair. 
Most students would not have a 
problem with that. In fact, they 
would probably hunt me down 
and chastise me for writing a dia-
tribe against crazy (but essential-
ly good) people. 

Yet, I have come to realize that 
my parents don't worship me, 
which is a sign that either A) they 
hate me or B) they're mature. 
Being mature is a good thing, but 
not when it is at the expense of a 
sweet, darling and innocent mid-
dle child (that's me, readers). 

A little while ago, when I 
received an angry condemnation 
from an individual, I ran to my 
parents, deeply hurt. Their 
response, "It's what you 
deserved." 

Sadly, I realized my parents 
weren't being sadistic: They were 
just taking his side in order to 
point out to me how he must 
have felt in that situation. I rant-
ed and raved about the unfair-

A story I heard recently made 
me think about the country we 
live in ... actually the capitalistic 
society that revolves around us. 
There is no doubting that most 
Americans live to 

that the dealer should not have 
sold him the drugs, for the dealer 
was aware of the individual's 
addiction. The dealer should have

think about the 
hypocrisy that aris-

one to blame but himself. 

But here is where it gets a little 
iffy. As absurd as this man's case 
seems, one should realize that the 
federal government of the United 
States similarly sued a drug dealer 
for negligence. Only in that case, 
the company was the tobacco 
industry. 

"The tobacco industry!" you 
say. "What does that have to do 
with crack dea lers?" Well, the 
tobacco industry and its con-
sumers are analogous to the crack 
dealer litigation. America sued the 
tobacco industry on the basis that 
it seIls a product that is addictive 
to its user, and ultimately calises 
harm. 

The government said,just like 
in the drug user's case, the tobac-
co industry was acting negligent-
ly when considering the hearth of 
its consumers. [ pose this ques-
tion : Why does it seem prepos-
terous when the drug user sues 
his drug dealer, but not when the 
government sues the tobacco 
industry? 

Some may argue that th e 
tobacco industry was aware of the 
effects of nicotine, and thus it 
increased doses to assure profits 
from addicted cigarette smokers. 
This knowledge of the effects of 
nicotine should be enough cause 
to stop production for the indus-
try to further research and notify 
its consumers. 

It is this negligence for which 
the governmenr sues. But this 
does not show that the drug case 
is less reasonable than the tobac-
co case. The drug dealer also relies 
upon the addictive effects of crack 

or cocaine to make profits as a 
dealer. . . 

Again, [ wonder why one case 
seems more rational than the 
other. 

Some also argue that the dif-
ference between the two cases is 
the differentiation in the selling of 
legal and illegal goods. The tobac-
co industry sells a legal product, 
therefore if it is discovered that 
this product is harmful , the tobac-
co industry should halt the sale of 
this product. 

In the end, I wonder 
when Americans will 
start owning up to their 
actions, while preseroing 
the capitalistic nature 
which has brought us so 
far ... Americans seem to 
want both the benefits of 
capitalism and the 
freedom and safety 
provided to us by the 
Constitution. 

Also, the user of the illegal 
drug is taki ng a risk in using this 
drug if he knows it is illegal. He 
leaves all responsibility to him-
self, for he is the ultimate deter-
minant. 

This argument, however, fails 
for it does not consider the fact 
that both of the goods sold are 
similar in their addictive qualities. 
Ultimately, both goods are the 
same substance, for they cause 
harm and are addictive, and the 
consumer is taking a risk by using 
either. . 

[n the end, [ wonder when 
Americans will start owning up 

The UCSD Guardian 

to their actions, while preserving 
the capitalistic nature that has 
brought us so far? These cases 
have shown that Americans seem 
to want both the benefits of cap-
italism and the freedom and 
safety provided to us by the Con-
stitution. These benefits include 
the joys of smoking a cigarette 
and the profit gained from sell-
ing it. 

However, with these benefits 
comes the harm from the smoke 
and the ultimate lawsuit and 
attempted suppression of one of 
America 's oldest and strongest 
companies. Ultimately, these 
desires cause hypocrisy to form 
in our values, as shown with the 
cases above. 

This hypocrisy arises from our 
acceptance ·of tobacco companies 
into American society, for they, 
like all of us, are in the pursuit of 
money. 

However, when we discover 
something hazardous about the 
product, we immediately blame 
the company. We then allow our-
selves to destroy this industry. 
When the man of Vancouver tries 
to do the same to his drug dealer, 
we laugh at him. 

[n one case, America tells a 
man to be responsible for his 
actions, but in the other, America 
says the company, not the con-
sumer, is to blame. Thus, we 
become hypocrites whose capital-
istic sense drives us to look out for 
only ourselves and not the well-
being of all people. 

Ultimately, we must realize that 
man must stay true to all his 
brothers and sisters. After all, as 
John Donne said, "No man is an 
island, entire of itself; every man is 
a piece of the continent, a part of 
the main." So we must care for all 
man with equality and reason, and 
not let money decide the fate of 
our actions.

Last-Minute Court Ruling Requires 
Electricity Generator to Sell to calif ... Iia 

SACRAMENTO - Warning 
that the state was headed for more 
rolling blackouts. power grid oper-
ators won a last-minute court rul-
ing Tuesday that temporarily 
requires a major electricity genera-
tor to sell to Californ ia. 

A U.S. Department of Energy 
order that required out-of-state 
generators to sell to California was 
set to expire late Tuesday, and 
President Bush had vowed not to 
extend the order. 

The Independent System 
Operator. which oversees the 
power grid, requested a temporary 
restraining order forcing Houston-
based Reliant Energy Services Inc_ 
to continue selling power to the 
state. . 

U.S. District Coun Judge Judge 
Frank C. Damrell Jr. said not issu-
ing the order could cause "obvious, 
irreparable harm to the public and 
the ISO was likely to win on the 
merits of the case.' 

His order remains in effect until 
3 p.m. Wednesday when further 
hearings will be held. Two other 
generators, Dynegy Power Corp. 
and AES Pacific Inc. , were targeted 
by the ISO's coun action, but they 
agreed to temporarily sell more 
power and are not subject to the 
coun order. 

Damrell said the generators 
were refusing to honor a long-
standing federal requirement that 
they continue delivering electricity 
to the state during power emergen-
cies. 

Meanwhile, Gov. Gray Davis 
said Tuesday that his administra-
tion had reached agreement on the 
first batch of long-term energy con-
tracts that will be purchased with 
$10 billion in revenue bonds 
approved by state lawmakers last 
week_ 

Davis appeared to dismiss the 
ISO's court action during a CNN 
interview, calling it a "tempest in a 
teapot. • 

But Charles Robinson, general 
counsel for the ISO, said long-term 
contracts "might address a large 
part of the problem" but will not fix 
it en tirely. 

"We still have to purchase in 
real time: Robinson said. 

In other developments Tuesday: 
- A statewide Stage Three alert 

continued and was expected to 
remain in effect Wednesday. 

California's natural-gas 
shortage remained a pressing con-
cern. Suppliers of as much as two-
th irds of PG&E's gas needs have 
either halted shipments or warned 
they will do so unless offered cash 

up front by the casb-poor utility. 
Staci Homrig. a PG&E spoU:s-
woman, said no ronllXlS had beat 
signed by last night. aIIhough 6ft 
suppliers had agmd to nc:gobaIr 
future saIes.

Of that amount, $200 million 
comes from a new authorization m 
$500 million in a new powa--buy-
ing law Davis signed just six days 
ago. 

The Davis administration pre-
dicts the new SSOO million will be 
exhausted by Valentine's Day and 
yesterday sent a Ictter to lawmakers 
saying it plans to spend an addi-
tional SSOO million. 

By the end of Fdxuary, taxpay-
ers wiU have spent more than $1.5

visible capital of Israel, with the 
Temple Mount at its center for all

The words, in part slogans of 
the Israeli right wing, reflected 
Sharon's position that the disputed 
city, controUcd by Israel, should 
not be shared. 

That position sharply contradicts 
proposals for sharing the city as 
mapped out by former U.S. 
President Bill Clinton. Much of 
jerusaIem was captured by Israel in 
the 1967 war and is seen. by the 
world as occupied territory to be 
resolved in negotiations. 

Clinton's proposals were 
embraced by outgoing Prime 
Minister Ehud Barak. Sharon

winning 62.5 pcrcmt of the vote to 
Bank.'s 37_4 pmml 

Sharon's predecessors have also 
made post-dection day trips to the 
\\btan Wall, which stands at the 
base m the holy site known to Jews 

of the Evangelical Catholic Church 
in America, a reform Catholic faith 
community. 

"I am a pastor to people who are 
gay and lesbian," said the Rev. 
Reine Abele, a United Church of 
Christ minister. "I want to affirm 
their relationship and acknowledge 
that God has called them." 

Abele was among about 25 
members of the Religious Coalition 
for the Freedom to Marry who 
gathered Thcsday at St. Paul's for a 
prayer meeting. 

They made plans to observe 
Monday's National Freedom to 
Many Day, a nationwide effon by 
gay rights and religious organiza-
tions under the sponsorship of 
Lambda Legal Defense to draw 
attention to the fight for same-sex 
marriages. 

The religious coalition, formed 
in 1998, issued a declaration calling 
for civil recognition of gay and les-
bian maniaF, and now counts 
about 300 tndfvidual clergy and 
churches as supporters. 

Signers include members of the 
United Methodist, Roman Catholic 
and American Baptist churches. as 
well as Unitarian Universalists, 
Reform Jews, Quakers and 
Episcopalians.

as the Temple Mount and to 
Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary. 

That hilltop holy site was at the 
heart of the failed Camp David 
peace talks in July. It is a cen-
turies-old mosque compound that 
Israel controls, but where it cedes 
day-to-day management to 
Palestinian Muslim leaders. The 
compound was once the site ofthe 
central Jewish temple, destroyed in 
70 A.D. 

Sharon's September visit to that 
disputed compound was answered 
by Palestinian riots that evolved into 
more than four mont!ts of fighting 
killing nearly 400 people, about 85 
percent of them Palestinians. 

Sharon did not head toward the 
sacred hilltop mosque compound 
Wednesday, but stayed at the base of 
the Wall, the customary Jewish 
prayer spot. He prayed for a few 
minutes while Orthodox Jews. many 
in customary black dress suits and 
fedoras, looked on and took pictures. 

According to one of the political 
supporters with him, Sharon read 
silently from biblical Psalm 122, 
offmng a prayer for Jerusalem: "May 
there may be peace within your walls 
and security within your citadels. • 

Peace and security were central 
themes in Sharon's campaign, but 
victory leaves him facing huge tasks.

Four Walls Provide Little Solace in Anjar's Killing Grounds 
ANJAR, India - Will you 

remember me?" 14-year-old 
Bhavika Vegad asked peering 
straight into my camera, the smilt: 
di sappearing from her face. 

How could I not? Bhavika 's 
world was turned upside down 
when a Jan. 26 eanhquake leveled 
her city. And I was there to bear 
witness. 

All around her, relatives, friends, 
classmates and teachers perished 
under the concrete and bricks that 
tumbled to the ground the day the 
eanh roared in Anjar. 

Six days later, a sprightly 
Bhavika roamed the rubble-filled 
streets, shielding her nose from the 

dust and dodging the debris in her 
path . She followed me from a tem-
porary clinic and shelter halfway to 
the devastated Mistry Failyu neigh-
borhood. 

"I miss going to school: she 
said in almost perfect English. "I 
miss my friends and teachers: 

No one knew when Bhavika 
would be able to return to school. 
Anjar ~as 65 ,()()() residents. And the 
only thing left here is misery. 

Now the journalists have started 
to leave Gujarat state. The relief 
age.ncies are also temporary. But 
Bhavika's life has changed forever. 

And, yet, in the midst of 
Gujarat's tragedy, her face was a ray 

of hope - an inspiration to begin 
healing. 

When I first arrived in 
Ahmedabad, the former stall: capi-
tal that has roughly the same pap-
ulation as Atlanta. the scale m the 
devastation eluded me. The airport 
in this industtial center is located 
in an area that was Iargdy spared. 

It was two days alta the massive 
temblor. It was midnight. I had 
bttn travdiag for almost 24 hours. 

I feh lucky that I had bun able 
to ~ a hotd room in a city 
suddenly bursting at the seams 
with media, dignitaries and relief 
workers. AU I wanted was the aJIII-
fort ora cIcan ~:_ 

The first sign that something 
was terribly wrong struck me as the 
auto-rickshaw made its way deeper 
into the heart of Ahmedabad. So 
many people were out in the streets 
- - some of them sleeping under 
the stars, others too scared to close 
their eyes. 

When I arrived at tht hotel , the 
dup fissures in the wall made me 
wonder whdher I. too, might not 
be beucr off sleeping in the street 

"This hotel is not safe: the 
auto-ricbhaw driver said_ 

That WIS aD it took. 1bat first 
night I slept in a dump 8CI'OIS from 
the niIwlIy station. But it was a 
dump without ~ in th~ l"pl,s. 

I found a better -room on my 
second day in Ahmedabad, in the 
Best Western Moti Manor. But I 
didn 't realize that the rail tracks ran 
past the back of the building. Every 
time a train went by, my heart raced 
at the thought that another after-
shock might be rattling the city. 

The seismology experts said 
Gujarat was experiencing after-
shocks at the rate of one every 
hour. It was hlVl1 to sleep at night, 
knowing that the walls could 
crumble around me at any 
moment.

The meeting itself was an 
achievement 
ContInued from ,.,e 1 
and Science, Anne Salo. 

Though the recognition of gen-
der inequity may be nothing new, 
solutions have been hard to come 
by. 

According to the Americ~n 
Association of UniverSIty 
Professors, the salary gap between 
male and female professors has 
increased by 3.3 percent since 
1975. 

Now, female professors earn 
12.5 percent less than men. 

This quantification put a num-
ber to a feeling that women have 
h eld fo r years. 

"There's definitely a sense that 
it 's more difficult to get th ings 
accomplished as a woman: Salo 
said.

~.rd R .... rcher 
Cracks Down on 
~ Colleg. Alcohol 

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - Henry 
Wechsler's name is synonymous 
with college drinking. 

In 1993 - four years before 
Scott Krueger drank himself to 
death at an MIT fraternity - the 
Harvard School of Public Health 
researcher's landmark Co llege 
Alcohol Study showed binge 
drinking on college campuses was 
far more extensive than anyone 
believed and [who .. . needs sub-
ject?l initiated a nationwide 
crackdown on student - binge 

drinking. 
"Our society has taken alcohol 

as a rite of passage: Wechsler sa id. 
"It's like living next to a fish factory 
- after a while you don't smell it 
any more." 

However, a core gro up of 
researchers and college administra-
tors attack both the accuracy of 
Wechsler's studies and the thinking 
that underlies them. 

They say Wechsler's definition 
of binge drinking is inherently 
flawed and classifies too many stu-
dents as problem drinkers. 

In an even more serious charge, 
they say Wechsler's s trateg~ of 
emphasizi ng the extent of dnnk-
ing on college campuses has back-
fired. 

Instead of reduci ng the level of 
college dri nking, they say, 
Wechsler has convinced students 
that binging is socially acceptable 
and has actually increased the 
number of students who drink to 
excess. 

Despite the widespread publici-
ty of his views, Wechsler's critics 
charge that his definition of binge 
drinking - five drinks for a man 
and four for a woman - is inher-
ently flawed . . . 

They say it has . no sCI~nt~fic 
basis, fails to account for a slgmfi-
cant number of other factors that 
influence the physiological effects 
of alcohol use, and classifies too 
many students as problem 
drinkers. 

Since Wechsler's first study, stu-
dents have become increasin~ly 
polarized in their drinking habIts. 
College campuses have seen fewer 
moderate drinkers and larger num-
bers of heavy bingers and abstain-
ers.

KIfC: Freddie Prinze Jr. is the king oj the silver sCTI!en along with co-star Monica POller in the romantic 
drama "Head Over Heels." 

Hard to fall head over heels with this film, even 
with Freddie Prinze Jr. playing the lead 
Iy USSANDA 
Staff Writer 

The quality of a film is often negatively 
correlated with the number of genres it tries 
to straddle. "Head over Heels· could be 
described as a romantic-crazy-drama-comedy 
with action elements. 

It is the concept of one "girl next door· 
(Monica Potter) living with four models, and 
she just happens to be good-looking herself. 
OK, fine. This is America, after all. 

Add living across the road from the 
vague exhibitionist Mr. Perfect (Freddie 
Prinze Jr.), who mayor may not be a serial 
killer. Then progress to pile up the cliches at 
a higher rate than your average Bon Jovi 
lyric. . 

A sense of humor based on bodily func-
tions and discharges can make for funny 
films. It's just that it's been done so much 
funnier, so many times before. That goes for 
every potential laugh-inducing element of 
this film: the makeover scene' ("Clueless·), the 
spying on neighbors ("Friends· ) and the list 
just goes on. 

In the last instance, the film suffers from 

trying to do everything at once and never real-
ly manilges to achieve anything. The only 
thing it has built to excess is the melodrama 
with quivering lips and knees. 

The action scene has been toned down to 
an insipid level. The models try to act but 
become, at best, caricatures of themselves 
next to the more developed main characters. 

Guys, they don't even have breasts, cause 
they're models, and models are too skinny 
to produce any luscious cleavage to speak 
of. 

I tried to amuse myself by reading mean-
ing into the Kate Moss-skinny script, but to 
no avail - unless the statements "Women 
can't be both beautiful and smart at the same 
time; they need men to save them" and "Men 
with foreign accents are villains· count as 
anything worthy of "meaning.· To me they 
don't. 

If you do have an irresistible urge to 
expose yourself to this film, at least hold back 
until it's released on video, so you can cringe 
in the comfort of your own home. Or alterna-
tively, go on Valentine's Day, because here's 
your chance to make out in the dark cinema 
without missing anything at all. 

'The· Invisible Circus' shows the dark side of the 
1960s but is a bit unconvincing 
IYUSSANDA 
Staff Writer 

"The Invisible Circus· portrays a dark side 
of the '60s, when drug abuse and political 
radicalism had become a substitute for real 
confrontation of the self. Sadly, it fails to be as 
much of an impact as it could have been. It is 
difficult to determine exactly why, but it is 
simply a bit unconvincing. 

The film attempts to portray people com-
ing to terms with an unforgiving past, the 
necessity and impossibility of letting it go, and 
how simple and draining it is to maintain a 
false memory of something lost. 

Phoebe, played by Jordana Brewster, is an 
18-year-old who leaves home to explore the 
circumstances of her idolized sister's suicide, 
which happened 'almost a decade before. 
Brewster captures the idealistic, self-centered 
perspective of someone that age, torn 
between rea li zation and denial, childhood and 
adulthood. 

Cameron Diaz does a decent job in her 
part as the sensation-seeking Faith through -

out the film's countless flashbacks, although I 
have personally seen her in one too many 
crazy comedies to lend her credibi lity of the 
sort required by her character. 

The best acting is by Christopher Eccle-
ston, who for the most part, lends genuine 
depth to the character Wolfe, who ends up 
the lover of both sisters in an attempt to rec-
oncile his contribut ion to the puzzle of 
Faith 's death . . 

Here's what I think happened to this film: 
They shot it, showed it to a focus group that 
expressed concern about numerous elements, 
hence it went back and was re-edited . • That 
would at least explain how the story flows 
seamlessly at times and then suddenly starts 
chopping like the motor of'a poor student's 
car. 

For those of us who have been around 
Europe a bit, there is amusement to be gained 
from playing "spot the location." And, if you 
ever had doubts about whether going on 
Interrail as a bohemian, fantastic experience, 
well , here's your answer: Too bad we missed 
the sixties.

12 HIATUS The UCSD Guardian 

To Some They're Still Giant 
Only the diehard fans showed up to support They 
Might Be Giants even with recent airplay 
By MICHAEL TURNER 
Staff Wnter 

Alternative band They Might 
B~ Giants played to an enthusi-
as tic but diminutive crowd at 
San Dlego 's 4th and B. Last year 
the band toured to commemo-
rate the 10-year anniversary of 
their album. "Flood." 

The 2001 tour is in reaction 
to the high turnout they received 
last year. ye t last Sunday's San 
Diego show did not sell out 
despitc the band's recent notori-
ety as the performers of the 
theme song to the sitcom "Mal-
colm in the Middle." 

The band catered to an audi-
ence composed of overwhelming-
ly die-hard fans by playing a good 
number of their older and more 
bizarre songs and B-sides like 
"Minimum Wage" and "Finger-
tips" along with such hits as 
"Don't Let's Start" and "Particle 
Man." 

The band's principal mem-
bers John Linell and John Flans-
burgh, and their three back-up 
musicians - all named Dan -
still managed to keep the crowd 
on its toes, introducing five 
unreleased songs and lapsing 
into improv segments. 

At several points the musi-
cians facetious ly emulated free 
jazz and incorporated the audi-
ence into the performance in a 
command-response rela tionship. 

These moments of spontaneity 
lent the show to a sense of fresh-
ness despite the fact that the audi-
ence could sing along with nearly 
all the material. But all roo obvi-
ous was evidence of the alleged 
rivalry between Linell and Flans-
burgh. 

While Flansburgh. the 
rhythm gui tarist. exhibited the 

CCUlesy of 4lhan1fl.com 

GI...ts: Members of alternative rock band, Thry Might Be Giants, stand tall. 

jovial attitude that the band is 
known for in his on-stage banter, 
Linell stood behind the keyboard 
and performed with a self-mock-
ing tone. 

The two seldom made eye 
con tact, even when they were 
alone on stage. This didn't disap-
point the crowd, as the band was 
coaxed out for two encores. 

But the conclusion the audi-
ence seemed to draw was that 
after 17 years al}~ multiple per.-
mutations, the band might be 
losing some of its original gusto 

as it moves into a slightly more 
com mercial sphere. 

Fortunately, the focus of this 
tour is the commemoration of 
that which set the band apart 
from the beginning. 

While the band is producing 
material that looks less and less 
like what made them famous, 
they've proven that they can still 
rock like they did almost two 
decades ago. If you're not famil-
iar with TMBG material, check

Breakdown to Heart-
breaks at Porters Pub 
At Heartbreaks, you can expect to find 
yourself in Heaven and Hell in the Pub 
By JOSEPH LEE 
Hiatus Editor 

The UCSD DJs and Vinyl-
philes Club will launch its first 
event of the quarter at Porter's 
Pub, and with Valentine's Day 
just around the corner, it is aptly 
titled "Heartbreaks." With the 
event being exclusive to and free 
for UCSD students, there is hope 
that there will be a strong student 
support for the show. 

Event coordinator Robin 
Duong hopes to see a lot of peo-
ple attend the show, which will 
showcase new members of the 
DVC as well as the talents of the 
more experienced members. 
Duong is excited about the event 
because it will give the new mem-
bers a chance to play on a large 
system in front of a large crowd. 

Heartbreaks will feature two 
areas of music, themed "Heaven" 
and "Hell." The Heaven area will 
be located inside the Pub and 
appropriately decorated with 
angels, stars, clouds and other 

Heaven-esque themes. Hell, of 
course, brings out the darker side 
with devils, fire and brimstone. 

The contmsting themes in the 
areas also separate the styles of 
music. Heaven is focused more 
on house, breaks and NU-NRG, 
while Hell has an obviously dark-
er mood with jungle and hard-
core DJs. 

Capacity is limited to 500 and 
early arrival is suggested. The 
event is free for UCSD students 
and there is no need to obtain 
tickets before the event - just 
show up with your student 10. 
This is most likely the DVC's 
only event this quarter.

today. 
Their last two studio albums, 

"Be Here Now" and "Standing on 
the Shoulder ·of Giants: seem 
overproduced and layered with just 
one too many guitars. They seem 
like they are trying too hard. But 
witt.- their recent live album 
"Familiar to Millions: Oasis prove 
that they are more than just a stu-
dio band trying too hard. 

This two-disc set shows off the 
raw talent and energy of Oasis 
pumped through Noel Gallagher's 
Marshall stack amps. You can feel 
the electricity as throngs of people 
at the famous Wembley Stadium 
chant "Oasisl Oasis!" until a mas-
sive arplaUSC greets the opening

Petite, saccharine horses that 

were either painfully shy or hope-
less romantics - girls were suckers 
for these pastel-coated equines and

totally immovable ponies that just 
posed there looking stomach-
churningly cute. In the show, the 
ponies had three human friends -
Megan, Molly and Danny - whom

the producer of 
Transformers fig-
ures, it was a spec-
tacular success.

all know that it was

The ponies 

always had celebra-
tions and parties 
for no apparent 
reason, and inces-
santly preached for 
love and kindness 
until maple syrup 
poured from the 
viewers' ears. But 
the toys' popularity 
dwindled, and the 
ponies went 
straight to the glue My friends and 

I bought almost every robot so we 
could re-enact their television 
adventures without 1:100 scale 
models of the patriarchal leader 
Optimus Prime, the aggravating 
Starscream and the hilariously use-
less Bumblebee who, playing the 
perfect foil, constantly found him-
self in trouble. Of course, the show 
always gained new characters, like 
the "Constructicons" (five earth-
moving robots that made one 
gigantic eatth-moving robot) and 
thus, there were more toys to buy. 
When Transformers were intro-
duced in 1984, there were perhaps 
30 Transformers total. By the 
series' end, the number grew to 
approxillJately 23,000 mechanized 
warriors. 

Transformers episodes are being 
released on VHS and DVD by Kid 
Rhino.

Only "My Little Pony: The 

Movie" can be seen on the hard-to-
find VHS by Vestron Video, and the 
episodes have not yet been released 
by Sunbow Productions. 

Old cartoons have been rising 
in nostalgic popularity, as many 
series and movies are being re-
released in some way or another. 
Oldies like "SilverHawks" (a spacy 
version of "Thundercats"), "Yogi 
Bear's lreasure Hunt" (in which all 
of Hanna Barbera's characters are 
featured), and "Chip and Dale's 
Rescue Rangers" are all on syndi-
cated rerun on the Cartoon Net-
work, Boomerang and the Disney 
Channel, respectively. "G. I. j.O.E: 
The Movie" is also now available 
on DVD. 

It's always good to take a break 
to stroll down memory lane. We're 
older now, but we can always fond-
ly reminisce about our young, 
stress-free lives when we sat too 
close to the television with a large 
bowl of Froet Loops and bathed in

Helen Folsade Adu , otherwise 
known as Sade, follows her 1992 
"Love Deluxe" (which carried the 
hit "No Ordinary Love") with 
"Lovers Rock," an album that 
masterfully blends her soulful 
voice with today's electronic 
rhythms. 

After the success of their first 
two albums, "Definitely Maybe" 
and "What's the Story (Morning 
Glory): Oasis have been criti-
cized for losing their touch with 
their last two studio albums. Liam 
makes the offhand comment, 
"You should write more of these 
songs, Noel: before heading into 
"Supersonic," a classic from their 
first album. . 

Oasis run through brilliant B-
sides like "Acquiesce· and ·Step

favorites such as "Wonderwall"

some recent flare with beats mas-

All in all, however, the tone 
and temperament on "Lovers

same, from the lush melancholy 
of "King of Sorrow" to the dub-

Crew com petes in an open

"There's definitely a gap 
between the top Division I schools 
and the top Division II schools," 
Pinkerton said. 

As far as fellow Division II 
schools are concerned, UC Davis 
is the school to beat. 

"We're at a disadvantage 
because Davis is at Division II," 
Pinkerton said. "They're a scholar-
ship school. They have a more 
aggressive policy toward athletics. 
But I think we have as much talent 
as they do."

Men: 
Whitzgell to lead team 
with U a lot of potential" 

well for the Tritons, as he took the 
c::ollegiate lightweight event with a 
time of 6:45.0. 

The freshman crew team was 
pa~icula.rly impressive as tlrey 
SWIped eIght of the top ten times. 
The first-year phenoms were led by 
Andrew Fisher with a time of 
6:31 .5. 

The rookies' performance has 
coach Casey looking forward to the 
new season. 

"The incoming freshman team 
is probably the best freshman team 
ever at UCSD; Casey said. "The 
biggest thing I'm happy with is our 
depth and tenacity; also our will-
ingness to work hard and meet the 
goals we set." 

The varsity team, however, will 
be looking to recover from the loss 
of key contributors to graduation. 

"The varsity will be good, but 
not as strong as last year,· Casey 
said. 

_ Varsity head coach Michael Fil-
ippone will be looking for returnee 

- Tom Whitzgall to lead this year's 
varsity team to its goals, which 
include winning the Cal Cup for 
Division IVIII and the San Diego 
Crew Classic on April 7 and April 
8. The Tritons are looking to 
avenge last year's loss, in which 
they came in second to Trinity Uni-
versity by less than a second. This 
year, UCSD has an extra incentive 
to beat Trinity as the previous 
freshman coach, Jim Oaks, is now 
an assistant for them. 

The Tritons are also seeking to 
extend their domination of their 
local adversaries. 

"We definitely don't like all the 
San Diego area schools: Casey 
said. "Since Filippone has been 
here we haven't lost to any of 

,those schools. There's this pride 
with not wanting to lose to them." 

With such a strong freshman 
group, UCSD crew will most likely 
be dominating its neighbors for a 
long .time to come. 

"This program has a lot of 
potential," Casey said. "Right now 
we're probably the fifth-best pro-
gram on the West Coast. We defi-
nitely have the athletes and the 
potential to be a top competitor." 

Add the fact that their event on 
Sunday was 2,000 meters, which is 
more sprint-oriented and shorter 
than mos"! programs are used to at 

. this point in the year, and their 
dominance is even more impres-
sive. 

"We have a lot of depth ," Casey 
said. "The biggest thing right now 
is fitness and mental toughness." 

To top it all off, the men's crew 
team this year has already landed 
three top-notch recruits from 
Orange Coast College. These 
recruits will help UCSD extend its 
dynasty well into the future. 

The Tritons will be looking to 
build on Sunday's performance 
this weekend, as they go head-to-
head with Loyola Marymount in a 
preseason scrimmage at Mission 
Bay.

draws a large crowd. In addition 
to providing lively golf festivities, 
the Buick Invitational also raises 
money for several causes includ-
ing the UCSD golf program. 

Over $4.5 million has been 
raised for local charities since the 
tournament moved to Torrey 
Pines. Other events that are 
scheduled include a Pro-Am tour-
nament and a junior golf clinic. 

The UCSD golf team, which 
also plays regularly at Torrey 
Pines, is selling tickets for the 
event to raise money. They are 

promoting it as a chance to see 
Tiger Woods up-close and in 
action. 

Ticket prices for the event are 
$19 per day for today and Friday, 
and $25 per day for the weekend. 
For those who want season 
badges, tickets are $65 in advance 
or $75 at the gate. A season badge 
allows entrance for all four days 
of the tournament. Children 12

H ey buddy. Yeah you, the big guy with the expensive haircut. Come over here a 
second and let me give you a bit of 
advice that will be of use to you 
now that you are a free man after 
that outrageous trial. 

Here it is; listen closely: Do not 
force yourself on underage girls in 
your family bathroom at an after-
prom party! Oh, and another thing: 
You are a famous professional foot-
ball player with millions of dollars! 
You can probably find a chick or 
two who would actually willingly 
get down with you. You wouldn't 
even have to force them into the 
bathroom and soil your wife's new 
towel set 

OK, OK, so according to the 
U.S. court system, this alleged inci-
dent did not actually occur. But if 
you listened to Mark Chmura's 
post-trial comments to the press, 
you might not believe the court's 
decision . When asked what he was 
going to do now that he has been 
acquitted, he fixed his eyes on the 
camera with one of his smirks and 
retorted, ''I'm going to Disney-
world." 

ow, it is common knowledge 
that Disneyworld is populated with

Men's Crew Looks to Youth to 
'Continue Last Year's Success 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's crew team 
kicked off its 2001 campaign last 
Sunday at 8 a.m. with the San 
Diego Indoor Rowing Champi-
onship in Mission Bay. 

Competing against other local 
teams such as San Diego State 
University, UC Irvine, Loyola 

Marymount, and the Unive,rsity 
of San Diego, the Tritons were 
able to hold their own and get a 
glimpse of what the rest of the 
2001 season has in store for 
them. 

"It went really well,' said var-
sity assistant coach Steven Casey. 
"The team's looking good." 

For the men's varsity team, 
crew member Brian Sullivan 

placed first in the event with a 
time of 6:12.2, which was an 
astounding four seconds faster 
than the second place finisher. 

Varak Smith was the only 
other top-10 finisher for the Tri-
tons, garnering a respectable 
eighth place with a time of 
6:29.3. Geffery Rapoport also did

Women's Rowing Team is 
BuHding a Solid· Foundation 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

UCSD women's crew is in the 
middle of a long rebuilding 
process. The results? So far, so 
good. 

The rowing team has been 
improving by leaps and bounds 
and looks to be even better than 
last year. 

"We're still a young team,· 
said UCSD women's crew head 
coach Patti Pinkerton. "Our big 
Issue last year was that we did 
not have much of a varsity so we 
lacked leadership. The challenge 
was to teach all of the skills to the 
novices without that leadership. 

They obviously met the chal-
lenge because they finished off 
the season really well.' 

2000's team was as young as 
they come. 

Now, with a year of experi-
ence behind it and a solid foun-
dation below it, UCSD crew is 
gearing up for the big dogs. 

"Now our challenge is our 
lightweight, because that's 
where our key varsity girls 
were,' Pinkerton said. "We have 
returning lightweights in that 
boat. We know they're in the 
ballpark because they got 
ranked last year." 

Two veterans who will lead 
the squad are Heather Beckman 

and Juli~ Snyder. 
"They're both four-year row-

ers, so they provide a lot of lead-
ership in the boat,' Pinkerton 
said. .' 

There are also a couple of 
younger talents in Emily Gray 
and Carrie Blemker looking to 
make their mark. 

· We have a·some really excit-
ing rookies,· Pinkerton said. 

Everyone on the rowing 
squad will get a chance to prove 
her metal. 

"Because we're such a devel-
oping squad, I move people 
around a lot,· Pinkerton said. "I

11 runs not enough 
in first game, six is 
sufficient in second 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD baseball team split a 
doubleheader against Vanguard at 
home Saturday. 

Pitching took the afternoon off 
during the first game as Vanguard 
won a four-hour offensive slugfest 
17-11. . 

UCSD's Ryan Larson scored 
three runs, and teammate Chad 
Addison drove in three. 

Vanguard's Ryan Williams 
picked up the win, allowing three 
runs on fiv e: hits. The Tritons' Erik 
Snyder got the loss after allowing 
four runs in one inning of work. 

The second of the two games 
was more to UgiD's liking, as they 
won 6-4. 

The game was called after six 
innings because of darkness. 

The Tritons' Andy Hanau 
picked up the victory, striking out 
seven batters. 

Vanguard's Brian Wood was 
given the loss after allowing three 
runs in one-third of an inning. 

Offensively, six different Tritons 
scored, and Chris Tallman and Blair 
Suzuki each drove in a pair of runs. 

Next up for UCSD is a pair of 
road .games. First, the Tritons travel 
to the University of Redlands for a 
game Friday at 2:30 p.m., then they 
head to Concordia University in 
Irvine for a garrJe S~turday at 11
