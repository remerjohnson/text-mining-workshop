A.S. Council supports fee referendum 
Resolution advises 'yes' 

. 

vote on expanSIon 
By MARNmE FEDERIS • 

GAELLE FAURE 
Senior Staff Writers 

The A. . Council passed a res-
olution urging students to vote in 
favor of the University Centers 
Expansion Referendum at the 
council's May 7 meeting. 
Appointed Special Elections 
Manager Gabe Grossman, along 
with members of the A.S. 
Elections Committee from the 
A.S. general elections, will over-
see the special elections for the 
expansion referendum, which will 
be held from May 12 through 
May 16. 

The referendum calls for a 
539 per-quaner fee for the expan-
ion of Price Center and renova-

tion of the Student Center. 
Aher over an hour of discus-

sion centering on the appropri-
ateness of the council taking a 
stance in an election that they are 
involved in running and whether 

or not this pre ented a connier of 
interest, the council voted to 
approve the resolution 13-6-2. 
The resolution was submitted by 
University Centers Advisory 
Board Chair james Lynch. 

From the outset of the discus-
ion , A . . Pre ident jeremy Paul 

Gallagher urged the council not 
to pass a resolution because he 
felt that the council should 
remain neutral. Shortly before 
the vote, he reiterated his posi-
tion and mentioned that using his 
presidential power of veto against 
a "yes" vote was an option he was 
thinking about. 

Council members argued both 
in favor and against the resolution, 
nOt on the grounds of the referen-
dum's ments but on the appropn-
ateness of the council to promote a 
vote one way or the other. 

"I think it's perfectly fine that 
we take a position as a body," said

End of lab contract may lead 
to loss of in-state tuition 

By THOMAS NEELEY 
Senior Staff Writer 

As the University of ,alifornia 
ponders its funlre relationship 
With Lo Alamos ational 
Laboratory, many currcnt and 
future UC .tudents from Los 
Alamos, .M ., are considering 
the poSSibility thai the price they 
pay to anend J UC mSti tutlOn

ate of Los Alamos High chool, 
the town's only public high 
school. 

"Everyone thinks its 0 fwmy 
that this one little high school 
ends up here all the time," said 
John Muir College graduate 
Sarah Leonard, who carne to 
UCSD from Lo. Alamo. " Its 
kmd ofJ1lce." 

Leonard, who graduated win-
ter quarter and who e parents 
work m the laboratory, is one of 
lIIany New MelOco nldents who 
arc able to attend U institution 
for Ill-State nutlon. Leonard said 
that the possibility that the 

University of California may no 
longer manage the laboratory 
might cause adverse affects on 
where Los Alamos tudents go for 
undergraduate and graduate 
nldy. 

"It IS a concern," she aid. 
"Younger i>ters and brothers 
won't have the option to come 
here, or If you are conSidering

The current contract is set to 
expire in September 2005. 

Janet Lynch, a senior at 
Thurgood Mar hall College, 
whose father worles in the labora-
tory, aid the incentive of paying 
in-state tuition is the primary rea-
on that she and so many Los 

Alamos students apply to the 
University of alifornia. 

"Thats the only reason I wa 
able to look at U schools," 
Lynch said.

Scientists discover reg. 
role of pseudogene 

SCientists In Japan and the UCSD School 
of MediCine have discovered a novel regula-
tory role for one pseudogene that could be 
used to reat human disorders. 

W,ile making transgenic mice for a com-
pletely different expenmen~ the researchers 
found that the pseudogene, called makonn 1-
p I because It IS SImilar to a ful~fledged proteln-
coding gene called makonn I, stabiliZes the pro-
teln-<oding gene on another chromosome. 

In examinations of normal mouse kidneys, 
the protein-<odlng makonn 1 was shown to be 
strongly expressea and highly ViSible. In mice 
IMth the disabled makonn l-p 1 pseudogene, 
the expression of the makonn 1 gene appeared 
weak and megular In the diseased kidney bs-
sue. Additional lab tests and expenments In 
mice determined that ma orin 1-p 1 played a 
key role In regulating the stability of makonn 1. 

When the pseudogene was disabled, pro-
tein production was compromised, resulting 
In abnomnal kidneys and bones In laboratory 
mice. W,en a functioning pseudogene was 
reintroduced into mouse embryos, the mice 
developed nomnally. 

The study IS published In the May I Issue 
of the IOU mal Nature.

Traditional dance performances by student Latino 
organizations at the Price Center signaled the start of 
UCSD's Raza Awareness Week on May 5, Ci nco de Mayo. 
The topic for this first day of community events was resis-
tance and history. 

"The events are organized in a way so that everyone, 
not ju t Latinos, can view it," said Manuel Ponce, a mem-
ber of Danza Azteca, the first group to perform. 

There were also performances by a mariachi band, a 
tradi tionally clad Chicano cowboy and rider, and a speech 
on the importance of cultural representation by Sandra 
Diaz, a San Diego State University alumna. 

"My friends are up there [performing]," Ponce said. "It 
is great. We are all participating." 

Raza Awareness Week was put together by a coalition 
ofU SD student organi7.,ations ca lled the Rna Awareness 
Week Committee. This year there were seven organiza-
oons involved. 

"We want to present cultural events to build awareness 
about our Latino and Clucano identity," said Cynthia 
Bercera, the emcee for the day and member of the Raza 
Awareness Week Committee. "We want people to know 
that Latinos have a culture to be proud of." 

Rna Awareness Week was puton with a purpose, orga-
nizers said. 

"Entertain, educate and welcome all ethruc groups is 
what we want to achieve this week," said Maggie 
Muendez, a coordinator for the Raza Awareness Week 
Committee. 

ThiS was Muendez's first year on the comnunce. The 
annual UC D Raza Awarene Week was started in 19 9 
by the Movimiento Estudianol Chicano de AztHn. 

"We are looking forward to all the great events," 
Muendez said. 

A visihle part of the May 5 kickoff event was a row of 
security guards wearing bright yellow shirts, composed 
mostly of members from an all-male club called Latinos 
Unidos con Hcrmandad y Ambicion, translated a 
"UllIted Laono with Brotherhood and Ambition." 

"We try to do as much community efYlce a we can," 
said Eliezer Mendoza , m charge of security and V1ce pres-
ident of L CI IA. "'vVe want to famJhanze with each 
mher, make friends and be a community."

Thurgood Marshall College is the only col-

garnering a respectable graduation speaker, 
the administration should seriously consider 
reinstating an all-campus commencement. 

Graduation is a very special time for all 
students. The graduation speaker is a large 
part of that experience_ With no disrespect 
to the student and faculty speakers that four 
of the five colleges have retained for this 
year's ceremony, tney simply do not have the 
same kind of appeal that a nationally recog-
niz.ed sp~aker would have_ It really makes 
the expenence more special and unique with 
someone who can draw an audience and cre-
ate a sense of pride in a university for getting 
such a good speaker. Additionally, it win 
leave graduates with a good last impression 
of UCSD, which might make them more 
likely to contribute money to the campus 
once they have gone out into the world and 
made some money. 

All-campus commencement was discon-
tinued last year after cancellations left the 
school without a viable speaker for the cere-
mony. This caused attendance to drop off. 
In fact, attendance has been poor for the 
past few years. However, that should not 
reflect as much on the viability of an all-
campus commencement as it should on the 
uncertainty of the speaker. 

UCSD has had a rich tradition of good 
graduation speakers who have drawn 
national attention. President Bill Clinton 
spoke at the ceremony in 1997 and was fol-

lo~ed . by then-House Speaker Newt 
GingrIch In 199 . It would be a big boost for 
the rep~tation of UCSD to get speakers of 
that callbe~ to speak at graduation . It would 
also be a bIg boost to the experience of the 
graduating students, who deserve such a 
speaker for such a special occasion.

The saga over UCSO's University 
Center expansion continues with 
more confusion, but with some 
improvement over past efforts.

MAKE MOM HAPPY THIS MOTHER1S DAY. 

San Diego's funding a fair decision 
Budget not as bleak as some would believe 
By CLAIRE J. VANNETTE 

Opinron Editor 

. When San Diego City Manager 
MIchael Uberuaga released the city'S 
fiscal year 2004 budget on May 5, the 
stack of papers in his hand lTl2y have 
been a little lighter than usual. 
Missing from the budget are some $30 
million in services that have been axed 
in the face of leaner-than-expected 
revenues. 

Though budget cuts are always hard 
to make and hard to cope with, San 
Diego should consider itself lucley. The 
cuts have been made with care and 
consideration, and the shortfall is 
slTl2Uer than it could have been, due to 
the continuing strength of our local 
economy. 

Many of the effects of the new 
budget cuts are quite minimal. The 
operating hours of libraries and 
recreation and community service 
centers will be reduced. It may take 
the city longer to respond to graffiti 
complaJOts. Some summer camp and 
youth activity programs may have to 
be discontinued. 

While all of this is a shame, It 'S 
exactly these SOrt of programs - the 
perks born of economic booms -
that should be the first to go in times 
of shortfall. It's also good news that 
the cuts have been spread more or les 
evenly around all of the city'S opera-
tions. It i better for all services to 
ex-perience a slight decrease than for 
certain areas, like police or fire 
departments, to take a big hit. 

There are certainly more dramatic 
repercussions of the shrinlang budget, 
Including over 100 layoffs and even 
more positions remairung unfilled JO a 
continua non of the hJring freeU! the

in demotions and lower pay, that's cer-
tainly better for work.ers than unem -

and S5.8 million [Q worker's compen-
saoon - hows how much the CIty 
values Its employees. Other agenCIes, 
such as the University of CalifornIa, 
have shown that not all who are cash-

strapped are wi lling to keep wages ris-
ing. 

San Diego has been immune to 
many of the ups and downs that have 
pl agued other areas of California. 
The presence of military installations, 
the defense industry, high-powered 
universities, well-established biotech-
nology companies and a tourism draw 
that JUSt won't quit has protected us 
from the dot-com bust and may in 
fact improve our standing while oth-
ers' economies stagnate. 

Perhaps the most heartening fact 
in Uberuaga's budget presentation 
was that revenues are actually increas-
ing in the city, JUSt not by as much as 
expected: Ordinarily, revenue would 
be expected to rise by $60 mi llion, 
and this year the increase was S10.5 
million - signi fica ntly lower but still 
an indication that the local economy 
is growing healthily. 

The picrure is much worse else-
where.In San Jose, Calif., for example. 
their local revenues have actually 
declined 17 .8 percent, according to the 
Sa" Frll"asco Chroniclt, and a a result, 
lawmakers have cut $77 million from 
the city's S42.5 billion budget and will 
raise city fee like recycilOg and 
garbage that could hit families for hun-
dreds of extra dollars a month. It i a 
ad irony that San Jose, once at the 

forefront of the tech boom that pro-
pelled California's late-1990's economy 
into the stratosphere, i now at the cen-
ter ofthe tech bust and can't afford tree 
trimming or road repaving. 

And of course there'~ California') 
state budget crisis. The multibIlli on-
dollar shortfall has prompted Gov. 
Gray Davis to authorize a $1.8 billion 
general fund bond, an unprecedented 
move, since such bond are typIcally 
only allocated through voter approval. 
A tax hike seem lOevitable, whether it 
comes now or later, (or even the 
Republican'S plans of talang out an

even larger $10 billion bond to 
prevent immediate tax hikes will 
need to be paid back somehow. 

State funding shortfalls will 
undoubtedly have an effect on the 
city's budget sooner or later. 
Uberuaga said reductions in funds 
the state generally allocates to 
cities and counties could be "very 
severe" and have a more dramatic 
effect on San Diego's 2004 budget. 
However, because our economy 
has remained relatively healthy, we 
may still avoid the shorrfalls seen 
in many other cities around the 
state. 

All in all, it's clear that San 
Diego is getting one of the 
mildest treatments in the state as 
far as financial shortfalls arc con-
cerned. Uberuaga's and Mayor 
Dick Murphy's intelligent cuts 
have put the city on stable foot-
ing.

TilE U 0 GUARDIAN OPINION S 

UCSD is once again gripped with fee fever 
University Centers expansion referendum is complex 
horse's 
mouth 

EdWu 

W ith the rainy season almost past us, the pri-mary incentive for 
expansion of the Price Center has 
nearly passed; after all , there are 
plenty of comfortable seats indoors 
and out when the sun is shining. Yet 
like one of those bowling pin -
shaped boxing balloons, UCSD 
srudents are voting on yet another 
attempt to expand the Price Center. 

Its almost become the "rite of 
spring" - an annual orgy of accu-
sations and counter-accusations 
(and post-election recriminations 
among the pro-expansion unholy 
alliance when the measures often 
fail) for a srudent fee referendtun. It 
would be quite entertaining (a lmost 
as entertaining as A.S. elections, 
perhaps) if only it did not actually 
have real world consequence: the 
checkbooks of U D srudents. 

The anti-referendum lrtcrarure 
(at http://wiJrUJ.sntdtntcontrol.org) 
makes for quite entertaining educa-
rion. lr almost reads like the BIble, 
even. And the Student Center 
begal the Price Center, which 
begat RlMAC, which begat the 
Price Center Expansion, and the 
sim of waste and gluttony of the 
original srudent fee referendum 
were pa ed onto Its off pnng. 

Despite the anti-administra-
tion rants though, the "no on 
expansion" page makes some 
rather convincing points agamst 
expansion: For all the money stu-
dents put into the (ostensibly) 
"srudent" center, why is it that tl1e 
bookstore occupies absurd 

amounts of space, and UCSD 
catering caters to everyone except 
UCSD undergraduates? And, why 
is it every time the University 
'Centers decide they need an 
expansion, they manage to get fab-
ulously expensive color glossy 
posters and full-color inserts into a 
certain srudent newspaper' If one 
is going to go begging, one sure as 
hell had better look poor. 

Yet despite the three previously 
fai led referenda for the expansion, 
one does have to admit that the 
often vehement

(with the exception of a rather 
vocal, and decently siU!d group). 
And maybe that is the ultimate les-
son of this entire exercise - even if 
the end results are such that sru-
dents end up paying for a catering 
service they do not use, an expan-
sive bookstore that eJrists largely to 
impress visitors and a srudent center 
less about food services than host-
ing conferences, the school as a 
whole still benefits, even if the 
undergraduates are being exploited.

the represcntaoves of the govern-
ment of that people - namely, the 

administrators - rather than hav-
ing any intrinsic rights in the sys-
tem. Rights and control over funds 
are given only insofar as it benefits 
the state of California. 

This is not, however, to say that 
griping or mobilizing is useless; 
after all, the referendum has much 
improved over the bloated mon-
strosity that was the last expansion 
proposal , largely due to srudent 
opposition. But one does have to 
realize that the rhetoric about sru-
dent control is all rather SI ll y; there 
IS no such thing, and there never 
will be because as undergraduates,

of expansion. The A.S. Internal 
Committee had also approved the 
resolution 9-0-1 . 

Committee members will join 
Grossman in duties such as over-
seeing polling booths throughout 
the week of voting. Any griev-
ances during the Special Elections 
will be heard by the A. . Elections 
Committee with Grossman pre-
siding. 

Additionally, any appeals to the 
committee's decisions will be 
addressed by the Campuswide 
Judicial Board. The current A.S. 
Election Bylaw pertaining specifi-
cally to special elections and cur-
rent Campus Policies will also be 
used as guidelines during the refer-
endum. 

"We need to make sure that the 
university or any other student 
governing body present materials 
without bias to try and get the 
opinion of the students," 
Gros man said prior to the coun-
cil passing the resolution. "It's 
important that students determine 
this election." 

The A.S. Council and the 
Graduate Student Association 
Council had initially appointed 
Grossman as elections manager and

fomled a new elections committee. 
However, GSA Council rescinded 
its approval of the bylaws, saying 
that it conflicted with its constitu-
tion, making the mechanics of the 
elections unclear. 

However, according to A.S. 
President Jeremy Paul Gallagher, It 
has been determined that the spe-

However, one of the many 
issues regarding the expansion fee 
referendum is whether the project 
itself was student-initiated and stu-
dent-controlled. 

According to a Vote No on the

by Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Joseph W. Watson four

that many student recommenda-
tions were ignored throughout the 
creation process of the referendum 
wording. 

"The student input toward the 
referendum is only circumsta n-
tial," said Jennifer Cohen, 3 core 
member of the Food Co-op and 
advocate for the VOle 0 cam-
paign . "There was no contract 
made until the building is com-
pleted and no contract on what 
will be done with the money." 

The Vote No campaign is com-
prised of people from the Food Co-
op and other interested students 
from various organizations.

Expansion Task Force Chair Garo 
Bournoutian refutes the claims that 
the referendum was initiated by the 
administration. According to 
Bournoutian, the task force charter 
to create the expansion referendum 
was drafted by former A.S. 
Presidents Jenn Brown and Jeff 
Dodge. He also states that the ref-
erendum is the result of student 
surveys. 

The task force is made up of 
student representatives from vari-
ous groups including A.S., ,reek, 
Student Affirmative Action 
Coalition and religious organiza-
tions. 

"As for this referendum 'not 
being student-initiated,' I would 
say that is a flat out lie aimed at 
mi informing voters," Bournoutian 
said. "Everyone on the task force 
truly believes this is omething stu-
dents want - we have worked on 
this project for over a year, all with-
out having been paid or given any 
other motivation." 

The referendum will ask Stu-
dents whether they support the $39 
per-quarter fee , which will be 
assessed for fall 2007, when the 
project is expected to be complet-
ed. Some of the features of the 
expansion for the Price Center 
include additional study ·lounges 
and 84 student organization offices 
and retail services, such as a full -
service bank and hair stylist. 
Expansion will also include a stu-
dent-run recruitment and retention 
center, which would place Student 
Affirmative Action Coalition orga-
nization offices adjacent to the 
Cross Cultural Center. 

Renovation for the Student 
Center includes the expansion of 
the General Store and of Soft 
Reserves and Lecture Notes . 
Student organization offices in the 
Student Center will also undergo 
renovations.

New parking plans receive approval 
Re-striping, temp. lots among solutions 
By CLAYTON WORFOLK 

Senior Staff Writer 

Months after announcing the 
Campus Planning Office!; project-
ed displacement of over 1,100 "S" 
parking spaces by April 2004, the 
Transportation Policy Committee 
issued its first set of formal recom-
mend a tions on April 25. 

The recommendations made to 
Vice Chancellor of Business Affairs 
Steven W. Relyea have since been 
approved by the campus and will be 
implemented, according to 
Transportation and Parlcing 

ervices Director Greg nee. 
Concl uding that the current 

parking supply will "barely meet 
demand" next year but will not in 
2004-05, the TPC recommended 
supplementing the Cityshuttle sys-
tem, completing construction of 
temporary east campus surface 
parking lots, re-striping parlcing 
tails and appointing a work group 

to address ways to equitably imple-
ment limitations on freshman resi-
dent parking for 2004-05. 

Restrictions on freshman resi -
dent parking will not be imposed 
next year since the campus parking 
demand is expected to be met 

"Even with the loss of 509 park-
ing spaces next year due to con-
struction, coupled with additional 
parlcing demand from increased 
student enrollment, the parlcing 
system should be able to accommo-
date demand [next year) if these 
surface lots are built and if addi-
tional faculty, staff and students uti-
lize the expanded Cityshuttle ser-
vice," Snee said. 

However, due to increasing 
campus enrollment and several 
campus construction projects that 
will displace current parking 
spaces, the TPC found that existing 
parking will not meet demand in 
2004-05 . 

"Because of this projection, 
measures such as the equitable 
implementation of limitations on 
freshman resident parking will be

"The situation has become 
worse," Kissler said. "According to 
the indications we have now, the 
governor will probably be releas-
ing estimates that are lower than 
the ones he had inJanuary." 

UC Director of Student 
Financial Support Kate Jeffery 
said that the university has taken 
action to secure extra financial 
help in light of an increase. 

"First and most important, UC 
will cover the full amount of the 
increase for grant-eligible stu-

Parking strike postponed 
following new report 

TPC decision not to restrict 
freshman parking considered 

By NEIL SPEARS 
Staff Writer 

A funding request for a student 
parking protest unveiled at the 
April 30 A.S. Council meeting was 
withdrawn following a favorable 
report from the Transportation 
Policy Committee. The planned 
May 14 protest has been POSt-
poned.

"It happened to work out to

the housing proJect was gone, that 
was half of our battle, right 
there. " 

In addition to the housing 
delay, the TPC has recommended

"Everything 
seemed to work 
out the way we to fight the admin-

istration and every-
thing it stands for," Bui said. "We 
wanted, as students, to have our 
voice heard." 

The protest was originally pro-
posed to take place on the morning 
of May 14 in Lot 412, near the 
Chancellor's office, to demand Wa 
concrete compensation or plan to 
deal with the displacement" of 
undergraduate "S" spots. 

According to Tom Chapman, 
the A.S. representative to the TPC, 
the decision to put the protest on 
hold came after the announcement 
that construction on the north 
campus housing project, which 
would have displaced 717 "S" park-
ing spaces and necessitated restric-
tions on freshman parking next 
year, will not begin until the 2004-

wanted it to, " Bui 
said. "The paved lots, the increased 
shuttle system and the delay in 
campus housing worked in our 
favor." 

In a May 6 letter to the I\.S. 
Council and college councils, the 
Parking Strike Force conceded that 
"it is not in the students' best inter-
est to continue with the demon-
stntion in light of the new devel-
opments." 

Although the protest will not 
take place as planned, the idea has 
not been completely abandoned by 
the strike force . 

"We're still going to be working 
behind the curtain," Bui said. 
"We're still going to be sending let-
ters to the chancellor and seeing 
how far this will go." 

Sun God: Festival will 
have two stages of music 

cOl'ltiru4td from />IJ«e I 
stage. Kinky, Bad Religion and 
Mos Def will follow their set. The 
second stage will be utilized 
between these sets where Beston 
and The Kitchen, Maxine and 
White Starr will play. 

"We're very excited," Krushner 
said. "We got some bands students 
already mow and love, and others 
that people will mow and love in 
the future." 

Considering all of the activities, 

Krushner said, "We feel like [Sun 
God) is more than just a concert, 
but an event. It's much bigger than 
Fall Fest or WinterFest. n 

Although he did not give an 
exact figure for the cost of this 
year's festival, Krushner remarked 
that it cost a lot, and that there was 
"no holding back."

Los Alamos: 
UC may lose 
students over 
contract loss 

continued from page I 
Both Leonard and Lynch, like 

other Los Alamos srudents, have sib-
lings who are either UC students or 
prospective ones. Lynch, whose 
older brother is a UCSD alumnus, 
said her 14-year-old sister's college 
decision might be affected should 
the University of California lose the 
contract. 

"If UC doesn't get the contract, 
she probably won't be able to con-
sider going to school Out here," she 
said. 

Edwina Lieb, who is coordinator 
of the Career Center and advise-
ment program at the 1,200 student 
Los Alamos High School - the 
only one in the city of 18,000 - said 
the loss of the UC contract would 
have a negative effect on the number 
of students who choose to attend 
UC campuses and is something that 
is of concern to parents of potential 
UC srudents. 

Lieb said that if the University of 
California loses the contract, she 
expects more students to look at 
smaller but comparably-ranked lib-
eral arts coUeges. 

"While parents are willing to 
stretch themselves, perhaps, for a 
Princeton, Harvard or Yale, they 
won't always do that for a Whionan 
or a Bowdoin necessarily," she said. 
"If the contract were to go away, the 
difference between out-of-state 
Nition and some of the smaller lib-
~ arts schools with a financial aid 
package might be pretty insignifi-
cant." 

Lieb said she knew of one snl-
dent last year who was tom between 
UCSD and Whionan College in 
Washington. The srudent ultimately 
chose UCSD, citing cost as a major 
factor. 

Los Alamos High School sends 
about 12 to 24 graduates each year 
to UC institutions from a sernor 
class of about 250, according to 
Lieb. About 75 percent of the high 
schools graduates go on to attend 
four-year institution and 10 percent 
go on to anend two-year insoru-
tions.

A.S. Buzz leaves you Strung Out 
Punk drenched in suburban boredom visits UCSD 

By JESSICA KRUSKAMP 
Senior Staff Writer 

What does Californi~ subur-bia, boredolll and a pen-chant for Bad Religion 
make? It creates the perfect concli-
tlOns for the 0 31 nco-punk 
tsunami that has drenched radio 
airwaves. IIowever, Strung Out, a 
band that grew out of such an envi -
ronment, has somehow managed to 
retain i[~ momentum and entice 
loyal followers with a stronger ren-
dillon of aliforma punk. 

Slrung lit I not so far out 
there that its label, Fat Wreck 
Chords, has 10 t the band. The 
musIc IS still in the Southern 

allforllla pop/punk ballpark, but 
Strung ut has beefier, more 
aggre Ive I1IU ie coupled With 
understandable melodle, whi h 
makes them a step or twO III front 
of today's pop/punk radiO leeche . 
-Inere always has to be a leader. 

Let's face it : The band formed 
111 1992; it actually went through 

the rite of pas age and did the 
world tour thing and now is making 
a naille for itself the good old-fash-
ioned way. Apparently a part of that 
passage includes a stopover at 
UC D on May 8 to hit the stage 
and put its music where the hype is. 

Strung Out's influences stretch 
all the way back to jazz, cia i rock, 
old school punk, metal and pop -
it i like one great big musical 
morgasbord, with ome pretty 

loyal followers . 
lnough it sounds like an urban 

legend, trUng ut has an energy 
that ha been known to whip lip even 
the tamest of crowds mto a frenzy. 
"Vhen the fivesomc walks onstage, 
concert-goers act a If, well, they 
were strung out and overly eXCited to 
hear a seenungly paradOXIcal blend 
of hosolity, Vigor and compassion. 

Lead singer and Iyrirlst Jason 
Cn17. forctbly engages the crowd, 
demanding anention through hi 
tage presence. Guitarists Jake Kiley 

anJ Rob Ramos arc way more than 
techn.ically proficient, they arc 

downright talented. Jordan Burns 
hanuners Out the drum rhythms, and 

hris Aiken I that qweter bass play-
er in the corner that is oh-so-cool. 

trung Out IS gearing up for a 
world tour and the U D show will 
be a nice prologue to catch. It will be 
sort of like a pecial insider glimp e 
at a l11uch bigger phen menon. The 
European leg of the tour begins May 
16 in the United Kingd 111, hits 

ustralia in July and then returns to

Surprise: 'Day Care' is not half bad 
Neurotic children and odd parents make the generic film good 

By NEHA SINGH 
Staff Writer 

W atchmg the trailer for "Daddy Daycare," you'd think that it was another 
ryPI al comedy with Eddie 
'\1urphy and genenc Jokes. After 
watchmg It, though, the film does-
n't seem half-bad. It doe have its 
low points, but surprisingly, it is a 
decent movie to entertain you 
after yet another consuming week 
at l1C D. 

Charlie (Eddie Murphy) and 
Phil Oeff Garhn) are so bu y with 
their high profile ad\'erosmg Jobs 
that they are completely missll1g 
Ollt on the JOYs of fatherhood. Due 
to some unfortunate accidents, 
however, their lads provide them 
With a cra.sh course m child rear-
mg with hilariou results. Garlin 
and Murphy introduce the stan-
dard, expected slapstick humor to 
the film that rarely makes you 
mile. The plot is slightly generic 

and even predictable from the 
minute the film starts. 

However, "Daddy Daycare" is 
worth watching, simply to ee 
what a neurotic bunch of children 
characters the writers can come up 
WIth. Each child is different, and 
every one is a challenge, whether 
he's suffering from a sugar rush, 
fantasizing about being a super 
hero or just demolishing every-
thing in Sight. Some of the more

psychotic kids play their parts so 
convincingly, you just can't help 
but wonder whether they draw 
some inspiration from daily life. 
Funnier still are the odd assort-
ment of parents, and the complete 
witch Anjelica Huston plays in the 
role of a snobby schoolmistress. If 
anything, this film acts as a safe-
sex banner. 

Overall, "Daddy Daycare" is a 
good movie to watch with your 
younger sibling or simply to 
entertain your elf without over-
working the brain . It is very 
lighthearted, but mostly just 
another comedy. It is expected to 

cater more to families; don't 
expect to see many UCSD stu-
dents in the audience. However, 
if you just have to watch the film, 
save it for a rental - it is hardly 
worth si tting next to noisy lads 
and their even noisier parents.

only truscworthy friend, the mind-

the "good one" who faithfully

comes in the form of Kaspar, 
another gross generalization, as 
the rich bitch who excessively rat-

Natascha McElhone (the 
haunting dead girl in both 
"Braveheart" and "Solaris") tries 
her best not to overdo her paper-
thin role as Sophie, a hippie-ish 
girl who tries to restore temples 
with her friends and makes time to 
have I1lghttime raves at the tem-
ples. The subplots of the love 
story and the temple restoration 
go a bsoluteiy nowhere and feel 
even more contrived than the rest 
of the film . 

Like the recent film "The Life 
of DaVid Gale," "City of Ghosts" 
unloads a few twists to ltven things 
up near the end. Unfortunately, 
also hke "David ale," this film is 
aimless and mediocre.

'Tattoo, A Love Story' is 
fun butlnot perlrlanent 

Big men and little ladies star in this little film 
with big appeal about love and tattoos 

By ANNE CONCi- HUYEN 
Associate Hiatus Editor 

A 30()..pound tattoo artist addicted to Doris Day movies and an uptight schoolteacher 
who hates children - this is not 
your average romantic comedy. It 
may sound strange, but oddly 
enough it works. "Tattoo, A Love 
Story," one of the first films in 
Madstone Theater's "Film Forward" 
series, tells the engaging story of 
these cwo polar oppo ites with a 
good deal of style and humor. 

Unlike many of the recent 
romantic comedies that try and pair 
up cwo mismatched singletons, 
"Tattoo" is a brave vision that 
breathes life into some very realis-
tic characters who 

" 

atypical yet relatable romance. 
"There are lots of tattooed !,ruys 

in the world, and they're not all 
lonely guys. 11,cre defini tcly is a 
match for everybody, and that's a 
challenge. 11,at's a romantic comedy 
I haven't seen. I've seen the beautiful 
people in New York who fall in love; 
I haven't seen JUSt nonnal people ... 
who have a story," Bean said. 

ewcomers Mignanelli and 
Edwards playoff each other nicely, 
portraying a relationship tI,at is 
believable, if not a little ru hed. 
Mignanelli perfectly puJls off the 
imposing tattooed sweetie with a soft 
side, giving his character a great deal 
of heart and humor. 

For Mignanelli, it wasn't difficult 
to play Virgil because his own life 

experience were 
very similar. acrually art differ-

ent, who have real 
problems and who 
don't make you 
want to gag. Their 
stark differences 
are clearly outlined 
cleverly and su btl y 
from the very 
beginning, they are 
also consistently 
carried through the 
film by a talented 
cast wi th grea t 
chemistry. 

There are lots of 
tattooed guys in the 
world and tl1ey're 

not all lonely guys," 

"It's not like it 
was a challenge for 
me. Because my real 
life ... really mimic-
ked a romantic 
comedy. The way I 
met, courted, swept 
my wife off her feet 
and slapped a ring 
on her finger. That 
was very much a 
comedy," he said. 

- Richard Bean. writer 
and cl"ndor of "Tattoo, A 

Love Story" As a stringen t 
teacher and control 

Sara Frost 
(Megan Edwards) is the beautiful, 
straight-laced elementary school 
teacher who is overwhelmed by the 
large, tattooed Virgil (Virgil 
Mignanelli) who invades her class-
room for show-and-tell. Despite 
their apparent differences, Sara's 
committed eight-year relationship 
with another man and Virgils alter-
native lifestyle, the cwo form a 
strange yet comfortable relationship 
that ends up scaring them and every-
one they know, but ultimately leads 
to a satisfying ending that, although 
predictable, distinguishes itself &om 
many other romantic-comedy end-
ings. 

Director Richard Beans goal in 
making this film was to depict an 

freak, Edwards 
shows a great deal of potential, 
although she is a little unnatural in 
the very dramatic or romantic 
scenes. But even so, she manages to 
remain a likeable character with 
understandable motivations. 

It is the supporting cast that is 
brilliant and makes this film a real 
comic gem. Divinely eclectic and 
strangely realistic, the unique per-
sonalities - &om the perpetually 
unconscious stoner Chris (Stitch 
Marker) to the nymphomaniac 
onJine dater roommate Jim 
(Benjamin Burdick) - add a great 
amount of humor and character to a 
film that may otherwise have been

THURSDAY, MAY 8, Z003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS II 

'Divine' laughs but little else 
New production of Dante's classic has great potential 

By JESSICA VACHAL 
Contributing Writer 

The second play in what promises to be an exciting season for the Lambs Players Theater, "A Divine Comedy," 
chronicle a newly hired pastor's attempts to 
integrate himself into St. Hilaria 's, the 
church that employed him. As Pastor Bob 
Shephard encounters the various members of 
his congregation, however, the immensity of 
this task becomes hilariously obvious. 

The strongest praises of the evening must 
go to Kathi Gibbs' portrayal of Ilellen 
Dalmnation, whose name is a spoof on the 
old sermons based upon hell and damnation. 
The assuredness and humor that Gibbs 
brings to her role creates the most lively 
character of the whole show. 

Following in Gibb's footsteps is Jelulifer 
Austin's portrayal of June, in which Austin 
takes a character that has no eccentricities or 
quirks and still makes her lively and seem 
wholly human. Indeed, Austin graces the 
audience asJune, acting as a poi ed and strong 
accent to the happenings on stage rather than 
conspicuously stealing the spotlight. 

Doren Elias' Karl Marx is another joy to 
watch. An ever-present member of the 
Lambs Players Resident Ensemble, Elias 
never disappoints witll his characterizations, 
and his portrayal of Marx is no exception. 
Acted with an over-the-top flair, Elias 
embraces the intentional tackiness of his 
character and plays it up as though each 
evening is his la st performance. 
Unfornmately, such a vivacity and presence is 
added to the stage during Elias' cenes that 
the other character with whom Marx inter-
acts are oftentimes over hadowed. 

Such a lack of characterization is wit-
nessed in Nick Cordi leone's portrayal of the 
lead role. Luckily for Cordi leone, being sur-
rounded by sllch a stellar cast keeps there 
from being any need for his lead character to 

do any more than propel the story along. 
While Cordi leone's Bob Shephard could be 
considered a well-rounded and well-thought 
out character, his portrayal of the role lacks 
any real distinction and is rather bland. 

Additionally, Paul Eggington's John 
Ripley ends lip being sadly one-dimensional. 
I-laving little enough elbow room as a sec-
ondary character, Eggingron docs nothing to 
add depth or life to his character. Due to this 
lack of enthusiasm, Ripley's presence lIpon 
the stage is occasionally so minimal that his 
importance to the story is questioned. 

Following the lead role's general lack of 
originality, and despite the general strength 
of the play's cast, the show's sets created by 
Mike Buckley are sorely lacking. Although 
Buckley'S sets do manage to caprure the basic 
feel of a church and later in the show, a park, 
their simplicity is too severe and they add 
nothing to the show. The sets are clearly only 
pieces against which the actors can act; they 
do not possess an existence of their own. 

Nathan Peirson's lighting follows suit in 
its lack of variation. Peirson's direction serves 
only to make the actors visible; it adds no 
emotion or life to the scenes and ends up 
only hurting the show. Jeanne Reith's cos-
tumes, on the other hand, present an aspect 
to each of the characters that can only be 
brought about visually. Reith 's slallful hand 
has created some truly memorable costumes 
that subtly work to cover the gaps left by the 
less pleasi ng aspects of the stage. 

Having so little to work with, "A Divine 
Comedy" falls squarely onto the shoulders of 
the actors. Luckily and despite some obvious 
flaws, this cast is able and capable of taking 
up such responsibility, and they do so with a 
grace tha t truly salvages the show. 

"A DIVIne Comedy" is currently playing at 
Lamb's Players Theatre through May 25. For 
more information call (619) 437-0600. 

Tattoo: Intense shot s are poetic 
continued fTom page 10 

simply enjoyable. 
For the most part, the film b well-written 

with strong characters and a well-developed 
plot. Even though the film is filled with many 
cliches, there are plenty of moment and small 
details that make it incredibly enjoyable. 

The intense shots of the tattooing process 
and the extreme close-up of a belly button 
piercing bring suspense and magic to a world 
that is often seen as eedy. The great cine-
matography turns this alternative and some-
times dark setting into a fun and oftentimes 
beautiful place. In addition, skillfully and 
cleverly shot nostalgic documentary-style 
pieces are interspersed throughout the film, 

givlI1g the audience a more personal perspec-
tive on ta noos. 

Although Ihis film may technically be a 
romantic comedy, it is one that will appeal to 
and please everyone, even those macho men 
out there who don't ee chick nicks.

THE U D GUARDIAN THURSDAY, MAY 8, Z003 

Lizzie McGuire: Her movie needs to fail 
The anti-feminist teen star now has her own film 

don't pop 
my sheep 

Anne Cong-huyen 

A II right, I won't deny it: I'm a dork. I watch the Disney Channel. But perhap ti,e most 
embarrassing of all i thaI I like "TI,e 
Lizzie McGuire how." 0 why i it 
that I want 0 hadly for 'The LiZZIe 
"Ie Ulre ,\10,~e" to faiP 

Maybe firM and foremost, 
because I'm a skepoc when II comes 
to TV shows that are made into 
films and vice ,er a. Thi hardly 
e,'cr works. \ Vhcn it tloes, though, it 
can he brilliant. But I'm pretty sure 
there aren't any geniuses at Disney 
who could pull off this one. Call me 
a disbeliever, but II just won't work. 

The thing that disturbs me mo t 
about thIS movie IS that the very 
beSt character III the show, Miranda 
(played by IS-year-old 
singer/son~\Ttter/actress Lalaine), 
won't be appearing in the film. OK, 
1 probably sound like a freaki hly 
obsessed preteen "Lizzie 1cGuire" 
fan, but in ali actuality, Miranda is 
the only character on the how who 
shows any amount of individuality 
and determination (be ides perhaps 
maybe Gordo) that doesn't bug the 
hell out of me. Miranda doesn't 
care who the most popular girl in 
school is or how others perceive the 
way she dresses. he doe n't try to 
please everyone and mo t impor-
tandy, he' not as stupid as Lizzie. 

That sounds harsh, but I really 
can't stand the main character. 
Lizzie McGuire (I'Hllary Duff) is 
the hormonal 14-year-old who 
spend her days chasing after 
dimwitted cuties and trying not to 
make a fool of herself in front of 
the cool girl . The show does a 
great job of bringing up important 
topics for adolescents like friend-
ship, rivalry, honesty, first loves 
and, of course, first bras, through 
the eyes of thrce teens who don't 
exactly fit in, and Duff does a 
decem job of bringmg some rcalis-
tic humor to the show. 

" Miranda doe n't 
try to please everyone 
and most importantly, 
she's not as stupid as 

Lizzie, " 
Ilowever, if it weren't for the 

excellent cast of eclecttc friends and 
family, including the funny hipster 
Miranda, the silly jewish filmmaker 
kid Gordo (Adam Lamberg) and 
Robert Carradine (of "Revenge of 
the Nerds" fame) as the father, this 
show would never work. 
Ridiculou Iy pretty, Duff ends up 
playing an absurdly shallow girl 
interested mo tly in clothes, make-
up and boys. he can be channing 
and self-deprecati ng at times, but 
for the most part, she's JUSt really 
annoying. 

In the end, the character of 
Lizzie is highly anti-femilllst, and 
this type of exaggerated comedy 
may work on telc,;sion, but I'm 
doubtful it will fly on the big screen. 

o why do I even bother watching 
this show, when I dishke the title 
character so much? It's all Miranda. 

Miranda is tJ,e character who is 
uncompromising, sometimes stub-
born and will speak her mind. \Vhile 
Lizzie is cowering behind the per-
fect. popular girl Kate (Ash lie 
BriUault), Miranda will get in her face 
and argue with her lIsing the perfcct 
amount of teenage flair. She~ the hrirl 
who \\~II grab a guy and say "I refu c 
to be the wallflower" not constramed 
by social conventions that are so 
important to L,uie. It's this type of 
independencc and resolve that is 

lnis.~ing from so many fClllale charac-
ters on television and film. 

Additionally, shes the principal 
Asian character, and what'. so 
rcfreshing is that she isn't depicted as 
bemg a dorky egghead or a submis-
sive female. Instead, he has charac-
ter, drive and a distinctive pe.rs nali-
ty lacking from many female charac-
ter fow,d in youth programming. 

So why i n't dus primary charac-
ter (she's one of liZZie's two closest 
friends) not in the movie? Who 
knows? Rumor are circulating 
about another movie she was film-
ing, an album she's recording and 
even a reported rivalry between the 
two female leads. Either way, Lalaine 
will nor be in the "Lizzie" movie, 
even at their eighth grade graduation 
at the beginning of the film.

Rumors: Whatever happened to Miranda? 
continued from page 12 

Instead, the stOry focuses on 
LiZZIe as she goes to Rome for her 
class trip where she meers and falls 
in love with a teenage Italian singer 
who turns her into a beautiful pop 
star. But the fun i threatened when 
her parenrs find out and the entire 
family flies to Rome. 

My first reaction upon hearing 
this plot, like that of many rational 
individuals was, "What the hell?" 

FI rstly, what type of public 
school would arrange for eighth 
graders to go on a class trip to 
Italy? Some schools might offer a 
trip to \,vashington, D .C., but 
Europe? And ['m ure it' incredi-

bly easy to meet a huge pop star in 
Europe who wi ll offer to give you a 
makeover and make you an interna-
tionally recognized singer. And of 
course lors of families can affo rd to 
drop everything and fly to Europe 
in order to discipline a teenager 
without a thought to re ponsibili-
ties or finallcial difficulty. Right. 

These may eem like minor 
details in the perfect world of Disney 
and Hollywood, but are incredibly 
important in the real world. These 
types of unrealistic depiction can 
everely skew the perceptions of the 

impressionable young who may idol-
ize Lizzie McGuire (please cd 
nol), and that is really scary. 

How many mode rn day 
Cinderella stories will Disney try 
and cash in on? And why are we 
all falling fo r them? I mean I love 
a grea t romance JUSt like the next 
girl, and J'm a sucker for fairy 
tales, but there's a point when they 
become so commercialized and 
drained of any true value that it 
becomes a frightening spectacle. 
So if this movie makes it, if it 
becomes a top grossing film for 
even a couple of weekends (I'll let 
the first one slide), I shall be 
incredibly disappointed . And you 
can be pretty sure that you WOll ' t 
be seeing me at "The LiZZie 
McGuire Movie." 

Finally there's a movie for book lovers 
The director and star of JlStone Reader" spills about life and books 

By ANNE CONG-HUYEN 
Associate Hiatus Editor 

Television, movies and Internet seemed to have replaced books in our culture, but filmmaker 
Mark Mo kowitz, in his film 
"StOne Reader," skillfully breathes 
life into the literary culture that 
seemed all but dead. 

In 1977, at the age of 18, 
Moskowitz was compelled to buy 
"The Stones of Summer" by the 
unknown writer Dow Mossman 
after he read irs praise in a Nrw York 
Trmes book review. Some 25 years 
later, he actually got around to read-
ing it and it affected his life so much 
that he w.IS driven to search for the 
mysterious author who vanished 
after irs publication, thus ini tiating 
what would eventually become a 
brilliantly crafted film about the pas-
sion, madness and reality in the liter-
aryworld. 

With beautiful, if amateurish, 
cinematography and an ingenious 
structure, "Stone Reader" pulls the 
audience into Moskowitz's obses-
sive world as they gladly tag along 
for this exciting journey o f emo-
tional and in tellectual diM:overy. By 
the end of it, you'll ei ther be 
inspired to devote yourself to writ-
ing or to read this book or one of 
the numerous others listed. 

In his own words, M oskowitz 
speaks of his motivations and inten-
tions in making this film. 

GtumJiIm: You were an English 
major, so how did you get in to film? 

Mark Moskowitz.: I fell into 
the filmmaking business completc-

Iy by accident. I went to work for 
this company in Philadelphia mak-
ing $25 a week sweeping out the 
studio on Saturdays. The rest of the 
week I hung around the studio and 
worked for nothing. We made 
mdustrial films and bad TV com-
mercials and I learned the business 
and loved it . I just stayed and ,vith-
in a couple of year . my wife was 
working and supporting us, and I 
learned to produce, direct, the 
camera work, the trade and it took 
off from there. I just followed my 
heart and did what I wanted to do. 
I was never financially motivated; I 
just kept wanting to make what I 
kept wanting to make. That's the 
key to success in the arts, maybe in 
life: Do what you want to do and 
you'll succeed at it. And if you suc-
ceed at it, financial security wi ll 
come as a byproduct. 

G : You ay you aren't a writer, but 
you have great storytelling ability 
which you can see by watching the 
movie. You could have made it really 
boring. 

MM: Yeah I could have. It 's 
amazing it 's not. I used every trick 
in the book to try and keep you 
going. I think that's the fun part 
about writing a novel. Think about 
it, when you write a novel , you 
don't know where the story's going. 
You don't know what the characters 
are gonna do. That's the fun of it. 
In filmmaking, that can only come 
from nonfiction worle. In a fiction 
film , it 's all scripted and organized; 
the surprises are out. A lot of din~c­
tors will tell you that shooting the 
film is the worst part. There is no 

discovery. It's just execution. 

G: Was it incredibly frustrating, 
as you were making your fi lm, real-
izing that no one knew who this 
guy was? 

MM: Yeah. Yeah, it was ~errible 
because all I wanted to do was con-
nect about the book. I wanted some-
one to say UOh! You read that 
book?" You know when you read a 
good book. That's why I went to 
Maine to seeJohn Sealy. It was great. 
Here was a guy 30 years my senior 
from a different time and a different 
place and we could talk like we real-
ly knew each other within hours. 

G: How was it for you when you 
went to visit Bill M urray [the 
reti red writing professor] and you 
asked him about the one person he 
had helped along, and he men-
tioned "The Stones of Summer" 
and Dow Mossman? 

MM: I was blown away. I was 
speechless. A lo t of people say "You 
didn 't react." I w.IS stunned. The 
classmates didn't remember him. I 
didn't think the professor would 
remember him. So I thought let's 
get this guy ulking and then we'll 
ease him into it and then I'D drag 
out the book. So when he just brings 
it out I didn't know what to do. He 
was a real guy. I htuJ to go find the 
guy .. . The fascinating thing, as you 
watch the movie, is that all the clues 
are there in the movie.

Crew: Filippone pleased 
with team's performance 

continued from page :lO 
on the team, the boat was stroked 
by freshman Enc Kuhle. followed 
by Scott Destafney, Dan Toth, Leo 
Shook, and coxed by Shannon 
Oliver. The boat won the finals 
with a time of 6:34.4, six seconds 
ahead of second place fi nisher 
SDSU. which had defeated the 
Tritons earlier in the season. 

"It was great to see a varsity 
boat come out on top," Filippone 
said. 

All three novice boats came 
back to San Diego with bronze 
medals. The novice lightweight 
four finished the race with a time of 
7: 16.2, only nine seconds behind 
the winner Cal Lights. beating 
both UC Santa Barbara and UC 
Davis. 

The second novice eight came 
in third with a time of 6:39.7, 
behind close rival Orange Coast 
College, but beating the Aztecs by 
over 30 seconds. 

Only 10 seconds behind leader 
Orange Coast College. the first 
UCSD novice eight boat was able 
to overcome UC Irvine in a close 
finish with a time of 6:20.7. 

"It would have been nice to win 
the novice races. but it is nice to see 
solid and consistent performances 
by all three boats. It is a great sign 
of the future of our program," 
Filippone said. 

The Triton varsity crew came 
away from the weekend demon-

Strating that it has the speed to 
compete at the championship level 
with a solid performance in the 
varsity eight and a win in the varsi-
ty four. 

"It is great to prove that we 
could overcome the problems in 
the middle of the season. Our rac-
ing ability this weekend shows all 
that we have accomplished in the 
season," Filippone said . 

The varsity eight came in third 
in the petite final with a time of 
6:22 .6, behind only USD and 
University of Puget Sound. The 
Tritons were able to beat both 
Irvine and SDSU, teams that had 
been a challenge in the weeks lead-
ing up to WlRA Finals. 

"The success of the varsity eight 
just shows that by sticlcing with the 
same lineup, we have the ability get 
good speed and be competitive at 
the end of the season when it 
counts," Filippone said. 

Overall , the solid performances 
by all UCSD boats at the WIRA 
Finals showed that the Triton men 
had the ability to overcome 
injuries and disappointing races, 
and find the speed to be top com-
petitors. 

"The results of the weekend 
were great. but most of aU, it was 
good to see a bunch of kids out 
rowing. It showed the competitive 
and high quality athletes in the 
program and the enjoyment they 
get from the sport," Filippone said.

FAQ on REEF FinanCing 
Qlestton: Haw .. EdlCltlal 11IY ..... 1ItI dltfnllt frIIIll .. l? 

Answer: Loans are sums of money lent at interesL Education Investments 
are sums of money disbursed to students at no interest. The 
obligation of an Education Investment is based on a fixed percentage 
of future income for a fIXed period of time. This program allows 
flexibility in obligation according to your economic situation. 
Which means, you pay less when you have less and more when you 
have more. 

question: can these Eucatlo. IIVlSblents par far III af lIlY tultlan? 
Answer: Education Investments are a great complement for students that 

have already received grants, scholarships and federal loans, but 
still need more money for their living costs. REEF can help students 
fill the gap between what you have and what you need. REEF will 
fund a maximum of $7000 for cost of living expenses per school 
year. 

Questlan: Haw dill tills Ifftct .., Flllllcill Aid pacUge? 
Answer: Education Investments will not affect your Financial Aid package. 

REEF works closely with the Financial Aid Office and the Student 
Business Office at UCSD to ensure Education Investment 
disbursements fit into your cost of living package. As opposed to 
increasing the amount of loans you are responsible for, you now 
have an alternative way to finance your education that's more 
sensitive to your future ability to pay. 

Question: Now ... tIIese percentage mes det_lled? Will tIIey chlnge 
throughout to life of tilt obU,ltlon? 

Answer: Percentage rates begin: 
0.1% for graduate students (1110 of one percent) 
0.2% for undergraduate students (1/5 of one percent) 

$2 off 
$1 off An,Medlum Pizza 

Rates are specific to each applicant. Education Investments are 
awarded on a case-by-case basis. The more information a student 
gives REEF, the more accurately a rate is determined. Students are 
encouraged to infonn REEF about their goals, career plans, internships, 
major, test scores, CPA and anything else they think is relevant 
regarding their future.

Women's crew: Varsity four takes fourth Club Sports: Dancesport 
to host "A Day in Paradise" continued from page 20 

"It was a deeply disappointing 
race, as we lost to crews that we 
had beaten before, and we lost by 
a big margin." 

Captain Sara Patton was sick 
and had to be replaced by 
Hopkins. Smalley competed, but 
became sick shortly thereafter. 

"I'm sure there was ome effect 
there," Pinkerton said, referring 
to the disappointing fintsh . "But 
frankly, neither one of those 111-
nes e would have accounted for 
the huge change in boat speed. 
The crew itself just did not extend 
itself when it needed to. As a 
result, we have lipped badly in 
the rankings, and I will be con-
templating wholesale changes in 
the lineups." 

The econd varsity eight boat 
finished at 14th place. Anne 
Roddy, Kornfield, Moruca Miller, 
Joyce Chang, Kaelberer, Record, 
Bryn Moser, Lauren Cooper and 
coxswain Romelfanger represent-
ed UC D in this race. 

The varsity four finished in 
fourth place. UCSD's boat includ-
ed coxswam Romelfanger, Jen 
Watters, Amanda hirley, Record 
and LIz Jones. 

"Everything came together thiS 
weekend," ~aid Moser, member of 
the no\~ce four and second varSI ty 
eight. "All the hard work and ded-
Ication we've put in tim year paid 
off, and lust watching our boats

"Everyone worked a one and 
we accomplished more then any 
novice squad before us. I feel we 
walked away with more than just 
medals, H Davis said. 

The coach agreed. 
"It was an outstandmg perfor-

mance for the athletes, and the best 
finish of a novice eight in memo-
ry," Pinkerton said. "They raced 
against 22 scholar hip schools, and 
beat all but one of them."

"Da\1S was ahead in the begm-

dred meters, the girl pulled 
together and decided to gIVe Davis 
a real race," Pdram said. "ShOWing 
the same effort and more from the 
City champion hip race a few 
weeks ago, the girls began to 'walk

The boat finished in first place, 
making the team both champions 
and one of the most successful 
novice teams in UCSD history. 

"All of us were so happy at the 
end of the race and hearing the 
crowds, and our teammates cheer-
ing for us told u they were fee ling 
the same things we were," Grace-
Bishop said. 

Pinkerton, who had high hopes 
for this boat, echoes congratula-
tions for this race. 

"The second novice eight won 
their race tn fine fashion by open 
water [by more than a boat length) 
beating C Davis, currently the 
top D-II school in the nation, 0 
they de erve full marks for an out-

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

CLUB SPORTS 

UCSD was set to take on 
Illinois on May 3 to ee who would 
advance to the finals on the follow-
ing day. Illinois dominated the 
~ame from the beginning, scorIng 
ItS first try two minutes into the 
first ha lf. Illinois jumped back Onto 
the board ar the four-minute mark 
with another try, putting the score 
at 12-0. 

UCSD answered with its first 
try in the 19th minute, with 
Maggie Low scoring the try and 
Kirsren Ilarto kick.ing for the con-
ver ion. UCSD then scored on a 
penalty kick by Ilarros eight min-
utes later. However, Illinois domi-
nated the rest of the fir t half, scor-
1l1g on trIes by Rachel McArthur 
and Mandy Moore and a conver-
sion kick by Lauren Weber. The 
first half ended with UC D trading 
by a score of 24-10.

lIIinoi~ backs outpaced UCSD 
111 the second half, keeping their 
field po iuon throughout the 40 
minutes. Illinois cored another try 
111 the fir t five mInute of play but 
missed the conversion. U D gor 
on the board again in the lOth 
minute of the half with a try by 
Marea Blue, but the team also 
missed its conversion. Illinois 
qwckly answered back at the 14-
minute mark with a penalty kick 
and another try in the 16th minute. 

ix minutes later, Illinois scored 

again with another try, but mis ed 
the conver ion . 

UCSD came back to score a try 
by Jdlian Duggan, but Illinois 
responded with a try of its olVn at 
the 30-minute mark, also luckmg 
for the conversion . With five mlll -
utes of play remalnll1g, Ill inois 
scored the fi nal try of the match, 
endi ng UC D 's hopes for a nation-
al title with a final score of 56-20. 

The Tntons were disappointed 
but stayed around to play the con-
solation match agatn t playoff vet-
eran Penn State on May 4. 

UCSD started very well with 
some hard-hitting rucks and Its 
pressure led to a core in the sev-
enth minute by outside center 
Jessica Vennlri, who broke arollnd 
the outside to score in the corner. 

At mid-half, Penn State's serum 
began to take control and with that 
good source of possesSIon, the team 
managed to put a sene of trong

runs in the forwards and finall y 
broke the UCSD tryline, gomg 
over for the score and converttng 
to tiC the game 7-7 . Penn State got 
one more score before the end of 
the half, and UC D went into half-
ttme trailing 14-7. 

UCSD again started trongly 
and managed to pressure the Penn 
State rucks. But the team's inability 
to win its own scrums put U SD 
on ItS back foot for much of the 
half. Late in the half, UCSD man-
aged to steal a Penn State lineout 
and score a try. Hartos missed the 
converSIOn, however, and Penn 

tate rematned on top with a score 
of 14-12, With JUSt eight tnmutes 
left. 

Penn tate shoved the UCSD 
pack back over the line just long 
enough to core once more, and 
despIte some late runs by UCSD, 
Penn State held on to win 19- 12 to 
secure third place, dropping 

UCSD to fourth in the nation. 
AIr Force went on to win both 

the ,\.1 en'~ and Women's DiviSIOn I 
Collegiate Championship, an 
unprecedented achievement for its 
program. 

WOMEN'S ULTIMATE 
The UCSD women's ultimate 

team WIll advance to the Ultimate

regional championships this past 
weekend . UCSD went 6-0 on the

UC anta Barbara, Claremont, 
Arizona and Colorado. 

Most of the teams did not put 
up much of a fight against UCSD, 
which defeated Santa Barbara 15-4 
and shut out CSU \5-0 . Colorado, 
which came in second in the 

SI'ClRT 19 

Regional tournament, provided the 
only real competition for UCSD, 
which still won 15- 12.

A fantasy 

sports geek 
makes his 
confession 

o Knows 
Owen Main 

T he first step to recovery is admitting you have a prob-lem. And I admit it. I'm a 
fantasy sports geek. It doesn 't matter 
what sport: baseball, basketball, foot-
ball or others. I play them all With 
the fervor of a general manager. 

Between two jobs and school, I 
find orne to spend checkmg on my 
team, trying to make a key trade, 
or writing po ts in my league to 
the morons who think that Allen 
Iver on is the best player in the 

BA and think that they can trade 
me some guy who's going on the 
disabled list for Albert PujoIs. 

Even with my daily habit, I'm 
definitely not at the same level as 
certain other nameless Individuals at 
the GUIl'7'IJian. I don't always have 
time to go to sites like 
htrp:I/www.whonftports.cum, where I 
could draft my own team from every 
player of all time in each sport and 
then playa hypothetical season. But 
if I did, I'd be there in a heartbeat, 
throwing down $9.95 per fantasy 
season to play my all-time Dodgers 
against anybody in the Internet 
world. 

For now, I'll sock to the regular 
fantasy sports, where checking my 
team and other people's teams dally 
IS not only part of the game, but 

mcrease~ my sportS knowledge. 
ome would say that fantasy 

leagues take away from the game: 
that they make a fan begm to care 
more about indiVidual statistics 
then how his team does. Case in 
point: Yesterday - when Tom 
Glavlne, one of my pitchers, faced 
my favorite team - the Dodgers. 
Wa I to root for my team or for 
Glavine? The answer is ... I went 
ahead and rooted for the Dodgers 
to wm 1-0. 

Fantasy sports may create some 
conflicts of Interest, but I think 
they create more interest and, in 
my opinion, the more interest in 
sportS, the better. Do you know 
who Mike MacDougal IS? If you're 
a fantasy baseball "manager," then 
you probably know that he's lead-
Ing the American League in saves 
(as of May 6 With a total of 10), a 
very Important stao~ttc and the 
one that has been keeping me from 
clJlllbmg frOIl1 fourth place to my 
rightful 'POl alOp both of the 
league, I'm In 

Other people IllIght ,ay that If 
you do fmasy )pons. you're a geek 
or some lund of ~oclal misfit. 
Maybe thiS was once true, but Jt~ 
not anymore. Fantasy )ports have 
Invaded even the coolest of CIrcle •. 

Fan~)' sports give people who 
think they know something about 
sportS a chance to prove that they 
know more than others. In essence, 
it's much like gambling on a game, 
but what you're gambling is more 
your reputation as a complete porn 
fan, not money. As if I needed It, 
fantasy ports gives me one more 
reason to pay anention to what 'S 
gOing on, and that could never be a 
bad thing.

being down 2-1 after doubles 
forced them to play even tougher," 
said UCSD head coach Liz

was our goal, since we had beaten 
them last year in the same round. 
They had a few new girls at the
