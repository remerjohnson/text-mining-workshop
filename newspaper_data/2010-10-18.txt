Botswana and Tanzania are two new destinations now 
available to students looking to study abroad through the 
University of California Education Abroad Program.

According to EAP Director Jinous Kasravi, these programs 
were added to increase diversity to the program. Before, Africa 
was underrepresented with only three countries — Ghana, 
Egypt and South Africa — available.

“[We would like to] move more programs to less traditional 
locations,” Programs Abroad Advisor Maribeth Erlich said. 
“It’s such a unique opportunity for EAP students or any UCSD 
student.”

Kasravi said the programs in other African countries do not 
conflict with each other and all have different ranges of focus. 

Botswana and Tanzania were chosen, according to Kasravi, 
because of a recommendation from the UC faculty advisory 

committee. 
In May, the University Committee of International 

Education passed the proposal for a pilot program affiliation 
with the Council on International Educational Exchange, 
which already administers the program.

According to UCEAP Director Michael Cowan in the May 
meeting minutes, the fees for enrolling in EAP would be less 
expensive compared to the CIEE program because CIEEoffers 
a discount to UCEAP.

“The goal is to increase the numbers of students studying 
abroad in Africa and these are great programs providing an 
introductory experience,” Kasravi said in an e-mail.

For the 18-week Botswana program, offered only in the fall, 
students study at the University of Botswana. The university 
is located in the capital city of Gaborone, where students can 
learn about Botswana’s role in the Southern Africa region.

Programs available in Botswana — which are taught in 
English, its official language — include biological sciences, 

business, education, engineering, film and media studies and 
political science.

“The ideal students for these programs are those who are 
interested in African studies, development studies, public 
[and] global health, African language and literature and ser-
vice learning [or] internships,” Kasravi said. “Botswana offers 
opportunities for students to enroll directly in a variety of 
other academic disciplines as well.”

In addition, there is a public and environmental health pro-
gram called Public Health Track, which focuses on the AIDS 
epidemic in Bostwana, where nearly 40 percent of adults have 
the disease, according to an Africa Renewal report by United 
Nations. The University of Botswana is home to the Centre 
for the Study of HIV/AIDS, which is a key part of the public 
health program.

Five service workers visited Chancellor Marye Anne Fox’s 
office on Oct. 14 in response to UC Board of Regents’ September 
pension reform proposals, which increased the amount the UC 
system and its employees contribute to the UC Retirement Plan 
and suggest reducing the University of California’s share of 
retiree health insurance premiums and pension benefits for new 

employees hired 
after July 2013.

Along with 
workers in seven 
other UC campus-
es in the statewide 
action, workers 
held enlarged 
checks reading 
“Pay to the Order 
of UC Executives: 
$180,000” that 
were “void due to 
inequity,” signed 

by UC President Mark Yudof.  
“We wanted to give a message to President Yudof that as fees 

increase retirement income for top executives, he’s cutting low-
wage workers,” lead organizer Matias Marin said.

The workers asked the Chancellor to deliver the message and 
the enlarged check at the next Regents’ meeting on Nov. 16 to 
UC President Mark G. Yudof.

“The chancellor wasn’t there but we left a message. She is usually 
good at delivering the message,” Marin said. “Our hope is that she  
delivers the check with the specified amount  
of money that [Yudof] is giving himself as a retirement and that 
we as the UC community are voiding that check because it’s 
immoral.”

Currently, 2 percent of employee earnings and 4 percent of 
employer earnings are directed to the retirement plan. 

In the proposals adopted on Sept. 16, employees will contrib-
ute 3.5 percent of their salary to the retirement plan — which 
includes pension and retiree health benefits — beginning July 
2011 while the UC system will contribute 6 percent. 

Starting July 2012, Employee contributions will then increase 
to 7 percent while the UC system will pay 10 percent

Over 5,600 attendees gathered for the annual FallFest concert, which featuredperformanc-es from Big Boi, Mutemath and N.A.S.A. at 
the Warren Field.

This number is about 1,000 fewer attendees 
than last year, when a record-breaking 6,300 attend-
ees were at the event. A.S. Concerts and Events 
Marketing Director Willa Lim said this is the second 
largest turnout for the festival.

N.A.S.A. opened with a deejay set to get almost 
non-existent crowd. People started trickling in as 
rockers Mutemath took the stage. 

Waves of approval came from the crowd as lead 
singer Paul Meany climbed and jumped off a stage 
scaffold.

According to Associate Vice President of Concerts 
and Events Brian Wong, the extended periods of 
silence between sets was one of the major complaints 
coming from last year’s concert. 

This performance from Big Boi comes 3 months 
after the release of his solo debut CD Sir Luscious Left 
Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty was released. Although 
his set consisted mostly of songs off of this album, he 
played some Outkast classics such as “ATLiens.”

“I thought Big Boi was more current,” Wong said. 
“Students felt a better connection with him.”

According to both Wong and Lim, the night 
went very smoothly with few small alcohol-related 
citations.

“The only con I have was that it was a little bit 
misty outside,” Wong said. “Other than that it was 
superb.”

A.S.’ executive budget for this event was $153,000, 
in comparison to last year’s $90,000.

FiveÊHoursÊSleepÊEnoughÊforÊaÊLongerÊLifeÊ

Students worried about not get-
ting the recommended 8 hours of 
sleep before their next-day mid-
term can now relax, the common 
idea that 8 hours of sleep nightly 
is necessary for health may not be 
true. Psychiatry professor Daniel 
F. Kripke led a study that found 
women who sleep between 5 and 6.5 
hours are more likely to live longer. 

In its research, the team followed 
up on a study first conducted from 
1995 to 1999 to determine if there is 
a correlation between sleep duration 
and mortality rates. The research-
ers used a wrist activity monitor to 
measure the sleep duration of 444 
women, age 50 to 81, living in San 
Diego.

Kripke’s team analyzed the find-
ings this year to examine the women 
who were still alive after 14 years. 
Of the original participants, 358 
were located and of 209 women who 
slept, on average, between 5 and 6.5 

hours had the highest survival rates, 
while the 101 women who slept 6.5 
or more hours had the second high-
est survival rates.

The 43 women who slept less 
than 5 hours were most likely to 
suffer from fatal health issues. The 
other 86 women had died and the 
group did not have information on 
the causes of death.

“[Women who are] ver age 
60 do not have to worry about 
sleep apnea — the suspension of 
external breathing — either, in 
terms of survival,” Kripke said. 
This information confirms other 
studies on sleep, which have found 
that self-reported sleep durations 
shorter than 6.5 hours or longer 
than 7.5 hours are associated with 
increased mortality risk.

Kripke’s study also found the 
number of hours associated with 
a low-mortality risk. In addition, 
the team found that high melatonin 
— also known as the “hormone of 
darkness” because it is secreted both 
in day and night — is also related to 

high mortality.
“[It] is interesting because it 

tends to disprove the idea a lot of 
people have that melatonin supple-
mentation is good,” Kripke said.

Though the study was only con-
ducted on women, Kripke said it 
would be worthy to conduct a men’s 
sleep study as well. In previous stud-
ies on sleep duration, the results 
have been very similar for men and 
women.

The reform plan, put together by 
the UC Post-Employment Benefit 
Task Force, is an attempt to reduce 
the program’s $14 billion funding 
deficit. 

At the latest Board of Regents 
meeting, a pension panel discussed 
recommendations to the plan and 
several alternative solutions were 
proposed — for example, retire-
ment income could be maintained 
or increased for employees who 
earn $180,000 or above, while 
low-wage workers would receive a 
decreased income.

The Board of Regents will dis-
cuss a final plan together and vote 
in December.

According to Marin, this plan 
would cut low-wage workers’ retire-
ment by 50 percent. 

In addition, Marin said the UC 
system promised to pay 60 percent 
of the pensions 20 years ago but is 
currently paying 4 percent.

According to a report in the 
plan, due to a 20-year funding sur-
plus neither UC nor its employees 
needed to contribute toward the 
cost of pension benefits. 

“Instead of giving fee increas-
es to executives, they should stop 
cutting worker retirement, worker 

wages and also stop increasing fees 
for students,” Marin said. “The cuts 
that UC executives are proposing 

hurt our econ-
omy because 
if workers 
don’t have 
a dignified 
r e t i r e m e n t 
when they 
retire, they’re 
going to be 
using taxpay-
ers’ dollars in 
health care. 
When they 
get old, the 
community is 
going to have 
to pay for 
them instead 
of the UC 
giving them 
a dignified, 
fair and just 
retirement.”

Marin and the workers are part 
of American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Employees, 
which is a statewide union made 
up of 20,000 UC service and patient 
care workers like custodians, 
groundskeepers, shuttle drivers and 

radiologic technicians. 
At UCSD alone, there are 3,000 

workers in the union.
“It was a very small delegation,” 

Marin said. “It was just to deliver 
the message very quick.”

Chancellor Fox could not be 
reached for comment.

You surprised me. With all the shiny little gadgets within reach of your eager fingers, 
why could you possibly want to read 
something as archaic as a newspaper? 
Oh, I get it. You’re probably sitting on 
the bus trying to avoid eye contact 
with the person sitting across from 
you — that’s not awkward at all. So, 
stick your face in this newspaper and 

make it look like you’re busy.
Now, I’m not some technology 

Nazi. I know that not all of us are 
social butterflies and I do know that 
we need our phones, but phones, 
iPods and computers shouldn’t domi-
nate our social interactions. They’re 
crutches, helping us with the insecuri-
ties of dealing with others.

As Apple continues churning 
out cooler and cooler versions of the 
iPhone and Skype and Facetime make 
remote communication even easier, 
we’re losing our ability to socialize in 
person. As etiquette expert Jacqueline 
Whitmore so poignantly put it, “Some 
people think this technology can 
make us more productive. But it’s not 
helping us with social skills. It’s alien-
ating us from other people.” 

That probably reminded you to 
check your phone for texts. Resist, and 
just finish reading. I dare you. 

Last week, in Cafe Roma, the girl 
sitting to my left was furiously typing 
out a wall post, the girl to my right 
was texting and awkwardly laughing 
to herself and the guy sitting at the 
table directly across was drooling as 
his iPod sweetly sung him to sleep. 

So I just sat there, sipping my 
hot chocolate. I sat and I listened to 
the obnoxious clicking of the texts 
being sent and tweets being written. I 
thought, “Why the hell did I come to 
a coffee shop?” I guess I was hoping to 
people-watch or eavesdrop on some 
interesting human-to-human conver-
sations. Maybe even do something 
adventurous and talk to a complete 
stranger. Fat chance.

Coming here as a transfer student, 
it appears that the concentration of 
socially awkward people is much 
higher per square-foot in this school 
than other places. Maybe it’s because 
we’re a school filled with students 
neck-deep in MCAT preparation, or 
our bio majors are too busy research-
ing the cure for cancer. Either way, 
we’re not nicknamed the “UC of the 
Socially Dead” without reason, and 
the influx of technology doesn’t help.

 It’s easy to get comfortable, and 
it’s understandable to sometimes want 
to ignore the world, but remember: 
A little human-to-human interac-
tion never hurt anyone. If your daily 
interactions with people require you 
to be plugged into a device, then take 
the first step in suppressing gadget 
impulses. Set rules for when you can 
and can’t use your phone. Try to walk 
down Library Walk without your 
iPod. Try sitting in the library with 
your phone off. 

Trust me, a few small changes here 
and there won’t kill you and might 
even have a positive effect. You might 
surprise yourself and gain the self-
confidence to stop relying on virtual 
friends and finally talk to that girl in 
your o-chem class — instead of just

HIGHER EDUCATION — Last spring, we 
proved that with enough support, we have 
the power to change our university. After the 
Compton Cookout invitation went viral, stu-
dents and faculty from UCSD, Compton and 
nearby schools came out to protest in soli-
darity. With sheer numbers, UCSD sparked 
a revolution. But what if the students and 
faculty that traveled from UC Irvine, UCLA 
and Compton arrived only to be turned away 
because of a regulation that prohibited non-
UCSD affiliates from protesting on campus? 
What if the protestors from Compton weren’t 
allowed to speak out and join us in solidar-
ity? Would it have been as effective? Probably 
not. 

This past month, Olympic College in 

Bremerton, Wash. drew attention to univer-
sity free speech policies by restricting the 
rights of non-affiliate free speech. A non-
affiliate is anyone who doesn’t take classes, 
teach or officially volunteer at a school. 

Olympic— a public, two-year college— 
has declared that non-student demonstra-
tors must give 48 hours notice and pro-
vide a copy of materials to be distributed. 
Furthermore, non-affiliate protesters are 
limited to five hours for their demonstra-
tions and can only gather in a small area 
called Hyde Park. 

Surprisingly enough, the new regulations 
weren’t the reaction of uptight administra-
tors, but instead were spurred by student 
complaints of nonstudent anti-abortion pro-

testers displaying larger-than-life photos of 
aborted fetuses.

No one likes being told that they’re 
going to hell for being pro-choice, but the 
students are setting a dangerous precedent 
that they might come to regret in the future. 
The vague annoyance of having to tune out 
Library Walk’s Jesus Guy every day is not 
worth giving up free-speech rights. Public 
schools like UCSD and Olympic College 
should put as few restrictions as possible on 
free speech for citizens. While no one can 
fault Olympic for wanting to protect its stu-
dents from stomach-turning photos, creating 
a one-size-fits-all restriction on protesters 

Olympic College’s restrictions on non-affiliate protestors ward off  disruptive crowds, but 
these restrictions might hinder the future efficacy of  campus protests. By Allison Gauss

QUICKTAKES

After “The Simpsons’” controversial re-imag-
ining of their 22-year-old introduction amassed a 
mere 2,305 hits on YouTube last week, Fox pulled 
the plug. But let’s not kid ourselves: Fox knew 
what it was doing when it let graffiti artist Banksy 
transform “The Simpsons’” traditional introduc-
tion. It also knew what it was doing when it pulled 
the clip hours later. It used public outrage and 
negative portrayal of its company to generate a 
tidy profit.

Between the kitten-shredding, panda slavery, 
unicorn abuse and depiction of 20th Century Fox 
as a prison, the intro didn’t paint a kind picture of 
Fox’s business practices. Though the message was 
seemingly the reason that Fox pulled the clip, it 
turns out that Fox authorized Hulu to play the clip 
just 12 hours after the episode aired.

Fox didn’t pull it because it was worried about 
the company’s reputation. Instead, the capitalists 
pulled it because the YouTube hits wouldn’t gener-
ate a profit for the company. Redirecting viewers 
to Hulu, however, rakes in advertising revenue.

It’s a little-known fact that Fox is one the com-
panies that partners with Hulu, meaning they’re 
the ones profiting off of the obnoxious KY Intense 
commercials. Ingeniously, Fox allowed the clip to 
stay on YouTube for a few hours to build steam. 
Then, when people started to hear about the clip, 
they pulled it, forcing the viewers to Hulu.

ÒSimpsonsÕÓÊBanksyÊIntroduction

Let’s face it: “The Simpsons” just isn’t what it 
used to be. It started the season with 9.9 million 
viewers per episode then fell to a mere 6.72 million.  
Its ratings are faltering. The residents of Springfield 
needed something — or someone — to put them 
back on the map; that someone was named Banksy. 

The only reason Fox would allow an artist as 
controversial as Banksy to direct “The Simpsons’” 
intro is to turn heads. Banksy is a big name, and 
already well-versed in using his art to spark inter-
national controversy — and when it comes to TV 
ratings, controversy means limelight. 

Whether you interpreted the opening as bel-
ligerent or brilliant, Fox knew when it signed an 
internationally renowned artist-activist that it would 
rake in attention.

Then Fox stepped it up a notch.
The studio decided to pull the video from 

YouTube — a move that drew even more notoriety 
to the clip. It’s safe to say you probably didn’t watch 
the show live, so when rumors about the intro 
began to swirl and the convenience of YouTube 
was lost, questions like “Was it real? Did it actually 
happen?” began to circulate. These questions lit up 
every media blog and Twitter account, which did 
only one thing: Draw more attention to the show. 

So while Banksy may have been trying to ani-
mate his disgust for the dark side of capitalism, Fox 
was just using him as its publicity stunt-double. 

— Madeline Mann
Staff Writer

Banksy, the artistic demi-god of the hipster 
elite, has forayed into television, creating a dark 
addendum to “The Simpsons’” classic couch gag 
where miserable Asian children slave over the 
creation of “Simpsons” merchandise in subterra-
nean factories. But this important political mes-
sage is lost in the controversy of what happened 
next.  Fox Studios pulled the video off YouTube, 
redirecting the attention back toward the studio 
and in the process cheapening Banksy’s message.

As soon as Fox pulled the clip, people weren’t 
concerned with Banksy’s political message, 
focusing instead on the censorship issue, why the 
clip was being pulled and where they can view 
it now. 

  Instead of questioning the ethics of Fox’s 
out-sourcing practices, the question on everyone’s 
minds is “Where can I find the banned clip?”

The idea that halfway across the world, chil-
dren are being overworked and underpaid to 
manufacture products is not a shocking revela-
tion. Reminders of what “Made in China” (or in 
this case, allegedly South Korea) means, however, 
are often lost in our urge to purchase anything 
with a “Simpsons” logo on it.  Don’t be outraged at 
Fox for pulling the clip (especially since they put 
it back up a few hours later). Be outraged at what 
“The Simpsons” is doing, and why we haven’t 
done much of anything to put an end to it.

  Master’s Degree

Educating Minds and Hearts to Change The World

isn’t the answer. 
If protesters are interrupting 

classes and hindering the students’ 
ability to learn, 
restrictions are nec-
essary. Just as we 
must respect our 
right to free speech, 
as an educational 
institution, we must 
respect our peers’ 
right to learn.

A certain level 
of respect for this 
campus’ educa-
tional purpose must 
be observed. For 
example, the cur-
rent UCSD Free 
Speech Policy limits 
amplified sound 
to 90 decibels, the 
equivalent of a 
heavy truck and 
the level at which 
sound damages the human ear. 
Also, demonstrations must not 
block the path of people or prevent 
them from arriving at their destina-
tion. Sensible restrictions such as 
these ensure that the exercise of 
one person’s rights doesn’t infringe 

on another’s. If people are respect-
fully protesting on campus, the 
school should have respect for the 
protesters’ right to be heard. 

Despite the protests last spring, 
UCSD’s policy 
concerning student 
demonstration are 
liberal — but they 
weren’t always so 
progressive. 

In the spring of 
2007, the UCSD 
Free Speech Policy 
included a clause 
that any gather 
of students that 
could “reasonably 
be expected to 
attract a crowd of 
10 or more people” 
would require a 
reservation from 
the university.

According to 
today’s Free Speech 
Policy, students 

can assemble or table without any 
type of authorization anywhere on 
campus. The policies for non-affil-
iates, however, are more restrictive, 
requiring permission from univer-
sity officials. As we saw last year, 
however, exceptions can and should 

be made. We can only hope that if 
Olympic College decides to stick 
with its new policies, it will also use 
common sense in the enforcement 
of these rules, recognizing that 
there are some situations in which 
they can be relaxed.

 Students and non-students 
should be able to gather anywhere 
that does not disrupt classes or 
normal university activity. 

We all came to UCSD to learn 
and to find our path in life, but 
like we saw last spring, there is 
learning that takes place outside 
a classroom. College is a place to 
hear viewpoints you might not have 
been exposed to in your suburban 
bubble, to become aware of the 
people and the world surround-
ing you, and freedom of speech is 
what guarantees this exchange of 
ideas and positions. Schools must 
remember that they’re not just cre-
ating engineers and doctors, they’re 
nurturing the development of citi-
zens that, today and tomorrow, will 
be running this country.

DRAWING FIRE By Johan De La Torre

 A Real Education is Much More Than What’s in Our Textbooks
▶ PROTESTS, fromÊpageÊ4

Dear Editor,
When I was an editor, The 

Guardian used to stand up for free 
speech. We categorically opposed 
attempts to restrain student expres-
sion, even when we vehemently 
disagreed with the viewpoints 
expressed. After the drubbing given 
to Student-Run Television last quar-
ter, I’d expected the paper to climb 
on board the free speech train and 
ride it all the way to Constitution 
land. Surprised, I read the Sept. 
30 issue  (“An Offer You Can’t 
Refuse,” Sept. 30, 2010), in which 
you actually supported the content 
restrictions A.S. Council placed on 
Triton Television. You said you can’t 
really blame the TTV managers for 
bending over and taking its punish-
ment, since they are apparently get-
ting token sponsorships from Red 
Bull or something equally inane. 
Ridiculous.

Freedom of expression is worth 
more than a case of energy drinks. 
From 2002 until 2006, I hosted a 
twice-weekly political talk show on 
Warren College Television, which 
was broadcast across the campus in 
every dorm room. When WCTV 
broke down, I’d move over to the 
Student Center and broadcast with 
freedom on TTV’s A.S.-funded pre-
decessor, “Student-Run Television.”  
When the Iraq War broke out, we 
covered it. When a UCSD student 
ran for governor to protest tuition 
hikes, we covered it.  When the 
Koala broadcast pornography, got 
banned from TV and the whole 
campus voted to overturn the ban, 
we covered it. When Bill Gates, 
Joe Lieberman, John Kerry, Randy 
Jackson and Mayor Jerry Sanders 
came to campus, we interviewed 
them and broadcasted it to 4,000 
students living on campus. And 
that was just WCTV. There were six 
operating student-run TV stations 
on campus in 2006. How many are 
left? And what do they broadcast 
now? PowerPoint slides advertising 
last month’s ice cream social? That’s 
a waste of resources, a waste of stu-
dent potential and it’s just sad.

The Guardian’s acceptance of 
censorship is just as sad. UCSD is 
not the campus I left.

—Daniel Watts
UCSD Alumnus, 2006

Dear Editor,
When I voted for the people on 

A.S. Council, I expected them to step 
above the fray that usually plagues 
the A.S. Council and work towards 
positive change through increased col-
laboration with their colleagues. Most 
of them, such as Senator Parminder 
Sandhu, showed promise and made 
me optimistic about the current 
Council’s ability to represent students. 
Unfortunately, my expectations were 
quickly dashed when his thoughts 
on the postponement of the budget 
were published in the Oct. 14 “Off the 
Table” article of The Guardian. Senator 
Sandhu contributed to the very fray 
that oftentimes is the antithesis of an 
effective and productive Council.

Like an idiot full of sound and fury, 
attuned to the soothing echoes of his 
hollow voice, this senator did nothing 
with his bemoaning of the supposed 
decline in the condition of the Office 
of the President. Senator Sandhu, criti-
cizing your colleagues does not help 
them become better representatives. 
As the representative of about 1,750 
students, what do you accomplish 
standing idly by and offering scathing 
critiques of your fellow councilmem-
bers who are — to the best of their 
abilities — fulfilling their duties?

I didn’t vote for student representa-
tives to sound off in The Guardian. I 
voted for representatives to actually do 
something productive and tangible in 
terms of ensuring the collective suc-
cess of the entire A.S. Council. Feeling 
“sad for the condition of the Office of 
the President” and not doing anything 
to aid President Ben Hassine in resolv-
ing this issue essentially fulfills the 
very sentiments you expressed in last 
Wednesday’s issue: You are clearly “not 
respecting the Associated Students 
[and] not fulfilling [your] duties to the 
level that should be expected.”

As a child, UCSD literature professor and MFA Writing Program director Sarah Shun-lien Bynum had little desire to become an author: 
Instead, she nursed the dream of forming a band and 
living off her piano prowess. She never imagined that 
she would become a critically acclaimed writer, featured 
in The New Yorker’s prestigious “20 Under 40” issue (a 
list of 20 of the best contemporary American fiction 
authors under the age of 40) published July 5, 2010.

This wasn’t Bynum’s first brush with the illustri-
ous magazine. Her previous short story “Yurt,” about 
the love affairs of elementary school teachers, was 
published in The New Yorker two years earlier, on July 
21, 2008. The 2010 issue features Bynum’s story “The 
Erlking,” about a mother and daughter who attend 
a Waldorf school fair where unusual mishaps occur. 
Originally scheduled to print prior to the “20 Under 
40” issue, magazine editors notified Bynum that they 
would be pushing back the publication date of her piece 
in order to include her.  Typically, editors only con-
tact writers to notify them if they’ve been accepted or 
rejected, but in Bynum’s case they made an exception.

Once the news reached Bynum, she was taken by 
surprise. Bynum only wrote “The Erlking” (from the 
German poem “Erlkönig”) as a favor to fellow writer 

Kate Bernheimer, who was creating an anthology of 
revised fairy tales. After weeks of careful consideration, 
Bynum decided to write a modern retelling of her 
favorite folk tale. Depending on the interpretation, the 
original “Erlkönig” illustrates the death of a young child 
 — either through illness or supernatural beings. 

“The point of the anthology was to revisit a favorite 
fairy tale, so I chose a German folktale, ‘The Erlking,’” 
Bynum said. “It was a wonderful little poem written by 
Goethe that is often attached to a song. I used that story 
as a jumping-off point.”

With Germanic inspiration in tow, Bynum proceed-
ed to take several slow months — between shuttling 
her 5-year-old daughter to various summer activities, 
attending her book club and tending her vegetable gar-
den — to weave the intricacies of her short story.

“I’m actually a really slow writer,” Bynum said. “It 
requires a certain concentration that’s hard to muster 
when there are so many distractions in my life and the 
world. Just to find a space where I can concentrate hard 
enough to write is in and of itself a major task. It’s so 
tempting to have distractions take over.”

Though she has improved at committing to bouts 
of intense concentration, Bynum still concedes that, 
for her,  writing has always been a lengthy process 
inundated with difficulty. Her first novel, Madeleine is 
Sleeping — a story about a young girl’s coming of age — 
took ten years of sporadic bursts of writing to complete. 
She relies on the support of her friends and mentors in 
order to get her through elongated periods of writer’s 
block. But even with two novels, eight short stories 
and several personal essays under her belt, Bynum still 
occasionally succumbs to doubt.

“Writing has never been easy for me,” Bynum said. 
“When I’m in the process of writing, I’m just thinking 
about the end of the sentence and how I’m going to get 
to the end of the paragraph. I just hope that I can con-
tinue to finish the story.”

Bynum’s love for writing is inspired by a childhood 
home filled with music, books and culture (Her fam-
ily hosted several foreign exchange students in high 
school.) The days when she visited Louisa May Alcott’s 
house in her hometown of 
Boston and scribbled clum-
sy limericks or the occa-
sional short work of fiction 
in her school notebook 
provided the genesis for her 
future literary career.

 Today, she draws much 
of her inspiration from 
her daily life — a visit to 
the marketplace, teaching, 
spending time with her 
children. “Literature was 
my first love,” Bynum said. 
“I love literature. I love 
books. I love talking about 
ideas. I love the conversa-
tions that come with writ-
ing. I can’t quite imagine 
anything else.”

Through every piece she struggles with, Bynum said 
she feels lucky to have a strong basis of support for her 
career. She still keeps in contact with her ninth-grade

When Sarah Simpson tells people she’s 
on the Equestrian Team, she usually hears 
the same response: “Equestrian team? So 
do you guys, like, sit around and ask each 
other questions?”

Not exactly. 
Simpson, a third-year from Eleanor 

Roosevelt College, is co-captain of 
UCSD’s Club Equestrian team with ERC 
junior Taylor Coe and Warren College 
senior Monica O’Mahony. She has been 
riding horses since age eight and contin-
ues to ride and show horses as part of the 
team here on campus. 

The team welcomes all skill levels, 
from riders who have competed in the 
Grand Prix to those whose only experi-
ence is a guided horseback tour at a dude 
ranch. 

“The best thing about the club is 
spending time with horses,” O’Mahony 
said. “We’re all just passionate about hors-
es.”

As a club sport, Equestrian is part of 

the International Horse Show Association 
rather than NCAA athletics, but they 
compete against a number of top schools 
in Southern California and Arizona, 
including UCLA, USC, Cal Poly Pomona, 
Arizona State and University of Arizona. 

The team’s approximately 35 members 
practice once a week at Tartan Farms 
stable in Del Mar. During Fall and Winter 
Quarters, the club competes against other 
area schools: Last year, the team sent 
seven riders to Zones at Stanford and four 
riders to Nationals. 

“We haven’t made it to nationals as a 
team for a little bit, but that’s our plan this 
year,” Simpson said.  

Riders compete in one of two styles: 
Western (cowboy hats and flashy tricks) 
or English (khaki breeches and classy 
dressage). English is apparently much 
more popular in San Diego than Western 
— about 25 people on the team choose 
the former. 

“English and Western never compete 

against each other because they are two 
completely different realms of compet-
ing, kind of like within the realm of 
hockey, [where] there is ice hockey and 
roller hockey,” equestrian team member 
and Revelle College sophomore Morgan 
Atiken-Young explained.

Dues for the year are $385, not includ-
ing $20 to register for a show and $45 for 
each lesson. To save on costs, the team 
borrows horses for practice and shares 
horses for competitions. Members also 
bring two or three of their own horses 
to competitions to add to the pool of 
horses that riders can be assigned to for 
each event. 

Training for competitions includes 
practicing specific positions (like jump-
ing position)   and a rider can get knocked 
from first to sixth place in a competition 
if a horse breaks gait (walks when it 
should trot) or if the rider’s foot falls out 
of a stirrup. 

“Because you don’t know the horses 
well, you pick a random horse at a show, 
and it can get very frustrating because 
you are a good rider, but sometimes it’s 
just hard to show it,” O’Mahony said. 
“Our sport is very different because it’s 50 
percent us, 50 percent the horse.”

The team meets weekly in a RIMAC 
Conference room to schedule upcoming 
competitions, as well as to plan social 
events and volunteer opportunities like 
line dancing and bull-riding. 

As the team’s motto goes“Work hard, 
play hard, ride harder.” BY ZOË SOPHOS

There’s something no one wants you to know about studying 
abroad. It’s a secret so well concealed by slews of Eurotrip Facebook 
albums and Programs Abroad Office employees that it’s remained the 
classified knowledge of the experienced — except, you know, until now. 

Fret not, Mom and Dad: It doesn’t involve prostitution rings 
or those curious foam parties. It does, however, involve loneliness. 
Because for all the joys of immigrating to a country where the drinking 
age is 16 and the locals’ primary interests really are eating, napping and 
enjoying life while it lasts, the initial isolation is terrifying. 

No one wants to admit it, but being thousands of miles removed 
from reliable electricity, California burritos or even restaurants with 
free tap water can be horribly unsettling at first. It can make you spend 
unthinkably dull nights on the computer, with the expectation that 
staying current with a news feed or “Weeds” will somehow make you 
closer to home. (Spoiler alert: It won’t.)

These are things I’m not supposed to say, of course. The plane’s 
wheels touching tarmac is supposed to mark the beginning of explora-
tion: of winding boulevards, of unpronounceable cuisine, of bustling 
street markets plucked from Eat, Pray, Love.

Naturally there’s an acute shame in feeling this way. No one takes 
out extra student loans or depletes their college fund to bum around 
an ill-lit bedroom 7,000 miles from home (not to mention choking up 
at particularly emotional moments on “Desperate Housewives”) — but 
this has, in fact, been my mopey reality in this beautiful, hedonistic city 
on the Mediterranean.

Because I enrolled at the University of Barcelona for the semester 
and found housing on my own, I didn’t get any structured program or 
a network of wide-eyed partners in crime. This has been a bigger chal-
lenge than I’d expected. Plus, trying to make plans with new friends is 
sort of awkward when you’re iffy on the future tense.

So, given the chance to visit my dad last week while he was on a 
business trip to Switzerland, I didn’t hesitate. I also didn’t waste any 
time in unloading my troubles — ones that I probably hadn’t concealed 
very well anyway, given the unprecedented frequency and dreariness of 
my e-mails. (“Class in the morning — TV in bed tonight. Won’t forget 
to floss!!”)

Supportive as ever, my dad understood why I hadn’t been happy, 
and told me that I could come home whenever I pleased. He also 
reminded me that his father had always dreamt of coming to Europe, 
but never got to — and that this trip marks my fourth excursion here. 

Of course, with a study abroad office that’s not bashful in brag-
ging about how many students it sends overseas, it’s easy to forget that 
relocating internationally for 3 to 9 months is an impossibility for oh, I 
don’t know, almost everyone alive today. With that in mind, there’s no 
real excuse for wasting away in bed in one of the most beautiful cities 
in the world — not even the a thrilling cliffhanger on Wisteria Lane.

In addition, barring any unforeseen future as a lottery winner or 
trophy spouse, I don’t anticipate any other time in life when I’ll have 
as few responsibilities or as much freedom as I do today. This is why, 
after 6 weeks of consuming sinful quantities of streaming TV, I have 
resolved to get out more. 

I will limit my time online, but not my churro intake. I will fumble 
shamelessly through conversations with strangers. Then, upon my 
triumphant return come Christmast time, I’ll have lived— actually 
lived— on the continent my grandpa never had the privilege of meet-
ing.

The moment you walk into Dick’s Last Resort, check your dignity at the door. Look up. A pair of panties emblazoned with I ¤ Dicks hangs on the wall. I 
went to the restaurant for a birthday party and, though I really 
should have known better, I had no idea I was about to pay for 
everyone to be, well, a dick to us. The décor is reminiscent of 
a rowdy sports restaurant, exaggerated by the hundred bras that 
line the bar. Some have names, some have numbers, and some 
look like they’re 20 years old. Surprisingly, I liked Dick’s  — it 
was deliciously gaudy and occasionally just delicious. 

After a 19-minute drive to the restaurant’s location on 4th 
Street, my girlfriends and I were ready to chow down. The 

night started with a taciturn server coming over with plastic 
bibs and taking his time tying them on each person.  Next, 
a disgruntled waiter jotted down our drinks, not hesitating 
to tell those who ordered water that they were cheap.  Before 
our drinks arrived, the waiter returned with a white paper hat  
— reading “Birthday Bimbo is not cheap, she just dresses like 
it” — that he plopped on the lucky girl. Throughout the night, 
numerous hats were passed out to our party, with charmers like 
“My name is Bubbles,” “I blow Bubbles,” “I am just like this hat, 
white and flat,” “Backdoor Princess” and “I have better balance 
on my knees.”  

The gut-bustingly funny abuse didn’t stop there; our bib 

server had taken to walking around the restaurant, popping 
balloons behind oblivious customers to startle them out of 
their stupor.  Fed up, a friend of mine yelled at him,( in jest, of 

course); he responded, ever gracious, with a middle finger. 
Another girl needed change for a $20 bill, but when she 
handed him the green, he stuffed it in his boxers and walked 
away (luckily, he returned with change a minute later).  Two 
girls requested photos and the bib server was happy to 
oblige. He readily posed for the camera, convincing two girls 
to pose with him in a sex position (sans nudity).  

Dick’s waiters knew how to hit where it hurt — they 
mocked girls’ eating habits, teasing them for opting for a 
salad (though, ironically, their salads turned out to be quite 
good). Taking the cue, I ordered a hearty helping of ribs and 
was complimented for knowing “how to eat right.”  Despite 
the hooplah and their prompt arrival, the ribs were a dry 
and flavorless letdown, akin to eating ribs from Plaza dining 
hall. The dinner was a bit pricey for those who watch their 
wallets — main dishes can cost up to $20.

 Fortunately, Dick’s redeemed itself — the desserts were 
divine.  The Mile-High Peanut Butta Pie was huge, incred-
ibly thick and insanely creamy.  I also treated myself to 

an Extreme Brownie Meltdown, Dick’s version of a brownie 
sundae, made from the perfect storm of fresh, warm brownie 
and sweet, cold ice cream.  It’s worth the laughs: The antics of 
the staff made my night, and the waiter was (surprisingly) kind 
behind his rude façade. He gave the birthday girl a free dessert 
on his dime and helped split the check once the bill came in. 
Always funny, Dick’s take on the dining experience is a refresh-
ing novelty.  If down and dirty dining is your thing, be sure to 
grab a bite at Dick’s —  not for the food, but for that rare chance 
to sport a demoralizing “I wear granny panties” hat.

English teacher, who first nurtured her talent and encour-
aged her to write.

“Forming writing friendships are really important,” 
Bynum said. “You need to find people who are good readers 
for your work and for whom you are a good reader. These 
are the relationships that will last long after the class is over, 
long after you’ve graduated. It’s having someone whom you 
really trust, who you can share your work with. It’s someone 
who can be a source of support, camaraderie and sympathy.”

Not only does Bynum rely on her own personal com-
munity, but she also finds enlightenment within UCSD 
academia. According to Bynum, the most exciting part of 
being a professor is the opportunity to meet new, young and 
passionate literary voices in her fiction class. 

“Every quarter, you encounter a voice on the page that 
you’ve never heard before,” Bynum said a few days ago. 
“Sometimes in my really large introductory class, I’ll come 
across a new writer that just blows me away; he’s doing 
something that I’ve never seen before. It’s always a sense of 
discovery, a sense of surprise. It makes me very hopeful of 
where fiction can go. There’s so much uncharted territory, 
and so many young writers excited about charting that ter-
ritory.”

It’s a mutually beneficial system — Bynum’s students 
have frequently helped her improve her writing by experi-

menting with new forms.
“There’s a lot of risk takers among students,” Bynum said. 

“For me, that’s exciting, and it challenges me to take risks 
with my writing.”

As the director of the MFA Writing Program,  — now in 
its sophomore year of offering degrees in fiction or poetry— 
Bynum hopes to better define the relatively new program 
and clearly distinguish it from others.

“It’s been really fun, to start something from scratch, to 
build something new,” Bynum said. “And the first MFA class 
has been really great; they’re really contributing enormously 
of themselves to shaping the identity of the program.”

For the time being, Bynum plans to continue working on 
her next piece, a tale about a haunted house (about which 
she is regrettably mum). 

As for the new generation of writers that haven’t yet had 
the benefit of her teaching, Bynum offers some advice.

“Keep a low overhead — make choices that will allow 
you to live simply, so that you can continue to write, so that 
you don’t have to be working at some other profession to 
support your own expensive lifestyle,” Bynum said. “If you 
can keep a low overhead and if you can live simply, that will 
make a big difference in terms of protecting your own writ-
ing.”

Triton Water Polo Falls to UC Davis, Beats Santa Clara in Weekend Matches

JOHN HANACEK/GUARDIAN FILE

Senior driver Bryce Madsen and the No. 9 Tritons dropped a 6-5 match to UC Davis on Oct. 16, but bounced 
back with a 10-7 win over Santa Clara the next day.

Staff Writer

MEN’S WATER POLO — Men’s water 
polo played two strong games over 
the weekend against two of Northern 
California’s top teams, but came away 
with mixed results. The No. 9 Tritons 
lost to then 11th-ranked UC Davis 
in a close match that ended 6-5 on 
Friday, but came back fighting the 
next day to beat No. 11 Santa Clara 
10-7.

Against Davis, the Tritons played  
a defensive battle, with each team 
finding goals hard to come by. The 
first period saw a goal within the 
first three minutes through a suc-
cessful counterattack by the Aggies. 
Sophomore utility Brian Donohoe 
was able to tie it up just before the 
clock ran out for the period.

“Both teams played very physical 
and covered on the counter well, so it 
turned into a front court battle both 
ways,” Donohoe said. “When you’re 
playing from behind in a game like 
that, it’s tough to get consecutive goals 
and get it rolling like that, especially 
on the road. We gave ourselves oppor-
tunities to win the game but didn’t 
really capitalize on enough of those to 
pull it out.”

At the start of the second quarter, 
redshirt junior driver Graham Saber 

put UCSD up 2-1 with a goal from 
two meters out, but his score was 
swiftly negated by a long shot by 
Davis’s Walter Eggert that again tied 
the game. Despite another goal by 
Donohoe, the Aggies continued to 
bring a lot of physical power to the 
pool and the teams went into halftime 
with the game at 4-3.

“The refs were consistent both 
ways, but they were allowing for 
almost a wrestling match,” Donohoe 
said. “Man for man, they are probably 
bigger than we are; we don’t have the 
biggest team and we do rely on our 
speed.”

Both teams scored two more goals 
in the third quarter with scores by 
Donohoe and senior driver Bryce 
Madsen. The Aggies were able to hold 
the Tritons at that 6-5 score despite 
three attempts by Donohoe and a 
final possession with 24 seconds on 
the clock.

“We don’t like losing, but yesterday 
at Davis was a really good water polo 
game,” head coach Denny Harper 
said. “Davis is a really, really difficult 
place to play at. But I was pleased with 
how hard we played yesterday, and 
even in defeat you get a general sense 
of ‘Oh boy, UCSD is improving and 
getting better.’”

Playing the next day against Santa 
Clara, the team was able to bounce 

back and snap a two-match losing 
streak. The Tritons started strong with 
a goal in the first minute, and never 
trailed en route to the victory. The 
first quarter showed a 4-2 lead for 
UCSD, but the Tritons extended their 
lead to 8-4 by the end of the third 
quarter.

The Broncos tried to come back 
in the fourth quarter with two early 
goals, but the Tritons were able to hold 
on and end the game 10-7.

“This was Santa Clara’s only game 
this weekend and it was their home-
coming alumni weekend,” Harper 
said. “So if you kind of couple the 
two things together, in that we also 
responded from a tough defeat by 
playing so well today, I think that’s a 
really good sign.”

The Tritons head back to 
Canyonview Pool at 2 p.m. this 
Saturday, Oct. 23 against the No. 
10-ranked Loyola Marymount 
University. 

“[Santa Clara] was a big confer-
ence game and we knew we needed 
to win, we knew we had to come out 
strong,” Madsen said. “We feel good, 
we feel like we finished business, and 
we’re looking forward to LMU this 
Saturday.”

ing a hip pointer injury. Josh Cohen 
replaced Brennan, and the freshman 
goalkeeper’s first minutes with UCSD 
proved crucial in attaining the win. 

Cohen denied Chico State a num-
ber of dangerous attempts at the 
Triton goal as the game remained 
tied late in the second half.  Cohen 
was helpless, however, as the draw 
was broken in the 88th minute when 
Celosmanovic finished an unassisted 
goal from 20 yards out.  The for-
ward sent a hard left-footed shot past 
Cohen to put Chico State up 2-1.  

With less than a minute left in the 
regulation time period, the Tritons 
pushed forward, searching for an 
equalizer. They found redemption 
when senior midfielder David Bakal 
scored a header off a cross from fresh-
man defender Cory Wolfrom.  

“We went down with about four 
minutes left, and we never gave up; we 
kept fighting,” Bakal said, regarding 
his last-minute goal. “Cory [Wolfrom] 
sent in a great ball and I was able to 
finish it.” 

The goal sent the game into over-
time with the score tied at 2-2.  After 
90 minutes of play, neither squad 
showed any sign of fatigue as they 
battled for possession up and down 
the pitch.  With 50 seconds left in 
the first period of extra time, the 
Tritons won a free kick just outside 
of the Wildcat goal box. Sophomore 
defender Adam Zernik lined up the 
kick and sent a dipping shot over 
the wall. Once again, Chico’s keeper 
could only deflect the shot, allowing 
an onrushing Kakura to bury the ball 
into the back of the net.

“(Zernik) did well to put the ball 
on target and force the keeper to make 
a save,” Kakura said. “I was just in the 
right place at the right time.”

The win moves UCSD up to 
fourth in the CCAA South division, 
and marks its seventh consecutive 
game without a loss.

“We just take it one game at a 
time,” Bakal said. “We know that if we 
play our game, we can beat any team 
in the country.” 

UCSD will need to take that con-
fidence into its match against a tough 
Cal State Stanislaus squad on Sunday. 
The Tritons expect Brennan to sit out 
the match because of the injury. The 
game will kick off at 2 p.m. at Triton 
Soccer Field.

score with less than 10 minutes 
remaining in the first half. Chico 
midfielder Ashley Perlman sent 
a curved cross to midfielder Lisa 
Webster, who got on the end of it to 
redirect the ball into the net.

The Tritons maintained their 2-1 
lead into the second half, although 
the Wildcat attack continued to put 
pressure on the Tritons. Sophomore 
goalkeeper Kristin Armstrong was 
forced to make three saves on the 
game, while Chico’s Oliver made 
two.

Despite the Wildcats’ pressure, 
UCSD secured the win in the 60th 
minute when Ilg recorded her sec-

ond assist of the game. Ilg crossed 
a ball from the right side into the 
penalty area to junior midfielder 
Shelby Wong, who hit a volley into 
the back of the net. The goal marked 
Wong’s first of the season, and Ilg’s 
third assist.  

The 3-1 score held until the end 
of the match, although Chico State 
mustered a couple of dangerous 
shots on goal.  The best Wildcat 
attempt happened just 5 minutes 
before the end of the game, when 
Armstrong denied a Chico forward’s 
well-placed header on goal with a 
diving save.  

“It wasn’t the prettiest soc-
cer we’ve played — at times it was 

downright ugly,” junior midfielder 
and reigning CCAA Player of the 
Week Annie Wethe said. “But every-
one was giving 100 percent and 
heart won it for us today.” 

UCSD will look to continue its 
winning streak on Oct. 17 against 
Cal State Stanislaus. The Warriors 
are 7-3-1 and are currently in sec-
ond place in the CCAA North divi-
sion. A win against the Warriors 
could allow the Tritons to claim 
the top spot in the South division 
— depending on other results from 
around the conference.

12 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

STILL FLYING HIGH

MEN’S SOCCER— The men’s soccer 
team secured a goal in overtime on 
Friday night, giving the Tritons a 3-2 
upset over No. 14 Chico State.

The Chico State Wildcats came 
into the match heavily favored, sit-
ting on top of the CCAA North divi-
sion with a 7-3 record. However, the 
Tritons held Chico scoreless in the 
first half, with the two teams battling 
to a 0-0 draw at the end of the first 
period.  

UCSD was able to crack the tough 
Wildcat defense at the start of the 
second half when senior defender 
Jared Kakura scored off a rebound 
from inside the goal box. Sophomore 
defender Alex Portela sent a short 
corner kick to midfielder Andisheh 
Bagheri, who fired in a low shot that 
the Chico keeper could only deflect 
back into play. Kakura was there to 
finish, and the Tritons went up 1-0 

just 54 seconds into the second half.
With the lead against the Wildcats, 

the Tritons dropped back to defend 
their lead against a surging Chico 
offense. But in the 62nd minute, 
the Triton defense gave way when 
Wildcat forward Ferid Celosmanovic 
capitalized on a poor clearance to 
finish his ninth goal of the season.  
The Wildcats’ top goal scorer sent a 
volley into the far post to beat UCSD 
redshirt freshman goalkeeper Jesse 
Brennan.  

With the game tied at 1-1, both 
squads opened up the game as they 
pushed forward to attack.  Chico com-
bined for a chance on goal in the 73rd 
minute, forcing Brennan to make a 
diving save. The UCSD goalkeeper 
successfully saved the shot, but was 
forced to leave the game after sustain-

Good debut. Very quick o� the line, and showed some brave goalkeeping.
Alec Arsht (CB)   7
Rock solid in the back, making several important clearances. Should have scored in the

Both UCSD soccer 
teams get wins over 

Chico State this 
weekend, including a 
dramatic men’s match 
that saw heartbreak 

turn to delight.

WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL — The 
UCSD women’s volleyball team is get-
ting back to where they want to be. A 
a pair of weekend wins put the Tritons 
are above .500 in conference play and 
in the thick of the playoff race.

“I think we need to win all of our 
matches, and we need to beat all the 
teams we lost to in five games in the 
first half of the season,” head coach 
Ricci Luyties said. “I think our chances 
are good. I think they believe they can 
beat anybody, and I hope they know 
on any night we could lose to anybody 
if we’re not playing well. We’ve been 
through the first half of the season and 
we’ve learned from it.”

The Tritons recorded a 3-2 win 
against Sonoma State on Friday, break-
ing a streak of four straight losses in 
matches that went to a fifth game. 
UCSD won with set scores of 25-23, 
25-21, 22-25, 20-25 and 15-8. The team 
then traveled to Humboldt State on 
Saturday, where they picked up a rela-
tively easy 3-1 win with set scores of 
25-15, 22-25, 25-19 and 25-14.

The Tritons won the first two sets, 
but allowed the Seawolves to force a 
fifth game after dropping the next two. 
However, the Tritons shot out to a 6-0 
lead in the final set, eventually taking 
the set and the match.  

“I didn’t like going five [sets] 
because we won the first two,” Luyties 
said. “But I think that was good for our 
team, to get that out and be successful. I 
really think we played well in game five 
too, so that was a nice change from our 
past games.” 

Junior Roxy Brunsting led the way 
for the Tritons, as she recorded her first 
career triple-double with 16 kills, 33 
assists and 17 digs.

“She set very well, she had a lot 
of key kills at the end of games and 
she played great defense,” Luyties said. 
“That’s pretty much everything we 
could want from a player.”  

Brunsting continued her out-
standing weekend against Humboldt, 
recording her second consecutive tri-
ple-double with 12 kills, 20 assists and 
16 digs. With junior outside hitter Katie 
Condon adding a match-high 14 kills, 
the Tritons limited Humboldt to an 
abysmal .023 hitting percentage and 
UCSD registered its third straight win. 

With these wins, the Tritons moved

  MEN’S SOCCER PLAYER RATINGS — UC San Diego vs. Chico State

WOMEN’S SOCCER— The wom-
en’s soccer team collected its fifth 
straight win on Friday, picking up 
a 3-1 victory over Chico State. The 
Tritons also extended their unbeat-
en run to eight matches.

After a rocky start to confer-
ence play knocked them out of the 
national rankings, the Tritons have 
rebounded beautifully, moving up 
to second in the CCAA South divi-
sion and No. 22 in the nation. The 
win moved UCSD to 7-2-2 in the 
CCAA and dropped the Wildcats 
down to 5-6.

The Tritons converted their first 
shot on goal six minutes into the 
game, when junior forward Sarah 
McTigue found forward Annette 
Ilg in the penalty box. Ilg pushed 
past Chico State goalkeeper Sydney 
Oliver to score her sixth goal of the 
season and put the Tritons up 1-0. 

Ilg — who has earned a starting 
position in the past three games 
and seen her minutes increase — 
continued to contribute to the 
Triton offense by tallying another 
assist just 7 minutes later. Ilg and 
McTigue once again combined to 
put in a cross, which fell at the feet 
of Danielle Dixon. The sophomore 
midfielder lofted a shot to beat the 
Wildcat goalkeeper.  

“I got a pass to my left on the 
top of the box, and even though 
I’m stronger with my right, I took a 
chance and shot it,” Dixon said.

Dixon, who played more of a 
supporting midfielder role last year, 
has been given a larger role in the 
offense and recorded her second 
goal of the season.
