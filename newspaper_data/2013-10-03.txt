UCSD Protesters Demonstrate 
Against Janet “NapolitaNO”

.3%%,M,0'N

Students protested in front of Geisel Library last Monday in light of former 
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano’s start of term as UC president.

UCSD students rallied by “Silent Tree” on Library Walk to protest Janet Napolitano’s appointment as president of the UC system on Monday, Sept. 30.
The protest began with a banner drop on Geisel with a sign 

that read “No to NapolitaNO” on the new president’s first day in 
office. Maintenance workers joined the students to speak about 
their experiences working in the UC system. 

A representative of the student coalition known as the Strike 
Committee, Juan Campos, said that Napolitano was responsible 
for the recent pay cuts that campus maintenance workers face.

Another common concern with Napolitano’s appointment 
was her involvement in record-breaking undocumented immi-
grant deportations during her term as U.S. State Secretary of 
Homeland Security; in 2012 alone, the department was respon-
sible for the deportation of over 400,000 people. 

In 2010, during Napolitano’s term, UCSD graduate student 
Mark Farrales was forced to undergo a series of deportation 
trials and hearings for living in the country illegally, following 
the death of his illegal immigrant father. He was later granted a 
year’s reprieve to obtain citizenship.

San Diego Prepares for 2013 Mayoral Special Election

The shutdown could also 
affect UC internships and 
national research grant 
opportunities.

The city of San Diego will hold a 
special mayoral election on Nov. 19, 
following former Mayor Bob Filner’s 
resignation in September.

Filner resigned from office nine 
months into his three-year term as 
mayor in the midst of charges relating 
to the sexual harassment of nearly 20 
women. In a deal with San Diego City 
Council, Filner agreed to leave office in 
exchange for coverage of legal fees and 
settlement costs.

According to public accusations, 
the 70-year-old former mayor groped 
and made inappropriate comments to 
people including city employees, mili-
tary veterans, a nurse, business execu-
tives and other officials.

Immediately following Filner’s res-
ignation on Sept. 2, Democrat City 

Council President Todd Gloria became 
acting mayor — a position he will hold 
until a new mayor is elected in 90 days.

As of last week, 11 candidates — 
including former UCSD Professor 
Nathan Fletcher — qualified for the

The federal government shutdown 
that began Tuesday, Oct. 1 at 12:01 
a.m. could affect UCSD students who 
receive financial aid, as well as campus 
researchers receiving grants. UCSD 
students at internships in Washington, 
D.C. will also be furloughed as nones-
sential personnel until Congress agrees 
on a budget or passes a continuing 
resolution.

The shutdown is the result of 
Congress’ failure to establish and pass 
a budget. Each year, the House and 
Senate must pass 12 appropriations 
bills to fund government agencies. 
This year’s budget was halted due to 
a fundamental disagreement between 
House Republicans and Senate 
Democrats about providing funding 
for the Affordable Care Act.

The United States government has 
been operating without a budget since 
2009 and has relied on stopgap resolu-
tions to keep federal services func-
tioning. The last stopgap measure was 
passed in March, expiring on Sept. 30.

The Department of Education 
released a contingency plan guarantee-
ing funding to Pell Grants and federal 
student loans for the first week of the 
shutdown.

“A protracted delay in Department 
obligations and payments beyond 
one week would severely curtail the 
cash flow to school districts, colleges 
and universities ... that depend on the 
Department’s funds to support their 
services,” the plan read. Should the 
shutdown last longer than a week, the 
department will see a personnel short-
age that will cause delays in processing 
federal loan paperwork.

According to the plan, other stu-
dent financial aid programs are not 
guaranteed to keep functioning.

“FSA employees working in areas 
not directly related to Pell Grants or 
Direct Student Loans, such as the 
Campus-Based Programs of College 
Work-Study ... would not be exempt-
ed,” the statement read.

The possibility of obtaining research 
grants will also be affected, with fund-
ing, processing and approval for new 
scientific research heavily delayed.

Students within the University of 
California Washington Center, inad-
vertently lost internship opportunities 
with the closed government agencies.

“I will enjoy these days of vacation, 
but I wouldn’t want it to last too long,” 
UCDC participant and Department of 
Education intern Adam Jackson said.

UCSD researchers recently dis-
covered mechanisms within the chol-
era toxin, sometimes known as CTX, 
that lead to severe diarrhea, intro-
ducing the possibility of new therapy 
developments to treat cholera.

A research team led by UCSD 
biology professor Ethan Bier used 
fruit flies and mice to study the cel-
lular mechanisms of CTX that lead to 
diarrhea and may subsequently cause 
sudden, intense dehydration.

Bier’s laboratory collaborated 
closely with the laboratory of UCSD 
School of Medicine professor of 
pediatrics Dr. Victor Nizet. On Sept. 
11, their findings were published in 
the “Cell Host & Microbe.”

“Cholera toxin disrupts traffick-
ing of proteins to cell junctions that 
hold cells together or are respon-
sible for cells communicating to one 
another,” Bier said. “We exposed 
human cells grown in culture as well 
as cells in the guts of living fruit 
flies and mice to CTX and examined 

its effects on transport 
of proteins to cell-cell 
junctions.”

By increasing the 
level of Rab11, a traffick-
ing protein CTX usually 
attacks, the researchers 
were able to reverse the 
effects of CTX.

Bier’s laboratory had 
focused on anthrax tox-
ins and realized that one 
of the anthrax toxins 
caused vascular endo-
thelial cells — the cells 
lining blood vessels — 
to pull apart, resulting 
in leaky blood vessels. 
This lead to a discov-
ery that a step in the 
transporting proteins to 
cell-cell junctions had 
been disrupted. Seeing 
similarities in intestines infected by 
cholera and the blood vessels, the 
Bier laboratory hypothesized CTX 
acted in a similar fashion.

“[In the future,] we are interested 

in asking whether other pathogens 
that cause diarrhea — including cer-
tain strains of E. coli, viruses, cryp-
tosporidia — also decrease transport 
to cell junctions,” Bier said. “Another 
interesting question is whether 

stresses such as starvation or inflam-
mation of the bowel also disrupt this 
process.”

special election ballot, out of 40 con-
tenders who filed intents to run in 
September.

“For UCSD students, especially 
those who got to take one of Nathan 
Fletcher’s classes last year, I think see-
ing him run for mayor makes poli-
tics and public service something real, 
something they feel connected to and 
something they can aspire to them-
selves,” UCSD Professor of political 
science Thad Kousser said. “Plus, they 
might enjoy walking into the ballot box 
and getting to vote for — or against — 
someone who gave them a grade.”

Fletcher, a Democrat and the curre 
nt frontrunner, previously ran for 
mayor in 2012, finishing in third place. 
He is also a former assemblyman, 
focused on bettering city government 
and improving jobs and education.

22 year-old SDSU student Michael 
Kemmer also qualified for the ballot, 
under a technology-focused campaign 
that will push a “city of the future” idea.

“There’s a lot of room for oppor-
tunity and a lot of room for change 
within the city government,” Kemmer 
said. “We’re focusing on SUSTAIN: 
San Diegans United for Sustainable 
Technology and Innovation Now, and 
we have a whole bunch of fixes focused 
on that for the city.”

Other candidates include city 
council members Kevin Faulconer and 
David Alvarez, former city attorney 
Mike Aguirre, attorney Hud Collins, 
nonprofit organization director 
Bruce Coons, veteran and adminis-
trator Harry Dirks, engineer Simon 
Moghadam, former contractor Lincoln 
Pickard and construction superinten-
dent Tobia Pettus.

According to the San Diego city 

charter, the special election — set to 
cost $6 million for the city — must be 
held within 90 days; if no candidate 
receives over 50 percent of the vote, the 
city will hold a runoff election.

Student Organized Voter Access 
Committee Executive Director Kyle 
Heiskala hopes that UCSD students 
will get involved in the election.

“Although the special election orig-
inated from unfortunate circumstanc-
es, it has given UCSD students another 
opportunity to see our political impact 
in the San Diego community,” Heiskala 
said. “The challenge for SOVAC has 
been getting students excited about 
participating in the selection of the 
new mayor while trying to maintain 
the momentum our organization 
worked hard for last fall.”

“We’re protesting Janet 
Napolitano’s appointment but also 
the cuts to transportation on cam-
pus, the pay decrease for workers 
and the pay increase for executives 
to show that even though we’re all 
fighting our individual battles, it’s all 
interconnected,” Campos said. “We 
believe Napolitano took a job she 
was unqualified for having no back-
ground in education.”

Campos also stated that the 
Strike Committee would have dem-
onstrations regarding transportation 
issues and Napolitano’s appointment 
throughout the quarter while part-
nering with other student organiza-
tions.

Maintenance workers have been 
protesting at UCSD for higher wages 
and better pensions with the most 
recent demonstration taking place 
last Tuesday, Sept. 24.

Napolitano, who took over after 
Mark Yudof ’s resignation on Sept. 
30, met with Student Regent Cinthia 
Flores, Student Regent-designate 
Sadia Saifuddin, and 10 other desig-
nated students on Oct. 1 to discuss 
their concerns. 

A press release from the University 
of California Office of the President 
stated that the primary purpose of 
the meeting was to discuss UC expe-
riences for both undocumented stu-
dents and students of color.

“The meeting provided an oppor-
tunity for the president to listen, gain 
a first-hand understanding of issues 
important to these students and lay 
the groundwork for cooperation and 
mutual respect going forward,” the 
statement read.

According to the release, Napolitano 
will assign staff members to explore 
the issues the students raised.

The students are not the only 
group to voice their concerns over 

Napolitano’s appointment. State 
Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, 
who represents California’s 80th dis-
trict that encompasses most of south 
San Diego County, penned an open 
letter on Sept. 30 to the new president 
in conjunction with other assembly 
members and state senators.

The letter focuses on the main-
tenance workers that make up the 
majority of UC’s service department.

“Service workers are the only ones 
that have been singled out for a wage 
freeze. These women and men are 
already the lowest-paid UC employ-
ees,” the letter read. “Whatever the 
reason, whatever the recent history, 
singling out the University’s largest 
population of minority workers for 
the harshest treatment at the bargain-
ing table sends a deeply disturbing 
message.”

There’s nothing like ringing 
in the school year with an A.S. 
Council meeting. The pangs of 
hunger as you slowly forego any 
possibilities of dinner. The but-
terflies as you realize that you must 
pay attention at all times, because 
somebody on council will probably 
say something weird that needs 
to be captured in your notes. And 
lastly, the feeling 
of irony as good 
ol’ council starts 
up just as the U.S. 
government shuts 
down.

Council began with public input, 
almost entirely surrounding the 
growing movement to object the 
appointment of UC President Janet 
Napolitano. Representatives from 
organizations including Kaibigang 
Pilipino, SPACES, APSA and SSC 
all spoke on the subject, offering 
personal stories and urging council 
to support the coalition to reject 
Napolitano and the changes that she 
is projected to implement.

“We all have suffered under 
[Napolitano’s] reign as Secretary of 
Homeland Security,” Food Co-op 
Migrant Rights Awareness member 
Juan Campos said. “Everything she’s 
done for our community has been 
hurting us.”

During Special Presentations, 
the trend continued: Students Bruno 
Huizar and Edna Degollado spoke 
about the “No to NapolitaNO” coali-
tion across the UC system, urging 
council to not only pass a “no confi-
dence” resolution toward Napolitano 
but also to join the coalition as a 
whole. 

“I really want to put importance 
[on] that we are living right now 
[with] the most anti-immigrant 
sentiments in history,” Huizar said. 
“We’re not deporting criminals; 

we’re deporting people to make 
money off of them.”

The meeting wasn’t all som-
ber presentations, though. Comic 
relief came in the form of resident 
Australian suspender-wearer Johnny 
Kent, also known as a member of 
A.S. Info Tech Resources. Kent 
took about 10 minutes to start up 
his Prezi — ironic, given that he’s a 

member of IT — 
and proceeded 
to shout “Whee!” 
every time he 
switched to a new 
presentation slide.

I felt like I was on a rollercoaster 
down under.

During Reports of Members, 
council spoke about a variety of dif-
ferent events, including A.S. President 
Andy Buselt’s “Save Graffiti Hall” 
petition and the announcement of a 
special transportation conference.

Then, during question time, 
things took a turn for the worse when 
the members of the Transportation 
Task Force got up from their seats 
and danced around to the song 
“Wheels on the Bus.”

Yes, you read that correctly.
Around 8 p.m., council entered 

an executive session while discuss-
ing the “Resolution Calling for 
the Resignation of Vice-President 
External Affairs Vanessa Garcia for 
Failure to Perform Duties, Improper 
and Unethical Use of Authority, and 
Willful Violation of ASUCSD Rules, 
Regulations, and Procedures.”

I see you haven’t seen through 
with being see-through, council.

Nevertheless, following the ses-
sion, council passed an amended res-
olution as well as one acknowledging 
misunderstandings between Garcia 
and A.S. Council, seemingly mending 
this year’s early-onset tensions.

All’s well that ends well, I guess.

The Fun 
Does Not 
End After 
College

As a senior, transitioning from a carefree San Diego summer back to the daily 
class grind was especially difficult.

Three years ago, I eagerly went 
to every Welcome Week event, 
found all the Stuart Collection art 
pieces, nosed around the spaceship 
library and checked out a concert at 
the Loft all within the first week.

This year, I deleted every wel-
come-back email I was sent (good-
bye, Revelle Infolink), scrolled right 
past the “Meet the Beach” pictures 
littering my News Feed and didn’t 
even bother checking the contents 
of my backpack before heading off 
to my first class.

Yet, countless other seniors 
don’t feel as jaded as I do; instead, 
they feel a sense of panic. Looking 
at all the exuberant and bright-eyed 
freshmen, it’s easy to experience a 
twinge of jealousy. They have the 
next four years to make their mark 
here and do undergraduate life 
right — seniors have already served 
most of their time, through all 
their snoozed alarms and less-than-
stellar midterm grades. 

There’s the notion that you must 
fit in every learning experience by 
the end of your last year of college, 
because afterwards, it will somehow 
be too late. Many soon-to-be grad-
uates feel the sudden urge to get the 
reckless party animal out of their 
systems: to dance on tabletops, get 
kicked out of clubs, kiss beautiful 
strangers, crash theme parties and 
embark on cross-country road trips 
— all in one weekend.

It’s not true, however, that the 
end of college means the conclusion 
of fun times. It won’t quite be the 
same Sun God revelry, but you can 
still have parties at 30. 

When you join the working 
world, you won’t abruptly need to 
turn down the music before mid-
night, and (gasp!) head to bed at a 
reasonable hour. Starting your day 
before 8 a.m. may mean fewer Taco 
Tuesdays and Thirsty Thursdays, 
but you can simply compensate by 
amping up the weekend festivites. 

You might also feel wildly unac-
complished next to your peers who 
have spent summers in the Amazon 
rainforest and are working to find a 
cure for Type II Diabetes, but that 
doesn’t mean that you have to win 
all the prizes during your last year 
here. We’re young and we have so 
much time. 

Even if you didn’t study abroad 
like everyone and their mothers 
did this past summer, the Leaning 
Tower of Pisa will still be there for 
you to take a shameless selfie with 
in the coming decades.

Speaking of pictures, seniors: If 
you don’t have any photos of your 
time here, you need to change that. 
That’s something you can’t go back 
on — you’re going to want a record 
of how you looked in your 20s. 

I possess terrible documentation 
of a monumental time. The only 
images I own from the past few 
years have been stolen from friends’ 
Facebook albums and, more often 
than not, are saturated with awful 
Instagram filters. 

Another note to keep in mind: 
Please get your Undie Run needs 
fulfilled before graduating. The 
general public tends to frown upon 
that sort of behavior.

Three days into new UC 
President Janet Napolitano’s ten-
ure, the only real change for UC 
students is that our afternoons are 
now filled with essays and our bags 
with crumpled-up syllabi. Tuition 
hasn’t shot up, there are no metal 
detectors blocking the entrance to 
Center Hall, nor are UCPD officers 
storming into Hi Thai and round-
ing up students for deportation.

This is in contrast to Napolitano’s 
beginning with the nine-undergrad-
uate-campus system, which was met 
with protests and demand-making 
on campuses statewide. On our 
own campus, Geisel Library was 
dressed in a “No to NapolitaNO” 
banner on Monday.

It is important to consider, before 
you paint your next “Napolitano must 
go” lawn sign, that Napolitano, as the 
first female head of the UC system, 
is doing a very different job than the 
one she had at the beginning of this 
calendar year. Napolitano’s new digs 

will require her to approach her job 
with a different mindset, as the goal 
of running the best university system 
in the country is very different than 
protecting the citizens of the United 
States of America.

Predetermined sentiment toward 
Napolitano as UC president and 
criticism based on her record at the 
Department of Homeland Security is 
unfair, as she hasn’t had a chance to 
demonstrate her plan for the system 
at this point.

This is not to say that there are 
not any marks on her record that are 
concerning. Her tenure at Homeland 
Security left some questions on the 
direction of her leadership. While 
Napolitano is great at identify-
ing her goals (like her support for 
the DREAM Act and a pathway to 
citizenship for undocumented work-
ers), she hasn’t always been able to 
translate those goals to a concrete 
result (as shown by the department’s 
record-setting 400,000-plus deporta-

tions in 2012).
Some marks on her record are 

certainly concerning, though as UC 
chief, Napolitano will need to focus 
on the major issues that affect UC 
students, like affordability, acces-
sibility and diversity — and not, as 
some have suggested she will, “how 
many students can we deport?” In a 
state that now allows undocumented 
students to receive state funding for 
education, it seems that we can safe-
ly assume Napolitano will not work 
to make the UC community more 
exclusive as far as citizenship goes.

The former Arizona governor has 
no formal background in education 
administration, but it is far too soon 
to launch a vote of no confidence 
at her. The search committee that 
selected Napolitano was led by the 
UC Board of Regents, the same body 
that, just this summer, nominated 
UC Berkeley senior Sadia Saifuddin 
as the new student regent-designate.

Both the choices of Saifuddin 

for the student regent job and 
Napolitano for Queen Bee demon-
strate the Board of Regents’ renewed 
efforts to hear more diverse stu-
dent voices at UC headquarters in 
Oakland and strengthen its internal 
administration. Many of the regents 
will be termed out of office in the 
next year or two, and this will pro-
vide the governing board with a 
new opportunity to reevaluate the 
system’s priorities. Napolitano at the 
helm has the potential to help deter-
mine the first steps for achieving the 
UC system’s goals.

Napolitano was never going 
to fix everything in three days, 
and with a relatively light agenda 
for the first few weeks, it will still 
be a while before we see the real 
Napolitano Doctrine.

We should give her a chance to 
be the effective leader she promises 
to be. But should she take the sys-
tem in the wrong direction, we’ll be 
wearing NapolitaNO shirts as well.

The trials and tribulations of freshman year are many. There’s the risk of gain-ing the dorm food-induced Freshman 
15. There’s the new challenge of doing laundry 
— a first for many students — and finding the 
contents of the dryer you claimed dumped 
by an anonymous dorm-mate onto the floor. 
There’s the all-consuming effort to, as you’re 
supposed to in college, “find yourself.” Now 
imagine facing all those challenges with half 
the personal space.

This fall, 300 UCSD freshmen are doing 
exactly that. They have been placed in rooms 
that UCSD’s Housing, Dining, and Hospitality 
services is dubbing “temporary doubles”: a 
room for one redesigned to squeeze in two 
students, outfitted with a set of bunk beds, 
two wardrobes and two desks to be placed 
outside of the room in common space. The 
space allotments, according to a petition on 
Change.org, are 50 square feet per student, 
as opposed to the already-cramped 63.33 feet 
per student in triples.

It’s not like HDH hasn’t tried to fix its mis-
take. Following a petition, HDH lowered the 
price of housing for those in temporary doubles 
by $1,000, and they’ll be lowering it by another 
$1,000 for those who are still in temporary 
doubles next month. They’ve also removed the 
penalty for canceling housing contracts after 
the move-in period. But even though HDH has 
showed a marked effort to make accommoda-

tions for the affected students, the department’s 
housing SNAFU may hurt them in the long 
run. UCSD, as an increasingly lucrative school 
with more applicants every year, will continue 
to face the challenge of enrolling too many stu-
dents without enough housing.

The problem lies primarily in HDH’s eager-
ness to provide all students with on-campus 
living for four years of school. In Fall Quarter 
2012, HDH began to offer a four-year on-cam-
pus housing guarantee to all incoming full-time 
freshman and transfer students. The offer was 
introduced after the completion of a five-year 
housing construction plan that doubled the 
amount of available on-campus residences, but 
the overwhelming demand on the part of stu-
dents has showed that what once seemed like 
plenty of space isn’t cutting it.

The U-T San Diego reported that UCSD 
saw an 8.1-percent increase in admissions com-
pared to last year, and the admitted students 
were more highly qualified than ever before. 
(Last fall alone, we gained 4,573 freshman and 
2,239 transfers.) But judging by the current 
housing crisis, increasing enrollment while 
promising students four years in the dorms isn’t 
a feasible combination — and it’s now become 
clear that the math just doesn’t add up.

To combat the shortage, HDH emailed 
students over the summer, offering an opt-out 
plan that would pay them $2,000 in taxable 
income and $1,000 in dining dollars if they

gave up their housing contract. But 
moving out of the dorms faces a host 
of its own issues. 

While off-campus rent prices are 
much cheaper than the dorms, stu-
dents have no easy way to get to cam-
pus. Most nearby affordable housing 
is located east of the Interstate 5 — 
slightly more than a hop, skip and a 
jump from campus. These students 
must shuttle or drive to campus, 
but Transportation Services’ budget 
crisis has caused complications. The 
UCSD-run Nobel and Arriba shuttles 
could be canceled, and students 
may soon have to pay for MTS bus 
stickers. And the parking shortage 
(finding an S spot on campus is a 
small miracle) coupled with the high 

cost of a daily parking pass has made 
driving to campus a hassle, too.

For freshman and transfer stu-
dents who prefer on-campus liv-
ing, we can only imagine that the 
transition to dorm life has become 
even more traumatic. Thurgood 
Marshall College’s welcome letter 
to new students urged residents to 
have a positive outlook on living in 
closer-than-ever quarters, offering 
that “sometimes we think we aren’t 
going to like something until we try 
it out.” Nearly every single room 
in Marshall has been changed into 
a temporary double, and in Muir, 
storage rooms have been converted 
into temporary dorms.

Administration seems to hope 
that enough students will flee 
the dorms to make room for the 

students currently in temporary 
housing. And although enough may 
leave to remedy the crowding, the 
difficult transition to housing may 
prove to take an emotional toll on 
students as they adjust to school in 
an even more turbulent environ-
ment than usual.

The simple truth is that UCSD 
is just congested. With many ser-
vices underfunded and overcrowd-
ed, it seems like the university just 
can’t continue to make promises 
it either fails to keep or keeps in 
condition-heavy ways. However 
HDH chooses to meet the housing 
shortage, it has to do it quickly and 
find a long-term solution, instead 
of cutting corners and making stu-
dents’ transition to college far more 
stressful than it needs to be.

Housing Opt-Out Plan Does Not Address Transportation Issues

Dear Editor,
I have been reading and listening 

to arguments about how the gassing of 
the Syrian people should be equated 
to American abortion. This argument 
seems to lead into whether we should 
attack Syria, leave Syria alone after 
killing approximately 1,400 of their 
own people and whether or not this 
should be the ideal time to look at our 
own country’s abortion laws.

First, it has been established that 
Syria has broken international law 
by gassing their own people in this 
civil war that has been going on for 
two years. All of the world’s coun-
tries know about this, but only very 
few will agree to take a stand against 
this. Our president and Congress 
seem ready to stand with these few 
countries in order to “punish” the 
Syrian government. At this point, our 
government leaders are like salmon 
swimming up stream on this. The 
overwhelming majority of Americans 
do not want anything to do with Syria. 
Who said government officials have it 

easy? Not this decision.
As for equating abortion to this, I 

can say many, many people are against 
abortion! I am a Democrat, but that 
doesn’t mean I can’t be pro-life. I was 
recently given an Internet link to a 
picture of a 10-week-old aborted fetus. 
If anyone could still believe in abor-
tion after seeing this picture, I say 
God help them! At this point in our 
legal system, there is very little pro-
lifers can do other than use the power 
of the pen, Internet, phone, snail-mail, 
voting booth and public forums in 
order to say, “NO MORE!”

Setting  
the Scene

A car. An elevator. A basement. A facilities plant.
None of these are typically associated with art to the say the 

least: At best, they’re much too mundane and at worst, completely 
devoid of any opportunities for artistic inspiration. To decide to 
create and perform art outside of the studio or the auditorium 
takes quite a bit of bravery — and nothing short of brilliance. But 
that will be accomplished this weekend through the formidably 
innovative teamwork of UCSD’s department of theatre and dance, 
the La Jolla Playhouse and the Museum of Contemporary Art San 
Diego. In the Without Walls Festival, which is one of the few site-
specific art festivals in North America, UCSD’s own professors 
and students will be performing from Oct. 3 to Oct. 6 in a range 
of spectacles including dance performances, installations and 
recreations of classic plays.

“It’s an interesting challenge to perform in these kinds of 
spaces where the audience is always really close,” Department 
Chair of Theatre and Dance Jim Carmody said. “This is a very 
intimate experience for the audience. [In] some cases, they’re 
standing right next to the performer. There is no divide, there is 
no proscenium arch, there’s no orchestra pit, there’s no physical 
barrier. The audience is right there, and that’s exciting. It’s high-
risk, but it’s exciting.”

Nonetheless, the WoW Festival performances will be well 
worth that risk. La Jolla’s artists will (quite literally) stretch the 
boundaries of art with works spanning a broad spectrum of cre-
ativity. The festival will include such standouts as “Cornerstone,” 
a comedic but philosophical play about a sandwich that gets eaten 
for lunch at the Central Facilities Plant; “A Willow Grows Aslant,” 
an exploration of Shakespeare’s Ophelia through the use of plants 
in the basement of Galbraith Hall; and “Hedda’ing,” a choreo-
graphed dance based on Henrik Ibsen’s play “Hebba Gabler” atop 
Jacobs Hall’s “Fallen Star.”

Carmody also cited UCSD alumnus and lecturer Tom 
Dugdale’s production of Thornton Wilder’s “Our Town,” which 
will be performed in the backyard of the Weiss Forum and will 
star many of UCSD’s recent graduates, as “a kind of special alumni 

homecoming event.”
“[The WoW festival has] given our students an opportunity 

to write and create completely new work just for spaces in and 
around our building,” said Carmody.

The department of theater and dance is also looking forward 
to the opportunities the WoW Festival is offering UCSD in fur-
thering its half-century-long relationship with the internationally 
renowned La Jolla Playhouse, founded by Academy Award win-
ner Gregory Peck, Mel Ferrer and Dorothy McGuire.

“We’re very closely intertwined with [the La Jolla Playhouse] 
in all kinds of ways and so doing this together was a natural thing 
to do,” Carmody said. “This is the first time we’ve actually gotten 
together and produced a large event together … It’s hard to imag-
ine us being more closely combined than we are now. This level of 
collaboration is pretty unprecedented in the country … San Diego 
is a pretty ideal place to [hold a festival like this]. It’s a great place 
to make art. And I think it’s a great place to experience art as well.”

Sam Mitchell, a dancer and choreographer for the piece 
“Hedda’ing” and a second-year MFA student in theatre and dance, 
couldn’t agree more about the positive impacts that the UCSD-La 
Jolla Playhouse relationship has had for the WoW Festival.

“I just found an incredible amount of support through the 
department [and] people wanting to support ideas,” Mitchell said. 
“[The La Jolla Playhouse has] been such an integral part of my 
experience here in San Diego … It’s a big draw for me, coming 
in and wanting to be involved with people whom I also share [an 
artistic] vision with.”

Together with Ph.D. student Jason Dorwart and Norwegian 
dancers Siri Jontvedt and Snelle Hall, Mitchell will be exhibiting 
a dance based on Henrik Ibsen’s classic “Hedda Gabler” inside 
and outside the Stuart Collection’s latest — and perhaps most 
marveled at — addition “Fallen Star.” Mitchell is no stranger to 
performing site-specific dance in conjunction with the Stuart 
Collection’s works, as he previously worked with a trio of danc-
ers in choreographing and performing a routine around and on 
Warren College’s “Bear.” With Mitchell’s enthusiasm for and inter-

est in “Fallen Star,” “Hedda’ing” will be UCSD’s strongest presence 
at the WoW Festival. 

“In my very first year as a grad student, I saw the ‘Fallen Star’ 
sculpture, and I immediately was just stricken by it,” Mitchell said. 
“I was just inspired, [and I] wanted to do a performance somehow 
connected to that particular sculpture … It’s so powerful to just 
be there in the house, and watch and feel a little bit off-kilter … 
It really feels like it’s so much a part of my body now. I have this 
connection, and I think that’s really important with site-specific 
work.”

With his background in both visual arts and dance, Mitchell 
also hinted that “Hedda’ing” will explore his own heritage as a 
Yaqui Indian.

“[I’ve talked] about this idea of being connected to something 
… feeling outside of the periphery … I think we’ve all experienced 
that. And that’s one of the themes we’re exploring in this piece, 
because it’s something that we can all relate to — this feeling of 
wanting to belong and then the feeling of not belonging and also 
the feeling of setting oneself apart,” Mitchell said.

“[A friend of mine once told me,] ‘You have the unique 
perspective, so in anything that you make, in some ways you’re 
already addressing those issues. So make them work … and then 
people will see the work and it will resonate in a certain way.’”

With the diversity of artistic visions presented this weekend, 
the Without Walls Festival promises a bright beginning for not 
only its future developments but also the institutions involved 
and the individual artists who will showcase their creative genius 
in unconventional ways.

“This is really an experiential thing,” Carmody said. “You go, 
you experience it — there’s no right way or wrong way to do it. It 
doesn’t require prior training. It doesn’t require preparation. You 
go, you participate, you share, you enjoy and that’s really all you 
need.”

Sports like Formula One racing 
seem in a lot of ways more exciting 
and hair-raising for their participants 
than those watching in the stands: 
The drivers are essentially strapped to 
bombs racing in circles. The new film 
“Rush” turns on the fact that racers 
have to be at least a little bit foolhardy, 
a little bit full of themselves.

This pulse-pounding film, Ron 
Howard’s (“Apollo 13,” “A Beautiful 
Mind”) latest, follows the real-life 
rivalry between Formula One drivers 
James Hunt and Niki Lauda. These 
two drivers are destined for conflict 
from the start; as we find out early 
in the film, they both have the same 
dream — to become World Champion 
of Formula One — but incredibly dif-
ferent approaches and styles. Hunt, 
played exceedingly well by Chris 
Hemsworth (“Thor,” “The Avengers”), 
is driven by what seems like a twisted 

sense of joi de vivre. He plunges into 
racing wholeheartedly, his passion 
fueling his success, fully accepting his 
nearness to death. He throws himself 
at life just as readily off the track, be it 
with women, drink, women, drugs or 
women. He’s impossible for his team 
managers to control, both volatile and 
irrepressible — but when it comes to 
the race, he doesn’t mess around.

Lauda, played in an equally arrest-
ing performance by Daniel Bruhl 
(“Inglourious Basterds,” “Good Bye 
Lenin!”) is nearly the opposite. Not 
as ruggedly handsome or daring as 
Hunt, he isn’t particularly good with 
people, but he likes it that way. He 
focuses on winning, on how to perfect 

his car and on simply being the best 
technical racer that he can be. He 
buys his way into Formula One, and 
to the chagrin of someone like Hunt, 
proves that he’s incredibly talented at 
the same time.

With such opposing philosophies, 
it’s inevitable that the two will clash. 
When they do, it is explosive — their 
personalities leap off the screen, and 
their races are pounding affairs of 
metal, combustion and raw power. 
“Rush” has succeeded more fully 
than perhaps any other racing film in 
recent memory at putting the viewer 
in the driver’s seat. Howard throws 
in shots that are stunning in many 
ways: from inside the helmet, claus-

trophobic and oppressive, all the way 
to inside the engine itself, peeking at 
the pumping of the machinery and 
the flame of the reaction. The action 
is only exacerbated by the personal 
stakes of the leading men.

The film operates much like a race 
car itself — supremely efficient, firing 
off dramatic scene after scene. Every 
scene fits into the larger picture per-
fectly, and no time is wasted. In fact, 
if there is any complaint to be levied 
against the film, it could be that it 
doesn’t let up once. The film has very 
little downtime, and when it does it is 
usually full of character revelations, 
poignant moments or steamy passion. 
There is no time to get up and refill on 

popcorn, and that could very well be a 
good thing.

Perhaps most impressively, 
Howard takes two fairly unlikable 
characters (it is pointed out many 
times within the film that they are 
both, without a doubt, “assholes”) and 
manages to get the audience to root 
and sympathize with them by the end. 
Both characters find intriguing and 
very different love interests that are 
the vehicle for this transition. Suzy 
Miller, played by Olivia Wilde (“Tron 
Legacy,” “House M.D.”), forces Hunt 
to struggle with his maturity and com-
mitment to his passion. Lauda’s

" n order to understand Janelle Monae, you have to step foot into the cyber-dystopian era she 
has created, first in 2010’s “The 
ArchAndroid” and now with “The 
Electric Lady”. The loose narrative 
that weaves throughout each of the 
tracks on “Electric” paints a picture of 
Monae as an android learning to be 
human and deconstructing the very 
meaning of humanity at the same 
time. Her soundtrack is influenced 
by a wide variety of genres, from soul 
to funk to electronica, and is always 
dazzling. Crisp percussion makes the 
beats hit you with force, and Monae’s 
choice of guitars and synthesizers pop 
against her equally vivid vocals.

With “Electric”’s lead single 

“Q.U.E.E.N.,” Monae hits us with an 
unapologetically funky track that 
impossibly makes you contemplate 
societal issues of classism and poverty 
while getting down to the beat. “Will 
you be electric sheep?” she demands. 
“Electric ladies, will you sleep/ Or will 
you preach?” Monae’s rap verse on 
this track as well is both impressive in 
terms of flow and authoritative, her 
voice unwavering and dire.

The album’s bookend, “What an 
Experience,” is a ballad that evokes 
‘80s synth-pop and has one of the 
most melodically catchy hooks on 
the album. The track then slows to a 
head-bobbing, reggae tempo. Janelle’s 
skilled singing and reflection of a 
love that will last “until the sky don’t 

shine” fill the song with heart. Monae 
is capable of developing an intimate 
relationship with her audience, and 
her genuine, relatable lyrics create 
even more of an allure.

Janelle Monae’s “Archandroid” is 
evolving with each new album. This 
newest effort is a testament to her 
emotional growth as an artist and as 
a staple of contemporary R&B. The 
album showcases her confident voice 
and talent as an experienced song-
writer. “The Electric Lady” invites us 
into her own vivid, eccentric world, 
and we’re all the funkier for it.

Excellent production and budding musicality are 
muddled by vocal inconsistencies.

E resh from his very first Grammy award, Drake offers two different versions of cover 
art on his third studio album, 
“Nothing Was the Same” — one a 
profile of the Canadian rapper as 
he appears today, the other a comi-
cally afro-ed infant (complete with 
pick) that we can only assume is 
supposed to be baby Drake. The 
album itself follows this past-pres-
ent juxtaposition, exploring Drake’s 
current success and the work 
behind it all. This kind of duality 
can be tricky footing, and the result 
is an album that never quite finds 
solid ground.

Utilizing at least 15 credited 
producers, “Nothing Was the Same” 
has an expansive sonic palette, 
augmenting the standard hip-hop 
fare with R&B, funk, pop and blues. 
The more straightforward offerings 
(“Own It,” “Worst Behavior”) bring 
small doses of these styles to the 
table, giving the album a refreshing 
musicality while still maintaining 
Drake’s distinctive energy. Other 
tracks rework his sound entirely. 
The soft keening notes of “Furthest 
Thing” slip in and out of a scratch-
ing backbeat, building and warp-
ing until they flare out into an 
old-school, hip-hop strut. Subtle 
evolution like this lends a forward 
momentum to “Nothing Was the 
Same” and allows longer songs to 
develop thematically.  

Regrettably, Drake’s measured 
wordplay doesn’t keep pace with 
the intricate production. Each new 
musical idea is treated with the 
same laid-back flow, and against 
a flood of melodic interplay, it’s 
all he can do to stay afloat. The 
struggle is apparent from the 
get-go, as intro “Tuscan Leather” 
finds Drake treading hard water 
with cumbersome lines: “Comin’ 
off the last record, I’m getting 20 
million off the record/ Just to off 
these wreckers, that’s a record.” 
This overall awkwardness is exac-
erbated by Drake’s guest artists, 
who either disappear too soon or 
steal the spotlight entirely. Features 
like these would be better used 
as a moderate addition to each 
new track instead of the stylistic 
crapshoot to which they have been 
reduced. 

With a foot firmly planted in 
each period of his life, it’s little 
wonder that “Nothing Was the 
Same” finds Drake at his most 
ungainly. The release leans com-
fortably forward into more mature 
musical territory, only to be 
wrenched back by a rather ado-
lescent inability to express itself.       
In a word, the album seems dispa-
rate; in two, it feels more like grow-
ing pains.

wife Marlene (Alexandra Lara, 
“Downfall”), on the other hand, gives 
Lauda an incredibly human and vul-
nerable side that the audience doesn’t 
see elsewhere in the film. “Happiness 
is the enemy,” he confesses on their 
honeymoon, and we wonder whom 
he is trying to convince.

“Rush” succeeds precisely because 
it is not just a sports film. Lauda and 
Hunt join many other excellent film 
and book adversaries that are incred-
ibly engaging to watch because of the 

way they impact each other, from 
Holmes and Moriarty to Valjean and 
Javert. It is clear that they are not 
wholly enemies — their relationship 
is far from simple. They are defined 
and motivated by each other; they 
are rivals, but they understand each 
other better than anyone else pos-
sibly could.

“Rush” is a truly great and engag-
ing film and an incredible character 
study. It brings enormous production 
quality and immediacy to the world 
of Lauda and Hunt, from the stun-
ning sound design to the Academy-

Award-deserving cinematography. It 
is dynamic not only in its portrayal of 
two incredibly interesting and larger-
than-life men but in the way it puts 
the audience in the driver’s seat for 
some of the most hair-raising racing 
put on film. Go see “Rush,” even if 
you’re not partial to racing movies. 
The film succeeds far beyond expec-
tations, and aside from some minor 
quibbles about pacing, is not to be 
missed. It’s one heck of a ride.

Interfraternity Council
F raternities were founded in American universities for the purpose of developing and broadening the academic faculties of their members while at the same time providing a sense of brotherhood and bonding that did not exist inside of the 
classroom. Since then, they have developed into so much more.

First and foremost, for almost every fraternity, is academics. Fraternities are made 
up of students, and students come to college with the intention to study. Many chapters 
within the IFC thus reward their members for high academic performance and encour-
age a certain GPA for all members.

Fraternities proudly work to not only make a lasting positive impact in the lives of 
their members, but also in their community. Last year, IFC fraternities at UCSD vol-
unteered more than 4,100 hours of community service and were also able to raise over 
$9,000 that was donated to local and national philanthropic causes. It is the leadership 
that is learned and honed in fraternities that makes these events possible and these 
skills translate to everyday life.

The Interfraternity Council works to enhance the sense of community between the 
various fraternities and enables them to work together more readily. This allows for 
collaboration and innovation that would not be possible if each fraternity was working 
completely independently. IFC’s goal is enhance the fraternity experience and to ensure 
that we, as a community, are always getting better. We often work with other Greek 
organizations on campus to put on collaborative, educational and fun events that can 
help create and improve the sense of community on campus.

Fraternities are improving in many areas — academics, community service, phil-
anthropic giving, creating and enabling leaders and reaching out to new areas of the 
UCSD community —, and I firmly believe that the best days of fraternities here at 
UCSD are ahead of us.

- Timothy Sirota, Interfraternity Council President

Panhellenic Council
W ith many varying organizations on campus, the Panhellenic Council can be caught up in the mix. Technically, Panhellenic is the community comprised of the ten sororities that belong to the National Panhellenic Conference. On a deeper level, 
Panhellenic is a home away from home to almost a thousand women at UCSD and a life 
changing, life long experience for every individual member. 

Although the media has tainted perceptions of Greeks, those who truly look at UCSD 
Greek life see that it’s a thing of its own. Negative press covers the worst of sororities with 
reports of racism, sexism, hazing, etc. At UCSD, the Panhellenic community works to not 
only dispel overarching negative traits that come with Greek life but eradicate them. We 
have a no-tolerance, anti-hazing policy, seminars on sexual assault and leadership confer-
ences on diversity, and we strive everyday to break stereotypes by simply being the best 
version of ourselves in letters. 

Sororities were founded as support and encouragement for women in a male-dominat-
ed college world. Centuries later, they continue to serve as a tenant for scholarship, service 
and individual growth while giving women common values to bond with one another. 
Sisterhood is a lot of things, but at the core it is finding people who will be your best 
friends, empower you and help you grow into whoever you want to be.

Every Panhellenic chapter has a national charity organization they raise money and 
awareness for all year. Ranging from a carnival to a dance competition, the philanthropy 
events raise thousands of dollars each. The biggest opportunity you get from being a part 
of Panhellenic, aside from spending your time in meaningful ways, is the opportunity to 
learn from others who want to get the most out of college just as much as you do. Part of 
the largest, most diverse block of females on campus, Panhellenic members meet, integrate 
with and are inspired by women from all walks of life. We take that collective power and 
try better our school, the world and one another to the fullest of our capacity. 

- Leah Wong, Panhellenic Council President

Alpha Phi Omega
A lpha Phi Omega is a national co-ed fraternity focused on community service. At UCSD, we are classifed under the Professional Fraternity Council due to our 
focus on professionalism and service to the chapter, campus, 
community and country. This is not to be confused with the 
fraternities and sororities in the IFC, PHC or MGC.

Our reputation varies from person-to-person, but a general 
consensus is that APO is a very large fraternity. Some people 
may not take our fraternity seriously due to the fact that we 
accept everyone who wants to join, but APO is proud to have 
such a large member base. Our belief is that we should not 
refuse anyone who wants to provide service to the community, 
so every recruitment quarter, we accept around 30 to 100 new 
members. It is easy for others to doubt the strength of our 
brotherhood, but with every large group comes a diverse pool 
of personalities and opportunities. The potential of APO is 
limitless because of our room to grow. Most people join with 
little history of extracurricular activities and leadership experi-
ence, but leave with countless lifelong friends and knowledge 
of how to be the type of leader that suits their personality. 
We welcome everyone to fully utilize APO’s opportunities in 
our three cardinal principles of Leadership, Friendship and 
Service.

Not only do we help our campus with activities like Roger’s 
Community Garden, but we also reach out to the San Diego 
community by helping out the senior citizens, youth, home-
less community and environment. Our largest service project 
is Operation Santa, in which we provide San Diego families in 
need with holiday gifts of basic necessities and toys. This proj-
ect in particular is open to anyone, affiliated or not, who wants 
to directly help a family in need by adopting a family’s wish-
list, individually or with a group of friends. The bigger picture 
of Alpha Phi Omega’s mission is not to be an exclusive group 
of people with a common interest but to benefit and give back 
to the community, and we encourage everyone to do the same.

-  Kelly Wong, Alpha Phi Omega Ro Phi Chapter President

Multi-Cultural Greek Council
T he Multicultural Greek Council is one of three Greek councils at UCSD. It is composed of 15 Greek fraternities and sororities that stand 
unified to promote higher education and leadership 
with the added aspect of a cultural identity. The IFC 
and PHC are long-standing establishments, while the 
MGC is a growing, but somewhat under-the-radar 
force. Over the years, the UCSD MGC has cultivated a 
small close-knit community with many of its founders 
remaining local,  creating a viable network of connec-
tions. The MGC’s role at UCSD is especially important 
given the great diversity of students on campus. MGC 
strives to serve the community with an emphasis on 
distinct cultures and is inclusive of all students, which 
means that students who may not identify with a par-
ticular interest may still join. First and foremost, the 
MGC embodies the ideal of knowing yourself and liv-
ing confidently in who you are.

- Kaylee Miu, Multi-Cultural Greek Council 
Vice President

Alpha Kappa Psi
F ounded in 1904, Alpha Kappa Psi is the oldest and largest co-ed business fraternity. AKPsi is a group of students who share a common interest in profes-
sional development and proactively pursuing the career of our 
dreams. The Nu Xi Chapter at UCSD has over 60 members 
whose diversity in majors is unified with the individual success 
of each member.

Though it is commonly known that proficiency in resume 
building, interviews, public speaking and networking are great 
assets for any college student, a fair portion of the UCSD com-
munity is unaware that ΑΚPsi can assist with all of this. As an 
organization that is open to all majors, we have a huge network 
of actives and alumni working at companies such as Microsoft, 
P&G and Disney. By providing our members with work-
shops and mentorship programs, as well as a multitude of job 
opportunities and valuable leadership experience, our chapter 
encourages each individual’s professional development. 

As a fraternity, we hope to be perceived as a professional 
resource for the student body. We co-host recruiting events 
with companies, provide seminars and workshops on resumes 
and interviews and arrange many other events geared towards 
enabling the professional development of UCSD students. Like 
social fraternities and sororities, we engage in many social 
activities, including quarterly retreats, barbeques, day outings, 
inter-chapter mixers, intramural sports tournaments and much 
more. What separates us is our unifying desire to develop our-
selves professionally. Whether those interests lie within optom-
etry, investment banking, public policy or otherwise, all our 
brothers make an active effort to further our offerings.

- Cathy Kim, Alpha Kappa Psi Nu Xi Chapter Rush Coordinator

This recipe is quick, easy to make and a great way to meet the hurdle of cooking in a 
cramped on-campus setting. Not 
to mention the sauce is creamy and 
delicious — it tastes far more sophis-
ticated than it is.

Start by boiling a pot of water. 
While that’s heating up, start making 
the avocado sauce. Cut the avocado 
in half. Store the half that isn’t already 
designated for the sauce in the fridge 
for another time, or add it to make a 
thicker sauce. Chop about six leaves 
of basil, mince the garlic cloves, and 
mix them together vigorously. One to 
two cloves of garlic will probably be 
more than adequate, but garlic fiends 
can add a third. Add half of the total 
avocado amount, and mix until the 
ingredients form a paste. You can also 

use a blender for these steps, though 
you don’t have to — the back of a 
spoon can do the job as well. Add in 
the olive oil, the lemon juice and the 
remainder of the avocado if you’d like. 
Continue to mix until the texture is 
even throughout.

Once the water reaches a boil, put 
the pasta in to cook. For one person, a 
serving is a handful of raw pasta that, 
when held between the first finger 
and thumb, is about the diameter of a 
quarter. If you use angel hair instead 
of spaghetti, add a few drops of olive 
oil so the noodles don’t stick together 
while they’re cooking. Angel hair 
takes about four minutes to cook to 
an “al dente” state, which will give it a 
slightly chewy but firm bite. Spaghetti 
will take slightly longer. Test the 
noodles while they’re cooking to make 
sure they are not getting too saturated 
or staying too dry. Once the pasta is 

boiled to your taste, drain it and rinse 
it with cold water to stop the cooking.

Drain the pasta, spoon it into 
two bowls and pour the avocado 
sauce over it. Mix thoroughly. Add 
any salt or pepper, garnish with basil, 
and enjoy! This is a dish best served 
immediately, since the avocado in the 
sauce will start to brown if it’s left out 

for too long. This is a good, simple 
dish for closing out the summer 
season. Plus, it doesn’t take too long 
to make, so it’s perfect for a college 
student in a hurry who still wants a 
home-cooked meal.

October is National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, when nonprofits, busi-
nesses and ordinary people alike 
come together to support those who 
have been affected by breast cancer. 
Buying a wedding gown is one of the 
most unique ways you can help fund 
programs for breast cancer patients. 
Brides Against Breast Cancer is a 
nonprofit organization that sells gen-
tly worn, donated wedding gowns 
with the proceeds going to families 
affected by breast cancer. UCSD stu-

dents may find interest in an event 
like this if they are studying sciences 
and want to see an excellent aspect 
of cancer funding. Marriage may 
not be in sight for many undergrads 
— or even graduate students — but 
current students can get involved 
with the organization by volunteer-
ing their time or attending the 
event and speaking to those who 
are directly involved in the lives of 
people with breast cancer. BABC is 
currently holding its “Nationwide 
Tour of Gowns,” a traveling bridal 
show, at the San Diego Marriott La 
Jolla from Oct. 5 to Oct. 6. 

Wedding gown prices range 
from $99 to $3,900, with the aver-
age gown costing $600. They are 
available in sizes 4 to 18. Check 
out the gowns early at the VIP 
event, “Unveiling of the Gowns,” on 
Saturday from 6 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. 
Admission to the VIP event is a 
tax-deductible donation of $20. VIP 
attendees will enjoy entertainment 
and giveaways. General admission 
is Sunday, Oct. 5 from 11 a.m. to 
4 p.m. and costs $5. BABC also 
offers a layaway policy. To attend 
the “Nationwide Tour of Gowns,” 
you must register at their website. 

With over $2 million raised annu-
ally at these events, Brides Against 
Breast Cancer provides an excellent 
opportunity for UCSD students to 
get a new perspective on cancer 

programs and research and to make 
a positive impact.

Bagheri buried a free kick from 25 
yards out, the momentum swung in 
favor of the Tritons.

UCSD recorded 10 more attempts 
in the second half, including five from 
van Zyll, who came in off the bench.

“It was a game between two good 
teams, and I think the game reflected 
that,” Pascale said. “They had their 
spells where they were getting at us, 
and we had our spells where we were 
getting at them, and we were fortunate 

to get a goal.”
The Tritons head back on the road 

to face Cal State Stanislaus — last 
season’s CCAA tournament champion 
— and Cal State East Bay this weekend. 

Despite Stanislaus’ 3-4-1 record, 
Pascale expects a difficult match from 
the Warriors. 

“Stanislaus is a little bit better than 
their results, so we’re excited to get out 
there and get after them,” he said.

them,” UCSD head coach Brian 
McManus said. “The kids are going 
to learn. Every week we’re learning, 
we knew we were gonna be growing 
every week.”

The Tritons, who graduated a large 
senior class, have been scrutinized for 
youth, but their freshmen seem to be 
coming into form.

Among the best is freshman for-
ward Jamie Benedetto, a prospect who 
has delivered for UCSD. Last Friday 
against Humboldt State, Benedetto 

scored UCSD’s only goal in the Tritons’ 
1–1 tie.

When asked about her recent suc-
cess, Benedetto said time on the field 
has helped.

“Every game is helping with experi-
ence,” Benedetto said. “I knew that as a 
soon as I could get one goal, it might 
give me confidence for more, and I 
scored last weekend. My team gives me 
perfect passes.”

Although it has two losses and three 
ties and has fallen out of the national 
rankings, UCSD is still in second place 
in the CCAA South Division. UCSD 

is two games behind South Division 
leader San Bernardino State and just 
one point ahead of three CCAA teams, 
all of which have two conference wins.

This Friday, UCSD faces top-of-
the-conference Cal State Stanislaus on 
the road. The Warriors are currently 
ranked No. 9 in the national standings 
and are undefeated in the season thus 
far (7-0-1).

The following Sunday, the Tritons 
take on Cal State East Bay (2–6).

For the first time in recent memory, the UCSD men’s soccer team sits atop of the table of the CCAA 
South Division.

Recording its fourth straight win, the 
No. 10 nationally ranked Tritons (6-1-1 
overall, 4-1-1 in conference) won both of 
its weekend matches. 

UCSD head coach Jon Pascale seems 
to have struck upon a formula — one 
that combines a back line that has only 
allowed two goals in eight games, the 
energy of new attackers and a focus on 
set pieces — that has yielded impressive 
dividends.

Last Friday, the Tritons defeated 
Humboldt State 2–0. UCSD’s first goal 
came late in the first half from senior 
midfielder Cory Wolfrom, who finished 
the ball inside the 16-yard box. The sec-
ond goal came courtesy of junior transfer 
Alessandro Canale — recently returned 
from the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup 
— who collected on a cross from fresh-
man Gerrit van Zyll and slotted the ball 

low in the corner.
Pascale spoke highly of new attackers 

Canale and van Zyll, noting that the two 
have given the Tritons some edge in the 
attacking third.

“Having Alessandro Canale back 
has been great — he brings a different 
dimension to the team, and van Zyll 
has really played himself into the mix,” 
Pascale said.

Senior All-American Josh Cohen was 
tasked to make five saves in the shutout 
match.

The following Sunday, Cohen again 
figured prominently in the Tritons’ 1–0 
win over Sonoma State. The goalkeeper 
was only credited for two saves, but 
battled in the air to intercept Sonoma 
crosses throughout the match.

Sonoma, a school with a long history 
of strong soccer teams, appeared to be 
the dominant squad from the whistle, 
but after senior midfielder Andisheh

MEN'S  BASKETBALL

Former UCSD men’s basket-
ball assistant coach Eric Olen will 
take over as head coach to replace 
Chris Carlson, it was announced last 
Tuesday, Oct. 1.

Olen has spent the past nine sea-
sons as an assistant coach at UCSD, 
after playing four years of NAIA 
basketball at Spring Hill College in 
Mobile, Ala.

“I’m really excited about the 
opportunity and feel really fortunate 
to inherit a great group of student-
athletes,” Olen said. “I’m really look-
ing forward to this upcoming season.”

Olen will take over for Carlson, 
who spent five seasons at UCSD after 
serving as the director of basketball 
relations for Ben Howland at UCLA. 

Carlson leaves with an overall 
record of 75–89 (.457) over his six 
seasons with the Tritons and after 
taking the team to the NCAA tourna-
ment in 2008.

When asked, Carlson had noth-
ing but good things to say about 
former assistant coach Olen.

“He’s very talented and has great 
insight into the game,” Carlson said. 
“He’s very thorough and very pas-
sionate and has a great love for 
UCSD.”

A San Diego native, Carlson 
leaves his post for a job as the 
associate commissioner for men’s 
basketball of the West Coast 
Conference — a NCAA Division-I 
conference hosting teams including 
Southern California schools Loyola 
Marymount University, Pepperdine 
University and University of San 
Diego. He will be stationed in San 
Francisco.

Carlson says he’s excited for the 

new job but also finds it hard to 
leave UCSD.

“There’s so much to love about 
UCSD, but it was a tough opportu-
nity to turn down,” Carlson said.

The UCSD men’s basketball team 
has limped through its last two 
seasons. In 2011, the Tritons went 
11–17 and last season UCSD fin-
ished with an 11–15 record.

The Tritons will begin 2013 with-
out their top scorer, Tyler McGrath, 
as well as starting forward Justin 
Brue, who both graduated last 
spring. Needless to say, Olen will 

have his work cut out for him in his 
inaugural season, but the former 
assistant coach is optimistic.

“We did lose a lot of seniors, but 
we’re excited with this group’s talent 
and work ethic,” Olen said. “We’re 
younger, but I think we have enor-
mous potential.”

Olen says he is in the process of 
looking for another assistant coach 
to join the staff before practice 
begins in a couple weeks.

Last Sunday, the UCSD women’s 
soccer team conceded its first confer-
ence loss of the season to Sonoma 
State.

With four minutes left and the 
score tied 2–2, Sonoma midfielder 
Margi Osmundson was fed in front of 
the mouth of the goal to beat sopho-
more goalkeeper Kelcie Brodsky and 
take the 3–2 win.

UCSD took an early lead against 
the Seawolves with a goal by fresh-
man forward Jamie Benedetto, who 
finished a cross from redshirt fresh-
man Kiera Bocchino. Osmundson 

made her first goal of the game to tie 
the score six minutes later. Sonoma 
pulled ahead on a penalty kick grant-
ed for a UCSD handball before the 
end of the first half.

Benedetto scored her second goal 
midway into the second half, and it 
seemed as if the Tritons would slot 
a third — outshooting the Seawolves 
8–4 in the second period — before 
Osmundson picked up the go-ahead 
goal.

“That’s the best Sonoma team 
they’ve had since we’ve been in 
Division II, and we can play with
