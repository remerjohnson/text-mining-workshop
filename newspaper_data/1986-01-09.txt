Digging for federal aid 
With recent and impending cuts in federal financial aid, student loans are hard 
to come by, and grants harder still. The Reagan Administration proposes further 
cuts and limits on who may receive aid. Yet, for the first time, Congress has 
sought out student input and may implement a bill written by a committee of 
students from around the country. If passed, the proposal could simplify the 
application process and provide more aid to more students. Why can't Johnny 
pay his fees? See story, page 3.

affect the elderly. 

"We are convinced that

says the solar system orignated, 
not from a fiery explosion, but 
from a universe composed 
primarily of cosmic plasmas. , 

"Our present knowledge of 
COrnslC plamas makes it pOSSIble 
to reconstruct those events of 4 
bllhon to 5 billion years ago 
which resulted in the formation 
of the solar system," Alfven said. 

The Swedish physicist, who 
divides his time between UCSD 
and the Royal Institute of 
Technology lt1 Stockholm, 
presented his finding in a paper 
dehvered Dec. 13 at the annual 
meeting of the American 
Geophysical Union in San 
Francisco. 

SCIentists are VIewing the 
cosmic envIronment differently 
than they did 10 years ago 
because of recent dramatlc 
advances in the understandmg 
of the properties of cosmic 
plasmas, accordmg to Alfven "To

AS PreSIdent Mary Rose Alexallder speafls out 

Media vote delayed 
By CHRISTINE HUEBER, Stall Wntrr 

After a show of hands 
Wednesday nighr, the AS voted 
to postpone the voting on the 
controversial alternative media 
funding proposal until their 
meeting next week. 

Communications 
CommIssioner Michael 
Fahllbusch introduced a revised 
edition of his original proposal, 
sta ting that "( the proposal) 
wasn't written in proper form to 
be passed as a Bylaw." Formerly 
"non-binding," said Fahllbuseh, 
rbe reVised form is worded so 
tbat the "new Communications 
Commissioner will have to 
adhere to it." 

The proposal hasn't been 
changed at all, Fahllbuscb said , 
but by postponing the vote it will 
allow more time for the 
alternative media to come up 
with another recommendation. 

Jill Lifschitz, Financial Vice 
President, stated, "( there is) a 
need for a change , ... (i t) must 
be done thoroughly." 

External-Affairs Vice President 
Greg Arnold felt it is the 
"obligation of the media to show 
more initiatlve," since a meeting 
held by the alternative media 
over Christmas vacation to 
diSCUSS the proposed cb(1Oges 10 
funding had a poor tumour. 

John Riley, MUir Collj!ge 
Representative, suggested talking 
to the students about the 
proposal, and placlt1g it on the 
Spring Ballot as a referendum. 

The AS also voted to allocate 
$0 funding to the La jolla Forum, 
a pro pective campus newspaper 
which hopes to gain AS support.

tbe small fundlt1g rescrvc for thc

pOSSibilit ies of "creatlve

AS matching funds raised by the 
La jolla Forum through 
advertising, or the AS would 
simply underwrite their first 
Issue . 

Later in the meeting, Enc 
Weiss, Third College 
Representative, brougbt up the 
Minors Rights to Abortion 
resolution currently in the tate 
legislature, and expressed his 
bope that the AS would pass a 
resolution opposing the bill. In

reach out to the community for

Corrections 
The headline on Page 3 of 

Monday's Guardian that read 
"UCSO's twenty-fifth 
anniversary series" was 
incorrect, and should bave 
read "Bookstore addresses 
complaints, Issues." In addition, 
the article stated that tbe 
Bookstore buys back used 
hooks at 50% of retail 
regardless of whether they will 

be used the next quarter." 
Actually they pay 50% for books 
(hat will be used the next 
quarter and 10% for those 
that will nor. The Guardian 
regrets the error.

Congress seeks. student iriput 

Financial aid maybe restructured 
By ANNA SEVERSON, Staff Writer 

FEDERAL financial aid to college students may undergo policy 
changes that will make most 
awards harder to obtain , a, (he 
Higher Education Act of 1965, 
the 20 year program fl cial 
assistance is slated for 
reauthorization this year. 

'These programs are under 
careful scurr iny in Washington 
these days. Students need to be 
Vigilant to help ensure the future 
of Pell Grants, student loans, 
graduate and continuing 
education financial aid and so 
on, to protect their rights, and 
the rights of generations to 
follow, to ge t a higher 
education," said Frank Viggiano, 
the Student Senate director of 
the City University of New York. 

Student leaders from 25 states 
around the nation met with 
Congressmembers in New York 
last November to discuss new 
policies on funding. They have 
been recommended to the Senate 
and already passed by the House 
(Dec 3), according to Viggiano, 
who directed the conference and 
hearings. 

"The consensus of the student 
leaders gathered here is tbat 
post-secondary. education should 
be one of the top national 
priorities for funding," said 
Melvin Lowe, CUNY sena!!! 
chairperson. 

100% I Grants ltL Loans 
....... ~ 

IncruK in the proportion of 
students who must ~PII)' their 
fmancia1 aid awards. 

"We brought together a group 
of people that had never been 
sought OUt before," Viggiano said. 
"It was unique - it wasn 't JUSt a 
laundry list of issues - they 
discussed the philosophical 
questions of higher education for 
tbe next decade and bow higher 
education should be funded for 
the next decade and bow higber 
education should be funded in 
this country," he said. 

The administration usually 
holds yearly hearings to revise 
the Higher Education Act, but 
tbis year they made no 
recommendation, so the House 
Went to those directly involved 
in higher education for the 
proposals, Viggiano said. 

"The bill «if proposals) was a 
big step for the non-traditional 
students, like tbe pan- time and 
less than part-time students ... 
and it helps to establish child 
care benefits for students' 
parents ... and to lower the age 
of independent students," 
Viggiano said. No changes will 
be made until one year after the 
bill is passed, he said . 

In California, there is be 
limit for being considered 
independent for fi nancial aid 
purposes. A student must live 
away from home and not be 
claimed on tbeir parents' tax 
forms. However, some states 
require that independents be as 
old as 24. 

The bill includes many "real 
posi tive changes," Viggiano said . 
"It will provide for one universal 
form for students with the Pell, 
GSL (Guaran teed Student Loan), 
NDSL (National Direct Student 
Loan) and otber types of aid . It 
should prove mucb easier for the 
school, student and government, 
hopefully." Tbe single form and 
simplification of criteria should 
cut down on office-work costs 
and direct that money towards 
aid, Viggiano said. 

The Reagan Administration 
anempt to reduce federal funding 
of higher education coincides 
with the end of the 20-year 
authorization of federal 
programs. The number of

A tried and true fonnula for apathy. 
This deems to be the appropriate time to rerun this ec.lHullal. 
We believe we have discovered the psychological formula that leads 

to apathy. In this photo essay, the quation Hb x Hd(1nt + Ins) = A will 
be explained and provec1 as a legiumate analysis of the cumulative state 
of attitude exhibited all.u(lg l il,- citizens of the Triton Territory. The 
report was prepared in light of the increasing aura of aloofness that is 
emulated in the body language of the studied species. 

Our attempts at intellectual provocation have failed ; our well disguised 
ploy of black journalism has backfired . Some unidentifiable forces have 
bound the creative capabili ties of the citizens in a plastic folder and will 
not open the clasps. They will not express themselves publicly; they are 
afraid of being reprimanded by their peers. Our recommendation to you 
if you wish to induce a dialectic discussion of the prevalent issues of 
the era is as follows: Study the calculated equation with rigor and 
instruct your managers to reverse the process. We believe this method 
should dissipate the terminal existence of muted opinion. Remember, 
eXamilll. the equation carefully. 
(1) The letter-integer Hb represents the common feeling of being 
heartbroken. The two entities pictured here personify that emotion. The 
male entity has just severed a long-tenn relationship with the female 
entity. Her gasping desire for condolence is being shunned by the tiny 
nihilist; he ignores passion and disdains the irrationali ty of regret. His 
posture of ponderence, the synchronicity of their puzzlement, is a key 
to a primary comprehension of the roots of apathy. For who acts with a 
general concern when romantic ism is dashed ? Our hypothesis is that 
this species-patented response to rejection of any sort is a feigned 
indifference, a benign growth of self-protectionism. 

When the two subject~ pictured here go their separate ways, it is 
highly probably that they will seek a passage of comfort; the native 
expression for this act is termed "drowning your sorrows." They may 
seek liqUid stimulants or put fire to an herb that injects a lyrical 
melancholy into their veins. Another option for these clinically 
depressed entities is an overly indulgent hearing of other natives' 
viewpoints on the implications of the schism. This step - the most 
self-defeating of all possible choices - nominally leaves a sour taste in 
the mouths of the heartbroken. This leads us to the second element in 
the birth of the apathetiC citizen. 
(2) The letter integer Hd represents the act of "heavy drinking." This 
state can be formally called "into the belly of the beast." Notice the look 
of defiance , the violent, quivering creases around the mouth . Also be 
aware of the peculiar etching at the brow. We believe that the 
destructed romantic slowly turns into a staggering example of primative 
regression. For within our interpretation of the reason for such heavy 
native use of liquid stimulants is included a theory of the legitimacy of 

true bravery (when one gulps down ounces upon ounces of the water of 
wisdom every evening to regain one's gutS, it is assumed that there is no 
real strength of character). 

Now a very useful deduction can be made if }OU look at the 
paraphernalia that surrounds the subject. Think ~ ,- to your 
preliminary studies of the governing corporatiol t he planet. There 
you have it. The subject has obviously lost his SOCial consciousness and 
concern for the other members of the species. He is indirectly 
supporting the Organization of Coors, an economic determiner and 
moral stigma within the mindset of the general citizenry. He simply 
soaks himself with apathy! 

A surprising feature of this element in the equation is contained 
within its most pungent manifestation. The drowsiness of the state of 
Hd rapidly becomes (although it forever leaves itself in the bloodstream; 
i.e ., "hangover") serious mental exploration. 
(3) The letter-integer Int represents "Intellectualism." Our romantically 
shattered subject has grown tired of the regressive illusions of the bitter 
liquid and henceforth plunges into the strains of intellectual thought. 
Notice the decorative aspects of native thought. We believe the head 
covering is worn so as to prevent brain seepage. The rings hooked 
around the ear region are used to keep a consistent and circular flow of 
ideas within a hand's reach. The pursed lips and spongy jaw skin are 
both signs of analytic saturation. Here we search for the roots of apathy 
by defining the stage of intellectual vigor as a mere additive to a much 
larger, more con lusive design. For as the subject adorns herself with 

collars of silver, so does the particular Triton lace its personality with 
flowery cliches. 

It is among the bastion of cliches where we have discovered the 
Tritons slipping into a world of morose insanity. They are cliches of 
political worthlessness, termed by the natives as either "liberal" or 
"conservative." We consider the leuer-integer Int promiscuous, for the 
state of intellectualism appears rational. In fact, the very existence of the 
intellectual stage can only be seen as a prescience for irrationality, or 
insanity, as the Tritons would define. 
(4) The letter-integer Ins represents the temporary state of existential 
insanity. This onslaught of undefinable confusion is the foremost 
indicator of apathy. For an apathetiC posture is one of exhaustion, and 
exhaustion leads to a careless society. 

The subject pictured here seems to be leVitating., Take note of her 
swimming eyes, nearly detached neck and geometrically obtuse stance. 
She is ablaze, a cold-hearted warrior of decrepit valor. You might expect 
a physical explOSion from such a Triton, but to expect is to be deceived. 
The subject is actually winding down, "falling from the heights of 
anxiety," as one native described it. 

This stage is the final preparation for the inevitable decision that 
each Triton makes before we can realistically satisify [heir position on 
the planet. We believe (and not without a severe amount of conviction 
that this sociologically distraught citizen has walked into the room of 
irrationality as a matter of course. Triton nature , if we may borrow the 
expression . These citizens have been so well trained at holing-up within 
their psyches that any other option for attitude is obscured . This is why 
we have added 1m to Ins, for the sum of these two states is the median 
between rationality and irrationality. Apathy, or nothingness in motion. 
(5) At this moment, your tool, the equation Hb x Hd(int + Ins) • A, 
(heartbrokenness times heavy drinking times I intellectualism plus 
insani ty] equals apathy) becomes a proven. This photograph depicts a 
scene commonplace in Triton SOCiety: tied-up hearts stepping on the 
freedom of opinion. Sand washi ng away mitiative. Newspapers eroding 
into the ground . The air, water and heavens spouting apathy, cowering 
in front of infinity.

Pnliticization of Courts 
By P • .. R QUERelA 

SIX OF California's sever Supreme Co un Justices arc lip for con fi rmation thiS 
ovember. A simple "yes" or "no' 

wil! appear beside each judge's 
name on the ballot. Si nce the 
establishment of judicial 
elcCtlons In 1934, no Judge has 
cver been th rown off the bench. 
In the past 50 years politics have 
played only a cursory role in the 
electoral process. Indeed , 
POlilic:S, whether hber.ll or 
conservative, should not be p<l rt 
of America's judIcial system. But 
times have changed . 

The radical right, led by 
standard bearers ranging from 
Attorney General Edwin Meese to 
Moral Majority president Jerry 
Falwell, have apparently 
succeeded in making polincal 
ideology, not experience, the 
primary criterion for nomination 
and subsequently appointment to 
a federal or state judgeship. In 
California , for example, the far 
right is clamOring for the removal 
of Chief Just ice Rose Bird. Not 
because she has proven 
incompetent in her 12 years on 
the bench, but because she is 
opposed to the death penalty on 
moral grounds. 
UlrraconSt:rvalives interpret her 
belief on this issue as an 
extenSIOn somehow of a hidden 
"liberal agenda" among simng 
Judges nominated by former 
governm, Jerry Brown 

fdons because it was proven that 
Junes Impo ed the ultimatc 
penalty so "arbitranly and 
('ap rlciously" that it warranted 
auel and unusual pu nishment ," 
, -: lear VIolation of the Eighth 

,mendment of the u.s. 
" Institution. 

In 1976, howeve r, this same 
'ourt, under intensc polit ical 
pressure from conse rvatlve 
groups, reluctantly agreed to 
return to the states the authority 
to resume executions if they so 
' hose. The prevailing 
co nservatism of the 1980s has 
shaped public opinion to creale 
a desire for less government 
intrusion in private enterprise 
and Draconian cutS in many 
worthwhile social programs, 
while simultaneously giving the 
government greater authority to 
prosecute , and in many cases, 
execute itS citizens. 

In the mid-60s only 45

Editor: 
I am writing to protest about 

hangpersons or highwaypersons , 
so I couldn't ask any of them. (1

on a cruIse at the moment ) 

We have good clear words in 
the English language, like 
manhole and manslaughter: they 
shouldn't be manhandled. To 
talk about airline hosts, or 
investment bankresses, is just 
plain silly, and I'm not sure that 
a lady govemor would like to be 
called a govemess, anyway. (As 
an emi nent authoress once might 
have said , a governor is a 
govemor is a govemor.) 

In her letter to the editor (Dec. 
5, 1985) Karen McGill expressed 
her discontent over the 
formation of a commi ttee to 
research and address "women's 
issues." Ms. McGill contends that 
labe ll ing a social and medical ill 
a "woman's issue" insinuates that 
there is "a whole battery of 
affliction's specific to our 
gender." Further, she asse rts that 
women "cannot claim equality 
and greater need at the same 
time." 

The establishment of a wo-
men's resource center does not 
imply that women are less able to 

Women, like any other social 
group, have specific interests 
and needs; to proVide facilities 
for dealing with all aspects of 
these issues (including the 
psychological aspect) in no way 
implies that women are weak. 

Women (and any other 
social group who so desires) 
have every right tr> bond 
together in an effort to contend 
with the often difficult issues 
that affect them.

Statements like, 'The chair took

are Silly. Chairs don't sit. When

of as a person , not as a piece of

I asked my landlady about this 
- she referred the matter to her 
landman. 1 asked the lady who 
brings the post - would she 
rather be called a postman, a 
postwoman, or a pOSt? (She 
hears well; the last seems 
inappropriate.) She said 1 should 
write to the postmaster, or

or maybe refer the matter to my

Financial aid 
Continued from JMIt 3 
have li Ued the gap," said Kate 
Jeffery of the UC systemwide 
Fi nancial Aid Loan and 
Collection Unit. In the mid 
1970s, 83 percent of fi nancial 
aid was provided by grants and 
only 17 percent by loans. Last 
year, only 40 percent was 
provided by grants and 52 
percent by loans. "This has been 
fo rcing many students to go into 
debt, she sa id . 

Other recommendations in [he 
national bill are: 
- Opposition to the Reagan 
Administration's proposed $4000 
cap on federal ald . 
- Opposi tion to requiri ng a 
high school diploma as a 
prerequisite for federa l fi nancial 
aid . . 
- Opposition to the $800 
minimum self-help contribution 
needed to receive Pell grant aid. 
- Opposition to the elimination 
of funding for the NDSL and to 
the State equal opportuniry 
grants 

"1 he HEA (Higher Education 
Act) is the biggest issue in 
financial aid , but not the only 
important issue ," Jeffery said . 
The Graham-Parker Act , a new 
proposal supported by the 
Reagan Administration could 
override the bill proposed at 
CUNY and could mean severe 
cuts in financial aid, according 
to Jeffery. 

"The ac t is aimed at reducing 
spending to balance the budget. 
No one knows how that's going 
to affect the students' bud~et,"

'T he expenditures in the GSL

said. "To reduce the budget,

students who demonstrate 
fi nancial need ," such as those 
whose family income is under 
$30,000. 

Scholarships are only awarded 
to students wi th a 3.75 or be tte r 
GPA. The undergradua te 
application states that 
"Completing the scholarship

consuming, and if your GPA is 
much below 3.75, you will 
probably not receive a

Prof redefines 'Culture 'Club' 
By DANIEL C. PALOMINO 

Many of us have a certain 
preconception of what a class 
will be like without knowing the 
least bit about it. We know we 
will love it or hate it, before we 
even expenence it. For me , 
Introduction to Cultural 
Anthropolgy was one of these 
classes. 

When I w'lllked into Peterson 
Hall for my first taste of 
anthropology, I was expecting 
one th ing, but I gOl a totally 
different experience. I enjoyed it! 
The lecture, contrary to my 
original thinking, was very 
interesting, even funny. 

.The teacher, who compares 
the !Kung bushmen's (yes , the 
guys in the movie The Gods Mus! 
Bt Craz;y) hunting-gathering 
strategies to thar of UCSD 
students' strategies of hunt ing for 
a pa rking space, makes hiS 
lecrures interesting and funny. 
This reacnon is often venfied by 
the attentive faces and the 
laughter, which prompted me to 
get some inSight on the man 
behInd the microphone. 

Professor Stanle>' Walens has 
done field work In Virginia City 
'evada and British Columbia. 

but IS most Interested In the 
Northwest Coast Indians As a 
coUege student he worked In a 
summer camp with the Kwaklutl 

Indians, who are "very 
fascinat ing people: he says. "I 
JUSt packed up and went to the' 
Northwest Coast ... It was totally 
impulsive ... and I have never 
regretted it." 

As a teacher in anthropology, 
Walens wants students to learn 
that social rules, as difficult as 
they are to change, are nOt 
written in stone. "This is not a 
class in social change - it is nOl 
me saying to students, 'Okay, you 

guys, let's a ll become liberal 
democrats .' That would be 
inappropriate for a un iversity 
setting. I ho pe to excite them 
intellectually, and get them to 
want to do that kind of change 
and questioning on their 0\.\11 ., 

In order to do this . Walens 
Incorporates humor IntO hi 
lectures. "People always t.lke theil 
own culture very senously; thell 
moral senses. and sen~e of ~elf 
are ned mto thelf cultural values 
Humor IS one w,wof needlIng 
people and glvmg them an out 
They can quesnon but don t 
have to take \I at face \ l'tll' 

Walens insists that every 
human being, especially at 
coUege age. is faced with 
questions like: Am I happy with 
my relationships? Can I change 
myself to make those 
relationships more satisfying for 
everyone concerned? What if I 
don't follow a set of values that 
everyone else seems to have? 

"It's important for me to set 
up ... a situation where people 
can start questioning their own 
values without me saying. 'Look, 
I want you to be this and this 
and this and this.' Professors 
have a great influence on their 
students. so, when I use humor, 
it's to back away from that kind 
of power." 

Poking fun at American culture 
does not mean that he entirely 
dislikes the culture . however. 
Walens says, "There are a lot of 
things I don't li ke about 
Amencan ulture at all, but I 
would say the same thing about 
any other culture." 

Walens finds the social aspect 
vf the Eskimo culture to be 
espeCially Interesting. "They have 
an IOcreulble emotional life and 
cooper.mveness. I would lIke to 
see •. )lnr of their structures of

How did I know? I didn't. But 
I suspected. And this winter 

vacaoon, my SUSpICIOns were 
verified. I went out into the real 
world. 

For two and a half weeks, I 
became a nothing. An entity; a 
cog in the grand wheel of 
empire, a single voice in the 
cacophonous din of society. A 
"friend" of mine fixed me up in 
a full-time job in a Century City 
law finn Coooh, ahhh!). Exacdy 
what my friends had in store for 
them, ~You'U regret it. .. .. I 
moaned, though they could no 
longer hear me. 

So 1 weru to work. I made $8 
per hour, for twO and a half 
weeks, and I even got to go to 
the office Christmas party. It 
wasn't wonh it. 111 [CD you why. 

Six thirty am. That's why. 
Never heard of it? Neither had I. 
That's what time 1 had to get up, 
ewry morning other than 

and a half. every day, reading 
and rereading the same license 
plate on the car in front of me 
and falling asleep al the wheel. 

"How can you bear it?" I asked 
my co-workers. 

"The radio," they whispered. 
"That's the secret. Tum on your 
radio in the mornings. Tum it 
way up." 

I turned my radio way up and 
blew out my speakers. I bought 
more speakers. I turned the radio 
way up again. It helped. It 
helped as much as anything 
could at seven C·&r@·!!) thirty in 
the morning. 

In those morning radio shows, 
they don't play much music. 
They do a lot of talking, and 
they joke a lot. But they don 't 
play much music , thank God. 
Because th~ know that as soon 
as they stan playing Van Halen, 
or Quiet CHah!) Riot or jimi 
Hendrix, some fool is going to

"Can you believe what he said

Priscilla would say to Devona. 

"They're at it again," a

to me. 

"He should have his face 
slapped ," Devona would say to 
Priscilla. 

"She'd like to slap something," I 
would whisper to my colleague, 
chuckling, 

"His face slapped," Priscilla 
would agree, "or somtthing! she 
would giggle. 

That was the excitement in my 
day. 

Secretaries are an interesting 
lot:. They lead double lives at the 
office, or at least these secretaries 
at the law finn did. The reason? 
"All lawyers are scuzzes!!" Bari 
would scream, as soon as she 
was out of hearing range of the 
man (lawyer) who paid her 
salary, and who seized every 
possible opportUnity to clutch, 
grab or fondle any pan of Bari's 
body that was within claw range. 

Dayna was all sympathy. "That 
little goblin Kagan tried to lift my 
shirt today," she confided. "Doh, 
I'd like to kick him in the teeth.ft 

"Kick him in the [Ceth," Bari 

would agree, "or somtthing!" 
This was comforting to them, 

so my young male yuppie friends 
' and I would not laugh. We 
wouldn't touch them, either, 
however. 

We understood where the 
ladies were at. Even I did, after 
only three weeks at the law finn . 
Being treated as an object was 
something I became acquainted 
with, because bosses are too 
important to waste time making 
friendly requests of "non-
executive personnel." Not when 
an order, snapped from the side 
of the mouth, around a comer 
and down the haD would get the 
job done. This is what my 
friends had to look forward to. 
"Youll regret it.. ." I thought to 
myself.

once again. I was so tired by 
New Year's that I spent the night 
at home and fell asleep at 10:30. 
Nice vacation, huh? 

If I had any money to show 
for it, 1 wouldn't complain so 
loudly. But with Christmas and 
weekends and lunch every 
day ... Yeah, I know, 1 made over 
5700 in three weeks, but wht'n 

you work in an olIice, and have 
a whole hour for lunch, you tend 
to get exrravagant. 

My pals and I would caD each 
other on the office phone 
network a few hundred times 
before 1l :00 am. and discuss 
where in Beverly Hills we would 
have lunch that day. ShaD we go 
to Cafe Roma? The Old World 
Restaurant? Fatburger? The 
Playboy Club? Ma Maison? ~'s 
Ribs? Oh, the possibilities were 
endless, and with my pockets 
well-lined, my common sense 
took winter vacation without me. 
At times, I was dropping 520 a 
day at lunch, just to keep up 
with my feDow cuisine 
connoisseurs. Crazy? I tell you,

do crazy things just to keep from

UCSD's twentylifth anniversary series 

Rocking beyond Beatles 
By LORI GUZMAN 

The year 1966 was not the 
most carefree in the history of 
the University of California at 
San Diego, It was not "Lobual," as 
we say today, nor was it "cool ," 
as was said in the fifties. 
Nineteen·sixty six was a period 
of idealistic auitudes, political 
protest and controversy aD over 
the world , and the faculty, staff 
and some 800 students at UCSD 
did not go untouched. 

Revelle Provost Assistant Ernie 
Mort, who came to UCSD from 
Ohio State University in the fall 
of 1966, described the campus 
atmosphere during this period as 
a "strong current of anxiety." 

"It was an ern of high idealism 
and, of course, there was a deep 
concern over the Vietnam 
conflict," Mon explained. "The 
campus was in a period of 
unrest. There were rallies and 
protests going on across campus. 
Many of them took place in the 
Revelle Plaza." 

Mort was on hand during 
many of these activities and even 
panicipated on occasion. His 
greatest concern , however. was to 
help the students through this 
difficult time. From September of 
1966 to December of 1968, Mon, 
as acting advisor of campus 
religious affairs , i merviewed 
draft-eligible men who sought 
deferment from the draft and 
arranged religious and sc holastic 
lectures by many popular 
sc holars and theologians. Mort 
himself lectured in classes 
offered through UCSD Extension , 
and served as adVlsor to the 
Associate Students. Along with 
these many services, he provided 
counseling to those who 
requested it and participated in 
informal group discussions. 

"There were many family 
conflicts at this time," Mort 
recalled . "There was growing 
animosity outside of La Jolla and 
in the neighboring community. 
People were afrnid that things on 
campus were getting out of , 
control. There were a few la~' 
sit-ins and the university 
administrators feared they would 
have to shut down. Things never 
got as bad as, say, Berkeley or 
Kent, but they were frightening 
just the same." 

To avoid isolation, UCSD 
moved to set up its first parent-
student orientation. "We felt it 
was critical that parents be 
invited to meet with faculty and 

fumibn Rental

CENTER 

administrators and to see what's 
going on here: Mort continued. 
"We hoped this would also 
lessen the amount of political 
hostility that had risen." Local 
tax payers threatened to revolt 
and state legislarure was reluctant 
to help out with the financial 
burden of operating the 
university. "Amon~ other things, 

it was also an invaluable learning 
experience. Students were able to 
find out firsthand the way 
government operates and their 
key role in society. Mort 
attributes the effectiveness of this 
opportunny to an ·ongoing 
dialogue" between staff and 
students. "It was necessary to sit 
down with the students and 

In 1966 college campuses rocked with more than the Beatles as students, 
including UCSD's 800, sent tremors of political unrest across the nation . 
Emie .Mort , Revelle Provost Assistant, recalls those days. 

it encouraged UCSD to go out 
and do its own fund raising," said 
Mort. 

"There were a number of 
people who felt the university 
was allowing too much dissent 
among students and it was very 
difficult for the chancellor to 
walk the thin line between 
making the people of La Jolla as 
well as government officials 
happy, and protecting the rights 
of the students C the right to free 
speech and protest)." 

While it was a difficult period, 

discuss what was going on and 
why: said Mort, who, while 
serving as resident dean , 
participated in many 
conversations and debates that 
often went late into the evening 
in some donnitories. Topics were 
drawn most from the realiry and 
implications of the Vietnam War. 

"The students themselves 
didn't seem much different from 
students today," reflected Mort. 
"They had the same career 
objectives and were baSically 
here for the same reason: to 

fURNITURE 
SAlE 

30-70% orr 

prepare for graduate studies and 
jobs." Mort sees the only 
noticable difference as bei ng 
generational and very subtle. 
'Today, students seem more 
concerned with the economy 
and whether or not there will be 
a viable job waiting for them 
after graduation." Mort also 
recognizes a return to more 
traditional values, a trait he finds

FEATURES 

more characteristic of some years 
rather than others. 

UCSD today seems to have 
more than made up for any 
negative affects of the 1960s. 
"UCSD has developed rapidly," 
said Mort, "I believe it has a 
greater level of marurity than 
many of the European 
institutions it was deSigned 
after." E::J 

Culture club 
Continued from peae 8 
advantages and disadvantages, so 
Walens teaches students to 
question their own culture. 

CoUege is the place where we 
first begin to really question 
things, but some people react 
violently when their culture is 
questioned. "I want people to 
learn anthropolgy even when 
their initial reaction may be 
hostile . It's important to jolt 
people at the stan, but not too 
much. There are certain 
conditions in which people 
change and certain conditions in 
which they resist change . 
Cultures very strongly resist 
change." 

Wcilens' first anthropological 
analysis entailed going through 
college dorms and looking at 
what people had on display as 
images of their personal identity. 
"There's no reason why anybody 
can't do that. Everybody does 
this kind of analysis in some 
fashion ," subconSciously or 
otherwise . A person's clothes and 
the cars he or she drives, the 
way a person stands, walks, or 
carries on a conversation are aU 
symbols of how they feel, or how 
they want others to perceive 
them. 

There are many ways one can 
get involved in doing 
anthropological research on their 
own. Eventually, your own 
personality and interests will 
decide what to emphasize . 
Having been a musician, Walens 
has been on stage quite often, so 
he is fascinated with cultures 
that have many stage 
performances. "I've always been 
fascinated by the nature of 
drama and performance ," he 
says. 

.As an anthropologist and 
teacher, Walens thinks it is very 
important for students to get 
involved in social groups that 
have common ideas and mayor 
may not have a cause . "College is 
a time where one stans their 
own social groups," he says. "A 
great deal of learning who you 
are is by watching what it is you 
become involved in." 

Being in a social group "shows 
you're not an indiVidual. .. and 
keeps you from feeling cut off 
from everyone else, as people do 
when they go to a coUege .... So 
much emfhasis is put on 
individua achievement, as al Jny 
good college .. , Csocia\) groups 
help people to realize there's a 
similarity of social fonn around 
- th~t you're not cut off." 

Walens states that American 
culrure has a great deal of 
symbol; pposition between 
being independent, an 
individual , yet also harmoniously 
fitting into a compact social 
group, He says that it is 
impossible to balance the two. 

"At a time when people are 
feeling more lonely than they 
normally would , like going off to 
college, joining a social group is 
a very important part of feeling 
like a part of society." 

One of the first things mught 
In anthropolgy, Walens says, is 
that we are much more alike 
than we ever thought possible . 
"The amount of difference felt 
Cby a person) from other people 
is mostly an artifi cial feeling. 
People have many more 
similarities in their values. their 
ideas and what they expect to 
happen in a social situation than 
).:JU would ever realize." It is this 
s truggle to understand basic 
principles wh ich govern human 
behavior and thought that is the 
objective of cultural 
an thropologis ts. 

Walens would like his 
students to go beyond what they 
read in psychology textbooks as 
being "normal" behavior, and to 
become aware of the analytical 
skills that they use, and how "'_ 
those skills can affect analysis. If 
they can become perceptive to 
those differences "then I feel I 
have achieved what I need to 
achieve as a teacher," he says. 
- Aside from [Caching, Walens is 

putting aU of his energy into 
.finishing a book he is writing on 
Northwest Coast an. Afterwards, 
he plans to do field work among 
the Kwakiud, on their art as it 
applies to modem life. Il:J

Tritons 
topple 
Trinity 
By MATI lAIT ,Scaffwnrer 

T HE UCSD men's basketball team beat the Trinity Tigers 80-76 in a game 
\.\ lH~re the Tritons let a 26-point 
lead slip to 3 with 35 seconds 
left 

Last night'S game marked the 
halfway point of the Tritons' 
season. Their record is currently 
7-6. 

Even though it appc -red as if 
the players had giant 
chokeberries with their Wheaties 
that morning, coach Marshall 
said , "I was not at all worried . I 
felt that at any given point we 
could have gone back to our 
strengths and settled things 
down "I wanted to playa lot of 
combmatlons and see a lot of 
dlfTerent players get some time ." 

The reason the coach IS trying 
many different combinations IS 

.panially due to the fact that the 
team is young and he still 
doesn't know which players work 
best together. "Eve n though all 
the expenmenting should be 
done by now, I still have some 
young kids I need to see play," 
Marshall said , "Somebody once 
said to me, The best thmg about 
freshmen IS that they tum Into 
sophomores.' ThIS IS true with 
our team. Our young players get 
ranled out there sometlme~ but 
the only thing you can do IS gIve 
them more playmg time because 
sltling them on the bench 
doesn't do any good ." 

With a 47-27 lead at half it 
looked as If the Tmons had the 
game locked up. BUI the second 
half saw a determined Trinity 
team chippmg away at the lead 
and taking advantage of the 
Tmons' sloppy play. 

In 10 minutes the Tigers had 
oUlscored the Tritons 27-14. But 
It was too little toO late as UCSD 
held on to Win 80-76. 

Although many of the 
"different combinations" Marshall 
tried didn't work out well , he 
received good playing time from 
nonstaning veterans Mike 
Alvarado, Steve Dabasinskas, and 
especially Thor Dekker, who 
contributed 12 points. 

Greg Kamansky drops In two of his 18 points against Trinity. 

In addition, former staner Bill 
Reese is "pulling out of hIS 
slump, hitting 50 percent from 
the field last night," Marshall 
said . 

Greg Kamansky. the leading 
scorer with 20 . and transfer 
Bnan Backens have played 
conststently well and form the 
backbone of the team along with 
the exciting and emotional 
point-guard . JIm Smith. 

Marshall was also very pleased 
with the performances of jun ior 
Andy Jedynak and freshman 

Reggie Arnold , who appear to be 
a crowd favorite . 

friday the Tritons play Notre 
Dame at home in the La Jolla 
Classic at 8:00 pm. This will be 
the second meeting of the twO 
teams. UCSD won the first 
contest in ovenime. 

"Notre Dame is a good 
scrappy little team but I expect 
to beat them and I expect to be 
In the finals with pOSSibly Grand 
Canyon on Saturday night," salel 
coach Marshall . llil

W0111en Cagers 
off to slow start 
By FLIP HARRISON , Staff Wnter 

It looks like the grinch was 
back in action this Christmas, 
slithering down from his frosty 
mountain hideaway ro take away 
victories and shooting ability 
from the UCSD women's 
basketball team down in 
Tritonville. He retumed, however, 
after realizing the true meaning 
of Christmas and after the 
en.largement of his hean size by 
three ,the big guy returned all he 
could to the women Trirons. 
Much ro Coach "Cindy Lou" Judy 
Malone's displeasure, though, the 
grinch-turned-Santa forgot to 
return much of what he had 
taken , including their much 
needed shooting ability. In tum, 

he left the women with a dismal 
two-win , five-loss Christmas. 

UCSD won their first 
Christmas break game ,a 64-58 
victory over Pt. Lorna. In the 
contest , Heidi Jungling bagged 
16 pOints, Chris McCallum had 
14 and Lynne McLevie nailed 12. 

Returning home, however, the 
team dropped a 76-62 loss to 
CSU Los Angeles in a tough 
game. McLevie h it for 21 points 
and grabbed 14 rebounds while 
Shanda Elzy had 9 points and 
seven rebounds. The Tritons shot 
39 percent but also turned the 
ball over 23 times. In their next 
two games the Tritons shot a 
mere 25 percent and 22 percent 
in losses against Pomona and 
Whittier. Playing Pomona in 
beautiful downtown Claremont, 
the Tritons lost 64-40, and to 
Whinier 74-53. In the Pomona 
match the only bright spot was 
Elzy's 10 points while the 
Whittier game was highlighted 
by Courtney Simp~on's 12. 

Comi ng home the club lost 53-
35 agai nst CSU Stanislaus with no 
players scoring in double figures . 

In their last game 01 1985. 
however, the Tnions nearly beat 
out Hamline UniverSity. An 
atrocious 31 turnovers were the 
calise of the loss, though only by 
a margin of 60-65. In the game, 
McCallum hit for 17 points and 
rookie Shellie Vellie popped for 
II. 

Bringing in the new year in • 
style, the Triton club beat 
Western State College in an 
exciting overtime victory. 

.... Contributing to the final 63-58 

.g score were McCallum with 18 
0::: points, Vellie with 14 and 
~ Jungling with 10. Meanwhile, 
£ Shanda Elzy, from her guard

can continue on their roll and

The sun rises early 
by mikel toombs 

Way back in 1951. a film came out of Japan that changed the way the 
West thought about the motion picture. The film, directed by Akira 
Kurosawa (whose latest film, Ran ["Chaos"] is currently screening at the 
Fine Arts), was Rashomon, and it shattered the notion that filmmaking was 
inherently an American and European activity. 

"Rashomon is generally regarded (by the West) as the beginning of 
japanese cinema," said David Owens, assistant director of the Japan Film 
Center, part of the New York-based japan Society. "It was a great 
revelation to European and American viewers back in the 1950s who had 
never assumed that anything like this could come out of japan, a nation 
that the Allies had defeated a few years before." 

Rashomon, which created a "boom" in Japanese cinema appreciation in 
American art houses and on the European festival circuit, was indeed a 
revelation, but there was still far more to be discovered. "There was never 
any real investigation of the Japanese cinema that preceded the war," 
Owens said by phone from New York earlier this week. "And so 
whenever Japanese cinema was discussed, it was always beginning with 
Rashomon. " 

Fortunately, he continued, "Since the 1960s, more and more people 
began to look at older films - partly because more and more of them were 
being rediscovered in warehouses of the film studios, as the studios had to 
clean out some space to find room for material they were putting out." 

The increased interest in pre-WWn films attracted the attention of 
Japanese fiim scholars and historians, and in particular British film critic 
john Gilliat. "japanese critics of his a,cquaintance never. ~m~ to 
mention these things," said Owens, "but he found these fascmanng ftlms 
that he really loved, that no one had really said much about. About 10 
years ago, he put together a series called 'Unknown Treasures of the 
Japanese Cinema,' including films from the '30s right through the 19605. 
He became more interested in the 1920s and '30s - but especially in the 
'305 - and so as he looked atthe films of several directors that he liked -
Gosho, Kinoshita, and another one who was being discovered as he was 
doing this research, a fellow named Shimizu - (he decided) there needed 
to be another retrospective of the films just from the '30s and early '40&." 

A condensed version of this new series, dubbed "Before Rashomon," 
will screen six consecutive Thursdays in Mandeville Auditorium, starting 
tonight at 8 pm with a double bill of Burden of Life ( 1935) and A Pot Warth 
a Million Ryo. "I think the opening double bill is outstanding for two 
different kinds of films," enthused Owens, who will speak here before

stage has been lit with their 
p roduction o f Geo rge 
Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion, 
directed by Jack O'Brien. Any 
UCSD student who went to 
th is show received t he 
additional pleasure of seeing 
(and hearing) the remarkable 
professor of drama Eric 
Chr istmas, who played 
Arthur Doolitle, father of 
Eliza . 

The play, set in turn-of-the-
century Edwardian London, 
concerns an argumentative 
grammarian, Professor Henry 
Higgins, and one Colonel 
Pickering. The two set out to 
convert a gutter-class flower 
girl into a grand society lady, 
in six months of intensive 
coaching. This Bernard Shaw 
play was, of course, the 
inspiration for the musical M:y 
Fair lAdy, and many of the 
lines of Shaw were used in that 
more famous show and 
movie, to the extent that when 
they are uttered Ollltage in 
Pygmalion, one almost expects 
the characters to burst into 
song. It is to the credit of the 
Globe production that they 
did not stoop to exploiting 
this deja w, but rather, played 
the show straight, with all its 
own wit and social comment. 

The players worked quite 
well together, their characters 
actillj and reacdllj off each 
other in the kind of resonant, 
almost harmonic behavior 
that makes for good enaemble 
performance. The openillj 
scene was a wonderful bustle 
of upper- and lower-clua 
people takina shelter from the 
sudden rain. half b':3fina 
into each other, all ina 
with diverse London dialecta. 
Yet, all thia atudied chac» 
came off like an oiled 
machine. 

Thia idea of people and 
cw.e. bumpillj into each 
other is well developed 
throlJlhout the play - for 
inlaaRCe, the viaidna scene at 

Henry Higgins' mother 's , 
when Eliza relates her story of 
influenza, diptheria and gin to 
the shocked admiration of the 
upper-class but impoverished 
Eynsford-Hills, who take it all 
as a new kind of " small talk." 
The various reactions of 
Higgins, his mother, Pickering 
and the three Eynsford-Hills 
were studies in real character 
differences. 

There was a change in parts 
midway through the run of 
the play, which moved james 
R. Winkler into the role of 
Higgins, and Neil Alan 
Tadken into the role of 
Freddie Eynsford-Hill. 
Fortunately they had 
mastered their new roles and 
without the program addenda 
sheet to inform one, it might 
never have been noticed. 
Higgins was masterfully 
obsessed with having things 
his own way, and Freddie 
leered at Eliza quite genteelly, 
if such a thing is possible. 

In fact, the whole cast was 
superb. The casting and acting 
went a long way to bring to life 
a London story from 80 years 
ago. The dialects of the street 
people were rich and melodic 
to the ear. Myra Carter (as 
Mra. Pierce, Higgins' 
housekeeper) and Barbara 
Dirickson (Eliza Doolitle) 
were especially remarkable in 
their languase. Carter played a 
c .... ie. concerned, English 
housekeeper with depth and 
concern, and Dirick.on 
tran.formed herself from 
srowlinl IUttef pi to a 
lOclety ... tyled lady. 

The s. set was quite 
inleniou., conveb!.~i a 
monumental street na 
front into a warm Edwardian 
drawiOl room. and then 
convertin8 that into Hiaina' 
mother'. parlor. ApinIt thia 
rich and evocadve let, the 
players lived out the witty 
fantay. The COItuma at.o 
evoked the era, from the drab. 
worn clothes of the street 
people to the beautiful aown

'The Alchemist' revisited 

Bang bang 
by daniel thomas 

The alarU\ bells began 
ringing in my brain on the 
evening of November 20th, 
when a drama acquaintance of 
mine (not associated with this 
journal) told me that a friend 
of hers in The Alchemist had 
confessed that the company 
was feeling some disappoint-
ment with its work. She told 
me that that night's preview 
performance had been 
cancelled, in lieu of another 
rehearsal, before they would 
re-open for their second week 
on the Thursday the 21st. 
Later that Wednesday night, I 
wallced by the department 
bulletin board and saw the 
official posting in the chilly 
darkness, performance 
cancelled. cast line-through 
scheduled. "Hmmm," I 
thought. 

Now, I may have only 
begun writing for Hiatus last 
spring, but in the years since 

leaving high school, I have 
acted in a number of 
productions, and I know what 
it means when a preview 
performance is cancelled for a 
rehearsal. It usually means 
that, in the opinion of the 
director and/or whomever, 
more work needs to be done. 
Yet, knowing this, I still did 
not run down the hill to the 
Guardian and rewrite my 
favorable review of The 
AlchemiJt for the next day's 
Hiatus, which had not quite 
gone to press. No, I walked 
slowly down, checked 
through the pasted copy for 
any spelling errors, added 
only the caption for the 
picture, and let it rest. Then, 
like Richard Cory. in Edward 
Arlington Robinson's poem, I 
went home and put a bullet 
through my head. 

No. Just kidding. However, 
1 was perturbed with myself.

Looking for a good review. 

How dare 1 enjoy a play that 
suddenly looked like it 
needed more work? But 1 had 
enjoyed it. There wu no 
getting around that fact. 

Well. further, stiffershocb 
were to follow. The Reader 
reviewer Jeff Smith, in a 
column that unfortuna~ly got 
mangled on the layout table, 
greeted me the next day, 
Thursday the 21st, with 
comments that "it'. the 
audience that gets stung," 
"The ALchemisr will do 
anything for a laugh." the 
production "CfUM ita aurface 
with a baroque veneer of 
shtick," the coltumes 
"overdress the acton" and 
the play was "overly ornate, 
broadly actI:d, and aJow." So,

Science/Violins 
The computer age has come 

to the music department at 
UCSD. A night of sweet 
electronic sound will come 
courtesy of Professor Janos 
Negyesy and graduate student 
Lee Ray. Done live and in 
concert will be three pieces of 
music Questions, Black Noise 
and Zivatilr. 

Three electronic violins, 
used independently with an 
electronic workstation will 
compose the three pieces of 
music. Each instrument is, in 
essence, a violin. They are 
roughly to an acoustic violin 
what an electric guitar is to an 
acoustic. 

The computer music 
workstation is the result of 
research that had been 
conducted at the Computer 
Audio Research Laboratory 
(CARL) of the Center for 
Music Experiment. Using a 
pitch / loudness detector, the 

violinist's performance is 
converted by a special-
purpose computer into 
commands for the synthe-
sizers, digital recorders and 
signal processors that make 
up the audio portion of the 
workstation. 

This performance reflects a 
uniquely collaborative effort 
which combines art and 
science. The concert will be in 
Sherwood Hall at the La Jolla 
Museum of Contemporary 
Art, 700 Prospect treet . 
Showtime is at S pm, Friday, 
January 10. Tickets are $7 
(general admission) and $4 
(museum members, students 
and seniors). Tickets are 
available through the UCSD 
Student Center Box Office, 
TeleSEAT and the Museum 
Box Office . For more 
information, please call 452-

Double your pleasure 
by mikel toombs 

Just about every critic with 
a sense of history has been 
pronouncing that in 1985, 
"Rock was more important 
than it has been in a long 
time" (cf., the Serious '60s), 
so I won't bother. Just note, 
however, that this Top 10 
submitted for your approval 
has 20 albums crammed into 
it: 

1. (tie) REM, Reconstruction of 
the Fables; and the Replace-
ments, Tim. White-boy rock 
at its serious 'n' yet not 
serious finest, although the 
Replacements are showing 
dangerous signs of maturity. 
3. Artists United Against 
Apartheid, Sun City. A cause, 
and a record that wasn't made 
just because. 
4. Zeitgeist, Translate SlowLy. 
Austin rules, OK. 
5. Husker Du, Flip Your Wig. 
And Minneapolis comes in a 
close second. 

The Replacements, with two concerts here this year and a great new album, 
'Tim,' were clearly on the right track. 

6. Katrina and the Waves, 
Katrina and the Waws. 
7. The Windbreakers, 
TerminaL. Spirited Southern 
guitar (and sitar) pop (from 
Jackson Miss.) haunted by the 
ghost of Alex Chilton's Big 
Star. Tom Petty should be 
embarrassed, 
S. (tie) Amy Grant, 
Unguarded; and . Frightwig, 
Cat Fann Faboo. The best 
utterly conservative album 
(Grant admits her influences 
are "your basic mainstream 
disaster") from the Christian 
superstar, and radical feminist 
noise from the San Francisco 
quartet. Let's see these people 
try to convert each other. 
10. Marti Jones, Unsophis-
ticated Time. Where is Dusty 
Springfield when you really 
need her? Right here, sort of. 
11. The Beat Farmers, Tales of 
the New West. 
12. Chris Isaak, Silvertone. 
13. The Jesus and Mary 
Chain, Psychocand,. 
14. Everything But The Girl, 
I...ove Not Money. 
15. Richard Thompson, 
Across A Crowded Room. 
16. Fetchin Bones, Cabin 
Flounder. 
17. Suzanne Vega, Suzanne 
Vega. 
IS. Meat Puppets, Up on the 
Sun. 
19. The Cure, Hood on the 
Door. 
20. The Waterboys, This Is 
The Sea. 

Guilty Pleasure: Jane "The 
Brain" Wiedlin, jane Wiedlin. 
The ex-Go-Go leaves the 
talent to others, but she isn't 
afraid to ask tough questions 
like "What's so great about 
Modern Romance?" (Last 
year's GP: Madonna, Like A 
Virgin.) 

Last year was a bountiful 
one for surprisingly good 
concerts, starting at the top: 

1. Fats Domino, at the Wild 
Animal Park . The New 
Orleans legend struck back 
with, er, animal ferocity. 
2 . The Replacements, at the 
Backdoor. The April show of 
thrash, trash and crash was the 
most entertaining, but the 
relatively sober December 
reprise came darn close. 
3. Katrina and the Waves, at 
the Del Mar Fair. Some find 
these guys lacking in 
sophistication, but for simple-
minded folk like me the 
Waves' basic rock was nearly 
perfect - and the head Wave 
earned extra points when she 
played the best noise-guitar 
heard in these parts until the 
Jesus and Mary Chain hit 
town. 
4. REM, at the SDSU Open 
Air Theater. 
5. True Believers, at the Spirit. 
More great rode 'n' roll from 
Austin, with an added plus of 
Rl'eat covers of T Rex's "20th

What a thinker audience and had a good time. Still, I wondered, did my love of classic plays blind me 
to any possible weaknesses in 
the production? It's true I love 
old plays, especially Greek 
tragedies and English 
renaissance works. Reading 
over my review I note a 
number of almost pseudo-
literary remarks, and I wonder 
if I was acrually prejudiced to 
enjoy the show even before 
the opening lines were 
uttered. Yes, perhaps I was 
prejudiced by my love for 
classic plays, and by my belief 
that they should be changed, if 
need be, but that most 
importantly, they should be 
staged, often. Still, how could 
this prejudice account for all 
of my very real enjoyment of 
the performance? There also 
had to be something good 
happening on the stage to 
make me like it that much. It 
would have been impossible 

Continu ed from paRe 3 
Anne Marie Welsh came to 
my apartment doorstep for 
breakfast. She, too, did not 
take to the show. The 
Alchemin, she wrote, was 
staged "with almost no 
contemporary resonance." 
The production was "ponder-
ous," "seldom more than 
leaden" and "the comic 
rhythms simply never take 
hold." But she did admit that 
"thanks to a few well-coached 
actors, a few funny bits are 
hilarious." And, in contrast to 
Mr. Smith, Ms. Welsh 
believed that show was 
"beautifully designed. It So, in 
her review, I guess, she was 
giving the show a C or C-
minus. And, as any UCSD 
student knows, a C is not a 
good grade. It might be 

passing for an undergrad, and 
sure, they might not throw 
you out of school for it, but 
it's nothing to write home 
about, nothing to ask money 
for. And if you're a grad, 
forget it, you're gone. Richard 
Cory had a solution for that, 
however, without any need 
for academic probation. Bang. 
Bang bang bang. 

Well, what was I to think, 
saluting the flag in left field 
while other reviewers were 
out in right field thrOWing 
spitwads? Did I miss 
something? Did I see 
something that wasn't there? 
Perhaps. But, would I change 
my opinion? No. I saw the 
play; I liked it. It was too late 
to change my reaction to the 
show. That gun was already 
fired the night I sat in the

pleasure out of thin air. I 
know myself that well, at 
least. 

SQ maybe the company was 
dissatisfied enough to cancel 
its preview for an extra 
rehearsal; and certaihiy the 
Reader and Union reviewers 
did not enjoy the show like I 
did; but I am not going to give 
up my opinion. No. No 
matter how out-of-step and 
perhaps biased it may be, it 
was my opinion, and I 
honestly reported it to Hiatus 
readers when I gave my 
personal feelings about - and 
my response to - the show. 

Theatre reviews, I was

melodrama." Meanwhile, Pot 
(directed by Hyakuman Ryo 
no Tsubo) is a satirical action 
film about "a popular 
cha ra cter from Japanese 
legend, sort of like Paladin -
he's sort of like 'Have Gun, 
Will Travel.' He's a one-eyed, 
one-armed swordsman ne'er-
do-well - a nihilist sort. He's 
sort of like the Clint 
Eastwood good guy-bad guy 
from the Fistful of Dollars 
movies."
