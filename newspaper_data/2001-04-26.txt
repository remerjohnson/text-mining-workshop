UCSD Environmental Coalition sponsored the events 
By DANA WEST 
Staff Writer 

The annual Earth Day Celebration took 
place on Library Walk and in the Price Center 
on Monday. UCSD's Environmental Coalition 
sponsored the event, along with several other 
organizations geared toward the preservation of 
the environment, such as Muir Environmental 
Corps, CalPIRG, Ocean Awareness, Whale Day 
and Solar Electric. . 

The celebration kicked off at 10 a.m. with a 
talk given by Native American speaker Happy 
Bear. As the day progressed, the celebration 's 
attendants were entertained guitarist Scott 
Huckabay and bands The Dave and Damaru. 

jih Miesel from Whale Day also spoke to 
students about many issues surrounding the 
protection of the ocean and received much sup-
port from the crowd. The event finished off 

with a free showing of the Dr. Seuss film "The 
Lorax" at 9 p.m. in the Price Center Theatre. 

Christine Brochard; president of UCSD's 
Environmental Coalition, was pleased with the 
outcome of the event. 

"The main focus [of Earth Day[ is to educate 
UCSD about the environment and create 
awareness," Brochard said. "I think it was very 
successful in making people think a little bit 
more about issues that they weren 't aware of 
before." 

Students stopped to take a look at the many 
booths on Library Walk during the celebration. 

A popular attraction was the Electric Vehicle 
Fair set up in front of the Career Selvices 
Center. The fair featured five models of electric 
vehicles, including a two-person "neighbor-
hood" car, a Chrysler minivan, and a Honda

Quarterly Academic Senate ",eeting Convenes 
Elimination of SAT I scores, UC Merced, summer school among topics discussed 
By STEVE LEHTONEN 
Staff Writer 

Summer school, gender equity, 
admissions, academic outreach and 
the development of UC Merced 
were discussed at Tuesday's 
Representative Assembly meeting, 
held at the Garren Auditorium in 
the Basic Science Building. 

Senior Vice Chancellor of 
Academic Affairs Marsha 
Chandler addressed the assembly 
concerning summer school and 
gender equity at UCSD. 

Chandler reported that the 
Bureau of State Audits has recom-
mended that the UC Office of the 
President undertake an increase in 
the hiring of women at the assis-
tant professor level. The audit 
found that · there is a dearth of 
female faculty at all UC campuses, 

The bureau alsc found that 
more women applied for positions 
as assistant professors, rather than 
as associate or fu ll professors. 

Chandler also addressed 
administrative responses to the 
need for the expansion of summer 
session. In anticipation of the new 
wave of students that will be com-
ing to the university, officials have 
attempted to raise summer session 
offerings to the caliber that typifies 
the regular school year. 

Summer s ssion at UCSD has 
always been entirely campus sup-
ported. Recently, UC Berkeley, 
UCLA and UC Santa Barbara have 
received funds from UCOP to 
improve the quality of education 
during the summer. UCSD, UC 
Irvine and UC Davis also expect to 
receive funds by summer 2002 to 
increase summer school offerings. 

Chandler joked about the mea-
ger funds given to the other cam-
puses. 

"We are next on the list for not 
receiving the money," she said. 

Chandler appeared hopeful 
about the proposed summer pro-
gram. She also felt that the' work 
done at UC Berkeley, UCLA and 
UCSB will help set a precedent so 
that UCSD can achieve a strong 
summer program. 

Chandler also requested the 
creation of a new position, associ-
ate vice chancellor of undergradu-
ate education. 

·We want to make sure we take 
care of the undergraduates with all 
the new students coming," she said. 

Chemistry professor Barbara 
Sawrey spoke about the contro-
versy regarding UC admissions 
procedures. Sawrey discussed the 

new Dual Admissions Program 
and the proposed abandonment of 
the SAT I. 

The DAP, set to take effect in 
2003, will require that the top 12.5 
percent of California high school 
seniors be accepted automatica lly 
to the University of Cali fornia . As 
of now, only the top 4 percent of 
every graduating high school class 
in California is guaranteed admis-
sion to a UC campus. 

Under the DAP, students 
would complete thei r general edu-
cation at a community college. 
The DAP diverges from the 
already functioning transfer pro-
gram in that the DAP will accept 
students directly from a junior 
college to a specific UC campus. 
Sawrey reported that high school

UCSD Biologist Wins Blasker Award 
UCSD biologist Julian I. Schroeder won this 

year's $250,000 Blasker Award for 
Environmental Science and Engineering for his 
discovery of the molecular mechanisms that 
allow plants to remove toxic metals from conta· 
minated soil. 

Schroeder will receive the award at the June 
13 San Diego Foundation ceremony. 

The Blasker Award is traditionally given to 
individuals or groups who have enhanced the liv-
ing conditions of San Diego residents and other 
communit ies by creating solutions to an envi-
ronmental problem that has already been select· 
ed by the Blasker Award 's committee of 
experts. 

Schroeder fulfilled this requirement by ident i-
fying the genes responsible for the transport and 
detoxification of such toxic metals as cadmium. 
arsenic and lead.

Collegiate: 
Lawsuit about housing for 
gays is first of its kind 
ontlnued from .,... 1 

A similar policy exists at Berkeley, which 
requires couples without children to be 
married in order to qualify for gradu.ate st~­
dent housing. Unmarried couples with chil-
dren . however, can also apply. 

Berkeley also rejects domestic partner-
ship registration, which is meant to be the 
equivalen t of a marriage certifica te for 
same-sex couples, as qualification for grad-
uate student housing. 

Harry LeGrande, assistant vi e chan~e1-
lor for the residence and student services 
program, said that the housing dilemma has 
been a difficult problem for many untversl-
ties. 

"All of the UC campuses have been grap-
pling with this issue for some time: 
LeGrande said. 

leGrande also said that although there is 
a need to "broaden the definition of 'family:" 
the university has done little up to this point 
to change the existing standards. The only 
significant change, according to LeGrande.

Mayor Dick Murphy declared 
a Hate Free Day April 23 
ontlnuecl from .,... 1 
Dick Murphy, who declared San Diego to be a 
Hate Free Zone on Monday after being 
inspired by last year's Hate Free Campus Week. 

. The reading of the proclamation was fol -
lowed by the first of four sketches performed 
lly the Social Action Theatre throughout the 

was a revision that allowed same-sex couples 
with children to qualify for hous.ing. . 

LeGrande said that the marrtage reqlure-
ment exists as a relic of the era in which the 
housing policies began. 

"It has more to do with tradition." he 
said. "I think the policies were written long 
ago, and things are slow t~ chan.ge." 

Chris ealon, the chaIr adVisor for the 
UC Berkeley Lesbian Gay Bisexual 
Transgcnder Services Office, said the mar-
riage requirement is unfair. . 

"I think same-sex domestic partners 
should have the same rights and privileges 
as opposite-sex married couples," he said .. 

Nealon also indicated that Berkeley Will · 
soon address the issue. 

"We expect a specific decision about 
same-sex housing any day now," he said. 
"It's an interesting time." 

The New York lawsuit, brought up by 
the American Civil Liberties Union, is the 

_ first in the nation to challenge a university 
housing policy toward same-sex couples. 

The ACLU suit alleges that New York 
City laws. including one that pro~ibits ?is-
crimination based on sexual Orientation, 
make the university's housing policy illegal.

Watson Infringes 
Upon Voters' Rights 

A public universi ty such as ours should 
not allow its students to have their rights 
yanked out from under them. 

Vice Chancellor Joe Watson 's decision to 
refuse to sign legislation that would allow for 
increased membership to the United States 
Student . Association and the University of 
Californ ia Student Association is an infringe-
ment on our power as students. 
. Students approved raising fees to fund the 
Increased membership earlier this qual1er, 
although the referendum will now never take 
effec t. 

The Guardian feels that the university 
should fo llow the lead of other UC campus-
es, specifically Santa Barbara and Los Ange-
les, who sent similar legislation to the UC 
Regents for their approval. 

Although the Guardian did not endorse the 
passage of this fee increase, we don't believe 
that Wa~son should unilaterally usurp stu-
dents' nghts to voice their views to the 
regents. 

Since last ~ear, the ~SSA has given UCSD 
a grant to hire extra staff to increase voter 
turnout on election day and has helped staff 
the Students of Color Conference in Febru-
ary. 

The Cuar1ian understands Watson's argu-
me.nt that thiS IS not a UC-controlled organi-
zation and therefore we should not sponsor it 
through referendums. However, students 
should be able to spend their money any way 
they please. 

The students have voted to increase their 
tuition by $6 next year to increase the 
sch.ool's participation in the organizations. 
ThiS money represents additional aid to 
USSA on top of what the A.s. Council cur-
rently gives to them. 

This means that the administration would 
not have to pay an extra cent for the added 
be.n.efits of increased participation. In a school 
CritiCIZed for its apathetic students the 
Guardian thinks the administration should 
:-vant to do everything in its power to increase 
Involvement and quality of the school's 
~vents. B~ not signing this legislation, Watson 
IS endorsIng Just the opposite. 

The $6 per year is not a lot to most stu-
~e~ts, but it matters dramatically when mul-
tiplied by the total number o( students at 
UCSD. This money :-vould do a lot of great 
thIngs for campuses like ours that are in need 
of help. 

The students have definitively expressed 
:-vhat they want and now it is time to fight for 
It. The Guardian feels that the members of the 
stud~nt body should not accept Watson 's 
deCISion and lobby to protect their rights as 
students. 

A precedent needs to be set - that we will 
not allow the administration to act this way 
on matters that only affect the students. Wat-
son would be wise to consider that the stu-
dents see potential in this referendum and to 

f~ ll~w the lead of other UC campuses and by 
slgnmg the bil l. 

Although the bill still needs to be' passed 
by Chancellor. Robert . Dynes, the UC Regents 
and UC PreSident Richard Atkinson, it will 

n~ver even be read by any of these individuals 
Wi thout Watson's approval.

Referendum's Proposed Funds 
Shortchange Some Organizations 
Heavy-handed ta~tics ~f supporters of proposal to improve campus life, fail to 

address whether disperSIon of funds will assist all campus organizations equally 
By TOM vu . I~tegral to students, receives $2.50. The 
Opinion Editor 

I hope it's not.too late by th'e time you 
read thiS. For thiS entire week, the stu-
dents of UCSD have had the opportuni-
ty to affect the future of this campus. 
Doc Khal~ghl, the A.S. president, wrote 
III an article earlier this week in the 
Guardian that the future of this universi-
ty hangs in the balance. And I have to 
admit, for better or for worse, our presi-
dent is correct. 

. But I hope that by the time you read 
thiS article, be it at Espresso Roma, the 
?locks on Library Walk or during a polit-
Ical sCience 112A class, you have not 
made the grave mistake of voting "Yes" 
on this referendum. 

To state it simply, this referendum is 
bad f?r UCSD and bad for students. It is 
pOSItiVe, but for the wrong groups. The 
Immense costs (and I am not referring 
only to monetary costs) that will be 
borI;1e by students outweigh the minute 
benefits. ' 

Do not jump to the conclusion that I 
am against expanding the Price Center or 
renovating the Student Center. After all , I 
have to work in the dingy offices of the 
Guardw/I , which are located in the Stu-
dent Center. But perhaps what I say will 
open your eyes to how detrimental this 
referendum is, if I - someone who could 
galll so much from it - could still actu-
ally be against it. 

I agree that student organizations 
need to be better funded , that O.A.S.LS. 
needs more funding, etc. However, ' this 
referendum is not the way to bring about 
such changes. 

Adm~ttedly, the ~xtr~ fee of $71.40 per 
qual1er IS worth brlngmg about positive 
cha.nges to ,the campus. What I have 
agal11st thiS IIlcrease is how the money 
will be allocated and what I see as a waste 
of our dollars. 

According to the Special Elec~ion 
Voting Guide, $19 of the $71.40 will be 
dis tributed to intercollegiate sports, 
while the LGBT Resource Office receives 
a measly $0.50. The International Center 
IS alloca!cd $0.25, while the Women 's 
Center g~ t s $0.50. O.A.S.l.S., which is 

list goes on. What I see here is a serious 
misallocation of funds that strays away 
from what this u!1iversity holds most 
Important: academics. 

Just between you and me (and I do 
not intend to insult the athletes on cam-
pus), sports are f~r from important to the 
ove~a.ll ltfe of thiS school. Yes, we are in 
Dtvlslon II, but let's get serious. This is a 
schoo~ set on academics, and simply 
throwmg money at the sports teams will 
not change that. It is only the mentality 
of the stu.dent body that can change that 
fact; wastmg our money will not. 

Another part of this referendum is the 
prospect of placing synthetic turf on 
M.uir Field. Really now, what the hell is 
thiS about? A person just has to ask 
"Why?" ' 

Another drawback to this expansion 
plan .is that it would hardly change cam-
pus life here, despite the name of the ref-
erend,um. This referendum allows for 
what seems like another Price Center to be 
built. 

The expanded Price Center will offer 
nothing new to students. Will building 
more ballrooms make your weekends 
any less boring? Will more student 

lounge~ really be useful in keeping you 
entertamed? Perhaps the administration 
stmply wants to keep students bored so 
they'll use the expanded study lounges 
on the weekends. • 

Why not use the funds to build a 
student union? For god's sake, CSU 
Long B~ach has a student union , com-
plete With several bowling lanes. The 
funds should actu~IIy be used to help 
make student life less bland rather than 
wasting it with more ballrooms and big-
ger offices for the A.S. Council mem-
bers. 

FurthermorlO. and on a personal note, 
the way the proponents of the referen-
dum .are p~omoting it is simply annoying 
and msultmg. On Monday, several stu-
dents approached me while I was quielly 
munching on my fries. In their hands 
were stacks of voting "guides, wh ich offer 

~tatements f~voring and opposing the fee 
IIlcr~ase, trylllg to seem bipartisan about 
the tssue. 

However, like Jehovah's Witnesses, 
these propo~ents come up to students, 
shovmg their Ilterat~re into people's 
faces. They preach their values, trying to 
shepherd students to v~)fe "Yes." They try 

~o capture. the apathetic student (which 
IS the majority at UCS9) so they can 
obtain their 20 percent of students nec-
essary to pass the amendment. They 

~angle treats such as sodas and cookies 
10 front of .students who vote, like a 
farmer danglmg carrots or apples in front 
of a mule. They try to imitate the politi-
cal machines of Richard Daley or Bill 
Thompson by offering promises of 
greater opportunities if we vote their way. 

. The referendum, however, will not 
bnng greater opportunities. Instead the 
referendum will waste student funds: It is 
a half-hearted attempt at bringing about 
change on campus, and does so badly. 
The ~unds are badly misallocated, not 
focusmg on what is most important to 
the school and to its students. It offers 
nothing that would make the weekends 
of students li~ing on campus any better. 
The laundry list of promises provided in 

th~ voting guide is nothing more than a 
veil over. students' eyes to keep them 

. from seemg how poorly the money will 
be spent. Students must take the good 
with the bad. . 
. I admit that not all of the referendum 
IS ba? The increased funds are going to 
the ngh.t places, though not in the right 
proportions: I agree with the concept 
that finanCIal aid covers the increased 
fees for students that qualify. I a,gree that 
the two · centers need to be able to 
accommodate more students. Yes, the 

~tudent organizations need better fund-
mg. Howe~er, this current plan is not the 
way to bnng about this much-needed 
expansion. 

I~ previous years, students have reject-
ed .slmllar proposals and should do so 
agal~ thts year. Students should continue 
to reject these proposals as long as they do 
not serve t~e greater population of the 
campus, not Just some small minority such 
as the frats and sororities, 0" athletes. This 
IS, afte~ all, our campus, and, as Khaleghi 
wrote, ItS future is in our hands. Only we, 
the students, can know what is best for it .

Sacrifices Pay Off With Honors Capitalism's Ugly 
Effects Felt at UCSD Ideal 

Angle 
ANGELA CARRIER 

T here is an indescribable excitement experienced when a letter is received 
in the maiL So, naturally, I was 
thrilled the other day to see an 
envelope not resembling any 
sort of bill in my mailbox . 

Examining the outside of the 
envelope, I saw my name print-
ed in thick black calligraphy, 
and in the corner I noticed the 

" graphic on the return address 
labe.!: a black graduation cap 
with gold and silver tassels 
hanging from it. Then I read the 
name of the sender: Christine 
Rose Carrier. I had received a 
college graduation announce-
ment from my beautiful 39-
year-old mother. 

Opening the envelope, I was 
ov.ercome with a feeling of 
pnde, yet at the same time, a 
feeling of regret. I am proud of 
the -years of effort and dedica-
tion that she has committed to 
her schooling, despite other 
conflicts she faced, which 
would have forced any other 
individual to give up. Not only 
was she a student, but she was a 
mother, a wife, a working 
woman and recently became a 
gra ndmother. Her responsibili-
ties include more than deciding 
between studying on Friday 
night or going to a party. 

My regret lies in all that she 
gave up by putting off her 
attainment of higher education 

for so long. She was the top of 
her class in high school, the 
~tudent body president, active 
10 both sports and academics -
but she did not attend her own 
graduation. She listened to the 
graduation ceremony from her 
home across the street. The 
sweet voice of her friend 
singing the graduation song 
came across as she stood alone 
and apart from the ceremony 
cradling a new baby boy in her 
arms. 

Less than two years later; 
that little boy of hers had a new 
sister. This girl was faced with 
all the opportunities her moth-

I would not be here 
today if it weren't for 
my mother and father. 
The values they 
instilled in me are my 
foundation, and I " 
strive to do well for 
their sakes ' and for 
myself 
er before her had, but she had 
to stay focused' and realize how 
fortunate she was. 

Part of my drive to excel aca-
demically in high school was 
because my mother had given 
up the chance to attend a uni-
versity because she decided to 
start a family. I had the ability to 
do what my mother would 
have, and I felt l owed it to her 
because she had sacrificed so I 
could exist. 

I would not be here today if 

it weren't for my mother and 
father. The values they instilled 
in me are my foundation , and I 
strive to do well for their sakes 
and for myself. I have to try 
hard not to forget that fact 
among distractions. 

The past "two years have 
been host to staunch competi-
tion between my mother and 
me in our schooling. She 
attends classes at night and on 
weekends at University of the 
Pacific, while I am here at 
UCSD. We have the same 
amount of work, but somehow 
she continues to soar above me 
in the GPA category. It is 
ridiculous to say that I have it 
harder here at this university, 
because my only responsibility 
is myself. I don't have to take 
care of a family or manage a 
local business, but I do stay up 
late at night reading and writing 
papers for my classes, as my 
mother does. 

I often forget how fortunate 
1 am to be at a university now 
and to be able to graduate in 
the usual four years. I regret not 
working hard enough in class-
es, sleeping through lectures 
and never cracking the cover to 
texts, when so many people 
would give all they have to have 
the opportunity to attend a uni-
versity straight out of high 
school. I neglect to realize how 
very lucky I am, something 
many others neglect as well, I 
am sure. 

I will forever admire my 
mother's courage to sacrifice 
her college education after high 
school to have a baby and

Some people seem to view the 
concept of a university as something 
that is untouched by the evils of 
society. Upon closer examination, 
however, it is clear that universities 
- especially public universities -
are one of the. sectors most influ-
enced by the state and its bureaucra-
cy. This is not to say that I equate the 
evils of society to the state and its 
bureaucracy. The topic at hand is a 
more general one: capitalism. We 
hate to love it, and we love to hate it. 
It brings us the lifestyle we have been 
brainwashed to desire while firmly 
planting guilty consciences in many 
of our liberal "bleeding hearts." 

In the words of Marx, it allows 
us as the bourgeoisie to control the 
proletariat "enslaved" in many of 
the world's lesser-developed coun-
tries. Overall, there is no way to get 
away from capitalism.The United 
States has used the power of capi-
talism's message to create a con-
sumer culture which is becoming 
worldwide. Through radio and TV 
waves, capitalism was a~le to break 
down the Berlin Wall in the eyes of 
many, and it is now softening the 
Chinese defense against it. Imagine 
the potential financial benefits 
American multinational corpora-
tions will have if they are able to 
transform 1.2 billion Chinese into 
loyal consumers of American prod-
ucts or services. I can see the dollar 
signs in the eyes of CEOs across 
the country. 

Clearly capitalism is overt on an 
international scale, but the most 
interesting data is how evident it is 
here on our cute La Jolla campus.

The ruthlessness of capitalism, 
which is equivalent to financial Dar-
winism, here at UCSD? Let's th ink 
for a second. 

I'm sure many have noticed the 
current buildings going up around 
campus. Let's see: an engineering 
building, two new parking structures 
and, as a typically uninformed. fa irly 
apathetic UCSD student, I cannot 
even say what the other buildings 
going up will be. And for fUl1h cr 
thought: I know of two huge engi-
neering buildings already in place 
here on campus, adjacent to each 
other. The third being built looks to 
be of a similar size. These three 
eflormous buildings will dwarf the 
Literature Building to their right. 
Some of you might not flinch to 
know that resources on campus are 
split up so unevenly. We have three 
massive complexes for engineering 
and one medium-sized building for 
literature, another popular major. 

The reasons for this particular 
financial distribution can be attrib-
uted to the effect of capitalism on 
our campus. Engineering is the 
major of the future. Literature is a 
major that maintains a certain aca-
demic tradition , in which graduates 
usually pursue teaching credentials 
of some sort. The donors who 
made this project possible, whether 
they be related to Dynes ' 100 mil-
lion shares of Qualcomm or not, 
have been brainwashed by capital-
ism's consumer- and producer-ori -
ented culture. 

What does literature produce? 
Only open-minded individuals, 
many of them teachers and writers.

First Hundred Days Spell 
Mediocrity for President Bush 
By SIMONE SANTINI 
Semor Staff Writer 

Som~ol1t: once said that "his-
\.Ory is a harsh mistress." George 
W. BliSh, silting in his office at the 
While House, must be contcm-
plillll1g those words. At the end of 
his tirst 100 days, everyone IS giv-
II1g him a failing grade: econo-
mists, environmenta lists, Europe, 
China - eve n sectors of the 
Republican party. Bush is discov-
ering that it is one thing to say "I 
will be a leader" in an electoral 
camp,lIgn and a completely differ-
ent thillg to ac tually be one. 

These first 100 days haye 
shown several tt'lltaic signs of 
thlllgS to come, and none of them 
.m.' good. 

It \\ ,IS dear by Bush 's chOice of 
cabllll·t 1llL'lllbns that the lime of 
thl' C.ullflilign had ended, and 
"comp,lssionall: conservatism" had 
ellded with It. The Bush admillls-
tration IS possibly even more politi-
cally extreme and ideologically dri-
ven than the Reagan cabinet was, 
With the addi tional complication 
that 2001 is not 1980 and the world 
IS no longer ready to put up with 
almost everything that comes out 
of the White House. The Soviet 
Union is gone, taking wi th it a good 
deal of the American grip on the 
West. 

The decision of th e new 
Jdlllinistra tion not to regulate 
carbon dioxide emissions made it 
clear that Bush's industrial back-
ers expect a lot in exchange for 
their support . This move also 
gives us some indication of how 
Bush will va lue his electoral 
promises and of what meaning the 
terlll "lyll1g" will have in the new 

ad ministration. 
As late as March 4, Christine 

Whitman, the new Environmental 
Protection Agency administrator, 
had made it rather clear that Bush 
would fulfill his promises, describ-
ing the carbon dioxide policy as if 
it were already implemented. Only 
10 days later, Bush announced 
that he had "changed his mind." 
Of course, the fact that the energy 
lobby group was one of his major 
financial backers had nothing to 
do with the decision. 

It is hard not to notice that the 
party that conducted a ruthless 
campaign agai nst former Presi-
dent Bill Clinton on the ethical 
basis that he "lied to the American 
peopk" (the legal case had a dif-
ferent basis) helped elect a presi-
delll who, technically, has al ready 
done the same thing. Since the 
president is Bush, the Republicans 
have the useful excuse that he was 
not really lying - he si mply didn't 
know what he was talking about. 
Still, Democratic congressmen 
might want to take notice. We 
might be getting close to grounds 
for impeachment. 

It is clear from looking at 
Bush's attitude toward the 
McCain-Feingold campaign 
reform bill that he intends to per-
petuate the kind of exchange of 
political favors for money that 
characterizes his policy. Recently 
the White House supported a bill 
sponsored by SenatOr Hagel as a 
viable alternative to the McCain-
Feingold bill. Hagel 's bill contains 
so many loopholes that it would 
virtually institutionalize soft 
money. The bill would place a cap 
of $60,000 per year on soft money 
to national candidates, lift every 

cap on hard money and allow 
unlimited soft money donations 
to state parties. If this is the kind 
of reform that Bush supports, his 
benefactors can rest reassured. 

His behavior in the face of cur-
rent stock market problems illus-
trates the fact that Bush and his 
administration don't understand 
the way the economy has evolved 
in the last 10 years. 

For the last few months, the 
United States has lived through 
the absurd situation of the "reces-
sion that wouldn't happen." The 
forecasts were gloomy, the stock 
market was falling, but now infla-
tion is low, the growth, however 
small, continues and unemploy-
ment is under control. 

Yet when an authoritative and 
reassuring voice in the administra-
tion would have helped restore 
confidence, our acting president 
was quoted blurting ominous 
warnings that made an already 
nervous economy eyen more jit-
tcry. 

All this was a cold-blooded 
political calculation; Bush knows 
that the only hope his party has of 
winning the midterm elections is 
to have all the relatively wealthy, 
moderate Republicans go vote 
with fatter tax return checks ill 
their pockets. Clearly Bush is will-
ing to do whatever it takes to pass 
his huge tax cut for the wealthy, 
even if it means even deeper cuts 
to social programs like Medicaid, 
which the Bush administration is 
basically wiping·out. If the econo-
my is really going to be as bad as 
the president says, he should be 
busy reinforcing the safety net for

Capitalism: 
Administration benefits 
from student contribution 
Continued from paCe 5 
ence in intluencing how people will 
think in the next generation. What 
will engineering majors produce? 
People who are controlled by 
multinational corporations and the 
state, constructing buildings, com-
puter networks, etc. This is not to 
say that engineering majors are not 
valuable. I just think their value is 
inflated because of the emphasis 
that capitalism puts on them and 
their work. 

Now let's discuss the other 
buildings being constructed: parking 
structures. Three will have been 
built on campus by the end of the 
year. What is the objective of parking 
structures? To provide parking, 
right? For whom, specifically? One 
might think parking would be pro-
vided for the majority of the people 
responsible for the success and day-
to-day operations of the school: the 
students. But it is now common 
knowledge that the construction of 
all these new parking structures has 
not increased the amount of parking 
available to students, but instead 
decreased it I was actually unaware 
of how much of a problem parking 
on campus is until this morning. It 
took me half an hour to find a place, 
and then 10 minutes to catch and 
take the shuttle back to campus 
from East parking. Keep in mind I 
Jive on campus, at Matthews. 

This familiar situation of stu-
dents getting shafted is a common 
theme here at UCSD. To again para-
phrase Marx, it is often the case that 
the ones producing do not reap the 
results of their own production. I 
know we at UCSD are nothing close 
to the toddlers working in the ike 
factories in Southeast Asia, but the 
relative priorities of those in control 
of the capital remain the same. In 

Thursday, April 26, 2001 

this case, the capital is the university. 
Without us, UCSD is nothing. But 
we are held in the grips of capitalism. 
We have been brainwashed, whether 
the information is true or not, to 
seek education at the best university 
possible. Then we as students will 
obtain our degree and continue our 
quest to be upwardly mobile and 
continue to rise through the elitist 
classes of society. 

It is interesting how many (vital 
word here: many, not all) of my 
Asian peers who have parents that 
are first-generation immigrants 
have adapted to American society 
so quickly and moved up the social 
classes so fast. Many of them have, 
intentionally or not, sold out !o 
capitalism by becoming producers 
instead of critical thinkers. Funny 
how there is a disproportionate 
amount of whities at this school 
(including me) that are liberal arts 
majors and therefore noncon-
formists. Maybe we have lived in 
this country longer and our choice 
of major is a subconscious rebel-
lion against capitalistic society. Or 
maybe I have been at UCSD too 
long and have been brainwashed to 
think that I should be a science 
major. 

But to get back to my point. We, 
the students of UCSD, are the pro-
ducers of the university; society is 
the consumer of our successful 
college because they continue to 
send their kids here. However, the 
regents own the capital, so 
although UCSD owes its existence 
to us, we continue to get shafted in 
administrative decisions such as 
those discussed in this article. nly 
in capitalism could nine people 
control nine large universities, and, 
through the camouflaging tech-
niques of bureaucracy, frequently 
screw over those to whom they owe 
their jobs to and continue to keep 
the money rolling in . The regents 
know the system is too far devel-
oped to be changed dramatically.

She could have easily chosen 
other paths, but she did not. I 
know for a fact that many stu-
dents couldn't fathom leaving 
their education on the back burn-
er, but there are some things more 
imoortant and eternal, such as a 

ne~ life and family. My mother is 
one of the individuals I most 
admire because she has endured a 
plight wh ile others would have 
easily given up. She has persisted 
with determination and 
endurance and will be graduating 
as one of her university'S top stu-
dents. 

So I proudly pinned the gradu-
ation announcement next to my 
calendar, anticipating the day I 
will see my mother walk down the 
aisle in her graduation cap and( 
gown decorated with honors to 
receive her much-deserved col-
lege diploma.

those who will be hit the hardest, 
not dismantling what little net is in 
place. 

With the Bush administration 
completely unprepared to deal with 
contemporary foreign policy, the . 
Chinese were able to capitalize on 
their capture of the American spy 
plane and get pretty much every-
thing that they wanted. American 
policy is completely determined by 
a domestic agenda. 

Bush should take a more realistic 
approach and, if nothing else, ask 
himself what would have happened 
if a Chinese plane had been forced to 
land on U.S. territory while spying 
on us. And why do we expect the 
Chinese to act differently from the 
way we would have acted? 

Every country spies on other 
countries and, occasionally, some-
body is caught wi th his hand in the 
cookie jar. In this case, the rules of 
diplomacy suggest that you apolo-
gize like a good boy and go home. 
The administration only managed 
to give the Chinese a hug!;. image 
boost in the diplomatic scene, all 
because the domestic political agen-
da of the Bush administration 
requires an external enemy to justi-
fy military build-up. No wonder the 
international stature of the Ameri-
can president is at a historical low. 

Judging by the general tone of 
his first 100 days in office, Bush's 
political personality is only a pale 
shadow of Clinton's and can be 
summarized in the word "de-
Clintonization." It seems like the 
main activity of the Bush adminis-
tration is to reverse Clinton's 
executive orders; from privacy 
protection, the Kyoto protocols 
and patients' rights to the pres-
ence of arsenic in drinking water, 
the Bush administration is dis-
mantling everything the Clinton 
administration did to protect con-
sumer rights, health rights and 
privacy rights. 

If this can be expected from a 
business friendly, right-wing presi-
dent, the beginning of such a pres-
idency begs the question of 
whether Bush has a political per-
sonality. Will he be able to have a 
personality after his "de-Clin-

~D & NATION 
States are Creating Their Own 
Plans to Cut Drug Costs 

WASHINGTON - States are 
methodically creating and expand-
ing programs to help low-income 
elderly people buy prescription 
drugs. even as Congress appears to 
be floundering in efforts to add 
drug benefits to Medicare. 

Soml' states, like Pennsylvania, 
us,' state money to pay part of the 
cost of each prescription. Some, 
like California and Florida, have 
passed laws limiting the prices that 
pharmacies can charge elderly cus-
tomers. A few, like Michigan and 
Missouri, have created tax credits 
to offset the amounts spent on pre-
scription drugs. 

Other sta tes, including Iowa. 
ew Hampshire. Washington and 

West Virginia, have created buyers' 
clubs or purchasing cooperatives to 
help low-income elderly people 
obtain drug discounts. 

Two states, Maine and Vermont, 
have recently received permission 
from the federal government to use 
their Medicaid programs to provide 
drug discounts to tens of thou-
sands of elderly and low-income 

people who would not otherwise 
qualify for Medicaid. Maryland 
plans a similar program under a bill 
signed on Friday by Gov. Parris N. 
Glendening. 

And various states in the 
Northeast and the South are band-
ing together to negotiate discounts 
from drug manufacturers. Five 
states in the Northwest are consid-
ering similar joint efforts. 

Margaret H. Kuntz, a 71-year-
old retired · bookkeeper who lives 
outside Pittsburgh, said 
Pennsylvania's pharmaceutical 
assistance program was a lifesaver. 
She pays a $6 co-payment for each 
of the five drugs she takes. 

"It would cost me $400 to $450 
a month if I had to pay for these 
prescriptions on my own: Kuntz 
said. "I would not be able to buy 
them all." 

Congress has held several hear-
ings on Medicare drug benefits this 
year, but is nowhere near a consen-
sus. Lawmakers disagree on the 
basic question of whether to pro-
vide benefits to all Medicare recipi-

ents or just those with the greatest 
financial need. Official cost esti-
mates for all proposals have shot 
up 30 percent in the last year, con-
founding congressional efforts to 
set premiums, deductibles, co-pay-
men ts and other details of drug 
coverage. 

State officials said they were 
taking action for the reasons cited 
often by President Bush, members 
of Congress and elderly people: 
Prescription drugs account for a 
growing share of all health care 
spending. "States are responding to 
a vacuum in federal policy, the lack 
of prescription drug coverage 
under Medicare," professor 
Stephen Crystal, a gerontologist at 
Rutgers University in New jersey, 
said. "The state programs are very 
popular for good reason. They are 
meeting a real need. But in no way 
do they constitute a national safety 
net. It's a spotty system that exists 
in some places and not others."

Marines Investigate Sexual 
Harassment and Other Misconduct 

FO RT LEONARD WOOD, 
Mo. - When investigators arrested 
a Marine staff sergeant here last fall 
on charges of possessing chi ld 
pornography, many of his fellow 
noncommissioned officers dis-
missed the incident as an isolated 
one Involving a single bad Marine. 

But their easy calm has been 
shattered with the arrival of mili-
tal)' criminal Investigators who are 
looklllg into .ilccusations that at 
kast 19 :\'COs were involved in 
misconduct that included assault-
Ing and sexually harassing young 
:-'1al'lnr trainees at thiS base. 

At the center of the Inquiry is 
the 1annc arrested last fall, Staff 
Sgt. HOlI'ard W. Ross, 34, a 
dll'l1rc,'d 16-ycar veteran of the 
Corps who plc<lded guilty at court-
marllal to having sexual inter-
coursc with one female trainee, 
offering money to another to 
removc her clothes and dance for 
him, stealing from trainees and 
possessing child pornography. 

Three sergeants who worked 
with Ross are awai ting trial on 
charges that include assault . sexu-
ally harassing female Marines, buy-
ing alcohol for underage Marines 

McVeigh: 
Welch opposes execution 
on moral grounds 
Continued from page 1 
station owner, who since the 
bombing has become an outspo-
ken opponent of the death penal-
ty, a stance that is shaped in large 
part by hiS Roman Catholic faith. 

"And when we take Tim 
McVeigh out of that cage to exe-
cute hlln ," Welch said, "it isn't 
gOll1g to bring Julie Marie back." 

Almost since the immediate 
,lftcrm,nh of the bombing, the VIC-
tims ' relatives and survivors -
nearly 700 people were injured in 
the blast - have becn portrayed as 
onc monolithiC group, all bent on 
the ultimate punishment. 

But Bud Welch is not alone in 
that group in opposing the execu-

and being drunk on duty. Three 
others have left the Corps under a 
cloud, while at least 12 have been 
reassigned to desk duty pending 
the outcome of the investigation . 

Here at Fort Leonard Wood, an 
Army base in central Missouri, 
Marines attend classes to prepare 
them for one of four military occu-
pations: military police work, 
chemical weapons handling, engi-
neering or truck driving. 

It was in one team of the Illotor 
transport school that all the prob-
ICllls occurred during a seven-
month period last year, the Corps 
says. 

The problems in the group 
dated at least from last April and 
were publicly disclosed in October, 
when Ross was arrested after buy-
ing child-pornography videotapes 
from federal investigators conduct-
ing a sting operation. 

About the same time, a Marine 
who had recently completed train-
ing at Fort Leonard Wood told her 
superiors at Camp Pendleton , 
Calif., that Ross had harassed her 
by making sexually explicit com-
ments to her. A few weeks later, a 
second Marine woman made simi-

tion on moral grounds. 
Tim McCarthy, 30, whose 

father, Jim, 53, was killed in the 
blast, believes, as a Catholic, that it 
is wrong for the government to kill 
McVeigh . 

And Patti Hall , 64, who was 
crushed by six floors of concrete 
in the blast and has been on dis-
ability since, recalls that she cele-
brated when McVeigh was sen-
tenced to death, but she says she 
has since decided that "it isn't 
right to take a life." 

"God says 'Vengeance is mine," 
said Hall, who is Baptist. "But he 
a Iso says, .. Pray for those who perse-
cute you.' I'm praying for his soul." 

Peggy Broxterman, 70, wh se 
son Paul , 42, was killed in the 
bombing, is one of the 10 people 
who were chosen by lottery last 
week among the survivors and vic-
tims' relatives to attend the execu-
tion in Terre Haute, Ind. 

lar accusations, prompting the 
Pentagon to open its wide-ranging 
inquiry. 

Several of the 12 women among 
the 365 Marine trainees now at the 
motor transport school said in 
interviews that they had not expe-
rienced or witnessed sexual harass-
ment. But they complained of feel-
ing isolated, or of receiving 
unwanted attention. 

"You defini tely get a lot of 
attention because of the low ratio 
of women," said Pfc. Heather 
Doyle, 21. "Every time I turn 
aroLlnd, it 's 'Hey, Doyl·e. Over here, 
Doyle.'" 

Noncom missioned officers and 
trainees say they clearly under-
stand the rules that prohibit offi-
cers and senior enlisted Marines 
from socializing with, soliciting 
money from or mak.ing sexually 
explicit remarks to trainees. But 
they say those rules are easy to 
break in a place like St. Robert, the 
small town that borders the base 
and has streets lined with strip 
clubs, tattQO parlors and bars.

The New York TImes 

"It 's all for my son: 
Broxterman, a retired elementary 
school reading specialist, said in a 
telephone interview from her 
home in Las Vegas, explaining 
why she wanted to watch McVeigh 
die. "That means McVeigh is out 
of here, he's gone. He's out of life 
entirely. I don 't even want him 
breathing. He doesn 't deserve it." 

The one subject on which all 
sides seem to agree is that when it 
comes to the so-called concept of 
closure - a word more often used 
by members of the media, and by 
politicians who hold it up as one 
of the goals of capital punishment 
- it does not exist. 

"You close on a house," said 
Broxterman, whose son left a 
widow and four small children. 
"You don't close on a death."

Trial Delayed for 
Church Bombing 

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. - With 
the fa milies of four black girls 
watching from the front row, prose-
cutors opened the long-delayed 
murder trial of Thomas E. Blanton 
jr. on Tuesday by depicting him as a 
rabid segregationist who helped 
dynamite the 16th Street Baptist 
Church in 1963 and then insisted 
for years on driving obsessively past 
the scene of the crime. 

. U.S. Attorney Doug jones took 
jurors back in time to a 
Birmingham where efforts to 
desegregate schools and lunch 
counters met with determined and 
often violent resistance from 
whites, incl uding Blanton and 
other members of his Ku Klux Klan 
cell who, jones said, plotted in the 
darkness under a bridge. 

"There were people, and 
Thomas E. Blanton was one of 
them: jones said in his opening 
statement, "who saw their segregat-
ed way of life dissolving and could-
n't stand it." 

That may have been tr,ue at the 
time, Blanton's lawyer, John C. 
Robbins, said in his own opening 
statement. But Blanton's segrega-
tionist beliefs, Robbins stressed, do 
not prove that he was a bomber. 

By all accounts, the prosecu-
tion's case against Blanton is highly 
circumstantial, and Robbins 
encouraged the jury not to be 
swayed by the emotional tug of the 
deaths of Denise McNair, who was 
11 , and Addie Mae Collins, Carole 
Robertson, and Cynthia Wesley, 
who were 14. 

·You're not going to like Tom 
Blanton: Robbins told the iurors. 
"He was a loudmouth. H-e was 
annoying. He was a segregationist 
and he ran his mouth about that." 

Then he added: "Just because 
you don't like him and the views he 
espoused doesn 't make him respon-

The city has already 
endured two rebellions

The soldier then stepped back, 
lifted his rifle and fired at the 
ground around her feet while 
shouting obscenities at her, 
Khairullayeva and several witnesses 
said. 

The two students were eventu-
ally released, but not before the 
Russian squad leader leveled his 
rifle and threatened to shoot at the 
large crowd of teachers and angry 
students. . 

The murder rate is soaring here 
as Chechen rebels, and masked 
men who could be on either side, 
step up a partisan campaign in 
which terror is an increasingly dev-
astating weapon against civilians. 

An unidentified man walked 
into the central market last week 
and opened fire, killing three 
women before he fled. Grozny's 
deputy prosecutor, Vladimir 
Moroz, was drinking coffee in a 
cafe when three men walked in and 
shot him 20 times. Two Russian 
women work.ing for the electric 
company ~ere gunned dow.n late 
last month. 

This city, laid to ruin by two 
wars of rebellion against Moscow 
since 1994, mar be the most dan-
gerous capita on earth. And 
though the first postwar govern-
ment of Chechnya is finally taking 
up residence here, it will have to 

sible for this tragedy." 
Blanton, 62, is the second of four 

longtime suspects to stand trial for 
the bombing. He could be sen-
tenced to life in prison if he is con-
victed of the four counts of murder. 

Only one suspect originally 
identified by the FBI , Robert 
Chambliss, was ever tried. He was 
convicted in 1977 and died eight 
years later in prison. A second sus-
pect, Herman Cash;-died in 1994 
without ever being charged. 

Bobby Frank Cherry, another 
former Klansman, was indicted last 
year along with Blanto.n. But a judge 
ruled that Cherry's trial would be 
delayed indefinitely because a 
court-ordered psychiatric evalua-
tion concluded that he was mental-
ly incompetent. 

jones spoke of tape recordings 
made secretly by a friend of Blanton 
who had become an FBI informer. 
"He'll tell you that whenever they 
went out, almost always, Blanton 
wanted to drive by the .16th Street 
Baptist Church: jones said. "There 
was an obsession to go by and talk 
about it: 

And years after the bombing, 
jones said, a microphone hidden by 
the FBI in Blanton 's kitchen cap-
tured him talking about a Klan 
meeting under a bridge. "You'll hear 
him say 'the meeting where we 
planned the bomb:" Jones told the 
jurors. 

Robbins told the jury it would be 
unfai r to use the trial to right the 
wrongs of history. 

"It's not abollt closure: he said . 
"It's not about removing the tar-
nished image that Birmingham has, 
or you may feel Birmingham has, 
because of what happened here in 
the '60s:

face the anger and frustration of a 
population desperately in need of 
reconstruction aid and protection. 

The mayor of Grozny, Bislan 
Gantamirov, was recently asked 
how he was fighting the rebel activ-
ity in the city with its alarming tally 
of civilian killings. 

"We don 't: he replied. "Such 
crimes will continue until the 
police are armed and the govern-
ment decides who is responsible 
for the situation in the city: 

With 7,000 'Russian troops sta-
tioned here, the startling reality is 
that there is almost no law 
enforcement or security for civil-
ians in Grozny, and this remains 
the most significant factor in 
Moscow's failure to persuade 
150,000 Chechens still living in 
the neighboring region of 
Ingushetia to return home. 
Grozny's population floats 
between 90,000 -and 190,000 as 
refugees come to pick up pension 
payments and check on relatives 
and then return to safety else-
where. 

Even when Russian soldiers 
patrol the city looking for Chechen 
rebels, they are regarded by civil-
ians as another kind of threat. 

"I can say on the civilian side 
there is hatred" toward the military, 
said Vakha Gishlavkayev, a deputy 
rector at Grozny University. "Not 
so much because of the actions we 
witness, but because we civilians 
are so paralyzed."

You're 011 campus. Evell worse, you're in a 
dorm room. You're mllldlessly switching the 
channels on the television, and channcl 18 
catches your eye. You realize it's good-old Stu-
dent RUIl Television enhancing your relatively 
monotonous life with student- run comedy 
shows and music video programs. 

Most of the time you'll go right past this 
channel. In fac t, some students probably don't 
have channel 18 programmed into their televi-
sions. Why? Because students have always 
thought of SRTV as a station with shows that 
are mildly entertaining at best. 

But there has been something of a rebirth at 
SRTV While most on campus sleep peacefully, 
the people of SRTV are attempting to create a 
TV station that students will actually watch and 
respect. 

Operations Managers Mike Kaminsky and 
Talar Parunyan, with the rest of the SRTV per-
sonnel, have come together to give SRTV a new 
look and a new life.

KSDTmake

B DaVid Pllz Senior Staff Writer 

KSDT is UCSD's student-run radio station. 
Residing in the Student Center, it provides 
many opportunities for music lovers. 

KSDT has a lot to offer students and mem-
bers of the community. At KSDT, one c;:a n learn 
to be a DJ, or learn every aspect of music pro-
duction in the station's state-of the-art record-
ing studio. The studio has been used extensive-
ly to record local and underground music, 
some of which have even been used on bands' 
albums. 

There are also several departments at KSDT 
that provide fun and educational opportunities. 
The station's music department sifts th rough 
more than 80 CDs it receives from record 
labels per week and decides what to add to the 
station's archives. There are two general music 
directors, as well as many sub-directors who 
each review music from one genre. These 
include the hip-hop director, the electronica 
director and the metal director, to name a few. 

Other facets of KSDT lnclude thJ: promo-
tions department, which gets tickets for various

Someone like You 

Set in a metropolis with realistic char-
ac ters who lead troubled, single, profes-
sional lives, "Someone Like. You" is a 
movie that tries to provide a new twist on 
a trite story. 

Ashley Judd portrays the main charac-
ter, Jane Goodale, who delivers a surpris-
ingly believable perforl1lance of a wOl1lan 
hurt by men and deterl1lined to mah sense 
of their ambiguous nature. There is anoth-
er surprise with solid performances by 
Grcg Kinnear and Hugh jackman as the 
Itlen in jane's life, and by Marisa TOl1lei as 
the emotionally distraught best friend . 

Despite all these credible performances 
by the cas'!, "Someone Like You" fails to be 
anything more than another romantic com-
edy in which a young attractive woman falls 
for the man who has been right under her 
nose the whole time. 

There is, however, an innovative twist of 
adding unconventional "scientific theories" 
and 'hysterical farm narratives to give the 
movie a little individual flair. The occ,1sional 

- dreamy musings of jane, along with the 
seemingly. serious narration o,n, outlandish 
and humorous subjects, makes the film bet-
ter than many recent romantic comedies 
that exist for no reason except to employ 
good looking actors and parade them 
around half-naked. . 

Overall, the hackneyed plot makes this a 
rather mediocre film, though this can be 
expected from a fi lm of this genre. However, 
its occasional humorous and imaginative 
moments, incl uding the narration and 
explanation of jane Goodale 's- theories 
about men through analogous cows, makes 
the fi lm worthwhile if you are in the mood 
to see a romantic comedy. 

- Anne Cong-huyen 

Yi Vi 

You'd think 170 minutes of subtitled Tai-
wanese might be a bit of a meal. This film 
has won a wide array of awards, and it might 
take as much as 45 minutes to tigure out 
why. 

It's a good thing this leaves you about 
125 minutes for awe and apprecia tion, 
because this film is brimming with bea uty as 
it stitches a quilt where the patches arc 
everyday episodes that might not be as 
everyday as they at first secm. 

Birth, love, marriage and death within a 
fami ly are tangled in a mesh that emphasizes 
the view 'of time as circular, a view that is 
favored by many Asian epistemologics. The 
casting is superb, and the actors manage to 
express a huge range of emotions, from 
Hollywood hysterical sorrow, to dry, situa-
tional wit that almost resembles that of 
British social realist fi lms. 

The cinematography of this film must be 
seen. In a detached way that requires more 
effort from the audience than does your 
average Hollywood blockbuster, it paints out 
the intrigues and passions of the poltrayed 
family in broad, soothing brush strokes. 

The action is often shown as reflections 
or behind reflective surfaces, and the viewer 
is allowed to peel away the layers as one 
would peel a succu lent fruit. This parallels 
the rich texture of the family's intertwined 
stories and emotions. 

The film draws toward an unexpected 
conclusion : a death. One ca nnot help being 
overwhelmed by the elegance and ease wi th 
which this film copes with the cOl1lplexity of 
its own ·plot. There's nothing to do but lay 
back and be washed away by this tsunami of 
life 's events.

·U2 Leave Nothing Behind at 
the San Diego Sports Arena 
Fans are stuck in the moment after U2 brings them back 
into their hearts in a relatively intimate concert 
By UNDSAY BOYD 
Staff Writer 

[f being a rock star was a subject 
in school, Bono could write the 
textbook. 

Clad in leather and sunglasses, 
Bono worked the crowd like true 
~ock royalty at last Tuesday's U2 
concert at rhe San Diego Sports 
Arena. The arena was packed with 
die-hard U2 fans, many of whom 
have been following the band 
across the country on their "Eleva-
tion" tour. 

The stage was set up with a 
heart-shaped catwalk that extended 
into the floor, dividing those who 
wert: ILJcky enough to get general 
admission tickets into two separate 
sections - inside the heart and 
outside. 

As the crowd lined up waiting for 
the Sports Arena doors to op~n, the 
tension grew and everyone braced 
themselves for the mad dash to the 
Sports Arena floor. When the doors 
opened at 6 p.m., it was hard to tell if 
it was a U2 concert or the running of 
the bulls. As soon as the security 
guard said "go," hundreds of fans 
flew through the doors to grab the 
coveted spots "inside the heart" that 
was reserved for the first 350 people. 

Whether you were inside or 
outside the heart, Tuesday night 
was still an undeniable spectacle of 
true rock 'n' roll. 

Equally exciting as U2 was the 
opening act, PJ Harvey. Harvey 
played an 11 -song set from her 
recent album, "Stories from the City, 
Stories by the See," along with some 
old favorites including "Angeline." 

When on stage, Harvey is a 
breathtaking beauty and an amaz-
ing musician . While her band was 
plagued by amplifier problems and 
broken guitar strings toward the 
end of her set, Harvey seemed 
un fazed, finishing the set with a' 
smile on her face. 

[n unusual form, the lights were 
not dimmed when U2 took the 
stage. [t\stead, they surprised the 
audience by just walking on stage 
rather than making a grand, dra-
matic entrance. Bono is dramatic 
enough without creative lighting. 
They played their first song, "Ele-
vation," with the house lights on. 
Then the lights went off and the 
entire arena was ready for some-
thing special. 

The stage show was compli-
mented by numerous lights and 
video and projector images. This 
show was toned down from U2's 
more elaborate ventures, such as 
Zoo TV and Popmart. The lights 
and frills just made the show more 
beautiful. Each time Bono or The 
Edge paraded down the catwalk, 
they were bathed in rays of light 
from every angle. 

U2 played a two-hour set that 

included two encores and all of their 
hits: "Sunday Bloody Sunday," 
"One," "With or Without You" and 
many others. What was so striking to 
those who were close enough to see 
the expressions on the band mem-
bers ' faces was how they still seem to 
genuinely enjoy being a rock band. 

During "Sunday Bloody Sun-
day," drummer Larry Mullen smiled 
like he was playing the song for the 
first time, and truly seemed pleased 
that the crowd was singing every 
word. Amidst the entire spectacle, it 
was the small exchanges, the little 
smirks and the gestures among the 
band that were the most memorable. 

Part of the night was devoted to 
remembering . those who have 
passed. "Stuck in A Moment You 
Can 't Get Out Of' was dedicated to 
the band's late friend and INXS 
lead singer Michael Hutchins. 
Then, Bono dedicated many songs 
to Joey Ramone, who passed away 
Easter Sunday after a long battle 
with cancer. 

Bono, a longtime Ramones 
admirer, was one of the last people 
to speak with Joey as he lay in the 
hospital on Good Friday. In an arti-
cle written for SonicNet.com, Kurt 
Loder wrote, "On Sunday, when 
Mickey Uoey's brother] and his 
mother got a call from the hospital 
to come in, Mickey brought a copy

U2: 
Dedications mades to 
Joey Ramone and twins 
Continued from ..... 13 
of the current U2 album, 'All That 
You Can't Leave l3ehind: and 
slipped the CD into a little boom 
box in Joey's room. The track he 
played was Bono's own 'In a Little 
While.' When the song came to an 
end, Jo~y was gone." 

. , 

The most charming moment of 
the night was during the song 
"One," when Bono altered the 
lyrics slightly to "three sisters, two 
brothers," acknowledging a set of 
blond-haired sisters and two 
adorable red-headed twin brothers 
in the front row. 

While the rest of the arena could 
not see the siblings near the stage, 
Bono smiled like it was an inllide 
joke - something to be shared 
between him and those sisters and 
brothers who will probably have 
smiles on their faces fo r weeks. 

The "Elevation" tour must give 
U2 a sense of redemption after 
their disappointing Popman tour. 
This time around, they are playing 
to sold-out arenas of screa ming, 
adoring fans who ca me from places 
as fa r as Ireland to see their home-
town heroes. 

Tbis tour proves that bigger is 
not always better. The band has left 
behind the ci rcus of Popmart and 
Zoo TV, and are instead giving 
their fans a bare-boned rock show. 
U2 proved that there is still a place 
for rock music, and fans will turn 
out to see a band that aftcr all these 
years still manages to movt; us in 
mysterious ways. 

SRTV: 
Times are changing for 
student television 
Continued from page 10 

"We are asking everyone to think 
of this as year on_c at SRTV," Kamin-
sky said. "This is the first year we've 
had the funding and the personnel 
to transform our studio into a legit-
imate college television station." 

SRTV is techn ica lly not a stu-
dent organization. Rather, it is a ser-
vice of the Associa"ted Students. 
SRTV was originally created in 1996 
as an offshoot of KSDT with a grant 
from the A.S. Council. 

But times are changing, and 
SRTV is ready to stake a claim in 
student life. 

"We are expanding our show 
line up," Parunyan said . "While we 
traditionally did music and 'couch' 
ta lk shows, you will see more polit-
ical shows, more comedy-style 
sketches and definitely more cover-
age of events on campus." 

.SRTV's new endeavor is to 
report on every A.S. event next year, 
as well as giving exclusive interviews 
with bands that perform on campus 
and other features to the students. 

SRTV's staff also wants to pro-
vide more coverage for sports teams 
on campus, as well as for events put 
on by other student organizations. 
SRTV has already been sighted at 
Round Table during the A.S. election 
results and in the Price Center dur-
ing the "Take Back ~he ight" event. 

"We encourage any organization 
to come to us arui we'll help them 
promote their event for free." Parun-

SRTV: 
SRTV plans to film and 
sponser more events 
Continued from page 14 
yan said. 

SRTV wi ll also take on a new 
role, that of being an organization 
that sponsors events. These savvy 
TV kids were behind the recent lis-
tening party for Radiohead's new 
album, and a hard-core punk rock 
concert on the UCS D campus is in 
the works. 

Whether you like it or not, SRTV 
is growing and finding more expo-
sure on campus: 

"In just one year, our member-
ship has grown from fo ur members 
to 40," Kaminsky boasted. "We are 
actually getting new members every 

-week, and I think this is because 
people are realizing tbat we are a 
place to come to where you can 
learn things that will actually help 
you for the future ." 

"We also want to focus on help-
ing people who are interested in the 
entertainment industry," Kaminsky 
continued. "There are very few 
classes on campus that allow you to 
learn digital editing, but we have the 
cameras, computers and staff to train 

- anyone who's interested. We've also 
been. working with the big networks 
to get people who work at the station 
internships and jobs." 

SRTV was able to get new 
equipment due to an increased bud-
get, and that has allowed the station 
to do two-camera shoots along with 
special effects and mixed audio. 

Kaminsky gives credit to the 
administration fo r the increase in 
support and equipment. 

"The administration has been 
extremely supportive of our new 
direction, and we definitely wouldn't 
be able to improve if it weren't for 
them." he said. 

So consider this the dawning of a 
new age for SRTV It has always 
been underrated but is coming back 
strong. 

"We want SRTV to feel more like 
a college TV station that's unbound-
ed by traditional rules of network 
TV, which allows its viewers to par-
ticipate and be unafraid to take a 
stand on issues." Kaminsky said. 

The UCSD Guardian 

Throu.,. tit. Lena: Susy Del Vecchio and Jared Lindo host "VideoSO" which airs on 
Thursday nights from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. 

For these same reasons, don't 
expect to see SRTV on your local 
cable access channel. A conscien-
tious decision was made not to 
expand its reach off campus due to 
the limitations of what people 
could say and do on the air. 

"There was also a movement to 
generate more revenue to the sta-
tion by selling ads to corporations." 
Kaminsky said. "But we shot that 
down because, again, we didn't want 
to answer to any higher power, 

except the students, of course." 
SRTV has been reborn. It asks 

people to fo rget about the past and 
look to the future as it makes itself 
known- on this campus. Soon 
enough, channel 18 won't be 
avoided. 

SRTV meetings are held every Tues-
day night at 9 p.m. above the Bike 
Shop in the Student Center. New 
members are always welcome. E-

KSDT: 
Students can listen to 
KSDT on the Internet 
Continued fronI ..... 10 
concerts and events for on-air give-
aways, the news department and 
others. 

More than anything, KSDT is 
here to broaden the musical tastes 
of its listeners and members. Its 
music policy is that no mainstream 
music is allowed to be played on 
the air. Basically, if you hear it on 
91X, it won't be played at the sta-
tion. 

"There is already a forum for 
those kinds of styles," said Brian 
Brick, one of KSDT's music direc-
tors. 

"We try to expose interesting 
and new music that people haven't 
heard," said Jeff Pease, general 
manager of Student Cable Works. 

When KSDT Operations Man-
ager Lynne Baczynski first came 
to the station her sophomore year, 
she knew nothing about any of 
the bands in KSDT's giant 
archive. 

"There was so much music out 
there that I didn't know about," she 
said. 

By having a radio show and 
talking to others at the station, 
Baczynski said she has learned 
about the variety of excellent 
underground music out there. 

The variety of shows at KSDT 
reflects the station's immense 
breadth of music selection. There 
are two types of shows at ·the sta-
tion: variety shows and specialty 
shows. 

Variety shows are 50 percent 
feature-play music, which includes 
new music that has been added to 
the archives within the past two 
months, and 10 percent new-add, 
which is old music that has recent-

Lots '" VInyls: Jeff Pease, general manager of Student Cable Wbrks, looks through 
KSDT's vault of vinyls. KSDT receives dozens of albums every week. 
ly been added to the station. What 
constitutes the remainder is up to 
the Dj. Specialty shows are shows 
with themes, which range from 
blues to reggae to metal to news 
talk shows. 

Unfortunately, KSDT does not 
have an FM transmitter, which 
makes it hard to listen to. San 
Diego's airwaves are full because 
they are shared with high-powered 
stations based in Mexico, which 
leaves little room for small, non-
profit radio stations. 

Recently, there was the prospect 
of getting a low-power FM trans-
mitter that would broadcast 
throughout an approximate five-
mile radius. The idea was discarded 
because of legal issues. 

The past few years have been 
pivotal for the station. In addition 
to broadcasting on cable radio 
(95.7 Cox Cable FM), KSDT 
broadcasts on SRTV from 10 a.m. 
to 6 p.m. and over'the Internet via 
streaming MP3. 

When KSDT first started 
broadcasting over the Internet, it 
was through RealPlayer, but new 

software would have been too 
expensive. The station then 
moved to Webradio.com, which 
eventually imposed too many 
rules. KSDT switched to stream-
ing MP3 because the technology 
is free and there are fewer regula-
tions. 

KSDT is currently in a time of 
transition. Station Advisor Randy 
Woodard, who always fought hard 
to get what the station needed, 
retired this year. Also, many of the 
directors will not be coming back 
in the fall and there are a lot of 
positions to fill . 

You'll find that KSDT is a very 
welcoming place and encourages 
everyone to come in, whether it is 
to get involved with the station or 
merely to sit and listen and hang 
out. Creativity is encouraged and 
the station always welcomes new 
ideas for shows. KSDT needs new, 
eager people who love music to get 
involved. 

According to Baczynski. "Being 
part of KSDT has been one of the 
best things I've gotten out of col-
lege."

Men's Water Polo Heading for the Deep End 
Five members of a very successful water polo team that reached the 2000 finals will be graduating 
By scon BURROUGHS 
AssocIate Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's water polo 
t~dm is bidding adie u to five key 
performers - five hard working 
playas who were instrumental in 
the tram's success ovcr the last few 
seJsons ,md who will be missed 
wilen the squad hi ts the pool next 
fall . 

Their accomp lis hmrnts and 
contributions to the Triton polo 
progral11 are vas t, incl uding crucia l 
paformances en rou te to this sea-
son's Cinderella run to the finals. It 
can be sa id that Canyonview pool 
will seem a lillie bit emptier now 
(hat Jason Boettner, Eric Rosen, 
Glenn Busch, Kenny Woodruff and 
Justin Wylie hal'e swam off into the 
sunset. 

Wylie was one of coach Denny 
Harper's main scorers, tallying 27 
goals last season on 63 shots. He 
also had 16 assists. 25 steals and 
was the team's No. 1 two-meter 
defender, despite a shoulder injury 
that plagued him down the stretch. 

"Wylie had a phenomenal 
career here, and rea lly emerged as a 
key player for us," Harper said. "He 
had so many big plays and big 
moments, despite a pretty signifi-
ca nt injury. He never whined about 
it, he was just a tough kid. It 's going 
to be hard to have someone like 
Justin out of the program, because 
he had this way of keeping every-
one loose and having a good time, 
which is something every success-
ful team needs." 

Boettner, the team's co-captain, 
has been one of Harper's main 
weapons during his four-year 
tenure on the UCS D polo team. 
His statistics for the 2000 season 
reflect his dominance in the pool. 
He scored a whopping 43 goals on 
91 shots, while compili ng 40 assis ts 
and 42 steals during the season. 

"I don't even want to think 
about Jason not playing," Harper 
said . "His presence was missed

Bye: Triwn water palo seniors (fralll lift to right) jason Boettner; Glenn Busch, Eric Rosen, Kemry Woodruff and justill Wylw will no longer be with the team. 

during his redshirt year, when he 
concentrated on swimming. 

Harper said that Boettner was a 
pleasure to coach. 

"He's one of the very few guys 
that I've had in my program who 
can play an enti re water polo game 
and not get tired," he said. "Jason, 
in my mind, represents your old-
school, hard-nosed athlete. He was 
beyond coachable, and had such a 
huge senior season. I told him 
before the season that he was going 
to have to score more goals, but 
even I didn't think he'd go out for 
five goals against USC In the 
NCAA semifinal." 

Harper noted that Boettner's 
presence transcends the mere con-
fines of the pool. 

"If I had to rope in some guys to

The family name will still be 
heard around Canyonview Pool, 
though. 

"It is going to be tough to fill his 
spot, but I'm happy to say that I'll 
be able to say the Boettner name 
around the pool for four more 
years because his brother Travis 

has committed to UCSD, which is 
kind of cool," Harper said. 

Busch has been coach Harper's 
brick wall in the cage, logging 71 
quarters of action in the 2000 sea-
son alone. His goal tending was 
sharp enough to come up with 150 
saves and allow only 121 goals for a

6.82 average. He also picked up 
eight assists and 11 steals during 
the year. 

"Busch was a local kid, out of 
Poway, who had a great career; 
Harper said. "He definitely saved 
his best for last; he got progressive-
ly better each year. He was not a 

huge guy but was all about angles 
and reading the shooters. He had a 
solid senior year. He didn't have 
any real breakout games, although 
his game against USC was pretty 
huge. His performance, though, 
especially in the second half of the 
season, made all the difference in 
the world." 

Woodruff is another quality 
player that is leaving the squad this 
year. He had a strong 2000 season, 
boasting a .500 scoring average, 
with 14 goals on 28 attempts. He 
also had 12 assists and 25 steals for 
the Tritons this year. 

Woodruff brought maturity to 
the squad, according to Harper. 

"He came in specifically to bring 
in some leadership:' Harper said. 
"He emerged his junior season as a 
significant person off of the bench, 
and if it wasn't for his individual 
performance in the championship 
game we wouldn't have beat Air 
Force. His senior year, he saw a lot 
more minutes and was willing to . 
accept his role for the good of the 
team. He was a big part of the 
whole formula of having the win-
ning season." 

Rosen has also played a solid 
ro le for the Tritons during his 

career, which is coming to an end 
this year due to controversial 

CAA ruling that ended his eligi-
bility. He had five goals on 12 shots 
last season for UCSD and notched 
12 assists and 25 steals. 

"Every team has guys that might 
not get big minutes but make an 
impact," Harper said. "He was hurt 
by the obscure NCAA ruling, 
which in a word, sucked, and 
which really took the wind out of 
Eric. But despite that, he never 
missed workouts, and he was a big, 
strong left-hander who brought a 
real maturity to the team. He has 
done incredibly well academically 
and had as much to do with our 
championship season as anyone 
else. I have a huge amount of 
respect for him and the role he 
accepted for this year to be a cham-
pionship year." 

The water polo program will 
miss the play of these athletes 
when they commence their 2001 
campaign . Their presence and 
leadership, both in and out of the 
pool, were invaluable to the squad 
during practices and games. Their 
effort and contributions to Triton 
polo were much appreciated by 
their teammates and coaches. 

It's e,asy to make a child smile. 
A few words of encouragement, 
maybe a special reward for a special 
performance. Parents do it all 
the time, and so do teachers. 

Good teachers are the difference 
between a child who succeeds and one 
who stumbles. They are the ones who 
make math fun and science seem like 
an adventure into another world . 

Teaching is the profession that allows 
you to see the most grat ify ing , 
immediate and instantaneous reward 
of a job well done - a child's smile. 

Make a child smile. 
Take the next step - teach! 

Make the difference 
of a lifetime.

The UCSD women's water polo 
team won one and lost one this 
weekend on the road. 

For the first game, the Tritons 
squeaked by UC Irvine, 7-6. 

UCSD held a 6-3 lead after 
three quarters. The Anteaters 
notched three points in the final 
period, but UCSD held off the 
threat with a goal of its own.

difference. 

Going into the match, LaPlante 
and her team were worried about 
Cal State Los Angeles' top player, 
Tammy Encina. That fear was war-
ranted as Encina won her match at 

10 . 1 singles against Lyndsey Tad-
lock and also won at No. 1 doubles 
with partner Vivian Yee. . 

But just like in the match against 
Point Loma, the Thtons 1V0n all the 
other contests and cruised to victory. 
In fact , no Triton gave up a set in any 
match other then the ones at No. 1. 

To LaPlante, the win was 
expected, and that is why she kept 
her best player out. 

"lWei kept 10' eill out again 
because we knew we could win 
without her and were trying to give 
her some extra days to rest and just 
hit a little," LaPlante said. "We were 
disappointed in the performance of 
the o. 1 doubles team, but every-
one else played great." 

trick for UCSD, and Samara Silver-
man, Maris Bantilan-Smith, Erin 
Welsh and Renae Coulter each 
contributed with a score. 

Triton goalkeeper Megan 
Hubbs saved nine shots. 

It was a different story for the 
Tritons against powerhouse Uni-
versity of Southern California. The 
Trojans won in a laugher, 18-1 . 

The game was 11 -1 in favor of 
the home team after three periods, 
which went on to score seven more 
goals in the fourth for the blowout. 

Under the looming threat of 
rain, the Tritons took the cO Ur! 
against Grand Canyon University 
on Saturday. Because it looked like 
the courts would soon be drenched, 
it was agreed that as soon as one 
team clinched the match, the rest of 
the match ups would be canceled. 

This arrangement worked out 
for the Tritons, winning the first 
five points for a 5-0 win . 

The Tritons swept the doubles 
competition with no team losing 
more than four games. Particularly 
impressive were Jansen and Mary 
Hung at No. 3 doubles. The duo 
cruised to a 8-0 victory. 

In singles, Hung won 6-1 ,6-0 at 
No. 5, and Stephanie Moriarty won 
6-1 , 6-4 at No. 4, giving the Tritons 
the sweep. 

LaPlante was particularly 
impressed with the play of her dou-
bles teams. 

"We played excellent in doubles 
and swept them," LaPlante said. 
"The No. 1 doubles team ca me out 
with a different attitude, and it 
showed. All the doubles played very 
well." 

The win set up a rematch with 
the UC Davis Aggics, the only team 

Erin Welsh scored the lon~ goa l 
for UCSD, and Hubbs picked up 
four saves. 

This weekend is of the utmost 
importance, as the Tritons partici-
pate in th e Women's Westcrn 
Water Polo Association Champi-
onships. UCSD will be hosting thl' 
event, which runs from Friday to

The Tritons performed b~llcr 
this time around agall1s t Davts, but 
it was not enough, as they 1I't'IT 
dealt a 6-3 loss. 

The Aggies took two of thl' 
th ree doubles sets. Only the :'\0. :;

to pull out a victory. 

In singles, Hung and j.lnscn

Bonds 

Stoner 
Steps 

ISAAC PEARLMAN 

B ack In the day, when I was a iTesh-faccd, innocent, dor-eyed high school lad {okay. 
actually a few years ago} my baseball 
coach once told everyone on my 
team to write an inspirallonal quote 
on the bill of our baseball hats. The 
quote I chose was "Ad\'erslty causes 
some men to break; others to break 
records." by William A. Ward. 

Last week in baseball, a record 
was broken by Barry Bonds, who 
1111 hts fifth home run in as many 
games to hit the 500 home ru n 
mlkstonc for his career. To lOp it all 
off, Bonds' SOOth was an absolute 
bomb 11110 the murky waters of the 
S.ln FranCISCO Bay. With a distance 
ranging anywhere from 415 fcc t to 
450 fecI. 1\ could be the longest 
SOOth home run ever. Such is the 
stuff legends an: made of. 

And Bonds. colossal prick that 
he is (this IS coming from a die-hard 
Giants fan). deserves our respect 
and adnmation for his amazing 
physical accomplishment. Though 
hiS ego may be the size of that giant 
glove in Pac Bell Stadium, he is a 
helluva baseball player and athlete 
{the two aren't always synonymous}. 

But Bonds does not deserve 10 
be a sports idol, fo r he is sorely 
lacking in those small, intangible 
aspects of being an athlete that add 
up to the difference between a 
great athlete and a SpOrlS legend. 
He has a poor altitude, he's a prick, 
he doesn't run out ground balls, 
he's surly 10 both the press and his 
tealilmates, he's a prick and he's 
watched what he thought was a 
home run bounce of the wall for a 
300-foot single enough times for 
me to scream, "Run, you bastard!" 
at c\ery weak fly ball he hits. 

ly POll1t here IS that while 
tod'IY'S athle tes can perform amaz-
II1g athletic feats in their respective 
sports, many of th em should not 
be Ido lized, due to the rampant 
number of oversized egos and 
ullderslzed personalities among 
superstars today. 

These supersized egos are due in 
some part 10 society, which has 
begun to market individuals over 
teams, which in turn has caused fans 
to support players instead of teams. 

Fan support has swelled athletes' 
egos to the size of Good Year blimps 
and given them the notion that they 
can do just about anything, includ-
ing break the law. And the media 
looks right past the jail record. 

If you ever want to view the 
man whom I consider to be a 
sports idol. take a look at Cal Rip-
ken Jr. He plays his hardest every 
ga me and set the record for con-
secutive games played a couple of 
years ago. His numbers alone 
ought to make him a first-ballot 
han-of-famer. But more than that, 
he 's a humble man who didn't 
have that much to say even when 
the national spotlight was on him. 
In the end, there are athletes a lot 
worse than Bond!, who isn 't snort-
ing cocaine or driving drunk (or at 
least not getting caught) . He would 
just rather be lazy and not utilize 
his whole potential. Prick.

Three Wins For Triton Tennis 
UCSD women down PLNU, CSULA and Grand Canyon University 
By BILL BURGER 
Senior Staff Writer 

Meatloaf said two out of three 
ain't bad, which means that the 
UCSO women's tennis team 
should be extatic with its three 
wins and one loss last week 
aga inst Point Loma Nazarene 
University and in California Col-
legiate Athletic Association tour-
nament competition . 

The Tritons started out the 
week with an easy victory over 
Poil1l Loma on Wednesday. The 
7-2 win was even more impres-
sive considering the fact that Tri-
ton No. 1 player Ashley O'Neil 
was out because of a hip flexor 
injury. O'Neil played in only one 
of the Tritons' matches last week. 

Although every team has to 
focus on the task at hand, the 
Tritons were obviously looking 
ahead to the conference tourna-
ment later that week. 

"As far as Point Lorna, there is 
not that much to say; said head 
coach Liz LaPlante. "It was a 
tune-up for cqnference." 

Up top, Point Loma was

Triton 
Softball 
Gears Up' 
Every game is 
important after three 
wins in Tournament 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD softball team need-
ed to kick some but! at last week-
end's 2001 Mountain Dew Softball 
Classic at Cal State Bakersfield. 

Unfortunately, the lhtons did 
not win the tournament, but with a 
3-2 record over the weekend, they 
showed that they ca n hang with 
the best of them. 

"That's what our conference is 
about." said UCSO hcad coach 
Patti Gerckens. "Any team can beat 
you on any given day." 

The tournament fea t ur~d 10 
schools, eight of them California 
Collegiate Athletic Associa tion 
schools, including the Tritons. The 
other two schools were Western 
Nevi Mexico University and West-
ern Washington University. 

UCSD fell in the semi-finals 1-
o agai nst the host school Cal State 
Bakersfield. The Roadrunners' 
pitcher Erin Kelly tossed a three-
hitter to sti fl e the Tritons. 

The loss ca me as a shock since 
UCSD duminated Bakersfield 7-3 
on the first day of the tournament. 
Leea Harlan pic~ed up the win for 
the Tritons in that contest. She also 
helped her own cause by launching 
a home run. Christina Searing 
slammed a homer as weIl. 

"We just hit the ball when we 
played Bakersfield the first time 
and the second time we didn't," 
Gerckens said. "We didn 't capital-
ize on opportunities. They did . We 
made one mistake defensively. 
They scored." 

The other two Triton victories 
came 5-0 against Western Wash-
ington and 2-0 over Cal State 
Stanislaus. 

UCSO's other loss was 4-1 to 
Cal State Dominguez Hills. 

"We had come to win the tour-
nament," . Gerckens said "You 
always go in planning to win the 
tournament. After beating Bakers-
field 7-3, I felt that we had a good 
shot at winning it." 

Two Tritons, Harlan and Sear-
ing, made the All-Tournament 
Team. 

"Christina just rea lly exploded 
ovcr the weekend," Gerckens said . 
"S he came through with big hits 
and she's a gamer. We have three 
more weeks and I think she's going 
to start hitting even better." 

The team hopes to fire on all 
cylinders the next couple of weeks. 

"Hopefully thge will be a big-
ger and better tournament in the 
future that we'll do better in," Ger-
ckens said. 

The "tournament" the coach is 
alluding to, of course, are the play-
offs. The Tritons are contenders for 
a berth in the postseason. 

"That's what we're hoping for 
and we're hoping we learned from 
this tournllment," Gerckens said. 

Now, every game is important 
for UCSD. 

This weekend, the Tritons will 
hit the road to face Cal State San 
Bernardino on Saturday at noon . 
On Sunday, the Tritons return 
home to host Western New Mexi-
co at 1 p.m.
