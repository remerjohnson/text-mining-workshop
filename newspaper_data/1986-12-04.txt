Alumni pressure 
Provost. to resign 
By MATIHEW WT, Nnvs Editor 

REPRESENTATIVES of the Third College Alumni Association have called for the resignation of Provost Faustina Solis because of her "handling" of Dean Varga's termination . 
"We are calling for Provost Solis' reSignation because we are 

appalled with the way she has handled the (Varga) case. She has 
consistently played members of the college otT against each other 
until there is nothing left but competing factions," Andy Schneider, 
Regional Representative of the Third College Alumni Association, 
said. 

The Alumni representatives believe that Solis played a major role in 
Third College Dean, Beverly Varga's termination . Their concern is 
that she acted unethically by persuading students to write negative 
letters about the Dean. 

One case, which the Alumni used to suppon their charge, is an 
incident which concerned last year's Third College Council Chairman 
Steven Cooper. According to several sources, Solis made a summer 
visit to San Francisco in order to ask Cooper, who did not get along 
with Varga during his term as chairman, to write a letter to the the 
Chancellor which criticized the Dean's performance. 

Provost Solis admitted that she went up to San Francisco to visit 
with Cooper, but declined to comment about the purpose of the trip . 
She did deny that she encouraged Cooper to write a letter. 

"What we really want is for the administration to conduct a fact-
finding investigation to look into the case, to check into the 
allegations of misconduct," Schneider said. 

"I spoke with Vice Chancellor Joe Watson and he said that the 
Administration does not intend to go through its normal procedure of 
having an investigation into the case ," Schneider said. 

Alumna Molly Farrell said, "I want an independent review board to 
investigate Solis' action because, if she did tell Cooper to write a 
letter, it's cor,spiracy to commit libel and that's a felony. With these 
allegations of falicious behavior, the administration damn well better 
find out what's going on." 

"I lind this type of logic strained: Watson replied. Watson said 
that he did not think that this case warranted an investigation; 
funhermore , he had not received anything in writing which 
requested an investigation. 

Concerning Solis' trip to San Francisco, Watson said, "I am not 
aware that this happened. (However,) I have no difficulty with 
someone telling somebody else to document their grievances in 
writing." 

"It's unfortunate that there is this issue (of Varga's termination), 
and it 's also unfortunate that a large number of people are being 
dragged into it," Watson said, 

The alumni said that they are ready to ask the State Legislature to 
establish an independent investigative committee to look into this 
case . Please tum to page 3

"The founding principles arc

Parking farce 
Each day a UCSD parking officer visits the Guardian/ Che Cafe 

parking lot. He usually pulls up in the middle of the access lane and 
proceeds to hang tickets on every vehicle he can fi nd In violation of 
any obscure Univers ity law, sometimes resorting to an improperly 
displayed pennit violation to fulfill his quota . 

This panicular day brought us a surprise . Parking Attendant F. 
W. Tood, badge number 65, \vas affixi ng a ticket toa vehicle for the 
ubIquitous crime of parking in an undesignated area. One of our 
staff reminded Todd that his UniverSity vehicle was also in 
violation of that law and demanded that it be cited. "Worry about 
your own vehicle ," he retorted . 

Is the Universit)'concemed with bringing to justice aU those who 
trespass against its numerous parking laws? During any given 
business day there are no less than five parking officers on dury 
simultaneously. The design of the parking lors makes their Job an 
easy one. The meters only.accept one type of coin and run out after 
a half hour. The accessable student parking spots are located a 
minimum of ten minutes away from any classroom aAd are 
becoming increasingly scarce as the administration continues to 
oversell permits by as much as 25-40 percent. The convenient ones 
are becoming more and more extinct as the parking office turns 
them into unused administrative spots. The parking officers have 
no trouble earning their keep when students are forced to choose 
berween parking "legally" and making their classes. 

A set of unofficial experiments and observations determined that 
while vehicles displaying the yellow student permits often received 
citations for petty violations, vehIcles with "A" permits or reserved 
pennits were not cited at all for illegal parking. Reserved permit 
number 001 was observed to be parked at an expired meter space 
most of the day. While surrounding "S" pennies were ci ted, this 
particular vehicle \vas not. Each day, University and Police vehicles 
can be found parking on side\valks, and other "undesignated" areas 
in flagrant violation of the laws with no worries of repercussions. 

If you have ever looked closely at a UCSD parking ticket, you 
would see that each seperate indictment is a violation of exactly the 
same section of the California Vehicle code, section 21113 .a, 
except the red zone violations which are in VIOlation of86.09.(e) of 
the San Diego MuniCipal Code But each charge carries a separate 
price, averaging between '!i12 and '!i 18. Another interesting feature 
of the parking CItation is that it assumes guilt unless one goes to the 
parking office and somehow proves his innocence. 

The logical conclusion of this is that the University cites vehicles 
nor for safery violations but for profIt. Administrators are not cited. 
of course, and illegally parking employees are not confronted . 
However, if a student dares to pan In one of the 40 or 50 unused "A" 
spors near Peterson Hall , he will suffer the swift and cold vengeance 
of the UCSD ParkIng Office. This must change! ~

Ronniegate 
Editor: 

On the surfa e, Reagangate 
does nor appear to be as serious 
as Watergte . so say people like 
Geroge Will and others. I believe 
\l'S much worse. Watergate was 
the case of the break-In of the 
Democratic Headquaners. the 
illegal wnetapping. the hes, and 
the bIg cover-up. Watergate was 
confined to the domestic arena. 
It was aU internal polmcs. 

Reagangate on the other hand, 
Involved the a!lonal Sccurity 
Council. the White House's 
fo reign policy apparatus, the 
White House . the tatc 
Department. the ClA, the FBI, 
Is rael , Iran, Switzerland , and the 
Contras. Like Watergate, 
Reagangate Involves serious 
violations of the law. Reagan 
shipped arms to Iran In 
contradiction to hIS stated policy 
of not dealing with terrorist 
states. In the initial moments of 
this disaster, President Reagan 
lied about certain aspects of the 
operation to the press. When the 
real story began to leak, we saw 
complete chaos at the White 
House - the staff distancing 
themselves from the President , 
the tate Depanment send ing 
written corrections of Reagan's 
press conferences, and worst of 
aU, contradictory statements 
coming from five or six 
spokesmen within the White 
House. 

In a dlVersionaty tactic. 
Reagan tried to save face by 
saying, whethcr true or not. that 
he wasn't aware or wasn't 
informed of cenai n aspects of 
the "initiative ." By doing this, he 
has shIfted auentlOn away from 
his blundcrs to the Iran, Israel , 
Contra connectlon. It was qUite 
effectlve, but Reagan still loses. 
By admitting he wasn't aware of 
this . he has paInted the picture 

of a President with no control 
over his people, no control of 
.the hIghest office in the land . 

The bottom line is this: 
Reagangatc has spilled out of the 
domestic arena. The scandal 
involves all the top men in the 
Administration , keeping secrets 
from Congress, channeling arms 
to Iran, lies, deceit, and cover-
up. Any legitimacy in U.S. 
foreign policy has been 
completely eroded by this fiasco. 
In terms o f adverse effects on the 
United Sta tes, Reagangate seems 
far more destructive than 
Watergate because of the 
international scope of the 
operation , its effects on u.s. 
allies, and U.s. credibility in 
generaL

Verbal Terrorism 
Editor: 

I must applaud Raafat Georgy's 

opinion in the November 24 
Guardian in his defense of 
freedom of speech rights for the 
Organization of Arab Students. It 
is healthy for several sides of a 
delicate issue such as terrorism 
to be promulgated to the student 
body. Within the context of 
Georgy's argumentation in his 
Guardian letter, and in his recent 
presentation , however , lies three 
points which must be addressed. 

First, Georgy's statement that 
"It is not surprising that an 
Israe li would speak with such 
hatred tOwards Arabs," in 
reaction to Dr. Yoram Dinstein's 
lecture of terrorism and world 
violence, is nothing shon of a 
vicious, bigoted stereorype on 
the verge of anti-semitism. This 
fo rm of rhetoric is typical of 
Georgy's propoganda in 
denunciation of the nation and 
state of lsrael. One must not 

Pleast tum to page .5 

• 

lfTTfHSlfTTfHS 
Continued from page .. 
assume that Israe lI s hate Arabs, 
Just as it mus t not be assumed 
that Arabs hate Israeli s. Such 
rheto ric does nor adhere to an 
ideology of a peaceful co-
existcnce in the Middle East, 
and his verbal "terrorism" implies 
that peace may not be his goal. I 
hope it is. though . 

Second, his definition of 
terrorism stressed the attacks of 
Israeli t1efense forces on various 
Arab towns and villages 
inhabited by religious extremists 
and moderate civilians, but 
notice that when he discussed 
Arab terrorism against Americans 
or other innocent people , the 
·condemnation of Arab 
terrorism" became irrelevant 
within the body of his definition . 
Georgy must consider that if the 
recent Palestinian stabbing of an 
innocent Jewish student in 
Jerusalem - while several of the 
Arab residents in the Muslim 
quaner remained-complacent 
and watch the tragedy - is any 
less relevant than the Israelis' 
unintentional killing of Arab 
ivilians while trying to bomb 

PLO strongholds, then he must 
go back to Central Library to fine 
tune his definition. 

Finally, Georgy painted a 
histori cal picture of the past fony 
years of Palestinian history in 
whieh his people suffered from 
the aggressive action of Israeli 
military in the West Bank. This 
is a point well taken and 
understood , but nor well 
received. Consider that for more 
than three thousand years Jews 
were persecuted, scapegoated 
and murdered because of their 
culture and identity. The six 
million Jews that were 
slaughtered in the Holocaust is a 
major piece of evidence of the 
moral debt that was paid to 
establish Israel in 1948, as the 
United States and the rest of the 
world turned their backs on the 
Jewish refugees suffering in the 
diaspora. The goal of this letter, 
however, is not to weigh the 
scales of Jewish versus 
Paleslianian suffering. Its purpose 
is to expose the quasi-anti-
semitism in Raafat's dialogue, the 
double-standard pitfall of his 
propagandized definition , and 
the significance of Jewish 
historical oppression so that 
opinIon can be shaped in a fair 
manner. 

Plans and discussion of peace 
in the Middle East must take a 
front scat on the agenda of 
future UCSD speakers regardless 
of whether the Associated 
Student s or ot her political bodies 
sponsor the necessary voices to 
be heard. But JUSt as crucial , the 
UC D student body must reject 
Raafat's definition of terrori sm 
and hIS ste reotypc of Israelis 
because it is nothing short of 
"verbal terrorism," hinging on the 
ideology of a quasi-communi t 
dupe.

AS President 
addresses 
campus affairs 
By MARK FLEISCHMAN 
"S TUDENTS need [Q be 

wa tchdogs of AS. 
actions." Associated 

Students President Joh n Riley 
said in the second of hi s ' tate 
of the Campus" speeches 
yesterday at noon in Revelle 
plaza in fro nt of a crowd of 200. 
Dave Marchick, Commisioner of 
Operations, Enterprises and 
Services, and Eric Weiss, Vice-
President External Affairs. also 
took the microphone in an 
attempt [Q inform students of 
A.5. activi ties. 

After congratulating several of 
UCSD's intercollegiate athletic 
teams for their recent 
accomplishments, President Riley 
concentrated on student services 
and facilities. "As the student 
body expands, so must student 
se rvices and facilities." 

Riley said that the students 
muSt assess the effectiveness of 

AS. President John Riley stressed 
thaJ students m US! act as I I or t 
'watchdogs" to mahe the council 

aware oj campus concerns. 

existing services and 
communicate direcdy with the 
A.S. in order to take positive 
action in the expansion of 
services and facilities, One 
hundred and seventy dollars of 
each student's registration fees 
are used for maintaining and 
improving student services and 
facilities and students should 
have an active role in 
determining how the money is 
allocated. 

After Riley, Marchick tOok the 
podium. Concentrating primarily 
on the parking situation 
Marchick said, "Student opinion 
is not being heard. Students are 
not getting their moneys worth 
and, not surprisingly, the future 
of the parking situation does not 
look optimistic." Even with the 
addition of several new or re-
zoned lots, student parking is 
still deficient. 

The effects of Proposition 56 
on student services and the 
growing need for expansion was 
Weiss' primary focus of 
discussion . Of the $86 million 
given to the state of California 
for the expansion of public 
educational facilities , UCSD 
received $30 million. The reason 
UCSD received such a large 
amount is that it is the fastest 
growing university in California . 
The money is to be used for the 
construction of academic and 
research facilities. 

Riley plans to co'ntinue these 
monthly "state of the campus· 
speeches throughout the year in 
order to keep students informed 
of campus events and activities. 

Marchick went as far as to 
propose a 20<1'0 space lot to be 
located near APM, Peterson Hall , 
and Mandeville Auditorium. He 
also stressed the importance of 
remstating the nickle , dime and 
quaner parking meters. Ii::]

A sure cure 
By KEllY L. SULLIVAN 

I N the 'mini-world' here at UCSD, students are set apart in a lot of ways from 'real 
life: Approximately 5,500 of us 
live here on campus, eat UC D 
Food Services' grub, and plan 
our lives around class times. We 
get so caught up in homework 
and studying that we often don't 
find time. JUSt as In the outside 
world , because of family. work, 
etc., to stop and chat or lend a 
listening ear. We are in a very 
high stress atmosphere here and 
there is a need to establish a 
balance - to level out the high 
stress with a friendly, relaxed 
atmosphere. 

Why is the level of stress 0 
high here? The most obvIOUS 
reason is the work placed upon 
us We should nJt complain 
about the workload , of course, 
because we chose to come here 
in the first place. Writing a 
paper, typing a paper. cramming 

for a mid-term, or even Just 
thinking about doing these 
things oftcn awakens the 
butterflies in our stomachs. 
Trying to work while carrying a 
full load is almost more of an 
accomrlishment than scaling the 
face 0 Half Dome at Yosemite. 
Every Single minute of your day 
seems to be filled , and there is 
absolutely no time to spend by 
yourself and hardly any time at 
all to catch a wink of sleep. It is 
not just the schedule of the day 
that causes stress, but the lack of 
lime you have to yourself and 
even to share with olhers once 
In a while that can really make 
you tense 

And then of course there IS 
the freshman who often belongs 
in a stress category of his ol' ·n. 
He is away from home for the 
first time in most cases and 
finds himself overwhelmed with 
information, deadhnes and SOCial

last with only a W to sho~ . Our 
college careers flash belore our 
eyes as our pa re ntS lecture us to 
do well and study hard so we 
can make it through in four 
years. We must face the reality 
that we have to go through class

we have to have . Studying,

co me to bombard and worry us 
as we tend to close ourselves up

I have a proposal that could 
actually help to release tension

atmosphere on campus. It tS 
actually a very Simple, effi ient, 
no-cost solution: simply to 
realize th e problem and to act 
upon it by smili ng a little more 
often and stopping to talk once

talk about chool. 

I have noticed the need for a 
little more friendliness in the air, 
and I have decided to bring it to 
the attention of all. I think that it 
will take very little effort on the 
pan of each one of us 
individually to find a happy 
medium between such a stressful 
atmosphere and a more friendly, 
relaxed air here on campus. So 
how about giving it a try. ~

Music 
Continued from page 8 
Hcrshenson IS rhe father of the 
sofrware which the students w,1l 
usc . Although the music is 
programmed, Kanner and Leeper 
won't be following the rigid 
constraints of a pre-recorded 
formula. "We are leaving pans of 
this performance open to 
improvisation," Kanner said. 

The unique aspects of this 
project are manifold. For one, 
Kanner and Leeper are using 
quadraphonic sound combined 
with computer technology to 
create an ambient, rich. sound-
filled environment. "This is one 
of the first times thar the 
emulator'S been used live at 
school in this way," Leeper said . 
The emulator is a digital 
sampling computerized 
s),nthesizer, (the instrument that 
Stevie Wonder had such a good 
time playing on th e Cosby 
Show). 

The two students are also 
using a wide array of musical 
technology available to them. 
Experimenting with a 
combination of the new and the 
old , Leeper and Kanner wilf be 
using the high tech emulator in 
conjunction with an analog - a 
non-computerized syntheSizer. 
"We want to show that old 
technology does nOt have to 
become obsolete. either do the 
old and new have to be 
antithetical to one another. 
Music is a mix of bOth: Kanner 
said . 1m

Football 
'Continued from page 1 
suppOrt. "With football 
intramurals JUSt ending, and all 
the football on TV, the time IS 
right to get a team gOing," said 
Flores. 

The main concern of the 
athletic administration , is the 
funding of such a venture . "It 
certainly is something worth 
looking at," said UCSD Athletl 
Director Judith Sweet, "but I have 
to be cautious about what It'S 
going to take to fmance a 
football program. We don 't want 
to drain any resources from any 
programs already in existance. 

According to Kobyashi, an 
extra $5 a quarter tacked on to 
registration fees would help get 
the football team 01T the ground , 
which includes covering such 
costs such as eqUipment, 
coaches salaries, and facilities. 
But to trigger anything, Kobyashl 
mentions student suppOrt as the 
key element. "I'm hearing more 
and more from students to move 
towards activities that bri ng the 
school closer together," said 
Kobyashi. "I think football can 
do that, but there has to be a 
strong student movement to 
support it. Without that supporr, 
the issue is not there." 

More than any other spon in 
America, football brings people 
together. "There's something 
about it : says Father Patrick 
Cahill. "I don't know if It'S 
because it's outside or what it is ." 

Father Cahill was not sought 
for his divine guidance on the 
matter of football , rather he is 
the Athletic Director at USD, a 
school that resorred its division 
III program in 1975. "We get 
bigger crowds at our diviSIOn III 
football games than we do at our 
diVision I basketball games," he 
says. "It 's kind of the place to be 
whenever we have a game:' Like 
UCSD, the football program at 
USD was dissolved in the sixties. 
In the early seventies, though , a 
club team was sta rted by some 
students, and it grew into a 
division III team again in '75. 

But , because it IS a private 
sc hool , the si tuatIon at USD IS 
qui te different than UCSD's. To 
look for a valid comparison, II IS 
necessary to nnd a west-coast 
public university, preferably a 
UC, that has a moderately sized 
student body who enJoys 
participation in spOrtS, and that 
has staned a football program 
within the past couple of years. 
Impossible , you say? Nope, UC 
Santa Barbara is Just such a 
school. 

The UCSB Gauchos also had a 

football program that was 
stoppcd In thc late Sixties. But In 
the Fall of 1983 a few football-
loving students sta rtcd a club. 
They bought somc used 
equipment with their own 
money, fonncd a rag-tag tcam, 
and played games with anybody 
they could find . By spring of thc 
school year, they managed to get 
an initiative on the student 
ballot. They werc asking for four 
dollars and fifty cents to bc 
added to each student's fees In 
order to suppOrt a division III 
football program, and a two-
th irds majority was needed for it 
to pass . It failed . 

"People really didn't know 
about it," explained ChriS 
Humphreys , hncbacker on the 
current team The tumout for thc 
election was VCIY low, and some 
other interests on cam pus 
opposed the initiative. Rugby, 
lacrosse , and crew all ·had 
established clubs at the school, 
and claimed it would be unfair. 

But the football club got bigger 
and more organized in the fall of 
'84 , and was ready for another 
stude nt vote the next spri ng. 
"We pushed It a lot harder this 
time, giving out flyers , putting up 
signs " said Humphreys. And 
this time it passes. 

Last month marked the end of 
the Gaucho's first season as they 
finished at 4-5. At first , 
attendance dragged a bit for the 
footba ll team. "Our students arc 
all at the beach or playing frisbee 
during the day," said UCSB 
Athleti c Director Stan Morrison. 
So the team playcd a couple of 
night games and the crowd size 
increased dramatically. "We have 
to accommodate the students," 
MOrrison said . 

For their homecoming, the 
Gauchos got a few hundred 
studcnts for the pregame bonfire 
and drew eight thousand for the 
game. Both Humphreys and 
Morrison agree the team has 
improved school spirit. "People 
are real laid back here ," 
Humphreys said . "It's definitely a 
unifying factor." 

At UCSD football is the next 
logical. step. The athletic program 
has become the best in the 
nation , and Kobyashi feels that a 
football team would do 
everything to enhance the quality 
of student life at UCSD, and help 
unify the campus which must 
deal with a four college system. 

A committee is being set up 
for students interested in the 
football issue. A winter or spring 
referenda is already in the works , 
according to AS President John 
Riley. "It's something we are 
really Interested in and I suppOrt 
bnnglng a football team on 
campus complctely." Iill

Tritons 
crush 
Redlands 
By DARREN KjELDSEN 

I F Dick Vitale ever talked about Division III women's basketball teams, he would 
definitly ca ll UCSD a team to 
look out for. A lot of returning 
talent mixed in with some solid 
new people should make Judy 
Malone's team a strong 
contender for the NCAA West 
Regionals. 

The Tritons return both guards 
to their staning line-up, as well 
as both forwards. Shandra Elzy, 
the point guard, along with off 
guard Sandy Keaton make up an 
excellent backcoun, especially 
defensively. Chris McCallum will 
rerum to stan at one forward 
slot, and Heidi Jungling will 
return a little later in the year 
after she recovers from an injury. 
In her absence , sophomore Shelli 
Velie will play forwa rd most of 
the time. Tracy Ragatz will add 
excellent perimeter shooting of 
the T ritoins, at the forward 
pOSition . 

Fo,ward Shelll Veil. 

As far as the new faces on the 
team, sophomore center Jill 
Koster, fresh from volleyball , 
heads the list. First year players, 
Chris Ely from Salt Lake City 
and Camille Zeiter from 
Stockton, are workillg their way 
,dong. 

UCSD should be one of the 
tOP Division 1lI teams in 
California. "The problem IS: says 
coach Malone, "is that we can't 
PUt TWO good halves together." 

Last Tuesday night, the Tritons 
were able to put TWO halves of 
good basketball in their 62-40 
thrashing of University of 
Redlands. Jungling poured in 15, 
while Koster added 14 points in 
the victory. The Tritons go into 
next weeks contest with Whinier 
College with a 3-3 record . Iill

UCSD upsets USIU 
I Na major upset, the UCSD men's basketball team defeated USIU 106-95. 
Although United States 
International UnIversity is a 
division I school and came in 
heavily favored , the Tritons were 
able to jump out to an early lead 
and maintain it throughout the 
game. 

The game was the opener at 
USIU's new home coun, Golden 
Hall, but the Gulls came up with 
a silver inedal performance in a 
twO team contest. The key to 

their success this season is 
supposed to be tbe three point 
shot. They hit only 19.2 percent 
from behind the line, wi th their 
star player, Joe Yezbak, making 
only one of twelve three pointers. 

The Tritons, on the other 
hand, gOt some great olTensive 
performances from th ree players 
- Brian Backe ns, Greg 
Kamansky, and Joh n Saintigon. 
Backens fi nish cd wi th 30 pOi nts, 
Kama nsky had 28 with Saintigon 
kicking in 24. 

UCSD is now 3-2. ~

---THE SPIKING SPUDSNOllEYBAll REPORT----
(Playoff PreVIew and Prognost!catwns) 

It's been a long season, hasn't it? I mean really. When we starred thi mess back in early 
October, everybody was 0-0 and looking good! ow it's December, can you beheve it? SI. 
Nick is working fUriously Up north and the 1M Czars have been dOIng a fair amount of 
scrambling themselves. After all, it's 1M Volleyball Championship week, and there are 63 
hopefuls serving It up thiS week in the cam pus gyms looking for a chance to claim a 
dhllsiomil title and the righ t to yell "We're number one." 

1M Men's and Women's Volleyball setanother ne parriclpation record this season with 
124 teams participating weekly. Sixty three of them started the Play-ofT phase last Monday 
evening and as you read this, only 17 of them will still be playing. Come Sunday evening, 

. only five of them will be bragging their way around campus. 
Here's a quick capsule summary of who are Spuds' favorites to reach the finals. 

MEN·SAAA ................................ . 
GREEN MACHINE (19-2) 
Too much power, tOO much vb background, maybe not enough hearr, but still the best. 
SURF DAWGS 
All-World setter Eddie Machado leads this motley bunch , and he alone may make It 
possible . 
MEN·SAA __________________ _ 

FREE SEX wrm MATT (20-1) 
If they had a setter with hands. this team would be unstoppable. 
SOMETHlNG'S GOIN' DOWN (18-3) 
Wasden , Moore, and Carter give these guys a real shot at an upset 

MEN'SA,~ .............................. ... 
XERXES (19-2) 
This Persian powerhouse has been in the 'A' wars too long. If they don't win it this year, it's 
back to the Middle East for you guys. 
TEAM liliN' (I 7-3) 
Spuds' sleeper dark horse pick of the play-ofCs. This 2nd place finisher should surprise 
more than just a few. 

WOMEN'S M~ ................ I!1111 .......... _ 
LlTTLE NAPPY'S DROPOUTS (19-2) 
With Pontius and Haire pounding the middle, Lovely Lisa and Lauri hitting cross-court 
and Christy Wada setting the ball in the wheelhouse, you can't miss with this bunch. A 
sure-fire bet-the-ranch type of pick. 
BEACH ITt (13-2) 
Rebecc,a Steinle's crew can playa lot but they don 't match up with the Dropouts. 

WOMEN'S ~ ____ ~ ___________ _ 

SPIKED KOOL AID (l8-0) 
o one's touched this team yel, maybe they should move up to AA where there's some real 

competition. 
TEKIllYA POPPERS (19-2) 
Alisa Curry's group can be dangerous when they walk on the COUIt. If anyone can know off 
the Kool Aid Kids, it'll be these. 

---INTRAMURAl FlAG FOOTBAll BOWl REVlEW--. 
ANIMAL BOWl - Yorlr Hunt Club 40, The Herd 13. 
When you think of the Green Bay Packers, the Pittsburgh Steelers and the York Hunt Club, 
the word dynasty comes to mind. The Hunt Club won its f~ulth Animal Bowl tide by 
crushing The Herd 4<J-13. From the first play of the game, a 50 yard touchdown (0 Brad 
Mack, the game was never a contest. But this will most likely be the end of the dynasry. Due 
to graduation, and age, most of the stars of the Hum Club will be moving on to greener 
pastures. It's been a great run guys. 
BANANA BOWL - W/ Out Wood 27, P=MD II 19; Overtime. 
Possibly the game of the day. This was the first overtime game in a bowl final since 1978. 
The medies from the med school had read my article expounding on how they were going 
to get cut up by the fellas from W IoU! Wood. They came with fire in their eyes and a scalpel 
in their hands ready to dissect W lout Wood. W l out Wood was ready to win another 'M ' 
Championship. Heck, they JUSt read their press clippings It was gonna be a breeze. The 
Budman as usual created a lerrificgame with the power of the pen. The underdog became a 
rabid dog, and the favorite became docile , 
CADAVER BOWl - Crosseytd 6- Painitss 20, T!juaruJ Via 18. 
The dream match up of Numbers' one and two teams. The only undefeated , untied teams 
OUt of sevel1ry-eight 'A' football teams. This doesn't happen very of len that twO undefeated 
teams are matched )JP in the final game. The game lived up to Its billing. It was a real thriller 
to the end. Down by eight points Wlth less than a minute 10 play, Tijuana Vice's Mike 
Aguilera made a brilliant run through the entire Crosseyed team 10 put his team within two. 
The extra pomt would lie it and send the game into overtime. Well , l[ looked hke the game 
was gomg to go .to oventme as a Vice Player was wide open for the conversion . But OUt of 
nowhere came a Crosseyed player to knock the ball and Vice's chances for victory away. 
CUMAX BOWl - Ttllm Desperado 42, Roche Swatters 12. 
This game was predicted to be a rout , and it was. Team Desperado had finished second 
more times than the Mmnesota Vikings. They Just weren't going 10 be denied thiS time. 
There haven't been 100 many limes that the women on a team have been as good as the 
guys. But that was the case on the Desperados. Led by Mary Beth Murray and Karen 
Prather, they walked over the Roche Swatters. There wasn't a woman , nor a man on the 
Swa tters that could cover the women of the Desperados A Side light to thiS game was the 
slgmficance of the Roche Swatters team name. The name was meant to tell the Desperados 
that they would swat Doug Roche all over the field when they played them. The leadmg 
scorer in the game by the way was, you guessed It, Doug Roche With three touchdowns . 
SOUL BOWL - Dielts 6- Dikes 27, Sluggos O. 
ThiS game was about as ex tttngaswatchinga tree grow. Thank good ness forthe Madeline 
Schnieder show from Di cks & Dikes or the fans would have fallen asleep. She played a 
great game as did her team . It was the Sluggos that were JUSt God awful boring. I've seen 
glaciers move faster than that tcam does. They actually gOt a grand IOtal of two first downs 
the entire game, both on penalties. ThiS was stone age football at liS worst. How the heck 
did they gel mto the final is Whal I want to know

discovery of the "Speed

produced, directed and co-
written by Bob Rogers and

Rogers, who had worked in

If the Disney organization 
decides to present Rainbow 
War, it will be a personal 
victory for Rogers, not only 
because he was fired from the 
studio, but also, according to 
Rogers, because historically 
this has never been done. 
Disney has done outside work 
and shown it (in either 
Disneyland or DisneyWorld), 
but never has Disney decided 
to present anything outside of 
a Disney production." 

Rainbow WaT , which 
screens several times daily 
from December 4 through 
January 4, is probably one of 
the best movies that win be 
shown this winter break. 
Everyone should see Rainbow

Recognizing 
an 

alumnus 
by michael brown 

San Diego has historically 
alienated artists with the same 
dexterity that it lures jet 
fighters and beach-bound 
tourists. Artists tend to be 
underwhelmed by the city's 
assortment of art galleries. 

But San Diego's relative 
void of galleries appears to be 
a cultural oversight of the 
past . Numerous galleries have 
opened recently and the 
upcoming decade promises 
many more. Galleries such as 
the Installation Gallery, 
UCSD's Mandeville Gallery 
and those of the increasingly 
lively Gaslamp District will 
undoubtedly pump new life 
into San Diego's art 
community. 

The Gallery of Weird New 
Art, a recent addition to the 
Gaslamp District, will make a 
solid contribution to this 
trend December 6-27 when it 
presents the work of UCSD 
alumnus Christopher Canole. 

Canole, who attended the 
California Institute for tile 
Arts after graduation from 
UCSD, gained notoriety for 
his landscape sculptures in 
the late 70s. His work , 
primarily humorous pieces 
constructed out of the 
environment, has earned 
him favorable reviews in 

publications such as The Los 
Angeles Times . 

In the midst of enjoying 
international recognition, 
Canole decided to delve into 
literature in order to broaden 
his horizons; a decision that 
led him to UCSD's graduate 
literature program. He was 
going through an artist's mid-
life crisis: fear of not 
communicating and having 
nothing to say. 

Canole's up coming 
exhi bi t, Scultora / Scultore, 
marks his return to art and 
offers convincing evidence 
that his sabbatical paid 
dividends . His forceful, 

engagingly confident work 
demonstrates both an 
understanding of art history 
and a feeling for the internal 
drives and struggles of an 
artist. 

Working from sections of a 
50 year-old chain link fence 
intertwined with imposing 
vines, the ardently talkative 
artist manages to create 
amazingly powerful sculp-
tures with a minimum of 
adaptation. 

Scultora / Scultore will 
feature four sculptures and 
two riveting drawings. The 
Gallery of Weird New Art -is 
located on 18 Gaslamp Court 
at 739 Fifth Ave.

Sleeping alone 
Bruce Feirstein is a man 

with a mission - to make 
people laugh about what it 
means to be a man or a woman 
in the 80's. In his latest book, 
Nice Guys Sleep Alone, the man 
who defined real men as non-
quiche eaters takes on the 
surprises and dangers of 
dating in our modern society. 
Among the several topics he 
discusses are various types of 
dating, including "stunt 
dating" and "sudden death 
dating," the "greatest lies of 
extramarital affairs," and the 
correct way to read the 
personal ads: "male adonis" 
translates into "recently 
joined a health club." But 
underneath the jokes and 
Sarcasm lies a very serious 
author who brings a vast 
amount of experience into his 
work. 

Born in Maplewood, New 
Jersey, Feirstein attended 
Boston University'S School of 
Journalism where he served as 
editor of the daily college 
newspaper. After working in 
advertising for a few years, 
Feirstein co-wrote the Preppie 
Handbook, then made his solo 
debut with Real Men Don't Eac 
Quiche. Now based in Los 
Angeles, he has written 
several screenplays for 
television and movies. His 
first novel is in the planning 
stage. 

For Feirstein, the idea to 
base his books on iocial satire 
came naturally after being an 
observer of people for many 
years. "One day," Feirstein 
commented, "it struck me 
how hard it was to start a 
relationship. I think we live in 
an age of artificial hearts. I 
decided to write about dating, 
because if you think about it, 
if women really wanted to find

men like Phil Donahue, then 
they would marry oatmeal." 

According to Feirstein, 
Nice Guys Sleep Alone aims not 
only to satirize dating, but also 
to parody the proliferation of 
self-help books on the 
market. He says, "I love it 
when 55 year-old ' women 
write about how to get d~tes. 

They tell you that you can 
meet people at the museumj in 
this respect, it's not so 
different from meeting people 
at a bar, the only difference 
being whether you get a drink 
or you get a Renoir." 

Feirstein adds, "I think our 
society does have problems 
with male/female self-images. 
If it didn't, people like Phil 
Donahue and Oprah Winfrey 
would be out of business. But 
ultimately, things have a way 
,of working themselves out. 
Things are alwa ys improvable, 
and there's always hope." 

One of Feirstdn 's first 
published articles was a piece 
that he wrote for Glamour 
magazine. Ever -since that 
"big" break, he has written 
articles for the New Republic,

These concerts, under the 
uircction of Choral Director 
David Chase, will take place 
on Saturday, December 6, at8 
p.m., and Sunday, December 
7, at 3 p.m . tickets are $5 for 
adults and $3 for seniors and 
students. Call 534-4637 to 
make reservations or for 

the Washington Post, and the 
New Yark Times. With such a 
varied past and promising 
future, Feirstein has definitive 
ideas on how to be a happily 
published author: "No matter 
what you want to be, a 
filmmaker, a newspaper 
reporter, or a fiction writer, 
the most important thing to 
realize is that you can't learn 
how to do it in the classroom. 
You have to go out and do 
things." 

He says, " I'd be more 
inclined to hire someone with 
a well rounded education with 
a few writing courses under 
his belt than someone who 
only studied writing for four 
years. Most writers I know 
started out on college 
(news)papers, which are great 
because they give you an 
opportunity to make 
mistakes. Once the basics are 
down, the story is only as 
good as the elements you 
bring into it." 

With his current work in 
television and movi.es 
underway and his novel due to 
be finished in two to three 
years, Feirstein, sometimes 
has a few moments to himself 
to reflect on the fact that he 
has found his niche in a very 
competitive profession: "I've 
been writing for a long time. 
But sometimes I wake up in 
the morning and I realize, my 
God, I get paid to write! It's 
very difficult, certainly a lot of 
work and it's not a very social 
profession. Sometimes I think 
that it's a miracle that I'm 
making a living at it." 

The American book-
buying public will certainly be 
hearing much more from 
Bruce Feirstein. His book, 
NiLe Guys Sleep Alone, retails 
for $4.95 .

Looking at Lowen 
by lara mihata and jeffrey kleen 

The Mandeville Gallery is 
currently showing selected 
works of the Lowen 
Collection from the Los 
Angeles Contemporary 
Museum of Art through 
December 14. The purpose of 
this exposure, according to 
Mandeville Gallery Director 
Gerry McAllister, is to 
"Acquaint San Diegans with 
the opening of the new 
Museum of Contemporary 
Art in Los Angeles," which 
will occur December 10. 

The exhibit contains works 
by 11 artists, inc:;luding Julian 
Schnabel, David Salle, 
Malcolm Morley, and Ansel 
Kiefer. The collection consists 
of paintings, sculptures, 
photographs, and draWings 
from three decades: the 
1960's and 1970's (Minimal-
ism, Neo-Expressionism, and 
New Image, Painting), and the 
1980's (Post-Minimalism and 
Post Modernism). 

David Salle's work, A Long 
Life, is the most thought-
provoking of the collection. 
This piece. made in 1981, 

follows Salle's style of acrylic 
on canvas. Anselm Kiefer'S 
1977 work, Wege 1, is one of 
the more provocative pieces,

linen.

Byrning the truth

The film's strength is in its 
stereotypes. The charact~ts

do th claim to be. They are 
eccentric, exciting and often 
mundane tid-bits of all people 
in all towns. There; it,.t~"

The most sympathetic

He shows us people who's 
version of the "Wild, Wild 
Life" is a hp-sync contest at a 
local club, or a fashion show 
at the local mall where the 
emcee breaks into song: "00 
you know who you are? 
You're the dream operator." 
These people do hold the key 
to their dreams, but they are 
chained by their inherent 
jgnorance of reality. They are 
haplessly taken by consumer-

Trekking to San Francisco 
Star Trek IV; The Vayage 

Home is a good Star Trek 
movie, and on top of that, it's 
a good movie. They have 
returned to Star Trek: the 
series. In other words,' they're 
saving the Earth again. 

The plot has several holes, 
two of which are large, but 
(unfortunatel y) necessary. 
They account for what 
happened during the second 
and third movies, and give us a 
sense of drama and urgency. 
Roughly, the plot concerns an 
alien device that is going to 
destroy the Earth in the 23rd 
century, unless the Enterprise 

by robert leone ., 
crew is able to convince the 
said probe that this is a bad 
idea. The catch is that to do 
this, Admiral Kirk and 
Company must go to the 
Earth of the late 20th century; 
1986, to be precise. 

Humor has played an 
important part in Star Trek 
ever since the network 
premiere of the series twenty 
years ago. Star Trek IV is no 
exception. However, it's also 
high drama. Destruction of 
the Earth is about as dramatic 
as a movie can get, but this 
drama/ cross-temporal co-
medy is delicious, as the 

enterprising crew use their wits 
to playa complex game of 
bluff, blarney, and outright 
theft in order to get what they 
want. 

Thematically, this movie is 
as heavy-handed as the TV 
episodes, but that's OK. This 
is a Star Trek movie. The 
movie does not require 
exacting knowledge of the 
series and the past movies, but 
being acquainted with them is 
a good idea. 

Star Trek IV; The Vayage 
Home is a nice crowd-pleaser; 
it's sure to do good business 
over the holidays. 

Live 
with the 

Boss 
by mark pinkus 

The Boss is back, and just in 
time for the holidays. Bruce 
Springsteen, along with his E 
Street Band, is the first person 
in ten years to release an 
album that topped the charts 
in its very first week of being 
out. What makes this 
accomplishment all the more 
amazing is that, not only is it a 
live album (which usually 
does not sell as well as a studio 
album), but a five record set. 
To answer the skeptics that 
might wonder if this 
collection is really that good: 
just listen to the 200 minutes 
of music (all for the great price 
of around twenty-five dollars) 
on LIVE/ I975~85; you will 
realize it is even better than 
what people are saying. 

"Thunder Road," the first 
of forty songs, features 
Springsteen solo, playing the 
piano and harmonica at The 
Roxy, a small Los Angeles 
club, in 1975. The slow, 
beautiful version sets the 
mood for the album which has 
recordings from '75 and '78 
club appearances; '80, '81 a.nd 
'84 concert tours; and the 
most recent '85 stadium 
shows . . Springsteen, often 
considered the best American 
live performer ever, creates 
such an overwhelming feeling 
at his shows that, prior to the 
album's release, it was 
~uestioned whether that 
passion could successfully be 
carried over onto vinyl (or 
disc). 

Seven previously unre-
leased songs, including 
"Fire," uBecause the Night," 
and an accoustic version of 
Woody Guthrie's classic 
"This Land Is Your Land" 
make the collection that much 
more valuable. Three songs 
from the Nebraska album, 
along with "No Surrender" 
(plus the two previously 
mentioned ones) are the only 
taste we get of Springsteen's 
~ptivating way of doing songs 
in his solo style. "No 
Surrender," which he opens 
up with by saying, "Here's 
one for friendship," offers a 
version of the song which is SO 

powerful it could bring any 
two people together as 
friends. 

Whenever a major artist 
releases a compilation album, 
fans always complain about 
the songs left out. "Point 
Blank," "For You, " and 
"Prove It All Night" are left 
off the album; however, the 
rarely done live songs, "The 
River," "Jersey Girl," and 
"Tenth Avenue Freeze-
Out"( which is so upbeat that 
you cannot help but to get up 
and dance) are there. Eight 
songs from Born in the U.S.A. 
may be a bit too many, but the 
live interpretations are much 
more exciting than the 
originally overplayed radio 
versions. The combination of 
opening stories, the lyrics to 
the songs, the music created 
by the E Street Band, and the 
powerful voice tying them all 
together makes LIVE/ 1975~ 
85 the best musical gift anyone 
could get this holiday season. 

Vicious 
Continued from page 2 
and complains about how 
other people are trying to 
contro! Sid's career and how 
they don't realize how great 
Sid actually is. 

Oldman is perfecdy cast as 
Sid Vicious; he uses his body 
and his face to portray Sid's 
inability to control his 
destiny. Sid is trying to live up 
to everything he is supposed 
to be, but once drugs grab 
ahold of him, he has no 
chance at deciding his fate. . 

The movie is directed by 
Alex Cox, the man behind 
Repo Man. Cox does a good 
job in displaying the 
depreSSing feel of the London 
slums of the seventies where 
"punk" grew up. 

Some of the visual images 
are stunning; most notably 
some are quick edits that 
juxtapose the different kinds 
of lifestyles. He gets too 
"artsy" with some scenes, but 
these moments are excusable 
since he deals with such a 
disheartening and gloomy 
subject. 

Movie-goer be forewarned: 
this is not a nice movie. It is a 
very good movie, and one 
worth seeing, but only see it if 
you feel good about yourself; 
this movie is definitely 
depressing.
