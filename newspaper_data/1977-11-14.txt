The display, running through 
Dec. 11, was organized u'rthe 
La Jolla-based Center for 
Photographic Arts. Center 
director Larry Urrutia worked 
closely with Gerry McAllister, 
Mandeville Gallery director, 
and her staff to bring about the 
show. A National Endowment 
for the Arts grant helped 
support the show. 

Asked why he paired the two 
artists, Urrutia explained that 
" both deal with the same

different approaches . One, II

Arbus and A vedon were born

Atomic Cafe sets off 
a 'musical explosion' 

by Alan Russell 

Atomic Cafe. 
In itself, the name is potent 

enough to bring on a space age 
stomach ache, or raise the 
hackles of nuclear opponents. 
The only explosion one needs to 
fear, though, is a musical one. 

Tuesday evening at eight in 
the Mandeville Recital Hall 
Atomic Cafe will perform, in 
what is termed a "special" 
evening, for the third time this 
year. 

So now you ask, what is this 
Atomic Cafe? 

Dennis Woodrich and Law-
rence Czoka, coordinators of 
tomorrow night's perfor-
mance, prefer to label the 
whole affair as "just good 
music." 

A pet project for many music 
graduate students, the Atomic 
Cafe has evolved over the years 
from an evening of basically 
improvisational music to what 
is now a more structured, but 
perhaps diverse, program. 

.. All the music is what we'd 
term new or recent, II said 
Woodrich, "bu.t in all the 
performances there's been a 
little bit of everything." 

The American premier of 
Ligne Interrompue by Jean-
nine Richer will be heard, as 
well as works by ,uest 
composers Peter S. Ode,ard 
from UC Irvine and Robert 
Henin,er from Mesa junior 
collece. UCSD ,rad. students 
John O'Neill and Jack Leulll, 
as well as Woodrich and ClOD, 

will also be performing their 
works. . 

The free concert is a "casual 
one" according to Czoka. "It's 
not the scary and stiff music 
you might picture," he said. 
.. Atomic Cafe started some 
years ago with the idea of salon 
recitals, performing in Revelle 
Cafeteria and the like. The 
same spirit is still around, and 
if you feel like sitting on the 
floor, you're welcome to. II 

As for the future of the 
Atomic Cafe, there will be eight 
more performances this year. 
Woodrich sees continued 
expansion of the program, and 
is hopeful of gaining an inter-
campus exchange program for 
musicians. 

"We've esbblished a reci-
procal performance plan and 
are in the process of contacting 
other performance froups that 
represent ori,ina and new 
music," said Woodrich. 
"Quality is the most important 
thing." 

Becau.se of what Woodrich 
terms "a great deal of interest 
in multi-media productions," 
expansion into other art forms, 
such as drama and art (with 
reciprocal performances) is 
also bein, looked into. 

Scheduled to last an hour and 
a half, both Woodrich and 
ClOD urged all interested to 
"come early and stay late." 

"Let's face it," they both 
echoed, "musicians love 
nothing more than talkin, 
about their pieces." 

Except maybe playing them. 

.Research papers are selling well-
can grades be bought and sold? 

In a random poll of University professors, 
purchased papers seemed to "pass" quite well 
by Laura A. Richter 

News Editor 
In theory, $100 could buy you 

an "A." 
For $3 to $7 a page, one can 

purchase any of the 7,000 
research papers Qn file at a Los 
AngeJes research assistance 
company. If a particular topic 
is not on file , a "specialist" Will 
write the paper for a minimum 
of $6 a page. 

To facilitate matters further, 
both Visa and Master Charge 
are accepted. 

Moral question 
When confronted with the 

moral question of selling such 
materials, an employee of the 
company replied that " it falls 
upon the user of the product -
it's your perogative." 

Donald Wesling, professor of 
literature and chairman of the 
Academic Senate's Committee 
on Subject A and Writing, felt 
that "it is possible to argue that 
the student who buys papers 
does not deserve to be at the 
University. " 

Wesling, who commented 
that "writing is difficult, even 
for those of us who are 
professional word-slingers," 
feels strongly that " this 
practice is totally immoral and 
contradicts the best purpose of 
a community of scholars." 

Among eight professors 
randomly surveyed by the 
Triton Times , only three 
recalled instances in which 

students had been suspected of 
submitting papers that they 
themselves had not written. 

Alain Cohen, professor of 
literature, experienced one 
such incident a few years ago, 
but found his accusation 
impossible to prove. Cohen 
stated, "It's a matteroffeeling. 
You have this kind of intuition 
that cannot be wrong. " 

Confronting the student 
Both Wesling and Stanley 

Chodorow, professor of history, 
handled the situation by testing 
the student on the content of the 
assignment. In each case, the 
student displayed an accurate 
knowledge of the subject 
matter, whereby the instance 
was pursued no further . 
Referring to the stud~nt who 
had been challenged, Chodorow 
said "He made a believer out of 
me." 

It is. 'impossible to obtain 
precise data as to the number of 
students who make use of the 
opportunity to buy papers, but 
UCSD appears to have a 
miniscule percentage of those 
who do. Fred Randall, profes-
sor of literature, had never 
encountered a case and 
persona1lv felt that "a way of 
preventing that problem by 
setting up the assignment 
within the context of the course 
so that someone from the 
research company would have 
a problem writing it." 

Wesling suggests that 

students who purchase pre-
written assignments have 
undergone various forms of 
pressure, either in schola tics 
or in their home lives. That 
pressure is alleviated, some-
what, for UCSD literature 
students, where there is little 
demand to produce research 
papers. Said Wesling, "UCSD 
students do not read a lot of 
literary criticism " and 
assignments usually call for ' 
"first respon es that are set in a 
rational order." 

Evidently, students at UCSD 
are writing their own papers. 
The quality of their work has 
yet to be determined. 

Writing at UCSD is being 
evaluated by the Committee on 
Subject A and Writing, which 
has received $22,000 in funding 
by the Chancellor's Committee 
on Instructional Improvement 
Projects . While having sur-
veyed various approaches to 
testing , evaluation and the 
teaching of writing , the 
Committee is proceeding to 
explore the effectiveness of the 
writing programs at all fO\lr 
colleges. 

Complex undertaking 
It i Wesling's view that 

" s ucce s in writing is not an 
easy thing to define." Explain-
ing the complexities of the 
undertaking, he commented 
that " It is possible to say

Asthma League sponsor$ "Bike for Breath" 
Blke-a-Thon on three college campuses 

by Rosanne Tricoles 
Staff Writer 

If the members of the San Diego Children's 
Asthma League have their way, the UCSD bike 
paths will be crowded with riders this Saturday, 
Nov. 19. All of them will be riding to help finance 
the care and treatment of asthmatic youngsters. 

This "Bike for Breath" is the first major event 
which the local chapter of the Children's 
Asthma League has organized in its one and a 
half years of existence. "We hope to have 1000 
riders, with the proceeds going to people with 
asthma and other breathing problems," said 
Paulette Christianson, vice president of the 
local group and chairperson of the bike-a-thon. 

The bike-a-thon will be held from 9 to 4 
simultaneously at three collele campuses in 
San Die,o, includinl UCSD. The business sector 
of the communitY'is helpiq sponsor the event: 
Jack-jn-the-Box Restaurants will provide free 
food COUPOOi and KCBQ radio personaUties 
Charlie and Harrigan are the honorary 
chairmen. 

Anyone may participate in the bike-a-thon. 
The UCSD bike route is five and a balf miles 
long, but there is no limit to the number of miles 
a person may ride. However, to qualify, each 
biker must have a minimum sponsorship of 25 
cents per mile. 

Various age categories have been devised, 
and prizes will be awarded to those bikes who 
raise the most money in each of the categories. 

With the money raised in the bike-a-thon, the 
Children'S Asthma League finances the work of 
the National Asthma Center Hospital in Denver. 
The hospital, the only one of its kind in the 
United States, treats asthmatic children free of 
charge. One hundred and fifty children, ranging 
in age from four to 16 c~n be treated at the same 
time, at no cost to their Il8rents. 

Currently, there is no ,!ure for asthma, only 
treatments . It costs the Notional Asthma Center 
$21,500 a year to care for one child. Therefore, 
the Children'lI AstItm U:l1U ed effort 
of everyone, including members of the UCSD 
community, to help alleviate the suffering 
caused by asthma, and to eventually find a cure 
for it.

most part, ,ood; the WomeD 
are, for the molt part, not 80 
good. 

Ricardo Domin,uez, in a 
distinctly excellent perfor· 
mance, discoven the full raDle 
of the hero's (Eddie Carranza) 
emotional bestiality and 
buman sensitivity. We are 
shown ' a man ravaged by a 
pasaion that is at the same time 
grossly abnormal and extrem· 
ely tender, a passion tbat 
becomes almost sacred In his 
devotion to it. As the lumber-
101, inarticulate longshore· 
man, Dominguez is like a brute 
animal in whose eyes can be 
noted an emotion that tran-
scends the body and even the 
mind. Eddie's passion is for his 
youn, niece, Catherine, and 
this IS obviously goiq to des-
troy him in the end, although 
Eddie doesn't know this and he 
won't know it. Only his 
wife Beatrice recognizes ' the 
double implication of incest and 
adultery In Eddie's passion, but 
unfortunately, Sylvia Corte~ 
though she portrays the 
cbaracter realistically as far as 
appearances go, puts out too 
much energy and winds up with 
little in the way of understand-
ing the complexities of 
Beatrice's inner motivations 
and her overt emotional 
reactions to Eddie's eschewal 
of her in favor of their niece. 

Likewise, too much acting by 
Wendy Small reduces Cather-
ine to a mere blubbering baby, 
the blubbering being more like 
choking on a chicken bone. The 
power of believability in 
Dominguez creates with only 
his searing eyes is severely 
'endangered by Cortez's and 
Small 's fussbudgety need to 
deonstrate emotion. Whoever 
told actors tbat they should 
never do nothing on stage , 
should be shot. Beatrice, and 
especially Catherine, bave a 
good many moments where 
doing nothing would be 
immensely more moving than 
going into convulsions or 
exploding into a tizzy . In this 
way, Cortez and Small pull the

trageCly beyond the point Miller 
meant lor it to go: "Eddie is 
stiU not a man to weep over; the 
play does not attempt to swamp 
the audience in tears." 

Fine performances are also 
given by Gregorio Flores, as 
Marcos, and Gordon Preston, 
as Rodolfo, the two "mojados" 
that Eddie eventually betrays 
to the immigration authorities. 
Flores , who was taut and 
repetitive in California 
Pacific's "Steambath" in this 
production comes across with a 
great deal of sensitivity 
augmented by a perfectly 
controlled touch of dramatic 
and comic innuendo. Preston's 
mastery of the Chicano dialect, 
his exquisite comic timing and 
devastating good looks add up 
to a superb Rodolfo. As a pair, 
Preston and Flores are great. 

Jose Garcia, as Alvarez, 
Eddie's attorney, gi ves a mixed 
performance. The character 
Alvarez acts as a modern 
Greek chorus, dividing the play 
into episodes and punctuating 
them with commentary. 
Garcia , it seems , took the 
Greek idea a bit too seriously, 
and stagily characterizes 
Alvarez as an austere and 
eloquent sage. His perfor-

mance Is intense - almost 
stunning - but the cbaracter is 
all wrong. 

The set (deaiped by James 
Sims) and use of stage space, 
are, as usual for the UCSD 
drama department, brilliant. If 
you've ever driven on l-S past 
the Coronado Bridge (this is 
where the bridge part comes 
in) , and really noticed it, the 
monolithic set pieces would be 
immediately recognizable, 
right down to the grafltti -
"Varno, Si - Yonkee, No." 

The attempt for verisimili-
tude to the San Diego scene in 
Huerta's Chicanization of "A 
View From the Bridge" is at 
once appealing and disturbing. 
There is something about 
seeing a production set in your 
own exact milieu that takes 
some getting used to - it's a 
little too' too. Logan Heights, 
Union Street, the Coronado 
Bridge - can this really be 
happening here? The answer is 
yes, and the choice to San 
Diegoize as well as Chicanize is 
good. We are confronted by the 
realities of our own environ-
ment in the most intimate way, 
and once we can accept this the 
play becomes thrillingly 
immediate.

CPT's new bill of fare 
not theatre's best choice 

"Slow Dance on the Killing Ground" is a whole lot better than 
California Pacific Theatre's last production, "Steambatb." If you 
saw "Steambath" and vowed never to go back you might want to 
reconsider - CPT bas grown up a little since then. 

This is not 'to say that "Slow Dance" is really exceptional 
theatre, but for SaD Diego, for the Puppet Theatre in Balboa Park 
and for the financial problems that beset all adolescent theatres 
like CPT In the city, U's not at all bad. (For the $3.75 ticket price, 
however, I'd like to see a little more nash and savvy.) 

"Slow Dance on the Killing Ground" (also produced at UCSD 
last year by the drama department) is a djfficult play, because it is 
dated in the most unfortunate way. Uke' 'Steambath 'it deals with 
issues aDd incidents of the 60s, incidents that are too removed from 
us to bave any direct meaning, and issues that are so close that our 
retrospective vision is blurred by the very nearness. Indeed, the 
play is a compendium of by-gone issues and controversies, most of 
them severely hackneyed as well. On1y death really makes it as a 
relevant and refreshing topic, nicely overshadowing everything 
but the insurmountable, in this case the pro-life issue. 

"Slow Dance" explores death as a means to exorcize guilt, but 
the message becomes confused as it applies to Rosie, a Jewish 
graduate student from the Bronx seeking an illegal abortion in 
Brooklyn. For her, the avowal of life is supposedlY1loing to save 
her from the guilt of a death on her bands if she goes ahead and has 
the abortion. It's with this abortion business that the play really 
runs up against the 70s.

The other two characters, Mr. Glas and the black dracula-like L.-__ ~ _ _____ --' 
Randall reaUy have committed crimes and Ut~y themselves 
require punishment or death. This I caD buy - it's a univel'S31 
theme. Rosie's illegal abortion isn't. But the overt model for this 
punishment motif is the hanging of Adolph Eichman in the 60s, who 
was, supposedly, relieved to be punished for his crimes. But who 
the hell was Adolph Eichman? I guess I didn't listen to Huntley and 
Brinkley enough back then . (I was flve years old back then.) 

Ron Covington, who plays Randall, the one who ,has it all figured 
out and can quote Gide, Baude\lilre and Kafka among others, is 
tremendous in his role. For an 18 year old, his mastery of a 
staggering amount of dialogue and his ability to talk jive one 
moment and Uke death incarnate the next is stupefying. Kandis 
Chappell, similarly is electrifying as the plain Jewish graduate 
student, and that's not an easy thing to pull off - to be plain and 
electrifyiq at the same time. Mack Owen slips up in comparison 
to these two, though he is a very sensitive perfonner. His off and on 
Brooklynese and lack of focus are the main causes of his out of 
kilter performance. 
- Sets by John Newhouse are a higb-schoolish mixture of realism, 
naturalism and over-trivialized detail. The worst part is the bright 
yellow fire hydrant that appears to be waiting right outside the 
door of Glas' sundry store. 

The hydrant, I suppose, is , 
meaot to suggest the streeta of 
Brooklyn. Actually it suggests 
a fire hydrant in a doorway . 

In ai, "Slow Dance on the 
Killing Ground," not so badly 
directed by Kendall Harris, is a 
poor choice for a theatre like 
CPT, or for that matter, any 
theatre . It needs a decade or 
two to knock off the rough edges 
of youth before it will wear well 
on audiences, no matter how 
well performed.

You enjoy keeping fit. It's 

. good fun and good sense. You 
don't let your period stop you, 
either. Because you use Tampax 
tampons. 

Since they're worn internall~ 
you don't worry about chafing 
or bulges. They're easy to use, 
too. (All the instructions you 
need are right in the package. ) 
But, most illlp()rlm, Tampax 
tampons are uniquely designed 
to expand 10 they conform to 
individual body contpurs. Which 
means there's far less chance 
of an accident. 

No wonder you'd never con, 
sider any other form of feminine 
protection. And no wonder 
you're in such wonderful shape.

enlarged and revealed. The 
dissonance can be harsh. 

Of the portraits in the exhibit, 
Avedon remarked, "I chose to 
photograpb all the people for 
very subjective reaso.ns . 
There's a connection between 
those people and the way I've 
manipulated them to express 
myself. No one," he added, 
"bas ever liked his picture." 

Avedon, the portraitist, has 
long been a glamour photo-
graphy innovator. Working 
freelance, and for Harpers 
Bazaar and Vogue magazmes, 
Avedon, according to Current 
Biography, is " credited with 
e levating fashion photo-
graphy to the level oC an art 
Conn ." But Avedon has said, 
" fashion is where I make my 
living. I consider myself a 
portrait photographer." In that 
endeavor, writes Owen Ed-
wards in Playboy, "he is 
nothing less than a collector of 
souls."

Pepperdine guns 
down UCSD, 22-13 
In all sports, there are good teams and there are excellent 

teams. Members of the former category win a majority of their 
games, playing a few tough teams during the sea$On, while schools 
in the latter group win most of their games against a demanding 
schedule. UCSD, one of the good teams, took on fourth ranked 
Pepperdine Waves,. one of the excellent teams, Saturday 
afternoon and found out just what the caliber of an excellent team is. . 

The Waves used an awesome offensive attack to hand the 
Tritons their seventh loss of the season, 22-13 in the Natatorium. 

Before the game, Triton coach Russ Hafferkamp said his squad 
would have to play error-free waterpolo to beat the Waves, ho had 
tuned up by blasting San Diego State 15-5 earlier in the day. UCSD 
played valiantly, trying to penetrate Pepperdine's tough defense, 
but fp.1I prey to a barrage of slick passes and fancy shooting. 

Prior to the game, Hafferkamp told the TrilOn Times there 
would be no small college championships this year and UCSD 
probably would not receive a bid to the NCAA playoffs because 
"our schedule isn't competitive enough," UCSD will then, most 
likely, close out its 1977 campaign with the UC Riverside 
Invitational this Friday and Saturday. Last Friday afternoon, the 
Tritons easily defeated host UCR, 11-7, as Hafferkamp alternated 
his first and second teams "randomly.
