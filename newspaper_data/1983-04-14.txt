Interview 

Balancing the Books Parking Tickets: 
With Rerm Johnson 

By MIKE GREEN BE RG 
Where Has All the Money Gone? 

Staff Writer 
accounting, the entire Herm D. Johnson has spent 

35 years working for the 
Ullil1ersity of California, the 
lasl nineteen as l'ice chancellor 
of business and finance at 
UeSD. Johnson graduated 
from UC Berkeley in 1948, and 
became a junior accountant 
there be/ore being called back 
into the military to serve in the 
Korean war. A/ter the war, he 
returned to Berkeley, eventually 
coming down to UCSD (the~l 
Scripps Institute of Technology) 
in 1955 to seY/'1' as head oj 
Business and Fillance. 
Gu ardia n : Twenty eight 
years ago, when you arrived at 
Scripps, what was your 
operating budget? 

material handling purchasing -l.--... ...... 

Johnson: 4.5 million. 
Guardian: What is it now? 
John son : In it elf, Scripps 
is approaching 50 million 
dollars , while the campu as a 
whole is approaching 400 
million dollars. The hospital is 
$90 million dollars, cripps 
Institution $50 million, the 
medical chool is another $50 
million, (and) auxiliary 
enterprises $20 million. 
Guardian: What is "auxili· 
ary enterprises"? 
J ohnson: (Get out annual 
report) This is the annual 
report from last year, and this 
breaks it out in the various 
elements, both in the stacked 
income ($397 million) and in 
expenditures ($380 million). 
Guardian: What does the 
school do with the $17 million 
profit? 
J ohnson: r don't think it i a 
question of making or 
breaking, afterall it is a non· 
profit institution , 
Gua rdia n:Where does the 17 
mi ll ion go? 
Johnson : Income is merely 
receipt s and revenues, not 
income in the industrial sense, 
So I think you can't equate 
that: income may be reported 
equal to expenditures ... there 
is no profit. (laughing) As a 
mat ter of fact, r was just 
talking with a group on a loss. 
and now we ha\e to work out 
of it. 
Guard ian: What is auxili· 
ary enterprises? 
J ohnson : Auxiliary enter-
orises is an area that would 
include housing, food service, 
bookstore, parking operations: 
in other words. those activities 
that depend on revenues or 
income from paid in to the 
appropriation, for those areas, 
So that is the definition of 
auxiliary enterprises. Service 
enterpri es is comprised of 
things like the storehouse, 
photographics and those who 
provide services on a recharge 
baSIS to the university 
departments as opposed to the 
auxiliary enterprises. 

0, you have the personnel 
operation, in addition to the 

function of the university. You 
have the facilities; manage· 
ment, plant service, operation 
in the police, busines 
services, a nd com pu ter 
operations that basically are 
the areas that I'm responsible 
for. 
Guardian: How will Gover· 
nor Deukmejian's budget 
affect UCSD in the coming 
year? 
Johnson: The San Diego 
campus, as far as I understand 
it, is faring pretty well. UCSD 
is get ting another 17 faculty 
members; I think that has a 
very positive impact. 
Guardian: Do you think the 
recent budget will make 
students more dependent on 
grants? 
Johnson: There again, I 
haven't analyzed that yet. 
Guardian: Research grants. 
What percentage of the 
, choot's funds come from 
them? 
Johnson: Expenditure·wise. 
28.9 percent of the total 
budget. Research was up $109 
million dollars last year. 
Gua rdian: Are we depen· 
dent on th m? 
Johnson: That is a difficult 
question to answer. We do a 
great deal of federal resea rch ; 
we have a great talented 
faculty, and their ability to 
obtain the research funding is 
quite good: we are in the top 
ten or higher nationally. That 
peak well about that 

faculty's ability, but I can't 
relate that to dependency. I 
would say to the extent that 
we do research that our 
facility depends upon federal 
grants, but that's peer 
competition; it just speaks for 
the excellence of the staff . 
Guardian: One of the areas 
that you are responsihle for is 
the campus police. Concerning 
parking tickets, didn't a bill 
recently pass that stipulated 
that the money generated from 
parking tickets will no longer 
be split 50·50 between the city 
and UeSD, but a majority of 
the income will go to the 
campus instead? 
Joh nson: Under an agree· 
ment with the courts. the 
university rather than the city 
will be collecting funds 
concerning parking tickets. It 
used to be split 50·50 with the 
city. with our money going 
into the parking alternative 
program. Now. a greater 
percentage WIll go Into our 
parking alternative program 
(since LICSD will be getting a 
majority of the generated 
income). 
Guard ia n: What are those 
parking alternatives? More 
parking spaces?

Exploring the Fate 
of San Diego's Sewage 

Does San Diego ha ve 
adequate sewage treatment 
capacity to accommodate future 
growth? Does new development 
pay its fair sha re of sewer costs? 
These two ques t io"s are 
addressed i" a two-part report 
written by students in the 
Urban Studies and Planning 
Program (USP) for the Sierra 
Club. 
The Metro System 

The waste water San 
Diegans flush down their 
drain and toilets is collected 
in pipes and pumped to the 
Metropolitan Sewage Treat· 
ment Facility (Metro) located 
at Point Loma. Here it is 
treated to remove particulates. 
The resulting sludge is piped 
to Fiesta Island to dry out, and 
the effluent is discharged into 
the Pacific Ocean. In 1982, an 
average of 135 million gallons 
of sewage were treated daily at 
the Point Loma facility from 
the City of San Diego, a 
number of surrounding 
communities and Tijuana. 
This was up from 100 million 
gallons per day (mg/d) in 1974 
and from 85 mg/d in 1969. 

The rapid increase in the 
amount of sewage generated 
by San Diego hou eholds and 
bu iness has raised concern 
about whether Metro will be 
able to meet growing future 
sewage needs. Since 1978, 
Metro has been exceeding its 
official rated capacity of 120 
mg/ d. Sewage flows are 
expected to rise even more a 
the San Diego area continues 
to grow to a projected 2.6 
million inhabitants bytheyear 
2000. 

The other pressing question 
concerns the cost to provide 
sewer service to new su burban 
development such as North 
City West or Otay Mesa. This 
mcludes the cost ot extending 
sewer lines to outlying areas, 
the cost of pumping the 
sewage to Point Loma and the 
cost of treating the additional 
ewage generated by suburban 

development. 

Findings of the Report 
Last Thursday, a group of 

seven students from the 
Urban Studies and Planning 
Program reported the findings 
from their study of these 
issues to members of the San 
Diego Sierra Club at their 
headquarters in Balboa Park. 

The 40'page study con-
cludes that Metro has 
sufficient treatment capacity 
to accommodate futuregrowth 
in San Diego through the year 
2000, assuming that other 
treatment facilities are found 
for Tijuana, However, if Metro 
continues to treat Tijuana 
sewage, then serious capacity 
problems could result within 
the next 15 years. The report 
also concludes that developers 
and new home buyers 
generally pay the cost of 
providing sewer service to new 
development through hook-up 
fees and monthly use charges. 

These findings are based on 
interviews with officials at 
Metro and other government 
agencies concerned with 
waste water and with local 
developers. The report also 
makes its own projections of 
the amount of sewage that will 
be generated in 1985, 1990, 
1995, and 2000. 
The Capacity Question 

Currently, San Diego 
generates an average of 100 
gallons of waste water per 
person each day. At this rate, 
the total sewage flow from the 
City of San Diego and other 
communities in the county 
served by Metro will amount 
to 169 million gallons per day 
by the year 2000. Thi is a 25 
percent increase over present 
levels and exceeds the official 
rated capacity by nearly 50 
million gallons per day, 

Based on interviews with 
Metro officials, the report 
concludes that the system is 
capable of meeting future 
needs. Built In 1963, the Point 
Lorna treatment plant was 
designed to accomodate an

Letters to the Editor 

Jewish Student Strikes Zionism Letter 
Editor: 

[ am writing in response to 
the letter ("Zionism, 
Imperialism Threaten World 
Peace," April 7). Ordinarily I 
wou Id not respond to an 
editorial which by its own 
illiteracy and inaccuracy 
clearly discounts its credibili-
ty. [n this case, however, I am 
compelled to write because of 
two things that disturbed me 
when I read the letter. 

As far as the letter goes, two 
main points warrant criticism. 
Among the article's finest 
moments was "The Zionist 
state first recognized by the 
USSR among its numerous 
deleterious acts has changed a 
land of passion into a land of 
scorn, etc." where the author 
apparently is trying to link 
Zionism and communism. 

This claim probably arises 
because the USSR supported 
Israel in its early years; 
however, only someone who is 
blind and completely ignorant 
to politics from 1967 till the 
present would not know that 
the Soviet Union, like the 
entire Third World, has openly 
condemned all of Israel' s 
political actions. Israel is a 
true ally of the United States, 
unlike the Soviet·trained and 
communist·backed PLO, who 
try to represent the Palestin· 
ian 's noble cause but are 
worthy of condemnation for 
their repressive. terrorist 
activities. 

The second thing that 
disturbed me about the letter 
was the misrepresentation of 
facts about Zionism . The 
author completely wrenched 
Theodore Herz)'s statements 

from context, as Herzl was a 
very strong supporter of world 
peace. Also, the UN resolu· 
tions, chosen and explained as 
they were, were misleading. 
As in Congress, riders are 
often 'tacked on' to UN 
resolutions, condemning 
certain countries, usually 
Israel and the United States-
but occasionally others. In the 
cases listed, there were riders 
on the re olutions which were 
against Israel or her allies, and 
o Israel voted "No," 

In light of all these 
inaccuracies. the letter of 
editorial was nothing more 
than the emotional outcry of a 
misinformed person . I hope we 
can all learn something from 
this cry of hate.

CALPIRG Takes Initiative, Deserves Vote 
Editor: 

Since the mid·seventies, 
there has been a steady decl ine 
in st udent activism with 
respect to broad social issues. 
High un employment in 
conjunction with financial aid 
cuts have prompted college 
student s take on much more 
practical and self-centered 
lifestyles, Although aware-
ness of the nuclear arms race 
has reached unparalleled 
levels among Americans, one 
finds few signs of student 
interest. discus s ion , or 
agitation over this topic on the 
UCSD campus. 

Nevertheless, there is still 
one vehicle left at thiS school 
for helping and encouraging 
students to have an impact on 
community and national 
affairs: CaIPIRG. This student 
organization has taken great 
initiative on environmental 
and consumer issues. Due to 

the motivation and energy of 
the students who run it. 
CalPIRG has had remarkable 
s u ccess at influencing 
government decisions. For 

example, It was the major 
proponent behind a piece of 
legislation recently passed by 
the San Diego City Council

more romantic, one might get 
the urge to embrace omeone

milttant. to tear the horrible 
little amplifiers from their 
sickbeds. This noisegoe on all

so drained of their lifeblood 
that no one can object to them 

One hundred and fifteen 
years ago, excu e me. five 
score and fifteen years ago, 
the California State 
Legislature brought fort h 
upon this continent what 
would become the world's 
greates land·grant college 
sYstem. One of the reasons 
the measure passed was 
the implIcit idea that the 
graduates of the PC 
system would, by their 
fruitfulness in pursuits 
closed to them without a 
college education. benefit 

the whole State of 
CalIfornia In excess of the 
tax funds spent on the 
University. 

The current Governor of 
the State of California has 
seen fit to ask the students 
to pay more for their 
education, so that he can 
sa\'e money to spend on 
other things. Not that 
roads are not nIce to have, 
but how many engineers 
and deSigners for Cal·

Dishonesty 
By BILL HESS 

'>taff Wroler 

By s heer des i&,n , UCSD 
s hould be a cheater s paradise. 
It has packed classrooms and 
lecture halls, di fficu It classes, 
and an ambitious student 
body. However, chea ting is one 
of the leas t talked ·about is ues 
on this campus. 

In light of this, the question 
in this week's Campus Forum 
is, " Is academic cheating a 
problem at UCSU ?" 
HENRY CHU, SENIOR 
BIOLOGY MAJOR 

Chu, current president of 
the Associated Students, says 
that "massive amount s of 
<;ubvers ive cheating" don 't 
:>ccur at UCSD, and that he 
feels the amount of cheating 
here "is the same as at any 
ot her school." 

perceive it in different ways. 
urveys conducled by the 

CEP, Groves said , ha\'e shown 
that mosl faculty members 
don't feel cheating is a serious 
problem, while most s tud ents 
do. In order to alleviate the 
problem, Groves says thaI 
instructors must realize that 
cheating does occur, s tudent s 
must police them elves, and 
the administration mu s t 
improve the crowded class-
room s ituation. 

"The administration has 
the res ponsibility to provide 
the right environment for fair 
lea rning within the co n· 
straints of what they're able to 
do," he said. "After that. it's a 
mutual respons lbtlity between 
the s tudents and the faculty." 

"I ca n think of one or two 
cases offhand of a professor 
accusing a ·tudent of cheating, 
but (such cases) are very rare. 
Cheating i s n 't a bi~ 
contro\'ers ial issue at UCSD, ' 
said Chu. 

As for the s tud ent s, Groves 
said th eir responsibi lity is on 
the individual leve l. 

Patrons of \VaJk' s Place havc Hn opportunity thi ... week to subject them..,el\,e.., to a 
breathalyzer te!>t during lunch hour. Thi<; unidentified ... tudent ga\ e a blo" and found, to hi., 

"We don 't have an honor 
system here where students 
are obliged to monitor their 
fellow students and report 
Vio latIOns," said Gro\es . 
GI\ en that, he added, studcnti' 
are "pm ately responsible" for 
their own Integrity. 

surprise, that he wa., totally ... ober. 

To alle\'iate any cheating 
problems that might exist, 
Chu recommends the elimina· 
tion of overcrowded classes. 

"Right no\~, the leclure 
halls are reall} crowded, so 
people ha\e to Sit right next to 
each other. Natura lly, that's 
gomg to provoke cheating," he 
.,aid, adding that mul! iple 
cholct' lesl s il1\tle rheat ing. 

"I t hll1k pmfl'ssors ha\e to 
t' t' a II I. e \\ hen c h eat I n g 
"nuatil)ns exist, and then do 
their hest toeltminate them bv 
using bigger rooms for tesl ing, 
and hm'ing essay·lype tests, or 
at least sl'\eral \ersions of the 
same exam." he said. " I'm a 
bIOlogy major, and in most of 
tht' tei't:-;, the professor"; do 
the'ie things, so the tests turn 
out pretty fair," he added.

SDSU's Unique Rehabilitation Program 

Francc<; Olds en 

By WENDY PAULSON 
Siaff W riler 

San Diego State University 
is offering a unique program 
designed to bring recovering 
alcoholics, drug addicts and 
ex·convicts together with 
professional counselors who 
have s hared s imilar life 
experiences. SPAN (Special 
Project for Alcohol and 
Narcot ics) was not designed to 
be a rehabilita tion program per 
se. In s tead , it offer s a 
combination of class and field 
work to those who have been 
inca rce rated , as we ll as 
recovered ad d icts a nd 
a lcoh o li cs. lea d ing to a 
cert ificate in Human Services. 

Found ed in 1977, SPAN is 
the bra inchi ld of Frances 
Oldsen , who hoped that t he 
combination of university· 
level s tud y, coun seli n g 
intern ships, and life experi· 
ence will enable graduates to 
sen'e more effecti\'el y than the 
typical college grad . 

Origi nally. SPAN used the 
facilitie and finances of JOVE 
Inc .. a service that helps those 
who ha ve co m e out of 
incarce rati on find employ· 
ment. Due to the extensive 
budget cuts experienced by 
commun ity agencies, SPAN 
was forced to leave JOVE, and 
wi th the s upp o rt a n d 
donation s of several SPAN 
graduates they have opened a n 
office in Normal Heights on 
Adam Ave. and Felton St. . 
sharing space with a Vietnam 
Veterans agency. 

The curricu lum for SPAN 
requires 15 units of socia l 
service classes at SDSU. a n 
intern s hip in a fie ld of 
rehabilitation. and the student 
mus t be a re habihtated 
alcoholic or drug addict with at 
least a year of sobriety, or ha ve

EVELYN WOOD READING DYNAMICS 



Michael Been has heard it all before. The 
stories of how his band, The Call. is 
consistently thought of as a British group, 
when it iS,in fact. from California. "It is 
really silly, they (Polygram Records) wanted 
to play it up from a marketing level. It is 
now very vogue and hip to be British,just as 
it was in '64. 

"We are not a California band in a musical 
sense. I don't like the Eagles or Buffalo 
Springfield and I never listen to surf music. 
We have to live somewhere, and it just 
happens to be California." 

If they are not from here or there, where 
are they from, and why are The Call rising up 
the charts and gaining critical recognition 
wherever they go? 

• • • 

It was 25 years ago thata young Been was 
living in the Mid-West and listening to rock 
and roll records. " When I was four years old I 
flipped out over Elvis, Growing up in 
Oklahoma, music is very important. There is 
no beach, no culture and you don't get a lot 
of the movies out there," 

He decided, or better yet. knew music was 
what he would do. He left Oklahoma and 
went to college in Chicago. Thinking like 
most aspiring musicians, Been figured to 
make it in the business, California was the 
place to be. When he came to Los Angeles he 
met keyboardist Steve Huddleston who by 
coincidence was also from Oklahoma. For 
economic reasons they lived in a suburb of 
LA. called Torrance, (Been claims it is 
"Where all the smog in L.A. comes from.") 

"This was in 1974-75 and the music 
business was such that to make it you had to 
be a session player or a lounge singer 
playing top 40." looking for fresh air and a 
fresh music scene, the duo headed north. 
"We moved to Santa Cruz, but we really 
wanted to go to San francisco, but couldn·t 
afford it. Up there you could play original 
music and they appreciated it. there wasn't 
any phony lounge scene." 

Been and Huddleston formed a band and 
began sending demo tapes to the record 
companies and received Interest. The group

stardom amidst

industry 

By ANDRt:W Kft:IER 

signed a two-album contract with Polygram 
and also got a name change. " We were 
originally called Motion Pictures, but the 
legal department found out there was 
another band called Moving Pictures, so we 
had to come up with something and we 
decided on "The Call. " 

Their first album.appropriately titled The 
Call. did not receive much commercial 
attention but was picked up on independent 
and college radio stations and garnished 
favorable reviews. 

If the American public was not ready for 
the band, the English audience was, as Been 
explains."Even before our album came out 
we toured In Brltian and they really liked us. 
We had listened to bands like the Sex Pistols 
and the Clash and In 1977 America was not 
receptive to that music. We had bands like 
REO and Journey that have no connection to 
any musical tradition. They (American 
bands) had abandoned their roots and it 
seemed the English had more awareness of 

what was going on," 
The Call had to wait it out in the states 

while the musical tides changed, The band 
had another album left on their contract and 
Been was surprised the record company was 
not pressuring them to make a more 
commercially oriented record,"They left it 
up to us, we were going to sink or swim." 

They recorded that album, Modem 
Romans, last summer and it has a more 
commercial sound and features a strong 
beat (or as the bio says a " more danceable 
sound"), There was mutual consent between 
the band and the record company that 
" When the Walls Came Down" would be 
released as a single. The song has been 
added on many FM playiists and has even 
crept onto the AM dial. 

A self-described movie fanatic , Been was 
excited and surprised with the prospect of 
doing a video for the album. "We did the 
album in July or August, and didn't make 
the video until January, When the song 
started gdting airplay they said , 
'Quick,quick make a video,' It was a great 
experience, it was wonderful to work with 
such professional people and it was fun," 

The "Walls" video has been picked up on 
Music Television (MlV) and has given the 
band instant recognition. The band recently 
sold-out the Country Club in LA. and is 
ready to embark on their first national tour. 

• • • 

It is early afternoon and Been has just 
woken up. Sleep is still in his voice as he 
extends his greetings over the phone from 
Northern California where The Call will start 
their tour as the opening act for the Simple 
Minds, a popular Scottish band. (The tour 
makes a stop at UCSD Monday night for a 
concert in the Gym). 

"We are biting at the bit. waiting to get on 
the road. Last year we didn't have radio 
response to support the amount of touring 
we wanted to do . I really like Simple Minds 
and look forward to playing with them. "

Watson and 
lindberg in 
UCSD show 

Tonight pianist/composer 
[ric Watson and basslst/ 
composer John Undberg will 
perform compositions and 
Improvisations. They formed 
their duo to make an In~epth 
exploration of all the musical 
possibilities open to the plano-
bass instrumentation and to 
make an effort to extend the 
already rich tradition of this 
well known combination. 

As a result. their repertoire, 
which contains compostions 
both by Watson and Undberg, is 
a marked depature from the 
·traditional' piano-bass duo as 
they stress the importance of 
two equal voices, not one being 
accompanist for the other. Their 
music acknowledges and 
respects the entire history ofthe 
music, while at the same time 
trying to achieve another level 
with their own creative ideas. 

Watson is from Connecticut 
and is a graduate of the Oberlin 
Conservatory of Music. He 
currently lives in Paris where he 
is busy with several musical 
projects. He concertizes 
extp.nsively in the solo and trio 
contexts in addition to this duo. 
His trios have included 
drummers Paul Motian and 
Daniel Humair, and bassists Ed 
Schuller and J.f. Jenny Clark: 
Watson is also a npte worthy 
composer of film music and is 
known for his interpretations of 
the solo piano works of 
Scriabin, Berg, and Ives. He has 
recorded two albums for OWL 
records. 

This event will take place in 
Mandeville 5-210 at 8 pm and is 
free to the public.

Painting. Mai Mai Sze wrote, "In 
Chinese painting and 
calligraphy, the primary focus 
was on the realm of Spirit which 
is well known to be elusive and 
almost impossible to put into 
words. Therefore the brush 
work, common to both writing 
and painting became the direct 
means of expression. The 
quality of the brushwork 
represents the inner rhythm and 
harmony of the "Yang" 
(creative) line and the "Yin" 
(receptive) paper." 

The Chinese art tradition 
requires that the beginning 
artist first master calligraphy 
before attempting painting or 
pictoral representations. Within 
the philosophy of Tao, the Way, 
each character or ideograph 
comes to be a symbol of natural 
order. 

Unknowingly, local artist 
Lusana Troxell entered painting 
in a way traditionally Chinese -
by first mastering calligrapy. 
Her show, "Verses of Ught: A 
Mystic Interpretation," is 
presently on display at UCSD's 
Grove Gallery. Her art combines 
calligraphy, both oriental and 
western, gilded surfaces, gold 
and silver inks, watercolor, and 
writings from the f Ching and 
The Way of Tao. 

Troxell attended UCSD for two 
years and completed her degree 
at UC Santa Cruz, studying with 
Donald Jackson, the Queen's 
Royal Scribe. When asked why 
she gravitated toward Chinese 
art, she answered, "I never could 
'do art' in school when I was 

forever being asked to draw 
(and usually in the coldest 
basement in the college) 
inanimate spiritless objects like 
bicycle spokes or broken clay 
pots. These were the objetsd'art 
in Drawing lA and I always 
failed. 

"It was not until I found the 
'Ch'i ' in an object - the 
essence, the spirit. that I was 
able to draw perfectly. To do this 
requires an emptying of oneself. 
a surrendering. The stroke, 
rather than deliberate or 
measured, is largely felt energy. 
The only time I use my mind in 
the actual execution of work is 
in the organization or layout of 
the piece." 

What is especially striking 
about the works on display is 
the use of light. By mixing inks 
with pastels, a certain depth and 
luminescence is achieved, The 
peculiar quality of the colors 
and the metallic inks are 
momentarily seen as looking 
becomes feeling. 

" What I have sought do," said 
Troxell. " is to do more than 
bring about superficial 
pleasure. The works are an 
invitation of consideration. My 
aim is a true expression of Ch 'j 
or that essence of painting and 
calligraphy. 

"The I Ching I chose to use for 
the body or content of the work 
turned out to embody the same 
principles of The Way of 
Chinese Painting. As stated by 
Mai Mai Sze, " Nothing could be 
a better antidote to the 
enervating poisons which have 
debilitated modern painting,"

UCSD's underwater concert Concert Line 
Lene Lovitch tonight The Festival of the New Arts 

will present the world premiere 
of french composer Michel 
Redolfi 's new version of his 
successful underwater music 
concerts Sonic Waters at the 
UCSD Natatorium (swimming 
pool) on Sunday. 
The new edition, entitled Sonic 
Waters /I provides an unique 
experience for the audience to 
hear the concert as they are 
immersed in the 90 degree 
temperature of the swimming 
pool. The sound is heard 
through the water itself in direct 
contact with the swimmer. 
Sonic Waters /I carries the 
drifting listener throu~h seven 

different underwater sound-
scapes. These soundscapes 
move from the sythetic smooth 
waves of a Synclavier 
synthesizer to ajoumey into the 
biological sounds of the marine 
deep. flute and harp sounds 
glitter through the water 
creating an impressionist 
reflection of the world left 
behind in the air. The sounds 
have been created by studio and 
computer processings. 

Michel Redolfi has focussed 
his work on the development of 
underwa ter concerts. These 
began in 1981 in La Jolla Cove, 
He has enjoyed successful

8y JOHN Nf[ 
In the music industry, the 

idea of a female artist is often 
viewed as the chance to sell 
records under the premise that 
they are cute or sultry rather 
tl]an on artistic talent. To a 
certain extent. this trend is 
justified, 

Before Pat Benatar began to 
paint on herjeansand gyrate her 
hips. people. would not listen. 
The Missing Persons EP did not 
make any mark on the market 
until Dale Bozzio appeared 
scantily clad on the cover. The 
Go-Gos are just cute. The 
danger, however , with 
prostituting oneself is that 
people still do not listen, they 
merely watch. 

Undeniably. rock and roll is 
very sexual. As Saira Lee says on 
Robert fripps album The 
League of Gentlemen. "Rock 
music is about fucking." There 

is a certain freedom that 
musicians enjoy that is admired 
by teen America. This attitude 
will always be present where 
there is such a mass market but 
the music that will endure is the 
music conceived for the sake of 
music, not success. Lene Lovich 
belongs to a small group of 
vocalists that brings about a 
personal artistic concept 
without prostituting herself to 
be heard. 

Tops in Pops 

Lene Lovich has just come 
into vogue in San Diego due to 
airplay given to her album No 
Man 's Land. In the past when an 
experimental vocalist would 
come to San Diego {most 
notably last year's Meredith 
Monk performance L the 
appearance would come and go 
unnoticed. Now with a certain 
amount of popularity built up 
for Lovich, there is the chance 
that the typical pop fare will be 
offset by artistry Lovich will 
play tOnight. at the Adams 
Avenue Theater.

Tracing The Call to UCSD 
continued from page 1 
and bassist Greg freeman) also 
are excited about playing in 
front of audiences that are 
familiar with the group's 
material. "When you play at a 
club you're among friends, if 
someone pays eight dollars to 
see us he usually doesn't hate 
us." 

Been also recounts some 
highs and lows of their last trek 
on the road performing on the 
same bill with Ian Hunter, Pete 
Shelley and the Split Enz. " It 
was good playing with the Split 
Enz because we attract similar 
crowds and the people liked us. 
One time we played before Joan 
Jett and there were kids with 
leather jackets who chanted 
'Joan Jett, Joan Jett' during our 
set." 

The crowds are not the only 
ones who have given tha band a 
mixed response. "We were doing 
a gig in Sacramento and this 
reviewer came backstage and 
said one of the lines of our songs 
really moved her, and the next 
day another reviewer said it was 
a piece of shit. The first rule is 
don't bel ieve what you read. You 
must do what you do and not 
live for others," 

If Been sounds like he is 

unhappy with the media, he 
isn 't. He Insists he likes talking 
to anyone who will listen, One 
group he dislikes and talks 
freely about is the record 
executives. 

'ihe company is supportive 
of us now because the album is a 
commercial success, they're 
your friends when you're doing 
well. You have to take record 
industry people with a grain of 
salt. They're all in it for the 
money. The companies are filled 
with lawyers and salesman who 
have no vision, and then they 
wonder why the business is 
slow. 

"There are some people who 
care about the music, but the 
corporate structure is such that 
they have to answer to 60 
lawyers. It is a continual battle 
between the music and the 
money, and the money has the 
final word. These people are 
crazy. If they would wake up, 
they would realize they could 
sell four times as many albums 
at $5.50 than they can sell at 
$8.00," 

Going on to more pleasant 
topics, Been talked about the 
group's relationship with Garth 
Hudson, keyboardist for the 
legendary 60's group The Band. 

"The Band is one of my favorite 
groups of all time and we sent 
Garth a tape and he liked it. He 
played with us on both albums 
and performs with us when he 
can, Again, there are ecomonic 
reasons that prevent him from 
playing with us as much as we 
like." 

Looking ahead, The call plan 
to enter the studio and record 
their third album. As for long 
range plans, Been says, "We want 
to keep playing. We want to be 
like Duke Ellington and play our 
music until we die." 

Been 's interest in movies may 
lead him to write a screenplayor 
do a film score. "It would have 
to be a good movie if it was 
something like Porky's, I 
wouldn't do it. I love Martin 
Scorsese and like the levels he 
works on," 

Right now things are looking 
very bright for the group and the 
.30 year old Been takes it all in 
stride. "I'm glad I can make 
money doing it. I feel lucky and 
I'm not complaining. I have had 
to make sacrifices. There are too 
many people wno are in the 
business for all the wrong 
reasons. I don't want to kill 
myself over a phony image ... 1 
just want to play. " 

The Call will bring ''The walls down" at the gym this 1II0nday when 
they play with The Simple lIIinds and The X-Offenders.

Censorship invades this 
year's ~cademy Award show 
continued from page J 
decree, "films are political 
propaganda if anything in the 
film can be construed to affect 
the po llcies of the US 
government." 

To this form of imposed 
authority Jessica Lange, 
portraying Frances farmer, 
protested, "Who do you think 
you are? Godl Don't I even get a 
lawyer? Haven't I got any civil 
rights?" 

Jessica Lange's Best 
Supporting Oscar for Tootsie 
may have been given by the 
governors of the Academy too 
superfically to allow themselves 
to see frances. 

Jessica Lange's performances 
in frances and Tootsie have 
revealed her dedication to 
making something more than 
making movies. She has 
committed herselfto giving the 
audience in-<lepth depictions 
and commentaries on living in 
our society. 

This dedication to social 
issues has not always been 
appreciated by the motion 
picture industry and movie 
public. Uke Lange, Frances 
farmer, a young actress of the 
30's and 40's expressed, " I am 
not a glamour girl. What do 
press promotions have to do 
with acting? How can I make 
movies when people are 
starving?" 

Frances did not receive an 
Academy Award for her efforts. 

Her attributes were censored 
with a frontal lobotomy to 
"sever the nerves that deliver 
emotional energy to ideas, 
resulting in an emotional 
flattening, diminished 
creativity and imagination," 

Ironically, frances could be 
used to see the similarities 
between the movie industry's 
suppressive policies of the 3O's-
50's and the censorship 
imposed upon politically active 
movie makers of today. 

Some rebels like Costa-
Gavras and Terri Nash are 
breaking away from the benality 
of the last ten years of 
filmmaking with movies like 
frances, Missing, If You Love 
This Planet and A Year of Living 
Dangerously. Now the 
audiences need to open 
themselves more to these 
thought provoking presenta-
tions. 

Movie viewers censor 
themselves and are becoming 
even more conservative than 
the industry, by considering 
frances too dramatic. In our 
depressed times one often hears 
the cliche, "I just want to escape 
from the harsh realities of life 
and be entertained, " Usually 
these people attend movies 
displaying graphic sex and 
violence to self-inflict 
themselves with a frontal 
lobotomy. 

Frances felt. "Our role is not 
just to entertain. We must set 

out to enlighten. We need to 
change the way people perceive 
their lives and their 
responsibilities. "Movies, like 
books, can help us explore and 
develop ourselves so real ity will 
not seem so harsh," 

The most biased and 
influential form of censorship 
comes from some movie critics, 
Their comments either embrace 
the filmmaker as a lover or are 
given as the kiss of death. Some 
critics act like adolescent gods 
as they dole out their volley girl 
comments decorated with stars 
and black dots. 

If movies are today's books, 
critics need to become essa yists 
and teachers , giving us 
reflections beyond the obvious 
and the trivial. 

The diretor of frances ' 
Broadway play could have been 
describing the new critic, "If 
you want to be a true artist 
(critic), you have to see things 
that other people do not. Then 
you can show it to them. Then 
they will see it. Then they will 
remember it. They can more 
fully experience a person 
(movie) through you," 

Movies are like water pumps, 
they need to be primed. The 
Academy has shown us where to 
tind the source of nourishment. 
Now movie viewers need to add 
a little of themselves by 

brin~inQ ideas into the movie 
theater to receive the fullest 
amount of nourishment.

Padres Split First Home Games 
Garvey Impresses Crowd With Power - and Rain 

PHIL LAUDER 
Spor" Editor 

Steve Garvey knows how to 
make his presence known. 

/( was the eighth inning of 
Tuesday night' s 1983 Padres 
home opener. Garvey's first 
game as a Padre in San Diego 
Jack Murphy Stadium. The 
San Francisco Giants were 
leading 6-1, and the former Los 
Angeles Dodger was leading 
off the inning. Earlier in the 
game he had picked on a Fred 
Breini ng del ivery and sent it 
saili ng over the far left field 
wall for the Padre ' lone run 
thus far. He had intentions of 
repeating. The 1·1 pitch was 
hit to almost the arne spot as 
the earlier HR - almost;it 
curved just outside of the foul 
pole during the last 30 feet of 
it<; flight. turning the shot into 
a long strike two.

This Week in Intratnurals 
B y GREGORY MacCRONE 

taff Writer 

Many of u contract a 
malady this time of year 
known a "ba eball fever," 
with the only panacea being 
the formation of an intramural 
softball team. There are about 
265 squads playing this year 
on the Warren, Pryatel, and 
Muir diamonds compri sing 
approximately 2,700 players. 
Although action has already 
gotten underway this quarter, 
softball took a backseat to the 
quickly growing yet not-so-
national pastime, soccer. 

Some 200 onlooker were at 
Warren Field this past Sunday 
to watch Koo's Coors takeon 
Pars I in the oft-delayed AAA 
championship match_ The 
victors may have surprised 
you if you read the Budman 
column which piLled them as 
10-1 underdogs, yet nobody on 
the "hlghl}r psyched" Koo's 
Coors team was surpri ed by 
the outcome of this match -up, 
as they out-finessed their 
season-long nemesis by a score 
of 3-1. 

necessary play whenever the 
action ca me his way. John 
Hickman and Mike Branigan 
did a fine job of marking Pars 
star Mehrdad Banki , constant-
1y stifling him in his attempts 
to move the ball. Doug Koo, the 
team's namesake, Russ Kaye, 
and goalie Rich Pecjak have 
played well all eason and this 
finale wa no exception. 

Said Thompson, "We 
wanted it more and were 
rompletely psyched up for this 
game. We had tied them earlier 
in the season and were 
determined to show that 
Budman dude that we could 
play soccer too." It is obvious 
that these guys can play 
soccer, and very well at that 
Composed of all freshmen and 
one sophomore, Koo 's Coors 
drinking and soccer playing 
buddies should be a force to 
reckon with for years to come.

local medical school, got a 
scare this past weekend when 
Orfice Binds Stickies took 
them into an extra innIng 
before finally 00\\ ing to the 
champs, 6-5. With the ~core 
tied 4-4attheendofregulatlOn 
play, Orfice took to the pl3te , 
and on the strength of a Tony 
Moraghan single and a Grip 
error. went ahead 5-4. Grip , 
champs that they are, got the 
final out and then took their 
cuts at the dish. Player Sohl 

Everett, who went three for 
three. and Dave Wasermann, 
who smacked an HR. The Grip 
team was led at the plate by 
Player Sohl, who had three 
hits in four trip and who has 
been referred to as "Player" 
because his team did not 
follow directions and write 
player's first and last names 
on the scoresheet. 

The Dynasty, led by Tim 
Pickwell on the mound and at 
the plate, dismantled the 
Master Batters in AA 
Phillies League action by a 
score of 14-8. The Master 
Batters committed seven 
miscues. yet kept it relatively 
close on the strength of batters 
Brian Donovan (three for 
three), Ken Zammit (two for 
two including a homerun), and 
John Lessig (t wo for two). The 
Dynasty did their scoring in 
clusters . capitaliz1I1g like

~1ark Edelstein lamented after 
the game that , "It's the first 
time some of these guys have 
had a bat in their hands smce 
last sea so n. We'll get It 
straight next time." 

UCSD's Mike O'Laughlin eyes his tee shot on the first hole 
during Wednes day's four-team tourney. 

Stacy Holm, who ha_ been 
the mainstay of the KC offense 
all sea -on, was just that again 
as he led the winners by 
knocking In two goals. In the 
midfield for\\ard position, 
Barry Thompson and Tom 
Cromwell alternated through-
out the game, with Cromwell 
also kicking one into the net. 
Perhaps more exciting than 
the potent offense was the 
stingy defen e which was led 
by freshman Dennis Guttrich. 
Guttrich played sweeper and 
con tinuously made the 

ingled and was followed by 
Player Zimmer's two-run 
homerun. Top hitters in the 
game for Orfice were Mike 

Dan Jacobsen and Da\'e Kalk

Running Thoughts 
By MIKE GREENBERG and JEFF SAVAGE 

- Staff Writers 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE DEPT. So far we've seen 
evidence which leads us to believe that the San Diego Padre 
faithful should not get too excited about their team's chances 
this year. Even with the addition of first baseman Steve Garvey. 
the Padres sti ll have many glaring weaknesses (liabilities is 
probably a more accurate description) that will prohibit them 
from winning the National League Western Division title. Take 
for instance third base. Luis Salazar is not only t he worst third 
baseman in the major leagues (26 errors last year, and four in 
seven games t his season) but he has proven time and again that 
when the chips are on t he table he won't come through. Salazar 
has stranded more runners in the first eight games this year 
than most guys strand in a season. Manager Dick Williams has 
little alternative to playing Salazar because his backup, Joe 
Lefevrve (a natural outfielder) is a lousy third baseman. The 
starting pitching looks bleak. with the exception of Tim Lollar 
and Eric Show. john Montefusco, Ed Whitson, and Dave 
Dravecky will not win 30 games between them. If General 
\1 anger jack McKeone is as smart as the media has made him out 
to be. San Diego wIiI trade for someone to play t he hot corner , a.., 
well as for an established veteran pitcher. McKeone has a 
:-,urplus of outfielders that he could deal, Gene Richards and 
Ruppert jones being the prIme example'i . The fut un' for San 
Diego is in the younger players anyway. Kevin McReynold.., . 
Tony G" ynn , and Alan Wiggms \\ III probably be the ()ne~ who 
combine to form a nucleus of a dl\ hlon \\ Inner. But right now , 
we just don't ... ee It happening. 
NOT TO BE BELIEVED DEPT. Are we really ..; upposed to 
believe that as announcer Jerr} Coleman "a:·s. there will Ix' no

Padres \iSH Los Angele'i thiS weekend? Sure there won '\.

College Basketball Revie\V 
Favored Hous ton mId Cinderella North Carolina State played a dramatic NCAA Championship 

Game a week ago Monday. Al McGuire analyzes the contest, wall by NCS on a last second alley-oop, 
Welcome to the big time, 

North Carolina State! Houston 
was the odds-on favorite, but 
Albuquerque's sun finally 
smiled on the Wolfpack . 
Tobacco Road got its double 
pack - two NCAA titles back 
to back - from North Carolina 
and now the Wolfpack, 

Before the game, everybody 
threw their chips in Houston's 
corner, but Coach Jim 
Valvano's long-shot club, the 
Cardiac Kid, still tapped out 
the Cougars with the greatest 
a ll ey-oop pass in NCAA 
history, 

Valvano's coaching stock is 
now the darling of Wall Street. 
He's got his safe deposit box 
with optional combination 
locks, and now he can go have 
his hernia taken care of. It's 
the ize of a grapefruit. ft was 
an awful long way from 
beating Wake Forest in OT in 
the fir t game of the Atlantic 
Coast conference tournament, 
but nine games later, the witty 
Italian-American who wears 
his heart on his sleeve, was 
able to cut down the nets 
before milions of people . 

The NCAA final game 
brought back to college 
basketball the three-guard 
offen e and the imporlance of 
the jockeys, You 're only as 
good a the man that takes the 
ball out of bounds on the far 
end, and it showed that any 
David can take Goliath outsIde 
of the paints, The game was 
decided, I think , when with a 
six-point lead, t he Cougars 
went to the hanky-panky. In 
all fairness , it was a good move 
strategIcally by Coach Guy 
LeWIS , who \.\.as tn· 109 to give 
his aIrcraft carrier a breather. 
But It also reminded me a lot of 
\\ ha t happened 10 1977 \\ hen

won the championship. 
That 's what happened, 

Lewis made a move, but it 
backfired, branding the 
Cougars with an NCAA 
runner-up stamp. , 

If a new star was born , It 
was Houston's seven foot 
center, Akeem Abdul Olaju-

by AI MtGuire 
won. And if the baton is passed 
on from Ralph Sampson, it 
now is a push as to whether 
Patrick Ewing or Akeem WIll 
receive it as the new Empire 
State Building of college 
basketball. 

One of the nicest things in 
the tourney was Akeem's 

(tOWELCOMEne) to 11ULIe c;Ime 
getting the MVP award. It 's 
rare, but so deserved, it would 
ha ve been a miscarriage of 
justice if he hadn't been 
picked. The Dream oversha· 
dov,:ed the entire NC State 
front line during the second 
half ... and how long has It 
been stnce a team like NC 
State made the outside shot an 
important weapon? 

The siher lining of thl 
traged\' of the Wolfpack's 
Dereck Whittenburg get ling 
hurt and being out six weeks 

during the season was that it 
allowed Sidney Lowe and 
Terry Gannon to mature and 
gain confidence in their 
abilities. which is why the 
Pack became the greatest 
perimeter shooting team in 
modern NCAA tourney 
history, 

While North Carolina State 
had a nice mixture, bench 
strength appeared as a likely 
soft spot. But Valvano is a 
maestro who orche trated a 
Beethoven's Fifth Basketball 
Symphony, a Park Avenue 
performance that made the 
victory taste a little bit 
sweeter to happy Raleigh fans 
Monday night. A toast to 
Va lvano is definitely in order 
for playing his subs to 
perfection. 

One of Hou ton's problems, 
I think, might have been the 
mental attitude which carried 
over from Saturday night's 
game, Among the press corps, 
there was an undercurrent 
that the championship game 
had already been played 
Saturday night against 
Louisville, and this might have 
affected the Cougars as well. 
There's no dou bt Houston has 
an NBA front line , and Guy 
Lewi did a great Job bringing 
them out of the Southwe!:.t 
Conference, but I think Clyde 
Drexler's four fouls early hurt 
them more than am-one 
realized. All in all, NC State 
was sharper. 

And as in so many earher 
games in t he NCAA -tourney, 
the OPIXlsitl(ln ga,'e :-JC Stale 
one more chance. Afler that. il 
was Val\ano ordering his kids 
to foul the weak man, 
Whittenburg's last Ja\elin 
toss. and Lorenm Charll'~

sky to ..,tuff the tItle awav in

Padres 
decently against the remain -
deroftheGiants line·up, Davis 
has now hit four homeruns in 
six games, tops in either 
league, and ha been the spark 
in the SF offense. 

Things just weren't in sync 
for the home team during the 
first seven innings, as had 
been the case throughout their 
losing streak. While the two 
teams stayed pretty much 
e\en in hit production, the 
Ctants managed t()stnngju~t 
enough of theirs tugether to 
get a run here and a run there 
Ical'ing ju"t four batters on 
ha ... e a Ion.\( tilt' \\a) . On the 
olher hand. San Diego left ten 
runners stranded, includmg 
three in the fourth when 
plnrhhlttt'r Jerry Turner 
ret urned to San DIego, fI YlIIg 
out to end the threat. A team 
that's tn ~) nr puts thn::-.e runs 
acro,;s: a team that's not does 
\\'hat the Padrrs did. 

~ot unt Ii the eighth, 
,-parked by Can e) and hIS 
"fury," did the machllwr} 

begin to click, but it was loo 
little too late, as they say. 

Those final innings of 
Tuesday's game were a s ign of 
things to come in Wednesday's 
affair, as the Padres snapped 
their five-game losing string 
WIth a tight2-1l'ictory behind 
starter Eric Show. The fourth 
inning prOVIded alltheoffem,e 
San Diego needed, two runs, 
and Gary Lucas was 
Impressive in getting his first 
sa vt' of t he year. 

The Pad s are now 3-5 going 
mto the ftnal game of a brief 
t Im·e-game homestand, after

SPAN-----------------------------------------------------------Spanning the Gulf Between College and Reality 
continued from oage 7 
higher average GPA among 
the SPAN students than 
a mong a ve rage col lege 
fres hm e n . The students 
attend all of their classes 
together and, according to 
Oldsen, "really kind of are like 
a family for a year. They cry 
together and study together, 
play together , complain 
together and enjoy them-
selves. Everybody goe s 
through as a group which I 
think is the only reason the 
program really works _" 

SPAN students range in age 
from 20 to 60, and most ha ve 
never considered going to 
college, and many never 
completed high school. SPAN 
provides help with the college 
ad missi on pape rwork, 
financial aid , internships, and 
gives general support to 
students. SDSU provides the 
faculty and classes to give 
SPAN students an education 
and credentials in Human 
Services. 

Yet there is more to the 
SPAN program than just 

fulfilling requirements, as 
John , a current st udent puts it. 
"SPAN is a growth process." 
Oldsen explains, "If a person is 
in a recovery program, they're 
faced with a real important 
decision because they've got to 
make money some way and 
they certainly can't do it the 
way they did before. In many 
cases even if they were in a 
career, a lot of times that 
career was something they 
were not happy with, and that 
contributed to their problems. 
Many people. after they get 
through with recovery, say 
'What am Igoingtodowith my 
life now? What do I have to 
look forward to?' In that ense, 
this program fills that need. 
It's a bridge into a career that's 
going to give them some 
meaning and purpose in their 
lives, and also where they can 
use all the year that they 
maybe aren't rea) proud of, in a 
very con tructive way." John 
adds, "For the recovering 
addict or alcoholic, it's like 
finding a goa\." 

The SDSU faculty ha also 

been pleased with the program 
because, "they see people not 
only progressing academically 
and as counselors, but they see 
a lot of personal growth that 
takes place as well," says 
Oldsen . 

In the past , there has been a 
successf ul rate of job 
placement for SPAN beca use 
of the required field work. 
Fran explains the policy asone 
that will "try to get them into 
the spot that will give them 
entry-level skills they're going 
to need to qualify for a job in 
that area." Upon completion of 
the program, student not only 
have a va lid certificate in 
Human Services, but most 
either find a job, since they 
have learned specific skills or 
become full- or part-time 
students because "they got so 
much out of going to school 
that they wanted tocontinue," 
states Oldsen. 

Kelly, who graduated from 
SPAN in 1981 , is one example 
of SPAN's high success rate. 
A a recovering alcoholic, she 
explains, people are "looking 

Say "Ida" 

for authenticity In their 
recovery process, they have 
this incredible need to pass it 
on and to help," yet the 
prospect of pending four 
years in college for some sort of 
qualifying certificate gets 
people "very, very discour· 
aged." 

SPAN, on the other hand, 
"took my certificate from the 
chool of 'hard knocks'," 'iays 

Kelly . She says that "in the 
recovery process, whether it 
be from drug or alcohol or 
from having been incarcerated 
- from the many traps that 
there are ... you come to a place 
where you have to decide 
whether you believe in what 
you're doing or not, if you 
really want to turn that 
around. It's a very difficult 
decision, you're sticking your 
neck out a long way because 
you have to learn everything 
new all over again ... to come 
along into a program like this 
where they kind of put things 
on a platter and say, 'Thi s is 
how you turn it around, this is 
what you had and this is what

it can be,' and you have to be 
the instrument in between." 

Kelly worked at the 
Vo lun teers of America 
detoxification center in 
downtown San Diego after 
graduating from SPAN and 
because of her "demonstrated 
abili ty," as she puts it, she was 
transferred to a director 
position at the East County 
Emergency Center in El Cajon. 
"It was in a lot of trouble when 
I got there. J pulled out all my 
ski lls and I brought in as many 
people as I could to help and we 
got it back on its feet and 
functioning and it was able to 
go without me." 

Currently, Kelly owns and 
operates a small odds and ends 
shop next to the SPAN 
headquarters. The neighbor· 
hood is run down , and she says 
tha t 80 percent of the residellts 
are "walking people," and 
many are enior citizen 
and/or alcoholics. Through 
her store, she has become 
involved in the comm unity, 
and sits on a steer ing 
com mitt ee for the loca l 
merchants organizaton. She 
would like to use her store, 
whic h has comfortab le 
furniture, as a meeting place 
for the local senior cit izens and 
their activities and as it place 
to hold community Alcoholics 
Anonymous meetings. 

Presently, she focuses on an 
"economic need" by selling 
useful second-hand items to 
customers whi le developing 
friendly relationship with 
them. She says "word gets 
around that 'Oh, Sue's a 
counselor,' and if you've got a 
problem you can come in and 
confide ... So I'm ·till able to 
use all that I learned going 
through SPAN, here, and it 
enhances what I'm doing." 

She feels that SPAN wa a 
major factor in giving her self-
esteem, "I look at my life as a 
giant jigsaw puzzle, and you 
know you get really frustrated 
because there are pieces you 
can't find. Then when you find 
one, you get this incredible 
case of the 'ah·ha's!' , ah·ha, it 
fits! And SPA was one of 
those major key pieces of my 
puzzle that just put the rest of 
the puzzle together for me, or 
at least it's helping me to form 
the bulk oC the puzzle." 

Old sen claims, " I love doing 
this, it's fantastic because it's 
so rewarding to see that much 
change take place in people 
over a short period of 
time ... when someone's really 
ready, it's incredible what 
they can accomplish." John 
jokes, "SPAN is Fran's first 
child ." 

Oldsen also expla1l1s that 
"Ihe main rea<;on we\'e heen 
able to keep this program 
going ... is that there's a lot of 
networking groups ancl 
coalition groups within the 
fie ld of chemIcal dependency. 
There is a lot of interaction 
lx·t ween people who work in 
all these prograrm ... the people 
in the field really relate to this 
0,0 a lot of them ha ve gi ven us 
all kinds of support." 

She sums it up by saying, "1 
think t he idea of SPAN (is)that 
you can take a person who 
spent a lot of time In negative 
situatIons thinking very 
nega tive thoughts, and put 
(them) into a kind of a 
main'itream that just kind of 
grooms them to turn all (lfthat 
negatIvity around and to use it 
in a positive way ... there's a lot 
of faith that moves things and 
ca uses things to happen. I just 
ca ll it magic .it's a magic 
program!"
