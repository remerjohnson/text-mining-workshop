UCSD Joins UC-Wide Student 
Health Insurance Plan to Save Money
By Anqi Chen
Staff Writer

UCSD decided to opt into UC-SHIP the 
weekend of April 4, after hesitating to join the 
UC-wide student health insurance plan due 
to concerns that the university’s competitive 
mental healthcare rates, co-insurance 
discounts and dental and vision benefits 
might be lost under the systemwide plan.

The systemwide health insurance plan 
will combine the insurance plans of over 
130,000 students across 10 UC campuses, in 
addition to UC Hastings College of Law. The 

plan — which will go into effect Aug. 15 — 
aims to give students more pharmaceutical 
and treatment benefits and provide a 
dependent-plan option for families. It aims 
to reduce student coverage fees, but they 
were not lowered at UCSD.

With a campuswide plan, the UC system 
negotiated a better rate with Anthem Blue 
Cross and Blue Shield.

“It is clear that savings have been 
achieved, but there is no hard number yet,” 
UC Office of the President spokesperson

Parking citation amounts have increased by 
$15 since Jan. 3, after the Transportation Policy 
Committee approved the increase on Dec. 6.

The citation amounts increased in response to 
increased state surcharges, which went from $9.50 
to $12.50 on Dec. 7. As a result, the transportation 
service department must offset the additional 
surcharges. According to the committee meeting 
minutes, Transportation Services Associate Director 
Todd Berven presented scenarios that increased 
parking citations by $3, $5, $10 or $15. 

Management and Planning Communications 
Director Rex Graham said in an email that the 
committee was considering  other possible increases 
that ranged from $0 to $100. 

“Some wanted to increase the fees by considerably 
more than [$15],” he wrote. “$15 was the middle 
ground for the proposed fee increases. I cannot 
speak to why the committee chose $15.”

The committee — an advisory board of  six 
faculty and staff members, two undergraduates and 
one graduate student — voted 5-2 for approving the 
citation increase, which passed. 

A.S. representative Adam Powers and UCSD 
Healthcare representative Ray Osborne were absent 
from the Dec. 6 meeting. The individuals who 
voted against the fee increase were Student College 
Council Representative Karleen Ronsairo and staff 
representative Paul DeWine. Vice Chancellor of 
Resource Management and Planning Russell 
Thackston, who was present at the meeting, then 
approved the increase.

Citation amounts for 20 of 25 types of violations 
went up by $15; these citations include not having a 
parking permit — which now costs $65 to pay off,  
as opposed to $50. If the fees are not paid within 21 
days, the fee is doubled, so the possible total is $150, 
compared to last year’s $120. 

The citation amounts that remained the same 
include $450 for having no placard, $450 for parking 
in a disabled zone, $450 for misusing a disabled 
person parking placard, $150 for a boot fee and $20 
for a non-sufficient funds fee.

Graham said the increases are a way to address 
the department’s financial situation, since A.S. 
Council rejected a $25 student fee referendum last 
year.  Faculty Welfare committee representative and 
psychology professor Timothy Rickard agreed that 
the increase was for revenue reasons.

“The reason it’s at the level that it is our parking 
citation fees having been previously below what 
the case is at, for example, UCLA and, some other 
UC schools that we use for comparison,” Rickard 
said. “[It is one] of many decisions that will need to 
be made to make revenue for the parking services 
overall that just brings us in line with what is the case 
at other universities that we use for examples.”

UCLA’s website states that the fine for not 
displaying a ticket is $58. Their highest fine is $508 
for an invalid or misused disabled placard.

“The citation fee increase was not implemented 
to help TS’ financial situation,” Graham wrote. 

The UC Berkeley’s website states that revenue 
from citations on UC campuses cannot be used to 
build parking, but they can cover enforcement costs.

E fforts stalled Wednesday to pass an A.S. Council resolution that called for the UC system to divest funds from 
non-neutral corporations currently provid-
ing technology to the Israeli Defense Forces. 
This is the second year the resolution, 
proposed by Students for Justice in Palestine, 
has been brought before council. 

Last year’s version called for divestment 
from all companies that profit from human 
rights violations,, and did not explicitly 
mention Israel. TFI members claimed they 
were excluded from the drafting of last year’s 
resolution and felt alienated on campus, 
which led to contention with SJP. A.S. 
Council voted 13-10-4 to create a committee 
on the topic before moving forward, but the 
issue dropped after the committee failed to 
reach a consensus. 

At the same time, the UC Berkeley A.S. 
Council passed a resolution 16-4 to divest 
funds from Israel, but the resolution was 
later vetoed by then-ASUC President Will 
Smelko. 

Conflicts originally ensued after SJP 
announced its plan to present a resolution 
at the April 13 council meeting, but the 
respective organizations then planned to 
pursue a joint resolution for the 2011-12 
academic year that reflected the beliefs of 

both sides. The orgs planned to announce 
this effort on April 27, but TFI withdrew 
support hours before the Wednesday council 
meeting. 

Both Social Sciences Senator Rena 
Zuabi, a supporter of the resolution, and TFI 
Executive Board member Michael Yadegaran 
described the collaboration as “risky.”

“It’s been an emotional roller coaster,” 
Yadegaran said. “Something like this 
[collaboration] on campus is unprecedented. 
Any cooperation between SJP and TFI [in 
the past] has been forced by A.S. and it’s only 
happened once and it was a complete failure.”

A.S. Council had planned to vote on the 
resolution at last night’s council meeting, but 
in light of the failed joint resolution, the issue 
has been tabled, with SJP stating its intention 
to move forward with the divestment efforts. 

“Some TFI members said they have big 
big problems with the wording and the basic 
ideas that were put forth and agreed upon 
before,” Zuabi said. “We were told we can’t 
release this statement. TFI didn’t want to 
include ideas of neutrality in investments. 
SJP wanted to keep this basic [tenet] of the 
original resolution.”

TFI Vice President Daniel Friedman 
expressed disagreement with specific clauses 
of the joint resolution.

“TFI is firm in its stance that A.S. is not 
the place for a specific groups of different 
political views to [have dialogue],” TFI Vice 
President Daniel Friedman said. “Especially 
with divestment, which is bigger than just 
an Israel issue. The resolution had multiple 

identical clauses from last 
year’s [resolution]. Ultimately, 
we can’t support something 
that damages our university’s 
image and effectively punishes 
the Israeli defense forces for 
defending its citizens.”

The original draft of the 
resolution stated that UCSD is currently 
invested in the stocks of both General 
Electric and Northrop Grumman through 
the endowment and retirement funds. 
According to SJP, both companies are 
connected to the Israeli and Palestinian 
conflict because they supply the Israeli army 
with helicopter parts and weapons to use 
against the Palestinian army.

“The [original] resolution was only 
targeting Israel,” Friedman said. “It was an 
attempt to demonize the state and effectively 
collect punishment.”

Researchers Monitor Fatigue in Brain With Cell Phone
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

By Sarah Smith
Contributing Writer

UCSD researchers have figured out 
how to detect fatigue by monitoring 
the brain with a headset, which 
transmits signals to a cell phone. 

In the past, brain-computer 
interface systems were used to 
treat nervous system disorders, but 
Swartz Center for Computational 
Neuroscience Associate Director 
Tzyy-Ping Jung and his team focused 
on fatigue in people’s everyday lives — 
particularly for professionals such as 
air traffic controllers and truck drivers, 
for whom a lapse in concentration can 
be fatal.

“Most research in this area is trying 
to develop research for [a] patient’s 
nervous system, like patients who are 
paralyzed with no control over their 
muscles,” Jung said. “We’re trying 
to target a larger goal. Even healthy 
people suffer impairments such as 
falling asleep while driving, and we’re 
trying to detect and prevent that.”

Working with the Brain Research 

Center at the National Chiao Tung 
University in Taiwan, the researchers 
used a headset to monitor the 
electrical activity produced by the 
firing of neurons in the brain. 

The electroencephalographic 
(EEG), or neural, signals were then 
relayed to a Nokia N97 cell phone, 
which was programmed to monitor 
any fluctuations. When the EEG 
spectrum rises above a certain level, 
indicating that the subject is getting 
drowsy, the phone produces an alert 
to wake the user. 

Another difference in Jung’s 
approach is that the brain is 
continuously monitored with a 
portable phone as opposed to a more 
traditional off-site location, where 
subjects are monitored on a large EEG 
machine in a laboratory.

Jung said the cell phone was 
chosen for its popularity in Taiwan 
and its portable size. As a result, the 
platform can continuously monitor 
and analyze brain activity at any place 
and time. 

The first step of the onsite research 

was developing a smaller headset, 
according to Jung. 

“A typical EEG system is very 
bulky, with dangling wires and an 
amplifier connected to a computer,” 
Jung said. “It is not very practical 
in real-world applications because no 
one is going to wear it in real life. We 
needed to develop technology that 
can enable EEG monitoring outside 
laboratories.”

One study involved 10 subjects 
wearing wireless EEG headbands and 
looking at computer screens with 
numbers arranged to mimic a phone 
touch pad. 

The subjects’ goal was to dial a 
phone number by looking at those 
displayed on the screen, which flashed 
at different rates.

When a subject looked at a 
number, the signal from the visual 
cortex was transmitted through 
Bluetooth technology. The phone 
received signals, entered the numbers 
and placed the call. There was a 
90-percent accuracy rate among most 
participants.  

“The best part about the equipment 
is that people don’t need training,” 
Jung said. “This is involuntary. The 
brain is driven by flashing visual 
stimuli.”

Jung said the sensors do not require 
preparation or conductive paste. They 
have no plans to sell the device.

“The research can open up 
numerous new opportunities to 
monitoring brain activity in real-
world environments, ranging from 
cognitive-state monitoring lapse of 
attention to seizure prediction,” Jung 
said.

There have been 32 researchers, 
mostly at the post-doctoral level, 
working at SCCN.  Each researcher 
works on two to five different projects, 
often collaborating with each other.

“As the brain is the most 
sophisticated ‘machine’ in the world, 
we need researchers from different 
disciplines to work together to study 
the brain,” Jung said.

BE THE
VOICE

This week’s meeting was held in Price Center East Ballroom in anticipation of 
the divestment resolution, which, 
if passed, would have asked the UC 
system to divest 
from companies 
providing 
the Israeli 
Defense Forces 
with military 
technologies used 
in attacks on 
Palestine. 

Initially, the public half of the 
ballroom was about a quarter full. 
Most of the public slowly filed out 
after Social Sciences Senator Rena 
Zuabi announced that the Students 
for Justice in Palestine and Tritons 
For Israel worked together to 
create a joint statement. However, 
not every member in TFI felt 
comfortable with the new draft, so 
the groups will not be pursuing the 
resolution until next year.

TFI President Lior Abramson 
apologized to those affected by 
the change. She said the intention 
was for the two groups to find a 
common ground but, in the short 
time period they had, they didn’t 
have the means to find it. 

The next issue presented 
came from the Asian and Pacific 
Islander Student Alliance. APSA 
Vice President of Finance Thai Do 
and Social Programming Chair 
Allan Castaneda asked council to 
reconsider their request for funding 
their graduation banquet — which 
is projected to cost $8,778.71 
this year — that has occurred for 
24 years, and relied on council 
funding for the last few. 

The location of the venue was a 
problem because it was off campus 
and not within a five-mile range 
of campus, creating liability issues. 

However, APSA members brought 
up how council funded other other 
off campus events. 

The biggest problem was 
that APSA had signed a binding 

contract with 
their venue 
before receiving 
funding, and the 
org would still be 
required to pay 
the venue full 
price even if the 
group could not 

use it. The vote on whether to fund 
APSA the full amount was 15-15-2, 
so it did not pass. 

VP of Finance and Resources 
Andrew Ang and AVP of Student 
Organizations Carli Thomas gave 
APSA the option of an underwrite. 
Ang said that student organizations 
that fail to make the payment on 
time make a presentation about the 
ways they attempted to raise funds 
and council can choose to forgive 
the debt. 

But Do and Castaneda were 
hesitant to agree to it without 
talking to their members first. 
They were also reluctant because 
the underwrite would go under 
one of their members’ names, and 
that student could be charged the 
full amount if APSA failed to raise 
enough money by their deadline; 
he or she also wouldn’t be allowed 
to graduate until the payment was 
received. 

Do and Castaneda asked council 
if they could have more time to 
discuss the option of an underwrite 
with their board. Council tabled 
the decision until next week.

The meeting ended shortly 
after the discussion while a student 
played with Campuswide Senator 
Deyna Robinson’s energetic son in 
public seating.

Abramson commented on the progress 
of the two organizations at the April 27 
council meeting. 

“I do think that this should be the 
beginning of a story of cooperation and 
not the end of a resolution,” Abramson 
said at the meeting. 

Zuabi explained why there 
was not going to be a presentation 

anymore.“There was a draft 
statement created last night to express 
commitment to that effort based off 
of original agreements,” Zuabi said. 
“Members of TFI are uncomfortable 
and contested current ideas.”

The two organizations have put 
their collaborative efforts on hold 
and are pursuing alternative ways to 
address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

“We both had good intentions with 
this,” Zuabi said. “I don’t think TFI 
is ready to work on this dialogue yet. 
[SJP] plans on moving forward with 
divestment next year.”

UC-Wide Insurance Plan Covers 90 Percent of  Travel Vaccines 
Leslie Sepuka said. 

UCSD Student Health Services 
Director Regina Fleming said the costs 
are lower because they do not have 
an insurance broker, not because of 
premiums.

Fleming said she does not have 
numbers for UCSD because they are 
not medically relevant and are based 
on numbers from a consulting firm. 
The committee first suggested opting 
out because the current plan had the 
same premium and offered a more 
comprehensive coverage for students. 
As a result, UC-SHIP representatives, 
who negotiate with insurance 
companies, contacted Fleming in 
February in hopes of reaching an 
agreement with UCSD.

“The initial decision was not to 
join the UC-wide plan,” Fleming said. 
“We were contacted by the [UC]
OP and discussions continued at a 

higher campus level. There was a huge 
incentive for UCSD to join because 
as time went on, all other campuses 
joined [UC-SHIP].” 

During negotiations, UCSD was 
provided the option to opt out of 
certain benefits, like full vision and 
dental coverage that were 40 percent 
more expensive under UC-SHIP. 

“[UCSD was] provided the 
flexibility to maintain their local 
arrangements for dental and vision 
coverage to ensure the most cost-
effective plan for students,” Sepuka 
said. 

Furthermore, Graduate Student 
Association Vice President of Finance 
Taylor Bright said costs for dental 
coverage and experience claims 
looked too high, so he asked UCOP to 
recalculate them.

The recalculated plan provides 
lowered premium rates. Before 
recalculations, UCSD students 

would have to pay an eight-percent 
increase for UC-SHIP, from $290 to 
$315. But an increase would have 
occurred regardless, because the 
insurance companies increase the 
premium every year, Fleming said. 
UC-SHIP allows UCSD students 
to keep the same dental and 
vision benefits, but receive better 
immunization and pharmacy co-pay 
coverage. 

Under UCSD’s current plan, 
students would have to pay $25 for 
some vaccines and full price for others.  
Under UC-SHIP, all vaccines except 
those required for international 
travel are free. UC-SHIP also covers 
90 percent of travel vaccines that 
students need for certain study 
abroad programs. This benefit is not 
available under UCSD’s current plan.

Webpage Indicating New Citation Amounts Not Available
The transportation budget is facing 

a $3-million funding deficit that 
is mostly caused by repair costs to 
the Arbor Parking Structure at the 
Hillcrest Medical Center. The structure 
is expected to collapse within the next 
five to 10 years, unless it is rebuilt with 
an estimated $30-to-$50 million.

“Transportation Parking Services 
department only has so many ways 

they can adjust to make up for budget 
deficits,” Powers said. “They can either 
cut services, which means shuttles 
away, or they can raise rates, which 
means raising parking permit rates and 
raising parking citation rates .”

Graham said the citation increase 
has not helped with Transportation 
Services’ financial situation. The 
webpage for citation penalty amounts 
for 2010 were taken down during 

the week of Jan. 3. The new penalty 
amounts have not been displayed 
online since January. Graham said 
there would not be any potential 
increases in the near future.

TPC chair William Trogler and 
DeWine could not be contacted at press 
time.

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN www.UCSDGUARDIAN.oRG/oPINIoNTHURSDAY, APRIL 28, 2011

When I was little, my mother was always quick to remind me: “There’s 
no such thing as a free lunch.” What 
she meant, of course, was that the 
best deals in life come at a price — 
whether you accept some stranger’s 
favor and become their mob bitch 
(a la “The Departed”), or end up 
being paid by your roommate to tell 
embarrassingly tepid jokes in front 
of her 200-person class so that she 
can get extra credit.   

     But when I entered college, I 
couldn’t really afford to be so choosy. 
My wallet got a little tighter and my 
appetite for OVT’s disgusting selec-
tions plummeted. (Why, “Meatless 
Monday?” Why?) 

My friends and I instinctively 
began to seek out what college stu-
dents love best: free food. We quickly 
realized that one of the simplest 
ways to snag a free snack (as close to 
free as I can get, Mom) was through 
Sprinkles Cupcakes’ Twitter feed.

Every morning at around 10 a.m., 
the trendy (read: expensive) cupcake 
shop updates its Twitter feed and 
Facebook page with a new “secret” 
phrase of the day. The first 50 people 
to whisper that phrase in store get a 
free cupcake — usually an exclusive 
flavor of the day that you can brag 
about to your uninformed friends, 
like chocolate cake filled with marsh-
mallow cream topped with peanut 
butter frosting. (Actually, that one 
was disgusting.) 

For those too lazy to sprint to 
Sprinkles at a moment’s notice, 
it’s also possible to comment on 
Sprinkles’ Facebook update, where 
five people get chosen at random for 
a free cupcake coupon. 

Of course, with 500-plus people 
commenting every day and only five 
lucky winners, I really can’t be both-
ered. I have better things to do with 
my time, like looking up adorable 
pug videos on YouTube.

Recently, early morning lines 
at Sprinkles have been short to 
nonexistent, other than the occa-
sional junkie purchasing her daily 
dozen hogging up the line, but 
it was an entirely different story 
when the store first opened back in 
January.  

The endless quest for my first 
Sprinkles cupcake was tainted by 
three-hour lines wrapping around 
the store. Very little (besides a 
cupcake) could soothe my raging 
anger at the hordes of morose, sugar-
deprived patrons. Why did they feel 
the need to pay $3.50 for a designer 
cupcake? I wanted to pay $3.50 for a 
cupcake. 

In due time, the lines waned, and 
my tally of free cupcakes has reached 
six. I can now get a free cupcake in 
less than 10 minutes (driving time 
included!), and I’m no longer inter-
ested in paying three dollars for one. 

Though I will sometimes go out 
of my way, I only do so on occasion, 
and when I actually have time to go. 
That way, I don’t feel quite so crazy 
for checking their feed every morn-
ing. It’s easier to seem normal when 
you’re not foaming at the mouth for 
Irish cream frosting.

After another divestment resolution stalls on the A.S. Council floor, two student 
orgs will have to cooperate in the interest of constructive dialogue.

Back to the Start 

In the span of 24 hours from Tuesday to Wednesday, two divided campus communi-
ties made an unprecedented step 
toward compromise — and then 
took it all back. 

On the heels of another Israel-
Palestine divestment resolution, 
members of Students for Justice 
in Palestine and Tritons for Israel 
— the student orgs that have sup-
ported and opposed the petition 
in the past, respectively —  met 
last Friday, April 22, to discuss 
the controversial issue, which is 
brought like clockwork before 
A.S. Council each spring. But a 

few hours before Wednesday’s 
council meeting, members of TFI 
withdrew their support of the 
joint statement after hearing dis-
sent from members of its commu-
nity. And now the two groups are 
back at square one with no agree-
ment and no compromise, only 
a promise on the part of SJP that 
the group will pursue divestment 
again in the coming year.

A refresher: This is the second 
year SJP has introduced its divest-
ment resolution, a resolution 
that, last year, packed the coun-
cil’s Forum and produced 5 a.m. 
meetings with tempers running 

high on both sides. This year, just 
two speakers addressed council 
during public input, taking up 
only a fraction of their allotted 20 
minutes. 

The resolution calls for the UC 
system to take a neutral stance 
on the Israel-Palestine conflict by 
stopping its investment in compa-
nies such as General Electric and  
Northrop Grumman, companies 
that currently build parts of the 
helicopters used in the Middle 
East. Although UC President 
Mark G. Yudof has already stated 
that the university will not divest

Executive Board

This quarter, UCSD Students for Justice in Palestine was organizing a “Resolution to 
Divest from Companies Profiting 
from Violent Conflict.” The resolu-
tion addressed General Electric and 
Northrop Grumman, two compa-
nies that provide parts of Apache 
helicopters that have been docu-
mented by Human Rights Watch 
and Amnesty International to cause 
civilian deaths in the Palestinian ter-
ritories.

The resolution was originally set 
to be presented on April 20, 2011. In 
respect to those students observing 
Passover, specifically those connect-
ed with the resolution, SJP leader-
ship agreed to postpone the presen-
tation until April 27, 2011.  On April 
22, 2011, five days before the resolu-
tion was to be presented, an unaf-
filiated third party council member 
arranged for representatives from 
Tritons for Israel and SJP to meet.

In this meeting, SJP conditional-
ly offered to include certain propos-
als put forth by TFI in a new draft 
of the resolution. There were certain 

core elements of SJP’s mission state-
ment and the resolution that could 
not be negotiated upon. The rep-
resentatives of TFI agreed to those 
terms and the process of outlining 
a new project continued.  Though 
members of SJP had spent over two 
years working on the resolution (in 
addition to the two years of research 
done by students at UC Berkeley), 
SJP agreed to work with the group 
for the betterment of campus cli-
mate. Moreover, despite numerous 
failed attempts at a joint resolution 
in the past, SJP took a leap of faith 
in the spirit of putting forth a more 
inclusive effort.

After being informed that the 
board members of TFI were unani-
mously behind this joint project, 
representatives of the organizations 
worked until the early morning of 
April 27 to draft a statement defin-
ing intentions and mutual goals. SJP 
expressed its unwavering intent to 
include the companies stated in the 
original resolution as well as other 
corporations profiting from the per-
petuation of ongoing violent con-
flict. Furthermore, SJP agreed to the 
recommendation of support-

A Leap of  Faith Fell Flat Unfair Bias Halted Talks
By Tritons for Israel
Executive Board

It is with a heavy heart that I begin this piece for publication. Recently Students 
for Justice in Palestine authored a 
resolution asking the Associated 
Student body to call upon the UC 
Regents to divest the investments 
of the pension and retirement 
funds from two American 
companies because they did 
business with the Israeli Defense 
Forces.
     We heard at a special 
presentation how this year’s 
divestment resolution was “a 
brand-new resolution” and had 
nothing to do with last year’s 
resolution, when in truth 11 of the 
clauses are exact quotes from last 
year’s divestment resolution. We 
were told that this was not meant 
to target the State of Israel, but 
rather it was focused on the region 
as a whole. 
     Sadly this too was not true, 
as the State of Israel was the 
only sovereign country to be 
mentioned in the resolution, and 
it was “mentioned” over 17 times. 

We even heard about how the 
resolution was meant to foster 
dialogue, when the only dialogue 
created around the event was done 
so by the A.S. President-elect, 
and not by the proponents of the 
resolution.
     Despite the blatant attack 
on the State of Israel, and 
consequently the Israel, and 
pro-Israel communities at UCSD, 
Tritons for Israel extended a hand 
in peace to the leadership of 
Students for Justice in Palestine 
in the hopes that some sort of 
dialogue and compromise could be 
reached. Two representatives from 
Tritons for Israel worked tirelessly, 
despite the Jewish holiday of 
Passover, to reach a middle ground 
and bridge the gap between our 
two respective communities.
    On the brink of a historic 
opportunity, Students for Justice in 
Palestine retreated to their original 
talking points, and even failed to 
recognize the need for cultural 
cooperation, or the necessity for 
ensuring the security of both 
Palestinians and Israelis.
     That, however, has become a

from the two companies, the divest-
ment issue remains a important 
symbolic gesture that SJP members 
have compared to 
the move to divest 
from South Africa 
in the 1990s. UCSD 
isn’t alone; last year, 
the UC Berkeley 
council debated a 
similar resolution 
and passed it 16-4, 
but that decision 
was vetoed by then-
ASUC President 
Will Smelko. 
Petitions have been 
started at Harvard and MIT, among 
other schools. 

Last year, the resolution failed 
again and the issue remained stag-
nant, despite A.S.-enforced attempts 
for the two groups to work together 

in a committee. The failure of last 
year’s effort makes this willing 
outreach on the part of the groups’ 
executive boards all the more com-

mendable, and we 
hope that the execu-
tive members of 
next year’s boards 
are equally open to 
collaboration. 

But despite the 
optimistic begin-
ning, poor commu-
nication has again 
prevented these two 
groups from reach-
ing a consensus on 
an issue so impor-

tant to both and perhaps alienated 
them once again. Given the 11th-
hour withdrawal of support from 
TFI members, the group’s position 
may be hampered next year; worse, 
with this failed attempt, the two 

groups may write off compromise 
altogether. 

With an issue so fraught with 
tension and history, and one that is 
so regularly discussed, a weekend, 
even with the best intentions, won’t 
be enough to come to a satisfactory 
conclusion. The two orgs should 
start a dialogue on the resolution 
earlier in the year, and both execu-
tive boards should be clear on their 
goals and duties. 

This time, TFI withdrew due to 
last-minute internal disagreements; 
should there be a similar problem 
next year, both orgs should be clear 
on how they want to determine 
their positions, be it according to 
its executive board, or through the 
wishes of its larger community. 
Once both organizations decide 
how they want to address the issue, 
they can hopefully work together to 
move forward. 

Failed Attempt Shouldn’t Deter Orgs from Collaboration

ing companies that develop both 
Palestinian and Israeli society. This 
statement was intended to increase 
cooperation and communication 
between members of each commu-
nity. 

On the afternoon of April 27, a 
few hours before the council meet-
ing, TFI informed SJP that they 
would not be supportive of the joint 
statement because the core elements 
originally agreed upon became wide-
ly contested in their community.  By 
this time, SJP informed the larger 
community that a new joint project 
would be pursued and the current 
resolution would not be presented. 

The last-minute nature of TFI’s 
retraction has demonstrated to the 
campus community that this level of 
critical dialogue is not a priority for 
their organization. Further negotia-
tion on this issue with a group that 
has disregard for the fundamental 
aims of the original resolution for 
corporate responsibility and neutral 
investments will prove futile. It is 
evident that SJP’s mission statement 
of “organizing in accordance with 
democratic principles to promote 
justice, human rights and the right of 
self-determination for the Palestinian 
people” is also not a priority for 
the leadership of Tritons for Israel. 
Above all, the unanswered call for 
institutional neutrality on the UCSD 
campus demonstrates a blatant indif-
ference towards the Principles of 
Community and the moral standards 
set by this university. 

SJP at UCSD expresses their 
full intention to move forward with 
divestment in the 2011-12 school 
year. All members of the UCSD com-
munity are welcome to take part in 
this process.

moot point. The question we must 
ask ourselves is, where do we go 
from here? 

We may never come to an 
agreement about divestment, but 
should we allow that to prevent a 
greater dialogue from happening?
     Call me an idealist, but I firmly 
believe that the things which 
divide us pale in comparison to 
those which can unite us. If a 

compromise 
cannot be 
reached 
surrounding 
divestment, 
I feel we 
should 
respect 
each other’s 
positions, 
agree to 
disagree, 
and search 
for the 
common 

ground we all share.
      Has there not been enough 
suffering on both sides? Now is 
the time to end this fighting, both 
on campus at UCSD and in our 
respective homelands.
     Tritons for Israel has always 
and will continue to stand for 
peace, dialogue, and justice. 
Divestment is not the way to a 
durable peace. Only by speaking 
to one another can we achieve a 
true understanding, and build the 
bridges necessary for a sustainable 
coexistence. Tritons for Israel hopes 
that we will someday have a willing 
partner in the struggle to achieve a 
sustainable end to the conflict, both 
in the Middle East and here on our 
campus.

With an issue 
so fraught with 
tension and history, 
a weekend won’t 
be enough to come 
to a satisfactory 
conclusion.

SOAP ROCK
T his year’s Kuncocshun — Sixth College’s contribution to the spring quarter festival mayhem — is made for the ladies. Brown-eyed heartthrobs you’ve probably heard on your favorite TV melodrama (i.e. “Grey’s Anatomy” and “One Tree Hill”) will be headlining the event this Friday, and within steps of the stage you’ll find free chocolate, sorbet and cotton candy — the perfect recipe for a lonely heart.

BY ARIELLE SALLAI AND REN EBEL • HIATUS EDITORS

From his tame, fedora-toting scruffiness to his catalogue 
of affecting radio ballads, Greg Laswell has devoted 
himself fully to his brand of Chicken Soup for the Soccer 
Mom’s Soul acoustic rock. Songs like “Girls Just Want to 
Have Fun,” a solemn, piano-driven re-imagining of the 
Lauper classic, sound as though they might reinforce a 
tearful goodbye on any number of television melodra-
mas. And they have. The San Diego native has gained 
increasing critical attention since 2007 as his bittersweet 
melodies have graced the soundtracks of TV’s premier 
romdrams, including “The Hills,” “True Blood” and 
“Grey’s Anatomy,” as well as some feature films such as 
“My Sister’s Keeper” and “Confessions of a Shopaholic.” 
With only four studio albums under his belt, Laswell has 
clearly met unprecedented success in establishing him-
self as a decisive singer/songwriter to watch.

The CW sure likes its music. The 
network hocks indie rock finds at the 
end of every episode, its characters 
vomit references to their favorite 
bands and its stars ditch their respec-
tive melodramas for music careers 
of their own (Taylor Momsen’s the 
Pretty Reckless is the worst of the 
bunch). The seemingly never-ending 
“One Tree Hill,” however, has one 
pretty face with a voice worth men-
tioning. Tyler Hilton, who once 
played the cocky singer-songwriter 
Chris Keller on the teen soap, was an 
artist before he landed the CW job 
in 2004. After 16 episodes he ditched 
the show to focus on his music career 
— and land a part as Elvis Presley in 
the Oscar-winning “Walk the Line.” 
For his headlining gig at this year’s 
Kuncocshun, expect the heartthrob to 
grace Warren Field with his brand of 
pursed-lipped crooning. With a pen-
chant for heart-melting melodies and 
acoustic plucking, Hilton’s often com-
pared to fellow singer-songwriters

Beastie Boys
Hot Sauce Committee Pt. Two

A t the end of “Fight For Your Right (Revisited),” the new music video “sequel” to the ’87 MTV 
classic “Fight For Your Right (to 
Party),” a young version of the Beastie 
Boys (with Elijah Wood as Ad-Rock, 
Seth Rogen as Mike D and Danny 
McBride as MCA) face off against 
their future selves (played by Will 
Ferrell, John C. Reilly and Jack Black, 
respectively) in a NYC street dance-
off — culminating in a piss-off (liter-
ally) and arrest by the real Beasties.

It’s a video comically befitting the 
trio’s contradictions: They’re grizzled 
veterans, yet blissfully juvenile — and 
prepared to take urine in the face with 
stride.

But the Brooklyn natives have 
owned this identity for years. Youth 
has ruled Adam “Ad-Rock” Horovitz, 
Adam “MCA” Yauch and Michael 
“Mike D” Diamond since their debut 
Licensed to Ill. But alongside junior-
high humor, hip-hop swag and a 
hardcore energy, they’ve also touted an 
instantly legendary appeal, with their 
taste for genre-bending more influen-
tial than their punk-ass ‘tude implies.

Their latest release Hot Sauce 
Committee Part Two is no different, 
marking a return to adolescent-old-
timer form since 2004’s more hip-hop 
focused To the Five Boroughs (we’ll 
forget their ’07 instrumental throw-
away The Mix Up). 

Like the group’s ’98 hit Hello Nasty, 
the album marries the Beastie’s some-
times divergent interests in hip hop 
and punk. Unlike earlier albums that 
traded off between the two genres, 
jittering samples and head-nodding 
beats are layered over heavy guitar 
wail (most evident on the Black Flag-
riffing “Lee Majors Come Again”) like 
an imaginary collaboration of Henry 
Rollins and LL Cool J. 

Though they’ve become less hedo-
nistic since their youth, they’re still 
rebellious as ever. Lead single “Make 
Some Noise” opens up the album with 
a bang (and some cow-bell), as MCA 
chants that they’re “gonna party for 
the motherfucking right to fight!” 

Their guests join in on the spir-
ited, DGAF attitude. Nas is at his top 
form in MC battle royal “Too Many 
Rappers,” while Santigold plays it cool 
on reggae summer jam “Don’t Play 
No Game That I Can’t Win.”  

But the best part about the 
Beasties, made gloriously evident on 
Hot Sauce, is that they just don’t care. 
Hip-hop trends elude them — their 
innovation comes from the fact that 
they are trying to one-up each other 
and, of course, themselves — mak-
ing them sound a helluva lot fresher 
than any “sucka MCs” who have yet to 
reach middle-age. 

So when Ad-Rock spits “I’m about 
the best and if you diss then that’s 
wrong,” on “Make Some Noise,” there’s 
no reason not to believe him.

Middle-Aged B-Boys  
Balance Brews With 
Dope-Ass Beats

T he inevitable has happened: rapper-turned-actor Ice-T and his bodacious wife, Coco (aka Nicole 
Natalie Austin), have landed a reality 
show deal with E! that’s set to premiere 

June 12. The show will follow Coco 
and T’s unconventional relationship 
(seriously, though, who pairs tea and 
cocoa?), and, as the surely hope, bring 
the pair to the national spotlight.

Honestly, it’s almost surprising that 
it’s taken this long for a network to 
snap this idea up (T’s schedule bust-
ing heads at NBC’s “Law and Order: 
Special Victims Unit” must be par-
ticularly taxing), though the two are 
the perfect match for the reality show 
grind. 

It’s “Keeping Up with the 
Kardashians” tits and ass (Coco) rolled 
into “Hogan Knows Best”-esque gruff 
grit (Ice-T) dashed with the same “The 
Simple Life” absurdity that will keep 
us wondering how our protagonists 
have managed to stay out of jail — or 
upright (Ice-T and Coco’s tits, respec-
tively.)

Add in the fun that the producers 
must have had devising a moniker for 
this primetime gem — T with a side 
of Coco?, Some T in your Coco?, Iced 
Coco? (The drink combinations are 
endless) — and you have a real ratings 
ball-buster (they decided to call it “Ice 
Loves Coco,” which is a little low on 
the kitsch scale for true E!-tards).

But with such an overabundance 
of reality on television today, it’s 
hard to pinpoint what niche the new 
chocolate Ice-love will fill.  Bravo’s got 
everything from weeping brides to 
top chefs, E!’s made millions making 
the untalented and unemployed rich, 
and for a little mid-week pick-me-up, 
viewers can turn to MTV’s  plethora 
of sob-stories — “16 and Pregnant,” 
“Teen Mom” or “True Life.”

But screw the naysayers. The show’s 
going to be a smash, due in large part 
to the cultural image the duo has 
pioneered — Ice-T (despite his outra-
geous “eat a bowl of dicks” commen-
tary) is still one of the grandfathers 
of hip-hop, a genre that’s only further 
exploded this year; Kanye West’s lat-
est album topped most critics’ top 10 
lists last year, and Coachella’s lineup 
featured more rappers than ever (Nas, 
Odd Future, Wiz Khalifa and Tinie 
Tempah, to name a few).  

Plus, model/“Playboy” alum Coco 
is the original curvy boss bitch that’s 
started to flood the mainstream in 
recent months. Nicki Minaj could 
be her niece, and Wiz Khalifa’s beau 
Amber Rose is a Coco in training. 
After all, you gotta have a heap of 
swag if you’re hanging with OG Ice-T, 
and a heap of ass to back that swag. 
Coco comes stacked, conveniently, 
with both.

It’s a match made in primetime 
heaven.

So, while some are dooming the 
new endeavor to poor ratings and a 
floundering first season, T and Coco 
represent what the masses (well, 
maybe just me) have come to want 
most in a basic cable man-and-wife 
union: a washed-up legend and his 
bodacious better half.

 I’ll drink to that.

I f you want brains, “Fast Five” — the latest installment in the “Fast and Furious” series — isn’t for you. As expected, the flick is set 
on mouth-gaping action, though with a fun 
heist premise and a colorful setting, it proves to 

be a gripping addition to the 
franchise. 

The movie begins where 
the fourth installment, “Fast 
& Furious,” ended and before 
“The Fast and Furious: 
Tokyo Drift” begins, with the 
street-racing crew coming 

together for “one last job” (of course, with a 
sequel already in the works, it’s obviously not). 

We’re still following the fast and furious 
drivers we met 10 years ago — Brian O’Conner 
(Paul Walker), Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) 
and Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) — along 
with some newbies from the more recent 
installments (Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris 

reprise their roles from “2 Fast 2 Furious”; Sung 
Kang from “Tokyo Drift” is featured as well). 

This movie gets down to basics: money, 
violence and cars. They’re going to steal every 
cent that belongs to Rio de Janeiro’s highest-
ranking crime boss, thereby ensuring some 
kind of peace for the Brazilians (maybe) and 
getting revenge for this or that personal injus-
tice. Though the crime has gone from stealing 
cars to stealing money, don’t expect “Ocean’s 
14”: These criminals live by the motto of “go 
big or go home,” and they don’t plan on going 
home anytime soon. 

Brian, Mia and Dom also have to escape 
some pesky law enforcement (cue a really use-
less performance by The Rock as a DSS agent). 
This is where the moral message of the story 
gets a little skewed. (Yes, it’s hard to believe, but 
there is a moral here — or there was, at some 
point.) Dom wants to buy their freedom in 
the first half of the film, but in the second, he 

stresses that they can’t run just away from what 
they started. The blindingly bright cross grac-
ing his neck doesn’t seem to give him clarity, 
but it does remind us that, gosh darn it, he’s a 
good Catholic boy through and through. 

The lines of morality blur a little here, but 
the audience can judge for themselves whether 
these are good people with bad impulses or 
criminals to the core. And in typical “Fast and 
Furious” style, the movie’s riddled with crazy 
awesome car chases and races, often with cre-
ations that you’re not entirely sure fall under 
the category of “car.” (Special effects sure have 
come a long way since the franchise’s 2001 
debut.) 

“Fast Five” boasts all the strengths that have 
allowed the series to endure the past decade 
— and as long as you’re not expecting depth 
of plot and serious character development, the 
explosions have more than enough testosterone 
to keep your blood thumping.

ALBUMREVIEW

O ne of last year’s most critically overlooked records was Mare, a collection of world-lean-ing pop music recorded by Michigan-based 
ethnomusicologist Julian Lynch. Though that 
record is often unassuming (wispy, cyclical guitar 
lines and barely-there vocal melodies), it possesses 
a degree of warmth and amiability rare in contem-
porary indie rock. 

Follow-up Terra certainly retains that lived-in, 
old sweater comfort, but also finds Lynch exploring 
increasingly wider instrumental ground in a way 
that’s both developed and ambitious.

By about 45 seconds into the title track, it’s clear 
that Lynch has learned a lot since Mare. Though 
the song opens with an common, though gorgeous, 
saxophone solo, it blossoms to reveal ambling eth-
nic percussion and Byrds-style jangle guitar. The 
Eastern atmospherics and psychedelic backdrop 
are still present, but the final product consistently 
sounds more like Fleetwood Mac than a Sublime 
Frequencies release. 

While none of the other compositions on the 
album are quite as pop-minded as “Terra,” they still 
possess a sense of focused lucidity that sets Terra 
apart from the rest of Lynch’s oeuvre. The piano riff 
on “Fort Collins,” for example, sounds as though 
it could have been pulled from a lost mid-decade 
Coldplay single. 

Also outstanding is closing track “Back.” With 
winsome acoustic strumming and the kind of gen-
tle melody that sounds tailor-made for warm, lazy 
evenings, the track seems destined for “Summer 
‘11” mixtape glory. 

Like Mare before it, Terra has its share of 
jammy, psychedelic atmospheric tunes — but 
Lynch has also clearly begun to transcend the circle 
of hazy East Coast artists with whom he got his 
start, crafting catchy, pop-minded, yet relentlessly 
innovative folk music.

this better than most. In effect, I have 
gone without a bench press for several 
months (yes, I am crying inside), but 
the lift and added muscle in my chest 
would actually inhibit my ability to 
throw. 

I am in no way condoning the use 
of banned supplements. I am merely 
stating the fact that the morality of 
equality behind the bans is question-
able, and actually making the athletes 
stop looking for that edge is improb-
able.

In Chambers, who competed last 
weekend at the Triton Invite, we find 
that rather than being weakened as 

a result of the ban from Athletics, 
he instead set the European 60-meter 
dash record free of steroids in 2009. 
His genes are just better for running 
than mine. Period. I will never be 
that fast, no matter how many drugs I 
take and how sterile I become. On the 
other hand, steroids would make a one 
one-hundredth of a second of a differ-
ence for him and give him the edge he 
needed.

One part of me wants to see the 
pinnacle of human innovation and 
skill, the balance of drugs and training 
combined in every aspect of making 
us better as a species out there on the 
field. How incredible it would be to see 

an eight-second 100-meter dash, a 700-
foot home run, or a dunk from outside 
the NBA three-point line.

The other part of me loves the 
simple man, with no added benefits, 
just being genuinely better than every-
one else.

The latter part always wins out. I 
want to work harder than everyone 
else, and if they beat, me, I assume they 
are better than me and I need to work 
harder to beat them. If I win like that, 
I know it is me winning, not science. 
I would rather be better than every 
competitor naturally than know my life 
and work was a lie, or could be claimed 
more rightfully by someone else.

ry. Elliott and West won their doubles 
match in thrilling fashion 9-8, while 
Armaun Emami and Jiganti pulled 
out a victory 8-6. In the singles, 
Chapman Chan came back to win 
0-6, 6-3, 6-4, while West and Jiganti 
added victories to seal the match 6-4, 
7-6 and 6-1, 6-0, respectively.  Top 
singles player and senior Erik Elliott 
lost 6-3, 7-5 for the first time in sev-
eral weeks.

In the season finale, the Tritons 
captured the perfect season by easily 
defeating Sonoma State University 
8-1. The Tritons swept the doubles 
matches, as Elliott and West won 9-7, 
Chan and Jason Wall won 8-6 and 
Emami and Jiganti cruised 8-2.

In the singles matches, Elliott won 
6-3, 6-3 to finish the season 18-3 
from the No. 1 singles spot. Elliott’s 
win was followed by victories from 
Chan, Sam Ling, Jiganti and Jake 
Fellow.

“I am really happy and proud 
of the guys,” head coach Erik 
Steidlmayer said. “We had a ton of 
close matches and to win them all is 

truly remarkable. It was absolutely a 
team effort all season long and we’re 
excited for the next step.”

The team finished 20-0, ranked 
No. 10 in the country and first in 
the NCAA West Region. The Tritons 
now have the NCAA Championship 
Finals May 11 to 14 in Altamonte 
Springs, Fla. UCSD received a bye 
in regionals and advances directly 
to nationals. The Tritons will face 
the team that comes out of the sec-
ond Southeast Regional site. It will 
be the Tritons’ first appearance in 
the championships since 2007, when 
they lost 5-1 to Valdosta State in the 
semifinals.

On the women’s side, the Tritons 
finished up their season with a loss 
against Concordia Irvine and a vic-
tory over Sonoma State, and did not 
receive a bid to the NCAA West 
Regionals. 

The Tritons fell to Concordia 
Irvine 7-2, with the lone bright spot 
coming from Samantha Yeung, who 
won her singles match in a super 
tie-breaker 6-7, 6-4, 10-1.  Yeung also 
won her doubles match with Roxanna 

Pourmirzaie 8-5 to give UCSD their 
two victories of the day.

In the season finale, the team 
cruised to a 7-2 victory over Sonoma 
State. Cindy Dao, Haley Perrotte, 
Yeung and Jacquelyn Davis provided 
the singles victories, with Davis win-
ning 6-0, 6-0, and Perrotte gaining 
the victory by winning an exciting tie-
breaker 6-1, 6-7, 10-6.  The Tritons 
swept the doubles side with victo-
ries from Taskeen Bains and Perrotte, 
Dao and Davis and Pourmirzaie and 
Yeung.

These were senior Dao’s last regu-
lar season matches, and she won her 
singles match easily 6-1, 6-0 and her 
doubles match with Davis 8-6.

The Triton women finished the 
season ranked No. 17 and with a 
record of 10-8. The team was ranked 
fourth in the West Region, and only 
the top three were selected to com-
pete in regional championships and 
the opportunity of advancing to the 
national championships.

ten serious about the team. Johnson has already gathered $10 million  
in donations from local businesses to show support, billboards have 
gone up and regional authorities have begun drafting plans to build a 
new arena to be funded by the region. 

Comparisons have been drawn between the situation in 
Sacramento and the departure of the Supersonics a few years back. A 
big fuss was made in both cases, but the difference is that Seattle still 
has the Mariners and the Seahawks. Seattle is still consistently ranked 
amongst the most livable cities in the country, while Sacramento 
has already lost its WNBA team two seasons prior, is hemorrhaging 
jobs and probably has one of the most unfortunate nicknames ever: 
“Sac-town.”

The Kings won’t be a .500 team next season and, with no prospects 
in the upcoming draft, may not even have hope for improvement. But 
it seems now that Kings fans have begun to realize that if the team is 
going to stay, it will need to be by their pocket.  

No matter how much we may try to deny it, the team is a part 
of Sacramento, and Sacramento without the Kings would not be the 
same.

When should you cheat? The immediate answer is  “never.” This is especially the case if your mom or teacher is in 
the room, but cutting corners can be deadly in 
any situation: When you cheat, you are not who 
you say you have worked to be. When people 
find out, they question you, the school you went 
to and the teachers that taught you. Your life can 
become a lie.

In sports, we have seen this all over the 
board. Jose Conseco laid all the gory details out 
in a book. Mark McGwire looks as if he’ll never 
get into the Hall of Fame despite his homeruns. 
Marion Jones was stripped of five Olympic 
medals. Barry Bonds was indicted for perjury. 
BALCO ruined many lives and tore down many 
a childhood poster.

These people cheated and their lives became 
lies to not only themselves, but to millions 
everywhere. Their coaches are humiliated, their 
families ashamed and their reputations are more 
shot than Mrs. Robinson’s.

So the big question, if you should never 
cheat, is why these athletes choose to cheat. For 
example, English sprinter Dwain Chambers — 
European Record Holder and Champion in 2002 
— received a two-year ban from athletics and a 
lifetime ban from the Olympics for testing posi-
tive for THG in 2003. 

THG is an anabolic steroid that binds to the 
androgen receptor in cells and changes how gene 
traits are expressed. However, on top of being 
banned, this drug also leads to infertility, adding 
to the mystery of why he would take it in the 
first place.

In his book, “Race Against Me,” Chambers 
says he took THG to get an edge, that one one-
hundredth of a second that can be the difference 
between gold and silver. He estimates that half of 
the athletes at the Beijing Games in 2004 were 
taking banned substances. 

Why? In many cases, the athletes genuinely 
don’t know. They are given a regimen by their 
“nutritionist” and are expected to follow it as 
they follow their training regimen: with exacti-
tude. It’s their job to do so and, by doing so, to 
win. This leads to the next point of sustaining a 
living. Without their wins, the athletes don’t get 
paid. If everyone else is doping and you’re not, 
you are likely to lose.

But how can the world of sports expect ath-
letes to stay away from drugs when the very thing 
every athlete strives for — that little edge over the 
competition that lets you scratch and kick by to 
victory — is so ingrained in their minds?

That restraint is probably supposed to come 
from some sense of morality. The purity of build-
ing strength and skill over time in an individual 
is the only allowable building block for greatness. 
Cheating to get a better base leads to life and suc-
cess being a lie. 

What strikes me, though, is that none of us 
are really equal. 

I said it. When you were young you were 
probably told you could be whatever you want 
to be if you work hard at it. Frankly, that’s a lie. 
Physically, if you are under 5’6”, you will not be 
an NBA player. If you do not produce as much 
testosterone as the next guy, you will not be a 
weightlifting champion. If you are over 6 feet 
tall, you will not fly fighter jets for the USAF. I’m 
sorry if I burst your bubble.

If no one is equal, why not allow there to be 
a leveling of the playing field? Why not let those 
that those who work hardest and have the best 
technology get the greatest gains? Pure strength 
is an attribute, but there is a limit to how much 
that strength will help you swing a baseball bat 
or shoot a basketball. Skill is still a valuable asset 
that, in most cases, cannot be beaten by add-
ing more muscle. As a javelin thrower, I know

PERFECTION & DISAPPOINTMENT

UCSD men’s tennis 
finishes the regular season 

undefeated, while the 
women’s team just misses 

the postseason.

The UCSD men’s tennis team completed a perfect regular season on Saturday, taking down three opponents in a 
busy week to finish an unblemished 20-0. 
Playing in the Sonoma State Invitational, 
the No. 10 Tritons defeated Hawaii Hilo and 
Grand Canyon by the narrow margin of 5-4, 
but then finished the season with a strong 8-1 
defeat of Sonoma State.

On Thursday, the Tritons took on Hawaii 
Hilo, and after losing two of three doubles 

matches, seniors Erik Elliott and Vincent 
Nguyen led the way in the comeback victory.  
Elliott won the No. 1 singles match 6-2, 6-3, 
while Nguyen won 6-2, 3-6, 6-4. Austin West 
(6-3, 6-0) and Max Jiganti (6-2,6-1) also won 
their singles matches to clinch the match for 
the Tritons.

On Friday against Grand Canyon, the 
Tritons once again pulled out a narrow victo-

Anti-Royal Sentiment in California’s Capital
It’s been an interesting few weeks for the 24-58 Sacramento Kings. The team has been on the brink of a move to Anaheim 
for the past few years — from Chris Webber 
shedding tears on TNT to rumors about a 
potential buyout from a mysterious billion-
aire who is friends with Bill Clinton. But for 
those of you who haven’t been keeping up 
(and here in Lakers territory, I’m assuming 
that’s the majority), here’s a breakdown of 
the situation in the capital city, and why you 
should care.

The Maloof family, the owners of the 

team for the past 10 years, has been toying 
with the idea of a move since its bid for the 
construction of a new arena was blocked by 
the city a few years back. NBA commissioner 
David Stern backed the new arena in its early 

stages — when the Kings were still over .500 
— but has since dropped support for both 
the arena and for Sacramento.  

When the Maloofs began negotia-
tions with officials in Anaheim, the city of 
Sacramento galvanized in 11th-hour des-
peration. Grassroots efforts to fill the stands 
cropped up, while the mayor, a three-time 
NBA All-Star, spearheaded the effort to keep 
the Kings.   

Now, the league’s deadline to announce 
plans to move has come and passed, and it 
looks like the Kings will stay in Sacramento 
for at least one more season.  

Considering falling attendance numbers, 
the team’s abysmal performance in the past 
few years and the difficulties of the small-
market franchise, it really is doubtful that 
the team can turn itself around in one year’s 
time. Pundits agree. Lakers fans and Golden 
State fans alike, agree.  I would agree too, 
if I didn’t know first-hand the love affair 
between the team and the city.

More than any NBA franchise, the 
Sacramento Kings are an embodiment of 
their city.  In the Chris Webber era when Phil 

Jackson called Sacramento a “cow-town,” 
Sacramentans rallied and cowbells were 
handed out at the front door. The cosmo-
politan roster — replete with a center from 
Serbia and a shooting guard from Turkey 
— personified a city known as one of the 
most ethnically diverse in the country. Arco 
Arena, criticized by David Stern for being 
the oldest and smallest arena in the league, 
is to most natives intimate and full of char-
acter — a venue where you’re just as likely 
to see your next-door neighbor as you are 
your high school history teacher. In the same 
vein, unfortunately, it may be that the flight 
of a failing club is the result of the decay 
of the state’s capital amidst the economic 
downturn. 

The last Kings game I attended, I paid $15 
to sit in the upper level and, because the seats
