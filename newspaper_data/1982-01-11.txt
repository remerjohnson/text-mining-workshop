Whatpver mav come of 
President Reag"an's arms 
control proposals in the 
Geneva negot ia t ions O\'er the 
coming weeks, th(' short 
history of nuclear a r ms 
limitation talks has taught us 
one clear les.on: Head li ne· 
grabbing proposals, such as 
Reagan'<.; (or Carter's initial 
. ALT If initiati\e) have little 
to do wllh the ult imate succes<.; 
or failure of the arms cont rol 
proces .. 

What is far more i->ignificant 
to the long-t rm pro peets for 
arms control IS how the 
negotiators relate to a seriei-> of 
hard ·line myths about Soviet 
intention" -and capabi lities 
wh ich ha\e helped propel the 
arms race forward in recen t 
v ar<;. Until th grip of th ese 
mvt hs on t he American psvche 
IS reduced. meaningful arms 
cont rol IS not Iikelv to be 
reached. What are these 
mvths. and in "hat "'en<;e are 
1 he\ \\ rong? 

-You cannot trust the 
/)\ iet ["nion to honor treaties 
In fact. the eAperienLe with 

:ALT I suggests the opposite. 
SO\'iet \ lolat ion~ \\ ere minor 
and did not exceed liS 
\ iolation~. :Yloreover, those 

bilatera l \'Io lations were 
smoothed over a nd worked out 
through negotlat ions. 

-The Soviets engaged in a 
huge mllitar~ bu ild·up during 
the 1970s, taki ng ad\'antage of 
the 'ALT process to overtake 
us. 

Whatever the {)viets did, 
they \ iolated no treat \. or 
formal understa nding -with 
the Uni ted tates. More 
Important ly,th ydidnotdoall 
that much. They kept up their 
pre\lou.., pace of incrementa l 
defense budget ing at a ti me 
when th Umted States \\as 
reclucmg its previous pace. 
This reduced the relat ive gap 
in ~trategiccapabil i t y between 
Ih(' two superpowers, 
<,tlmulati ng l' fears that its 
prevlOuc; margin of superiori ty 
had disappeared. Indeed it had. 
but that i not the. am as 
saying that the oviets now 
enJOY strategic superiority. 
(The'. do not.) We seem to 
forget that many things 
undertaken bv the Soviets 
dUring the 1970s, such as 
modernii'a tion of 'itrategic 
force",. also were undertak n 
b\ Ihe lnited States and 
:-JATO. We also forget that we 
far {'xCl'eded the Soviet-. In 
numbers of warhead~ 
depl()~ed dunng the 1970s. 

The Soviets did bui ld up their 
... trategir forces during the 
1 970s, and thev did reduce the 
gap, but not - nearly to the 
extent implied by this hard-
line myth. 

, -The SO\' lets be li e\' 
nuclear war can be fought and

The fallacies of 'peace through strength' 
Editor: 

An edi tor ial r c ntly publi shed in the Guardial/ 
(" Ret hinking ou r nuclear s tra tegy in Europe" 11112) 
attempted to justify the current policy of escalating 
the nuclear arms build -up. Whi le the given 
arguments appear to be well reasoned , they proceed 
from fa ulty premises. 

The first misconception concerns the importance 
of treat ies. A t reaty is fi rst and foremosl a statement 
of intent ion . While the par ties involved may have 
di fferent reasons for enter ing into th agreem nt . by 
signing a trea ty they acknow ledge a common 
interest and express the hope of mutua l benefi t. 
Ensuring the survival of huma ni ty shou ld be 
incentive enough to ratify (a nd follow) trea ties 
(beginning with SALT II ) limiting the productIOn 
and use uf nuclear weapons. 

Ilowe\er noble the intentions of the treaty, they 
must be subject to verification if they are to carry 
a ny weigh t. Given the Increasingly sophisticat d 
techn ology avat lable for the d tection of weapons 
''It S, and the inclu'iion of provisions allowing 

in~p ctions of sites by international bodies in stich a 
treaty, it should be IX)ssible to \' rifyadh rence to a 
treaty. 

The second argument rI'als \\'Ith the SlIppO ... d 
Soviet threat to Western Europe. and b) 
Implicat lon, to the I 'nll('d Statb. Although douiJt" 
may exist a-; the to bl'n('voienc{'of SO\letlnt('ntlOn:. 
an ('ffort mu<;t be rmld(' 10 lIndrr"'tand the SO\ il't 

viewpoin t and to recognize that they al so tear 
attack. Remembering that NATO (1949) was 
organized before the Warsaw Pact (1955); th at 
America n bases dot Europe and the Mediterranean , 
faci ng the Soviet Union wi th hostile weapons while 
th re are none near American terri tory; th at the 
Uni ted States has generally been the firs t to 
introduce new weapons (the H·bomb, ICBM 's, 
mu lt iple wa rhead missiles, the MX mi ssile and the 
neut ron bomb): th a t th e Soviet government 
cunt inued to sugges t a rms li mitation treat ies tha t 
are rejected by the Un ited States, it is not surprising 
I hat the Sov iets view their posture as defens ive. 
Rece nt pronouncements from Washington on the 
f as ibilit y of a "lim it ed nuclear exchangc" and the 
possibili ty of deploy ing a "demonstra tion" nuclear 
weapons enhance fears of America n aggr ssion. 

Even assuming (as do Mr. Payn and Mr. 
Wa rbur ton) that there wi ll b' a convent ional war 
between AT O and Warsaw pact forces, their 
contention tha t NATO has fo rces to mai nt ain 
combat for on ly :30 days IS undocumented, and 
Soviet '>uperiortty in s tandi ng armies and material 
such as tanks, is offset by the Am 'riran advantage 
in aircraft. anti ·tank weapons and air SUPIXlrt 
mate'nal such a~ aircraft carriers. 

SInn' they reject tl1(' Idea of expanding 
('ol1\('niIOnal forn's as too ('o ... th .• In' \\'t' th(,11 10 

IIIl(kr~I;tnd th;\I nll('I('ill' \\('apons iln' rll'I'I'llI,lhll' 

subs titutes? It is interest ing thal lIow nere do they 
see fit to mention the characteri stic that separates 
nuclear weapons from conventional arms: their 
immense, uncontrollable destructive power. It may 
indeed be t rue that " the main ad va ntage of nuclear 
wea pons is their relati ve cheapness per unit 
firepower," but this fact pales in importance before 
the ca pacity of nuclea r weapons to quickl y and 
effectively annihil ate the human race. 

To prevent such a holocaust, it is imperati ve that 
we ha lt and reve rse the trend towa rd s yet more 
sophi st ica ted a nd deadl y weapons. If we consider 
"nuclear parit y" to be th capa bilit y for mu tual 
destruction, then nuclea r parity already is a fact. 
While it would be u topi an to suggest that the 
oppob ing sides would be willing to immediately 
des troy th eir nuclea r arsena l ~, it is possi ble to stop 
the produ ction of n w weapons and th e one 
upma nship that currentl y ex is ts. The policy of 
"peace Ihrough s trength " onl y ex pl oit s th e

each side to increase it s arsenal to ensure, in its own 
mind, its invulnerabilit y. Veri fiable parit y (of both

Anti-nuke intiative gets California support 
cllnti nll ed from pa ge 2 
a round us ca lled nuclear 
arm s , s aid in it i ative 
organizer Harold Willens , a 
promi ne n t Los A nge les 
e n t repre ne ur who ra Hied 
fellow busines men against 
U policy in Vietnam . In 
addit ion to the proce of 
c o ll e c ti n g s ig n atu r e s, 
" respected scientis ts will be 
able to communicate to t he 
people and the press the 
aw ome rea lity of nuclear 
weapons." 

We' re not sure how much 
useful public di scu ion is 
likely to ari e from a nuclear 
free7e initia ti ve in California, 
where ma ny modern missile 
systems are manu factured . 
Orga ni zers mU Si con vince 
:350,000 Californi ans to sign 

petit ions by April 27 if they're 
to qualify the referendum for 
the November ballot. And 
th ere's not much new that Bill 
Zi mmerman ca n sa y t hat 
hasn 't already been said or 
written . And yet, the former 
media co n u l tant to t he 
Ci t izen's Party has been hi red 
by campaign organizers to 
produce a series of television 
ad verti se m e n t s o n t he 
initiati ve. 

What does emerge, though, 
is a ·trong sense of despai r 
among Americans who'd like 
to quell the arms race but don't 
see any way out of the current 
ma dn ess. Th e ini t iat ive 
method, though democrat ic, 
probabl y won 't reverse a 
policy that 's been th riving fo r 

:JO years. The futi li ty of the 
effort ironicall y mi rrors the 
helplessness of people who are 
trying to ta ke more control of 
their dest inies. 

Ronald Reaga n may not 
sen. e it , but what 's happening 
here is the same mi xture of 
helplessne s th a t has led 
hundreds of th ousand s of 
Western Europeans, you ng 
and old, to paint their faces 
a nd take to the s t r~e t s over the 
la ' l several months. Whi le 
Reaga n may s u ~pe('t .00'let 
strings attached to their 
machinations, the~e protest· 
ers have also decided that 
doing so met hing is bet ter than 
doi ng nothi ng. 

" I t 's been such a great 
psychologica l re l('ase for 

peop le to \\ ork on the 
Initiative." noted Jo Scidita, 
a nother Ini t iative coordinator. 
(Her husba nd , Nick, drew the 
idea fo r the initiative from a 
six-paragraph magazine 
art icle on t he Massachu. etts' 
effort.) 0;1 can't tell you how 
upbeat people are now that 
they ha ve somet h i ng to do. It's 
so therapeutic." 

im ilar initiatives are in the 
embroyonic stage tn Michigan. 
Missouri and Washington. St 
Loui.., now boa-;Is the national 
headquarter ... of "The 
Campaign for a l\uL'lear 
Weapon Freeze," of \\hich 
local init iati\'es and educat ion· 
all effort s t h roughou t the 
country are bClIlg coordlOated. 

Though organizers here in 

California acknowledge that a 
majority of Americans favor a 
st ronger national defen e, 
they want the L' to engage in 
,>erious arms negotiations 
with the Soviet Union. They 
believe that an overwhelming 
rejection of nuclear weapon ' 
by Calt fornlans could ignite a 
national trend. 

"We want to use the nuclear 
freeze initiati\'e a-; a litmus 
test for all politician'>," added 
Jo eldlta. "We want it to be 
t he one I ...... ue that e\ en public 
offlcseeker is judged upon" 

For \\ hat It'" worth, Mr. 
Pre ... ident the ... e people don't

initiati\·e. In ... tead, they 'd lik(-

levels of damage. Though the 
phra seo logy is d iffere n t, 
S 0 \ . i e t c 0 n c e p t io n s 0 f 
deterrence are not all tha t 
different from MAD. 

- The Soviets will onl y 
negoti ate seriously from a 
position of potential infer ior-
ity; we need to deve lop 
barga ining chips that wi ll 
induce them to ~ober up. 

Th i ~ claim ha~ a surface 
plausibi lity to it. for we know 
that o\'iet motivation for 
serious negotiati ng duri ng 

ALT I \ ... as stro n g l y 
in flu enced by their fea r of { .S. 
MIRV, Trident submarine a nd 

ABM program s. Bu t the 
conclu ion is misplaced. MIRV 
and Trident were not headed 
off by AL T I , yet t he Soviets 
n o ne th e le s n ego t ia t ed 
seri ously. ABM was preceived 
to be in the mu tual interest of 
both coun tries to res tra in . 

Then there i the problem of 
t he fate of bargaining chips. 
Once developed, it i rare that 
t hey are bargained away. Are 
we really creating ba rgaining 
chip~. or just creating another 
spira l in the arms race? 
Finall y, Ihe real issue is 
whet her we wi ll set tle for 
parity, or are actua ll y seeking 
to res tore t he old margi n of 

s trategic superiority. The six 
myt hs out li ned here suggest a 
state of mind t hat seeks 
superiori t y a nd fears parity. If 
t hose are t he term. we 
effec tively place before the 
Soviets, it is not likely that 
they wi ll be eager to negotiate. 

- If we do not build up our 
st rategic forces, the So\'iets 
will use their strategic 
superiority to face us down in 
Third World crises . 

ThiS claim is my~tifying and 
illogical. but must be taken

1onday, J anuary ' 11, 1982 The UCSD Guardia n 

UCSD ranked 13th in nation 
By ERIC YOUNG 

UCSD is the 13th best uni · 
\'er ity in the nation for under· 
graduate studies. according to 
the 1980-81 Gourman Report. 

The report . under the 
direction of Professor Jack 
Gourman of California State 
Northridge, is a rating of 
undergraduate programs in 
American and international 
universities based upon the 
quality of education . 

Criteria for evaluation and 
ranking include faculty 

effectiveness, administrative 
'lrengt h, quality of curricu· 
lum, libraries. public 
relations, and faculty 
researc h. 

Of the 98 disciplines taken 
into account, UCSD received 
notably high marks for 
programs in biology , bio· 
chemistry, molecular biology, 
ce ll biology, chemistry. 
physics, mathematics. 
computer science, philosophy, 
linguistics, English , Spanish, 

urban st udie, , and com para· 
tive literature. It rankcd tenth 
best for premedical education. 

Also scoring high in the 
Gourman Rcport were C 
Berkeley (#6) and UCLA (#10)_ 
These school s, says Gourman. 
hayt' good departm nts and 
have been s u cccs~f ul in 
drawing g o o d f ac ult y 
mem bers uver t he pas t few 
years. He s ingled out UCSD 
for commendat ion , describll1g 
it as "a school on the move."

Grey \Vhales off coast 

BY THOMAS URBACH 
Science Ed ilor 

San Diego's original tourist is back . 
Esc/erichtius rohustlls (or the 
Ca li fo rn ia gray whale to their 
friends), can be observed here in San 
Diego as they take part in the longest 
migration of any mammal. Each year 
they wim from their feeding grounds 
in the Bering ea to the warm lagoon 
of Baja California: an average of 6,000 
mile each way. 

The California gray is a midsized 
whale of the bal en type. While their 
toothed cousins ea t fi sh and squid, the 
gray and other baleen whales subsist 
on macroplankton , a broad class of 
tiny sea animals such as euphausiids, 
!-. hrimp, and sea butterflies . The gra y 
whales eat mostl y bent hic amphipods 
which li ve on the ocean floor. They 
feed by churning up the ocean bottom 
and after taking a mouthful of this 
sludge. they force the water back out 
through the baleen which traps the 
food. Whales may consume tons of 
food each day 10 this manner. 

Though the point i debated. it 
seem. that once the whales lea\'C the 
feed ing grounds they do not eat again 
until they return eight months later. 

The gray whal s are not large by 
wha le standards, reaching a 
maximum length of 50 feet and an 
estimated weIght of 10 tons. Blue 
\\ ha les. hy comparison. can attain 
lengt hs of 100 feet and weigh 150 tons. 

The gray whales leave the Bering 
Sea in three distinct groups. Pregnant 
females begin leaving in September so 
they can reach the Mex ican lagoons in 
time to calve. Males and females who 
are ready to breed leaave next and are 
followed by the adolescents and older 

whales. T he journey south takes 
about three months and mo t whales 
are in the Baja lagoons by February. 

Swimming in groups of two to six, 
the whales cover bet ween 85 and 100 
miles a day on their journey. They 
often come qui te close to hore and 
adolescent have even been observed 
frolicking in the su rf. Exact il y how 
the whales na \'igate is not known . [t is 
believed that baleen whales do not 
have the highly developed sonar 
apparat us found in the toothed 
whales, and although some speculate 
that the grays get their bearings from 
features of the ocean bottom, their 
navigation is st ill basica ll y a mystery. 

As the whales swim along. ther 
breathe and di ve in a rhythmic cycle. 
After swimming under water for fi\e 
or six minute , a whale will surface to 
breathe, resubmerge for around 15 
seconds , then surface again. After 
three or four of these breaths, it v. ill 
dive and swim underwater for 
another five minutes, ~urfacing to 
repeat the breathing cycle. In this 
swimming pattern only the "pout and 
back arc \·isible. and t his is often as 
much as people l'\er see of the \\'hal 
As a whale S\\'lm" along, its thru"ting 
tail cau~es hOlI" on the \\ ater' . 
surface. A suhmerged whale can be

Grey whale mig .... ltion route ... 

Women in science group active at UCSD 
BY LESLIE A. FOOTE 

Bridging the gap between students 
and facu lt y. and bringing women 
toget her to discuss problems related 
to a science career is what the 
"Women in Science" organii'ation has 
"et out to accomplish. E,er ... ince the 
format IOn of the organii' a t ion in 
February 1981 , women researcher~. 
doctors. technician~ and many others 
have been invited to share their 
thoughts with the women in science 
on campus. It is worth noting lhat ·19 
percent of the st udent populat ion at 
LIC D is in the Sciences: of these 
·tudents, 34 percent are women -
and these women make up on ly 17 
percent of th e tota l s t udent 
populal ion. 

Unlike their male counterparts. 
women who pursue the sciences face a 
number of personal deci sions b cause 
of t he "non-traditional" role t hey play. 
It is for thi s reason that Women in 

SCIence was founded . [t was felt that 
presenting panels would prcl\'ide an 
opportunity for women to meet and 
give eac other ~UPP()rt. The panels 
offer a chance for women to come and 
"see other women coping with the 
same problem'>." a~ one member 
s tated. 

ue D's high sCIence major 
population and the re:ulting attrition 
rate betray the compet iti ve 
atmosphere that preva ils here. [n 
such an environment it is not 
uncommon that women. who are 
purs uing nOIl -lraditional subjects, 
may begin to question their 
femininity. There is the feeling that 
one must compensate for being fema le 
in order to ucceed. Certainly the 
opportunities available are becoming 
more and more equivalent between 
the sexes, but this does not alleviate 
the unea y feelings and the insecurit y 
created by pursuing scientific careers . 

Howe\·er. t he problem» that the 
Women in • cience organizat IOn deab 
with arc not unique to women. As a 
member "tated, "i ... sues that face 
women. facc men ." !\lan\' women feel 
insecure or unsure al~lUt start Ing 
families . for example, if they intend to 
pursue a career as well . Ver\ fe\\ 
people realize ho\\ slgmftcant ' thest' 
issues are to (,1'1'1)'0l1e. 

The pan Is offer a direct means of 
finding out about career,., a\'atlable 
and estab li shing contacts . :\nn ' 
academic ca reers are also discu",sed. 
The organi/<ltion hoped, e\'enluall~' , 
to set up a "net work" whereby 
st udent s ca n direct l\' contact outSIde 
sources that are interested in the 
st udents on campus. Such a net \\'ork 
would encourage women to continue 
in science, and assure them that the\ 
are not "maki ng it on their own ." .

Whales 
('ontinU('d (rom paj.{l' ~) 
pushIng it s nosc straight up 
S(' \ en or eight feet out of I hc 
walcr and holding it th re by 
beating ih tail. This allows it 
10 sec above the waler and may 
also be pan of a courtship 
ritual. A whale will sometimes 
"peek" durng the regular 
swimming pattern by lifting 
its head high enough out of t he 
water to be able to see. 
Occasionally you may see the 
tail (or flukes) sticking out of 
t he water. This is the whale 
winding up to take a d eper 
dive than usual. The most 
dramatic activity is "breech-
ing." The whale will leap 
nearly out of the water and 
land on it" back ur side wit h a 
great splash. The reasons for 
Ihis activity are not clear. and 
";Olll speclJlal e t hat it is a 
d i"'play of power. 

DUl'lng the juurney. th(' 
females who are nol pregnanl 
come into season and bcglll to 
mate. Thi s breeding continues 
into the lagoons of Baja. 
CopulatIOn between two 10ton 
bodie<.; in water is a formidable 
task and usually undertaken 
by two males and a female. 
One male acts as an as , istant 
helping to hold the female In 
position on her ' ide while the 
mating takes place. The 
gestat ion period is thirteen 
months. and whales concieved 
on one trip will b born the 
following year. 

The whales begin arriving 
in the laglXlns along the coast 
of Baja in january. In addition 
to the famous Scammon's 
Lagoon . t here are ca I \' i ng 
grounds at an Ignacio. BahIa 
Magdelena . and some "pot'i

As pregnant females near thcir 
time lhey arejoined by anOlher 
female who acts as a midwife, 
assisting in the birth and if

newborn calf to the surface for

The average calf weighs 
2.000 pounds at birth and 
measures 14 feet. During its 
two months in the lagoon, it 
will gain 50 pounds a day on a 
rich dict of its mother's milk. 
The mother rcsponds to 
nursing efforts with muscular 
contractions which squirt 
milk into th calf's mouth. The 
calf i weaned a ft er about 
seven months. 

The gray whale. usually

The gray whale actually

however, it picks up para ' ites 

such as barnacle and lice. The 
barnacle larvae imbed

Shot sinks but so do 'WOlllen 
Ball falls in a split second after the buzzer, 
Tritons undone by Cal Baptist College, 68-66 

BY JIM SCHUTZ 
Slaff Writer 

Leading by I I points at the 
half. in the consolation ga meof 
the LJCSD Women 's Invita-
I ional Basket ball Tou rna-
ment. the Lady Tritons 
dropped a heartbreaker finish 
to a quick California Baptist 
College team. 68-66, 

With 10 seconds remaining 
in the fourth quarter and Cal 
Bapti t leading by two, guard 
Valerie Hardie received the in-
bound- pass and zig-zagged 
her way between double-
teaming Bapt i ts to the half 
court line where she threw a 
desperate lob in the vicinity of 
freshman tandout Paulette 
Parker. Parker cram bled to 
get the shot off, saw the ball 
float off the backboard and 
through the net only to realize 
that the final buzzer had 

sounded just moments earlier. 
With guards Parker and 

junior Wend y Freed in th 
backcourt. t he Tri tons hosted 
a run-a nd -gun offense that 
totaled 42 points in the first 
half. That offen se. which 
consisted of fast break after 
fast break , and the outside 
hooting of Parker and Freed, 

set up the ball control offense 
by allowing Mary Egan and 
Jean Dangler to roam through 
the key without much 
difficulty. 

The momentum shifted 
early in the third quarter 
because of key substitution 
by Cal Baptist and an injury 
which slowed the high paced 
action to a halt. Head Coach 
Judy Malone, using a three 
guard rotation lat e in the 
game, Iriggered the Triton' 
defense and nearl y pulled her

Spikers cap year 
with presentation 

BY SCOTT ALLISON 
Senior Sia ff Wrher 

La t week was a bi tter weet 
t ime for UCS D wo me n ' 
v,o ll ey ba ll coac h Do u g 
Dannevik. The good news was 
that his squad received a well-
deserved hero's welcome a fter 
recently capt uri ng the NCAA 
Di vi s i on If I crow n i n 
Marysv ille, Tennessee. 

steps on Friday, the NCAA 
cham pionship trophy was 
presented by the tea m to 
Chancellor Ri chard Atki nson, 
who ex pressed delight at the 
team' accompli hments and 
said that he was "coun ti ng on 
them (the Tritons) to improve 
and to have the trophy here 
nex t yea r." 

Volleyball Coach Doug Danne vik (fou rth from le ft), All-American Lulu chwartz (fourth from 
right) and the rest of the champion hip team present Di vis ion III trophy to Chancellor Richard 
Atkins on . 

The bad news was that 
Tammy Smit. the Triton's 
talented young phenomenon 
who at times single-handedly 
carried the 'lfuad when it 
counted, announced to her 
coach that due to personal 
reasons, she will not be 
returning to play volleyball for 
UCSD in 1982. 

Ruggers drop two in tourney 
As the Tri ton atlem pt to 

repeat a ' champions in 1982. 
the lo 's of Smit may hurt more 
than Dannevik cares to admit. 
"Losing Tammy hurts, more 
because we're losi ng a great 
person than be ause we're 
10 ing a great player," said 
Dannevik . ''I'm co nfident 
someone will pick up the slack 
nexl yea r. They did all of thi 
year." 

BY VALERI . ANDER 
ta ll Wriler 

UCSD' Rugby team saw 
tournament action this pa t 
weekend in the first of its pre-
sea on game '. 

Although th team did not 
do as well as it had hoped , with 
losses to SDSU (9·6) and a 

anadian college Simone 
Frazier (10·4), assistant coach 
Peter Semtic feels the team 
will "look pret ty good by the 
end of the season," and "do 
well especially against the 
smaller colleges." 

The Tri tons play In the 
outhern College Division of 

intercollegiate competition. 
the same division that houses 

Cal Poly, Loyola Marymount 
and Oxnard . 

Although there is no 
possibility of post·season play 
for the ruggers, members still 
play to the best of their 
abilities. and team training 
sessIOns are rigorous. 

Approximatel y half of the 
rugby team members are new 
to the squad t his year , many 
playing in key positions . 
Thirty names are current ly 
listed un the team roster, and 
others interested injoiningare 
encouraged to attend team 
practice sessIOns on Muir field.

3:30 p.m. "Everybody gets to

play on thi s team," said 
Semtic. everal of the players 
on the sq uad are rugby 
novice!>, others have high 
school experience. 

Two of the team ' most 
outstanding player are Don 
ElmajJin , and John lam mer. 
Elmajain , Southern California 
all -s tar la st season , was 
praised by Semtic for his 
ability to score. Slammer. a 
pre·med st udent. was noted as 
having excell ent leadership 
qualities. 

Regular league play for 
LIC D's rugby team startsJa'n .

week in April. 

Indeed, it was a special year 
for th sp iker . They 
dominated the NCAA Division 
In from the start, compi ling a 
36·8 overall record and 
defeating Juniata, PA for all 
the marbles just three weeks 
ago. "If there was such a thing 
as a perf eCI season, this was 
iI," said Dannevik. 

In a brief , 20 minute 
ceremony in front of the gym 

Dannevik introduced the 
entire team to the small 
gathering. and one by one they 
stepped forward to greet the 
applause from the crowd.

20 The ( ICSD Guardian Monday. January 11, 1982 

Track practice starts 
Men 's and Women 's track opens its season February 13 with a 

dual meet against Clairemont College. Practice began last week 
but coach Andy kief reveals that the team i . till in need of 
discus and shotput competitors. 

Skief also feels the team will be good in the sprints. weak in the 
hurdle , and excellent in the middle dis tance . 

" We have a lot of carryover from cross-country," he states. 
The 1982 distance sq uad will be led by CC tars Nancy Lee and 

Chris Bowlus. Lee and Bowlus competed in the NCAA regional 
last quarter and earned bearths in the NCAA Div III National 
Championships in Wiscon in. 

Before Lee fini hed second in the Los Angele ' Regional , no 
woman from CSD had ever competed for a National Title. 

"Both Chris and Nancy have a chance to repeat as individual 
champions," kief thinks. 

The experienced coach i also counting on a strong 
performance from decathalon athelete Tim French. 

Tritons Doug Lee. John Beckley and Greg Berry get a flying start in the 100 free las t 
Wednesday against Chico State. UCSD lost to Chico State. 74-38. Over the weekend. the team 
competed in the UC Irvine Invitational. where the men's team finished seventh out of a field of 
16 and second in Division III competition. The women fini s hed first in Division III and 11 th out 
of 18 teams. 

"We have several very talented individuals on the team," the 
coach ob erves, "but out depth is not static enough for a great 
season." 

The coach i till in the market for any interested at heletes.
