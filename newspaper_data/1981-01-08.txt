Anti-draft 
efforts are 
quiet 

Anti-draft groups, leaflet-
ting local post offices since 
the second round of draft 
registration began Monday, 
will continue their efforts to 
discourage potential regi s-
trants through Saturday. 

But according to one 
member of the active San 
Diego Students for Peace, 
protestor have little to do. 

" I tood ou t id e t he 
downtow n post offi ce for two 
hour before the picket on 
Monday and ju t couldn 't 
find anyone to leaflet ," aid 
D P member Jon Bekken. 
And according to an 

informal Guardian poll of 
local po t offices, the number 
of 1962-born American males 
following the Select ive 
Service Sy tern' order to 
register is low. 

Spokesmen at University 
City, Pacific Beach and Del 
Mar post offices reported that 
"about 10" young men a day 
have signed up since 
Monday. 

A representative at the 
downtown San Diego office 
estimates 15 a day come in to 
register, while a La Jolla post 
office clerk places the 
number who register each 
day at that branch at SO. 

Post office officials 
unanimously agreed that 
anti-draft w-oups protesting 
at the buildmg entrances had 
caused no problems. Instead, 
a few clerks complained 
about registrants submitting 
forms under false names 
(Richard Nixon is widely 
used) and generally creating 
a fuss inside the post offices.

Research schools 
meet in La Jolla 

BY JOHN BRICE 
"California would have 

never grown the way it has 
without the University of 
California system, the 
president of the University of 
Pennsylvania said Tuesday. 

Martin Meyerson, speak-
ing at a meeting of US and 
British university leaders at 
UCSD from Jan. 4-6, says the 
reason is that "the research 
university is very important 
in the ,progress of an 
economy. 

Chancellor Richard 

Atkinson also attended the 
meeting, held at Scripps 
Institutk.n ot Oceanography, 
which focused on preserving 
the academic quality of major 
research universities in a 
period of financial con-
straints. 

Although the tone of 
gathering was far from 
optimistic, the university 
leaders did agree that 
research campuses are 
important to the future of 
industry in both nations. 

The university leaders fear 
that budgetary cuts may lead 
to a "decline in academic 
quality." But. according to 
Sir Alec Merrison. vice 
chancellor of the University 
of Bri tol. British universi -
ties are worse off s ince they 
"are more dependent on state 
aid; therefore the economic 
trouble is more acute in our 
system." 

However, the UC sy tern 
also relie heavily on tate 
financing. 

Thoma s A . Bartlett . 
president of the As 'ociation 
of American Uni vers ity . 
which ponsored the event. 
commented that cuts would 
limit the scope of research 
and the growth of librarie . 
"The concern here i that the 
univer ltle will become 
routine." he aid . 

Merrison added that 
private industry will lure 
researcher away with 
salarie. that the universities 
won't be able to match.

Poland and El Salvador: The parallel drawn 
BY RICHARD BARNET 

Pacific New Service 
The Soviet Union, it now 

appears, is prepared to invade 
Polland and kill socialists to 
save socialism from capital· 
ism. Just as ominously, the 
incoming Reagan Admini· 
stration has signaled that it 
will be prepared to intervene 
in EI Salvador and help kill 
freedom fighters to save 
freedom from communism. 

Both superpowers face the 
same ideological crisis. 
Neither seems capable of co-
existing with radical, 
unpredictable change in their 
own backyards. 

The gigantic exercise in 
Soviet military intimidation 

. that has been going on for 
weeks in Poland is not likely 
to work. Lech Walesa and the 
other leaders of the Solidarity 
union movement are 
sophisticated about the need 
for restraint. But they have 
emerged out of a genuinely 
popufar movement and such 
movements are hard to 
control. The weight of the 
past hangs so heavily on 
Poland - repeated Russian 
invasions, purges, privation 
- that popular passion 
constitute a force of their 
own. The more beastly the 
Russians act, the more these 
passions are inflamed. 

The Ru sian almost 
certainly do not want to 
invade Poland. The impact on 
Washington, We tern 
Europe and most Third 
World countries would be 
devastating. At a cri tical 
moment in US · Soviet

affair is the apparent

plummet further. The Soviet 
leaders are still paying the 
cost in 10 s of influence for 
their butchery in Budapest 
and Prague. Not for a long

been so politically i ·olated.

Uranium 235." 

Urey later became 
"appalled," Miller says, by 
the use of nuclear weapons 
and even began to oppose 
nuclear power plants in his 
later years. 

"You know,it'sinteresting 
that he should have had so 
much trouble from leftists 
over that, because when he 
first came to UCSD, the 
right·wing knee·jerk people 
were against him because 
he'd belonged to some leftist 
organization in the 3Os," 
Miller says. 

Urey was involved in 
several anti ·nuclear protest 
organizations in the 50s and 
four years ago came out 
against nuclear power in a 
referendum. 

After the war came his 
"extraordinary" discovery of 
the dating method. Discover-
ed at least partly through 
luck - "not every shells 
works," Miller says_ Urey's 
dating method gave us our 
first oomprehensive know-
ledge of the ice age and ocean 
water temperature patterns. 

Urey also demonstrated his 
versatility by building the 
mass spectrometer that 
allowed him to gel the aging 

process down right. 
"From there, he moved to 

cosmochemistry - that 's the 
study of chemistry in space. 
Most people who studied 
space then were physicists. 
but Urey looked at it and said, 
'There're chemicals there, 
too. When the solar system 
wa formed. there were 
chemicals there, too.' And he 
wanted to know what 
chemicals there were when 
the earth was formed . He 
thought it was a methane 
atmosphere with ammonia, 
and that's what I used when I 
did my experiment that 
proved it," Miller says. 

"He constructed the first 
systematic and detailed 
chronology of the origin of the 
earth and the solar system ... a 
tour de force that will stand 
as one of the classics of 
science," Miller wrote in 
1964. 

Urey also became interest-
ed in moon research, positing 
what most people think now, 
that the moon and the earth 
were originally part of the 
same loosely allied chunk. 

During Urey's experiment-
al works, he always made 
time for his responsibility to 
the university, Miller says. In 
an introduction to a book 

Miller dedicated to Urey on 
the occasion of the chemist's 
70th birthday, Miller notes 
that Urey helped e tablish 
the University of Chicago's 
chemistry department. He 
came to UCSD in 1959 after 
Chicago forced him to retire 
at 65. He helped to shape the 
university, attracting first-
rate scientist "To a place 
that they were really taking a 
chance on , Noone knew whal 
the uiniver ity would be like.-
It could have turned out like 
someother universities in the 
system that were developed 
at the same time." 

Among the scientists 
Miller credits Urey with 
bringing here (besides 
himself) are Joseph and 
Maria Mayer (Maria won a 
Nobel Prize and Joe "was just 
as good as she was: Mayer 
Hall is their namesake), and 
Geoffrey and Margaret 
Burbidge, two of the most 
prominent astrophysicists in 
the world. 

"The Regents were talking 
about making this an 
undergraduate campus , 
which is what we needed to 
make the place good, and 
Urey convinced everyone 
that they would do it," Miller 
says.

Gun nuts fanatical in 
devotion to weapons 
continued from page 3 
received from manufacturers 
on a voluntary basis. 

Mail order sa les are 
technically restricted, under 
the federal Firearms Control 
Act of 1968, to gun dealers. 
But to become a dealer" "the 
primary qualification is to 
have $10 to pay for the 
li ce nse," the Bureau's 
spoke 'ma n said . Among 
.170,000 licen ed dealers are 
many private individuals. 

To buy a gun over the 
counter, federal law requires 
only the filling in of a form 
stating that one is not a felon, 
not mentally ill , does not use 
dangerous drugs. is of legal 
age and reside in the state 
where he is making the 
purchase. These forms are 
not passed on to any federa l 
agency for verification but 
are merely filed with the 
dealer. 

A study conducted by the 
Trea ury Department in 16 
citie . tracing guns u ed in 
crime, found a flow of 
firearms from states with 
weak laws to states with 
strong ones. A major source 
for gun used in New York , 
which ha. one of the tougher 
laws, was outh Carolina. 
That slate has ince 
tightened it. gun law . But 
now Florida is a major 
source. It has lenient laws 
and is also the entry point for 
Saturday night spec ials , 
cheap guns which are 
brought into the country in 
part and assembl ed in 
Florida shops. 

Every 50 minutes. by one 
estimate. omeone in this 
country is killed with a 
handgun. Between 1963 and 
1973. 46,121 America!",s died 
in Vietnam, nearly tWIce that 
many - 84,644 - were killed 
at home with firearms. 

A recent \-ou Harris poll 
conducted for ABC-TV 
showed that 67 percent of 
respondents want some gun 
regulation. Gun control 
advocates have pressed for a 
federal law that would at 
least apply to handguns ~he 
kinds of controls now apphed 
to cars: a license to show 
competence to use, registra-
tion and records that would 
allow tracing from manufac· 
turer to seller. 

The anti -gun control 
groups, however. have been 
such effective lobbyists that 

~ legislation of substance 
has managed to get through 
Congress. or through m~t 
state legislatures . ThIS 
explains , an anomoly in 
California: A handgun can be 
bought after Mmp!y filling 
out a form and waiting 15 
days. But to buy nonlethal 
teargas requires a permit and 
the passing of a course of 
instruction. Only certain 
kinds of gas are permissible, 
and possession of il!e~al 
teargas is a felony, as IS Its 
.use for anything other than 
self defense. 

"Our basic belief is that 
firearms laws to .not reduce 
crime, do not have any effect 
on the criminal and only 
serve to restrict or disarm 
law-3biding citizens." said 
John Adkins. spokesman for 
the NRA. "You give 
government power and SClme 
way or other t hat power will 
be abUSed." 

Anti·control groups have 
gone to great lengt hs on 
ot'C8hion. An Ohio gun WlKJP 

once distributed a poster ot 
Abner Mikva, then a 
Congressman from ·IIlinois. 
witha bull eye superimposed 
over hi face for apparent use 
at rifle ranges. Mikva had 
authored some of the 
strongest gun co ntrol 
legislation and was a highl y 
active anti -handgun spokes· 
man. 

With chances now strong 
t hat even such laws that 
exist may be w£'ake ned 
furt her in Congre s" citizens 
are in the posi tion of having 

. to decide for I hemselve · 
whether a handgun intended 
for self·defense is a safeguard 

. or a hazard. 
"We do not condone the 

purchase of handguns. In 
many ca es it' a mi take," 
say Sgt. Bernard Shaw of 
the crime prevention unit in 
the San Francisco police 
department. 

To be u eful in ca e of 
attack;a gu n has to be readily 
available and its owner must 
be killed in it use. 
Otherwise it can easily be 
turned against him. 

Guns bought by law· 
abiding citizens with self-
protection in mind of I en find 
their way into the n(!nd of 
crimina l . Upto halftheguns 
u 'ed in crime are , tolen. 

In San Francisco, aid 
Shaw, there are up to 1500 
burglaries a month . andgun ' 
are among the first items to 
be tolen . In half the 
burglarized homes contained 
guns, that could mea n 
around 700 new weapons out 
in the streets each month, he 
estimated. 

Guns in the home are 
seldom u ed for self-defen e 
and far more often become 
instruments of tragedy, 
according to Oras in. " A 
woman might buy it (or 
riding through the city in a 
car. But then she might have 
a fight with her hus band and 
instead of throwing some· 
thing at him she might shoot 
him." 

However, with faith in 
institutions that providt: for 
publ ic safety crumbling , 
many are deciding they need 
firearms. 

"Police protections is 
geting les - things aregoing 
to get worse and people 
should know how to defend 
themselves," said Vern 
Truesdale, a Canadian who 
has written and pubished a 
book. How /0 Choose a 
Survival Weapon , for the 
Coming Bad Years, which he 
sells through the mail. 

"I firmly believe there is an 
economic collapse coming 
and I wrote the book with 
that in mind," he said. More 
people would be likely !o 
crack und£'r the stram , saId 
Truesdale. "and if they have 
a gun you better have one too. 
The only defense against a 
gun is a gun," 

Quite a different view of 
self-defense is held by Terry 
Dohion, who is writing a 
book to be tilled Stlfe alld 
AliI/C. It is oo:'ed in part on 
principles deriv.~ from .the 
martial art of aikIdo. whICh 
he has studied and taught for 
many Yl'ars. 

Dobson turns around t ht.· 
gun advorates ' f<l"oritt' 
argument. which is that 
"guns ~o not ~i,l~ ~lple. 
people kIll pl'nple. I hat IS SII. 
he agrees. Const.'(luently. st'lf: 
defense should he a malll'r lIt 

people dea ling with people 
rather t han a matter of guns. 

The possession of guns 
"reinforces paranoia," says 
Dobson . "Don't worry about 
the increase of guns - just be 
alert to danger." he advises. 
"If ¥ou are faced with a gun, 
don t resist it. " 

The .form of self·defense 
that Dobson teaches requires 
a person under attack to eek 

. to protect not him elf but his 
attacker - from the harm 
that wou ld come to the 
attacker from commission of 
the act. The byproduct is self-
protection. 

Instead of being based. on 
resi tance, this proce 's calls 
Jor an acceptance of the 
oncoming force, a blending 
with it and its redirect ion 
such a way that no injury 
occurs. 

ays Dobson:" ogun law 
wil l stop a person who is 
determined to lay down his 
life to kill somebody ." 
However, he holds, many 
deaths could be avoided .by 
. temming the proliferation of 
handguns. . 

Though gun control 
advocates are not optimist ic 
about chances for federal 
legislat ion in I hl' milling 
Reagan years, Orasin notes: 
" 0 one is safe in this 
country. The randomness of 
killing is increasing and it s 
ha. spread nationwide. The 
next administrat ion will 
have to face that somehow. "

1\P program has openings abroad 
'rom c:.lifont .. Nota 

UC offers q u a lifi ed 
students the oppostunity to 
study abroad while earning 
UC credit toward graduation. 
This is acco mplished 

t~h the Education 
A Program (EAP), a 
universi ty·wide program 
with administrative head-
guar ters on t he San ta 
Barbara campus, which 
enables students to study at 
one of almost 50 host 
institutions in 21 countries. 

Today EAP is active in 
Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin 
America, and the Middle 
East. More than 9,000 
students have participated in 
the program since its opening 

a t the Bordeaux, France, 
Study Center in 1962. [n 
return, over 1,700 foreign 
students, a ided by non-
resident tuition scholarships 
and other financial assIs-
tance, have enrolled throUJh 
the special EAP ReciprOCIty 
Program at one of the nine 
UC campuses. 

C u r r ently 662 dUC 
students who demonstrate 
serious ness ' of pu r pose, 
willingness to adapt to a new 
c ult ure, and academic 
preparedness are reaping t he 
benefits of international 
study. Study Center locales 
differ in enviornment, 
ambience, and activities, 
depending on the host 

country, and each Study 
. Center stresses academic 

variety. All UC students are 
dually enrolled both on their 
home campus and in the host 
institution during their year 
abroad. 

Once abroad, adjustment 
to t he fore~ country is 
usually faCIlitated by a 
p r eliminary intensive 
language a nd orientation 
program w hich prepares t he 
student for enrollment in 
those institu tions where 
instruction is in a language 
other than English . This 
phase of the program also 
orients the participant to the 
surrounding enviornment 
and culture.

The Study Center Direc-
tor, who typically is a UC 
faculty member is residence, 
and his or her staff advise 
students during the year both 
on academic and personal 
matters, assist in housing 
and specific problems, plan 
field trips, and p rovide 
informatIon on cultural 
opportunities. 

EAP participants typically 
learn to adapt to different 
social codes and accustom 
themselves to a n ew 
language, diet, and customs. 
By living with foreign 
students or famil ies in 
private homes, apartments, 
boarding homes and in 
university dormitories, most 

UC students take full 
advantage of the cross-
cultural exchange opportuni· 
ties and strive for, a nd often 
achieve, complete integration 
into the foreign society. 

- Student have ample 
opportunity and time on 
weekends and long vacation 
periods to complement their 
academic endeavors with 
local and more extensive 
travel. Participan ts often 
ex~lore t he .surroundi ng

holidays with their new 
foreign counterparts and

8 The Guardian Thursday, January 8, 198) 

is appointing discs of 1981 
Stones slacken; Pink Floyd padded 

BY TED BURKE 
Art~ Edilor 

EflloliolUll R~8CU~ - The 
Rolling Stones: 

E -cli though Some Girls 
was a wide improvement 
over the lazy boned rock and 
roll that the Rolling Stones 
had produced after Exil~s on 
Mlli".tree/, I never thought 
it was really thai good. There 
were no songs on the par 
with "Satisfaction," 
"Sway," or "Backstreet 
Girl" (to choose three from a 
sizable collection of classics). 
Still, I didn't think that the 
Stones would go as slack as 
they sound on E".oliolUll 
R • ." •. Maybethey'rejaded, 
maybe they're tired, maybe 
they're just burned out by the 
stress of being the "world's 
greatest rock and roll band." 
but whatever the cause, the 
symptoms are apparant and 
irritating. Keith Richards 
and Ron Wood charge 
through Chuck Berry riffs 
like drunks stumbling 
throu~h plate ~Iass, Charlie 
Watts drumming has never 
sounded more uninteresting, 
and Bill Wymans' basswork 
sounds reSembles nothing so 
much as sleepwalk profiency. 
Jagger is the only one who 
sounds as thouJ{h he's havin 
any fun, but I suspect its fun 
for the wrong reason: he 
knows precisely what he can 
get away with throu~hout 
the songs he sings With a 
leering, mocking contempt. 
The problem is that the 
contempt is aimed not at any 
of the sacred cows his 

auc\ience like LO impaled, 
but rather at them. That's 
the problem: mean'spiriled 
lazine . Wbo needs it? 
2. The Wan ~ Pink Fluyu: 

Except for I h title track 
(featuring a nice, rubbery 
guitar solo by Larry ~al\~n), 
r found Th~ Wall like most 
double record sets, to ~ 
needlessly padded, full of 
incidental sound effects, 
redundant instrumental 
atmospherics and the like. 
This doubtles Iy comes from 
the fact that Pink Floyd, like 
some author and film 
makers, think that "bigger is 
better," an unfortunate 
inclination when what an 
artist actually has is far 
shorter. Also, I'm a bit tired of 
their brand of anti· 
intellectualism, which, 
though intended by author 
David Gilmour to be ironic in 

. some way, only reinforces the 
alienation felt on a large part 
of their audience, and 
reinforces the old radical 
right paranoia that rock and 
roll is an enemy weapon 
meant to make little kids 
more than dumb, drolling 
cretins who'll smash the 
tate for a six pack and some 

angel dust. Don't need no 
education, my ass. 
3. Th~ Rivu - Hruce 
Springsteen: 

I keep waiting for 
Springsteen to come out with 
a record that'll prove to me 
what critics and his fans 
have claimed for years: that 
he's the greatest rock and 
roller out of the 70s. I'm still I 

aiting. 
4. Face to Face - Trevor 
Rabin: 

Trevor Rabin , his same 
lIalllt!U uebu t recuru, was my 
leeper of 1979. Eclectic, hard 

rocking, arty and complex, 
Rabin seemed like a Todd 
Rundgren who knew what he 
was doing. FQc~ 10 Face, his 
1980 follow·up, agai n has

Actors, Script tnake 'Tribute' 
BY LYNETTE TOM 

Staff Writer 
"Scottie Templeton is a 

failed screenwriter, televi · 
sion producer, and occasional 
Reno blackjack dealer, He is a 
charming and beloved, yet 
unmotivated talent on the 
fringes of show business - a 
real and vulnerable man 
never facing up to life. But 
now, at the age of 51, he just 
do just that, 'having 
discovered that he is dying of 
leukemia." 

When I read the above 
passage from the press 
release of Templeton's film, 
Tribute, m y immedia te 
react on was, "Dh , no .. . not 
the old happy -go-Iucky -
individual -coping- with-the 
horror -of- terminal-cancer 
routine again." But J decided 
to see T ribute anywa y, 
figuring that s ince it tarred 
Jack Lemmon , the picture 
couldn 't be a ll that bad. It 
wasn't, and I felt like the 
s keptic in tho~e lighl beer 
commercial: who exclaim: to 
hi s buddies. " I'm surpri 'ed!" 

Much of I he surprise comes 
from 'creenwriter Bernard 

Scottie Templeton (Lemmon) 
forced to follow through with 
the first commitment of his 
life: bridging the 14-year old 
gap between himself and his 
son, Jud (Robby Benson). 

Of course , the script 
wouldn 't click without the 
right actors. Jack Lemmon 

dominat eH the .screen as the 
frenetic and irrepressable 
Scottie. bringing both 
throaty chortles with an 
outrageous masquerade in a 
chicken suit and moistened 
eyes with a candid thank·you 
s peech to his friends and 
family .

hi s prev iou s s tage pro-

picture, Same Time Next

h a ndlin g of a 26-yea r -
running love affair. Tribute 
follows the arne formula, 
from its Broadway origins to 
it Hollywood version with 
the same great res ult s. 
Slade's flair for sharp, fast 
dialogue and his s hrewd 
sense of comedic timing are 
continued, if not intens ified ,

Williams a joy in bizarre 'Popeye' 
BY RICK GREENE 

The major motion picture 
releases of this past holiday 
season will probably linger in 
local theaters for another 
month or so in the hope that 
some of tht:1Il win c.It:vdujJ 
into belated blockbusters. 
While Popeye didn't bust any 
blocks, it was one of the half· 
handful of films that did well 
last month. 

Film a cinematic mish-mash the bottom. They never roll, s lide or pop. They have the 
usual anchors tatooed on 
them and hundreds of little 
red hairs. And they give an 
amazing performance. 

Not that it deserved to do 
well, but aside from the 
evocative Raging Bwll, there 
wasn't much worthwhile to 
see. Po/Jeye certainly has 
wider appeal than, say, The 
Mirror Cracked or The 

and a terrible series of 
television cartoons in the 
early 60s. Now he's back in 
what is best described as a 
live·action cartoon. 

Popeye is the most 
schizophrenic motion picture 
since the TIt,. Faces of Eve, 
from its production com· 
panies (an unlikely combina· 
tion of Paramount and Walt 
Disney) to its disappearing 
plotline and _peculiar 
characterization. The film is 
both a musical and a comedy. 
It .is also an introspective 

Duvall is great Olive Oyl 
For",,,la, as any proper 
bubble-gum movie should. It 
is the type of film that easily 
attracts audiences into the 
theater, but unfortunately 
does all the wrong things 
GIlce it jets them there. 

The character of Popeye 
was <2'e8ted by E.C. Seegar in 
his TIti",bl, Thealer 
newspaper strip of the 20s. 
Later ,-theone-eyed sailor was 
featured in a series of superb 
black and white animated 
cartoo.,s for the Fleischer 
StudiOs in the 308, a fair 
series of color cartoons for 
Famous Studios in the 40s 

definition of relationships 
and sex roles, and an 
examination of purpose and 
self. It all make for a bizarre 
cinema mi h·mas h of values, 
statement and morals. 

The s tory is not based on 
the familiar cartoon ser ies, 
but on the original Seegar 
strip. Therefore. instead of a 
well established ensemble , 
each character must first 
meet one another before 
things get moving. Popeye 
wants to find his lost Pappy. 
Olive thinks she wants to 
marry lliu to, allu the 
mysterious Corflmadore 

wants a piece of the action. 
Mixed in among the 
psychology is a boxing scene, 
some fight scenes, a romantic 
scene, a lunch and a 
breakfast scene, a chase 
scene and a grand finale. 
Director Robert Altman even 
manages to work in a plastic 
octopus. 

The fun in this picture 
comes out of the lead 
performances. Robin Wil · 
liams as Popeye and Shelly 
Duvall .as Olive Oyl are a joy 
to behold, magically bringing 
to life two grotesque people in 
an exaggerated miniature 
society. They consisten tly 
look, $ound and act just as 
Popeye and Olive are 
expected to. In direct 
contrast, though , is nearl y 
every other character in thi s 
peculiar little town of 
Sweethaven. The inhabi· 
tants either scowl or grin 
s tupidl y, always seem to be 
eating, and play their parts 
alternately traight and 
comic. The grea~est crime,of 
all i the offkey, drab singing 
voices they all eem to 
possess. 

Altman made a crucia l 
mistake in trying to turn a 
iight comic str ip ' into a 
sociologica l musical.The film

around t heir neck s that read: 
"With Ronald Reagan. the 
criminals and guerrilla of 
Central American and EI 
Salvador will be finished." 

Military aid is being 
promised . A member of the 
Reagan transition team. 
Pedro San Juan, has advised 
the Pre ident·elect of the 
dangers of encouraging land 
reform or more equitable 
economic policy. The 
message is clear. The US is so 
afrC\id of the poj)u lar force in

support the extremi ts of the

At a time when forces of 
liberation are on the move in 
both the East and West, 
leaders on both sides are 
succumbing to the tempta·

trouble when the managers 
of neither sy tern know how 
to run an economy or sat isfy

7 \Vorst records 
of last year 
continued from page 8 
some good moments: but 
Rabin has pared him elf 
down for t he commercial 
market. He contin ues to play 
fine guitar (a cross be~wee.n 
Al DiMeola and Ritchie 
Blackmore). but the ongs are 
in the Foreigner / Bad 
Company. ie. rather dumb 
hard rock cum heavy metal 
with fleeting garnishes of 
melody. Rabin ca n do much 
better if he'd give himself a 
chance. 
5. Raisin' Cain - Johnny 
Winter 

For reasons I can't discern, 
Winter has turned down the 
volume of hi s guitar and 
buried the sound in the mix. 
A shame. Of the guitar heroes 
from the late sixties, Winter 
has been the most reliable, 
maintaining a level of 
expertise that've made his 
records flashy, unforced rock 
and roll fun. Here he offers an 
occasional riff here or a 
subdued solo there. but 
overall his instrumental is 
missing. Next time, Johnny, 
crank that guitar and let the 
fingers do the talking. 
6. Tusk - Fleetwood Mac 

Fleetwood Mac and 
Rumours went a long way 
to give an identity to the band 

that was never sure who 
would be in the group one 
record to the next. and with 
the benefit of excellent 
material and an appealingly 
rustic vocal sty le, both 
records were solid release. 
On Tusk. the Mac sou nd like 
the y've become full of 
themselves, at least full 
enough to think that they 
could duplicate the Beatles 
"white album·· wit h a double· 
set of their own. Strained. 
strai ned, strained. Plus 
Stevie Ni k is losing her 
voice. 
7. Audiovisiolls - Kansa 

First everyone thought 
tnat it was great that at last 
there was an American band 
that could play progressive 
rock in the British ELP·Yes· 
Gentle Giant mold. That was 
over six years ago. While the 
face of art rock has taken the 
CQe from Roxy Music and 
Ta.,Iking Heads. Kansas 
continues with their ersatz 
complexity, piling chord 
change upon chord change, 
fill upon fill. solo upon solo, 
with hardly any substance 
under the filigree. These 
guys are tedious, and people 
who like them deserve to be 
locked in a room with a stereo 
salesman.
