DUAL NUMBERS 
HAMPER CRISIS 

RESPONSE 
Common sense dictated 
dialing 911, but doing so 
slowed down the arrival 
of help, witness says. 

By Matthew McArdle 
ASSOCIATE NEWS EDITOR 

The pedestrian who aw Sixth 
College freshman Daniel Sobel fall 
to his death from Gilman Parking 
Structure last month in an apparent 
suicide did what almost anyone would 
do during an emergency: Dial 911 . 

However, the witness, a Sixth 
College ophomore who wished to 
remain anonymous, did not anticipate 
that the decision to dial 911 from her 
cell phone would actually delay police 
response to the scene. 

UCSD, along with many other 
universities, has its own police force. 
The UCSD- Police Department, which 
only has jurisdiction on and immedi-
ately around the campus, also has its 
own number, (8S8) S34-HELP. Dialing 
911 from any land line on campus 
transfers an emergency call directly 
to campus police, and S34-HELP will 
connect both cell phones and land 
lines to campus police, according to 
Detective John Smart. If dialed from 
a cell phone, however, the traditional 
911 emergency number connects the 
call to a California Highway Patrol 
office located in the area code of the 
cell phone, forcing the CHP emer-
gency dispatcher from the outside area 
to transfer the call to the appropriate 
local authorities, Smart said. 

"You lose response time when you 
switch dispatchers; he said. "It's like 
when you play the telephone game. 
From here to there, a lot of things will 
change:' 

In Sobel's case, the witness initially 
called 911 from her cell phone at 1l:34 
p.m. on Feb. 9. After being notified 
by CHP officials at 11 :39 p.m., UCSD 
police arrived at the scene at 1l:44 
p.m., and the ambulance arrived one 
minute later, a total of 11 minutes after 
the original distress call was placed. 

The witness, who talked to 911 
dispatchers twice from her cell phone, 
said that she was outraged that author-
ities tOOK so long to respond during 
the "most serious emergency I've ever 
faced in my life." 

"It would have been faster to run to 
the hospital across the street," the wit-
ness said, referring to the VA Medical 
Center. "It's so shocking because there 
are three hospitals nearby.' 

Smart said that campus police 
always respond as quickly as possible 
when a life is in danger, but would not 
say whether or not a faster response 
time could have made a difference 
in providing aid to Sobel, who was 
treated unsuccessfully at the scene by

Univ~rsity 
Finds UCSD 

Doc Negligent 
By Charles Nguyen 

NEWS EDITOR 

The UC General Counsel criti-
cized a UCSD doctor for being 
negligent in his duties at a sister 
transplant program at UC Irvine, 
which was shut down after several 
patients died waiting for donated 
organs. 

In the report, the university's 
lawyers concluded that officials 
from the United Network for 
Organ Sharing, which provide 
organs for patients, were misled to 
believe that Marquis Hart would 
be phYSically present at UC Irvine,

Current A.S. Vice President of 
Academic Affairs Harry Khanna 
has 10 other executive candidates 
running under his Student Voice! 
slate, mirroring the structure of 
Earl Warren College senior Daniel 
Watts' Tritons United! slate, which 
also has 10 candidates for top A.S. 

Coun~il positions. 
Khanna, a Warren junior, was 

elected on the Revolution! plat-
form during last year's election, and 
spearheaded the creation of a new 
Student-Run Television charter. 

Watts, who is in his fifth year at 
UCSD, has been heavily involved 
in campus politics, and ran for A.S. 
preSident last year, taking second 
place. 

While there are only two candi-
dates, Watts said that it doesn't nec-
essarily mean only two parties will 
be running in the entire election. 

"There are college council 
parties . that are running against 
Tritons United!'s senate and col-
lege council candidates," he said. 
"As far as the all-campus races 

go, the one-on-one face-offs will 
ensure that the winning candidate 
receives a majority of the votes, 
which hasn't usually happened in 
previous years because of third-
party candidates." 

Khanna agreed that only having 
two "parties" was not necessarily 
an anomaly. In fact , last year's elec-
tions were more abnormal, with 
three slates on the ballot, he said.

Report: Pay for Administrators Gro.wing 
By Charles Nguyen 

NEWS EDITOR 

Salaries of university adminis-
trators have risen steadily across 
the nation, with this year seeing a 
record increase in raises given to 
public university officials. 

Data gathered by the College 
and University Professional 
Association for Human Resources 
found that the median salary of 
college administrators rose by 3.S 
percent this academic year. Last 
year, the increase was 3.3 percent, 
compared to a 2.S-percent jump 
the year before that. 

The report does not come as 
a surprise, as the trend of ris-
ing administrator wages has lasted 
for IS years, according to CUPA-
HR Director of Communications 
Gayle Kiser. 

The latest survey is yet another 
example of universities' skewed

Campus Researchers 
Fight to Stop Bird Flu 

Responding to the growing 
threat of a bird flu pandemic. 
UCSD has begun studyi ng the 
causes. risk factors and pre-
vention of bird flu in humans. 
Collaborating closely with both 
national and international hea lth 
o rganizations. researchers are 
developing ways to understand 
and contain the flu 's threat to both 
human and animal health and to 
provide new methods to control a 
potential outbreak. 

Researchers from San Diego 
Super omputer Center at VCSD 
are using a computationa l data 
grid to study ' the extent of bi rd 
flu virus resistance to the human 
im mune system, providing an 
international "gene tic library" for 
d ifferent strains of bird flu a nd 
identifying n~w leads for drug 
development and screen ing. 

In addi tion. UCSD person-
ne l from the Ca lifornia Office 
of Bina tional Border Health 
are c urrently working with the 
Californ ia Department of Health 
Services to address regiona l 
strategies and readiness for the 
spread of a possible bird flu pan-

border region . 

Tijuana A.I.D.S. 
Cases Skyrocket 
The number of Tijuana resi-

dents aged 15 to 49 with HIV or 
A.I.D.S. is increasing more rap-
idly than expected and may be 
as high as one case for every 125 
people. approaching the United 
Nations definition of an epidem-
ic, according to the results of a 
new UCSD-Ied study. 

Located just across the U.S. 
border. directly south of San 
Diego, the city of Tijuana, with a 
population of about 1.2 million. 
has an A.I.D.S. ratio that is three 
times higher than the Mexican 

national average. according to 
Kimberly C. Brouwer. a UCSD 
family and preventative medi-
c ine professor and the leader 
of the team that conducted the 
study. 

The model used in the study 
suggests that injection-drug use 
and the sex trade may be driving 
the increasi ng number of HIV 
and A.1.D.5. cases. Researchers 
also found the rate of infection 
in high-risk groups - me n who 
have sex with men. injection-
drug users who share needles. 
sex workers and pregnant women 
- were greatly increasing and 
that Tijuana 's status as a major 
drug trafficking center may be a. 
contributing factor in the rise of 
HIV and A. I.D.S. cases. 

Carlos Magis-Rodriguez. the 
director of Mexico's federal HIVI 
A. I.D.S. agericy and a co-author 
of the stud y. indicated that the 
country would fight the spread 
of the fatal disease by offer-
ing more free testing. advocating

Statements made by Irvine

Irvine Medical Center CEO Ralph 
Cygan. were a large part of the mis-
communication, the report stated. 
Specifically. Cygan authorized 
Hart's personnel forms. which 
indicated that he would be spend-
ing all his professional time at the 
Irvine site. 

However. the Irvine Medical

Hart was booted from his 
administrative post at UCSD ear-
lier this month. but still works as a 
member of the transplant program

on the surgeons' presence duri ng

than $1 biUion in forgone tax pay-
ments, and all of the social services 
and financial aid that money could 
have funded. 

Even as UCSD claws its own 
way toward privately raising more 
than $1 billion in what the cam-
pus calls its "Imagine What's Next" 
campaign, university students and 
administrators need to stop to con-
sider whether the growing impor-
tance of individual charity actu-
ally makes higher education - and 
society - better off. 

Stanford University political sci-
ence professor Rob Reich makes a 
good case for why it doesn't. 

In the most recent issue of 
Stanford's Social Innovation Review, 
Reich makes a very convincing 
defense for what he sees as "a fail-
ure of philanthropy" - the title of 
his essay. Indeed, he makes clear, 
America's system of charitable giv-
ing does less to help alleviate social 
ills, and more to simply make the 
rich even richer. 

First, some background: In the 
United States, the federal tax code 
encourages donations to nonprofit 
institutions by allowing taxpayers 
to deduct their charity from the 
taxes they owe to the government. 
For example, if a wage earner in 
the highest (35-percent) tax bracket 
makes $1,000,000, $350,000 would 
normally go to the federal govern-
ment. However, if she then donates 
that 51,000,000 to a good cause, the 
wage earner does not need to give 
the government its cut, amounting 
to, in effect, a subSidy on charitable 
giving. 

In 2005 alone, the subsidy cost 
the federal government an esti -

mated $35 billion, or roughly 0.02 
percent of its total revenue, money 
that could have been used to pay 
for essential services for the poor. 
America provides the world's most 
generous tax concessions, according 
to economist Charles Clotfelter, and 
"no other nation grants subsidies at 
such high levels or across so many 
activities," argues economist Burton 
Weisbrod. 

Of course, there would be noth-
ing wrong with the system if chari-
ties, and universities specifically, 
used donations to help their low-
income students. After all, why have 
government bureaucrats dole out 
cash when the nonprofit world can 
do it equally well? The problem, 
though, is that only a small portion 
of private university donations are 

ere 'would be 
nodring wrong with 

the system if charities, 
and universities 
specifically, used 
donations to help 

low-income students. 
The proble~, though, 

is that only a small 
portion of private 

university donations 
are distributed in a 
'need-based' way?' 

distributed in a "need-based" way. 
Though UCLA will use some 

of its new largesse to create 30,000 
scholarships and fellowships, nearly 
$800 million of it will be dedicat-
ed to medical research and patient 
care, according to the Los Angeles 
Times. Even more will go to pay for 
specialized research centers, new 
endowed chairs and professorships 
and the like. 

At UCSD, private money is cur-
rently being spent to construct a 
graduate business s hool, even as 
the rest of the campus faces a dire 
building-maintenance crisis and has 
no money to rebuild the crumbling 

facilities that house its undergradu-
ate classes. 

In the fall, UC President Robert 
C. Dynes argued that the university 
should use some of its private dona-
tions to top off the salaries of the 
university's highest-paid adminis-
trators and staff, who already make 
more than 5350,000 a year. And 
UCSD is, at this moment, using 
money donated to the university to 
pay Chancellor Marye Anne Fox's 
monthly rent of $6,500. 

Indeed, one of the reasons the 
university uses donations to pay 
for these seemingly less worthy 
projects is because the state does 
not see them important enough 
to fund with tax dollars. However, 
because the government cannot 
control what the subsidized tax dol-
lars go toward, UC administrators 
can use private money to pay for 
inefficient programs. Unlike state 
money, which entails accountability 
- including probing audits into the 
university's compensation policies 
- private donations come largely 
without overSight, especially when 
those who donate do so upon their 
death. 

Outside of the University of 
California, things look much the 
same. Because benefactors gener-
ally give to their alma maters, the 
money often goes to universities 
that need it the least. For example, 
the top four universities with the 
largest endowments in 2004 were all 
elite, prestigious schools - Harvard, 
Yale, Princeto'1 and Stanford. Not 
a single campus of the California 
State University, by contrast, was 
among the top 25 schools. 

Combined, the top 10 schools 
(only two of them are public, 
state-supported ones) have endow-
ments worth more than $87 billion. 
Assuming that most of that money 
was raised from private donations 
and with the current tax rates, these 
endowments deprived the federal 
government of more than $30 bil-
lion in tax revenue. That's a lot of 
Pell Grants and subsidized student 
loans. 

Given the terrible financial prob-
lems facing the states. and their pro-
pensity to cut higher education in 
favor of more popular programs like 
prisons, more and more universi-
ties will surely look toward private 
donors for help. That does not bode 
well for the nation's most disadvan-
taged students and campuses.

Embrace Sucking, Because 
We Can't Excel at Everything 

There are those who celebrate their newfound freedom from parental units by snort-
ing cocaine, skipping church or hav-
ing unprotected sex while swearing 
and snortiJlg cocaine in the bushes 
behind church. Then there are those 
of us who celebrate our indepen-
dence in more subtle ways. Eating 
ice cream for dinner. Leaving the 
house in that. And 

to catch glimpses of the explosive 
decor lingering in my abode. 

Why my lack of care for my 
room's neatness? The whole rebel-
lion thing, of course, and the simple 
fact that it's rare that anyone besides 
me goes in tnere. And when some-
one does, they're either used to the 
mess or vulnerable to my excuses 
"(I don't know why my room is so 

- offspring of ~~~~~~-~---Â­
dirtyl I think it 
was the cats!"). 
Things would 
change if I had 
a guy to impress 
or a set of par-

neat freaks, you'll 
appreciate this 
one - not clean-
ing one's room. 

My name is 
Marianne. I have 
my own room, 

Madden ents who came 
--------- down to visit me 

and don't give a shit about cleanli-
ness. This is my story. 

It started small. An ever-expand-
ing wardrobe met a finite closet, 
resulting in a small spray of clothes 
on the floor. A few papers were 
stacked up, a few annotated Post-It 
notes soared, a few burned CDs 
were flung. I won't say who commit-
ted these small atrocities. It wasn't 
me. I think it was the gnome that 
lives under my bed. 

Then things escalated. A roll of 
wrapping paper and two pillows 
made their way under the desk -
and they're still there. The top of 
the coffee table-slash-storage unit 
disappeared under papers, folders, 
pens, receipts and a gigantic jewelry 
box. The sheets on the bed started 
resembling Twisty Bread. And the 
small spray of clothes turned into 
a mountain of cotton, rayon, nylon 
and other fabrics ending in -on. 

And vacuuming? Dusting? 
Tidying up the flurries of papers? 
Please. My roommates are lucky if I 
dose my bedroom door when I leave 
the house each day so they don't have 

- but Mr. Right 
is MIA and my parents haven't wit-
nessed the remarkable synergy of my 
I KEA furnishings since I purchased 
them more than a year ago. 

So why should I bother? The dust 
bunnies keep me warm at night, and 
as I used to exasperatedly tell my 
mother when I still lived at home, I 
know where everything is. Really. I 
know my checkbook is behind the 
lamp. I know my sewing kit is in 
one of these drawers somewhere, 
probably nesting with some blank 
CDs. And my textbooks? Yep, totally 
here. J swear I saw them the other 
day. My organization system may be 
unconventional, but it's damn near 
flawless. 

If there is a bigger issue here 
(which I doubt there is, but let's 
humor ourselves), it is: I need a 
housekeeper. No, that's not it. It is: I 
need a hot boyfriend with a wicked 
case of OCD and a lot of time on 
his hands. 

No, no, no. The lesson is that 
it's amazing how inept people can 
be. People Who Have It Together 
(which, yes, includes me) . These 

are people with jobs and a 4.0 and 
toned calves. CEOs who can't leave 
the house without misplacing their 
keys at least twice; loving moth-
ers with terrible phone voices and 
messy table manners; chancellors of 
universities who don't know, or care, . 
what a decent haircut looks like. 

But ya know? That's all peachy 
(and really fun to poke fun at). We 
can't all be perfect. In my case, if 
I appear somewhat competent at 
any point in time, it's a downright 
miracle. 

I declare: It's time we reasserted 
our right to not give a shit about 
being good at certain things. To 
really suck in certain areas. To fight 
for one's right to climb over a three-
foot pile of clothes every morning. 
And if you can kill two birds with 
one stone by disguising, or inter-
preting, Texas-sized ineptitude as 
rebellion - sweet, valorous rebel-
lion! - bless you, child. 

Even the most solicitous over-
achiever simply cannot care about, 
or excel at, everything. Nor should 
they. Seriously, I tried, and I failed 
miserably. "Caring about gett.ing 
rip-roaring drunk" collided with 
"Excelling at school." Then, the next 
morning, "ExceHing at looking fash -
ionable and put-together" conflicted 
with "Being good at throwing up 
all over myself;' with ugly, smelly, 
chunky results. And it forced me 
to be great at running home and 
changing outfits, when frankly I'm 
more gifted at finding the nearest 
comfy chair and drooling all over 
myself when I fall asleep in it. 

I'm not sure where this is going, 
but I'm sure that you understood 
whatever point I was trying to make. 
I just know my room is dirty, my 
shirt is crusted with vomit and 
drool, and I don't care.

GUEST COMMENTARY--
Muslims Respond to Cartoons 

By Farhad Noorzay 

T he presence of the concept of freedom of speech, which Muslims respect and value, 
and the concept of respecting and 
honoring Prophet Mohammed (Peace 
Be Upon Him) in Islam are often 
misunderstood by the West and the 
Islamic world. Muslims' misunder-
standing of the concept of freedom of 
speech, often due to the poor qUality of 
its practical application, and Western 
civilizations' lack 
of ability to value 

The West should take it as a challenge 
to understand Islam and Muslims just 
as Muslims should take it upon them-
selves to better understand the con-
cept of freedom of speech. 

People here in the West cannot 
comprehend how much Muslims 
love Prophet Mohammed (pbuh). He 
is dearer to us Muslims than our 
parents, than our children, than our 
grandchildren, than our money, than 
our own selves: Ask any Muslim, reli-
gious or not, "What does Prophet 

Mohammed (pbull) 
mean to you?" and 

honoring Prophet 
Mohammed are 
currently causing 
tensions among 
Muslims and non-
Muslims. We ask 
ourselves, how do 
we work together 
to bring about a 
solution and ease 
tension? 

~~~. c values are just 
as important as any 

other religions values; 
therefore, they should 
be dealt with in the 

you will see what I

The West needs 
to understand our 
love for Prophet 
Mohammed (pbuh) 
and respect it and 
all other Islamic 

same manner?' 
It is important 

to understand that 
Muslims do not desire to eliminate 
freedom of speech; instead, we wish 
for the West tn alter this concept, as 
it has been done in other cases, so 
it does not contlict with the Muslim 
value of honoring and respecting our 
beloved prophet (pbuh). Muslims do 
not believe the problem is freedom 
of speech; instead, it is the double 
standard that is often associated with 
this concept. Islamic values are just 
as important as any other religion's 
value ; therefore, they should be dealt 
with in the same manner. How else do 
we wish to live together as neighbors 
and friends, as humans on this Earth 
struggling to make a living based on 
ou r beliefs? 

The West understands freedom of 
speech, which Muslims appreciate, but 
does not understand Islamic values. 

concepts if it truly 
wants to destroy misunderstandings 
between Muslims and non-Muslims. 
Contrary to what many believe, we 
will never force anyone to accept our 
beliefs, but we will firmly ask for 
respect and will take actions to ensure 
we are respected, as would any other 
group of people. 

Again, the message is that freedom 
of speech should be modified so that 
it does not clash with the values of 
over 1.3 billion Muslims - just like it 
has been altered in Austria, Belgium, 
France, Germany, Poland and other 
places, where denying the Holocaust is 
a crime. We see current examples such 
as British Historian David Irving, who 
was sentenced to 3 years in prison in 
Austria for refuting the existence of

LETTER TO THE EDITOR-
Bookstore Display 

Shocking and Amusing 
Dear Editor: 

1 am by turns appalled and sickly 
amused by UCSD Bookstore's eelÂ· 
ebration of Black History Month. 
The bookstore has several small 
displays celebrating the month (and 
one celebrating "American History 
Month;' whatever that is). Amongst 
the bricÂ·a-brac that students might 
buy to clutter their dorm rooms was 
a display of little ceramic African-
American dolls. 

While in general this may be a 
sign of ethnic pride, 1 was shocked to 
see little, barefoot, faceless AfricanÂ· 
American children in tattered clothÂ· 
ing eating watermelons. Have we 
entered halcyon days in which this is 

not only no longer considered a racist 
image, but actually a positive one?

Double Standards Taint 
Claims of Free Speech 

â¢ MUSLIMS, from page 5 
the Holocaust. Also, in 2003 a French 
court jailed Jean Plantin for publish-
ing works that called into question the 
scope of the Holocaust. 

Surprisingly, Flemming Rose, the 
editor who frrst published the car-
toons of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), 
was sent on indefinite leave one day 
after he told CNN he would con-
sider publishing Holocaust cartoons. 
I do not wish to argue whether there 
is "absolute" free speech or not, but 
I wish to clarify the message: Free 
speech should be altered so that sacred 
Muslim values are respected and not 
attacked. From the examples above we 
see double standards that are unac-
ceptable to MusI.ims and should also 
be unacceptable to any reasonable 
non -Muslim. 

What we want is clear. effective 

actions that display the Western 
respect for Islamic values and ideals. 
such as honoring the prophet (pbuh). 
and we wish to be guaranteed that this 
type of hate will never again be spread 
under the fa lse pretext of "freedom of 
speech:' 

Let me make it clear that we do 
not want superficial apologies that are 
not as deep as our wounds. We want 
effective actions and will not stop our 
protests or boycotts until our prophet 
(pbuh) regains the dignity he deserves 
as our great leader. If you doubt his 
personality or his character, I chaI-
lenge you to learn about him (pbuh), 
and I guarantee you that you will real-
ize why Muslims love and revere this 
great prophet (pbuh).

Exact location Crucial for 
Correct 911 Call Transfer 

â¢ HELP, from page 1 
paramedics. 

"I don't think anyone is ever going 
to know:' Smart said. 

Mary Garcia, the manager of the 
UCSD Police Department's division of 
records and communications, said that, 
ideally. 534-HELP should be dialed in 
anyon-campus emergency. However, 
students should always use 911 if they 
are uncertain of what to do, because 
the call will eventually be forwarded to 
campus police, she said. 

"If a student uses 911 from a cell 
phone, it's very important for that stu-
dent to say exactly where they are on 
the UCSD campus in order for the 
dispatcher to correctly relay the call; 
Garcia said. 

However, that was not the case dur-
ing the initial call, the witness said. 

The witness, whose cell phone area 
code is 858 - a San Diego county area 
code that connects an emergency call 
to a local CHP office - said that the 
91 1 dispatcher asked for her location 
several times, and that the dispatcher 
had to call back again a short time 
later to reconfirm the location. The 
witness also said that the dispatcher 
gave no mention of 534-HELP during 
either call. 

"It didn't seem like they had good 

connections;' the witness said. "I kept 
saying where [ was again and again. 
and 1 was practically screaming at the 
dispatcher. It was ridiculous:' 

Orientation programs for new stu-
dents and staff and resident -adviser 
training materials contain information 
advocating the use of 534-HELP for 
on-campus emergencies in order to 
get a faster response, according to Vice 
Chancellor of Student Life Joseph W. 
Watson. 

Despite Watson's insistence that the 
university encourages students to use 
534-HELP, the keychain with emer-
gency contact phone numbers given 
to new on-campus residents suggests 
534-HELP for nonemergency use only, 
and the magnet provided by UCSD 
Housing and Dining Services for the 
same purpose states, "Dial 911; with 
no reference at all to the 534-HELP 
number. 

Sixth College resident adviser 
Maria Sanchez. a John Muir College 
junior, said that her training requires 
her to mention 534-HELP to residents, 
but beyond mentioning the number, 
RAs are only required to post the num-
ber on the residential bulletin board.

Top Administrators' Salaries 
Getting Largest Increases 

" ADMIN, from page 1 
some sort of increase," Perez . stated 
in an e-mail. 

Perez said that , while unions 
were fighting for higher wages, 
the University of California gave 
its administrators salary bonuses. 
CUPA-HR's survey found that the 
largest hikes in sala ry belonged 
to top campus and university-sys-
tem leaders, with those executives 
receiying a 3.9 percent median wage 
increase. 

The universily has disputed 
claims that its administrators are 
overpaid, and presented an inde-
pendent study released last year -
which revealed top UC executives 
were 15 percent behind comparable 
market salaries - to state senators 
during a higher education subcom-
mittee hearing. Senators, however, 

remained skeptical of the universi-
ty's report. 

"This compensation practice is 
really kind of loosey-goosey," state 
Sen. Jack Scott (D- Pasadena) said. 
"We have people getting paid for 
their sabbaticals and their board 
seats. After a while, we hear about 
a salary but that isn't really the full 
thing:' 

The report spurred the UC Board 
of Regents to approve a measure last 
November that would bring all sala-
ries within comparable market levels 
in a decade. 

While CUPA-HR did not catego-
rize its findings by state, UCSD was 
one of six UC schools included in 
the survey.

SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

"War of the Worlds" is not abysmal because of its 
inconsistent plot, its emotional vacuity, Tom Cruise 
or its shamefully last-minute voice-over by Morgan 
Freeman. Sadly, plenty of films made for millions of 
dollars (in this case $132 million) are just as shitty. 
This particular film earns the title of worst film of 
2005 because it is arrogant, ignorant and, ultimately, 
very indicative of Spielberg's detrimentally foolish 
view of America. 

To understand why, one should look at the origi-
nal H.G. Wells novel that was supposedly being 
adapted. Wells' pivotal sci-fi was about a dying 
breed of accomplished aliens who must leave Mars 
to find a new home, come to Earth, and use their 
ridiculously advanced technological status to clear 
out the pesky humans who aJnMy live there. In the 
first chapter, he alludes to the cwetIIl metaphor, "And

it (both Hermione and

are 16-year-olds), who 
cares that she's jailbait? 
This sorceress prodigy

That auburn hair. That

It just gets better and better 

every year the fiery redhead 
spends at Hogwarts. Imagine 

how ripe she'll be by the seventh,

Or if you've caught the yellow 
fever, and an older type is your taste, 

you could always go for the Asian-by-
way-of-Scotland cutie Cho Chang. Since 

Cedric's out of the picture, she's sure to be in 
need of some tender lovin' comfort. Either way, 

guys and gals, remember: age ain't nothing but a

A t the risk of being black-listed as a potential Roman Polanski, I write this ode to 
the wonders of puberty ... and to 
Daniel Radcliffe in "Harry Potter 
and the Goblet of Fire." There's no 
denying the 17-year-old's allure, 
especially when his supple and 
lithe young body is showcased in 
a steaming bath, albeit with an 
unattractive female ghost Sitting 
in his lap. (That scene is almost 
worth the day or two I spent digi-
tally superimposing my face onto 
hers.) Whether he's waving his 
wand or flying through the air 
with a Firebolt between his legs, 
Radcliffe always manages to turn 
me into a Moaning Myrtle. Is it 
his innocence? The tousled brown 
hair on his furrowed brow? His 
heroics? His angst? Whatever it 
is, there is only one thing on my 
mind after watching that movie, 
and it's definitely not his pink, 
throbbing, veiny ... scar. For those 
of you wary of underage fun, 
there's always the dashing Cedric

rificus totalus" and go to work on

DEATH SCENE WE WI~H WERE REAL 

house of wax 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

That'. Hottt: Paris 'cum hither' 
Hilton gets hers in "House of War.' 

HIATUS 9 

There are only two things that Paris Hilton is good for on screen, and act-
ing isn't one of them. The first 
is explicit, candid sex - the 
gripping subject of " I Night in 

Paris~ a worthy treat for those 
interested in watching skinny, 
trampy celebrity blondes get-
ting it on (come on, there's no 
shame in that). For the rest of 
us, too put-off by the cock hol-
ster to even enjoy watching her 

fuck some guy, "House of Wax" 
produces the next best thing: 
the gruesome death of Paris 
Hilton. Hilton meets her filinic 
demise in exactly the same way 
she lived: on her knees, with a 
pole rammed through her face. 
Sadly, "Wax" is one of the worst 
reels ever to be shat into a film 
can, lacking camp enough to be 
even a hilariously bad movie. 
Every minute is absolute tor-
ture, save that instant of pen-

etration - where for one sweet 
moment, someone shuts that 
bitch the hell up. ~----------------------------~ 8"ce , -c:::..

According to the comic

when one macrames oneself

HOW do you compensate for the most anti-climactic sex scene in one of the most hyped films 
of the year? Throw in the girl from 
"The Princess Diaries" and make her 
take her top off after being on screen 
for all of 10 seconds. But the glory of 
Anne Hathaway's gorgeous rack quick-
ly fades as the "Brokeback Mountain" 
makeup tearn employs the least con-
vincing aging techniques ever used. 
Each time Ang Lee wants to sbow 
the passage of time, Hathaway's hair 
grows several shades lighter and inches 
higher - though the hair changes are 
less successful at alerting the audience 
to the passage of decades and more 
likely to invoke thoughts like, "Damn,

BEST HYPE MORE THAN A YEAR IN ADVANCE 

sna kes on a plane 

For everyone that hasn't heard the news, Hollywood is just playing jokes on us now. "Snakes on a 
Plane,' an action fUm coming to theÂ· 
aters in late 2006, features Samuel L. 
jackson, who signed on as soon as 
he heard the title. It was changed to 
a more focusÂ·group friendly "Pacific 
Air Flight 121 ; but Jackson made the 
studio change it back. He argued that 
from the title alone, you knew whethÂ· 
er or not you wanted to see it. The 
premise is no more than the title and 
top billing: Snakes are released on a 
plane, and there's no one but Samuel 
L. jackson (and Kenan "Good Burger" 
Thompson) to stop them. Droves of 

BEST SEX SCENE 

history of violence 

Rarely does Hollywood get a sex scene right. They're either too weird ("Blue Velvet"), too 
long ("Munich") or not long enough 
("Thelma and' Louise"). But most the 
time they are just blatantly gratuÂ· 
itous. That is not the case with David 
Cronenberg' "A History of Violence:' 

Internet madmen, proving Jackson's 
argument correct, have embraced the 
simple, unadulterated awesomeness of 
"Snakes on a Plane:' inspiring at least 
two TÂ·shirts, a slang phrase ("snakes on 
a plane" is the new "shit happens") and 
hundreds of promises to camp out for 
tickets come Whacking Day. Ifit's good 
enough for Samuel L. to sign up based 
only on the title, it's good enough for 
the rest of us. I'm just looking forward 
to the revelation of the terrorist's evil 
plot to finally hear Samuel 1. Jackson 
say, "We got mothafuckin' snakes on 
this mothafuckin' plane'"

Ready, Mr. Big Shot Hollywood producer? I've got a great script I want to sell you. It 's about a really famous musician, but here's the neat little 
catch: It's not based on any particular one. We just pick 
whatever dead musician we want, and trim and hem 
the script a bit to fit their life. Then comes the best 
part - when the film's really just about their drawnÂ· 
out drug abuse saga and cheating on the wife back

So reads the modern musician biopic formula after 
"Walk the Line:' At least "Ray" delved into its subject's

storylines: Cash's junkie.grade pill habit, and his obsesÂ·

[n the film , there are two explicit 
and emotionally wrenching sex scenes 
with Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) 
and his wife Edie (Maria B.eUo.) The 
first scene is weet: Edie, being the 
good missus, spices up her marriage by 
seducing her husband wearing a cheerÂ· 
leading uniform. But the second love 
scene is one of the most memorable 
to come out of HoUywood in years. [t 
occurs later after Edie discovers that 
her gentle husband of 20 years has an 
expert ability to kill people. Although 

Edie claims to be horrified by her husÂ· 
band's violent ide, their tryst reveals 
otherwise. In the scene, tall grabs 
his beloved wife by the neck, forces 
himself on her, but then turns away 
disgusted by his own brutal behavior. 
But instead of pushing him off her, 
Edie grabs him, embraces him, and 
the two engage in rough.and. tumble 
noÂ· holdsÂ· barred sex, on a staircase no 
less. The scene is poignant, disturbÂ· 
ing and really hot. For as graphic as 
both scene are (yes, there's plenty of

most surprising of all is that the two

capote . 

Capote" was easily one of the most captivating films of the year, incorporating many issues other OscarÂ· nominated pics spent their entire 
two hours exploring less interestingly. The racial tenÂ· 
sions between murderer Perry Smith and investigator 
Alvin Dewey made the racial conflict in "Crash" seem 
piecemeal and trite. 

Truman Capote's homosexuality served more as a 
subtle backdrop for exploring his character than them 
queers in "Brokeback Mountain:' who beat the agony 
of their repressed sexuality into your skulls (or Jake 
Gyllenhaal's ... too tasteless?). And as a biopic, the 
plot is a hell of a lot more interesting than "Walk the 
Line." 

The only problem with making a biographical 
movie about Truman Capote is that it has to feature 
an impersonation of Truman Capote. All the Academy 
members who will vote to give Philip Seymour 
Hoffman the award for Best Actor would be lying if 
they said they didn't cringe a bit when they realized 
that Hoffman would, in fact, talk like that through the 
entire film. Think of the thinnest, Iispiest voice you 
can imagine, then imagine Richard Simmons speakÂ· 
ing with it after being kicked in the baUs, and Capote's 
voice is still more obnoxious. Yet still somehow less 
annoying than Matt Dillon.

UHustle and Flow" Soundtrack 
â¢ Various Artists 
ATlANTIC 

***-j 
There's no reason to beat around the bush: 

Sound tracks to hipÂ· hop movies generally suck. 
It seems that most tracks are album throwaways, 
and continuity is harder to find than SÂ·spots on 
campus. lohn Singleton, however, has compiled 
an impressive lineup for the soundtrack to his 
OscarÂ· nominated "Hustle & Flow:' 

The soundtrack stays true to the movie's 
Southern roots, showcasing some of the Dirty's 
finest, including T.!., Juvenile, Mike jones, 
Webbie, Lil' Scrappy, SBall & MJG, with proÂ· 
duction from Lil' Jon and Al Kapone, among 
others. The soundtrack follows the typical crunk 
formula that has seen so much success in recent 
years: hard bass, sharp snares, whistle samples, 
racing hi Â·hats and shrill synth topped with that 
smooth southern drawl. The consistency of the 
production creates a cohesive album, though it 
gets monotonous when lessÂ· talented MCs such 

as Chopper and TrillviUe step to the plate. 
The real surprise of the album is the same 

surprise this writer got upon seeing the movie: 
that Terrence Howard, portraying protagonist 
Djay, can actually rap. Or, at least, he can act 
like he can rap - convincingly enough to earn 
an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. Djay waxes 
philosophical while staying street on "It's Hard 
Out Here For A Pimp" (nominated for Best 
Original Song), and lays his mackÂ· hand down 
on "Whoop That Trick:' either of which could 
successfully stand .alone. 

This is a necessary addition to the collection 
of any Southern rap fan, and its starÂ·studded 
roster and adherence to the flavor of the film 
make this soundtrack one of the best in recent 
memory.

The end of war 
When the time comes to count the cost, men' will be amazed at, and ashamed of, the 
waste of war. More than any other . a~tivity of men, war eats greedily into resources 
and lives. Nothing is spared in the effort to overcome the 'enemy'; everything is 
sacrificed to the attainment of victory. Thus has man waged relentless strife against 
his neighbour, and not always in . self-defence. As often as not, war has been used for 
the expansion of territory, the accumulation of plunder or, most abhorrently, the 
capture of slaves. The 'spoils of war' is a phrase used lightly to describe the 
underlying purpose of most wars. 

Today, we have reached a time when men must take seriously the task of ending war. 
Men must understand that there is no problem or situation which needs war to solve 
or cure. This being so the nations must together act and end for ever that destructive 
aptitude of men. 

Should they fail to do so, they threaten the very existence of the race. Peace is no 
longer an option for men: they have now in their hands the deadliest weapon of all 
time which, if used in major war, would desecrate the planet and leave it lifeless for 
aeons of time. Why, then, court such disaster, such an end? 

Slippery slope 
Maitreya, you may be sure, will speak thus on HisÂ· emergence. He will show men that 
small wars can lead to terrible consequences, and set men on the slippery slope of 
self-destruction. He will counsel gravely and tum men from the unthinkable. Be 
vigilant but not afraid; trust Maitreya to wisely guide the actions of men. Play your 
part in the task of educating your brothers and sisters and so make lighter His burden. 

Tell all who will listen that the Expected One is here, ready to begin, openly, His 
Mission. That He relies on the men and women of goodwill to work with Him for 
peace and justice, freedom and love. Tell them this. Tell them that Maitreya has the 
simple answer for the world's woes. That sharing will engender the trust that will open 
the door, and the hearts of men, to blessed peace. 

Then will you see the flowering of the human spirit in brotherhoOd and co-operation. 
Then will the problems and blockages melt away, overcome in overflowing goodwill. 

Thus will it be, and thus shall We witness the end of the abomination-of war. Such is 
Maitreya's purpose and firm is His will for its accomplishment. 

[This article from Share International magazine, March 2006, is by a ~enior member of the 
Hierarchy of Masters of Wisdom. His name, well-known in esoteric circles, is not yet being 
revealed. Benjamin Creme, a principal spokesman about the emergence of Maitreya, is in 
constant telepathic contact with this Master who dictated his article to him.}

Challenging Schedule to 
Blame for UCSD's 'I-6 Start 
~ TENNIS, from page 16 
even though we lost those matches, 
we're going in the right direction:' 

This year, the Tritons' sched -
ule has fewer DÂ· lI opponents, anil 
is markedly stocked with DÂ· I foes 
such as Boston College, Gonzaga 
University and 
Yale. 

Kansas City, Miss. Last year, the 
Tritons reached the quarterfinals of 
the tournament, their best frnish as 
a 0Â·11 team. 

If last year's results are any pre-
view of this year's campaign, the 
team has reason to be optimistic 

about its upcomÂ· 
ing schedule. 

Steidl mayer is 
hopeful the schedÂ· 
ule will elevate his 
team's skill and 
poise, and that the 
challenge will not 
demoralize the 
players. 

Ill: the guys take it 
n themselves to u 

"We had a 
tough stretch in 
the beginning, 
but now we have 
an idea of where 
we need to be," 
Rubens said. "Now 
that everyone has 
an idea of what 

improve, we'll give 
ourselves a chance:' 

" Hopefully 
they'll look at it as 
something they're 
learning from, 

- Eric Steidlmayer, 
Men's Tennis Head Coach to expect, it will 

make our playa 

something they're getting better by 
experiencing: Steidl mayer said. "I 
see us growing in confidence." 

Despite the uphill battle, the 
team hopes that the challenge will 
pay dividends come May, when the 
NCAA II West Regional tourna-
ment begins. If the Tritons are suc-
cessful there, they will move on 
to the NCAA Championships in 

lot more focused." 
Steidlmayer hopes to match, if 

not improve, his team's results from 
last year, but he acknowledges that 
there is always room for more progÂ· 
ress. 

"Where we're at right now won't 
get it done," Steidl mayer said. "But 
if the guys take it upon themselves 
to improve, we'll give ourselves a 
chance." 

Explosive Nazarine Offense 
Overwhelms Stunned Tritons 
~ BASEBAlL, from page 16 
baseman David Morehead. 

In the bottom of the sixth inning, 
freshman southpaw Jon Durket 
came into the game in relief and it 
looked as if the Seawolves would 
blow the game wide open after two 
walks to start the inning. However, 
Durket forced a 5Â·4Â·3 double play 
and a lineout to get out of the inning 
unscathed. 

The Tritons tacked on another 
run to their total in the top of the 
seventh inning after sophomore 
Chris Carl smacked a leadoff single 
to right-center and came arGund 
to score on senior outfielder David 
Gomez's two-out triple to left center. 
Suddenly only facing a 6-run deficit 
with two innings left to play, the 
Tritons retained hope for a comeÂ· 
back, only to have the Seawolves 
crush their dreams with a 4 -run 
bottom haJf. 

Point Lorna held the Tritons 
scoreless in the eight and ninth 
innings to earn their 16th win of the 
year and hand UCSD an embarrassÂ· 
ing loss. 

"Every team has its off days and 
this was just one of them," Morehead 

said. "Its just our job to minimize 
the bad days and bounce back from 
them with wins." 

The off day was due in large 
part to a Triton pitching staff that 
allowed the Seawolves J3 hits in 35 
at bats in the game for a .371 team 
batting average. PLNU also got a lot 
of help at the bottom of the order 
from Gill, who was 4Â·for-5 with two 
RBis and three runs. The Tritons, 
now 8Â· 6 overaJl, only batted .212 as 
a team and left five men on base in 
the 10 -run loss. 

The loss to Point Lorna came 
during a oneÂ· game vacation from 
Ca lifornia Collegiate Athletic 
Association play, in which the Tritons 
are 2-2. UCSD will return to league 
competition with a three-day, fourÂ· 
game home stand against Sonoma 
State on March 3 through 5. 

More'head said that the Tritons 
have lofty goals for the big home-
stand. 

"Our goal is always to win four 
games every weekend," he said. "But 
we're just goin& to take it one game 
at a time, pitch by pitch and focus on 
playing the game. The win column 
will take care of itself." 

Ruthless Competition In

â¢ GROUPIES, from page 16 
"marryÂ·mes" - those that want to 
be wives, among others, all of which 
makes you scratch your head in 
amusement and wonder. 
, But not every groupie is sleazy. 
Take, for example, Spike Lee, who 
has made it his personal mission to 
be a courtside fIXture at every New 
York Knicks game. He may not be 
your typicaJ image of a groupie -
but he's pertinently there schmooz-
ing with the players after the games 
and holds an extensive collection 
of Knicks memorabilia, enough to 
make anyone jealous. 

It was hard to pick my favorÂ· 
ite story from an Ozone Magazine 
article called "Groupie Confessions," 
which asked for groupies to anonyÂ· 
mously step forward with their 
stories about being with a famous 
celebrity. But I leave you with one 
quote that will make anyone's night 
complete: "I had a one-night stand

TURN FANS 
INTO GROUPIES 

I n light of the scantily clad woman at the recent NBA All-Star Game and the new Kid Rock and Scott 
tapp sex- tape video scandal , I was 

inspired to write about the oldest but 
most hush-hush unofficial sport of 
citizens everywhere: being a profes-
sional groupie. Being awe-struck by 
a celebrity doesn't take into account 
what gender you ,are, how old you 
are or where you are - going weak 
in the knees over seeing omeone 
famous is a symptom that affects 
LI S all. But how well you compose 
your elf or how far you put out to 

No Cup

pursue the chance encounter is what 
defines a groupie ho-fes ional from 
an awe-struck amateur. 

For tho e that refu e to look at 
this as a sport, I beg to differ. You 
have your uniform: For gi rls, it's 
usually cleavage up to the neck and 
your little sister's skirt (clear heels 
don't hurt either), while guys tend to 
sport jerseys and have their equip-
ment (Sharpie) in hand. Your game 
plan: flirting with the security guard 
to get backstage or fake pre s passes 
to get past the locker room doors. 

You have the legends, sllch 
as Karrine Steffans, author of 
"Confessions of a Video Vixen ," 
whose conquests include Shaq and 
Ja Rule among others, as well as the 
infamous gr~upies: Katelyn Faber, 
whose claim to fame is none other 
than Kobe Bryant - with the thou-
sands of groupies across the world, 
only a few come Ollt with some kind 
of souvenir. But whether it's money 
or a diamond necklace, everyone 
goes away with a story to teU to any-
one who will listen. 

But don't put the fault just on 
the groupies; it takes two to do this 
tango. Not every superstar is scotch 
clean, no matter what their appear-
ance may seem. Case-in -point: 
Ichiro Suzuki , probably the best 
Japanese import since Nintendo, 
whom Ken Griffey Jr. would like to 
kid "had not butt," has what seems 
to be a gleaming track record. But 
even Suzuki has a few skeletons in 
his closet: A couple years ago, the 
160-pound, married All-Star was 
bogged with rumors that he had 
made a lucrative monetary offer to a 
woman to silence her from stepping 
forward to the press and releasing 
details of their steamy affair. ' And 
who could forget the crazy stories 
about Magic Johnson's orgies that 
began to shed light to HIV aware-
ness in the early '90s? 

A 1998 Sports Illustrated arti -
cle even brought to the spotlight 
the high number of NBA players 
who had out-of-wedlock children. 
One of the biggest repeat offenders 
was Shawn Kemp, who has seven 
children with six different mothers. 
That's a lot of love to have to spread 
around. 

Some people even have terms 
fo r the different types of group-
ies that exist in the league: "lot 
lizards" - groupies that hang out 
in the parking lot; "camp groupies" 
- those that live near team training 
camps; "grandma groupies" - the 
40- and 50-year-old groupies; and

Men's Tennis Sweeps Pomona for First Win 

â¢ ALEXANDER VAROND/GUARDIAN 

Tritons end season-
opening six-game 
losing streak with 

.. . 

convlncmg WIn over 
Cal Poly Pomona. 

By Danai Leininger 
ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR 

Losing Six-straight match ups to 
begin a season is usualJy a cause for 
concern, but for the UCSD men's 
tennis team, optimism abounds. 

The Tritons captured their first 
victory of the season with a convinc-
ing 9-0 sweep of Cal Poly Pomona on 
Feb. 26, ending an otherwise winless 
February against decidedly daunt-
ing opponents. The team, which had 
played valiantly but fruitlessly for 
the greater part of the month, saw 
Its hard work payoff in straight-set 
victories in dominant Singles and 
strong doubles play. 

No.1 singles senior Brent Molden 
trounced the Broncos' Daniel Chang 
in an assertive 6-0, 6-0 finish , while 
No. 2 sophomore Eric Rubens 
defeated Sebastian Torres (6-1, 6 -
I) in similar fashion. Sophomore 
transfer Ramesh Thondapu regis-
tered a 6-3, 6-2 win over Danny 
Tran, the only Broncos player to win 
more than four games. 

the sweep with an 8-3 win over Dan 
Evangelista and Eric Carlstrom. 

Head coach Eric Steidl mayer, the 
winningest coach in UCSD men's 
tennis history, was pleased that his 
team's efforts had finally paid off. 

"It was definitely good to get the 
first win," Steidlmayer said. "We've 
been trying to get better by practic-
ing with a purpose, and the last two 
weeks we've done th'tt better:' 

The Tritons' impressive results 
against Pomona may be attributed 
to the team's six previous matches, 
in which five of the opponents were 
top Division-I programs. The team 
competed against D -I forces such 
as UC Riverside, San Diego State 
and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. The 
team only faced one other D-II team 
before its win, a great difference 
from the far easier schedule of the 
2005 season. In fact, UCSD suffered 
only seven losses in the entire 2005 
season, but many of the opponents 
were from D-II squads. 

According to Steidlmayer, the 
plan to schedule matches against 
top-tier D -I teams was premedi-
tated. 

"We have a really young team this 
year, and we're trying to get them 
seasoned and more experienced:' 
Steidlmayer said. "We're playing 
teams with players that have been in 
tougher situations, and it's getting us 
ready for the next months ." 

Meister, who outshined Wang 6-
I, 6-2, views the grueling schedule 
as a crucial way to gauge the team's 
ability and raise the level of play. 

"These teams will battle for every 
point in every game:' Meister said. 
"We knew it was going to be chal-
lenging from the beginning, and 

Senior Brent Molden swept the Broncos' Daniel Chang in his No.1 singles match and toomed 
up with senior Steven Oechel for an 8-5 doubles win in the Tritons' !HJ victory on Feb. 26. 

In doubles play, senior Erik 
Oijala and sophomore Blake Meister 
put down Chang and Tyrone Wang's 
effort, and cruised to an 8-2 win. 
In the closest match of the series, 
Molden and senior Steven Oechel, 
who recently came back Â·from an 
injury, dealt Torres and Dustin 
Andolsen. an 8-5 defeat. The No. 3 
doubles team of Rubens and fresh -
man Kazumi Negishi rounded out [ TENNIS, page 14]

defeat at the hands of the Tritons 
earlier in the season, avenging their 
9-6 loss in UCSD's season-opener 
with a 14-4 win on March 1. 

Originally scheduled for Feb. 28 
but postponed due to rain, the game 
started with the Tritons scoring the 
first run in the second inning after 
senior centerfielder Damian Fante 
took one for the team, then stole 
second after his free pass. Fante 
would come around to score on 
sophomore third baseman Chris 
Hom's double down the right field 
line. 

After doing a stellar job in the 
top of the first, senior starting 
pitcher T.e. Geach (2- 1) returned 
to the hill to protect the Tritons' 
slim lead but could not retire a 
batter before giving up three runs 
on two-straight Singles and a home 
run to open the inning. Facing a 
3- 1 deficit after the three-run blast, 
Geach retired the next Seawolf bat-
ter but found himself in another 
jam with men on second and third 
and one out. Geach managed to 
escape the inning two batters later 
but gave up one more run on a 
groundout to put the Tritons down 
by three runs. 

The Seawolves expanded their 
lead one inning later after a quiet 
UCSD half of the third. After giv-
ing up four runs in two innings, 

the beleaguered Geach was in need 
of assistance and junior reliever 
Michael Kearney was the Triton for 
the job. Kearney cruised through 
the first two batters but gave up a 
home rtin to sophomore third base-
man Jesse Gill to put the Tritons 
deeper in the hole. 

Another uneventful inning for 
UCSD gave the Seawolves a chance 
to expand their lead in Kearney's 
second inning of work. Kearney 
began the bottom of the fourth by 
striking out junior outfielder Travis 
Wiley and fOIcing a lineout from 
the next batter. However, Point 

Lorna mounted another two-out 
rally and scored two more runs on 
two RBI singles. 

The cycle of the Seawolves' stel-
lar pitching and powerful Seawolf 
offense continued in the fifth inning 
as Jared Eskew (4-1) maintained his 
dominance over an anemic Triton 
offense. AlIeady with a command-
ing 7-1 lead, the Seawolves did not 
hold back and scored three more 
runs in the bottom of the fifth 
inning off of senior pitcher Jose 
Navarro, the starter in the Tritons 
season-opening victory over the 
same Seawolves. 

It took a nine-run deficit to get 
the attention of the Triton offense, 
which finally came alive with two 
runs in the top of the sixth inning. 
The sudden outburst could have 
come because of junior reliever 
Shane Kochon's replacement of 
Eskew, who only allowed two UCSD 
hits and struck out eight batters in 
his five innings of work. Whatever 
the reason, the Tritons put togeth-
er the two-run rally on back-to-
back homers by junior shortstop 
Jonathan Erickson and junior first
