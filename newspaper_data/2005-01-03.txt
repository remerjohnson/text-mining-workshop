UCSD received a grade of"B-" 
for its tobacco-free policies, while 
seven other colleges in the area 
earned failing grades, according to 
a new "repon card" released by the 
American Lung Association of San 
Diego and Imperial Counties. 

The first-of-its-kind evalua-
tion judged the extent to which 13 
local coUege campuses discour-
aged student tobacco use. The 
study was conducted in panner-

ship with the Tobacco-Free 
Communities Coalition, with par -
tial funding from the Cali forn ia 
Department of Health Services. 

"Tn titution of higher learning 
are excellent targets for big-tobac-
co donations and funded research," 
ALA health educator Susanna 
Concha-Gtrcia stated in an e-mail.

Government mulls student database 
UC worries system threatens individual privacy 

By AMY IFURUNG 
Staff Writer 

The University of California has 
expressed student-privacy appre-
hensions over the federal govern-
ment's new plan to collect and 
maintain detailed information on 
college srudents across the nation. 

T he proposal recommends the 
creation of a detailed database of 
enrollment records for aU college 
students, including such informa-
tion as individual names and social 
security numbers. 

"The university definitely has 
concerns in relation to invasions 
of privacy," said Brigitte Donner, 
communications coordinator at 
the University of California's fed-
eral government relations office in 
Washington, D.C. "There's still a 
lot of uncertainty regarding exact-

Iy what data will be:: coUected." 
Current government records 

only contain information on indi-
viduals receiving federal financial 
aid - and lack aU identifiable infor-
mation, like names. Higher educa-
tion institutions also disclose gener-
al information about enrollment, 
financial aid and graduation rates. 

In addition to the university, 
several higher-education groups 
have also voiced concerns over the 
proposed new database. Those 
opposed to the proposal include 
the Nationa l Association of 
Independent Colleges and 
U niversities, and the United 
States Student Association, the 
largest and oldest snident coa li-
tion in the nation. 

"This proposal would take 
away the little bit of protection 
that students currently have,"

USSA Legislative Director 
Jasmine L. Harris said, referring 
to a current federal law that pro-
tects student educational records. 

Under the Family Educational 
Rights and Privacy Act, schools 
may disclose information on sm-
dents without consent only under 
specific conditions - when it is 
requested in accordance with a 
judicial order or subpoena, for 
example. The new proposal would 
launch across-the-board data col-
lection that can currently only 
occur in cenain circumstances on 
a student-by-student basis. 

The new proposal will allow 
the Nationa l Center for 
Education Statistics at the 
Depa rtment of Education to 
receive information on students 
regardless of consent. 

"Students don 't have the ability 
to opt out of this," Harris said. 
"They have no choice in the mat-
ter, and that's a cause for concern." 

However, supporters of the 
database say it would correct a 
procedural flaw in the ' depart-
ment's existing system for gather-
ing statistics: Students who trans-
fer schools are recorded both as 
dropouts from their old campuses 
and as new enroUments at their 
second coUeges.

Court overturns

Ruling leaves universities in

In a 2-to- 1 decision , the fede r-

found the Solomon Amendment 
- a federal law that compel uni-

recruiters or risk losing fed eral

The Philadelphia-based appeals

bar recruiters if the miljtary's 
"don 't ask, don 't tell" hjring policy 
violates university principles of 
nondiscrimination based on sexual

"To comply with the Solomon 

Amendment, the law schools must 
affi rmatively assist milita ry 
recruiters .. . which means they 
must propagate, accommodate and 
subsidize the military's message," 
the coun's opinion stated in the

I BRIEFLY 
Murphy certified winner in 

San Diego mayoral race 
San Diego Mayor Dick Murphy was swom in 

for his second term as the city's top executive 
after the county registrar certified him as the win-
ner of a protracted recount in the Nov. 2 election. 

Murphy led City Councilwoman Donna Frye 
- whose last minute write-in campaign attract-
ed international attention - by sligntiy more 
than 2,000 votes, according to official results. 

However, a separate recount commissioned 
by Southern California media organizations 
showed that approximately 5,000 additional 
ballots were marked with Frye's name but were 
not counted because voters did not fill in the 
write-in bubble, as required under state law. 

Though Frye did not publicly announce 
whether she would appeal the results, her Web 
site urges supporters to contribute "financial 
resources for a legal and campaign team~ Frye 
supporters have until Jan. 7 to appeal the certified 
election resu\ts. 

Faculty to vote on changes 
for college athletics 
Facul~ representatives from 28 universities 

with leading sports programs will cast votes on 
rules that will eliminate athletic scholarships 
and call for tougher academic standards for stu-
dent athletes. 

At a January meeting. members of the Council 
on Intercollegiate Athletics will debate a proposal 
urging the NCAA to take steps to shorten the 
lengths of some sports seasons and to elevate 
minimum grades and admission requirements for 
students who participate in campus sports. 

The organization includes representatives 
from faculty senates of NCAA Division IA uni-
versities, which are one notch below the 
league's top Division I schools. 

"None of the values ascribed to college 
sports can be realized if we abandon the prin-
ciple that personal development through ath-
letics participation and academic achievement 
are linked," the COlA draft resolution states. 

If approved, the document would call on 
university administrators to do away with schol-
arships based solely on athletic abilities. In addi-
tion, the proposal calls for NCAA bylaw changes 
and adoption of "best practices' that would 
force the association to collect grade informa-
tion from individual campuses to evaluate their 
academic integrity and ban coaches from teach-
ing classes. 

The reforms are necessary to reversp poli-
cies that encourage "college aspirants to priori-
tize sports over academics" and "let their ath-
letics commitment undermine their academic 
work," the d raft states.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, JANUARY 3, 2005 

If approved at COlA's national meeting on 
Jan. 6 and Jan. 7, the resolution would be sym-
bolic and not bind NCAA to any actions. 

Fonner student found ~ilty 
for A.S. Coondl disruption 
Members of the John Muir College Judicial 

Board voted to convict former MUir student 
Bryan Barton of four student conduct violations 
stemming from his disruption of a May 2004 
AS Council meeting. 

At the time, Barton and a group of 20 
masked students - armed with loaded Super 
Soakers and water balloons - brought a goat 
into the meeting and proclaimed that the coun-
cil was facing a "coup~ 

In place of the A.S. Council, Barton had said 
that he and the goat would serve as co-execu-
tives of a new student govemment to be 
formed aher the coup. 

After the unidentified students threw water 
balloons at members of the council - Barton 
did not throw balloons or fire water guns him-
self - several councilmembers retaliated with 
spare water balloons Jnd a bowl of salad. 

A UCSD police officer initially detained 
Barton, but released him aher the council 
declined to file charges. 

The judicial boarQ found that Barton's con-
duct included behavior that "threatens the health 
of safety of any person, including one's self: dis-
nupted ' teaching. research, administration, the 
disciplinary process or ... other university activi-
ties: disturbed the peace and created hazardous 
conditions, Muir Dean of Student Affairs Patricia 
Mahaffey wrote to Barton in a Dec. 6 letter. 

The hearing was held behind closed doors 
and Mahaffey did not disclose how individual 
board members voted. 

As sanctions, the board voted to suspend 
the former Koala editor from campus through 
the end of spring quarter and prohibited him 
from officially graduating until fall 2005. 

Though he was scheduled to graduate last 
spring. administrators banned Barton from 
attending the Muir graduation, forcing him 
instead to sneak into the Revelle College cere-
mony for the sake of family members who trav-
eled across the state to attend, Barton said. 

In response to the board's decision, Barton 
said he has filed an appeal with Muir interim 
Provost Susan Kirkpatrick and requested 
administrators to allow an independent tally of 
judicia l board members' final vote on the case. 

"I shall fight the UCSD administration even 
when fi re and water have forgotten enmity, 
even when lion and lamb have leamed to lie 
together in peace, even when the division of 
light and dark has been forgotten: Barton said. 
"I will fight their injustice even after time itself 
ceases to be.'

MONDAY,JANUARY 3,2005 THE UCSD OUARDIAN 

Grade: Schools criticize grading methods 
continued from page I 

dent groups, as well as an evalua-
tion on more than two dozen 
grading criteria. 

"We applaud the institutions 
with high grades and we are 
hearing from some other cam· 
puses that they will move for-
ward quickly to establish policies 
that will improve the health of 
tens of thousands of students," 
said regional ALA Vice President 
for Government Relations Debra 
Kelley in a Dec. 3 announce-
ment. 

UCSD received a perfect score 
for campus enforcement of smok-
ing rules and regulations but lost 
points for a lack of protection of 
community members and a lack of 
reduction of second-hand smoke 
exposure. For example, outdoor 
dining patios on campus do not 
have smoke-free areas, and park-
ing lots are not smoke· free, 
according to the report card. 

The campus also lost points for 
accepting research funding from 
tobacco companies and for failing 
to prohibit the sale of tobacco 
products on campus. 

"The UCSD [General Store] 
co-op still sells tobacco on campus," 
Concha-Garcia stated. "There are 
large incentives to sell cigarettes, 
such as the high profit margin made 
on tobacco sales, the tobacco com-
panies' reimbursement for in-store 
displa}'!i and reimbursements of the 
store for lost or stolen tobacco mer-
chandise." 

Campus spokesman Barry 
Jagoda said the university 
acknowledges the importance of 
the ALAS study. 

"UCSD does a good job of dis-
couraging smolOng, but there's 
always room for improvement, 
and some of the issues in the 
American Lung Association's 
report may deserve further study," 
Jagoda sa.id. 

Smoking went up on university 
campuses nationwide from 22.3 
percent of students in 1993 to 28.5 
percent in 1998, a r2te higher than 
that of all adults, according to ALA. 

Citing concerns about 
increased tobacco usage among 
the young adult population, the 
ALA received funding in 2001 to 
develop the report card. In March 
2004, the ALA sent letters notify-
ing colleges of the grading criteria 
and forecasting their scores. The 
schools were then given a chance 
to verify and update their data and 
to modify or adopt new tobacco-
free policies . The final grades 
were announced in November. 

Representatives from some of 
the "failing" college campuses, 
however, have cited errors in the 
~report. 

"We were not awarded points 
in ten areas that we clearly have a 
practice [or) procedure in place to 
reduce the exposure to tobacco or 
to encourage the cessation of the 
use of tobacco," San Diego City 
College Director of 
Administrative Services Carol 
Dexheimer stated in an e-mail. "I 
think the reporting errors 
occurred because the 'reporter' 
did not contact a representative of 
City College ... I don't know how 
or who came up with the inaccu-
rate information that resulted in 
the reported 'F. '" 

Concha-Garcia, however, 
defended the ALAS reporting pro-
cedures. 

"TIlls is the first report card of 
its kind, rating the college and 
university campuses in San Diego 
County," she stated. "The report 
card was set up to analyze the pol-
icy and college characteristics 
unique to each setting. What hap-
pened is that campus administra-
tors who communicated with the 
ALA early on fared better than 
those who waited until the fall."

A new report card for the

nization said. 

"All the campuses that received

they are serious about improving 
their grades by furnishing com-
plete information and worlOng 
with us to understand how col· 
leges can be a tobacco-resistant

"My report focuses on under-
graduate education. as separated 
from graduate education and facul-
ty research," said Schwartz, who 
successfully sued the UC Board of 
Regents to gain access to data on 
employee pensions and has often 
been critical of the regents. "My 
number is so much less than official 
UC statements because they bun-
dle all those other missions togeth-

picture." 

However, UC 
Office of the

stated. 
"Research and teaching are both 

important functions - which 3 
public research university performs 
for the public good," he said . "The 
state used to pay for all of lhat . 
Now some cost is being shifted to 
undergraduate students - to pay 
for their own education. But they 
should not be required to pay also 
for the other public functions that 
UC provides." 

The issue of student fees is 
growing more urgent because of 

President spokes· 
woman Ravi 
Poorsina criticized 
Schwartz's numbers, 
saying that calculat· 
ing the cost of atten-
dance for one student 
was not possible with 
the data available. 

[Schwartz) assumes 
a lot of data because 

he doesn't have 

impending hikes. 
Schwartz said . 
When the 8-per-
cent fee raise 
approved by the 
regents for next 
year is taken into 
account, the bur-
den on under-
graduates will be 
at or above 100 
percent of what 
their education 
actually costs. 
Schwartz said . 

"[Schwartz] has 
come up with anoth-
er calculation that's 
based on a lot of 

access to a lot of it. "

assumptions," 
Poorsina told the Daily Bruin. "He 
assumes a lot of data because he 
doesn't have access to a lot of it." 

The importance of UC faculty 
research has created a rift of 
understanding between faculty and 
public minds, Schwartz stated in 
his report. While faculty members 
have been most valued for their 
research activities, the public is 
most concerned about the under-
graduate education provided to 
students. However, state budget 
problems have resulted in legisla-
tive cuts to university budgets, 
which forced UC universities to 
raise student fees in hopes of 
recovering lost revenue, Schwartz 

"I think that is 
unconsciona ble." 

Schwartz. said. "At leasl UC should 
be honest and say where their money 
goes - thaI means. accept my calcu-
lation or provide their own." 

Poorsina said the university 
could not provide an exact estimate 
of per-student costs. 

Schwartz' analysis was based on 
economic logic and official UC 
data provided in university publica-
tions, he said. 

"[ have asked UC officials to 
meet wiril me if they disbelieve any 
part of my work. I'm still waiting 
for a response," Schwartz said .

University needs to make 
• Investments transparent 

By BRYAN TSAO 
Opinion Editor 

I n 2002, scandals at Enron, MCl Worldcom and Tyco revealed corporate America's 
dirty secret: CEOs at many pub-
licly traded companies doctored 
their books to make their compa-
nies look more profitable than 
they really were, often triggering 
lucrative performance bonuses 
that made ' them richer than they 
already were. Thanks to the 
efforts of state attorney generals 
around the nation, many of those 
executives are now standing trial 
for their actions. However, the 
silent accomplices who allowed 
the financial hijinks to take place 
have gone mostly unnoticed: these 
companies' negligent boards of 
directors, who are supposed to 
oversee the company. 
Unfortunately, at 
these com-
panies, 
greedy 
CEOs 
were able 
10 fill 
corporate 
board-
rooms with 
I h e i r 
friend and 
colleag ues, 
com pl e t e ly 
dcfcatl11g the 

purpose of having an independent 
oversight entity. 

Now, one doesn't normally 
think of corporate finance as a 
pressing issue for an institution 
like the University of California. 
However, with the university 
responsible for investing $59 bil-
lion in pension and endowment 
funds through the Office of the 
President, how the school invests 
and manages its money greatly 
impacts both students and soci-
ety. Following the scandals, 
Congress swi ftly passed the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which, 
among other things, empowered 
smaller shareholders by allowing 
them to nominate members to 
companies' board of directors. 
Thus, the university should do its 
part to improve corporate gover-
nance by ensuring that the votes 

it con troIs through its stock 
investments are used 

properly. 
In addition, 

buying stock in a 
company is an 

implicit show 
of support for 
it. In recent 
years, many 
investors 
have been 
adopting 

Eugene WoJ/Cuordion 

responsible inve ting," whi ch 
means avoiding tobacco compa-
nies, gaming and casino compa-
nies, environmentally damaging 
companies and companies with 
unfair labor practices. As a public 
entity, the University of California 
should do what's best for both stu-
dents and society as whole, and 
that means adopting such an 
investment strategy. 

Of course, it's possible that the 
university is already doing so -
but there's no way to know. 
Unfortunately, the university pub-
lishes precious little information 
about the money it's investing on 
behalf of students and emproyces. 
The Office of the Treasurer 
(http://www, !ICOp . edu/tr(aJurer) , 
which manages these funds, does a 
good job of publishing data 
regarding how much money is 
invested and how much money it 
makes, but says little about what 
stocks the company actually owns. 
Click on a link that says "portfo-
lios" and you get a list of things 
like "ARC LC GROWfH," 
"CGT CORE" and "FRANKLIN 
PORTFOLIO LC CORE." 
Unless you' re one of the few stu-
dents at the Rady School of 
Management, that probably does-
n't mean a lot to you. 

Gi ven the a moun t of money at 
stake and the large economic and 
social impact that money has in 
the marketplace, the chool needs 

to do a better job of being 
transparent and accountable 

for its investments . 
Theoretically, the 
school could be 
investing our 

money in cigarette-
producing sweatshops 

that also dump toxic 
waste into rivers 

and kill baby 
seals. To the 

students, the 
univers ity 'S 

as 
opaque as 
Enron's. 

While it's 
unlikely that 

the university is 
cheating students out of 

millions of dollars through 
bogus investments, the Office 
of the President should still 
do a better job of making 
information about its invest-

ments available to the pub-
lic, in a form more 

understandable than 
financial gibber-

ish.

al LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
All departments 

underfunded 
Dear Editor: 

In the Nov. 22 article about 
graduate student pay ("Pay for 
graduate tudents varies among 
departments, report says"), I was 
unfortunately misquoted by 
Christine Kwon. Creative cutting 
and pasting allowed Kwon to make 
my comments seem as though I 
was criticizing the math depart-
ment. My original, unedited state-
ments were made to explain the 
logistics behind the disparity and 
not as a moral judgment on which 
departments were "better." 

I am fu lly supportive of every 
academic department at UCSD. 
Each department brings an impor-
tant thread to the colorful tapestry 
of academic knowledge at our 
institution . All departments are 
underfunded relative to their true 
value to UCSD and beyond. To 
make up the difference, graduate 
students are used as cheap labor. 
Departments that bring in more 
money through grants underpay 
their graduate students less than 
departments that are unable to 
bring in as much grant money. 
Although some graduate students 
are better off than others, 1 thi nk

Science classes 
taught tougher 

Dear Editor: 
This letter is in response to a 

letter written to the editor on 
Nov. 29, titled "Nonscicnce 
majors important too." I com-
pletely agree with the statement 
that no major is "inherently" 
harder than another. However, 
this is not reflected in how classes 
are taught at UCSD or any other 
institution as such. 

In the response, the point was 
emphasized that just because one 
is a non-math/science major, it 
cannot be concluded that one has 
difficulty with math/science, 
which is a valid point. But this 
stigma applies to math/science 
majors too: We don't all have dif-
ficulty with social science topics 
or writing; which brings me to my 
next point. 

Yes, some math/science 
majors are extremely lacking in 

their English capabilities, but 
some just chose a career path in 
the direction of Olath or science. 
~utomatically, however, all 
math/science majors are written 
off ' as tho e who have troubl e 
writing, which is extremely

and are expected to do just as

But non-math/science majors 
have "nonscience" science classes 

and they have "nonscience and

neither types of majors are morc

Column: 'Year in Review'

concinued from page 5 
new year as an opportunity to real-
ly better themselves, they wouldn't 
want to spill the results of some 
serious soul-searching to anyone 
who asks. Take this hypothetical 
conversation. 

"So, what's your New Year's res-
olution?" 

"I'm going to try to MOp cheat-
ing on my girlfriend." 

"Jesus Christ; you've been 
cheating on your girlfriend? You're 
a m07lster!" 

See? Being honest just sets you 
up for a lot of pain 
and embarrass-
ment, so the 

from the distant horizon. Wait, 
did I say "charmed"? I meant 

~painfully hypnotized." December 
is used as an excuse for the news-
papers to ignore all the news that's 
fit to print and instead print all the 
tluff that's fit for a 7-year-old's 
diary: "The Year's Top Movies 
You Didn't See'''; "The Year's Top 
Ten Movies You Did See, But 
Immediately Wished You 
Hadn't!"; "The Year's Top TV 
Shows We Got Paid to 
Promote!"; "The Yea r's Top 
Vegan Quiche Reci pes'" 

T he possibili-
ties fo r I ists are 

unspoken rule of 
New Year's reso-
lutions becomes: 
Be as banal and 
inoffensive as pos-
sible. This rule 
renders unaccept-
able the resolu-
tions we should be 
making, and 
instead whittles 
down acceptable 
resolutions to a 
small few, such as: 

Call ~ a party 
pooper, but if I had 

a late,night 
hankering far a IV 
personality way past 

his prime, I'd just 
watch Jay Lena." 

endless, and 
they're all painful 
to read, not to 
mention use less. 
Newspapers only 
print them because 
they're fun to write 
(they give the 
reporters a break 
from the drudgery 
and legwork of 
actual reporting), 
they fill a lot of 
space and they give 

"I'm going to be 
more responsible with money"; 
"I'm going to be more apprecia-
tive of the people I love"; "I'm 
going to lose weight"; "I'm going 
to make the call that could save 
me 15 percent or more on car 
insurance. " 

And the last step: Abandoning 
your chosen resolution (feel free to 
choose from the list above; I won't 
mind) in two minutes - three min-
utes, if you're a real go-getter. 
Would you like to join the millions 
of people who haven't lost an OUllce 
of weight after resolving to slim 
down onJan. I? Hop aboard! 

But for better or for worse 
(okay, worse), this resolution busi-
ness isn't the only sign that the new 
year and all its corresponding 
responsibilities (okay, olle responsi-
bility: buying a new calendar) are 
upon us. 

I'm always charmed by the 
legions of "This Year's Top ... " 
and "Year in Review" compilations 
put out by news programs, news-
papers and other periodicals as 
soon as January waves its arms 

newspapers a rea-
son to print Paris 

Hilton 's mug over a quarter of the 
page. 

But let's not forget the last 
charming feature of the New 
Year 's holiday: the Times Square 
pageantry, kindly watched over by 
the spirit of Dick C lark (or Regis 
Philbin - whoever 's not incapac-
itated by a stroke). For some rea-
son, people find the ew York 
Ball Drop so enthralling, year 
after year after year, that they 
invariably switch it on during 
New Year's Eve parties. Ooh, fun ! 
Let's all sip Martinelli's cider and 
watch TV, as if that's not any dif-
ferent from any other night of the 
year! Call me a party pooper, but 
if I had a late-night hankering for 
a TV personality way past his 
prime, I'd JUSt watch J ay Leno. 

But maybe r just need to widen 
my scope of what I find entertain-
ing. Heck, that could be my ew 
Year's resolution. 

I resolve to most likeiy igtlo1"t YOli if

MONDAY, JANUARY 3, Z005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

. Ruling: Congressman urges government appeal 
continued from page I 

large part on a Supreme Court 
decision issued in 2000, which 
allowed Boy Scouts to ban openly 
gay scoutmasters for portraying a 
lifestyle inconsistent with the Scout 
message. Likewise, universiues 
have the right to ban military 
recruiters whose "don't ask, don't 
tell" policy is inconsistent with the 
university's message, the Court of 
Appeals ruled. 

"The military can't just do any-
thing it wants, going into a private 
organization saying hel p us .. . or 
suffer a huge financial penalty," 
said Sharon Frase, one of the 
attorneys representing the plain-
tiff challenging the federal law. 
"LGBT students are promised not 
to be discriminated against at the 
university. Saying that if you're 
not straight, then we don't want 
you goes against that principle." 

Judge RuggeroJ. Aldisert, how-
ever, disagreed with the majority 
ruling. 

"No court heretofore has ever 
declared unconstitutional on First 
Amendment grounds any congres-
sional statute specifically designed 
to support the military," Aldisert 
stated in a dissenting opinion. 
"The interest of protecting the 
national security of the United 
States outweighs the indirect and 
attenuated interest of the law 
school 's speech." 

The case was filed by the Forum 
for Academic and Institutional 
Rights, a coalition composed of 26 
law schools, including Harvard and 
New York University, against the 
Department of Defense. 

The Department of Justice, 
which defended the government's 
position on the case, has not pub-
licly said whether it plans to appeal 
the decision. A spokesman for the 
department did not return calls 
seeking comment. 

Decision's impact uncertain 
Since the court's ruling, several 

schools, including Harvard Law 
School, have banned military 
recruiters from campus facili ties. 

Because rulings made by the 
Third Circuit have no legal juris-
diction in California, the effect of 
the court's ruling on UC campuses 
remains ambiguous. 

"A court case in the third dis-
trict impacts only those institu-
tions," the university'S 
Washington spokesman Chris 
Harrington said. wAithough a sim-
ilar case could come forward, this 
particular case doesn't impact our 
policies." 

UCSD has historically facilitat-
ed on-campus recruiting. Former 
UC President David Gardner 
determined the military'S hiring 
policy for gay servicemen defensi-
ble under university nondiscrimi-
nation regulations in 1983 . 

"Obvious discrimination that is 
blatant we have issues with," 
Career Services Center Director 
Andrew Ceperley said. "Sexual ori-
entation doesn't come up because 
it's not appropriate for an employer 
to ask a student whether he [or she] 
is gay or lesbian ... [therefore] 
'don't ask, don't tell' is acceptable 
by law, currently." 

However, the Solomon 
Amendment and the threat of los-
ing federal dollars may have an 
important intluence on this policy, 
he said. 

"With the Solomon 
Amendment, we are looking at a 
particular exception [to university 
policies]," Ceperley said. "1 would 
suspect, as a state system, that [fed-
eral aid] is a major factor in how it 
plays out." 

However, with the court's deci-
sion deeming the federal law unen-
forceable in its East Coast region 
and the potential for more chal-

lenges in other circuits, military 
recruitment on campus may once 
again become a key issue at the uni-
versity. 

"This is going to be explicitly 
on the radar," said Steve Rosen, a 
university attorney at the 
University of California's Office of 
the General Counsel. wWe are cur-
rently preparing a memo explain-
ing the open legal issues to the 
[UC] president." 

Lawmaker calls for appeal 
In 1996, Congress passed the 

Solomon Amendment, granting 
the Secretary of Defense the right 
to deny Department of Defense 
funds to any university that pro-
hibited ROTC or military recruit-
ment on campus. A year later, 
Congress expanded the penalty to 
include funds administered by 
other federal agencies, including 
the Departments of 
Transportation, Labor, Health 
and Education. 

Although the Solomon 
Amendment became law under the 
Clinton administration, it began to 
be strictly enforced after the attacks 
of Sept. 11,2001. 

Rep. Richard Pombo (R-Calif.), 
one of the law's co-sponsors at the 
time, urged the government to 
appeal the court's decision in a let-
ter to Defense Secretary Donald 
Rumsfeld and outgoing Attorney 
General John Ashcroft. 

"It is the military that ensures 
the freedoms of college faculty and 
students to voice their opinions in 
our open and free society," Pombo 
stated. "This is a case in which twO 
misguided judges made a mockery 
of our judicial system by exerting 
their personal political agendas into 
their ruling."

- Judge Thomas L. Ambra, opinion of the court 

\ · YfS~n ' 
.' !'k What d1~ me ~11y and as a judge is that 

, ,tlWftawlc:hOofl Mm to oppro«h this question as an ace-
demk·txef(jse,a question on a eonstitutionollaw exam-
ination or a moat c:ourt topic, with no thought of the effect 
of "*' odion on. .... supP,y of military ~ers and mili-
tary (udges in the operation of the Uniform Code of

Theie is no explanation, however, why the law schools 
COMider it important to hove private national law firms 
come to campu& and boost about firsf-.yeor associates' 
darietand s1gni~ bonuses and emphasize that if the 

, sludentt wont to clerk far a federal judge for a year, the 
finn WIll Odd another bonus. 

This fs not anly 01( for the private sector, but also it's 
. good for the loW school. But we don't want military 
recruiter, to ~ our students. No, say the law schools, 

. whor, sauce for the private sedor goose is not sauce for 
the military gonder. No, soy the low schools, we don't 
need a leVel playing field; let the military shift for them-

lobby split 

over proposal 
continued from page I 

which include several higher-edu-
cation lobbying groups, said that 
more detai led information is need-
ed to hold colleges and universities 
accountable for student achieve-
ment. 

"The limitations of existing 
data systems prevent institutions 
from fully examining the progress 
of their students through the high-
er education ystcm," tated 
Edward M. Elmendorf, the 
American Association of State 
Colleges and U niversities' vice 
president of government and poli-
cy analysis, in a letter to members 
of the HOllse of Representatives. 
"Current accountability systems 
fail to caprure the full measure of 
student progress and success on 
our campuses." 

In addition to the AASCU, the 
American Council of Education 
and the Stale I Tigher Education 
Executive Officers Association 
both expressed support for the 
plan, which was first reported by 
the ChroniC/, of Higher Education. 

The new data collection 
method would "improve account-
ability for rudent success, enhance 
consumer information avai lable to 
prospective students and other 
stakeholders and enable a more 
robust evaluation of federa l stu-
dent financia l aid programs," 
Elmendorf stated . 

Calls and e-mails to a 
Deparrment of Education 
spokesman seeking comment were 
not returned. 

The proposal is only in the dis-
cussion stage, and the new data-
base would require approvaJ from 
Congress. If a formal proposal is 
made, and in turn approved, 
NCES will conduct a trial of the 
system with 1,500 colleges during 
the 2006-07 school year. Based on 
the results of the trial run, the sys-
tem would then spread nationally.

Friday Night Lights 
Price Center Theater, 

6&9pm 
Based on the boolc by H.G_ Bissinger, FRIDAY NIGHT 
LIGHTS chronicles the entire 1988 football season of the 
Pennian High Panthers of Odessa, Texas, with players, 
coaches, mothers, fathers, boosters, fans and families 
snuggling with ongoing personal conflicts while the team 
fights for a state championship. In depicting the daily 
grind of coach Gary Gaines' winning team and the poten-
tial destinies of its individual players, the story paints a 
vivid portrait of Odessa (and places lilce it all across 
America) where, once a weelc during the fall, the town and 
its dreams come alive beneath the dazzling and disorient-
ing Friday night lights. With Billy Bob Thornton and 
Derelc Luie, directed by Peter Berg_ Ticlc.ets $3_

5th Avenue hot spots in downtown San Diego's 
Gaslamp Quarter heat things up on cold winter nights 

I t is tha~ time.again to forget troubl~s of . the dally grmd and dance the mght away. One of the best places in the area 
to explore San Diego nightlife is down-
town, in the heart of the Gaslamp Quarter. 
Three fabulous nightclubs, all conveniently 
located along 5th Avenue, provide a variety 
of music, drinks, lights and glamour: The 
Blue Tattoo, 5ifth Qtr. Bar & Grill and the 
Bitter End. Each has a cover charge, but 
this only attests to how clean, classy and 
dazzling these clubs are_ Also be fore-
warned that parking may be an issue, 
although there are plenty of horse-drawn 
carriages to go around. Sure, they are cost-
ly, but they save people's feet for the dance 
floor. 

The Blue Tattoo, located at 835 5th Ave., 
is an underground nightclub that features 
music sponsored by the local radio station 
Jammin' Z90. The DJs spin Top 40, hip-
hop and R&B hits on Thursday nights and 
trendy techno on Friday and Saturday 
nights, which keeps the dance floor mov-
ing. The club also requires a cover charge 
that varies from night to night. A dress 
code is enforced as well, so, guys, be pre-
pared to toss those old jeans aside and grab 
a pair of slacks. As for the ladies, a classy 
dress or slacks will do. Upon entering the 
club, a coat check is available for $2 per 
item and is a guaranteed safe storage place 
for jackets, purses and wallets. 

The club features a dance floor sur-
rounded by tables and chairs for mingling 
as well as numerous bars stocked with rea-

sonably 
drinks. On 
Wednesdays, 
drinks are $2.50 
and shots are $1, 
good for the club-
ber on a budget. 
The club staff 
flaunts a big-city 
attitude that draws 
a very cliquey 
crowd_ Also, be 
prepared for a lot 
of people in a 
small space. 
Nevertheless, it is 
easy to lose one-
self within the 
mist, strobe lights 
and music. So 
choose a night to 
put the books 
down, take a break . 
and blow off some 
steam at the Blue 
Tattoo. 

Another fre-
quented club Anna MilcMurdo/Guan/ian 
downtown is 5ifth lbe 5ifth Qtr: DJs spin a variety of hip-hop. trance and techno music nightly and live entertainment 
Qtr. Bar & Grill is offered throughout the week at this spacious dub, located at 600 5th Ave. 
located at 600 5 th 
Ave. This club provides a full menu and a 
variety of drinks offered at reasonable 
price. Though not as strict in regard to the 
dress code, the club still requires a cover 
charge that varies from night to night. 

Inside, an 
impressive 
display of 
televisions 
behind the 
bar displays 
ongoing 
screen savers 
that create the 
atmosphere. 
The club is 
street level 
with tables 
outside and 
inside with a 
dance floor 
located to the 

. left upon 
entrance. 
Waitresses 
offer vodka 

with fruit juice for $2 a shot and $3 bottles 
of beer. The music is great - three DJs 
playa variety of hip-hop and techno, and 
on some nights, the club provides live 
entertainment. The DJs are up on a stage 
where people are free to dance as well. The 
light show and fog are perpetual and the 
crowd is great. Everyone is there to have a 
good time. This club is highly recommend-
ed - it is clean, spacious and a great place 
to meet people_ The music is loud, but. 
there are tables outside that provide a place 
to chat and get to know that special some-
one. This awesome club is worth hitting 
again and again. 

Last but not least is the Bitter End, 
located at 770 5th Ave. The Bitter End is 
housed in a building over 125 years old, 
making it one of the Gaslamp's oldest. 
There is a $5 cover charge on T hursdays 
after 9:30 p.m., $10 on Friday and Saturday 
nights after 8:30 p.m. and free all other 
nights. A coat check is provided as well in 
the restrooms on the main floor for $5 per

Learn to get ahead 
with beHer foreplay 
U sefid tricks to improve oral 

and manual sex on men 

The Sex 
Guardian 

Lillian Nedwick 

Guys seem lilce they're real easy, don't they? To get off, I mean. Supposedly, it just 
takes a few rubs with their own 
hmds, a few more rubs with the 
partner's hand - or perhaps a few 
licks from willing lips - and they're 
quite orgasmically satisfied, Well, 
first of aU, although this may be true 
for most, it is certainly not true for 
alL Secondly, even if it were true that 
all men could easily be satisfied with-
in a few minutes, it would be 
absolutely no excuse for making 
those experiences less than 
mediocre. So, today's question arises: 
How can the lover make a blow job 
or a hand job something more than 
just more complicated masrurbation 
sessions? (I'll address the vagina in 
another issue.) 

your man go wild in bed. Usually, a 
willing, fun-seeking attirude is the 
only guar;ntee a parmer has - oth· 
erwise, it's up to chance. But we'll 
name off a few options that could 
lead lovers to a pleasure party, just 
for kicks. 

Hand jobs 
First, the man must be in a com· 

foruble position, mostly because it's 
difficult for his partner to figure out 
how to keep rubbing in the exact 
same motion without having his or 
her arm fal l asleep in the process. A 
constant, well -placed and perfectly 
pressured movement is what it takes 
to get a man off, but changi ng the 
movement and teasing the penis for 
a while will make the evenrual 
orgasm much more appreciated. 
Lub~cation is also your friend, be it 
saliva, KY, Vaseline or vaginal fluids . 
Here are a few suggestions to fool 
around with: 

- Alternate the pressure in your 
fingers and palm as you move up and 
down the shaft. It keeps the penis 
guessing. 

- Turn the palm around the 
penis like a screw while moving, but 
don't clinch too hard. Ask to watch 
him masrurbate a lime and take note 
of the angle, pressure and speed. 
This wi ll indicate the movement 
needed to get him off. Also, use both 
hands, one playing with the shaft, 
one teasing the tip. 

- Touch yourself while doing it. 

If it happens at UCSD it's in the GUARDIAN CAMPUS CALENDAR, page 10 

Above al l else, I am going to 
stress that it depends on the guy. 
Assuming the relationship is a steady 
union, the absolute best thing a lover 
can do is learn to pleasure by listen-
ing, experimenting, learnjng and 
most of all, asking. As awkward as 
aslr.ing and showing really seem, it 
can yield quite glorious results just to 
be nice and clear about what you, the 
man being pleasured, want. It is 
impossible for me, or anyone else, to 
give the sure-fire trick for making 

Do it standing up, lying down, 
behind him, in front of him, every

way you can. 

Blow jobs 
First, know that the testicles are a 

very important part of the blow job. 
Don't neglect them with either 
mouth or hands, and be extremely 
gentle! 

- Teeth and lips: Most guys 
don't like teeth, and when they do, 
it's usually a minor soft scraping that 
just tickles and leases a bit. Use your 
lips to cover them, or just arch them 
away from the penis. Puckering the 
lips is nice because it gives men a 
visual. And keep the lips soft with 
chapstick. Try pulling very slowly up 
on the penis, sucking and releasing 
frequently as you move up, and mov-
ing the tongue around while you're 
at it. 

- Tongue: Keep it actively 
involved while sucking! Tease and 
rub tile tip of the penis with your 
tongue, or use it to cover your teeth 
if your lips aren't flexible enough. 
Slide it all around the haft, or try 
moving your tongue in the opposite 

" Puckering the lips is 
nice because it gives 

men a visual. " 
direction your mouth is going, i.e. 
when you draw up a Ijme, push 
down. 

Try taking the whole penis into 
your mouth and just working with 
your tongue. A fun thing to do with 
the testicles is to take them both in 
your moutlt at the same time and 
draw figure eights around them with 
your tongue while softly sucking. 

- Throat: How do you get the 
penis all the way down there? The 
best way is to go from the "69" posi-
tion with the man on bottom. This 
angle aligns the mouth and opens 
the throat so that all you have to do 
is control your gag reflex while slid-
ing down the penis. 
"Deepthroating" from the front is 
hard because the runnel down the 
throat is cut off by the angle of your 
head, but that doesn't mean you 
can't try it. 

- Hands: Keep them on the 
shaft while the mouth is working on 
the head, twisting, pulling and pres-
surizing. [f the mouth has most of 
the penis occupied, run them all over 
the man's body, play with his balls, . 
rub his ass and lower back, or lightly 
stimulate the hip bones and 
abdomen area. You can also massage 
the prostate gland by either locating 
it between the testes and the anus, or 
by acrually inserting the finger into 
the anus and rubbing on the wall 
toward the penis. 

There, a list of fun things to try. 
Don't do too much at one time 
though - this may defeat your pur-
poses - but go on and experiment, 
and then let me know how it went.

falters in Triton Invitational

25 points in the game. Johnson 
completed 13 points and had 10 
rebounds, while Buffum had 10 
rebounds. Sophomore forward 
Hansen and junior guard Herold 
both posted 12 points. 

Tritons were able to cling to their 
first half success as they trailed the 
Mustangs in the second, making 
only three of their nine attempts 
while the Mustangs completed 
nine of 10. However, the Tritons 
converted strongly from three-
point range, which eventually 
made the difference in the game. 
UCSD completed seven of 12 
while the M.ustangs only convert-

offensive play throughout their 
time at UCSD. Johnson averages 
roughly 15 points and eight 
rebounds per game. She is also 11 th 
in UCSD scoring history with 838 
points, and fifth in rebounds with 
675. Johnson is well on her way to 
becoming the second UCSD player 
to break 1,000 in both points and 
rebounds. 

Gallagher-Bolton leads the 
team in two categories. She is tied 
with Johnson for rebounds, aver-
aging around eight per game, but 
also leads the team in assists, aver-
aging 3.8 per ga me, a rare 
achievement for her position as a 
center. 

Juster led the scoring for the 
Tritons with 19 points, followed by 
Johnson who had 17 points and 11 
rebounds. Gallagher-Bolton posted 
eight points and 11 boards, Siam

point range, but the Tritons' con-
tinued struggles at the charity 
stripe, shooting at just over 50 
percent, kept the teain from mak-
ing any dent in the Mavericks ' 
lead. Mesa State had three play-
ers in double-digit scoring, 
including center Andy Classick 
with a game-high 13 . Tony Qorri 
notched seven rebounds for the

UCSD 30- 19 overall. 
Sophomore guard Robby Peters 
leu UCSD in scoring with II

The UCSD men 's basketball 
t eam notched the program's 
500th victory with a 76-64 victo-
ry over the crosstown rival Point 
Lorna on Dec. 17 at RIMAC 
Arena. The teams played a game 
that alternated between scoring 
spurts and droughts. After the 
Sea Lions jumped out to a 10-0 
lead to start the contest, the 
Tritons came back to lead by 12 
points going into halftime. In the 
second half, the Tritons were 
a ble to extend their lead to as 
much as 23 points before the Sea 
Lions battled back to cut the 
deficit to seven with just over 
two minutes left. However, the 
Tritons were able to hold on, 
limiting the Sea Lions to four 
points in the final two minutes to 
get the victory. 

Although Point Lorna out-
rebounded UCSD, 34-26, and 
dominated on the offensive 
boards, 10-2 , the Tritons won 
thanks to good shooting from 
the field, shooting 56.5 percent 
for the game and 47 .1 percent 
from outside. The Tritons were 
helped by a career-high 12 
points in 18 minutes from fresh-
man guard Joey Toboni, who 

, continued /rom page 20 
heading back to the drawing 
board. 

uYou won't see this UCLA 
team again," said receiver Junior 
Taylor, who scored UCLA's first 
touchdown of the game. "You 
won't see a team lay down and 
play bad football against a 6-5 
team." 

Taylor, a junior, insisted tha t 
things will change. He said the 
team's attitude and mindset need 
to change, because he never wants 
to have this feeling again . 

"I'm not going to go out like 
this, " Taylor said. "I'm not going 
to let this university, thi s team, 
play like this ever again." 

Things looked bad fo r the 
Bruins from the outset . After a 
big return by so pho more 
Maurice Drew on the opening 
kickoff, UCLA's drive stall.ed . 
Before long, the Bruins found 
themselves in a 10-0 hole against 
Wyoming.

down several plays later on an

Sophomore Justi n Medlock 
missed a 45-yard field goal after 
senior Matt C lark made a key 
interceptio n, and then Bram let 
orchestrated the drive of the 
game. The Cowboy signal~caller, 
who fini shed 20-of-34 for 307 
yards and two touchdowns, was 
impressive on the Cowboys' final 
drive, maki ng a cri tical fourth -
down conversion as well as a huge 
thi rd -down co nversion at the start 
of the drive. 

A questionable pass interfer-
ence call on Clark put the ball at

They were able to climb out of 
the hole for a while , and it 
appeared on numerous occasions 
that the Bruins would put the 
game out of reach. Olson threw a 
touchdown w Taylor before get-
ting hurt, and backup quarterback 
David Koral , who hadn't thrown a 
pass in Division I football prior to 
Thursday, did a decent job filling 
in. Koral, who finished 7 -of-1 2

down passes to guide UCLA to a 
21-10 lead.

first seven games of the season. 
The team also gained 14 points 
and five rebounds from Berling, 
II points from sophomore for-
ward Chris Randall and to 
points from Peters, who leads 
the team with 10.t average 
points per game. The Tritons 
also committed sill fewer 
turnovers than their opposition 
while getting to the free-throw 
line nine more times and con-
verting eight more from the line. 
The 500th victory brings the 

team's all -time record to 500-

After a respectable record dur-

games, head coach Bill Carr will 
look to lead the Triwns through 
baclc-to-back away games. Action 
will resume on Jan. 7, when they 
look to improve their CCAA con-

Calif., with tip-off scheduled for 
7 :30 p.m., followed the next night 
by an 8 p.m. tip-off against Chico 
State (6-3) in Chico, Calif. 

But mistakes, foolish penalties 
and some bad luck sealed the 
Bruins' fate. 

"We had some opportuni ties to

them," Dorrell said. "This was

Tritons notch sooth vidory 
during December home stand 

By JOE TEVELOWITZ 
Staff Writer 

After playi ng .500 ball during 
its Deccmber home stand , the 

CSD men's baskctba ll team 
enters 2005 with a 4-4 overall 
record. 

T he Triton, looki ng to start 
at the top o f the pack in CCAA 
conference play, started off on a 
sour note in that aspect with a 
66-48 10 s to Cal Sta te 
Bakersfield in thei r CCAA con-
ference opener on Dec. 3 at 
RIMA Arena. The Tritons 
were behi nd by 15 points after 
the fim half due to poor shoot-
ing from the field and a lack of 
presence in rebounding. The 
Triton ' 35-percent field-goal 
percentage was dwarfed in com-
parison to the 62.5-percent first 
ha lf shooting percentage from 
the Roadrunner, who also out-
rebounded C 0 , 17-8. 

The C D team sh owed 
resolve, goi ng on a 15-5 ru n in 
the second half to cut 
Bakersfield's lead to seven. 
Ilowevcr, the Roadru nners 
proved too powerful, endi ng the 
game on a 20-9 run. Freshman 
guard Clint Allard led the T ritons 
with 15 points, five rebounds and 
three assists, wh ile the 
Roadrunners gOt 13 points from 
Yancey Stanciell and nine points 
and nine rebounds fro m Andre 
l lardwick. 

CSD fo llowed up the disap-
poi nting loss with a 59-57 home 
win over Ca l State Los Angeles 
on Dec. ~. The Triton emerged 
victorious in the nai l-biter thanks 
to clutch play from fres hman 
guard Andrew Hatch, who led the 
team with 15 points, including 
th ree in the fina l 18 seconds. 

fter the Golden Eagles built a 
double-digit lead in the second 
half, the Tri tons bounced back. 
W ith neithe r tea m shooting 
exceptionally well from the fi eld 
o r the three-point range, the 
T ritons were the beneficiaries of 
th e Golden Eagles' struggles 
from the free-throw line, con-
verting only 15 of 23 compared to 
24 of 34 fo r the Tritons. Jon

J ackson added 13 and 12 points, 
respectively. T he Tritons got 13 
po ints from sophomore guard 
Robby Peters. Sophomore for-
ward Parker Berling collected a 
game-high nine rebounds while 
also going four-of-four from the 
free-throw Line. 

After a week off during finals 
week, the UCSD men's basketball 
team returned to the court against 
Mesa State on Dec. 15 at RIMAC 
Arena. The Tritons were unable 
to keep up with a blistering shoot-
ing performance from the 
Mavericks, who built a 17 -point 
advantage at halftime on the way 
to an 81 -55 victory. The loss 

dropped the Tritons below .500 
for the year and also kept them 
one win shy of the men's basket-
ball program's SOOth victory. The 
Mavericks seemed to be firing on 
all cylinder in the first half, 
shooting 79 percent from the field 
and 88 percent from behind the 
three-point arc, while the Tritons, 
despite shooting a respectable 
44.4 percent from the field, strug-
gled behind the arc and at the 
free-throw line. 

The Mavericks' shooting 
cooled off a bit in the second half, 
sljpping to 50 percent from the

Wyoming stuns UCLA 
in Las Vegas Bowl 
By DAVID REGAN WIllIe Wyoming (7- 5), having 

not appeared in a bowl game since 
1993 and having not won a bowl 
game since 1966, scored one of its 
biggest victories in school history, 
the Bruins suffered one of their 
worst losses in recent memory.

new UCSD recruiting program

(U- WIRE) LAS VEGAS 

Welcome to Karl Dorrell's night-
mare. 

Just when it looked like the 
UCLA football program had 
finally turned the corner, it all 
came crashing down with a 
resounding thud . 

CLA end ed its season on the 
lowest of lows Dec. 23, losing 24-
2 1 to Wyoming in the Las Vegas 
Bowl. 

It was an ugly, uninspired per-
formance from the Bruins (6-6), 
who have now lost to a middle-of-
the-pack Mountain West oppo-
nent to end each of the last two 
seasons. 

"Unfortunately, we're going 
into the off-sea on with a loss, 
another loss," a forlorn Dorrell 
aid after the ga me. "It just proves 

h w much work we have left to 
do." 

A lot had to go wrong for 
UCLA to lose this football game, 
and a lot did go wrong. Starting 
quarterback Drew Olson was 
knocked out of the game in the 
second quarter with a sprained 
knee, leading junior taclder 
Spencer Havner didn't play and 
sure-handed senior Craig Bragg 
fumbled a punt that gave the ball 
back to the Cowboys late in the 
game. 

By the time Wyoming quarter-
back Corey Bramlet threw a 12-

In an effort to boost fan 
support for UCSD sports, 
specifically the basketball pro-
gram, UCSD Intercollegiate 
Ath letics is creating a spin-off 
of NBC's "The Apprentice" 
and ESPN's "Dream Job" by 
holding its own UCSD Sports 
Dream Job and UCSD Sports 
Apprentice contests beginning 
on Jan. 6 and Jan. 14, respec-
tively. 

UCSD Sports Dream Job 
allows two finalists an opportu-
nity to put their color-com-
mentating skills and sportS 
ltnowledge to the test during a 
live broadcast on Jan. 14, when 
the men's and women's basket-
ball teams host Cal State 
Monterey Bay at RIMAC 
Arena. The application process 
include a pap ' r application, 

in-persoll interview, sports 
trivia quiz and on-camera audi-
tions. ICA will select four 
applicants to announce the 
halftime promotions on Jan. 12 
when both UCSD basketball 
teams play Cal State San 
Bernadino. It wi ll then choose 
two of the four for the Jan. 14 
live broadcasts. The deadline to 
apply is Jan. 6. 

ICA is launching UCSD 
Sports Apprentice for the first 
time, with a goal of publicizing a 
men's basketball program that 
has undergone many changes 
since last season, with the hiring 
of head coach Bill Carr. Carr and 
his staff have recruited new play-
ers for the program and are aim-
ing to put UCSD men's basket-
ball on the map. 

The contest asks those inter-
ested in marketing to creatively 
market and promote four 
UCSD men's basketball home 

games. UCSD Sports 
Apprentice consists of four 
teams of up to four members 
each, includjng a team leader. 
Each team must create an inno-
vative business plan to promote 
a basketball game and the team 
leader must present his or her 
team's marketing strategy 
before a panel of local market-
ing and business professionals. 

The four teams will be 
judged on the presentation of 
their plans and the attendance 
for the games they promoted. 
The winning team receives a 
prize and the leader of that 
team will be named the 2005 
UCSD Sports Apprentice and 
will also receive a grand prize. 
The deadline to apply for this 
contest is Jan. 14. Both contests 
are open to all UCSD under-
graduate students. For more
