Council supports 
housing for transfers 
Resolution backs on .. campus 

dwellings for transfer students 
By NEIL SPEARS 
Senior Staff Writer 

The A. . Council passed a 
resolution in support of on-cam-
pus housi ng for transfer stu-
dents at its May 28 meeting. 
The resolution call upon the 
university "to expedite the con-
struction of transfer housing 
projects" and affirms the coun-
ci l's "support of granting trans-
fer swdents a guaranteed hous-
ing agreement a oon as po 1-
ble." 

T he resolution pas ed 16-3-0. 
Viet Tran, chair of the 

Tran fer Re-entry Student 
Organization at T hurgood 
Mar hall College, authored the 
resolution III response to the 
delay of the construction of the 
North Campus Iiou ing project. 

The pi oject was slated to 
begin in Winter 2004, but build-
ing will not begin until Slimmer 
2004. With the quarter-long 
delay, e timatcd completion of 
the project was pushed back. 
from 2005 to 2007, according to 
Tran. 

"I'lwo years] is lik.e a genera-
tion of transfer srudents," Tran 
said. 

Debate on the council noor 
focused mainly on the wording of 
the resolution. 

At one pomt, ommis ioner 
of Entcrprbe Operauons Jeremy 

Cogan pointed out that by 
endorsing the fast construction of 
transfer hou ing, the council may 
be running contrary to its recent 
efforts to slow the loss of under-
graduate parlc.ing spaces to con-
struction. 

Marshall enior Senator 
ierra Catcott argued that since 

the resolution does not specifical-
ly mention the orth Campu 
Housing project, the spirit of the 
resolution docs not violate previ-
ous A.S. resolutions. 

"I don 't want to make it look 
lik.e it's either transfer housi ng or 
parlc.ing," Tran aid. "My stance 
I that if they're going to push 
building back half a year. The 
resolution i to expedite that 
project 0 it can be finished on 
time or, at the very least, one 
year late." 

Tran also pointed out that 
transfer tudents make up an 
increasing fraction of the under-
graduate population. Tran fer 
students repre enred 26 percent 
of the 2002 incoming cIa . 

"That's a big population that 
i underrepresented and doe not 
have a voice on thi campus," 
Tran said. "We're trying to 
increase that voice so more peo-
ple can pay m re attention to our 
cause,"

Berkeley satellite finds 
secret to explosions 

Piaures taken by the UC Berkeley's 
NASA-launched Reuven Ramaty High Energy 
Solar SpectroscopIc Imager satenite have 
made the novel observation that gamma ray 
polarization arises from an area of highly 
structured magnetic fields that were found to 
be stronger than any others that have been 
observed in the universe. 

Gamma ray bursts are flashes of gamma 
ray photons that blast off daily into the sky 
and are approximately as bnght as a million. 
trillion suns. The recent observations provide 
SCientists a new perspective in the driVIng 
force of the gamma ray bursts. 

The polanzatlon was also found to have 
underlymg physical symmetry and. therefore. 
reflect extreme~ aligned magnetic fields. 
Previous observations have also showed that 
a supemova is the foundation of gamma-ray 
bursts. 

Vv'hile the discovery of polarization reveals 
that gamma ray bursts are powered through 
the formation of powerful. large-scale mag-
netic fields. theorists must still provide 
answers to why some supemovae result in 
organized magnetic fields. 

Protein could help 
diabetics and burn victims 

UCSD biologists have recent~ discovered 
that a protein fundamental to the embryonic 
development of fruit flies IS also utilized by 
mammals in healing cuts and lacerations. 

The 'c-Jun" protein. also called the 'tran-
scripbon factor" because I tums genes on and 
off. bnngs cells together dunng he embryoniC 
developmen of Drosophila fruit flies. The 
embryoniC development process of sheets of 
cells fUSing 0 he dorsal midline was observed 
o be SImilar to e way sheets of mammalian 

skin ceils come together to heal wounds. 
According 0 the head 0 the research eam 

and aSSOCIate professor Randall S. Johnson. 
even though the fUSion of cells In making flies 
and healing skin are very dlfferen~ hiS team's 
research has shown that WlthoU the protein. 
cells In mouse skin duster at the edge of a 
wound. Johnson said that destgnlng drugs that 
would promote the chemical pathway would 
also Improve the abllrty of diabencs to heal 
from cuts and wounds. 

Discovenng ways to Improve wound heal-
Ing would also be benefioal to bum VICtims and 
others who have slow healing of s n lesions.

$6.250 for fall quarter programs, 
the second-highest amount of 
funding for any student group. 

" \ Ve 're really excited With 
I OFAB's l decision and we're 
looking forward to fall quarter," 
sa id Ian Almaz..1n. IIlcoming AP A

The organizauon plans to use 
the majority of its funds to run a

about the funding. 

"I was in the room With the

Three appeals were filed for 
changes to the initial allocations. 

An appeal heard for Campus

organization $781 in funding. 

Appeals filed by the Cognitive

not result in funding changes for

loved the opportulllty to Itve on-

" \\ 'hat IS it about transfer stu-

to live off-campus than other Stu-
dents?" Rosenfeld said. 

The resolution states that 
"many transfer students are at a 
disadvantage when seeking hous-
Ing because of their lack of ability 
to view their houslIlg opnon prior 
to Signing a contract." 

Other i terns of concern Itsted in 

the resolution include the compet-

housing market in La Jolla, the 
opinion that on-campus housing 
"e.1SCS the acclimation of transfer

similar to what

they had limited 
seating; and three, 
they filled over

"G 0 n-eiri an bothar 

leat .... " 'May the road 
ri e up to meet you,' 

begins a famous Irish blessing. It 
ha taken a year's worth of study-
ing through two courses of 
Modern frish Gaelic to be able to 
translate this simple wish. Now, 
with this blessing being directed 
at me by J mh friends, it is a 
c1aunting reality check. My Irish 
education is finished and my trf'k 
from Corcaigh back to an Diego 
is merely weeks away. 

I knew it would seem like a 
short year. However, bracing for 
the end months beforehand does-
n't quite prepare you. As friends 
leave, my mood becomes nostalgic 
and reflective. I suppose then it 's 
natural to try and categorize the 
lessons, skills and memories 
obtained from a emotionally rig-
orous, but unparalleled year. 

Looking back, I have had the 
extraordinary fortune to be in 
Ireland this year. As far as impart-
ing my political beliefs as [ have 
often anempted in this column, it 
could not have been a bener year. 
Before I left for my host counery, I 
was told not to worry tOO much 
about how I would be treated. As 
examples, I was g.ven te ol11onl3l

FAQ on REEF Financing 
Question: How are Education Investments different 'ram a loan? 

Answer: Loans are sums of money lent at interest. Education Investments 
are sums of money disbursed to students at no interest. The 
obligation of an Education Investment is based on a fIXed percentage 
of future income for a fIXed period of time. This program allows 
flexibility in obligation according to your economic situation. 
Which means, you pay less when you have less and more when you 
have more. 

Question: Can these Educatloa Investments pay far all of my tuition? 
Answer: Education Investments are a great complement for students that 

have already received grants, scholarships and federal loans, but 
still need more money for their living costs. REEF can help students 
fill the gap between what you have and what you need. REEF will 
fund a maximum of $7000 for cost of living expenses per school 
year. 

Question: How does this affect my Financial Aid packag.? 
Answer: Education Investments will not affect your Financial Aid package. 

REEF works closely with the Financial Aid Office and the Student 
Business Office at UCSD to ensure Education Investment 
disbursements fit into your cost of living package. As opposed to 
increasing the amount of loans you are responsible for, you now 
have an alternative way to finance your education that's more 
sensitive to your future ability to pay. 

Question: How are these Plrclntagl rates d.termln.d? Will th.y changl 
throughout till IIfl of thl obligation? 

Answer: Percentage rates begin: 
0.1-!. for graduate students (1/10 of one percent) 
0.2-/_ for undergraduate students (1/5 of one percent) 

Rates are specific to each applicant. Education Investments are 
awarded on a case-by-case basis. The more information a student 
gives REEF, the more accurately a rate is determined. Students are 
encouraged to inform REEF about their goals, career plans, internships, 
major, test scores, CPA and anything else they think is relevant 
regarding their future.

wonderful to be embraced by the 
international community, who all 
felt "American" during our darkest 
hour. However, this year, we werc 
giyen the opportunity to witness 
the broad divirsity of beliefs and 
world views brought about by 
intense debate and controversy. 

I saw the truth of what others 
think of America. While everyone 
understands that we are hated 
somewhere in the world, it is much 
different to be faced with it person-
ally. KnOWIn~ your accent will 
affect how someone treats you 
gives me a better scnse of the anger 
that the world ha felt this year. J 
have a much bener appreciaoon of 
those who still love America and 
show their upport when it IS the 
unpopular thing to do. 

Consequently, I have had a 
poignant glimpse 'into the defini-
tion and ralllJfications of patrio-
ti m. My political ideology has not 
changed a great deal. I am sti ll 
incensed by staunch socialists, who 
have gained control and then 
dcstroyed the Irish health care 5y5-
tem, but I am also angry to hear 
about compatriots at home who 
think that dissent against the gov-
ernment is unpatriotic. [ still 
believe that collegiate leftist pro-
testers are myopic, hypocritical and 
are biting the hand that feeds them, 
but J refuse to take part in the anti-
French sentiment that is supposed-
ly veeping U.S. conservatives. 

I love America now more than I 
ever have, but I have learned to 
question It while appreclJong that 
abi lity to quesoon - wruch IS whJt 
we call freedom. nderstandmg 
the European pcn,pecove has led to

under tanding my friends' and ene-
mies' viewpoints at the same time 
with the same validity. 

My realizations were not all 
political. There arc some social 
illusions whose disappearance is 
bittersweet. My infaruation with 
the Irish accent has disa ppatcd, 
which is both sad (J n o longer 
swoon over Irish girls whde they 
speak) and encouraging (I no 
longer stcrcotype pcoplc by thc 
pitch and tone of thclr vOice). I 
have listencd to so much Iri sh tra-
ditional musIc that It has lost its 
fairy talc magic, but III Its placc, I 
have a respect for Its history and 
an appreciation for a ycar's worth 
of proximity to its mUSICians. 

Some losscs arc not so easi ly 
assuaged. I am leaving a place 
where the pubs are fnendly, the 
music is fantastic and the beer is 
spectacular. I will have to senle for 
canned Guinness, which no self-
respecting Iri shman would drink. 
I will lose friends and my ability to 
have interactions every day that 
broaden my culrural views and 
offer my mind ideas of travel, 
research and future occupations. I 
am leaving a culture, which I alll 
now accustomed to and will ha\'e 
to re-adapt to American life. 

Many skills are lost in the lran-
si tion. Irish Gaelic will be u elcss 
in California. The ability to tell a 
good pub from a bad pub Will be 
irrelevant as the only Irish puhs in

THE U D GUARDIAN M NDAY. JUNE 2, 2003 

Reflecting on freshman year 
UCSD experience a good one, despite flaws 
By MARIANNE MADDEN 

Staff Writer 

Lct's take a look at this year's 
freshman clas. \ \ 'e were over-
achievers in high school, we had 
CdSY classes and we wcnt home to 
our parents evcry wcekend. Those 
who were popular in high school 
hung on to clique-Ish tendencies 
and Abercrombie clothes, and 
those who were dorky in high 
school became Geisel -haunting 
bookworms who get busted for 
exces ivc Internet file ~haring. 

That's the general picture. 
I Iere's a specific one. 

nentation was, by far, the most 
hellish time I've had to endure in 
college thus fa r and it had the cruel 
irony of being utterly di orientating 
(not to mention demoralizing). 
Trekking around campus for days at 
the mercy of an ebullient orienta-
tion leader, and being bombarded 
with fl yers, information and obvi-
ously, fiction al stories about the 
Stuart Art Collection gave me an 
overwhelming desire to curl into a 
ball, retreat back home and never 
mingle with any of my peer in 
forced "meet-and-greet" activities 
ever again. Orientation did have 
one undeniably po itive aspect, 
though - it made Welcome Week 
and each week si nce in credibl e 
cakewalks in comparison. 

Welcome Week was positively 
surreal. Like rypical freshmen, my 
apartment-males and I were sti ll 
entertaining the notion that we 
could be best friends and skipped ofT 
together to every campus event we 
could find. Those campus events 
were pretty fun, I'll admit, but get-
ting dressed up for a pajama party 
and learrung on the walk there that it 
had already been busted by the cops, 
while qwntessentiaJly collegl3te, was 
nonetheless a bit dlsheartenmg. 

After Welcome Week ended, the 
reality set in - I was living on my 
own, joining activioes, shurtling to 
RIMAC every weekday to dance two 
hours a night, making friends and 
taking classes, all without any slgruf-
Icant problems. It almost felt like a 
COp-Out to have that rocl,), period of 
adjustment full of learful phone 
calls, wrenchlllg ~oul- carchlllg, 
clashes In pnontif'l and problclm 
with acaderruc, never lIlatcna"zc.

COMMENTARY 

" The biggest threat to full 
nights of sleep was my 

apartmenHMtes) early~ 
morning, blaring, bass~ 

heavy hip~hop . " 
And as fo r the revered UCSD 

tradition, the all -nighter? T he 
biggest threat to full nights of sleep 
was my apartment-mates' early-
mornjng, blaring, bass-heavy hip-
hop. At a school where the dark 
under-eye circles and re idual caf-
feine-induced jitters of all -nighters 
are strange status symbols, I stick 
out like a sore thumb. 

College is often billed as a radical 
departure from everything about 
high school, and UCSD definitely 
eschewed some of the more terrible 
aspects of the previous four years. 
BUl UCSD seems like simply an 
overgrown high school at times, and 
the student body soli manag to 
constantly whine about classes and 
resent the adlmni tration, campus 
new paper and student government, 
despite having gone through great 
pain and expense to come here. 

Apparently, dwell ing on every 
remotely negative aspect of UCSD 
seems to be a popular area of mde-
pendent nldy among UCSD stu-
dcnts. At first, I was surprised and 
dIsmayed by thiS ob,~ous mirror of 
our hjgh school careers, but I've 
come to accepl the unj\'ersal truth 
tllal no matter how accommodJtlng 
our roommates, how lIluch fun we 
had over tile \\ eckend, how awc-
some our classes arc, how lIluch Ill'

i7,ed the college application period 
would subside after scruor year, yet 
I'm acutely aware of my acquain-
tances who, say, chose UCSD over 
I3erkeley or were dissuaded to 
attend Davis at the very last mlllute. 

Furthermore, we constantly 
decry our lack ofSDSU's crazy par-
ties, the prc~tigc of Berkeley and 
the hot-guy IIll'3 tmarket of UCLA. 
SDSU mjght havc hetter parrics 
and ,UCLA might have hottcr guys, 
bur only UCSD has a c IIlfonable 
proximity to both (and Berkeley, of 
cour e, is overra ted and filthy) . I, 
for one, have to wonder how those 
UCLA guys can be fully enjoyed in 
the three square feet of living !opace 
UCLA tudents are afforded. 

And let's not forge t UCS D's 
most lovable tra it: the college sys-
tem and its mysterious sister, the 
inte r-college tran fer. U D likes 
to pretend inter-college transfers 
don't exist and fo r good reason: 
T he university pu ts a lot of work 
into maintai ning the image that all 
six colleges are incredibly wonder-
ful and are Oexible enough to per-
fectly accommodate any student. 

Some of us, like myself, don't buy 
a bit of it and are fi lled wi dl a sense 
of misplacement - GE angst, if you 
will - from the beginn ing. For 
spring quarrer, freshmen who get a 
perverse thrill from writing personal 
tatements, filling out forms, formu-

lating four-year plan , pissing off the 
acadenuc advisors and waiti ng fo r 
morc than a month to be notified of 
the decision, imer-college transfers 
are positively thri ll ing. My request 
was accepted, and ncxt year, I will 
enjoy fewer GEs and, beca use of the 
timing of room selection, live in the 
college I defected from. It should be 
interesting, to say the least. 

And to mix up my hving situa-
tion even furtller, I also moved 
across campus after fa ll quarter -
an option that too few people know 
exists (or perhaps they ecretly lovc 
complaining about a teeny room, 
difficult roommates and the like?). 
\-\li th the help of the central hous-
ing office, two friend~ and a J landa, 
I was in my new place 1t!S!I than twO 
weeks after I decided to move. 1y 
new place afforded me a hugc bed-

UC uses vigilance against terror 
UC police become part of national effort 

Bake sale: Students show to 
protest College Republicans 

continued from page I and it get~ people thinking. Maybe 
someone who had never thought of 
affirmative aCtion before will real-
ize that not haVing ,Iffirmatl ve 
action causes less <hversity." 

By PAUL THORNTON 
Daily Californian (UC Berkeley) 
(U-WIR E) BERKELEY, 

Calif. In J timc of heightened 
security and fear of a possiblc 
terrorist a ttack close to home, 
vigilance is the mc sage 
UllIvcrsity of California police 
offer student~, faculty and staff 
on campus. 

UC police have become pan of 
a larger national effon to increase 
everyday security as terrorist 
attack threats have reached 
"or,lnge" - or high rISk - levels 

~ince the beginning of the year. 
But doing so at a college cam-

pus like UC Berkeley presents 
polrcc widl a ta k more unique 
than the rest of the nation's. 

"\ Ve're alway a very open 
envlronmcnt," said C pollee 
Capt. Bill Cooper. "We don'l have 
a big wa ll around campus or any-
thing like that. A lot of It re lics on 
extra vigilance." 

Bemg on the lookout for secu-
rity's sake, however, involves more 
than just the UC police keeping a 
more watchful eye. Most of UC 
po"ce's efforts have bcen directed 
at making students themselves 
more watchful for their own safe-
ty. 

"Pan of what we also do is try 
to get the communjty to be alert," 

ooper said. 
Among those efforts is a \Veb 

page pllt together by UC police, 
~peCifically dedicated to the mo t 
recent "Orange" alen on i\ lay 
20. 

Bllt whether UC police's 
efforts h.ll'e been effectlvc IS ques-
tionable to some. 

Join the 

"I glless the only thing I see is 
more police on campus, but I 
don't see any difference in their 
activities," said U Berkeley 
junior Maya Pandurangi. "The 
only thing I really see them do i 
pull over my friends to issue them 
bike tickets." 

Some other, however, feel 
that the police's efforts gOing 
unnoticed signals a more safc 
campus, 

"[ haven't really noticed any-
thing, and I guess that's a good 
thing," said UC Berkeley sCnlor 

" All of a sudden, people 
said 'Whao ) if a bomb 
explosion can happen at 
Yale , it can happen at 

Berkeley. »)) 
- BiD Cooper, 

UC police captain 

I Iarri on KIat. "That means 
thi n,?,s are pretty afe and low 
key. 

Whether UC Berkeley is even 
a target that warrants additional 
precautions is a matter of debate. 

A recent bomb bla t at Yale 
Law School, however, pre ented 
the dangerous reality that college 
campuses are not immune to 
attacks. The FBI still has not 
deemed the attack one of terror-
Ism. 

"All of a sudden, people sa id 
' \Nh03 , If a bomb explOSIOn ca n 

happen at Yale, it can happen at 
Berkeley,'" Cooper said. 

Whi le most of C police's 
efforts have been directed at 
IIlcreasing vigilance on campus, 
officers have undergone practica l 
training thought unneces. ary 
before Sept. II . 

Among UC police'., trainmg IS 
how to handle a chemical or hio-
logical weapons attack. for more 
than i1 year, UC police have been 
armed with Sproul - a dog 
trained to sniff out hombs and 
other weapons. 

Further training events IIlclud-
ed an exercise last June that 
IIlvolved both the City and the uni-
versity. The exercise si mulated a 
disaster that would have involved a 
crop-du ting airplane stri klllg a 
ciry building. 

But the university's proximity 
to several active fau lt lines ha 
been a plus for disaster response 
personnel, said Tom Klatt, UC 
police director of emergency plan-
ning and communication. 

Because UC police officers 
have had exten ive traming In 
re ponding to a major earth-
quake - which presents chal-
lenge nearly identical to a ter-
rorist attack - disaster response 
personnel are well-equipped to 
handle a terrorist strike, Klatt 
said. 

Despite the "Orange" threats, 
C police still recognizes its 

efforts should not go too far as to 
IIlhiblt the normal day-to-day 
opera nons of the university, Klatt 
sa id . 

"\ \'e are still an open culture 
and an open c1imatc of Jcadcl1l1a," 
Klan said. 

lot of people don't agree with us, 
that's not the point." 

The group put together certlfi-
ca tcs that would have been 
redeemable for baked goods accord-
mg to a speCific value. The different 
prices were set according to minori-
ty groups . .\Imomy females were 
priced at 25 cents, minority males at 
SO cent~, white females at one dollar 
and white males at two dollars.

prevented the group from actually

Advoca tes for 
affirmative action responded to the 
group's table. While some engaged 
in debates on Library Walk, others 
held up sign in protest against the 
anti-affirmative action views. 
Protester Luis Lopez held a sign 
saying "Diversity Sucks, Ban

According to Lopez, he Intended

New grade policy approved 
Revision addresses cases of academic dishonesty 

By LlSAMAK 
Staff Writer 

A revision to the UCSD Policy 
on Integrity of Scholar hip was 
approved by a unanimous vote at 
the May 27 Academic enate 
meeting. The revi ion , jointly 
submi tted to the Senate by the 
Committec on Educational Policy 
and the Council of Provosts, con-
sistS of (he establishment of new 
administrativc authority and new 
policies for grades in cases of aca-
demic d ishonesty. 

In the current sys tem, the 
admini trative authority for cases 
of undergraduate academic dis-
honesty is the dean of the student's 
college, with appeals going to the 
provost of the college. The 
admini trative authority for ca es 
involving graduate students is the 
assistant dean of graduate studies, 
with appeals going to the dean of 
graduate studies. 

Once an insrructor has suspi-
cions of academic dishonesty, they 
may contact the student conduct 
coordinator, the assistant dean of 
graduate studies, the college dean 
or the assistant to the vice chancel-
lor for academic a ffairs for advice 
on what procedures to take, 

The revised policy transfers 
the admi nistrative authority for 
undergraduate cases from the 
dean of the student's college to the 
council of deans of student affairs. 
Although students still meet for a 
one-on-Oll!; interview wi th thei r 
college dean, recommendations 
for what procedures to take in 
each case of academic dishonesty 
will be discussed and decided by 

the entire counci l. Similarly, the 
new policy transfers the appea ls 
au thority to the counci l of 
provosts. 

"1 wouldn't say our current sys-
tem is unfair, but if you have six 
sepa rate deans and provosts mak-
ing dccisions 011 their own, there' 
a greater chance that thcir under-
standing might be different," said 
Stephen Cox, chairman of CEP 
and a literature pro fessor. 

Furthermore, under the new 
policy, an instructor wishing to 
report suspected violatio ns can 
only contact the student conduct 
coordinator at Student Po licies 
and Judicial Affairs. The student 
conduct coordinator will act as a 
communication base, informing a 
student's appropriate dean of the 
charges and keeping records on 
each case. T he dean will then 
notify the studen t and must 
infonn the student on where to 
obtain advice and legal assistance. 

The student conduct coordina-
tor will also make annual repor ts 
to the CEP, the council of 
provosts and the Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs. 

According to A.S. 
Commissioner of Academic Affairs 
Todd Tolin, the new system was 
designed "to better clarify on what 
to do and how to proceed in cases 
of academic dishonesty." 

The administrative authority 
for cases with graduate srudents 
and the general structure of the 
hearing board remain unchanged. 

Another secoon of the revised 
policy states that a student with a 
pending case of academic dishon-
esty will be assigned an incorn-

plete mark for the course until the 
cha rge is resolved . If the student 
accepts the charges or is found 
guilty by the hearing board, the 
grade assigned by the instructor 
will be permanently entered on 
the student's transcript. The grade 
will be factored into the student's 
CPA, even if the course is retaken. 
Academic records will note that 
the grade wa assigned due to aca-
demic dishonesty. 

The revision a lso includes 
more specific wording on how 
instructors should inform students 
of course expectations and clearer 
time requirements for notifica-
tions and hearings. 

The CEP presented irs first pro-
po cd revision to the Policy on 
Integrity of Scholarship last fall, 
which was rcjected. Under this pro-
posal, the administrative authority 
would have been given to the 
Student Conduct Coordinator, 
with appeals going to Warson. 
According to Cox, the provosts and 
some students objected to the 
degree of centralization and other 
minor technical features within the 
proposal . 

"The prior proposal was more 
dangerous because it placed a lot 
of power in just a few people's 
hands," Tolin said. 

The proposal was re ferred back 
to the committee and the CEP 
then suggested that the Council of 
Provosts submi t their own revi-
sion of the policy. These revisions 
were then used as a base for the 
current proposal. 

The approved policy for acade-
mic dishonesty will become effec-
tive starting Fall Quarter 2003.

As another year draws to a close, many students look forward to 
spending the summer or following 
year studying abroad. This year, these 
students have faced numerous obsta-
cles. From fears of an anti-American 
backJash to concern over the spread of 
severe acute respiratory syndrome, 
Americans have been hesitant to trav-
el. These concerns have had some-
what of an effect on students who had 
been hoping to study abroad, while 
other students seem to have no con-
cerns at all. 

Some countries are off-limits for 
studying abroad. Students wishing to 
study in Israel, a popular study abroad 
destination, have had to set their sights 
on other countries. The UC-sponsored 
Education Abroad Program for lsrael 
has been on h91d since September 
2002 . 

"It will be reopened when it is 
deemed safe to go," said Kim Burton, 
director of the Programs Abroad 
Office. 

Those who wish to find non-UC 
sponsored programs, such as the 
Opportunities Abroad Programs, in 
countries for which EAP has suspended 
its programs will find that there is till 
no way they can tudy there. 

"As long as EAP is suspending pro-
grams for that country, it will not sup-
port rud ents in OAP programs," 
Burton said. 

T he ARS outbreak in Asia has had 
a major impact on study abroad pro-
gra ll1~ in China. While the year-long 
programs remain open, the r ntensive 
Chmese ummer Program in Beij ing 

hJ~ been ca ncelled. tudent!> who had

were aho a\ked to return to the United 
State~ .

reduced due 

thought that 
EAP had made 

the right deci -
sion, even though she was not 

cornfomble leaving China so sud-
denly," said Tonia Luo, the China advi-
sor at the Programs Abroad Office . 

These students are now "busy get-
ting readjusted" to life in the United 
States. 

"(program advisers] made every 
effort to get them back, from getting 
them plane tickets, free health insur-
ance, to helping them get academic 
credit," she said. 

The status of next year's year pro-
grams could also change. 

"We are watching the Center for 
Disease Control travel 

" 

are wearing masks and don't want to 
talk with each other. And the treat-
ment for SARS is a lot worse there 
than in the U.S." 

Although Wong has waited for his 
chance to study abroad for a long 
time, he is not too disappointed about 
missing out on the opportunity. 

"There are future opportunities 
when I can go to China even if I don't 
have the opportunity to study abroad. 
As a U.S. citizen, 1 have a lot of 
options," he said. 

While some students are postpon-
ing their trips until the following year, 
other students have had to change 
their plans, instead studying in coun-
tries such as the United Kingdom, the 

Netherlands and 
Singapore. Another advisori es for China, 

Taiwan and Hong 
Kong," Luo said. "We 
had a record number of 
applicants for China 
this year and EAP 
made an extra effon to 
get them to go." 

There are future 
opportunities when I 

can go to China 
even if I don't have 
the opportunity to 
study abroad," 

option for students to 
consider is the 
Pri nceton-i n -Bei ji ng 
program, a Chinese 
language program run 
by Princeton 
University in Beijing. 
This year it has been 
moved to the 
Princeton campus and 
has invi ted some UC 
students to participate.

decided to cancel the

"It has a great program that fits my 

histOry and philosophy double major," 
he said. "It was either that or going to 
Princeton for Princeton-in-Beijing, 
which sounded really lame." 

Despite fears of anti-American sen-
timent overseas, students who are cur-
rently abroad have not faced any dan-
gerous situations. 

"Before the war broke out, students 
reported that the U.S. media was 
overblowing everything," Burton said. 
"There were rallies that were anti-U.S., 
anti-Bush and anti-war, but not anti-
individuals. T he students fel t very 
comfortable where they were. T hey 
also said it was interesting to see the 
different media perspectives." 

Even after the war had started, Stu-
dents still did not feel any danger. 

"I felt very lucky to be in Ghana 
when President Bu h declared a tate of 
war," said Ashley O'Neil, a Eleanor 
Roosevelt College junior who recently 
returned after completing a year at the 
Un iversity of Ghana . "Many of us 
talked about it, and we all felt pretty 
much the ame way - much safer here 
than we would ever feel in America." 

She did not feel that it was nece sary 
to return home despite reque ts that 
she do so. 

"Although I got plenty of e-mails 
uggesting for me to return home for 

safl!ry reasons, I didn't - and have yct 
to - feel any anti-American sentI-
ments," she said.

How to 
deal with 
cheating 
partners 
Miranda 
Writes 

Miranda 
Dear Miranda, 

Okay, so I caught my girl in 
bed with my best friend. How do 
I get her back? 

- Chris, 21 

Dear Chris, 
I most sincerely hope that by 

"get her back" you mean "actually 
finding a way to hurt and humiliate 
her" as opposed to find a way to 
make her l:Ome baclc to you. The 
main reason I hope this is because 
she has hun and humiliated you. As 
such, she should come crawling baclc 
on her hands and knees, begging 
forgiveness, not the other way 
around. Do not, under any circum-
stances, attempt to woo her with 
gifts, begging or blasting cheesy love 
songs outside her window like John 
Cusaclc in "Say Anything." 

What you should do is show her 
that you don 't care: you don't want 
her back; you aren't hurt; and now 
you're sleeping with someone way 
hotter than he is, anyway. This is 
probably not rrue, but she needs to 
believe it is. If she sees that you're 
not a complete and total loser over 
her, she'll be thrown off balance and 
ask, "Why doesn't he care? Why, 
why, why?" 

For some reason, girls love guys 
who are jerks. So flaunt your incred-
ible jerkiness in front of her at every 
tum. Malee sure she sees you making 
out WIth at least twO different (:md 
very hot) girls. Act indifferent. This 
is the most likely way to malee her 
grovel at your feet for a second 
chance. 

And really, even if It doesn't have 
that effect, doesn't It sound like fun? 

Vengefully, 
,\1Jranda 

P.S. As for your former best friend, if 
you're feelmg parucularly vindictive, 
it would be evil of you to let a few 
people know his most embarrassing 
secre . Of course, by CVlI, I mean 
"nght." 

Dear Miranda, 
I'm dating this reaUy great 

guy who hJppens to be married. 
He swears that he doe n't love 
his wife, he loves me and his 
wife doesn 't understand him. He 
swears thu I'm the only one for 
him. All of the sudden, I have 
chlamydia and gonorrhea. Is he 
cheating on me? 

- No Name Please, 19 

Dear 0 arne, 
Sweetie, darling, honey, of rour.rt 
he~ cheatmg on you with hIS frealtmg 
wtft. And maybe some other girl, 
too, who knows) But then again, 
you're not really in a position to 
cornpl3Jn. If I were you, l'd leave 
"your" man to his wife and other 
assorted side dishes and find out 
what course of treaonent you need

From lazy freshman to involved senior ' 
Inspirat ion motivates new editor in chief 

"And rom if he's a lazy 7mln, and 
the Dude WIlS mosr unainly that: 
Quite possibly the lazim in all of us 
Angeles COUllty, which would place 
him high ill the run1ling for laziest 
1/JorlJwide. " 

- Sam Elliot as the Stranger, 
"The Big Lebowslci" 

If you break down the word 
"freshman" into its very compo-
nents, you'd be able to summarize 
my feelings a to what a high 
school graduate experiences when 
initially stepping on to a college 
campus for the first time. 

"Fresh," as in the wide-eyed 
first year is "fresh meat" for the 
intimidating world of all-night 
studying, cooler-than-thou frat 
bros and looming career prospects 
to pounce all over. I was fresh off 
the farm where 1 lived off the fat of 
the land of my parents' generosity 
and my cushy paycheck, an equa-
tion that practically spelled out 
how I was going to spend my col-
lege career. 

Sure, the Dude was lazy, but in 
the context of a campus ridden 
with O-chem and straight-A stu-
dents, I am pretty certain that I 
was one of the la7.iest people on 
the face of the earth during my 
freshman year. I wholeheartedly 
embraced the idea of an unsuper-
vised life where I could play wiffle 
ball instead of going to class or 
partalee in Century Club activities 
in my living room without the 
threat of any real consequences if I 
were to be caught - all while 
"preparing" for the real world by 
being enrolled at this acclaimed 
university. 

Too me, I was the la7.iest guy at

UCSD. Even 
nihilism was too 
exhausting for 
me, and chang-
ing these ways 
was not a priori-
ty. 

It seems as if 
there should 
appear some-
where in this 
soapbox that 
there was some 
sort of distinct 
moment where a 
light bulb was 
switched on in 
my head, as I 
reconciled my 
la7.iness only to 
immediately 
dawn on me that 
I should become 
the editor in 
chief of the most 
regularly pro-
duced student 
newspaper on 
campus. Well, I 
wouldn't neces-
sarily define it as 
a moment, but 
perhaps as a 
process that 
started immedi-
ately after the 
9/ II attacks. I 
made a point of 

" I wholeheartedly 
embraced the idea of 
an unsupervised Ufe 
where I could play 

wiff/e ball instead of

consequences if I 
were to be caught. " 

shot of history. You 
could go into the 
microfiche library at 
Geisel and pick up 
the reel containing 
theJune 6, 1934 issue 
of the Nt1JI York TImes 
and more or less 
learn about the 
important issues, cul-
ture and political sen-
timents affecting 
people on that par-
ticular day. To me, 
history is made 
every single day. Its 
coverage in the 
media validates its 
importance to the 
average person . 
Hell, even the Dude 
learns about the 
world around him 
every now and then 
by what he reads in 
the paper or watches 
on the news. 

So, I tried my 
hand as a news 
writer at The 
GUllrdia1l . My 
curiosity as to how 
issues and events at 
UCSD were cov-
ered was piqued, 
and I could spare a 
few hours from my 

editor. I ttied hard ro produce a 
news section that was representa-
tive of what was newsworthy to the 
UCSD community, and I like to 
think that I succeeded. 

In the coming year, I will be 
charged with not only providing a 
snapshot to the readers of what is 
happening on the news front of 
the UCSD campus, but to ensure 
that each section is doing its be,r 
to cover, issue by issue, the con-
temporary discussion of politics, 
college-student life and culture 
and, of course, the events and 
issues that shape the campus. 

I've learned from only the best: 
Josh, Lauren, Charlie, Carrie, Jeff, 
Alison. Geoff and Vince - I have 
learned so much from all of you 
about the ins and outs of the jour-
nalism world. Thanlc you for the 
guidance and education you have 
bestowed upon me. I am confident 
that I am more than capable to 
carry the torch and produce a pub-
lication with the quality that you 
have put so many hours into your-
selves. 

To the new staff: next year is 
going to be awesome. I hope you 
make the most out of the coming 
year. I know I will.

American and world politics fol-

real source I could find to answer a

Fusing talent, technology 
Students unite to voice thoughts 

through online literary journal arena 
By VINCENT HSIA 

Staff Writer 

UC D tudenL' express them-
selves online lhrough per~onal 
\\feb sites, Web logs, online publi -
cations or message forums, and usc 
the Wcb lO self-publish their writ-
ing, display their drtwork, or slln-
ply a, a place to vent. 

Som!! tJCS D srudents arc a part 
of an mtercolleglate online journal 
callcd Pomdfxter. POllldf,l:ler is 
uniquc In that il publishes only the 
work of undergraduatc ... 

POllldexttr is open to any under-
graduate in any nalion and currntly 
has editors from the United State 
and England. It actively recruits 
UC D students for submissions 
through fliers, e-mail announce-
ments and word of mouth. 

"One of the rea ons we started 
Pomdexter in the fir t place was 
because we felt that a lot of the 
undergraduate work we saw float-
ing around in our dorms, in class-
room, on thc Internet and in our 
local campus publications was real -
ly exc1 lent and deserved a wider 
audience," said Chris Goodmachcr, 
a Dartmouth College junior and a 
founding editor of Pomdexur. 

Poindrxter is run and edited 
without a central office. Meetings 
are held weekly using America 
Online Instant Messenger, where 
edilOrs decide on which submitted 
student works to POSt on the site . 

"As a journal about ' intercolle-
glatc' comillun ication, I think it is 
ea,ier for us to have communica-
tion betwcen campuses sin e we're 
online," said 'Tim Lcc, a junior at 
Unlversiry of Illinois, Urbana-
Champagne. "1 laving students 
from variou universitie form a 
dialogue, they are able to gain a 
broader under tanding of the way 
others think." 

Each week, Pomdexter is updat-
ed with new submissions. The 
process is very much like updating 
a Web log, a type of online person-
al journal often referred to as a 
"blog." 

Many popular Web log commu-
nities are free to join and they offer 
the u er a personal page with a lim-
ited amount of space and a tem-
plate to POSt logs. 0 knowledge of 
Web design is required 

George areewong, a third 

year Interdisciplinary Computing 
and the Arts major, has a personal 
Web si te where he displays projects 
from his rCAM classes and displays 
videos and pictures that he has 
made. 

"The whole site is my creation," 
aid Nareewong. "rt IS my way of 

feeling and learnmg the world." 
areewong's Web site has links 

to several friends' sites and Web 
logs. One linX in particular is to 

tella Ly's Web log. 
"It i pretty fun and easy If you 

are interested in It," aid tella Ly, 
an Eleanor Roosevelt College 
junior. 

Random people as well a 
friends regularly comment on her 
mes ages. In a recent entry, Ly 
wTOte, "I don't write in my blog for 
you okay? I wTite it for myself." 

Chuse and Liquor is a literary 
journal founded by UCSD students 
that publishes a print edition quar-
terly and lvill go online this month. 
It wi 11 act as a promotion for the 
printed i ue by giving general 
information and links to online lit-
erary works while giving students 
more options to exhibit their work.

Spinning the wheel of fortune, winning big bucks 
Excitement proves to be the secret to getting your 15 minutes of fame 

"Ilogwart's chool on \ 'i tchcraft 
and \\'jardrv l"

strong audience watchmg the 
"Wheel of Forrune" taping at the

\\"3 my cro~ning aclue\·ement. The 
ape~ of mr 15 minutes of fame. 11 
\\'3 one of the longest puzzles of the 
da\', and I solved it. 

. Though I got through a couple 
more puu.les after that, it \\"a baSI-
cally downhill from there. 

A couple weeks earlier, I aw the 
"Wheel 10bile" at the bottom of 
the Gci el Library snake path . 
Employees from the local NBC ta-
tion were holding audi tions for 
"\\'heel ofForrune'" College \Veek, 
and UC D wa one of the audition 
sites. I had an hour unol class, so I 
filled out one of the po leard-sized 
entry forms. One after another, peo-
ple went on tage to play a mock 
game on "\\'heel of Forrune," after 
saling their names and briefly mtro-
ducmg thernseh-es. 

The host asked each comestant, 
.. 0, whar do you hke to do in your 
free ome~" . . 

Rc pom..:s vaned from "I watch 
'\-\ 'heel of Forrune' all dayl" to "I 
tutor thml graders" to "I like to get 
drunk I " 

After the mtroductions, a hort 
game of "\\!heel of Forrune" was 
pl3yed, during which the comestants 
were supposed to act thrilled out of 
their n1Inds that they had just won 
such phenomenal prizes as a belr 

pack, T- hirt or a pie from Coco's. 
T he ecret to getting picked for 

the next round of auditions wa 
threefold . Fir t, enun iate the let-
rer clearly during the game. 

eeond, act really excited when )'ou 
~;n a Coco's pie. Third, pick omc-
thing more origmal than "1 Itke to 
get drunk" when asked to say 
somethmg "mtereStl ng" about 
your elf. 

The next round of auditions was 
held at The Marnott hotel down-
town. About 70 comestants from a 
half-dozen colleges filled the room 
where we played some more mock 
game, calli ng out letters and gi l'-
ing more mtroductions. T hen we 
took a five minute written exam 
consis ting of 16 "\Vheel of 
Forrune"- tyle puzzles. Apparently 
accuracy didn't count, since I only 
gOt three correct and yet I made 
the cut to the final round of audi-
tions. My hypothe is i that the 
how's producers want the viewer 

at horne to feel marter than the 
people on TV, so they intentionally 
pick some of the lOW-SCOring con-
te tants to be on the show. 

Half of the room was sent home, 
and the remaming 30 people played 
yet more round of " \ \!heel of 
Fortune" and Introduced thernselve 
one more time. Some really strange 
people showed up to the audlOon. 
There were o rne cool people from 
UC D, but some ab olutely bizarre 
characters from San Diego State. 
One guy kept yelling "busted!" every 
time someone missed a letter. 

" The show's producers 
want the viewers at 

hmne to feel smarter than 
the people on IV, so 
t11ey intentionally pick 

some of the low, coring 
contestants UJ be on t11e 

how " s . 
Another fell o n the ground during 
his game, when he pretended to spin 
an Imaginary wheel. 

I gOI a call a few days la ter let-
ting me know that I was selected to 
be on the show. I momentarily for -
got the second secret of being on 
"Wheel of ForTUne" - act really 
excited when nothing much has 
happened yet. The woman on the 
other end of the line fclt compelled 

to ask, "Daniel, you're excited, 
right? [juSt told you you're going 
to be on TV: You're excited?" he 
probably thought she'd made a 
mistake and accidentally called one 
of the people who didn 't jump up 
and down like psychopaths during 
the auditions. 

At the taping itself, we were 
explicitly told to follow the second 
ecret of being on "Wheel of 

Fortune." Evidently, it is very 
important to the show':> producers 
that the contestants never stOP clap-
ping and "celebrate" after every puz-
zle solved. The bigger the celebra-
tion, the more pleased tile show's 
operators are. That's why I leapt in 
the air and cheered maniacally after 
every spin. 

Although the actual taping was-
n't until 5 p.m. or so, the contes-
tants had to arrive at the San Diego 
Convention Center at 9 a.m. We 
were forbidden to bring out ide 
reading material , lest we glean 
some unfair advantage from read-
ing a phrase in the newspaper that 
could later be used on the show. 
The contestants were also forbid -
den to communicare with any non -
contestants until after they had 
competed . ony, the corporate 
owner of "Wheel of Fortune," had 
hired outside security and indepen-
dem investigators to ensure that no 
contestant would come into con-
tact with unauthorized persons. 

In the hours before the show, we 
were mostly kept upstairs in a hold-
ing area where the crew explained 

the rules of the game and gave us 
free food . We toured the se t and 
gOt to practice spinning the wheel , 
which is smaller than ir looks on 
Tv, bur also much heavier. Pretty 
much everything on Ihe se t is 
smaller than illo ks on TV, includ-
ing Pat Sajak and Vanna White. 

Pat and Vanna changeel clothes 
five times that day - once for each 
episode, so it would look like they 
were spending a whole week in San 
Diego. "Wheel of Fortune's" 
College Week, broadcasted during 
the econd week in May, wa filmed 
over the course of five hours on a 
Sunday in March. 

My episode was the second-to-
last, broadcast on May 15. I won 
most of the puzzles and advanced 
to the final bonus round. There. [ 
screwed up royally and missed the 
phrase "Enjoy the how." But [ 
still walked away with $11,300, so I 
wasn't exactly a failure . Every one 
of the contestants got alleast $500. 
Plus, we got on national television. 
A lady in the audience asked me for 
my autograph as she left the con-
vention center, and people honked 
their car horns and waved at me 
and the other contestant in the 
parking lot. For about 20 minutes, 
3,000 people knew our names. 

More than a couple UC D stu-
dents watched College Week. ome 
of them greet me with a loud "Enjoy 
the show!" when I walk through 
campus. That's fine by me; [ return 
the salutation and call out, "Eleven 
thousand dollars! Have a nice day!"

year in England . 

While many travelers have 
fears of traveling to the Middle 
East, the number of applicanlS 
for Egypt (one of only two 
Middle Ea stern countries in 
which EAP currently has an 
active program) has gone up. 

" ormally there are two to 
three applicants, and this year 
there were eight," Burton said. 

As for Turkey, the other 
Middle E:tstcrn country, there was 
one applicant, when there are typ-
ically two or three. 

According to Joan Adamo, the 
Turkey advisor at the Programs 
Abroad Office, "It's only because 
people haven't found out what a 
great place it is." 

ormally, there is a 20 to 25 
percent withdrawal rate from 
EAP for a number of reasons. 
Because the students must apply 
nine months in advance, their 
lives can change within that time.

"Sometimes, because the stu-
dem changed their major, they will 
switch programs," Burton said. 
"Financial changes will cause Stu-
dents to defer or go for a more 
reasonably priced program. It is 
for personal reasons, such as if 
they have a significant other they 
don't want to leave or are involved 
in a sports team. They may also 
help their families if they have had 
accidents or illnesses. Sometimes 
students and their parents are 
afraid of the political dimate." 

In addition, some students may 
no longer meet the language or 
GPA requirements of the pro-
gram. According to Burton, this 
year's withdrawal rate has been the 
same as the last couple of years. 

The obstacles faced by stu-
dents have not kept all students 
from pursuing their education 
abroad . In fact, the number of 
EAP participants at UCSD is 
increasing by 50 to 100 students 
per year. Next year, around 500 
UCSD students will go abroad . 

Burton believes that the 
increasing interest in the study 
abroad program is a good sign. 

"It is becoming more impor-
tant than ever that students get 
some kind of an international 
education in light of what's 
going on in the world," she said. 

To prepare for their experi-
ences, the students have already 
begun an orientation process. 
They have also been given pack-
ets of information on cross-cul-
tural adjustment, safety and 
health to help them adjust to life 
in the new country. 

"We focus on helping students 
blend into a society academically 
and personally," Burton said. "We 
want them to have as much of a 
non-American experience as possi-
ble and go where the natives go, 
not where the tourists go. We also 
suggest that they not wear their 
UCSD sweatshirts and dress like 
native students so they are less 
likely to be a target if anyone is 
looking for Americans as targets. 
The students need to learn what 
the norms are in the other soci-
ety." 

Once students arrive in the 
host country, they will have a final 
orientation with the host country 
and UCSD faculty to help them 
complete the transition. 

While some travelers and 
students may not feel comfort-
able traveling abroad in the 
coming year, many students are 
prepared to look forward to 
studying and immersing them-
selves in foreign cu lture and 
environment.

NBA FINALS COMMENTARY 

San Antonio Spurs will face New Jersey in 2003 Finals 
Jason Kidd and the Nets don't 
have a chance against the Spurs 

By JOSH CROUSE 
Senior Staff Writer 

The cw Jersey et~ are on a hot 
sueak. They've won 10 games in a row and 
beat up on the o. I-seeded Detroit 
Pi tons en route to the finals . That being 
said, they don't have a chance of besting the 

an Antoruo Spurs. 
The pnde of an Antonio ha beaten the 

be t teams in the BA on their way to what 
\\~ll he theIr econd title in five years. After 
dOing awa), with a pes!..·), Phoenix tcam, the 

purs bcat the defendmg world champions 
and took out the most exciting team In bas-
ketball , the Laker and Ma\'S, respecovely. 
Unfortunately for Cts fans, \Vestern dom-

his fina l year make him a dangerou pres-
ence in the low post. 

Tony Parker has emerged as one of the 
mo t solid, consis tent point guards in t he 
league, lIe is no Jason Kidd, bur he does 
wh at his team needs him to do. Paired 
with Ginobili, tephen Jackson, Steve 
Kerr and Steve Smith, the purs have a 
quintet of shooters that can make any 
team respect the inside game of Duncan 
and Robinson. 

While the Spurs' offense has been 
tremendou this postseason, the team 
alway goes back to it staple of defense. 
Leading the way In the defensive charge is 
Duncan, who ha the ability to alte r any 
shot, even if it is only the fear of a block. 

Right behind him IS Bruce 

ew Jersey did manage 
a split with the Spurs in 
two games durmg the reg-
ular eason, but that stat is 
somewhat misleading.

in the league (Bowen has

the Spurs' arsenal). Malik

also adds to the purs ' tall, 
physical defense, which 
should have its way With

running on all cylinders, as they are now, 
they teamrolled the et by 14 in an 
AntOOlO, holdmg the "potent" ew Jersey 
attack to only 78 poi nts. 

Tim Duncan stands alone as the emo-
tional and physical leader of the purs. He 
IS the league's MVP for the econd craight 
year and IS one of the most dominant play-
er that the league has seen in a while 
(relax, I saId onf of the most). The fact 
remains that Duncan IS a near-unstoppable

New Jersey can stop the Western 
Conference Champs with its defense 

By EVAN McLAUGHLIN 
Senior Staff Writer 

The NBA Finals have, by and large, been 
a David and Goliath battle since the great 
Bulls teams, featuring H is Airness, won their 
las t championship in 1998. The Western 
Confe rence has manufactured a world 
champion every year since, while the Eastern 
Conference has been a breeding ground for 
mediocrity. T he brand of basketba ll in the 
East has been bush league since, while the 
argument that whoever emerges from the 
West has a free ticket to a Di neyland com-
mercial has grown stronger with time. 

The San Anronio Spurs werc the fi rst 
team to capture tlle crown after j ordan left 
Chicago with six rings, when they won in 
1999. n June 4, the purs wi ll lace up their 

ikes before taking the floor for Game I 
again t the ew j ersey Nets en route to 
their second title in five years. Or will they? 

No, no they won't. 
The ets will have to play superior inte-

rior defense and capitalize on the play-mak-
ing abilities of point guard J a on Kidd if 
they are going to defy the overwhelming 
amount of critics who feel the BA champi-
onship was decided on May 29 when the 
Spurs knocked off the Dallas Mavericks -
but they are up to the rask. 

Wlule the Nets will be representing the 
East in the fi nals, theJer ey style of hoops is 
fa r from representa tive of the low-scoring, 
wind-and-grind methods employed by their 
conference colleagues. T he ets have per-
fec ted thei r up-tempo offense during Kidd 's 
second yea r on the team. Ln 2002-03, the 

ets ran the floor better than any other 
team tn the league, where hIgh-flye r 
Kenyon M artin, Richard J efferson and 
Kerry Kittles fini hed their fas t breaks. 

peaking of Kidd, he is hands down the 
best po lilt guanl 111 the NBA. The , ets 
franchise \VJ" tn Cllpperville until he 
showed up in 200 1. Kldd has made hIS 
teammates bellcr b)' creating open shots for 
them on offcn;,c .lnd by pro\~ding the on-
court leadership that IS hardly ~ecn 111 pro 
ball these dars. H IS passmg savvy, basketball 
~marts and sheer qUlckne arc unmatched 

by anybody not named Isiah. 
But Kidd alone, as valuable as he is to the 

N ets championship, cannot win tlle ti tle by 
himsel f. T he purs are the mo t talented 
team in the league and will rely on the low-
post scoring of power forward Tim Duncan. 
Nets coach Byron cott said that Martin wi ll 
be defending Duncan one-on-one during the 
fi nals, bur not if they want to win . Although 
Martin is an awesome defender, he would be 
chewed up if he has to guard Duncan solo. 

T he Nets may want to consider the 
kami kaze approach Mavs coach D on elson 
employed against Duncan. T he Mavs tripl e-
teamed Dunca n in the post, forci ng the rest 
of the Spll rs ro beat them. Dallas was a 
weaker team than tllC ets defensively, but 
putting the pressure on a 2 1-year-old (Tony 
Parker) and an BA ncwcomer (Elllanuel 
Ginobi li) in the bIggest series of Iheir live 
mIght not be a bad idea . rf the ets fo rce 
the ball Out of Duncan's hands and fire up 
the struggling Dikembe Murombo to p lay 
like the defensive stalwart he once was down 
the su etch, D uncan can be contained. 

The biggest weakness an ntonio has is 
their recent inability to hold a lea d in the 
fourth quarter and close Out games. No one 
could better exploit this Achi lles' heel than 
Kidd himsel f. He will be the igni tion to at 
least two come-from-be hind ~ctories in th is 
series. Don't blink during the fourth quarter, 
because that's just as long a he' ll need to take 
back a lead. Whil e the biggest knock on Kidd 
is that he i n't a very consistent shooter, he 
has shown that he has the stones to take and 
make the cl utch shot, just like Detroit 
learned in Game I of the Eastern finals. 

The ets will win this se ries. T he loss suf-
fered to the Lakers in 2002 did nothing but 
whet the appeti te for a team ~th everything 
to prove. Marti n must prove that he is more 
than JUSt a chest-thumping bea t. Kidd must 
prove that he I among the gre,ltest in our era,

tance runner in track, but also 
excelled at cros country. 1 r is long-
te rm commitment to th e tea m 
enabled him to showcase his skills 
in Di~sion III and further hone 
them at the Division n leve l. 

"David Dunbar was the first 
UCSD runner to be an AlI -
American when we became a 
Division n school," Salerno said . 

Another distance runner, 
Shapiro, was also a consistent per-
former whose time and attention to 
his chosen sport was validated by a 
strong perform:lnce at the confer-
ence championships. 

Long, though !mown primarily 
as a jumper, was an athlete adapt-
able to the conditions of many 
other events, and was prized by the 
team for assisting in events that 
were undermanned. 

"An amazingly versatile athlete, 
he pole vaulted, ran relays, jumped 
in different events. He covered a 
lot of spaces," Salerno said. 

Long plans on attending gradu-
ate school and focusing on 
research. 

Takayama served the crack team 
as a top sprinter, one who helped 
the team rankings considerably as a 
team player, but whose individual 
efforts are also evident in the top 10 
all-time marks at UCSD. 

Talc.aY3ma has post-graduating 
plans to join the Peace Corps in 
Africa. 

Denes was a supe! ;or 100- and 
200-meter sprinter whose efforts 
and team leadership were applaud-
ed ~y Salerno. . 

Sam was a consIstent per-
former and team leader who 
bridged the gap into Division ll," 
Salerno said. 

Leyking was another four-year 
sprinter who took his team respon-
sib ilities erious]y, something vali-
dated by the fact that he was also a 
repeated letter wi nner. 

" He was a tremendous positive 
influence," Salerno said. 

Distance runner Parisi was a 
juni or co llege transfer who was not 
only an excell e nt 800-meter run-
ne r, bur also a dedica ted member of 
the 4x400-ll1e ter relay. 

On the wom en's side, there are 
nine seniors, each of whom made a 
powerful and unique conuibution 

. to the success of the team over the 
pa t four years. 

Lisa Caldwell was a versatile 
champion in events such as the 
jave lin. hurdles and relays. 
Ilowever, her specialties were the 
hurdles and jave lin. 

J ackie Vu 's superior skills in the 
pole vault enabled her to be a 
repeated school record holder in 
her chosen event, with several 
showings on the UCSD all -time 
list. 

Kelly Mimnaugh, another (21 -
ented pole vaulter, was also a 
prime team member and a potent 
scorer. 

"Kelly was a very effective scor-
er who made her personal record at

her second conference champi-
onship," Salerno said. 

Mimnaugh and her senior team-
mate, Juliana Mittino, were named 
outstanding performers, as was 
their sophomore teammate Kendra 
Canape. 

Mittino is another eJ(cellent 
pole vaulter who was awarded 
many times for her athletic capabil-
ities. 

High jumper Zita Dixon soared 
to victory many times in her acco-
lade-filled run for UCSD. 

Clara Wilson is an athlete who 
applied herself in many events, but 
specialized in both the hurdles and 
jumps. 

Senior sprinter Erin Newman 
was both a dedicated team leader 
and an accomplished athlete of 
many colors. 

"She was a great team leader 
who helped bridge the gap from 
Division 1Il to Division 11 and con-
uibuted in many events," Sa lerno 
said . 

ara Allsup is an experienced 
athle te who was a two-time AlI-
American in discus, made the 
UC SD all -time list in four di ffere nt 
event , and has post-graduation 
plans for a career in teaching. 

Last week at nationals, Allsup 
improved on her performance 
from a year ago by fini hing sixth 
and earning All -American recog-
nition for a second con ecutive 
year with a mark of 152'4" in the 
discus . 

"She was an exceptional nation-
al athlete," Salerno said. 

Another exceptional athlete was 
undoubtedl y Audrey ung. ung 
was a three-time All -American in 
crack and was also an All -American 
on the cross country team. 

She not only left a powerful 
mark athletically, but also acade-
mically, with a high GPA that 
earned her the status as a tOP 
national scholar-athlete. 

Last week, Sung gave an AlI-
American perfonnance in her spe-
cialty, the 3,000, with a fifth-place

Points: An exception to 
jumping onto the bandwagon 

cominued from page 20 
and better things coming into this 
year, and now I'm about as ure of 
it as I am that the Spurs will have 
their way with the Nets. Although 
thi s year' freshman class won't 
even witness the Tritons reaching 
the end of the road, the path should 
lead the Tritons into a DI confer-
en e (as uming that the athle ti 
department gets the extra cash that 
r think it will from boosters and 
Chancellor Robert C. Dynes). 

It 's hard to get excited about an 
athl e tics 1)logram that compete 
again t teams frol1\ fine cities like 
D tmnguez Ilill and Baker fi eld , 
Calif., but the performan e of ome 

of this year's Tritons and their 
future is worth cheering for. 

Bandwagoners are one of a few 
things in sports that I can't stand, but 
I wouldn't mind if people jumped on 
it here at UCSD. There needs to be 
a reason to climb into the wagon that 
SoCal fans !mow so well (I wonder 
how many of the people at Edison 
foield and the Pond were Angels and 
Ducks fans two seasons ago), and the 
reason to get on with the Tritons 
should be coming.

malls about his points at adku-

Swimming's 
Delurgio is a 
Face in the 

Crowd 

From the 
Front Row 

Bryce Warwick 

P ick up a copy of the June 2 is ue of ports Illustrated and you'll read about her 13 
pages before Mamn Brodeur, 15 
pages before Annika orenstam 
and 34 pages before Roger 
Clemens. Granted, Clemens has 
Iu face on the cover, bur he doesn't 
have the smile. It' the blg, warm, 
genullle smde of Rp anna DelurglO 
that pulls you in. It's what he's 
done thar keep you readlllg. 

Delurglo - a sophomore human 
de\'elopment malor at John .\lUJr 
College - won naDonal champl-
onslups m both the 100- and ~oo­
yard breaststroke thl spnng, and as 
lf that weren't enough, she set new 
Di\lslon IT record m each. Those 
accompli hmen~ earned her a pot 
III t1us wtel· "Faces of the Crowd" 
sccoon of I. and If you don·r Wlder-
stand wh} she's millllg yet, consider 
where she was JUSt rwo years ago. 

Transltlonlllg between water 
polo and s"~m seasons her seruor 
year at Santa Cruz's oquel High 

chool, DelurglO was pushed too 
hard, too fast and developed 
inflaml1l.ltion 1Il her shoulder that 
limited her ability to compete, and 
took away her joy for the sport. 

"My passion for sWlmmlllg 
land of died off because of [the 
lIlJury)." Delurgio said. "\-Vhen you 
aren't gernng any reward or you 
can't even try your best because it 
hurts too much, it kind of makes 
you not want to do it anymore." 

In spite of the injuries, Delurgio 
still had plenty of options for col-
lege. he considered such Division 
I schools as UCLA and USC, but 
she didn't like what she found there. 

"It JUSt seemed like the intimacy 
level between the wimmers and 
the coaches wasn't as oght," she 
sald. "They couldn't talk to each 
other about other thmgs besides 
swimrrung." 

At UCSD and in Triton head 
coach Scon McGihon, Delurgio 
found a program and a coach that 
Wlder tood her needs and let her 
rediscover the joy of swimming. 
The relationship has worked out 
well for both - with Delurgio 
shredding the record books and the 
Tritons placing a strong third in this 
years national championship meet. 

Naoonal championships are nice, 
but It's easy for me to look into her 
ey and tell that she wants some-
thing morc. There' a drive there 
that pushes Delurgio beyond the 
borders of competition. Across bor-
der and oceans lies Athens, Greece 
- the site of the 2004 Summer 
Olympics - a place Delurgio might 
find herself in her dreams if she 
allowed them to drift that far. 

But she doesn't. For now, the 
biggest talk she'll allow herself is of 
OlympiC trJals. 

"It's rea Iy hard to admit you 
want something so badly and then 
to fad at it," she reminds me. 

"Yes Rosanna," I think to 
myself. "But wouldn't it be great to 
show the world your smile?"

Tritons earn academic awards 
Seven athletes strong on and off the field 

By CYNTHIA CHAVEZ 
Staff Writer 

While being key assets to 
their teams, seven Triton athletes 
proved their competence outside 
their re pective ports by receiv-

SENIOR SENDom 

Crew seniors row off into the sunset 
Five from UCSD men's team will graduate 

By AMBER MAmN 
Staff Writer 

UCSD men's crew wiU gradu-
ate five seruors at the end of the 
spring quarter: Leo Shook, Dan 
Toth, Scott Destafney, Patrick 
Gruwell and Robert Babcock. 

"At the end of the season, the 
varsity four proved we had 
Division I speed in our pro-
gram," said UCSD head coach 
Michael Filippone. 

Shook., Toth and Destafney 
also helped row the varsity four 
into a first-place finish at the West 
Coast Rowing Championships 
and intO the grand finals at the 
Pacific Coast Rowing 
Championships and Pac-lOs. 

Additionally, Destafney sacri-
ficed to help the varsity eight 
when he switched from rowing 
starboard to port in his senior 
year after rowlng starboard dur-
ing his entire rowlIlg career. 

"It is difficult for an athlete to 
change sldes. It works completely 
different muscles and uses oppo-
site movements. It just shows the 
athlete Scott is," Filippone said. 

Shook, the bow seat of the 
varsity four, was elected as the 
team's most inspirational rower 
this year and last. 

"[He's] not only a stellar ath-
lete, but a hard worker with a 
great attitude," Filippone said. 

A transfer out of Orange 
Coast College, Toth decided to 
concentrate on academics his 
first year at UCSD and forgo 
rowing. In his first season with 
the Tritons, he aided both the 
varsity eight and four. 

"Da.n had a great career with 
Orange Coast and we really could 
have used him last year," 
Fllippone ald . "lie was an asset 
to the team this year and we are 
glad he made the decision to row." 

Babcock took part in the varsi-

ty eight at different meets 
throughout the season and was 
described by Filippone as "a really 
solid athlete," and was "pleased to 
have such an all-around great ath-
lete on the team." 

Beginning his career last year 
as a junior, Gruwell was a mem-
ber of the novice eight and 
received a bid to the national 
championships after wining the 
Newport Invitational and com-
ing in second at the Western 
Intercollegiate Rowing 
Association championships. 
Gruwell also received the honor 
of "UCSD scholar-athlete of the 
year" this season. 

"Overall this is a great group 
of seniors," Filippone said. "I 
would have loved to go faster in 
the eight at the end of the season 
before these guys left, but they 
are all great athletes who worked 
hard all year and during their 
entire UC 0 rowing career."

Senior sendoffs fill the sports section. Tritons are anending their respective end-of-the-

The U SD track and field 
team will see a total of 16 athletes 
graduate this year, all of whom 
were strong contributors to a pro-
gram that has seen many changes 
in the pa t four years. During the 
recent change from Division III to 
Division II , the graduating ath-
letes helped to "bridge the gap," 
according to head coach Tony 
Salerno, and each athlete is 
notable for the unique III ight he 
or she has brought to the team as a 
whole. 

On the mens side, there will be 
seven graduating, including David 
Dunbar, David Long, Alan 
Shapiro, Trevor Takayama, am
