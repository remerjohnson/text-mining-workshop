PRINCETON, N.J. - Last 
Tuesday, Princeton 
University music professor 
Peter Jeffery tiled suit 
against the Smashing 
Pumpkins. as well as several 
other organizations, for 
alleged damage inllicted on 
his hearing at a rock concert 
he attended two years ago. 
Anthony Wallace, Jellery's 
attorney, said his client 
prefers Gregorian chants and 
folk music, and consequently, 
he had never attended a rock 
concert before. As a result. 
he did not expect the decibel 
intensity he experienced 
when he took· his 12-year-old 
son to a Smashing Pumpkins 
show on Jan . 25, 1997. Now, 
Jeffery alleges that his hear-
ing was pennanently dam-
aged and he suffers from 
tenitis, an aflliction that 
results in constant ringing in 
his left ear.

A.S. Council Votes to Place 
Neither Constitution on Ballot 

-DEBATE: McKoon submitted a 
second constitution for council 
members to vote on last Wednesday 
By Vincent arenanl 
Senior Staff Writer 

The A.S. Council voted last week to rescind a 
vote that would have placed a proposed A.S. 
Constitution, which was authored by A.S. 
President Joe Leven!hal and A.S. Vice President 
Finance Pat Ru. on the ballot. The move to place 
the constitution on the ballot had been approved 
two weeks earlier. 

A.S. Vice President Internal Kim McKoon 
also submitted a second constitution on 
Wednesday. A.S. Council members unanimously 
agreed to debale both constitutions and place 
only one on the ballot. After some debate, the 
A.S . Council voted against placing either consti-
tution on the ballot. 

Both constitutions would have changed the 
basic structure of the A.S. Council. Under the 
proposed constitutions. commissioners who 
would be elected under the present system 

would be appointed by the A.S. president and 
vice presidents and be non-voting cabinet mem-
bers. Both constitutions also increase the number 
of senators on A.S. Council. 

Ru cow rote both constitutions. He said that 
while he approved of the one written with 
Leventhal, he preferred the one written with 
McKoon. 

"The first constitution I worked on is better 
than the current one," Ru said. "But the one that 
[McKoonl and I worked on was what I actually 
wanted." 

McKoon's constitution included bylaws 
which defined - among other things - the roles 
of each office, including newly created senators, 
the rules and procedures of debate and the duties 
of committees. 

. Ru said that the inclusion of bylaws in the 
constilution is necessary in order to define the 
roles of new A.S. Council members. 

"You need to have bylaws ready and in 
place," Ru said. ''They can always change it, but 
when you first get into office you need structured 
bylaws."

Nobel Laureate 
Crick Lectured 
AtUCSD 
SCIENCE: Researcher, who 
helped uncover the structure of 
DNA in 1953, spoke to over 300 
By Christine La Grange 
Guardian Reporter 

World-renowned scientist Francis Crick 
spoke to a crowd of over 300 people at 
Liebow auditorium on Friday. The lecture. 
titled "Consciousness: Recent Ideas and 
Experiments" was part of the 1999 Stephen 
W. Kuffler Series. 

Crick is a member of the Watson and Crick 
team, the Nobel Prize winning duo who dis-
covered the structure of DNA in 1953. 

"He's in every biology book," said David 
Zohrabian, a Muir junior. "Every time they 
talk about DNA it's him they mention. So 
basically .. . he's immortalized." 

The main topic of Crick's lecture was the 
Neural Correlate of Consciousness (NCe) 
which scientists have been trying to localize 
in the brain. The NCC is difficult to locate, 
according to Crick, because it probably 
exists in many different parts of the brain. 

"Consciousness is not likely to be in a 
single place." Crick said. "The strongest 
evidence we have for that is brain damage, 
and more recently. from scans of people. So 
it's not going to be in a single, cortical area." 

Crick discussed experiments that have 
been done, and ones which could be used in 
the future to pinpoint the NCC. Some of the 
experiments he mentioned involved visual 
input, anesthesia and binocular ri valry in 
humans and primates. 

"We've gotten a glimpse of the range of 
experiments that could be done," Crick said. 
"But the plain facl is, only a few of them arc 
being done." 

Crick said that while additional experi -
ments and new methods are needed to learn 
more about the NCC, the fact that scientists 
are even designing experiments to locate the 
NCC is a milestone in itself. 

'1'he experiments are beginning to look for 
the NCC, it's not just. a matter of people dis-
cussing it and producing ideas," Crick said. 
"There are actually experiments being 
designed. Even if the ones about the NCC are 
too vague and confused, at least we can start 
nibbling at tbe problem by doing experiments." 

Crick emphasized the complexity of con-
sciousness and the importance of continuing 
the experiments. He also said that under-
standing how neurons in the brain interact 
and fire is a crucial component in under-
standing the NCe. 

"We have to realize that whatever the 
NCC is, it's not going to be simple," Crick 
said. "It may involve certain types of neu-
rons, but the way that they interact and talk 
to each other may be rather complex. That's 
why we're still groping."

UCSD Receives Gnmt For Dialogue 
UCSD has received $863,000 from the Pew 

Charitable Trusts to fund a civic effort that will initiate 
a new dialogue between UCSD faculty and the San 
Diego community, with the aim of better integrating 
the university's research and teaching expertise with 
community needs and interests. 

The three-year inittative will be launched under the 
newly created UCSD Civic Collaborative, to be directed 
by Mary Walshok, associate vice chance/for for 
extended studies and professor of sociology, and 
Michael Schudson, professor in the division of social 
sciences. The effort will include the development of a 
community·focused research agenda, academic semi-
nars, community roundtables, neighborhood dia-
logues and consensus building. 

Schudson is the author of the recent book "The 
Good Citizen: A History of American Civic Life" and is 
the recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship. He said the 
first step of the project will be a major effort to solic· 
it the opinions of members of the community from a 
wide range of neighborhoods. 

National research and public opinion expert Daniel 
Yankelovich is also a project director and will be facil· 
itatlng the neighborhood dialogues and the consensus 
building efforts. 

The Pew Charitable Trusts is one of the nation 's 
largest philanthropies and supports non-profit activi· 
ties in culture. education, the envirC'nment, health and 
human services. public policy and religion. Based in 
Philadelphia, the Trusts make investments to encour· 
age civic engagement in addressing critical issues and 
effecting social change.

Birch Aquarium Will Hold 
Wildlife Events this Month 

Students are invited to join the Birch Aquarium at 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography in March for an 
ocean cruise to look for gray whales returning north 
with their calves. They can search the high seas for the 
characteristic paired blows of a mother leading her calf 
on its first journey to their feeding grounds in the Arctic. 

Scripps naturalists will share newfound knowledge 
regarding the gray whale's first year of life as learned 
from "JJ" - the baby gray whale rescued by Sea 
World last year. 

This event is open to all ages five and older. Adults 
must accompany children. Aquarium cruises are being 
offered Saturday, March 13 and Sunday, March 14 
from 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. For reservations and infor· 
mation, call 224·7767. 

Birch Aquarium is also sponsoring a grunion run on 
Saturday, March 20 from 10 p.m. to 12 a.m. 

Grunion are small, silver fish that are often left 
stranded on sandy beaches following certain high 
tides. While on the beach, female grunion bury them-
selves in the sand to lay eggs. Then they return to 
sea. 

A lecture and film on grunion and marine biolumi-
nescence will precede ~he moonlight e,xpforation of 
Scripps beach. The fee for the grunion run is $9 for 
adults and $5 for children ages 7-13. Advance reser· 
vations are required. For mOle information, call 534-

Preuss School Taking Applications 
EDUCATION: Eligible 
students must meet 
certain requirements 
By .... Montemeyor 
Staff Writer 

Applications for admissions to 
the Preuss School. UCSD's charter 
school 'project, are being accepted 
until Man:h 12. The Preuss School, 
the first charter school in California 
to be located on a college campus, 
will officially begin classes this fall. 

During its first year, the school 
will teach sixth, seventh and eighth 
grade. A new grade level will be 
'added each year until 700 students 
are enrolled, which is estimated to 
occur by the year 2003. 

RESEARCH: 
Students said they 
were fascinated 
Cwl ••• drr... ..... l 

Crick's audience ranged from 
doctors and scientists to undergrad-
uates. Some students said they 
found him fascinating. while others 
said they were overwhelmed. 
Almost all said they came to see 
him based on his fame and reputa-
tion as one of the world's most 
accomplished scientists. 

'" came here to see him because 
he'nhe DNA guy." said Mauricio 
Dejowhich, a Revelle senior. 
"Otherwise. he blew my mind. , 
didn't follow that much; I guess 
he's totally out of my league."

To be eligible to attend the 
Preuss School, students must meet 
several requirements which include 
motivation and academic potential 
to attend a competitive college or 
university. parents or guardians 
who have not graduated from a 
four-year college or university. and 
eligibility for a free or reduced-
price lunch program. The first 100 
students accepted into the school 
will be selected via lottery. 

It will take a little over a year to 
build the school. with construction 
starting this spring and completion 
set for fall 2000. Until the permanent 
site is erected. students will tem-
porarily reside in modular buildings 
and in the La Casa Complex on the 
Thurgood Marshall campus. 

David Zohrabian said he had 
similar sentiments. 

"I'm an undergrad so most of it 
was over my head, but I think he 
had a few profound things to say," 
Zohrabian said. "'think the iecture 
was mostly geared towards scien=-
tists to give them ideas. But he's 
designed so many experiments ... 
his research is the anchor of all this 
other research that's come about." 

Crick enrolled in University 
College in England at the age of 18. 
where he earned his bachelor of 
science degree for physics in 1937. 

In 1949 he joined the Medical 
Research unit at Cavendish 
Laboratory where he worked with 
other scientists on determining pro-

PINION 

Plans to expand the University 
Centers will improve and 

expand facilities at a cost. The 
expanSion has issues of 

finance and neceSSity that 
continue to be debated by the 

Un iversity Center Advisory 
Board and students. 

Sy ..... J.Crou 
Special to the Guardian 

As the Chair of the University Centers 
Advisory Board (UCAB), the organization that 
oversees operation of both the Student and Price 
Centers, it has come to my attention that some con-
cerns have been nlised by fellow students in 
respect to the proposed self-assessed student fee to 
expand the Price Center and Student Center. 

It is therefore my intention to clarify the issues 
by answering the following questions: Who will 
fund this expansion?; Is this expansion really need-
ed, and are the current spaces being used to their 
utmost efficiency?; Why is the fee collected upon 
the expansion opening?; What exactly will stu-
dents be approving; what's in the fee'! ; Who deter-
mines how the fee is spent and how the project 
prO\:eeds'! and How was Ihe fcc increase deler-
mined? 

The first question that must be dealt with is the 
matter of funding. More specifically, who can, or 
will, pay for this project? Only student fees can 
fund non-academic facilities on California cam-
puses. This policy means that students must pay 

for this proposed expansion since there are 
no other funding options available. 

Is this expansion really needed and 
are the current spaces being used to the 
utmosl efficiency '! When the Price 

Center was completed in 1989, it, along 
with the Student Center, was intended to 

serve the needs of a student body of 
16,000, beyond which UCSD has since 

grown. The effects of this increase have been 
felt by anyone who has attempted to make 

a space rese.rvation recently. Simply, the 
university no longer has Ihe space to 

accommodate everyone. 
Some may argue that people other than 

students are reserving spaces that students 
could use. The reality is that students can 

reserve a conference room up to six months in 
advance, whereas everyone else gets only six 

weeks. Another university policy protects stu-
dent priority by charging a fee to organizations 

not associated with UCSD for the use of spaces in 
the University Centers. 

In fact, staff, faculty and off-campus interests 
typically use the centers only during the hours 
before noon when most students are in class or oth-
erwise occupied .. Only an expansion, such as Ihat 

being proposed, can allow the 
university to accommodate the 

evening-meeting needs of student 
organizations. 

Why won't the fee go into effect until the 
expansion opens? Based on principle, UCAB, a 
board composed of a studenl majority and chaired 
by a student, decided that this delay was the fairest 
way to proceed in this manner. 

Regardless of the decision, the board members 
and current stu~nts would still be deciding on a 
fee increase that future students would be required 
to pay. In this way, current students would not have 
to pay for a facility they may never use. 

What elUlctly will students :lC approving? Many

HOCKEY DESERVES RESPECT 

Rs Ult/e !-Via' '-'" CATHY RAZIL 
During last month 's ESPY 

awards show (the OSl:ars for 
sports), host Samuel L. Jal:kson 
joked that one of the reasons the 
NBA had to end its lockout was 
bel:ause "the brothers were 
being fOr\:ed to watch hockey." 
It got the biggest laugh of the 
night - a huge feat for the 
deeply unfunny ESPYs - but it 
also proved a point: Many people 
will always I:onsider hockey a 
laughable game. 

So I guess I have a I:onfession to 
make: I'm a hockey fan . Yes, I've 
heard all the bad jokes (the ones 
about missing teeth; I went to a 
fight and a hockey game staJ1ed. 
hee hee) . And unfortunately, a gig-
gling real:tion is pretty mUl:h the 
standard response to any reference 
to the sport. 

I'm not quite sure exactly what 
it is about hockey that causes so 
many sports fans to ridicule it. 
Sure, if I were to say that I was a 
big supporter of the lawn mower-

. r.u.:ing league or tral:tor pulls. I 
I:ould understand getting laughed 
at. But the phrase "I like hockey" 
enl:ourages NFL, MLB and NBA 
fans to mock you, non-sports fans 
to begin lectures on the "disgrace-
ful violence" of the game and oth-
ers to smile condescendingly at 
your lowbrow taste in entertain-
ment.

strength, speed and the talent to do 
stupid things in the end zone after 
scoring, such as playing leapfrog.

they're strong, they're able to skate 
quickly and they spit "almost as 
mUl:h as baseball players do. Plus, 
the NHL boasts the greatest per-
centage of players with truly tragil: 
haircuts. 

Two, it 's boring to watch and 
there's no scoring. 

For those of you weaned on the 
NBA and its non-stop parade of 
points, it's hard to explain the 
appeal of an end score that reads 0-
o or 1-0. Amerkan sports fans 
seem to favor lots of offense, which 
may be why the equally low-scor-
ing sport of soccer has never quite 
caught on with television viewers 
in the states. Hockey is pretty excit-

voting on the plan will have grad-

have an accurate idea of nor

if today 's students did challenge 
their apathy on th is issue and 
attend UCAB meetings to provide 
their input, would future students 
be satisfied with the results'!

ey where fighting is allowed. 

I personally I:onsider hockey 
fights to be the dividing line

fans, in that casual fans regard the

If you don't like hockey, all of

DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT 
The University of California, San Diego (UCSD) has completed a Draft 
Environmental Impact Report (EIR) on the proposed Eleanor Roosevelt 
College (ERC) FacilitieslNorth Torrey Pines Parking Structure project. A 
public hearing to take testimony on the project and the Draft EIR will be 
held at the time and place stated below: 
WEDNESDAY, MARCH 24, 1_ 
4:30 p.m., c.n.., HllII, Room 201. 
Enter the campus using Gilman Drive. Turn left at Myers Drive to metered 
on-street parking. Center Hall is the large beige building with the light green 
roof. Follow the walkway along the north side of the building to the stairway 
located at the northwest corner. Take the stairs to the second story and 
follow the signs to the hearing room. 
The proposed project is located on a t 6 acre site in the northwestern 
portion of the main UCSD campus, and consists of two main compo-
nents: 1) new administrative, housing and dining facilities and 2) a new 
parking structure. The administrative, housing and dining components 
consists of 460,000 gross square feet (gsf), including a total of 1.238 
new beds in residence halls, apartments, and for upper division and 
graduate students enrolled in the college. The College Provost, aca-
demic advising and student affairs operations would also be relocated 
to the site from elsewhere on campus. These uses would be housed in 
several new structures to be developed on site with a total gsf of 20,000. 
The parking structure would contain 970 parking spaces on five parking 
levels. Two above·ground decks would be constructed over two betow· 
ground levels and the filth level would be a hall-deck accessible from 
Scholars Drive North. Additional project improvements consist of the 
closure of the Salk tnstitute Road entrance to the University and 
conslruction of a new entry road and intersection on Nonh Torrey Pines 
Road. 
The UCSD Revised and Long Range Development Plan EIR also addresses 
development at the proposed site; therefore, this project EIR is tiered from 
and focuses on the project-specific issues of land use, traffic, and circula-
tion, noise, and visual character and aesthetics. and incorporates analyses 
of other development· related issues from the prior EIA. 
Written and oral statements from interested persons or groups will be ac-
cepted at the hearing for entry into the hearing records. A transcript of the 
hearing will be included in the Final EIA. The hearing record will be kept open 
alter the public hearing untit April 8, 1999. During this period, letters and 
statements may be submitted for inclusion in the record by writing:

6 OPINION 

FLAWS: 
Student input and a 
definite plan needed 
ContInued froIII ..... I 
increase just to cover the mainte-
nam:e costs from having more stu-
dents at UCSD. But what has been 
seen in older projects at this univer-
sity and at other UC campuses tell 
of continued fcc collection with 
mai ntenance fees being di verted 
elsewhere so that not-so-new build-
ings fall into neglect. 

Ten or twenty years down the 
road, the University Centers e)(pan-
sion will haw lost il~ newne~s and 
there will be new. more expensive 
plans unda way. 

Case-In-point is RIMAe. the 
fadlity that the last fee increase 
\.lent to pay for. It IS magnifit:ent 
and house~ probabfy the greatest 
university weight room in the 
world. Most students feel fortunate 
to Ijave access to sUl:h a superb 
facility. 

However. one finds serious 
n.:gicl:t in c.:rtain area~. Bel:ause 
the dil11ate control systems were 
not properly maintained. too mUl:h 
humidity ha~ heen allowed into 
the building so that million~ of

.:d with rust. It took a wmplete 
failure of the l:limatel:ontrol sys-
tem last year for any attention to 
be given to it.

repair prol:e~~ that lasts eon~. It is 

like seeing bright yellow "OUT OF 
ORDER" tape wrapped around the 
mahogany bar of a stretched limou-
sine. 

Is this the kind of dysfunction 
that students must look forward 
with this ne)(t fee increase for the 
University Centers expansion'! 

I propose that UCAB concen-
trate it efforts, not on collecting 
more quarterly fees from students, 
but on selling the Student Center's 
name to a high-paying third party 
to make a few million dollars. 
Qualcomm Center rolls off the 
tongue nicely - most students 
wouldn't mind too much. 

Before current students decide 
to put the hard-earned dollars of 
future students on the line, the 
University Centers e)(pansion 
needs a wncrete plan and more 
student input. But. since most l:ur-
rent students will not be here 
when this plan is l:ompleted, the 
l:urrent plan will probably be 
approved without a second 
thought and $12 million in student 
money will be wasted. Who 
knows. the (;Ost could double if, 
during the construction e)(cava-
tion. the arl:hitects discover a rare 
spel:ies of earthworm that war-
rants a full-blown environmental 
sensitivity audit. 

UCAB administrators believe 
they have the answers in using a 
quarterly fee increase to build new 
student fal:ilities and refurbish 
others. They should show students 
these answers. out of res pel: t for 
their emal:iated l:hedbooks, 
before they expect students to sign 
the fUlure away at the ballot bo)(

ken fear that there is no concrete 
plan for how the money will be 
spent should the fee increase pass. 

Although UCAB does not have 
architects' sketches or schematic 
drawings to present to the student 
body, UCAB does have a sizable 
body of research and student feed-

.back, as well as a partial list of 
facilities that definitely will be 
included should the e)(pansion 
happen . 

This list includes spaces such 
as a 24-hour study lounge, a black 
box theater for student and l:ollege 
produl:tions, more space for the 
Co-ops, Soft Reserves, Lecture 
Notes and the Guardian, a Student 
Organization Center including 10 
additional student ofTices, more 
mid-sized conference rooms and 
several new food/retail concepts. 

These new spaces will help 
create an additional 50 to 60 new 
sludent jobs. As far as presenting 
schematic or concept designs, 
UCAB decided that it would be a 
waste of student funds to hire an 
arc~itect for a project that is still 
awaiting approval. 

Student users will determine 
the type and number of facilities 
induded in the e)(pansion. This 
process was essentially started 
two years ago with the Quality of 
Life Survey and has since passed 
through several student-chaired 
wmmiuees. In addition, all stu-
dents have had the opportunity to 
attend open forums and offer pub-
lic input at UCAB meetings. This

If this proposed fee increase 
passes, building advisory commit-
tees would be formed for both the 
Student and Price Centers to make ' 
decisions pertaining to the e)(pan-
sion. These committees will be 
composed of the primary users for 
each center (users such as the Co-
ops, GSA and SRTV in the 
Student Center and the AS, SAAC 
and IFClPanhelienic in the Price 
Center), as well as student repre-
sentatives drawn from interested 
parties and randomly selected stu-
dents. 

These committees would be 
l:haired by students and would 
make all of their recommenda-
tions to UCAB. UCAB would 
then make final recommendations, 
which would be passed on to Dr.

student affairs. for final IppI'OvaJ 
before being implemented. 

Another commonly expressed 
concern, pertains to the usage of 
the fee money - how much is being 
requested and how it will be spent? 
The proposed increase is $25 per 
quaner. This will be lidded to the 
current fee of $37.50 per qUarJer. 

The current fee is the second 
lowest in the UC system, and for 
that fee students enjoy one of the 
finest facilities in the country, not 
just the UC system. The current 
fee has not been increased since 
1984. Given inflation and other 
increases in the 15 years since the 
last increase, the current fee is 
barely sufficient to pay for current 
operations, much less the expan-
sion that is needed to accommo-
date UCSD's growing studem 
population. 

Arguments for the proposed 
expansion have been well thought 
out and extensively debated by 
you, the students. If, however, you 
still have questions pertaining to 
this issue please feel free to con-
tact me at bjcross@ucsd.edu or 
call me al 558-8126. You can also 
talk to your college's UCAB rep-
resentative. 

Obviously, I consider e)(pan-
sion to be vital, not only to the 
continued high quality of services 
provided by the University 
Centers, but also to any future 
e)(pansion of spaces and services. 
It is for this reason that I advise 
you to educate yourself on this 
issue and make the choice you 
perceive as most beneficial for the 
future of UCSD.

dent government." 
Dodge agreed, saying that A.S. 

Council members should have 
dealt with the constitution in a 
more objective manner. 

"I really felt everyone needed to 
take themselves out of their skin 
and think on non-personal levels." 
Dodge said. "It seemed everyone 
hac) their own personal agendas. I 
did not like the tension of 'This is 
mine, this is yours .. . , 

Leventhal said that l:ertain A.S. 
Council members have blocked 
the passage or a new constitution 
since the idea was originally pro-
posed. 

'" do feel there have been peo-
ple throughout the whole process 
who don't want to see a new con-
stitution and will go to whatever 
lengths they can to prevenl it," 
Leventhal said. 

Ru said that members should 
have spent more time debating the 
issue and that they have not been 
bold enough in their debates. 

"I felt that if anything, 
[Wednesday's debate] proved that 
council members are too polite 
with each other," Ru said. "People 
didn't want to vote one constitution 
in and not the other in order not to 
offend anyone."

MARY HIGGINS' 

N
othing short of a natural disaster can get me out of bed at 
3:30 in the morning. Yet Feb. 27, my alarm went off at the 
aforementioned time and I actually got up, threw on some 
clothes and drove to campus. My destination - the Recre-
ation AII-Nighter at RIMAC where "Most Eligible Bache-
lor" nominee Mike Cooley was scheduled to perform with 

his band Allied Sun. 
Why would I go to such extraordinary lengths to find the per-

fect bachelor'! Shortly after I announced the contest two weeks 
ago I received an e-mail from Nathan Reifke - also a junior at 
Muir - whose magnificent powers of persuasion stood out above 
all others. 

"Mike Cooley. Remember that name, because it means you 
can end your quest for a beller single guy. This guy is one of 
UCSD's finest ... 6'2", Herculean physique. brown hair, smolder-
ing eyes, great sense of humor, not to mention he loves kids, the 
beach ...... 

I thought to myself, "Yeah, right! I'll believe that when I see it!" 
Being the intrepid reporter that I am, I decided catch Cooley's act at 
RIMAe. 

When I arrived at the arena, the cards were already stacked 
against the poor guy. I was tired, cranky and on the verge of going 
home. Then, as luck would have it, I ran into a friend of mine and 
she convinced me to stick around. While we were talking, this guy 
whom I'd seen around campus said hello to my 
friend, then climbed up on stage and started 
tuning his guita: . 

My friend commented, "Mike is such a 
nice guy!" 

I stared in disbelief. 
"That's Mike Cooley'! He's the one 

I'm here to watch! ' 
I grabbed a seat in the front row and 

quickly learned that I was not wasting 
my time. As Allied Sun took the stage 
- clad in pajamas - Mike appeared 
totally at ease in the spotlight. The guy 
has a great voice, despite the fact that in 
between songs he tended to mumble inco-
herently into the microphone. (At one 
point I thought he said. "This next song is 
called Caught Me With The Provost 's 
Daughters" when what he actually said was, 
"Tbis next song is from a comm project that 
got me Provost 's Honors.") 

After the AII-Nighter, I decided that 
Mike was clearly a strong candidate - it 
was time for the interview. I called him up 
and we spoke on the phone for an hour and a 
half. Then my computer crashed and I lost 
virtually all my notes, so we had start from 
scratch. Mike took this in stride, agreeing to

ith only two days left until the March I deadline, I still had no 
nominations for "Most Eligible Bachelorelle." What was Ito 
do? Frantically, I extended the deadline and gave you people 
24 hours to cough up some contestants for me. All of a sud-
den an avalanche of nominations flooded my "in box." In 
fact, the eligible women soon out-numbered the men! It was 

a miracle! 
But now I was presented with a new problem ... whom to 

choose'! I pontificated for a week and suddenly it was time to make 
a decision. Who would the lucky bachelorelle be? 

Let me start with the Honorable Mention which goes to Muir 
sophomore Christine Gajoli, nominated by her roommate Erin 
McPeek, a junior from Muir. As much as I would have loved to have 
Christine win, my panel of judges decided she had an unfair advan-
tage because she also happens to be one of my very best friends. 
Even though she was ineligible to be "Most Eligible," Ithink she is 
still the sweetest, most generous person around and this is why I 
hang with her almost 24n. I just wanted you guys to know that. 

OK, moving on. All of the contestants seemed like really cool 
women but two contestants stood out in my mind. One woman was 
nominated by two differen~ people who each gave an extensive list 
of references. I later heard it through the grapevine that this bache-
lorette had been "campaigning" for the recognition, and there was 
no way I could let that go unrewarded! The second Bachelorette 

contender nominated herself with a long and completely 
amusing letter but she also nominated two other people 

as well! She even nominated another female in com-
petition with herself. What kind of a gutsy girl cre-
ates more competition than necessary'! 

I was equally intrigued by these two enthusiastic 
and funny females .. . therefore I based my final 

decision by creating two sub-categories: 
"Bachelorelle Who Got The Most Nomina-
tions" and "Bachelorette Who Made The 
Most Nominations." And now you are all 

dying of suspense. Who are these eligible 
women? 

Drumroll please. 
"The Bachelorette Who Got The Most 

Nominations" goes to Revelle junior Beth 
Arnesse, nominated independently by 
Genevieve Cox and SCOIl Sears. She has got to 
be the most popular woman at this school. 

The glowing nomination from ScOIl went 
as follows: "She's one of those people who 
always smiles at you ... she's willing to give up 
her time for anyone of her friends no mailer 
what obligations she has. There is no one more 
deserving than Beth Amesse." 

Gen wrote not one but two lellers saluting 
Beth 's amibutes. "She is your basic very intel-
ligent (but not at all nerdy) Revelle student.

because it was a test that

cheating, and we were 
forced to take the final

"My final was posted as

needed to walk through 
Center Hall opening every 
classroom door to find the

Gen had a few incriminating stories 
about Beth 's many drinking eXl:ursions. 
especially a specilic inl:ident at Winter-
fest, but if you want lo know the delails, 
you're going to have to ask Beth about 
them yourself. 

Because she is now one of my illustri-
ous BacheloreUe champions. I will be 
buying her dinner at the Pub on Wednes-
day. Dinner and a soda. Beth will soon be 
21, and will be hanging out with our illus-
trious features editor. Jessica Schepp-
mann, who also recently turned 21. Sadly, 
Gen will not be joining them until much, 
much later. 

And now on to our second winner. 
'The Bachelorette Who Made The Most

I'd want a preuy accepting person. 

someone who's willing to make me a part 

night, just an hour away from the extend-
ed deadline. and I was I:hecking my e-
mail. Suddenly, ) get a message from 
l'ourth-year student Suan Lee who wanted 
to make a nomination in the bachelor I:at-
egory. While I was still reading her first e-
mail. I get a second message from Suan 
because she also wanted to nominate her 
roommate Connie for the Bachelorene 

. category. Lo and behold, not half an hour 
later) receive her third and tinal nomina-
tion. 

") would like to nominate myself. I'm 
a good person on the inside and usually on 
the outside as well. J don't know that J 
would like to be known as the person who 
nominated herself and won, so I'm I:on-
tlkted." 

[Mary's Note: There is no shame in 
self-promotion! ] 

"I don't want to be a freak when) grow 
up. I'm a computer science major and I 
hate it (but now I'm stuck as a fourth year 
non-graduating senior ... and toiling to 
maintain my sucky GPA.)" 

[Mary's Note: At least you're not a 
comm major with a sucky GPA!] 

of their life, withstand my jokes. You just 
kind of know it when you find that person 
... she is someone you can spend time 
with. Do,.. .... .., ............. , 

I don't give myself enough credit and 
I'm someone who can be easily intimidat-
ed. My opinion of myself isn't bad. but I 
don't build myself up .... 

At this point. I busted out my own gui-
tar and showed him all live chords that 
I've mastered. He got bonus points for not 
laughing and pretending to recognize my 
rendition of U2's "Desire." 

So what are my impressions of Mike 
Cooley? He's reserved, but also fairly 
open about his personal life; he allowed 
me to write this column which shows he 
is a trusting person. Mike has a Zen-like 
quality about him and seems at peace 
with himself. unusual for a college stu-
dent. 

Despite the fact that he spends his free 
time shaping surfboards, Mike is about as 
far from the "surfer dude" stereotype as 
you can get. He's insightful. He's pensive . 
He pauses thoughtfully before he speaks . 
He also has a great auitude. 

'There's a wealth of awesome people 
at this school," Mike said. 'That's what I 
like about t;CSD. I'm so lucky to be 
here." 

Mike is definitely the kind of guy that 
girls notice from afar, but there is much 
more to this guy than his "Herculean 
physique." Mike Cooley ... remember that 
name. 

"1 try to live an unboring lifestyle, pos-
sessing my own snowboard ... and roller 
blading (although I have not yet learned to 
ride down stairs on them). Oh and ) took 
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu one or two quarters; 
that was an interesting experience, one 
which taught me a little self·defense. I 
believe I could break the elbow of some-
one ... but I haven't had the opportunity to 
Iry il OUI yet. BUI enough aboul the fun 
parts of life." 

All in. all, I think I liked Suan's leiters 
because lhey made me laugh the hardest. I 
also felt sorry for her because she is con-
vinl:ed she developed "I:arpal tunnel syn-
drome" while hammering out her'lhree 
nominations. 

So anyhow, congratulations to all of 
the women who were nominated. It truly 
was a tough decision to make and) spent 
an entire Saturday trying to be fair and 
unbiased. For those of you who didn't 
win (both men and women), I still hope 
everyone shows up to the Pub party on 
Wednesday. I'm looking forward to 
meeting all of you. Yours truly, The Psy-
cho Therapist.

Tritons Fall in Pitching Duel Terrific at Torrey 
COMPLETE ClAME: Gherini threw for nine innings, giving up 6 hits ONE-TWO: UCSD fmishes fIrst and second 
By lINIn Welles 
Staff Writer 

If the Tritons can shrink their 
linal deficits to one run instead of 
10, they will be in good shape this 
season and can be conlident that 
they have been playing good ball. 

However, no matter how well 
the Tritons play, it is still heart-
breaking if they do not finish on 
top after nine innings. Furthermore, 
anytime a team plays a NCAA 
Division III National runner-up and 
almost win~ , the taste left in the 
play..:r ' mouths is beyond bitter. 

No one likes to lose. 
Sunday's game was great base-

ball, but with an unfortunate result 
for the Tritons: Montdair State 
(N.J.) slid past UCSD 1-0, in a clas-
sic pitching duel between Montclair 
Stale right-hander Gregory Belson 
and Triton lefty John Gherini . 

Gherini entered Sunday's 
matchup with a 3. 14 ERA and a 3-
2 record. He also led the team III 
innings pitched with 28.2, and 
remains the leader of that category 
even after Sunday's mighty battle. 

Gherini fought all nine innings 
for a complete game, but UCSD 
couldn't generate enough run sup-
port despite its pitcher's outstanding 
eftort on the mound. Gherini gave 
up 6 hits to Montclair State, but 
Belson 's stilling of the Tritons' 
offense was superior - right lielder 
Eric Schramm was the only Triton 
to hit successfully against him. 

The Red Hawks scored their 
only run in the top of the fourth 

First Seder 

ByJohn...,..... 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD golf team runs on a 
budget one-fifth the size of most 
Division JI schools. Nonetheless, 
the Triton Division III 
team has traditionally 
been as good, if not 
beller, than its D-II 
opponents. 

March 5 and 6 
marked the 49th Annual 
Southern California 
Inten;ollegiate Golf 
Championship held at Torrey 
Pines Golf Course just up the 
road, and the Tritons proved that 
they don' t need money to be com-
petitive. 

excited that his squad finished 
stronger than Division II schools 
such as UC Davis, Cal Stale San 
Bernardino and Cal State 
Bakersfield, in the tournament. 

"If you would have told 
me before the tourna· 

ment that we were 
going to beat UC 
Davis, I would have 
told you that you had 

lost your marbles," 
Wydra said. "Beating 

them was a feather in our I:aps." 
After the first day of competi-

tion, the Tritons found themselves 
12 strokes ahead of the next-best 
Emory University (Ga.) in the 
College Division, but 6 strokes 
off the pace of Stale's tournament 
leading 300. UCSD's top first-
round scores were recorded by 
Kevin Petrie and Ben Page, who 
each shot a 4-over-par 76. 

Usa Huff/GUlJldian 
Niner: John Gherini winds up against Montclair State (NJ). 

Overall, .the Tritons finished in 
second place in the 17 school 
field, just one stroke shy of the 
tournament's winner, San Diego 
State University. UCSD's team 
total of 606 earned them top hon-
ors in the College Division, how-
ever. San Diego State's 29-over-
par 605 was good for first place in 
the University Division and the 
overall win. 

Petrie was the top UCSD 
golfer, and was also the overall 
winner in the College Division. 
Petrie tume,d in a tournament total 
4-over-par 148, just 2 strokes ofT 
the pace. with 2 outs. 

The Tritons threatened their 
opponents' status in the eighth, 
however, when Brian Terrell walked 
and stole second with 2 outs. Josh 
Strobl reached lirst on an error by 
the shortstop advancing Terrell to 
third on the play. Todd Sherwin 
pinch ran for Strobl and moved over 
to second base on a wild pitch. With 
two Tritons in scoring position, 
Schramm struck out. 

"Gh~rini pitched a heck of a 
game," designated hiller Steve 
Pelletier said. "John [pitched) well , 
the defense played really well -
we just didn't get the key hits when 
we really needed them. As soon as 
things start coming together as a 
whole, we're gonna go on a roll." 

The Tritons will hopefully taste 
the sweetness of revenge when 
they face the Red Hawks again 
Monday at 2:30 p.m. 

Joining the Tritons' "A" team 
on the podium, was UCSD's "B" 
team, whose team-total 64-over-
par 640, earned them second 
place in the College Division. It 
was the first time in history that 
UCSD had an "A" and "B" team 
finish in first and second. 

Head Coach Mike Wydra was 
impressed with his team's overall 
performance, and even more 

From here, the Tritons will 
participate in the highly competi-
tive Aztec Invitational. The 
Invitational brings together 20 of 
the best golf squads in the coun-
try, most of them Division I 
scholars~ip schools. 

This, however, does not daunt 
the Tritons. 

"Success breeds success," 
Wydra said.

Thanks in part to an ace, the 
Tritons scored the !irst 5 points of 
the game. UCSD's intensity let up 
just slightly, allowing the Banana 
Slugs to make it a closer game. In 
the end, however, the Tritons were 
too tough and put the Banana Slugs

Crew Keeps Rowing 
DOWNSTREAM: Men's 8 wins by three seconds 
By John Maynard 
Sports Editor 

Although the Tritons easily 
rowed past the UC Irvine Anteaters 
two weekends ago, winning five 
out of six races, they were 
still a little hesitant 
about last 
weekend's 
races against 
Long Beach 
State University. The 
Tritons were unsure 
whether or not they were 
up to speed, and feared a fast-paced 
Long Beach State squad. 
Fortunately, the Tritons were able 
to lay all fears to rest after 
Saturday's races: They had a good 
showing. 

Overall, the team won three of 
their five races. The men 's varsity 
eight, the men's novice eight and 
the women's varsity four eal:h 
rel:orded victories. 

"We had another great race," 
men 's varsity eight rower Paul 
Dodge said. "We spent the whole 
week doing skills and drills and we 
increased our boat speed by 
becoming beller rowers." 

The men's varsity eight's week 
of technical training proved to be 
especially beneticial. Despite an 
uneven start - Long Beach State 
had a two-seat advantage at the gun 
- the Tritons persevered in the 
2,OOO-meter race, winning by 3 
seconds with a time of 6:30. 

"We started crankin' in on it at 
the I,OOO-meter mark and we were 
up by a boat length for most of the 

games are all must-wins." 
This match was a positive end 

to the slump that Hite had been 
stul:k in for the past few matches. 

"I was flaving a lot of ttouble 
with my swing," Hite said. "It felt 
good to get that behind me." 

The Tritons, now 3-13 for the 
season, are ranked No. 4 in 
Division III volleyball rankings. 

On Tuesday, the Tritons return 
to Mount Pacific Sports Federation 
playas they take on Loyola 
Marymount University in Los 
Angeles. On Friday, the Tritons 
return home to take on the 

race," Dodge said. 
The men's novice eight also 

beat both Long Beach novice eight 
squads by 3 and 32 seconds, 
respectively. 

The women's squad had a 
solid outing as well against 

Long Beadl 
State. The varsi-
ty four pieced 

together another sub-
stantial win on Saturday, 

breezing by Long Beach 's squad 
by 4 seconds in the opening race of 
the day. 

"It was an exciting race," Dodge 
said. "We were cheering them on. It 
was back and forth all race, but 
they held their own." 

Both the women 's novice eight 
and the men's varsity four put forth 
good efforts against Long Beach 
State. Unfortunately, they I:ame up 
short. The women's eight lost by a 
good margin, and the men's novice 
four was edged out of first place by 
just under 2 seconds. 

After Saturday's races, the 
Tritons will not compete until 
March 27 and March 28 when they 
will row in the annual San Diego 
Crew Classic - one of the biggest 
races on the West coast. 

"This week we're going to get 
our bUll kicked," Dodge said 
regarding the team 's anticipated 
training for the Crew Classic. 
"We're trying to stay above mainte-
nance level." 

UCSD is rowing very well this 
year, so chances arc that the Tritons 
will do just line come March 27.

wllh the UC Santa Cru l Banana 
Slug" the Tritons ' lo,ing streak 

came to a screeching halt as UCSO 
went on to win, 15-0, 15-5, 15-!!. 

Game one was possibly the 
Tritons' most dominating perfor-
manl:e in any single game this year. 

UCS D is notorious for start-
ing slowly, but it changed 

that notion on 
Friday.Big 
hlocks by sopho-

more outside hitter 
Zack Hite at 1-0 and 

seni or middle hlocker Bill 
Si nclair at 9-0 were crowd-
plea,ers. but the Tritons gained 
mo,t of their momentum from their 
digging and attacking. 

The Tritons were hilling with 
thc efficiency of a Pentium 1\1 
proce"or. totaling 15 kills in the 
game while committing only 2 
error,. The Banana Slugs had no 
answer for UCSO's attack, and 

they also couldn't seem to put any-
thing away. Plagued by hitting 
errors. the Banana Slugs commit-
ted 10 such offenses in the first 
game. The Tritons, however. 
helped their cause by committing 
only 2 service errors in the first 
game_ 

There was little difference 
hetween the Tritons' play in game 
one and their play in game two. 
The 5 points allowed to the Banana 
Slugs were more a testament to bet-
ter play by Santa Cruz than an indi-
cation of decreasing intensity for 
the Tritons. 

As in game one, the Tritons got 
off to a quick start. opening up a 7-
I lead. keyed by a block by Hite 
and Sinclair at 4-1. After giving up

The Most Wonderful 
Time of the Year 

If you ask a random sampling 
of people what their favorite 
time of year is. most will say 
December hccausc of the holi -
day~ or June because of the 
heglnning of ~ummer. Well. I 
may be in the minority. hut early 
to mid-March is har none my 
favorite time of the year. Winter 
is beginning to give way to the 
warmth of spring. the days are 
gelling longer. baseball is in 
spring training and. of course. 
March Madness IS underway. 

The NCAA basketball tour-
nament is the pinnacle of sport-
ing events. and with the tourna-
ment pairings revealed ye~ter­
da). II has ofii cla ll y begun. You 
can guara ntee that Xerox 
macillnes were busy thb, morn-
Ing. running ofI coplcs for office 
poob around the country. 

II you arc unfamili,lr with the 
NCAA college tournament. you 
an: missing out. The tournarnent 
consists of 64 teams playmg in 
,ingle-elimination warfare that 
Jlway\ pnxJU(;cs lIlany shocking 
upsets and thrilling finishes . 

The first round of games gets 
underway on Thursday and 
Friday. These arc po,sihly the 
best two sporb days of the year 
hecause there arc exciting 
games televised non-stop all 
day long. These two days usual-
ly produce many of the most 
Intnd-hoggllllg upsets. 

Here is a preview of what you 
should expect : Don't pick a No. 
I or o. 2 seed to Ime. Sinl:e thc 
expansion of the tournament to 
64 teams. a o. 16 seed has 
never beaten a No. I and only 
two No. 2 seeds have ever lost. 

With those exceptions. any-
thing is possible. You will sec 
upsets and the three seeds arc 
certainly vulnerable. One 
mighty three ,eed falls in the 
first round almost every year. 

There are many games that 
look like definite upset possibili-
ties. such as Kent over Temple. 
or Siena owr Arkansas. But the 
thing that makes this tournament 
,0 great is that nobody can pre-
dict what will happen . Last year. 
I picked Utah to lose in the lirst 
round. and they went to the 
championship game. That ,hould

After a two-week layoff due to a barrage of postponed games, the Tritons 
returned in stride with three wins last week, imprOVing to 6-6 

By Kev[n Byrne

The Tritons bounced back from 
a two-week layoff so strongly that 
it seems as if they never even took 
a break. After the hiatus, the 
Tritons were fired up for a 
pair of doubleheaders 
last week and came 

lighted by Harlan's two-run single 
down the right tield line, giving the 
team a 4-0 lead that wasn't cut into 
until the seventh inning. The linal 
score was 4-1. 

The Tritons broke away in 
the second game, using 

offensive power to win 
9-3. APU was forced 

away with a trio of ..... ALL to watch the Tritons 
wins. 

On Saturday. the 
Tritons played Azusa 
Pacific University (APU) 

score in the third, 
fourth and fi fth 

innings. putting a total of 
6 runs on the board. The 

and beat them in both games. 4-1 Triton, added another 3 runs in the 
and 9-3. Earlier this week, the 
Tritons also faced Point Lorna 

Na.(Uren~ UniverSity and split two 
games with the Crusaders. 7-2 and 
4-5 . 

'They were ready," Head Coach 
Patt i Gerckens said. "They were 
dying to play." 

The mo:.l recent doubleheader 
took place on March 6 at Triton 
Field. and was honored as Parents' 
Day. The girls didn ' t let their par-
ents down. slaughtering APU in 
both games. 

The scoring got otT to a quick 
start for the Tritons in the tirst 
game - freshman Leea Harlan sin-
gled to center tield to bring in 
freshman Kristina Anderson. who 
hit a double earlier in the inning. 

The game was a defensive 
stand. with neither tcam scoring 
through the next three-and-a-half 
innings. Pitcher Harlan held t\PU 
to only I run and scattered 7 hits , 
pitchi ng a complete game. 

The fifth inning was very pro-
ductive for the Tritons. as they put 
the game out of reach for APU. 
This three-run inning was high-

sixth inning. 
Junior Cynthia Sam crossed 

home plate three times. going 3 for 
4 on the day. Junior Caroline 
Engler went 2 for 3 and scored 
once to lead the Tritons in offense. 
. The Tritons were in romplete 

control of both games. 
"It was a great day," Gcrckens 

said. "I really thought we staned to 
hit and we ' re getting confidence. 
We re-eva luated why we're playing 
the game. Now we're in a good 
position." 

The Tritons were in good posi-
tion to beat Ihe Crusaders earlier 
last week as well. They took the 
tirst game of Wednesday 's double 
header. hut were edged out by Point 
Loma in the second game. 

The first game went well for the 
Tritons. who dominated Ihrough 
much-needed olTen~ivc surges. The 
Trit~ns racked up 4 runs in the tirst 
inning, highlighted by Anderson 's 
two-run triple. The offense contin-
ued to roll for UCSD as the Tritons 
brought home 3 more runs over the 
course of the game.

[n Ihe second game, Ihe Tritons 
did not fare as well - last inning 
efforts came up shon and the game 
was lost by I run, 4-5. 

Next Wednesday, the Tritons 
will take on Norwich University 
and Trinity University, as the teams 
will be visiting Southern California 

uncertain about the teams the 
Tritons will face. 

"I have no idea about either 
team," Gerekens said. "I'm sure 
Norwich is having their first week 
outside, so we'lI take it to our 
advantage. Trinity is not known to 
be a powerhouse, but we'll prepare 
for them." 

The Drought is Over for UCSD ~)Il-b~ '. -~(tUnLrt~~~ii-QUENCHED: The Tritons snapped a seven game losing streak on Friday 
By Bill Burger

You are in a desert , crawling on 
your hands and knees. dehydrated 
and desperatelysearching for 
,ome form of moisture. Just 
as you arc about to gi ve 
lip in despair, 
yOU see an oasis 
in the distance 
with palm trees. a 
pool and a full bar. You get 
up and run toward this apparent 
paradise, knowing that it is your 
saving grace. The men 's volleyball 

. tcam knows this feeling. 
The Tritons were in the midst of 

a seven-match dry ,pell when they 
took the coun last Friday night, 
having lost all matche, since Jan. 
29. After Friday night's matchup 
with the UC Santa Cruz Banana 
Slugs, the Tritons' losing streak 

came to a screechi ng halt as UCSD 
went on to win, 15-0, 15-5, 15-!1. 

Game one was possibly the 
Tritons' most dominating perfor-
mance in any single game this year. 

UCSD is notorious for start-
ing slowly, but it changed 

that notion on 
Friday . Big 
blocks by sopho-

more outside hitter 
Zack Hite at 1-0 and 

senior middle blocker Bill 
Sinclair at 9-0 were crowd-
pleasers. but the Tritons gained 
most of their momentum from their 
digging and attacking. 

The Tritons were hitting with 
the efficiency of a Pentium 111 
processor. totaling 15 kills in the 
game while committing only 2 
errors. The Banana Slugs had no 
answer for UCSD's attack. and 

they also couldn't seem to put any-
thing away. Plagued by hilling 
errors, the Banana Slugs commit-
ted 10 such offenses in Ihe first 
game. The Tritons, however, 
helped their cause by committing 
only 2 service errors in the first 
game. 

There was little difference 
between the Tritons' play in game 
one and their play in game two. 
The 5 points allowed to the Banana 
Slugs were more a testament to bet-
ter play by Santa Cruz than an indi-
cation of decreasing intensity for 
the Tritons. 

As in game one. the Tritons got 
off to a quick stan, opening up a 7-
I lead, keyed by a block by Hite 
and Sinclair at 4-1 . After giving up 
I point, the Tritons then reeled off 
another streak of 6 points to take
