The State Historical Resources 
Commission unanimously decided on 
Nov. 9 to nominate University House 
for a position on the National Register 
of Historic Places. The 6-0 vote could 
make it much more difficult for UCSD 
to move forward with its plans to 
demolish the La Jolla Farms mansion.

Deemed uninhabitable in 2004 due 
to extensive mold and poor structural 
integrity, the university has since been 
looking for a way to rebuild on the 

property. 
UCSD Deputy Director of 

University Communications Dolores 
Davies said that the house holds a 
historical importance to the campus, 
as almost every chancellor has resided 
on the property since the university 
purchased it in 1967. The house has 
also served as a functional setting for 
assemblies and other past events hosted 
by the university.

Opposition to the project has come 
from a number of eclectic sources, 
including historians and American 
Indian groups that have a vested inter-
est in the property’s archeological and 
historical value. Despite suggestions 
that the house be built on a different 
site to reduce public protest, the uni-
versity decided that it was not a feasible 
option. 

“There have been people associated 
with the university that feel it would 

be a mistake for them to dispose of the 
property,” Davies said.

Among the groups opposing the 
house’s demolition is the La Jolla 
Historical Society, which until late last 
year was still negotiating with the uni-
versity to keep the house intact. Don 
Schmidt, a La Jolla resident and board 
member of the society, said that dwin-
dling progress on the matter led LJHS 
to create a committee to apply for the 
national registry. 

Built by historical architect William 
Lumpkins in 1952 in a style called 
“Pueblo revival,” historians view the 
property’s unique architecture as an 
important resource to the community 
and country. The house also sits atop an 
ancient American Indian burial ground 
— a pivotal concern of American Indian 
groups — that was found to contain

The Graduate and Professional 
Student Experience and Satisfaction 
Committee recently released a 
report containing recommenda-
tions meant to transform the cam-
pus environment and improve both 
graduate and undergraduate life.

The committee, formed at 
the request of Dean of Graduate 
Studies Richard Attiyeh and former 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Joseph W. Watson in spring 2006, 
spent the last year collecting student 
input through thousands of public 
interviews, as well as surveys like 
the Graduate Student Association’s 
Graduate and Professional Student 
Experience Survey, which was con-
ducted in 2005.

Graduate Student co-Chair 
Derek Lomas encouraged students 
to take advantage of the administra-
tion’s request for suggestions as to 

how the university could improve.
“For students who are interested 

in change in general, this is the kind 
of thing that you can get behind,” 
he said. “The more the changes are 
supported by students, the more 
likely they are to happen.”

The report outlines five major 
areas in which it claims improve-
ment is needed for graduate 
students: sense of community, aca-
demic life, housing, student sup-
port services and communications. 
It also recommends the formation 
of a permanent GPSES Steering 
Committee and creation of an assis-
tant dean of graduate student life 
position.

However, Lomas stressed that a 
sense of campus community, which 
he considers to be the report’s prin-
cipal topic, is not something that is 
specific to one group of students.

The report’s proposals include 
everything from the creation of 
ethnic food carts to landscaping 

the area around Geisel Library to 
allow for recreational space, ideas 
he said would benefit the campus 
as a whole.

“Changes that improve commu-
nity for graduate students will also 
improve community for undergrad-
uate students,” he said.

Lomas said that in contrast to the 
Undergraduate Student Experience 
and Satisfaction Committee report 
of 2005, which received criticism for 
being too long-winded and broad, 
Assistant Dean of Graduate Studies 
Tim Johnston praised the GPSES 
committee for limiting and consoli-
dating the issues that it addressed.

“The intent was to focus atten-
tion on major issues and give the 
steering committee a direction and 
goals rather than specific action 
items,” Johnston said.

He added that the report will 
allow the permanent steering com-
mittee to base its actions on current 
situations rather than previously 

mandated instructions.
However, Lomas emphasized 

that the report only contains rec-
ommendations.

“We didn’t release policy,” he 
said. “We provided a vision of grad-
uate student life for five years down 
the road.”

In one survey, just 10 percent of 
graduate students reported feeling a 
sense of community, a figure Lomas

Grad Report Highlights Community-Building Techniques

The University of California is 
seeking a formal review of a $3-
million fine assessed after a former 
employee of the UC-managed Los 
Alamos National Laboratory was 
discovered with stolen classified 
data.

The university was fined after 
authorities linked 1,219 pages of 
documents and classified computer 
data devices to then 22-year-old 
former laboratory archivist Jessica 
Quintana, who lived in a trailer that 
New Mexico police raided for drugs 
in October 2006.

UC officials said that they are 
requesting the legal review because 
of the limited time they have to 
discuss the issue with the U.S. 
Department of Energy’s National 
Nuclear Security Administration.

“The final notice of violation 
called for UC to respond within 30 
days,” UC Office of the President 
spokesman Chris Harrington said. 
“[The Judicial Review] preserves the 
university’s right to continue ongo-
ing discussions with the department 
regarding the notice of violation.” 

The university objected to the 
alleged violations, claiming that 
Quintana was not employed by 
either the university or the labora-
tory when she was found with the 
classified material. After working 
at LANL for three years, Quintana’s 
work contract had expired a few 
weeks before the raid. She worked 
in three divisions at the laboratory, 
including Safeguards and Security, 
a physics division and the top-secret 
X-Division.

University officials also argued 
that they had taken preventative 
steps while managing the labora-
tory, such as reducing the number 
of removable drives and other forms 
of portable media. 

Despite these claims, the NNSA 
found that the university showed “a 
fundamental and disturbing misun-
derstanding of the proper approach 
to security matters.” 

A D.O.E. notice said that the 
university failed to manage its clas-
sified data, having not implemented 
suitable measures such as physical 
checks or escort oversight to pre-
vent unauthorized removal of clas-
sified materials from the “vault-type 
room” where such information is 
stored. 

The final notice of violation 
from the NNSA also outlined five 
infractions relating to the security 
of classified materials, alleging the 
“negligence” of classified material 
protection requirements which led 
to the breach by an individual sub-
contractor.

Notorious rabble-rouser 
suddenly departs, with 
no explanation, more 
than a year before his 
term was to expire.
By Matthew L’Heureux
News Editor

After an eight-year tenure fraught 
with controversy, outspoken UC 
Regent John J. Moores unexpectedly 
resigned from his position on Nov. 12.

Moores did not provide any reason 
for his departure, nor did he give the 
UC Board of Regents advance notice 
of his plans to leave, UC Office of the 
President spokesman Trey Davis said.

Appointed in 1999 by former Gov. 
Gray Davis, Moores resigned more 
than a year before his 10-year term 
would have come to an end.

Moores’ relationship with fellow 
regents was historically rocky, dating 
back to a 2003 report where he lam-
basted the university for allegedly cir-
cumventing Proposition 209, which 
bans California public schools from 
using race and ethnicity in admis-
sions decisions. He went on to lead 
an unsuccessful fight to ban research 
funded by tobacco companies at the 
university last year, which the regents 
rejected 14-4 on Sept. 20.

POORLY DRAWN LINES  BY REZA FARAZMAND

New UC Merced 
Chancellor Inaugurated

Sung-Mo “Steve” Kang was 
inducted as the chancellor of UC 
Merced in a Nov. 6 ceremony on the 
university’s campus.  

Kang was joined by UC President 
Robert C. Dynes and Vice Chairman 
of the UC Board of Regents Russell 
S. Gould, as well as other UC and 
government officials.  

More than 600 people, including 
UC Merced faculty, staff, students 
and invited friends of the campus, 
witnessed the inauguration and key-
note speaker Arno Penzias, who 
received the 1978 Nobel Prize in 
physics.

“UC Merced is just stepping into 
its new phase, which, as an engineer, 
I would call, ‘UC Merced 2.0,’” Kang 
said to the audience. “We have come 
a long way in the short time since 
our campus opened.  Our well-loved 
campus is thriving and poised for 
great achievements.”

In his speech, Kang said he would 
strive to innovate every aspect of the 
campus’ endeavors, including aca-
demic excellence, international part-
nerships, community service pro-
grams, entrepreneurship, technology 
for distance learning and medicine.

“Kang will lead UC Merced into a 
new era of ascendancy and distinc-
tion,” Dynes said during the cer-
emony. “And it will be my privilege 
and my joy to watch him do it. His 
passion for innovation will help real-
ize the founders’ vision of transform-
ing the valley.”

Kang is the first Korean-American 
to lead a major research university. 
More than 60 percent of UC Merced 

students come from underrepresent-
ed ethnic or socioeconomic groups. 
In addition, more than half of the 
university’s students are first-genera-
tion college students. 

Study Suggests Curvy 
Women Are Smarter

Results from a new UC-led study 
reveal that larger hips correlate with 
higher test scores for both a woman 
and her child.  

Researchers from the University 
of Pittsburgh and UC Santa Barbara 
analyzed data from a study in which 
body measurements, education lev-
els and various cognitive test scores 
of more than 16,000 women and girls 
were recorded from 1988-94. 

The report shows that women 
with waists that were about 70 per-
cent of the diameter of their hips 
scored slightly better on intelligence 
tests and tended to have a high-
er level of education than women 
with a higher waist-to-hip ratio. The 
researchers also contend that men, 
whether they know it or not, tend to 
prefer curvier women because of this 
advantage.

Although the differences in cogni-
tive ability were small — on average 
between 3.6 percent and 7 percent 
— the reason behind the findings 
may lie in the differences between 
the fat stored in the hips and legs 
and fat stored in the stomach. The 
fat surrounding fuller hips and thighs, 
researchers said, holds higher levels 
of omega-3 fatty acids, which foster 
brain growth. 

The study was published in the 
journal of Evolution and Human 
Behavior.

battle, told the San Diego Union-
Tribune that his friend had been frus-
trated with delayed efforts to restruc-
ture the university’s much-criticized 
operations.

“If he felt it was a productive use of 
time, he would still be there,” Connerly 
said.

Earlier this week, UC President 
Robert C. Dynes issued a brief state-
ment that praised Moores for his 
various accomplishments and ser-
vice to the university. Specifically, 
Dynes mentioned Moores’ role in 
developing StatFinder, an online 
tool released in October that pro-
vides detailed information about UC 
admission statistics.

“John Moores has been a generous 
philanthropist both at the university 
and beyond, he has been actively 
engaged on issues of interest to him 
at the Board of Regents and he has 
worked to improve public access to 
data regarding student admissions at 
the university,” Dynes said.

Apart from his career as a regent, 
Moores is the owner of the San Diego 
Padres, as well as the chairman of 
investment firm JMI Services, Inc. and 
the Carter Center, a nonprofit orga-
nization dedicated to the preserva-
tion of human rights. UCSD’s Rebecca 
and John Moores Cancer Center was 
renamed in his honor after he and his 
wife donated $20 million in 2001.

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger will 
nominate a successor to complete the 
remainder of Moores’ term, which 
will expire in March 2009. A date for 
the appointment has not yet been 
announced.

Price Center’s future Loft night-club took center stage at yester-day’s council meeting during a 
presentation that emphasized its wine 
bar and sociable setting. Next up was 
a presentation regarding the pending 
overhaul of UCSD’s Web site, mak-
ing it a great night for anyone who 
knew his Cabernet Sauvignon from his 
XHTML.

However, before these matters 
could be tended 
to, several council-
members needed 
to work their way 
into the build-
ing. A scheduling 
conflict forced 
the council to 
conduct its busi-
ness outside of its usual Price Center 
Ballroom location. 

The imposing locked doors of the 
Mandell Weiss Forum sent some coun-
cilmembers snaking down an entry 
ramp, in through a backstage exit, up 
a cramped flight of stairs, and, remark-
ably, out an upstairs exit that left them 
right where they started.

Biological Sciences Senator Emma 
Sandoe started the meeting after an 
11-minute delay.

“Hopefully we all learned some-
thing about campus today,” she said.

Director of University Events Office 
Martin Wollesen then launched into 
his promotion of the Loft, an on-cam-
pus nightclub that’s scheduled to open 
by late March or early April.

Wollesen explained that the Loft 
was founded on three pillars: event 
programming several nights a week, 
food and beverage service and a unique 
interior design.

He added that his office was consid-
ering daytime alcohol service to attract 
more students as well as a “Loft lift” 
to help transport off-campus students 

home safely.
Following Wollesen was TritonLink 

Project Director Beth Surrell, who 
demonstrated a closed beta version of 
the new UCSD Web site. She said the 
update will affect both TritonLink and 
the campus site, the latter of which 
hasn’t been redesigned since 2001.

The new Web site will have a more 
consistent, streamlined appearance. 
Similar to the current site, the new 

one will make 
use of updates 
from University 
Communications 
for its front-page 
content, now com-
plete with a rotating 
lead news photo.
Councilmembers 

had some reservations about the rede-
sign.

Associate Vice President of Student 
Advocacy Neetu Balram noted the 
marginalization of the color yellow in 
TritonLink’s new look.

“It doesn’t look as happy,” she said.
In expressing his skepticism, 

Associate Vice President of Academic 
Affairs Long Pham said, “It looks like 
WebCT. Maybe that’s why I’m not get-
ting the … ” and awkwardly rolled his 
hands over each other toward Surrell in 
lieu of completing the criticism.

The new Web site will launch on 
Dec. 17.

After Surrell’s presentation, 
Associate Vice President of Local 
Affairs Aida Kuzucan followed up last 
week’s discussion of a “fabulous parade” 
for UCSD by telling the council she had 
secured a float in La Jolla’s upcoming 
holiday parade.

“It’s not actually a float,” she said, 
to rising laughter and cheers, “but an 
imaginative one in my head that needs 
to be built in two weeks and I need 
help. I’ve never made a float before.”

needs rehabilitation, they said it is 
not falling apart. Additionally, he 
added that the house can be refur-
bished for less money and should be 
kept as a “moment in time” for both 
La Jolla residents and future UCSD 
students.

“This is the kind of historic struc-
ture that preservationists want to 
keep intact, not just elements of it 
taken off the site,” Coyle said.

The university has proposed sev-
eral alternatives to combat the loss, 
including using the house’s frame as 
garden walls or providing a detailed 
video history of the site.

S c h m i d t , 
along with other 
historians and 
preservationists, 
said that these 
are unsatisfactory 
means of uphold-
ing the property’s 
archeological and 
historical value. 

“Why, when 
you know you 
have a historical 
resource, would 
you create a little 
historic petting 

zoo?” he said. “I mean, would we tear 
down the Eiffel Tower and leave a few 
scraps of metal as remnants?”

Davies said the university has yet 
to review the designation in order to 
best address the issues it presents. 
A final proposal was meant to be 
submitted in September, but now the 
historical designation must be taken 
into account before submitting the 
project for approval. 

The SHRC is expected to make 
a final decision on the nomination 
within 60 to 90 days.

skeletal remains dating back to roughly 
9650 B.C. In addition to disrupting the 
ancient resting place, reconstructing a 
new house raised environmental con-
cerns over plant and wildlife situated 
on the property. 

Although the national-registry 
designation does not prevent the 
university from moving ahead with 
its plans, Courtney Coyle, an envi-
ronmental attorney who helped one 
of the Indian tribal nations submit 
the application to the SHRC, said 
that raising awareness across dif-
ferent communities about the prop-
erty’s significance 
would be the 
effort’s primary 
benefit.

“The designa-
tion would elevate 
the status of the 
property and 
become more of 
a pubic relations 
issue that they 
have to deal with,” 
Coyle said.

Stagnated con-
struction would 
give way to addi-
tional scrutiny of what is being done 
and how, Coyle said. University offi-
cials would have to show that they 
have done their best to preserve the 
site’s integrity and could find no way 
to preserve the house, she added.

An environmental impact report 
released in June detailed several dif-
ferent options for refurbishing or 
demolishing the house on the prop-
erty. The university cited the less-
ened costs of demolition as evidence 
against renovating the mansion.

Schmidt said he disagrees with 
the finding, and said LJHS has since 
hired consultants to survey the prop-
erty. While they found the house 

“[The UC system] may not escape 
liability for these deficiencies because 
an individual subcontractor exploited 
weaknesses in [the university’s] secu-
rity management controls shortly 
after the university’s tenure ended,” 
the notice said.

The university managed the labora-
tory from 1943 to May 2006, just five 
months before the breach. 

Los Alamos National Security 
LLC — an entity of which the univer-
sity is a member — currently over-

sees the labs, and has already paid 
a $300,000 fine for seven security-
related violations. Though the uni-
versity had fewer violations in total, 
it was fined more heavily because the 
D.O.E. found fault in the university’s 
inadequate management, according 
to the letter.

Quintana said she had taken the 
material home to catch up on work 
and later forgot about it. She has 
since pleaded guilty to a single misde-
meanor count of negligent handling 
of classified documents. 

LANL representatives could not 
be reached for comment.

Despite the university’s decision 
to seek a formal legal review, it is 
uncertain if the university will ulti-
mately decide to appeal the deci-
sion.

Harrington said that the uni-
versity wants to communicate fur-
ther with the D.O.E. on the issue, 
which the legal review permits.

said should upset all students and 
inspire them to voice their concerns.

“We need to pay attention to the 
things that don’t get measured by 
academic performance,” he said. “We 
are really trying to change the think-
ing in the administration.”

The report argues that a high aca-
demic standard is not the sole deter-
minant that makes a great university.

“The ‘mastery’ of an academic 
discipline is not the solitary goal of 
the graduate education,” the report 

said. “‘Connectivity’ is also a primary 
value that must be consciously cul-
tivated.”

Johnston said that he is confident 
that the report will be successful in 
influencing future university deci-
sions.

“I think they did a great job at 
putting the report together and col-
lecting information, and I am looking 
forward to seeing some of their goals 
implemented,” he said.

Johnston said that Attiyeh and 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 

Penny Rue are scheduled to appoint 
members to the GPSES Steering 
Committee by the end of Fall 
Quarter.

He added that on-campus depart-
ments, student groups and service 
units have already begun to consider 
several of the recommendations of 
the report.

A proposed alteration to the UC admissions process, via a policy that would provide 
admissions consideration to appli-
cants who have not met all required 
“a-g” courses, among other changes, 
is simply another naive attempt by 
the university to boost the admis-
sion rates of underrepresented 
applicants. 

In actuality, the changes outlined 
by the UC Board of Admissions and 
Relations with Schools will do little 
to improve access to the nation’s 
premier public university system.

The policy, known as “entitled to 
review,” would scrap the university’s 
Eligibility Index, which is aimed at 
the state’s top 12.5 percent of high 
school graduates. Using a combi-
nation of factors such as GPA and 
standardized test scores, the index 
currently sets a minimum thresh-
old for those students’ admission 
eligibility. 

It also eliminates SAT II Subject 
Tests, which B.O.A.R.S. members 
say contribute “very little to [the 
university’s] ability to predict which 
applicants will perform well ini-
tially” at a UC campus.

However, the new policy’s most 
troubling aspect is its plan to cod-
dle certain applicants who do not 
complete all required “a-g” classes, 
but who demonstrate “substantially 
equivalent academic preparation.” 
These applicants would be grant-
ed a campus-based comprehensive 
review through which they could be 

offered admission. 
B.O.A.R.S. claims that the cur-

rent admissions guidelines favor 
“affluent” high schools made up 
of “large proportions of white and 
Asian students,” and that the new 
policy will better reflect the state’s 
other high schools. 

But skirting the “a-g” require-
ments does nothing to address the 
social factors contributing to low 
application rates among minority 
students. The university also fails to 
clarify what “equivalent academic 
preparation” means, leaving admis-
sions officials armed with a vague 
policy that could easily be subject 
to abuse.

The minimum requirements 
were put in place to ensure appli-
cants can succeed at the univer-
sity level, and most admitted stu-
dents complete well beyond the 
30 semesters currently required for 
admission, in addition to numerous 
community and personal achieve-
ments. 

Upon enrolling, students missing 
a year or more of English, math or 
laboratory science would inevita-
bly find themselves disadvantaged 
when compared to other students 
who have completed those classes, 
whether they were student body 
president or not.

If enacted, the policy will also 
undoubtedly lead to an increase in 
the number of applications to each 
UC campus, thus increasing competi-
tion among all students regardless of 

their level of academic preparation.
According to B.O.A.R.S., stu-

dents accepted under the new pol-
icy will be offered admission on a 
“by-exception basis entirely consis-
tent with the existing Admission by 
Exception policy.” 

If this is the case, then high-
achieving students missing one or 
two required courses already have 
an available option. So changing the 
entire admissions policy is, in effect, 
pointless. 

Although some ideas detailed in 
the proposal, such as the elimina-
tion of the SAT II Subject Tests, 
are worth exploring further, encour-
aging students who do not meet 
minimum requirements to apply is 
ultimately a disservice to qualified 
students who do.

A few nights ago I was hanging out with friends when we decided to grab some food. 
The excursion started like any other 
— fighting over who should drive, 
a few U-turns and some loud music 
— but when we finally arrived at 
Carl’s Jr., I made a shocking dis-
covery. 

Beside the normal human-

attended register were two auto-
matic-teller-looking machines that 
took food orders. 

I don’t know why I found this so 
outrageous; I should have seen it com-
ing. But for some reason this fast-food 
order apparatus took me by surprise. I 
mean, really people? Really?

Similar mechanical helpers 
already exist at banks and grocery 
stores, but I guess I just ignore them 
in favor of human help. You can 
already order pizza or buy movie 
tickets online, not ever having to 
deal with an actual person, and 
hardly anyone goes into the post 
office anymore. 

We all walk around, plugged into 
iconic white ear buds, not interacting 
with one another. And have you ever 
needed help with a bill payment, traf-
fic ticket or computer problem? 

Good luck navigating the 40-
minute phone tree. 

With all these simple interac-
tions already mechanized, it’s plau-
sible to believe that the majority of 
our everyday exchanges will soon 
be automated.

Wow, the future really is here. 
And man, did it sneak up on me. 

Now this might sound ridiculous 
coming from a 20-year-old, but what 
happened to the good old days when 
you could go to Carl’s Jr., order a 
chocolate milkshake, hand money 
to your little brother’s pimply high-
school friend and have that drink 
bused to your table?

Where will high-school kids 
get work experience if these tasks 
are now being taken care of by 
machines? 

If your first job wasn’t at a fast-food 
restaurant, it was probably something 
similarly blue collar — maybe you 
took movie tickets, washed dishes or, 
if you were lucky, filed papers at an

STATE NEWS — In another mis-
guided attempt to reform California’s 
faltering education system, Gov.
Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a bill 
last month that will expand the fac-
tors used to calculate a high school’s 
Academic Performance Index, start-

ing in 2011.
Currently, the state bases a 

school’s API score on the perfor-
mance of enrolled students on the 
Standardized Testing and Reporting 
and California High School Exit 
Examination tests. These scores are 
then used to determine funding eli-
gibiity and school rankings. 

The new law would extend the 
scores to include underperforming 
students who were sent by their 
school to an alternative education 
program, thus lowering the API 
score. Additionally, it would take 
into account the dropout rates for 
eighth and ninth grade students. 

 According to a recent article in 
the San Francisco Chronicle, nearly 

300,000 of the state’s high school 
students, or 15 percent, attend such 
alternative  programs. Despite  the 
high number of students omitted 
from the score, the new law would 
have little impact. 

Although including these param-
eters in schools’ API scores would 
more accurately reflect perfor-
mance, it would do little to actually 
improve that performance because 
it fails to attack the issues causing 
poor performance. 

And rather than remedy an 
education system in dire need of 
improvement, it would penalize 
high achievers at low-performing 
schools by saddling them with the 
reduced funding resulting from a 

low API score.
Reducing the dropout rate is 

one of those lofty, feel-good goals 
with which everyone should agree. 
However, lawmakers rarely propose 
appropriate solutions to address the 
problem. The law points out, cor-
rectly and poignantly, that many 
California students fail to graduate  
high school, and that those students 
will likely spend their adult lives 
disadvantaged and reliant on state 
welfare.

By calling for only a change to 
the state’s performance indicator 
of schools, the law fails to remedy 
California’s education woes. Simply 
including underperforming students 
in an API score will not change their 

performance or prevent them from 
dropping out. 

One conspiracy theory put forth 
by the Chronicle, relying on sup-
posed circumstantial evidence, 
suggested that schools are secretly 
pushing lower-performing students 
out of their district to boost API 
scores. 

Rather than placing the blame 
on a shadowy cabal of corrupt edu-
cators who want their school to be 
ranked higher at all costs, exam-
ining statistics would be useful. 
According to the National Dropout 
Prevention Center/Network, over 
half of eighth- to tenth-grade stu-

Mini Time Tiff Could Mean Bearish Problems for Rue

EDITORIALS

In relationships, it’s the smaller interactions that best signify the bigger picture. Expect a broken 
rapport, then, between new Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Penny 
Rue and A.S. councilmembers. The 
wildly popular council-sponsored 
Bear Garden has undergone a series 
of time-swaps; those changes, made at 
Rue’s behest, could sour students’ taste 
with an administrator that said she is 
committed to personal interaction.

The implementation of Bear 
Gardens has been perhaps the A.S. 
Council’s most notable achievement 
over the past year. Each time the 
council’s programming department 
hosts the multi-quarterly event, it 
achieves the intangibly dreamy goals 
laid out by the Undergraduate Student 
Experience and Satisfaction Report: 
to build, strengthen and reinforce 
community ideals. Those were paral-
lel to Rue’s goals when she began her 
tenure earlier this year. 

In an interview with the Guardian, 
Rue acknowledged UCSD’s lack of 
cooperative spirit and the pains created 
by its decentralized structure  — then 

she said she could fix it. Rue’s solution 
was to interact directly with students; 
to actively seek out and hear the stu-
dent voice; to minimize bureaucratic 
fluff. The efforts were far from revolu-
tionary, but admirable in scope.

The recent snag between council-
members and Rue speak against her 
early-year ambitions. Fearing that 
alcohol consumption would clash 
with the university’s academic mis-
sion, Rue ordered this year’s first 
Bear Garden to be moved to a later 
time. 

The same rule-of-thumb, used 
against the Nov. 30 Bear Garden, 
inflamed councilmembers, who said 
that wintertime brought darkness 
earlier in the day. The extra costs to 
support the needed lighting for night-
time, councilmembers said, would 
force them to cancel the event. 

After a meeting with Rue, which 
produced no gainful results, coun-
cilmembers lamented her attitude 
toward their coveted event. Then, 
after a meeting with Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of Student Life Gary R. 
Ratcliff, Rue acquiesced to beginning 

the Nov. 30 Bear Garden at 2 p.m. It’s 
alarming that the same arguments 
supporting the Bear Garden — its 
service to the U.S.E.S. report and 
community-building principles — 
worked to two opposite ends. Ratcliff 
should not be the deciding voice in 
an issue concerned mostly with stu-
dents, and Rue should respect A.S. 
councilmembers as the embodiment 

of student interests.
Rue came into this year stress-

ing principles of shared governance 
and fully open communication. But 
she isolates councilmembers, and will 
continue to do so when she invites 
bureaucracy to solve student prob-
lems. It is exactly what UCSD had 
hoped not to see again in the leader of 
its largest student-related sector.

Nuclear Weapons a 
Necessary War Deterrent

Dear Editor,
This letter is responding to the 

letter by Isaiah Sage that said the use 
of nuclear weapons cannot ever be 
justified and also that having them is 
tantamount to terrorism. He is erro-
neous on both counts.

First of all, any country with viable 
nuclear weapons makes itself unde-
featable through “mutually assured 
destruction,” a term which means 
that any attack would be responded 
in kind, ensuring the destruction of 
both countries. Furthermore, any 
nation with a nuclear arsenal is infi-
nitely more powerful than any other 
nation without an arsenal. The threat 
of a nuclear offensive is the best 
defense. If the U.S. were to com-
pletely disarm, it would leave itself 
open and could be conquered by any 
nation with an arsenal. Conventional 
armies mean nothing in the face of 
nuclear bombardment.

Is it unreasonable to assume 
Russia could have simply wiped out 
the United States if we had not had 
our nuclear arsenal?  The reason 
the Cold War is only known as such 
and not anything else is because of 
M.A.D. The threat of nuclear war 
not only kept both countries from 
experiencing a nuclear holocaust 
but also from fighting a conven-
tional war, because any conventional 
attack could have been immediately 
followed by a nuclear attack. Sage’s 
statement asserting that nuclear 
weapons were not needed to coun-
ter the Russian threat is completely 
absurd. 

However, nuclear weapons have 
only twice been used against civilian 
targets: in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 
These bombings are justified for one 
reason, which is that all war boils 
down to simple truths: kill or be 
killed, us or them, there is no in 

between. It is foolish to believe it is 
possible to “play” nice in war. When 
former President Harry S. Truman 
made the difficult decision to drop 
the bomb, hundreds of thousands, 
perhaps millions, of U.S. soldiers 
and civilians were saved who could 
have died in the resulting invasion. 
His duty was to U.S. citizens, and 
he chose his own people over the 
enemy, and that decision saved many 
American lives.

The difference between a nuclear 
arsenal and a terrorist attack is that a 
nuclear arsenal guarantees a nation’s 
continued sovereignty through 
M.A.D. A terrorist attack is meant 
to draw attention via the killing or 
the threat of killing government offi-
cials and/or civilians. Also, a nuclear 
strike has not happened in over fifty 
years thanks to M.A.D., while terror-
ism occurs every day. Obviously the 
two ideas cannot be equated because 
their nature and uses are inherently 
different. 

Supporting a continued nuclear 
arsenal does not mean that someone 
is a “nukemonger” or “warhawk.” It 
is meant to act as a defense, a deter-
rent. Nuclear weapons have forever 
altered the course of human history 
and are now an integral part of any 
country’s dealings with the interna-
tional community. To ignore that 
fact would not only be foolish but 
suicidal.

Activism Article Inflates 
Iraqi Civilian Death Toll

Dear Editor,
Before Jake Blanc gets on his 

soapbox and tells us the rousing 
tale of the “noble exploits of the tree 
sitters,” he should get some basic 
facts right first. Iraqbodycount.org, 
the premier anti-war Web site dedi-

cated to tracking civilian casual-
ties during the Iraq war, counts 
upward of 83,000 documented 
civilian deaths so far — a little 
less than the “hundreds of thou-
sands” Blanc claims have occurred. 
The war in Iraq has been tragic 
enough for Iraqis without Blanc 
needing to inflate the death toll.

Enterprise Not a Financial 
Burden for A.S. Council

Dear Editor,
I would like to address some 

points that were brought up in a 
recent article titled “Coddling a 
Prodigal Enterprise.”  The Challenge 
Course started as an enterprise less 
than four years ago. In this a short 
amount of time, it has been a well-
used facility appreciated by a vari-
ety of students. The agreement that 
was made stated: “The net proceeds, 
after payment of direct and indi-
rect operating expenses, will be split 
85 percent to Campus Recreation 
and 15 percent to the Associated 
Students.”

The fund subsidizing the cost 
for student groups to utilize the 
course was created in order to pro-
vide student organizations access to 
a leadership-development program 
on our own campus. Subsidizing 
student organizations’ use of the 
course will provide them with team-
building and leadership-develop-
ment programs that they may not 
have access to without the support 
of the council.  

This young enterprise has not 
been a financial burden for the 
Associated Students. Every year, the 
Challenge Course draws a variety of 
on-campus and off-campus organi-
zations. These organizations have 
left positive feedback, consistently 

commending the enterprise. The 
allocated funding for the Challenge 
Course is designated to benefit the 
student body. Subsidizing students’  
costs to use the course is not an 
attempt by the Associated Students 
to funnel more money to the enter-
prise. Instead, it is providing a valu-
able leadership opportunity for our 
student organizations.

Challenge Course Helps 
Build Student Character

Dear Editor, 
My first response to reading the 

article about the Challenge Course 
being a waste of money left me out-
raged, disappointed and offended. 
After the initial emotional outburst 
wore off, I got to thinking. You 
know my biggest complaint about 
UCSD? No one ever looks at you.  
While walking down Library Walk, 
no one makes eye contact — cell 
phones are out, iPods are on and 
eyes are down.

How did our campus get to be so 
unsociable? Why is everyone afraid 
of meeting each other and taking 
social risks? When was the last time 
UCSD encouraged you to learn from 
the people next to you?  When are 
you going to learn to rely on your 
peers and trust your own abilities 
to overcome a real-life challenge? 
Where are all these life lessons?  

There is a simple answer: the 
Challenge Course. You want to learn 
about confidence? Try climbing the 
40-foot tower with nothing holding 
you but a single rope. You want to 
learn to trust people? Try laying 
strapped into a stretcher, being held 
up by 10 strangers — three of whom 
are blindfolded — walking across 
a log. Want to learn about team-

work? Watch 12 people try to travel 
between two platforms 10 feet apart 
without touching the ground. After 
a day at the Challenge Course, you 
have no choice but to feel connected 
to the people around you. Now try 
to tell me you get that same feeling 
from a parking pass or a textbook 
exchange Web site.  

When I look back and remem-
ber UCSD, it’s the lessons I learned 
from the Challenge Course that I 
remember most. It saddens me that 
a representative of another UCSD 
program, one with the same goals 
of empowering, strengthening and 
teaching, would ever dare call those 
lessons useless and a waste of money. 
I would gladly pay the $20 to $30 fee 
(not $300) to learn what I learned 
from the Challenge Course any day.

I have just one thing to say to 
the senior staff writer and others 
who feel the same way: I’m sorry. 
I’m sorry you will never learn the 
lessons I did from the Challenge 
Course. And I’m sorry for all of 
those people you insulted out there 
who have experienced it and under-
stand its magic. I’ve said what I have 
to say. You can turn your iPods back 
on now.

office — but if this trend of automa-
tion continues what will teenagers do 
15 years from now?

When I mentioned my frustrat-
ing discovery to a friend, I was even 
further appalled when he said he 
was excited about the new  machines 
because they wouldn’t mess up his 
order the way a human might. 

Sure, a computer may be mar-
ginally more economical, and will 
definitely cut costs for executives, 
but the losses easily outweigh the 
efficiency gain — and come on cor-
porate big shots, is minimum wage 
really too pricey?

In high school I, like many, 
worked at a restaurant taking names 
and busing dishes. This taught me 
problem-solving and time-manage-
ment skills while dealing with the 
pressure of 10 whiney, unseated par-
ties, and that sometimes you just 
have to suck it up and clean that 
baby-spit-and-scrambled-egg mess, 
because no one else is going to. Not 
only are we losing a valuable source 
of entry-level work experience but,  
more importantly, we’re losing sim-
ple human contact. 

Imagine riding a remotely oper-
ated trolley to school each morn-
ing, grabbing some coffee from a 
completely mechanized cart, sitting 

through a video lecture, then going 
out with friends after class to a carni-
val where every ride is computerized 
and every concession stand is auto-
mated. While a world made solely of 
robotic relationships is the stuff of 
eerie science fiction novels, things do 
seem to be moving in that direction.

Though what we’re giving up by 
accepting these person-supplements 
is to some degree intangible, there is 
something to be gained from com-
mon human contact. Machines just 
aren’t engaging; they won’t spot you 
that nickel  and won’t help give you 
directions to the elusive product 
you’re trying to find. They’re dull, 
and sometimes they make annoy-
ing beeping noises or malfunction 
altogether.

So yes, machines might improve 
efficiency. But frankly, knowing 
where your money goes and where 
your food comes from, for example, 
are good things. 

And true, with the current Carl’s 
Jr. system I might just know that 
when I hand my money to the pim-
ply cashier it goes into a register to 
be counted and deposited at the end 
of the day, and that my milkshake 
comes from somebody in the back 
scooping soft-serve and chocolate 
syrup into a blender — but at least 
that’s something.

dents who dropped out said they did 
not like school. 

However, widening the net of stu-
dents incorporated in the API score 
does not cure the problem caused by 
dropouts not enjoying school. These 
students will most likely continue to 
fail at the same frequency despite 
any scoring changes. 

According to the text of the new 
law, schools are expected to “engag[e] 
pupils,” but how can schools engage 
students who are themselves unwill-
ing to learn, push themselves or do 
schoolwork? 

These issues heavily depend on 
parental and community involve-
ment in youth education — factors 
that the approved legislation com-
pletely fails to address. Reform is 
unlikely without tackling the core 
of the state’s secondary education 
problem.

Furthermore, the bill provides 
no funding for secondary schools 
to address the issue it demands they 
improve. 

Granted, public schools con-
stantly seem to need more money 
from state legislators to quench 
their growing troubles, but the pro-
grams necessary to revamp the sys-
tem generally require longer hours 
from teachers and added resources 
for students — demands that both 
mean higher budgets. 

However, the legislation offers 

no increased funding for schools to 
implement after-school programs, 
mentoring, tutoring and profession-
al development of educators identi-
fied by the NDPC/N as the best 
strategies for dropout prevention. 

Ironically, implementing alter-
native schooling is one of the most 
effective ways for schools to reduce 
dropout rates, yet the law would 
penalize schools that use that tactic 

by bringing down their average API 
score.

Equally troublesome are the 
effects of lower API scores on fund-
ing allotments of the state’s second-
ary schools. 

A school’s API score and its abil-
ity to increase its API score every 
year is tied directly to “monetary 
and nonmonetary awards” that a 
school can receive, according to 

the Public School Accountability 
Program. Schools that fail to meet 
API targets will lose funding, and 
could become subject to sanctions 
and eventual state intervention. 

Re-indexing the API to include 
alternative education students and 
dropouts will undoubtedly cut funds 
from the neediest schools, thus tak-
ing a backward step in education 
reform. Instead of curtailing drop-
out rates, the state will have robbed 
educators of their most prized 
resource in education improvement, 
leaving students to suffer the con-
sequences.

With so much at stake, it makes 
sense that some educators would 
push students into alternative edu-
cation programs — they would rath-
er not lose valuable funding that 
could otherwise be spent on efforts 
to lower dropout rates. 

Even if the accusations of con-
spiracy theorists are true, educators 
should not be faulted for their hon-
orable intentions. 

California’s state legislators need 
to come up with a plan that address-
es the realities of state education 
rather than antagonizing over score 
results. 

Anything less would do a tre-
mendous disservice to California 
students.

and glasses to chime against each 
other in Celeste Boursier-Mougenot’s 
“Untitled (series #3).” Although the 
artist arranged the china beforehand, 
the resulting note combinations are 
mainly left to chance, so that no two 
performances are the same. He cre-
ates a space where ordinary sounds 
are repurposed as delicate composi-
tions. 

Tim Bavington transcribed classic 
segments of rock greats into visual art, 
using his own color-wheel methodol-
ogy to represent tones as they corre-
late to the musical scale. Examining 
the way we consume music through 
material acquisition and archiving, 
Christian Marclay’s “Soundsheet” 
pokes fun at our nostalgic infatuation 
with the vinyl records. Dario Robleto 
goes one step further, stripping the 
music of physicality by removing pic-
tures and text from the album cov-
ers of deceased musicians, leaving 
behind an eerie footprint of what 
once captivated audiences. 

Popular and accessible tools like 
YouTube.com and Garageband have 
made it easier for us to shape outside 
influences of all types into more pal-
atable forms that emphasize the col-
lage-artist over the direct source. The 
exhibit showcases the ideology that 
the past can always be reinterpreted, 
and take on new relevence with an 
active manipulator and audience.

Black Dice
■ Load Blown
PAW TRACKS

A aron Warren and brothers Eric and Bjorn Copeland tend to hole themselves up in their Brooklyn practice space for months 
without seeing the sun. As Black Dice, they 
dedicate endless hours to sonic experiments that 
eventually become “songs,” but really function 
more in the public context of provocative art. The 
Dice mold electronic samples beyond the point 
of recognition, to where they must be defined 
in an entirely new language. In place of standard 
notation, the band maps out a song’s progres-
sion with self-made symbols and abbreviations, 
denoting each part and its placement. Load 
Blown, their new LP, transports us into futuristic 
drum circles, where household appliances riff off 
each other in free-jazz fluidity.

We don’t know what indigenous alien music 
would sound like, or what instruments would cre-
ate it, but we can begin to imagine how strangely 
exotic and inaccessible it would be. Black Dice 
appropriate that unfamiliar folk tone by manipu-
lating effects pedals and software into a hectic 
collage. “Bottom Feeder” ambles like a Disneyland 

ride gone awry, where the backing soundtrack to 
the attraction shifts pitch and speed as the carts 
malfunction. “Drool” resembles a fucked-up 1970s 
sci-fi soundtrack from the aliens’ point of view. 
Their society bustles beneath the Martian soil as 
humans touch down on the quiet planet. Dig the 
alien barbershop quartet on “Manoman” — its 
minimal percussion and moaning space-invader 
bloops accentuate the garbled harmonies. When 
the aliens try to communicate with humans via CB 
radio, but the language barrier poses a problem, 
they give up and start using a Morse code of pops 
and whirrs; that’s the gist of “Bananas.”

Black Dice have built a world that is at times 
fascinating and peculiar, but also distant in its 
unfamiliar origin. Load Blown will polarize any-
one curious enough to endure its noise, either 
taxing or arousing the psyche. Whether or not 
you’re feeling it now, expect their neurotic trance 
to fill dance clubs in the not-so-distant future.

T he hills of West Texas are dried and fissured, filled with harsh sand that seems ready to cave at any moment, and jagged rocky earth that yields 
vegetation only to hide its ruthlessness. Skies roll with 
menacing clouds and the rivers are so cold you’ll freeze 
before you drown.

For the Coen Brothers’ adaptation of Cormac 
McCarthy’s “No Country For Old Men,” this landscape 
could suggest any number of shadowy premises. Maybe 
it mirrors the mortality of the grizzled, solitary Llewellyn 

Moss (Josh Brolin), cluelessly opportunistic after stum-
bling upon a drug deal gone south. Or maybe it deepens 
the scars of Sheriff Ed Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), whose 
righteous moral code is challenged by his own bitter 

observations of the aforementioned melee. And perhaps 
the bleak scene also blackens Anton Chigurh (Javier 
Bardem)  — the most devastating human manifesta-
tion of evil since Darth Vader   — whose soulless 
eyes and malicious trigger have no regard 
for the innocent, condemning all life 
guilty as he by painting a vio-
lent trail of blood across the 
Southwest  desert.

Cam’ron’s Public Enemy #1 came out this week, follow-
ing Lil’ Wayne’s example as a free Internet download. 
Considering how net-based Cam’s marketing was for 
the album, we decided to hit the instant messenger 
and chat about the new mixtape, available at www.
myspace.com/killacamspace.

Willy: All right, so of course we have to start with the 
intro. Amazing.

Andres: I think Cam is making a point to come extra 
gully on the intro. He does that pretty much the entire 
tape, which is surprisingly consistent.

Willy: My favorite part is when he runs into the hip-
hop cops in Newark, and they ask him about a recent 
YouTube video. He said, “Why do y’all keep watching 
YouTube.com? Why y’all on YouTube? They said, 
‘That’s our job to be on YouTube.’” His timing is bril-
liant; he’s a comedian.

Andres: I think the first real standout is “Just Us.” 
There were two lines about giving girls Dirty Sanchez-
es... don’t know what to make of that. He even uses it 
in verb form: “Started to Sanchez her … ”

Willy: That track also highlights how the free mixtape 
can be a great new medium for rappers — they don’t 
have to clear any samples. So Cam’ron can rap about 
Dirty Sanchezes and whatever else over Journey’s 
“Don’t Stop Believin’” without facing legal troubles.

What do you think of the two new rappers Cam 
seems to be showcasing? I can’t really tell them apart, 
but I haven’t really been paying attention.

Andres: I’d say Tom Gist is better than Penz, but 
they’re really just supporting actors. They’re like 
Average Mixtape Rapper X.

Willy: And they take themselves far too seriously, 
which isn’t what Dipset is all about.

Andres: It kind of turns me off. You don’t listen to 
Dipset for harsh realities of inner-city life; I want to 
hear songs like “Cha Ching Cha Ching.”

Willy: My least favorite part has to be Duke da God’s 
incessant DJ drops. They’re pointless because this 
is not really a mixtape — it’s an album with a free 
online release.

Andres: As if DJ drops weren’t pointless already. 
What I do like is how Cam shows so many different 
sides of himself — like on “Weekend Girl” — but 
somehow all those sides deal with swagger, smoking 
hella weed, selling crack and havingsex.

Willy: But if you accept the premise that swagger, sex 
and drugs are what hip-hop is really about, Cam’ron 
does it the best, by far. 

Andres: Yeah — Cam entertains first and foremost.

Willy: As he tells the hip-hop cops on the intro, 
“This is the WWF.” Just like a professional wrestler, 
Cam’ron knows exactly what he’s doing.

BEST BETS    druthers José Gonzáléz  BELLY UP TAVERN / NOV. 26 / 9 P.M. / $18
José Gonzáléz makes no grand entrances — only 

what he can announce by way of delicate guitar picks and 
crooning vocals, ad nauseum. To his credit, he does give 
a charismatic first impression as one of Sweden’s finest 
folk-poppers — part of a curiously expanding genre whose 
musical history casually ties songwriters as classic as 
Simon & Garfunkel with composers as distinctly present 
as Yo La Tengo. 

Gonzalez may not inspire, but he can certainly hypnotize. 
His airy voice, coupled with gentle, hooked melodies, evokes 
moments of self-imposed exile or daily daze-walking 
through the streets of our home city. His is the best kind 
of background music  —  each note dropped gently as a 
snowflake with unabashed pseudo-intelligence. (JG)

It’s hard to imagine a world where 
lumpy stuffed animals are grouped 
with leopard-clad karaoke singers, but 
UCSD’s latest Master of Fine Arts exhi-
bition manages to cram an otherwise 
incohesive body of media into one 
cleanly lit space at the center of campus. 
Yes, we have an art gallery again — and 
while many pieces are worthy of a walk-
by (hey, it’s free), the overall intrigue of 
its innards is muddled by the program’s 
poorly conceived effort in textually or 
spatially unifying such thematically dis-
parate works. While there’s something 
to be said for art left open to interpreta-
tion, the gallery’s lack of supplementary 
context (save the artists’ names) often 
renders the viewer more mystified than 
moved.

Take, for instance, Evelyn Donnelly’s 
“When Will I See You Again.” At first 
glance, we see only an amorphous, blue 
furry cross between a Sesame Street 
character and alien spawn, its two con-
struction-paper eyes lending a troubled 

stare in hastily glued afterthought. At 
the show’s opening, Donnelly was avail-
able to inform puzzled observers that 
the unmarked arctic collage hanging 
three feet away was actually the back-
drop to her polyester creation, a crucial 
supplement that is easily overlooked. 
Although the artist remained enigmatic 
in her explanation (is it a representa-
tion of “Grizzly Man”? A fear of the 
unknown? A statement on global warm-
ing? Not even she seemed to know.), it’s 
an oversight that could be avoided with 
the inclusion of a simple wall label.

Steven Rubens’ series — “Watching, 
Waiting (I, II, and III)” — was less 
baffling, but still much-enhanced by 
an artist’s personal explanation. With 
a heavy background in photojournal-
ism, Rubens related his images of Iraqi 
refugees — frozen in the anonymity of 
grainy news photos — to the lack of war 
exposure in the media, and the nation’s 
collective ignorance. With this informa-
tion, the haunting clarity of the refugees’ 
gaze became instantly more relevant and 
arresting — but instead, many unin-
formed passersby left unaffected.

They were most likely waiting to 
see Emiko Lewis-Sanchez (or “Dr. 
Niku”) perform in the newest install-
ment of her pop culture “cocoons,” pink 
neon closet spaces in which she recre-
ates the evolution of celebrity iden-
tity through mechanized lip-synch (this 
time, to Eurythmics’ “Sweet Dreams”). 
As Lewis-Sanchez emerged — sporting 
animal prints, a flashy cowboy hat and 
robotic gaze — one couldn’t help but 
wonder if her piece would preserve the 
same aura after opening night, left alone 
as an empty flashing box.

A few works managed to succeed 
without explanation: Documentary 
“Maquilapolis,” traces the lives of 
women working in Tijuana’s assembly 
factories (or maquiladoras), and Caleb 
Waldorf ’s architecturally playful photo 
collage “Tower 4 (C-Print)” depicts 
hundreds of tiny buildings repeated in 
neutral tone strata. Whether or not 
you understand the rest, our very own 
University Art Gallery is a convenient 
stop en route to Hi Thai, so make sure 
to take a quick detour — the show lasts 
until Nov. 18.

Legendary filmmaker Sidney Lumet is called the “actor’s director,” 
known for breathtaking character pieces with a New Yorker’s grit, like 
“Dog Day Afternoon” or “Network” in the 1970s. Now, the director returns 
with one of his most acclaimed films — Philip Seymour Hoffman and 
Ethan Hawke play strapped-for-cash brothers (the resemblance is 
uncanny, eh?) who plot to rob their parents’ jewelry store. Naturally, 
everything goes wrong. Boasting an Oscar-buzzed cast, Lumet’s film 
reminds us where he’s been the last few decades and gifts a new 
generation with a thoughtful suspense-thriller to call their own. (CM)

TomC3 & Prince Po
■ Saga of the Simian Samurai
THRESHOLD

E very morning when Kool Keith wakes up — after the hip-hop sandman has tired of slipping LSD under his lids 
and before he’s ready to start slurpin’ on a 
bowl of Planet-Os — the loony-bin old-
timer takes another new day’s giant, messy, 
wonderfully worthless crap and calls it an 
album. An album to to which he doesn’t 
even raise a nostril before sending it down 
the sewer pipes, where it can mingle in the 
stink of every other fartsy art-rapper testing 
the waters of weird-hop.

But seriously — Keith has whipped out 
over two dozen full-lengths in the past five 
years alone. So once every few sunrises, if only 
by odds of luck, the former Ultramagnetic 
MC manages to work up something really 
absurdly hot. Unfortunately, no one has stuck 
around long enough to feel the heat — last 
year’s fetishistic, moon-romping Return of Dr. 
Octagon received microscopic recognition 
compared its hailed original. And nothing 
was slept on like Project Polaroid, produced 
by some skinny kid named TomC3 who’d 
crawled out of a conspiratory space-lab some-
where, balancing on his shaky skeleton an 
angry funk-tide and drum so heavy it’d mash 
any other white kid into sidewalk chalk. 

Thankfully, Tom made friends with the 
right street freak — Keith decided to open 

half an eyelid one morning and kick the kid’s 
stormy science experiment square in its over-
confident jaw. And thus Project Polaroid was 
born, a barely heard feat in grime that oozed 
its way through the dankest of back alleys for 
only the strays to love.

Prince Po should have known better. You’d 
think a guest spot on Polaroid would have 
been enough for the second-best Organized 
Konfusion dropout — but apparently, Tom’s 
costume box was too shiny to keep his paws 
off. It’s difficult enough to avoid imitating 
the king of strange even when steering clear 
of his beats and topics; here, Po slips down a 
rabbit hole montaged with every character 
Keith has ever played. Finally, his highness 
(joined by a heated Motion Man) stops by for 
a cameo: “Everybody’s baby fat puffed up like 
a furry rat/ You say to yourself ‘Somebody’s 
gonna need a dump truck, a bulldozer’/ F 
that,” Keith growls. “Buying the same black 
coat your friend got, where’s the success at/ 
It’s like a hundred million rappers rappin’, but 
nobody’s got the best rap.” Po is nothing but 
a kid in somebody else’s candy store — and 
when Keith is that Wonka, better watch out 
for the razors inside.

Angels and Airwaves
■ I-Empire
SURETONE/GEFFEN

B efore the release of Angels and Airwaves’ inaugural We Don’t Need to Whisper, 
lead vocalist/guitarist Tom 
Delonge (of Blink-182 fame) 
promised fans the “greatest 
rock-and-roll revolution for 
this generation.” While such 
brash confidence seemed 
slightly delusional, Delonge did 
deliver a welcomed and quite 
revolutionary reversal of 2006’s 
ubiquitous emo-band despair, 
in an intoxicating ode to the 
promised beauty of life and 
love.

The revolution rages on 
with sequel I-Empire — though 
a stagnant halt in Delonge’s 
evolution of basic soaring riffs 
and ethereal melodies indi-
cates he may be stuck in his 
pop-punk past, with structures 
too repetitive to achieve any of 
the eerie hypnosis his matured 
self now strives to achieve. The 
album requests an impossible 
amount of patience and will-
power from its listener, neces-
sary to absorb the meandering 

(yet vaguely rewarding) build-
ups and interludes that pervade 
every dramatic track.

The same monotony that 
left Blink-182 in the early 2000s 
is likewise this band’s greatest 
pitfall. Most of the group’s new 
songs are in desperate need of a 
good pruning, and all the sweet, 
innocent soliloquies to carpe 
diem that are so enthralling at 
the outset start to wear heavy 
by the album’s close. The quick, 
compact “Everything Magic” 
works toward what should 
be the celebratory climax of 
a lengthy set — “Just sit back 
and hold on, but hold on tight/ 
Prepare for the best and the 
fastest ride/ And reach out your 
hand and I’ll make you mine.” 
But the album’s peak only 
arrives after we’re emotionally 
spent, drained of any ability 
to attain Delonge’s attempted 
musical nirvana, instead ready 
to pass out and dream up a few 
fantasies of our own.

remains of a Mexican-standoff blood 
bath. One group stocked the heroin, the 
other held enough cash to keep Moss and 
his wife (Kelly Macdonald) content for 
the rest of their days. Almost a footstep 
behind him is Chigurh, who’s been hired 
to retrieve the money, and Bell, who 
finds something strangely apocalyptic in 
Chigurh’s growing murder spree.

Over the next few days, these three 
men come in close and often oblivi-
ous contact with each other — though 
not always directly, and especially not 
under amicable circumstances. In the 
most heart-racing scenes, we spy these 
near misses, as when Moss and Chigurh 
stand face-to-face with only the adjoin-
ing wall of their hotel rooms keeping the 
chaos at bay. That Chigurh’s weapon of 
choice is a high-powered rifle or, more 
often, a simple oxygen tank, makes the 
threat not only frightening, but precise 
and messy all at once.

We’re tirelessly familiar with the 
Coens’ lighter fare — “The Big Lebowski” 
and “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” are 
student favorites and fantastic comedies. 
But you’ll find no Dude or Ku Klux 
Klan dance number in these desolate 
canyons, where a mere silhouette can 
entail one’s death. Over a decade out, 
the Coens have returned to the cynical 
universe of early masterpiece “Fargo,” 
trading the Dakota snow for Texas 
dust. Both films, along with first fea-
ture “Blood Simple,” depict human exis-
tence as hopelessly flawed: We construct 
legal pillars to affirm our own brilliance, 
only to instinctively ignore them for 
our natural idiosyncracy. So it’s quite 
appropriate that the source for their lat-
est work of lightning-striking-thrice is 
McCarthy’s prose, in which characters 
often struggle for moral honor in the 
face of human brutality. These morals 
are often at odds with survival, and even 
dark behavior doesn’t go without merit. 
As the sneaky Woody Harrelson char-
acter notes, Chigurh — ruthless as his 
murders are — is still more principled 
than the rest.

What easily lifts “No Country For 
Old Men” miles above the Coens’ previ-
ous work is “Fargo” cinematographer 
Roger Deakins’ haunting portraits of 
light and shadow. Whereas the land-
scape of “Fargo” spans empty, snowy 
plains that deceptively hide the truth 
from the cops, Deakins’ desert is dan-
gerous for everyone. Hiding is not an 
option; every man’s fate is laid out before 
him in foul, predestined science.

The Coens have succeeded in fusing 
every frame with indelible meaning; each 
camera movement, each word of dia-
logue by the startlingly realistic cast, each 
desperate in Carter Burwell’s minimalist 
score. That there really is no country for 
old men is a foregone conclusion dur-
ing Bell’s opening monologue. As his 
weary voice eulogizes life, set against yet 
another sunrise, we see that the country 
gave up old men a long time ago, grant-
ing their dated existence an absolution 
of right and wrong in morality’s natural 
selection. After all, death and disorienta-
tion are a younger man’s game.

Pinchbeck routed Perlman, 6-1,

UC Riverside’s Plata over Tran.

LaPlante and the Tritons can 
now set their sights on the team’s 
season, and a bid for a fifth straight 
conference title. The quest to make 
the NCAA tournament begins on 
Feb. 2 when UCSD travels to battle 
Azusa Pacific University in Azusa, 
Calif. Conference play begins a 
week later when the Tritons host 
Cal State Bernardino.

going to win us games, but I think 
the confidence both from experi-
ence and from coach’s trust in us to 
make the right decisions will be the 
biggest difference from last year,” 
Allard said.

Carlson, who was also a staff-
er under Bruins head coach Ben 
Howland at Northern Arizona 
University and the University of 
Pittsburgh, agreed that defense is 
key in bringing the Tritons back 
from the depths of a sub-.500 sea-
son.

“Our success is going to lie in our 
ability to stop people,” he said. 

Along with the 13 returning let-
ter-winners, seven of whom started 
games last season, the Tritons will 
also welcome back senior guard Jason 
Bull, who did not play for the team 
during his junior year, and former 
CCAA Freshman of the Year guard 
Andrew Hatch, who redshirted the 
previous season due to injury. 

While the team had only one 
senior in each of the past two sea-
sons, this year’s squad will be led by 
a quartet of senior players, including 
Allard, Bull, forward Brett Stuckey 
and guard Jon Ward.

Carlson said he feels that the 
veteran leadership has already paid 
dividends.

“Having guys who have played a 
lot of games with this program and 
a lot of games at a high level like 
Clint Allard, [junior forward] Henry 

Patterson and Andrew Hatch, guys 
like that, it’s really shown up already 
in terms of their leadership skills, 
leadership ability, and leading this 
program and leading the rest of the 
guys in just trying to get a little bit 
better every day,” Carlson said.

Carlson’s first game as head coach 
ended in success this season during 
an exhibition upset over Division-I 

squad UC Riverside. Allard led the 
way with 20 points, while Hatch 
added 14 points in 26 minutes off 
the bench, and eight Tritons played 
at least 10 minutes en route to the 
67-61 victory. 

The Tritons were able to out-
rebound UC Riverside 30-28, while 
connecting on 7-of-13 three-point 
attempts. 

While the team was unable to 

duplicate the victory against anoth-
er tough D-I opponent, Drake 
University, UCSD again mounted 
a balanced attack with 11 Triton 
players scoring, led by Patterson’s 10 
points on 2-of-3 field goal shooting 
and 6-of-8 free-throw shooting.

The Tritons will face their third-
straight game against a D-I oppo-
nent when they square off against 
SDSU, but Carlson said he welcomes 
the challenge.

“I think the thing you gain [from 
playing D-I opponents] is you cer-
tainly go against a higher caliber of 
program in terms of people’s percep-
tions,” he said. “I think what hap-
pens is for us in having a chance 
to compete against UC Riverside, 
Drake [University] and [SDSU], is 
it provides a real gauge of where we 
are at.”

This season will conclude with a 
CCAA Championship Tournament 
for the conference’s top eight teams, 
preceding the NCAA D-II West 
Regional and Elite Eight tourna-
ments.

Carlson enters his first year as 
the Tritons’ head coach looking for 
his squad to excite and involve the 
UCSD campus both with success on 
the basketball court and by being 
active members of the campus com-
munity. 

“I hope we can provide the cam-
pus and the community with a team 
they can rally around — a program 
they can be proud of,” he said.

“[Of] the players that I brought in 
this year, three newcomers got all-con-
ference awards this year, which is very 
good,” Holohan said. “I’m still bringing 
a few more players that can have an 
immediate impact and then I think 
we’ll be very close.”

While it is not guaranteed that 
Holohan will return to the team next 
year, he already has plans for the team’s 
off-season, including strength and con-
ditioning programs through winter 
and competitive soccer games during 
spring in order for the team to get back 
into the playoffs. 

“We’re going to do a lot of off-sea-
son workouts,” he said. “In the summer 
we’re going to have a summer program, 
which they will have to adhere to, so 
that way when they come back next 
year in August, they’ll be that much 
more ready to go, that much more 
prepared. We want to get the team 
back to competing for the conference 
playoffs. We were a perennial NCAA 

appearance and that’s what we want to 
get back to.”

Additionally, the administration 
will be busy gathering applications and 
conducting a formal hiring process to 
select next year’s new head coach.

Holohan reiterated that he wanted 
to be back for next year and beyond.

“I really, really want the opportu-
nity,” Holohan said. “I think the players 
and myself have a good working rela-
tionship and I really want the oppor-
tunity ... I look forward to doing that if 
given the chance.”

Levy said he believed that most of 
the players would welcome and sup-
port Holohan’s return.

“There is a definite overall feel-
ing that he did a good job,” Levy said. 
“There is an evaluation of the coach 
every year and I’m not sure what the 
overall consensus was. But with most 
players returning, I would assume 
probably that they won’t mind him 
back with the success late in the sea-
son.”

HOT CORNER

Young Team Has Bright Future
By Joo Yoon
Staff Writer

One year removed from a 7-10-2 
season, the UCSD men’s soccer team 
finished this past season with anoth-
er sub-.500 record. But this season’s 
results marked the first time in the 
storied program’s history that the team 
posted losing records in two consecu-
tive seasons, and the longest stretch 
between playoff berths, with the last 
one coming in 2003. 

The Tritons knew that they would 
be hard-pressed to be successful this 
season after losing four All-California-
Collegiate-Athletic-Association players 
last year. The team was expecting a 
rebuilding year — the lineup was com-
prised of 16 freshmen and sophomores 
and just three seniors — and its play in 
the beginning of the season definitely 
reflected its youthfulness and inexperi-
ence.

Senior captain and defender Josh 
Levy said that coming into the season, 
the team had to be careful of having 
overly optimistic expectations about 
its success.

“I think basically when we started 
out, we knew that we had a large num-
ber of new guys, so taking that into 
account, we couldn’t have too high 
hopes, too extreme hopes that were 
not practical,” Levy said. “Our basic 
goal was to get into the CCAA playoffs, 
and it seemed like a reasonable goal at 
the time.”

The Tritons then suffered a sud-
den and shocking loss when head 
coach Derek Armstrong abruptly 
retired, because of health issues, just 
eight games into his 26th season at the 
helm. 

Athletic Director Earl Edwards said 
that while Amstrong’s retirement was 
unexpected, he had no choice but to 
respect his wishes and accept his retire-
ment.

“That was a total shock to every-
body: to the players, to the coaching 
staff [and] to the administration, partic-

ularly during the season,” Edwards said. 
“But we understood once he explained 
what was going on with his knee and 
it was clear that he couldn’t continue, 
so we were just fortunate to have an 
assistant like [interim head coach Paul 
Holohan] that could step in and get the 
team not only though the season but to 
get through on a very high note.”

After taking over, Holohan led the 
Tritons to a respectable 4-3-2 record, 
including a huge win against then-No. 
6 Seattle Pacific University for his first 
victory as head coach. Under Holohan’s 
guidance, the team went on an unde-
feated streak over the season’s last four 
games, winning three and playing to 
a draw against Cal State Stanislaus on 
Oct. 21.

Holohan had high praise for his 
squad and said he appreciated the effort 
that the Tritons put forth throughout 
the season.

“We knew that we were going to be 
a young team and it was going to be a 
rebuilding year,” he said. “Our goal was 

to do the best we could and see what 
we had. We always wanted to make the 
conference playoffs because we always 
want to try to do that every year.”

Despite the relatively young team, 
not all was bad for the Tritons this sea-
son, as evidenced by three All-CCAA 
team selections, just one less nomi-
nation than last year. Junior forward 
Jason Le, a transfer from Vanderbilt 
University who led the team in scor-
ing with five goals in just 13 matches, 
and junior goalkeeper Peter Akman, 
a transfer from Mesa Community 
College who had a 1.43 goals-against 
average, each earned All-CCAA second 
team awards. Freshman defender Jared 
Kukura received honorable-mention 
honors for his work in the backfield.

Holohan was very proud of the 
achievements and looked forward to 
more newcomers next year to help 
push the Tritons back to the top of the 
CCAA.

Doubles Struggles Cap Fall Season

SANH LUONG/GUARDIAN FILE
Senior Justine Ang Fonte was one of many Tritons who had a hard time at the UC Irvine Invitational, 
losing her singles match and falling 8-0 in her doubles match with freshman Dalya Perlman.

By Neil Joshi
Staff Writer

The UCSD women’s tennis team 
finished its fall season on Nov. 
10 and Nov. 11 at the UC Irvine 
Invitational, where head coach Liz 
LaPlante sent nine of her best play-
ers to compete in the singles and 
doubles tournaments.

The four-time California 
Collegiate Athletic Association con-
ference champions had high expec-
tations going into the invitational, 
but had a rude awakening after 
they struggled in doubles play and 
went a combined 0-7 in the two-day 
tournament.

The troubles in doubles play 
began on day one, when the four-
time CCAA Conference Champion 
Tritons went 0-3, with every loss 
coming against a squad from 
Northern Arizona University. 
Senior Justine Ang Fonte and fresh-
man Dalya Perlman lost to the 
Northern Arizona University tan-
dem of Kim Van Ginkle and Leslie 
Vial 5-8, while UCSD freshmen 
Taskeen Bains and Kimmie Dao 
lost 3-8 to Edit Suhajda and Orsi 
Golovics. The day’s final loss came 
from the Triton doubles team of 
freshman Valerie Tang and senior 

Molly Sullens, who also lost 8-3 to 
Amiee Oki and Yumi Hasegawa.

The problems continued into 
the next day where UCSD went 
0-4, completing a winless tourna-
ment in doubles. Dao and Bains 
were defeated 3-8 by the UC Irvine 
doubles team of Heidi Kaloi and 
Brooke Bartlett, while junior Tessa 
Tran and sophomore Pooja Desai 
lost their only doubles match of the 
weekend, a lopsided 1-8 defeat to 
the UC Riverside duo of Angelique 
Corpuz and Erynne Oki. Fonte and 
Perlman had the most discourag-
ing result of the day, losing 8-0 to 
UC Riverside’s Roxanne Plata and 
Donna McCullough. The weekend’s 
final doubles result was an 8-5 loss 
by Tang and Sullens at the hands of 
UC Riverside sisters Yassaman and 
Nadia Sakhakorn.

If the uninspiring doubles play 
at Anteater Invitational is any indi-
cation of the Tritons’ ability, they 
may struggle in the spring season.

However, although LaPlante 
wasn’t too worried about her team’s 
disappointing showing, she knows 
that the squad has a lot to work on.

“It’s still early,” she said. “We are 
working toward improving so that 
we can hit our stride when the team 
season begins in February.”

In singles competition, UCSD 
was able to turn its luck around, 
going 4-3 on the first day of action. 
Perlman was the first to redeem 
herself, winning a 7-6, 6-2 decision 
over Yassaman Sakhakorn of UC 
Riverside. Joining her in the win 
column were Dao, a 6-0, 6-3 winner 

over UC Riverside’s Corpuz, Fonte, 
who won 6-4, 6-1 over Ali Welliver 
of UC Irvine, and Tang, who beat 
Alexandra Khoury of UC Riverside 
6-2, 7-6. Other singles action from 
Nov. 10 saw Tran lose 6-4, 6-4 
to Hasegawa of Northern Arizona 
University, and Bains go down 6-
4, 6-2 to Regan Newman, also of 
Northern Arizona University.

If the Tritons hope to have any 
success this season, they will cer-
tainly look to depend on Desai. She 
has been an asset to the team in the 
past, but is working to recover from 
a foot injury that has plagued her 
for the last month.

“Pooja has been steadily improv-
ing her game since the injury,” 
LaPlante said. “We expect her to be 
one of the most important players 
on our team this season.” 

Although Desai stumbled early 
and lost her first singles match of 
the tournament, 6-1, 6-2 to Nadia 
Sakhakorn of UC Riverside, she 
showed tremendous heart in win-
ning her next match, a 6-7, 7-5, 7-5 
marathon against Oki.

The rest of the team didn’t have 
as much luck on Nov. 11 as Bains 
was the only other Triton to win her 
match. Her victory was decisive, a 6-
2, 6-1 beatdown of Shawnell Russell 
of Loyola Marymount University. 
Alexsa Costa of New Mexico 
State University defeated Dao 6-
2, 6-2, while her teammate Bianca 
Discordia beat Tang 6-4, 7-5. Yumi 
Hasegawa and Stacey Pinchbeck of

under new leadership and renewed 
hopes.

Following former head coach 
Bill Carr’s departure, the Tritons 
found a new head coach during 
the off-season. Chris Carlson, a 
San Diego native who served as 
UCLA’s director of basketball opera-
tions over the previous four seasons, 
was announced as the Tritons’ head 
coach in June and will lead a team 
that, apart from the new head coach, 
will remain remarkably consistent 
with 13 returning letter-winners.

Carlson said he wanted the job 
because he believes in the Tritons’ 
ability and is confident that they will 
be CCAA title contenders.

“I’ve always believed in the prom-
ise and the potential of UCSD, both 
as an institution and as an athletic 
department,” he said. “The chance 
to be the head basketball coach here 
is something I’ve always found to be 
really enticing.”

Senior guard Clint Allard, who 
has started all but 10 of the games 
he has played throughout his UCSD 
career, described Carlson as very 
personable and has found him to be 
a good teacher of the game.

Pacific BeachIN-N-OUT BURGER

The Pacific Beach In-n-Out Burger is always a classic destination. With made-to-
order staples and a secret menu 
we’ve loved since high school, it’s 
hard to beat the chain’s friendly 
service (not to mention those 
iconic hats). Only problem is, In-
n-Out isn’t open 24 hours. But if 
you do manage to get yourself 
down there before it closes, be 
sure to make those fries animal-
style — who knew Thousand 
Island and onions could be so 
delicious? Only problem is, In-
n-Out isn’t open 24 hours. But if 
you do manage to get yourself 
though the door before closing 
time, be sure to order those 
fries animal-style — who knew 
Thousand Island and onions 
could induce such euphoria?

Whether induced by inebriation or extensive studying, late-night hunger 
can hardly be ameliorated in the early-to-bed La Jolla bubble. So next 
time you’re craving something hearty at 1 a.m. — and OceanView Terrace 
burritos don’t look so appealing for the seventh night in a row — it’s time 
to venture off campus for some good-old fast food.

C hances are, though, if you’re really pulling a late night you’ll miss the In-n-Out oppor-tunity-window before hunger really hits 
you. So ditch PB and head down Miramar Road 
to Carl’s Jr. where the milkshakes are bountiful 
and the kitchen doesn’t close. Sure, the automated 
order-takers are creepy, but with a supremely 
extensive selection, this fast-food giant is guaran-
teed to please your late-night pallet.

O r if you’re not in the mood for burgers, cruise down Miramar Road a little farther to Roberto’s, for San Diego’s hands-down 
best after-hours Mexican food. If you get the easy-
going kind of hunger pains, go with the archetyp-
al carne asada burrito. But don’t worry if you’re 
more finicky, the friendly cashiers are down to 
customize your order — cheese fries anyone? And 
not only is Roberto’s 
delicious; it’s also 
cheap, which

SUSHI
Sushi Deli 2, 
Downtown San Diego

Located in the heart of downtown, 
you might expect Sushi Deli 2 to be as 
hoity-toity as its ritzy Horton Plaza 
neighbors. But despite all odds, deli-
cious and cheap sushi has landed in 
the midst of San Diego’s nightlife. 

Enclosed in a tiny urban nook, 
Sushi Deli 2 manages to rotate tables 
quickly, leaving you waiting for a bit 
but not dying of hunger at the door. 
And, the food is well worth the wait 
because, despite its name, Sushi Deli 
isn’t just for sushi lovers. It has tasty 
combos featuring four different types 
of rolls for around $8 and excellent 
single rolls starting at $4, as well 
as bento boxes and miso soup. The 
only downside to Sushi Deli 2 is that, 
because it’s in the heart of downtown, 
you might have to fight for street-side 
parking. 

The trick is to bring a large group 
of people and share roll after roll so 
that you’ll walk out of the deli $11 
poorer but stuffed to the gills with 
sushi goodness. And if downtown is 
too far away, the restaurant has two 
sister locations in Hillcrest and on 
Clairemont Mesa Boulevard.

BREAKFAST
Hash House A Go Go 
Hillcrest

With its extravagantly gener-
ous, mouth-watering servings, Hash 
House A Go Go wins the title of San 
Diego’s Best Breakfast. Not far from 
the heart of Hillcrest, this award-
winning restaurant draws crowds of 
hungry visitors from all over San 
Diego each morning — especially on 
weekends, when the wait can be up to 
an hour long. 

But the wait is worth it for Hash 
House’s farm-inspired, industrial 
atmosphere, which complements 
its elaborate presentation of savory 
American-style comfort foods while 
providing a hip flair and stylish inte-
rior to the restaurant. 

The menu is full of simple yet 
delectable breakfast items, rang-
ing from farm scrambles to gigan-
tic Snickers pancakes and griddled 
French toast dipped in banana cinna-
mon cream with pecan maple syrup. 
Sample one of the House Hashes, 
tossed with tasty eggs, crispy sea-
soned potatoes and accompanied by  
a biscuit and fresh fruit.

Just be sure to bring your appe-
tite — the Hash House’s oversized 
portions are more than enough to 
satisfy you and a friend. Though the 
surfboard-sized plates might be over-
whelming to newcomers, the reson-
able prices will definitely have you 
coming back for seconds.

BEST KARAOKE
Karaoke joints are a dime-a-dozen (hell, my 

shower is a karaoke joint), especially when you’re 
looking around San Diego’s Convoy Street, the 
mecca for all mic-equipped Asians. Denizens visit 
the area’s many Asian businesses, from super-
markets to banks and video stores. Complexes 
neighboring the hole-in-the-wall J Music Studio 
(conspicuously absent from the Yellow Pages) 
house the famed Tapioca Express, site of Asian 
habitues sipping on boba, and Sunny Donuts, an 
old-time eatery with a classic ambience. So grab a 
pho bowl, slam down sake, then rent out a kara-
oke room at J Music Studio to croon, serenade 
and tickle that inner diva.

Reenactments can go beyond Beyonce or 
Celine — there’s a host of Korean songs to go 
along with a latter-day pop selection ranging 
from Akon to Snoop Dogg.

Considering most karaoke establishments 

offer similarly 
listless song 
choices, it’s hard to judge a place by its catalog. 
Its decor, then? J Music has walls that belong in 
an off-color Howard Johnson, and carpet that’s 
not much better. Could it be the price? Forty 
bucks an hour per room ain’t bad, but that’s 
standard price. Maybe it’s the tambourine they 
lend upon request? Can’t be.

J Music Studio is this year’s pick because 
I feel about it the same way I feel about my 
first bike: it may have not been the best, but 
I sure do remember my times with it. Equally 
memorable times at J Music Studio include 
Mariah Carey, Britney Spears, R. Kelly and a 
whole lot of booze. And who could ask for bet-
ter company?

The Lamplighter opens at 6 a.m., and happy hour lasts

just a little out of place — serious alcoholics really do 
go there for early-morning cocktails. Come back at 10 
p.m. and the place will be packed with a bizarre mix of 
drunks — North Park hipsters, East County bros, college 
students, professionals and your regular run-of-the-mill 
San Diego douchebags. 

The drinks are cheap (ask for a Lamplighter Ale), but 
the real draw is the karaoke sideshow that goes on all

The winding trek down to our secluded Black’s Beach — for tour-ist-free sand castles by day or 
full-moon drum circles by night — is
more than worth it during the standard two years on

J ust as its moniker hints, Obelisk: the Bookstore, located on University Avenue in Hillcrest, is a shaft of light for San Diego’s gay community. It 
offers how-to literature on coming out, gay marriage, encountering 
adversity and the like, covering topics from gender roles to Karma 
Sutra. As a bonus, the pet-friendly bookstore also offers pride prod-
ucts such as rainbow-soaked towels, doggy-wear and mugs. For 
those looking for a bit more excitement but weary of the sleazy sex-
shop stink, Obelisk tastefully houses an impressive display of erotic 
homosexual videos, magazines, lubes and shaft rings.

Although merchandise like Village People teddy bears make it 
obvious where the shop’s loyalties lie, Obelisk’s eccentric collection 
of nude calendars, complete with steamy girl-on-girl photos and 
snapshots of chiseled asses, can appeal to any straight guy or girl. 
Also, friends looking to deliver some extra-special birthday cheer 
can choose from cards featuring three-dimensional penises or down-
right unflattering nude close-ups. Gender-neutral goods, such as Bill 
Clinton’s biography and “Desperate Housewives” DVDS are also 
available. No matter which way you swing, Obelisk is an intriguing 
book-nook well worth a visit.

be sure to have enough money when you show up; these sweets are 
expensive, especially for on student’s budget. So save up and go buy

MEXICAN FOOD
Pokez, 
Downtown San Diego

Pokez isn’t just any San Diego Mexican restaurant. The walls are 
packed with customized artwork; everything from huge canvas paint-
ings to skateboards and photos. The service is also unconventional; 
— everyone who works there seems to have a genuine personality. 
But most importantly, the food is amazing. Boasting everything from 
spinach soyrizo (vegetarian Mexican sausage) burritos, to homemade 
soups and delicious enchiladas, Pokez serves a variety of classic 
Mexican dishes and original alternatives at affordable prices. To make 
things even better, it recently re-opened its bar after a lengthy hiatus, 
fully equipped with a jukebox and pool tables. But what really puts 
Pokez a cut above is its community spirit, reflected in its artwork and 
patrons. People of all walks of life frequent the restaurant, proving 
that it’s not just alternative-eating boho shit. Pokez has grown to be a 
sub-culture staple of San Diego, and the restaurant of 20-something 
years continues to be locally owned and operated. If you still have yet 
to try Pokez, please do yourself a favor: give Roberto’s a break and try 
some real food.

PIZZA
Regents Pizzeria, 
La Jolla

Located conveniently near to campus, Regents Pizzeria serves up 
pies to impress any well-traveled connoisseur. It offers both the New 
York flat-and-foldable — dripping ever so slightly in glorious grease 
— and Chicago’s deep, and even more delicious, dishes. (This pizza is 
so good it’ll make you alliterate.) But seriously, Regents is the ultimate 
La Jolla treasure hidden in a Pottery Barn wasteland of bland. 

With the option for delivery (note the classic brandless boxes) and 
prices comparable to any cookie-cutter pizza shack, there’s no reason 
not to check it out. 

Ignite your inner angry cabbie and order a meat lover’s New York 
plate, or grab some silverware and tackle a Chicago style monster. Or
if you’re perfectly content with your pleasant little unaccented self 
go for something a little left-of-center; nothing tops the New York 
style white. 

So whether you’re searching for one of the two iconic pizza-eating 
experiences or just something new, hit up Regents for a little attitude 
and a lot of damn-good food.

Smacked with an eye-catching XXXX logo — that’s right, four Xs — and located conveniently off Route 52, Adult four Xs — and located conveniently off Route 52, Adult fourEmporium II offers the most extensive array of grown-up 
entertainment you could ever want or imagine. 

Simply put, this 24-hour sex shop makes traditional XXX 
adult stores look like child’s play. And until we decriminalize 
it, child’s play may be the only thing the store lacks; browsing 
aisles upon aisles of pornographic DVDs, you will find an 
impressive selection capable of making even the most seasoned 
adult-store veteran pause for a second take. 

From the usual gay porn, straight porn and obligatory 
midget porn to “Chicks With Dicks,” “Large and Lovely” and 
“Cumfart” (not even joking), the emporium leaves nothing to 
the imagination. Why ever imagine sex, especially when 50,000 
titles are displayed right in front of you? 

If you need help browsing the massive selection for that 
hard-to-find fetish flick or obscure dildo length, don’t be afraid 

to ask. And there’s a store bonus: 
this shop offers 160-channel, air-
conditioned private minitheaters if roommates are occupying 
your whack-off space.

Even if videos aren’t your thing, the store features an exten-
sive toy and accessory area complete with the fattest and lon-
gest dildos — and fists — you’ll probably ever see. Along with 
a variety of flavored lubricants comes a multicultural seletion 
of blow-up dolls (some molded from on actual porn stars!) 
Also available are penis pumps and those inflatable bounce-
balls normally used for exercise — except now equipped with 
a rideable appendage. 

Even if you don’t buy anything, a visit to Adult Emporium  
II is well worth it. Something you never even thought existed 
might catch your eye. And at the very least, the store offers 
great gag gifts.

C atering to a neighbor-hood full of college-dropout bros, surfers with long blond locks and 
the mooching bitches that hang with them, Pacific Beach’s 
Garnet Avenue is lined with smoke shops, including the 
perennial Da Glassworks (last year’s choice for “Best 
Smoke Shop”). Wiseguys, though, belong at the Godfather 
Smoke Shop, where “smoking” a fool doesn’t require kill-
ing anything but brain cells.

But beyond the legendary status of its namesake, the 
Godfather stands above the hood’s other smoking estab-
lishments. Its sweeping selection covers all manner of 
stoner-ism, from simples pieces to mechanized vaporizers 
and fully stocked bongs. The store’s glass-related artistry 
is always an awing sight to behold; I could spend hours 
counting one bong’s many chambers — I’d just have to be 
lit as hell.

And as always with establishments of notoriety, hag-
gling is an accepted practice. Try to buy in bulk for the 
chance to lower your price.

edgewise. Instead, head the extra five 
minutes down La Jolla Boulevard to a 
significantly less crowded Windansea, 
this beach town’s best-kept and most 
historically awesome secret.

With just the right ratio of clean, 
powdered-sugar sand (for the tan) and 
cool rocks (for the cave-happy kid 
in you), Windansea’s always-changing 
shore sees a younger and more laid-
back crowd than its northern sisters, 
drawing the more motivated (read: 
lower alcohol content) of nearby Pacific 
Beachers and maintaining La Jolla’s 
beercan-free class. The surf is rough on 
beginners — and the territorial regu-
lars are even tougher — but become 
one of the dedicated few and you’ll 
never go back to any other beach. Just 
stake out a deserted ledge, bask in the 
shade of the palm-leafed Surf Shack, 
feel the spray from an exhilaratingly 
close break and thank the Sun God 
that you’re not caught beneath a heap 
of fly-buzzing kelp and sunburnt fam-
ily vacations — or that stray nudist 
looking for his comrades at the other 
end of Black’s.

into sets that can reach over 20 feet.
The steep, breathtaking cliffs that 

seclude the beach are the spot’s saving 
grace, keeping crowds — and cops 
— on top of the hill. The beach is also 
famed for the nudist, naturist groups 
that coexist with surfers despite a 1976 
citywide nudity ban. The clothing-
optional status on the north side of the 
beach, the notorious full-moon festi-
vals held once a month and epic surf 
all meld together to form the Black’s 
experience that we know and love.

Black’s Beach

While you can count on a few old standbys among the 20-some-
odd beers on tap at Porter’s Pub, plenty are rotated seasonally, with 
a decent spread of brews to please anyone. When you’re done brush-
ing up on quantum mechanics, the pub’s happy hour discounts and 
respectable selection of pale and amber ales, porters and stouts make 
it a great place to educate yourself on beer’s sensory pleasures. Those 
with something to prove can knock back a pint of Arrogant Bastard 
Ale (with a girlish 12 percent alcohol content).

Dim lighting and a friendly atmosphere make the pub a great 
place to kick it with your friends (or make new ones); the eclectic 
decor’s questionable humor reflects the approachable, laid-back staff. 
An outdoor patio with ample seating and an open grill gives you the 
opportunity to sober up over a burger before your evening classes. 
While service speed from the kitchen can vary wildly, the sandwich 
combos, melts, salads and fried stuff are usually worth the wait; weekly 

shows will keep you coming back to the Student Center.
With over 20 beers on tap, Round Table Pizza cultivates a sports-Round Table Pizza cultivates a sports-Round Table Pizza

bar feel: A big-screen television and generous indoor seating make it 
an ideal gathering spot for the Super Bowl and 2008 Olympics, and 
the selection of domestic beers is respectable. Round Table’s location 
in Price Center — the center of UCSD, and the intersection of the 
campus’ two largest footpaths — along with plenty of outdoor seating 
make it a natural place to meet friends. Capitalize on monthly specials 
and occasional pitcher deals. The pizza isn’t bad, either.

The focus at Price Center’s Shogun is the food, and as such the 
beer selection is painfully limited to two ubiquitous Japanese imports. 
However, it’s also the only place on campus with warm (or chilled) 
sake and plum wine. The adjacent game room lends itself to intense, 
sake-fueled ping-pong battles; the moderate selection of sushi can 
keep you busy while you nurse an Asahi.

Anyone who claims that UCSD’s student body has a hottie defi-
ciency clearly isn’t looking hard enough. Start with the clearly isn’t looking hard enough. Start with the clearly RIMAC gym. 
RIMAC is gold for hunk-scoping because, as we all know, PIKE has 
mandatory workout hours. Furthermore, the elliptical machines are 
strategically positioned above the renowned weightlifting pit, so car-
dio-crazed, bronze-legged sorority sisters can bask in the testosterone 
secretions of their male counterparts. Don’t forget to catch these 
gazelle-like sisters thrusting their hips in sexually suggestive yoga 
moves on the stretch mat (just don’t get ringworm). 

Your next best bet would probably be International House
(because, let’s face it, foreign imports are usually of a higher caliber). 
The reason why everyone likes out-of-the-country hotties is because 
they’re always up for a good time, and thus will throw out-of-control 
parties. International students also tend to have: 1) fewer inhibitions, 
2) better fashion senses and 3) sexy accents.

Finally — and this is going to seem obvious — the Price Center
food court offers an array of delicious goods — and I’m not talking 
about the orange chicken. Take your pick: the Alpha Epsilon Pi guys 
congregate outside the Sunshine Store (there are usually about six of 
them at any given hour), or inside, where Espresso Roma’s magnetic 
force attracts an inordinate amount of painfully good-looking teach-
er’s assistants (maybe you’ll share a cup o’ Joe with that Chemistry 
tutor you’ve been eyeing). 

ON-CAMPUS SPOT TO...

BEST CHECK THE HOTTIES TAKE A CAT NAP
Not only is the new Student Center Lounge a great place to 

grab Thai food or study, its comfy chairs and wall-length padded 
benches are perfect for grabbing a post-all-nighter nap between 
classes. Although restaurant noise does permeate the scene, this area 
is by far the comfiest — no matter what the weather. If it’s a bright 
day outside (but you’re too concerned with wildlife and passersby 
to sleep out on the lawn) sunlight beats through the floor-to-ceiling 
windows, warming the atrium-like study room; and if it’s cold the 
lounge has a super-cute fireplace that is prime for curling up beside. 
But if the thought of rubberneckers psychs you out, you can always 
opt for a more private locale — try one of Geisel’s study rooms. 
True, the harsh tables aren’t nearly as comfortable, but the space is 
quiet and you won’t have to worry about having your exhaustion-and you won’t have to worry about having your exhaustion-and
drool judged by an onlooker. Plus, when you wake up still tired and 
grumpy, you can always run down to the front lounges and laugh at 
people checking themselves out in the one-way mirrors.

Or if you really are a nature lover, but want to avoid the crowds 
of Student Center and Library Walk, there’s always the lawn beside 
Warren Mall. Just lie back all hippie-like beneath the shade of a tree; 
the land is slightly sloped, which allows moisture to runoff and stops 
the soggy-back phenomenon from happening. So though there’s 
nothing like the comfort of your own bed, campus does have some 
sweet nappy-time spots.
