Grappling with a $564 mil-
lion budget shortfall, the 
California State University sys-
tem announced plans Tuesday 
to cut enrollment by 40,000 stu-
dents over the next two years.

“Denying students access to 
the California State University 
is just about the worst thing I 
can do during a recession,” 
Chancellor Charles B. Reed said. 
“But we have to provide a quality 
higher education to students, and 
we cannot educate more students 
with less.”

The university system 
received 266,152 applications 
this year, a 53-percent increase 
from last year. CSU officials 
attribute most of the increased 
demand to  students hoping to 
transfer from community col-
lege, who had to wait to apply in 
the fall after spring enrollment 
was cancelled last year.

“One thing I know is that 
in the past, Cal State was very 
lenient in admitting students 
who hadn’t completed all of 
their course work or liberal arts 
requirements,” Reed said. “I 
believe those students are going 
to be turned away.”

According to the Contra 
Costa Times, the campuses will 
cut enrollment by adhering more 
strictly to CSU policy on aca-
demic dismissal of students who 
aren’t performing well, while 
potentially eliminating winter 
and spring admission for the 
2010-11 academic year.

“The state funds a finite 
number of [students],” Cal Poly 
spokesman Tim Lynch told the 
Contra Costa Times. “If the uni-
versity exceeds that number, it 
incurs the entire cost of edu-
cation for those additional stu-
dents. Yes, those additional stu-
dents will pay fees, but those

State universities consider cutting winter and spring 
enrollment, enforcing stricter academic policies.

A GOOD YEAR

Since opening in Fall Quarter 2008, the Loft 
has hosted a wide variety of events, from punk 
concerts to wine tastings. During the 2009 
presidential innaguaration, students gathered 
to watch President Barack Obama be sworn 
into ofﬁce. Recently, indie/hip hop troupe 
Why? drew a packed house on Oct. 22.

B arely a year after the A.S. Council declined to sponsor a student-fee referendum to fund the Loft — Price Center East’s year-old multipurpose venue — some councilmem-bers are reconsidering the request but discussing a pos-
sible effort to lower the proposed fee, which has climbed to $4.91. 

The A.S. Associate Vice President of Academic Affairs and 
chair of the University Centers Advisory Board Jordan Taylor, a 
member of the A.S. special committee currently discussing the 
proposed referendum, said councilmembers are working to deter-
mine an appropriate Loft fee using enrollment numbers. Based on 
recent figures provided by the Office of the Registrar,  the commit-
tee suggested redistributing the fee from the originally proposed 
$4.91 for undergraduates to $4.47 for undergraduates and $3.82 
for graduate students.

The men’s water-polo team rose from a hit-and-miss season to slam-dunk their final regular-season 
game of 2009, which they played against Santa Clara University. The win will play as a key factor in 
determining the team’s seed in the upcoming Western Water-Polo Championships, beginning Nov. 20.

UCSD graduate student Luke 
Barrington, along with the UCSD 
Computer Audition Lab, has created 
a music recommendation program 
to rival the iTunes Genius feature.

Barrington and his colleagues 
took the idea behind the popular 
Apple software — recommending 
new songs to users based on what 
they already like — and created a 
program that makes suggestions 
based on sounds and acoustic con-
tent of a song, rather than suggesting 
commonly related artists or utilizing 
the purchase history of others who 
also purchased the song.

“[Apple Genius] is great and 
works well on a filter system,” 
Barrington said. “It has over 6 billion 
songs and tons of collaborative data, 
so if you are buying a certain song 
from iTunes, chances are that it has 
had people who have also bought 
that song.” 

Even if the songs in a user’s 
library were downloaded elsewhere, 
Apple Genius uses Gracenote soft-
ware to analyze songs and match 
them to tunes in their database. 

Barrington’s music recommenda-
tion program, on the other hand, 
analyzes the acoustic content of the 
song and then matches it with other 
similar-sounding songs within the 
same genre.

“We’re trying to have a machine 
that listens to music, and then 
analyzes the song based on the 
sounds of that particular song,” 
Barrington said.

Because of its more complex 
design, Barrington said his pro-
gram will be able to recommend 
a greater range of songs. Apple 
Genius is limited to recom-
mending songs available for 
purchase in the iTunes store. 

However, creating a pro-
gram that actually “listens” 
to the acoustic content 
of every song has 

proven a vast undertaking, accord-
ing to Barrington. In order to make 
a recommendation, the program has 
to review over 50 examples of each 
genre before analyzing a song, in 
order to determine what genre it will 

fall into. 
To provide initial data 

for his music recommen-
dation program, Barrington 

created the Twitter computer 
game Herd It.

Herd It requires players 
to answer questions such as 
“Is this song happy, sad or 
romantic?” based on the 
music playing. The player 
gets points if his or her 

answer matches everyone 
else’s, thus motivating players to 

categorize songs into their most 
correct genres. The music recom-
mendation program could then use 
the players’ answers as base genre 
examples. 

“The idea behind Herd It is 
to collect consensus,” Barrington 

said. “So even if some people answer 
incorrectly or weirdly, we get the 
average response of all users. In the 
future, we plan to learn person or 
demographic-specific models... like 
‘Girls from SoCal think that this 
tune rocks,’ or ‘European housewives 
find this song romantic’.” 

Herd It attracted over 2,000 players 
in three days, all of whom have made 
the music recommendation program 
more efficient, Barrington said.

Barrington presented his pro-
gram at the International Society 
for Music Information Retrieval 
Conference in Japan on Oct. 28.

In the future, Barrington hopes to 
use the software to provide recom-
mendation data for local San Diego 
bands who have not yet released 
albums on iTunes, and therefore 
would not appear in Apple Genius.

So far, Apple has not acknowl-
edged the program.

NEWS� THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 2009� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 3 

Loft Director Martin Wollesen 
presented a similar referendum to 
the council during Winter Quarter 
2009, but councilmembers voted to 
exclude the Loft fee — then proposed 
at $2.62 per student per quarter — 
from the A.S. activity-fee referendum, 
after determining that the Loft did 
not exhibit enough need compared to 
other items on the ballot. 

After Wollesen brought the request 
before the council a second time dur-
ing Spring Quarter, the council once 
again denied the Loft a place on the 
spring ballot, this time due to concerns 
over a lack of student oversight in 
the venue’s operations. A.S. President 
Donna Bean was particularly reluctant 
to allocate student funds to a facility 
that did not have students on its board 
of managers. 

According to Taylor, 
oversight is once again a 
crucial issue in the discus-
sion of this year’s referen-
dum request.

“It’s important to know 
who would oversee fees 
and make sure they would 
be spent correctly,” he said. 
“We’re trying to work with 
A.S. to determine the best 
setup and review language  
of oversight together.”

However, A.S. 
President Utsav Gupta 
said discussion of over-
sight language is prema-
ture at this time.

“We first need to find 
out if there should be a 
referendum at all,” he said. 
“Personally, I believe student over-
sight is key to any referendum to go 
through A.S. and a cause I want to 
continually advocate.” 

Wollesen said he, too, supports 
giving students a place in determining 
the  the venue’s operations. 

“It is absolutely appropriate for 
students to provide oversight of the 
budget they fund,” he said. “We think 
this is a good thing.”

Taylor suggested a system where 
students from organizations such as 
UCAB, Associated Students and the 
Graduate Student Association would 
have influence over Loft spending and 
re-approve budgets on a yearly basis. 

In this scenario, if the Loft accrued 
an excessive amount of debt, the board 
could reevaluate the budget and vote 
to redefine student contributions.

“A referendum is essentially a con-
tract to better the stuadents,” Taylor 
said. “We need to make sure we have 
some control over our money. For 
example, if the board says we’re not 
happy with how things are going and 

how money is being spent, we can say 
that those funds can’t be filled.” 

The Loft is currently financed by a 
combination of one-time funds from 
the Student Affairs Office, student 
registration fees and external sources 
of revenue such as profits from venue 
rental and ticket sales. 

According to Associate Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Ed 
Spriggs, the Loft’s current location 
in Price Center East was originally 
planned as additional space for the 
Alumni Association. 

“When sufficient funding could 
not be raised from donations to fund 
that part of the construction, Student 
Affairs stepped in and essentially pur-
chased the space from the campus,” he 
said, adding that the Student Affairs 
department provided money suffi-

cient to fund three-quar-
ters of Loft operations. 

Twenty-one percent of 
the Loft’s current operat-
ing budget is financed by 
registration fees, includ-
ing the salaries of two 
full-time staffers. 

The venue’s other 
sources include funds con-
tributed by A.S. Concerts 
& Events and University 
Centers, which both allo-
cate roughly $30,000 per 
year to the Loft. 

Wollesen said current 
sources of funding are not 
enough to maintain Loft 
operations. 

“While the Reg Fee 
Committee is very sup-
portive of the Loft, it does 

not have the resources to fund its 
event budget,” Wollesen said.

As of Winter Quarter 2010, the 
venue will no longer have a major 
source of funding, which would result 
in fewer events, admission changes, 
rental charges for student organiza-
tions and student layoffs, he said. The 
A.S. referendum, if passed, would be 
the venue’s primary source of revenue, 
providing an additional $240,000 per 
year in funding — or 45 percent of the 
Loft’s proposed budget.  

The Loft created a street team in 
an effort to attract support for the 
fee increase. According to street-team 
member Desi Kalcheva, this quarter’s 
project is to raise awareness of the 
referendum.

“We go to people to educate them 
on why we’re unique and need fund-
ing,” Kalcheva said.

The council will vote on referen-
dum specifics on Dec. 3.

Senior Vice Chancellor Retires After 25 Years

By Tanja Fijalkowski
Contributing Writer

Paul Drake announced his retire-
ment on Nov. 6, leaving his position of 
Senior Vice Chancellor of Academic 
Affairs after 25 years of service. 

Beginning his career at UCSD 
as a professor of political science, 
Drake became director of the Latin-
American studies program before 
being promoted to the position of 
dean of the division of social sciences 
in 1994. Drake served in the position 
for 12 years before being appointed to 
the position of vice chancellor in 2006.   

Drake said his goal as vice chancel-
lor was to preserve the academic core 
of the university, which he described 
as a fusion of world-class research and 
internationally renowned education.    

In 1998, Drake became a key 
member of the International Studies 
Advisory Committee, which created 
the international-studies department 
and the seven majors that fall under it. 
In 2004, as dean of social sciences, he 

granted a special allocation of $48,000 
to the preservation of the Heritage 
Language Program.  

Drake is concerned that the uni-
versity’s current budget constraints 
will negatively impact diversity efforts 
at UCSD. 

“Diversity has been a constant 
effort,” he said. “That’s been one of the 
disappointments of freezing over 100 
faculty positions. One of the ways to 
promote diversity is to bring in more 
faculties, which we can’t do right now.”  

Drake also established a fund-
raising campaign designed to create 
student scholarships, which received 
a $530,000 grant in the year 2000 
to support graduate students work-
ing in the social sciences. The grant 
was the single largest gift UCSD had 
yet received in its campaign to raise 
money for graduate support.  

The retiring vice chancellor has 
also been involved in efforts to make 
the new furlough program for faculty 
less onerous: He played an instrumen-
tal part in the creation of the Joint 
Senate-Administration Task Force on 
Budget Reconciliation.

Drake said he is concerned about 
the rate at which student fees are 
increasing.

“If the state reduces the amount of 

money by that much, who’s going to 
pay for the education?” he said. “We 
are unfortunately moving toward the 
model of a private university, where 
students pay the whole fare, and the 
state doesn’t pay for anything. But it’s 
the only way.”

Drake noted that the fee increases 
will most affect middle-class students, 
who will reserve less financial aid 
and will be expected to pay more in 
tuition.  

“I think that UCSD needs to figure 
out how to be great without relying on 
state funding,” he said. “We’re getting 
down to the bone here, and it’s going 
to hurt. But we have to get through 
this, and we have to move on. I think 
the notion of shared sacrifice is true. 
Everybody is suffering.”    

He expressed concerns about the 
university in the coming years.    

“I’m very worried about UCSD for 
the next year or so,” Drake said, “But 
I am optimistic in the long run. It will 
survive, and we will thrive.”   

Chancellor Marye Anne Fox has 
launched a national search to find a 
replacement for Drake, who will be 
leaving the university Oct. 1, 2010.

fees cover only a slice of the overall 
cost of education. The bottom line 
is that if we did not cap enrollment, 
we would end up diluting everyone’s 
education.”

The CSU system has 23 campuses 
across California. The system currently 
enrolls 450,000 students and employs 
48,000 faculty and staff. Last year, the 
university raised student fees by 30 
percent and implemented furloughs 
for nearly all campus employees. 

“The effect on students is huge,” 
Miles Nevin, executive director of the 
California Students Association, said. 
“What that does is decrease access to 
the system to qualified students, and 
that’s the bottom line. More impor-
tantly, while it’s going to have an 
immediate impact, the greater impact 
is that the CSU fuels the state’s econ-
omy, and when you’re not educating 
students to become police officers 
and nurses and engineers, we’re not 
going to be growing our economy.”

Cal State Northridge University 
senior Irene Darbinyan said she was 
disappointed to hear that fewer stu-
dents would have access to the CSU 
system.

“I believe that every applicant 
deserves an equal opportunity for 
enrollment,” Darbinyan said. “It is 
truly disappointing to see an increase 
of students seeking to create a better 
future for themselves be denied the 
benefits of attending a CSU.”

University officials stressed the 
importance of applying for admis-
sion by November 30, when about 
half of the system’s campuses will 
stop accepting applications for all 
freshmen and most transfer students. 
They also encouraged students to 
apply to the campus closest to their 
residential area, as preference is given 
to local applicants. 

Reed previewed the proposed 
2010-11 budget that the CSU Board 
of Trustees will vote on at its Nov. 
17 meeting. The budget will then go 
before Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 
and the state Legislature.

Labeled a “recover and reinvest” 
budget, the proposal requests that the

the Legislature to fund a projected

“This is a very ambitious budget

the true fiscal needs to run the CSU.”

Last Saturday night, while you and I were drinking away the pain of another sleep-
less school week, the House of 
Representatives was busy working 
out the nitty-gritty details of a bill 
that plans to overhaul our nation’s 
health-care system. The long-awaited 
bill passed by a slim margin of 220 to 
215 votes. Cue resounding applause, 
cheers and high-fives: victory at last. 

Except for one crucial detail. 

A few hours before the vote, an 
amendment that prohibits federal 
money from going toward insurance 
policies that cover abortions was 
tacked onto the bill — largely a result 
of pressure from the U.S. Conference 
of Catholic Bishops, who negotiated 
with top officials in House Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi’s office on Friday, and 
who made personal appeals to their 
congressmen and even President 
Barack Obama. 

Their resistance is rooted in the 
Catholic conviction that life begins at 
fertilization, and that ending a human 
life — even before birth — is morally 
wrong.

The bishops absurdly condemned 
the pre-amendment plan as an 
“accounting gimmick,” seeing as the 
bill as proposed would fund abortion-
covering insurers, but wouldn’t 
actually use tax dollars to pay for 
abortions. The group threatened to 
withdraw support for the legislation 
unless the bill included a stipulation 
that prohibited federal money from 
going to any insurance provider 
that covered abortion — “forcing” 
Democrats who needed an official 
OK from those pointy-hatted zealots 
to withdraw their support for the bill.

So much for separation of church 
and state.

The USCCB wields this ridiculous 
upper hand thanks to voting clout of 
68 million Catholics in the U.S., as 
well as the fervent political activism 
of its members — who are regularly 
in contact with lawmakers — upon 
whom they don’t hesitate to rain 
input. Recently, the group distributed 
fliers to every parish in the nation 
asking churchgoers to pray for abor-
tion restrictions and contact repre-
sentatives, encouraging them to push 
for bills in their favor. 

The amendment’s very real inclu-
sion transcends the often theoreti-
cal church-state separation debate. 
Should it become law, the measure 
would likely force insurers (87 
percent of which currently cover 
abortions) to drop abortions from 
their plans in order to meet the new 
health-care market.

The final bill reveals the discon-
certing influence our country’s reli-
gious leaders have over their govern-
ment. Bishops now have even more 
proof that they can be a dominating 
force in politics — a disturbing pros-
pect that threatens the separation of 
church and state.

So — despite considerable biparti-
san support — the USCCB’s heavy 
behind-the-scenes lobbying and 
grassroots organization left the bill 
tainted by religious doctrine. And 
suddenly, thanks to some influential

YELENA AKOPIAN

Raise your hand if you’re as burnt out on being angry about the impending student-
fee increases as we are. The picket 
signs, teach-ins, heartbreaking anec-
dotal forums, commissions on the 
future — all gallant efforts toward 
change — seem to be riling a stag-
nant sort of heat. Nobody can take 
another financial hit in this economy, 
and the UC Board of Regents has no 
goddamn idea what to do about it.

We’re trying our hardest to avoid 
a defeatist attitude, and, ultimately, 
we would like to commend the 
protestors. The Sept. 24 walkout, 
though conducted with a not-so-
community-building ruthlessness 
and somewhat meager turnout 
compared to Berkeley, was UCSD’s 
biggest rebel-rouser since the Prop. 8 
fiasco: a refreshing shot of outcry we 
could all care about. 

But it doesn’t come 
as much surprise that 
the walkouts ended 
there. Principally, 
we’re all students, not 
professional protes-
tors — even those 
designated to protest 

by student councils and orgs have an 
outside life to deal with. So, thank 
you for trying. It’s easy for ignorant, 
cynical passersby and newspaper 
shrews to dismiss a protest as too 
small to accomplish anything, but 

that’s the fault of those who weren’t 
out there, not those who made what-
ever push they could.

That said, the intention of student 
government systemwide to camp 
out at the Nov. 17 regents meet-
ing — where they will vote on a 
32-percent student-fee increase — is 
a waste of momentum. We need to 
choose a battle with at least some 
sliver of hope for victory. Despite 
any illusions of a “public comment 
period” the regents decided on this 
fee increase a long time ago. There is 
not a chance in hell they’ll compro-
mise the prestige of our university 
or make more faculty cuts to keep 
student fees low — especially know-
ing there will always be applicants 
too apathetic or uncaring to resist a 
heftier tuition bill (or resist handing 
it off to their parents).

Sure, the protests have been 
enough to scare UC President Mark 
G. Yudof into the depths of his office, 
spitting out lionhearted letters to 
avoid facing the pissed-off students 
and staff stomping around his cam-
puses. We also seem to have scared 
him into propping up a mighty fine 
financial-aid plan (though who 
knows, maybe that grand gesture 
flowed from the sheer kindness of 
his Blue and Gold heart). The fact 
that the UCSD financial aid depart-
ment has already sent 2009-10 
grant recipients its updated Winter 
Quarter allocations to accommo-
date the fee increase — a paranoid 
effort to qualm pre-decision fears or 
outrage — is a clear indication that 
the regents already have their minds 
made up.

It is indeed necessary to show 
the regents that there will always be 
a pack of watchdogs on their every 
move. But student leaders hold an 
even greater responsibility: to find 
ways of making a real change. It’s a 
much more daunting and unstable 
task — and requires breaking away 
from the standard march down 
Library Walk — but we’ve got to 
target the only real source of fund-
ing left in this devastating statewide 
crisis: Californians. Lord knows 
they’re all broke too, but taxes aren’t 
anywhere near a historical high. Not 

to mention they’re already funding 
a variety of causes less impactful 
(albeit noble) to the future of our 
state and nation.

What we really need, of course, 
is a constitutional convention to 
change our state’s voter-locked fund-
ing methods which make it virtually 
impossible for legislators to shave 
spare change off less-hurting tax 
recipients. Chances are, even our 
hard-jawed governor would find it in 
his heart to fund higher education if 
he had some more leg room to ration 
the bank account — and many other 
legislators have expressed a strong 

desire to 
support the 
University of 
California. 
With a 
slightly 
social-
ist move 
toward more 
government-
controlled 
tax revenue, 
it would 
just take a 
few simpler 
“marches on 
Sacramento” 

— as Yudof so heroically put it — to 
cure the rise in student fees. May’s 
statewide ballot measures, under 
the protection of 1B, attempted to 
preserve as much emergency funding 
for education as possible. In the end, 
it was California voters who trashed 
it. We need to make these voters see 
how important an affordable educa-
tion is to their personal and public 
future.

A.S. President Utsav Gupta has 
discussed a possible effort to lobby 
the San Diego community for its 
support of the UC cause. However, 
there are no signs of interest so far 
from his External Affairs counter-
parts in jumping on the initiative. If 
any of the A.S. budget or manpower 
was allotted to letting Californians 
know the dire situation we’re in, we 
might finally be making some head-
way in an affordable future, where it 
counts.

Non-UC-affiliated citizens hear 

the fringe noise of angry students 
and see Yudof ’s name in the news-
paper, but unless they have a child 
currently enrolled in the university 
or are themselves alumni, the public-
education plight is not necessarily 
at the top of their list of budgetary 
concerns. 

Here’s an idea: we band together 
to run a public information cam-
paign targeting voters. We ask them 
“Where would you be without your 
college education?” or “Where will 
your child/community be without 
the same?” and spread it statewide 
on mailbox flyers and public service 
announcements, asking Californians 
to bug their representatives in 
Sacramento, or just keep the cause 
in mind on a future ballot. Through 
these efforts we might come that 
much closer to convincing those who 
have the power to make a difference 
that access to public higher educa-
tion is worthy of their support.

Unfortunately, at this point, 
by targeting Yudof and the dead-
spirited regents, we’re attempting 
to beat down a bolted gate with an 
insufficient army. Maybe they’re just 
not being creative enough in the 
search for alternative funding — or 
are too wussy to try and push around 
the millions in graduate research — 
but the fact is, the leaders of the UC 
system have not found a solution to 
maintain the quality of the university 
without additional support from stu-
dent fees. So let’s stop complaining 
and find it ourselves.

OPINION� THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 2009� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 5 

Dear Editor,
I am writing this letter to address 

Cheryl Hori’s Nov. 2 article entitled 
“Slippery Ground”.

The bill — introduced by our 
State Senate Majority Leader 
Alberto Torrico — makes officials 
from the University of California 
and the California State University 
system think that resources for 
their schools would be reduced. 
However, the bill provides them 
with sufficient funding. 

Cutting state funding for higher 
education because higher education 
is funded by oil production is some-
thing that should concern UC and 
CSU officials. However, they need to 
look at the whole picture. The state of 
California is having a financial crisis, 
and it needs to find a way to stop that 
crisis. If the state cannot find a way 
to stop it, then it would be in deeper 
trouble than it already is — and so 
would the educational system, includ-
ing the UC system and CSU system. 
The officials from these systems need 
to understand how catastrophic the 
financial situation is for California 
and understand how this bill would 
help California as a whole. This bill, 
if passed, would be one way to allevi-
ate the state financial crisis if the state 
decides to cut state funding for higher 
education. This will prevent the state 
and the educational system from dys-
function.

I believe that this fear of cuts in 
state funding to higher education 
is unreasonable. Instead of blindly 
rejecting a bill that could hurt state 
funding for its schools, UC and CSU 
officials should look into the effect of 
this bill not only for their schools, but 
also for the whole state as well.

Dear Editor,
I consider it an achievement of 

America today that it is generally con-
sidered unacceptable to maliciously 
ridicule or intimidate an entire eth-
nicity in public. Expressing disgust 
for gays, on the other hand, is merely 
considered controversial. Though 
homophobic rhetoric may raise an 
eyebrow, it will rarely trigger anyone 
to object to the speaker’s message.

At RIMAC, while changing my 
clothes in the men’s locker room, I 
overheard a rowdy group of three to 
four guys in the aisle next to me. Their 
conversation went as follows:

Person 1: “ ... [Somebody] is a 
homo.”

Person 2: “Hey, what you got 
against gay people?” 

Person 1: “A lot!”
Malicious laughter ensued.
To these dear gentlemen: As per-

verted, aberrant and pansy you may 
think us to be, no — you still can’t 
use homophobic speech in public. 
Not in general society, and especially 
not at UCSD. If you replace the word 
“homo” with any racial epithet, I’m 
confident that even you would find it 
unacceptable to make that same joke.

pamphleteers, the health-care discus-
sion has morphed into an abortion 
debate. Ironic: What could be more 
pro-life than guaranteed health care?

Let’s get something straight: 
Abortion is a medical procedure to 
which every woman has the right. 
It is just as medically legitimate as 
heart surgery or cancer treatment. 
This fundamental reproductive right 
shouldn’t be trampled on by the 
moral teachings of the religious com-
munity.

On the other hand, I accept that 
abortion is a polarizing national issue 
— a recent poll by the Pew Research 
Group reported that only 45 percent 
of Americans said abortion should 

even be legal  — so I admit that it 
probably shouldn’t be funded by our 
tax dollars.

But the amendment goes much 
further than to just ensure federal 
money won’t pay for abortions — 
which doesn’t happen currently 
anyway (and wouldn’t have, were the 
amendment not hastily slapped on 
the bill). By limiting the availability 
of a medical procedure 1.3 million 
American women need every year, 
the bill would deal the biggest blow 
to abortion since partial-birth abor-
tions were outlawed in 2003. Angry 
Democrats held their noses and 
voted in favor of the bill anyway, 
arguing that passing the bill would 
give them an opportunity to hash 

out the details on the Senate floor 
later.

Diffusing the issue for now may 
have allowed the bill to get past the 
House, but with a Democratic major-
ity in both houses of Congress for 
the first time in 12 years, it’s time 
Democrats stop cowering at religious 
leaders’ bullying and take a firm 
stand in favor of abortion rights.

Yes, this legislation is historic. Yes, 
it’s a monumental victory in a long 
battle toward universal health care. 
But at the end of the day, in a coun-
try that seems to be slowly turning its 
back on a woman’s right to choose, 
it’s just as important to make sure we 
don’t lose that battle in the future just 
to win the health-care war today.

I ’m having a really hard time per-suading people like you that I’m a genius. It’s surprising how much 
effort it takes to convince people of 
something so obvious. But I think I’ve 
finally found a way. It’s gonna take 
some time, a little investment and a lit-
tle trust, but it’s the only sure-fire way 
to get you to believe. All I need is for 
you to keep in mind that, in the sum-
mer of 2010, Scott Pilgrim is gonna be 
a big fucking deal. And when this hap-
pens, just remember: I called it first.

So what is Scott Pilgrim, and why 

does it matter so much? Let’s see. To 
begin, Scott Pilgrim is the greatest 
fucking thing to happen to comics and 
print media for many, many years. The 
last time such an overwhelming phe-
nomenon enveloped our tiny lives was 
when X-Men hit the big screen and 
Watchmen made it to Time Magazine’s 
list of the 100 best novels of all time.

But don’t make the mistake of 
believing Scott Pilgrim has some lofty 
philosophical or existential meaning. 
It’s more like the embodiment of our 
generation — ours being the young 
twentysomethings raised on Mario, 
Pokemon and Nintendo with both a 
lust and fear for life, aimlessly search-
ing for purpose and direction without 
an inkling of what it might be. This 
comic is made for us, by us, to speak 
for us. It’s the closest thing we will ever 
have to an all-encompassing identity.

OK, so I’m being a bit hyperbolic, 
but I maintain that Pilgrim is repre-
sentative of our generation (at least 
in terms of alternative pop culture). 
The comic depicts everyday problems 
without sacrificing any of the cultural 
memes it’s wrapped in. For instance, 
what would you do before meeting an 
ex? You save at a save point! Or, what’s 
the one thing stopping you from enter-
ing someone’s heart? The password!

You can look at everything objec-
tively and disregard your dilemmas 
as the mere stuff of whining, but, in 
actuality, your problems are much 
more severe than anyone else’s. The 
real trouble in life is emotional bag-

FILMREVIEW

By Jenna Brogan
Associate Hiatus Editor

H ow long does it take to destroy the world?  According to director 
Roland Emmerich, a yawn-
inducing two hours and 40 
minutes.  That’s right: The brave 
soul who stamped his name on 
“Independence Day” and “The 
Day After Tomorrow” is back to 
cleanse the planet all over again 
— this time, with $250 million 
worth of gleaming vengeance.  

While it’s clear that the lump 
sum went in to some outrageous 
special effects — including 
the collapse of the Vatican, a 
squashed White House and hun-
dreds of crumbling skyscrapers 
that all too closely resemble 
the Twin 
Towers — 

it’s also clear that very little was 
spent on the feeble cause of a 
casting call or halfway-decent 
screenwriter.

Within the first few min-
utes, we meet Adrian (Chiwetel 
Ejiofor), a paranoid geologist 
who has uncovered what he 
believes to be the first sign of the 
end of the world. Get ready for a 
solid slew of panicked “My God! 
I thought we’d have more time!” 
cries, and — of course — the 
unforgettable “This is a suicide 
mission!”  

After some more ingenious 
one-liners and a mouthful of 
indecipherable pseudo-scien-
tific mumbo jumbo, we come 
to a shaky semi-understanding 
that the earth is going to shit 
because of something called 

“crust dis-
placement,” 

which somehow correlates with 
the Mayan doomsday predic-
tion for December 21, 2012.  

While Adrian breaks the 
news to the U.S. president 
(Danny Glover), we are intro-
duced to Jackson (a brooding 
John Cusack), failed author 
and father whose struggle to 
reconnect with his eternally 
disappointed children is drawn 
out painfully to the end credits.  
With a nagging ex (Amanda 
Peet) ready to nail him for his 
inadequacies and her new man 
for competition, the last thing 
Jackson needs is a cataclysmic 
emergency to worry about — but 
Cusack has never been too lucky.  

It’s not long before earth-
quakes spider-web the nation, 
and civilization as we know it

like, and are they worth your $5? 
Imagine the Cure and Joy Division 
frolicking in the summer sun (as 
best ’80s mopers can), starring in 
their very own campy ’50s beach-
party movie montage. Standout 
cut “Let’s Go Surfing” maintains a 
dark double-speed bassline with 
syncopated whistling and hand-
claps, reveling in its catchiness. It’s 
an artfully constructed machine 
designed for insta-pleasure, and 
will make for a sweat-soaked live 
set. On the more morose end of 
the spectrum, however, EP-ender 

“Down by the Water” pairs 
Jonathan Pierce’s “If  they stop  
loving you/ I won’t stop loving 
you” croons with uncanny bass 
murmurs and splash-reverb beats. 

So if you’re looking for some 
honed post-punk this Sunday, 
you’re guaranteed a quality (if 
abbreviated) show with poten-
tial surprises — namely, some 
unheard cuts expected for the 
LP and hype-worthy live energy. 
Who knows? Their endless out-
bursts of sun and sadness could 
be the perfect recipe for UCSD.     

Guardian: Besides your most noticeable 
influences, what weird or obscure bands 
are you guys really into? Any super popu-
lar songs from this year that you loved?
Drums: I’m not sure which are the more 
noticeable ones. We’re into a lot of bands 
from Scotland (the Orchids, Orange 
Juice). Also, a lot of great bands from the 
Northwest or early ’90s in general (Cool 
Rays, Mission of Burma). Songs from this 
year? “Tonight,” by the Smith Westerns.

was “Obama/ I wanna go surfing/ Obama/ I don’t 
care about nothing,” but you’re really singing, “Oh 
Mama.” I guess I wanted to hear your opinion on 
how important lyrical content is with your music, 
whether you invite interpretation or you want to 
be more straightforward. I almost wanted it to be 
“Obama.” Like he would care if you went surfing.
D: Well, pop music has a tradition of being more 
straightforward with everything. It’s more about 
giving to the listener. Nothing “clever” or tricky.

G: What’s the worst music 
and fashion trend you’ve 
noticed since you moved 
back to Brooklyn?
D: Lady Gaga.
G: It seems so many bands 
are coming out of there, it’s 
hard to keep track. But you 
guys have gotten attention 
in a really short amount of 
time. What was the music 
scene like in Florida that 
convinced you to move 
back to New York?
D: There was no music 
scene there. Or rather, 

we were so disconnected from everything at that 
point, we weren’t aware of one. It was the lack of 
music there that brought us here.
G: You’ve managed to tour internationally from 
one EP, Summertime!, playing a show in Iceland 
and a handful in England. What was Iceland like, 
and how’d you get that opportunity? Did you get 
much time to explore Reykjavik?
D: Iceland was great. We laughed a lot. It’s a 
beautiful place, despite all the rain. Everything in 
Reykjavik looks stunning, and the kids that go to 
shows give everything to a performance that they 
like. I’m not sure it even matters who it is, as long 
as that specific performance does something for 
them.  
G: You’re playing a few more shows in California 
after the Loft date, but what’s the next step for the 
Drums? How is progress on the first album, and 
when can we expect to hear it?
D: We are looking to release the album early next 
year. It’s essentially all done; written and recorded. 
We have some loose ends to tie up but we’re excit-
ed to release it. We’re set to tour, globally, through 
the fall of next year.

I f Mommy and Daddy cursed you and your sibling with cute-as-a-button names like Apple or Moses, all bets are on the table 
that you are either the unfortunate offspring 
of Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin or the 
butt end of a sick, sick joke. In the UCSD 
theater department’s adaptation of Pulitzer 
Prize-winning “Topdog/ Underdog,” brothers 
Lincoln and Booth can empathize. The aban-
doned, 30-something-year-old children of phi-
landering parents, Lincoln and Booth are black 
men in white America. One works as a Lincoln 
impersonator (white face/top hat) at an arcade, 
while the other aspires to be a street hustler. As 
they struggle with racism, poverty and the fair-
er sex, the motif of a three-card monte reveals 
the brothers’ illusions of personal identity.

“Lean in close and watch me close, watch 
me close now,” Booth repeats while practicing 
his card trick. With this invitation, playwright 
Suzan-Lori Parks coaxes us to challenge the 

play’s face value. “Topdog” pities a fractured 
African-American family living in a dilapidat-
ed inner-city apartment with dreams deferred 
(insert ninth-grade “A Raisin in the Sun” essay 
here). But the race card nearly disappears as 
Lincoln and Booth pick up the game of cards, 
and their sibling rivalry rises to the forefront. 
So much that — though a pre-show “Enjoy the 
mothafuckin’ show, mothafuckers” promises 
comedic relief — embroiled argumentation 
over mesmerizing rounds of three-card monte 
has wrung the audience’s capacity for attentive-
ness dead dry by the three-hour mark. 

After a near-death shooting, Lincoln leaves 
the trade to impersonate Honest Abe for a liv-
ing: He lets tourists aim phony pistols at his 
head while he “makes up songs, makes plans.” 
Booth, meanwhile, takes hustling up as a get-
rich-quick scheme for impressing his lover, 
Grace. Her symbolic absence throughout the 
play foreshadows the absolution that Lincoln 
and Booth will ultimately face.

When Booth finally gives in, we root 
for him. After all, con man is surely a step 
up from department-store thief. But when 
Lincoln loses his job to a wax dummy, he 
finds himself drawn back into the thug life. 
Booth instantly adopts a competitive hostil-
ity toward his elder brother, vying to topple 

Lincoln from his “topdog” pedestal.
A single bed, sofa and makeshift crate ‘n’ 

cardboard dining table cramp the already close 
quarters of the Arthur Wagner Theatre, and 
the suffocation created by this compact set 
mirrors the ballooning egos of the brothers. 
Bouquets of bare light bulbs hang upside down 
from the ceiling to aggrandize the brothers’ 
financial woes, and their soft glow — under 
the set design of Sarah Cogan — opens space 
for familial love despite the bickering.

 In a play that leans heavily on the acting 
chops of its two-man cast, both Johnny Gill 
and Bowman Wright depict characters so 
divergent in personality that when Lincoln 
questions, “Is we really blood brothers?” it 
seems plausible. As Booth, Gill oscillates grace-
fully from the pelvic-thrusting highs of “sexual 
release” down to the tear-jerking lows of the 
demoralizing final scene. Wright’s Lincoln is an 
equally nuanced performance, rife with mono-
tone rhyme-bustin’ and repressed anger, which 
provides a direct foil for Booth’s unrestraint. 

As Lincoln and Booth bash and thrash each 
other, they initiate a cycle in which, ultimately, 
the winner is unclear. Under the direction of 
Nadine George-Graves, however, this produc-
tion certainly emerges a dog on top. So watch 
it. And watch it close now.

literally falls through the 
cracks. (Cue homeless man 
holding “Repent, the end is 
near” sign.) 

Woody Harrelson, as 
the archetypal googly-
eyed hippie who knew 
it all along, forewarns 
Jackson about his family’s 
impending doom if they 
fail to secure a spot on a 
government-funded Noah’s 

Ark operation: three mas-
sive zeppelin-looking ships 
designed to carry the feds 
(and the rich) to safety.  

Oops! Did I give away 
too much? Oh well. After 
a side-glance at the trailer, 
you can guess this film’s 
not exactly groundbreak-
ing — no pun intended 
— given the soaring rates 
of second-string actors and 
explosions.

Like any other apoca-
lypse narrative, you’ve 
got the quintessential 
father-son sap, the crazed 
scientist with the answers, 
the average Joe who just 
happens to know how to 
fly a plane, the limo that 
can hop crevices, the hand 
that clutches the edge of 
the cliff just in time, the 
dramatic “West Wing” 
DC shots, and the human 

race bowing in prayer as a 
tsunami engulfs the land. 
Essentially, Emmerich’s 
latest is a compilation of 
every high-grossing disas-
ter movie you’ve ever seen.

But hey, if think you 
can handle dude saying, “I 
feel like something is pull-
ing us apart” to his girl-
friend just as the ground 
splits at their feet, all the 
power to you.   

gage, which is precisely where the 
comic excels. Scott Pilgrim and 
Ramona Flowers’ seven evil ex-boy-
friends might be the best metaphor for 
relationships and emotional baggage 
that I’ve ever seen, heard or read in 
any print media. Aside from the fact 
that it brilliantly compares every arc 
of a relationship to a trial in a video 
game, it begs the question: What 
happens after you defeat the final ex-
boyfriend? What happens when there’s 
no one left to fight anymore? Do you 
yourself become the evil ex-boyfriend?

Obviously, it’s a lot more compli-
cated than that, and the genius of the 
comic lies in its exploration of these 
messy dynamics. All the characters in 
the story — and their conflicts, their 
passions, their hopes, their fears, etc. 
— are things we can irrefutably relate 
to. If you have it in you to accuse a 
character of being an asshole, then 
you’ve probably been one as well.

I can go on about how one char-
acter represents naive angst or how 
another represents transitional aban-
donment — there’s so much to dissect. 
And I realize that all I’m really doing 
is saying how awesome it is, over and 
over. But when the movie adaptation 
comes out next summer, you’re gonna 
want to know why it’s so awesome. 
And then, when you read the comic, 
you’ll understand. I don’t want you to 
be like everyone else, just following 
some trend. I want you to laugh like 
you’re in on a secret. So find Scott 
Pilgrim, and read it. Before it’s too late.

C lassic rock fans, rejoice: Your dream film is here. As for every-body else, well, you better start 
enjoying flower power and sticking it 
to the man right about now.

But take heed, because nothing 
in “Pirate Radio” is taken seriously. 
Considering the plot is driven by 
nothing more than sheer ridiculous-
ness, it’s hard to believe that the film 
was inspired by true-to-life historical 
events. 

The latest from director Richard 
Curtis (taking a far leap from “Love 

Actually”), “Radio” is a wack-o take 
on the heyday of pirate radio sta-
tions — a phenomenon inspired by 
the British government’s censorship of 
rock ‘n’ roll in the 1960s. In this case, 
a group of renegade deejays band 
together on an old ship anchored in 
the North Sea to broadcast popular 
hits from such subverseive rebels 
as the Who, Jimi Hendrix and the 
Rolling Stones, to name a few. 

In addition to an inevitably kick-
ass soundtrack, the film’s small char-
ma lie in its slew of over-the-top char-
acters. Though they’re all probably 
smashed, the actors seem to be having 
so much fun trying to outdo each oth-
er’s personas that it’s impossible not to 
get sucked into the shitshow. Dueling 
deejays Gavin (Rhys Ifans) and the 
Count (Philip Seymour Hoffman) are 
particularly fun to watch, each lost 
in his own idiosyncrasies as the pair 
cavort around the ship like the rock-
stars they idolize. 

Though the ’60s decadence, 

discography and dance provide an 
addictive time capsule for all those 
babies of baby boomers who spend 
the better part of life wishing they 
hadn’t missed out on Woodstock and 
JFK, the film’s sloppy script often 
compromises its flow. 

In a particularly jolting moment of 
self-awareness, the Count proclaims, 
“These are the best years of our lives.” 
While that may be true, the line feels 
so out of place within the deejay’s “I 
don’t give a fuck” anthem that we’re 
bound to wonder what Curtis was 
smoking when he wrote it — and 
where we can get some.

Though the maritime station 
broadcasts for several years without 
reprimand, the evil government even-
tually finds a way to stop the music. 
(Sorry, Rihanna.) But, like true pirates, 
the DJs fight the law out of loyalty to 
their fans, and adopt a broadcast-or-
die attitude. Or go to prison, of course.

Despite a sparse plot, there is still 
plenty of space for humor, and the 
actors are chock full of it. But when 
Curtis falls back on cheap slapstick 
rather than allowing the talent to 
unfold, the close confines of the ship 
begin to suffocate everyone involved. 

At times, “Radio” seems a missed 
opportunity for depth in the story of 
Carl (Tom Sturridge) — a wide-eyed 
18-year-old who comes of age aboard 
the ship, “Almost Famous” style — 
more than anything. Without even a 
drop of emotional fanfare, an awk-
ward gap is left in the narrative. But 
if you’re only in it for a head-banging 
good time, this one’s for you.

FILMREVIEW

ALBUMREVIEW

I s it just me, or does Dashboard Confessional make nothing but breakup albums?
Emo songsmith Chris Carrabba 

has always been sentimental, but 
Alter the Ending takes it one step 
further for a never-ending lament of 
relationships gone bad, with a track 
for every new and bitter ending 
imaginable.

Lead single “Belle of the 
Boulevard” tries for clever and sweet-
cheeked, but fails miserably at the 
tear-jerking sentiment it tries far too 
hard to evoke. The best Confessional 
can offer us is the brilliant realization 
that “life is always hard,” contrived 
loveliness dribbling from a soft gui-
tar, one incessant piano chord and 
whispery backup that grows laugh-
ably earnest at the chorus. Falling 
far short of the lost-love ballad it so 
badly wants to be, it’s becomes anoth-
er one of those weepy tunes you 
listen to out of obligation once (and 
only once) after a breakup with the 
not-so-special someone you didn’t 
like that much to begin with. 

If “Boulevard” was for the one 
you’re glad is gone, “Get Me Right” is 
for the one that got away: the break-
up that was completely your fault, 
that you can’t stop beating yourself 
up over. There’s nothing like an oddly 

pretty, repetitive melody combined 
with breathy, hurting lyrics alluding 
to Jesus and sinners to make self-
crucifixion all the more satisfying. It’s 
one of Ending’s few solid cuts, show-
ing off a little virtuoso on the ’ments 
and the striking melody of Carrabba 
singing “ri-i-i-ght” with surprising 
vocal range.

“I Know About You” is a jaunty 
stalker anthem to soundtrack the vin-
dication of having known all along 
your significant other was cheating. 
Carrabba’s hyperactive pace makes 
the song catchy and nearly happy — 
until you listen to the lyrics and real-
ize it’s just a bummer testament to all 
those fellow paranoid exes out there. 

Just to throw us for a loop, the 
album’s title track tells of a relation-
ship that can “still go on,” even if 
Carrabba can’t resist throwing in the 
pessimistic prediction that the worst 
is still to come. But don’t worry: 
This optimistic slip-up is balanced 
by plenty of other faux tragedies for 
the perfect pity party for you, Ben 
& Jerry and Dashboard. “Alter the 
Ending” is just a faint, dismissable 
glimmer of hope in a cesspool of 
pseudo-despair, just right for the 
dwelling.

SPORTS� THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 2009� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 11 

utility Lance Curtiss and netting a goal 
from the two-meter mark. 

After the teams exchanged goals, 
the Broncos took advantage of a lucky 
deflection, extending their advantage 
to 5-3 with 3:59 left in the half. Santa 
Clara University found the goal again 
with just under a minute until half-
time, extending the Broncos’ lead to a 
game-high three scores. 

However, after some quick ball 
movement from the Tritons, Curtiss 
sank the ball into the corner of the cage 
to bring the score to 6-4.

UCSD charged out with renewed 
energy in the third quarter: Junior 
driver Bryce Madsen used an assist 
from Curtiss to lob the ball cross-cage 
on the Tritons’ first possession, cut-
ting Santa Clara University’s lead to 
one goal. 

The game remained close through-
out the quarter, both teams match-
ing each other goal for goal. With a 
10-9 Bronco advantage and less than 
one minute to play in the third quar-
ter, senior two-meter defender Peter 
Gresham skipped a shot into the goal 
to tie the match at 10-10.

In addition to his score, Gresham’s 
defense played a key role in the 
Tritons’ success in the match’s second 
half.

“We changed to a helping-style 
defense at halftime, which proved to 
be a significant change,” Harper said. 

“It was a different ballgame after that. 
There was a lot more outside shooting. 
In the first half, Santa Clara’s two-
meter men got the best of us. But 
in the second half, Peter 
Gresham outplayed them. 
The kid never gets down 
— he’s so positive.”

The Tritons wasted 
little time getting on the 
board in the final period 
of regulation. Following 
a Santa Clara University 
kickout on UCSD’s coun-
terattack, Harper called 
a timeout to give the 
Tritons a full 6-on-5 pos-
session. 

Once again, Gresham 
came up big, scoring 
from the post after a per-
fectly placed pass from 
junior driver Sean Cruz. 
With 6:58 on the clock, 
UCSD got its first lead.

The Broncos stormed back, how-
ever, scoring three straight goals over 
a period of four minutes, taking a 
13-11 advantage with 2:33 left in the 
game. 

With just over a minute left, as the 
Tritons’ hopes of victory dwindled, 
Donohoe took advantage of a man-
up situation to net a close shot from 
directly in front of the goal.

Still one goal behind, Donohoe 
once again found himself with the 

ball on a Triton counterattack, and 
passed to a teammate who was hold-
ing position in front of the cage. 
The ref blew the whistle and held up 

five fingers —indicating a 
UCSD penalty shot. 

Donohoe sank the five-
meter shot into the lower 
corner to send the game 
into overtime. 

With renewed momen-
tum, Madsen scored half-
way through the first five-
minute overtime period on 
a thrilling Triton six-on-
five opportunity, handing 
his team the victory.

“Obviously, the team 
was very resilient,” Harper 
said. “It was a tough ball-
game against a very good 
team, and we had to 
scramble to pull that one 
out. It was a great come-
back, and I’m so thrilled for 

our six seniors. And we’re undefeated 
at home this year, because this is our 
real home.”

UCSD will play two exhibition 
games at Canyonview on Nov. 14  —
against Sunset and the San Francisco 
Olympic Club — as they wait for word 
on their postseason seeding for the 
WWPA Championships.

“Fall races are always a challenge 
for us, because with the quarter sys-
tem, we start about a month after USD 
and SDSU,” Pinkerton said. “They do, 
however, give us an opportunity to 
assess the competition and give us a 
benchmark. We know what we will 
have to do in the spring. If we want to 
be competitive on a national level, we 
have to bring the race to our local D-I 
programs.”

UCSD’s other boats also battled to 
the finish, but came up slightly short 
against their competitors. The Tritons’ 
varsity four-boat placed fourth in 
its race against the University of 
San Diego with a time of 24:13. The 

Toreros’ A-boat bested the Tritons by 
four minutes, coming in first at 20:38. 

In the novice eight-boat event, 
UCSD finished behind San Diego 
State University and the University of 
San Diego, earning times of 27:56 and 
28:27, respectively.  

According to Pinkerton, fall regat-
tas such as the San Diego Fall Classic 
allow the Tritons to better assemble 
the team. 

“We are working to incorporate 
our incoming freshmen, our return-
ing novice rowers and the returning 
varsity,” Pinkerton said. “They are all 
on slightly different points in their 
technical expertise. In the fall, we have 
the opportunity to focus on making 

technical improvements that can have 
profound effects on our speed in the 
spring. I’ve been deeply impressed by 
the focus of this year’s team.”

The Tritons, who are back in action  
on Sat., Nov. 14 for the UCSD College 
Challenge, are looking to build upon 
their solid opening performance. 
The inter-squad regatta will give the 
Tritons one last chance to finetune 
before the spring season. 

The event is slated for 7 a.m. at 
Mission Bay, and will conclude the 
fall schedule for the UCSD women’s 
crew team.

team’s regional performance.
“We had some really good group-

ing, with our three top runners all 
running together,” Garcia said. “We 
had emphasized the idea of showing 
heart, and I feel like the men’s team did 
that. I saw them fight for every inch of 
that 10K.”

Conference rival Chico State won 
the meet on the men’s side by plac-
ing all five of their scoring runners in 
the race’s top 20. Alaska Anchorage’s 
Marko Chesto won the men’s race with 
a time 30:42. Western Washington and 

Alaska Anchorage also qualified for 
the national championships on the 
men’s side. All seven of the teams that 
advanced were ranked in the top 25 
nationally.

After a slow start in the meet, senior 
Mike Wright picked up the pace and 
motivated his fellow Tritons to join 
him in one final push for the season.

“We were somewhat scattered 
when we first started, and our senior 
Mike brought us together in a tight 
group,” Baum said. “It really showed 
leadership on his part.”

The Triton men came into the 

meet ranked 10th in the region, but 
came away in ninth place overall — an 
improvement they hope to build on 
next year.

“To make that step is something 
we were pleased with,” Garcia said. 
“Stanislaus had a strong one-two 
punch for their top runners and that 
was difficult to deal with, but at the end 
of the day, going from 10th to ninth 
is something you have to be pleased 
with.”

SEASON LOST IN SAN FRANCISCO FOG

By Liam Rose
Staff Writer

CROSS COUNTRY — Despite a strong per-
formance on Nov. 7 at the NCAA Division-
II West Regional Championships, the UCSD 
cross-country team closed its season sooner 
than expected. 

The Tritons travelled to Golden Gate Park 
in San Francisco, Calif., to compete against 
25 teams from across the state. The women’s 
team finished seventh while the men’s team 
took ninth. The race means a disappointing 
early end to the season, as both squads failed 
to qualify for the NCAA Division-II National 

Championships. 
The Tritons showed several outstanding 

individual performances, beginning with junior 
Bre Schofield’s 18th-place finish. Schofield’s time 
of 21:52 in the 6K course was only 18 seconds 
behind conference champion Vivien Wadeck of 
Cal State Los Angeles, making her the Tritons’ 
top overall finisher of the day. Sophomore Elena 
Inouye finished 37th overall with a time of 
22:52, besting her 51st-place finish at last year’s 
regional meet. Senior Marie Schaper, soph-
omore Aaryn Kobayashi and junior Brianna 
Alban also finished strong for the team.

“The women raced well, but we just weren’t 
as fast as some of those elite squads out there,” 
head coach Nate Garcia said. “But I have to 
appreciate the effort I saw out there, even when 
it wasn’t going the way we wanted.”

Three of the top five individual women 
finishers were from the University of Alaska 
Anchorage’s champion team, which narrow-
ly edged out California Collegiate Athletic 

Association champion Chico State. 
Western Washington University and Seattle 

Pacific University joined Alaska Anchorage and 
Chico State as qualifiers for the national cham-
pionships, which will take place on Nov. 21 in 
Evansville, Ind. Jessica Pixler of Seattle Pacific 
broke the tape with a first-place time of 20:08 
— over 30 seconds faster than the second-place 
runner.

On the men’s side, sophomore Jeremy Riley 
led the way for the Tritons with a time of 32:58 
in the 10K, which earned him a 35th-place fin-
ish. Senior Mike Wright followed close behind 
in 43rd, coming in at 33:26. Sophomores Alex 
Corliss and John Svet and junior Eric Baum 
rounded out the scoring for UCSD’s men — all 
making their first career appearances at the 
regional meet. 

Despite a disappointing final score, Garcia 
said he saw many positive developments in his 

A disappointing performance 
at regionals cut the 2009 season 
short; no Tritons will run in the 
NCAA National Championship.

The women’s cross-country team took seventh place at the 2009 West Regional Championships held in San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park. The men finished 
ninth overall. No individual runner placed better than 18th, meaning that UCSD will not send a representative to the NCAA National Championships.

WOMEN’s CREW — The varsity 
eight boat opened up its rowing sea-
son with a second-place finish at 
the San Diego Fall Classic, held at 
Mission Bay on Nov. 8. The Tritons 
raced local rivals and Division-I 
teams San Diego State University and 
the University of San Diego at the 
event, crossing the finish line at 22:41 
just behind the first-place Aztecs, 
who turned in a time of 19:47. 

UCSD’s lineup for the Fall Classic 
consisted of sophomore Lisa Yen at 
coxswain, senior Jesi Bennett at stroke  
with seniors Wanda Chin, Summer 
Austin and Jamie Bigwood; juniors 
Denise Kleckner, Courtney Escajeda  
and Lynn Nguyen and sophomore 
Brigitte Ngo-Trinh rounding out the  
Triton eight boat.

Starting the season with just three 
returnees from last year’s varsity 
eight, the Tritons’ performance at the 
San Diego Fall Classic was a good 
sign for the team’s upcoming meets.

“Our team is often smaller than 
the competition, and our goal is 
to outrow them by being a better 
team and training smarter,” head 
coach Pattie Pinkerton said. “This 
year’s varsity is working very hard 
at improving, and we are seeing the 
results on the water. We’ll see the real 
benefit in the spring when they are 
more confident with the changes.”

Crew has both a fall and spring 
season on the quarter system, which 
has both drawbacks and advantages 
for the coaches and players.

MEN’S WATER POLO — Playing 
their first game in Canyonview pool 
since early September, the No. 11 
Tritons closed out their regular season 
with an afternoon to remember. 

Facing off against No. 14 Santa 
Clara University, UCSD junior driver 
Bryce Madsen scored an overtime goal 
to earn an exciting come-from-behind 
14-13 victory on Nov. 7. 

“It’s a pretty gray day today, but to 
me, it feels like it’s shining,” head coach 
Denny Harper said after the game. 

As the final regular-season game 
before the Tritons head to the Western 
Water-Polo Championships from Nov. 
20 to Nov. 22, the win may play as a 
key factor in seed determinations for 
the playoffs. 

“The game definitely had confer-
ence implications,” Harper said. “Had 
we lost, there would have been an 
argument for us to be the No. 4 seed. 
Now, we should be No. 2 — and that’s 
a big difference there. No one wants to 
play in the [No. 4 vs. No. 5] game to 
start the tournament.”

Following a short ceremony honor-
ing UCSD’s six seniors, the game got 
underway and the Tritons quickly fell 
behind. Failing to score in the first 
period, the team found itself in a 2-0 
hole by the start of the second period. 

Senior two-meter defender Steven 
Donohoe put UCSD on the board 
early, taking a pass from sophomore 

Despite losing in the first round of the CCAA conference 
playoffs, the UCSD women’s soccer team will host the 2009 
NCAA West Regionals. The Tritons — whose 14-5-1 record 
earned them a first round bye — will play the winner of 
Nov. 12’s Seattle Pacific vs. Chico State match. UCSD has 
faced defending national champion Seattle Pacific three 
times in the postseason, most recently falling 3-1 in the 
2008 regionals. After having played each other twice in the 
CCAA playoffs, UCSD and Chico State would meet in the 
NCAA postseason for the first time. The Tritons — who have 
qualified for the NCAA Tournament 23 out of the last 24 
years — look to earn a spot in the national championship 
game for the first time since winning back-to-back national 
titles from 2000 to 2001.
