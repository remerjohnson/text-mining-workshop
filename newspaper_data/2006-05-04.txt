UC Team Invents 
'Dragonfly Eye' 

A team of bioengineers from 
UC Berkeley has developed a 
ser ies of compound a rtificia l eyes 
using houseflies and dragonflies 
as models. 

TI,e eyes will eventua lly be 
modified to act as cameras or sen-
sory detectors, with powntial uses 

including surveillance, high-speed 
motion detection, environmental 
sensing and medical procedures. 
According to bioengineer Luke P. 
Lee, the invention marks the first 
integration of thousands of micro-
lenses, a II orie nted at different 
angles, with conducting channels 
created by beams of light. 

The team predicts that the eYes 
will be built into ultra-thin camera 
phones within a few years. The 
eyes could also be formatted into 
camcorders for multidirection SUT-
ve illance and for use as discreet, 
wearable cameras. 

Weight Misjudgement 
Common In Latinos 
Latino mothers frequently have 

e rroneous perceptions of the body 
weight appropriate for preschool-
aged children, according to a new 
study from UC San Francisco. 

Latinos most commonly identi-
fied the ir children as hea lthy whe n 
in reali ty they we re overwe ight. 
The study used resu Its from a 
series of surveys o f Latino wornen 
and c hildren conduc ted between 
2000 and 2003. The number of 
obese children was high among 
women who had no concerns 
about the ir childre n's health or 
report(.>d that their kids w(.'re eat-
ing well. 

Pediatric ian Ele na Fuentes-
Affl ic k conduc ted the study 
because of rising occurrences of 
childhood obesity in the United 
States. In the study, children were 
identified as overweight if their 
weights were at or above the 
85th percentile on developmental 
growth charts.

A t first, events of the May 3 A.S. Council meeting gave every indication that the

returned to a comfortable synthesis 
of the emotions that have marked 
this particular coum;iI's now-com-

prehenSibly fast monologue, only 
Slopping occasionally for breath and 
laughter. 

FoUowing some serious busi-

"Let's get off that high horse for 
a minute, OK?" former President 
ChriltOpller SWeeten shot back. 
"This has to get paid. So if we can 
just pass this. that would be great." 

'The council ultimately passed 
the bill as the majority of the sen-
ators sided with a slightly more 
diplomatic former Vice President

explained that this mistake was one 
of many she was left to deal with 
after her predece56Ol"S resignation.

LETTERS TO 
THE EDITOR 
Students Should Voice 
Opinions on Parking 

Dear Editor: 
I agree with many of the com-

ments made in "Waking Up from the 
P-.u-king Nightmare" in the May 1 issue. 
However, understanding the whole 
issue would help with future discus-
sion from .students. Nathan Mildos hit 
the crucial point about Transportation 
& Parking Services: It's self-suffICient, 
and therefore must run like a business 
and not necessarily a student service. 
Increasing the number or frequen-
cy of Cityshuttles. for example. is an 
extremely expensive venture, the cost 
of which would be covered by current 
permit b~ra. This wou1d inevitably 
lead to ~ in permit costs for 
students. staff and faculty, which is 
already set to occur ~ year fOr the 
next few years. Also, as the ridership 
goes up for the free service, the rev-
enue generated by permits goes down. 
This is not a good balance to the sup-
ply and demand equation, especially 
since debt ~rvice will increase over 
the next 10 years to cover the new 
parking structures and the changing 
of shuttle buses to environmentally 
friendly vehicles. 

The two-tiered system is an option, 
the logistics of which have bem dis-
cussed in past Transportation Policy 
Committee mec:tings. It will be inter-
esting to see how many commuters 
switch to the cheaper permit, sacrific-
ing 15 minutes of convenience for sav-
ings off the original cost. The system 
currently provided by UCLA offers 
permits to commuters for $S 13 per 
year and residents for S630 per year. 
Should we adopt the same system and 
charge differently between students 
who live OIl campus and those who live 
off? Which lots would we designate as 
commuter and resident? Should stu-
dents be charged to use the Citysbuttle 
so that permit buyers don't haw to 

co~ the cost of this service? 
These questions I have voiced to the 

committee, and I will continue until 
solutions are implemented. What other 
students can do is send in their own 
comments. T&PS doesn't get much 
input or feedback from students, e\'aI 
though parking issues are 50rrIe of the 
top issues on campus. Contact Greg 
Snee (director of planning and analysis 
for T&PS) or myself (jmMti1lO@ucsd. 
cdu) if you have ideas, because I think 
student input is a powerful tool that 
has been underutilized regarding this 
issue.

'M:I-3' Will 
In Two H·ours 

man i bound to a chair while he is forced 
to watch his arch nemesis hold a gun to a 
woman's head. The opening scene of "Mission: 
lmpo sible 3" will certainly grab your atten-
tion - too bad the rest of the ftlm won't. 

The man ulthe chair is Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) 
- the super- py. American hero-vehicle for one of the 
most self-obsessed stars in Hollywood. Hunt is front 
and center in this utterly pointless new instaUment 
of the "Mission: Impossible" franchise. Although "M: 
1-3" does manage to tell a more character-driven story 
than the first two ftlms, it still comes across as a bloated 
act.ion flick whose only pu!p9 e is to make money and 
inflate ruise's ego. 

In the first and best "Mis ion: Impossible; Hunt was 
a smooth Impossible Mission Force agent who never 
flinched , even when he wa flaillng on a helicopter 
shield. Helmed by Brian DePalma, the film wa a slick. 
plot-heavy spy thriller that kept audiences guessing. 

John Woo's cheesy follow-up not only lacked the 
intrigue of DePalma's fUm. but did nothing to further 
explore Hunt's character. Although he did have a love 
interest (Thandie Newton), the heroic leading man. like 
the rest of the movie. was all style and no substance. 

Enter director).l. Abrams (the guy behind television's 
"Lost" and "Alias"), who makes his cinematic debut with 
"M:I-3." Abrams decided to focus on Hunt's personal life 
in an attempt to make the story more realistic than the 
first two films. and although it's a little better than Woo's 
ver ion , it's still an over-the-top fistfest with a cheap 
veneer of drama. 

In "M:I-3;' Hunt plays your typical elite secret 
agent who falls in love witll a cute nurse (Michelle 
Moynaham). BlIt like all working men, he runs into 
trouble trying to balance his love li(e and his job as the 
world's coolest super spy. However. Hunt isn't exactly 
an evervman, and trying.to make him appear down-to-
e.l rth makes the far-fetched premise seem even more 
rid iculous. in the film, Hunt has almost superhuman 

powe r~ - he literally shoolS down a jet plane, leaps 
(rom one sl.,'y scraper to anolher and gets the girl, all 
111 a day's work. It's not thai ruise's acting chops are 
que tionable - he made a superb anti -hero in Michael 
Mann's "Collateral" - but Hunt is a character so unbe-

• Cruise goes 
on an ego 

. . . 

mission In 
this hashed-out 
third volume 
Lievably flawless it's hard not to interpret the role as any-
thing other than Cruise's self-aggrandizing alter-ego. 

Hunt has to go head-to-head with an evil arms 
dealer. Owen Davian (a scene-stealing Philip Seymour 
Hoffman). Hunt must stop Davian (awesome bad 
guy name) when he tries to get his hands on the most 
destructive weapon in world. In the process. his IMF 
team travels the world breaking into a series of com-
pound that are. you guessed it. really hard to break 
into. 

"M:I-3" does manage some fiery scenes between 
Hunt and Davian - Cruise and Hoffman both master 
the art of the intense stare-off when they confront each 
other. The always-entertaining Hoffman sinks his teeth 
into playing the role of the ultimate baddie, but he avoids 
the cliches of the classic villain by giving a deadpan 
performance. He never raises his voice or gives sarcastic 
remarks, and his characterizations work spectacularly. 

Compared to the earlier film" the the third is some-
where in between - it lacks the sharp intelligence of 
"Missjon: Impossible:' but it is a slight improvement 
from the nearly unwatchable second ftlm. However. it 
still raises the que tion: Wasn't one enough?

rapped with the 'Corns in the live-only !wee/rap 
group Th' Corn Gangg.) 

Return to the Sea picks up where the Upicorns 
left off: thirsty. on an island. surrounded by 
beauty with death fa t approaching. The lyrics 
soon turn to a flXation on a world postapoca-
Iyptic, where love stories about cannibalism go 
hand in hand with island (Ha!) deserted by 
humanity. Thankfully, the occaSionally dour (but 
usually clever) Iyrici m - "You can whistle my 
name l it's the mines in Africa Ihat are to blame;' 
and "If you ain't sweet to me I I'll dessert you in 
a heartbeat" - doesn't prevent Diamonds from 
keeping to his irresistibly cutesy melodies. Now 
that he's in a "serious" band, he sounds like he's 
training to be Wayne Coyne's (the Flaming Lips) 

replacement. Combined with ramie's perfectly 
complementary indie-rock syncopation, Islands 
seem prepared to take on the mainstream with a 
grab bag of mature. perfectly crafted songs, some 
o( which make me forget that the Unicorns ever 
existed. 

But while the Unicorns could win me over 
with thei r innocent sloppiness, there's no room 
for mistakes with the meticulous Islands - and 
there are mistakes: The boring instrumental 
"Tsuxiit" (if only they could write 'em like the 
Lips!) and a sleeper of a final song (the one before 
seven minutes of silence and an excellent bonus 
track) make me wish the Unicorns never up and 
went extinct. We all have to grow up sometime. 
but that doesn't mean we have to like it. 

Islands wiU perform at the Epicentre on May 4. 

Muir Movie. IV: Crushes, Lies and Video Tape 
• MUIR MOVIE, from page 6 
love-story success or bring about his downfall 
when Francesca finds out about his wily ways? 

Fourth-year visual arts major Nick Louie, the 
other co-director, is bent on not giving anything 
away. Going over fUm footage in the dimly lit 
editing room of the Media Center last Saturday 
night, he modestly declined to advertise the 
movie. Louie said that he learned to think crili-
cally through his classes at UCSD, but learned 
the technical aspects of filmmaking through 
his work with Muir Movie. Students involved, 
according to Louie, turned to Muir Movie look-
ing for a creative outlet that 10-minute clips 
made for clas es couldn't provide. 

It turned out to be painsta.king labor. The 
directors woke every cast member at 7 a.m. 
every Saturday and Sunday, and didn't get home 
until late at night. Casting for the movie began 
in fall 2005, and filming continued until early 
spring - then the arduous editing process 
began. The . flllal product should be only 50 
minutes long, so a huge amount of film had to 
be edited out. 

Anderson-Moore said that this year's cast, 
totaling 15 to 20 members. was the result of a 
more extensive casting effort than any of the 
previous three years. Everyone is encouraged to 
audition, but when mere encouragement falls 
flat, Anderson-Moore said, "You just rhave] to 

bribe them to.oome." 
Since John Muir College provides most of 

the funding. the name of the organization is 
Muir Movie, but about half the members aren't 
actually from the college. 

Alex is played by fourth -year theater major 
Steven Lone, a familiar face among undergradu-
ate actors, having been in several plays, includ-
ing "Measure for Measure," "As You Like It" and 
"Closer" (as well as other cabarets in the San 
Diego community). Before coming to UCSD. 
Lone was in other semiprofeSSional acting roles 
in San Francisco where he made a "small Hving 
off actin g." 

Anderson-Moore said that although Lone 
was "originally too good-looking to play the role 
we had in mijtd, he essent ially blew us away at 
audition:' 

Despite the technical difficulties of fLIming, 
such a angling Lighting, choosing a location, 
battling daylight and, especialLy, scheduling with 
all the actors, both directors hope that the mak-
ing has been fun for all involved. 

"There might be gratuitous nudity shots;' 
Lone said. "Let's just say there's a lot of extra 
footage they could blackmail me for~

8 HIATUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN' THURSDAY, MAY", 2006 

recordings¥----------
The Yeah Yeah Yeahs 
• Show Your Bones 
INT£RSCOI'E 

The: sophomore album - it can be a monumental undertaking for an up-and-coming band that wants to stay relevant. Sometimes it can prove to be fatal (Hot 
Hot Heats Elevator), Other times, the result is mixed (Franz 
Ferdinand's You Couid Have it So Much Better). Thankfully, 
neither is the case with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' exquisite sec-
ond full -length record, Show Your Bones. 

Their debut album; 2003's Fever to Tell, was snazzy 
enough to earn a ISS spot on the Billboard 200, yet it left 
a lackluster first impression_ (.ead singer Karen O's soul-
ful voice flourished on the record's single, "Maps,' but she 
shriektd and yelped on too many of the album's sloppy 
tracks, 

Fortunately, the blind cleaned up its act on Bones ~d 
the result ili a catchy, energetic rock compilation without a 

single disappointing song. Sure, the band still likes to sound 
raw and muffled as hell, but this time, O's jazzy pipes accen-
tuate each rhythmic rock ballad. 

The Yeah Yeah Yeah, have certainly toned down their 
gritty sound since they first hit the New York dub scene in 
2000, bUt they still remain true to their indie rock roots on 
Bones. Don't be fooled by the slow intro on "Warrior" and 
"The Sweets" - each song pick.~ up the pace for a dramatic, 
soundtrack-worthy finilih. 

The Yeah Yeah Yeahs may have emerged in the shadow 
of garage-rock counterparts like the Strokes and the White 
Stripes, but Bones proves thcy'U be around for the long 
haul-

Mobb Deep 
• Blood Money 
INTERSCOP£IG-UNIT 

*~ 
When Mobb Deep signed with 50 Cent and his G-Unit team last year, fans of the duo hoped it might reignite their career, but also acknowledged that 
the guaranteed increase in income could perpetuate their 
emerging laziness. With the release of Blood MOiley, their 
seventh official release. it is abundantly clear that G-Unit 
membership has only caused the latter result. 

Havoc and Prodigy, the two MCs in Mobb Deep, are 
rap legends for a reason. "Shook Ones PI. W is regarded 
by some as one of the greatest rap songs of all time, and 10 
years later, listening to most tracks on Infamous or Hell on 
Earth will still send chills down my spine_ Unfortunately, 
the lethargic lyricism on Blood Money is more likely 10 
induce nausea than anything else. 

't is hard to believe the same MC that set the tone 

for hardcore New York rap with the line, "ain't no such 
things 'as halfway crooks» is now spitting that "they ask 
for help, like I'm the Red Cross." Havoc Jlso refers to his 
watch as his preSident, with his princess-cut diamond _ 
his "first lady." It is laughably lame lines l,ike these that 
raise the question: Did they even listen to this before its 
release? 

Mobb Deep has been reeling ever since Jay-Z ripped 
them apart on "Takeover~ and this half-assed alb,"n 
completes Iheir fall from grace. Mobb Deep, now in Iheir 
late 3Os, probably will never record another album, and if 
they do, G-Unit's IS Cent, Phony Yayo and Lloyd Tanks 
can't help much.

THURSDAY, ~Y ., 2006 THE UCSD GUAItDIAN SPORTS 11 

Rigorous Practice Schedule 
Leads Men's Crew to Success YOUR RJTURE IS GOING FULL SPEED AHEAD. ARE YOU IN THE DRIVER SEAT? 
• CREW, from page 12 
. Varsity won the second place 

title for the match, ahead of UC 
Davis with a time of 5;57 and only 
three seconds behind first-place 
Colorado State. 

· When we crossed that finish 
line, we had open water on OCC 
and Davis and it was extremely 
emotiona!,' Carriker said. "We were 
in lane sill and really seemed to 
come out of nowhere. There', just 
something about when everyone in 
the boat clicks that', so perfect. It's 
indescribable. It's hard to be able to 
set ourselves with confidence with 
teams that beat us all year long. 
When you feel a bit behind the rest. 
it's sometimes hard to pull away 
from that mindaet but this time we 
gave ounelves no boundaries." 

With the practice schedule the 
team endures weekly. future pro.-
pects appear promising. The team 
holds two practices a day. six days 
a week. 'tarting out on tilt water 
at 5:30 each morning. On Tuesday 
and Thunday afternoons. lhe team 
does high intensity land practice on 
rowing IlUIchines for a good aerobic 
foundation. Mondays, Wednesdays 
and Fridays are dedicated to bulk· 
ing up in weight training, followed 
by yoga on fridays, and occasional 
runs when weather is bad. . 

·We practice every day like it's 
race day; Bnvo said. ·We want to 
leave it all out on the water and have 
no energy left after a practice. so 
when those sill minutes on race day 
come. it should be our easiest day, 
hypothetically. In the mornings, we 
put four boats out and we get com-
petitive with each other and start 
racing ourselves for bragging rights. 
but il helps puah us into a real race 
scenario.' 

Such a rigorous routine takes a 
great toll on all of the other aspects 

of life for the dedicated group of 
college students. including academ-
ies. though they try their best to 
avoid it. 

"I tend to f&ll aa1eep in all my 
dasses and don't really have much of a 
social life during crew 11eaIOII,' Rubin 
said. "We have to get a ·minimum of 
lOur to five hours sleep or we really 
won't make it through the next day.' 

Collins said that. despite the men-
tally and physically draining days. it 
all &«I1U worth it in the end. 

"It's the seaJOn that never end.; 
be said. "It require. a discipline of 
bavins to go 10 deep early. rearrang-
ing your clus schedule according 
to practices and a lot of willpower.

UCSD Says Aloha to Hawaii After Rout of Son9ma 
Sweep of Seawolves 
sends Tritons to Hilo 
for chance to beat 
Vulcans for first time 
in NCAA Tournament. 

By Dcmai Leininger 
ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR 

With a 5·0 win over Sonoma 
State in the first round of the 
NCAA Division- II West Regional 
Tournament on April 29, the No. 
J 7 UCSD women's tennis team will 
live to play at least one more game 
- a ,econd round dare with the 
Univers ity of Hawaii-Hilo - for a 
chance to advance toward a nation-
al title. 

Following a tough regular sea-
son loss to Cal State Northridge 
on April 22, the Tritons jumped 
out to an early 3-0 lead in dou-
bles play against Sonoma State to 
kick off the tournament. UCSD's 
top pair of juniors, Katie McKee 
and Kristin Bronowicki, put down 
the Sea wolves' No. 1 partners, 
trouncing Becky Kiehn and Megan 
Malinsky 8· I. 

Junior Marsha Malinow and 
freshman Ina Dan extended the 
Tritons' lead with an 8-5 win over 
Laura Robertson and Mallory 
Cantrell, anq sophomores Justine 
Ang Fonte and Molly Sullens joined 
forces to outplay Erin Kramer and 
Amy Piepenbrink 8-4. 

Upon entering singles play, 
the Tritons needed only two more 
wins to secure a victory, as NCAA 
tournament regulations stipu-
late for play to stop as soon as a 
team clinches a win. Sensing the 
victory within their reach, the 
Tritons con'tinued to dominate, 
with Bronowicki notching the first 
Triton singles win in a 6-1, 6-0 
schooling of Laura Buck. 

Only one win away from advanc-
ing to the second round, UCSD 
'Iooked to its young star Dan, who 
was recently named California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
Freshman of the Year. 

Dan did not disappoint, cruising 
to a 6-2, 6-2 win over Robertson 
and springing the Tritons into the 
second round of the NCAA tour-
nament.

CCM freshman of the Year Ina Dan led the Tritons to uictoryowr theSonorna StoreSeawolva in thefirst round of the NC4A Diuision-ll WCIIt 
Regional Tournament, overwhelming her OfJPOfIf!nls in both singks and doubks play. UCSD /rim the VuIcons today in the second round. 
the CCAA honor, was pleased with 
her teammates' focused efforts 

again~t the powerless Sea wolves. 
"We knew that we couldn't be 

overconfident against Sonoma 
State," she said. "Even though 
we generally do beat them easily, 
they're a team that could poten-
tially be strong.» 

According to head coach Liz 
LaPlante, the CCAA Coach of the 
Year, Dan's award is a testament to 
her contributions to the team. 

"[Dan] has reaily improved a lot 
since she started playing with us;' 
LaPlante said. "Her confidence has 
improved tremendously, and she's 
playing the best tennis now that she 
has all year.» 

Even if Dan had fallen in her 
match, the Tritons would still have 
been in a comfortable position, as 
the rest of the singles players were 
leading their respective Sonoma 
State opponents when play was 
stopped. 

UCSD's No. 6 singles player, 
fresnman Amelia Larkin, was the 
only Triton at risk of losing, as she 
was down 2-4 in the second set 
after winning the first 6·2. 

UCSD's first-round victory 
over Sonoma State was its third 
dominant performance over the 
Seawolves this . season, with the 
Tritons previously posting lopsided 
8-1 and 9-0 victories. 

The win should also give the 
Tritons the confidence they need 
to overcome the mental advantage 
that Hawaii-Hilo earned during the 
regular season in a close 5-4 victory 
over UCSD on April 2. 

LaPlante and her team are con-
fident that the Tritons can pre-
vail in the rematch against Hilo 
after using the match against the 
Seawolves to hone their skills. 

"We were using [the Sonoma] 
mate'" as a practice run for tomor-
row," she said. "We' wanted to work 
on things and make sure we were 
focused so that we will do well 
against Hilo.» 

If the Tritons hope to succeed, 
they wiU need outstanding perfor-
mances from their usually sound 
singles contingent. In their regular 
season meeting against Hawaii-
Hilo, the Tritons' top three singles 
players of Malinow, McKee and 
Dan fell in their matches, which 

proved to make the difference in 
the match. . 

Dan hopes to avoid a similar 
finish, and feels adequately pre-
pared for the challenge ahead. 

"Everyone needs to play well 
this time around; she said. "Hilo's 
a strong squad but we're equally 
strong. 

Dan added that the Tritons have 
grown leaps and bounds since the 
close loss. 

"When we last played Hilo, we 
were a different team,» she said. 
"Our chances for success are much 
better than last time. 

If the Tritons can e1eVllte their 
play against the Vulcans, LaPlante 
expects that her team will triumph 
and represent its region at the 
NCAA Championships in Kansas 
City, Mo. 

"There's no easy answer against 
[Hilo),» she said. ·We'll go in there 
with nothing to lose and play our 
best tennis.-

The determined Tritons hope 
to end the Vulcans' season on May 
4 in Hilo, Hawaii, with a national 
championship tournament berth 
on the line. 

MEN'S CREW 
TAKES TOP 

TROPHY 
By NidI}' Buchanan 

STAff WRITER 

For a team that feels like it isn't 
getting much recognition in the ath-
letic world, the UCSD men's crew 
team is sure making waves. As of 
April 30. it was creating records as 
well, the first crew team in UCSD 
history to win an overall points 
trophy at the annual Western 
Intercollegiate Rowing Association 
Championships. . 

It was an exciting and, for some, 
surprising achievement to bring 
back home. Sophomore varsity 
rower Andrew Simpson was emo-
tional about the accomplishment. 

"Varsity was not even expected 
to medal at all, and then as they 
called the last race and we hear, 
'l,JCSD takes all ; combined with 
all of our family and some friends 
screaming our names," he said. "It 
was just amazing.» 

Junior varsity rower Gilbert 
Collins gave credit for the award to 
tl:le program as a whole, rather than 
individual efforts. 

"It was a great feeling because 
it means that, while each particu-
lar event we may not have nailed 
first place, it shows the program is 
going somewhere because each boat 
placed enough to get that trophy," he 
said. "It is very promising for what's 
to come." 

For each race the first-place boat 
received eight points, the 5econd-
place four and the third-place two, 
with the overall trophy awarded to 
the team with the most total points 
across all races. 

Each Triton team had a heat at 
varied times of the day on April 29, 
followed by the finals on April 30. 
The first race on April 30 was the 
pair final. in which UCSD placed 
third of nine with a time of 7 min-
'utes, 26 secondl, behind Cal State 
Long Beach (7:13) and Colorado 
State University (7:20). 

"We were in the lead the first 
1,500 meters,» said junior varsi -
ty pair rower Shane Rubin. "But 
towards the end we kind of lost our 
steering of the boat and by the time 
we got a solid control of it again it 
was too late, and Colorado pulled 
ahead on the lilt four seconds.-

Unlike the eight-man boats with 
a coxswain for steer control, the pair 
teams must be fully focused on both 
steering aDd quick rowing. 

The second novice-eipt was up 
next, and UCSD finished third out 
of five with a time of 6:12, trailing 
Orange Coast College and Gonzaga 
University, followed by the first nov-
ice-eight boat, in which UCSD once 
again fell behind the two schools 
with its time of 5:55. 

At 10:40 a.m., it was time for the 
junior varsity team to hit the ice-
cold water. 

"We were ahead at 1,300 meters, 
and then they slowly passed us and 
that was an intense moment because 
we just didn't want to let them 
go," said senior junior vanity rower 
Michael Bravo, referring to UC 
Davis, which cranked out firlt place 
in the lut stretch with a time of 
5:58, four seconds ahead of UCSD. 

The top Triton team set up for 
its vanity-eight race, as 18 boats 
launched onto the lake an hour later • 
for the final race of the day. 

"In order to beat Davis. we 
had to row like we've nner rowed 
before; said vanity rower and cap-
tain Brenden Carriker, "And that's 
exactly what we did,-
