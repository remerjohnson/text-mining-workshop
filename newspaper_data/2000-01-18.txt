UCSD M.ches in Annual King Parade 
COMMUNm: Nearly 
10,000 people joined 
to honor rights leader 
By PI\RIIA IIAHARIAN 
Staff writer 

The San Diego community 
joined together Saturday to 
march in honor of Martin 
Luther King Jr. in the city's 20th 
annual Martin Luther f<ing Jr. 
Day parade. Nearly 10,000 pe0-
ple, clapping and chanting at 
times, lined the streets to pay 

tribute to the slain civil rights 
leade.r and to celebrate what 
would have been his 71st birth-
day. 

The theme of this year 's 
parade was "Living the Dream: 
Let Freedom Ring," echoing the 
words of King in his famous "I 
Have a Dream" speech at the 
Lincoln Memorial in 1963. 

Hundreds of UCSD stu-
dents, staff, faculty, administra-
tors, provosts and Chancellor 
Robert Dynes turned out to 
show their support by march-
ing in the parade. 

The parade began at 10:30 
a.m. at the County 
Administration Building and 
ended shortly after 2 p.m. at the 
corner of Harbor Drive and 
Pacific Highway. 

The UCSD community was 
in the first division of the 
parade, with the UCSD Pep 
Band and staff members from 
the Medical Center, Women's 
Center and the Cross Cultural 
Center leading the pack. 
Students from Revelle .College 
followed, as well as students 
from Muir, Marshall, ' Warren 

and Roosevelt Colleges, fol -
lowed lastly by· the UCSD float. 

Marcia Strong, assistant 
director of Student 
Organizations and Leadership 
Opportunities, called the 
UCSD float "impressive" and 
said that it was "one of the best 
... since UCSD began participat-
ing in the early 1~" 

On the float stood an enor-
mous open book inscribed with 
the words: "Go to College, Stay

Muir Suitcase Dance Sends 1\vo to Chicago 
tRIP: Students participated for a chance at a trip to an undisclosed location for the long weekend 
By JANIIOM 
StaffWrlter 

Nearly 100 Muir students 
packed their suitcases and head-
ed to the Suitcase Dance at Sierra 
Summit on Friday ni$ht. The 
main attraction of the ~ght was 
an all-expenses paid trip for two 
Muir College students to an 
undisclOlied destination for the 
three-day weekend. 

"Usually, a dance is Just a 
dance, but this one kind 0 has a 
slight twist to it," said Muir 
Sophomore Senator Shige ltoh. 
wllo chaired the Suitcase Dance 
Committee. NPeople are sup-
posed to come with a bag packed 
lor any weather, and we're trad-
Ing their bag for a raffle ticket." 

The twist was that the winner 
and a guest had to be ready to 
leave on the spot. 

The pre-determined destina-
tion, Chicago, Ul., was kept a 
secret until the winner was 
announced. The trip for two 
included hotel accommodations, 
airfare, transportation to the air-
port in a black stretch limousine, 
$200 in spending money and 
beanie-styfe hats. 

Freshman Sierra Fisk was the 
lucky winner. 

Fisk chose to take her suitem-
ate, Haley Hoffmeister. Fisk said 
she was 110 surprised that, at first, 
she didn't know what to say or 
who to take. 

"[Hoffmeister] was the only 
one from my suite who was 

standing there, so I just said 
'come with me,'" Fisk said. 

Hoffmeister said that while 
she didn't ~ack appropriately 
for Chicago s weather, she was 
fully supportive of the Muir 
event. 

"I wasn't ready at all. We 
thought we were going to Hawaii, 
90 I packed shorts," Hoffmeister 
said. "I think [The Suitcase Dance] 
is awesome! This is such a good 
idea, and it's so fun!" 

Fisk and Hoffmeister weren't 
the only ones who thought the 
trip would be to a tropical loca-
tion. 

"They're probably sending us 
to Hawaii tonight," freshman 
Dave Harnsberger said before 
the true destination was 

revealed. '1 heard through the 
grapevine that it's Hawaii." 

Freshman Suzanne Ryan, 
however, said she heard other-
wise, and planned accordingly. 

"I packed lots of cold weather 
stuff, including my ice skates. 
I've heard rumors that it's sup-
posed to be chilly," Ryan said. 

While many students were 
concerned about packing for 
weather conditions, others con-
centrated on preparing for a 
relaxing break from classes. 

"I packed a book. It's a book 
I'm reading for fun, and I figure 
if I'm not doing homework this 
weekend, then I might get some 
reading done," frestUnan Melissa 
Kahn said. "It's not a school 
weekend."

Jamba Juice Debuts 
SMOOTHIE: Store has long lines but good smoothies 
By MATT SCHRADER 
Staff Writer 

lines in the Price Center take that 
long anyway." 

The large crowds of people 
waiting inside the store for their 
orders often give the impression 
that the store is busier than it is. 

The constant lines outside the 
Price Center's new Jamba Juice 
smoothie bar have evidently not 

reduc~d the business' popularity 
with student customers. 

"[ like Jamba Juice because it is 
one of the few nutritional places to 
eat on campus," Revelle freshman 
Luke Pamerarantz said. 

"Compared to Round Table or 
Wendy's, it provides good nutri-
tion and tastes pretty dam good." 

As is evidenced by Jamba 
Juice's initial popularity, many 
people throughout the school 
share Pamerarantz's sentiments. 
As a result, the smoothie bar's 
patrons are waiting in line for ten 
or more minutes while other 
orders are being filled . 

On the Juice - the restaurant 
that previously occupied Jamba 
Juice's location - went out of 
business earlier this year when 
the manager decided to pursue 
another career. Jamba Juice 
bought out On the Juice's con-
tract, renovated the store and 
opened last Tuesday. 

"[ think it is great that they 
moved into this place," Vahdat 
said. "It looks great, and 1 am 
glad we could keep it consistent 
of what was here before." 

According to University 
Centers Advisory Board Vice 
Chair ima Vahdat, the popular-
ity of on-campus food establish-
ments generates long lines. 

Similar to On the Juice's menu 
choices, Jamba Juice has made it 
easier to maintain a vegetarian 
lifestyle while eating on campus. 

"The smoothies just taste 
good," Adame said. "There is 
just not a lot of options on cam-
pus for a vegetarian." 

"Unfortunately, that is a prob-
lem with all the vendors on cam-
pus," he said. "However, the 
Jamba Juice employees are partic-
ularly fast, and it doesn' t take 
that long to make." 

Regardless of this fact, many 
students who have already visi t-
ed the new Jamba Juice believe 
the apparent wait is less than it 
initially appears. 

Currently, Jamba Jllice offers 
over 20 different smoothies, most 
of which are vegetarian and can 
be made without any dairy prod-
ucts. The smoothies, which come 
in either 24-ounce or 32-ounce 
sizes, are considered by some to 
be a satisfying low-fat meal 
replacement. 

"The line usually only takes 
five minutes even though it looks 
like more than that," student 
Melissa Adame said. "All the 

"The serving sizes are Eretty 
big," Pamerara ntz said. 'They 
can add some ice cream to [the 
smoothies), but they are low-fat 
and the smoothies are not full of 
empty calories."

PARADE: 
Elementary school 
student designed float 
Cowll ... ed from ..... 1 
All for One ... One for All .. . Get 
Good Grades." 

Ophelia Cortez, a student at 
Caesar Chavez Elementary 
School, designed the UCSD float. 

Susan Taylor, director of gov-
ernmental and community rela-
tions, said there was a school con-
test in December and Cortez's 
submission was the winning 
design. Taylor said that the John 
Green Company in Los Angeles 
constructed the float. 

The UCSD cpntingent of the 
parade played upbeat music, 
waved and handed out UCSD 
pencils, rulers and small trinkets 
to the children on the sidewalks. 

Dynes said he has participated 
in the parade for the last four 
years because he wants students 
to know that he cares about the 
event. 

Susanna Martinez Perez, a 
Muir freshman who plays the 
clarinet in the UCSD Pep Band, 
said that when she grew up in 
Ventura County, there wasn't a 
parade in celebration of the 
Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. 

"This is my first parade and 
it's really exciting to see a lot of 
people come out to celebrate 
Martin Luther King's birthday 
holiday," Perez said. 

Marshall College students, 
whose level of participation was 
the highest, chanted "Marshall! 
Marshall!" as they marched in the 
parade. . 

"The parade embodies 
Marshall College's philosophy. 
That's why there are so many of 
us here," said Amber Carini, a 
member of the Marshall Council. 

Begun in 1980, the parade is 
sponsored by the Alpha Phi fra-

temity, the Centre City 
Development Corporation and 
the San Diego City Art and 
Culture Commission. 

Liora Kian Gutierrez, the assis-
tant dean of student affairs at 
Revelle College, said the turnout 
was excellent this year for UCSD, 
even though it was a holiday 
weekend. Students planned 
ahead to participate in the event. 

Gutierrez marched with her 
ll-yea r-old son to sho~ him the 
importance of community. 

"1 bring my son and we march 
everx year because it's a great les-
son, , she said. 

The parade included band 
competitions, dance competitions, 
convertibles with several mayoral 
candidates and floats that reflect-
ed the entire community. 

The Statue of Liberty float 
reaffirmed the theme of the 
parade: "Let Freedom Ring." 
Another float reflected the words 
spoken by Martin Luther King Jr.: 
"Everybody can be great, because 
anybody can serve." 

Revelle student Teresa 
Sanoval said this is her second 
year marching in the parade. 

" I did it last year, it's fun, and 
it feels good to march together for 
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr," she 
said. 

A.S. President Tesh Khullar 
said the reason he participates 
every year is because he admires 
King. 

"Martin Luther King Jr. is one 
of my most inspirational figures." 

Revelle freshman Andrea 
Palladino said her favorite float 
was a red car adorned with a 
Spanish message, which trans-
lates in Englisl) as: ,. Happy 
Birthday Rev. Martin Luther King 
Jr., we owe you our thanks." 

"That message is what the 
entire day should be about, for 
King followed his convictions 
and he was killed because of 
them," Palladino said.

Recent spy cases are not signs of prejudice but 
rather reflect the reality of modern espionage 
By BRENT DON 
Opinion Editor 

In the post-Cold War era the United 
States is faced with an international bal-
ance of power that is far more confuSing 
than the cut-and-dry opposition of the 
First and Second Worlds that defined our 
country's foreign policy from the mid-'40s 
until the start of the '90s. With the breakup 
of the Soviet Union, the United States' 
archneml'sis was finally deposed, but 
rather than bringing an 
end to the nation's securi-

ernment accused him of leaking nuclear 
information to the People's Republic of 
China. Information seems to indicate that 
Lee did not intentionally try to leak any 
secrets, but rather, violated the laborato-
ry's security measures by making classi-
fied computer files available on an unse-
cure server, came into. Whether or not the 
PRC or any other country was able to gain 
access to these files is not known. 

Some critics cried racism in response to 
the accusations of Chinese Americans as 

ty concerns, this event 
only brought ambiguity 
and uncertainty. 

Who will be the great-
est threat to the United 
States now that we are 
the world's only super-
power? Will another jug-
gernaut arise to replace 

con 
agents of espionage.

cover up their own negli-

the deceased Soviet Union? Will an 
alliance of smaller states in Europe, the 
Middle East or Asia conspire against the 
United States? Or will the greatest threat 
come from decentra1ized nationalist and 
terrorist groups? 

The most obvious candidate for a sec-
ond Cold War superpower seems to be 
China. Although blind antagonism 
toward communists became somewhat 
passe in a society that was raised to abhor 
the mindless political Witch-hunts of 
McCarthyism, the fact remains that the 
United States and China often butted 
heads over a variety of foreign policy 
issues. Political confrontations over inter-
national trade, human rights and territori-
al disputes over the sovereignty of Tibet 
and Taiwan created a level of tension 
between the two nations that only seems 
to be leading them closer and closer to a 
full-blown Cold War. 

The latest episode of this international 
drama centered on various incidents of 
espionage supposedly perpetrated by the 
Chinese government against the United 
States. These acts of "technology acquisi-
tion," as Congress quaintly refers to them, 
focused primarily on obtaining U.S. 
nuclear arid military secrets. A special con-
greasional committee on the subject deter-
mined that China stole technical specifica-
tions on every nuclear wea~ in the U.s. 
arsenal, as well as design mformation on 
the neutron bomb, an enhanced radiation 
weapon that China reportedly construct-
ed and tested using information stolen 
from U.S. weapons research.

remains that he violated

tigators would have been lapse in their 
duties if they had not tried to determine 
whether or not the incident involved espi-
onage. 

The frequent numbers of Asian 
Americans accused of conducting espi-
onage for China is in fact evidence of 
racism, but it is on the part of China. The 
fact is, most of the American citizens the 
Chinese government recruits as spies are 
Asian American. 

The spy agencies of the PRC are faced 
with the same dilemma that confronted 
the KGB, the former Russian secret 
police and intelligence agency, in the 
So~iet-era; they find it increasingly diffi-
cult to recruit American scientists and 
government officials on the basis of 
political ideology, especially since the 
collapse of the communist system in 
Russia. For this reason, the Chinese gov-
ernment most often exploits the nation-
alism of ethnic Chinese in order to tempt 
them into committing treason. American 
citizens who were either convicted of 
acts of espionage or who came forward 
to report that they were approached by 
Chinese officials asking them to do so 
revealed that they were bribed with 
offers 01 arranging visits to their ances-
tral homes and relatives in China, with 
paid trips within the PRC and by gener-
ally trying to appeal to the person's

Days Off Are Irrevocable 
COMMENTARY: Class schedule should not override holidays 
By KIM HOOPER 
Staff Writer 

After receiving a daunting syllabus for 
each class and stocking up on caffeine-
packed drinks in/reparation for all those 
long nights ahea ,spring break seems all 
too far away. In order to avoid that nag-
ging temptation to accidentally fall o~er 
the railing on the third floor of Pnce 
Center and bring a dramatic ·end to the 
misery by landing on someone's half~ten 
burrito, students focus on the one sIlver 
lining in the dreary winter quarter-
national holidays. 

Getting Mondays off has been a sacred 
occurrence since elementary school. It's 
not that I do anything special on those hol-
idays, aside from sleeping in late and 
watching "The Price Is Right" while eating 
Eggo waffles, but I still cherish the oppor-
tunity to wear my pajamas into the after-
noon on a day other than Saturday or 
Sunday. Maybe I associate it with that rush 
I felt on those rebellious high school days 
when I pulled a Ferris Bueller. Although 
Martin Luther King Jr. Day and President's 
Day are dictated as days off by the federal 
government, there is still that childish 
sense of freedom that keeps the over-
worked soul alive. 

Being b\lrdened with a skeptical mind,I 
am one of those annoying people who asks 
the administration the purpose of every 
dollar I pay in the "processing .fee." I. left 
the University of Notre Dame m Indiana 
partly because I felt claustrophobic, crowd-
ed by rules about curfews and pressures to 
have Mid-Western, conservative values 
and say ten Hail Marys every night. 

When I decided to transfer to UCSD, I 
hoped to find a gneater sense of liberation. 
I thoUght that with a huge campU&. the 
bureaucracy of UCSD would have given 
up on trying to control student lives. As 
time goes on here, the claustrophobia is 
returning. I was adjusting - until th.e 
administration infringed upon my hob-

day rights. 
On the first day of my Methods of 

Media Production lecture, I sat down to 
hear that all stuJients in Monday's three-
hour lab would have to show up, despite 
the holiday. Like I said, I would not have 
done much with Monday aSide from 
spending it with Bob Barker, but I still felt 
cheated. I talked to one of the teacher's 
assistants after class, who said that I could 
switch into another section. Unfortunately, 
I'm taking 18 units and switching would 
not exactly fit into my schedule. Then she 
said that I could miss it, but it would affect 
my "progress in the class" (whatever that 
means). 

It felt like I was being blackmailed into 
accepting this apparent denoun~ent of 
Martin Luther King Jr. Day. A fnend of 
mine said that she had to come to class on 
Monday as well. People, it's Martin Luther 
King Jr.! He had a dream, he changed the 
world. How could media lab be more 
important than that? 

I'm not going to pretend that I would 
have spent all of Monday po"dering what 
Martin Luther King Jr. did to better society, 
but the fact is that it was declared a nation-
al holiday for a reason, a day to set aside in 
the name of someone who made a differ-
ence. My required presence in the media 
center lab is in violation of federal law. 

As always, I wondered what was next. 
Well, my TA told me: no President's Da.y 
holiday either. That leap in Price Center IS 
getting more and more appealing. 

But, in all seriousness, UCSD (and 
specifically my communications class) is 
stepping over the line in this case. If the 
classes could only be organized in a way 
that accommodated the holidays, it would 
save Martin Luther King Jr. and a host of 
deceased presidents from rolling over in 
their graves. Certainly, students should not 
have to be a part of this pseudo-fascist aca-
demic boot camp. This is so ridiculous; I 
just might have to say a couple Hail Marys.

Costs of Low-Carb Diet 
Outweigh the Payoff 
COMMENTARY: The results of current fad diet just aren't 
worth giving up all the foods that make life worth living 
By DlVYA RUNCHAL 
Columnist 

It started off as an idle thought and 
developed into madness. One morning as 
I went to wash my face, I noticed that my 
cheeks were a tad chunkier than the previ-
ous day. Perhaps it was just paranoia, but 
a dreadful question arose inside me -
was I getting fat? -:'Ithough ev~rybody 
insisted I looked fme, I took It upon 
myself to flip through a fashion magazine 
in the hope of discovering the secrets of 

During this temporary bout of insani-
ty, I even gave up two of my favor~te 
foods in the entire world: cereal and diet 
Coke. On the first day of my diet I day-
dreamed about a world replete with 
sandwiches and fruits without the carbo-
hydrates. Yet, my euphoria was shattered 
when I realized I was supposed to stay 
on the strictest level of the diet, which 
allowed only 20 grams of carbohydrates 
a day, the equivaTent of two bananas, for 
two weeks. 

As I trudged from class to class, fueled 
being slim. 

I skimmed an arti-
cle on the latest food 
fad permeating the 
market: the low-carb 
diet. As I read the tes-
timonial and glanced 

. only by meals of 

O cheese or meat, I felt G PINI 0 N- like I was living like OLUMN a barbarian. I noticed how ~very­
one else enjoyed 
their food while I 

at the pictures of women transformed from 
Rubenesque figures to Ally McBeals, I 
decided that I too would be able to achieve 
a Claudia Schiffer body by closely adher-
ing to a diet that eliminated b:-ead, pasta, 
crackers, milk, soda, dessert, fruit and large 
portions of vegetables from my diet. 

Instead, I was allowed to wolf down 
as much protein as I could eat. This 
included all the cheeses in the world, 
meats and baskets and baskets of eggs. 
Although it sounded insane, I was actu-
ally encouraged to eat fats such a.s butter, 
olive oil and plenty of bacon while erad-
icating apples and bananas from my diet 
because they contain too many carbohy-
drates and sugars. Brainwashed and 
determined to look thinner, I gave away 
my delicious chocolate chip cookies to 
my roommate and piled my pantry with 
loads of bacon, eggs and nuts that would 
have made any Y2K survivalist green 
with envy. 

was restricted to one low-fat cracker. After 
four strict days on the diet, I finally broke 
free. 

When I went home to Los Angeles dur-
ing the weekend, my mom took me out to 
a Persian restaurant, the epitome of hell 
for people on the low-carb diet. As deli-
ciousrlates of spiced meat dishes lay on 
top 0 heaps of rice and ot.her ~rbohy­
drate-ridden foods, I dug m WithOUt a 
thought about my days of cheese and 
plain turkey. 

Looking back, two weeks later, I real-
ize how ridkulous my diet actually was. 
Although I did lose a few pounds, it was 
not realistic to continue with a diet that 
took the fun out of eating. So, for every-

' body who finishes reading t~is, head 
straight to the carbohydrate aisles now 
and stop worrying about whether or not 
you've gained one pound on your butt.

Humor Doesn't Diminish C.A.P.E.'s Worth 
Editor: 

In the Jan. 13 letter to the edi-
tor "CA.P.E. Policy Violates 
Purpose," Professor Willie 
Brown concluded that the inclu-
sion of outrageous comments in 
the "Off the Wall" section of 
CA.P.E. violates CA.P.E.'s stat-
ed purpose. 

Professor Brown summa-
rized CA.P.E.'s statement of 
purpose as "to serve sl'Jdents, 
faculty and those individuals 
who evaluate faculty." This 
abridgment is misleading 
because it implies that CA.P.E. 
exists to serve those three enti-
ties equally. The CA .P.E. state-
ment of purpose in the 1999 edi-
tion reads: 

"CA.P.E. serves three popu-
lations on campus. Foremost 
among these are the students 
who utilize C.A.P.E. as a mode 
of expression and as an invalu-
able supplement when schedul-
ing classes. CA.P.E. also serves 
professors by providing them 
feedback that they can freely 
access anytime after final grades 
are distributed. Lastly, C.A.P.E. 
helps administrators gauge the 
caliber of UCSD's academic 
environment .from a student's 
perspective and aids them in 
discerning the qualities demon-
strated by potential faculty 
members.' 

Does the inclusion of the "Off 
the Wall" section interfere with 
CA.P.E.'s ability to St:rve the 
UCSD faculty? Certainly not. 
The professors receive both !lUm-
mary sheets of the relative scale 
questions and all the written 
comments on evaluations direct-
ly from the C.A.P.E. staff.

Does the inclusion of the 
1I0ff the WaH" section prevent 
the CA.P.E. staff from ade-
quately serving those who eval-
uate the faculty? Not at all. 
Each department still receives 
the statistics from the relative 
scale questions directly from 
C.A.P.E. 

Finally, does the inclusion of 
HOff the Wall" impair CA.P.E.'s 
service to the UCSD student 
body? Absolutely not. C.A.P.E. is 
valuable to students as an inde-
pendent, impartial body provid-
ing Wormation on the qualifica-
tions of the faculty in each 
department and evaluations of 

both the classes and the teach-
ing faculty at UCSD. The inclu-
sion of "Off the Wall" motivates 
students to buy, read and thus 
benefit from the C.A.P.E. evalu-
ations. 

The sheer llumber of classes 
offered at UCSD prohibits 
extensive ~valuation of each 
one. For this reason, CA.P.E. 
only includes comments voiced 
by 10 percent of the class in its 
formal evaluations. The "Off the 
Wall" sections provide exam-
ples of unedited comments 
whose content is not represent- . 
ed in the official evaluations. 

Do these comments some-
times demonstrate "intellectual 
mediocrity, cultural and gender 
biases and irresponsibility?" 
Yes, absolutely. Do UCSD stu-
dents write evaluations that are 
intellectually mediocre, biased 
on the basis of gender and cul-
tural differences and irresponsi-
ble? Yes, absolutely. Should 
C.A.P.E., as an impartial body 
compiling evaluations include 
extreme comments (both posi-
tive and negative) with the edit-
ed summaries of responses? Yes, 
absolutely. 

If Professor Brown dislikes 
the "Off ·the Wall" comments, 
perhaps he should write a letter 
to the editor imploring UCSD 
students to act in a manner 
respectful to themselves, their 
classmates and their professors 
even when they are guaranteed 
anonymity. Attacking the 
C.A.P.E. staff for the comments 
made by students is shooting the 
messenger for bringing bad 
news.

ContIMIed from ..... 4 
acts of espionage for China . 
Wealthy businessmen were tar-
geted for prosecution of espi-
onage or illegal campaign contri-
butions; almost all of them are 
Chinese Americans. 

The history of the United 
States is full of stories of racial 
groups targeted for discrimina-
tion because of political hostility 
toward foreign countries. In par-
ticular, Asian Americans experi-
enced brutal treatment during 
World War II . Japanese 
Americans were rounded up 
from their homes and sent to con-
centration camps when Japan 
declared war against the United 
States. Japanese Americans were 
called names such as "Japs" and 
were accused of spying for Japan.

simply, the majority of the pe0-

purpose are Chinese. This trend 
will continue until the Chinese 
government deigns to practice

such as "Krauts," and their loyal-
ty to the United States was con-
stantly questioned. 

Similarly, if Chinese 
Americans' loyalty is being ques-
tioned even in times of peace, 
war time may prove disastrous 
for Asian Americans. China's 
increasing military strength, 
added to its desire to take over 
Taiwan, could mean a~ all-out 
war, or at least military skirmish-
es with the United States. If 
seeds of anti-Asian sentiments 
are planted now during peClce 
time through irresponsible accu-
sations of Chinese espionage, 
these seeds can mature into 
racist disasters during times of 
war. Even without war, the anti-
Asian trend may grow as a result 
of racism and economic competi-
tion with Asia. Such a trend is 
not desirable for Asian 
Americans, nor the rest of 
America who rely on coopera-
tion of all races as the foundation 
of our society.

that specifically targets certain 
persons because of their race is 
wholly unacceptable. However, 
no federal agencies' practices 
currently target Asian 
Americans, or any other ethnici-
ty for that matter, nor do any of 
the recommendations made in 
the wake of recent discoveries of 
acts of espionage advocate doing 
so. 

Treason has always been a sen-
sitive issue. Nobody likes being 
associated with it, let alone 
accused of it. Bringing accusa-
tions of racial prejudice into the 
issue when there is no evidence of

China Installs Baby as 'Living Buddha' ISRAEL: 
Both sides agreed to 
send experts 

This Syrian demand was 
made in response to the leaking 
in the Israeli press last week of 
the American draft peace treaty, 
diplomats said. The draft was 
interpreted In the Arab world 
as Syria making big conces-
sions. 

BEIJING - Chinese authori-
ties have presided over the 
enthronement of a 2-year-old boy 
as an important "living Buddha" 
in the Tibetan religion, the offi-
cial New China News Agency 
reported Monday. 

On Monday in India, the gov-
ernment-in-exile of the Dalai 
Lama, the revered spiritual

Disagree on Racial Profiling 

DES MOINES, Iowa 
Hoping to stir doubts about the 
administration's commitment to 
minorities, former Sen. Bill 
Bradley on Monday night chal-
\enged Vice President Al Gore to 
press President Clinton to issue 
an executive order banning racial 
profiling. 

Gore fired back with a forceful 
defense of the president in a brief 
but sharp confrontation between 
the two Democratic presidential 
candidates as they appeared in 
their sixth - and final - debate 
before the first votes are cast in the 
Iowa caucuses neXt Monday night. 

Bradley seized the offensive 
after Gore pledged to sign an 
executive order banning profil-
ing, the practice of singling out 
blacks for police questioning. 

"You know, AI, I know that you 
would issue an order to end racial 
profiling if you were president of

"But we have a president now. 
You serve with him. I want you to

The exchange over racial pro-

Drug Makers Agree to Merge 
LONOON - The summer of 

1997 was unusually dreary for 
Glaxo Wellcome PLC despite an 
unusually warm and sunny sea-
son. 

Glaxo's patent for its prize 
drug, Zantac, an anti-ulcer med-
ication that was the best-selling 
drug in the United States in 1996 
expired that summer. Without 
another patent-protected block-
buster drug in its arsenal to 
immediately replace Zantac, the 
British pharmaceutical company 
began looking for a merger part-
ner with some probable hit 
drugs in the pipeline. 

While copycat drug makers 
began marketing a generic ver-
sion of Zantac, Glaxo began talk-
ing late that year in earnest 
about merging with SmithKline 
Beecham PLC, another British 
drug maker that had the the 
pipeline Glaxo wanted. In it was 
a drug called Avandia, a diabetes 
treatment with smash hit written 
all over it. 

Glaxo had marketing 

resources and money to bum on 
research, and SmithKline had a 
Significant drug pipeline - but 
neither company had the size 
and scale to achieve the kind of 
success the two companies could 
achieve together. 

Only one problem stood 
between the two drug makers: 
the egos of Glaxo's chairman, Sir 
Richard Sykes, and SmithKline's 
chief executive, Jan Leschly. 
Neither executive wanted to 
give up control of his drug fief-
dom. 

On Monday, as Glaxo 
announced that it would 
acquire SmithKline for about 
$76 billion in stock, both execu-
tives ceded the control they so 
valued to a third man, Jean-
Pierre Gamier. Garnier, the 
chief operating officer of 
SmithKline wiJI take the reins of 
the newly anointed largest drug 
maker in the world, Glaxo 
SmithKline, stepping into the 
role of chief executive. 

Sir Richard, 57, will become 

the nonexecutive chairman of 
the combined company and may 
retire in 2002 when he turns 60, 
while Leschly will leave the 
combined company entirely 
when he relines in April. 

With the market expecting 
more cost savings than the 
combined company pledged, 
shares of Glaxo dropped 4.7 
percent, or 86 pence, to 1,732 
pounds, and SmithKline fell 6.9 
percent, or 58.5 pence, to 788.5 
pounds. 

As part of the deal, Glaxo 
shareholders will get 58.75 per-
cent of the new company, while 
SmithKline shareholders will 
control 41.25 percent. 

Srnithl<line shareholders will 
get 0.4552 shares of Glaxo 
SmithKline in exchange for each 
share of SmithKline that they 
own. Glaxo shares will be 
exchanged on a one-for-one

Credit card companies prey on unsuspecting, ill-informed students who 

often are unaware of the lasting damage that can be done to their credit. 

By Beth Arnese; Staff Writer 

w 
hen Elisa Weifel 
signed up for four 
credit cards dur-
ing Welcome 
Week of her fresh-
man year, she 

neverthou~tshe 
would be dealing 

with the consequences four years 
later. Now Weifer is a senior and still 
has not paid off these cards complete-
ly. 

"It was so easy to get any credit 
card I wanted," Weifel said: "1 would 
walk by [credit card vendors) on my 
way to class. They would offer me 
cookies or a . free T-shirt, and it 
would be too easy. I believe that 
these credit card companies are like 
predators. I signed up for these cred-
it cards because I thought that it 
would be good to establish a great 
credit record, but in reality they 
destroyed my credit." 

How eomp.nI •• a.t on c:..p.. 
According to John Turk, Director 

of the UCSD Bookstore, there are 
only two ways credit card vendors 
can obtain permission to use table-
top marketing tactics on our campus. 
One of the methods many credit card 
companies use to target UCSD stu-
dents is setting up booths at quarter-
ly vendor fairs, which are managed 
by Student Affairs. 

"1 do not have a considered opin-
ion on the matter of a ban," said 
Joseph Watson, Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs. "However, my incli-
nation would be not to ban the solic-
itations as long as they follow cam-
pus regulations r(,garding outside 
groups on the campus and using 
campus facilities." 

The only other way credit card 
companies are allowed on campus is 
through the bookstore. Currently, the 
bookstore receives $50 or 5100 for 
each vendor that is located in front of 
the bookstore. According to lUrk, 
this fee just covers the expense of the 
tables and the staff required to set 
them up. 

"1 ~o not anticipate a change in 
any bookstore policy regarding cred-
it card marketing unless California 
State Legislation or University poli-
cies changes," Thrk said. "But I am 
interested in hearing what the stu-
dents think about this issue. We do 
not have any credit card solicitors 
booked for winter or spring, and we 
will not make arrangements with 
them until we hear what the stu-
dents think." . 

According to Thrk, the most fre-
quent type of vendors are those that 
offer a wide range of financial ser-
vices. Companies such as Wells Fargo 
and Citibank offer different types of 
incentives than those offered by cred-

it card companies. 
American Express offers both a 

credit card and a revolving charge 
card. With a revolving charge card, 
debt cannot accrue, as the payment is 

du~ every month. The primary focus 
of American Express' marketing is 
on the revolving charge card. 

Credit card companies are the least 
frequent type of vendor that works 
with the bOokstore. In addition, all 
credit card companies are limited to 
one campus visit per quarter. 

,.. ........... 
Fifteen yE'.ars ago, the first credit 

card vendors were allowed on cam-
pus because the bookstore benefited 
when more students had credit 
cards. Stuaents paying with credit 
carda would expedite lines at the 
bookstore because credit card trans-
actions are significantly faster than 
writing checks. 

However, recent advances have 
made several methods of payment 
faster. For example, char~ing book-
store purchases to one s student 
account is advancing in popularity. 
Simply by showing a student identifi-
cation, any bookstore pur-
chase can be billed with 
tuition. 

"We are the 
only UC campus 
to work with the 
Bursar's office SO 
that students can 
charge payments to 
their student 
accounts,". Turk said. 

With the increased 
popularity of debit 
cards, Triton Plus 
cards and the ability 
to charge items to a 
student account, the 
bookstore's need for 
students to have 
credit cards has cer-
tainly changed. 

"We are seeing 
several changes ir 
the method 01 pay 
ment for books," 
Turk said."On our 
[Web) site, medical 
school books can be 
purchased with a 
credit card. I antid-
pate that in the 
next sixth 
months, all 
books will be 
able to be pur-
chased from 
our Web site. 
The majori ty 
of these pur-
chases are made 
with credit cards." 

WhIIt Yo. May Not Know 
A Ithough the benefits of student 

credit are obvious, the drawbacks 
may not be so readily apparent. Each 
time a student applies for a new 
card, an inquiry into the student's 
credit will be shown on his or her 
credit report. A large number of 
inquiries into one's credit can poten-
tiall!,: be detrimental. 

, Oftentimes what students do not 
know when they sign up for a credit 
card is what exactly happens to their 
application .... They are just interest-
ed in getting a free gift," A.S. Presi-
dent Tesh Khullar said. "s t u -
dents are not told that this is an 
'inquiry' on their credit record. Too 
many inquiries in a short amount of 
time is actually bad for your credit. 1 
know this through first-hand experi-
ence. If students were told 
the whole story by 
these credit card 
agencies, then I 
would have no 
problem with their 
solicitation . 
The 
fa c t 

that the repre entatives for these 
credit card companies do not inform 
students of the entire story up ets 
me and has me leaning in favor of 
their removal from this campus." 

In addition, few students are 
aware lhat bad debt can potentially 
make it harder to get into graduate 
school and get employment. 

Probl •• w .... Studellt Credit 
Problems managing credit cards 

only grow as students accumulate 
more cards, more debt and obtain 
higher credit limits. 

"As I spent more and more, the 
credit card companies just kept raising 
my credit limit," Weifel said. "That 
just made me want to spend more."

Larger University Classes Hold Advantages 
Although large class sizes often take heavy criticism, they can be educationally beneficial 
By KIRSTEN G. STUDUEN 
Harvard Crimson (Harvard U.l 

(U-WI RE) CAMBRIDGE, 
Mass. - In chOOSing a college,' 
many students see the issue of 
class size as one of the most 
important determinants in their 
search for a fulfilling education. 

Most high schoolers and their 
parents assume that smaller class-
es necessarily translate into better 
teaching. 

And despite its undeniable 
prestige, Harvard has come 
under fire from outside 
observers, who charge the uni-
versity with an excess of larKe, 
impersonal lecture classes and 
inaccessible professors. 

But according to Harvard fac-
ulty members, the anonymity of 
large classes is offset by the teach-
ing ability of the engaging and 
charismatic big name professors 
who generally preside over big 
lecture courses. Because these 
professors are both talented and 
well-known, they draw more stu-
dents each time the class is 
offered. Many faculty members 

feel that it is unfair to bar stu-
dents from benefiting from such 
classes. 

"I hate it when anything is 
limited at Harvard," Dean of the 
Colle~e Harry Lewis wrote in an 
e-mail message. 

"It is so hard to get in to this 
place, all students should have 
access to everything without a 
further selection process, except 
of course by prerequisites and the 
knowledge needed to participate 
usefully." 

"Some courses are large," 
Dean of the Faculty Jeremy 
Knowles said. 

"I'm not 'going to legislate to 
say that a large number of stu-
dents can't enjoy a charismatic 
lecturer." 

But How ... Is t .. ..., 
The key to enjoying the most 

beneficial education at Harvard 
lies in finding the correct bal-
ance between large and smail 
classes. Large classes may be 
better known and therefore 
tempting to students, but a fuji 
load of courses taught in 

Sanders Theatre may leave some 
studen ts feeling lost in the 
crowd. On the other hand, stu-
dents who scrupulously avoid 
large lecture classes may never 
have the chance to be in a course 
taught by one of Harvard's acad-
emic superstars. 

The €ollege offers classes at 
both extremes, and in general the 
most ' satisfied students take 
advantage of both large and small 
classes. 

10M SIze ....., IIIItter? 
According to Harvard admin-

istrators, class size is not by any 
stretch the determining factor of 
what students can get out of a 
class. "I personally have never 
considered class size terribly 
important," Lewis said. 

"I may be a bit unusual in that 
regard. When 1 was a student, I 
had unforgettably wonderful 
classes of 400, where the effort 
involved in preparing lectures 
and course materials could not 
have been invested for a dozen 
students," he said. 

Dean of Undergraduate Edu-

cation William M. Todd III says 
that there is no "one size fits all" 
answer to the question of class 
size. 

"Classes in which students can 
feel they actively participate bet-
ter seize their attention and 
engage their minds," Todd wrote 
in an e-mail message. 

"But some of our professors 
have the rare talent to conduct a 
class of 1,000 as if it were a semi-
nar of 15." 

And it is not necessarily true, 
he added, that enrolling in a small 
course will ensure a stimulating 
classroom experience - poor 
teachers are poor teachers regard-
less of class size. 

For dedicated professors, the 
thought of facing an audience of 
hundreds two or three times a 
week can actually make them 
work harder. 

Because professors often feel 
that they need to put on a 'perfor-
mance' in class in order to keep 
students interested, presentations 
often come out more polished 
than they would in a small class 
setting. 

• Professor Everett I. Mendel-
sohn told The Crimson last spring 
that he spends time before every 
tecture preparing to give a first-
class show. 

Though other professors deny 
being nervous before class, 
Mendelsohn sees the preparation 
ritual as crucial. "I always take a 
half an hour before to get hyped 
up and get the adrenaline pump-
ing," he said. 

Lewis said that the bottom line 
on class size is that a Harvard 
education is what you make of it 
and does not hinge on whether a 
given class has 10 people or 1,000. 

"The point of an education is 
to become intimately familiar 
with the subject, not with the 
teacher," Lewis said. 

He said that in many cases, 
larger classes can be beneficial for 
students who may be less than 
chipper at 10 a.m. on a Monday 
morning. 

"I had a small, intimate semi-
nar with a senior faculty member

Marketing Services, the average 
student has 2.8 credit cards. The 
average undergraduate student 
has $1,843 in credit card debt, 
according. to Nellie Mae, a student 
loan proHJer. 

Robert Manning, of George-
town University's sociology 
department, believes that past 
studies have underrepresented 
the student credit problem. He 
estimates that one-fifth of stu-
dents have $10,000 or more in 
credit card debt. Furthermore, he 
argues that the true size of most 
students' debt is hidden because 
it gets refinanced with both stu-
dent and private loans. 

While Manning views the use 
of credit cards for loans as nega-
tive, many credit companies por-
tray this as a benefit of credit cards. 
According to Mastercard, "A cred-
it card can also provide a short-
term loan, either in the form of a 
cash loan or of merchandise pur-
chases. Of course, you'll have to 
pay the money back ... but you are 
able to do so in flexible payments." 

APr ... I .............. 
While the issue of student debt 

has not received much attention at 
UC5D, the issue is one of debate 
on several other campuses. More 
than 300 colleges nationwide have 
banned credit card marketers from 
their campuses. In addition, anoth-
er 140 plan to discontinue use by 
the end of this year. 

. "Oftentimes, things happen at 
UCSD without student input and 
I feel this is one of them. I have no 
real opinion either way on the 
issue, but I can see why they are 
being baJU\ed [at other schools)," 
Khullar said. 

Related legislation will be 
introduced in Virginia's General 

! Assembly to more closely regu-

puses. Utah State University'S

has discussed funding for a part-

sons: Everyone is afraid not to 
believe it and no one can prove it 
false. 1 mean the punishment for 
not believing isn't that severe. 
Etemal burning, sounds like great 
fun to me. And we all know that 
if enough people believe it, then it 
must be true. Look out at the 
horizon, doesn't the world seem 
flat to you? And I can't prove the 
good book false, but then again ... 
no one can prove me false either, 
so who is right? Me. 

I even want the Bible to be 
true. If 1 believe in God, I will live 
forever. Isn't that great? Wouldn' t 
it be great to live forever? Well, 

inspiration and hope. But most of 
all, it's a great way to give a pur-
pose or answer to anything and 
everything inexplicable. 

My argument is, if you're 
going to believe and follow the 
Bible, do it. It's all or nothing. 1 
hate people who are believing 
"just in case." What in the hell is 
that? Just in case God is only 
watching when you're in Sunday 
best? He knows when you've 
been bad or good, so be good for 
goodness sakes? It took me nearly 20 years to 

realize that I'm never getting into 
heaven. Hell? I'm not going there 
either. It's not that I'm so terribly 
bad that heaven will shun me or 
SO saintly that I would put out the 
fires in hell. It's just that those 
two places don't exist. 

While I am now an atheist, my 
bout with religion has been long 
and arduous. You may find some 
folly in my ways. 

So why am I an atheist? If i~s not obvious, let me extrapolate. I~s not merely 
that Pm anti-religion. To put it simply, I don)t believe there is a higher being. I 
don)t belicpe there is a son of a higher being. I don)t even believe tlie Bible is 
nonfiction. 

Call me stoical, but I am not 
afraid of death. I am happy 
knowing that when I die I will be 
absorbed by mother earth. I am 
spiritual in other ways. I don't 
need a creator or an afterlife. I'm 
not going to a place that doesn't 
exist. 

I'm not trying to persuade 
anyone away from the Bible or 
religion or God. I feel that most 
people are born into a religion 
and have it thrust down their 
throats from day one. Everyone 
should make up their own minds 
and not shun those who have a 
mind of their own. 

Born to a Jewish father, my 
family p'ca~ticed Judaism until I 
was four. The only scar is the one 
from the bris. I don't have any 
pictures of me wearing a skull 
cap, but ttvery little Jewish boy 
looks cool wearing a yarmulke. 

After several years without 
religion, since moving around 
starves any relationship with a 
church, I was forced to attend a 
Catholic church for a year or two, 
and then to rejoice at a nonde-
nominational Christian church 
for four. By choice, I sought ful-
fillment at a Methodist church for 
three years and toward the mid-
dle of high 1Choo1, attended sem-
inary at a Mormon church for 
nearly two. 

When I got to UCSD I went to 
the Methodist church in down-

if I wanted to devote my life to 
God. And then they'd proceed to 
ask me if 1 looked at pornogra-
phy, how often I masturbated, if I 
was a virgin, if had ever been 
drunk - all sins, you know. 

So why am I an atheist? If it's 
not obvious, let me extrapolate. 
It's not merely that I'm anti-reli-
gion. To put it Simply, I don't 

.believe there is a higher being. I 
don't believe there is a son of a 
higher being. I don't even believe 
the Bible is nonfiction. 

Now, while I can't explain the 
Creation of the universe, the theo-
ry of God seems the least likely, 
and the most likely to be conjured 
up by simple minds with no sci-
entific background. 

The Bibfe explains the unex-

man like Jesus lived, but was he 
the son of God? The Bible is a 
great story, an unbelievable one. 
(t is so powerful and great, who 
would want it not to be true? 

What else quells our wonder-
ment of the beginning of time? 
What other book explains our 
purpose so provocatively? What 
else in the world calms our fears 
of death by giving us hope of 
something afterward? 

Fear is a great emotion to har-
ness, and the Bible does it won-
derfully. Most people can't han-
dle thinking that once they die, 
that is it, it is done, existence is 
over, kaput. What would every-
one do if there were no afterlife? 
The world might seem quite use-
less, dim and meaningless. 

not really, but it seems great at 
first. I think you get pretty tired of 
everything once you start count-
ing your age in centuries, but it's 
a nice thought. . 

Oh yeah, bul there must be a 
creator, right? Well, who created 
the creator? Wait, you're saying 
that there's a God Sr.? Weir, 
where's his good book? Oh, he's 
not much of a writer. I see. 

I don't shun belief in a creator. 
Don't get me wrong. Believing 

in God or ~y other higher being 
and belonging 10 that deity~s reli-
gion is good for some people. It 
may even be good for the country. 
It's a great way to scare chlldren 
into being good and having 
morals. It encourages people to 
help those in need. It provides 

I don't believe in God. Does 
that make me a bad person? Am I 
lacking morals? No. However, 
when I do make decisions I am 
not blinded by sheer faith . Athe-
ism is not about believing noth-
ing it's about disbelieving. I 
believe God is a concoction and a 
great one. 

I am an atheist because I 
choose not to believe in that con-
coction. And no matter how 
many times you tell me I'm going 
to hell for this, J won't believe it is 
true. I'm not believing ... just in 
case.

You're looking good on Monday

want. You're more likely to eet a

a major theme on Wednesday and 
Thursday. Scrape your pennies 
together so you can sign up for a 
cruise or a college class - or both. 
Around Thursday, you should start 
feeling more secure, as the sun

however, you may find yourself fin-
ishing up a project on your own. A 
partner comes to your rescue 
around Friday. That day, and Satur-

commitment too. On Sunday, money especially if you can get a loved one 
comes your way through either a gift or two to help. 
or a good idea.

to study have to do with money. You

won't be able to travel well on those 
days, but a foreign connection could 
be quite profitable. Stick close to

CLASS SIZE:

hensible that I wish it had been 
bigger so I and my ignorance 
would not have been noticed so 
much," Lewis said. 

" I don't believe that class size 
makes as much difference to the 
quality of the education as other 
parameters do." 

Knowles said he agrees that 
very large classes in no way hin-
der students' ability to benefit 
from a productive leaming envi-
ronment. 

He says that instead of isola-
tion, a large class can provide a 
great way for students to have a 
common learning experience. 

"Once the audience has risen 
above about 100 or so, I don't 
think that the students' ability to 
learn is affected," Knowles told 
The Crimson last year. 

"It can become, instead, a 
vivid, shared experience. There is 
surely nothing intrinsically 
wrong with very popular lectur-
ers." 

ClMtnIck ... 
The one danger, Knowles said, 

is the possibility that certain 
groups of students may end up 
with a college career composed 
entirely of anonymous lecture 
courses. 

Especially for students who 
are science concentrators, he says, 
there is a legitimate concern that 
they will be stuck in larger than 
life classes for their entire time at 
Harvard. 

"I am more worried about 
individual stu~ts taking onJy 
large classes,"Knowles says. 

Because of a phenomenon that 
Knowles terms 'verticality,' sci-
ence concentrators must take 

Tuesday. January 18. 2000 

many more prerequisites before 
they can advance to smaller class-
es. 

Conversely, English and histo-
ry c1asaes are more likely to be 
based on a topic student will not 
have been reqUired to have any 
prior knowledge of. as a prereqw-
site for the class. 

Todd says that this can prove 
to be a disadvantage to students 
mired in introductory science 
courses, because they lose out on 
some of the benefits of the bal· 
ance between class sizes. 

"The great majority of our 
COUI1leS here have enroDments of 
fewer than 20," Todd said. 

"The largest courses, however, 
are' concentrated in bur most 
populous concentrations and in 
the Core, so that students in these 
concentrations do not benefit 
from the many opportunities we 
offer for small group ,instruc-
tion." 

'IIIe Jor of ....... 
One of the ways professors 

can compensate for larger classes 
and ensure that students can still 
synthesize the material in a small 
learning environment is through 
section discussion. 

A disadvantage of large lec-
ture classes is the ease with which 
students can sleep in, skip class 
and choose alternate activities 
over learning. 

Todd said that the mandatory 
decrease in section size is one 
way in which the faculty has tried 
to combat the growing of class 
size. 

"With [class size] in mind, 
we reduced discussion section 
sizes from 20 to 18 two years 
ago," Todd said. 

"And once we have settled 
into this size we would probably 
like to make another reduction, 
perhaps to ]5." 

Todd feels this will keep stu-
dents in class and learning.

likes, hobbies, and beliefs. 

Creating a personal home-
page is so easy that someone 
with minimal computer training 
can make one. Many publish 
online diaries and photos of 
themselves, others attempt 
humor, and some are so odd 
that they defy description. 

This is where Losers.org 
(http://www./osers.org) comes in. 
With the sole purpose of identi-
fying these Web sites and stand-
ing them up for public ridIcule, 
Losers.org is the bully of the 
internet. 

The setup of the site is simple 
- each Web site is placed with-
in a category, for example, 
'dorks,' 'freaks,' 'nerds,' 'punks' 
or 'players,' and given a ' loser 
rating' ranging from a l-L mild 
loser to the [are 5-L maximum 
loser award. Brief David Spade-
style insulting comments are 
made for each site and links to 

each site are provided. 
Losers.org may sound mean 

spirited, immature, and hypo-
critical. It is. After all, devoting 
an extensive Web site to jibing 
others should qualify Losers.org 
for its own award. While 
Losers.org is funny in itself, the 
actual sites it links to are where 
the real humor lies. 

An entire category is dedicat-
ed to those who use the internet 
to flaunt their sexual prowess, 
the players. "They spend every 
waking moment in the pursuit 
of sex. They think they're God's 
gift to women. And they usually 
don't get any." 

A 3-L winning site offers a 
$]0,000 reward for anyone who 
introduces the creator 10 a 
woman who will become his 
wife. 

Losers.org tells it's victims, 
"All we are doing is putting up 
a link to your page - which 
you have made available to 
everyone completely of your 
own free will - and adding a 
few smarmy comments." And 
the result is the freakiest and 
least predictable site on the 
Web.

HOROSCOPE: 
Capricorn, Aquarius, 
Pisces and birthdays 
ConIIRued from ~. 13 
prevent much of a journey on Friday 
and Saturday, but dinner with a for· 
eign flare is mandatory. Be ready for 
an inspection on Sunday. A critical 
friend will be glad to point out what· 
ever you've missed. 

CAPRICORN 
Dec. 22 - jan. 19 

On Monday and Tuesday, the 
focus is paperwork. Rnlsh as much 
as you can now, or it'lI be even more 
of a problem later. On Tuesday and 
Wednesday, a partner comes to your 
rescue. Let him or her bail you out of 
a jam and be sure to show your 
appreciation. On Thursday, the sun 
goes into Aquarius, shifting your 
focus to financial matters for the 
next few weeks. Do long-range plan-
ning on Friday and Saturday. Sun-
day's your best bet this week for a 
romantic excursion or a visit with 
loved ones. 

AQUARIUS 
jan. 20 - Feb. 18 

Love and duty are at odds on Mon-
day and Tuesday. Fit in as much time 
as you can for the former, but don't 

ignore the latter altogether. That 
won't even be possible on Wednes-
day and Thursday. Duty definitely 
takes precedence then. Around 
Thursday, your life starts getting eas-
ier, as the sun goes into your sign. 
Form partnership agreements and 
make big decisions on Friday and Sat· 
urday. Sunday's your best this week 
for shopping. You're more liable to 
care about saving money then. 

PISCES 
Feb. 19 - March 20 

You 're in for a few surprises on 
Monday and Tuesday. The truth 
could come out about your boss, 
your company or your Industry. 
You ' ll do fine. so don't worry. 
Wednesday and Thursday are your 
best days this week for a romantic 
interlude. Those are also good days 
for relaxing with good friends and 
being around children. You won 't 
have time for any of that on Satur· 
day and Sunday. The pressure's on , 
and you'lI have to work hard to meet 
expectations. Try something differ-
ent with your favorite partner on 
Sunday, just for the fun of it. You'll 
have earned a reward by then. 

BIRTHDAYS 
jan. 1 7 - jan. 23 

If You 're Having a Birthday This 
Week ... 

Jan. 17: Work's your middle

name, and virtue's your reward. You 
might make a dream come true. 

Jan. 18: You'll be thinking more 
about money. and that could be 
quite profitable. Make up your mind. 

Jan. 19: A legal matter requires 
attention, but all turns out well. Put 
your money where your mouth is . 

Jan. 20: Hopes and dreams, 
money and partnerships. With good 
planning. success is within your 
grasp. Do the homework. 

Jan. 21: You 're powerful this 
year, but a gOOd partner will make 
you even stronger. Learn from a crit· 
ic. 

Jan. 22: Your visions can be put 
into words, and then anything can 
happen. You might even help pro-
duce a miracle or two. 

Jan. 23: Don 't spend more than 
you can afford, though.

CYCLISTS: 
Armstrong faced 
challenges in '99 

very exciting watching the 
women's soccer team take out 
China in the World Cup finals 
this year. It was especially 
exciting after watching their 
male col!nterparts fall on their 
collective face the prior sum-
mer. Even though the press 
couldn't get enough of Brandi 
Chastain's sports bra, I feel 
that Armstrong's story is con-
Siderably more incredible and 
worthy of much more merit 
that the women's soccer team 
did . 

This year, Lance' 
Armstrong became only the 
second American cyclist ever 
to win cycling's greatest 
event, the Tour de France. Not 
only did Armstrong win the 
event, but he was ahead for 
pretty much the entire race 
and by the end, built an unbe-
lievable lead over his pur-
suers. 

In- addition to having to 
deal with the European 
cyclists, Armstrong had to 
deal with the much maligned 
European press. It was obvi-
ous from the start that the 
press was looking for a nega-
tive story at the 1999 Tour de 
France. When it started to 
become evident that there 
would be nothing to write 
about, they began to make up 
stories about Armstrong 
involving drug abuse and ste-
riod use. 

Through it all, Armstrong 
let his first-class cycling, along 
with his drug test results, 
which came out negative 
every time, speak for them-
selves. 

This alone mabs this story 
worthy of taking the year's top 
spot, but we haven't even got-
ten to the most compelling por-
tion of Armstrong's story yet. 

Last year, and before the 
Tour de France, Lance 
Armstrong was diagnosed 
with cancer. He was given a 50 
percent chance of living and 
was told that he would never 
again be able to return to the 
sport he loved. ith the pre-
serverance that he, no doubt, 
learned through cycling, he 
was able to beat the disease 
and ascend to the pinnacle of 
his sport. 

The achievement of the U.S. 
women's soccer team did 
deserve merit, but we should-
n't forget that they were the 
favorMes to win the World Cup 
in 1999. Armstrong wasn't 
even the faV'Orite in his fight 
against cancer. It isn't very 
often tha a sports figure tran-
scends sports wi th an accom-
plishment. For that feat, 
Armstrong deserved to win 
the Sportsman of the Year 
honor from Sports 1I1ustrated. 
Winning that award could not 
compare to winning the race, 
or winning the battle for his 
life. 

KICKER: . 
Christie at fault for 
playoff debacle 

three consecutive Super Bowls 
that the Bills played in (one vs. 
the Washington Redskins and 
two vs. the Dallas Cowboys, in 
that order). 

There were no kicking misfor-
tunes in these games other than 
the first case, but last Saturday's 
torture was the latest example of 
how one guy on the team can put 
coaching staffers through the roof, 
making them wonder if their posi-
tioqs will be in jeopardy come 
next season's training camp. 

True, the whole team and not 
just Christie screwed up from the 
point of the kickoff until the end 
zone celebrations of Kevin Dyson 
and the Titans. However, the 
gloomy mood that ensued on the 
Bills' sideline after the touch-
down should have been directed 
toward the kicker and not toward 
every Bills player and coach. 

The bottom line: He should 
have squib kicked it! What an 
idiot. 

Watching this game from 
home, I was astounded at what 
transpired with 16 seconds left on 
the clock. I t seemed that the Bills 
all but had the game locked up 
after Christie's field goal. 

At this point, I was thinking to 
myself that the Bills. who still 
have Thurman Thomas and 
Bruce Smith (who were both on 
all those Super Bowl teams 

The UCSD Guardian 

through the early '90s), might 
have another shot at it. 

When the Bills have made it to 
the postseason with these experi-
enced vets, it always seems that · 
this team could adopt a higher 
standard of play. It looked as 
though that was the case for 
almost 60 minutes as Buffalo 
came into the Tennessee game as 
underdogs and kept the score 
even for most of the contest. 

nating in their brains. Thomas 
and Smith should be used to liv-
ing with this sort of agony by 
now. Key players assume much of 
the burden in situations like 
these. They wonder what more 
they could have done for their 
team. They wonder if the out-
come would have been the same 
if they had just rushed the offen-
sive line harder or if they had just 
made a few more catches on third 

Christie should by no means be castigated by his 
teammates and coaches, but he should assume most 
of the burden for the loss. 

But then the same old Buffalo 
Bills horror show followed. 

So instead of blaming the 
squandering of a well-played 
game and a ~Iutch field goal on 
inadequate kick-return coverage, 
I choose to levy the blame onto 
the kicker himself. Also, if there 
was a special team's coach who 
told Christie to kick the ball in the 
air to allow a return, thereby 
being responsible for ruining 
what would have been a more 
than satisfying weekend for his 
team and its fans alike. 

I would like to teU him that he 
should feel guilty too. In addi-
tion, if the decision ultimately lay 
in the hands of Head Coach Wade 
Phillips, I think he deserves a 
chewing out by the media and by 
the Bills' front office. 

The Bills must now be forced 
to endure a long off-season with 
the thought of this mistake mari-

down. 
Such a mindset is typical of 

star players after a loss of this 
magnitude. If I were one of the 
Bills going home to watch the rest 
of the playoffs from home, my 
perspective would be. one that 
adheres to evident relationships 
between cause and effect. In this 
case, the question of who was 
responsible for the Bills' loss can 
be pinned down to their kicker. 
No one else deserves to suffer the 
blame. 

Christie should by no means 
be castigated by his teammates 
and coaches, but he should 
assume most of the burden for 
the loss. That way, there is less 
finger pointing at players who 
had nothing to do with the final 
16 seconds of the game. 

Maybe Christie should give 01' 
Norwood a call and ask him how 
he dealt with failing to connect 

SPORTS I~ 

for the game-winning field goal 
in Super Bowl XXV. In any event, 
you have to give a kicker in the 
NFL some credit for the bitter-
sweet nature of hi occupation. 

Unfortunately for their reputa-
tions with us fans, we seldom 
have any memory of game-win-
ning moments. 

Most are of long field goals 
kicked during the course of a 
game when the score didn't mat-
ter so much as the shock of kick-
ing the ball through the goal 
posts from a monstrous distance. 
For instance, Jason Elam kicked 
one from 63 yards and Morton 
Anderson from 61. Elam's field 
goal was at the end of the first 
half of a game while Anderson's 
was while he was on the Saints-
a team that wasn't hoping for 
anything except not being tarred 
and fea thered ou t of New Orleans 
because they suck. 

The ones we can recall are the 
muffs like Norwood's in the 
Super Bowl and former Kansas 
City Chief Lin Elliot whose miss 
vs. the Indianapolis Colts allowed 
them to advance to the AFC 
Championship game thereby tar-
nishing then Head Coach Matty 
Schottenheimer's reputation . 
Gary Ande.rson, another 
Minnesota Viking, was perfect 
from field goal range during the 
regular season but then botched 
one at home, giving the Atlanta 
Falcons an astonishing Super 
Bowl appearance. 

All in all, kickers do deserve 
the blame in these si tuations - if 
only for the fact that others on the 
team don' t. 

Swim Team Unbeatable in Div. III Challenge 
DOMINATION: Both the men and women flourish ag~st Redlands, Claremont-Mudd and Pomona 
By ROBERT RJLTON 
Associate Sports Editor 

After weeks of competing 
against and hanging tough wIth 
Division I teams and other capa-
ble nemeses, the swim team 
dominated teams from a more 
level playing field at the 
Division III Challenge at home 
on Saturday. 

"We 8Wam pretty well," said 
Triton Head Coach Scott 
McGihon. "We swam about 
where I thought we'd be." 

Of the four teams involved, 
not one came close to dominat-
ing the Tritons. The women fin-
ished with a score of 119. 
University of Redlands finished 
second with a score of 71 while 
Claremont-Modd and Pomona-
Pitzer tied for third with scores 
of 54 each. 

On the men's side of the 
action, UCSD alst> dominated 
with a winning score of 102. 
Pomona-Pitzer finished second 
with a 61, Claremont-Mudd 
scored a 57 for third place and 
Redlands brought up the rear 
with a score of 54. 

The Triton women came out 
on top in a ll 13 of the events while 
the UCSD men finished first in 
eight events and second in the 
other five. 

In addition to the win, UCSD 
set six meet records. 

On the women's side, the team 
of Jennifer Watanabe, Rebecca 
Ranold, Sarah Brainard and 
Amanda Gurnee set a meet 
record in the 4OO-meter medley 
relay with a fantastic time of 
3:57.92 . . 

Gurnee joined forces 
with Evelyn 
Kwok, Sharon 
Smith and 
Samantha 
Wong to set a 
meet record in the 400-
meter freestyle relay with a 
time of 3:34.50. 

A time of 2:06.65 by Wata'\3be 
set a meet record in the 200-
meter backstroke while Sandra 
Lopez: had a time of 2:22.86 for a 
meet record in the 200 breast 
stroke. 

Watanabe had another victo-
ry in the 2oo-meter individual 
medley with a 2:10.75 while 
Smith added two more wins, 

comin~ first i the SOQ-meter 
free style with a time of 5:16.56 
and in the 5O-meter free style 
with a 24.32. 

Gurnee added a win with a 
time of 24.32 in the 5O-meter free 
style while Kwok also had an 
additional win in the 100-meter 
free style with a 53.31. 

Angela Juran scored two victo-
ries, coming first in the one-meter 
diving and the three-meter diving 
competitions. 

Jamie Rubio had a win for the 
Tritons in the 200-meter butter-
fly with a time of 2:13.31 and 
Keri Wilson timed a 10:56.16 to 

take the lOOO-meter free 
style event. 

tory. 

As for the 
men, they 
scored two 
meet records 
en route to vic-

The team of Mark 
Latronica, Matt Payne, Luke Seed 
and Danny Fisher combined to 
score a meet record in the 400 
medley relay with a time of 
3:32.95. 

Latronica and Fisher teamed 
th Rusty Jones and oss 

Russon to time a meet record 
with a 3:13.27 in the 400-meter 
freestyle relay. 

Payn dded a victo\}' in the 
ZOO-meter breast stroke with a 
time of 2:13.22 and Dagart Allison 
took the 1000-meter free style 
with a 10:01.44 

Matt MacDonald and Daniel 
Wong each scored two victories. 

MacOonald's times took both 
the one-meter and the three-
meter div while 

Wong's times of 1:58.20 and 
1:58.64 in the 200-meter back 
stroke and 200-meter individual 
medley, respectively, earned him 
two victories. 

The men also had five second 
places finished to fill out the 
evening. 

"The meet was all about sec-
ond place," McGihon said of 
UCSD superiority. "I think every-
one was aware to that fact ." 

With only a home meet against 
California Baptist and the 
University of Hawaii left and 
competition falling by the way-
side, UCSD is preparing for the 
conference final and then the 
NCAA championships. 

Not all of UCSD's members 
have qualified for the NCAAs, 
but the team hopes to change that 
in the near future. 

"Our conference meet start& in 
three weeks," McGibon said. 
"We're the defending champs. 

'bur first goal is to qualify as 
many people for the NCAAs as 
possibre. It's different from team 
sports : We definitely want to win 
but we would like to take a full 
team to the NCAAs." 

The Tritons head back into the 
pool on Jan . 28 when they host 
California Baptist and the 
University of Hawaii at Canyon 
View Pool.

The UCSD women's basket-
ball team maintained its winning 
ways this weekend as it stormed 
past Chapman University 88-62. 

UCSD is now running at full 
speed, ~ving finally recovered 
from many early injuries. With 
the team once again at almost full 
strength, the future looks danger-
ous for Triton opposition. 

"Everybody is back," 
Assistant Coach Stacey 
Patsko said. 
" Kat 
Turnbull is 
back at 100 
percent. Kim Neal is 
back at about 80 percent. 
Renee Hudec had a strain but 
played fine and Marci Ernsberger 
came back from a stress fracture 
to her femur but played for 15 
minutes." . 

The Tritons had many high-
light machines on the court Friday 
during the convincing win. 

Genevieve Ruvald and Natalie 
Beaver -each scored 15 points to 
lead the home team. Ruvald 
added six rebounds and five 
assists to her 15 points while 
Beaver tossed in three rebounds 
to compliment her scpring. 

The points didn't stop there as 
UCSD had five women achieve 
double-digit scoring figures. 
Mindy Misawa scored 13 points, 
as well as three rebounds and two 
assists. 

Triton teammates Ashley 
Kokjohn and Kimberly Neal con-
tributed 11 points each. Neal 
grabbed seven rebounds while 
Kokjohn pulled down five boards. 

Of the Tritons' 12 players, 10 

scored in the blowout. 
"We have a reall~ balanced 

team," Patsko said. 'No one is 
selfish. We distribute the ball to 
whoever is open. They all work 
hard and they all do a great job." 

In its losing effort, Chapman 
was led by a stellar perfo~nce 
from star center April i\beyta. 

Abeyta scored 22 points, but 
even more amazing was her lO-
II shooting from the field and 

her 2-2 foul shooting effort. 
Abeyta also pulled 

down eight rebounds and 
dished one 
assist while 
also garner-
ing a steal in 

just 29 minutes of play. 
"She is their best play-

er," Patsko said. "We knew 
that she would get her points, but 
if you control the rest of the team, 
she can't win it by herself." 

The game was relatively dose 
early on and UCSD was up by 
only nine points at half time as 
the score was 39-30. 

In the first half, Chapman 
shot well from the floor with a 
.524 shooting percentage. In the 
second half, that percentage fell 
to a dismal .367, and the game 
slipped away. 

UCSD went on a tear in the 
second half, scoring 49 points 
while it 's defense stepped up to 
hold Chapman to 32 first-half 
points for the 88-62 win. 

"I think we came out with 
increased intensity," Patsko said. 
"The Chapman game is always big 
for us. We had a week off and had 
to get back into it. In the second 
hall we really got into the game." 

The Tritons next host UC Santa 
Cruz this Friday at 7 p.m.

Men's Volleyball Season Gets Underway 
ROAD tRIP: Trip to the north opens 2000 with win over UC Santa Cruz, losses to Stanford and UOP 
By BRIAN WELlES 
Associate Sports Editor 

As the UCSD men's volleyball 
team began its season in Stockton 
against teams that have presented 
legitimate threats, the Tritons 
managed to squeak out wins in 
their opening three games of the 
season. 

University of Pacific 
defeated the Tritons, 15-
8, 15-12, 15-10, 
at the Mountain 
Pacific Sports 
Federation on 
Jan. 13. On Jan. 14, 
Stanford defeated UCSD, 15-
3, 15-10, 15-3. The Tritons had 
their first victory against 
Division 1 opponent UC Santa 
Cruz in four sets, 15-12, 10-15, 
15-6,15-7. 

Against the University of 
Pacific last Thursday, the Tritons 

~de 10 errors during their first 
two sets despite fine play on the 
offensive end. Pacific, however, 
only made six errors. 

In the first set, Pacific had 15 
kills, as the Tritons had, but only 
hit the ball out of the court three 
times for a .571 hitting percent-
age, as-opposed to the liitons' 
percentage of .167. In the second 
set, Pacific nailed 18 kilJs while 
UCSD made 17. 

Junior Zack Hite led the way 
for UCSD with 19 kllls, the most 

by any player in the game against 
Pacific. Raffi Mitillan, Chris 
Mortimer and Earnest Yun also 
contributed 17 of the Tritons' 
points in the match. 

Stanford's match held more 
heavy competition for UCSD, 
resulting in a loss for the liitons. 
With the exception of the second 

set, the Tritons were 
outscored, only manag-
ing three points in the 

first and third 
sets. Stanford 
was superior in 
all three sets in 

terms of the hits the team 
made. 

In the second set, when the 
Tritons scored 10 points on 19 
kills, Stanford remained strong 
with 24 points. Junior Donald 
Chen's performance distin-
guished him in the s~t column, 
making up for the bulk of the 
offensive effort with 14 kills and 
attempting 39 shots. 

Despite the 0-2 status, the first 
two matches against tough op~ 
nents can be seen as good prepa-
ration for playing within the 
Tritons' own division. 

"We struuled against UOP 
and Stanforo.- It wu early and 
they were the first matches of the 
season," Head Coach Ron Lanen 
said of his Tritons. "We were just 
trying to get our rhythm. " 

The team got wllat it expected 

against the Mount Pacific Sports 
Federation opponents. "We faced 
two good leams - you can't face 
the same kind of competition in 
practice," Larsen said. 

After a clinic t9n collegiate vol-
leyball, the threat of playing other 
strong teams subsided as the 
Tritons entered lut Saturday's 
match against Santa Cruz. 

Here, UCSD started off with a 
15-12 victory in the first game 
before falling in the second game 
15-10. The liitons took control for 
the first time during the weekend 
by running the show. Victories of . 
15-6 and 15-7, in the third and 
fourth sets, respectively, led 
UCSD to their first In of the sea-
son. 

In that winning game, Chen, a 
transfer student who came to 
UCSD in the middle of last sea-
son, tallied 19 IdlJs and 12 digs to 
lead his team to victory. Both of! 
these totals paced the Tritons in 
the match. 

Hite chipped in for the Tritons 
with 14 killS and also had two 
aces against the very capable 
Banana Slugs of Santa Cruz. 

Earnest Yun, who was used 
sparingly last season by former 
coach Jon Stevenson, had a break-
out game against the Banana 
Slugs. 

Yun had 12 kills and only com-
mitted thtee hitting errors, 
totalling a .409 hitting percentage. 
This percentage was the best on 
the team so far for this early sea-
son. 

At the least, UCSD did what it 
had to do In its first thiee games 
of the season to ensure some 
momentum that will carry them 
to more victories 

The Ie88OI\ will continue with 
against Mountain Pacific ~ federation rivals Long 

Bead('State University and the 
University of Southern California. 
The same against Long Beach is 
tonight at RlMAC arena at 7 P.M.
