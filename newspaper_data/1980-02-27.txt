The wont of the bad weather which hal 
ravaged Southern California the Ialt few 
week. i. over, for thil year at least, according 
to a Scripps scientist. 

Dr. Jerome Namiaa, head 01 Scripps 
Inltitution of OceanographY'1 Climate 

. Research Group, baa IUcceufuUy predicted 
weather condition. in recent yearl, utilizing, in 
part, data on ocean water temperature I as 
indicaton for changel in climate over the 
continents. 

Lalt November, Narnial released a report 
accurately predicting that precipitation would 
be unusually high in Southern California thil 
winter, and we would experience a colder and 
wetter winter aeaaon. 

Predicting the exact time stonns will occur 
il beyond Narniaa' capabilitiel, he saYI. 

"We do not predict apecific periods for 
.tonnl. We try to predict the general 
character of the winter in different parts of the 
country: whether it is going to be cold or 
warm, relative to nonn8J or nonnal; whether it 
is going to appreciably wetter than nonnal, 
drier than nonnal or normal. We are not able 
to predict in detail, either in time or apace," 
Namias saYI. 

But Namias believel the recent ltonnl wiD 
lOOn give way to lOme nicer weather, and 
saYI it "il very unlikely that we wiD return to a 
pattern anything like the one we have been 

. . " expenenang. 
He explains that, as the nonnal aeaaonaI 

cycle continues, "It becomes increasinglr. 
unlikely to have such ltonn patterns. I don t 

think that there is any evidence for a 
continuation. There's not even any guar .... 
that next year wiD be ano~.er wet one, even 
though the Iut three have been wet." 

Namias claims that the southern California 
atorma this aeaaon originated from-nortt.n 
areas. "A lot of weather is c:ornint fram' 
.torms that are moving approximately &om 
weal to east, from north of the He ...... 
Ilianda eastward targeted on the California 
area. Those storms are ditplaced .... 1OUIh of 
their normal track, which is up near the Gulf of 
Alaska." 

This diaplacement, Namiaa saYI, iI 
auoc:iated with the "carrying current of 
we.terly winds." 

Namias aIao notes that the inlenlity of the 
Ilorm has been extreme and is clue, in part, to 
the effects of tropical air. The atorma -have 
been intense because they have picked up 
tropical air from the tropicl, which 01 course iI 

'very moi.t," he explaina. 
Narniaa also notes that the extreme 

changes in wat. temperature in area 01 the 
ocean over which the storm has paaaed have 
contributed to the severity 01 the atorma. 
"Warm water has been extending from 
California southweltward to Hawaii, and cold 
water has been Oankina that to the northweat.' 

"So, this adient of the temperature in the 
water, 1 ~ve, infIuencel the atmoaphere 
very rapidly and tells the atmosphere also to 
be cold in the northern parts and warm in the 
lOuth. This difference of ,radient in 
~rature is the thint that atorma feed on. 
They both develop and aIrengthen on that

A proposal to discourage ltudents from 
dropping after the fourth week of c1assel was 
delayed once again by the Academic Senate 
because the faculty body could not gather a 
quorum. 

Itudents keeping classes longer than neceuary 
have sparked the move for a change. 

But, a letter from the Associated Students 
which circulated at the meeting claiml that by 
"using data provided by the Registrar's Office, 
it il estimated that an average class lize 
decrealel by leu than 10 cent in the fifth

Letters 

Leftists Not Opposed by 
All Jews, Just Zionists 
Editor: 

" ... Tension between Campw Leftisb, Jews" was a very 
inaccurate headline for Eric Jaye', stOl'}' (Dailll Guardian, 
Feb. 25) about the showing of the film The Palesrinfan. by 
the Committee for World Democracy and the picketing of the 
movie by the Union of Jewilh Studenb. 

It is inaccurate, first of aU because there were at least as 
many Jewish students interested in seeing the movies as there 
were in the piclu:t line. Barry Hyman, one of the organizers of 
tbe fihn event - which drew more than 300 persons, Jewish 
and non·Jewi,h - spoke 8S a Jewish student before the film, 
but no quotations appeared in your story of his speech in favor 
of showing the Palestinian point of view on this campus for 
the fir.t time. It seemsht for Eric Jaye, Jews with different 
opinion. than thoae 01 the Zioniats, are not Jews but "leftists." 

A lao , it i. inaccurate to ~srni.. as anti·Semitism any 
ddenae of the rights of the Palestinian people. On the 
contrary, it is only through the recognition 01 the Palestinians' 
right of self-determination that a peaceful IOlution can be 
achieved in the Middle East for the benefit 01 both the Jewish 
and the Palestinian people.

-. Taiwan Gov't Fears FOrlJl0SanS The Daily' Guardian 
Editor: 

A rather bizarre eni{ant in 
&he Taiwan letter. controversy 

, in n.. Vailll Guardian is 
"Name Withheld by ReQuest" 
(Feb. 15). "Request" daims 
that the ~ent apate of arresb 
in Taiwan is .imply a 
aadcdown on "irresponsible 
diuidentl" in order to make 
the ialand aafe for the "Good 
G .... 

apolitical, interested o~y in 
protecting human right., 
regardleu of a particular 
government's political 
ideology. It has won the Nobel 
Peace Prize for its work. 

In its February, 1980 
newsletter, AI tells of mall 
arrests and physical abuse in 
Taiwan. AI says the 
government broke up a 
eeaceful rally of 15,000 on 
Dec. 10, and then uaed the 
rally as a pretext to arrest 
"most opposition figures," 
even those who had nothing to. 
do with the rally. 

On Dec. IS, says AI, 
Huang Hsin·chien, publisher 
of Formosa magazine and 
Assembly parliamentarian, 
was arrested on the Assembly 

only . for prilOners who have 
not practiced or preached 
violence. 

The fact is that Taiwan, 
after being occupied by 
Japanese forces, has suffered 
the rule of the · incredibly 
wealth, and autocratic Chiang 

Kai·~k family and their 
cronies since the Nationalists 
fled <lUna in 1948.

According to ReqUest, Shih 
Ming.teh, the principal 
diuident in question, and his 
cohort, are a bunch of 
dangerous types with 
"suspicious intentions." 
They re trying to use the 
sympathies of innocent 
Americana for their nefarious . 
ends. Taiwan is really a 
wonderful, democratic place 
that a bunch of radicals want 
to disrupt. 

More objective sources tell 
a different ~tory . The Los 
Angeles Times (Feb. 20) says 
the Nationalist government 
cracked down ' beea us!" the 
opposition was having too 
much success. They had done 
very well in recent local 
elections; the circulation of 
Formosa magazine (of which 
Shih w~ a staff member) ha,t 
mushroomed; the government 
feared losing if legitima~ 
national elections were e~ 
allowed. SQ, according to ttiit 
Time. report, the government

floor. Others arrested included 
writers for another opposition 
magazine, The Eightie., and a 
physician '<Who was a witne .. 
against government atrocities 
at a trial two yean ago." Also 
under attack are Presbyterian 
Church members; Rev. Shu-
T'ien.hsien was arrested in his 
pulpit. 

The Nationalisls have 
maintained themselves since 
1948 on US aid and military 
might and the myth that they 
would someday return to take 
over the mainland. Now that 
the US has thrown in with 
"Red" China against the 
USSR, the Nationalists' 
paranoia has b1ollOmed, as 
they struggle to hold on to the 
island of which they make up 
only 14 percent of the 

po~lation. 
The Taiwanese have never 

been comfortable with the 
Nationalist presence, and a 
look at another source gives a 
hint why. This is from a book 
published in 1962 by William 
J. Lederer, a former naval 
officer and the furthest~~ing 
from a radical; he was 
concerned that the US was 
losing out to "the Reds" by 
backing too many unpopular 
and unstable dictatorships.

Brown's Rating by 
Californians Down 
. SAN FRANCISCO - displeased in pari by Gov. 

Edmund G. Hrown's presidential campaign, Califomians 
have handed their leader his lowest job rating ever, according 
to the California poD released yesterday. 

Nearly two out of five rated Brown as a "poor" or "very 
poor" governor in a survey of registered voter. conducted by 
Mervin D. Field. 

When asked what they thought 01 Brown'. efforts to move 
into the White House, 54 percent of thoae polled 
disapproved, and 37 percent approved. Neutral re.ponses 
accoooted for 9 percent of those surveyed. 

Brown's favor hal dipped dramatically since a poll taken in 
November, 1975, when half those surveyed thou~t Brown 
was doing an excellent or good job. In this month. poU, 22 
percent gave him thie highest rating, while 38 percent 
described his perfonnance as fair and 38 percent called it 
poor or very poor. No opinions were expreued by 2 percent. 

In November 1975, only 7 percent gave Brown theloweat 
grade, while 34percentsaid hi. performance was fair and 9 
percent didn't have anything to say. 

FJeld dfered high and low ratin.g. for Brown'. predeceuor 
Ronald Reagan and former governor Edmund Brown Sr., 
father of the c..-rent governor. 

The hiJhest percentage of "poor" opinion rating received 
by Reagan in • FJeld poll was 33 percent in Aquat 1971, 
while his strongest "excellent" mark wai 42 percent in' 
February 1969. The elder Brown was rated excellent by 23 
percent of thote polled in October 1963 and his total 
favorable rating dipped to the lowell. 32 percent in March 
1961. 

Brown would do better as a US Senator than as,overnor, 
in the.mind. of tho. poled. Brown would be an Uexcellent" or 
"good" senator, saicl43 percent of thole queried, ww. 26 
percent said he would be "poor" or "very poor." 

The poD found that Brown would be favored, 51·34, over 
Republican Sen. S.I. Hayakawa if the two were pitted in a US 
Senate race.

Carter -and Reagan-Top. New Hampshire 
, 

Kennedy Optimistic Abo_ut Primaries_ t~ Come; Dole Drops Out of Race 
CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -

President Carter defeated Sen. Edward 
Kennedy in New HampshIre's 
presidential primary election last night, 
but the Democratic challenger 
conceded nothing. Ronald Reagan 
won the Republican primary in a 
landslide over George Bush, and 
reclaimed command of the race for the 
GOP nomination. 

Kennedy, in what amounted to a 
celebration of defeat, told cheerinal 
IUppOI1ers that hi. ~paign iuues wiD 
take hold in the bit induatrial states to 
come. 

With almost ~5 ~cent of the vote 
counted, Carter had half the vote, and 
led Kennedy by a comfortable 12 
perc:entqe poinu in a primary that 
eftW a a.;ge voter turnout. 

Carter's triumph was mqnified by 
the fad dar it came next door to 
Kennedy's own Maaac:huaetts. It was 
the third defeat Carter had ... t 
Kennedy, who baa yet to win a 
........... c:an..,.ip coniat. 

And it left Kemedy at the brink of 
DOIiIicaI coI..- with no place to go 
but home, to the Maaaachuaetta 
primary one week away. 

With 94 percent of the precinct. 
CDUnted, Democratic returns showed: 

c.ter 48,433 or 49 percent. 
Kenn.iy 37,385 or 38 percent. 
CalifornIa Gov. Edmund G. Brown 

Jr. 9,636 or 10 percent. 

Two minor candidates got scattered 
support. 

That translated into 10 Democratic 
nominating votes for Carter, 9 for 
Kennedy. In previous contests in Iowa 
and Maine, Carter had gained 45 
nominating votes to Kennedy's 27. 

In the Republican contest: with 93 
percent of the precincts counted, it was: 

Reagan 66,136 or 51 percent. 
Bush 29,263 or 23 percent. 
Sen. Howard Baker Jr., 16,626 or 

13 percent; Rep. John B. Anderson of 
IUinoi., 12,775 or 10 percent; Rep. 
Pltilip Crane of Illinois 2,287 or 2 
percent, and former Texas Gov. John 
Connally 1,965 or 1 percent. 

Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas was dead 
last, with 530 vote., and he virtually 
dropped out of the race, saling he will 
enter no more primarie.. 'Obviously 
there's not much of a campaign out 
there," Dole said in Washington. 

former Preaident Gerald R. Ford 
had 348 write·in votes. 

The New Hampahire results put 
Reagan in the lead for 15 of New 
Hampahire'. GOP nominating votes, 
Bush had 5 and Baker 2. Bush went 
into New Hampshire with 17 
delegates, Reagan with 9, Baker with 5 
and Connally with 1. 

New Hamp.hire Republicans gave 
Ronald Reagan hi. victory Tuesday 
because he .hares their conservative 
phiJoaophy and their stand. on key

issues, an Associated Press·NBC 
News poll said. 

President Carter defeated his 
opponents in the Democratic 
presidential primary because New 
Hampshire voters said Americans 
should stand by their president in times 
of crisis and because they just couldn't 
vote for Sen. Edward Kenneday and 
California Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., 
the poll of Democratic voters said. 

The AP.NBC News poll, are based 
on interviews conducted outside polling 
places across New Hampshire with 
nearly I,BOO Republicans and 1,200 
Democrats. 

Reagan won the votes of 55 percent

Angry Triton Cagers Begin Playoffs Bedard' is 
Short but 
Consistent 

BY BARBARA HAAS 
Senior Staff Writer 

The varsity basketball team 
enters league playoffs 
tomorrow for the first time in 
five years. The team is seeded 
in sixth position in the NAIA 
District III, and they. tip· off 
against third seeded Azusa 

Pacific College Thursday 
night at 8:00 up at Azusa. 
Until 15 minutes before game 
time 250 seats are being 
reserved for Triton fans. Both 
the coaching staff and the 
athletes hope to have some 
support for the first round of 
post·season play.

Feelings about their bottom 
ranking, possible outcomes of 
the game and .crowd support 
run the entire range of emotion 
from indifference to raw anger. 
Head coach Ron Carter told 
his team in practice, "I'm mad. 
I'm mad that they seeded us 
sixth. And I want you to be 
mad too. We're going to go up 
there and' show them that 
we're mad." 

Starting Forward Stan 

we get a lot of people up there, 
we're going- to win for lUre." 

Azusa Pacific has a small 
gym, the type in which 50 
people yelling and cheering 
can sound tike 500. The last 
time the cagers played there, 
AI Winters said about the 
decibel level, "I was sitting 
down one time and, man, I 
was getting a headache from 
all the noise." 

Support from students and 

Playoff Carpools 

One of the smallest 
members of the varsity 
basketball team is also one of 
the best. Dana Bedard, a 6' 
guard for the Tritons, leads the 
team in scoring (8 15.4 point 
average in the last 5 league 
games) and is undisputediy the 
most consistent player. Coach 
Ron Carter said of him after a 
recent game, "Dana played a 
great game as usual. This f.Jy 
is 50 consistent it's unreal. ' A pep bus with 65 available leats and carpools are bema fonned for students who are interested in 

attending the UCSD basketbaU j)layoff game at 8 pm 
Thunday night in Azusa Pacific. Students ahould contact 
the Intercollegiate Athletic offace (x4211). 250 seats 
have been reserved. 

Bedard borders on the 
unreal in other aspects too. His 
body i. incredibly well built 
despite hi •• ize, and he makes 
full use of it on the court. n.e 
opposition is always aware of 
his tight defense and accurate 
outside shooting, And Bedard 
still remain. one of the better 
team {>layers. 

Hopper echoed Carter's 
sentiments. "I don't 
understand it. UCSD has been 
shown no respect around the 
league all year, but all that's 
going to change after the 
playoffs," he said. Dana 
Bedard who was less refIned, 
added, "If he's mad, then I'm 
fuckin'mad ." 

Anthony Filer, the key man 
in the last victory over PI. 
Loma a week ago, said "this 
will just give us more initiative. 
Us being seeded sixth will 
make us want to Win more. If 

fans seems to be a prime factor 
if the Tritons are to pull off a 
win. Seven of their twelve 
losses have come on the road, 
with an overall record a dismal 
5·7 . Winters added, "it's going 
to be tough, especially since 
it's on the road. Games are 
always tough on the road." 

Nate Forte, an aggressive 
5'8" guard from Lancaster, 
was more nonchalant about 
the contest. "It doesn't bother 
me that we're seeded la.t. 
We're in there at least. Hey-

, " a game s a game. 

Dana, a sophomore at 
Third CoUege, is one of the few 
veteran. on the team. He 
started out playing JV baD in

recruited by Barry Cunning.

Intramural Basketball Nets 1300'Students 
BY SCOlT AI I ISON 

StaH Writer 
This season's intramural 

basketbaU features lOme of the 
toughest competition in years. 
More than 1300 players 
competins on 173 teaml m;e 
now grinding it out to see just 
who will make the playoffs 

Hardballers Considered Favorite in AAA League 
they lack in ability with Jan 
enthusiastic "spirit.of.the. 
game" approach. 

next month and who wiU 
eventually win those elusive 
championlhips. 

In Men s AAA, the 
Hardballers seem to have 
emerged al the team to beat. 
The lIQuad features veteran 
Vince Askey and inside threat 
Denny Colson. 

"We could win the whole 
thing, but it's up to our 
defense," says Askey. 

The Hardballers could be 
challenged by once-beaten 
Double Drivel, or by the 
scrambling Three By Three 
squad. As the season winds 
down to.its waning weeks, play 
underneath the boards as well 
as defense will be the key. 

Traveling one small step . 
downward to men's AA, the . 
elite team just might be Inputs. 
Outputs, who boast an 
undefeated record in league 
competition. The best race in 
AA can be found in the 
Boilermaker 4.ague, where 
the Caps and EIdo'l Orchid 
are battling for the top spot. 
Capa' captain Joe RobinlOn, 
whose eagerl have fallen only 
once, appears - well -
confident. 

"When we're on our game," 
he says, "we can blowout any 
other AA team." 

Men'l AA a110 features the 
highelt scoring Iquad in 
intramwall, the CrOWl, who 
are averaging a record 70 
points a game. 

Now, when we begin to 
examine Men's A competi.

Bedard a Steady Veteran 
( '''"Ii"l/eel/rom I"'~l' S 
settled into a place on the varsity roster. Now 
he's a ltarting guard on the most successful 
team in the history of UCSD. 

Bedard, originally from Seal Beach and 
Los Alamitos High .chool, chose UCSD 
mainly because he was overwhelmed with the 
physical appearance of the school. "The firlt 
impression just blew me away," he said. 
"AIIO, I wanted to play, 10 I had to go to a 
small school becau.se there'l not that many 
places for a 6' guard. UCSD had a good 
location - it's not too close and not too far." 
. Since coming to UCSD, he's played under 
three different coaches in two yearl. It hasn't 
been difficult for him to adapt to the different 
Stylel. According to him a player must know 
how to judge the coaches in order to make a 
good impression. Bedard baa met with 
IUCCesl with this philosophy. 

During a game, Bedard's enthuaiaam at 
excep1ionally well executed plays (he's the 
perlOnification of the fast break) and 
impending victoriel is contagiously amusing. 
He leaps up and swati the air with hil filt, 
yelling his ·satisfaction in loud bursts of 

pleasure. It's exciting for the spectators to 
watch him in action. 

"It takes a lot of dedication to play 
intercollegiate athletics," he aaid. Bedard it 
frustrated at .the way UCSD hanclesathletics. 
"They don't," he said. For him, no reuon 
exists why the gym shouldn't be filled for home 
gamel. It'l difficult to win over a team that has 
school spirit behind it, and the problem of the 
lack of fans at the games has long befuddled 
the basketball team. The number of people 
attending the games has increased, however, 
almost in direct proportion with the increase in 
the Triton' I win·loll record. The eagers had a 
12-4 home record this season, which ended 
with lut Thursday'. win against Pt. Lorna. 

Although Dana puts in three to four boon 
of basketball each day, it's not the most 
important thing in hi. life. He also values his 
parents, his religion, his school work and his 
JOCial life. He's a student in Third CoIIee, 
working toward a degree in sociology. Ae 
intends to be a juvenile probation officer. 

"I like kids," he said, "and I want to help 
people. So this i. just a lojical choice."
