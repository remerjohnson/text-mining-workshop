A campus teach-in in Center Hall 
last night gave way to two hours of 
discussion on the university’s ongo-
ing budget crisis. Students, faculty 
and staff decried systemwide bud-
get cuts, student fee increases and 
employee furloughs.

Over 200 people 
attended the event, pack-
ing the seats and aisles of 
Center 119.

“I didn’t come here 
with a speech in mind, 
but I felt kind of inspired 
by how many people were 
in the room,” Thurgood 
Marshall College senior 
Coral Castillo said.

C o m m u n i c a t i o n s 
professor Brian Goldfarb 
spoke first, presenting a 
slideshow that detailed 
his predictions for the 
budgetart effects on 
UCSD. 

Goldfarb said he 
expects to see a reduc-
tion in library hours and 
resources, fewer days in 
the academic year, larger class sizes 
and waitlists, less course availabil-
ity and decreased faculty interaction 
with students.

Goldfarb also warned that budget 
reductions will soon lead to a drop in 
the number of students admitted to 
the university. 

UCSD’s admission rate has 
decreased 10 percent from last year. 

Goldfarb said this will also mean an 
increase in out-of-state admissions — 
which means fewer California high-
school seniors will be admitted to 
UCSD, along with other UCs and 
CSUs.   

“Basically, you’re going to be 
paying more for an education that 
is less than,” Carolan Buckmaster, 

president of the Union 
of Professional and 
Technical Employees 
San Diego chapter said.

Sociology profes-
sor Isaac Martin said 
part of California’s 
budgetary problem lies 
in the state’s constitu-
tion, which requires a 
two-thirds vote in each 
house to pass any tax 
increase.

“This means that 
if there is a hardcore 
majority of anti-tax peo-
ple, they can block any 
tax increase they want,” 
Martin said.

Martin added that 
California’s reluctance 
to tax real estate forces 
the state to draw rev-

enue from less reliable sources, like 
income tax — which fluctuates with 
the economy.

“Property-tax revenues cannot 
increase more than 2 percent per 
year,” Martin said. “Compare that 
with the fact that student fees can 
increase 32 percent in over two years.”

TRANSPORTATION DEPT. TO ASK STUDENTS FOR SHUTTLE FUNDS
By Yelena Akopian
News Editor

Major cutbacks could be dealth to the campus shuttle program if a 
$20 student fee referendum isn’t 
passed this year, claims UCSD’s 
Department of Parking and 
Transportation.

If approved by the A.S. Council 
and passed by students later this 

year, as is the hope of Director 
of Transportation Services Brian 

d’Autremont, the ref-
erendum would cre-
ate a new parking and 
transportation fee of 
$20 per student per 
quarter. The fee would 
increase by $5 every 

year for the next five years, eventu-
ally reaching $40 per student per 
quarter.

According to d’Autremont, the 
fee would generate $3,000,000 per 
year for the shuttle service by 2014.

D’Autremont said funds for 
shuttles have been dwindling ever 
since the department began put-
ting aside roughly $2 million per 
year seven years ago, in order to 
bring a deteriorating parking lot 
at Hillcrest Medical Center up to 

$0

The A.S. Council held its first press conference of the year on Oct. 12 in Price Center Plaza. Closely resembling a town-hall meeting, the event was intended 
to garner student input in a public setting. Though A.S. President Utsav Gupta — alongside Vice President of Finance and Resources Peter Beneshch, three 
campuswide senators and a handful of college-council representatives — attempted to field questions from students, audience participation was minimal. VP 
External Affairs Gracelynn West and VP Student Life Ricsie Hernandez did not attend.

building code by 2019. 
Without additional funding, 

d’Autremont said he would have cut 
shuttle services by about half — 
eliminating MTS bus routes 3,10, 
150 and 921 and reducing the fre-
quency of the Nobel, Arriba, Mesa 
and Hillcrest shuttle routes — in 
order to continue directing parking 
revenue toward the new structure.

These cuts would save $1,238,523 
annually and reduce ridership by 
approximately 730,000 passengers. 

“At this point, that’s as far as I’m 
willing to look,” he said.

Currently, shuttle services are 
funded by revenue from parking 
permits and citations. Last year, cita-
tions generated about $2 million for 
the department, while permit sales 
brought in about $5 million.

However, the department’s public-
transportation costs have significantly 
expanded since 2005, while parking 
revenue has stayed about the same. 
Funds from the referendum would 
bring the department’s overall annu-
al budget to over $24 million by its 
fourth year. 

D’Autremont said an alternative 

option would be to charge students 
on a pay-per-ride basis. He said 
he is hesitant to consider such a 
move, as it may discour-
age students from taking 
the shuttles at all — rais-
ing the number of cars on 
campus back up to their 
previous rates.

Assistant Director 
of Parking and 
Transportation Sam 
Corbett said that stu-
dents at UC Berkeley, 
UC Merced, UC Davis, 
UC Santa Barbara and 
UC Santa Cruz pay a fee 
for their campus shuttle 
services, similar to the 
one d’Autremont has pro-
posed — ranging from 
$13.13 per quarter at 
Santa Barbara to $110.66 per quarter 
at Santa Cruz. 

D’Autremont said the referen-
dum would give students an oppor-
tunity to participate in transporta-
tion decisions by appointing stu-
dents to a board, which would then 
coordinate in some yet to be deter-
mined way with the Transportation 

Policy Committee. 
He said members of A.S. Council 

on the board would have control 
over the shuttle system, 
and be able to decide 
which shuttle routes to 
add, eliminate or change, 
within the given budget. 

“I’m kind of an ideal-
ist,” he said. “I don’t worry 
about it at all because I’ve 
had very good experienc-
es [with student input].”

D’Autremont said the 
details of the referendum 
as students will see it 
before next year will be 
left up to the A.S. Council. 

A.S. President Utsav 
Gupta said the language 
of the referendum is still 
in its early stages, and that 

he is concerned the student board 
might not have enough oversight.

“If the referendum is providing 
only 20 percent of the overall bud-
get, is the board also responsible for 
the other 80 percent coming from 
Parking and Transportation?” he 
said. “They might not have that juris-
diction because they only represent a 

fraction [of the budget].”
Gupta said he is reluctant to sup-

port a referendum if it means rev-
enue from permit sales currently 
feeding the shuttle service are redi-
rected toward other university capi-
tal projects. 

“I would support a referendum 
that responsibly maintains or expands 
the service of our shuttle,” Gupta said. 
“If students put more money toward 
transportation, they should see some 
increase in services.”

However, a statement provided 
by the department said that if the 
fee referendum passes, parking-
permit revenue will in fact begin 
to go toward future capital projects 
such as replacing an aging shuttle 
fleet and a new East Campus park-
ing structure at La Jolla Medical 
Center

“We’re generating a long-term 
agreement for something that is just 
for a parking structure, so we need 
to be careful,” Gupta said. “When the 
parking structure is out of the picture, 
what happens to the money then?”

NEWS� THURSDAY, OCTOBER 15, 2009� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 3 

Buckmaster lectured on the effect 
of the cuts on staff in particular, 
claiming that the decisions made by 
the UC Board of Regents undermine 
union power. 

“We can do all these teach-ins as 
we want to,” Buckmaster said. “We 
need a step three and we need to 
make it a loud one.” 

Literature professor Dennis 
Childs said the budget cuts may ulti-
mately lead to less diversity among 
students.  He also said the university 

is slowly losing faculty members to 
furloughs and salary cuts.

“Hopefully, I won’t have to go 
elsewhere to get an adequate pay-
check for me and my family,” he 
said.

Three fourth-year students from 
the Saving UCSD Coalition also 
addressed the audience.  Revelle 
College senior Sam Jung said the 
American dream has become almost 
impossible to achieve.  Jung said the 
cuts have widespread impacts and 
are affecting all college students – not 

just those at UCSD.
Castillo discussed her difficult 

financial situation. As a freshman, 
Castillo’s Cal Grant of $7,000 covered 
her $6,000 tuition. However, Castillo 
said that, as a result of budget cuts, 
her grant was cut, and will leave her 
an estimated $30,000 in debt by the 
time she graduates in June.  

“College is no longer affordable,” 
Castillo said.

CHANCELLOR’S

On today’s agenda: budgets (read: long, number-heavy meeting until the wee hours 
of the morning). 

Armed with this knowledge, A.S. 
councilmembers took their time to 
arrive, trickling slowly into the third 
meeting of 2009-10. 

Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Penny Rue was first to address the 
council, informing councilmembers 
about a number of 
topics including stu-
dent fee increases 
and UCSD’s 50th 
anniversary celebra-
tion. 

Rue told coun-
cilmembers to 
“keep their eyes on 
the prize,” reminding them to focus 
on the bigger goals that need to be 
accomplished throughout the year. 

“Not everyone wants to be in 
representative government…I think 
of you guys as my colleagues,” Rue 
said. “There’s nothing that Student 

Affairs wants that can 
be achieved without 
student leaders.” 

VP Finance and 
Resources Peter 
Benesch introduced 
University Events 
Office Business 

Manager Kristen Fernandez, who 
tried to explain the complexities of the 
A.S. budget. 

“There’s been confusion about 
how our money is handled, and we’re 
getting lost in the order of debate,” 
Benesch said. 

Fernandez cleared up much con-
fusion about Mandate Reserves and 
where A.S. revenue comes from. 

Following the presentation, 
Speaker James Lintern reminded 
councilmembers to be respectful and 
refrain from texting or surfing the 

Internet during the meeting. 
President Utsav Gupta rounded 

out the special presentations by 
explaining the 2009-2010 executive 
budget, which included stipends for 
members of his office staff — a few of 
whom came in and introduced them-
selves to the council.  

And then, the moment everyone 
had been waiting for: the budget! 

Councilmembers dissected spe-
cific wording 
and allocation 
amounts for vari-
ous organizations 
and events within 
the budget. The 
six Bear Gardens 
held each aca-
demic year 

warranted one of the night’s longer 
discussions.

“Do we really need an event where 
alcoholic beverages are served that 
you can enjoy on your own?” Arts and 
Humanities Senator Omar Khan said. 

Benesch said the Bear Gardens 
are a way to reach out to junior and 
senior students, who normally don’t 
see a reason to return to Student Life. 

“Beer brings them back in good 
numbers,” Benesch said. 

AVP Diversity Affairs Jasmine 
Phillips asked for more than the 
$1,000 A.S. had allocated for diversity 
programming. 

“$1,000 shows that A.S. doesn’t 
care,” Phillips said. 

The Council then voted to increase 
the amount of funds allocated to 
diversity programming to $5,000.

Next, debate ignited over whether 
or not to provide $4,000 in additional 
funds to Triton Tide for fireworks on 
Spirit Night, or if the funds should 
come from the $20,000 already allo-
cated to the spirit group.

Gupta was determined to keep the 
funding separate.

A bill ensuring continued health-
care coverage for students who take 
leaves of absence for medical rea-
sons went into effect last week, one 
year after President George W. Bush 
signed it into law.

HR 2851 — also known as 
Michelle’s law — allows students to 
take up to one year of leave from col-
lege, while retaining coverage under 
their parents’ health insurance. 

The bill was named after Michelle 
Morse, a former student at Plymouth 
University in New Hampshire. In 

2004, Morse was diagnosed with 
colon cancer and was advised by 
doctors to stay home and 
rest while undergoing 
chemotherapy. Morse’s 
insurer informed her that 
she would no longer be 
eligable for coverage if she 
failed to remain a full-
time student. However, 
when she took a leave of 
absence from school to 
focus on the treatment, 
Morse could no longer be 
covered by her parents’ 
health insurance.

Morse underwent 
chemotherapy while tak-
ing a full load of classes, 
eventually graduating 
with honors. She passed 
away six months later.

“As policies renew, Michelle’s Law 
now takes place,” her mother Anne 

Marie Morse said. “It’s a preemp-
tive law — all states must adopt the 

law as a minimum. 
Some states, such as 
New Mexico and New 
Hampshire, expanded 
that.”

State Senator George 
Runner authored 
California’s version of 
the law, which applies 
to graduate students as 
well as undergraduates. 

“[Sen. Runner] took 
an interest in it to pre-
vent an unfair situation 
regarding insurance 
coverage,” Runner’s 
C o m m u n i c a t i o n s 
Director Jana Saastad 
said. “He wanted to 
help students contin-

ue recieving insurance while going 
through catastrophic medical situ-

ations.
By staying in school, Morse and 

other students in similar situations 
lack the time necessary to focus on 
vital treatment and recovery.

“It’s a Catch-22,” UCSD Insurance 
Coordinator Jessica Morris said. 
“You’re too sick to come to school, but 
you have to be a full-time student to 
stay on your parent’s insurance.”

After Morse’s death, her mother 
began a letter-writing campaign in an 
effort to change the law.

“I called the insurance company, 
spoke to an employee and found out 
the information was correct,” Anne 
Marie Morse said. “The employee 
said to me, ‘Okay, Mrs. Morse, you 
can change the law, and that’ll take 
a long time.’ I said, ‘Okay, I have the 
time.’ And I got started.”

Only nine months into his term, President Barack Obama was handed the 
most prestigious award for peace in 
the world — and he hasn’t done a 
damn thing to deserve it.

Since its inception over 100 years 
ago, the Nobel Peace Prize has been 
the highest form of international 
peace props you can score. Greats 
like Martin Luther King, Jr., Mother 
Teresa and Nelson Mandela are 
among a few of the prize’s past recip-
ients — people who lived for their 
respective causes and took radical 
action for a better future. 

Not to get nitpicky, but Alfred 
Nobel’s will says the peace prize 
should go “to the person who shall 
have done the most or the best work 
for fraternity between the nations 
and the abolition or reduction of 
standing armies and the formation 
and spreading of peace congresses.”

Simply put, the awardee usually 
can’t be, say, leading two wars and 
serving as overseer of Torture Island. 

Apparently, the Norwegian Nobel 
Committee was able to overlook 
such details and focus on the presi-
dent’s efforts to improve relations 
between the U.S. and the Middle 
East and decrease the world’s nuclear 
missile stockpile. 

True, Obama has advocated that 
world leaders agree to collectively 
eliminate over 200 of the 1,700 nukes 
currently in existence. Of course, 
it’s a step in the right direction, but 
might not be the most concrete 
accomplishment. I’m pretty sure 
Jong and Medvedev didn’t trash their 
nukes the moment he said that.

A much more important factor 
of peace is the whole not-fighting-
and-killing thing. In this category, 
Obama sacked a Nobel Peace Prize 
as reasonably as Rush Limbaugh 
might earn a lifetime achievement 
award from the National Association 
for the Advancement of Colored 
People.

First, let’s consider our war in 
Afghanistan. Since Obama took 
office, 21,000 more soldiers have 
been deployed to posts around the 
war-battered country. His top mili-
tary advisors have recommended 
sending an additional 40,000 
troops in the near future, and the 
president has consistently referred to 
Afghanistan as the “just” war, signal-
ing no end to the bloodshed. 

Taliban or not, the war in 
Afghanistan is still a war, and more 
than enough citizens have paid the 
price on both sides. 

Old Nobel would be stirring in 
his grave if he knew that the most 
recent recipient of his esteemed 
award had actually increased the 
standing armies abroad. 

Nobel also probably wouldn’t 
have appreciated a little place called 
Guantanamo Bay. One of Obama’s 
first initiatives as president was to 
close the island prison on the island 
of Cuba that currently houses some 
250 suspected terrorists. During a 
Bush administration that saw the 
bastardization of American values 
under the Patriot Act, Guantanamo

Apparently, the campus shuttle service is out of money. Bus lines will be eliminated. 
Ridership will plummet. Everyone 
will start driving to campus. Parking 
will be a nightmare. Carbon emissions 
will skyrocket. The environment is 
doomed. Everything is ruined.

Time to panic? Kind of. Though 
our shuttles — like every public com-
modity in this near-failed state — may 
soon bow to the budget crisis, the 
department of transportation services 
has a novel idea: Raise student fees.

The department hopes to pass a 
$20 quarterly fee referendum by the 
end of this year — one sponsored by 
our own student government. 

If passed, the new fee would con-
tribute $1.5 million to the bus and 
shuttle services in its first year. From 
there, the fee would increase by $5 
every year for the next four years, 
eventually rising to $40. 

But don’t bust out your picket sign 
of the month just yet: The referendum 
would also give the A.S. Council the 
option to create a board to control the 
shuttle routes — a board comprised 
mostly of students. 

A student-run, 
student-funded shuttle 
service tailored to stu-
dent needs. 

Let’s not get lost in 
the shiny appeal of our 
very own bus line just 
yet, though. When the 

university creates boards like the one 
proposed, it also ensures that students 
could never sway a major decision. 
More than anything, this is a great 
opportunity for the administration to 
tax the student body, save its broken 
assets and package it all under the 
guise of student empowerment. 

Take the Athletic, Recreation and 
Sports Facility Board, for example. 
Created in 2004 to oversee campus 

recreational spending, the board does 
virtually nothing. To this day, student 
organizations are charged an addi-
tional fee to host events at RIMAC. 
The A.S. Council even set up its own 
committee to investigate this ques-
tionable double-charging scheme. 
You can see how well that went.

Even if shuttle control is indeed 
ceded to students, this transfer of 
power could have negative results. The 
A.S. Council has never demonstrated 
itself to be a particularly effective deci-
sionmaking body — why leave them 
in charge of something as important 
as getting to and from campus? 

For students to wield this type of 
responsibility, certain conditions must 
be met. Any alterations to the service 
should be made only after consult-
ing transportation experts — and all 
major decisions should be made only 
after surveying the student body. 

Additionally, those students serv-
ing on the board should have to be 
elected through a campuswide vote. 

Student appointees — like the ones 
currently serving on every major (and 
mostly ineffective) campus committee 
— tend to be apathetic. Prospective 
members should have to work for a 
place on this new board, and their 
selection shouldn’t be marred by 
internal council politics. 

And, as long as we’re making a 
wish list, let’s be sure to eliminate the 
automatic $5-per-year fee increase. 
It’s not fair to levy a tax on future stu-
dents — let them vote on another fee 
increase four years from now.

“It’s your referendum,” Director 
of Parking and Transportation Brian 
d’Autremont said to the Guardian edi-
torial board. “Not ours.”

But it is theirs, and students need 
to keep that in mind. This referendum 
is designed to save a failing campus 
service, one already heavily bankrolled 
by students through parking-permit 
revenue. It’s OK to be outraged.

Ultimately, however, the shuttles 
need to stay. They provide transporta-

tion for thousands of students every 
day, and, when you factor in the envi-
ronmental benefits, paying a $20 fee is 
kind of like doing your civic duty.

Let’s just make sure we take our 
time with this one.

Spring Quarter was host to a rowdy campaign season for 2009-10 A.S. Council hope-
fuls, the majority of whom were 
especially enthusiastic about council 
visibility. Putting preach to practice 
this Monday, elected councilmembers 
— or, about 10 of the 50-odd students 
currently serving on the council — 
held the year’s first official “press 
conference” on their trusty ol’ black 
platform in Price Center Plaza.

A.S. President Utsav Gupta gave 
a short rundown of student-govern-
ment goings-on to an unenthusiastic 
scattering of food-court patrons. He 
was followed by the always-charming 
VP Finance and Resources Peter 
Benesch, who delivered an uplifting 
speech about supporting the Grove 
Cafe, a longtime A.S. enterprise in the 
Student Center that the council plans 
to revamp this year. 

That’s when things got kind of 
awkward.

“We also have two other vice 
presidents who couldn’t make it here 
today,” Gupta said.

He later attributed the absence of 
VP External Affairs Gracelynn West 
and VP Student Life Ricsie Hernandez 
to conflicts in their class schedules, 
though it seemed elemental that the 
press conference be adjusted accord-
ing to the availability of two of four 
top cabinet members. It’s equally 
amusing that conference planners had 
the time to print out nifty little event-
specific “Press Access” laminates to 
adorn their A.S. lanyards, but couldn’t 
drag along all the councilmembers 
needed to answer department-specific 
questions from students.

Not that there was much crowd 

participation, beyond a faceless “I 
want my money back!” and a coun-
cilmember’s threat that Gupta would 
be held accountable for his “bullshit” 
plans for a football referendum. 

Campuswide Senator Adam 
Kenworthy and the two Warren 
College senators did make a noble 
attempt at catching side-glances from 
disinterested students via the shouting 
approach — though a sense of desper-
ation couldn’t help but ring through 
all councilmembers’ voices by the end 
of the one-sided “conference.”

In the end, we agree it’s ridiculous 
that A.S. councilmembers would 
have to bend so far backward to get 
students to care about the almost $150 
they pay to the council’s annual bud-
get. Especially considering that the fee 

almost doubled last year. Ideally, we 
would all get off our asses and trek to 
the fourth floor of Price Center East 
every Wednesday evening to have our 
say. But we have to remember that 
most UCSD students didn’t even vote 
— neither for their representatives nor 
their puffed-up concerts-and-events 
contribution. But it’s still their money, 
and it’s one of the councilmembers’ 
most elemental jobs to force an alien-
ated student body to care. 

First, that means showing up like 
they care themselves. Where are those 
game faces we saw plastered all over 
campus during election season? Gupta 
can’t run a one-man show here. We 
recognize that there have been other 
individual A.S. efforts this year: West 
rallied student support for the walk-

out, and Hernandez has been hard at 
work on the First Fall program.

But no A.S. initiative will ever 
gain the student momentum it needs 
without some illusion of unity at the 
top. Visibility isn’t preferable if you’re 
visibly falling apart. It’s great to see 
Gupta and Benesch are getting along 
so well, but the absence of their other 
half, along with a giant chunk of the 
council’s voting body, paints an initial 
image for students of their council as 
a piecey, disunified clique. And really, 
guys — we’d love to be proven wrong.

The press conference was a start. 
But visibility events must far exceed 
the originally projected one per quar-
ter and target alternative locations like 
the Student Center. Three quarters go 
by a lot faster than you think.

OPINION� THURSDAY, OCTOBER 15, 2009� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 5 

ON THE LINE By Christina Aushana

Bay became its paragon. Shutting 
down the prison would have been 
a fantastic start for Obama’s pro-
jected plan of change. But after 
encountering a strong opposition in 
Congress, where it faced a 90-6 vote, 
Obama shelved his plan to close 
Guantanamo. 

I understand the bureaucratic 
nightmare that would have awaited 
Obama had he tried to overcome a 
90-6 vote, but the fact that he imme-
diately gave up and hasn’t mentioned 
it since makes me 
question how sincere 
he was about ever 
actually closing the 
prison in the first 
place. Perhaps it was 
simply a way to mar-
ket himself.

While previous 
Nobel Prize winners 
were awarded for 
persistence in the face 
of serious adversity, 
Obama was given the 
same award after losing a staring 
contest with House Republicans.

Granted, I do believe that Obama 
has done a great deal to improve the 
U.S.’s global image after eight hor-
rendous years of President George 
W. Bush’s administration. I was lucky 
enough to be in Egypt after he spoke 
there last spring, where locals were 
thrilled to talk to me about our new 
president. 

Obama’s successful public rela-
tions shouldn’t go unnoticed, but they 
hardly warrant a Nobel Peace Prize.

The Norwegian Nobel 
Committee’s commissioner, 
Thorbjoern Jagland, said last week 
that Obama’s actions to date “have 
contributed to — I wouldn’t say a 
safer world — but a world with less 
tension.” If the qualifications for a 

Nobel Peace Prize now include simply 
decreasing tension, we could have 
saved a lot of trouble by just treating 
all the world’s leaders to a day at a shi-
atsu massage parlor. 

For eight years under Bush we 
were frustrated, depressed and bit-
ter. Obama came along and offered 
a large body of people some hope. 
They latched on to Obama’s “change” 
wagon and rediscovered feelings of 
national pride that had disappeared 
long ago. 

There were a few of us out there 
who were critical of 
Obama’s actual pro-
gram from the start, 
but the majority saw 
him as the savior of 
American politics, 
both here and abroad.

The simple truth 
is that Obama isn’t a 
savior. He won’t fix all 
our problems, and of 
course no single per-
son ever can — but 
chances are, he won’t 

even come close.
I hope Obama will do great 

things one day, but for now, he’s 
drifting on a worldwide public-rela-
tions campaign and a never-ending 
bouquet of flowery speeches.

After winning the award, Obama 
said he was “surprised and deeply 
humbled” — and I believe him. 
Even Obama himself doesn’t think 
he deserves the award. Yet here he 
is, one Nobel Peace Prize richer.

Not every prizewinner has suc-
ceeded on the MLK/Mother Teresa 
level, so I’m not saying that Obama 
has that requisite. 

But after nine months of unful-
filled promises, endless warring 
and an open torture center, can we 
really hail the president as any sort 
of peacekeeper?

Dear Editor,
This morning, KUSI-TV ran a 

story on the unveiling of a “Latino” 
mural on campus. 

But what was really unveiled 
was the far, far left agenda of the 
university, by pandering to the anti-
American Hispanics and permitting 
them to display clearly religious and 
political statements. 

Including “health care for all” is 
a divisive statement and is strictly 
political in nature. 

In an environment where self-

reliance and upward mobility should 
be taught, this only serves to further 
the parasitical entitlement mentality 
of low expectations resulting from 
low self-esteem and “victimization.” 

Imagine the outcry if openly 
Christian symbols with “enforce 
border security” or “no amnesty” 
were brazenly depicted by faith-
based American patriots. But no 
such outrage when enemies such as 
anti-American, murdering terrorists 
like “Che” Guevara are exalted. 

UCSD’s clear endorsement of 
anti-white, anti-straight, anti-faith, 
anti-American sentiments in the 
name of “diversity” is just another 
example of the socialist liberals 

undermining our great, traditional 
American culture.

6 THE UCSD GUARDIAN� THURSDAY, OCTOBER 15, 2009� OPINION

On Oct. 10, Turkey and Armenia signed a historic peace treaty to restore diplomacy and re-open their long-sealed border. Given that the two countries have endured nearly a century of 
discontent following the Armenian genocide, many remain skeptical as to whether the treaty is anything more than a superficial display of good will, accompanied by a faux-friendly hand-
shake between the nation’s leaders. But what does the treaty really signify? 

 www.CaliforniaWestern.edu

 What is the law?
        A weapon to be wielded?

 Or more than that?
        A set of tools.

           A creative approach.

    A helping profession and collaborative process.

 Explore the wide scope of the law

              in a school devoted to the big picture.

It’s obvious that the recent peace treaty upon which Turkey and 
Armenia have agreed isn’t the stron-
gest signifier of peace between the 
nations’ citizens. Regardless, overarch-
ing statements from world leaders do 
make a difference over time.

As powerful players in history, 
Turkish President Abdullah Gül and 
Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan 
recognized that — given the 1915 
Armenian genocide at the hands of 
the Turks — one that the nation still 
refuses to acknowledge — bad blood 
still runs pretty deep here. 

While clearly, a single well-pub-
licized treaty can’t instantly reverse 
96 years of ill will, hostility does fade 
with time. 

A sincere and convicted declara-
tion by a national leader can also 
seep into his people’s consciousness 
over an extended period of time. The 
Truman Doctrine of 1947, for instance 
— which stressed the need to spread 
democracy by preventing communism 
from taking root in Turkey and Greece 
— set the tone for decades of inter-
ventionist foreign policy in America. 

In this case a tone of peacefulness 
is still far from being fully established, 
but signing a peace treaty is a posi-
tive first step on the road to recon-
ciliation. For genuine good will to be 
established between two long-hostile 
nations, a pre-emptive gesture may 
need to be the starting point.

Despite their governments’ best intentions, nearly a century 
of animosity between Turkey and 
Armenia cannot be instantly brushed 
aside by two signatures on a treaty.

When the two countries’ lead-
ers met last Saturday, they both 
chose to ignore the giant elephant in 
the room: Turkey still vehemently 
refuses to acknowledge the Armenian 
Genocide of 1915 to 1923. When the 
U.S. Senate proposed to recognize the 
genocide in 1989, Turkey responded 
by blocking American ships in the 
Mediterranean and suspending U.S. 
military training facilities in Turkish 
territory.

Tensions between the two coun-
tries have continued for years in 
the region of Nagorno-Karabakh, a 
conflict area between Armenia and 
its Turkish ally Azerbaijan, which 
has kept Turkey and Armenia at 
each others’ throats. Even though an 
official ceasefire has been in place for 
years, fighting in the region unsur-
prisingly continues to this day. 

In the end, no official document 
or room of cordial officals can hope 
to eliminate longstanding disagree-
ments at ground level.

Ironically, both parties delayed 
the treaty’s signing in an attempt to 
censor the other’s statements. The 
Oct. 10 ceremony was delayed three 
hours as both leaders pouted in their 
respective corners of rhetoric — until 
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham 

Clinton cajoled the two to make nice 
and sign the document. Meaning, in 
case we didn’t know, it was nothing 
more than a public relations stunt at 
the end of the day.

 Former Armenian Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Vardan Oskanyan 
said it himself: “Signing these docu-
ments will not solve our problems. 
On the contrary, they will bring on 
entirely new setbacks and problems 
that can only be tackled by a unified, 
free, hopeful society.”

Without the backing of their 
respective populations, this treaty will 
only increase internal and external 
tension. Armenians fear the condi-
tions of the protocols will be entirely 
on Turkey’s terms. Reuters reports 
that, immediately following the cer-
emony, Turkey called on Armenia to 
withdraw from Nagorno-Karabakh 
— a move that Armenian leaders are 
still contemplating.

Tensions between Armenia and 
Turkey have clearly not dissipated 
with the wave of a magic pen — both 
nations have a deep-seated history 
of conflict, and their friction will 
not disappear with empty words of 
acceptance. It’s about time world 
leaders dropped their flashy press-
conference acts and start talking the 
issue out from the bottom up.

Contributing Writer

Turkey and Armenia’s super-ficial peace pact, in the end, 
amounts to little more than a stra-
tegic Turkish move for admission 
into the European Union. 

Turkey has been clamoring to 
join the EU since 1987, though 
its patchy human rights record — 
including heavy censorship, sketchy 
relations with Cyprus and poor 
treatment of Armenia — have sig-
nificantly delayed its acceptance.

Although the treaty is a nomi-
nal declaration that does not guar-
antee progress between Armenia 
and Turkey, signing it could easily 
bring the latter that much closer 
to overcoming EU objections. No 
matter how much support may 
be lacking within the Armenian 
and Turkish populations, on an 
international level, this is a defini-
tive step toward Turkey’s ability to 

redress its image as an aggressor, 
and may indeed bring it one step 
closer to that golden EU member-
ship it so desperately craves.

Armenia’s potential gains aren’t 
so concrete. A treaty may have its 
economic benefits in time, but for 
the most part, it’s Turkey — who 
has been arguing its status as a 
developed country and EU asset 
for over 20 years — that stands to 
gain more from the pact. If this 
accord proves fruitful and leads to 
Turkish-Armenian alliance (which 
will almost certainly first require a 
recognition of the Armenian geno-
cide), the subsequent stabilization 
of the region will only strengthen 
Turkey’s long-denied bid for 
admission.

Hear from the artists of Tijuana/San 
Diego: Cooperation and Confrontation 
at the Interface at a 4 p.m. panel in 
the Calit2 Theater, followed by an 
opening reception airing sound works 
from grad students.

I t’s that time of year again, folks: The massive San Diego Asian Film Festival is back in full force, with an impres-sive lineup of 102 narrative features, documentaries, 
short films and animation showcased at the UltraStar 
Mission Valley Theater in Hazard Center. The event, 
which runs from Oct. 15 to Oct. 29, offers an opportunity 
to engage in discussion with filmmakers and actors, par-
ticipate in educational panels and workshops and watch 
the star-studded awards gala all at a student-friendly price.  
As follows, the best of the East:

“WHITE ON RICE”
FRIDAY, OCT. 16 7 P.M. TUESDAY, OCT. 20 8:55 P.M.

A t 40, the newly divorced Jimmy (“Letters from Iwo Jima”) is moving from Japan to America to restart his life with the help of his sister, Aiko; her displeased 
husband, Tak; and their 10-year-old, 

Bob, who, as his name suggests, is 
wise far beyond his years. While 

Jimmy’s “rebirth” requires him 
to share a bunk bed with 
Bob, he is strangely optimis-
tic about his mission to find 
the perfect replacement for 
his ex-wife. Socially clueless 
as he is — about as suave 
as a Steve Carell typecast — 

Jimmy botches his chances 
with a number of women 

before meeting his unfortunate 
match: Tak’s niece Ramona (“Saving 

Face”). Of course, hilarity ensues.

“CHILDREN OF INVENTION”
THURSDAY, OCT. 15 7 P.M. (FREE RECEPTION AT 5:30)

I n this American dream-shattering exploration of the immigrant experience by freshman director Tze Chun, single mother Cindy (Elaine Cheung) 
struggles to support her two children 
(Michael Chen, Crystal Chiu) 
when the trio is evicted and 
seeks refuge in an unfur-
nished apartment. After 
moving in and out of sales 
jobs, Cindy’s desperation 
leads her into a Ponzi 
scheme designed to vic-
timize unknowing immi-
grants. When the scheme 
collapses, she is separated 
from her children, who 
must survive on their own. 
Confronting hot topics like 
economic meltdown and the 
exploitation of immigrants, this 
one’s a groundbreaker all around.

“RED CLIFF”
SUNDAY, OCT. 18 7 P.M. TUESDAY, OCT. 20 8:55 P.M.

A ction director John Woo defined ’80s Hong Kong cine-ma with classics like “The Killer, “Hard Boiled” and “A Better Tomorrow.” In the ’90s, he created Hollywood 
blockbusters “Face/Off” and “Mission Impossible II.” Today, 
Woo returns to his roots with the most expensive film in 
the history of Asian cinema: an epic account of the Battle 
of Red Cliff, where a force of 50,000 men defeated an army 
of nearly one million in the final days of the Han Dynasty. 
With an all-star cast including Tony Leung (“Infernal 
Affairs”), Takeshi Kaneshiro, Wei Zhao (“So Close”) and 
Fengyi Zhang, “Red Cliff ” is old-fashioned mythic fun from 
one of Asian cinema’s living legends. 

SAN DIEGO ASIAN FILM FESTIVAL
Retain Fuzzies, 
Stay Cool —
and the Lips
Can Help! 

S o I used to be relatively cool. No, for real though. For instance, I used to like like the Stooges. I also 
liked putting weird shit in my hair. I 
knew someone who knew Tom Waits. 
I elbowed a hot path to the front row, 
put my hands in the air when the 

emcee told me so, stuffed my pockets 
with expensive cheeses and didn’t even 
think to gargle when my throat hurt. 

What’s more, I nourished the 
croak — running to meet whichever 
icy ocean break was nearest, double-
doggy daring my own naked saltwa-
ter death to overtake me then, there, 
in one gallant fit of afterparty.

OK, so I was also retarded. But in 
the coolest way possible — promise.

Alas, that was then. At some indis-
tinguishable point between small-town 
high school and the grand poetic flop 
that is the UCSD writing circle, I self-
mutilated into a ruffled, domestic little 
nester with an eye for snuggly stuffed 
monkeys, shiny-pretty things and cer-
tainly no more patience for Unfinished 
Music. (Come to think of it, life was 
probably all downhill from that cer-
emonious five-paragraph butcher of 
Kafka’s “Penal Colony” freshman year. 
Since then, one too many nature hai-
kus and long-distance relationships, I 
suppose.)

Fast fact: The older, uncooler me 
chooses to store over 3,000 puppy 
photos on her hard drive. And get 
this. Every time it maxes out, some 
cuddly force within goes and deletes 
the longest Godspeed or Sigur Ros 
song it can find — gone forever in an 
Apple trash crinkle, all in the name 
of chasingowntail001.jpg. As summer 
turns to fall turns to winter, however, 
the most disconcerting of gray hairs 
begins to wriggle from the confines of 
this collegiate bun, sullying the good 
name of Great-Great Grandmother 
Electra, leaping for Baby Jesus joy at 
the mere opening bells of — feel free 
to slap me now — motherfucking

ARTREVIEW S tep into the normally orderly Atkinson Hall in Earl Warren 
College and your ears are 
met with muffled sonic 
chaos, emanating from 
Calit2’s Gallery Interior. 

Computer music 
graduate student José 
Ignacio López Ramírez-
Gastón is the guilty 
party, with his peace-
disturbing installation 
“24 Speakers and 24 
Sound Sources.” Standing 
outside the double doors, 
the artist smiled. 

“They usually keep 
these doors open,” López 
said. “But because of the 
sound, they had to close 
them.” 

And that’s precisely 
the point of “24 Speakers.” 
Through interactive audio 
and visuals, López’ art 
draws attention to the 
stark cultural contrast 
between geographically 
adjacent cities Tijuana 
and San Diego. The artist 
strives to force a little dis-
order from south of the 
border onto UCSD’s ultra 
clean campus.

“Tijuana and San 
Diego depend on each 
other, and the contrast 

S eemingly inspired by Brooklyn artist Tara Donovan’s sub-lime “Untitled” sculpture — a piece crafted from hundreds of Styrofoam cups and glue — the exterior of “Media Womb” is 
deceivingly simple. Sitting smack dab in the middle of Atkinson Hall’s 
main walkway, the layered structure is made from more or less unso-
phisticated materials: Hundreds of cardboard egg cartons are stacked 
to form a rectangular womb large enough for four people to sit in

Clear plastic tubes equipped with motion sensors dangle from 
the womb’s ceiling, forming wind-chimey patterns. The slightest 
movement inside the structure is picked up by the sensors and met

TIMOTHY WONG/GUARDIAN

Though what is generally referred to as the “Chicano history mural” — commissioned to be painted by Mario Torero — has been hanging in Thurgood Marshall College for some 
weeks now, a crowd of students, faculty and staff gathered out back Peterson Hall on Wednesday afternoon to watch a series of speakers — including Marye Anne Fox and a 
female student who had just jotted down a poem in the library — dedicate the artwork, and all its connotations, to each other and their “community.” The piece is actually an 
enlarged digital snapshot of a smaller painting, of about eight feet wide. A tad fragmented and unideally not painted by students, sure, but it’s about time we colored up this 
campus a little bit. Petitions are currently floating around to protest the projected removal of the mural on Dec. 12 — you’d be best off checking the Cross-Cultural center.

HIATUS PICKS THE WEEK’S BEST BETS

Easily compared to the Voltron-esque Traveling Willburys 
— which included George Harrison, Bob Dylan and Tom 
Petty — this generation’s jangly supergroup pulls all sorts 
of all-stars from the indie-folk pool. We get two parts Bright 
Eyes (Conor Oberst and Mike Mogis), one part My Morning 
Jacket (Jim James) and one part fellow Thousand Oaks High 
School graduate M. Ward. Adding up to a jammy mish-mash 
of driving anthems, acoustic asides and country-fried 
harmonies that should translate epically onstage to a playful 
diversion from the members’ main work. They might not be 
Ringo’s All Starr Band, but they’re worth a pricey ticket. (CK)

Technicolor Navajo Passes His Peace
Pipe, Packed With Teen Nostalgia

A fter 34 studio albums, count-less live recordings and a nev-er-ending tour, the legendary 
Bob Dylan treks into extremely 
charted territory with the unpre-
dictable career move Christmas In 
the Heart — 15 gravelly renditions 
of traditional carols.

Has Mr. Tambourine Man 
regressed into Santa’s Little Helper? 
Yes, in a way, as all royalties go 
straight to Feeding America, a 
hunger-relief charity. Dylan also 
partnered with Citibank to make 
the album available a week earlier 
to those enrolled in the bank’s 
reward program. 

This from the same Dylan 
who, over 40 years ago, sat alone 
on stage, guitar in hand, weaving 
incendery melodies of protest 
and contempt? The former voice 
of a generation has once again 
demonstrated his willingness to 
sell out, this time by singing “Have 
Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.” 
Oh, the shame.

The times may be a-changin’, 
but at least this gimmicky set 
showcases Dylan’s classic old 
croak, even if the raspy and hard-
ened 68-year-old pipes at times 

seems to channel a drunken pedo-
phile.

Dylan covers all the traditional 
holiday hymns — from “Little 
Drummer Boy,” to “First Noel,” 
to any other tune that happens to 
include a manger or wise man. 
On “Must Be Santa,” a freakishly 
upbeat accordian proves Santa 
officially zonked on uppers, while 
Dylan’s voice fails to wheeze out 
the remainder of the tune. The 
unbearable cheese of the album’s 
backup choir harkens a pre-rock, 
pre-Dylan time period, rendering 
this mantelpiece nothing more 
than an old-timey novelty with 
none of Bob’s historic bite.

Dylan now proudly joins 
the long list of artists — N’Sync, 
Christina Aguilera and the Beach 
Boys included — who have 
churned out their own versions of 
every beaten-to-death jolly jam on 
the pageant setlist. Screw being in 
the Rock ‘n’ Roll Hall of Fame or 
one of the century’s most influen-
tial people — Dylan is warming 
hearts this holiday season.

Bobby D. Carols for Charity Like 
New Jersey’s Homeless Best

I f an ’80s pop song was fur-ther simplified into the blippy soundtrack to your favorite 
childhood Nintendo game, that 
twisted candyland would sound a 
lot like Neon Indian.

Their new LP, Psychic Chasms, 
is a shimmery fuse of pulsing elec-
tro-beats and breathy melodies, 
spliced with choppy laser-gun 
sound effects and thrown together 
in a drug-dusted haze after a 
string of failed relationships.   

The latest project from Alan 
Palomo (also of VEGA), Indian is 
a collaboration with video artist 
Alicia Scardetta, who contrib-
utes multimedia complements to 
Palomo’s jams. Initially hyped as a 
mysterious duo, the pair’s first three 
singles created a frenzy on the 
blogosphere — and like so, Indian’s 
legendary status was birthed. When 
Palomo finally revealed his secret 
identity, both VEGA and Indian 
had made headlines and garnered 
their fair share of Internet props. 

The album’s dazed, summery 
sound is easy on the ears, some-
thing akin to a sun-warped MGMT 
album playing on your parents’ 
ancient RPM-mangling record 

player. Pop in your headphones, 
and you risk daydreaming you’re a 
Yogi dropping acid while screwing 
around on the turntables.

Squiggly pads and reverberat-
ing chants swamp a song like 
“Terminally Chill” to a hyper-retro 
degree, and while cheesy keys and 
stock Casio beats are all the rage 
right now, Palomo ultimately gets 
away with it — so well-crafted is 
his songwriting.

Indian’s lyrics are laced with 
hard-to-swallow regret, capturing 
the tailspins our minds can whirl 
into over missed chances, though 
they sometimes deteriorate into a 
series of sighs and unintelligible 
murmurs. “Should Have Taken 
Acid With You” sums up the 
wistful teenage vibe that Palomo 
attempts to conjur, and with lines 
like “Touch the stars and the plan-
ets too” and “Take our clothes off 
in the swimming pool,” we yearn 
for the carefree. Be sure to throw 
Chasms on at your Monday night 
kickback or the neighbor’s next 
backyard skinny dip.

���THE UCSD GUARDIAN� THURSDAY, OCTOBER 15, 2009� HIATUS

with an immediate aural 
response. One side of the 
womb produces environmen-
tal static recorded in Tijuana, 
while the other end answers 
simple motion with harsh 
gunshots lifted straight from 
popular media reports of vio-
lence at the border. 

After a few minutes of 
experimentation, you begin to 
learn a sense of the womb’s sonic patterns, and how to manipulate your move-
ments in order to change volume, pitch and speed. 

“Media Womb,” a collaboration between Giacoma Castagnola, Camilo 
Ontiveros, Nina Waisman and Felipe Zuniga — three of whom studied visual art 
at UCSD — imposes on us a sense of hope. Upon understanding the space, its 
noise is no longer dictated by the programmed womb, which represents popular 
media. Rather, the decision-making power is shifted onto ourselves as individu-
als: We can now control this environment in sonic expression.

between them enriches our lives in 
so many ways,” López said. “There is 
much we can learn from accepting the 
power of our multicultural environ-
ment.”

Open the doors holding the 
Tijuana native’s work, and the full 
acoustic effect hits a gust of sonic 
wind. Streaming through an eclectic 
collection of audio sources — includ-
ing tape recorders and used speakers 
as large as small children — are two 
TJ radio stations and a CD containing 
horn-heavy Latin music straight from 
a Tijuana street market.

Spanning three walls, the speak-
ers and other noisemakers are evenly 
spaced in a semicircle, crudely con-
nected with wires and cables that 
pile in a jumbled mess upon a small 

table — eventually leading to a stereo 
receiver with its circuit board exposed. 
Two old-school television sets play a 
staticky live feed of Tijuana TV.

The setup is so low-tech, López 
said, that the audience is invited to 
mess with faders and see what hap-
pens — ensuring no two people will 
ever experience the piece in the same 
way. By choosing  not to use hi-tech 
commodities like computer program-
ming, López questions the convention-
al approach to sonic installations.

“Is sound experimentation depen-
dent on access to expensive technol-
ogy?” he asked. “I am trying to rep-
resent a sound space that is based in 
the cultural strategies of informal and 
marginalized communities — com-
munities that in this case are right 
next door.”

Diverse Installations Take on 
Issues Plaguing the Border
▶ SPEAKERS, MYVT�WHNL��

▶ WOMB, MYVT�WHNL��

H ere at the frontier, Mexico offers itself for sale to the world. Come one and all, and invest in our cheap labor!” This sarcastic yet heavy exclamation provides the opening text for the 
15th piece in visual-arts professor Fred Lonidier’s 35-year documentary photo/
text installation, which details the corrupt labor movement at the border.

Spanning over 10 feet, east to west, on Calit2’s display wall, “Rio Tijuana 
Bridge: A Tale of Two Globes or Two Tales of a Globe” consists of two laminated 
sheets of paper covered in excerpts from articles and photographs, bordered by 
colorful flags from across the world.

Through the installation, Lonidier presents a lesson on globalization that reads 
like a chapter from a textbook the government would love to censor: Instead of 
a champion for democracy, the U.S. is portrayed as a destructive force, ruthlessly 
wiping out all traces of cultural identity. 

“My work is pedagogical in intent to inform those who do not know about a 
particular struggle or class struggle in general,” Lonidier said. “For workers and 
union members, I hope to aid militancy and solidarity.”

E lectrical and computer engineer-ing professor Lea Rudee’s “Tijuana River” is a glimpse at the tremen-
dous diversity in scenery along a river 
that runs just 120 miles long. A series 
of 12 photographs taken by the artist 
in the ’90s, “River” initially appears a 
simple, aesthetically pleasing collection 
of landscapes. Upon closer examination, 
the shots begin to tell the story of the 
messy physical struggle between the San 
Diego and Tijuana communities — an 
issue that goes largely unnoticed by 
those on the cushy side of the border.

 The tale begins at the river’s end, in 
San Diego. Between chocolate-brown 
hills, Rudee captures the river at its fin-
est: Stoic, bare trees stand amid calm, 
blue waters beneath open skies. Then, 
juxtaposed with this first image, cracked 
asphalt on the banks of murky waters represents the aftermath of the devastating 
1993 flood which consumed everything in its path.

Rudee unleashes the most human element of his installation in a black-and-
white print depicting four undocumented migrant workers attempting to cross 
the colossal sewage channels surrounding the river, in order to break through 
the U.S. border. Four photographs later, an image of a homemade welcome sign 
equating undocumented aliens with garbage and sewage — made by residents 
of San Ysidro — reveals the harsh social backlash of entering America illegally.

HIATUS� THURSDAY, OCTOBER 15, 2009� THE UCSD GUARDIAN���

By Leila Haghighat
Staff Writer

L ike fellow documentarian Morgan Spurlock, Josh Tickell holds a public grudge against 
McDonald’s. The only difference: In 
“Fuel,” grease is good. Deep within 
oil-soaked fries, Tickell claims to 
have found the untapped secret 
to greener fuel: biodiesel. But in a 
112-minute time slot that feels as 
tedious as the 11 years it took to 
make, Tickell painstakingly dissects 
the history of America’s addiction to 
foreign oil, relying on little more than 
celebrity name-drops and one-sided 
arguments as evidence.

The 2008 Sundance Audience 
Award for Best Documentary provides 
a realistic solution to severing depen-
dence on foreign oil: the introduction 
of alternative fuel sources such as sus-
tainable biofuels, biomass and plug-in 
hybrids. Sprinkled with interviews 
with Willie Nelson, Woody Harrelson, 
Sheryl Crow and Julia Roberts, the 
film appeals to the unconverted, 
stick-shifting masses. But — trailing 
closely behind grassroots-advocating 
documentaries like “The 11th Hour” 
— “Fuel” is nothing new.

From the pulpit of his sunflower-
painted Winnebago, Tickell con-
demns the sinfulness of America’s 
oil industry, detailing the ways in 
which it has poisoned the environ-
ment and corrupted the government 
since Rockefeller first subverted the 

ethanol-fueled automobiles of Henry 
Ford by advancing prohibition. 

That dubiousness, Tickell argues, 
persisted in the hush-hush machina-
tions of the Bush and Reagan admin-
istrations, renders “Fuel” as politically 
charged as a Michael Moore expose. 
Pointing the finger at Bush for using 
9/11 as impetus for foreign oil expen-
ditures — and later exploiting the 
same imagery to tug at the audience’s 
heartstrings — Tickwell encourages 
viewers to embrace Flower Power at 
the expense of remaining unbiased.

Although his arguments are well-
grounded, mandated pity eclipses 
the resentment that “Fuel” otherwise 
foments toward Uncle Sam. Rather 
than scold Bush and Cheney for their 
oil-rigging exploits, Tickell focuses 
on painting Presidents Kennedy and 
Carter as saints for their fuel policies. 

Despite the documentary’s histri-
onic moral, Tickell’s passion seems 
genuine, drawing on the pathos of his 
childhood in Louisiana — a “Jurassic 
Park of oil and gas — to illustrate his 
point. As a young boy, he resented 

the state’s oil refineries for thwarting 
his ability to river raft through the 
blue bayous like Huck Finn.

While his vision for biodiesel and 
his filming techniques are equally 
savvy — he uses animated modules 
to break down the oil-refining pro-
cess for us visual learners — periodic 
lecture-style narration dashes any 
chance for “Fuel” to surpass cynical 
expectations of being just another 
didactic documentary. 

The most notable proposal is 
algae biodiesel, which — in addition 
to providing net increase in renew-
able energy — also metabolizes 
carbon dioxide. But regardless of the 
solutions “Fuel” presents, its lack of 
timeliness due to a delayed theatrical 
release in 2008 is difficult to ignore. 
Come on, the Obama campaign was 
last year’s news. Now what? 

“Fuel” may inspire you to use the 
compost bins at OVT, but its earnest 
efforts to be the little movie that 
could makes it unworthy of a trip to 
the theaters — just think of all the 
fuel you’d be wasting.

STARRING JOSHUA TICKELL, WILLIE NELSON & SHERYL CROW   
DIRECTED BY JOSHUA TICKELL

Christmas music.
Any Christmas song will do, really. 

From a Jackson Five-for-UNICEF 
tearjerker to more obscure (read: ter-
rible) cut from Ringo Starr or, erm, 
Mariah Carey, nothing on Earth can 
set my kettle a-whistle like a jolly old 
holiday favorite. (I do understand 
that publicly airing this fact officially 
nulls anything snarky I want to say 
about music, ever again. But when 
Roy Orbison sends me “Pretty Paper” 
— shit; I could live forever pasty and 
happy in the glow of that 
comfort zone.) 

This year, at a criti-
cal stage in the La Jolla 
chill, there was one single 
solitary thing in the galaxy 
that could have prevented 
me from making my 
Ultimate X-mas Mix two 
months early.

Good news, particular-
ly for all you fools cozied 
up to my blown-out back-
seat speakers this holiday 
season: My most true-to-art prayers 
have been answered. Just when it 
looked as if my bellybutton lint would 
never see static again, just when I was 
starting to accept early onset boring-
hood as incurable — the Flaming 
Lips leaked two albums of decidedly 
indigestible Grinchy fluids all over the 
Internet last week, blowing spider-bite 
get-well kisses and mushy life-is-
beautiful lullabies to the wind. 

If there’s one man who makes 
it unacceptable for any of us to feel 
old — but who’s been feeling a little 
too loverly for his own good lately 
— it’s Wayne Coyne. (I saw him in 
an airport once, Yoshimi era. His suit 
was so sharp my ear buds fell out.)  
Despite his 50 years, Coyne walks 
across crowds of happy people in an 
oversized beach ball for a living, nary a 

graying ringlet letting up its bounce on 
the comedown. But there’s been some-
thing gross and hyperactive missing, 
as of late — I’m sure of it now. I start 
to feel no youthful bliss can be true 
and holy without an awkward squeak 
like “Rainin’ Babies” on the way out.

Look — I’m obviously just as fairy 
as the best of the Flamantics. More 
than anyone I have ever wanted to be, 
I have wanted to be Yoshimi. The only 
thing that has ever filled me with as 
much sheer wonder as a Christmas 
song is the crystallized climax of “Do 

You Realize??”
At War With 

the Mystics was a 
little weirder — some 
much-needed sex hair 
— but way too half-
baked Beck to resusci-
tate me from a critical 
state of soft-boned 
twentysomething.

Though it may not 
turn these cheeks quite 
so holly-berry as a 
Beach Boys rendition 

of “Merry Christmas, Baby” — and 
really, what could? — the Lips’ new “I 
Can Be a Frog” is shaping up to be my 
new warm ‘n’ fuzzy place this season 
— my homecoming to the primordial 
mud puddle of cool, if you will. (And 
who would have known pop-art dar-
ling Karen O would help set me back 
on the path to righteousness with her 
finest Gila monster impression?)

Even more thrilling is that a hand-
ful of deceptively sweet “Frogs” are 
Embryonic’s mere portals to the dark 
side, making way for free jazz and 
stupid, fuzzy Doors impressions and 
ugly-ass rebellion without a cause. 
Heck, if Coyne can do it, so can I. 
What ever is this feeling? Time to 
get some feedback into my life again. 
Though the Stooges might just have 
to wait ’til spring.

12�THE UCSD GUARDIAN� THURSDAY, OCTOBER 15, 2009� HIATUS

“SCANDAL MAKERS”
SATURDAY, OCT. 24 7 P.M.
MONDAY, OCT. 26 7:30 P.M.

S elf-obsessed radio personality Hyun-Su (“My Sassy Girl”) counsels people on a popular call-in show. 
But when a young woman shows up on 
his doorstep claiming to be his illegitimate 
long-lost daughter, he is forced to confront his 
own problems, head on. To make matters worse, 
she has a six-year-old son of her own, making Hyun-
Su a grandfather at 36. While the scandal turns the protagonist’s life upside 
down, freshman Korean director Hyeong-Cheol Kang presents the topic with 

clutch comedic timing and an adorable child actor to boot. 
Successful on both commercial and critical levels, the 

comedy is already slated for a Hollywood remake — 
better see what all the fuss is about.

“SCANDAL MAKERS”
THURSDAY, OCT. 15 9:40 P.M. 

Got a soft spot for bloodsuckers, but can’t stomach the mushy teenage “Twilight” 
series? Check director Park Chan Wook’s latest 

vampire thriller. When a blood transfusion goes 
awry during medical experiments, a selfless priest 

(“The Host”) is transformed into Korea’s own Edward 
Cullen — substituting sparkly skin for a pair of insatiable 

fangs. Much like his prepubescent counterpart, Wook’s anti-
hero lusts after a young woman who will test his animal instincts from every 
angle. But don’t expect butterfly kisses or unrequited love — after this blood-
spewing teeth-marker, you may want to rethink your vampire love fantasy.

▶ FESTIVAL, MYVT�WHNL��
FESTIVALPREVIEW

By Matthew Pecot
Staff Writer

D irector F. Gary Gray (“The Italian Job”) threw a little some-
thing for everyone into 
“Law Abiding Citizen.” 

Action fans will salivate 
before the explosive-rich 
revenge plot of Clyde 
Shelton (Gerard Butler, sans 
“300” abs), a family man 
who loses everything in a 
fatal home invasion.

Deep thinkers will 
appreciate the dichotomy of 
morality-based justice and legal-
ism, embodied by Shelton and 
Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) — a hotshot prosecutor who bends 
the truth to get ahead at work.

And homebodies will be warmed by Rice’s attempts 
at balancing work and family. That is, until Shelton sends 
Rice’s daughter a tape of a murderer being tortured.

Don’t expect a breath of fresh air: It takes only 10 min-
utes for Shelton’s life to be flipped upside down, and for 
Rice to cut a deal in exchange for guilty pleas. Before you’ve 
finished your first fistful of popcorn and even started 
thinking about that $5 soda, Shelton’s already halfway 
through his killing spree, and — in the “twist” that the 
trailer hypes — has handed himself over to the police.

Whenever Shelton appears on-screen, the theater crack-
les with vicious, expectant energy that grips the audience 
with the anticipation of a disappearing pencil trick. 

The writers don’t disap-
point, either: Shelton has all 
the calculated cruelty of a 
smartass Moriarty, wielding 
legal precedents with as much 
skill as his MacGyver-inspired 
death toys.

Rice is a little more disap-
pointing — though to be fair, 
Batman never quite equaled 
the Joker, either.

A believer in the system — 
partly because it’s worked so 
well for him — Mr. Assistant 
D.A. of Philly makes for a hell 
of a good guy in over his head 

— too good, in fact. To the point 
where his lapse into corruption feels 
tacked on.

The actors bring the film to life with a little help from 
Philadelphia itself. Gray milks the onetime capital for all 
it’s worth, creating a vivid neo-noire landscape nothing 
like Hollywood’s go-to thriller backdrop. The contrast of 
turn-of-the-century City Hall and Philly’s modern cement-
scape makes for a poignant parallel of civilized rigmarole to 
Shelton’s primitive idea of justice without due process.

Nuanced as his social commentary might be, Gray 
crafts a taut, no-punches-pulled heart-racer that moves 
so fast, you’re neck’s already broken. And if it weren’t for 
the muscles in your face seizing up from that foolish grin, 
you’d be hard pressed to believe that “Citizen” is almost two 
hours long. This isn’t just “Michael Baysplosion 2,” either: 
This is the marriage of great plot, believable actors and a 
script too smart for its own good.

AL MVP Vladimir Guerrero, you know your 
offense has improved. Furthermore, with 
the addition of Scott Kazmir, improvements 
of Jered Weaver, continued development of 
Joe Saunders and always steady (and for the 
ladies, always sexy) John Lackey, the Angels 
maintain a pitching staff that 
allows them to succeed even when 
power numbers might be lacking. 

Bobby Abreu has been hailed as 
this season’s MVP for the Angels 
— and rightfully so. His presence 
and leadership has helped improve 
the team’s patience in players like 
Howie Kendrick, Kendry Morale 
and even the always free-swinging 
Guerrero.

The Yankees, of course, are the 
epitome of the American League 
power attitude. They are also the 
reason why some people hate the 
American League. 

Furthermore, they are the 
reason why a lot of people hate 
America. Actually, they’re the 
epitome of everything that is or will ever be 
wrong with the world. Why do so many peo-
ple hate the Yankees? Well, it’s the same reason 
that so many people without any discernable 
connection to New York love the Yankees: 
Douchebags exist. 

You see them every day. That guy in the 
tank top flashing his gigantic arms and the 
sock in his pants accentuating his small penis. 
That girl who wears makeup to the gym to 
compensate for her STDs. That guy on TV 

who makes more money than several small 
countries combined, broke up his marriage for 
Madonna, brings Kate Hudson to games and 
is now a mutated douchebaggy version of the 
natural athlete he was in Seattle, so that it’s 
hard to remember he’s the same person at all. 

Power on both sides of the ball pushed the 
Yankees to a league-leading 103 
wins during the regular season. 
The strength — be it natural or 
artificial — of Alex Rodriguez, 
Teixiera and cohorts, is matched 
by the hard throwing style of CC 
Sabathia, A.J. Burnett and B.S. 
Pettite (I felt like Andy needed 
some initials). Add a little bit of 
beefy Joba Chamberlain to the 
pot, and you’ve got yourself a stew 
of narcissism, overconfidence and 
victory.

The Angels and Yankees fac-
ing off in the American League 
Championship Series is a true 
battle of National League vs. 
American League philosophy — a 
battle between playing it the right 

way and playing it to get paid. In my mind, a 
battle between good and evil. 

The Angels will supposedly own the 
Yankees in the postseason, like the Red Sox 
previously owned the Angels. Of course, it’d 
be nice to predict a shiny, perfect world where 
Angels fly high and good prevails, but we live 
in a world of douchebaggery — a world where 
the Evil Empire has home-field advantage.

So, Joe (regrettably) goes with: Yankees in 
6 games.

Kemp as the go-to hitters for the LA offense, 
the Dodgers have relied on Manny less and less 
this season. Convenient, considering Manny the 
Tranny never fully returned after his 50-game 
suspension. 

Equally as important to LA's chances of 
victory is whether its starting 
rotation can overcome its inherent 
mediocraty to keep the team close 
enough for Eithier to deliver some 
late-game magic.

Considering that the 2009 
Dodgers have developed a knack 
for come-from-behind wins, it's 
a shame that LA fans at Chavez 
Ravine haven't seen any of them. 
It's kind of hard to see a walk-off 
win in the ninth inning when you 
leave before the seventh-inning 
stretch — a move for which LA fans 
are quite famous. 

And how pumped can a team 
get when its players are cheered 
by a half-empty stadium in pre-
game introductions because its 
fans can't even show up until the 
third inning? A championship-worthy team is 
composed of many pieces, and a faithful (read: 
punctual) fan base is crucial.

For the Phillies to repeat as champions — 
which would be only the fourth time in history 
that a NL team has done so — their offense 
will have to maintain its beast mode, scoring 
at least enough runs to make sure that closer 
Brad Lidge isn’t allowed anywhere near a save 
situation. 

The Phil’s lineup is flat-out scary, and more 
than enough to send Dodgers skipper Joe Torre 
running for a new pair of Depends. With Cliff 
Lee anchoring a pitching staff that includes two 
Cy Young winners and last year’s World Series 
MVP, the City of Brotherly Love seems primed 
for a second-straight parade through the streets 

of South Philly.
While I have no real affinity 

for either of these teams — and 
actual hatred for one of them — I 
am proud to have either one as the 
National League's representative 
in the World Series. Both teams 
play a hustle style of baseball and 
are anchored by a core of young 
players brought up through their 
respective farm systems. Any team 
would kill to have Chase Utley or 
James Looney in a clutch situation. 
Young lefties Clayton Kershaw and 
Cole Hamels have already won 
on the big stage, and are a GM's 
ultimate wet dream. These two 
teams are what NL baseball is all 
about.

Will the Dodgers be able to 
extract revenge on the Phillies after getting 
handed their own asses in five games last 
season? Or will Cole Hamels return to his 2008 
form to complement Lee for the league’s best 
one-two punch? Which of these two National 
League teams will prevail?

Considering I own a T-shirt that reads, 
“Duck the Fodgers,” it gives me great pleasure 
to say: 
Blanc goes with: Phillies in 7 games.

It’d be nice to 
predict a shiny, 
perfect world 
where Angels 
ﬂy high, but we 
live in a world 
of douche-
baggery — a 
world where 
the Evil Empire 
has home-ﬁeld 
advantage.

Lefties Clayton 
Kershaw and 
Cole Hamels 
have already 
won on the big 
stage, and are 
a GM’s ultimate 
wet dream. 
These teams 
are what NL 
baseball is all 
about.

period, the Anteaters extended their advantage when they 
scored two fourth-quarter goals to secure an 8-5 lead. 
Senior two-meter defender Peter Gresham and Roberts 
gave the Tritons a chance when Gresham scored at the 1:26 
mark to cut the margin by two. With 47 seconds remain-
ing, Roberts converted on a man-up opportunity to pull 
the Tritons within one — but the late-game surge was not 
enough to overtake the Anteaters, and UCI held on for the 
8-7 win. 

The Tritons opened the tournament on Oct. 10 facing 
their toughest rivals: the LMU Lions. In a 10-6 defeat, the 
Tritons trailed 5-2 at the end of the first half, and were 
never quite able to claw their way back into the game. 

“Against LMU, we are still figuring out some tactical 
ways to address the team,” Roberts said. “The important 
thing is that every time we play them, we learn new things 
about their strategy, and that will pay off later at [the 
Western Water Polo Association Championships].”  

  In their match against Pacific, UCSD fared much bet-
ter. Pacific narrowed UCSD’s lead to 6-5, but senior two-
meter defender Steven Donohoe fired in goals to boost 
the Triton advantage to 8-5. In the final period, UCSD’s 
defense held Pacific to zero scores, securing the win.  

With the 2-2 showing at the tournament, the Tritons’ 
record now stands at 9-9 for the season.  

“At this point in the season, it’s all about taking steps 
forward and not backward,” Roberts said. “Right now, we 
need to play more physical ball with a determination.”

UCSD is back in action this Friday, Oct. 16, when the 
Tritons will host the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos.

— become National Champions 
in the 100-meter freestyle and the 
200-meter breaststroke, respectively. 
Additionally, McGihon was recog-
nized as the Pacific Coast Swim and 
Diving Coach of the Year.

In order to live up to their his-
tory, the team will be counting on a 
large contingent of underclassman 
swimmers, who will make up 17 of 
the 23 spots on the men’s roster and 
23 of 29 on the women’s. 

McGihon is quick to quell any 
concern that the underclassmen may 
not be ready. 

“We’re very excited about 
this year’s recruiting class — the 
best we’ve had in school history,” 
McGihon said.

Based on the results of the annual 
intersquad Blue vs. Gold Meet that 
took place on Oct. 10, there is little 
evidence to the contrary. 

McGihon said the meet was a 
good opportunity for the team to  
gauge its strengths and weaknesses. 
The team started its first preseason 
meet off right, collectively breaking 
nine meet records. 

The blue women emerged victo-
rious over their gold-team counter-
parts by a score of 137-126, while the 
gold men held on for a tight 128-126 
victory over the blue team. 

The story of the day, however, 
was the record-breaking perfor-
mances of freshman Adam Rice and 

sophomore Alex Henley, who broke 
two meet records apiece. 

Rice set all-time men’s meet 
records in both the 300-yard indi-
vidual medley and the 150-yard fly. 
Henley did the same in the women’s 
record books, for the 150-yard back-
stroke and the 300-yard individual 
medley.

After his first collegiate-level 
meet, Rice offered a humble reflec-
tion on his performance.

“I tried to keep up a positive 
mindset, and to be OK with how I 
do, but to push my body as far as it 
can in every individual race,” Rice 
said. “I want to hold that mindset 

throughout the rest of the year, since 
it has worked for me so well in the 
past.”

The Tritons’ next meet is on 
Oct. 24, when they host Claremont-
Mudd-Scripps; the meet will again 
be held at the Cathedral Catholic 
High School pool.

“I think our main goal, of course, 
is to better what was done last year,” 
Rice said. “I think this year — with 
all of the fast freshmen we have — 
we can achieve that and most likely 
do more than expected.”

he said. “Bad weather fixes my game.  
A lot of players hit the ball high, but 
I hit it low, so playing in the wind 
doesn’t affect me as much.  It gives me 
an advantage.”

Senior Raj Samra finished one 
stroke behind Okasaki, with back-
to-back rounds of 76. Sophomore 
Michael Tilghman’s performance 
dipped after previously leading the 
Tritons in Washington two weeks ago, 
and junior Brian Olshock played his 
first season  tournament.

 Junior-college transfer Richard 
Morris — finally OKed by the NCAA 
Clearinghouse, after updating his 
amateur status — competed in his first 
Division II tournament as a Triton. 
Morris shot rounds of 77 and 79, 
finishing in a tie for 48th. While he 
was not entirely satisfied with his per-
formance, he did note some big differ-
ences between playing Division II and 
at the junior-college level.

“It was pretty apparent in my first 
event that if you don’t play well, it will 
show,” Morris said. “The competition 
here is at the next level. Some say the 

Division II isn’t the greatest, but there 
is a high level of golf out there.”

  Individually, UCSD is reaching 
top form; however, the men are strug-
gling as a team. Wydra’s squad did not 
post low scores during the opening 
round of either tournament this sea-
son, but seemed to have fewer prob-
lems in rounds two and three.  

The Tritons are averaging nine 
strokes better in the second and third 
rounds, compared to their first round. 

Wydra said the team’s struggle is 
like that of a running back needing 
the first hit of a game before hitting 
his stride.

“We always play better as we get 
going,” Wydra said. “We need to just 
stay in our routine and get into auto-
matic. I also think some of it is team 
chemistry. The teams that have started 
out better than us have been playing 
together longer. If we can get one guy 
going, I think others will follow.”

The Tritons have their top four 
golfers in place, but are still looking 
to fill the all-important fifth spot for 
next week’s Sonoma State Invitational.  
Because collegiate golf uses the best 

four of a team’s five individual scores 
for a team total, the fifth spot provides 
some cushioning.

“It’s hard when two guys play bad 
in the same round,” Okasaki said.  “We 
need that fifth guy to contribute. You 
can’t expect the top four to play well 
every round. It’s just unreasonable.”

Wydra will take Okasaki, Samra, 
Morris, Tilghman and the to-be-
determined fifth player to Sonoma 
next week. Last season, UCSD fin-
ished eighth, with Okasaki and Samra 
finishing in a tie for 24th. 

Considering their familiarity with 
the Sonoma course, both players are 
expected to perform well this week.

“Knowing that I’ve played a couple 
of good rounds on the course before is 
a huge benefit,” Okasaki said.  “It gives 
me confidence knowing that I have 
done well there before. We have been 
really underachieving as a team with 
the talent we have.  I’ve had the chance 
to play with our top four, and we’re all 
starting to play really well.”

HOTCORNERThis Day In History
On Oct. 15, 1923, the New York Yankees 
won their first-ever World Series 
Championship, beating cross-town rival 
the New York Giants 4-2. The title was 
the first of the Yankees majors-best 26 
world championships.

The National League represents everything that is good and pure about the game of baseball, by virtue 
of two simple qualities: All of our pitchers 
hit, and nobody plays in Yankee pinstrips.

Rule changes and money-grubbing 
dynasties not enough to convince you? The 
NL also holds the all-time hits, home runs 
(both tainted and clean) and single-season 
batting-average records. Suck on that, 
American League offenses. 

So now that we've established the NL 
as the best representative of our national 
pastime — and America itself by default — 
let’s take a look at this year’s National League 
Championship Series, and at the two teams 
who will battle it out for the NL Pennant.

This year’s NLCS pits reigning world 
champions the Philadelphia Phillies against 
the (dreaded) Los Angeles Dodgers. Both 
of these teams dominated their respective 
divisions throughout the season, and won 

their division series with relative ease. 
Granted, a Matt Holliday dropped fly 

ball and a Huston Street implosion had just 
as much to do with their victories, but both 
teams are primed for an epic showdown. 
The winner of the showdown, of course, 
gets the privilege of taking down whichever 
overpaid AL team survives the ego-feeding 
photo shoot they call a championship series. 

This marks the fifth time in history 
that the Phillies and Dodgers have faced 
off in the NLCS. Not to mention, it's an 
exact rematch of last year’s championship 
series, —guaranteeing a string of drama and 
history-making moments.

The Dodgers’ chance of winning rests 
largely on which Manny shows up: the 
fertility-fueled hitting machine or the over-
the-hill juicer going through withdrawal. 
With the rise of Andre Eithier and Matt 

The American League represents change. The American League rep-resents development. The American 
League represents the future.

Some feel that the designated-hitter 
rule ripped baseball from its roots. But 
the truth is that having a guy who just 
hits — just like having a person who just 
pitches — is all about specialization. And 
specialization — more than hot dogs, apple 
pie and Oprah — is what defines America. 
That’s exactly why the American League is 
the epitome of our national pastime.

In actuality, baseball is baseball, and 
people who try to point to the discrep-
ancy between the National League and 
American League (small ball vs. long ball) 
are obviously not paying attention to the 
Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Located 
in Orange County off Katella, Though You 
Can Also Take State College Boulevard to 
Get There. 

Since Mike Scioscia took over the 
Angels, the team has been the epitome 
of an American League club sticking to 
National League strategy. Even with sign-
ings of big bats like Vladimir Guerrero 
and the rental of Mark “Pussy-Whipped” 
Teixeira, the Angels have maintained a 
philosophy of getting on base, moving 
runners, manufacturing runs and trusting 
their pitching staff to maintain any lead 
they’ve built. The strategy led the team to 
their first World Series in 2002, when they 
defeated the Giants with such soon-to-be-
forgotten stalwarts as Scott Spiezio, Brad 
Fullmer, Aaron Sele, Kevin Appier and the 
very un-ace-like Jarrod Washburn.

The Angels’ strength this season has 
been its resilience and depth following the 
death of pitcher Nick Adenhart. When 
other teams are pitching to get to former

SWIMMING & DIVING — The UCSD swimming 
and diving team has faced some very serious chal-
lenges at the start of the 2009-10 season — but 
if its record-breaking first meet is any indicator, 
there shouldn’t be much more trouble in the water.

Though the team’s practices are usually held at 
Canyon View Aquatic Center, players and coaches 
were forced to move their preparations to nearby 
Cathedral Catholic High School when the UCSD 
steam room exploded. Needless to say, early sea-
son preparations have not been ideal.

“We’ve had to make a lot of sacrifices and com-

promises without trying to compromise training,” 
head coach Scott McGihon said. “We’re in a posi-
tion now of having to drive down to Coronado, 
where we train for three to four hours at a high 
school.”

Adding to the Tritons’ location problems is a 
rocky transition period to a new set of competi-
tors after losing several key members of the strong 
2008-09 squad. 

During last year’s campaign both the men and 
women’s teams won the Pacific Coast Swimming 
Conference Championships in Long Beach, send-
ing a combined 26 student athletes to the NCAA 
Division II National Championships.

MEN’S WATER POLO — Competing 
alongside several of the nation’s top 
teams, the No. 11 men’s water-polo 
team returned from their Southern 
California tournament, from Oct. 10 
to Oct., 11 with mixed results.  

The Tritons split their games 
on both days of the UC Irvine 
Invitational, first falling 10-6  to long-
time rival No. 5 Loyola Marymount 
before picking up an 8-5 win over No. 
13 Pacific. Day two saw the Tritons 
lose a hard-fought game 8-7 to No. 9 
UC Irvine, but they ended on a high 
note when UCSD defeated No. 12 
UC Davis for the third consecutive 
time this season, in a resounding 11-4 
victory.     

“In college polo, it’s important to 
be able to swim up and down the pool 
at an elite level,” senior driver Sean 
Roberts said. “In the games against 
UC Davis and Pacific, we played up 
to the physicality that both teams 
brought. It was actually fun getting 
into it with them. The same can be 
said about Irvine. It was a hard physi-
cal game, and we just came up short 
one goal in the end.” 

The Tritons put together a bal-
anced attack with seven players 
contributing offensively. Holding a 
slight 3-2 advantage at the end of the 
first quarter, UCSD then scored the 
first four goals of the second quarter 
to snatch a 7-2 lead and ultimately 
gain control of the contest. On solid 
defense, the Tritons held the Aggies to 
one goal in the second half, enabling 
UCSD to cruise to an 11-4 win.

Senior Steven Donohoe led the 
Tritons with three goals. Senior driver 
Bryce Madsen and junior driver Ryan 
Allred added two goals apiece. Senior 
utility Ian Bausback, senior drivers 
Sean Roberts and Kneif Lohse and 
junior driver Sean Cruz also scored 
toward UCSD’s win. 

Earlier that day, the Tritons 
faced the UC Irvine Anteaters for 
what would be a well-fought match.

MEN’S GOLF — Gusty winds and a 
steady downpour forced tournament 
officials to suspend play after only 
two rounds at the Oct. 12 InterWest 
Wildcat Classic. The Tritons fin-
ished in a soggy eighth place at the 
rain-shortened event, and are now 
fine-tuning for the Sonoma State 
Invitational on Oct. 19 to Oct. 20.  

A rarity on the West Coast, the 
suspended tournament was the first 
since the 2005-06 season, when the 
downpour was so heavy that players 
were using bunker rakes to squeegee 
water from the greens. Head coach 
Mike Wydra asked for play to be sus-
pended at that tournament, much like 
he did this week in Chico.

“The veteran coaches took a look 
at the weather report and lobbied 
against starting [the third round],” 
he said. “Once you start the round, 
you have to finish it. The game stops 
being a test of golf ability and starts 
being a test of the bad conditions.  
Eighty-three becomes a good score, 
and no one wants to shoot a good 
eighty-three.”

Junior Keith Okasaki, who sur-
vived winds gusting upward of 45 
mph,  and was the low man for UCSD 
on the 6,906 yard, par 72 Butte Creek 
Country Club course. His total of 151 
tied him for 26th place. 

Okasaki struggled through the first 
14 holes on Monday, before Wydra 
provided him a crucial swing tip that 
turned his game around.

“It was something simple that 
made a big change,” Okasaki said. 
“I was really struggling, so I asked if 
[Wydra] could follow me and give me 
some advice. It’s a bad habit, and the 
same problem I had in Washington.”

After Wydra’s tip, Okasaki finished 
his final three holes of the first round 
one-under par, and cruised through 
round two at even-par.  Having finally 
found the glitch in his swing, he was 
looking forward to the third round, 
but Mother Nature wasn’t having it.

“I really wanted to keep playing,”
