Police continued to investigate 
an alleged sexual assault case involv-
ing a UCSD graduate student and  
unknown assailant last week. The 
assault took place at the univer-
sity-owned Mesa residential apart-
ment complex on the 9200 block 
of Regents Road on the afternoon 
of Nov. 7.

The suspect reportedly entered 
the young woman’s apartment 
through an unlocked front door 
where he allegedly restrained the 
victim, demanded money and sexu-
ally assaulted her.

The suspect is described as a 
20- to 30-year-old, 160-pound 
Caucasian male between 5’6 and 5’9, 
with brown, neck-length hair and 
a goatee. Authorities said the sus-
pect was wearing a white Chargers 
T-shirt, jeans, a backpack and a 
baseball cap, and is believed to have 
been armed with a knife during 
the encounter. According to UCSD 
Chief of Police Orville King, his 
identity was unknown to the vic-
tim. 

Offenses of this nature are rela-

tively uncommon, according to 
campus crime statistics, which cite 
six sex offenses by force in 2005, two 
in 2006 and two in 2007. Of these 
incidents, five were reported to have 
occurred on campus, three others in 
on-campus residential life buildings 
and one on off-campus property. 

King said that to his knowledge, 
there have been no reports of simi-
lar incidents to which case could be 
linked.  

The UCSD Police Department 
has yet to release any specific details 
relating to the case, withholding 
information such as whether any 
suspects have been questioned in 
connection with the incident. 

Police are hopeful, however, that 
flyers containing a composite sketch 

of the suspect will help solve the 
case. King notes that the flyers have 
been circulated among local law 
enforcement agencies.

King said that while the UCSD 
Police Department will be leading 
the case, it will also be collaborat-
ing with other departments in their 
investigation of the incident. 

“We are working with all the 
local police departments on this 
case,” King said. 

Authorities are encouraging any-
one who might have information 
regarding the case to contact the 
UCSD Police Department at (858) 
534-4359.

Web Tool to Ease Financial-Aid Process

local law enforcement;
authorities yet to release 
information regarding

Over 150 graduate students 
attended a forum Monday to express 
discontent with the newly imple-
mented changes to the graduate 
housing contract, a policy which  
over 600 students learned in October 
would require them to vacate their 
affiliated residences over the next 
several months. Dean of Graduate 
Studies Kim Barrett and Director 
of Housing and Dining Mark 
Cunningham addressed the crowd.

The meeting, which was orga-
nized by Graduate Student 
Association President Nick Saenz, 
Vice President of Internal Affairs 
Melanie Zauscher along with Barrett 
and Cunningham, served as both 
an informative session on the new 
graduate housing changes and an 
open forum for students to voice 
opinions on the new policy. 

“The primary function [of the 
meeting] was information,” Saenz 
said. “There was a lot of confusion 
over exactly what was happening, 
and that wasn’t very well commu-
nicated with the students. We really 
wanted an opportunity to see each 
other face to face. It was an oppor-
tunity for students to express their 
views.” 

Barrett began the meeting by 
offering an explanation for the 
change, informing attendees that the 
new policy was enacted to enhance 
community and to ease the tran-
sition for incoming students. The 
policy, which will eventually pro-
vide a two-year housing contract for 
all first-year graduate students, was 
implemented to ease the pressure 
of finding housing in a potentially 

unfamiliar city and to foster com-
munity between disciplines.

“[The changes] will build a grad-
uate community by better integrat-
ing new students to the campus,” 
Barrett said. 

The contractual reform was 
heavily influenced by a GSA survey 
completed three years ago, which 
reported that a majority of gradu-
ate students did not feel they were 
part of a community. In response, 
the Graduate and Professional 
Student Experience and Satisfaction 
Committee released a report finding 
that “early placement [in housing 
would] enhance student recruitment 
and maximize the educational and 
social benefit.”

However, structural engineering 
graduate student Anna Lang said 
that the new changes will have an 
adverse effect on recruitment. The 
previous plan guaranteed housing 
for the extent of a graduate student’s 
studies, providing that academic 
standards were met, and she said 
the new one-year housing offer will 
likely discourage prospective stu-
dents from choosing UCSD due to 
the uncertainty of stable housing, 
especially for those pursuing doc-
toral degrees.

“With regards to recruitment, I 
just don’t buy it,” Lang said. “I was 
recruited to come here and there’s 
no way a 12-month guarantee will 
bring new people. A lot of depart-
ment recruiters agree. It’s just not a 
positive tool.”

According to a petition presented 
to Barrett and Cunningham that was 
drafted in opposition to the poli-
cy change, the new housing policy 
“inhibits efforts to build graduate 
student community, undermines 
retention of our current colleagues, 
and threatens the recruitment of 
future graduate students.” 

The petition, which contains over 
1,000 graduate student signatures, 
addresses the changes that affect all

A new online financial-aid tool 
unveiled this week allows depen-
dent students living on campus to 
view a personalized projection of 
the amount of financial aid they can 
expect to receive upon enrollment at 
any of the UC campuses. 

By entering personal information 
such as annual student and family 
income, assets, family size and the 

number of family members attend-
ing college, students and their par-
ents are provided an estimated cost 
of attendance, the amount of grant 
and scholarship assistance they are 
eligible to receive and their expected 
contribution to the remaining net 
cost. 

“We anticipate that many pro-
spective students, those current 
high school seniors and their fami-
lies, will be using this in the com-
ing months,” UCSD Director of 
Financial Aid Ann Klein said. “Also, 
current students may be interested 
in reviewing the calculator to see 
what happens when their family’s 
financial circumstances change.”

Though the online estima-
tor for UCSD was made available 
this September, the tool was offi-

cially launched systemwide earlier 
this week when all campuses were 
ready.  

“Families are understandably 
anxious about rising college costs, 
a tightening credit market and an 
uncertain economy,” UC President 
Mark G. Yudof said. “But I believe 
this new Web-based tool will reas-
sure many students and their fami-
lies that a UC education is indeed 
within their reach. In some cases, 
families may be truly surprised 
by the amount of scholarship and 
grant aid they would be eligible to 
receive.”

Prior to the availability of this 
tool, students were not able to 
approximate how they might finance

UCSD announced its plans to 
upstart multiple new programs 
in preparation for the expected 
rise in student veterans who have 
served in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Initiatives include a special ori-
entation for student veterans, early 
enrollment privileges and outreach 
efforts to local community col-
leges and military bases.

“I’ve noticed an increased 
interest from veterans who want 
to seek out educational opportu-
nities at UC San Diego,” Student 
Affairs Officer Jed Schlueter said. 
“More current military members 
have also been calling, or have 
approached me at college fairs.”

UCSD’s first orientation for stu-
dent veterans, which took place 
in September, featured guest 
speakers from the Student Affairs, 
Financial Aid and Counseling and 
Psychological Services depart-
ments, who highlighted the oppor-
tunities available to orientees.

“It’s essential we support our 

veteran students and help them 
find their niche on our campus,” 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Penny Rue said. “Many of our stu-
dents are right out of high school, 
but veterans typically have much 
more life experience so it’s impor-
tant we recognize their service 
and help them make the transition 
to UC San Diego.”

Since last Spring Quarter, stu-
dent veterans and staff from the 
Transfer Services, Student Affairs 
and Financial Aid departments, 
along with the six colleges, have 
participated in a Veterans Services 
Workgroup whose first initiative 
is to implement priority course 
registration for student veterans 
beginning this winter.

Last year, students Erik Matson 
and Kenyon Ralph co-founded the 
Student Veteran Organization to 
encourage current student veter-
ans to help incoming peers adjust 
to campus life. The organization 
meets regularly and is currently 
recruiting new members.

In addition, CPS recently cre-
ated a student veterans support 
group to provide additional emo-

tional support for students from 
fellow vets.

A postdoctoral urology 
researcher at UC San Francisco 
has been charged with attempted 
murder after admitting that he twice 
tried to poison a colleague by con-
taminating her drinking water with 
laboratory chemicals, a university 
spokeswoman said Tuesday.

Benchun Liu, 38, was arrested 
Nov. 7 after he allegedly told lab 
technician and research assistant 
Mei Cao that he had tried to kill 
her, police said.

“If he hadn’t have told her, we 
would have had no idea he was 
doing this,” UCSF Police Captain 
Paul Berlin said.

Liu and Cao work together in the 
Baskin Lab on UCSF’s Parnassus 
campus. 

Liu, a Chinese citizen working 
in the country on a visa, is being 
detained in the San Francisco 
County Jail on an immigration 

hold. No bail information has been 
released.

According to police, Liu said 
he had been “stressed out” lately, 
but investigators have determined 
no other possible motivations for 
the crime.

Berlin said that in both poison-
ing attempts, Liu used a buffer 
agent that controls acid in lab 
solutions and turns water blue, but 
Cao drank it anyway.

“It was discolored; she noticed 
it,” he said. “She did swallow some 
of the contents. She claimed to 
have no reaction, but that is short 
term. We don’t know what the long-
term impact will be on her body.”

Cao was examined at the UCSF 
Medical Center and released, 
Berlin said, adding that she was 
unable to say why Liu might have 
wanted to kill her. 

“They had just a working rela-
tionship — no romantic relation-
ship,” he said. “They both work 
in the lab, and I guess there is 
some competition in the lab. You 
could speculate for days. But what 
was exactly on his mind, only he 
knows.”

students who moved in after Oct. 
1. The new policy implements a 
transition stage within the housing 
process, an effort to accommodate 
current contracted and waitlisted 
students while adapting to the new 
system as quickly as possible. 

Under the changes, students who 
entered the housing contract after 
Sept. 30 will be given primary resi-
dency status and allotted a nonre-
newable one-year rental agreement. 
After one year, students may not 
reapply for housing.

Secondary tenants — those not 
listed as the primary contact on 
a lease  — will be evicted upon 
the departure of the primary ten-
ant. However, if the primary ten-
ant vacates before Dec. 1 and the 
secondary tenant has resided in the 
apartment for at least a year, the 
secondary tenant may take over the 
lease for the remaining duration of 
the rental agreement. 

Bob Haushalter, a biochemistry 
graduate student, had been on the 
waitlist since February 2006 and 
found housing through a friend, who 
was a primary tenant. Haushalter 

signed his lease as a secondary ten-
ant in January 2008. Under the new 
policy, he will be forced to leave at 
the beginning of next year when the 
primary tenant moves out, something 
he did not expect upon signing the 
contract.

“I would not have moved if I 
knew I was going to get kicked out,” 
he said. “I moved into the Mesas 
under the assumption that when my 
roommate got his Ph.D. that I would 
take over the primary position. I 
don’t see the problem with the [pre-

vious] system where I take over the 
primary after a year. Grad students 
are moving in with grad students 
they know as opposed to strangers.”  

Saenz agreed that the administra-
tion is moving in the right direction 
with the new policy, but said the 
changes in their current form serve 
to harm the graduate student com-
munity. 

“Ultimately, I think it will be 
an admirable long-term goal,” Saenz 
said. “It’s sort of how we get there in 
the short term that is difficult. Based 
on comments last night, there was a 
general understanding that priori-
tization would be a good thing, but 
people are hurt by the unforeseen 
nature [of the policy change]. It’s 
very disruptive and chaotic to the 
community.”

There is currently an appeal 
process for individual situations 
with “extenuating circumstances.” 
The Affiliated Housing Advisory 
Committee, a predominantly stu-
dent-run committee, will consider all 
such appeals.

Saenz: Admin Has Right Intentions, but Policy Too Sudden
▶ HOUSING, from page 1

Last night’s A.S. meeting was filled with outrageous com-ments and rapid-fire decisions 
as discussion over the Loft referendum 
finally drew to a close. The meeting 
began with a short spiel by Thurgood 
Marshall senior Robert Corea during 
public input plugging tomorrow’s rally 
against Proposition 8, the recent state 
gay-marriage ban.

“This is an issue about civil rights,” 
Corea said. “We should be leading 
the charge as an institution of higher 
education.”

Following public input, President 
Donna Bean 
moved to 
appoint Associate 
Vice President 
of Student 
Advocacy Frank 
Carroll as the 
Special Election 
Campaign Manager for the activity fee 
referendum in January.  

“I believe my qualifications are 
exemplary,” Carroll said. He proceed-
ed to detail his qualifications for the 
position and the motion to appoint 
him passed.

Next, Sixth College Senator 
John Cressey unveiled the new Loft 
Memorandum of Understanding, 
which the Special Committee on 
the Loft kneaded out with Director 
of University Events Office Martin 
Wollesen throughout the past week.

“I want to reiterate that this is 
nothing more than putting this on a 
ballot,” Cressey said.  “Vote in favor of 
student control by letting the students 
decide.”

Associate Vice President of 
Academic Affairs Lana Blank told her 
colleagues that she finds their practice 
of snapping to indicate approval quite 
distracting before diving into com-
mentary on the Loft.

“If you’ve built it, then why not 

give it a few years to try it out?” Blank 
said.  “Students would survive without 
Sun God, but they want it, just like 
they want the Loft. So let’s give them 
the choice.”

“I would urge the council to con-
sider the opinions of groups that are 
not necessarily affiliated with them,” 
Intrafraternity Council representative 
Luke Pulaski said. “I would like to 
think of A.S. as a council that can get 
things done.”

While the council stewed over the 
language of the Loft referendum MoU, 
Associate Vice President of Student 

O r g a n i z a t i o n s 
Utsav Gupta 
clicked photos of 
fellow council-
members from 
various points 
around the room.  
The photos, he 

said, are for his photography class 
project on diverse social spheres.

Two hours after the commence-
ment of the meeting, the council final-
ly voted on the issue of the Loft refer-
endum.  The motion failed by a mere 
four votes, meaning that the Loft will 
not be added to the A.S. activity fee 
referendum or make an appearance 
on the ballot at the special election in 
January.  

Wollesen graciously accepted the 
council’s decision and thanked coun-
cilmembers for the time they took to 
debate the issue of the Loft’s funding 
over the past several weeks.

During open forum, members of 
the council urged each other to partic-
ipate in the No on Proposition 8 rallies 
that are to take place on campus and in 
Hillcrest this coming weekend.

To everyone’s glee, the meeting 
ended without having to be relo-
cated from the forum due to time 
constraints for the first time in three 
weeks.

a UC education until they had been 
accepted, had filled out an applica-
tion for financial aid and received 
an award letter. 

Students are now able to compare 
the costs of attending a UC campus 
and create a projected financial plan 
even before they have applied. 

UC spokesman Ricardo Vazquez 
said he doesn’t believe that the dif-
ferences in financial aid projected 
by the estimator will be the deter-
mining factor for students in the 
process of choosing which UC cam-
pus to attend. 

“The variations in aid between 
different UC campuses would vary a 
little bit, and I don’t think they would 
necessarily be a deciding factor for a 
student [within the UC system],” he 
said. “Students make those decisions 
based on many factors, financial aid 
being just one of them.”

Klein is optimistic that using 
the tool will demonstrate to many 
students and their families that a 
UCSD education is affordable, and 
encourage them to apply for finan-
cial aid. 

“More than half of our under-
graduates receive some form of 

need-based support,” Klein said. “A 
third of our undergraduates receive 
the federal Pell Grant for low-
income students. This is far more 
than at comparable national univer-
sities. The average gift aid awarded 
is about $10,300 a year, and by using 
the calculator, students and families 
will see that a UC San Diego educa-
tion is possible.”

After letting the state title slip last season, members of the UCSD women’s soccer team 
were ecstatic to crush California 
Collegiate Athletic Association rival 
Cal State Dominguez Hills and 
reclaim the crown on Nov. 9 in a 
decisive 3-1 victory that featured 
aggressive defense and surprising 
performances by two up-and-com-
ing freshmen who scored their first 
goals of the season.

But despite winning the coveted 
championship, which vaults the No. 
19 Tritons into contention for the 
national NCAA Division-II title, fan 
support remains virtually nonex-
istent. The sidelines were practi-
cally empty for the duration of the 
regular season, even though many 
matches, including the champion-
ship, were held at our very own 
Triton Soccer Field. 

The No. 11 women’s volleyball 
and No. 8 men’s water polo teams 
are also set to make the playoffs this 
year, and the same problem contin-
ues to haunt both of those squads: 
Other than the handful of members 
who make up diehard school spirit 
crew Triton Tide and a few dedicated 
friends and family members, UCSD 
students don’t really seem to care 
very much about campus athletics, 
and strong performances by our best 
teams often go unnoticed by the aver-
age undergraduate.

It was just two academic years 
ago that students voted to increase 
yearly intercollegiate athletics fees 
by $234 in an emotionally charged 
referendum dubbed by supporters as 
critical to maintaining campus spirit 
and community and opponents as, 
well, a waste of money. The referen-
dum passed with a healthy 12-point 
margin and garnered a 42 percent 
voter participation rate, a stunning 
showing on a campus historically 
plagued by apathy (last year only 
9 percent of students voted in the 
general A.S. election).

Since then, bleachers and sidelines 
remain as cricket infested as ever, 
a blinding contradiction that leaves 
this board wondering just how much 
the beefed-up athletics department 
improves campus life when almost 
no one save the athletes even bothers 
showing up for a game. 

Students continue to dismiss ath-
letics, and the department — now 
with loads more money to its name 
— is still failing in its attempts to 
boost visibility, leaving the hardwork-
ing athletes the biggest losers of all, 
even when they’re winning.

You’re Paying for Those Empty Box Seats, You Know
BEN HOLM/GUARDIAN

Nov. 4 is a day that will be remembered in the United States forever. A day that 
changed our nation as much as the 
Civil War, Pearl Harbor and Sept. 
11 combined. A day that changed 
the lives of Americans in ways that 
will reverberate through subsequent 
generations as much as any event in 
our young nation’s history. And while 
citizens of both the United States 
and the world will feel the effects of 

the change that has taken place in 
America on this day, San Diegans 
will shoulder the burden in a much 
more tangible way. Because, as of last 
week, it is no longer legal to consume 
alcohol on the beaches of San Diego 
County.

That’s right — Proposition D 
passed with flying colors, making 
it illegal to enjoy an adult beverage 
while the tide rolls up and tickles your 
feet as you lounge in a comfy beach 
chair. No longer can the good people 
of San Diego drink beer and attempt 
to play various drinking games such 
as horseshoes and bocce ball, all the 
while enjoying the pristine weather 
that we of Southern California are 
continually blessed with. There are 
many who said that Election Day 2008 
was a great victory for civil rights — 
the culmination of years of struggle 
and perseverance against oppression 
and prejudice. And while some may 
feel liberated, I feel trapped. Trapped 
in a world where I cannot imbibe the 
beverage of my choice in a neighbor-
hood where I pay extra rent to live 
near the beach.

The long, heated battle over beach 
drinking came to a head on Labor 
Day 2007 in the bustling enclave of 
Pacific Beach. Some revelers who 
apparently had a few too many started 
a fight, bottles were thrown and chaos 
ensued. With the drunken masses 
temporarily crazed, police and riot 
teams stepped in with batons in hand 
to try and calm the raging crowds. 
Now legendary YouTube videos show 
how many of the offenders had little 
regard for the policemen, attempt-
ing to attack them as though they 
were part of the holiday festivities. 
By the time it was all over, more than 
a dozen people were arrested and 
the drinking landscape had shifted 
forever. 

The San Diego City Council 
moved to temporarily ban drinking 
on San Diego beaches until the issue 
could be brought to a vote through a 
referendum on the Nov. 4 ballot. That 
referendum was named Proposition 
D and soon after its introduction, the 
lawns of beachside homes were dot-
ted with both “Yes on D” and “No on 
D” signs. Web sites were created and 
press conferences were held. It was 
obvious that this ban wasn’t going to 
go through without a fight as both 
sides sought to maximize their politi-
cal maneuvering to secure victory.  

As a proud resident of Pacific 
Beach, I awoke that Tuesday with 
great anxiety and profound concern

SIX COLLEGES — If you’re a weath-
ered UCSD student, you’re well aware 
of the unique personality that each of 
the six colleges has. You know that 
Eleanor Roosevelt College has the new-
est dorms and that John Muir College 
has the chilled-out surfer vibe, equipped 
with its very own surf shop. You also 
know that ERC’s Making of the Modern 
World is a pain in the ass, while Revelle 
College has the shittiest cafeteria. 
Everyone loves Thurgood Marshall 
College for the late-night breakfast bur-
rito binge OceanView Terrace provides, 
while most freshmen steer clear of Sixth 
College, because where is Sixth anyway? 
It doesn’t even have a real name! 

But high-school seniors going 
through the lengthy application pro-
cess don’t have any of this information 
to help them decide where to spend 
the next four years. UCSD requires its 
applicants to rank the six colleges in 
order of preference. Each college has 
its own Web site, stocked with enough 
quotes and mission statements to make 
anyone’s head spin, and a pretty picture 
of each resident hall. It’s based on these 
portrayals that naive applicants try to 
decide which college is the coolest, nic-
est, easiest or whatever else they’re look-

ing for. When applying to what now 
seems like 50 colleges at once, your last 
priority is to search through Web pages, 
talk to students already at UCSD or pay 
a firsthand visit just to accurately rank 
your choices. For the most part, appli-
cants rank the colleges based on name 
recognition, proximity to the beach or 
dorm quality.  

Applicants who chose ERC because 
of its mission statement (to “promote 
the creation of internationally minded, 
culturally aware students and citizens”) 
were not aware, for example, that a 
six-quarter-long history class would 
consume our lives for two whole years. 
Applicants who chose ERC because 
of its brand-new, ocean-view resident 
halls boasting a common room bigger 
than their family’s living room never 
dreamed that there was a good chance 
they’d get shipped off to the boondocks 
that are the Revelle fleets. If housing is 
the main draw to a certain college, being 
forced to live in buildings modeled after 
barracks from the 1960s with remnants 
of the Vietnam War bloodshed on the 
carpet and actual holes in the wall is not 
going to make a freshman feel at home. 
Many Marshall College freshmen are 
experiencing this same disappointment, 
filling an entire building in Revelle. 

“I wasn’t even going to live on cam-
pus because I have a sister who goes 

here, but I loved Thurgood Marshall 
housing so I made the deposit,” said 
Marshall freshman Thuan Byun. 
“When I found out I wasn’t even going 
to live there, I was really pissed. I don’t 
feel like I’m a Marshall student at all. It’s 
very excluding being on the outskirts 
of campus.”

Ignoring half of the reasons we 
chose a college in the first place makes 
the whole process ridiculous. Our par-
ticipation in activities, the general-edu-
cation requirements and, most impor-
tantly, living among our peers is what 
links each student to their college. The 
six-college system is meant to provide 
a consolidated community to our giant 
campus, and UCSD takes that away by 
not guaranteeing housing in your own 
college. If Marshall students chose their 
college mostly for OVT’s bomb reputa-
tion, how are they supposed to deal 
with Plaza’s moldy bread every day? If 
you chose Muir for the chill vibe, with 
El Mercado at your beck and call, noth-
ing else quite cuts it. Each college’s Web 
site provides a very generalized descrip-
tion of its goals, but the details that 
really matter aren’t properly presented 
to applicants. If we’re not even going to 
live in our alleged college, what’s the use 
of ranking them anyway? 

“To be honest, I had no idea that 
there was even a six-college system at 

UCSD,”  ERC freshman Bianca Armenta 
said. “I ranked Eleanor Roosevelt first 
because it was the only name I recog-
nized out of the six.” 

Armenta said if she’d known more 
about the colleges, she would have cho-
sen differently to find a college that bet-
ter suits her academic goals. 

Granted, UCSD has thousands of 
applicants to consider so it needs some 
sort of across-the-board system to make 
sorting and matching easier and fair 
for each prospective student. It seems 
more appropriate to have students 
choose their top choices after they are 
accepted, once they have the opportu-
nity for extensive tours and more inclu-
sive research. But UCSD also needs a 
massive Web site overhaul. Instead of 
vague mottos and quotations, colleges 
should provide extensive G.E. require-
ment details, and represent the dorms 
more realistically. Tour guides should 
be get more college-specific training so 
they can provide useful information to 
applicants, rather than the general “here 
is where they eat!” crap. Until then, hav-
ing us believe we choose our fate here 
is misleading. And a note of advice for 
applicants: If it’s between having a triple 
or Revelle, choose the triple.

Don’t Dive in — College Ranking Pool Shallow at Both Ends

The sticky situation in which secondary-tenant graduate students and graduate-hous-
ing administrators now find them-
selves is not easily pinned on any 
one culprit, but one thing is clear: a 
two-month eviction notice without 
any grounds but the out-of-nowhere 
inspiration to enhance the student 
community is likely to have rather the 
opposite effect.

In order to implement any sort 
of change in the system, there is an 
unavoidable transition period; and 
in this case, the decision to limit 

guaranteed graduate housing to two 
years (or one year for the time being, 
until the lengthy and problematic 
waitlist has dried up) is a positive 
one. As many undergrads know all 
too well, one year on campus — or, 
in the case of Mesa graduate housing, 
as close as you can get without actu-
ally being on campus — is often just 
enough, sufficient as an introduction 
to La Jolla’s surrounding maze of 
palms and pavement but just awful 
enough to instill a craving for a little 
commuter action. Housing officials 
could easily stir a more diverse and 

complete graduate community under 
the new policy, rotating grads of all 
disciplines in just long enough to get 
a taste of each other and the area.

However, housing administra-
tors should simultaneously take into 
account that this mess — the impos-
sible waitlist, the unregulated flow of 
secondary tenants taking the spots of 
those long in line — was completely 
self-created. Renters generally hold 
far more rights than their landlords, 
and for good reason: If the Man lets 
us squat for years without so much 
as a second glance, he doesn’t just 

get to decide one morning he wants 
a more qualified tenant. The rough-
ly 200 secondaries being kicked to 
the curb next quarter, and hundreds 
more in the months to come, have 
legally made their homes in the Mesa 
housing, regardless of the university’s 
newfound penchant for communal 
perfection.

UCSD Housing should have 
instead honored incoming graduates 
at a more labored pace, one that 
allowed for honorable clean-up of 
their own misdoing before ushering 
in hasty improvements.

Dear Editor,
I’d like to clarify one of my quotes 

in the Nov. 10 Grove Caffe article.
I strongly believe the Grove is nec-

essary, as are all other student enter-
prises. In no circumstance should we 
close a student enterprise, because they 
are important for students in order 
to be self-sustaining. I just wanted to 
make sure that our enterprises are suc-
cessful. My project is not about inter-
viewing heads of enterprises. I fully 
support the job they are doing as long 
as it is in the interest of the students.

A.S. Senator,

Dear Editor,
In response to your Oct. 30 edito-

rial on Thurgood Marshall College’s 
Dimensions of Culture writing pro-
gram, I’d like to clarify a few key points. 
D.O.C. is a program we are very proud 
of and it has benefited from two sig-
nificant college reviews from affiliated 
Marshall College faculty and students 
issued last academic year. Our col-
lege is following the key initiatives 
from these two published reports still 
found on our Web site. A central rec-
ommended initiative was to bring in 
senior ladder-rank professors to direct 
the program. Former D.O.C. Director 
Abraham Shragge supports D.O.C. by 
teaching D.O.C. 100 for our transfer 
students and by blueprinting an upper 
division public service D.O.C. course 

that we hope to launch next autumn.  
The “Public Service D.O.C.” course is 
a chief idea coming from our student 
committee on D.O.C.  In keeping with 
the D.O.C. reports, our new co-direc-
tors of D.O.C. — professors Robert 
Horwitz and Robert Cancel — are 
doing an outstanding job of recruit-
ing new ladder-rank faculty for 2009, 
and in the process they are redesigning 
the entire D.O.C. sequence. Moreover, 
we now have three senior ladder-rank 
faculty (two from UCSD and one from 
California Western School of Law), 
which is a dramatic improvement 
from the previous year.  Finally, our 
college, in partnership with Eleanor 
Roosevelt College, created a six-day 
symposium on Human Rights and 
Global Citizenship (Nov. 17 through 
Nov. 22) with renowned speakers such 
as the father of Chicano theater Luis 
Valdez, Oscar-nominated filmmaker 
Greg Nava and Harvard law professor 
Jacqueline Bhabha. The symposium is 
an essential component of D.O.C. With 
these thoughts I sincerely believe you 
could have fleshed out a richer portrait 
of D.O.C. in healthy transition.

Provost, Thurgood Marshall College

THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN By Niven Wilson

that the lifestyle I had come to enjoy 
would soon be a thing of the past. 
Sure, there were other important 
measures on the ballot concerning 
things like animal cruelty and gay 
rights, but this was beach drinking we 
were talking about, an invaluable civil 
liberty that has given me profound 
joy many a time. An inalienable right 
that the Founding Fathers just hap-
pened to leave out of the Constitution 
and the Bill of Rights in their hurry 

to get the thing passed. As the results 
rolled in, it was clear that Proposition 
D would pass. The atmosphere at the 
local watering hole that night was 
somber as people could no longer 
look forward to a weekend filled with 
sunbathing and mojitos. Just another 
group of victims of this thing we call 
a democracy.

As the shockwave of Proposition 
D has subsided I have begun to 
accept the decision that was made by 
the people of San Diego. As a student 

of politics, I understand that legisla-
tion is one thing and oversight is 
another. It will take a decent amount 
of creativity to shirk the ban — gigan-
tic margaritas in soccer-mom sized 
thermoses are a good place to start, I 
think. But while others rejoice, I will 
always remember Nov. 4 as the day I 
lost something. A day when a little 
part of me went cold. The days of 
freely drinking on the beach may be 
gone, but the memory of better days 
will live on in our hearts forever.

THEIR FIRE’S SO DELIGHTFUL
NAVEL-GAZERS WARM OUR SOCKS WITH TOASTY FOLKLORE     

A s its swan lights dim to honey, the Loft melts off a little of that overreaching hip factor. Plush gallery furnishing isn’t quite as forbidding with the warmth of people filling 
out its stark white-and-lime corners. While it might be some 
time before UCSD’s newest performance lounge earns that all-
powerful dance-party draw, the space does prove well equipped 
for humbler occasions — such as this month’s Folk Series, which 
hosts a revival of the humbler sort. And maybe, like a shiny pair 
of shoes, that’s just the kind of living-in the Loft needs to scuff 
its place on the campus’ social front.

Last Sunday’s lineup of scraggly young folkies (cocktail 
nibbles were swapped for scones) felt just right: an almost crowd-
level stage — oft overwhelmed by one too many crammed 
musicians — catered comfortably to the solo acts. As November 
fogged the windows overlooking the Student Services Center 
parking lot, a sizeable audience cushioned one faint spotlight in 
collective hush. This was a place where even no-name MySpace 
hopefuls could play to an intermittent head-nod and attentive ear 
walk-ins welcome. 

Denison Witmer was quick to comment on the eerie polite-
ness of it all, tucking his mousy side-bang behind one ear. 
“When I play at the Casbah, it’s like, me versus airplanes.” Easy 
to imagine the rumpled poet swept by stock-nightclub clamor, 
his sleepy pillow fluff lost like so many dandelion seeds in the 
wind. Apparently giddy with undivided attention, Witmer’s 
chitchat soon swelled to neo-rodeo campfire as he shared long-
winded gripes on PT Cruisers, and L.A. snobs who rattle on 
about pointless things.

Fortunately for the cozy Lofters, the Philly rambler’s tunes 
didn’t bear the tedium of his indulgent storytelling. “Carry the

“The Conversation”

Plucked from the Golden Age of modern American cinema, “The 
Conversation” features Coppola at his middle-aged prime in the gloomy 
milieu of the ‘70s. Dropping Gene Hackman as a Frisco surveillance sleuth 
recording whispered conversations as lethal as the plague, the possibility 
of surfacing above the radar renders him paranoid at nearly every tap. All it 
takes is one conversation to set off silenced heaters and a war of Big-Brother 
intimidation.  

Coppola’s most underrated gem to date basks in umbral tints and a 
decade-long fetish for Watergate plots infused with murder and hidden 
mayhem. Don’t let it go unseen  — if you know what’s good for you. (EG)

“Quantum of Solace”

Exchanging Pierce Brosnan’s dapper finesse for the devil-may-care 
bravado of a younger man worked well once for the secret agent franchise, 
and “Quantum of Solace” picks up where Bond (Daniel Craig) left off 
– beaten, betrayed and unsurprisingly sex deprived. Eager to investigate the 
organization that blackmailed Vesper, 007 picks a fight with the criminal 
co-op known as “Quantum” and a lady friend with an eastern European 
bombshell (figuratively speaking) by the name of Camille (Olga Kurylenko).

An Esquire in its own cinematic right, “Quantum of Solace” may be a 
men’s rag, but it’s executed with enough style, wit and elegant filmmaking 
to make even the most devout chick-flick enthusiast yearn for the next 
installment. (EG)

Annuals & Minus the Bear

Remember a year-and-a-half ago, when Arcade Fire was the hottest shit on 
the indie block? Makes me feel like an old man. Annuals lead the Fire revival with 
a little more American pizazz to take the edge off the pioneers’ Canadian frost-
pop, hair-metal shredding on “Hot Night Hounds” before going into a tribal, ass-
shaking finale, something Win Butler would surely never attempt. And remember 
when breathy indie-pop gave Zach Braff enough material to write a full-length, 
life-changing film? Minus the Bear could write the sequel, and they even throw a 
’90s history lesson into the mix with cues from Incubus and math-rock. (CK)

T he Boy in the Striped Pajamas,” Mark Herman’s 
2008 adaptation of John Boyne’s 

popular novel, glosses Holocaust 
horrors through the lens of 8-year-old 

naif Bruno (Asa Butterfield), born to a 
Nazi commanding general in the throes of 

war-torn Germany. As his father 
has just been promoted, Bruno is 

whisked from the urban milieu of 
early childhood to a new life waxed in 

austere sterility at “Out-With” — properly 
pronounced Auschwitz.

Bruno spends most of his days lone-
some for the affections of his Nazi-sympa-
thizing sister Gretel (Amber Beattie) and 
kind-enough mother (Vera Farmiga), until 
the day Bruno stumbles across the concentra-
tion-camp gates  — containing, he imagines, 
a strange farm on which everyone wears 
striped pajamas. Through the electric fence 
the little prince befriends Shmuel (Jack 
Scanlon), who becomes Bruno’s only 

friend — and ambassador to a 
reality beyond his cozy 

doormat.

“Pajamas” is a well-crafted piece carried by a simple and 
striking score from James Horner, notably resilient from 
beginning to end. Cinemographic hues are adjusted in accor-
dance with scene progression to emphasize Bruno’s departure 
from the stunning, rich world he’s always known to the bleak, 
gray swaths of “Out-With.” Likewise, each set is ornately 
constructed, accentuating the contrast between daily life for 
outskirting Germans and the emptiness within Auschwitz 

and the too-many more dark 
corners of the Holocaust.

Translating such a well-
known and horrific history 
through a child’s eyes allows 
“Pajamas” a well-executed 

thematic delicacy. For that, the absurd logic on which the 
Holocaust was based is stripped of its angry glare, painted 
with a softer brush more innocent than preachy and render-
ing a more effective (if somewhat juvenile) retrospective 
message.

These themes avoid oversimplicification — thankfully,  
so as issues of hatred, genocide and the role of the “inno-
cent” bystander are some of the most complicated — instead 
thoroughly explored through char-
acters like Bruno’s mother. Deeply 
torn between loyalty to her husband, 
defending her state and what she

THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 2008

BY APRIL STEPHENSON  STAFF WRITER



People don’t give video games enough love — even with the growth of gaming’s cultural rel-
evance since the early ’80s, it remains 
a stigmatized pastime, reserved for 
nerdy kids with too much spare time 
and those generally lacking in social 
grace. No one but the enthusiast 

press has ever taken the industry 
seriously. 

So you can imagine my surprise 
when I came across an article in the 
New Yorker profiling Cliff “CliffyB” 
Bleszinski — the design director of 
Epic Games — and his involvement 
in the highly anticipated title Gears 
of War 2. As a gamer, I should have 
been overjoyed that one of the  coun-
ry’s most regal publications finally 
bestowed video games their overdue 
recognition. But honestly, I was more 
fascinated by the article’s subservient 
awe of CliffyB.  

I’ve always known Bleszinski to 
be an established personality within 
our industry — his arresting charm 
and quick wit in interviews and pre-
sentations has never failed to enter-
tain — but I never quite realized just 
how significant of a figure he actually 
is. Reading the article made me real-
ize something that I should’ve known 
long ago: CliffyB is a fucking rock 
star. Like any relevant rock frontman, 
his image frequently outshines his 
products, and gamers flock to him 
like any groupie would to a famous 
musician or tabloid celebrity. Taking 
this analogy one step further, can the 
same be said for the marketing of his 
products? Is CliffyB capable of con-
juring anticipation for Epic titles by 
wielding his superstar image alone?

To Bleszinski’s credit, the handful 
of titles to which he’s been attached 
tend to speak for themselves. Gears 
of War notwithstanding, the popu-
larity of the Unreal Tournament fran-
chise and even retro titles like Jazz 
Jackrabbit has led me to believe that 
CliffyB is just an exceptional devel-
oper who happens to be extremely 
popular. While he boasts an impres-
sive resume, I wonder if the same 
can also be said for other celebrated 
creators. 

The industry has more than its 
fair share of well-known auteurs, but 
only a handful among them can be 
considered video-game rock stars: 
developers whose brand cachet 
speaks louder than their products; 
says Tomonobu Itagaki or David 
Jaffe.  

Or developer/figurehead Jade 
Raymond. While remaining rela-
tively unknown up until last year, 
Raymond became an instant sensa-
tion when she was first associated 

with Assassin’s Creed, a title founded 
on huge ambition and anticipation. 
If one was to question her overnight 
popularity, I believe it can be attrib-
uted to either/both of the following 
factors: 1. She served as producer and 
spokeswoman to what was deemed 
the spiritual successor to Prince of 
Persia: The Sands of Time, a cher-

FROM BROTHERLY LOVE TO DIRTY-SOUTH TWANG, 
FOLKSTERS SCHOOL THE LOFT’S PEANUT GALLLERY

On board next Sunday, Patrick Park is set to “Arrive with a whisper/ Head out with a bang,” as in last 
year’s Everyone’s in Everyone. With Matt Costa-esque 
shimmies lifting cloudier textures, the singer/song-
writer will undoubtedly fatten the Loft’s repertoire of 
clever young gentlemen. 

Park, a Colorado native, originally favored Metallica 
over Odetta in his headbangin’ boyhood — but a poetic 
mama and blues-loving pops eventually rocked their 
kid’s fancies toward New York, where he arrived with 
delusions of peddling rootsy folk. Like most Big Apple 
romances, though, the love affair soon plummeted 
— L.A. seemed a friendlier place to nourish his dis-
tinguishing mash of Pixies chaos and classic John Lee 
Hooker boogie. A couple self-released demos later, and 
2003’s watertight Loneliness Knows My Name hit the 
shelves. 

If the Loft has ever been accused of lacking a little 
focus, November’s folk series demonstrates the over-
whelming potential of its slightly wobbly, if ambitious, 
programming. With a different act for almost every 
day of the week, there must inevitably be some wiggle 
room for a nightclub still in its second month  — but 
with the drawling cool of Witmer, Stephens and Park, 
the Loft seems destined for a clear-sailing future.

Weight” leaked of strained hippie sweetness, a 
meandering ballad akin to skipping stones on the 
ol‘ family pond. Drowsy-eyed he pressed, “Carry 
the weight of your brother/ Carry the weight of 
your sister (mother, etc.)” and suddenly, the power 
of one guy with his acoustic guitar broke surface, 
each dusty low answered by sharp twangs of clarity. 
Even if his aesthetic evoked re-hashed ’70s anthems, 
there were moments when such introspective scraps 
rattled with grandeur, moving in their impossibly 
gentle humility.

Midway through, positively drugged by acoustic 
showers, the impulse was to either rise and hold our 
neighbor’s hand or fall to the cradling of  heavy-
lidded lullabies. “Are You a Dreamer?” allowed us 
this kind of naptime as Witmer scattered slow coos 
of, “Dream/ Are you a dreamer?/ Do you dream?,” 
turning harplike flutters that never dipped wistful 
in wimp. With an expertly poised honesty, it’s easy 
to see why Witmer’s been tagged as the next Elliot 
Smith — over six years and albums his narratives 
have been buffed to their bare and beautiful essen-
tials. 

The night’s second act Adam Stephens is no 
fresh face to the scene either, despite opening his 
set apologetically by cautioning us that it was only 
his fourth time playing solo. Fourth?! Maybe so, but 
as the former half of bluesy Saddle Creek duo Two 
Gallants, it’s unlikely that the stage is unfamiliar. 
Diverging from Witmer’s easy pulls, the plaid-clad 
grunge kid whipped out his electric guitar for some 
rougher tugging. Where Witmer’s aches trickled 
easy and true, Stephens’ coursed in throbbing heaves 
— dense, dirty strokes braking only at the occasional 
drag for air. 

“Half the songs,” he explained, “I usually play on 
the piano.” But the shovel of groans over high-pitched 
creaking might seem too crude for pretty ivories; even 
as the microphone accidentally slipped — a student 
production crew racing to adjust it — Stephens buck-
led lower for some improvised steel slamming, as if 
that kind of thing happened all the time. When his 
crescendos reached their cracking point we began an 
instant voyage into gritty Mississippi — not as easy 
to digest, perhaps, but a helluva lot more fun than 
dreamy shoe-gazing. Some couldn’t hack Stephens’ 
jagged edges, ushering out after a requisite first listen; 
but for those who stayed, the Skip James-inspired slaps 
were a welcome boost.

Dido
■ Safe Trip Home
SONY BMG (UK)

A fter the radio wave of raucous M.I.A. world-beats and bopping Natasha Bedingfield pop-corn, it’s a refreshing to hear a Brit LP as 
moody and spaced out as Dido’s Safe Trip Home. 
Though her trusty brand of cool, crisp vocaliza-
tions — popularized by Eminem’s song “Stan” 
— feigns a smooth transition from her sold-out 
Life For Rent tour, the album introduces a major 
plot twist: a prematurely introspective, cheesy, 
aged (dare I say old?) Dido. While her four-year 
sabbatical might explain her sudden need for 
soulful reflections, it doesn’t excuse the 36-year-
old’s vapid, vaguely adolescent lyrics and trite 
orchestral dramatics.

Safe Trip Home’s first song, “Don’t Believe 
in Love,” dresses to impress with spare, jazzy 
vocals and raindrop-drum tapes, launching into 
a ’70s-pop chorus, greased up with unsuitably 
funky guitar and overworked strings. The single 
fails to encapsulate the album’s attempt at bare-
boned honesty, pushing instead a let’s-redo-old-
ies approach. Ironically, on its evil-twin track 
“Never Want to Say it’s Love,” Dido proclaims: 

“I’ve made it through the restless phase,” refer-
ring to her multiplatinum debut No Angel, UK’s 
second-most-sold record of the 21st century. But 
when restless is replaced by shallow reminiscing, 
a la “I felt the same today/ As I was feeling yester-
day/ It’ll be the same tomorrow,” fans expecting 
an open-road outlook might feel a bit shafted.

“It Comes and It Goes” gets closest to recap-
turing Dido’s old momentum, complete with 
humming guitars, mounting violinplay and soft, 
introspective pauses describing how inspiration 
“breaks [her]/ when it goes.” The space-age, 
Brian-Eno influenced “Grafton Street” is stirred 
by haunting Celtic flutes and Dido’s cracked-
crystal vocals, providing a little of the reflective 
vibe for which her entire LP yearns. 

Maybe after another world tour Dido can let 
go of her wrinkle worries and revisit the airy 
restlessness that once captured legions of dedi-
cated fans.

T-Pain
■ Thr33 Ringz
JIVE

T -Pain is in a predicament that any sane music-industry hustler would envy. How could he possibly rise to the ridiculously 
high bar set by 2007’s Epiphany? While Thr33 
Ringz doesn’t quite par with last year’s gift to 
the world, it’s enough to keep the Grammy 
winner happily buzzing atop R&B’s vocoder 
fixation. 

The hit-or-miss sequel starts at a snail’s 
pace, with tracks like “Long Lap Dance” (think 
“In Love Wit A Stripper,” but a lot crappier) 
and “Keep Going” — which really shouldn’t. 

T-Pain joins fellow chart-toppers Akon 
and King-of-the-South T.I. to deliver “It Ain’t 
Me,” which is probably what the King said to 
officers when they arrested him for attempted 
theft. With a hard-thumping bass backing 
gurgling with synthy sound-alikes, the track 
is pure fire.

Collabs abound on singles “Can’t Believe 
It,” which features a now-ubiquitous Lil 
Wayne, and “Chopped and Skrewed” keeps 
the album rolling on the shrewd, sharp tongue 

of scene-vet Ludacris. Throw in a few golden-
boy drops from Kanye, and T-Pain’s MTV 
cred is successfully secured for the holidays.

From the man who once crammed 
“Church” and “69” onto one disc, T-Pain’s 
new showcase for his charming brand of 
unwitting candor rings loud and clear, as evi-
dent on “Change” — a remake of Babyface’s 
“Change the World” — which manages to 
make the ’90s feel-good song even cornier 
with lines like, “I’d turn every bullet into a 
Hershey’s kiss/ And we could eat away our 
fears.” 

At the end of it all, T-Pain gives us what 
we all expected: a couple of head-scratchers, 
a handful of poppin’ joints and whole lot of 
indulgent laughs. Even if it doesn’t reach his 
sophomore standards, sometimes we don’t 
need an Epiphany — just another reason to 
shake our ass like it was the first time.

‘PJ’ SCRIPT CHOKED BY CHILDISH CHARM
knows to be right, Farmiga’s performance is cuttingly realistic and ultimately one of the film’s 
finest hallmarks.

While the “Pan’s Labyrinth” vein of childish understanding is the guiding strength here, it’s 
also the principal undoing. In covering a historical issue so frequently revisited in film and lit-
erature, successful explorations necessitate a new perspective. And although the obscuring (or 
purifying) veil of childhood seems ideal, a somewhat “Forrest Gump” approach of simplistic, 
unsophisticated dialogue can’t help but swamp any hope for complex realism — “Pajamas” gives 
childhood a kitschy naivete spelled out in strictly subject-verb-object sentences. Though it’s 
lovely to imagine the Holocaust from an untainted point of view, it’s insulting to youth to suggest 
it as a disability preventing any critical engagement in one’s surroundings. 

In this way, it’s the script that pulls down the set, a flurry of misguided adult efforts at 
screenwriting as if they were children, and ultimately failing to imagine that experience as 
anything more than the fantasia of a “Bambi”-eyed dreamer. Admiration of the film’s aesthetic 
beauty is helplessly coupled with frustration with unrealistic dialogue, childishly diluting a 
complex plot and shearing off a key subtlety begged of any Holocaust invocation.

Edgar Allen Floe
■ The Streetwise LP
MCEO RECORDS

U nless he’s back-pocketing some quill-affirmed cre-ative license, Edgar Allen Floe better hope his creepy-crow namesake is nailed down solid beneath those 
19th-century floorboards. The North Carolina native and 
Justus League underdog aims high on antique romance in 
christening himself the second coming, ’hood style; but 
after we’re done snickering, the old-dead-poet shout-out 
— which I’d bet good money was the brainchild of a ’storm 
process not unlike the naming of a bad porno — Floe’s got 
some serious prosey groundbreaking to live up to.

For all the flak hip-hop’s top dollars take for ripping 
page after page from the tried-and-true bling-bible of hoes 
and auto-flows, there’s just as many (if not more) broken-
record raps circulating in the chest-puffing “elevated” 
underground. Justus crewmates Little Brother have often 
managed to break out of that genre niche — you know, 
workin’ hard, hardly workin’, they’s some wack-black 
rappers, politics is serious shit, I’m true to myself, I’m dig-
gin’ you girl, oh did I mention I was diggin’ myself — on 
sunshine alone, dripped in the sweet chocolate of their 
own raps but mostly carried by soul-sampler and general 
good-timer 9th Wonder, their producer and third leg.

Floe likewise thrives on those rays of symphony (and 
unlike most Wonder charity projects, does clock some 
major studio hours with the most popular beatman there 
be), but the time ain’t nigh and we’re numbed to the for-
mula. Not too much has changed since snappy debut True 
Links, but that was way back in ’05 when we was just some 
young, poetic rascals still hoppin’ to every last literary device 
— darker times call for deeper dives down the kitchen sink. 
September’s mixtape lead-up The Road to Streetwise at least 
rolled a little snowball of creative grime, but Streetwise LP 
could be any intellectual bandwagoner stoked on the utter 
highness of his wacky word associations (see: Gang Starr 
tagalong Juru the Demaja, a far flyer version of the Floe). 
“Make yourself useful/ Get your weight up as my pupil/ A 
sidekick to the official fly shit/ You better try this, this is my 
do-or-die hit,” he schmoozes blandly to the exhausting horn 
loop of “The Hit,” self-produced by alias Slicemysta (guess 
the ’storm sesh let out early). Listen, just there — could that 
be the beat of a tell-tale heart?

Tobacco
■ Fucked Up Friends
ANTICON

G ooey drug nostalgia has always been Tobacco’s m.o. — most noticeably in floaty pop five-piece Black Moth Super Rainbow, his main gig. Fucked 
Up Friends is a familiar trip, relying heavily on pitch-
shifting vocoder tricks, Rhodes piano licks and old-
fashioned breakbeats. Save for a hip-hop bent to the 
instrumentals and a special appearance by the bookish 
freak-emcee Aesop Rock on “Dirt,” Tobacco’s solo out-
put is indistinguishable from the Boards of Canada/Daft 
Punk hybrid that humanized electronica in last year’s 
Dandelion Gum. 

But the thought of layering golden rhymes over the 
lazy-baked techno gems is something Tobacco should 
pursue wholeheartedly for a sophomore LP, since “Dirt” 
solves a minor fault that accompanies his drippy experi-
ments — they all just start to blend together into one 
hallucinogenic mush.  

Like so: bursting synth, kick/snare drum and back-
ground bass riffs repeat for a few measures like a 
GarageBand preset with analog gusto. Then an entranc-
ing vocal fades in and out with koan-like lyrics about 
melting away forever, holding hands and other acid 
epiphanies. 

It works especially well on cuts like “Side 8,” which 
lobs red-lining harpsisynth and evergreen rap beats for 
max versatility. Lots of Fucked Up Friends could hold 
up in a club or on a windows-down cruise, while still 
maintaining a weirdo veneer and sating serious electro-
connoisseurs. Like comfort food, Tobacco fulfills base 
musical cravings, but after a few helpings you won’t 
need a fix for some time.

HOT OR NOT? MAXIM GEEK’S STRUT 
MIGHT BE KEY TO GAMER RECOGNITION  
community like ours would be rocked by such an attrac-
tive woman in the industry is hardly surprising. Yet 
despite her natural beauty, Raymond carried a genuine 
charisma that was instantly charming and personal, simi-
lar to CliffyB. In the thick of Assassin’s Creed’s marketing, 
she received a ton of attention from both the enthusiast 
and mainstream press. Not only was she asked to be on 
various cable and international programs, she was even 
asked to do a spread for Maxim. 

Undoubtedly, much of the attention showered onto 
Raymond eventually trickled down to the game she was 
developing.  Ultimately, when Assassin’s Creed was finally 
released, it ended up being immensely successful, boast-
ing the best first-month sales for any new, original prop-
erty and being the ninth best-selling game of 2007.  

When considering the game’s art direction, setting and 
tone, it’s hard to believe that the content alone could’ve 
inspired such success. As much as I adore Prince of 
Persia, I still find it unbelievable that Ubisoft’s previous 
acclaim could summon the hype needed for Assassin’s 
Creed’s enormous sales and attention. How could the 

spiritual successor to a moderately profitable game fare 
better upon its debut than Gears of War — a title that 
not only plays better, but also recognizes and satiates the 
abundance of testosterone that’s so indicative of this cul-
ture? It wouldn’t have been possible without Raymond’s 
affiliation.  

It may seem obvious that a limelight developer would 
want a considerable say in their game’s future — if any 
creator is worth mentioning, then surely their creation 
should be worthwhile, too. Once we consider how little 
respect the gaming industry receives, and the possibil-
ity that one person has to determine an upcoming title’s 
reception both communally and publically, it’s hard not 
to be excited. Time magazine ever recognizes Shigeru 
Miyamoto as one of the most influential people in the 
world today. 

If more individual developers become physically 
prominent within our industry, will there be a time when 
adequate respect is shown to developers and their games 
alike? The day gamers see a gaming section under the 
Arts & Culture section of the New Yorker will be the day 
we rule the world. Hell yes.

ON DECK Tritons Take Down Conference Foes
By Janani Sridharan
Sports Editor

MEN’S WATER POLO — The No. 
8 Tritons had encouraging perfor-
mances in their last three regular-sea-
son games before the Western Water 
Polo Association Championships. 
UCSD took care of business against 
two conference rivals on the road, 
overcoming a sluggish start against 
No. 11 UC Davis to post a 9-6 vic-
tory on Nov. 7 before turning around 
quickly with a 13-9 win over No. 15 
Santa Clara University on Nov. 8. In 
their final game of the regular sea-
son, the Tritons put up a strong effort 
against powerhouse No. 3 UCLA but 
came up short, falling to the Bruins 
11-8 on Nov. 9 in Los Angeles.

In their previous matchup with 
the Bruins this season, the Tritons 
held the lead before falling 12-9 
on Oct. 11. The second matchup 
between the two teams looked to be a 
UCLA blowout as the Bruins jumped 
out to a 4-1 lead in the first half 
before senior driver Jeff Hunt netted 
a score to cut the UCLA lead to a 
manageable two goals at the half.

The Tritons kept pace with the 
Bruins in the third quarter with 
each team scoring three times in the 
period. The fourth quarter proved 
to be UCSD’s undoing as UCLA 
came out firing with three unan-
swered goals, putting the Tritons in 
a 10-5 hole. The Tritons added three 
goals of their own in the period but 
were unable to dig themselves out. 
Despite the loss, the Tritons spread 
the ball well on offense with seven 
players scoring — an encouraging 
sight for a team about to compete in 
the postseason. 

“It says that a lot of people are 
stepping up and with the postseason 
coming up, you can’t have just a few 
people scoring,” junior two-meter 

defender Peter Gresham said.
UCSD faced off against con-

ference opponent Santa Clara 
University for the first time this 
season in the Broncos’ new aquatic 
facility. The Tritons used a big game 
from junior two-meter Daniel Garcia 
to top Santa Clara 13-9. Garcia, who 
was named WWPA Player of the 
Week, led the Tritons with a whop-
ping six goals.

“Daniel Garcia is a scoring 
machine,” Gresham said. “If you give 
him the ball and he has a second, 
he’ll put it in the back of the cage.”

Senior driver Adnan Jerkovic 
also had a big game as his three 
assists gave him the program record 
for single-season assists. 

“My role on the team is pretty 

well defined,” Jerkovic said. “You can 
think of me as like the point guard 
in basketball terms — a lot of plays 
go through me and I’m fortunate 
enough to be playing with great 
scorers.”

Starting off the weekend, UCSD 
traveled up to Davis to face the 
Aggies in their second matchup this 
year. The Triton offense had nothing 
going on in the early minutes, and it 
was unable to score the entire first 
period. UCSD came back in the sec-
ond quarter to tie the score at three 
by halftime.

“The slow start was due in part 
to us not executing on offense but 
it was mainly due to Davis playing 
good defense in front of their home 
crowd,” Jerkovic said.

With 5:54 left in the third period, 
UC Davis regained the lead but, from 
then on it was all Tritons. Senior 
utility A.J. Kotanjian and Jerkovic 
each scored in the period, and the 
Tritons added four more in the final 
quarter to top the Aggies. 

The two conference wins were 
crucial for the Tritons with the 
WWPA Championships coming up 
Nov. 21 through Nov. 23. 

“We took care of business setting 
up the best possible situation with 
the two wins,” Jerkovic said.

The Tritons will face Sunset San 
Diego in an exhibition game on Nov. 
15 at 12 p.m. at Canyonview Pool.

THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPORTS  15

that has been thrown at him in stride. 
Running back LaDainian Tomlinson 
has been nowhere near his usual self 
this year — the turf toe injury simply 
makes him less explosive — and the 
offensive line has essentially been 
an assorted group of misfits, but 
it has done little 
to slow down the 
passing game. All 
year long, Rivers 
has been the lead-
er of the offense, a 
post that was pre-
viously held by LT, 
and is the biggest 
reason San Diego 
is still in this thing 
with seven weeks 
to go.

Despite a medi-
ocre 4-5 record 
and no semblance 
of effectiveness 
from their defense, the Chargers still 
have all of their goals in sight. San 
Diego may stare up at the Broncos in 
the standings, but the AFC West title 
could be on the line when they face 
each other at Qualcomm Stadium in 
a season-ending showdown on Dec. 

28. Denver has regressed severely 
from a strong start, mostly because 
of a defense that has become worse 
than San Diego’s, and is ripe for a 
potential meltdown in the stretch 
run. 

The Chargers don’t need to look 
far for motivation. At this point last 

year, the Chargers 
were in a similarly 
frustrating position 
at 5-5, but man-
aged to find their 
groove in time to 
carry an eight-
game winning 
streak to the AFC 
C h a m p i o n s h i p 
Game. Matching 
that feat will be 
much more dif-
ficult, especially 
without Merriman 
and upcoming 
games against the 

Steelers, Colts and Falcons. With little 
margin for error, there is no more 
time for the Chargers to sleepwalk 
and go through the motions dur-
ing their games. An inspiring per-
formance is the only thing that will 
suffice on Sunday in Pittsburgh.

Six freshman will be joining the 
seven seniors on this year’s squad, 
looking not only to step into a void 
that will be left next season by an even 
larger graduating class, but to grasp the 
system quickly this year and contribute 
immediately. Carlson is looking for 
players who understand his coaching 
philosophy and exhibit their determi-
nation in practice.

“Our focus as a program is always 
on defense and rebounding,” Carlson 
said. “I think that’s where champi-
onships are won. I think that’s what 
we tried to do last year, in terms of 
guarding people, getting stops when 
we needed and trying to block out and 
rebound.” 

Regarding his starting five this sea-
son, Carlson said it is too early to dis-
cuss the player rotation.

“The guys who play the best and 
give their best at practice are the guys 
who are going to play,” he said.

The first step for the Tritons this 
season will be their annual meeting 
with Division-I opponent San Diego 
State. Last season, UCSD gave a 
glimpse of its future success by push-
ing the Aztecs throughout the game. 
The Tritons held a lead deep into the 
first half and were able to cut the SDSU 
advantage to single digits before falling 
by a 76-60 final score. Carlson said the 
test provided by SDSU is valuable for 
the Tritons.

“I think it’s always a great game 
for the university, our program and 
the basketball community as a whole 
in San Diego,” Carlson said. “I think 
without question San Diego State will 
always be one of the better teams we 
play throughout the season. It’s a really 
good gage for us. They’re very long, 
very athletic, very well-coached and I 
think in many respects they’re similar 
to a lot of other teams we’ll play during 
the season in terms of athleticism.”

Following its meeting with the 
Aztecs, UCSD will face University of 
the Pacific, another Division-I oppo-
nent, followed by nonconference 
matchups with Notre Dame de Namur 
and Central Washington. The Tritons 
will then begin their conference sched-
ule and the defense of their CCAA 
crown at home against Humboldt 
State. Picked in the preseason coaches’ 

poll to finish, the Tritons will again be 
looking to surprise the league.

“Obviously, winning the CCAA is 
one of our first goals, especially since 
winning our conference ensures that 
we will be given a high seed in region-
als,” Kim said. “From there, trying to 
go as deep into the playoffs as we can. 
I know that both of these things are 
attainable because we have the person-
nel and commitment to do it.”

Carlson agrees that despite person-
nel changes, this year’s squad is still 
focused on returning to postseason 
competition, while also serving as a 

strong reflection of the campus.
“We want to be one of the better 

teams in the CCAA and we want to 
try and put ourselves in a situation 
where we can be a postseason per-
former,” Carlson said. “We want to just 
be a good representative of UCSD. It’s a 
first-rate university, and we want to be 
a first-rate basketball program.”

The team’s first test comes this 
Saturday at Cox Arena against SDSU. 
Tip-off is scheduled for 1 p.m.

SWIMMING & DIVING — The 
men’s and women’s swim teams 
started off this past weekend with a 
boom and finished just as strongly. 
Competing in a triple meet against 
Division-I schools UC Davis and Cal 
State Bakersfield at home on Nov. 9, 
the Tritons held their own and made 
quite a splash against two big-name 
programs. The Lady Tritons set the 
tone with a win in the 400-yard med-
ley relay race while the Triton men 
left an impression on their opponents 
with a first-place finish in the 200-
yard freestyle relay.

The women’s medley relay team, 
comprised of sophomore Anju 
Shimura, junior Karla Holman, senior 
Kendall Bohn and senior captain 
Shannon Simonds, finished first with 
a time of 3:56.81. 

“We just swam out of our minds,” 
Simonds said after the race. 

At the close of the day, the women’s 
200-yard freestyle relay team almost 
took both relays, finishing a mere 13 
milliseconds behind the Aggies. The 
race began with freshman Shea Kopp, 
followed by senior captain Aubrey 
Panis, Simonds and anchored by 
senior Erinn Deters, finishing with 
a cumulative time of 1:37.54. This 
race drew a huge crowd and was only 
eclipsed by the size of the crowd hov-
ering over the men’s race that followed 
it. The Triton men closed the day with 
a strong win in the 200-yard freestyle 
relay, led by freshman Sam Stromberg, 
junior captain Dan Perdew, fresh-
man Blake Langland and anchored 
by junior Todd Langland. The team 
finished with a cumulative time of 
1:25.62 to win the event.

With this being only the second 
meet of the season for UCSD, Perdew 
is already happy with the swimmers’ 
progress.

 “The team showed improvement 
from last meet’s win over Claremont-
Mudd-Scripps, but still had room for 

improvement,” Perdew said.
Not knowing what to expect from 

two Division-I schools so early in 
the year, the Triton teams only knew 
that they would be pushed by the 
competition. The Aggies came out 
on top, with the men’s team posting 
a 149-92 victory over the Triton men 
and the Aggie women winning over 
the Lady Tritons 135-107. The Tritons 
placed second with a 145-95 win over 
Cal State Bakersfield on the men’s 
side and a decisive 185-56 win on the 
women’s side.

Even though the Tritons were 
unable to overcome the Aggies, head 
coach Scott McGihon said he was 
happy with his team’s performance in 
the Tritons’ second competition.

“We swam real well and showed 
our depth,” he said. “We won all but 

one relay and had a good showing 
today.”

The Tritons had some outstand-
ing individual performances at the 
meet, with special accolades going to 
freshman Alexandra Henley, senior 
captain Steven Hardy and Perdew. 
Henley swam on the third-place 200-
yard freestyle relay team, took sec-
ond in the 200-yard backstroke and 
placed second in the 400-yard indi-
vidual medley. Hardy finished second 
in the 200-yard backstroke and also 
swam the backstroke leg of the 400-
yard medley relay team, which took 
fifth place.

“I had better times than ever 
before,” Hardy said. “This is good 
competition to get us prepared for the 
level of our conference meets.” 

Perdew also had a strong showing, 

taking first place in the 50-yard free-
style with a time of 21.27 seconds, and 
also was the second leg of the first-
place 200-yard freestyle relay team, 
which finished with a time of 1:25.62. 

“All I think about is beating the 
people next to me,” Perdew said.

As a team, the Tritons can feel 
good about how they performed 
against their opponents, especially 
swimming powerhouse UC Davis.

“We had some really good swims 
and we swam well as a team,” Panis 
said.

With this meet under their belts, 
the Tritons will race on Nov. 14 at UC 
Santa Barbara and then focus on pre-
paring for the Nike Cup in February.

MEN’S BASKETBALL — Last season, 
the Tritons set program records twice 
for consecutive wins at the Division-II 
level, recorded their first victory against 
a Division-I opponent and found them-
selves in a first-place tie in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association late in 
the season. Unfortunately, the team lost 
its final five regular season home games 
and seemed to have no momentum 
heading into the CCAA Tournament. 
However, despite their low seeding, the 
Tritons rebounded, rolling off three 
straight wins to capture their first-ever 
CCAA Championship and advance to 
the NCAA Tournament for the first 
time at the Division-II level.

Head coach Chris Carlson, who 
came from UCLA and helped guide the 
team to unprecedented success in his 
first season as a head coach, will now 
look to build on last year’s accomplish-
ments. Obviously, losing five seniors 
from the 2007-08 team, including for-
mer all-CCAA honorees forward Henry 
Patterson, guard Clint Allard and for-
mer CCAA Freshman of the Year guard 
Andrew Hatch will change the Triton 
squad’s makeup. Despite the departures, 
Carlson seems hopeful about the out-
look for this year’s team.

“Every team has its own identity, and 
we’re trying to carve that out right now,” 
Carlson said. “I feel very strong about 
this year’s team. I like how far we’ve 
progressed, how hard we’ve worked in 
practice and we’re going to continue to 
do that. We need guys, our senior group 
in particular, to really step up. I have 
high expectations for that group and for 

our team as a whole.”
This year’s squad will definitely have 

experience on its side as it is the most 
senior-laden group in recent UCSD 
history. Seven players will be entering 
their final season in a UCSD uniform, 
including four-year letterwinners guard 
Shane Poppen, forward Darryl Lawlor 
and center A.J. Maulhardt as well as 
point guard Kelvin Kim, one of only 
two players to start every game last sea-
son. Kim, another UCLA transfer, has 
embraced his own role as a leader and 
teacher for the Triton newcomers.

“I feel like I have a lot more respon-
sibility this year,” Kim said. “We have 
a lot of freshmen on the team, so I’m 
trying to do my best in teaching them 
the ropes and making the adjustment 
as smooth as possible for them. I know 
that the faster they come along, the bet-
ter that we will be this year and for the 
years to come.”

Kim also said that his first year in 
Triton blue and gold left him better 
prepared for his final collegiate basket-
ball season and the year under coach 
Carlson has helped the team grow clos-
er and more perceptive of one another.

“We have a lot of experienced play-
ers on our team, especially the returning 
guys from last year’s team,” he said. “I 
know that we are a lot hungrier to go 
deeper into the playoffs this season 
after getting a taste of it last season. 
Just being one year older as a group has 
helped with our chemistry on the court. 
I know that I have a better idea of the 
instincts of my teammates and I’m sure 
that they have a good understanding of 
mine as well.”

Tritons Hold Their Own Against D-I Rivals

STRUGGLING 
CHARGERS 

ON LIFE 
SUPPORT

With their season hanging in the balance, the San Diego Chargers were able 
to avoid a bitter case of deja vu, 
turning away the Kansas City Chiefs’ 
two-point conversion attempt in the 
final minute to seal Sunday’s 20-19 
victory over their rival in the under-
achieving AFC West. The thrilling 
win helped head coach Norv Turner 
exact revenge on the only team that 
beat him at Qualcomm Stadium a 
year ago, but the performance was 
far from encouraging. The Chargers 
struggled to find their form, almost 
letting a team that is 1-17 in its last 
18 games beat them on their home 
field for the second straight year. 
The victory helped San Diego keep 
pace with division-leading Denver, 
but provided no reason to believe the 
Chargers are beginning to approach 
the Super Bowl caliber form that was 
expected during the preseason.

San Diego’s fundamental prob-
lem presented itself early in the NFL 

season when it became apparent 
that linebacker Shawne Merriman 
just wasn’t the same player with 
his damaged knee ligaments. After 
doing his best to play during the 
season opener against the Carolina 
Panthers, Merriman was immedi-
ately placed on injured reserve and 
ruled out for the season. His absence 
from the Chargers defense has taken 
nearly all the bite out of a unit that 
forced a league-leading 47 turnovers 
last year. It was a unit that while 
consistently surrendering yards in 
bunches, could always be counted 
on for a game-changing play. Just 
ask Super Bowl XLI MVP Peyton 
Manning, who threw eight inter-
ceptions in two games against San 
Diego last year. Merriman’s presence 
as a dominant speed rusher in San 
Diego’s 3-4 defense allowed him to 
get to the quarterback repeatedly, 
which in turn created big plays for 
the defense. In many ways, San Diego 
became too reliant on forcing turn-
overs and didn’t focus on becoming 
a stifling unit that could shut teams 
down. Now without Merriman, the 
Chargers have forced only 10 turn-
overs for the year and are 26th in 
total yards allowed. The ferocious 
pass rush from last year is nonexis-
tent and allows opposing quarter-
backs to pick apart the Chargers at 
will. It has gotten so bad that defen-
sive coordinator Ted Cottrell has 
been fired. This has simply put too 
much pressure on the offense, which 
is actually playing very well.

The offense is holding its own 
mainly because Phillip Rivers has 
developed into one of the league’s 
elite quarterbacks. It may be hard to 
believe but Rivers leads the NFL in 
touchdown passes (21), is second in 
quarterback rating (106.3) and owns 
a 31-13 career record as a starter. 
Rivers has endured a ton of criti-
cism and will never be able to escape 
Eli Manning’s enormous shadow, but 
the fifth-year quarterback has carried 
himself tremendously. The 27-year-
old pro is still rough around the edges 
and is prone to forcing the action at 
times, but he has handled everything
