Montalvo Scolded On Search Issue 
Saxon Says AS Can't Remove Dunnett Over Openness on Chancellor Candidates 

BY JEFF BERESFORD. HOWE N_. Editor I'm going to do," Dunnett said.) Montalvo for some things that weren't really his fault. 
Conflict between students and administration over 

the chancellor's search process erupted yesterday 
when UC President David Saxon allegedly yelled at 
AS President Carlos Montalvo and called him a 
"liar." 

Montalvo had called Saxon to ask him about a 
letter sent yesterday by the undergraduate search 
committee dropping the issue of campus visitations 
but raising the possibility of a meeting with the two 
remaining candidates and students in Los Angeles 
this Sunday. 

"Carlos got blamed for a lot of thinss that were 
reallr. done by the AS Council. They thouBht they 
didn t have enough information about the names, 
and I thought they should have more information, 
too, but it wasn't my responsibility to give it to them," 
she said. 

Saxon declined comment on the conversation, but 
Montalyo was furious after talking with the UC 
president on the phone for 45 minutes. 

"It was an exercise in futility," he said ... He yelled at 
me, called me names and said I was a liar." 

The letter tells Saxon the meeting would be an 
important "symbolic gesture" and would bring 
"vital" student participation into the hunt for a 
chancellor. 

When the council tried to pressure Saxon into 
involving students, Montalvo was blamed by Saxort, 
she believes. 

Montalvo, however, was haraher in his 
explanation of Saxon's behavior. 

"He told me that he didn't ever want to hear me 
saying that I was going to remove (AS Search 
Committee representative) Cheryl Dunnett from the 
committee. 'It was my decision to appoint her, not 
yours,' he told me." 

"He just started talking and wouldn't let me get a 
word in edgewise. He uked me who I represented 
and why I was doing this to his committee. And he . 
told me to off Cheryl's back," Montalvo said. 

"A lot of problems on this campus were a direct 
result of a lack of consultation. The whole Academic 
Senate/McFJroy thing didn't happen because they 
didn't like the decision; they didn't like the way it was 
made. 

The AS Council approved last week a resolution 
asking Dunnett to leave the committee if campus 
visitations are not allowed, and Saxon has told the 
committee there will be no such visits. 

"A UCSD official meeting with Saxon at the 
regular chancellor's conference in Berkeley told 
Montalvo that Saxon regrets his conduct and told the 
chancellors he would send a letter of apology today. 

"Now Saxon is going to bring a chancellor down 
here under exactly the same conditions ... 

"He has no concept of what our concerns are. 

("I am the student representative, and I will think 
about leaving if they ask, but I don't know yet what 

Saxon said last night only that a letter "to respond Most of the decisions made in Berkeley are made in 
to his concerns" about the process was planned. an administrative vacuum, with no input from 

Dunnett believes the president was blaming anyone," Montalvo said.

Surfers Ignore Warnings 
Of Contamination at Beach 

BY JENIFER WARREN 
Staff Writer 

Although the beach quarantine has 
been tiftecl at Black's Beach, the San 
Diego County Lifeguard Service 
warned yesterday that "evidence of 
fecal coloform, causing diarrhea and 
p-esenting the riale of hepatiti.," is .ti11 
being found along IUJ1'OUOCIing coastal 
areas. 

According to Andrew O'leary, 
Lifeguard Service .poke.man, 
"Torrey Pines Latoon and 500 feet of 
shoreline north and south of there is .till 
contaminated. The Sunset Ciffs area 
up to north of Pacific Beach is also still 
under quarantine, until further notice 
from the county office," He added. 

Yet despite the danger of hepatitis 
and other bacterial infections, and 
despite warnings by the media and 
notices poeted by the I...ifetuard Service 
indicating polluted areu, .urfers 
c:ontnae to enter the water. 

"I heard a warnm, on the radio lut 
week, but when I saw other auya out 
there and .. w the water was dear, I 
said what the hell and went on out," 
one four.year surf veteran said. 

Molt aurfw. contacted qreed that 
aurfint is "really import ... i' in their 

lives, and that "one little warning about 
contaminated water wasn't important 
enough" to keep them off their boards. 

"I thought the warninss about 
polluted water were probably people 
just overreacting to this whole thing, so 
I surfed anyway," .aid one local ocean· 
goer. 

Many surfers concurred, however, 
that once the actual threat of hepatitis 
was made public and once they leamed 
how serious the disease could be, they 
became worried. 

"I surfed in polluted water at 
Oceanside Harbor two years ago and 
didn't get sick, but this time I think I'll 
get a vaccination (from UC5D's 
inununization clinic) just in case," 
reflected one surfer from this school. 

But even if he does, he should still 
wait before surfing. 

A representative from the UCSD 
immunization clinic, which is offering 
~uslobulin vaccinationa against 
hepatitis for a four dollar charge, 
warned yesterday that "there's no 
yu.antee the vaccination win prevent 
contraction of the disease. It may help,

Saxon Says Tuition Only 
CODling if Jarvis II Passes. 

BY CAROLYN FRIDAY 
Sacramento Corre."ondent 

UC President David Saxon said 
today that his statement to the Senate 
Finance Subcommittee that any 
subttantial cuts in' the governor's 
1980·81 budget would probably 
neceuitate imposing tuitions "was an 
inadvertance.' 

Although Saxon's original comment 
was in direct reference to the 
governor's budget, and seemingly 
unrelated to Jarvis II, Saxon said when 
he talks about tuition, it is only in 
reference to the probable 
consequences of the tax· cutting 
iriitiative. 

''The ordinary give-and.take of the 
budget proceu through the lefalature 
is not going to lead to tuition, , Saxon 
assured Lowell Paige, his special 
uliatant in Sacramento. 

UC Vice· President Tom .Jenkins, 

however, was clearly not thinking in 
terms of Jarvis II, when he said the 
administration considers "any cuts are 
subttantial" and hence, justification for 
impo-,ing tuition. 

When asked if a one percent 
reduction constituted "substantial 
cuts," Jenkins cited the usual university 
rhetoric that UC has already suffered a

Jews Seek Dialogue With Leftists 
Editor: 

We would like 10 thank you for your coverage 
of the rally for peKe (Duilll Guardian, Feb. 25) 
...... by students at the showing of The 
Par..dnlGn. However, ttuee main points are in 
need of dMficalion: 

life to the ,Jewish people. Is it inflammatory to 
remember those people or to seelt a peaceful 
IOlution to the Paleatinian iuue? Please 
understand that we are sympathetic to the plight 
ol the Palestinians. We are, however, decidedly 
against the terrorist PLO. 

1) W. w .. not picketintl "in protest of" the 
film. W. w .. not taPtI that the fmt should not 
have been Ihown. We l(IadIy accept that the 
Committee for World Democracy has 81 much 
rilht to preHnt their opiniona .s we do our own. 
We were, instead, rallying for peace and a 
peaceful IOlution to the Palettinian iuue at a 
movie that we feel encourages terroriam and 
racist attitudea. 

3) As of now, there has been little 
communication between Jewish and leftist 
groups on campus. To place the blame on us for 
not contacting leftist groups is unfair, seeing as 
we were never told in advance about certain 
projecta which we would have wanted to co-
sponsor. 

It is certainly a two-way street. The UJS & 
lAC have been working hard on projectJ IUch as: 

2) It waa stated that our poster for the rally had 
an "inftammatory tone" and that it may have 
incited the throwing of the rock through our office 
wWIow. We don't feel that statements such as 
"to stage a eful raly" and "please take time 
to rememC:C and rally for peace" are 
........... ~atall. 

Nestle's boycott, helping the boat people, and 
programs about oppressed Jews in Russia, Syria 
and Ethiopia. We were never contacted about 
help on these programa; stiD, we believe that this 
problem of lack of communication can be solved. 

We don t feel that it's intIammato,", to 
dedicate a Sabbath to "those Who have died at 
the hand of PLO terrorism." The PLO has a 
deaire to etro Israel (Article 15, PLO 
cov.,....t) terrorist acta (Article 10).

Opt Outs Need Help 
. Toward Adulthood 

Mary Ellen Leary, who writes regularly for The 
Economist in London, wrote this story (or Pacific News 
Service. 

BY MARY ElLEN LEARY 
Every day, Angel Flores walks down 116th Street to 

Benjamin Frauk1in -·· 'igh School in East Harlem. But he isn't 
enrolled there anymore. He spends his time on a nearby 
comer with several friends. They listen to their tape cassette 
players, smoke doJ>t! and admire passing cars. 

Like up to half of New York's youth, they don't go to school 
and they don't work. They are part of America's army of 
unemployed young people - nine million strong and growing 
every year. 

But the soaring drop-out and unemployment rates among 
those between 16 and 21 years old are symptoms of a much 

12 percent of all white young p'eople 
and 36 percent of black youth's are 
employed and out of school 
larger problem that has serious implications for the future of 
the nation. "1bey are not just out of school and out of the 
labor force," concluded a recent high.level report on the crisis. 
"They are out of society." 

The report, by the influential Carnegie Council on Policy 
Studies in Higher Education, charged that American 
institutions, and the educational system in particular, provide 
young people with virtuaUy no practical support during the 
difficult transition from adolescence to adulthood. 

As a result, young Americans must flounder in the ~mbo of 
career uncertainty and indecision before finding a satisfactory 
niche in society. Many of them will never find one at all. 

The Carnegie council has produced several landmark 
analyses of -college-level educational policy, but in "Giving 
Youth a Better Chance," prepared by UC .labor economist 
Margaret Gordon, it confronts the problems of a younger 
population, as well as a broader social challenge. The drop-
out, or as Gordon puts it, "the opt-out youth," was pinpoirited 
in the report as a special social tragedy, affecting too large a 
segment of the coming generation to be lightly dismissed. 
Currently, 12 percent of all white young people - and 36 
percent of black youths - from 16lo 21 are unemployed and 
out of school. 

But even for those who have not dropped out, the Iystem 
a~ars to be failing. Recommending sweeping cha"lcs in 
US high school curricula, council director and former UC 
president Clark Kerr called secondary schools "the most 
neglected segment of American education." 

Although legislation in the 1960s and 1970s channeled 
million. of federal doDars into early elementary school 
improvementa. and into programs for minority youth in the 
nation's coUeges, relatively little went into the high schools. In 
1979, federal expenditures for the disadvantaged in college 
averaged $1,9lO per student; the figure for high school 
students was only $278. And much less than that was spent 
on high-school-aged drop-outs. 

Yet these are precisely the years when young people face 
their most difficult choices, and when many of them will make 
decision. that have a ~fe-Iong impact. 

The report cited a critical lapse in programs geared to 
iitbcidui.-J students to the challenges of the real world which 
they milst soon enter. The final two years of secondary 
school, according to the council, should allow students the . 
freedom to experiment with adult responsibilities: to acquin; 
both legitimate work experience and the beginning of some 
form of personal service commitment to their communi.". 

Instead, the junior imd senior years now offer little more 
than an extension of earlier school experiences, with . no_ 
special recognition of the student's impending need to aSIUlne 
a more mature social role. . 

The present high school vocatio~1 training system fails 
miserably at that task, accordinllto the Carnegie council. 
Classes are out of touch with modern labor needs and almost 

. useless at moving youth into the job market. A 'h\dy of 
vocational training issued by the National Institdte of 

Educa~on suggests that the main effect of such instrjJctian 
may simply be to preserve an alternative track in tht high • 
schools for students who are not college-bound. The goal ian"t 
sound preparation for a livelihood; it is keeping-kids in ICbool 
and off the streets. 

"School-based vocational training generally fails either to 
convince youth to stay in school or improve their labormerkttt 
success," charged Bruce Fuller, an expert on educatio.'& a..d~­
employment policy at Stanford. "If a school had a vocational 
teacher who knew only how to fix Edsels, tenure would 
require continuing his dassea regardless of the limited job 

mark~I." 
TIle absence of effective training programs hits hardest 

where the employm~nt proapects are worst: among minority 
"youth in the nation's bis citiel. Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, acting 
regional commiuioner for the Bureal,l of Labor Statistics, has . 
warned of a "serious mismatch" between current vocational 
instruction for blacks and Hispanics in New York and that 
city's labor demanda. He pnadic:ted that the miamatch would .

Anderson .Scores Two; 
Demos Split Primari~s 

BOSTON - Rep. John 
Anderson surged from the 
Republican field to score a 
startling upset over Ronald 
Reagan last night in 
Vermont's presidential 
primary. He also led in 
Massachussetts, where Sen. 
Edward Kennedy won his own 
Democratic primary. Presi. 

- dent Carter swamped 
Kennedy in Vermont. 

Even as Carter conceded 
his first defeat to Kennedy, his 
spokesman said Massachus-
sets wasn't a real test because 
it was the senator's home 
state. 

Anderson's surprise 
showing validated his claim 
that the Republican race has 
not narrowed to a two-
candidate affair between 
Reagan and George Bush. 

The silver-haired liberal 
celebrated with his supporters 

- in Boston, telling them that it 
was obvious he would make "a 
tremondously strong showing" 
in Massachusetts , where 
partial returns gave him 31 
percent o( the vote to 30 
percent apiece for Bush and 
Reagan. fn Vermont, it was 

Anderson 32 percent, Reagan 
30 percent, Bush 22 percent. 

Anderson ' s Vermont 
victory left him short of the 40 
percent required to win any 
delegates there; they will be 
chosen later this year at a state 
party convention. 

Anderson's support was 
bouyed by a hefty turnout of 
independent voters in the 
Republican primaries in both 
states. That won't be available 
to him later in closed primaries 
where only registered 
Republicans can vote. 

Kenn~dy held a 2-to-1 
landslide margin over Carter 
in Massachusetts, and that's 
what he needed in the state 
that has four times elected him 
a senator.

Voters Confused 
On Rent Control 

SAN FRANCISCO - The 
majority of Californians 
support the idea of local rent 
control laws, according to a 
California Poll released 
yesterday. 

However that does not 
necessarily mean a majority 
will vote against an anti-rent 
control measure on the June 
ballot, said pollster Mervin 

Field. 
Fifty-eight percent of the 

people polled last month said 
they favor local rent control 
laws, 32 percent were opposed 
and 10 percent undecided. 

But only 48 percent said 
they oppose Propsition 10, 
which was placed on the baDot 
by interests seeking to ban 
statewide rent control and to 
weaken local rent control laws . 
Forty-two percent favored the 
ballot measure and 10 percent 
were undecided.

Minority Favor 

SACRAMENTO - Gov.

treatment for minorities in

In papers filed with the court 
Monday, the Democratic 
governor said attempts to 
increase work and educational 
opportunities for minorities 
were threatened by a state 
appeals court decision that 
preferential a<lmissions 

by Garry Trudeau 

violated the state constitution. 
The university, defending

Sills opened hi. part of the debate by 
citing .tati.tics which he claimed 
dilproved "predictions of disaster" 
made by opponents of Proposition 13. 
Contrary to predictions, Sill. claimed, 
unemployment fell from 7.8 percent 
(July 1978) to 6.0 percent (Dec. 
1979) in San Diego, and government 
spending rose in San Diego and its 
school districta. 

These figures were questioned by 
AS Vice President Nancy Laga, who 
stated that t~ unemploymentstalislics 
were not comparable seasonal figures. 

In addition, Sills noted that, while 
the city and school budgets rose 11 
percent and 24 perc:ent respectively. 
the county budget fell $16 million, or 3 
percent. 

How will those with low and middle 
incomes benefit from Proposition 9? 
" Low and middle income tax services 
will be cut firllt ," Lewis claimed. 

" Forty percent of the money 
Proposition 9 cuts from the budget 
goes to the richest five percent of all 
taxpayers," Lewis stated. 

Lewis claimed ' that his Tax 
Simplicity Act, which he is attempting 
to get onto the November ballot, would 
"close the tax loopholes for the wealthy

and redistribute the weight of the

wealthy." 

Lewis perceive. Proposition 9 as an 
"ideological war" on government that 
hides behind the "myth" that there is a 
di.tinction between private and public 
inve.lrnent. .

education system will suffer if Jarvis II

Everything they've done for 
the last few days, actually for 
the past few months, has been 
planned with this all.important 
meet in mind. Chris Dixon , a 
senior who's finishing out his 
college career this week, is 
going so far as to shave his

will do anything for a tenth of a

Dixon's action is not an

The UCSD baseball team traveled to USD 
an NCAA Division I team a nd the 1977 
Division II champion for the second time this 
season and came away with their second loss , 
10·3. Despite the fina l score, the Tritons played 
good solid baseball . They looked sharp and 
kept their mental mistakes to a minimum. They 
just couldn't come up with that knock out punch 
or that burst of speed in the stretch. 

HWe didn't come up with that big play," 
pointed out Triton coach Vince Askey. "We 
have never developed that winr,ing attitude 
here before. I just hope it doesn' t get the team 
down. I still think this is the most talented team 
UCSD has ever had ." 

The Tritons drew first blood in the third 
inning when Jim Moffatt and Mark Sharpe 
started things off with back to back singles. 
With two outs, leftfielder Matt Wright 
grounded a single into the hole at shortstop.

run. 

The Toreros came back with two runs of 
their own in the bottom of the second on three 
singles and a pair of walk • . 

UCSD pushed their second run acroll in the 
top of the fourth after pit.cher Rick Jaye singled 
to left , reached second on a fielder 's choice and 
was sacrificed to third by Jim Moffall . Triton 
shortstop Mark Sharpe hit a hard grounder to 
USD shortstop Mike Saverino which he 
couldn't come up with, allowing Jaye to tie the 
score. 

But the floodgates opened on Triton pitcher 
Rick Jaye in the bottom of the fourth when he 
was racked for three more runs. Jaye, who hat 
been UCSD's most effeCtive pitcher this season, 
suffered his first defeat but he still didn't have a 
bad outing. 

HI didn't have any velocity today," Jaye said 
after the game. " My fastball just wasn't there."

Students dverwhelmingly oppose a 
change in the drop rate, according to an 
informal survey conducted last Friday in 
front of the Registrar'S Office. During 
two hours, (morning and afternoon), 
108 students indicated adamant 
disapproval of a possible change from 
the sixth week to the fourth week, as is 
now being decided by the Academic 
Senate (UCSD's collective faculty). Nine 
students were undecided, four were in 
favor, while another six would support it 

_ conditionally if midterms were held 
before the fourth week as an indicator of 
class standing. 

It seems that many faculty ,support the 
change (not specifying the above 
condition), .and so college councils and 
the ASUCSD urge you to fill out the 

mail~in below in order to better voice the 
opinion of stud~nts. The change will be 
decided by the Senate very soon, if a 
quorum of 51 faculty is present. 

Your mail in means a lot, so exert your 
influence, already ...

night before the action begin., 
the athletes meet in a 
bathrooom in their hotel. 
Together, they shave off every 
hair on their arm., legs, cheat, 
back - every place not 
covered by their luit or their 
rubber head cap. There 
probably won't be an unshom 
swimmer at the meet 
Thurlday. 

UCSO Coach BiO Morgan 
cites a ltudy that shOWs that' 
jutt the physical lou of hair 
from a male Iwimmer'l body 
can make him up to a half a 
leCond futer in a 100 free 
race, due to Ies. relistance in 
the water. IJ shaving meant 
jUlt that half second, many 
.wimmers migbt wonder if 
their aelf-conaciouanell at the 
beach thil Ipring would be 
worth the drop. 

The real payoff, however, 
cornea in the mind. It produces 
the feeling that "shaving down 
il going to make me smooth 
and fait," as sprinter Joe 
Hernandez saYI. 'The razor 
takes oH the top layer oflkin, 
exyoling nerve endingl. 
When the swimmerl dive in 
the water, they feel a tirmr1e 
over every inch of their body. 

"It'llike no other sensation 
you've ever felt," laYI coach 
Morl{an, whOle shaving daYI 
as a San Diego State lwimmer 
were not that long ago. "The 
feel for the water is real 

important in swimming," he 
said. 

'The travel to diltant placel 
helps too. The anticipation of 
that end of the season trip, the 
delayed lratification for those 
painful houri in the pool every 
morning and afternoon, can 
hype up a swimmer. Monday 
the team Oew to Chicago, then 
traveled to Whitewater, 
Wisconsin via bus and rental 
car. 

Life on the road a110 means 
living in hotels, eating in 
restaurants, and living out of a 

IUitcale. But the confinement 
il definitely a plus for the team 
at a time when excitement is 
contagious. 

"We lpend a lot of time 
together - more than mOlt 
people lpend in a relation· 
Ihip," explain. Morgan. 
"Most of our paychological 
p_r~bleml are ironed out. 
We're jUlt working toward one 
common goal."

the national scene in 1978,

Don't Experiment, But They Can 

BY STEPHANIE DAVIDSON 
"Most of the com temporary 

music jn San Diego is 
performed at the universities, 
and there are possibly a few 
small series being performed 
here .and there," says Mark 
Sansusi, music graduate 
student and an organizer of 
UCSD's Atomicafe perlor. 
rnancea. 

Alomicafe is a sit·down 
concert "situation" where 
graduate music students 
perform finished musical 
compositions. The perfor· 
mances are held at Mandeville 
Recital HaU, generally every 
other Tuesday at 8 pm. And 
they constitute a primary 
source of contemporary music 
for San Diegans. 

He adds that, " ... these 
concerts at UCSD are free and 
if people would not come with 
predetermined expectations, 
attending an Atomicafe 
concert wouldn't hurt. It is not 
to ' insult the audience's 
intelligence because mo t 
everything performed here 
these days is a well defined, 
finiahed piece. 

"Atomicafe," he goes on, 
"is where people come, and 
they experience music. It is a 
sit-down, pay attention kind of 
thing. Lot's of people attend 
the concerts with preconcep· 
tions as to whether or not they 
are going to accept what they 
came to hear. If they came

said, . "People should listen to 
Atomicafe with the same 
attitude they take to an 
abstract art exhibit, just listen 
with a fresh perspective and an 
open mind. Ignore the fact that 
there are intellectual and 
conceptual ideas behind these 
contemporary compositions 
because each and every 
person sees and hears 
something different in all that 
he or she experiences." 

When Music Professor 
Jean·Charles Francoise was 
asked what the purpose of 
Atomicafe was, he replied that 
"Atomicafe is essenti"l for the 
Musician/Composer's educa· 
tional procell to know how to 
organize musical concepts; to 
make music possible. It is 
supposed to be an informal 
forum where one can get 
feedback from friends . It is an 
educational tool, a great place 
to make music and to put 
musical concepts from 
scratch. Profel5or Will Ogden 
organized Atomicafe in 1968 
because he wanted the music 
department more oriented 
toward the creative, 
composer/musician. " 

"Now, Atomicafe is not an 
officially sponsored series. 
The graduate students 
petitioned to have free rein to 
do what they want as far as 
programming, bringing in 
some outside performers and 
holding receptions after some 
of the performances. For this 
we get a small budget from the 
musIc department ," Sansusi 
said.

Since the Atomicafe 
experimental music series was 
started it:' 1968, it has evolved 
and changed. 

"The character of the series 
has changed," said Francoise. 
"It uaed to be like the series I 
was involved in when I lived in 
Paris , called Cafe Theatre. It 
was p-erformed in a cafe with a 
small stage or in a cellar. This 
was where performers would 
mix theatrics and music or 
poetry . Some of the pieces 
involved the public. It was 
very influenced by the Dada 

movement. It was without 
seriousness of a formal concert 
and very anti·concept and 
structure; the setting was 
intimate. 

"Now the graduate student 
may do what they like and 
ha ve returned to traditional 
concepts and the structure of a 
more formal concert situation. 
This has occurred mostly 
because of the pressure of 
academic work in doing 
serious compositions. They 
probably just don't have the 
time for anything else." 

Sansusi believes some of the 
changes occurred when, " ... a 
full· time publicity director was 
hired. He was getting critics to 
come and also people from the 
newspapers. Since then, 
Atomicafe has become this big 
formal thing. That is when it 
started getting oriented more 
toward the finished piece or 
idea." 

O'Grady adds that, 
" ... there is no censorship or 
discrimination, every musician 
who has finished a piece and

'Twelfth Ni ht' An 1m rovement 
New TV Shakespeare Season Begins Well 

BY BETH ACCOMANDO 
Senior Staff Writer 

"If music be the food of 
love, play on." With this 
enchanting line, Shakespeare 
opens ru. delightful comedy, 
Twelhlt Niglu, and PBS opens 
its second season of The 
Shake.peare Plays. 1be first 
season of The Shake.peare 
Plays produced mixed results 
with mOlt episodes flawed by 
complete conventionality and 
by settling for mere recitations 
of the texts. 

This season, the series is off 
to a better start with a 

capti v aling and lyrical 
production of Twelfth Night , 
The series, though, i. still a bit 
stiff and could use more 
innovative directors. 

Shakespeare was never 
very original when it carne to 
plots - he borrowed 
constantly from himself and 
other writers. Twelfth Night 
(probably taken from Barnaby 
Rich's Apolonius and SilIa) 
develops in a manner similar 
to As You Like It . The play 
works through a series of 
disguises, mistaken identities, 
comic improbabilities, and an 

Fan.hen , a compelling social drama about the 
moderruzation of a small Chinese village, will be presented at 
8 pm March 5-8 in the UCSD Theatre on Wa.rren Campus.

odd romantic triangle. 
The t:omic escapades begin 

when Viola and her twin 
brother Sebastian are 
separated during a shipwreck. 
Once ashore, Viola di.guises 
herself 81 a boy page named 
Cesano, and enters the service 
of the lovesick Duke Orsino. 
Or.ino .ends Viola/Cesario 
(she has now fallen in love with 
the Duke) to woo · the 
unresponsive Lady Olivia. 
Olivia promptly falls in love 
with the youthful Viola/Cesa· 
no. 

The comic complications 

multiply as the relationships 
grow more tangled, and IU Sir 
Toby Belch, O~via'. cousin, 
plots a practical joke on the 
puritanical Malvolio. But as 
Viola comments, time "must 
untangle this, not I;/It i, 100 
hard a knot for me t'untie." 

Produced by the BBC, 
Twelfth Night is a charming 
but restrained effort. The pace 
should be faster and the 
comedy played more broadly, 
especiaUy in the comic subplot 
jnvolving Malvolio. The 
action in the subpiot must be 
played farcically or else

Malvolio becomes pathetic 
and ruins the mood of the play. 
In this area, the BBC 
production could use a more 
exaggerated style. Outside of 
these chwbacks, the play is 
appealingly lighthearted. 

This production succeeds 
best at casting the supportiq 
roles. Alec McCowen deliverS 
a classic performance 81 the 

p~mpou" narcissi.tic 
Malvolio. McCowen captures 
Malvolio's haughty cisdain of 
the other characters perfectly, 
and makes him ~ for the 
comic onslaught of Sir Toby 
Belch. T evor Peacock 81 the

excellen,. He handles the pun. 
filled dialogue with precision, 
and the melancholy song. with 
poignancy. 

felicity Kendall as Viola 
and Sinead Cusack as O~via 
both give bright performances. 
The lovesick Orsino is dully 
played by Clive Arrindell. In 
fact, mosl of the lovesick 
young men (Orlando, Romeo 
and now Orsino) that appear 
in The Shakespeare Plol/' are 
played with the same bland 
style. 

The Shokapeare PiaII' is a 
highly commendable pro;ect 
but in order ' to fuIfiD its 
potential, it will have to 
become leas stilted and more 
inspired. This version of 
Twelfth Night is very 
enjoyable but it could have 
been a boisterous comedy.

Triton Notes 
Freshman first baseman 

Brian Kummer has had the hot 
bat for the Tritons of late, 
which has made him their 
leading hitter _with a _390 
average. 

Mark Sharpe has finally 
found the stroke also. He has 
coUected 6 hits in his last 15 
trips to the plate, raising his 
average from below .200 to 
.254. As the leadoff hitter, 
Sharpe has to be on the 
basepaths if the Triton offense 
is to work. 

Last. Friday, UCSD's 
designated hitter and backup 
catcher Tony Hicklin suffered 
a bone chip in his foot sliding 
into second base on a 
succellful steal attempt. 
F ortunatdy , Hicklin will be 
able to do some light workouts 
while he is waiting for his foot 
to heal. He'l o®, be out for 
two weeks. The Tritons sorely 
need his bat back in the lineup.

One may ask, what is 
experimental music? "Charles 
Ives, Henry Cowel and John 
Cage experimented with 
sounds that are not considered 
part of the musical realm of 
instruments. They used 
objects that were not built to 
produce sound. Experimenta-
tion was also done with 
electronic means and 
computers. Their ' general 
attitude was to create music 
that has not existed before: It is 
not a t all avant-garde, 
although it has been labeled as 
such by some for lack of 
anything better to call it. 
Sound is all relative; if you 
play with a wierd sound long 
enough it is no longer wierd. 
No adjective applies and you 
are not judgemental with 
sound. Don't expect 
masterpieces; it takes time. Do 
expect a mixture of things," 
say. Francoise. 

Sansusi sums it up the 
Atomicafe experience in one 
sentence, "Atomicafe may not 
be where it'l at all the time, but 
at least it visits now and then. "

Jenkins also said that tuition was 
preferable to reduced student access to 
the university or reducing program 
quality. 

Saxon's controversial statements 
about tuition carne immediately after 
he told the three-member committee 
that he would reserve discussion of 
Prop. 9 cuts until after the governor's 
r mance Department concluded its 
contingency plan, due in two weeks. 

had said last week that $7.6 million 
should be shaved off the $9.S5 million 
from the governor's 1980-81 budget 
for UC. 

Saxon will further clarify the 
university's position on tuition in a 
letter he is presently drafting which will 
be sent personally to all university 
students at the end of this month.

"The 1980-81 governor's budget

level of resources for the university, 
given the limitations of state resources 
and competing demands," said Saxon. 
However, "because of the cuts of the

committee tried to re.tore, any

Mime Gaulin & Co. 
to perform here 

The Paul Goulin Mime Company, led by 
the brilliant Canadian-born, Paris-trained 
mime, Paul Gaulin, will be performing 
Thursday, March 6 at 8:00 pm in UCSO's 
Mandeville Auditorium. The company, 
consisting of Gaulin, Nikki Tilroe, and Peter 
Smith, will perform nine pieces employing 
theatre, mime and mask. 

Gaulin sets the pace with adventurous new 
choreography, that explores the foibles of 
man's drives and passions. lbe dynamism of 
his sketches is enhanced by the corporeal 
training he received under Etienne Decroux and 
Decroux's student Marcel Marceau. Gaulin 
enjoys performing in a variety of styles and 
characters, and thus prefers a small company 
which enables each performer to spend more 
time on stage. He is joined by Nikki Tilroe, a 
professional dancer and puppeteer, whose 
magic ability to look like many different 
characters with only the slightest modification 
of costume, creates the sense of a large 
company of performers. 

The evening's pieces explore the ambition 
and variety of the company. Humor and 
sensitivity are used to convey truthful and tragic 
messages. lbe power of their projection lies in 
their agile acrobatics and poetic evocations of 
movement. The show encompasses an 
impressive use of sound and silence, expressed 
emotion, illusion pieces, and precision 
acrobatics that have brought critical acclaim to 
the company, and to Paul Gaulin as Canada's 
master of mime. 

For further information about the Paul 
Gaulin Mime Company performance,
