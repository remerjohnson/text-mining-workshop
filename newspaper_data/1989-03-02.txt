Petition Drive Launched 

UCSD CO-OPS Continue Battle with 
Administration Over Student Center 

By A.M: BEZZERIDES 
Training Director 

A petition drive launched this 
week by UCSD cooperative mem-
bers to place a referendum on the 
spring ballot marks another step 
in the ongoing battle between the 
co-ops and campus administra-
tion. 

The proposed referendum 
would ask students if they want 
the current Student Center to be 
converted to a center for coopera-
tives and enterprises. 

Co-op members propose that 
the remodeled center be called the 
"Student Cooperative Center," 
and be operated under a man-
agement body completely apart 
from the University Center Board 
and the Price Center. 

A key issue in the referendum 
rests on a proposal to reserve a 

·portion of the quarterly Univer-
sity Center Fee for "the continued 
service of the Student Center and 
that no part of that amount be 
used to subsidize the Price Cen-
ter. " 

The proposal suggests that the 
portion be a $10.50 quarterly fee , 
a two-dollar reduction from the 
$12.50 Student Center fee paid 
before 1984. 

In that year, a referendum pas -
ed which increased the $1 2. 50 fee 
by $25 to result in a $37. 50 Uni-
versitv Center fee . 

University Center Board Dir-
ector Jim Carruthers assures that 
the fee is intended to serve both 
the Price Center and the current 
Student Center. 

In light of the Price Center's 
commercial flavor, however, co-
op members fear that the current 
Student Center will be neglected 
in the future administration of the 

University Center fee. 
"Clearly, the money is going to 

nurture profi ts of the Price Cen-
ter," Groundworks Books mem-
ber Betsy Olsen said. 

Vice-Chancellor of U ndergrad-
uate Affairs Tom T ucker disagrees 
with this assessment , holding that 
co-op members lack evidence that 
they will be neglected in the future . 

He further argued that a prom-
ise has been made guaranteeing 
that money from the $37.50 fee 
will be a llocated fo r a $500,000 
renovation of the current Student 
Center.

Hypnotist Attacked 
Campus Performance

Staff Writer 

Night Parking Proposal Recommended 
In a udden out burst during 

hypnotist Michael Dean's per-
formance at the Muir Cafeteria 
last Thursday, Muir junior Jona-
than Goldstein cha rged and struck 
Dean with a chair, according to 
witnesses and statements by Gold-
stein. 

"I went to cue up a tape for 
the strip-tease part of the show, 
and out of the corner of my eye I 
saw someone coming toward the 
stage. I hadn't heard anyone being 
called, so I was wondering what 
was going on. Then I realized it 
was Jonathan, and I heard him 
say something like 'the show is 
over,' " Donahoe said. By REBEKAH YOUNG 

Staff Writer 

The UCSD Parking Advisory 
Committee has recommended a 
controversial proposal that would 
require people coming onto cam-
pus after 5 p.m. to pay for night-
time parking permits. 

Paying for nighttime parking is 
being proposed because, accord-
ing to Vice Chancellor of Busi-
ness Affairs Steven Relyea, "Some-
body's going to get billed to raise 
the revenue for the upkeep and 
lighting of the lots as well as the 
shuttle and parking structure. If 
we charge people who park only 
at night, daytime permit holders 
won't have all the costs hoisted 
onto them." 

If approved by Relyea, the 
proposal would go into effect 
July I. 

"A decision will be made before 
the end of March," Relyea said . 
""m till waiting to get the advi-
sory committee's report [on the 
recommendation]" he added . 

"The propo al comes from a 
general consensus of the advisory 
committee over the years, " stated 
Howard Finnecy, the assistant 
manager for parking services at 
the UCSD Parking Office. 

"The idea wa born from the 
concerns of the committee," he 
added. 

A.S. President Maynard Dim-
mesdale stated the committee 

merely "rubber stamped" the 
proposal that was given to them 
by the UCSD Parking Office and 
said that the committee didn't 
know the specifics of the proposal. 

"The committee voted on the 
concept that people pay at night." 
Finnecy said. "The mechanics of 
the proposal will be presented 
later on [to the committee]." 

Dimmesdale claimed that the 
Parking 'Office knew the details of 
the proposal but "held them back 
to get the proposal passed." 

"It was a political maneuver," 
he added. "The Parking Office 
didn't have to have the commit-
tee's recommendation but it looks 
good and they can use it for 
further confrontations." 

According to Dimmesdale, the 
proposal would requir~ that park-
ing permits be checked after 5 
p.m. as well as on weekends. 
Parking meters would also be 
checked after 5 p.m., he said , 
adding that students who have 
already bought permits will not 
be charged to park at night. 

Relyea said t hat it has not yet 
been decided how the proposal 
will be implemented, though he 
did explain three ways in which 
the money for these permits might 
be collected. 

"The price of the permit could 
be built into the price Qf a ticket to 
an event happening here at night 
or an Extension class," Relyea 
said . "Or we could et up manned 
kiosks to ell permits or have an 

IltlllJjJti 
Campus religion groups 
discuss evangelism 

automating process where a 
machine dispenses permits. The 
details are still being discussed." 

The revenue raised by the 
nighttime parking fees will go to 
the upkeep of the parking lots, 
increased lighting, additional call 
boxes to call CSO's, and the hir-
ing of additional police, Relyea 
said. 

Extra police officers will be 
hired "to handle the safety of the

According to Colin Dona hoe, 
Goldstein 's housi ng advisor who 
wa helping out with the show, 
toward the end of the show Dean 
was calling hypnotized volunteers 
from the audience back on tage. 

According to Donahoe, Gold-
stein began approaching the stage 
during the performance. 

A. S. Votes to Place 
TG Question on Ballot 

By LAURA PROCTOR 
Senior Staff Writer 

The A.S. ouncil voted last night to let the students answer the 
question "should the ASUCSD provide fund for free beer at 
TGs?" 

The TG referendum in itself will not have the power to bring 
an end to free beer at TGs. The vote would be advisory, which 
means it is a way to find out how the students feel about the issue. 

Warren Sophomore Senator Tina Maher, who submitted.the 
referendum, said, "I'm not doing this because I'm for or agamst 
the TGs,"but added that "students have the right to vote on what 
happen to their student fees ." 

A.S. President Maynard Dimmesdale favored the mea ure. 
He aid it was an issue that needed to be settled , and that he 
talked to many "people concerned about alcohol at TGs."

GOldstem offered the following 
explanation for his actions. 

"Part of me felt like it was just 
getting out of hand," he said . "I 
was trying to motion to Colin to 
cut the action [on stage], but he 
admitted to me later that he hadn't 
seen me. 

" I felt like the people under 
hypnosis were being em barassed," 
Goldstein continued. "[Dean] had 
them hypnotized to forget every-
thing, but what about the aud-
ience? They weren't hypnotized. 
Mesmerized, maybe, but not hyp-
notized ," Goldstein said. 

"At fir t I was ju t trying to get 
[Donahoe and Dean] to stop the 
tape," he added, "then I wanted to 
stop the whole show, after I re-
alized that nobody saw me." 

Goldstein said he then picked 
up a chair from where he had 
been standing, by the piano at the 
right side of the tage. 

When Dean was not looking, 
Goldstein said h charged the 
tage and hit him on the back with 

the chair. 
According to Donahoe, the 

chair was of a fairly heavy, wood-
en, emi-circular type that weighed 
approximately 10 to 15 pounds. 

"[Dean] thought that Jonathan 
wa hypnotized and he kept snap-
ping his fingers and telling him to 
come out of it, but he wasn't hyp-
notized," Donahoe said.

Santa Barbara African-American 
Students Condemn Intra-Racial Bias 

SANTA BARBARA - UCSB African-American 
students denounced intra-racial racism in a panel dis-
cussion Monday, Feb. 13, directing much of their crit-
icism toward the media, which they said perpetuates 
the belief that light-skinned African-Americans are 
more attractive than, and thus superior to, dark-
skinned African-Americans. 

Black Studies Chair Gerald Horne also said the 
matter of discrimination on the basis of color will 
possibly become more prominent in international 
economic affairs as the "baton of the capitalist empire 
is passed from London to ew York to Tokyo." 

Accordmg to Horne, for the first time in the last 
500 years, a non-white nation will be dominant in the 
world economy - a phenomenon which could have 
long-range effects on white American society.

Man Follows UCLA Student to 
Dorm, Charged With Sexual Battery 

LOS ANGELES - An unemployed Los Angeles 
man stood trial Feb. 22 for' the alleged sexual assault 
of a UCLA student in her room in a university-owned 
residence hall. 

Ayoola Raheem Olatunji, 24, appeared in Los 
Angeles County Municipal Court to face misdemea-
nor charges of sexual battery, battery, fal e impri-
sonment and trespassing, the court clerk said. 

Olatunji allegedly assaulted the student Jan. 16, 
after he followed her into a third-floor room in Dyk-
stra Hall, univer ity police said. 

After closing the door behind him, Olatunji 
allegedly wrestled the t 8-year-old freshperson onto a 
bed and asked her for ex. 

He allegedly pulled up the student's sweater before 
she struggled free. 

The incident occurred well before 7 p.m., the time 
when residenc:: hall officials restrict building access 
for unchaperoned visitor. 

Although lobby doors of all university residence 
halls can be opened only by those with acce s cards, 
Olatunji probably followed a student into Dykstra , 
said Carole Barber, security manager for UCLA's 
housing program.

Semi-Automatic Assault Rifle 
Discovered In CS US Fraternity House 

SACRAMENTO - Sheriffs deputies confiscated 
an AK-47 assault rifle and arrested two California 
State University, Sacramento students early Tuesday 
morning, Feb. 14, as a result of a quarrel at the Tau 
Kappa Epsilon fraternity. 

CSUS students Christopher Chavez, 22, and FIo-
rentino Lozano, 20, were arrested for drunken and 
disorderly conduct while trespassing on the fraterni-
ty's private property. 

A TKE member and owner of the AK-47 fired four 
shots into the air while in front of the fraternity house 
to scare away the intruder who had broken into the 
front door of the TKE house, said Mark McClintock, 
president of the Theta Upsilon chapter. 

McClintock said that after a Friday night party, an 
argument occured between two non-fraternity stu-
dents. But the argument ended when one fraternity 
member intervened. 

Throughout the rest of the weekend, McClintock 
said that the fraternity members received threats over 
the telephone. " We weren't terribly concerned at that 
point beau e once in a while we get phone calls like 
that, it's a common thing," he said . 

McClintock said that the AK-47 was used for 
self-defense. 

A a result of the Tueday morning incident, 
McClintock held an emergency meeting where he put 
into effect a ban of any kind of weapon on the TKE 
property.

UCLA Volunteers to Offer Help 
To Students Filing Income Tax Forms 

LOS ANGELES - Students at UCLA will soon 
be able to get free help filling out state and federal 
income tax forms . 

Even students who do not plan to file this year 
because they have not earned enough money may still 
benefit, said Mark Jessee, financial supports 
commissioner. 

Jessee, who organized the program, said that stu-
dents who rent non-university owned housing are 
entitled to a $50 renter's credit from California even if 
they do not owe taxes. However, student renters will 
not receive their money unless they file tax returns. 

To help these and other UCLA students with more 
complex tax problems, Jessee said he used the IRS's 
Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program to train 
180 UCLA students. 

IRS employees tutored the volunteers for two 
hours a week for the past month. Sixty people passed 
the final exam and will begin helping students. 

The student volunteers will also be traveling to 
retirement homes and community centers on Satur-
days to help the pUblic.

UCSF Employee Investigated For 
Alleged Long-Term Embezzlement 

SAN FRANCISCO - A former purchasing em-
ployee for the department of biochemistry is under 
investigation by the San Francisco Di trict Attorney 's 
office for alleged embezzlement of at least $250,000 
over a 10-year period. 

UCSF attorney Joseph Cowen said that last De-
cember another biOChemistry department purchasing 
employee uncovered what look:ed like false records on 
lab supplies. Then the campus internal audit depart-
ment, in conjunction with the campus police, turned 
up the apparent scam involving billing for lab sup-
plies. The purchasing agent allegedly had established 
dummy corporations which, over a IO-year-period, 
used phoney invoices to collect for supplies never 
provided. 

The funds were primarily drawn from grants 
received from the federal Department of Health and 
Human Services. At least 28 different awards are 
involved. UCSF is responsible for making good on 
any lost funds.

allegedly beating his wife and possessing a rifle and a 
revolver on university property, campus police said. 

Russell Thornton, a professor in his first year of 
teaching sociology at UC Berkeley, was charged with 
one felony count of spousal battery and one felony

Melissa Thorton had sustained visible bodily injuries, 
and told police that her hu band possessed weapons 
in his room. 

The officers then went into the bedroom and ques-
tioned Russell Thornton. After Thornton admitted

Project 
Discussed 
By RISA GECHTMAN 
Contributing Writer 

Kay Ryon, a Third College sen-
ior, met with a staff member 
from the San Diego AIDS Pro-
ject (SOAP) a nd a Third College 
administrator on Feb. 23 to dis-
cuss plans for the launching of a 
collaborative campus AI DS pro-
ject. 

According to Ryon, her organ-
ization's goals are to educate the 
general student popUlation as 
well as non-student minorities in 
the San Diego area on AIDS 
issues. She also wants to recruit 
volunteers for the established San 
Diego project. 

"Third College AIDS Project 
will make the campus more aware 
of AIDS in general, and of how 
it affects minorities," Ryon said. 

Ryon views involvement in 
the Third College AIDS Project 
as a remedy for apathy and as an 
acceptance that "AIDS will affect 
all of us at some point in our 
lives, whether it be through a 
family member, a friend, or our-
selves." 

The Third College project will 
also seek to unite campus organ-
izations, and to involve faculty, 
in dealing with a disease that 
"crosses all racial, economic, re-
ligious and sexual lines." 

Richard Hallibrin, the public 
relations director of SDAP (the 
organization . Ryon will collabo-
rate with), described the "primary 

missions," of SDAP. 
"We provide AIDS education 

to prevent the spread of the dis-
ease, and direct services to those 
affected by AIDS." 

Hallibrin identified college stu-
dents and minorities in the San 
Diego community as the "target" 
groups that he feels should be 
better educated with respect to 
AIDS. 

"College students need the 
message because of their high 
rate of sexual activity," he said. 

Another target group he men-
tioned consists of minorities, 
namely blacks and Hispanics. 

"College students 
need the message be-
cause of their high rate 
of sexual activity. " 

-Richard Hallibrin 
"Blacks and Hispanics are dis-

proportionately hard hit," Hal-
librin said. "The representation 
of minorities with AIDS is actu-
ally larger, percentage-wise, than 
minority representation in the 
popUlation at large." 

Ryon's interest in forming an 
AIDS project at UCSD was 
sparked by a mock press confer-
ence held in communications 
professor Aida Bustos' news 
media course. Featured at the 
conference were two representa-
tives from SOAP. 

Bustos, who is also the editor 
of the San Diego Union's Cur-
rents Section; supports Ryon's 
fledgling organization. 

"I'm elated thar information 
from speakers in my class has led 
to a student program. I applaud 
Kay's efforts to meet a need," she 
said.

CO-OPS:FutureDebated Co-op members see the admin-istration's response as one more step in their attempt to control the 
collectives. Continued from pale I 

ing the Student Center," Tucker 
said. 

If the referendum does pass, 
the question of whether it would 
be enforced by the administration 
will still exist. 

Tucker said that regardless of 
whether it passes, a referendum 
plays only an advisory role to the 
administration. 

He explained that this referen-
dum would be the third of its 
kind. Past referenda, he said, 
could not be legally implemented 
and were, thus, turned down. by 
Undergraduate Affairs. 

According to Tucker and Car-
ruthers, the legal wording of prior 
bond contracts with the Univer-
sity prevents the splitting of the 
Student Center Fee in any man-
ner. 

Olsen disagrees. "If it [fee in-
creases and bond contracts] can 
be done, it can be undone," she 
said. 

University Center Board Com-
missioner Evan Weisenfeld said 
that if it were to pass, he would 
recommend to the administration 
that they not honor it. 

He said that "[co-op members] 
are just trying to create a self-
serving board" under the guise of 
an eye-catching fee reduction. 

Co-op members are aware that 
the administration probably will 
not enforce the referendum even 
if it passes. 

Che Cafe collective member 
G. B. Hajim is confident the refer-
endum wilJ pass and that the 
administration will ignore it. 

For this reason, he advocated 
strong language in its wording to 
emphasize the strength of the stu-

dent support that he feels is behind 
it. 

At a meeting Sunday, coopera-
tive members emphasized that 
trying to get the referendum en-
forced would require putting pres-
sure on the administration by 
attracting media attention and 
student protest and could go as 
far as legal action. 

In a Feb. 13 letter to the Guard-
ian, collective members cited the 
administration's failure to follow 
its own procedures in the 1984 
referendum by passing it with 
only a 54 percent approval rather 
than the two-thirds required for a 
new fee . 

Tucker, however, explained 
that there was no violation in pol-
icy because the $25 fee students 
voted for was not a new fee, but 
rather an increase of an existing 
one. Thus, only a 50 percent plus-
one approval was required. 

As co-op members see it, the 
wording of an "existing fee" ver-
sus a "new one" sparks an under-
lying conflict. 

Janet Beach from the New In-
dicator and the Che Cafe colle~­
tives argues that the actions were 
not consistent with administra-
tion policy, because the fee was 
called the "U niversity Center Fee" 
whereas, previously, the $12.50 
fee was called the "Student Center 
Fee" and served only the Student 
Center. 

The $25 increase, Beach argues, 
has to be seen as a new fee because 
it was designed to serve the Price 
Center. 

Therefore, she said, the refer-
endum should not have passed 
without the necessary 67 percent 
approval. 

"I don't know if it's legal or not, 
but it's in their best interests to 
discourage us in any way they 
can'," Olsen said. 

Members such as Jelger Kal-
mijn, from the New Indicator 
newspaper collective, argue that it 
is the duty of the co-ops to carry 
out students' demands. 

Students want what co-ops have 
to offer, he said, citing that last 
year's elections showed that 85 
percent ofthe students supported 
collectives. 

The proposed referendum lists 
priorities of a "Student Coopera-
tive Center" as including man-
agement of its own facility, keep-
ing the Triton Pub, expanding 
co-op services, and the creation of 
an interdisciplinary academic pro-
gram in cooperative economics. 

Petitions printed with the pro-
posed referendum have been 
placed at the co-op storefronts 
since Monday and members will 
continue to circulate copies until 
at least 3,000 signatures have been 
colJected. 

According to A.S. Advisor 
Randy Woodard, the co-ops have 
until 4 p.m., March 22 to turn in 
the petitions showing that a min-
imum of 15 percent of the student 
body would support the referen-
dum. 

This would ensure that the pro-
posed referendum would be placed 
on the Spring A.S. election com-
puter ballot, he said. 

Currently, co-op members are 
issuing a press release to San 
Diego media for a scheduled press 
conference where they will voice 
their intentions and complaints 
against the administration.

We were going to top at Ricci's on our way out of town, to pick up 
her purse. She had managed to grab her birth certificate out of the 
house, but her boyfriend jumped her before she could pack any clothes. 

"He tried to choke m~," she said. " He was like a maniac. He bit me." 
I looked over and saw that her elegant silk blouse was shredded almost 
down to her waist and the once-stylish slit in the front of her skirt was 
now a gaping hole. 

Going back to Ricci's made me nervous - especially with the 
berserk screams of her boyfriend still ringing in my ears - but she 
insisted on getting her purse. 

It made sense, at the time. We were gripped in the throes of a very 
fast day - one of tho e rare little humdingers that comes along once in 
a while and scares you all the way out to that delicate point where fear 
turns into fun .... And now I had a partner, a full-bore whacko who 
was definitely prepared to rumble. And also to prevail. 

That is a special attitude which not everybody Understands ... . But I 
did, and by the time we got to Ricci's I understood our situation well 
enough to know that my real problem was that I'd fallen In love with 
this woman, and that the next few minutes or hours or maybe even 
weeks of our life would be like rolling thunder and far too fast for logic. 

I PULLED VP in front of Ricci's. The only other car parked nearby was a queer looking hump-back truck with huge wheels and black windows. I made a quick V-turn and tucked the convertible 
in right behind it, trying to stay in the shadow . 

It was a LamborghInI Jeep WIth no colol at all - a stainless-steel 
brute of a machine with six wheels and bulletproof windows and a 
50-caliher machine-gun mounted behind the cab. 

Jilly leaned over and kissed me - then she slid across the seat and 
opened the door. 

"Don't worry," she whispered. "Dave's working tonight. He's a 
friend. I trust him completely." 

Just then, a huge Japanese gentleman stepped out of the Lambor-
ghini - and Jilly went wild. She leaped back in the car and screamed, 
"God! It's them! The Yakuza! They know me. They work for him." 

I slammed the car into low and took off, once again, for wherever we 
were going ... and the Lamborghini pulled out right behind me. 

I knew the Yakuza: They were a gang oftattooed thUgs out of Tokyo 
who got into the Power Business by offering a debt-collection service 
that included dumping a truckload of pig entrails in the front yard of 
anybody who owed money. 

They made no secret of their skills - if only because they worked. 
There are a lot of ways to fend off the bill collector, but getting nasty 

with people who are about to dump 600 raw swine bladders on your 
front porch is not one of them. 

Jilly was hysterical as the huge Lamborghini pursued us through one 
red light after another along J Street at 90 miles an hour ... and I knew 
they were only in third gear. A recent road test on the "Lambo" said it 
will do I 09 in fourth and 133 on a downhill glass road in fifth .... 

So I knew we were doomed when the brute came up beside me at 
110. 

EDITOR'S NOTE: 
At this point in the editorial process, Dr. Thompson was tragically 

interrupted by a telephone call regarding the horrible death of his 
long-time friend and spiritual adviser, Russell Chatham, the famous 
Montana artist. 

Thompson went immediately into seclusion after hearing the news 
and we were forced to suspend publication of Part IV in his long-
awaited classic: "JILLY & THE NIG H T MA NAGER." 

The saga will continue whenever Dr. Thompson is able to conquer 
his grief and write professionally once again. 

Close friends say he is "feeling fine ," but doubts remain in the 
journalistic community about Thompson's ability to shrug off the 
shock of Chatham's ghastly death . 

First reports said the artist was fly-fishing in a river near his home 
when he was accidentally hooked by a trolling boat and dragged away 
into deep water - then stabbed to death by members of the boating 
party who "reeled him in and gaffed him like a big catfish," they said -
unaware that they were slaughtering a famous human being. 

Meanwhile - at Thompson's crude and distu rbing log home in 
Woody Creek, Colorado - his crafty executive counselor, Semmes 
Luckett, stunned a hastily called press conference by confirming that 
Dr. Thompson will be formal executor of Chatham's earthly estate and 
sole trustee of a bizarre handwritten scroll of " Personal Bequeath-
ments" by the artist, long known as "profoundly eccentric" and a 
hillbilly dilettante who somehow accumulated great wealth. 

Thompson's fee, alone - as executor - will be 22 percent or $22 
million, whichever is greater. 

Luckett also confirmed that Dr. Thompson will leave "very soon" 
for an extended tour of Australia.

Editor: 
This is an open letter, ad-

dressed to the majority of indi-
viduals within cience-related 
majors regarding their opinion-
ated views of the "lesser" non-
scie nce oriented students. I believe 
that I speak for many (and if not, 
that's okay with me) , when I say 
that I am fed up with the condes-
cending and pretentious remarks. 
I have often heard that there is 
absolutely no comparison what-
soever between the work of the 
"easy" majors, a nd those of the 
hard sciences. 

As an undergraduate who is 
stUdying political_science, I work 
damn hard, and even if the curves 
on the examinations aren't abo-
minably low, there is no corres-
ponding compromise of difficulty. 
Not everyone gets an 'A~' a nd in 
fac t, in the Revel/ations listing of 
last year, the average GPA of of 
poli-sci majors was just under 3.0 
.- within .-15 of that of ECE's 
majors. While taking nothing 
away from you who consider 
yourselves scientists, I am only 
asking for ome respect . 

Don't belittle my tasks or suc-
cesses as results of what is, in your 

view, an inferiQr program of study, 
as I work very hard to become 
proficient. When was the last time 
your read 600- 1000 pages of ma-
terial - per week (i nclusive of a 
16-unit schedule)? In addition to 
the reading, which i often theo-
retical in nature and requires care-
ful analysis, there are numerou 
and often lengthy paper. l,"his 
past quarter, I've had six papers, 
varying in length from five pages 
to a debilitating 14 pages (and this 
is usually average). These of 

course, are interspersed through-
out a quarter of strategically-mis-
placed midterms. 

All of these details are not a 
veiled cry for sympathy or pity, 
but rather a quest for mutual 
respect. 'I'm tired of hea ring, "Let 
him do it, he's got to have the time 
- he' a poli-sci major." Please 
think about your words. 1 respect 
your field of study, now how 
about some mutual recognition.

ATTACK 
Continued from pale 1 

According to witness Dave 
Wentz, a Muir fresh person, "No 
one paid much attention to [Gold-
stein] at first because the hypno-
tist was playing a record to get all 
the people who were hypnotized 
to come back on-stage to do this 
strip-tease. Some people thought 
maybe he was supposed to bring 
the chair on-stage or something." 

According to another witness, 
Muir freshperson Dan Macuga, 
"Goldstein came out of the crowd 
with the chair and charged Doc-
tor Dean. The chair splintered 
when it [hit himr 

"After thal," Macuga con-
tinued, "Goldstein tried to run 
out, but Blue [Robbins, the as-
sistant resident dean at Muir Col-
lege] took him outside to talk to 
him." 

Goldstein said that "Blue pulled 
me aside and asked me what the 
heck I was doing." 

When asked on Monday about 
the incident, Robbins responded 
only by saying that "the situation 
has been handled." 

One witness speculated on 
Goldstein's motive for the attack. 

"My friends and I guessed that 
[Goldstein] just got mad because 
the hypnotist was making one of 
his suitemates look bad," Macuga 
said. 

"When I saw my suitemate 
twist his ankle on stage doing the 
ballerina dances [under hypno-
sis], it got me a little preoccu-
pied." Goldstein said. "he [is] not 
a really good friend, but he [is] a 
fun gIlY." 

According to Donahoe, the 
show was allowed to continue 
despite the disruption and cam-
pus police were not involved. 

Housing Advisor Mark Chu-
berka confirmed Donahoe's tate-
ment. 

"Things just got a little out of 
hand, but the student was escorted 
out and campus security was not 
involved," Chuberka said . 

Commenting on his conduct at 
the performance, Goldstein said, 
"My only regret is that I didn't 
have an opportunity to apologize 
to [Dean], but thank God he 
wasn't hurt . 

"I'm a bit ashamed," he con-
tinued. "But people have been 
really supportive. I wouldn't say 
they've been sympathetic; no one 
is condoning what I did. But they 
understand that I did have a right 
to be angry." 

Goldstein added that, during 
. the past quarter, he has been 
under an unusual amount of 
stress. 

"Before the show, I had just 
come off a long series of bad luck.

Just seemed like everything came 
down on me at once." 

According to Goldstein, he has 
had emotional problems in the 
past and is currently on medica-
tion for depression. 

"Once in a while I blow my 
top," Goldstein said, "but as long 
as there aren't a whole lot of 
things caving in on me at once, I 
remain pretty placid." 

Goldstein said that he has been 
in contact with Psychological I 
Counseling Services in the past 
and commented that, "They've 
recommended a psychiatrist for 
me to contact and it seems that 
the whole college is involved. It 
seems like lately more and more 
of my life has become less and less 
private," he said. 

"In a way J think the publicity 
helps me because more people 
know what I'm going through .• 
actually don't mind people know-
ing about it," Goldstein said . 

After the incident, Goldstein 
was notified by Muir Dean Chips 
Dreilinger that he was possibly in 
violation of certain articles of the 
student conduct code. 

"I received a copy of the stu-
dent conduct code with a letter 
from the dean attached request-
ing a meeting with me at the earli-
est possible convenience," Gold-
stein said . 

The meeting between Goldstein 
and Dreilinger took place on 
Tuesday. 

Goldstein has been placed on 
probation for the rest of the cal-
endar year, he said, following his 
meeting with Dreilinger. 

"If I don't do anything else like 
this . nothing further will happen 
to me," Goldstein added, saying 
"I do want to write a letter of 
apology to Doctor Dean when I 
find the time." 

PARKING 
Continued from pale 1 
community. not to check for 
permits and give out tickets," 
Relyea added. "The CSOs or 
parking attendants might issue 
citations for parking violations." 

The revenue will also be put 
into a parking fund, Relyea added, 
and will be used for a long-term 
plan for a parking structure at the 
corner 'of Gilman and Meyers. 

"The plans for a parking struc-
ture are being discussed; it's being 
planned for the early 90s." Relyea 
stated. 

Dimmesdaleexpressed opposi-
tion to that approach in a Feb. 16 
letter to the Guardian in which he 
wrote that "structures and facili-
ties should be built first and then 
paid for. We should increase 
enforcement and fees for parking 
only when adequate parking is 
available. " 

The shuttle service could also 
be expanded using this revenuC\' 
Relyea added, saying that this 
expansion is already underway 
and is "not a result of the night-
time parking proposal." 

Pointing out alternate means 
of generating funds, Dimmesdale 
said that "revenues could be 
created by bonds or by [the charg-
ing of admission to] the parking 
structure ... 

Dimmesdale went on to say 
that Police Chief John Anderson, 
as well as the UCSD Parking 
Office, is behind the proposal. 

"[Anderson is] voting member 
of the [Parking] Committee . .. and 
gets revenue for his department" 
as a result of the increased ticket-
ing that will occur if the proposal 
is approved .• Dimmesdale said. 

Relyea disagreed . 

Thursday. March 2. /989 7 

"The revenue from die citations 
will go to a fund for the alterna-
tive transportation program. It 
doesn't go to [police] salaries," 
Relyea said. 

Dimmesdale sees the proposal 
as a means to get more students to 
buy permits. In his Feb. 16 
Guardian letter he stated that 
"more students, staff and faculty 
will be purchasing parking per-
mits because of. . . the need to have 
a permit to park on campus in the 
evening and weekends." 

Dimmesdale and Student 
Advocate Bard-Alan Finlan have 
presented Relyea with a signed 
petition calling for the abandon-
ment of the proposal for ni~ht 
parking permits, Finlan said. 

Finnecy said that students have 
been confused over the wording 
of the petition. 

"Students were under the im-
pression that even if they had 
already bought a permit. they 
would still have to pay extra at 
night," Finnecy said. 

According to Finlan, however, 
"[Finnecy's] accusation is an 
attempt to discredit the [petition's] 
signatures . They [the Parking 
Office] know the proposal has 
universal opposition. 

"Mr. Finnecy is more cunning 
that a wagonload of monkeys." 
Finlan added, "In no way, shape 
or form did we tell people they 
would have to pay more even if 
they already had a permit. " 

Relyea said he would take the 
petition as well as opposing view-
points from other groups affected 
by nighttime parking into consid-
eration when he makes his 
decision. 

"Relyea already decided he was 
going to approve the proposal 
though," Finlan said, "even before 
he got the petitions." 

He also stressed that the ques-
tion would "generate a lot more 
interest" in the spring elections. 
Voter turnout among upperclass 
students, he said, is typically low 
because a lot of juniors and seniors 
think, "Hey, we're going to be off 
the campus anyway."

According to Dimmesdale, 
older students would be more 
likely to vote if they thought free 
beer at TGs might end. Student 
Advocate Bard-Alan Finlan, like 
Maher and Dimmesdale, pointed 
out that putting the referendum 
on the ballot does not necessarily 
signal opposition to free beer at 
TGs. 

He said he had attended a TG 
and "was impressed by a lot of 

tioning the Council that "by vot-
ing against [the referendum], 
you're saying the Cou ncil is afraid 
[of student input]." 

The Council passed the mea-
sure in a roll-call vote, with all 
members favoring the referendum 
except Public Relations Commis-
sioner Tom Rhee. 

The Council later approved 
giving the California Review 
$1 ,425 from the General Unallo-
cated Fund to help the paper meet 
its current printing costs. 

A spokesperson for the paper 
said that one of the publication's 
main outside funding sources had 
been cut, which was why more 
money was needed.

Religious Groups 'Bring People to Jesus' 
By THERESA N. DUQUE 
Guardian Intern 

Evangelism is a loaded word. 
Mention it, and you11 definitely 

get a reaction. It depends on who 
you are, your faith and your 
knowledge of what the word 
"evangelism" actually mean. 

An informal survey indicated 
that many UCSD students dis-
trust evangelism. They relate it to 
television evangelists such as Jim 
and Tammy Bakker, hypocrisy, 
greed, or even fanaticism. When 
people think of "evangelists, "they 
think of pressuring others 
to convert. 

Although Christian groups such 
a Campus Crusade for Christ 
and Inter-varsity Christian Fel-
lowship (IVCF) describe what 
they do as evangelism, they feel 
undeserving of the TV evange-
lists '. reputation. 

"I'd say that there's a lot of mis-
conceptions about evangelists," 
said sophomore Janelle Kosonen, 
an IVCF member. "A lot of the 
times, [the television evangelistsl 
purpose is to get money, We just 
serve the purpose of God which is 
to spread his word. [TV evange-
lists] might have some other pur-
pose to get people into their 
church; we just want to bring 
people to Jesus." 

Lorraine KeJIey, staff member 
of IVCF, defined evangelism as 
"presenting someone with what 
we think is the truth (according] 
to the gospel of Jesus Christ and 
giving them a chance to respond 
to it." 

lnter-denominational Christian 
groups such as Campus Crusade 
and IVCF believe that they must 
"bring people to Jesus." They feel 
that everybody on earth should 
have the opportunity to accept or 
reject what Jesus had to say. 

According to Campus Crusade 
for Christ staff member Galen 
Thomas, Jesus' gospel includes 
the following four points: 

• God loves you and offers a 
wonderful plan for your life; the 
Bible commands and [Christians] 
teach. 

• Humans are sinful and sep-
arated from God. 

• Jesus Christ is God's only 
provision for humanity'S sin. 

• We must individ ually receive 
Jesus as Savior and Lord. 

Like IVCF, Thomas empha-
sized that everyone has the choice 
whether or not to accept these 
four points. 

One student, who wished to 
remain a nonymous, offered a dif-
ferent opinion. 

,,[Evangelists] sort offorce it on

you in a way; for example, on 
campus, people come up and ask 
you to a Bible study. It's hard to 
say no because you start to feel 
guilty, especiaJIy if you are re-
ligious. " 

IVCF and Campus Crusade 
members said causing guilt is not 
their purpose. 

.. As Christians, we really believe 
that [the Bible] is true. One of the 
things that Jesus ays is, 'Go and 
tell people.' We feel that that's a 
mandate and that we need to do 
that. We don't agree with any 
pressure tactics or manipUlation, 
but we feel that it's our respon-
sibility to tell people and to give 
them a chance to respond them-
selves," Kelley explained. 

If people are free to choose, 
then why do so many people dis-
trust the motives of evangelists? 
Campus Crusade and I VCF see 
evangelism as something good, 
while so many perceive evange-
lism as something bad . 

Perhaps this is because evan-
gelism is confused with prose-
lytizing. 

According to Pastor John 
Huber of the University Lutheran 
Church, "Christianity, by defin-
ition, is to share faith with every-
one. Evangelism means to hare 
the good news of Jesus Christ or 
the gospel, but proselytizing is to 
impose your faith on others who 
don't want to receive it. Prosely-
tizing would also be the attempt 
to convert Christians from other 
denominations into your own 
denomination ...

of Religious Affairs, as Rabbi 
Douglas Slotnick points out. 

"In a number of ways, they do 
not wish to cooperate with this 
office." Rabbi Slotnick, the direc-
tor of Jewish Campus Centers at 
UCS D. "But we would not try to 
remove them from this campus. 
They are free to do what they 
want until they start to interfere 
with students' lives. 

"It's the proselytising aspect of 

evangelical groups that we object 
to ," Rabbi Slotnick continued. 
"It's [one thing] to present a form 
of Christianity to students on 
campus in an informational way 
.... It's another thing to do it in a 
dishonest way." 

Campus Crusade and IVCF 
refer to themselves as interde-
nominational, meaning that 
members have different religious 
backgrounds, including Roman 

Catholic, Baptist and Presbyter-
ian . The practice of evangeHsm 
unites those of varied religions 
through one goal : teaching Jesus' 
gospel. 

Inter-denorninational Christian 
groups like Campus Crusade, call-
ed Parachurches, stress the im-
portance of "evangelizing" and 
not "proselytizi ng." 

"If someone is adamant in their 
belief and not interested in talking 
to us, we won't bother them," 
Thomas said . "When I provide 
the four-points , I'm doing noth-
ing more than providing a choice, 
providing information to make 
an intelligent decision." 

"No one is ever forced to accept 
Jesus. The essence of witnessing 
and evangelism is to give every-
body an equal chance, a fair 
chance to hear the gospel of Jesus 
Christ," explained Bryant Yang, 
UCSD sophomore and IVCF 
member. 

Instead of fairness and choice, 
one student said, "Evangelism tries 
to impose a Christian culture on 
non-Christian culture, (causing] 
more conflict [between the two)." 

During spring break, Campus 
Crusade members can attend Mis-
sion to Mazatlan, "a week of sun, 
fun, beach evangelism, and show-
,ing the Jesus movie to villages" 
accordingto an information pam-
phlet provided by UCSD's Cam-
pus Crusade. During this trip, 
Campus Crusade teaches gospel

SEED Offers Peace Corps-Style 
Education and Experience 

By GINNY SUNDAY 
Guardian Intern 

I f you are not quite ready to devote two years of your life 
to the Peace Corps, but are 

still interested in improving the 
quality of human life, an organi-
zation called Students Encourag-
ing Education and Development 
(SEED) offers local opportuni-
ties. This organization offers stu-
dents a chance to participate in 
positive and direct action without 
the two-year commitment that 
the Peace Corp requires. 

SEED is the local chapter of 
the nationwide mother organiza-
tion called Overseas Development 
Network (ODN). SEED and 
ODN seek to educate students 
and to promote projects which 
improve the living standards of 
poor people . Unlike many chari-

ties which provide temporary relief 
to the poor, SEED devotes its 
efforts to programs which per-
manently improve living stand-
ards through development. 

According to member Leo 
Glaser, "Once a community re-
ceives some of the benefits of one 
of our programs, the results will 
make a lasting change in their 
way of thinking and doing things." 
The "results" are self-sustaining 
because the program teaches the 
underprivileged skills. which may 
increase job opportunities. 

The latest SEED project was 
the cosponsorship of a run and a 
fast in which SEED was able to 
raise approximately $900, These 
funds were then donated to an 
organization called North County 
Chaplaincy, a group dedicated to 
helping the plights of the migrant 
workers in the orth County. Ac-
cording to Glaser, many of the

in solvin~ housing problems. 

SEED chose to spon or the 
North County Chaplaincy because 
it dealt with a problem that was 
close to home. Glaser explained 
that one purpose of the project 
was to allow participants to see 
how they have made impact on 
the conditions of the local com-
munity. 

Participation in grass-roots 
projects initiated by the local com-
munity is one way SEED offers 
students a sense of involvement. 
Members recently completed a 
project at the Colonia Panameri-
cano in Tijuana. Through funds 
raised by SEED members, a clinic 
was set up to provide medical care 
at a nominal cost to the patients, 

A fundamental way of achiev-
ing SEED's goal of development 
is through education. SEED hopes

Vegas Lucky for Swimmers 
Las Vegas proved to be a 

lucky town for the Triton swim 
team last weekend. At the Pa-
cific Collegiate Swim Confer-
ence, five Tritons qualified for 
post-season action. 

In a "sink" or "swim" pre-
dicament, Lauren Royce and 
Julie Rankine outswam their 
competitors and qualified for 
Nationals in the la t women's 
meet of the season. Thirteen 
swimmers and two divers will 
now prepare for the women 's 
NCAA championships, which 
will be held March 9- 11 at 
Notre Dame. 

For the men's team, the re-

cent qualifications of Josh Har-
ris, Marc WilJick and Doug 
Smith have heated up the com-
petition for post-season bids. 
With one meet still remaining 
in the season, 20 swimmers 
and a diver are currently eligi-
ble for Nationals. Because he is 
only permitted to carry 18 
members on his Nationals ros-
ter, Head Coach Bill Morgan 
will make his choices next 
week. 

The Triton men's team will 
challenge Claremont-Mudd-
Scripps on the road this Sat-
urday for its final meet of the 
regular season.

A Perspective on the Trouble-Ridden Sports World 

Shooting Stars: Today's Athletes 
Give the Term New Meaning 

By DAVID ponCHA 
Contributing Writer 

A couple of decades ago a 
"shooting star" could be seen as 
an athlete on the way to a bright 
future . Times have changed. To-
day's shooting star prefers not to 
shoot baskets or shoot through 
defensive lines, but rather to shoot 
others or shoot up. In today's 
world , the average athlete is a 
criminal. Colleges are fuJl of vio-
lence, drugs, recruiting violations, 
racism , and misconduct. The pro-
fessional ranks have many of these 
same problems. 

What exactly has gone rotten? 
The answer, in general, is that the 
integrity of the at hlete has gone 
down the tubes. Why this decay 
has happened is not such an easy 
question to answer. Some people 
seem to think that coaches place 
winning above everything, and 
the athletes they recruit are not of 
the same moral quality as before. 

For instance, both Mississippi 
and Northeast Louisiana recently 
fought over senior Roosevelt 
Potts. This guy scored a nine on 
the ACT, and was accused of fir-
ing a loaded shotgun into a crowd. 
Is this the kind of athlete that two 
schools should battle for? Is this 
the kind of athlet; that idols are 
made of? 

Substance abuse is on a major 
upsurge, and more suspensions 
and stories are written on this sub-

· ~ct than ever before. 
On the professional level, Law-

rence Taylor of the New York 
Giants, arguably one of the best 
linebackers ever to play football, 
has been susp.ended from the NFL 
twice and is a violation away from 
lifetime expUlsion. New York 
Mets pitcher Dwight Gooden, 
another sports superstar, has been 
busted for both alcohol and drug 
abuse, and is still battling to rec-
over. Chuck Muncie and Fulton 
Walker, both former pro football 
players, were also recently arrested 
for possession. 

Substance abuse in the colleges 
is just as rampant as it is in the 
pros. Oklahoma Sooners Quar-
terback Charles Thompson was 
recently arrested for selling 17 
grams of cocaine worth $1 ,400 to 
an undercover FBI agent. Former 
Sooner All-American linebacker 
Brian Bosworth has accused Barry 
Switzer of knowing about wides-
pread steriod and narcotic use 
among Oklahoma athletes, but 
still allowing it to continue un-
checked. Switzer is Oklahoma's 
head coach. 

Steroids are as widely abused 
as narcotics, if not even more so. 
High school athletes have begun 
relating steroid-induced muscle 
size with success. On any level, 
steroids warrant suspension, and 
rightly so. Just recently a stu-
dent's death was connected to his 
overuse of steroids. Track star 
Ben Johnson, supposedly the fas-
test man in the world, had to sur-
render his gold medal at the 1988 
Summer Olympics because he 
tested positive for steroids. 

What is wrong with these peo-
ple? Granted, some athletes are 
illiterate, but many of these peo-
ple being arrested have functional 
brain cells. An average idiot can 
read enough to see the dangers 
inherent in drug and steroid abuse, 
and yet the problem continues 
almost unchecked, like anepidem-
ic. 

Not only is substance abuse on 
the rise, but there is a tremen-
dous wave of violent crime crash-
ing down upon college campuses. 
Syracuse basketball star Derrick 
Coleman was recently convicted 
of harrassment and disorderly 
conduct for punching a man and 
kicking in a door. Seems he was 
uhappy about a $2.50 cover charge 
at a campus dance. Poor Derrick, 
such a horribly high price to pay 
to get in, certainly worth the 50 
hours of community service he 
must now complete. 

Upcoming UCSD Intercollegiate Sports ... 

Even the Len Bias tragedy 
seems to have passed by with little 
or no effect. A recent Rolling 
Srone article quoted a youth coun-
selor who said kids in his city 
began referring to cocaine as "Len 
Bias" after Bias overdosed on the 
drug. The kids would actually 
say: "Oh, that's Len Bias. Let's get 
that, that's the good stuff." Looks 
like the kids missed the lesson of 
Bias' tragic overdose death. 

Keith Horne, a first year bas-
ketball player at Texas-Sun An-
tonio, was charged with attemp-
ted murder after allegedly beating 
and strangling a female hotel 
employee. Clemson Football

Continued from page 8 
to the people of Mazatlan . 
According to Campus Crusade 
President Kevin Clark , the group 
is not an impo ition. 

"As a Christian , each per on 
has been put in a certain place 
and , ba ically, the Bible tells them 
to reach out to the people who are 
around them," Clark said. Chris-
tians do not force people to accept 
their ideas, he added. 

This "certain place" is called a

they're interested, 
and, if not, we say 
thanks and go on. "

ministry. "A ministry is an area of 
where you spread the word of 
Jesus Christ. Missions are going 
to areas that haven't been reached 
before. For example, on spring 
break, we go down to some place 
like Mazatlan and go to the bar-
rios to talk to people about Christ. 
My field of ministry is here on 
campus. If I were to go on a mis-
sion, it would take me away from 
the campus," Clark said. 

Campus Crusade chose Mazat-
Ian because they follow the thou-
sands of college students who 
vacation there, Thomas explained. 
Upon arrival, the Campus Cru-
sade members head for the beach 
and, like anybody else, start a 
game such as volleyball or tug-of-
war. 

Errata 
In the Feb. 8 article 

"Alpha Project Allows 
San Diego Homeless 
to Help Themselves," 
the Guardian stated 
that the Alpha Project 
provides transitional 
housing for the home-
less. This is a long-term 
goal of the program, 
but it does not yet offer 
transitional housing. 

The article also men-
tioned $16,000- coming 
from the pocket of the 
director, Bob McElroy. 
Although McElroy has 
provided significant 
personal funds to the 
program, the $16,000 
operating budget last 
year came from work 
crews and other fund-
raising activities.

these beach activities deceptive. 
There are, after aU, no visible 
signs of their identity as a reli-
gious grou p (Ii ke the posters IV CF 
displays for their free barbecues). 

Thomas disagrees. "If we were 
to corral people and shut them in 
a room and force [them] to listen 
[to us], that wouldn't be right at 
all .. . but we give them the choice. 
I don't think that's deceptive. If

PHIL'S ANALYSIS ... There's a fast growing 
rumor around campus that they're going to eliminate 
TGs. Why? Your guess is as good as mine, but I heard 
somewhere that UCSD is one of the few colleges 
around that serves free alcohol on campus, and 
because of that, somebody is liable or something. 
Whatever the reason, It makes perfect sense to get rid 
ofTGs. Think about it. We've got an overabundance 
of partying on this campus as it is, and this social 
bedlam has just got to come to an end. It's probably 
too difficult to curb our reputation as an out of con-
trol party school immediately, but the soon-to-be 
eliminated Triton Pub and the soon-after-that elimi-
nation of the TG are unquestionably steps in the right 
direction. After that, it should be easier to persuade 
them to halt the daily addition of our fraternity a~d 
sorority houses on the bustling Greek Row. Quite 
clearly, we've got to stop the madness and get rid of 
the TG. Who's gonna argue?

Oklahoma starting corner hack

Most disturbing is the fact that 
aU of the above incidents were 
covered io two days' worth of 
news in the Los Angeles Times, 

The Rocky Mountain News, and 
Sports Illustrated. 

Colorado University has been 
overwhelmed by this wave ofvio-
lence. The campus itself is beau-
tiful, but it might be better off 
surrounded by jail bars and barbed 
wire. Since February of 1986, over 
24 players have been arre ted for 
major offenses at this school, 
ranging from brawling to rape 
and kidnapping. A great deal has 
been made of the fact that Colo-
rado is only 1.5 percent black, 
and many of the athletes cry 
racism in response to the offenses. 

Academic Coordinator at Co-
lorado Theo Gregory said, "If

Johnson and Frederick Earn Top 
Honors at Ventura Surf Contest 

By C HRIS TORREY 
Contributing Writer 

The UCSD surf team captured 
third place out of 20 overall at the 
first qualifying round for the 
National Scholastic Su rfing Asso-
ciation State CoUegiate Champion-
ships held last weekend in Ven-
tura. Individually, UCSD grabbed 
the top three places , including the 
top finishers in both the men's 
and women's divisions. 

Saturday'S conditions were frus-
trating for competitors becau e of 
the exceptionally large and pound-
ing surf. "It was 10 foot and clos-
ing out," men's winner and team 
captain Allen Johnson said. "All 
you could do was go for one big 
maneuver before the wave crashed 
down." 

On Sunday, the size of the surf 
dropped to five and six foot waves 
with better shape. "The condi-
tions were challenging because of 
the inconsistency ... you never 
knew when a set of waves would 
come in," women's wiJlner Wendy 
Frederick stated. 

Nothing came in during the 
first 12 minutes of our final heat ," 
Frederick pointed out, "we were 
paddling around in circles trying 
to catch something, then finally 
waves started coming in for us." 

Shooting 
Continued from plge 12 

and is free from gun violence. But 
more than two dozen arrests, 
founded or not, is just too much 
to stomach. 

Another major problem with 
athletics does not rest on the 
shoulders of the athletes, but 
rather upon those of the coaches 
and administrators: recruiting 
violations . There are cu rrently 22 
schools on probation for these 
violations, and numerous schools 
under investigation. Oklahoma's 
football team, riddled with vio-
lence and drug abuse, is also on 
probation for three years (no bowl 
games or TV appearances) . Okla-
homa State's football program 
has also been placed on proba-

Team Captain Allen J ohnson pulls a frontside snap with spray. 

Although barely making it 
through an earlier heat, Johnson 
came back to dominate the final. 
"Johnson thought he might get 

disqualified because of an mter-
ference," team member Brad 
Africano said. "But he clearly had 
possession of the wave. He com-
pleted a full turn before driving 
down the line, generating a lot of 
speed and bottom-turned into a 
radical frontside snap which in-
sured his victory." 

Christian Rodenbeck also per-
formed exceptionally well, mak-
ing it to the quarterfinals in his 
firs t contest with the team. Afri-

tion. Looks like Oklahoma won't 
be much of a football state next 
season. 

Kansas Univer ity, the reigning 
NCAA Division I men's basket-
ball champion, is on sus pension 
this year and is conseq uently 
barred from the NCAA tourna-
ment. At North Carolina, a recent 
report showed that IO of 12 men 
who are currently playing bas-
ketball are on academic suspen-
sion, and that 29 of the last 43 to 
play were also on academic sus-
pension. Obviously, the coaches 
at North Carolina are doing every-
thing within their power to push 
the concept ofinteUigent athletes. 

The Southwestern division is 
really hurting. Three of its eight 
schools are on probation and 
another is under investigation. 

See SHOOTING, pice 14 

cano also gained valuable team 
points with his quarterfinal finish. 

While st rong performances 
stood out, a lack of conu::st expe-
rience resulted in weak strategy. 
This became evident as some team 
members were disqualified due to 
technical mistakes during their 
heats. 

The Tritons also need to focjJs 
more on conditioning for paddling, 
as the waves were stro ng and the 
current proved difficult to paddle 
against. 

The next contest is this week-
end at Bolsa Chica State Beach, 
north of Huntington.

The UCSD Guardian 

Shooting 
Continued from pale 13 

SMU is coming off a three year 
death penalty. It wasn 't even 
allowed to field a football team 
during that time period . 

Another problem is misconduct 
and bad behavior among athletes. 
One example of poor attitude in 
the professional ranks is that of 
NBA star Mark Aguirre, formerly 
of the Dallas Mavericks. Accused 
of being a loafer and of "tanking" 
(throwing away games and pur· 
posely playing poorly), he was 
finally traded to Detroit. The 
players didn't lose any sleep over 
his departure. 

An example on the university 
level is Dominican College, a 
school UCSD competes against 

. in many sports. Dominican began 
the year with 16 players on its 
men's basketball team. When it 
played the Tritons, the team was 
down to seven, and had only 
four men on the floor at the end ot' 
the game. 

Even UCSD has its problems. 
Junior Hunter Galloway has been 
dismissed from the men's tennis 
team. Galloway is certainly not 
the first UCSD student to receive 
athletic reprimand, nor will he be 
the last , but he is one more part of 
this a.larming downward spiral 
that athletes seem to be following. 

Is there a solution? Maybe not, 
but certain steps could be taken to 
alleviate some of these problems. 
Sports Illustrated recently pub-
lished a list of reforms that I 
happen to agree with: 
- "Shorten basketball season, 

and eliminate spring practice for 
footbaU. Also, reduce hours re-
quired for practice and film ses· 
sions. 
- Let athletes get off to the right 

academic start by making all 
freshmen ineligible in both sports. 
- Reduce the number offootball 

scholarships and link the new 
number to the school's athlete-
graduation rate. 
- Abolish athletic dormitories. 
- Crack down on steroid use. 
- Certify that recruits are solid 

students and citizens and have the 
potential to become the same by 
making approval of recruitment 
fall to the administration offices. 
- For athletes who don't belong 

in college or don't want to be 
there, let the NBA and NFL start 
their own farm systems." 

None of the above has been 
done, but small advances were 
made this year in response to the 
budding problems in sports. I 
applaud the NCAA and the pro· 
fessional leagues for their su b-
stance abuse policies. I support 
random drug testing, but I do not 
understand how athletes can call 
it an abuse of their rights. If they 
are using drugs, it is t heir fault -
not the system's. They are taking 
a chance by breaking the law, and 
random testing is a way to catch 
them. 

Somehow, somewhere, some-
thing must be done, and it must 
be done soon. We need to get rid 
of those that are abusing the 
system.

The Playoffs 
The regular season IS over 

after a final weekend of trenzled 
rescheduling that was necessary 
when an unnamed woman In a 
coed game tore down one at the 
hoops on the Main-West court 
The p lay occurred In an early 
morning game After posting up 
her detender she took a pass 
down low, took one bounce to 
her left. turned and threw down a 
monster dunk that broke the cable 
holding the basket up Videos of 
thiS sensational game should be 
available In the bookstore by the 
end of the season No one was 
hurt but play was ended for the 
day on that c ourt The 1M staff 
rallied to try to find room for Ihe 
displaced teams and used every 
resource available (Including play· 
Ing games outdoors). but some 
games were not played and had 
to be resceduled for times later 
In the week By the end of tOnight 
all makeup games should be fin· 
Ished and the p layoff picture 
should be crystal clear 

That playoff plclure Includes 
some 981eams In 7 different dlv, 
ISlons All teams that finished In 
the top half of the" league (e .g 4 
teams In an 8 · team league) Will 
be In the tournament Caplalns 
should call or come down to 
Canyonvlew (534·4037) to check 
and see If they made the playoffs. 
All the action starts thiS Sunday 
at 9 a.m . The hoop IS fixed and 
both gyms Will be rocking all day 
and night to get the early round 
games completed Some teams 
Will be plaYing tWice on Sunday 
so look o ver the playoff bracket 
carefully

FROTHY DISCHARGE 
Once again, this week's most outstanding 1M 

team was found in the bowling alley. A 
FROTHY DISCHARGE, A.KA Team #5 
down at Clairemont Bowl (I wonder why?) have 
launched themselves from the "gutter" (bowling 
humor .. , get it?) to sole possession of first 
place in just three matches. These guys and ' 
are playing hot, and with playoffs starting in 
just a couple of weeks, they have a good shot at 
winning it all.

Post-Modem Band 
Colors Music Blue 

by sascha oginz 
hiatus lelUor staff writer 

The name Cowboy Junkies initially conjures up an 
image of some forced, jokey punk band exuding a 
clamor of mixed signals. After hearing The Trinity 
Session, however, one realizes that no name could 
be more appropriate. The signals they mix are those 
of country music, the blues, and contemporary 
urban moodiness. This m~lange is fused with the 
smooth, mysterious voice of Margo Timmins, and 
the simple, talented guitar of her brother Michael. 
The band can be seen this Sunday, opening for 
Michelle Shocked, in Mandeville Auditorium at 8 
p.m. Tickets are $10 for UCSD students and $14 for 
others. 

Since its inception two years ago, the music of the 
Cowboy Junkies has been referred to as "post-
modern melancholy." This is a startlingly accurate 
description. The music is slow, almost lethargic, but 
so poignant it's hypnotic. The Trinity Session seems 
to capture a mood and sustain it so consistently that 
each song blends into the next, making it difficult and 
unnecessary to distinguish between tracks. 

The group consists of three siblings -Margo, 
Michael, and Peter Timmins (on drums) - and their 
longtime friend Alan Anton on bass. Guest musi-
cians play harmonica, fiddle, mandolin, pedal steel 
guitar, and bottleneck slide guitar. The instruments 
fade in and out, creating a sound that is loose, but not 
sloppy. 

"Our music's very drifting, very ethereal," Michael 
Timmins said . "We lay down certain rhythms 
and grooves, establish them, then Margo and I color 
them. Not paint. Color." 

In fact, five of these grooves are laid down by the 
masters. The soulful covers include the Lou Reed 
signature "Sweet Jane." Reed himself referred to the 
Cowboy Junkies' "Sweet Jane" as "the best and 
most authentic version I have ever heard." Also 
included are Hank Williams' "I'm So Lonesome I 
Could Cry," Waylon Jennings' "Dreaming My 
Dreams With You," Patsy Cline's "Walking After 
Midnight," and the traditional "Mining for Gold." 

The Cowboy Junkies' original songs include "Misguided 
Angel," a gentle and convincing'lament, and "200 More Miles," 
an atmospheric, lonely account of life on the road. Although the 
cover songs are initially the most prominent ("Sweet Jane" has 
received a lot of attention from 91 X), the original tracks are 
perhaps the most subtly inspiring. The atmosphere of mystery 
allows the listeners to go into their own personal reveries, led by 
the erotic, yet distant lyrics of Margo Timmins. 

In keeping with the blue, eerie style of the music, The Trinity 
Session was recorded in Toronto 7 s Church of the Holy Trinity. 
The church was chosen for its pure acoustics, and open, natural 
resonance. Also, the album was digitally recorded using only one 
microphone, with no overdubs or edits. As a result, it cost only 
$250 to record - an astoundingly low budget for an album that is 
attracting widespread critical acclaim. 

According to Michael Timmins, "On most records, you end up 
manufacturing songs rather than recording them. We wanted to 
capture the atmosphere of the recording session and the feel of the 
musicians actually playing off each other. The whole day was 
magical. That's why we named the record after the session." 

Clearly the group has achieved the sound it was aiming for. The 
intimate and soulful music is the result of an original and deter-
mined vision. Rather than an accidental or overnight sound, it has 
been nurtured for years. Michael Timmins has progressed 
through a variety of styles: the severe intensity of England's Joy 
Division, improvisational jazz, and Delta blues. During the devel-
opment of the Cowboy Junkies' current sound, sentimental coun-
try tradition was added, and mainstream pop considerations were 
rejected. 

Perhaps the key to the intrigue of the Cowboy Junkies is their 
tendency to express their feelings in a subtle, abstract way. "We 
don't show everything," Michael Timmins said. "We keep a little bit 
hidd " . en. 

The Trinity Session is the aural equivalent of a gray, cloudy 
day in which the sun pokes a few rays down in some opportune 
spots. It's satisfying in an unusual, almost surreal way: an intimate 
encounter with a sensation that is universal.

Many students seem to believe that the only re::lson to attend a 
UCSD theatre production is to get their theatre class requir -
ments out of the way . However, anending a play at UCSD costs 
less than a movie ($5 for students ) and often turns out to be mu h 
better. Such is the case with The Harmanan. 

The Harmarran is named after the ruthless desert wind which 
blows across Chad, Afri a. The play tells the story of a collection 
of Peace Corps workers in Chad, and is based on the experiences 
of the playwright, UCSD graduate student Michael Erickson. 

The two central characters are Tim Royce, a tree-planter with a 
vision of a "Green Revolution" in Chad, and his former girlfriend 
Jane, who is now married to a sruffy capitalist. But much of the 
story also focuses on the peripheral characters. 

Although tht> acting was consistently good, there were some 
notable standouts. Tom dis (Tim) and Georgia Martin Gane) 
were bOth convincing in their roles. Shanga K. Parker's believable 
performance as ausman, Tim's African contact, was also well 
received. However, many of the supporting characters turned out 
to be much more colorful than the leads, and subsequently more 
fun to watch . John Deschaine and Tracy A. Leigh, as an Irish 
oil-driller and his African mistress, almost stole the show with 
their wisecracking banter. Both actors displayed superb timing, as 
well as the ability to uphold foreign accents. Danny Burstein, as 
Mustafa (a Lebanese refugee who is always underfoot), also pro-
vided many laughs. Mark W. Deakins, in a small role as jane's 
unscrupulous husband, was excellent as well.

"As a da ncer, I wanted to take some control over 
my career. Dancers frequently have legitimate gripes 
over how they're treated, but I felt that if I just sat 
around griping and didn't take some constructive 
action. then I had no one to blame but myself," 
said dance d irector Kevin Jeff. 

Atthe age of27, 6'7" Jeff has taken his gripes and 
turned them into the IO-member, Brooklyn-based 
Jubilation! Dance Company. In its sixth year, Jubila. 
tion! tours nat ionwide providing exciting, attractive, 
and cultural dancing for its audiences. Jubilation! will 
perform here at Mandeville Auditor ium o n March 4 
at 8 p.m. 

Saturday night's perfo rmance wilt consist of four 
pieces displaying dance sryles such as ba tlet , mod-
ern, jazz, African and Broadway. One of the works 
to be presented is " Dedication," which Jeff choreo-

graphed in 1982 in memory of the black children 
slain in A tlanta . Jeff has turned such a tragedy into a 
poignant celebration. 

"I reached a point in my o wn thinking where I 
wanted to emphasize that the lives of these child ren, 
no matter how brief, wen: worthwhile. T hey gave us 
valuable things. So I set my dance to an African 
song, which translated means, 'God's c reations are 
indestructible,' .. Jeff said. 

Another work to be performed Saturday night is 
"Flack." The piece is set to songs performed by 
Roberta Flack, Quincy Jones and Donny Hathaway. 
" Flack" is a powerful, half-ho ur-long condensation 
of the American black experience. Jeff has a com-
passionate view of contemporary street life. The 
forced dance-mime episodes express sorrowful and 
despairing alcoholic young men and thei r aban-
doned women and suggest that o ur salvatio n may lie 
in reunion with society's ourC'""r". The two other

Continued from pale 3 
pieces to be performed are "Alsat~

inspired by the birth of Jeff's

No two dancers are alike in size 
or shape in the Jubilation! Dance 
Company. Each has a distinct 
dancing personality as well. The 
10 dancers which make up the 
company "seem to move by an 
unseen, though palpably felt wind, 
and they se m to pass it on from 
one another. The conclusion, 
much more literal, makes a plea 
for understanding and brotherly 
love," said dance critic David 
Connelly.

be enhanced by being a part of this 
community, not just a company. 
Nearly all of us are vegetarians. 
There are no drug problems, and 
there is only one smoker and we 
are working on that. As the direc~ 
tor, I listen to the dancers and try 
to take their ideas into account. 
This is a collaborative company, II 
Jeff said. 

Jubilation! is also an energetic 
company and tends to get enthu~ 
siastic responses from the audi~ 
ence. "We encourage audience 
participation. That entails a respect 
for the dancers and the work. In 
any conversation, people have to 
listen. But there's a wonderful 
tradition in black culture, which 
allows feelings to flow freely 
between the performers and the 
audience. We like that free 
exchange," Jeff said. 

Play

If you are getting the impres~ 

sion that The Harmattan is not a 
heavy~handed drama, you're right. 
Of course, it is about foreign aid 
to Africa, and about the "first 
world" helping the "third world." 
Many serious points are made 
about the ethics of such "help." 
But Michael Erickson made sure 
to include many humorous lines 
to break up the tension. Overall, 
the play was an excellent blend of 
serious drama and light humor. 

The sets were very spars~ and 
few props were used. The lack of 
scenery helped to emphasize the 
barrenness of the environment. 
The lighting also helped to create 
the setting, as in the desert scenes 
when the set was brilliantly illum~ 
inated with yellow light. 

One problem, however, was in 
the staging of the play. I don't 
know if this happened because of 
the shape of Warren Theatre, but 
the audience was often treated to 
an actor's back as he or she said 
the lines. During one five~minute 
dialogue between Tim and Jane, I 
think I saw Jane' face once. 
Although realistic, this proved 
annoying at times. 

All in all, The Harmattan is well 
written , acted and directed (by 
UCSD alumnus Walter Schoen). 
So next Friday night think about 

hecking out a UCSD theatre 
produ rion. It may be worth your 
while.
