by DaJl St. Claire 8acoD 
S&aIf Writer 

Last week's lecture on the. 
"origin of life" featured an 
evening that proved to be both 
thought provoking and enter-
taining due to the spirited 
discussions (If three highly 
respected thinkers, Dr. Francis 
Lrick, Dr. Leslie Orgel and Sir 
Edward Bullard. 

Crick, Nobel Prize winner in 
1962, gave a brief summary of 
how life is forumulated. He 
noted that a system must 
evolve by natural selection and 
be able to produce offspring. 
What follows then is that the 
successful offspring will. 
duplicate themselves and 
entire colonies, while the 
unsuccessful offspring will be 
weeded out by what was termed 
" the process of natural 
selection.' ,

Emphasizing the notion of 

"chance," Crick stated, "After 
natural selection a rare event 
which happens to be favorable 
can be made common. That is 
the essence of natural selec-
tion. "

Detailing that the basis of 
natural selection lies in two 
groups of molecules, the 
nucleic acids aDd Die prolelris-: 
talking about the need for the 
cell to make an exact copy of 
itself. 

Crick also stressed that the 
sequence of chemical letters in 
the nucleic acids and in the 
amino acids of protein "are of 
vital significance." The result 
of one letter out of place, or one 
amino acid out of place, can 
cause a mutation. Whether that 
mutation is favorable or not 
will be determin~ by natural 
selection. 

An interested audience asked 
numerous questions of the 
speakers. Perhaps thinking on 
the line, "What came first, the 
chicken or the egg?" one 
student asked, "In the begin-

More than 65 percent of 
UCSD underlraduates are 

-commuters, but ''the colleges 
are oriented toward residents," 
said Gordon Carlson, of the . 
Warren College Commuter 
Board. . . 

The commuter board repre-
sents a growing activism on the 
part of students who live off 
campus. The board, chaired by 
two year member Merle 
Kemble, wants campus activi-
ties and services to focus more 
upon the needs of commuters 
who make up a majority of the 
student bodv. 

urawing from his own 
experience, Carlson pointed out 
that "students who never live 
on campus and remain com-
muters all four years ' are 
always detached." Kemble 
added, "Either you live on

are two social groups and our 
purpose is to narrow the gap." 
Kemble stressed that he 
encourages commuters to get 
fnvorvecr In planning and ' to 
"move into" the various 
organizations, so that the social 
atmosphere represents a 
balance of activities for both 
residents and commuters. 

Commuter pHie book 
Today the board announced 

plans for the publication of a 
campus-wide commuter 
guidebook. Scheduled to be 
completed for the orien~tion of 
next year's incoming students, 
it will feature tips on college 
social Ufe and transportation 
needs. 

Each of the four colleges will 
be invited to submit informa-
tion on campus services for 
commuters. "The objective is 
to compile all the different 
flyers and notices that y.ou see 
around campus into a single 
comprehensive resource that is 
easy to find," noted Dick 
Semerdjian. 

The original idea for the 
handbook came. from com-

. muter students who made the 
request in a survey done last 
year. The topics for the new 
resource guide will be selected 
by commuters through a 
similiar poll taken during the 
winter quarter. 

Something more 
Kemble also outlined several 

of the projects that the board 
will sponsor in the coming year. 
"We want all students to know 
about activities . There Is 

, 

something more than classes, 
the library and out to the 
parking lot. " The approach is to 
bring these events to wherever 
the highest density of Warren 
College commu e . denfs 
congregate. 

Current plans include 
information bulletin boards 
around campus for fast 
communication and faculty 
home visits with professors 
who live in the arne areas as 
commuters. The board also 
pursues such issues as parking 
and transit problems. 

In th.e past the board lias 
arranged for commuter 
student lockers, an exchange 
between dorm student and 
commuters, as well as success-
ful commuter breakfasts. The 
ideas have been limited only by 
the availability of funding. 

When asked what would 
provide the best ultimate 
situation for commuters , 
Carlson said, "I'd like to see a 
dean of commuter students. 
Why can't the commuter 
students have a person who 
represents their needs, just as 
the resident deans work with 
the people who live in the 
dorms?" 

The board meets each, week 
on Thursday at 8 am in 405 
Warren College. These meet-
ings serve as a time for 
information exchange and 
planning for the different 
committees working in various 
commuter areas . The com-
muter board is one of several 
boards which compose the 
Warren College Cabinet.

New Indicator 
controversy 
Is resolved 

I by Eric Jaye 
Staff Writer 

The recent warning from AS 
communications commission-
er Dave Eisen to the New 
Indicator thatit could lose $6300 , 
in funds for not printing full 
names in its staff box was the 
result of a " communications 
breakdown ," according t o 
Eisen, between himself and 
Assistant Vice-chancellor of 
Student Affairs Tom Brown. 

Eisen ' s warning to the 
New Indicator that it should 
print full names or risk losing 
funds came aUer Brown 
requested him to determine 
who was responsible for the 
content of the paper. 

In response to Eisen ' s 
warning the New Indicator 's 
lawyer Robert Lynn sent a 
letter to Brown, a copy of wbich 
Eisen received, stating that the 
names of the four students were 
on file with Student Organiza-
tions. According to Brown, he 
thought those four name s 
sufficient and after learning of 
them decided to let the matter 
drop. However, Brown did not 
inform Eisen or the New 
Indicator of his decision . 

Lost in mail 
EiSen did not learn of 

Brown's decision until it was 
brought to his attention by the 
Triton Times. Eisen expressed 
surprise at Brown's decision 
and said that he had received 
the impression from Brown 
that he wanted all the names of 
those connected with the New 
Indicator either in its staff box 
or on file . 

According to Eisen, Brown 
should have known of the four 
names on file . Brown approves 
all student organizations and 
his signature appears on the 
New Indicator 's registration 
card, which contains the four 
names. 

Eisen said at the time he 
learned of Brown's decision, 
" Unless Tom sent me S(,T.~ 
thing that was lost in the n.:-: l, 
he has not handled · h i .. 
properly. " 

Lack of communicatioL 
As of Monday night there l",aa 

been no further communic" ~!()n 
between Brown and EL~ r 
Eisen had, however, talk"" to 
" other administrators," , 
he declined to name. Acco 
to Eisen these administrator 
" expres ed surprise " that 
Brown had not mentioned the 
situation to them. 

Eisen said Monday night, " I 
continue to be amazed by 
Brown's lack of communica-
tion with me, the AS and the 
New Indicator. "

N ow you have to understand I

Anyway, back to old Carl

my wrath? 

He invented the parking 
meter. 

And after he invented it, back 
in 1935, he had the gall to go out 
and market the thing. At first 
he found the idea difficult to 
sell, but then Oklahoma City, 
Okalhoma, (which, when you 
consider how original its name 
is, doesn't figure to be the 
innovation capital of America, 
agreed to install the newfang-
led meters in Julv 1935. 

Of course they were an ,

cities got revenue . Local 
merchants got quicker turn-I

SpoI1I EdilOr 

UCSD opens up its 1977-78 
Varsity .basketball campaign 
next Friday and once again, 
head coach Barry Cunningham 
has the ghosts of seasons past 
haunting him. 

As has been the case in 
Cunningham's teD year tenure 
at UCSD, be's never had a 
legitimate center to ease the 
reDou'ndlng pressure off his 
forwards. He bas a difficult 
schedule which pits Ilia Tritons 
against nine NCAA Division I 
schools. He bas lneligibillties in 
guard Kevin Douglass (a 
possible starting guard) 
sidelined with scbolastlc 
problema and Brian Keller, a 
6'6" junior transfer from 
Eastern New Mexico State who 
can't play until January 30th 

New JV COlIC. Kill, W ...... 
See .tOlll_ .... 5. 

(an NAIA and NCAA rule states 
a player must sit out eighteen 
weeks before eligibility is 
restored) . Cunningham bas no 
idea of what his starting line-up 
will be just seven days before 
the season debut with LIFE 
College in Los Angeles. And it 
that's not enought to give 
Cunningham second tboughts 
about coaching. highly regard· 
ed Howard Grunloh. looked 
upon as the best all-round 
player on tbe squad, was 
hospitalized Monday with an 
undisclosed ailment and won't 
return until mid December. 

But don't write off the 1977-78 
Tritons, because they ' ve 
managed to overcome "minor" 
problems like these before. 
What Cunningham does have 
going for him is eight returning 
letermen (Lnclu.ding tbree 
starters) and a team "with a 
great attitude and a lot of 
heart." Those two usually go 
band in hand with a successful 
season. 

Game plan 
Since the Tritons have no big 

man under the boards, Cun-
ningham, a disciple of the fast 
break, "won't run like I'd 
planned. The guards will have 
to rebound (an average of six 
rpg, Cunningham says) and 
we'll work instead from steals 
and turnovers." To counteract 
the lack of a set starting five, 
Cunningham plans on "trying 
to make a revolving line-up. 

. Wbo ever is playing well during 
practice or 'in the previous 
game will start. But. I'll have a 
set starting team by January 
8." 

" Our goal is to win fifty 
percent of our non-conference 
games . That 's a realistic 
prediction but it will be 
difficult." Cunningham noted. 
Non-league opponents include 
PCAA member UC Irvine, Far 
West Conference three time 
defending champion UC Davis, 
Westmont. rated 18th in the 
NAIA pre-season poll and,the 
top small college team in 
California. Texas Christian of 
the SWC. Texas Arlington. 
Southern Mississippi and USD. 
"Another goal." contrary to 
what has been an unwritten 
rule in past UCSD basketball 
years, "is not to keep every· 
body happy ..... 

Cunningham will run a 
conservative motion offense. 
working the ball around the 
perimeter. looking for the open 
fifteen to twenty footer or the 
easy layup underneath. "We've 
got some good quick shooters 
and if we stick to the game plan 
and play smart ball (error 
free). we'll be a factor." 

Team dep&h 
With eight returning letter-

men, the Tritons have the depth 
to facilitate Cunningham's 
revolving line-up. Back from 
last season's 4-24 Dick Sa tterlee 
coached squad are forwards 
6'6" junior Lemond Brockett, 
6'4" junior Bob Frazier and

Cox - Excellent quickness. A

Brockett - Everybody looks at

Leape play 
The Tritons begin NAIA 

District Three Southern 
Division play January 20 
hosting Cal Baptist College. 
Cunningham emphasized that 
the lugue will be very 
probably be tougher by the time 
league play starts. Southern 
Califorma College is "supposed 
to have a fine team," while 
Azuza Pacific sports a rront line 
which averages 6'7" and has 
three returning starters. Two-
time defending titlist Cal 
Baptist is in big trouble. Four 
starters (Michael Jackson, . 
Rommie Rogers, Stanley 
Oldham and Clarence Brown) 
were arrested for campus 
burglaries and suspended for 
balanced, but Point Loma will 
most likely capture first place. 
"The Crusaders are very 
strong, big, physical and 
talented." USIU, back under 

the direction of head coach Bob 
Kloppenberg after a one year 
absence. is much weaker than 
in previous season, but will 
probably be tougher by the tlm~ 
league play starts. The Lancers 
will need some big breaks to 
avoid occupyini the Soutbern 
Division basement. 

While Cunningham has (our 
guards with at least one year or 
varsity experience, be's still 
looking ror a playmaker to take 
charge on the court. Bradley, 
Stark, Omalev and Greenstein 
are all fighting for starting

ham will rely on Brockett and 
Grunloh to carry the weight in 
rebounding. 

Tom Polk and Aubrey 
Fenderson of the junior varsity 
are both capable or movlni up 
to the varsity to fill in as 
forwards, but it's in the middle 
where the Tritons hurt the 
most. "We need to recruit two 
big men, about 6'8"," While 
Conyers, thought to be a 
potential starting forward last 
May, has been demoted, "he 
has not been that much of a 
disappointment," CunniDiham 
added. At 6'1", he's got the size 
UCSD needs at center. How-
ever, Conyers has not had 
someone to work with him (he 
has only played basketball for 
two years) . Besides CunaiDl-
ham, only Mallory Mitchell, ex· 
UCSD all District guard, DOW 
assistant coach, has helped out 
with coaching chores. Mitchell 
has, according to Cunningham, . 
done an excellent job, but the 
head coach really would like 
three coaches so all bases can 
be covered and each player can 
receive individualized atten-
tion. 

"We still need to improve our 
passing game and a few other 
fundamentals ," Cunningham 
cpncluded. The Tritons have 
one more week to polish up 
their game and solve their line-
up problems. Hoperully, Barry 
Cunningham will find a plan 
th4t works ... well enough to get 
UCSD into the NAIA playoffs in 
late February.

New head coach . 
Big front line aids JV Tritons 

by Jon Halperin 
S&alf Writer 

The Triton junior varsity 
basktball squad, with a healthy 
squad, a bit luck and the grace 
of varsity coach Barry Cun-
ningham, couldiiterally size up 
to be the best ever at UCSD. 

As of now, the King Wayman 
coached JV cagers boast an 
impressive front line or 6'8", 
6'6" and 6'5" with few or Its 
scheduled opponents matcbing 
those figures. However, two or 
the big men (6'8" Brad Conyers 
and 6'6" Mark Runyan) could 
be brought up to the varsity at 
any time, resulting in Way-
man's fate balancing on the 

needs or Cunningham. 
Openini their season Nov. 29 

against Cal State Northridge at 
home, the status of the JV 
squad will become stable by the 
first week or December . 
Composed of almost entirely 
new faces, the Jayvees have 
only Tom Polk, Todd Gabreli-
cic and Paul Gardener return-
ing from last season's 10-13 
team. 

THE FRONT LINE: Rio 
Hondo JC transfer Conyers, 
Runyan. with both Gardener 
and Polk at 6'5" and rreshmen 
Kevin Houp and AI Jacobs 
comprise what appears to be a 
strong front line in 1977-78 for 

the Trjtonites. Conyers has 
shown marked improvem ' t 
during each practice since he 
has begun working with players 
on his ability level. Runyan, 
who was sent down by Cunning-
ham (rom the Varsity to "brush 
up on his fundamentals and 
improve his attitude, " could be 
the key to a successful season. 
The 200 pound sophomore (rom 
EI Camino Real High School in 
Woodland Hills started several 
games (or the Varsity at center, 
where he proved he can score 
and rebound when he wants to. 
Polk and Gardener will be key 
performers if tbey stay 
healthy. Polk 's knees are 
suspect while Gardener won't 
be able to join the team until 
after final exams in the second 
week of December. 

Wayman cited the impres-
sive play or Houp and Jacobs 
and expects them to get plenty 
of playing time as the season 
progresses.

FRONTIERS of SCIENCE 12 
"METAPHYSICS II" 

Has technology ameliorated the human condition or has it 
dehumanized us, alienated us, and frustrated our freedoms? Is 
science really a progressive social force? To answer these and 
other questions, we must ask deeper ones which are at the basis 
of our philosophy, our religion and our ethics. We will probe 
these questions from an interdisciplinary viewpoint in order to 

n a fuller insight into the interconnectedness of knowledge 
the role of humankind in the Universe.

In the first Trot in 1989, only 

fifteen runners competed, but 
Johnson noted that over 70 
persons have signed up lor 
tomolTOw morning's event and 
another 25 to 30 are expected to 
relister at race time. Prizes 
will again be awarded on the 
basis of accuracy in 1U8uin1 
time, a practice Johnson 
explained, "implemented for 
two reasons. First, it 
encourages everyone to 
compete, but most important-
ly it gives everyone an equal 
chance or at least as lood as 
chance as anyone else. So, we 
give the best prizes to these 
people." ' 

AlthOUlh every runner will 
start at the same time (on the 
middle of the Muir Field), 
times will be broken down into 
three categories: one for the · 
average student, one lor 
members of the cross country 
and track team (as well as 
those with previous colle ,e 
runninl experience) and a 
Masters Division lor thoIIe over 
30 years old. 

In last year's race, Muir 
senior Barry Carlton guessed 
his time to the exact second and 
won a 18 pound turkey. Nine 
others in the 1976 event came 
within 31 seconds ol tbeir 
predicted times. Gary Nitti, ex-
UCLA distance runner wbo's 
now a grad stude.nt at UCSD, 
will attempt to delend bis title 
while 1975 winner Larry Woolf 
(also fifth ip 1976) will aiao run.

THE BACKCOURT: Gabre-

licic and late varsity cut Rob 
Graham figure to start at the 
guard positions. The sixth man 
on last year's team, Gabrelicic 
is competent at runninr the 
lastbreak style of offense 
employed by Wayman. Gra-
ham is a polished performer 
with a good jump shot. He'll be 
tbe man used to break up 
oppoainl team's zone defenses . 

Wayman has been relatively 
disappointed with the prolress 
of his otherbackcourt bopefuls 
and will be looking ... and hoping 
for Improvement during the 
season. 

HigbUlhtiDl the Tritonites 
eigbteen game schedule .lae is 
the annual UCSD-UCLA 
conlrontation at Pauley 
Pavilion in Westwood. The 
lame' preceeds the UCLA-
Washinlton Varsity contest 
and will be the UCSD players' 
opportunity to play before a 
10,000 plus crowd. 

Other bilgames on the 
scbedule include USC at the LA 
Sports Arena, Feb. 2, Long 
Beach State, Jan. 17 and USD, 
Feb. 10. As the team looks now, 
the Tritonites stack up well 
a,ainst their better opponents 
o 1977-78. 

The JVs have the cbance to 
win as many as 15 of their 18 
games and a relatively weak 
first lour games gives them the 
chance to get off to a last start. 
Wayman looks to his big men 
and hopes tbat Conyers , 
Runyan and Polk wiD stay on 
the JV. u 10Di a.s pouible. 

"Life" talk 
(ConliDued from..,e 1) 

ning what came first?" 
Bullard elucidated about the 

possibility ')f DNA originating 
first, while Crick ademantly 
supported the idea of protein 
coming first. As to the ultimate 
answr, Cri "!k said, "This is a 
question we have to wait I'Ifter 
fifty years and see if it looks as 
difficult as it does now. Before 
L956 replication looked diffi-
cult. " Now," he said with 
smilt., "it looks rather easy." 

The panelists themselves 
asked questions of one another,_ 
evidenced by Bullard asking 
Crick, "Are there other kinds of 
living systems elsewhere? " 
Crick said there were "prob-
ably" other living systems in 
the universe, but pointed out 
that they must lulfill two 
reqi¥rements, those being 
replication and molecules that 

. can form combinations by 
.stringlng themselves to-
gether."

Telephone ... 
(Continued lrom page Z) 

Ottesen won't get complaints 
about them; and the profit on 
them is enough t.o cover 
commissions, phone bills and 
expenses, and perhaps turn a 
very modest profit for Allied 
International : But the real 
purpose of the phone campaign 
is to discover those Mr . 
Ottesens who will .accept the 
digital clock at a home address . 
They are the ones who will , 
within the next few weeks, be 
getting another telephone call 
from the central office of Allied 
International in Los Angeles, 
from a high·powered and very 
skil lful telephone salesman, 
who will offer Allied's full line 
of office supplies, from 
typewriter ribbon!> to pencil 
sharpeners. For an order of a 
few thousand dollars, the free 
gift, "just as a favor for doing 
business with Allied," is not 
merely a clock, but a SONY 
table-model color TV, deliv-
ered to Mr. Ottesen's home , of 
course. For the next order -
well, there's a ten-day " custo-
me rs ' convention" in the 
Bahamas coming up in Novem-
ber. 

Allied's products are prob-
ably no worse, and no better, 
than those available from 
dozens of other dealers. Allied's 
prices may be a little higher,

Meters ... 
(eo.dllaed fnm .-.e 1) 

upWardl. first to a nickel, then 
a dime. More reeendy the little 
sliver monsters bave been 
programmed to accept quart-
ers. In some urban area. it is 
possible to drop two quarters 
into a meter before the th!q 
will withdraw that .ilIy red 
"expired" disk and actually 
give you some parking time. 
Now for 50 cents the damn tbing 
sbould at least sbine your 
shoe., or wbistle a tune or do an 
imitation of R2D2 from Star 
Wars. 

But parking meters do 
absolutely nothing. Except run 
down too Quickly . 

Today's 'parkiq meters are 
pretty sophisticated, I must 
admit. After all, it takes a fairly 
advAn,.,.d technology to 
produce a piece of equipment 
that can sense. with unerring 

accuracy, exactly which 
deoomiDatiODl of chaqe' you 
are out of before you pull 
into tile space. 

ADd bave you ever tried to get 
chaqe for a meter? The local 
merchants know a good thiq 
when they see one and put up 
little sipl telliq you that you 
mUll make a purchase before 
they'll make change. Now I 
don't mind Spendilll a little 
money to secure a spot for my 
car, but I draw the line at 
havinl to purchale a 21-inch 
c:olor television simply to get a 
dime for the meter. I still don't 
believe the illY didn't have a 
black-and-white somewhere in 
the back. 

A friend of miDe has his own 
th~7n::OOt parking meten-he they're jutt the first 
step in the introduction of the 
metric system. 

"Everybody knows they 
should be called parking 
yards," he reasons.

AIlIDeIdea' 
The real reason I hate 

parking meters goes back to a 
little incident that took place 
back in 1967. 

It waa summertime. A group 
of us were standing around 
sbooting the breeze in a 
downtown square. I was 
leaom. on a parking meter and 
noticed it wasn't too securely 
affixed to the pavement below. 
Well. as best al I can .remem-
ber, before.1 knew it the meter 
. had leaped out of ita hole and 
was going for my tbroat. 
There"s notbing quite as 
frightening as a crazed meter 
intent on physical violence. 

Naturally, I felt compelled to 
wrestle the offendinJ metal 
object to the ground. trnfortun-
ately, just as I did so a man in 
blue appeared and arrested 
me. 

I was charged with malicious 
damage to public property an 
attempted meter molesting. 

To make a long story short, r 
beat the rap on a technicality. It 
turns out meters make lousy 
witnesses: and the policeman 
had forgotten to inform me of 
my rights . 

But ever since that incident 
I've hated parking meters and 
all they stand for. 

Carl Mcgee is dead - hIS 
time ran out, I guess you might 
say. But his legacy lives on, 
with row upon row of parking 
meters dotting the landsca~.
