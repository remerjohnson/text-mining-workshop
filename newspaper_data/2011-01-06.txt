Concerns about UCSDs out-of-date technology have spurred a 
proposed $5-per-unit quarterly technology fee that, if passed, would 
go into e�ect Fall Quarter 2010. �e fee, capped at 16 units, would 
cost up to $80 per quarter for the maintenance of technology such as 
campus WiFi networks, computer labs and projectors.   

� e fee was proposed by Director of Academic Computing and 
Media Services Je� Henry at the last A.S. Council meeting of Fall 
Quarter 2010.   

Currently, the majority of campus technology is funded by a 
start-up grant that gave no room for the cost of future maintenance. 

According to Henry,  the fee would keep UCSD technology up-
to-date and on par with improvements seen at other campuses. Im-
provements would include a better WiFi network, remote access to 
computer labs and higher resolution projectors. 

 UCSD is falling behind, Director of ACMS Christine Bagwell 
said. Our instructional technology environment is not on par with 
even that o�ered at neighboring institutions, such as SDSU. 

Unlike many campuses, UCSD does not provide blanket WiFi ac-
cess, as it experiences networking problems at some locations, such 
as the Tioga dorm building in Muir College, where free wireless ac-
cess is not o�ered.

A.S. Associate Vice President of College A�airs Leonard Bobbit 
raised similar concerns about UCSDs lagging technology services.  

 UCSD does not have a technology fee, making it economically 
infeasible to keep up with all this new tech, Bobbit said. �ere is 
also no money to maintain technologies such as WebCT or even our 
WiFi system. UCSD is now in a situation where our current technol-

ogy is outdated and falling apart.  
Bagwell said all undergraduates would bene�t from improved 

technology.   
 �e fee covers items that a�ect every undergraduate student, 

Bagwell said. [Like], the wireless network in classrooms and places 
where students congregate has no funding source currently. I am a 

recent graduate myself and I can remem-
ber many times when I couldnt connect 
to the wireless network in a lecture hall 
to view handouts on my instructors web-
site because the network access point was 
overloaded.  

Bobbit said he is unsure of how much 
money is needed to close the technology 
gap, stating that the $5-per-unit fee may 
be an overestimate.   

 �e budget is based on what [Senior 
Vice Chancellor of Academic A�airss of-
�ce] believed they needed, Bobbit said. I 
can honestly tell you that the price is over-
in�ated. By how much, Im not sure. Im 
not really sure how they came up with the 
idea that students need to pay per unit, or 
why it is being capped at 16 units, or why 

it is going to be so high. If I had to take a guess, they are doing it this 
way because $5 per unit per quarter sounds a lot better than $80 
per quarter. 

But ACMS and the SVCAA drew up a budget stating otherwise.

$80 QUARTERLY TECH FEE

Last quarter, the literature, earth sciences and 
mathematics departments changed their major 
requirements effective immediately. In addition, 
graduate departments have added new degrees in 
the physics, structural engineering, mathematics and 
mechanical and aerospace engineering majors.

For incoming freshmen, the literature department 
now requires an English literature sequence for its 
writing, Spanish and cultural studies concentrations. 
Previously, a variety of lower-division sequences 
including film classes and Third World Studies 
classes  substituted the requisite. 

According to Undergraduate Literature Adviser 
Joe Spano, the literature department felt the new 
course would provide more valuable skills compared 
to the previous applicable courses.

 [The department] really wanted students to 
take a valuable class, Spano said. The American 
Survey [LTEN 26] samples writing they wanted 
students to have.

In addition, Literatures in Spanish majors can 
now replace 130A/B (Development of Spanish 
Literature and American Literature, respectively) 
while the Literature of Cultural Studies major allows 
a wider range of electives to cover requirements. 

The  earth sciences major, part of the 
environmental systems program at Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography, will expand in response 
to the Undergraduate Academic Advising Task 
Force. Previously, the earth science major was split 
into three specializations: geochemistry, geophysics 
and geology. Now, no specialization is required. 

Associate Director of Environmental Systems 
Jane Teranes proposed the changes last year, saying 
that less requirements will give students flexibility to 
shape their majors.

The Mathematics Department added the 140A/B 
or 142A/B analysis sequences as a new requirement.

This was added to give additional mathematic 
rigor to the major and to give students a more 
cohesive structure to follow, Undergraduate 
Program Officer Scott Rollans said.  

In addition, the mathematics department also 
changed the following majors from a Bachelor of Arts 
to Bachelor of Science degrees: mathematics, applied

Instead of opening an A.S. -sponsored apparel store in Price 
Center East this spring, council has decided to launch a mobile 
tent store. 

According to Associate Vice President of Enterprise 
Operations Brian McEuen, the plans were changed due to an 
estimated $98,000 in upstart costs that covered design, construc-
tion, rent and inventory,. Instead, organizers shelved the idea to 
save $80,800 with a $16,200 mobile store, which includes the 
costs of merchandising equipment, tents, inventory and rent.

We had sticker shock when we realized how much it 

would cost, and so we came up with the idea to go mobile, 
McEuen said.

Because the scale will be so much smaller in a mobile 
store, the costs are far less. In addition, construction costs 
for a physical store in Price Center would cost about 
$50,000, while the tent required for a mobile store costs 
$3,000, thereby saving $47,000 in construction costs. 

Vice President of Finance and Resources Andrew Ang 
said the mobile option was beneficial for reasons other than 
cutting cost, since the council had already allocated $204,000 
in Spring Quarter 2010 to fund the venue. 

We do have the money, but that doesnt mean we have 
to spend it all, Ang said. And to be financially minded, we 

decided to just use what we need to be successful.
Ang said that, with a mobile store, the council can obtain 

live data on the popularity of Triton Outfitters without pay-
ing expensive rent. Two surveys were conducted last year to

New Supercomputer Can Estimate Earthquake Damage 
SCIENCEÊANDÊTECHNOLOGY

By Varun Chaturvedi
Contributing Writer

UCSD’s San Diego Supercomputer 
Center is one of the first in the world 
to run a supercomputer flash memory-
based storage system. The computer, 
named Gordon, is a means of pro-
viding researchers an efficient way to 
sift through massive pools of data and 
obtain models.

Gordon’s installment later this year 
will help researchers with various proj-
ects, ranging from protein structures’ 
role in blood clots to helping predict 
the impact of earthquakes. 

For example, Southern California 
Earthquake Center geophysicists use 
large amounts of data to create mod-
els to predict earthquakes’ impact on 
buildings near fault lines. Gordon can 
create models by speeding up calcula-
tions using data within its expansive 
memory and high computing power.

“We are excited about the potential 
of Gordon,” SDSC Interim Director 
Michael Norman said. 

“This High Performance 
Computing system will allow research-
ers to solve critical data-intensive prob-
lems from analysis of genomes for cre-
ation of patented drugs, to modeling 
forecasts for earthquakes.”

SDSC was awarded a five-year $25 
million grant to investigate a wide 
range of data-intensive science — such 
as astronomy and Earth science — to 
provide cost-effective data analysis per-
formance, a process equivalent to more 
than 10 times the efficiency of super-
computers around the world.

When configured, Gordon will fea-
ture 245 teraflops of total computing 
power (one teraflop is a trillion calcula-
tions per second), 64 terabytes of digital 
random access memory and four pet-
abytes of disk storage.

“With the flash memory tech-
nology used to reduce latency times 
in calculations, Gordon should rank 
among the top 25 supercomput-
ers in the world,” Communications  
Representative SDSC Warren Froelich 
said. “I like to think of it as the ‘world’s 

largest thumb drive,’ except it actually 
computes data.”

Researchers have had significant 
trouble sifting through large storage of 
data. They wanted a cost-effective that 
was fast in processing information and 
calculating solutions.

“Gordon builds on technology now 
being deployed at the SDSC, including 
the new Triton Resource and Dash HPC 
systems,” Norman said. “These systems 
leverage lightning-fast memory tech-
nology already used from the normal 
digital cameras, thumb drives and lap-
top computers.”

Gordon features closely resemble 
those of Dash. In 2009, a SDSC research 
team won the Storage Challenge 
competition at the Supercomputing 
Conference, an international confer-
ence on high-performance computing.

The team considered the changes 
made to Dash and showcased the pro-
totype at the competition.

“The SC09 Storage Challenge 
provided tremendous results for us,” 
Froelich said. “Presenting the architec-

ture of Dash to the conference allowed us 
to perfect the system to create Gordon.”

The excitement for Norman and 
Froelich, however, was not from the 
system itself, but its legacy.

“The application for Gordon and 
the amount of assistance it will pro-
vide for scientists and researchers is 
profound,” Froelich said. “Numerous 
amounts of projects have popped up 
with the news of Gordon.”

Based on the annual budget and the 
fees enacted at other UC schools, in 
order to maintain and improve UCSD 
technology, a $4 million annual budget 
with $1.1 million investment is neces-
sary.   

�is fee proposal was dra�ed over 
the summer and submitted to council 
at the beginning of Fall Quarter. 

Currently, a team of ACMS employ-
ees are working on incorporating feed-
back from A.S. Council into the pro-
posal. Bobbit said the council believes 

the $5 rate is too high. 
If the fee passes with Chancellor 

Marye Anne Fox’s approval, it will be 
UCSD’s �rst per-unit fee. Currently, 
student fees are charged per student 
or are calculated based on whether the 
student is full-time or part-time.  

�ough Bagwell said the fee was 
necessary to improve education quality, 
Bobbit said it is in�ated and wasteful. 

“Many of the proposed technolo-
gies are not even necessary — things 
such as universal laptop chargers in the 
library, remote access to computer labs, 

and higher resolution projectors — 
they would all make our lives easier but 
do we really need all of this if it means 
some students not receiving an educa-
tion?”  he said.

During Week �ree, �e �nal pro-
posal will go to the Course Materials 
and Services Fee Committee, during 
Week �ree. �e committee will pro-
vide details to Fox, who will make the 
�nal decision.

ascertain the potential popularity of 
the store, but according to McEuen, the 
questions were not targeted enough to 
return usable data. 

McEuen said a mobile store allows 
Triton Outfitters to create a market for 
itself and that the mobile nature will 
enable it to follow potential custom-
ers to popular events, such as the Sun 
God Festival, vendor fairs and farmers’ 
markets. 

If Triton Outfitters gains enough 
student support, the council will look 
into expanding to Price Center, he said.

McEuen presented a projected time-
line for the physical expansion at the 

Dec. 1 council meeting. The first step 
will be establishing the enterprise and 
branding Triton Outfitters through the 
mobile store over the next two years. 

The next step is to develop a website 
and, in four to five years, if students 
respond positively, the council will 
reopen the possibility a physical store.

“We want to make sure it’s a popular 
commodity first,” McEuen said. “If we 
see success, we will build the personnel 
infrastructure by hiring product devel-
opers and managers and then we would 
look at spaces in Price Center.”

The space reserved by University 
Centers for the store will be used for 
another vendor at the discretion of 

University Centers. If the council 
expands into a physical store later, it 
will renegotiate with University Centers 
to find an available space. 

McEuen hopes that by offering stu-
dents goods that are not available else-
where on campus, Triton Outfitters will 
build a solid customer base that will 
lead to expansion. 

“The bookstore sells core university 
items,” McEuen said. “We are selling 
the extra stuff for concerts and events. 
We plan on having Triton Outfitters 
build its own brand of clothing.”

Last night was the first A.S. meeting of the quarter and the first A.S. meeting 
I have ever attended.  Despite 
being warned that meetings end at 
ungodly hours, I was shocked to be 
in an out in around an hour. 

AVP Athletics 
Pauline Nuth 
announced 
the council is 
organizing a 
community-
building event 
to improve 
relationships with athletes. She 
informed members of the Triton 
Jam rally on Jan. 11 and also of  
Spirit Night, which will occur on 
Feb. 5 for the men’s and women’s 
basketball games.

VP Student Life Kristina Pham 
said the lineup for the Winter 
Triton Festival comedy event on 
Feb. 5 (W.T.F.) will be announced at 
the end of this week. 

Campuswide Senator Victor 
Flores-Osorio shared concerns 
the Course Materials and Fees 
Committee had with new 
regulations on course material fees 
presented by UC President Mark G. 
Yudof. These included confusion 
over tricky wording in the 
regulations and how course material 
fees affect financial aid.

Warren College President Alyssa 
Wing introduced the freshman 
senators appointed last quarter.

All-Campus Transfer 
Association Chair Adam Powers 
ended his two-year term as transfer 
senator; Samer Naji and Jacob 
Wisdom succeeded him. The two 
were appointed during closed 
session, when councilmembers 
debated when to appoint the new 
transfer senators.

Wing gave an update on 

the College Council Funding 
Committee looking into a 1985 
referendum, which gave funding 
to college councils on a per-
student basis. In a meeting today 
with an A.S. veteran from 1985 
who witnessed the passing of 

referendum, 
Wing hopes 
to find some 
answers.

Campuswide 
Senator 
Elizabeth Elman 
gave a video 

presentation on how electronic 
consumption habits — specifically, 
the use of unsustainable electronics 
that have an 18-month life — in the 
United States affect the rest of the 
world. 

Several councilmembers 
chimed in during the presentation 
and suggested websites with 
more information on the issue. 
It was a welcome surprise to see 
councilmembers aware of and 
involved in environmental issues.

AVP Academic Affairs Desiree 
Prevo said the CP committee did 
not approve of the technology fee 
proposed last quarter because the 
costs were too high.

Campuswide Senator Michael 
Raimondi said there will be a Greek 
Housing Initiative Committee 
meeting during Week Three. Before 
then, he will meet with college 
councils and deans.

Powers brought up the issue of 
councilmember accountability in 
meeting deadlines. 

This week’s meeting was fairly 
tame, though I’ve heard that’s not 
always the case. I walked out of the 
meeting surprised by its briefness 
(meetings for Sixth College Council 
run longer than last night’s), but 
happy to be out all the same.

Yes.
Flops to Apple for failing to correct the second alarm clock 
glitch in the past two months, causing two days of alarm 

failures for iPhone users around the world.

Props to Massachusetts Lt. Gov. Timothy Murray for pulling two 
children out of a burning minivan after calling 911 on Jan. 4.

It’s 4 a.m, the night before your first class. You’ve been tossing and turning for five hours. If 
you fall asleep now, you will have 
five hours of sleep. Four hours. 
Three. 

Envying your peacefully slumber-
ing roommate, you begin to fantasize 
about the barrier between reality and 
the dream world and the ending of 
Inception. Briefly consider whether 
you are going insane, but realize you 
just have insomnia. It still sucks. 

The science of sleep, we’re told, 
is not actually just a weird French 
movie favored in the freshman 
dorms. There have been entire vol-
umes written on the topic, which 
claim that caffeine addiction is not, 
surprisingly, the sole culprit. Here, 
for your 5 a.m. benefit, a few of 
How-to Guru’s personally tested 
tips. 

The first step is to understand 
why you aren’t sleeping. Insomnia 
can often be triggered by things like 
stress, trauma and Adderall, but 
regardless of the trigger, once the 
fear of not sleeping gets a hold of 
you, it’s hard to shake.

A common, reliable solution for 
insomnia is drug use. There are a 
wide array of drugs for every type 
of sleep-related problem, from night 
terrors to depression to sleepwalk-
ing. The best known, thanks mostly 
to Nick at Nite airtime, are Lunesta, 
Sonata and Rozerem. 

If you count yourself among the 
one in eight college students still 
wary of prescription drug addiction, 
though, another natural remedy 
is Melatonin. Commonly used by 
jetlagged travelers, Melatonin is a 
lightweight drug that can pack a 
pretty heavy punch. You can pick 
it up over the counter at your local 
CVS or Ralphs.

Try making little changes in your 
sleeping environment by making 
sure you sleep in a cool, dark room 
on a good mattress in loose clothes. 
Dr. Oz claims this helps more than 
half of all insomniacs. 

But if sleeplessness has become a 
problem for weeks on end, another 
tip is exercise. Thirty minutes a day 
of continuous exercise is highly 
effective in combating insomnia. 
Whether it’s running on a treadmill 
in RIMAC or doing sit-ups in your 
room, make sure to exercise at least 
four hours before bed. (Adrenaline 
and sleep don’t mix.)  

It’s always hard to readjust your 
circadian rhythm after weeks of liv-
ing the nocturnal life. Obviously, 
you want a normal sleeping sched-
ule during the quarter, when you 
probably are expected to rise before 
sunset. 

Though it’s important to return 
your body clock back to normal, 
don’t try to rush the process — it’s 
best to take a nap when you feel 
most exhausted and ease back into a 
more socially accepted schedule.

And if your condition really gets 
to be too much to handle, schedule 
an appointment with the Student 
Health Services or Counseling and 
Psychological Services. (Or maybe 
just try the warm milk thing. Works 
for us.)

It’s not often that this board grants UC President Mark G. Yudof or the Board of Regents 
a pat on the back, but we guess 
there’s a first time for everything. 

While most of us were in finals 
hibernation mode during the week 
of Dec. 9, a group of 36 high-rank-
ing UC administrators (including 
five from UCSD) co-signed a letter 
to Yudof demanding higher pen-
sions — and threatening to sue if 
those demands weren’t met. 

Though the final decision is 
expected to be made at a Regents’ 
meeting later this month, Yudof 
and Regents’ Chairman Russell 
Gould publicly condemned those 
seeking additional post-retirement 
income on Tuesday. 

The letter cites a 1999 agree-
ment that the Regents’ would base 
high-income employees’ pension 
on a percentage of their income 

rather than on the $245,000 feder-
ally-mandated cap in the event that 
the limit was ever raised. That limit 
was eliminated four years ago. 

Not only does the letter 
— obtained in full by the San 
Francisco Chronicle last week — 
threaten legal action, it also warns 
of a familiar danger: the loss of the 
talented, invaluable administrators 
themselves, and the deterioration 
of the UC system in their threat-
ened absence. 

The university, they argue, has a 
“legal, moral and ethical obligation” 
to cater to their 1999 request.

It should go without saying 
that things have changed a good 
deal at the university since then. 
Student fees, for one, have tripled 
in cost from $3,429 to $11, 124. 
Enrollment has skyrocketed, state 
funding plummeted. 

Yet the list of administrators 

who have co-signed — which 
includes Vice Chancellor for 
Resource Management Gary 
Matthews and Rady School of 
Management Dean Robert Sullivan 
— appear to need reminding of the 
shifting times. 

For one, the UC system already 
faces a $21.6-billion employee pen-
sion deficit, which the Regents’ 
moved to limit last month by 
reducing health care coverage and 
raising the minimum retirement 
age from 50 to 55. This change 
applies to all UC employees, the 
vast majority of whom make far 
less than the $245,000 minimum of 
those who signed the letter. 

Then there’s the issue of stu-
dent fees. Undergraduate tuition 
is due to rise an additional 8 per-
cent this fall, which will put even 

A year has passed since A.S. Council first discussed the possibility of opening a 
campus store selling Sun God attire 
and club apparel. 

Since then, the council has 
thrown $204,000 at the venue, 
picked a location in Price Center, 
named the store Triton Outfitters, 
delayed the project launch count-
less times and — at the 
end of Fall Quarter — 
made one of its finest 
business decisions. 

Faced with the idea of 
spending the fiscal equiv-
alent of 20 UC educations 
on a place to buy sweat-
shirts, Vice President of 
Finance and Resources 
Andrew Ang and 
Associate Vice President 
of Student Enterprises 
Operations Brian McEuen 
have decided to forgo the 
rent space and take the 
store mobile. 

Not iPhone mobile, 
mind you. Instead, Triton 
Outfitters will now be 

housed in a roving tent that, as 
Ang said, will move to wherever 
students are interested. 

As amusing as the concept of a 
mobile tent is, it removes the rent 
consideration, making the project 
a significantly more manageable 
than the original brick-and-mortar 
idea, and increasing the probability 
that it will be launched within our 

lifetimes. 
Triton Outfitters’ track record 

hasn’t been good: First proposed in 
Fall 2009, councilmembers hoped 
it would open in Winter 2010. 
Then Spring 2010. Then Fall 2010. 
Then Spring 2011. 

Given the obstacles to launch-
ing the project, and the projected 
price — a whooping $98,000 of our 

student fees —  it’s noth-
ing but good news that the 
sticker shock has encour-
aged McEuen to scale back 
until the store builds a 
strong student base. 

At $16, 200, the pro-
jected new cost saves the 
council nearly $80,000 in 
student fees, a practical 
move when  no one needs 
to be reminded about 
tuition increases and each 
Regents’ meeting brings 
another Day of Action.

But even with the sav-
ings, the money spent is 
still $16,200 that could go 
directly back to the stu-
dents instead of funding a 

roving store that’s unlikely to find a 
niche market. 

Triton Outfitters can sell Sun 
God apparel, but there’s no need for 
Sun God shorts year-round when 
they can be bought the spring of. 
UCSD attire is available in the book-
store; sororities, fraternities and stu-
dent orgs already order merchandise 
directly themselves,  without losing 
a share of the profit to a bureaucratic 
middleman.

If Triton Outfitters stays, mobile 
format or not, it will likely either 
go the way of the A.S. Graphic 
Studio or the Grove. 

The former began as an A.S. 
enterprise, but quickly became 
a service meant to help students 
without hope of reaping profit. The 
latter leeched money out of coun-
cil’s student-fee purse for years 
before being closed down, after 24 
years, last Spring Quarter. 

Kudos to McEuen and Ang for 
taking the first step. Now they just 
need to take it one step further and 
funnel that remaining $16,200 back 
to the students for services they 
really want.

Dear Editor,
The tragic death of former 

UCSD Filipino Heritage Language 
instructor, Henry Acejo, received 
numerous national and interna-
tional coverage. 

Yet, the UCSD administration 
and Linguistics Department has 
not issued any official statement, 
student body email, or sent a mes-
sage of condolence to the Acejo 
family and friends. 

Furthermore, the student-run 
newspaper, the Guardian, has not 
made any mention of this event.

Despite the widespread news, 
let me share to you that Henry 
Acejo tragically passed away on 
Dec. 18., 2010. 

Once again, it is my feeling that 
UCSD, as an institution, has fur-
ther isolated itself from the greater 
San Diego community.   

Even with this news of your 
own, UCSD has been silent. No 
excuses. 

As a UCSD Alumnus, I find 
this deeply disheartening and 

upsetting.  
I have written this on behalf of 

the friends and family of Henry 
Acejo. 

Contact information of fam-
ily and friends can be found

JOAN OF ART By Raechel Wong

There’s No Sympathy for the High and Mighty
more pressure on the middle-class 
families hardest 
hit by last Fall 
Quarter’s 32-per-
cent increase. And 
recently inaugurat-
ed governor Jerry 
Brown has already 
promised a decline 
in state funding for 
higher education, 
which will almost 
certainly mean 
further tuition increases during his 
four-year term.

The moral of this whole debacle? 

It’s hardly a surprise: Our highest-
paid executives are hopelessly out of 

touch. 
Sure, the letter 

vaguely alludes to 
“current political 
sensitivities” (i.e., 
a 200,000-strong 
contingent of 
pissed-off students 
unwilling to pay 
more for a deterio-
rating education). 
But it dismisses 

those sensitivities in light of the 
greater crime at stake here: The 
prospect of the co-signing employees 

only making $184,000 a year after 
retirement.

Call us insensitive, we’re not par-
ticularly sympathetic to their cause. 

The fact that the UC’s pension 
system is already running a deficit 
larger than this year’s system-wide 
budget would be reason enough to 
oppose the extra padding. But to 
meet the letter’s demands would also 
cost an estimated $90 million over 
the course of several years, when 
decreased funding and higher tuition 
are all but a sure thing. 

All this, for about 200 of the 
university’s highest-paid employees? 
Beter luck next decade.

J ames Franco is hard to figure out. He plays a lazy stoner in flicks like “Pineapple Express,” but 
uses his downtime to work toward 
various graduate degrees. He’s posed 
in drag for Candy Magazine and 
convincingly portrayed Harvey 
Milk’s lover, but has a girlfriend of 
six years. He loves the Twilight books 
— requested (and was refused) a role 
in the films — and isn’t a 14-year-
old girl. On “General Hospital” last 
summer, Franco played an artist that 

took his craft so seriously he killed 
people for it. Fittingly, the charac-
ter’s name is “Franco.” And with the 
recent release of Oscar-contender 
“127 Hours,” James Franco’s confus-
ing behavior has been grabbing even 
more headlines. 

Back in September 2010, in 
an interview with the Hollywood 
Reporter, Franco said that he mastur-
bates up to four or five times a day. 
Firstly, what kind of workaholic has 
that much fucking time? Secondly, 
the interview about his self-pleasure 
habits coincided with the release of 
“127 Hours” — a movie revolving 
around self-mutilation.  Once again, 
the actor is making strides to avoid 
public definition.

THE BEST 
ALBUMS 
OF 2010
By Arielle Sallai • Hiatus Editor

ALBUM OF 
THE YEAR

YEARINREVIEW

MY BEAUTIFUL DARK TWISTED FANTASY
KANYE WEST

OK, let’s be honest — this one wasn’t even close. Kanye West’s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is indisputably the album of the year, no matter how much you actually enjoyed it. 
Whichever side of Kanye’s peculiar persona is leading the way 

— the dick-swinging brat or the self-loathing loner — mainstream 
hip-hop has never been this ambitious, with sounds as messy and 
contradictory as Yeezy’s own life. 

Maybe Kanye is the savant or the idiot that many claim he is, 
or maybe he’s just a guy who really loves music and isn’t afraid to 
put it together in way that may surprise you. Kanye’s like the pre-
cocious little brother of hip-hop: hopelessly self-centered but still 
naturally gifted. 

Public personas aside, Kanye’s work on Twisted Fantasy is 
packed with more ideas than the game has ever seen. A King 
Crimson sample gets mutilated and bordered by wailing African 
queens on the exhilaratingly bombastic “Power”; a lone piano 
begins “Runaway,” only to turn into a bizarrely distorted vocal 
breakdown by the end of its nine disorienting minutes; album 
closer “Lost In the World” uses Bon Iver’s “Woods” as a bare back-
drop in a moment of self loathing, building to a crescendo of auto-
tuned voices and a Gil Scott Heron sample, asking us and asking 
us, “Who will survive in America?” 

Better rapping has certainly been done this year (see: Big Boi, 
Nicki Minaj), but hell, this isn’t even hip-hop at all. It’s indescrib-
able. I guess that makes it brilliant pop.

M usic is a deeply personal choice, especially with the massive amount of options we are offered today. Were the list to consist entirely of my own preferences, it 
would be a very one-sided window to the musical landscape 
of 2010, including bands like The Radio Dept. and The 
Fresh & Onlys, who I played to death on my iPod but didn’t 
make much impact outside of my own bedroom. 

This list is then a reflection of the records I read about 
the most, the artists I’d argue about with my friends and 

the songs I’d have playing on a loop. Many of these albums 
are not my favorites, but all are culturally important. If we 
threw them in a time capsule to define this time, we’d see an 
ever-changing, fast-paced world in which even your genre 
staples are getting turned completely upside down (see 
the hip-hop visionaries from this year: Kanye West, Flying 
Lotus and Big Boi). These are records that are ambitious 
and innovative. So take a gander — it’s an incredible time to 
be listening. 

Critics like to throw out words like “sprawling” and “ambitious” when describing The 
Suburbs. But those adjectives are so cerebral that they lose sight of the essence of Arcade 
Fire: Frontman Win Butler and co. are tight, consistent and relatable in a very traditional 
sense. Unlike peers who favor hipster trends over old school rock ‘n roll anthems, there’s 
no irony here— every note, every lyric was created with deep sincerity, whether you find 
the music to be groundbreaking or not. 

Refreshingly enough, Arcade Fire are stadium-ready when so many artists are hid-
ing behind MacBooks in their bedrooms, and that’s what makes The Suburbs such an 

accomplishment. Sure, the garage-rock riposte of “Month of May,” the singalong chorus of “Rococo” and the 
Blondie-esque disco of “Sprawl II” help, but its the sincerity of these songs that makes The Suburbs a modern 
rock essential.

Teen Dream is the sound of a band coming of age. Let’s call it their quinceañera, their 
sweet sixteen or, more aptly, their graduation from moody pseudo-shoegazers to a dream-
pop duo. 

With Alex Scally’s layers of reverberating slide guitars and Victoria Legrand’s dark and 
dusty vocals, the band still relies on atmosphere — a night drive on the highway, a walk 
through the park — but with the addition of resounding, heart-wrenching choruses, the 
dark ambiance at the core of Teen Dream is transformed into concrete, satisfying songs. 
Tracks like “Zebra” and “10 Mile Stereo” carry you to beautifully dark places where, 

pleasantly enough, you even get the chance to sing along.

THE BEST & 
WORST FILMS 
OF THE YEAR

T he ball has dropped, resolutions were made and the 2011 film season has begun — the beginning of which, like most new years, 
looks pretty limp-dick (“Season of the Witch”? 
Really, Nick Cage?). Luckily, the sparks from 
2010’s top dogs have enough cinematic crackle to 
power us through 2011’s opening lame ducks. For 
the lazy man, here’s a cheat sheet (in no particu-
lar order) of the best and brightest of 2010’s big 
screen — cowboys, computer nerds and all. 

In Darren Aronofsky’s world, we’re caught 
in a rapidly expanding nightmare birthed from 
the head of Swan Queen ballerina Nina (Natalie 
Portman). Through the dancer’s story mirrors 
Swan Lake’s narrative, it’s unpredictable in its pre-
dictability — creating uncomfortable moments 
of tension between Nina and her competitor 
(Mila Kunis), so much so that the final outcome 
remains masked by the emotional drama. The 
imagery is hauntingly beautiful — faces morph, 
glass shatters and blood blooms from every part 
of Nina’s body, as the sky remains in a perpetual 
and impenetrable darkness, existing in a universe 
seemingly devoid of daylight.

BLACK SWAN

If wit is a man’s greatest treasure, then director David Fincher’s “The Social 
Network” is a gold mine. The movie follows Harvard coed Mark Zuckerberg  
(a headstrong, fast-talking Jesse Eisenberg) as he conceptualizes and realizes 
the now 500-million-strong Facebook.  Armed with razor-sharp dialogue, the 
movie is more a generational introspective and an examination of the human 
condition than a chronicle of a website’s creation. It’s an effortless flow of tal-
ent — from the director’s chair to the camera hand —  making “The Social 
Network” the most complete cinematic experience of 2010. 

FILM OF 
THE YEAR

THE SOCIAL NETWORK
DAVID FINCHER

THE BEST

THE WORST

A movie where the glittering opening montage of New York’s cityscape is, unfortunately, 
the most tolerable part.  As “how to alienate your fan base in 30 minutes or less,” the ladies  
assume the roles of equal-opportunity offenders: first to  gay men, then to Americans and then 
— in a sweeping finale — the entirety of the Middle East. Laughless — and sexless— from the 
beginning to the end. 

As contrived as its namesake,  “Valentine’s Day” shares more similarities to the horrors of 
speed dating than a romantic night on the town. The ensemble comedy shuffles from char-
acter to character, briefly following each through their romantic trysts on (you guessed it) 
Valentine’s Day.  But the film is unwilling to commit — each subsequent character is shallower 
than the last — leaving the overall effect flimsier than the sappy greeting cards it promotes.

Every few years, M.Night Shyamalan tricks us into thinking that he might finally pro-
duce something worth seeing for the first time since 1999’s “Sixth Sense.” With “The Last 
Airbender” (originally called “Avatar”), Shyamalan took a bastardized version of a popular 
television show about a heroic young boy with wind powers and made a subpar live-action 
complement — poorly utilizing the 3D effect used so expertly in James Cameron’s film of the 
same name. After enduring two hours of fumbling acting and dialogue, it lives up to its prom-
ise of being “the last.”

Jonah Hex (Josh Brolin) is an ugly man (second only to Sarah Jessica Parker in this round-
up), but it’s not his fault — his face has been badly charred by baddy Quentin Turnbull (John 
Malkovich), and he’s out to get revenge. The acting is one-note — Brolin growls throughout 
while the prostitute Lilah (Megan Fox) is resolutely emotionless.  Of course, the film doesn’t 
bother to tell us why Turnbull takes an iron-hot poker to Hex’s face (if only he would do us the 
same service) until the very end, and the journey to the answer is long, arduous and not worth 
the wait. The best part is that Fox is finally playing a role she’s suited for.

Johnny Depp should probably stick to playing Tim Burton’s weirdos. In one of his weak-
est performances to date, the actor plays dull everyman Frank, who is roped into a spy vs. 
spy plotline by Elise (Angelina Jolie) as they play cat-and-dead-mouse throughout an Italian 
countryside that’s far more captivating than any insights the characters have to offer.  The real 
clincher is Jolie and Depp’s joint- Golden Globe acting nomination for the most unenthusiastic 
performances committed to film  — even better is the film’s nod for “Best Motion Picture — 
Comedy or Musical.” (Quick spoiler: it’s neither).

TOY STORY 3
LEE UNKRICH

The third installment of the Toy Story franchise is its most successful yet. The tear-jerker transports 
us back into Andy’s familiar home and into the welcoming arms of the lovable toy-troupe we’ve fol-
lowed since Pixar’s inception. A welcome break from the predominately stern 2010 film season, the 
toys of “Toy Story 3” find themselves abandoned at a nursery for ungrateful children and band together 
in a bid for freedom. Whooping and hollering with gusto (and with Buzz, occasionally in Spanish), the 
characters are vivacious as ever.  With an amped-up and effervescent animation style,  this trip to col-
orful toy-land is the best go-to to break up the monotony of Winter-time gloom.

TRUE GRIT
JOEL AND ETHAN COEN

The Coen brothers aren’t known for their 
Western fare, but their remake of the 1969 
film “True Grit” stays true to the canonized 
original, while making use of their iconic 
dark humor.  Scrappy 14-year-old Mattie Ross 
(Hailee Steinfeld) is determined to avenge 
her father’s death by capturing (or killing) his 
murderer. To do so, she hires bear-like U.S. 
Marshal Reuben “Rooster” Cogburn  (Jeff 
Bridges) to track him down. Though Cogburn 
may shoot first and ask later, the Coens’ aim 
is always true: With “True Grit” they’ve cre-
ated a fast-paced film that accentuates each 
character’s strength and shortcomings, without 
degenerating into Western-style caricatures. 

THE KING’S SPEECH
TOM HOOPER

Though it isn’t as pointed as Sorkin’s “The 
Social Network,” “The King’s Speech” is a 
smart biopic of the speech-challenged King 
George — an inspirational story of triumph 
and hardship overcome — without all the 
expected kitsch. Decidedly British in its humor 
and style, “The King’s Speech” is most notable 
for the vetted cast that supports it. Colin Firth’s 
belabored speech, practiced stutter and escalat-
ing frustration are convincing.  When paired 
up with a wife played by Helena Bonham 
Carter and speech therapist played by Geoffery 
Rush, the authenticity of the king’s daily strug-
gle emanates from each tear-filled scene.

If the triumphantly bonkers 
“Shutterbugg” is any indication, Big Boi 
is back, and not just back, but at his peak, 
reminding us that masterful flow and too-
cool-for-school style trump the emotive 
whining of the new kids on the block (we’re 
looking at you, Drake). 

Most importantly, with Sir Lucious 
Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty, the Outkast rapper has crafted 
the party of the year. On his solo debut, Big Boi improves upon his 
half of the 2003 Outkast classic Speakerboxxx/Love Below, weaving 
an orchestra of famous friends (Janelle Monáe, Jamie Foxx, Gucci 
Mane), electro-funk basslines and his own effortlessly clever rhymes 
into a joyous and electrifyingly timeless rap album. In Outkast, 
Big Boi was always the underappreciated anchor to Andre 3000’s 
obvious eccentric. Looks like Andre ain’t got nothin’ on Left Foot 
anymore.  

With the help of producer Danger 
Mouse on 2008’s Attack and Release, the 
Black Keys threw some creative spice into 
their stagnant blues-rock stew. 

But with this year’s Brothers, singer-
guitarist Dan Auerbach and drummer 
Patrick Carney have pushed themselves 
even farther, recording their catchiest and 

most inventive tunes to date. On high point “Everlasting Light,” 
Auerbach dusts off his falsetto, saving his whiskey-induced growl 
for the following one-two-three punch of “Next Girl,” “Tighten 
Up” and “Howlin’ For You” — tracks that pair the band’s signature 
sound with poppier hooks and infectious rhythms. The guys never 
lose sight of their rock ‘n roll roots for a moment, either; they’ve just 
finally learned to make them modern. 

You’d be hard-pressed to find someone in indie rock more pro-
lific than Bradford Cox. Over the course of the last year, the Atlanta 
native not only released an LP with his band Deerhunter, he also 
created four collections of demos called Bedroom Databank under 
solo moniker Atlas Sound. 

It’s this commitment to composition 
that makes his work so phenomenal. Every 
damn note of Deerhunter’s fourth album 
Halcyon Digest is drenched in Bradford 
Cox’s love for music. As the band flits from 
Velvet Underground-style murmurs to 
shoegaze textures and hiccupping beats, 
nostalgic adoration pours through every 

note, hanging from the hinges of Cox’s delicate vocals. Even the 
slightest chord progression is a moment of such astounding crafts-
manship that it almost makes you want to weep (Fine, maybe that’s 
just me).

Cox’s stream-of-consciousness lyrical style gives the tracks a 
welcome ease, while standouts like “Helicopter” and “Coronado” are 
groundbreaking without ever being unnatural. It’s psych-rock with 
the genuine music fan in mind; just get your best headphones on, 
give Halcyon Digest a spin and geek the fuck out. 

The third album from Los Angeles 
producer Flying Lotus ignores all genre 
conventions, giving us a glimpse of the 
future of not only hip-hop, but electronica 
and jazz. Unexpected sounds converge: 
Harps intertwine with loose basslines, dub-
step vibrations underscore a lone trumpet 
solo, strings border rumbling synthesizers. 
Vocals are sparse (Thom Yorke joins the 

mayhem on “…And the World Laughs With You”), but even in 
their absence, the music is totally engrossing. With an unconven-
tional focus on the DJ instead of the MC, Flying Lotus has shown 
the extraterrestrial heights that a genre can reach. I just wish the 
future were here so we could have some more.

LCD Soundsystem mastermind James 
Murphy has had the worst midlife crisis 
ever, mostly because he’s depriving us of 
future jams. The DFA Records founder 
claimed that once he hit 40, his band 
wouldn’t release any more albums. With that 
milestone reached, This Is Happening could 
very well be Soundsystem’s last.  

Fortunately, that isn’t the only thing 

worth mentioning about the album. Happening is the perfect 
conclusion to the band’s decade-long run, filled with a winning 
combination of dance-ready beats and Murphy’s more forlorn takes 
on relationships. While opener “Dance Yrself Clean” has a hypnotic 
build-up from a soft whisper to full-on dance floor synth, the pow-
erfully bittersweet “All I Want” has Murphy repeating, “All I want is 
your pity” over Bowie-esque distortion.  But all we want is another 
record. This ending is too bittersweet. 

I should have hated this record. For one, 
The Monitor is a concept album loosely 
based around the events of the Civil War, 
complete with Abraham Lincoln and Walt 
Whitman excerpts. Add the fact that five of 
the songs clock in at over seven minutes and 
you’d think you’re in for a head-scratching, 
pretentious free-for-all. 

But if you know Titus Andronicus, you know that they don’t 
do head-scratching pretension; the New Jersey smartasses do punk 
anthems the way their home state taught ‘em — angry, bearded and 
a little bit political. 

It’s a big-idea album that still manages to be enjoyable, thanks to 
fist-pumping sing-alongs (“The enemy is everywhere! The enemy 
is everywhere!”) and lead singer Patrick Sickles’ battle-cry howl. 
Congratulations, Titus Andronicus — you have now made me want 
to mosh like it’s 1863. 

While their WASP-y Lacoste polos and 
Sperry Topsiders are worthy of disapproval, 
the Columbia grads of Vampire Weekend 
gave a big middle finger to their dissenters, 
gleefully ditching the sophomore slump 
with Contra. On top of several new sonic 
elements — autotune, M.I.A. samples, 
pounding keyboards — the band has 

crafted a seamless set of globetrotting tunes (the most enjoyable of 
the year) with more emotional vulnerability than we saw from them 
on their 2008 debut.

As if to drive the point home, 
in December, the New York Times 
released 14 silent films titled “14 
Actors Acting,” in which Franco was 
featured. While most of the shorts 
involved melodramatic characteriza-
tions (a crying Tilda Swinton and a 
screaming Jennifer Lawrence), Franco 
was filmed French-kissing a mirrored 
image of himself. Either director 
Solve Sundsbo has a sense of humor, 
or Franco is screwing with us — and 
history indicates that the latter is the 
likelier option.

But no move has been more 
controversial than his decision to 
host the Oscars this year with Anne 
Hathaway. In addition to being one 
of the youngest hosts of all time, 
Franco admitted on “Jimmy Kimmel 
Live” that he took on the role to avoid 
obsessing over the possibility of win-
ning his first Oscar (no host has ever 
taken home the gold man). He essen-
tially took himself out of the equation 
after months of training for a grueling 
and harrowing role — dodging the 
assumption that actors take on char-

acters in hopes of Oscar gold. 
Though the trend is evident to 

anyone who’s followed the UCLA 
grad’s career, the bigger question 
is to what purpose he continues to 
promote such confusion. Other than 
the obvious (it keeps him in the pub-
lic eye), a quick scan of the actor’s 
resume reads like a hodgepodge of 
some of the most interesting and 
dynamic roles in cinema — a freak 
(or maybe a geek?), “Spiderman”’s 
brooding Harry Osborn and now a 
cocksure rock climber. Franco has 
managed what few actors achieve: 
He’s escaped the dreaded typecast, 
keeping his own personality an amor-
phous mass of conflicting stereotypes.

The man’s struck upon a winning 
formula — as the interviews continue 
to roll in and James Franco’s figure 
becomes further convoluted through 
the dregs of pop culture rumor, new 
facets are added to his public persona. 
At this rate, he’s guaranteed one of 
two paths: a fulfilling and varied 
career in cinema, or life as a bipolar 
schizophrenic. I’m betting on the 
former.

CONCERTPREVIEW

Prepare For Some L.A. Noise
Art-punk Duo No Age Will Bring Their New Album to an Energetic 

Show at the Che Cafe on Friday. By Andrew Whitworth

N o Age’s earliest efforts were nice, but they didn’t exactly stand out from the lo-fi crowd — with boundless energy, 
hopelessly distorted guitars and catchy 
vocal lines buried deep within layers of 
noise. But, starting with 2008’s gorgeous 
Nouns, the band has varied their approach, 
balancing squalls of distortion with care-
fully crafted noise sculptures. 

Songs like “Things I Did When I Was 
Dead” and “Impossible Bouquet,” though 
still composed almost entirely of guitar 
noise, feature vocals that — for a change 
— are fully audible, floating above dense 
thickets of ambient feedback loops. 

The band continued this matura-
tion on last year’s Everything in Between, 
combining delicate sound manipulation 
with energetic punk rock on “Glitter” and 
“Valley Hump Crash.” While some songs, 
like the excellent “Fever Dreaming,” main-
tain the relentless pace of the band’s early 
work, much of the record stays at a more 
relaxed tempo, giving the listener a chance 
to savor the band’s increasingly hummable 
melodies.

 Though initially strictly a guitar-and-
drums duo, on their most recent tour, No 
Age added a third member to help control 
the increasingly intricate loop-work on 
Everything in Between. 

The guys are known to put on an 
incredible live show, maintaining a sense 
of energy you’d expect from a punk band. 
No Age is coming to town this Friday for 
a show at the Che Café — an unsurprising 
move, since they got their start at their own 
DIY venue, Los Angeles’ the Smell.

The concertÕs $10, but the Che doesnÕt 
sell advance tickets, so anyone set on 
attending the concert should be sure to line 
up outside on Friday afternoon.

SPORTSÊ THURSDAY, JANUARY 6, 2011Ê THE UCSD GUARDIAN 11 

Video games allow you to 
control your own visual learning. 
They might still be a tad too 
primitive to truly help a technically 
dense sport or specific movement, 
as they have occasional glitches that 
allow the computer to do things 
not even Shaq can manage. 
The games have become 
realistic, but there are always 
moments when virtual sports 
accidentally give a player 
momentary superhuman 
powers. 

But even with their faults, 
playing these games enhances 
tactical skill by helping 
players gain knowledge 
without actually being on 
the field or court. Where 
before teams have watched 
film — and will continue to 
do so in the future to learn 
their opponents’ traits — 
video games will probably be 
employed to allow players to 
be more prepared. 

When a player wants to do 
something, he does it controlling 
his character, just as he would in 
real life, thus improving in the 
process. And since he doesn’t have 
to set up the drill again or even so 
much as get off the couch, he can 

practice, tirelessly, over and over 
again, making transaction costs go 
way down. 

Playing video games offers 
the opportunity to get better 
without tiring, or when practice 
is impossible. They have become  
an excellent choice that is gaining 

popularity and 
will probably be 
mandatory in 
practice schedules 
of the future. 

Game designers 
have the money and 
skill needed to scout 
an opposing team at 
an increasingly high 
level of competency. 
The designers work 
closely with athletes 
to perfect a game’s 
physics and capture 
signature moves. 
Future coaches 
will probably even 
be able to use the 
video games to 
determine another 

team’s strengths, or what offenses 
and defenses will work best against 
them. With the weekly updates 
seen in FIFA, this would be a very 
easy method that could save clubs 
thousands to millions of dollars.

The best example is EA Sports 
and XOS Technologies’ creation of 
the Thunder PlayAction Simulator, 
which allows a team to load its 
plays, or that of an opponent, into 
the “Madden NFL” or “NCAA 
Football” games. It has been used by 
LSU, Oregon, Arizona, Cincinnati, 
Colorado and Tennessee, and it 
seems it won’t be long before the 
technology spreads to the NFL. 
Already, the Madden series features 
incredibly accurate playbooks 
for every NFL team, thanks to 
extensive film study from EA Sports 
designers.

But not everyone’s going to like 
this new direction. Gaming brings 
us towards a more personalized, 
self-absorbed activity that may 
actually take away from the team 
aspect of competition. Competing 
against a machine is naturally 
not as exhilarating, gratifying, or 
entertaining as actually being on 
the field, so sports will never go 
totally virtual. But the hybridization 
of sport and video games is the next 
step in the quickly changing sports 
world.  

Nick’s Super Bowl pick is the 
PHILADELPHIA EAGLES. Look 
for an explanation in Monday’s issue 
of the Guardian.

downplayed the importance of reaching the mark.

“Last year is in the past,” he said. “We try to grow from that

have a totally different group.”

UCSD set the mark with 16 games — well over half its season

East Bay fell to 2-8 overall and 0-6 in conference play with 
the loss. UCSD beat the Pioneers 69-55 at home on Dec. 14,

The Tritons have won three of the their last four games, and

By Liam Rose
Sports Editor

The men’s basketball team picked up a 64-53 win at Cal State East Bay on Monday, sweeping the season series against the Pioneers in the process.
Christian Hatch and Casey Ryan each 

had a double-double, with 24 points and 10 
rebounds for Hatch and 10 points and 17 
boards for Ryan.

“Obviously people tend to look toward 
the points,” head coach Chris Carlson said. 
“But we put a great emphasis on rebounding 
numbers and their ability to defend. For me, 
their rebounding numbers are what really 
stick out from the box score.”

Hatch was 6-9 from the floor and 12-14 
from the free throw line. His point total 
matched a career high set earlier this season 
against Cal State Monterey Bay, and the junior 
center is leading the team with 16.7 points per 
game in conference play.

Tyler McGrath had 13 points coming off 
the bench for the Tritons. The sophomore 
guard was 4-7 from behind the three-point 
line in 26 minutes. Ryan’s rebounding mark 
was a career-high for the 6’ 4” senior guard, 
and came a game after scoring a career-high 28 points 
against Sonoma State last Thursday.

UCSD shot 52 percent from the floor in the first half, 
taking a 32-25 lead at halftime, but gave up 13 points off 

turnovers to East Bay, allowing them to stay in the game. 
The Tritons cooled off in the second half — shooting just 
28 percent — and relied on defense to maintain their 
lead.

“We’re always going to try to hang our hat on our 
ability to defend and rebound,” Carlson said. “Defensively, 

I thought we did a good job. Particularly 
whenever East Bay made a run, we seemed to 
be able to answer it with a stop and a score of 
our own.”

UCSD finished the game with an 
overwhelming 47-23 advantage on the boards.

East Bay twice cut the Tritons’ lead to 
two points in the second half, but UCSD 
responded and pulled away from the Pioneers 
each time. Leading 50-46 with 5:58 left, the 
Tritons scored six unanswered points, four of 
which were by Hatch, to take a 10-point lead. 
The Pioneers converted just three field goals 
for the rest of the game.

With two more road games this weekend, 
the Tritons will need to make sure they can 
convert on the offensive end.

“I thought we gave ourselves great 
opportunities offensively, we just didn’t make 
shots,” Carlson said. “Hopefully we’ll be able 
to take advantage of those more and more as 

we move on, because we need to.” 
UCSD improved to 8-4 overall and 3-3 in the CCAA

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — Despite a rocky start 
to the season, the women’s basketball team tallied a 
season-best 13 three-pointers on Monday, defeating 
Cal State East Bay 82-44. 

UCSD’s perimeter shooting was on full display 
at Pioneer Gymnasium, where the Tritons recorded 
season bests of 61 percent from the field and 57 percent 
from behind the arc.  

“I thought the way we passed the ball led to some 
great shots,” head coach Charity Elliot said. “We had 22 
assists, which is a season high.”

The Pioneers were unable to defend against the 
multiple offensive threats posed by the Tritons, 
who finished the night with all but two out of their 
12-person roster.  

All-American junior guard Chelsea Carlisle led the 
Tritons in scoring with ]18 points on the night, going 
six-for-nine on field goals while also tallying nine 
assists. 

Junior Daisy Feder and sophomores Emily Osga and 

Erin Grady also finished the night with double-digit 
points. Feder came off the bench to lead the Tritons 
in three-pointers, finishing four-for-seven, while Osga 
recorded 12 points and Grady recorded 10 points.   

Cal State East Bay guard Claudia Nelson — the 
Pioneers’ top performer with 10 points and seven 
rebounds — opened up the scoring with a three-
pointer to take the lead. But quick back-to-back field 
goals from Grady and Carlisle put the Tritons up for 
good through the rest of the game.  

The Tritons held onto the lead for the remainder of 
the game, outplaying East Bay and quickly turning the 
game into a route. UCSD shot an incredible 71 percent 
from the floor in the first half and took a 19-point 
lead into halftime. The Pioneers had no answer for the 
Tritons in the second half, handing them an easy win.   

The win marks the Tritons’ sixth victory in eight 
games, moving UCSD to 4-2 in conference play. East 
Bay remained winless in conference play, at 0-6.

“We played well tonight and everyone certainly 
contributed to the overall performance,” Osga said. JOHN HANACEK/GUARDIAN FILE

Junior guard Chelsea Carlisle scored 18 points as the Tritons rolled Cal State East Bay 82-44.

Not everyone can go out and 
bend soccer balls like Cristiano 
Ronaldo, swing a bat like Barry 
Bonds or throw down posterizing 
dunks like Blake Griffin. 

You probably can’t do any of the 
above. In fact, I know you can’t — 

in real life, anyway. But if you sit 
down in front of the television and 
happen to own a gaming system, 
you can. You, sitting there reading 
this, can kick flip a nine-step and 
hit a winning homerun in the 
World Series, all from the comfort 
of your couch.

Video games are becoming more 
and more a part of everyday life, 
especially in terms of sports. If you 
don’t happen to make your high 
school football team, you can play 
“Madden NFL 11” to ease the pain. 
If you’re five-feet-nothing, you can 
still dunk on Shaq in “NBA 2K11.”

Other than being a great 
distraction from your homework, 
these games are actually shaping 
the sports world as we know it, and 
helping to lead the way into the 
future.

Learning in sports is more 
visually based than you might 
think. From experience, just a 
few minutes of watching video of 
yourself can be as effective as hours 
of repetitive training. Watching the 
best teams play each other not only 
adds to your tactical knowledge 
as a player — such as when to 
blitz the quarterback or when to 
substitute a player — but also can 
improve physical responses to the 
perceived environment. In other 
words, by watching, you learn what 
it’s supposed to look like out on the 
field.

Personally, I watch Jan Zelezny, 
the world record holder in the 
javelin, and Andreas Thorkildsen, 
the current world leader, in order 
to improve my javelin form. At 
Arizona, the basketball players 
watch film clips of Steve Nash just 
shooting to enhance their own 
shooting abilities.

“We’re always going to try to 
hang our hat 
on our ability 
to defend 
and rebound. 
Defensively, I 
thought we did 
a good job.”
