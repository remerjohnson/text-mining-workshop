GRIEVANCES DELAY 
ELECTION RESULTS

Louis Ngoc-Duy Nguyen, a 27-year-
old neurosciences graduate student, died 
early Tuesday, March 29, in a case pre-
sumed to be suicide. UCSD released a 
statement on same day. 

“UC San Diego Police and the San 
Diego County Medical Examiner’s Office 
on Tuesday are investigating a suspected 
suicide at a university research building,” 
the statement read. “[He] was found dead 
by paramedics at 3:48 a.m. Tuesday in his 
office at the Center for Neural Circuits 
and Behavior. The investigation is pending 
results of an autopsy.”

The case is still under investigation, 
but the autopsy has been completed by the 
San Diego Medical Examiner’s Office.

“Time of death was 3:40 a.m.” a private 
investigator said. “The cause of death is 
pending further studies.”

No additional statements were released 
by UCSD officials.

Nguyen graduated from UCSD in 
2004 with a B.S. in Biochemistry and Cell 
Biology. He worked in professor Roberto 
Malinow’s lab, which studies diseases like 
Alzheimer’s disease and depression.

Nguyen co-authored four articles for 
journals such as Nature and Molecular 
and Cellular Neuroscience and served 
as a co-editor-in-chief of the first vol-
ume of Saltman Quarterly, the under-
graduate biology research journal. In 
2002, he received a UCSD’s Chancellor’s 
Undergraduate Research Grant and a 
Howard Hughes Undergraduate Research 
Scholarship. 

Nguyen is from San Diego. He is sur-
vived by parent Giao Anh Nguyen. 

The neurosciences department 
could not be reached for comment.

Effective for the class of 2016, San Diego Unified School 
District will require all high school students to complete 
the University of California’s A-G course requirements in 
order to graduate. The school board passed the resolution 
March 29.

The change in policy reflects the school district’s desire 
to provide more opportunities for students who may not 
consider applying to a UC school after high school.

The school board also voted to cut summer school 
programs and use $7.3 million in redevelopment money 
— initially allocated toward a new charter school within 
the downtown — for general education funds at schools. 
Superintendent Bill Kowba found $3.2 million in savings, 
preventing the layoffs of 30 administrators. The budget will 

be finalized June 30.
“It’s time for us to stop using the budget as an excuse 

to not educate kids,” San Diego Education Association 
President Bill Friedman said to the San Diego Union-
Tribune.

According to “Tougher education standards for the class 
of 2016,” a March 29 article that appeared in the San Diego 
Union-Tribune, about $15 million will be spent over the next 
four or five years to make A-G classes available at all San 
Diego high schools. The additional classes are Algebra II, a 
second year of foreign language and an arts course.

The plan, conceived in April 2009, also sets aside fund-
ing for tutoring programs.

According to the San Diego Unified School District web-
site, the resolution is part of the board’s goals to eliminate 

colors of the wind

A.S. election results were delayed for a record three days due to 25 elections grievances filed against various slates 
and referenda campaigns. Grievances are formal 
complaints filed against any member or action 
that has violated election bylaws.

Election results were scheduled to be 
announced at 5:30 p.m. on April 8, but instead 
the elections committee, candidates and cam-
paigners, waited until 3:30 a.m. hoping to hear 
the results. Of the 25 grievance decisions, seven 
were appealed to the A.S. Judicial Board for hear-
ing on April 10.

The extended grievance process caused ten-
sions to run high between members of the 
Students First! slate — which filed 10 of the 25 
grievances — and members of other slates, who 
felt that some of the grievances were unneces-
sary.

At approximately 2 a.m. on April 9, mem-

bers from We Are Tritons, Tritons First! and 
Board the Wing convened with four members 
of Students First! to discuss the grievances and 
the motivation behind them. Presidential candi-
dates Ryan O’Rear, Alyssa Wing and Parminder 
Sandhu and Vice President of Finance candidate 
Lynne Swerhone asked the members about their 
motivations and whether they were trying to 
disqualify the other slates.

According to O’Rear, historically, the only 
reasons for appealing for a decision are to ask for 
apology or disqualification and since the deci-
sions Students First! appealed originally called 
for an apology, some members of the other 
slates felt Students First! were calling for their 
disqualification.

According to Vice President of External 
Affairs candidate Victor Flores-Osorio of

Students First!, his answers to the 
questions — that the slate wanted to 
ensure that elections laws were being 
upheld, campaigns were accountable 
and all results were fair — were not 
satisfactory to the other candidates.

“I answered as truthfully as pos-
sible and they didn’t like it,” Flores-
Osorio said. “They didn’t want that 
answer — they insisted on other 
answers.”

At approximately 3:30 a.m., 
Judicial Board chair Polina 
Tsvetikova announced that the board 
would reconvene at 6 p.m. on Sunday, 
April 10 to hear the appeals. As per 
elections bylaws, results cannot be 
announced until after all grievances 
and appeals have been settled and 
ratified by the sitting A.S. President. 
As a result, the elections committee 
said the results would be announced 
Monday morning.

Election committee members 
said they would not comment on the 
grievances until the entire process 
was completed.

On April 10, the Judicial Board 
began hearings at 8 p.m. Before the 

board could proceed, it  deliberated 
removing judicial board member 
Sarmad Bokhari from a particular 
case. Students, including Marshall 
Student at Large Justice Advocate 
candidate Courtney Hill, alleged that 
he had a conflict of interest because 
his Facebook profile picture dis-
played a Students First! flyer.

The board concluded that Bokhari 
was not a member of and would 
not testify for Students First!, so he 
remained a voting member.

As hearings began, Tsvetikova sad 
that each party would be allowed a 
maximum of 10 minutes to speak, no 
matter the number of witnesses.

The first appeal was brought to 
the board because Students First! 
campaign manager Leslie Manjarrez 
said a verbal apology from the Tritons 
First! slate — the decision mandated 
by the elections committee — was 
insufficient punishment for omitting 
“Vote on TritonLink” from campaign 
posters.

Manjarrez requested that the 
hearing be closed because of harass-
ment against her slate. Associate Vice 
President of Academic Affairs Desiree 

Prevo said that several Students First! 
members received harassing phone 
calls from members of Board the 
Wing and Tritons First! In addition, 
Prevo said disparaging remarks were 
made about the slate on UCSDFML.
com and on Facebook.

“I don’t feel safe when folks have 
been harassing my slate,” Manjarrez 
said.

Students from other slates dis-
agreed over whether to close the 
meeting; the Judicial Board decided 
that the hearing would be private 
to all but the witnesses. It called in 
Students First! campuswide senato-
rial candidate Olivia Cancino to wit-
ness.

After a 40-minute hearing, the 
board upheld the elections commit-
tee’s ruling.

The second appeal was brought to 
the floor because Student Affirmative 
Action Committee Vice Chair Josue 
Castellon said a verbal apology from 
Tritons First! was insufficient action 
for the slate having hung a campaign 
poster at Center Hall.

An April 7 article entitled “Two

the UCEN fee referendum charges 
students $5 per quarter; the refer-
endum charges an additional $5.

A March 31 article entitled 
“Council Installs Condom

rectly stated that the Student

the achievement gap, increase high 
school graduation rates and reduce 
dropout rates among all San Diego 
high school students. 

The school board analyzed 
6,287 transcripts from the graduat-
ing class of 2009 to gauge academic 
performance, UC and California 
State University systems eligibility 
and general trends and patterns of 
enrollment. The report found that the 
number of students completing the 
A-G courses increased over the past 
five years across all ethnic groups. 

About 46 percent of students 
graduate with completion of the A-G 
requirements. But it also revealed 
significant achievement gaps between 
different ethnic groups, with dispro-
portionately few black and Latino 
students graduating with completion 
of the A-G courses. 

The data, from 2008,  shows 
over 50 percent of white and Asian 

students graduated having ful-
filled A-G requirements, compared 
to 30 percent of Latino students 
and 32 percent of black students. 
Black students compose 57 per-
cent of SDUSD students.  
  A 2010 assessment from the 
Consortium on Chicago School 
Research at the University Chicago 
Urban Education Institute found that 
21 states require high schools to com-
plete some form of college prepara-
tory curriculum in order to graduate. 
The report argues that implementing 
mandatory curriculum policies does 
not imply improved outcomes for 
students.

The report found that attendance 
and studying are pivotal elements to 
graduating with A-G completion and 
ninth grade students with nine or 
more absences in a semester have a 41 
percent or lower likelihood of gradu-
ating within four years. The effects of 
the course change on lower-achieving 

students saw increased course failings 
and decreased GPAs.

But UCSD Vice Chancellor of 
Admissions Mae Brown said comple-
tion of the A-G classes will prepare 
more students for higher education.

“The A-G requirements serve as 
excellent preparation for college and 
university admission,” Brown said in 
an email. “UC San Diego is a very 
selective campus. Therefore I strong-
ly encourage prospective students to 
complete the most rigorous curricu-
lum possible.”

According to the Voice of San 
Diego, there will be another option 
for students who are unable to fulfill 
the A-G requirements. 

An alternative high school diplo-
ma will remain available for students 
of alternative schools or adult educa-
tion programs.

n3chan@ucsd.edu.

A-G Requirements Expected to Better Prepare Students
▶ SchoolS, from page 1

Castellon also requested a closed 
hearing. Students First! presiden-
tial candidate Jasmine Phillips then 
called in.

At 10:45 p.m., the board over-
turned the committee decision and 
called a hearing between the two 
slates to go over the evidence again.

Tsvetikova said the rehearing 
was closed to the public and each 
slate could bring in three members. 
Neither slate was allowed to intro-
duce new evidence.

The board decided that Tritons 
First! must write “sorry” on a poster 
as punishment.

Judicial board member Arianna 
Peregretti commented on the discus-
sions going in the room.

“There’s a lot of disrespect in this 

room,” Peregretti said. “This is too 
much. I see the line of segregation 
and it’s disgusting — it’s not respect-
ful.”

The board introduced the third 
appeal, but held it off to deliberate. 
At press time, only two of the appeals 
had concluded. The following appeals 
were slated to take place after 12 a.m. 
on April 11.

The third and fourth appeals 
were from Students First! against the 
elections committee’s decisions with 
Board the Wing. One of the appeals 
was an issue that was voided by the 
elections committee and the other 
found Board the Wing guilty, though 
there were no sanctions.

“If they can’t follow election rules, 
how are they going to handle a mul-
timillion dollar budget?” Eleanor 

Roosevelt College Students First! sen-
atorial candidate Bruno Huizar said.

The fifth appeal was between GSA 
political science representative Jeffrey 
Kwong and the elections commit-
tee’s decision that the No Fee Hike 
Committee was dorm storming by 
placing fliers underneath doors of 
residential dorms.

The sixth appeal is A.S. Election 
Manager Senam Payendah against 
the election committee’s decision to 
invalidate the University Centers ref-
erendum. The seventh appeal is the 
University Centers fee pro-campaign 
against the election committee’s deci-
sion to invalidate the UCEN fee.

San Diego Union School District is taking steps to make a UC education a more 
feasible option for its graduates. 
Beginning with the class of 2016 (or 
current seventh graders), students 
in the district will be required to 
fulfill the UC A-G requirements 
— a set of 15 classes across several 
disciplines — in order to graduate 
high school. 

This expansion will benefit 
students by requiring local high 
schools to offer these A-Gs; oth-
erwise, students attending schools 
that don’t offer all the courses may 
be thrown off the path to a UC edu-
cation before they realize it. This 
program will ensure that students 
with poor planning will not meet 
UC requirements without even 
knowing it. 

A 2009 Education Trust-West 
study of the district found that only 
46 percent of SDUSD students who 
graduated fulfilled the A-G require-
ments necessary to apply to the 

UC. Only about 67 percent of the 
SDUSD class of 2009 was able to 
take all 15 courses required for the 
A-G requirements.

Currently, SDSU students need 
only pass three math classes (or up 
to geometry to graduate) — one 
class level below UC requirements. 
Similar standards are upheld in 
foreign languages and the arts, 
in which students must take an 
additional year each to meet UC 
requirements.  

The district’s new requirements 
will ultimately amount to three 
additional course requirements over 
four years. The A-G course require-
ments demand that high school 
students complete three years of 
college-preparatory math classes 
through Algebra II, in which stu-
dents must receive a grade of “C” 
or higher — meaning the SDUSD 
must add an extra math course in 
order to meet the proposed require-
ments.  
     The $15 million this program 

costs will be well spent. Nervous 
administrators need only look to 
the San Jose School District, which 
made similar changes in 2002 to 
great success. Initial worries that 
low-performing students might 
drop out en masse have proven 
unfounded — graduation rates have 
held steady over the last decade, as 
have average GPAs. 

The initiative, as in San Jose, 
won’t stand alone. The program 
plans to expand tutorial programs 
and add the option of taking classes 
at alternative schools that will allow 
students to fulfill the new require-
ment. San Jose School District 
partnered its program with a mass 
recruitment of qualified teachers to 
teach new foreign language, math 
and science classes. 

Most important, SJSD created a 
“D plan” that allows students who 
don’t plan on college to take less 
strenuous classes and still receive a 
diploma. About 15 percent of stu-
dents in the district have opted to 

follow that route.
This program is a game changer 

that will allow the SDUSD to pro-
vide more students with the oppor-
tunity to easily fulfill requirements. 
And while a four-year university or 
a UC education may not be realistic 
for every student, the district has at 
least made it more of an option for 
all local high school students. 

Tougher Local High School Requirements Will Benefit Students

As a rule, I start off most quarters optimistic. No mat-ter what doom I’ve endured 
the previous 10 weeks with a dead-
beat TA or scoliosis-inducing stack 
of books, there’s unceasing hope 
for that silver-screen moment dur-
ing Week One when an electrifying 
professor (“visiting lecturer” or “cute 
MFA student” will do) snaps me 
out of my sleepwalk with a riveting 
lecture and reading list that claims a 
tasteful blend of tragicomedy, mys-
tery and sex. (Obvious bonus points 
for any further exploration of those 
themes in office hours). 

Once again, my quarterly fan-
tasy’s proven more than a little 
far-fetched. Maybe I’ve gone soft in 
my third year, but I don’t remem-
ber ever feeling as overwhelmed or 
as isolated by Week Three as I do 
now. Entire history books have gone 
unread and papers unwritten — and 
while I do hazily remember pass-
ing seventh-grade Language Arts, I 
still can’t seem to master something 
called a grammar tree, which appar-
ently I have to if I ever want to 
graduate with a B.A. in writing.

A guiltier lit major might look 
inward: at class time wasted sleep-
ing, or working, or, in moments of 
fleeting contemplation, estimating 
how much time remains before he 
finally breaks down and cusses out 
the Greenpeace dude on Library 
Walk. (Negative 19 days and count-
ing.)  

But I don’t actually feel guilty, 
and I don’t think I’m the only one. 
The truth is, it’s a whole hell of 
a lot harder to motivate yourself 
when you have no connection to 
the people you’re learning from. For 
what won’t be the last time in my 
college career, each of the lecture 
halls and seminar rooms I have class 
in is stuffed to max capacity. In one, 
an upper-div history class with an 
enrollment of 200, my professor’s 
even set up semi-mandatory weekly 
sections to break up the anonymity.

For all UCSD’s talk of “excel-
lence,” taking furious notes from 
the 20th row back doesn’t inspire 
the all-consuming love affair with 
coursework that so many ad cam-
paigns and campus tours made me 
imagine. 

To be clear, I don’t blame my 
professors. Most of them teach two 
classes or more at once, and a gram-
mar tree, truthfully, only leaves so 
much room for spellbinding, urban-
high-school-movie-style instruction. 

Professors aren’t responsible for 
everybody crowding the aisles in 
lecture, either. UC President Mark 
G. Yudof is an easy target for that 
one, but it’s not exactly his fault: The 
UC system is pretty damn broke, 
and with a $500-million budget cut 
due for fall, will be significantly bro-
ker in no time (translation: 300-seat 
history classes). 

Most student government hope-
fuls last week — invigorated by 
the prospect of serving you, the 
students, or maybe that ‘B’ spot 
upgrade — had exactly the answer 
for old curmudgeons like me: rais-
ing our own tuition for sports teams 
and a frat row. But what do I know? 
Maybe a toga party, for now, is the 
best defense against isolation we can 
hope for.

The greener paTh 

Come Fall Quarter, plastic water bottles may be per-manently out of stock on 
campus. A.S. Council President Wafa 
Ben Hassine is making good on an 
old campaign promise: this week 
marks the writing of a final draft of a 
bottled-water ban to be proposed to 
Housing and Dining Services. 

The project is twofold: first to 
discourage students from purchas-
ing the bottles while they are read-

ily available, and then to ban them 
altogether. Regardless of how late in 
her term the proposal’s coming to 
administrators’ desks, it’s still a wor-
thy cause that will hopefully influ-
ence a new generation of students to 
break the habit of using plastic water 
bottles. 

Ben Hassine herself said she 
hopes the campaign will educate 
students to make long-lasting life-
style changes. A.S. Council will hold 

workshop presentation and other 
events in collaboration with other 
campus sustainability groups to 
encourage students to support the 
ban. These events include February’s 
“Breaking the Plastic Habit” event 
at Porter’s Pub, which included a 
concert and film screening to raise 
awareness of water conservation and 
plastic waste.

A.S. Council President Wafa Ben Hassine’s program to ban bottled water in dining halls 
and Styrofoam in Price Center will help produce a greener, more sustainable campus.

ThE LiTTLE RinTRAh By Eileen Shi

A campuswide campaign consist-
ing of facts about the waste could 
be a good start. The events seem 
promising as long as A.S. Council 
is able to get the word out so that 
attendance at such events is enough 
to produce tangible change. It is 
hard to tell just yet how the events 
will make an impact on the student 
mindset, given the general apathy 
present on campus. Yet enacting the 
ban will likely be the jolt students 
need to realize the enormity of their 
waste: According to the Earth Policy 
Institute, 86 percent of plastic water 
bottles end up as garbage.

UCSD wouldn’t be the first 
campus to implement a ban: Seattle 
University, DePauw University and 

Washington University in St. Louis 
have already barred water bottles 
from campus, and UC Santa Cruz 
has a similar measure in the works. 

All of these bans started from 
student initiatives, as the project 
doesn’t require much in the way of 
start-up costs.

Not every campus that attempts 
to ban water bottles is successful. 
At Cornell, efforts stalled due to the 
university’s contract with Pepsi (the 
parent company of Aquafina). 

For UCSD, additional costs are 
necessary to build more water foun-
tains and filters — the costs of which 
are not finalized, and will be paid 
for by Housing and Dining Services 
after the initial proposal.

Many perceive bottled water as 

cleaner than tap, but private cor-
porations are not regulated to the 
extent that tap water is. Bottled water 
undergoes extra filtering for taste, 
but the bad taste of tap water tastes 
comes from minerals, not because it 
is unclean — so sparing those extra 
couple of bucks on a bottle of Evian 
can’t be said to have any negative 
impact on anyone’s health. 

The proposed ban shows that Ben 
Hassine’s office is making important, 
concrete steps toward reducing our 
carbon footprint. This change could 
even represent that rare sweeping, 
practical reform that most often 
eludes council.

Campuswide Ban on Water Bottles a Responsible Alternative
▶ Bottles, from page 4

Dear Editor,
It has been wrongly alleged that 

in the 2011 A.S. elections, the slate 
“Students First” sought to disqualify 
other slates on trivial grounds. We 
hope to demonstrate that such accu-
sations are false and that Board the 
Wing and Tritons First have egre-
giously violated the election bylaws. 
We are not attempting to target slates 
to gain an unfair advantage—rather, 
we are following due process to ensure 
that student government elections pri-
oritize true democratic values.

Students First has existed since 
1992. In the 2003 elections, Students 
First was disqualified after alleged 
cheating that included repeated 
breaches of bylaws. This slate dis-
qualification presents an indisputable 
standing precedent: Violating the 
same rules repeatedly will result in 
severe consequences. 

We had hoped that Board the 
Wing and Tritons First would con-
duct their campaign fairly. We have 
friendships and working relationships 
with people in those slates, and we 
are not seeking tension. Yet, friend-
ships must exist outside of the council 
floor in order to promote the impera-
tive of representative democracy. 
Unfortunately, we repeatedly wit-
nessed actions that breached bylaws, 
reflecting unethical behavior that 
undermined the democratic process. 
The following are election violations:

•Telling people while they are at a 
voting booth how to vote on specific 
candidates: disempowering voters 
through coercive tactics, which pre-
vent constituents from making their 
own informed decisions

•Illegal soliciting in private resi-
dence hall space: disrupting other stu-
dents in res halls without RA permis-

sion; numerous witnesses, including 
residents and RA, testified about such 
disruptions

•Failure to place “Vote at tritonlink.
ucsd.edu” on all election posters: a 
repeated violation in which Tritons 
First disregarded warnings from the 
election manager that if repeated, 
would result in severe consequences

These actions unduly alter vot-
ers’ choice while giving some slates 
unfair advantages. Elected A.S. council 
leaders are responsible for making 
important decisions as representatives 
of student interests. Student leaders 
cannot be trusted to make informed 
decisions about a multimillion dollar 
budget if they cannot, even under the 
duress of campaigning, follow bylaws. 
How can we expect these leaders to be 
able to ensure accountability in council 
when they refuse to hold themselves 
accountable? There is a reason why 
regulations exist: to ensure fairness for 
all students so their voices are heard in 
all aspects of student governance.

We believe that it is necessary 
to hold all candidates to a higher 
standard. We have filed grievances to 
uphold the people’s choice so that it is 
unfettered by undemocratic actions. 
We encourage students to take a criti-
cal look at slates’ campaign actions to 
ensure that ethical leaders represent 
their constituents’ needs, not subvert 
them. The voting procedure, and 
especially the will of the students 
themselves, must be respected.

LEISURE

With set menus, hours and pric-es, campus dining halls often feel like an extension of high school’s oversanitized cafeteria 
— options seem limited, even to the easy-
going diner. And for those bound by vegan 
and vegetarian dietary restrictions, navigating 
on-campus nosh is an even chancier game 
of “What’s that on my plate?” Meanwhile, for 
those considering the meatless jump, the gap 
between the two types seems insurmountable. 

UCSD might not have broken PETA2’s 
vegetarian top-10 list this year (hippie-friendly 
UC Berkeley landed a spot at No. 8 and is the 
only UC school to earn any accolades), but 
fortunately, Housing and Dining Services is still 
trying to up its game. 

Adventurous students willing to try their 
hand at campus vegetarian fare are in good 
company  — according to a Harris interactive 
study conducted in 2008, an estimated 7.3 mil-
lion adults in the U.S. follow a vegetarian-based 

diet.
“Our dining program has been the campus 

leader in partnering with students to bring 
Fair Trade, organic and cage-free egg prod-
ucts into our operations, and our dining staff 
have brought forward the concept of ‘Meatless 
Mondays’ and increased vegetarian and vegan 
options in support of both customers who 
embrace a meatless lifestyle and those who 
wish to have as broad a range of dining options 
available to them,” Mark Cunningham, director 
of Housing, Dining and Hospitality Services 
said in an email. Additionally, HDH plans on 
opening a new vegetarian dining venue in Muir 
College that will open in Fall 2011.

Until then, UCSD’s registered dietitian and 
health educator, Rebecca McDivitt (who offers 
free diet counseling for students living on cam-
pus), has a few suggestions for vegetarians 
trying to survive the day-to-day dilemma of 
on-campus eating.

“There are six major things every human 

needs — carbohydrates, protein, fat, various 
vitamins and minerals and water, and those are 
literally the building blocks of life,” McDivitt 
said. “The first three that I mentioned are mac-
ronutrients: We need those in larger quantities 
as compared to the micronutrients, which are 
the vitamins and minerals.”

Though how much of each category the 
average person needs to stay healthy depends 
on a variety of factors including height, weight, 
gender and age, the most important thing is to 
keep your diet balanced and varied.

“You really want to do two things — cover 
carbohydrates, proteins, fats and minerals by 
having many different kinds of those that you’re 
actually consuming,” McDivitt said. “And also, 
not actually trying to eat too many of the same 
exact thing, which is called food jagging.” 

For vegetarians and vegans, making sure 
that all dietary needs are met without the help

Options may seem skimpy, but UCSD’s 
Housing and Dining Services offers 

an expansive list of vegetarian dishes 
(many of which, according to McDivitt, 
can be modified for vegans). And here’s 

the good news — all the dining halls 
rotate through the same menu. So, even 
if you’re stuck eating at Plaza, you won’t 

be scrambling to find animal-friendly 
options.

N estled in a scenic valley just 15 minutes from campus, Rancho El Camino Equestrian Center boasts six riding arenas, two barns and two 
round pens, as well as a plethora of adjacent trails.  
        It not only offers affordable lessons tailored to all skill 
levels, but also provides training, boarding, leasing and 
trailer parking. 

Patrons need not worry about getting yelled at by 
impatient instructors or being thrown off an unruly horse. 
Dressed down in jeans and T-shirts, easy-going trainers 
are supportive of everyone, especially beginners.

The horses themselves are exemplary: The equines have 
been trained and socialized for years, making them gentle 
and responsive to new riders. 

Some tower over shorter riders, but their trainers 
will either observe from the ground or ride alongside 
you, depending on your skill level, to ensure your safety 
throughout. 

Lessons explore everything from grooming and sad-
dling to the style and mechanics of riding. 

You can get your cowboy on by studying Western style 
and learning jumping tricks, or go more prim and proper 
with dressage training. 

Just a heads up: Riding and mastering a horse comes 
with a price — leaden, sore arms and inner thighs that hit 
hard by the end of the day.

 You can ride your own horse at Rancho El Camino, or 
try your hand at one of theirs; the REC website has photos 
and profiles of most of the center’s dozen horses online, 
and reading them will help you get an idea of which to 
choose. 

Horseback riding isn’t a cheap hobby no matter how 
you slice it, but fortunately, Rancho El Camino is among 
the more affordable centers. 

Lesson prices range from $40 to $65, depending on the 
number of students in each group and the length of the 
lesson. 

Package rates are also offered: eight lessons for $360 or 
four for $220. Horses can be leased for up to three days a 
week and pricing is determined by the owner.

 As for boarding, barn stalls begin at $580, pipe pens at 
$425 a week. Trailer parking prices start at $45 a week. The 
ranch is open every day from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

you don’t have to give up your favorite carbohydrate to stay trim. ucsd’s reg-
istered dietitian, rebecca mcdivitt, has a feW recommendations for choosing 

the healthiest loaf of bread from your local grocer.   

“Breads made from whole grains have more fiber and potentially more selenium, potassium and magnesium, so choosing 
whole grain breads over refined grain breads when you can is a good idea,“ McDivitt said. “To find out if a [loaf of] bread is a 
whole grain bread, look at the ingredient list. Choose breads that list “whole wheat” or “whole grain” as the first ingredient (or 
among the first ingredients.) Also look for breads that have at least three grams of fiber per slice.”

Sliced Bread

of meat and animal by-products exacerbates the challenge. The biggest 
challenge for vegans is getting the required dose of vitamin B12, which 
deals with blood clots, cells and tissue repair.

But McDivitt doesn’t recommend popping vitamins without con-
sulting a doctor or dietitian first because of the chance of overdose, 
though the nutritionist says fortified foods — or foods with vitamins 
and minerals added into them, like soymilk and cereal — are an excel-
lent resource for vegans and vegetarians. But first, it’s important for 
vegans and vegetarians to first identify the foods they’re eliminating 
from their diets.

“For a newly converted vegan or vegetarian, I would start with, 
‘what have you eliminated from your diet and based on those elimina-
tions, what should we replace?’” McDivitt said. “So if a person used to 
eat a lot of chicken, or a lot of beef, the way to replace protein sources 
would be beans, peas, lentils, or maybe soy based products and meat 
replacement products.”

At campus dining halls, vegan and vegetarian dishes have at least 
one carbohydrate, fat and protein. The abundance of vegan and vegetar-
ian dishes and the presence of large salad bars at each dining hall (the 
largest of which is located at Eleanor Roosevelt College’s Café Ventanas) 
reduces the need for college students to compose their own dishes, 
but McDivitt has some suggestions for those looking to strike out on 
their own — like replacing fish’s omega3 fatty acids with the fatty acids 
derived from flax.

“I think cereal is actually a good option for vegans because it has a 
number of vitamins and minerals in it, and they can obviously get soy 
milk,” McDivitt said. “But if you’re kind of sick of that, as a vegan, you 
can always do toast with peanut butter, or we might have a special like 
a tofu scramble.”

And though the fare may not be as appealing to a new convert, veg-
etarian grub does have some fairly significant benefits. For one, dishes 
tend to be cheaper without meat, and a vegetarian’s carbon footprint is 
far smaller than a meat eater’s. 

 “If they choose wisely, they can lower their risk of some cancers and 
heart disease and that’s because we do know there’s an association with 
high animal fat intake and heart disease,” McDivitt said. “There’s even 
the concept of lowering your greenhouse gas emission, and that has to 
do with the fact that processing animal foods, particularly beef, takes 
a lot of water. And cows, as strange as it is, produce a lot of methane, 
which contributes to greenhouse gas emission.” 

But according to McDivitt, the key to being a healthy vegan or 
vegetarian is to always ask questions — of the serving staff (which is 
trained to alter dishes and look out for animal by-products), of doctors 
and even of the dietitian herself.

“I really, really encourage all students, particularly students who are 
new to a certain kind of eating, to actually ask a manager, ‘Hi, I’m vegan, 
what do you have today?’” McDivitt said. “Because we’re all trained in 
how to answer that question. We’ll make sure that person gets the kind 
of food that they need.”

RESTAURANTREVIEW • ANDREW WHITWORTH

a sprawling gastropub located in a browning, aged building in North Park, West Coast Tavern calls itself 
“a modern culinary collective celebrating 
old-world luxuries.” 
  For an old-school pub with such lofty 
ambitions, the menu at West Coast 
Tavern looks pretty pedestrian (there’s 
an entire section devoted to TGI Friday’s 
favorites like sliders, hot wings and onion 
rings). But fear not: One bite of a tender 
Niman Ranch pulled-pork slider, topped 
with garlic aioli and a warm toasted egg 
bun, bars all Applebee’s comparisons. 

One disadvantage to the 
tavern’s approach is the puz-
zling portion sizes. Many 
dishes fall in a gray area 
between entrée and tapa, 
and inconsistencies make the 
ordering process a confus-
ing one. 

Still, you’re spoiled for 
choice. 

An excellent place to 
start is the Tavern’s Bacon-
Wrapped Nut-Stuffed Dates, 
served with a goat cheese dip-
ping sauce ($8.25). 

Though the dish consists 
of only four dates (and is part of the 
confusing seafood/chicken/appetizers 
section of the menu), it’s a standout on an 
excellent menu. 

The dish marries sweet and earthy 
flavors in each date’s thick, chewy center, 
wrapped delicately in a salty bacon slice 
— all of which goes down best coated in 
the surprisingly light goat cheese dipping 
sauce. 

Another standout is the Mac & Cheese 
Du Jour ($9.50). Fusing traditional com-
fort food with an unexpected blend of 

red pepper puree, arugula and parmesan, 
the Mac & Cheese is representative of 
West Coast Tavern’s overarching mission: 
drunk food done right. 

Another playfully unique choice is the 
Tavern Chicken & Waffle ($9.50), which 
consists of fried jidori chicken served 
with a bacon-infused waffle. 

Though the accompanying maple 
syrup masks the subtle saltiness of the 
chicken, it’s another enjoyable reinterpre-
tation of a comfort food classic. 

Less successful is the Tavern’s unpleas-
antly citrus-heavy Pan Seared Alaskan 

King Salmon ($14), served 
with black currant grilled 
onion risotto and cherry 
tomato confit. 

Though the salmon was 
flaky and tender, the cur-
rant in the risotto was near 
undetectable, and the dish 
as a whole was rather bland. 

The tavern also falls 
short on desserts —  while 
the Hot Apple Cobbler ($7) 
was warm and spiced with 
clusters of cinnamon,  the 
organic porter-infused Lava 
Cake ($7) was disappoint-

ingly dry, and the Crème Brulée Trio ($7) 
was overpowered by the added flavors 
(raspberry, spiced apple and peanut but-
ter — the last of which was particularly 
pronounced.)

The menu’s a refreshing update on 
lowbrow fare that tends to be overlooked 
by other midrange American joints. 

And while the tavern may not be 
prime first-date material, it’s certainly an 
above-par choice for anybody stumbling 
through North Park with a serious case of 
Friday-night drunchies.

TriTon Track ShineS in rainy 
condiTionS in The deSerT
By Liam Rose
Sports Editor

TRACK & FIELD — The UCSD track and 
field team split over the weekend, with select 
athletes competing at the 32nd Annual Sun 
Angel Classic and the majority of the team 
at the Pomona-Pitzer Invitational.

The Sun Angel Classic, hosted by 
Arizona State, features mostly Division-I 
programs. Participants had to contend with 
uncharacteristic weather for Tempe, Ariz., 
with low temperatures and rain. 

The 4x400 relay team — consisting of 
freshman Lauren Irish, junior Jacqueline 
Rose, junior Caitlin Meagher and senior 
Kelly Fogarty — improved on an existing 
NCAA provisional qualifier with a fifth-
place finish in 3:45.99. Brigham Young 
University won the event in 3:43.73. 

“The relay ran very well,” head coach 
Tony Salerno said. “3:45.99 against some 
tough company. It was [in the] low 40s and 
raining by [the] time we were doing that. 
But they really laid it down.”

Fogarty competed in the premier sec-
tions of both sprint events, the 100- and 
200-meter dash, and finished an impressive 
third in both. Fogarty clocked 12.03 in the 
100, finishing behind Shawna Anderson of 
Oklahoma and Lawreta Ozah of San Diego 
State. Her time of 24.06 in the 200 placed 
her only behind Charonda Williams — an 
Adidas-sponsored athlete — and Tameka 
Williams of Central Arizona. Fogarty and 
the rest of the field had slightly slower 
times than expected due to the cold and 
rainy conditions throughout the meet. 

“It was slow,” Salerno said. “She had 
pretty stiff headwinds in both, and it was 
cold, which is not good for sprinters. Even 
if the times aren’t that impressive, you look 
at who she’s running against and who she 
beat and that gives a good indicator that 
she ran well.”

Senior Danielle Thu also competed in 
the premier section of her best event — 
the hammer throw — and took home 

another third-place finish. Thu finished 
with her second-best throw ever with a 
mark of 197’1”, and was less than two 
inches shy of the 198’8” throw that won 
her the 2009 NCAA title in the event. U.S. 
Olympian Jessica Crosby won the event 
with a throw of 236’11”, setting meet and 
stadium records in the process. 

“That’s Danielle, she’s an old pro,” 
Salerno said. “She’s seen Jessica [Crosby] 
three or four times now in her career head-
to-head, and she just lines up and goes.”

Meagher recorded a personal record in 
the 400-meter hurdles, clocking a time of 
1:01.02 and picking up a provisional quali-
fier. The time should be fast enough to get 
Meagher to the national meet, based on 
previous years’ cutoff times. 

Senior Theresa Richards picked up a 
seventh-place finish in the javelin with a 
toss of 133’9”.

On the men’s side, senior Jesse Morrill 
was ninth in the 3000-meter steeplechase, 
coming in with a time of 9:30.33.

Junior Ka Wai Ng took seventh place in 
the triple jump with a mark of 45’11.25”. 

While the Sun Angel Classic featured 
top-notch competition, the Pomona-
Pitzer Invitational was no slouch either, 
with Division-I schools including USC, 
University of Nevada Las Vegas and 
Pepperdine University. Even with the top 
athletes in Arizona, the Tritons still got four 
of the top 10 finishes on both the men’s and 
women’s sides of the event.

Senior Erin Langford was fourth in the 
triple jump, getting a mark of 36’11.75”, and 
sophomore Katie Kane was also fourth with 
a time of 11:38.22 in the steeplechase.   

Senior Andrew Tran had the top finish 
on the men’s side, leaping 44’8.25” in the 
triple jump to take fourth place. 

The Tritons will be back in action next 
weekend at the Soka Peace Invitational in 
Aliso Viejo, Calif.

Tritons Get Series Win Over No. 16 Sonoma State

UCSD tore apart Seawolf starter Kendall Davis, 
knocking him out of the game after four runs in 
only a third of an inning. His replacement didn’t 
fare much better, and the Tritons led 9-0 going into 
the bottom of the third. But senior Triton starter 
Taylor Austin (2-0) gave up a solo home run in 
the fourth and RBI single in the fifth, and exited 
the game after four and one-third innings with the 
bases loaded. Senior reliever Eric Abraham allowed 
two runs to score. 

Junior Tony York came in for Abraham and 
loaded the bases in the bottom of the seventh 
before exiting the game. Junior Elias Tuma took the 
mound and allowed three runs to score, but struck 
out the final batter swinging to kill the Seawolf rally. 

April 10
UC San Diego 8, Sonoma State 6

Three Seawolf errors cost Sonoma State as 
UCSD picked up the series win.

The Tritons jumped out to an early 3-0 lead in 
the first inning with back-to-back home runs from  
La Face and Aaron Bauman. La Face added another 
RBI in the third with sac fly, although scored a run 
in the second and third to the score to 4-2.

Sonoma loaded the bases in the fifth inning and  
Dickson delivered, launching a grand slam to give 
the Seawolves the lead. But the Tritons countered 
with three of their own in the seventh, and Sonoma 
couldn’t find any more offense. 

UCSD needed five pitchers to get through 
the game, with starter Jeff Rauh only lasting two 
innings while giving up two runs and walking 
three. Tony York (1-0) allowed just two hits in three 
innings of relief to pick up the win, and Elias Tuma 
recorded the final five outs to pick up his fourth 
save of the season.

“I can’t say enough about how our guys com-
peted both [Saturday] and [Sunday],” head coach 
Dan O’Brien said. Especially after one of our worst 
games of the year on Friday. We’re bringning home 
some gutsy wins from a tough place to play against 
a very solid ballclub.”

UCSD to Play Final Home Series This Weekend
Sepulveda got on base and scored off of a pair of 
errors made by the Warrior infield.

Up 2-0, UCSD would record only one hit until 
the fourth inning when Nicole Spangler doubled 
up the middle. Pinch runner Katrin Gabriel ran the 
bases for Spangler, and scored off a pair of sacrifice 
bunts.  Dyanna Imoto scored off a Woofter RBI, 
while Woofter was brought home on the next at-
bat after a wild pitch.

Stanislaus would recover two runs in the 
sixth inning after an error by Gabriel, but UCSD 
responded by scoring off another wild pitch to put 
the game out of reach.

April 9 (GAme 2)
UC San Diego 6, Cal State Stanislaus 4

Pitcher Esther Strom helped her own cause by 
going three-for-four with three RBI as the Tritons 
took the last game of the series in wild fashion..  

Stanislaus took the early lead, going up 2-0 
after Missy Corral sent a double down the left side. 

eventually advancing home, while the next at-bat 
would steal home.

The Tritons equalized in the second inning, 
when Strom hit a two-RBI double into left field. 
Emily McQuaid and Gabriel came in to score later 
in the inning, helped in part by a fielding error 
made by pitcher Brittani Weatherford. 

Strom picked up her second RBI in the fifth 
inning by bringing in Romero, who lead UCSD off 
with a double down the left field line.

Stanislaus tied up the game at the bottom of the 
fifth when Corral launched a two-run home run.

Going into their last at-bat, the Tritons capital-
ized on another costly Stanislaus error.  With men 
on first and second, Rhiannon Ousley laid down 
a sacrifice bunt, bringing Sepulveda in to score.  
Strom followed up by singling up the middle to 
plate Imoto, and the Tritons held on for the win.

The No. 9 Tritons are now 29-8 overall, and 
17-6 in the conference.  UCSD has two remaining 
conference matchups before heading in to post 
season play, including their last home series this 
weekend against Sonoma State.

April 8
Sonoma State 5, UC San Diego 1

 
Senior Triton starter Tim Shibuya (6-3) 

allowed just one earned run and struck out nine, 
but took the loss as untimely mistakes cost the 
Tritons.

Senior Blake Tagmyer got the Tritons rolling 
in the top of the first with an RBI single up the 
middle, but UCSD left two runners stranded. 
Shibuya got two quick groundouts in the bot-
tom of the first and should have had the final 
out of the inning with a swinging strikeout on 
O’Keyea Dickson, but the ball got by senior 
catcher Michael Benton and Dickson reached 
first on a passed ball. Shibuya gave up a single 
and a triple to the next two batters, bringing in 
two unearned runs. 

The Tritons had trouble generating offense 
for the rest of the game, and only had three hits 
after the first inning while leaving eight runners 
on base for the game.

UC San Diego 5, Sonoma State 3

Senior Guido Knudson tossed six and one-
third strong innings and the Tritons survived 
several costly errors to get the win in the open-

ing game of the doubleheader.
Errors by sophomore center fielder Danny 

Susdorf and third baseman Evan Kehoe helped 
two Seawolves score in the second inning, and 
a double steal put Sonoma State up 3-0 after 
three innings. The Tritons tied it up in the top 
of the fourth, as the Tritons capitalized on a 
pair of Seawolf errors and a double by senior 
catcher Kellen Lee. The Tritons took the lead 
their next time at the plate, with an RBI single 
from Tagmyer and RBI double from freshman 
designated hitter Nick La Face.

Knudson (4-3) struck out six and scattered 
six hits in six and one-third innings of work. 
Junior reliever Justin Burns was perfect for the 
remainder of the game to pick up his second 
save of the year.

UC San Diego 9, 
Sonoma State 7 (7 innings)

Neither starter had a terrific outing, as the 
bats came alive in the nightcap of the double-
header, but the Tritons got the better end of it 
despite nearly blowing a 9-0 lead in the seven-
inning game.

UC San Diego 2, 
Cal State Stanislaus 1

 
After winning the silver bracket of the 

Tournament of Champions last weekend, No. 
9 UCSD returned to Turlock to face off against 
CSU Stanislaus.  

The Tritons took the early lead when Kris 
Lesovsky homered to left field in the third 
inning.  UCSD loaded the bases after Taylor 
Sepulveda singled to center field and Stanislaus 
pitcher Brittani Weatherford walked two of the 
next three batters, but the Tritons were unable 
to convert.

UCSD pitcher Camile Gaito — recently 
named conference player of the week alongside 
Triton second baseman Jennifer De Fazio — 
responded in the bottom of the third by strik-
ing out two more Warriors in her 19th win of 
the season.

In the top of the fourth, Maya Romero 
singled to center field, and advanced to second 
off of a sacrifice bunt by Katrin Gabriel.  A 
Sepulveda RBI brought Romero home.

Cal State Stanislaus 3, 
UC San Diego 2

A weak defensive showing in the first inning 
put UCSD 3-0 in the hole, and the Tritons were 
unable to recover. 

Triton pitcher Tess Granath (6-5) walked 
the first two batters, who stole to position 
themselves onto second and third.  With no 
outs, Kiley Mendez bunted to bring home both 
runners and advanced to second off of a throw-
ing error by Granath.  Veronica Luna doubled 
to left field to bring Mendez in to score.

The Tritons rallied in the seventh when 
De Fazio hit a two-out two-run home run. 
Lesovsky followed up, doubling to centerfield, 
and advanced to third off of a wild pitch.  But it 
was too little too late as Sepulveda hit an infield 
popfly to end the game.

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL — The 
UCSD men’s volleyball team had a 
tough weekend, losing two matches 
on the road against unranked Cal 
State Northridge and No. 5 Cal State 
Long Beach.

The Cal State Northridge 
Matadors swept the Tritons 25-22, 
25-19 and 25-18 and had .322 hits 
in comparison to the Tritons’ .263. 
The Matadors had eight blocks 
while the Tritons had 4.5. 

Losing the match brought the 
Tritons to 5-15 in the MPSF and 
effectively shot their chances of 
competing in the postseason tour-
nament. The Tritons’ loss paved the 
way for UCLA to play in the tourna-
ment in their stead.

While their .263 hitting efficien-
cy was far from great, the Tritons 
really lost the game due to too many 
service errors. With 16 errors and 
only one ace, the team could not 
pressure the Matadors and get out 
from under their lead.

“The main thing against 
Northridge was that we missed quite 
a few serves, we had 27 percent ser-
vice errors,” head coach Kevin Ring 
said. “That’s definitely on the high 
side, you want to be below 18 per-
cent. So we just did not make them 
work hard enough to side out. We 

gave them too many easy points.”
Sophomore outside hitter Carl 

Eberts had a good night with 12 
kills, nine digs, an ace and two 
blocks. Junior opposite Shane Veiga 
showed 10 kills and no errors in 
18 swings. Senior middle blocker 
Calvin Ross hit .700 and collect-
ed seven kills with no errors in 
10 swings. Freshman setter Mike 
Brunsting came through again with 
34 assists.

“I thought at times we passed 
pretty well and our offense was OK 
in stretches, but we just did not 
pressure them enough from the ser-
vice line,” Ring said.

UCSD came out strong in the 
match against Cal State Long Beach 
and powered through to win the 
first set 25-17. But Long Beach took 
the next three 25-21, 25-17 and 
25-20 to take the win. Hitting effi-
ciencies were close, with the Tritons 
at .257 and the 49ers at .276. Once 
again, service errors were high for 
UCSD.

“Eighteen errors in four games 
is a little high, but not too bad,” 
Ring said. “But we did better at get-
ting our serves on the right targets. 
We just need to find a way to be 
a little more consistent with our 
offence. We were passing well and 
the strength of our team this year 
has been [balanced] and we need 
to get back to that. We did that a 

couple [times] and we looked good, 
but we need to find more consis-
tency with it.”

Eberts totaled 15 kills, four digs, 
and a block. Freshman outside 
hitter Nick Iorfino got 10 kills, four 
digs and three blocks. Sophomore 
libero Chase Frishman showed a 
team-high nine digs and freshman 
middle blocker Sebastian Brady 
had a career-high seven blocks. 
Brunsting had another big night, 
collecting a career-high 42 assists.

The Tritons will host UC Irvine 
at RIMAC Arena on Saturday, April 
16 at 7 p.m. for the last game of the 
season. The match will also mark 
the last career match for seniors 
Phil Bannan, Joel Davidson, Calvin 
Ross, and Paul Spitsen, and the 
athletes will be honored before the 
match.

“Our match against Irvine will 
be our final regular season match 
and our senior night, so we want 
to go out and be competitive,” Ring 
said. “We are going to continue to 
work this week in practice: We cer-
tainly need to work on that serving, 
our connection, having that balance 
more often. We’ve been able to do 
that this year and we’ve been a really 
strong team, so we just need to get 
that back.”
