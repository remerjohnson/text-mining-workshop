LCiBTA holds 'Out

Students speak out at

Contributing Writer 

Marching into the Price Center 
waving signs and posters, members 
of the Lesbian Gay Bisexual 
Transgender Association rallied on 
May 2 in celebration of "Out and 
Proud" week. 

The rally culminated in an open-
mic ~ rum, in whi h tudents and 
other member of the LGBTA com-
munity spoke out about some of the 
issues they face at U D, and what 
It means to be a part of the LGBTA. 

Although peakers di cussed the 
hardships and harassment they face 
in an Diego, the general nature of 
the rally was one of hope and 
understanding for the future. 

"It' easy to talk about the bad 
experiences," aid one rally partici -
pant, "but Instcad, Ict' talk about 
the good ones." 

Following this mOlto, speakers 
tood up and openly expressed 

their 5exuality, hoping in return to 
cultivate understanding and equali-
ty. It's about being human and 

moving beyond petty differences 
such as race, religion and exuality, 
said one enthusiastic speaker. 

Each student spoke in a manner 
and on a topic that was personal to 
him or herself. One student read a 
poem discu ing the hardships of 
being homo exual in the Latino 
community; another talked about 
the right of gay marriage, while 
another student discussed the is ue 
of gay couples adopting children. 

Many participants also expressed 
love and companion hip ~ r the 
L ,B~ family and encouraged stu-
dents both gay and traight to help 
foster understanding by taking part 
III the gay and lesbian community. 

pcakers were not limited to 
LGBTA members, however. 

everal students tood up and, 
although describing themselves as 
heterosexual, reiterated the impor-
tance of under tanding and caring 
for people regardless of their sexual 
orientation .

Union accepts contract 
C.U.E. will continue bargaining 
By GAELLE FAURE 
Associate News Editor 

After two years of ten e bar-
gaining between the University of 
Cali forma and the oalition of 
University Employees, a contract 
for UC clerical employees was 
agreed upon by the union on April 
3D, the last day for the union to 
decide whether to accept or reject 
the university'S proposal. 

The union's members voted 
1,557 to 831 to accept a contract 
proposed by a state mediator that 
will grant UC clerical workers a 
3.5 percent total increase in wages, 
far below the 15 percent originally 
requested. 

The tentative contract agree-
ment is expected to be ratified by 
both parties this week, and will last 

through 2004. 
Union president Claudia 

Horning said that the union's 
members were not satisfied but 
felt the need to move on at the 
presen t ti me. 

"I personally voted ' No,' but 
I'm not terribly surprised many 
voted 'Yes,'" Horning said . 
"People understand that we're 
going to keep bargaining." 

Areas of the contract that were 
better received by employees than 
the wage increase, according to 
Horning, were imprpvements in 
language regarding health, safety 
and layoffs. 

"My feeling was that this was 
the best we could get, " said Margy 
Wilkinson, the union 's chief nego-
tiator. "However, I think the wage 
offer was really disgraceful and

Volunteer Connection 

coordinates day of events 
By CHRlmNE PM 

Staff Writer 

Despite the heavy rainfall, the 
A.S. Volwlteer Connection and 
other local agencies launched its 
annual Hands on San Diego 
event on May 3, participating at 
desIgnated volunteering projects 
throughout San Diego. 

The projects included food 
packaging for the San Diego 
Food Bank, a U D Fricnds 
Understanding eeds cav-
enger hunt and the preparation 
of flower arrangement ales for 
AIDS re earch. 

Several volunteers were held 
back as 13 events were canceled 
due to the ram, Including the 
Special Olympics, the Track 
and Field Meet, and the Habitat 

for Humanity building project. 
Volunteer Connection 

members noted that unlike pa t 
years when volunteer turnouts 
have been slowly increasing, 
this year wimessed a drop in the 
number of participating volun-
teers due to the bad weather. 

However, this did not deter 
volunteers from devoting a day 
of outreach as they moved onto 
alternate volunteering sites, uch 
as the San Diego Food Bank. For 
the participating snldents, such 
an event could not be missed. 

"I just think that it is really 
rewarding," said Eleanor

Watts disqualified 
for second time EDITORIAL POSITIONS FOR 2003-2004 
WCSC overturns 

dismissal of charges 
learn what it takes to produce the largest publication on campus. 

By STEVEN Win 
Staff Writer 

Election turmoil continues to 
plague Daniel Watts as the Earl 
Warren College Student Council 
overturned a presidential decision 
to reinstate Watts as WCSC presi-
dent after a college judicial board 
disqualified him. 

Watts was elected to be the 
2003 -04 WCSC president on April 
II . A grievance was then filed 
against him by Warren student and 
resident advisor Crystal Kitamura 
regarding alleged illegal campaign-
ing when he endorsed himself on 
his Warren College Television pro-
gram, "Perfect Vision." Aher the 
subsequent hearing, the Warren 
College Judicial Board disqualified 
him from his position on April 18. 

Watts decided to appeal the 
judicial board ruling to the Warren 
College Student Council. After 
reviewing Watts' case, 2002-03 
WCSC President Donald Povieng 
decided to dismiss the charges 
against against Watts on April 30. 

"), as Warren College Student 
Council president, felt that it was the 
right decision at the time," Povieng 
said. ") was trying to be fair.» 

Watts' case did not end there, 
however. On May I , the Warren 
College Student Council decided to 
overturn Povieng's decision. 

"The Council voted unani -

mously to appeal our president'S 
decision to override the judicial 
board in the Kitamurll v . Wlltts 
casc," said 2002-03 Warren junior 
senator and the 2003 -04 vice presi-
dent internal Jessica Kepford. 

Watts expressed his frustration 
with the May I decision. 

"I was disappointed in their 
decision to override the dismissal 
of the ruJing of a biased judicial 
board," Watts said. "I question the 
legality of the whole thing, but I 
am just going to do my best [in the 
future proceedings) and I am confi-
dent that the appeals body will be 
more fair." 

Though their term has now 
expired, the 2002-03 council decid-
ed to extend their voting power 
solely on Watts' case until il is 
resolved and will probably hear the 
case sometime this week. 

Under the WCSC constitution, 
the new council is set to convene 
for their first meeting on May 8 
even though the president position 
remains vacant . 

.. As the new term of WCSC will 
convene [thisl week with no official 
president, I will be fulfilling my 
duties as vice president internal to 
erve as president in the president's 

ab ence for this fir t meeting," 
Kcpford said .

New Israeli~Palestinian peace plan shows promise 
... ... 

Plans for peace between Israelis and the Palestinians may seem like a dime a 
dozen these days. Camp David 
talks, Oslo accords, Mitchell and 
Tenet peace plans - what's 
changed? VVhen reading about the 
violence in the newspapers about 
suicide bombings in Tel Aviv and 
Israeli raids of the Gaza strip, it 
seems like little has. 

But this seeming lack of 
progre s only requires more action ; 
Governments must redouble their 

efforts to stop 
the violence 

that has 
resulted in 

more than 
2 , I 0 0 

Palestinian 
and 700 
Israeli dea ths 
sin c e 
September 

2000 to find new 
paths to peace . 

And the seeds of 
change may be planted 

with an innovative new charter 
released on April 30; the so-called 
"road map" to peace between the 
Palestinians and Israel that pro-

WORLD 
vides security to the Jewish state 
and state boundaries to a newly 
created Palestine. 

The road map plan, named so 
by the media and involved diplo-
mats because it lays out a three-
phase process by which Palestinians 
and Israelis may arrive at a feasible 
resolution, may succeed where oth-
ers have failed for many reasons. 

First and foremost, unlike other 
bargaining processes, the road map 
attempts to side-step immediate 
negotiations between Israelis and 
Palestinians. Past peace talks have 
operated on strict timetables; the 
road map supplements Israeli-
Palestinian negotiations with 
observable, independent and simul-
taneous moves by which each ide 

will achieve their own goals in addi-
tion to rebuilding damaged trust. 
By this innovation, the parties ma y 
overcome the loss of goodwill and 
hope to circumvent the deadlock 
that may occur if bilateral discus-
sions were convened on the heels of 
the past 30 months of violence. 

Renewed trust of Palestinians on 
the part of Israelis, the key to the 
success of any peace plan, may be 
aided by the recent change in 
Palestinian leadership. With a new 
prime minister and cabinet in, new 
seeds of progress may be sown. In 
the J~rus/Jlmt Post, analyst Barry 
Rubin noted that the new prime 
minister of Palestine, Abu M.azen, 
may be in a bener po ition to "chart 
a more conciliatOry course than 
Yasser Arafat." 

Abu Mazen has already stated 
that fonner ractics of terror have 
undermined the Palestinian pur uit

Trip to Derry reveals realities of Irish conflict 
though~ 
over a pint 

Chris Taylor 

I have waited far too long to visit Derry. Due to my academic work, social life, and apprehen-
sion about a nearly nine hour bus 
ride down poorly paved roads, I 
have put off visiting Northern 
Ireland unti l this last week. 

There are many reasons for vis-
iting the North. It is beautiful; it 
cou n ts as an.other coun try on the 
list, and of course, it is famous for 
one of the worlds most watched 
civil rurmoils. Political scientists 
from all over the world flock to 
Northern Ireland to srudy the so-
ca lled "troubles" between the 

arionalist Catholics and the 
Unionist Protestants . 

It is a conflict that most 
Americans know enough about to 
fear (i.e., the Irish Republican 
Army), but not enough to truly 
understand. This is not due to 
sheer ignorance as some might sug-
gest, but the amazing density of the 
problem over an area the size of 
Connecticut. 

Surprisingly, down in Corle, itu-
aced in the southern tip of the 
Republic of Ireland, but yet only a 
few hundred miles away from 
Belfast, the troubles may as well not 
exist. Earlier in the year, when home 
rule in Belfast was rescinded due to 
espionage by the Nationalist politi-
cal party inn Fein, and the scandal 
reached even California's newspa-
pers (albeit 14 or 15 pages in), there 
wasn't a flinch in Cork. Meanwhile, 
in Dubllll and parocularly in Belfast , 
the I fI h prepared for IIlcreased ter-

rarist activity, which thankfully has-
n't occurred as of yet. 

So for all my nine months in 
Ireland, I know pitifi.dly linle about 
the conflict except for the long-
winded material in so many books 
read from the comfort of Cork. 

However, to try to get a better 
look into the troubles, I choose 
Derry rather than Belfast. VVhi le 
Derry has seen more peace than 
Belfast in terms of quantity of vio-
lence, it has been the site of many 
of the most disrurbing and cruel of 
the a troci ties. 

VVhen I arrive, I decide to wan-
der aimlessly with a small, inade-
quate tourist map JUSt to give me a 
hint of where to go. If you trail off 
the beaten path, you are much 
more likely to see things as how 
they really are, rather than the 
tourist or layman political scientist 
viewpoint. 

Then, most importantly, I try to 
forget everything I know about the 
struggle because any bias would 
certainly impede any sort of 
progress; plus, I want to prove to 
my skeptical Irish friends that I 
really do want to understand the 
problem that pervades every part of 
their lives. 

To an American, the issue of 
Nationalist and Unionists in 
Northern Ireland may be construed 
as relatively simple when witnessed 
from such a safe distance. The 
Nationalists want Ireland reunited 
and curse the British for ever set-
ting foot on lri h soil. The 
Unionists consider Northern 
Ireland Briti h, and their loyalties 
hold true even against rising opin-
ion that Ireland should be reunited. 
Ilowever, as any of the Iri h will 
tell you, once you're in these cities, 
the siruation becomes excruciating-
ly complicated . 

And they arc ab olutcly fight. 

Even your preferred choice of 
name for the city identifies you 
with a political side: Derry for 
Nationalists and Londonderry for 
UnioniSts. Merely because I am 
lazy, I always say Derry and hope 
no one thinks I am taking sides. In 
fact, all of Derry emits a haze of 
tension that you cannot place a fin-
ger on. The people, while friendly, 
are definitely less open and talka-
tive than the people of the South . 

This is logical because Derry 
has been home to some of the most 
violent episodes in the troubles, 
including Bloody Sunday, when in 
1972, British soldiers indiscrimi-
nately gunned down 13 civil rights

out is compromise. II 
protesters. Over 30 years later it is 
still a very sensitive subject to dis-
cuss with the Irish living in Derry. 

Then, there are the murals. 
orthern Ireland 's larger cities are 

renowned for their sectarian streets 
and the communities coming to 
together and painting large murals 
on the sides of houses depicting 
political beliefs or recounting the 
past events. As one walks first 
through downtown Derry, which is 
predominantly Catholic, the streets 
are flooded by painted images of 
British soldiers shooting the inno-
cent, praises to IRA leaders and a 
large stone wall that proclaims, 
"You are now entering Free Derry."

ing, oppression and a march toward 
freedom. They are definitely mov-
ing, hut as a skeptic, I attempt to 
resist any emotional involvement in 
the statements of the murals. 

After a long walk across the 
River Foyle, the Protestant area 
opens up. These murals are even 
more patriotic than the 
Nationalist's murals. All of them 
are sarurated by the red, white and 
blue of the British Union Jack, and 
all them proclaim the deeds of 
Ulster Scotch-Irish who became 
leaders around the world, including 
George Washington. But it also 
houses the most startling murals in 
Derry. 

The crea rure originally used on 
the cover of Iron M.aidens single 
liThe Trooper" wears a British uni-
form and is carrying a tattered 
Union Jack while torrning across a 
battleground with dead Iri sh 

ationalists around him. The 
painted banner states that 
Unionists will fight and kill 
Nationalists even if there is only 
one Unionist left alive. The picture 
is haunting and unrepentant. 
However, with the notorious cruel-
ty of the IRA and the number of 
innocent civilians lolled in their 
attacks, it is not terribly difficult to 
see the anger and disgust at the 
Irish ationalists. 

At the same time that the e 
murals unabashedly proclaim very 
harsh stances toward peace, and a 
visitor may be torn between which 
side has more validity, there is also 

peace in the city and the rest of 
Ireland. 

It seems very confusing. Within 
half a mile of this amazing statue 
are some of the most angry state-
ments and slogans I have ever een. 
This is where the true complexities 
of the troubles lie. Most of the Irish 
do want peace very much . 
However, the varying degrees of 
patriotism for the different factions 
always hurts those trying to make 
peace. Even if the great majority 
desires peace, the small plinter 
paramilitary groups have managed 
to ruin most of the progress, 
including the famous Clinton-bro-
kered 1998 peace accords. 

And unfortunately, there is very 
little middle ground, where most of 
the peace process takes plaLe. The 
goverrunent is controlled mostly by 
Unionists and a few extreme 

ationalists from Sinn Fein. Anyone 
straddling the middle is considered a 
traitor to both sides. It is an Issue 
instilled in children at birth, and the 
Irish grow up nearly unquestioning 
in the loyalty to their hemage. 

It was a moving experience, but 
I came no closer to which Side has 
more validity. In the end, the only 
right answer 1 could ec is III mod-
eration. The extremes have pllt

6 OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, MAY S, 2003 

Peace: Plan is jeopardized by lack of trust between sides 
continued from page 4 

Palestinians' demands. 
Further, the road map has been 

developed by not only the United 
tates but also in coordination with 

the European Union, Russia and 
the United ations: the "Quartet." 
While most heavily prepared by 
the nited States, the relative mul-
tilateral dcvelopment of the plan 
may serve to buttress the confi-
dence of nervous Palestinians. 
Many fear the political imbalance, 
ostensibly created by the current 
U .S. occupation ofIraq, will gener-
ate pressure on the Palestinian 
Authority to submit to the 
demands of I rael. 

The vOice of the other nations 
in the construction of the road map 
may serve as a partial counterbal-
ance to fears that the Bush admin-
istranon will not pursue the path to 
peace with the same vigor demon-
strated to the culmination of war. 
British Prime Minister Tony Blair 
III particular, who coupled his sup-
port of the war in Iraq with this 
road map, has already hown his 
determination to keep the peace 
process on track. 

The plan also capitalizes on the 
anti-terrorism tide that has ri en 
with greater resolve throughout 
the world since the Sept. I I terror 
attacks. More parties today are 
openly vested in the fight again t 
terrorism, which may serve to aid 
new leadership in cracking down 
on militant organizations that u e 
terror tactics as bargaining tools. If 
the sentiments of Abu Mazen con-
demning acts of terrorism as 
undermining the quest for 
Palestinian statehood shared at the 
Palestine Legislative Council last 
week are reinforced by other Arab 
states, this could give the weight 
needed to bring an end to terrorist 
acts for political gain in the region. 

Finally, the road map demands 

concessions from both parties: 
Israelis' must withdraw from 
Palestinian lands, while the 
Palestinian government must rein 
in militant organizations charged 
with terrorism. T t also recognizes 
that the end result must provide for 
a Palestinian state. Without these 
key elements, no contract will be 
valid between the two side. 
Without these key elements, it is 
only a matter of time before the 
violence begins anew. 

The phase, broadly construed, 
are Simple. In the first phase, as pre-

" 

the fold of the international com-
munity, including possible U.N . 
membership. 

Phasc three builds on these suc-
cesses and seeks to finalize the 
process. If the Quartet judges the 
timing to be right and the actions 
required of each state to be met, 
then by the end of 2005, a final 
agreement will be reached that 
define the final status of 
Jeru alem, the final borders 
between the two tares and the final 
resolution of whether Palestinians 
may return to their homes in 

Jerusalem lands. 
I [owever, as

cease all terrorist 
attacks as well as

reforms to make

the month of May this year. 

The second phase, oudined to 
start in June 2003, focu es on the 
establishment of a provisional

2003. Tim provisional tate is to be

The Quartet pledges to work to

organizations including Hamas and 
Islamic Jihad, group claiming 
responsibility for systematic terror-
ism against the Israeli state, have 
already announced their oppo ition 
to the plan on the grounds that it

groups were to continue their acts of

the violence by the Palestinians.

ing from the Palestinian camp. 
Jewish leaders in the Sharon gov-
ernment oppose the idea of a 
Palestinian state, much less one 
that asks some Israelis to abandon 
their settlements in Palestinian ter-
ritories. In many ways, both side 
feel like they are giving up too 
much. [n a battle that has been so 
long and hard fought, this isn 't sur-
prising. But if peace is to be 
attained, if a bargain is to be struck, 
both ides must cede to the other in 
a system of contingent exchange. 

There are also fears that the 
inchoate Palestinian leadership 
may not be the force needed to 
bring change. While their security 
forces train to root out anti-Israeli 
terrorist cells in the West Bank, 
many question whether conflicting 
visions for Palestine between 
Arafat and Abu Mazen will sideline 
the peace process. And the conflict 
is not limited to Arafat and Abu 
Mazcn. According to jamil Hamad, 
a West Bank correspondent for 
Timt, notes that of the 24 cabinet 
appointments, Arafat "had a hand 
in choosing 20 ... so the old guard 
are sti ll very strong .. " This fear that 
the Palestinian authority may not 
be united is coupled with the con-
cern of disunity among other Arab 
states. If other Arab states do not 
aid Abu Mazen in his fight against 
terror, funding may continue to 
flow to militant groups. 

Perhaps it is naive to belteve 
that in only a few years the e rwo 
societies will overcome deeplyroot-
ed distrust and hatred. It will cer-
tainly be difficult and demand a 
willingness to negotiate. However, 
the road map provide guideline 
and an observable action proce!>S. 
What some term naivete, others 
call a hopeful step toward a more 
peaceful Middle East. We can 
hardly live with the alternative to 
the struggle for peace.

MONDAY, MAY S, 2003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

C.U.E.: Union split over contract with UC 
continued from page I 

complacenr than they already are 
right now." 

UC spokesman Paul Schwartz 
defended the university's claim, 
citing the university's current 
financial difficulties. 

"When you combine salary 
and benefits, we're matching or 
well beyond those competitors," 
Schwartz said. "But that's a little 
different than points raised in 
negotiations about salaries, 
beca use tha t has to do wi th the 
markct. Given where the market's 
at, we're at or beyond market." 

C.U.E.'s dues-paying members, 
whose number comprises about 
one-third of the 18,000 UC cleri-
cal employees it represents, voted 
on twO different versions of the 
contract. The first proposal on the 
ballot differed from the second in 
that it did not offer merit-step 
increases, which offer employees 
certain salary increases in addition 
to cost of living adjustment 
increases. The latter won by a 
close margin. 

"People were concerned that if 
those merit increases went away, 
we might never get them back," 
Horning said. "We don't trust the 
university to restore them." 

Wilkinson had favored the first 
proposal because, she said, it 
treated all workers the same and 
would cost the university more 
money than the second. 

Had the union voted to turn 
down the proposal, both parties 
would have had to decide whether 

to declare a formal impasse, and 
the union would have had to con-
ti nue wi thou t a contract. The 
union had let its last contract 
expire in November 200 I. 

The union plans to go straight 
back to the bargaining table later 
in the month, where, in addition 
to the bargaining of wages, each 
party is granted an addi tiona I issue 
to discuss. According to 
Wilkinson, the union has not yet 

" People understand that 
we're going to keep 

bargaining. " 
- ClaucfJa Homing, 

C.U.E. President 

chosen what theirs will be. 
"Next to wages, I think the most 

pressing issue will be the increased 
cost of benefits," Wilkinson said. 
"The university's position at this 
point, which is a great concern to 
us, is that increased costs have to be 
passed down to and absorbed by 
clerical workers." 

According to Horning, the 
union now plans on trying to 
increase its membership and to 
pressure the university both within 
individual campuses and through 
wider publicity of labor issues. 

As one bargaining term comes 

to a close and a new one opens, 
many campuses will choose new 
representatives from their local 
C.U.E. chapters to send to the 
bargaining table and decide how 
to work toward their next con-
tract . 

Tensions from the recent 
round of negotiations remain 
fresh for both the union and the 
university, within the past 
months, both parties filing 
charges of bad faith bargaining 
against each other, union mem-
bers striking on five campu es, 
the university attempting to 
declare an impasse and being 
denied, and the union joining the 
San loSt Mercury Nrws in a lawsuit 
against the university. 

Horning expressed the hope 
that UC President Richard C. 
Atkinson would have tried to fix 
these difficulties between the two 
parties before the approaching the 
end of his career. 

"The message is supposed to 
be coming down from the top, 
and we don't think it is," Horning 
said . 

The union has continued to 
claim that the University of 
California has enough money to 
raise workers' wages, while the 
university claims that with budget 
cuts this year, all its money has 
already been allocated. 

Members of the UC lecturers 
union, who joined C.U.E. mem-
bers in the five-campus strike, 
have yet to reach a contract with 
the university.

Group discusses 
Mideast conflict 
Coexistance Through 

Dialogue fosters discussion 
By THOMAS NEELEY 

Senior Staff Writer 

For Israeli Neta Retter and 
Palestinian Ghadeer Tarazi, both 
UC D students, the word "terror-
ism" brings to mind different emo-
tions. 

"Terrorism means I can't go 
home," said Rener, a sophomore at 
Eleanor Roosevelt College. Rener 
moved from Israel when she was 
five years old and used to visit her 
grandfather every summer. Because 
of the recent violence, her grandfa-
ther has told her not to come. 

Similarly, Tarazi, who was born 
in Jerusalem and lived in Ramallah 
through high school, said that 
because of security checkpoints, 
her ability to either enter or leave 
her home in the West Bank is con-
strained. 

"I can't go in, I can't go out -
That's terrorism," said Tarazi, an 
Earl Warren College junior. 

Seeking a common ground, 
Retter and Tarazi were two of 
about 25 participants at the April 
30 meeting of Students for 
Coexistence Through Dialogue, a 
group that seeks to foster discus-
sion among students interested in 
talking about the' Israeli-
Palestinian conflict. 

Zeina Hindiyeh, a Roosevelt 
senior and one of the group's orga-
nizers, said the group was created in 

response to a need for open dialogue 
on the Israeli-Palestiman conflict. 

"We would always see the 
tables on Library Walk," Ilindlyeh 
said. "It was always one side 
against the other, but it was never 
people being able to com municate . 
So we wanted to be able to create a 
space where they could actually 
have those kinds of conven,.wons." 

The idea for the group was 
based on similar dialogue groups 
that meet across the nation and in 
San Diego. At UCSD, the group 
held its first dialogue in winter 
quarter. There have been twO dia-
logue meetings since the first, and 
there are plans for a fourth. 

The meetings are guided by 
several moderators, who insist that 
participants treat the meeting as a 
dialogue rather than as a debate. 

Kaplan, a freshman at ERC, 
said the meetlllgs to date have been 
characteri zed by re pect and 
understanding. 

"For the most parr, people are 
listening and not cutting each 
other off," Kaplan said. "Everyone 
comes a wa y SOrt of frustra ted bu t 
yet feeling really good, because it~ 
a heated issue, but by sharing -
people just feel better at the end." 

For Hindiyeh, the most surpri -
ing characteristic of the dialogue is 
the civility among the parncipants.

Possible merger talks begin 
UC looks into managing Monterey Inst. 

By CHARUE TIAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Univers ity of Califo rni a 
and the Monterey Institute of 
Internationa l Studies have begun 
preliminary talks to incorporate 
the institute into th e UC system. 
If the Monter<.y Institute does 
becomc a part of the university, 
the 48-year-old graduate school 
would be administered as a unit 
of UC Santa Cruz in a simi lar 
manner in which the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography is a 
part ofUCS D. 

De pite the state budget sh ort-
fall, both UC and Monterey 
Institute officials are excited with 
the possibility of the merger. 

"The institute has a unique 
and distinguished history in serv-
ing the nation 's need for gradu-
ates with a wide-ranging perspcc-
tive on issues th at transcend 
national boundaries," said UC 
President Richard C. Atkinson in 
an April 28 statement. "The 
University of California i plea ed 
to explore this possibility as a 
means of enhancing its abi lities to 
serve the state of California and 
the nation." 

The Monterey Institute spe-
cializes in international studie and 
offers several graduate degrees 
that focus on foreign policy, diplo-
macy and international bu iness. 

"We're a small , specialized 
graduate program in international 
affairs and there's a couple of 
things that we bring that the uni -
ver ity doesn't have. One is a mas-
ters program in translation and 
interpretation and the second one 
is our Center for Nonproliferation 

Studies," said Monterey lnstitute 
President C het Haskell. 

The addition of the Center for 
onproliferation Studies would 

be a significant addition to the 
university if the merger were to 
occur. T he CNS is the largest 
nongovernmental organization in 
the world devoted to curbing the 
spread of weapons of mass 
destruction and is the only gradu-
ate research center that focuses on 
nonproliferation policy. 

" The institute has a 
unique and distinguished 

history in serving the 
nation IS need for 

graduates with a wide~ 
ranging perspective on 
issues that transcend. 
nntianal boundaries. 

- Richard C. Atkinson, 
uc President 

No timeline for the merger has 
been set and many academic and 
financial issues have yet to be 
resolved. Both UC and Monterey 
Instirute officials will begin talks 
to reach a memorandum of under-
standing. 

Officials are also aware of state 
budget difficulties, but are stating 
that discussion would be tOO early 
to have any details on an imple-

mentation pl an . 
Another issue that would be 

addressed is the tuition disparity 
between the two academic institu-
tions. Unlike the University of 
California, the Monterey rnstinlle 
is a private institution and has an 
annual graduate l1Iition of $22, 180. 

"For California residents, the 
[tuition] difference would be sig-
ni ficantly diffe rent ... But it's spec-
ulation right now how the acrual 
numbers would be, we ' re still 
working on that," Ilaskell said. 

With the current financial 
shortfall, funding for the pro-
posed merger is a concern that 
UC officials are looking at. 

"One of the things that we're 
also keenly aware of is the fact that 
if and when the instirute were to 
be incorporated into UC, we 
would need state funding for an 
enrollment increase of approxi-
mately 700 students," said UC 
spokesperson Chuck McFadden. 
" It may be that by the time the 
affiliation becomes final - if it 
ever does become final - the state 
might be in a better fisca l si tuation 
than it is right now." 

However, both parties remain 
optimistic that these differences 
and concerns will be solved 
through discussions. 

"There are a number of inter-
esting institutional arrangements 
like the Hastings School of Law 
and the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography," Haskell said. 
"The intention here is that while 
the institute would be adminis-
tered on behalf of the university 
by UCSC, it would be for the ben-
efit of the entire university sys-
tem."

it' really important to step outside 
yourself and focu on other people. 
It's just exciting to see your effect on 
someone else when you volunteer." 

Vince Pascual , an Earl Warren 
College freshman, commented on 
his and his friends' obligation to go 
Out to projects for volunteer work. 

"We've been so lazy lately, it just 
comes to a point when we all need 
to go out and volunteer," Pascual 
said . 

According to Volunteer 
Connection members, the even t 
took nearly three months in plan-
ning. Numerous phone calls were 
made to accumulate the various 
agencies and efforts were made to 
extend their budget and propose T-

shirt donations for the volunteers. 
Hands on San Diego was fir t 

established in 1991, with a purpose 
to join the UCSD community with 
other local volunteering services in 
participating in community projects. 

The Passport to Leadership pro-

Leadership Opportunities was 
involved with I rands on an Diego

Before each group set out for

"You have to change people one 
person at a time," said Eleanor 
Roosevelt College junior Nik Hay. 
'' In terms of the audience ... you see 
people who respond, who are clap-
ping, and that 's what is important." 

Hay, however, along with other 
students, noted that some people 
seemed to be afraid of making eye 
contact with rally participants on 
Library Walk, or appeared general-
ly apathetic to the siruation. 

"Its not a disease," Hay said. 

"You can't catch it." 
In respon e to the rally, 

Assistant Director of the LGBT 
Resource Office Debbie Blake 
commented on the courage of the 
rally speakers. 

" I'm continually amazed at the 
bravery of the people who share 
such personal information to bring 
us together," Blake said. " I lust 
hope that somewhere we conveyed 
how important thiS was to us." 

The LGBTA IS now widely 
becoming known as the 
LGBTQIA. The "Q" and "I" have 
been added to the organizaoon's 
name to include both "queer" and 
"intersex" individuals.

New registration process creates issues for 
select foreign students studying in America 

U nder a new federal man-date; all International stu-dents in the United States 
must rcgister by ug. I in a Web-
based studen t tracking sys tem, 

EVl ,or tudent and Visitor 
I nformJnon System, in order to 
maintain lawful status . 

Earlier registra tion is requlrcd 
for illlcrnatlOnal students gOlllg

United tates. The government is 
able to keep track of all the for -
eign exchange students anending 
universi ties around the country 
with thi s universa l "Veb-based 
system. 

Government-required data on 
international students from the 
U SO International Student and 
Scholar ffice i uploaded into a 
SE IS compliant software pro-
gram and then sent to the Web-
ba ed SEVTS, where, in theory, all 
governmental and educational 
institutions can have access to the 
same information. 

"Since January I , when UC D 
became a SEVTS-approved Insoru-
tion, we have been entering stu-
dents and advising them of the 
new rules," aid KHn Jackson , 
associate adviser for the 
Internauonal Center.

current II1forlllalion, updating any

UCSD Education Abroad 
Program student from King's 
College in London . Baradari i not 
a citizen of Iran. 

According to what is stated in 
a U.S . federal mandate, any for -
eign national who came to the 
United States on or before the 
Sept. 30, 2002, deadline does not 
have to register under SEER 
Baradari came shortly after that 
date. 

Before leaving o n a 10-day 
backpacking trip to Mexico, 
Baradari veri tied with I SO that 
he (ltd no t have to register. pon 
his return at the U.S.lMexico bor-
der, I 5 officials detained him, 
handcuffed him and reqUIred that

"They told me that the univer-
sity had lied to me, that I had to

The INS later mformed 
Baradari that official s at the border 
hJd made a mistake. BaradJrl Ius

"The questions they asked me 
were inform ation that the 
Department of J usrice already has. 
They are on my f - I Vlsa . But the 
IN told me they did not have 
acces to the Department of 
Justice. " 

The UCSD Inrernauonal cen-
ter fully supportS Baradan . 

"The Incident With Borzo 
[Baradan] IS J good example uf 
how new regulations arc rushed 
Into Without careful thought and 
consider,llIon," J dckson said. 

" They told me that the 
university had lied to me I

ccordlJ1g to Jackson, there 
are two types of issue that face 
international srudenrs. One rype 
is gClling a slUdelll visa to srud) 
in the United tares. The econd 
rype is maintaining lawful status. 
Last fall, UCSD had only a hand -
ful of problems of the first type 
With vISa delays and denials . For 
the second type, the student 
needs to notify IS 0 of Jny 
changes III address, major, full-
time status, and amount and 
source of fund lllg. International 
studen ts need to state their source 
of funding, who their sponsor are 
and have at least a required 
amount of money in the bank to 
pay for tui tion. 

"Les than I percent of our Stu-
dents have problems maintaining 
legal status," Jackson said . 

Students who have fallen out of 
Status with IS O's guidance can 
apply for reinstatement to status at 
the local I office. 

ot all international students 
have been greatly affected 
by the e new 
policies. 

Kinuko Kanda, a UCSD inter-
national student majoring 111 polit-
ical science, said, "Since I am 
Japanese, and Japan is not J target 
of NSEER, I don't feel 
like thll1gs changed much around

Baradan however, quc,tlOn,

Baradari said . "It is also only the

The new 'E\-1 poltq: IS of lIt-
tle concern to those Internltlon.ll 
students who Jre not from tJr!!et-

Joe Chan, a L' SD II1tcrna-
tiOlul student from Hong Kong, 
said, " 0 far I haven't gonen IIlto 
any trouble becau e of the new 
policy, but I feel the government IS 
being more cautious [with] Inter-

The people and environment 
of the United tate attracted

THE UCSD GUARDIA MONDAY, MAY 5, 2003 

Volunteers give back 
Support given for Hands on SD 
By NOREEN THAM 

Staff Writer 

Lending meir hands and opening 
meir hearts, voluntecrs including 
UCSD tudents, staff and organiza-
tion collaborated on April 26 for 
Hands 011 an Diego, an effort to 
improve and unite me San Diego 
community. 

Hands 011 San Diego is an annu-
al cvent mal gives me UCSD com-
munity a chance to participate in a 
variety of volunteer projects. The 
goal of I lands on San Diego i to 
inspire me UCSD and San Diego 
community to become more 
involved in local social services and 
to gain a better understanding of 
the community issucs mat a ffcct 
cveryone. 

Bccause me event is only a onc-
day commitment, students are 
givcn the chance to break away 
from me busy schedule of classes 
and work and simply give back to 
me community they live in . 

"Since students and other mem-
bers of me UCSD community can 
become quite busy during the 
week, Hands on an Diego is a 
chance for mem to take only one 
day to give back and make that 
connection wim the community," 
said Volunteer Connection staff 
member Emily Lee. 

Each year since 1991 , a diversi-
ty of projccts is organized for each 
event to give participants a chance 
to choose the issue or project thcy 
wish to work on. 

"There are always many diverse 
opportunities for the students and 
staff members of UCSD to partici-
pate in," said special projects direc-
tor Jannet Olague. 

Some opportunities Olague 
spoke of for this year were a track 
meet for Special OlympiCS and the 
Rainbow Organic Gardens, which 
provided the opportunity for vol-
unteers to participate as hosts and 
ho tesses for a group of cancer 
patients in a farm tour and an 
organic luncheon. Anomer event 
was PUt on by HabItat for 
Humanity to construct a building 
on Van Dyke Street. 

The vanery of projects help 
participants find something they 
Wll1 enjoy doing. 

"r\ lot of people are discouraged 
from volunteering many times 
because mey feel obligated to make 
a whole year or quarter commit-
ment to something mat mey may 
not enjoy," Lee said. "Hands on 

San Diego is only one day, plus 
they get to choose whichever pro-
ject fits their interests." 

Along wim me chance to help 
the communiry, participants often 
discover other benefits to volun-
teering. 

"Many mings can be gained 
from participating, like a feeling of 
gratification, a new friend or a new 
perspective of the world around 
you," Olague said. "It can be a fun 
distraction from midterms or a 
newfound passion. And an added 

" Many things can be 
gained, like a feeling of 

gratification, a new friend 
ar a new perspective. 

-Jillneto., 
Volunteer Connection 

" 

bonus is that Hand On is so much 
fun!" 

Fun a it may be, Hands on San 
Diego is not an event that comes 
wim little preparation. 

"We had to divide me work into 
four committees," Olague said . 
"Agencic [commIttee) contacted 
communiry agencies, Donations 
[committee) collected donated food, 
Publiclry [committee) spread the 
word, and Entertainment [commit-
tee] organized the entertainment 
and the keynote speaker. The entire 
Volunteer Connection office is 

Kenrick Leung/Guardian 

involved in this process, 0 it hasn't 
been a one-man how. There were 
few problems, and if anything, work-
ing rogemer has been a high pomt 
since it's almo t me end of me year 
and we have all come to be very 
good friends wim one anomer." 

As head of the project, Olague 
herself gained valuable lessons 
from participaong. 

"I realized what my limitations 
are, improved my communication 
skills by at least SO percent. and if 
mere were ever any ounce of shyness 
in me, it is now gone. I also realized 
me meaning of teamwork," she said. 

This one-day even't also give 
participants a chance to become 
committed to a cause for a longer 
period of time. 

"Since this event brings out so 
many different agencies, partici-
pants have the chance to find one 
mey want to become committed to. 
They can men later contact these 
community agencies and ask for 
ways they can continue to help," 
Lee said. 

Hands on an Diego not only 
brings togemer me UCSD com-
munity, but also the entire San 
Diego communiry. 

"We always get a large number of 
participants," Olague said. "Resident 
advisers tend to participate with 
meir residents, and UCSD clubs 
participate wim meir members. We 
usually have an Diego Rescue 
MIssion, Western Service Worker , 

an Diego Graffiti Control, 
Fraternity House, San Diego Food 
Bank, an Diego Audubon Society,

emertainment after the proJects. 
This year's keynote speaker was 
Michael Schudson , Director of 
UCSD Civic Collaborative. 

Judging from previous yea rs, 
lland on San Diego has proven to 
be a success. 

"Looki ng at notes from what 
other directors before me have 
written, I can say that it has becn a 
very gratifying experience for both 
the volunteers and the staff mem-
bers. The volunteers seem to like 
thc projects a lot and always come 
back wi th fun stories about their 
projects . If we do get complaints, 
it's usually concerning lack of Slm-
tan lotion ," Olague said . 

"This event helped me rcmem-
ber why 1 love people so much," 
Olague said. "Books can only take 
one so far. The rest has to be taught 
by one's own experience.~."

Interviews by Barri Worth, photos by Rachel Garcia 

"I prefer off campus 
because it actually 

makes me go to cia 
more since I feel like 
home and school are 

separate." 

Jessica Arine, 
Rtll~/I~ junior 

"Off campus because 
there's more room; 

it's less claustropho-
bic and more casu-

al." 

Jordan Holbrook, 
Roos~II~1t sophomol't 

"As a first year, I've 
only lived on cam-
pus. It eems conve-

nient in terms of 
parking, but in terms 
of freedom, I'd defi-
nitely prefer to live 

off campus." 

Natasha Wilder, 
Muir frrshmon 

"Off campus because 
there's no real life 

on campus; if there 
were, I'd prefer to 
live on campus." 

Shoshana Seidman, 
Roos~lIelt sophomore 

"Off campu~ because 
there are no Os, 
and you can't get 

kicked out." 

Eric Woods, 
Warren s~nior 

"I preferred to live on 
campus a an under-
grad becau e it's cool 
to meet people in the 
donns with constant 
activities, but as a 

grad sruJenr, I ·tudy 
too much I prefer 
to live off campus."

quote 
UP AlE 

These Thursday morning foot 
soldiers walk amongst the rest of 
you each day. Disguised as 
ordinary mortals, few Tritons are 

aware of the bizarre sacrifices they have made to 
win cash & prizes from the G . 
After rising in the wee hours to check the on-line 
Thursday edition, they qUickly realize that would 
be like cheating . So, using eerie powers of restraint, 
they don't look at the movie quote which their 
training has told them resides on the bottom of 
the Classifieds page. They hit the sack and dream 
of their Thursday morn ing assault. Most likely, 
they act as if 
they' re reading 
the Reader at the 

Grove. But their coffee hasn't been 
touched . Beady little eyeholes have been cut through 
all 600 pages as they spy the Guardian delivery area 
in the parking lot below. Victory will mean enough 
cash for 30 minutes on the meters, maybe twice that. 
They know the Eucalyptus leaves provide the best 
cover as they make their approach to the fresh stack 
of Guardians. Although the driver has never admitted 
it, we're certain he's been immobilized several 
times. He probably can't remember ... 

DISREGARD the 
speculative ranting abovel This is the Ad 
Mgr. I am not aware of any such activity or 
operations. Nor would I be disposed to discuss 
such operations, if they d id in fact exist, sir. Let's 
just congratulate these perfectly ordinary students 
and move on . What?

Softball: Tritons end 2003 
season with a 24.,32 record 

cominued from page 20 
the top of the first inning off 
UCSD pitcher Stephanie Kurz en 
route to an 11 -3 victory. The 
Tritons tried to hang with the 
'Runners with a run in the first 
inning and two in the second, but 
the visitors had two-run innings in 
both the second and third frame to 
pull away. 

First baseman Jamie Hurst led 
the Tritons in the game, going 2-} 
with a double. 

Roadrunners' first baseman 
Amber Mi"s put the game out of 
reach when she crushed a three-
run home run in the sixth inning,

her ninth of the season. 
In the second half of the twin-

bill, the visiting Roadrunners again 
jumped out to an early lead and 
never looked back, scoring two 
runs in the top of the first and 
pulling ahead for a 6-2 win. 

Hurst again led the Tritons, 
going 1-3 with an RBI against CSU 
Bakersfield freshman pitcher 
Christie Hill, who pitched a com-
plete game giving up only three 
hits and one earned run. 

With the losses, the Tritons 
finish their season with a record of 
24-32 overall, 13 - 19 in confer-

Tennis: UCSD loses to 
Hawaii Pacific 7., 1 at home 

continued from page 20 
nail biter and they all battled 
hard despite the pressure, play-
ing with a lot of heart and 
courage. Although they lost 
(except for Emil ovak who did 
not finish), the Tritons did not 
eaSily hand the win over, forcing 
three sets in these remaining 
matches. 

"lIn singles), we played hard, 
all of us," Tommy Novak said. 
"We lost the first set in five our of 
the six matches and won the sec-
ond set in four out of the six 
matches. You really can't ask for 
much more ... my brother was 
down, [Trebler) was serving for 
the match 5-4 [in the second set), 
and [Emil) played incredible to 
win 7-5 ... Bryan and Mike, [both 
were) playing guys who were 
really good and they fought 
hard." 

Steidlmayer expressed a simj-
lar sentiment. 

"In singles I thought we com-
peted hard . All the b'tJy~ were giv-
ing everything they've gOt and 
that team is just better. It's always 
tough for me because I think the 
guys give a great effort all the 
time and it's hard when you lose," 
Steldlmaver said. 

Even though Lhey are devastat-
ed by their loss, the Tritons know 
they had a good season, having 
accomplished many goals. The 
Triton have put UCSD on the 
map with a top- 15 ranking, a clean 
sweep of the Californja Collegiate 
Athletic Association team and 
solid play against the top-ranking 
schools in DiviSIOn n. 

"We did accomplish a lot, 
beat a lot of good team , [got a

Novak said. "(It isl e pecially

Despite the loss, rhe freshman 
Novak is optimistic about next 
eason."We'll be better next year, 

that's for sure. I'm looking for-

point). UCSD men~ tennis is lucky 
to have Novak's ability on the team, 
but he~ gOt a little bit to learn. 
Maybe he can take some advice from 
former professional player Jim 
Courier. 

"SportSmanship ... is when a 
guy walks off the court and you 
really can't tell whether he won or 
lost, when he carries himself with 
pride either way," Courier once 
said. 

Technically, ovak neither won 
nor lost; the match did not finish 
before Novak retired in the middle 
of the third set, which was tied 2-2 
at the time. But the way he played 
the game (losing his pride and dig-
nity) definitely looked like ovak 
was suffering the worst loss in col-
legiate tennis.

UCSD men's tennis suffers a heartbreaker' 
Tritons fall to Hawaii Pacific in NCAA Regionals 

By CYNTHIA CHAVEZ 
Staff Writer 

Despite hope to even the score 
from last year's playoff loss, the 
UC D men's tennis team suffered 
a heartbreaking defeat to Hawaii 
Pacific University, 7-1, in the 
Division II ational Collegiate 
Athletic As ociation Regionals on 
May 3. 

"They are probably the best 
team we've played all year ... 
everyone fought pretty hard but 
the e guys are just too good. We 
competed well ; we gOt in those 
third sets," said UC D assi tant 
coach eth Mikkelson. 

The match drew a large and 
energetic crowd although a heavy 
storm delayed the match for 
almo t five hour . Despite home-
court advantage and soIJd play, the 

ea Warnors proved to be tOO 
good for the Tritons that day. 

UC D had a tall order on their 
hands, contending with four of the 
six HP players who ranked in the 
top 40, nationally. It was also chal-
lenging due to the fact that UCSD 
was playing a team of older, more 
profeSSIOnally experienced players 
on athletic scholarships like 
Mikael Maatta, who is ranked o. 
7 in the nation in Singles and o. 
9 in doubles. 

eelang to take an early lead 
in the match, the Tritons strug-
gled through doubles play and 
ended up behind In the match . At 

o. 3, seniors 1ike Meyer and 
Sean agel played one of their 
best doubles matches of the sea-
on, crushing HPU's Milo 

Kopnvlca and asa Pirc -2 for 
the lone UCSD victOry. o. 1 
and o. 2 doubles were very 
close and the matches could have 

gone either way, but the Sea 
Warriors pulled away and won 
them, taking early advantage. 

"I think we could've played 
better for sure [in doubles)," said 
UC D head coach Eric 
Steidlmayer. "I think there was 
some chances in o. 1 doubles all 
day, I think we had five or six break 
points we didn't convert and if we 
won two of those, we would've 
won that match pretty easily. And 
at No.2 doubles, we didn't play to 
the ability that we could and know 
we have but that happen some-
times. I thought our o. 3 team 
played a hell of a match, so I was 
really happy for them. Both my 
eniors on the team - the only 
eniors - played a tremendous 

match." 
The Tritons came out looking 

nervous and cautious at the begin-
mng. 

"We came out nervous, espe-
cially Jeff and I," aid UCSD 
freshman Tommy ovak. "We 
fought hard to the end; we played 
down the whole match and tried to 
keep fighting. We weren't able to 
find our good rhythm at all. 
[Losing the doubles match) made 
it a lot harder from a mental tand-
point because Jeff would've been a 
lot more confident, and [Trebler) 
who played my brother would've 
been a lot less confident and [BIas] 
would've been a lot less confident. 
So, it's bard when you're [down 2-
1) like thaL" 

Despite a 2- 1 deficit, the 
Tritons took the courts for sin-
gle hoping to fare better. 
However, the Tritons found 
themselves playing with their 
backs against the wall a two 
matches ended early with junior

UCSD competed in a two-
game series with CSU Dominguez 
Hills on May 2, losmg the first 
same by a score of 3-2 but coming 
back to take the second game in a 
2 - I victory. 

Freshman staner Stephanie 
Kun threw a complete pme. But 

despite putting together a strong 
performance, she still ended up 
talOng the loss, her 10th of the sea-
son, which put her record at 10-
lD. 

·Stephanie did a great job in 
the first game," aid UCSD head 
coach Patti Gerckens. ·She just 
gave up one big hit." 

The Tritons were quick to put 
some runs on the board, scoring 

tWice in the first inning with 
juniors Amy Mettee and Jodie 
Bland cros tng the plate. 
Sophomore Jamie Ilurst and 
freshman Desiree Franciscus 
knocked them in, and UCSD's 
defense held the Toros scoreless 
for thcee innings. 

In the fourth inning, 
Dominguez Hi lls' Renee Snyder 
helped propel the Toros to their 3-

2 lead and eventual Wtn with a 
two-run triple. 

"We came out right away and 
got two runs in the first inning, 
which was great," Gerckens said. 
"They just got a few runs in the 
fourth inning, and we couldn't 
come back." 

In the second game again t 
Domtnguez Hills, Bland threw 
seven innings of one-run ball, and 
earned the win, her seventh of the 
sea on. 

"Jodie did awesome for us in 
the second game," Gcrckens said. 

Going into the bottom of the 
seventh, UC D was losing 1-0, 
but with one out, junior Kim 
Aggabao and Franciscus both got 
base hits. Freshman Jennifer 
Leonard then came up to the plate 
and knocked both teammates in 
with a two-run walk-off double for 
the victory. 

"We had a great finish to the 
econd game, it was really excit-

mg. It was great how they didn't 
give up. It was just a lot of fun," 
Gerckens aid. 

On May 4, UCSD finished 
their season at home against 13th-
ranked CSU Bakersfield, losing 
both games of a Sunday double-
header. 

The Roadrunners got off to a 
quick start, scoring thcee times in

Y Ou may have heard people around a sporting event say, "It's not whether you win or 
lose, but it's how you play the 
game." This might be said to the 
losing ide to ease the disappoint-
ment and to encourage a level or 
pride, or it might be said to the 
winners in order to remind them to 
win with dignity. . 

1 watched the UCSD men's ten-
nis team play host to Hawaii Pacific 
University in the NCAA Regional 
playoffs on May 3. I got to the 
Northview Tennis Courts right after 
the Tritons dropped two-of-three 
doubles matches and JUSt as singles 
play began. I sat in the stands and 
watched UCSD' Mike Meyer, Emil 

ovak and Jeff Wil on play against 
their IIPU counterpartS on the 
north set of tenni courts. 

[ aw Meyer battle against a 
hard-hitting, professional-like ten-
nis player in Gabor Jaross. Meyer'S 
chances in winning a pOint for 
U D looked di mal, but he found 
a rhythm and began eAchanl,,,ng 
cri p shots with Jaross while talang 
the econd set. Meyer continued to 
match the strong play of Jaross in 
the third, but he fell 6-4. 

On Wilson's court, the score 
indicated him leading 5-1 in the 
third set of his match, but that 
score was not updated until his 
opponent Milo Koprivica, evened 
the set at 5-5. Wil on, who eemed 
to be breezing through his match 
and assuring the Tritons of a point, 
ju t couldn't put Koprivica away, 
and eventually lost 7 -6. 

However, the Novak match 
drew most of my attention (as well 
as the attention of many of the 
other spectators). Novak's effort 
could not be doubted , as he wa 
obVIOusly hurting whde running to 
all four corners of his side of the 
court, returning the shots of Jan 
Tribler. After needing help from 
the athletic trainer, Novak still 
managed to force a thml set by tak-
ing the second, 7-5. 

But the manner III which Novak 
carried himself on the court should 
be questioned. As the match 
reached the second et, ovak 
looked as if he was acting out a dra-
matic theatrical scene after each 
point, wallOng (flaillllg might be a 
bener word) a if he were made of 
Jell- and yelling words of di con-
tent as he made hi way back to the 
baseline. It looked to me like 
Tribler wasn't beaong Novak as 
much as Novak was beating him-
self - pounding his fist onto the 
court several time and dragging 
his feet and body as if he were 
stranded in the middle of a desert 
without any sign of water. It hurt to 
even watch him play. 

Although he played a courageous 
match and gal into his opponent's 
head with his coun demeanor, his 
antics showed a bit of poor ports-
manship. I don't remember one time 
where Novak actually walked back 
to his baseline after a point like one 
of his teammates would (and il did-
n't matter if Novak won or lost the
