UCR Refuses 
Women's Studies 
RI ER IDE - A proposal for 
a Women's Studie Depart-
ment at UC Riverside was 
denied approval by UCR' 

cademic Senate. One of the 
reasons the Advisory Commit-
tee may not have approved 
Women 's Studies i becau 'c 
the program doesn't have any 
full-time fa ully members and 
recruitment i difficult without 
money and status, acco:-ding to 
Irma Kemp, as i lant chair of 
Women 's Studies at UCR.

changing the decision.

Crippled by 
AGSE Strike 
LABOR: UCSD graduate student 
employee union pickets in solidarity 
with UeB graduate student strike 
By Krista Carpenter 
Staff Writer 

UC Berkeley ground to a halt Thursday after 
the Association of Graduate Student Employees 
(AGSE) went on strike. At UCSD, the Associa-
tion of Student Employees (ASE) demonstrated 
their solidarity with Berkeley trikers with picket 
lines at university entrances. 

The Berkeley strike had originally been called 
for Tuesday but was postponed 48 hours while 
last-minute negotiation took place. Both the 
UCB administration and the AGSE now blame 
each other for the breakdown in talks. 

AGSE wants the UC administration to recog-
nize their labor union, made up of Teaching 
Assistants (T As) and Re earch Assistants (RAs), 
so that graduate student employees may collec-
tively negotiate contract to protect what they 
consider to be their rights as university employ-
ees.

AGSE Spokesperson and Executive Board 
member Judith Bienwener e timated the strike 
shut down 70 percent of Thursday 's scheduled 
classes. 

Berkeley Public In formation Spokesperson 
Bob Sanders disputed that claim, say ing that 
approximately 85 percent of scheduled cia ses 

met. 
"Although a lot of undergraduates did not 

show up for class, they are expected to attend, and 
are responsible for their classes," Sanders saiu. 

He added that on Friday he judged there to be 
haJf as many picketers on line as demon~tr.lted 
Thursday, and that Sproul Plaza, the center of 
student activi ty, was just as crowded as u~ual.

Rally Airs Students~ Rape Fears 
By Karen Cheng 
Associate News Editor 

Student rallied at the Hump last Thursday to 
urge women to "take back the night," following 
the Nov, 9 rape of a woman jogging on Gilman 
Drive. 

The rally was partially sponsored by the 
Women 's Resource Center (WRC). Muir junior 
Michael Oshman, who led the rally, said that the 
gathering wa in part to speak out for that anony-
mous woman and on the issue of rape in general. 

" If somebody in our society is violated, weare 
all violated ... that' s why we are here today, to 
how it's not acceptable [and] that we wi ll not 
tand for it. We are here to say that this will not 

go unnoticed," he said. 
Muirsenior Lisa Ro~en explained that !>ociety 

is panly to blame for problems such as rape and 

other sexual assaults. 
" It i crucial to understand the ways in which 

violence and inequality are built into the 'normal' 
relations between men and women. Men are sti ll 
expected to make all the sexual advances and 
women to receive them," she said. 

Rosen continued to explain that the complexi-
ties ulTounding the nature of date rape are not 
black and white. 

"Women are supposed to filld it 'exy to be 
overpowered. We are also educated to think of 
men as uncontrolled and sexually voracious and 
women as mere receiver of their advance~. 
Sexual violence in thi light ha., to be seen 'L" 
natural and inevitable, rather than as a product of 
institutionalized male domination," Rosen said. 

Many female students expressed fear and

looked at the uni -

system ... each little

that the univer:. ity. 
which re cives 10 percent of all 
federal research money granted to 
U.S. colleges. was more centered 
on olving everyday problems than 

~hc had th ught. " rt did 'cern like

Roether said that the $45 cloth-

but "really for the whole country." 

" We wanted to do a book about

Although there 
wasan :lllempt to giveeverycampus 
n largenumberofphotograph ,some 
campu es received les recognition 
then others. Among them was 
UCSD, which only had about 10 
photographs depicting its campu . 

" We had a 101 of pre ure from 
the university to make sure each 
can,pu was equally repre ented, 
and even though we tried our be. t to 
do that.ultimately it hadto be a book 
that de ribed the whole, that de-

Roethersaid that while she hopes 
that the book will help people to see 
the university in a new light, she is 
"a little worried that it will get pi-
geonholed as a ort of fluff piece 
about the university, which is really 
unfortunate because it really is not 
that at all." 

Roether also cautioned people 
looking through the book to " look

IR/PS'. Kor .... aclftc Propam 
Receives $159,000 In Grants 

The KoreaPaciflC Program at the Graduate School of 
International Relations and PacifIC Studies (I RIPS) has 
received two new grants totaling $159,000 to support a 
major two-year project on Korean unification. 

The grants, $44,000 from the Rockefeller Brothers 
Fund and $115,000 from the luce Foundation, will 
support a major research project on the prospects of 
unifICation between North and South Korea, pelhaps the 
most critical issue now facing Korea. The project will 
include a series of seminars, the development of re-
search papers and guest lecturers. 

According to lawrence Krause, director of the IRIPS 
Kore&Pacific Program and an economist whose re-
search focuses on the economic and trade relations of 
Pacific Rim countries, the emergence of South Korea as 
a major competitor in the intemational marketplace has 
left educators, policy analysts and intemational manag. 
ers with a need to understand Korea as a unique country 
and as an important force in worid trade. IRIPS's Kore& 

PacifIC Studies Program was established in 1989 to 
meet this need.

Forum Addresses the Life of Malcolm X 
By Billy Hwanc 
Staff Writer 

Student and members of the 
urroundingcommunity gathered in 

the Price Center Ballroom last TIlurs-
day evening to leam about Malcolm 
X, one of the most controversial 
figure in American history. 

A seminar entitled "Malcolm X: 
Dispelling the Myth," ponsored by 
the Muslim Student Association and 
the African-American Student 
Union, was held to give people a 
better understanding of who 
Malcolm X was and what he be-
lieved. 

Included in the seminar was a 
documentary film, two guest speak-
ers. and a panel discussion. 

The documentary hown wa 
entitled, "El Hajj Malik EIShabazz," 
which tmced Malcolm X 's life from 
his years of crime to his rise as a 
leader in the civil rights movement 
in the 1960s. It chronicled his con-
version to the Nation of Islam, hi 
pilgrimage to Mecca, hi departure 
from the Black Mu Iirns and his 
assa ination. 

The first speaker was fonner 
UCSD profes or Phil Gasper, who 
spoke on "The Political Legacy of 
Malcolm Shabazz and His Rel -
evance Today." 

Gasper suggested reasons for 
Malcolm X's importance in history. 

"What was distinctive about him 
was hi view of the world [and how 
it turned) racism upon its head," 
Gasper said. " He struck fear in the 
American establi hment [during] his 
lifetime,andcontinue todo so[even 
today}." 

" Malcolm was of the opinion 

A P P A 

that what's important is not getting 
black politicians into the corridors 
of power ... but mobilizing [the) 
struggle from below." Gasper ex-
plained. 

Gasper also pointed ou t the way 
in which Malcolm XÂ· life could 
have an impact on today's society. 
"I really think. that perhaps the be t 
way [to continue the struggle) that 
he was involved in is to get involved 
in trying to build that kind of move-
ment in the United States [today). 
We need it more than ever and 1 
think we can draw from the idea, the 
example, the inspiration that he' 
left us with, [and u e it] to fight 
against racism today." 

The second guest spe:tIcer wa 
Karim Akbar, a Mu lim. who poke 
about the " Search for rdentity" and 
thenegativityoftheAflican-Ameri-
can identity. 

"Slavery in America reduced the 
African-American below the level 
ofacommonanimal. .. a weexam-
ine lavery we will find that the 
African-American was taught to hate 
himself," Akbar sa id. " We'vebeen 
identified a inferior. We were com-
fonable with being inferior." 

Akbar stressed the imponance 
of po itive indiViduality that Afri -
can-Americans need to look for and 
should strive to achieve. 

" Malcolm represents the evolu-
tion of the consciousness of a hu-
man being. Malcolm came off the 
streets. He wasn't college-bound. 
Malcolm representt'd the revolution 
ofa psyche that was onceen laved," 
Akbar added. 

The two lectures were followed 
by a panel discu ion in which audi-

ence members were given the op-
portunity to talk with panel mem-
bers about Malcolm X . The panel 
included Akbar, Gasper. and three 
other members from both MSA and 
AASU. 

Question were asked about 
Malcolm X . the religion of Islam, 
the belief Malcolm X had about 
revolution, and the character of the 
man himself. 

While audien e members ap-
peared eager to learn more about 
Malcolm X. some left with more 
que tion than they had when they 
came. 

"Of all the things I've heard about 
him, I still don 't understand what he 
had to say." said Re elle ~ophoÂ­
more Bryan Miller. "I think that 
understanding him is imponant in 
understanding the world today." he 
said. 

Some of those who disagreed 
wi th Malcolm X altcnded the semi-

Muir College Senior Catherine 
Turley said, " At this point. I don 't 
agree with much of what Malcolm 
X stood for, but I want to under-
stand why he took the positions he 
took and why so many black Ameri-

Others came merely to find out

COMMENTARY: Don't mind 
the myths, ethnic and racial 
harmony are a state of mind 

DAMEN 

runron 

We had a somewhat heated 
di~cu i n at my house the olher day 
about racial tereotype reinforcel1lent 
through language during whi h the 
Webster's definition of "bla k" and 
"white" were laken imo consideration. 
While I am one who feel that it is 
unerly si lly to allow language to playa 
huge role in shaping one' moral and 
philosophical beliefs, it is difficult to 
look at bla k denolation . su h as 
"dirty," "thoroughly sini ter or evi L" 
"characterized by ho~tility or angry 
discontent" and "connected with or 

invoking the upem,llural and especially the devil." without 
flinching (or lynching. for you extremi ts). It is likewise 
difficult to accept as denotalions for white "marked by upright 

faimes~." "free from spot or blemish" and "free from moral 
il1lpurity: i/lllocelll ... " 

Needless to say, it was like deja vu when I was sitting in a 
beautiful La Jolla theatre watching Malcolm X (what a paradox. 
right?) and Malcolm ' fellow prisoner Brother Baines intro-
duced these definitions, conuived by "white devils," as 
evidence of severe racial injuslice. 1 don't know about racial 
injustice, but it's all right there in black and white (pardon the 
ex pres ion) for you and 1 to make of it what we will. 

There are fool s of ali race who are completely content with 
the United States of America (and with this world, for that 
matter). ignoring or accepting raci m as a part of life. There are 
disillusioned ideali tS of all ethnic backgrounds who ee and are 
fru trated by frequent acts of prejudice and truly believe that 
they can personally change the world by altering the way people 
think. And there are lost ul of all color ( uch a

A Closer 
Look at the 
Man, the 

Myth and the 
Movie 

COMMENrARY: In a sea 
of hype, we nlust not lose 
sight of Malcolm's message 

GAY E 

IfHf 

I think Spike Lee's successful pre-
Maleollll X publicilY hype had many of 
us feeling like we knew Malcolm X 
personally by the time the movie 
opened on Nov. 18. With so much hype 
around a controversial issue. clashing 
views and agendas for opportunity - in 
thi case the commodification of an 
hi torical figure - are inevitable. This 
has heightened the issue around the 
movie and ilS publicity to new emo-
tional potentials. obscuring possible 
messages of collective empowerment. 

One of the major concems surround-
ing the film was that Spike Lee would make a movie about 
Spike Lee, not Malcolm X. In pan. thi was a spin-off of the 
intense publicity campaign Lee began a year before the movie 
was released. This has proven to be extremely problematic 
because it leaves many of us wondering if Lee was more 
concerned with the money than the urgent need for Malcolm X's 
messages to be clarified for the masses. 

Public Enemy' Chuck D said once thaI show business is 95 
percent business and five percent how. Perhap this explains 
Lee's mas production of X paraphemalia as a fad and not a 
message. The facllhat Lee did this without howing people 
(especially Anglo) the hi tory behind the X lefl us with a lot of 
X hat-wearing white kid aying Ihat Malcolm X was a militant. 
gun-br.rndishing racist. 

But we cannot point the finger solely at Lee - Malcolm X 
said himself lhalthe most important thing that young people can 
do is to think for themselves. I am not surprised at the number of 
people who ate the fad righl up like the nice little consumers

COMMENTARY: Malcolm's 
legacy has been betrayed by 
opportunistic charlatans 

.-) 
BEN 

IIIYIJfUJ{ 

Most people of my generation are not 
old enough to remember fust hand the 
civil rights movement of the '60s and the 
trials and tribulations of its defenders. All 
we have is history, which, more often than 
not, we ignore or distOll into obscene 
caricatures of reality. 

One such caricature. I believe, is 
Malcolm X. My flJ'st encoWlter with 
Malcolm was in grade school when my 
teacher spoke of this man who offered a 
distinctly violent alternative to the non-
violent teachings of Dr. Martin Luther 
King. Jr. The young and impressionable 
youth thar [ was, images of an angry black 

militant throwing bombs through windows flashed through my 
head. then disappeared as the bell soWlding recess brought class to a 
mere iful end. 

I became reacquainted with Mr. X in the summer of 1991 . 
walking down the boardwalk in Venice Beach. The place was lousy 
with "X's" - "X" hats, "X" shirts, door-size "X" posters. But what 
impressed me most was the angry-looking black men wearing shirts 
depicting the famous photo of Malcolm holding his rifle, looking 
out a window, with the caption "By any means necessary." At the 
time, 1 remember thinking to myself, 'This does not bode weU for 
the flIure." And when Los Angeles burned in the spring, r was 
hanlly surprised. 

With "Malcolmania" weeping the nation. 1 felt that it might be 
wise to fmd out for myself who this "X" character reauy was-
rather than relying on the simplistic words of a grade schooltC<k:her 
or the bumpersticker-style slogans emblazoned on a shirt. So I 
bough! a copy of The Autobiography of Malcolm X as told to the 
late Alex Haley, and went to the new f1lm by Spike Lee last week.

JOHNSON: Don't 
believe the hype - make 
up your own mind 
ContInued from pace 4 
we've been brought up to be. The minds of 
many of these people have been beaten into a 
blind ubmi sion by a cepting lhing as they 
are taughl in high school; this means the ab-
sence of subjects on important ethnic historical 
figure . 

Lee 's movie 1'.'111 be the first expo ure to 
Malcolm X for many high school tudenlS, 
aside from popular media portrayals of him as 
a man who thrived on hate. BUI even lhi does 
not help matter much for some, A Nov, 19 
Unio/l-Tribune interview with a high school 
senior made this clear. She said she was "leery 
of seeing Malcolm X elevated to the tatus of 
national hero, con idering he pent almo t hi 
entire public life preaching racial separation 
and black superiority. 'I feel Martin Luther 
King was a (ot more important alld worthy of 
honor. ". 

What this girl does nOl know is that while 
Martin Luther King's message was a powerful 
and progre ive move for change, it was not as 
threatening to white dominance, That's why 
you learn all about Martin Luther King in high 
school. The CIA and other government forces 
(with the Nation of Islam as the uigger finger) 
killed Malcolm X because his me age was 
more threatening. but in the end both he and 
King were murdered for the same reason -
they were bringing together too many types of 
people to rally for change. 

Malcolm X is equally threatening to lhe

of multiculturalism. historical revisionism and 
celebrations of ethnic identity. The Union-

Malcolm X. at leasl for a time) who believe in 
the complete separation of all races and an 
interaction with "your kind" only. 

One of the mostdifficultlhings for a human 
being 10 do is accept a differing opinion as 
valid. However. it cannot be argued that any 
one of the 5.5 billion differing opinion on this 
planet is wrong. 

So what do all of the different definitions. 
inlerpretations and opinions mean to you and] 
right here and right now? I'll tell you whalthey 
mean to a 19-year-old mulatto (that's a flfSt 
generation offspring of an Afro-American and 
a Caucasian for the racially impaired). They 
mean that the world is a really screwed-up 
place .. . not because others possess these dif-
fering v iews and opinions but because others 
continually force me to shape my life in some 
way around these differing views and opin-
ions. The labels, the connotations and the damn 
Webster' Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 
definitions are all etched in stone and it is from 
these givens thal every individual's life must 
for some reason begin. 

But 1 am tired of being an oreo. I am tired of 
being a zebra. 1 am tire<lof being a chocolate 
and vanilla milkshake. a Dianne Carroll 
lovechild and a "hey man. what are you?" 1 am 
tired of society' s absurd but persistent anempt 
to convince me that there are two distinctly 
different aspects of my being when [ know 
damn well that there are at least a trillion. 

Malcolm X was a man of tremendous know 1-
edge and energy but. as much as his life meant 
to society, [grossly disagree with the standard 
human idea of changing the world by changing 
the people who are a part of it. Human energy 
should not be wasted trying to make the world 
a better place for the individual. Human energy 
should be spent trying to make the individual a 
bener person for the world. 

It is only from within that change such as 
racial acceptance grows. Civil rights leader. 
nationalists and even the social commentators 
who write for this very newspaper are. for the 
most pan, doing nothing more than preaching. 
And that incessant preaching is merely strength-

I have a theory for some of this widespread 
Anglo opposition to the movie and to similar 
me ages of empowerment for those group 
other lhan themselves. Cenain movements 
within ethnic groups to promote unity through 
diversity has caused the reverse racism alarm 
to sound around the country.

said she didn't feel it was fair that the ethnic

ening the barriers that individuals have con-
structed as defense against the world's 5.5 
billion differing opinions. As powerful a state-
ment Malcolm X made every time he ex-
pressed his beliefs, it mUSl be remembered that 
this was merely one man's belief. And as 
powerful a statement Spike Lee is attempting 
to make with his ponrayal of this legend. it is 
still merely one man's vision. 

Footage of the Rodney King beating that is 
interwoven with Mafcolm X's opening scenes 
is Lee's way of saying that these issues of racial 
and etlmic prejudice are still an integral pan of 
our society. 

In this same scene. an American flag domi-

of the me sages advanced in Lee 's movie. 
To again quote from one of the high priests 

of conservati m, ourown U/lion-Tribulle, "The 
whites (in this movie) are dead-goners. They're 
'white devils,' even a weet co llege kid who 
asks Mal olm what ~he can do for the black 
strugg le and receives a crushing reply:' oth-
ing ... â¢ 

The words "black" and "power," can be 
threatening to those individuals who previ-
ously felt safe and accepted ignorance. These 
individual may now be feeling as if they are 
behind the times. and although they cannot run 
with the big dogs. they cannOl afford to stay on 
the porch. YetI am surprised at how threatened 
some people feel. because the empire usually 
strikes back. and previous attitudes about people 
of color and power could easily be re tored. 

There is no need to justify Malcoll1l X's 
message for unaware whites and others. Let 
them think on it, providing they do. Otherwise, 
educate them. 

The best thing Ithink we can get out of this 
movie, and the consumerist fads that precede 
and follow it. is a III'W me age for movement. 
Old models used in absolute form do not usu-
ally work in new conlexts. 

Again. Malcolm X himself said that the best 
thing we can do as young people is to leam to 
think for ourselves. Stop insulting yourselves 
by being good little capitalists. buying into the 
fad and not the man, u ing slogans like "By 
Any Means Ncce sary" without reading about 
the message behind it. 

lt may be high time for a revolution, but we 
cannot have one wilh the lack of organizalion 
and leadership existing today, What can we do 
1I0W with Malcolm X's message? Ignore all thi s 
commodification. lhese one-sided views. the 
hypocrisy of the Right, and leI' think for 
ourseh'es about what we can do noll'. 

DOII'( bl'(;C'I '1' (Ire hype. - Public Enemy 

nale.-; the screen in much the same way nn 
American flag dominated the screen during the 
opening scene of PaltOl l, a monument of Ameri-
can film and society. 

Don't get me wrong. Malco(m X is a won-
derful film fi lled with new and pertinent in -
sights that everyone should be exposed to. But 
I cannot get past the fact lhat Ma(co(m X i jusl 
another man preaching to what he sees as a 
miserable and misguided socielY. Only this 
time. it 's more like are-preaching. 

Maybe il takes a person such as myself who 
has been forced into two cullures (or has had 
two cultures forced into him) to see that there is 
no answer to the problem of racism. It i inher-
ent to like those who are the same as you. and 
skin tone can be a most blatant similarily be-
tween two people. Yes, it is superficial. but 
what in Ihis world isn ' t? 

It was not until 1964 and the case of 
McLallghlin v. F(orida that the U.S. Supreme 
Court finally ruled that all laws restricting inter-
racial sex were unconstitutional. In response to 
this. a Republican Party delegate called all 
mixed-marriage couples "murderers of the na-
tion." 

But my parent were not murderers. They 
committed crimes against no political state. 
They cOl1lmitted crimes again t a tragic state of 
mind that contended there was but one way. 
And just as there is not one way to live or one 
way to think. there is no one way to arrive at this 
fictitious haven of racial hannony, 

Raci m is a state of mind. ]t is as much a part 
of every living individual as the skin on his or 
herrespectiveback. Racism. in its infinite forms 
and interpretation. has always been a part of 
human nature and il will always be a pan of 
human nature. There is not a single thing that 
any law, definition or minister of the truth can 
do to change that. 

It is nOI until the individual truly under-
stands him or herself that he or she can even 
begin to understand others. And it is in this deep 
sense of caring for and understanding of others, 
instead of the self. that racial. and human. 
hannony lies. 

Freeing your own mind of the racial shack-
les Ihal have been placed on il by history is a 
necessary step toward inner peace and a true 
sense of human equality. 

Can't you see? There i no racism in the 
world. There is only racism in you,

The media's cafeteria approach to 
the canonization of Malcolm X -
choosing only opinions that are to

American society that Malcolm

it bothers me that he wou ld write u h 
a pompous letter to complain about a

An Open Letter to 
the Rape VIctIm 
Edilor: 

On the morning of ov. 9. a 
woman was beaten and raped at the 
entrance to the UCSD campus. Thi~ 
letter is addressed to her and other 
women who have been attacked or 

are afraid. 
Dear SiSler, 
We don't know your name; we 

don't know what you look like, but 
we feel pain wi th you when we walk 
by the place you were attacked and 
when we walk anywhere alone. 

You are such a trong woman. 
You remind u not juSl to be afraid, 
but that by being trong we can how 
socielY that we do nOi want to be 
afraid anymore. 

We can't know exactly what you 
are feeling, but we do know our own 
anger that women are never safe and 
our own sadness that another woman 
was caught in the violence. 

As we enter campus, we are re-
minded of your fe;ar and pain. But we 
are al 0 reminded that we can never 
be si lent, we mu t always fight for 
justice. We cannot remain s ilently 
afraid. but must corne together to ay 
loudly that violence against women 
must be topped. 

You are in our heans and in our 
thoughts.

Homosexuality Is a 
Sin, Says the Bible 
Editor: 

I am completely outraged that 
Cynthia Forsythe has chosen to mis-
interprelthe Bible in orderto promote 
her own libeml ideas about homo-
exuality ("Year of the Homophobic 
Hetero~exual," ov. 16). 

The Bible, beyond a ~hadow of a 
doubt. regards homosexuality as of-

fensive to God in bolh the Old and 
New Te tament . "It is forbidden for a 
man to have sexual relations with 
another man uch as is nonnal be-
tween a man and a woman. It is utterly 
dete table" (Levitic us I :22). It is 
ab olutely ridiculou to di mi laws 
forbidding homosexuality j ust be-
cause there were other laws in that 
book that counseled again t wearing 
clothe made from two different types 
of thre<ld. Would Forsythe also sug-
gest that we throw out the ten com-
mandments since they are also in the 
Old Te tament? 

She al 0 goe on to Slate that "the 
sameBiblethat supposedlycondemn 
all homosexuals demands that their 
fellow Christians accept them." I 
would adviseCynthiatoread her Bible 
in depth before making in inuations 
that have no Biblical basis. Yes, we as 
Chri tian are in tructed to love and 
accept homosexuals just as we would 
liars. gos ip , thieves or murderers, 
but that does nor mean that we are also 
instructed to accept homosexuality 
and other ins that God clearly de-
nounce .Chri tian are toldto loveall 
men regardles of whichever sin they 
have committed, because we are all 
sinners. and Jesus loves u all uncon-
ditionally. 

No, we are IIOT homophobic, but 
we do till hold to the morals that God 
has shown us to be true and just. We 
do nor hate homose1tuals, but we are 
and will continue to be opposed to the 
ga y and lesbian lifestyles. Instead of 
scoffing at u ,perhaps you. Cynthia, 
need to follow your own advice and 
be open-minded. objectively looking 
at our point of view_

Holme said that he expect tu-

this year, and that even schools with

violated their freedom to walk any-
where they please. 

"When r heard that the rape oc-
curred at 4:30 in the morning, I 
asked myself. why wa he outthere 
at4:30? Butl immediatelycoITCCted 
my elf. A lot of people out there 
don ' t re;alize what it me;ans to say 
that ... it means that women should 
not be walking in the dark, and 
that' aying thatwomendon' thave

liberty to say â¢. I want to walk to the 
library by myself .... one student re-
marked. 

Fifth senior Michelle Milledge 
complained that people hould not 
come together in support of the vic-
tim only when the rJpe has been 
"brutal." She said that the percent-
age of rapes that actually occur in 
the way that the rape on Nov. 9 did 
is miniscule. 

"It's sad that we have to wait for 
a black man to [rape someone] be-
fore we can get angry abou t this ... 
there are tons of UCSO women who 
are date-raped, but we don't hear 
about it, so we don't do anything 
about it. I want to acknowledge that 
rape goes on all the time and that I 
think there is an element of racism 
involved in us organizing around 
this rape," Milledge said. 

Milledgealsocited a UCLA study 
which handed questionnaires tovan-
ous col lege men around the country, 
asking: If you could rape and be 
cel1ain that you could not be caught. 
would you rape a woman? Thiny-
eight percent of men responded yes 
to this que tion. The question was 
then rephrased to ask: If you could 
forcibly have sex with a woman, 
would youdo it? Fifty-eight percent 
of respondents said yes. 

One student concluded that ev-
erybody needs to work to change 
people's attitudes. "A man needs to 
know that when a woman says no, 
he means no." she said.

Caretakers of Malcolm's

ContInued from pa&e 4 

Although I haven't finished the book, 
rvealready formulated a few opinions. 

I like the man - for the most part, at 
least. I admire hi moral courageand his 
unyielding will. He was a true rugged 
individuali t - the Hor:uio Algerof our 
time. What I admire most,( think, is his 
belief that blacks need to take control of 
their lives away from an everÂ·intru ive

Farrakhan, SharJXon and their ilk are 
charlatans - leeches who survive on 
the good devices of their followers. 
Under their guidance, blacks have es-
caped one form of slavery only to be-
come entangled in the chains of another 
- welfare, affrnnative action and the 
projects. It was government "benevo-
lence," after all, which destroyed 
Malcolm' family. institutionalized hi 
mOlher and scanered his brOlhers and 
sisters. Today, welfare is still a problem, 
as i affumative action - an evil 
Malcolm would no doubt ondemn as 
another way for the white man to buy 
out black people's identities. 

Gerald Early, direct r of African 
and Afro-American Studies at Wash-

before justice is served.. but I don't 
believe that blaming the "white racist 
power structure" will solve their pr0b-
lems. Malcolm X had some of the an-
wers. but Pan-Africanism was not one 

of them. Education. literacy, indepen-
dence, morality, self-discipline, spiritu-
ality and brotherhood are the answer. 
Empowerment - that accursed cliche 
- is won. not granted. 

Malcolm necognized that one of the 
greatest ob61acies to justice and equality 
for blacks was anim ity among blacks 
themselve~. Mal a im thought this sort 
ofbehaviorwas absolutely idiolic. Hours 
before he was ~inated, Malcolm

'The story of Malcolm' life is a 
biographical testament to boIh the 
worst and best in human nature and 
will comfort neither his detractors nor 
hi.s idolaters," writes Perry. 

One of the most controversial find-
ings of thi book is its debunking of 
many of Malcolm's claims to racial 
victimization. Perry has not been able 
to find evidence of a confrontation 
Malcolm said hi mOlher Louise had 
with the Ku Klux Klan . Neither can 
he find any evidence that the death of 
his father Earl was caused by white 
racists.

problems originaled from a loveless 
family. Perry presents evidence of 
Malcolm ' occasional homosexual 
behaviorand speculates this may have 
been tied to his conflicting emOlions 
towards his father, whom family 
friends describe as "a naturalÂ·born 
whoremonger" who was brutal to hi 
wife and children. 

Malcolm's all itude towards whites 
wa more complex than we have been 
led to believe. A conflicting color 
consciou ne was deeply rooted in 
hi family. 

Oe pite his Garveyite ambitions, 
Earl favored Malcolm because of his 
fair complexion and green eye. 

Malcolm'smotherLouiseinsisted 
her dad had been a white "prince." 
She tried 10 scrub Malcolm white. 
Malcolm was the only black in his 
class. His first lover was white; the 
women he dated up until rhe time he 
was incarcerated were all white or 
light-skinned blacks. He had many 
white friends and his be t friend in 

ew York prior to his incarceration 
was a Jew named Hymie. 

Part of Malcolm 's laterdenuncia-
tion of wh ites was of course a reaction 
to that era 's overt raci m. But another 
part was over-compensation for hi 
own racial in ecurity. Even after po t-
Mecca Malcolm dropped the white 
deviltheory,he tilldemoniledwhites 
when it suited him. He told a reporter 
in Egypt white had killed four uncle 
and knifed one of his brothers before 
hi very eyes. 

Most of Malcolm's black support-
ers "were anti-white and felt betrayed 
by Malcolm's renunciation of the 
white devil theory," Perry explains. 
'The part of Malcolm that wanted to 
eOler the political mainstream ran 
aground on the incendiary rhetoric 
that enabled him to stay in the lime-
light." 

Malcolm combined stagecraft with 
a messianic self-concept. As a student 
in Michigan, he emertained his peers 
withdance step onthe idewalkwhile 
on break from his dish washing job. 
Later at a nightclub, he danced and 
occasionally played the drums. 

"He seemed to want to be out 
front, on stage, entertaining audi-
ences," writes Perry. In later life, the 
two roles - prophet and entertainer 
- were fused in a way that prefigured 
later "black culture heroes" uch as 
Bob Marley. 

Some Malcolm-ites will be of-
fended by Perry's complex waIt -
and-all portrait. But that Perry neither 
defies nor vilifies Malcolm is of great 
importance at a time when the mas 
marketing of"Maicolm" threatens to 
be eclipsed completely by "fiction 
and myth." 

The realities of his life are more 
profound than fiction . That Malcolm 
came so far only makes the rapid 
transformations of the last year of his 
life all the more astounding. 

I love Malcolm, but I feel that our 
late-blooming obsession wilh him is a 
disturbing reflection of our inability 
to create a language to describe con-
temporary race relations. Some Afri-
can-Americans are upset that Malcolm 
is being "white-washed." 

Yet, as UC Berk.eley sociologist 
Hany Edwards points out, if Malcolm 
were alive today he would not be 
talking in the same language he was 
using in the early 1960s. 8y the end of 
his life, he had, in fact, rejected black 
nationalism as a philosophy. He was 
looking ahead. 

1 hope that in time we will take 
Malcolm off his pedestal, quit chain-
ing him to his words from a distant 
past and envision what Malcolm's 
spirit will say when he speaks in the 
voices of the prophets of a new gen-
eration.

By Bree Segal 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's and women's 
swinlming and diving ttams held their 
1992 home opener yesterday, tacldinga 
tough Division D Cal Stale Northridge 
team at Canyonview Pool. 

Among the highlights were first 
places taken by Mike Mc eff in the 
200-yard freestyle, Tom Perkin in the 
200-yard breast:strokeandBrian Baskin 
in the 200-yard backsuoke. 

anoIher day. The Fakons were dead. 
Vance's goal left Harper breathless. 

"It was an amazing goal, right out of!he 
movie Hoosiers. TheshOl seemed like it 
was in low mOlion. Amazing, imply 
amazing," Harper said. 

"Everybody feels incredibly fortu-
nate that we won." Harper said "We 
were overconfident and we didn't play 
well at all. learly the bener tCiun won, 
but we were lucky to win like that. 
When it comes down to udden death. 
anything can happen." Harper added. 

H:uper praised goalkeeper Warren 
for a "magnificent" performance. 

The Tritons. seeded sixth in the 
CM toumament, will face third USC 

in Friday's opening round. The Trojans 
are favored to beat UCSD. "We should 
play much better than we did today 
against Air Force. We almost always 
play better when the OIher telml is eK-
peeted to win." Harper said. 

UCSD will be making its second 
consecutive and third over.tll appear-
ance in the NCAA O1:unpion hips. TIle 
Tritons finished sixth in the nation in 
both previous appearances. in 19 9 and 
1991. 

Adam B urgasser took first for the 
Tritons in both the one- and three-meter 
diving events.

The Triton women succeeded with 
wins by Sabrina Lum in the 100- and 
200-yard btmerfly; Jocelyn Rothbard in 
the I yard freesryle; and Dustin Mat-
thew in the ZOO-yard breaststroke. JiU 
Jackson took first in the one-and threc-
meter diving competition. 

UCSD is training harder lhlIn ever 
with II intensive wodcours a week. 
"We haven't had a day off this week. 
Twenty-five hOllrs a week - swim-
ming takes upa lot of time, but it's worth 
it," sophomore Tom Perkin said. 

Perkin explained that the Jan. 30 
meet against Kenyon College should be 
a good indicator of how the national 
meet will tum out. 

"With the quality of the recruits and 
theimprovedanitudeoftheteam, we're 
going to give Kenyon a run for !heir 
money," swimmer Brian Baskin said. 

The Kenyon dual meet will enable 
the Tritons to face tough competition in 
preparation for March' ationals in 
Atlanta. 

Both in tile water and out. there is a 
real sense of team spirit. Carie Parker. a 
new freshmen recruit, said. '" was kind 
of nervous corning here; I've never 
trained like this before but theteanl is so

The Triton WOOlen face Punallou

Tritons Outlast T:.gers in 
Season Opener, 88-74 

By Grea Wrenn 
Sports Editor 

With all of the 
changes prom i<;ed 
for thi s sea on's 
men ' ba ketball 
team, Friday' sea-
<;on opener had at 
least one thing in 
common wi th last 
year'~ team: the result. The Tritons hit 
the ground running thi season as they 
outl~ted a \lubbom Occidental leam 
and captured the flN game of the '92-
'93 -.eason, -74. 

It wasn't easy ~ r U D. though. 
TheTritonsdidn ' tgetonthe oreboard 
until Andy Swindall took a pass from 
Rodney Lusain and fed teammate Brnd 
Halte on the left ide. Halte iced the five 
fOOler. and the Tritons had their first 
buck.:t a full two minutes into the con-
I !.I, 

Marshall insened his run-and-gun 
"luad, the "Freeway Five," only five 
minutes into the game with the Triton 
up 6-5. The highwaymen immediately 
C;lU~ trouble for the Tigers with a full 
coun press that slowed the Occidental 
game to a crawl. 

With the team oonling back and 
fonn at 11 -8, Kahlil Allen and Lusain 
teamed up for the play of the young 
season. Point guard Lusain had his team 
running and found freshman Allen 
breaking down the right sideline. Lusain 
di:.hed it off and Allen went in for the 
kill from the right side. Occidental's 
Tor M hren could only watch the bot-
10m of Allen' hoo, as Allen took off 
from oUl~ide the key and went up-and-
over. He didn 't land until after he had 
slammed down a monster two-handed 
jam that gave UCSD the five-point 
lead. 

CSD matched up well with 
Occidental' ize. but the Tritons had a 
linle trouble pulling down the boards, 
~pecially the offen~ive ones. at the 
beginning of the game. Mar:.hall called 
a lime out midway through the fU'l>t half 
and made !>Ome adjustments to the 
UCSD rebounding scheme. "We knew

edge including 17 from Swindall and II 
from Halte. 

The half ended with the Tritons in 
control 40-30. The second half started 
out as lowly as the fust one did for 
UCSD, lcuing the Tigers creep back 
into the gallle. 

Occidental closed to within three 
points ix minules into the second half, 
after UCSD had managed only three 
buckets ince intermission. TIlCTigers' 
Hung Duong drove the lane and got a 
slep past the free throw line when he 
was met by two Tritons. Duong threw 
up an underhanded prayer that spun 
around the rim and fell in, bringing 

Occidental to within 4643. 
But that was as close as they would 

come. UCSD woke up and went on an 
184 run that was capped off when 
Kareem Matthews grabbed the loose 
ball under the Occidental hoop and put 
in an easy two-footer to give the Tritons 
the 6447 edge with 8:03 to play. 

UCSD seemed to be on cruise con-
trol for the rest of the game, letting 
Occidental close to within 77-70 wilh

in any serious trouble as the Tigers were 
forced to stan fouling eve!)' few sec-
onds. Moore led the team with24points, 
16 of those in the rust half. Halte scored 
14 while Swindall chipped in 12 for 
UCSD. 

For Marshall, it was a satisfying 
opener. "We playa variety of offensive 
sets, and we were mediocre in all of 
them. But that takes practice and we'll 
get it down soon. Our depth is a strength 
of our team and we saw that tonight 
because we got good play outofa lot of 
people," the coach said 

"We were up and down a linle bit," 
Moore said "But overall I'm real pleased 
with the way things went." 

UCSD Splits Redlands Tournament 
WOMEN'S BASKETBALL: Tritons win first game but fall in championship contest 
By Art Root 
Associate spons Editor 

Amled with an ag-
gre ~ive, up-tempo 
style. the UCSD 
women ' basketball 
team opened the 
1992-93 regular sea-
son by splirring two 

games at the Redlands Tournament 
The Tritons defeated Colorado College 
on Friday before falling to ebraska 
Wesleyan in thetoumamentchampion-
hip game on SalUrday. 

In the first round, the young Tritons 
survived a plethora of fust-half errors to 
run past Col rado College, 85-60. The 
Tritons, facing an aggressive. fuU-coun 
defense, sputtered in the opening min-
utes of the contest. "We Slat1ed out 
really lowly in the fll'St half." UCSD 
Head Coach Judy Malone said. "We 
had the first-game jitters. and we made 
everyball-handlingenoryoucanmake," 
she said. 

UCSD settled down in the second 
half. The Tritons' offense kicked into 
gear, repeatedly beating the press for 
easy baskets and cruising to an 85-60 
viaOf)'. Malone was encowaged by her 
team' poise. "After our shaky stan, we 
really came on in the second half and 
played much better," Malone said. 

UCSD center Erica Scholl, a 6-1 
senior, scored 13pointsandrippeddown 
23 rebounds in the opener. The Tritons 
didn't fare as well in the championship, 
falling to Nebraska Wesleyan, 79-67. 

While UCSD shot well from the 
noar and the free-throw line, the club 
had trouble with Nebraska Wesleyan's 
trapping defense. ThesenD-<Iominarcd

the flJ'St half alone. 'We shoI better than 
they did. but thetumovers killed us- We

ran out of gas," Malone said. 

The inexperienced Tritons. witbonly 
four seni<n on the roster, were beaIen at 

their own up-tempo, full<oun game. 
'Theypressed and trapped the ball hard 
I think we have a quick team, but they

Tritons Win Duel in the Pool 
WAtER POLO: UCSD wins WWPA tournament with no time remairllng in udden death 
overtime as Vanre's shot sends the Tritons to next weekend's NCAA towney 
By Art Root 
Associate Sports Editor 

Somebody had to lose, and this time 
it was the Falcons. The 1992 WWPA 
title game was a thriller forthe ages, one 
ofthemost exciting and dramatic games 
in Triton history. With one shot, the 
UCSD men's water polo team won the 
1992 Western Water Polo Association 
Championship, defeating Air Force in 
sudden death overtime, 9-8. By win-
ning the WWPA title, the Tritons auto-
matically receive a berth in next 
weekend's NCAA Otampionships in 
Long Beach. 

Sophomore two-meter man Mike

The Tritons (22-7) made it to the 

WWPA fmal with blowout victories 
over Redlands and Oaremont-Mudd-

Clara and UC Davis. setting up the 
match against UCSD. 

UCSD sailed through the first round 
with a 19-2 demolition of RedIand.~ on 
Friday. After a quiet first period, the 
Triton offense exploded, scoring 17 
goals over the next three quaners.

Amazingly, 12 different Tritons

The overconfident Tritons couldn't 
shake the Falcons. Air Force netted 
three shots in the second period, while 
holding the Tritons to only one score. 
The halftime score: UCSD 3, AFA 3. 

The Falcons continued the barrage.

quarter. Suddenly. the season was slip-
ping away from the Triton , as only 
seven minutes stood between UCSD 
and an early Thanksgiving vacation. 
"We gQ( in some trouble, and the guys 
stalted to pick up the intensity, but it was 
almost too late," HaipCr said. 

UCSD regained its composure and

1992 
victory die in tile water. Air Force' ~ 
goalk.eeper, junior Doug Sheesley, had 
been ejected. With a position player in 
goal, Harper estimated that a good shot 
would have a 99 percent chance of 
going in. Yet two-meter-man Kevin 
Vance, till nursing an injured hand, 
flubbed the shot. "We shoo ld have won 
it right there, but Kevin never got a 
handle on the ball," Harper said, 

The see-saw battle saw each tearn 
score one goal in the fll'St overtime. So 
the banle-wearied Tritons and Falcons 
went back to the pool for another over-
time period. And another. Neither team 
scored in the second or third overtime, 
meaning the game would be decided in 
a three-minute sudden-<leath overtime 
period. 

With :00 remaining in the first sud-
den-death overtime period, Vance 
atoned for his founh-<juaner gaffe and 
ended the two-hOW' slugfest. Warren 
fired a pass to the streaking Vance, all 
alone behind the Air Force defense. 
Wanen's pass was a bit too strong, 
overshooting Vance and dying eight 
meters in front of the Air Force goal . 

It seemed as if the Falcons would be 
able to fall back into pos.ition before 
Vance could get a good shot. On such a 
play, the Air Force goalie houk! have 
stayed in position and waited for his 
defense to recover. Inexplicably, Fal-
con goalie Sheesley went out for the 
ball. Vance beat Sheesley to the ball and 
ftred a shot Sheesley blocked the shot 
right back to Vance. Vance, now sur-
rounded by Sheesley ana another Fal-
con defender. elevated and lobbed a 
shot. The buzzer sounded as the ball 
noated in a gentle arc over the out-
stretched defenders and into the goal.

in three sets 
ContInued from pace 1.6 
and "would easily be a top-10 team in 
Division Il," according to Dannevik. 
The last team to beat Washington at 
horne was UCSD when it captured the 
1990 championship. 

But an upset was not to be. The 
Tritons had already faced the Bears 
twice thi year and hadn 't won a game 
during the regular season. Despite the 
odds, UCSO tayed with Washington 
!he whole way. 

With the score tied at ix, the two 
teams battled the next point for II rotaÂ· 
tions. The Bears then jumped out to a 
12-6 lead, but the Tritons oonled back 
and closed to within 12Â·10.

The second and third games were a 
war of attrition for UCSO. The Tritons 
hung tough but juSl couldn't stay with 
Washington. 

"We gave them a good tight and got 
them worried," said Kranz. who had 
even kills. "We weren't as overÂ· 

whelmed as people expected us to be." 
"We were the underdogs. so there 

wasn't any pressure on us. We could 
just go out and play." sophomore Julie 
J-laJvey said. 

"They just wore us out. Washington 
was just flat out the better team," 
Dannevik said. " [t was like 'Rocky;' we 
just kept hanging in there." 

Kristi Askeland was the only Triton 
named to the aUÂ·tournament team. 

But for the Tritons to even gel to the 
final match was a victory. After winning

But a few of the students at UCSD haven't followed thi pattern at all.

Literarure. After graduaJing this spring. she will 
continue working toward her ultimale goal of 
gaining certifICation to teach high school English. 

Dang Nguyen,69,a reruming student, says that 
he really enjoy interacting with other students on 
campus. Originally from Vietnam, he has been in 
the United States for five years now. He has nine 

chiIdrcn, all of whom have already received some 
sort of university educalion, Now that his children 
are grown and all have jobs, he has time to go back 
to school. 

Having spent most of his life in the war-torn 
counlry. Nguyen had little opponunity to seek an 
education and suppoI1 his family at the same time. 
'1 have seen so much damage and so many wounds 
from war, so I'd like to do sorncdling in life, 
something useful. I can't do anyth ing with physical 
strength because of my age. but I can do something 
with knowledge," 

Although he was the Iasr in his family to pursue 
a univer.;ity education, his age did not discourage 
him from corning Ix1ck. 

"People will always have someIhing 10 Iearn," 
says Nguyen. "Thar's why I'm here. Borh the body 
and brain need exercise. Besides, it's a pleasure to 
come into contact with young people." 

Most importantly, Nguyen feels lhal going to 
college will help him to integrate into society and 
understand the American cullUre. 

Nguyen, a French Literature major. says thai 
when he was YOWlS, il was exciting to be studying 
towards a degree. Now, he enjoys just studying for 
himself. Although he claims to study much better 
as a result of his life experiences, his advanced age 
still causes him a few difficulties. 

"The memory is not so good, and the sight is not 
so good. Sometimes. (cannot see what is wrinen on 
the blackboard. I think that I must be the oldest 
student at UCSO," he says. 

Often, reruming to college after only a few 
years of work. experience can make a world of 
difference. Daniel Soper, a returning undergradu. 
are SIUdent at age 25, began srudying at the univerÂ· 
sity level in 1985 and is currently wOlking towards 
an EBE (ecology) degree.

I usually don't because fm usually on

the safest places to bike are the well,lit 
areas that are forbidden for riding. 
Deena Mnllareddy, Muir Senior 

I walk around 
by myself at

fast and look 
around. I also 
often call campus

Lisa Houle, Muir Sophomore 

Whenl'm 
walking around 
campu late at 
night, I try to 
walk really 
"strong." It's sad 
because I donlt 
want to feel I have to walk around defen, 
sively. A friend of mine walked to his car 
at 3:15 a,m. without even thinking about 
it. I couldn't even consider that.

Muir sophomorc Frith J.1 ob 
believes thllt a comfortable 
weight makes her feel bellcr 
about he~lf. "I ~niveto , hieve 
what I :.ee as the ideal body. J also 
w1mt to feel healthy," she says. 

Similarly,lllirdfiN-year!>tu-
dent Julie Posthumus feeb un-
comfortable when he feeb un-
healthy or overweight. She says 
that when he feels thin. ~hc has 
more self<ontidence :U1d more

Desire to control weight i widespread on campll\ says Kaylecn 

Usenik-Reilly, a health and nutrition speciali t ai UC D. She 
e!>timate.<. that 30 percent of her patients cite weight management as 
acoocem, regardlCSl. of" hethcror 1101 they are c linica/lyoverweighL 

OIher Sfudents, however, havediffercnt reasons For keeping their 
weight down. For example. TrJCY Jorgeru.on, a Revelle nior, 
maintUns Ihat she is weight< nM:ious for financial reasons. " I don't 
want to have to buy bigger clothes. becau.'oC I don't have a lot of 
money. Money i prime, and it is much cheaper to eat less and not 
have to buy clothes." :.he says. 

"I [wat h my weight] because 
my whole family is overweight." 
explains Third junior Amil Shami . . 

Studcnrs also cite social reasons 
forwatchingtheirweight. "Most of 
the girls I know are weight-con-
scious," Posthwnus says. "but the 
guysdon'lseem to worry about it as 
much as the girls do." 

aronO'Owyer, a Revellejun-
ior, agrees. "Most women at this 
age are weight-conscious because 
of what men tell them. II is socially 
acceptabletobethin,l1OIfat.ldon'l 
have 10 worry [alx>ut my weight). 
My genetic disposition is such that 
I can eat a lot and not gain weight," 
he says. 

Chris Medvil2, a Warren jun-
ior, also say he is not consciou of 
hL~weighl. "J look at [myself] inthe 
mirror, but J don 'I consciou Iyeat 
around [my weight] and spend a lot 
of time on the scale, because Idon't 
have a problem." 

He points out that while many 
of his friends work out, it's morc to 
tay healthy and maintain muscle 

rather than to control their weight. 
Many men insist that they are 

just as conscious of their weight as 
women. perhaps even more so, but 
not because they want to trim off a 
few inches, A lot of male srudents 
feel they need to bulle up. " I want to 
gain weight because people are al-
ways telling me I'm too skinny," 
confides Third fust-year student 
Man Donham. "I eat [a lot], but 1 
can't gain weighl" 

He lifts weights on a regular 
ba..~is andealli an enot1l1OUlIwnount

You have one night. 

It seems unfair. The genius had all that time. While you have a few

In order to get bigger. Muir 
sophomore D:lI1ny Hsu eats and 
exercises, he say ,While he tries to 
avoid junk food. he loads up on 
foods full of protein and carbohy-
drates, whi h expe~ describe as 
essential for gaining muscle and 
for maintaining the energy needed 
for uccessful workout -. 

Even the reasons for oming 
overweighl vary, as Usenik Reilly 
noted. "People who often em se-
cially may become overweight be-
cause food accompanies all that 
they do. Sorneothers put on weight 
because of overeating to cope with 
SIre . In other cases. people just 
don't know what to eat, so they 
choose foods which are high in 
fat" she explains. 

"When I sense troubleor uncer-
tainty in my life, I tend to eat a lot, 
whereas others may choosetodrink 
or do drugs," says Sh:unis. 

According to Usenik-Reilly, 
there are also risk factors involved 
in being overweigh!. "S me health 
risks are developing diabetes. a 
risk -increase of cardiovascu lar dis-
ease, which may also elevate the 
cholesterol level. and higher blood 
pfCS!>urc. In addilion, people who 
are overweight have less athletic

The types of people who are 
conscious of lheir weight vary. 
Larosasays. "Ages vary from group 
to group. Sometimes 1 see youths 
and people in their early twenties. 
I've even encountered people in 
their early eighties," she says. 

In order to control their weight, 
many students change their eating 
habits and follow e~erclse pr0-
grams, says Shelby Downing of 
Fwnily Fitness Center. She adds 
that peerpressureconvinces people

don't have one thing that I do a lot. J just do Iiule things," ~he says. 

"I'm IIOlmuch of an exercising person. so I try 10 watch what 1 eat

Do\\l11ing recommends that those who are conscious of their

AGE: Returning 
students feel that their 
maturity aids in study 
Continued from pa&e S2 

Soper says thai before he decided to 
leave college, he had been laking ran-
dom classes and was unsure what he 
wanted to pursue. He didn 'I know wh:u 
It was that he wanted from college. 

ow, after time in the worting world, 
Soper has returned to try and real ize hi 
goals. "That' what college is for - to 
helpreach those thing you dream aboul 
I'm here because I want to be." 

Like Marlowe, Soper agrees thai his 
life experiences have prepared him for 
a new approach 10 studying. "The ben-
efil forme is that my attirude haschanged. 
This is something I wanl rather than 
somelhing I have to do. When il comes 
down 10 it, that' whal college is for -
10 reach your dreams aryd figure out 
what you want 10 do." 

Financial conditions are no less com-
plicat.ed for returning students. In addi-
tion to taking 12 units this quaner, Soper 
must work 50 hours a week to support 
himself." 0 social life helps," he says. 

John Widell, aJsoan EBE major and 
returning student, say ,"11' s n ice to be in 
an~licenvi.ronmentagain."WideU 
spent the last five years ding various 
jo~. includingdrivingarruckand work-
ing at a fish farm. He also served two 
years in the army. His recent move to 
Southern California was hi twenty-
fiflhrel arion injust five years, he says. 

"If we'd come straight out of high 
school andjU5l gone ahead (tocollegel, 
ldon't thinkeitheroneofuswouldhave 
known where he wanted to be," says 
Widell of himself and Soper. He be-
lieves that he has benefited from having 
an advanced perspective of life. 

Where the physical and intel1ectual 
differences that stem from age are con-
cemed, Widell says that he feels he has 
more in commoo withtheT As here than 
with the other students. 

Soper holds a imilar view. "You 
don't make quite as many friends be-
cause others don't identify as well. 
People seem intimidated sometimes," 
he says. 

Marlowe wants to be treated just like 
any otherstudenl Shedoesn 't wantto be 
set apan. "I enjoy being with other stu-
dents, but there's till acertain distance," 
he remarks. 

When Marlowe fIrst attended UCSD 
two decades ago during the Vietnam 
Warera,:.he went through much of the 
soul-searching that afflicts yOWlg col-
lege students. "'There were a lot more 
important things on my mind then," she 
says. ow, she can concentrale more 
directly on her srudies. "Nothing intimi-
dates me," she adds. 

Soper agrees. "It's great being back. 
This is one of the best tim I've had in 
my lifc-II 's incredible to acquire knowl-
edge and feel like I'm working towards 
a goal. Plus, it's nice to have intellectua1 
people to talk to." He also claims that 
whereas he used to 

younger than most ofhisclassmates, he 
doesn't feel that he's missed out on 
anylhing. 

As a frrst -year studen~ he was a little 
self-conscious and ~rvous because he 
wasn't sure how people would react to 
his age. but it dido't tum out to be a 
problem for him. "In high school, ev-
eryone !mew the difference between a 
freshman and a senior. But it doesn't 
really matter in college because there is 
such a diversity of students here," he 
says. If his education had run it's stan-
dard course, Walker would still be a 
senior in high school now. 

Rebecca Pin was also 16 when she 
enteredcollege."I' ve been around older 
people ince kindelganen, so it's not 
that different being at college." She 
agrees that age is no! a big deal. "It's 
harder because I just got my driver's 
license and last year I couldo 't go to TJ

don't even have the option." Like 
Walker, she agrees !hat it played a much 
bigger role in high school than atUCSD. 

Payne feels no self-consciousness 
about her age here. "People are, like, 
'Gosh, you must really be smart,' and I 
kind of like that," she says. "People tell 
me I look young a Iat. lt usually doesn't 
bother me Wlless it's a guy, and r like 
him or something_ I don't want him 10

thall that, I feel that I've benefited from 
having an extra year. It's coollhat I got 
to staJt one year earlier than everyone 
else." 

Thegeneralconsensusbetweenthese 
younger students at UCSD seems to be 
that the only time they have found that 
age causes a real problem is when it

While age can 
seem to be an influ-

Not being able to go to Tijuana was 
also a problem for Nicole Payne, an-
