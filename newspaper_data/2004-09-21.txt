An Augu t court order has 
blocked about $15 million of fall 
fee hikes for some students at UC 
professional schoal as part of a 
clas -action lawsuit against the uni-
versity system. 

Arguing that the tuition increas-
es passed by the UC Board of 
Regents to offset state funding cuts 
violate a contract, the students 
"have demonstrated a substantial 
likelihood of success on the merits 
of their complaint," San Francisco 
Superior Court Judge .James L. 
Warren stated in a preliminary 
injunction. 

Calling the decision "unprece-
dented ," UC spokesman Hanan 
Eisenman said the university 
remained confident it would even-
tually prevail in the suit. Lawyers 
for the system have already filed an 
appeal to overturn the ruling. 

In the meantime, the university 
will send out adjusted billing state-
ments to affected students and issue 
refunds to those who already made 
payments, he said. 

"We understand student con-
cerns about the fee increases, but

Budget deal funds extra freshmen 
State support for UC slashed nearly $200 million

tougher student eligibility 
Board will consider raising minimum

By VLADIMIR KOGAN 

News Editor 

More than 1,500 students orig-
inally told to wait until junior year 

to attend a UC campus have 
accepted a belated offer of fresh-
man admission, according to uni-
versity officials. However, the 
extra $12 rrullion to enroll the eli-

gible students who were previous-
ly denied entrance was one of few 
pleasant surprises for the universi-
ty in a budget agreement between 
the state legislature and Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger. 

Under the approved budget, 
the University of California will 
lose more than 6 percent of its 
state funding, or nearly $200 mil-
lion, bringing the number of con-
secutive years of state cuts to four. 
The money will be made up 
through program cuts and higher 
student fees adopted in May of 
2004, according to UC spokesman 
Hanan Eisenman. 

"This is a very good day for 
students, the University of 
California and the state," 
Eisenman said, explaining that the 
deal and a separate agreement 
signed between UC President 
Robert C. Dynes and the gover-
nor will allow the university to 
"stop the bleeding."

Faced with opposition from 
advocacy groups and allegations of 
misleading statistical models, the 
UC Board of Regents has twice 
postponed voting on a controversial 
proposal to raise the grades students 

need to apply to the university. 
However, the board approved 

several other "procedural adjust-
ments," which will take effect imme-
diately but have little practical 
impact on students applying to the

Regent resigns amid 

attendance controversy 
UC Regent Haim Saban announced his res-

ignation from the university's governing body 
after a newspaper published his record of 
attendance at board meetings. 

A July analysis of university records by the 
San Die90 Union-Tribune concluded that 
Saban missed more than two·thirds of meet-
ings since his appointment by former Gov. 
Gray Davis in 2002. During the 2002-03 aca-
demic year. he missed all of the board meet· 
ings and attended fewer than one of every five 
of his committee meetings, the paper found. 

Citing the report. state Sen. Jeff Denham 
(R'Merced) called for Saban's resignation. 

In his letter to the rest of the board, Saban 
cited only "personal reasons" and did not make 
mention of the criticism directed toward him. 

The media mogul. whose Saban 
Entertainment and Fox Family Worldwide creat-
ed the. "Mi6hty Morphin Power Rangers· fran-
chise, contnbuted a total of $150,000 to Davis' 
re-election campaign as late as a month before 
his appointment according to records main-
tained by the secretary of state. 

Nominated by the govemor and approved 
by the state Senate, Regents serve 12-year 
nonpaid terms and cannot be removed for 
poor attendance_ A successor to serve out the 
remainder of Saban's term will be named by 
Gov. Amold Schwarzenegger.

Bill limits financial aid restridions 
Lawmaker says drug conviction provision wrong 

8, MARGaET GONZALES 
Staff Writer 

As lawmakerS finalize an omnibus 
collection of higher education pro-
posals in Congress, they will decide 
whether to restore federal financial 
aid to students who were disqualified 
for past drug convictions under a 
1998 law. 

While the opposition to the 
original provision is not new, stu-
dent advocates have recently found 
an unlikely ally: Rep. Mark Souder 
(R-Ind.). who authored the law. 

Under current guidelines, the 
U.S. Department of Education 
automatically denies aid to students 
who admit to having criminal drug 
records on the Free Application for 
Federal Student Aid. Students who 
fail to answer the questions regard-
ing records are also denied aid_ 

"'The language of the [Higher 
Education Act] does not distinguish 
between convictions that occur 
before and after the student applies 
for. or receives, federal financial assis-
rance," said Jane GIicIanan, a depart-
ment spokeswoman. 

Since it went into effect, more 
than 150,000 students became inel-
igible for aid because of the law, 
according to Scott Elhers, the out-
reach director for the Coalition for 
Higher Education Act Reform, a 
group opposed to the provision. 

Although debate over interpre-
tation has ensued since the law's 
approval, Souder has joined the 
calls for reform. Unlike CHEAR 
and other groups that would like to 
eliminate the restriction, Souder 
said it is being applied incorrectly 
and was never meant to punish stu-
dents for past wrongs. 

"When [Souder] wrote the bill in 
1998, the intention was that students 

who receive taxpayers' dollars have a 
responsibility to obey the law, and 
students who are using drugs while 
they're at school are not demonstrat-
ing that they value their educatioo," 
said Martin Green, press secretary 
for Souder. "However, [Souder] and 
the Coogress were upset at the out-
rageous fashion the Clinton admin-
istration had interpreted the amend-
ment. We've been worlcing since 
1998 to get it corrected." 

Department officials also contin-
ued to interpret the aid restrictions 
to deny aid for past convictions 

" The drug provision has a 
greater i111J>act on J>9or 

aitd middle class stUdents 
and racial minorities ... " 
- Scott Elhers, OlEAR cIredor 

under the Bush administration. 
A provision included in the cur-

rent proposal for the HEA reautho-
rization spells out that students will 
only lose financial aid if they are 
convicted of a drug offense while 
enrolled at school, Green said. 
Congress is expected to vote on the 
final bin later in the fall or in early 
200S. 

"The Department of Education 
under the Clinton administration 
was responsible for writing the reg-
ulations that enforce the law, but 
they had misinterpreted . what 
Congress had intended," Green 
said. "The amendment referred to 
students who were already enrolled 
and receiving aid, not applicants. 
So a drug conviction four years ago 

is not supposed to affect the eligi-
bility for a student newly applying 
for financial aid." 

The new bill will also emphasize 
that the ineligibility period is tem-
porary. Students who complete a 
drug rehabilitation program and 
successfully pass two unannounced 
drug tests will again be able to 
receive funding, he said. 

CHEAR is opposed to the new 
bill, arguing that the changes will 
not fully address the innate flaws of 
the policy. 

"We feel that the [current pro-
posal] does not go far enough, and 
still means that a lot of students will 
be left out of receiving financial aid 
and forced to drop out of school," 
Elhers said_ "The drug provision has 
a greater impact 00 poor and middle 
class students and racial minorities, 
who tend to have higher rates of 
drug convictions for a variety of fac-
tors_ That is why full repeal of the 
drug provision is needed_" 

CHEAR has backed a bill by 
Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), which 
seeks to repeal the HEA drug provi-
sion completely. The bill has been 
introduced three times in past years, 
but failed to pass. Frank's current 
bill, however, has gained 64 congres-
sional co-sponsors and has launched 
a student-led nationwide campaign 
against the drug law by a group 
called Raise Your Voice. 

The Drug Rdixm Coordination 
Network and the Students for 
Sensible Drug Policy have also 
endorsed the campaign. 

"We welcome the possibility for 
more students to be able to attend 
college with the financial assistance 
that they need," Elhers said.

What is Fox's biggest challenge? 
Fox should 'show 

students ~he money' 
By BRYAN TSAO 

Opinion Editor 

In the immortal words of Cuba 
Gooding Jr.: "Show me the 
money'" That's what UCSO's new 
chancellor, Marye Anne Fox, must 
do first and foremost. Whether 
she does it by building hotels on 
campus land, boosting alumni giv-
ing or holding bake sales on her 
front lawn, she must accomplish 
this task. As California's popula-
tion grows, the University of 
California must serve more and 
more people at a

crisis is also forcing a reduction in 
financial aid, potentially pricing 
student.. our ofUCSD and further 
homogenizing the student body. 
Because of the decrease in state 
fund. , our classes will be larger, 
our teac~ers and staff compensat-
ed more poorly, fewer students 
will be able to mend UCSD, and 
less money will be spent on 
research. 

Add it all up and the message is 
clear and ominous: Without more 
funding, UCSO's ability to pro-
vide a quality education at an 

affordable price is 
time when its bud-
get is getting 
smaller and small-
er. While the UC 
Board of Regents 
and our past chan-
cello rs have done 
an ad mirable job 
trying to maintain 
the quality of edu-
cation with drasti-
ca ll y decreasing 
state support, the 
sad truth of the 
matter is that the

Without strong leadership in 
finding new revenue streams to 
replace lost state fund ing, all 
UCSD students - present and 
future - will suffer. 

According to UC officials, the 
university currently operates on 
$3 billion in state funding at a 
time when it was expected to 
operate on $4 billion, and stu-
dents are footing a large part of 
the bill - as everyone noticed 
when it came time to send in 
tuition checks. California's budget 

generous endowments and gener-
ous grant packages, that strain is 
making UCSD less competitive in 
attracting top students as well. To 
maintain UCSO's status as an elite 
research university, Fox must stem 
the tide of rising fees and falling 
aid. 

In order to do so, Fox must go 
beyond her predecessor's initia-
tives and seek out untapped rev-
enue streams. While UCSD

Fox should focus on student life 
By DANIEL 1UITS 

Senior Staff Writer 

"With great power comes great 
responsibility" - Spider-Man's 
motto, but new Chancellor Marye 
Anne Fox would do well to heed 
the words of the webslinger. 

Fonner Chancellors Robert C. 
Dynes and Manha A. Chandler 
typically employed a hands-off 
approach when it came to student 
life, leaving much of the day-to-
day interaction with students to 
subordinates. These lesser admin-
istrators, from college deans to the 
University Centers Director Gary 
Ratcliffe to Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Joseph W Watson, 
act within their respective spheres 
of influence to establish policy 
regarding student life. The chan-
cellor him- or herself rarely got his 
or her hands dirty. Even when stu-
dents artracted state- or nation-
wide controversy, like with the 
Nicholas Berg video controversy, 
Chandler stayed out of it. 

Fox needs to make an effort to 
do better; she should take sides, get 
into the thick of things and let the 
students know that she's more than 
the lady who fills their inboxes with 
"Chancellor's Notices." 
Specifically, Fox should take a more 
active role in shaping student life. 

WatsOn cancels beer gardens? 

Fox can let them flow. Ratcliffe uses 
a technicality in the rulebook to halt 
a controversial student program on 
Library Walk? Fox can SWld up to 
him on behalf of students' rights. 

If Fox sets up her adminstra-
tion correctly, interventions 
should be unnecessary. By laying 
down the law ahead of time and 
telling the adminstrative under-
lings that there's a new Fox in the

'Chancellor's Notices.'" 

henhouse - Watson and the oth-
ers hould follow her lead. But it~ 
up to her to lead. 

One of Dynes' great talents 
was pulling in money for the 
school, despite pathetic alumni 
support. However, under his 
administration, student life was 
left wanting, as donors rarely ear-

mark a contribution for UCSD's 
student government, which pro-
vides valuable student services 
such as dances, concerts like Sun 
God and A.S. SafeRide (formerly 
known as Triton Taxi). 

The A.S. programming office 
sends its minions to find willing 
sponsors to help with funding, but 
they face an artificially erected bar-
rier: alcohol companies are forbid-
den as funding sources. Although a 
single Budweiser banner at FallFest 
could net thousands of dollars, the 
administration insists on treating 
students like children, shielding 
our eyes from the sinister allure .of 
alcohol, despite the ubiquity of 
alcohol ads in cvcI}'day life. 

Lifting the childish restrictions 
on advertising revenue sources will 
free up A.S. funds for other ven-
tures, like new student-run busi· 
nesses, activities or money for clubs. 

At her former university, Fox 
was known as a powerful leader-
some of her staff there actually 
resigned rather than follow her 
vision for the school. Applied here, 
this lcind of strength could do won-
ders to improve the blandness of 
student life. Having a vibrant com-
munity at UCSD would make our 
school a more attractive destina-
tion for students, and could poten-
tially have a beneficial effect on 
alumni donations down the road.

Marye Anne Fox: $350,000 woman 
Leadership worth investment Chancellor's raise excessive 

By BIYAN 'ISAO 
Opinion Editor 

YOU get what you pay for. When looking for something as imponant as a chan-cellor, you'd probably rather be shop-
ping at Harrod's than Wal-Mart - and with 
her impressive background, Chancellor Marye 
Anne Fox is certainly no blue-light special. If 
Fox can manage to continue UCSD's tradition 
of growth and academic quality in spite of cuts 
in state funding, she will be worth 
every penny. 

Science and Engineering Public Policy. For 
UCSD to land a chancellor as qualified as 
Fox at a time when both UC Berkeley and 
UC Santa Cru7. were also searching for 
chancellor candidates would understand-
ably require more money. Instead of wor-
rying about a few thousand dollars here or 
there, we should be ecstatic to have hired a 
chancellor with Fox's background. 

With concerns about the budget, a ris-
ing academic reputation and a growing stu-

dent body, it seems silly to be 
pinching pennies when it 

By CLAYTON WORFOLK 
Senior Staff Writer 

A mid the otherwise cheerful confirma-tion of new ucso Chancellor Marye Anne Fox in April came a startling 
side note: Fox was to receive a $3 50,000 salary, 
nearly 25 percent more than her predecessor 
and almost $60,000 more than the average UC 
chancellor, in addition to an $87,500 reloca-
tion allowance. 

Sandwiched between 
reports that budget cuts would 

administrators have been quick to defend the 
new chancellors' salaries. They argue that 
competitive salaries are necessary to artract 
top candidates, and that, in actuality, the aver-
age UC chancellor's salary remains less than 
the national average for the position (though 
only 2 percent less when compared with only 
public universities). Unfortunately, extending 
such a corporate model to the taXpayer-fund-
ed arena of public education - particularly 
during trying budgetary times - bodes trou-

ble for our institutions of learning. 
Take, for example. what many 

Having established itself as 
one of the nation's top schools 
in recent years, UCSD needs 
strong leadershi p to guide it 
through this critical time in its 
development. Time will tell 

PRO comes to leadership, and with over $1.8 billion dollars in rev-enue last year, $70,000 is defi-nitely spare change to UCSD. The ge::lerous package afforded 
force the University of 
California to tum away several 
thousand eligible students and a 
closed-door compact agree-
ment that opted to freeze 
salaries for UC employees and 

(ON critics, such as Claudia Horning, the Coalition of University Employees president, see as the domino effect of this trend. With 
each salary hike for a top-level 
recruit, the bar is raised nationally 

whether Fox is the right person 
for the job, but few could argue 
against the credentials and background for 
strong leadership she brings to the position. 

While a smaller raise may have had some 
symbolic value in a time when other univer-
sity staff salaries will remain stagnent, the 
reality is that a $70,000 raise and a few extra 
thousand a month for a house rental are 
peanuts compared to the experience she 
brings to this university. 

Having served on the executive commit-
tee of the National Academy of Sciences, 
her ample experience and connections in 
the research community could easily be 
worth several times her raise. Fox also· 
served as the vice president for research at 
the University of Texas, Austin, and the 
chancellor of North Carolina State 
University, two other major public research 
universities, proving that she has the experi-
ence necessary to succeed as UCSD's chan-
cellor. Fox also serves as the co-chair of the; . 
National Research Council's Government-
University-Industry roundtable, and sits on 
the President's Council of Advisors on 
Science and Technology and the National 
Academy of Sciences Committee on 

Fox could also help entice her 
to stay; which would benefit the 
school. 

Despite the raise, Fox still earns less than 
many peers at comparable public universi-
ties. New UC Berkeley chancellor Robert 
Birgeneau will earn $390,000, while 
University of Michigan President Mary Sue 
Coleman receives annual compensation of 
over $670,000. University of Texas 
Chancellor Marie: Yudof earned $787,000 in 
2003. Even schools with considerably less 
national exposure, such as the University of 
Hawaii and Louisiana State University at 
Baton Rouge, compensate their leaders 
much more generously than does UCSD, 
doling out over $590,000 apiece to their 
chancellors in 2003 . 

The UCSD chancellor is directly 
responsible for nearly 20,000 undergradu-
ates, 4,800 graduate and medical students, 
more than 16,000 staff members and 6,404 
faculty, malcing UCSD comparable to a 
Fortune 500 company, where CEOs rou-
tinely make tens of millions of dollars. 
Questioning the value of paying a little more 
for a little berter would be like questioning 
the value of spending a little more for better 
wings on an airplane.

dents, the timing of this near-
unanimous decision by the UC Board of 
Regents was anything but appropriate. 

The situation has only worsened since. In 
July, the Board of Regents lured Robert 
Birgeneau to the UC Berkeley chancellorship 
with a $390,000 salary, and in August, the 
finalized state budget failed to restore cost-()f-
living salary adjustments for UC employees.

An open letter to new freshmen Funding: Additional 
money could 

address concerns 
A UCSD veteran's take on how to survive and thrive in college 

Aftertaste 
Evelyn Hsieh 

Dear UCSD Newbie: 
Congratulations on making it 

to UC San Diego. Take one last 
longing look at Cal and UCLA (if 
you even care to) and then clear 
them out of your mind. Four years 
here are too few to nurture 
regrets. And if you do, you'll miss 
the hidden splendor of this par-
adise of learning. Yes, paradise of 
learning. Aren't you getting shiv-
ers down your spine already? 

Here 'are some handy thoughts 
that may be somewhat useful for 
your journey ahead. If anything, 
college is what you make of it. 
Take it from an old senior geezer 
like me. 

First, leave your car at home 
because, a) the parking permit will 
cost you a small fortune, b) as a 
freshman, there is little need to 
have a car and mostly because, c) 
there are desperate upperclassmen 
commuters out there and you do 
not want to get in their way. 
Parking spots go faster than hot-
cakes. When you hit our ripe old 
age, you'll understand. 

Remember the crunch of SATs, 
APs, and seven-hour school days? 
Put it all behind you. From here 
on out, your 4.1 GPA and 1300 
score will be relegated to the back 
of an admissions archive. You are 
starting afresh wi th peers of the 
same achievement level as you. 
Use your blank slate with wisdom 

- nobody will be checking your 
homework, and most professors 
don't care if you come to class or 
not. If you want to succeed, it will 
be on your initiative and yours 
alone . 

The temptation to ditch class 
will be imminent, even though 
there's only about 12 hours of it a 
week. Most of you will skip class 
one way or another. I'd advise 
grabbing a venti Frappuccino 
from Earl's Place 
and dragging your-

time to blow. More than ever, it 
is time to prove that "youth is 
wasted on the young" is a fallacy. 
Put your energy to good use. As 
you stroll down Library Walk 
these next couple weeks, you will 
be inundated with a flurry of 
fliers. Over 300 student organi-
zations - religious-, ethnic-, 
sports-related - will fight for 
your attention. It's good to dab-
ble in a couple and then focus on 

anyway. An impor-
tant thing to keep 
in mind here is that 
school is no longer 
free, I ike it has 
been all your life . 
Your parents are 
paying thousands 
of dollars for you to 

If you want to 
succeed, it wiU be on

including 
(warning: 
shameless plug 
ahead) writing 
for the 
GUllrdilln! 
Explore your 
interests and 
spend time 
making lots of 

know the real dish about your 
classes - it's like Us Weekly, but 
with useful class information 
instead of celeb trash. Along the 
same lines, most of you don't real-
ly know what to do with your life 
right now. And at the end of your 
four years, many of you still won't 
know. That's OK. Find what you 
like, and remember that UCSD is 
not a technical school. It is meant 
to imbue you with knowledge of 
and for the world, and will not 
necessarily offer a practical 
approach to making easy money. 
Don't be discouraged or scared; 
you will have eventual career 
prospects even if you aren't a 
super motivated pre-med student 
ready to tackle ophthalmology 
right out of undergrad. 

Life has a way of ironing itself 
out, so don't stress too much about 
the future. Instead, invest your 
time in people. Sign off AIM once 
in a while and walk over to have a 
real conversation. You'll meet life-
long friends here, and maybe even 
your spouse.

thanks to federal research grants, 
relatively little money is allocat-
ed to increase financial aid. In 
other words, it's sexy to have 
your name on a shiny new 
research building, but not so 
much on a scholarship fund. 
Even the Chancellor's 5K Run. 
established by former Chancellor 
Robert C. Dynes, raised only 
about $1 million for undergradu-
ate scholarships during Dynes' 
tenure as chancellor. 

That $1 million is not even 0.1 
percent of UCSD's operating 
budget for a single year and would 
pay for less than 70 fuji scholar-
ships at today's rate. UCSD cur-
rently enrolls over 20,000 under-
graduates. 

be here. 
And if you don't care about 

that, just remember that when 
finals week rolls around, there 
are no bonus homework points to 
make up for lack of preparation. 
J\1ost finals average around 50 
percent or more of your grade. 
That pretty much has "make-or-
break" wri tten all over it. 

With professors, get over the 
intimidation factor. Visit their 
office hours if you can, because 
when graduate or professional 
school application time rolls 
around, you'll be hurtin' for a 
professor buddy. Plus, they prob-
ably will teach you more outside 
of the classroom than in it if you 
get to know them. 

College is all about the free 
time. Even with the most diffi-
cult majors, there will still be 

friends - all in 
one! Getting involved, as cliche 
as it sounds, is one of the best 
ways to enjoy your 'time at 
UCSD. For all the talk of the 
boring campus climate and lack 
of a football team to amp up the 
atmosphere, you will find (legal 
and safe) fun if you go looking 
for it. 

You are going to groan when 
you encounter general education 
classes. Approach Humanities or 
Making of the Modern World 
with an open mind. Look at GEs 
as a buffet of goodies in which to 
indulge, and not as brussel sprouts 
to be shoved down your throat. 
Chances are most of you will 
switch majors, so choose GE 
classes wisely - they might just 
awaken your curiosity. Buy and 
read the CAPE (Course and 
Professor Evaluations) so you 

Visit the cliCk across from John 
Muir College. Take a long hard 
look at the Pacific and be thankful 
that you're at UCSD. You may be 
just one newbie in a sea of 300 
classmates in Center 101 - and 
one out of almost 4,000 freshmen 
- but your future is as limitless as 
that ocean and as beautiful as that 
fatty mansion by the cliffs. At the 
end of your four years, hopefully it 
will be apparent that even as one 
of 26,000 students, you've become 
one of a kind. 

Don't like Evelyn's flavor? E-mail 
her at ezhsieh@ucsd.edu 

With additional funds, many 
other student concerns could also 
be addressed: the parking situation 
could be improved, UCSD's sup-
port of A.S. and related program-
ming could be bolstered or a Black 
Studies major or minor could be 
implemented. UCSD could even 
build more dorms, so that students 
don't have to cram into "triples" 
that are roughly the size of 
Winnebagos. All of these improve-
ments could also help attract top 
students, who would likely balk at 
spending two years paying approD-
mately $800 a month to share a 
closet. 

So Chancellor Fox, the writing 
is on the wall. To be remembered as 
the chancellor who led UCSD out 
of the California budget crisis, all 
you have to do is show us the 
money.

istics of a CEO, the ivory towers of 
academia come crashing down. 

At a press conference following 
her confirmation, Fox stressed the 
need for "a passionate commitment 
£0 the ideal of scholarly achievement 
as a public trust." Might turning 
down an exorbitant raise be the per-
fect symbol of a chancellors own 
commionent to that ideal, especially 
in light of the hardships facing a uni-
versity such as ours? Or does service 
at one of the nation's top public uni-
versities necessitate the right price? 

For some, it seems, the answer 
is yes. 

"The job of a college president is 
worth not what the market will bear, 
but what the mission of the institu-

gerated. Moreover, with so much 
money being thrown around at the 
top levels. these raises will make lob-
bying lawmakers in Sacramento for 
lower fees or fewer cuts much more 
difficult. 

Allowing market forces to dic-
tate an administrator's salary and 
benefits is not the way to advance a 
university's endeavors; no matter 
what a chancellor like Fox has to 
offer a school like UCSD, the 
degree to which she is compensated 
must be decided holistically. As the 
undisputed best public college sys-
tem in the world, the University of 
California has the renown to stem 
this alarming trend, not succumb to 
it. We owe our students, employe::s

Diversity: Fox must bolster minority enrollment 
c:onrinUfd from I>DI' of 

ter job of integrating students of 
diverse backgrounds- at UCSD. 
It's a pd JOal; UCSD's current 
A&ian-Americ:an population COIl-
stitutes leas than 1 percent of the 
total student body, and the 2oo} 
admissions process saw a 9.6 per-
cent drop in the number of admit-
ted black students. 

Unfortunately, it's not unheard 
of for a challcellor's diversity-
improvement plan tQ fUl. Former 
UCSD Chancellor Robert C. 
Dynes created I 10-point plln to 
diwnify UCSD. The first point in 
said plan was to pronouoce Dynes 
the Chief Diversity Officer of 
UCSD (all hail); most of the nine 
othen dealt with similar token 
attempts to show concern for 
UCSD's lack of diversity, save for a 
pledse to increase admission of 
underrepresented minorides by 10 
percent each year (which obvious-
ly failed) and I commitment to 
creating modelscbools, such as the 
Preuss School, to assist minorities 
in preparing for college. The 
Preuss School has thus far been 
successful, but nevertheless has 
not yet done anything to increase 
the populltion of the mOlt under-
represented minority on campus . 
For Fox to begin IDIIring I differ-
ence, she must impose far more 
concrete, tangible resolutions. 

While F oz has little say ewer 
UC admissions procedures, there 
are other _ys to recruit a more 
diverse student body for UCSD. 
For example, more scholarships 
created speci6c:ally for deserving 
students of underrepreaented 
minority baclcpounds would SO a 
long way in opening UCSD's 
doors to a ~ varied student 

" Unfartur1atdy, it's not 
unheard affor a 

chancellor's 
dim-sity~impromnent 

plan to fail." 
body. If budget cuts should prove 
too great a barrier for financial 
incentive to students, then it's time 
for Fox to get creative and find 
other means to attract underrepre-
sented minorities to UCSD. 

Furthermore, Fox should focus 
on increasing campus awareness 

~d acceptance by providinr the 
necessary resources to establish a 
Black Studies progam at UCSD. 
The Black Student Union, the 
A.S. Council and the Thurgood 

Marshall CoHere Student Council 
have been campaigning for such a 
PnlJlllD, which is present already 
at six other UC campuses. 

In addition, Foz should strive 
to recruit a more racially diverse 
faculty, particularly in the history 
and social sciences departrnc:nts. 

, Of course, Fox's responsibilities 
extend much further than merely 
imprOYing ethnic diversity. At a 
school that is oriented toward sci-
ence and research, many can lose 
sight of other equally important 
disciplines, espt.cia1ly with a noted 
chemist as chancellor. Be-:ause of 
her lJec.qrouncI, Foz must be care-
ful to pay commensurate attention 
to all academic programs, even 
those outside her u:eas of interest. 

Fox could also focus on broad-
ening the diversity of students' 
backgrounds by doing more to 
welcome out-of-state and interna-
tional students. And, as UCSD's 
first female chancellor, Fox has 
already expressed a desire to even 
out the heavy gender disparity 
within the faculty. 

Hopefully, Fox will accomplish 
that and decide not to call it quits 
there. In its present state, UCSD 
offers a skewed perspective of life 
after university. In order to ade-
quately prepare students for the , 
real world, Fox must strive to 
bring more diversity to UCSD.

Study: Fewer than two-thirds of students graduate in six years 
Hispanics much less likely than whites to complete college, second report notes 

By WINNIE CHAN 
Staff Writer 

Despite the past four decades' 
high growth in the percentage of 
high school graduates attending 
college, only six out of 10 full-time 
students actually graduate with a 
bachelor's degree within six years, 
according to a new report. 

I n a job market tha t increas-
ingly requires skills acquired 
through higher education, the dis-
appointing rates may be hurting 
economic growth, the study by 
the nonprofit Education Trust 
found. 

"Over half a million collegians 
every year ... fall short of acquiring 
the credentials, skills and knowl-
edge they seek," said Kevin Carey, 
the report's author and a senior 
policy analyst with the group, 
which advocates higher acad-:mic 
achievement. "This is a huge 
national problem because as 
economies in other nations mature 
and evolve, external job pressure is 
creeping further up the income and 
skills ladder." 

For UCSD, the graduation 
rate is well above the national 
average. Eighty-three percent of 
the freshman class of 1997 gradu-
ated within six years in the most 
recent six-year period, according 
to campus Director of Student 
Research Bill Armstrong. 

Armstrong credits the better 
performance to student achieve-
ment. 

"Tbe kind of student who 
chooses UCSD ... comes here 
expecting to be challenged, n 
Armstrong said. "[They] tend to be 
very studious, hardworking and 
more prepared for college." 

Congressional Republicans, 

whose Higher Education Act 
reauthorization proposal has faced 
opposition from higher education 
lobbyists, cited the report as proof 
of the failure of advocacy groups 
to address high dropout rates . 

"[We] have yet to hear a formal 
response from the higher educa-
tion lobbying community," wrote 
lawmakers John A. Boehner (R-
Ohio) and Howard P. McKeon 
(R-Calif.) in a letter to the educa-
tion associations, in response to 
criticism from groups that their 
massive higher education bill fails 
to address the needs of students. 

However, the American 
Council on Education, a major 
association that represents educa-
tion institutions, called the report 
inaccurate and faulty. The 
Education Trust report is highly 
inaccurate because it relies on mis-
leading federal statistics, said 
A.C.E. director of public affairs 
Tim McDonough. 

Under the current methodolo-
gy, the Department of Education 
only counts the success of full-
time first-year students who com-
plete a degree within six years. It 
does not include students who 
transfer from other campuses, and 
instead counts them as dropouts 
from the school they transferred 
from. Also, current calculations 
exclude part-time college stu-
dents. 

"If you started as a full-time 
student and then changed to part-
time, you would be considered a 
dropout," McDonough said. 
"We're ready to help [Congress], 
but we think that graduation rates 
are a lot higher than they [seem]. 
We need to start working from 
accurate numbers to see what 
we're dealing with." 

Hispanic rates laggiog behind 

Though the Education Trust 
report found the national rates a 
worry for all ethnic groups, a sepa-
rate study by the nonprofit Pew 
Hispanic Center suggests that the 
problem is even more pronounced 
for Hispanic students. 

The report found that, although 
Hispanic high school graduates are 
just as likely as their white counter-
parts to enter college, Hispanic 
undergraduates are almost 25 per-
cent less likely to receive a bache-
lor's degree. 

At nonselective institutions, 81

tor of pubic" 

percent of white students receive a 
bachelor's degree, compared to 
only 57 percent of Latinos, accord-
ing to the report. 

A number of reasons account 
for the differences, according to 
Patrick Velasquez, director of 
UCSD's Office of Academic 
Support and Instructional 
Services. 

"Th.e [biggest] problem lies in 
the failure of institutions to be 
open and accessible to Chicano 
[and Latino] students and validate 
their presence," he said. "Students 
feel neglected and not represented 

in the staff and curriculum." 
While the graduation rate for 

Hispanic undergraduates is high-
er at UCSD than at other cam-
puses, they still has the lowest 
five-year completion rate of any 
ethnic group on campus and 
Velasquez still believes that the 
numbers are a serious problem, 
one that the school is not proper-
ly addressing. . 

"[There has] never been a com-
prehensive institution wide focus 
on this problem," Velasquez said. 
"I don't thinlc they're doing 
enouJth." 

Though "symbolic gestures," 
lilce the creation of the Preuss char-
ter school, may bring some 
Hispanic students to the campus, 
Velasquez said they will not solve 

the problem. 
In addition to academic prepa-

ration, the report from the Pew 
Hispanic Center attributed a col-
lection of other outside factors to 
the success of the students in col-
lege. 

One such factor is the pressure 
on Hispanic students, said Liliana 
Corona, a part-time student at 
Miramar College. 

"Working in our culture is a 
more realistic way to get by, rather 
than getting a degree," Corona 
said. "College wasn't stressed at my 
house. Doing well was stressed, but 
not going straight into a universi-
ty."

Eligibility: Proposal hurts 
minority students, critics say 

continued from page J 
an attempt to reduce the number of 
students eligible for admission to the 
state's most prestigious public uni-
versity. 

The proposals have come as a 
result of a May study by the 
California Postsecondary Education 
Commission, which found that too 
many of the states seniors meet the 
university's minimum application 
requirements. 

Under the state's Master Plan 
for Higher Education, a blueprint 
outlining the role of California's 
university and college institutions, 
the UC system must select from the 
state's top 12.5 percent; CPEC 
found that more than 14 percent 
are eligible for admission. 

In response, the UC faculty-
run Academic Senate has 
approved a plan to reduce the eli-
gibility rate to Master Plan levels, 
a move critics have said will hurt 
the poor and raci al minori ties. 
Groups like the UC Student 
Association have also criticized 
the board for first taking up the 
issue at its july hearing, when few 
affected students knew of the 
event or were able to attend. 

again until the board meeting in 
late September. 

InJuly, a separate Regents' com-
mittee on admissions voted in favor 
of all changes, leaving the GPA 
hike one step away from approval 
by the full board. 

"It seemed like we needed a lit-
tle more time for discussion," said 
Student Regent Jodi L. Andersen, 
one of only two committee mem-
bers voting against sending the 
changes to a full-board vote. 

The Greenlining Institute, a Ii h-
eraJ Berlceley-based think tanIc, and 
various other students spoke out 
against raising grade requirements at 
the July meeting, arguing that the 
new standards would disproportion-
ately hurt the students already most 
underrepresented on UC campuses. 

Admitting that minorities 
would feel a bigger burden than 
white students, UCSD chemistry 
professor Barbara Sawrey said the 
plan was the best the Academic 
Senate could come up with. She 
said that the plan would have the 
"least negative impact" on under-
represented student groups. 
Sawrey chaired the senate's admis-
sions committee that wrote the 
recommendations. 

THINK OUTSIDE 

FOUR PERPENDICULAR SIDES ON A 

GEOMETRICALLY SQUARED BASE. 

"It was not open, it was not 
healthy for the university and it 
definitely did not allow all of the 
stakeholders to voice their opinions 
before the changes were made," 
UCSA President Jennifer Lilla said. 

While it approved changes in 
the way the system calculates GPAs 
of applicants at the time, the board 
decided to posrpone its vote on 
whether to raise the minimum 
GPA needed for UC eligibility 
from 2.7 to 3.1 until a special 
August session at the request of 
some Regents. In August, the UC 
Office of the President announced 
that the vote would be postponed 

"What we were looking for was 
a way that was fair to everybody," 
she said. 

Lawrence Pi tts, the chair of the 
senate's Academic Council, also 
backed the plan. 

"Reducing the size of our eligi-
bility pool is not a happy task, 
because we all know that access to a 
high-q\!ality college education is 
critical to the future of California 
and ·its people," Pitts told the 
regents in July. "But the faculty have

chancellor also promi~ to work on 
making college an accessible reality 
for underrepresented and low-

"The emphasis [is) on access and

Chandler, who is currendy tak-

research as a visiting scholar, said 
in an e-mail that she expects to 
return to UCSD next year, but has 
not made any firm commianents

ing challenges, Fox said. 

Fox said she has enjoyed a wel-

In addition to funding for stu-

fall 2005 - and the university's 
Institute of Labor and 
Employment. 

According to the UC Student 
Association, the final budget did 
not have everything students 
wanted, but was far better than 
Schwarunegger's ori~ propos-
al, according to UCSA President 
Jennifer Lilla. During negotia-
tions at the state's capital, the 
group organized a student 
marathon around the legislative 
building to rally support among 
lawmakers. It alsO' joined State 
Treasurer Phil Angelides and the 
California Faculty Association in a 
radio ad, featuring "American 
Idol" judge Randy Jackson, in sup-
port of higher education funding. 

Those efforts paid off, accord-
ing to Lilla. 

MWe have certainly claimed it as 
a student victory because I'm con-
fident that if we had not done what 
we had done, we would be a lot 
worse off now," she said. 

However, the university's deci-
sion to offer freshman enrollment 
only to students who originally 

accepted the transfer guarantee on 
some campuses has angered 
Assemblyman Joe Simitian (D-Palo 
Alto), who says UC officials misled 
the legislature about how it would 
use the extra money. 

Of the 1,700 students who 
received a GTO offer at UCSD, 
only the 10 percent who accepted 
were mailed letters in August saying 
they could enter as freshmen instead. 
Out of those 149 students, 78 tOOk 
up the offer to enter as freshmen, 
according to university records. 

Because of the budget'S late tim-
ing, the 78 will not begin until 
winter quarter. As a result, they will 
lose their first- and second-year 
housing guarantees that are nor-
mally offered to freshmen, accord-
ing to Housing and Dining 
Director Mark Cunningham. 

"I haven't spoken with the cam-
pus as to what priority if any they 
might have next year, but I'm sure it 
will be reviewed - and I'll person-
ally commit to addressing it - due 
to the challenging circumstances 
that they have faced with the change 
in direction," he stated in an e-mail. 

For those who did not accept 
the UC system's original GTO 
offer in the spring, at issue was the 
amount of space and class offer-
ings, .and the system's most crowd-
ed campuses - Berkeley, Los 
Angeles and San Diego - just 
could not find room for them, 
according to Mae W. Brown, assis-

tant vice chancellor of admissions 
and enrollment services at UCSD. 

The rest of the students who 
received a GTO offer were offered 
freshman spaces at a different cam-
pus, Eisenman said. Some accepted 
and will attend a campus other than 
their first choice. 

Yet that was not what the uni-
versity committed to doing during 
budget negotiati<m, according to a 
scaa:ment &an Simitian. 

"Franldy, I'm disappointed that 
UC is not fully honoring its 
declared commitment to the legis-
lature and to these students," 
Simitian said, calling for state hear-
ings later in September to examine 
the issue. "These kids were told 
they would have been accepted but 
for a lack of funds. The funds have 
been restored and the kids are still 
being denied admission [to the 
three campuses)." 

Despite :he controversy, 
approximately 1,500 students of 
the nearly 8,000 who received the 
original deferred enrollment offer 
said by the August deadline that 
they would attend a UC campus 
their freshman y~ar. 

Eisenman also said that under 
the 2004 compact with the state, 
the university expects to offer 
direct enrollment to all eligible 
applicants in the spring.

GPA: Regents put off final 
vote after concerns voiced 

coruinued from page I I 
achieves this reduction sensibly, by 
placing a priority on academic 
achievement in school and avoiding 
a dramatic impact on any single 
group of students." 

However, Lilla and others criti-
cized the recommendations for dis-
regarding the large margin of error 
in the CPEe report on which the 
proposal is based. Because the state 
commissi<>n used a sample of only 
48 schools to estimate eligibility for 
1,005 public high schools in 
California, its data calculated only a 
rough estimate for the actual eligi-
bility rate of seniors. 

Retired ue Berkeley physicist 
Charles Schwartz, a known critic of 
the board, told the Regents that the 
data had such high potential for 
error, it was uncertain whether the 
GPA hike was needed to bring eli-
gibility down to 12 .5 percent. He 
questioned why the recommenda-
tions presented to the regents left 
out that there was a 4O-percent 
chance the actual eligibility rate 
was low enough to make the mini-
mum grade changes unnecessary, 
according to the statistical model in 
the ePEC study. 

"The thing that really upsets me 
most of all is that there is absolute-
ly no mention, no discussion of that 

very standard professional question 
of uncertainty of data in any of the 
UC reports produced by the 
Academic Senate for the Board," 
Schwam said. "It is unprofessional 
to the extreme. If this was an over-
sight, well then someone should be 
embarrassed and fix it. If this was 
the deliberate suppression of things 
that might create too much discus-
sion, then it is gross dishonesty, and 
that is really bad. " 

The authors of the plan also 
used other data to verify the esti-
mate and came up with the same 
numbers. Sawtey said in defense of 
the plan. She also explained that 
under the proposal. minimum 
grades would not be raiscd until 
2006. giving UC administrators 
plenty of time to malce final adjust-
ments as more accurate data 
became available. 

By approving the new require-
ments early, students will have an 
opportunity to raise their own 
grades to meet the tougher stan-
dards, Sawtey said. 

The regents are expected to 
decide whether to go ahead with 
the plan at their meetings sched-
uled for Sept. 22 and Sept. 23 .

they are a product of the hardships 
facing the sute," Eisenman said. 
"The budget cuts have forced the 
UC to make very difficult choices 
about student fees ." 

The decision affects approxi-
mately 3,000 snidents, who were 
originally enroUed in one of the 
university's law, medical or other 
professional schools in December 
2002, when the lawsuit was first 
filed. UCSD has 250 medical and 
25 phannacy students, whose fees 
will be spared an increase of 
berween $4,500 and $5 ,200, 
according to David N . Bailey, the 
deputy dean of the campus' School 
of Medicine. . 

The university will absorb the 
loss in revenue and operate at a 
defici t in hopes of recovering the 
money in November, when the 
lawsuit will go to trial, Bailey said. 

"Definitely, it's a relief," said 
Anupa Menon, a third-year stu-
dent at Berkeley's Boalt Hall 
School of Law and one of the first 
students to sign onto the lawsuit. 
"I was concerned about my level of 
debt after graduating. This defi-
nitely takes a load off of my shoul-
ders." 

Menon said she chose to attend 
the school because the sute-subsi-
dized university offered a better 
price than other private institu-
tions. Had she known that the 
price would not last, Menon might 
have gone elsewhere, she said. 

The lawsuit argues that promo-
tional materials in the school's cat-
alog promised that tuition would 
remain the same during the stu-
dents' entire period of instruction,

a statement that attorneys for the 
students claim constitutes I binding 
contract between the UC system 
and the students in its professional 
schools. However, the university 
has said sUtements in the catalog 
were old and updated notices on its 
Web site waived any fee guaran-
tees. 

In a technical decision last 
February, the judge ruled against 
the university and said the updated 
notices did not void the original 
promise of Oat fees . 

Although it won't help him per-

" The budget cuts have farced the UC to make 
some difficult choices 
about student fees. " 
- HInIn Eisel'." uc 

spoIcesInM 
sonaUy, Berkeley law school gradu-
ate Mo K3shrniri said the August 
injunction forecasts a student victo-
ry in the sui t that he originally 
filed . Unable to raise money to 
cover higher tuition and unwilling 
to take on more debt - he owed 
$120,000 upon graduation last 
spring - Kashmiri said fee hikes 
caused him to drop out of school 
for a semester and work to raise 
extra money. After coming back, he 
took on an unusuaUy heavy course 
load to graduate quicldy. 

While the class-action suit still 

carries his name, he believes the 
focus should be on the university's 
failure to "stick to its promises." 

"I know that it's a time of budget 
cuts," said Kashrniri, pointing out 
that salaries for new administrators 
have continued to increase. "But 
they can't balance the budget on 
the backs of students. Students are 
being forced out because of the fee 
increases ... 

Should the students win, the 
university will have to refund all of 
the fee increases made after the stu-
dents first enrolled, according to 
Danielle E. Leonard, one of the 
students' attorneys. 

Because all of the money has 
been spent on UC expenditures, 
the university will either need a 
state bailout package should it 
lose - such help unlikely in the 
current budget crisis - or long-
term loans to refund the money, 
Bailey said. 

The judge'S injunction did not 
address two other parts of the suit, 
which call for a refund of fee hikes 
for all UC students made in spring 
and summer of 2003, after the uni-
versity sent out billing sutements 
and accepted payments from some 
students. 

However, Leonard said she 
believes the students will prevail on 
aU three counts. 

A Maryland law firm is also 
helping with the students' case. 
The firm was unsuccessful in a sim-
ilar 2003 suit when it represented 
students in a class-action against 
that sute's public university system.

The Pixies' reunion tour headlines RIMAe 
BY IAN s. PORT, HIATUS EDITOR 

Reunion tours are just less idealistic versions of the real thing: 
de-glamorized rock 'n' roll stars haul out their amps and stuff 
their spare tires into stage-fri.endly clo~g. in the hopes .of 
reviving their legacy and making a few (mIllIon) bucks, while 
well-off fans cough up the dough for expensive tickets, then head 
to the (insert name of big corporation here) Outdoor 
Amphitheater for a few $9 glasses of chardonnay while trying to 
remember the lyrics to songs they loved decades ago. For the 
most part, both parties are honest about their motivations. We 
all need money, and we all want to feel cool. 

But what about when that band isn't Jefferson Starship or the 
Eagles? What about when that tour plays college campuses 
instead of lawny yuppie hideouts? What if the music is the 
snarling, harmony-laden attack of alt~~native. rock icons ~e 
Pixies? Wait ... what the hell are the Pmes domg on a reunIOn 
tour anyway? stery Clltilllld .. pg 18

Pixies: Alt-rockers' old songs 
find new fans on reunion tour 

continued from page '7 
Though the "real" answer to 

this question may be in the para-
graph above. another technically 
correct answer is, kicking ass. In a 
summer where it seemed like only 
Prince and Madonna could win 
the miserlj' masses away from the 
TV and into the stadium for a 
pop/rock show, the Pixies' reunion 
concert tour has been - and, as it 
hits Rimae Arena Sept. 21, contin-
ues to be - wildly successful, 
especially for a band whose most 
successful album topped out at 
number 98 on the American charts 
and whose videos never got more 
than a sigh from MTv. 

Their performance at this 
year's Coachella Festival earned 
rave reviews, and kept their ship 
afloat through the high-ticket-
price storm that sunk Lollapalloza 
(tickets for their UCSD show are a 
not-too-bad 536). 

But for Frank Black (or Black 
Francis, as he was known first to 
Pixies' fans more than a decade 
ago), Kim Deal, Joey Santiago and 
David Lovering, reuniting the 
Pixies has not only meant the 
usual trappings of defrosted star-
dom (DVDs, magazine covers, a 
new album?). it has confronted 
them with the reputation they've 
earned - now as more than just 
masterminds of their own brand of 
gritty pop. 

Looking back from here, it's 

Black's ability to transition from 
wispy ramble to salacious howl in 
the course of a line, and in the sim-
ple, on/off punches of Lovering's 
drumming were the lessons of all 
the rock music previous to them 
distilled into a tense, inane, glee-
fully sarcastic lecture by professors 
of the modern teenage mental life. 

And, shockingly, a lot of people 
were there to notice it. 

The follow up to Surfer Rosa, 
1989's decidedly less-hellish 
Doolittle, debuted at an astonishing 
number 8 on the UK charts. Their 
most acceS!'ible, essential and suc-
cessful album, Doolink took the 
hints of pop sensibility already in 
the Pixies' music and presented 
them, with the help of producer 
Gill Nonon, somewhat nearer to 
the front of the ml.£c, albeit still 
with plenty of raucous guiw ener-
gy and bestial growl by Black. 

The surf-rock-inspired MWave 
of Mutilation," about driving a car 
into the ocean, became a top-ten 
rock hit, and the gorgeous lament 
"Here Comes Your Man" took the 
Pixies sound to its poppiest 
enreme. 

But the album's finest track is 
the radio hit "Monkey Gone to 
Heaven" - its abrasive guitars 
clearing to reveal a longing har-
mony held up by Black and Deal, 
which is renewed with guitar 
crunch then fades away into 

easy to see how the 
Pixies music was 
both the impetus 
and inspiration for 
much of the alter-
native rock explo-
sion of the early 
1990s: the band's 
signature dynamic, 
which featured 
abrupt loud/quiet 
and start/stop 
shifts, became the 
MO for practically 
every band from 
Nirvana, who 
brought Francis' 
songwriting style 
its first platinum 
success, to Linkin 

" 

Black's whisper: 
..... and ifthe man is 
five/ And if the 
devil is sill .... " 
Then he blasts, 
"Then GOD is It will be 

a legendary night 
for those fans 

when the Pixies, 
discarnate 

forefathers of 
modem rock, 

seven!" at his 
primitive best 
while the guitar 
and drums come 
pounding back into 
the chorus: "This 
monkey's gone to 
heaven." 

The Pixies 
would explore 
their sound further 
into the nineties, 
but after two more 
albums, they'd had 

appear onstage." 
Park, who sell mil-
lions of records today with 
arguably the same technique. 

The Pixies began as an idea in a 
San Juan bar: While Black was 
studying Spanish in Puerto Rico in 
1986, as an exchange student from 
the University of Massachuserts, 
he made the sudden decision not 
to go back to school and instead 
move to Boston to form a band. 

He talked his old friend from 
California, Joey Santiago, into 
playing guitar for him. The two of 
them found "Pixie" defined in the 
dictionary as a "mischievous little 
elf," and named themselves after 
it. 

After placing an ad for a some-
one who liked both Husker Du 
and Peter, Paul and Mary, as spec-
ified by Black, the two met bassist 
Kim Deal, who joined the pair and 
advised them to recruit Lovering 
on drums. 

The band started playing 
shows around Boston, but their 
break came after a tour with 
Throwing Muses, when the leg-
endary British indie label 4AD 
heard a Pixies demo and offered to 
sign the band. 

Listening to the Pixies' first 
full-length, 1988's raunchy Surf". 
R01II, it's hard to believe that this 
turbulence - the sound of the 
manic Black shrieking over his 
stop-start guitar chords with the 
band right behind him, the whole 
clamor wailing demonically (or 
gleaming with heartbreaking 
charm and full pop harmony) -
would appeal to enough people to 
headline a mid-week show at the 
Che Cafe, let alone become a col-
lege radio hit. 

But in the dueling guitars, in 

enough. Their last 
studio album, Trampe I.e MM, 
was written entirely by Black 
(Deal had contributed notable 
tracks to earlier albums), perhaps 
signifying the fragmenting rela-
tionship between the two band-
mates. One day, before lie had told 
any of the other mem~ Black 
announced on the radio that the 
band was breaking up. And, aside 
from a few CDs of unreleased 
material, that was the end of the 
Pixies. 

Their legacy was carried on, 
however, by a decade of rocli 'n' 
roll: the early- '9Os llternative rock 
explosion, powered by songs of 
bestial sarcasm and dirty, ironic 
pop, owed much of its sound to the 
then-dying Pixies. Grunge icons 
Nirvana sought out the raw pro-

. duction of Albini, who worked on 
Swfrr &sa, for their masterpiece 
Iff Uttro. Radiohead claim them to 
this day as a major influence. u do 
countless other bands in the pOst-
punk/alternative world. 

When the Pixies hit the stage 
Sept. 21, they'll ~ faced with an 
audience well aware of their 
importance. In the years since 
they were last together, they have 
only increased in notoriety, with a 
huge international fan base that 
consists largely of listeners too 
young to have seen the Pixies 
before, and many who wouldn't 
know of them were it not for their 
high-profile followers. It will be a 
legendary night for those fans 
when the Pixies, discarnate forefa-
thers of modern rock, appear 
onstage. It will be very diff.:rent 
from a typical re'Plion tour -
even if, on the surface, it's the 
same. 

TUESOAY, SEPTEMBER 21,2004 ruE UCSD GUARDIAN WELCOME WEEK SECTION 19 

Street Scene aimed for Coachella Lite, still packed good tunes 
A Tribe Called Quest, Faa Fighters save two-day festival of the parking lot 
By CODY NUOUIS 

Contributing Yhiter 

he first word I could come up T with to describe the new Street Scene setting, out of the 
streets of the Gaslamp and 

into the parking lots of Petco Park? 
Underwhelming. 

Gone were the days of the 
Street Scene Experience, replete 
with a menagerie of eclectic and 
interesting foods, shops and peo-
ple. Instead of a West Coast Mardis 
Gras for everyone over 21, we were 
treated to a Coachella Lite for the 
kiddies. It was heavy on the money-
making, but light on the character 
that has become such a beloved 
part of Street Scene. 

Patti Smith: The veteran 
punkstress emerged onto the stage 
amid cheers from the oldest people 
I'd seen since I arrived. 

Looking like a wizened man-
zanita branch, dressed in a torn 
shirt bearing a self-inflicted peace 
sign, the 57-year-old played a set 
demonstrating the range of her 
music, from slow minimalism to 
fiery punk rock. Voting was 
encouraged early and often during 
the show, which climaxed with 
1988's "People Have the Power." 
With only two minutes left in the 
show, Smith made sure the audi-
ence got the message to "fucking 
vote" before strapping on an out-
of-tune guitar, lending some dis-
torted noise to her band's thunder-
storm of a closer, b;eaking off all of 
the strings one by one, and remind-
ing us all what "punk rock" really 
means. 

Jimmy Eat World: The defec-
tion of these Ariwna-hailing emo-
avengers to the pop radio airwaves 

has incurred the wrath of many for-
mer fans in recent years. 

Luckily, at this year's Street 
Scene, Jimmy Eat World made sure 
not to let down any of their fans, 
playing new and old hits alike. 
They began with a shout-out to 
their neighboring home state, and 
then the title track of their yet-to-
be-released album, Futurts, which 
looks to be a slightly boring sound-
alike to the 1999 masterpiece 
Clarity. 

They filled out the rest of the 
show with the well-loved "Lucky 
Denver Mint," "Blister" and 
"Goodbye Sky Harbor." From 
their popularizing Blad Amtri"m, 
they played through energy-filled, 
audience-chanting versions of the 
title track, along with "A Praise 
Chorus," "The Middle," "Your 
House," "Sweetness" and "Get It 
Faster." From the upcoming 
Futures, they played the monosyl-
labic singles "Kill" and "Pain," as 
well as "Nothing Wrong," which 
made it sound like Jimmy Eat 
World brushed up on their emo 
with repeated listenings of 
Weezer's Pinlurttm. 

Not to disappoint the few 
diehard fans in the audience, "No 
Sensitivity" was included off of 
their split EP with Jebediah. Like 
or hate their brand of hyper-pop-
erno, Jimmy Eat World can put 
together a damn entertaining 
show. -

A Tribe Called Quest: These 
reunited legends of rup-hop - Ali 
Shan-eed Muhammed, Phife Dawg 
and Q-Tip - played for the first 
time in ·seven years to an audience 
of adoring fans, young and old, on 
the very streets of our own San 
Diego. 

From the very inception of this 
Street Scene's lineup, this was des-
tined to be its greatest moment. 
Trading lines like the childhood 
friends they are, A Tribe Called 
Quest assaulted the audience with 
air-thickening jazz loops and lyri-
cal precision, still sharp after seven 
years. For many, it was a chance to 
see the group that typified the 
early '90s for them, when they 
were in college and still listened to 
cool music. For others, it was a 
chance to hear live what had been 
heard on the stereo hundreds of 
times. 

For everyone, it was akin to a 
revival meeting, hot and claustro-
phobic, but thick with love. They 
rocked everyone the fuck down. If 
you weren't there, you missed it. If 
you were there, you won't forget 
it. 

Blackalicious: Straight outta 
Sac-town, Gift of Gab and Chief 
Xcel were joined by labelmate 
Lateef the Truth Speaker for a 
heart-filled show. In addition to 
playing brilliant tracks from NIA 
and Blazing ATTUIlI, the group 
banged out songs from Gift of 
Gab's solo album, 4th Dimensional 
Rockttships Going Up. 

The futuristic funk of the A,.,.UIlI 
tracks allowed Xcel to lay down his 
own brilliance on the steel wheels, 
supported by a brilliant female 
backup vocalist. It was a chance to 
sit back and listen to the skills. 

Toots and The Mayuls: Toots 
Hibbert, the legend, the progenitor 
of reggae, sang and danced his way 
into the hearts of an audience com-
prised of young Sublime fans and 
middle-aged drunks. 

Publicizing his new album True 
Lovt, Toots invoked a time when live 

A Tribe. fiully: Q·tip, of the revered hi~op trio A Tribe called Quest, perfomed 
with his band mates for the first time in seven years at this yea~s Street Scene. 

shows were the ultimate manifesta-
tion of the artist. He played all his 
hits, from "Monkey Man" to 
"Pressure Drop," danced his famous 
side-to-side dance and sang with the 
soul of Jamaica. 

Though dancing to the music 
was, at first, ill-received by the 
younger crowd, the heaps of gmja 
smoked almost communally by the 
audience effected a change from 
audience stoicism to the dancing, 
shouting passion that Toots expects 
from his audience. 

By the end of his set, everyone 
was singing along to such famous 
songs as ·Country Road" and the 
often covered .. 54-46 (That's My 
Number)." There's nothing like a 
good reggae show to perk up your 
spirits, and the Maytals could playa 
good reggae show out of an iron 
lung. 

Foo Fighters: Dave Grohl just 

wants to have a good time. Filled 
with energy from the start, the 
famous Foos ripped through 
songs from every album, includ-
ing such nonsingles as "Hey, 
Johnny Park! " and "Stacked 
Actors." 

The memorable moment of 
the show? When a fan made his 
way onstage to shake hands with 
Dave, and was asked if he had the 
balls to take his balls out for the 
3adience. After the big·screen-
projected cat brains were put 
away, Dave responded, "You 're 
awesome, dude. Nice balls. Now 
get the fuck off my stage." Dave 
then went back to the superhits 
without missing a beat, occasion-
ally musing upon the big deal 
made over balls. 

But hey, the man's already 
made legendary music. Let's just 
let him have a Iinle fun. 



20 WELCOME WEEK SECTION THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Blood, romance in zombie comedy 
JShaun of the Dead' a refreshing departure 

By vu MAl 
Staff Writer 

Kill your stepf. ather, grab your girlfriend, hide in the local pub and have yourself a pint 
while you wait for a zombie out-
break to blow over - a perfect 
plan if there ever was one. 

Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright 
bring the dark comedy "Shaun of 
the Dead" to the States to shove a 
little bit of British humor into a 
classic film genre: the zombie 
movie. Pegg plays Shaun, a thir-
tysomething chap infected with a 
severe case of emotional inepti-
tude and chronic tedium -
though he's clueless to the despair 
of his predicament. But when his 
girlfriend, played by Kate 
Ashfieldi finally dumps him, and 
his inferior co-workers treat him 
like trash, he realizes that his life 
has reached the ultimate low. 

That is, until the entire north 
side of London breaks out with a 
vicious case of flesh-eating zombie 
mania. Suddenly Shaun is forced 
to take initiative in a plan for sur-
vival in this strangely funny film. 

"Shaun of the Dead" may be 
just a zombie film spoof, but its 
satisfying intelligence and 
straight-faced wit take the unnec-
essary vulgarity out of the film and 
replace it with great hilarity. It has 
the campy appeal of a J ohn Waters 
film and the biting, dry humor of 
Monty Python yet at the same 
time perks up horror fans with a 
few very gory details. Its incredi-
bly cheesy but incredi bly gra tify-
ing at the same time. 

"Shaull" heightens its humor 
through its excellent British cast. 
Nick Frost plays Ed - the lazy

Film 
REVIEW 

slob friend - with such superb 
detail that the plot of the film 
would go bland otherwise. 
Supporting actors Dylan Moran, 
L,!cy David and Penelope Wilton 
each add an extra comical element 
to the film as the up-tight friends 
and painfully oblivious "mum," 
respectively. Pegg joins the team 
as the main character sealing the 
clever juices into the film's plot 
with his purposefully nonchalant 
and unaware humor. 

Unfortunately, there is no such 
thing as a perfect film, and the 
conclusion of the film is far from 
ideal. What could have been a sur-
prising twist ends up pulling the 
film into a rushed effort to finish. 
Perhaps writers Pegg and Wright 

telt the bulk of their film was 
already so stuffed with quality that 
a little bit of a lame ending would-
n't hurt anyone - who mows? 
Either way, the ending of "Shaun" 
does not suck enough to drag the 
coolness of the film into the toilet 
and can be forgiven. 

If you're looking for a good, 
hearty comedy that doesn't run 
dry on punch-line jokes and car-
ries a fun, trite storyline, "Shaun 
of the Dead" is the perfect film. 
It's got the humor, the romance 
(sort 01), the quirlcy details and 
some gloriously gory, stomach-
churning zombie ass-kiclcing.

San Diego Film Festival cures summer blockbuster blues 
Over 1,200 local, foreign, independent films featured at annual Gaslamp jubilee 
By ANNA DYLEWSKA 

Senior Staff Writer 

NoW that the mind-numbing season of summer block-busters has come to an end, 
and the more provocative fall films 
have only started m~king their 
appearance, what is there to do in 
the meantime? How about cruising 
over to downtown San Diego to 
watch some independent films' 

The third annual San Diego 
Film Festival will be held in the 
Gaslamp Quarter between Sept. 29 
and Oct. 3. The fest will feature 80 
film screenings, including 22 fea-
ture films, five documentaries and 
5J shorts. All films will be screened 
at the Pacific Gaslamp 15 Theatre, 
located at the corner of Fifth 
Avenue and G Street. In addition, 
there will be six panels and semi-
nars, a glamorous red carpet open-
ing celebration and several ZI-and-
over festival parties. 

More than 1,200 entries were

"Bad Meat" tells the story of 
two ill-fated lovers who try to kid-
nap a U.S. Congressman (played by 
none other than Chevy Chase) for 
ransom. 

"Nothing. WIthout You" docu-
ments a man's experiment in com-
munity as he sets out in the nude 
and without water, food or a single

figure who called for armed resis-
tance against the violent Jim Crow 
South. 

Fourteen-year-old Celeste

a film she wrote about a lonely 
teenage girl who leaves behind 
her chaotic, drug-tainted life to

However, students receive a 
20-percent discount on all passes.

album reviews SDMA: 
Awards benefit 
gives the pick 
to local fans 

Jimmy La Valle's one-man band the A1bwn Leaf is the hot-sbit indie act at the San Diego Music Awards this year, and it deserves to be. 
The band's latest release, ht II SIIfr PIMt, is a 

A strangled voice sardonically belts out forceful, nonsensical lyrics while back-ground singers echo back harmonies over 
chunky, retro-punk riffs md simple basslines. 

It's strange that the popularity . of Scissor Sisters bypassed America IlIId headed, strai,ht to the UK instead, where they were 
welcomed with open arms. ThanIcfully, 
though, their album was finally released here 
and we can relish in being transported back to 

temptingly lonely trip ough the gallery of 
dreamy atmospherics and skittering beats we've 
come to expect &om the A1bwn Leaf, with one 
difference: laValle adds vocals to his songs for 
the fint time on In II &1ft P"'u, and wisely spreads 
them out, giving the albwn -lilce his songs - a 
feeling of progression, as if we're hearing him 
change with each passing measure. 

On the instrumental tracks that malce up most 
of the album, LaVane focuses on creating room-
filling layers of sound with Iceyboard, organ, cello 
IlIId the occasional guitar. 

His songs are dramatic stories: they fade in 
slowly, as layers of melody intertwine, the motion 

If this description sounds vaguely like the 
Hives, you might be on to something; Much 
publicity has been thrown around how Sahara 
Hotnights' lead singer Maria Andersson and 
Hives vocalist Pete A1rnqvist are the quintes-
sential Swede punk-rock couple, and it seems 
that quite a bit of musical influence has passed 
between the two. 

But comparisons aside, lOss ,,,,d Tell is a 
neat little half-hour of girl-group punk, and 
Sahara Hotnights' sound - a quaint collec-
tion of riffs and loud-but-not-screaming 
lyrics - is clearly on par or above the quali-
ty of the Donnas. 

the gold, glittery, drug-induced wonders of the 
19705 disco club era. 

The band delves into eclectic genres of music 
as inspiration for their debut self-tided album. 
The album opens up with the piano-thwnping 
anthem, "Laura." This is quicldy followed by the 
young-EJton John-esque "Take Your Mama," 
.replete with kitsch (in a good way of course), and 
a CO\'eT of Pink F1oyd's "Comforubly Nwnb." 
The band turns the eerie Pink F10yd classic into 
an upbeat, falsetto drenched tune that makes you 
itch to get up and shake your groove thing. 
Other notable mentions on this debut are 
"Mary," a song which rums away from the plat-
fonn-wearing Elton John to the more serious, 
ballad-loving Elton, and "TIts on the Radio" -

gradually growing stronger; over time they trans-
form in hue and texture. building slowly to a sus-
tained zenith. Meandering lyrical lines reach full 
bloom and fall into a scampering. desolate beat. 
Then, finally, the main theme rises to the top, 
reinforced by the graceful weave of the instru-
ments below. 

With I" II Stlft Pl4ct,Jimmy LaValle may have 
had a breakthrough. The bestowal of titles is ulti-
mately meaningless - artistic accomplishments 
along the lines of this a1bwn speak enough good 
of their malcer. 

-Ian S. Port 
Hi6rw Editor 

There's not very much variety on Kiss lind 
Tell, just a bunch of two-and-three minute 
songs with slightly different progressions and 
basically the same sound. Jr's got plenty of 
energy and isn't boring in any way, but isn't 
particularly interesting, either. 
Recommended for background music at an 
obnoxious party or as a faux collection of 
Hives B-sides.

an attack on incrdsingly conservative New York 
City. 

Starting off with powerful, brash runes to 
get the night started, followed by some real 
dance-floor happy beats and winding down the 
night with the chill, mellow "Return to Oz" 
the album can be seen as a night out clubbing 
in 19705 New York. With hints of Elton John, 
Pink Floyd, Depecbe Mode and numerous 
others, the album oozes glam and camp in a 
wonderfully tasteful and fun way - something 
not enough bands do nowadays. 

Scissor Sisters will perform at Canes on Sept.

26 WELCOME WEEK SECTION THE UCSD GUARDIAN ruESDAY, SEPTEMBER ZI, ZOO4 

Long, empty road a perfect classroom for the rock uninitiated 
iPort 
on random 

Ian S. Port 

I was in the passenger seat, watch-ing the sticky midwest slide quickly and, except for the dull 
roar of our Suv, silently by. It was 
about 10 p.m., we'd just gotten back 
on the road after a stop for dinner, 
and I hadn't heard a single note of 
music in exactly nine hours and 37 
minutes. 

I was about to make a huge mis-
take. 

According to Microsoft Streetll & 
Trips, the exact distance between 
Alamo, California (your narrator's 
original home) and Crown Point, 
Indiana is 2,435 miles. We planned 
to make it in four days: leave the Bay 
Area on a Tuesday afternoon, show 
up at the grandparents' sometime 
early Friday evening. 

My copilot for the trip was to be 
my stepdad, Marco, an imposing, 
cowboy-garbed physicist who emi-
grated here from Germany about a 
decade ago. Having grown up far 
from the golden shores of American 
pop culture, Marco has one gaping, 
insidious hole in his otherwise eJld-
less body of knowledge: he knows 
nothing about rock 'n' roll. 

Somehow, despite the fact that 
I'd lived with Marco all through my 
music-rich teen years, he'd never 
really been subjected to my love in 
life - at least not in volatile doses. 
He, of course, came to the United 
States with CDs of his own. But they 
weren't good ones. 

A few days before leaving, the 
logistics of the situation startled me 

into a revelation: 2000 miles, four 
days, a wannabe rock critic and one 
(rather bltmt) culture ignoramus -
Marco was going to get an educa-
tion. 

I was determined. Not only did I 
have the oppommity (with the gor-
geous technical advances of the 40-
gigabyte iPod) to bring along hun-
dreds of the best albums rock has 
ever produced, but I actually had a 
good excuse - and a good place-
to play them. What the hell else 
were we going to do? 

The possibilities became more 
inspiring the more I doted on them. 
What ifJ cultivated a new passion in 
my musically barren father figure? 
What ifI carne home one day to find 
my stiff, unflappable stepdad rolling 
a number with Neil? Chatting up 
stray catll with Mick? Kissing the sky 
with Jimi? 

So the day we were to leave, I 
made my intentions known. I hauled 
out my laptop, iPod and the gray 
hard drive that houses most of my 
music collection, connected them 
together and tried to create a 
Begirmers Guide to Rock. 

But as I dove with ridiculous seri-
ousness into the depths of my iTunes 
library that afternoon, a nagging fear 
floated to the center of my attention. 
Would I have the balls to play what 
should be played, whether I thought 
he'd like it or not? To risk Marco 
injuring my fragile sentimentality 
with his lack of context and cold 
logic? And how was r going ·0 
explain Prince? 

That these trivialities grew to far 
outweigh reason in my mind is per-
haps best exemplified by the obvious 
and utterly timid first pick of my 
Learn to Rock Campaign: on day 
two, somewhere ' in the desen of 
Utah, I reached for the iPod and 
smugly put on Creedence 
Clearwater Revival. 

Marco nodded in approval. It was 
a hollow victory, but a beautiful 
moment. We rambled with joy in the 
afternoon light, each bend in the 
freshly-paved road revealing a crum-
bling, reddish mountainscape or 
sublime vista. The persistent snarl of 
John Fogerty and the urging 
rhythms of his band esconed us for 
more than an hour through the 
empty desert, and somehow, we 
made it through Utah. 

But as far as the Campaign was 
concerned, no progress had been 

" Would I have the balls to play 
what should be 

played ... ?" 
made. Creedence was an easy pick 
because I knew Marco'd heard it 
before, and I knew he'd lilce it. Later 
that night, as we entered Colorado, 
the doubtll I brought from Californi~ 
were still looming in my mind. 

Now, a curious thing starts to 
happen when a person who's used to 
listening to lots of music at all times 
goes for three days without hearing 
more than an hour's worth of 
Creedence. 

They stan to go insane. 
It's really a kind of withdrawal: 

clips of songs - haunting Elliot 
Smith harmonies, brutal Pixies' gui-
tar riffs and sly MickJagger refrains 
- careen involuntarily through the 
cerebral cortex, fuse themselves with 
now-painful memories of carefree 
music listening and meld into an 
instant, ferocious yearning to hear 
sumetbing, to give one's ears any 
respite from th~ inescapable drone 

of empty landscape hunling by at 80 
mph. 

So as we climbed out of the Great 
Basin through the majestic canyons 
of the western Rocky Mountains, my 
reluctance caved under the weight of 
no-music desperation. Fear, doubt 
and remorse were invisible to me as 
I scrolled hurriedly through the 
memory hanks of my digital savior. I 
needed instant satisfaction. 

A chance comment about hip-
hop set off an attempt by yours truly 
to spread appreciation of the genre 
into the older generation. I put on 
thirty seconds of the Roots before . 
deciding it wasn't hip-hop enough, 
but the look on Marco's &ce said that 
it definitely was. 

I forced myself to stop scrolling 
when I got to the Police, whom I 
thought Marco would recognize. 

"This is Sting?" he said flatly. "I 
never knew Sting sounded like tbis." 
He didn't make it sourtd like a happy 
discovery. 

After forty minutes of stopping 
and starting and skipping and stop-
ping and starting again, I gave up. I 
couldn't enjoy anything when I knew 
that my stepdad might be grittin!; his 
teeth - the very idea of enjoyment 
seemed as far away as our destina-
tion. 

I drove in &i1ure upward forever 
through the Rockies, reached the 
top at 11 ,000 feet and came rushing 
down Interstate 70 through Denver, 
heading straight for Kansas. The 
humidity and temperature both 
climbed sharply as the afternoon 
wore on. Our minds pondered in 
quiet horror the humongous dis-
tance between where we were and 
and the place where we'd planned to 
stop for the ni ght. 

Dinner carne late, and went 
quicJdy. We wolfed down a cheap 
steak at about 9:30 p.m, still a good 
two or three hours away from sleep, 

and quickly got back on the road. 
Wrapped in an envelope of inky, 
hwnid blackness, we sped down the 
interstate as fast as we could, light-
ning bolts startling the peaceful 
night awake all around us. 

When, suddenly, my withdrawal 
symptoms came screaming back to 
life. The empty electric night could 
not be left alone - it needed a 
soundtrack, and a fucking good one 
at that. 

My first pick - a careless, impul-
sive choice - was nothing less than 
a complete failure. I'd been longing 
to hear the Postal Service since 
Nevada, but "Give Up" sounded like 
a bag of marbles falling on a tile floor 
as it played through our noisy, wind-
battered four-runner. Marco tensed 
in the driver's seat. This was clearly 
not his style, and, at that moment I 
understood why. The relentlessness 
of the thunderstonn and the endless, 
sweaty drive necessitated something 
more immediate, more encompass-
ing - the right pick would enchant 
our whole evening, ease the burden 
of our journey and, I hoped, make 
Marco a rock 'n' roU fan forever. 

It was Jaclcson Browne's Utt for 
the SIty. 

"What is this?" he asked, seem-
ingly in disbelief, when "Fountain of 
Sorrow" carne on. "This is actually 
something I would go out and buy!" 

I grilUled, beaming with satisfac-
tion. Those were the words I'd been 
waiting for. 

Marco continued to gush as 
Browne's 1974 masterpiece unfolded 
song after song, late into the night 
After a thousand miles, my efforts -
despite inane fear and constant blun-
ders - somehow succeeded. Marco

A.S. coalition to rock vote 
By HANS FELLMANN 

Features Editor 

Getting students to vote can seem 
like pulling teeth. Often they feel 
they are too uninformed ro make an 
intelligent decision about which can-
didate they prefer, or they simply 
don't care who takes the presidency. 
This results in a huge loss of poten-
tial VOles - votes that could very 
well tip the balance of an election. 

To remedy this situation at 
UCSD, Associated Students has 
fonned an internal coalition with 
Chancellor Marye AlIne Fox, 
Senior Vice Chancellor David 
Miller and Vice Chancellor Joseph 
W. Watson, ResLife, Parking and 
Transportation Services, UCSD 
Libraries and several student orga-
niutions on campus to hold voting 
campaigns designed to increase stu-
dent voter turnout. 

The coalition includes California 
Public Interest Research Group, the 
Pan hellenic Council and the 
Interfraternity Council, the Green 
Party, the Graduate Student 
Association and others. 

"This coalition brings people 
together and consolidates their 
forces so there is no effort duplica-
tion,· A.S. Vice Pesident External 
Rigo Marquez said. "This year's 
presidential candidates are neck and 
neck, so student votes will playa very 
important role in deciding the elec-
tion." 

UCSD is not alone in its efforts 
to rally students to vote in the com-
ing election. At the county level, 
UCSD fo~ an enernal coalition 
with SDSU, the University of San 
Diego, Miramar College, Mesa 
College and Cal State San Marcos to 
gather votes at each campus. The 
office of California's secretary of 
state and Rock the Vote San Diego 
are also working and meeting with

larger events. 
At the state level, UCSD joins the 

. 'University of California Students 
Association, along with all other UC 
campuses in hopes of encouraging 
student voting statewide and pooling 
resources and information. 

"Each campus has already con-

to come and spealc," A.S. President 
lenn Pae said. "There is even a 
rumor that John Kerry will be com-
ing to our campus, UCSD, in 
October." 

As an extra incentive, a large sum 
of money will be awarded to the 
campus g2thering the most votes on 
Nov.2. 

"To win this competition, the on-
campus effon to collect votes and get 
students to register is going to be 
huge this year," Pae said. 

Fox, Miller and Watson have 
been reporting all infonnation to 
the University of California Office 
of the President, and ResLife has 
been slipping voter registration 
cards into moving packets to 
encourage voting. In addition, 
UCSD Libraries has created its 
own campaign, putting up posters

day out of Blitz Week for voter reg-
istration, but UCSD will be using 
the entire week. 

Week one was the week of choice 
for a number of reasons. First, this 
will be the week of FallFest, which 
always brings a huge turnout. 

"Students will be out and about 
on campus, and it will be a perfect 
time to get their attention to register 
to vote," Pae said. 

Second, students won't be inun-
dated with homework and assign-
ments so they'll be willing to check 
out what's going on around campus. 

Associated Students, the primary 
student organization involved in the 
coalition, will target five different 
groups on campus and ask them to 
encourage student voting within 
their ranks. 

These five groups are the college 
councils, the Greeks, student gov-
ernment, the Student Affirmative 
Action Committee and political 
organizations. 

Each are being asked by 
Associated Students to make presen-
tations to their respective members 
informing them about the impor-
tance of student voting and the 
events scheduled during Blitz Week. 
The groups are also being encour-
aged to hold voting booths of their 
own during Blitz Week in an attempt 
to register IDOre voten. Associated 
Students also encourages students to 
sign in on its Web site, 
http://.,.uaIl.ttlw, after they've resis-
fered to add to the campus tally. 

Marquez stated that even though 
Associated Students is the leader of 
the coalition at UCSD, it isn't trying 
to be totally in charge. 

"We simply have the resources, 
connections, information and 
finances to do it," he said. ·We still 
need and want everyone's input and 
help with this one, and we don't want 
to devalue anyone's efforts. We are 
just the organizers of the coalition 
and its finances."· . 

The total finances needed to run 
this coalition and produce the desir-
able voter turnout at UCSD will be 
around 59,900. This figure includes 
the money needed for all supplies, 
publicity, copies, t-shirts and drives 
at other colleges. A moderate esti-
mate of about $8,000 in funding is 
expected to be received from the 
Office of Student Affairs and other 
student offices. 

The goal of the A.S. and UCSA 
coalition is to register 3,500 to 4,500 
new voten at UCSD and 25,000 new 
voters statewide. Last year they were 
able to register 6,000 voters on the 
UCSD campus alone, while another 
6,000 registered at UC Berkeley. 

According to a national statistic, 
for every two people that register, one 
penon votes, meaning that a reason-
able goal for UCSD would be to bring 
in 2,000 votes total. To reach this goal 
and produce a higher VOler tumour, 
Associated Students will work around 
the clock to educate, ~r aod ~ 
more students to vote this year. This 
will not be an easy task, but the A.S. 
coalitil)n is up to it. 

Doing so could be the deciding 
factor in a deadlocked race for pres-
ident. Only 500 YOtes sepuated 
GeorJe W. Bush and AI Gore ill the 
2000 presidential election. If Ita-
deDa speak up WI year IJId 1CtUl-

Opportunities abound 

at the Guardian 
Iy CLAYTON .aFOUl 

Editor in Chief 

Let's face it: If you can't find an 
extracurricular activity to lively up 
these last few days of San Diego 
summer, you should probably check 
your pulse. For those reading this 
in the throws of Welcome Week -
before books and boredom begin to 
replace beach and booze - that 
goes doubly. And for those of you 
picking up this paper en route 
between dorm and dining hall, 
modeling unscuffed Rainbows with 
new roommates in tow, these next 
few weeks might be the most active 
of your life; socially, politicaUy, cul-
turally, sexually - you name it. 

Indeed, for fifth-year seniors 
and 12-unit freshmen alike, this 
September renaissance of new 
opportunity and 70-degree ocean 
water is to be cherished, because, 
like that multiculturalism class you 
need to take before you graduate, 
it's not offered year-round at 
UCSD. 

And that's exactly where we at 
the GlUlTdill" would like to fit in. Be 
it an on-campus job, a student orga-
nization, a sports team or a Greek 
chapter, you'll want something to 
get you through the post-summer 
doldrums to come, when the weath-
er turns, your roommate goes nuts, 
and you realiie the only thing of 
any worth within walking distance 
from campus is a beach that's cool 
for surfers, nudists and uphill-walk-
ing enthusiasts - but few others. 

Yes, it's true; To make the most 
of your days spent at a commuter 

campus snuggled amid mansions, 
strip malls and apartment complex-
es, you better get involved (fast!), 
and there are few better or more 
all-encompassing ways to do so 
than joining the GlUlf'dil",. Our edi-
tors and staff like politics, music, 
sport, literature and beer - and, 
what's more, we're hiring students 
of all commitment levels to join us 
this year in these pursuits. 

Published twice weekly, the 
GlUmJin is an independent, stu-
dent-run newspaper that enjoys a 
circulation of 10,000 in and around 
UCSD. Opponunities abound in 
each of our five sections - news, 
opinion, features, hiatus and sports 
- as well IS in our photography, 
graphics, design and copy depart-
ments. 

In other words, there are posi-
tions open for a wide variety of stu-
dents. Some might think of the 
GJUn'din as a liberal arts balance to 
that science degree. Others might 
see it as a way to stay fluent on cur-
rent issues, campus-, state- and 
nationwide. Most, however, myself 
very much included, see the 
'GlUlrdilm as an opportunity to per-
form an important service for the 
university community, hone some 
real world experience in the fields 
of journalism', politics and profes-
sionalism, and interact with some 
very cool people during those 

. months, quarters, yean spent at our 
often socially awkward school. 

In many ways, tbe culture, poli-
tics, and administrative decisions

Physician delves into the 
tnind of a serial killer 

'Body Double' author interviewed 
ByUSAMAK 

Senior Staff Writer 

Not many physicians leave their 
pnctice behind to become Nt'W York 
Times best-selling medical thriller 
authors. 

Since the release of "Harvest" in 
1996. Tess Gerritsen has hooked 
readers with her unpredictable plot 
twists. grisly medical descriptions, 
and pulse-pounding prose. 
Gerritsen's latest book, "Body 
Double." features Boston medical 
examiner Maura Isles, who discovers 
that a homicide victim is her exact 
identical twin . 

While on tour in San Diego, 
Gerritsen discussed her newest work 
and her experiences as a writer. 

GtumIitzrt: Where did you get the 
idea for "Body Double"? 

Tess Genitsen: I always try to 
find a premise that gives me a chill. 
In this case, the chill occurred to me 
while I was standing in the autopsy 
room. 

I am a doctor and I have seen a 
number of gruesome autopsies 
throughout my years of training, but. 
I thought it was time to go back into 
the autopsy room and make sure I 
remembered everything that I had 
learned correctly. 

So I called up the medical exam-
iner in Maine, and I asked her if it 
was OK to observe her doing (an 
autopsy) ... So I'm standing there' 
watching this entire autopsy and just 
thinking, "This is terrible. What if 
this was someone I knew? Is there 
anything worse than watching an 
autopsy on someone you know?"'" And 

AacIIeI A. r:.o.;Guardion 
Author interliew: Tess Gerritsen speaks about her new book. "Body Double: in 
which she explores topics such as inherent evil and murderous families. 
then I thought, "What if you could 
somehow watch an autopsy on your-
self? 

G: What kind of research did you 
have to do for your newest book? 

T: I thought I would [also) 
ezplore the. issue of identity and the 
issue of whether evil is hereditary or 
not, and what it would feel like to 
know that you're descended from 
monsters. 

As pan of my research, I thought, 
"You know what? I need to find out 
how often this happens -how many 
families who kill are there through 
history?" And 1 found a couple of 

really chilling examples ." I wanted 
to play with this idea of families who 
slay together. 

G: How is "Body Double" similar 
to and differen t from your previous 
work? 

T : It's similar in that 1 cover a lot 
of the same themes and I deal with 
the same characters, and I have a lot 
of the same forensic stuff that I think 
people are very fascinated by. I think 
what's different about it is that, more 
than any other book, I really did not 
know where it was going. That book

Good sex comes from knowing 
what you want from it 

Sex column to promote sexual 
exploration,. awareness, advice 

The Sex 
Guardian 

Ullian NecIwick 

W elcomel Step up, snuggle down and make yourself comfortable with the first edi-tion of "The Sex Guardian." I am your 
host, a fellow student who has often found her-
self wandering the ridiculously confusing but 
wonderful halls of sexual pleasure. To ease the 
tension a little bit, and make you feel more at 
home, I'll begin with a story as 

" 

column is advice, which I will readily find and 
hand out. But before I can hope to help anyone 
with any seIUal advice, good or otherwise, I ask 
you to consider what I think to be one of the 
most important aspects of sex: awareness. 
Awareness of what you consider to be sex, 
awareness of your chosen expressions of it, who 
you want it from, and most importantly, what 
you want out of it. 

Do you live to please, to be pleased or both? 
Do you want to have ropious amounts of sex, or 
keep the penetration to a minimwn? Are you one 
for rough, sweaty sex, softer loving sex, a quick 
romp in the morning, or a three-bour-Iong 
excursion into the night? All of these "types" of 
sexuality have their place for a sexually active per-

son; they're all ridiculous 
amounts of fun when you are 
actually enjoying iL 

an introduction to a year of 
questions and answers, really 
touchy subjectS and hopefully, 
advice. 

My best friend, Fuzzo, had 
never celebrated Valentine's 
Day before 2004. She and her 
previous boyfriend never real-
ly did the whole Hallmarlc. 
"go-prove-you-Iove-her" day. 
And although the dinner and 
gift that her current 
boyfriend, Shmee, had pre-

It's high time to 
address that 

Too many times, people 
rush into sex not realizing the 
entirety of the experience and 
how much fun it really can be, 
and how much of themselves 
they can really throw into it . curiosity, expose 

and explore it, and 
talk about sex!" 

Everything - from a gen-
tle kiss to full-blown, scream-
ing intercourse - is sexual, 
and you can express yourself in 

pared for her still tasted of the 
consumerist holiday, the evening was really 
fun . All elements were accounted for: a loving 
couple, a good dinner, some hysterical con-
versation, an attempted cleaning effort and 
endless provocative flirting. 

Eventually, the pair made their way into the 
waiting empty bedroom and got it on. And the 
getting was good. Wonderful, actually. 
Neverrnind that Shmee's loolc.s might vaguely 

.. remind you of a thin troll, and that the bed was 
small - twin sired. The house was empty for 
once, and ShnlCe's sexual ability combined with 
Fuzzo's eagerness more than made up for what-
ever lack of space there was. 

Both persons were taking their time with 
one another, endlessly tcasing, slowly peeling 
off bothersome articles of clothing, until they 
were fully naked and sCJIing. As they got into 
it, a moan of pleasure escaped Shmee's lips in 
the form of a loud whisper: "Mmm . .. 
Fuzzo .. . " 

And, my friend, being the sweet, caring per-
son that she is, stopped, looked up at Shmee, 
and with a concerned look on her face and an 
incredulous tone, responded with a confused, 
"What'" 

Needless to say, it kind of ruined the mood 
for both partners. 

Here, we have a classic (and completely 
true) story of the ups and downs of sex, a night 
complete with love, fun and a laughable, stupid 
mistalc.e. 

Some of us have been there, others of us 
haven't. Regardless of personal experience, 
though, a curiosity about all things sexual has 
probably crossed at least most of the minds of 
the people idling their hours away on campus. 
I t's high time to address that curiosity, expose 
and explore it, and talk about sex. 

The first thing you may associate with a sex 

simple movements. 
The more aware you are 

of little things - the sensitivity of fingers 
lightly touching someone's jawline, the places 
00 the body that are generally ignored (lilc.e 
the baclc. of the legs or ankles), or the way the 
lip curls on the mouth of someone who knows 
he or she is giving insane pleasure to their 
partner - tbe better. It's all something that 
needs to be taken into consideration as a per-
son becomes aware of their own sensuality. 
The more aware you become of it, the more 
fun you can have with it. 

Sex, as defIDed by Merriam-Webster's 
online dictionary, is "sexually motivated phe-
nomena or behavior." I think it's a fantastic def-
inition . Sex is a phenomenon. Its a phenome-
non of instincts, love, honnones, adrenaline, 
alcohol, fun, anger, desperation, learning and 
many more elements. It can be a glorious expe-
rience, an embarrassing one, a frightening one, 
and sometimes, even a terrible one. Of course, 
the outcome depends almost entirely on what 
you malc.e of the experience and what you want 
from it. 

This column will address sexuality from all 
of these angles, and hopefully put it into per-
spective for the horny college student - Its 
goal is to serve as a communicator of sorts. I 
will discuss sexual topics in the "real world," 
answer questions and do researc~ for readers, 
and most importantly, give out sex advice for 
all. 

Yes, this will be a tips and triclcs page, but 
hopefully one that doesn't just tell you what to 
do but instead begs you to talc.e it all, personal-
ize it, and express )'QUI sexuality in your own 
amazing way.

aspiring 
authors 

Radle! A. Glra./GcJordian 
Spe.kin •• Ioud: Tess Gerritsen tells 
a full crowd about the inspirations for 
her new fIVe-part book series. 

continUed fram page 3 I 
was really like I was writing blind, 
and I was very surprised by the end-
ing. 

G: Your earlier work consisted of 
a series of romantic thrillers. What 
influenced you to shift to writing 
medical thrillers, the first of which 
was "Harvest"? 

T: I never intended to write a 
medical thriller; I was happy 
writing romantic novels. But I 
had dinner with this homicide 
cop who told me he had been 
traveling in Russia and he heard 
from another cop that orphans 
were vanishing and he was con -
vinced those kids were being 
sent to the Middle East as organ 
donors. 

That's sort of how "Harvest" got 
launched, and I just knew I wanted to 
do something on organ transplanta-
tion. 

G: Something that you've been 
known for is your ability to get into 
the minds' of your characters, even 
your villains. When you're writing, 
how do you do this so well? 

T . I think you have to be some-
thing of an actor. I did acting when I 
was in high school, and I've always 
sort of been able to get myself into 
character. What you really need to do 
is just put yourself in their world and 
try and think the way they would 
think, and suddenly the words come 
to you • . 

G: There are many authors like 
yourself who use their medical back-
grounds in their work. Why do you 
think someone with medical training 
would be d~wn to writing fictional 
novels? 

T: I think it's ~cause of the 
drama that they see as part qf their 
job. There aren't too many jobs that 
introduce you to humans in such bad 
'straits and such good straits, except 
for policemen. I think that cops and 
docs have a similar insight into pe0-
ple in crisis, so I think they have a lot 
of material. . 

G: You said you're working on the 
fiM book in the series. How~ that 
coming along? 

T: I don't have a title for it yet, 
but again it was [based] on a true 
story. A young woman [was] found 
'dead in a bathtub in the suburbs on 
the outskirts of Boston ... The fire 
department came in, found her, and 
it looked like a drug overdose. 

So they bagged her up in. a body 
bag and sent her to the morgue, 
where a couple hours later she woke 
up. So I thought, "This is an interest-
ing beginning to a book." And I also 
wanted, to find out how often it hap-
pens, and it turns out it happens quite 
often. 

G: What advice do you have for 
younger a1iring authors? 

T: Rea everything you can. You 
cannot be a writer if you don't read 
... trying to write without being a 
reader is Ijke trying to be a musician 

~nthout ever listening to music. It's 
virtually impossible. You can't do it. 
Read across the board. Every book 
has • purpose in your educatio,. 
wether it be factual or styllistic or 
simply to get ideas.

Soapbox: 
Guardian 

offers diverse 
outlets 

continued from page :19 
that make news in the UCSD com-
munity are simply microcosms of 
those found at a city, state or 
national level. Often these news 
items coincide. as with city council 
decisions, state budgetary issues and 
ballot propositions that affect cam-
pus life. 

Our news section features cam-
pus-, UC-, San Diego-area-, and 
other types of news of interest to the 
UCSD community. Working 
throughout the week, news writers 
conduct interviews, attend events, 
analyze reports and perform research 
on a wide array of topics. Student 
government, campus events, admin-
istration, and campus trends are fre-
quent topics of coverage for the sec-
tion. 

The opinion section will serve 
this year to reflect the range of cam-
pus sentiment regarding topica l 
issues, often those reported on in 
our news section. The staff meets 
regularly to discuss and debate top-
ics at the forefront of campus dis-
course, and the section often fea-
tures pro/con arguments on a given 
subject, in addition to standalone 
pieces, letters to the editor and edi-
torials. 

Features is easily the most 
diverse of the sections, with articles 
ranging from book reviews to sex 
columns to io-depth news reports. 
Published on Mondays, fea tures 
strives to produce content of inter- .' 
est to you, the college student or 
UCSD community member. 

Hiatus is our Thursday arts and 
entertainment section, featuring 
reviews of the latest college music 
and film, and previews of area con-
certs, theater and other events (aside 
from being the best place to score 
free CDs). 

Finally, the sports section is the 
place to rurn for game summaries, 
profiles and interviews of UCSD 's 
teams - NCAA and club alike - as 
well as other San Diego-area sport-
ing events. 

The GUllrdian S deparonents are 
charged with enhancing the paper's 
written content, and photogra-
phers. illustrators, designers and 
copy readers work hand-in-hand 
with writers and section editors to 
do so. 

Photographers shoot a wide 
range of subject matter, with assign-
ments ranging from rallies to water 
polo games. 

Illustrators are also assigned an 
array of projects, often for the opin-
ion and features section, and pro-
vide artistic portrayals of people, 
events and ideas. In addition, sub-
missions are gladly accepted for the 
news and opinion sections' weekly 
comics. 

Designers use Quark software as 
they worle with editors in the pro-
duction-room trenches to piece 
together the photos, illustrations, 
stories and design elements that 
compose each section. 

Lastly, but quite importantly, 
copy readers proofread each story 
before it is placed on the page to 
ensure proper grammar and adher-
ence to Associated Press (AP) style. 

So there you have it, the makings 
of the G,uIf'IJill1l - and the makings 
of a stellar extracurricular activity at 
UCSD, if any of the above suites 
you. 

Our staff will be on Library 
Walk this week answering ques-
tions, so stop by for any and all 
information. We will also be host-
ing I recruitment meeting this 
Friday, September 24 at 5 p.m. out-
side our office on the second floor 
of Student Center. And as always, 
feel free to contact me at: 
tJitdtlatlgunJin.vrg. 

Otherwise, enjoy that Welcome 
Week while it I.su, and we'll see 
you on the stands .

Women 's cross country is com-
ing off of a strong 2003 season that 
was packed with team accomplish-
ments through the Nov. 22 NCAA 
Division II Championships, in 
which the Tritons finished 16th in 
a field of 24 teams. In the weeks 
leading up to the national champi-
onship, however, VCSD pounded 
on conference competition at the 
Triton Classic, finishing the day in 
first place out of six entered teams, 
then taking second in a field of 10 
teams at the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association 
C hampionships to hos t Chico 
State. T he high point of the 
UCSD women 's cross country 
postseason came at the N CAA 
Division II West Regional race, 
where the Tritons va nquished their 
opponents by de feating 22 other 
tea ms to take second place behind 
Chico. 

T he 2004 roster, with 22 mem-
bers, is equipped with only two 
seniors - Lindsay Stalker and 
Lindsey Young - meaning that 
the T ritons will be looking to their 
10 freshmen runners to step up and 
provide a solid foundation for their 
veteran teammates. 

Head coach Ted Van Arsdale will 
be guiding both the men's and 
women 's cross country programs for 
UCSD for hi s 13th consecutive 
year. Since the Tritons made the 
transition from Division TIl to

New players lead No. 12 UCSD 
Seniors red shirt in preparation for next year 

By MATTHEW GIANT 
Sports Editor 

Men's water polo promises 
another exciting season as head 
coach Denny Harper returns to the 
deck of Canyonview Pool for his 
24th season leading UCSD. Last 
year's team posted a 19-10-0 record 
that carried it to a frustrating 6-5 
loss in the final game of the 
Western Water Polo Association 
Championship against rival Loyola 
Marymount University. 

Harper, whose knowledge of 
the sport is emphasized by his 
409-317-4 career record, has 
guided the Tritons to the NCAA 
Final Four in nine of the past 12 
seasons, including UCSD's first-
ever Division II team berth in the 
final match of the tournament in 
2000, following a 9-8 upset over 
No. 2 USC in the semifinals. 
Harper has earned the undeniable 
respect of players and coaches 
around the league with his recep-
tion of the WWPA Coach of the 
Year honor on 14 occasions. 

The 2004 season should be 
brimming with surprises from this 
young team. Although last year's 
squad only saw two seniors gradu-
ate, seven of the most influential 
players from that group opted to 
red shirt this year in favor of saving 
their last year of NCAA eligibility 
for next season, when several of the 
team's younger players will have 
had the opportunity to develop 
over this season, giving the Tritons 
a better shot at the NCAA 
Championship. 

Seniors Kevin Smoker, Brandon 
Borso, Jonathan Hopkins, Clark 
Petersen, Travis Boettner, Steven 
Jendrusina and junior goalie 
Jeremy Randall will practice with 
the team but will not compete until 
the 2005 season. Hopkins was 
named the 2004 WWPA Most 
Valuable Player and was named to 
the First Team A11-WWPA squad 
with Borsa, while Petersen and 
junior goalie Colin McElroy 
earned Second-Team A11-WWPA 
honors . 

Each of last season's six red 
shirt athletes have been activated, 
as have two additional freshman 
players, so the depth of the Triton 
squad has not been compromised 
by this season's unorthodox 
reconfiguration . However, the 
team will be seeking new leader-
ship from the upperclassmen who 
remain in action for this season, 
including the one eligible senior,

Men's soccer starts undefeated 
Tritons kick off season with a 3-0-1 record 

By MATTHEW GIANI' 
Sports Editor 

Men's soccer is working to 
improve on the success of its ZOO3 
season, in which the squad earned a 
10-5 overall record heading into 
the postseason. A victory over Cal 
State Dominguez Hills in the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association Semifinal match landed 
the Tritons a berth in the confer-
ence Finals match against Chico 
State. which defeated UCSD in 
regular season play, 3-1 on Oct. 3. 

The Tritons were unable to 
mount an upset victory and feU to 
the Wildcats in a discouraging 5-1 
game. StiU, the hopes of UCSD 
players were not entirely van-
quished; the Tritons were given a 
final opponunity to rebound from 
their loss in the first round of the 
NCAA tournament, where the 
squad was set to face off against 
Chico State in the single elimination 
tournament. The dire circumstances 
were overwhelming for UCSD, 
which held off the Wildcats for the 
first 83 minutes and 27 seconds, and 
even appeared to have the upper 
hand through the early minutes of 
the second half. But those final seven 
minutes were too much for the 
Triton team, and two goals were 
scored on UCSD before the 90-
minute game clock expired. 

In his 22nd season as head coach 
for the Tritons men's soccer pro-
gram, Derek Armstrong has 
mounted numerous successes at 
both the Division III level and 
more recently in Division n com-
petition. In IS invitations to the 
Division ill national tournament, 
Armstrong led UCSD to three 
national tides. Now, after only 
three trips to the CCAA tourna-
ment. the Tritons advanced to the 
final match for the first time since 
the 2000 jump to Division n. then 
were selected for the NCAA tour-
nament. The team is accelerating

Women's volleyball aims for title 
Tritons are on a four-match win streak 

By MAntlEW GRANT 
Sports Editor 

Women's volleyball is looking 
to bounce back into form after 
suffering a discouraging upset to 
Hawaii Pacific in the 2003 NCAA 
Division II Women's Volleyball 
Championship Pacific Regional 
Semifinal, which snapped a 20-
match winning streak for the 
Tritons, and ended the team's sea-
son. 

Ninth-year head coach 
Duncan McFarland led the 2003 
squad to an overall 25-5 mark in 
2003, including a 19-3 California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
record. which was strong enough 
to earn UCSD the No.1 national 
ranking going into the postseason. 

In 2001, after finishing the sea-
son with a mark of 25-7 and 
reaching the NCAA Semifinals, 
McFarland was named the NCAA 
Division II National Coach of the 
Year. In 1997, before UCSD made 
the transition to Division II, 
McFarland led the Tritons to the 
NCAA Division III National 
Championship and was named the 
NCAA Di vision III National 
Coach of the Year. Prior to the 
2004 campaign, McFarland had 
built up a 201-47 overall record-
an .BII wilming percentage. 

The Tritons, who competed in 
the 2003 season with only 10 var-
sity athletes, have practically dou-
bled the size of the team's roster 
by not graduating any seniors and 
acquiring six new players, includ-
ing four eligible freshmen. UCSD 
will be looking to veteran senior 
stars, including 2003 All-CCAA 
First Team members Kendra 
Canape, Bonnie Wilson and

UCSD looks to 
run at Nationals 
Men's cross country places 
first, second in two meets 

By MAlTHEW GIANT 
Sports Editor 

The Tritons men's cross country 
program will be seeking to build on 
the team's successes of recent sea-
sons since moving to Division II, 
including trips to the NCAA 
National Championships in 2001 
and in 2003, both of which merited 
15th-place finishes for the team. 

In 2003, the Tritons' strengths 
were visible throughout the season 
as the squad finished all but two of 
its races in the top half of the field 
and recorded six top-three finishes. 

In a narrow, five-team competi-
tion for the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association 
Championship, UCSD was defeat-
ed by defending champion Chico 
State and was edged out by Cal 
Poly Pomona to talee third place at 
the event. Senior Neil Kalra, who 
was ranked second regionally and 
seventh nationally for the race, fin-
ished fourth in a field of 43 to earn 
All-CCAA honors for his second 
consecutive year. Junior Robert 
Eap completed the B,OOO-meter 
course 11 th overall , which also 
merited All-CCAA honors. The 
first seven Tritons to cross the fin-
ish line at the 2003 CCAA 
Championships were all in the top 
20 overall. Freshman Steve Vargas 
crossed the line in 23rd place for 
UCSD, garnering CCAA 
Freshman of the Year honors. 

The 2003 NCAA Division II 

West Regionals meet gave the 
Triton men a chance to improve on 
the performance at the conference 
championship and to open the door 
to the NCAA Division II National 
Championship. Determined, the 
Tritons pulled together for an out-
standing second-place team finish 
in the 17 -team field. 

The 2004 season will undoubt-
edly offer the Tritons a greater 
challenge than they were faced with 
in 2003 if they expect to improve. 
Seven of the 16 runners on the 
2003 squad were graduating 
seniors, and that void has hardly 
been filled by this years numbers. 
The 2004 squad is equipped with 
only three seniors and five juniors; 
if 2004 is going to be a successful 
year for the mer.'s cross coun try 
team, then head coach Ted Van 
ArsdaJe will be expecting big per-
formances of his freshman class, 
which, at eight runners, comprises 
half of the team's roster. 

Already out to a fast start, the 
Tritons brought home a second-
place finish at the UC Irvine 
Invitational on Sept. II in a field of 
12 tearns. Eap was the top finisher 
for UCSD, crossing the finish line 
in 25 minutes, 51.9 seconds for a 
sixth-place finish only 30 seconds 
behind meet winner Jim Grabow of 
Long Beach State. 

The next chance to see the 
men's cross country team in action 
will be Oct. 9 at the UCSD Triton 
Classic.

110 UC athletes 
compete in Athens 

Fonner Triton Alex 
Cremidan throws a no-hitter 

By MATTHEW GIANT 
Sports Editor 

Imagine that you are once 
again watching the opening cere-
monies of the 2004 Summer 
Olympic Games - athletes 
dressed to match as they boast 
their country's flag, wave to fans . 
and smile for the myriad of cam-
eras flashing at them. Moments 
after the mob of American com-
petitors files onto the track at 
Olympic Stadium, another excep-
tionally large contingent marches 
out beneath a banner that reads, 
"University of California ." 
Although it may sound absurd, it's 
not as far-fetched as one might 
think. 

One hun-
dred and ten 
athletes with 
UC connec-
tions traveled to 
Athens, Greece, 
in order to 
demonstrate 
their kinesthet-
ic prowess 
against the 
world 's best, 
earning )6 
medals, includ-
ing 13 gold, 10 
silver and 13 
bronze a 
medal count 

Diego, acquired her disabiliry 
from meningococcal meningitis in 
1995. She competed in her first 
Paralympic Games in Sydney, 
Australia in 2000, where she won 
the silver medal in the 20-point 
relay competition. Other croWD-
ing achievements going into the 
games include first-place finishes 
at the 2004 Paralympic swimming 
trials in the 50-meter freestyle, 
SO-meter backstroke and 100-
meter freestyle events. 

The Paralympic Games are the 
most intense international athletic 
competition for individuals with 
physical disabilities. The com-
petitors at the Paralympic Games 
are year-round athletes who have 
to qualify for their events and who 

get cut from teams, 
exactly as they do 
in the Olympics. It 
is not to be con-
fused with the 
Special Olympics, 
which is for indi-
viduals with intel-
lectual disabilities. 

that would have 
made the 
University of 
California the 
seventh leading 
"country" in the 
world, behind 

Adopeecl son: Greek-American 
Alex Cremidan, a former Triton, 
played for Greece in Athens. 

Tw e nty - two -
year-old UC 
Berkeley alumna 
Natalie Coughlin 
was the individual 
UC medal leader 
with her two gold-
medal showings in 
the 100-meter 
baclcstroke and 
BOO-meter freestyle 
relay events, two 
silver medals in the 
400 - metcr 
frees tyle relay and 
the 400-meter 

only the United States, Russia , 
China, Australia, Germany and 
Japan. 

UCSD has been home to three 
athletes, including 20-year-old 
current UCSD student Carrie 
Johnson, who raced in the K-I 
and K-4 Oatwater sprint canoe 
kayak events, former Triton star 
pitcher Alex Cremidan, who rep-
resented host country Greece on 
the baseball diamond, and 
Melanie Benn, a quadruple 
amputee_ Sbe will swim in the 
freestyle and backstroke events at 
the Paralympic Games, which 
takes place between Sept. 19 and 
Sept_ 27 in Athens. 

Jobnson's Olympic bid was 
marked by her April 1 5 qualifying 
race on Lake Merritt in Oakland, 
Calif., where she charged past for-
mer Olympians Kathy Colin and 
Ruth Nortje in the K-I S()()-meter 
race to snatch her place in the 
Summer Games. Johnson shocked 
onlookers, who were largely con-
sumed with the battle between 
Cplin and Nonje, by passing the 
race favorites and crossing the fin-
ish line nearly two full seconds 
ahead of second-place finisher 
Colin and three seconds ahead of 
internationally fourth-ranked 
Nortje. Johnson went on to finish 
the K-l SOO-meter race in 12th 
overall in Athens. 

Cremidan, a 23-year-old grad-
uate of Thurgood Marshall 
College, plays for the South Bend 
Silver Hawks, a Single-A farm 
team of the Arizona 
Diamondbacks. In 2002, while 
pitching for the Greek national 
team in an Olympic qualifying 
game, Cremidan threw a no-hitter 
in his team's 21-0 trouncing of 
Slovalcia. Greece placed seventh 
out of eight teams in the final 
Olympic standings. 

Benn, a native of Ann Arbor, 
Mich., who now resides in San 

medley relay 
events and a bronze medal in the 
lOO-meter freestyle. 

UCLA was once home to five 
of the gold medal-winning U.S. 
softball players, including 33-
year-old Lisa Fernandez, 23-year-
old Tairia Flowers, 24-year-old 
Amanda Freed, 26-year-old 
Stacey Nuveman and 22-year-old 
Natasha Watley. Fernandez won 
her third gold medal in three 
Olympic competitions and is 
regarded by many as the country's 
best softball player. 

Joy Fawcett, a 36-year-old vet-
eran of the American national 
women's soccer team and gradu-
ate of both Berkeley and UCLA, 
helped lead ber squad to the gold 
medal. 

Pete Cipollone, a 33-year-old 
UC Berkeley alumnus, belped his 
boat on to gold medal stardom in 
the men's eight rowing. 

In track and field events, 
UCLA representatives Joanna 
Hayes, 27, and Monique 
Henderson, 21, each pulled out 
gold medals. Hayes won the I ()()-
meter hurdles event while 
Henderson blazed to team victory 
in the 1600-meter relay. 

Women's beach volleyball sen-
sations Holly McPeak, 35, and 
Elaine Youngs, 34, brought home 
bronze medals in their event. 
McPeak is an alumna of UCLA 
and UC Berkeley; Youngs attend-
ed UCLA. 

The collective success of UC 
athletes is nothing unusual in 
Olympic competition, though 2004 
proved to be the most fruitful year 
for those competitors. In the 2000 
Summer Games in Sydney, 
University of California captured 
34 medals - an impressive 
achievement that was set only to be 
shattered by the athletes of 2004, 
just as the current mark of 36 could 
easily be reset in the nellt Summer 
Games in Beijing, China.
