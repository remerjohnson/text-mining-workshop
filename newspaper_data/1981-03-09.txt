18 tell the 
chancellor 
their irks 
Atkinson holds 
first open forum 
BY JONATHAN KROLL 

Staff Writer 
All Chancellor Richard 

Atkinson got were gripes, 
complaints, grievances and 
grumbles last Friday for an 
hour - but he asked for it. 

Aflter all, it was his idea to 
hold an open forum to hear 
any and all problems voiced 
by UCSD students. 

Assistant Chancellor Pat 
Ledden was also on hand. 

Eighteen students showed 
up at the North Conference 
Room in the Student Center 
from 11 am to noon to tell 
their tales of woe to the head 
man at UCSD. 

The most incensed of those 
present were five parents 
asking for help in maintain-
ing and possibly expanding 
the campus day care center. 
The parents are threatened 
with the loss of four CETA 
employees due to federal 
cutbacks in funding. 

"If day care is cut off we 
can't continue our education. 
We can't afford private day 
care," one parent, Penny 
Green, said. 

The parents have asked 
the Chancellor for $16,000 to 
replace the CET A funds from 
the federal government, 
which may be cut off under 
President Reagan's new 
economic plan. . 

The day care center 
requested supplemental 
funding from the Reg Fee 
Committee last week to 
replace federal funding. 
Their request was denied. 

Atkinson inned the 
problem on econ} .i ' S o " I can 
find money for a short period, 
but not for a long period. For 
that you need a continuous 
flow of funding. " There are 
financial problems acro s the 
country, he explained. 
"Country trends are to blame 
and I have no control over 
them."

Man \Vith a gun 
stopped at Rev. 
Threatened RA's life; 
subdued after a struggle 

BY JENIFER WARREN 
News Editor 

A man carrying a pistol was arrested at about 
6:30 la t night in the Revelle Cafeteria after twice 
threatening the life on a resident advisor there. 

He was detained after a short struggle with 
campu police in which no shot were fired. No one 
was hurt , witnesses said. 

Police refused to release any details of the 
incident. 

Chancellor Atkinson relaxes during an interview Friday with 
the Guardian. He came down hard on the AS and argued that 
Third Provost Joseph Watson is a persuasive choice for VeUA. 

Known only as "Dutch" by the threatened RA, 
who asked not to be identified, the man snuck into 
the cafeteria, got a tray of food and took a seat at a 
crowded table.

Atkinson: Watson is 
'superb' for . VC U A 
Also criticizes AS performance 

BY JEFF BERESFORD. HOWE 
News Editor 

Chancello r Atkinson 
suggested that Third Provost 
Joseph Watson would make a 
"spectacular" Vice Chancel-
lor of Undergraduate Affairs 
and gave some critical advice 
to the AS Thursday at an 
hour-and-a-half long inter-
view with two Guardian 
reJ)Orters. 

Whom a search committee 
will select is still, of course, 
uncertain, but Atkinson 
suggested that Watson, most 
prominantly mentioned 
among students and 
administrators as a likely 
choice, would do well. 

"I judge that he's very 
popular with students ... he's 
stood by issues of quality and 
taken tough stances when 
he's had to. 

"I think Joe Watson is a 
remarkable figure on this 
campus; he has established 
hims e lf throughout the 
nation as effective in 
leadership roles. He would do 
a spt:dacular job as Vice 
Chancellor of Undergraduate 
Affairs .. . 

"I could not image that if 
he were interested in the job 
he would not be a serious 
candidate for it." 

"I wouldn't want a local 
event like the Incomplete 
police case to det~ine who 

> the Vice Chancel~9r is 't he 
added_ 

Atkinson also todk time to 
talk about what even most of 
the AS sees as an ineffective 
year for the government. 

While arguing that 
students "enjoy life here a 
little more than most people 
are willing' to admit," the 
chancellor said the AS has 
failed to address important 
issues this year that could 
improve thl) quality of life. 

"The purpose of a student 
government is to participate 
in a deep n e in the 
governance of the campus. If 
that doesn't occur, wecan not 
make progress on certain 
fronts, " the chancellor aid. 

"One is the cost of hous ing 
on this campus versus other 
campuses. We tend to have a

Why must Daycare Center justify itself again? 
Editor: 

We would like to take this 
opportunity to thank a group 
of student supporters of 

Intercoll~ate Athletics for 
their . patience, understand· 
ing' and support. 

The Registration Fee 
Committee met Tuesday, 
March 3 to discuss the 

~ibility of increasing the 
UCSD Day Care Center 
budaet to cover its loss of four 
CETA employees. Intercolle-
giate Athletics' bu<laet was 
atao on the aaenda -r-uesday. 
Many students supporting IA 
crowded into the conference 
room, dwarfina the number 
cl parents who wished to 
show their support for the 
Day Care Center. Day Care's 
hearing lasted about an hour 
and a half. Throughout the 
sometimes emotional ex· 
changes in the hearing, the' 
supporters of IJ\ remained 
very patient. 

Issues regarding students' 
wishes to rontinue to support 
the Day Care Center that we 
thought were decided two 
years ago in the Day Care 

Referendum continue to be 
brought up by administra· 
tors on the Committee. The 
IA students, unlike the 
administrators, went into 

. this meeting without hidden 
agendas or outdated ideas of 
child care. After standing 
through an intensive 
education on child care needs 
in the state from UC 
ChildCare Coordinator, Sue 
Brock, these students seemed 
to understand instinctively 
the importance of continuing 
quality child care at UCSD. 
Students, also unlike the 
administrators, know how 
difficult life as a student can 
be. They seemed to 
understand quite well that 

. student parents have even 
less time than they do and 
that parents need not be 
penalized through lack of 
help. 

When asked by R~ Fee 
Chair Kathy Valerio If the 
students in the room 
supported Day Care on this 
campus, they all responded 
overwhelmingly yes. No one 
objected. Even with this 

Women in drama 
Editor: 

We are appalled at the 
limited acting opportunities 
available for undergraduate 
women spring quarter . 
Repeatedly, the drama 
depart ment has chosen to do 
productions that have few if 
any roles for women. 
Competition for these few 
roles is intense due to the 
increasing number of female 
graduate students. 

This scarcity of acting 
opportunities forces women 
undergraduate actors to 
work on shows in a technical 
capacity only. Generating 
our own projects is difficult 
for a number of reasons: 
advisors are necessary, yet 
the faculty has little time to 
give to the projects; rehearsal 
space is limited; and the 
available funds are absurd. 

We recognize the benefits 
of undergraduate projects. 
Nevertheless, there are limits 
to wha~ one undergraduate 
can give to another. We need 
more opportunity to learn 
from our faculty . This 
inequity is one that the 
drama faculty must correct 
- we cannot. Without this 
"'tariety of opportunities the 
drama department cannot 
hope to attract promising 
young students and keep 
them here.

Be green 
Editor: 

The children of Atlanta are 
dying. I am not referring to 
the 20 who have been laid to 
rest forever, but the 
thousands of children who 
must face another day of 
questioning whether they 
will see their home again, 
whether they will become a 
statistic of the brutal murder 
wave. 

You may say this is an 
isolated incident, but it could 
happen in any city in the 
USA. Some of you may say, "I 
don't care because all the 
dead are Black"; I say to you 
they were children, with the 
rest of their lives ahead of 
them. In another city or time 
they could be White, yellow 
or trown. 

Some of you care but don't 
know what you can do. Wear 
a green ribbon shaped in an 
inverted "V" over your heart. 
The green is to SIgnify that 
you believe all life is sacred 
and should be protected. 
When the murderer is 
apprehended and the 
nightmare over, the ribbon 
will be turned right side up 
sign ifying "victory." 

There may still be 
questions about "why." Just 
look in any child's face and 
you'll have your answer.

Some just have more drive 
BY JOHN HONDROS 

I ~ess I should think twice before 
cheWln~ out my car for being the expense 
that it IS. Although it eats up what little 
money I get from m1 Guardian paycheck, I 
don't know where I d be without my Bug. 

I remember how cool I felt when my father 
gave me the "privilege" of driving "his" car 
to high school during my senior year (of 
couse, it was "my" car as far as my friends 
and I were concerned). It meant not having 
to sit three·tOoa·seat on those rough·riding 
yellow monsters that were oh, so cruel on 
my vitals. 

Every time I see a student thumbing on 
Torrey Pines Road, I realize how I've taken 
for granted the control I have over my own 
mobility (that is, when my car is not on the 
blink). I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't 
escape temporarily for ; let's say, a cup of 
frozen yogurt, or a cruise down to La Jolla 
Shores. 

Neitherofmy grandmothers (or, as I know 
them, my yiayias) have had It t h is easy. 
Back in the Old Country (Greece), it was not 
necessary for women to learn to drive -
they had their husbands. 

All I can say is that those women have a 
high level of tolerance. My yiayias actually 
believe that it is normal to stop on the on· 
ramp and wait until the slow lane is free of 
cars, or that it takes three·and·a·half hours 
to get to the supermarket down the road. 

I ask my yiayia Elenee, who puts down her 
National Enquirer to tell me (I'm sure) how 
mean Doris Day's mother has been to her 
talented daughter, if there were cars around 
her small Greek village when she was 
young. She tells me that she had to leave her 
village, Galaxidi, when she went to college. 

"My brothers worked hard and sent me to 
college in Pireaus. My mother came (with 

Hondros' car was towed 'away this weekeNd. 

me) and we rented a small room in one big 
apartment for six families. My mother was 
so clean, like your mother, so the lady who 
owned the apartment say to my mother, 
'Kyria Chrisafo, I let you cook in my kitchen 
since you so clean.' We had one small room, 
10 drachmas a month, and (the room) just 
hold one bed and one little table, and sleep 
with my mother." 

A gust of wind rushes through the screen 
door, sending her Enquirer off the table. She 
continues. 

"After I get mr diploma, I move back to 
Galaxidi. When I m teaching I walked every 
day seven·and·a·half blocks to and seven· 
and·a·half from the school." You see, she 
explains, cars were only found in the large 
cities of Athens and Piraeus , "not in small 
villages . " 

And later, when she was married and 
living in America, times were "tough" on 
their Imperial Valley farm, so she and her 
husband Paul could only afford to have one 
car. 

"Paul drive me everywhere - we never 
went apart. He told me , 'No need to drive. ' " 

Then she laughs . "One time, on a rough 
road between Jacumba and Campo, have the 
three kids in the back seat , Paul say, 'Helen, 
supposed you learn to drive, because you tell 
me so many times.' I take the wheel , and 
boy, ~o so fast! I get so scared, never wanted 
to dnve ~ain ." 

I ask her if she's regretted this decision. 
She shakes her head . "I wish sometimes, 

but now it's too late. Because the condition 
I'm in, what if I'm on the road and the artery 
become plugged? Okay if I'm hurt, but don t 
like to hurt anybody else." 

She looks at me, smiles, and asks if I 
would mind taking her to Vons to pick up 
some bananas that are on sale. 

What would you sat? 

Nuclear fear. is on target 
Editor: 

Con~atulations to the 
Guardian and to Dorothy 
Houston for the excellent 
article, "A Nuclear Run· 
away" (Guardian, March 2). 

In the first years of the 
nuclear age statesmen used 
to cou1?le pronouncements 
about 'mutual deterrence" 
and "balance of terror" with 
assurances that nuclear war 
was "unthinkable." In recent 
years it has become q~ite 
thinkable for the Umted 
States, the Soviet Union, 
China and various Third 
World governments which 
see'the possession of nuclear 
".capacity" as a quick way to 
increase their influence in 
world affairs. 

All other serious issues, 
whether they be taxes, 

bu~et slashes, border wars, 
environmental pollution or 
depletion of natural 
resources absolutely pale 
before the overwhelmingly 
crucial issue of nuclear 
disarmament. 

M . Houston need not have 
been the least apologetic 
about being "emotional and 

scared~" If world public 

opinion cannot reverse the 
present course of armaments 
It is virtually inevitable that 
by some miscakulation or 
accident or sadistic insanity 
some "statesman" and his 
colleagues will in the 

proximate future incinerate 
hundreds of millions of 
persons and poison large 
portions of the globe in the 
first few hours of a "first 
strike."

Meet the chancellor 
Editor: 

I was able to attend an 
event last- Friday that I have 
never seen occur before in all 
my years at UCSD: In the 
North Conference Room, 
Chancellor Atkinson met 
with students and staff to 
respond to a variety of 
questions. 

Questions were raised 
concern ing co-op housing, the 
campus bookstore, minority 
faculty and staff positions 
and int~rcollegiate athletics, 
to mentIOn a few. 

I was pleased with the 
fran kness of Chancellor 
Atkinson's answers and the 
good rapport and relaxed 
atmosphere he seemed to 
estabh h with the people 
attending. 

I com mend Dr. Atkinson 

and the ASUCSD for joining 
together on this cause. In 
addition, I am pleased to hear 
,that these meetings will be 
every Friday at 11 am. 

I recommend these Friday 
meetings to all students. If 
you have concerns You want 
to voice, attend; there may be 
no better person that can 
respond to your concerns.

Emory Tolbert must be granted ten ure 
He's a good researcher .. 

Editor: 
Profe sor Emory Tolbert of t he 

hi tory department cannot be denied 
tenure unles something i very 
wrong with the UCSD tenure process. 
Thi Ph.D is extremely qualified as an 
instructor, as a researcher and as an 
asset to t he community. Granting Dr. 
Tolbert tenure will improve the 
academic climate at UCSD as well as 
help the entire UC system. 

With Professor Tolbert a s a 
permanent member of the UCSD 
history department, the foundations 
for an Afro ·American Studies 
program will be set. A college 
education should be well balanced. A 
diversity of electives alone will not 
makft this balance effective, but a 

qualified individual to aid in the 
learning proces will make it effective. 
Dr. Tolbert is one uch indi vidual. 

According to the CPEC study 
(Guaridan. march 3), ''The number of 
wo men a nd eth nic minorities 
employed by UC in facu lty and 
ex ec u t ive positio ns ... in c r ease d 
slightiy ... but not enough to achieve 
parity with white males in the same 
jobs." Granting Dr. Tolbert the tenure 
he has earned will be a positive step in 
correcting the underrepresentation of 
minorities in the UC system. 

Therefore the only just decision 
that the UCSD history department 
can make is to welcome Dr. Tolbert to 
the department permanently.

And he's respected too 
Ed itor : 

The trial concerning tenure for Dr. 
Emory Tolbert vs. the UCSD 
Administration is now in session , the 
honorable Judge·Chancellor Richard 
Atkinson preesiding. The said Dr. 
Tolbert, a professor of Afro·American 
St udies in t he UCS D hi s tory 
department , is again up for review for 
tenure by members of UCSD (i.e., 
other tenured professors within the 
history department and Chancellor 
Richard Atkinson). 

Two years ago this professor was 
denied tenure due to insufficient 
evidence concerning the number of 
publications he has managed to 
produce and present before the 
administrative board at this 
university. 

On behalf of Professor Tolbert , let 
me state that this professor has a 
more than adequate amount of 
publication in his field of study. His 
publicatiQn on the Garvey Movement 
of the 1920s is evidence of his ability to 
show a sufficient amount of expertise 

types, trained and supplied by Cuba 
and following the Russian plan." 
Asked why the US·supported forces 
here kill , torture and maim so many of 
their own people, the official recites 
the same rationalizations that one 
heard about the South Vietnamese 
army from US officials in Saigon so 
many years ago: "They need more US 
help. " 

Of L"Uurse, to travel through Central 
America is also to encounter many 
intelligent, well·informed US official 
who are deeply disturbed about 
America's growing entanglements 
here. But no more than in Saigon and 
Washington under Johnson and Nixon 
have such officials set either the tone 
or direction of America 's policy. As in 
Indochina, those most isolated from 
reality of Central America are also 
those most in step with an emerging 

for tenure in thi particular area. 
In addition to thi publicat ion, 

Professor Tolbert ha received great 
reviews from variou profes ors from 
other universities, as well as from 
individuals within the academic 
realm, concerning the great amou nt of 
knowledge he has displayed in writing 
on this subject. 

If this professor is again denied 
tenure, there will be questions raised 
as to how professors of color are 
reviewed for tenure by this 
university. The steady disappearance 
of Black professors such as Dr. 
Tolbert and other professors of color 
(a decrease from 36 to 18 since 1974) 
who are denied tenure is evidence of a 
systematic effort by the UCSD 
administration to bar these professors 
(Ngubo, Romo, Anderson and others) 
from further teaching in the future at 
this university. 

UCSD's poor record of maintaining 
these kinds of professors in becoming 
a part of the tenured faculty can weigh 

US commitment here. 
In democratic but economically 

troubled Costa Rica , a US official 
surveys the country's worsening 
plight and observes: "The Costa 
Ricans have been wasting their money 
for years, and now the chickens are 
coming home to roost." Asked to 
identify the chief areas of waste, he 
points to Costa Rica's widely admired 
svstems of edUCAtion , health care and 
sOcial security. The official waves 
away the collapse of coffee prices in 
the US as having any relationship to 
Costa Rica's problems. "Coffee prices 
are always going up and down," he 
explains. "Costa Rica's problem is . 
that it stifles free enterprise." 

In Nicaragua, a high·ranking 
American official describes the 
actions of the Sandinistas with a 
sense of almost personal outrage.

continued from pa,e 1 

One student, a biology 
major, wanted the units 
assigned to particularly 
tough and time-ronsuming 
courses to be raised . 

"Some of my four unit 
classes are really the 
equivalent of six unit classes 
because of the time they take 
in outside work," said the 
student, who preferred to 
remain anonymous. It is too 

tou~ to take four classes 
each quarter and if the 
courses were weighted 
differently then "it would be 
possible to take fewer classes 
and still graduate in four 
years," he added. 

Atkinson agreed. 
"Some of the big, tough 

courses should be weighted 
differently. We've got to give 
consideration to the major 
courses," he said, promising 
to look into the matter. 

The next fellow togrumble 
was the manager of the ski 
team here. He complained 
about the meager funding 
intercollegiate sports receive 
here at UCSD. 

"UCSD doesn't have 
endowments and much 
alumni donations to call on," 
Atkinson parried. 

"We are not like USC that 
raises a huge amount of 
private money," he said. Nor 
do we anticipate that UCSD 
will ~et a significant amount 
of private money in the near 
future, the Chancellor added. 

"Therefore, the money has 
to come out of the Reg fees," 
he said. 

At this point, Atkinson 

voiced some complaints of his 
own. 

"There should be ' some 
effort for comparabi lity 
across the UC campuses - in 
athletics as well as housing 
prices. 

- "We (at UCSD) built our 
major facilities at an 
expensive time. It is not 
equitable that we pay more 
for housing than at UCLA 
~ust because they built in the 
30s and '40s and we built in 

the '60s," Atkinson said. 
"I don't have much power 

over this problem. It is for the 
AS (Associated Students) to 
do something about," he said. 

Atkinson also said there 
were no funds for the 
proposed racquetball facility, 
outdoor pool and large 
barnlike structure for 
student events. "The 
students would have to vote 
for a $30 dollar reg fee 
increase for these," he said, 
and "I'm not optimistic about 
this." 

But Atkinson did commi-
serate with the ski team 
manager. "Personall y, I 
believe sports are absolutely 
essentia l for the college 
experience , intramural as 
well as intercollegiate." He 
said he "is for maximizing 
the number of people who can 
participate. " 

"I like what we are doing 
here, but I just wish there 
were some better facili ties," 
he added. 

The open forum, sponsored 
by the AS, will be held every . 
Friday, but not during finals

The cheaper price, Osborn

attractive to students who 
now park for free on the 
street. 

The committee also plans 
to create new parking spaces 
by breaking the lots down 
into smaller compact spaces. 
This would create 330 new

Carpenter 
suit set for 
March 12 

A civil action brought by 
State Senator Paul Carpenter 
against UC President David 
Saxon has been scheduled for 
hearing on March 12, 1981 in 
Department 1, Los Angeles 
County Superior Court. 

The Carpenter action , filed 
April 1, 1980, allege that a 
March 21, 1980 letter from 
President Saxon alerting UC 
students to probable levels of 
tuition necessary in the event 
of the passage of Proposition 
9 on the June 3, 1980 ballot 
was an improper use of 
University funds. 

The suit seeks to require 
President Saxon to repay 
personally the cost of mailing 
the letter to 130,000 graduate 
and undergraduate students 
at the University's nine 
campuses. The cost of the 
mailing was $29,594.13. 

The action was originally 
set for scheduling on Feb. 10, 
but was delayed at Carpen-
ter's reouest. 

Saxon maintained that the 
letter was his duty to 
students as UC President, 
but critics noted that Saxon 
also spoke vociferously and 
often around the state 
against Prop. 9.

The February trial was resolved without 
testimony from either side. 

However, the SDSP couldn 't carry through 
its charges of police harrassment as intended 
since two of the key defendants had left San 
Diego by the time of the trial, Sosna said. 

The trial, originally set for last October, was 
postponed three times until last month. Sosna 
believes that this delay hurt the SDSP's case. 

He feels that the police department 
intentionally delayed the legal proceedings to 
avoid the strong public anti -draft sentiment 
prevalent in October and November. 

The police, refusing to release complete 
evidence, asked twice for postponement of the

Old drug a new 
cancer fighter 

UCSD radiologist Joel\a Utley, examining a 
drug first tested by the U.S. Army almost 20 
years ago, has discovered that WR-2721 can 
increase the amount of radiation that can be 
delivered to a tumor, thus killing more cancer 
cells. 

WR-2721 is given immediately before the 
radiation treatment begins. X-rays destroy 
cells by changing some of their own molecules 
into highly-reactive, unstable "free radicals," 
capable of fatally injuri~ the cell from within.

Fortunately, Christopher Pook

When you hear a thousand

There is a tremendous 
amount of prestige associated 
with being a GP driver, but they 
are not competing solely for the 
accolades; there is a also the 
matter of money. Organizers 
must put up $600,000 before the 
group will even consider racing . . 
The Ferrari drivers of the '79 
season made in the neighbor· 
hood of two million. That is just 
prize money, it does not take 
into account salaries or 
sponsorship money. Cash is not 
the motivating factor, it is the 
being on top of a fiercely 
competitive field.

The cars are very fast, 
accelerating from 0-60 in two 
seconds. At Long Beach, you 
will see them being thrown 
around the streets at average 
speeds of over 90 mph. They will 
hit over 170 on the straight· 
away, which is a freeway. 

Practice and qualifying starts 
Friday, March 13, with a 
supporting Formula Atlantic 
race on Saturday. A Formula 
Atlantic car is a smaller, less 
powerful version of a Formula 1 
car. I know a few of the drivers 
personally who will be 
competing in the FA race and I 
can guarantee you will see some 
risky overtaking maneuvers in 
that race.

On Wednesday, five 
members of the women's 
swim team plus one diver 
head east for the AlA W 
Division III Nationals to be 
held in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. 
Swim coach Bill Morgan is 
optimistic about the women's

chances. "We've hit times 
that would make last year's 
top 12 times in some events. 
Division III has become very 
competitive, but our goal is to 
go back there and score some 
points," said Morgan. 

Leading the team are last 
year's veteran nationals 
swimmers Claudia O'Brien 
and Sandy Groos.

competing on all three relays 
- the 400 medley, 400 free 
and 800 free relays. The 
season's final meet saw 
O'Brien narrowly miss 
qualifying in several 
individual events, but 
according to Morgan, her 
presence on the relays is 
important . "Claudia has a lot 
of leadership quality and 
when it's channeled in the 
right direct jon, she can really 
fire up the team," Morgan 
said. 

Groos, a Third College 
sophomore from San 
Clemente, combines a casual 
attitude toward swimming 
with a strong butterfly to 
make her a definite 
possibility in the Triton bid 
for nationals points. Groos 
will join teammate O'Brien 
on all three relays and will 
also be competing in the 200 
fly and 500 free. 

New to the team 'is Vicky 
Barker, a Third College 
junior from Hawthorne, Ca. 
Barker, who holds all 

important anchor position on 
the 400 free and 400 medley 
relays, has been labeled by 
Morgan as the key to these 
relays. "Vicky's the fourth 
person we've been looking 
for, she really gets psyched 
for the relays and does a great 
job," said Morgan. 

Joining these three women 

is a trio of talented freshmen 
- Mary Thorsness, Jackie 
van Egmond and Maureen 
Kavanaugh. 

Thorsness, another Third 
College student from 
Newbury Park, Ca., has 
qualified in the 500 and 1650 
frees and will also swim on 
the 800 free relay. "Mary's

Win first two 
Softball team has winning attitude 
BY STAN HONDA 

Sport. Editor 
While the goals of the 

women's soft ball coach do 
not seem to be unreasonable 
- to play .500 ball and instill 
a winning attitude among the 
players - he has already met 
his expectation of surpassing 
last season's win total. 

In fact, Dan Monteverde's 
team has doubled the number 
of victories accrued all last 
year by taking the first two 
games of the schedule. 

The squad last year 
managed only one win 
throughout the season, so the 
feat may not be too 
impressive. But the team, 
composed mostly of freshmen 
also has a freshman coach. 
Monteverde took over the 
head position this year 
expecting the team to have 
1M skill levels. But, he has 
found out differently. 

"The girls have shown 
good skills, " Monteverde 
says, which makes his job 
easier. "If you have the 
fundamentals, then other 
things can be taullht easilv." 

style easier. 
"I love it. But I don't want 

to sta rt again (w ith 
freshmen) next year," he 
says. 

The team started out the 
season with an impressive

Unfortu n ate ly for the 

Tritons they only had one 
day to prepare for USD. "I 
thought UCSD would give 
them (USD) a good game but 
we wouldn't win, " said 
Monteverde. Not only did 
UCSD give them a good 
game, the Tritons literally 
snared a USD rally out of the 
air. 

In the bottom of the last 
inning UCSD had a 14-10 
lead . A three run homerun 
pulled usn within one run . 
Wi th two outs the next batter 
singled, putting the winning 
run at the plate. A line drive 
headed for the outfield was 
nabbed by second 1;>aseman 
Julie Spatafore to end USD's 
rally and seal the Triton's 
v ictory . 

That excitement over, 
UCSD will prepare "one 
game at a time" for league 
matches that include LA 
Baptist, Pt. Lorna College and 
Loyola. P t. Lorna is the 
toughest of the four, but 
Monteverde sees the Tritons 
taking at least second place.

For women, the problem isjust the opposite 
- they are not uppo ed to shave their legs

which will be the focus of 
Smith's class for the public, 
says that the universe 
started out with a massive 
explosion - the "Big Bang." 
The consequences of that 
explosion are observed today 
in the expansion of the 
universe around us and in the 
presence of relic radiation in 
the form of microwaves 
which appear to fill the 
universe. 

It 's only been within the 
past few years that large, 
sophisticated telescopes have 
helped Big Bang advocates 
support their theory. In 
addition, these theorists have 
discussed what they believe 
are two possible fates of the 
universe: either continuous 
expansion, or collapse, Smith 
notes.

that issue to even·out rates

response from the AS," he 
said. 

"There has al 0 been little 
interest in recreational 
facilities and the need to 
examine a registration fee 
increase. Unfortunately, that 
referendum last year got tied 
down on technicalities, and 
now, with changing intere t 
patterns . we can't proceed. 

"I just can't do certain 
things. They have to do it. If 
they don't do it , no one will," 
he said. 

Atkin on had harsher 
words for the AS and its 
involvement in the search for 
a Vice Chancellor of 
Undergraduate Affairs .

Chancellor) Dr. Ledden told 
me this morning that the 
selection of t he students was 
based on commitment that 
they discuss deliberations of 
the committee, a violation of 
agreement and procedures 
that this campu and the C 
work under. 

"It will be difficult to 
proceed ... but it s houldn't be. 
I'm going to meet with people 
from the AS and their 
nominees (today)." 

The AS committee that 
appointed the two undergra-
duate representatives , 
Kathleen Shannahan and Lee 
Anderson, and alternate 
Diane Foster asked all three 
whether they wou ld be 
willing to discuss delibera-
tions of the search committee 
with the AS, Foster said 
yesterday. 

Foster' also said she would 
only do 0 in a generalized 
way. Shannahan and 
Anderson were unavailable 
for comment. 

"I think it's really 
important as a final 
psychological preparation," 
says Mary Thorsness. 

"It definitely helps, there's 
no question about that," says 
senior Jeff Bennet. "I don't 
mind doing it because it feels 
so good in the water, and it

continued from page 1 
"He started talking to the 

students at the table, until 
they all got up and left, and 
then he started talking and 
s inging to himself," the RA 
said, adding that the man 
was "irrational, the freakiest 
guy I've ever seen, " 

"He was hanging around 
the milk machine when an 
RA approached him and 
asked him to tep into the hall 
and an wer omequestions," 
said another RA, Kim 
Phillips, who was leaving the 
cafeteria when the incident 
took place. 

The struggle began when 
the man attempted to thwart 
two police officers' efforts to 
seize the gun, possibly a .38 
calibre, which weas in a 
leather case in the back of the 
man's pants, 

The pol ice prevailed, 
arrested the man and led him 
away from the cafeteria. 

Witnesses described the 
man as 5 and a half feet tall, 
blond, about 21 and 
disheveled . 

Both RAs contacted by the 
Guardian believe the man is 
not a student here. 

"He's bee~ around a lot and 
I've heard his name several 
times," said Revelle 
Assistant Resident Dean

David Strand. "But I don't 
know of any specific 
incidents in the past that her 
was involved in." 

''I've seen him hanging 
around the dorm lounges a lot 
and I understand he's had 
trouble with the police 
before," said Phillip,s. who 
has potted "Dutch ' on her 
dorm floor in the past. 

The threatened RA 
believes the man was 
instructed by the police to 
"never come back in the 
dorms again" last Sept., 
when an undisclo ed incident 
took place in a Revelle 
residence hall. 

The Revelle Dean's office 
is currently "trying to find 
out what the police are doing 
about the guy" before taking 
any action, Strand said. 

When contacted by the 
Guardian last night, campus 
police said only Police Chief 
Hugh French could release 
information concerning the 
case. French hung up twice 
on a Guardian reporter 
asking questions about the 
incident. 

The name "Dutch" was 
asigned the man because he 
is a native of Holland, the 
threatened RA said. 

"I think he speaks five 
languages, too," he added .
