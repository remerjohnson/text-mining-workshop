Five candidates attended the A.S. presidential debates last Friday, including two on brand-new slates that grew out of Student Voice! 
— which swept most election seats in recent years 
— and a three-person slate called NOW!

Candidates present were current A.S. President 
Utsav Gupta, on NOW!, Campuswide Senator Wafa 
Ben Hassine on Students First, Marshall College 

Senator Brian McEuen on 
Tritons First and independent 
candidates Thurgood Marshall 
College Chair Tan Dhillon 
and Muir College junior Joe 
Virgilio.

Independent candidates 
Sixth College senator John 
Condello and Muir College 
senior August Ryan Brenner 
did not attend.

The debates focused on the failed transportation 
referendum — which proposed raising student fees 
$40 per quarter, in order to maintain all campus 
shuttle lines — and the Winter Quarter student-
media funding freeze enacted by Gupta in response 
to Koala Editor in Chief Kris Gregorian’s use of a 
racial slur on SRTV.

Gupta defended the A.S. Transportation 
Committee’s recommendation to abandon the con-
tentious referendum, and said he formed a Defense of 
Public Transportation Committee to save the Blue and 
White shuttles without raising student fees.

“We’ve recommended proposals and other sorts of 
cuts,” Gupta said. “We wanted to explore other refer-
endums so that any referendums that do come before 

Transportation referendum, media 
freeze dominate discussionss.

After an unexpected surge in requests from stu-dent-media organizations for more money, the A.S. Council is searching for a way to fund UCSD’s 13 
active student-run publications for Spring Quarter. Media 
orgs requested $62,511.31 in funding this quarter, nearly 
double that of the 29,897.48 requested last quarter.

According to Vice President of Finance and Resources 
Peter Benesch, the A.S. Council allotted $45,000 to media 
organizations this year, estimating that $15,000 would be 
used each quarter. Instead, $23,114 was allocated in Fall 
Quarter and $25,912 was allocated in Winter Quarter. 

This quarter, $39,393 is being allocated to media organiza-
tions — leaving the council with a large deficit.

B.o.B. to Play Main Stage
By Janani Sridharan
Senior Staff Writer

After teasing students a week ago 
with bookmarks listing a partial lineup 
of this year’s Sun God Festival, Associate 
Vice President of Concerts & Events 
Alex Bramwell has named B.o.B., Crash 
Kings and The Parson Redheads as the 
remaining Sun God acts. 

They will join Drake, Relient K, 
Thrice and Michelle Branch on the 
main stage. Deejay acts Designer Drugs, 
Skeet Skeet, Robbed By Robots and 
Shark Attack will perform in the festi-
val’s dance tent, leading up to a set by 
headlininger DJ Z-Trip.

The idway stage will host perfor-
mance by student organizations Donald 
Glover, Joe Mande and Dan Mintz. 
Cirque Berzerk, a troupe of gothic tra-

peze artists from Los Angeles, will take 
to the stage periodically throughout the 
day. 

Bramwell said students’ reactions to 
the lineup released a week ago have 
been mixed. 

“The general reaction has been very 
positive,” Bramwell said. “Of course, 
there are going to be complaints and 
some people are upset. ... We definitely 
don’t just choose whoever we feel like 
booking. Any name you could throw 
out as a suggestion for a headliner, we’ve 
likely checked [to see] if they are avail-
able or not, and if they’re an option.”

The festival’s total budget, which is 
drawn from student fees guest ticket 
sales, is roughly $690,000. Bramwell said 
security for the festival — including UC 

A.S. Council forced to compensate for 
spike in student-publication requests.

POORLY DRAWN LINES By Reza Farazmand

— is approximately $50,000. 

“We spend less than half of our 
budget on booking acts, because of 
production and security costs that 
limit the money that we can spend on 
artists,” Bramwell said.

Last year, according to 2008-09 
AVP Concerts & Events Garret Berg, 
ASCE spent about $550,000 on Sun 
God Festival, $40,000 of which went 
to security and about $120,000 of 
which went toward the talent budget.

Twenty thousand wristbands will 
be created for the event. Of these, 3,500 
will be set aside for guests and sold for

At an A.S. meeting on March 31, 
councilmembers debated whether to 
pull the money from mandate reserves 
— the council’s surplus from previous 
years — or from money intended to 
fund non-media student orgs.

Benesch said the council has not 
made an official decision on where 
the media funds will be pulled from. 

“I was the only one who suggest-
ed that we actually need to reallocate 
money so we can have some sort of 
sense of how much money we have left 
in other accounts,” Benesch said. 

According to Benesch, 12 coun-
cilmembers abstained from the vote 
last Wednesday on where the fund-
ing should be drawn from, claiming 
they didn’t want to be responsible for 
making the decision. The council will 
vote again at this week’s meeting.

Additionally, Transfer Senator 
Adam Powers has reopened the 
media-org committee created by A.S. 
President Utsav Gupta during Winter 
Quarter to reexamine the funding 
guidelines. According to Powers, 
the committee aims to ease current 
guidelines with changes such as cre-
ating an emergency reserve for last-
minute issues. 

Associate Vice President of 
Student Organizations Andrew Ang 
said he supports the committee’s 
goals.

“I think that we should allo-
cate more money, and I don’t think 
$45,000 is enough,” Ang said. 

Benesch said he is concerned 
that such lax standards will open the 
floodgates for requests in the future, 
forcing the council to spend its funds 
unwisely.

“It’s the most ludicrous thing I’ve 
ever heard,” he said, “You need some 
sort of fiscal discipline. If you believe 
that this is a one-time occurrence, 
then maybe that would be appropri-
ate. But it’s my opinion that it’s only 
going to get larger.”

Out of the 13 media organiza-
tions that requested money, three 
were brought in for a council inter-
view because they either submitted 
a request for an overly large sum of 
money, or because they represented a 
new publication.

One major funding request came 
from No. 15, a newly established fash-
ion and arts magazine that requested 
$8,693 — the entirety of which was 
approved. In addition, the A.S. Council 
fully approved humor newspaper the

$40 each. This year, wristbands will 
be available on the Thursday before 
the festival, in addition to the day of 
the event. They can be retrieved from 
Marshall Field on Thursday, May 13 
from noon to 6 p.m., and on Friday, 
May 14 starting at 9 a.m.

“If students have class on 
Thursday and Friday, they can decide 
which classes are more important and 
pick up their wristbands on the best 
day,” Bramwell said. 

Last year, student wristbands 
could only be picked up on the day 
of the festival. Many concertgoers 
— worried by the fact that Sun God 
2008 had run out of student tickets 
— crowded the lines Friday morning 
and spent up to four hours waiting to 
pick up their wristbands. According 
to Bramwell, there were roughly 
1,000 wristbands left over after the 
2009 festival. 

“Last year, we didn’t sell out,” he 
said. “I’m not concerned [about run-
ning out of tickets], and I would 
advise students that they don’t neces-
sarily need to be concerned and they 
can come on Friday to pick it up. Of 
course, no promises can be made.” 

Bramwell said he hoped that mov-
ing the distribution to Marshall Field 
will help keep the line more con-
tained and easier to regulate by cam-
pus police. 

Following the annual Battle of the 
Bands and the first-ever DJ Battle 
Dance Party — which took place over 
the weekend at the Loft — student act 
Diversion Sound and deejays J-Sharp 
and Barons of Bass will also perform 
at the festival.

T he Guardian editorial board has been skeptical of a Condello candidacy ever since he tried to melt the student-media freeze with his 
bare hands last quarter.

After a series of tipsy committee 
meetings with campus-newspaper 
leaders that ballooned his head to 
epic proportions, that cocky son of a 
gun sauntered into the A.S. Council 
meeting with nothing to show for 
hours of “deliberation” (read: chair 
swivelation, ball bustation). It was 
an overconfidence that allowed Vice 
President of Finance and Resources 
Peter Benesch to come dangerously 
close to pushing a well-prepared, 
content-biased funding model 
through council.

Then there’s the fact that 
Condello has an absence record like 
a battlefield, two untouched sena-
tor projects and one of the hottest 
tempers in the room. Last Friday, he 
missed the presidential debates in 
Price Center Plaza, and has proven 
five times less likely to answer 
our phone calls than current A.S. 
President Utsav Gupta.

But do we really want Gupta 

answering our calls when all we can 
get out of him is the same old dodgy 
press release? What sets Condello 
apart from Gupta is that he wears his 
heart on his sleeve. He’s completely 
unscripted — often to a fault — but 
we’d rather know what our president 
is thinking than watch him whisper 
it among his office entourage. 

Unlike the current president, 
Condello has his priorities straight. 
Sloppy and angry as his performance 
may have been, the Sixth College 
senator was one of the only council-
members during the funding freeze 
to sacrifice his poker face for the 
absolute protection of student rights. 
Gupta and Benesch’s proposal would 
have given self-important A.S. kids 
the right to choose which newspa-
pers could thrive on campus. Not 
only would that be a fucking snore, it 
would be downright unconstitutional. 

In a way, it will break our hearts 
to see the current president go. 
Gupta is one of the hardest-working 
student politicians we’ve ever 
encountered on the council  — even 
if he has estranged half his govern-
ing body and entered annoying legal 
battles like making the council into a 
501(c)(3) organization and trying to 
shut down the Koala. Yeah, he would 
probably get a lot more paperwork 
done than Condello. But at this 
point, no affinity for gruntwork can 
make up for the skewed, isolated ide-
ologies Gupta has revealed himself 
to hold over the last couple months.

Of the other candidates, no one 
beats Condello in consistency and 
likability. Tritons First frontman 
Brian McEuen says all the right 
things, but his goals are lackluster, 
his contributions are impossible to 

track and he makes us feel like we’re 
talking to a teleprompter. Students 
First figurehead Wafa Ben Hassine is 
a doer and a dreamer, but her dev-
astating political correctness is off-
putting to the average student, and 
her record of emotional investment 
in certain issues could make for toxic 
council relations.

Independent candidate Tan 
Dhillon also shows promise, but 
he could use a year on council to 
understand the hot mess he’d be 
dealing with, and his presidential 
swagger is in dire thirst of some 
Obamafication. As for independents 
August Brenner and Joseph Virgilio 
— hope you guys at least got laid on 
the “I’m a presidential candidate” 
pitch.

If this was high school, Condello 
would be the candidate with “cool 
kid” syndrome, but we think there’s 
just enough UCSD nerd in him to 
fuel the late-night Excel binges and 
student-org visits. He did completely 
change the direction of the shady 
nonaffiliate speech policy commit-
tee last year, and has proven he can 
wake up at 4 a.m. for crew practice. 
Plus, in the end, Condello knows the 
ultimate peacekeeper is a nice, cold 
beer. It’d be refreshing if the A.S. 
Council could finally earn a little 
cred with its constituency by doing 
what college students are supposed 
to do.

Most importantly, whether or not 
Condello hits the grindstone as hard 
as he says he will, at least he won’t 
do more harm. He’s far more cau-
tious about the idea of a D-I football 
team, and won’t waste any more time 
trying to defund the Koala. Sorry, 
Gupta — it was good while it lasted.

I n the past, the vice president of student life might as well have been called the VP Sun God. Year after year, diversity and 
athletics have been thrown to the 
wayside by a bubble event planner 
who loves fliers, music and parties. 
If elected, Desiree Prevo, who’s 
running on the Students First slate, 
will change all that.

As a board member on the 
Black Student Union and a cur-
rent A.S. campuswide senator, she 
played an instrumental role in 
drafting the BSU’s list of demands 
and sustaining resistance in the 
aftermath of Winter Quarter’s rac-
ist events. Her close ties with the 
Students for Affirmative Action 
Committee will ensure outreach 
and retention won’t be ignored in 
favor of a few annual concerts.

Prevo — a calm, rational think-
er — also believes that defund-
ing the Koala isn’t the answer 
to improving UCSD’s campus 
climate. 

Incumbent VP Student Life 
Ricsie Hernandez has, to put it 
lightly, taken a hands-off leader-
ship role this year — especially in 
ensuring AVP Concerts & Events 
Alex Bramwell didn’t completely 
ruin Sun God with another under-
whelming lineup.  

Prevo’s plan to have weekly 
check-ins and improve communi-
cation within her office may seem 
an easier-said-than-done response 
to the current lack of supervision, 
and it’s a bit concerning that she 
lacks a specific vision for what she’d 
like to see each of her three associ-
ates accomplish. But her greatest 
strength as a candidate lies not so 
much in her specific plans for the 
three sectors of Student Life — 
Diversity, Concerts & Events and 
Athletics — as in her demonstrated 
passion for reform. Her commit-
ment to diversity is an especially 
strong indicator that she’d expand 
the office to become more than a 
sideline Sun God cheerleader. 

It’s worth noting that Prevo’s 
opponent, Kristina Pham of the 
NOW! slate, has a host of awesome 
ideas — such as restoring after-
noon concerts at Price Center in 
the week leading up to Sun God. 
But unlike Pham and Tritons First 
candidate Nicole Metildi, Prevo 
has already proven herself both a 
competent leader and an honest, 
sensible strategist — two qualities 
to value in a VP who promises 
to pump new life into those two 
neglected parts of Student Life.

OPINION� MONDAY, APRIL 5, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 5 

O ur long-deliberated choice to endorse Josh Grossman for Vice President of Finance and 
Resources comes with quite a 
few reservations. His intention 
to use thinly veiled media-org 
funding rules to pursue the 
shutdown of the Koala, for 
example, demonstrates that he 
is just another sketchy Peter 
Benesch character.

Not only would such an 
endeavor be a waste of the 
VP Finance’s time and poten-
tially cost the university a lot of 
money in legal battles, it’s also 
extremely divisive and harmful 
toward other media that might 
get caught in the crossfire. The 
convictions expressed in his 
interviews, furthermore, show 
that he is dangerously out of 
touch with student opinion. 

It’s not unreasonable to 
assume that, if both Gupta and 

Grossman are elected, they 
will make the most toxic com-
bination since vodka met Red 
Bull. Except instead of a lethal 
hangover, they would cause a 
divided council and a whole lot 
of wasted time and money. 

But Grossman’s edge over 
competitor Andrew Ang is 
his fiscal responsibility. With 
student fees at an all-time 
high, reducing unnecessary 
spending within the council’s 
budget should be a top priority. 
Grossman has said he’ll scru-
tinize every item in the budget 
before it’s approved ,and is 
ready and willing to place limits 
and on A.S. spending — some-
thing Ang, having been burned 
for his non-content-neutral 
attempt earlier this year, is now 
too cautious to feel comfortable 
doing.

Given the likelihood that 
administrators try to dip into 

the A.S. funding pool next 
year, we need a VP who will 
hold his ground against outside 
interests. Ang seems to crumble 
to anybody’s will if it’s strong 
enough, while Grossman’s 
position in the A.S. committee 
to review the Transportation 
Referendum shows an ability 
to put in the research and resist 
administrative blackmailing.

As proposals like the 
Transportation Referendum 
have shown, we are going to 
need someone with concrete 
plans for the budget, and the 
backbone to stay the course 
— we just wish Grossman’s 
commendable financial policy 
didn’t come in such a poten-
tially disastrous package. It’s 
going to be Grossman’s job to 
be a “watchdog of student fees” 
— not shut down the Koala. 
Hopefully he’ll learn early on to 
stick to his job description.

Abubbly Eleanor Roosevelt College sophomore with a Justin Bieber haircut, Michael Raimondi has chosen his senatorial goals wisely: 
He wants to help students understand how to navigate administrative 
roadblocks and partake in campus sustainability. 

As an Econaut working with Housing, Dining and Hospitality 
Services, Raimondi’s administrative know-how has generated some 
refreshing proposals. He plans to educate students about RAs and 
petitioning classes, reduce superfluous A.S. printing and recruit more 
trash cans and student art. He may not have the strongest grasp on 
how to help failing enterprises like the Grove Cafe, but he knows that 
something needs to change — even if it’s something as simple as add-
ing a more visible sign. RAIMONDI

OK, we’ll admit Roberson isn’t very experienced when it comes to A.S. Council politics. But anyone who drops by a four-hour coun-
cil meeting because she thinks it’s “interesting” would be an asset to 
our council. Plus, there’s something to be said for a senator as engag-
ing and amiable as Roberson. She’s a BSU member with a talent for 
informing those who don’t understand; her welcoming personality and 
reasonable demeanor will help her reach out to a large variety of stu-
dents and help them see why diversity should be a campus priority.

Being a longtime runner on the track team, she’s also valuable as a 
representative of the athlete’s perspective on council matters — which 

will hopefully result in more coordination with the 
Athletics Department.

Our only worry is that Roberson will be so busy 
studying for chemistry and jumping hurdles next year 
that she’ll let her senatorial obligations fall to the way-
side. But considering her success in time management 
thus far, we’re betting she won’t let us down.

Every platform supports increasing the number of on-campus events, but Eleanor Roosevelt College 
sophomore Zoe Seher’s intense involvement with the 
student-org system proves she has the skills and connec-
tions — not just the ideas — to get the job done. 

Seher has structured plans for putting on cultural events and 
art fairs, thanks to her time at the Center for Student Involvement. 
Hopefully, she can even impart this know-how onto her more clueless 
peers. She wants to teach students about event finance and how to 
fill out paperwork; about how to rent space in Price Center for free, 
so there is more speech about controversial issues; about org delega-
tion and retention. She wants to host more events on campus, and she 
actually knows how to do it. Imagine that. SEHER

ZOE

Though generally inexperienced in the way of administrative bureau-cracy, Marshall’s main appeal lies in his levelheaded approach to issues 
he’s passionate about: athletics and student outreach. 

Unlike most pro-football councilmembers, Marshall has personally 
gauged student opinion on the subject, and constructed a solution that 
considers alternative funding. His opinion that the A.S. Council must 
find a way to defund the Koala may compromise free-speech ideals, but a 
dissenting opinion would still benefit discussions on the topic next year. 

Though Marshall is most passionate about football, his well-played 
actions during the “Compton Cookout” fiasco impressed us most. While 
many sacrificed diplomacy for easy-to-shout slogans, Marshall kept 
communicating his viewpoints rationally in public forums and rallies, 
encouraging dialogue between upset and frustrated groups of students. 
His mature level of involvement will be an invaluable asset for the A.S. 
Council next year.

UCSD’s tornado of student leaders — A.S. hotheads, SAAC activists, student-media diehards — often become so wrapped up in themselves 
that they forget to take into account the sentiments of the remaining 
80 percent: the students who would rather their fees go toward stock-
ing essential lab equipment than the Sun God lineup. Jason Caffrey will 
always err on the side of conserving the council’s $3 million, and funnel-
ing it back, wherever possible, into the academic experience.

More than your average Geisel geek, Caffrey also has a grasp on which 
documents he would need to present to which departments to make 
headway in cutting costs. Sure, he might stick out like a Ticonderoga in a 
room of bleeding ballpoints. But his cynicism — and indifference to luxu-
ries like a D-I football team — is refreshing, and, unlike most average-Joe 
candidates before him, Caffrey has stumbled through enough dron-
ing A.S. minutes to know a referendum from a resolution from a First 
Amendment lawsuit.

V ague buzzwords like “outreach” and “diversity” have been choice vocabulary on the campaign trail this year. One of the few senato-
rial candidates to present a clear idea of how she’d actually pursue 
those grand ideals, though, Chua plans to encourage activism both 
on campus and in Sacramento. She’s passionate about fighting fee 
increases and pushing for the D.R.E.A.M. Act, which would make 
undocumented immigrant students eligible for financial aid.

They’re goals that are, granted, pretty lofty for a lowly senator 
with three short quarters to push an agenda. But unlike 
most of her opponents, Chua has experience lobbying the 
capital and has spent two years as an intern in the A.S. 
External Affairs office — which, along with a fleshed-out 
agenda, sets her apart from this year’s crop of inexperi-
enced slate puppets.

Don’t let her cute little freckles fool you: As the most qualified campuswide senator candidate this spring, 
Elman means business. A superstar member of the 
Student Sustainability Collective, Elman is experienced in 
navigating administrative bureaucracy.

In other words, when she says she wants to make Sun 
God Festival more sustainable and encourage the use of public transpor-
tation next year, we believe she’s got the know-how and drive to make it 
happen.

She’s also well-informed about a slew of other issues sure to plague 
the council next year. She’s a tree-hugger who understands the impor-
tance of the California Democracy Act and doesn’t think students should 
foot the bill for the Loft or a football team when tuition is shooting 
through the roof. And, in regard to the media freeze, she said she wants 
to increase access to funds rather than add regulations. Right answer.

Now, if only she’d try and run this entire mess of a council.

A fter the eye-opening racially charged events last quarter, it’s difficult to deny the importance of enacting some well-orchestrated efforts to 
educate our campus about cultural diversity. 

Like many others in the Students First slate, Elizabeth Garcia has 
staked her candidacy on this hot issue. Though only a Muir College 
freshman — and a generally uninformed one at that — Garcia shows 
potential of becoming an effective leader for her cause.

Most of all, Garcia demonstrates the kind of eloquence necessary to 
ensure both cooperation between colleagues and a rational mindset in 
answering the controversial questions now facing the A.S. Council. 

Seeing as she hasn’t even been here a year, it’s hard to predict whether 
Garcia will follow through. If she catches on quick, though, she has the 
potential to become one of the council’s most effective senators.GARCIA

WHY WE ENDORSE HIM
His experience in the External
Affairs office ensures he’ll get 
things done in Sacramento.

I t’s been a busy year for student activists. A mas-sive tuition increase, a contentious debate 
over racial sensitivity and 
minority retention on cam-
pus, student-loan reform 
and an ongoing statewide 
dialogue about the contro-
versial D.R.E.A.M. Act have 
meant a packed schedule 
for the A.S. Office of 
External Affairs. 

Next year will no doubt 
prove just as critical for 
student mobilization as the 
last seven months. With 
that in mind, it’s clear the 
candidate most qualified 
to take the reigns of such 
efforts is Facundo Ramos.

Nearly three years of 
experience in the external 
office have given Ramos 

the knowledge, the back-
ground and the ideas 
necessary to head up a new 
year of student-led political 
activism. 

He intends to rein-
vigorate efforts to directly 
engage with lawmakers, and 
has plans to join up with 
the United States Student 
Association and take his 
activism to the national 
stage — a much-needed 
step toward letting those 
who can make a difference 
hear what we have to say. 

Under the mentorship 
of current Vice President of 
External Affairs Gracelynn 
West, Ramos has been 
schooled in the ways of 
effective organizing and 
dedication to the student 
cause. 

Despite his qualifica-
tions, however, there are 
certain points of concern 
about Ramos. As the 
brother of immigrant rights 
activist Matias Ramos, he 
seems likely to focus the 
bulk of his efforts on mobi-
lizing students in favor of 
the D.R.E.A.M. Act.

He should keep in mind 
that as an elected official, 
he will be responsible for 
representing all students 
— which means making 
tuition costs and increased 
state funding for the uni-
versity a primary goal.

It wouldn’t hurt if also 
practiced his public-speak-
ing skills. While his experi-
ence is invaluable, it could 
all be wasted if no one is 
listening.

RESPONSIBILITIES
t�Complete at least two
projects each year, one of 
which must benefit the 
entire campus
t�Serve on at least two

you are as small as possible.”
In contrast, McEuen, Dhillon and Ben 

Hassine agreed that the decision to fail the 
referendum will result in cuts to shuttle services 
and therefore negatively affect students.

Dhillon said the funding issues now facing 
Transportation and Parking and Services could 
be remedied by creating more “S” spots that 
students could buy to fund the shuttles. 

In regard to the media freeze, Gupta claimed 
he never actively tried to defund controversial 
newspaper the Koala, or stop their distribution. 

“My concern has always been regarding 
our sponsorship of their publication, and I 
would defend their right to distribute their 
publication across the campus, as I have done,” 
Gupta said.

He added that he had been willing to explore 
the “government speech model” suggested by 
Vice President of Finance and Resources Peter 
Benesch, which would give the council discre-
tionary power to fund certain media organiza-
tions through advertisements. 

McEuen, who also ran with the Student 
Voice! slate last year, said he would have edu-
cated groups such as the Koala about diversity 
instead of targeting the publication because of 
its beliefs. 

McEuen said his slate aims to fund more 
student orgs and lobby externally. 

“We want to lobby not just the regents, but 
we want to go to the state level and the local 
legislatures, and lobby them to make sure that 
they understand that students are not going to 
stand for these drastic fee increases,” he said.

Ben Hassine said all students should be 
given the right to issue their publications if they 
are constitutionally protected.

“If media orgs don’t fall under such protec-
tion, we should take publications off campus 
through legal channels,” she said.

Ben Hassine said that, as a member of the 
media funding committee, she boycotted meet-
ings that she believed falsely pitted the Black 
Student Union and the media organizations 
against each other. 

“If we wanted to make our guidelines bet-
ter, let’s make a committee to find what’s illegal 
not go out there specifically for one org,” Ben 
Hassine said.

Ben Hassine added that, although her slate is 
geared strongly toward Students for Affirmative 
Action Committee  organizations, it will reach 
out to other constituents because of the social 
and ethnic diversity of her running mates.

Virgilio, who is running on a platform cen-
tered on improving student life, said he wants 
to bring more fun to UCSD, but is unsure about 
how to do so.

“[Creating fun] step by step, that’s not some-
thing that we can do,” Virgilio said.

The vice-presidential debates will take place 
on Monday, April 5, in Price Center Plaza at 
noon. Voting will begin the same day and con-
tinue until 4 p.m. on Friday. At 5:30 p.m., elec-
tion results will be announced at Round Table 
Pizza in Price Center. Students can vote both on 
TritonLink and Library Walk.

Koala’s $3,471 request to print its issue in full color.
According to Benesch, the allocation caused 

a divide amongst the councilmembers.
“[No. 15] was allocated more than I’ve heard 

of any media organization ever being allocated 
— ever,” Benesch said. “$9,000 approximately 
for one media organization to publish for one 
quarter — that’s one-fifth of what we’re supposed 
allocate out per year to one media organization.”

Ang believes the sum is a non-issue. 

“They requested a lot because of the nature 
of their magazine,” he said. “It’s a fashion maga-
zine, and they wanted to develop a publication 
that was also a work of art. We have a memo-
randum of understanding where they will never 
request that much again.” 

The council will revote on the issue at the 
April 7 meeting this week.

8 THE UCSD GUARDIAN� � MONDAY, APP

Gunning for re-election isn’t exactly what most A.S. 
Presidents plan for. Which isn’t to say last year’s indepen-
dent underdog, Sixth College senior Utsav Gupta, did 
either. Especially after he froze media org funding and, in 
turn, turned many students against him.

“I looked at the candidates running for president this 
year and honestly I was a little distressed,” said Gupta. 
“None of them had cabinet level experience, most were 
only in [the A.S. Council] for one year, and most didn’t 
do much while they were there.”

Since securing the A.S. presidency last year as an 
independent candidate, Gupta has spent his fourth year 
as a bioengineering major balancing his course load with 
lofty goals. As result, he’s had to cut down the usual five 
to six classes he takes a quarter — forcing him to stay 
another year.

The largest criticism of Gupta’s presidency is likely 
that he hasn’t quite finished much of what he’s started.

Take, for instance, Koala editor in chief Kris 
Gregorian calling the BSU members protesting the

In two short years on the heated A.S. 
Council floor, Thurgood Marshall College 
sophomore Brian McEuen has almost never 
slipped out of line. His words are few and 
carefully chosen, avoiding the emotional 
charge that often divides his fellow council-
members and drags meetings on.

In fact, McEuen’s place at the table might 
go unnoticed by a student unfamiliar with 
the council — if not for his stature. He’s a 
born politician, with kind eyes and a dash-
ing jawline. (The spitting image of current 
Vice President of Finance and Resources 
Peter Benesch — also known for his serene, 
sometimes slippery presence on the council).

You’d think McEuen was born for this. 
But when he was first recruited to UCSD by 
the men’s volleyball coach, the high-school 
senior never expected to end up in student 
government. However, he was cut after 
three short weeks as a Triton, and McEuen 
was soon hot on the hunt for a new team.

That’s when he headed to the fourth 
floor of Price Center East. He served as an 
A.S. freshman senator his first year, and has 
since moved into the position of Marshall 
College senator and senate vice chair.

All this, while juggling a Lambda Chi 
Alpha membership, UCSD club volleyball 
and a brewing den of homemade beer back 
home. (He is currently in the process of 
brewing his second batch, a red oak amber.) 

McEuen has also taken an extremely 
active role in presenting student con-
cerns to administrators: He sits on the 
Campus Affairs Committee, the Advisory 
Committee on Sustainability and the 
Registration Fee Advisory Committee.

Still, the senator’s decision to run for 
the council’s most powerful position — 
especially on a brand-new slate — was 
somewhat unexpected, considering he’s only 
a college senator going into his junior year. 
(Sixth College junior and fellow presidential 
candidate John Condello, a close friend of 
McEuen, is taking a similarly premature 
leap toward the top spot.)

The Student Voice! slate, which car-
ried McEuen into senatorship last year, was 
doomed to disintegrate after independent 
candidate and current A.S. President Utsav 
Gupta won by a landslide last spring, leav-
ing SV! candidate Erin Brodwin with only a 
few hundred votes.

Last February, after A.S. president 
Utsav Gupta made a split-second decision 
to freeze funds for all student newspapers, 
one senator in particular took the spotlight. 
Sixth College sophomore John Condello 
became the posterboy for Gupta’s opposing 
army, aggressively vocal about the absolute 
preservation of free speech on campus — in 
this case, free speech in the form of access 
to content-neutral press funding.

Condello’s impassioned participation in 
the debate — which at times became very 
personal at public forums and meetings, as 
well as over the A.S. e-mail listserv — was 
a testament to his commitment against a 
shady, over-bureaucratic council.

“My whole rule is just to take the 
bullshit out of A.S. and reconnect with 
the students, rather than this extension of 
high-school ASB and being the patsy for the 
administration,” Condello said.

The Sixth College senator argued that 
Gupta’s move to re-evaluate media funding 
guidelines was a thinly veiled attempt to 
defund controversial humor newspaper the 
Koala, which was contributing to racial ten-
sions on campus.

“[It was] about shutting down the 
Koala,” Condello said. “Just be honest about 
it — if you’re going to fuck someone over, 
just tell them you’re going to fuck them 
over.”

Though Condello — who became 
close friends with Koala members during 
the controversy — acknowledged that the 
publication’s content is often extremely 
offensive, he maintained that its purpose 
on campus is to ensure the right to express 
ideas freely. 

“I agree with none of the content of the 
Koala,” Condello said. “What I do agree 
with [is] some of the ideas behind it, which 
is the idea behind any media organization, 
and that’s to broaden people’s horizon.”

Gupta appointed Condello to a commit-
tee composed mainly of student-media rep-
resentatives, tasked with examining alterna-
tives to open funding of all publications. At 
the pinnacle of the controversy — a March 
10 A.S. Council meeting at which council-
members were to vote on the committee’s 
findings — Vice President of Finance and 
Resources Peter Benesch showed up with 
a PowerPoint unfamiliar to the rest of the

Compton Cookout “ungrateful niggers” on air. Though 
SRTV’s contract had only been renewed a mere weeks 
before the event, Gupta pulled the station’s plug nearly an 
hour after the violation. After that, he put a freeze on all 
media organization funding. 

The maneuver, Gupta says, was under his jurisdiction 
according to Section II of the A.S. Constitution which 
stipulates that the role of the council is “to create and 
execute programs which serve the collective interests of the 
undergraduate population.” According the Gupta, the cur-
rent media organization funding system was not serving 
the “collective interests.” Still, if he could do it again, he’d 
have done it differently. 

“If I were to go back with the knowledge I have now, 
I probably wouldn’t have had such an extensive freeze on 
media-org funding,” said Gupta. “I wouldn’t have let it go 
on for so long.”

According to presidential candidate and Sixth College 
Senator John Condello, who is a vocal supporter of free 
speech, the media freeze was a well-intentioned reflex. 

“He’s a smart guy,” said Condello. “He doesn’t do any-
thing without knowing months in advance. The only reac-
tionary move that I’ve seen him take is the media freeze.”

After the media freeze caused additional uproar, Gupta 

hosted a public forum that was largely attended by mem-
bers of the A.S. Council, the Black Student Union and vari-
ous media organizations. The forum resulted in the cre-
ation of two committees (the second replacing the first) to 
discuss media funding and free speech. In the end, because 
the second committee voted 5-13-5 against a government 
speech model proposed by VP Finance Peter Benesch, the 
media freeze was mandatorily lifted at the end of the A.S. 
Council’s last meeting, as stipulated by the council’s stand-
ing rules. 

“There should be some discretion involved in funding 
media organizations beyond a fixed set, if that makes sense, 
which is why I was advocating for the hybrid [government 
speech model] approach,” Gupta said.

Still, for many media organizations, Gupta’s misstep 
damaged their confidence in the A.S. President to make 
decisions on behalf of the student body. 

“I’m hoping I can work to rebuild some of that trust 
again,” said Gupta. “I didn’t do some sort of backhanded 
committee process to try and get specific legislation passed 
— everything was out in the open; I wanted media orgs to 
be part of the process. I’m hoping as the emotionality of the 
situation dies down, people will be able to see the specific 
realities of what happened versus what’s being presented or 

misrepresented.”
After deciding to run again for re-election, he’s focusing 

much of his campaign on continuing the projects he start-
ed this year — namely returning Sun God Festival to its all-
campus format and bringing Division-I football to UCSD. 
He’s also added collectivizing high education in San Diego 
in order to educate regional politicians about UCSD’s eco-
nomic benefits (so as to prevent tuition-increasing legisla-
tion), protect Shuttle Services from coercing council into 
a student fee referendum, keeping Geisel Library open late 
and looking into Greek and student leadership housing in 
his new campaign. 

According to Gupta, uncaging Sun God Festival has 
been a gradual process that — as expected — has met a 
lot of opposition. Though he’s brought back the Junkyard 
Derby to Library Walk as well as college council events 
during the day, he says he was prevented from bringing 
back student organization booths to Library Walk by the 
VP Student Life, AVP Concert & Events and AVP Student 
Organizations as well as Vice Chancellor of Student Life 
Gary Ratcliff “who waited until it was too late to change the 
direction of the booths.”

Marshall College junior Tan Dhillon 
is quick to describe himself as “the Indian 
guy who isn’t Utsav.” And with a collection 
of campaign promises aimed at rewiring 
how student government works at UCSD, 
he apparently aims to make this distinction 
very clear. 

Both Dhillon and Utsav Gupta — the 
current A.S. president now making a bid for 
a second term — have a year of experience 
as executives. As chair of the Thurgood 
Marshall College Student Council, however, 
Dhillon finds himself at the head of a con-
siderably smaller governing body. While 
TMCSC’s budget is $90,000 a year, the A.S. 
President oversees roughly $3 million in 
student fees.

But the frightening prospect of cam-
puswide governance hasn’t slowed Dhillon 
down at all. In his independent run for the 
council’s top position, he has worked to 
define himself from his pack of opponents 
— several of them seasoned A.S. insiders — 
by preaching empowerment, administrative 
accountability and unity. He’s even taking 
a few well-aimed shots at Gupta — an easy 
target, but an effective one nonetheless.

“Utsav hasn’t been working on unifying 
the council,” Dhillon said. “There’s a lot of 
division that hasn’t been addressed.” 

Dhillon’s vision takes him far beyond 
the confines of the council’s internal har-
mony as ell. As president, he pledges to 
combat the unfortunate nature of “campus 
monopolies” such as dining-dollar require-
ments, which Dhillon said lock students 
into paying dramatically inflated prices for 
food on campus. He said wants to end the 
abuse and play the empowerment card by 
overhauling dining package options and 
changing all dining dollars to Triton Cash 
— a move that would allow students greater 
spending flexibility and more eateries to 
choose from.

Though the promise is enticing, 
Dhillon has yet to work out the details with 
Housing, Dining and Hospitality Services. 
Given that the department could lose a 
substantial chunk of income by adopting 
the plan, Dhillon would face a rough battle 
if elected. 

“I do understand there is a strong oppo-
sition,” he said. “But what is the university

Last year, Muir College senior August 
Ryan Brenner held a Seder for his friends — 
complete with matza and karpas — to “raise 
cultural awareness” as his friend Doug 
Rosen put it. Brenner isn’t Jewish. The 
point of the party was just to bring people 
together.

Brenner, a San Mateo native who 
goes by Ryan, started his college career at 
UC Santa Cruz but transferred to UCSD 
because it was better for his chemical engi-
neering major. Now in his second year at 
UCSD, this Village resident has taken a new 
interest in campus politics — albeit in the 
most lighthearted sense possible.

According to Brenner, most of the other 
candidates for A.S. president are far more 
qualified, and he doesn’t have much chance 
of winning. 

“I talked to my friend in class and 
he said, ‘You should run for president,’” 
Brenner said. “I woke up the next day, had 
a research meeting, got out at 9 a.m., picked 
up a candidate packet, got 150 signatures 
and turned in the packet by 11 a.m.” 

Brenner’s only political experience to 
date is an office aide position he held dur-
ing his senior year of high school. But he 
abused those privileges, and — as punish-
ment for getting students out of class with 
office passes — Brenner was forced to read 
the school announcements. He was then 
kicked out of that position a week before 
graduation, after he badmouthed a certain 
teacher over the loudspeaker.

If elected, Brenner said his top priorities 
will be allowing students to start organiza-
tions at any time of the year and improving 
UCSD’s parking nightmare. 

According to Brenner, faculty ‘A’ spots 
should be moved across campus and more 
‘B’ spots should be changed to ‘S’ spots to 
benefit students. He’s also angered by the 
fact that campus employees have to buy 
their own parking permits. 

“They’re employed by the campus and 
spend 500 of their hard-earned dollars 
every year to work here,” Brenner said. “If I 
could do something about changing that, I 
would. I’d find out about it from a qualified 
person — if I’m somehow able to win.”

A firm advocate of free speech, Brenner 
said he doesn’t agree with current A.S. 
President Utsav Gupta’s Winter Quarter 

Almost every year, the A.S. presiden-
tial election has its maverick. Either he’s 
a Koala affiliate advocating more beer 
and partying, or a highly uninformed 
sacrificial lamb looking to bitch about the 
system.

But Joe Virgilio falls somewhere 
in between. The Muir College senior 
believes the answer to accomplishing 
anything and everything is to get rid of all 
these goddamn committees and “just do 
it” — though he’s often clueless to what 
that something is. (He’s also been cited 
lurking around the Koala office once or 
twice.)

Accordingly, it’s often hard to tell if 
Virgilio’s joking. At the A.S. presidential 
debate in Price Center Plaza on Friday, he 
addressed the audience awkwardly, with 
squinty eyes and trailing anti-slogans. 
When asked about how he might go 
about improving student life, he struggled 
with a couple incomplete thoughts and 
eventually concluded: “The students tell 
you what they want, and then you just do 
it.” When the conversation entered the 
land of acronyms, he grabbed the micro-
phone to say he was “sort of at a loss of 
what everybody’s talking about.”

Though Virgilio has never been to an 
A.S. Council meeting, he maintains that 
he hates it regardless. Too many commit-
tees. Too much talking. Too many people. 
Not enough action.

He’s especially not a fan of A.S. 
President Utsav Gupta, who is currently 
running for re-election. Virgilio claimed 
Gupta has not done anything during his 
presidency this year.

“I voted for him last year, you know, 
and it [seemed] like this guy would actu-
ally do things, and he didn’t — I mean, 
not that I [noticed],” Virgilio said in an 
interview. “Utsav just seems like a rich 
kid. He’s kind of smug. I don’t like him.”

Gupta, who was stifling laughter 
throughout the debate on Friday, did say 
later that Virgilio provides a valuable dia-
logue about the perspective of the average 
student.

Among Virgilio’s goals are keeping 
the library open, giving shuttles more 
funding, giving the co-ops more money, 
building a giant radio tower atop of KSDT

decision to freeze the funds of student 
media organizations in response to the 
actions of humor newspaper the Koala. 
Though he said he finds much of the 
content published in the Koala to be 
vulgar, Brenner made it clear that the 
students involved have the right to say 
whatever they want.

“What’s the harm? If you don’t want 
to read it, don’t read it,” Brenner said. “If 
you don’t like what it says, start a news-
paper and write anti-Koala stuff.”

According to Brenner, both his big-
gest challenge and accomplishment at 
UCSD is waking up in the morning. A 
typical week for Brenner includes going 
to “80 percent” of his classes, hanging out 
with friends and doing his homework. 

 “He’s really everywhere on campus, 
having a good time, and bringing people 
together,” said Eleanor Roosevelt College 
senior Douglas Rosen, who is Brenner’s 
friend of four years. 

Brenner’s strategy for victory is 
simple: make people smile. And as a 
ballsy conversationalist who likes out-

door adventures and collecting interest-
ing facts (about everything from cider 
to Passover), every once in a while he 
succeeds. 

“Ryan is a positive experience every 
time,” Rosen said. “He always makes 
everyone his friend. No one is upset 
meeting Ryan Brenner; he transcends 
his college. He makes six colleges one 
university.”

At UCSD, Brenner participates in the 
Tae Kwon Do Club and is a member of 
the Slavic Student Union.

After graduation, though, Brenner 
said he doesn’t want a lab job. Instead, 
he’s aiming to be James Bond or conduct 
research on aliens. 

“I’m pretty 100-percent confident 
that aliens exist somewhere in the uni-
verse,” Brenner said. “Whether they’re 
here on this planet is a very small pos-
sibility.” 

Brenner says he’s “pretty 100 percent 
confident” that aliens exits and that 
through more advanced, futuristic tech-
nology, it might be possible to find other 
life forms similar to humans, or that

students. HDH is not functioning in the 
students’ best interest, and that needs to 
be changed.”

Dhillon’s quest to stand up for the 
little guy — or, the student body — 
will take him to even greater heights. 
After spending a significant amount of 
time working with residential security 
officers during his time as a resident 
advisor, Dhillon is markedly disillu-
sioned with how officers treat students. 

“RSOs prey on the fact that stu-
dents don’t know their rights, and 
just barge in,” he said. “They’re overly 
aggressive, and it’s unacceptable.” 

To combat the perceived abuse, 
Dhillon said he aims to create a cam-
puswide awareness campaign to edu-
cate students about their on-campus 
rights from day one, and one to pro-
vide feedback on RSOs. If they can 
write us up, we should be able to write 
them up, according to Dhillon. If he’s 
elected, RSOs may soon find them-
selves subject to review by the students 
they are paid to keep an eye on.

This push for student rights is 
hardly a campaign tactic. Throughout 

his term as TMCSC Chair, Dhillon 
has actively pursued new avenues for 
students to voice their opinions on 
campus matters. When he learned that 
Marshall’s main administrative com-
mittees — the executive committee, 
the curriculum committee and the 
DOC committee — held no student 
positions, Dhillon wrote letters to the 
Marshall administration demanding 
that students be represented on the 
committees. He also insisted that rep-
resentatives not be selected by admin-
istrators. 

Like many candidates, Dhillon has 
also jumped in line with supporters of 
a plan to extend Geisel Library’s oper-
ating hours. But if that doesn’t work, 
he has a backup plan: convert Price 
Center East into a versatile, always-
open study space by adding more 
power outlets to accommodate laptops.  

But not everyone agrees that 
Dhillon’s experience and approach 
to leadership are what the university 
needs.

“I think Tan’s a nice guy,” said 
presidential candidate and Sixth 
College Senator John Condello. “But 

I think he demonstrated last night [at 
the ERC debates] in one of his quotes 
that he’s not able to lead when he said, 
‘Sometimes I think a leader needs to 
take a backseat role and know when to 
follow.’ I think that’d be great if he was 
running for a senator position.”

Gupta echoed Condello’s concerns.
“He has experience being a college 

council chair, but there’s no relation 
between being a college council chair 
and A.S. President.”

However, Dhillon said students 
can rely on his drive and selflessness. 
His passion for student life at UCSD, 
according to Dhillon, is directly influ-
enced by the lessons he took away 
from his upbringing. After two of 
Dhillon’s family members passed away 
from heart failure, he said he realized 
how much he wanted to help people.

“It’s not about the prestige — it’s 
about helping people, having a direct 
interaction and seeing a change,” he 
said. “People always say you have to 
aim high to reach high, and I want to 
do both.”

radio and installing more benches 
around campus.

“I want to see more benches. 
There’s a lot of walking and there’s no 
benches anywhere,” Virgilio said. “This 
really upsets me, actually. It might be 
my priority number one.”

The benches, Virgilio said, would 
allow him to avoid more public seat-
ing areas. Needless to say, he isn’t 
much of a people person. Ever since he 
transferred to UCSD in Winter 2009, 
Virgilio said he’s had trouble adjust-
ing. He’s uncomfortable around large 
crowds, and on-campus organizations 
aren’t really his thing.

“I had really bad anxiety, and I 
know a lot of other students that have 
anxiety when they come here as trans-
fer students,” he said. “It’s like, crip-
pling, almost; there are so many people 
and it’s just like, you don’t want to go 
to class, you don’t want to go to school 
even. I’ve overcome that.”

committee. It detailed a “government 
speech model,” which would allow the 
council to fund only the student press 
that reflected its own values. Condello 
had fire in his eyes.

“We should talk about why this is 
bad legislation,” Condello said at the 
meeting. “It is sketchy as hell — we 
agreed that there was going to be no 
PowerPoints.” [There is] a lot of back-
stabbing through the whole thing.”

Stacy Sluys, editor in chief of Sixth 
College newspaper the Sixth Sense — 
formerly staffed by Gupta and Condello 
— said she sees Condello’s passion as 
an attribute. However, Sixth College 
President Brian Ng said the senator’s 
emotional investment in issues can some-
times alienate other councilmembers.

“I think his passion — as much as it 
is his strength — can often sometimes be 
his weakness,” Ng said. “He can some-
times be too impassioned in debates.”

Condello agreed that his debating 
style can be overly aggressive, but said 
that when it comes to collaboration, he 
remains level-headed.

“I’m OK with that as long you can 
work with people after,” Condello said. 
“Everybody makes mistakes.”

If elected, Condello said he hopes to 
make the A.S. Council more transparent 
by talking to students individually. 

“Drink a coke with me, let’s get some 
pizza together and let’s talk about what 
you need to see changed,” Condello said. 
“Let’s work together and get it done. I 
don’t want to continue the self-imposed 
isolation that A.S. garnered over quite 
some time.”

According to Ng, Condello has 
proven his ability to make student gov-
ernment more accessible while working 
on the college level this year.

“He can definitely, and will, listen 
to a lot of students,” Ng said. “And that’s 
probably one of his greatest strengths: 
He has a charisma about him that a lot 
of people find very approachable. He 
understands students’ needs without the 
baggage that comes with being a part of 
student government for several years. 
I feel like sometimes folks can be very 
involved in student government but then 
often lose sight of what students’ values 
are.”

Condello said he is equally invested 

in standing up to UCSD administrators, 
who are often antagonistic toward stu-
dent interests.

“I don’t think that they’re some kind 
of ultimate evil,” Condello said. “I just 
think that what they see as the right 
thing to do is often very disparate from 
what the student sees as the right thing 
to do.”

Last quarter, Condello was one of 
several councilmembers who faced prob-
able impeachment due to 5.5 absences 
from council meetings, which are 
held every Wednesday night at 6 p.m. 
According to Gupta, that fact, along 
with his lack of experience, indicate that 
Condello isn’t prepared for the job.

“I think he made a lot of things 
personal against me, but I still really like 
him,” said Gupta. “Again, though, I’m 
worried about the experience issue: One 
year as senator, and he honestly hasn’t 
shown up to college meetings. He’s only 
started speaking up in the last bit of the 
year where elections are starting up.”

According to Condello, he collected 
a large amount of absences because of a 
class conflict. He added that he missed 
several more meetings because he was 
hospitalized due to a knee injury and 
respiratory distress from mono.

Last Friday, Condello did not attend 
the noontime A.S. presidential debate 
in Price Center Plaza. According to 
Condello, he didn’t attend the debate due 
to a migraine, a problem he’s had since 
he was a child.

As students vote on TritonLink this 
week, Condello said he plans to dive 
headfirst into his campaign, which was 
delayed by his recent recovery period 
from mono.

“It’s going to be a Blitzkrieg kind 
of campaign for [this] week,” Condello 
said. “[It’s] going to be a firestorm of me 
advertising.”

If elected, Condello said that, though 
his brutal honesty may make some 
uncomfortable, protecting his ideals and 
the interests of students will come first.  

“Ultimately, I care more about the 
right thing than about making people 
like me happy,” Condello said. “That’s 
why I can never be a professional politi-
cian — because I’d piss [off] too many 
people.”

According to Ben Hassine, her big-
gest priority as president would be to 
institutionalize student activism.

“I feel like activism, the word, [is 
taken] to mean somebody holding a pole 
or flier or something — but that’s not 
what it means to me,” she said. “It just 
means doing something with a purpose.”

For the candidates on Students First 
— the slate Ben Hassine created this year 
— this “purpose” is achieving access and 
affordability at UCSD.

“Usually, it’s always this fringe group 
of people that are protesting, that are 
talking to legislators,” Ben Hassine said. 
“Every person has a different role, and 
I feel like students need to utilize that 
unique role to collectively work for a 
more affordable education.”

Ben Hassine also considers campus 
sustainability a number one priority, evi-
denced by her work with One Earth One 
Justice — which brought Fair Trade on 
campus and made steps toward taking 
the UCSD Bookstore sweatshop-free by 
convincing administrators to discontinue 
the sale of Russell sportswear.

Along with the habit of spreading 
herself too thin, councilmembers have 
said Ben Hassine has a tendency to rep-

resent and advocate for specific groups 
and issues — a potential detriment to 
representing the student body as a whole.

“Being opinionated is her hardest 
shortfall,” Vice President of Student Life 
Ricsie Hernandez said. “She doesn’t take 
time to talk to other people about their 
views. Being opinionated about one 
thing is completely detrimental to the 
whole student population.” 

Hernandez appointed Ben Hassine 
to the Housing and Dining Committee, 
and said she performed well there (Ben 
Hassine was the only committee member 
to vote against the recent hike in housing 
and dining fees). However, Hernandez 
said she doubts the senator’s ability to 
adapt to the much broader role and 
reach of A.S. president. 

“I think there are better choices for 
president who have good attendance 
records and are open to all ideas, and 
could represent the entire student popu-
lation instead of focusing on specific 
groups,” Hernandez said.

UCSD College Democrats President 
Victor Lin — who worked with Ben 
Hassine on the CDAC — disagreed.

“She’s an all-campus senator,” Lin 
said. “And take a look at her work on the 
[CDAC] — that affects all students. … 
It’s good to see someone so passionate 
about non-trivial things. It’s refreshing.”

Ben Hassine stressed that her broad 
focus on access, affordability and sustain-
ability does not mean she will ignore the 
more lighthearted aspects of student life.

“I want to personally assure everyone 
that I love to party and that I really, really 
do support student life on this campus, 

and I do think it is the one answer to 
healing UCSD after all that happened 
with the protests and whatnot — bring-
ing everyone together regardless of race 
or ethnicity,” Ben Hassine said. “Even 
if maybe I focus on the budget cuts too 
much or whatever, I feel that it’s well-
placed because it’s about time students 
are aware of these issues, and it’s about 
time they also spend their money sus-
tainably.” 

Ben Hassine has been especially 
vocal about her opposition to pursuing 
a football team — one of current A.S. 
President Utsav Gupta’s key campaign 
promises.

“I understand football is cool, but it 
costs $1.5 million just to get it started,” 
Ben Hassine said. “Do you know what 
we could do with $1.5 million for our 
students other than just a football team? 
It’s not responsible to propose that right 
now.”

Ben Hassine defended her view of 
UCSD students as “global citizens.”

“I always hear things like, ‘Oh, you 
have an external edge,’ or, ‘You focus so 
much on the VP of External Affairs,’ or, 
‘You care too much about people outside 
of UCSD, so you can’t work for UCSD 
students,’” Ben Hassine said. “But I feel 
like, as A.S. president, I would need 
to work for students at UCSD but not 
negatively affect the world around us. 
We can’t be completely ignorant of the 
outside world. We can’t. It’s completely 
irresponsible. We have such privilege to 
be here.”

The A.S. Presidency, Gupta says, can 
be time-devouring — consuming any-
where from “30 hours on a good week 
to 80 hours a week on a bad week” — it’s 
something he’s worked his entire senior 
year to make the most of. 

Though Gupta has been criticized 
by his fellow candidates for proposing to 
start a football team funded by student 
fees, he believes that the student body 
should be able to vote on the matter.

“He stuck to his promises — he has 
a large staff, he created a committee to 
look into all his campaign promises,” said 

AVP of Student Organizations Andrew 
Ang. “But I believe that they were start-
ed, and not fully completed in the term 
he said they would be completed in.”

The way Gupta sees it, aiming high 
shouldn’t be something candidates avoid.

“I think an advantage I’ve had is I’ve 
been able to specifically state what I want 
to do — I think it was something that 
differentiated me last year,” Gupta said. 
“My platforms have always been very 
ambitious and I think it was my largest 
criticism levied against me, but I think a 
lot of it can be achieved.”

Much of the reason Gupta has con-

crete ways to accomplish things, is due to 
his knowledge of the bureaucracy within 
A.S. Council and the administration, said 
VP Finance and friend Peter Benesch.

“Even if you ignore the fact that he 
was A.S. president for the last year, he 
literally has knowledge that no other 
candidate does — absolutely no other 
candidate,” Benesch said. “If you ask any 
other candidate, ‘How do you do x?’ 
They might give you an answer but it’ll 
probably be B.S. because, in all honesty, 
knowing how to do things is the most 
crucial thing to being a president in stu-
dent government.”

So, looking for a fresh (and hopefully more 
popular) pitch, McEuen talked with friend and 
Associate Vice President of Student Orgs Andrew 
Ang about creating the Tritons First slate. From 
there, they started recruiting running mates. 

“We started picking people — what I think is 
the best of the best,” McEuen said. “Everyone on 
our slate has experience. They are not just random 
people who want to get involved.”

Even if he doesn’t win the presidential race this 
year, McEuen said he believes the Tritons First slate 
— his “biggest accomplishment” — will live on.

Indeed, McEuen runs the party like a machine: 
Every last campuswide senator recites the “Create! 
Empower! Restore!” catchphrase like it was mentally 
programmed, and it’s hard to traverse Library Walk 
without stumbling over a shiny Tritons First flier.

“I hope it’s not just a flash in the pan,” he said. 
“It’s supposed to be a lot more than that.”

Eleanor Roosevelt College Senior and fel-
low Lambda Chi Alpha member Dan Driver said 
McEuen is “a breath of fresh air.” 

 “Brian always has a smile on his face, and is a 
good person to look to when you need a calm and 
levelheaded point of view,” Driver said. 

McEuen said this affinity toward creating togeth-
erness is what sets him apart from current A.S. 
President Gupta, who is running for a second term.

“Utsav is a very smart person,” McEuen said. “I 
would bet my bottom dollar that he knows more 
about the rest of this campus than the rest of the 
student body. But he hasn’t really brought the coun-
cil together at all, and that’s one of the main things I 
want to work on.” 

McEuen said his ability to facilitate constructive 
conversation — something the current president has 
not proven to be his strong point — is one of the 

most important attributes of an executive in chief.
“The president might not have the best ideas, 

but he needs to be the best at getting people to come 
forward with those ideas,” he said.

Even independent candidate Condello recog-
nized McEuen as one of the council’s most reliable 
mediators. Condello, who has a reputation for being 
confrontational during meetings, has expressed 
interest in appointing McEuen as his chief of staff, if 
elected, as a voice in his ear to keep him “in check.”

In response to McEuen’s candidacy, Gupta said 
he’s worried that McEuen has almost no track record 
of personal accomplishments on council.

“The main thing that worries me about [Brian] 
is that he hasn’t actually accomplished any projects 
over the two years that he’s been on A.S. — aside 
from the collaborative things like the A.S. referen-
dum,” Gupta said. “But I can’t really tell you what 
he’s done throughout the year or what he stands for.”

Another one of McEuen’s main priorities, if 
elected, is to rein in A.S. spending.

“My biggest problem with the way A.S. is run, 
for the two years I’ve been on council, is that they 
waste money,” McEuen said. He said he will urge 
councilmembers to pay more attention to where 
their money’s going, and recruit more moneymak-
ing events like concerts on campus and ultimately 
lower council dependence on student activity fees.

McEuen said he is also dissatisfied with the red 
tape involved in the process by which A.S. senators 
request A.S. funding for their individual projects.

“We have to beg council on our hands and 
knees,” McEuen said. “The way that the budget’s 
drafted — the way our system works right now — 
there are so many loops you have to jump through 
to get money. That shouldn’t be the case. It’s the 
students’ money, not A.S.’s money.”

Although he is a self-proclaimed Arizona 
Cardinals fan, McEuen’s stance on a potential UCSD 
football team aligns with his conservative views 
on spending (It’s a talking point that aligns almost 
identically with that of presidential candidate Wafa 
Ben Hassine, leader of Students First, the election’s 
only other large slate. )

“It’s a little bit of an insult to injury if we are 
asking our students to pay for a football team when 
students already have to leave the school because 
they can’t pay for an education,” McEuen said.

McEuen has called his exit from the UCSD vol-
leyball team a “blessing in disguise.” Still, his intense 
involvement with the A.S. Council can sometimes 
become a strain alongside academics, he said.

“I wasn’t super involved in high school, so it’s 
hard for me to balance everything,” McEuen said. 
“It’s a challenge I still face.”

Anderson’s time is among the top 
in Division-II this year, and he said 
he hopes he can push through to first 
place at the conference and national 
championships.

“My ultimate goal is to win nation-
als,” he said. “I haven’t taken a confer-
ence title yet, and that’s something I’d 
really like to do.”

The Cal/Nevada meet was an over-
all success for the Tritons: The women 
placed sixth and the men 10th, against 
some of the top programs on the West 
Coast. UCSD had the top Division-II 
squad for both men and women.

Most of the team will head to the 
highly competitive Pomona-Pitzer 
Invitational on April 10, although 
some runners will head to the UCLA 
Rafer Johnson/Jackie Joyner-Kersee 
Invitational on the same day.

TRACK AND FIELD — Right in the thick of 
season play, the Tritons got the a perfect chance 
to test their depth and flexibility: a small, friendly 
invite close to home.

UCSD track and field competed in the second 
annual Mangrum Invitational on April 3, turn-
ing in some impressive results at the non-scoring 
meet, which was held at Cal State San Marcos. 
No team scores were kept, allowing the Tritons to 
train in events that were not necessarily their best.

The meet was a welcome reprieve after the 
team’s outstanding performance at the high profile 
Cal/Nevada Championships the week before.

“It’s a great opportunity for us to rest people or 
move them around as we need to,” said women’s 
coach Darcy Ahner. “It allows us to qualify more 
people in the relay events, and it can give people a 
chance to try more events as well.”

Several nearby universities showed up to the 
meet — including the University of Southern 
California and UC Irvine — but none of the 
Tritons’ conference opponents participated. This 
gave UCSD a chance to experiment a little and 
fine tune for bigger meets later in the season.

On the women’s side, junior Kelly Fogarty blew 
by the competition in the 100-meter dash to clock 
a time of 11.90 seconds. The school-record holder 
also anchored the Tritons’ winning 4x100-meter 
relay team. 

“Kelly has had so much fire this year, and its 
been really fun to watch,” Ahner said.

Senior Linda Rainwater won three events, 
recording the top marks in the shot put, javelin 
throw and high jump. A former All-American 
in the heptathlon, Rainwater will look to build 
on her success in the field events at the Mt. Sac 
heptathlon in Azusa on April 14. 

The men’s team was lead by Fred Cook: The 
senior shot putter hit 52’ 2” to win the event and 
record a provisional NCAA  Division-II champi-
onships qualifier. Senior Daniel Anderson turned 
in a similarly magnificent performance, breaking 
four minutes in his first attempt at 1500 meters 
with a time of 3:54.40. He earned second place in 
the event, only a week after he broke a 17-year-old 
school record in the 800-meter race. Anderson 
recorded a time of 1:51.12 seconds in the pre-
liminaries of the Cal/Nevada Championships, and 
bested Mark Yuen’s 1993 record by 0.14 seconds. 

“That meant a lot to me,” Anderson said. “I’ve 
been dealing with injuries and I haven’t really had 
a strong healthy season in a while, so I’ve been 
waiting to break that record for a long time.”

Head Coach Tony Salerno emphasized the 
significance of Anderson’s performance.

“The record is a big one,” Salerno said. “We’re 
really happy to see him show that kind of talent.”

With less than a month left in their regu-
lar season, the Tritons held tight against Cal 
State San Bernardino and Brown University 
on April 4. And the No. 17 UCSD women’s 
water-polo team could not have picked a better 
juncture of the season to hit their stride.

Senior utility Stephanie Heinrich scored 
five goals and sophomore two-meter Kirsten 
Bates added two more, earning the team its 
sixth consecutive victory: a 11-7 win over No. 
20 Brown University. Heinrich had also put 
in the go-ahead goal earlier in the day against 
San Bernardino, helping the Tritons to a 6-3 
victory. 

Heinrich scored four goals in the first four 
minutes of the game, and Brown was never 
able to recover.

“Stephanie Heinrich set the tone immedi-
ately as the senior team captain,” head coach 
Brad Kreutzkamp said. “Four goals on four 
shots to start the game let everyone know that 
she meant business — and that attitude carries 
over to the rest of the team.”

UCSD led by as many as six goals in the 

third period, but Brown netted three straight 
goals in the fourth to cut the Triton lead to 
10-7 with six minutes remaining. However, 
the Triton defenders would not allow any-
thing past them for the rest of the game, and 
Bates added her second goal with 36 seconds 
remaining as the Tritons held on for the win.

Seniors Sarah Glick and Lauren Presant led 
Brown with two goals apeice.

The Bears’ defeat leaves them at 18-7 over-
all for the season. 

Against San Bernardino, the Tritons fell 
behind 3-2 after the first period, but scored the 
final four goals of the match to seal the win. 

“Our theory all year long has been that 
any team can beat anybody on any day,” 
Kreutzkamp said. “That game was an example 
of how we can end on the wrong end of that. 
But, thankfully, our defense kept us in the 
game until our offense woke up in the fourth 
quarter.”

The Tritons were unable to score for 
nearly 20 minutes before junior utility TC 
Coles scored her first goal at UCSD to tie the 
game with 1:20 remaining in the third period. 
Heinrich then scored with 6:58 remaining, 
and Bates and junior attacker Hanalei Crowell 

added late insurance goals to finish off San 
Bernardino. 

Redshirt freshman Misty Vu scored two 
goals for the Coyotes, who dropped to 13-16 
on the season.

The Tritons have a busy weekend ahead of 
them in Northern California. The team will 
play Cal State East Bay on April 9, then com-
pete in the Santa Clara Invitational on April 10 
and April 11.

Softball Team Slides into April With Series Split Against Dominguez Hills
By Vishal Natarajan
Sports Editor

SOFTBALL — UCSD launched into a four-
game series against Cal State Dominguez Hills 
from April 2 to April 3, playing the best ball 
they’ve played all season — and possibly in 
program history.

The Tritons got April off to a good start, 
fresh out of an equally successful March that 
saw the team win 15 of their 18 games and 
rocket to third place in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association.

Moreover, the team’s 23-11 March record 
marked the best start to a season in the pro-
gram’s short history at the Division-II level. The 
Tritons achieved a 29-13 finish in 2000 during 
their final season competing in Division-III.

“We showed what were capable of, and what 
we expect to be doing,” senior captain Nicole 
Saari said. “We finally started hitting toward the 
end of the year. The end of the lineup started 
getting it together.”

Despite their superior NCAA regional rank-
ing, however, the No. 4 Tritons were only able to 
manage a series split against the No. 10 ranked 
Toros — sharing the spoils in both Friday’s and 

Saturday’s doubleheaders.
On Friday, the Tritons picked up right where 

they left off last month, pummeling the Toros 
7-0 behind a career performance from sopho-
more right-handed pitcher Camille Gaito.

Gaito was stingy on the mound for her 12th 
win of the season, striking out a personal best 
of nine Toro hitters. She allowed only two hits 
and walked none.

Gaito received ample run support from a 
fiery Triton lineup that poured in seven runs 
from 10 hits. Freshman infielder Katie Belanger 
launched a three-run shot to left field in the 
fifth inning to seal the UCSD win, and finished 
the game two-for-three at the plate with four 
runs-batted-in and one run scored.

In their second game, however, sloppy 
Triton defense allowed the Toros to mount a 
lopsided lead. The opposition capitalized on 
five Triton errors for a 9-1 victory to even the 
series.

Saturday’s play followed a similar pattern. In 
game three of the series, UCSD earned a hard-
fought 4-2 victory over Dominguez Hills before 
losing 10-1 in the series finale.

In Saturday’s first game, Gaito was again 
dominant, throwing a complete game six-hitter 

and allowing only two earned runs while strik-
ing out two. The performance improved her 
personal season record to 13-6.

For the second straight day, Belanger pro-
vided the big hits for the Triton offense. Her 
three-run homerun in the fifth inning broke a 
1-1 tie, giving th team a 4-1 lead it would not 
relinquish.

However, in the series finale, the Toro 
offense rebounded from their Gaito beatdown 
to tag two Triton pitchers — senior Christine 
Zankich and sophomore Tess Granath — for 
nine runs in the first three innings, coming out 
with a 10-1 victory.

The Tritons, still in third place after the 
series split, now sit at 25-13 overall and 15-9 
in conference, with three league series remain-
ing. They return to action on the road against 
Humboldt State on March 9.

“We can’t take them lightly,” Saari said. “We 
know every team in our conference is capable 
of winning any given game, so we need to come 
out strong — play like we did in the first games 
of our last series.”
