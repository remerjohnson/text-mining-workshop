Discrepancy Discovered In Revelle 
Engineering Major Requirements 
By RANDY DOTINGA 
Senior SiujJWriter 

Revelle College regulations, 
which define a major as consisting 
of 18 upper-division classes, were 
discovered to be in direct conflict 
with engineering degree require-
ments. 

upper-division classes. 
Revelle Provost Thomas Bond 

said the class requirements of some 
engineering majors were increased 
by the Academic Senate about 
seven years ago, so the majors could 
be accredited by the Accreditation 
Board for Engineering and Tech-
nology. 

Lynn Harris, administrator of 
~e Academic Senate, which ap-
proves both departmental and col-
lege major requirements, agreed 
that the ~epartmental requirements 
supersede those of Revelle Col-
lege, in regard to majors.

'Fi&htjn& Words' 
Procedures Outlined; 
Faculty Untouched 
By JEFFREY YAMAGUCHI 
Contrihwing Writer 

Although the procedure for 
analyzing complaints of verbal 
harassment has been established, 
there is no set standard for differ-
entiating between 'fighting words ' 
and free speech. 

The new 'fighting words' pol-
icy, a part of the UC Student Con-
duct Policy adopted by UC Presi-
dent David P. Gardner, allows the 
administration to discipline UC 
students who verbally har-
ass others. 

'Fighting words,' are, 
according to the policy, 
"personally abusive epi-
thets. Such words include, 
but are not limited to, those terms 
widely recognized to be deroga-
tory references to race, ethnkity, 
religion, sex, sexual orientation. 
disability, and other personal char-
acteristics ... 

According to Student Conduct 
Coordinator Nick Aguilar, "This 
is a new area of the law. [The 
UCSD administrators] don't have 
any clear guidance as to what the 
standards are" when considering if 
something is free speech or harass-
ment, Aguilar said. 

According to the policy, in order 
for these "personally abusive epi-
thets" to be considered 'fighting 
words,' they must be directly ad-
dressed to "any ordinary person" 
in a context "likely to provoke a 
violent reaction, whether or not 

they actually do so." 
"These elements need to be 

present to satisfy the definition of 
a ' fighting word, ' " Aguilar said. 

However, Aguilar was unsure 
what the policy means by an "ordi-
nary person." 

Aguilar, in his capacity as tu-
dent conduct coordinator. would 
be the first to analyze the validity 
of a 'fighting words' complaint if 
one were filed . 

"First, it would have to be de-
termined that there was a presence 

of 'fighting words,' " 
Aguilar aid. 

"When the circum-
stances of their utterance 
create a hostile and in-
timidating environment 

which ... will interfere with the 
victim's ability to pursue his or her 
education," the words would be 
construed as harrasmenl and a com-
plaint would be valid, Aguilar said. 

If Aguilar finds that acomplaint 
is valid, and that a violation of the 
policy has occured, he will for-
ward the complaint to the 
offender' college dean. The dean 
will then investigate the matter fur-
ther in order to determine if there is 
sufficient evidence to ju tify charg-
ing the tudent with a violation, 
Aguilar aid. 

If a student is found guilty of a 
violation, the dean will attempt to 
informally resolve the matter by 
imposing a punishment. 

Fonner A.S. Student Advocate 
Bard-Alan Finlan said he noticed 
the discrepancy last spring in the 
Academic Senate's list of gradu-
ation requirements at Revelle Col-
lege. 

However, according to Bond, 
the Revelle graduation requirement 
was not changed at the time. 

He added that departmental 
major requirements hold prece-
dence over those of Revelle Col-
lege. 

UC Regents Search For 
1990-91 Student Regent 

"If the student disagrees with 
either the punishment or with the 
allegation, the student is always 
entitled to a hearing by a judicial 
board," Aguilar said. 

"The judicial boards are the final 
determiners of innocence or guilt, II 
he added. 

"I'm a Revelle student, and I 
was looking through [the require-
ments] and I thought it was kind of 
funny," Finlan said. 

A section of the Academic 
Senate manual states that majors at 
Revelle College cannot consist of 
more than 18 upper-division 
classes. 

Several majors in the division 
of engineering, consisting of the 
applied mechanics and engineer-
ing sciences (AMES), electrical 
and computer engineering (ECE) 
and computer science and engi-
neering (CSE) departments, require 
more than 18 upper-<livisonc\asses. 
For example, the UCSD General 
Catalog states that the AMES 
department's systems and control 
engineering major consists of 22

"I don't think there really is an 
issue here. It's like having a state 
law that is inconsistent with a fed-
eral law. Clearly the federal law 
takes precedence," Bond said. 

He added that, although the dis-
crepancy "needs to be cleared 
up ... I've never had a student 
complain about it. 

"If we were to insist thatelectri-
cal engineers in Revelle College 
only take 18 courses, we would 
have to reinstitute [an unaccredited] 
bachelor of arts degree. The de-
partment doesn't want to offer it, 
and the students don't want it. 
Students want an accredited de-
gree, and they ' re willing to 
take ... more classes to get it," he 
aid. 

OPINION 

The UC Board of Regents is 
accepting applications for the po-
sition of 1990-91 student regent. 

The student regent is a full-
voting member of the UC Board of 
Regents, and is selected annually 
out of applicants from all nine 
University of California schools. 

The tenn of the office runs from 
July I, 1990 through July 1,199\. 

Since 1974, one student from 
the entire UC system has been se-
lected each year to represent all 
UC students. 

The UC Board of Regents ap-
points the student after a three-
month selection process. 

The current student regent is 
Guillermo Rodriguez, Jr., a UC 
Berkeley senior majoring in soci-
ology and mass communications. 
Rodriguez, who speaks both Eng-
lish and Spanish fluently, ha also

Applications for the office of 
UC student regent are available at 
the following locations: the 
ASUCSD office on the third floor 
of the Price Center, EDNA, all 
college deans' offices, the Office 
of Graduate Studies and Research,

on Friday in the chancellor's of-
fice. 

Dan Watkins of the UCLA Daily 
Bruin contributed to the writing of 
this article. 

According to Aguilar, faculty 
members are not subject to scru-
tiny under this policy. However, 
they can file a complaint against a 
student if they feel they have been 
verbally harra sed. 

Although there is a faculty code 
of conduct, Special A sistant to 
the Chairperson ofUC's Academic 
Senate David Krogh aid that such 
words covered in the student pol-
icy are not included in the faculty 
code. 

"There is no provision ... that 
would prohibit faculty members 
from using any explicit set of words 
. ... There i no 'fighting word. ' 
counterpart in the faculty code of 
conduct. II said Krogh. 

Krogh added that there has been 
no discussion concerning the im-
plementation of a' fighting words'

Minority Admissions Criteria 
Addressed at UCLA Campus 

Students protesting a proposed admissions policy 
which threatens guaranteed minority admissions met 
with UCLA's Vice Chancellor of Academic Affairs 
Thomas Litka last week to discuss their concerns. 

The students recently organized the Affinnative Action 
Task Force to oppose a policy which eliminates "protec-
tive pool .. - a previous admissions policy guaranteeing 
underrepresented minority groups admission into the 
UC y tem. 

Litka said that, under the new policy, 40 to 60 percent 
of incoming students at UCLA's School of Letters and 
Science will be accepted next year based on academic 
excellence alone. 

The remaining UC-eligible students will be selected 
on the basis of supplementary criteria that have not yet 
been determined, he said. 

However, members of the task force are concemed 
about the new system because UCLA Chancellor 
Charles Young never informed them of the changes, and 
fear that underrepresented minorities would be unable to 
compete in the new criteria. 

But, because the admissions committee was going to 
consider both academic and supplementary criteria for 
all students in one entire class, that means that all UC-
eligible students are not going to be admitted just on the 
basis of their race, Lifka said. 

No changes to the plan can be made until the issue is 
discussed at an open forum Nov. 7.

UCSB Names Vice Chancellor 
Of Academic Affairs 

UCSB's 18-month search for a vice chancellor of 
student affairs ended last week as UCSB Chancellor 
Barbara Uehling announced the appointment of Michael 
D. Young to fill the top university link between students 
and the administration. 

Young, the associate dean and registrar at Wesleyan 
University in Middletown, Connecticut, was selected 
after two national searches and will become the highest 
ranking black administrator on campus when he as-
sumes the post Jan. I , 1990. His appointment to the 
position, with a $90,000 annual salary, will likely be 
approved by the UC Board of Regents at their Nov. 16-
17 meeting. 

Young will oversee all student affairs, fonnerly called 
student services, including admissions, registration, 
student govemment, campus safety, residential life, the 
Educational Opportunity Program, the Student Health 
Center and financial aid. 

An administrator since 1978 at Wesleyan, a liberal 
arts college with a student population of 2,655, Young

Biologist Gould Speaks On Evolution 
By DONNA CHIN 
Guardian Intern 

Award-winning evolutionary 
biologist and author Stephen' Jay 
Gould discussed the possibility that 
popular theories of evolution might 
be incorrect in a Monday lecture at 
UCSD. 

Discussing his new book WOII-
derful Life: The Burgess Shale and 
the Nature of History, Gould pro-
posed a non-conventional theory 
of evolution based on evidence 
found in a shale fonnation con-
taining the fossils of creatures 
which Ii ved over 530 million years 
ago. The formation, known as the 
Burgess Shale, is located in British 
Columbia. 

The accepted model of evolu-
tion, known as the Cone of In-
creasing Diversity, states that, 
through natural selection, many 
species evolved from a few simple 
ancestors. 

Disputing that theory, Gould 
showed support for a model "char-
acterized by decimation and diver-
sification." He calls the model the 
Inverted Tree theory. 

According to Gould, the Bur-
gess fossils represent a plethora of 
life fonns, 90 percent of which 
became ex tinct. Some of the crea-
tures that perished included one 
with five e'yes, another with a 
vacuum cleaner-shaped nose, and 
another with a row of legs on its 
back, he said. 

element of random chance. ]f the 
tape of life were to be replayed, it 
would be played back in a different 
manner . .. others that perished 
might survive," he explained. 

Because any slight change could 
have altered the course of history 
and caused one of the creatures 
found there to remain alive to this 
day, Gould said it wasn't neces-
sary to explain the existence of 
every creature found in the Bur-

gess Shale. 
"Who knows why? [Each crea-

ture) is what it is," he said. 
In closing, Gould pointed out 

the Pikaia, a Burgess creature, is in 
the Chordata phylum, the same 
phylum as homo sapiens. Gould 
suggested that the Pikaia is a pos-
sible ancestor of human beings. 

" Decimate [the Pikaia) in a 
different way , and we 're not here," 
Gould said, 

"There is no explanation why

A.S. Elections 

It's Time to Change 
It may seem a little odd to be talking about the Associated 

Student elections so early in the year. Elections are held the 
second week of spring quarter, and it's only October. 

But the election process needs a lot of work, and it's going to 
take months to work out all the problems - if the AS. is going 
to make the changes, they should stan now. A repeat of last year's 
travesty would be shameful. 

The first and most important change would be to lengthen the 
campaign period. Candidates have just a week to get their mes-
sages out, and voters are unable to really get to know the 
candidates. 

A political campaign is really a living creature. Its flexes and 
motions give voters a special insight into the candidate. For 
example, George Bush's primary campaign, and its destruction 
of Robert Dole, gave voters the first clue that Bush was not going 
to be an easy opponent. 

His tight control of hi s staff, which only wavered during the 
time between the last primary and the Republican convention, 
was in sharp contrast to Dole's disarray, and Dukakis ' early staff 
problems. 

Watching a campaign may not give voters an exact image of 
how a politician will govern, but it is the only insight they have. 
In the A.S . e lections, campaign watching is virtually impossible: 
campaigns flash by so fast that the real details are difficult to 
distinguish. 

Moreover, the campaigns largely become a struggle for name 
recognition. The issues become secondary to anempting to make 
voters stand in the ballot box and think, "Hmm, that name seems 
familiar. .. I think I'll votefor that person ." It's no wonder voter 
turnout is so low. 

A longer campaign would allow debates to be organized, 
speeches to be staged, and would allow the voters to really have 
a clear picture of each candidate in their minds. This is the only 
way voters can make informed decisions. 

Another problem with the campaign is the inconsistency of 
rules from college to college. Candidates have to struggle with 
rules governing such things as posting flyers and direct cam-
paigning, and they simply don 't have time to really learn all of the 
rules. The AS. should urge colleges to make their rules uniform. 

The last problem is with campaign violations. With all of the 
other problems, it isn't suprising that candidates, either through 
lack of ethics or simple ignorance, often violate campaign laws. 
But last year, the A.S. Judicial Board's decision to award Mishka 
Migacz the office of vice president external, despite its having 
found her guilty of violating election bylaws, sent a signal: if you 
violate the rules, you might still get into office - if you can get 
enough votes on the board . 

This is inherently undemocratic. The AS. Judic ial Board 
should only overrule the Election Committee if the ca e is truly 
egregious. [fit does not, the Election Committee's decisions will 
lack authority, and the election process will deteriorate further. 

Julia Ramirez, last year's election commisioner, was angered 
by the Judicial Board's action last year. She pointed out, sensibly, 
that if the election bylaws are to have any meaning, they must be 
strictly enforced. 

But if they are to be enforced, they must be sensible and clear, 
and candidates must have time to design campaigns which 
follow all of the rules . Moreover, if campaign were longer, 
closer supervision would be possi ble, and election violations 
would be less common. The accusations of election violations 
which fly after each e lection further undermine the e lec tion 
proce s. 

The A.S. Counci l mu~t begin debating the!>e i::.::.ues ::.oon, and 
work to rev ise the election bylaws . If student government i!> to 
be taken seriously, tudents must feel their voice really counts. A 
sensible, fair election process will accomplish this.

\. LETTERS j 
Taking Power From the Elite 
Editor: 

The approaches in both the 
editorial "Racism and Inequity" 
and Patty Jellie's commentary 
"Sexist Language and Dinosaurs" 
(Guardian, Ocl. 23) are similar in 
their lack of depth and clarity, 
though more frivolous in the lat -
ter. 

is kept el ite. These elites make 
decisions in their self interest 
which equal access will change by 
reshaping the structure of social 
representation. 

Pauy Jenie also misse the 
point: power and ideology flow 
through language, through classi-
fication and nomenclature. Lan-
guage doesn't need to be neu-
tered; many women take pride in 
the words "she," "s ister" and 
"womao" because , to them, these 
are words of significance. 

However, some words denote 
categories (for instance, "fire-
man") which suggest that it is as 

natural for men to be involved in 
certain professions as it is for 
women 10 be housewives. Con-
sider, also, the term "school mis-
tress" (which, hopefully, is a di-
nosaur) that deempha izes teach-
ing, and compare it with the more 
profound (and male) "professor." 

Economic injustice has led 10 
forms of social and cultural domi-
nation. Everything has a context. 
Affirmative action is more than 
the quota system which the "lan-
guage" of the editorial implies. 
Instead of neutering language 
arbitrarily, it is forms of domina-
tion that must be revealed and 
degendered. 

Ishwar K. Puri 

"Raci m and Inequity" treats 
affirmative action as what it should 
not be: a quota sy tem. Affirma-
tive action seeks to redress his-
toric wrongs involving all sec-
tions of the populace, but the self-
centeredness of part of the "ma-
jority" creates the illusion that it is 
a "minority problem." 

In fact, affirmative action, as a 
concept, involves women and cer-
tainly should be extended to poor 
whites, so that those who have 
been deprived of their share are 
allowed and actively encouraged 
to establish their merit . 

An Imagination Exercise 

Affirmative action ha n ' t 
failed; it hasn't been allowed to 
flouri h. It isn't just a reservation 
of opportunity, but a push for 
communities, ethnic grou ps, 
women and the poor to involve 
themselves in the workplace and 
gain economic and political power 
through an adequate representa-
tion in that strata of society which

Guardian. 

The offensive ad features a 
woman in a bikini in a stereotypi-
cal pose, and advertises a 1990 
desk calendar called "A-Swim-
sui t-A-Day" (touted to "bring new 
excitement to the student desk"-
obviously only heterosexual males 
are thought of as "students" atthis 
universi ty). 

No doubt each page of the said 
calendar includes similarly mi-
sogynistic pictures. It is the height 

BENSON 

-, 

of hypocrisy for The Guardian to 
have a policy forbidding sexist 
language in its articles, but then to 
collude with the most explicit kind 
of sexism when money is involved 
(i.e., advertising revenues). And it 
won 't do to respond with a protest 
against "censorship." Would you 
accept advertisements that were 
blatantly racist? I suspect not. 

It's time that the Guardian 
editors started putting their money 
where their mouths are. Don't 
condone and reenact sexism by 
accepting such offensive adver-
tisements.

land. They work and they toil to 
keep things going for their dark-
sk inned masters and mistresses, 
and in the process they reproduce 
multitudes of children who are 
denied education or any form of 
equal opportunity. 

They reason they are denied 
these is simple; it 's because they 
have those small white faces, 
which do not in any way resemble 
what is familiar to their bosses. 

There is, however, an odd little 
knot in the system, which is, quite 
simply, an idea. This idea got 
written into the con titution by 
which the bosses lived - why, 
it 's hard to say. 

The idea had to do with liberty 
and all that followed from liberty. 
It was an idea that was constantly 
subverted, but was also constantly 
reasserting itself. In one historic 
moment after another, the idea 
took form - an emanc ipation pro-
calamation amazingly freed the 
white slaves who were still de-
spised, mind you, but were now at 
liberty. 

While they were promised a 
piece ofland and some help from

GUAimIAN Cl -up Singer Grace Slick said, "!tAli of them talk about how your life 
will be spectacular if you USl! some 
kind of chemical. Peter Pan: you

still show psychedelic trips as 
something fun , as in Charlie alld 
the Chocolate Factory. Charlie 
and his grandfather, basically the 
only decent people visiting the 
factory , both have a great time 
during the boat trip, while the other 
passengers just freak out. 

Charlie is a model child who 
simply enjoys a little psychedelia. 
Dr. Seuss uses magically enticing 
(not to menti on psychedelic) 
rhymes and pictures to qefend the 
environment, denounce selfish-
ness and attack the arms race.

Apology 
Editor: 

In my Editor's Box in the Oct. 
25 edition of Tile Koala , I lamented 
that A.S . Programming Com-
misioner Mall Schnurer doesn't 
showcase local bands. 

After talking to him and feel-
ing the heat of his rage, I want to 
mention that he saves the opening 
TG slots for local talent, even 
though sometimes they eschew 
payment for the opportunity to 
perform for a large, monied crowd. 

I was misinformed and deserve 
to be slapped around. You may 
begin.

movies shown to children make 
me wonder if there is much dis-
tinction between the two. The 
passage above is an excerpt from 
Charlie and Ihe Chocolale Fac-
tory. 

The irony of the situation is 
that the same parent s who so 
vehement ly condemn drug use are 
feeding children stories that sup-
port it (although in a subtle man-
ner). 

Surprising? How about the 
surreal imagery of Alice in Won-
derland, the Wi:ard o/Oz, or Dr. 
Seuss' books? These are all 
children's stories filled stock-full 
with psychedelia. 

Some books and movies that 
don't actually deal with the con-
sumption of foreign substances

There truly appears to be a pro-
hallucinogenic trend in children 's 
stories. Nevertheles , it is ex-
pres ed with a great deal of sub-
tlety and artistry. Compare this 
with the "just say no" campaign. 
Which would children rather pay 
attention to? 

Funhermore, these messages 
to children aren't necessarily bad. 

Our society is not harmed so 
much by marijuana and hallucino-
gens as it is by the militant, right-
eous anger of the govemment's 
"drug war." 

Halluc inogens are responsible

Earthquake 
Preparations 
Editor: 

When 1 was little, my mom al-
ways used to keep a bottle of water 
and some canned food around in 
case of an earthquake. My sister 
and I a lways laughed and said, 
"Mom, if there is ever a bad earth-
quake we're all going to die, so 
why bother?" After living in 
Oakland for 15 yea rs, I'm g lad J 
wasn't there last week, but Mom 
was right. 

My roommate's brother Jives 
in the donns at UC Santa Cruz. 
After the quake, he wa given a 
bottle of water and some Cheerios 
to eat. One box of Cheerios 
wouldn't last for long. 

There's no need to live in fear 
of a disaster, but it's well worth a 
little effort to plan ahead. Anyone 
who's lived in California has 
probably heard all this before, but 
for those who haven't : keep 
enough canned food and bottled 
water to last several days in an 
accessible place (don ' t forget to 
put a can opener with it), and find 
out where the nearest fire extin-
guisher is. If you live in a home. 
get a fire extinguisher and also 
find your gas shut-off switch in 
case ofa leak. It's also a good idea 
to keep a flashlight with your 
supplies and extra batteries for 
both the light and any radio you 
have. 

This time, don't just read this. 
Take a few minutes and do it. Last 
week the quake hit the Bay Area. 
It could be our tum next.

Imagination 
Continued from page 4 

the government in getting 
re-established, they never 
did see that promise fu l-
filled . 

Meanwhile, other dark-
skinned people arrived in 
droves and were given land 
and money to develop fanns 
across the nation. And the 
white folks , fending for 
themselves, didn 't do too 
well. 

After all , they were pen-
niless and despised simul-
taneously. And ifit weren't 
for that one idea, which 
could also be called "spirit ," 
hidden in the constitution, 
they would be utterly lost. 

That spirit kept reassert-
ing itself as a voting rights 
act, as an equal rights act, as 
something called affinna-
tive action, which meant a 
few spaces were reserved 
for those white people on 
the campuses and in work 
forces. 

But time and again, the 
dark people tried to kill it, 
saying it wasn't fair. They 
used, ironically, the exact 
same idea - the idea of lib-
erty - agai nst the pale faces, 
saying things like, " Pro-
grams which discriminate 
on the basis of skin color 
must be eliminated." 

Can you imagine?

damaging than alcohol or tobacco 
(to the best of my knowledge). 

The portrayal of these drugs in 
a positive light is not limited to 
children's stories. A very popular, 
award-winning movie called 
"Platoon" portrays marijuana 
positively. 

Virtually all oflhe "good" char-
acters in the movie are marijuana 
smokers. All the "bad" characte rs 
don 't smoke marijuana, and in 
some cases condemn it. I can't 
beli eve that thi s happened by 
chance. 

If all this proves anyth ing. it 's 
that marijuana and hallucinogenic 
substance are being used by a lot 
more intelligent, educated, and 
arti tic people than the govern-
ment would like to admit. What is 
our government afraid of?

AA CoecIlnnertube WOferpolo 

This week's Zips Team of the Week is into valve stems. What's 
that you say? Your don't know what a valve stem is? It is one of 
the most-i mportanr parts of one of our most popular sports. In 
order, it is a part of a innertube used in Innertubc Waterpolo. 

So these dudes and dudettes really know what to do when it 
comes ro innertubc waterpolo. Win games and keep the valvc 
stem away from vital parts. Goldilocks definitely is not afraid of 
the big bad wolf. In faa they arc undefeated and nor afraid of 
anyone. 

Led by Tris Martin and Cory Hind they defeated the unbeaten 
tcam Tubeless Bur Potent 12-5. It was total domination by a 
totally rad tcam.

High Pre 

• Story by Grace Lee, Guardian Intern 
Whether it be caused by studying for mid-

terms, writing paper.., relationships, jobs, or a 
combination of a little bit of everything, stress 
comes along as pan of the package for most stu-
dents . 

What distinguishes "normal" ,tress from more 
severe cases. in which some people are driven to 
the extreme point of suicide? 

For ,orne studellls, stress overload causes life 
to become an all-encompassing darkness without 
any apparent openings for i!Y1provement. 

Many people commit suicide because "one 's 
life appears to be unbearable, and they can't think 
of any alternatives ... to solving their problems," 
said clinical director of UCSD Psychological 
Services Dr. Rick Whitehill . 

"Stress i. something that appears to increase 
the [student' I pain level. or the problems, or 
both," Whitehill said. 

UCSD clinical psychologist Kathy Kashima. 
said that in a university setting, students are 
placed in a high pressure, evaluative situation. 
She also said that some students may feel the 
overwhelming burden that letter grades are a 
direct evaluation of their self worth. 

However. "academic stress itself, in a vacuum, 
is nOl a precipitator ... of suicide. There would 
have to be other factors or predispositions," 
Whitehill said. 

"UCSD, contrary to ... popular mythology, 
doe not have a high suicide rate," he said. 

Whitehill believes suicide rates at universities 

chool Go Hand-In-Hand 
may be slightly lower than in the general popula-
tion because most university students here are 
"relatively bright and adaptive. and even if they 
'Ire In major discomfort, they generally eek out al-
ternative, other than suicide." 

"When 1 start to stress, everything starts to 
snowball ... I think of the worst imaginable con-
sequences, and 1 feel like I'm no longer in con-
troL" one st udent, who asked not to be indentified, 

said. 
Psychologists say people experience difficulty 

eliminating stre s and, as problems grow worse, 
many are unable to pinpoint which factors contrib-
ute to their pain. 

An alternative for students may be to tum to 
peer groups or professional psychological services. 
Students are encouraged by UCSD Psychological 
Services to take advantage of free coun~eling serv-
ices and various workshops offered on campus. 

Kaishima offers workshops in stress manage-
ment so that students may learn skills in areas such 
as time management, assertiveness and relaxation 
to help reduce tress. 

"Stress is not just defined as an event in our 
life, but i a combination of things including what 

we're thinking, what we're feeling, what we do, 
and what goes on in our bodies," she said. 

Through stress workshops, students learn that 
individual perception of stress differs, and learn 
how they themselves respond to stress, Kashima 
said. 

Stress occurs "typically when the demands are 
greater than what we can meet." Kashima said. 

Through workshops and counseling. students 
examine what actions may contribute to stress and 
"what kind 'of things we start to think when we' re 
st ressed and whether or not the e thoughts are ac-
curate," Kashima added. 

"J've considered going to psychological 
service, but I'm worried aQout what other people 
would think. I know I don't have any serious 
problems, but I'd like to talk to someone to make 
things more clear," the student, who asked not to 
be indentified. said. 

Psychological Services stresses that one does 
not need to be suicidal to seek support or to learn 
how to cope with stress, The office's view is that 
some students are better equipped to deal with 
stress than others, while some get into unusual 
situations which cause a great amount of stress. 
However. Psychological Services said anyone can 
benefit from suppon services. 

The purpo es of work hops and Psychological 
Services are to provide students with support and a 
set of skills so that they may be able to cope with 
the demands that they are experiencing. and to 
make students aware that stress is something they 
can actually learn to manage, Kaishima said.

Continued from page 20 
only score in the first half. 

Approximately 30minutes into 
both halves, UCSD Head Coach 
Brian McManus made numerous 
substitutions. The changing of the 
guard still did not make it any eas-
ier for Claremont, however. 

"It's good to know we can bring 
in subs and not lose our level of 
play," McManus commented later. 

In the second half, the flood-
gates really opened. Dulock slarted 
things by angling a shot off the 
post at 49:38 on an assist from 
Danielle Placek. 

Defender Toni Krumme fol-
lowed that with a long distance 
goal from about midway into the 
Athenas' zone to put the Tritons up 
by three. The goal, assisted by 
Schwaar, came at 54: 13. 

The scoring tandem of Mauro 
and Dulock then teamed up for a 
pair of goals. They came five 
minutes apart at 58:14 and 63:37, 
respectively, to up Dulock's sea-
son goals to 12. and Mauro's as-
sists to nine. 

Mauro then closed out the scor-
ing with a breakaway goal of her 
own, extending her school record 
to 23 for the season on an assist 
from Felicia Faro. 

The 6-0 victory closed out an 
extremely successful Division III 
regular season for the Tritons. Their 
only remaining game before the 
regionals is today against Division 
II UC Irvine, whom they defeated 
1-0 over a month ago. 

The players appear confident as 
they prepare for the regionals. 

"I'm very confident," Mauro 
stated. "We have a lot of seniors, 
and we're going to come together 
and do what it takes to win it all." 

McManus - whose team fin-
ished second in the nation last year 
- approached the upcoming play-
offs with cautious optimism. 

"We know what we' re up 
against, but we're playing very well 
right now," he said. "We've been 
treating every game as a regional 
game,and we'rejustgoingtokeep 
dOing the same things that got us to 
this point." 

"Hopefully," he added, "we can 
take it one step funher this year."

would never relinquish. 

For a moment in the second 
period, it looked as though the 
Trilons might tie it up when Greg 
Goodrich broke away, but his shot 
sailed just overthe goa\. The game 
would never be that close again. 

The Bears roared back to score 
IWO goals in under a minute, the 
first on a rocket from the arm of 
Chris Humbert, followed seconds 
later by a Pat Nelson penalty shot 
which gave Cal a 3-0 halftime ad-
vantage. 

The difference in talent gradu-
ally became evident. While the 
Tritons appeared to be tiring under 
the Bears' steady attack, the schol-
arship-laden Berkeley defense -
even with penalized players-held 
light and allowed UCSD few open 
shots. 

The second half was more of 
the same. Each time the Bears came 
down the pool, they gave Beay a 
workout, with only someexcellenl 
saves keeping the Cal lead at 5-0 
by the end of three periods. Mean-

Monday, October 30, 1989 

while, UCSD wa fighting to keep 
the ball out of the Bears ' hands. 

After Cal scored an early fourth 
period goal t~ go up 6-0, the Tri-
tons gave fans a few flickers of 
hope when senior Todd Sells re-
covered a ricochet off the top of the 
goal and fired it in with 5: 17 left. 

A raBy seemed in the works 
when the defense held on Cal's 
ensuing offense, and Goodrich, 
once again, broke out in front of 
the pack for his second one-on-one 
with the Cal goalie. This time, he 
was not denied. 

UCSD's fourth period uprising, 
however, was snuffed out as 
quickly as it caught fire when the 
Bears retaliated with three unan-
swered goals on a barrage of daz-
zling passes. 

A last minute goal by Triton 
Darrian Young ended the scoring 
and made the final 9-3. 

The Tritons wiB now take a 
couple of weeks off before the 
Western Water Polo A sociation 
(WWPA) Championships on Nov. 
10-12. The winner of this year's 
WWPA will earn an automatic 
berth to the NCAA Tournament.

Oannevik stresseothat the vic-
tories against CSUDH and Biola 
mean little when compared with 
Wednesday's match against sec-
ond-ranked La Verne. 

"This match should decide who 
will host the [Division III] west re-
gional playoffs," he said. "h might 
even be a preview of the Final 
Four ... UCSO and LaVerne have a 
history of great matches, both in 
the regular and postseasons. h 's a 
great, traditional rivalry."

It ' s about time. 
After weeks of harassment from 

ranked Division I and II teams, the 
UCSD women's volleyball team 
finally got a chance to take out its 
aggression upon weaker squads. 

The Tritons jumped at the op-
portunity, beating Biola 6-15, 16-

ing Cal State Dominguez Hills 15-
0, 15-8, 15-6 on Friday. 

Early on against Biola, it seemed 
like UCSD had overestimated its 
advantage over the NAJA Eagles. 
For the better part of two games, 
the Tritons looked like they never 
quite made it out of bed that mom-

ing, while Biola came out sharp 
and capitalized on UCSO's som-
nambulation. 

In the first game, Biola took a 5-
3 lead after a long rail y, and tallied 
seven points in quick succession to 
go up 12-3. The Tritons put up 
little struggle as the Eagles flew to 
a 15-6 triumph. 

Things really began to get 
worrisome for UCSO as the sec-
ond game shaped up as a carbon 
copy of the first. Once again, Biola 
won a long, exciting rally to lead 
5-3, before it rolled up what looked 
to be an insurmountable 14-6 ad-
vantage. 

The tables suddenly turned on 
Biola as UCSD began to play like 
a team possessed, while the Eagles

UCSD Makes Tournament Despite the Odds 

Men's Soccer Gets Regional Call 
By KARA ASSANAKIS 
COlllriblllinK Writer 

With a 12-5-3 record, the 10 s 
of everal vital players due to 
graduation, and a number of criti-
cal injuries throughout the year, it 
eemed unlikely that the men' 
occerteam wou Id get to defend its 

Division III national title. 
La t night, an NCAA regional 

election committee gave the 
Triton thatchancewhentheycho e 
them to be part of a four-team 
regional partially ho ted by Clare-
mont College next weekend. 

The Tritons will travel to face 
rival Claremont in a I p.m. game 
next Sunday. The victor will play 
the winner of the west regional ' 
other half at the quarterfinal the 
following week. Theotherhalfwill 
feature St. John' of Minnesota and 
Colorado College, the latter of 

which the Triton defeated 2-1 
earlier this month. 

"It won't be as easy for Clare-
mont to beat us a it was la t time," 
Head Coach Derek Armstrong 
explained, referring to Claremont' 
2-1 victory over UCSDthis year. 

In a rotating sy tern where two 
of the six regionals receive a bye, 
the Tritons will only need to win 
two games for a retum engage-
ment at the final four. 

The Triton 'regional election 
was not a given, however, a they 
needed to win their last four 
game - and did - the final two 
over Redlands, 2-1, and Loyola 
Marymount, 5-1, this weekend. 

In Friday' victory over Red-
land . fir t-half goals by Craig

Water Polo Takes Two In Claremont 

Cal Overpowers UCSD 
By STEVE WEISMAN 
ContriblllillK Writer 

Even before they entered the 
water last Friday afternoon, there 
was little hope for the eighth-
ranked Triton to come away with 
a victory over the top-ranked UC 
Berkeley (Cal) Bears. 

In a game Triton Head Coach 
Denny Harper likened to "Or-
ange Glen High School playing 
Notre Dame in football," the 18-
2 Bears proved they were no fluke 
in a 9-3 sinking of UCSD. 

On Saturday, however, the 
Tritons picked up an 19-10 win 
over Claremont and a 10-6 vic-
tory over Air Force at the Clare-
mont Mini-Tournament. 

The win over Air Force virtu-
ally assured the Tritons of the 
number one seeding when they 
host the Western Water Polo 
Association Championships in 
November. 

In the Claremont game, Tri-
ton Jason "Turtle" Brown set a 
new school record with nine 

goals, breaking the old record of 
seven et by three player . Brown 
added three more goals in the Air 
Force game. 

The Cal game, however, was 
a di fferent tory for the 17-12 
Tritons. 

The game wa close in the 
early-going, but by the end of the 
first half the Bears had taken 
control. 

"They've got talent, ize and 
speed," Harper said after the 
game. "They know we're tough 
at home, but they were more than 
ready." 

Though the game was to turn 
into a lopsided affair, the action 
began with what Harper described 
as "an interesting first period." 

Both teams emerged from the 
gates with strong defense, and 
the only score of the first period 
came with just under two min-
utes left. A close easy lob by 
Berkeley's Julian Baily past the 
outstretched arms of Triton goalie 
J. P. Beay gave Cal a lead it

Women's Soccer 
Racks up 15th 
Shutout; now 15-1 
By TOM RIZZUTI 
Contributing Writer 

With the women's soccer 
team heading to the 1989 West-
ern Regional Champion hip in 
Minnesota next weekend, the 
squad saw the light at the end of 
the tunnel as it steamrolled over 
the Athena of Claremont Col-
leg Friday at the North Campus 
Stadium. 

Fueled by a second half 
scoring barrage that included 
three goals by sophomore for-
ward Katy Dulock, the Tritons 
breezed to a 6-0 victory. 

With the win, UCSD upped 
its record to 15- 1 on the year 
and retained the number one 
ranking in NCAA Division III 
which it finally attained a week 
ago. The Tritons will be the top 
seed at the four team regional 
tournament, which will be 
hosted by Macalester College 
in St. Paul, Minnesota. The Tri-
tons will face fourth-seeded 
Macalester in the first round, 
while second seed St. Mary's 
(Winona, MN) will face St. 
Thomas (St. Paul). 

Friday's game began 
inauspiciously for UCSD, 
however, as Claremont pene-
trated into the Triton zone on 
the opening kickoff. But Clare-
mont could not manage a shot, 
and would not get any more 
chances for the rest of the day. 

Using disciplined ball con-
trol and superior speed, the 
Tritons continually pressed the 
Athenas' defense. After sev-
eral close shots in the early 
going, senior Teresa Schwaar 
found the net on a feed from 
Heather Mauro at 24:25 for the
