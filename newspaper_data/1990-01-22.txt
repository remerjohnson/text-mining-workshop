Sexual Assault Suspect 
Ordered to Stand Trial 
• UCSD Student Testifies At Preliminary Hearing 

By RANDY DOTINGA 
Senior Staf/Writer 

After a preliminary hearing marked by 
tearful testimony from a UCSD first-year 
student, 23-year-old David Millerwas bound 
over for trial Friday, on charges of kidnap-
ing and sexually assaulting two local col-
lege students. 

San Diego Municipal Court Judge 
Frederic L. Link scheduled Miller's arraign-
ment for Feb. 2, and set his bail at $250,000. 

Miller has pleaded not guilty to two counts 
of kidnapping, two counts of forced oral 
copulation, and two counts of rape with a 
foreign object. Miller may face 40 years or 
more in prison if convicted on all counts, 
according to Deputy District Attorney David 
Lattuca, the prosecuter. 

The witness said she stayed on the line, 
despite her desire to hang up, because "he 
proceeded to threaten people that I knew. He 
threatened to send friends of his to where I 
lived to rape my roommate. He then threat-
ened my family." 

After talking for about two hours with the 
caller, the witness said she drove to meet 
him in downtown San Diego. 

"He told me to meet him there. If I didn't 
he would find my family and have people 
hurt them," she testified.

MONDAY, JANUARY 22,1990 

The first witness, a UCSD student, testi-
fied that she was sexually assaulted by Miller 
after he coerced her through a telephone call 
to meet him in downtown San Diego. 

When she reached downtown, she parked 
in a parking lot and a man, whom she iden-
tified in court as Miller, entered her car and 
sexually assaulted her. They later drove to 
the parking lot of V alhalla High School in EI 
Cajon, where the witness said she was as-. 
saulted again and performed sex acts on 
Miller at his request. 

"I felt threatened. I was afraid," she said, 
fighting back tears.

The male caller first asked for her room-
mate, who was at a sorority function, the 
witness said. 

"He asked what [my roommate] was 
like. I responded that I couldn't tell him 
exactly, because I had only known her a few 
weeks," she said. 

The caller went on to ask h~r questions 
about herself. "He asked me what my fears 
were," she said. 

The witness said she wanted to hang up, 
but "he proceeded to tell me that he didn't 
like it when people rushed him off the tele-
phone ... He told me that he was involved 
in organized crime. "

Columbia University litera-
ture Professor Edward Said ad-
dressed the current situation in 
Israel and the occupied territo-
ries Thursday night at UCSD 
before an audience of approxi-
mately 200 people. 

Said's discussion, sponsored 
by UCSD's Committee in Soli-
darity with Palestine and the 
Middle East Cultural and Infor-
mation Center in San Diego, 

examined the present and future 
implications of the recent events 
in the Palestinian uprising, 
known as the Intifada. 

At this point in the uprising, 
now in its third year, Said be-
lieves that Palestinian goals have 
been solidified. 

"We are fully embarked on 
the course towards statehood," 
said Said, a Jersualem-bom Pal-
estinian. 

"The Palestinians have de-
cided collectively - and I think 
this is the fur.darr eptal meaning

of the Intifada - that there is 
no return to the status quo, that 
now we are upon a march to-
wards political independence 
and sovereignty." 

Said outlined many ob-
stacles the Palestinians confront 
in pursuit of their goals. He 
feels that there is widespread 
awareness of the Israeli 
military's "cruel and inhuman 
practices, as discussed by ev-
ery international agency worth 
its soul - Amnesty [Inter-
national], the United Nations, 
even the U.S. State Depart-
ments' annual survey of hu-
man rights abuses." 

He likened Palestinians to a 
nation of prisoners. "Here you 
have the capture of what is in 
effect 1.8 million people, who 
are living without rights in a 
state of apartheid ruled by mili-
tary authority," Said said 

"That is to say, the entire 
system of justice on the West 
B'ank and Gaza is administered 
by the military, which has 
complete authority with im-
punity to rule anything it 
wishes. It can arrest anybody 
without trial. It can detain any-
body without trial. It can tor-
ture; the torture of Palestinians 
on the West Bank and Gaza is 
systematic. Thatcontinues, anu 
it is again t that that Palestini-
an today truggle mo t power-
fully and, in my opinion, irre-
sistibly," he said. 

Said proposed that the pur-

pose of the occupation is "to 
punish and humiliate, to break 
the spirit of an entire nation, the 
Palestinians." He added that the 
U.S. foreign aid package allo-
cates more to Israel, over $3 bil-
lion a year, than it does to any 
other country. "What must not 
be forgotten ... is that the U.S., 
we as taxpayers, are in effect 
paying for the military occupa-
tion," he said. 

According to Said, the U.S. 
and Israel are delaying the peace 
process. "There is now on the 
table - and there has been since 
November 1988-a formal offer 
of peace [presented] by the Pal-
estinians to Israel. " 

Said feels that "the interna-
tional consensus today is . . . 
formed around the notion of 
partition, ... that there should be 
two states, one Palestinian and 
one Israeli, on the land ofhistori-
cal Palestine and that they should 
enter into processes of mutual 
security and recognition, thereby 
ending, comprehensively, the 
struggle between the Palestinian 
and the Israeli people. Yet the 
occupation continue . 

"In the end, it is only the 
United States and Israel that are 
holding out," he said. 7 

Nonetheless, he predicts that 
Pale tinians will succeed in their 
efforts to gain overeign tate-
hood on the We t Bank and Gaza 
Strip. He foresees I rael as "a 
small Middle Eastern state like

UC-Wide Meeting On Racial 
Issues To Be Held at UCSD 

A UC student lobby is holding a conference this 
month to discuss the concerns and needs of colored 
students, lobby representatives said. 

The UC Student Association (UCSA) is holding the 
"Students of Color Conference" at UCSD on Jan. 27 and 
28, because the diversity issue is one of the lobby's major 
campaigns, UCSA Director Dale Kelly Bankhead said. 

"Students of color at the UC campuses are facing 
.critical issues in the 1990s . .. this is an opportunity for 
students to network, and then we can discover how 
UCSA can best representlhesestudents," UCLA's UCSA 
representative Lloyd Monsematt said. 

Joyce Justus, UC' s assistant vice president for educa-
tional relations, will be the keynote speaker. She wrote a 
report that is used as the basis for discussions on faculty 
diversity, Bankhead said. 

"This is really exciting, because her report ties into 
everything we 're talking about," UCSA 's field represen-
tative Sophia Knowg said. 

UC student representatives will lead discussions on 
issues that affect students of color at UC schools such as 
retention, affirmative action programs, campus climate, 
graduate student programs, faculty diversity, ethnic 
studies, and leadership. 

The student lobby expects about 200 people to attend, 
Bankhead said. 

Guillermo Rodgriguez, the UC student regent, will 
speak on the meeting's affirmative action panel.

UCLA Cancels Controversial 
Visit By Israeli Defense Minister 

The UCLA Campus Events office received a number 
of complaints protesting the use of registration fees to 
bring Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin to campus. 

The students opposed to Campus Events' sponsorship 
of the event included members of the Musl im Student 
Association and the Palestinian Student Association, 
according to Campus Events. 

Rabin' s visit, which was cancelled last Tuesday 
morning by the Israeli consulate, was co-sponsored by

"We were not opposed to his coming. We were

" We don't think Campus Events should have spon-

West Bank and Gaza Strip," sophomore Arafat Karim 
said. 

But Campus Events Commissioner Mike Fuqua denied 
that sponsoring Rabin was contrary to the goals of the 
Campus Events Speakers Program. 

"Mr. Rabin 's scheduled appearance does not signal a

"As in the past, Campus Events will continue to invite

UCLA community," Fuqua wrote in a memo to the 
undergraduate council Tuesday.

Former UCLA Students Charged 
With Theft of University Funds 

Three former UCLA student employees, charged 
with stealing University gas cards and using them for 
ex tensive personal travel , were scheduled to be arraigned 
last Tuesday, but only one appeared, and pleaded not 
gUilty. 

Concluding what UCLA Det Armando Ruiz called 
"an enormous paper chase," University police filed state 
embezzlement and grand theft charges against Aaron 
Tores, Scott McNeal, and Robert Vela on Jan. 9, Ruiz 
said. Both charges are felonies. 

Tores, 23, denied involvement in both felony charges 
and is scheduled to appear at a preliminary trial Feb. 13 
at Los Angeles Superior Court 

Warrants for the arrest of McNeal and Vela, both 23, 
were issued Tuesday following their faiiure to appear in 
court, district attorney officials said. 

Police claim one of the three defendants broke into a 
locked drawer in UCLA's Central Garage in March 1989 
and took the cards, which were used to pay gas bills for 
personal trips as far away as San Francisco and Las 
Vegas, Ruiz said 

The defendants allegedly charged as much as $2,000 
worth of gas over a period of five months, Ruiz said.

mental deterioration. Death occurs by the age of five. 

Tay-Sachs carriers are perfectly healthy individuals. 
They have no symptoms and can only be identified 
through a simple blood test. This blood test will be 
available in the Cove Room at the Price Center Wednes-
day from 10 a.m. to2 p.m. and at Revelle's Why Not Here 

caf~ from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m.

many others. It will not for long, I 
think, be a regional superpower." 

After Said's lecture, the floor 
was opened to questions. Tempers 
flared at certain points in the dis-
cussion. More than once, UCSD 
literature Professor Masao 
Miyoshi 's attempts at moderating 
the discussion were drowned out 
by shouts from an impassioned au-
dience debating the issue of a Pal-
estinian homeland. 

At one point, a student in the 
audience who had studiedinJerusa-
lem told of conversations with 
Palestinian peers that left him 
uneasy. 

"As a Jew who has been with-
out a homeland for 2,000 years, 
when I read in the paper of a two-
state solution and then I go into the 
Palestinian community in East 
Ierusalem and I hear [palestinians] 
speak amongst themselves of not a 
two-state solution but the Greater 
Palestine, that's terrifying to me," 
said the student. 

He said that Greater Palestine 
refers to Israel plus the occupied 
territories. 

"I don't see adequate reassur-
ance by the Palestinian people that 
there's going to be a state of Is-
rael," the student continued. After 
a tense exchange with Said, the 

-... 

student acknowledged that he, a as 
aJew, would be willingtonegoti-
ate with the Palestinians, a state-
ment which drew enthusiastic ap-
plause from the audience. 

In his closing remarks, Said 
looked at "the tremendous suffer-
ings of the Jewish people, in par-
ticular the Holocaust," cautioning 
that it was important to separate 
Jewish history from "what the 
survivors of that tragedy are now 
doing to another people." 

In Said's view, " there'snornoral 
justification for the survivors of a 
tremendous historical tragedy in-
flicting upon another people a se-
ries of oppressive measures which

Taxing Questions 

Church and State 
The Supreme Court ruled last Wednesday that religious groups 

are not exempt from sales tax - and left the door open for other 
taxation. This ruling has created furor among religious leaders, 
who argue that this threatens religious freedom, and violates the 
First Amendment right to the free exercise of religion. Their view 
does not stand up to close scrutiny. 

The court decision came in a case involving the state of 
California's taxation of the sale of Bibles, pamphlets, and tapes 
by Jimmy Swaggart Ministries. 

In a unanimous decision written by Justice Sandra Day 
O'Connor, the court upheld California's right to tax. Her opinion 
tempered this right by stating a tax which "might effectively 
choke off an adherent's religious practices" would violate the 
First Amendment. 

This decision, while narrowly defined, has potentially broad 
effects. It gives states the right, if they choose, to tax churches' 
property and income. But it certainly does not require states to 
tax, nor bar them from exempting churches. Some opponents of 
tax exemptions for churches have ar-
gued that exemption are a subsidy 
for religion, but the court -
rightly-rejects this view. 

The court, again 
correctly, said 
frrmlythat 

as long as churches are not treated differently from other -
secular - non-profit organizations, it is acceptable to tax them. 

The case for the sales tax is the strongest. When a church 
behaves like a business, selling items such as religious books, it 
does not have the right to avoid paying its due to the government. 
It may argue that the profits are being used for good works, but 
then Jane Doe can argue that her income is beir,g used to feed and 
clothe her family, so why is she taxed? Society has judged that 
sellers must give part of their money from sales to the state. It 
doesn't matter what the good is, or who is selling it. 

Opponents of the taxation of religious groups should take 
comfort that state legislatures are unlikely to begin extensive 
taxing. In fact, California is the only state that does not com-
pletely exempt churches from taxation. 

But states should have the right to tax if they wish. Taxation 
does not establish a state religion - all groups are taxed equally 
- nor does it impair the practice of religion. Thus, the founders' 
intent expressed in the First Amendment is not violated. 

Another criticism of this ruling is that it allows churches to 
become taxpayers, which gives them the right to demand repre-
sentation commiserate with their taxation. 

This isn't too strong an argument. Churches already demand 
attention from politicians, saying they represent the moral strength 
of their adherents and the moral fabric of the nation. The recent 
attempt by a Catholic Archbishop to influence Lucy Killea' s 
assembly race is an example of this sort of behavior. But 
Democrat Killea's victory in a heavily Republican district put in 
stark relief the limits of churches political clout. Most people 
don't want churches - even their church -'- dabbl ing in govern-
ment matters. Taxation would have little effect on this. 

The ruling was a good one. It more clearly defines the 
constitutional limits on the mixing of church and state, and it 
deals properly with limits of taxation. Those worrying of a 
"slippery slope" to mingling of church and state - or the 
repression of the church by the state - should relax and take 
comfort that this ruling does not undennine the Constitution. It 
instead remains true to it. 

Commentary concept. 

Feminists Go Too Far 
Now don't get me wrong: I do 

understand that a lot of the femi-
nist complaints are valid. Yes, it is 
true that some employers impose 
a double standard and still pay 
women less than men. And it is 
true that some men don't give 
women any respect as a compe-
tent equal. 

By JULIE PUZON, Con RefUkr 
The feminist movement and 

those behind it never cease to 
amaze me. I find it quite amusing 
that when they find anything 
slightly offensive to the women's 
movement they are quick to 
scream "sexism" and "discrimi-
nation." 

For example, "sexist" language 
is an issue which offends them. I 
now must be careful to recon-
struct my sentences as not to of-
fend anyone. "He" must be re-
placed with "he or she," etc. 

What's the big deal? As a 
woman, it has never offended me 
in any way. It is so trivial. Yet, I 
hear ranting and raving on how we 
should incorporate non-sexist 
language into our own daily lan-
guage because if wedidn 't it would 
be "institutionalized discrimina-
tion." 

I also remember a heated de-
bate in the Opinion section of The 
Guardian concerning a small edi-
torial cartoon by Steve Benson 
which appeared in the Oct. 30 is-
sue of The Guardian. 

As I recall, the cartoon (which, 
I might add, was only one man's 
opinion) was dubbed sexist and 
The Guardian was blasted for dis-
crimination against women. And, 
if memory serves me correctly, 
they were also asked to apologize 
to the women of UCSD for run-
ning it. 

There, however, is a fine line 
between discrimination and out-
right complaining. We've been 
giving in to constant whining long 
enough. 

With this in mind, I would like 
to applaud the Guardian's revi-
sion of its "non-sexist language" 
policy. As I write, I can just pic-
ture the letters coming in from 
feminists everywhere screaming 
"discrimination" and calling the 
Gutlrdian staff a bunch of sexist 
pigs. 

But whllt about the discrimina-
tion which has occurred against 

men in the quest for women's 
equality? 

How many times have we seen 
commercials depicting men as 
stupid imbeciles who can't do 
anything without women to guide 
them? 

How many times are we faced 
with the stereotypical man who is 
all brawn with no brain? Or even 
the macho and insensitive man? 
Are the feminists 'concerned about 
that? I don't hear them cornplain-
in£. 

And isn't it strange that if 
women are pro-women, then they 
are feminists, and if men are pro-
men, they are called chauvinists? 
They are two similar ideas, yet 
they carry different connotations. 
The former is portrayed as ajusti-
fiable cause while the latter is 

But it seems to me that we 
women are implementing the 
"double standard" and disrespect 
that we so viciously detest by al-
lowing men to be portrayed in the 
ways described above. 

The men, in these cases, are the 
ones coming up with the prover-
bial short end of the stick. This 
treatment can only be detrimental 
to the feminist cause; they ought 
to know that nobody can establish 
equality by degrading the other 
side. 

Maybe we should all consider 
the discriminations that we both 
sexes foster and allow before 

viewed as a demeaning, sexist crying out any "injustices." 

UCSD Art's Vices and Virtues 
Editor: 

What is art? The definition of an is under argument, as more radical 
and unconventional methods of expressing ourselves emerge. Without 
going into any history of "art," I believe the 20th century has marked the 
development of a new attitude toward self expression. No definitions 
apply, and generalities are too vague to describe art in 1990. What may 
be an eyesore for one, may be true allistic genius for another. 

Because ofthe diverse tastes of our population it becomes difficult 
to define art, much less decorate our environment with creations that are 
aesthetically pleasing to everyone. However, "the needs of the many 
outweigh the needs of the few orthe one." I seriously question the reality 
of the art decision-making of our university as being representative of 
the student population majority. 

I recall walking through the Warren aApattment parking lot with 
some friends who were visiting from Cal Poly Pomona. They remarked 
about the drab, lifeless architecture of our university. I reject.ed their 
commentary quite zealously. I pointed out the remarkable colors of our 
railing, the incipient stages of our trees (marking hope for the future), 
and the sorrowful condition of their own university. 

I proceeded to mock them about their surroundings, noting the 
majesty of San Diego, America's Finest City. I was like a devout 
crusader, putting my heathen foes to rout! Any UCSD student would 
have been proud to witness such fearless defense of our fine institution. 
But at the pinnacle of the conquest my arrogance was destroyed by a 
single, unforeseen weapon to which I had no defense. 

"Matt, what is that?" Realizing my fate I glanced up at the neon sign 
which flashed like a cheap beer advertisement' in a Tijuana bar. "Glut-

GUAkDIAN Cl -Up 
A Day at the Municipal Court Zoo 

By JEFF QUAN, Graphics Editor 
Last Friday, I was in Municipal Court. 
No, I wasn't on trial, but I was observing a 

preliminary hearing. Since I'm not a reporter, the 
reason for me being there was to draw sketches in 
case the judge objected to any photography. This 
was the first time I had ever stepped foot inside a 
courtroom, and I have one thing to say about 
being in one: It's a zoo. 

The zoo is not a result of the people who enter 
the courtroom, but of the people who work there. 
My vision of what a courtroom would be like 
came from what I've seen on television: a room 
populated by two lawyers, a bailiff, a clerk, a 
stenographer, witnesses, defendants, and ajudge. 
A very serious atmos-
phere pervades the court-
room. 

Or does it? 
That Friday morning, 

1 was graced with the pres-
ence of the Honorable 
Judge Frederic C. Link. I 
figured that the judge 
would set the pace and 
mood of the court, and 
my first impression was 
that he was a very serious 
and harsh man. I was to 
be proven wrong. When a 
case is put forth on the 
stand, everyone in the 
roombecomesdeathlyse-
rious, as I expected. However, as soon as a break 
is called in the proceedings, everything goes nuts. 

The lawyers in the room suddenly break into 
amiable conversation as if nothing has happened. 

A clerk walks in with some incomprehensible • 
fact that has no bearing on anything that has 
transpired in the courtroom. 

The judge starts reminiscing about the time he 
and some friends ran into a couple of wild guys 
after a party. 

In fact, there is nothing left to remind me that 
a case was tried, except for the fact that I'm still 
sitting in a courtroom. 

I present for the prosecution Exhibit A-the 
judge. On the outside, he resembles my precon-
ception of a judge: a wizened face, a black robe, 
a stem voice. But I was surprised to learn how 
pleasant it was to talk to him. My first conversa-
tion with him went sometliing like this: 

Judge: "Who is the artist who wants pennis-

bed time.) 

sion to draw in here?" 
Artist (not knowing what to expect): "I am." 
Judge (in a stem voice): "So, you want to 

become a courtroom artist?" 
Artist (sheepishly): "Uh, welL" 
Okay, so it doesn ' t sound like the most ami-

able of conversations, but the judge is wise. Case 
in point: he talked to the reporter I was with and 
told him that there are all sons of "jerks" in the 
world, and not all of them are defendants. Wow, 
courtroom wisdom. 

The judge is also honorable, as attested to by 
one of the attorneys, who defended the judge's 
reputation in a dialogue so exaggerated that one 
began to wonder if they had tried out for summer 
stock at the Old Globe Theater in Balboa Park. 

The judge likes to see 
things in a new light. 
When he found out that I 
was drawing his portrait 
he requested that I make 
him thinner, because he 
wanted to see his face 
different than normal. 
Truth, justice, and the 
artistic way were work-
ing against him in this 
case. 

The judge spends 
quality time with his 
family, as shown by his 
interest in his son's school 
science project-testing 
condoms. He told about a 

trip to the Price Club: "Can you imagine the 
cashier's face when me and my son approach and 
ask for a hundred condoms?" It's refreshing to 
know that a father takes so much interest in his 
son's work. 

What is the verdict of my case? While first im-
pressions are everything, they amount to nothing. 
I found the judge to be both funny and warm. In 
the course of two hours, the courtroom went from 
being "TIle People's Court" to "Night Court." As 
in "The People's Court," cases are tried with the 
utmost professionalism. As in "Night Court," 
formality goes to pieces during court recesses, 
and believe me, these people take recess very 
seriously. 

What a zoo!

could feel it coming. No one would 
give up such a glorious opportu-

Note that I have not recom-

art. To be honest, I kind of get a 
kick out of an an student occa-
sionally planting a screw in front 
of the Engineering Building. 

I know that unanimous agree-
ment on artistic quality is im-
possible, but if the students have 
a greater say on the decoration 
of our "home" I would have at 
least a little peace of mind when 
I am ridiculed by foreigners. 

My response produced a laugh-
ter so hysterical that Robin Wil-

safety of his career. I knew what 
was next. 

"Vacancy ... no vacancy," they 
cheered. I could hardly wait for

they were very "fascinated" by 
the talking trees, and the elevated 
blue fences were "interesting." If 
I had a nickel for every time they 
asked if UCSD "actually paid for 
that," I could easily afford next 
year's mandatory fees. 

The only comment I heard of 
any constructi ve value was, "They

A Close Shave: Occam's Razor and President Bush's Popularity 
NEW YORK - So George Bush has 

been president for a year, and his popularity 
ratings are staggeringly high. The compul-
sory question before the house is: Why? 

To answer the question honestly you 
need a simple household device: a razor; to 
be specific, Occam's Razor. Occam, more 
formally known as William of Occam, was 
a 14th-century Eng-

talked. 
For years, the boy's parents had taken 

him to every expert they could find. Tests 
showed the boy to be bright, healthy, with 
perfectly normal hearing and all the physi-
cal ability to speak. He showed no signs of 
mental or emotional illness; he simply never 
talked. 

lish philosopher who 
coined one of the 
most valuable, and 
most widely ignored, 
principles of clear 

Jeff Greenfield 
Then one day the 

boy came down to 
breakfast, dug into 
his cereal, looked up 
at his mother and 
said, "Hey, Mom, 

Universal Press Syndicate 

this oatmeal 's cold." thinking: "Entities are not to be multiplied 
beyond necessity." 

In other words, don't conjure up an 
hour-long answer to a question that can be 
answered in three minutes. 

After a moment of shocked silence, the 
boy's mother gasped, "You can talk per-
fectly, but for all these years, you've never 
said a word. Why?" 

Using Occam's Razor to cut away ir-
relevant or unimportant information, we 
can dispense with silly questions, such as 
why President Bush is more popular than 
Reagan was even though Bush doesn ' t give 
memorable speeches or radiate power from 
the television screen. 

To which the boy replied, "Up to now, 
everything's been fine." 

Here is just about everything you need to 
know about the president's popularity. For 
the public (theeight-year-old boy), thepresi-
dent (the oatmeal) is just fine. 

It's all explained by the story, told here 
before, of the eight-year-old boy who never 

We're at peace in the world, and the one 
overt use of American anned might ended 
with apparent success in Panama, with little 

Trying to find a Democratic opposition with the wit 
or guts to fight hard on these issues is like holding 
a mirror up to the mouth of a comatose patient, 
looking for the faintest signs of life.

sign of widespread second thoughts about 
the number of dead civilians or the prece-
dent for interventionism. 

The fear of nuclear war with the Soviet 
Union, a staple of the international land-
scape for most of the postwar era, has just 
about vanished. And communism, once 
feared as the totalitarian wave of the future, 
now seems to be melting away faster than 
the Wicked Witch of the West. 

The economy seems fine, with the disas-
trous consequences of the trade and budget 
deficits still a matter of conjecture rather 
than reality. Unemployment is low, infla-

because Bush seems to have no ideology 
whatsoever. 

There is no debate over aid to the Nica-
raguan rebels, no nuclear freeze movement 
waming of impending nuclear winter, no 
alarms being sounded over single-issue 
theocratic zealots out to destroy the First 
Amendment. 

In fact, with the single exception of the 
abortion issue, the only matters that seem 
worth really getting angry about are issues 
for which the entire political establishment 
bears bipartisan responsibili ty : the savings 
and loan scandal, for example, or the crime 

... this placid vista Is presided over by an amiable 
fellow who, unlike Ronald Reagan In his first term,

tion is under control, and none of the pow-
erful images of economic distress - shut-
tered plants and factories, gasoline lines, 
rampant price hikes at the grocery store -
are part of the current landscape. 

Moreover, this placid vista is presided 
over by an amiable fellow who, unlike 
Ronald Reagan in his first tenn, is attempt-
ing simply to preserve the current political 
atmosphere rather than to roil it. 

Bush, unlike Reagan, stirs little ideo-
logical antipathy, principally because 
Reagan fought those brazenly divisive 
battles almost a decade ago, additionally 

epidemic in our cities. 
Trying to find a Democratic opposition 

with the wit or guts to fight hard on these 
issues is like holding a mirror up to the 
mouth of a comatose patient, looking for 
the faintest signs of life. 

I still believe that George Bush ' s failure 
to define where he wants to lead this coun-
try reflects a potential political vulnerabil-
ity: If the oatmeal ever does get cold, the 
complaints will be long and loud. Right 
now, though, there's no particular reason 
for the eight-year-old boy to say anything 
much at all.

HEARING: UCSD and SDSU Students 
Testify Against Sexual Assault Suspect 
Continued from page 1 

After leaving the high school, 
they drove to a parking structure in 
downtown, where Miller assaulted 
her agajn, the witness said. 

Miller let her go around 7 a.m. 
and she drove back to her resi-
dence hall, she said. Later that day, 
she reported the assault to her house 
advisor and then to the police. 

During cross examination, 
deputy public defender Terry 
Zimmerman, representing Miller, 
repeatedly asked the witness if she 
had objected to the man's advances, 
or if she bad tried to get help from 
passersby. The witness, appearing 
disconcerted, responded "No" or 
" I don't remember" to the 
attorney's questions. 

Under cross examination, the 
wi tness also gave conflicting testi-
mony about the exact details of 
one aspect of the alleged sexual as-
saUlt, and testified that she knew 
she was going to engage in sexual 
acts with the caller when she went 

to give the caller an envelope with 
a picture of her roommate in it, so 
he could compare it with the pic-
ture he had. She then expected to 
leave. 

A man, whom she identified in 
court as Miller, then approached 
her vehicle, she testified. 

"I opened up the window on the 
passenger side and handed the 
pioture out .... He told me to let 
him in and banged on the window. 

"He said he just wanted to talk 
to me ... to make things clear," the 
witness testified. "I was very 
scared . . .. 1 unlocked the door and 
he opened it and got in." 

. After Miller told the witness 
that her roommate was not the 
person he was looking for, they 
drove a residence and then to 
downtown San Diego, she said. 
There, he told her to get money 
from a bank machine with her A TM 
card, she said. After she got money, 
they drove to a mark.et and then 
several rniles down a dirt road until 

indicate that a lack of consent was 
ever communicated," the defense 
concluded. 

In the prosecution's closing, 
Lattuca argued that the victims 
feared not only for themselves, but 
for their loved ones. 

"The defendent not only threat-
ened the victims . . . they were 
concemed for the safety of other 
people - family and friends," the 
prosecution said. 

In his decision to send the case 
to trial, Judge Link said the case 
was "very unusual . . .. It does not 
fit the normal forcible sexual as-
sault or rape case," he said . 

However, citing several related 
court cases, the judge said that a 
crime may occur if an anacker's 
threats are unreasonable. 

"What I would do or what any-
one else would do is not the impor-
tant part of this case . ... Both of 
these ladies submitted because he 
threatened them and took advan-
tage," the j udge said, before find-

San Diego Police Detective Ken Creese, defense attorney Terry Zimmerman, and defendant 
David Millier (front, I-r). 
to meet him. 

The second witness, a San Di-
ego State University (SDSU) first-
year student, testified that she was 
sexually assaulted by Miller after 
he called her saying he suspected 
her roommate may be a criminal. 

The witness testified that she 
had received the call last Nov. 15. 
The caller said "he was looking for 
people connected with drugs," and 
told her that her roommate might 
be such a person, she testified. 

The caller told the witness that 
her roommate "sounded like a girl 
he had a picture of," who was 
supposedly involved in drugs, the 
witness testified. The caller had 
telephoned her roommate and 
another person in her residence 
hall earlier that day, she said. 

When asked by the judge why 
she didn't hang up on Miller, she 
said: "At first, Ijust listened to his 
story. Then he started to get mean, 
graphic, and threatening .... He 
said that he didn't like my room-
mate, and [his friends] would be 
sent up to gang-rape her. 

"He told mel could either meet 
him or he could send his men over. 
.. . We could be raped or possJ bly 
killed," the witness said. The caller 
also threatened that he would "cut 
me into 50 pieces" if she did not 
cooperate with him, the witness 
said. 

The witness, who said she was 
very frightened by the caller, testi-
fied that after talking to the man for 
about 15 minutes, she drove to 
meet him on Orange Avenue in 
San Diego, after warning her 
friends to call the police if she was 
not back soon. 

She said she sat in her car with 
the engine on and the windows 
closed and doors locked, planning 

they pulled over, she said. 
Miller then told her to "make 

him feel good." 
"I felt very threatened . ... I was 

very scared for my life, and I just 
felt the only thing to do was to 
cooperate and get out alive," she 
said. 

She also testified that Miller 
had told her that if she called the 
police, "I'd be dead by the time I 
reached court." 

The witness, who remained 
composed throughout her testi-
mony, said Miller left her car 
around 4 a.m. on Nov. 16. She then 
returned home and called the pa-
lice. 

Under cross examination by the 
defense, the witness said she had 
not told police about some of the 
information she had testified to 
earlier in the hearing. 

The defense attempted to show 
that the witness had not objected to 
Miller's actions and asked: "Did 
you indicate to him in any way that 
you were scared of the man in the 
car?" The witness replied that she 
had not. 

In closing, the defense attacked 
the credibility .of the witnesses, 
saying that they had, in essence, 
given consent to Miller by not 
objecting to his actions. 

"I think that the .circumstances 
of both these instances are ex-
tremely unusual and extremely 
incredible on the part of these two 
young women," the defense said. 

The defense noted that the 
UCSD victim had testified that she 
had agreed to take part in some sort 
of sexual activity with the caller 
during the initial phone conversa-
tion. 

"I think the case should be 
thrown out. ... There is nothing to 

ing probable cause that Miller had 
committed each of the six counts 
filed against him. 

Miller was arrested on Nov. 16 
by San Diego Police. According to 
San Diego Police Detective Ken 
Creese, a male called an SDSU 
student that day, saying he had 
criminal information about her 
roommate. 

The student set up a meeting 
with the man, and then called pa-
lice. Officers went in her place to 
the meeting point on EI Cajon 
Blvd., where they met Miller and 
arrested him, Creese said. 

Miller has been imprisoned 
several times since 1986, accord-
ing to Cecil Parish, unit supervisor 
of the California Department of 
Corrections Parole Division in El 
Cajon. 

Parish said Miller was jailed in 
February 1986 after being con-
victed for receiving stolen prop-
erty. Miller was paroled in Sep-
tember 1986, and then violated 
parole twice, according to Parish, 
by allegedly making threatening 
phone calls and allegedly raping a 
17-year-old female. 

Although the 17-year-old did 
not press charges, the alleged rape 
was still a parole violation, Parish 
said. Miller was jailed after each 
alleged parole violation, accord-
ing to Parish. 

At the time of the sexual as-
saults, Miller was in violation of 
parole for having failed to report to 
his parole officer, and a warrant 
had been issued for his arrest, Parish 
said. 

According to Deputy District 
Attorney Lattuca, it would be up to 
a judge's discretion as to whether 
Miller's crimina! record would be 
admissible during a jury trial.

Event 
Focuses 
on Orient 
By DOREEN ERENEA 
Staff Writer 

This week is Asian Cultural 
Awareness Week, a time for stu-
dents to try to experience another 
culture through workshops and 
cultural displays. 

"We're trying to break the image 
of the Asian student. There seems 
to be a stereotype," said Liberti ne 
Trajano, vicechairmanoftheAsian 
Pacific Student Alliance (APSA), 
which has set up the event. 

The student organizations in-
volved in the event are: APSA, 
Asian Graduate Association, 
American and Japanese Cross-
Cultural Society, Chinese Student 
Association, Indonesian Student 
Association, Kaibigan Pilipino, 
Korean American Student Asso-
ciation, Pan Asian Staff Associa-
tion, Sangram, the Asian Indian 
Organization, and the Vietnamese 
Student Association. 

All of the Asian organizations 
on campus comprise APSA, which 
is the larger "umbrella" club, ac-
cording to Trajano. She said that a 
committee comprised of principal 
members of APSA planned the 
activities for the event. 

"We spent two quarters getting 
together and deciding what kinds 
of events we would have for the 
week," Trajano explained 

"We decided on what would 
represent the Asian people," she 
said "We wanted events that we 
could deal with and that others 
could relate to also." 

The events for the week are as 
follows: 

• On Jan. 22 there is an Asian 
Food Fair at Revelle Plaza from 11 
a.m. to 2 p.m. and a film on con-
temporary Japanese Life at Peter-
son Hall at 7 p.m. 

• On Jan. 23 Robert Ricasa will 
speak on family/culture conflicts 
in Gallery A at 4 p.m., and there 
will be a eastern arts workshop in 
Gallery A from 11 a.m. to I p.m. 
At the end of the day, "The Last 
Emperor" will be shown al the 
Price Center Theater from 7 to to 
p.m. 

• On Jan. 24, a cultural exposi-
tion will be held in Revelle Plaza 
from 11 a.m. to I p.m. Later that 
night, plays will be perfonned at 
the Price Center Theater from 7 to 
10p.m. 

A career workshop will be held 
in Gallery A and B from 3 to 5 p.m. 
The workshop will discuss various 
career options for life after col-
lege. 

• There will be a dance at Revelle 
Plaza from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. on Jan. 
25, and a performance will be held 
on Jan. 27 at the Price Center 
Theater at 7:30 p.m. 

Trajno said that acts such as 
drumming, dance, and a martial 
arts exposition are included in the

COMPUTER CONVERSATIONS 
Students, Faculty 
Talk to Others 
Via Electronic Link 
·Story by Andrea Adleman 
Senwr Slillf Writer 

Writing a letter isn't what it used to 
be. 

Amidst the so-called telecommunica-
tion revolution of modem times, even a 
simple smile has become computerized. 

UNIX, a general computer operating 
system that began in 1979, can be found 
at several major universi ties, governmen-
tal agencies, and private corporations. 
Although used mostly in the United 
States, UNIX is networked to various 
other countries. 

With access to the UNIX computer 
system at UCSD, students, faculty, and 
staff become agents of this technological 
revolution. 

The system performs many functions. 
Sending personal letters through "elec-
tronic mail" and participating in a 
discourse on a given subject are two of 
UNIX's most popular uses. 

The dialogues take place in 
"newsgroups," which have been likened 

Gall Jobuoa/Guantian 
Jack Arnold, Jr.: "This is all about human communication.· 
to bulletin boards on which information 
is posted. There are hundreds of news-
groups, addressing a wide range of 
topics. 

The newsgroups constitute USENET, 
the general term for the whole "bulletin 
board system." 

Anyone with a UNIX account (free to 
students) can access newsgroups, but not 
all of the hundreds of news groups are 
received at each location. Each site is 

overseen by a system administrator, who 
can decide not to carry controversial "noise" 
groups. 

The newsgroups revolve &round ongoing 
discourses among many people. After a user 
logs on, he reads the news and then decides 
whether or not to write a response to the 
new information. If a response is written, 
the user must then tell the computer where 
to distribute the article, based on its

relevance to people at the various 
destinations. 

From a UCSD terminal, local 
distribution options include trans-
mission throughout UCSD, to all 
UCs, and to all of San Diego 
County. It is also possible to limit 
transmission to the original site 
only, meaning 10 lerminals in the 
same room in which the sender's 
lenninal is located.

In an article to introduce 
new users to the UNIXsys-

ulty member Gene Spafford 
described the maincomputer 
user categories: 

• "compO - topics of in-
terestto both computer pro-
fessionals and hobbyists, in-

science, software source, 
and information on hardware 
and software systems 

For more widespread distribu-
tion, a user can instruct the com-
pUler 10 send the article every-
where in California, everywhere 
in the United States, everywhere 
in North America, or everywhere 
in the world covered by USENET. 
Areas that are part of USENET's

portions of Europe and Japan.

nations, which are an integral part 
of face-to-face exchange. 

In the past, certain statements 
intended as jokes were misinter-

as IMHO ("in my humble opin-

politeness to statements. 

tact. "A large fraction of my social 
interaction is now with people a 
thousand miles away through the 
computers," he said. "The com-
puters are not de-personalizing us. 
They're giving us more contact 
with people. We're using the com-
puters as a mechanism to increase 
our personal contact." 

"It all boils down to people," he 
continued. "We're moving towards 
a global village kind of environ-
ment where · people can talk to 
people a lot easier than they would

That's the trend. The world is defi-

• ·soc· - groups primar-
ily addressing social issues 
and socializing 

• "talk" - groups largely 
debate-oriented and tending 
to feature long discussions 
without resolution and with-
out appreciable amounts of 
generally useful information 

Computer engineering major 
Jack Arnold Jr. feels likewise. 

Arnold is attracted to the net-
work because it allows him to 
pursue two interests simultane-
ously. "I'm interested in comput-
ers; I like using them," he said. "I 
like networking because I'm also 
interested in people, so this is per-
fect. I think it's very valuable to 

These facts and olhers have 
prompted many people to exam-
ine the implications of this form 
of communication. 

To Bloch, the network serves as 
an important means of social con-

"There is a definite human ele-
ment in it," said Arnold, a Warren 
junior. "This is all about human 
communication. Overall, all that is 
going on and all that can go on is to 
help people communicate with 
people more effectively. See LINK, page 10

have such a fast and open mode to 
communicate with people. The 
computer goes a long way towards 
achieving that kind of openness." 

Networks unite many different 
perspectives, and there is an p0-
tential for argument and conflict. 

As Bloch explained, "if some-
body posts some sort of article that 
you disagree with strongly, you 
get all hot and bothered and sit 
down with your fingers flying and 
smoke coming out of the keyboard 
and you fire off this nasty message 
casting aspersions upon the 
person's ancestry. 

"This person, of course, gets 
equall y hot and bothered and sends 
off something even more incendi-
ary to you, and everybody else in 
the world is starting to get really 
sick of both of you becau e they

don't want to read your personal 
quarrel all the time," he said. 

This situation has a name in 
USENET language: "flaming." 
When it arises, others in the 
newsgroup in which the argument 
originated usually request that the 
two dissenting opinion-holders 
take their debate into the personal 
mail division. Such person-ta-per-
son transmission is known on the 
system as electronic mail, or "E-
mail. " 

According to Arnold, the com-
puter network is "significant, but 
it's not a wonder of the world."

"People think of it as a very 
novel thing, and after a while, you 
realize that it's not. It 's just a 
machine, just a tool," he contin-
ued "It has its place. It's not 
something to get obsessed over, 
and I think that a lot of people get 
obsessed over it." 

Sophomore Mark Rotenberg, 
a computer science major, agrees 
that the computer provides a sig-
nificant avenue of communication 
across the miles. But, unlike Ar-
nold and Bloch, he finds that the 
computers are "much more imper-
sonal," and prefers "talking face-
to-face with people." 

In Rotenberg's view, comput-
ers lead to decreased personal inter-
action, yet further the idea of a 
global village: "Computers make 
the world more personal, but they 
make communication less personal 
because it's over a farther dis-
tance."

Tritons Control West Region's Top-Ranked Team and UCSC 

Menlo Goes Down; UCSD 13-4 

Brla. Morrl5/0uardian 
Junior guard Tim Rapp's 30 points helped the Tritons chew up Menlo College, 77-67, on Saturday night in the Main Gymnasium. 

By KEVIN TWER 
Contributing Writer 

When the latest rankings in 
men's Division III basketball are 
released later this week, don' t 'be 
surprised to see a familiar team 
listed atop West Region. 

The UCSD men 's basketball 
team capped off a busy weekend of 
play by downing Menlo College, 
77-67, Saturday night in the Main 
Gym. The defeat avenged an ear-
lier season loss to the Oaks, and 
greatly improved the Tritons ' post-
season hopes as well. 

Menlo had previously been 
ranked number one in the West 
while the Tritons held the number 
two spot. 

"This win did wonders for us," 
UCSD Head Coach Tom Marshall 
said. "We came in as numJ>er two, 
and beat the team ahead of us. We 
should move up to number one in 
the West." Marshall said he was 
also hoping for a showing in the 
national rankings. 

The Tritons warmed up for 
Menlo by defeating UC Santa Cruz 
on Friday night, 81 -60 .. The key to 
the game for both teams was shoot-
ing. While UCSD made over 50 
percent of its attempts from the 
field, Santa Cruz shot a "sluggish" 
37 percent, according to Marshall. 
Junior guard Tom Shawcroft led 
both teams in scoring with 14 
points, as every player who saw 
action put numbers up on the board. 

The UC Santa Cruz game also 
gave the Tritons a chance to prac-
tice both offensive and defensive 
strategies which they intended to

Both teams started the season 
with 1-3 records. 

Both teams turned things 
around. not only crossing. but 
virtually hurdling the .500 bar-
rier. 

Both teams brought consecu-
tive win streaks into theCal State

atsix, CSUSB's at 11. 

But it was the Coyotes who 
emerged with their win streak 
mt.:t, running their record to 
13-3 with a 86-79 victory. UCSD 
feD abort in its pursuit of the 
school record of 10 consecutive 
wins, as its rivals halted a win 
stmIk for the second year in a 
row. 

The Tritons doWned CSUSB 
91-74 last season to break the 
previous record of seven, but tbe 
Coyotes later ended UCSOt • 
record streak with m 80-74 win. 

Friday night, UCSD trailed 
by silt at halftime, 43-37, but 
fought back to within two at 70-
68 with 5:54 remaining. 

The com~back effort fell 
short, as the Coyotes chewed up'

deficit to the final seven points.

Men's Lacrosse Kicks Ofr 
'90 By Kicking Pepperdine 

Preview: 1990 Success Rides With the Triton Offense 
By PETER KO 
Contributing Writer 

Two years ago, the Pepperdine 
Waves defeated UCSD by a single 
goal. 

What a difference a couple of 
years can make. 

Saturday afternoon at Pryatel 
Field, the Division I Tritons thor-
oughly dominated Pepperdine in a 
season-opening 16-6 thrashing. 
And it wasn' t even that close. 

Rima UzairblGuardian 

The addition of Steve Gross-
man on the front line could help 
bolster the Triton offense. 

Yesterday afternoon, UCSD ran 
its record to 2-0 by knocking off 
Occidental College, 11 -6_ 

In Saturday's opener, midfielder 
Juan Millan opened the Triton 
scoring deluge in the first quarter 
with a shot that bounced in front 
of, and then over, Pepperdine goalie 
Alex Diener. 

Back-to-back goals, separated 
by less than thirty seconds, gave 
the Tritons a 3-0 lead. But the 
Waves, down 4-1 , were still within 
reach at the conclusion of the first 
quarter. 

Then the roof caved in. 
A seven goal explosion in the 

second quarter was teyed by Brad 
Bunten's rifle shot past Diener off 
a pass from Millan, who took the 
opening face-off and made a bro-
ken field run through the Waves ' 
defense. After UCSD opened up 
an 11 -2 advantage, any doubtto the 
eventual outcome was erased. 

The second half presented an 
opportunity for the Tritons to tee-
off and practice their checking and 
shooting. Diener was peppered 
with countless shots, and at one 
point was heard to scream, "I need 
some help, here!" 

Millan, ajunior,led UCSDwith 

three goals, while Bunten and Sven 
Hainey each added two. 

On defense, the Tritons com-
pletely shut down a listless Pep-
perdine offense which at times 
seemed almost reluctant to take 
any shots. 

The Tritons even did their best . 
to keep the Waves interested when 
a loose ball bounced off a UCSD 
defender and into the goal after 
Triton goalie Tony Prestigiacomo 
was caught out of position. 

It would be one of the few 
mistakes in a nearly flawless per-
formance by Prestigiacomo, who 
allowed only two goals in three 
quarters of play. Four Pepperdine 
goals late in the fourth quarte, 
when the outcome was already 
decided, closed out the scoring. 

In yesterday 's Occidental con-
test, the Tritons fell behind 2-0 
early but rebounded with five 
straight goals and wound up win-
ning by a conv incing 11-6 score. 

According to Millan , who 
scored three goals and added a 
couple of assists, the tearn did not 
playas well as it should have 
against Occidental. 

These were the first games for

employ against Menlo. 

Against the Oaks, sophomore 
~Ick Batt's lay-up with 16:50 
remaining in the first half gave 
UCSD its first lead. The Tritons 
never looked back. They domi-
nated the first half, holding the 
Oaks to only 27 points. 

Coach Marshall substituted 
frequently in the first half, and was 
especially pleased by the jobs 
turned in by reserves Peter Selleck, 
Chris Moore, and Joe Lindsay. 

Just before halftime, UCSD 
utilized a zone defense for the first 
time in the game. 

" I just wanted to show them the 
zone. Give 'em something to think 
about besides what we were doing 
effectively," Marshall said 

What the Tritons were doing 
extremely well was helping out on 
defense. Only on rare occasions 
was the ball passed inside to a 
Menlo player without a blanket of 
gold jerseys immediately surround-
ing him. 

With 22 seconds remaining in 
the first half, a Lindsay lay-up gave 
the Tritons a 46-27 advantage 
which they carried into the locker 
room. During halftime. Marshall 
gave his players a talk that later 
proved to be crucial to the game's 
outcome. 

"I told them that [Menlo J would 
make a run. That they were too 
good a team to just lay down and 
play dead." 

Although they began the sec-

ond half without guard Sabre 
Bowden who had picked up four 
personal fouls in the first half, the 
Oaks refused to quit. Forward Ken 
Boldt, who, according to Marshall, 
"is a trong player," picked up the 
slack. 

Boldt opened the second half 
scoring with five unanswered 
points. Menlo continued 10 chip 
away atthe lead, and with just over 
five mi nutes remaining in the game, 
an Oaks ' bucket cut the lead to 
seven. 

But the Tritons were prepared 
forthesurge. In teadofpanicking, 
they rebuilt a commanding lead 
riding on the play of junior guard 
Tim Rapp and Batt. Rapp finished. 
with a game-high 30 points, while 
Batt and junior forward Gordon 
McNeill each chipped in 14. Boldt 
led the Oaks with 27. 

On Tuesday, UCSD travels to 
Occidental College to take on the 
Tigers. Tip-off is at 7 p.m.

Baseball salarie have alway

Most of them nailed it. Blew it

When Oakland's Rickey Hen-

shocked. Granted, the guy is good, 
and his exploits were an instru-

Intercollegiate Update ..• 
Men's Swimming 

The Triton men's swimmers 
took care of Claremont College in 
a road meet on Friday, but did not 
quite match up with Cal State Bak-
ersfield and UC Berkeley the fol-
lowing day. 

Though UCSD did not add any 
individuals to its current list of 
seven who have qualified for the 
Division ill Nationals, four Triton 
swimmers in five events managed 
to put forth their best times of the 
year in Saturday's meet. 

Brad Thomas posted his best 

times of the year in both the 500 
and 200-yard freestyle (he finished 
fourth overall in the latter), Pete 
Smith's 9:58 finish in the 1000 
free was his best, as was Chris 
Carillo's time of 9:56 in the same 
event, and Don Robertson swam 
his fastest time in the 200 fly at 
I :58, one second off the national 
time standard. 

The UCSD 400 freestyle relay 
team also recorded its best time of 
the year, with a 3:10.04 clocking. 

The men will compete at USC 
next Saturday, with the women 
heading to Pepperdine. 

Fencing 
The 8-2 Tritons are currently 

ranked second in the conference, 
and will face third-ranked UC Santa 
Barbara and Cal Poly Pomona in 
their last home match of the season 
Saturday afternoon in the Price 
Center Ballroom. The San Diego 
Fencing Club will also compete. 

Tne Tritons need to hold off 
UCSB (7-3) to maintain their 
number two ranking. 

Long Beach State remains atop 
the conference with a perfect 10-0 
record. 

JC tramural Xtras ... 
Rugby 

The Triton rugby team fell 
to powerful Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo, 36-12, in its first offi-
cial game of the '90 campaign 
yesterday on the road. 

UCSD, which is competing 
on the University Level for the 
first time (they played on the 
College Level last year), ran 
out of gas-giving up 12 points 
- in the last six or seven min-
utes of the game, according to 
Head Coach Tom Butler. 

The Tritons host UCSB next 
Saturday at I p.m.

Monday, January 22,1990 The UCSD Guardian 

M.LAX 
Continued from page 15 

is one aspect of the team he would PHILLER 
like to see improve. 

"Our offense hasn't been that Continued from page 17 
UCSD at the Division I level after 
last season's 11-0 record and sec-
ond round loss in the playoffs to 
the eventual Westem champion, 
Whittier. 

The raise in competition level 
means a tougher schedule for the 
Tritons. Still, Head Coach Bruce 
Seitz is optimistic about the up-
coming season. 

"I expect we' ll make the play-
offs," Seitz said. 

Before the Pepperdine match, 
Seitz said his goals for the team 
were to "control the game and test 
our offense against [Pepperdinel." 

According to Seitz, the offense 

strong in recenfyears. Our offense 
scored a lot of points last year 
because the defense was so strong." 

To bolster the offense. Seitz 
plucked team captain Haynie out 
of the defense and has switched 
him to an attacker position. Among 
those joining Haynie on the front 
line will be newcomer Steve Gross-
man. 

The midfield is expected to be 
led by veterans Millan and Bunten. 

The defense will be keyed by 
Prestigiacomo, who is replacing 
last year's starter, Joe Brown. 

UCSD will face UC Santa Bar-
bara next weekend on the road. 

RImu UllirllJGuanIian 
Juan Millan helped lead a Triton scoring assault which produced 
27 goals this weekend against Pepperdine and Occidental. 

hospital cases who need the money 
to cover their medical bills: Paul 
Molitor ($3.25 million), Ted 
Higuera ($2.3 million), and Dickie 
Thon ($1 .2 miUion). The sad thing 
is, many of the clubs offer the 
players darn close to what they ask 
for. 

Bo Jackson has made perhaps 
the most unusual arbitration re-
quest: he wants $1,900,00 I, which 
is one dollar more than what Sierra 
wants. Personal vendetta, or what? 
This is getting ridiculous. 

If anybody is going to make 
that kind of money, at least they 
should be players like Henderson, 
Langston, Mitchell, and Stewart. 
But when somebody like Mark 
Davis, now a Kansas City relief 
pitcher, asks for upwards of three 
million and gets it. things are get-
ling just a bit crazy. 

Mark Davis is good, sure, and 
without him the Padres would have 
finished well out of contention in 
the NationaI League West last year. 
But he's a relie/pitcher. Most of 
the best closers in baseball only 
need to pitch an average of three 
innings a week to do their job ef-
fectively. They do not deserve to 
be millionaires. 

John Franco, a Mets reliever, is 
asking for $2.475 million. Tom 
Henke of the Blue Jays is request-
ing $2.4 million. Greg Minton, 
OregMinton, wants $ 1.1 5 million. 
Greg Minton?

HOMY & HILLBIWES - Ment • AA lasketball 
Who says great basketball can't come from the Greal Northwest? 

Certainly not the teams in Men's AA Basketball. Hailing from Idaho, 
Montana, and various truckstops across northern California, Homy &. 
Hillbillies are now 2-0 in Wednesday night's Gator League. 

Having beaten Phi Slappa Boarda 45-38 in their home opener, Horny 
&< Hillbillies stomped on Abe VigodD's Scrotum last Wednesday 55-43. 
(By the way, Abe is resting comfortably now, although his plans to 
start a family have been pushed back a few years.) 

The Hillbillies, playing without Horny (a.l<.a. Gregg Meyer) who is 
on injured reserve, took it to Scrotum early on, striding out to a 
comfortable 24-15 lead at halftime. From there, Darin Wright and 
Brock Weaver took over, hitting shot after shot from the outside and 
dishing off to the big men when necessary. 

This is their first year playing together, and these good 01' boys are 
always looking for new talent. All they ask is that you play the game 
with all your heart. come from a town with at least one (but not more 
than three) gas stations, and have a genuine fondness for potatoes. 

Welcome to the big dty, boys. Here's one to write home to Ma and 
Paabout.
