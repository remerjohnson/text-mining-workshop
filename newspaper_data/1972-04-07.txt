Ralph Staver, apartments built in the past? 

As voter registration for the 
June 6 California Primary 
enters its last week. rumors 
have begun to circulate 
concerning the validity of 
students registering at their 
college address. Because of the 
heavy Democratic registration 
of 18-20 year olds then' have 
been rumors that the 
Republican Party intends to 
challenge the registrations of 
college students at the polling 
places on Primarv dav, 

One of the issues at stake in 
this election is that of housing : 
the city's zoning policies. 
height limitations. rent ceilings 
and low-income housing for the 
cIty s student population. Part 
of the zoning controversey 
involves what are termed R-l 
and R·3 areas. R'1 designates a 
zone where only single family 
dwellings are permitted . An R-
3 zone permits commercial or 
reSIdential dwellings of up to 
three tories. 

The TRITON TIMES in a 
rec nt interview with 
Councilmen Dick Rypinski and 
Ralph Staver discussed these 

hou ~tng Issues.

CouncIlman DIck Rypinski

Dcl ~ar Ci ty Council. Rypinski

RypiBsIIi : "These limits 
would have prevented a couple 
of b u i ld i ng s a l r ea d y

have cut-off ocean view." 

Tr: How would the city 
house prospective new renters? 

RypiDlki : " I would like to 
see us move to vertical zoning 
in our downtown area , Under a 
vert ica l planning plan . 
businesses would be on the 
ground floor. apartments on 
the second floor ." 

Interview with Staver 
Ralph Staver has served one 

(our'vear term on the council 
He 'considers his principle 
accomplishment to be his 
authorship of the ci ty 's

Tr: Why did vou oppose the 
move to restnct or halt new

Staver: For two rea ons. 
First. I 0Ppo ed it because J

Staver: ,·It can't do it the 
way it has in the past. Many 
students now live in R-l single 
fa mily type houses, I am 
concerned about the over-
crowding there already. Since 
almost all of the sites available 
for those kind of apartments 
are already occupied. we must 
allow R-3 areas to develop to 
provide new housing. " 

Tr: Are you saying that the 
owners of the R-l apartments 
have something to gain by 
stopping the construction of 
new apartments? 

Staver: "The stopping of R-3 
apartments. by eliminating 
poSSIble competition. would 
certamly tend to maXimIze the 
profit s o( the present 
apartment owners ."

Challenges at PoJl Legal 
County Registrar of Voters 

Charles Sexton savs that 
challenges of voters at the polls 
are legal. but only under strict 
regulations , The principle 
grounds (or challenge are 
evidence that the person IS not 
who he claims to be or that he 
does not reside at the address 
he reported on his affidavit. 
But Sexton emphaSIzed that 
although any voter mav 
challenge another voter there 
must be " probable cause" 
before an electIOn official may 
investigate the challenge. in 
the event of a challenge the 
precinct worker WIll ask the 
voter to affi rm tha t the 
statement made on the 
onglnal affidaVIt are true If 
th voter so affirm he WIll be 
allowed to vote WIthout further 
delav exton savs that If there 
IS ubsequent eVIdence of

Radical Republicans Organize on Campus 
"We are not freaking on God. mother and country, .. , Our 

purpose is a positive reordering of American political 
priorities." So said Phil Catalfo. press secretary for UCSD's 
Radical Republicans. The organization, consisting of nine 
members at present. is about to launch a voter registration and 
membership drive on campus. Integral to this drive is the 
group 's endorsement and support of Michael Palcic's 
campaign for the Republican nomination to the 80th Assembly 
distriCt. 

Catalfo feels . would be giving Palcic publiCity wh,,:h he and the 
Radical Republicans need 

The 80th Assembly district included according to Catalfo. 
84,000 registered Republicans. A 40 to 50 per cent turnout IS 
expected for the June 6 priman·. meaning 35 to 40 thousand 
voters. Stull won approximately 70 per cent of the vote In hiS 
last electIOn , The Radical Republicans feel that given the 
relatively small number of potential votes. they can Win a 
considerable number of votes - maybe 20 to 30 per cent 

Catalfo feels the ~outh vote wll! be significant In future 
changes in politics. however at pres nt not enough students are 
registering to vote or becoming involved In politiCS , He feel s 
that orgamzations such as the Radical Republicans. if begun 
now can demonstrate to new. youn~ voters that they can exert 
a political influence In a local context now 

The membership and voter registration drive will kick off on 
Saturday night in Revel1e Cafeteria with a "multiple 
happening. " Beginning at 8 p m, there will be a speech 
inlroducing the Radical Republican organization and their 
platform, a dance, a question and answer session followed by a 
party, Deputy registrars will be available all evening . 

Wednesday evening Mike Palcie will talk concerning his 
candidacy in Revelle Cafeteria. Both Wednesday and Thursday 

dcput~ registrars will be available on all three college 
campuses. 

According to Mike Palcic. the Radical Republicns was 
organized to avoid erroneous labeling b~ the media , Everyone 
seems to be labeled these day. Palclc said, so it would be 
more accurate if we labeled ourselves. Phil Cata lfo said the 
Radical Republicans was formed to work with th existing 
power organization in San Diego, San Diego is controlled by the 
Republican party. he said . and In order to gain first hand 
political knowledge one must "live IO side the belly of the 
whale" for a short time. 

Catalfo sa id he is hoping that the Radical RepUblicans and 
Palclc. through their platforms will provoke a response from 
John tull. the Republicans incumbent lor the 80th Assembly 
distriCt. to the issues they raise . As vel. Ca talfo said. Stull has 
not even respond d to Palclc 's ca ndldac~ or to the Issues he 
and the Radical Republicans have raised. Any response . 

Here it is, the first of the 
year You 've got those 
old Spring-Quarter-
Where-Am -I-Going-To-
Uve?-blues. That place 
you've got now is falling 

apart at the beams . If you have to lislen 10

Look at it this way: If you and a friend go in on a

And let the warmth of eternal

Certainly the ceiling of sor·

Will crumble amidst the soft

This joyousness, to reign

The mood that will prevail if 
I have you in reach. 
No doubt the windows of

Will melt to unify the outside 
with my soul , 
This feal, breaking the locks

The mood that will prevail if 
I have you in whole .

Oh please melt and crumble

Open Theatre To Appear 

I 

This Sunday evening at 8 p.m ., tbe 
famous New York City Off-Broadway 
Open Theatre will appear in 
performance at tbe Revelle Cafeteria. 

Walter Kerr of tbe NEW YORK 
TIMES has lauded the experimental 
theatre group by saying: "Tbere is no 
need to reach out and touch the actor ... 
their physical presences someho~ 
reflect our physical pre ences." 

This performance of the Open Theatre 
is sponsored by tbe Campus-Wide 
Programming Board in conjunction with 
the Anomaly Factory . Tickets are SI for 
UCSD students and S2 for others wanting 
to attend. 

The Theatre's repertoire thu s tar has 
consisted of plays entitled . Endgame. 
'I he erpent. Termtnal and The 

Mutation how : all plays that deal with 
subjeets elemental as Adam and Eve in 
the garden, birth and rebirth, and the 
metamorphoses of people . 

The Open Theatrels attempt to change 
the conventional theatre/ theatregoer 
arrangement thai confines many actors 
and spectators , is somewhat analagou 
to the Anomaly Factory's endeavors al 
UCSD to change tbe convention~ of 
"Theatre. " 

The performance will undoubtedly 
prove to be interesting, aDd for those of 
vou who dislike the normal dichotem \ 

bet~een pectator and artor, the 
performance mi~ht well be tne most 
exciting theatre experience you 'wever

CSI On Pollution 
Michael Kristy 

Research Consultant 
Campus Studies Institute 

In a recent letter to the TRITON TIMES (March 28, 1972). 
Mr. Robert C Ildwell scolded the Campus Studies Institute for 
supposedly iglloring the dangers of pollution and for misrepre-
senting pertinent facts. Mr. Caldwell seems to have entirely 
misread CSI's recent mailing on pollution. 

In this mailing CSI tried to make clear two points. The first is 
that responsible people differ regarding the extent and dangers 
of the current level of pollution : there is no true consensus on 
the issue. The second point is that calling for government inter-
vention IS necessanly equivalent to calling for the restriction 
of liberties - not onlv of those " liberties" which harm the 
society. but also of those healthy liberties on which the vitality 
of the creative society depends. 

An examination of a few of Mr. CaldweIrs remarks may be 
In order here. 

Mr. Caldwell tates that " CSI reaches the height of 
ignorance to say that damage from the Santa Barbara oil spill 
was ·nil. If any ' ., CSI did not say that

' 
The quote was clearly 

att ributed to the LO ANGELES TIMES' WEST Magazine of 
June 6. 1971 - and the particular quote was made by Dr. 
Wheeler North. professor of environmental science at Caltech. 
CSI used that quote to complement several others. one of which 
claimed that " the anta Barbara Channel IS 'a sea gone dead ' 
.. What CSI thereby Illustrated IS the dlverslly of opinIOn on the 
ubject 
:vir Caldwell also makes some dramatic statements which 

he neglect to substantiate He mentions that "thousands of 
sea ls I yes. " thousands' , were washed up on the beaches near 
Santa Barbara. Thi S I an Impres Ive and startling figure 
which Mr Ca ldwell attributes to no one He also says that 
" two or three person die a a direct re ult of air poliutant 
each day that a mog alert IS declared In Los Angeles .. Again. 
no venflcatlon . 

Mr Caldwell IS certamly entitled to the opInion that the e 
statements are true . CSI merelv howed that others disagree 
con Iderablv with the sort of statements that ~Ir Caldwell has 
made There IS . to say It once agam. no can en u on the i ue. 

Mr Caldwell argue that 'one of the funcllon of 
government is Indeed to restnct personal Itbertles . . From the 
context one gathers that by thiS he means that the government 
may re tram one person from Infrmglng upon another 's nghts 
There IS no argument here . But :'Ifr Caldwell fails to make the 
logical inference. namelv If Ihe government can restrict 
"bad ' freedoms. It can abo r lrIct " good " ones. and 
eventually It will restrict the "good" freedoms One need onl:-
refer to the most celebrated example of government-gone-
mad ' Prohibition 

The trouble With government IS that once It gets large. It gets 
larger The essence of government IS power. and power always 
means power over mdlvlduals. As that power mcreases. there 
IS the tendency that it wm bused mcrea Ingly flagrantly and 
unwisely One IS remmded of Lord Acton 's dictum ' " Power 
tends to corrupt. and absolute power corrupts absolutely." 
Government restrictIOns are easy to impose . but they are very 
difficult to remove The danger IS that fooli sh restrictIOns will 
be Imposed and not removed unltllt IS too late 

Mr. Caldwell realizes that something must be done : "The 
wisest solulton IS to start now. before widespread damage 
occurs. to alleviate these areas of cri is and restore the 
ecological balance and function of the world ." The question IS : 
By what means is thiS to be done? Should it be done through 
government interventIOn or through the free market? Let us 
conSider an example. 

Assume that an emiSSIOn-free automobile could be put on the 
market Immedlatelv at onlv one hundred dollars above the 
present ca r prices. Would the car manufacturers produce such 
a vehicle? The answer. of course. IS that anvone Interested in 
cornering a market (a nd surely Detroit ' IS interested in 
boosting sales ) would be interested in being the first to market 
a pollution-free vehicle . The first manufacturer to offer such a 
ca r would Increase his sa les tremendously. Thus. if such a car 
could be put on the market now. it would be there - because it 
IS m the manufacturers ' Interests to have It there Government 
mtervention In the field would actuallv be unnecessary because 
the auto makers would actuallv be anxlou to be first to 
produce such a car. ' . 

And why would they want to produce polluhon-free cars? 
Because they realize that the public wants them. And wh!, does 
the public want such ca rs? Because the public has been made 
aware of the need for them by pnvate mdlvlduals workmg 
together voluntanly on behalf of anti-pollutIOn The 
government did not make the peol'le aware of the pollution 
hazards. the voluntary efforts of creative individuals did . 

But. Mr Caldwell mdlrectlv Implies. the free market has not 
vet solved Ihe pollullon problems~ True . But it IS not enough to 
sav that t~ ~ private sector has not vet completelv removed 
pollulton \ hat must be proven. be\'ond a . reasonable dOUbt ." 
It that thl public sector - the government - can do a 
demonstra )Iv better Job So far thiS proof has not been 
produced dnd thousands of lears of expenence with 
governmer t tn tervenllon indicate that II probably will never be 
produced 

CS I cert ,101, supports studies Into the cau.~s. rz~ults. and

Poge B T rilon Time$ Friday, April 7, 1972 

Students at UCSD may have long wondered how Paul 
Kaufman has managed to combine within himself a glaring 
inefficiency at admini tering the AS government with a total 
inability to maintain his credibility with the studem 
population. Surely, many must have thought in recent months. 
no one could do 0 bungling a job. 

We are now able to reveal. on the basis of newly obtained 
Information, the cause of this peculiar contradiction. This 
truth will prove uncomfortable to many - orne. indeed may 
refuse to believe It. We have no " magical" device for proving 
our case. particularly as our sources - including individuals 
close to the AS administration - have asked not to be named. 
Thus. we can appeal only to logic . We intend to demonstrate 
that te " inefficiency" of the Kaufman regime IS in fact quite 
deliberate : temming from a program drawn up between 
Kaufman and members of the DIME SION group late last 
yea r 

Kaufman-Sills-Keating Collusion? 
On the face of things. collUSIOn betw!'en Kaufman a nd the 

Sill-Keating axis seems. we admit . inherently improbable. But 
this . of course. is precisely wh:< it has worked so well When 
one searches for conspiracies. one sca rcely begins with sworn 
enemie . If atan wished to destro~' the Church. he would begin 
with the Pope. . 

Graffitlt last :-ea r accused Keallng of being a "nght-wmg 
Ylppie" In hiS tactics: which IS actuall~' only an Indirect and 
perjorative way of saying that he wa s uSing the effective 
methods of achieving his ends - methods of fraud . farce. and 

publiclt~ Just how efftcient these methods were we have only 
now begun to learn . Keating and Si ll have mad an elaborate 
show of being Kaufman 's enemies. even though. in point of 
lact, Kaufman was their confederate working as a "double 
agent" to demolt h the AS. 

Earlv In his AS ca reer . Kaufman found that he had enemies 
In the AS and admi nistration who were both able and willing to 
thwart hiS ambitions. Even when his successful campaign for 
PreSident was well under wa y. he learned that there were 
those who would prevent him from fully cxerci ing his power 
and impoSing hi own will and personalitv on the AS . And like 
the ambitiOUS generals of ancient Rome. he was not above 
callmg In the outer barbanans to destroy an institution he

led him . naturally ·enough. to DIME~SIO and Its covey of 
campus reactIOnaries Although personally repelled by their 
ideologies. he was willi ng to ally with them to gam the 
de tructlon of his pnvate Poland 

Secret Plan 
So. late last year . a strange and very secret plan began to 

take form Keating knew that he had no hope of winning. But 
when Kaufman approached him with hiS proposal. he !lnd his 
conservative friends leaped at an opportunity which they could 
never expect again Meetings were held lat off-campus 
locations where no one would be treated to the unusual 
spectacle of mortal enem ies whispering secrets in one 
anothers' ears) and plans were drawn up. Dave Shaw. though 
himself never informed of the remarkable plot. was convinced 
by members of the Cabal to run for preSident himself. setting 
the stage for the dubious conditions under which Kaufman was 
raised to the presidency. A co-ordination system was set up to 
insure that DIMENSION would always know just what to 
attack Kaufman about - in an elaborate mock-battle which 
Kaufman would always lose. The election itself came and 
went. and when it was donE:. Kau fman was in the driver 's seat. 
having come to power by a tnck m which the actual choice of 
the students was dropped OUI of Sight. He immediately drove 
of[ the nearest availa ble cli ff . a procedure which he repeats at 
everv chance. 

Th'e best si ngle example of thiS tnckery is the famous Coast 
Cruiser fi asco. A plan was drawn up by Kaufman to procure a 
London bus for thi s little-used svstem . a bus to be obtained at 
enormous cost. It may have occ'urred to orne - as it certainly 
occurred to one of the present writers when he wrote his 
original AS article - that no ordinarv ineffiCiency could 
explain thiS incredible project. Observe that the whole affair 
was ideally designed to provide DIMENSION with a handle for 
anti-AS propaganda . Indeed. it was onginally devised by 
Kaufman and Sills while their creative powers were being 
artificially enhanced Ilhrough the agency of a certain 
familiar herb l at one of DIMENSION 'S little-known orgies for 
staff members. Seldom has debauchery borne such vast fruit. 
The bright. red vehicle which they intended to purchase 
produced such a stink that eventua lly the business was quashed 
at the behest of the Chancellor . :-';othlng could have done more 
to destroy AS credibility ITo quot Ayn Rand : "They say that

there is a credibility gap : they do not say that someone is 
lying!! ) 

Those who recall the rather fruitless and chaotic "debate" 
among the candidates lasl year may now realize that it never 
stood much of a chance . dragged down as it was by the 
collusion of Kaufman and Keating. the lesser plots of Shaw and 
Bayliss. and Diddo Clark's general im plau ibility. That debate 
did much to discredit the AS : now we know why. It was truly a 
master stroke in Kaufman 's and Keating 's now-revealed 
cherne. 

How did this plot. so carefully hidden . finally come to light. 
Some of us. of cour e. have long been su picious of AS 
operations and motives. but even we would never have dared 
conceive such comprehensive machinations. And . indeed. the 
participation of the DIMENSIO~ group in the plot was double 
effective . si nce all assumed that they were bitter foes of 
Kaufman and all his works. It simply' seemed peculiar that 
anyone could be so much a parody of him elf as was Kaufman. 
Some also wondered that Keating and Sills. for all their 
opposition. never touched on any really substantive issues. 
Think " . 

Student Provides First Break 
The first break came when a student emplo~'ed by the food 

ervices overheard Kaufman mumbling about the plot in hi 
sleep. Reacti ng with stunned disbelief. she looked through his 
papers and found everal letters from Keating. hocked. he 
came to us I as the only members of the "opposition " not 
implicated in the plot If elf) and revealed as much of the story 
as she knew to us . We were at first unwtlling to believe a tale so 
inherently improbable. but it eemed impossible that she could 
have fabncated . without an.l· Visible motive. so outrageous a 
tale . 

Partial confirmat ion was obtained when Kevin Olson. his 
cri tical faculties partially dulled b.I' drink and fatigue. was 
persuaded to reveal a number of details . In particular . he 
described as much as he could remember of the secret 
meetings he had attended last vear in the Pussv Cat theatre 
downtown. and. deluded bv our outward show of a'dmiration for 
the skill he and the others had hown. went so far as to revel 
the existence of a secret correspondence between those 
involved - a correspondence which a Po t Office worker later 
confirmed as having occurred. Finally. we talked to the 
custodians and so discovered that AS offices were then being 
cleaned out. This gave us an opportunity to earch those files 
being thrown out - files in which Kaufman ketched out man V 
of hi plans. . 

This is not a comfortable discovery. ince most people have a 
deeply ingramed fear of conspiracies. Many will refuse to 
believe that uch a conspiracy exists. hoping to keep these 
pent-up fears repressed. They 11'111 read with relief the 
denunciations by the accused. and perhaps even believe them. 
forgetting tha t the gUilty parties are scarcely likely to confess, 
or even permit a silence which would im ply guilt. We. too 
would like to believe them . but the evidence is too strong to be 
ignored . Knowing the facts . we have no choice but to reveal 
them to the public. As Jesus said. " Everyone that doeth evil 
hateth the light" .

reSIgns post 
Mike Roth 

Barry Cunnmgham. varsity basketball coach of the Tritons 
for the past three year , resigned Wednesday tu assume fut!-
time teaching responsibilities in the CSD Department of 
PhYSical Education. 

The reason for the deci sion, according to Cunningham. was a 
"difference in philo ophy relating to the goals and conduct of 
the athletic program at UCSD." When asked to elaborate on 
thiS difference for the TRITON TIMES. he commented , "] 
wanted to ee a raise in the level of competit ion . possibly 
competing on the :\'CAA college level In the future ." Coach 
Cunningham also said that h wa interested in acllvelv 
recruiting tudent-athletes from jumor colleges and high 
schools. Intercollegiate competition at UCSD IS strictlv on a 
"deSire to play" basis. a the San Diego campus offers no 
athletic scholar hips of any type and no academic credit is 
given for phy Ical educatIOn. Accordmg to coach Cu nningham . 
the athlete must approach the athletic department first before 
anything IS done 

Under Cunmngham 's direction the UC 0 Triton have 
compiled a 13 wm . 13 los record dunng the past season. 
The three-year record under Cunnmgham was 40 WinS and 39 
losses. The coach mentIOned that he has nothmg but the highest 
re pect for the student·athletes who played ba ketball for him. 
and that he was dl appolOted m not being able to coach next 
year 's team. which he says potentl~ll¥ may be one of the finest 
basketball teams 10 L'CSD hi ton . You couldn 't ask for a 
fmer group of young men " 

When a ked about future plans. Cunmngham said he has not 
decld d for sure whether he WIt! remam at UCSD a a ph:; Ical 
educatIOn Instructor or take a coachmg po ilIOn Isewhere. He 
said he Will look further Into the matter durmg th Spflng
