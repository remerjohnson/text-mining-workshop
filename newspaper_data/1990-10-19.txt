Co-ops Ready 
To Sign Lease 
By Mary Betty Heard 
Associate News Editor 

After over two years of deliberation and countless failed 
leases, the UCSD co-ops may sign a lease with the University 
Center Board (UCB) 00 Monday . 

The UCB meeting, which is open to the public, will be held 
Monday night at 5:30 p.m. in the Student Leadership Chambers 
on the third floor of the Price Center. 

The basic framework of the new lease, according to UCB 
Chair Nick Long, is the same as old proposed leases, with certain 
changes. For example, the lease proposed on Feb. 12 stated that 
the co-ops would provide their own keys for their doors. 

'''The difference [between previous leases and the new one] 
was that the February 12 specified a 'key clause' which left the 
lock in the co-ops' hands, with strict rules," said Steven Dubbs, 
co-op representative to the UCB. 

'''The June 4 lease took that clause out and said that the 'key 
clause' should go to arbitration. The administration said "no," 
Dubbs said. 

Instead of dealing with the key debate, the clause has been 
omittedfrom the new lease. 

'''The reason forthat is it's now covered in the section on policy 
procedures," Long said 

According to both Long and Dubbs, the lease tales that the 
co-ops mu t follow university procedure, which refers to the use 
of university locks on the doors among other policies. 

Focxi Co-op member Greg Coleman said that the key clause 
"has become a non-issue, like a land-mine, and we never know 
when we're going to step on it." 

Both Coleman and Dubbs cited an incident which occurred 
over this summer, in which the administration changed the lock 
on co-op doors. 

' 'Groundwork. Books ... changed the locks back. The ad-
ministration re-changedthem again. Someco-opsfelttheydidn't 
have the numbers or the ability to oppose this change ... it would 
have involved court time [and] processes sometimes go on for 
over a year," Dubb said 

Dubb said that unless there is a breach of security due to the 
university locks, the co-ops probably will not change them back. 

'''The two reasons we're concerned about the key issue is 
security and autonomy," Dubb said 

The duration of the lease was also changed. 
"00 both prior leases [Februaty 12 andJtme 4], it was a three-

year lease with two-year renewals. The new lease has one-year 
renewals. The official reason was that since all other student 
organizations' space allocation leases came up yearly , [so would 
ours]. They think they're just being consistent," Dubbs said 

By setting the key precedent and by also stating that the co-
ops could only have a one-year lease, the university could be 
content with the tenns of the lease and leave it completely in the 
UCB's hands, Long said. 

"Another decision made over the swnmer was that the 
administration no longer wanted to be a part of the lease process. 
Nowthatthekeyis uehasbeensettledforthem,[theagreement] 
should be between the UCB and the co-ops. The administration 
no longer has a signature on the lease," Dubbs said. 

' ''Theleaseisnolongertobe ignedbythe[UniversityCenter 
Director] Jim Carruthers. It will be signed by me and by the UCB 
Vice Chair Paul Eykamp, and of course by the co-ops," Long

A.S. General Fund Being 
Depleted, VP Finance Says 
By Anton Bittner 
Senior Staff Writer 

A reduced general allocated fund 
paired with excessive spending have 
depleted the fund to less than 80 percent 
three weeks into Fall Quarter, according 
to A.S. Vice President-Finance Sergio 
Langarica. 

Langarica said that the original 
amountofgeneral unallocated was about 
half of what was available last year, 
while spending (eQuests continue at a 
nearly constant rate. 

' 'Last year we could afford to spend 
this money," Langaricasaid, " [but] we 
can't be as loose as we were last year." 

To illustratethealanningrateatwhich 
money is being spent, Langarica pointed 
out that the 80 percent existing in gen-
eral unallocated is the only money that 
A.S. has to spend until the fifth week of 
Spring Quarter. 

A major theme introduced by 
Langarica during council debates re-

garding the allocation of money has been 
whether or not the money i pent on 
items that are nece ary. 

"We need to cut a comer here and 
there," Langarica said, explaining some 
council actions, such as eliminating 
funding for one of the two Women's 
Resource Center delegates to a UC 
women's conference. 

The council also approved subsidiz-
ing half the cost of student tickets for 
performances to the upcoming "Cultural 
Diversity in America Theater," instead 
of fully subsidizing the tickets. 

These cuts don't seem to be enough, 
however, said Aimee Dumas, Revelle 
College senior senator and a member of 
the finance committee. 

"Everything that comes before us i a 
gocxi idea, theoretically," Dumas said, 
but there are too many requests.

Scripps Geophysics Professor 
Awarded Italian "Nobel Prize" 

J. Freeman Gilbert, a professor of Geopbysics at Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography, has been awarded the 1990 
Balzan Prize from the International Balzan Foundation of 
Milano, Italy. The Balzan 
Prize is widely considered 
the Nobel Prize for fields 
notrepresented in the Nobel 
awards. 

The prize con ists of a 
$230,000 award and a 
commendation, which will 
be presented by the presi-
dent of1taly at the Nov. 16 
award ceremony in Rome. 

Gilbert, 59, was 
awarded the prize for his 
contributions to solid earth geophysics, which have provided 
insight into the structure of the Earth's interior, and for his 
leadership role in establishing international networks of 
seismic instruments. 

Gilbert joined the Scripps faculty in 1961, and is cur-
rentlychairman of the institution's Graduate Studies Depan-
memo He served for many years as associate director of 
UCSO' branch of the University of Califomia's statewide 
Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics. His own 
research focuses on the oscillation of the Earth following 
earthquakes and how these signals can be utilized to deter-
mine the density and elastic constants in the Earth's interior. 

"Professor Gilbert' scontributions to geophysics and seis-
mic data analysis have led 10 the most accurate present 
knowledge of the earth's interior," said Dr. Edward A. 
Frieman, Scripps Institutiondirector. "This recognition from 
the Balzan Foundation serves as funher evidence of the 
important role his mathematical theories have played in 
allowing earth scientists worldwide 10 interpret a very broad 
class of geophysical phenomena." 

The Balzan Foimdation was established in 1956 for the 
purpose of recognizing the most deserving humanitarian and 
cultural work throughout the world. Past winners of the 
Balzan Prize include Pope 10hn XXIll, composer. Paul

Cancer Research Center. 

The econd annual San DiegoSun

walk, a 5-kilometer run, and a 20-
kilometer four-person relay. 1,200 
people are registered to participate. 

"Student participation last year 
made the event and we are hoping that 
we will have an even beller tum out 
this year," said Craig Sneiderman,Phi 
Delta Theta vice president. 

The bulk of the funds raised will 
comefromthe$15 entry fees charged 
forindividual participantsandthe$l50

Phi Delta TIleta President Mark

one of the biggest events on campus. Entry forms can be filled out at the 

La Jollabranch ofFirstlnterstateBank

In addition to the money which is 
donatedtotheCancerRcsearchCenter, 
the race benefits UCSD by increasing 
campus recognition, according to 
Sustel'. "[Lasl year's event was the] 
nation's second largest Greek charity 
event," he said. 

Partici pants may also register from 
6 a.m. to 7: IS a.m. on the day of the 
race. Entry fees are increased to $18 
for individual participants, $162 for

HOTEL: Resort Will Be on UC Property 
Continued from page 1 
The hotel officially broke ground in April 1990. 

A giant hole currently exists at the site, covering the 
former location of the La 1011a Farms riding stables which 
wasc10sed by the university in 1981. UCS D leased the plot 
of land to Holmes O'Brien and another developer, the 
Rag hipGroup,at$450,<XX>peryearfor55years.O'Brien 
confinned that the university wi 11 also receive a percentage 
of the hotel's gross annual income. After that point, what 
the wuversiry decides to do with the land is "up to the 
lllliversity," according to O'Brien. 

Nancy Kossan, UCSO's director of Real Estate Devel-
opment, said that the money the lllliversity receives will be 
"put back to support the mission of the university," and:hat 
she "was told that by [Vice Chancellor of Administration 
V. Wayne Kennedy]." Kossan could not elaborate on the 
statement. 

Neither Kennedy nor Chancellor Richard Atkinson, 
who were both anending yesterday 's UC Regents meeting 
at UC San Francisco, were avrulable for corrunent. 

The construction of the Ritz-Carlton makes it the fifth 
full-service hotel in the area surrounding the UCSD cam-
pus to the west, east, and south. Though both the Embassy 
Suites and Marrion Hotel have been in operation for some 
time now, the 400-room Sheraton Grande Torrey Pines, 
adjacenttotheTorreyPinesGolfCourse,andthe400-room 
Hyatt Regency at Aventine are recent additions to a city 
already dropping below the national average in hotel 
occupancy rate, according toa report intheSanDiego Union 
on Oct. 11. 

Though he did not mention any pressing need for the 
hotel, O'Brien did point out that, overalI, "the conference 
market in this area is. vety strong." 

San Diego City Senior Planner Bob Korch, who is 
connected to the planning aspect of the project, expressed 
some concern about the dwindling hotel occupancy rate 
and suggested that perhaps the city was expecting large 
events such as the Republican National Convention, 
baseball's All-Star Game, or another Super Bowl in the 
near future. Korch explained that events such as these 
generally attract a number of people to the area, creating a 
need for additional hotel and conference room space. 

Thecompletedprojectisalsoexpectedtocre<lteincreased 
amoWlts of traffic, according to La lolla Community 
Planner Brian Gater. 

"We're very concerned about [the possible traffic in-
crease],"Gatersaid. 'There's a traffic study going on right 
now, and we're in the process of updating our La Jolla 
Community Plan." 

A trJffic light, whicl. IS not yet in opet"Jri n. has been

The land, which include the Blackhorse townhouses 
IUldsome of the surrounding La JoUaFanns area inc1uding 
the chancellor's residence, was originally purchased by the 
UC Regents in 1967. ln 198 1, UCSO proposed the hotel 
ite and adjacent land and earned city approval after some 

revisions. The Blackhorse Farms development - which 
includes 121 units-wa~leasedbytheRagshipCompany 
in 1986, with construction finishing in 1988. Nearly all of 
the townhouses, which r.mge in price from $450,000 to 
$600,000 each, have been sold. 

DavidFremont,presidcntofUCSO'sGraduateStudem

negligence in leasing the 1.U\d toprivatecompanie . rJther

Conference Resort, on North Torrey Pines Rd. 

Campus Commllllity Planner Milton Phegley said that 
even though the Blackhorse townhouses are on university 
land, "very few people in connection with the university 
actually live there." 

Fremont said that the only way students could benefit 
from the building of a hoteVconference center on lllliver-
sity property is that the existing conference roorns in the 
University Center would become more readily available. 

The Ritz-Carlton's design will be similar in style to the 
existing Blackhorse townhouses, which were completed 
in 1988.1be hotel, whose principal architect is CYP of 
Irvine, will sport a "refined Mediterranean" style, which 
will not be like "the cheaper Mediterraneanstuff you might

hand-finished stucco buildings, wood-casement windows, 
and redÂ·tiled roofs in a small-scale setting. The design 
architect for .the project is Wimberly Allison Tong & Goo

No, they shouldn't be restricted

people should have a little bit of 
class and common decency 
when in the public eye.

NEA CENSORSHIP: PRO & CON

idea about censorship of the arts 
By Zachary B.erman 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

One of the main purposes of the Con-

Wlinen in their blood, not to mention the 
ConstilUtion. Unfonunately, there has al-
way been a problem with elected officials 
deciding how funds hould bespent ... offi-
cials are elected. A fine example of this is 
Jesse Helms. 

Let us assume for the moment that Pete 
Wilson, with all hi power on the Hill, was 
able to pass a law that forever guaranteed a 
woman the right to an abonion. 

Because California is such a pro-choice 
state, he would be a hero. Everyone would say 
what a good job he is doing repre enting the 
v iews of the state. No longer would he have to 
con tantly prove he is more pro-choice than 
Diane Fein tein. All he would have to do is

COMMENTARY 

2 Live Crew Bas 
â€¢ Case involving rappers 
could go all the way to the 

ng is Too Extreme 
Supreme Court 
By Phil Gruen 
Slaff Writer 

This is getting out of hand. 
Before I delve into a sea of attempted reasonings and 

explanations, I will state my stance outright: As Nasty as 
They Wanna Be, the controversial 1989 album from the 
rap group 2 Live Crew, should not be censored. 

Theongoingcontroversy surrounding this album could 
very well reach the Supreme Court in the near future, and 
when and ifitdoes, the Court would be wise to reverse the 
various censorship decisions that have been handed down 
since the album's release. 

Mel MIlrcelo/Guardian 

a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically de-
fined by the applicable state law. And finally, does the 
work, taken as a whole, lack any serious literary, anistic, 
political, or scientific value? 

In effect, the Miller case only served to establish that the 
Supreme Court could not come to any solid conclusions 
governing United States obscenity laws. 

lbis essentially set the proverbial table for stubborn, 
Bible-thumping Southern conservatives to throw their ~ 
flags and penalize the 2 Live Crew for creating an unpleas-
ant nuisance in their SO<alled pristine communities. Be-
cause of Miller, the 2 Live Crew may not have a whole lot 
of ground to stand on - and this is where the great tragedy 
lies. 

2 Live Crew will probably not be able to fight two of the 
parts of the majority 's decision in Miller - by Florida 
standards (andjust about any state's) the work does describe 
sexual conduct in a patently offensive manner and, in 
addition, judges will be hard-pressed to determine that the 
work, when taken as a whole, contains any serious literary, 
anistic, political, or scientific value. 

An upholding of its censorship would require the 
Court to establish an all-inclusive law banning nearly 
every questionable work (album, photograph, book, etc.) 
as obscene. If not all-inclusive, the Court will fmd itself 
with a mess of obscenity cases in the near future, and 
consistent anempts at writing and rewriting of the law. 

History tells us that vague guidelines of obscenity laws 
merely allow for possible offenders to find loopholes, in 
addition to plaguing courts with cases they can't really 

of 2 Live Crew's album to an undercover police officer. 
Was it a justified arrest? Perhaps - and it is this which is 
very unfortunate. 

Because the Supreme Court has left part of obscenity's 
definition up to "contemporary corrununity standards," the 
2 Live Crew is a dead crew, especially in the South. A solid 
definition of obscenity, therefore, doesn't really exist. 

determine. 
Considering the legality of pornography and the recent 

overturning of photographer Robert Mapplethorpe 's case, 
an all-inclusive Supreme Court decision is nOl a viable 
alternative. What must be made clear is this: all charges 
against the 2 Live Crew should be dropped, and the 
current obscenity laws should be made c1earer-perhaps 
dropping the "community standard" clause would be a 

TIle Supreme Court has seen scores of obscenity cases 
cross its desk in the past 25 years, but perhaps none with 
a decision as important - and currently relevant - as 
Miller V. California (1973). 

Without getting into details of the actual case, Miller 
determined that the laws defining obscenity were three-
fold. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Warren E. 
Burger explained, at the time, that in order for material to 
be considered obscene, "the average person, applying 
contemporary community standards," must first find that 
the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest 
(that interest which appeals to an "unwholesome" sexual 
drive). Second, whether the work depicts or describes, in 

In Miller, the Court's majority expanded upon its rea-
soning for allowing various communities to determine 
what is and what is not obscene by claiming that to 
.... . require a state to structure obscenity proceedings 
around evidence of aTUltioTUll' corrununity standard' would 
be an exe'rcise in futility." Fair enough. 

A "national community standard" would be ridiculous. 
But the mere existence of any community standard is also 
an exercise in futility, if not in severe inconsistency.

A couple of weeks ago, Pt Lauderdale record store 

owner Charles Freeman was arrested when he sold a copy 

PRO: NEA Funding is Not Vital 
For the Arts in America 
ContInued from page 4 
isconstandy in the spodight Ironically, 
the inverse of this situation exists with 
respect to the National Endowment for 
the Arts (NEA.) Jesse Helms is the hero 
to the South and villain to everyone else. 
In fact, as far as representing the wishes 
of his constituents, he is doing a great 
job. 

In the South the moral system is a 
little different than other parts of the 
United States. Religion is ingrained in 
their society. 

Along with this comes a lot of the 
traditional religious beliefs. Abortion, 
homosexuality, and pornography are 
evil. The last thing the:se people want to 
do is to see their hard-eamed tax dollars 
go towards the defacing of their God and 
the promotion of "evil." 

Keeping their point of view, as well 
as our electoral system of government in 
mind, I hope to show how keeping the 
NEA alive will remain a source of con-
troversy as well as unnecessary. A good 
place to begin would be some of the 
actual receivers of NEA grants. 

An interesting yet controversial re-
cipient of an NEA endowment is a work 
called "Piss Quist." 

In the work, a cross is submerged in 
a jar full of the artist's urine, all courtesy 
of the taxpayers' money. When looking 
at this, the first question that comes to 
mind is, why should the taxpayers give 
money toward submerging the crucifix 
in urine? 

Another culture-preserving and Fi.rst 
Amendment promoting grant from the 
NEA went to New Yode City's Kitchen 
Theater. They had an on-stage act by an 
aging porn star named Annie Sprinkle. 
In her show, she perfonned various 
sexual acts and fOl' those rich enough, 
five dollars bought a chance to explore 
one of her body cavities. 

Fortunately for those with the money 
but not the libido, audience members 

could get a photograpb of her breasts on 
top of their heads, instead of the fonner. 
Not being an ungracious perfonner, she 
took time out of her act to thank her 
sponsors. "Tonight my act is govenunent 
funded," thus giving credit where credit is 
due. 

The list does not stop here. Last year 
the NEA gave money to fund scenes of 
men performing oral and anal sex on each 
otheras well as on animals. In fact, the 
artist who received these grants stated in 
his exhibition that he wants to throw one of 
our Congressmen from California 
(Dannemyer) off the Empire State Build-
ing. 

Some people argue for the NEA based 
on the First Amendment. They feel that 
restricting the NEA is restricting their 
freedom of speech. 

Karen Finly, an artist who get a grant 
last year but not this one cries, "A year ago 
I was in the country of expression: now I 
am nol." 

Bullshit! Last year she was $5,000 into 
the taxpayers' pocket. She has just as 
much freedom of speech this year as last 
year. 

Perhaps to bring the situation more 
down to earth another example is appro-
priate. What if there was a radical skinhead 
artist who took pictures of Nelson Mandela 
or Manin Luther King and spray-painted 
"Nigger" all over them? 

What ifhe took pictures of Einstein and 
wrote "Dirty lew Bastard" on them? I 
believe once the people found out he was 
receiving NEA grants, the wisdom of the 
endowments would be questioned. 

I suppose the next question is how 
important is the NEA? 

The answer is minimal. Last year the 
Arts received $6.4 billion in private dona-
tions. Compare this to the $170 million it 
gets from the NEA and it makes you 
wonder, is it all worth it? 

The reason I used the various examples

lieve it is enough to get riled up about, but 
this is tiddlywinks if you think about how 
many of your tax DOLLARS are being 
used to fuel Helm's crusade for the past 16 
months. 

Opponents of the NEA claim they are 
notcondoningcensorship, they are merely 
removing the federal funding of art they 
deem questionable. However, by disal-
lowing funds for artists to produce their 
work:, their ideas are being kept from the 
American public. By not giving them a 
vehicle to express their ideas, opponents 
of the endowment are silencing them. 

Congress established the NEA 26 years 
ago 10 enhance the public 's awareness of 

~e arts. This means supporting the art 
community as a whole and not choosing 
particular favorites or dislikes. We are 
supporting freedom of expression for all. 

We cannot support one painting be-
cause we think it's beautiful, and not 
another because it disturbs us. We take the 
beautiful with the bold, all under the name 
of freedom. You cannot allocate your 
income taxes to social services, but not to 
the defense because you don't like what 
they are doing. You pay one swn to aU. 

Some believe that it is a no-win situa-
tion and thus itwould be best just to abolish 
the NEA completely. Art could subsist on 
private donations, couldn't it? 

What they fail to realize is that by 
removing the NEA, they would cease to 
recognize artists. 1be govenunent ac-
knowledges .. artist" as a legitimate pro-
fession. It is like any other job in that you 
do it because you want to, but also because 
you have to. ToeliminatetheNEA would 
be to remove the government "Stamp of 
Approval" of artists as a profession, and 
leave the nation with a large void. TIle 
government recognizcaU other profes-
ions, so why not the artists' . 

If the Senate decides to renew the 

NEA's contract, there is still an agenda of 
agreements that need to be made. 

One such would be the questionable 
selection procedure of grant recipients. As 
it is now, the panel is made up of a "peer 
review panel," which consists of artists, 
historians, museum curators, and profes-
sionals in the art community. 

A proposal would include non-artists 
on the panel. To give an example of this 
non-artist membership on the panel, lohn 
Frohnamayer, director of the NEA sug-
gests, "I'm going to get a truck driver who 
likes country music and put him on the 
folk-art panel." 

Art critics are skilled at understanding 
art, just as doctors are trained at giving 
medical diagnoses. It makes sense to have 
someone who knows what he is talking 
about make such decisions. If we put the 
art into the hands of the public it will 
quickly die of neglect. Look at all the 
public art out on the streets that people j ust 
sit on, piss on, or deface with graffiti. 

We need intelligent people with artistic 
insight to help shape what's available for 
the common good. New ideas are good 
and encourage people to re-think their 
values and beliefs. 

Censorship is bad, in any fonn or me-
dium. Helms is censorship. We cannot 
allow him or his kind push us around and 
threaten to change the course of history. 

Art is good. We need it. True art only 
comes in one fonn, res/rictionJess. Helms 
has managed to tum this nation upside 
down and backwards over 8 photographs 
(7 of Mappelthorpe's 175 and Joseph 
Serrano's O. Whatever the Senate's deci-
sion, this issue will never lie at resl. 

Thcrewill always be artists whose work 
offends people, and people who are of-
fended. We live in a free nation, where 
ideas can be voiced regardless of whether 
they are supported or not. We mustsupport 
the voice and its power to be heard.

COMMENTARY 

Casualties of Love ... 
â€¢ Solace can be the victor in the war of love 
By Jenny Ko, Guardian Reporter 

Susan was spending long days in bed, paralyzed, 
because of her hopeless love for Bob. And Shannon 
was shedding bucketfuls of tears over her never-
around, out~f-town mate. 

Though these soap-opera fantasies do not e)(llCtl y 
miIrorreal-life stories, I cenainly did not need a broken 
back or two puffy eyes to tell me to stay single forever. 

l' ve heardoftoomanYlrueaM terrifying talesof un-
requited love to enter into the blissful mystique of 
coupledom. I think I would rather suffer through 
endless Friday nights alone at home in front of the TV 
with my Ben and Jeny' s (the icecream of course), than 
traverse through the battlefields of love. 

To my fortune, I discovered and joined a newly 
fonned club on campus called SAD.(Singles Against 
Dating). The name explains it all As the self-appointed 
recruiter for the club, I chose it as my duty to seek and 
help out the wounded soldiers of the War of Love. 

Heather Taylor, ajuniorat Muir college. related to 
me a sorrowful experience. 'lt was a three-year anni-
versary with a cheap S.O.B. He called me up and said, 
'Pick any place you want to go.' J decided on theOlart 
House , a nice restaurant 

'1 got all dressed upand he showed up in tom shorts, 
termis shoes without socks, and a really wrinkled tank 
top." In the restaurant after a nice meal, the boyfriend 
chimed in, "Honey, I forgot my wallet," and left poor 
Heather stuck with the bill. 

She broke up with him at dinner and took a cab 
home. As Heatherdescribedit, "I got over him between 
my salad and my steak." That must be nue, since she 
hooked up with her cunent boyfriend the very next 
morning. . 

It was obvious, then that Heather was one girl who 
knew how to take care of herself aM did not need any 
of my help. 

[ met another potential recruit into SAD. in my 
biology class. Kristen Reza, a freshman at Muir, told 
me about her ups-and-<lowns in a cwrent relationship. 
"We were going out for two months when he went 
away for two weeks on a business trip. He didn't leave 
a phone number or a hotel room number. But he came 
back with an engagement ring." But two weeks later, 

when herex-boyfriend showed up foraswprise visit while 
her fiance was there, "He took the ring back," Kristen 
explained 

It was unbelievable to me- the atrocities of the War 
of Love. However, Kristen proudly and happily reported 
that the ring is being sized again. 

Shauna Walker, a Muir college junior,likewise spoke 
ofabrokenengagement ''I was engaged to a guy fora year. 
We were to be manied in fourmonths, and then I broke up 
with him. I realized he was really possessive. He made me 
feel guilty about watching TV with my mom and wanted 
me to quit school" 

As it turns out, Shauna was another unacceptable 
member because she has found ''magic'' in her current 
relationship. 

Love does not only tug 00 thehe<utstrings, but also the 
pursestrings as junior Diane Mislead of Warren college 
has discovered. Diane was prepared to go on a big date 
duringChristrnas. '1 spent over $ I 00 on a dress and three 
hours getting ready." 

But he never showed up,leaving Diane all dressed up 
with nowhere to go. He apparently didn' t even call to 
cancel. A month or so later, Diane heard the explanation. 
"I just didn't want 10 go." 

I had only heard fnxn one side of the casualty list, so 
I searched for male recruits for my club. What Michael 
Albano, a Revellecollegejunior, hadtosaywaspelhaps 
the most heartbreaking stol)' of them all. 

"I was with my first girlfriend for a year. She left me 
foranotherguy. I was withmy second girlfriend fora year.

â€¢ Men and women have 
different ways of 
expessing their attraction 
Story by Gavin Christy, Staff Writer 

There exislS among all the wonders ofUCSD an indomitable force 
that fills people with a sense of wonder and excitement. Lurl<.ing 
behind evel)' comer, this force we call attraction keeps different kinds 
of people asking themseJves just what it is they find so alluring about 
each other. 

Attractionhasbeenthecatalysttheseinitialweeksofclassformany 
people who wish to acquire a friendship, a contact, a phone nwnber, 
or a dale. But what is atttaction? Some assen that attraction occurs 
between opposites. Are certain people truly opposite, or do they both 
want the same things and just pursue them differently? 

A Guardian questionnaire, sampling a small, rdndom population 
ofUCSD students who wish to remain anonymous, has anempted to 
answer this and other questions about the elusive idea of attraction. 

Commenting on the difference of genders, one female respondent 
said, "Menare taughtto be ' strong' but sometimes if they act too strOng 
or macho, it may seem like they are unemotional," obsetved one 
femaiestudent about males. And one male student said, "Women are 
a lot more gentle and loving - but they are awfully moo:Iy." 

Dr. Richard Whit.ehill, directorofPsychologicaJ and Counseling 
Services, exlained, ''Men and women express their needs differently 
because of their physiololgy and socialization." 

"Men don't [seem to) get bogged down by emotions," said one 
woman when complimenting men on their good qualities. 

Once it is obvious that they are attracted to one another, people 
have different ways of reacting, according to the questionnaire. Most 
female respondents replied that they would wait for the men to make 
the move. 

As one respondent put it, "I'm a little shy. [I'd) probably just wait 
until he asks meoutormak:es effon to taJJc to me." Other.; c \aimed they 
would use subtle tactics like paying a lot of anention to a guy, smiling 
and laughing a lot, and acting demure and shy to win a guy over. 

While men snuggle through initiation by way of prepared intro-
ductions or "lines," women keep a conversation going by the subtle 
art of tliIting, according to most respondents. 

"I think women can be more subtle flirts, and guys come up with 
more original pick-up Jines," one female obsetved. "If it's not overly 
suave and overly rehearsed sounding, it can be flattering, and some-
times vel)' humorous. Some shyness is kind of cute." 

Most men said that they think of flirting as too anlbiguous and 
don 't know how to approach it 'They reveaJ that since women areable

Film Club Makes 'Hard Core' Movies I LOVE: Men Aren't Too 
thaJ" ~!:~~~ger than any of its Subtle in Their Approach By John Steckert Guardian Reporter CLUB SCENE 

' 'There' nothinge\se-justus-
the cameras - and those wonderful 
people out there in the darlc" 

These words spoken by Gloria 
Swanson in the final scene of Billy 
Wilder' "Sunset Boulevaro" perhaps 
best exempli fy theessenceofHardcore 
Productions, UCSO's resident film-
making organization. 

In Winter Quaner of 1989, gradu-
ate student Rico Martinez along with 
undergraduates Milton ReICher and 
Michael AlbertS, creared this film pro-
duction facility. Adopting the name 
Hardcore for its connotation of work-
ing long, sleepless hours, what was 
once a concept t<XJI.. onaconcretefoml. 

"When this club was fonned, there 
were two goals in mind," said Peter 
Rollins, director of Harocore's current 
project "One was to make films and 
the other was to teach people the pro-
cess by which to do so." 

To accentuate these goals, an ex-
ecutive council, comprised of elected 
club officers, was created to work in 
conjW1Ction with the producer and di-
rector of each film. Additionally, a 
series of workshops was developed to 
promote the instruction of film-mak-
ing and gi ve members practical hands-
on experience. 

"l!gaven1Ctheopponunitytoleam 
thing earlier than in the visual an 
classes without the pressure of grades," 
said Michelle Kasik, Hardcore's cur-
rent president. "And you don't have to 
worry about taking care of evetything 
yourse\fbecause you are working with 
a large group. It's just like a movie 
studio." 

OnJanuary 12,1990,justoneyear 

A look at student organizations 
after the club began, all oP-Iardcore' s 
work came to fruition: its first movie, 
a 16mm black-and-white film about 
the evolvement of primitive man en-
titlcd"BugsInOurHair,"premiered at 
the Price Center. 

This movie was followed by the 
release of the club's second film on 
June8th,asurferthrillercalled"Nuclear 
Wasted.'Â· 

Based on a sto1)' by T.e. Boyle, 
"Bloodfall" is Hardcore's third film. 
but the first to be shot entirely in color. 
it is tentati vel scheduled for release 
during the third week of March. 

"Forthe first two years we have had 
to concentrate on getting thing going 
and proving that we can make films," 
Rollins said "We have done that and 
are now hoping to expand the scope of 
what we do while still maintaining our 
focus on making films." 

The script chosen for Hardcore's 
fourth production, "Sara," is an ex-
ample of Hardcore's expansion. Ac-
cording to "B100dfall 's" post produc-
tion producer Dave Blaettler, the film, 
"represents a departure from past m0-
tifs." 

"All of Hardcore's previous films 
have featured predominantly young, 
white males," Rollins said "I thought 
that it was time for something differ-
ent.." 

Written by Josefina Lopez, "Sara" 
portrays an El Salvadorian refugee who 
comes to work as a live-in maid for an

BEYOND HOLLYWOOD 
â€¢ French film 'Monsieur Hire' proves there is more to 
the art of filmmaking than sex and violence 
By Caitlin Woodthorpe and Simon Hobbs, Staff Writers 

"Monsieur Hire" has won huge international acclaim on 
the movie circuit and was a massive hit at the 1989 Cannes, 
Toronto, and New York Film Festivals. It's a prime example of 
the very best of French filmmaking, a timely reminder that 
there's far more to the movies than just the "sex and violence" 
epics that Hollywood has .been churning out recently. 

The basic plot is fairly straightforward. A girl has been 
murdered and the chief suspect is Monsieur Hire, a rather 
strange recluse who is disliked by all those around him. His 
only pleasure is to spy on the beautiful young woman, Alice, 
who lives in the opposite apartment - particularly when she 
and her boyfriend are Page H 4

Native Nakai 
â€¢ Flutist to play at 
Mandeville tonight 
By Michael Schwartz 
Senior Staff Writer 

New age music is growing in popular-
ity as more and more artists manipulate 
sounds and music with synthesizers. 
Ironically, in the front lines ofthis revo-
lution is a Native American flutist , R. 
Carlo Nakai, who blends ynthesizers 
and modem capabilities with ancient and 
traditional melodies of the continent. 

A member of the Navajo-Ute tribe 
and the son of a former Navajo tribal 
chairman, akai has lived and studied 
with many North American tribes. Fol-
lowing ervice in the U.S. Navy, Nakai 
earned a degree in education from North-
ern Arizona University. 

With a background on the classical 
trumpet, Nakai switched to the Native 
American flute in 1973. After leaming 
the traditional flute melodies of the Plains 
and Woodlands tribes , he began composing and 
creating a style of his own using both the bone and 
wood flute. 

The flute is an instrument of the Plains people 
and Woodlands Indian around the Great Lakes. 
Nakai conducted extensive research into the tra-
dition of these tribes as the flute is not used in 
Navajo music today. The tradition of the flute 
was most likely lost intheNavajo migration i'rom 
Canada. 

"I draw from my experience here in the world 
right now," Nakai saidÂ· in an interview by phone 
from his current home in Tucson, Arizona. "It 's 
contemporary, original music. It's demonstrative 
of an ongoing world view andphilosophy." Asked 
to expand on this van tage point, his response was 
simply, "We're here now." 

Hailed as the premiere Native American flu t-
ist, Nakai deplores the tenn "Native American." 
"We are not a part of the melting pot theory. We 
are definitely not Native Americans. We were 
here, the people I belong to, and aU other native 
peoples, before America was invented in 1783. I 
find the name patronizing," said Nakai. 

Having recorded five solo albums, Nakai is 
gaining popularity as a recording artist. Although 
he has been working for the past year on an 
Original dance score for a dance company in 
Tucson that will open this month, Nakai has a 
new album, Winter Dreams, that comes out this 
month. 

Friday, October 19, 1990 

"It 's a collection of traditional winter solstice 
music from many traditions in Europe. It 's com-
monly referred to in this country as Christmas 
music. There is no common understanding of 
Christmas in Europe," Nakai said. 

Plagued by misunderstandings and stereotype 
as a self-proclaimed "cultural educator," Nakai has 
been able to find peace with being part of the Native 
culture. "It's a matterof perspectives," Nakai stated. 
"When you're looking from outside the culture and 
outside the tradi tional philosophy, you're looking 
in a manner that places categories and priorities on 
certain rules. When you're looking from the inside 
out, everything that you are , everything you intend 
to be, everything that you need for your survival is 
here already." 

Nakai asserts in his personal goals that he will 
"compose, arrange, and perform new music for the 
Native American flute by utilizing western method-
ology and performance techniques to integrate the 
flute into contemporary music." 

Nakai will be performing original compositions 
as well as arrangements of traditional melodies 
tonight at the Mandeville Auaitorium.

Brazilian Traditions 
Brought to the Stage 
By Paula Correa 
Staff Writer 

In the 1500s, thousand of Af-
ricans were brought to the shore 
of Bahia, Brazil , as slaves. Forced 
to work long days on the planta-
tions under the watchful eyes of 
their masters , they managed to 
secretly practice and pa s on their 
ancestors' traditions- through 
dance. 

This art of storytelling - de-
picting ceremonies, battles, ritu-
als, and seductions - was per-
formed last Sunday at Mandeville 
Auditorium by the New York-
based company Dance Brazil. 

The performance featured a 
variety of Afro-Brazilian dances 
such as Maculele, Samba, and 
Capoeira (a martial arts dance). 
These were complemented with 
beating drums, chimes, chanting, 
and vivid costumes. 

Though Dance Brazil was de-
picted as an Afro-Brazilian folk 
dance show, the perfonnances 
themselves proved to be greatly 
influenced by European styles of 
dance such as ballet, jazz, and 
modem dance. 

Such a combination of dance 
styles gave the production a broad 
feel, and incorporated its diversity 
with fluidity and grace. 

Unfortunately, Dance Brazil 
came short of tru ly being a "folk" 
dance show. Accordi ng to Dennis 
Newsome, a San Diego African 
martial arts dance perfonner and 

teacher, the cultural fibers oftradi-
tional African-influenced dance 
were not c lea rl y depicted in 
Sunday's performance. 

He believes that to call it a folk 
c:mcc "you have to present a folk 
dance," that is, "taking it like it is 
naturally [in its natural context) 
and re-creating it on the stage ... 
that is African theatre." 

Newsome called it a watered-
down version that was more con-
cerned with symmetry than spon-
taneity . 

The mood was set by the beat-
ing of the drums which was the 
integral part of the performance, 
and even though Dance Brazil did 
not do justice to its African roots in 
its eclectic combination of dance 
styles, it did in its closing number 
"Capoeira." 

This fast, graceful, and acro-
batic martial arts dance created by 
African slaves brought to Brazil 
from Angola as a means of self-
protection and as a way to fight for 
their freedom was "great" accord-
ing to Newsome, and "true to its 
roots." 

Even though Dance Brazil was 
not a true Afro-Brazi lian folk dance 
performance, the quality of its Af-
rican influences were evident. 

The combination of different 
styles along with live drums and 
other unique elements such as 
chanting and costumes make it an 
impressive and enchanting pro-
duction.

INXS has found a "sound" that

Combine both redundant lyrics,

X. It seems that by now, the band 
would want to experiment with 
their music and display the range 
of their capabilities; yet, with thi 
album, the only thing they show is 
their desire to maintain commer-

The only two decent songs on 
this album are ''The Stairs," a rock 
anthem that pleads for ocial coop-

However, judging from INXS 's

Leconte ' s film is apparently a 
murder-mystery, but this soon be-
comes a subplot to the complex 
relation hip developing between 
Hire and Alice. 

Possibly the bigge t distinction 
between French and mainstream 
American films is that the former 
are usual1y far more int imate, a 
style of filmmaking easily forgot-

Hollywood films which empha ize 
"large- cale" in everything. 

The action of "Monsieur Hire"

away from your face rather than on 
a screen somewhere in the di rance. 
The overall effect is therefore de-
lightfully claustrophobic. as the 
camera trail the actors in ex-
tremely close proximity. This is a 
movie with only four character in 
it, and twO of those are confined to 
the periphery . Hire himself, there-
fore. becomes the total focus of 
audience attention in a way far 
more involved than is u~ual for 
recent films. 

Undoubtedly. the cinematogra-
phy IS the prime vehicle for con-
veying this sense of intimacy. 
Clllematographer Denis Lenoir's 
images pay close allention to the 
smallest but the mo t ymboJic 
detail of Hire's life. He perfectly 
convey the truly French atmo-
phere and manages to give it a 

timeles quality. 
The film is quinte sential1y 

French. but n 's not rooted in the

can take on the greatest signifi-
cance. The most mundane acts can 
take on a whole new meaning in 
this sexually charged atmo phere.

"Monsieur Hire" is adapted

+North Coast Repertory Theater Production fails to impress a San Diego audience 

It 's hard to tell at times when 
one track ends and another sta rts. 
To be honest, th is is wallpaper 
music, the stu ff which arouses no 
real emotion except nausea. It j ust 
makes you wonder how the music 
indu try coped before drum ma-
chines were invented. Not only do 
the Osmo nd Boys succeed in 
massacring their own songs, they 
also assassinate the Four Tops' 
song "Can ' t Help Myself' and 
Carole King's "Hey Girl." 

1n all faimes .the production is 
technically very good and there 
are a couple of superb guitar and 
axophone solos. But , let's face it , 

thank to good producers and ses-
sion mu icians, all it takes to get 
this kind of sound is money, not 
any level of personal anistic abil-
ity. The Osmonds were a part of 
the I 970s, but someone should tell 
them that that 's where they ought 
to be content to stay. 

- Caitlin Woodthorpe 

By Michael Schwartz 
Senior Staff Writer 

The distance between San Di-
ego and New York can be mea-
sured not only in mi les, but in 
cultural differences. This is evi-
dent in the current production of 
"Eastern Standard, " the Broadway 
show of last year that is making its 
San Diego debut at the North 
County Repertory Theatre. 

Jokes about taxi cabs 3nd city 
architecture wentoverthe heads of 
the vast majority of the audience. 
Much of the humor of the play, 
written for the " thirtysomething" 
yuppies lost in the chaos of a me-
tropolis, was lost on the group of 
senior-ci tizens watching in San 
Diego. Billed as "a screwball com-
edy abut happiness and heart-
break," it seems the director might 
also have missed a great deal. 

Like Nei l Simon, playwright 
Richard Greenberg has mastered 
the crafts of writing wi ttydia!ogue, 

mixing liberal humor with deep 
traumas, and creating plays that 
put problems into pro per perspec-
tive in two and a half hours. 

The play' fi rst act puts us in a 
restaurant in midtown Manhattan, 
where a montage of table conver-
sation introduces us to the gang. 
Stephen is a self-proclaimed ar-
chetype of urban blight, a man in 
his thirties de tined to die wi thout 
following through on anything. 
He's been eyeing the woman illing 
at the next table, as he has for 
weeks. Then the re is Drew, 
Stephen's friend who belts out, 
"Oh , actress!" at the passing 
waitress. He's eyeing the man at 
the next lable with the woman. 

In a lucky twist of fate, Phoebe, 
the woman at the next table, has 
been watching Stephen and is in-
terested in him. Her brother, Peter, 
is gay and has been watching Drew. 
However, he's not going to make a 
move as he is silently suffering

from AIDS. 
May, an obscene and verbose 

bag lady, throws a bollleof Perrier 
across the restaurant and the ex-
cuse for everyone to meet is cast. 

The 45-minute firs t act set the 
stage for the lengthy and tiresome 
second act, where everyone is 
brought together at Stephen's 
beach house for the summer. Based 
on confrontation and re olution, 
the action teeters on the trite and 
predictable, but Greenberg always 
manages to keep an edge and makes 
us care about these people. 

The actors are all capable of 
carrying their respective roles. The 
weakne s is in the casting of two 
US International University e-
niors in the roles of Stephen and 
Drew. They appear so much 
younger than theirconstantly stated 
thirty years that the audience be-
comes very conscious of actors on 
a ~ tage, and not real people. The 
technical aspects of the show are 

also fine, keeping the focus al-
ways on the actors and not the 
design. An exception to th is is the 
occas ionall y obtru sive wave 
crashing in during the second act. 

While the production i not 
stellar, the quality of material 
merits a tri p to the NCRT to see 
this production. 

This i not a play that ~as a 
great statement to make. It advo-
cates no positions on relationships, 
homosexuality, or anything else. 
At times sad and dis turbing, oth-
ers uplifting and touching, it is 
simplyasliceoflifethat how the 
audience how all problems can be 
overcome.

â€¢ Armstrong Says Alberts 
To Miss Rest of Regular 
Season with Head Injury 

Junior forward Mike Al berts will more 
than likely beout forthe remainderofthe 
UCSO men'~ occer team's regular 
season, according to Triton Head Coach 
Derek Armstrong. 

Alberts was originally injured on Oct. 
7 at CSU San Bernardino, when he col-
lided in mid-air with the Coyotes' center 
fullback. 

Initial reports said that Alberts suf-
fered a concussion, and would be hos-
pitalized overnight for observation. 

But, ources said, irregularities were 
discovered in his x-ray, and doctors, 
unsure of whether the injury is from a 
previou injury, have recommended that 
he be kept out of action for 4-6 weeks. 

Alberts has since been scheduled for 
a reexamination by a neurosurgeon, ac-
cording to Armsrrong. 

Armstrong added that it is conceiv-
able that AlbertS could return to action 
by the playoffs.

I Extra Effort in Extra Period 
â€¢ Women's soccer goes to overtime to 
get its 10th shutout of the season, a 1-0 
decision over UC Irvine Wednesday ; 
Cheryl Parker scores the winning goal 
By Robb Earnest 
Staff Writer 

At halftime of Wednesday ' women's soccer game between 
UCSD and UC Irvine, it appeared that the Tritons had everything 
under control. 

The score after 45 minutes of play was 0-0, but the Tritons didn't 
eem to be overly concerned. 

TIley were smiling and talkative, as though they had something 
up their sleeves. Like they new that they would core the winning 
goal eventually. Even if it took an extra period . 

Although the Tritons dominated most of the game, neither team 
had many scoring opponunitie in regulation play. 

Going into ovenime, the Tritons looked fresher and stronger than 
the Antealers. A minu te and 15 econds into the extra period, fresh 
and trong took over. 

Karin Lindsay nailed a cro s that wa vo lleyed in by Cheryl 
Parker past the diving Anteater goalkeeper. 

The assist will have to do for Lindsay. who failed to record a goal 
for the firs t time in seven games. 

"We created more chances than they did. We outplayed them at 
least 70 percent of the game," Head Coach Brian McManus said. 

One of the major reasons the Tritons outplayed Irvine could be 
found in the defense. Make that four reasons. 

Defenders Danielle Placek, Jaymie Bradford, Jennifer Kingsbury, 
and goalie Karin Carper enjoyed solid games. Carper recorded her 
ten th shutout of the season. 

According to McManus, the win -the Tritons' second overthe 
Division [ Anteaters this year - was a big one for UCSD. 

"This was as well as we've played all year," he said. 
" We're still a young team , and we are trying to find that right 

blend. We' re getting close. 

Greg Benes/Guardian 
Jennifer Kingsbury has been part of 10 shutouts this season. 

"One thing that we have to work on is trying not to panic. Even 
if you dominate 90 percent of the game, you have to leam to deal 
with that other 10 percent when your opponent puts the pressure on." 

Volleyball Avoids Big Upset 
By Andrew Gayton 
Guardian Reporter 

The UCSO women's volleyball team 
learned a les~on in humility Wednesday 
night from The Master' s College, 

The Master's came into the game rela-
tively unknown to UCSD. Although the 
Tritons' record is 2-0 against the Mustangs, 
UCSD Head Coach Doug Dannevik said 
beforeha.nrl that he didn't know what to 
expect. And he nearly paid for it. 

But, after two hours of a grueling volley-
ball tug-o-war, the Tritons (24-6) squeaked 
by the Mustangs in five games, 15-8, 15-9, 
14-16,2-15,15-7. 

The victory boosted UCSO's record to 
24-6, but really had no bearing on its number 
two NCAA Division ill ranking. 

For the first two games, at least, the 
Tritons held to form, holding the Mustangs 
to single digits. Like a well-oiled machine, 
UCSD used all its parts efficiently. 

Middle blocker Elizabeth Tan had the 
ball nearly dancing on the net, with several 
dips and fakes. Tan also showed some power 
by pounding 11 kills. 

Outside hitter Dana Simone kept the 
Mustang defense busy diving to dig up her 
powerful kills, What The Master's managed 
to return left its hands numb from the impact. 

Freshman setter Julie Fabian showed her 
patented consistency with 4 1 assists in four 
games. 

Amy Banachowski, st ill recovering from 
a sprained ankle, came through with 13 
assi t in game three. 

" We're tryi ng to slowly get Amy back in 
the game," Dannevik said. "She will play in 
the upcoming tournament, but probably not 
stan. " 

After winning the first two games hand-

Julie Fabian (I) is currently starting; Jennifer Cross (r) has yielded her starting job. 
ily, the Tritons stumbled in games three and 
fo ur, nearly burying themselves under six 
feet of vo lleyballs and bunhuggers in the 
proverbial hole. 

Dannevik rleared the bench for game 
three , and the Tri tons promptly fell behind 
7-2. They fought a grueling game in falling 
14- 16, but the in itial deficit was just too big. 

' 'The was the firstli me [the second string) 
played on the ir own." Dannevik said. "They 
didn ' t play with spi rit. It was j ust an ugly 
match." 

The Triton~ ~witched gears for game 
four, sli pping in the staners from games one 
and two. This proved their undoing, as the 

Mustangs took a quick 7-0 lead. 
You could have safely taken a restroom 

trip at that point, and saved yourse lf the 
pain. 

"Tht starters were cold from the one 
game lag," Dannevik aid, "They were out 
of rhythm, and frustrated from the previous 
game [loss)." 

Warming to their task, Ihe staners came 
out for game five and dominated the Mus-
tangs, with thehelpoftwoaces from Simone 
and outside hitter Liz Vesanovic. 

Aside from a yellow card on Dannev ik , 
the Tritons dispatched the Mustang wi th-
out any hint of their earlier tumble .

UCSD NOTEBOOK 

A preview of this weekend's UCSD sporting events: 
â€¢ WOMEN'S SOCCER: 
Occidental at UCSD, Saturday, 3 p .m. 

Pomona-Pitzer, where are you? The Tritons' on-again, off-
again schedule lakes another swerve into the world of the off-
again, as UCSD will face off against Occidental Saturday. 

After trouncing Pomona-Pitzer 6-0 last Monday, the Tritons 
went into overtime Wednesday, squeaking by UC Irvine 1-0 . 
Now, here come the Occidental Tigers. 

Our crack research staff thought it couldn ' t get much worse 
than Pomona-Pitzer, which the Tritons had outscored 23-0 before 
the most recent slaughter-fest. 

But, wouldn't you know it , here comes a team agai nst which the 
Tritons have recorded back-to-back 7-0 victories. The numbers, 
however, are misleading. 

In fact, Occidental should provide significantly more compe-
tition than the Sagehens, as it has only been outscored 17-0 in its 
last three games. 

If the Pomona-Pitzer game is any indication, the Occidental 
contest will more than likely be hotly contested- when UCSD 
Head Coach Brian McManus puts in the second string. 

â€¢ WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL: 
U~SD at Washington University (MO) National Invitation, 
Fnday-SaturdIlY, all day 

Mr. Dannevik goes to Washington ... University in St. Louis, 
that is. 

The nationally second-ranked Tritons head to the great Mid-
west this weekend for some major-league volleyball action. 

The winnerofthe invitational will more than likely be favored 
at the national championship tournament in mid-November. 

The top-notch competition will include the number one team in 
the nation, defending champion Washington University, the fourth-
ranked team in the nation College of St. Benedict, and theeleventh 
and twelfth-ranked teams, La Verne and Illinois-Benedictine. 

The Tritons are heading to Missouri at nearly full strength. 
Setter Amy Banachowski has almost fully recovered from a 
sprained ankle and will see playing time, but Julie Fabian will s till 
start in her place, according to Head Coach Doug Dannevik.

Amy's ALL-WET Tube-Polo Update 
AA: With two weeks of the season down the drain the 
cream is rising to the top of the Natatorium. Fortu-
nately, the sophisticated filtration system at the 
'nat' can handle the residue better than the Budman '5 
XR-4000 Supercomputer. 

Goals are being tallied at a record pace and it Is 
difficult to tell just how legit some of the final scores 
are. The highest scoring team, KOKOPEW, is 
averaging 25 goals per game. But, then they have 
been playing against stiffs who make lifeguards very 
nervous. The story in AA is most likely the same as 
it has been for years. 

The SWIM FAGS are playing with a renewed arro-
gance. Captain Rich DanielS claims, "We are not 
only the most talented team, but also the best 
looking. We look to good to lose. I've seen all the 
other teams, and there just isn't anyone that can 
touch us - though I wish someone WOUld." Several 
other squads may respond to the SWIM FAGS self 
proclaimed supremacy. 

Arst on the agenda is DEJA VU. On Monday night 
they will clash with the 'FAGS' in a rematch of last 
years championship game_ Paul Castle berg's DEJA 
VU squad Is led in scoring by Kiwi Reinhart, but 
Daniels will counter on defense with Randy Franke 
who Is still on parole for what he did to a poor gal in 
a game last spring (she is recovering quite well) _ 
Castleberg Is hoping that all the attention on Reinhart 
will let Matt Corey and Tracy Kehr get open and take 
advantage of the weak goalies that guard the SWIM 
FAGS net_ 

The other squads that have shown the most spark 
so far are GETTING TUBED, POKING EUPHORIA and 

the veteran squad of Don TUBE STEAK. 
EUPHORIA will be tested on Sunday nl .... t by RUB-
BERS FOR EVERYONE. Both teams are undefeated 
thus far. TUBE STEAK may be the best of this bunch, 
but will have to waft for the playoffs to see the top 
two squads of Monday night's 'Little Fat Kid' league. 
A: This is traditionally a sand bag deluxe division and 
it Is comforting to know that this season Is no 
exception. Fortunately, the 1M Dept.'s XR-4000 will 
be able to tell who really belongs, and who should get 
bumped up Into the AA division come playoff time. 

ATLANTIS and the ARRGONAUTS are ripping up 
the 'Franchize' league. They will meetin whatahould 
be a battle for the title of King of all Revelle, on 
Tuesday Oct. 30. Two undefeated teams from the 
'Skluto' league, BUGS ON DRUGS and KOOKS ON 
PARADE should provide the Psychology Department 
years of interesting data when they hook up on 
Monday night. Another league championship will be 
on the line Oct. 24, when GUNS AND HOSES square 
off with SIDNEY'S ALBACORE. 

If any oftllese teams falter, 1001< for DON'T BREAK 
OUT RUBBER, WE GOT JACKED, IT'S LUKES FAULT, 
CEO'S FOR HIRE or BOGGY CORNFlAKES to be there 
on Championship Thursday. Not only Is this division 
famous for sand bagging, but also for upsets. In 
(ither wordS, anyone could get hot at the end of the 
season and grab the title. But there is one thing that 
you can always count on, great action. So, If you are 
looking for a study break some night get down to the 
Natatorium_

UCSD AlioCampus 
Tennis Singles Champlonshl 
SaturdayÂ·Sunday/October 27-28/Muir Courts 

Here we go againl It's Wimbledon West in late October for the 15th corlse(;U1III1'U 
year. And there's no strawberries and cream for sale at this tennis 
Maybe a pumpkin pie or two, but no red-eyes 
at this baby! No sireel This is a REAL tennis toumament. Not the foofy affair 
we see in London every summer. 

This baby that were talking about is the UCSD All-Campus Tennis Singles 
Championships that will be making its annual run on Salurday-Sunday, October 27-
28. 

AII-campus tennis players are inVited. The divisions are four-fold: Men's Open, 
Men's Intermediate, Women's Open, Women's Intermediate. The format is simple. 
It's a double-participation tournament that guarantees all players a minimum of two 
matches. Obviously, the more you win, the more you get to play, the more you begin 
to look like Stefan Edberg or Michael Chang or Pete Sampras or Steffi or Gaby or 
Monica. Its that Simple. 

Even the entry fee is a no-brainer. Bring one can of new tennis balls to the 
tournament site (the Muir Courts) and you are in. 

But there is one tricky step. You have to sign-up way down at the Canyonview 
Recreation Office in order to play. No big deal, just take the Shuttle. It goes right by 
Canyonview. Entry deadline is Thursday, Oct 25 al Spm. 

When you sign, indicate a morning or allernoon start time preference on Saturday 
and we'll do our best to make it happen.
