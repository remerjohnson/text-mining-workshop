Fraternity Banned 
For Three Yea,. 
RIVERSIDE - The UC 
Riverside administration has 
suspended Phi Kappa Sigma 
for three years, revoking its 
status as a student organiza-
tion. The suspension was a 
result of the fraternity'S rush 
t-shirt, which Chicano and 
Latino groups found offen-
sive. The decision, which was 
also prompted by other 
violations of the Student 
Conduct Code, overrode 
penalties imposed by UCR's 
Inter-Fraternity Council 
earlier this month.

DA VIS - Computer crashers 
and contradictory information

students and faculty at UC 
Davis wondering whether the 
new system is an improve-

Although over 21,000 
students have successfully 
registered using the new 
phone system, glitches and 
overloads have caused the 
computer to crash at crucial 
moments, threatening student 
access to the RSVP system. 
"Overall, we did pretty well," 
said Registrar Evelyn Babey.

Atkinson Threatens to Resign 
SPEECH: Chancellor 
criticizes reimbursement 
policy for research costs 
By Elaine Camuso 
Associate News Editor 

In an address before the Aca-
demic Senate on Tuesday, Chan-
cellor Richard Atkinson said he 
will resign if UCSD does not start 
receiving its fair share of reim-
bursements for research overhead 
costs from the University of Cali-
fornia. 

"I will not be chancellor after 
July I if we are not given equitable 
distribution," he said. 

The issue of indirect costs was 
a key part of Atkinson's speech, 
which also concerned enrollment, 
faculty and staff retirement and 
his view of the recent budget cri-
sis. 

Overhead costs, otherwise 
known as indirect costs, are in-
cluded in federal research grants 
to cover excess costs, such as re-
search employees who are not on 
the UC payroll. According 10 
Atkinson, half of this money goes 
to the state and the remaining half 
is distributed among the UC cam-
puses by the Office of the Presi-
dent. 

This year, UCSD was refunded 
78 percent of its overhead, the 
second-lowest percentage next to 
UC San Francisco's 74 percent. 
Other UC campuses such as Santa 
Cruz an'd Riverside received well 
over 100 percent of their indirect 
costs. 

" In my judgment, there is abso-
lutely no rationale that this money 
should not be returned," Atkinson 
said. "If this is to continue, this 
campu is really being done an 

Now You SEE IT ... 

injustice," he added, urging the 
senate to clarify this issue wi th the 
Office of the Pres ident. 

Atkinson expressed concern 
that news of UC budgetary prob-
lems will spread across the coun-
try and cause other univer ities 10 
look to UC chool a sites for 
recruitment, leading to a loss of 
faculty. 

This year, UCSD will 10 e a 
significant number of faculty and 
staff to VERIP Ill, an early retire-
ment plan which will go into ef-
fect on Monday. Forty-one per-
cent of the 1,324 eligible faculty 
and staff members at UCSD have 
elected to take early retirement, 
the highest rate of all UC school . 
Atkinson noted that VERIP III wi II 
have a profound effect on this cam-
pus. "There are key people 
throughoutthis institution who will 
not be here next Monday."

Isla Vista Halloween Party Could Come Crashing Down 
UCSI: UC students 
advised to avoid annual 
holiday festivities 
By Jonne '''mer 
Associate News Editor 

UCSD students who plan to 
attend the popular Halloween fes-
tival in Isla Vista near the UC 
Santa Barbara campus could be in 
for a rude awakening as a result of 
new ordinances passed by the 
Santa Barbara Board of Supervi-
sors. 

An Oct. 19 letter by UCSB 
Vice Chancellor of Student Af-

fairs Michael Dennis Young out-
lines the consequences for break-
ing the new ordinances. Accord-
ing to Young, "fines for alcohol-
related offenses have been sub-
stantially increased." 

First offenses will result in 
fines of $100; however, the re-
quired court fee will raise the to-
tal cost to an offender to $270 for 
an act such as drinking in public 
or carrying an open bottle of beer. 
Misdemeanors. such as public 
drunkeness, could mean spend-
ing a night in the county jail. 

"This year, more than ever be-
fore,law enforcement officers will 

be-cracking down on lawbreakers. 
The Santa Barbara County Sheriff 
has announced his department's 
intention to show no tolerance for 
illegal behavior," Young said. 

The Santa Barbara Board of 
Supervisors also recently passed a 
third ordinance, outlawing live 
bands in Isla Vista, that will start 
today and remain in effect through 
Sunday evening. Bands and loud 
recorded music will be not be al-
lowed between 6 p.m. and 7 a.m. 
during all four days of the Hallow-
een weekend. 

The ban on live bands has at-
tracted more criticism than the 

other laws aimed at curbi ng the 
violence at the festival. "When 
you get 30,000 to 40,000 people 
showing up that are intoxicatec!, 
bored and angry, you ' ve got prob-
lems. The band give the e people 
something to do, and stopping the 
band is not goi ng to \top the 
people from coming." ~aid UCSB 
student Julie Kind ig. 

Marshall College junior Mike 
Kinoshita attended the event in 
Isla Vista last yenr and aid that he 
had a po itive experience for the 
most part.

Most of the 
work will be 
aimed toward 
underrepresented groups, ac-
cording to the study's ChiefIn-
vestigator David Deitch, a clini-
cal professor of psychiatry at 
UCSD. 

Deitch said that women and 
minorities are generally 
underrepresented in private care, 
and "to motivate some of that popu-
lation toa higher education" about 
substance abuse treatment. 

Deitch said he hopes to im-
prove treatment by increasing the 
interaction between organized 
academia and the practical appli-
cation of field agencies. 

The new program will offer 
academic training to workers in 

vited to attend a 
fully-paid intensive summer 
training institute in addiction 
treatment in order to receive prac-
tical training in community ad-
diction programs. 

To establish the center, admin-
istrative committees will review 
and revise current curriculums, 
develop criteria to approve place-
ment sites and publicize the pro-
gram to interested students. 

Center organizers hope 10 work 
in the field with their refined cur-
riculums within six months. 

If all goes according to plan, 
the sumlJler institutes will be i 
operation by the end of the aca-
demic year.

Treasurer Blasts Wilson~s Veto 
State Treasurer Kathleen Brown criticized Gov. 

Pete Wilson's veto ot Senate Bill 589, which would 
have leveraged $6 million In existing funds from the 
Califomla Student Loan Authority to 'finance as much 
as $200 million in low-cost loans at fl)(ed rates. 

The Cal-Loans program would not have required 
additional General Fund funding, and the risk of loan 
defaults would have fallen on participating colleges, 
not the state, according to Brown. 

"The govemor's veto proves that he's out of touch 
with middle-income families who have to save and 
struggle to put their kids in college," said Brown, a 
likely gubernatorial candidate in next year's election. 
"He doesn't seem to understand that if we don't start 
taking care of middle-class Califomians, we won't 
have a middl~lass left to take care of. 

"This program is about stretching dollars further. 
It's Innovative. And It wouldn't have cost taxpayers a 
dime," Brown added. 

In his veto message, the govemor said that federal 
financial aid programs would be sufficient to meet the 
needs of Califomla students. 

Brown said that she plans to explore other options 
to assist middle-Income students and families, includ-
Ing the possible reintroduction of the bill next year. 

UCSD Profeuor Honored for

Glaucoma Talk Kicks Off Faculty 
Lecture Series Next Thursday 

Robert N. Weinreb, professor and vice chair of 
opthamology at the UCSD School of Medicine, will 
lecture on glaucoma, one of the two leading causes of 
blindness in the United States. at 4:30 p.m. on 
Thursday, Nov. 4. Weinreb 's presentation, the open· 
ing lecture of the UCSD School of Medicine's Faculty 
Distinguished Lecture Series, will take piace in Garren 
Auditorium in the Basic Science Building. 

A reception will follow in the Dean's Office Lobby. 
The lecture is free and open to the public. 

Glaucoma describes a group of conditions in which 
there is a loss of vision due to damage of the optic 
nerve, the cable at the back of the eye that transmits 
visual messages from the eye to the brain. Although it 
is not known what damages the optic nerve, recent 
research provides new insights and raises the possi· 
bility of more effective therapies than are currently 
available, according to Weinreb. 

Weinreb, a graduate of the Harvard Medical School, 
has been a member of the UCSD faculty for 10 years.

GSA Will Still Pay Autonomy Advocate 
VOTE: Carroll-Burke 
survives pay recall effort 
at Monday meeting 
By ErIc Schmidt 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Graduate Student Associa-
tion (GSA) reaffirmed its commit-
ment to gain autonomy from the 
University of California adminis-
tration at its Monday night meet-
ing when it voted to continue to 
pay its autonomy advocate. 

The GSA voted I ~ to eight, 
with three abstentions, to let Au-
tonomy Advocate Patrick Carroll-
Burke keep his SI,OOO per year 
salary, which is the same amount 
payed to GSA executive mem-
bers. 

Carroll-Burke said the 
ad vocate's salary means more than 
just money in his bank account. In 
order to show that it is serious 
about gaining autonomy, "The 
council needs to put its money 
where its mouth is," he said. He 
added that the position entails a 
great deal of work. 

Several members of the GSA 
had introduced a motion to recall 
Carroll-Burke's salary, saying the 
movement to gain autonomy had 
not been fully discussed and the 
position of autonomy advocate was 
iII-defined. 

GSA representative Mike 
O'Brien, one of the recall motion's 
sponsors, said the position of au-
tonomy advocate had not been 
sufficiently defined, nor was it 
clear that the advocate represents 
the views of the entire GSA coun-
cil. 

")' m still not sure what exactl y 
this position is supposed to be ad-
vocating," O'Brien said before the 
vote, 

Carroll-Burke said hecould not 
understand the confusion sur-
rounding the issue. " I'm bewil-
dered. I've explained it often 
enough in council. .. . We want 
control of our own funding and 
organizations and control over how 
and who we employ. We want our 
own internal procedural guide-
lines, not the [Policy and Proce-
dures Manual]," he said. 

Following the vote, 0 ' Brien 
said, ''The issue is dead for me 
personally. I don't want there to 
be unnecessary antagonism within 
the council." However, he said he 
was still dissatisfied with the defi-
nition of the autonomy advocate's 
role. 

The vote was the latest move in 
a year-long effon by the UCSD 
student governments to gain inde-
pendence from the campus admin-
istration. Student governments at 
UCLA and UC Berkeley have al-
ready gained autonomy, but at the 
newer campuses, they must still 
repon to the administration. 

Last year, Carroll-Burke was 
elected president of the GSA un-
der the premise that he would work 
toward autonomy. Monday's vote 
makes it clear that this year's coun-
cil, which is not an activistcouncil 
like it was under Carroll-Burke, 
still wishes to pursue autonomy. 

The move for autonomy got its 
first real push last year when the 
now-defunct University Center 
Board, under the leadership of 
Chris Burnett, tried to gain control 

of the $37.50 per student activity 
fee. 

Last year's co-op crisis also 
brought the issue of autonomy to 
the forefront. The Memorandum 
of Understanding between the 
UCSD student governments, ad-
ministration and student coopera-
tives, created to keep the co-ops 
on campus, contains a clause which 
slates that administration will par-
ticipate in negotiations for student 
government autonomy. 

Carroll-Burke said much of his 
emphasis on autonomy stems from 
the co-op crisis, which he said 
shows how powerless UCSD stu-
dent government is. 

''The GSA is basically a high-
school organization - you're al-
lowed to play democracy," Carro 11-
Burke said. "We don't object to 
administrative oversight. What we 
object to is arbitrary intervention. 

"We're not children, and we 
won't he treated as such," he added. 

Currently, Carroll-Burke said 
he is researching autonomy. He 
will probably enter negotiations 
with the administration Winter 
Quarter. 

Next week, the GSA will vote 
on a motion to transfer money 
allocated for legal fees to theevents 
budget. According to Carroll-
Burke, the legal fee will allow the 
GSA to obtain legal advice on 
how to pursue autonomy. 

In addition, he said, it could be 
used to help graduate students who 
are dealing with issues such as 
academic integrity.

Warren Residence Halls Wired for Cable 
By ErIc Schmidt 
Senior Staff Writer 

Students living in the newly 
refurbished Warren College resi-
dence halls and apartments got 
more than just nice furniture and 
unstained carpeting in their rooms. 
This year, residents gained free 
access to cable television stations 
through a pilot program created 
by UCSD's Telecommunications 
Services. 

According to the cable's Sys-
tem Manager Bob Greene, other 
colleges will eventually get cable 
service if the Warren program is 
successful. "If it is positively re-
ceived, we will move to test it at 
other [colleges I as well," he said.

However, one of Atkinson's

will review the possibility of cable

the end of this year. 

Warren College Resident Life 
Business Manager Chrystal 
Sugimura, who oversees the cable 
program at Warren, said the pro-
gram is being supplied free of 
charge for a one-year trial period. 
No additional housing charge has 
been assessed for Warren students 
this year. 

Although there is currently no 
charge for student use of the cable, 
"Students wind up paying for it 

percent of students on campus, a 
rise of a little over one percent 
since Atkinson came on board as 
chancellor. By comparison, UC 
Berkeley, which is also known for 
research, has a graduate student 
population of 20.3 percent. 

"Here we are, supposedly a re-
search-based campus, with a 
graduate student population which 
is ridiculously low," he said. . 

Atkinson tempered his com-
ments with optimism about the 
future. "We have not suffered un-
usual losses due to these bleak 
budget outlooks," he said, adding 
that the university was in a similar 

one way or another," Greene said. 
The program currently falls under 
the Housing and Dining Services 
budget. 

In addition to standard cable 
channels, Warren residents will 
also be able to create their own 
channels this year. 

According to Greene, each 
Warren apartment complex will 
be given its own station, to be 
overseen by the Warren Resident 
Dean's Office. 

''This is a very sophisticated 
system, and there are a lot of pos-
sibilities," Green said of the uses 
of cable on campus.

in the '80s," Atkinson said. 

The 1992-93 year was marked 
by an increase in private funding 
to UCSD, which put it fourth in 
the UC system. "We had our best

Vote 'Yes' on Proposition 170 
As the California legislature tries to make ends meet with 

declining state revenues, local school officials around the state 
have been forced to meet stricter budgets. Proposition 170 gi ves 
communities a greater opportunity to meet school-development 
needs by lowering the voting requirement for local bond mea-
sures sponsored by districts to develop and maintain the schools. 

Since the tax revolt of 1978 through the passage of Proposition 
13, school officials have found it more difficult to raise the 
revenue necessary for the construction, maintenance and renova-
tion of public schools. California continues to experience rapid 
enrollment growth in its public schools while the sta te continues 
to limit school funding. As a result, local school districts have 
increasingly resorted to sponsoring initiatives which support the 
purchase of local bonds financed primarily by property taxes. 
Time after time. schools' efforts to meet the educational needs of 
their communities have been frustrated. 

Proposition 170 gi ves more powerto local school officials in 
determining the educational needs of their own community. The 
proposal reduces the state's fiscal responsibility to its schools by 
shifting more responsibility to the community. The Guardiall 
urges you to vote "Yes" on Proposition 170. 

Vote 'Yes' on Proposition 172 
Everyone from Eureka to San Ysidro knows that the state of 

California has been in an economic bind for quite some time. As 
the recession lingers, the legil>lature is finding that it has fewer 
slices of the budgetary pie to dish out to hungry Californians. 

Proposition 172 would go a long way in alleviating that 
problem. The ballot initiative calls for extending a half-cent 
increase in the state sales tax to fund local police, fire and other 
public safety services. 

Even though Proposition 172 has nothing to do with higher 
education. it is absolutely in the best interests of the University of 
California for this measure to pass. If voters decide to monkey 
with the six percent sales tax, the state will have to make up the 
gap in local funding somehow. That means other portions of the 
budget will be cut, and as always, that places the UC system in a 
precarious situation. 

The defeat of 172 would almost cenainly mean a mid-year 
budget cut for unprotected state programs like higher education, 
and that' s something that the U ni versity of California can't afford 
right now. The Guardian urges you to vote "yes" on Proposition 
172. 

Vote 'No' on Proposition 174 
School voucher initiatives are an attractive alternative to 

solving the institutional crisis in our educational system, but 
hardly anything in Proposition 174 is attracti ve. By offering a 
$2,600 voucher for every student to attend a private school, the 
authors of the initiative hope to break the bureaucratic badge of 
inefficiency marked by the self-interests of the teachers' unions 
and by the continued marginal quality of education. But propo-
nents have only neglected to take into account some of the very 
imponant consequences that would result from its passage. 

One reality proponents neglect to mention is the limited 
capacity of private school space. Independent reseachers have 
discovered that private schools in California have only enough 
space to accommodate one percent of public school students. The 
initiative does not offer any subsidies or tax incentives for 
entrepreneurs to create enough private schools to absorb the 
influx of students who take advantage of the vouchers. The 
program cannot possibly create enough competition between 
public and private schools to meaningfully improve education. 

Proponents have also not fully calculat~d the impact Proposi-
tion 174 would have on the dynamics of the state budget. 
Proponents concede that the state does not have the budget 
resources needed to subsidize existing enrollment. The state 
would then be compelled to meet the budget shortfall caused by 
the initiative through spending cuts and higher taxes . 
This initiative will not save California millions of dollars. 

The initiative is too ill-planned for it to carry out an effective 
agenda for voucher programs. Passing this proposition would 
actually do the voucher movement an injustice. as the initiative 
would surely bring about a crisis in our educational system. The 
Guardian strongly urges you to vote "No" on Proposition 174.

FINDING SELF-ESTEEM IN

The would-be reformers' goal of 
raising students' self esteem is admi-
rable. No one can dispute that having 
confidence in yourself and your abili-
ties is vital for success and happiness. 
But the fact of the matter is, one can-
not breed success simply by lowering 
expectations. To get a better idea of 
the true factors which determine a 
child's success or failure in life. it is 
useful to look at the findings in a 
landmark study titled The Children of 
Kauai. 

The survey studied a group of chil-
dren from depressed academic back-
grounds on the island of Kauai, Ha-

But the factor that was found IllOSt 
important to building self-esteem 
wasn't biologica l or innate. Rather, it 
was whetherthe chi Id had a mentor or 
role model who encouraged and took 
an interest in the child. The person did 
not have to be a parent: the person 
could be a teacher, another rel,ltive or 
even a coach. 

Besides providing vital guidance 
and encouragement, the mentor gave 
the child an incentive to achieve by 
acting as a role model for the child to 
emulate. Even director John Singleton 
alluded to this in his Boys ill ,Ire Hood, 
emphasizing the importance of a strong 
father figure to provide guidance and 
direction for young black males.The 
findings of this study uggest that the 
process of building self-esteem is more 
complicated than many wou Id-be re-
formers suggest.

In fact, this socialistic vision of

CONGRESSWOMAN SHENK IS HypoCRITICAL IN MARSHAlL DEDICATION 
Editor: 

It was with great pleasure and a sense of 
pride that I attended Friday's dedication of 
Thurgood Marshall College. It is very excit-
ing, indeed, to finally put a name to the very 
diverse face of the former Third College; and 
I can think of no name which exemplifies the 
College's ideology and goals of social justice 
and equality than that of Marshall. However, 
Ii ving in an imperfect world. there was a dark 
cloud which loomed over what was otherwise 
a glorious afternoon: the presence and ad-
dress of Congresswoman Lynn Shenk was 
inappropriate for this momentous occasion. 

Just a few months ago, Lynn Shenk and 
Barbara Boxer made a highly visible media 
visit to the U.SJMexican border in order to 
support the proposals put forth by Gov. Pete 
Wilson to curb illegal immigration into the 
United States. [n order to secure the' votes of 
middle-class Anglo-Americans living in San 
Diego. Shenk has made a decision to stand 
shoulder-to-shoulder with Wilson on a plat-
form of hate directed at the Mexicano and 
Chicano communities. She has jumped on 
Pete Wilson's political bandwagon of mi-
grant bashing, supporting an agenda which 
would make Thurgood Marshall tum over in 
his grave. She stands in suppon of a measure 
which would revoke and deny the citizenship 
of children born in the United States by Mexi-
can parents, which is unconstitutional. She 
supports a measure which would deny the 
children of Mexicano families access to pub-
lic. school education, the very right which 
Justice Marshal spent his entire life fighting to 
guarantee for all people. And she supports a 
measure which would deny the children of 
migrant families access to health care, prefer-
ring to see Mexicano children suffer in the 
streets than receive adequate medical atten-
tion. 

Lynn Shenk is the embodiment of hypoc-
risy in American politics. and this was made 
evident when listening to the keynotepeaker, 
Marian Wright Edelman. Edelman, of course, 

HATTIS: Mentors and 
role models are better for

This instills into the individual the idea 
that by working hard, one can succeed and do 
something great. And some of these individu-
als will go on to do great things, but all at least 
are motivated to try to succeed. 

Unfortunately, while it is evident that the 
aforementioned factors help build self-esteem, 

is the founder of the Children's Defense Fund 
and her address focused upon relieving the 
pain of children, of all colors, who sufferfrom 
poverty. I watched the over-wrought gesticu-
lations of Shenk, exaggerated nods of the 
head in agreement, as Edelman spoke of cor-
recting the social ills which oppress children 
in the United States. But Lynn Shenk. in fact. 
is trying to contribute to the perpetuation of 
this oppression. She has chosen to build her 
political career on the skeletons of the Mexi-
can poor instead of using her power to cham-
pion the cause of the disenfranchised, fighting 
for equality and social justice, as Thurgood 
Marshall would have done.

Schmidt Igbores I ..... 
Of Freedom 
Editor: 

In response to Eric Schmidt's commentary 
titled "Unmasking the Face of Homophobia" 
in the Oct. 14 issue, I would like to provide an 
alternate opinion. Schmidt argues that public 
indifference toward gays who emerge from 
the closet is inadequate behavior: instead. 
everyone should suppon and applaud those 
who choose to publicize their homosexuality. 
This really disgusts me, for no one should tell 
me to support an action or concept I do not 
believe in or agree with. 

Whatever happened to freedom in this 
country? Why are we discouraged from ex-
pressing our true feelings and beliefs? Con-
trary to Schmidt's argument. I think hetero-
sexuals who don't want to concern them-
selves with homosexuality any more than 
necessary should have the freedom to carry 
out that decision. However, somehow our 
society has twisted the Constitution to imply 
that citizens cannot live their own lives ac-
cording to their own standards and determ;na-
tions of right and wrong. 

According to Schmidt, "By ignoring the 
problem of homophobia, ignorance and ha-

the sad fact is that some individuals are more 
blessed with innate talent or drive than others. 
And some children have the benefit of a 
concerned parent or other adult, while others 
face. at best. indifference. 

But there are some things that can be done 
to help, besides simply railing against the lack 
of family values and evils of a single parent-
hood. 

More minority school teachers should be 
hired so that more inner-city children have 
role models with whom they can identify. 

Big Brother programs and others that at-
tempt to provide mentors and young role 
models to young children should be encour-

!red become even more embedded in hetero-
sexual culture." ] for one am not about to jump 
with joy every time a gay exposes him or her 
self. I believe in freedom. Homosexuals can 
have their way of life. I can have my way of 
life; we can promote hatred or love, ignorance 
orenlightement; we;1s a pri vate organization, 
can refuse membership to an atheist becau~ 
we believe in God, and so on. 

Homosexuals who feel they need encour-
agement fortheir actions should exercise their 
right to form their own organizations, rather 
than passing legislation that forces everyone 
else to suppon them. They can believe what 
they want, you can believe what you want. 
and I can believe what I want. This is how a 
free society thinks and works.

Kudos for Gu_dian's 
Coming OUt Coverage 
Editor: 

Kudos to your publication for providing 
accurate, timely information about what many 
consider to be the most significant holiday of 
the lesbian, gay, transgender and bisexual 
community. In a time when homophobia is 
the only acceptable form of prejudice that 
remains, awareness of queer issues cannot be 
over-emphasized. 

The commentaries in the Oct. 14 issue by 
Michael Segura and Eric Schmidt were both 
insightfulandenlighteningandShannon Brady's 
aniclesin the Oct. II and Oct. 14 issues show an 
interest in the queer community reminiscent of 
that of Gaye Johnson. These reporters shou Id be 
commended for their talent and integrity.

Council Race Heats Up in Final Days 
By Philip Michaels 
News Editor 

With less than a week to go 
before Tuesday's election, the race 
between Harry Mathis and Peter 
Navarro for the San Diego City 
Council'sDistrictl seat has heated 
up, as both candidates try to dis-
tinguish themselves among vot-
ers. 

Malhis, a partner in a public 
relations firm, and Navarro, a UC 
Irvine economics professor, 
recieved the most votes in the Sept. 
21 primary election. Mathis and 
Navarro received 8,814 and 8.553 
votes respectively for the District 
1 seat, which represents La Jolla, 
University City, Del Mar Heights, 
Rancho Penesquitas and Carmel 
Valley. 

Both candidates agree that key 
issues for this election are San 
Diego's economy and future de-
velopment within the district. 
However, Math is and Na varro di f-
fer in their approaches to each 
issue. 

Mathis' economic plan con-
sists of keeping existing busi-
nesses in San Diego, encouraging 
development of new businesses 
within the city and luring compa-
nies to relocate here, according to 
Mathis Campaign Manager Scott 
Tillson. Tillson added that Mathis 
sees city government as a facili-
tator rather than a roadblock in 
this process. 

"The approach from Harry's 
side is recognizing what businesses 
need to survive," Tillson said. 

Navarro said he would draw on 
his background as a Harvard-
trained economist to deal with San 
Diego's slumping economy. He

as to the effectiveness of the new 
laws. "I really don't think it's go-
ing to do that much .. .. [People I 
might just choose to be more bois-
terous." 

Oneofthe main reasons for the 
statewide warning was the over-
whelming influx of students from 
outside of the Santa Barbara area 
at past Halloween festivals. Ac-
cording to Young, 84 percent of 
the I ,OOO-plus indi viduals arrested 
last year were from out of town. 

added that he will take a sector by 
sector approach, from the aero-
space to tourism industries, to fi nd 
ways to revitalize the city's 
economy. 

Navarro said that growth man-
agement will be a key issue, espe-
cially for District I, where the 
greatest amount of development is 
likely to occur. Navarro favors a 
controlled approach to growth 
management and blasted Mathis' 
record on the Golden Triangle 
Planning Commission. 

"I wouldn't want to run on his 
record. In my view, he's done a 
horrible job on the Golden Tri-
angle Planning Commission," 
Navarro said. 

According to Tillson, however, 
Mathis has a proven record of 
puttti ng plans put forward and pro-
ducing tangible results. 

The race between Mathis and 
Navarro has boiled down toaclash 
of images, as each candidate has 
tried (0 paint himself as the best 
one for the job while attacking the 
record of his opponent. 

As hedid in Ia.<;tyear's mayoral 
election, Navarro has positioned 
himself as an outsider to city hall, 
promising to "shake things up" if 
elected. 

Navarro emphasized his appeal 
to younger voters, stressing his 
vision and creativity. 

According to Navarro, "there ' s 
a cultural difference between 
Harry and I. He just doesn't get it 
when it comes to issues of sexual 
harassment, the environment and 
development. " 

During the campaign, Navarro 
has criticized Mathis for his close 
ties to developers, claiming that 

"We hope that you will help us. 
to alert students of the risks and 
possible penalties of coming to 
Isla Vista this Halloween - and 
then encourage them to stay away 
for their own protection," Young 
wrote in his letter to the other UC 
campuses. 

Director of Special Services 
Nick Aguilar, who forwarded the 
letter from Young to the deans of 
the five UCSD colleges, said that 
the letter was sent "in an effort to 
try to minimize the numberofvio-
lations of the law." 

However, Aguilar said that he

63 percent of donations to Mathis' 
campaign has come from mem-
bers of the development industry. 
Furthermore, Mathis' partner in 

. his public relations firm has ties to 
developers, which Navarro 
claimed is a clear conflict of inter-
est. 

"[Mathis is] much more will -
ing to go for growth at any COSt, 
whereas my view is ... if we don ' t 
manage our growth properly, it 
hurts our economy," Navarro said. 

Tillson dismissed Navarro's 
criticisms, pointing out that over 
900 people had contributed to 
Mathis' campaign. "Peter is try-
ing to run a campaign based on 
fear .... he tries to tear down his 
opponent and his record because 
we have a record torun on," Tillson 
said. 

The Mathis campaign strategy 
has been to emphasize his e)(peri-
ence and familiarity with city hall 
politics. To that end, Mathis has 
recei ved the endorsement of San 
Diego Mayor Susan Golding. 

"Harry, who has experience and 
knows how things work in the 
city .. . will know how to get a 
program that will benefit the dis-
trict and the city through the coun-
cil and through the bureaucracy," 
Tillson said. 

Navarro, who has received the 
endorsement of outgoing District 
I Councilmember Abbe 
Wolfsheimer, said that he would 
be able to work with one-time ri-
val Golding. 

Navarro also said that he has 
worked successfully with the 
council in the past and has a strong 
relationship with most of the 
council members. 

involved in traveling to Santa Bar-
bara. 

"I would hope that there would 
be viable alternatives in San Di-
ego," said Aguilar, adding that he 
thought the problem was probably 
caused by students from the Los 
Angeles area. 

"Our student body has better 
ways to spend theirtime than trav-
eling eight hours to be e)(posed to 
criminal prosecution," he said. 

"I'm glad UCSD doesn't have 
to spend lime ... [and] resources 
dealing with students that aren ' t 
enrolled here," Aguilar added.

Barbour's method works by 
stopping the enzyme before it is 
produced in the body. The method 
will not harm other cell functions 
in any way because it is specifi-
cally tailored to react only with 
PLAr 

Most medicines are somewhat 
indiscriminate. While they may 
help alleviate the symptoms of a 
disease, they carry with them so 
many side effects that sometimes 
they seem to do more hann than 
good. For example, chemotherapy 
is a common cancer-fighting strat-
egy that leaves patients hairless 
and ill. 

"There are a lot of non-speci fic 
inhibitors," Barbour said. "You 
can't be sure they won't affect 
[other enzymes]." 

A.S. Opens 
All-Night 
Study Lounge 
By Gina Fleschl 
Guardian Reporter 

Students can bum the midnight 
oil in the new, 24-hour library 
lounge above the Price Center The-
alfe. On Tuesday night, the lounge 

. kicked off its first all-night study 
session with free pizza and a mes-
sage from Associated Students 
Events Manager Nicole Kransy and 
Andy Pepper of UC Marketing, 
two of the lounge's organizers. 

In Ll collaborative effort, the 
A.S. and the University Centers 
Advisory Board (UCAB), are 
sponsoring the 24-hour study 
lounge. "[The 24-hour lounge] is 
one of our big, cooperative efforts 
to benefit students," said UCAB 
Chair Aaron Goodman. 

Between midnight and 6 am., 
UCSD police will monitor the 

The new method, on the other 
hand, affects only PLA" thanks to 
"antisense RNA technology." 
Antisense blocks PLA,'s produc-
tion, instead of chemically strik-
ing out at PL~ lind related en-
zymes indiscriminately. 

Enzymes are created in a cellu-
lar biochemical factory in which 
DNA is the designer. The DNA 
sends out a messenger, which then 
makes a template that builds the 
PL~ enzyme and other proteins. 
An antisense molecule attaches to 
the messenger directly, prevent-
ing PLA2 production. 

More research into the effects 
of PL~ is necessary, since its 
function is not fully known. The 
enzyme may be crucial \0 the con-
struction of cell membranes. In 
that case, the researchers must walk 
a tightrope, being careful to re-
duce the presence of the enzyme 
without destroying it entirely. 

"We observed that if the en-
zyme is important for cell func-

tion, then if we give a drug, we 
want to be careful of the level," 
Dennis said. "We have to find 
some way to walk that line - it 
can be a good enzyme and a bad 
enzyme [at the same time)." 

Dennis and Barbour used the 
method to identify one form PLAl , 
but Dennis said the method is not 
intended to be used as a drug in 
this case'. "This is a specific way 
[to do] basic scientific studies," he 
said. Several local companies are 
using the method to develop more 
specific drugs, though. 

The problems associated with 
the production of an actual drug are 
very complex, si nce "you've got to 
feed them to somebody," Dennis 
said. In fact, Dennis believes the 
likely drug to stop PLA1 will be a 
simple, non-specific chemical in 
the tradition of other simple drugs 
like aspirin or penicillin. 

Barbour's study has brought 
the development of such a drug 
one step closer.

food and sip free coffee provided 
by Espresso Roma Cafe. The A.S. 
was inspired to change the hours of 
the lounge, which used to close at 
'midniaht, by the fact that most col-
leges have a 24-hour saudy lounge. 

"For students living on or off 

campus, it's the first place on cam-
pus where they can study, relax and 
bring food all night long," said 
Kransy, who has worked since the 
beginning of Fal I Quarter to create 
the new hours. She added that the

eighth straight. in five unexpectedly 
cJosesets, 13-15. 15- 11. 14-16. 15-
10,16-14. 

Game one began innocently 
enough, with UCSD's mostly-fre h-
man lineup charging out to a 13-9 
lead. only to come from ahead to 
lose the final six points and drop the 
first set. 15-13. 

With the embarrassing prospect 
of going down 2-0 versus a team 
that is in its first year of women' s 
volleyball. UCSD collected itself 
and grabbed the second set. 15-1 I. 

With momentum seemingly on 
their side. the Triton youngsters 
stormed on to a game-three advan-
tageof 14-6. Needingonly a point to 
take the set. UCSD sat back on its 
heels and watched Chapman rip off 
the next 10 points en route to an 
inspired 16- 14 win .

lineup at home against the hapless 
Panthers (2-19). whom UCSD (18-

Tritons Ground U CR, 
Eye Bruin Heights 
WATER POLO: UCSD continues its domination of 
Riverside, sets sights on top-five ranked UCLA 
By Brian K. Hutto 
Sports Editor 

UCSD men' water polo Head 
Coach Denny Harper's biggest fo· 
cus going into last night 's UC Riv-

erside decima· 
tion was, to no 
one's surprise, 
just win. 

But it is not 
the lowly 9· 16 
Highlanders, a 
pitiful squad the 
Tritons rou -
tinely pummel, 
that conce rns 
Harper. It is the 
UCLA Bruins. 

"We are re-
ally looking towards UCLA on Sat-
urday," Harper said. "As long as 
J've coached here, there are a hand-
ful of games that I carry around in 
my pocket where the crowd can 
playa huge factor. People can have 
a real effect on thi s game. 

''The crowd can be a big factor in 
[the UCLA gamel," Harper said. 
"But they have to come to scream 
and yell and make a lot of noise." 

"It's the biggest game of our 
season," co-captain Richard Romero 
said of this Saturday'S 6 p.m. home 
showdown with the top-five ranked 
Bruins. "It is a perfect opportunity 
for us to beat a team that' s mnked 
ahead of us." 

Harper also acknowledged yet 

another demolishing of UCR. The 
Tritons added to their previous 23-4 
and 21-3 drowning of the lowly 
Highlanders with a 17-5. smashing. 

''This group really wants a chal-
lenge, this is not a challenge -
UCLA is." Harper said of the game. 
"Our main emphasis is UCLA: ' 

There was one bright spot for the 
hapless Highlanders: they actually 
won the opening sprint. But things 
went downhill from there. 

Leading-scorer Michael Nalu 
initiated the slaughter by forcing a 
kick out and receiving a pass from 
Andrew Steinheimer to convert the 
six-on-five opportunity. 

Romero found the cuge seconds 
later. Setting hole. he mercilessly 
turned hi s helpless defender and 
rifled a shot past UCR goalie Steve 
Palmer. 

TIle Tritons must have taken a liking 
to Palmer, because they were knocking 
on his doorstep all night long. Knock-
ing down his entire house is more like 
it UCSD allowed only two shots-on-
goal and held a6-1 advantage after the 
first quarter. 

Nalu's four-goal total told noth-
ing of the damage he could easily 
huve inflicted upon the Highland-
ers, who couldn't guard him at the 
two-meter position or outside. N alu 
netted his obligatory stats and fed 
the rest of the Triton stat padding 
squad. 

At halftime, UCSD was up 9-1 .

Goalie Andy Bruce atuffs. akIp shot In Trltona' 17-5 win over UCR, 

At the end of the third quarter, it was 
13-3 and Harper had seen enough, 
sending his starting squad to the 
showers and inserting an all-sub 
lineup, 

The subs picked up where the 
starters left off. Dan Aufhauser, Luke 
Downer and Trey Best led the final 
attack. The buzzer mercifully ended 
the game, 17-5. 

UCSD's warm-up for the Bruins 

was marred by the results of co-
captain Sean Kinghorn 's early shoul-
derinjury, Harper said he will beout 
three weeks to three months, but he 
expects to have him back for the 
WWPA Championships Nov. 19-
21. Either way, he will bea no-show 
for Saturday. 

"We are down to one left-
hander," Romero said. "Losing 
[Kinghorn] really hurts us."

OK, so may~ ABC was looking 
for something different. Before the 
Chiefs game earlier this year. they 
had Vanessa Wi lliams singing "Sav-
ing the Best for Last" as they showed 
highlights of Joe Montana 's career, 
Vane sa Williams? That's about as 
wimpy as that Tinkerbe ll they show 
durin g Channel Five's Mighty 
Ducks hockey games. 

In the past, ABC had Bon lovi 
singing. While notmyfavoritegroup 
in the world , i f they had done "Blaze 
of Glory" or "Dead or Ali ve," it 
wouldn ' t have been so bad. But no, 
it wasol ' Jon himself crooning about 
a "bed of roses." The only roo e that 
a football player will be seeing are 
those he recei ves after hi s seventh 
knee operation. 

What's next, Julio Iglesias and 
Willie Nelson si nging 'To All the 
Teams )' ve Watched Before?"' Or 
Kenny Rogers anJ Dllll) Pallon's

we're rootillg fori Is/a lids ill the

Now, rm not the biggest coun· 
try-music fan in the world, but I'm 
sure it appeals to a huge section of 
the regular Monday Night Football 
audience . How about Garth Brooks 
regularly? Or Alan Jackson or Clint 
Black? Those ure some tough guys 
who could stiff·arm Amy Grant to 
the turf with little difticulty.

UCSD Cages Azusa 
Pacific, Bi-ola Means 
MEN'S SOCCER: Tritons stomp Biola Eagles and 
Azusa Pacific Cougars for their 11 th straight win 
ByKenP ....... 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's soccer team 
has played over three and a half 
hours of soccer in the past two days 

MENI~ 
.. t·. I!'" 

and has 
only three 
goals to 
show for it. 

UCSD remained lackadaisical in 
the second half as well, Despite sev-
eral shots, the Tritons couldn't find 
the back of the net. Again Madden 
and the UCSD defenders took 
charge, shutting down the Eagles 
completely. Neither team could pro-
duce anoffense. and the game moved 
into overtime a scoreless tie. 

UCSD Head Coach Derek 
Armstrong attributed his team's lack 
of offensive power to the Tritons' 
fatigue from a tough game against 
Cal Lutheran on Sunday.

S till, 
those three 
g 0 , a I s 
proved 
goo d 
enough to 
give the 
Tritons 
wins over 
Biola Uni-

"We didn't play particularly 
well," Armstrong said. "[The team) 
had a bit of a letdown after the game 
on Sunday." 

Todd Curran (rllht) scored the wlnnlneeoalln UCSD's OT win over Biola and had another versus APU, 

versity and 
Azusa Pacific and raise theiroverall 
record to 15-2-1 in preparation for 
the upcoming NCAA Division III 
playoffs. 

. On Tuesday, the Tritons matched 
up against NAIA foe Biola Univer-
sity at Triton Soccer Stadium. De· 
spite the sunny San Diego skies, 
UCSD's offense was gloomy, man-
aging just three weak shots in the 
entire first half, 

The Eagles didn't fare much bet-
ter. Triton goalie Michael Madden 
and the rest of the miserly UCSD 
defense shut down Biola, not allow-
ing a single first-half shot. 

The first overtime period came 
and went and neither team had put 
any points on the board. 

Finally, with just six seconds 
remaining to play in the second over-
time, UCSD's Todd Curran took a 
pass from the left side of the field 
and banged it into the bottom left-
hand comer of [he goal to give San 
Diego a 1-0 win. 

Entertaining back-to-back con-
tests, the Tritons welcomed Azusa 
Pacific to town yesterday. The Cou-
gars arrived at UCSD with a 7-6-4 
record and in the end, proved to be 
no threat to the Tritons, who glided 
to an easy 2-0 win. 

While the team's leading scor-

ers, Chris Romey and Robert Ripley, 
watched the start of the contest from 
the bench, Armstrong took the op-
portunity to look at some of his 
players who don ' t normally get 
much playing time. 

The move proved especially im-
portant, since Armstrong must cut 
his 25-man roster to 18 before the 
playoffs in two weeks. 

Both teams were content to play 
kickball until UCSD took charge a 
little more than eight minutes into 
the game. 

Freshman defender Brian Turner 
found Curran streaking down the 
right side and hit him with a pass. 

Curran quickly controlled. 
dribbled and then knocked a rolling

into the bottom left-hand corner of 
the goal. 

Neither learn was willing to take 
control after the goal, and UCSD 
found itself up 1·0 heading to the 
locker room. 

With just under 30 minutes left 
in the game, Armstrong inserted 
starters Ripley and Romey into the 
lineup for a light workout, giving 
the Tritons unbeatable firepower, 
which enabled them (0 dominate the 
pace. 

With just under two minutes to

GREGG 

WHEnn 
Mondays with 
Garth Brooks 

We here at the Gllardiall 
sports office are very con-
cerned with what goes on in 
the world around us. We 
devote several hours each week 
to discussion of the major 
issues of the day: Somalia, 
health care, etc. But a topic 
raised just yesterday has 
caused so much consternation 
withi n the haughty, intellectual 
circle that is our office. that we 
decided we must share it with 
you: the Monday Night 
Football theme song. 

We broached this fiery 
subject when Defender Ken 
brought it to our attention that 
he had turned on the game 
Monday Night, expecting an 
old-fashioned brawl between 
NFC Central Division rivals 
Minnesota and Chicago. It 
started out with Frank Gifford 
pumping up the game as the 
opening theme blared and the 
computer-generated Viking 
and Bear helmets crashed. 

The UCSD Guardian 

It was time for some face-
mask-crunching, shoulder-pad-
popping, rough-and-tumble, 
break-out-the-12-pack-of-
Natural Light-and-the-cheese-
doodles football action. And 
then came Amy Grant. 

Jason Rltcnle/l>uardlan 
Senior defender Michelle Carbone and the rest of the Triton defense have played a dominant role In UCSO's near perfect season. 

There really is no way to 
describe it. according to the 
Defender. As Ken put it. he 
was nearly bursting with pent-
up aggression and ready to 
explode at the first quarterback 
sack, when Amy Grant 
sudden ly popped up on the 
screen and started singing 
about how the "Bears and the 
Vikings will put your heart into 
motion." 

Another Two Bite the Dust 
WOMEN'S SOCCER: Wins against Occidental, 3-0, and USC, 3-2, keep the Tritons' undefeated at 13-0-1 

Now, [didn't have to 
witness it to get a sense of the 
shock and horror that must 
have set in on the millions of 
stogie-chomping, bratwurst-
downing, nacho-slurping, die-
hard football fans at the first 
sight of cute little Amy Grant 
prancing around the screen 
holding cute little babies 
dressed in cute little Bears and 
Vikings pajamas. 

Remember the good old 
days? The last couple of years 
ABC had Hank Williams Jr. 
singing "Are You Ready For 
Some Football?" Yes, Hank we 
were. Hank was cool. That 
song set just the right mood for 
an evening of semi-controlled 
violence. Amy Grant. on the 
other hand. just gets you in the 
mood to perfonn your own

That victory, combined with a 
3-0 triumph over Occidental on 
Monday, kept San Diego's al-
most perfect record intact at 13-
0-1 with only one contest remain-
ing in the season. 

Monday's effort against the Ti-
gers at Occidental was supposed to 
be a guaranteed win for the Tritons. 
For the first 18 minutes, it was.

Only seven minutes into the 
game, UCSD's Ele Johnson took a 
pass from teammate Eva Kingsbury 
and converted to gi ve the Tritons 
the early lead. 

Five minutes later, Johnson was 
the one with the assist when she fed 
Carin Pugh a ball that Pugh neued 
for a 2-0 lead. 

The Tritons' final score came 
18 minutes into the game when 
Johnson had the ball on the left wing 
and crossed it to the center. Instead 
of waiting for a Triton to deflect it 
in, Johnson's ball sailed into the 
back comer on the fly, giving the 
fre hman her second goal of the 
game. 

Occidental turned the game 
around soon after. WhiJe the Tigers 
didn't even get a shot off, let alone 
score, they nonethless started tak-
ing it to UCSD. 

"We allowed ourselves to be 
knocked around," UCSD Head 
Coach Brian McManus said. "We're 
letting teams that aren't as good as 
us push us around."

HIATUS 2 The UCSD Guardian 

THEATER 

The Revenger's Tragedy 
Perverse hurrwr obscures storyline in faulty 

Sledgehammer Theatre production 

Cyril Tournt>ur's "The 
Revenger's Tragedy" is a t1 ve-act 
festival of rape. murder, incest, 
bathroom humorand various other 
forms of debauchery. In other 
words. this J:Jcobean verse drama 
is perfect fare forthescatologica lly-
inclined, B-movie-inspired creative 
team at Sledgehammer Theatre. 

Sinl:e co-founding Sledgeham-
mer Theatre eight years ago, artis-
tic director Scott Feldsher has al-
W:Jys delighted in stagi ng perver-
sion. Past productions such as 
"Brain Fever," "Pre-Paradise" and 
"Sorry Now" were noteworthy pri-
m:Jrily for their all-consuming bad 
taste and vain attempts at shocking 
audiences. With "The Revenger's 
Tragedy," emphasis seems to be 
placed on bodily fluids. Feldsher 
h:Js found a way to scatter blood, 
phlegm. urine and semen across 
the stage. The result is not particu-
larly dramatic, but it sure is slip-
pery. 

In fact, several hydroplaning 
actors nearly fell on their feces-

Staff Writer 

er, faces - during Sunday' s open-
ing night performance. Sadly, these 
sporadic near-falls provided most 
of the excitement. 

The plot of "The Revenger's 
Tragedy" is extraordinari ly s imple. 
The protagonist Vindice, (Bruce 
McKenzie). plots revenge on the 
Duke (Robert Larsen) for murder-
ing his fiancee and along the way 
gets caught up ina variety of sub-
plots and coun termoves sponsored 
by his nemesis, Lussurioso (Walter 
Murray), the Duke's son. 

Despite this linear, no-nonsense 
form , the Sledgehammer produc-
tion makes it extremely difficult to 
figure out who is doing what to 
whom, and why. In their efforts to 
leave their stamp on each scene, 
the producers have neglected to 
provide the audience with enough 
basic information to follow the 
storyline. Th is is a big problem. In 
a battle of intrigue and treachery, it 
is always helpful to know who is 
being honest. deceitful or reneging 
on a promise. Most of the time I 

had no idea. 
Since the production doesn't 

bother to illuminate those an-
noying lillie plot details, the au-
dience has lillie to do but laugh 
as the cast plays with corpses 
and body parts. Occasionally this 
kind of humor is sufficiently di-
verting. It 's worth a chuckle, for 
instance, when Ambitioso (Kevin 
Mann) and Supervacuo (James 
Kresser) play soccer with an 
officer'sskull-especially since 
the two brothers are Siamese 
twins joined at the waist and can't 
bend over to pick up the skull. 

Much like the plot, however, 
the humor is not sustained . 
Ambitiosoand Supervacuo poke 
and prod each other constantly 
throughout the show, and at each 
interval their exchange becomes 
a little more grating. Overall , the 
comedy is ineffective. Occa-
sional bursts of black humor are 
insufficient payback for three 
hours and 15minutesofmytime.

Pearl Jam 
Vs .. 

Courtesy of Lance Mercer 
Pearl Jam 15 ('rom left): Dave Abbruzzese, Mike 
McCready, Stone Gossard, Jeff Ament and Eddie 
Vedder. 

Compelled by anger and a need 
to address the problems of the 
world today , Pearl Jam has de-
cided to take a crack at social is-
sues ranging from abuse to be-
trayal on Vs, the band's newest 
release. 

The album begins wi th Pearl 
Jam 's telltale driving drum and 
bass line on "Go," a song which 
deals with abuse and revenge in a 
relation ship . Vocalist Eddie 
Vedder also lashes out at police 
brutality ("W.M.A."), parasitic 
debauchers (URats") and authori ty 
in general ("Drop the Leash"). 

Despite the strength of the mes-
sages contained on Vs., Pearl Jam 
fails to deliver the level of musical 

innovation that propelled Tell, its 
1991 major label debut. 

Many of the songs on V.I'. repli-
cate the syncopated-funk rhythm 
which Pearl Jam made famous on 
Tell and played a major role in 
putting it at the front of the grunge 
phenomenon . 

With the exception of a couple 
of blues songs and an acoustic 
piece, few of the songs on V.\'. stray 
from the old pattern . The musical 
rut the band fall s into is both list-
less and predictable. 

Pearl Jam will perform Tues-
day and Wednesday with Ameri-
can Music Club at the Civic The-
atre. Both shows are sold out.

Continued from page H2 

Despite these narrative short-
comings, Feldsher must be ap-
plauded for his consistently bril -
liant collaborations with design-
ers. Robert Brill's two-tiered set 
for "The Revenger's Tragedy" is 
an elegant, theatrical illustration 
of deconstructionist theory. The 
design features fragments of an 
a'ncient building crashing down 
on a contemporary office struc-
ture, providing room for both si-
multaneous action and contradict -
ing images on stage. 

Chris Kortum'S high-tech light-
ingdesign is both surreal and hard-
edged, and his bright co lors make 
clever use of Brill' s white con-
struction. 

Costum e designers Jani ce 
Benning and Michelle Riel bring a 
keen sense of wit and functior. to 
their design., helping to clarify 

c haracters and ullegia nces 
throughout the scenes.

The Economics of the Gtibank 
Classic Visa card. How Student Discounts and Price 
Protection contribute to upward growth. A variety of factors have been 
suggested as contributing to the economic growth of students, including (I) more lottery winners 
between the ages of 18 and 22, (2) a 37% increase on earnings from bottle and can returns, (3) more 
students doubling earnings in the lightning round of game shows, and (4) the Citibank Classic VISa~ 

. 

carel. It' this last one, however, that affects most students. ~ The Citibank Classic Visa card otrers 
immediate savings to tudent card members. You can save up to 26% on long distance calls versus AT&T 

with the free Citibank Calling Service"" from MCI! And you can capitalize on a $20 Airfare Discount 
for domestic flights? Savings on mail order pur-

chases, sports equipment, magazines and music 

also abound. Maximize these savings with a low 

variable interest rate of 15.4%3 and no annual fee, 

and you can significantly improve your personal 

bottom line (especially if one's net income tends

even have enough savings to reinvest in a CD or two (the musical kind, of course). ~ On the way to the 
record store, or any store for that matter, take stock of the 3 services concerned with purchases made on 

the Citibank Classic card. Citibank Price Protection assures one of the best prices. See the same item 

advertised in print for less, within 60 days, and Citibank will refund the difference up to $150.4 To protect 
.. these investments, Buyers Security"" can cover them against accidental damage, fire or theft (ordinarily 

causes for Great Depressions) for 90 days from the date of purchase.4 And Citibank Lifetime 
Warranty"" can extend the expected service life of eligible products up to 12 years.s ~ But perl1aps the 

features which offer the best protection are your eyes, your nose, your mouth, etc. -all featured on The 

Photocard, the credit card with your photo on it. Carrying it can help prevent-fraud or any hostile 

takeover of your card. (Insiders peculate that it makes quite a good student 10, too.) Even if one's card is 
stolen, or perhaps lost, The Lost Wallet"" Service can replace your card usually within 24 hours. ~ So 

never panic. As we aU know panic, such as in the Great Panics of 1837, 1857, and 1929, can cause a 

downswing in a market. But with 24-hour Customer Service, there's no reason for it. A question about 

your account is only an 800 number away. (Panic of the sort experienced the night before Finals is 
something else again.) ~ Needless to say, building a credit history with the support of such services can 
only be a boost. You're investing in futures-that future house, that future car, etc. And knowing the 

itibank Classic Visa card is there in your wallet should presently give you a sense of security, rare in 

today' - how shall we say? - fickle market. ~ To apply, caU. Students don't need a job or a cosigner. And 
calJ if you'd simply like your photo added to your regular Citibank Classic Visa card. Here's the num-

ber: 1-800-CITIBANK, extension 19. ~ The Law of Student 

Supply and Demand states, "If a credit card satisfies more of a 

student's unlimited wants and needs, w.hile reducing the Risk 

Factor in respect to limited and often scarce resources-with 

the greatest supply of services and savings possible- then stu-

dents will demand said credit card." So, demand away-call.
