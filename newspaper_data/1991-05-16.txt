-Students Rally, Sign Letters 
Protesting Fee Increases 
• Representatives will travel to protest 
at meeting of board of regents today 
By Melinda Hamilton 
Associate News Editor 

In an attempt to raise student 
awareness about what students can 
do to fight the 40 percent fee in-
crease slated for next year, the Uni-
versity of California Student A 0-
ciation (UCSA) and the A.S. Exter-
nal Affairs Office co-sponsored a 
rally yesterday in the Price Center. 

The rally was coordinated with 
rallies and sit-ins that took place 
simultaneously at each of the other 
eight UC campuses. 

The UCSD rally 's open micro-
phone attracted faculty and staff as 
well as students. Students could also 

ign letters and postcard urging leg-
islators to raise taxes rather than cut 
education budget funds. 

Jeremy Pasternak, UCSD repre-
entative to the UeSA, appealed to 

students to ign copies of a form 
letter, which will later be ent to 
Governor Pete Wilson and the UC 
Board of Regents. 

"We're trying to save you$650a 
year,"Pastemak told thecrowd. "All 
students have to do is ign your 
name and write a few sentences."

City Council Votes to Delay Beach Alcohol Ban; 1992 Vote Likely 
By Ben Boychuk 
Senior Staff Writer 

Citizens who wi h to drink alco-
hol on the shores of San Diego ' 
beaches will be allowed to do so -
at least for the time being. 

Citing its unwillingne s to spend 
nearly half a million dollars for a 
special referendum, the San Diego 
City Council voted unanimously on 
Monday to repeal its ban on alco-
holic beverage consumption at city 
beaches and parks. But the council 
indicated that it would eek to rein-
troduce some of the ban 's restric-
tions, possibly as early as this sum-
mer. 

The ban, passed by the council in 
an effort to reduce crime and noise 
caused by exces ive drinking at lo-
cal beaches and parks, has been a 
point of controversy ince it was 
approved in February. 

The council 's decision on Mon-
day came after opposition groups 
such as the People to Ban the Ban, 
financed by local alcohol di tribu-
tors, submitted a petition containing 
the signatures of over 45,000 regis-
tered voters, requiring the city to put 
the issue on the ballot within the 
next 11 months. 

The only city election scheduled 
during the mandated II -month pe-

riod is the city council district pri-
maries, to be held this November. 
However, the primaries only cover 
four of the city ' eight council dis-
tricts. According to San Diego City 
Clerk Charles Abdelnour, the city 
would have to pay $450,000 to reach 
the electorate in the remaining four 
districts. 

As a re ult of the city 's severe 
financial re triction , the council 
decided that $450,()()() was too high 
a price to pay, and had no other 
alternative but to rescind the ban. 

"I don't believe we should be 
placing thi on the ballot ... if it ' 
going to cost u a half-million dol-

lars," said Counci lwoman Abbe 
Wolfsheimer, a supporter of the ban 
and who e district includes UCSD. 

The majority of the council -
with the exception of Mayor 
Maureen O'Connor, who has op-
posed the ban from its inception -
regarded Monday 's decision as a 
temporary setback. O'Connor, how-
ever, contend that existing law are 
sufficient to control public drunk-
enne . 

Until the i ue is resolved in the 
next general election, Wolf heimer 
said headvocate e tablishing pe-
cialdrinking"nodes" on the beaches.

In all major cmeg rie\ except robbery, the number of 
crimes reported on campusc was less than Ihat 
reported by 54 law en forcement agencies ervin commu-
nities \ ith populations f 100,000 or more, according lO

in 1989 to 69 in 1990. 

ampu& crime mtcS are calculated through the Federal 
Bureau of Lnvesti"ation 's Uniforn1 Crime Reporting Pro-

Crimes counted under the FBI program are will ful 
homicide, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated a au It, bur-
glary, larceny- theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson. Mi -
demeanors and infractions are not counted.

BAN: City council ends beach prohibition 
Continued from page 1 
The " node" would be pecific ar-
eas on the beach where drinking 
would bepermined, and which could 
be easily parrolled by police. One 
Wolf heimer aide likened the pc-
cial drinking areas to the smoking 
and non- moking ections found in 
re taurant . The pecial areas would 
be creared on beache in Ocean 
Beach, Missio n Beach, Pa ific 
Beach, and La Jolla. 

Opponents of the ban, especially 
local bu inc owners, were pleased 
wi th Monday 's decision. Terry 
Konja, owner of Geri ' W e I li-
quor and Deli in La Jolla, said he 
was "very happy" wi th the counei I' s 
decision . .. It is penect for us, " he 
aid, becau ea ban would havedone 

irreparable damage 10 his business. 
"J would have 10 I my life invest-

ment," Konja explained, estimating 
that 85 percent of hi busines comes 
from 'elling beer to beachgoers. 

Linda Jo Hardison , co-owner of 
Ihe Neighbor Saver Market in La 
Jolla and a member of the People to 
Ban the Ban committee, called the 
ban "complete overkill ," but did not 
con ider the council's action a total 
victory, 

"The public poke out, and they 
didn' t like the law," Hardi on said, 
But she added Ihat she would have 
to "wait and see" what fu ture action 
the counci l will take before hecon-
siders the controversy to be over. 

"We would liketocome to tenns 
[with the city) with a mutual com-
promise," Hardison aid. 

H ardison called Wolfsheimer's 
proposal to segregate drinkers from 
non-drinkers "preposterou " and 

"n I fea ible," and reiterated the 
banoppo ition'sstancelhanhebe I 
way to curb crime and rowdiness is 
to enforce the exi ting laws. 

Daved Fremont, former pre i-
dentoflhe CSDG mduateStudent 
A ociation , said that he was "grati-
fied that the i ue is going before the 
city (in 1992)," adding that pUlling 
thb issue on the bal lot "is the ab 0-
lutely preferred scenario." 

" They're a hazard to 
themselves and to the 
community, They're out 

there hooting and 
hollering until two in the 
morning. It's ridiculous, 

" DAVID KAY 
La Jolla homeowner 

"TIlisi anis ueinwhi hthecity 
council has heard from the property 
owners. ow they will be able to 
hear from the reM of the San Diego 
community," Fremont aid. 

Residents living near the beach 
did not hare Fremont's sentiment . 
David Kay, a homeowner who lives 
acros the treet from La Joll a 
Shore, de cribed the condilions 
before the ban as "hell aciou :' 

Kay said that, before the ban, 
finding broken bottles and empty 
beer can cluttering his lawn was 
the norm. 

"They're a hazard to them elve 
and to the community," Kay said. 

"They're out there hooting and 
hollering until two in the morning. 
It ' ridi ul us." 

ameron Volker. a resident li v-
ing two blocks from La Jolla Shores 
'aid the difference before the ban 
wa in pia e and afterward wa "like 
night and da •. " 

.. \ hen the ban wason, there wa 
no trouble at all:' olker said. 

Both Kayand olker agreed lhat 
Wolfsheimer'S plan would do noth-
ing to solve the problem. 

''They' ll all j u I crowd into the 
drinking se lion, and nothing will 
change," Kay said. 

"TIle neighbors are fed up, and 
they have every right to be," 
Hardison said. "But th ' beaches are 
public. and just be ause the people 
live nc::xt to the beach, that doesn' t 
mean it is their cxclu ively." 

"Clearly there is a IlI1e that need: 
to be drawn about unacceptable be-
havior," Fremont said. "Apply Ihe 
law to those wh cros the line." 

Fremom said that he felt it was 
un~ rtunatethat il took the re~ource~ 
of alcoh I di tributors to get the 
issue n the ballot, and indicated 
that t11l: alcohul ban is neverthele~s 
an issue which could motivate ~ tu­
dents I vote. 

Describing the student \,oting rate 
at UCS D as "abysmal," Frem nt 

expres~ed hope that tudents would 
take the time to ote on the i ... ~ue. 
"When we l~tudenbJ deal with the 
city council , they ju~t look at us and 
say, 'Why should we care aboul 
you? Students don't vOle.' Hope-
fully the alcohol will ga lvanize the 
ludents t vote in 1992," Fremont 

said .

The admittance system, according 
to the director of Y AF, hould be 
color-blind, therefore giving benefits to 
nobody, regardless of an impoverished 
background, underrepre e ntation , or 
gender. 

Some members of the group cla im 
that they are not racists, and that they 
do not feel jeopardized - as white 
male - by increa ing student of color 
enrollment: yet I truly wonder about 
this group's intention in a society 
where is ues of low income and 
discrimination are so obvious but have 
become invi ible to groups like this. 

If these young Americans had 
grown up in an area where the living 
conditions were sub-human, where 
arety is non-existent, where the 

education is de picable, surely their 
flyers would have been singing a 
wholly different tune. Incidentally, all 
of the above are characteristics of areas 
where the majority of people of color 
live . in addition to some of the Y AF' s 
poor white brethren. 

Ayers like these promote the notion ' 
that some of the minorities on campus 
might not posess the academic merit 
characteristic of other white students 

who have been admitted without 
"special treatment. " 

I think not. Every tudent on this 
campu , regardles of ethnicity or 
gender, deserves to be here because of 
their academic standing. 

Before I continue. I would like to 
inform the Y AF that the Univer ityof 
California sy tern does not use a quota 
system. 

Clearly, 
if the 
group 
would 
have 
known 
thi , it 
may have 
reconsid-
ered the 
location 
of its 
flyer . 

White students have 
always had - and 

continue to have -
the upper hand on 
better education, 
better living cond~ 
tions, and better 
opportunities. 

This issue of quotas, which Y AF's 
flyers address, seems to be an isolated 
complaint on the surface. 

Yet I uggest that there is a 
constant theme underlying not only 
this complaint, but also that of 
affirmative action , multiculturalism, 
and historical revisionism on U.S. 

See DISCRIMINATION. Page 5 

Thursday, May 16, 1991 The UCSD Guardian 

DISCRIMINATION: Whites have always had the 
upper hand when it comes to better opportunites 
Continued from page 4 
campuse . 

There is a broader political 
agenda being addressed here -
one of accepted norms and 
political attitude establi hed by 
our founding fathers (and 
mothers) slowly being uncovered 
and shown both {or what they are 
and for the kinds of things they 
have caused in American history. 

Policies like affirmative 
action and the quota system are a 
threat to the monopoly which 
one race and gender has continu-
ally had over the goings-on of 
this country. 

1 am not quick to accu e 
those opposing policies such as 
affirmative action and the quota 
system as racist. but I will say 
that only those who are ignorant 
of what women and people of 
color have endured just to gain 
entrance into institutions of 
higher learning would express 
such ideals. The quota for blacks 

was zero in political and educa-
tional arenas for centuries. 

A color-blind system i what 
the Y AF wants. 

But we cannot have a color-
blind y tern when the people 
who are running it see color and 
gender as a basis for judgement. 
Contrary to the claims of the 
Y AF, temporary policies like 
affirmative action and the quota 
system are not institutionalized 
racism. 

The Y AF obviou Iy cannot 
comprehend what racism feels 
like. It is not about some 
individual, temporary legislation. 
It i about centuries of di crimi-
natory, legalized oppression 
which is still reinforced in our 
society from the second a child 
enters school. 

Is the presence of women and 
people of color so large that you 
have to worry about your race 
not getting their slice of the 
American pie? 

Take a look at the big pic tu re. 
A few white tudents may get 
deferred now and then to other 
colleges to allow others to have 
their chance in higher education, 
but how many people of color 
have the chance to even apply to 
universities? 

Certainly not enough to scare 
people into questioning their 
merit as de erving students of 
higher education. 

White students have always 
had - and continue to have -
the upper hand on better educa-
tion, beller living condit ions, and 
better opportunities. 

If the Y AF was really for a 
color-blind sy tern, regardles of 
the past, they would spend their 
energy not on flyers, but on 
activities which discourage 
police brutality towards minori-
ties, prevent sexual assault, and 
provide better living conditions 
for over 50 percent of thi s 
nation' s children. 

QUOTA: Innocent bystanders are punished 
while minorities receive special treatment 
Continued from page 4 
practices and attitudes of 
mainstream America. How can 
one climb the educational ladder 
when there isn ' t even a rung to 
start on? Poverty breeds poverty, 
and without help, nothing will 
change. 

This argument would be air-
tight if it were not for one fact. 
68.5 percent of all people below 
the poverty line are white, 
according to the 1986 U.S. 
Bureau of the Census. 

This is where the real racism 
lies. How can one group of 
people claim that the suffering 
members of their race are more 
deserving of help than the 
suffering members of another? 
Does it hurt more to be black aJ)d 
poor than to be white and poor? 

I had always found poverty to 
be tragic, no matter the color of a 
person's skin. 

This is what is meant by 
ethnocentrism. In effect, people 
say that they only care about the 
suffering of minorities, but not 
about whites and Asians (one of 
the few minorities that do not 
receive benefits from the racial 
spoils system). 

But what about the fact that 
minorities were always discrimi-
nated against (and in the case of 
blacks, enslaved for 400 years)? 

Here is an other interesting 
concept. Even though today 's 
recipients of racial spoils are 
only 20 or 30 years old, we need 
to help them as a form of societal 
justice. 

Because whites have op-
pressed blacks and other minori-
ties in the past, present day 
whites and Asians must pay the 
price. 

Aside from the fact that we 
have had affirmative action for 
25 years, what bearing do the 

- immoral actions of our deceased 
ancestors have on the lives of 
present-day Americans? 

I am sure that every ethnic 
group can find racial injustices in 
their past. 

Does this give them the right 
to knock on the doors of all who 
have harmed their forefathers 
and demand payment? 

Indeed, if one searches hard 
enough, I am sure injustices can 
be found in the pasts of all 
impoverished people, white or 
otherwise. 

What about the racism that is 
prevalent in America today? 
Here is another good, yet 
debatable, point. 

If America is seething with 
racism, as some people have 
preached, minorities will 
definitely have a much more 

LETIERS TO THE EDITOR 

difficult time succeeding. 
Unfortunately , another ethnocen-
tric approach has been taken to 
this problem. 

The innocent bystanders are 
paying the cost. In other words, 
white and Asian students are 
being denied admittance to 
programs they strongly desire, in 
hopes of remedying the effects of 
discrimination by other parties. 

This would appear to be not 
. only illogical, but unjust. Why 
are we punishing people whose 
only fault is. that they were born 
white or Asian? We must punish 
those who implement discrimina-
tory hiring practices and ad-
vancement policies. 

Until this is done we will 
never abolish racism, but instead 
continue to drive a wedge funher 
into America's race relations. 

Far too many people in 
America live in poverty. The 
solution is not to target certain 
races and help them while 
disregarding others. 

We must penalize those who 
discriminate, as well as equally 
assist all the poor of our nation, 
regardless of the color of their 
skin. 

To do otherwise would be 
ethnocentric, racist. and lastly, 
would "Deny the equal protec-
tion of the laws."

ber of dastardly and hideous deeds. 
While David French and Daniel 
Bondurant were kind enough to 
sign theirnames,lhey did not men-

French was in charge of the TO

are. 

Tweedles Dum and Dee made 
reference to my letting "five high 
school girls" into the event. In do-

plete ignorance of the situation. 
All five of the non-students were 
guests of the band. none of them 
were in high school, and twO of 
them were males. Furthermore, 
their entry was authorized by the 
administration in advance. 

In addition, their letter implies 

that I am indeed responsible for all 
the events on this campus, which is 
not true. I am responsible for 
TGIFs, the A.S. Film Series, Pub 
Showcases (for local bands), the 
Reggae Festival, the New Music

Everyone know that in o rder 
to get a high-performance 
bicyde, a person has to go o ut 
and spend $2,000 o n an u1 tra-
lightweight aluminum or 
carbon-fiber frame and another 
S1000 on alloy and composite 
components . 

wouldn' t it cern strange 
ro take a race -ready bicycle and 
add 35 pound of weight to 
make it go FASTER: 

U D engineering major 
Anton Bo uton, Marc Vclerzo , 
and Geoff Willis did just that to 

mpete in the American ociery 
of Me hanical Engineer ' annual 
H uman Powered chicle (H PV) 

ompetition, held at the end of 
April at al Stare Long Beach . 

Bouton, Vcletzo , and Willis 
took a smndard bicy Ie and built 
a 30 per ent lamin ar ai rfoil 
arolU1d it ut of houschold 
items, induding fibe rglass, foam, 
and aluminum tubing. 

Despite doubling the weight 
of the bike, the team was 
counting o n the fact tllat 80 
percent of a cyclist ' energy goes 
into fighting wind resi ranee . 

-

T hey knew they could go fuster 
by using the airfoil to slice 
thro ugh the wind - and they 
were right. 

Even with the extra weight, 
Mack HlU1tress ofVCSD's 
cycling team was able to peddle 
the HPV to a peed of 35.79 
miles per ho ur, si:( mph faster 
than his best speed on a 
c nve nrional road bike. 

His e!fon was enough to win 
ni n th place in a field of national 
competitors in tlle maximum 
speed portion of the competition. 

Additi nally, U D' entry 
captured founh place in the 50-
mile road race competition. 

This may not cern too 
impre ive until one considers the 
fuct tllat it was independently 
built in someone's garage near 
UT . In contra t , schools like 
Berkeley and VCLA received 
backing from national aerospace 
and energy corporations. 

So for those people who have

thing : it works.

LETIERS TO THE EDITOR 

Quota Flyers Failed to Improve 
Quality of Debate on Issue 
Editor: 

I am writing in response to your 
article entitled "Some Allege Ay-
ers in Quotas are ~acist" (Guard· 
ion, May 13). I find it interesting 
that Mr. Brian Slack feel s that sim-
ply because people oppose his 
viewpoint, they are automatically 
racist. 

His contention that those "who 
oppose affirmative action are rac-
ist becau e they are looking at the 
issue from a one-sided, white male 
perspective" is very one-s ided and 
narrow-minded itself. 

One does not have to be white 
or male to be opposed to quotas or 
affirmative action. Perhaps Mr. 
Gary Geiler has other ideas that he 
feels would bener serve the needs 
of all students . 

Regardless of either the Young 
Americans for Freedom (Y AF) or 
the Geiler opinion of quotas and 
affirmative action, it is true that 
many students feel there are bener 
ways to create a diverse student 
body and to bener target those 
groups which are truly underrepre-
sented. 

Some different programs might 
include college preparation for, and 
recruitment of, lower-income and 
underrepresented groups well be-
fore college. It does not follow that 
one is racist if one understands the 
problems that accompany affinna-
tive action policies. 

Mr. Slack also overlooks the 
basic argument presented by the 
flyer when he focuses on details 
like "hacky-sack players" in Pa-
cific Beach. I don't believe that to 
have been the point of the flyers. 

Mr. Slack seems to think that he 
and his organizations have a greater 
right to free speech than do his 
fellow students. 

His own organizations post fly-
ers and promote ideas opposing 
things that many students believe, 
and yet I do not see him showing 
both sides to these arguments. 

Perhaps if Slack looks at the 
point of the "QuotaS" flyers -
whjch is that not only white stu-
dents , but students of other 
ethnicities as well, are harmed by 
quota systems while they p?ssibly 
do not really even help those stu-
dents at whom they are aimed -
he might not be so quick to rip the 
flyers down the next time. 

It is important to realize, I be-
lieve, that even though people may 
go about things in different ways 
(with quotas or not) they may have 
the same goals in common in the 

TWEEDLE

do it quicker and cheaper, I let 
them. I'm not here to cater to my 
ego as "booking-artist e1ltraordi-
naire" - I'm here to get events 
done. 

Their other allegations are un-
founded. Former Pop Events Chair 
Larry Weintraub neither did the 
blue fonns, Dor did he make sure 
the contracts got done on time. 
That credit should go to my advi-
sor, Randy Woodard. 

In addition, they stated. "[my] 
entire programming committee 
quit." 

This is not true. Out of ten, fi ve

Quota Bashers 
Are Standing Up 
For What's Right 
Editor: 

Racism : Affording one group 
of people an advantage or di ad-
vantage solely on the basis of their 
ethnicity. That 's what I've always 
thought racism was. 

With regard to the uppo edJy 
raci st flyer put out by Young 
Americans for Freedom, Brian 
Slack said that it is racist because it 
was written by biased people. 

By either definition, everything 
Slack and the Student Affinnative 
Action Committee (SAAC) have 
ever done is racist; they're cer-
tainly biased towards underrepre-
sented groups, and their whole 
purpose for existing is to give ad-
vantages to these groups, based on 
their skin color. 

The flyer may not have been in 
good taste, and I've never seen a 
"student of color" (is that the po-
litically correct expression now?) 
" hacky-sacking" around Pacific 

tude that if you ' re white, any opin-
ion you have on affinnative action 
or other race-related issues is auto-
matically invalid because you ' re 
biased. 

Slack apparently believes that 
whites are too stupid and biased to 
examine the issue logically, but 
that he is unbiased and therefore 
qualified to say the things he does. 

It 's interesting to note that in 
the same issue, Jonathan Traynham 
has a political "canoon" ridiculing 
a stereotyped white who got into 
college because his father is rich 
and wants to work for his daddy 's 
law firm . 

Remember all the fu ss over the 
stereotyped Mexican? And a ste-
reotyped Slack would probably 
cause twice the clamor. 

But Traynham's cartoon is fine, 
becau e it 's not racism when tho e 
being stereotyped are white. 

I look forward to the day when 
everyone is willing to be judged on 
his or her own merits. 

Every mom~nt that affirmative 
action exists takes us further from 
that day. Cheers to the Young 
Americans for Freedom for stand-
ing up for what is right.

to give me credit for the time spend 
on publicity, instead of lening 
Fonner Public Relations Commis-

I'd sooner trust a monkey to de-
liver a truckload of bananas than 
let Maurer do a job for me. 

Maurer has proven, without a 
doubt, that be's truly incompetent, 
and a turd. Okay, okay, I take the 
"turd" back. But I've had members 
from the A.S. and other student 
organizations ask that I, instead of 

Maurer, do their flyers for them. In 
the time it took Maurer to do one 
flyer, I could pump out four or five. 
Thankfully, theA.S. has appointed 
a competent individual this year. 

Now, you might ask: Ifit'ssuch 
a bitch doing this job, why have I 
stuck with it? 

Aside from the fact that few 
other people would do it (nobody 
else ran against me in the last elec-
tion), even with the office and the 
scant amenities, when I commit 
myself to something, I stick it 
through. I work hard and do the 
best job that I can do.

In a quote in the article ·Some Allege Flyers on Quotas Are Racist" 

(Guardian, May 13), the chair of Young Americans for Freedom was 
referred to as Greg Geiler. His correct name is Gary Geiler. 

In addition, the figure of $34 in the article · Parking Permits Could 
Jump $34 Next Year" (Guardian, May 13), was incorrect. The actual 
figure is $36. The paragraph in which the $34 figure was also reported 
should have read as follows : ·Under the across-the·board proposal, 
'S : 'S ,' and 'A' permits will increase by $36 for the year. For example , 
'So permits will cost $234, and 'A' permits will be $315. In comparison,

ing with tudent organiza: ions," A 
repre entative from the Women's 
Re ouree Center explained how 
helpful McKay has been in aiding 
that organization. 

Eykamp cited experience on the 
UCB as his greatest asset. Having 
"worked on mo t of the current poli-

the board grow," he felt he pos-
se sed the tools to "make sure the

Despite the low attendance, 

Pasternak e timated that approxi-

to ign the letters protesting the edu-
cation budget cuts. 

Gold said that students at UC

"I highly recommend that the dance on May

friend and l know where to place bomb - and 
everything is all set. If you don'l cance l iI, 
everyone will die ," 

Officer Mike Ki zz.ee came 10 the Lesbian-
Gay Bisexual Association (LGBA) office Ihree 
times last week. Each time, he made a repon on 
threaten ing, anonymous calls, ome of which 
are quoted above, apparently provoked by the 
organization's advenisement for their semi-
fonnal dance, "The Prom You ever Had." 
held last Saturday. The voice - "r'm going to 
bomb it" - calmly whispered the threat, 
explaining how and when it was to be carried 
out, and what hi demand were; it wa the first 
of its kind that any LGBA dance or student 
organization ocial event had ever received. 

According to Sergeant Randy Fedak , those 
infrequent bomb threats that are reponed to Ihe 
campu police have been limited to political 
issues or events such as last quaner's lecture by 
Edward Said, an alleged spokesperson for the 
PLO. 

"II was my decision," said Fedak, "to err on 
the s ide of caution. " Fedak ' move to increase 
security at the dance was in res pOll e to the 
provocative flyers, homophobic phone mes-
ages, and the New Music Festival that has a 

reputation for attracting Skinheads. ''They 
don't have the be ' t tra k record," he -ald. 

By 7 p.m., the prom 's decorating committee 
had fini shed blowing up the green, black and 
ilver balloon. The occasional popping gave 

the decorators something to joke and laugh 
about. 

"Of course the joke o'f the evening was that 
we were all going to have a blast, or that this 
really was going to be the prom we'll never 
have," LGBA co-chair Tony Valenzuela 
recalled . 

When they had fini hed decorating, a team 
of police dogs, specially irained for the 
detection of planted explosives, were brought 
in from the off-campus San Diego Police 
Department to sniff out any dangers, The 
ballroom was then seale,d and secured until the 
dance began at 9 p.m. 

"I was nervous getting out of my car and 
walking to the ballroom," said Matt Petrich, 21 , 
an anthropology rnajor at the University of San 
Diego. "Having heard about the bomb tbieat, at 
firstl blew it off as a joke and then [ really 
thougbt about it. I said to myself, ' [ reaUy don't 
want to die on my way to the dance ... ' 

"Generally, I found the armosphere really 
friendly," said Monique (last name withheld by 
request), 20, a Revelle college student. "I didn't 
feel any pressure in going to the dance. Of 
course I felt safe because I wasn't aware of the 
bomb threat. I actually liked having [police] 
officers there. 1 talked to two of them and they 
seemed really nice. They said, ' You have the 
right to think what you want to think and you 
deserve to come here, We just want to make 
this a safe aunosphere, .. '

seemed much more uptight, trying to act very

"I don't like bars. They can be very preten-

THE ART OF 
FURNITURE 
By Joel Poukkula 
Guardian Reporter 

Ever think of that comfortable lazy boy chair or that 
handcrafted coffee table as an "art" object? Most of us 
would hardly compare an old sofa to a Matisse or a 
Brancusi. Usually the furniture that occupies the world 
around us,is simply a generic space filler, at the very least 
functional, and at the most a valued antique. In fact, apart 
from that all-toa-familiar search for that one chair that 
will match those drapes, or that unpleasant event when 
one realizes that the furniture is missing, we' rarely think 
much about furniture. 

However, in the world of art, there are artists that 
design and make furniture in order to explore the nature 
of furniture. The Grove Gallery at the University of San 
Diego is showing fifteen well-known and emerging fur-
niture designers from across the nation whose work 
~'''~~'''6'-~ the traditional way in which most of us view 
furniture . These artists work conceptually using

TAIKO 
ContInUed from H1 

"What we've done is ex-
panded taiko into a dimension 
of using our own experiences," 
explained PJ. Hirabayashi , who 
co-founded and co-directed the 
group with her husband Roy. 
"We're primarily second, third, or 
fourth-generation A ian-Ameri-
can, so our interpretations of the 
tradition is definitely inspired,col-
ored by, our growing up with a lot 
of other ethnicitie and cultures 
around us. 

"The audience will feel a 
swing," P.J. declared. "That' s one 
of the more prominent aspects of 
our style. A lot of folks come up to 
us and say, ' Wow, you guys look 
like you're having a good timel ' 
There 's a lot of joy involved, un-
like maybe the stoic J apane e arts 
which are more serious." 

Taiko has its roots in religious 
ceremonies - priests used drum 
to dispel evil spirits, as well as 
insects, from the rice fields. The 
San Jose Taiko troupe likewise 
had its start in religion - Ron and 
the youth advisor of his local Bud-
dhist church decided to form a 
taiko group in the early '70s as a 
way to altract more young people 
into the church 's activities. 

Eventually, the group expanded 
its services to the Asian-American 
community at large when adults 
showed an interest in the activity. 
San Jose Taiko now also conducts 
workshops on taiko history, rudi-
ments, and playing. The group also 
sponsors ajuniortaiko group, pub-
lishes a quarterly newsletter, and 

presents weekend seminars toother 
groups in Canada, Japan, and the 
U.S. 

The group recruits new mem-
bers from their public workshops. 
Potential members then participate 
ina 12-weektrainingclass-"It 's 
like an audition period" - before 
they can join the company. 

"Often it'll be two years before 
they're really capable of perform-
ing," Roy said. 

The group grew as an extension 
of the Asian-American movement 
of the late '60s and early '70s. It 
was "the resurgence of the search 
for an ethnic identity," Roy ex-
plained. 

"We were really involved in the 
Asian-American community and 
ethnic studies in college, and the 
issues that those activities bring 
up," Roy said. "For me, it was real 
important to under .tand my own 
identity as an Asian-American. 

"I saw taiko as a great opportu-
nity to try to incorporate mu ic and 
identity into more of an Asian-
American activity," he aid. " It 
was a way of using a traditional 
Japanese instrument, the drums, 
which are really universal and 
making it mean something to us 
here, today. San Jo e Taiko isn't 
Japanese-Japanese, it 's Japanese-
American." 

In addition to adapting tradi-
tionalJapanese music, the San Jo e 
Taiko group has adopted the 
wholistic and collective values of 
the cu lture. Before each three-hour 
rehearsal, all the members of the 
group are required to exercise -
both individually and as a group 
- in orderto maintain theirendur-

ance for the high-energy perfor-
mances. 

The members of the group are 
also responsible for its creative 
output. All members participate in 
composing, choreographing. de-
Signing and producing costumes. 
and handcrafting the drums. Lead-
ership of the group is rotated in an 
artis ti c committee so that each 
member ha an opportunity to have 
a say. 

San Jose Taiko 's outreach to 
the community and "inreach" to it 
members ' crea ti ve and ethn ic 
voices, are embodied in the perfor-
mance. As an Asian-American art 
form, the San Jose Taiko perfor-
mance is something that anyone. 
not just Asian-Americans, can re-
late to and enjoy. 

" I would say that a lot of the 
comment we get from people is 
that there' some type of univer-
sality within our mu ic that you 
can relate to across the board, be-
cau e it's non-descript of origin," 
P.J. said. "You know that there 's 
something Asian about it, but it 's 
not entirely Asian. [(' s cross-cul-
tural in focus ." 

Roy summed up the group' 
goals: "Our main message i on 
two levels: one is we're really in-
terested in introducing the general 
public to what taiko is about. How 
we ' re using that instrument . as 
Asian-Americans changing a tra-
ditional Japane e art, is the second 
part of the me sage. The impor-
tance of what we' re trying to do is 
found in the two-fold point of what 
the taiko is about, and how we're 
using it to create what we call the 
Asian-American musical art form."

Jambay to Host Show 
At the Price Center . 
By Patricia Jellie 
Senior Staff Writer 

• 

Jambay, that "politiCally cor-
rect"rock band,have just released 
their self-entitled debut compact 
disc on Run If You Can Records. 
To celebrate, the quartet will once 
again entertain UCSD with its 
gritty sound th is Saturday nightat 
the Price Center. 

The only reason not to have 
heard of this local group is either 
if you live under a rock or you 
transfered schools. Yet Jambay 
continues to emphasize the 00-
tion that they are not a col1ege 
band. "[But] we are a San Diego 
band," guitarist/singer Chris 
Haugen recently explained. "We 
are specifically focusing on the 
college crowd or scene." Although 
most of their gigs are performed 
in a pub atmosphere, the musi-
cians are eagerly anticipating this 
chance to cater to an all-ages 

crowd. "We really want to be 
able to showcase the mu ic with-
out the restrictions that come from 
a barenvironment," Haugen said. 
"There are lots of extraneous 
things happening. People come 
to see you, but they are also there 
for the bar and to play pool. So a 
lot of our softer and acoustic stuff 
goes right out the window." 

Instead of the typical hour-
long playlist fonnat, be prepared 
fora three to fourhourshow. The 
group plans to integrate their 
music with a special multi-media 
production involving special 
lighting effects, film projection, 
and an extensive stage set. 

With the right breaks, Jambay 
has the potential of making it big. 
Really big. Check them out while 
they still " want to make contact 
with the people and establish a 
real personal relationship with 
the audience."

BLACKSMITH 
Continued from H2 
song 'So Goe AnOlher Day,'" said Hoffee. 

"We're ju t lucky because ii's not planned al all," 
said Graham. "It's not contrived in any way. It jusl 
happens to be the way il sounds, so if we're on the 
vergeof omething big, that's greal. We really lucked 
out. It worked perfectly." 

The band , Iyricalslylei uniqueaswell.lnsteadof 
following the lypicaJ ver e-choru -verse truclure, the 
song lyric have no true division . There are no lyrical 
"hooks. II The songs exist more as a cohesive whole, 
and the lyrics, in effect, convey an entire story. They 
resemble prose more than poetry. Graham remarked, 
"]t just happens that way. There's never really a 
formula. We're telling a SIOry, and we want ilia sound 
a certain way. II's not intentional with Paul; he'skinda 
unschooled in that he never had omeone say to him, 
' Here 's how to write a ong.' I hope we never wrile a 
song where Ihe lille has 10 be repealed in tbe chorus. II 

When asked if the band's experience of playing 
Ii ve have changed their perspective of the music, Roth 
replied, "[There i J a lot harder edge to it. It's a lot 
more powerful. It lill ha the ame elemenls as Ihe 
album, but it's not so toned down," 

"Yeah," agreed Graham. "There is a 101 more edge 
to il live. [People] have gOI 10 ee u play live. The 
album's real sofl and mellowed out - our producer 
had a lot to do with that. Which is o.k ... I'm glad it's 
beller live than the other way around. If we went back 
inlO the studio now, the album would come out a 101 
differenl. Live, we do exactly what we do on the 
album. Paul sings alone, and we play. We all do what 
each one of us does best." 

"Yeah, butChri plays guitar anyway," joked Roth. 
Everyone at the table again broke out laughing, in-
c I udi ng Hoffee, who swore he'll {akecare of Roth "the 
ame way I look care of our last bass player." 

"Of course I gel the most crap in the band, being the 
youngesl and the newest," Roth mused. "I don'l know 
how it happens, Ijust sit here ... " This broughl a chorus 
of "Yeah, righl" from the other members. He contin-
ued, " I like it when they tell the story of how we met. 
It's the only time 1 can get a compliment." 

ThW'sday, May 16, 1991 

So Graham began the story: "Tony was playing in 
orne helpless band called, gellhis, 'Tragic Rabbit' . 

They did all covers, bUlthey were 0 butchered thai 
they sounded like bad originals. We came in one 
night [10 a club] to see a friend playing guilar,and we 
looked at each other and said, 'That uck, but the 
bass player rips .' So we walked in and to our aston-
ishment, it was him. After they were done we had 10 
tell him how grealthey were and we took him OUI to 
the van and showed him our new album. He said. 
'Who plays bass for you,' and we said, ' We don't 
havea bass player. ' So he jumped in the front seat and 
said, ' Youdonow!' Meanwhile his old band stood on 
the street goin', 'Uh-oh!' We played him Ihe song 
'Calch 22' and we said 'What do you think?' and he 
said, 'Let' go play it.' So we went out to Ihe garage 
and he gOI it preny darnn close. The guy's a genius. 
Luckiest day of his life," 

ROlh comments, '" was never into any of Ihe 
bands I've played in. It was just to keep my chop up. 
1 didn'l really like playing that music. But if I had 
never been in that other band, 1 never would have 
hooked up with the e guys. Thi i the only band I've 
ever been in that I've really liked." 

"The songwriting with Tony involved now gives 
us another per on for Paul to bounce ideas off," 
Graham said. ''The new songs we 've wrillen are a lot 
stronger than the olher songs. They ' re really good 
ongs." 

Roth aid, " [t all comes together, too. It's a real 
good looking and sounding band. Thi band' great, 
and we'veall played in a latta bands. It's by far better 
than any band I've heard locally." 

The final question 1 ask concerns the band's future 
ambition. Where do they want to go with Blacksmith 
Union? Graham concluded, "We don't sellimits by 
saying, 'We don't want to be really successful be-
cause that would be selling out. ' We wanl to have 
enough money 10 do whal we wanl to do, like making 
another album. Already I feel successful. A latta 
places we go, people already recognize us. That's 
unbelievable. II 's mindblowing." 

Blacksmith Union will be playing an acouslic set 
on Thursday, May 16 at 3 p.m. at Monty's Den, 
localed on the SDSU campus.

GROVE 
Continued from H1 
producing furniture that explores 
both asthetic and ocial values. 

The artist Hermon Futrell of 
Aurora, CO, is exhibiling two 
chairs that create a visual conflici 
between the modem and the an-
cient. 

His "Chair" and "Blue Chair" 
are made of raw wood and tree 
limbs, which are painted in a style 
that is similar to indigenous cul-
ture. 

What is panicularly strong vi-
sually about the e chairs is Ihe 
echoing of a modem object, achair, 
in its construction of unlamed ma-
terials. These objects have a life of 
their own (hat make them more 
than functional. They have a per-
sonality Ihat i rarely seen in tradi-
tional furniture. 

The "Smart Chairs" made by 
Ron Smith of Falmouth, MA, cre-
ate a tension bel ween the simple 
chair form and ilS use of complex 
mathematical equations as decora-
tion. 

These chairs appear 10 be made 
for children, yet there is a play 
between the complex equations and 
the innocence of Ihe simple form. 
There seems to be a dialogue be-
tween the two worlds, child and 
adull, that clouds the asthetic is-
sues of the piece. While the equa-
tions themselve are quite nice vi -
sually , the play between form and 
content creates an inleresting sense 
of anxiety. 

A quite beautiful piece by Tom 
Loeser of Madison, WI, litled 
"Dovelail Box" also queslions the 
aSlhelic tradition in its use of un-
conventional materials. This ob-
ject, as the name suggests, is a 
small chest which i made oul of 
such unlikely materials as card-
board and paper. However, this is 
no ordinary cardboard box, bUI an 
eleganlly handcrafted chest Ihat 
has been treated so as to maximize 
the surface qualities of the card-
board. 

What is strange about this ob-
ject is that illooks quite expensive 
even though it is made out of a 
material thai is normally thrown 
away. 

The "WolfCabinel" by Charles 
Mark-Walker of Los Angeles has 
a powerful presence because of ils 
uniqueness. It has a strange aura 
that draws the viewer to it. A sense 
of mystery is fell by the viewer, in 
part because of the vibrant colors 
and the unusualness of the wolf 
caught in mid-motion on top oflhe 
cabinet 

The contrast between the rela-
tively neutral cabinet and the static 
wolf create curiosily. There is a 
temptation to search inside, as 
though there were more beasts 
waiting. 

There is a high variety of style 
and individuality in these artists' 
works. As al\ the artists in Ihis 
show deal wilh and seek to rede-
fine furnilure, their work shows a 
glimpse into the leading trends and 
concerns in American furniture de-
sign. 

After seeing these works, it is 
doubtful that anyone would view 
their own furniture in quite the 
same way.

Dreams So Real 
G/oryllne 
Arlsta 

Two albums later, Dreanl So 
Real has relurned with Gloryline, a 
hit and miss recording full of prom-
i ingsongs that really get the blood 
pumping - only 10 senle inlo rep-
elitious drivel. .' 

The problem wim Gloryline is 
nol a lack of talent. Singer/ 
songwriter/guilarist Bob Marler 
fuses his Byrds-like acou lical 
guitar picking with hisdrivingelec-
tric guitar rhythms in a balanced 
and la teful way. His "guitar 
wanks" (he doesn' t call them so-

The UCSD Guardian 

10 ) are simple, bUI they are fre-
quently wel\-timed and effective. 
His voice i throaty , passionate, 
anddistinctive, while Trenl Allen ' 
melodic bass lines and Drew 
Worsham's ta ty drum-rolls are 
also noteworthy. 

The ong on thi album, how-
ever, frequently dissappoint. 
"Stand Tall" begins with a choppy 
guitar inlro and a eries of electri -
fying drumlicks that really get the 
song moving. But the guitar then 
turns inlo simp le three-chord 
lrumming and the enticing inlro i 

never heard from again. The vo-
cals also begin on a rousing note, 
but never build in intesity and lose 
their momenlUm. The highlight, 
"Overton Park," is an intriguing 
lap sleel-guitar piece that blends 
into the hauntingly beautiful tone 
of a hammond organ. Unfortu-
nately, it i only the opening to 
another song, " Faith," which stag-
nates and is ultimately unfulfilling 
and boring. The res t of the ongs 
also fail to sustain and build upon 
their initial energy and tum into 

repilitiou , background music. The 
band' performanceofBadfinger' 
early '70s tune "Day after Day" i 
particularly lackluster and does 
nothing new or inleresling with the 
song. 

Dreams So Real has potential. 
Although they don ' t get it right on 
this album, their music demon-
strates both talent and soul. [fthey 
learned how to use Ihe two, they 
might be worth the listen.

tunes. 

Each WIck is backed with deep,

track is " Love Hurts." Boy

Boy George doesn' t rely on safe

J UST A FEW NOTES: • It's a head case theme. Yes, Rickey Hender on 
can play, and yes, his attitude 
should not overshadow the fact 
that he is one of the mo t 
dominant players to play the 
game in the last 30 years. But 
that still doesn't give him the 
right to act like the spoiled brat 
from hell. 

• Slill , Hender on i not the 
biggest balloon head in baseball. 
That honor falls to Star Search 
winners (most talent, least gray 
matter) Albert (don't call me 
Joey) Belle and Rob Dibble. 
Belle is a relative newcomer with 
a rather lurid past (he wrote the 
travel guide for rehab centers), 
while Rob Dibble could be the 
game's first Six Million Dollar 
Man - bionic arm and a metal 
head. 

C ONTINUING THE head case theme, Jose and Madonna. 
Madonna and Jose. Bash Brother 
meets the Material Girl. Canseco 
says that he spent the early hours 
of the morning just talking with 
the original virgin . Jose . .. pal, 
buddy, boy lOY, Mr. Clutch -
not . . . nobody talks to Madonna. 

• I'm sorry. I wa wrong. I 
just said that the biggest head 
cases in baseball were Albert 
Belle and Rob Dibble. And while 
they may in fact have, literally, 
the largest noggins in the game, 
the fact of the matter is that, in 
the true meaning of the cliche, 
nobody portrays a horse 's 
backside better than Mike 
Marshall. Let's take a look at 
Mike's distinguished career, one 
which has had him wann some 
of the most famous benches in 
America, from Chavez Ravine to 
Central Park: 

Mike hits some home runs. 
Mike has hot fling with Belinda

• Men's tennis falters

Afler a promising

Sunday, the UCSD 
men 's te nnis team 

ran intoa brick wall throughout the 
remai nder of the NCAA Division

losing two of its last three matches 
on the way to placing sixth overall . 

The Tritons were quickly dis -
patc hed into the co n olation 
bracket by number-two seed -
and eventual tournament runner-
up - UC Santa Cruz, who drilled 
UCSD 8-1 Monday afte rnoon. 

From there, the Trilons netted a 6-
3 victory over Was hington & Lee 
(VA) Tuesday, only to 10 e a ti ght

For the UCSD women 's 
crew team, the Pacific

are more a race against the past than a 
race against Long Beach State, Cal, or 
any other school. 

"[This year's is) about an average 
crew," Head Coach Jack Vallerga said. 
"I don ' t think they're going to prove to 
be as strong or successful as [crews in) 
years past." 

But, according to Vallerga, compe-
tition has dictated that this is a fast 
year, and he believes that some crews 
are having exceptional years. "I don't

Continued from page 11 
the favorite to win their third na-
tionaltitle in ix years. 

According to UCSD Head 
Coach Denny Harper, much of the 
credit must go to the team's newest 
members. 

"The player thatretumedfrom 
last year's team are playing real 
well. But the reason we've been 
able to become a team capable of 
winning i due to the development 
of our younger player and our 
goalie," he said. 

Harperhasbeenmo timpressed 
with the development of three play-
ers who are now playing key role 
in the Triton . bid to repeat: Erin 
Bakey, Melinda Hanley, and 
Alii on We tfall . Before the ea-
son began, neither Backey nor 
Hanley had played a minute of 
organized water polo. Both have 
developed quickly and have pro-
vided the Tritons with the talent 
and depth that - early in the ea-
son - it eemed they would be 
lacking. 

Goalie Dawn R inghand has 
been another pleasant surprise for 
the Tritons thi s year. She has pro-
vided a teadying influence in the 
nets as two-time Ail-American Jefi 
Paulsen' repla emem. 

Even with the development of 
the Triton' newe t players, the 
team would not be in its current 
position withoUlthe standout play 
of it four retuming lars: Jamie 
Daley, Chri ty Parker, Kristen 
Larsen, and Brenda ReilOn. 

All four have earned berth on 
the United States' National "A" 
team, and - in pacing the Tritons 
this year - have shown why. 

"They are all excellent players 
who we look to to get things done," 
Harper aid. "They're strong de-
fen ive player , and threats at the 
offen ive end." 

Despite the return offour of the 
stars from last year's team, Harper 
feel thatthis year's team was very 
different from the one that won the 
national championship a year ago. 

"Last year's team was last year 's 
team ," he aid. " It was unique to 
that year. We had three players 
graduate since then , so th is year's 
team is completely different. The 
only comparison I'd be willing to 
make i that this team has as good 
a chance 10 win as last year's did." 

The Tritons will enter this week-
end as the second seed in a tourna-
ment so close that over half of the 
eight teams entered have a legiti -
mate hot at the title. 

UC Davis, the top seed, bas yet 
to lose a game to a collegiate team. 
The Aggies defeated UCSD twice 
this season. A week ago, they de-

want to take anything away from 
the integrity of the crew," he said. 
"[Butl, the varsity is a small young 
boat." 

UCSD has entered four boats in 
the regatta: varsity eight, novice 
eight, varsity four, and novice four. 

Prior to the race, the UCSD 
varsity boat is ranked 12th out of 
16 boat . Vallerga said that he an-
ticipates that the Tritons will make 
it into the peti te or second final for 
seventh to 12th place. 

" [f we come in seventh to 10th 
place it ' ll be pretty good finish," 
he said. 

The novice eight boat is cur-
rently ranked lith of 19. "The top 
six is pretty tacked,"Vallergasaid.

WOMEN'S WATER POLO AT THE NATIONALS 
• The UCSD women 's 
water polo team begins 
defense of its national 
championship this 
weekend as the host for 
the USA Water Polo 
National Championships.

UC Davis, whom the 
Tritons beat 9-3 in last 
year's title game. UCSD 
is seeded second.

TITLE GAME 

UCSD d, UC DAVIS 

9-3 

feated the Tritons 6-2 in the West-
ern Qualifying Tou{Jlament frnals, 
but it was a game that left Harper 
optimistic. 

"We fell behind early in that 
game," he said. "But we battled 
back. We had our opportunities to 
score in the fourth period, but it 
seemed like we ran out of gas. " 

UC Santa Barbara is the 
tournament's third seed. The Gau-
chos split !heir two meetings with 
the Tritons this season. In their last 
meeting, the.Tritons beat UCSB 8-
6 in the Western Qualifying Tour-
nament semifinals. 

Fourth-seeded Slippery Rock 

"[ don't know if we can crack into 
that." 

"If we beat [uq Santa Bar-
bara, we'lJ be in the [grandl finals. 
If we don't beat SantaBarbara, we 
won 't be in the finals," he said. 

But the novice and varsity races 
are completely different stories. 
Mysteries to be exact. 

"r have no idea in either of the 
fours," Vallergasaid. "We haven 't 
raced them before. Both have a 
chance to get into the final si~." 

For both fourboats,thePCRC's 
are the opening and c losing race of 
the season. 

But for the eight crews, the re-
gatta is a final assessment of the 
past year's work. "At the end of the 
season we have one last measure-
ment to see how good we are," 
Vallerga said. 

State, and fifth-seeded Cal Poly 
San Luis Obispo are also expected 
to contend for the title. 

Harper feels thatlhis year's tour-
nament could be as open as ever 
because of the parity among the 
top teams. 

"Whoever wins this thing de-
pendson who 's hotthis weekend," 
he said. 

"If you were to play it again 
next weekend , you would prob-
ably get completely different re-
sults. The tournament is so close 
that the fact that we're hosting 
could be the thing that pushes us 
over the top." 

Although the Tritons may not 
be able to catch some of the un-
touchables, team improvement is a 
goal, Vallerga said. "Both [eightl 
crews are going faster," he said. 
"Now we have to see how much 
faster is faster." 

UCSD has focused its training 
on speeding up between the 250 
and 750 meter marks, an area of 
the course in which the Tritons 
have slowed earlier this season. 

" We're going to go faster. 
Whether it's fast enough to move 
up in the rankings [is unknownl," 
ValJerga said. 

Vallerga seemed a linle less than 
optimistic heading into the week-
end, but he acknowledged that only 
time will tell how good this year's 
crew really is: "They're as ready as 
they're going to be thi year."

at the PCRC' , the winners will 
collect five shirts each, one from a 
member of each of the other final-
i t . "One thing an oarsman can 
mea ure his succe s from is by the 
number of shirt he' won," Shan-
non said. 

Chance are, the Tritons will 
come home with a few more hirts 
than when they left. UCSD is en-
tering three boats in what is con-
sidered the We t Coast Champion-
ships- varsity eight, varsity four, 
and novice eight. UCSD will race 
for the Craig Perez Cup, which is 
awarded to the top Western 
Intercollegiate Rowing A ocia-
tion school. 

"I feel pre tty good about the 
vat ity [eightl," Shannon said. 
"We'll try to get into the grand 
final." To do 0, UCSD - seeded 
seventh in the West - will have a 
tough time in its heat wi th the likes 
of top-seeded Wa hington State

ing Triton 10hn Cros and Vem 
Yarnell 6-3, 6-3. The only UCSD 
double win on the day wa turned 
in by Brian Beattie and Chad 
Morse. who won in tmight et 
over Wa hington' Andy Bohul-
insky and Carlos uno 6·4, 7-5. 

In ingle. the Triton -' three 
wins came at Ihe numbertwo. three 
and six pot. umber two Belloli 
upended Melreuli 6-2, 6·3 while 
Cros put away Diaz 6-4, 7-5. 
Yarnell defeated Nuno in quick 
fashion 6-3,6-4. 

rn their Ihree inglcs defeats, 
the Triton did not go down so 
easily, taking all three opponents 
the full three- et distance . Chri 
Emery fell 4-6, 6·3, 6·3 to Emilio 
Bogado at number five, while 
Beanie wa bested by Hurd 7-6, 4-
6,6·1. 

rn number one ingles, Morse 
gave Flippin-Read - the number 
one seed in the national individual 
sing les draw - a good run for hi s 
money before losing 6-2, 5-7, 6-4. 

Tue day's matchup with Wash-
ington & Lee (V A) - not jusl 
Washinglon , Lee showed up too 
- went much better for UCSD a 
the Tritons prevailed 6-3. 

The Tritons pur away Washing-
ton & Lee in singles, winning five 
out of the six match ups, with all 
five wins coming in straight-set 
fashion_ 

Morse defeated Bill Meadows 
6·1, 7-6, while Belloli whacked 
Rob MacNaughton 6-4, 6-2. 

Beattie, Emery, and Yarnell 
cruised to victory in the four, fi ve

and ix pots with win over Reid 
Manley (6-3, 6-4), Robert Wei ll 
(7-5,6-3), and Travis We 1(6-2 ,6-
2), respectively. 

Doubles didn't go quite 0 well 
for the Tritons a they dropped two 
out of Ihree. 

UCSD'sonly win was turned in 
by Emery and Yarnell, who 
avoided a doubles sweep with a 7-
6,6-3 victory over Wein and Wesl 
at number three doubles_ 

Perhaps the least memorllble 
day of the tournament came on 
Monday for UCSD. as Ihe Tritons 
were blitzed 8-1 by second· eed 
UC Santa Cruz. 

The Banana Slugs dominated 
UCSD, weeping all six singles 
matches. 

The only Triton win wa turned 
in by Beanie and Morse at number 
two double ,as they defeated Greg 
1arasiti and Brett Roeder 6-3, 6-3.

(they signed Joe Price as insurance 
for goodne s 'ake), and they can't 
figure out if Bip Robert i a 
leflfielder, a centerfielder, a third 
baseman, or a second baseman. 
Word of advice: leave the guy alone 
and let him play. He's the clo e -t 
thing the National League has to 
Rickey Henderson. 

The most likely team to re over

• The Laker could be in serious 
trouble again t P nland_ The Trail 
Blazers have everythi ng the Golden

and more depth. Of course, Port-
land doesn't have Don Nelson. :lIld 
if y u ask the an ntonio Spur" 
that could make all the difference 

in the world . 
• If POt11and and the Lakers go 

to seven games, beating each other 
up along the way, Ihe do r could 
spring wide open for the hicago 
10 rdans to win their first B title.
