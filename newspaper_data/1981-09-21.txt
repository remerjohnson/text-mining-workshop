Another chance 
Th future of campus r adio has been threatened by 

event s of thi s s ummer . The UCS D s tation . KS OT, has 
come under hea \'\! fire from the Student Cent er Boa rd for 
their dec is ion to h ring KKK Grand Dragon T om Metzger 
on campu s las l July for a public affairs int ervi ew. Wh en 
the Student Cent er Board \'ot ed to lock the doors of KSDT 
whi le the int erview inc ident was review ed , KSDT 
volunt a ril y stopped broadca s ting for a 24 hour period . 

This Wednesda \' , the AS Council wi ll con s ider what 
s hould be done a b<>ut KSDT. Obstens ibl y. the bigges t bon e 
of cont enl ion t he AS has is t he fact t hat KSDT has s t ill 
found it imposs ible to obtain a low-power FCC 
t rans mi ss ion licen se. As pa rt of a budgetary contract ma de 
bet ween KSDT a nd the A las t September, KSDT agreed 
to beg in bropadcas t ing on campus by last Spring Qu art er. 
Yet it seems clear t hat Wednesday's di scuss ion wi ll cent e r 
on the Metzger interview . 

The ac ti ons o f the Student Cent er Boa rd represent 
not hing more t ha n pure cen sors hip and a viola t ion of the 
First Amendment . There is no need to discuss t he merit s of 
the dec is ion to int ervie\\' T om Met zger , 

T o be fa ir, the Met zger int erview did not run s moothl y . 
Metzger dominat ed the int erv iew loa point t h at did not 
refl ect favora bl y on the expressed edit ori al policy of the 
!ota ti on. Perhaps KSDT s hould have s hown mor e 
d isc ret ion in select ing an int en·iewer. Buf tha t is not the 
issue here. KSDT, as a mem ber of t he broadcast media. has 
a' right and respons ibi lity to presen t t he programming t ha t 
if:., managemenl feels sen 'Cs the communit\' best. 

T he official reason for the Stude nt Cen ter Board's 
deci~ion to s hut KSDT do\\'n \\'as t hat the pr esence of 
Metzger on ca mpus s ho\\'ed "a fl agran t disrega rd for 
student and facilit\ · ..,afet\'." No\\" whi le t his should be a 
legit imat e concern ;If all part ies imolved . includi ng KSDT , 
the Student Center Board cannot justify taking KSDT off 
the ai r for t hat reason . T he St udent Cent er Hoard has 
jurisdict ion ()\'er t he bui lding in \\' h ich K DT resides, not 
t he people or equ ipment inside. 

T he AS Cou nci I does havc IX)\\'cr oyer KSDT itself. A fler 
the Metl'ger incident. AS presiden t J u les Bagneris placed 
the KSDT budget on freeze. At Wednesday's meet ing. th 
AS wil l probably discu ss a number of alternat ives. 
including t he closing of KSDT. 

When di scu~~ing I he KS DT issue. it is im lxl rt a n t for t he 
member~ of the AS Council to keep a number o f IXlints in 
mind , First and foremost , the Metzger inten'iew is 
irrcle\'ant 10 a 11\' discussion of \\hat shou ld be done to 
K ' DT a t Ihi s poi·nl. Forthci\SCounci l torequir K 'OT to 
run onl y certain pro).,'Tamming in return for it s allocated 
budget \\ould gi\'e the AS prior t'estra in t and censorship 
power O\'er KSDT. 0 radio stat ion need operate in such a 
re~tricti\'e em ironment. The Fir~ 1 Amendme n t proh ibil~ 
it. 

Furthermore, the t\S "houle! not attack KSDT for tx'ing 
unable to broadca~t on ca111 l)ll :-". KSDT cannnt force the 
FCC to grant t he I ran'-omi"s ion li l'e n~e it requires, Th San

Two arrested in media center theft 
By PA L FARWELL 

Stu ff \\' ri tc ." 
Two UC D custodi,pns w re 

arre;,ted la s t we e k in 
connection with the theft of 
513,000 worth of equipment 
from the Third College Media 
Center. 

But quick action on the part 
of the Med ia Center s taff and 
the co ·operat ion of loca I 
television stat ions has helped 
UCSD police reeover most of 
the stolen vid 0 equipment. 

The theft, which occured 
Tuesday night last week, 
in volved several new color 
television video monitors, tape 
recorders. and tele\'ision 
cameras intended to upgrade 
th e cummunicatiun program's 
video capabilities . 

After discovering the theft, 
Dan Sullivan, director of Ihe 
Media Center, re]Xlrted it first 
to the Campus Police , and then 
to three local te le\' ISI0n 
statlon:-., which broadcast the 
n e w " that Wednesda v 
e\'ening. An un identified San 
Diego area citizen sa" I he 
evening ne\\,'~ and informed 
th e police thai two l CSD 
cu :-..todian ~. Charlie Thomp' 

son and Paul 'olomon , had 
alleg dly attempted to sell 
some of the stol en equipment 
to him. ( CSI) po lice are 
unwilling to release the name 
of the informant pending the 
fu)) investigation of the case). 

"We are very graleful to the 
new" media . bot h tele\ is ion 
and print (for th eir co-
operation)." said Sullivan . " In 
our case, we know I he pt'()ple 
in the newsroom!> .. . We ca lled 
up and hit very heavil y that 
(Thom pson a nd Solomon ) 
were playing dirt y pool. They 
were not only stea ling (from 
the university ), they were 
stealing from the st udent ~ 
who depend on t hi .., equipmenl 
for t heir work." 

C hronol og i ca ll y, the 
foll owing happened: Early 
Wednesday morning, (the 
morning after the theft). Jim 
Smith, a enior Tele\' ision 
Technician. walked int o the 
Engineering workshop of the 
Media Center and discovered a 
\'ideo monitor was missing. 

" \Ve took a quick look 
around t he building and 
dl ;,co\'ered that some\\ here 
between Si10.000 and '1 5,000 

wort h of equ ipment had been 
stolen," ullivan, ' mith \ 
superior sa id . " We imme-
diat Iy ca lled the police. " 

"Then (t hai "ame mornlllg) 
we asked the l'CSJ) poli ce 
whet her il wuu Id help or hurt 
to g t publi c il~ . (! got 
permission fir~t ) beca u-.; e I 
dldn't \\'ant to scre\\ up an) 

l ead~ the police might have 
had." Sulli\'an said . 

By Wednesday e\'en ing. the 
unident ified per.,on who 
watched t he evening new:-.. 
informed'i he l ICS !) police that 
Solomon and Thom p~on had 
the stolen equ ipment at thClr

Union fights for printer's job 
BY BILL F I H 

a nd TIM PICKWELL 
After ten years in the 

uni vers it y's Graphics and 
Reprodu c t ion ervices, 
Anthony Co.-tello wa ' 
dismi ssed for what hi ' 
' upervisor claimed to be 
u naccept able performance 
level. 

His supervisor for seven 
years, J. Bryan Powel\. 'ays 
the dismissal was due to 
Costell o's "continual low 
product ion, r quality, and 
co ·t Iy reru ns and delay· ... 

"It is all lies. They have 
fal sified all figures regarding 
my product ion and quotas for 
quite a few years," Costello 
co nt e nd s. The vetera n 
pressman believes he is the 
'ubject of age and health 

discriminat ion by Powell and 
ervices Assistant Ma nager 

Jim Graham. 
Costello. who has leukemia 

and who had an entire hip 
repla ced fo ur yea r s ago, 
believ . hi ' work unaffect ed 
by these disabilities. "1 am 
good. I am the fastest worker 
in graphic ' . I don 't turn out 
bad jobs and 1 don 't cause 
delays. ,. he ·ays. 

Costello, wit h 37 yea rs 
graphics experience, insists 
that it is Powell who is 
in competent. " He is n ot 
qualified - the whole 
department is unorganized," 
Costello ~a\'!>. 

Powell declined to comment 
on Costello 's case. " I think it 
would be a little premature to 

comment on th is case before 
the trial. '· 

The Emp l oyee / Labor 
Relation ' Grievance Trial was 
request ed by Costello and his 
union , the American Federa-
tion of State, Count y and 
Municipal Employees, after 
s tep ' I and II of the greivance 
process de t ermined that 
Costello had a valid complaint. 

"Things like this happen all 
the time, " said Kat hy Esty, 

p~esident of the local AF CME 
chapt er. 

This is not the first time 
that Powell and Graphics and 
Reproduct ion Sen-ices has 
come under union fire. A 
G1Iardiall article (March 14, 
1979), not ed thaI many 
employees felt hara ... ..,ed. Five 
resigned their jobs . six 
received "warnings," four 
received "intents t o be 
dismissed." four other!> were 
rea signed , and one was 
directed to work on unsafe 
equipment and was electri -
cally ·hocked . 

Costello feels that the UCSD 
graphics equipment i ' 
outdated and unreliable. 

"Five presses at the 
Distribution Avenue plant are 
non-functioning," he says. 
"The servicing co mpan y 
refu sed to repair equipment , it 
was in s uch bad s ha pe." 

Costello complain: that his 
age and medical disabilities 
have drawn intense scrutiny. 
" I have gone to three doctor ' 
recently, and have had three 

perfect physicals. In that same 
period only one o(her employee 
has undergone an examina-
tion." 

In a recent letter explaining 
Costello' · di 'missal, Powell 
maintains that "t here are 
other employees in the 
department who are older ... 
and there are also employees 
wi t h physica l handicaps. 

whose performances are 
accept able." 

"If t here are any people older 
in the department," challen-
ges Est y, ''I'd like t hem to 
prov e it." 

"People are my lifeand I love 
the kids," Costello says. "Now 
I am righting for my job and 
my life_"

AS will consider KSDT fate 
By LISA SULLIVAN 

A!roosodat~ News Edilor 
The futu(e of campus radio 

station KSOT may be decided 
at Wednesday's meeting of the 
A 'sociflted S( udents Council. 

At issue is whether to 
a llocate $10.000 of the AS 
budget to KSOT despite their 
inability to broadcast to 
student ' on campu s_ The 
s tation now btoadcasts via 
cable to a potential audience of 
nearly 38,000 San Oiegans, 

La~t quarter KSOT was 
broadcasting on campus u 'ing 
a transmitter buill atop Tioga 
Hall. However. KSOT was 
temporar ily shut down and 
forced to remov e th e 

transmitter this summer 
when the Student Center 
Board learned that it violated 
FCC regulations, 

Officials of KSOT believe 
that t he underl ying reason 
why t he AS shut dc)\\'n KSDT 
and t mporarily froze their 
budget was not becall~e of I he 
illegClI transmitter, bUI ralher 
because of an int en'i '\\ the 
station broadcast in Jul~' \\"ith 
Ku Klu x Kla n Grand J)ragon 
Tom Met zger. 

All hough KiJST says it was 
not endorsing Met zger's racist 
views, a group of about 13 
protesti ng students including 
AS pre~ident Jules Bagneris, 

felt that im'iting Metzg r on 
campus was an endorsement 
in itself, and I hey proceeded to 
take punitive actions against 
KSOT. 

K 01' continued to assert 
their right of f recdom of 
speech. but decided to 
volun tari lv f;hut down the 
station ";n an act of good 
fa ith ," so that the conflict 
might be talked out. 

Failing thif;, the Student 
Center Board voted to shut 
down K ' OT , officiallY 
reasoning t hat the presence of 
Metzger on campus s howed "a 
flagrant disregard for student 
and facililY safelY ,"

BUl "hen the board learned 
that the AS only had 
jurisdiction over the office 
space of KSDT. and not over 
it s equipment. peopl e or 
operations, it decided to simply 
freeze the station' s budget. 
Their budget remains frozen 
to this day_ 

Bagneris openly admits his 
anger with KSOT for having 
Metzger on campus. but denies 
that this is the reason for 
withholding the $10.000 in A 
funds, He simply is holding 
true on a campaign promise.

N ew geothermal energy source 
As fossil fuel resources 

dwindle, the US ",ill become 
increasingly dep ndent on 
alternate sourc s of energy. 
Geothermal energy, literally 
eart h-heat, has been on of the 
many avenues explored. 

ature sometime~ mixes 
underground water with hot 
rock and the resu lt ing steam 
and heated water becomes a 
source of energy. Scientists at 
the Los Alamos National 
Laboratory are experimenting 
with another source of 
geothermal energy: hot dry 
rock . The basic idea is to 
art ificially reproduce the 
conditions found in nature. 

The energy is extracted 
from very hot underground 
granite formations . A bore 
hole is drilled deep into the 
solid rock and cold water is 
forced down the hole at very 
high pressure causing the 
surrounding rock to crack and 
fract ure. A second hole is 
drilled which intersects the 
fract ured area, and complet es 
the circuit. 

Water pumped do\\'n the 
fir~t (injection ) hol e is heated 
as it f1o\\'s through the 
f ra ct ur ed rock and IS 

reco\' red through t he second 
(extraction or production) hole 
where its heat is transferred to 
liquid Freon. The Freon 
vapo riz es and runs a 
lurbogenerator which pro-
duces electricity. The cooled 
water is pumped back down 
the inject ion hole and t he cycle 
begi ns again . 

The idea is very st raight 
forward but there are many 
technical problem ' encoun-
tered in actual testing. In an 
experimental hot dry rock 
system, the bore holes were 
about 1.8 miles deep and the 
rock wa ' at 390 degrees 
Fahrenheit. The technology 
for dri lling holes at such high 
temperatures and great dept hs 
did not exist before the project 
and had to be developed as the 
need arose. 

The experimenta l system 
generated fi ve megawatts of 
thermal energy and a new 

re~earch system is under 
cuns t ruct ion which will 
generate at least 3:; mega· 
watt s. Thi :-- power may be 
used by nearby communities. 
The injection hoi in the new 
project is t hrec miles deep in 
granite \\ here temp rature~ 

reach ed O\'er 620 degree~ 
Fahr nh it. The ex traction 
hol e \\'a ~ completed this 
su mmer and is more than t\\'o 
and a half miles deep. It will be 
some time before the new 
system i~ operational, but the 
fracturing which will connect 
the two holes shou ld begin in a 
few months. 

A serie ' of tests have been 
run to determine t he long term 
effect s of a commercia l size 
system . The system did not 
cause any earth tremors, and 
the local water system, the 
hydrology, was not ·affected.ln 
addition, the water circulated 
was very pure and there were 
none of t he corrosion or sea ling 
problems which are associated 
with naturall y oceuring 
geothermal sources. 

The hot dry rock program i~ 
drawing int ernational 
attention, espec ia ll v from 
eountrie~ which arc ' highl~' 
dependent on fos~il fuels . 
Japan and West Germanv ha\'e 
scient ists. participating -in the 
program and each cou ntry i~ 
funding the project in the 
order of $2.5 million a year for 
up to four \'ear~. -

Science, politics: 
a commentary 

By THOMA RBACH 
Robert Gillette of the Los 

Allgeles Times reports that 
Jewish scientists in Moscow 
have been warned not to 
conduct informal scientific 
seminars in their homes. Most 
of these scientists hav applied 
for and been refu sed 
permi 's ion to emigrate. As a 
re~ult , many ha\e lost their 
re earchjobs and contact with 
the scientifi c commu ni ty. 
Some have been t hreatenCd 
with expu lsion from the 
capit al if t hey continue the:--e 
informal meeting~ . If histor~ 

teache~ us anything, expu l· 
sion means internal e:-.ile, and 
intellect ual isolat ion 

The catalyst for thi:-- latest

History I05Q - Politics 
Italian Renaissance Style 
Machiavelli & Guicciardini: 
the crisis of the Renaissance 
State 
The purpose of this course is to examine 
the relationship between rhetoric and 
history. Two great contemporary figures 
grappled with the problems of the citizen 
and the state, ideal and reality. What was 
the Rena issance state? What was the 
relationship between virtu and fortuna? 
What were Machiavellian politics? How 
were they modified by Guicciardini? Why 
is their political science the origin of 
modern political thought?

Science,

p ople gradua ll y began to 
recogni.~e thi s fact. The 
IX)litical and economic power 
of today 's government" arc 
underwntten in large part by 
t heir 'defense posture.' The 
nat ional defense capabilil y is a 
direct product of science. In 
fact. much of today 's research. 
applied and pure. is funded by 
the government's defen se 
agen cies. As a result, scientific 
emerprise has become part of 
the political process. 

However, th neutrality of 
science is a persistent myt h. 
The text books teach us much 
about the workings of science. 
hut nothing about the 
. sponsibilities of science . If 
science were not hing more 
t han ph y~ ica llaws our present

very good). If you are familiar with science or 
writing or are willing to learn, contact Tom 

Urbach at 452-3466 or better yet, come by The 
Guardian office in the old Coffee Hut building 

and we'll talk. In addition to our regular 
features, the science section welcomes 

individual contributions. If you have written 
something you would like to submit or have an 

idea, bring it in and we will discuss it.

M ickev Thomas' second solo 
album resembles a football 
team t hat co mes from behind 
in t he second half and loses bv 
a field goal. H sa\'es all thO 
good material for ~ide two, but 
it's just not quite enough to

Thumas, currently lead 
.. inger for th e Jeffer so n 
Starship, fluet uat es between 
rhythm and blues and straighl 
rock on A Ii/le A /oJl e. If you are 
looking for the kind of power 
he deliv rs on tarship 's 
"Jane" or "Girl With the 
Hungry Eyes ," th closest he 
comes is on "r Don't Wanna 
Talk About [t OO and "Survi-
yor" (wr itten by Cindy 
Bullens). 

The ten song LP feat ures the 
guitar work uf Don Felder of 
the Eagles and the SI arship's 
Craig Chaquico which is the 
highpoint of the albu,n. 
Especially on "Too Mu ch 

Drama' \\ hich \\'as written b\ 
lIenle\' ilnd Glenn Fre\ and 
originally scheduled f(ir the 
Eagle:-' The LOJlg 1<//1/ album. 

Since Thomas didn 't write 
an} of the song~, this album 
has no t heme or base (it does 
have bass performed by 
George "Chocolate" Perry ). 
The songs are well written and 
Thoma ' has a nice voice, but 
there is not hing t hat grabs you 
and mak s vou listen. 

He saves' the b st for last. 
The old Eric Clapton - Georg~ 

records 
Harri so n tune "Badge 
recorded first by Cream in 
1969 closes out the al bum. But 
it is too liltle too late. 

Thomas pro\'ed his ability a 
while back with Elvin Bishop 
and mor r centl\' with the 
Stan.hip where he has 
d lil'ered consecut iye hi ts, but 
Alii'£' Alulle doesn ' t pack the

must go to producer Bob Ezri n 
who has worked wit h Pink

East 
Cold Chisel 
Elektra 

Just as the Litt le River Band, 
AC-DC, and Angel City did 
before, Cold Chisel comes to 
America boasting that they are 
the mo ·t popu lar band in 
Australia. What is going on 
down there? 

East is their third album and 
first to be released here. Their 
previous two. Cold Chisel and 
Breallfast Al Sweetheart's went 
gold and platinum respect 
ively, The impressive thing 
about this band is its diversity. 
All five members contributed 
songs ranging from blues rock 
to a reggae beat to straight 
ahead rock and roll. 

Their lyrics are contempo-
rary and political. The life of a 
Vietnam vet is depicted in 
"Khe Sanh" and the police's 
closure of a popular youth 
hangout in "Star Hotel " are 
prime examples of the sharp 
writing that ha ' become a 
trademark of the group in their 
homeland. 

"My Baby" has the most 
a cess iblesound on the al bum 
and has even generat ed air 
play here, but " Rising Sun " 
and " tar Hotel" are the best 
tracks. Rocking is what they 
do be ·t and when they dev iate 
from that their performance is 
quest ion able. 

Overall Ensl has many 
·trong points and show why 
the band has achieved their 
success_ However, Cold Chisel 
could be in for a rude 
awa kening in the critical 
United tat es. 

EI Rayo-X 
David Lindley 
Asylum 

A p rfect description of 
Da\'id Lindley's new album 

\'.:ould take onl\' one word -
Smorga:sboard. 'On EI Rayo-.'\ 
there arc 12tu nes from all 0\ er 
the wor ld and frOIll years past. 

Lindley i ' best known for his 
session work wi t h such stars 
a ' Li nda Ronstadt, Ja mes 
Taylor and Jackson Brown . 
Browne returned the favor and 
co-produced thi :s record \\' lI h 
Greg Landanyi. This albu m is 
a departure from his previous 
work . Laced with reggae . 
Li ndley also mix s in rock, 
blues even a French and 
Spanish song on th is LP which 
follo\\'s along t he li nes of R v 
Cnoder's recent albums, which 
Lindley played on. 

T he hi t single off this a lbum 
is t he rocking remake of K.C. 
Douglas' "Mercury Blue~" 
whic h has receil'ed hea\'\ air 
play. Another fami liar tune is 
t he classic "Twist and Shout" 
done here to a n'ggae beat. He 
went way back to the '5Os and 
pulled ou t " Bye Bye LOl e." 

He pla ys a va ri e ty of 
in truments throughout both 
s ides and achieves some 
unique ·ounds. The songs are 
meant to be humorous and 
entertaining, t his is not a 
heavy serious album and it 
shows in Lindley 's approach . 

El Rayo-X is a little different 
than anything else around. 
Not great. not bad , but 
different. 

Duran Duran 
Duran Duran 
Harvest 

The most interesting thing 
about Dura n Duran is their 
name. which comes from the 
Jan e Fond a sci-fi film 
Barbarell a. 

Their firs t si ngle "Planet 
Earth" is a pop, new-wave 
number som I here along the 
lines of Roxy Music or t he B· 
52 ' but doe::,n ' t come close to 
the excitement of the latt er. 

The songs on this debu t 
al bum run toget her ~o fa st and 
have such an identical beat 
that it makes it di ffi cult to 
dist inguish between songs. 
Producer Colin Thurston did 
too good of a job on this record 
and it ends up too polished and 
completely absent of feeling or 
life. 

The band, imon L Bon, 
Nick Rhod s . lohn Ta lor, 
Roger Ta ylor and And y 
Taylor , n ed so met hing , 
anyt hing, to acid lif to their 
mus ic. Listening to f)uran

If you like an, of the 
fo llowing groups: Def Leppard

T h ,corplon, hay!':' "e got a 
gro. for you. Riot's third 
a lbum Fir£' D01l'1I { Tlldl'l' can 
onh' be described a~ hean 
nleial. -

A good example of \\ here 
Ihl~ group is coming from is 
the tit le of their fir~t song 
"Swords and Tequ ila" nol to 
mentIon the titlt' track. The 
music is loud and It IS fa ... \. You 
can practically hear Ihe sweal 

. fly as this . ew York based 
band tean, from song to ..,ong. 

Riot feat u re~ the :standard 
hard rock line-up, v,:ith Mark 
Reale gu it ar , Sandy lavlll 
drums, Rick Ventura guit ar, 
Guy Speranza vocals and Kep 
Leming bass. 

They h ave i mpr ove d 
considerably since their debul 
in 1977 with Rock Cily. 
Although . the quality of Fire 
Down Under isn't outs tanding 
and the music isn' t extraordi-
nary, it doe boa t the raw 
en ergy tha t all head bangers 
are looking for and could place

DON,. BE 
DISAPPOINTED 

Hey, we know you're just getting 
settled back at UCSD, Your rent probably 
wound up a little more than you 
expected, and OUCH! the price of books 
hurt this year, So the time has now come 
to get some two-wheeled transporta-
tion and you figure you'll recoup some 
of your losses and get a bargain on one 
of those nationally advertised discount! 
department store bicycles. 

HOLD IT 
Buying an IMITATION 

BICYCLE is FAI 5E 
ECONOMY 

Sure, you can save a couple of bucks 
on the init ial purchas~ if you buy a 50-
called bicycle from Sears, K-Mart, Pep 
Boys, Montgomery Wards, or any of a 
number of other discount department 
stores . 

And you'll get a poorly designed, 
weakly constructed, sloppily machined, 
,II-fitting, Inadequately assembled p,le of 
steel With a flaShy oa nt jOb that '5 out 
together for the sale ~urpose of 
securing your dollars ~hrou9 Its 
ourchase, And it Will cost vou much 
more in repaIrs 'n the First 6 mont'lS tr-at 
you own It in a vain attempt that you Will 
maKe trying to get It to ride like the bike 
you thought you d purchased, 

Do yourself a favor. 
The La Jolla/San Diego area has plenty 

of profeSSional bicycle dealers who 
have your best Interests in mlno. They're 
in busllless to prOVIde you with a quality 
b ike. Hopefully it w ill insp ire you to cycle 
more and return to their establishments 
seeking increased horizons and better 
performance, Don't worry about getting 
ripped off. You really w ill get what you 
pay for, and nowhere is price 
competition more alive than in the 
bicycle industry. 

We'd like it if you'd drop by to check 
us out. We're a Full Service, Non-Profit 
shop established for the sole purpose of 
meeting the cycling needs of the UCSD 
Community. 

Regardless of your budget, give real 
cycling at least a look.
