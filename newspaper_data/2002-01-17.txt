Proposed 
budget 
supports 
higher ed 
DC students 
funded despite 
large shortfall 
By EVAN McLAUGHLIN 
Associate News Editor 

Gov. Gray Davis released his 
proposal for the state budget for fis-
cal year 2002-03 last Thursday. 
Davis' proposed budget, while still 
making expected cuts due to 
California's estimated $12 billion 
shortfall, would fund 7,100 full-time 
students university-wide without an 
increase in mandatory student fees. 

Since his gubernatorial campaign 
in 1998, Davis has vowed to make 
public education his first priority. 

"We appreciate the governor's 
effort to maintain support for high-
er education during such difficult 
economic times," said UC 
President Richard C. Atkinson.,., 

Margaret F. Pryatel, assistant VIce 
chancellor of resource management, 
said she is satisfied with the appro-
priations made to the University of 
California during the economic 
slump and believes that the finalized 
budget will more or less reflect 
Davis' commitment to education. 

"For being in the economic sit-
uation we are currently in, it is a 
good budget in that sense," Pryatel 
said. "Quite frankly, I believe that 
the governor did the best that he 
could in this situation." 

Last October, Davis issued exec-
utive orders requiring state agencies 
to freeze the hiring of new employ-
ees to compensate for the expected 
economic downturn. While the 
University of California is not a state 
agency, university officials were well 
aware that reductions in spending 
would be made and heeded the gov-
ernor's advice. The University of 
California also prepared scenarios 
for spending cuts of up to 15 per-
cent, as did all state agencies. 

"When the university had 
anticipated cuts [UC Vice 
President of Budget Lawrence C. 
Hershman] had hoped that specific 
cuts would be made, not just across

Pipes ready: The insertion of larger sewer pipes under Gilman Drive was 
scheduled to begin yesterday; much of southbou~d Gilman will be closed. 

Gilman Drive will 
close for five months 
Construction adds sewer lines for 
UCSD and surrounding residences 
By KECIA R. FELTON 
Staff Writer 

A sou thbound section of 
Gilman Drive will be completely 
closed due to construction of a 
major sewer line by the city of 
San Diego, which was scheduled 
to begin Wednesday. 

A portion of Gilman Drive, 
beginning at Villa La Jolla Drive 
and ending at Interstate 5, will 
remain closed for about six 
months. 

Northbound traffic, bicycle 
access and bus routes are not 
expected to be affected by the 
construction project. 

UCSD Campus Community 
Planner Milton ). Phegley said 
that traffic on campus is not 
expected to suffer any significant 
changes. Traffic leaving UCSD 
and attempting to access 
Interstate 5, along with traffic 
coming from the freeway to cam-

pus, will encounter significant 
setbacks. 

"I think the effect of traffic on 
campus itself will be minimal, but 
for people trying to leave campus, 
[the effect] will be significant," 
Phegley said. 

The sewer line, called the 
"UCSD Trunk Sewer," serves the 
UCSD campus, residential devel -
opments west of Interstate 5 and 
along Gilman Drive south of Villa 
La Jolla Drive and other sur-
rounding areas. The sewer line 
stretches from Via Alicante to 
Interstate 5. 

Built in 1958, the current 
sewer line is just 15 inches in 
diameter and must be replaced to 
provide for increased capacity and 
future development. 

The project will involve the 
installation of about 5,900 linear 
feet of new 24-inch diameter

Diversity is focal 
point of lecture 
University of Michigan professor 
reflects on affirmative action issues 

Sam Soov/os/Guordian 

Long talk: Nationally recognized author Sylvia Hurtado discusses affirmative 
action with several students at the Cross Cultural Center on Tuesday. 

By REBECCA WOOD 
Staff Writer 

Author and nationally recog-
nized expert on higher-educa-
tion diversi ty issues Sylvia 
Hurtado spoke to UCSD stu-
dents and staff in the Cross 
Cultural Center on Tuesday. 
Affirmative action admissions 
lawsuits involving the University 
of Michigan and other issues 
affecting diversity in higher edu-
cation were addressed. 

Hurtado discussed her work as 
an academic and researcher. She 
explained how her research was 
used in the pending University of 
Michigan lawsuits, one of which 
is expected to be appealed to the 
Supreme Court. 

Hurtado also explained how 

important diverse peer interac-
tion is to learning in collegc. 

"Concepts, vocabulary, altru-
ism and political attitudes are 
learned in conjunction with 
peers," she said. 

Hurtado sa Id that lawyers 
worlcing on the Michigan lawsuit 
asked her, "How do we know 
that education is better with 
diversity in the classroom?" She 
said that the lawyers were look-
ing for empirical data as evi-
dence. From research done at 
the University of Michigan 
involving 88 graduates who were 
scored on so-called "democracy 
outcomes," which included lead-
ership, cultural awareness and 
civic participation, Hurtado

The University of CalifDrnia Regents met at Covel 

Commons on the UCLA campus Wednesday' mom-
ing to start their two-day meeting. which will cover 
topics from UC Merced to h""altn care services on 
UC campuses. 

The Wednesday session was scheduled to cover 
actions related to the planning of UC Merced, a dis-
cussion of the graduate eo ucation commission 
report, and a report on Gov. Gray Davis' 2002-2003 
budget proposal. 

An afternoon session was scheduled for a 
dosed-doors discussion of personnel, property and 
investment matters. 

The session on Jan. 17 is scheduled to cover a 
report on the university's educational outreach and 
K-12 improvement programs, action on a proposed 
tuition waiver program for Califomia high school 
graduates subject to nonresident tuition, discussion 
of the university's multicampus research units and 
an update on health care services at several UC

Researchers make flesh-eating 
bacteria breakthrough 

Three unusual patient cases of severe strepto-
coccal infedion have provided clues that allowed 
researchers at UCSD's school of medicine to prove 
that a potent toxin plays an important role in pro-
ducing necrotizing fasciitis, often referred to as 
"flesh-eating disease." 

Working dosely with investigators at Mt Sinai 
Hospital in Toronto and the Centers for Disease 
Control in Ananta, UCSD was able to identify the 
genetic basis for streptolysin production by the A 
Streptococcus bacteria. 

A group of nine linked ~enes was involved in 
SLS production, and a mutatlOn in anyone of the 
genes rendered the bacteria unable to make the 
toxin. 

The patients were unusual because of the fonn 
of strep that caused their flesh-eating infections. The 
cases of Â·flesh-eating disease" were not caused by 
the bacteria usually associated with mild forms of 
strep throa~ but a species of bacteria that rarely pro-
duces serious disease and typically lives harmo-
niously on the skin or the mucous membranes of 
the upper respiratory tract. The toxin produced, 
called streptolysin, is one of the most potent toxins 

known and is able to kill a wide variety of human 
cells in laboratory testing. 

According to the NatiDnal Necrotizing Fasciitis 
Foundation, symptoms can appear to be flu-like at 
first but mDst often occur following a minor trauma, 
surgery, abrasion or even a bruise in otherwise 
healthy, active individuals. 

California unveils 'Homeland 
Defense Bonds' 

In an effort to cover the nSlng price tag for 
defending Californians against terrorism, 
Assemblyman Dario Frommer, a Democrat from 
Glendale, Calif., joined Los Angeles County Sheriff 
Lee Baca in announcing legislation that would allow 
the state to issue "Homeland Defense Bonds~ 

The revenue generated from these bonds would 
help to fund local law enforcemen~ fire departments 
and capital improvements for emergency rooms and 
county health departments. The Donds would be 
sold by the state treasurer. 

Bonds sold to Californians during World War II 
helped to generate nearly $3 billion, according to 
Frommer. The hope is that the sale of these bonds 
could help to cover the estimated $420 million price 
tag that preparing for terrorism would cost Califomia 
in 2002. 

State and local governments have already spent 
Z 142 million on increased security measures 
throughout the state since the Sept 11 terrorist 
attacks.

Student in hospital 
after alleged assault 
Confrontation leaves male victim itl UCSD 
Bum Center and female suspect still at large 
By GEOFF DIETRICH 
News Editor 

UCSD police are actively 
seeking a college-aged woman 
who allegedly tossed hot water 
onto a male UCSD student's gen-
ital area, resulting in second 
degree burns. 

The IS-year-old victim, an Earl 
Warren College resident, was taleen 
to the UCSD Burn Center and 
remains there for treatment. 

On Sunday evening, the sus-
pect - a young, unidentified 
female - arrived at the victim's 
aplrtment carrying a cup of hot 
water, which was thrown OntO the 
young man after a brief conversa-
tion, according to Detective 
Douglas O'Dell of the UCSD 
Police Department. 

The victim was wearing shorts 
at the time of the incident. 

The cup is being held as evi-
dence, and the police said they have 
leai:ls to where the water came 
from. The cup was checked for fin-
ger prints, which are currently 
being processed . 

O'Dell said that up to three 
felonies may have been committed 
in the alleged assault: assault with a 

deadly weapon; battery with severe 
bodily injury; and, depending on 
the intent, burglary with unlawful 
entry. 

UCSD police would not com-
ment on possible motives of the 
incident, saying only that they are 
looking into the possibility that 

'I'm pretty positive we 
will identify who she is. 

I think it would be 
better for everybody 
involved if she came 
forward and told us 
what happened and 

why.' 

- Douglas O'Dell 
UCSDPD Detective 

"something may have occurred at a 
party." 

"Unfortunately, all we have are 
rumors and noi-ody has come for-
ward with what they saw at this 
alleged party," O'Dell said. "We 

~~ ~: 

would love to get a greater under-
standing of what occurred and the 
motives behind this." 

The San Diego Police 
Department would investigate any 
possible crimes that occur off cam-
pus. As of Wednesday afternoon, 
no related off-campus incident had 
been reported to them. 

O'Dell urged the suspect and 
any witnesses to come forward, say-
ing that he does have leads on her 
identity but more information 
would be useful. 

The victim has been coopera-
tive with the investigators, who 
feel that at this time he is being 
forthright with his answers, 
O'Dell said. 

"I'm pretty positive we will 
identify who she is," O'Dell said . 
"1 think it would be better for 
everybody involved if she came 
forward and told us what hap-
pened and why." 

Police describe the suspect as a 
white, college-aged female with 
brown, shoulder-length hair. At the 
time of the alleged assault she was 
wearing a brown sweater. 

Anybody with information can 
contact the UCSD Police 
Department at (858) 534-4359.

Proposal: 
Preuss School budget 
to be cut in proposal. 
Continued from page 1 
our core budget, but to specific 
areas," Pryatel said. 

One specific cut made to the 
UC budget was to the university's 
K-12 outreach program, which 
would see a $4.2 million decrease 
under Davis' proposal. UCSD's 
charter program, The Preuss 
School, would undergo an antici-
pated $422,000 in cuts. 

Davis has, however, kept 
mandatory student fees level. The 
proposal would make 2002-03 the 
eighth consecutive year without a 
systemwide fee increase. 

However, $1 7 million of 
"bonus" funding for financial aid 
will be slashed. These bonus fees 
are monies that the state had 
allowed the university to keep 
when fee reductions of 5 percent 
were made in 1998-99 and 1999-
2000. UC students are projected 
to receive $500 million in schol-
arships, grants and fellowships in 
the next year from both public 
and private sources. 

University officials are con-
cerned with the state's ability to 
maintain its end of the Partnership 
Agreement, a pact beTWeen the 
University of California and the 
state of California to continue its 
improvement toward growth and 
e.'I(cellence. 

"The partnership is an agree-
ment by the state and the universi-
ty where enrollment growth will 
be funded, to a certain level, by the 
state ," Pryatel said. "In the last two 

NEWS 3 
years, the budget we have gotten 
has not fulfilled the partnership." 

Because the University of 
California could not collect on the 
funds promised in the partnershi p, 
it could not fund an additional 2 
percent raise to staff and faculty. 
UC officials are placing this as 
their top priority if any additional 
funding is allocated to the univer-
sity before the budget is finalized. 

"Our faculty and staff are the 
heart of the university, and com-
petitive compensation for them 
remains a high priority for UC," 
Atkinson said. "We will continue 
to seek additional salary funds as 
the state's finances allow." 

Under the governor's proposed 
plan for 2002-03 , the University of 
California would receive $3.4 bil-
lion in funding from the state, an 
estimated $250 million less than 
what was received by the universi-
ty during th~ 2001-02 fiscal yea r. 

To meet these funding alloca-
tions, the budget plan calls for a 
series of three education bond 
measures on the 2002, 2004 and 
2006 ballots. The proposal also 
provides the final TWO years of 
funding for the UC-based 
California Institute of Science and 
Innovation, which includes the 
Institute of Telecommunications 
and Information Technology that 
is to be housed in UCSD's Earl 
Warren College. Funding for the 
Insti tu tes of Science and 
Innovation is made possible via 
lease-revenue bonds. 

The proposal will now make 
its way through the legislative 
budget analyst'S office before 
going before the state legislature. 
T he finalized budget will be 
signed in by June 30.

San O'ego Contents (c) 2002. VIews e"Pressed here,n represent the maionty 
vote of the ed~orldl board and are not nece,sanly those of the UC Board of 

Regent>. the ASUCSD. J1O( the enore GuordlOn staff. 

Useless resolu-
tions are a waste 
of time, resources 

\VHEREAS over the past few months, 
the UCSD ca mpus has been inundated by 
the passage of many gravely worded resolu-
tions; 

\VI-IEREAS such resolutions, such as the 
much-contested "Resolution Supporting 
our National Institutions" passed by the A.S. 
Council on Nov. 28 and the many resolu-
tions passed by college council regarding 
the controversy over The Koala, have no 
executive power or binding influence over 
the activities of those bodies or the quality of 
student life here at UCSD; 

WHEREAS those aforementioned bod-
ies exist in -order not only to represent stu-
dent opinion but also ~ctively work to 
address student concerns and needs; 

WHEREAS the needs of the students at 
UCSD are, as always, demanding of full and 
forceful attention; 

WHEREAS one such issue of concern 
should be the continued unwillingness of the 
admi nistration to address students' needs for 
parking, since new structures filled with 
half-empty faculty floors and ever-overflow-
ing student floors are continually being 
built; 

WHEREAS in the absence of additional 
parking on campus, students could benefit 
from expanded shuttle services as have been 
proposed but not enacted by such bodies as 
the A.S. Council; 

WHEREAS the A.S. Council is intended 
to represent the will of the students, and the 
will of the students is consistently insuffi-
ciently valued by the administration (as was 
the case with the recent change to passing 
period length), and more vocal opposition 
on the part of the A.S . Council could result 
in students' needs being better served; 

WHEREAS college councils must now 
devote time and effort to ensuring quality 
commencement ceremonies for their stu-
dents as the administration has discontinued 
all-campus commencement, heightening the 
importance of the ceremonies of individual 
colleges; 

THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that 
the Guardian decries the wasted time spent 
on such resolutions when much more press-
Ing Issues demand the attention of bodies 
representative of UCSD's students; 

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that we 
support, should the bodies offer that they 
have nothing better to do than heatedly 
debate and then tventually pass useless reso-
lutions, proactive efforts to improve the 
quality and character of student life at 
UCS D; 

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that any 
more :Jttempts by students or organizations 
to propose and pass such pointless resolu-

OPINION 

JOHN WAlKfR lINDH, A GIFT FROM PRESIDENT BUSH. 
Kenrid< Leung/Cuardian 

A misguided pursuit for justice: A 
case for abolishing the death penalty 
The United States must discontinue the practice since the 
legal system has demonstrated it is neither just nor colorblind 
By JESSICA UNGEL 
Contributing Writer 

An eye for an eye. Fight fire with fire. 
One good turn deserves another. There 
are countless aphorisms to the effect that 
every action can and should be recipro-
cated with an equal counter-reaction. 

In reality, things really shouldn't work 
that way. An eye for an eye makes the 
world blind. Fighting fire with fire will 
not get you nearly as far as a reliable 
bucket of water, and one good turn 
deserves nothing more than a little 
acceptance of the fact that sometimes 
that's just the way the world works. 

A pragmatic view of the world under-
stands that such an action-reaction phi-
losophy is doomed. And that is why I do 
not believe in the death penalty. 

Actually, there are lots of reasons, 
aside from my moral tendencies. Let us 
look at the facts. In addition to the fact 
that having the death penalty has not 
been proven to lower homicide rates, if) 
America, the institution of capital pun-
ishment in the United States is both 
racist and alarmingly inefficient. 

The whole point of capital punish-
ment is to keep murderers off the street. 
To allow us to sleep at night, to feel that 
our neighborhoods are safe and free of 
serial killers and psychopaths. Too bad 
having the death penalty doesn't do that. 
AuthorsJohn Sorenson, Robert Wrinkle, 
Victoria Brewer and James Marquart 
examined executions in Texas between 
1984 and 1997. They speculated that if a 
deterrent effect were to exist, it would be 
found in Texas because of the high num-
ber of death sentences and executions 
within the state. (During President 
George W. Bush's years as governor in 
Texa , he signed over 100 warrants for 
the execution of prisoners on death row.) 

Using patterns in executions during 
the srudy and the relatively steady rate of 

murders in Texas, the authors found no 
evidence of a deterrent effect. The study 
concluded that the number of executions 
was unrelated to murder rates in general, 
and that the number of executions was 
unrelated to felony rates. The death 
penalty wasn't proven to scare potential 
murderers into more peaceful pursuits. It 
doesn't deter crime. It wasn't proven to 
actually solve anything at all. 

Even more disturbing than 
killing peo'ple without 
achieving anything is 

taking a long, hard look at 
just who it is we are killing. 
It would be one thing if we 

were unbiased in the 
practice of killing people 

who kill people in order to 
show that killing people is 
wrong. But not only is the 

death pena.lty hypocritical, 
. it is also racist. 

Even more disturbing than killing 
people without achieving anything is tak-
ing a long, hard look at just who it is we 
are killing. It would be one thing if we 
were unbiased in the practice of killing ' 
people who kill people in order to show 
that killing people is wrong. But not only 
is the death penalty hypocritical, it is also 
racist. 

The University of North Carolina 
released a srudy ba ed on data collected 
from court records of 502 murder cases 
from 1993 to 1997 and determined that 
race plays a disquietingly significant role 

in who gets the death penalty. 
The study found that defendants 

whose victims are white are 3.5 times 
more likely to be sentenced to death than 
those with non-white victims. The odds 
that race plays a role in sentencing are 
supposed to be zero. Instead, it turns out 
that the race of the defendant - and 
perhaps even more importantly, the vic-
tim - is a determining factor. 
Regardless of whether someone supports 
the death penalty, he or she cannot sup-
port a discriminating form of it. 

Then there is the fact that we screw 
up a lot when it comes to putting people 
on death row. Since 1973, when the 
death penalty was nationally reinstated, 
99 people in 24 states have been released 
from death row with evidence of their 
innocence. In the state of lIlinois alone 
there were 13 inmates released from 
death row based on concrete evidence of 
their innocence. That number alone 
caused the state's governor to declare a 
moratorium. Most of the falsely convict-
ed prisoners were condemned on what 
later turned out to be forced confessions. 

So just to review, we sentence people 
to death with the idea that we are just 
giving them a taste of their own medi-
cine. Nevermind that the jury tends to 
reach a'racist conclusion based on faulty 
evidence. Nevermind that killing them in 
the name of preventing future murder is 
a double lie; first, it does not positively 
lower homicide rates, and second, it 
involves the murder of the inmate. All 
the facts and studies aside, what really 
makes this instirution wrong is the fact 
that we have no right to decide whether 
someone deserves to live or die. We have 
no right to determine the value of human 
life. 

Yes, murder is wrong. Yes, it is horri-
ble, lamentable and despicable, and peo-

THURSDAY, JANUARY 17, 2002 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5 

Surprise, surprise: Women are freaks Penalty: Many flaws exist in 
current system 
Continued from page 4 basically 

I have come to the disturbing conclu-
sion that over half of 
the world's population 
consists of freaks. For 
the sake of clarity, we 
shall call these people 
by their formal title: 
women. 

Don't get me wrong - I am a 
woman and, therefore, a freak. 
This is because (I don't want to get 
too subtle here) all women are just 
plain retarded. 

OK, I know what's going on 
right now. Every guy reading this is 
nodding and thinking, "My God, 
she's right. Women are freaks." 
Meanwhile, every female is doing 
either one of two things. They are 
either in the throes of a full-on 
hissy fit (which is so not helping you 
disprove my point), or they are 
coming to grips with the fact that 
I'm right. If you fall into the latter . 
category, I congratulate you for 
your emotional maturity and 
asruteness. But you're still a freak. 

What is my reasoning for mak-
ing such a rash and socially repre-
hensible statement? Ha! I'm glad 
you aSKed! 

My main basis for the assertion 
that women are weird (and this 
should have been obvious from the 
beginning) is Leonardo Di-fucking-
Caprio. Whoever made that man a 
sex god has to be absolutely insane. 

But I have other reasons, too. 
And they arm't George Clooney. 
(Two words: Gag me.) 

For example, why do women 
always have to pee? Surely our blad-
ders can't be that much smaller than 
men's. I mean, just because our 
ovaries happen to be taking up space 
in there doesn't mean that our blad-
ders are the size of M&Ms (though 
that does conjure up a lovely mental 
image, doesn't it'). 

And not only are we in the bath-
room every five seconds - we're 
there ;7/ groups. Groups! Why? 
What the hell is so scary about 
being in the 

biles were meant for personal 
grooming. 

Ladies, I cannot say this 
enough: You are not supposed to 
put on makeup in the car. You are 
not supposed to apply andlor dry 
your nail polish. And you are defi-
nitely not, under any circum-
stances, supposed to daydream 
about George Clooney. 

The car was meant for going as 
fast as you can without getting in 
the way of other people. In other 
words: Quit driving liKe a woman 
and just drivt. Repeat after me: It is 
OK to change lanes ... Signaling is 

my friend ". I can 
bathroom alone? 
I have seen the 
srudent body at 
this school, and 
let's face it, it's 
not like our asses 
are so small we're 
afraid of falling 
111. 

Maybe I'm 
being a little crit-
ical of women on 
this point, 
though. So we 
bond via urina-

Don't get me wrong 
I am a woman 

and, therefore, a 
freak. This is 

because ( I don't 
want to get too 
subtle here) all 
women are just 
plain retarded. 

go the speed limit. 
OK, let us 

examine the evi-
dence so far. 
Women can't hold 
their urine, walk 
into bathrooms 
unless enforcing 
the buddy ::ystem 
or drive. But it 
gets worse. 

Why is it that 
the estrogen-
inclined people of 

tion. After all, men bond by beating 
the shit out of each other and then 
comparing car engines. (By the way 
guys, "engine" is not a synonym for 
"penis." Trust me, I looked it up) . 

But that brings me to another 
point: . Women can't drive. And 
there are actual statistics to back 
me up on this point - women are 
the cause of more accidents than 
alcohol and Barry White com-
bined. 

OK, that [ made up. But it is a 
proven fact that women cannot 
operate cars like normal human 
beings. This is because females 
somehow got the idea that automo-

the world get 
tired after one throw of a football 
(assuming, of course, they weren't 
too afraid to break a nail), but they 
can shop for hours without skip-
ping a beat? 

Say you're a woman at a mall. 
You step into a store and spend at 
least an hour circling at least twice 
looking for the perfect article of 
clothing. You don't find it, but that 
other shin is just "to die for." You 
spend 20 more minutes looking for 
it in your size. You head to a dress-
ing room. You disrobe. You try on 
. aid shirt. But wait! What's this? It's 
too small? Well then it's back on 
with the clothes and back out to 

find a bigger size, and now it's back 
into the dressing room and holy 
shit aren't you tired yet? Do you 
have any idea how much energy 
you have wasted on this shirt that 
just makes you lOOK fat? (and that 
looks exactly like the one you have 
hanging in your closet or that you 
wore the night before ... etc., etc.). 

All right, I may be getting car-
ried away. All I know is, the bath-
room and the mall are simply not 
places that people should be spend-
ing the majority of their waking 
hours. Especially not if there is 
drag racing to be done. 

But perhaps the most convinc-
ing argument that women are 
abnormal is just the stuff they say in 
regular conversation. For example, 
the question "Do you think that 
girl is prettier than I am?" should 
never tV" be asked. Yet women aSK 
it! All the time! It may vary to 
include "Do you think I'm fat?," 
but it's pretty much the same non-
sense. 

And why can't girls ever say what 
they are angry about? It's not a cliche 
- I have actually heard women use 
the phrase "Well if you don't know 
why I'm mad, then I'm not going to 
tell you." Give me a break! 

But my all-time favorite is the 
p::tented "AHHHHHHHHHH-
l-llffil A spider!" Umm, has it 
escaped your attention that you are 
approximately 5,000 times the size 
of that arachnid, and that it is 
crawling away from your gigantic 
ass? That spider has absolutely no 
intention of attacking anyone, let 
alone a hysteri(;al woman. Guys, 
next time just tell her to shut the 
hell up and kill it herself. 

So basically - I cannot stress this 
point enough -- women are freaks. 
Now if you'll excuse me, I've had to 
pee for the last six paragraphs. 

pIe who commit murder should 
not be allowed to exist in free 
society. First, we should make 
sure that we convict people 
based not on the color of their 
ski n, . but the concrete and 
indisputable evidence of their 
guilt. Second. we should not 
aspi re to play God and pretend 
to know whether someone 
deserves death. We cannot pos-
sibly subscribe to an eye-for-
an-eye mentality. If people are 
guilty, if they have violated 
someone's right to life, then 
punish them. Go ahead. Lock 
them up, make them chop 
rocks all day, put them some-
place where they are surround-
ed by pictures of their victims, 
whatever. Punish them all you 
like. But do not take something 
that was never yours to give.

Masters of 
punk rock 
return with a 
vengeance 
Everlasting Social 
Distortion plays 
familiar tunes at 
Canes on Friday 
By DAVID BYNUM 
Staff Writer 

Social Distortion, the pre-emi-nem fore fa thers of punk rock, will grace the stage of Canes 
priJay night to cap off a short tour 
of small California venues. Social 
Distortion has visited San Diego in 
ellch of its three tours of the new 
millennium. 

Few bands have ,changed the 
face uf their musica l genre as 
greatly as Social Distortion. 
Formed in 1978, the band has 
been in a constant state of self 
reinventation, having gone 
through numerous member 
changes that have given birth to 
four other punk bands. Amid the 
tragica lly wicked lifestyle of Mike 
Ness, the unfortunate brain 
aneurysm of bass guitarist Dennis 
Dahnell and the coming and going 
of countless other musicians, one 
thing remains the same: Social 
Distortion sell s o ut shows in 
California . 

This is due in la rge part to the 
undying passion of Ness, the only 
remaining original member of the 
initial Social Distortion lineup, to 
play music live. 

With eight full-length albums 
t hat do not include two solo 
albums released by Ness in 1999, 
and countless other releases (EPs 
and si ngles), Social Distortion is 
one of the most covered bands in 
the world today. Ally new band 
coming on to the punk rock scene 
realizes the necessIty of covering 
Social Distortion on an album. 
This rite of passage pays homage 
to the living legends that h e lped 
shape the face of punk rock before 
punk rock ever had a face to 
sha pe. 

Their mo t commonly covered 
songs are "Ring of Fire," '''Story of 
M y Life" and "Sick Boy," each 
famous for their hard -rocking sing-
a-long quality. 

When will Social Distortion 
stop touri ng? Although only Ness 
can answer that question, one thing 
is certain : They show no sign of 
slowing. It seems possible that, like 
his bass guitarist, ess will not stop 
until he has to top. As Ness was 
remin ded in 2000 by his band-
mate's death Â· That day could come 
at any moment.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, JANUARY 17,2002 

Through the Decades: a journey through pop culture from the 19505 into the future 
50s 70s 80s 90s beyond 

I 
THB LONC 

AND \vINDIN 
ROAD 

(Editor lIote: Tbis is tbe second in a 
fix-part sen ef chronicling pop C711-
tflre in America. Look to February 
for tbe nfxt installment wbich covers 
the I 970s.) 

T he onset of the 1960s began with the kinl. .. y swivel of Elvis' hips. Who 
would have thought 

that a pelvic thrust would so 
drastically change the land-

scape of American pop cul-
ture? 

It's no wonder that soon "sex, 
drl!gs and rock 'n' roll" became a 
catchphrase as a "youthquake" 

shook the country, giving 
young people a new-found 

sense of freedom. If the 
1950s were a time of 

rigidity when sexuality 
and individualism 
were restrained and 
a mantra of family 
and national sepa-
ratism pervaded 
the social horizon 
of America, then 
the 1960s were a 
time of revolution. 

The 1960s have 

been heralded as a time of 
"counter culture" in the 
United States, but were also 
a time of subcultures and 
multiculturalism. The 
civi l rights, environmen-
talist, feminist and gay 
rights movements 
emerged in the 1960s as 
critical opposition to 
1950s society. With the 
Alabama bus boycott, the 
African-American voice 
emerged and the opinions of 
many other groups quickly per-
colated to the forefront. These 
social movements added texture 
to the previously homogenous 
American culture. 

As rtalian espresso machines, 
French discos and British pop 
musie and fashion became com-
monplace to Americans, a multi-
culturalism emerged. An interest 
in the world beyond the neigh-
borhood swimming pool 
emerged. 

Most inJportantiy, the role of 
the individual emerged. Public 
and private morals changed, 
giving way to frankness and hon-
esty. A sexual liberation gripped 
the nation's youth . With the 

inven-
tion of the birth conrol pill , 
women began to experience 
more freedom as changing social 
standards revamped the belief 
that "a woman's place is in the 
kitchen." 

As the American makeup 
changed with the new era, so did

'Black Hawk' packs brilliance 
Somalian battle revisited with tense, riveting action 
By MARA EVANS 
Staff Writer 

UP until now, it seemed impossible to make a "beautiful" war movie. How can blood, gutS, desperation, fear, 
adrenaline and sheer intensity be made aes-
thetically pleasing? Enter Ridley Scott's lat-
est work, " Black Ha' vk Down." 

In 1993, the East African country of 
Somalia suffered from one of the worst 
famines in global history. Somali warlord 
Mohamed Farrah Aidid held a death grip on 
the nation, which would only begin to loosen 
under the combined forces of the American 
elite Delta Force and Rangers in addition to 
United Nation peacekeeping troops. 

"Black Hawk Down" is the vivid retelling 
of a seemingly simple mission to capture two 
of Aidid's top lieutenants. The mission 
appeared straightforward - estimated time: 
one hour, tops. 

Once on the ground, however, miscalcu-
lations became horrendous life-and-death 
situations, and men who thought they'd be 
back to base for dinner found themselves 
taking heavy fire from hosti le Somali militia . 

As the mission begins to formulate, we 
realize that Staff Sgt. Matt Eversmann Oosh 
Hartnett) is our go-to man. While the otller 
soldiers are goofing around, Eversmann 
plays it cool, taking his responsibili ty as 
"chalk" leader seriously. Yet at the same 
time, he embodies what every man is feeling, 
fear, but is also eager to fulfill his du ties. 

Sam Shepard as Major General William 
F. Garrison seems like he never left his role 
as a fighter pilot from "The Righ t Stuff." As 
he sits in the command office watching his 
men suffer, we can't help but sympathize 
with his helplessness. 

As the helicopters lift off and the all-
American phrase "Let's roll I" is shouted over 
the radio, the visual beauty of the movie 
kicks in. War assaults the senses - touch, 
sight and sound - yet somehow SCOtt man-

REVIEW 

ages to distort all three. 
Each frame of "Black Hawk Down" is so 

colorfully sharp that there is little room for 
gray area. Scott also plays with the sound, giv-
ing us a poignant scene when the helicopters 
zoom toward their targets. The sound is 
turned off and we are left with the quiet seren-
ity of the Indian Ocean, a sharp juxtaposition 
to the chaos that awaits the soldiers. 

The scenery of the movie is clipped and 
the strictly militaristic dialogue is brusque as 
well . Because a majority of the dialogue is 
delivered over the radio waves, it's no won-
der the messages are garbled and mistakes 
are made. 

The desolate aerial views mask the chaos 
of the citys streets and the perils that the sol-
diers face around each turn . The use of 
extras in "Black Hawk Down" is especially 
powerful because they sim ultaneously 
demonstrate the sheer power of mob vio-
lence and mass weapon distribution. 

It's hard to pinpoint where the power of 
"Black Hawk Down" really lies. While a 
tremendous job is done capturing each indi-
vidual 's spi rit on film as he pulls a trigger or 
helps a wounded buddy, the strength of the 
film is found in watching a 21st century war 
live. "Black Hawk Down" is real - it hap-
pened. And it's happening again. Let's roll.

DVD of the sequel hit comedy hits viewer 
with hours of wholesome fun 
By JOSH CROUSE 
Senior Staff Writer 

The entire cast of 1999's sur-
prise hit comedy "American Pie" is 
bacle: for another slice in "American 
Pie 2," outJan. 15 on DVD. 

The DVD features over 10 
hours of extras mat include me 
making of "American Pie 2," out 
takes and deleted scenes, a public 
service announcement from star 
Jason Biggs, screen tests from me 
original "American Pie," behind-
the-scenes footage, some of the top 
scenes as voted on by fans, classic 
lines from the two movies, com-
mentary from me director, writer 
and cast, as well as a 3 Doors Down 
music video. 

Additional features include 
production notes and links to 
Universal's Web site. 

"American Pie 2" is in the same 
vein as the original, picking up a 
year later wim me gang just finish-
ing their first year of college_ The 
boys decide to rent a beach house 
on Lake Michigan hoping to keep 
meir friendships strong after a year 
apart. Between parties, work, lubri-
cants and lesbians, it turns fnro a 
summer mat nobody will soon for-
get. 

Universal also released the 
unrated version of the film on 
DVD, much like it did wim me 
original. 

Unlike the orir;inal 's unrated 
version, which only had one differ-
ent scene that was obviously

REVIEW 

changed for ratings purposes, me 
new film's unrated version is more 
like a director's cut, which features 
several new scenes that aren't nec-
essarily as shocking. The unrated 
version includes more footage of 
Stiffler's party, the lesbians and me 
lube. 

The extra scenes in the unrated 
version definitely add to me overall 
movie. Some of me jokes that were 
merely implied in me final version 
of the film were explained in me 
unrated version. 

The extras on this DVD are 
amazing and will keep any fan 
occupied for hours , as well as 
rolling on me ground laughing. 

This is a DVD mat any fan of 
me movie - or fan of a good com-
edy - should own. The unrated 
version is probably more appealing 
to own simply because it has the 
extra scenes not found on the orig-
inal.

Revolution: 
The mini skirt changed both 
fashion and music

body. In the 1950s, clothing put the 
emphasis on a womans bust and 
hips. But as one designer put it, 
with the mini-slcirt, "the legs have 
never had it so good." 

When ask.ed what the rrum-
slcirt was all about, Quant's elo-
quent answer was "sex." Her 
response, however, neglected to 
include the idea of choice. 
Confronted with the advent of the 
pill, women became aware that 
they no longer had to "contain 
their sexual and ambitious desires 
within marriage," said 
Cosmopolitan magazine editor 
Helen Gurley Brown, in her book., 
"Sex and the Single Girl." 

In the late 1960s, "hippie" 
clothing began to stimulate free-
dom. Stemming from the mini-
slcirt came .the stylistic daisies and 
the "ethnic look." Jeans, T -shirts 
and long hair became the unisex 
look, which developed from vari-
ous social trends that stimulated 
America's youth to seek. indepen-
dence as a unified group within the 
American population. 

While the mini slcirt redefined 
American fashion, the music indus-
try also played a k.ey role. As more 
people attended concerts, musi-
cians' wardrobes affected popular 
trends. It's no surprise that musi-
cally influenced drug use also 
spark.ed a more psychedelic 
approach to life. 

No Searles? There is, but look to next 
week's Hiatus issue for the conclu-
sion of the 19605.

Communications major 
enjoys challenge 
Continued from page 16 

Woods grew up fast and turned 
to basketball for happiness and 
relaxation when he was young. His 
comfort level on the court encour-

aged him to play to his potential and 
enjoy himself while he was playing. 
This still proves true for him today. 

"Everyone makes an impact on 
the team and improves the team 
dynamic through hard work and 
determination. Jody has had thi s 
sort of effect on the team."

league. but the mere hundreds of 
thousands of dollars they level at 
athletes can be found in the folds of 
their satin sofas . The stars can't be 
traded because the fans develop 
attachments to players and riot 
when their top producers are sent 
away. 

So when dlese ego-driven play-
ers have poor seasons due to injury 
or "not trying their best" or what-
ever, it's the coaches who get the 
axe and several million dollars that 
could be spent on a good offensive 
threat or stalwart defender is wast-
ed on yet another faceless coach 
who desperately attempts to climb 
out of the same holes as his prede-
cessor. 

Maybe when the players start 
feuding with the owners and 
attempt to raise the fans against the 
person who writes their paychecks. 
the owners might be able to finally 
see past the players' egos and see 
what they have created. 

for the love of the game. Woods 
and his teammates are individual 
players who. with their talents. join 
together to achieve a common goal. 

Woods knows that the Tritons 
must constandy battl e to win and 
gain respect in the ever-challenging 
Division II California Collegiate 
Athletic Association. 

That challenge is what Woods 
loves.

ISAAC PEARL\l,\.'\)' 

UCSD rockets in Sears Cup race 
Soccer, volleyball boost UCSD into fourth place 

A s the Super Bowl rapidly 
approaches 

and the fans turn 
their eyes to the few 
remaining football 
teams in contention, 
the dredges of the 
NFL quietly begin 
their spring cleaning 
while trying to gain 
as little attention as 
possible. 

And while the owners of the 
teams can be given credi t for know-
ing the quietest time to get rid of 
the coaches that they personally 
hired a few years ago, one has to 
wonder about the fairness-of their 
cutthroat policies. 

\Vi th names such as George 
Sei fe rt, Tony Dungy and D ennis 
Green now floating in footba ll 
limbo , the questio n is whether they 
rea lly merited the credit for their 
tearri's respective horribl e seasons 
or if m aybe, just maybe, the actual 
players caused their teams to have 
piss-poor sea ons. 

First, the Carolina Pa nthers: 
With a very young Chris Weinke 
thrust into the starti ng qua rterback 
role with no dominant running-
back, what do the owners expect 
Seifert to do? He has no star play-
ers and a defense like a sieve that 
gave up 48 touch downs this year. 

How much impact do owners 
expect coaches to have in actual 
football games? Sure, they are the 
ones selecting the plays, the ones 
implementing offensive and defen-
sive schemes, the chess masters who 
respond to every opponent's move. 
But when it comes down to it, it's 
the players who have to execute on 
the field . 

N ow, the Minnesota Vikings 
are another story. With pouty star 
Randy Moss whining about not 
receiving enough passes and 
telling the press outright on more 
than one occasion that he doesn 't 
try his hardest, the enlightened 
owners decided to dump Green 
instead of their multi-million, 24-
year-old baby. 

Now, I think owners should fire 
coaches if the team refuses to play 
for the coach, but not if only one 
player decides he doesn't like his 
coach because the coach's plays 
aren't padding his stats enough. 

This is a testament to the 
tremendous power individual ath-
letes are gaining today. As stars' 
egos rise along with their pay-
checks, one has to wonder in 
which direction professional 
sports are heading. Back in the old 
days, players were sold or traded 
without having any say in the deci-
sion; now they pretty much have 
their pick of where to go, and for 
what pay. 

And what ca n anybody do to 
stop this trend? T he commi sion-

UCSD found itself in a favor-
able position in the most recent 
National Collegiate Athletic 
Association Division II Sears 
Director's Cup standings, released 
Dec. 2001. 

The Sears Director's Cup is 
awarded annually to the best ath-
letic program in each NCAA divi-
sion. Points are awarded based on 
an institution's finish in up to 14 
sports - seven men's and seven 
women's. Each national champion 
receives 100 points for winning, 
while those whf> made the NCAA 
final s receive between 20 and 90 
points based on their finishes. 

T he Tritons currently have 2 16 
points, 26 more than after last 
year's fa ll season. The Tritons 
ended up fini shing in fourth place 
in 2000-01 , their first season at the 
Division II level. 

"To say 1 was proud [of 
UCS D 's fourth place finish] was 
an understatement," said UCSD 
Athletic Director Earl Edwards. 
"To fi nish fourth was a direct 
reAection on the quali ty of coach-
es and athle te we have at UCSD." 

Teams picking up points in the 
fa ll this year were women's soccer 
(100 points), women's volleyball 
(75 points, third pl ace), and men's 
cross country (41 points, 15th 
place). 

With men's and women's swim-
ming and diving squads appearing 
stronger than last season and the 
fencing team dominating the West 
Coast, the Tritons look to improve 
on last season's 524-point total. 

"I think our chances are rela-
tively good to finish in the top 10," 
Edwards said. 

UCSD will also look to pick up 
points in the spring from the ten-
nis and track and fi eld teams, 
which both scored points last year. 
Edwards is also hoping to get 
points from softball and women's 
crew. 

"I'm hoping based on last year 
- softball came close to qualifying 
for NCAA playoffs - that they 
might be able to pick up some 
points for us," Edwards said. 

The NCAA recently instituted a 
separate Division II championship 
for women's crew (in the past all 
schools competed in one division), 
which should give the Triton rowers 

a chance to pick up points. 
Western Sta te in Colorado leads 

the standings with 260 points. UC 
Davis, however, appears to be in 
the best position to win its third 
consecutive Director's Cup. With 
224.5 points, the Aggies are cur-
rently in third place but are tradi-
tionally stronger in winter and 
spring sports. 

"Their track and cross-country 
teams have been stronger than 
ours in the past, and they are 
helped in that they have a football 
team to earn points and we don't," 
Edwards said. "I do expect we'll be 
doing better in those areas. " 

Davis took home the 2000-01 
award wi th 703 points, after pick-
ing up only 226 points after the fa ll 
season. 

"I acmally have a challenge with 
the Davis athletic director," 
Edwards said. "I told him we're 
going to take it away from them." 

However, Edwards is looking at 
contributions from more than just 
the athletes. 

"I want to take the opportunity 
to thank all the fans," Edwards 
said . "We've already seen 
increased fans in the stands, which 
definitely helps us in the Sears 
Directors' Cup race." 

Woods gives Tritons inside option 
Junior transfer has stepped into leadership role 

Courtesy of UCSD Athletics 
New leader: Jody Woods is leading 
the Tritons in his first year at UCSD. 

By COURTNEY FIELD 
Staff Writer 

Challenge, hard work and 
adjustment are key issues when 
transferring schools, much less 
coming into an already established 
basketball team. Junior forward 
Jody Woods knows them all too 
well. 

After attending a junior college 
in Iowa, Woods decided to further 
his basketball and educational 
career by becoming a Triton. 

The 6-foot-4, 220-pound for-
ward provides head coach Greg 
Lanthier and the rest of the 
UCSD squad with a different 
aspect of basketball. 

"Jody has faced and played with 
an array of people and therefore he 
brings a different background to 
our game," Lanthier said. "His 
maturity as a player and as a per-
son is a big benefit to our young 
team." 

Woods' strong work ethic and 
ability to adjust to playing style has 
earned him a starting SpOt on the 
Triton roster. 

He has started all 15 games this 
season and leads the team with 53 
defensive rebounds. Woods is 
among the team leaders in field 
goals, points scored, blocked 
shots, playing time, assists and 
free-throw attempts. His stature 
inside the key offensively gives the 
Tritons a go-to option at the post 
and allows a team that is perime-
ter-shooting oriented other 
opportunities to score. 

"Jody's size gives our team a 

great advantage. If he gets the ball 
in the post he almost always scores 
or draws a foul. This opens up our 
three-point shooting because 
teams will be concerned about 
Jody in the pOSt and will double 
team him, leaving someone else 
open for a shot," said a teammate. 

Woods believes that his aggres-
sive attitude gives the team a 
greater advantage than his stature. 

"You have to have heart," 
Woods said. "Whoever wants the 
ball will make the plays." 

As the only active junior on the 
team, Woods assumes a leadership 
role along with Triton teammate 
senior Nick Christensen. The 
leadership role and respect has 
come gradually . to J ody. It takes 
time to earn respect, but clearly 
Woods has conquered and has 
overtaken the challenges set 
before him. 

"His addition to the team has 
without a doubt been a major 
change to our team," said sopho-
more guard Cameron Jackson. 
"Jody is the oldest player on the 
team and therefore he's been 
around the block before." 

Averaging 8.2 points per game 
and 5.0 rebounds per game, 

Woods is definitely a force to be 
reckoned with on both ends of the 
court. 

"He brings a more physical 
defense by blocking shots and a 
more potent offense by posting 
up," his teammate commented. 
"Most of us end up following his 
lead, which leads us to play more 
aggressively. He brings motivation 
and a positive attitude when our 
team seems down or flat." 

Besides his physical play, 
Woods gives confidence to the 
team. 

"Along with Jody's experience, 
he also brings a lot of confidence, 
and confidence is contagious. Jody 
often plays with a sort of swagger 
and when we're playing well ; that 
very same swagger can be seen in 
our other players," Jackson said . 
"His size and physicality proves 
that Jody is a versatile body that 
can guard an opponent's more ath-
letic player. Our offense is a think-
ing man's offense and is a tough 
one to learn. However, in his first 
year here, J ody has done a good 
job picking it up and is improving 
consistently as we go along."
