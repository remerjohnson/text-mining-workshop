A.S. concerned about Web photos 
Pictures of students available on Studentlink 
By DANA WEST 
Senior Staff Writer 

Members of the A.S. Council 
met Oct. 9 to discuss its response 
to the administration's decision to 
make student identification pho-
tos avai lable to professors on 
Srudentlink. 

T he council seeks to imple-
ment a waiver that will let students 
choose if they want professors to 
see their ID photos. 

Commissioner of Student 
Advocacy Kyle R. Biebesheimer is 
concerned that students feel that 
their privacy rights are being vio-
lated , especially since students 
were never asked if their pho-
tographs could be posted on the 
Web. 

Assistant Vice Chancellor of 
Enrollment Management Richard 
Backer was unavailable for com-
ment. 

A.S. Vice President External 
Dylan deKervor said she shares 
Biebesheimer's concern and that 
she feels that a waiver option 
needs to be introduced. DeKervor 

said she also fears minority stu-
dents will be uncomfortable with 
the project. 

"Certain people on our campus 
do not feel comfortable here and 
[the project] further ostracizes 
them," deKervor said. 

Representatives for Studentlink 
maintain that they worked closely 
with the Student Policies and 
Judicial Affairs Office to ensure 
that this addition to Studendink's 
functions would not violate the 
Family Education Rights to 
Privacy Act. 

The photos were added to 
Studentlink in June 2001 after 
UCSD faculty members informed 
the Academic Senate of their 
desire to view the pictures. Faculty 
reportedly felt that relations 
between students and professors 
needed to be improved, and that 
this project will enhance the stu-
dent-faculty relationship. 

Assistant Registrar and 
Admissions Officer Myra Webb 
confirmed this, saying, "This was 
a faculty-initiated request through 
the Academic Senate."

Biebesheimer encouraged the 
effort to enhance student-teacher 
interaction. 

"1 support anything that helps 
students and faculty have a closer 
relationship," he said. "I don't 
want to get rid of [the photos) 
altogether. " 

Fadulty now have the option of 
viewing and printing class rosters 
with names and photos from 
Studentlink, although they are not 
required to do so. 

According to a disclaimer on 
Studentlink, the photos are only 
available to UCSD professors and 
students, who may view their own 
photo by clicking on the "Personal . 
Information" link on Studentlink. 

However, a brief paragraph 
under the "What's New" heading 
on the Web site uses the term 
"authorized user" when referring 
to who may access student photos. 

DeKervor said it is misleading 
to say that only professors have 
access to the photos. 

"Pretty much anyone can pull 
it up if they want to," deKervor 
said.

Koala accused 
UCSD humor newspaper 
faces allegations of racism 
By EVAN McLAUGHLIN 
Contributing Writer 

Some students and groups have 
condemned Thr Koaltl for running 
what they call racist mock adver-
tisements and personal ads in its 
first issue of the school year. 

Within the "Forum on the 
Greek System" section of the Sept. 
24 issue, an announcement 
informed readers of a fictitious fra -
ternity named Chi Kappa Alpha, 
nicknamed "The Chikes. " 

The issue also included two per-
sonal ads containing anti-A ian 
messages. One read, "To all tile 
Asians: Nobody likes you, good 
day," whi le another suggested that 
an option should be added to hous-
ing forms to exclude Asians. 

Revelle Junior Senator David 
Cohen complained to the A.S. 
Coundl about the issue's content. 

"I don't believe that 'free speech ' 
equals a derogatory reference to the 
Jewish or any kind of bigotry 
toward Asians or any other ethnic 
or religious group," Cohen stated 

in a le iter to the l:uuncil. "Th.1l i, 
not free speech; it is hate speech, 
and it should not be found any -
where o n the UCSD campu,." 

Koala editor George LIddle \Va, 
unavailable for commel1l on the 
maner. 

Cohen and A.S. PrcSJ(lclll Jeff 
Dodge organized a meeting of I\oal" 
staff members, Union of JeWIsh 
Students President DaVId WeISberg, 
Alpha Epsilon Pi Presidcl1l Lance 
Miller, A.S. Commissioner of 
Communications Catherine Aigen, 
Student Organi zation and 
Leadership Office li aison to the 
Koala Paul Dewine, and members of 
the Srudelll Affirmative Action 
Coalition. 

At the meeting, there was dis-
cussion about whether Koala fund -
ing could be cut because of recent 
incidents. 

A formal complaint was filed 
against The Koalll at a council meet-
ing on Sept. 26, alleging that slan-
derous comments about Muir

NIGMS awards $7.4 million 
to study cell communication 

The National Institute of General Medical 
Sciences has provided a 'glue grant" of $7.4 million 
to a consortium of scientists dedicated to studying 
the carbohydrate function on which cellular commu-
nication hinges. 

The project leader is Dr. James Paulson of the 
Scripps Research Institute and the UCSD School of 
Medicine's Glycobiology Research and Training 
Center. 

Dr. Ajit Varki of the GRTC, along with others is a 
project collaborator. ' 
. Twenty percent of the glue-grant funding is antic-
Ipated to go to UCSD to support core resources for 
glycan analysis and mouse phenotyping. 

Cellular conversation hinges on the sugar mole-
cules that blanket every cell in our bodies. 
Carbohydrates and the plOteins associated with 
them permit cells to transmit and receive the chem-
ical, electrical and mechanical messages that under-
lie everything from growth to thought to movement. 

American Physical Society 
elects UCSD's Anderegg to 
fellowship 

UCSD project scientist Francois Anderegg was 
elected to Fellowship of the American Physical 
Society's division of Plasma Physics. 

He received the award for "experiments quantify-
ing partide diffusion and heat transport due to long-
range ExB collisions in single-species plasmas and 
for the la~r diagnostics and plasma-control 'tech-
niques which enabled these experiments." 

APS elects fellows each year for outstanding con-
tributions to physics. 

Anderegg's award will be published in the March 
2002 edition of APS News.

THUR DAY, OCTOBER II , 2001 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Chancellor laces his shoes for ·5K 
Dynes continues annual bet with A.S. president 
ByJUN MA 
Contributing Writer 

The sixth annual Chancellor's 
Challenge 2001 5K run/walk ben-
efiting UCSD undergraduate 
scholarships, hosted by 
Chancellor Robert C. Dynes, will 
be held Oct. 19 on me cross-cam-
pus course. 

The event will begin on 
RIMA field and will end with 
lunch and an awards ceremony. 

This year's event, like those in 
previous yea rs, will bring togeth-
er corporations and individuals 
from the community, UCSD 
dlulllni, students, faculty and 

~talT. 
OVl'r I , I 00 people participated 

11\ last year's race, which raised 
over $200,000. The proceeds will 
benefit the Chancellor Research 
Scholarship, which gave 96 under-
graduate scholarships as a result of 
last year's challenge. 

To make the event more com-
petitive and to increase participa-
tion, Dynes and evem co-chair 
Charlie Robins will match the top 
sponsors of the event dollar-for-
dollar up to 550,000. As extra 
incentive, me chancellor will make 
a personal donation of 525 for 
eveT)' male who bears him next 
Friday, and the wife of the chan-
cellur, Professor Frances Dynes 

Hellman, will donate S25 for 
every female who beats her. 

"The chancellor is an avid 
runner," said Undergraduate 
Student Affairs Development 
Officer Kyra Randall. "He usual -
ly runs at six in the morning 
either on campus or around his 
home." 

Last year, Dynes placed 124th 
overall wim a time of 22 minutes, 
eight seconds. 

"He's in good shape," Randall 
said. "That is why he is challeng-
ing anybody who decides to join 
the race, from members of the 
cross country team to regular stu-
dents. " 

One lasting tradition in the 
annual run/walk is the competi-
tion between Dynes' adlninistra-
tion and the A.S. Council. Each 
year, a wager is made between the 
two teams and this year's event 
upholds that tradition. 

The stakes: If A.S. President 
Jeff Dodge wins, the chancellor 
will help sponsor the A.S. barbe-
cue; if Dynes wins, Dodge will 
wash the chancellor's car. 

"The rivalry has grown to be 
very competitive and people look 
forward to it," Randall said. 

Groups and individuals spon-
sor the event. Group sponsor-
ships include community, 
marathon, Olympian and the 

Chancellor's teams, with dona-
tions ranging from $500 to 
SIO,OOO. Students can participate 
in the 5K run/walk with a $5 
donation and faculty, staff and 
alumni ca n participate for $10 per 
person. 

Orgal1lzers of the race are 
excited and are encouraging 
everyone to participate by run-
ning, walking, cheering on the 
competitors or becoming a 
Chancellor 's Challenge volun-
teer. 

"The race is a lot of fun," 
Randall said. "( used to run in the 
challenge myself. It's a chance for 
me community, the students and 
me faculty to come together for a 
common cause. The event gets 
everyone involved." 

Entry forms are available on-
line at http://7J)'WW.llml.tdu/Yk and 
can be turned in at the UCSD 
Athletics Department in 
RIMAC, Geisel Library, Scripps 
Institute of Oceanography and 
the Faculty Club. Forms can also 
be mailed to: Chancellor's 5K 
Run/Walk, UCSD Athletics, MC 
0531, La Jolla, CA 92092 . 

The deadline to enter is 
Wednesday, Oct. 17 . Walk-i n 
entries will be accepted until 
noon . For more information, 
contact Kyra Randall at (858) 
822-1537 . 

Koala: 
AS. Council takes no 
action against publication 
continued from page 1 

Quant"'y suff were printed in JW1C 
200 I. This latest controversy funhcr 
strains me publication's relationship 
wim me A.S. Council and student 
groups. 

However, the A.S. Media 
Chaner, Jast amended in March 
1998, states mat "me ASUCSD 
shall not engage in the regulation 
of the content of publications of 
Media in any manner. All responsi-
bility for me content of the publi-
cations of Media is wim the mem-
bers of me respective Media." 

"A lot of people assume the A.S. 
Council has the power to control 
what is printed in our publica-
tions," Algeri said. 

She also said that many individ-
uals and' groups have recently 
approached her to request that the 
A.S. Council discontinue funding 
for The KoaiIJ. 

"We allocate funding on a con-
tent-neutral basis," Algeri said. 

Algeri sa id that if me policy was 
not content-neutral, the A.S. 
Council would be held legally 
responsible for everyming and any-
thing printed wim A.S. funds. 

The A.S. COWlcil's decision incit-
ed frustration among students, espe-
cially after a campuswide anti-hate 
resolution was passed unanimously 
Sept. 26.

behind my back and someone is 
hitting me in the face," Cohen said. 
"The university policies that werc 
designed to protect students now 
stand against mem." 

Algeri noted that UCSD is 
among the few schools tha t sti ll 
sponsor media with student funds. 
Many institutions, she added, have 
dropped funding for publications 
because of instances si milar to the 
Koala scenario. 

A disclaimer on 71Jf Kotlill 
emphasizes mat it runs controversial 
material because of irs shock clTert 
and that mis is what makes the paper 
so popular wi m its readers. 

Meanwhile, the Student 
Affirmative Action Coalition has 
been working on organizing a peri -
odical according to Algeri. It would 
counteract what Algeri ca ll a 
"dominant view" conveyed by J7Je 
Koala, which is the most Widely 
read A.S. Council-funded publica-
tion on campus. 

"Man)! have not been receptive 
to the views expressed by nJr 
Kotlw," Algeri said. 

The new publication is in the 
works and would feature diversi-
ty-related anicles that, according 
to Cohen, would benefit studcms 
in their educati~n of unity and 
tolerance. 

"We shoulJ celebrate our cul-
tural heritage rather than live 
uncomfortably because of II." 
Cohen said. "When ( arrived at

and religious heritage. The primary 
reason I joined A.S. was to keep that

Media loses sight 
of objectivity in 
wake of attacks 

Pmident George \ \ '. Bush's approva l rating 
-:- ,I, l1l ea~ured b~ ' a pubhc opinion poll jointly 

aJllllnt~ten!d b)' L:S,-/ 7iJt/"),, Gallup and CNN 
- ,oared to 90 percent as of Oct. 7. 

This unprecedented level of public support, 
however, points to more than just another 
Bush victor\, in 2004. It indicates that the 
Amcrican p~blic (or at least those represented 
in ~unda y'~ poll) has become devoid of the 
abiliry to react intelligently to the workings of 
the ma~s media. 

American citizens, although justifiably dis-
mayed by the tragic nature of the Sept. 11 
events, have been religiously gl ued to their 
I \ .... radio~ and \reb slte~ , all of which have 
been almost nilly dedicHed to coverage of 
l' llh cr Bush ~ l1loves or \J11CflCa'~ unfolding 
lia r. 

J lowever, besides a few more press confer-
ences and the reqUisite flights to New York 
City, Bus h'~ presitlential behavior and 
demeanor have acmally changed very little 
since Sept. 11. 

But even the poll's authors may have been 
reluctant to admit that fact. One of the ques-
tions asked, "Do you approve or disapprove of 
the way President Bush is handling the cam-
paign against terrorism ~" This question's 
wording left no room for respondents to con-
sider whether Bush has had to do much "han-
dling" in the first place. 

In light of such considerations, Bush's soar-
ing approval ratings are most likely attribut-
able to the fact that the public is simply seeing 
and hearing more of him, since he is now 
being automatically granted headline status 
like neve r before. 

But perhaps what is most disappointing 
reg,lrding Bush's record-breaking 90 percent 
approval rating i. that the record may have 
been broken only due to the fact that 
Amt::rica ns today have greater access to the 

lIl a~s media than in the past. 
Importantly, though he may not have done 

enough to raise his approval rating to such a 
high level in so little time, Bush is not to be 
held responsible for the ease with which the 
public has declared its overwhelming loyalty 
to him. instead, the blame rests with those 
who have forgotten to remain critical thinkers 
at such a crucial time, as well as with those 
who are responsible for turning anything 
Bush says and does into the headlining story 
of the day.

OPINION 

DOING OUR BEST TO END THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE. 
Kenrick Leung/Cuardian 

Regardless of the outcome, 
civilians will pay a heavy price 
The U.S. is caught in a delicate diplomatic 
web as it struggles to punish and protect 

By SIMONE SANTINI 
Senior Staff Writer 

The attack came. In the ni ght, as 
usual, because in the night America has 
eyes, and the enemy is blind. It came, 
and everybody knew it would come: the 
allied, the still mildly reluctant Arab 
countries, the Taliban, and even those 
poor sods who on Sept. II were cheer-
ing in Ramalbh without knowing rhar 
in rhe end. somehow, rhey would be rhe 
ones who would pay. 

European congressman Pi erre 
Lellouche in an interview to the news-
paper Libinlflon, shortly afrer Sepr. II , 
sa id thar this struggle against terrorism 
is nor a war, but rhe 'firsr example of 
what he called the apres-guerre: rhe 
post-WJr. \,vc still don'r know what the 
rules of the apres-guerre will be, but we 
are seeing rhe first chapters unfolding, 
and we can try to understand something 
from them. ' 

The apres-guerre does no t take 
place between countries or between 
cultures, but between partially hidden 
networks of complex political and mili-
tary alliances. As the Bush administra-
tion made very clear, conquering 
Afghanistan, or even forcing the cre-
ation of a friendly government is nor 
one of the goals of this fight. The 
enemy, in the apres-guerre is not clear-
ly discernible, and not easily reconcil-
able with simple national or cultural 
labels: We are fighting against Muslim 
terrorisrs but Muslims have also been 
most of the victims of the terrorists, 
who killed at least 40,000 people in 
Algeria, although, in the west, we knew 
very little about them. 

This leads to the second characteris-
tics of the apres-guerre: the constant 
tension between the public and the 
secret, in which the media playa role as 
important as that of the military. 

This role is evident in two aspects of 
the conflict: the need for some clearly 
discernible actton. and the care taken to 

accompany the military action with 
humanitarian aids . 

As Secretary of State Colin Powell 
has repeated many times, the response 
of the United States is (and will be) 
extremely complex and spread over a 
wide spectrum : political, economic, 
humanitarian and, if necessary, mili-
taristic. All these branches of the 
Americnn response are already in place 
and have been working for some time . 
From the point of view of the informa-

Is there an objective and 
compelling justification for 
bombing Afghanistan ... Or, 

was this spectacular 
military action undertaken, 
at least in part, because of 

its symbolic value? It is a 
terrible thought to think 

that Afghan i citizens ... are 
sacrificing their lives on 

the altar of public opinion, 
but alas, it is not a far-

fetched scenario. 

tion society, however, they present a 
terrible inconvenience: They are either 
long-term efforts, slowly moving 
through embassies and foreign oftlces, 
or are invisible, like the intelligence 
effort and the use of special "comman-
do" troops. 

The society of instant news and 
instant gratification needs something 
more. Sometimes, symbols count as 
much as action, and the attack of last 
Sunday certainly served thIS purpose, at 
least judging from the new wave of flags 
that appeared here and there all over 
San DIego. 

While this flurry of symbols is 
somehow understandable, we must 
constantly ask ourselves whether it is 
accompanying rational analysis or tak-
ing the place of it. Is there an obiective 
and compelling justification for bomb-
ing Afghanistan (and its public appeal 
is only incidental)? Or, was thi s spec-
tacular military action undertaken , ar 
least in part, because of irs symbolic 
value? 

It is a terrible notion that Afgnanl 
civilians, already tried by more than 20 
years of wars and brutal dictatorshIp , 
are sacrificing their lives on the altar of 
public opinion, but, alas, it is not a far-
fetched scenario. 

But - and this is another quirk of the 
apres-guerre - the same instantaneous 
world news that requires spectacular 
actions against an enemy, any enctll)·, also 
plays on the other side. Every action of 
the western coalition will be observed 
from the two points of view, and every 
civilian suffering will be reported in the 
most minute details. 

A consequence of the media 's pres-
ence is that, in the apres-guerre, a mod -
ern country must show the world that il 
is trying to kill as few people as possible 
or (since this is more a pious desire than 
a realizable objective) to keep the casu-
alties as far away from the ca meras as 
possible. This is opposed to traditional 
war, where one tries to kill as many ene-
mies as possible. 

The administration took great care in 
pointing out that, together with the 
bombs, airplanes would drop food on the 
Mghani refugees - the apres-guerre is, 
at its bottom, as dirty an affair as the old 
fashioned war, but it is important to sur-
round it with all the paraphernalia thaI 
are commonly associated with 
Hollywood movies: Only the bad guys 
kill the innocents.

By MAnHEW E, CROW 
Contributing Writer 

Many say that in the new mil-
lennium, the next frontier in civil 
rights issues will be acceptance and 
full inclusion of homosexuals in 
our society. Seeing as how there 
are gay and lesbian student org.mi-
zations at many college campuses 
in America. and thar there are 
homosexual Chief Executive 
Officers scattered throughout the 
corporate sector, I would have to 
disagree. 

Don't ger me wrong, I hope and 
pray that our society can . move 
toward a fully inclusive view of 

hot116se~uals , but the way I see it, 
the next great frontier in civil 
nghrs lies hidden where very few 
people bother to look. I am talking

another purpose: The administra-
tion realizes that the political cap-
ital constituted by the interna-
tional outrage after the events of 
Sept. II will rapidly evaporate as 
civilian casua lties are reported, 
especially in countries like 
Pakistan, where the sentiment of 
identitlcation with the Afghani 
people is stronger. 

The bOl'l1bing has already 
caused confirmed civilian casual -
ties : four U.N. workers on a mis-
sion to remove land mines, and we 
can expect more.

that the administration can muster 
to keep the frail network support-
ing the action together. .

stage. This is a group that has no 
powerful voice because it cannot 
speak in the normal channels of 
mass communication in our soci-
ety. Indeed, the mentally disabled 
remain the most common victims 
of prejudice and misunderstanding 
because the advancement of their 
cause depends primarily upon the 
willingness of others to help them. 

The journey to the present for 
the mentally disabled community 
has been horrible compared to that 
of any other ethnic or religious 
group thal has suffered extreme 
persecution. In the middle ages, 
people with obvious disabilities 
were burned at the stake because 
they were seen as inherently evil. 
In many countries today, children 
born wirh disorders such as 
Down's Syndrome are killed 
because they are not viewed as pro-
ductive members of society. 
During the Reagan administration, 

opponents of Bush, such as 
myself. were surprised by the 
restraint, the rationality and the 
diplomatic capacity of this admin-
istration. Now they have 
embarked on an operation that 

Now [the Bush 
administration] have

'disastrous spiral of 

hate and terror. 

could constitute a positive step in 
the struggle against terrorism, or 
that could lead to a disastrous spi-
ral of hate and terror. 

This is a move without return , 

a ranking official in the 
Deparnnent of Education publicly 
put forth the idea that people with 
disabilities are the way they are 
because God is punishing them for 
their evil acts in a past life. 

Even today. in theological cir-
cles of the religious fundamentalist 
movement, the mentally disabled, 
along with those who have AIDS 
or who died in the terrorist attacks 
in ew York, are considered exam-
ples of God's wrath visited upon 
the sinful. 

More hurtful than the history of 
fear and hatred toward these peo-
ple is the present situation in which 
many of them live. My sister has 
Down's Syndrome, and this has led 
me to volunteer for Special 
Olympics and work for Access 
Leisure, a program that provides 
recreation for disabled people. She

and the administration knows 
very well that it will have to face 
many consequences: the pledge of 
the terrorists to bring more ter-
ror, the growing instability of 
crucial Arab countries, increasing 
indecisiveness among the allies 
and, most important, the Israeli 
time bomb. 

Never like today could a 
wrong move by the Israeli gov-
ernment aggravate the situation, 
and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon 
has shown a preoccupying ten-
dency toward thoughtless action. 
Bush knows this very well, and in 
the last few weeks he has been 
tougher with the Israeli govern-
ment than any administration in 
the recent past . 

Behind all these considerations, 
however, is the simple truth that in 
the apres-guerre. as in war, the 
civilians will pay a terrible price, 
either in buildings destroyed by the 
blind hate of terrorists, crying their 
farewells into cellular phones or in 
nights of darkness and terror in 
Kabul, where nobody can hear

Previews give away a lot more

Nothing ruins a great movie more than knowing

By MATTHEW LEPORI 
Contributing Writer 

About a year and a half ago, 1 
was sitting in a movie theater 
waiting for a movie to start. The 
previews began and a trailer for 
the upco:ning movie "Cast Away" 
began showing. 

The trai ler showed Tom 
Ibnks maroo ned on a desert 
island after a crash and a few 
clips of him on the island as he 
became more grizzly and savage 
with each scene . And then they 
did it - they ruined the movie. 
How so? By showing another 
sce ne, in which you see him 
reunited with his wife. 

How this ruined the movie is 
simple: You know that he gets off 
the island I By viewing the trail er 
for the movie, all the uspense

zens in this country. 
However, now more than ever, 

we cannot be content with medi-
ocrity. We need to establish new 
training methods for special edu-

more teachers through this 
method, and we need communi-
cation in our society on the 
national level about how to fur-
ther include people with disabili -

The real battle for reformers 
of the special education and recre-

Congress, but in the minds of the 
American people. 

Members of the public Illust 
understand that people with men-
tal disabilities are fundamentally 
the same as the rest of us; the)' 
have favorite bands and favome 
foods, they like to wear fashion-
able clothes like the rest of us, and 
they enjoy the same quali ties of 
life thatconnect us as human 
beings. They laugh, they cry and, 
as is true with all people, the most 
important thing in their li\'es is 
friendship. 

It is a great national tragedy 
that our society often denies the 
basic necessity of friendship to its 
disabled citizens through lack of 
attention and outright shunning. 
Each and every one of us must 
take an active role in reaching alit 
to the marginalized in order to 
bring them in from the cold . 

A Jesuit priest once told me 
that the state of a society can be 
judged by the condition of that 
society's poor, oppressed and oth-
erwise marginalized citizens. If 
this is true, and I believe it is, then 
we as a society have miles to go 
before we sleep on the issue of 
rights for the disabled.

CSULB investigates hazing 
Member of Hispanic fraternity allegedly beaten 

LONG BEACH, Calif. - Last 
year Gilbert Lopez, a 21-year-old 
junior business major, decided to 
rush a fraternity at California State 
University Long Beach. Two 
friends from high school were 
members of Delta Sigma Chi, a co-
ed Hispanic fraternity, and Lopez 
sa id he felt the fraternity suited him 
best. But while Lopez was looking 
for brotherhood and friendship, he 
found only pam and humiliation. 

Lopez said Delta Sigma Chi 
member Emiliano Torres, a senior 
theater maior, invited him to his 
off-ca mpus apartment one night 
Illst April. w,hile he was there. 
Lopez said, he was hazed. 

llazing usually is justified by 
members of fraternities and sorori-
ties as a means of promoting broth-
erhood and sisterhood among 

We make 

tedge~, as they build bond! while 
supporting each other through the 
hazing, 

Of the three students who 
pledged Delta Sigma Chi that 
semester, Lopez was the only male. 
lie also was the only pledge present 
on the night of the hazing incident. 

He said he didn 't undersr.1nd 
what lbrres was try1ng to accom-
plish with the excessive hazing. 

"What makes me want to be 
friends with you after you do some-
thing like that?" Lopez asked. 

After that night, Lopez said, he 
reported the incident to university 
police and university administra-
tibn, but nothing happened. He 
said the police report was filed as 
assault with a deadly weapon, a 
charge punishable by dismissal 
from the university. 

a good case 
for 

law school 

"[The fraternity members] got 
really mad when I told the univer-
sity police and my parents. They 
wanted to keep it among them-
selves," Lopez said. 

Frustrated by the lack of action 
by police and university administra-
tors, Lopez wrote a letter appearing 
in the Lqng Beacb Union. Nearly all 
copies of the Union containing the 
letter were stolen from their racks 
just days after distribution. Soon 
after his letter was published, school 
administrators began to take action, 
Lopez said. 

Torres declined ro comment .. 
Delta Sigma Chi President 

Louie Rodiles emphasized that the 
alleged incident would be in no way 
condoned by the fra ternity.

Anti-war demonstrators, military 
supporters clash at UC Berkeley 
Protesters clash in campus' Sproul Plaza 

BERKELEY, Calif. - Tension between 
anti-war demonstrators and supporters of 
military ac tion marked Monday's anti -war 
rally on the UC Berkeley campus, where 
hund reds of demonstra tors g athered in 
response to the bombing of Afghanistan. 

Late in the afternoon, about 300 demon-
strato rs clogged the entrance to the down-
rown Berkeley BART statio n , rall ying 
agai nst the war. 

T he protests, planned by anti-war groups 
to occur one day after the first U .S. military 
actio n, began when about 600 supporters 
and dissenters o f the mil itary campaign 
descended on Sproul Plaza at noon. 

~urh J enni so n , spokesperso n for the 
Berkeley Stop the War Coalition, which 
organized the ca mpus protest , said the goa l 
of the prote tS was to increase the promi-
nen e of the anti -war movement. 

" It is important that we nor be seen as the 
Illll10rity and that Berkeley be the voice of 
reason," J ennison said . 

Speaking to the crowd on Sproul Plaza , 
Sneha l hingavi, a UC Berkeley graduate 
student, said war crea tes a clima te of hatred 
and racism. H e decried the senselessness of 
attacking "phantoms" in Afghanistan. 

" [Bombing] is the worst thing you can do 
to perhaps the poorest country in the world," 
Shingavi said. 

Amid signs decla ring "No War" and 
" top the Bombing in Afghanistan," sup-
porters of the military action countered the 
anti -war rall y With their own signs, flags and 
cheers. 

Rushing the steps of Sproul I-lall , the sup-
porters of military action began to drown out 
speakers, chanting ·'U .S.A.'" and "Hey, hey! 
110, ho! T he Ta liban has got to go!" 

Rally organizers urged the supporters of 
military action to respect the speakers and 
began to counter-cheer. 

T he cord of the megaphone carried by a 
supporter of military action was cut, an act 
that was immediately reported to police. 

Bret Manley, co-pre ident o f newly 
formed United Students for America, said 
the response from supporters of military 
action was growing on campus. 

"WI! are d isgusted by the anti-American 
sentiment on this campus," M anley said. 
"These people are standing out here protest-
ing the people that are fighting for them, and 
that 's ridiculous. We do more for countries 
in need than any other country in the 
world ." 

Anka Lee, president of the Cal Berkeley 
Democrats, said there was a need for biparti-
san support of the Bush Administration. 

"I'm a Democrat. But more impo rtantl y, 
I'm an Am erican," Lee said . "In times of 
national crisis, we should put o ur politi cal 
fee lings aside and support our coun try." 

Another anti-war rally was held at the 
downtown Berkeley BART station at 5 p.m. 
Many of the 300 demonstrators in atten-
dance later marched through downtown 
Berkeley. 

Berkeley City Councilmember Maudelle 
Shirek addressed a boisterous crowd display-
ing signs such as "The USA is still the 
worl d's greatest terrorist" and "Stop 
Bombing Afghanistan." 

"War has never solved anything," Shirek 
said . "We must negotiate and ta lk and not 
have war,"

Fire engulfs U. Massachusetts 
frat house; brothers left homeless 
Sorority members bring food, clothing, water 

AMHERST, Mass. - Twenty- three 
University of Massachusetts-Amherst Delta 
Upsilon fraternity brothers were forced from 
their home Oct. 5 when a fire consumed the 
three-story house. 

According to the Hampshire G.nttte, the 
blaze started when a candle in a first-floor 
room lit a mattress on fire and flames spread 
to the right half of the house. 

None of the residents, including the 
house dog, was injured . 

Because the brothers had covered fire 
detectors ' with plastic bags, the blaze had 
grown out of control by the time the 
Amherst, Mass. , Fire Department arrived, 
Amherst Fire Chief Keith Hoyle said. 

The Gflouttt reported the brothers might 
face criminal charges stemming from their 
obstruction of thl! lire detectors . 

By 3: I 5 p.m., nearly an hour after the fire 
bt!gan, the house "was pretty much totaled," 
Hoyle said. Although the building still 
stands, the first floor suffered smoke and 
water damage, the second and third floors 
were burned completely and the right half of 
the roof collapsed, he said. 

The Amherst Fire Department deployed 
35 firefighters to join four Northampton, 
Mass., fire fighters and UMass student vol -
unteers in combating the blaze. Four fire -
lighters suffered minor injuries and were 
later released after receiving treatment for 
dehydration, Hoyle said . 

Delta Upsilon Executive Director Abe 
C ross said a "housing corporation" of 
UMass Delta U psilon alumni owns the 
house, which the Amherst Assessor's office 
valued at $338,800. Cross said the house "is 
full y insured by a property program support-
ed by other Delta U psilon chapters, and we 
plan to build the best fraternity house possi -
ble on that property." 

Jason Hollis, treasurer of the housing 
corporation, sa id the new ho use will be 

r~ built .n two yea rs, but the brothers 

"can 't live in it until it's done." 
The university allowed the homeless 

brothers to stay at the Campus Center Hotel 
until Tuesday, when Dean of Students Jo-
Anne Vanin scheduled individual meetings 
with the students to discuss "future housing 
accommodations." Because the university 
doesn't "have a bed to be had," Vanin said local 
boarding houses such as dIe University Lodge 
would be contacted to negotiate possible living 
arrangements for the displaced students. 

Brothers also met with Director of Greek 
Affairs Mike Wiseman on Monday night to 
discuss future housing possibilities. A Delta 
Upsilon executive officer, Richard Graham, 
said Delta Chi, Phi Mu Delta and Phi Sigma 
Kappa fraternities offered to house the dis-
placed Delta Upsilon brothers for the 
remainder of the semester. Alpha Chi 
Omega, Iota Gamma Upsilon and Sigma 
Kappa sororities offered the brothers cloth-
ing, food and water, Graham said. 

Speaking over the squeals of fire sirens, 
Vanin gave the brothers a telephone number 
to call for emergency clothes and food 
vouchers. Vanin also promised the brothers 
her office would send letters to their teachers 
about the fire and asking for leniency during 
the upcoming weeks. She said she was start-
ing a "small loan fund " with which students 
could replace their textbooks. 

Like most of his brothers, E ri c Gibbons, 
a sophomore management major, lost nea rly 
a ll of his possessions in the fire, including a 
$1 ,000 stereo system, a $900 computer and 
$300 in textbooks . Altho ugh the house is 
insured , G ibbons might have to replace his 
possessions himself because he docs not have 
renter's insurance. 

"I thought my parents' insurance would 
cover me," he sa id. UBut because I live o ff-
campus I think I'm out of luck."

ARTS &' ENTERTAINMENT 

The 
celebration 

of local acts 
and bands is 

one of the 
• 

matn purpos-
es of the San 
Diego Music 

Awards 
Story by Claire J. ¥nette, 

Senior Staff Writer 

Photos by Tyler Huff 

clore the 11th anlual 
San Di ego Music 
Awards got undcrway 
Tuesday night, nomi-

nees and guests schmoozed around 
HUlllphrey's by the Bay, drinks in 
hand. The scats were stiJl largely 
empty as people clustered around 
the bar or local TV crews' cam-
eras, and the stage was host only to 
the occasional engineer adjusting 
mics and cords. 

But above the stage, two screens 
displayed a sequence of snippets of 
IOClll music history: music videos 
from San Diego artists. Some of 
them were quaint and amateurish, 
VHS gems filmed in high school 
gymnasiums or montages of readily 
rccoglllzable SO streetscapes. 
Wedged among these do-it-yourself 
classics were videos pulled straight 
from MTV, like Jewel's "Who WiJl 
Save Your Soul?," Blink-182s "All 
the SmaJl Things" and Sprung 
Monkey's "Get 'Em Dutra Here." 

TIlese videos' polish and pro-
duction and the fame of the arti ts 
they showcase were glitzy reminders 
of the essential conundrum of the 
San Dicgo scene. Namely, local acts 
always have their eyes on the prize 
of national rccogllition, but try to 

remain true to their SO vibe. 
The award ceremony played up 

the latter aspect, but it was clear that 
every musician and industry mem-
ber in the house was keenly aware of 
the distance fTom San Diego to Los 
Angeles. For ome, its a mere hop, 
skip and a jump. ror others, those 
200 might as well be 2,000. 

There is no shortage of 10Gli 
bands with the talent and drive to 
make it big. Tuesday night was a 
smorgasbord of musicians on the 
cusp. It was also an excuse for a 
tight -knit community of cross-pol-
linating, props-giving grou ps to 
chat each other up, jam the night 
away and show the love. 

Switch foot opened the show 
with their bright, Christian-influ-
enced pop. Their floating har-
monies mixed with just enough of 
an electronic kick to launch the 
night into high gear. 

One of those rare bands with 
success and humility, Switch foot 
seemed dazzled by the crowd . 

.. I t's good to be here," frontman 
Jon Foreman said bashfully. "This 
is probably the only chance we'll 
get to play Humphrey'S." 

His modesty was unjustified.

they were also honored with the 
Best Po p Album award for 
"Learning to Breathe." 

"This goes out to every artist 
thar's better than us that didn't 
win," Foreman said. 

While the category is traditional -
ly highly competitive as the San 
Diego pop scene is rich and active, 
S,vi tchfoot was a cut above, avoiding 
the darling musical cliches that often 
plague contemporary pop music. 

Artists throughout the night 
gave it lip to the less fornmate 
nominees in thell' categories . 
Candye Kane, who is based both in 
L.A. and S.D. and whose national 
visibility reli es upon her brassy per-
sonality and voice and her former 
work in the sex industry, was tearful 
in accepting thc Best Blue award. 

"There are so many other artists 
in this category who better repre-
sent San Diego music," she said. 

The classiest move of the night 
came from Ghoulspoon . Taking 
the prize for Best Hard Rock or 
Metal (and also, perhaps, stupidest 
band name of lhe year), they invit-
ed allthc other nominees onto the

Jay-Z 
The Blueprint 

Roc-A-Fella Records 

**** 
After li ve albums and 

mu,h success, J ay-Z the 
rapper has managed to do 
what some of the best 
artists do when they hit the 
top: improve. 

The album is short for 
ra p wi th only 13 songs, but 
it comes with little help: 
Eminelll raps on one song. 

"Bl ueprint" fea tures a 
few of the songs tha t com-
prise rap these days. "lzl.O" 
is the radio song - the one 
you'll hear at stOpl ights and 
clubs or chi rping from a 
third-stoty dorm window. 

"Gi rl , Girls, Gi rls" is 
remin iscent of Too Short 's 
"Freaky "f:1 Ies," on ly more 
modern . Jay-Z lim off the 
wOl1len he's been with, and 
though It must intcre t 
SOllle, it JUSt seems a bit 
tired Jt this point. 

There IS usually a song 
with Jil JllllOylllg chorus 
that get~ repeated often. In 

The SEAN CURRAN COMPA· 
NY will perform at Mandeville 
Auditorium. Curran has trained with 

this case, it 's "Hola Hovi to," 
in which til e final chorus is 
carried for a couple beats 
longer than necessaty. 

Any complaints are 
minuscule and minimal. 
The album has a consistent 
sound with deep beats -
at times with a metallic 
feel, at others, African. 

Jay-Z's lyrics are liquid, 
and although he occasional-
ly drops into superficiality 
- a seemingly inherent 
rapper quality - through-
out the album he dishes out 
lines that will either make 
you laugh or make you 
reach for the rewind button. 

Examples include "Don't 
only talk it, walk like 
itIFrom the bricks to the 
booth I could predict the 
furure like Cleo the Psychic" 
and "We can get paper 
longer than Pippen's arms." 

The notable songs are 
"Heart of the City" and 
"Renagade." The soulful 
chorus, Jay-Z's nows and 
the beat mix well enough to 
get "Heart of the City" into 
your head. And, despite 
any previous feelings about 
Eminem's content, his two 
verses on "Renagade" are 
packed with enough talent 
to raise eyebrows. 

It's one of those songs 
tha t allows rappers to throw 
out strings of words with-
out breaking, so the entire 
thi ng - beats and lyrics -
5cems like ' one. In that 
regard, It's like audio sex. 

This one' a must.

album 

Various Artists 
WWF Tough Enough 

Dreamworks 

** 
Finall y, an album for 

people who divide their 
time between watching 
M1V, WWF and lifting 
weights. Dreamworks put 
every heavy metal song 
that has been played on 
M1V in the last 12 months 
on "Tough Enough" and 
threw on "Smooth 
Criminal" to capture the 
attention of people who do 
not fall into the a foremen-
tioned niche market. 

What really makes this 
album interesting is that it 
features 13 different bands 
that span the hard rock 
genre and , well , they all 
sound the same. 

One thing that becomes 
glaringly apparent after lis-
tening to the entire album 
is that one screaming male 
voice is indistinguishable 
from another. 

Standout performances 
on the album come from 

Indie punk-rockers the SUI· 
CIDE MACHINES will be at 
'Canes Bar & Grill at 7 p.m. Their 

. 

reviews 
the Deftones with "Digital 
Bath." As the only ba llad 
on the album, "Digital 
Bath" offers a refreshing 
break from the otherwise 
entirely hard rock album 
with smooth driving per-
cussion and guitar that 
doesn't scream, but ye lls 
between whispers. 

Another breakaway 
from the too-hard rock 
album came from 
Halfcocked : in "Drive 
Away." The song sti ll fea-
tures hard guitar but is 
complemented by vocals 
from Sarah Reiticopp, 
whose voice nies effortless-
ly over the guitar. 
Halfcocked should be a 
great addition to what is 
otherwise a pretty weak 
female hard rock genre. 

Pressure 4-5 has an 
interestingly catchy offer-
ing, "Beat the World." Is 
this a bad song with really 
good parts or a good song 
with really bad parts? 
Ei ther way, it outdoes the 
majority of the album. 

The good thing about 
this album is that someone 
who is not into hard rock 
music can get almost every 
hard rock song they have 
heard on one album. The 
problem is that 10 songs 
on the album are indistin-
guishable from one anoth-
er even after multiple lis-
tens. 

Tough Enough? Maybe 
a little overdone and hard 
to swallow.

A Funk Odyssey 

Epic 

**** 
J amiroquai has definite-

ly been on an odyssey of 
funk. He appeared on the 
British club scene in 1992 
with funky house rhythms 
and many influences from 
'70s disco and soul . 

His debut album, 
"Emergency on Planet 
Earth," was released in 
1993 and exploded in the 
Uni ted Kingdom, hitting 
No. I and going platinum. 
"The Return of the Space 
Cowboy" also had great 
commercial success. 

"Travelling Without 
Moving" is the album 
Americans are most familiar 
with. "Virtual Insanity" was 
a huge success, receiving 
much radio and MTV play. 
Songs such as "Cosmic 
Girl" have been known to 
induce much ass-shaking. 

Jamiroquai's album, "A 
Funk Odyssey," will also 
get you started with some 

legend I * * * ** . * * * * . * * * . * * * 

feet tappin' that'll 
inevitably give way to let-
ting loose and dancing. 

The strings, guitars and 
vocals are definite nods to 
the disco era of the ' 70s, 
but the harder beats and a 
thick bassline give the 
album a modern house feel. 

The first three tracks 
are great dance songs, but 
then the album settles into 
a groovy Brazilia n tune 
called "Corner of the 
Earth." T he background 
vocals and the Latin guitar 
sound fit [Ogether to pro-
duce a very Antonio Carlos 
Jobim sound, complete 
with lyrics about nature. 

The nostalgic "Picture 
of My Life" is also reminis-
cent of some older bassa 
nova grooves and closes 
out the album in a bel uti -
ful, sunset-like fashion. 

Jamiroquai's funic roots 
shine in "Love Foolsophy" 
with a slap bass. He shifts 
to a darker sound with a 
fuzz bass and darker break-
beats in "Stop Don't Panic" 
and "Twen~ro One." 

Jamiroquai 's true talents 
lie in the funky house tunes 
found in "Feel So Good," 
"Little L" and "Main Vein ." 

His 1999 release, 
"Synkroni zed," failed to 
capture the magic of his 
previous albums and was 
met with some criticism. 
However, "A Funk 
Odyssey" shows that he is 
ready [0 get the dance 
noors groovin' once again.

Looking at Bob Dylan: 
the man of the hour 
Famous folk singer plays his tunes next 
Wednesday night at RIMAe Arena 
By SABRINA MORRIS 
Contributing Writer 

MOSt of us know Bob Dylan through black and wh ite 1960s camera footage as a 
harmoni ca-toting, bushy-ha ired 
youngster with a drone to his 
voice . We also know that he 
became one of the mo t dis tinc-
tive and poetic forces in the histo-
ry of American popular lI1usic. 

His 1963 debut album, "The 
Freewheelin ' Bob Dylan," con-
taining famous folk anthems such 
as "Blowin' in the Wind" and "A 
Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall ," broke 
new ground in the music industry. 

He then released his 1965 
album. "Bring It All Back Home," 
daring to introduce the electric 
guitar into the folk music realm. 
However, this transition from folk 
troubador to rock connoisseur 
was not a smooth one. Dylan was 
famously booed off stage when he 
performed with the Paul 
Butterfield Blues Band at the 1965 

ew Port Folk Festival. 
Dylan capped off the '60s with 

the album "Highway 6 1 
Revisi ted," whi ch included the 
fa mou "Like a Roll ing tOne." 

The 19705 proved more rurbulcl1l 
as he battl ed a fl olJndai ng mar-
riage and was involved in a near-
fatal motorcycle accident. 

After the crash, he re tired to 
his hOllle in Woodstock, . Y. and 
later released" :lshville Skyline," 
which was a far cry from the 
material he had released a decade 
earlie r. 

In the late 1970s, he tried 1m 
hand at film and re leased OIlC of 
the 1lI0st covered songs i II the h i~ ­
tory of rock 'n roll : "KJlockin ' On 
Heaven's Door." 

Then in 1983, he released 
"Infidels," co-produced by Dire 
Straits' frontman Mark Knopner, 
which proved to be a success with 
Kllopfler's graceful guitar tracks. 

In 1997, wh ile on tour in 
Europe to promote his albuill 
"Time Out of Mind ," he literally 
knocked on heaven's door. On the 
eve of the tour he was hospi tal ized 
with histoplasmosis, a potenti all y 
fatal infecti on that causes swell ing 
in the sac surroundi ng t h ~ heart . 

Luckily, he was able to contin-
ue touring after a few months and 
even pl ayed in Rome upon Pope

Jill' reach an information booth. 

\ \ 'hen their caravan does pull 
up, out walks the band. I apolobrize 
for my failed attempt as a tour 
gUide while they introduce them-
selves: ",\ lark," "Dino," "Gavin" 
,lIul "Drew," In a fashion very 
reminiscent of The Doors getting 
out of their airplane. 

Furmed in Los Gatos, Calif. , 

the Drcdg slory is not unlike that 
of mo~t bands. Four high school 
friends who grew up listening to 
the i\\i,tits and Sepulrura, among 
other things, loved plaY1l1g rogeth-
er and cvennla ll r gOt a record deal. 

Ilowcl'er, In li stening to 
Dredg's album, "Leitmotif," you 
11'111 realize they are not like every 
other band. \Nhen you pop in their 
Jlbum, you won't hear the same 
hard rork that has been coming out 
of your speakers for the last four 

year~ . I lints of Radiohead and Pink 
Floyd are there, but the best way to 
describe Dredg's sowld is to say 
that it sowlCls like Dredg. 

You should just get the album. 
\Nhen you open up the CD 

jacket you will not find pictures of 
the band or song lyrics, but rather 
the story of a person 's journey. 

"There's a character who trav-
els and [the album] follows his 
travels," Mark says. 

At the band's Web site, 
hrtp:llwww. dl·f(lg.com. you won't 
find publicity photos but rathe r a 
collection of Drew's paintings. 

A 

"Its just not really in our peo-
ple to go out and pose for pic-
tures," explains lead singer Cavill . 

Not since irvana has a band 
deviated from the tried-and-true 
formu la of the record industry 
publicity machine. Most musicians 
might tell you they're "all for the 
nonkie," but Dredg appears to real-
ly care about music as an art form. 

"We just like doing music -
we never really thought about the 
lifestyle as an influence to make 
music," said Dino. 

A recent Hollywood Rrporttr 
article pegged them as the new 
young guns of progressive rock -
a title they shun. 

"Labels are labels," Mark says. 
"I think the only reason that the 
label is put on there is because we 
don't follow normal structures." 

The independently recorded 
album "Leitmotif," which has been 
re-released by Interscope, certain-
ly did not follow the normal struc-
ture. Their upcoming major label 
re lease, due in early 2002, wi ll def-
initely be one to watch for.

The fundamental problem of

from the cheesy love story to giv-

Barry Levinson's latest flick is a hit-and-miss romantic come-dy that follows the story of 
two bank robbers and the woman 
they love as they make their way 
through Oregon and California, 
leaving a trail of money, stolen cars 
and an adoring public in their wake. 

"Bandits" follows Joe Blake 
(Bruce Willis) and Terry Collins 
(BiUy Bob Thornton) from a daring 
prison escape in Oregon all the way 
down the West Coast. The duo 
brings a unique approach to robbing 
banks that proves to be very efficient. 

The two fugitives quicldy recruit 
Harvey Pollard (Troy Garity), 
Blake's dimwitted cousin and an 
aspiring stuntrnan, as their wheel-
man. Things are going well for the 
crew until Collins has a run-in with 
Kate Wheeler (Cate Blanchett). 
Wheeler joins the team, adding con-
troversy ana an interesting love Story 
on the side. She must choose 
between Blake, the irresistible tough 
guy, and Collins, the sweet and sen-
sitive type. The movie's comedic ele-
ment kicks into overdrive as the two

REVIEW 

fight fdr her affection. 
Levinson is a proven director 

who has an Academy Award to 
prove it. He won the award for Best 
Director for "Rainman" in 1988. 
He is also no stranger 10 comedy. 
Levinson won critical acclaim with 
his direction of "Good Morning, 
Vietnam." His comedic style is 
unique in that it focuses on a sense 
of reality and relies on the humor of 
the actual moment instead of re ly-
ing on the aClOr overplaying it for 
laughs. T~at approach is followed 
in this movie and works very well. 

ThornlOn's performance as a 
neurotic hypochondriac is the sav-
ing grace of this movie. His 
comedic timing is very good; he 
saves a script that is slow at times 
and very predictable. It is a very 
solid role for him. 

Willis is simply average as the 
tough guy with a heart. He has his 
funny momen ts, but they are few in 
number. 

Blanchett does a nice job in her 
role as the bored housewife looking 
for adventure. She also has a few 
funny moments in the movie. 

Garity is surprisingly funny as 
the village idiot. His character is 
the only one who really shoots for 
overt comedy, with the exceptiun of 
a few scenes from Thornton. 

The cinematography is above 
average in this movie. There are 
some beautiful shots that capture 
some of the brilliant scenery in 
which the film was shot. Two-time 
Academy Award nominee Dante 
Spinoni ("L.A. Confidential," 
"The Insider") was in charge of the 
cinematography. 

"Bandits" IS a fun movie, but 
poorly written . It drags at times, 
but is saved by some solid perfor-
mances and definite comedy. For 
those simply looking for a good 
laugh and some relaxing entertain-
ment, this movie is one that should 
be on the list. However, if those 
looking for a solid plot and Oscar-
worthy performances should really 
look elsewhere.

Stoner: 
Chargers are one of the 
biggest surprises in the NFL 
Continued from page 20 

been an effective leader on the field 
and in the clubhouse, something 
which the hargers have nor had 
since the good old days - before 
somebody named Ryan Leaf came 
wwwn. 

The Charger; ' defense, the one 
l'OnSrJllt during the Leaf era -
whtch is when their offense wa, so 
bad It worc our its own defense by 
repeatedly giving the ball away - is 
as capable as ever, led of course by 
Junior Seau. 

Cornerback Ryan McNeil has 
also been sensa tional for San 
Diego's defense, logging five inter-
ceptions in his first three games. 
That's more than he had in the P,ISt 
lhree vears combll1ed. 

Ca'n the Chargers do the i mpos-
sible and make the playoffs after 
flirting with the NFL's first 0- 16 
season ever last year? 

year and is 2-2 . 

lyon I.'A!!w/GuorcfKJn 

Bumping around: Two UCSD students 
compete in FaIiBaIl, a volleyball league 
separated by the five colleges. Top teams from 
each college Will compete in the finals. 

But these are the teams the 
Chargers are supposed to beat and 
victories over the pond scum of 
the FL cannot provide much 
consolation . Looking at the bright 
side, at least the Chargers arr 
beating the tea ms they should 
beat. 

But last Sunday, in their first 
game against a decem tcam, the 
Chargers lost to Cleveland, 20- 16. 
While the Browns have surprised 
everyone this year by jumping out 
to 3-1, they are not among the 

FL elite. 
So if the Chargers cannot beat 

the Browns, what chance do they 
have against the Raiders or the 
Broncos, the two teams tied with 
the Chargers atop the AFC West? 
The Chargers have two games 
against each team and the way San 
Diego is playing right now, I don't 
believe they are good enough to 
beat either team. 

Gwynn: 
One of baseball's greatest 
hitters calls it quits 
Continued from page 20 

The list stretches on and on: IS 
AlI- tar games, a .3 71 career aver-
age in the World Series, eight fi ve-
hit games and one six-hit game. 
But one of the most impressive sta-
tistics is that Gwynn only struck 
out t11ree times in a game OlICt . He 
never struck out four times in a 
game. 

He was perhaps the greatest 
contact hiner of all time. I once 
watched an interview in which the 
reporter asked him what type of 
pitch the pitcher threw 10 him . 
Gwynn said that he never knows 
what the pitcher throws, but that 
he JUSt sees the ball and reacts. 

He coi ned the term "5.5 hole," 
which is the spot between the third 
baseman and the shortstop where 
he loved to hit the ball . 

Looking at him, one wouldn 't 
believe that he is an athlete . 
Gwynn is definitely on the portly 
side and has been lambasted in the 
past by critics for his weight. YCt he 
never let it bother him and always 

SPORTS 19 

was able to joke about It. That he 
has five Gold Gloves proves tim 
he was more than ,apabl.: in thc 
outfield. 

Gwynn became so consis t<:lllly 
good that he was expected to he 
good all the time. I [is naltle 11'3 , 
always there among the leaders, yct 
he was always bypassed hy Ihe 
media and fans for flashier pl a )'cr~ 
playing for better teams. 

ow he is gone, and ,\I ,I lor

Going for it: UCSD competes in a water polo game from last year. The team ~nished second in the 2000 NCAA 
Championships. This year, the team hopes to continue its success with a solid class of returners and new recruits. 

Even though I seriously doubt it 
will happen, I invite the Chargers 
to prove me wrong.

Recent trip to DC Davis proves

Several members of the UCSD 
men's tennis team were in action 
last weekend at the 2001 
Intercollegiate Tennis Association 
West Region Tennis 
Championships, which were held at 
UC Davis last Thursday and Friday. 

The Tritons' Michael Meye;, 
who was the fourth seed of the 
event, had an impressive run in the 
men 's singles championship. He 
cruised through the first three 
rounds of the event before finally 
falling 6-3, 6-2 to Jan Krejci, the 
tournament's top seed out of BYU-
Hawaii, in the semifinals. Krejci 
went on to take the singles title. 

Meyer, a sophomore, was also a 
part of the No. 3-ranked doubles 
team in the tournament that went 
tp the semifinals. Meyer was paired 

with freshman Sameer Chopra. 
The duo defeated teams from 
California State University Los 
Angeles and UC Davis before 
falling in the semifinals. 

Meyer and Chopra were ousted 
from the tournament by UC Davis' 
Yaro Vinogradsky and Greg Lee, 
who were the No. 2 seeds in the 
tournament. The team from 
UCSD fell by a score of 8-4. 

Individuall y, UCSD's Bryan 
Swan made the quarterfinals, while 
Blake Wilson-Hayden, Emil 
Novak, Jeff Wilson, Chopra and 
Scan Higginbotham were all elimi-
nated in the third round of the 
tournament. Everett Schroeter 
only gOt to the second round 
before he was defeated. 

In the doubles bracket, Swatt 
and Wilson, along with the team of 
Novalc and Schroeter, were elimi-
nated in the quarterfinals. , 

A huge upset for waterpolo 
Tritons dispatch Trojans in dominating fashion

The UCSD men's water polo 
team scored one of the biggest 
upsets of the year with a 7-3 
pounding of second-ranked 
University of Southern California 
on Sunday afternoon at 
McDonald's Swim Stadium in Los 
Angeles. 

This was an important win for 
the Tritons. 

"This win was big for us," 
UCSD head coach Denny Harper 
said. "It was only our second real-
ly tough game of the year, the Ilrst 
being Saturday'S game against 
Pepperdine, which is ranked No. 
4. Prior to this, we had only 
played teams ranked below us, so 
it was getting tough for us. We 
were ready to see how we'd do 
against the tough competition. 
We definitely responded." 

The Tritons, who are currently 
ranked nimh in the nation with an 
11 - 1 record, handed the mighty 
Trojans their third consecutive 
loss. It was the second-straight 
time that UCSD had defeated 
USC, dating back to the 9-8 victo-
ry in the 2000 National Collegiate 

Athletic Association Champion-
ships in Malibu, Calif. 

"We seem to have a thing 
going with the Trojans," Harper 
said. 

The Trojans, who fell to 4-3 
for the year, were knocked on 
their backs early by the relentless 
Tri ton attack. 

UCSD took the early lead after 
Brett Allan connected on a penal-
ty shot at the 3: 10 mark. That lead 
was increased on a power-play 
goal from Kellan Hori three min-
utes later. UCSD's Predrag 
Damjanov scored on a back-hand-
ed goa l to pull the Trojans to with-
in one at the close of the first peri-
od of play. 

The Tritons scored three 
unanswered goals to begin the 
second period and took complete 
control of the match. Two of the 
goals came on power plays. USC's 
Daniel Lomay scored a goal to 
close the second period, but the 
damage had already been done. 
UCSD took a commanding 5-2 
lead into the final period. 

Lomay added another goal for 
the Trojans, but the Tritons added 
a pair in the final period to put the 
game away. 

Lance Onken was solid in goal 
for UCSD, stopping 10 shots en 
route to the victory. USC's 
Bozidar Damjanovic could only 
manage seven saves that after-
noon. 

Leading the offensive attack for 
the Tritons was Jonathan Samuels, 
who scored three goals for the hat 
trick. Allan, Hori, Clark Peterson 
and Paul Morachall each had a goal 
in the win. 

"We just went out there and ' 
played our game," Harper said. 
"Our defense was especially great. 
They had us a man down ntllc 
times, but we held them scorcl e~5 
during those stretches. We were 
four out of six in those situations. 
That was the gamc ri r-ht there." 

UCSD will next be in action at 
the 2001 Nor-Cal Tournament 
this weekend at Stanford 
University. The lhtons will take 
on UC Irvine in the openi ng game 
on Saturday. 

"[The game ag3 111St UC IrvlllcJ 
is going to be a huge gamc for u, ," 
Harper sa id . " If we win , then we 
will get to play the rop teams. If 
we lose, we will be back to playing 
lower teams, which won't help us 
to get any better."

Bel ieve it or not, the UCSD 
men's soccer team is one of the 
hottest teams in the nation right 
now. 

The Tritons shut out 
California State University 
Stanislaus 3-0 Sunday afternoon 
at Warrior Soccer Field. 

The victo ry was UCSD's 
fourth in its last five games after 
starting the season a disappoint-
ing 1-7 . The turnaround began 
after a tough 1-0 loss to league 
powerhouse Cal State 
Dominguez Hills that gave the 
Tritons confidence. Since then , 
the team's only loss was the 4-0 
defeat at the hands of league rival 
Cal ta te Bakersfield. 

With the victory, the Tritons 
again come to within one game 
of .500 in California Collegiate 
Athletic Association play at 5-6. 
T he team is 5-8 overall. The 
10;5 drops the Warriors to 2 -7 in 
th e California Coll egiate 
Athl eti c Association and 3 - II

THE UCSD GUARDIAN PORTS 20 

By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Sports Editor 

On Oct. 7, 2001, 'lony Gwynn left baseball 
the same way he participated in it during his 20 
years in the majors: I Je suited up, took the field 
and quietly went about his business, 

then went straight to the Padres and began his 
1 lall of Fame career. Other than Gwynn, only 
five other ational Leaguers have played on 
one team for 20 years. 

Gwynn was O-for-I in his final game as a big 
league hiner. A quiet grounder to short ended 
the career of one of baseball's most prolific hit-
ters . Through it all, lony handled it with the 
same class that he had throughout his brilliant 
career in the big leagues. 

He defined the hackneyed terms "class act," 
"idol" and "superstar" better than any other 
current baseball player. During the long 
stretches when the Padres had no chance of 
making the World Series or even Ule playoffs, 
Gwynn had plenty of opportunity and motive 
to leave for more money or a better shot at a 
championship. He chose to remain in his 
beloved San Diego. 

Sure, there was a big ceremony. Sure, he 
hugged his teammates after his last at-bat and 
gave a speech after the game, but his day was 
overshadowed by Bonds' 73 rd home run, Rickey 
Henderson's 3,000th hit, and Cal Ripken's 
retirement. 

Even at the end of his playing career, 
Gwynn isn't packing any bags. In a press con-
ference Sept. 20. he confirmed that he will 
replace his old coach at SDSU, Jim Dietz. 
Gwynn is only the fourth baseball coach in 
SDSU history. 

The most impressive thing about his career 
had nothing to do with hits, batting titles or A11-
Star appearances. It was his stability. In a sport-
ing era characterized by discontinuity and 
change - where players change teams annually 
in search of more money or better opportunity 
- Gwynn has not only been on the same team 
for 20 years, he has been in the same town his 
whole life. 

After graduating high school in San Diego, 
Gwynn attended San Diego State University 
and set records in baseball and basketball. He 

And what a coach he'll make. He is the 
Padres' career leader in games, batting ave rage, 
hits, runs, doubles, triples, RBis and - surpris-
ingly enough - stolen bases. He racked up over 
3,000 hits. won eight batting titles and is the 
only person to have four batting titles in two dif-
ferent decades. He batted over JOO for 18 con-
secutive seasons. In his 20-year career, he hit 
safely in over 75 percent of the games he played 
in. 

Women survive a big 
scare in CCAA action 
Tritons score a late goal to get 
past a tough conference opponent 
By JOSH CROUSE 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD women's socc~r 
team squeaked past California 
State University Stanislaus 2-1 in 
a California Collegiate Athletic 
Association match Sunday after-
noon in Turlock. 

This was an especially sweet 
victory for the Tritons because 
they snapped the Warriors' four-
game home winning streak. 

"This was, a big road win for 
us." UCSD head coach Brian 
McManus said. "[CSUS is) a very 
tough team. They are young, 
physical and fast. They played us 
very tough and with a lot of con-
fidence ." 

The Tritons, who upped their 
record to 9-1 in the CCM and 
11 - 1 overall, had luck on their 
side when a CSUS defender 
deflected a crossing pass into the 
net to give UCSD the early lead. 

The game was knotted at one 
just II minutes into the second 
half when Kara Maloney broke 
free and scored a goal off a Sela 

uarez assist. The tying goal 
came JUSt after Warrior defender 

Kerri Frankel yelled. "We never 
lose at home," from CSUS's 
backfield. 

The Warriors, who fell to 4-4-
I in the CCM and 7-6-1 overall, 
hung tough for most of the second 
half, but were simply outplayed by 
the Tritons late in the game. 

"We dominated the last 15 
minutes of the game." McManus 
said. "We had seven or eight cor-
ners in the last \0 or 12 minutes. 
The ball was constantly down in 
[CSUS's) side of the field. We 
just couldn't take advantage and 
put one away." 

UCSD finally broke through 
with just under a minute-and-a-
half left to play when Kristen 
Conahan scored on a cross pass. 
The ball rolled off goalkeeper 
Michelle Balzouman's hands to 
give the Tritons the narrow victo-
ty. 

Kami Poma made three saves 
for UCSD in the win . Kara 
Keene and Balzouman had two 
saves apiece for CSUS. 

The Tritons will be back in 
action Saturday when they host 
Western Washington University. 
Kickoff is scheduled for I p.m.
