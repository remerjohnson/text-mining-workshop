Eight chiefs of staff for the 
administrations of Presidents Eisenhower

unprecedented forum on the inner 
workings of the White House, at Mandell 
Weiss Theatre , Friday, Jan. 17. 

Andrew Goodpaster, Theodore Sorenson, 
Harry McPherson, Alexander Haig, H.R. 
Haldeman, Donald Rumsfeld, Richard 
Cheney, and Jack Watson will discuss the 
role of chief of staff during major political 
cnses such as the Bay of Pigs, Watergate, 
and the Iranian hostage situation, 
according to the UCSD Public Information 
Office. 

Michael Parrish , UCSD history professor, 
was present when the idea of such a forum 
was conceived. UCLA was once interested 
in inviting H.R. Haldeman to a seminar on 
the presidency, Parrish said. "Other faculty

majors has also droFped off. 
About 10 percent 0 the 
freshmen of 1985 said they plan

12 percem in 1982. Otherwise 
the trends of recem years 
continued with this year's class,

Univers ity Advisory Commi ttee 
on Investor ResponsibilIty 
(UAClR) held in Los Angeles last 
week 

The Dunn and Bradstreet 
Corporation and Baker 
International are the two 
companies who have signed the 
pact, which states that 
corporations doing business in 
South Africa uphold principles of 
equal treatment and affirmative 
action . 

The UACIR is a committee 
that was established by the 
Board of Regents of the 
University of Cahfornia in 
response to controversy that 
arose about UC investments in 
American companics in South 
Africa. 

The purpose of the committee 
is to review. on a case-by-case 
basis, the quality of corporate 
Citizenship of the companies 
\vith whom the University holds 
stock. It is the re ponslbllity of 
the UACIR to ensure that those 
companies are signitories in 
good standing of the Sullivan 
prinCiples or that they adhere to 
an equivalent standard of good 
corporate Citizenship in that 
country. 

In November the UAClR froze 
further investments in the Naleo 
Chemical Company. aleo failed 
to comply with the standards of 
the Sullivan Principles. The 
UACIR apprised NaJco of a 
revision of its policies and 
encouraged the company to 
improve its citizenship 
standings. So far, aleo's 
position on divestment is unclear 
and that of the UC Regents' is 
also uncertain .

Body snatchers strike 
UCSD medical center 
By MICHELLE-SHARI MOSKOWITZ 

T WO FORMER employees of the UCSD Medical Center, accused of iUegally 
removing and marketing bodies 
and body pans, are currently 
under investigation by state and 
local authorities. 

Jonathan L Mclntyre and 
Michael J. Sullivan planned to set 
up a private tissue bank, while 
employed at the medical center 
in Hillcrest , to harvest bone and 
tissue as a form of competition 
for the center and a means of 
personal profit, accordi ng to 
police reports . 

The district attorney's office is 
investigating claims by UCSD 
that the tissue bank removed 
bone tissue from cadavers 
without the permission of UCSD 
or the relatives of the deceased . 

The San Diego Tissue Bank 
and Alva Professional Services 
diverted over $17,000 worth of 
bodies and body pans over a 
period of six months, according 
to San Diego police officer Jones. 
Jones alleges that the ex-
employees of the center 
commited the crimes of grand 
theft and illegal marketing of 
hnnv r i <;sue. 

Leroy Mclnryre was the tissue 
bank coordinalOr at the UCSD 
Skin Bank for nine years. 
Michael Sullivan worked as a 
skin technician for one year. 
Both men resigned on May 10, 
1985, one month after the state 
approved their privately owned 
tissue bank , according to the 
Medical Center officials. 

In April 1985 Mclntyre was 
given approval by the state to 
open a tissue and bone bank. 

The San Diego Regional Tissue 
Bank was operated by Mcintyre, 
Sullivan and Lee Dyer, who was 
then owner of Alva Professional. 
Dyer told police that in January 
he was approached by Mcintyre 
who said th'l-t he "wanted to set 
up a tissue bank," 

The need had arisen from an

excess of bodies being donated 
to the center, and therefore a 
private bank was needed, he 
said . 

Dyer alleges that he had no 
idea that Mclntyre was not yet 
approved by the state and that 
the harvesting was illegal. "I 
thought that harvesting would 

o~ly be done on the bodies that 
the university did not want. And 
that idea made sense to me , 
even though the university 
obviously doesn 't want 
competition . " 

Police officials said Mclntyre 
and Sullivan broke two laws. 
Number 7051 of the Health and 
Safety Code states that It IS illegal 
for anybody to "market or sell 
body tissue" without the 
authori ty lO do so The men are 
also guilty of Grand Theft 
number 487 of the Caltfornta 
Penal Code, the offIcers said. 

Once the organ bank received 
state approval, it was no longer 
illegal to market body parts 

"There is no established 
protocol of how you come by the 
tissue. If you can con vi nce the 
public that you are capable of 
receiving these gifts and you are 
approved by the state to do this 
then you can do it. It is that 
simple," Jones saId . 

The d istrict at(Qrney's office is 
now awaiting a complete account 
from the police. It is there that it 
Will be decided whether to issue 
a complaint charging these 
people with theft and illegal 
marketing of the bodies, or 
dismiss the case because there is 
not enough Information to 
prosecute. 

Dyer has informed the police 
department that he is seeking 
approval to open up his own 
tissue bank, Jones said. 

Dyer's bank, the Organ 
Donor's Center, will be the third 
in this county, in addition (Q 
UCSD's and the San Diego 
Regional Tissue Bank. ~

AS passes new 
media initiative 

By CHARMAIN HARA VEY and CHRISTINE HUEBER. Stuff 
Writers 

The A.S. passed 
Communications Commissioner 
Michael Fahlbusch's new 
Alternative Media budget 
proposal by an overwhelming 
majomy in last night's council 
meeting. 

"The proposal will help to 
equalize the funding to each 
paper," Fahlbusch said . "I'm 
trying to be concerned with all 
the papers." 

The proposal affects all the 
alternative media, and proVides 
for equal fund i ng set at a level to 
cove r production COSts for six 
issues per year, for each 
newspaper. 

The controversial proposal 
passed in a roll-call vote , 19-2, 
with Warren College Senator 
John Riley and Sal Veas 
opposing. 

Riley submitted a proposal for 
the formation of an ad hoc 
subcommittee which will 
investigate funding options and 
survey readership , in order to 
form a referendum to be put on 
the spring ballot. 

The subcommittee will include 
one chair appointed by A.S. 
President Mary Rose Alexander, 
one representative from the 
Media Board , twO A.S. Council 
members, and one student at 
large. 

The original proposa l included 
two representatives from th e 

alternative media. An 
amendment proposed by 
Alexander removed these two. 

There was strong reaction by 
representatives of Voz Fronteriza 
and the new indicator, who 
collectively walked out after close 
to two hours of discussion. 

"Thc subcommittee has too 
many representatives from the 
A.S.," said Bertha Ochoa of Vaz 
Franleriza. 

Riley opposed Alexander's 
changes. "It 's gOt to be more 
diverse ," he said . There needs to 
be a "cross-section" of 
representatlves to be more 
"cquitable and fair ," Riley said . 

"Most studcnts don't care or 
don't know," said Jill Lifschtz, 
chair of the AS Finance 
Subcommittee. "No alternative 
proposals have been submitted ," 
said Lifschiz. "The universiry 
students shouldn't be totally 
supporting the alternative 
media," she said. 

External Arfairs Vice-President 
Greg Arnold called campus 
security immediately before the 
vote on Fahlbusch's proposal. A 
UCSD alumnus associated with 
the new indicator and Alumni 
Against Apartheid , Monty Reed 
Kroopkin , said , "Sleg heil." 
Fahlbusch rose suddenly from 
his scat and was adVised by Muir 
Senator Greg MacCrone not to 
react. ~

McGill 'nauseates' protestors 
Angry protestors attacked 

the words and actions of 
lormer UCSD chancellor 
William McGill in a lecture 
Tuesday, titled after his book, 
The Year of the Monkey. 

McGill discussed the era of 
student protests during the 
late 1960s and some of the 
resulting administrative 
actions. Some of the protestors 
accused him of. both then and 
now, "depoliti clzing" the 
issues of students' freedom of 
speech and the Vietnam war. 

·Yes, I depo\iticized them ," 
he said, "because at the time I 
didn't look at the issues as 
political. If you saw me as a 
tool for the elite (administra-
tion) , I didn't look at it that 
way," he said. 

"You nauseate me. You are a 
war criminal. You should be 
imprisoned ," shouted one 
irate protestor, who claimed 

he was an entering student in 
1970, during the peak of the 
Vietnam protests. The only 
reason McGill was invited to 
speak was because of the 
nght-wmg sentiments of the 
current A.S., the protestor said . 

Prote stors from the 
Coa lrtion for a Free South 
Arnca handed out leaflets 
denounCing McGi ll and 
claiming hIS book (about the 
era) clouds the histOrical truth. 

Slogans on protestors' signs 
saId "Don't let McGill make a 
monkey out of you ," and "No 
more doublespeak, no more 
lies: 

The discussion focused on 
the appropriate role of a 
university as a teaching 
Institution with respect to any 
political movement. One 
female protestor said it was "a 
farce" that an institution of 
higher education could or 

should be neutral. 
" In my opinion the 

university is not an 
appropriate place for the 
creat ion of a politi ca l 
movement . .. if you use force 
(to achieve those political 
goals) , I Will fight you ," said 
McGill . Regarding his role 
when he was Chancellor, he 
said, "Ileamed how to achieve 
control, not with political 
motivation , but because it was 
what I saw as my duty." 

The main difference 
between the protests now and 
m 1968 is the lack of 
"sustained emotional arousal" 
tooay, McGill said . 

"I've dealt with experts 
for twenty years, and you 
people are amateurs ," he said, 
after repeated shouted 
accusatlons by the protestors.

Regents vote on Pacific school The school, which Governor Deukmejian slated $480,000 in 
his proposed state budget, hopes 
to begin admitting its first 
graduate students in the fall of 
1987 and grow to full strength of 
400 students before 1993. The 
Pacific region to be studied runs 
from the southernmost tip of 
Latin America, northward across 
the United States and Canada, 
down through the Soviet Union. 
Japan , China and the other 
nallons of Ease and Southeast 
Asia, Includmg Australia . 

The UC Regents will hold the 
final vote of approval on UCSO's 
proposed Graduate School of 
International Relations and 
Pacific Studies during their 
meeting at UC San Francisco

The chiefs' domina nce of ideology 
While attending a very bitter dis ussion berween ex-UCSD Chancellor 

William Mcgill (1968-1970), and about 10 provocateurs in the audience 
who seemed to be bent on destroying his self-proclaimed reputation as 
being "essentially a non-political psychologist," we became quite taken 
with what appeared to be a metaphorical prizefight. The contestants 
who stalked each other across the ring, however, did not exactly take it 
upon themselves to be human , but rather chose to distinguish 
themselves as purveyors of a "true hiStory." On the one end of the 
spectrum there sat Mcgill, who thinks himself to be messianic (a man 
who believes he can either incite or stop a rioe by power of voice), and , 
on the other, stood a variety of dissenters, tired of playing in the puppet 
show, but unable to CUt the final string that directed their mouths. 
Sitting high on middle ground, far above the crude emotionalism that 
dripped down the walls of the orth Conference Room , was America's 
dominant ideology. 

Kenneth and Patricia Dolbeare , authors - disseminators - of the state 
of American culture, speak of a dominant ideology that "may be so 
pervaSive , so all-encompassing, that it is not even perceived by 
obv ervers and analysts. Or the observers and analysts may be more or 
les willing parties to the use of that ideology for social control purposes 
- in this case , for the purpose of persuading other that the actions of 
the government were inevitable, deSirable , and widely ac epted by all 
Strata of the population." That dominant ideology, wh ich can be een as 
a tool of history, also , In its own crafty way, uses history as a tool for its 
machinations. What this overpowering ideology does, and did so quite 
adeptly to both Mcgill and the dissenters, is to intervene beween the 
well-hidden objective historical conditions and happenings, and the 
people who wish to evaluate them properly. It makes relatively emotional 
topics appear to be more superficial than they really are , and it enables 
some very demented interpretations - cloaked in a mask of rationality 
- to become integrated into serious discussions. 

We would phrase this ideology (the one, to the regret of the 
dissenters, that turned "Amerika" back into "America" during the late 
1970s and into this decade) as "where a Similarly-interested group of 
active thinkers will never admit that an action that they panicipated in 
was Sincerely wrong, even if the failure of their strategy was imminent." 
And as Mcgill and the dissenters shouted accusations and insults in the 
North Conference Room on Tuesday, the dominant creators of U.S. 
history were packing their implemented policies in suitcases in 
preparation for the government's history lesson to be delivered to UCSD 
on its 25th birthday. 

When the U.s. Presidential Chiefs of Staff arrive in Mandell Weiss 
Theatre to discuss our govemment(s)' (and very probably our nation's) 

poilcles, aCllOI}:" anJ 01 course ItS dominant Ideology thiS Fnday, the 
scene acted out in the North Conference Room on Tuesday will become 
more luminant. For as questions are posed to the Chiefs of Staff from 
the Kennedy to the Carter Administrations, you can bet that not one of 
them will truly admit more than a tactical error of their own, but will 
attempt to exploit the "unique" misbehavior of their colleagues. Although 
many foreign people(s) who have experienced the underside of our 
purported infallability are leaving the U.s.A's ideological flock , the 
"chiefs," most especially Haig (under Nixon), Macpherson (under L.B.J.), 
and Haldeman (seemingly under no one), will attempt to further their 
idea(s) of America's Manifest Destiny. And as the U.s.A's formerly 
hegemonic position as the world's most potent economic , political and 
cultural force is falling by the wayside in the eyes of the wat hing world, 
America 's populace cominues to fight the same, old battles. The rhetoric 
that onf' will hear at the forum will be about as stale and unpioneering 
as the objections raised by Mcgill concerning the usefulness of loud 
negotiations. The underlying gist of our hiStory, and therefore the 
mainstay of our national ideology, won't even be alluded to . [n fact, what 
we will hear is a lot of garble about achievements, about the upside of 
patriotism, and about what a bunch of "winners" we are . 

[t seems to us , though , that both sides are lOSing at a rapid rate. Since 
our culture - our popular culture that is - is born out of some inane 
pride of being the masters of overt deception, we cannot seem to help 
but to consistently miss the boat; a vessel that could bring us to the 
shores of an island called "Amerika." After the Second World War 
"America" lost its identity, which was of the pioneering SOrt, and went 
on its merry way of trying to SOcially control a traditional lifestyle that 
had not stopped growing. Hence we jumped into rwo wars, scared 
ourselves with McCanhyism, Exc\usionism, and Moralism, had a 
domestic civil war berween generations, became generally despised 
abroad , incredibly self-righteous, pious, unforgiving at home, and 
virtually dependent on the anti-intellectual slogan of "Might is Right" to 
defend our principles to our neighbors. 

Now many UCSD citizens are very proud of their administration for 
the role in getting the Chiefs of Staff [0 talk at us for rwo days. Everyone 
who attends the forum is sure to learn something, most especially about 
power, and will most likely walk out after the proceedings with that old 
"firsthand knowledge look" on their faces. But as this country splits at 
the seam as a result of a widespread indignant popular ideology, be sure 
to note that your politics are as much a part of the nation's collapse as 
anyone else's. Whether you claim to be on the right, on the left, or in 
the mainstream, you are part of a historical ideology that feeds on 
national rupture. That ideology is wrought out of greed and a failure to 
listen to another's views, and we are dying because of it.

Editor: 

As we have been made more 
than aware , this year UCSD is 
celebrating, with a smile and 
more than a few dollars, itS 25 
year history of elitist education 
and itS role in social and 
political confonnity and cultural 
and economic mdoctrination. 
Since the UniverSity controls or 
owns all the channels of 
informatIon through which the 
"official" history of the University 
is disseminated, this version of 
history presented both on and 
off campus, is at times subjective 
and narrow, and at others 
spreads blatant dlsinformation 
and propaganda. Indeed, while 
making no attempt to recognize 
a history of progressive peoples' 
struggles; includmg civIl rightS, 
women 's rights and the peace 
movement, the administration 
instead attempts to emphasize Its 
ties with the federal government 
and years of "official" U.S. 
hiStory. 

The UniverSIty has sought 
close connections with . and has 
passivel), supported , most 
government poliCIes, whatever 
the admInIstration, In return for 
lucrative research grants and 
Olher financial rewards. These 

ties are incestuously strong with 
the military struCture, who in 
league with certain UCSD 
scientists are propagating their 
imperialistiC and ideological 
expansion WIth a frightening 
anns build-up. Such a policy 
serves to aid the University 
financially and politically while 
propping up a social, political 
and economic structure 
detrimental to any progressive 
movements. 

This crafty support for, and 
association with , successive 
regImes is exemplified by the 
invitation to several Chiefs of 
Staff from past administrations to 
talk on their personal 
perspectives on 25 years of the 
presidency (and therefore the 
"official" history of the United 
States), on Jan. 17 and 18. This. 
we [eel, is a clear indication of 
the UniverSIty adminIstration's 
suppOrt of u.s. economic, 
military and cultural expansIon 
and a clear affront to the more 
progressive representatives In our 
recent histOry who will be 
ommed from the forum . 

In particular, we resem the 
omIssions of major campus-
communi ty ach Ievements ... the 
establishment and successes of 
the women 's resource center, the 

cooperative movement and the 
day-care center, the popular 
student'S struggle to establish and 
maintain Lumurnba-Zapata 
College and to name the Winnie 
Mandela Library, the prolonged 
struggle for Third World 
students' rights , the struggles of 
the student media, the fonnation 
of LAGO and the growth of a 
number of student movements 
that grew in opposition to 
injustice, inequality. conformity 
and alienation on and off 
campus. These omissions parallel 
the state's polICIes of 
disinfonnation and cultivated 
amnesia . 

It is our fi nn belief that history 
does not exist in a vacuum and 
that the last 25 years have a 
historic and ideological dynamic 
which has governed thIS nation 
and therefore UCSD. To oppose 
these policies of disinformation, 
propaganda and deliberate acts 
of omission, we of the CoalItion 
for a Free South Africa have 
called for an alternative rally to 
present a more positive and 
progressIve history 01 the past 25 
years and , In partl(~ular, to 
celebrate 25 years of people's 
struggles. Ideas and 
achlevemems The rally WIll take 
plale at noon on Friday, the 

17th of January in Revelle Plaza 
and we urge everyone to 
participate in the 
commemoration and celebr2.tion 

of the past 25 years of peoples' 
history.

AmerIca's nallonal shamel The 
land m ArIzon.1 is known as BIg 
Mountain to traditional native 
Americans. The federal 
government call it the ':Jolnt-Use 
Area" UUA). Clever governmcnt 
omclala and greedy oil 
companies have connived a 
phoney "dIspute" that they claim 
exists between NavajO and HopI 
tribes as a excuse to persuade 
Congress to pass a bill (Public 
Law 9J-53I) to relocate over 
10.000 Indian people. 

The motives of the oil 
companies are coal, uranIum and 
other minerals. When the 
inhabitants of the Big Mountain 
area are removed, it will be 
easier to move in and begin 
massive strip-mining operations. 
For over 500 years the two tnbes

Their struggle began In 197-1 
when Congress divided the JUA 
between the I avajo and HopI

been buIlt but has been taken 
down by NavajO women whose 
duty It IS In theIr soclery to 
protect the sacred homeland so 
that It (d n be pas ed on to fu ture

The forced reloc,uion IS

severe psychologIcal ilIne ses. 
The maJonry have refused ro

Writing in a Venice , CA. 
newspaper, reporter John Haag 
said: "Because the NavajO and 
Hopi haved lived for centuries in 
the Big Mountain area, both 
tribes are among the most 
culturally intact anywhere in 
Amenca. The devastation faCing 
this area and the dispersal of its 
people will destroy forever an 
irreplaceable culture with values 
that might teach us something 
about the relationship of people

mee World War 1I . U.s 
economIc poliCies toward the

the Imere tS of corporations and

~omprise the most powerful

the United States. In addition, 
both the short-run and long-run 
objectives of U.S. polIcies toward

reflected an Ideological 
consensus which is inherent in

reflected the corporate interests

is the intention of the United

righteous imperiahst actions, to 
secure the peoples of the world 
as commodity. 

The basic premise of the 
capi talist system is one of 
separating the people and thus 
reducing the human being ro an 
economic tool. This premise, by 
being' the definition of apallheid. 
is a necessary factOr of the

War resisters on the loose 
By JOHN HYATI 

A troup of soldiers enter a village 
at dawn, round up all the young 
men and press gang them into the 
government forus to ..fight the 
"rebels. " 

A bus containing children, some 
of them as young as 10 years old, is 
being driven out of a small town 
towards the battle zone. Weeping 
mothers attempt to throw 
themselves in its path to prevent its 
leaving whilst others try to stop 
them saying it's Jor the "greater 
glory oj God" that the children go. 

A letter arrives Jrom a prisoner. 
In it he pleads for the world not to 
forget, but to do something on his 
behalf. He IS right to think that the 
world has forgotten. He is still m 
prison 23 yea rs after receivmg a 
20-year se ntence. His crime: he 
refused to join the anned forces of 
his count ry. 

are many who were previously 
exempted from military service for 
health reasons. According to a 
source within the country the units 
have all "the character of a penal 
colony ... 

Scenes from life at the end of 
the laSt century or me first 
decades of this? Nol All the 
above incidents were recorded 
by the War Resisters 
International in the past year 

recognition of conscientious 
objection has traditionally been 
the struggle of pacifists and war 
resisters. But, in the 20th 
century, conscientious objection 
cannot be seen as' the perogative 
of pacifists alone. It is linked 
inexorably to the right to life and 
the right to freedom of thought, 
conscience and religion and 
therefore has as much relevance 
to the Shi'ite Muslim in Iraq, the 
Ba'athist in Iran , the Muslim in 
the Indonesia required to fight in 
this country's war against the 
Muslim population and to the 
Mennonite in Honduras as to me 
Western European or North 
American pacifist. 

In Europe itself, and indeed in 
Nonh America, where the 
struggle for the recognition of 
conscientious objection has 
primarily been waged , we have 
come a long way from the days 
of the First and even the Second 

World War where me fate of 
those who refused to be 
conscripted could be execution 
(although the last known death 
sentence for this "crime" was as 
recem as 1966 in Greece, 
thankfuly commuted after 
worldwide prot~St) . 

Slowly, and only after much 
suffering and loss not only of 
liberty but also life , attitudes 
towards the concept of 
conscientious objection to 
military service have changed. 
But the implementation of legal 
provisons have lagged behind. 

Only some 20 nations, out of 
the 80 which ooerate 
conscription, have provided a 
form of legislation which operates 
to recognize the right ~f, ... v. 
conscientious objection and 
many of these remain 
discriminatory: altemative service 
may be merely non-combatant 

Seventy men from the area 
surrounding one town are pubhcly 
executed for ch eir refusa l to jom the 
amled forces. Their fa milies are 
invited to view the executIOns and 
after the ceremony are ordered to 
pay for the costs of them. In 
another COwn in che same country 
the fnends of the two executed men 
are ordered to carry the corpses 
through the streets oj the town III 
order to warn others thlllkll1g oj 
tr}1ng to aVOId nllhtary servIce of 
the fate thac awallS them. 

and a half: the press gangs 
operate in El Salvador, and 
children are being used by Iran 
to clear me minefields so that its 
soldiers can pursue the country's 
war with Iraq. The latter country, 
meanwhile, publicly executes 
those who refuse to be 
conscripted for religious reasons 
or who have desened ramer than 
take pan in a senseless and 
bloody war. The Cuban who, for 
his refusal to kill , has suffered a 
term of imprisonment longer 
than most murderers receive has 
now, thankfully, been released,

of a limited character (e .g. its 
nature be such that it cannot be

beliefs that brought the 
conscientious objector to make 
such a stand in the first place). 
There are still countries in 
Western Europe where 
conscientious objection is not yet 
recognized (Switzerland) or 
where, because mere is no 
recognition and the country is 
on a permanent war footing, the 
fate of the conscientious objecto( 
could be me death penalty 
(Turkey). 

The conscientious objectors of 
the Eastem European state face a 
tremendous struggle confronted , 
as they are, with constitutions 
and legal statutes that are riddled 
with oratorical phrases that 
invoke the individual's dury to 
the State: "Military service in the 
armed force of the U's.S.R" 
(Anicle 63 of the Soviet 
ConstHucion). But groupings of 
conscientious objectors are

nothing happened; there was too

Gerald Warren , Editor of the 
San Diego Union , suggested that 
UCSD arrange a symposium at 
which all the chiefs of staff from 
Eisenhower through Caner 
would meet. He had thought "the 
history depanment should have 
some role to play in UCSD's 
anniversary and it would be nice 
to do something on the 
presidency," he said. 

"I pointed OUt that the chiefs 
of staff had never been together 
on the same floor, and that 
seellled to tickle the fancy of 
john (Galbraith) and Michael 
(Parrish)," Warren said. Warren , 
Depury Press Secretary for Nixon

of the chiefs of staff and was 
responsible for inviting them.

chief of staff from 1980 to 1981 
and secretary to the cabinet. He 
now works for an Atlanta law 
firm. 

The Coalition For A Free 
Soum Africa is planning a strike 
for the proceedings and a rally 
in Revelle Plaza at noon 
tomorrow. 

Representatives of the 
Coalition say that the strike is 
directed against the university's 
perceived involvement with 
militarism. 

Protestors call the chiefs of 
staff symposium an act of 
"disinformation" intended to 
mislead the public about the 
university'S connection with the 
military and the government. 

"I can identify with d lot of 
that," Parrish said as he read a 
Coalition flyer. "I have a lot of

grave reservations about our 
government's involvement in 
foreign and domestic policy." 

The symposium is intended as 
a medium through which me 
students and faculty can raise 
serious questions and receive 
answers. "I will be very 
disappointed if they (the chiefs 
of staff) aren't asked any tough 
questions," Parrish said. 

"Twenty-Five Years of the 
Presidency." a cooperative effort 
by the university and San Diego 
community leaders, will be 
broadcast, starting at 9 pm, Jan .

Rebelling all the way 
to the dreaded altar 
By KEN FURIE, Concnbucmg Fraturf' Editor 

H E WAS A rebel. I suppose you could sull call him a rebel, but as far as I'm 
concerned, he was a rebel. 
Because now, he only thinks hke 
a rebel. He doesn't act like one 
But I'm starting at the end of the 
story 

In high school many of the 
kids thought m>' friend Enc was 
weird He didn 't care , and I 
thought that was great And most 
of the kids didn't hke to talk to 
him, eIther, because he would 
always ask them uncomfortable 
que tIons 

"Do you know what our 
gOl'emmem IS uomg 10 
Nicaragua and ChIle1" he would 
demand 

And If you encourJged him at 
all he would tell you In detail 
what our government IS dOing 10 
Nicaragua and ChIle and the 
PhilIppines and an>where else 

\ \ , 
\ 

you don't want to know about. 
You s.ee, that was the 

difference between him and 
everyone else: he cared. He 
actually cared what his 
government was domg, and what 
his society was do 109, He was 
always bitching about current 
affairs and events, and he was 
concerned because everyone was 
so concerned With trlvlal matters. 

As far as I'm concerned , he's 
not a rebel anymore , because 
he's lost the anger that made 
him such a radical. What 
happened? What else? 
Happiness. With a girl. 

Not that girls are so bad, but 
for him. who has never rl'ally 
had one; it has made a decent, 
easy person out of him He 's In 
love, I mean Love . and It has 
changed his life. 

I can't really understand the 
sorrow I feel when I thInk about 
him and his girl, and the 
happiness she bnngs him. 
Perhaps I am jealous. haVIng had 
so much of his attentIon , and 
haVIng been a close to him , It 
almost seems like I don 't know 
him anymore 

We were wgether all the time 
I admired him . I envied him hiS 

energy and I envl(:d him hiS 
volatility He 'ova :s,·e,/[. He once 
refused to go through graduauon 
ceremOnies, because the school 
was making all the senior sign 
an agreement th,lt they would 
not throw J beachbaU around 
dunng the ceremOnIes We all 
knew Enc wasn 't gOIng (0 toss 
ilround any beilchball, but he 
refused to sign on pnnclple I 
thought that \1'ilS 0 cool! 

~lIsdIrected. yes Sill>. perhilps, 
But cool. nevertheless. 

He and hiS girl (lady, I (iln 
hear him correct me) Im'Ited me 
over for dmner the other night. [ 
had spaghetti They hild each 
other, I never thought It was 
pOSSible for il human to swallow 
another human , but [ had m\' 
doubt that nIght They w re' all 
over each other Jnd I got to 
watch and tf} not to gag on mr 
food. I had some close calls that 

night We listened to some 
records after dInner, and I 
t pped my foot , danced around . 
and sang at the tOP of my lungs. 
In order to get their attention 
away from the all-consumIng task 
of suckIng the other's tongue out 
of his/ her respective mouths. 

, called him outsKle. '" can't 
stand it," I told him 

Ken, you've gOt to understand . 
For the fIrst time In my life. [ 
feel a~ If I am worth somethIng. 
You can t believe what she does 
for m~ .. She's the best thing 
that has ever happened to me. 
I'm in love , man,just like you _n 

"But 1 don 't try and hump my 
girl in front of -" 

"Okay, I'm sorry about that 
But I'm 22 years old, and I've 
never had a girlfriend .. Ken . , 
sne s mcredlble. She ca,es. man. 
she cares I tell her my problems. 
and she cne~ , because I'm 
hurtIng. Can you belIeve It? I'm 
walking 100 feet off the ground , 
JUSt thInkIng that he's there In 
the house , and I .. I can reach 
OUt, touch her fa e with my 
fInger, and she'll be glad How 
can you not understand1 You 
know. Ken . I know you do ." 

I knew Yeah I knew a how 

'ould I deny him my approval 
when he made him so happy? 

I went home that nIght, and I 
co uldn 't help thinking about the 
.:ra::\ days 

~ m.l·ny [lines. wHh gUitars 
Qr.lpped on our b<lcks, we'd 
hiked up to the top of Mission 
Pe.lk. \~hll'h towered over our 
neighborhood, toIlmg for an 
hour up dry gullies and 
crJmbhng o\'el rocks In the 

u,u k. and when we got to the 
wp . hreathle s, our heart would 
L~1t h ilt the SIght below our feet 

The \1 hole \Imld , It seemed. 
was spread OUt before us In a 
vast tapestf}' of colors and lIght 
the ~tree t s streched out, groping 
mtO the darkness, we 'd sing. and 
play ~ongs together. Jnd

And now, he has a girl.

He was so Innocent then, too. 
I loved that about him. He once 
asked me, in all sinceri ty: "Ken 
wh:u 's It like to kiss a gi rl , and 
really mean it 7" 

I thought a whIle . "It ·s '" the 
best thIng I've ever known . 
There 's nothIng beuer. Not when 
you really mean It." 

"Better than sex?" 
"Yes In many ways. It's better 

than the sex the way our world

have sex it you don 't mean ll . 
You can kiSS . sure. But don't

He belIeved me because I 
belIeved me , We knew each 
other, and could not lIe. 

We once threw some clothes,

Rerurning from our whalIng expedition , the \VI nd had blown 
lip \1 IICCJpS and the little boat bounced and slapped the water 
lIke J skipped stone. 

We were standing in a motel parking lot. adminng the 
gleaming blue, brand-new imported outboard motor on the 
back of the boat, when an old Marine In a tight brown 
polyester t-shirt walked over. The man was a catastrophe of 
saturated fats; rolls of fat started at his chin and piled up on 
each other all the way to the top of his brown polyester pants. 
The image he presented was unmistakable , 

"So you wen! and bought one of them goddamned slit-eyed 
engines." The man's ship came in from the Pacific 40 years ago 
and dropped him off. "Goddamned Jap engines ain 't worth 
shit. Damn Vietkneez are taking over this goddamn 
neighborhood ... 

My father knew better but couldn't resist acknowledging the 
dope. "This is a Japanese mOtor. not a Vietnamese motor. My 
son' ca r is JapaneSl' :l11c1 h;>s about 150.000 miles on it. I like 
Japanese engInes." (Actually the dirty old Toyota had about 
120.000 miles on it and plenty of problems to show for them.)

as him an' me iJoy, you're gain ' to have to go to them goddamn

My mother's ship came in about the same time as the old 
red neck's but from Italy. It was the last of what they caUed the 
LIberty ~hlps . She was three years-old when u let ner all In 
Hoboken with her parents and sister. There were factories in 
the sa me sta t~ which built the bombs that good 01' boys 
dropped on m)' mother's home town. 

The family had a dog named "Lula" in Pola . She would start 
howlmg when she heard the bombers coming - usually fi ve

ever came in. They gave her away because she chewed the

Men lose game 
and tempers 
By MA IT LAlT, Sta.D Wntel 

U P AND DOWN the Triton bench, the players' face showed definite signs of 
unhappmess and runnoil as the 
Point Lorna Nazarene Crusaders 
beal them 61 -5 2, Tuesday night 
at the gym. 

The players' disgruntled 
feelings, however, did not appear 
out of nowhere ; they have been 
building up for some time. just 
ask ex-stamng guard Jim Smith. 

After last week's loss in the 
otre Dame game , jim Smith , the 

exciting, emotional, and 
sometimes erratic pomt guard for 
the Tritons , apparently quit when 
he threw his Jersey to Coach 
Marshall saying, "Here's a present 
for you." He was upset with hIS 
play 109 time . 

"If I had it over again," said 
Smith, "I probably wouldn't have 
done it. I was frustrated over the 
amount of time I played but 1 
was also frustrated with the way 
I've been playing. My shooting 
percentage has been down , my 
passing has been off and I've 
been making some turnovers." 

mlth IS still on the tcam after 

a meeting with Coach Marshall ; 
however, he no longer tart . The 
inCident has nothing to do with 
him lOSing his lamng position , 
accordi ng to Marshall. "It was a 
change that was going to be 
made before . I think we need the 
conSistent sleady pace of Mike 
(Alvarado) to begin the game and 
then bnng jim off the bench to 
spark the team." 

Smith declined to comment 
upon whether the incident cost 
him his starti ng role. 

Many of the fans at the Point 
Lorna game felt that Smith 
should have been starting. Fans 
in the stands }'elled "We want 
Smith ." Mosl of the cheers were 
instigated by members of the 
ZBT fraternity. Besides the 
cheers for Smith , the}' loudly 
ridiculed the referees, the Point 
Loma learn , their cheerleaders, 
their fans , but also UCSD's 
Coach Marshall. 

Smith is not the only player 
who seems upset. Marshall has 
noticed the ani lude among some 
of the players, and he plans to

6-0 in '85 as women 
revenge loss to Whittier 
By FLIP HARRlSON StLl.1/ U nttr 

V ICTORIOU ITI thei r Tue day night game over WhlltlCr by a score 01 
58-56, and in theI r last five 
games, the Tritons ' women's 
basketball team have become the 
exciting defenSive powerhouse 
they thought they would be. 
Behind team leader Heidi 
Jungling's 20 pOintS, the club 

beat a tough Whittier te,lm they 
had lost to ,everal weeks ago. 

That was a great ... ,nn ," said 
coach judy Malone, "They beat 
us over the Chnstmas break and 
had a 9-3 re ord and we really 
showed them . It felt great to get 
them back " 

The game was almost toO close 
for comfort for the Tritons, 
though . Going into halftime with 
a 33-24 lead, the team looked 
like sure winners. In the second 
half. however, the club let 
Whittier come back and almost 
walk away With the game. 

Things staned looking grim 
wuh the Triton's up by only two 
POIntS With 24 seconds left in 
the game and Whittier 
inbounding the ball. The ball 
never got to a Whittier player 
though as freshman star Shelli 
Velie caused the steal, 
consequently bagging the game 
for UCSD. The win also keeps 
alive the teams undefeated 
record of 1986. 

"We are really coming together 
as a team ," said Velie. 
"Everybody is comributing." 

The Tritons are getting a lot of 
help from the bench, including 
19 points in this game. Six of 
the points came from Kim 
StoneCipher who hit three 
consecutive 20-foot bombs In the 
second half. A great game also 
came from jennifer Gregory who 
has just recently returned from a 
knee injury and had seven 

e points

Q': 

Women's tennis set to start 
new era - and season - Jan. 24 

By DAVID TEDROW, Staff Wmer 
At thi s time last year, the 

UCSD women's tenni s team was 
set. Virtually the entire squad 
was returning sta rters, and they 
knew from the outset they would 
eventually be playmg for the 
national cham pionship. Coach 
LIZ laPlante said , "We had 
almost the sa me team for Ihe last 
four years (only losing twO 
starters in that span) so the team 
was set from the beginning " The 
season went as planned, and the 
1985 squad won the DIVision III 
title , With four members of rhe 
team receivmg Ali-American 
honors. 

All that is anuent history 
however, and this year the team's 
futUi IS not 0 clear The 
patem ial is there , but noth Ing 
has yet heen proven on the 
couns. With only one returner 
from L!;,t yeat\~ta rtlng line-up. 

the success of this year's "qllad 
will be detennined by the play of 
relatively inexperienced 
newcomers. 

Although they only have one 
returning starter, she happens to 
be jessica Vernon , last year's 
number-one singles player. In 
addition to leading the team to 
the national championship, 
Vernon also made the semi-finals 
In individuals competition , and 
along with her panner, won the 
national doubles title. In order 
for thiS year's team to repeat as 
champions, Vernon will have to 
match last year's success in 
Singles play, as well as making 
the adjustment to a new doubles 
partener, most likely Maggie 
Merickc\. 

:-.tenckcl wa~ a starting 
doubles player lor the 1 mons 

1,I~t yeM, anti thiS season she Will 

move up to play singles as well. 
Aside from Merickcl , the only 
players with varsity experience 
arc Debbie DePaoli, a member of 
lasl year's team, and Caroline 
Lee , who played twO vears ago. 

Lack of experience' may be a 
problem at the stan of the 
season, but lack of depth hould 
not trouble this year's team. 
Coach laPlante feels that her top 
six players will all be very close. 
So the potential for success is 
there ; all that remains is for the 
team to prove i tscl fin 
competltlon. They begin doing 
Just that on jan 24 agamsl 
Redlands, and then on Jan . 31 at 
Claremont. The Redlands match 
will be at 2 pm on the Muir 
Courts, and It IS the home 
opener lor th c defendmg 
natlon,ll champIOns. ~ 

Men's V-ball 
looking for 
.500 season 
By TOM fERGUSON, Sta.D Writer 

This season, the UCSD men's 
volleyball team is not facing as 
tough a schedule as they have in 
the past, but suffice it to say that 
their opponents in 1986 are not 
going to be pushovers. Head 
coach, Digger Graybill, says that 
their schedule "has improved 
over last year. There are many 
more teams that we have the 
potential to be VIctorious 
over." However, about 60 percent 
of the teams that the Tmons will 
play belong to NCAA Division I, 
but thiS hasn't thwarted any 
optimistic outlook for the season. 
"It's a tough schedule for us, but 
we are a better team this year. 
We could have a .500 season." 

Not only is Graybill optimiSlic 
regarding th~ team as a whole, 
but individually as well: "We do 
have pretty good personneL" The 
Tritons have twO new additions 
that may prove valuable, 
freshmen ScOtt Kirst and Chris 
Carpenter, both of whom are 
coming from one of the top high 
schools in Southern California, 
Edison High . Kirst is a 6'2" right-
side hitter and Carpenter, his 
teammate, is a 6'1" left-side hitter 
and was second team all-CIF last 
year. Both helped lead Edison to 
the CIF 4-A Division semi-finals. 
"They are good players from one 
of the top programs," said 
Graybill, who is looking towards 
his returning players as well: 
Scott Criswell, a 6'4" fourth-year 
player; Scon MacGregor, a 6'2" 
senior power attacker; jeff 
Babcock, a sophomore outside 
hitter; setter Mark Lehrer, and 
others. 

In order to prepare for this 
season, the Tritons played in 
various tournaments during the 
fall in Los Angeles against some 
of the top teams in the country 
from Division I and open 
divisions. They didn't fair too 
well, but coach Graybill says that 
it was a positive experience in 
the respect that his squad 
proved that they can compete 
with the bigger schools and be 
in contention for a spot on the 
"Top 20." 

The Tritons will make their 
home debut on Saturday, Jan. 21 
against UCSD alumni, and will 
host their first major match Feb. 
7 against Loyola-Matymount, a 
Division I team. Graybill 
anticipates a home match against 
Penn State University, a team 

WOlllen's 
B-ball 

came from starting center Heidi 
jungling. Scoring over 20 pOints 
in her second straight game, 
jung1ing is playing with 
confidence and corning into her 
own . Receiving the MVP award 
of the La Jolla Classic and getting 
press in the Los A~lgeles Tim es, 
she IS also getting more attention 
than ever. "It 's great to know all 
the hard work and long hours 
Me finally paying off But I al 0 
know It takes Ju!>t a!> much work 
to slay on tOp ." 

The Tntons, now With a 7-7 
record , Will t,lke their 
unblem l!>hcd 1986 record of li ve 
In a row Into their game .Igalnst 
La Verne on fnday lhc game IS

g,IOle (iJ 

thJt last year was r.lnkcd number 
7 in the nation and was beaten 
by UCSD. "Then the last pan of 
the schedule gets pretty tough ," 
when four of the last five 
matches are versus DiviSion I 
schools. 

But,first things first. UCSD 
begins their season Friday, 
januaty 17 at Moraga against St. 
Maty's College, a team that has 
just turned Division I thiS 
season. "Last year they were not 
very good," said Graybill , "and 
we beat them badly." But money 
talks, and their new scholarships 
may tum up some exceptional 
players. On Saturday, the Tritons 
travel to an all-Cal Tournament 
at Berkeley which features all-UC 
school teams and clubs. ~

deal with It . 

"I plan to make some changes 
if it persists," said Marshall. "Not 
changes in the line-up but 
changes in the personnel. Any 
player with a bad attitude about 
the team is going to get kic ked 
off." 

Smith said that the problem 
lies in the fact that "We have so 
many good players from winning 
programs that it hurts to lose. 
Every player on the bench thinks 
he should be in , it's only 
natura\." 

The Tritons have the mixed 
blessing of having a lot of depth 

and thiS creates some Intense 
competiti on . It IS nor apparenr, 
however, that there are III 
feelings among the players. "I 
think we 're a pretty together 
unit ," said Center And y Jedynak. 
"There isn 't any animosity 
directed at the fellow playe rs ," 
added Smith . The game at Point 
Loma made the Tritons a .500 
team again at 8-8. 

At the start of the game UCSD 
looked sharp both olTensively 
and defenSively as they shOt OUt 
to a 8-0 lead. Point Loma called 
a timeout and from then on the 
Crusaders got on track. Halftime 
saw the Tritons down by three , 
26-23. 

The second half was rather 
exciting with the lead being tied 
several times. But when UCSD 

Thursday, January 16,1986 11 
SPORTS 

needed their ot/ense to perlorm 
they were sadly disappointed. 
They shot only 36 percent [or 
the game and even Coach 
Marshall "was surprised it was 
that high ." 

With eight minutes left in the 
second half, the game was over. 
The Crusaders pulled away to 
win 61-52. 

"We played great defense 
tonight," said Marshall , "but 
olTensively we were very weak. I 
can't be too disappointed 
though , they're a NISA team, not 
a Division III team." 

The Tritons will try to pull 
things together Thursday night 
when they do battle against 
Christ College in Irvine. The 
next home game will be january 
17 against La Verne. ~

The dancers on the floor of 
the Belly Up Tavern in Solana 
Beach twirl and hurl in kinetic 
arcs to a high energy version 
of the classic "Woolly Bully" 
(by none other than Sam the 
Sahm &the Pharoahs). When 
the bass line of "Domino" 
starts in, everybody is on the 
floor, swinging to the get~up~ 
'n'-go sound of the Mar Dels. 

UCSD and the Mar Dels go 
together like bobby sox and 

two~tone shoes. They even 
had Chancellor Atkinson and 
his cronies snapping their 
fingers at the 25th anniversary 
celebration. Whether at the 
Pub or the Winter Formal, the 
Mar Dels have been there, 
pumping their upbeat sound 
into UCSD's ears and bones. 

The Mar Dels are plainly 
unmistakable , or rather , 
ostentatiously unmistakable . 
The four male members, lead 
singer Doug Alien, guitarist 
Jesse Horner, drummer 
Albert Williams and bass 
player Burt Newman, can be 
seen in anything from 
matching pink sport jackets to 
shiny silver imitation~ 
snakeskin suits with wide 
lapels. The two new horn 
players slip on shades so dark 
they won't even know yo' 
name ... Jake and Elwood in 
person. The whole lotofthem 
wouldn't be caught dead (or 
even unconscious) without 
bowties and wingtips, and 
their hair is a refinery of 
petroleum jelly and other goo. 

The draw of the band owes 
a lot to two flamboyant 
singers/dancers: April Dole 
and Angel O'Brien. They are a 
double whammy of lightening 
bolts yoked together.

Rank and File's Kinman brothers, Chip and Tony, may not have sold as 
many records or attracted as much attention as the brothers Everly - or 
even the brothers Schmenge - but they have earned the respect of many 
important people. To be specific, the Everlys, Don and Phil, have recently 
recorded Rank and File's " Amanda Ruth, " the rambunctious opening 
track from RAPs splendid debut album, Sundown. 

As for the Kinmans themselves, they haven't exactly been idle -well, 
almost, since Rank and File has been on a performing hiatus since not too 
long after the failure of its highly disappointing second album (which was 
distributed - in a manner of speaking - by that equally fraternal record 
company, Warner Bros.). But they 're back now, reportedly with a 
vengeance - and with guitarist Jeff Ross and drummer Bobby Kahr - to 
drive home their oft-times stunning synthesis of downhome country-
western, unabashedly romantic ballads and bashingly performed rock 'n 
roll. 

Not only that, but the brothers will be performing this Sunday night at 
9 (LA faves Rain Parade open) in the Revelle Cafeteria, close to their 
one-time familial home of Carlsbad (after stints in New York and Austin, 
the boys seem to have settled in smogville).

Taking a bite out of the Big Apple 
by susan peters 

Christmas in New York - it's almost a cliche. 
More specifically, it was the three week Christmas-
New Year's holiday spent in the Big Apple; a first 
introduction with the purpose of demystifying the 
legendary city. Part one: beyond the JFK airport. 

First of all, the New York subway wasn't the 
writhing sardine can packed with muggers, 
pickpockets and vigilantes it's made out to be. My 
stop, 23rd Street, may not have the marble and 
glass decor of the Louvre metro station in Paris, but 
it is relatively well-lit and provides benches to wait 
on - that is, it serves its purpose. As for the grafitti 
for which the New York subway is famous, after a 
while it becomes a shock to see a carriage that hasn't 
been baptized by the spray can or blue marker of 
"Bambie" and "X," or "Amos" or a Prince fan (Oh 
well, it takes all kinds ... ) 

Part two: where to get off the subway. A ride on 
the Staten Island ferry seemed a good way to get 
introduced to sights of the city. Possibly the least 
expensive sightseeing activity in New York, for 25 
cents you can have a nice little cruise across the 
Upper New York Bay, past Ms. Liberty (who's 
presently under reconstruction) giving that 
famous, yet still impressive, view of the Manhattan 
skyline. 

There was a man selling gloves and scarves to the 
ferry passengers, managing to do a bit of business 
here and there. "Hats, scarves, gloves ... Get it all 
together for the cold weather. Everything you need 
so you won't freeze. Something to wear when the 
bus isn't there .. . " 

Dinner time, and my friend and I found 
ourselves in a small Italian restaurant in the Village. 
Ah, the Village. I soon discovered my niche in New 
York. The small streets, the iron railings on the 
houses, the steep steps leading up to the front doors 
all look familiar - like a Hollywood set from one 
of those countless movies said to take place in New 
York. It's one of the liveliest places to be, 
particularly at night: cafes, bookshops, vintage 
clothes boutiques, record shops, theatres (one 
advertised a double billing of Annie Hall and 
Manhattan, which seemed rather appropriate). 

After dinner we had cappuccino in a little, 
recently opened cafe that we discovered. Cafle 
Passionel can be found on Carmine Street in the 
Village. Elegant without being pretentious - brass 
vases with real carnations, brick walls and two 
fireplaces , classical music playing in the 
background - the cafe offers a variety of pastries as 
well as a few meals. 

"How 1 wish 1 was in New Yark Ciry 
Christmas here could ne'-'eT be like that." 

-"Christmastime Here" fry Wednesday Week 

Christmas in New York is a time of earmuffs and 
colored lights , and decorative windows, 
particularly in the large department stores like 
Macy's and Sak's and Lord and Taylor. And there 
are signs that people still appreciate the religious 
Significance of the holiday - tickets for the 
Midnight Mass at Saint Patrick's are sold (and sold 
out) up to three to four months in advance. 

Playing at the Metropolitan Opera during the 
holiday season was a three.part performance, called 
"Parade" and billed as "An Evening of French 
Music Theatre." It was comprised of two operas 
and one ballet with the music of Eric Satie, Francis 
Poulenc and Maurice Ravel. It opened with Satie's 
Parade, whose colorful array of costumes and 
circus characters reflected the madness of Satie's 

.,.. ______ .,1111111111 ........ 1 •• 11111111 •••••• 11 __ •• 

own musical temperament and provided the logical 
result of the combined chemistry of its creators, 
Satie, Picasso and Cocteau. 

This was followed by Poulenc's opera, Les 
Mamelles de Tiresias , a humoro us look at the 
traditional female role of housewife and 
babymaker in which a wife rebels and changes 
places with her husband, donning the trousers and 
beard, and leaving him in the dress and apron to 
make the babies - which he does. 

Lastly, Ravel's L'Enfant et les Sartileges, about a 
schoolboy who's bored with his homework and 
would rather tease the cat and eat cookies. 

Magically, the entire set comes to life as chairs crawl 
away, storybook characters step out of pages,and 
suddenly the room is transformed into a forest 
filled with animals. 

Reminiscent of pantomimes and ballets I had 
seen as a child, Parade was a wonderfully visual and 
lively evening's entertainment appealing to both 
children and adults. The costumes and sets alone 
were worth seeing - stripes beside polka dots, 
greens on red - everything you'd never seen "in 
real life," but had wished you could. 

Meanwhile, the Christmas show at the Radio 
City Music Hall, a rather fragmented array of 
yuletide excerpts done in song and dance and ice 
skating, paled in comparison. Despite the 
costuming and rather elaborate stage maneuvers 
(the entire orchestra disappeared through the floor 
on the stage to reappear at the other end, making 
way for a skating rink), the Christmas Spectacular 
was strikingly unoriginal. 

The opening teddy bear version of the Nutcracker 
Suite could only appeal to young children. Then 
there was an extremely abbreviated version of 
Dicken's A Christmas Carol in which the "Bah 
Humbug" Scrooge and the phantom visits are 
omitted, jumping strailZht to the new holiday. 

loving Mr. Scrooge. In doing this, someone was 
obviously relying on the assumption that most 
people are already familiar with the story; yet, when 
the insanely happy o ld man appeared on the stage, 
the small boy sitting next to me whispered to his 
mother, " Who's that?" 

"Christmas in New York," inside Santa's 
workshop, and the Music Hall 's rendition of "The 
Twelve Days of Christmas" lost their interest very 
quickly. 

One saving grace of the show was the appearance 
of the Rockettes who, as the announcer remarked, 
have taken part in the holiday special for over 50 
years. (The same ones? -Ed~) In their flashy white 
and silver costumes, they performed a leggy chorus 
line that would have been even more impressive 
had they not already appeared twice that evening 
with a similar routine. 

Lastly, there was a finale that was almost 
blasphemous in its inclusion in such a glittery 
snow-and-Santa-oriented Christmas show. Again, 
another ancient tale was retold and a well-known 
scene was enacted, that of the Nativity scene. The 
production was well done, but the only real novelty 
was the three live camels crossing the stage. When 
the creche was completed, the announcer revealed 
(in his K-Tel voice) the significance of the birth of 
the child who "never wrote a book or held an 
office," yet had greater impact on the world "than 
any ruler or parliament." 

So ended a "Christmas Spectacular" which 
began with dancing teddy bears. "Christmas," 
perhaps ... 

New Year's Eve - where else to spend it but with 
everyone else, in Times Square. From 8 pm to 8 am 
January I, the subway was free of charge, so there 
was no fumbling for a token in the rush to make it 
to the Square in time to watch the big apple drop. 
There, 150,000 people saw the illuminated red 
apple at the top of the building slowly fall, then 
disappear as 1986 began. Champagne, confetti and 
people with silly hats filled the streets. Afterwards, 
many people took advantage of the free fare (on the 
eve of the lO-cent increase), and spent the 
remainder of the night wandering around the city, 
trying to get into the dance clubs. Naturally, I 
headed back towards the Village, from where I had 
started. 

It's nota bad little town, New York. A lot of what 
one hears about it is true - it can be very cold and 
grey and a bit hard on people at times. To survive 
there you have to be a bit tough, but not heartless. 
Busy and crowded as the city may be, there are still 
people who are able to find a quarter for the old 
woman on the subway's steps, or help a blind 
person find his way, or even shout a holiday 
greeting from a bicycle to the crowds of post-
Christmas shoppers - in New York fashion of 
course: "Happy f***ing New Year!"

caginess as a fire-red coal. 
Angel is a Diana Ross: large 
eyes, extroverted style, and a 
strong voice that cuts through 
the undermusic. 

Doug Allen is the driving 
force for the Mar Dels, on 
stage and off. He does most of 
the lead vocals, dancing and 
prancing around with the 
mike whenever he's not 
swinging the bell of his 
squealing sax high into the air. 
A 25-year-old Del Mar native 
who went to SDSU, he left 
school when the band started 
taking off. He complains, 
"Running a band is a full-time 
job. You gona spend a lot of 
time on the phone and just 
organizing things." 

Sure, it seems a glamorous 
and care-free life being part of 
a rock 'n' roll band. But 
there's another side to it. 

Allen explai ns, " Yo u see, 
personalities can rea ll y clash 
in a band . Believe m e: I've 
seen it . It 's to ugh, 'cause 
you 're depending o n each 
o ther every moment. Like if 
so mebody starts sc rewin ' 
around, it can really throw 
you off. W e had this bass 
player - no , two bass players 
- flake out on us. One of 'em 
just left right in the middle of a 
gig and never came back. 
Another guy we gor was flaky, 
too. He started playing the 
bass like it was a lead guitar, 
right in the middle of a song. 
We had to get rid of him." 

The whole thing got started 
in the first place because Allen 
wanted the kind of music that 
was fun. He laughs, "J got so 
sick of lousy bands in bars I 
decided to start my own 
band." But getting a band 
together certainly wasn't easy. 
"You can find a thousand 
talented people, but it's hard 
to find even one who is 
committed and willing to be 
professional.' ,

Terry, Gilliam, of Monty 

Python fame, has collaborated 
with humorist Tom Stoppard 
and Charles McKeown to 
create one of the most 
dramatic, humorous and well-
aimed films of the year. 

Brazil has been categorized 
as an Orwellian fantasyl 
nightmare. The backdrop - a 
dismally gray, endless city 
complete with an overkill of 
militarism and well-displayed 
propaganda - is definitely 
Orwellian in nature. The main 
themes as well stir echoes of 
1984: the inevitable loss of 
individualism in a society 
completely controlled by 
bureaucratic paperwork and 
red tape, as well as the 
disintegration and destruction 
of the family unit. But with 
this skeletal structure of 
Orwellian visions, Gilliam has 
fleshed out the body and soul 
of a film with brilliant 
originality and searing reality, 
which is much closer to home 
than 1<)84. 

Air ducts and wiring and 
hoses and pipelines have a 
creeping presence, as they 
infiltrate and overwhelm 
rooms and houses and 
buildings and shopping malls. 
Indeed, the creeping, insect-
like nature of these normally 
hidden aspects of our culture 
is greatly enhanced by the 
music score, which scuttleS', 
buzzes, snaps and bumps 
during these sequences. 

Jonathon Pryce plays 
Lowry, our tragic hero, who 
alternates between his 
fantastic nightmare / day-
dreams and his real life duties, 
until he encounters the girl of 
his dreams (Kim Greist) in 
everyday life. 

The movie has a lot to offer 
in the way of acting, with 
strong supporting roles from 
Katherine Helmond (from 

A fricru1/:y plastic surgeon. 

Tuttle. 
The main problem with the 

film seems to be that, because 
of the many dream sequences, 
with sharp transitions, Brazil 
becomes a bit difficult to 
follow. Obviously, this is 
intentional. Gilliam throws so 
many ideas, angles, per-
spectives and symbols into 
one brief minute of footage 
that it is impossible to believe 
he wants you to grasp 
everything that passes before 
your eyes. Therefore, the 
viewer must relax. allow the 
film to sweep him or her 
where it wants to, and in the 
end , one cannot help but 
appreciate the visionary 
craftsmanship that has gone 
into the making of Brazil.

Baryshnikov) is a legend-in-
his-own-time ballet dancer 
and Soviet defector who is 
forced back into the U.S.S.R. 
when his plane makes an 
emergency landing in Siberia. 
(Why would a defector be 
flying o ver Siberia? Why 
wo uld a nyo ne fl y ove r 
Siberia?) Once there, the 
dancer is put unde r the semi-
watchfu l eye of anothe r 
dancer , Raymond Green-
wood (Gregory Hines), an 
American who fled his 
country in protest of its 
involvement in Vietnam. 

To gain favor with the 
Soviet government, Raymond 
must convince Kolya to 
remain in the Soviet Union. 
For reasons that are not made 
altogether clear, Raymond, 
his wife (Isabella Rossellini) 
and Kolya go to Kolya's 
luxurious former apartment 
in Leningrad, wher e 
Raymond is to help the ballet 
dancer prepare for opening 
night at the great Kirov theatre 
- no matter that Raymond is 
a tap dancer ("That's your 
problem," the Soviet 
authorities tell him). 

What ensues is a series of 
chases, dancing, crying and 
more than several glimpses of 
Baryshnikov's bare chest (he 
swears, too!). Of all the trivial 
plot points, the dancing is 
easily the best and most 
sincere, and reason enough to 
see the movie. 

The dance numbers are 
supposed to interweave with 
the story so as to "expand" it 
along the lines of West Side 
Story. This ambitious attempt 
sometimes succeeds , but 
often jiggly camera move-
ments disrupt the spontaneity
