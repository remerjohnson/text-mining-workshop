COMPLAINTS 
DELAYED 
ELECTION' 
RESULTS 

Khanna and Co. Emerge Victorio'us 

Last -minute grievances 
threatened candidate 
disqualification. Watts 
found guilty by 
elections committee. 

By DavidJohnston 
STAFF WRITER 

The annoucement of this year's 
election results held to tradition. Each 
slate gathered at Round Table Pizza 
on campus, waiting for the elections 
committee to release the final tally. 
Everything was the same, except one 
thing: The results were six hours late. 

KUNAl 

Before the election, ti:imds ·Daniel 
Watts and Harry Klianna made a 
pact that while running against one 
another for the A.S. pre~ident posi-
tion, they would work out all but 
the most ~rious grievances through 
mutual discussions without filing for-
mal charges. Student Voice! prtSidmt-««t Horrv IC1Ianna (MIler) lets loore a dt«r with his supporters as AS. Elections Manager Charlene Cheng annouOO!S his vidory Over opponent Daniel Watts. 

For much of last week's campaign, 
the agreement held fast. But at the 
II th hour of April 14, the elections 
committee was inundated with for-
mal grievances filed by both candi-
dates, each alleging that his oppo-
nent's slate, Watts' Tritons United! 
and Khanna's Student Voice!, had 
violated the rules of the eJection. The 
agreement was off. 

Khanna filed an official griev-
ance against Watts on April 13, which 
served as the initial catalyst, alleging 
that through the congressional cam· 
paign of John Muir College alumnus 
Bryan Barton, Watts sent an e-mail to 
voters containing malicious lies and 
libel about SV!. Khanna said that this 
filing did not break his agreement 
with Watts. 

"The agreement was that there 
would be no grievances unless the 
other party violated a bylaw a) with 
malicious intent, or b) that could 
plausibly change the outcome of the 
election," Khanna said. "[The e-malll 
satisfied one or both of those condi-
tions, so a grievance from us was 
consistent with our agreement:' 

Watts has denied involvement in 
the e-mail, saying that he was not 
its author and that Khanna's only 
evidence against him was that Watts 
knew Barton. 

In response to the formal charge, 
Watts unleashed more than 20 griev-
ances of his own on April 14 against 
Khanna and SV!, including alleged 
violations of posting rules and volun-
tary spending limits. 

"Now that the corruption of 
[Khanna'sl slate has been exposed,

Tritons United!'s 
Eddie Herrera wins 
vice presidential 
position. Fee 
referendum fails. 

By Dora Scheidlingcr 
STAFF WRITFR 

With just 17.3 percent of the 
student body voting, almost all 
Student Voice! candidates for the 
A.S. Council's executive positions 
claimed victory in last week's cam-
puswide eJection, ushering in leaders 
that, in most cases, aJready serve 
in the current student gove.rnment 
Vice President External-elect Eddie 
Herrera was the only candidate from 

' the Tritons United! slate, headed by 
Earl Warren College senior Daniel 
Watts, to win a cabinet seat. 

President·elect Harry Khanna 
trumped Watts, in his second con-
secutive year as a presidential con-
tender, by more than 400 votes. Many 
SV! members had similar margins of 
victory in the races for executive 
positions, which oversee the highest 
offices of the A.S. Council. 

Despite SV!'s win, Khanna said 
he does not think the upcoming year 
will be without conflicts, since "peo-
ple on the same slate don't all agree 
with each other.~ 

Watts and his slate primarily ran 
a platform of reform and accused 
Khanna and his slate of corrupting 
student government. 

In the publication called More 
Truth About UCSD, Watts lam-
pooned the SV! slate on many fronts, 

including an allegation that slate sup-
porter aJld former Vice President 
External Kevin Mann misused funds 
for the purchase of novelties. 

"I knew it was going to be an 
uphill race because we were running 
against the establishment," Watts 
said. "There is a political machine 
that A.S. has created. And especially 
in light of the low voter turnout, the 
primary people who turned out were 
the people who support the estab-
lishment:' 

Many of the candidates had no 
previous A.S. experience, which 
Watts said supports his mantra of 
change. Khanna, however, said that 
he also touts change, but will use his 
slate's experience to carry it out. 

. "We promised change, we just 
reinforced that we were going in 
there knowing how to get things 
done, unlike Tritons United!, who 
wanted to go in there knowing noth-
ing.» Khanna said. "While we know 
what the status quo is, we also know 
how to change it.» 

Khanna said that Watts' platform 
was based on mudslinging. 

"His whole campaign was basi-
cally spreading lies about Student 
Voice!,» Khanna said. "I think it 
would have been a closer eJection if 
he hadn't done that and just ran a 
legitimate campaign." 

In More Truth About UCSD, 
Watts published a picture of Khanna 
in his A.S. office, where he served as 
vice president of academic affairs, 
with bottles of alcohol. Those acts, 
Khanna said, are indicative of Watts' 
lowbrow politics. In retrospect, Watts

Academic Freedom 
Discussed at Meeting 

Campus organization Students 
and Scholars Mobilized Against 
Repressive Times hosted an on-
campus conference last week that 
addressed current threats to aca-
demic freedom, student organiza-
tions, diversity and free speech at 
colleges and universities nation-
wide. 

Speakers included professor 
Saree Makdi i, who was named 

as a member of UCLA's "Dirty 
30," a list compi led by a member 
of the Bruin Alumni Association 
that targets professors with sup-
posedly radical views. Members 
of the American Association of 
University Professors, the Arab Anti-
Discrimination Committee and the 
American Federation of Teachers 
also spoke. 

The conference was held 
in response to a bill under con-
sideration by the U.S. House of 
Representatives that would force 
Middle Eastern and other area stud-
ies programs to adhere to special 
regulations under the pretense that 
terrorists could be funding research, 
as well as the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation's recent scrutiny of an 
anti-war group at UC Santa Cruz. 

Settlement Reached in 
WorldCom Case 

The University of California 
reached a $13.25 million set-
tlement earlier this month with 
Citigroup and a former subsidiary 
in a lawsuit stemming from the 
Wor/dCom securities scam. 

The university filed the suit in 
2003, claiming that Citigroup was 
involved with the financial col-
lapse of Wor/dCom and that the 
company damaged shareholders, 
including the university, through 
it massive accounting fraud. 

The university's losses origi-
nally resulted from its purchase 
of 10.2 million Wor/dCom shares 
between 1998 and 2000. Most 
of the purchases occurred before 
Ihe fraud, so the university could 
not join in other class-action suits 
against the company.

UC Task Force Decries 
University Perk Policies 

By Charles Nguyen 
N EWS EDITOR 

Without pointiog to specific 
individuals, a task force exploring 
UC compensation practices came 
down hard on university account-
ability standards last week. 

The group - headed by co-
Chairs Regent Joanne Kozberg and 
former State Assembly Speaker 
Robert Hertzberg - was enlisted 
to scrutinize the university system's 
pay methods, after it doled out more 
than $800 million in undiscloS"ed 
perks to its employees in 2004, 
according to a series of articles by 
the Sail Frallciseo Chronic/e. 

However, university officials 
have disputed the amount of com-
pensation distributed. UC President 
Robert C. Dynes and UC Board of 
Regents Chairman Gerald L. Parsky 
have admitted, however, that the 
university can do better in making 
its pay more transparent. 

The task force hela a teleronfer-
ence last week, when it released the 
report detailing ways that the uni-
versity erred and possible solutions. 

At the conference, the task force 
harshly criticized UC officials' lack 
of adherence to systemWide poli-
cies. 

"It is clear that the current 
situation is wholly unacceptable," 
Hertzberg said. "Neither the execu-
tives nor the board have done all 
they could have done to fulfill their 
responsibilities." 

EnforCing UC policies may be 
difficult, task force members said, as 
there are currently no clear policies 
regarding transparency of compen-
sation. 

"For the university to fulfill its 
responsibilities as a public trust, 
there must be an institutional com-
mitment to public disclosure," the 

task force wrote in its recommenda-
tions to the regents. "This commit-
ment must be codified in disclosure 
policies that are clearly and broadly 
communicated, both internally and 
externally." 

Policies remain confusing, and 
many times conflict with each other, 
Kozberg said. 

The task force's report steered 
away from laying blame on specific 
administrators. 

However, the group did recom-
mend the implementation of a sys-
tem to enforce policies. 

"At the heart of these recommen-
dations, we need to identify a range 
of consequences for violating policy 
... from reprimand to dismissal," 
Parsky said. 

Task force members were ada-
mant about current levels of com-
pensation, and said employees were 
not being overpaid. 

The statement echoed remarks 
made earlier this year by Dynes, 
who said that certain levels of com-
pensation are needed to anract good 
faculty and staff. 

"For UC to best serve the people 
of California, the task force believes 
that tbe university must remain in 
the top tier of the world's research 
universities," the task force wrote. 
"To maintain this level of distinc-
tion, it must be able to provide its 
faculty, administrators and staff a 
level of compensation that is com-
petitive with that offered by univer-
sities in its peer group." 

An independent audit commis-
sioned by the university Will be 
released April 24. 

State auditors are also conduct-
ing an investigation into the system's 
compensation policies.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN NEWS 3 

Herrera Vows to Enforce Morals In Council 
~ ELECTIONS, from page 1 
said that he doesn't regret his actions. 

·We exposed the truth about what 
some people on student government 
had done; Watts said. "Regardless [of . 
whether 1 these people stay in office. 
the students will know what they 
did." 

In total, SV! candidates won 24 
positions, while TU! won 10. Seven 
SV! candidates will become cOWlcii 
senators, who have the only voting 
power on the council, with TU! get-
ting three senate slots. 

Watts said he hopes that TV!'s 
platform of reform will live on 
through the senators and Herrera, 
the lone TV! winner in the executive 
races. 

"Student Voice! does not control 
the senate," Watts said. "There are 
a lot of independeot senators. Plus 
Eddie is up there and he'U be watch-
ing. Harry better get the stuff done 
that he said he was going to do or else 
he'U look kind of ridiculous." 

Herrera won by less than 100 votes 
against SV! oppOnent Porsia Thomas. 
Some of the SV! executives said they 
were nervous about Herrera being 
a mtmber of the cabinet. However, 
Herrera said he was optimistic. 

"I spoke to Harry and I told him 
that at this point, I will do anything in 
my power to get something done and 
do what's best for the student body:' 
Herrera said. ·We're going to get past 
these elections. It's only temporary 
and it's ~ possible for us to pull

At the same time, Herrera said 
that he would not waver when it 
comes to the ethical standards in 
the council He added that his cur-
rent monIs seriously conflict with the 
other incoming executiws.

Expression or Oppression? 
Intolerant Speech Threatens 

Minority Free Expression 
By Ian S. Port 

SENIOR STAFf WRITER 

P retend that you are among the 1 percent of black students at UCSD. As you walk to class one Thursday, a white girl casu -
ally hands you a newspaper displaying, on its 
front p-dge, ~ sloppy caricature of two thick-
lipped black girls eating watermelon in slave 
garb while masturbating each other. Next to 
them, a black man in gangsta gear 
holds two pistols to the head of a man 

others can and cannot say - but, importantly, 
only in certain situations. Seeing the need for 
free speech codes in the university environ -
ment is not eqUivalent to believing that the First 
Amendment is fundamentally flawed - it's 
only understanding that certain environments 
foster an intellectual creativity too valuable to 
let it be threatened by bigoted spew from the 
ignoble basement of human soci.a1 thought. 

While issues of black/white equality 
rarely cull the kind 
of open intolerance 

who appears to be standing behind a 
cash register. Above the picture runs 
a headline reading: "Cocked: A life-
style rag for nappy Niggas and Hos to 
spend welfare money on." Ridiculing 

PRO 
students nowadays 
reserve for gays 
and Muslims, no vio-

your race as being overly fond of fried chicken 
and handgun violence, this imaginary publica-
tion argues that blacks should "be sent back to 
Africa where they can kill each other and save 
our tax dollars." 

Those who oppose barming intolerant state-
ments within the university decry limiting free 
speech just because it hurts people's feelings, 
The First Amendment, they argue, cannot be 
limited for making others feel bad. 

But, as the above example illustrates, the 
kinds of statements that speech codes should 
prohibit - if they were allowed under the 
rules of a university such as UCSD - do much 
more than merely burt people's feelings. Whites 
and other members of general majority groups 
cannot fully comprehend the violence of these 
statements, because they are necessarily igno-
rant of the context in which they are received. 

Consider your imaginary black identity. 
As one of the least -represented minorities on 
campus, you spend m()st of your day around 
students who look differently from you. Not 
only does skin color make you stand out, but 
your life expe.riences vary greatly from those 
you share a classroom with - few know 
anything of racism first-hand, or understand 
in real terms the struggle you may have 
undertaken for the right to .show up at 
UCSDtoday. 

So when you see that newspaper, 
it's not merely offensive. It assaults 
and ridicules every aspect of your 
identity. from the way you look to 
the cultural heritage that defines 
you in every way you know. 
Then the newspaper says that 
you don't have a place here, that 
your culture and that of your 
family and friends is fundamen-
tally inferior and unworthy of 
existence. 

While I generated this imagi-
nary example in a deliberate effort to 
shock, publications trumpeting simi-
larly intolerant views are, as any Koala 
reader knows, well established on this cam-
pus. In 2003, the Koala printed its now-notori-
ous ~Jizzlam" issue, which viciously mocked 
Islam, inciting outrage among campus Muslims 
and phYSically violent backlash against Koala 
members. 

Statements of violence like these, which sin-
gle out specific social groups for public humilia-
tion and assault, are not part of the marketplace 
of ideas that universities should promote - in 
fact, they directly inhibit the school's role as 
a host for reasoned, informed and intelligent 
debate. While contrarian provocation· is ~r­
tainly a valid tool for inteUectual stimulation, 
verbal assault interferes with the ability of stu-
dents to concentrate academically and function 
as productive members of their community. 
Universities intent on maintaining a relaxed, 
productive intellectual environment therefore 
have an obligation to draw a line defming state-
ments of social intolerance as being outside of 
the bounds of appropriate conduct. 

Defining certain words or arguments as 
unacceptably violent, harassing or hateful not 
only halts the rights of people to IlR them, 
it gives rulemakers power to determine what 

lent expression is more 
acceptable than any other. 

Conservative Christians have recently 
been trying out the argument that 
campus tolerance codes limit 
their right to free expression 
by defming their religious 
beliefs as intolerant toward 
homosexuality. The key dif-
ference, they 
say, between 
racial intol-

they decry) and 
their perspective is that 
sexual orientation is volun-
tary' while ethnicity is not. 

Conservative activ-
ists correctly point out that 
equating homosexuality with race puts evangoeli-
cal Christians in the same bin as racists - and 
it scam the heck out of them. But whether or 
not their beliefs are as morally reprehensible as 
racism, they are similar to racism in that they 
assert a basic Inferiority of a fundamental aspect 
of others' identities. 

These kinds of usertions threaten the func-
tion and freedom of the university to IUCh 
an extent that the Fint Amendment Ihould 
be limited to mute them within that preciouI . 
context. The argument of the American Civil

Sac~i(icing Fre'e Speech .for 
JPrinciples' Is a Mistake 

By Vladimir Kogan 
SENIOR STAff WRITER 

Few likely thought of free speech when they read Chancellor Marye Anne Fox's latest reaffirmation of UCSD's 
"Principles of Community." But they certainly 
should have. 

"We affirm the right to freedom of expres-
sion at UCSD; begins one such "prin-

ciple." The next sentence, 
unfortunately, concludes 

justice. 
The biggest danger of speech codes 

like those embodied in the Principles of 
Community is that they erode the speech 
found on the margin, between messages that 
societies already uniformly ban through regu-
lation of libel, obscenity and the like, and 
those that they defend with Voltaire-like zeal. 

Before dismissing this as slippery-
slope, conspiracy-theory drivel, consider 

this: Members of the A.S. 
Council used the Principles

lectually dishonest. After all, how can free

The problem is that offensive speech and 
provocative, constitutionally protected speech 
often overlap; speech codes tip the scale in 
favor of protecting sensibilities, at the expense 
of expresSion. 

Anti-Semitism presents a perfect case study 
of the whole spectrum of ideas. For example, 
few would disagree with German laws that 
ban the Nazi Party; no one, after all, wants 
another Hitler. However, European restric-

tions on Holocaust denial seem iffier. 
And surely, attacks on academic freedom 
by some American Jews - who accuse 

university curriculums of being too critical 
of Israel and too pro-Palestine - attempt to 
cloak a political issue in the guise of ethnic 
sensitivity. 

At the end, though, a ban on anti -Semitic 
speech could be used to justify all three of 
these, resulting in a university commu-

nity - the proverbial "marketplace for 
ideas· - that dOes more to encour-

age conformity than to promote 
critical thinking. 

Indeed, speech codes pro-
vide universities an excuse for 
not doing their job: Teaching 
students how to think, and 
how to separate factS from 
fiction. Instead of outlawing 

the denial of the Holocaust 
outright, let's Simply allow those

cal facts to expose themselves' to

gay bas.hers to speak their mind, 
and see them get laughed off 

of Library WalJt (which happens 
every year). These are the marks of tolerant 
communities, not the rules imposed on their 
members . . 

This, of course, still does not explain why 
society must tolerate the most offensive types 
of expression: Hate speech, like the kind 
spread by the KOllla and the Nazi Party. The 
answer. however, is that hate speech is simply 
the symptom of underlying social tensions, 
and banning their expression does little to fIX 
the problem, 

Hitler did not rise to power because he 
~ a charismatic speaker who fooled the 
people; the populace embraced him because 
hyperinflation, post-WWI embarrsssment 
and other social ills left them vulnerable to 
extremists. Similarly, the current ban on the 
Nazi Party has done little to exterminate neo-
Nazi sentiment in Europe, which has actually 
been rising in recent yean. 

The KOiIla touches raw nerves not because 
of any racist messages it spreads, but because 
these messages reflect UCSn's failure to be a 
welcoming place to students of all colors and 
creedl; banning its publication simply pushes 
these problems to the back of our mind. when 
its ·measages, as offensive as they are, may

or various student movements 
working over the past four 

. years to fight quickly rising 
college fees, the U.S. Constitution 
offers an instructive lesson. 

"Every biU which shall have 

name has bad IItt1e pnctIca1 dI'ect. 
In much the same way, when 

individual UC campuses need more 
money than they can rake in from 
the student-fee levels set by the 
university's Board of Regents, they 

Vladimir 

create new ones. 
Each campus, for 
example, charges 
a flurry of their 
own local fees -
the registration 
fee, controUed at 
UCSD by Vice 

passed the House 
of Representatives 
and the Senate, 
shaU, before it 
become a law, be 
presented to the 
President of the 
United States," 
states Section 7 of 
Article I,laying out 

vkogan@u(sd.edu Chancellor of 

the foundation for the presidential 
veto authority. 

However. just a paragraph. later, 
the document rejoins: "Every order, 
resolution or vote" shall also go to the 
president. 

The reason, of course, is that the 
framers understood incentives: By 
requiring the president to approve 
every "biU,. the rules would simply 
drive the legislative branch to create 
new words to describe their direc-
tives. and argue that these did not 
similarly need presidential consent. 

A quick historical look at UC 
fee policy can be explained in much 
the same way. In 1960, the state's 
much praised Master Plan for Higher 
Education recommended that *the 
University of California shall be 
tuition free to all residents of the 
state." And indeed, it has been. 

The trick, strictly speaking. is that 
none of the fees you pay are "tuition;" 
most of them are the so-called "edu-
cation fee," which is supposecUy much 
different. For students paying the bills 
though, it seems like the change in 

Student Affairs 
Joseph W Watson, being the school's 
biggest. 

When the state cuts funding. and 
administrators can't raise systemwide 
student charges to compensate, they 
simply change the rules, forcing stu-
dents to pay for new buildinp and 
athletic facilities and pawning onto 
student government the responsibil-
ity for funding essential services. 

Which brings me to my sad con-
dusion: No sustained campaign to 
preuure the reaenta into baiting fee 
increaseI will work. The university 
needs & certain amount of money to 
operate. and it will raiIe that money 
no matter what restrictions are 
placed on it; in most circumstances, 
it will find a way of passing the costs 
on to students. 

Over and over apin. the failure 
of student efforts to ~ fees from 
rising makes this clear. Two years 
ago, for eumple, a group of profes-
sional students sued the UC system 
in a class action lawsuit, charging 
that unexpected fee hikes approved 
in response to the state's budget crisis 

represented I breach of contract; ear-
.1Ier this ycu. they actually won, and 
the university was ordered to repay 
millions, 

However, the university's 
response was not to bite the buUet, 
reduce compensation for overpaid 
executives (think: Chancellor Marye 
Anne Fox's undisclosed perks) and 
to tighten its belt; instead, it simply 
introduced a new fee for current 
students, to rep~y the judgment to 
previous ones. 

Given that 

can contribute to the general wealth 
of public knowledge. Both private 
and research funds come with many 
more strings attached. 

Though San Diego Padres owner 
and UC Regent John Moore gives 
handsomely to cancer research, 
he seems to have little interest in 
fighting malaria, for example, even 
though the latter kills many more 
people each year. The result: UCSD 
has the Moores Cancer Center, not a 

Moores Malaria 
Center. Federal 
grants similarly 
satisfy the polit-

ic~ priorities of 
whatever party 
is currently in 
power. 

state funding for 
the university will 
not rise by much 
in the near decade 
and is largely 
unaffected by 
student lobbying 
(no matter what 
the UC Student 
Association 
claims), the other 
consequence of 
fee limits, like 
the ones included 
in Gov. Arnold 
Schwanenegger', 
budget "compect" 
with the state's 
universities, is 
that they drive 
campuses to the 

money no matter 
what restrictions 

are placed on it; in 
most circumstances, 
it will find a way of 

passing the costs on to 
students." 

In the end, 
it's far from 
clear that the 
consequences 
of making pub-
lic universities 
subject to the 
whims of the 
highest bidder 
are better than 
asking students 
to pay more. 

Next year, as 
California's state 

two remaining revenue sources: pri-
vate donations and research grants. 
Though less directly visible, this 
trend has a consequence on not only 
students, but all of society. 

When the state and the students 
give the university money, the sys-
tem can spend the funds largely as 
it sees fit, like hiring professors that 

budget dips 
again into the red, the student -fee 
tango will start apin: The regents 
will propose higher fees, the UCSA 
will protest loudly (and ask for high-
er membership dues, to help "fight 
on behalf of the students") and the 
fees will go up. Unlike the U.S. presi-
dent, you see, students have no effec-
tive veto. 

• PRO, from page 4 
Liberties Union and others that limit-
ing the speech of some limits it for

assaulting statements. Criticism, even 
that informed by cultural differences, '

and cruelly challenges the basic rights

Limiting free speech must never 
be taken lightly. But members of the

the devastation of having one's social 
identity publicly deprecated in what is 
intended to be a rdaxed, creative envi-

they will be wary of doing any other 
illegal things." Watts said. 

As 4:30 p.m. - with half an hour 
after the voting had ended - passed 
and with elections resuJts yet to be 
announced, both slates waited anx-
iously near the A.S. offices for word 
from the elections committee about 
what would happen next. The ten-
sion of the situation was palpable, as 
candidates from SV! gathered on one 
side of the hall and those from TV! 
on the other. 

The committee then announced 
that a formal heari ng wouJd talee 
place on the grievances. After the 
uneasy candidates accumuJated in the 
hearing room. where the opposing 
slates sat directly facing each other. 
the waiting and stressing continued. 

"It was pretty tense in there." 
Khanna said. "A lot of people in there 
were holding their breaths while [the 
elections committee) decided what 
todo." 

After nearly an hour of negotia-
lIons and a 30-minute break, Khanna 
and Watts announced that they had 
dropped the charges against each 
other. 

The sole remaining issue was a for-
mal charge filed by Thurgood Marshall 
College Student Council Chair Denis 
Shmidt. Earlier in the week, Shmidt 
alleged that Watts had printed libel

made an informal written agreement 
that TV! would end campaigning and 
take down Its campaign advertising 
fOur hoon before the poUs dosed. If 
it did not. the agreement dictated that 
the slate wouJd be in violation of an 
official bylaw that forbids making false 
statements to the elections committee. 
When the deadline passed and the TV!

campaign fI}en remained up. Shmidt 
filed a formal gric:vance. 

*In the end, i decided that it was 
absolutely necessary to file the charge 
that I did in order to maintain the 
rules in not only this election. but 
future elections as well," Shmidt said. 

Afte.r hearing a statement by 
Khanna ' - which slammed Watts for 
running a "dishonest" campaign - the 
elections committee heard arguments 

. from Shmidt and Watts. The com-
mittee then deliberated for an hour 
and ruled that TV! had broken the 
agreement violating the bylaw. and 
that sanctions shouJd be imposed. The 
punishments required TU! to outline 
its violations to students on Library

Another Kind of Student Aid 
One group of UCSp students has not forgotten New Orleans' woes after Hurricane Katrina. 

By Nichy Buchanan 
STAFF WRI TER 

I t was spring break, and instead of covering themselves with the strings of Mardi Gras beads a trip to New Orleans screams for , a crew of 60 UCSD students from Campus 
Crusade for Christ prepared to don bulky goggles, 
face masks and knee-high boots to help with 
Hurricane Katrina relief. 

Divided into groups of 10 stu-
dents, each set out to their assigned 
destinations, whether it be food ser-
vice to displaced residents or camp 
volunteers; the gutting of houses, 
schools and churches; or sweating in 
the grueling southern humidity. 

One team headed out to a nine-
room duplex home with dead rats, 
cockroaches and a black, mold -
infested foundation . The house, with 
its fragile frameworks and sorrowful 
past, echoed its story of survival in 
each piece of drywall that was torn 
loose by the crew. 

The owner is a very similar char-
acter. The small, retired 75-year-
old man paid a surprise visit to 
the hardworking volunteers who 
were attempting to breathe life back 
into the place he once called home. 
With a somber tone and hollow 
eyes, he shared his story with them. 
The same pipe that the able-bod-
ied youths struggled to remove just 
hours before his arrival was broken 
by the old man's bare hands the 
day of the flood, after he franti -
ca lly crawled through the attic and 
broke through the glass window. He 
was rescued by a passing boat that 
floated on the 10 feet of water that 
submerged his street and home. 

on to gut the house of all its debris, 
walls, ceilings and nails in the 9· to-5 
workday they were assigned. 

This was only one man's story, and 
a single glimpse into the emotionally 
draining and physically demariding 
journeys that 1,800 college students 
from all over the country experi-
enced during the week of March 25 
to March 30. 

Volunteers were crammed into 
damp warehouses known as "light 
City" near the St. Bernard Parish, 
the region most heavily affected by 
the storm. 

Here, workers found themselves 
thankful for the port-a-potties, 
"mystery meats" served at meals, 
cold showers and firm cots when 
compared to the endless stretch of 
piled debris: children's toys; wedding 
albums cast into the gutters flOwing 
with trash; overturned cars; snapped 
electrical wires; and uprooted trees. 

"The thing that weighed me down 
the most was the desolation," said 
Earl Warten College senior Megan 
Jacks. "I was prepared to see ruined 
homes and harsh living conditions, 
but the fact that you could drive for 
many miles at night and not see a 
single light shining creeped me out. 
It was really forlorn out there:' 

Invigorated by this remarkable, 
real-life account, and now having 
more than just a nameless, face less 
person to labor for, the workers, like 
the majority of volunteers, pressed

Ethanol 

By Katie Wesifall 
STAFF WRITER 

P oliticians, investors, tarm-ers and car companies are turning their heads to ethanol, a renewable energy source produced from corn and the latest fad in the energy 
sector, sprouting excitement and controversy 
alike. Ethanol plants are being built, and already 
existing factories are expanding, A question remains, 
however: Is this alternative biofuel a better option than 
conventional gasoline? 

Answering it has been the task of a group of UCSD 
researchers at the Center for Energy Research. 

The three-man team, composed of professors Forman A. 
Williams and Kal Seshadri, and graduate student Priyank Saxena 
of the mechanical and aerospace engineering department, is developing 
chemical models for ethanol combustion that are Simpler and more usable 
than gasoline. 

These studies will provide practical data to analyze the potential of engines running on 
ethanol and will in tum help to track the production of major paths of pollutants from burning 
the compound. 

The alcohol known as ethanol was used as a fuel in the early 20th century before Prohibition 
criminalized alcohol production, but has recently re-entered the limelight and is now being used 
as a fuel additive. It replaces the anti -knocking agent known as MBTE, which is being phued out 
after it was discovered to pollute groundwater.

How fields of 
corn may hold 
the key -to the 

future's fuel 
source 

I;:thanol is most commonly used in a blend known 
as EIO, which is 10 percent ethanol and 90 percent 

gasoline. However, with the development of "tlex-
fuel" cars specifically built to handle a higher 

amount of the alcohol, the ethanol industry 
is pushing for the use of E85, a mixture of 
85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline. 
Currently, there are about five million of 

these vehicles produced or sold. 
This biofuel is produced from plant 

starch that is transformed into sugar 
and then fermented and can be pro-
duced from corn, sugar cane, hemp or 
other starchy plants. Most ethanol in the 
United States is produced from com. 

The current buzz is about ceUulosic 
ethanol, produced from plant material 
and agricultural waste that is ~ digest-
ib�e by humans, such as switch grass and 

wood chips. It is still too expensive to com-
pete against traditional gasoline. 

Ethanol as a fuel source is therefore renew-
able because it is made from elements that can be 

Many investors are excited about its possibilities. A recent artide in Fortune magazine detailed 
Exxon Mobil's plan to give $100 million to Stanford University to research alternative fuels. Bill 
Gates, among many others, has declared his intention to invest in ethanol-producing companies.

Ethanol Technology May Not 
Be an Attractive Alternative 

• CORN, from page 8 
The v.s. government, however, is 

one of the biggest ethanol supporters, 
and has subsidized the production of 
corn and ethanol. President George W 
Bush has said that he sees ethanol as 
a way to wean America off foreign oil 
dependency. 

"Breakthroughs on this and other 
new technologies will help us reach 
another great goal: to rep1ace more 
than 75 percent of our oil imports 
from the Middle East by 2025; Bush 
said in his State of the Union address 
in January. 

A recent federal bill calls for the 
production of eight billion gallons a 
year of biofuels by 2012. 

The V nited States is not the flrst 
to experiment with alternative fuels. 
and is, in fact. foUowing in the wake of 
countries like Brazil, which has been 
producing ethanol-running cars since 
the late 19705. According to an ethanol 
study conducted by the Solar Energy 
Research Institute, up to 90 percent of 
new cars in Brazil run on pure etha-
nol produced from sugar cane, with 
the remainder running on a blend 
of 20 percent ethanol and 80 percent 
gasoline. 

Although research is not complete, 
the preliminary experiments and com-
putational studies have shown that, in 
some aspects. ethanol is better for the 
environment than gasoline or diesel 
fuels. 

UCSD researchers have found that 
burning ethanol does not produce sul-
fur dioxide and has lower concentra-
tions of nitrous oxide - both of which 
are acid-rain-causing agents. Also, the 
concentrations of soot precursors. ele-
ments that cause unburned carbon 
residue, are found to be lower com-
pared to those produced by conven-
tional fueIs_ 

In other aspects. ethanol has higher 
levels of polluting agents. according to 

UCSD research, such as higher levels 
of aldehydes. which are known to be 
toxic for the environment and can 
cause eye irritation and skin rashes at 
\ow \eveIs. 

Other studies have shown that 
ethanol production uses a signifi-
cant quantity of energy and releases 
many greenhouse gases responsible 
for global warming. discoveries that 
have sparked skepticism over the new 
fuel technology. Tad W. Patzek, a pro-
fessor of geoengineering at Berkeley, 
found that corn ethanol requires 29 
percent more energy to create than 
it produces. 

. However, graduate student Pciyank 
Saxena argues that this is debatable. 
He points to a Solar Energy Research 
Institute finding that ethanol produc-
tion comes remarkably close to break-
ing even on an energy basis. 

Suena also argues that levels of 
greenhouse gases are not higher for 
ethanol produced from plants. Since 
plants intake carbon dioxide for their 
growth, the net carbon dioxide pro-
duction by ethanol fuel is less than 
those by conventional fuels, he said. 

Even beyond t~e controversy. sev-
eral hurdles lie in the path of further 
ethanol utilization, such as a lack of 
gas stations thaI carry the ethanol 
blend due to the higher cost and 
the fewer miles per gallon the fuel 
allows. 

Saxena thinks that these obstacles 
can be overcome and that ethanol is a 
good stepping stone for energy evolu-
tion. 

"Ethanol as an energy source is a 
good interim solution until we are able 
to accomplish hydrogen economy. fuel 
ceUs and cold-fusion technologies; he 
said. 

Williams emphasizes that more 
research needs to be conducted before 
diving into complete ethanol imple-
mentation. 

MONDAY, APRil 17. 2006 THE UCSD GU~RDIAN 

. ·StUdents Awestruck by Hurricane's Aftermath 
• KATRINA, from page 8 
ural disaster in the nation's history, 
it doesn't come dose to doing justice 
to what can be seen with one's own 
eyes. Thurgood Marshall College 
senior Jessica Green described her 
shock at the horrific images of pain 
and destruction she witnessed. 

"When the hurricane first hit, 
it was all over the news, and now 
that it has died out on networks. it 
leads a lot of people to believe that 

- things are near being taken care of, 
but nothing has really been done," 
Green said. "It was much worse than 
I thought it would be." 

It is difficult for those who are 
not in the direct New Orleans area 
to fully grasp the gravity of the prob-
lem that is no longer being reported 
by the media. The thousands of dis-
placed residents, however, are eager 
to talk of their situations. One of 
these residents is a schoolteacher 
named Honeybee, whose home was 
destroyed by an oil spill. 

"I resorted to sleeping on the 
couches of my colleagues until one 
day the reality sunk in that this was 
not a temporary thing. that I needed 
to start over," she said. "This was one 
of the saddest days of my life. I got 
lucky and found an apartment in the 
French Quarter, but ( will never go 
back to my house. It takes a piece of 
you r heart every lime." 

People like Honeybee are also 
more than willing to offer their deep 
appreciation for all of the effor of 
organizations like Campus Crusade, 
Habitat for Humanity, Global Aid 
Network, American Red Cross, the 
Salvation Army and dozens others. 

"( thought my service would go 
unseen as volunteering normal -
ly does,' Marshall junior Morgan 
Vanderpool said. "But we were ser-
vant celebrities in the best way pos-
sible: deeply appreciated by the com -
munity. I had no idea of the mass 
exodus that exists down there." 

Vanderpool also relayed the 
words of a ticket lady at a tui stop: 
"y'alI, all you youths, are doing 
so much more for the people of 
Louisiana than the government has 
ever done." 

• PHOTO COURTESY OF NICKY BUCHANAN 
Starting the day at 9 a.m., student3 walk from "Light Ci4l,' a warehouse at the St. Bemard 
Parish devoted to housing oolunteers. ready to work on a house destroyed by the hurricane. 

Whether the efforts of these com-
passionate youths go by unnoticed is 
of minor importance next to the 
biggest issue of all: Is the govern-
ment noticing this disastrous region 
enough? 

The hurricane hit approximately 
90,000 square miles, and is directly 
affecting 1.5 million people. Ports 
for importing and exporting goods. 
airports, railroads, bridges, roads , 
schools, hospitals and many more 
fundamental institutions were closed 
or ruined in the storm, ultimately 
wiping out the region's commercial 
infrastructure. 

While the Department of 
Homeland Security dedicates (0 
pages on its official Web site to 
detailing the '88 billion of federal 
aid and thousands of federal person-
nel dedicated to relief, recovery and 
rebuilding, it seems very distant and 
unreal to people like the student vol-
unteers who witnessed the residents' 
current state of overwhelming mis-
ery and heard their testimonies. 

"The politicians are spending too 
much time deciding what in the 

part 

world they 'should' do, when ( know 
they are quite aware of what can be 
done to bring their people home,' 
Vanderpool said. 

Marshall senior Morgan Greer 
said he worries about the govern-
ment's response. 

"They could be doing so much 
more," Greer said. "Most of the relief 
effort that I could see at least was 
coming from a lot of volunteers with 
the majority being local Christians 
giving their time and money to help 
in small ways. There definitely isn't 
enough help coming from the gov-
ernment, which is a big problem 
since that should be a major concern 
for government spending." 

It will take many more years, 
many more workers and volunteers, 
billions more dollars and countless 
more tears shed before Louisiana 
and its bordering states can become 
what they once were. 

"My group made two houses 
ready for rebuilding out of the thou-
sands destroyed,' Green said. "And 
yet 1 feel like I have hardly made a 
dent in all that needs to be done."

No. 15 Tritons Falter In 
Overtime Against UCSB 

• OVERTIME, from page 16 
·We ju.t Kept on them and 

attacked every time; Perkins said. 
"Ollr defense was very patient, 
allowing ollr offel)se to leave no 
room for big gaps." 

Hockett attributed the necK-on-
neck playing to the depth of her 
team. I 

"It's great when five, six, seven 
different people get goals; she said. 
"It was definiiely a team effort. If 
one person steps up and scores a 
bunch, it's easy to become depen-
dent on them, but when girls from 
off the bench are coming in and 
scoring just as well, it really livens 
up the team.' 

The third quarter was a con-
tinual game of cat and mouse and 
barely allowed the crowd's eyes a 
moment's rest as the game tied at 
5·5,6·6, and 7-7. 

·We seemed to be in good con-
trol of the second part, but our 
defensive breakdown kept them in 
the game." Perkins said. '"It became 
a matter of not being in the right 
place at the right time and Santa 
Barbara always managed to find any 
space we left open for them." 

UCSD pulled through at the 
last few pivotal moments thanks to 
two goals by Perkins and another 
remarkable score by sophomore 
utility Nicole Hermann with only 
two seconds left in the third quarter, 
to bring the Triton lead to 9·7. 

The seesaw scoring battle trudged 
on all the way through the final 
quarter. Santa Barbara hit the first 
pOint moving to within one at 9-8, 
causing a reactionary goal by UCSD 
sophomore two-meter Judy Emaus 
at the 5:52 mark to bump the Tritons 
back up to 10-8. Shortly after, the 
Gauchos' Lindsay Knott nailed 
another for a close 10-9 Triton lead, 
followed by another UCSD insur-

ance goal by Bajorek to put the 
Tritons at 11 -9 with 4:38 left to go. 
Santa Barbara answered immediate-
ly to squeeze the gap at 11- 10, and 
closed it completely with the game-
tying point by Alaina Whitaker with 
I :51 left in the game. 

Hockett said that games often 
go sour due to overanticipation at 
crunch time. 

"The worst thing is when we 
get nervous and try to force things 
to happen too quickly by making 
rash decisions,' she said. "We should 
really just slow ourselves down and 
stick to the plays we know work." 

Overtime became a painstaking 
process for both teams. In the first 
three minutes, Santa Barbara took 
the initiative with the first goal by 
Sarah Kovach, bringing the score 
to II- 12. Over the next three min-
utes, the Tritons played catch-up, as 
Perkins pounded one in the cage at 
the I :08 mark for another tie and a 
direct pass into sudden-death over-
time. Santa Barbara took a lime-
out to re-evaluate before ending the 
game in victory with a 13th and 

f~goal. 
Even in the midst of defeat, 

UCSD's head coach Larry Sanders 
said he was proud of his team. 

"They stayed composed and 
handled the pressure really well; 
he said. "And they have won quite a 
few dose games just like this. It was 
very competitive, but they never 
gave up and kept fighting and really 
deserved that win. I can't ask for 
more than their best. This just pre-
pares us for the types of games they 
will face in conference. The main 
idea is that they learn, improve, and 
keep moving forward ." 

The Tritons can move forward 
in the rankings in their next game 
against San Diego State University 
on April 20.

VOLLEYBALL 
EARNS FIRST 
WIN IN MPSF 

By Paul Choi 
STAFF WRITER 

After a eason of heartbreak, dis-
appointment and even embarrass-
ment, the UCSD men's volleyball 
team proved its worth in one of the 
toughest conferences in the coun-
try, the Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation, with its first league win 
over tanford IJniversity on April 
14. 

The Tritons, the obvious under-
dogs who have played well in their 
last few games, looked impressive in 
all four games and came away with 
a match vic tory after losing the first 
game, 31 -33, but rebounding to take 
the next three, 30-22, 30-13, '30-24, 
to close out the match. 

"We came out really trong and 
fired up," senior opposite Chris 
Sayers said after the match. "We just 
really stepped up tonight." 

Sayers led the Tritons in the upset 
with 18 kills, 13 digs and six aces. 
Senior outside hitters Mike Reuter 
and Jon Daze also contributed with 
14 and 12 kills, respectively. 

"We really wanted our seniors 
to show us how it's done," head 
coach Kevin Ring said. "And they 
had great games." 

The Tritons held the Cardinal 
to a .157 percentage while hitting 
.370 for the match, and junior set-
ter Brooks Dierdorff passed the ball 
with pinpoint accuracy at over .510 
percent. 

"There was a good energy in the 
crowd," Reuter said. "Brooks had 
a great passing match. He really 
helped us hit welL" 

Game one was a closely fought 
battle, but UCSD looked like the 
better team. The Tritons had two 
opportunities to win the game, but 
could not put Stanford away. The 
Cardinal took the lead, 31 -32, on a 
kill by senior opposite Ben Reddy, 
who had 22 for the match. Stanford 
went on to win the first game on a 
UCSD attack error, 31 -33. 

"We've been playing so well of 
late," Daze said. "Everybody is exe-
cuting better and now we're making 
strings of good plays instead of a 
couple here and there." 

In game two, with the teams 
tied at II - ll , the Tritons took a 
four-point lead with a small run. 
Stanford tried to tie it up, cutting 
the lead in half, but UCSD stayed on 
top, 22- 17, with two Daze aces. The 
Ca rdinal could not gain anymore 
ground, ultimately lOSing on a Daze 
kill, 30-22. 

"It really helped having two of 
our main hitters going at the same 
time and there were a lot of holes 
in the Stanford blocking because of 
that," Sayers said. 

Game three was a display of how 
well the Tritons could playas they 
dominated Stanford , 30-13. UCSD 
started the game with a 13-3 run, 
forcing the Cardinal to call a much-
needed timeout. 

"It would've been great playing 
like this and have half a season left," 
Ring said. "But it's amazing to see 
these guys still want to get better 
this late in the season." 

UCS D held Stanford to -.069 
hitting in game three, which also 
serve,d up 13 aces for the match. 

"Tonight the guys played fabu -
lous," Ring said. "We had a great bal-
ance on offense and service tonight 
was unreal ." 

In game four, UCSD had one. of 
its best hitting games of the season, 
with 19 kills against four errors for a

Gauchos Deal UCSD Crushing Blow In OT 
By Nicky Buchanan 

STAFF WRITER 

A back-and-forth battle between 
two of the top teams in women's 
water polo, No. 12 UC Santa Barbara 
and No. 15 UCSD, ended in heart-
break for the home team, as the vis-
iting Gauchos matched the Tritons 
goal for goal in regulation and 
pulled away for a 13-12 win in sud-
den-death overtime on April 15. 

The Gauchos put down two goals 
at the start, both by Jean Clark, to 
gain a shortlived 2-0 advantage, but 
UCSD's junior two-meter Natalie 
Hockett then started the Triton 
offense, scoring the first goal with 
17 seconds left in the first quarter. 

It was clear early 00 that the 
game would not be pretty. as UC 
Santa Barbara dished out a great 
deal of physical punishment for the 
Tritons. 

"It was like a wrestling matchup 
and down the pool," junior utility 
Michelle Perkins said. 

Hockett also explained that the 
heavy physical playing has not been 
her team's style and that it caused 
serious adjustments in their game-
play. 

"When they grab your face, hold, 
push and kick underwater, we ini-
tially get shocked at times because 
that's not really how we play,» 
Hockett said. "We play smart and 
strategic, but when it comes down to 
it, we just have to step it up and push 
right back at them." 

UCSD managed to continue its 
comeback push with goals by senior 
driver Flynn LaRochelle, junior 
two-meter Sarah Bajorek, junior 
driver Miho Umezawa and senior 
two-meter Kirsten Frazer with 37 
seconds left, giving UCSD a 5-3 
lead. However, the Gauchos retali-
ated with a single goal at the end 
of the second quarter to pull Santa 
Barbara within one.

No. 10 Toros Sweep Triton Softball for Second-Time 
By Lauren Kato 

STAFF WRITER 

Stormy weather put a damper 
on the weekend for the UCSD 
softball team. After a double-
header against No. 6 Cal State 
Bakersfield was canceled due to 
inclement weather on April 14, 
Cal State Dominguez Hills swept 
the Tritons in two games on April 
15. The Tritons fell by scores of 4-
o and 7-1 at home in their second 
sweep of the season at the hands of 
the No. 10 Toros. 

In the first game, Cal State 
Dominguez Hills jumped onto the 
board in ' the top of the second 
inning after a solo home run and 
added two more to its tally in the 
third for a 3-0 lead. 

The Tritons threatened in the 
fourth inning, putting runners on 
second and third with one out, 
but junior second baseman Dallas 
Hernandez and sophomore third 
baseman Jenny Maze both struck 
out winging to st rand the run-
ners. 

UCSD mustered up anoth -
er opportunity late in the sixth 
inning with one out and runners 
on first and third, but two lazy fly 
balls Signaled the end of any offen-
sive comeback in game one. The 
Tritons were shut out after seven 
by a score of 4-0. 

Sophomore pitcher Melissa 
Ward fell to 13-8 on the year after 
giving up 10 hits and four runs. 
Ward did triumph over defend-
ing California Collegiate Athletics 
Association Player of the Year 

Cindy Perry-Brown, holding the 
slugger to only one hit in four 
at-bats. 

"Melissa Ward has done a great 
job this season for us," head coach 
Patti Gerckens said. ·She is really 
keeping the other teams guessing." 

In the second half of the dou-
bleheader, the Tritons responded 
to a 1-0 deficit in the first with 
a RBI double by Maze the next 
inning to tie the game. 

The Tritons kept strong defense 
in the third, as freshman hurler 
Lauren Chastain chalked up back-
to-back strikeouts to put an end to 
the Toro scoring threat, stranding 
two runners on base. 

The Toros responded in the 
fourth, capitalizing on two UCSD 
errors. The defensive falter led to 
five Cal State Dominguez Hills 
runs. 

UCSD could only drum up two 
hits in the rest of the game, while 
Cal State Dominguez Hills racked 
up another run in the fifth to seal 
the win. 

Senior outfielder Jenny Spencer 
played a large role in the Triton 
offensive attempt, acc:ounting for 
two of the six UCSD hits in her three 
at-bats. Prior to the game, Spencer 
and fellow seniors, outfielder Niki 
Anderson and shortstop Desiree 
Franciscus, were honored during the 
Senior Day ceremonies. 

Sophomore pitcher Nicole ' 
Fullerton threw two innings of 
relief to hold back the Toros, allow-
ing only three hits and walking one
