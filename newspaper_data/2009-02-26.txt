The John Muir College and Sixth 
College councils recently approved 
proposals to include student activi-
ty-fee increases on the A.S. Council’s 
general election ballot next quarter.

The Muir College Council’s ref-
erendum would increase the col-
lege’s quarterly student activity fee 
— which currently stands at $7 per 
quarter per student — by $3 in 
the 2009-10 academic year, with an 
additional $2 every five years over 
the next 10 years. The plan would 
cap the student activity fee at $14 
per quarter per person.

MCC Chair Keaton Denlay said 
that in the past, annual events such 
as the Muirstock concert and Muir 
Musical received up to $3,500 each 
in funds from the A.S. Council, but 
that declining support forced MCC 
to propose the referendum. 

“A.S. has been gradually cutting 
funds that used to go toward Muir 
programming in the past few years, 
so [the fee increase] will go toward 
recuperating those funds, and for 
the expansion and betterment of 
Muir organizations and program-
ming,” Denlay said. 

The fee increase would be sub-
jected to the campus’ return-to-
aid policy, under which 29 percent 
of funds collected through such 
increases go to financial-aid schol-
arships and incentives. 

Muir College Dean of Student 
Affairs Patricia Mahaffey said MCC 
decided last year that the college’s 
activity fee must be raised to main-
tain the quality of future events, 
but that the council put the issue 
off until this year in order to con-
centrate on Muir’s 40th anniversary 
celebration.

“When the A.S. [Council] cut 
funding to the [Muir] council, that 
resulted in the [Muir] council hav-
ing to dip into their reserves and 
spend money that they don’t nor-
mally spend,” Mahaffey said. “This 
money has been critical. The coun-
cil needs to go back to Muir stu-
dents and say ‘Can we raise the fees 
by a couple of dollars to provide the 
flexibility we need?’ I think the fee 
increase will provide much-needed 
revenue and funding for our big tra-

ditional events and organizations, 
and for subsidized tickets to events 
like semi-formal and other trips.”

The Sixth College referendum 
proposes to increase the quarterly 
student activity fee — currently at 
$8 per student — to $10, and prom-
ises not to propose any further fee 
hikes until at least fall 2012. 

Sixth College Council Vice Chair 
of Internal Affairs Thach Tran said 
the fee increase was suggested by 
the finance  committee last year to 
compensate for inflation, to avoid 
another budget crisis and to allow 
Sixth College to create annual events 
comparable to those put on by other 
colleges.

“We need to improve and work 
on our programs and events to com-
pete with other colleges … and cre-
ate our own traditions,” Tran said. 

“The fee increase will help us do 
that.”

If the increase is passed, Sixth 
College would have the highest 
activity fee of all six colleges, which 
the council attributes to the fact 
that Sixth has the fewest number of 
enrolled students. 

Both referenda are cur-
rently awaiting approval by Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Penny 
Rue. If approved, the measures 
will be voted on during the second 
week of Spring Quarter via the A.S. 
Council’s general election ballot. In 
order to pass, both referenda must 
see a turnout of at least 15 percent of 
college-specific students and receive 
a majority of affirmative votes.

Sixth, Muir Students to Vote on Fee Increases

By Matthew McArdle
Senior Staff Writer

Campus police detained several 
members of controversial student 
humor newspaper the Koala early 
Monday morning after discovering 
underage drinking in the publication’s 
Student Center Media Lounge space. 
The violation of university policy could 
lead to the organization’s suspension 
from its on-campus location for the 
second time in two years.

Koala Editor in Chief and Earl 
Warren College senior Kris Gregorian 
and three other students were held by 
officers for individual questioning after 
loud noises were heard coming from 
the Media Lounge at approximately 
2:20 a.m. on Feb. 23. Police discovered 
trash bins containing empty beer cans 
as well as an underage student holding 
a half-empty beer, and issued three 
citations for public intoxication, adding 
that they would notify the appropri-
ate administrative officials about the 
violation. 

Gregorian, who was not issued a 
citation, denied responsibility for the 
incident.

“The beers were in the trash when I 
found them,” he said.

According to UCSD police Sgt. 
John Smart, the department has been 
increasing police visibility at night in

National Security Study to Determine 
Future of Prominent UC Nuclear Labs

‘My Vagina Is an Eccentric Tulip’

A federal study is under way this week to 
assess the possibility of moving the University 
of California-managed Lawrence Livermore 
and Los Alamos National Laboratories from the 
Department of Energy to the Department of 
Defense, according to an internal memo from the 
Federal Office of Management and Budget.

The labs — currently co-managed by the uni-
versity and the Department of Energy — are two 
of the nation’s premier nuclear weapons research 
facilities and are aimed at sustaining and improv-
ing the safety, reliability and performance of the 
nation’s nuclear weapons stockpile.

If the results of the study do advise such a 
switch, the laboratories would see a shift from 
civilian to military control by 2011.

According to UC spokesman Chris Harrington, 
it is not yet clear whether a move from the 
Department of Energy to the Department of 
Defense would affect either UC management or 
employees currently employed at either lab.

The Livermore site is one in a trifecta of 
national laboratories that make up the National 
Nuclear Security Administration’s nuclear-

design programs, the other two being the Los 
Alamos National Laboratory and Sandia National 
Laboratories. 

The Livermore lab was founded at the start of 
the Cold War in 1952 and has been co-managed 
by the university ever since. The Los Alamos 
location, founded a decade before Livermore, was 
the birthplace of the first atomic bomb.

Management of the Los Alamos lab opened to 
bids from other vendors in 2003 for the first time; 
in response, the university partnered with private 
companies and won the seven-year contract that 
is currently in place.

While both laboratories are still heav-
ily involved in nuclear security activities, such as 
preventing the proliferation and use of nuclear 
weapons, they have expanded to host such proj-
ects as climate-change research and modernizing 
the nation’s energy infrastructure through nuclear 
fusion projects.

“The University of California has a proud 
tradition of bringing strong science and technol-
ogy to the important work of the Department of 
Energy national laboratories,” Harrington said.

UCSD police released a compos-
ite sketch Wednesday of the man 
who sexually assaulted a female stu-
dent in parking lot 102 near Revelle 
College earlier this month. 

The student reported to campus 
police last week that on the evening 
of Feb. 3 the suspect knocked her 
to the ground as she was locking 

her vehicle, held her down between 
two parked cars and raped her.  The 
suspect was described as an Asian 
male about six feet tall between the 
ages of 18 and 22, and was last seen 
running toward North Torrey Pines 
Road.  

After being named a Churchill 
Scholar by the Winston Churchill 
Foundation, Sixth College senior 
Vikram Juneja will be awarded 
$50,000 to complete a one-year 
graduate program at Cambridge 
University, where he plans to com-
plete a master’s thesis on cancer 
stem-cell research.

Junega, a mechanical engineer-
ing major who has maintained a near 
4.0 GPA during his time as a UCSD 
undergraduate, is the university’s first 
Churchill Scholar recipient and one 
of 14 scholars selected this year from 
a pool of 99 applicants from 63 col-
leges and universities nationwide. 

Laurie Smith, a biology profes-
sor and UCSD representative for 
the scholarship program, nomi-

nated Juneja based on academic 
achievements, which include inten-
sive, 30-hours-a-week research 
on cancer stem-cell biology at 
the UCSD School of Medicine 
and studies with the Instrument 
Development Group at Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography on 
Spray, an autonomous underwater 
glider. 

The UC Board of Regents recent-
ly authorized plans to build a state-
of-the-art research center in which to 
study wine, beer and food.

The facility will include a research 
and teaching winery and the 
August A. Busch III Brewing and 
Food Science Laboratory. Working 
with the UC Davis Robert Mondavi 
Institute for Wine and Food Science, 
it will host scientific research, student 
training and industry collaboration.

Construction on the building — 
which will include a food-processing 
plant, a dairy-processing facility and 
a pilot brewery for the department of 
food science and technology over 

its 34,000 square feet — will be 
completed next year. The winery will 
also house a large experimental fer-
mentation area, controlled tempera-
ture rooms for large-scale testing, 
barrel and bottle cellars, a testing 
lab and a special bottle cellar for 
donated wines. A 12.5 acre teaching 
and research vineyard, along with 
educational gardens, will be located 
outside the winery.

“Our students will be able to 
learn about winemaking using the 
most advanced facility, and learn 
approaches to improve sustainable 
and precision wine production,” 
Andrew Waterhouse, professor and 
chair of the UC Davis department 
of viticulture and enology, said in a 
statement.

Both the winery and the labo-
ratory will be modeled to achieve 
certification in Leadership in Energy 
and Environmental Design through 
the U.S. Green Building Council. The 
winery will be the first in the world to 
include sustainability features such 
as onsite solar power generation, 
rainwater capture and water conser-
vation and carbon dioxide contain-
ment and removal for sequestration.

of Rape Suspect

response to the recent on-campus sex-
ual assault of a female student, which 
occurred in parking lot 102 during the 
early evening hours of Feb. 3.

University Centers, the administra-
tive faction responsible for overseeing 
on-campus space agreements with stu-
dent organizations, specifically prohib-
its the presence of alcohol or drugs in 
student offices.

According to policy guidelines, 
rule violations result in the loss of an 
organization’s space assignment. 

University Centers Director Paul 
Terzino said in an e-mail that he was 
made aware of the incident by cam-
pus police, but would offer no further 
comment before reviewing the official 
incident report, which he said would 
be released today. 

Because of its provocative content, 
the Koala has had historically rocky 
relations with the university over its 
nearly 30 years as a registered stu-
dent organization. The newspaper was 
kicked out of its office two years ago 
after a Student Center employee dis-
covered alcohol and drug parapher-
nalia. Following a lengthy dispute dur-
ing which Koala members handcuffed 
themselves to a couch for nearly a 
week, the newspaper’s office space was 
reassigned; however, the publication 
regained a slot in the Media Lounge at 
the beginning of last academic year.

Warren College freshman Wes 
Field, one of the students issued a cita-
tion, said that if members face eviction, 
they would continue to produce the 
Koala on private computers. 

“Those computers we use right 
now are shitty anyway,” he said.

Due to a recent rape at a Revelle College parking lot, Nancy Wahlig of the Sexual Assault 
Resource Center paid a visit at last 
night’s council meeting to inform 
councilmembers about resources avail-
able for victims of sexual crime.

Lumumba-Zapata Coalition mem-
ber Sam Huang delivered a passionate 
speech on the alleged cancer cluster 
in the Literature Building and pushed 
the council to approve a resolution she 
drafted demanding that the university 
take immediate action to relocate the 
staff and faculty in 
the building, which 
councilmembers 
did not consider.

A s s o c i a t e 
Vice President of 
External Affairs 
Lisa Chen, Arts 
and Humanities Senator Sam Jung and 
Muir College Chair Mabel Tsang gave 
a presentation on the state budget and 
the toll it has and will continue to take 
on higher education, specifically the 
University of California system.

Free-Speech committee mem-
bers James Baldwin and Associate 
Vice President of Local Affairs Erin 
Brodwin then gave the most up-to-
date information on the campus free-
speech policy, which should be com-
plete in a few more weeks.

The council then moved to approve 
a resolution supporting the UC Student 
Association’s College Affordability Act 
of 2009, a measure which calls for a 
five-year freeze on fees for resident 
UC and CSU undergraduate students, 
prevention of future increases from 
surpassing the inflation index and 
raises the income tax by 1 percent for 
millionaires. 

The council also approved a res-
olution for the Sustainable Concept 
Design of phase four of the Wedge that 
was introduced last week.

A.S. Speaker Jordan Taylor would 
not allow the resolution to support all 
affiliates of the Literature Building to 
be added to the new business section 
of the meeting because the language of 
the resolution was not submitted last 
Friday as is required by proper proto-
col. This incited a debate over whether 
or not to overturn the decision.

“This issue [of the alleged cancer 
cluster] has been around for weeks,” 
Sixth College Senator John Cressey 
said. “I do understand that this is time-
ly but I think e-mail traffic would have 

been good on the 
listserv. This [doc-
ument] is timely 
but would have 
been even more so 
last Thursday.”

The speaker’s 
decision was not 

overturned and the council moved on 
to announcements from councilmem-
bers.

All-Campus Senator Chris Westling 
enthusiastically informed the council 
that the Web site for the Save the 
Wedge campaign is now up and run-
ning. The site includes a history of 
the planning and development of the 
four phases of the Wedge, and the 
Sustainable Concept Design proposal 
for the final phase of the project.

Revelle College Senator Brian 
Youm informed the council that the 
search for a new Revelle provost is 
now over, and the new provost will be 
announced next quarter.

Vice President of Finance and 
Resources Naasir Lakhani announced 
that the Grove Caffe will be working 
with the Deejay and Vinylphiles Club 
for a weekly event called DJ Thursdays, 
an initiative to increase student traffic 
and business in Student Center. 

“Let’s all come out and support [the 
Old Student Center] as much as pos-
sible,” Lakhani said.

OPINION
THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 2009

CONTACT THE EDITOR
Alyssa Bereznak 

opinion@ucsdguardian.org

The views expressed herein do not necessarily represent the opinions of the UCSD Guardian, the University of California or Associated Students.

Dear Editor,
Thank you for your coverage of 

the outcry raised by many members 
of the UCSD literature department 
last week. However, I was dismayed 
at the rather flippant and dismissive 
editorial published along with it. In 
attempting to emphasize “the need 
to make transparent all information 
relative to the situation,” the editorial 
board neglected the history of the 
issue, leading it to advance a misguid-
ed opinion regarding our frustration 
and subsequent activism. 

The editorial strongly suggests our 
protest was unwarranted, given that 
“the university is actually doing more 
at this point than at any point up 
until now.” Considering that mem-
bers of the literature department first 
expressed concerns regarding the 
health of the faculty, staff and stu-
dents, and requested an investigation 
into the possible link between this 
and the plant facility five years ago 
(in 2002 and again in 2005), to say 
that the report commissioned by the 
administration last year demonstrates 
evidence that it is indeed “doing 
more,” is hyperbolic and mislead-
ing. Moreover, beyond a superficial 
consideration of how much attention 
the administration is now paying to 
the problem, it strikes me as amaz-
ing that the editorial board did not 
pause to consider what precisely the 
administration has done since the 
publication of the 2008 report — at 
least up to the time of our demonstra-
tion last Tuesday.

How did administrators respond to 
the results of the 2008 report? Did they 
agree to follow the report’s recommen-
dations? They did not. Rather, they 
announced to us in a special meeting 
that, while the health and safety of the 
university’s faculty, staff and students, 
were their “top priorities,” the admin-

istration saw no reason to accept the 
results of the 2008 report as conclu-
sive or authoritative, and immediately 
requested another study. Bear in mind 
that the first report was also com-
missioned by the administration, and 
placed in the hands of an epidemiolo-
gist who the administration praised as 
a top specialist in his field. 

The details of the report are avail-
able online at http://blink.ucsd.edu/go/
EHS-LIT. The questions that fuel the 
exasperation and demoralization of 
many students and faculty who work 
in the building are rather simple: if the 
administration is concerned with our 
immediate health and safety, why are 
we waiting around for more reports? 
Why has there been no attempt to 
either follow the recommendations, 
or relocate us? Consider the following 
analogy: if you are the manager of a 
movie house and your patrons com-
plain that they smell smoke, and that, 
moreover, some patrons are actual-
ly suffering from different forms of 
asphyxiation, what do you do? You 
respond to an emergency with the 
appropriate concern, responsibility 
and leadership. It is this that we are 
asking of the UCSD administration. 
The literature department and its aca-
demic community cannot be made 
responsible for the burden of proof of 
detecting and eliminating the health-
risk factors in the building.

Dear Editor,
In concert with your article about 

the Robotic Einstein personality, I 
wanted to share a similar research 

from our 3-year-old group called 
International Robotics, Inc., in a field 
we have called “Technology-to-People 
Behavioral Psychology.”

The study involves the inter-
relationships between humans and 
machines, employing specially 
designed adult-size interactive pro-
grammable and remote-controllable 
robotic surrogates, which our group 
began to employ as communications 
aids for the learning disabled, socially 
maladjusted, handicapped, autistic and 
emotionally challenged. This research 
began in the early ’70s and has led to 
many unique discoveries in terms of a 
robot’s ability to circumvent the many 
constraints of social protocol, includ-
ing fears, stress, anxieties, suspicions 
and defense mechanisms.

These studies have shown that 
behavior and mannerism are of tan-
tamount importance; even more so 
than an ability to express actual emo-
tions in the physical sense. IRI’s find-
ings have shown that, in the same 
manner a person will imagine the 
visual contents and emotions gener-
ated by reading a well-written book, 
a person interacting with an appro-
priately designed and behaving robot 
will process that robot’s words and 
simple behavior more successfully 
when the robot does not appear to 
physically duplicate the human form 
in its entirety. During the past sev-
eral decades of experimentation with 
all manners of robotic form, it has 
been found that a robot attempting 
to completely and accurately dupli-
cate a human being’s physical appear-
ance will tend to send out a threat-
ening or competitive message. By 
contrast, robots who display simple 
but not entirely human anthropo-
morphic form tend to be more easily 
approached and welcomed by people.

We find that, in more intimate or 
public settings where a fully opera-
tional robot communicates, interacts 
or performs a variety of tasks, a robot 
with reduced levels of human-like 

features is seen as less threatening 
and more approachable by its human 
audiences. Conversely, when such a 
robot mimics human emotions, idio-
syncratic behavior and many of the 
unpredictable factors prevalent in a 
human-to-human interaction, it is 
also received more positively than 
those who behave predictably like a 
machine. There seems therefore to be 
a winning formula prevalent in this 
unique science of human-to-machine 
interface, and this formula appears 
to be a synthesis of very extroverted 
behavior in the embodiment of an 
intentionally nonhuman yet some-
what anthropomorphic robot. We 
have noticed audiences of all sorts 
relish in the opportunity to let down 
their defenses, interacting with less 
concern for acceptance, judgment, 
criticism or even rejection. This 
is especially true when the robot’s 
behavior is compassionate, nonjudg-
mental, loving and able to offer its 
human counterpart its unconditional 
friendship.

In concert with this research, our 
group is also working on biosen-
sor technologies which will someday 
give intelligent machines the ability 
to sense humans’ health signs and 
emotions, thus adding considerably 
to their ability to more accurately 
understand and respond to the com-
plex nuances and intricacies inherent 
in human behavior.

Admin Response to Cancer 
Cluster Still Inadequate

EDITORIAL

As Winter Quarter winds down and the roommate habits we once found cute 
grow increasingly obnoxious, it’s 
important to stop reminiscing about 
our former lives of solitary splendor 
and start perfecting practical solu-
tions to deal with our tiny dorm 
rooms. Living with a complete 
stranger reminds us that sleeping 
naked and toenail chewing aren’t 
very endearing habits. But even 
more, it forces us to take a step back 
and realize we can no longer rely on 

Mommy the maid to clean up our 
messes. Rather, we must work with 
whom — and what — we’re given.

So here are some tips, from my 
own experience as a weathered 
roommate, on how to deal with 
common issues when you are at 
your wit’s end.

First off, those stuck with the 
drowsy-eyed roommate who requires  
16 hours of sleep each night to func-
tion, and who consequently kicks 
you out of your room at 7:30 p.m., 
should consider relocation. Find the 
comfiest couch you can — whether 
it’s in your dorm’s common lounge 
or the nearest Starbucks — and 
claim it as your own. Take refuge in 
these public areas, because with great 
focus, they can easily be transformed 
into your own private study room. 
Pretty soon, uncomfortable passers-
by will stop asking you to move your 
pile of books from the couch, and 
if you make a butt imprint in your 
favorite chair, no one will dare touch 
it. Plus, with an unlimited supply of 
caffeine at your grasp, you might just 
be more efficient. With this compro-
mise, your narcoleptic roomie can 
sleep in peace, while your couch-
conquering prowess will earn you 
some relieving elbow room.

In terms of actual dorm cleanli-
ness, OCD companions are tricky. 
I’ve come home to see my current 
bug-fearing roommate crawling on 
her hands and knees for a full 20 
minutes in search of creepy crawl-
ers in our room’s every crevice. 
Her reluctance to keep our window 
open in fear that bugs might slith-
er through the screen has left our 
room smelling prison-cell rancid. To 
combat mystery scents of any kind, 
ignore your roommate’s complaints 
of security or temperature and bust 
open a window. Basking in a fresh 
breeze should be everyone’s indi-
vidual right, and cannot be sacri-
ficed. During business hours, invest 
in some Febreeze or illegally burn 
some incense. But don’t forget to 
throw your roomie a bone every 
once in a while and help her slow her 
breathing when she mistakes a piece 
of bed lint for a ravaging, disease-
ridden fly. 

As for ridding yourself of 
unwanted noise — deafening music 
and endless phone calls — the best 
policy is honesty. The truth hurts, 
but peace and quiet will only be a 
distant dream unless you remind 
your roommate that not everyone 

Last week A.S. councilmem-bers blocked the Loft from adding a fee referendum to 
their spring ballot, swiftly denying 
students the ability to fund UCSD’s 
infant nightclub, should they so 
choose. The council’s reasoning? 
The A.S. general election is for vot-
ing on A.S. things only; those Loft 
kids can go make their own election 
on the other side of the sandbox. 
You know, people might confuse 
this Loft referendum for another 
A.S. referendum (because there are 
certainly no other instances when 
people vote for multiple measures at 
once). Oh, and because the council 
represents all students — based on 
that strategically maneuvered unop-
posed election, which only a fifth of 
the campus voted in last year — it’s 
totally within the group’s jurisdic-
tion to make decisions regarding the 
future of this well-attended, albeit 
brand new, venue. (Note that this 
meeting took place, appropriately 
enough, over the bumping beats of a 
capacity-filled Loft show.)

And it’s a shame — regardless of 
whether the Loft ultimately deserves 
student funding, students definitely 
deserve the chance to vote on the 
issues affecting them directly. By not 
even allowing this issue to go before 
the student body, councilmembers 
are completely disregarding the best 
interests of their constituents. If the 
council is really concerned with stu-
dent oversight, there is no great-
er oversight than a student vote, 

the language of which had been 
presented by the student-involved 
University Centers Advisory Board 
and was open to council adjust-
ment.

Running a separate election, as 
the council suggested, would be an 
unnecessary waste of funding (the 
council is already going to spend 
a few grand to organize and publi-
cize its election) and energy, given 
that the A.S. election occurs annu-
ally, regardless. In order to provide 
students the most efficient and rel-
evant voting experience — and to 
help overcome a history of low voter 
turnout — councilmembers should 
be doing everything they can to get 

campus issues like Loft funding on 
their spring ballot. 

Forget students, putting the Loft 
referendum to a vote would even be 
in the council’s best interest. In addi-
tion to boosting turnout — think 
how many more students visit, and 
thus care about, the Loft than its 
upstairs  neighbor the A.S. Forum — 
a reasonable ($3.29 was proposed) 
fee referendum would allow the A.S. 
programming office to gauge student 
interest in the space it has largely 
utilized for events this year.

There is absolutely no reason stu-
dents shouldn’t be voting on a Loft 
fee referendum come spring, and this 
council’s egoism is getting old.

The next time you’re at your desk, 
desperately trying to finish a paper 
and the only way you can think to 
complete a sentence on heteronor-
mativity is to comply with Beyoncé’s 
demand to “put a ring on it,” don’t be 
afraid to say something. Suggesting 
headphones, or  relocation altogeth-
er isn’t rude — it’s necessary to your 
sanity. Remember, you are paying 
for half of that room. Demanding 
your right to silence is OK. This 
straightforward solution may be 
intimidating, but when you turn in 
your paper the next day without any 

references to Leona Lewis, you’ll be 
patting yourself on the back. 

For most, stepping out of bed 
onto a slew of dirty laundry is near-

of moldy, three-week old milk in 
your fridge. Address this situation by 
swallowing your ego and becoming 
the maid. Do weekly fridge clean-

rest of your energy into keeping your 
side neat because as tempting as it 
may be, ignoring the mess as a silent 
form of protest will only add to your

half-empty packages of turkey on her

pop up often while sharing such 
a small area. But with my sugges-

I have not been blessed with the 
ideal roomie, I have learned to put 
away the complaints and bust out the 
big guns. Not only has my building

Transform Summer into Success

By Alyssa Bereznak

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 
— It’s budget season, and this week-
end 35 UCSD student delegates will 
travel to the University of California 
Student Association’s annual Student 
Lobby Conference in Sacramento to 
rally for the College Affordability 
Act — a five-year fixed tuition plan 
that would be included in the Nov. 
2009 general election.

It’s no doubt that the University 
of California’s funding has endured 
quite the beating this year, and 
the College Affordability Act — a 
proposal that would freeze tuition 
for undergraduate students at 
the University of California and 
California State University — is 
a tempting opportunity to stop 
increases in student fees for the next 
five years. Not only would students 
finally stop worrying about creep-
ing increases as scholarships and aid 
seem to dissolve before their eyes, 
the proposal would also limit fee 
increases to no more than the annual 
percentage change in the California 
Consumer Price Index. It all sounds 
too simple. And it is.

In terms of fiscal aid, the act 
would earn revenue by implement-
ing a 1 percent tax on incomes 
exceeding $1 million. Sixty percent 
of this tax — roughly $1.2 billion 
— would go toward the University 
of California and California State 
University systems and the remain-
ing 40 percent would be available 
for general state purposes. The $1.2 
billion would then be split evenly 
between the two state systems so 
that the University of California 
would receive $60 million annu-
ally to distribute to its 10 campuses. 
That makes $6 million for each one.

Ignoring the fact that this act 
would throw another financial bur-
den onto the back of the same citi-
zens whose taxes already solely fund 
our state’s mental health services 
program, it’s likely that — consider-
ing each campuses’ current infra-
structure — a mere $6 million per 
year would leave little flexibility to 
maintain existing programs and 
confront urgent financial issues. 

For the 2007-08 academic year, 
UCSD’s resident undergraduate fees 
were $8,062 per student — only a 
fraction of the approximate $23,000 in 
total cost to attend college. And while 
fee increases during our current bud-
get crunch shouldn’t be taken lightly, 
simply forcing an umbrella freeze on 
each campus and offering a set sum 
for current programs and emergen-
cies overlooks both the individual 
needs of each UC campus and limits 
their ability to tailor their budgets 
themselves. That doesn’t necessarily 
mean that each campus should allow 
for over $6 million in fee increases 
each year, rather, they should care-
fully consider what’s necessary to sus-
tain already-existing programs that 
enrich the college experience.

 The good news: Because the UC 
Board of Regents is bound by the 
State Constitution — not the statute 
— it could reject the fee freeze by 
resolution and pass the entire $1.2 
billion on to the California State 
University. If the UC regents want 
some elbow room to realistically 
maintain the programs that make 
the University of California such a 
successful institution and deal with 
unforeseen financial disasters (which 
seem to be quite common lately) they 
should do just that.

RA RA RIOT
By Simone Wilson
Senior Staff Writer

P lanets rarely align as effortlessly as they did in 2006, over the haloed curls of preppy private-college rockers Ra Ra Riot, who 
had hardly put in half their requisite house-party 
hours and self-released a snappy little EP before 
being recruited for the CMJ Music Festival and 
rocketing to new-generation stardom — mostly 
by cyberword of their killer live show — a clan of 
smart, happy-sad little siblings in the footsteps of 
blog-hype heroes like Clap Your Hands Say Yeah. 

Wait — wasn’t that Vampire Weekend? 
Admittedly, it’s hard to find anything immedi-
ately remarkable about the East Coast fivesome 
that couldn’t be found in the four-car-garage 
jam sessions of their squeaky-clean indie-
pop brethren. (Though many would dis-
agree; say, hyperbolic buzz-hound Spin 
magazine, which — resorting to scare 
tactics in a jaded new world that crawls 
with far too many so-so bands to care 
much about any of them — initially 
hailed Ra Ra Riot “one of the best 
young bands we’ve heard in a really 
long time.” And claimed their “Each 
Year” to be “a song you’ll undoubt-
edly listen to about 37 times during 
the first 24 hours the EP is in your 
possession, chills invariably coursing 
up your spine as the first cello swells 

stumble out of the silence.” Then again, if you did 
force that many listens, I can’t say you wouldn’t be 
a little addicted.)

Even the band name resembles a Rapture out-
take, at best — cute, yes, but slipping through the 
cracks with all the attention-whoring Go! Teams, 
Hot Hot Heats and Yeah Yeah Yeahs of the world. 
Thanks to this somewhat nondescript likeability 
— and despite the manic fandom of paid-off 
critics — when longtime pals Vampire Weekend 
dynamited the scene in all their mop-topped 
fab-fourness, leaving the hipster hordes crap-
ping their pants like 12-year-old girls at the 

“Help!” concert, Riot avoided household-name-
dom by sort of just chilling behind the curtain, 
finger-painting with the mellowed confidence 
of later Beatles, opting out of direct prep-school 
references and Graceland rip-offs to explore the 
vaguer, slower corners of life and love. 

It’s not that they don’t have the potential 
for that instantly desirable, sarcastic cockiness 
that sets their overshadowing counterband apart 
— in fact, Vampire Weekend keyboardist/gui-
tarist/singer/producer Rostam Batmanglij and 
Riot frontman Wes Miles have ping-ponged 
riffs and brainstormed across genres since their 
playground days, and currently record together 
as Discover — they’re just feeling a little more 
melancholy today. Thus, the pair of co-ed hot-
ties — definitely the Ra and Ra of the opera-
tion — commissioned to sex up business-as-

usual on a violin and see-through electric 
cello, very calculatedly lending the band 

that churning Arcade Fire drama (so 
much more sincere when classically 

trained females are present).
Plus, they have a reason to 

be sad — debut album The 
Rhumb Line is dedicated to 
late principal member John 
Pike, who tragically drowned 

right before the band’s big break. 
Those tracks not co-written by 
Pike are equally touched by his

“Beautiful Losers”

In an offbeat tale of the 
artistically dispossessed, 
“Beautiful Losers” celebrates the creative spirit 
of our generation’s underground movements. The 
documentary is a collective portrait of imaginative 
outsiders who have propelled the art scene for 
years. Following the likes of Harmony Korine, Mike 
Mills, Ed Templeton, Shepard Fairey and Cheryl

an early ’90s milieu scored with quirk, crafts 
and a streetwise brand of politics that collects 
its due homage in this San Diego

W hen “Sin City” hit theaters four years ago — sending sycophants into caps-lock, fan-blogging glee — it 
was on the lithe heels of “Spider-Man,” 
a summer gangbuster that saw studios 
rushing pell-mell to patent every superhero 
they could seize. But while Spidey waxed 
epic with young love, tragedy in the 
family and Kirsten Dunst’s ginger tresses, 
Robert Rodriguez and creator Frank 
Miller conjugated the graphic novel with a 
different accent, focusing less on the action 
hero and more on the antihero’s aura of 
homicidal cool.

Since then, it seems we’ve been 
inundated by an endless font of 
adolescent pulp, streamlining sanguine-
chic reproductions (not interpretations, 
mind you) and storyboarding the same 
flat “characters” with intolerably faddish 
appeal. And this year’s lot isn’t looking any 
more nuanced.

“The Watchmen,” billed as the golden 
bough of comic fandom and Alan Moore’s 
wizardly genius (he’s worked on everything 
from the D.C. pantheon to self-published 
explorations of murder and eroticism), is 
one of the year’s most anticipated films, 
and understandably so — especially now 
that Fox has settled its bout with Warner 
Bros. However, “Watchmen,” for all the 
purported brilliance it reams as a graphic 
novel, will probably brandish the same 
self-indulgent, hollow amusement as its 
predecessors (epitomized by “300” director 
Zack Snyder’s kitschy filmography).

After all, slapping comic books onto the 
big screen, virtually panel for panel — with 
added slow-mo effects, bloated aesthetics 
and stretched CGI wallpapers — hardly 
seems the point of adapting a screenplay. 
Still, it’s been in vogue among a mostly 
male demographic for quite some time 
now.

In the ’80s, when Reaganite nostalgia 
for a morally upright small-town hero 
was in demand, Clark Kent sprung into 
live action to become one of the first

SINFUL LOWS

By Leila Haghighat
Staff Writer

P remiering at the Mandell Weiss Theatre and set to the head-splicing staccato of the French Revolution’s guillotine, George 
Büchner’s “Danton’s Death” sees undergraduate 
and graduate actors tackle the operatic scope 
of a 200-year-old work — under the direction 
of Dominique Serrand, Quinn Martin Chair in 
Drama — halting too often for the fermatas of 
long-winded monologues in attempting to cap-
ture the despair of political upheaval. Straddling 
eras, the drama ponders 20th century existential-
ism in the metaphoric Elizabethan language of 
Shakespeare, befuddled with the mysteries of 
humanity and never quite gripping the terrors of 
homicidal revolution — offering instead a two-
and-a-half-hour-long reign of stupor. 

“Death” smacks audiences down in medi-
as res, opening on a quarrel among members 
of the Committee of Public Safety in the heat-
ed aftermath of King Louis XVI’s execution: 
The committee, which had initially banded to 
protest aristocratic extravagance, experiences 
a sudden civil rift. 

Danton (Bowman Wright), a nonconformist 
who heads the committee’s liberal faction and 
generally indulges in “what gives him pleasure”  
(heavy drinking and the carnal pleasures of 
whorehouses), resigns support for the guillotine 
after realizing that “the Revolution devours its 
own children.” 

But despite Danton’s empathetic appeals, his 
adversary — Robespierre (Ross Crain), who 
governs the committee’s opposing faction with 
staunch conservatism — is preoccupied with 
creating a Republic of Virtue. For the adamant 
technocrat, “the social revolution isn’t finished. 
Anybody who goes only halfway with a revolu-
tion digs his own grave.” Robespierre sentences 
Danton to death, convinced that the degenerate 
class of political dissenters must be duly pun-
ished. 

Tugging at the traditional yarns of storytell-
ing, Danton’s wife Julie (Sara Garcia) and that of 
his confidant, Lucille (Maren Bush), add roman-
tic confusion to the play’s melange of genres, des-
perately pleading their husbands to forfeit their 
resistance against the bloodthirsty Robespierre.

POLITICAL FERVOR BREAKS A SWEAT IN TEDIOUS ‘DEATH’



THURSDAY,ÊFEBRUARYÊ26,Ê2009Ê THEÊUCSDÊGUARDIANÊ HIATUSÊÊ7

passing (“I wouldn’t like death if death were good/ Not even if 
death were good”), recorded in pastoral backcountry New Jersey 
with nothing but a scene-making filly to kink the flow.

But those pretty, skittery dreams of an African beat are always 
there, keeping the Rioters highly ranked in their genre-circle of 
studied youngsters and making it damn near impossible not to 
hop along. “House parties were so fun because the audience wasn’t 
really critical at all. They were purely there to have a good time,” 
violinist Rebecca Zeller said. “For a new audience member, as 
opposed to a partygoer, they just seem to kind of stand there and 
watch.” So try not to judge these newcomers too hard, perhaps 
pretending for a moment that the Loft is a dorm-room den at 
your East Coast reach school and keeping an ear out for that dar-
ing music-box Kate Bush cover — ’cause Vampire Weekend would 
have never done that.

Ra Ra Riot will perform live at the Loft on March 1 at 8 p.m.

In tangential, Aristotelian musings, “Death” departs from its 
political underpinnings with scatterbrained aesthetics that only 
further entangle a muddled narrative. Taking up half the stage, a 
makeshift pit prevents close interaction between characters — per-
haps reflecting their escalating emotional and political distance, 
but more likely a judgment slip by overambitious set designers. 
Unintentionally, the pit requires characters to march sternly around 
its expanses (as if storming the Bastille wasn’t hard enough), failing 
to complement the realism of the play’s harsh political context. If 
not for the imitation culottes, nothing on stage would connote a 
French milieu.

The play opens with only a projection screen, phrases of 
political turmoil emerging there from a scrambled paragraph. The 
screen then lifts to reveal a trippy and mountainous arrangement 
of wooden chairs on stage left — the legs of some jutting across, 
atop and beneath the backs of others. But — like the impetus for 
Robespierre’s ornery despotism — the play glosses ever so glibly 
over the reasoning behind this surrealist eyesore.

Deft lighting casts shadows eerily over the set’s backdrop, creat-
ing a stark contrast that momentarily salvages the play’s artistic 
merit. But the transient brilliance soon capitulates to histrionic 
sound bites: Opera clips signal the end of emotive scenes, the pious 
gloom of hymns like “Donna Nobis Pacem” awkwardly jolting a 
heavy-lidded audience.

The personification of Liberty (Bianca Harlow) as a silent omni-
presence, one of the play’s greatest stabs at symbolic depth, proves 
brilliant in its irony — that a woman clad in African tribal garb can 
represent ultimate freedom. 

Lost in its own gaucherie, “Death” desperately clings to the puns 
and tropes of Shakespearean classics. Here, the hamartia of Danton, 
Büchner’s tragic hero, lies in his sloth and indecision. The Hamlet 
allusion resurfaces when a newly emo Robespierre, self-alienated 
from the fresh wave of bourgeois, mourns: “Everything is empty 
and desolate. I am alone.” 

Robespierre then turns into Lady Macbeth, guiltily rebuffing 
Danton’s accusation: “It doesn’t matter how many rags I wrap 
around it — the blood seeps through.” Before the words “Out, 
damned spot!” leak, he harkens “The Tempest,” comparing life to 
reverie: “Are we only sleepwalkers? Isn’t our life like a dream?”

For Büchner, too, all the world’s a stage — characters repeatedly 
iterate the scarcity of free will in their marionette-strung lives, for-
ever at the mercy of some intangible force. 

But “Death” lacks the Bard’s sophistication. Its frequent squab-
bles demand extensive political know-how, leaving us scrambling to 
comprehend the drama’s impossibly antiquated discourse. The play 
approaches us with the double intent of demystifying the enigmas 
of humanity and recapitulating the Reign of Terror a la SparkNotes. 
And, in a way, it does — we experience confusion akin to the French 
Revolution’s own bewildered peasantry. C’est la guerre!

MINIMALIST SET CLASHES WITH SHAKESPEARIAN DOPPLEGANGER

COURTESYÊOFÊMANNYÊROTENBERG

Graphic-Novel Knockoffs OD on Big-Budget Steroids
Americana icons. And while it took nearly another decade, Tim 
Burton’s nocturnal caped crusader followed suit. For all their 
costumed theatrics and cartoonish villainy, both “Superman” 
and “Batman” attempted to make some sort of commentary on 
the escapist worlds their heroes inhabited, all the while scoring 
profitable celluloid debuts to boot.

Of course, money-hungry studios at their imperial Cold War 
prime managed to ruin a good thing, resurrecting increasingly 
campy, zombified sequels to the first films and expunging any 
socio-significance they once retained.

All bitterness aside, translating comic-book art into film is 
nothing ingeniously fresh-faced to the current millennium — or 
to American independent cinema, for that matter. Terry Zwigoff ’s 
catatonic “Ghost World” (featuring a laconic and relatively green 
Scarlett Johansson) and the sublimely crotchety Paul Giamatti in 
“American Splendor” both pulled it off skillfully, faring well at 
the vanity fair of festivals worldwide. Even this year’s Academy 
Awards featured an Israeli foreign-language nomination (“Waltz 
With Bashir”) that hoped to win — as at the Golden Globes — by 

whetting our craving for post-traumatic surrealism. 
“Sin City” and “300” — the collaborative efforts of Frank 

Miller and acolytes — were emblematic of comic-book cinema 
at its pits: digitally blown in proportion to their egotism and 
pieced together with picaresque hijinks. And whether angling 
for moral ambiguity in hooker heaven or vilifying effeminate 
Persian emperors, they measured out hyper-macho violence by 
the ton. 

Anyone remotely chaffed by now is probably thinking that 
films of this sort aren’t meant to be taken so seriously — that such 
creativity should be a welcomed change in a sea of big-budget 
blase. That the graphic heavyweights are justified in their kinetic 
energy, entertainment value and visual exuberance. But — while 
they certainly master new levels of technical and imaginative 
clutch — it all comes at the invaluable cost of an over-the-top 
aesthetic that obstructs any life-giving significance.

Though “Watchmen” certainly won’t be the worst of recent 
attempts (cough, “The Hulk”), it’s in the same sullied vein 
that’s swiftly retrogressing action-adventure into an immature 
reinforcement of “cool” — so feel free to leave your brain at home.

The Appleseed Cast
■ Sagarmatha
MILITIA

It’s hard to say whether Kansan rock ‘n’ rollers the Appleseed Cast were they inspired by Sagarmatha, Amsterdam — kingdom of high-quality cannabis — or 
Sagarmatha, Mount Everest — the Nepalese name for 
highest peak in the world — when naming their latest LP. 
Either way, the definitively post-rock album smokes up the 
sky, graduating the band from stale emo stylings to soaring 
instrumental highs. Taking cues from their atmospheric 
colleagues, Sagarmatha rises above verse-chorus pairings 
to mist through staggering vocals and light-struck guitars 
and find a solid face in experimental rock.

On 1999’s Mare Vitalis, the boys captured the ocean — 
now, they’ve brought home the rainbow. The trip begins 
in moody, glorious sonic shafts on “As The Little Things 
Go,” an 8:15 tribute to California soul. Filled with driving 
oceanic drafts and sweeping Santa Anas, its silvery 
Coldplay echoes explode midway into epic battlefield 
beats, soft Killers whispers, grinding rock feedback and 
a spine-tingling fade for proper release. The boys almost 

get drunk on it, raising the resurrected guitar on “The 
Road West” high over quavering strings and soul-pulling 
drums. This kind of heaviness is a new acquaintance 
to the Cast. They’re sweeped in foglike thickness, then 
broken with sudden floating interruptions of sunlit keys. 
“Raise The Sails” then opens the sky for good, clashing 
screams from the drumset with easy, deep-throated 
chords. 

Though they sometimes face the post-rock noise 
problem — tracks melting into tedium — plaguing 
L.A. acts like El Ten Eleven and Beware of Safety on 
the same heartbeat drums, holy trembling guitar and 
3D hallucinations (any variations mostly derived from 
mainstream metal, dance or pop tricks), the Appleseed 
Cast go beyond beautiful, exposing the soil beneath the 
snow and heralding a new spring.

N.A.S.A.
■ Spirit of Apollo
ANTI-

Though the immensity of five-year, 40-guest Spirit of Apollo rivals that of the actual space program, N.A.S.A. pair Squeak E. Clean and DJ Zegon prove 
their chain of musical relativity is only as strong as its 
weakest link: them.

Operating under a unite-the-world manifesto (pro-
claimed with first-year-art-student vigor over an album-
starting swarm of mechanical junebugs and intellectually 
sparse xylophone), the duo abandons context in a genre 
founded on locality, pasting rhymes gleaned from North 
America’s wildest hitmakers over an artificial smattering of 
South American instrumentals,  all the while preoccupied 
with a cosmos sub-obsession that Kool Keith’s space raps 
don’t help.

Standouts Fatlip, E-40 and Method Man loan the proj-

ect enough listenability to cover the cheap mixes beneath; 
but most guests get caught in the ultimately boring hiplash 
caused by this concept album’s lack thereof; and many 
remain hideously squandered, glued indiscriminately onto 
N.A.S.A.’s my-first-keyboard beats. We’re left wondering 
how Clean and Zegon ever convinced so many all-stars 
to join their roster. Whatever their method, it set moving 
a self-perpetuating bandwagon that has spiraled so out of 
control no one wants to be left out — too bad they’re way 
better at dropping names than dropping beats.

N.A.S.A. will perform live at the Casbah tonight, Feb. 26, 
at 8:30 p.m.

as the Cougars opened up to an early 
10-5 lead. After the Tritons closed the 
margin on a junior opposite hitter 
Jason Spangler kill at 12-11, BYU went 
on a 6-0 run to take an overpowering 
18-11 lead. The Cougars would go on 
cruise control for a 30-18 win in the 
second set. 

The third set was also controlled 
by BYU after the Cougars jumped 
out to a 15-8 lead, forcing a Triton 
timeout. BYU continued its tear and 
finished the sweep of UCSD with a 
decisive 30-17 victory.

On Friday night, the Tritons were 
held to a measly .071 hitting as BYU 
controlled each set.

BYU set the tone of the night in 
the first set, surging to an early 20-
13 lead. UCSD then stormed back 
behind Fritsch to cut the lead by two 

points, at 24-22. After a score of 26-
24, BYU closed the door, scoring the 
last four points and winning 30-24. 
The Cougars controlled the entire 
second set, eventually taking it by a 
score of 30-22.

BYU once again jumped out to 
an early lead in the third set, but 
UCSD came back to put up a fight. 
The Tritons took only their second 
lead of the night after consecutive 
block assists from redshirt sophomore 
middle back Adrian Guthals and 
Ehrman for a 15-14 lead. However, 
more of the same took place after a 
scorching BYU offense went on an 8-1 
tear after trailing 18-17. The Cougars 
swept the Tritons and sealed the third 
set with a 30-21 win. 

Fritsch led the Triton attack with 
16 kills on .345 hitting, with eight of 
the kills coming in the first set. Kent 

Tuttle, who had 12 kills, led BYU.
After back-to-back sweeps at the 

hands of the Cougars, UCSD must get 
back on track in MPSF play to solidify 
a playoff spot. After eight straight 
games on the road, the Tritons will 
finally return home to RIMAC to host 
MPSF powerhouses UC Irvine, UCLA, 
University of Southern California, 
Pepperdine University and University 
of Hawaii in consecutive matches. 

“We are very excited to finally 
be returning to play in RIMAC,” 
Leserman said. “Our matches this 
week against UC Irvine and UCLA 
are both going to be tough, but if we 
put together a solid game there is a 
great chance for a UCSD victory or 
two.”

at ctillisc@ucsd.edu.

man Shea Kopp, freshman Mercedes 
O’Brien, sophomore Jessica Ferguson 
and senior captain Aubrey Panis, the 
relay team set the Tritons’ tempo for 
the rest of the meet.

“It was a really close meet and 
we did a great job of pulling it off,” 
Panis said. “We didn’t know for sure 
what the result would be until the 
very end of the last heat, so we were 
all very tense.”

The top UCSD women’s finish-
es belonged to freshman butterfly 
specialist Alexandra Henley, who 
took second place in the 200-yard 
individual medley with a time of 
2:05.91, first place in the 400-yard 
individual medley with a time of 
4:25.87, participated in the 400-yard 
individual medley relay which took 
first place with a time of 3:50.98 and 
set a meet record in the 200-yard 
backstroke with a time of 2:01.82. 
Senior breaststroke specialist 
Kendall Bohn also had a remarkable 
meet, placing first in the 100-yard 
breaststroke with a time of 1:03.54 
and in the 200-yard breaststroke 
with a time of 2:16.22. UCSD swept 
the 200-yard race with O’Brien tak-
ing second and junior breaststroke 
specialist Carianne Cunningham 
placing third. 

The 400-yard individual medley 
relay team of Henley, Bohn, junior 
butterfly specialist Karla Holman 

and senior captain Shannon Simonds 
also took first place, with a time of 
3:50.98.

“Our girls really showed they 
could handle the pressure in a close 
meet,” McGihon said. “It’s good for 
them and it will help prepare us for 
nationals.”

Sophomore backstroke special-
ist Anju Shimura missed the meet 
because she was battling the flu. 
Despite the star’s absence, the team 
showcased its depth by prevailing 
against the odds. 

On the men’s team, top honors 
belonged to senior individual med-
ley specialist Knief Lohse, who took 
first place in the 500-yard freestyle 
with a time of 4:30.56 and first place 
in the 200-yard freestyle with a time 
of 1:39.57. Senior captain Daniel 
Perdew also blew away competition 
in the final conference meet of his 
collegiate career, taking second in 
the 100-yard butterfly with a time of 
50.13, first in the 50-yard freestyle 
with a time of 20.47 and first in the 
100-yard freestyle with a time of 
45.26. The men’s 200-yard medley 
relay team, led by senior captain 
Steve Hardy, junior Juan Carrillo, 
Perdew and junior Todd Langland, 
took second place with a time of 
1:31.17 — another great accom-
plishment for the biggest meet of 
the year. 

The men’s 800-yard freestyle 

relay team took second place, with 
a time of 6:45.76 led by freshman 
Brandon Maryatt, Langland, fresh-
man Michael Lorch and Lohse. 
The 200-yard freestyle relay team 
of freshman Sam Stromberg, Todd 
Langland, freshman Blake Langland 
and Perdew finished first with a 
time of 1:22.10. The Tritons closed 
out a terrific meet that was effec-
tively locked by Thursday night with 
a second place finish in the 400-yard 
freestyle relay.

“We really wanted to beat those 
guys,” Perdew said of UCSD’s con-
ference opponents. “We lost last 
year to them by such a short margin 
so we just wanted to come and blow 
them away.”

With the women’s team being 
the stronger squad during most of 
the regular season, the results were 
slightly unexpected.

“I thought our guys would have 
a pretty close meet and the girls 
would run away with it, but this just 
goes to show how deep of a team we 
are and how we can really compete,” 
McGihon said.

The Tritons will take some much-
needed rest after this meet before 
traveling to the NCAA Division-II 
finals in Houston, Texas, on March 
11.

ter, entering halftime trailing 9-5. 
The difference proved too much for 
the Tritons to overcome, falling to 
Loyola Marymount by a final score 
of 14-8. Senior attacker Sydney 
Gstettenbauer’s five goals were not 
enough to lead UCSD to victory 
over the Lions. 

“We had some tough games this 

weekend, but it was a great experi-
ence for our team that can only help 
us down to the road to winning 
conference,” junior utility Stephanie 
Bocian said.

Despite the four tournament 
losses, Sanders said the Tritons 
showed improvement from their 
early season play.

“We just played two games that I 

think we could have won,” Sanders 
said.

The Tritons next compete against

SWIMMING & DIVING — With 
a spectacular 2008-09 campaign 
already on the books, the UCSD 
men’s and women’s swimming 
and diving teams capped off their 
respective seasons with victories at 
the Pacific Coast Swimming and 
Diving conference championships 
last week in Long Beach. The event 
started on Feb. 18 and ended on 
Feb. 21, and featured teams from 
across the Pacific Coast, ranging 
from University of Alaska-Fairbanks 
and Seattle University all the way 
down to UCSD. The men’s team 
completely obliterated the compe-
tition with a total of 1,561 points 
— over 400 more than second-place 

UC Santa Cruz. The women’s team 
did not win as definitively, earning 
1,403 points; just 20 points over 
rival Loyola Marymount University. 
Despite tough competition from the 
Lions, the Triton women took first 
place in the tournament and will be 
sending 14 swimmers to nationals 
— a program record — along with 
11 swimmers from the men’s team.

“We’re pretty excited,” head 
coach Scott McGihon said. “We 
didn’t really expect the meet to turn 
out like this.”

VOLLEYBALL — The UCSD men’s 
volleyball team (7-6 overall, 5-3 
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) 
got back into action this weekend 
while taking on the No. 9 Brigham 
Young University Cougars in Provo, 
Utah. Looking to carry their recent 
success into league play against a team 
they had never previously beaten, the 
Tritons were swept on back-to-back 
nights 30-24, 30-22, 30-21 and 30-28, 
30-18, 30-17. 

“This weekend at BYU we did 
not play up to our potential, and 
unfortunately for us, BYU played 
extremely well,” senior libero Eric 
Leserman said. “There were some 
positives, however, including [junior 
opposite hitter] Frank Fritsch having 
a great weekend for us.”

After suffering a sweep the previous 
night, UCSD had a chance to take the 
first set on Saturday, leading by five 
points before the Cougars rallied back 

late and took the match. 
The Tritons broke a 10-10 tie in 

the opening set, scoring three straight 
points to go ahead 13-10 after a dual 
block by Bannan and senior middle 
back Gerald Houseman. UCSD would 
go on to take a 17-12 lead after taking 
advantage of consecutive BYU errors. 
When the Cougars cut the lead to 17-
15, the Tritons surged again to 20-15 
and continued to control the set. With 
the score 28-25 in UCSD’s favor, BYU 
came back on a block and a Triton 
error to bring the score to 28-27. After 
a UCSD timeout, BYU scored three 
straight to take the set by a score of 
30-27. 

UCSD was led by Fritsch, who 
had 10 kills on .381 hitting. Redshirt 
sophomore outside hitter Will Ehrman 
did his part with nine kills while 
Leserman had seven digs. Sophomore 
setter Phil Bannan had 36 assists and 
five digs.

WATER POLO — It was a bitter, 
unforgiving weekend in Irvine for 
the No. 18 Tritons. Coming into the 
UC Irvine Invitational last Saturday 
as the No. 15 seed and ranked 
16th nationally in the standings, 
the women’s water polo team suf-
fered four consecutive losses against 
teams ranked among the top 15.

“It was disappointing,” head 
coach Larry Sanders said of the 
tournament results. “I really felt 
there were some games that we lost 
that we should have won.”

After suffering one-sided defeats 
in the first day of competition, the 
Tritons showed improvement on 
Sunday in losing efforts against No. 
11 Michigan University and No. 13 
Cal State Long Beach. 

The Tritons and the Wolverines 
battled it out defensively in the 
early going, pulling to a 1-1 tie 
at halftime. Neither team was able 
to hold an advantage in the third 
quarter and the period ended in a 
3-3 tie. 

Things fell apart for the Tritons 
in the final period as the Wolverines’ 
endurance proved too much for 
UCSD to handle. Michigan scored 
four goals in the fourth quarter, 
handing the Tritons a tough 7-3 
loss.

In their final match of the week-

end, the Tritons played a bare-
knuckle, wire-to-wire match against 
Cal State Long Beach, which ended 
in a 9-8 sudden-death victory for 
the 49ers. The Tritons came out 
exceptionally strong, holding on to a 
one-point lead after the first, second 
and third quarters before letting Cal 
State Long Beach tie it up to force 
overtime. In the first time out, the 
Tritons came out with an early lead, 
7-6, before the 49ers fought to tie 
it up, yet again, and force sudden 
death.

“We just made some silly mis-
takes that the other team capitalized 
on,” Sanders said. “We need to fix 
those for our season.”

The Tritons were thrust into the 
second-best team in the nation’s 
line of fire right off the bat, facing 
off against Stanford University in 
the opening game of the tourna-
ment. UCSD played tough, but the 
Cardinal was too much to handle 
as the Tritons fell by a score of 
16-6, with junior utility Stephanie 
Heinrich scoring a team-high five 
goals.

The Tritons led by a margin of 
4-3 after the first quarter in their 
effort against Western Water Polo 
Association rival No. 9 Loyola 
Marymount University, but could

SOFTBALL — Playing host to non-
conference opponents last weekend, 
the Tritons split two-game sets against 
Grand Canyon University on Feb. 21 
and University of Hawaii at Hilo on 
Feb. 22. Senior starter Lauren Chastain 
earned her third and fourth wins of the 
season in the Tritons’ two victories.

“When [Chastain’s] on the mound 
she hits her spots,” senior first baseman 
Jenni Habib said. “She’s going to lead to 
a lot of our success this year.”

Locked in a pitching duel, the 
Tritons and the Vulcans entered the 
seventh inning of the opening game 
of Sunday’s doubleheader tied at 
one. Junior catcher Nicole Saari then 
launched a walk-off double to center 
field that plated Habib, giving UCSD 
a 2-1 win.

The two teams found themselves 
in another 1-1 tie midway through the 
second doubleheader before Hawaii-
Hilo scored three runs off extra-base 
hits, taking the victory.

Anchored by Chastain’s complete 
game, UCSD squeezed out a 5-4 win 
over Grand Canyon to begin Saturday’s 
doubleheader. Senior outfielder Allison 
May’s two-run single in the fifth scored 
the tying and go-ahead runs.

A disastrous top of the fourth 
inning sealed a 10-2 UCSD loss in the 
second game of the day against Grand 
Canyon — the only game of the week-
end that was decided by more than two 
runs. With the game scoreless through 
the first three innings, the Antelopes 
scored seven runs in the fourth, bury-
ing the Tritons in the dust.

The Tritons have a tough weekend 
ahead as they open up a four-game set 
with the defending national champi-
ons Humboldt State on Feb. 27 and 
Feb. 28 at home. 

“In practice we’re approaching [this 
series] as we would any other one,” 
Habib said. “We’re working on funda-
mentals and are going to go out and 
stick with our game.”
