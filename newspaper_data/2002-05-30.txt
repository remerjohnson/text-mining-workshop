Divine Dooby Admission standards for UC 
graduate schools scrutinized 
California Assembly passes review bill 

Tyler Huff/Guardion 

Seeing things: Non you are not seeing things. That's the Sun God statue 
with a bong. The addition was placed there for an unknown reason. 

By KIRSTEN HUBBARD 
Staff Writer 

The California State Assembly 
passed a measure May 20 that 
addresses the decrease in the 
recruitment of minority students at 
University of California graduate 
and professional schools. 

The measure, called ACR 178, 
requests that the University of 
California prevent standardized 
test scores from being the primary, 
criterion for graduate chool stu-
dent admissions. 

ACR 178 also requires the UC 
Regents to adopt a comprehensive 
review in their admiSSIOns 
process, much like the compre-
hensive review policy for the 
admission of fall 2002 undergrad -
uates. 

"We aim to promote systemwide 
changes to create more equitable 
UC graduate admissions policies," 
said Assembly member Manolo 
Diaz, one of the founders of the 
measure. "[We are doing this] to 
ensure that students of color have 
grea ter access to the system." 

New contract hailed by both sides 
Nurses ready 
to happily stay 
on the job 
By BRENT HECHT 
Staff Writer 

Several days after the University 
of California and the California 
Nurses Association reached an 
agreement that averted a strike and 
allowed nurses to receive a raise, 
both sides are enthusiastic at the 
prospects of the new UC nursing 
contract, especially when it comes 
to patient care. 

The two sides reached an 
agreement five days before the 
scheduled strike, which threatened 
to restrict the normal operation of 
UC's extensive medical network. 

"Now we can get back to doing 
what we all want, which is take 
care of patients," said UCSD 
nurse and negotiator GeriJenlcins. 

The university is pleased with 
the outcome as well. 

"We came to a mutual under-
standing that both sides felt bene-
fited nurses, patients and UC hos-
pitals," said UC spokesman Paul 
Schwartz. 

Although UC nurses have yet 
to vote on the tentative agree-
ment, the CNA is confident that 
its members wiU throw their sup-
port behind the new contract. The 
CNA is a statewide nursing orga-
nization that represents registered 
nurses working in UC's hospitals 
and student heath service centers,

Centers were at work on Wednesday because of a new labor agreement

pension over three years, depend-
ing on which medical center they 
work at. 

UCSD medical center nurses 
will receive a 19-percent raise 
spread over the next three years. 

See CONTRACT, Page 7 

Under the potential new con-
tract, UC nurses will no longer 
work under merit-based compen-
sation, a long-contested system 
that the CNA says subjects its 
members to biased pay raises. 
Instead, the settlement package 
stipulates that after an initial 
across-the-board increase, the 
University will compensate RNs 
using an experience-based pay-
ment system. The university 
retained the right to financially 
reward performance through 
lump-sum, salary-independent 
awards.

Kevin Mikolaitis, a Warren 
sophomore, feels that the measure 
has positive indications. 

"There are many students who 
haven't had the same chances as 
me," Mikolaitis said. "I feel that 
this is a fair way of helping under-
privileged students have a better 
chance of getting into the schools 
that they want." 

Despite the increasing level of 
diversity present in California 's 
overall population, the number of 
minority students applying and 
enrolling in UC graduate programs 
and professional schools has 
decreased dramatically. 

From the fall of 1994 to the fall 
of 2001, the number of Latinos 
admitted to UC Davis, UC 
Berkel t and UCLA law schools 
declined by 33 percent. [n fall 
200 I, only 57 Latino students were 
enrolled in the three law school . 

Within the same time period, 
the number of black students 
admitted to those schools declined 
by 55 percent. Only 28 black stu-
dents enrolled last fa ll. 

Some people, including 

Mikolaitis, feel th at standa rdized 
tests are significa nt obstacles fo r 
minority students. 

"If a kid doe n't do well quite so 
well on standardi zed tes ts, but 
shows promise in other areas, I 
believe that that kid should at least 
be given an extra look at from 
chools," Mikolaitis said. 

Comprehensive review, often 
considered a "holistic" approach to 
admissions, takes a broad spectrum 
of criterion into con iderati on, 
such as academic background and 
personal qualifica tions, instead of 
mainly standardized tes t scores. 

Critics of comprehensive review 
worry that any de-empha i ~ on 
grades and test scores threatens a 
decline in academic quality. T hey 
feel that the process i; a rowldabollt 
method of initia ting affirma tive

Senior gift heads 
into a new era 
Scholarship and programming 
fund to be institutionalized 
By LAUREN RAU 
Contributing Writer 

This year's senior gift will mark 
the official inception of the Senior 
Class Triton Fund, which will pro-
vide scholarships and extracurricu-
lar programming for years to come. 

The gift itself is simple. Half of 
the donations will go toward schol-
arships for two students: one trans-
fer suJdent and one sophomore 
continuing student, according to 
the Senior Gift Campaign Web 
site, http://www.ucsdseniorgift.kill-
tera.org. 

The other half of the donations 
will contribute to future freshman 
programming in an attempt to 
improve residential life on campus. 

What is unique about this gift is 
the underlying endowment fund.

coaster design competition May 31. 

The outreach program was the work of JSOE stu-
dent organizations, including the Tau Beta Pi 
Engineenng Honor Society, the Society of Women 
Engineers and the Biomedical Engineering Society. 

Participating undergraduates will use hands~n 
instruction to teach tne pupils basic principles of 
physics and engineering. culminating in the roller 
coaster competition. 

The "coasters" are made of rubber tubing fas-
tened to a wooden base and the "cars" are ball bear-
ings that speed through the tubing. The roller coast-
ers will be judged on bearing speed, design creativi-
ty and wise use of materials. 

Students will also tour UCSD. 
The event, which takes place from 9:30 a.m. to 

3 p.m. at Geisel Library, coincides with the ground-
breaking for new facilities to house the Califomia

New UC report condemns 
tobacco company practices 

Two studies conducted by UC researchers reveal 
that the tobacco industry used covert, subversive 
and illegal tactics to protect their business practices. 

The first analysis was authored by Ruth E. 
Malone, an assistant professor of nursing and health 
pol icy at the UC San Francisco School of Nursing. It 
shows that at least two tobacco companies secretly 
monitored anti-smoking groups with the aim of sub-
verting their activities. 

RJ Reynolds and Philip Morris used public rela-
tions agencies and private consultants to illegally 
tape record meetings of a group called Stop Teenage 
Addiction to Tobacco, tried to discredit anti-smoking 
activists and obtained information about anti-smok-
ing $.roups under false pretenses. 

I\Ithough it is not uncommon for companies to 
gather intelligence about competitors, it is surprising 
to see such aggressive activities aimed at obstructing 
the efforts of public health groups: Malone said. 

The second study was authored by Stanton 
Glantz, professor of medicine at the UCSF; Dr. 
Pamela M. Ling. a postdoctoral fellow at UCSF's 
Center for AIDS Prevention; and Anna Landman, 
tobacco document researcher at the American Lung 
Association of Colorado. 

It shows that tobacco industry-initiated anti-
smoking programs for students are ineffective and 
may in fact increase the likelihood of smoking. 

Such programs apparently never mentioned the 
addictive properties of nicotine or harmful effects of 
smoking. and instead emphasize the "adult" nature 
of of choosing to smoke. 

The curricula's structuring was designed to 
stave off further anti-tobacco legislation, the study 
found. The results of the study are published in 
the June issue of the American Journal of Public 
Health. 

Study shows potassium-rich 
foods can prevent osteoporosis 

According to medical researchers at the 
University of California, San Francisco, foods rich with 
potassium such as bananas, orange juice and toma-
toes decrease a woman's chance of contracting 
osteoporosis. 

Potassium, the researchers say, aids in maintaining 
healthy calci um levels. Calcium is often lost through 
urine after excessive sak consumption. While dietary 
calcium and vitamin D have already proven beneficial 
to the maintenance of bone denSity, UCSF's study is 
the first to link potassium to the prevention of bone 
density loss in high-sodium diets. 

In the study, researchers compared the excretion 
levels of calcium and the bone protein MTX between 
women taking a potassium supplement and a con-
trol group given a placebo. Female subjects that 
were given the placebo had' higher levels of urinary 
calcium excretion. 

The National Osteoporosis Foundation estimates 
that 55 percent of Americans ages 50 and older are 
at risk for the bone deterioration disease, which 
affects nearly 44 million Americans, most of whom 
are women. 

The study appears in the May issue of the 
Journal of Clinical Endicrinology and Metabolism 
and was funded by the National Institute of 
Health.

UC Davis policy leads 
to lecturer strike 
UCSD counterparts to rally 
By CLAIRE J. VANNETTE 
Senior Staff Writer 

Lecturers at the University of 
California, Davis began a two-day 
strike yesterday in response to 
impending terminations of several 
lecturers by the university. The 
university, however, argues that its 
policies regarding lecturers are in 
students' best interest. 

According to Steve Hopcraft, 
media representative for the pro-
testers, the central issue being con-
tested is the adminisrration's plan 
to terminate lecturers after six-year 
teaching terms. 

Five lecturers will lose their 
jobs in June because they have 
taught for six years. One of these 
lecturers received the University of 
California's 2001 Excellence in 
Teaching Award. 

Hopcraft called the termina-
tions "arbitrary and iII-con-
ceived." 

Additionally, the lecturers are 
protesting policies prohibiting lec-
turers from teaching most upper 
division courses. 

Dean Elizabeth Langland told 
the The Davis Enurprirt that the 
university has a need for ladder-
rank faculty. 

"We've been told by the legisla-
ture, by the citizens, by the parents 
to put tenure-track faculty in front 
of the students," Langland said last 
week. 

Research faculty and post-doc-
lorate and graduate students would 
replace the dismissed lecturers. 

Peter Rock, dean of mathemat-

ical and physical sciences, along 
with Steven Shefferin, dean of 
social sciences, stand with 
Langland on the issue of lecturers. 

The three deans were unavail-
able (or comment to the Guardian 
by press ti me. 

On May 29, protesters picketed 
and staged a rally outside Davis' 
Wellman Hall. 

Merlene Williams, associate 
director of undergraduate educa-
tion at Davis' College of Letters 
and Sciences, said at least 200 stu-
dents, faculty and staff members 
picketed on Wednesday at several 
locations aroWld campus, hoping 
to disrupt deliveries and other uni-
versity business. 

The Sturammto Bte estimates 
the number of protesters at 80. 

Participating students and fac-
ulty carried tombstones and a cof-
fin, symbolizing the proposed ter-
mination of the lecturers. 

Police presence at the pickets 
and rally was overwhelming, 
Williams said. The picketing and 
strike caused about 100 classes to 
be canceled, the Btt reported. 

In response to similar con-
cerns, UCSD lecturers will rally 
May 30 at noon in Price Center. 
After an initial speech, they will 
march to the chancellor 's office 
complex. 

The Lecturers' Job Action Task 
Force cites two years of "bad faith 
bargaining" between lecturers and 
th e University of California, as 
well as an unsatisfactory pending 
proposal , as reasons behind the 
growing protest.

"Usually, the gift was not decided 
until the beginning of spring 
quaner, which is pretty late." 

In years past, there were few 
occasions when no one came for-
ward to shoulder the responsibil-
ity, Tsang said. The most recent 
example of this is the absence of 
a senior gift from the class of 
1997. 

Past gifts were often tangible 
objects that were useful, but most-
ly went unnoticed. For example , 
in 1992 and 1993, the gifts were 
recycling receptacles. 

"That doesn 't give any sense of 
continuity, which is something we 
really need, given the general lack 
of philanthropic spirit on th is 
campus," Goodwin said. 

As a response to these prob-
lems, last year the Annual Giving 

ing on the University's ban on 
affinnative action. 

"This plan completely com-
plies with the guidelines of 
Proposition 209, and no one gets 
an unfair preference," Bustamante 
said. "What we're attempting to 
do is look at the complete student, 
including life experiences, com-
mitment to public service and aca-
demic performance." 

The measure is expected to be 
implemented in the UC admis-
sions process by the end of the 
2002-2003 academic year. 
According to Jantz, the measure is 
just a resolution, however, and 
will only request the changes to be 
made, not require them. 

Diaz feels that the measure is 

Office of UCSD approached the 
Student Foundation to form a 
committee that would direct the 
planning of the senior gift. The 
group includes members of the 
Student Foundation, A.S. Council 
officers and the senior senators of 
the five colleges. Two memhers of 
Annual Giving also assist the stu-
dent group. This is the second 
year that the Senior Gift 
Campaign Committee has con-
vened. 

Last year's gift was a pair of 
scholarships given to a transfer 
student and a continuing student. 

"[Last year] was a really suc-
cessful year," l sang said. "I think 
it was a gift people were actually 
interested in being a part of, for 
once. We raised a record high of 
over 59,000, which nearly doubles 
the average of past years. " 

Many of the same people 
from last year's committee served 
this year as well. According to 
Tsang, the Annual Giving Office 
and the Student Foundation 
agreed that the first few commil-
tees should include undercl ass-
men who cou ld maintain the

extremely necessary in the face 
of California's increasing diversi-
ty. 

"With the increasing diversity 
of the general population in 
California, the low rates of stu -
dents of color in the UC graduate 
and professional schools are 
completely unacceptable," Diaz 
said. 

Bustamante claims that the 
measure will have extensive bear-
ing on California as a'whole. 

"UC graduate and professional 
schools belong to all California 
taxpayers," Bustamante said. "It is 
vital to the future economic 
growth of the state of California 
that equal opportuniti es are avai l-
able to aiL" 

position and provide continuing 
leadership. 

It was this past experience that 
led to the formation of the endow-
ment fund . 

"We wanted to create a set, 
instituted gift for future commit-
tees to implement," Tsang said. 
"It's been a problem in the past 
where the committee spent most 
of it's time just deciding on the gift 
[and not pl anning itl ." 

This year's senior gift is still 
growing. Tsang said that graduat-
ing seniors and their families have 
already pledged about $4,000. 
Booths will be set up al the com-
mencement ceremonies and flyers 
will be distributed. However, 
donating via the campaign Web 
si te is the most direct way. 

"This is the one chance the 
se niors have to come together as a 
group - not just in their individ-
ual colleges - to give back to the 
UCSD community." llang said. 

"I am certain that everyone 
has been touched by their experi -
ence here in one way or anorher 
and thi s a way 10 give back, to 
leave a legacy of philanthropy."

Shame on you, 
two-faced 
Govemor Davis 

California Gov. Gray Davis is coming to 
UCSD for the groundbreaking of two bmld-
ings on the Earl Warren College campus. 
The Guardian feels that Davis should be 
ashamed to come to the university after he 
reneged on his campaign promise to not cut 
education and slashed UC funding by $162 
million. 

The California Institute for 
Telecommunications and Information 
Technology building, as well as the Jacob 
School of Engineering's Computer Science 
and Engineenng department building, will 
be the subjects of the dedication ceremony. 
Davis will try to use the trip to gather sup-
port from younger voters in an election year, 
but the students of UCSD should take it 
with a STain of salt. 

DaVlS will be putting on a show at the cer-
emony, trying to look like he is still champi-
oning education as he promised in his cam-
paign, The truth is that Davis just made sig-
nificant cuts to the UC budget after lie 
promised not to. While the cuts protect 
'core functions" of the University of 
California, they make large cuts to research, 
something that is vital to UCSD in particu-
lar. 

The Guardian is not trying to vilify 
California's governor. We are simply point-
ing out to the students that DaVls made a 
promise not to touch education four years 
ago and is now making cuts. We understand 
that these are hard economic times and that 
cuts needed to be made, but if Davis valued 
education so much, couldn't he have found 
other places to trim fat? 

The Guardian has previously expressed its 
opinion that all other avenues should have 
been explored before such cuts were made 
to education - apparently, Davis wasn't 
reading.

I THINK irS TIME WE DID S()MUHING ABOUT OUR INTElliGENCE. 

Wake up America: Our nation's 
citizens take much for granted 
Volunteer experience in impoverished area 

highlights disadvantages others face 
By RUBY CHEN 
Staff Writer 

Now that Sun God is over and finals 
are nearing, the end of another school 
year is slowly creeping up on us. Seniors 
are preparing for graduation and the 
underclassmen are just happy that they 
survived another year of college. Before 
we embrace summer vaca tion, I just have 
one question for all the students at 
UCSD: What did you do this school 
year? 

Yes, reflect over all you did this entire 
school year. Is there anything in particu-
lar that you are most proud of and stands 
out the most in your mind? If so, why 
and how? 

I imagine that many answers lie at 
ei ther of the two ends of the college 
spectrum - one, ~I studied so hard that 
1 received provost's honors each quar-
ter," or two, "I pllTtitd so hard and got 
drunk very often, but still managed not 
to get kicked out of schooL" 

Although both are very impressive 
accomplishments, is there anyone at 
UCSD who can remember sacrificing 
precious studying (or partying) time to 
do something genuinely nice for his or 
her community or for others in need? 

This brings me to the weekend of 
May 17, otherwise notoriously known as 
Sun God weekend. Instead of partying, 
drinking and participating in the festive 
Sun God celebrations, I chose to be part 
of a group who went down to Tijuana for 
the weekend to build a house for the 
homeless , 

Around 30 men and women, consist-
ing mostly of your fellow UCSD stu-
dents and a few members of the La Jolla 
community, happily volunteered to 
spend the weekend in Tijuana. We 
worked in trenches alongside pinch bugs 
to build the foundation and walls for two 
homes, a clinic and a school. 

The volunteer program 1 participated 
in is coordinated by the Catholic 
Community at UCSD, in collaboration 
with Esperanza International, a nonprof-
it, nonsectarian charitable organization 
similar to Habitat for Humanity. It 
works with service clubs and churches 
dedicated to empowering the poor so 
they can help themselves. 

This was not at all a paternalistic, 

I'm-better-than-you-so-Iet-me-help-you 
type of trip. The goal of all the volun-
teers was not to raise the living condi-
tions in Mexico to our American stan-
dards; it was purely to help people build 
whatever was needed. We worked side by 
side with locals. The volunteers were just 
there to lend a helping hand, not to build 
wonders because we come from America, 
the land of golden opportunities. 

The whole trip was a privilege for me. 
How many people get to go to a Third 
World country and experience what it is 
like living there? Although all the volun-
teers stayed at the Posada Esperanza, 
which had running water and electricity 

The goal of the volunteers 
was not to raise the living 
conditions in mexico up to 
our American standards; it 
was purely to help people 

build whatever was needed. 
We worked side by side 

with locals. The volunteers 
were just lending a helping 
hand, not to build wonders 

because we come from 
America, the land of golden 

opportunities. 

(unlike the local houses), we still had to 
make major adjustments to our daily 
habits to accommodate the scarcity of 
resources in Mexico. 

For example, I learned to take a full 
shower in one minute. Try doing that 
here in the United States with our 
fancy bathtubs and shower accessories. 
In Tijuana, it was literally wet down, 
turn off the water, lather, rinse off and 
you're out. Although that seems quite 
impossible - especially for women, 
who have more hair to wash - all of 
the volunteers managed, without much 
difficulty, to abide by the one-minute 
shower rule. 

That epitomizes the main lesson 1 
learned from my trip to Tijuana: how 

much we Americans take for granted the 
vast amount of resources we have avail-
able to us. Even as I'm writing this arti-
cle, I'm thinking about the amount of 
money I put into upgrading my hard 
drive space in my computer just so 1 can 
download more MP3s. The people in 
Tijuana would be plenty satisfied with 
just a computer that works, let alone a 
computer with a huge hard disk. 

Esperanza's volunteer coordinator. 
Robert Rivers, told us, "If everyone in 
the world were to live like a middle-class 
American, it would take the resources of 
two-and-a-half more worlds to support 
us." 

Given that startling revelation, I 
thinle it is about time that we begin mak-
ing some changes to how we live our life 
and spend our money. 

On the subject of the United States-
Mexican border, Rivers also informed us 
that the majority of Mexicans do not 
even want to immigrate illegally to the 
United States. Given the opportunities 
and resources in Mexico as we are given 
in America, no Mexican would even 
think of leaving his or her family and 
friends behind to travel through treach-
erous terrain in search of a job that pays 
well to help support the family. He told 
us this when we visited the United States 
- Mexican border. 

Other than listening to Rivers, my 
attention was fixated on the Mexican 
man crouched behind the border wall , 
clutching a picture of his family while 
waiting for the U.S. border patrol to 
switch guards , He was one of the many 
Mexicans planning to jump the fence 
that night, 

Why is it that when we cross the bor-
der into Canada, there is a huge sign 
stating something along the lines of 
"brotherhood forever"? Yet, the 
Mexican-American border consists of 
two fences - one brick and one metal 
prison fence that caves inward. There is 
a park at the border between San Ysidro 
and Tijuana ironically named 

~Friendship Park." 
Why is the grass on the United 

States side mowed and green, and dec-
orated with pretty blocks of cement, 
picnic benches and barbeque grills,

THURSDAY. MAY 30, 2002 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5 

Reflections on UCSD years teach lessons basically 
Though the future is uncertain, college memories are treasured 
By ALEX I. LEE 
Senior Staff Writer 

Now I know I'm getting older. 
People ask me the same question I 
used to ask upperclassmen when I 
was a freshman: "What are you 
going to do after you gTaduate?" I 
can only thinle of the usual reply: 
"Take a year off, work, grad school 
... damned if I know!" 

My sentiment is pure cliche, of 
course. Almost everyone else in 
my shoes (a 21-year-old nervously 
eyeing the arrival of his final year 
as an undergrad) probably admits 
to such uncertainty. 

Doubts about my future aside, 
I'd rather take time to reflect upon 
my past three years at UCSD. Call 
me sentimental - or perhaps 
another stressed-out student hop-
ing to find catharsis through this 
silly article before finals week hell 
- but I think a little perspective is 
just what the doctor ordered. 

I was apple juice and now I am 
cider. Hackneyed sentiments 
about growing pains and coming-
of-age never seem to disappear, 
even in the Gwtrdilm. Still, I'll 
admit that I find comfort in hear-
ing about other people 's struggles, 
however "trite" they may sound. 
In the end, realizing that I'm not 
alone reminds me about the uni-
versality of our experiences. It also 
reminds me to never underesti-
mate the power of human compas-
sion and understanding. 

I've met a lot of people in San 
Diego over the years. Then again, 
I haven 't met nearly enough.

talk, something I always admired. 
Such people are hard to come by, 
especially in a world where hype is 
often valued more than the real 
thing. Some people can look no 
further than beyond themselves in 
conversation and compassion. 
Others, such as Joe, become a 
friendly ear. 

Where have all the years gone, 
I wonder? There are so many 
other faces I have known, but only 
a few do I keep in touch with. 
Perhaps fall -outs with acquain-
tances and close friends alike are to 
be expected during college - just 
another echo of that life-lessons 
speech you heard during high 
school graduation. In the end, 
despite many people being absent 
in my present life, I will take the 
lessons I have learned from every-
one I've met with me into the 
unlmown future. I can only hope 
that they thinle of me in the same 
regard. 

The words of Chris Stevens, 
philosopher extraordinaire, seem 
only appropriate. This being my 
final article of the year, I propose a 
question instead of an answer to 
everyone who may have com-
plained about UCSD for one rea-
son or another. His wise words are 
as follows : "I thinle when you are 
somewhere, you oughta be there, 
'cause it's not about how long you 
stay in a place. It's about what you 
do while you're there. And when 
you go, will the place where you've 
been be any better off for your 
having been there?" 

For III of us li-itons, I certainly 
hope so. 

T he greatest mis-take mankind ever 
made was thinking that 
summer was a goOd thing. 

Oh sure, it seems like a grtat 
idea on the surface. No school, 
everyone wears brighter colors, 
good movies come out ... 

These things are just illusions. 
Summtr STICKS. And here is why: 
Sandal Season 

I take issue with sandals on 
several levels. (That's right, I'm 
deep. Deal with it.) 

First of all , I have ugly feet. 
I'm talking Striously gross here; 
my mother actually takes the time 
to warn men about these puppies. 

To start with, my feet are 
ridiculously small . I am 5-foot-7 
and 1 wear a size six. 
Proportionally speaking, this 
means that my feet are to me what 
Rhode Island is to the Western 
Hemisphere. 

So once you actually pull out 
your telescope and take a close 
look at my small-ass feet, you will 
then notice that my toenails are 
rather hard to locate, even with 
the help of magnifying equip-
ment. Yes, I have tiny toenails. I 
was four years old before I had 
any nails whatsoever on my pinkie 
toes. I could rptll "toenail" before 
I had any. "Pathetic" is too nice a 
word. 

But let's say 1 decide that I hate 
the world and decide to ruthlessly 
punish it by wearing sandals. My 
feet are onl y made that much 
uglier by the fact that those damn 
sandals cut into my feet so badly 
that I have to limp around like 
some sort of Quasimodo 
wannabe. 

Graduating gadfly offers ideas for making a mark 
People, my feet have a small 

enough surface area as it is. I do 
not want to waste any of it with 
damn wtlu from sandals I had to 
actually shop for in the children's 
department. Talk about adding 
injury to insult.

Fine. So I should lay in the sun 
for a couple of hours, right? Get a 
nice, sexy tan and be done with it. 

I don't think so. 
For me, lying in the sun just 

means getting burned. And that 
won't turn into a tan afterwards, 
either. It will slowly fade back into 
the white abyss from which it came. 

Why can't disgustingly pale 
skin be attractive all year? Who 

long time to get on stage. 
As I came back to the United 

States that Sunday, I regret ro 
admit that I felt a rush of relief 
knowing that I have a nice, fur-
nished apartment to come home to. 
I also felt motivation to do some-
thing - anything. 

The border issues with Mexico 
need a resolution and it has to 
come from the governments of the 
United States and Mexico. 

I am damn proud to be an 
American because I am lucky 
enough to be given the opportuni-
ties and resources to make a differ-
ence. Just as Rivers said, "Bloom 

says the subtle shimmer of blue 
veins under a challey arm isn't 
sexy? Not me, baby! 
Whaling season 

Of course, even if I do decide 
to take that final step into sun-
burn land, I have to be properly 
dressed for it. 

And that, my friends, means 
buying a bathing suit. 

What is it about dressing 
rooms that make all women look 
horrible in bathing suits? I honest-
ly don't look that bad naked. 
(Well, OK, let's just say I've been 
naked in front of other people and 
they didn't go blind. I call that 
"not bad.") 

But the biggest pisser is that

I am definitely going to Tijuana 

again . next year - not just to go 
clubbing, but to build a house. In 
fact, 1 am going to be on the com-
minee that organizes the trip. 

So if anyone asks me again next 
year, "What did you do this school 
year?" my answer will be the same 
as this year: I spent the weekend in 
lJ, building a house and eating 
some awesome, authentic Mexican 
food. 

For more information about 
Esperanza International Inc., visit 
its official Web site at 
http://wufw.trptrll1lZllinU17llltitmiJl.org 

even if I do end up settling for a 
bathing suit that makes me look 
like only 10 Ibs of shit stuffed into a 
5-lb bag (as opposed to 20 Ibs of 
shit), I am then elj>ected to wear it 
in public! People have to Stt mt in 
it! 

To me, summer means watch-
ing young children flee in fear 
when 1 expose myself in 
swimwear. And 1 am supposed to 
loolt forwllrd to that? 

So basically, there is nothing 
redeeming about summer. It 
causes nothing but despair and 
low self-esteem. Not to mention 
skin cancer (which I only care 
about because my mother makes 
me).

You could secretly remove all 
the moveable rocks from the rock

with rocks that spell out Greek

If you don't like walking, build 
better bike paths through cam-
pus. You could secretly chop 
down eucalyptus trees in the 
name of ecological purity. If you 
don't like driving to school, help 
convince the San Diego Transit

Someone needs to teach Vice

THURSDAY, MAY 30, 2002 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Student newspaper apologizes for 
controversial cartoon in joke issue 
Some students want fees returned from paper 

(U -WIRE) MINNEAPOLIS 
- Amid protests from U niversity 
of Minnesota students outraged by 
a ca rtoon in the spring humor 
issue, Tbr MinntsOtll Daily issued a 
rare apology this month and is con-
sidering eliminati ng the semester-
end lampoon issue altogether. 

More than 30 students crowded 
the entryway to the Daily on May 
17, voicing anger and disappoint-
ment over the cartoon ti tied 
"Thuggish Ruggish," which 
appeared on the last page of the 
sports section in the spring finals 
issue. 

The cartoon showed a black 
man, Laron, talking to his friend in 
urban slang about having sex with a 
blacle woman named Trina. When 
Trina discovers she's pregnant, she 
calls Laron, who accuses her of 
being promiscuous, calls her a 
bitch and slams down the phone. 

Critics said the cartoon perpetu-
ated stereotypes that blacks are igno-
rant, irresponsible and promiscuous. 

"People at the Dllily and the 
powers that be were so insensitive," 
said Hollies J. Wmston, a second-
year law student. 

The Daily 's then-Editor in 
Chief Mike Wereschagin, who has 
since completed his one-year term, 
issued an apology on the Dllily's 
Web site. He said the cartoon was 
not meant to be malicious or racist. 

"I didn't think enough when I 
saw it," he said. "Basically, I didn't 
do my job." 

The group of students - which 
included members of the New 
Black Panther Party and Africana 
- requested the formal apology 
and asked that the Daily terminate 
the illustrator and implement pro-
cedures to make the Daily staff 
more culturally aware. 

Winston said a larger multicul-
tural presence in tlle Daily 's news 
room could hel p increase racial 
sensi tivi ty. 

"The paper should reflect the 
diversity at the university," he said. 
"It certainly isn 't being reflected." 

Pre -medical junior Ezckiel 
Ashamu said he is frustrated with 

Contract: 
UCSD nurses to receive 
a 19 percent raise 
Continued from page 1 

The settlement paclcage also 
requires that each UC medical 
center establish a CNA-UC advi-
sory board to examine implemen-
tation o ptions for next year's new 
mandatory statewide nurse 
staffing ratios. 

The CNA had hoped to add 
specific ratios to the new contract. 
The advisory board was a com-
promise made at the bargaining 
table. 

The university must consider in 

negative portrayals of blacks in the 
media . 

Ashamu said the Doily has been 
racially insensitive in the past, cit-
ing a political cartoon by a differ-
ent artist that appeared on the 
Daily 's editorial page in 2000. 

The cartoon ran after the 
University of Wisconsin-Madison 
digitally added a black student to a 
promotional photo to make the 
school appear more diverse. The 
Doily editorial cartoon depicted 
University President Mark Yudof 
applying black face paint. Pete 
Wagner, the cartoonist, said at the 
time that the satire was aimed at 
critiquing the facade of diversity on 
college campuses. 

George Barganier, a department 
of education graduate student, said 
the illustration reflects a deeper 
problem of racism on campus. 

"That's what they treat us like 
on campus, from professors to jan-
itors," Barganie said. "That's why 
[the university) can't attract any 
faculty of color." 

Mike DeArmond, the former 
art director who created the illus-
tration under the name "butter D," 
said he was only trying to be funny 
and said he thinks people are taking 
the cartoon too seriously. 

"I was trying to polee fun at the 
ignorant stereotypes. People took 
it as the opposite," he said. "It was 
obviously unintended ... Some of 
the words are direct quotes from 
rap songs." 

"In retrospect, it was poor judg-
ment," DeArmond said. "If I 
thought anyone would have taken 
o ffe nse to it, I wouldn't have 
dreamed of doing it." 

DeArmond left the Daily at the 
end of the semester. 

The humor issue controversy 
isn't the first at the Daily. In 1979, 
the Daily's finals issue featmed a 
mock interview with Jesus Christ. 

The issue was meant to parody 
grocery store tabloids and was 
intended to be funny, editors said at 
the time. Outraged by the issue, 
then-University President Peter 
MacGrath pushed a policy allow-

sta ffing ratios other types of nurses 
not represented by the CNA, such 
as licensed vocational nurses, and 
thus was not able to meet the 
union 's demands regarding the 
issue, Schwartz said. 

"We did not feel it was appro-
priate to malee an agreement on 
staff ratios independent of 
[upcoming) state regulations," he 
said. 

For the nurses, the decision to 
strike was not an easy one, but they 
feel it may have helped in the end, 
according to Jenkins. 

"It's not a move you talee lightly, 
but it made them understand the 
seriousness of the situation," 
Jenkins said. " It was necessary to 
get our point across."

ing stud ents to withhold Student 
Services Fees money from the 
Doily. The newspaper sued, and the 
8th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 
that the action violated the paper's 
First Amendment righ ts. 

Reacting to this spring's issue, 
some students and community 
leaders said thcy want to be reim-
bursed for their Student Services 
Fees that help underwrite the 
Dllily. 

"We should get that back and 
donate it to Africana," Bargainer 
said. 

Shanna Orr, the Dllily's new pres-
ident, said that "cutting off their 
interaction and support for the Daily 
is harmful to both of our causes." 

Winston said the money could 
also be used to form a multicultur-
al advisory committee for the staff. 

Todd Milbourn, the Dllily's new 
editor in chief, who took over after 
the finals issue was published, said 
that although the cartoon was 
insulting and irresponsible, its not 
representative of the Dllily's work 
as a whole. 

"The Dllily should be an open 
environment for anyone on this 
campus," he said. "I would Iilee to 
see the Dllily be a forum." 

Milbourn said he was consider-
ing publishing a "semester in 
review" edition instead of a parody. 

Tyler Richter, a member of last 
year's fees comminee, said the fees 
committee cannot allow students 
to pick and choose which groups 
they want to fund . 

"For someone to take anything 
in that [finals) issue too seriously 
would be a remiss in judgment," he 
said. "1 don 't think the Daily should 
be subject to any consequences, 
given tlle context it was in ." 

If swdcnts were allowed to pick 
which groups they fl.mded it would 
be impossible to fairly allocate 
funding, Richer said. 

But Barb Ilartman, also a fees 
committee member, said this issue 
could haunt the Daily during next 
year's fees process.

Through the decades: a journey through pop culture from the 19505 to the future 
'50s '60s '70s '80s '90s 

A delighted Ben Affleck sums up life as a film hero 
The actor reflects on future projects and work with Morgan Freeman in new film 
ByMAMEVANS 
Staff Writer 

Ben Affleck is just a regular guy. He's been to college, he's loyal to his friends and he 
works hard . Affleck is also a popu-
lar movie star, and while the rest of 
us are doing odd jobs this summer, 
he will be watching [Q see how his 
new movie, "The Sum of All 
Fears," survives in the box office 
against this su mmer 's heavy hit-
ters. 

"The Sum of all Fears" is 
Hollywood's latest adaptation of 
author Tom Clancy's spy novel of 
the same name. In the past, the 
principle character of CIA agent 
Jack Ryan has been played by 
Harrison Ford and Alec Baldwin, 
but the role has since been passed 
on to Affleck. 

"Getting to play Jack Ryan is 
sort oflike getting [Q play Hamlet," 

Affleck said about his decision to 
take on the role. "It was kind of a 
no-brainer for me." 

To accommodate the younger 
Affleck in the role, the filmmakers 
chose to portray the character of 
Ryan at the beginning of his career. 
The change in plot, however, did 
not deter Affleck, who is a self-pro-
fessed "huge fan" of Clancy's nov-
els. 

"I was just kind of a fan going 
in (to the projectl, and then as a 
fan being asked to be part of 
something that you'd always 
admired is a really big dea l," 
Affleck said. "I thought ["The 
Sum of All Fears"1 was kind of a 
thinking man's or woman's movie 
and I thought they took some 
really bold choices." 

"The Sum of All Fears," which 
began filming in early 2001, packs 
some radical plot components that 
arc shockingly similar to current 

national events. Affleck, however, is 
confident that the movie sti ll has an 
audience among American movie-
goers. 

"We started off making a kind of 
scapist political thriller, and the 
movie didn't change, but the audi-
ence changed and now that politi-

Ben 
Affleck 
The Sum of 

All Fears 

cal thriller has become a drama," 
Affleck said. 

Bold plot lines aside, the oppor-
tunity to star alongside Morgan 
Freeman, who plays CIA senior 
agent William Cabot, excited 
Affleck most. Affleck equated the 
experience of working with the 
famous star to that of having a 

chance to play basketball with 
Michael Jordan. 

"I was respectful of Morgan, 
bordering on sort of reverential, 
probably bordering on annoying to 
him," Affleck said . "I just consid-
ered it an honor to be in the same 
movie as him." 

Affleck lives a life that many of 
us can only dream of. His best 
friend and business partner is Man 
Damon, who wrote and stared 
with Affleck in "Good Will 
Hunting." Affl eck also considers 
director Kevin Smith a good 
friend and will be appearing later 
this year in Smith's "Jersey GirL" 
Working with Smith is a com-
pletely different experience for 
Affle cle, and one that rivals an 
appearance in a summer block-
buster. 

"To be honest with you, in 
some ways Kevin 's movie~ are 
more personally satisfying to me," 

Affleck said. "Although there is 
something really fun about being 
in a movie that is a big fl ashy thrill 
ride." 

The idea of working behind the 
ca mera again, as he did with 
Damon in "Good Will Hunting," 
also excites Affleck. In addition to 
helping to create "Project 
Greenlight," which helps aspiring 
filmmaleers, Afflecle is working on a 
reality/drama TV show called 
"Push, Nevada." 

An ambitious work ethic will be 
secondary this summer, however, as 
Affleck will be watching the box 
office, leeeping an eye on the 
progress of his latest project. 

"There is kind of a nebulous , 
unknowable Movie God who 
somehow, in the course between 
you taking the movie and it coming 
out, either smiles or kind of frowns 
on the movie," Affleck said. "And 
you just never know."

Pay Attention: Senior CIA agent William Cabot (Freeman) gives novice agent Jack Ryan (Affleck) key pointers. 

Have nothing to fear, 'Sum' is good 
Affleck and Freeman flex their CIA muscles against nuclear terrorists 
By MARA EVANS 
Staff Writer 

If you've seen the trai ler for "The Sum of Al l FeaTS," you've already seen the movie. 
Enough said . T h e political 
thriller staring Ben Affl eck 
("Dogma") and Morgan Freeman 
("Shawshank Redemption") has 
made Hollywood nervous, so a 
little too much is given away in 
the previews. The film , however, 
has got more to it than meets the 
eye. 

"The Sum of All Fears" hJS 
been adapted to the ilvcr screen 
from Tom Clancy's novel of the 
same name. Yet, the character of 
Jack Ryan (Affleck) is younge r 
than 111 previolls films when Alec 
BaldWin and I larrison Ford 
playcd the character. 

The terronsts of the film have 
al,o changcd. As the movie 
unfold;, It becomes apparent that 
neo- azis are plotting to cause 
Russia and '\merica to destroy 
each other over an unclaimed 
nuclear explosion, and it is up to 
Ryan to stop them. 

Affleck does an admirable job 
pla>~ng Rya n. As a you ng, inexpe-
rienced version of the agent, he is 
essentially acting in territory that 
Baldwin and Ford didn't have to 
deal with. Affleck nevertheless 
maintains the cinematic cliches of

to whet your apetite. It seems as if 
listeners arc already doi ng just t . lt

Billboard 200. 

Recently, blank CDs have been 
outselling pre-recorded CDs. Many

purchased music. Moby reportedly 
has a 14-year-old cousin who has

ers also have to share some of the 
blame for perpetuati ng the trend , 
but then agai n, it's the record labels 
who beat these trends to death. 

This vicious cycle will continue

The movie is also visually

scene in which Ryan escapes the

"special" for its own good? Just 
take a look at the special edition of 
"Memento" and you'll be just as 
confused wi th the DVD as you 
were when you watched the film in 
the theater. 

"Memento" is a memorable and 
gripping fi lm that has captured the 
intellect of many movie watchers. 
Leonard (Guy Pierce) is a man who 
has lost short-term memory after a 
violent encounter with his wife's 
murderer. 

Without the ability to remem-
ber what has just ocuned, Leonard 
writes down everything on post-it 
notes, polaroids and even himself as 
a way to avenge his wife's murder. 

Complicating things for 
Leonard is the supporting cast of 
Natalie (Carrie Anne-Moss) and 
Teddy (Joe

The Real Word You Never Saw: 
Chicago 

Before "Survi vor, " before "Big 
Brother," and yes, before 
"Temptation Island II," there was 
MTV's "The Real World ." Now, II 
seasons later, the only curren tly 
running reality series to pre-date 
the DVD has embraced the new-
age video format and released an 
extra -footage disc: "The Real 
World You Never Saw: Chicago." 
However, at only 45 minutes each , 
are the DVDs really worth the 

~Real World" addict's hard-earned 
(or parent-earned) cash? 

"The Real World You Never 
Saw: Chicago" DVD, which fea-
rures never-before-seen footage of 

the most 

play characters @)..."!I-~ DVD Pantolino), who ~ 
that befriend v- ->--------
Leonard. Or do REVIEW 

recent season's 
cast, is for the 
most part a 
slam dunk. 
Any fan of the 
season will 

they? Without 
short-term 
memory, Leonard 
forgets them in a matter of hours. 

The film feels like a bad weed 
trip, making the viewer go around 
in circles to reach a concI usion that 
leaves him in a big haze. What sets 
the film apart from conventional 
revenge thrillers is its chronologi-
cal plotline. You have to see it to 
truly understand it. 

Although the film is superb, the 
DVD is overbearing. Instead of 
using straightforward menus to see 
th e fil m and watch the suppl emen-
tal features, the menus are a series 
of questions that one must answer 
in ordc r to see the extras. 

Upon first viewing, it's unique. 
But after extended viewings, it 's not 
only tedious, but downright alUloy-
ing. 

The DVD also contains various 
featurettes and an audio commen-
tary by the soft-spoken director, 
Christopher Nolan. Overall, the 
quality is sufficient and helps lO 
explain tile underlying concept of 
the intriguing film. Otller extras 
included are production stil ls and 
sketches, a short story written by the 
directors brother and "Anatomy of a 
Scene," a Sundance Channel series. 

There's probably many more 
extras hidden in the confusing 
menus. However, hours are needed 
to discover all of them. 

\,vith a perfec t combination of an 
intense fi lm and elaborate DVD 
production, "Memento" redefines 
the movie experience: You don 't 

clicks throughout the music, which 
basically leaves the MP3 unlisten-
able. People will inevitably avoid 
these copy-protected CDs because 
they wi ll be unable to create MP3s 
to burn on to CDs or their MP3 
pl ayers. Music fans will be forced to 
look for copies of CDs e.lsewhere 
- copies that ca n be ripped. 

Entertainment technology \vi ll 
always push fo rward . T he fe ar 
record companies exhibi t over dig-
ital technology is similar to the fear 
over radio, television, VCRs, cas-
sette tal>es and CDs. None of those 
products spelled disaster for the 
entertainment industry. 
Technology will move on and the 
music industry, along wi th others, 
are sure to foll ow. Some record 
companies have already tried to 
capitalize on the MP3 era: Media 
conglomerate Vivendi, who owns 
Universal Music, acquired Napster 
and MP3.com. 

With more and more music 
being found as fil es on our comput-
ers rather than CDs purchased 
from a record store, the possiblity 
of how albums are created are end-
less. 

As CD burners become as com-
mon as portable CD players or 
television sets, artists can take full 

surely enjoy a "Real 
World" -gasm watching all the extra 
footage available on the disc, which 
includes featurettes on cast mem-
ber Cara's obsession with one of the 
show's directors, fellow cast mem-
ber Aneesa's penchant for naked-
ness and the forbidden relations 
between cast and crew. 

Although each individual fea-
turette is entertaining, the DVD 's 
most valuable treasure lies in its 
shockingly friendly tone. Without a 
doubt, the fea turettes show that, 
despite all the efforts of the MTV 
broadcast crew to create interper-
sonal world wars, Chicago's "Real 
World" cast actually liked one 
another ... a lot. This nmst-be-seen-
to-be-believed revelation is alone 
wortll the DVD's price to any co n-
science-heari ng "Real World" fan. 

The "Exclusive DVD Features" 
so vividly advertised on the DVD's 
co\'er arc not nearly as inspiring. [n 
fact, cxcepl fo r the C:lst \'ideo pro-
ti les, they are down Tight garbage. 
Ilowever, given the hon \Is-I i ke 
nature of the main content of the 
di sc, quality "exclusive" features arc 
by no means crucial. 

All in all. "The Rc,ll World You 
Never Saw: Chicago" is more or 
less equivalent to an extra episode 
of "The Real World Ch icago," 
albeit an extra-cuddly one, and is 
perfect for any member of the 
growin g "Real World" cult.

Undergrads offer dynamic 
new take on theater May 30 
UCSD actors present individual, short one-acts 
derived from their own life experiences 
By BRENT HECHT 
Staff Writer 

Pretentious playwrights and domineering directors will be conspicuously absent from 
UCSD's theater this weekend, and 
if Antonia Glenn, Amy Cook and, 
their troupe of undergraduate 
actors have their way, bored audi-
ences will be AWOL as well. 
Opening tonight, "0 Solo Walt 
Jones," Glenn and Cook's brain-
child, promises to offer UCSD 
audiences an entirely new theater-
going experience. The show, a set 
of short solo-performance pieces 
by UCSD undergraduates, is the 
first such show in which every piece 
was written and mostly directed by 
its performer. 

"These are unusually self-derived 
works ... [The show) is the only thing 
of its kind at UCSD - no one else is 
doing this," Cook said. 

Cook and Glenn organized the 
event and helped the actors in the 
writing and performing process, 
but did not take on a directing role. 

Actors in the show are equally 
enthralled with the show\; individuality. 

"It's an amazing privilege to have 
the opportunity to own the stage fo r 
a few minutes and share one's fee lings 
:1l1d viewpoints with the world," said 
actor Nawal Bcngolam. ~ [ t's a privi-
lege few people have." 

From actor Amanda Sitton's 
wry weight-loss video parody in 
which she proclaims that losing 
weight is one of the best ways to 
fight terrorism, to Andrew 
Kircher's eerie mu rder-filled tale 

of a vacation with guys gone-
wrong, the show covers comedy, 
tragedy and any range of emotions 
between the two. 

According to Glenn, each per-
formance piece stretches the cre-
ativity of its performer. 

"So much of acting training is 
insular," Glenn said . "Anytime 
duties are shared, one's perspective 
on theater is expanded. " 

Gle.nn and Cook begin helping 
the actors "expand perspectives on 
theater" at the beginning of spring 
quarter, when they led the troupe 
in brainstonning exercises. 

From there, the actors began 
writing pieces, a process which last-
ed several weeks. Glenn and Cook 
then paired the actors in twos and 
encouraged them to work together 
closely. Only recently did Glenn 
and Cook began meeting with the 
actors individually to fine-rune 
each performance. 

Actors were very positive about 
the help they received from the 
lead duo. 

"[Glenn and Cook] provided a 
whole lot of encouragement and 
pushed me in directions I woul dn't 
have gone otherwise." sa id actor 
Steve Fate. 

T he undiscovered direc tions of 
Fate and his fell ow actors in "0 
Solo Wa lt Jones" will be on display 
T hursday through Sunday in 
Galbraith 157 in Revelle College. 
Al l shows are free. An additional 
late nigh t perfo rmance featuring an 
expanded set of Amanda Sitton and 
Andrew Kircher 's works wi ll ru n

THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS II 

Garbage hits San Diego, then world 
Alternative rock group will perform sets from their third album 

By KEELY HYSLOP 
Staff writer 

Garbage has been doing a lot of traveling this year to su p-port their third album 
"Beautifulgarbage," released last 
year. Continuing their 2002 
North American tour, which 
began in Toromo on April 19th, 
Garbage will wrap up in San 
Diego and Los Angeles before 
proceeding to Mexico City. They 
will then be heading to Spain to 
begin a summer-long world tour 
taking them through several 
European countries, as well as 
Russia, before ending the tour in 
Montreux, Switzerland. Garbage 
will be playing at the SDSU Open 
Air Theatre on Friday May list. 
TIckets are already sold out. 

The band's lead singer, Shirley 
Manson, was born in Edinburgh, 
Scotland and can be characterized 
as a fiercely charismatic porcelain 
doll from hell . Her previous bands 
include Goodbye Mr. Mackenzie 

and Angelfish. Her mesmerizing 
stage presence and sultry vocals 
have kept Garbage's CD sales up 
and fans hungry for more. 
Manson isn't, however, just a pret-
ty face - she also has a passion for 
charity work and was recently 
named spokesperson for the Viva 
Glam IV AIDS Fund. 

Guitar and keyboard are pro-
vided by Duke Erikson and Steve 
Marker (whose beautiful electric 
guitars riffs are definitely not 
garbage). Their efforts provide 
just the right flavor for a delicious 
angst-ridden sound. 

Garbage's success can also be 
credited to their talented drum-
mer and producer, Butch Vig. In 
the early '90s, Vig became a big 
name in popular rock., working 
with such bands as U2 , Depeche 
Mode, Smashing Pumpkins and 
Nirvana . Vig is intimately 
involved in the mixing and record-
ing process for all of the band 's 
music, paying meticulous atten-
tion its texrure and feel. 

Another reason for the band's 
enduring popularity is hard work 
and pride in their music. When 
asked why the musical ability of 
many rock ban ds, parti~ul arl y punk 
bands, is looked down upon, Vig 
stated, "We love to be dysfunction-
al and we love to hate ourselves. In 
some ways, with bands that don 't 
practice. maybe that works to their 
benefit. They end up sounding 
inventive. But I appreciate working 
with musicians who take some 
pride in their craft." 

The new album is the fi rst on 
which Shirley Manson wrote the 
lyrics. Some of its singles include 
"Cherry Lips" and "Androgyny." 
Garbage'S new sound is much sim-
pler and perhaps even a little 
watered down, but the concert wi ll 
still featu re plenty of the old 
favorites such as "Stupid Girl " and 
"I T hink I'm Paranoid" to keep 
fans happy. If there's one thing 
G arbage does well. it's a live show, 
and fans have definitely come a 
running.

14 HIATIJS THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY. MAY 30. 2002 

Music: 
Artists will face the continued 
dispute over creative vision 
Continued from page 10 

embraced, there would be motiva-
tion to improve upon the sound 
quality of MPh. 

For fans of music outside of 
their home country, one can hope 
that pesky import taxes will be 
greatly reduced or e liminated 
because songs would become avail-
able on the World Wide Web. 
With the speed at which technolo-
gy is moving, record companies 
should continue to look to the 
future of how music can be 
released.

room for artwork. Albums that are 
released online have as much as 
space as the size of yOUT monitor 
allows for interactive or ani mated 
artwork. An artist can potentially 
have an album Web site with 
detailed artwork, hidden links to 
songs and information for fans to 
discover. Artists can release a set of 
songs and allow their fans to 
arrange the tracks in their preferred 
order and burn them on to a CD. 
This idea offers a unique way for 
fans to have a part in the music of 
their favorite musicians. With the 
structure of albums being trans-
formed. artists can prefer to have 
thei r track in specfic order or wi th-
out any order at all. Artists could be 
as open or mytserious as they would 
like to be if they were online. There 
is a sense of liberation on the 
Internet, where songs, photos, 
sleeve notes and art work can be 
fluid . 

The record labels should salivate 
over the idea of online albums. By 
saving money on the physical pro-
duction and distribution of CDs, 
record companies can invest more 
on finding and developing innova-
tive artists who are talented and 
unique enough to last for a long 
time without becoming stale. 
Albums can be released fairly inex-
pensively online, and they can be 
accessed by fans worldwi de ai_most 
instantaneously when completed 
ongs are uploaded onto the Web 

site. Press kits can come in the form 
of e-mails with links to a specific 
site. not to mention the fact that 
tons of paper can be saved . 

Fans would pay a small fee to 
purchase the rights to download 
the songs on to their computers. If 
the concept of online albums were 

The technology development 
will happen faster and these far-
fetched ideas are a lot closer than 
we think. We are only limited by a 
narrow creative vision. 

Meanwhile, the role of the lis-
tener is to embrace new styles of 
music. There are many local musi-
cians that deserve attention and 
there are many different styles of 
music all around the world that can 
be embraced . Fans of music should 
also look to embrace the music that 
influenced their favorite modern-
day artists. You may find yourself 
surprised at how much today's 
music is influenced by the past. 
The successful musicians and per-
formers are those who can take an 
old trick and make it look new. Past 
forms of music always influence the 
music that follows it. The key is to 
add a modern-day twiSt that makes 
the old, fami liar sound fresh and 
new. The key is to find out who 
does it right. 

It is ultimately up to the con-
sumers of the music because they 
can direct the way music - not to 
mention the way we listen to music 
- moves. We must attempt to push 
the quality of music, and the way 
we listen to and get our music, 
pushed in a forward direction. We 
must refuse to run in place. We can 
keep the major record labels being 
complacent and keep them running 
along with us. 

If they can't beat us, they'll have 
to join us.

our team but say 'I can't come 
up with that money to play,''' 
Casper said. "In general, I 
think we are all underfunded, 
and there should be more 
funding from the University to 
malee it easier for the average 
person to play." 

Club sport athletes are 
forced to work in order to play 

that they were an instrumental 
part of on of the most memo-
rable teams in school history. 

They were a part of the 
2000 Triton team that beat 
UC Berkeley (the current No. 
1 team in the country), and 
upset University of Southern 
California in last year's Final 
Four to play in the national 
championship game against 
UCLA 

"They will be remembered 
as juniors that started on the 

"Not only can people not 
afford it, they have to work 
even extra to pay, which is 
another time commitment," 
Dudani said. "And on top of 
that, we have to take out from 
practice time to do funrlrais-
ers." 

Overall, while most of the 
dub sports athletes were grate-
ful for what little funding they 
did receive, many felt there 
should be more. 

"Because we're representing 
the university and such, it'd be 
nice if we were paid for," Ball 
said. "We are somewhat limited 

2000 team that broke a lot of 
ground for this program," 
Harper said. 

The team still went a 
remarkable 20-7 in 2001 and, 
out of the seven losses, five 
were by only one point. 

This year is definitely noth-
ing to forget for them, either. 
All three players should be 
very proud of the legacy they 
leave behind and the examples 
they set for all the younger 
players. 

when we hold events on campus 
- we have to go through the 
university, which tends to raise 
the expenses. What it really 
hurts is those people who are 
trying it out for fun." 

"I think we're grossly under-
funded, personally," Casper said. 

This year, several club 
sports teams have gone to 
nationals to compete, includ-
ing women's ultimate disc and 
women's rugby. 

Now imagine what they 
collid do if they could focus 
solely on playing and forget 
about the money. 

Stoner: 
The quirky nature of sports 
columnists revealed 
Continued from p_ge 16 
columnist shambles to his computer 
early in the morning to ponder the finer 
dynamics of the complicated institution 
that is sports"). No, this will be an 
attempt to objectively look at the pur-
pose, the effect, the space between sports 
and the professional sports columnists 
fill in today's society. 

OK, I must begin with a little side 
note: I lied. In the previous paragraph, I 
said this would be an objective look at 
sports columnists, but I believe columns 
are supposed to have subjective matter 
(i .e., opinions) within them - that's a 
given. Opinion is inherent in any type of 
column, whether it is from the news, 
opinion, the community or the sports 
section . 

That said, I believe sports columns 
stand a little separate from other types of 
columns. First of all, the whole concept 
of a sports column seems oxymoronic: 
The world of sports is a fact-oriented 
one: one of endless stats, notes and odds. 
Indeed, the massive reams of numbers 
could bury many times over anyone try-
ing to disseminate it all. Yet, contrary to 
the idea of cold, hard, irrefutable facts, 
sports columnists offer opinions on these 
facts and the sports that should ideally be 
black and white, but are forever falling 
into the indistinguishable categories of 
gray. 

But I thinle the existence of sports 
columnists is justified, created, propa-
gated - validated, if you will - by the 
fatal flaw of facts: While they never lie, 
facts rarely tell the whole truth. Asle a 
baseball player who went O-for-4 but 
hit line drives every time how his day at 
the plate was, and he'll give you a com-
pletely different response than the bat-
ter who went 0-for-4 with four strike-
outs. 

Yet, both of them will have the same 
statistic in the boll score. 

Or ask the running back who has 
scored 10 touchdowns, all of them with 
runs of five yards or less. Or the player 
- Shaq, for example - who scored 40 
points, bur all of them from inside the 
Ieey, less than five feet from the hoop. 

For another example, take many of 
the UCSD athletic teams, most notably 
the men's volleyball team. This season 
the Tritons sported a dismal record, win-
ning only one league game. Yet they are 
playing some of the nation's elite 
Division I scholarship-laden teams, 
including UCLA and USC, among oth-
ers. 

SPORTS IS 

The fact is, when an umpire calls a 
strike, or a referee calls a foul or throws 
a fla g, there is room for interpretation . 

I believe it 's the responsibility of 
sports columnists to highlight those dif-
ferences; to delineate those shades of 
gray distinctly; to make those single-
dimension, boring, objective facts come 
to life; to b reathe vibrant color where 
the real meat of sports lies. 

Of course, others have their own 
opinions as ro what sports columnists 
should do. T he UCSD athletic depart-
ment, for instance, beli eves that 
columns, if they do exist. should "be lim-
ited to UCSD sports." 

( beg to differ, since, as sports ediror, 
I am trying to appeal to the gemral sru-
dent body's interests, which, as all the 
empty seats at UCSD sporting events 
attest, is not UCSD sports. ( believe the 
majority of the school's population is 
interested in sports outside of UCSD. 
The fact that columns generate the most 
reader responses reinforces this belief. 

Just a week or two ago, one of my 
fans told me to "Go suck a dick you 
fuckin' cunt" in response to my "I hate 
the Lakers" column. I've also been called 
a "fucking moron" by a curling fan (I 
didn't know those even existed) after I 
denigrated the Winter Olympics. 

I personally think each one of these 
responses is great. Each response, each 
insult thrown my way, means a reader 
was moved enough, touched enough, 
became involved enough in my column 
to reply to me. Not that I particularly 
enjoy all the insults, but they mean that 
people actually art reading my column 
and that I'm not JUSt pointlessly ram-
bling to nobody in an effort to fill space 
in the newspaper. 

I realize that trying to please every-
body in this business is nearly impossi -
ble. That's probably why I hate this job 
so much: I'm the type of person who 
just wants everyone to be happy, even

CLUB SPORTS CRuNcH 
ATHLETES Hp,VE MORE TO 

~~ORR"1 p,BOUTTHAN PLA"1 

By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Sports Editor 

Imagine having to pay hun-
dred or even thousands of doll ars 
to play the sport you love. 
Imagine knowing you have the 
talent to belong on the playing 
field with any other team in the 
nation, yet knowing your playing 
field is limited by the amount of 
money you have. These imaginary 
athletes have no suppOrt from 
their administration or their fel-
low students and play for the pure 
love of the game, nothing else .. . 
when they can afford it. 

Welcome to the world of club 
spons. 

"I'd say [I've spent] just about 
one thousand dollar [this year] ," 
said ballroom dance team captain 
Kevin Ball. 

UCSD snow and ski club presi-
dent Colin Casper also had to pony 
up personal funds. 

"Out of my pocket I've spent a 
lot ," Collin Casper said "Let's go 
with $2,000." 

Not only do these athletes bu t 
their humps on the field, but unlike 
player for the ational Collegiate 
Athletic Association intercollegiate 
teams, the club sport members must 
take care of their own travel , uni-
form, coaching and competition 
costs. Such needs often stretch out-

side of the meager budget allocated 
to each team by thousands of dollars. 

So in addition to worrying 
about their performances on the 
field, these athletes must worry 
about pinching every penny just so 
they COil play. 

For example, for the women's 
ultimate disc team, league dues 
and tournament entry fees alone 
cost $2,690; their tota l budget 
alloca ted to th em this year was 
$3,465 . That left $77 5 to cover 
travel costs, coaches' salary, uni-
forms, equipment and upplies. 
The team's tOtal budget came to 
over $13,000, meaning the 
Psycaughtits had to supply over 
$9,500 to cover the whole team's 
expenses. 

"It comes a little bit at a time, so 
it doesn't seem that bad," said 
women's lacrosse team captain 
Megan Wemmer. "But it adds up." 

Think that's bad? The ice 
hockey team's expenses include 
$14,300 for ice time, $2 ,240 fo r 
referees, $5 ,100 for transporta-
tion and hotel costs, $2,000 for 
coaches, $1 ,250 for league fees 
and $8,000 for nationals. In all, 
their total expenses come to 

Kenrick Leung/Cuardian 

$32,890. The money they receive 
for these expenses was only 
$6,391.63 . 

That means the 28 players on 
the ice hockey team each had to 
spend $946.37. However, even this 
number isn't completely accurate, 
because as the season wears on and 
players drop off the team, the cost 
per player of combined fees such as 
ice time and referees increases. 

"I'd say I spent probably $575 in 
initial dues; we went to nationals, 
so $400 in plane ticket~. We also 
had to pay for our own food, so for 
a total I'd say well over $1,000," 
said Scott Freidman, current mem-
ber of the ice hockey team. 

T hese exorbiant costs have 
forced club athletes to become 
smart with their money. 

"We practice late at night and 
have our games late at night, which 
saves money [on ice time fees)." 
Freidman said. 

Ball also had to find ways to cut 
costs. 

"We took vans to Las Vegas," 
Ball said . "We tried to stay in the 
least expensive hotels and got 

bulk suppl ier COS ts for shoes . 
There are only so many things we 
can do." 

A lot of teams try to stem high 
travel costs by avoiding hotels alto-
gether. 

"We always scrounge up a place 
to stay," Wemmer said. "When we 
went up to Stanford, we stayed 
with one ofthe player's families." 

Casper has a different solution 
to saving money. 

"We rent a house 111 
Mammoth," he said. "It actually 
costs [several thousand dollars] less 
to rent a house than get a hotel. 
When we travel to regionals, we 
don't stay at hotels, we stay at a 
players' parents house. At the end 
of the season, we cram 10 to 12 
people in a hotel room for four." 

Unfortunately for some teams, 
cutti ng corners isn 't enough and 
they are deprived of certain 
adva ntages their competitors 
have. 

"We choreographed a lot of our 
own stuff, and we don't have a 
coach, and we didn't have a profes-
sional do our music," Dudani said. 

This forces athletes to take 
over a lot of the administrative 
components of running a sports 
team. 

"We pretty much run the team 
ourselves," Friedman said. "We try 
and get fundraisers together - this 
year we initiated a sponsorship 
program." 

More importantly, some teams 

Water polo loses huge trio to graduation 
Allan, Djapic and All-American Samuels say goodbye 
By MAn RYAN 
Staff Writer 

Being one of the TDost dominant 
teams on campus (with arguably the 
best athletes), UCSD mens water 
polo is fit to handle even tile best at 
the Division I level. 

T hree players that are largely 
responsible for the team's success 
will be leaving UCSD by the end 
of this quarter: Jonathan Samuels, 
Vladimir Djapic and Brett Allan. 

The heart and sole of the team 
has been Jonathan Samuels. H e 
compiled an unprecedented 184 
goals throughout hi s illustrious 
career at the two-meter offense 
position. 

Water polo head coach Denny 
Harper sings Samuel's praises, 
calling him "One of the most 
dominant players we have ever had 
here at UCSD." 

The awards that Samuels has 
received only further prove his 
greatness. The long list includes 
two-time conference MVP and 
nomination to the All-American 
Second Team in Division I. 

Samuels graduated from 
UCSD this past Decervber and 
wasted no time getting right 
back into hi game. He is now 
pla yi ng professionally in 
Europe. 

Along with Samuels, the great 
play ofVladirnir Djapic boosted the 
Tritons. Djapic became an integral 
component of the Triton team after

transferring &om UCLA 
"Vlade has that European flare, 

he is a super exciting player. He 
gave us four outstanding years 
after he transferred," Harper said. 

Djapic tallied up 143 goals in 
his four years as a utility player, 
but also contributed in other 
aspects of the game for UCSD. 

"His leadership was crucial," 
Harper said. 

Djapic actually graduated in 
the 200 1 school year, but was eligi-
ble to play for the team in the fall. 
Now he embarks on a new journey 
in his life and leaves UCSD with

many memories of his hard work 
and perseverance. 

Last but definitely not least is 
senior Brett Allan. Allan was a key 
player for the Tritons, but unfortu-
nately had his senior year cut short 
after a lot of hard work. Brett was 
declared ineligible by UCSD. 

"It is very unfortunate . He 
was leading us in scoring and 
was a great outside shooter," 
Hrper said. "The incident 
occurred in August and he was 
declared ineligible, but the team 
was not told until right before 
the conference championships.

This happened at a very poor 
time for us and was very punitive 
if you ask me." 

The Tritons ended up losing 
the conference championship to 
Loyola Marymount University 4-
2. Allan finished his season with 
37 goals, and, as the primary 2-
meter defender, he was obviously 
a key loss for the Tritons. 

"It took us a while to recover 
from that blow," Harper said . 
"With him, many observers 
believe we would have won our

are forced to sacrifice oppornmities 
to compete due to lack of funding. 

"This year we didn't go to 
Florida [to compete]," Dudani 
said . "And the team has gone 
every year since I don 't know 
when." 

Teams also give up quality 
scheduling due to lack of money. 

"[More money] would improve 
out standing in leagues," Friedman 
said . "Because you don 't playas 
many teams, which hurts your 
chances to improve." 

According to Casper, the ski 
and snowboard team won't buy 
enough spots in thei r competitions 
for all their members to avoid hav-
ing to pay the high entry costs and 
having players drop out. 

"[We] don't buy enough slot 
positions, so not everyone is guar-
anteed to race," Casper said. 

Perhaps the worst effect the 
expensive nature of club sports has 
is the effect on potential players. 

"We had two players this season 
who took a break and weren't able 
to play due to money," Friedman 
said. "Fortunately, they were able 
to raise money through relatives 
and are working to come back for 
nationals." 

Casper agrees tllat the money 
poses a problem for interested 
players. 

"I know that for sure I've had 
people really, really interested in
