Some Groups Disappointed 

Panel Sends .Budget to Coop 
The Student Cooperative Union's 

budgetary support groups has ' 
announced its proposed allocations 
for the fall programming and 1976-
77 operating budgets of student 
organizations. 

The Student Activity Fee Su~ 
por Gi'oujrs' (SAFS(,; r btl~tal'Y 
proposals - from money paid by 
UCSD students as part of their $6-
quarterly activity fees - were the 
foc us of last Monday's Coop 
meeting. 

The proposed allocations have 
also been the focus of protests from 
many student organizations which 
eit.her did not receive funding or 
received less money than they 
requested. 

SAFSG members answer these 
charges by pointing to a . fund 
shortage - the support groups had 

only $16,500 in funds, with $80,000 in 
fund requests. As SAFSG coor-
dinator Susan Karpinski noted on 
the budget proposals sheet, "We 
realize that many people were 
disappointed, but it would be 
impossible to please everyone." 

Student Lobby DisappOtnteiJ 
One of the most disappointed 

groups is the Coop's External 
Affairs Support Group, which 
requested $7,500. $5,000 would have 
gone to UCSD's annex of the UC 
Student Lobby, which is the 
legislative lobbying arm of the 
Student Body Presidents' Council. 
As it stands now, External Affairs 
has been inked in for $1,100 in 
funding. 

" I can understand their (SAF-
SG's) problems in deciding which 
groups get msmey," said R~n Bee

of External Affairs, "but I can't 
help thinking that they went about 
it in the wrong manner. The UC 
Student LQbby is ranked among the 
top ten lobbying organizations in 
the state. Through the Lobby, 
legislators hear those matters 
(Jerti'llentW stttdent affairs: eare 
losing our voice in the legislature." 

Bee and UGSD Student Lobby 
annex coordinator Jeff Marx, 
pointed out that the Lobby has been 
working on such issues as the Reg 
Fee question and Third College 
Step II. By not funding the lobby, 
they say "We are pulling our 
support from vital issues." 

"Our influence as a campus will 
definitely be diminished," said 
Bee. "Further, the Lobby deals 
with money affairs , and it's quite 
possible that without them our 
monetary supplies in the future 
wilrbe greatly diminished." 

Because of this, the Ext~rnal

Facu,lty Vote Against 
Swi·tch to Semesters 

by Alec Nedelman 
Associate News Editor 

The UCSD faculty has voted against the University of California 
changing its academic year from three quarters to two semesters, it was 
announced Tuesday during a meeting of "the San Diego Division of the 
Academic Senate . 

A su~committee of the Academic Senate, the Executive and Policy 
Commlttee, reported the results of a non-binding "straw vote" ballot sent 
to over 700 faculty. The ballot, in addition to the question on the switch 
from quarters to semesters, also polled the faculty on the issue of whether 
the semester system, if implemented, should end before or after 
Christmas. 

Of the 298 faculty responding, 46 percent favored a change to two 
semesters, while 54 percent opposed the switch. 62 percent of the faculty 
preferred a semester ending before Christmas; 38 percent preferred it 
ending after the Christmas break. 

- Systemwide Debate 
The question of a possible change to semesters is being discussed on all 

of the UC campuses. The impetus for this debate was a resolution 
proposed at the June 8, 1976 meeting of the Berkeley Representative 
Assembly of the Berkeley Division of the Academic Senate. According to 
the minutes of that meeting, the resolution, which passed by "an over-
whelming majority," calls for ''The Berkeley campus (to ) return as soon 
as possible to the Semester system in an academic ca lendar in which the 
fall semester ends before Christmas." 

.A~~ording to Her~ert York, Chairman of Academic Senate, San Diego 
DIVISion, UC PreSident Saxon would only institute the change on a 
systemwide basis. Further, he will not institute the change, scheduled for 
fall 1978, " unless the change has substantial b'acking of the faculty." 
However, York said, Saxon has not defined what he means by "sub-
stantial. " 

Thus far, faculty at the Irvine, Los Angeles, Berkeley, Santa Barbara 
and Riverside campuses have already voted either officially or by straw 
vote to implement the semester system. Balloting is currently underway 
at the other campuses. 

In early December, at an assemblage of representatives from all UC 
• academic senates, .the discussion will con ·nue. The geQeral thru t of the 
straw vote at UCSD will be conveyed at this meeting, along with the 
results from the other campuses. However, York emphasized that there 
is no assurance a vote at the December meeting will produce a specific 
result. 

Faculty Comment 
Attendance at Tuesday 's meeting, during which one-half hour was 

devoted to this issue, varied between sixty and seventy as faculty drifted 
in and out to make comments or listen to remarks from others. Some of 
the comments included: 

" I haven 't heard any good reasons to change. Midterms come at 
midterm under either system. Neither system is responsible for student 
pressure." 

" Students under the quarter system will be exposed to more of our 
eminent faculty ." 

" Since undergraduates always vote for quarters, how can we say we 
are switching to help students?" 

"Logistically, three registration periods, three final exams, three of 
everything is very wasteful of faculty and student time." 

" Semester question is not that crucial to students. It won't cure pimples 
or bring,peace." 

" Semester system does allow students more time to reflect on work, 
more time for independent research, more time for writing." 

This does not mean, however, 
that law schools do not require 

"Law sc~ools. do not can! what a specific skills. Berkeley, UCLA

Teachers Ask Students Home for Dinner 
by Paul Watry 
Staff Writer 

It's not that the professors at 
UCSD are so distant, it 's just 
that there has never been much 
reason for students and faculty 
to get together. 

At least that's what Muir 
student Fernando Roth thought 
as he initiated his "Faculty 
Home Visitation" program - a 
plan that anows faculty and 
students to meet each other in 
the social atmosphere of a 
professor's home. 

" Informal Atmospbere ' 
"The Student and Faculty 

Visitation program gives an 
opportunity for students to talk 
to professors in the informal 
and personal atmos:>here of 
their home," explain Roth. 
" It's a chance for students and 
faculty to ask each other 

questions and discuss things 
that are not asked in class or 
during office hours. " 

Through the home visitation 
program, students and faculty 
can communicate on a level 
other than the strict studenV 
teacher, sit down/stand up 
relationship. This is ac-
complished by arranging visits 
to professors' homes for a 
" social" evening. The visits 
usually are scheduled to last 
two hours, but frequently go 
beyond this time limit because 
the evening becomes so in-
teresting. 

" This program ," claims 
Roth, " is designed to enhance 
the sen e of community at 
UCSD. Other colleges, like 
B rkeley, enabl students and 
faculty to m t informally 
tog ther. This informality 
mi ing at U D." 

Enhancing Experience 
Roth thinks that a program 

such as this enhances one's 
educational experience. ee l 
think we can learn more from 
the professors than from what 
they teach in class," said Roth. 
"I know that I learned a great 
deal of information about how to 
get by academically in school 
and a few inside things about 
how a university works. In 
addition, we had a chance to 
discuss eat'h of our own per-
sonal goals ,n college. We talked 
about what w wanted to get out 
of college and why we were 
there. " 

Th program, which has 
end d for thi quarter, may be 
initiated again in th lI-t 
quart r . Ann uncement will b 
placed in th Triton Times and

Feminists Plan Abortion Debate 

for $1.19 
Tuesday Night Only with this ad 

Offer expires Dec. 31. 197.6 

The Feminist Coalition believes 
it is both the right and the 
responsibility of every woman to 
decide whether and when to have a 
child. The decisien for or against 
abortion should rest solely between 
the woman and her physician 
\{;thout legal encwnberances. 
.u. 1rtion care should be available 
a~ a reasonable cost, and should be 
equally available to all women, 
regardless of economic status, age 
or marital status. /' 

Two weeks ago a slH:alled 
" right-ta-life" group sponsored a 
debate at San Diego State, at· 
tended by 200 people. The Feminist 
Coalition also will sponsor a 
debate on abortion rights early 
next quarter. We need women who 
are willing to provide a lot of 
energy into the event. 

Printing of a leaflet, distribution, 
banners, articles to be written, are 
aU essential tasks. Leave your 

name and phone nwnber in the 
Women's Center. We want to begin 
during the vacation. An Abortion 
Coalition has formed in San Diego, 
and we want to be a part or it. 
Campus women are intrinsic to the 
success of any struggle in San 
Diego.

Scientists at UC San Diego have 
applied for federal money to 
finance recombinant DNA 
research qn this campus. Although 
proponents hope for benefits, they 
admit the research entails great 
environmental and health risks . 

Citizens For Safe Research 
(CSR) is a group of concerned 
people who believe decisions 
regarding this controversial area 
of research must take into account 

. thc risks it poses to the community. 
Our central concern is that the 
public has the right to know and the 
right to contribute to the final 
policy decision which will affect 
their well-being. 

To this end, CSR will act to raise 
the' level of public awareness and 
provide infonnation on potential 
risks and benefits, opening a 
dialogue on the possible social and 
ethical consequences or recom-
binant DNA research. As the first

FINAL EXAMINATION 
Read both sections carefully before attempting to write your essays. Do 

not fear that this exam may cost you your trip to medical schooL Relax. 
It's only 50 percent of your grade and your future Mercedes. 

SeetIoDA 
I waited anxiously in line. It was hard to remember back to the times 

when I was happy - the days before I was hooked. Such thoughts hurt me. 
My turn finally came. The doctor looked suspiciously at me. "Haven't I 

seen you before?" he asked. 
I cowered. "Of course not," I answered. "Who would want to get more 

than one swine flu shot?" 
The man in white mwnbled, and then injected me. The rush was such 

that I could hardly stand the ecstasy. "Hit me again," I moaned. " Hit me 
again." 

And I knew then that the United States government had made me an 
addict dependent on swine flu vaccine. It was already a two shot a day 
habit. I wondered how many others had been trapped into the hell I was 
living. 

SectlonB 
I sat waiting in the class, anxious to have the trial speed reading course 

get underway. At last the instructor arrived. He was garbed in black, and 
moved quickly to the podium. "Do you believe you can improve your 
reading by 500 percent," he shouted. " Do you believe !" 

"I believe! "I screamed. 
"Do you think you can leave this room ten weeks from now and be able 

to read Jaws in an hour?" 
"I think I can leave tonight and read it in half an hour!" I yelled. 
The instructor liked my enthusiasm. He began his spiel. I understood 

what he was saying. I threw away my glasses. I saw the light. 
"Give me a book! .. I caterwauled. 
He gave me a book. I read it in thirty seconds. I learned everything I 

had always wanted to know about the aphid's mating habits. 
"Another!" I yelled. And then I really began -to read. " War and 

Peace," " MOOy Dick," "Boswell's Life of Johnson," "Spidennan nwnber 
143," and hundreds of other texts - all read in a mater of minutes. I 
turned the pages so quickly as to ignite them into fire. 

" More!" I bellowed. 
"There are no more," the instructor said fearfully. 
I stomped out, knowing my destination to be Central Library . Everyone 

in the class knew it too. They sent for the National Guard and the 
Marines. 

I made it through three divisions before they stopped me. Of course I 
read the nametag of each rmn that I knocked down. 

And now I only ha ve my prison nwnber to read. 
Select ODe oflhe follow questions pertaining to Section A and .K You

Section A 

I ) - Why is "Swine Flu" considered one of the greatest short pieces in 
literature? 

2) - Som/critics believe that Russell was a psychotic. Others are sure 
of it. Can you see anything to indicate this in his famed " Swine Flu" 
essay? 

3) - Rwnors have it that Russell was deeply into drugs - especially 
ascorbic acid . From this story can you draw out any such inferences? 

SectlonB . 
1) - Why have some compared Russell's "Speed Reader" with 

Shakespeare's "Hamlet?" 
2) - Professor Andrew Wright"noted literary critic, wrote of "Speed 

Reader" in glowing terms. He called it a " systematic expository work

while foregoing the sophistic elements or excessive jargon in mounting

1. What is your committee doing 
at the present time to inform the

What's 
Up? 

by Dr. Littleman 
This being the tenth week of 

publication and the last week of 
the fall quarter, we've been 
asked a questio.n by our auditor 
we'd like you to answer -
Should the Doctor continue 
practicing next quarter? Mail, 
call or bring in all responses to 
the TT office by Wednesday. 
Results will be printed In the 
finals week issue next Monday. 

Also in that issue we will print 
our readers' suggestions as to 
why those four girls from last 
week aren't being asked out. 

Dear Doc: You have got to 
help me. lam ID love with tbis 
chick but dOD't know anythlDg 
about her except she Is a 
reporter for the Triton TImes 
lind Is eligible. Sbe', a cute 
brunette. I bear. there are some 
other foxy chlcb 811 the 1"1' 
staff. 

Again we are faced with a 
question "here more In-
fonnatlon is needed. Is her hair 
long or short? There are several 
cute brunettes working for the 

Triton Times, all of whom 
might be eligible for the right 
offer. A more detailed 
description is needed for our 
investigation. 

Dear Doc: What is " hunting," 
as referring to a sport between 
teams of UCSD students played 
in the wee hours ID the forest? 

"Hunting" is played in teams 
or free-for-all . What happens is 
a bunch of maniacs, in dark 
commando-type clothes, stalk 
each other on Muir campus in 
the dead of night. They are 
armed with PVC blowpipes and 
darts made from rolled 
magazine pages. Occasionally 
innocent bystanders get in the 
line of fire, which accounts for 
the large nwnber of freshmen 
bodies discovered each morning 
on Muir commons. 

Dear Doc: Where do you feel 
would be the best location for a 
two-gun [50 calibre] em-
placement at UCSD for the 
upcoming revolution agalnlt 
violence aud bloodshed? 

This question is more com-
plex than it looks. Relying 
solely on a MG emplacementis -
a poor defensive posture. The 
fixed machine guns should also 
be supported by infantry. As 
re~ards the choice of calibre, 
thirty (7.62 mm) would be 
better. This calibre is easier to 
use and is almost as effective In 
both range and penetration. 

The consensus best choice as 
to location would be the central 
library, with a one-gun em-
placement at the second floor 
entrance and another at the 
first floor loading docks. Then, 
with infantry patrols aroWld the 
building you should have a 
fairly defensible position. If the 
upper stories are to be held, we 
would . suggest mounting 
grenade IaIUlChers or light 
mortars to hold the open third 
noor area. The mushroom 
structure should make an ex-
cellent oblervation post and 
strong hold. Good luck on the 
revolution. 

"After today, DotlliDC "HI be 
the lIIJIle agalD." Dr. Ut-
tlemaD.

Hastings Takes UCSD Invitational,Tritons Third 

Gardner Stuns USI U With No Time left 
. by Scott Sadn 
sport. Editor 

The fann boys took the turkey. 
A group of big rugged 

Nebraskans from Hastings College 
plowed through some California 
homegrown basketball teams to 
ea rn the top spot in the UCSD 
Basketball Invitational held over 
the Thanksgiving weekend in the 
Main Gym, 

Host school UCSD came out of 
the four-team tournament with a 
split of two close games and some 
indications of the team's strengths 
and weaknesses for the upcoming 
season. 

••••• 

The Broncos from Hastings, led 
by Paul Bergman, the tour-
nament's most valuable player, 
and all·tourney selections Doug 
Sweeney and Ken McKeone, 
defeated USIU, 71-62, in their 
opening contest and held on to beat 
Cal Lutheran, 70-66, in the 
championship game. 

Bergman, a poweriul 6'8" 240 
powid center with a soft shot · 
around the basket, scored 57 points 
in his team's two victories. 
Sweeney was Bergman's main 
offensive support in Hastings' first 
win and McKeone totaled 30 points 
in the championship game. 

In that game. Cal Lutheran, 
after falling behind 27-41 at the end 
of the first half, were carried back 
by the shooting of Ray Fields to tie 
the scor.e with two minutes 
remaining in the contest before 
Hastings was able to put the game 
away. 

Fields, another all-tourney pick, 
scored 17 second-baH points in the 
Kingsmen's comeback bid. 

••••• 

For UCSD It was a weekend of 
catch-up baaketbaU. 

In its opening game against Cal 
Lutheran the Tritons feU behind by 
as many as It points in the first 
half before fighting back within 2 

late in the contest. The outside 
shooting of freshman guard, Tom 
Omalev put UCSD this close. But 
Cal Lutheran, much stronger along 
the front line than the Tritons, was 
able to work the baD to the inside 
for enough baskets to hold off 
UCSDs challenge, 74-70, 

All -Tourney selection Tom Omalev 
(IT phOlo: Nllthlln Meyers) 

Against USlU, a team UCSD has 
had many close contests with over 
the yean, it was ' not W1til Lee 
Gardner's two clutch free throws 
with no time left on the game clock 
that the Tritons finaDy took a lead 
in the game, 72-71, and their first 

1976 victory, UCSD had been 
behind by as many as 16 points in 
this game_ 

"That was a good win for us, one 
that we needed," said UCSD coach 
Dick Satterlee after the USIU 
game. " The guys were a little 
down after last night, but they kept 
playing their game, they stayed 
patient and together, and it worked 
out well. It 

Omalev pumped in 21 points 
against USIU and was selected to 
the all-tourney team. The Tritons 
other starting guard, Ken Melvin, 
also had a good tournament, 
scoring 25 points, handing out 14 
assists, and making 8 steals in the 
two games. It appears that UCSD 
will be calling on these two guards 
for much of the team's offensive 
attack. " We have two guards that 
can keep us in a game," says 
Satterlee. 

The play of the Tritons frontline 
was on and off all weekend. At 
center, Lyle Smith perfonned 
adequately , but was never able to 
assert himself against the 
physically stronger opposition. 
Gardner, starting at one forward, 
averaged the ten-plus points the 

. Tritons will need from him, but 
was not much of a factor on the 
boards, especially at the offensive 
end. Bob Frazier, the other star-
ting forward, played well defen-
sively, but was erratic on offense. 
Slxthman Lee Brockett had two 
strong games off the bench, and 
may provide some of the 
rebounding strength that UCSD is 
now lacking. Substitute, center 
Gerald Humphrey also rebounded 
well, pulling down 12 caroms in two 
limited appearances, but was 
forced out of the USIU game with a 
sprained ankle and it is not yet 
known how long he will be out of 
action. 

The Tritons played very steady 
and organized basketball for so 

Badminton Team Takes Division 
After three consecutive close-but-no-cigar seasons 

the UC badm~nton finally took an outright divisio~ 
championship by defeating Grossmont College last 
Tuesday, 8-5,1n the SDWIAC playoff competition. 

~n the first three yean since intercollegiate bad-
mtnton was started at UCSD, the Tritons have twice 
finished in second place and once tied for first. 

Going into Tuesday 's playoff match, UCSD was tied 
for the league lead with Grossmont each tearn 
carrying a 5-1 record. The teams had split two 
meetings earlier in the year, 

The Tritons, picking up wins in men's, women's, 
and doubles play, took the rubber-game of the two 
team's three-game series to secure their first league 
flUe. 

"This year it was a total te~ effort," said UCSD 
coach Judy Sweet after the match. " 25 players 
worked and played together for the ultimate goal." 

Joe Starvish and John Cox each won their men's 

WANTED 

singles matches in straight games. 
In women's doubles, Liz Noll and Carol Steinberg 

were extended to three games before taking their 
match. 

OCSD ,received a free match when Grossmont's 
number one men's double team defaulted, Dan 
Verkin and Harry Yen picked up another point for the 
Tritons from the second men 's doubles position. 

In mixed doubles the UCSD teams of Gary Kreitzer 
and S~einberg, Lynette Budde and Cox, and Edy 
Nakahiro and Kent Schwitkis each won their matches 
to secure the overa~ victory for the 'r'ritons. 

It was a satisfying season for the Tritons 
especially for those players who had been on the tea~ 
for the past two or three years. " Our motto this 
season was 'Climb A Mountain' ," summed up coach 
Sweet. " We not only climbed that mountain we 
scaled it! " '

A life can be ~ved by donating 
blood to the Camj>US Blood Reserve 
Fund this Tuesday and Wed-
nesday. 

Blood can be donated by anyone 
between the ages of 17 and 65 at 
any of these locations: Tuesday 
from 11 am to 3 pm in the Revelle 
Community Center, Wednesday 
from 11 am to 3 pm in Matthews 
conference room lll-A, or Wed-
nesday from 9 am to 2 pm in 
Scripps Service Yard. 

The drive is organized to provide 
blood for students, staff, and their 
immediate families in times of 
emergency. UCSD also shares its 
fund with the San Diego Blood 

Budgets . .. 
might argue the necessity for more 
Iunding. " At Monday's (tonight's) 
Coop meeting we're going to 
readvocate our position," said 
Marx. "We feel students should 
come to the meeting, as it affects 
aU UCSD students, hear our 
positions, and understand the 
ramifications if we don't get the 
money." 

In response to External Affairs 
complaints, SAFSG scheduled a

Clark, in comparing UCSD with 

other major universities, found no 
differences in the preparation of 
entering law students. She believed 
that it was the individual student 

. who made the difference, not the 
university . 

" The people who were at the 
very top of the class (at 
Georgetown) were from colleges I 
had never heard of," shesaid.

rate place, academically," told a 
story about a UCSD graduate who

daily to meet its demands. In the 
last drive 150 donors were 
recruited. This time, however, it is 
hoped that more people will par-
ticipate in the drive. 

The donation procedure requires 
about 15 minutes. To avoid lines 
and waiting, appointments can be 
made by calling Jeannine in ihe 
Employment Development 
Center or by signing up in the 
Revelle, Muir, Third, or Fourth 
College Dean's office. 

The body contains 10 to 12 pints 
of blood, and can replace a pint 
within a 24 hour period. Therefore,

deal can be gained - a life can be 
saved.

Approval for the proposed budget

was apprehensive about attending 
NYU because 80% of his com-

schools such as Cornell, Harvard 
and Yale. But, to the UCSD

that those people were any better

education, or given more OJ}-
