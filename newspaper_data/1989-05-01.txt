A.S. Elections 
Raise Posting 
Policy Issues 
By CATHERINE DILLE 
Staff Writer 

In the aftermath of the A.S. 
elections, many candidates and 
election officials said that a more 
unified set of posting policies and 
regulations would be beneficial. 

Other than prohibiting candi-
dates from posting material in 
certain areas such as classrooms, 
sidewalks and vehicles, the cur-
rent A.S. election bylaws leave

examination of the A.S. election pro-
ceu. Part one appeared April 24. 

most posting regulations up to 
the individual colleges. 

This year's A.S. election candi-
dates received a packet with a list 
of regulations for each campus. 
All five colleges required that 
candidates have the approval of 
the colleges's resident dean's offi-
ces before posting or distributing 
any campaign materials. Candi-
dates received additional instruc-
tions as to where and what they 
could post when they checked in 
with the resident dean of each 
college. 

Several ofthis year's candidates 
felt that a unified set of posting 
rules would help prevent election 
violations. 

A.S. Elections Manager Julia 
Ramirez thought a unified post-
ing policy would be a "very good 
idea." 

"A lot of candidates were 
thrown off by the colleges's 6iif-
ferent rules," Ramirez said. "The 
problems arise when a student

Activists Protest Use 
of Animals in Research 
By CYNTHIA CHESY 
Staff Writer 
Two hundred to 300 people 

met yesterday at the Basic Science 
Building to participate in the San 
Diego Animal Advocates' 
(SDAA) protest of the use of 
animals in UCSD medical labs 
and classrooms. 

Speeches by animal rights acti-
vists, including local deejay Jerry 
St. James, began the protest. Pro-
testers then erected a mock grave-
yard for the dead laboratory 
animals. 

After the demonstration at the 
Basic Science Building, the group 
marched to the Price Center and 
other locations on campus, in-
cluding the Faculty Club. 

Yesterday's protest marked the 
sixth year that the 500 member 
SDAA has protested at UCSD. 
AccordingtoSDAA member Jane 
Cartmill, the group's primary goal 
is to support reform and to work 
toward the complete abolition of 
all animal experimentation. 

"There are no local, state or 
federal laws that protect animals 
during the course of experiments," 
Cartmill said. 

She continued that the Animal 
Welfare Act, administered by the 
United States Department of 
Agriculture, addressed only the 
size and cleanliness of the anim-
al's cages, storage of food, bed-

ding, and temperature control. 
However, he pointed out that 

these regulations do not apply to 
rodents, birds, or farm animal . 

Cartmill said that alternative 
methods to animal experimenta-
tion exist, but that the industrie 
who market animal research de-
vices have financial interests that 
necessitate the continued use of 
laboratory animals. 

According to Cartmill these 
industries include breeders of test 
animals; companies that market 
cages and kennels; industries that 
market medical and surgical in-
struments; and pharmaceutical 
companies that use animals in 
drug tests to ensure that new pro-
ducts work as intended. 

Cartmill said that the use of 
new laboratory practices is block-
ed by scientists' resistance to 
change and by the fact that these 
high tech computer models are 
expensive and time consuming to 
learn to use. 

She predicted that in "Ies than 
20 years, it will be considered an 
embarrassment for researchers to 
admit they were using animals for 
research in 1989." 

Animals that have been bred 
and genetically altered are cur-
rently bought and used in research 
labs at UCSD. 

The Animal Subjects Commit-
tee here reviews all the research 
See DEMONSTRATION, pale 7 

A.S . President-elect John 
Ramirez, on the problems that 
candidates faced in following the 
different posting policies, said that 
"Some students want to do every-
thing possible that is legal. It 
would be a lot easier if there was 
one uniform policy so everyone 
knows the guidelines." 

Rush Event Leads to Room Use Policy Review 

"This year," he conti ned, "we 
had to do a lot of research. We 
really had to go out of our way [to 
find out the rules] .. , but when 
you guess [about what the posting 
policies are] you can really get 
yourself into trouble." . 

Alina Zirino, a candidate for 
the position of academic affairs 
commissioner who later withdrew 
from the race, also felt that the 
differing rules complicated cam-
paigning. 

"It's so difficult to adhere to all 
of [the different rules]. It makes it 
very hard to get out to all the 
voters." she said . 

Mishka Migacz, a candidate 
for vice president external who 
wa later disqualified because of 
campaign violations. said that 
even though "it would have been 
ea ier for [candidates] if we had 
all the material in one packet, it' 
our responsibility to go to each 
campu and find out what the 
rule are."

ASUCSB Freezes Daily Nexus Funds 
Over Alleged Violation of Bylaws 

A TA BARBARA - The UCSB Associated 
Student have frolen approximately $13,000 of the 
Dail" exus' constitutional lock-i n allocation pending 
the A.S. Judicial Council's decision on Lehr vs. Daily 
Nexus, according to ASUC B Executive Director 
Tamara Scott. 

A.S. Internal Vice President David Lehr alleged 
that the exus' 15-year-old practice of endor ing the 
A.S. candidates violate A.S . bylaws. Lehr charged . 
that thi violation should prevent the A.S. from pro-
viding funds to that newspaper. 

The funds were frozen at the direction of Scott 
after she received a memorandum from Nexus Editor-
in-Chief Patrick Whalen and ASUCSB Communica-
tion Director Joe Kavach requesting the spring quar-
ter portion of the exus allocation. 

The funds were frozen under an A.S. bylaw which 
states that if an organization receiving A.S . funds uses 
that money to support or endorse a candidate for 
A .. office. "A.S. hall freeze the funding of the said 
group and refer to the Judicial Council for further 
action." 

The Judicial Council hearing of Lehr vs. Daily 
Nexus is set for sometime during the week of May 7, 
depending on sched ul ing constraints.

UCSB Students Halt Dialogue With 
Administration, Resume Hunger Strike 

UCSB Chancellor Barbara Uehling, clarifying 
previous statement on the subject of the ethnicity 
requirement, aid on April 19 that he upports a one-
course ethnicity general education requirement. 
Uehling added that the requirement alone will not be 
enough to educate students on racial d iversity and she 
reminded students of the fact that the change in 
curriculum will have to be approved by the faculty 
legislature. 

Uehling also encouraged changes in the general 
curriculum to include more study of ethnic minoritie 
and women's i sues. 

As Uehling discussed her po itions, the hallway 
leading to her office was packed with more than 40 
students, some of whom have resumed a hunger strike 
calling for 23 demands, including the implementation

of an ethnicity requirement. 

About 10 students resumed the hunger trike, 
which lasted 12 days during winter quarter and drew 
campus and media attention to what some perceive as 
a lack of student power on campus and also to et hn ic 
diversity-related issues. 

The original hunger strike was called off March 4 
in favor of negotiations. However, on April 20, the 
students broke from the meetings, charging that the 
administration was not engaging in "meaningful 
dialogue" a had been promi ed . 

In addition to resuming the hunger strike, 18 
people sat in the North Hall Computer Center for 
more than two hours yesterday to how their "poten-
tial power to grind the University to a halt ," accord-
ing to a statement read by protester Allison Tom. The 
group left the building after the six th warni ng from 
the center' manager and police, who said the students 
were to be arrested upon the reading of a seventh

VCI Academic Senate Votes to Add 
Course in Cultural/Intl Studies 

IR VINE - At UCI, the Academic Senate voted 
unanimously April 13 to add courses in multi-<ultural 
and international studies to the breadth requirements 
of incoming fresh persons. 

The Senate also approved a mandatory four-<ourse

V CI Student Minority Group Leaders 
Announce Drive to Remove UC Pres. 

I R VINE - At UCI, an angry group of student 
minority leaders demanded more minority faculty and 
student at the school and more financial support 
from the administration in an unprecedented meet-
ing on April 10 with UCI Chancellor Jack Peltason 
and other official. 

Calling themselves the Commi ttee for Student 
Empowerment. representatives from MEChA. the 
Black Student Union. the Gay and Lesbian Student 
Union and the Associated Graduate Students also 
announced a petition drive to remove UC President 
David Gardner from office becau e of his "lack of 

response in addressing the need of the underrepre-
sented students." 

Peltason, Executive Vice Chancellor Chang- Lin 
Tien and Vice Chancellor Horace Mitchell mostly lis-
tened, but did field some questions during the hour-
long meeting. 

The Chancellor assured the Committee that 
recruitment of minority faculty and students 
is "high on our list of priorities." 

The Chancellor left abruptly after meeting for an 
hour with the st udents, saying that he had other meet-
ings to attend. Student dema nds beside the ethnic 
diversity, inclu~ing additional fun~ing for student 
groups, were not discussed at the meeting and many 
students felt the meeting was fruitless .

V CLA Student Government to Vote 
On U CSA Funds After Rep. Resigns 

LOS ANGELES - T he UCLA undergraduate 
government will vote on whether or not to allocate 
SIO,OOO to the University of California Student Asso-
ciation, the UC-wide student lobby. 

Last quarter, the ASUCLA withheld the S5,OOO 
allocated to UCSA each quarter because officers 
decided the UCSA was not addressing UCLA student 
concerns. 

The ASUCLA will decide if the group, which lob-
bies the state legislature and governor on student 
issues. is now representing UCLA student concerns. If 
it determines that the lobby is doing so, the A.S. will 
pay both S5,OOO installments for winter and spring 
quarters. 

UCLA's representative to the UCSA, Bruce 
Cowan, resigned March 14, saying in hi letter of 
resignation, "UCSA may claim that it speaks for all 
students in the UC ystem, but it does not speak for 
me nor for most students. "

A.S.: Elections Raise Policy Questions 
Continued from page I 
dent organizations posting event 
notices, she pointed out. 

There should be some clarifica-
tion in the rules as to what areas 
belong to what colleges, Ramirez 
said. 

"Like the Hump, you don't 
know what college that belongs 
to. Or what about the Price Cen-
ter? What college does that belong 
to?" 

Ramirez felt that a uniform 
posting policy shouid originate 
with the resident deans or the col-
lege councils. 

"The A.S . can't do much about 
it. We don't have the power over 
resident deans and the college 
councils," she said. "Maybe the 
senators could try and work for 
something like this in their col-
leges, but [such a policy] defi-
nitely should involve the resident 
deans. " 

Several resident deans feel that 
a more uniform posting policy 
taking into consideration the dif-
ferent physical make-up of each 
campus is possible. Many resi-
dent deans feel such a policy 
should begin in the college 
councils. 

Fifth College Resident Dean 
Jane Macdonald said that a uni-
fied posting policy for all five 
campuses "would be nice for can-
didates to have." 

"I would be supportive of such 
a policy," she said. "But I think 
the thing that would be difficult is 
that our [college] facilities do 
differ," she said . 

Volando Trevino, resident dean 
at Third College, agrees that a 
new or revised posting policy is in 
order. 

According to Trevino, 1the can-
didates] do violate the polices. A 
lot of illegal posting went on this 
year." 

Resident Dean of Warren Col-
lege Kevin Wood feels that the 
best way to prevent future elec-
tion violations is to revise the cur-

"I think what we should do is 

review the rules, evaluate the loop-
holes , and come up with a secon-
dary policy to fill up the loop- ~

the college councils. As resident

Wood does believe, however, 
that election posting rules and 
general posting rules must differ. 

"The elections require different 
considerations because the can-

He went on to say that even 
though he feels such a united pol-

Remembering the Horror 
Tomorrow is the International Remembrance Da y of the 

Holocaust - Yom Hashoah, the H olocaust Day. It remembers 
the 11 million poeple who died in the camps - Jews, gypsies, 
Slavs, homo exuals, communi t - anyone who was consi-
dered inferior or inconvenient by the Nazi leaders. 

The names of Holocaust victi ms will be read throughout the 
day in Revelle Plaza. This day is not just a day of mourning for 
the dead; it is called " Remembrance Day" because we must 
remember that humans are capable of genocide. In a sense, it 
also remembers tho e who died in the Armenian Holocaust 
commemorated last week , and those who died in the many other 
holocausts of this century - in the Ukraine, Southea t Asia, 
Africa - thi century ha no lack of killing fields . 

It's easy to put these tragedies out of our minds. We don't 
want to think about the horri ble images of the concentration 
camps, nor what we would have done if we had been been in 
Germany during Nazi rule. But we must remember. 

We remember not with hate , but with caution. Governments 
will find genocide convenient again . Iraq recently carried out a 
gassing of a troublesome minority in their country, and Libya is 
preparing its poisonou gas. If we remember that uch evil is 
possible, we will be not so slow to believe and take action . 
America turned away shiploads of Jews escaping Hitler; if we

da y, stop for a moment and listen to a few of the name . The 
names will be read for 12 hours, and it will still be only a

to read all the names o f your famil y member ? 

Changing Communism 
Strange sights are appearing in the communist world; elec-

tion rallies in the Soviet Union, demonstrating students in China 
and the rerecognition of the Solidarity Union in Poland . The 
number one news story of the next decade will undoubtedl y be 
the outcome of the communist world's attempts at openness and 
restructuring. 

It's a tricky situation, Gorbachev - and his critics - are 
almost certainly eyeing the students in China and wondering 
whether a little liberalization inevita bly leads to demands for 
even more freedom . 

Gorbachev has recently demonstrated both his domestic con-
trol by ousting many opponents from the Central Committee 
and hi foreign policy savvy by helping to persuade the Kohl 
government in West Germany to begin pressuri ng the United 
States to reduce or eliminate nuclear forces in Germany. But 
doubts persist about Gorbachev's ability to keep control when 
the Russian people are restless about the sluggish economy, and 
nationalism is surging throughout the Soviet empire. 

There are literally hundreds of books about how to have a 
revolution and throw off the shackles of capitalism. Academics 
have devoted their careers to stud yi ng both peaceful and viole nt 
means of moving toward socialism . But on the subject of how to 
liberalize a communist societ y, how to bring some of the advan-
tages of a market system to socia lism, there is little guidance. 
Gorbachevand Deng are breaking new ground . 

Liberalization may not be possible without completely aban-
doning communist ideals . When China began to bring re~t 
prices up to their market rate , there were screams of protest. ~hls 
was not just because people didn 't want to pay more for housmg, 
but because bureaucratic rules made moving to another apart-
ment extremely difficult . Thus, renters couldn't j ust move to a 
smaller. more affordable place when the rents rose - they were 
trapped in their now-expensive apartments. 

This is just one example. The creation of an effective mixed 
economy is difficult - the United States still hasn't worked out 
the bugs in its own economic system - and trying to do so in the 
midst of dissatisfied consumers, nationalist~ and crit icism from 
both sides concerning the pace of reforms , may prove to be 
politically impossible. The futures of the Soviet Union and 
China and all the commu nist states around the world which 
look to them for guidance and support - are impossible to 
predict. It will be intriguing to watch , and t he next decade will be 
a delicate one fo r the United States'relation hip with the com-
munist world. 

Remembering 
the Holocaust 
Editor: 

ometime we need to think 
about cold , bitter winters to fully 
a ppreciate the warmth and beauty 
of spring. 

Just as it i unpleasant to recall 
pain and fear experienced earlier 
in life, so we avoid thinking about 
horrors and atrocities committed 
earlier in the history of mankind . 

I shiver when I recall the words 
of my eighth grade principal on 
Remem brance Day of the Holo-
caust. He told us of piles of child-
ren's shoes in the concentra tion 
camps and asked that we each 
imagine choosing one shoe and 
think of its owner - what was he 
or she thinking about a the shoe 
was taken off for the last time? 
Did the child go to the gas 
chamber with his or her mother 
or father , or all alone? Did he or 
she know what was a bout to 
happen? Did the child cry? 

It hurts to think about these 
things - about human beings' 
cruelty to each other - but we 
must! This Tue da y, Remem-
brance Day of the Holocaust , 
take a few minutes to remember 
the victims of Nazi hatred. We 
must bear witne s today so that 
we and our children can fully 
appreciate the warmth and beauty 
of spring.

Reverse Racism Unfair 
Editor: 

We are sick of being victims of 
discrimination on this campus . 
Everywhere we turn, there are 
flyers announcing club meetings 
or work hops for virtually every 
culture but our own. 

On our dail y walk to Revelle, 
we see members of an all black 
fratermty, and realize that we 
can't join their organization be-
cause of our race. We pa s T-shirts 
recognizing Hispanic-Chicano 
workshops, Korean and black 
services, the Women's Resource 
Center, bridge programs for'\mder-
represented groups," U ndergradu-
ate-for-a-Day programs for mi -
norities and scholars (which we 
would have loved to attend, but 
our race was, unfortunately, in-
eligible for the program), and 
countless other cu ltural awareness 
programs, 

Then, in the April 13 edition of 
the Guardian, there is an article 
proclaiming that ca mpus organi-
zations want to name buildings in 
the new Price Center after famous 
people in cultures other than our 
own. May we suggest a name? 
Abraham Lincoln. He led a coun-

try full of slaves to freedom and 
the road to ethnic stability. Or 
does the fact that Abraham Lin-
coln is a " white male" automat i-
cally take his name out of the 
running? 

We are members of a culture 
that i discriminated against on 
the UCSD campus. We are white 
males. And in following the good 
intentions of cultural awareness 
policies of the University, we 
believe that the University has 
neglected our culture. 

In this dog-eat-dog world, eve-
ryone needs all the help they can 
get. But we never see anybody wil-
ling to bend over backwards to 
help our "white" culture. We are 
sick and tired of always having to 
fend for ourselves when people of 
other cultures do not have to do 
the same. When is somebody at 
this University going to lend us a 
helping hand? We thought that 
America was an equal opportun-
ity country. Can you tell us when 
we are going to be given an equal 
chance at this University?

Living in Conflict 
.\.. 

Box 

By J ULIE MUNRO 
FealUres Edilor 

At a party tonight , I was introduced as a Guar-
dian editor. I braced myself for the inevitable 
onslaught of criticisms. I expected a particularly 
aggressive reaction because the person who had 
introduced me was Allyson Gold . 

This was not, by any expanse of the imagina-
tion, my first Guardian-related confrontation. It 
wasn't even the first of the evening. Earlier, while 
innocently picking up a friend, I found my elf 
sha ring a living room with an unendorsed A.S. 
election slate. I didn't stay long. 

It never ceases to amaze me that, in these situa-
tions, I sudd enl y become the editor in chief of 
the Guardian. It all started last summer, before 

FEIFFER® 

c1asse even began, with the disgruntled cheer-
leaders. Now the hostility has spread to some of 
my closest friend . 

Tonight, my new acquaintance said he only 
wanted to criticize one part of the paper. Encour-
aged , I spinelessly hoped the object of his attack 
would fall under the reign of another editor. This 
would give me the opportunity to pass the buck 
and slyly switch the subject to skiing, or my child-
ren's literature class, or even politic . 

The object of his assault was, in fact, part of the 
Opinions section , but I was far from being off the 
hook. He thought the 'Editor in a Box'read likea 
homework assignment grudgingly hacked out at 
the last minute. Unfortunately (or fortunately, 
I'm not sure yet) my turn just came up to be 
in-a-box , 

It still annoys me how often people verbally 
and physically attack each other, but I have come 
to the conclusion that we must derive some kind 
of pleasure from a good , messy fight . It must be

with minor variations, stock char-
acters from a long, parallel trad-
tion of Jewish theatre. 

Just as it would be ridiculous to 
state that the outlandish doings of 
the commedia buffoon, Harle-
quin, are derogatory commentary 
about Italians, it is ridiculous to 
believe that the various ways in 
which Chico, Harpo and Grou-
cho cheat and fool other cast 
members are representative of 
Jewish behavior. In both theatres, 
we view the corruption and follies 
of all human beings in general -
one from an Italian point-of-view, 
and the other from the Jewish. 

Editor: 
If the arBument in Gianna 

Oscuro's letter (Guardian, April 
27) is so simple that even a four-
year-old child can understand it, 
then please, someone, run out 
and get me a four-year-old child; I 
can't make heads or tails of it! She 
has grossly misinterpreted what 
she has seen. 

In her letter she states that the 
films of Chaplin and the Marx 
Brothers are offensive and should 
not be shown on campus because 
"they depict persons of evident 
Jewish backgrounds as naive, 
simpk, childish, even stupid." 
While I do not feel qualified to 
comment on the films of Chaplin, 
I believe that her condemnation 
of the Marx Brothers' work is 
invalid for two reasons. 

First, Marx Brothers' movies 
are not specifically depictions of 
Jewish people. In the Italian 
commedia dell'arte, the main roles 
in each play are stock comedic 
characters; the characters por-
trayed by the Marx Brothers are, 

Second, the Marx Brothers, 
while they may be c~i1dish, cer-
tainly do not fit any of the other 
above epithets. The language they 
use (I refer most notably to the 
pun, a sadly dying art form) reflects 
a high level of sophistication and 
intelligence, not simplicity. The 
fact that they always get the better 
of their foil denies an,>' suspicion 
of stupidity or naivete. 

In conclusion, the Marx Bro-
thers' works are about life and 
human frailty, just as all art is . 
They criticize failings that are 
universal to all people, not just 
one segment of the popUlation.

Armenians 
Forgotten 
Editor: 

I am saddened and disgusted 
tonight. I just left the Armenian 
commemoration of the genocide 
of 1.5 million of their people that 
occurred 74 years ago today. It 
was a heinous mass murder and 
torture of a people that lasted well 
into 1918. What I want to know is 
why it is that I didn't hear about 
this until I was almost 21 years 
old? 

When I first got to Mandeville 
tonight, I was truly dismayed by 
the lack of students attending the 
event. So many people on our 
campus talk about becoming 
more culturally aware, yet few 
people made the effort to take this 
opportunity to learn more about 
the Armenian culture. 

Just as appalling is the fact that

Governor Deukmejian was the 
keynote speaker and students were 
still too apathetic to attend. I am 
not concerned with your political 
or ethnic affiliation here, but with 
the common courtesy and natural 
interest in listening to an impor-
tant political figure's viewpoint. 
How sad to know that the stu-
dents of UCSD are just too apa-
thetic to hear the governor of 
their state speak, 

I real1y can't blame the students 
for not being aware of the anni-
versary of the commencement of 
the Armenian genocide since it is 
a relatively unknown event. That 
I blame on our educational sys-
tem. How can we learn from his-
tory and keep from repeating the 
evils of our ancestors if we are 
completely unaware of them? 

How is it possible that the gen-
ocide of 1.5 miJlion Armenians by 
the Turkish-Ottoman Empire 
could be so easily forgotten and 
so quickly followed by the Holo-' 
caust of World War II? If, 74 
years after the Armenian geno-
cide most people are unaware of 
it, in 25 years will we have also 
largely forgotten the genocide of 
the Jewish people by Hitler's 
Germany? Will we allow some-

Mondoy. May 1. 1989 5 

thing similar to occur again? 

There is definitely an integral 
part of our education missing. 
The history books that barely 
touch on the Holocaust com-
pletely overlook the similar at-
tempts to exterminate another 
entire population - the Armen-
ians. I must admit that I have a 
personal interest or else I proba-
bly would not have learned about 
the Anrienian genocide this past 
week either. But it shouldn't be 
like that. 

I know there have been many 
other genocides throughout his-
tory that I know nothing about. 
This is why we are at a university 
- to become more aware of the 
world around us - to become 
not just doctors, lawyers, engi-
neers, philosophers, etc. , but to 

~ecome well-rounded individuals 
that can better the society we live 
in. To do this we must become a 
part of the American melting pot 
and try to assimilate as much 
about other cultures as we can 
while the information is so avail-
able to us. To prevent tragedies 
like these from happening, we 
must remember the past and learn 
from it.

A Defense of 
Chaplin 

Editor: 
I find it hard to believe that 

anyone could object to the Marx 
Brothers or to Charlie Chaplin, 
much less find their work offen-
sive. Personally, I am a great fan 
of all the old comic greats. There-
fore, I was sad to see that one 
Gianna Oscuro wrote to protest 
the showing of their films on 
campus (Guardian, April 27). I 
should like to respond to her, 
well, ridiculous charge that these 
films depict people of Jewish 
backgrounds as stupid and are an 
offense and a slur to Jewish 
people. 

First, I would like to point out 
that these men were comic geni-
uses who gave the gift oflaughter 
(a cliche, I know) to the world and 
continue to do so through the 

films they left behind. Their char-
acters, Chaplin's Little Tramp and 
Groucho, Chico, Harpo, and 
Zeppo of the Marx Brothers, did 
not represent Jews, or Christians, 
or any group specifically. Rather, 
each character represented the 
average man who was often 
uneducated and beset by troubles 
but struggled nevertheless to get 
ahead . 

Often, the character was the 
underdog in society who won 
sympathy from the audience 
because of his perseverance and 
his sincerity in his struggle to 
achieve happiness. Charlie Cha-
plin especially is said to have 
brought tears to the eyes of his 
audience as well as making them 
laugh. For this combination of 
pathos with humor, Chaplin was 
a grand master; I recommend his 
film, The Kid starring Chaplin 
and a very young Jackie Coogan 
(Uncle Fester from the Addam's 
Family) . 

OPINION 

To protest the e films is to deny 
the genius behind them. How 
many of today's comedians will 
still be remembered 40 years from 
now? Charlie (The Little Tramp) 
Chaplin, and Groucho, Chico, 
Harpo, and even Zeppo Marx 
were brilliant artists. They were 
Jewish comedians just like other 
greats such as Jack Benny, Mil-
ton Berle, George Burns, Danny 
Kaye and many others. If Gianno 
Oscuro doesn't appreciate such 
men' achievements, she doesn't 
have to. I just hope she eventually 
realizes that comedic talent may 
often appear foolish but is still to 
be admired like any other ability. 

If Charlie Chaplin and the 
Marx Brothers are an offense and 
a slur to Jewish people then make 
them honorary Russian-Mexican-
American Catholics and they can 
slur and offend me all they want. 
Come on Gianna, lighten up, it's 
comedy!

human nature. 

I suppose these clashes keep 
people from becoming incredibly 
bored: the capitalists versus the 
communists, the co-ops versus 
the administration, pro-choice 
versus pro-life, Greeks versus just 
about everyone else, Brother Jedd 
versus the disco dancers. 

I suppose anyone making deci-
sions which require a bit of 
thought is bound to run into 
opposition. I should be overjoyed 
everyone is so dissatisfied with the 
Guardian. After all, a journalist's 
sure-fire srgn of success is leaving 
both sides of an issue with steam 
coming out of their ears. 

The theory that debate is a 
healthy process of hashing our 
opposing points of view and 
finally coming up with a right and 
wrong answer is admirable. The 

The UCSD Guardian 

problem is, what happens if there 
is no clear-cut black and white , 
just a lot of shades of grey? 

I know it would be impossible 
for the Guardian to leave the 
entire student body satisfied. One 
member of the Che Cafe con-
demned the Guardian for the 
two-page layout devoted to the 
opening of the Price Center, cal-
ling the paper another puppet of 
the administration. 

Some people complain that 
Street Poet Ray is a bunch of 
meaningless babble, while others 
request that it be run more often. 
About 52 public relations repre-
sentatives from in and around 
UCSD want my hide for appar-
ently ignoring their well-planned, 
detailed and earth-shattering press 
releases. 

Well, enough wimpering and 
complaining into my word pro-
cessor that nobody loves me. If I 
plan to pursue this deranged 
occupation after graduation, I had 
better stop making such a stink

DEMONSTRATION: AnimalRights 
Activists Protest UCSD Labs Instant Signs & Banners Continued from plge ] 
regulations that outline the care 
of these animals. 

The regulations are "detailed 
descriptions of research projects 
involving animals, "according Dr. 
Stuart Zola-Morgan, chairperson 
of the Animal Subjects Commit-
tee, and associate professor in res-
idence in UCSD's department of 
psychiatry. 

"These include the housing, 
food and surgical procedures used 
for pain relief," he said. 

According to Zola-Morgan, the 
committee of 17, which includes 
three members who are affiliated 
with animal welfare groups, must 
pass proposed research projects 
by a majority vote. 

He said, "Our goal is to make 
sure a proposed project will give 
the required care and humane 
treatment to animals so the anim-
als will feel the least amount of 
pain and discomfort." 

"Eighty-four percent of the dogs 
we use are used in acute experi-
ments done while the animal is 
anesthetized, and the dog is put to 

sleep following the procedure," 
Zola-Morgan said. 

An acute experiment is one in 
which the animal stands no chance 
of surviving after the procedure, 
he continued. 

"The dog's cardiovas-
cular system is the best 
model we have for the 
human cardiac [system]. 

-Stuart Zola-Morgan 

"The rest of the dogs, are used 
in chronic studies where the 
animal is anesthetized and allowed 
to recover. For example, [in] 
research involving cardiac by-pass 
surgery, we induce a heart attack 
to see the effectiveness of new 
kinds of drug therapy and new 
surgical techniques to repair the 
heart . "

ELECTION: 
Policies 
Questioned 

Continued from P8.f 3 
And what better group to make 
policy in regards to students than 
a student organization?" 

"It is important to hear what 
[resident deans] have to say," 
Ramirez continued. "I think it is 
important that the resident deans 
are listened to, but I think they 
should only give advice, 

'" think that if the resident 
deans wish to have input then 
they are obligated to know the 
regulations and rules as well, So if 
a student asks them they will 
know," Ramirez said. 

Coming up with a uniform 
plan between the five colleges, 
according to Muir College Elec-
tion Commissioner and past Muir 
College Council Chairperson Russ 
Heilig, is unlikely, However, there 
could be a coded supplement 
added to the election bylaws, he 
suggested, 

"This. could be done by stu-
dents alone. They could formu-
late a good college-by-college set 
of rules. I don't see any problems 
getting that done. I can see them 
willing to do something like that . 
Two senators could do that early 
in the year." 

Heilig feels the posting rules 
"should be consistent throughout 
the year," and summed up the 
view of many people that it is time 
the posting policy is revised . 

"It's been years since anybody 
took a good look at [the posting 
policy,]" he said. 

Tim Purpura, resident dean at 
Revelle, speaking about a new or 
revised posting policy, said, "I 
think it would be a matter of get-
ting all the college councils to-
gether" to formulate a new policy 

"a~ long as there is a provision so 
that the resident life staff deter-
mines their own areas. 

"I'm a great supporter of the 
college system," Purpura said, 
"but this is one place where it 
breaks down.

Academic Tenure Procedure 
Based on Subjectivity 

By REBEKAH DENN 
Staff Writer 

The tenure review system is 
built with checks and balances, to 
ensure that no one is unfairly 
treated; but it ultimately depends 
on how individual faculty inter-
pret the evidence. 

This Is the second of a two-put 
examination of acallemlc tenure. Part 
one appeared on April 27. 

In the teaching review, for 
example, student reports, such as 
CAPE reviews, are a major part 
of the evidence . It is difficult, 
however, to gauge their accuracy 
- or how seriously the individ~1 
faculty members on the commit-
tee take them. They might only 
measure good showmanship, said 
some professors, or an easy 
grader. Opinions ran the com-
plete gamut from "a completely 
invalid means of evaluation" to 
"absolutely the best way availa-
ble." These reviews are the only 
input most students have in the 
process, but they mayor may not 
be seen asan accurate opinion, or 
even an accurate reflection of stu-
dent opinion. 

"We are as accurate as we can 
be," said CAPE co-director Garret 
Beauvais, "and hopefully we are 
transferring students' informa-
tion to the faculty .. .1 believe we 
are taken seri9u Iy." 

If teaching ability is found lack-
ing in a review, several professors 
said, they would refer the candi-
date to the two-year-old campus 
Faculty Development Program 
(FDP) for improvement. 

Such references , said FDP 
Chairperson John Andrews , are 
actually few - more often, his 
clientele has come on their own. 
He would like to build a closer 
connection to the departments 
for his program, which uses 
methods such as videotaping 
classes and in-depth student feed-
back to improve teaching ability. 

"Something more than student 
evaluations is needed," former 
Muir Provost John Stewart said. 
He feels the most valuable source 
of evaluation comes from "a per-
son's colleagues, in terms of what 
the students who come to them 
have learned from Professor X's 
class." It is difficult to quantify, Ite 
said , but eventually a pattern will 
come through. He always re-
quested that such an account be 
included in the candidate's file, he 
said, and recommended that pro-
fessors visit each other's classes 
"and see what is really going on ." 

Most professors feel research is 
more easily judged , but a break is 
seen between the sciences and 
humanities. In the non-science 
fields , the research reviews are, by 
nature, more often subjective. 

Candidates may make sugges-
tions a s to who they would prefer 
for some of their six reviewers 
and comment on their file if they 
feel there is anyone in their field 
who might judge them unfairly. 
One ·review might be unjust , but 
one professor queried, "a)) six?" 

Problems might also arise, Com-
mittee on Academic Personnel 
(CAP) chairperson Herbert Stern 
said, "(if there are] petty differen-
ces within departments ... has the 
department provided adequate 

and correct information to the 
CAP committee?" If a vote is 
divided into side strongly for and 
against a candidate, he said, "it's 
usally not a purely academic dif-
ference ." It is CAP's place to 
know something about the depart-
ment, he believes, and be sensitive 
to such discrepancies. 

"That won't work," said one 
professor, "It is not any faculty 
member's place to know about 
the inner workings. of another 
department. " 

Grievances on such a level can, 
of course, be submitted to the 
Committee on Privilege and 
Tenure. 

There is some concern that the 
review process is too formulaic, 
especially with its focus on pub-
lished research. "The tenure deci-
sion has to be based upon the 
record ," math professor Alfred 
Manaster said. To be evaluated 
by one's peers, a common argu-
ment goes, there must be some-
thing tangible to evaluate. 

However, "this publishing sys-
tem in certain fields is bad," litera-
ture professor Charles Chamber-
lain said , "because it's hurrying 
people to publish things, some-
times before the discipline is 
ready." 

The University has a world-
wide reputation for excellence, 
and naturally wants to maintain it 
by hiring only the best scholars. 

"1I's so big (though,] that, in 
effect, it's a Procrustean Univer-
sity," Chamberlain said . (Pro-
crustes was a mythological robber 
who ambushed travellers and put 
them in his bed. If they were too 

"Only a few people 
actually fit ... but 
they're made to fit ... 
and they're maimed in

long, they were chopped down . If 
too short, they were stretched 
out.) "Only a few people actually 
fit the bed, but they're made to fit 
it or they're out. . . and they're 
maimed in the process," Cham-
berlain said. 

"I personally feel a lot of stuff 
gets published that shouldn't 
be," anthropology professor Jim 
Moore said. "The way the system 
is set up, it's probably better to 
write a hundred lousy papers than 
five good ones." 

More mentioned a program 
some universities are adopting, 
where the professors may submit 
only five of their papers for use in 
the tenure review. Their remain-
ing research is not a factor in the 
decision. "You'd have to do good 
work, not just churn out some 
stuff," Moore said . 

There is a need to publish, said 
Computer Science and Engineer-
ing (CSE) Chairperson William 
Burkhard, to show demonstrably 
steady progress. 

There is concern that the pres-
sure to publish discourages junior 
faculty from attempting more 
experimental research, which may 
not be published or quickly ac-
cepted. 

Burkhard believes that recent 
appointees in his department are 
steering further away from tradi-
tional research. He "absolutely 
expects" them to be tenured , he 
said , but none have come up for 
review ,Yet. "We'l ee what will 
happen four or five years from 
now." • 

In a recent review by the 
anthropology department , a case 
involving controversial research 
was examined. 

K~/GuardiQ" 
"The way the system is set up, it's probably better to write a hundred 
lousy papers than five good ones," Jim Moore said. 

In the departmental decision, 
Professor Stanley Walens was not 
recommended for promotion to a 
tenured l'osition. The decision, 
was largely based on Walens' 
scholarship, said R.G. D'Andrade, 
former anthropology department 
chair. Although his CAPE reviews 
have been consistently above the 
90 percent mark and his service 
was acceptable, the "large mono-
graph that he produced during 
the period oftime he was here had 
enough criticism, and enough of 
the department didn't think well 
of it, that it was decided not to 
(recommend him)."

Feminist Panel Discusses 
Reproductive Rights 

By SUSAN HYLEN 
Staff Writer 

After the Supreme Court had heard its first 
day of the now-famous Webster v. Reproduc-
tive Health Services, UCSD students and 
faculty gathered for a panel discussion entitled 
.. At Risk: Reproductive Autonomy." 

Mark Salo, executive director of Planned 
Parenthood, gave background information 
about the Court's historical 1973 Roe v. Wade 
ruling, expressing concern that "there is a 
good chance this decision could be seriously 
eroded. " 

Salo said the issues raised by Roe v. Wade 
speak to the sovereignty of one's body. "The 
idea that a person should have sovereignty ... is 
profoundly simple, yet is radical because 
many believe you shouldn't have that right." 

Dr. Sheila Tobias, a professor in the politi-
cal science department, echoed Salo's concern. 
She said the decision poses "a complex set of 
ethical choices, but the political issue is one of 
compulsion. If we lose Roe v. Wade, women 
will be compelled to be mothers." 

Tobias chronicled the shifting opinions on 
the abortion question, noting that people have 
always argued over the issue, but that it was 
only in 1973 that women became players in 
the debate . Previously, those with the right to 
decide the fetus's fate were the husbands, doc-
tors, or the state, according to Tobias. 

"What we achieved in Roe v. Wade ... was 
that for the first time in this country the right 
was given to women to control their own 
bodies," Tobias said . 

With the focus on political concerns and 
the possibility of the Supreme Court overturn: 
ing or altering Roe v. Wade, issues of the 
morality of abortion were not discussed. The 
panel was notably one-sided, with no repres-
entation of a pro-life perspective. 

During an audience discussion and question 
period , Student Advocate Bard-Alan Finlan 
voiced the lone pro-life opinion of the even-
ing. Finlan was disturbed because the focus 

(I to r) Julie Ulrich, Mark Salo, and Sheila 
Tobias listen to a question from the audience. 

was "not concern for the fetus, but for trying 
to control women." 

Salo responded that an individual could be 
pr<Khoice and personallyanti-abortion. Salo 
questioned whether the state has the right to 
impose a largely religious value on everyone. 

Kathryn Hendersen, a graduate student and 
one of the panel's organizers, said the organ-
izers saw the event as an opportunity to pres-
ent their views and discuss the political issues 
without the presence of pro-life propaganda. 
The panel was sponsored by the UCSD Fem-
inist Theory Study Group. 

The panel also included three graduate stu-
dents who participated in the April 9 
"March on Washington for Women's Equality 
and Women's Lives." Christina Accomando 
explained the lobbying the participants had 
done, and urged the audience to contact their 
own representatives on abortion issues. 

Included in the discussion were a slide show 
and a video by undergraduate students Kelli 
Willis and Suzanne Hartman, who were also 
at the April 9 march in Washington, D .C .. 

Lisa Cauble of the UCSD Women's 
Resource Center outlined what she described 
as an "environment conducive to sexism, 
racism, and classism" at UCSD. She urged 
the audience to "say something, do something; 
don't be complacent," in order to combat this 
conservative atmosphere. 

The UCSD Guardian FEATURES 

Tenure Process Examined here because they recognize they're getting access to people on the 
cutting edge of research. And that 
means these people have made a 
kind of commitment, somewhat 
different from the kind of com-
mitment a person would make if 
teaching undergraduates was 
going to be the primary focus of 
that person's career."

whose views you are criticizing. I 
suppose you have to wait to do 
innovative research until you've 
got the tenure." 

"Most of the reviewers are inno-
vative people too," D' Andrade 
said, adding that, "We like inno-
vation." Remember, he said, that 
in Walens' two and four year 
reviews the same complaints were 
made: not enough produced and 
lack of scholarship. D' Andrade 
feels Walens did not accept the 
criticisms. 

Numerous students expressed 
dismay that because he was not 
granted tenure, Walens must 
leave. ~He's really changed peo-
ple's lives," senior anthropology 
major Jennifer Lake said. "I can't 
say that about too many others in 
that department." 

Many scholars say the system is 
what they expected, and only 
requires of them what they already 
wish to do. 

"Anybody who's bright enough 
to be a professor is bright enough 
to be doing something that's a lot 
more lucrative," said William 
Propp, a UCSD history profes-
sor. "I enjoy teaching . . .1 think 
I'm a good teacher, but I came 
here primarily to do research," he 
said. 

"There's always the pressure 
that the University wants you to 
publish," said CSE professor Joe 
Pasquale, who was recently 
awarded a Presidential Young 
Investigator award. "But I 
wouldn't be at a top flight univer-
sity if a lot of that pressure wasn't 
internall), generated ... We should 

not be driven by the fact that 
someone is looking at how many 
publications we have, but by doing 
good research and wanting to tell 
people about it." 

Does the importance of research 
- both to the University and the 
individual faculty members -
detract from the quality of teach-
ing? Beyond the minimum accep-
table level, it seems the quality of 
instruction is left up to the 
instructors. 

There is an overall level of 
excellence in teaching here, Ste-
wart feels , "and increasing sup-
port in the administration and 
CAP ... I simply feel that we do 
not yet give (it] enough import-
ance. " 

"This is the University of Cali-
fornia," math professor Alfred 
Manaster said, "Students come 

"Within hours of my being 
offered the job here," Moore said 
of his promotion from lecturer 
to "tenure track" assistant profes-
sor, "a friend of mine on the 
faculty pointed out that I shouldn't 
sit here with my door open aU the 
time and talk with students, 
because when I'm doing that, I'm 
not pUblishing. 1 would like to 
publish more . . .I've got the ideas, 
I've got the data ... but 111 have to 
come to terms with restricting 
office hours. I hope it won't affect 
my teaching."

"The habits built during the six 
untenured years," countered 
another professor, "are not that 
easy to break. The 'publish or per-
ish' philosophy is still relevant 
through years of promotions and 
merit reviews. There needs to be 
more emphasis placed on the impor-
tance of good teaching, even in 
the first few years. " 

It is difficult to define what 
"good teaching" is. "There's no 
exam to measure teaching abil-
ity," Moore said. There is a com-
mon perception, for example, that 
good research and good teaching 
go hand in hand, that the superb 
research required will naturally 
produce a superior teacher.

ment on current events. " 
The excitement a nd en th usiasm 

that comes from doing good 
research, many instructors believe, 
will carryover into the classroom. 
"Oon't forget ," Stewart added , "a 
very fine researcher will have a 
powerful effect on the intellectual 
quality of the department. He 
could be very stimulating to other 
colleagues, which would [indirect-
ly) reach the students. Or, some-
times a professor will be very 
good with graduate courses, even 
if not with the undergraduates." 

"There are clearly some excel-
lent teachers [at UCSO), regard-
less of the emphasis the University 
places on it," said John Smart, of 
Hyperlearning, a tutorial service. 
The large introductory classes, he 
feels , may hamper the quality of 
the education. 

'" expect a lot from my stu-
dents," Pasquale said, "so there's 
pressure on me to do a good job. 
If they see me working hard, 
they'l want to work hard also.:' 
Teaching and preparing for his 
class, he said, requires 20-30 hours 
per week. 

"There's no question that there 
is extreme pressure on the non-
tenured people, extreme pressure 
. .. so much so that it becomes 
very difficult for them to meet 
their obligations with regard to 
both research and teaching," 
Stewart said. "When acting as 
provost, I tried t9 avoid ap-
pointingjunior faculty to commit-
tee positions, so as to prevent 
further taxing their time." 

Teaching and research are both 
time consuming. When asked how 
.much time the combination re-
quires, responses ranged from 50 
to 100 hours per week, with most 
around 70. "Every waking hour" 
was a coulmon reply. 

Many professors had little 
teaching experience before their 
university appointments, and they 
found teaching especially time 
consuming during their first few 
years. 

"Remember that graduate 
schools don't teach you to be a 
teacher, they teach you to be a 
researcher," Stewart said . The 
T.A. experience that most receive 
in graduate school "isn't really a 
teaching role. It comes close , you 
can learn a lot, but ... college 
teaching is the only profession 
you can enter that I know of 
without any prior experience or 
adequate display of your com-
petence." 

"Previous experience in grad-
uate school, oreven some lectures 
on the philosophy of teaching 
from my professors might have 
helped. My only prior experience 
- though it was unusually scant 
- was as T.A. for one class," 
Propp said. 

"Teaching is not necessarily a 
natura] talent ... but an art that 
people can learn and develop," 
FOP Chair Andrews said. 

The tenure decision has become 
more significant in recent years. 
At this point in time, in a system 
such as UCSD's, which has a 
potential space for each appoin-
tee, receiving tenure is not just a 
matter of remaining at UCSO, 
but sometimes a matter of re-
maining a university scholar at 
all. Many universities expanded 
greatly in the 19505, and faculty 
positions were not as difficult to 
find. Denial of a tenured position, 
biology professor Herbert Stern 
said, was not seen in a negative 
light. The decision process is more 
formal and restricted today. and 
having to leave an institution like 
U SO is seen as a black mark on 
one's record . 

" uppose you don't make the 
cut after six year ', " hamberlain 
aid . "If you've got a hou e, 

family, debts ... suddenly you're 
back at the bottom of the heap." 
See APPOINTMENT , pale 13 

The UCSD Guardian 

Tenure Appointments 
Continued from pale 12 

To ensure a well-rounded depart-
ment, candidates with different 
specialties than the current faculty 
are usually sought: If they do not 
receive tenure, the University is 
left with no expert in their field , 
and often no easy way of finding 
one. 

In Walens' case, for example , 
"we will not have somebody 
working with American Indians, 
which leaves us with a real hole . .. 
or anybody that heavily into art, 
which will leave us with another 
hole .. , these are not easy to fill 
either," O'Andrade said. 

Personally, as well as profes-
sionally, departments want their 
original appointments to work 
out. To live with someone six or 
seven years, then deny him or her 
tenure, "is an awful thing to do, 
personally," D'Andrade said . "It's 
so painful that most departments 
will do anything not to have to do 
that ... absolutely anything ... It's 
why they try so hard to get good 
appointments from the start." 

The importance of achieving 
tenure varies amongjunior facuIty 
members. "Day to day? Here in 
Southern California I worry more 
about earthquakes," Propp said . 

"One can't worry about getting 
tenure for the whole six years 
prior to the decision ... You'd end 
up going crazy," Moore said . "I 
have to have faith that the work 
I'm doing is good , and that my 
training is good , and that I'm a 
salable item. I don't, at this point, 
see any reason why I won't get 
tenured here as long as I publish 
.,. [but) I don't want to live my 
life according to a formula of 
publications per year." 

When the decisions come up, 
Stern said, "even the best in our I 
department are nervous and con-
cerned." 

" Maybe I'm not typical," one 
literature professor said, "but I 
never worried very much about it. 
.. . I wanted to be the best teacher 
and scholar that J could. If I was 
good, then, barring some injustice, 
I felt tenure would follow."

Not everyone is cut out to change 
the world. After all, it takes educa-
tion, skills and a spare two years. 
Also a willingness to work. Hard. 
This year 3,750 Americans will join 
the Peace Corps to do just that. 
They'll do things like build roads, 
plant forests and crops, teach 
English, develop small businesses, 
train community health workers, 
or even coach basketball. However; 
what they'll be doing isn't half as 
important as the fact that they'll be 
changing a little piece of the world 
... for the better. 
And when they returl), these 
3,750 Americans will find that 
experience doing hard work will 
have another benefit. It's exactly 
what their next employers are 
looking for. 
So, give the Peace Corps your next 
two years. And while you're out 
changing the world, you'll also be 
making a place in it for yourself.

Men's Volleyball Beats La Verne in Four as Season Comes to an End 

UCSD Wins Pac. Coast V-Ball Championships 
By BRIAN ITOW 
Contributing Sports Editor 

The upstart Tritons took their 
show on the road and captured 
the Pacific Coast Volleyball Con-
ference crown this weekend at La 
Verne. 

UCS D quickly di patched an 
outmanned Chapman squad, 15-
6, 15-7, 15-9. "We blew through 
them," UC D Coach Digger 
Graybill aid. "They played hard 
but we just had too much fire-
power for them." 

That firepower came from all 
angJe - the middle, outside left 
and out ide right - as setter John 
Childer distributed the ball to all 
part of the court and set the tone 
for the Triton attack. 

The victory moved UCSD into 
the final against a fired up La 
Verne team which had advanced 
to the finals with a victory over 
UC Santa Cruz. The Leopard, 
who had fallen apart in a four 
game match against UCSD a 
week earlier, were not about to let 
it happen again. 

The Tritons built a 12-8 lead in 
game one but the Leopard fought 
back with the hitting of AIl-
Conference players Donnie Flora 
and Pat Paschal to win the first 
game 15-13. 

The potent La Verne attack 
caught Graybill's attention. "They 
came out and played very well ," 

he said. "They had us a little wor-
ried, but we had confidence that 
they couldn't hang with us." 

And they couldn't. Once the 
Tritons got their offense in gear, 
they began to dominate. They 
quickly evened the match with a 
15-8 victory. 

In the pivotal third game, the 
Tritons played solid volleyball 
and got strong defensive effort 
from middle blockers John Davey 
and Steve La Bonge. UCSD cap-
tured the game and the advantage 
with a 15-11 win. 

"The third game took the wind 
out of their ails," Graybill aid. 
"Once we gained that advantage, 
La Verne knew it was going to be 
a real uphill battle." 

The Leopards could not even 
get one foot up that hill as the 
Tritons dominated the fourth 
game and rolled to victory and 
the champion hip 15-6. 

While the Triton played an-
other trong game up the middle, 
they concentrated their attack on 
the outside. Jeff Babcock paced 
the Tritons with 25 kills. Nate 
Brown added 21. Two other play-
ers finished in double figures -
Nick Rothman had 16and Davey 
had 17. 

With help from the Tritons' 
defense on the net, the backcourt 
defense shined again. It was led 
by Brown, who recorded 14 digs 
and Rothman who followed with 
13. 

"This was a match we had to go

out and win," Graybill aid. "[La 
Verne] didn't self-destruct as they 
have a tendency to. " 

The win gave UCSD its first 
ever conference title . In the 
inaugural tourney last year, the 
Tritons advanced to the finals 
before falling to UC Irvine. 

The win also capped a success-
ful second-half for the Triton 
squad. At one point in the season, 
UCSD was 5-14 and struggling 
against more talented Division I 
squads. 

However, they battled back late 
in the season to finish 12-16 and 
ranked 20th in the nation in Men's 
Open Division. They were the top 
non-Division I squad in men's 
volleyball. 

The Triton improvement began 
as they developed more consis-
tency in mid-season. When they 
started to play Division II and III 
squads a short time later, their 
stability really started to show; 
the Tritons won seven of their 
final nine games and went unde-
feated en route to their first con-
ference title. 

Graybill felt the schedule was 
tough on his team "but it's the 
nature of the animal. We'd like to 
have a more competitive schedule 
early on, but we're not complain-
ing. We playa good schedule and 
people know we are a top team to 
be taken seriously." 

The conference announced its 
awards at a tournament banquet. 
Graybill was named "Coach of

the Year," and three Tritons were 
named to the seven-man all-con-
ference team. Babcock and John 
Lim earned all-conference honors 
while Brown wa named Most 

Valuable Player. The rest of the 
all-conference team included 
Flora and Paschal of La Verne. 
Mike Minier of Chapman, and 
Ken Mitchell of UC Santa Cruz. 

Softball Blanks Whittier 
Unstoppable Tritons Now No.2 in Nation 

By DAVID POnCHA 
Staff Writer 

The Tritons showed just how 
dominant they were this weekend 
as they swept a pair from Division 
I Loyola Marymount, and - to 
prove it was no fluke - took 
another two from Division III 
Whittier College. 

Fresh from their weep of Loy-
ola on Friday, the Tritons, con-
tinuing the same impressive play 
that has earned them a number 
two ranking in Division III , 
blanked the Whittier Poets on 
Saturday, 10-0 and 7-0. The games 
were not even close, and the Trit-
ons improved to an impressive 
32-7 record . 

UCSD's Kathy Fogg (9-2) 
pitched the first game against 
Whittier. Still, she was not overly 
impressed with her outing and 
pointed out that if her pitches had 
been a little better she would have 
"alJowed less hits." 

First-year pitcher Dianna 
Moreno pitched and won the 
second game, improving her 
record to 11 -3. She too went all 
the way, but only had to pitch six 

innings, because the IO-run rule 
was invoked. 

In the second game, Whittier 
errors helped the Tritons chalk up 
the victory. Tammy Deitrich, 
Whittier's starting pitcher, said 
that the "loss was frustrating 
because we don't usually commit 
errors. n The Poets committed five 
in the game, all of which led to 
Triton runs. Deitrich left the game 
behind 5-0, but had not surren-
dered an earned run. 

Moreno felt her pitching "went 
pretty well," but admitted she had 
a "couple of problems out there." 
She accredited the win to good 
defense, which helped her "out of 
trouble. tt 

"[The players] like to create 
situations and often times create a 
lot of their own breaks, tt Coach 
Lisa Bassi said. "There was a lot 
of intensity out there and the 

team was executing really welJ. tt 
"I'm very pleased with the team," 
Coach Lin Adams said. [The 
players] are doing everything 
asked of them. Everyone was hit-
ting well. .. the defense was play-
ing strong." 

Bassi and Adams singled out 
the pitching staff as a primary 
asset to this year's squad, but also 
recognized the contribution of 
team co -captain and catcher Tra-
cey Kehr. "She is phenomenal," 
Adams said, "because she has to 
know each and every pitcher and 
what they throw. "Dianna Moreno 
added that lKehr] is a leader. 
When my pitches aren't working, 
she finds a way to get me back on 
track . ., 

The Tritons host USD in a 
doubleheader on Wednesday -
their last contest before Regional 
play begins.
