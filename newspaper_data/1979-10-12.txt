1979. 

Forcible-entry burglaries increased 33 percent, from 53 to 70, and auto theft 
went up 94 percent, from 18 to 35. 

More violent crimes. however. remained virtually non-existent on campus. 

There h" ,; been only one reported rape in the last nine months, that over the 
summer, and no homicides . There has been one suicide. last month. 

There ha ve been 11 assaults since January, the same as last year. and 45 claims 
of unlawful entry, a category for which none of last year's statistics are available. 

There have also been two arson allempts thi ' year, the same as last year.

Graphic hy Charl~5 O' ·ulli,·an The increase at UCSD follows universitv statistics compiled this week which 

indicate that crime is up at five of the UC campuses (Davis, Irvine, UCLA , Santa 
Barbara and here) and down at the rest. Carter Greeting is Quiet However, total arrests are down for the whol system, not the case here. 

Campus police spokesman gt. Clark Martin claims the UCSD increase mirrors 
an increase for San Diego as a whole, and that the campus is trying to fight back . From the Associated Press 

"We've added a half-time crime prevention officer who's been working with the 
Women's Center, is aeveloping a bike theft profile and is working to try and teach 
people how to not have their bikes stolen." 

President Carter was given a reserved reception as he returned to the Navy Base 
where he was stationed as an officer during the Korean War. 

During his three hours in San Diego, Carter allemted a Coronado reception and 
addressed the 60th annual convention of the AFL-CIO Building and Trades 
Department. Martin also says the department has requested money for more men, but adds, "We·~.e requested more peopl in the budget year after year, and haven't go lien 

them. In the speech just five days after the Federal Reserve Board initiated credit-tightening moves that are expected to sharply curtail construction activity, Carter 
drew applause at the convention when he declared: " I guarantee you I will not fight Martin says campus organizations are partly to blame for the crime increase. 

"(The Women 's Center) is the only group that's asked us to help with crime 
prevention, with the Rape Prevention Task Force. And we try to talk to people in 
the dorms whenever the H.A. ·s and R.A .'s invite us, but that doe'sn't happen very 
often for whatever reason."

In the only incident of the day, three members of the Jewish Defense League 

were detained after trying to enter a "restricted area," the Secret Service said. A 
JDL spokesman claimed fiv members were arrested, but that was later denied by 
the Secret Service. 

The typical campus criminal has a profile, statistic' show. He's male (89 
percent), not a student at the university (87 percent) and over 18 (87 percen,t) . 

According to the JDL spokesman. Randy Medoff, the members were sent to 
disrupt Carter's speech to the labor group by yelling "Dump Carter, not Israel." 

At Coronado, a predominantly Navy city of 23.000. Carter was introduced by 
US Rep. Lionel Van Deerlin. D-Chula Vista as "a quiet but courageous fighter ." 

One crime statistic remained virtually unchanged . 
Campus police handed out 3,016 parking tick~ts last year, 3.101 this year. And 

/arking ~rvices has given out 22.692 so far, a slight increase from the 22,405 it 
handed out last year. 

Carter recalled his Navy days at San Diego, saying his most vivid memory was 
of getting up at 3:45 am "every morning to catch a ride down to the pier" so he 
could make connections to reach the USS Pomfrat, a submarine he served aboard. 

Mattin says tha t the figures never change because parking is always used at 
capacity, with about the same number of violators year to year. There is "certainly 
nn parking ticket conspiracy," he says . 

During his six-month stay, Carter said he and his wife learned to speak Spani~h. 
"We had a good life here," he said, referring to his wife and sons Jack and Chip.

WOOlen Will be Subject of Study 
On Retention, Campus Services 

By Kathy Huffe r 
A ssocia te Ne w. Editor 

More than 500 UCSD women will be 
surveyed in two weeks on their needs at the 
school and the high percentage of their sex who 
transfer or drop1out before four years. 

Part of a year-long study of UCSD women, 
the survey will be mailed to a random selection 
of female students who will be asked to respond 
to questions regarding various aspects of 
campus life, according to Beryl Brown, 
chairwomen of the Committee for the 
Assessment of Women Students' Needs. 

The seven-member committee. composed of 
campus stalf, faculty and students, will use the 
auryey as a guide in their study, Brown says. 

The .urvey will supplement statistical studies 
on UCSD women by examining explanations 
and .. why· ... of UCSD's female attrition rate, 
according to Brown. Utilization of campus 
services, sex role confict. and influences on 
academic majors will be majo~ focuses of the 
survey, .he says. 

Fil(urea from In.t spring indicate that over 52 
percenlol.tudent leaving UCSD are women.

sCiences students and an overcrowded job 
market, will indicate more dissa tisfaction at 
UCSD than women majoring in the natural 
sciences. 

While she is unable to further predict the 
results of the survey. Brown notes that "the 60 
percent we lost didn't feel so good" about 
UCSD. 

The survey stems from last year's formation 
of the committee, requested by Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs Richard Armitage to explore 
the reasons for female a ttri tion at UCSD, 
according to Brown. 

To provide an incentive for the ~e!ected 
women to respond to the survey. participants

says. 

About 50 of the respondenb will then Iw

hypothesis," derived from the surve>:, Brown 
says. This "follow-up" will be made winter and

Cultural Unity Day Reported Poorly 
Editor: . 

On Oct. 8, there was an 
article pubbshed by your 
newlpaper written by John 
HondrOi. HondrOi wrote on 
the Cultural Unity Day of 
Awareness and made specific 
reference to keynote speakers, 
along with the urging of 
minority student activism at 
the university. This article, in 
general, brought concern to 
me as the chairperson of the 
CUDA committee because of 
the manner in which Hondros 
covered, wrote and repre· 
sented this very significant and 
historic occasion. 

First, I was very concerned, 
(angered) by the fact that the 

A.ian American Students 
Alliance speaker, Philip Vera 
Cruz, did not receive equal 
coverage by the reporter in 
que.tion. which was not the 
case of the other keynote 
speakers at the festival. This to 
me was nothing more than a 
lack of understanding and 
sensitivity of the philosophy 
behind the CUDA committee 
and the celebration. It also 
goes to show The ()aily 
Guardian's continued 
distorted view of what is 
factual reporting. I make 
reference to the articles written 
about CUDA on Oct. 4. where 
CUDA was used as a 
scapegoat by the newspaper 

only out of common courtesy 
to the organizations involved 
in CUDA; (B) that any article 
written about Third World 
student organizations be 
approved first by chairpersons _ 
prior to publication; and (C) 
that reporters are advised to 
take a Third College 
composition course or similar 
writing course in order to assist 
their writing techniques and 
secure more appropriate and 
factual reporting. 

I~~~~~~~~~~~I because the committee was granted $600 for six booths. 

As a final note. I would like 
to close this letter by stating 
that CUDA lays on a very 
strong foundation and 
philosophy: solidarity , unity 
and power over common 
rights that we as Third World 
people have. Which means 
that if anyone of us is 
ne!{leded or thou!{ht of less 
important, we will take offense 
to this plus voice our concerns 
in Clny manner deemed 
appropriate.

Palestinian Lobby 
Fervent, Impotent 

By Wanda J. MacClarin 
One year ago, a group of 

prominent Palestinians met 
in a solemn conclave at a 
secret location in San 
Francisco. The Camp David 
accords between Egypt and 
Israel had just been signed 
and these militant supporters 
of the Palestinian Liberation 

Though they are as 
dedicated to the fight for 
their homeland as many 
American Jews are to Israel , 
America's Palestinians are 
poorly organized and even 
uncertain about their rights 
to express anti · /srael 
opinions in Ihe US , Wanda 
1. MacClarin, a freelance 
writer who interviewed 
many Palestinians as parI of 
her preparation for a 
masler's degree iR journa· 
lism from UC, wrote this 
story for the Pacific News 
St!rvice. 
Organization were planning 
a strategy to demOnstrate to 
the US their unanimous 
rejection of the treaty. 

They would send a jointly 
signed telegram to President 
Carter announcing their 
opposition. 

The telegram was never 
sent. • After hours of debate 
over the risks and benefits. it 
was decided it was too 
dangerous for Palestinians 
living in the country that is 
Israel's closest ally. 

These aame Palestinian 
leaders, who represent IIOrne 
8,000 Palestinians living in 
San Francisco (the second 
largest enclave in the U.S. 
next to Detro,it), are 
nonetheless openly commit· 
ted to Yasser Arafat and to 
the PlO as their legitimate 
representatives . 

The militancy of their 
politics toward larael and the 
uller timidity of their actual 
political action in the United 
States is one of the more 
intriguing characterillics of 
the large and growing 
community of Paleatinianl in 
America. ' 

But no one .hould br 

deceived into thinking that 
Palestinian rhetoric about 
Israel is only skin·deep. or 
that it does not represent the 
vait majority of ordinary 
Pa estinians in this country. 
After interviews with scores 
of Palestinians in the tightly· 
knit San Francisco 
community, I failed to find a 
single Palestinian who did 
not support Arafat as the true 
representative of the 
Palestinian people, and who 
did not demonstrate that' 
support with generous cash 
contributions. 

The degree of commit· 
ment to Arafat found among 
Palestinians here must call 
into question one of the 
principal assumptions 
underlying U.S . policy 
toward the Israeli· Palestinian 
dispute: the existence of 
"moderate" Palestinians. 

If only these moderates 
would come forth , say Israeli 
and U.S. policymakers , 
negotiators could arrive at a 
just solution . They say 
moderates are the true 
representatives of the 
Palestinian people. 

But the reason they do not 
come forth , according to 
virtually every Palestinian 
here, is that they do not exist; 
they .are either a figment of 
Israel's imagination or a 
myth constructed to 
influence Western opinion . 

San Francisco's Palestini· 
ans say they silently 
supported the PLO when 
they lived on the West Bank, 
but they were afraid' for 
themselves and their families 
to sa y so publicly. It is only in 
the freer political climate of 
the United States that they 
feel secure enough to declare 
their allegiance. 

In San Francisco, a clear 
majority of Palestinians 
freely and openly supports 
AI·Fatah. the lar!(l'stpolitical 
faction within the PlO. AI·

Francisco's Palestinians are 
almost unanimous in their 
approval of guerrilla attacks 
on Israeli military targets. 
One former guerrilla now in 
San Francisco says he 
sHacked an oil refinery, 
Israeli army personnel and 
vehides during hia raids into 
Israel, but the attacks were 
never reported in the press. 

Even those who don't 
support attacks on civilians 
believe Americans are 
biased in their condemnation 
of such attacks. Ibrahim

condemned violence, but I 
want the same standards 
applied to the Israeli "

Palestinian terrorists." 

When Palestinians kill 
women and children, says 
Tawasha, they are called 
terrorists, but when the 
Israelis bomb refugee camps,

7,000 Bees Plunge 
to Their Death from 
AP & M Building 

A massive heehive was knocked down by the Grounds 
department yesterday from outside the fifth floor of the 
Applied Physics a nd Mathematics Building. killing more than 
7,OOt) honeybees. 

" It 's not that anybody has it out lor bees," explained 
Environmental Health and Safety Officer AI Ray. "But too 
many people are susceptihle to anaphylactic (allergic) 
reactions to let the hive stay up any lon!{er." 

Once a swarm of hees has heen reported, it is normal 
procedure to ca ll Ii beekeeper and have the beehive removed 
without harming its occupants, said Pest Control Supervisor 
Stll-ve Pyle. But the three heekeepers who were called refused 
to come ge t the bees because the hive was "too high up. a nd 
inaccessible," said Pyle. 

"Custodians were scared of being stung, especially at 
night, when hundreds of bees were gelling confused, a nd 
hanging from light!> on the 5th floor 01 AP&M," Pyle 

-commented . 
Sue Pettijohn , a secretary in the physics department, said 

that parts 01 the huge honeycomb had fallen , and dead hees 
had been dropping into the windows for weeks. 

Several people have expressed anger over the drastic 
measures that had to be taken. "The beehive has been here a ll 
summer," said one person who works in AP&M . " If someone 
had done something ea rlier, then they wouldn ' t have had to 
massacre all those bees. " 

Pyle, who used to be a beekeeper hlrnself, said that he had 
noticed the hive hanging there, hut didn't do anything about it 
until things had gollen out 01 hand. and he issued the order to 
spray the hive with diaLinon, it ~hemical pesticide. 

While Pyle is forced to destroy "about a dozen" hives a 
year. he is able to SHve 25 to :m. He would just as soon

r 'imetable for AFSCME 
Takeover Uncertain 

A!though the American Fedenition of State, 
County and Municipa l Employees has taken its 
first steD toward becoming a bargaining altent 
for UC blue collar employees, the union still has 
it ways to go, says Les Chisolm, AF!;CME's 
California area assistant director. 

AFSCMJ:: Wednesday became the first 
union to file a petition to the Public Employee 
Rela tions Board call in ~ for a UC bargaining 
representative election . The petition was signed 
by 30 percent-the reQuired support needed to 
be submitted to PERd - of the unionized 
service workers employed systemwide. 

The next step, according to Chisholm, 
requires the University of California's appraisal 
of AFSCME as an "appropriate" bargaining 
representative. 

.. How soon the election is held is determined 
by how quic kly the union receives approval 
from the university :' says Chisholm. Because 
the petition was filed only two days ago, he says 
it is too soon to determine the election date. 

"When voting, all eligible union employees 
will have a minimum of two choices from which 
to choose: either AFSCME or no 
representative, which would mean no collec.:tive 
bargaining," Chisholm says. ~ However,1 don't 
think that's a viable alternative because the 
present support for AFSCME indicates the 
majority are for collective bargaining." 

In order- to be recognized as a bargaining 
agent, AFSCME will need a 51 percent vote in 
the systemwide election. 

As of yet. no other union has received as 
~uch support as AFSCME, he says. "I believe 
the blue collar unit will want us (AFSCME) 
because we are the most experienced and 
professional representative they can gel." 

AFSCME, the only AFL·CIO unit in the UC 
system, claims to be the nation's largest public 
employee unit. . 

Chisholm emphasized that Thursday's 
petition was AFSCME's Jirst move toward 
representinl{ all UC bargaining units. He says 
AFSCME has already received "significant 

support" from derical, technical, health care 
and skilled cra ft a reas , 

"We plCln to file petitions to represent these 
other areas within the next year," ~ li<lyS.

Beat Pt. Lorna 4-0 

Soccer TeaDl Evens Record 'with 4-0' Win 
By J. Rigby Slight 

Wednesday the members of 
the UCSD sm:cer team put on 
their kicking shoes and booted 
a hapless PI. Lorna squad 4·(). 

This victory moved the 

Trito/l's league record to I - I 
and their overall record for the 
year to 5·5~ 

According to coach Stewart 
H ayes, " The Tritons 
com ple tely dominated the 

game," and the statistics seem 
to bear out this assertion. 
UCSD clicked off 37 shots on 
goal to PI. Lorna's 19, and PI. 
Lorna's goalie was forced into 
15 saves, while the Triton's 

goalie Pat Robinson only 
needed to save 3 shots . . 

1M Refs Improved by Training 

Stopper Peter Matz rang up 
the Triton's first score on a 
penalty kick, as the result of a 
rather violent shove by PI. 
Lorna's goalie. 

Simon Stracker scored the 
second goal, and Bill Bullock 
booted in the last pair . By Tim Liotta 

In the past they've ra nked 
as one of the least p'opular 
groups on ca mpus. People 
have insulted them. People 
have second guessed them. 
Some have even tried to hit 
one or two of them. But this 
year things have changed . 
Intramural referees are fina lly 
gaining some respect from the 
1M football players. 

"You can never do a good 
enough job," says sports 
assistant Steve Crowder . 
"Somebody won't be-
satisfied. " 

Handling two tea.ms of . 
enthusiastic football players 
isn't an easy task . It takes 
more than just knowing the 
rules a nd the 1M department 

has a rranged a pair of clinics in 
order to prepare for the 
upcoming season. , 

The fir s t clinic is a 
classroom. like exercise where 
1M coordinator Scott Berndes 
and some sports assistants 
lec ture the referees on fi eld 
positioning and interpretations 
of the rules , along with ta lks on 
a ttitude and confidence. 

But refereeing takes more 
than just memorizing the 
rulebook. Realizing this, the 
1M department inaugurated a 
second clinic this year which 
enables referees to fee l the 
pressures of game situations. 
They are able to officiate a few 
practice plays in order to get 
the feel of the job. 

Experience plays such an

If you or your spouse are employed 
through UCSD you're eligible to take 

important role in the forming 
of a good referee that no 
referee can get enough of il. 
This second clinic seems to 
have been responsible for the 
fine performances turned in 
by the 1M referees'. Players 
and onlookers have been into 
the 1M office this week with 
compliments on the first 
week's job. 
- The 1M depa rtment isn't 
satisfied with Ont: week's worth 
of good reviews . To keep the 
referees improving,the 1M 
department will have the 
sports assistants watching the 
games and judging the 
official's t:Ompetence. If they 
see any problems they can 
point them out to the referee

Bruce Logan played a 
particularly strong game for 
the Tritons. He was credited 
with three assists, including a 
long throw in to Bill Bullock 
for the fourth score, and a 
brilliant corner kick. 

With the score at 2·0 Logan 
caught the PI. Loma goalie 
playing too far up, and lofted 
the ball over the goalie's head, 
and into the back of the goal. -
The ball was stopped by a 
defender who was however 
forced to use his hands. This 
resulted in Bill Bullock's first 
score on another penalty kick. 

The Triton's midfielder Art 
Lopez should also he noted for 
his fine first time performance . 

This win came on the wake 
of another victory last

EaY.. Part 01 Schedule Over 
Top Water Polo Opponents Due 

By Jon Goetz 
Sports Editor 

Tonight the water polo team 
starts its second season when it 
faces UC Santa Barbara at 
7:30 in the natatorium. 

The Tritons rolled to a 7·2 
record over the small schools 
in the past three weeks. 
winning a tournament. and 
throwing their wei""t around 
against the Claremont 
schools, and the small private 
universities. 

Tonight they start playing 
the big boys. After Santa 
Barbara. 'whom coach Russ 
Hafferkamp calls a likely 
NCAA champion this year, 
UCLA, Cal State Fullerton. 
Arizona, and Long Beach 
State will pay the Tritons a 
visit. 

But for tonight, Santa 
Barbara. Hafferkamp figures 
coach Pete Snyder will only 
bring his second string players 
down for the game. and leave 
hi. starters at home. Yet even 
the second best UCSB players 
could overwhelm the Tritons 
under the right circumstances. 

Still, UCSD has several 
advantages that could 
frustrate the Gauchos of Santa 
Barbara. The game tonight 
will be played in the 25 yard 

~I here, shallow at one end. 
UCSB may have troubles 
adjusting their strategy to this 
pool from the wide.open 30 
meter pools they usually play 
and practice in. 

" If we were going to play 
these guys at 30 meters, we'd 

get blOwn out of the pool, " 
says Hafferlulmp. "I think 
they'll have problems in this 
pool," he predicted. 

The crowds that have been 
attending the night games at 
home may add as many as two 
goals to the score tonight. 
"The players really get 
pumped - they want to do 
well for the people who show 
up," says thl' head coach. He 
has seen hi!> team rally when 
the noise in the enclosed 
facility became thunderous in 
night games against Arizona 
last ~ear and Grossmont last 

month. 
Workouts this week have 

been showing signs of a more 
mentally aware team. "It's 
been an exceptional week for 
practice,". said Hafferkamp. 
"We're gelting our heads into 
it. The light bulbs are popping 
on. 

"I ha ve no qualms about the 
offense. We've been ironing 
out problems in the offense this 
week," said Hafferkamp. 
"The thing thai's going to be 
really importanl is keeping 
their score down." 

Pirates Win in Rain 
BALTIMORE (AP) -

Pinchhitter Manny Sanguillen 
delivered a two·out, two· strike 
single during a hard rain in the 
·ninth inning, scoring Ed Ott 
with the winning run last night 
as the Pittsburgh Pirates 
nipped the Baltimore Orioles 
3·2 in the second game of the 
1979 World Series. 

The victory tied the best·of· 
seven series 1·1, with the two 
teams moving to Pittsburgh 
for the next three contests, 
beginning tonight. 

Sanguillen, the seldome· 
used third·string Pittsburgh 
catcher, once a top hitter, won 
a bailie of nerves with 
Baltimore reliever Don 
Stanhouse and drilled the 
decisive hit on another rainy, 
bone.chilling night in 
Baltimore. 

. Pinch·hitter Bal Robinron 
opened the ninth' with a single 
to left against reliever Tippy 
Martinez. Baltimore Manager 
Earl Weaver immediately 
went to his bullpen for 
Stanhouse, a right.handet who 
save 21 games this season. 

The frizzy·haired pitcher 
made just one pitch to Bill 
Madlock when pinch.runner 
Mati Alexander took oil for 
second. The speedster 
previously had been thrown 
oul only once all year , but 
Orioles catcher Rick Dempsey 
gunned him down. 

After Madlock flied out, Ott 
bounced a bad· hop single off 
the chest of Baltimore second 
baseman Billy Smith. Then, 
Phil Garner, goat of the 
Pirates' 5·4 opening·game 
defeat, worked out a walk on 
four pitches.

Stars Reunite Here 
By Jon Goetz 

A couple of national team water polo players will be gelling 
logether again lomorrow night to play , nol Cuba or 
Yu.goslavia, but UCSD. 

Russ Hafferkamp, normally coach of the Triton team, will 
abandon Ihe team for the nighl to play with the "College All . 
Stars ," a make·shift coalition of Hallerkamp's buddies in the 
waler polo world. 

Hafferkamp and Joe Vargas , who plays at UCLA no~ , both 
played on the US team which toured Europe and the.Can.bbean 
in competition this summer. Some other .UmverSity of 
California graduates, Jon Fearn of UCSB, Bnan and Barry 
Smith of UCR, and possibly Scoll Hinman of UCSD (now an 
assistant coach on the team), will also play. 

The purpose of the game was 10 give the UCSD team an 
opportunity to gain some extra experience, but the players may 
take it as a chance to get revenge on Hafferkamp for those 
grueling hours swimming laps and treading water. 

Hafferkamp will be setting the two meter spot, and he won't 
give his opponents any breaks. " If they ~ive :ne an in~h , I' ll 
take it. But every time the ball comes '" , I m sure 111 get 
hammered:"

a newer referee improves, he'll 
be able to handle the tougher 

. games. Scott Berndes spends 
hours scheduling each week, 
Irying to fit the proper refs with 
Ihe proper games while 

working around Iheir 
academic schedules. No 
mailer how well il comes off, 
somebody is always unhappy . 

Due to budge I cuts this 
year two referees will be 
assigned to each game. except 
for the AAA games which will 
get Ihree. Each referee will 
have a specific job. When two 
refs are assigned Ihere will be a 
linesman and an umpire. The 
umpire will be responsible for 
the downfidd play while the 
lillt!sman covers offsides and

Live In a Donn, 
It's Good for You 

By William Hamilton 
An essential educational 

aspect of the collegiate 
experience is residence in 
on-campus dormitory 
facilities. Immersion in 
campus lifestyle and 
concomitant exposure to 
bizarre and depraved 
student behavior provides 
fo.r the acquisition of 
perceptive techniques for 
deciphering the perverse 
actions of one's peers, 
facilitating greater insight 
into the nature of the 
twisted student mentality. I 
know this to be true because 
it sounds plausible and 
furthermore looks rather 
impressive in print. 

with administrative staff 
members, due to the 
likelihood that the severe 
damage you will inflict upon 

You meet your new roommate. 
Many an entering student 

will shun donnitories, an 
action predicated on fears 
that prospective roommates 
will not accept the specific 
peculiarities (e.g .. -
thumbsucking, sleeping 
with a floodlight on, 
transvestite tendencies) to 
which his parents have long. 
since become acclimated. 
Such reticence is essentially 
unfounded, as many 
students discover that their 
roommates . exhibit aberra-
tional symptoms of deeply. 
manifellted psychological 
disorders which haven't yet 
been categorized by clinical 
therapis,ts.

tion eliminates potential 
quibbing with bureaucrats 
over the waterbed, 22 cubic 
foot refrigerator, or cocaine 
laboratory you have set up 
in your room, and good 
rapport has practical 
advantages if you are a 
habitual troublemaker who 
enjoys being known on a 
first-name basis by the local 
police, or an excessively 
unkempt housekeeper to 
the point that your

your presence and attempt

Did you ever feel like you 

were living inside of a comic 
book? 

On September 29, 1979, I 
spent one full day observing 
the various twisted shapes, 
forms and colors of a small 
group of borderline humanity . 
There was a constant stream 
of bizarre women dressed in 
taltered hose and ancient, 
foreign jewel ry. There were 

acne·covered boys with "light 
sabres" and dueling armor, 
plastic swords and inler. 
gallactic medals. There were 
even two peculiarities whose 
gender was unknown to me, as 
they were dressed in outer 
space suits. 

nol one of "Ihem," (and not 
many of us a re,) then stay 
away because you won't 
understand them. They talk, 
dress, look, act 'and think 
different from all of the tamer 
forms of mankind . These are 
the obsessed! These are the 
dreamers! And at any time, 
lurking under those drifting, 
fantasizing minds, a hostile 
and extroverted personality Please !urn to paRe 12 

These people are loosely 
referred to as science fiction 
buffs, and they are dangerous 
when provoked . If you do not

Sci-Fi FilDls Shown Free 
By Meg Honda 

Dr. Jekyll 'and Mr; Hyde 
and White Zombie will kick 
off a free series of horror and 
science fiction films to be 
presented beginning October 
17. Also scheduled are The 
Thing (October 21,) Orpheus 
and Alphaville (October 29,) 
and THX 1138 (November 
7,) all shown at 7 pm in the 
Mandeville Auditorium. 

Although the films are being 
shown in conjunction with 
Professor David Clayton's 
Literature 152 class, all 
UCSD students and faculty 
are encouraged to allend . All 
but Alphaville are original , 
uncut, 35mm versions , 
enabling audiences "to see 
them in the manner in which 
they were originally intended 
to be viewed. " Clayton says 
that "each film will be 
preceded by a brief 
intr,oductory talk in which I will 

discuss the significance of the 
work to be shown and will be 
followed by a ques tion and 
answer session which will 
allow the participants to 
express their own reactions to 
the program ." 

Clayton says that he got the 
idea of showing films last 
spring when he taught the 
course. However, it was not 
until this quarter that he had 
access to these "films of 
fa ntasy and science fi ction." 
Bob Epstein of the UCLA Film 
Archives is given credit for his 
assistance in tracking down 
the original films. Clayton 
expressed his desire to run 35 
mm prints rather than the 
more readily accessable 16 
mm copies . "The 16 mm 
copies were made for 
television and the quality is not 
as good as in the original 

. " versIons. 
Dr. Jehyl/ and Mr . Hyde 

and Whit~ lom!>ie are 
"fantastic films of the early 
thirties in which the scientist is 
depicted as being endowed 
with quasi.supernatural 
powers ." James Arness is 1n/! 
JhinR, an outer space bein~ 
who crashes into the Arctic 
Orpheus, a French film, is 
based on the Greek legend of 
the same name , in which a 
man who visits his deceased 
lover in the underworld is 
forced to remain there. Alpha· 
ville, another French film was 
shot almost entirely at night 
with high· speed stock, l'HX 
1138, directed by George 
Lucas, "uses the fr<lmework of 
the traditional science fiction 
film as a vehicle for 
speculation about the future of 
a more serious kind. " 

The films are sponsored by 
the Department of Literature, 
Univ e rsity Events, and

'Man, Woman, and Bank' Has Right Combo 
By Beth Hul 

Great acting, sharp hm1lor 
and an old plot with a new twist 
make for good entertainment 
in A Man, A Woman and A 
Bank. Donald Sutherland as 
the con man Reele comes up 
with the not.too.original idea 
of robbing a bank. His 
counterpart Don (Paul 
Mazu.ky) adds flavor to the 
film al an unwilling, hesitant 
and hypochondria«; part~r in 
crime. Brooke Adams, a 
relatively new actress whose 
previoul experience includes 
only a small role in The 
Invasion of the Body 
Snatchers, is a sort of 
modernly traditional as a 

freelance photographer and 
Reese's girlfriend, Stacey. 

Sutherland, a veteran actor 
and formerly Tra!rur John in 
the film Mit-A J(. S H and also 
of The Invasion of the Body 
Snatchers, delivers his bright 
one·liners and sharp witticisms 
with remarkable flair . The 
audience comes away 
believing that he could 
successfully perform as a 
stand·up comedian in his spare 
time. 

'Mazursky, the computer 
engineer who devises the 
details of their scheme is 
convincing with his constant 
complaints of a heart attack, 
the flu , or an ulcer.

Though the idea- of bank 
robbery won 't win any awards 
for originality , the computer· 
ized system designed by 
Mazursky for stealing the 
money was both brilliant and 
feasible. CUlling wires and 
changing circuits before the 
bank building was completed 
allowed Mazursky to create 
his now remote control 
security system. With 
Mazursky's programming 
used to unlock and open 
certain doors , vaults and 
safes, Sutherland easily 
slipped into the main safe, 
bagged the money in an 
inconspicuous duffel bag a nd 
left just as simply as he 

entered . Reali stica lly very 
plausible! 

Noel Black, a new director, 
has luckily ha d much success 
with his ' fir s t major 
undertaking, A Man , A 
Woman, and A Banh. This 
film hones tly reflects the many 
talents a nd outstanding 
instinct that Black possesses 
when it comes to dealing with 
peQPle in the film industry. 

'Ihe one drawback of this 
hilarious comedy is the film 
editing done by Carl Kress.

Bare Wires 
Our Song 

By Ted Burke 
The ' sun was h()tte~ than t' xpt'ded and WilS softening the 

papercup wax In Hoh shand: Glohs of Iwo·tolle wax, o:ang-e 
and. red , collected under hIS fingernails as he slumped, nearly 
supine, on the otherwIse empty bench, facing a slage. He took 
a gulp from. the cup and thoughtlhe beer, barely fifteen minutes 

~rom the SpIgot, tasted like water someone had soaked old nails 
In. . 

On stage, a~,all woman"rock band was stomping a Bea tie:; 
song to death. ~et . B~c k. He never liked the song, although 
he pret~nded to like It fIve years ago when his girl friend, Suze, 
gave him the record .for Christmas. The guitarist spread her 
legs as she look a solo, with the instrument tightly wedged on 
her crotch as her finders scurried over the Irp' ; and the 

ex~resslon on her face varied between th ersatz eroticism of the 
tYPIcal Penthouse model and the lock·jawed macho of many 
prelly boy rock stars. Fake·out to the max, thought Bob. He 
crumpl~d up the c~p and rubbed the wax on his shirtless ches t, 
where It gathered In sticky smears. 

Two dozen sailors, lillie kids, punks whose hair resembled a 
prun~d palm tree, and a smattering of old lolks no doubt 
co~vlnced that Western Civilization had ebbed to the lowest 
POint! crowded around the stage. The sailors put their fists in 
the. air: The pun.ks st~od s.lump shouldered, trying to simulate 
exhnchon. 1 he little kIds threw snow cones at each other wh 'l t~ old folks ~overed their ears. The guitarist linished her soll~ 
wl.'h a hIgh kIck .. touch d~wn style, and lead singer took the 

ml~rophone a~al~. Her vOIce was h~avy with bad whisky, bad 
breath, and OIcohne scars. The vOIce was a loud wheeze too 
ma~y people thought sounded bluesy , like Janis or Big Mama 
She repeated the first verse . 

"JoJo was a man - who ihought he was a woman -but he 
was another man ... " . 

Bob's eyes ached. He shut them and raised his head to th; 
sun. 

. "You really like this?" Suze 's eyes were green like cheap 
,ade and as WIde as the outside ring of a solar system diagram 
Bob looked at her t~n .turned his gaze to the record player: 
The record was ~plnmng too slowly lor his tastes. Paul 
McCartney, soun~lng as though he had a head cold, was half. 
way through the first verse. . . 

Suze was lying on her bed. Her blouse, crinkled like crepe 
paper and annoying to Bob's fingertips, was half·unbuttoned .

A couple of ~ ago, Star-
Con '77, a Science FICtion and 
F antaIy Film Convention here 
in s.n Dieto, waa a huce 
lIIacceu. Over 3000 people 
attended, spent money in the

were fortY-lOme dealers with 
an aSlOrted , sampling of 
bubble gum cards, movie 
po.ters, rare comic hooks. 
video tapel, film still., ::md 
original artwork. This i. where 
I apent the day, behind my 
dealer's table, where I · was 
able to observe this fascinating 
parade of grotesques, 
8fUelomeI llt'KI goblins. 

Of courae, no fantasy 
,;onven~on would be complete 

ithout a film room, and the 
Aar·Con had two. John Field, . 
.1m coordinator, kept his 

l'lftJjectorl running for more 
than 24 houri and served up a 
more.than.adequate banquet 
of Ieatures, lhorts, television 
aboWi and cartoons. Aside 
frtlm the typical Star Trek 
epi.ooea, the films included 
some rare Superman shows, 
"The Day The Earth Stood 
SliD," Mel Brooks' Young 

Frankenstein, Journey To The 
Center Of The. Earth, 
Chaplin's The Great Dictator 
and many wonderful cartoons 
with Tom and Jerry , Woody 
Woodpecker, Bugs Bunny, 
Daffy Duck and others. Also 
shown was the infamous 

. Merrie Melodies cartoon that 
was banned from television, a 
black version of Snow White 
named "Coal Black And The 
Sebben Dwarfs" hilarious 
from start to finish. 

The rest of the' convention 
wasn't nearly as well run as the 
film rooms, though . The many 
earlybirds were liTled up and 
crowded in a dozen different 
places, unsure of where to go. 
The dealers were madly 
scrambling for carts to haul 
their wares in and out , and an 
air of pandemonium reigned 
for hours . . ..".1Int ~r change waa one of Ienath. The convention 

would be only one day as 
QDDOIeCI to the IuB weekend of 
Ij77. Then the location waa 
chanIred. The U.S. Grant 
Holef downtown would be the 
new lite, and beca~ 01 lack 
oIlpIICe, the convedion would 
be limited to . t 1,500 
participants. uniortunately, 
barey 800 showed up. 

Dorm Life Unforgettable 

Ei(. •• t hundred people is not 
alat of people for a convention. 
A convention is a high-
intensity, high.energy, 
OI'Ianized gathering of many 
people with similar interests. It 
takes a lOt o"~g, a lot 01 
spending and a lot 01 love . One 
thilll you need is people, 
pushing hoards 01 people, and 
that's one thing Star-Con '79 
lacked. 'Ihey simply did not 
abow up. 

The activities were typical. 
If you've ever been to a ~omic 
book convention, you knew 
exactly what to expect. 1bere

John Lennon took a guitar solo, which inspired Bob to tum 
toward the mirror, shake his hair until dandruff flew from it, and 
made hand gestures as though he were p1ayinll lIuitar. 

"You guys are all alike" she said, "always into that. I'm 
sorry I bought you the record. " Suze never like the Beatles. She . 
thought the Stones were better. Bob felt the same way. To him, 
the Beatles were pansies, while the Stones were real men. But 
he couldn't tell Suze that. He .never talked about 'music to lIirls. 
For a reason he never understood , none of his friends talked to 
their girl friends about how totally hot a guitar player was, how 
dyno a drummer played, how a keyboard player completely 
ripped . Women weren't interested , he thought. All they want 
'rom rock and roll is poetry, messages, something spiritual 
and untouched by human hands. Bob and his friends drank 
beer. Their girlfriends drank wine. Suze never talked about 
music with Bob because Bob never knew what he was talking 
about. She had taken ten years worth of piano lessons, and five 
years of lIuitar lessons after that. 

The turntable snapped off with a dick of the groans of well, 
worn metal. 

" Let's hit it." he said. 
" Hit what?" She asked, not listening. She was playing with 

the ends of her hair while trying to remember something. Bob 
pulled a comb through his hair. 

"The sack" he said, pulling off his pants, "when are your 
parents coming back tomorrow?" Suze grinned, suddenly 
remembering. It was something she wanted to say. To Bob. 

The band finished playing and were busy signing autographs 
for the sailors , punks and little kids while the roadies stripped 
the stage of amplifiers, instruments and microphones. In the 
wings , a team of dressed,alike tuba players waited to come on . 
Bob was wet with warm beer, inside and out, and pushed his 
way through the sailors and punks. He came face to lace with 
the guitar player, who was smiling. 

" You guys are totally fucked," he said. The guitar players' 
smile faded like the dot in the center of a TV set. "You slalls are 
totally fucked for playing that ,song. Got no right, you tatal 
creeps ... " The guitar player backed off. A stoned punk with 
acne resembling cigarette burns over his face stepped between 
them and jabbed Bob in the shoulder. "Why don't you be quiet, 
man, or .. . " Bob knocked the hand off and pushed the punk into 
a sailor who had arms out of a Charles Atlas ad. "Watch 
yourslef, pal, don't start somethin' you can' I. .. " Bob turned 
yourself, pal, don't start somethin' you can'L." Hob turned 
away and started shouting at the band, which was jumping into 
the side door of a van parked to the side of the stage . He shook 
his fists. He looked around and found himself sandwiched be, 
tween the punk and the sailor, who grabbed him by the shoulder 
and started to say something. Bob knocked his arm off with a 
sweeping motion.of the arm. the punk hit him in the back of the 
head with something hard, probably an unopened beer can. 
Bob's head collapsed. He fell to his knees and caught the 
sailor' s bent knee runninll thing!! now. They sweep too much 
stuff under the rug.

The purpose of eve'y Wang pmduct is the same: 
to enhance productIvity . . 

At Wang Laboratories, we make computer and word processing systems. 
But we're really not in the computer OJ word proceSSing business. 

Our business is productivity. And that's a people business. 

Because it's people who produce. Machines just ,make it easier. 
Maybe all this sounds obvious. But you'd be surprised how many com-
puter and word proceSSing manufacturers forget that the end users of 
their products are people. 

At Wang, we never forget. 

That's why our products are simpler to use than theirs. And more 
efficient. -

And that's why we're growing faster than anybody else in the business.' 

-And that's why we're interested in Bachelor's, Master's or PhD 
car.dldates.

COORS asks ~ qUestion: 

What if the great men and 
women of history hadn't had 
those important sounding names 
so suited to their eventual 

. achievements? Would they have 
failed to accomplish all that fate 
had in store for them? 

Or Hockstein's Heights? 
The 1859 gold rushers would not 
have charged halfway across a 

continent shouting "Hockstein's 
Heights or bust!" 

Just look at the names that fill 
our early history. William 
Tecumseh Sherman. Ulysses S. 
Grant. George Rogers Clark. 
Meriwether Lewis. J.E.B. Stqart. 
Susan B. Anthony. Lucretia 
Mott. Nobody fools around with 
people like that. 

And with a name like Adolph 
Coors, what else are you going to 
do but figu~ out how to brew a 
great beer in a better place than 
anybody ever brewed beer before. 

• Did any of those city brewers 
ever climb a mile up in the Rockies 
just to get pure mountain 
MIIW"~ spring water, or ~w their own 

For instance: 
Zebulon Montgomery Pike. 

"Pike's Peak!' But what if his name 
had been somethipg elserWhat 

would the Colorado 
high country 

have done witli 
~ury's Mountain? 

high country barley? Of course 
not. That's why Coors is special-
the only beer that lets you taste 
the high country. The beer that 
makes all the others just city beer. 
Coors. It's a great name.
