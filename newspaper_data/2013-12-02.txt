Students will vote on a referendum 
next quarter that will potentially raise 
student fees to help resolve the trans-
portation crisis. A.S. Council approved 
the language for the $52-per-quarter 
fee increase referendum at their meet-
ing Wednesday night, only a few days 
after the Graduate Student Association 
approved the same bill.

A.S. President Andy Buselt told 
council at its weekly meeting on 
Wednesday evening that students 
would be able to vote on the referen-
dum in a special election to be held 
during Week 8 of Winter Quarter 2014, 
which is Feb. 24 to Feb. 28, 2014.

The vote to approve the referen-
dum to go to students passed 20-0-
3; Physical Sciences Senator Sierra 

Donaldson, Marshall Senator Kathleen 
Maguire and Muir Senator Matt Pavon 
abstained.

At a Nov. 13 A.S. Council meet-
ing, Revelle Senator Soren Nelson said 
the results of the Transportation Task 
Force survey showed student support 
for a referendum.

“More than 60 percent [of respon-
dents] marked either “support” or 
“strongly support” [for] a fee refer-
endum, and so that was sort of our 
go-ahead to continue with the refer-
endum,” Nelson said. “We’re confident 
that we have a lot of support behind the 
referendum.”

The UCSD Police Department is 
continuing its search for a suspect 
after a student was cut in the neck 
near Center Hall on Monday night.

Subscribers to UCSD Emergency 
Status alerts received a notification 
Monday night warning affiliates not 
to engage anyone involved. According 
to Police Department notifications, 
the student was cut in the neck at 7:16 
p.m. on Monday at the intersection of 
Gilman Drive and Meyers Drive.

“UCSD police is looking for a 
stabbing suspect,” the alert read. “Do 
not contact the suspect, call 911.”

A police report sent to all stu-
dents and staff said that the suspect 
“approached the victim from behind 
and possibly used a sharp object to 
cut the victim’s neck.”

Thirty minutes later, the victim 
reported the incident to UCSD police.

The report described the stabbing 
suspect as a 50-year-old white male 
of medium build with long, dark 
hair and a bushy, white beard, wear-
ing a “green sweater over gray and 
white camouflage shirt and pants” 
and carrying a tan backpack. He was 
described as a transient who left the 
area headed in an unknown direc-

STARBUCKS TO REPLACE 
ESPRESSO ROMA

An 11-4-0 University Centers Advisory Board vote gives the green light for 
UCSD to start negotiations to bring the coffee giant to campus.

A Starbucks Coffee cafe will replace Espresso Roma Cafe in Price Center, pending a contract nego-tiation after an 11–4–0 vote Tuesday by the 
University Centers Advisory Board. 
     After beating out Java City eco-Grounds in the vote, 
University Centers began drafting a business plan with 
the popular coffee chain.

UCAB Chair Sammy Chang was not allowed to 
participate in the vote but said that the addition of 
Starbucks would bring added revenue to University 
Centers including Price and the Old Student Center.

“I would venture to guess that with the current 

UCEN budget crisis, Starbucks produces much more 
revenue for University Centers, and that may be one of 
the driving forces [behind the vote],” Chang said. 

The popular coffee chain will donate $5,000 in 
scholarship funding annually, according to Chang.

Some students have expressed concerns over the 
corporate chain’s addition to Price Center due to 
reports of unethical practices that violate the mission 
of UCSD’s Fair Trade Advisory Committee as spon-
sored by former Chancellor Marye Anne Fox in 2009 
and enacted in spring of 2010. The committee agree-

Price Center East and West 
were evacuated Tuesday afternoon 
after trash can fires in two sepa-
rate bathrooms set off smoke alarms 
throughout the building at roughly 
2:30 p.m.

A source heard from a mainte-
nance worker the smoke that filled 
the building was coming from two 
fires in bathrooms on both the first 
and second floors of Price Center. 

Police officers later determined 
that the smoke came from two trash 
cans that had been set on fire in the 
bathrooms in Price Center East.

According to the source, evacu-

ees were initially allowed back into 
Price Center, but when another 
smoke alarm went off, they were 
told that it was not a drill and were 
instructed to evacuate again. 

Fire trucks were seen headed 
toward campus shortly after 2:30 
p.m. 

The source reported that evacu-
ees would be escorted back into 
Price Center to retrieve their 
belongings but would be required to 
exit the building once again.

According to workers at Tapioca 
Express, Price Center was reopened 
around 3:45 p.m.

Two dozen engineering students 
from UCSD and San Diego State 
University will be hired to walk 
through the San Diego streets begin-
ning mid-December to take note of 
places that need restoration or replace-
ment in accordance with the San 
Diego City Council’s sidewalk assess-
ment plan.

The city of San Diego has about 
5,000 miles of sidewalk, much of 
which is cracked, worn out and in 
need of repair. A few roads lack any 
sidewalk whatsoever. According to the 
plan, these cases present a danger to 
pedestrians.

 California state law holds home 
and business owners responsible for 
fixing the sidewalks outside of their 
own properties, but there is little incen-
tive for them to do so. Furthermore, 
San Diego is legally accountable for 
falls caused by deteriorated sidewalks, 
although lawsuits against the city are 

often difficult to win and offer rela-
tively low payouts, according to attor-
ney Darren Pirozzi. 

“The end result is that we have 
crumbling sidewalks that are trip 
hazards and liabilities for the city, 
and yet we apparently have no actual 
responsibility for replacing them,” City 
Council President Todd Gloria said in 
the Voice of San Diego. 

Many interest groups pressured the 
city council to take action.

In response, city council voted on 
June 10 to allocate $1 million into 
next year’s budget for a comprehensive 
sidewalk study. In its report, the coun-
cil planned to hire local engineering 
students, along with two junior engi-
neers, to travel along the sidewalks 
with GPS equipment. They would 
track areas that are broken or missing 
and also determine causes of the dam-
ages and estimated costs of repairs. 

Unfortunately, the city was unable 
to hire students fast enough, which 
caused a six-month delay in the plan. 

“It’s the hiring process. It takes 
some time,” transportation official 

Hasan Yousef said to the Voice of San 
Diego.

Once the background checks are 
complete and recruitment is finalized 
in mid-December, the students will 
cover about a mile per day. They will 
start in San Diego’s older neighbor-
hoods where sidewalk damage is the 
most severe, according to city spokes-
man Bill Harris. 

“Those are the areas where we 
think we’re going to have the great-
est areas of repair and maintenance 
needs,” Harris said to the Voice of San 
Diego.

The study is expected to take a year 
to complete, finishing in early 2015. 
During this time, the city council 
promised to bring up current sidewalk 
policies for investigation and debate. 

“Ultimately, we want to revamp 
the policy in such a fashion that it 
works,” Chair of the Committee on 
Infrastructure Councilman Mark 
Kersey said.

ment ensures all businesses that sell 
coffee, tea and sugar to be fair trade-
approved. On March 3, the committee 
voted to expand the university’s policy 
to include products verified by third 
parties such as C.A.F.E. Practices. 
According to Krista Mays, chair of 
the Fair Trade Advisory Committee, 
both Starbucks and Java City meet the 
current UCSD fair trade policy. 

A.S. Council Social Sciences 
Senator Colin King, who also sits on 
UCAB, was one of the four dissent-
ing votes.

“We believe that equal verifica-
tions should be an unbiased third 
party, and C.A.F.E. Practices is fund-
ed by Starbucks,” King said. “The 
one thing UCAB administrators 
said to counter that argument is that 
[C.A.F.E. Practices] teams up with 
Conservational International which 
is technically the third party verifier. 

“Their board of directors is com-
posed of an ex-CEO of Starbucks ... 
and people that sustainability advo-
cates on this campus don’t believe 
should be associated with the univer-
sity, so we don’t think we should be 
associated with Starbucks.”

Although Java City meets the 
overall fair trade criteria to satisfy 
UCSD’s agreement, only a portion 

of the coffee they sell has the proper 
certification.

“Unfortunately, the UCSD policy 
only allows [fair trade] verified and 
certified which means Rainforest 
Alliance [certification] is not yet a 
part of that policy nor is organic,” 
Chang said. “[All] Java City coffee 
cannot be used or sold at UCSD, 
which means Java City is not that 
profitable and that may be another 
reason [for the vote].”

On Nov. 20, ASUCSD passed a 
resolution unanimously calling 
for a stronger enforcement of the 
UCSD Fair Trade Policy. Associate 
Vice President of Environmental 
and Social Justice and Fair Trade 
Committee member Jillian Du voiced 
support for the resolution at Tuesday’s 
UCAB meeting.

“We feel that it invalidates a very 
strong student campaign of five to six 
years,” Du told the Guardian. “The 
administration has been pushing its 
own agenda since last year to favor 
Starbucks coming in for the profit. We 
are very disappointed with the UCAB 
vote, particularly because they had a 
strong, sustainable option, and they 
did not give it adequate consideration. 

“We will continue fighting to 
restore UCSD’s fair trade policy to its 
original strength.”

According to UCEN Director 

Sharon Van Bruggen, a 2012 survey 
of 1,571 respondents (95 percent of 
which were UCSD students), showed 
that 71 percent of respondents sup-
ported bringing a Starbucks location 
to campus.

A Spring 2013 referendum that 
would have raised student fees $11 
per quarter to help fund close UCEN’s 
budget deficit and improve and main-
tain UCEN operations — namely in 
Price Center and the Old Student 
Center — was rejected by student vot-
ers. As a result, UCEN has struggled 
financially to maintain its current 
daily operations.

“It was mentioned during the dis-
cussion that it would lessen the bur-
den of the referendum, which is true 
— it would lessen it by a little bit — 
but there will still need to be a refer-
endum to get UCEN out of the deficit 
which has been going on for years,” 
King said. “I feel like the Fair Trade 
Policy needs to change, and people 
are currently working on that with the 
result of the UCAB discussion.”

No official date has been set, but 
remodeling could begin within the 
next 12 months.

The victim was taken to a local 

hospital. According to ABC 10 News, 
he sustained non-life-threatening 
injuries.

Shortly after the incident, students 
spoke to ABC 10 News regarding 
safety on campus.

“I take the bus here Monday 

through Friday, and I never think 
twice about my safety,” UCSD student 
Albert Trujillo said. “It’s just what 
is normal, and it’s on campus, and 
there’s a lot of people around, so it’s 
crazy that it happened.”

University Executive Director 
of Marketing, Media Relations and 
Public Affairs Jeff Gattas said that any 
information should be reported to 
UCSD police, who are continuing to 

investigate the incident.
“We believe it was a random 

attack,” Gattas said. “We’ve received 
lots of tips, and are continuing to look 
for tips.”

Information about this incident 
should be reported to the UCSD 
Police Department at 858-534-4357.

Things started out juicy at last 
night’s council meeting, but they 
slowly wound down to the usual level 
of (un)excitement. 

The tension and scandal com-
menced when former Judicial 
Board member Tanner Smith called 
Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student 
Life and overseer of A.S. Council 
operations 
Gary Ratcliff 
a “shit-bag” 
and accused 
Associated 
Students 
Director Heather Belk and A.S. 
Advisor and Daily Operations 
Manager Hayley Weddle of being paid 
by the administration to spy on coun-
cilmembers.

“I have come here to publicly 
out and shame them,” Smith said. 
“Remember, you don’t need them. 
They need you, and your money. 
Students have the power.”

These accusations came two weeks 
after formal disciplinary action was 
brought against Smith and 10 others 
for what he described as his use of 
free speech at Founder’s Day. Belk and 
Weddle were both named on the list 
of witnesses against Smith.

Smith ended his rant by saying, 
“Heather and Hayley, fuck you. I hope 
you remember this for a long time.”

After Smith left the podium, 
Weddle exited the Forum in tears.

To ease tensions, Council decided 
to move into a five-minute recess, 
which turned into a 10-minute recess 
to eat potluck food — even politi-
cians can’t help but eat their feelings 
— which, unsurprisingly, lasted lon-
ger than 10 minutes. When council 
returned to order, it was determined 
that Smith’s public input would be dis-
cussed at a later time.

AVP of Enterprise Operations 
Irene Chang then made a special pre-

sentation proposing to transition A.S. 
Lecture Notes to an online service 
called GradeBuddy. If it means we’ll 
feel better than UC Berkeley, whose 
A.S. Lecture Notes service went bank-
rupt and was discontinued last year, 
why not? Kidding. Maybe.

President Andy Buselt announced 
two projects slated for Winter Quarter 

2014: a bike path 
to be constructed 
alongside Library 
Walk and a Graffiti 
Art Park at the 
Student Center.

AVP Concert and Events Sarah 
Harley then announced that a Sun 
God Festival survey is up and run-
ning. She said that the survey results 
would be taken into serious account 
when deciding who performs at Sun 
God, so if you want a say, take the 
survey! (Psst! Do me a favor and vote 
for The Naked and Famous.)

After almost a year of arguing and 
promoting changes to confront the 
transportation crisis, a transporta-
tion referendum was passed without 
a single objection or complaint, and 
brushed over so quickly I hardly real-
ized it had passed. Congrats for pass-
ing the referendum, council, although 
its language was as ambiguous as the 
discussion was brief.

Council then moved on to bylaw 
revisions, passing several motions that 
aimed to improve council’s efficiency. 
An ironically inefficient amount of 
time was spent voting on whether to 
continue discussing or move on to a 
non-binding vote, then casting a non-
binding vote, and then vote, finally.

And, at long last, Council finally 
found a second Revelle Senator, just 
in time for the quarter to end. To 
the new Revelle Senator, enjoy three 
weeks of no work. That’s all from me 
for this quarter; good luck on finals to 
you all, and have a great break.

OPINION CONTACT THE EDITOR"#$%&'(()*#opinion@ucsdguardian.org

At UCSD, we are used to security. 
We stroll casually through cam-
pus long after sunset, and the blue 
emergency call boxes remain largely 
untouched. Yet, after Monday night’s 
stabbing at Center Hall, which sent 
one student to the hospital, we will 
all be looking over our shoulders 
and locking our doors. In its after-
math, the attack should be a compel-
ling wake-up call for administrators 
to step up campus safety.

Given that UCSD’s on-campus 
population exceeds 24,000 at any 
given time, it is worrying that there 
is such a sparse police presence. 
Although parking empty police 
cruisers in the middle of Ridge Walk 
may deter speedy skateboarders, 
only actual officers patrolling the 
campus paths will prevent scary 
incidents in the future and provide 
quicker incident response. Only nine 
law enforcement officers actively 
work away from the desk; two of 
them specialize in confiscating 
errant bicycles. This shortage is not 
helped by the fact that officers rarely 
make it to the periphery of campus 
— nary is a police officer ever seen 
around Eleanor Roosevelt College or 

Earl Warren College.
University administration 

should also reevaluate its priorities 
and make sure actual safety mat-
ters come first. Rather than plac-
ing surveillance cameras and foot 
patrols in obscure Mandeville halls 
to avoid occasional graffiti artists, 
enforcement should be distributed 
around campus to keep students 
out of harm’s way. The new traf-
fic lights on Gilman, Voigt and 
Library Walk indicate that there is 
some funding being appropriated 
for safety — those in charge should 
ensure that it is spent on the most 
effective measures.

Campus lighting is also a press-
ing issue. Several areas, such as the 
Sun God Lawn or the sinister forest 
between Geisel and Marshall, are 
eerily dark after 6 p.m. Though we 
get periodic emails asking us where 
we think lights should be placed, 
the administration needs to take 
some more decisive measures to 
resolve the problem. Halfhearted 
attempts to communicate the issue 
to largely indifferent students are 
not helping — a cursory inspection 
of campus dark spots and prompt 

construction is the only appropriate 
course of action.

There are other potential strate-
gies that the university can pursue 
moving forward. As the campus 
continues to develop with projects 
such as the bike paths, efforts should 
be made to maintain well-lit walk-
ing routes and bright open space. 
The university should also work to 
publicize the various services avail-
able to students. Community Service 
Officers and A.S. Safe Rides can help 
us out in a jam, but their usefulness 
is marginalized if their existence 
remains relatively unknown. It 
doesn’t help that students often feel 
rather awkward calling CSOs and 
rather elect to trek around campus 
by themselves. UCSD management 
needs to make a concerted attempt 
to communicate the resources avail-
able and make the most of them.

Although the horrible stabbing 
was the first such incident in recent 
times, the university should make 
sure that it prioritizes student safe-
ty. We hope that we won’t have to 
see any more violent events before 
some positive change is instituted 
on our campus.

“Smart” 
<MKPVWTWOa��
)N\MZ�)TT

I consider myself very far from a Luddite, but new ideas for wearable smart devices have 
become both annoyingly unneces-
sary and weird. 

Samsung has already sold 
800,000 pieces of its new Galaxy 
Gear smartwatch and Google is in 
the process of making its Google 
Glass follow-up. We haven’t devel-
oped a need for these products, 
yet so many of them continue 
to hit headlines as revolutionary 
new gadgets that will change our 
lives. The industry’s shift toward 
creating wearable technology is 
not gamechanging; many of these 
products actually reflect how much 
streamlined laziness society is start-
ing to allow. 

Technology research firm 
Gartner Inc. predicts that by 2016, 
the wearable technology industry 
will be worth some $10 billion, but 
I may lose all faith in humanity if I 
ever see smart earrings made with 
the purpose to whisper what the 
weather will be like tomorrow, or 
smart toilet paper to dispense itself 
in the restroom. 

If the “smart bra” does not 
already seem strange by name, you’ll 
definitely get weirded out by its pur-
pose. The bra’s prototype, designed 
and developed by Microsoft, is 
built with physiological sensors that 
researchers intend women to use to 
“track emotional moods and com-
bat overeating.” The sensors in the 
bra would warn women through a 
message on a mobile app to remind 
them of their diets before opening 
the refrigerator. 

Though the bra technology was 
not developed to become a com-
mercial product, the fact that the 
industry has shifted towards making 
technology to control our actions 
is alarming and assumes that we no 
longer have the agency to make deci-
sions ourselves. This type of invasive 
technology also loosely reminds me 
of AUTO, the evil steering wheel in 
Wall-E that made all the humans 
stay on the space shuttle for years 
and get terribly fat. 

Wearable technology is not with-
out its safety controversies either; they 
force the government to make new 
legislation to enforce common sense. 
A month ago, a San Diego resident 
was issued a ticket for driving on the 
freeway while wearing Google Glass. 
The police officer charged her for dis-
tracted driving because of the nature 
of Glass and its many multi-tasking 
abilities. The woman argues that her 
Glass was not activated and is now 
fighting the case, but the safety con-
cerns regarding those that drive while 
wearing Glass are not unwarranted. 
Glass makes it harder for enforcement 
to catch people who choose to watch 
a video on YouTube or surf the web 
while driving, which leads me to won-
der why we’re spending time to imple-
ment additional legislations to keep 
the roads safe, just to allow a product 
that isn’t saving lives or finding a cure 
for cancer.

If the wearable technology indus-
try is really going to explode into bil-
lions of dollars, I’d like to see some 
products that can actually be useful 
for health and medical fields. But for 
now, call me a 70-year-old woman 
who can’t cope with changing times; 
no one really needs these new kinds 
of wearable technology. 

Tuesday’s University Centers Advisory Board vote that paved the way for the closing of Espresso Roma marks a few 
major milestones for Price Center. Besides the 
obvious predisposed popularity of the new 
tenant (a small coffee and tea chain called 
“Starbucks”), Price Center will finally be able 
to stop investing in of one of its biggest money 
pits. Apart from the UCSD Bookstore-owned 
Perks Coffee Shop, Roma was the only tradi-
tional coffee place in the center of campus.

For a variety of reasons, Roma’s popularity 
with the coffee-consuming constituency 
never really took off to a point where it was 
consistently turning a profit. Housing and 
Dining Services began selling several select 
Starbucks brews in most of its places and 
markets a few years ago while other spots on 
campus like Fairbanks Coffee, Peet’s Coffee & 
Tea and the Mandeville Cart have given stu-
dents on the go enough reason to pass up on 
Roma. As a result, the business has never really 
been able to capture our hearts (or wallets) and 
its past time for it to be laid to rest.

There is no question that Starbucks will 
change the financial and social landscape of 
Price Center. The proximity to Geisel Library 
and its centrality within Price Center — let 
alone its massive international marketing 
supremacy — will attract far more patrons 
than Roma ever did, which will help Price 
Center maintain its operations. The added 
traffic will help breathe new life and energy 
into Price Center and may drive more social 
meet ups and study groups to take place there.

Some opponents of the move to bring 
Starbucks to campus have cited the Fair Trade 
issues that come with the coffee giant and say 
that a Starbucks on campus will violate the 
Fair Trade agreement championed by former 
UCSD Chancellor Marye Anne Fox in 2009 
and enacted in 2010. Cafe Roma — as well as 
all other coffee-sold, exclusively Fair Trade 
products in accordance with that agreement 
— and some are worried that a Starbucks 
on campus will violate it. However, after the 
agreement was updated earlier this year to 
allow Fair Trade certification by third-party 
organizations, both Starbucks and the other 
finalist to replace Roma (Sacramento-based 
Java City Eco-Grounds) qualify as “Fair Trade” 
as mandated by the UCSD agreement

Whether UCSD needs to revisit its 
commitment to Fair Trade policies is irrel-
evant in conversations because of the dire 
financial issues University Centers has been 
facing. In 2012, budget cuts mandated the 
closure of the Crafts Center in the Old 
Student Center and UCEN has repeatedly

Dear Editor,
As the 72nd Day of Infamy, this 

next Saturday, approachs [sic], there 
has already had a very limited debate 
in Japan, and the Liberal Democratic 
Party-led government has decided 
to remilitarize. Meanwhile, Japanese 
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. 
Vice President Joe Biden have urged 
China to withdraw its newly declared 
air defense identification zone.

And our woman in 
Tokyo, Caroline Kennedy, stipulates 
that the two governments will not 
allow China to change the status quo 
in the East China Sea — the Senkakus 
— by use of force. However, neither 
she nor they have alluded to Japan’s 
new secrecy law, which imposes 
a stiff sentence on whistleblowers. 
Ms. Kennedy make some assuring 
remarks during her Sept. 19, 2013 
confirmation hearing: “In my books 
on the Bill of Rights and the Right 
to Privacy, I sought to engage young 
audiences in the debate over our fun-
damental rights and to give them the 
tools and understanding to advance 
and defend our liberties ... I first 
visited Japan in 1978 with my Uncle, 
Senator Kennedy, and was deeply 
affected by our visit to Hiroshima.” 

The first female United States 
Ambassador dispatched to Tokyo 
enjoys a close relationship with 
President Barack Obama, having co-
chaired the President’s successful 2012 
re-election bid.  The 55-year-old 
envoy, an ex-attorney said that she 
feels proud to “carry forward my 
father’s legacy of public service. This 
appointment has a special significance 
as we commemorate the 50th anni-
versary of my father’s Presidency ... I 
am conscious of my responsibility to 
uphold the ideals he represented — a 
deep commitment to public service, 

a more just America and a more 
peaceful world. As a World War II 
veteran who served in the Pacific, my 
father had hoped to be the first sit-
ting President to make a state visit to 
Japan.” 

“Our countries,” said Ms. 
Kennedy, “are bound by deep politi-
cal, economic, cultural and strategic 
ties and our partnership has a global 
reach. We share a commitment to 
freedom, human rights and the rule of 
law. Japan is the world’s third largest 
economy, our fourth largest trading 
partner and the second largest source 
of foreign direct investment in the 
United States. Also, Japan is home to 
50,000 U.S. troops, the Seventh Fleet 
and 170,000 American citizens. As 
the United States rebalances toward 
Asia, our alliance with Japan remains 
the cornerstone of peace, stability, and 
prosperity in the region, as it has been 
for more than 50 years.”  

It’s necessary to reemphasize a 
couple of points. One is that ten-
sions between Japan and China are 
higher than at any time since the end 
of World War II. The issue of the 
Senkaku islands, although unknown 
to most Americans, is very high on 
the agenda of both Japan and China. 
There have been incidents of signifi-
cant tension in that region, and there 
has been movement of Chinese ships 
there and a military presence. Do you 
share my concern about this situation? 
MS. KENNEDY: It’s a matter of grave 
concern.

demonstrated a need for more 
funding to maintain and expand 
Price Center operations. A Spring 
2013 referendum to raise student 
fees to pay for would have reopened 
the Crafts Center and possibly 
opened up more 24-hour areas 
of Price Center. Unfortunately 
for UCEN, students rejected the 
$11-per-quarter fee increase with 
over 61 percent of voters saying 
“Nay” or abstaining. As a result, 
money becomes a bigger factor for 
UCAB, and a common solution to 
the money and failing Roma prob-
lems came in Tall, Grande and Venti 
varieties. Starbucks’ mission on 
campus will not only be to put cof-

fee in your mouth, but to help Price 
Center find its financial footing.

A.S. Council’s unanimously 
passed Nov. 20 resolution to 
increase Fair Trade enforcement 
on campus seems to be a veiled dig 
at Starbucks’ impending presence 
on campus. Additionally, nearly all 
the public input at Tuesday’s UCAB 
meeting seemed to support Java 
City (or rather, oppose Starbucks) 
but UCEN Cannot afford to let Fair 
Trade supersede fiscal responsibil-
ity in this case — particularly when 
Starbucks is still certified by an 
approved third party.

Those unhappy with the decision 
to put Starbucks on campus are in 
the minority. According to UCEN 
head Sharon Van Bruggen, an over-

whelming 71 percent of respondents 
to the 2012 University Centers 
Retail Survey were in favor of add-
ing the coffee giant to campus. The 
addition of Starbucks also reflects a 
big-picture effort by UCEN to make 
Price Center more of a one-stop 
shop for student needs and services 
— demonstrated with the early 
2013 opening of Salon 101 and the 
planned 2014 opening of the D’Lush 
lounge next to Sunshine Market

Contract negotiations between 
Starbucks and UCEN will need to be 
finalized before the crowned siren 
makes her way to Price Center. But 
Roma needs to be shown the door 
as soon as possible, and Starbucks is 
the right choice at this point in time 
to replace it.

This year, A.S. Concerts and Events 
nailed the Sun God Festival. We applaud-
ed the team for getting up and coming 
hip-hop artist Kendrick Lamar, disc jock-
ey Porter Robinson and indie-rock band 
Portugal. the Man at Sun God 2013.

The mullet-clothing trend could not have died any sooner; the 
high-low skirt trend is out and the ‘90’s are back in. Say hello 
(again) to crop tops, high-waisted everything and flannel plaids 
tied around the waist. It’s officially acceptable to go thrifting or 
borrow (some of) your mom’s old clothes.

We wish we could 
say UCSD got 
better dining hall 
food this year, 
but since Plaza 
Cafe died and was 
replaced by an 
Incredi-Bowls food

guess we’ll forever 
live in the culinary 
shadow of UCLA.

It seems like Council will never get out of the woods. Council was able 
to have the smallest over-allocation in the budget, but still put money 
in the wrong places. What we want is money for our student orgs, not 
money to fund freer pancake breakfasts.

3 A.S. Council held more accountable for how it spends money

What Didn’t Happen

We asked for modest 
tuition hikes, and we got 
none at all. Last month, 
UC President Napolitano 
announced that our tuition 
would stay at the same rate 
for another year. Keeping 
a UC education affordable 
should always be a top 
priority. Let’s hope we can 
keep this consistent in 2014.

AMERICAN
HUSTLE

INSIDE
LLEWYN DAVIS

OUT OF THE
FURNACE

THE HOBBIT:
THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG

W hat’s more American than a well-organized scam? After last year’s “Silver Linings Playbook,” director David O. Russell is 
back with his latest effort, “American Hustle.” 

The film is inspired by the ABSCAM scandal of 
the 1970s, in which an inquiry of stolen property 
unearthed federal corruption, shameless bribery 
and phony foreign investments. Christian Bale 
(“American Psycho”) plays a con man working for 
an FBI agent (Bradley Cooper, “The Hangover”). 
Investigating the matter, the two are drawn into a 
world of deception, which is as alluring as it is dan
gerous. Bale portrays a man in limbo between moral
ity and immorality. Jennifer Lawrence (“The Hunger 
Games”) as Bale’s wife is refreshing as both comic 
relief and a femme fatale. 

“American Hustle” comments on political corrup
tion, but raw emotions and character relationships 
are what propel the story — part crime investigation, 
part social commentary, part relationship drama.

Greenwich Village, 1960s: an enclave of America’s counter-culturists. 
Implicit yet often overlooked during these times, however, are the 
struggles faced by the offbeat residents of this New York City neigh-
borhood. And never ones to shy away from portraying a grim reality, 
directors Joel and Ethan Coen present “Inside Llewyn Davis,” a drama 
detailing a week of fictional folk singer Llewyn Davis’s (Oscar Isaac) 
life in The Village. The film ebbs and flows with Davis as he braves the 
harsh realities of his career, elucidating the cruel, tumultuous world in 
which he exists.

The film already received the prestigious Grand Prix at the Cannes 
Film Festival, and considerable praise has been awarded to the cast, 
including Carey Mulligan and John Goodman. The Coen brothers seem 
to have created another brutally honest film, taking a poignant look at a 
talented but fatefully unlucky and underappreciated man.

“Out of the Furnace” will prove to viewers that age can’t stop an 
older brother’s natural instinct to protect his little brother. As a poor, 
blue-collar factory worker in the Rust Belt, Russell’s (Christian Bale) 
tough life only gets harder when his brother Rodney’s (Casey Affleck) 
gambling debt leads him to work for a deranged drug lord, DeGroat 
(Woody Harrelson), but when Rodney disappears, Russell will stop at 
nothing to find him.

This will be director Scott Cooper’s sophomore film after “Crazy 
Heart,” and he is leading a talented cast of Oscar winners and nominees. 
The film also features Forest Whitaker as Police Chief Barnes, Willem 
Dafoe as Rodney’s bookie John, Zoe Saldana as Russell’s girlfriend Lena 
and Sam Shepard as Uncle Red. This will be a thriller that brings the 
audience along a haunted man’s journey in America’s crumbling Rust 
Belt to save his younger brother.

Loyal Tolkien fans were unnerved when director Peter Jackson ended “The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey” without 
including some pivotal events from the book. Now, the time has come for Jackson to pay up in the form of “The Hobbit: 
The Desolation of Smaug,” the second in a three-part movie series based on Tolkien’s novel.

In the first film, Thorin (Richard Armitage) and his company, Bilbo (Martin Freeman) and Gandalf (Ian McKellen), 
set out to reclaim the dwarves’ homeland. Their wayward encounters left a trail of vengeful enemies in their wake. Bilbo, 
the hobbit who at first refused adventure, will find himself becoming an unlikely hero. Meanwhile, old rivalries will fer-
ment into the likes of war.

“The Desolation of Smaug” is a multitude of unfurling tales. Precision archery, a dragon and battles between agile 
elves and ferocious foes can only improve the underdog story at the heart of this film.

THE SECRET LIFE
OF WALTER MITTY

hat’s more American than a well-orga-
nized scam? 

After last year’s “Silver Linings 
Playbook,” director David O. Russell is 

back with his latest effort, “American Hustle.” 
The film is inspired by the ABSCAM scandal of 

the 1970s, in which an inquiry of stolen property 
unearthed federal corruption, shameless bribery 
and phony foreign investments. Christian Bale 
(“American Psycho”) plays a con man working for 
an FBI agent (Bradley Cooper, “The Hangover”). 
Investigating the matter, the two are drawn into a 
world of deception, which is as alluring as it is dan-
gerous. Bale portrays a man in limbo between moral-
ity and immorality. Jennifer Lawrence (“The Hunger 
Games”) as Bale’s wife is refreshing as both comic 
relief and a femme fatale. 

“American Hustle” comments on political corrup-
tion, but raw emotions and character relationships 
are what propel the story — part crime investigation, 
part social commentary, part relationship drama.

Every family has more complex relationships than meet the eye, and 
“August: Osage County” is a film about ripping the covers off, expos-
ing every secret and then getting through it all together. Violet (Meryl 
Streep) is mother to three daughters who are reunited after their father’s 
(Sam Shepard) death. Violet has a blunt personality and a pill-popping 
habit. 

The oldest daughter, Barbara (Julia Roberts), is struggling to pull her 
life together, while younger daughter Ivy (Julianne Nicholson) is crush-
ing on her cousin and baby sister Karen (Juliette Lewis) shows up with 
a new fiance.

“August: Osage County” will make your own family feel much less 
crazy than you think it is. In a home with so m uch tension, a meltdown 
is inevitable. So if, during the holidays, you feel overwhelmed by your 
own family, look no further than this film to lift some stress off your 
shoulders.

Most people don’t know that “Mary Poppins” didn’t start out as 
a Disney production. “Saving Mr. Banks” is the story of Walt Disney 
(Tom Hanks) in 1961 as he fights for creative control over “Mary 
Poppins” with its author, Pamela Travers (Emma Thompson). Directed 
by John Lee Hancock, whose previous film “The Blind Side” was a 
heartwarming success, “Saving Mr. Banks” will surely follow the trend.

Despite initial apprehensions of casting Hanks as Walt Disney, the 
two-time Oscar winner embodies the spirit of Disney with a jolly cha-
risma. Contrarily, Travers is acerbically guarded, but beyond her snarky, 
caustic disposition, a human quality emerges from her love for Mary 
Poppins as a character and story. From the cast’s humorous arguments 
with Travers to heartfelt moments that provide a family-friendly ambi-
ence, “Saving Mr. Banks” will prove satiating for audiences fascinated by 
a unique story that adds dimension to Disney culture, which will surely 
impress its target audience: Disney fanatics.

From rescuing cats out of exploding buildings to jumping out of 
helicopters into the sea, Walter Mitty’s life is anything but ordinary — 
except none of it is real. 

Based off of a short story by James Thurber, “The Secret Life of 
Walter Mitty” depicts a man (Ben Stiller) whose mundane life is con-
stantly interrupted by his daydreams. When Mitty’s job at Life magazine 
is threatened, he embarks on a global journey in search of a missing 
photograph. With dreamy, jet-lagged, panoramic shots of his adven-
tures, the film invites viewers to determine whether Mitty’s escapades 
are real or a product of his imagination. 

“The Secret Life of Walter Mitty” boasts a cast known for comedy 
(Kristen Wiig, Ben Stiller and Sean Penn), who will provide much-
needed comic relief in contrast to the serious undertones. The film 
promises a heartwarming story of an imaginative man who finally 
learns to take initiative. 

“Her” is a love story, but it’s not between two people. Instead, the film, directed 
by Spike Jonze (“Being John Malkovich”), follows Joaquin Phoenix falling not for a 
woman but for a computer operating system that sounds a lot like iPhone digital assis-
tant Siri. Except this Siri has Scarlett Johansson’s voice, so no one can really blame him.

The story is set in futuristic Los Angeles, where ultra-advanced computers have 
personalities so rich that people like Phoenix’s character become enamored with them. 
It’s portentous, or, perhaps, indicative of where society already is — a place where a 
romance between a human and computer is believable. Regardless of the philosoph-
ical-cultural-technological aspects of the story, the fact that such a bizarre premise is 
even a viable feature film is a testament to the acting talents of Phoenix and Johansson 
and the directing talents of Jonze. Hopefully, Johansson wins an award for “Her,” so 
that we actually get to see her — not just hear her — at the ceremony.

BACON LOVERS
BY AVI SALEM CONTRIBUTING WRITER

GAME OF THRONES FANS
BY HILLARY DAKIN STAFF WRITER

Nothing says “Merry Christmas” like drink-
ing games to your favorite movies, includ-
ing “Mean Girls,” “American Pie” and “The 
Hangover.”  Complete with movie-themed 
cocktails, “Lights, Camera, Booze” will help 
you catch up with your friends over winter 
break and get belligerent along the way.

If George Knightley isn’t conveniently 
nearby to kiss your boo-boo away, slap 
on a quote and imagine him in your 
mind. This package of 15 plasters (the 
British word for Band-Aids, in case 
you didn’t know) feature images of Jane 
Austen and quotes from her popular 
works. They come in a reusable tin and 
are latex-free. 

What better way to enjoy the 
holidays than with the delightful 
scent of bacon wafting through the 
house? Bacon-scented candles are 
the perfect holiday gift for friends 
or family who can’t get enough 
of that sizzling bacon smell that 
to lure them out of bed on a lazy 
Saturday morning.

For the cute couple who watches “Game of 
Thrones” religiously every week, buy this set 
of engraved rings, printed with the words, 
“My sun and stars” and “Moon of my life.” 
Matching rings reinforce a couple’s love and 
offers a way to share their love for the show.

This is the for the person who drinks like a 
bartender but has no bartending skills at all. 
The Mix Master Cocktail Shaker is transpar-
ent, so you can follow measuring lines under 
each drink recipe for a perfect cocktail every 
time. The shaker comes with six popular reci-
pes, like Sex on the Beach and White Russians.

An easy, cheap Alice in Wonderland gift would 
be a themed mug and a box of tea. Cafepress, 
which specializes in personalized clothing and 
accessories, features thousands of adorable Alice 
mugs — and most are under $20. Tea to go with 
the mugs is an easy purchase at any supermar-
ket. We suggest a choosing festive flavor, such 
as Stash Tea’s “Christmas Morning Black Tea” or 
“Holiday Chai Tea.”

A sword-shaped letter opener is the ideal gift 
for business-minded “Game of Thrones” fans. 
Buy this to remind them of their favorite show 
while they’re too busy going through the mail. 
This is also the perfect gift for any fans who 
like owning tiny swords.

If you’re a Jane Austen fan, you probably have 
all the books and memorized all the quotes. 
But are they wearable? This handmade, 
super-soft cotton jersey knit scarf is the 
exact cream color of a well-worn book and is 
printed with the original text of “Persuasion.” 
With the holiday romance abound, maybe 
someone will come closer to get a better look 
at what is written there.

Has your friend written “Mrs. Darcy” all 
over her copy of “Pride and Prejudice,” even 
though she knows that he’ll never be hers? 
Well, now it’s time to make her dreams 
come true by personalizing a Jane Austen 
novel to add to her collection — and her 
heart. Novels are available in either ebook 
or paperback form.

WORLD TOUR

Pomegranate

BY TEDDI FALLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER
ILLUSTRATION BY JENNY PARK & LEO BUI

M ost people think of vodka when they think of Russians, but Pomegranate will intro-
duce you to magical new sets of 
spice combinations familiar to our 
friends across the Pacific. Located 
in North Park, Pomegranate offers 
a cozy atmosphere and filling food 
for a relaxing — but also culturally 
interesting — dinner. Once inside, 
parking can be a little frustrating at 
first, as there is no restaurant-owned 
lot, but street parking is plentiful 
along the surrounding blocks.

When you walk in, Pomegranate’s 
dimmed lighting will barely allow 
you to make out families dining, 
couples on dates and business meet-
ings in progress. All the tables have 
beautifully unique lamps — one 

lamp even uses a cowboy figurine as 
a lamp stand. The most noticeable 
decorations in the restaurant are 
handwritten messages from past cus-
tomers that cover the walls, ranging 
from Russian sayings to food recom-
mendations and even a drawing of a 
dog smoking a cigar. 

After you’ve been seated, a server 
will bring you a bread basket with 
garlic-flavored olive oil to dip and 
green, thyme-flavored butter to 
spread. While you fill up on bread 
and deceptively delicious green but-
ter, Pomegranate’s salad sampler 
platter (price varies depending on 
party size) is a great group appetizer 
that features Russian coleslaw, cab-
bage salad and a potato salad, among 
others. This will work for those 

friends who want to order every last 
item on the menu, but can’t afford 
to do so.

Three dishes at Pomegranate 
are ideal to introduce the amateur 
epicurean to the Russian palate: the 
borscht, a beet soup with beef ($9); 
the stroganoff, beef cooked in a sour 
cream sauce and served over pasta 
($17) and khachapuri, a Georgian 
cheese pie ($7.50). Luckily for veg-
etarians, the borscht and stroganoff 
dishes can be made vegetarian or 
vegan (meat is substituted with 
mushrooms), and the Khachapuri is 
vegetarian already. 

At first, the vegetarian stroganoff 
($14) looks to be a steamed vegetable 
salad with some sour cream, but 
laying at the bottom of the bowl is 

a concoction of vegetable juices and 
Pomegranate’s “secret” house mix 
of Russian spices, in which thyme is 
a prominent flavor. It comes with a 
side of rice and a baked potato for 
added starch.

For meat eaters looking for 
something more adventurous, the 
golubtsi, two cabbage rolls stuffed 
with ground meat and herbs 
($15.50), will fill you up — and 
then some. The rolls, which are 
smothered in a thick cheese sauce, 
take up the entire plate. 

Before you enter a food coma, 
though, try a dessert, namely, the 
Babushka Surprise ($7) — a honey-
baked apple stuffed with dried fruits 
and walnuts and served with fresh 
plum and apple slices and a scoop 

of ice cream. If you want to go with 
something untraditional, try the 
Toad Sweat ice cream ($6). It’s not 
made of toads, but it will make you 
sweat like one; its vanilla ice cream 
with cayenne pepper-infused choco-
late sauce to make it spicy.

Pomegranate doesn’t just serve 
great food; it also provides a won-
derful environment. Before you 
leave, ask the bar for a Sharpie and 
write a little something on the wall. 
Maybe a new customer will discover 
it, or maybe it will remind you of 
your last visit for the next time you 
give into your cravings for Russian-
Georgian cuisine.

L et’s talk about sex, baby. I’m kidding. We’re talking about computer science majors, liter-
ally, the opposite. I would love to give 
them my Triton Side-Eye, but even 
peripheral vision is pushing it.

It’s worth stating that CS majors 
are total geniuses; I’ll be the first to 
admit I could never. That doesn’t 
mean they aren’t 
freaks. I’ve had the 
great misfortune 
of taking a com-
puter science class 
during my time at 
UCSD, and it wasn’t even the easiest 
one (it was the second). One tearful 
call to my mother and a hasty major 
change later, I am now in the posi-
tion to talk about my scars. Luckily, 
my scars aren’t covered in grease, 
unlike several of my lab partners, 
who “weren’t available to work with 
me anymore” after we completed one 
project. Seriously, computer science 
was so not for me, and thank Lorde. 

Computer science is apparently 
the new “super-major,” which I under-
stand, since smartphone applications 
continue to be such a big thing. Good 
for apps. It’s fitting that computer 
science majors are so involved with 
technology, because I’m not convinced 
they are actually people. I have, after 
all, spoken to more than one of them. 
A conversation with a computer 
science academic, is crazy surreal. 
They speak in the same way they use 
programming languages: succinct 
and unsettlingly impersonal. Perhaps 
things would have gone differently for 
me if I had mentioned “Grand Theft 
Duty,” or whatever it is the kids are 
playing these days; apparently, I was 
stupid enough to enter a conversation 
asking them about their day.

I realize I’m not one to talk about 
stereotypes, considering that old 
Whitney Houston performances make 
my gay nipples so hard they could cut 

diamond, but I’m sure as hell finding a 
way. You would, too, if you spent hun-
dreds of hours in a dungeon (formally 
the computer labs), wincing through 
the smell of Monster Energy drinks 
and unwashed Old Navy hoodies just 
to convincingly nod like you under-
stand what’s going on, your ever-
changing orgy of lab partners doing 

all the actual work 
in the meantime. 
Thanks for doing 
that, by the way.

The most hor-
rific part is that 

these few actually leave their rooms 
to work on projects. Many program 
there little hearts away in the comfort 
of dorm rooms that never see the light 
of day. The ones I have encountered 
are, in all likelihood, the most normal 
ones. My editor told me that typing in 
all caps is a “no-no,” but oh my god — 
we are breeding a generation of robots 
who control the way we navigate 
the world with technology, and that 
should terrify you. At a certain point, 
a cool Silicon Valley office — color-
ful plush chairs and all — isn’t going 
to inject enough humanity into these 
people to let them produce vibrant 
technology that doesn’t merely mas-
turbate over a screen-laden world. 

Again, these people are geniuses. 
If you know a computer science 
major, rip their hands away from the 
computer and drag them outside to 
smell the goddamn roses. “Smell the 
goddamn roses” is perfectly sufficient 
instruction. We could all probably 
stand to do it a little more ourselves. 
Seriously though, lend these souls a 
helping hand. San Diego is one of the 
most amazing cities in the world if 
you appreciate it. Tell them to leave 
their running shoes at home — I 
know you guys aren’t running any-
where — and join the world they, 
indeed, have a very good chance of 
improving.

“T he Hunger Games” was child’s play. In “Catching Fire,” what little inno-
cence was present in the first film is 
long gone as Katniss begins a grad-
ual — but inevitable — descent into 
apathy. Through intricate plot lay-
ers, new director Francis Lawrence 
(“Water for Elephants”) creates 
richer and rounder characters than 
the ones found in the books. 

This time around, the Games 
are more terrifying than ever, as 
Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and 
Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) are thrust 
back into the arena with past vic-
tors. Now facing experienced killers 
and certain death, Katniss is willing 
to do anything to keep Peeta alive. 

Despite this thrilling premise, 
“Catching Fire” still suffers from an 
unnecessary love triangle among 
Katniss, Peeta and Gale (Liam 
Hemsworth), which distracts view-
ers from the gravity of other events. 
After “winning” the Hunger Games 
the first time around, Katniss is 
unable to escape the traumatic 
aftermath of inadvertently killing 
22 people. She suffers from hal-
lucinations, unable to hunt without 
imagining that the animals she kills 
are real people.

Because the plot focuses on 

Katniss’ mental state, the romantic 
story falls flat — attention shifts 
from forced puppy love to the poli-
tics of the Games and the impend-
ing revolution in the districts. With 
each lingering look and kiss, the 
chemistry between Katniss and 
Gale feels less and less organic. 
While Lawrence and Hutcherson’s 
performances are nuanced and 
moving, Hemsworth’s perfor-
mance is forgettable. For a movie 
that thrives on desperation and 
suspense, the subplot inescapably 
slows the first half of the movie 
down. 

The movie picks up speed when 
it takes us into the inner mecha-
nisms of the Capitol. As they did 
in the first film, avid readers will 
appreciate the additional scenes 
between President Snow (Donald 
Sutherland) and the new Head 
Gamemaker (Philip Seymour 
Hoffman) in the Capitol. Although 
not in the books, the scenes pro-
vide insight into the calculated 
moves from Snow. 

One short scene near the begin-
ning best illustrates the absurdist 
world Katniss lives in. A Capitol 
schoolgirl tells Katniss what she 
wants to be just like her when she 
grows up: a tribute in the Games. 

A normal child would dream to 
be a doctor or novelist or lawyer, 
but this child, blind to any other 
options, vows to kill other children 
— she believes it to be a respectable 
achievement. The movie uses the 
stark disparities between our world 
and Katniss’ to draw out emotional 
despair from audiences: We can 
congratulate ourselves on being 
different from these characters, but 
the movie reminds us that we have 
the capacity to be equally barbaric. 

By the time the Games roll 
around, we are so invested in char-
acters from the past films that we 
don’t expect new ones to be well-
developed. However, when tributes 
and past victors Finnick Odair 
(Sam Claflin) and Johanna Mason 
(Jena Malone) are introduced, they 
elicit non-apathetic emotions from 
Katniss like no other character can. 
(Katniss’ face when Johanna strips 
naked in an elevator can only be 
described as GIF-worthy.) 

Overall, “Catching Fire” excels 
in producing unique character arcs. 
The film successfully unravels dark 
truths about human instinct — in 
and out of the battlefield.

Freshman guard Adam Klie led the Tritons in 
scoring last week in UCSD’s 77–59 win against the 
Academy of Art University. 

Coming off the bench, Klie — of Anchorage, 
Alaska — racked up 19 points on 6-of-9 shoot-
ing, while grabbing eight rebounds. Senior starting 
point guard James McCann chipped in 14 points, 
while 6-foot-11-inch sophomore forward Drew Dyer 
picked up 15 points.

“Klie is a talented kid, a strong, athletic kid,” 
UCSD head coach Eric Olen said to the UCSD 
Athletics Department. “He’s done a great job of just 
coming in and working hard every day. He picks 
things up really quickly, he competes all the time and 
always works to get better.”

The game was never close, as the Tritons went 
into the second half with a seven-point lead that they 
quickly extended into double digits. 

With the win, the Tritons improve to 3–1 as they 
head into California Collegiate Athletics Association 
conference play this Thursday, Dec. 5, when they will 
face a tough Humboldt State squad who finished sec-
ond in the CCAA with a 15–7 record.

The Tritons still managed to pull out the win in 
their last game of the tournament, even without the 
aid of junior starting guard Miranda Seto, which 
forced senior guard Megan Perry and junior guard 
Stephanie Yano to play the full 40 minutes, UCSD had 
contributions from around the roster.

“Everyone has to contribute every single play 
and every single possession, and I think we really 
did that tonight,” Perry said to the UCSD Athletics 
Department. 

Perry led the Tritons with her first double-double 
of the season (11 points on 12 rebounds). Junior for-
ward McKennan Bertsch also had a good game, scor-
ing eight points and nabbing eight rebounds, while 
Dautremont chipped in nine points.

The UCSD women’s basketball team went 2–0, improving to 4–1 this season, at the 
fourth annual UCSD Thanksgiving Classic, Nov. 29 to Nov. 30. 

Senior guard Megan Perry was named to the five-man all-tournament team, while 
senior forward Erin Dautremont earned the tournament’s most valuable player award.

UCSD begins conference play this Thursday, Dec. 5, on the road against Humboldt 
State. 

The UCSD women’s basketball team went into extra 
time for the second time in just four games in its 61–62 
overtime win against Metro State Friday, Nov. 29.

 Senior forward Erin Dautremont’s play on the block 
propelled the Triton attack. Scoring a game-high 26 
points, on 8-for-12 shooting, Dautremont — a four year 
starter, who had a couple of quiet games at the start of the 
season — was also perfect from three-point range, scor-
ing four for four.

The Tritons trailed through most of the game but 
were able to push into overtime when, with six seconds 
on the clock, Dautremont sunk both of her free throws, 
tying the score at 54–54. UCSD controlled the game after 
the break, going up in the first minute off a jumper by 
junior guard Miranda Seto, followed by a three-pointer 
by Dautremont in the next possession.

“It takes a lot of character for our team to step up and 
to do what we did tonight. It takes defensive stops back-
to-back. It takes working every possession,” Dautremont 
said to the UCSD athletics department. “We’ve got a good 
lineup out there that’s ready to go every night.”

T he No. 12 nationally ranked UCSD women’s volleyball team will play its first NCAA West Regional game this 
Thursday, Dec. 5, against Dixie State on the 
campus of Cal State San Bernardino.

Going in as the No. 3 seed, if the 
Tritons beat Dixie State this Thursday, they 
will face the winner of Friday’s match-up 
between No. 7 Alaska Anchorage (21–9) 
and No. 2 BYU-Hawaii (24–1).

The trip up to San Bernardino will 
mark UCSD’s eighth consecutive postsea-
son berth, while Dixie State will be making 
its first ever NCAA appearance.

UCSD has yet to face nationally 
unranked Dixie State (17–9 overall, 14–6 
in the Pacific West Conference) this sea-
son. But UCSD head coach Ricci Luyties 
said that he’s confident in his side — which 
includes four all-conference selections: 
junior middle blocker Sara McCutchan, 
sophomore setter Heidi Sierks, sophomore 
outside hitter Danielle Dahle and junior 
opposite Caitlin Brenton. 

“From what I’ve seen of [Dixie State], 
they look like they’re a good all-around 
team,” Luyties said on Triton Talk, a 
weekly online talk show. “We’re going to 
have to play well for sure. We’re going to 
have to have a lot of people have good 
games, but I think across the board we 
stack up pretty well against them.”

Though the Tritons have lost just five 
games this season, Luyties remains wary 

of Dixie State’s outside hitters Shannon 
Young and Maddie Rex, whom he lauded 
as “athletic” and both “able to move the 
ball around well.”

Young and Rex both have over 250 
kills this season and seem to be Dixie 
State’s main offensive threats.

But UCSD assistant coach Sean Cahill 
said the Tritons should be the winning 
side on Thursday if they can get good 
performances from their middle block-
ers, McCutchan and sophomore Kameron 
Cooper. 

“If our middle blockers play like they 
were in the beginning of the season, 
then we should be in pretty good shape,” 
Cahill said. “If we play together, and 
we play our style of volleyball, nobody 
should be able to touch us.”

Assuming the Tritons beat Dixie 
State, UCSD will face BYU-Hawaii, the 
team that knocked the Tritons out of the 
NCAA Tournament last season. Cahill 
said that the coaching staff has already 
started scouting second-seeded BYU-
Hawaii.

“We know that BYU-Hawaii has a 
good setter and a couple of middle block-
ers,” Cahill said. “They’ve had a very 
good season, but, again, I think we’re the 
more balanced team.”

The West Region title match is set 
for Saturday, Dec. 7 at Cal State San 
Bernardino.
