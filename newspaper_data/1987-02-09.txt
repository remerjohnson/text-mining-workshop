Safe sex week begins 
By TINA LUCAS 

T oda}' marks the beginnll1g of "Sa e ex Week," .I series of 
dIS uS~lons and films, being sponsored by tudent Health en'ices 
to II1crcase awareness and knowledge of sexually tran milled 

diseasc~ ( TDs). 
Chnstlne Oakley, the Women's Clinic Coord inatOr, stJted that 

the climc, in cooperation wah Pyschological Services and the 
Women's Resource Center, IS sponsoring this program to inform 

~tudenrs of the dangers posed by STD and of methods of 
prevcnllon. With prevention as the primal)' goal , Oakley saId that 
indIviduals should practice certain behaviors such as condom use 
and communication with their sexual partners 111 order to make sex 
less of a "risky business." 

STDs that individuals should be informed about Include syphilIS, 
herpes simplex lJ , gonorrhea, AIDS and chlamydia. Unfortunately, 
many students d not see themselves at risk in contracting these 
illnesses whether it be for a lack of knowledge or for reasons of poor 
communication with theIr sexual partners. Nevertheless, in some 

case~ IndIvIduals may b.: exposed to an STD and become J. camer 
without ever exhibiting any symptoms This often leads [" serious 
consequences. 

For II1StanCe, chlamydia is now believed to be the mo~t ..:ommon 
STD 111 the United States, JffectIng more than three million men 
and women annually, Of those mfeded, 60 to 0 pacent of the 
women and ten percent of the men .Ire unaware thar Ihe\' r :my the 
bactcrlum, since they have no symproms. If diagnosed cady

Ihey said "The Boys" had broken

Heading UEO's list of 
co ncerns is damage to university

concern that the group's actions, 
mc\uding spray painting locker 
rooms (used as dressmg rooms) 
and creating an unstable 
atmosphere in the crowd 
(possibly leadmg to serious 
damage to the gymnasium) made 
the risks too great to hold the

An open letter to the U C Regents 
By JON READ 

My suggestion. which will of 
course require world-wide 
support and pre ssure, IS that at a 
minimum , the Group of Six, 
supported by the IOJ non-
aligned nations, and assisted by 
Parliamentarians Global Action , 
should serve as a resource and 
safety net ro the present anns 
talks. 

If this fail s to yield substantial 
and ra pid results, then the 

to address th e questions ot Just 
h ow such a team should be 
selected , what disciplines should 
be represented , and how 
deciSion-making should be 
structured and accountability 
insured . Representa tives of the 
Group of Six would playa key 
role in struc tunng the confere nce 
and representatives from all the 
world 's leadi ng unive rsities 
should be invited. 

A first step would be for the 

regents , assi sted by Presid ent 
Gardner and the chancello rs, to 
appOint a committee of those 
professors known inte rnationally, 
not only fo r stature in their 
fields, but for their concern , 
evenha ndedness and impeccable 
Integrity . The would investigate 
the possibility of such an 
undertaking and do the 
groundwork to bring it about. 

The second suggestion is that 
the regents appoint a second 

committee of similar stature to 
oversee the holding of hearings 
and workshops on evel)' UC 
campus to detennine if third 
pa rty intercession is, in fact, the 
only and best alte rnative to the 
prese nt strategy. A secondal)' 
goal would be to get the facts 
about Star Wars out in the open. 
If there was substantial student 
participation in the planning 
and operation of such a 
program, it could contribute 

toward foc usi ng anticipated 
campus activism in a 
construc tive d irec tion th is 
spring. 

It is not suggested that the 
university's original motive of 
enhancing national security be 
abandoned . On th e contrary, 
only tha t a strategy that actually

Riley writes 
Editor: 

We are writing in response to 
the concerns espressed by Andy 
Howard et al regarding the 
Associated Students Constitution 
In his lener to the editor dated 
1/29/87. By responding to each 
of Howard 's asse rt ions we will 
not only prove their lack of rruth , 
but also convey to students how 
the current student government 
system does indeed work well . 

1) The present AS. electoral 
system works best for a student 
govemment. Under the current 
s),stem stud ents vote for a 
President, vice preSidents, and 
class senators , each with a 
specific and unique job 
descripti on . Each office has 
c1early-defmed responsibility and 
thus, there exists an efficient and 
appropriate delegation of 
authority (e.g. the Commissioner 
of Programming IS responsible 
fo r programming, etC.) 

Howard advocates a system of 
proportional representation 
under whic h a part}' IS awarded 
Council seats proportional to 
th eir number of votes. ThiS 
system can only exist when all 
elected positions are IdentIcal; 
thus, there ceases to eXist a 
coherent system of delegation of 
responsibility. According to the 
electoral systems specialist 
Professor Arend 
Lijphart," . . . proportional 
representation simply cannOt 

work when voting for specific 
offices I e.g. President, Senator 
etc.]" 

2) The present AS. system 
encourages student involvement. 
The A.S. seeks appointments to 
doze ns of d ifferent committees 
and has extended efforts to 
increase student input. While 
time fo r student input is not fully 
taken advantage of. the AS. 
Council will extend time to any 
student who needs additional 
time to express his/ her views: 

At a school of over 12,000 
students, a representative 
government is necessal)' in order 
to be efficient and productive. 
However, efforts are continually 
bei ng made to seek out the 
concerns of students and remain 
responsive to constituent needs. 

3) The AS. adopts a finn 
policy all owing and encouraging 

Letters to the editor should 
be double- or triple-spaced 
and addressed to the Opinions 
Editor, the UCSD Guardian , 
8-016, La Jolla , 92093. All 
submissions must include the 
author's phone number and 
signature; in specicJI cases the 
name will be withheld upon 
reques t. Th e Guardia n

clarity and space considrnltions, 

all students to vote . Due to 
overenrollment last Spring, the 
Cashier's offi ce failed to 
document the registration of all 
UCSD undegrads prior to th e 
A.5. elec tion. Therefore, a second 
election was held to allow all 
students to vote . T his yea r, 
however, the Associate Students 
has taken care to rectify this 
problem by changing election 
regulations to allow for 
alternative forms of verification 
of enrollment. 

Howard recommends holding 
the elections as late as the fourth 
or fifth week of Spring Quarter. 
Clearly, this is un necessary and 
will only serve to discourage 
students from running for office 
for academic reasons. 

4) The A S. Council has 
proven its resolve to uphold 
student referenda. Just in the 
past year, the AS. has upheld 
student initiatives by enacting 
legislation on the following 
referenda issues: South Africa 
and divestment, funding fo r 
alternative media, promotion of a 
UCSD parking shuttle, and 
greater attention to UCSD 
athletics. 

The A S. Council has limited 
authori ty with respect to 
enforcement of certain refere nda 
results; many decis ions are 
entirely made by the 
Administration. However the AS. 
will not hesitate to demand that 
the student voice be heard. 

5) The AS. has conSistently 
held a policy whic h bases 

funding appropria tions on 
p riciples of fairness and equal 
opportunity. These princi ples are 
incorpora ted with considera tion 
of an appropriation's benefit to 
the student body and the 
requestor's demons trated need 
and fi scal respons ibili ty. 

Howard asserts that the 
Committee for W orld Democracy 
received "a politically-motivated 
budget cut," when in fact, they 
received an increase of $1.123 . 

We respect the right of 
students to hold a constitutional 
convention . However, the current 
system works weU , and in fact, 
we have spent a significant 
portion of our tenn in office on 
its improvement. W e have 
revised Election and Financial 
By-Laws, as well a s expanded 
current programs and offices in 
areas suc h as Exte rnal Affairs, 
Programming, Academic Affairs, 
and se rvices such as the Grove 
Caffe, Volunteer Connection , 
Lecture otes, etc . 

We support inc reased stabili ty 
in the curre nt Cons titutional 
system in order that we ma}, 
more effec tively represent a ll of 
the d iverse students of UCSD. 
W e do no t see a new 
constitution , as Andy Howard 
advocates, as the answer to the 
alleged problems. Rather, we ask 
fo r even greater stud ent 
involveme nt and pa rtici pation.

proposed were: tripling security, 
bringing in mobile homes as 
dreSSi ng rooms and proViding 
barracades for crowd control 
beyond the standard barriers 
found at UCSD concerts. 

Southland Concerts' proposals 
were not adequate to insure 
stuJem safety and proper facihty 
maintenance, according to Stack. 
"I still didn't feel comfortable, 
even with Southland 's ncw 
provisions." 

" an Diego is paying for the 
neglect of other promoters. They 
(UEO ) are looking OUt for the 
safety of the facility and the 
future of having concerts in the 
gym. ot knowing me or the 
company, but only other 
experiences ... they didn 't have 
faith in me," Peterson of 
Southland Concerts explained. 

The deciSion to cancel the 
concert was bdsed primarily on 
inCldems at Western 
WashIngton UniverSity (WWU ) 
during a recem performance in 
BellIngham. Michael Healy, 
Events Service Coordinator a[ 
WWU , down-played any damage 
[hat occurred. 

-They (The Boys') did not 
destroy our dressing room nor 
did they destroy our facIlities. I 
wouldn't say they were neat and 
tidy, but they weren't 
destructive," said Healy.

some mayhem; there 
always is", but it

problems at the Washington 
show as being a result of a bad 
stage that broke midway through 
the performance and the usage 
of the school's rugby team as 
bouncers. 

Murphy's Law, the first of two 
opening bands touring with the 
Beastie Bo),s, were involved in a 
conflict between the bouncers 
and fans. At one point during 
(heir set, a member of Murphy's 
Law, apparently upset with the 
security'S handling of the crowd , 
kicked a bouncer in the back of 
the head and announced to the 
fan , "These people are your 
gestapo: you have to run them 
over." 

Adler, not cond on ing the 
actions of Murphy's Law, stated , 
"They I the' bouncers] were 
hassling our fans. It was like 
pultlng the Nazi youth at a civil 
liberty march ," 

Healy didn 't blame the crowd 
control on the boun ers, but 
rather on the barriers. "Our 
barriers and stage Wele not 
strong enough for the type of 
audience where slam dancing is 
accepted , I think stronger 
baITIers mighl have simply been 
enough to remedy the problem .

'The A. .: A System for Students" 
We are wnnng In respon e to the concern expressed by Andy Howard et al. 
regarding the AsSOCiated tudents Constitution in his letter to the GuardlllH 
editor dated 1 291 87 B)' responding to each of Howa rd 's assertions we Wt\1 not 
anI}' plove their lack of truth , but also convey to students how the current 
student government system does tndeed work well. 
1) The present A.S. electoral system works beSl for a student government. 
Under the current s)'stem students vote for a president, vice preSident and class 
senators, ea h wah a speCific and unique Job description . Each oITtce has 
dearly-defmed responslblltty and thus , there eXists and efficient and 
appropriate delegation of authoriry (e.g the Commissioner of Programming is 
responSible for programming, etc .) 

Howard advocates a system of proportional representation under which a 
parry is awarded Council seats proportional to their number of votes. This 
system can onl), exist when all elected position are identical; thus, there ceases 
to exist a coherent system of delegation of responsibiliry. Accord ing to the 
electoral s},stems speclahst Professor Arend LiJphart, ". proportional 
representation Simply cannot work when voting for speCific officers (e.g. 
preSident, senator. etc.)" 
2 ) The present AS , sySlem encourages Sludent involvement. The AS. seeks 
appOIntments to dozens of different committees and has extended efforts to 
Increase student Input. While time for student input is nOl fully taken advantage 
of. the A Coun 11 Will extend time to any student who needs additional time to 
express hiS her views 

At as hool of over 12,000 students, a representauve government is necessa ry 
in order to be effiCient and productive. However, effons are continually being 
made to seek out the concerns of students and remaIn responSive to constituent 
needs. 
3 ) The A.S. adopts a firm policy aUowing and encouraging all students to vole, 
Due to over-enrollment last pring, the Cashier's office failed to document the 
registration of all UCSD undergrads prior to the AS. election. Therefore , a 
second election was held to allow ALL students to vote. ThiS year, however, the 
AsSOCiated tudents has taken care to rectify thiS problem bychangingel~ctlon 
regulations to allow for alternative forms of verifIcauon of enrollment. 

Howard recommends holding the elections as late as fourth or fifth week of 
Spring quarter Clearly, thiS is unnecessary and will only serve to discourage 
students from runnIng for office for academic reasons. 

4) The A.S. Council has proven its resolve to uphold student refere nda.Just in 
the past year. the A.5. has upheld student initiative by enacting legislation on 
the followmg referenda issues: South Africa and divestment, funding for 
alternative media, promotion of a UCSD parking shuttle , and greater atrention 
to UCSD athletics. 

The AS. Council has limited authoriry with respect to enforcement of certain 
referenda results; many decisIOns are enmely made by the Admi nistration. 
However, the A.S. will not hesita te to demand that the student voice be heard. 
5) The A.S. has consistently held a policy which bases funding appropriations 
on principles of fairness and equal opportunity. These principles are in 
corporated with conSideration of an appropriation's benefit to the student body 
and the requestor's demonstrated need and fiscal responsibility. 

Howard assens that the Commmee for World Democracy received "a 
politically-motivated budget cut," when in fact, they received an increase of 
$1123. 

We respeCt the right of students to hold a constitutional convention. 
Howeve r, the current system works well, and in fact, we have spenta significam 
portion of our term in office on Its Improvement. We have revised Election and 
Financial By-laws, as well as expanded current programs and offices in areas 
such as Exte rnal Affairs , Programming, Academic Affairs, and seIVices such as 
the Grove Caffe, Volunteer Connection , Lecture otes, etc. 

We support Increased stability 10 the current Constitutional system in order 
that we may more effectively represent a ll of the diverse students of UCSD. We 
do not see a new constitution , asAndy Ho\vard advocates, as the answe r to the 
alleged problems. Rather, we ask for even greater student involvement and 
participa tion.

Made in Italy, 
Taking it all in with an espresso 
By KAREN KUMM, Staff Wnrer 

A LBERTO Volpato des ribes himself as handsome. incomparably 
smart and r<1dlcally nice; a real 
example of an Italian 'wild male.'

he IS studying ('(onoml s, 
pohtl -al 5 ience and hIstory He 
has notlced many differences 
berwcen the two school system . 
I n Italy, class attendance is often 
not mandalOl)' and the students 
have more flexibility with the 
planning of their studIes and 
exammations. The university 
degree is somewhere between a 
bachelors and a masters. Be ause 
of thIS, most students do nOl 
need to go on to graduate 
sc hool. Certain fields , like 
medicine, require specialized 
training after a university 
edu auon 

The UniversIty of Padova IS 
scanered throughout the city, 
there IS no unified campus 
Some of the school hUlldings are 
huge old pala cs. Most of rhe 
students In Ital}' commute to

studem~ @f !lei a ill to study 
and work at the sarpe time. "In 
Italy, most of the people Just 
study. school only costs about 
'S200 a year," he said. The 
Universities are government 

funded . USll1g his 'personal' 
Enghsh, Albeno descnbes thc 
ltahan govcmment as 
'asSlstenuahsr' meaning th at morc 
programs, such as health are, 
are funded than In Ih e Unrted

"There are good and dMk

gO\'cmmcl1l IS a five -pany

domll1afjt Amerj an polin al 
pani!:S as fairly similar. In 
compa'rison, the It'\lian Prime 
MinIster is SOCialist, and the 
largest party in the coaijtion is' 
the Cl}ristian Democrat£. Alberto 
believes that in Ital}', ".a., strong 
cel}tral govemm~m <_ sacrifi~ed 
for the co flicdng needs oi'this 
heterogeneOifs society." I 

The politicaL groups1 n Italy 
range from corl\m1.lnists to 
extreme rightists. 'Even very 
small pOlities are1determinant 
when decisions are made ,"

used to .

Albcno Said he had to become

enough time to do eWf)Tthmg. 

In Italv, a kISS on the cheek IS 
as com~on place as a 
handshake is in the United 
States. A kISS on the cheek herc 
usually has a specii;ll meaning 
at[<lched to it, but Alberto admIts 
to taking advantage of the Italian 
cus\om. F'\:! what he has 
observed , it 'a t'efns that 
"Italian men are more chivalrous 
more likely to bring flowers for; 
girl." The Italian image of 
American girls resembles that of 
the music video "Cali lamia Girls" 
by DaVId Lee Roth . "I was 
expecting to see a 101 of girls 
with blond hair, blue eyes and 
big, big ... smiles," he said. 

Albeno has noticed the 
problems which arise from being 
without a car. "I can't mvite girls 
to come out with me on my bike 
because I don't even have one. 
But usually my girls havc 
powerful convenibles." 

Alberto says thar sometimes he 
still misses bemg In the cafes 
and shoppmg squares of Italy 
with his good fnends. The social 
scene whIch he's u ~d to is velY 
different than that whIch exists

Continued from page 7 
the San Diego 'show, but The 
Beastie Boys were not in 
agreement. "That's bullshit [the 
removal of Murphy's Law from 
the ticket]' they're on this tour 
with us and you can't fucking do 
that," King Ad-Rock of The 
Beastie Boys said. 

Stack did nOl consider the 
opening band an issue. "It would 
make no difference if Murphy's 
Law wasn't there ." 

Although the Beastie Boys 
were disappointed with the 
cancellatlon, San Diego was only 
one stop on their 35 city, two 
month tour. "It 's just too bad. It 
was sold out. It probably would 
have been a good show. I mean, 
it wasn 't like devastating. None 
of us broke down and cried . It 's 
toO bad. There's 3,000 people 
who bought llckets or whatever 
and they're not going to get to 
see the show," King Ad-Rock 
remarked . 

The management was more 
outsp ken about the cancellation, 
"We're appalled and we're pIssed 
off. " Adler said, "UCSD is the 
onl y date on the tour ro react [to 
the group's reputationlln this

In the US. He finds the Southern 
Califomian philosophy of life to 
be based on the indiVidual; 
whereas in Italy, frIendship and 
family seem to be more 
important. In comparing friend 
from UCSD to the ones in Italy, 
Alberto finds that Italians seem 
more friendly. Beyond the 
"what's up dude?" and "how's it 
going, man?", Alberto said that 
"there are a lot of velY nice 
exceptions to the Southem 
Californian stereotypes." 

Italy is popular tor ItS [jne 
foods and high fashions. Albeno 
admits that he has noticed more 
overweight people here than in 
his homeland. "Our lood seems 
Simpler, healthier, with not so 
many sauces," he said. Mario's 
Pizza at La Jolla Village Square 
has the pizza closet to authentic 
that he has found , yet he 
acknowledges that "the crust is 
really thin."

A DAY IN THE UFE OF ALBERTO VOLPATO 
Alberto , after experiencing the pany life of the Third College 

Apaltments during the first quarter, "from where you can go to 
c1ass"in thr~,e minutes still wearing your rajamas," is now living 
In a lUXUf)r condo off campus. A typlca day [or Alberto is as 
follows: "Well , of course, I wake up. Then I eat a huge breakfast 
(l pig out) and rhen campus. A long nap in the afternoon -my 
beloved siesta- sometimes I sleep on the beach. Sometime ' I do 
reading (only a few minutes for thIS) and then out with friends 
to parties, night clubs (l love the Elephant Bar), and before 
gomg t bed I Jump for the auna or thc swimming pool ; from 
It to the jacuzzi and vice versa." Ia:I 

heavier than that provided at 
past on-campus concerts, 
according to Lt. Jay Dyer of rhe 
UCSD Police Depanment. 

"We're going to have the same 
kind of set up," Dyer said, 
"There would be two officers in 
addition to what we normally 
have on duty. No C50s were 
specifically requested to work the 
concen, 

"I had heard there was trouble 
at the last event, so I was happy 
the university was made aware of 
the problem. We don't want that 
kind of trouble." 

At this point, no legal action 
has been taken by The Beastie 
Boys, their management or 
Southland Concerts to attempt to 
recover lost income from the 
cancelled show. 

"Through good faith, we have 
presented to Linda Stack an 
estimate of out-of-the-pocket 

expenses, advertiSing, radio 
spots, and a list of expenses that 
would have come [rom the show 
if it had happened. They lUEO] 
are going through them now, 
and hopefully, we will arrive at a 
settlement. If not, unfortunately, 
I'll have to turn it over to my 
legal advisor," Peterson of 
Southland Concens said . 

Stack confirmed "no charges 
have been pressed" and UEO is 
working out some deal. 

"We play fucking rock and roll 
and there is bound to be some 
mayhem; there always is ... but it 
always works out in the end ," 
King Ad-Rock said . 

The Beastie Boys have 
tentatively planned another tour 
this summer, although UCSD wiU 
probably not be considered as a 
location for the San Diego 
concen, according to King Ad-
Rock. Ia:I

date, "and perhaps we are more 
trendy," Alberto said . "Clothes 
are very important to Italians, 
perhaps this is why Italy is the 
fashion capital of the world ." 
Italian young people imirate 
Americans in some aspects. "We 
have been invaded by T,shirts 
with American sayings on them." 

After fashion and food , 
vacations are also important to 
Italians. The most popular spots 
to relax in are Spam , Greece anu 
Yugoslavia , as well as on all 
ltalLan beache<; Italy is a 
pemnsula , so the coastline is 
cxtcn i\'e The closest mountainS 
to Padova arc the Alps. The 
Untted States is a desireable 
vacauon spot as well, "but the 
airfare is toO expensive," Albeno 
said. 

Albeno plans to do some 
traveling in the United States 
next summer and retum to Italy 
in August. His impression so far 
of America is that "it's great. 
Everything is so much bigger 
than in Italy." His dream since 
high school had been to study 
abroad, especially in Califomia. 
This state, for him as for many 
Europeans, is a sort of exotic 
paradise, "a land of fruits and 
nuts," Alberto joked. 

Alberto found the Intemational 
Center at UCSD to be velY 
helpful. His homeland of Padova 
is the location of the biggest UC 
center in Italy. Students on 
exchange use the center for help 
with hOUSing, classes, and any 
(ltller problems that may arise 
during their year abroad. 

Albeno was more than pleased 
to be interviewed and joked that 
he has "booked an airplane to l1y 
1,000 copIes of The Guardian 
over to Italy." [CJ

~~T!~~~",,,out the old ways de line, retrea ting before an onslaught of electromc gadge t . 
Arnold , one of the fi r t faculty 

members recruited for UCSD, said 
tha t dunng the transltlon period, 
when a large proportion of 
students st ill used shde rules, th ere 
was an a rgument that the then -
high price f calculators favored 
"rich kids" 

F I FrEEN years ago, the primary calculating tOol of the UCSD student 
was the sliderule. A decent ten 

inch "slip stick" was accura te to 
three decimal places, givmg you 
logs, powers, tngonometric 
functions, and their inverses. 

Having been aroupd SIn e 1632 
slide rules have been an Integral' 
pan of mathematical progress. 

Today, however. sliderule 
manuals are kept , for the most 
pan in most of UCSD's libraries 
or at the bottOm of people's de k 
drawers.

Triton men breeze past Menlo 
UCSD uses its inside.game in 92-70 victory over Oaks 
By KURT BEll 

O N THE DAY Dennis Con nor brought the cup back. San Diegans were 
sn ll beating up on the Aussies. 
The Triton hoopsters blew the 
Menlo Oaks and their Australian 
ce nter Darytn Shaw right out of 
the water. 

The Tritons came out slow, 
giving the Oaks the lead for the 
first 12 mmutes of play, but 
gamed full control of the helm 
en route to a 92-70 wm, their 
11 th m 12 games. 

"We starred out reaUy sluggish 
in the first half," admitted UC D 
head coach Tom MarshaU, "but 
our defense was really strong and 
that kept us in the game ." 

The game was unusual for the 
Tritons in that they were forced 
to give up theIr usual penmeter 
barrage , due to oUlSlde pressure 
from Menlo guards. 

"Our inside men did a 
spectacular job tonight," MarshaU 
said comple menting the play of 
Steve Dabasinkas and Andy 
Jedynak, rebound leaders with 
six apiece. 

"Personally, I didn't do too hOI 
because they denied us the 
outside shOl." said Kamansky. 
"The other guys did really well , 
though ." 

An off-night (or one of the 

"Our inside man did a spectacular job 
tonight. There wasn't anyone who didn't 
p lay we ll. "

Marshall also gave hIgh praise 

to the entire bench , "There 
.\O,'llsn't anyone who dldn 't play 
well tonight." 

Senior guard G reg Kamansky. 
though. disagreed with Marshall's 
assessment. being somewhat 
skeptical of his own 
performance. 

team's leading scorers is quite 
understandable when, with 4:27 
remaining in the first half, 
Kamansky was dropp d to the 
floor as his face merged with a 
Menlo player's shoulder during a 

fast break . Although he was 
down for several minutes and 
suffered a cut on his lip that 
required slIIches, he did return 
to acti on. After the game, he 
obviously appeared quite d azed. 

Backens led Triton scores with 
16, John Saintignon had 15 and 
Jedynak 12. Shaw led the Oaks 
with 18 p oints and six 
rebounds. 

The Tritons are precariously 
close to a !Wenry win season with a 
19-6 record . and need to 'vi n their 
last twO games to get a dt!cent shot 
at the DI\~sion III playoffs. 

UCSD's next encounter is 
against Division III rival Pomona-
Pitzer, Wednesday at 8 pm m

By BRIAN now, Staff Wncer

coax thei r team to VI tory 

Chams of "UCSD' and "Let's 
go '1 ritons," along with short 
breaths 01 wild cheering at some 
very eXClllng play, almost enticed 
the Tntons to an upset VICtOry 
over the Matadors. 1111, the 

viSitors from Nonhridge were 
able to overcome a 2-1 defiCit to 
defeat UCSD 3-2 In the season's 
mo t excltl ng match 

The Matadors seemed more 
than worthy of their high 
natIonal ranking as they 
overcame an early Triton lead to 
take the first game by a score of 
15-10 

But In the second game, It was 
the Tntons who looked hke a 
national power as they ran off 
the game's fir t seven pomts 
Blocking and dIgging each 
Matador anack, they cumrnlled 
the game en route to a 15-M

The ma tch's third game was 
again controlled by th e Tncon 
spikers Rallying from an 11 -10 
dellci t. UCSD scored the fmal 
five pOints and took a 2-1 lead 
in the match. 

But the hopes of a Triton 
upset were then dealt a slUnning 
blow CSU ~orthndge Insened a 
number of bIgger blockers and 
forced UCSD to fall VictIm to the 
memallapses that plagued them 
in their loss to Loyola a week

A beer with Bird-BJ.'s Chicago Pizzeria Sports Quiz 

Spon Magazine has changed its interview format. Now they have a 
column called "Beers with ... ," in which they conduct the interview in 
an informal setting. Judging by their first piece. it's a rousing success. 
Here are a couple of candid quotes from Larry Bird , their first subject. 

On playing against Julius Erving: "I 'lIsed to get myself so psyched 
to come in here (Philadelphia ) ... I'd pace myself for three or four 
games JUSt to get ready for him . But it's Just not there anymore. Not 
just because he changed positions. He just doesn't have it anymore . I 
really miss it." 

On Ralph Sampson: "I don't know what Ralph 's problem is. If 
Ralph would just play up to half of his abiliry ... Jesus Chnst! 

On Kareen Abdul Jabaa r: "Kareem's gotta be the greatest athlete 
who ever lived . You JUSt gotta roll out the red carpet for him. How 
the hell can you do that (Play at 40 years old)?" 
The commitment of new Padre manager Larry Bowa has certainly paid 
off. After the 1985 season, the Mets oITered him $250,000 to play. He 
wanted to manage , however, so he accepted ajob with the Las Vegas Stars 
for just $28,000 a year. '

defense, points and s ideouts 
were exchanged as the Matadors 
took a 4-3 advantage. Then, the 
big blockers of Northridge paid 
off again as the visitors ran off 
seven straight pOints, silencing 
the crowd and eventually 
winning the final game 15-7. 

CSU Nonhridge coach John 
Price attested his team's victory 
to "a combination of blocks and 

my players' ability to affect Jhe 
(Triton) hitters." This analysis of 
the night's match was quite 
accurate . On this occasion, 
UCSD was just outmatched by a 
bigger team. 

The Tritons seem to be 
making a major stride in their 
attempt to compete with 
volleyball 's national powers. They 
are not as prone as they used to be 
to the mental lapses that plagued 
them ea rly in the season and arc 
jelling quite well as a team. 

Triton coach "Digger" Graybill 
commented after the game, 
"overall this is the best volleyball 
we've played this year. W~ are 
going to use it as a springboard 
to continue our movement up to 
the top 20." ~

UCSD wome31 too quick for Claremont 
By CHARLES T ABESH, Contributing Sports Editor 

like yesterday's BA aU-star 
game, fi nesse overcame power at 
th e main gym Saturday night. 
UCSD (14-9), the smaller, 
quicker team beat the Claremont 
Athenas 01-9), 61-44. But, 
unlike the all-star game, the 
outcome was never in doubt, as 
the Tritons controlled every 
phase of the contest. 

minutes that things would go the 
Tritons' way. 

Just about every time down the 
coun it seemed as though the 
Athenas were called for travelling. 
And when they weren't walking 
with the ball , they were throwmg 
it away. UCSD center Jill Coster 
made three steals within a 
minute and a half as Claremont 
was playing our of control. By 

halftime they had just eighteen 
points to the Tritons' 28. 

For some reason, the Tri to ns 
must have liked the way 
Claremont was playmg because 
they staned the second half with 
their best imi ta tion. Both teams 
were floundering arou nd the 
court until UC D regained their 
composure. 

Ragatz suddenly couldn't miss 

from outSide, fi nishing with a 
game high eighteen points. And 
Copeland kept pretend ing she 
was Moses Malone with so me 
tough moves down low. he had 
thirteen points Saturd ay night. 

The Tritons pulled away to a 
seventeen poi nt viCtory and 
Malone was happy with the 
performance. "W e played real 
good defense ." she sa id 

afterward . ·We took them OUt of 
their offense almost totally." 

And the Claremont coac hes 
came away Impressed wi th 
Ragatz and Copelantl , but still 
believed fa tigue was a factor. 
"We playecl'a tough game last 
n ight," W etzler sa id. "We we re 
lethargic. W e were n't 
determined ." 

"It was just kind of a total 
team effort," remarked Tnton 
coach Judy Malone after the 
game. Their aggressive man-to-
man defense forced two dozen 
turnovers from the Athenas, and 
they were able to push 
Claremont into a fast paced 
game. On offense, Tracy Rogatz 
was blazing from outside and 
Beth Copeland controlled the 
middle for UCSD. 

Tritons swept in doubleheader 

Before the game Shelly 
Wetzler, assistant coach of the 
Athenas , was worried about her 
team's physical condition . -We 
had a game last night. We're 
pretty dramed ," she explained . 

Claremont's strength going In 
was their size and outside 
shooting. "We're not very fast ," 
admitted Wetzler. They planned . 
therefore , to play at a slow tempo 
and set up their offense. 

But Malone obviously had 
other ideas. "We're a little 
qUicker. Hopefully that'll be a 
key," she said. And It was 
ObVlOUS after the fi rst few

T HE Triton softball team opened up their '87 season by losing a double-
header to the Cal Poly Mustangs, 
Saturday at the Jewish 
Community Center. Yet , the 
afternoon saw a wide variety of 
competitive softball that gave a 
promising outlook for the future 
of the TritOn women. 

In the firs! game, the young 
uc D squad displayed the 
character of an experienced team 
by almost overcoming a fourth 
inning 7 -run defIcit. Cal Poly 
came Out with a good show of 
offe nse III the first inning with 
three runs on three hits. 

But the Tritons remained calm 
and quickly set about giving the 
Mustangs a good banle. T J.

Bronson led off by drivi ng a 
double to right field . Kim 
Ostrowski followed with a 
sacrifice bunt tha t moved 
Bronson to third . Yet, all the 
TritOns were able to get out of 
the inning was o ne run as 
Bronson scored on an error. 

The Mustangs amassed four 
more runs in the next three 
innings with a total of six hits 
and one Triton error. 

In the bottom of the fourth , 
the Triton offense came alive 
\\~th an enthUSiastic effort to cut 
the Cal Poly lead . With two outS 
and two runners on, Debra 
Callabresi Si ngled to center 
scoring one. Bronson gO! on wi th 
a walk to load up the bases for 
Ostrowski who responded by 

sending the ball deep into left 
field fo r a grand-slam home run . 

This b rought UCSD within 
one run of Cal Poly with a score 
of 7-6. But the game became 
defensive struggle from then on , 
as nei ther team produced more 
than one hit or was able to put 
any runner in scoring position . 
Cal Poly held on to win 7-6 . 

Game twO started out the way 
the first game left off. Tmon 
pitcher Julie Steiman allowed 
only two hi ts in six innings. But 
\vith her fatigue , she walked 
nine, combined with two key 
errors by the Triton infield , led 
to five Cal Poly runs in six 
innings. 

Musta ng pitcher K. Gorman 
effec tively shut out the UCSD 
bats for five innings by striking 

out three and allowing only two 
hits. The UCSD team was able to 
score one in the sixth with 
singles by C harissa Hammett, 
Patty Campbell and Debra 
Callabresi. The fi nal score was 
8-1. 

Coach Colleen Wight was 
relatively pleased on how her 
team matc hed up against the 
Division II Musta ngs. "For the 
ope nl'r with a roste r of seven 
fres hmen they showed character 
and played pretty da m well ," 
said WIght. "We are looki ng
