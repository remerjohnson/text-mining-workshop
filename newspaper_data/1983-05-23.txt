Clarifications on Reg Fee Budget 
Editor: 

In the arl icleconcerning Reg 
Fee's final budget recommen-
dations, there were se\'eral 
points brought up which I feel 
deserve clarification, The Reg 
Fee Committee, a student 
majority budgetary advisory 
grouP. has spent the past 
quarter a nd half re\' iewing the 
\'arious services funded by reg 
fees. Reg fees , by thc way, are 
the $170.00 everyone shells 
out each quarter along with 
t he res t of I he fees . \1Of;t 
"t udents are probably more 
concerned With the fmal 
tJulcomt' of rerel\ing Sf'rVlces

We are also paying three-
quarters of the cost for new

Anshen has gathered some 
of today' s greatest minds to 
address the problem s that 
professional scient ists see in 
the world , 

"There is moral atrophy, 
destructive radiation within 
us, as we watch the collapse of 
values hitherto cherished -
but now betrayed." wrote 
Anshcn in her introduction to 
Convergence in the Anatomy 
0/ Reality, 

Nuclear pro l iferation 
seemed to be one of Dr. alk's 
primal'}' concerns for the 
future of the human race, "We 
have to separate the scientific 
development from nuclear 
physics and the use to which it 
is put," said Dr. Salk. Jlewent 
on further to explain that , 
"Scientists make the nuclear 
weapons, but they have no 
voice in the decisions to use 

nuclear weapons." 
Dr. Salk sees evolution as

Robert's Rules resides 

Atmosphere at the new 
Council's meeting was mild 
com pared to the final 
lameduck essions of the 
former AS Council. New 
member s quietly passed 
around a Robert's Rules of 
Order paperback, learning the 
AS rules of procedure, "at a 
glance," while motions were 
carried out by those members 
who held a better understand, 
ing of pari iament ary language, 

Not only could Robert 's 
Rules pose obstacle for some 
new members, but the 
innumerable abbreviations of 
variou student organizations 
and committees may also 
disable potentially strong 
debators If not mastered

and 2..t percent are female. 

The applied and pure 
science areas are the worst 
with o nly three percent and 
six percent of tenured 
profcssors who are women In 
those respective areas. Even in 
the social sciences, behavioral 
sc iences, and humanities, 
where there is a majority of 
female students, the number 
of tenured female facuIt y 
mem bers IS less than 20 
percent. 

On the staff of UCSD, wide 
differences between the sexes 
also exist. Most obvious is the 
disparity between the total 
percentage of women 
employed by the Uni\'ersity 
versus the percentage of 
women in t he powerful 
executive, administrative, and 
managerial positions, Overall, 
68 percent of all career staff 
po itions are filled by women, 
while only 38 percent of the 
executive, admtnistrative, and 
managerial positions are held 
by women. 

The Widest diffcrence~ 
between the sex('s ar(' found in 
the secr('la rial 'derical and the 
"killed crafts categories. As 
expected, 90 percent of Ihe 
~ecret arial clerical workers 
are women and only fl\e 
percent of the skilled craft 
positions are women . 
Considenng that clerical 
~ecretarial jobs are usuall~ 
luw·paying pOSItIOn s II itl!

thiS dlustrates the bleak 
employment picture for 
women In those areas.

Difficulties for Women 
S taffers 

ex ual discriminatton has 
certainly played a role in the 
sma ll number of female 
profcssors, but more than 
that , the fact exis ts that there 
are sim ply a smaller n,umber of 
female Ph .Ds WIth the 
qualifications to teach at 
universities , This, again, is 
routed in our whole socializa· 
tion process and in the 
disparity bet ween areas that 
are considered proper for 
females to study and those 
areas which are deemed male· 
oriented , 

Anot her factor ,\ hich makes 
it difficult for universities to 
secure qualified females to 
teach is business policies 
which lure these women to 
work in private industry. 
Many businesses also have 
federal affirmative action 
plans they must adhere to, and 
the monetary gain for 
individuals is much greater in 
private Industry, e~pecially in 
hard science areas, compared 
to work in academia. 
The Plan 

For the staff at CCSD, the 
affirmatl\'e action plan 
consIsts of "etting upgoals and 
targets to f'ncouragc women 
and mlnortlCs who arc 
" underutillzed" in job 
categories. Educating supcr-
\isors about the goals and 
reasons behind affirmatiw 
action is also pract iced. 

The complexity of affirma· 
tlve action stems from the 
trouble in defining exactly 
who are the "underuti li zed" 
group and how underutiltzed

For those Council members 
that did not know what the

Enlightening Journey 
l'ontinucd front page 3 
You don't even get your 
fingernails dirty . If you have 
the time and equipment 
bicycling is almost unbeatable. 

LastlY, takeas much cash as 
you can possibly afford and, by 
all means, familiarize yourself 
with the process of wiring 
money by way of Western 
Union. Maps and trayel books 
are free to AAA members, If 
you're not a member, nodoubt 
famlh' or fnends are. Get 
every'thing you can lay you r 

hand~ on. 
After you arrive in the 

vicinity of your chOICe, a\'oid 
the chai n restaurant and ga 
stations like the plague. Find a 
local cheap·gas joint and ask 
the attendant to recommend a 
good place to eat. Out 'ide 
California, these people are 
actually friendly and, if you 
come acro ' Iow·key, they will 
almo t alwa ys be willing to 
help you out. Once you reach 
Aunt Bess' Grill, the food will 
be better and cheaper than 
Denny's and the atmosphere 
will be, well, "less generic." 

This all sounds like common 
sense, but bear in mind that, 
after a long day on the road, 
it's easy to fall in the rut of 
seeking out that famihar sign 
and dealing with the same 
brand of surly waitress that 
you'd find in darkest LA. 

The locals can al 0 provide 
data that no travel book cou ld 
possibly contain. The hot 
fishing spot~, for example, or a 
scenic back road that will get 
you awav from the holtday 
traffIC,' People are an 
Invaluable re,;ource when 

you're a thousand miles from 
horne, Keep an open mind, 
forget that you're a hot·~hit 
California college sl udent, and 
by all means stay calm, 

Get ting lost can bring oUI 
the worst in anybody, but it 
can ultimately provide a 
highlight of the \acation. 
Wllen I've gotten lost (more 
frequently that I ca re to 
admit), I've "discovered," 
some hot springs on the side of 
a dirt road, an old coa l mine, 
the world's first nuclear 
reactor (a spooky place buried 
in the middle of Idaho), the 
world's largest landslide (hell 
of a s tory, but space 
prevents ... etc.), a honeycomb 
of volcanic caves, and, in fact. 
a great many things that 
rivaled the spo t I had 
originally attempted to reach. I 
know some people who even 
travel without maps, but this 
is valid only for an experienced 
traveller who is familiar with 
the basic la yout of the area. 

It is shocking to discover 
how big Ihe USA really i . Not 
merely in square miles tallied 
up in an atlas, but tn terms of 
its mind ·bending vastnes . A 
sunset in the rearview mirror 
can bring tears to your eyes, 
and the road disappearing into 
Ihe darkness ahead will 
quicken your pulse. 

When you finally do get to 
Europe, or the Orient, or 
wherever you want to go, 
you'll have a firm point of 
reference. And when someone 
asks "what's Amenca r{'(/lIv 
like?" vou'll know. If you 
haven't -seen it,) ou won't have 
the slightest Idea .

There is a Difference Between Sexes 
('olltinlled frolll pa).(l' ,I 
they are, ExtenSIve research 
goes intu determining the 
percenlage of avai lable 
qualified individua ls for 
various job classi ficalions 
compared to the percentages of 
women and minorities who 
actually hold those jobs. This 
is done on both the staff and 
academic hiring levels. 

The process of recruiting 
qualified individuals from the 
underutilized groups to fill 
posit ions as t hey open up is 
s low and not easily accom· 
plished. 

Beyond affirmative acl ion 
programs, cha nge must occur 
in attitudes and conditioning 
that adversely deter women 
from higher level adminstra· 
tive and managerial positions. 

First, many women do not 
develop their math and 
analytical s kills to the same 
extent that men do. This 
stems from females not being 
encouraged to take math, 
along with the outdated notion 
that females are not good at 
math. Studies have shown 
that women still face "math 
anxiety" when they reach 
high school and college, 
Developing the 'e math and 
analytical kills is often 
necessary to deal with 
complex managerial issues. 

Second, women do not deve· 
lop a " .eam mentality" as 
much as men do, because of 
less participation in formal 
and informal sports. Having 
this "team mentality" and the 
abIlity to disregard personal 
differences in the workplace 

ha s been proven to be 
important for the good of a n 
organization. 

The last drawback to 
progress for women is trust. In 
administrative and academic 
departmenl s people with the 
same belief ' and characteris, 
tics tend to grou p together. It 
is easier to be comfortable and 
to trust someone in a position 
of power if he has a similar set 
of experiences. Women 
moving into previously male· 
dominated administrative 
posit ion s are challenging the 
status quo, On a subtle, and 
probably subconscious level, 
this is one barrier women face. 
Sexual Harassmen t Hold 

Sexual harassment is one 
problem that mainly women 
must face in the work world. 

Two years ago, a campu ad 
hoc committee on sexual 
harassment was formed based 
on a new federal regu lation 
against sexual harassment 
and a greater awareness of the 
problem, The committee found 
that the problem was more-
pervasive Ihan they thought, 
that it occurred in implicit and 
explicit ways, and that the 
vulnerable posilion of women 
makes them reluctant to 
complain. 

Mary Wal schoc, dean of 
University Extension, and 
chair of the commi t tee stated 
that sexual hara~sment is a 
"power Issue. "It is found most 
often in s ituations where the 
male has a higher position over 
th e female, and whcre Ihere is 
frequenl contact, such as 

admints trator and secrclary or 
a professor and a female 
graduate student. She said 
t hat threats can be made, 
including the loss of a job or 
the flunking of oral examina· 
tions if ad\'ances by lh e 
harasser are rebuked. 

A number of steps were 
taken to deal with sexual 
harassment at UCSD as a 
result of the ad hoc 
committee 's recommenda · 
tions. An explicit statement 
was issued by top administra · 
tors which acknowledged that 
sexual hara smenl exists and 
that this behavior i ' 
unacceptable . Also a more 
clearly defined grievance 
procedure was put into effect, 
while students, facullY and 
staff were made aware thaI 
this system is avai lable. 

Additionally, to counteract 
the problem, Walshoc said, 
"Women must develop 
personal style and confidence 
Lo deal with sexual harass· 
ment," and they must not be 
timid about standing up for 
their rights. 

Change is taking place , 
although at a slow pace. One 
key step towards remedying 
the inequity between the sexes 
that exist in our society and at 
UCSD is an awareness of the 
problem . Whether students, 
staff , and faculty are being 
s ufficiently educated about 
the problems of inequity in the 
c lassroom and in the 
workplace is que'itionable. To 
promote much needed change, 
these Issues must continua ll y 
be addressed.

Golfers Finish 15th 
In Div. III Tourney 

By W. J OHN SCHACHT 
Staff Writer 

Pennsylvania' Allegheny 
College may not have a 
powerhouse football team. but 
Judging by last week's NCAA 
Division III Championship 
tournament in wonderfu l 
Wooster, Ohio, it does have a 
pretty good golf team. An 
incredible fina l round 297 gave 
Allegheny a two troke victory 
over defending champion 
Ramapo College. Allegheny 
finished with a four round 
total of 1229 to Ramapo's 1231. 
UCSD's Tritons fini shed with 
a 1269 total. giving them 15th 
place in the 19 · team 
tournament. However, on ly a 
near hurricane during the 
third round kept UCSD from 
finishing considerably higher. 

Ideally , golf \,:ould be played 
under blue skies and mild 
conditions. When It isn't -
and it wasn't - even the best 
golfers uffer. During the 
inclement third round, the 
golfers were subjected to a 
dn\'tng ratnstorm, high winds, 
and 45 degree temperatures. 
The weather had an 
immediate effect on the 
Tri tons' play (with Ihe notable 
exception of that of Bruce 

akamura) as the Tritons 
collectively "hot 13 strokes 
hIgher than they dId In an} 
other round. 

Individuallv. ,akamura 
finished eighth out of 120 
~olfers (he had finished fifth in 
81 and 20th in '82) and made 

second team AII·American, the 
thIrd year in a row Nakamura 
has made the AII ·America 
team . "Bruce de"er\'e~ a lot of 
credit," "aId hi~ coach, MIke 
Wydra. "Being named All· 
Amencan IS an honor in Itself, 
but he's got a chance next year 
to be named for the fourth 
time. and that desen'cs a lot of 
recognitIOn." ~akamura 's 
thIrd round 79 was one of the 
best dUrIng the storm. 
"Considering the conditIOns, 
he played as good a round as 

you can," sa Id Wydra. 
Nakamura finished with a 
four round total of 307,ju t ten 
trokes behind the leader and 

five behind the . econd place 
finisher. 

Un fortunately for the 
Tritons . the team's ot her 
golfers did not fair as well 
during the tourney. Freshman 
Ben Sweeney, the Tritons 
most consistent golfer during 
the year, shot a di appointing 
331, including a 91 during the 
storm. "Ben was ocold hehad 
trouble holding on to his clubs 
that day. He ended up taking a 
handi·wipe from a ball cleaner 
and wrapping it around the 
club just so he could hold on." 
said Wydra. The coach was 
pleased with the showing of, 
Mike O'Laughlin, whose :3 18 
total put him in the top 40. 
Senior Paul Dominguez shot a 
323 in his last tournament asa 
Triton, while Ian Langdon 
rounded out the lrCSD effort 
with a 333. 

During the tournament, the 
Tritons held true to a pattern 
they had developed through· 
out the year. "The back nine

"whIch IS \\ hat we had been

tougher the cour~e, the better

Although Wydra was 
"ext rcmcl)- pleased" WIth this

exctted about next \'ear's 
prospects. "We're onl~' 'Iosing 
one player, and we have two 
scratch players, Including a 
CIF champ, who are 
transferring in next fall. I'm 
lookIng forward to an e\ln 
bettcr vear." Wit h We~)s1er 
behInd t hClll, the TrItons are 
indeed lexlkIng ahead to an 
even rosier future.

OTL a San Diego Sumnler Event 
l'ontintll'd from l>a~l' 15 
year more than 20,000 people a 
day crowded Fie~ta Island to 

witnes~ the four·day World 
ChampionshIps . Berndes 
explains the popularIty, 
saying, " There is -good. 
weather. There are a lot of 
teams. Rut just as important, 
bathing suits are get l ing 
smaller out there every year. I 
never noticed it but somebody 
told me." -

In addltlun to the OTL 
tournament Itself, a ~ltss 
Emmerson contest 1:-' held to 
crown the \\'oman who best 

repre~ents both OTL and the 
beauty of San DIego (whate\'er 
that means). 

But this IS nut the only 

tournament of the year There 
are R;j tourneys in all. and 
whIle an Diego remains the 

.hotbed of OTL, the game has 
made its way Into places Ii ke 
Virginia Utah. and San Felipe, 
Mexico as \vell as theotherend 
of Southern California (Santa 
Barbara. Ventura, etc. ). Even 
Prince George, Canada has 
managed to get its share of 
OTL dosage by holding a 
yearly tournament in the snow

Isn't so soft after all. 

With all of the froll( 
'iurrounding the World 
Championships, it is easy to

fervor of It all. This is serious 

bi~ to many. People like Lou 
Brock, Eddie Matlhew~, Lance

Running Thoughts 
By JEFF SAVAGE and MIKE GREENBERG 

St uH Wril"" 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE DEPT, It was called the Drug 
Store Prcakness this year. The even·odds favorite Sunnr's Halo 
was being treated with antibIotics to alleviate a skin condItion, 
and Desert Wine and Marfa needed a court order before they 
could run with the controversia l Lasix medication. Bringon the 
Irony of ironies. The Drug Store Preakness was won by Deputed 
Testamony and a trainer who uelieves in no medication at all . 
More irony: Billy Boniface, Desputed Testamony's trainer, spent 
a week trying to find a jockey for his horse. Name riders all over 
the country said t hey had other plans, which is just a polite way 
of saying, "Sorry pal, [don't want to ride a loser.· ' Nineteen year 
old, local no·name Don Miller wasoffercd the job. accepted it. and 
is glad he did . Boniface originally named the horse Disputed 
Testamony but it went into the books misspelled and stayed that 
way. So what happened to Sunny's Halo, the Kentucky Derby 
winner? He got bumped early, boxed out half way through, and 
flattened out and faded at the end. The druggies? Desert wtne 
was overtaken at the end by the winner and settled for second 
place. Marfa finished fourth. Regardless of which horse stands 
in the winner's circle, sandwiched between weeks of pre·race 
preparation and hype and post ·race hooplah is the most excit Ing 
two minutes in all of sports. 
NOT T O BE BELIEVED DEPT. The negativism of some 
people. Southern Illinois baseball Coach RIchard C. (Itchy)jones 
had just watched his team defeat a rIval team for the :;oot h win 
in his coaching career - a milestone for baseball coaches. Jones 
expressed his joy by saying, "What does ;:iOQ mean to me? It 
mean!> I've been here a long tIme, I guess. I probably 0\\ n the 
school record for I he most losses too. That 's the bad thing a bout 
longeVIty." 
WAIT A MINUTE DEPT. Is It reall~ Phill~ and LA. agaIn' In 
1980 the NBA championships saw rookll' Maglcjohn~on and the 
Lakers knock off the 76ers. Then,last year, Philly got a second 
chance but blew it again as the Lakers won It all for the second 
lIme in three years. Here we go agatn.l'hiladl'lphia O\\'ller Harold 
Katz wants a winner more than anythlllg. He accepted a 
guarant eed fi nancia I loss by trading for t he million dollar l\lose!--
to put in the mIddle. Can the Doctor finally wcar a nng? lan 
Coach Rill) l unningham shake the jinx? If the 76ers don't do It 
thIS year, the} never \\111. The Laker!-- are plaYIng theIr best hall 
of the year but t hey won't win It. For PhIladelphia the t hi rd tIme 
wIll mdeed be the charm. 
COULD IT BE DEPT. lJCSD IClia"st" are certaInI\, excited 
over the possible mascot change frorn tl Ie Triton to the Koala (59 
percent of the students who voted favored t he change). but don't 
go near the lJCSD coaches with the Issue. Intercollegiate coaches 
were finall) awarded a much·needed increase in salary this year 
from $1,900 to $6,500 per year. The total salary a llotment for the

This is a reminder to all who want to be considered 
for financial aid for 1983-84. The deadline to 
complete your financial aid file to be considered for 
aid for all three quarters of 1983-84 is June 1, 1983. 
YOU need to find out which documents are 
required for your file. Your Student Financial 
Services Office will determine if your file is 
complete, and it is YOUR responsibility to 
respond promptly to any request for documents or 
information from that office. If your file is 
completed after June 1, you will be considered for 
Winter and Spring quarter financial aid only. 
Depending on the availability of funds, late

The SFS staff strongly urges that you 
complete your file as soon as possible to be

the inevitable last minute rush . 

All students, except those who are from very 
economically disadvantaged backgrounds, will be 
packaged with a recommended Guaranteed

$1000-l300 for California residents and $4336
