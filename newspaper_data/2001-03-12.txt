Students gathered in the Price Center Plaza to gather 
support for the reinstatement of affirmative action 

Staff Writer 

Hundreds of'students who believe that the 
UC system· wrongly eliminated its affirmative 
action program rallied at the. Price Center 
Plaza Thursday in support of reinstating it. 

Students at the 52-33-28 Rally were 
alarmed at the decline in black students 
enrolling at UCSD. 

In 1997, the last year affirmative action was 
used in the admissions process, 64 black fresh-
men enrolled at UCSD. A year later, that total 
fell to 52. The drop continued, and 33 enrolled 
in 1999. In 2000, only 28 blacks enrolled at 

UCSD, marking an all-time low. Blacks now 
compose 1 percent of new enrollees at UCSD. 

"It's not a white problem, it's not a black 
problem," said student Denise Pacheco. "It's a 
people problem: 

In 1995, the regents passed resolution SP-
1, which banned consideration of race' and 
gender in the UC admissions process. SP-l 
also provided for an outreach program aimed 
at minorities.

and other opponents of SP-1 believe that rein-
stating affirmative action will provide a more 
accurate representation of minorities at

Stapled Condoms 
Given Out on 
Library Walk 
Group confused students 
and upsets Student Health 
By STEVE LEHTONEN 
Staff Writer 

Students from a Visual Arts 2 course hand-
ed out condoms punctured with staples on 
Library Walk last Wednesday as part of a per-
formance art project promoting abslincn c. 
The students ' actions caused discontent 
among those from Student Health Services. 

The small group of students handed OLit 
condoms on Library Walk around 3 p.m. 
Wednesday. Some of the condoms were found 
with messages attached reading, "Don 't be 
Stupid" or "No Glove, No Love: 

Other condoms were correctly attached to 
information from Student Health Services. An 
anonymous member of the visual arts group 
said that the condoms were attained from 
Student Health Services at various times 
throughout the week. 

A group of students was given the condoms 
and they returned to inform the group that the 
condoms were unusable. One of the students 
visited Student Health Services on the 
assumption that the art students were student 
health advocates. 

Sherrie Hendrickson, a nurse at Student 
Health Services, ca lled the police and went 
outside to speak with the group of students. In 
the meantime, the offended students pressured 
the visual arts group to leave. By the time the 
police arrived, the group had left. 

Harmony Rhoades, a Marshall sophomore, 
found the group offensive. 

uWe walked back to them and said, 'Do you 
guys know that these condoms are not usable?' 
They replied, 'Abstinence is the only safe sex.' 
We came back and told them that what they 
were doing was wrong and that people could get 
STDs if they use these condoms: Rhoades said. 

The visual arts students insisted that the 
staples were intentional. 

"I was totally surprised," Rhoades said.

Persian Club Holds 
INoRouz' Celebration 
Students at Price Center Ballrooms enjoyed 
traditional dances and a dance party 

A.S. President Ranked 
in USA Today Top 100 

By MAltYAil ~ 
Staff Writer . 

UCSD's Persian Club held a 
two-tiered celebration of the 
Persian New Year, "NoRouz", in 
the Price Center Ballrooms 
Saturday night. The evening con-
sisted of a cultural show, provid-
ing background history of the cel-
ebration, as well as a dance party 
afterward. 

The celebration was put 
together in conjunction with the 
Persian Cultural Center of San 
Diego, which has been a support-
er of the Persian Club since its 

'I, 

inception. A.S. Council funding 
also made the event possible. 

Sam Borghei and Ramin 
Tabatabai, co-presidents of the 
UCSD Persian Club, wanted to 
create an event that would unite 
Persians from all over Southern 
California, not just UCSD stu-
dents. 

"We wanted to do something 
that would involve a lot of So-Cal 
Persians who would not usually 
celebrate the holiday, those who 
are detached from the culture," 
Borghei said.

Condoms: 
Students mistaken for 
Student Health Advocates 
Continued from .,.,. 1 
"They're misleading people. I'm total-
ly upset." 

Stephanie Medina was also present 
at the table and echoed Rhoades' words. 

"Their message was very unclear. 
They took a serious topic and mocked 
it," Medina said. 

It is unclear if the group was play-
ing the part of serious abstinence 
advocates or if they were genuinely 
concernt"d with the issues at 
hand. Visual am students defended 
their actions and claimed that their 
motives were less ambiguous. 

"The act of handing out stapled 
condoms was clearly and unmistak-
ably a demand to UCSO studen~s, and 
any other passers by, to address the 
serious gamble and threat that 
promiscuity poses," said visual arts 
student Adriana Barraza. "The con-
doms served as a tangible reminder of 
the uncertainty that comes hand-in-
hand with sex, be jt protected or not." 

Lupe Samaniego-Kraus, an educator 
at Student Health Services, was upset 
that the visual arts sllldents were being 
mistaken for student health advocates. 

"People trust the student health 
advocates," Samaniego-Kraus said . 
"We were worried that students would 
think these peoplt: were associated 
With Student Health: 

Hendrickson, ' who called the 
police, was also annoyed. 

"I was not pleased," Hendrickson 
said. ''I'm tine with people expressing 
their opinions, but when they attach 
my name, the name of Student Health 
Services, then I'm not all right with 
that. If it was a joke, it wasn't funny. 
Unwanted pregnancy is not funny." 

Barraza asked people to consider 
their message. 

"My response to the anger is that the 
encouragement of false truSt that is per-
petuated by the common act of passing 
out condoms is far more dangerous 
than the commentary on the risks of sex 
that these stlldcnts were making," Baraz 
said 

Workers at Student Health Services 
wer~ also upset that the visual ans 
group would destroy condoms that. are 
prOVided by Studcnt Health Services 
and paid tor by student registration fees 

The visual arts stlldents claimed 
that the destruction was necessary for 
the mt.'ssage to get across. 

Rally: 
Number of female UCSD 
famlty Iws dropped 
Continued from PIC. 1 
UCSO. 

"We need to have about five times 
as many of YOll here," Jorge Mariscal, a 
UCSO literature professor, said to the 
mostly nonwhite crowd of approxi-
mately 300. "The playing field is dra-
matically out of whack. 

"IStudents] are not getting a good 
education if they don't have people of 
color in the classroom." Mariscal said. 

Participants in the rally were also 
concerned with declining numbers of 
minorities and women in the UCSO 
faculty. SP-2, which also went into 
effect in 1997, prevents race and gen-
der from use as criteria for employ-
ment by the UC system. 

Before SP-2, 33 percent of UCSO's 
faculty was female, compared with 25 
percent of the faculty now. 

Mariscal said that Chicanos and 
blacks each make lip about one per-
ccnt of UCSO's faculty. 

UCSO typically accepts one-third 
of its applicants, and about a quarter of 
those admitted choose to attend. Last 
year, UCSD accepted 20 percent of 
blacks and 49 percent of Asian-
Americans who applied. Founeen per-
cent of accepted blacks enrolled. 

Whites composed 59 percent of 
UCSO's student population in 1990; 
today they are just 39 percent. Asian-

BRIEFLY 
Calcium Helps Nerve Cells Develop 

Biology researchers at UCSD have recently 
discovered that nerve cells in a fetus are direct-
ed throughout the body by intracellular calcium 
that acts as gophers between the embryo and 
the cells. 

The scientists published their findings in the 
March 9 issue of "Science," which describes 
how filopodia, which are projections from a 
nerve cell, test the outside environment and 
create calcium as is needed to serve as a 
transmitter for information between the organ-
ism's developing brain and other parts of its 
body. 

Timothy Gomez, an assistant professor of 
anatomy at the University of Wisconsin 
Medical School , led the research and 
explained that the calcium phenomenon may 
have previously gone undetected because of 
their minute size. 

The National Institute of Neurological 
Disorders and Stroke funded the team's 
research . 

The team used spinal nerve cells from frog 
embryos in their research, because they are eas-
ily multiplied and grow rapidly. 

UCSD to Present 17th Annual 
Film Festival Later This Month 

David G. McKendrick and Stephan Haggard, 
researchers at UCSD have written "From 
Silicon Valley to Singapore: Location and 
Competitive Advantage in the Hard Disk Drive 
Industry," with Richard Donor, a professor at 
Emory University. The book explores the domi-
nance of the United States in the global hard 
disk drive industry. 

In the book , the researchers present their 
findings as to why the United States has 
excelled in the industry, which has made the 
information age possible with the ever-growing 
use of the personal computer. They say that 
much of United States' success is due to 
effective globalization and 'the fact that they 
chose to research and develop the product in 
California, but to manufacture in Singapore, 
thus giving them an edge over Japanese com-
panies. . 

McKendrick is currently the research director 
of UCSD's Information Storage Industry Center 
and Haggard is currently acting as Interim Dean 
of' UCSD's Graduate School of International 
Relations and Pacific Studies.

Jacobs School Structural 
Engineers Survey Seattle 

Structural Engineers at UCSD's Jacobs 
School of Engineering will hold a free public sem-
inar March 12 to discuss their conclusions from 
a recent trip to Seattle, the site of a recent 
major earthquake. 

The team of engineers, which includes pro-
fessors Andre Filiatrault and Chia-Mlng Uang, 
looked at the damage done to buildings and 
bridges in the Puget Sound area. 

The quake measured 6.8 on the Richter 
scale, but damage remained limited because the 
earthquake was deep below the ground. The 
engineers found that structural damages were 

pr~valent even though earthquake retrofit pro-
cedures had worked successfully. 

Damages have reached $2 billion and accord-
ing to the Washington Emergency Management 
Division, there were over 400 injuries related to 
the Seattle earthquake. 

The seminar will take place at noon at 
UCSD's Center for Magnetic Recording 
Research auditorium, and the complete findings 
of the research group can be found online at

PINION 

Restricting religious groups from holding meetings after 
school infringes on First Amendment rights 
By ANDREW JEFFERY 
Staff Writer 

Less than a year after the Supreme Court 
ruled prayer before high sch091 footba ll 
games unconstitutional, the court is again 
looking at religion and 
public schools. 

The question on Feb. 
28 was whether religious 
groups, in this case the 
Good ews Club, a 
national Christian orga-
nization for kids, should 
be allowed to meet on 
public school property. 

Milford Central 
School in New York prevented the group 
from meeting on school grounds after 
school. stating "It's Sunday school on Tues-
day. We can't have that." The issue at hand 
is twofold, as it raises the question of free 
speech versus the separation of church and 
state. 

It IS important to note that allowing a 
group to meet in a classroom is different 
from cndorsing or promoting all of that 
group's views. It is unlikely that the educa-
tional system agrecs with the view the Boy 
Scouts of America have concerning gays, yet 
the Boy Scouts continues to meet at public 
schools thrClughb.unhe COuntry. ItfstCb.d. by • 

allowing the Boy Scouts and other groups to 
meet in classrooms, schools send the mes-
sage that for those students who wish to 
attend the meetings, there can be some 
moralistic value found in such organizations. 

Students need their parents' permission 
to attend a Good News 
Club meeting. This 
requirement acts as a 
safeguard against students 
having unwanted infor-
mation pushed on them. 
The Good News Club 
does not recruit in Mil-
ford ; it is simply seeking a 
convenient place to hold 
its meetings. 

Accodrng to an article from MSNBC, 
Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer stat-
ed that by preventing the group from meet-
ing at school, the district superintendent is 
"discriminating in free speech terms against 
religion ." 

Discrimination is something that rep-
utable groups and individuals use to deal 
with views or ideas that oppose their own. 
Milford may try to mask this discrimination 
with umbrella terms such as "protection" or 
"equality: but at the crux of the matter, this 
is a simple case of a school trying to sup-

Allowing religious groups to meet on school premises merges 
church and state, promising to open a large can of worms· 
By CASSANDRA PIERCE 
Senior Staff Writer 

A dispute between a local reverend and 
the school district in Milford, a town in 
upstate New York, has come to the 
Supreme Court. The case pits the First 
Amendment again'st the privacy and protec-

country. 

As the Florida recount case showed, the 
judges are far from being even-handed 
arbiters of the law. I must remember that 
they are all too human. 

That's what I am afraid of. 
Milford is so tiny that it has one school 

- a K-12 school - and the Rev. Stephen 
Fournier, whose church 
is a few miles down the 

based opinions are even more stubborn. If 
Great Deity Umlaut comes down and tells 
me that the moon is the size of a tennis ball 
and that the atmosphere magnifies it so we 
see it as though it's close to us, it's going to 
take quite a lot to change my mind. So 
some of the justices, despite what they see 
in the law and the state's ruling, are going 
to want to rule against the school district 
and some are going to want to rule against 
the reverend. 

Here you open up a can of worms bigger 
than the AP&M building. Forget about Mil-
ford, its dinky little school, Fournier and 
New York state. What we have here are a 
cl)urch leader (played by evangelical Chris-
tians and conservatives); a school premise 

(played by the govern-
ment of the United 

street, wants his branch 
of the national Good 
News Club to meet at 
this school. 

The school said that 
the group couldn't meet 
there. Fournier felt his 
First Amendment rights 
were being stepped on,

assorted angry organized 
religions). GUARDIAN OPINION 

so he tried again . The school again denied 
his request. The reverend took the case...'O 
court. 

The case itself seems very obvious to me. 
New York law states that school districts 
can adopt their own rules for use of their 
facilities. Milford School District includes 
this rule in its handbook: "School premises 
shall not be used by any individual or orga-
nization for religious purposes." 

In my opinion, the case is closed. The 
state of New York has the ball in its court. 
That's one of the many possible ways the 
U.S. Supreme Court can rule.

Handcuffs and Pornography: 'Cops' 
By SIMONE IANnNI 
Senior Staff Writer 

I don't watch TV very often 
but, like everybody else, I am 
occasionally guilty of zapping. 
During my zapping sessions, I 
happen to stumble upon an inor-
dinate number of shows based on 
the pursuit, arrest, trial and con-
viction of people guilty of this or 
that crime. I am not talking about 
the classic detective story, which 
(if it is a good one) has a well 
designed plot and in which, all in 
all, crime and punishment are sec-
ondary concepts. Think about a 
classic Agatha Christie detective 
stot)' in which, once the murderer 
has been discovered, his destiny" is 
never revealed. The murderer is 
interesting only as an intelligent 
adversary to be defeated using the 
rules set forth by Sir Arthur 
Conan Doyle: An investigation is 
essentially a chess game without 
moral undertones. 

No: [ am talking about shows 
with titles like "Cops." "Arrest and 
Trial." and so . on, in which the 
arrest and punishment of the per-
petrator is the only (or, at least, the 

- main) topic of interest. You must 
have .seen them, since they are 
almost everywhere. 

The networks are creating a 
new one every other Tuesday, 
cable channels love them, and 
even a supposedly sober station 
like the Discovery Channel man-
aged, somehow, to put a show 
evocatively called "The Prosecu-
tors" on the air - with the only 
justification, as far as [ can see, 
that the crime has indeed to be 
"discovered" before the perpetra-
tors can be captured. 

When I first noticed these 
shows, I went through a lot of my 
considerable supply of amazement. 
I found it rather hard to understand 

why any sane person would take 
the trouble of sitting through pro-
grams that, [ feel quite confident to 
claim, are impressively dull. Most of 
these shows are based on real life, 
which makes them unavoidably 
boring, since life imitates art only 
very imperfectly. A few of them are 
fictional but equally unpalatable 
since, in their case. art imitates very 
imperfectly that part of life that imi-
tates art very imperfectly. 

I finally came to a conclusion 
that explains quite satisfactorily the 
exorbitant number of such shows: 
They are part of a strong and bur-
geoning wave of conservative 
pornography. 

Some people might find this 
statement surprising and, possibly, 
think that, finally, senility got the 
best of me, since they are used to 
considering pornography as some-
thing related to the explicit and 
graphic depiction of sexual inter-
course. [n reality, pornography has 
very little to do with sex: What you 
know as pornography is simply the 
sad spectacle of frustrated male 
fantasies vicariously satisfied. 

From this point of view, "trial 
flicks" fit the pornographic pro-
file quite splendidly. They pro-
vide a fictional satisfaction to the 
frustrated conservative fantasies 
of a world in which the police are 
always infallible, gentle with the 
kids (except black kids, of 
course) and tough with the 
crooks, which are invariably 
nasty, ugly, stupid and will be 
inevitably hit by swift, hard and 
- above all - vengeful justice. 

Cop and trial shows satisfy these 
fantasies much in the same way 
that sexually explicit shows provide 
a fictional satisfaction to the male 
fantasy of having all women in the 
world available and constantly 
ready for immediate, casual sex. 

In this, as in other cases, one 

should make a distinction between 
pornography and erotism. Erotism 
is a subtle play whose subject is sex, 
but which requires a careful pacing 
and a delicate balance between 
explicitness and ambiguity, 
between seeing and guessing. 
While erotism requires a certain 
degree of frustration or, at least, 
postponement of sexual fantasies, 
pornography is always absolutely 
explicit, and the interludes between 
sexual actions are mere fillers (two 
hours of uninterrupted sexual 
action would be intolerably boring). 
[n pornography, the sex is always 
independent of a context, 'while in 
erotism the context is an important 
component of sexual excitement. 

This distinction is important 
to understand why trial shows 
are conservative pornography 
rather than conservative erotism: 
They share with pornography the 

~rivial explicitness and disregard 
for context. 

It is not essential to know why a 
perS\'n committed a certain crime, 
what is the background on which 
the crime took place, or other 
details like these; all that matters is 
that a guy committed some kind of 
crime and now he is being chased, 
stopped, detained, tried and con-
victed (there are no innocents 
unjustly accused on TV's trial 
shows: Much like a chaste virgin in 
a sex film , they would only spoil the 
fun). Just like in sexual pornogra-
phy, all the phases must be explicit 
and depicted in every detail. 

Conservative pornography and 
sexual fantasies do not have, how-
ever, the same moral sta tus. As 
tasteless as it may be, sexual 
pornography is based on sex, 
which is a thoroughly enjoyable 
and healthy activity. It is true that 
pornography is very demeaning to

New Top 10 List for 
Frosh and Transfers 
An updated list of must-do activities and 
must-see places for the newbies 
By JACOB WASSERMAN 
Staff Writer 

Caffeine now dam mit! Monday 
of 10th week always brings a surge 
in sales of coffee, Cliff Notes and 
crystal meth. Two more weeks and 
it's all over except for the crying 
and the academic petitions, but 
you've got to live th rough those 
1,209,600 seconds before you can 
look back on them. To help you 
spend them (and the 6,652,800 
seconds next quarter), here's a 

adviser who got fired for bClI1g too 
friendly, or the stoner/boozer buck-
ing the system/Matrix/resident 
security officers. 

3. Get smart - at professors ' 
office hours, discussing somcth ing 
real, not grades or what's going to 
be on the final. 

4. Get off campus - not to TGI 
Fridays or AMC La Jolla. Ride the 
34B bus all the way downtown and 
back. 

5. Get to know your campus, 
and the Revellers, Rooseveltians, 

Warrenites, Mar-review of the top 
10 th ings you 
absolutely must do 
at UCSD, and add 
10 more totally 
essential things 
you have to do by 
the end of the 
school year. 

These are for 
frosh and transfers 

Get a job - it's the 
only college-related 
experience that will 
actually prepare you 
for having a job, 

shallists and 
Muirons who live 
here. 

6. Get intro-
duced to the mem-
bers of the A.S. 
Council who repre-
sent you when they 
meet, Wednesdays 

who still have that new-to-the-
land-of-the-Sun-God smell, but 
many seasoned UCSD students 
need the remedial training, as well . 
So throw down your stimulant of 
choice (q uadruple espresso and 
slices of horseradish root on the 
side for me) and make sure you: 

1. Get sweaty - at R[MAC, a 
Tritons game, an intramural com-
petition, and playing wall ball at 
night in the Mandevilfe box behind 
the gallery. 

2. Get funky - at a party. And 
be sure to thank the host, whether 
it's those BOARD kids, a Greekf-
reak, the nutty nympho Darkstar 
role-playing garners, that resident 

at 6:30 p.m. in one 
of the Price Center ballrooms, to 
parcel out more than a million of 
our dollars from student fees. 

7. Get religious - sample the 
taster's platter of religious evt' llts 
offered to you. 

8. Get a job - it's the only col-
lege-related experience that will 
actually prepare you for hav ing a 
job. 

9. Get involved - try everything 
from the Greekfreaks to the Dark-
star Halloween Orgy planning 
committee, plus Amnesty Interna-
tional and other student organiza-
tions, KSDT (our own awesome 
workshop for radio skills) and Stu-

6 OPINION 

Pro: 
Value can be found in 
these religious meetings 
continued from page 4 
press views to which it does not 
wam its students exposed. Schools 
should encourage students to seek 
out many points of view instead of 
suppressing exposure to new ideas. 

Supreme Court justices must 
also struggle over what constitutes 
worship. Law prohibits school-
spons red religious worship of any 
kind. It also protects students who 
wish to worship, but requires that 
worship does not disrupt others or 
interfere with school activities. 

The age of ch ildren involved 
must be considered. Stories and 
songs may be considered worship 
when college students or even high 
school kids are involved, but does {\ 
6-year-old have the capacity to 
worship in the spirilUal sense of the 
word? They hear a story about 
someone helping someone else and 
sing a song to remember it. 

The hope is that children will 
remember the story well enough so 
that when faced with a situation in 
which they can either be thought-
ful or cruel, the right choice is 
made. 

In light of what has happened 
recently in Santee, Calif. and in 
OIher areas in the country, we 
should not be keepi ng such lessons 
from our children. Schools should 
actively support any group that 
tries to teach young people the dif-
ference between right and wrong. 

The largest issue in this case is 
deciding which takes precedence 
- free speech or the separation of 
church and state. Both are protect-
ed by the Constitution, but one 
cannot be used agai nst the other. 

Inste~d, in all instances where the 
twO conflict, d solution that 
upholds the principles of free 
speech whlk maintai ning the 

AND THE 
LIMITED 

important distinction between the 
government and religion . 

[f the school prevents the 
group from meeting, it violates the 
protection of free speech. Any pre-
vention of the meeting would be 
solely based on the views of the 
group and is discrimination based 
on a set of beliefs. The court must 
allow the Good News Club to 
meet, and any other religious 
group that wishes to meet. The 
school would be upholding the 
First Amendment while maintain-
ing the separation of church and 
state. Allowing any and all groups 
to meet shows no preference or 
support for a particular religion . 

The Good News Club group 
meets after school ends, so it does 
not in terfere with any school activ-
ity, and it simply teaches students 
the moral values that Christianity 
holds. Allowing religious groups to 
meet after school does not violate 
the Constitution and in fact pro-
motes positive moral instruction. 

Unfortunately, throughout the 
debates over rel igion in public 
schools, principle has superseded 
rea lity. The reality here is that a 
small group wants to teach young 
students how to be kind to each 
other. It teaches them about self-
lessness and generosity, and it hap-
pens to do it with Christianity at its 
core. Only those interested wiII 
attend the meetings, as those who 
do not agree or do not care are not 
affected in any way. 

[t is sad that such a simple yet 
important servi.:e to our children 
must be inconvenienced as a result 
of legal maneuvering and political 
and social activism. These religious 
groups do not aim to hurt anyone, 
and the fact that their values are 
anchored in faith is no reason to 
exclude them from one of the most 
importa nt and essential doctrines . 
of freedom. These groups should 
be allowed to meet at public 
schools and teach our children that 
there is virtue in kindness.

Claims of Being Unsafe Misplaced Porno: 
Trial shows are another 
perversion of pornography 

ferent from the rational realization 
(which we all share) that some peo-
ple, under certain ci rcumstances, 
should be put in jail. Lust for incar-
ceration is a thinly disguised lust for 
power and therefore much more 
immoral than the sexual fantasies on 
which sexual pornography is based. 

Editor: 
The writer of Thursday'S arti-

cle, "University Must Protect Stu-
dents from Racism," (March 12) 
writes that the Muir College 
Council, through Anti-Zionism 
Week, has made the Jewish com-
munity "feel unsafe on campus." 

Unsafe. Really. Does the writer 
really know what it is to feel 
unsafe? Being unsafe is having to 
go to sleep every night surround-
ed by sandbags, the pop-pop-pop-
ping of rubber bullets - an 
insane lullaby. Unsafety is fearing 
your death lurks around every 
corner dressed as an Israeli sol-
dier, an Israeli tank, an Israeli gun-
ship: death, hovering in the sky. 

That is feeling unsafe. Yet the 
writer writes that she feels unsafe 
and that this too is feeling unsafe. 
It is not a feeling of unsafety of 
person, but a moral and ideologi-
cal feeling of being unsafe. It is a 
feeling created by education, evi-
dence and facts that attack the 
belief that modern Israel is the ful -
fillment of a noble ideal, that it is 
a civilized oasis in a barbaric, 

. empty desert. 
This feeling of being unsafe, 

this questioning of the validity of 
~aving a homeland for one people 
at the expense of another, is and 
remains the goal of Anti-Zionism 
Week. Zionism is the political-
historical movement that created 
the modern nation of Israel and 
has subsequently led to the raping 
of the honor and dignity of the 
Palestinian people, of mothers and 
fathers, sons and daughters.

Letter Inaccurately 
Accu ... Gov. Davl. 
Editor, 

I am writing to correct a few of 
the inaccuracies in the letter from 
Lucas Simmons ("Letters to the 
Editor: March 8). Simmons lays 
the blame for the current energy 
crisis in California on Gov. Gray 
Davis. Actually, energy deregulation 
legisla tion was passed in 1996 
under the administration of 
Republican poster boy Pete Wilson, 

and the crisis has been caused by 
energy price manipulation by 
George W Bush's friends in big oil. 

[t is also interesting that Sim-
mons can claim that energy dereg-
ulation in Texas has been a success, 
when it is not due to be implement-
ed in that state until Jan . 1,2002. 

As to the idea of separation of 
church and state, in Jefferson's 
1802 letter to the Danbury Baptist 
Association, he argued that the 
Constitution created a "wall of sep-
aration between church and state." 

Although the exact phrase 
"separation of church and state" 
does not appear in ·the Constitu-
tion, this was Jefferson 's interpre-
tation of the First Amendment: 
"Congress shall make no law 
respecting an establishment of 
religion: [ am sure that Simmons' 
interpretation is much more in 
tune with the intentions of the 
framers of the Constitution than 
Jefferson 's, but [ mention Jeffer-
son's opinion here merely as 
interesting historical trivia. 

Maybe we have underestimated 
President Bush's credentials. As 
Simmons points out, Bush did 
attend Harvard and Yale, Rarely is 
the question asked: Was our presi-
dent learning at Harvard and Yale? 
Did he truly earn his "gentleman's 
C: or did he rely on Daddy's influ-
ence to get him through while he 
staggered from one frat party to 
another in a booze and coke haze? 

The truth is that Dubya has 
been able to hide his incompe-
tence by using his family's money 
and his father's influence.

They're all sitting back, not hurt-

I will leave the reader with a 
question . Parents have the technical 
and legal tools at their disposal to 
prevent their minor children from 
watching pornography (quite right-
ly so), or even good erotic films (a 
little less nghtly so) . Why, then , 
don't they havc the same tools to 
prevent their children from wa tch-
ing conservative pornography?

They have a right to say so, 

some would say. I say, ii's OK if 
they do it to their own kids, there's 
nothing we can do about it. But 
everyone else's kids - leave them 
out of it. 

OK, now some of you are say-
ing: "It 's only a club! Get a grip! " 

, And I know that this is like a man 
with a chisel standing next to the 
wall we have separating us from 
another Spanish Inquisition . Do 
we let him go for it? Will he take 
just a little bit and leave the rest? 
Or will he weaken the wall just 
enough , just slightly so that it ' ll 
crack and slowly crumble into 
dust? Or wiII he come back the 
next day with a bigger chisel , figur-
ing that since he was allowed to 
use the little one, something just a 
tiny bit bigger won 't matter? 

In a few years he'll have a jack-
hammer.

GOP Support for Bush's Budget C~ts 
Waivers in Congress 

WASHINGTON - Even as 
he battles to win legis lative 
approval for his $1.6 trillion tax 
cut , President Bush faces an 
escalating fight in Congress over 
his proposal to cut or restrain 
spending on a wide swath of gov-
ernment programs. 

ot only are Democrats in 
Congrc55 opposed, but also 
some of Bush 's fellow 
Republicans have signaled that 
they will have difficulty going 
along with his plan to provide 
increases for the military and 
cducation while cutti ng or freez-
ing many other departments. 

Sen . Pete V. Domenici , R-
, .M., chairman of the Senate 
Budget Committee, has said that 
overall spending on government 
programs outside Social Security 
and Medicare will probably have 
to increase next year by more 
than the 4 percent sought by 
Bush. 

"Can we, in fact, do all the 
thil;gs that have been recom-
mended with 4 percent growth?" 
Domenici asked at a Budget 
Committee hearing this month . 
"I don 't know if we can." 

Hovering over the issue, espe-

cially in the minds of Democrats, 
are recollections of the aftermath 
of the fiscal decisions of the 
1980s. 

In 1981 , President Ronald 
Reagan cut taxes and sought 
large increases in Pentagon 

"Can we, in fact, do all 
the things that have been 
recommended with 4 
percent growth?" 

- Pet. Y. DonIenIcI 
Senator, R-N.M. 

spending, as Bush is likely to do 
in coming years. But Reagan also 
allowed spending on many 
domestic programs to grow. 

The results were surges in the 
budget deficit and the national 
debt and economic and political 
scars still apparent in fiscal poli-
cy two decades later. 

"People in both parties are 
fundamentally concerned about 
the Reagan precedent, that this 
tax cut will be followed by an 
increase in military spending, 

unsustainable new programs and 
an expanding debt," Sen. Robert 
G. Torricelli, D-N,J., said. 

White House officials say the 
political and economic situation 
today is very different from the 
one Reagan faced. The projected 
surplus of $5.6 trillion in the 
next decade, they said, provides a 

. considerable buffer against slip-
ping back into the red. In 1981, 
the government ran a $79 'billion 
deficit. 

They also said that Bush is 
prepared to take on his own 
party if necessary to limit spend-
ing increases, even if it means 
vetoing appropriations bills. 

Spending increases of the size 
appr~ved by the Republican 
Congress and President Bill 
Clinton in recent years, includ-
ing last ye~r's 8 percent increase 
in discretionary spending, 
"would not only destroy the 
budget surplus but would 
require, in the end, an increase in 
taxes: Lawrence B. Lindsey, 
Bush's chief economic adviser, 
said.

Political Tunnoil Threatens Brazil's Prez 
BRASILIA, Brazil - A ran-

corous split with his chief leg-
is/ativt! ally and a barrage of cor-
ruption accusations are suddenly 
threatening to blow apart the 
fractious governing alliance 
President Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso has held together si nce 
1995. 

The dispute, which has shaken 
the stock market and helped drive 
the currency to a two-year low 
against the dollar, threatens the 
sweeping economic reforms that 
have been the hallmark of 
Cardoso's two terms in office and 
have brought a burst of growth, 
stability and foreign investment to 
Brazil. 

The growing political turbu-
Icnce began in mid-February, 
when Sen . Antonio Carlos 
Magalhaes was forced to relin-
quish the presidency of the 
Senate, which he had held since 
1997, to another government sup-
porter who happens to be·his bit-
ter enemy. 

In secret, Magalhaes immedi-
ately went to federal prosecutors 
to accuse his Sllccessor and aides 
to Cardoso, who leaves office at 
the end of next year, of corrup-
tion . Magalhaes, who hiA1self con-

fronts corruption allegations, 
claimed that senior officials took 
bribes while selling off state-
owned telephone and mining 
companies and that Cardoso 
knew of these and other abuses. 

While the president's office, in 
a written rejoinder issued March 
5, acknowledged "irregularities" 
in some government agencies, 
which were being investigated, it 

"Cardoso really can't 
touch corruption himself, 
because if he did, half 
his coalition would be 
implicated and the 
alliance would fall 
apart. " 

- DaYid FIeIKIIer. 
Political Science professor 

also accused Magalhaes of "igno-
ble slanders unworthy of a sena-
tor" and said that all accusations 
that Cardoso had ordered "any 
cover-up of official misconduct" 
were fa lse and "deserve repudia-
tion." 

Ordinary Brazilians are clearly 
disgusted with the bickering, and 
one result is that Cardoso's poll 
ratings have plummeted. 

"This has been tremendously 
debilitating for the government: 
said Alexandre Barros, a leading 
political analyst here. "The public 
is saying, 'You don't take us seri-
ously, you're playing games among 
yourselves, and we foot the bill:" 

Opposition parties are pushing 
for special investigative commit-
tees to look into Magalhaes' accu-
sations, which would result in 
weeks of televised hearings. 

"If they succeed in getting an 
inquiry authorized, then we're 
going to have turmoil for the next 
few months and everything else 
gets put on hold: said David 
Fleischer, a professor of political 
science at the National University 
of Brasilia. 

"That's the problem for the 
government: he added, 
"Cardoso really can't touch cor-
ruption himself, because if he 
did, half his coalition would be 
implicated and the alliance 
would fall apart."

Honolulu: 
Survival in the ocean 
depend on communication 
c.tInu ... ,.... ..... 1 
missing its scheduled return to 
port. 

[n some of the world's mili-
taries, such a comment would be 
tantamount to insubordination. 

But Sloan's warning reflected 
the traits that the Navy tries to 
instill in its officers: Speak up, 
when necessary, even if comman-
ders might not like what they 
hear. 

"[ have it under control: 
Waddle replied. 

Investigators testifying before a 
rare court of inquiry at Pearl 
Harbor Naval Station over the last 
week outlined a series of errors by 
the captain and crew in the 
moments before the submarine 
surfaced abruptly and collided 
with a Japanese trawler, the Ehime 
Maru. 
• The investigators also opened a 

rare window on the cloistered, 
tight-knit world of a submarine 
crew in action. 

[n the military, order and disci-
pline are paramount. At the same 
time, it has long been thought that 
the greatest strength of the U.S. 
military was its empowerment of 
relatively junior officers to speak 
their minds. 

Nowhere is that more true than 
aboard submarines, where life and 

AIDS: 
Musevini did not deny 
making the comment 
ContInu ... ,.... ..... 1 

The issue began early in the 
campaign, when allies of President 
Yoweri Museveni began whisper-
ing that Besigye has AIDS, which is 
caused by H[V, the human 
immunodeficiency virus. Besigye, 
who is 44 and apparently in good 
physical condition, brushed off the 
accusations, and challenged other 
candidates to be tested if HIV sta-
tus is to be a qualification for pub-
lic service. 
- That seemed to settle the issue. 
And it did not appear to hurt 
Btsigye in the polls, which gives 
him roughly 40 percent of the vote. 
The election is on Monday. . 

But then this week, Time maga-
zine published an article that 
quotes M useveni saying flatly : 
"Besigye is suffering from AIDS." 
Some patients' advocates said this 
showed Museveni is insensitive to 
sitk people. 

Besigye, in a news conference 
on Saturday, made the most of it 
politically: "He's trying to create a 

death in the deep depend on clar-
ity of communication. 

"A submarine is really differ-
ent: said Bernard M. Kauderer, a 
retired vice admiral. "In a subma-
rine - and it's very difficult to 
describe - there is a sense and a 
need for teamwork." 

What was most striking, then, 
about the first week of testimony 
was the disclosure that in the min-
utes before the collision, some 
subordinates aboard the 
Greeneville had reservations about 
Waddle's orders, and yet f~iled to 
challenge him. 

Investigators have been puzzled 
as to why on that day aboard the 
Greeneville, the system broke 
down with catastrophic results. 
The Greeneville slammed the 
Ehime Maru, its rudder knifing 
through the vessel's hull. Nine of 
the Ehime Maru's 35 crew mem-
bers, including four fisheries stu-
dents, were lost at sea. 

"This is not a ship where you 
would be shot for talking to the 
commanding officer: said Rear 
Adm. Charles H. Griffiths, who 
conducted the Navy's preliminary 
investigation. 

The submarine commander's 
past successes, Griffiths suggest-
ed, were such that "it may have 
substantially broken the inclina-
tion .of the crew as a whole to give 
him timely and forceful backup" 
when things started to go wrong.

situation whereby persons with 
HIV are discriminated" against. 

Like most African countries, 
Uganda has been hit hard by the 
disease, and at one time had an 
infection rate of 30 percent. Many 
patients are voters. 

A~d many voters are like Rona 
Namubiru, who lost her older 
brother, also a doctor, to AIDS. "[f 
he has it, he can still be president: 
she said at a rally for Besigye. 
"What's wrong with that?" . 

The Museveni camp has eon-
ceded that the remarks hun them 
- though Uganda is often regard-
ed as one of the world's success 
stories in dealing with AIDS, hav-
ing cut down infection rates from 
30 percent to roughly 10 percent. 
"Many people who have A[DS are 
alive today because of me." the 
president said at a news conference 
Sunday. "They should thank me. [ 
have heard people; they are saying [ 
am against people with A[DS. No, 
no, no'" 

Museveni did not deny making 
the comment to Time magazine, 
but contended that his remarks 
were taken slightly out of context.

Newspapers Try to Cope with Slowdown and Stock Expectations 
SA JOSE, Calif - Mike 

Cassidy, a columnist for The San 
Jose (Calif.) Mercllry News, wrote 
a letter on Wednesday to P. 
Anthony Ridder, chief executive 
of Knight Ridder, which owns The 
Mercury News. 

In it, Cassidy said he asked if it 
was not time for a business leader 
like Ridder "to stand up to irra-
tional markets and redefine finan-
cial success." 

If he did that, Cassidy suggest-
ed , Ridder could relax the profit 
goals he had set for The Mercury 
News and avoid the newsroom 
layoffs that the paper's publisher, 
jay T. Harris, had warned were 
comlllg. 

The message' of Cassidy'S letter 
resonates far beyond San Jose. 
Few, if any, of the country's large 
newspapers are free of the pain 
caused by widespread doub/e-
digit declines in help-wanted 
advertising. 

Newsrooms across the country 
face budget cuts. In San jose, the 
announcement of the first layoffs 
in a generation is expected short-
ly. Layoffs have already been 
announced at The Akron (Ohio) 
Beacon Journal, another Knight 
Ridder newspaper, and the paper 
has scrapped its Sunday maga-
zine. 

The Arizona Republic, owned 
by Gannett Co., has cut back news 

space in its feature sections. The 
New York Times has cut the news 
space in regional weekly sections 
in the New York area. Such cuts 
are one way newspapers have of 
coping with declining ad revenue 
while still producing the profits 
Wall Street expects. 

Knight Ridder executives like 
Polk Laffoon IV, vice president for 
corporate communications, 
warned that if the stock price 
dipped too far, a company could 
become a prime takeover target, 
as investors might sell to ~omeone 
who promised a higher return 
whether or not they cared about 
the quality of journalism. 

"What I think often people 

inside the industry might not 
understand is how important the 
health, the overall health of the 
business, is: Laffoon said. 
"Unfortunately, it's a truism if 
business isn't growing and pros-
pering, it's often going the other 
way." 

The dot-com crash in 2000 
coincided with a 20 percent 
increase in newsprint prices in 
2000, which brought the price to 
about $610 a metric ton , and 
paper companies aim to put 
another $50 price increase into 
effect in March. 

With costs up and revenue 
down, circulation price increases 
are not filling the gap. So publish-

ers are turning to cost clilling. 
Editors argue that layoffs, far 

rarer in journalism than in other 
professions, can do long-term 
damage to a newspaper's ability to 
cover its community. 

If deteriorating journalism 
damages the newspaper's reputa-
tion, this reasoning goes, the 
newspaper will lose customers 
and value in the long run . 

Cassidy, the Mercury News 
columnist, said that Ridder wrote 
a "respectful" answer to his letter, 
saying the exact nature of the cuts 
there had not yet been decided.

Persian: 
Students of all back-
grounds attended 
ContInued from ..... 1 

"Especially those who can't go 
home because of finals week: 
Tabatabai added. 

" oRouz," which means "new 
day" in the Persian language, Farsi, 
is a 20-day celebration. The year 
begins on the Spring Equinox, 
which falls on March 20 this year, 
in the middle of finals week. 
Consequently, many students will 
not be able to go home and cele-
brate with their families. 

Marshall freshman Yashar 
Parvin was excited about the night. 

"It gets me back in the mood of 
the Persian culture," Parvin said. "I 
want to meet all the Persians com-
ing tonight from the Southern 
California area." 

The cultural presentations 
included an overview of the 
Persian new year holiday, which 
dates back as many as 3,000 years. 

One of the major traditions in 
celebrating the new year is setting 
a speciaL table with seven specific 
items, known as "Haftseen ." These 

items begin with the letter US" in 
Farsi, l!nd each are symbolic of 
various attributes of life, including 
beauty, represented by apples; 
health, represented by garlic; and 
fertility, represented by eggs. A 
Haftseen table was on display just 
outside the ballrooms for guests to 
see. 

Marcia Strong. A.S. adviser for 
the Persian Club, called the night 
an "overall success:' and saw it as a 
great chance for everyone to come 
to learn about the celebration. 

"I know that the club invites 
people of all backgrounds to come: 
she said. "[ know they invite parents 
and administrators to come, as well. 
It's a good tool to educate the com-
munity. [t lets them learn more 
than what's at face value." 

Indeed, students of various 
backgrounds were celebrating. 

"[ just wanted to have fun and 
be aware of the culture: she said. 

Doc: 
Tom Tucker wrote the 
nomination Letter 
ContInued from ..... 1 
applicants. 

"They look at GPA first." 
Kha/eghi said . "This is why [ 
thought [ had no chance of. win-
ning." 

Rather, he was evaluated on his 
"academic product: an essay in 
which he described his role as A.S. 
president. 

Assistant Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Tom Tucker wrote 
the letter nominating Khaleghi. 

"I think Doc is a special student 
leader and a special student, so [ 
thought it would be appropriate to 
nominate him," Tucker said. "[ just 
think he's unique: his energy and 
involvement in a variety of campus 
activities." 

Tucker pointed out Khaleghi's 
qualities in the academic realm in 
his nomination letter. 

"[Kha/eghil is also dedicated, 
honest and provides leadership 
while preserving an uncompro-
mised pattern of personal integri-
ty." Tucker stated in the letter. 
"Khaleghi frequently demonstrates 
the exceptional management abili-
ty to foster concise solutions to 
complex and intricate organiza-
tional and operational problems." 

Both Khaleghi and Tucker 
remember when each learned of 
Khaleghi 's win of the honor. 

Twice a day Khaleghi was 
checking the mail that arrived in 
the A.S. boxes because he was 
waiting for medical school accep-
tances. He spotted a big envelope 
from USA TodIly . 

O[ tore it open, looked and went 
nurs: Khaleghi said. •

A closer look at the use of spirits throughout the 
ages, from production to consumption 

he Romans had 
Dionysus, the god 
of wine, College 
students have 
John, the porcelain 
god. Both are 

that people have 
prayed to intoxicated. 

By most accounts, alcohol con-
sumption has been around since 
nearly the beginning of the human 
race, While it may have begun with 
some primitive people eating rotten 
fruiCand getting a slight high, it has 
evolved into a raging social phenom-
enon that has many people spending 
their lives in an alcoholic haze. 

While alcohol has become 
, widely popular, its origins and dis .. 
tinguished history have remained 
widely unknown to many of those 
who partake in its many wonders, 
WIIIIt ,. AIMIIoI't 

Alcohol is a depressant drug 
that affects the brain and causes 
reduced social inhibitions and 
relaxes the bodr' according to an 
Area 51 aJcoho information Web 
site . located at 

http://area57.upsu ,plym ,ac, uk! 
- harVgraphicaVgrphalc. html 

Alcohol is produced when sug-
ars come into contact with air-
borne yeast and ferment. This 
process most commonly occurs in 
fruits, vegetables and grain; howev-
er, alcohol can be produced . from 
just about any fermentable materi-
al. including flowers, honey, the sap 
of trees, milk and almost any plant 

' or animal substance that contains 
carbohydrates or sugar, according 
to an anicle called "The History of 
Alcohol, Part I" at 
http://gtt,thtinfo·orglakolloll 

While there are several different 
types of alcohol, the types most 
commonly used in alcoholic drinks 
are ethynol and ethyl alcohol. 

"'" Alcohol consumption is 
thought to date back to prehistoric 
man , Some modern-day animals 
have been observed to consume 
fermented fruits and enjoy the 
slight high that it brings, so it is 
thought that early man also experi-
mented with the intoxicating 

effects of fermented fruits, 
One of the earliest mentions of 

wine makin1l. comes from an 
Egyptian papyrus that dates back to 
3500 B,C" according to the British 
alcohol infor/TIation site mentioned 
above. 

Paintings on ancient walls 
revealed that the Egyptians were 
also accomplished beer makers as 
well, according to "A History of 
Beer and Alcohol," located at 
http://wy.essortment.comlbeeralcohol-
hiuueh,htm 

These wall paintings showed 
models of breweries and descrip-
tions of the types of beer that were 
made. 

According to the Web site, the 
Egyptians made three different 
types of beer, Red beer was the 
most common, made by mixing 
undercooked loaves of barley or 
wheat bread with water and 
crushed wheat and allowing it to 
ferment in the sun. The liquid was 
then drained and stored, This beer 
is still made in Sudan and pans of 
Egypt, Sweet beer and black. beer 

were also made by the Egyptians. 
Once people discovered that 

alcohol could be produced by fer-
menting sugar, it was being "manu-
factured" around the world. In 
tropical areas, it was common to 
use the sap of palm trees and cac-
tus. In the far East and Europe, 
honey and milk were used to pro-
duce alcohol. In the early days of 
the United States, it was common 
to use corn, barley, wheat, sugar 
cane, potatoes and other plants to 
make alcohol, according to "The 
History of Alcohol , Part I." 

According to the article, alcohol 
soon became a large part of many 
tribal and religious ceremonies, 

Two Dutch colonists were the 
first to establish a private brewery 
in America in 1612, according to "A 
History of Beer and Alcohol." The 
brewery was located on the tip of 
Manhattan Island, where the first 
Dutch-American child was born, a 
site thought to be good luck. by 
many of the settlers, 

According to the same Web site. 
the first public brewery was opened 

in the United States in 1622 in 
New Amsterdam, 

Beer making was a struggle for 
early settlers due to a lack of grains 
and hops, necessary to make the 
peer, Even today, there are on ly 
three states that grow hops: Idaho, 
Washington and Oregon . 
n. Affects 

The main attraction of alcohol ic 
drinks is their ability to produce a 
state of intoxication . 

According to the Area 51 Web 
site, alcohol is absorbed into the 
bloodstream anywhere from five to 
10 minutes from its ingestion. It 
then travels through the blood 
stream and delivers the alcohol 
throughout the body. The result is a 
relaxation of the muscles, which can 
lead to poor coordination, Increased 
amounts of alcohol in the system 
can lead to slurred speech, double 
vision, loss of balance and nausea. 

If enough alcohol is ingested, 
the results can be deadly. Since

Graduating. I never thought I 
would be saying - well, typing -
that word in this regard. Not to 
sound macho or anything, but 
there are few things that freak me 
out; truthfully, this is one of the 
few things that does. I'm placed 
in a situation that I'm sure most 
graduating seniors are in : limbo. 
We're caught between the memo-
ries of the past and the possibili-
ties of the future at the same 
time. 

I've had some great memories 
of college and a few bad ones. So 
what, then, is there for me to fear 
now that I'm nearing the end of 
another chapter in my life? Allow 
me to explain . 

Lately, I've been pondering this 
question: Have I been successful 
in my tour of duty here at UCSD? 
Success can be measured in dif-
ferent ways, particularly in a uni-
versity environment. Getting A's 
in every single class is certainly 

successful (no, I'm am definitely 
not talking about myself) . 
Attending every frat or sorority 
party is pretty impressive too (not 
me), as is hooking up with an 
Alpha Zeta Phi girl (I wish it were 
me). So is being editor of the 
opinon section. 

In my opinion, having a suc-
cessful college career involves 
attaining experience. A question 
we should all ask ourselves from 
time to time is: "Have I experi-
enced enough?" This is a ques-
tion that I ask myself, as it leads to 
the answer to the first question 
regarding success. 

Experience, as the wise man 
would confess, comes with age. 
Experience comes from exposure; 
it comes from how willing a per-
son is to set himself up for the 
risk. It comes from the glory of 
victory and the agony of defeat. It 
comes from merely living and, 
more importantly, being able to

TIle Laws 

Throughout American history, 
alcohol has been the· target of the 
law. While some may think that life 
before Prohibition was one big 
alcoholic haze, even the early 
colonists had strict laws against 
alcohol consumption. 

In 1633, Plymouth Plantation 
prohibited the sale of spirits "more 
than two pence worth to anyone 
except strangers just arrived," 
according to a paper prepared by 
Jane Lang McGrew, an attorney 
from Washington, D.C. 

In 1637, Massachusetts ordered 
that no person should remain in a 
tavern "longer than necessary 
occasions. " 

While such laws were common 
in the colonies, there was no attempt 
to prohibit the sale of alcohol prior 
to the 18th century. Even then, there 
was no widespread prohibition, at 
least not until the 20th century. 

In 1920, the United States rati-
fied the 18th amendment to the 
Constitution of the United States. 
This amendment prohibited Ute 
sale of alcohol in the United States. 

As it turns out, the amendment 
did not eradicate1he-use of alcohol 
in the United States. In fact, it 
opened the door for mobsters and 
criminals to brew their own alcohol 
and become rich off its illegal sales. 

With the realization that the 
amendment was doing more harm 
than good, the amendment was 
repealed on Dec. 5, 1933, legalizing 
the sale of alcohol in the United 
States once again. 

The current law in the United 
States is that nobody under the age 
of 21 is allowed to purchase alco-
hol. Additionally, there are laws 
against drinking and driving. While 
the blood alcohol content neces-
sary for conviction on this offense

This is, perhaps, the biggest regret I 
have about college: not studying 
abroad. Of course, it was an initial 
consideration of mine, but I never 
put the effort behind it. I was 
thinking about Sweden, actually, as 
strange as it would seem for an 
Asian to consider. Hockey· is great 
over there during the winter. But, 
unfortunately, I didn't take the 
opportunity. 

Here's some advice to the 
underclassmen: Go abroad! 
Though I didn't, I can assure you it 
will be the one of the best experi-
ences you will have not only in col. 
lege but also in life. I've been told 
enough stories from friends who 
have traveled to know. If you don't 
go, you'll be writing about you~ 
regret of not going (maybe even in 
the school newspaper). 

That's where I am now. Don't 
get me wron$; college has been 
thoroughly enjoyable, even though 
there are some lingering regrets 
about certain missed opportunities, 
and I am not referring solely to 
studying abroad. 

This takes me to the future and 
the possibilities in store. For once 
in my life, I am truly clueless about 
what will happen in the future.

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, RIVERSIDE 

Monday, March 12,2001 

Horoscope: 
See what the week has for 
Leo, Virgo,. Libra and more 
Continued from ..... 14 
emotionally withdrawn . Let others 
have extra time LO reflect or gather 
insight, Cancer: Soon relationships 
will again move rapidly forward. 
After Thursday attend to 
parent/child re!ationships: Loved 
ones may now require your daily 
dedication. 

Leo (Ju1r 23-Aug. 22) 
Friends and relatives may be 

self-involved this week, Leo. Early 
Tuesday watch for loved ones to 
be overly focused on past disap-
pointments and distant relation-
ships. Some Leos may also experi -
ence the return of an old friend or 
co lleague. After Friday watch also 
for fast fin ancial changes or newly 
amended records: Research and 
small money matters may be in 
error. . 

YIrIo (A ug. 23-$ept. 22) 
Romantic energy is high this 

week , Virgo, but it may also be con-
fusing. Before Thursday expect a 
Triend or lover to introduce a new 

-acquaintance. Over the next few 
days a temporary division of loyal-
ties may be bothersome: Expect 
social or romantic triangles to be 
difficult to avoid. No long- lasting 
or serious overtones can be expect-
ed here. but do watch for brief 
social conflicts and inappropriate 
flirtations. Wait for clarity: New 
romantic passions will calm by 
early next week. 

UbnI (Sept. 23-0ct. 23) 
Lovers or fa mily members may 

present unusual past information 
or make contact with an old friend 
this week, Libra. Unfinished emo-
tions, nostalgia and Incomplete 
relationships will have a tendency 
t resu rface over the next few days. 
Use this time to release unwanted 
fears or address long-standing dif-
ferences with loved ones. Pace 
yourself and wait for valuable 
insights. 

Scorpio (Oct . 24·Nov. 21) 
Thoroughly discuss new pro-

jects and research tindings with 
others this week, Scorp: For the 
next eight days, work information, 
facts and figu res can easily be mis-
taken or 10 t. Some Scorpios may 
also find that intense romantic flir-
tations now cause an ongoing dis-
traction . If so, plan for social invi-
tations to sharply increase: New 
attractions will bring unusual 
romantic choices before ' early 
April. 

aa,m.nua (Nov. 22-Dec. 21) 
Heavy or negative social obliga-

Soapbox: 
Graduation means more 
decisions to be made 
ContInued from pag. 15 
When I was YOllnger, the choices 
were simple : l'd continue on with 
school; one grade leads to the 
next. After high school, I knew I 
would attend UCSD. But now, 
things are different. I've reached 
another chasm to cross and all I 
can do for now is look out into the 
horizon . There are a dozen bridges 
that I can cross and it's · nearly 
impossible to choose between 
them. 

Maybe this is where the fear 
comes from . It 's not from th e 
unwillingness to graduate. Trust 
me, I'm ready to leave. It's not the 
fear of committing myself to an 8-
to-5 job. It's the initial step onto 
one of the creaky bridges .. It's forc-
ing oneself to take that important 
step. And there are no nets. Do we. 
do I, have the experience to choose 
correctly? 

Ultimately, there is only one 
way, to find out and that is to take 

tions will now fade, Sage. Over the 
last few days many Sagittarians 
have felt restricted by the emotion-

'31 demands of another or frustrated 
by a lack of time for personal rela-
tionships. All of this now changes: 
Early Wednesday expect friends, 
loved ones and colleagues to adopt 
a more cheerful and optimistic out-
look. Social and workplace atmos-
pheres will soon improve. Sage: By 
early next week expect new group 
instructions and rare social intro-
ductions. 

CaprIconI (Dec . 22-Jan. 19) 
Relationships from the past will 

now begin to make sense, Cap. 
Much of this will directly affect 
outdated love affairs and lingering 
memories: Expect the past actions 
or words of loved ones to no 
longer be distracting. Subtle emo-
tions are at work this week, Cap: 
Watch for intense dreams, key 
adjustments in present relation-
ships and a newfound bond with 
loved ones. 

_ ... ua (Jan. 2()'Feb. 18) 
Let others handle their own 

problems this week, Aquarius. 
Now, a new social and romantic era 
arrives: after Wednesday expect 
others to briefly admit their mis-
takes or offer unique explanations. 
Trust your instincts, Aquarius: 
Long-standing differences will not 
easily fade. Late Thursday a col-
league may require extra time to 
complete an important task: Be 
patient. 

PI_a (Feb. 19-March 20) 
Before midweek, Pisces, a col-

league may request your daily 
assistance or guidance. Over the 
next three days many Pisceans may 
feci pressured to adopt the role of 
instructor, group facilitator or pub-
lic mentor. Offer suppon but pro-
tect your own ideas, Pisc~; at the 
moment friends and younger col-
leagues may be highly stressed and 
limited in their ski lls. 

If Your Birthday la thl. Week: 
Physical and emotional energy 

will return in the coming five to six 
weeks, Pisces: Watch for a four- to 
fi ve-month period of daily social 
and romantic challenges to now 
steadi ly fade. Many Pisceans will 
now begin a serious effort to 
improve home relationsh ips and 
bring greater intimacy into their 
lives. Romance will gain momen-
tum by ea rly June, Pisces: Remain 
patient and watch for a va riety of 
new invitations and social opportu-
nities to trigger important emo-
tional decisions. Later this year, 
group investments, team assign-
ments or fast workplace changes 
will bring much excitement: By late 
September a unique career propos-
al will require serious considera-
tion. 

the initia l step. And quite a big 
step it is indeed, but I have the 
confidence to take it. I've gone 
through a great deal since I came 
here, both good and bad experi-
ences, but experiences nonethe-
less. And with each came a lesson 
and memory to remember. Four 
years ' worth of hard work and 
grea t times leads to this and the 
pressure is bui lding to show that 
all that I've worked for wasn 't for 
naught. I'm ready to get the hell 
out of here, but that doesn't mean 
that I'm not scared.

A true test of a team's character 
is how it responds to a heart-
breaking loss. Strong teams find a

The match started out in dou-
bles where Lyndsey Tadlock and 
Stephanie Moriarty ran into some 
stiff competition at No.1 . Things 
started out well fo r the pair, as they 
won th e fi rst three games and 
looked to be rolling to an easy vic-
tory. Kristina Tomas and Mary 
Pung of Bakersfield had other 
ideas, though, and the march was 
quickly deadlocked again at four. 
The team exchanged breaks over 
the next four games and the match 
was tied at six. The team from Bak-
ersfield, however, was too tough, as 
it broke Tadlock's serve and held 
on for the 8-6 win. 

At o. 2 doubles, Melisa Liao 
and Julie Westerman raced out to a 
5-2 lead :lI1d lOoked to be running 
away with the match . This changed 
quickly, and before long the match 
was back on se rve at 6-5. Liao and 
Westerman, however, did not fold 
under the pressure and came back 
to take the match 8-5. 

Ashley O'Neil and Kristina 
Jansen had a similar start at No. 3 
doubles, but they never let their 

opponents back in the game to 
secure the victory and take the 
match 8-4. 

Carrying a 2-1 edge into singles 
play gave the Tritons confidence, 
but quickly they saw that that edge 
wouldn't be needed. 

0' eil took on Tomas at No. 1 
singles and had a rough time. 
Tomas hit almost every ball within 

inches of the line and made it 
almost impossible for O 'Neil to 
gather any momentum. The match 
ended in a 6-1 , 6-1 win for Tomas 
and Bakersfield. 

Coach Liz Laplante knew that 
that match-up would be difficult. 

"We knew they'd be strong up

ConUnued from PICe 20 

quarter and into Spring Break. 
Their next match will be here at 
home on March 30 against an 
old familiar Division III rival, 
Gustavus Adolphus COllege of 
Minnesota . This match shou ld 
be an exce llent indicator on how 

far the Tritons have grown in the 
1ast year. So get out of your 
dorm room and spend a won-
derful sunny day watching some 
great tennis and rooting the Tri-

path .

Tritons beat Villanova, lose to rival SDSU good effort. We were nearly there 

in the victory circle but couldn't 
quite pull it off. I thought that 
they were a solid team, much like 
the better teams in the [Califor-
nia Collegiate Athletic Associa-
tion.]" 

The loss to Boston College 
came a day after a tough-fought 
battle with cross-town foe San 
Diego State. The Tritons fell to 
the Aztecs 6-1. This match was 
not originally scheduled but was 
played because both teams had 
so many rainouts earlier in the 
year. 

The Tritons were obviously 
outmatched against Division I San 
Diego State, but Steidlmayer took 
some detin ite bright spots out of 
the match. 

"We gain a lot from playing 
State: Steidlmayer said. "Some 
learn that they can play with those 
guys, some learn what they need 
to !mprove." 

Steidl mayer was particularly 
impressed wi th the performance 

- of Meyer, who is ,i ust returning to 
hea lth after a surgery that he had 
in September. Meyer put together 
a solid three-set win against 
Travis Hasson of San Diego State 
at No. 2 singles and teamed up 
with Wilson to win 8-3 at No. 2 
dou bles. 

. "Both wins [against Boston 
COll ege and San Diego State] 
demonstrate that he is moving in 
the right direction," Steidl mayer 
said of Meyer. "But it is his effort 
in practice to concentra te and 
focus on the things he needs to 
work on that is making him bet-
ter."

On Friday night the UCSD 
women 's water polo team hosted 
cross-town rival Sa n Diego State 
University at the Canyonview Pool. 

The night before, UCS D took 
care of Villanova in a commanding 
17-6 victory. 

Junior Emma Kudritzki led the 
tcam in scoring with five goals. 

Also contributing with multiple 
goals were sophomore Samara Sil-
verman and junior Erin Welsh, 
who each had three. Elena Tel-
lechea threw in two. Sophomore 
Megan Hubbs put in a strong per-
formance at the goalie position, 
making nine saves. 

Looking to build on their win 
aga inst Villanova, the Tritons 
entered Friday night's game with an 
8-6 record and were ranked 12th in 
the National Collegiate Top 20 Poll. 

In cold temperatures and inter-
mittent rainfa ll , UCS D and San 
Diego State battled for four quar-

ters with the biggest deficit of the 
game being just two goals. In the 
end, the Tritons, fell to the Aztecs 
6-4. 

"We played a good hard game, 
but [San Diego State] came out on 
top," Silverman said. "Next time 
it'll be di fferent." 

After two quarters of so lid play 
from both teams, San Diego State 
led with a score of 3-2. 

In the th ird quarter the Tritons 
increased the intensity and tied the 
game on a goal by Hilary Smith, a 
senior, with 4:25 remaining in the 
quarter. 

Hubbs did her part by making 
several critical saves. In the first 
minute of the third quarter, Hubbs 
made an impressive stop to prevent 
the Aztecs from going up 4-2. The 
score would remain tied at 3-3 for 
the rest of the quarter. 

In the fin al quarter, however, 
San Diego State exploded fo r three 
goals to put the ga me out of reach 
for the Tritons, as UCS D managed 
only one more goal in the game. 

The Tritons now have a lon g 
layoff throughout the rest of the

turn in the city. there is positive talk 
and hope for a bright future. 

Take. for instance. the Padres. It 
is currently the time of spring 
training in baseball land . Hell, the 
definition of baseball's spring train-
IIlg is hope. At this point, every 
team has a chance of winning the 
World Series. From the high rollers 
to those who pay their players 
peanuts, from teams with three Cy 
Young Award winners to those 
with a lot of nobodys, from the 
I ew York Yankees to the Minneso-
ta Twins. every team can dream of 
willing it all. Every ne has the 
same record. 0-0. 

This includes the Padres. The 
Friars are as upbeat as anyone. 
They have promising young pitch-
ers and solid vets taking the 
mound. [n the field . the likes of 
Ryan Klesko and Phil Nevin would 
make any fan excited. and to top it 
all off, Mr. Padre himself, Tony 
Gwynn. is roaming right field once 
again . Will the Padres be crowned 
World Series champs come Octo-
ber? It's doubtful, but right now 
still possible. 

San Diego's other sports fran-
chise is also benefiting from a bout 
of optimism and is actually looking 
like a sports team. The Chargers. it 
appears, are moving toward being a 
team that could earn a playoff 
berth. The team has strengthened 
an already tough defense, and it has 
remedied the quarterback problem 
with the signing of Doug Flutie. 
Plus, the team has the No. 1 pick in 
this spring's draft. John Butler was 
hired as general manager, and Norv 
Tuner was brought in as offensive 
coordinator. The team has made 
itself competitive once again . 

Sure, it's hard to be positive 
after last year, but there is nowhere 
to go but up. [t makes you wish 'the 
foo tball season would start now 
(the XFL doesn't count). 

This sense of optimism extends 
to campus. Sure, it is not as great as 
it was during the fall, when the 
women's soccer team was prowling 
R[MAC field en route to another 
title. But righ t now, with winter 
quarter winding down, things are 
looking up. 

Spring rings eternal here, too. 
There are about 10 Triton sports 
taking place right now. If you want 
softball action, check out UCSD's 
team. They boast a 10-6 record. 
Both the men's and women's ten -
nis teams look like they'll have 
good years. The swim team is ready 
for its final meets, with the real 
possibility of some titles coming 
our way. Hungry Moses is most 
definitely exci ted right now about 
UCSD sports. 

See, sports are blooming in our 
neck of the woods. No Padres in the 
cellar. 0 Chargers losing almost 
every game. It's just UCSD sports 
with nonstop action all the way. 

So, even if your tea has gone 
cold and you wonder why you got 
up at all, San Diego sports will 
remind you that it's not so bad, it's 
not so bad at all.

PORTS 
UCSD Has a Hard Weekend 
Tritons lose three games in three days as their record ,drops to 7-14 
By scon BURROUGHS 
Associate Sports Editor 

UCSD and California State 
University Stanislaus faced off this 
weekend in an important four-
game California Collegiate Athlet-
ic Association series at Triton 
Field. 

Stanislaus managed to sweep 
the first two games from the Tri-
tons in a Friday doubleheader 
before UCSD got fired up and 
came back for a victory in Satur-
day's rematch. Unfortunately on 
Sunday the Tritons had no juice 
left as they dropped the final game 
to CSUS 13-3. 

[n the opening game it was 
Stanislaus that drew first blood, 
scoring one run in the second' 
inning on an RB[ groundout to 
short by Todd Russell that scored 
Kyle Sleeth, who had started the 
inning with a double. 

Cal State Stanisla us added a 
pair more in each of the next two 
innings, building a 5-0 lead before 
the Tritons eventually broke their 
string of goose eggs with two rllns 
in the fifth . 

David Hawk started the UCSD 
rally with a walk and eventually 
scored on Blair Suzuki 's RB[ 
groundout. Anthony Lococo, who 
had reached earlier on an error, 
was then driven in on Chad Addi-
son's clutch single. The rally was 
cut short, though, when 'designat-
ed hitter Ryan Larsen struck out 
looking with two aboard. 

Get Uck: A Triton baseball player dives back to first after the opposing pitcher decides his lead is too big. 

The Tritons managed to add 
one more run in the next inning, 
but it wasn 't enough, as they 

ended up falling to Stanislaus 6-3. 
John Beaven took the loss, 

dropping his record to 2-4, while 
Sam Flores recorded the victory 
for CSUS to improve to 2-0. 

In the nightcap, it was UCSD 
that jumped out to an early lead, 
scoring three runs in the bottom 
of the first in a rally highlighted by 
a Nate Bestul triple that drove in 

Tennis Proves They Can 
Play with Division I 
The Tritons. get punished by San 
Diego State', battle Boston College 
By BIU BURGER 
Senior Staff Writer 

For most Division [[ sports 
programs, the idea of squaring off 
against a Division [ opponent 
seems ludicrous. For even more, 
the idea of actually competing 
with such a program seems like a 
dream. 

This is not so for the UCSD 
men's tennis team. 

The Tritons took on Division [ 
Boston College on SaturMay and 
were narrowly defeated by a score 
of 4-3. 

The ross brought the Tritons' 
record down to a still respectable 
6-4 fo r the year. 

Doubles was truly a battle of 
attrition for both teams. [n all 
three match-ups, there were ups 
and downs. [n the end, Boston 
College took two of the three pro 
sets. 

No. 1 doubles was an epic 
affair that pitted Sameer Chopra 
and Dan Albrecht from UCSD 
against Justin Slattery and Jason 
Cowett of Boston COllege. 

During the first six games, 
there were virtually no opportu-
nities for a break, so the teams 
were tied at three after these 
games. 

That all changed when 
Albrecht smashed an overhead 
straight down into the court and 
over the fence to give the Thtons 

a service break. 
Unfortunately, it didn't list as 

they gave that break right back 
on Chopra'S serve in the next 
game, and again the match was 
deadlocked. The score was 5-6 
when Albrecht's serve was bro-
ken to make it 5-7. From there, 
the hard-hitting Slattery served 
out the match 8-5 for Boston 
College. 

No. 2 doubles looked like it 
would be over quickly when Mike 
Meyer and Jeff Wilson were 
quickly down 0~4 . The two 
fought back and got within a 
game at 6-7, but in the end the 
hole they dug early was too great 
to overcome, and they lost the 
mftCh 6-8 . . 

The Tritons enjoyed better 
luck at No. 3 doubles, where Amir 
Nejad and Everrett Schroeter 
won 8-4. 

In singles, the Thtons got wins 
from Meyer at No. 2, Wilson at 
No. 3 and Schroeter at No. 6, but 
came up one win short of an 
overall victory. 

Head coach Eric Steidl mayer 
was disheartened by the loss, but 
not by the competition nor by his 
team's effort. 

"[ expected to have a tough 
match; Steidlmayer said, "and it 
was that. [Boston COllege! 
played with good heart, and with 

two. The lead was short-lived, 
though, as Stanislaus scored one 
in the first and two apiece in the 
second and third to pull ahead. 

The Tritons threatened to 
score again in the bottom of the 
seventh. Singles by Hawk and 
Suzuki put the Tritons in prime 
position with two outs. Lococo 
stepped up and delivered a key 

triple that scored Hawk and sent 
Suzuki racing toward the plate, 
representing the tying run . 

It was not to be, though, as a 
textbook relay from the CSU 
rightfielder cut him down at the 
plate to end _ the rally and the 
game, 6-5.

UCSD Dance Team Head-
ing to Daytona Beach 
Dancesport will compete against 24 
other teams for national title in April 
By ISUC PlARLMAN 
Associate Sports Editor 

Come the beginning of April, 
the UCSD dance team will pack 
its bags and prance on over to 
Daytona Beach, Fla., to compete 
in the National Dance Alliance 
Collegiate Championships and vie 
against 24 teams from around the 
nation for the national dance title. 

The trip has become an annu-
al event for the dance team, 
which has come in third the pre-
vious two years. 

"The whole year this is what we 
work for; freshman dance team 
member Kanchan Dudani said. 

"We did really well [last year); 
said co-captain Alyssa Boland. 
"We're trying to go back and get 
at least third. Of course, we want 
to get first." . 

The dance team qualified by 
sending a video of their perfor-
mance to the judges, who then 
selected them to try out at the 
preliminaries AprilS. From there, 
the top teams will be chosen to 
dance in the finals the next day. 

"This year is really cool 
because we've been able to do a 
lot more technical things; 
Boland said. "We have a very 
technically strong team." 

According to Boland, another 
benefit of going to Florida is the 
chance to improve team cohe-
siveness. 

"[What we need to work on) 
probably is having fun together; 
she said. "We always have to prac-
tice and work and work. Florida 
will be nice because it will give us 
a chance to be together after 
competition." 

The event marks the culmina-
tion of the team's competition 
season, as they will relax and con-
centrate on recruiting new peopl.e 
during the next quarter. 

"Spring quarter is like our fun 
time," Boland said. "We perform at 
the Sun God festival and at Greek 
events. It's more kicked back." 

The team will also continue to 
look for a coach after losing their 
previous coach last fall. 

"It's hard nQ! ~ving a coach; 
Boland said. -That's our biggest 
weakness." 

But for the moment the team 
is focused on upcoming competi-
tion and raising funds to help pay 
for the trip. 

"We get minimal funding from 
A.S.; Boland said. "We pretty 
much pay for everything out of 
our pockets. This year we're actu-
ally going to A.S. and asking for 
more funding but pretty much 
now we're all on our own.· 

To raise money, the team will 
have a bake sale Thursday on 
Library Walk, from 11 a.m. to 2 
p.m., so go out and support the 
team in their quest for a national 
title.
