GAINESVILLE, Fla. -
Students creating World Wide 
Web home pages at the 
University of Florida could find 
their creations censored if the 
administration deems them 
"inappropriate:: Though some 
claim the school's policy is in 
direct violation of the First 
Amendment, chool administra-
tors contend that the Constitu-
tion does not prevent them from 
limiting the content of student 
pages. "We are, in a sense, a 
publisher, and we follow certain 
guidelines about what we 
publish and what we do not," 
one university official said. The 
university will not permit web 
pages that involve commercial 
or illegal activities.

PALO ALTO, Calif. - A 
$250 million orbital telescope 
is now under construction at 
Stanford University. The 
Gamma Large Array Space 
Telescope will measure 
gamma rays, the most 
energetic form of light in the 
universe. The principal 
sources of gamma rays are 
blazars - galaxies so distant 
that they appear as a single 
point of light. The telescope 
will also provide scientists 
with more data about black

Improved Genetic 
M.-kers Engineered 
LOS ANGELES - Scientists at 
USC and at the Universi ty of 
Alberta have uccessfully tested 
what they believe will be a 
major advance in genetic-
coding techniques. The new 
method improves on the widely 
used genetic-engineering 
technique of tagging DNA 
molecules by using special 
fluorescent markers. The tags 
will help molecular biologists 
map DNA with a much higher 
level of sensitivity than is 
otherwise possible, and will 
increase researchers' ability to 
tmck transactions at the 
molecular-genetic level.

Neuroscientist Named Kuffler Chair 
Mu-Ming Poo, a nationally recognized neuroscien-

tist, has been appointed to the SteJ)hen W. Kuffler Chair 
in biology. He is the first holder of the chair, which was 
established in 1990 by an anonymous gift in honor of 
the late Stephen W. Kutner, a professor at Harvard 
University. The appointment will continue until Poo 
ceases to hold a full-time, tenured professorship at 

. UCSD. 
Poo, who recently joined UCSO's department of 

biology, has been a faculty member at UC Irvine, Yale 
and at the department of Biological Sciences at Colu~ 
bla. He was trained as a biophysicist but is most well-
known for his contributions to cellular, molecular and 
developmental neuroscience. 

Poo's recent research has focused on problemS" 
related to the development of the nervous system, as 
well as how cellular and molecular processes regulate 

ne~ell growth and their interconnections. Poo 's work 
has led to important insights into how natural electrical 
activity and protein factors In the brain may influence 
the synaptic function and the pattern of nerve connec-

A.S. Funds Web Pages 
For Student Groups Lights Sirens-.--· 
INTERNET: A.S. 
spends $500 for extra 
hard-drive space 
By Esth. Yoon 
Staff Writer 

Using funds made available to 
them by the A.S., UCSD's student 
organizations are jumping on the 
Internet bandwagon and creating in-
formational home pages on the 
World Wide Web. 

The web project, which came 
about as a result of campaigning by 
Revelle senior Max Orgiyan, will 
provide registered campus groups 
with their own web sites. 

Orgiyan, who is president of the 
Russian Club, solicited support for 
an A.S_-sponsored network of web 
sites last winter in order to better 
advertise student organizations. 

"What I needed to do was pro-
vide information about the Russian 
Club, and the Russian culture, and 
its people to the UCSD commfl-
nity," Orgiyan said. 

"What I found out was the meet-
ingsdidn 'thelpmuch because people 
didn't know about them, and at the 
meetings we couldn't give them 
enough information. I found that 
other groups were having similar 
problems." 

After the World Wide Web was 
publicized by the media, Orgiyan 
believed that web sites for student 
groups would be a "perfectopportu-

nily" to reach the student body. 
Orgiyan solicited support for his 

project from A.S. Commissioner of 
Operations and Services lean Lee, 
who pushed a proposal for $500 in 
funding through the A.S. Council. 

"Basically, what the A.S. has 
done is purchase extra hard-drive 
space to give these student organi-
zations access to web pages," Lee 
said. "Studenl organizations with 
web sites already up can still be a 
part of this, with links that we pro-
vide them to our system," he said. 

"They put up horne pages and 
advertise whallhey are all about and 
what they're doing," Lee added. 

Orgiyan, acomputer-science ma-
jor, suggested that student organiza-
tions introduced to the web may 
develop around this technology in 
the future. 

"Right now, the web is evolving 
into a completely different technol-
ogy," Orgiyan said. "Before, it was 
just visual with images and infor-
mation. But now. it's more interac-
tive and will provide another me-
dium of communications." 

"It is an interactive technology, 
unlike television, which is a passive 
media. Eventually, you'll be able to 
doeverythingon the web," he added. 

An information night for stu-
dents interested in linking onto stu-
dent-organization web sites is sched-
uled for Tues., Feb. 20 in Gallery B 
of the Price Center, from 4:30 p.m_ 
to 6:30 p.m.

A Umlt Does Not Necessitate a Total Ban 
., Derek v .. Hoften 
ASSOCiate Opinion Editor 

When debating the issue of gun control, both 
sides of the argument throw out endless statistics 
about accidents, homicides and crime rates to bol-
sler their argument and discredil the opposilion. 
Supponers of gun control point to all the accidents 
involvina guns kepi in the home, while opponents 
proudly point out that the few cities wi~h strict ~ • 
COII4Vllawl in flCl have some of the hlghestcnme 
I'I&CI in the nation . 

After • while, il becomes quite IppII'Cftt that 
Ilatillicl do not tell the Il0l)': common IenIe does. 

And common sense says Ibat gun control - if 
enacted properly - will limit the number of acci-
dents and murders caused by guns. 

The worst argument against gun control is also 
the most dangerous: "Because gun conlrol will never 
be able to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, 
we should not even bother trying." In other words, 
let's give up. 

However, we must realize ..... gun control does 
not mean gun eliminalion. No one is claimi", thIt

Fireanns Are Not 
Responsible for 

Criminal Behavior 
By Peter Ch.n, 
Senior Staff Writer 

1997: Public hysteria mounts as automo-
bile-related fatalities exceed 100,000 per 
year. With automobile-related deaths the 
primary cause of death among children be-
tween the ages of one and four, outraged 
parent groups pressure Congress to restrict 

accessibility to cars. 
Anti-car groups rally to ban the pri-

vate use of automobiles. Citizen-mo-
torist groups which gather to defend 
the right of private-car ownership are 
maligned as "extremists." Auto en-
thusiasts who suggest that vehicle 
operators are responsible for these 
deaths are dismissed as lunatics . 
"Cars don't kill people, drivers do" 
becomes a popular refrain which 
mocks defenders of automotive 
freedom . 

Opportunistic politicians, sensing 
an easy hot-bullon issue to campaign 
behind. move in for the kill. Legisla-

tion engineered by demagogues 
passes through Congress and is signed 

by the president. 
In one year. "high perfonnance" cars 

- defined as vehicles that have over 150 
horsepower - are outlawed, except in 

cases of a demonstrated "need" for. such 
high-powered engines. Because long-dis-
tance driving contributes 30 percent of the 
total vehicular fatalities, "capacity bans" 
are placed on fuel tanks, limiting cars to 
four-gallon fuel cells. "Sport cars," defined 
as vehicles with over 200 horsepower and 
limited cargo capacity, become completely 
outlawed, because nobody needs such ex-
cessive perfonnance 

Black markets develop. and high-perfor-
mance cars become associated with crimi-
nals, amplifying the negative perception 
people have of spons cars as dangerous and 
unfit for private citizens . 

Now, go back and replace the word 
"guns" every time you see the word "car" 
in the above scenario. Replace "magazine 
capacity" with "fuel tanks." "Spons cars" 
can be read as "assault rifles." 

In the Penn-and-Teller world of Ameri-
can public discourse, one of the most popu-
lar lies told to the American people is the

the number of gun-relaled crimes and accidents, 
and, for that reason alone, it is worth it 

Another fllalistic argument in the gun-
control debate is that people will be able to 
get guns anyway, so there's no need to attempt 
to control fireams. Criminals can obtain most 
illegal items, but that does not mean we should 
aid them in their pursuit. Criminals always 
steal cars, but we do not make it legal to do 
so. Similarly, we should attempt to keep guns 
away from criminals. Some effon is far bet-
ter than none.

their gun. around for 
their children to pia, with 
or for Intruden to u .. 
.,.Inatthem. The long-term success of gun control re-

lies on the type of legislation enacted. Present 
gun-control laws are ineffective, and should 
not be used as barometers for our potential to 
solve this crisis. As a first step, we should 
maintain - and significantly strengthen -
the licensing requirements for owning and 
purchasing a gun. Currently, all a prospective 
gun owner needs to do is pass an insignifi-
cant multiple-choice test, which hardly deter-
mines one's ability to operate a gun responsi-
bly. In its place, an extensive training and 
safety course ought to be required. Simulta-
neously, we should maintain the waiting pe-
riod for mandatory background checks. 

Some argue that guns are relatively simple 
to use, and that training courses can only teach 
so much. But the average American has proven 
that he cannot effectively handle a gun. For 
whatever reason, citizens continue to use guns 
in irresponsible ways: shooting family members, 
shooting themselves, and leaving their guns 
around for their children to play with or for in-
truders to use against them. Again, training 
courses wi II not weed out all the idiots, but they 
will help to limit the number of accidents. 

gun owner. Because most criminals don't pur-
chase their weapons legally, cracking down on 
legal possession will leave the crime rate largely 
unchanged. Legislation targeting criminals 
should be two-fold: tougher penalties for gun-
related crimes, and a severe limitation on the 
production and importation of guns. Many 
criminals are repeat offenders. Therefore, the 
solution is simple: Don't allow them any op-
ponunities to repeat. Longer and harsher sen-
tencing will reduce the number of murders, as-
saults, carjackings, burglaries and robberies sig-
nificantly. And if this requires more prisons, so 
be it. The fiscal cost to society will be well wonh 
the added safety on the streets. 

Still, new gun-control legislation must also 
address the criminal, in addition to the lawful 

Limiting the production or imponation of 
guns, at the same time, will also help reduce 
crime. If fewer guns are being manufactured 
domestically or imponed legally into the United 
States, criminals will eventually have a harder 
time obtaining them. A scarcity of guns will 
boost prices. keeping them out of the hands of 
peU)"criminals or junkies. This effort would 
certainly be a superior situation to giving up 
completely and making no effort to interfere 
with criminals' methods. Placing a cap on the 
number of guns a company can produce per

monh, taxing bigher production rates, requir-
ing extensive permits to produce guns and mak-
ing the necessary materials more difficult to pur_ 
chase will all help to lower the number of guns 
available. Naturally, these restrictions will not 
prevent a criminal from buying guns on the 
black market, but they will make it more diffi-
cult. And these restrictions will deter many 
people who aren't willing to pay more or in-
convenience themselves to buy weapons. 

Some people complain that effons to pre-. 
vent criminals from procuring guns come at 
too great a cost to law-abiding citizens. They 
correctly argue that harsher gun control re-
stricts the personal freedom of a majority of 
gun owners forthe crimes of a few. In a sense, 
this is true - after all, we live in a society, a 
social compact, and such arrangements re-
quire the sacrifice of some personal libenies 
and freedoms in exchange for the safety pro-
vided by a government through regulation and 
law-making. In order to protect the members 
of their community, gun owners must submit 
to a strictly regulated freedom to bear arms, 
so as to protect the rest of the community. 

Funhennore, opponents of gun control of-
ten complain that legislation will take the guns 

a limiting of their rights. 
Others also voice cOOcern about an infringe-

ment of Second Amendment rights. One must 
examine the Second Amendment in its proper 
context, however. Wilen this country was 
formed, a citizen militia would have stood a 
chance against our government's army. But to-
day, the strongest militia in the United States 
- with all the gun-power it could assemble _ 
would hardly stand a chance against any divi-
sion of the United Stales military. In other words. 
our ability to protect ourselves from the gov-
ernment doesn't depend on whether the gov-
ernment limits gun ownership or not. The gov-
ernment could still oppress the citizenry if it so 
chose. Governmental oppression is a risk every 
society takes in maintaining a large military. But 
it is a small, far-fetched risk at best. 

We must remember that gun control does not 
mean gun elimination. People will still be able 
to own guns and new legislation will neve~com­
pletely eradicate gun-related crimes. But be-
cause increased gun control does not come at 
any significant price to our freedom. it is clearly 
wonh the effort. A somewhat lower crime and 
accident rate is far beuer than allowing this dan-
gerous trend to continue.

hands and give them to 
criminals, thus leaving 
society largely defense-
less. But citizens will not 
be sacrificing their right 
to own guns; instead, 
they will be sacrificing 
the ease of buying guns 
in return for added safety. 
And while they may have 
to pay more for guns (due 
to lower production rates 
and higher taxes on pro-
duction), they will be 
paying a small price for

consequence to vehicular may-
hem. For all the argle-bargle about 
full-pOwer rifles cutting down mil-
lions of Americans, the truth is 
that they are used in less than two 
percent of all crimes, according to 
the 1987 FBI report on homicides 
and robberies. 

Gun owners are not surprised: 
Good military-grade rifles can 
easily cost over $1000, highly un-
practical for criminal use. When a 
cheap $50 pistol and a handful of 
bullets can be enough to equip a 
criminal for life. it is in fact the 
millions of legitimate firearms 
owners - and not criminals -
who are punished by restrictions 
on assault weapons. 

Gun control represents the 
brand of arrogance often found in 
most political circles -the brand 
of arrogance that suggests the ig-
norant masses don't know what 
they're doing, and that it is the 
mission of the enlightened elite to 
guide the populace from its other-
wise self-destructive behavior. If 
outright bans of firearms cannot 
diminish the crime rate, surely our 
attention ought to focus on the 
criminal, not the piece of metal in 
his hand,

GuldlnCllCht: eso Officer in Charge Garrett Williams escorts 
Marshall junior Tassia Loukas to her car last Thursday. 

The UCSD Guardian 

cso: Serving the 
campus community 
CGntInued from Pac. 1 

CSOs are trained in the use of 
police radio codes and police eti-
queUe, Williams said. He added 
that they not only carry radios, but 
also nash lights, breather masks 
and latex gloves. 

In addition, CSO Program Co-
ordinator Russ Reuther said the 
CSOs are trained in writing re-
ports, recognizing auto-theft at-
tempts and performing CPR. 

Reuther explained that when 
hiring individuals as CSOs, some 
of the attributes he looks for are 
integrity, honesty and good judg-
ment. 

"There are no prerequisites for 
this job," he said. "We find out if 
[applicants) have criminal records 
and about their driving records. 
We look for anything that would 
not be conducive to employment 
in the police department." 

Williams, who said he became 
a CSO because he wanted to give 
back to the community, explained 
that the hiring process involves an 

interview, a background check and 
a 32-hour training period. 

OIC David Stark, who has 
worked as a CSO for over one 
year, said he also became a eso to 
help the community and that he 
hopes to one day work for the 
Secret Service. 

Both OICs said the job is very 
nexible to the needs of student 
CSOs. If a student is too busy to 
work because of academics, the 
OIC on dUly finds someone else to 
take over their shift. 

"School work, in my opinion, 
is most impvl lant," Williams saiel. 

He added that the job provides 
the experience of working with 
others, while also benefiting the 
individual personally. 

CSO Ian Hayden, a Roosevelt 
senior, said he joined the program 
because it is sensitive to the needs 
of the students and because "it 
beats pUlling papers into alpha-
betical files ." 

"Another reason I'm doing this , 
besides the economic factor, is that 
I have a little sister and a girl-
friend , and I think about them 
walking around the campus alone 
at night," Hayden said

"I {WOUld] feel a lot beller if 
there [were] someone who could 
just walle. with them," he added. 

Hayden, who has been working 
as a CSO since October, describes 
the CSO program as a type of 
"community policing where we all 
look out for each'other." Accord-
ing to Hayden, there is a feeling of 
camaraderie among the officers. 

"They hire a wide range of 
people and, amazingly, not only 
do we get along professionally, 
but we all have a good time to-
gether," Hayden said. 

Williams said that CSOs are 
respqnsible for one another and 
work together as a team. 

"rr one CSO is closer 10 a re-
quested escort than another, he or 
she will generally say, 'Hey, I'm 
closer; I can handle it for you,'" he 
said. 

Warren senior Lila Reading, 
one of the seven female esos, 
said that many women she meets 
do not even realize that there are 
women CSOs, adding that when 
she escorts females , they are usu-
ally surprised.

OSD officials praised the use

In addition, the program offers

The AMC Mission 
Valley 20, one of the 

nation's largest 
theaters, redefines 
the movie-going 

experience 

An immense multiplex, adorned 
with lowering canvas tarps, painted 
in tannish-yellow, blue and red. It 
contains 4,466 seals, 32 concession 
stands and 10 box -office stations, 
while covering 76,343 square feet 
and employing nearing 300 work-

ers. By the numbers, it sounds like a description of 
Disneyland, or maybe even Jack Murphy Stadium. Not 
so. The behemoth in question is the AMC Mission 
Valley 20, one of the largest movie Ihealers in the 
country. 

After surveying the above gargantuan facility, after 
marveling at the sheer magnitudeoftl1is larger· than-life 
"cinemapolis," I can attesl it's unlike any movie thealer 
around. You don' t just see a flick here. You experience 
it. 

It may sound corny 10 describe a movie theater in 
such tenns, but anyone whovisitsthis facilily-anyone 
who has truly witnessed ils enonnous, unparalleled 
neon glory - will realize that the AMC 20 defies any 
run-of-the-mill description. The only way to describe it 
with justice is to constantly use synonyms for the word 
" large." 

What is it really like to vi it this state-of-the·art si te? 
There was only one way,to findoul. It wa an unenviable 
task the Guardian assigned me. but one I knew I had to 
undertake. Simply put, I had to walch a lot of movies. 

And after conducting exhaustive interviews of a 
manager, an usher and several patrons -- and, of course,

Arriving at the theater 

With 20 theaters crammed inlo one faci lity, you 'd 
expect parking to be a helli sh affair, much like fans 
pouring oul of a stadium after a sporting event. But 
Senior Manager Albert Santana said the advent of the 
MY 20 hasn't precipitated any significant parking dif-
ficulties. 

Thanks 10 the Mission Valley Center's extensive 
underground lot, finding parking is no chore at all. In 
fact, parking there is a lot like parking at the Sea World 
- it 's so big that it is divided into wnes, identified by 
seafaring creatures. I parked in the Killer Whale Zone. 
(Remembering where I parked was another story). 

After parking, you can't really miss the licket office. 
The front of the theater is illuminated by numerous 
computer-programmed signs and the words "AMC 20 
Theaters," which are emblazoned above in gaudy neon 
lettering. The ticket office lies in front of a large 
courtyard. The whole area is covered by broad canvas 
tarps suggesting sails - a motif which continues inside 
the cinema. 

At first glance, the line at the ticket office can appear 
intimidating, especially if you're buying tickets around 
the peak houn. ThanIts to die multiple ticket windows,

WHY CAN'T WE JUST 
WRITE A CHECK? 

Fraternity and sorority 
advisors across the country 
struggle to engage their 
student leaders in service 
learning. Many witness 
chapters raise money through 
large philanthropy events held 
on campus involving other 
chapters, write a check, and 
then put the n otebook away 
until planning for the 
following year begins. 
Fra ternity and sorority leaders 
claim that their organiza tions 
are about service and giving 
back to the community. Do 
they truly give of themselves 
an d of their ch apter when they 
merely write that check? 
While our students typ ically 
perceive they have met their 
philanthropic mission, there is 
a strong debate as to the way 
in which this type of service 
contributes to the personal 
growth of members. 
Lead ers in 1996 must be

into their daily lives. The 
fraternity and sorority 
experience provides an 
excellent framework fro this 
critical learning process to 
begin and develop. When we 
only have the students for just 
four, five and sometimes six 
years, our educational efforts in 
the area of service learning 
must not only be deliberate, 
they must be on the forefront 
of our work as educators and 
leaders. At a time when 
service learning programs are 
becoming kind of vogue, there 
is no better time to seize the 
opportunity to challenge 
students and make that cri tical 
conversion. 
In recent times, society has 
asked for a renewed focus on 
the developmen t of responsible 
citizenship. Individuals as 
powerful as the President of 
the Uni ted States have made 
the appeal for mandatory 
national service in our youth. 
Some argue that the perceived 
lack of civic minded ness is not 
founded in reality. Others w iJI 
counter this notion and insist 

that the time is right to 
seriously consider how 
institutions of higher 
education can influence, in 
meaningful ways, a students' 
values and their commitment 
to a humane society. Student 
affairs professionals and 
specifically, those working 
with fraternity and sorority 
chapters, have a true 
resp onsibility to incorporate 
values into the co-curricular 
activ ity of their student 
lead ers. Regard less of the 
obstacles we face when 
promoting va lues, are indeed 
many . 
Through our work, we must 
be concerned about student 
ou tcomes. When students use 
thei r in-class experiences to 
inform and understand an 
individua l or community 
being served, there is 
collaboration and growth. In 
turn, students become better 
informed by the individual or 
community as to their needs, 
concerns, history and culture.

is educated and develops a 
deeper sense of civic 
responsibility and the served 
(our community) is 
empowered. It is also essential 
that our students begin to shift 
from a primary focus on self to 
an increased focus on others. 
From a student development 
perspective, this outcome is 
essential in that here, we 
prepare individuals for 
continuing citizenry and 
provide for the recognition of 
care as a universal obligation. 
The latter is an essential 
component of values 
education. When we 
incorporate values education

the development of a more

SPIKED: UCSD was unable to topple either of-the two Division I powers 
that visited La Jolla this weekend, as UOP and Stanford emerged victorious 
IfD_ KNIt 
Sports Editor 

Despite lookin, u if they could 
play with Stanford and the Uni-
versity of Pacific: Iut weekend, 

the Tritons came 
away from their Fri-
day-Saturday set 
empty- handed. 

UCSD played 
well against the Ti-
gers and the Cardi-
nal - both high-
powered Division I 

squads - in the opening game of 
each contest, but. eventually fell to 
pieces in the face of the superior 
physical presences staring through 
the net atthem. 

On Friday night against Pacific, 
the collapse occurred nearthecon-
clusion of each game, rather than 
at some point during the match. 
The opening set of the contest was 

all Tisen early on, but UCSD made 
a valiant c:hallense. 

The Tritons trailed by scores 
of 6-1 and IJ-S before mountina a 
comeback which narrowed the 
score to 14-10 and eventually 14-
13. However, with the pressure 
on, Pacific rose to the occasion, 
spiking home point number I S with 
UCSD charging fast . 

Game two was a close game 
throughout, as the combatants 
found themselves knotted at eight, 
10 and I r. But once again the Ti-
gers came up big at game's end, 
reeling off the final four points of 
the set to win it 15-11 and to take 
a secure 2-0 lead in the contest. 

The final game of the match 
saw the shaken Triton team falter 
early, allowing Pacific to sprint 
out to a 9-3 advantage. Poor pass-
ing by UCSD enabled the Tigers 
to score points too easily, as Pa-

cific built its cushion. 
However, the youtbful Trilons 

showed no quit, as they marched 
back, spurred on by the fiery bel-
lows of captain Tom Black. 

Blaclt, who tallied a team-high 
27 kills in the match, led with his 
enthusiasm in the crucial stages of 
game three. Heculminatedtherally 
by setting a nice ball, which sopho-
more Matt Riley pounded past the 
defense to knot the score at II. 

On the very next poin •• Black 
crushed a kill past the Tigers on an 
outside set by junior Satao Minami 
to give UCSD its second lead or 
the match . 

It was short-lived, howevcr, as 
UOP again played big in the late 
going, winning four of the next 
five points to take the game, 15-
13. 

Black feels thai much or 
UCSD's trouble late in games 
stems from inexperience and lack 
of confidence. 

"A lot of it iscolliidence," Black 
said. "We cracked at 10-10 in the 
second game. That 's where the bet-
ter team's win. Everybody is re-
ally going hard out there, it's just 
a maller of experience." 

That experience will come with 
time, but the question is, will it be 
enough to enable the Tritons to 
topple the physically bigger and 
stronger teams from Division I 
s<:hools? Black feels it will be. 

"You can overcome anything. 
We're not so bad physically Ihat 
we can't overcome that," Black 
said. "If you're siding-out consis-
tently, then you're goinS to get 
your chances. That's how you can 
beat teams that are better [physi-
cally] then you." 

Siding-outconsistently isjustone 
of the many things that UCSD wun 't 
able to do against Saanford on Satur-
day night. To the Tritons' credit, 
they hung tough with the biS boys 
from up nonh in game one; how-
ever, sames two and three were over 
almost before they began. 

The opening set saw UCSD force 
the Cardinal to work for its eventual 
15-11 win. The Tritons managed to 
sidcout effectively (32 sideouts) and 
drag the same out to a 3~minute 
affair. However, Stanford prevailed 
and the wind was abruptly knocked 
from the UCSD squad's collective 
stomach. 

The Cardinal declared war on 
the Triton defense in ,ames two 
and three, as they bombed away 
with nary a UCSD response in 
sight. The huge Stanford frontline, 
consisting of four men over 6'8" 
(the Tritons' largest is freshman 
Devon Jeffcoat, who stands 6'6") 
dominated the net, forcins even 
the usually unflappable Black to 
commit 17 hillin, erron.

UCSD's solid core of

in the water. Freshmen Kelly Byrne 
and Sarah Chu started it off by 
finishing 1-2 in the 100 breast with 
times or I :08.64 and I :08.95, re-
spectively. 

That dynamic duo repeated their 
1-2 finish again in the 200 breast,

came across in a swift 2:29.48. 

That wasn't Monroe's best per-

The UCSD Guardian SPORTS IS 

Crusaders Out· Point Tritons, 89·85 
MISFIRE: With inside scorer Matt Aune faltering, UCSD couldn't find enough offense to win 
If.ike'taIC-
Staff Writer 

Players are going to suffer an off night 
every once in a while in the wild world of 
sports. Triton center Matt Aune endured just 

that on Thursday evening, as 
UCSD fell to local foe Point 
Loma Nazarene College, 89-
85. 

Aune has been leading the 
Tritons with an average of 20 
points and 10 rebounds pergarne. 
He suuggled to score against the 

_,;;;0=_ Crusaders, however, shooting an 
abysmal three for 17 from the floor and finishing 
with a season low of six points. 

Despite Aune' s shooting woes, Ihe Tritons 
were in the game in the final minutes. UCSD 
led by three points with two minutes remain· 
ing, but Point Loma came storming back. 

"It just caved in at the end," Head Coach 
Greg Lanthier said. "We gave up too many 
easy baSkets. You can't do that when you play 
a team that's supposed to be at a higher level 
and expect to win." 

Crusader guard Jason Mackenzie poured 
in a career-high 29 points and hil his sixth 
three-pointer of the night with I :30 left in the 
game to put the N AlA squad from Point Lorna 
ahead to stay, 85-82. 

UCSD had hosted, but did not play, Point 
Lorna Nazarene in November at tlie Triton 
Tip-Off Tournament. 

"They were a lot different team [on Thurs-
day]," Lanthier said. 'They had two kids 
eligible for the second semester that were 
Mall Aune's size." 

Point Loma's front court tandem of 6' 7" 
center Chad Urie and 6'6" forward Tim Rogers 
were a combined nine of II from the floor. 

'1'hey were able to give [Aune] some 
problems inside," Lanthier said. "If we would 
have seen the same people we saw in the Tip-
Off, we would have crushed them." 

The Tritons demonstraled an ability to put 
points on the board even when their big gun 
was misfiring. Aune's teammates picked up 
the offensive slack, as five Tritons finished 
with double figures in scoring. 

Freshman forward Mike Wall pacecj 

UCSD's attack with 18 points and kept UCSD 
in the game with his four three-point baskets. 

Senior forward Mall Minehan also had a 
big game for UCSD, pulling down a team-
high II rebounds to go with his 15 poinl~ . 

"[Minehan] played really well," Lanthier 
said. "Actually, everyone played well. Aune 
didn't shoot the ball very well, bur I think the 
team played a good game." 

Among the other Triton conLributors was 
point guard Adam Libby, who scored 15 points 
and dished out seven assists. 

Mike Ensley cashed in on Libby's passes, 
knocking down all five of his shot attempts to 
finish with 10 points. 

"Wilh Jason Barnes and Jason Jones out, 
[Ensleyl gets more ofanopponunity to play," 
Lanthier said. "He's taking advantage of his 
chance." 

Barnes had surgery last week to repair a 
light tear of the meniscus in his right knee and 
will miss the rest oflhe year. Jones is listed as 
day to day. The Tritons hope to have the 
explosive guard healthy soon as their road 
swing continues this weekend against Menlo.

18 SPORTS The UCSD Guardian 

Tritons Avenge Loss to NCA 
BUILDING: UCSD continued to improve its times with the Pacific Coast Swim 
Championships in mind, beating a young squad from the North Coast Aquatics Club 
., D .. Kreft 
Sports Editor 

Oh, wha18difference two months make. 
When the UCSD swimming team took on 
a youthful group from the North Coast 

Aquatics Club (NCA) last 
November, the future Divi-
sion I strokers from NCA 
beat both the Triton men and 
women. 

Last Saturday was a dif-
ferent story, however. 

The UCSD squad - two 
months more seasoned, 

drilled and finely tuned - enacted a mea-
sure of revenge by capturing victories on 
both the men's and the women's sides of 
the pool. 

The men, who fell to NC,A by a narrow 
62-60 margin in the inaugural meeting, 
cruised to a 73-49 triumph. 

The score doesn't reflect the ease with 
which the Tritons disposed of the compe-
tition, however. The shorthanded men's 
team was unable to swim the final few 
events for scores, but maintained its sub-
stantial cushion nonetheless. 

That cushion was constructed by the 
hard work of Mike Jefferson, among oth-
en. The senior, and six-time ali-Ameri-
can, recorded lifetime (unshaven) best 
times in both the 200-yard freestyle 
(1:"8.54) and the 200 individual medley 

(2:00.~1). 

......... Ip: Senior co-captain Carrie Parker was named swimmer of the meet by 
coach Boyd for her solid performances in the 100 and 200 freestyle races. 

performance in the 100 free, which he won 
in 49.20. 

Pellow senior Kaley Parkinson had a 
fun-filled day in the water as well. 
Parkinson screamed to a speedy 22.5 I in 
the 50 freestyle and returned for an encore 

Other standouts for UCSD included 
sophomore Tim McAtccr - who swam a 
solid time of 4:52.93 in the 500 free - and 
Mike Yen, whose time of 55.41 in the 100 
buuerfly was a lifetime besl. 

The women avenged their 67·46 defeat

at the hands of NCA in November with a 
solid 69·53 victory. They were led by swim-
mer-of-the-mcct, senior Carrie Parker. The 
co-captain and 21-time all-American 
showed the talent thai earned her such 
accolades by taking first place in the 100 
(54.33) and 200 (I :56.44) freestyle races.

COACH: UCSD will 
have to replace Dannevik 
ContIRued from ,... 20 

~I that I can make I. living doing. [UCSD 
Head Golfing Coach Mike] Wydra has given 
me a lot of help and advice." 

Dannevik will, however, remain at UCSD 
as head coach of the men's volleyballleam, 
which competes in the rigorous Mountain 
Pacific Sports Federation, which includes 
Division I. n and ill schools. 

".Iike the challenge ofb"uilding our men' s 
program to the point where it is competitive 
with [Division I] schools," Dannevik said. 

The women's program, on the other hand, 
will be forced to replace Dannevik, who was 
a fixture not only at UCSD, but in Division III 
women's volleyball as well. Dannevik's Tri-
tons won the first ever Division III women's 
vo II e'y ball title in 1981 and continued a trend 
of success in the years that followed. 

Under Danne vik, UCSD captured fi ve more 
national crowns, finished runner-up fourtimes 
and advanced 10 the national semifinals a 
record II times in 15 seasons. 

''The thing J'm most proud of is our 1981 
tille," Dannevik said. "No body thought UCSD 
was capable of winning national champion-
ships and we really changed thaI." 

". was able to give the program much more 
time then, and our success in the 80s was 
relative to the time I spent," Dannevik ex-
plained. "But in the last five years, Ijust didn't 
have the time for thaI. Hopefully, [UCSD] 
will be able to find someone that can give the 
excitementtothis program that I haven't been 
able to muster." 

1be Tritons' hope oi finding a replace-
ment may rest in the hands of UCSD students, 
who will vote on a referendum authorizing 
better salaries to coaches in the next election. 

"That referendum will determine the tal-
ent pool from which a new coach can be 
selected," Dannevik said.

MIRACLE FINISH: The Tritons managed to pull out a victory over Point 
Lorna, when Pam Contini hit a IO-footer with one second on the clock 
By Robin Kezlrlen 
Staff Writer 

A game decided in the fir,al 
seconds is often either the most 
disappointing defeat or the sweet-

est victory of a 
team's season. 

The UCSD 
women's basketball 
team experienced 
the latter last Thurs-
day night, pulling 
off a last-second vic-
tory over a deter-

mined squad from Point Loma 
Nazarene College. 

Forty minutes of all-out effort 
came down to one shot, one sec-
ond before the final buzzer. Junior 
guard Pam Contini sunk it, claim-
ing the win for the Tritons, 68-66. 

UCSD, still suffering from ill -
ness and fatigue from its East Coast 
road trip, seemed unaffected in the 
first half. 

The aggressive defense of 
, UCSD forward Karli Jungwirth 

and center Summer Begley dis-
rupted Point Loma's post-oriented 
offensive strategy. Jungwirth's 
stellar performance amounted to 
18 points, 15 rebounds and fi ve 
assists . 

Begley also contributed to the 
Triton's first-half offensive surge, 
posting 10 points. 

Shooting guard Marcia Jeffries 
was a major factor in the Triton's 
victory. Jeffries dished off suc-
cessfully six times and tallied 15 

points, including two of three from 
three-point range. 

"We worked really well to-
gether," Jeffries said. "Everything 
seemed to fall." 

UCSD took the court in the sec-
ond half with a seemingly com-
fortable 40-27 lead, but the tide 
suddenly turned against the Tri-
tons. 

"They had more energy than 
we did in the second half," 
Jungwirth explained. "We were 
playing without Sarah [Schneider] 
and Tianna [Mirage], so our posts 
were tired." 

Point Loma took advantage of 
UCSD's fatigue, running the ball 
and beating the Tritons down the 
court on fast breaks. Unable to 
match Point Lorna's pace, the 
UCSD lead quickly dwindled in 
the contest's late going. 

"We just focused on geuing 
back on the break and using the 

clock to our advantage, since we 
were ahead," Jeffries said . 

But Point Loma was within two 
when, with 19 seconds remaining, 
the Crusaders drove down the court 
and sank a jumper to tie the game 

at 66. 
UCSD then dug deep and found 

what it took to triumph. The Tri-
tons hurriedly in-bounded the ball 
and cleared half court before tak-
ing a timeout to gather their com-
posure. 

With 12 seconds to play', UCSD 
got the ball in and passed it around 
the perimeter. The ball ultimately 
found its way to Contini, who was 
open on the right side. She pulled 
up and sunk a I O-footjumper with 
only one tick left on the clock. 

The Tritons mobbed Contini in 
celebration of the 68-66 victory. 

"It was one of the toughest 
games of the season," Jeffries said. 

"The game was mentally chal-
lenging," Jungwirth agreed. "We 
couldn't let ourselves give up." 

The women's basketball team 
returns to RIMAC Arena tomor-
row night when it faces Southern 
California College-at 7 p.m. With 

hopes of return-
ing to the NCAA 
Regional , how-
ever, the Tritons 
cannot afford to 
be content with 
their 13-5 
record. 

"We defi -
nitely have a chance, but we have 
to step up our level of play toward 
the end of the season," Jeffries 
said. "[Late season] games are 
tough to win, especially when ev-
eryone is out to beat you ."

Dannevik Says' Adios' to Women's Post 
RESIGNAnON: Doug Dannevik, who has been the head UCSD women's volleyball coach for 17

By D .. Kreft 
Sports Editor 

Last weekend, in a move that 
came as no surprise to those in the 
know in the UCSD sporting com-
munity, Doug Dannevik resigned 
his post as head coach of the UCSD 
women's volleyball team - a ~si­

It was an announcement which 
made official what Dannevik had 
been discussing with UCSD 
Athletic Director Judy Sweet 
since the conclusion of the 
women's team's season in 
late November. 

". just don't have enough 
energy for both programs any 
longer," Dannevik said. ''I'm 
engaged to be married next 
spring, and it's time 'for me to stan 
thinking 'about a family and finan-
cial security." 

According to Dannevik, head 
coaches at UCSD make as little as 

$10,000 a year, staning oul. 
Veteran coaches·can earn as 
much as $20,000, he said. 

"I was able to give much 
more time to the job in the 
1980s than the salary dictated, 
and our success beared that 
out," Dannevik said. "When 
I first started here in 1978, I 

made $980 a year. In the spring, 
when. started coaching the men, I 
made a whopping $2,000." 

It wasn't money that kept the 
veteran coach at home on the cam-
pus ofUCSD. 

"Now is just the right timing for 
me to seek another, lets sayan 'ad-
ditional', career," Dannevik said. 

That caree( will be as a golfing 
pro, and it will begin when he takes 
an apprenticeship at the Torrey Pines 
Golf Course in the off-season. 

"I have played golf since I was in 
high school," Dannevik said. "It's 
something that I really enjoy, and
