Faculty mull new changes to 
'Admission by Exception' 

By MAlNETTE FEDERIS 
Senior Staff Writer 

As part of its regular review 
of admission polic.ies, the UCSD 
Academic Senate's Admissions 
Committee is considering expand-
ing a special existing program that 
allows high school students to be 
admitted to UC campuses even 
though they do not meet the min-
imum eligibility requirement. 

The proposal , which has not 
yet been finalized, would allow 
high school principals to nominate 
students for participation in the 
program. If the selected students 
perform well once they are at 
UCSD, the high school principals 
would be allowed to make more 
recommendations. The proposal 
would not affect more than I per-
cent of all admitted students, with 
peci fi details yet to be released. 

"We are trying to see if [we] 
can improve the admissions sys-
tem slowly by learning about 
applicants from people who can 
supply information that currently 
is not incorporated in the scor- . 
ing system," Academic Senate 
Admissions Committee Chair and 
sociology professor Alcos Rona-
Tas said. 

In a trial of the program, the 
committee will incorporate new 
information they collect from a 
student's high school principal and 
evaluate it along with the current 

formulized scoring system as part 
of the admission process. This will 
not, however, guarantee an admis-
sion for the students picked by the 
principals. 

"This experiment is to see if we 
can admit underprivileged appli-
cants who would not be admitted 
under the current scoring sy tern 
but who would prosper here at 
UC D nevertheles ," Rona-Tas 
aid . "Some of these may be stu-

dents who are UCSD-ready but 
fail the test of UC eligibility. In 
those cases, we will use our license 
under 'Admissions by Exception' 
to admit them." 

U administrators currently 
use a "comprehensive review" 
admission process, which consid -
ers 13 factors about applicallts and 
assigns points to each category. 

dmi~sion by Exception is used 
for students with situations that 
the system cannot anticipate. For 
example, home-schooled students 
would receive further review of 
their applications to make sure the 
classes they have taken are equiva-
lent to those of other students. 
In some cases, the method is also 
used to admit athletes and musi-
cians who do not qualify under the 
traditional UC eligibility guide-
lines. 

According to Rona-Tas, while 
the comprehensive review is a sys-
tem meant to be rigid and formu-
laic, there is a necessity to contin-

ually review it for improvements. 
Last year alone, out of more 
than 32,000 applicants to the UC 
system, 4,000 were .set aside for 
further review and for possible 
consideration in the Admission 
by Exception pool. Currently, the 
review includes asking for addi-
tional information direct from the 
individual student. 

"We need to leave room for 
experimentation to see if we can 
improve the system," Rona-Ta 
said. "The program stands right 
now a a way of treating excep-
tional cases that cannot be treated 
by the current system - there are 
alway cases where you cannot fit 
in or there is an error with the 
applicatIOn." 

At UCSD, 12 students, or les 
than 1 percent, were accepted by 
exception last ~car. According 
to Assistant Vice Chancellor of 
Admissions and Enrollment 
Services Mae W. Brown, students 
that have been accepted through 
the program were home-schooled 
or took classes through study-
abroad programs. 

"One particular case was a stu-
dent who went to a study abroad 
program for high school students 
and missed a second semester of 
foreign language classes," Brown 
said. "And that's an example of 
how [UCSD) has used Admission

Judge extends UC fee injundion 
Regents consider hike to offset lost revenue 

By VLADIMIR KOGAN 
News Editor 

Late last month, the presid-
ing San Francisco Superior Court 
judge extended an order that blocks 
approximately $3.5 million in new 
fees for some students enrolled 
in the University of California's 
professional schools, protracting a 
nearly three-year-long legal saga. 

If the legal proceedings contin-
ue next year, the legal injunction 
that was first instituted last August 
will have cost the university more 
than $22 million in lost revenue. 

The extended injunction covers 

approximately 3,100 current stu-
dents attending a UC professional 
school, like those that award law 
and medical degrees, according 
to UC Office of the President 
spokeswoman Ravi Poorsina. At 
UCSD, it will affect approximately 
120 medical and pharmacy seniors 
who were enrolled in the univer-
sity in December 2002, when the 
class action lawsuit was first filed. 

"Their professional degree 
fees cannot be raised above the 
amount that they were charged in 
[2003-04)," said Andrew Freeman, 
a partner at the Baltimore-based 
law firm representing the students.

"The larger piece of the case is 
that the university promised pro-
fessional degree students that their 
fee would remain the same through 
their years [of instruction]. It's a 
promise that they had made for 
years and continued to make." 

In their 2002 filing, the stu-
dents pointed to the university's 
promotional material that suggest-
ed that their fees would stay flat 
during their entire period of study, 
a statement they claim constituted 
a binding contract. However, the 
university has maintained that the 
notices in the catalog were old and 
that updated statements on the 
UC Web site at the time waived 
the fee guarantees. 

Last summer, San Francisco 
Superior Court Judge James L. 
Warren ruled that the students 
"demonstrated a substantiallikeli-
hood of success" in the case and 
issued an order that prevented the 
university from instituting increas-
es of a\)Qut $5,000 for each of the

Pell Grants likely · to fall 
next year, GAO reports 

By SHANNON ELIOT 
Senior Staff Writer 

More than a third of the more 
than five million low-income stu-
dents who qualify for Pell Grants 
will see a decrease in their 2005-
06 grant awards, while an addi-
tional 81,000 applicants will lose 
their aid altogether, according to a 
new report from the Government 
Accountability Office. 

The report is an updated version 
of one put forth by GAO in January, 
which discussed effects that the 
U.S. Departinent of Education's 
recent update of state tax calcula-
tions used in financial aid formulas 
have on student awards. Prior to 
2004, the state and other tax allow-
ance was based on 1988 tax data. 
The new tax tables, which take into 
account lower state taxes, translate 
into higher take-home income. 

Higher income calculations cor-
respond to an increase in the esti -
mated family contribution to the 
cost of education, and a subsequent 
decrease in Pell Grant eligibility. 

GAO conducted the report at 
the request of Rep. David Obey 
(D-Wisc.), who sought evidence of 
how the changes would affect the 

Pell Grant awards. 
"Education 's 2004 upd ate 

decreases the sta te and other tax 
allowance for most states for the 
2005-2006 award year and will , 
thereby, increase the estimated fam -
ily contribution for a majority of 
student-aid applicants; the increase 
in expected family contribution 
will, in turn, affect the allocation 
of federal aid," GAO Director of 
Education, Workforce and Income 
Security Issues Cornelia M. Ashby 
stated in the analysis. 

The report found that 21 per-
cent of California students receiving 
aid would see their grant amount 
decrease compared to 36 percent 
on a national level. The average 
dollar decrease for California stu-
dents is also lower, at $86, com-
pared with the national average 
drop of $131. Tho e Californians 
eligible for an increase will see an 
additional $209, compared with a 
national average increase of $443 
for the country. Collectively, Pell 
Grant expenditures will be cut by 
about $250 million. 

Wisconsin and Massachusetts 
will be hardest hit by the reforms,

Fee: New increase targets 
professional students 

conLin ued from page I 
spring, disagreement over techni-
calities have pushed the expected 
ruling date to late summer. 

If the case drags on past then, 
the April extension will ensure 
that the affected students will 
not face fee increases already 
approved and those currently 
under consideration by the UC 
Board of Regents for next year. 

"¥ou can never tell with the 
courts how long these things are 
going to take," said Mo Kashmiri, 
a former student at UC Berkeley's 
Boalt School of Law who was the 
first plaintiff to sign on to the 
suit. "We're not really in a hurry 
because we have an injunction." 

Kashmiri now works as an 
organizer for the UC Student 
Association . 

However, for students who 
continue their studies next year, 
the most recent legal action may 
not necessarily offer them protec-
tion from higher fees. 

In response to the case, uni-
verSIty auministrators have asked 
the regents to sidestep the court's 
order by a pproving new fees at 
therr Illeetrng later this month . 
Though the in junction covers 
"professional fees" - a surcharge 
that appJr es to UC graduate 
chools focu ing on career pe-

cralties - the university ha pro-
posed raising the general tuition, 
o r "educatio n fee," which is not 
covered by the order. 

T he $ 1,050 increase would 
apply 10 all students at the univer-
sity's professional schools - even 
those not covered by the injunc-
tion - and recoup most of the 
lost revenue over the next two 
years. University administrators 
have urged the regents to approve 
the new fees regardless of the rul-
ing in the case. 

"Even if the university ulti-
mately prevails in the litigation ... 
at the end of this current term, the 
majority of the students who have 
benefited from the injunction pro-

hibiting collection of fee increases 
for 2004-05 and 2005-06 will have 
graduated, and it will be very diffi-
cult to collect the revenue at a later 
date," the Office of the President 
stated in documents prepared for 
the May Board of Regents meet-
ing. "Therefore, it is prudent to 
consider an acrion at this time that 
will address the estimated shortfall 
of $22.5 million in professional 
school fee revenue related to the 
injunction .• 

Combined with recent state 
cuts, the lost revenue has caused 
faculty salaries at the professional 
schools to fall 10 percent behind 
those at similar institutions, and 
the university has been unable to 
provide adequate financial aid to 
the neediest students, the docu-
ments stated. 

"This revenue is essential to 
maintaining the quality of the 
academic programs and student 
setvices, and to sustaining enroll-
ment because professional school 
fee revenue . .. provides significant 
support to the base operating bud-
getS of the profes ional chools," 
the regents' brief stated . 

The unive rsity 'S precarious 
financial position, which precipi-
tated the original fee hikes at the 
heart of the case, has been caused 
by broader state reductions in high-
er education funding, according to 
David . Bailey, the deputy dean 
of UCSD chool of Medicine. 

"Remember why we're in a 
financial bind : In the governor's 
budget that was approved, there 
was a 25-percent cut in fund-
ing for the professional schools," 
Bailey said. "Basically, we 're run-
ning without state money." 

Should the students prevail, 
the university would have to 
repay more than $30 million in 
back fees for hikes instituted after 
fall 2002 but before the injunc-
tion came into effect last year.

Item B 

The council passed a reso-
lution supporting the current 
North Campus Housing Project, 
which would provide living 
accommodations for transfer stu-
dents. According to the resolu-
tion, transfer students are at II 
disadvantage in their sea rch for 
off-campus housi ng due to the 
timing of admission decisions. 

ombined with the decreasing 
availability of housing due to con-
dominium conversions, the council 
urged the UC Board of Regents to 

increase the campus' debt capacity 
by $110 million in order to guar-
antee the completion of the project 
by the current 2009 deadline. 

ItemE 
The council allocated a total 

of $906.50 to the various col-
lege councils due to the increased 
enrollment for spring quarter. The 
2004-05 A.S. budget required the 
council to contribute 50 cents per 
student per quarter to the college 
councils to fund the setvices that 
colleges provide to their students. 

Item] 
The council passed a resolu-

tion in conjunction with the UC 
Student Association supporting 
proposed changes to the UC Code 
of Conduct that would prohibit 
the University of California from 
licensing companies that do not 
allow their workers to unionize. 

The resolution calls on the 
university to investigate suspected 
violations of the code of conduct 
by licensees and to terminate the 
contracts if the company is deemed 
to be in violation of the code.

I BRIEFLY 
Judge in fee lawsuit 

offers recusal 
The San Francisco judge assigned 

to rule on the student dass action 
lawsuit that calls for a repeal of recent 
University of Califomia fee hikes has 
announced his intention to step down 
from the case. Citing personal conflict 
of interest. Superior Court Judge Curtis 
EA Kamow said he would disqualify 
himse~ unless both parties in the case 
agree to formally allow him to stay on. 

Up until mid-March, Kamow was 
a partner at a San Francisco law firm 
that also represented the UC system, 
putting his impartiality in question. 

"I am disqualified from hearing this 
case since that entity was a dient of 
my former law finn; Kamow stated in 
his order. "I do not recall representing 
the [UC Board o~ Regents mysele 

Earlier this month, he was assigned 
to hear the motions in the class action 
by the presiding ,·udge. The suit asks 
the courts to rol back most of the 
fees enacted by the university since 
2002, calling them a violation of an 
implicit contract over student fees. 

According to Andrew Freeman, 
one of the attomeys representing the 
students, a judge will probably decide 
the case. 

"It is conceivable - it is not impos-
sible - that there will be some ques-
tion for the jury to decide,· he said. 

Though the students' attomeys 
have offered to hold settlement talks, 
the university "has not indicated 
that it was interested; according to 
Freeman. 

UC Office of the President spokes-
woman Ravi Poorsina declined to 
speak on the possibility of a settle-
ment. 

"Any discussion of settlement is 
confidential, and the university will not 
comment," she stated in an e-mail.

Study: Valium works 
for amoeba, too 

In a surprise finding, UCSD 
researchers have found evidence 
that the popular sedative drug Valium 
exhibits the same effects on a specific 
species of social amoeba as it does 
on humans. 

Explaining their findings in a study 
published tIlis week, the researchers 
condude that Valium, along wi(h a "nat-
ural Vatium" protein found in human 
brains, causes the amoeba to enter a 
dormant or "sleep" phase. The findings, 
they said, might expand understanding 
about how Cells in higher organisms

Research targets fuel 
cell technology 

In a n{;W paper, researchers at UC 
Riverside have unveiled a method 
they say can help'reduce the amount 
of platinum used to develop fuel cells, 
something that promises to make the 
zero-emission energy source more 
practical for commercial reproduction. 

The work focuses on the use 
of carbon nanotubes - microscopic 
tubes that are about 10,000 times 
thinner than a single human hair - to 
replace the current need for much of 
the platinum in fuel cell production. 

~ adopted, the pradice would make 
fuel cells far cheaper to produce.

THlIl\S(MY, MAY 19,2005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

GAO: Politics played role in grant debate 
continued from page f 

wi th 80 'and 81 percent of stu-
dents seeing a decrease in their 
eligibility, respectively. New Jersey 
will see only I percent of its stu-
dents with higher expected family 
contributions, while overall num-
bers in Connecticut will remain 
unchanged. 

Other financial aid programs, 
such as Stafford and P.L.U.S . 
Loans, will also be affected by 
the changes. The analysis shows 
that those with an annual income 
of more than $25,000 are most 
likely to have their Stafford Loan 
amounts decreased. 

The issue of tax table updates 
and reduced financial aid awards 
has proved a partisan debate. 

Former Chairman of the House 
Committee on Education and the 
Workforce John Boehner (R-Ohio) 
has been a backer of the chang-
es, pointing to evidence that the 
changes will result in higher aid 
for students in the lowest income 
brackets. 

"The Bush administrati on is fol -
lowing the law by updating the 
Pell Grant tax tables - a law writ-

ten and passed by a Democratic 
Congress more than a decade ago 
in an effort to target Pell Grant 
aid to the poorest students in the 
country," Boehner stated in a press 
release earlier this year. "The use 
of the updated tables will make the 
Pell Grant program stronger, while 
protecting taxpayers and the poor-
est students in the country, who 
would otherwise have been dealt 
another blow in their hopes for 
an increase in the maximum Pell 
Grant award." 

Congressman George Miller 
(D-Calif.), senior Democrat on 
the House education committee, 
opposed the use of the new formu-
las and said that the reduction of 
Pell Grants represents a mistake. 

"Congress must do a better job 
of maintaining and improving its 
commitments to college students, 
and it should start by increasing 
the Pell Grant scholarship," Miller 
stated in a recent release. "Our 
nation's continued economic suc-
cess demands that we take the fed-
eral investment in higher education 
seriously." 

Congress has subsequently 

approved a $100 increase in the 
maximum Pell Grant award, 
although it is a smaller increase 
than Miller wanted. 

In its January report, GAO rec-
ommended that various measures 
be taken to ensure that student 
financial aid is determined by the 
most accurate method possible. In 
the short term, GAO recommends 
that the federal secretary of educa-
tion formalize procedures so that 
the department annually requests 
and obtains the most current tax 
data from the Internal Revenue 
Service. 

In addition, the Education 
Department should revise the 
methodology for calculating the 
tax allowance to better reflect the 
varying tax rates paid by students 
and families in different income 
groups, it recommended. 

For the long term, GAO recom-
mends that the department deter-
mine whether more effective data 
sources or methodologies exist for 
deriving the allowance.

Exception: Changes still not yet finalized 
continued from page 3 

by Exce ption in the past." 
The UC Office of the President 

establi shed the Admissions 
by Exception policy in 1996. 
According to UCOP spokeswoman 
Ravi Poorsina, the way the pro-
gram is implemented varies from 
campus to cam pus. 

Part of the policy allows for stu-
dents coming from disadvantaged 
backgrounds who do not meet 
the eligibility requirements to be 
admitted into a UC campus. The 
policy requires that no more than 

4 percent of a campus' applicants 
may be drawn from "disadvantaged 
students" and up to 2 percent from 
other students. 

"One way of using the poli -
cy is by admitti ng students who 
may be from a high school with -
out the resources, say a school 
that doesn't offer a foreign lan-
guage because it doesn't have the 
money," A.S . Vice President of 
Acad emic Affairs Harry Khanna 
said. "A student shouldn't be 
penalized fo r thi s." 

There is no formal mecha-

nism to track students admitted 
by exception because of the very 
small numbers. However, students 
accepted through the program are 
evaluated for their performance.

The UCSD Guardian is published twice a week at the University of California at San Diego. 
(ontenlS It> 2005. Views expressed herein represent the majority vote of the editorial board 

and are not necessarily those of the UC Board of RegenlS, the ASUCSD or the members 01 the 
Guardian staff. 

A.S. budget represents 
• • • competing vIsions 

I t's looking like this bud-get cycle will serve as the perfect opportu-
nity for our electea stu-
dent leaders to prove that 
they can put aside individ-
ual interests and create a 
plan that truly serves the 
entire UCSD community, 
And with tens of thousands 
of dollars in cuts to make, 
the fmal budget will make 
the priorities of the A.S. 
Council crystal clear. 

At this moment, sena-
tors have two philoso-
phies to choose from when 
aetermining what will go 
on the cutting block: They 
can act as direct represen-
tatives of the students or 
as their trustees, making 
potentially unpopular deci-
sions that truly serve the 
long-term interests of the 
student body. T his page, 
as in the past, endorses the 
latter vision. 

In the current budget 
debate, meager funds have 
pitted funding for student 
organizations against sup-
port for the U:S. Student 
Association and its UCcoun-
terpart. Though it's unfor-
tunate that court-mandated 
poligr changes have driven 
up US SA fees the same year 
that the council faces a defi-
cit, senators must approve 
the membershiy dues pro-
posed by A.S. President 
Christopher Sweeten. 

Witli the Higher 
Education Act reauthoriza-
tion on the congressional 
agenda this year, college stu-
dents can ill afford to weaken 
their lobby; trying to save a 
few dollars today may mean 
financial aid disaster for the 
students currently attending 
high school. 

To offset the dues, coun-
cilmembers must make the 
difficult choice and slightly 
pare support for student 
organizatIOns and college 
councils. For senators, that 
may mean acting against 
the immediate wishes of 

. their own constItuency, but 
ensuring a fiscally stable 

bu~g~t must be a b!gger 
prIOrIty than prov~dlOg 
local pork. 

WIth a' plethora of 
attempted and many suc-
cessful coll~ge-Ievel initia-
tives, the college councils 
have proven themselves 

resilient in adjusting to A.S, 
cuts in recent years. In the 
face of cuts, they can likely 
do it again, 

At the same time, the 
council must revisit the 
issue of funding for A,S, 
Safe Rides. It should be 
clear that the program has 
become far too expensive 
to afford under current 
activity fee levels, and it's 
unfortunate that last year's 
leaders lacked the politi-
cal will to find a perma-
nent solution for this fes-
tering problem. Like other 
areas, the Safe Rides budget 
must absorb its own share 
of reductions, which may 
mean longer wait times for 
students and a potential cap 
on the number of rides each 
student can receive. 

Once again, though 
politically di ffi cult , these 
choices will ensure that this 
program remains viable 
over the long term. 

Perhaps the only truly 
worrisome features of 
Sweeten's latest proposal 
are the cuts to the A.S. pro-
gramming office, Though 
based on sound logic, these 
cuts must be coupled with 
across-the-board stipend 
reductions, Otherwise, it 
would be disingenuous for 
the council to preserve its 
own pay while cutting the 
area that truly embodies 
everything most students 
know about the role of 
their elected leaders, r1ay-
ing into the hands 0 the 
Sun God Party and other 
populist groups who will 
likely exploit the program-
ming cuts in next year's 
elections. 

Overall, Sweete.n's bud-
get offers a moderate 
compromise that attempts 
to spread the pain fairly. 
Without shielding pet 
projects and programs, his 
spending J'roposal offers a 
stable an fiscally respon-
sible plan that should be 
adopted ' quickly, to avoid 
anomer 1 a.m. debacle like 
the one that occurred last 
year. . 
. How senators vote on 
the budget will truly reflect 
~hether they're committed 
to the interests of students 
or the special niche groups 
that helped get them elect-

You would think that the theo-
retical simplicity of the global 
capitalist system - where if you 
have something someone ,else 
wants, you sell it to them -
would make iminigration poIiqt 
.rel'tively clear. If multinational 
Corporations are free to move 
jobs wherever they can pay people 
the least, and can relocat~ their 
headquarters to o~scure .locales in 
order to avoid paying taXes, then 
the workers in that sysiem should 
also be expected to cross borders 
in order to get jobs, If we are 
going to allow large organizations 
(or even powerful individuals) to 
do virtually anything to maximize 

; their own benefit, -shouldn't we 
allow poorer workers t~ . do the

In America, the only thing that

" You would think that

or not you fulfill the current (arbi ~

deserves righ~ in the first place, 
During most of this country's ·his-
tory, if you were black, Chinese, 
japanese; Mexican or any of a host 
of other non-Caucasian nationali-
ties - whether or not you were a' 
citizen - even the most capitalist 
of ethics wouldn't earn you politi-
cal rights or ~ial membership: 

Today, instead of using race 
explicidy to exclude people from 
the opportunities an established 
white cititen takes for granted, 
we use political affiliation (class 
too, but that's a different part of 
the story). For Latinos looking 
to ditch their floundering home 
countries for comparatively plush 
jobs in the United States (most 
of which are unthinlcably menial 
by our bourgeois standards), the 
incredible sin of wanting a bet-
ter life for themselves and their 
family deserves a punishment 
illustrating the worst side of .the 
American character. Alexander de 
Tocqueville wrote in "Democracy 
in America" about the ridiculous 
tendency for Americans, no mat-
ter how undereducated or unin-
formect, to think that they auto-
mati~y know the best solution 
to everything.

Column: 
'Establishment 
afraid of rights 
for immigrants 

continued from page 4 
A: "Fllture gme771tiuns will illhtrir 

a tangle of ranrorrms, lInassimilaud, 
squ.abblillg cultllres with no common 
bond to hold them togtthfr. and a ctrUJin 
gtUlrantu of the deatb of this TIIltion as a 
hamwnious melting pot.» [sic} 

Having trouble missing the rac-
ism in that last statement? So am I. 
Also hard to overlook is the sa me 
argument used by critics of every 
wave of immigration, from Irish 
to Japanese, which says that the 
admission of any more members 
of a particular group (in this case, 
Latino workers) will lead to the 
end of the American way of life. 
(That should be all I need to prove 
these guys' use of brainpower is 
inversely related to the amount of 
fuel consumed by their four-wheel-
drive vehicles.) 

Whether or not Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger really meant it 
when he said the Minutemen were 
doing "a terrific job," the most 
interesting political reality of the 
debate over immigration policy 
is that the Bush administration 
ain't doing a thing about it, either 
way. Even though the Liberty and 
Law crowd are (shock!) some of 
his most ardent supporters, Bush's 
vital (read: ti nancial) support 
wmes from Big Business, and Big 
Business knows that illegal immi-
grants are a fantasti c source of 
cheap labor. 

Bush doesn 't want to offend 
supporters on either side of the 
issue; his solution, as it stands now, 
IS just to do nothing. Which means 
that those noble fools Out in the 
desert are going to get really sun-

" Bush doesn't want 
to offend supporters 
on either side of the 

, " lSSue ... 
burned this summer, and the poor 
dudes who just want a better job are 
going to get it even worse than they 
already have it. 

Critics ·of immigration are co r-
rect to demand documentati on 
and information about their fellow 
workers; they are wrong to want a 
different set of rights for them. 
Since the real problem with illegal 
immigration is not that people are 
coming - but that we don' t know 
who they are, where they work 
or whether they follow laws and 
pay taxes - isn't the solution to 
Ihm problems the obvious first 
step toward a realistic immigra-
tion policy? 

There's a crucial gap that has 
to be crossed before we get to 
that point, however. Creating a 
mechanism to legalize the millions 
of alien workers in this country 
would result in the sudden situ-
ation that many workers in this 
country who now have no rights 
and no political power would gain 
both. All the iIIegals working for 
less than minimum wage would get 
to complain as loudly as they want. 
All the mothers without health care 
for their chi ldren would get to 
complain, too. 

It's not hard to see why our 
immigration policies are a mess. A 
sudden spike in politically enfran-
chised, working brown people? 
Dedicated, vital workers or not, 
they're apparently sti ll toO scary 
for the white establishment to 
handle. 

You Imuw I'm too scary for the white 
mablishmmt to hrmdJe! Too scary.'

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Undergrads perform Peter Weiss' shocker at new Potiker Theatre 
By OAKLEY ANDERSON-

MOORE 
Staff Write r 

Emotionless cruelty. indulgent general copul3tion. imagery of limbs being hacked off . .. 
don't worry, you have not been 
conned into spendll1g 9 on "Sin 
City" again (its vacuous violence 
and celebration of the Abu Ghraib 
mentality is ample reason for less 
than one viewing). Rather, these 
extreme antics are from "The 
Persecution and Assassination of 
Jean Paul Marat As Performed 
by the Inmates of the Asylum of 
Charenton Under the Direction of 
the Marquis de Sade," or "Maratl 
Sade." a piece of entertainment 
also once chafged wi th existing 
for its shock value. "MaratlSade" 
is now playing through May 21 at 
UCSD's new Sheila and Hughes 
Potiker Theatre. 

But unlike the rather- dim strat-
egies eX hip Hollywood director 
Robert Rodriguez, the goyaning 
philosophy behind Peter Weiss' play 
is to use the shock value for a pur-
pose. "Marat/Sade" worb under the 
principles of the Theater- of Cruelty, 
which asserts that theater- should 
not c:oncem itself with imputing 
meaning through wonk. but rather 
chroush violent physicality and jolt-
ing sound. in order to bring the 
audience out of the desensitization 
of being spectatorS, showing ugli-
ness ·and pain in order to cajole the 
viewas into unleashing the sub-
romcious 10 ponder larger- realities. 
"MantlSIde," a tough show Jiven . 
surprising1y to the undergraduateS 
for • spring produaion, presents 
to us two hours of well-crafted the-
Iter- that continuously disturbs the 
mind and senses with impassioned 

inmate mobbing. intelligent politi-
cal speeches. jarring sound design 
and eerily demented. canoonish 
musical n~mbers . 

There arc a number of "cry 
mature performances that arise 
from this undergad show, no doubt 
so-ongly influenced by the visiting 
LA.-based director Stefan ovinski. 
who had the cast prepare for an 
entire quarter before rehearsal even 
started in the spring. It is no easy 
task to play realistic mental patients. 
let alone mental patients who are 
pretending to play characters in 
another play within this play. all the 
while acting in a style that does not 
emphasize the n:aditionai aspects 
of theater. As the inmates perfonn 
the Marquis de Sade's play about 
Jean-Paul Marat and his influence 
on France's Reign of Terror. the 
cast alternates between luring in 
the audience to their convincing 
pcrful1IWlce of irunates and bait-
ing us with their convincing per-
formance of chanctus from the 
French RCYOIution, purposely lav-
ing us feding ill-at-ease. 

Analeis Lorig. who plays 
Charlotte Corday. does a fine 
job of blurring the lines between 
Cordayand the narcoleptic patient; 
her singing voice. left tlIUefined, 
functions poignantly in contcn 
IS it Wlvers over the set. telling 
us to forget lbout the words and 
listen more to the raw human 
voice. A surprisinrly deliKhtful 
performance from Bryan Charles 
Swarberg IS the HCl"ald brinp a 
very robust dose of humor. as he 
effectively delivers his intennittent 
screwball metered rhymes. giv-
ing bits of droll pleasure. Steven 
Lone does a perceptively excel-
lent job of delivering Jean-Paul 
Mant's complex political speeches 

while mainraining a palpable suf-
fering from both the painful skin 
disease that keeps him in a bath-
tub and the nihili stic ideologi-
cal challenges of the Marquis de 

ade. Gregory Malcolm Moore 
tackles the Marquis de Sade. the 
historical figure from which the 
word "sadism" was coined, with 
confident authority - culminat-
ing in the vivid rendering of the 
scene where de Sade asks Corday 
to whip him as he delivers an 
immense soliloquy. 

Surrounding the cast is the 
exquisite lighting ofJeffFighonaster 
and inspired set of Melpomene 
Katakalos. both graduate design-
ers who no doubt must have been 
eager to work in the new Potiker 
space. The aesthetics of the ugliness 
of decay. insanity and poverty are 
reproduced so artfully that it almost 
becomes too beautiful. Perhaps 
Weiss' vision would have been truer 
in a more claustrophobic space like 
Galbraith Hall 157. when: the audi-
ence wouIdn't have the discmoe to 
admire the ~ like a painting. but 
nonecheless, one can hardly relin-
quish the striking dRct the designs 
have in the new space. 

There are many things at work 
in this prodlX:tion c1"MantlSade" 
and not lear is the very essence c1 
Weiss' play. which is the batding 
ideologies of pessimism, nihilism 
and finility of resisww:e offered. by 
the marquis apinst the impuioned 
demands £or IOCiaI reform, .pation 
and revolution from Mant. With 
the hish quality c1 this undergradu-
lte production, and the ever timely 
themes that are conjured in the 
play's historic style, "ManrlSade" 
is a necessary viewing £or everyone 
who can ~ up $10 for a

Snoop Dogg shows his padawan 
the Game just who is the mas r 

By ADAM STALEY 
Staff Writer 

APparently, the West Coast is back. and Snoop Dogg and the Game roll into RIMAe Arena 
May 20 to show "How the West 
Was One." At first glance. this pair-
ing seems to make sense, but upon 
further review, one has to question 
Snoop's motives. Snoop has been 
a rrue legend in the rap industry 
since his debut on "Deep Cover" 
and appearances on The Chrollic. but 
now, ironically. it seems that the 
West Coast's P-I-M-P has been rel-
egated to pimping himself off for the 
advancement of Game's career. 

The concept of being "put on" 
is nothing new in hip-hop. and, in 
fact, some of the brightest stars in 
hip-hop may have never achieved 
stardom without the help of their 
mends. EPMD brought us Redman, 
Ice Cube brought us Mack 10, and 
Dr. Ore has introduced us to Snoop. 
Eminem IOd now Game. However. 
what!el*"ltes Game &om the rest is 
his lack of history or any intenction 
whatsoever with the industry until 
quite recently. Credibility is crucial 
in the rap game. and artists usually 
must pay their dues or cam their 
stripes in order to qualify themselves 
as viable bip-hop utisu. Game was 
IOIIlChow able to cin:wnYCnt this 
whole process and slap directly to 
!he nujor-label record deal without 
more than a bwnp in the road. 

nus is not meant 10 be an indict-
ment eX Game. because the man 
has truly been through many hard 
times in his life. but he has also been 
searching in vain for his meal ticket 
for years now. and rapping wasn't at 

the top of his ongll1ul list. ,\ !any Yl.lrs 
ago, Gamc met! to be a modd t()r 
GQ, a little known bct that bC{'Jmc 
publicized thanks to hi, feud \\ ilh 
Yukmouth (one has to wonder \\hy 
there wasn't a mirror handy at the 
time to convince him otherwi~c), Jnd 
also appeared on the dating show. 
"Change of Ileart," where Game 
wanted to stay together only to 11U\'e 
his girlfriend go for the other gur. It 
was only after Game awoke from Ius 
coma after being shot in a botched 
robbery that he had his brother go 
out and buy Doggyrtylt, Reasulloblr 
Doubt and Ready to Die, among other 
hip-hop classics. to guide his way 
toward becoming a rap superstar. 

Boasting a violent past proved to 
be not quite enough for much of hip-
hop. so Game proceeded to insti-
gate beefs with a variety of linder-
whelming opponents. such as Joe 
Buddens and Yukmoum, in order 
to further his credibility. Whether 
Game even came out on the top 
of these beefs is highly debal2ble. 
but mainstreamecs wanted to accept 
up-and<Olller Game oyer a disap-
pointing. wdwismatic New Yorker 
and a little-known Bay Area rapper, 
respectivdy. Riding this supposed 
momentum as well as 1211 rales of 
gang lore, Game released his debut 
album, Tbt Doamrnrury, wtUch has 
KOOC four times platinum world-
wide. It would seem that Game has 
6naIly made it. that his success can't 
be denied, but many in hip-hop are 
havin« trouble stomaching what has 
been unforgivably force·fed. 

And that is exactly where Snoop 
comes in. The presence of Snoop

Prefuse 73 
Surrounded by Silence 

Sub Pop 

*** 

As hip-hop migrates from the rurntable to the laptop, what was once 
experimental now seems 
inevit'2ble. Scott Herren's 
work as Prefuse 73 shows 
that this situation may not 
be as dire as many hip-hop 
purists once thought. 

Herren isn't a hip-hop 
producer by trade, and the 
bulk of thi album is made 
up of bizarre insrrwnentals, 
chopped-up vocals and other 
obscure samples that create 
a unique SOrt of musical col-
lage. These "glitch-hop" 
tracks deserve recognition 

for their musical CreatlVlty 
and require a good set of 
headphones to appreciate 
fully. 

A \vide variery of hip-
hop artists are employed by 
I Ierren, including virrual 
unknowns Beans and Camu, 
more underground artists 
EI-P and Aesop Rock, and 
W u-Tang reps Ghostface, 
GZA and Masta Killa . Ghost 
and EI-P make an interesting 
duet on the opening track 
"Hideyaface," both deliver-
ing sharp verses, and GZA 
doesn 't disappoint on 'Just 
the Thought," a fast-paced 
beat upon which Masta Killa 
suun bl es. 

This album's all -over-
the-place nature, from indie 
to hip-hop to techno, can 
be slightly overstimulating, 
yet it maintains cohesion all 
along, never leaving the lis-
tener behind. Herren, who 
defies genre, seems to make 
music for Matrix fans who 
smoke weed; whether or not 
you fall into that honorable 
category, this album is still 
an interesting journey. 

Pre fuse 73 will perform 
at the Casbah May 23.

The Milk of Human 

Kindness 
Sire 

**** 

Caribou was formerly known as Manitoba. His name had to be changed 
when an old punker threat-
ened a trademark infringe-
ment suit (a pretty unpunk 
move). Manitoba was known 
for putting out visionary lap-
top landscapes, and with The 
Milk Of Human Kindness, 
so now will be Caribou. 
Will the name change hurr 
him? No; Milk is the kind of 
record that transcends any 
music industry bullshi t; as 
long as people hear it, he 
should be fine. 

Caribou (aka Dan 
Snaith) just got his doctor-
ate in mathematics, having 
toured for his last releases 
over summer breaks. Good 
that he's done, because after 
this record, he ought to ded-
icate all of his time to music. 
He does ticka-ticka-ticka-
ticka-ticka (real faSt) badass 
hip-hop beats and sunglass 
heroin-blues grooves with 
authentic grain. He annihi-
lates speaker cones and ear-
drums with impossibly loud 
drum samples. He tiptoes on 
gut strings across lamentable 
afternoons. He kraut-rocles 
stiffly and singer-songwrit-
ers profound, simple, con-
fusing sadness. He does 
Aphex Twin with less geeky 
obsessiveness and RJD2 with 
far more imagination. He 
knows how to anchor him-
self inside a beat (and how 
to free himself from it); how 
to set a vintage tube amp (or 
at least make the computer 
sound like one); overall, how 
to squeeze transcendence 
out of the conven tional tools 
of lesser men. 

Caribou will perfonn at 
the Casbah May 22.

***** 

Gang of Four appear in record reviews all over the goddamn place, 
but no one who ever reads 
about them seems to listen. 
Whenever anyone compares 
a band to Gang of Four, they 
are referring to the band 's 
1979 debut Enrtrlainmmt!, 
which is more intelligent, 
furious and captiva ting than 
anything compared to it. 
Previously available as a UK 
impon, this reissue adds the 
Yellow EP and five more 
tracles. 

The band dealt in nervy 
and jagged punk, combining 

crank-fueled P-funk (P for 
pWlk, not Parliament) bass 
with the kind of chopped-
up, toothy guitar equiva-
lent to crackling e1ectriciry. 
Below is the well -tempered 
frenzy of syncopated disco-
punk beats to which people 
once used to dance. The 
vocals are feral and nihilis-
tic, like Eugene Debs faced 
with the crushing despair 
of the modern world, sput-
tering lyrics commenting 
on politics and society with 
black venom. Each song is 
memorable in its own right, 
but a few tracks are classic: 
The greasily sexy "Damaged 
Goods" is among the top 
five punk songs ever, "At 
Home He's a Tourist" is 
the kind of pop-culrure rant 
that incites self-evaluation 
along with the urge to rock, 
and "5.45" disdains sanitized 
news in the face of impe-
rialist butchery, a situation 
unchanged 26 years later. 

Back when U2 was good, 
they imitated this. So did 
Fugaz.i and the Mi nuremen, 
and so too do Franz 
Ferdinand and the Rapntre. 
Accept no imitations.

Star Wars: 
. The most 

vital moments 
seem rushed 

continued from page 7 
of the story with the necessary 
candor. The weight of having so 
much story to tell seems to push 
both Lucas and his cast to run 
through the motions of important 
events - which is terrible, consid-
ering that this is supposed ~o be the 
movie that shows the crucial devel-
opments of which we've dreamed 
since the beginning. 

But viewers who wanted less cud-
dly talk and more badassness have 
the film they've been wai ting for. 
The opening space battle is, for once, 
as good as-any in the originals (aided 
gready by the aforementioned chem-
istry between Kenobi and Skywalker), 
and gets right to the film's best 
pan: its seemingly endless stream 
of jaw-dropping effects scenes. If • 
this film shows Lucas' ambivalence 
toward realistic acting and character 
development, it also shows that his 
imagination is still what it once was, 
brought more fantastically to the 
screen than ever before. With more 
cool planet environments than pos-
sibly any other "Star Wars" movie 
- including lush, verdant jungles 
(filmed in the jungles of Thailand 
and China) and an incredible volcano 
scene (filmed at the actual eruption 
of Mt. Etna in Italy), "Revenge" sets 
a new visual standard for all sci-fi 
movies. (Which it damn well bet-
ter, considering this is the last "Star 
Wars" movie ever to be made.) 

The action scenes - which 
thank.fully tak.e up most of the 
film - impress on a similar level. 
ChristenSen, McGregor and oth-
ers practiced for hours every day 
in order to develop the incredible 
lightsaber skills used almost con-
stantly throughout "Revenge"; 
their battles, accordingl y, often 
reach superhuman levels of 
speed and precision. A panel of 
incredible villains - a skilled 
Count Dooku .(C hristopher Lee), 
th e frighteningly real cyborg 
General Grievous and, 'Of co urse, 
the Emperor himself - pushes 
"Revenge" up to the originals in 
the Evil department. 

Still, the lengthy devolution 
of Anakin into Darth Vader is in 
many ways disappointing, due in no 
small pan to the fact that Hayden 
Christensen can make exactly one 
facial expression (temper tantrum). 
Seeing as this was probably the 
most important (and anticipated) 
aspect of not only this episode 
but the entire new trilogy, Lucas 
deserves to have some major points 
docked . Whether or not it was 

. even possible, in the minds of "Star 
Wars" fans, to m atch the success 
of the earlier films is impossible to 
know. But as for proving that mak-
ing the new trilogy wasn't a mistake, 
"Revenge" succeeds - barely. 

Game: He's 
not a master 

continued {rom /XJ«e .7 
and Tha Dogg Pound add the· 
credibility, longevity and sense of 
accomplishment that Game lacks. 
Unfortunately for concert organiz-
ers, the only people that they are· 
going to fool with this trick are the 
people who have already been fooled 
into thinking that Game is one of. 
the best in the business. Continue to . 
thump your copy of Tht DommmtlZry 
as a classic, ·shell out your S40 and 
claim that Game put the West bad< 
on the map; the rest of us will be lis-
tening to E-40, Ras Kass, Too Shon:, 

. Ice Cube, Andre Nickatina, Living 
Legends, Kurupt, Hiero, Mac Dre 
and Cali Agents, confident that the 
West Coast~ never gone.

continued from page l:l 
9:24.2. While the time was 15 sec-
onds off his personal best, Lostrom 
was not worried. 

"This race was a lot more like 
a workout than a race," he said. 
"I'm getting ready for Nationals, 
and I'm working on different tech-
niques." 

Lostrom focused on the hurdles 
and the lap spli ts during this week-
end's event, and was happy with the 
way he raced. 

"The things I was working on 
came out well. I found out this 
works, this doesn't work," he said. 
"And in terms of looking toward-
nationals, I'm happy with how it 
came out." 

When asked about Nationals, 
Lostrom said his goal was to race 

throughout the entire event. 
"I want to be in the thick of 

it, and duke it out with the other 
guys," he said. "I'm not wholly 
concerned with a certain time or 
finish . I wanr those guys to say, 
'Hey, that San Diego guy put on a 
good fighr.'~ 

Cunningham finished in fourth 
place in the 11 0 hurdles, fin-
ishing the race in which he has 
already qualified for Nationals in 
14.48 seconds. Cunningham also 
qualified in the 400 hurdles for 
Nationals. His goal for Nationals 
is to race a low 51-second 400 
hurdles and make All-American, 
which means he will have to finish 
among the top eight. 

"I hate the 4OO-meter hurdles 
with a passion," he said. "But it's 

my.focus because I'm better at it. 
The good thing this year is that 
there 's one guy who's way ahead 
of everybody, bur everyone else 
is really close, like within half a 
second or so. My main goal is to 
get second, since tl:te race is wide 
open." 

Junior teammate Jon Patton, a 
junior, took fourth in the 400 hur-
dles with a time of 53.3 3 seconds. 

In the jumping events, senior 
Kevin Beeman took second place in 
the men's high jump with his mark 
of 2. 10 meters. For Nationals, 
Beeman is seeded 10th in the high-
jump event.

Track and field sends nine to NCAA· Nationals 
Regular season ends with promise as Hodgins, Blue break records 

By JESSICA NAGER 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's and wom-
en 's track and field teams finished 
thei r regular season on May 14 
at the Claremont C lassic, held at 
Burns Track and Field complex 
in Claremont, Calif. Junior Mimi 
Hodgins and freshman Laiah Blue 
posted school records in the 800-
meter race and 100-meter hurdles, 
respectively, while senior Kendra 
Canape 'finished first in the wom-
en's high jump and junior Carl 
Lostrom topped his competition to 
win the men's steeplechase. 

During the Claremont Classic, 
Hodgins set a new school record 
in the 800 race. Despite finishing 
third overall , Hodgins was able 
to break her own school record, 
which she had set· earlier in the 
year, and posted a time of 2 lnin-
ute , 10.9 1 seconds. 

"Jt's nice to know I'm still PR-
mg," Ilodgins said. " I think I have 
J lOt more left in me, and my coach 
agrees, so it's a good feeling to have 
going mto Nationals." 

On May 16, nine UCSD track 
and tield athlete found out that 
d1clr ,cason was not over. For the 
WOlllell, Ilodgin'>, Hlue, Canape, 
selllor Lmdsav Stalker, and fresh-
men Emily I~Greg-()r and Whitney 
J ohn~on will be representing the 
Tmons at the 0iCAA Track and 
Field hampionshlps. Lo trom, 
junior ,\lIke unningham and 
sel1lor Kevin Beeman made the cur 
from the men's quad. 

De pite quali~~ng in the 00, 
the 1500 and the 5000 events, 
Hodgins will only compete in the 
800 at Nationals.

performances throughout the 
2005 campaign, including a .48 1 
slugging percentage, a .358 bat-
ting average and 78 total bues 
- including 12 doubles - in '8 
hits. This is Spencen first time 
being selected to an all-confer-
ence team.

she said. "I feel that in order to 
achieve that goal, I need to focus 
on one event. " 

Stalker took fourth place in the 
800 run at Claremont, finishing at 
2: 11.20. Stalker will compete in 
the 800 run and the 1500 run at 
Nationals. She is ranked fourth in 
the 800, just behind Hodgins, and 
eighth in the 1500. 

Blue finished the 100 hurdles 
in 14.11 seconds, tying the school 
record set during the 2004 season 
by Meredith Perry. The time is 
an automatic qualification for the 
NCAA Championships; she will be 
one of two freshmen in the nation 
to compete in the 100 hurdles. 

Sophomore Elisa Holiday took 
second in the long jump with a 
mark of 5.72 meters, then secured 
a third-place finish in the 200 dash 
with a time of 24.62. In the 1500 
run, Hodgins and freshman Dianne 
Dunn finished fifth and seventh, 
respective ly. 

Canape rook first in the high 
jump competition with her mark 
of 1.63 meter. Canape used the 
weekend's competition as a warmup 
for , ationals. For the high-jump 
event, each meet has its own mini-
mum starti ng height. ormally, the 
minimum starting height is -+ feet 8 
inches, but anape u ually starts 
around 5-2. At ational, the start-
mg height is --4, meaning there is 
no warm-up jump. 

"You have ro be on it right 
away," Canape said. 

The competition for the wom-
en's high jump will be tight at 
Nationals. Ca nape is eeded 12th 
with her best mark of 5 feet 7.75 
inches, but points out that the 
majority of the other competitors 
are within an inch and a half of 
that mark.

Another hurdle: Junior Jon Patton and the Tritons ended the 2005 season w~h a number of triumphs at the daremont Classic. 

"Considering that the bar goes 
up two inches after every jump, I'm 
right in the thick of it," she said. 
"What I'm really excited about is 

that I've been jumping consistent-
ly close to that height all season, 
while a lot of the other girls have 
only jumped it once." 

For the men, Lostrom won the

Women's crew earns NCAA berth 
Varsity-eight boat qualifies with at-large selection 

By MATTHEW GRANT 
Sports Ed itor 

Within a week of setting its 
fastest time of the 2005 season, 
the UCSD women's crew var-
sity-eight boat has been chosen 
as one of two at-large teams 
to be represented at the NCAA 
Division II Women's Rowing 
Championships in Sacramento, 
Calif., from May 27 through May 
29. 

Head coach P attie Pinkerton 
emphasized the significance of 
the achievement for the entire 
team, not just those individuals 
on the qualifying boat. 

"While only nine women 
will be sitting in the boat on 
the starting line, this has come 
about through the hard work of 
the team," Pinkerton stated in 
a press release. "This is a trans-
formational moment for UCSD 
women's crew, and one we have 
been working toward for some 
time." 

The selection comes follow-
ing a season of several significant 
accomplishments, most recently a 
second -place finish at the Pacific 
Coast Rowing Championships 
on May 14 at Lake Natoma, 
Ca lif. The varsity-eight boat 
conquered the seemingly insur-
mountable even-minute barrier 
for the two-kilometer course, 
which put the quad in a posi-
tion to be selected as an at-large 
team in the upcoming NCAA 

Championships. 
The nine Tritons who will 

compete in Sacramento are junior 
coxswain Arianna Pilram, senior 
Anne Roddy, junior Meghan 
Kelly, senior Sarah Smolley, 
junior Cara Kuebert, sophomore 
Leah Llach, freshman Vanessa 
Jansen, junior Christine King 
and junior Dannon Hodge, with 
junior Melanie Kaelberer and 
senior Liz Record as alternates. 

This is the first time the 
Tritons have been invited to the 
event since its establishment 
in 2002. Since that time, UC 
Davis was crowned with the title 
twice before being dethroned 
by Mercyhurst College of Erie, 
Penn., in 2004. 

Mercyhurst will return to the 
annua l regatta hosted by Cal 
State Sacramento at the Cal State 
Sacramento Aquatic Center to 
represent the East region and to 
defend its team title against the 
three other qualifying teams. 

The other represented pro-
grams in the team competi-
tion are Western Washington 
University from the West region, 
Nova Southeastern University of 
Fort Lauderdale, Fla ., racing on 
behalf of the South region and the 
Florida Institute of Technology 
from Melbourne, Fla ., which will 
compete as an at- large team. 

The remaining boats, UCSD 
and Barry University of Miami 
Shore, Fla., are designated as 
at-large programs that will not 

be represented in the team com-
petition. T hese slots are saved 
for two of the most qualified 
programs in the country that do 
not automatically qualify region-
ally. 

Team and individual boat 
selections were based on several 
criteria , including student-a th-
lete availability, head-to-head 
competi tion, late-season per-
formance, regional rankings, 
regional championship results, 
results against teams al ready 
selected, results against region-
ally ranked teams and results 
against common opponents. The 
formula is essentially designed 
to guarantee an all-around com-
peti tive race from each of the six 
boats entered. 

In addition to Mercyhurst's 
advantage of experience at the 
race, Western Washington, 
Barry and Florida Tech will all 
be sending veteran programs to 
the NCAA Division II Women's 
Rowing Championships. 

In 2004, Western Washington 
finished fourth behind third -
place Florida Tech, second-place 
Humboldt State and champion 
Mercyhurst. 

In the two previous years since 
the event's inception, the Vikings 
found themselves stuck as run-
ner-up behind UC Davis. 

Barry has twice been kept out 
of medal contention , with back-
to-back fourth-place finishes in 
2002 and 2003 .
