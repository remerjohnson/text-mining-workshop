BECAUSE OF a current boom in economic and cultural exchange between the 
United States, Latin America and 
Asia, there is a great demand for 
professionals with skills in 
management and reseach who are 
familiar with the cultures of the 
Pacific Basin. 

At a pon destined to become 
one of the world's foremost trade 
centers, UCSD, eager to build a 
professional graduate school, has 
an e cellent chance of becoming 
home to the Graduate School of 
International Relations and Pacific 
Studies, the first kind in the 
country. Please tum to page 7

Blood drive. 
Students, faculry and staff will 

halle a chance to donate blood 
to help replenish the UCSD 
Blood Reserve Fund during the 
week of October 14 at twO 
locations. 

All UCSD students, faculty and 
staff, plus immediate families , are 
covered by the fund which 
makes blood available to anyone 
within the UCSD community 
who may need it. 

The Blood Reserve Fund is 
similar to a savings account. 
When a 'member uses blood for 
any reason, it is supplied by the 
San Diego Blood Bank In order 
to replace the blood used , the 
member can conLlct the Blood

A new study conducted in the 
San Diego communiry of Rancho 
Bernardo links increased 
cholesterol levels in women with 
coffee consumption , but finds no 
similar effect in men. 

Acknowledging the 
unexplained difference in results 
between men and women , and 
the varying results of a number 
of similar studies conducted 
around the world. the study's 
authors urge further experimental 
research to clarify the 
relationship between coffee and 
cholesterol. 

Dr. Cedric Garland , assistant 
professor of communiry and 
family medicine at the UCSD 
School of Medicine and co-
author of the study. speculated 
that since the Rancho Bernardo 
population has a dietary fat 
intake and blood cholesterol level 
lower than the national average, 
the effect of coffee may be more 
noticeable. 

"This study appears to 
indicate that for active women 
who consume moderate amounts 
of saturated falS. drinking four or 
more cups of coffee may 
significantly elevate blood 
cholesterol: said Gfarland. 
"Hean disease, America's number 
one health problem. is directly 
associated with cholesterol levels. 
so the increased risk could be 
significant."

Students arrested for 
police interference 
By JOHN SCHACHT 

Early Friday morning twO 
UCSD srudents - members of 
the Free South Africa Coalition 
- were handcuffed and taken to 
the UCSD police station where 
they were detained for 
approximately one hour. 

Students Sadhana Bery and 
RusseU Andaleio were posting 
leaflets on the ground on the 
walkway between Revelle plaza 
and the gym on Thursday night 
when they were stopped by a 
campus police officer at 
approximately II pm. "Two 
officers came up to us while we 
were posting the strike 
announcements for next friday." 
they said . "They claimed that 
what we were doing was illegal 
because the coalition was a non-
registered student organization 
and could therefore not caU for a 
strike. After we talked to the 
officers and told them that we 
were sponsored by the new 
indicator, they agreed that if we 
would mark that on the lea8ets 
we could continue to post them." 

Allegedly the officers then 
demanded a copy from the 
students and were den'ied, 
whereupon the officers 
demanded to see the 10 of each 
student because they were on 
private property. Andaleio and 
Bery said. 

"We did not want to give 
them our IDs because they did 
not tell us that we were 
committing any crime," Andaleio 
said . -There were members of 
the scuba club there preparing 
for the FFOG festival, and they 
didn't ask them for any ID." 

The officers then left. and the 
two students decided to spend 
the night in order to protect the 
flyers. they said. During the night 
the twO students saw several 
communiry service officers pass 
by on their rounds. According to 
Andaleio. one of the CSOs told 
him that it was the content of 
the flyer that was bothering the 
police, and that "they (the 
police) would try to prevent it 
(the strike)." 

The two students claim that 
the San Diego police drove by at 
least three times between 2 and 
6 am. A San Diego police 
depanmem dispatcher (# 107) 
confirmed that the UCSD 
campus is not a pan of the 
SDPD's normal beat, but that they 
will appear on campus when 
asked to by the campus 
authorities. 

At approximately 8:45 in the 
morning, two UCSD police 
officers. Captain John Anderson 
and LI. Jay Dwyer, appeared on 
the walkway where the flyers 
were posted . At this poim, 
according to the twO students, 
Anderson began tearing the flyers 
orr the ground . Dwyer confirmed 
this Sunday. explaining that the 
flyers were illegally posted and 
unSightly. 

Andaldo and Bery said that 
they approached the officers and 
asked them why they were 
ripping the flyers off the ground , 
and claimed tha" if posting the 
flyers was a crime, they were 
responsible for it and would 
accei't the consequences. The 
two students also said the police 
were only removing the flyers 
caUing for a student strike . 

Lt. Dwyer said aU of the flyers 
on the sidewalk were being 
removed . When asked whether 
the police objected to rhe 

content of the Dyers. which 
denounce South African 
apanheid and call for a general-
campus strike on Friday, ~ctober 
11 . Dwyer said. "that defInitely IS 
not the case." But. he added, 
"Our problem was we weren't 
sure they were on-campus 
folks .... If it's going to impact 
the entire campus as (this) 
might, of course the police are 
going to take an interest in il" 

Two other officers then 
handcuffed both students for 
-interfering with an officer," 
Dwyer said. "They just would not 
get ~~t of John's (Anderson's) 
face . 

"If we had been told of the 
crime. we would have identified 
ourselves," Bery said . "bur since 
we weren't accused of anything. 
we felt that it was not fair -
there were plenty of other 
students around there. and they 
never asked them for their ID." 

The students claim that they 
never had their rights read to 
them, which Dwyer said was 
because the law only requires it 
if questioning penains to the 
offense. Sery also said that she 
was searched by a male officer. 

Once at the police station, the 
students claim they remained 
handcuffed for approximately 20 
minutes. until they divulged their 
names. 

"TechniCally. they were un-
arrested," Dwyer said. fi:I

Earthquake data rocks Seismic science 
By SEAN WAGSTAFF 

Thirty-fi ve kilometers below 
the earth 's surface. two 
continental plates gave way to 
years of stored strain . surging 
and buckling as they slipped 
pasr each orher. 

Above the origin of the 
powerful eanhquake . small 
Mexican towns literaUy rode on 
waves of eanh. Every two 
seconds the ripples slipped by 

- for a total of about 40 
seconds . When the waves 
reached Mexico City some 250 
miles away, much of the 
eanhquake's energy had 
dissipated ; but the City was built 
on a gigantiC bowl of soft 
sediment. Instead of merely 
shaking like the towns before it, 
Mexico began rocking on its 
foundations , gaining momentum. 

Dr. James Brune: "The resonantJrequency of this layer of sediment. . . means ... 
the valley of Mexico will osci/late like a bowl of Jen-D." 

and many cheaply constructed 
concrete buildings swayed 10 the 
rhythm of the ground like 
gigantic tuning forks. 

The deSCription of the 
earthquake was among the 
fi ndings of a team of scientists 
from Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography's Institute of 
Geophysics and Planetary 
Physics (IGPP) and the 
Universidad Nacional Autonoma 
de Mexico (UNAM). Princi pal 
investigators are Drs. James 
Brune and John Anderson. of 
SIO. and Jorge Prince and Dr. 
Krishna Singh of UNAM. 
Graduate students frank Vernon 
and Paul Bodin are also working 
on the project. 

Anticipating a major 
earthquake in the area. the team 
had planted a number of 
accelerographs - strong 
eanhquake sensing devices - in 
the ground in the area of the big 
quake which was measured ar 
8.1 on the Richter Scale by the 
National Eanhquake Information 
Service (NElS) in Boulder. 
Colorado. The data they 
collected from those devices. 
only a small fraction of wh ich 
has so far been analyzed . is 
believed to be the best-ever 
recording of a major earthquake . 
and has already gone far towards 
explaining the disaster that 
struck the city of 18 million. 

Dr. James Brune. head of the 
research project at IGPP. said the 
sites of the sensing devices were 
chosen on the basis of research 
into the history of the area. Two

large seismic f~ults known as the 
Guerrero and Michoacan gaps 
were ident ified as the source of 
numerous powerful quakes which 
have hit Mexico in this century. 
Records show that both a reas 
were due for earthquakes, but the 
75-year absence of major quakes, 
except for one In 1979 in (he 
Michoacan gap. suggested that 
the faults might be "aseis mic" 
(permanently filled). 

"We were ... not completely 
convinced that the (Michoacan) 
gap (was) permanently ase ismic 
so ... when we were instaUing 
our array of strong motion 
instruments, we put instruments 

into both of the gaps," Anderson 
said . 

Last year the team had planted 
21 of the 30 detectors originaUy 
plan ned in the coastal area west 
of Mexico City. All but twO 
recorded good data . according to 
Anderson. 

Eanhquake faults store the 
energy of large pieces of the 
earth's cruSt as they push against 
one another. The longer it takes 
fo r two to give way and slip past 
each other, the more energy they 
store.

Selective Censorship is back 
Tiley can only set Jree men 

free .. . and there is no need of that 
Free men set themselves Jree. 

-James Oppenheim 
You would think that with the 

overabundance of people 
auempting to enter into the 
profession of law these years, 
that basic codes of freedom such 
as the Bill of Rights would go 
undisputed. at the very least on 
public propenty. Not so at UCSD. 
Last Friday morning, at the 
behest of some very debatable 
university regulations, a few 
policemen detained rwo students 
for taping leaflets on the Revelle 
walkway. Those regulations, 
which forbid the pasting of 
literature on the ground 
anywhere on university propeny, 
were enforced rather selectively 
last Friday, and [he fonhcoming 
reaction to that type of 
censorship should prove to all 
the outrageousness and 
unconstitutionality of the 
regulation in the first place. 

Apparently, the regulation was 
originally set in place for 
ecological reasons. namely to 
prevent the walkways from 
becoming endless billboards. The 
universIty deCided over the past 
few years that instead of paying 
sanitation crews a few extra 
thousand dollars for cleaning the 
walkways each week, it would 
designate only a few areas where 
one could POSt his or her 
functions , revelations, requests, 
etc .... . They thought, of course, 
that this action would save tIme, 
money, aesthetics and heartache 
for aD concerned. The underlying 
reason for this rule, though, is a 
bit more devious. 

If you happen to be a member 
of any student organization , you 
know what a hassle it is to go 

through the pro ess of posting 
your literarure . Any person or 
organization that wishes to 
announce something must go to 
each college provost's office and 
obtain a signarure or stamp to 
legitimize their statement in the 
eyes of the university. What you 
have to say to the community, 
then is puc under review for 
approval. Imagine that. How silly 
of us to believe that the First 
Amendment ensured freedom of 
speech and of the press and the 
right to oetition! Could it 

possibly·be that the unive rsi ty 
administration , in all their great 
wisdom, forgot these words, this 
law, 'Congress shall make no law 
respecting an establishment of 
religion , or prohibiting the free 
exercise thereof; or abridging the 
Jrwlbm of speech, or of the press; 
or the right of people peaceably 
to assemble and to petition the 

Government for a redress of 
grievances." It son of gives one a 
chill to think that Congress , a 
freely elected group of citizens 
accountable to the public, connot 
make a law endangering our 
libeny, but that the UCSD 
administration has done so, 
overstepping the Bill of Righls in 
the process. 

Well now, we are sure that in 
addressing this analysis, the 
administration will claim on 
Friday that the police were not 
censorin£ for content, but merely 

for location. They will claim that 
the policemen who detained the 
rwo students, and the 
Community Service Officers who 
were running around "trying to 
tear the literature off the ground 
like a bunch of kids robbing a 
candy store," as one witness 
aptly said, were in fact nO( 
censoring anyone at all. Strange, 

though, how during the ensuing 
argument berween the students 
and the policemen, that one 
policeman, after being asked why 
they were tearing up this as 
opposed to any other literature 
stuck in "the wrong place," was 
heard to say that it was because 
of the message, which the police 
did not like. Whew! 

So what was the message that 
bothered these protectors of the 
law? Strike, it said . Strike on 
Friday, October 11, in solidarity 

with the South African prisoners. 
Don't go to your classes; tell your 
friends nOt to go to classes; do 
not participate in the nonnal 
university activities on that day. 
Why? Oh, please, you know why, 
deep down in your hean of 
heans - because people are 
being murdered, detained, for no 
other reason than for speakin~ 

Ignoring the Third World 
By JOE WAINIO 
There is insanity all around us, 

we have only to recognize it. 
Does not the following scenario 
seem to you insane? And yet it is 
real. 

Here is the scenario: the vaSt 
majority of the world's 
population lives in 
underdeveloped countries or 
what we call the Third World . 
The people of these regions must 
struggle daily to meet their basic 
human needs. Some complete 
the task unsuccessfully and 
subsist. Many others do not, and 
die. Meanwhile , in the United 
States, the issue for at least 90 
percent of the population is not 
survival but rather wh ich luxuries 
must be foregone . People 
commonly have such 
conveniences as washing 
machines, dryers, automatic 
dishwashers, microwave ovens, 
refrigerators, telephones, 
television sets, stereos, 
automobiles, electric hair dryers, 
shavers, can openers, elC . Some 
luxuries free us from arduous, 
time-consuming chores, aDowing 
us free time to be spent learning 
or playing. Other luxuries serve 
as entenalnment. High 
technology is, in a vety real 
sense an everyday pan of our 
lives, in stark contrast with that 
of the peoples of the Third 
World. And the gap m living 
conditions between the nch and 

poor countries, instead of 
closing, is growing wider and 
wider. 

It is in this context that 
focusing our auention primarily 
on [he funher pursuit of even 
higher technology becomes 
mindless and , in my view, 
immoral. 

Is it nO( more logical, more 
humane - beller - to instead 
urgently direct our creative 
energies toward a more equitable 
global distribution of available 
technology? One can reasonably 
reach such a conclusion upon 
considering the nature of most 
new technological research , 
funded and directed as it is by 
the Defense Depanment or its 
agents (e .g. NASA). Anyone who 
believes that our government has 
sponsored the space shuttle 
chiefly out of intellectual 
c'llriosiry is radically misguided. 
The shuttle crews have already 
conducted classified DOD 
experiments while in space. 
Some of the most extensive 
technological research and 
develo'pment done today is in 
the area of ami-sateDite and 
other weaponry. Now President 
Reagan touts the vinues of the 
Strategic Defense Initiative, or 
"Star Wars," and justifies the 
massive expenditures necessary 
to research this proposed new 
weapons system by claiming thaI 
Star Wars is a new concept - a 

defensive weapons system -
qualitatively different from 
previous escalations of the anns 
race. Mr. Reagan seems oblivious 
to the fact that for the past 40 
years we have been using our 
nuclear arsenal as a defensive 
system. We have called this 
deterrence. 

It is wonh noting that the Star 
Wars concept is still very little 
more than a figment of Mr. 
Reagan's imagination. It is 
estimated that development of 
this new weapon would take at 
least a decade more of multi -
billion dollar budgets, and some 
scientists doubt that Star Wars 
would ever approach Mr. 
Reagan's leak-proof umbrella 
goal. The Soviets are no fun her 
along in their research of this 
type than we are; indeed. they're 
probably trailing by a significant 
margin. We now have an historic 
opportunity to prevent a 
quantum leap in the anns race. 
to denf the militarization of 
space. A comprehensive test ban 
treaty must be reached. Why nOt 
devote more energy and 
resources to developing bener 
verification procedures (to 
monitor compliance of arms 
control treaties) rather than to 
yet another round of weaponry? 

As the US continues to allocate 
such obscenely huge budgets for 
development of higher 

technology to be used for 
mllitary purposes, millions of 
people in the Third World live 
- and die - in primitive 
conditions. Some would resist 
thinking about the problem and 
what we should do about it. 
using expressions such as: "we 
ha ve to take care of our own 
first ," or 'what goes on in these 
other countries is not our 
respohsibility," or "we can't take 
our concentration for one minute 
from the Soviet menace," etc. But 
the truth is, the United States -
has by far the largest economy in 
the world and our domestic 
economic policlcs reverberate 
throughout the globe in ways 
most US citizens simply do not 
understand. The huge federal 
deficit brought to us counesy of 
Ron "Fiscal Conservative" Reagan 
keep interest rates high nO( only 
here but abroad. That makes it 
much more difficult for Third 
World countries to pay their 
foreign debts. Often those 
nations, in order to meet the 
IMPs stringent standards, must 
impose economic austerity 
measures which hun their 
people even more. According to 
UCSD's own Wayne Cornelius, 
Mexico's interest payments alone 
now total "$12 billion a year 
(and) take 37.5 percent of the 
total federal budget: 

The priority of the US 

out against the gross injustices of 
apartheid in South Africa , by a 
white minority government that 
is overjoyed at the prospect of 
further investment in their 
economy. Okay? 

This US national day of 
action , which was called for by 
the outlawed African National 
Congress, obviously does not sit 
well either with the UCSD Police 
Deparnnent or the 
administration. What could they 
be thinking? "The hell with the 
black, coloured, Indian, Asian 
and progressive white prisoners 
in South Africa; they don't need 
our suppon: What else is 
brewing in their brains? Is it 
something so callous and i\l-
informed as "One day of 
nationwide action will do 
nothing to help the plight of 
those prisoners?" Have they 
really gone so far as to believe 
.that an act so contrary to the 
democratic ideal, such as 
selective censorship, will begin 
the demise of totalitarianism 
throughout the world , let alone 
South Africa? 

You can be sure that if 
members of the South African 
government were informed that 
the denial of free speech was 
being employed as a tactic by 
universities in the United States 
to quell the uprise of student 
activism, they would stan 
rethinking their process of 
measly reform, and would 
possibly reven back to a policy 
of non-movable apartheid laws. 
For the student detentions on 
Friday night lead one to think 
that certain public officials in 
San Diego are not vety sincere or 
convicted when they speak of 
their "abhorrence of the system 
of apartheid in South Africa: 

government, perhaps the single 
most powerful actor on the global 
stage. should not be the 
mindless , uncontrolled pursuit of 
higher and higher technology for 
military purposes when so very 
many people in the world live in 
primitive material conditions. It 
should instead be to act in ways 
which promote a more equitable 
distribution of the technology 
and wealth which now exist. 
Children in Bolivia regularly die 
of diannea, which is simply 
unjustifiable. 1n Africa, 
conditions are far worse. We 
can, as a nation , make a decisive 
difference. Let us nOt continue in 
our tragically mistaken path . We 
can control technology rather 
than vice versa. We need not 
follow Mr. Reagan's regressive 
foreign policy measures. It is 
unconscious to continue 
pretending that the Third World 
does not exist and that our 
opulent standard of living is 
completely unrelated to its 
poverty and underdevelopment. 
Brief, flashy events, such as live 
Aid, are a step in the right 
direction as far as consciousness 
raising, but are certainly no 
substitute for more far-reaching 
effons thaI will eventually sever 
the Third World's dependence 
upon the developed countries -
at leas t to the extent that It is 
possible in an increasingly 
interdependent world .

A Homily to Young Activists 
By MICHAEL ROSSMAN 

homily, n.:( 1) A sennon, ... 
intended to edify a congregation on 
some practical matter. (2) A tedious 
moralizing lecture or admonition. 

by what you're learning ro do? 
It's here you bJ:gin . not in 

South Africa, but with what's 
wrong at home, and with your 
own needs. You get involved 
because you are a citizen, and 
you want to learn how to be a 

Dear R., 
I know you've been wondering 

whether you should get more 
involved in some SOrt of social 
activism this year, agai nst 
apanheid. the rape of Nicaragua, 
nuclear arms. or whatever - and 
wondering how ro convince your 
parents and yourself that 
involvement isn't just a costly 
distraction from your real job of 
being a student. 

good one. You act beca use your 
own country, your own state , 
your own school, are supponing 
something slightly less ugly than 
genocide, because the 
government of each is doing it 
with your money and in your 
name, ana won't stop until you 
help bring enough pressure to 
bear. As a political citize n, you 
work fo r divestment because 
ma ny levers are needed, and this 
one is handy and big, and 

So I hope you']] pardon me for 
offe ring some middle-aged 
perspectives on the matter. I 
wish I could advenise my homily 
as the gathered. npened wisdom 
of the Movement of the Sixties. 
But in truth , these ideas were at 
most a minority view, so at odds 
with customary pohtical rhetoric 
that we hardly knew how to 
explore them in public, It:t alone 
how ro realize them fully in 
practice. Yet they still seem 
essential to me, and for you. 
Some Core Issues 

Take anti-apanheid action, for 
example. You don't join the 
campus divestment movement 
just for altruistic reasons, for the 
sake of those poor oppressed 
black folks half the world away. 
You join it for selfish reasons -
for the sake of your own life , 
your own learning, your own 
soul. 

For the issue is yours as much 
as it is theirs. It has many layers, 
like an onion; it grows broader 
and deeper as you peel them 
away towards the personal core. 
First comes the husk, the issue 
of what happens within South 
Africa itself. Next comes the 
issue of US suppon for a 
tottering racist tyranny; and next. 
of the university'S complicity in 
this, through its investment 
policy. 

I'm sure you'll hear these outer 
layers dissected thoroughly at the 
noon rallies, but I hope the 
discussion goes deeper. For 
beneath the panicular question 
of divestment, the underlying 
issue concerns educational 
governance: How are the 
university's decisons made, by 
whom and for whom? And 
underlying this, for you, the issue 
grows personal. What does it 
mean, to be a citizen, not only of 
a democratic country and state, 
but of a community of learning? 
And who are you learning to be, 

maybe there's a chance of 
moving It . But as a citizen of a 
community of learning, you work 
for it for deeper reasons. 
About Educational Citizenship 

You don't do it to stop a great 
public university from betraying 
ItS humane mission, by investing 
in misery's institutionalization. 
You do it because the university's 
sense of mission itself dissolved 
before you were born, leaving 
you ro pursue your learning in a 
vast educational machinery 
geared to shape you ro fit the 
forces that shape it, govemed by 
the amoral fog of managers and 
technocrats: and because you 
long for some gesture of moral 
meaning, even so dry as 
divestment. to resonate through 
the whole of it - the machinery, 
the community - to make it feel 
like a proper home ground for 
your own quest to make 
something meaningful of life. 

To the institution . you're 
merely a student, an almost 
powerless cog in the machinery, 
if nO( just raw material at its 
mercies. You hardly know what 
else to call yourself, for the 
language of citizenship in a 
community of learning is as 
underdeveloped as the practice 
of educational democracy. Yet 
still you should know that this 
university is yours, in some deep 
and inalienable sense, won by 
your choice to shape yourself 
through its roils and thereby to 
help make it what it is. It's yours, 
and in the co- ownership and 
CO-citizenship, you have more 
rights and responsibilities than 
the institution's management 
recognizes, more than you grasp 
yet, more than you have power 
or wisdom to carry out. But you 
try anyway, because it's vital to 

your own learning. 
So you work for divestment 

because the university should be 
more responSive to the nerds of 
the people its operations affect 
- both in South Africa , and on 
campus. You work nOl only to 
change investment policy but to 
change the university itself - to 
ex tend and create mechaniSms 
of response, expectations of 
response, a culture of 
responsive ness [hroughout the 
institu[ion and its community. 
For [his case IS particular but the 
principle is general: You have the 
nsht to share In the decisons that 
alfect your life. 

How the financial future of 
your teachers is secured may 
seem, to administrators , hardly to 
affeq a student. But the decision 
has become a major factor in Ihe 
moral climate of your learnlng-
place. an Issue calling you to 
recognize and exercise your right 
10 participate - not only in thIS , 

I '.' L~ 

BORED? 
~V-'J.~ Don't be! 

but In whatever else affects you 
as a learner. 

For the right is si mple and 
indiVIsible , and applies to all 
your experience. You have the 
right to have a say, not only 
about which courses you choose 
10 build your program, but about 
whIch courses are offered in the 
first place for you to choose 
among. You have the right to 
have a say, not only about whIch 
teachers you seek or shun , but 
about which teachers are hired , 
retained , dismissed . You have 
[he right to have a say, not only 
about how you yourself cope 
WIth the process of each class, 
but about the way the class itself 
runs; nOl only about how you 
prepare for the test, but about 
how and why you wIll be tested; 
not only about which grade to 
work how hard for, but about 
how and why and whether you 
will be graded and Judged - all 
thiS, and so much more. 

"To have a say" means to 
partiCipate meaningfully, 
substantively, equitably. in such 
decisions. Of course , you hardly 
have any such right, if you go by 
the university's rulebooks or 
common customs. Still It remains 
inalienable, potential. How much 
of a say you should have, or 
want to have, and how ... well 
these are matters for working OUI 
In each issue, with the OIher 
people concerned . You have 
hardly begun to learn how, we 
have hardly begun. And above 
all , as a democratic citizen , you 
have the right to a responsive 
institution to help you learn - a 
school , a SOCiety, that doesn 't 
simply "serve" you in a passive 
sense , but actively encourages 
and enables you to learn with 
others, how to use and change it 
to meet your needs.

Grad school to delve into Pacific Basin 
Continued from page 1 

Dr. Peter Gourevitch, a key 
coordinator working toward the 
establishment of the unique 
interdiSCiplinary international 
relations school, says that after 
receiving approval from 
numerous committees and 
boards, UCSD may host its first 
group of students at a Paci fic 
Basin Graduate School as soon 
as the faD quarter of 1987. 

According to a summary of a 
US-page planning committee 
report, the proposed school 
would seek to create a distinctive 
fusion among the disciplines 
devoted to profeSSional training 
and research in international 
studies and management, to 
science and technology, and to 
culture and artistic expression. 
The summary also states that the 
initial emphasis for instruction 
and research would be placed on 
Japan, China and Latin America. 

Gourevitch said that the UCSD 
Pacific Basin School would be 
unique in the nation. There are 
no ot her international relations 
schools whose exclusive focus is 
the Pacific. "There's the 
Woodrow Wilson School in 
Princeton . .. Columbia has one 
. .. the fletcher School of Law 
and Diplomacy .. . the School of 
Advanced International Studies at 
John Hopkins University in 
Washington, OC , ... 
Historically those schools have 
been Atlantic in their focus." 

Gourevitch, a political science 

professor, is the chairperson of 
both UCSD faculty committees 
now overseeing the primary 
development of the international 
relations school. "One is (the) 
faculty steering committee whose 
job is to analyze the curriculum, 
to think about the connection 
between curriculum and faculty 
needs, and to analyze what the 
(faculry) recruitment needs are 
for the school and how they 
relate to the curriculum . . . . 
There's also an administrative 
working group whose job it is to 
supervise the approval process," 
he said . 

"The idea of th is school is to 
teach students about people who 
aren't ... middle-class 
Americans. Theater, music, 
communications, the ethnic 
studies programs, the 
international studies programs -
those are pieces of a large 
mosaic." Gourevitch explains that 
faculty from a wide va riel)' of 
UCSD departments have shown 
interest in the project. ·Paul 
Drake, from C[IAS (Center for 
Iberian and Latin American 
Studies) and Richard Madsen 
from Chinese Studies are on the 
steering committee." Members 
from the music , drama and 
communications departments 
have also expressed an interest. 

DOnald Wyman, acting 
director of US - Mexican 
Studies, stated his enthusiasm for 
the development of the ltf3C\uate 
school. "I think it's terrific that 

it's happening in San Diego, for 
the community and for the state . 
We have a diverse ethnic 
community and (a strong) 
economic community as well. 

"Most schools of international 
relations are on the East Coast. 
But if you want to study Latino 
or Asian Studies, you would 
come to the Pacific Basin 
school." 

There are three main 
conceptual eleme nts to the 
International Relations School. 
The first is "a degree program 
that can train people who want 
to pursue careers in international 
relations, particularly in the 
Pacinc area .... The University 
of California doesn 't have a 
graduate school of international 
relations of any kind and there 
is a strong demand by students 
nationwide for things like this: 
and there's a strong demand on 
the part of both public and 
privte employers to have people 
who have a very good 
background in international 
relations, language, cultures, 
societies, diplomacy .. . 
economics, some management 
skiDs, who can operate effectively 
in (the Pacific) area," Gourevitch 
said . 

The primary degree the school 
would offer is the Master of 
PaCific Basin International 
Relations. Beyond the bloc of 
core subjects in cross-cultural 
communications and 
management skiDs, the 

curriculum would require 
students to undertake a regional 
focus on a particular area of the 
basin. In addition , students 
would take courses in 
quantitative analysis and 
computer literacy, all within a 
two-year program. The summary 
said that three-year track would 
also be available for students to 
develop specializations and 
language skills. 

The second element "is to do 
research on the Pacific Basm." 
Gourevitch said . The summary 
hsts research tOpiCS ranging from 
International security to 
agriculture to religion and values. 
It also lists resource facilities 
near or at the San Diego campus 
including the Scripps Institute of 
Oceanography, the UCSD 
Program in Japanese Studies, and 
The Division of Engineering, 
among other. Gourevi tch 
emphasized that the Pacific 
Basin School would collaborate 
with other schools and programs 
in the UC system to perfonn 
research. 

"Third is to be a center of 
outreach," Gourevitch said. The 
sumrnary states that the school 
would be a center of public 
understanding and "international 
discussion among ... the 
peoples of the Pacific Basin on 
major issues of common 
concern ." A library of Pacific 
Basin International Relations and 
a building hOUSing faculry, 
classrooms and administration 

are inculuded in the graduate 
sc hool profosa!. "[ don't see thiS 
as a schoo whose exclusive 
function would be to tum out 
people who are gomg to become 
trade representative," Gourevitch 
said. 

Developing an international 
relations graduate school at 
UCSD has been talked about for 
some time. "It's an idea that's 
had several different sources: the 
one [ think is m.ost important is 
Roger Revelle . . . . About two 
years ago he drafted the concept 
of a school like thiS, and so 
there was some disc ussion of 
that at that time. But there were 
several people involved ," 
Gourevitch said. 

The planning process for the 
school began in December of 
1984. A committee of 12 faculty 
members met once a week at the 
beginning of the year, doing "a 
lot of work, revising drafts, and 
so forth ," Gourevitch said . In 
April , the planning committee 
submined their proposal to the 
UCSD Academic Senate which 
unanimously approved a 
resolution supporting the 
proposal for a graduate school.

seve rat committees of the 
University of California

the Guerrero g~p to continue to

prehistoric times, which has

when they began 10 form the city 
of Mexico a nd that the Spanish 
finished by filling in all the way." 

Mexican officials also knew of 
the earthquake danger, as well as 
the valley of Mexico's strange 
two-second resonance which is 
largely to blame for the damage 
in the area, Brune said. The only 
protective measure that could 
have been taken was the 

constru li o n of earthquake-safe, 
steel-framed bUildings with shbrt 
resonance periods. But there was 
no way, Brune stressed, that 
anyone could have predicted the 
coincidences that led to the 
catastrophic destruction . 

The earthquake, the ancient 
lake bed under Mexico, and 
many of the cheaper, concrete-
framed buildings in the city, aU 
had a similar resonance period, 
which means they were 
synchronized in such a way that 
the buildings gained energy like 
a child on a swing, swaying 
farther on each successive arc. 
Ultimately, those buildings 
reached their breaking point. 

"The question of whether or 
not buildings should have been 
deSigned for this, is an 
egineeri ng question that's going 
to rake a lot of STUdy over the 
next few years," Brune said . "But 
to understand how this kind of a 
tragedy could happen, I think

you need to take into account 
the historic perspective here. We 
have a record of earthquakes in 
Mexico only exte nding back a 
few hundred years. And the time 
which we've had good strong 
motion recordings of any 
earthquakes in the world extends 
only back to about 1930. And in 
Mexico Ciry, the vaUey of 
Mexico , there haven't been any 
good records of large 
earthquakes until this one. 

"This illustrates the urgency of 
trying to get this kind of 
information. If it had been 
known ahead of time, of course, 
we would have known that the 
valley of Mexico could uscillate 
this high and buildings could 
have been protected . .. . We hope 
10 be able to ... infer from this 
earthquake what will happen 
when the Guerrero gap itself 
eventually goes and maybe be 
able to take some action ahead 
of time to avoid the kind of 
building damage that occurred ." 

The team couldn't say if an 
earthquake with similar feaTUres 
could hit California , but no 
ancient lake bed like the one 
Mexico is built on exists here . 
Brune said Mexico has 
experienced many more 
earthquakes than California in 

the last hundred years; Mexico is 
a zone of very high seismicity. 
The length of the subduction 
thrust zone in MeXICO is about 
the same distance as the San 
Andreas fault here in Cali forma . 
"But so far this century there 
have been about 10 times as 
mimy magnitude 7.0 or greater 
earthquakes In Mexico as there 
have along the San And reas 
fault." 

Strong earthquake ground 
motions which have been 
recorded in California are, in 
several instances, more than five 
times stronger than those 
recorded in Mexico, Brune said . 
But in confirmation of reports, 
people who experiem;ed the 
quake said , "The shaking lasted a 
long time in this earthquake . The 
strong shaking might have been 
40 seconds long at the sites 
directly above the pan of the 
fault which ruptured ." 

Brune went to Mexico shortly 
after the eanhquake. His 
research assistants had gone 
earlier to check equipment and 
take aftershock measurements. 
He said he and coUeagues spent 
much of their time trying to 
understand why buildings were 
damaged the way they were, and 
to understand the ground motion 

records that they had taken in 
the vaUey of Mexico. . 

'To summarize, one of the 
interesting things that seems to 
come out of this is that the 
oscillation of the valley of Mexico 
was strongly concentrated at a 
period of two seconds. The 
ground moved up and down . . . 
in a rather unusual panem 
which we caU very uniform 
sinusoidal motion . 

"If you do a spectrum ... and 
figure out how much energy 
there is in different frequencies , 
it's stronltly concentrated at a 
period or two seconds. In 
discussions with the engineers, it 
became clear that almost aU. the 
buildings that were damaged or 
feU down had a period of around 
two seconds. 

"It rums out that the Mexicans 
and other people had established 
ahead of time that the resonant 
frequency of this layer of 
sediment was about two seconds. 
That means that you have 
various types of energy coming 
from a long distance propagating 
through the ground and then 
coming into the valley of Mexico; 
the vaOey of Mexico will oscillate 
like a bowl of jello at a frequency 
of about two seconds," Brune 
said. mJ

Student Entrenpreneurs: A New Trend 
By VAN HUTCHINSON 

The Idea is as simple as the 
logo, an international ban symhol 
suptrimposed on the word 
"hunger " But global 
consideranons aSide, UC D 
sophomore Don Canuthers 
focuses hiS campaign agamst 
hunger only on the late night 
stomach growlmgs of the UCSD 
dorm dweller. 

Food for Thought is the 
thought-provoking (and hunger-
provoking) name of Don's 
business, started laSt fall by Dan 
Klau and Keith Nieson. It 
became an answer to a problem 
recognized by every UCSD 
student who ever tried on foot to 
obtain late-evening fast food . 
With such a need just waiting to 
be fulfilled, Food for Thought 
stepped in with grand 
entrepreneurial style, offering 
Roberto's tacos and other hot 
food delivered to the customer's 
door. 

Don Cam.tthers' Food for 
Thought IS one representative of 
entrepreneurship among 
students, a national trend 
accumulanng in American 
colleges and universities in the 
mid-1980's. It is an inevitable 
trend, given the mood in 
America the last few years. For 
better or worse, it is the age of 
Reagan, the age of "yuppiedom," 
the age of the microcomputer. 
And for college students, it is the 
age where a growing, and already 
substantial, number of students 
have taken leave of traditional 
part-time Jobs in favor of 
beginning thier own enterprises. 

At Harvard, Wellesley, MIT, 
USC, UCLA. and the Babson 
cluster of schools student 
entrepreneurs have begun to take 
some of the more pragmauc 
matters of education into their 
own hands. A generation raised 
on remote control TV,

will not sit back and let slow-
tongued professors ruminate 
about the a bstractions of 
economic theory. They are 
discovering supply and demand 
and economies of scale in a 
practical way, by selling products 
and services in their own 
miniature business enterpnses. 

One not-so-mimature 
enterprise raised eyebrows on 
UCSD administration officials 
last year when it challenged the 
university bookstore's monopoly 
on required textbooks. In one of 
the most eye-arresting covers the 
Guardian has ever had, KB Books 
was depicted as a book-slinging 
DaVid facing a menacing Goliath, 
the UC Admmistration. 

Althought the initials KB stand 
for "kick back," KB Books is 
anythmg but lethargiC. Founder 
Ken Appel has found himself 
and his panners, Matt DeTeresa 
and Paul Martinelli , working as 
much as 12 hours a day in thier 
alternative bookstore. A spacious 
Side room of the Great Earth 

Vitamin store in Ralph's plaza 
houses the growing KB Books, 
which this quarter expanded its 
inventory of new and used books 
and began a buy-back service.

John Adams and Anthony 
Gonzales, proprietors of Del Mar 
Mobile Detailers. They speCialize 
in cleaning "Caddies" and 
polishing Porsches. Now in thier 
second year of business, they are 
looking to expand the clientele 
the corporate accounts. So tar, 
John and Anthony have mainly 
concentrated on building a 
reputation. John believes, 
"Reputation is number one. If 
you do poor work you won 't be 
around long." 

In many ways John Adams, 
Anthony Gonzales, Don 
Canuthers and Ken Appel and 
his partners are representative of 
a new breed of business-minded 
students, a trend that has been 
noted by a national expert on 
student entrpreneurship, Verne 
Hamish, founder of the 
Association of Collegiate 

entrepreneurs (ACE). 
He comments, "Students today 

want to be independent, and not 
part of the big establishment." In 
hiS research for an upcommg 
book on young entrepreneurs, 
including Apple Computers' 
Steve Jobs. Hamish found that 
entrepreneurs are not motivated 
primarily by money, but by 
challenge. They are idealistic in 
their dissatisfaction with big 
business and big government, yet 
are pragmatically focused on 
achieving status and financial 
security as quickly as possible. 

"Five years ago," Hamish 
notes, "the student 
entrepreneurship movement was 
mainly a coastal thing. Now it is 
nationwide, and there isn't a 
state we haven't heard from." In 
fact, the 2300 members, 
including faculty, graduate, and 
undergraduate students, plus a 
handful of high school age 
students, almost exactly 
correspond to US population 
distributions. 

Hamish estimates that there 

On the origins of Apartheid 
By ED SWAIN 

The first European settlement 
in South Africa was made by the 
Dutch in 1652 at the Cape of 
Good Hope. The settlement. at 
first merely a refreshment station 
for ships traveling around the 
Hom of Africa to the East, soon 
began to auract settlers in large 
numbers. These settlers drove 
deeper into the African 
continent, acquiring the name 
"trekboers: or wandenng 
farmers. They destroyed the 
mdigenous Bushmen and 
Hottentots in battles over land 
for grazmg and subsistence 
farmi ng In the 1770s, the Dutch 
trekboers met the Bantus at the 
Great Fish River, successfully 
overcame them and restricted 
them to reservations. In Natal, 
the Boers defeated the Zulus in 
1838 in the Battle of Blood River, 
and Natal was incorporated into 
the British South African colony. 
Soon, Transvaal and the Orange 
Free State were also brought 
un~r British/ Boer control. 

Up until the late 19th century. 
the <jau;h African economy was 
largely dominated by subsistence 

agricultue; but In 1867, 
diamonds were discovered, and 
later in the century gold was also 
discovered. Mining soon became 
a crucial part of the South 
African economy, which 
financed urbanization and the 
development of capitalist 
farmmg. 

This rapid economic growth , 
however, brought on problems. 
The immediate need for cheap 
labor for the mines led to the 
employment of many black 
workers from the reservations. 

In 1910, a constitution was 
given to South Afnca by the 
Brmsh, whic h forbade blacks 
from holdmg seats in parliament, 
although they could elect white 
representatives. Three years later, 
the Natives Land Act was passed , 
restncting black ownership of 
land to less than 10 percent of 
the total land In South Africa, 
although the black population 
was much greater than the white. 
ThiS began a major effort by 
whites to maintain white 
dommance and separation from 
the blacks under the L 910 

constitution. 
Black political organizations in 

South Africa had existed since 
the tum of the centuty, but there 
was never any strong, concerted 
organization which brought 
blacks together on a large scale 
for a unified purpose, until the 
convening of the South African 
Natives National Congress in 
1912. A response to the new 
South African Constitution's 
exclusLon of blacks from sitting 
on parliament, the Congress 
sought merely to allow blacks full 
and equal citizenship along With 
whltes. 

In L 917, Makgatho, opposing 
segregation In prinCiple in 
contrast to the more con ihatory 
Dube, became preSident of the 
ANC (African National Congress). 
Soon after thiS when World War 
I ended and South Africa got 
caught In a sharp international 
receSSIon, several black groups 
sought to gain economic and 
social improvement - through 
peaceful methods. In 1919, 
Meshach Peiem created the 
BantU Union in order LO seek 

benefits for blacks because of 
black efforts during the war; the 
endeavor was a failure. Charlotte 
Maxeke, in the same year, sought 
to effect change by a repeat of 
Mohacma Ghandi's protest 
against pass cards, but to no 
avail. Even the ANC, through 
passive resistance and strikes, 
had no effect. The mine owners 
cut the wages of whites and 
raised those of blacks to draw in 
more cheap black labor: white 
mine workers and Dutch 
Afrikaaner natlonahsts attempted 
to overthrow the government. 
ThiS resulted In total defeat for 
the rebels , but the resulting 
unpopulanty of the government 
brought It down in 1924, and 
brought to power a coalition of 
Afrikaaner Nationalists and the 
Labor Party. This coalition 
favored the demands of white 
workers and worked toward 
raCial segregation. The Industrial 
Conciliation Act of 1924, passed 
by th is coalition, favored the 
Employment of white workers 
and banned black unions. 

The Color Bar Act of 1924 

are approximately 750,000 high 
school and college age students 
runnmg theIr own bus messes. 
From thiS figure , It seems that 
student entrepreneurship IS 
attracting a large number of 
people. It is not surprising then 
that in the last several years 
steps have been taken to unite 
these entrepreneurs. 
~ The concept of uniting i entrepreneurs would seem 
:; unworkable to some, since 

~ entrepreneurs are portrayed as 
$;> "go-it-alone" cowboys. However, 

~ Hamish says contact with 
E: thousands of student 

entrepreneurs has convinced 
him that they desire contact and 
support from other students and 
faculty. This led to the fonnation 
of ACE, which has exploded 
from a half dozen students in 
1982 to 2300 in 1985. Purposely 
rejecting a bureaucratic structure, 
ACE serves as a network for 
putting student entrepreneurs in 
contact with one another. 

There are two main devices 
that accomplish such 
communication. One is the 
Electronic Network whereby 
members can send each other 
mail via computers and phone 
modems (similar to the UCSD 
VAXNMS and UNIX systems). 
The other, a national conference, 
encourages students and faculty 
to exchange business cards, cut 
deals and gain insight and 
motivation from tOp speakers. At 
the 1985 conference in Dallas, 
speakers included 26-year-old 
Brett Kingstone, author of The 
Student Entrepreneurs Guide and 
Art Zipper, publisher of Venture 
Magazine . In 1986, ACE hopes to 
auract such speakers as Fred 
Smith, founder of Federal 
Express, and John Naisbiu, 
author of Megatrends. ~

made apprenticeship to skilled 
trades impossihle for blacks so 
that whites could monopolize the 
higher-income jobs. 

During the Second World 
War, blacks expected their 
strong support of the war effort 
and patriotic service to result in 
greater social and political 
equality. Their disappointment 
led to a radical change in policy 
in 1943. The ANC suddenly 
made demands for an end to 
past laws and restricnons of 
movement, and demanded 
greater political participation. 

The white response to this 
was absolute intransigence 
toward black rights and a 
dedication, beginning in 1948 
with the election of the 
Nationahst Party to the policies 
of Apartheid , developed by H.F. 
Verwoerd, advocated total 
geographic separation of races: 
blacks would be put in "native 
homelands," or reservations from 
which they could not leave.

'Flower Lady': Counting the days 
By AIMEE DAUELL 

A SMALL TANNED face materialized among the animated flowers of red 
and yellow. The petite frame did 
not renounce the presence of a 
stately spirit. Her name is Aurora 
Evora, a flower merchant at 
UCSD who locates her stand 
next to the Gym each day. 

After meeting Aurora, I learned 
that she is a mother, a friend 
and most importantly a student 
of life. I commented on the 
friendly atmosphere prevalent at 

the flower stand and asked her 
how she maintained such a 
personal relationship with the 
students. A youthful shyness 
came over her, but quickly 
dissipated as she spoke. "I am 
very honest with the students, 
and they are honest with me. If I 
can do something for somebody 
I win. When I meet the people 
here, I feel like I've known them 
not for a short time but all my , 
life." 

Aurora has been known to 

bring food to share with the 
students she meets, allowing her 
stand to become a social hangout 
rather than merely a place of 
business. Aurora claims that she 
no longer has to worry about 
money because her children are 
college graduates, unlike earlier 
times wh~~ h~r clothing business 
In the Phlhppmes supplied the 
tumon to put her three children 
through UCSD. 

Aurora remarks, "The picnics, 
the park, the students and their 
families - money cannot buy 
those things. I love working here 
much more than working in an 
office. I feel as much a part of 
the university as the students." 

Aurora does nO! make a lot of 
money selling her flowers; but 
then again , it is not the 
monetary but the personal 
rewards she enjoys. She acts with 
spontaneous generOSity; although 
she usuaRy charges for the 
flowers, she sometimes just gives 
them away. 

Although her business is 
extremely important to her, 
Aurora is also concerned about 

t the students themselves. She 

is merely a business exchange, 
Aurora likes to get to know her 
clientele , giving them more than 
just flowers , but sound advice as 
well. A handful of students come 

to Aurora for counseling 
concerning thier relationship 
problems. Aurora admits, 
"Heartbroken people come to me 
and cry." One such story about a 
heartbroken student involved a 
young man who was attracted 
beyond extremes to a cenain 

youn~ woman. Aurora, concerned 
for thiS man and his dilemma 
decided to help. Whenever sh'e 
would see the woman pass by

her stand, Aurora would run up 
to her and hand her a flower. 
Aurora says that there are times 
when .her business gets extremely 
comphcated, especially when 
there's an influx of students 
seeking advice; yet she doesn't 
seem to mind. According to 
Aurora, love and flowers go hand 
in hand. 

Aurora Evora, "Love and flowers go hand in hand."

However, this year when we walk 
by the Revelle plaza in 
anticipation of seeing Aurora and 
her flower stand, she won't be 
there. Wh~? Policy change. 

The reVised Seller's Policy 
Co~tract fails to State any 
obViOUS reason for this sudden 
change. The new contract entitles 
Aurora to a total of six selling 
days ptr quarter, providing she 
is sponsored by a UCSD 
department or student 
organization. 

Aurora says that the revised 
Contract is largely due to 
previous problems between the 
universtiy and the vendors. She 
has talked with the initiators of 
the new policy. "They have told 
me , 'You're not a problem; we 
know you have followers, but we 
have to follow policy.'" The 
student body is doing their part 
to ~elp Aurora by circulating 
petitions calling for revision of 
the contract. 

Aurora is handling the new 
restrictions with optimism. She 
speaks of the good fortune she 
has had over the years. "I'm 
thanking God. I'm here and I'm 
happy, but I also hope I'm 
making other people happy." I 
asked her what the main reason 
for her happiness was. She 
replied, "I believe honesty and 
res pect for yourself come fi rst 
even before love, because once 
you learn to respect yourself, 
then you can love." Il:J

More than a Dleeting 
it's an adventure 
By JOHN SCHACHT, Sports EdItor 

L IKE LEMMINGS on their ritualistic migration to the cliffs from which they 
throw themselves to cenain 
death, UCSD's quanerly tradition 
known as the Intramural Team 
Captains has begun again. At the 
stan of each quaner, our fearless 
captains bring themselves into 
the ring of absurdity to cast their 
lot with fate and illogic in order 
to pantclpate In the madness 
known as - the Team Captains' 
Meetings. 

"We have to share time With PE 
classes, rec clubs, intercollegiate 
athletics, off-campus events and 
extension courses (which often 
use the gym), which leaves only 
a cenain amount of tlme for us. 
What we need are more 
facHities. " 

Help may be arriving In the 
form of a new athletic complex 
nonh of Third College, and this 
year the Third College field itself 
will go into use . But this may 
take away from the circus-like 
atmosphere of the Captains' 
Meetings, and no one would 
want that to happen. Or would 
they? 

Each quarter signals the stan 
of a great variety of intramural 
spons for all those weekend -
and weeknight at 11 - athletes 
who vie for the fame and glory 
of the championship photos, the 
prestige of the Bud Poll, and the 
rivalry and. camraderie of alcohol 
consumption - I mean friendly 
competition. 

The Team Captains' Meeting is 
a sport in and untO itself, as 
anyone who's had the pleasure, 
or misfonune - depending 
upon the toss of the coin - of 
panici pating can tell you. For 
those of you unfamiliar with this 
infuriating ritual, it proceeds in 
thiS fashion: a group of people 
are assembled into a tiny room 
where they are seated or stood 
for upwards of an hour while the 
rules and regulations are read to 
them from the great organizer of 
this event. These unfonunate 
souls are the ones who get stuck 
with the roster, team names and 
fellow teammates' lame excuses 
("Geez, I'd love to, but I just 
remembered I've gO! a class that 
night from 5 till midnight -
sorry.") 

At the football meeting last 
week, several people VOIced 
complaints about the system, 
although few offered any new 
suggestions. Ira Rubenste in has 
been through "at least a half-
dozen of these things ," and he 
drew the lucky # 1 at the football 
lottery. Tough luck for Ira, 
though; today the coin toss went 
[he other way. In other words, 
"We stan a[ #175 today." Ira, 
however, doesn't mind [he 
possibility of playing on a late 
Monday evening - if he's on 

The eXCitement generated by a Team Captain's meeting is mortili'ing. 

For his part, the great 
organ izer reads from the sacred 
scroll of il'\Cramural do's and 
dont's before casting the fate of 
200 people or so into the air on 
the wings of a 1977 quaner. As 
the coin flips toward the ground, 
the room is enveloped in 
pensive silence; but once it hits 
the ground, a loud groan can be 
heard from those at the low end 
of the scale. Now they can look 
forward to playing floor hockey 
at 1 ~ on a Monday. 

What sort of ritual is this 
where #175 goes first? Does 
tradition merely dictate that we 
do it because it's "always been 
done that way," or is there some 
perverse logic to it? Are there 
really bener ways? The man in-
charge - the great coin tosser 
- is Scott Bemdes, the oracle of 
intramural knowledge. 

·We feel that the coin toss 
and lottery is really the lesser of 
twO evils, the other one being 
the Instant Scheduling system 
that UC Davis uses ," said 
Bemdes, "which allows the team 
captains to scrawl their names 
on the times they want and chen 
fight it out for field time. It's a 
scheduler's nightmare ." Another 
reason for the lottety is , 
according to Bemdes, "the fact 
that it enables us to computerize 
the schedule and get all the 
captains together at one time 
and in one place." 

Aside from the arbitrariness of 
the coin toss, another complaint 
lodged by many captains 
concems the times available to 
play. But as Bemdes explains, it 
is the best they can do with 
what they have to work with . 

the list at all. "I've played at 1 am 
in floor hockey - I can handle 
it." 

One of Ira's complaints -
many others mentioned this as 
well - is that one method of 
beating the odds is to merely 
parade in the whole team, have 
them all fill out rosters and each 
choose a number out of the hat. 
You don't have to be Jimmy the 
Greek to know that this will 
improve your odds. Richard 
Reigel. who drew the first draw 

tPlis day (#175 of course) 
admitted that there is a "system 
to the ~)'stem: although he 
naturally denied knOwing what it 
was. 

Junior John Richardson felt 
that there was no real problem 
with the lottery other than that 
"ten guys per team with numbers 
is a few too many." Another 
disgruntled student, stuck in the 
middle of the numbers game, 
summed it up this way: "I should 
have cheated." But given the lack 
of alternatives, it seems that 
UCSD's intramural athletes are 
quite used to this ritual, and the 
Team Captains' Meetings will 
march on, For better or 
worse. 

The man, the style. the infamous coIn ross.

The beat goes on 
for Men's Soccer 
By CHRISTIANA KAUS 

A s THE 1985 season for the Triton men's soccer team slowly winds to an 
end, the possibility of a NCAA 
play-off benh is strong. "We are 
in very good shape right now," 
confirmed Coach Derek 
Armstrong. "We just have to get 
through a couple difficult 
opponents." 

Specifically , the Tritons face a 
Division I school , UC Irvine on 
Sunday, October 6, and Biola 
University on Wednesday, 
October 9. "Biola is the team to 
watch out for," said Armstrong. 
"'[.hey are notorious for creating 
upsets ." 

Although the team' is presemly 
in good shape, and undefeated, 
Coach Armstrong won't 
guarantee anything. ' We've had 
our normal knocks," he said, "but 
the depth on our team is 
enormous." Normal knocks this 

Coach Derek Annstrong 

season have included injuries , 
the beginning of classes and 
players holding outside jobs. 

One very important upcoming 
game is against La Veme ,

who decides the sites of the 
NCAA playoff games. "We want 

to Impress the NCAA and show 
that UCSD has what it takes to 
host a championship game." For 
the La Veme game, the field is 
being upgraded and extra 
bleachers added. Fortunately, the 
La Veme game comes at the end 
of another week break for the 

team; so the team should be 
ready. "We're taking every game 
as it is, but once we get through ' 
Biola, no one will stop us:

Hosts Finish 3rd 
in All-Cal Tourney 

WEEKLY SPORTS CALENDAR 

By DAMON MOSLER 
Over the weekend , UCSD's 

women's soccer team hosted a 
six-team All-Cal tournament. All 
the teams competing were from 
the UC system, including Davis, 
Irvine, Los Angeles, Riverside 
and Santa Cruz. The Tritons 
came into the tournament with a 
4-5-1 record. 

Coach Leaney felt that their 
chances were good for success 
over the weekend. In their last 
game on Tuesday against 
Division I Long Beach State, the 
girls lost a heanbreaker in the 
closing minutes, 1-0. The loss 
ended a five-game unbeaten 
streak for the Tritons.

UCSD opened the game 
strongly, quickly threatened the 
4gers goal and took play to Long 
Beach for much of the game. 
WIth JUSt a few moments 
remaining, however, the Tritons 
lost control and Long Beach 
scored from 30 yards just when 
it looked as though UCSD was 
going to score, themselves. 

With such a strong showing, 
Leaney felt the team would do 
well against lesser tearns such as 
Riverside and Santa Cruz. 
Tougher opponents would prove 
"difficult to beat," according to 
Leaney, and he listed INine and 
UCLA as the teams to beat in the 
tourney. 

Coach Leaney's inclinations 
were nght on line as the Tritons 
blasted the girls from Riverside 
in the first round, 9-0. Goalie 
Erin Aefedt put in an awesome 
first half shutting out Riverside. 
Most of the game was played by 
Leaney's second string, highlights 
including a hat trick by Junior 
Lynn Bailey. The second half was 
highlighted by Freshman Ann 
Moses in her shutout 
performance at goalie. The 
outstanding success of the girls 

did nOl carry fonh to the 
second-round game against 
Davis where the Tritons feU 2-0. 
The stronger Division II Davis 
team was pushed hard by the 
Tritons but prevailed in the end. 

The loss pairs the Tritons with 
a rematch against Irvine, who 
earlier this season beat the less 
experienced UCSD team 3-0. 
The tcam has improved since 
then and will prove a more 
formidable foe this second time 
around . 

In other action, UCLA won 
their round by defeating Santa 
Cruz 3-0 and tying Irvine 1-1. 
Davis beat Riverside 6-0, and 
Irvine tied both their games 1-1. 
The match between Irvine and 
UCLA was an unfriendly affair 
with much debate over the 
offiCiating. 

After the tournament, UCSD 
faces five tough games before 
finishing with three easier ones 
to close out the regular season. 
Coach Leaney expects great 
things in the future as the 
Tritons and Division III soccer 
go national next year. 

At this pOint, Leaney feels that 
his team is "one of the three best

- if not the best - Division III 
teams In the nation." His high 
hopes are not unjustified with 
many freshmen on the team who 
will be playing for Leaney the 
next lew years. 

Saturday the women's team 
defeated UC Irvine 2-1 to avenge 
an early season loss and gain the 
third spot in the All-Cal 
tournament. In finishing the 
tournament 2-1, UCSD also 
improved its record to 6-5-1, the 
first time in four years that the 
women's team has reached the 
.SOO plateau. 

Goalie Erin Aafedt - in her 
founh ye\lr with Leaney, felt that 
the game against (rvine merely 
epitomized how much the 
Tritons have matured sinc'e that 
early first game. "Our emire style 
of play is JUSt far more 
sophisticated now," she said . 
"Our passing game has improved 
too. (t's just nice to be winning 
for once." 

Leaney's team got their goals 
Saturday from Lynn Bailey -
their leading scorer - and 
Adriene Clark who scored the 
game-winner with seven minutes 
left.

of the proposal. 

Gard ner will eventually make a 
r('commendation either 
approving or rejecting the 
proposal. If approved , the 
proposal will be given to the UC 
Board of Regents which has final 

say on the establishment uf the 
school at UCSD. 

"It would be a mistake for the 
committees to reject the 
proposal." Wyman said . 

Formal proposals for degree 
programs will be made next year, 
according to Gourevitch. The 
concept of the graduate sc hool 
and the proposal of degrees 
require twO separate approval 
processes. 

"The follOWing year, '87-'88, we 
will admit the first group of 
students. We're projecting a 
small number - about thirty -
and then we Will grow . . . 
Every year we will be admitting 
larger and larger classes until 
reaching full strength In '91-'92 ," 
Gourevitch said. The report 
summary estimates employing 50 
faculty members for a school of 
400 students. 

The ramifications of 
establishing the Pacific Basin 
Graduate School could be great, 
propagating through UCSD to 
the undergraduate level. 
Gourevitch said, "This is going to 
be a very useful way of 
organizing all these pteces which 
aren't coordinated , which have 
no central focus. We're planning 
this as a graduate school, but

campus will interact very weU 
with ethnic studies ... 1 can see 
ways that they can help and 
reinforce each other. 

and had 
AT&T's 60% and 4O%crlSCOUllls, 
it would have been a terrible 

loss for English lilel'CIlure. 

And of course, she wouldn't have had to 
restrict her feelings to a mere sonnet's 
length, either. 

After all, you can always think of one 
more way to tell someone you love them 
when you're on the phone. 

Let us count the ways you can save. 
Just call weekends till 5pm Sundays, or 
from llpm to Bam, Sunday through Friday, 
and you11 save 60% off AThT's Day Rate

on your state-to-state calls. 
Call between 5pm and Ilpm, Sunday 

through Friday, and you11 save 40% on your 
state-to-state calls. 

So when you're asked to choose a long 
distance company, choose AThT. Because 
with AThTs 60% and 40% discounts, you 
can satisfy your heart's desire without 
exhausting your means. 
Reach out and touch someone.
