D •• tructlon - While a large number of trees fell victim to winds of up to 64 mph in the storm two 
weeks ago, apparently the only damage to buildings was a small rip in the roof of a classroom. 

Weathering the storm 
Administration 
response slowed 
by the city 
By ANNA MARIE BEZZERIDES 

While the UCSD campus was 
ubjected to serious public health 

and safety problems from a more 
than bO percent drop in water 
pressure, an emergency decision 
by the chancellor's office to shut 
down the campus was delayed by 
the city water company until 
mid-morning Tuesday, Jan. 19. 

According to Associate Vice 
Chancellor George Himel, after 
the initial drop in pressure Sun-
day afternoon, he received assu-
rances from the city that the 
water supply was being re-routed 
and the campus would be suffi-
ciently supplied. However, after 
arriving on campus early Tues-
day morning, Himel and other 
campus officials became aware 
of how serious conditions really 
were. 

"We were delayed because the 
city water people didn't know 
where the water main was 
broken," said Scott Wilson of 
the UCSD Environmental Health 
and Safety Department. 

After Himsel and his supervi-
sor, Vice Chancellor Steven 
Relyea, gathered information 
Tuesday morning from the Phys-
ical Plant Services and the 
Enviro.nmental Health and 
Safety Department, Himel and 
Relyea recommended to Chan-
cellor Atkinson what Himel 
called "a decision that had to be 
made and the only one that could 
be made." 

The goal of reducing the 
amount of people on the campus 
to a minimum was based on con-
cerns for health and safety of all 
those involved. With the lack of 
water pressure "we [the adminis-
tration] could not ensure proper 
sanitary and safety conditions," 
Himel said. There was not only 
insufficient sanitation facilities 
available, but there were dangers

Some say the 
surviving trees 
are still unsafe 
By MATT EDMONDSON 

Most of the damage caused by 
the storm that hit UCSD two 
weeks ago consisted of trees 
knocked down by the wind, and 
it may still be dangerou alk 
through wooded ana! of cam-
pus, according to campus main-
tenance workers. 

"The most damage to the 
campus was done by trees blow-
ing over," said Assistant Envi-
ronmental and Health Service 
Technologist Bill Bernard . 
"We're fortunate that it happened 
on Sunday. If the campus had 
been in heavy use, there could 
have been serious injuries." 

"The Crafts Center [near the 
Student Center] had a tree that 
crashed into a classroom," said

Wicker talks party politics 
By LINDA GLAVE 
Stall Writer 

Tom Wicker, noted political 
columnist for the New York 
Times, gave two public lectures 
last week on the state of Ameri-
can politics. 

Wicker began his career in 
journalism at the Sandhill Citi-
zen in 1949. After various posi-
tions at a number of newspapers 
and a job as public information 
director on the North Carolina 
Board of Public Wefare in 
Raleigh, Wicker worked for the 
Winston-Salem Journal for eight 
years. At one point he was the 
paper' ports editor, a stint 
which he calls "mercifully short-

eQ&A 
H ow well did the 

lived." He became a Washington 
correspondent at the Journal in 
1957. Following a position as 
associate editor for the Nashville 
Tennesseean, Wicker was a staff 
member of the New York Times 
Washington bureau from 1960 
to 1964, and chief of the bureau 
from 1964 to 1968. He began 
writing his nationally syndicated 
column In the Nation in 1966, 
and continue to write In the 
Nation for the Op-Ed page on a 
twice-weekly basis. 

Wicker was invited to UCSD 
a a Regents' Lecturer by the his-
tory department. On Tuesday 
evening, after an introduction by 
department chair Michael Par-
rish. during which the audience 

heartily applauded the fact that 
Wicker's name had appeared on 
then-President Nixon's enemies 
list, Wicker delivered a detailed 
lecture on both political parties 
in general and the RepUblican 
party in particular. 

Wicker stated that while the 
national political trend appeared 
to be that more of the population 
was oting RepUblican, what had 
really happened is that since 
1968, the RepUblicans have 
become the party of government 
and the Democrat the party of 
acces . 

He pointed out that in four 
out of the last five national elec-
tion the Republican party had

$37 million 
Library addition 
money approved -

By JACK BERESFORD 
Guardian Intern 

The UC Regents have ap-
proved an alternative architectu-
ral design plan for the proposed 
$37 million addition to Central 
Library . The decision. made by 
the Regent Committee of 
Grounds and Buildings Jan . 15, 
will e sentially double the size of 
the library without significantly 
altering the de ign of the existing 
facility. 

The initial plan , created by 
architect Gunnar Birkert , was 
opposed by many faculty member 
including Dr. Roger Revelle and 
Dr. Walter Heller, co-chair of 
the Campus and Community 
Planning Committee. Their con-
cern was that the new design , 
which would have risen four 
floor in front of the library, 
would completely destroy the 
original effect of the triking 
diamond- haped building. 

The original design, created 17 
years ago by the late William 
Pereira, i a six-story glass tower 
that ha become a popular sym-
bol for UCSD. 

After hearing objections to 
Birkert's first plan, U CS D Chan-
cellor Richard Atkinson re-
quested that the architect de ign 
an alternative plan that would 
not rise above the forum level. 
The alternative plan approved 
by the Regents consists of a two-
tory U-shaped design, the first 

floor to be sub-level, and the 
second to be covered with earth 

so it appears to be underground . 
The library extension will con-

tain 195,500 gro s square feet, 
with 136,850 assignable quare 
feet to house the operations of 
the Central Library and the 
Science and Engineering Library. 

Dr. Heller strongly supports 
thi alternative design , which 
alters only the forum level and 
not the glass tower. "The final 
plan is an equally spectacular 
design concept a the original 
without disturbing the powerful 
image of the libary, to Heller aid. 
"We hired a good architect and 
he came through. to 

The next step, according to 
associate architect John Sturla, 
i the authorization of an execu-
tive architect to make final re-
finements to the plan . 

Groundbreaking is scheduled 
for the fall of 1989 and construc-
tion will last two year . Accord-
ing to Sturla there may be incon-
veniences during this time, such 
as alternative entrances, but the 
library will remain open. 

When asked about the envir-
onmental impact of the con-
struction, Dr. Heller said that 
there may be some problems 
with tree removal: "There won't 
be much room for trees - so 
you'll have a very powerful 
spaceship sitting there alone. to 

Completion of the project is 
scheduled for late 1991. Draw-
ings of the new design are on 
display near the main entrance 
of the library. (Q]

Vacant U C Regent seat 
awaits nomination 

tate a nd univer ity officials are 
uncertain who will fill the vacancy on 
the UC Board of Regents left by lasl 
month's death of Regent Sheldon 
Andelson due to complications of 
AIDS. 

Gov. George Deukmejian is respon-
sible for nominating a candidate to fill 
the opening on the board . which over-
sees all aspects of the univer ity, but 
according to a spokesperson from the 
governor's office. no action has yet 
been taken to find a replacement. 

Although the nomination will prob-
ably be made by June, the governor 
has not set up any schedule for the 
selection process or considered any 
candidates. the spokesperson said . 

Vice chair of the board of regents. 
Ron Brophy. said he expects the gov-
ernor to nominate an additional can-
didate when Deukmejian is scheduled 
to nominate ca ndidates to replace four 
regents who e terms expire that 
month. 

Brophy said he believes that the 
vacancy left by Andelson's death will 
not cause any problems with the effec-
tive functioning of the regents . 

Bro phy added that Andelson "will 
be missed . He wa a very bright man.

UCSD Cancer Center 
hosts Intl conference 

Leading cancer re earchers from the 
Uni ted States, Europe , Australia. and 
Asia will convene in San Diego next 
month to present their lates t res ults 
from cli nical trials using immunicon-
jugates - genetically engineered 
a ntibodies linked to drugs, to xi ns or 
radioisotopes. 

The third annual International Co n-
ference on Monoclonal AntibOdy 
Immun oconjugates for Cancer, spon-
sored by the UCSD Cancer Center, 
will be held Thursday, Feb. 4 to Sat-
urday, Feb. 6 at the San Diego Marri-
ott Hotel and Marina , fo rmerly the 
Hotel Intercontinental. 

The UC 0 Cancer Center confer-
ence. which is the only one in the 
world that emphasizes clinical studies 
of monoclonal antibody immunocon-
jugates, is designed to attract represen-
tatives from business and government, 
as well as academe, according to con-
ference co-chairman Ivo r Royston, 
M.D., of the UCS D Cancer Center. 

This year conference d irectors have 
added a new sessio n called "current 
issues," which is designed to "provide 
a forum for leading scientists to grap-
ple with problems encountered in 
using immunoconjugates, independent 
of whether they are radioisotopes, tox-
ins or drugs," Royston said. 

One of the key issues is how to best 

deal with the heterogeneity of tumor 
cells, or the tendency for cancer cells 
within a si ngle tumor to be different 
from one another. 

Following the UCSD Cancer Center 
co nference. on Sunday, Feb. 7. will be 
a monoclonal antibodies seminar on 
brain tumor research, sponsored by 
the Preuss Foundation for Brain 
Rumor Research . During the one-day 
seminar invited scientists will meet in 
an infor~al , closed-door sessio~ to 
discuss promising new avenues for 
success and to engage in a "freewheel-
ing exchange of ideas," according to 
Ro yston. 

Los Alamos developing ways 
to measure superconductors 

Researchers at Los Alamos 
National Laboratory are developing 
two innovative techniques to measure 
the efficiency of new high-temperature 
superconducting materials . 

The work co nducted by the lab's 
Medium-Energy Physics and Accelera-
tor Technology divisions, is a crucial 
ingredient in the race to create a new 
generation of supercond.ucting 

. materials. 
Both measurement techniques use 

radio-frequency waves to determine 
whether specific supercond uctors 
really measure up. Other measurement 
methods have relied on electrical con-
tacts to gather data on super-
conductor . 

The two approaches can piggyback 
each other and are already being used 
to measure the performance of new 
superconductors . Those superconduc-
tors are being developed in separate 
research programs in the lab's Center 
for Materials Science and in the Mate-
rials Science and Technology division. 

Cal Grant applications

$1500 allocated for Black History Month 
By ELAINE SMOLER 
Stll/f Writer 

Allocations for Black History 
Month cultural events and allo-
cations to send students to the 
UCSA (University of California 
Student Association) Legislative 
Conference were the focus at the 
A.S . meeting last Wesnesday 
night. 

The AASU (African Ameri-
can Student Union) is bringing 

Lerone Bennett, a prominent 
journalist, and Alvin Poussaint , 
M.D. , a psychiatrist and activist , 
to U CS 0 to speak Oft issues rele-
vantto Black History. Th'e AASU 
requested $1500.00 from A.S. 
funds. which is matched by funds 
from SAAC (Student Affirma-
tive Action Committee), but they 
still have to solicit S21oo.00 from 
other campus sources. 

Robert Frankl, vice president 
of finance , motioned an amend-

ment which would force the 
money to only go towards the 
cost to bring the speakers to 
UCSD, but not for expenses 
such as receptions , and lodging. 
Frankl could not be reached for 
comment. 

This motion failed , but then 
Frankl motioned an amendment 
that would force the AAS U to 
return any unused money to the 
A.S. budget. The amendment 
narrowly passed, as did the allo-

Water main still broken 
Continued from pale 1 
of fire and chemical spills in labs 
that would pe impossible to deal 
with. 

The population on campus was 
drastically reduced - from 
around 25,000 (including visitors, 
students and staff) to approxi-
mately 4,000 residents, emerg-
ency staff and other people 
remaining on campus after 
classes were cancelled. The pop-
ulation reduction helped con-
serve water forthe use of the res-
idents who had to remain on 
campus. 

In addition, Himel added , 
"there were only 200 portable 
toilets installed for the whole 
campus. Just that alone is enough 
to see the importance of bringing 
down the campus population." 

Because the campus is con-
structed in a way that Himel des-
cribed as a "small city" made up 

of high-rise buildings and large 
complexes of buildings, a high 
water pressure standard is neces-
sary. According to Mort Shaye-
gan of Physical Plant Services, 
water coming into the campus 
is pressurized at 40-60 psi but a 
water pressure of 95-100 psi is 
needed for fire protection and 
for the high-rise bUildings. 

To raise the pressure and keep 
it constant, especially during 
"peak" hours, the Physical Plant 
has a pressure booster station . 
However, if the water pressure 
ever drops below 30 psi, the sta-
tion automatically shuts down, 
leaving the campus with only a 
gravity system of pressure. This 
is what happened Sunday after-
noon when the water pipe that 
supplies the campus from Mira-
mar Lake broke, resulting in lit-
tle or no water pressure for most 
of the campus. 

With the pressure booster sta-

tion shut down and the campus 
waiting for a temporary re-
routing by the city, Himel ad mit-
ted that "a fire , in Tioga Hall , for 
;nstance, could be contained but 
not put out instantly." 

To make up for the lack of 
water and pressure, the fire 
department moved fire trucks 
close by to be prepared for an 
emergency. So, the result was, in 
Himel's words, "not an unaccep-
table hazard ." 

At this point, the campus' 
water is still being temporarily 
re-routed , while awaiting the 
city's repair of the main line. 
Himel concluded that as a result 
of this disaster the campus is bet-
ter because the administration 
now knows how to carry out 
emergency plans such as evacu-
ating the campus and, currently, 
future emergency plans are being 
made with that knowledge. [0

Problems delayed 
Tipsy Taxi service 
By ELAINE SMOLER -
Stll/f Writer 

Students who depended on Tipsy Taxi the first weekend it 
was supposed to be in operation were stranded because the 
Yellow Cab Company refused to start service before they 
received payment from the A.S. business office. 

Even though a budget proposal was signed and an agreement 
Was made to begin the service that weekend , the dispatchers 
told UCSD callers that the service hadn't started yet. 

" As far as we knew, everything was go," said Johnny Patter-
so n, Commissioner of Operations, Services and Enterprises 
and the student negotiator for the service. 

There was, however, a discrepancy regarding the billing 
between the executives at the Yellow Cab Company. They 
ultimately decided that they would not bill monthly as they did 
last year, but that the service would only begin once they 
received a payment. The Yellow Cab Company declined to 
comment on their decision. 

The A.S. office sent a check and the service is now in 
operation . 

Patterson sent leiters to organizations on campus alarming 
them that there was a foul-up with the service before that first 
weekend. 

The Tipsy Taxi service is provided by A.S. funds for students 
to use on weekends as an alternative to drivi ng while intoxi-
cated. Students can use the service for no charge with a special 
ca rd available in the A.S. office and their UCSD identification 
card . ~

Kerry Blant 
Kerry Slant returned to school full -t ime two year 

ago a t 40: a father, Vietna m vetera n, former rea l 
estate broker a nd fo rmer rock a nd roll drifter. 

He quickly made h imself kno wn as a lively, 
e ne rgetic man, not afraid to open his feelings and 
life, no t afra id to sta nd fo r wha t he believes in 
politically and socially. Ke rry is, for exa mple, the 
fo unding m embe r of Friend s of Nicaraguan Culture 
a t UCSD, a group d ed icated to counter ing Reagan-
ist propaganda. 

Two weeks ago, Kerry's 14-year-old son Ke rry 
Galen, " KG" t o most wh o knew h im, committed 
suicid e for reaso n that can be discussed but never 
fully known. 

The traged y has touched a ll of Kerry's man y, 
ma n y frie nd s. S o me are getti ng t he c ha nce to return 
the love a nd energy Kerry has provid ed them . 

" Peop le wh o get involved with these k ind o f 
[activists] groups," Kerry says, " tend to be car ing, 
giving people. They've been there fo r m e in a b ig 
way. " 

Through his grief, Kerry has been willi ng to tal k 
with frie nds a bo ut what has happened, mot ivated 
by the grievi ng process and a de i re to help o thers 
contemplating suicide, to let them k now tha t they 
don't have to feel isola ted a nd alo ne. 

Kerry's experience has remind ed many of his 
friends who are also older students with children of 
the sudden and inexplicable ways their crowded 
live can be et asunder. 

"Life seemed to be going well fo r both of us," 
Kerry ays of he and KG. 

Kerry was in an eight-and-a-half year relationship, 
had sole custody of KG and got enough financial aid 
to support himself. Returning as an Engin~ering 
student, he switched to and has excelled at an Urban 
Studies and Planning major. 

KG was a thoughtful, well-mannered boy who 
joined his father in political activism, was doing 
better than ever in school and made friends quickly. 
He was bright e nough to inspire complaints trom 
one classmate that, "I can never beat him at che s." 

We wish to join all of Kerry's frie nds a nd 
colleagues in expressing our condolances over the 
loss of KG. We'd like to mix thosecondolances with 
admiration for what Kerry has accomplished and 
what he still wants to do . 

Kerry is currently attending a weekly gro up ca lled 
Survivors of Suicide (" It seems like two yea rs 
between the meetings"), ex plo ring g r ief counseling 
and sticking out school, not least to mai ntain h is 
fina ncial aid . 

After g ra d uation, he p lans t o d o wor k for 
OXF A M , a T hird World re lief proj ec t designed to 
help communities realize t heir own po te nt ial rat her

nologies t hat initiate cycles of dependence.

"Swim Fags" 
Objectionable 
Editor: 

The Budweiser beer ad in a recent 
i ue of the Guardian, featuring an 
intramural basketball team called 
"Swim Fag," disturbs me. No ne of 
the player pictured uses his real 
name. Their clot hes are pu rposef u lIy 
ridiculous, and the words im ply gay 
people can't play sports. Fueled by 
religious bigotry and rig ht-wing 
politics, the pe rsec ution of homo-
sexuals i on t he rise. Ads such as 
this o n.e just feed the hatred . 

T he thi ng that really bot hers me is 
the associatio n made between alco-
hol use and ho mopho bic insults, 
suggesti ng that it is all j ust fu n a nd 
games. Violent ph ysical a ttac ks 
against innocent gay people have 
more than dou bled in the last couple 
of years, a nd drink ing is a major fac-
tor in these a ttac ks. 

Just the name by itself, "Swim 
Fags," is unfort unate. I'm a UCSD 
student and a ho mosexua l. I'd like to 
think that I ca n pa rt icipate in 
intra mural sports wi thout having to 
end ure prejUdice, a nd that others 
can too. Several of the other team 
na mes seem to insult Blacks or 
women (e.g., " Killer Pygmies Death 
Grip '') as we ll. 

Hum or is grea t. Sports a re fun . 
There's no reaso n fo r them to insult 
people and shut them out of part ic i-
patio n. I encourage you r adverti se rs 
a nd edi tors, a nd all of us, to try 
hard er to be aware of the painful 
effects ou r words and actio ns may 
have o n others.

Parking Cops 
Too Tough 
Editor: 

Convenient parking at UCS D, as 
we a ll kn ow, is s till a large problem, 
and ca n be ex pensive. T he parking 
enforcement office rs are very effi-
cie nt a nd , I da re say, cruel. T he 
ligh tes t error wi ll not be to lerated 

and is rigorously fi ned. 
Two instances in particular remain 

fresh in my mind. On one occasion, 
whe n I was ~ait ing in the car at the 
red permit parking lOne to pick up 
my roommate, a "justice enfo rcer," 
secretly hidi ng behind some ca rs, 
wrote me a ticket, threw it in my 
window, ran off to her vehicle a nd 
quickly drove off to avoid a ny pro-

tes t on my part. Wouldn't just telling 
me to move do the j ob? Was thi 
rea lly just? 

Another incident occurred in ex-
t raordinary ci rcumstances which I 
believe reflects the pa rticular charac-
ter of the UCSD pa rk ing enfo rce-
ment department. I paid for the 
metered parking space for the time I 
left my car t here, but still received , to 
my great surprise. a $20 ticket for 
pa rk ing backwards. Was that cita-
tio n rea lly serving the good of the 
p ublic? Wha t hazard did my ca r 
cause to the publ ic safety? T here is a 
shortage of reasonable park ing and 
at t imes peo ple may be forced to 

park illegally for a short period of 
ti me. The pa rking officers spot and 
ci te these " ba ndits" immediately for 
su ms often more than $20. 

Let me make a suggestion to you 
a ll out the re. If you find yourself in a 
"forbidden" pa rk ing space, take the 
stud en I pa rking permit off your 
das hboard. The tickets a re $20 wit h 
a nd only $ 14 wi thout the ye llow 
permit. Does that ma ke se nse to 
yo u? Vio lators who paid for yello w 
parking zo nes pay more than people 
who d idn't! Sc hoo l sells a lot more 
parking permits than there a re avai l-
a ble spaces, so, in a se nse, the stu-
dents are paying money for non-
existent spaces. 

WbyNo 
Coverage 
Of Rally? 

It Not all of us have the same finan-
cial resources, and , for me, that $20 
ticket meant fi ve hours of work; 
that 's about two days of food on my 
budget. Wouldn 't a warning be a 
better way of dealing with th e 
situation? 

Editor: 
I was one of the 800 to attend 

the Jan. 23 anti-Contra rally 
o rganized by, amongst others, 
the Central American Informa-
tion Center. 

As an event, its operation 
was immaculate and the at-
mosphere throughout was to-
tally conducive to its ultimate 

ai~ - peace in Central Am-
erica . 

Those who attended un-
daunted by the banks looming 
before them in downtown San 
Diego provided , for once, an 
aud ible a nd visual display of 
opposition to American "in-
volvement" in Central Ameri-
ca. It was more than just an 
a nomalou s c ry for peace 
coming from within Califor-
nia's conservative capital. 

Considering the immensity 
of the issue, the passion of the 
pa rticipants a nd the sincerity of 
thei r song, I was dismayed when 
I ca me to observe the Guard-
ian 's coverage. As per usual , 
the non-commital stance of the 
pa per purportedly iss ued fo r 
students, by students did not 
cover in any detail the event or 
t he surrounding iss ues. A few 
lines and a photograph do not 
d o justice to the sincerity of the 
growing mass who support the 
ma rchers' ca ll for peace. 

I a m forced to co nsider one 
of two things. Either, hopefully, 
th e Guardian lacks guts and is 
failing the student po pulatio n 

or worse, the students a t UCS D 
do n't ca re. Let's hope it's the 
former . 

Ian Hagg 

Occurrences such as these make 
the police unpopular with the public. 
A policeman 's job is to secure the 
good of the public, yet all the people 
I've talked to - and I believe mo~t of 
you will agree - think these situa-
tions do not enforce that belief. The 
cost of park ing cita tions is outrage-
ous and their enforcement is fanati-
cal. Is th is done to collect money or 
enforce parking? Is it a kind oflegal 
robbery? I wonder what measures 
would be taken if the parking offic-
ers were left unchecked? Would 
harsher tactics 500n prove to be 
more effective than citations? 

Let 's now look into the options 
that the victim has in case s(he) is 
determined to fight the ticket. First, 
one ha s to set a trial date and set bl\il 
on the fine _ Next step is to lose half a 
day of work, and work equals money, 
in court pleading not guilty, setting 
another trial date and coming to 
court again. There, you throw your 
sob story at the judge against the 
respected and professional descrip-
tion of the situation by the law-
abiding officer, backed up by evi-
dence written on the ticket. Will 
many of the violators be willing to 
lose three days to settle such a matter 
without being sure of the outcome? I 
don 't think many can afford to. 

No one I know is content with the 
parking enforcement situation. Mind 
you, I have tried to plead at the sta-
t ion about the a bove-mentioned ci t-
a tions but, of course, was refu sed . I 
encourage the read er to put in thei r 
opini ons and voice any comments or 
feelings you may have a bout thi s 
iss ue. I would a pprec ia te the input 
of ot hers, incl ud ing the pa rk ing 
depart ment of the UC D police.

OPINION 

Q&A 
Do you think the administration handled the storm problems effectively? 

I dO n 'l think thaI the)' were very 
effective at all because they didn'l 
gel the WUl er (dr illking wuter) to u ~ 
fast enough and having the /Dilels 
bucked up fo r so 10llg was a heall It 
risk. II went oul Sun do)' and rhe)'

Damage 
Continued from pale I 
Martinez. "There were a lot of 
trees that fell. The next storm 
will bring down a lot more." 

Other than the Crafts Center, 
there did ' not appear to be any 
buildings on campus damaged 
by the storm. 

.. The tree trimmers were called 
in to start hauling away trees at 2 
am Monday morning," said a 
maintenance mechanic who 
wished to remain anonymous. 
"These trees are top-heavy, with 
shallow roots. The tree trimmers 
are constantly working. [But] 

I've only seen one truck on cam-. 
pus equipped to cut them." 

"The tree trimmers emphas-
ized how weak some of the trees 
still are," said Martinez. "They 
eve n went as far as to recom-
mend that no one walk through 
the woods . Those trees can still 
go." 

The administration has learned 
a great deal in terms of how to 
react to these types of disas ters, 
according to Bernard . 

" I think the campus is safer 
now," Bernard said . "Most of 
the weaker branches have been 
taken off by the storm itself." 

The maintenance mechanic 
does not see it that way, how-
ever: "The only thing they ca n 

really do is trim the trees , but 
there is not enough equipment to 
do that ," 

Another area of the campus, 
the Scripps Institute of Oceano-
graphy, found itself without 
power on Saturday, Jan . 16. " We 
had to utilize emergency power 
in order to keep the water flow-
ing in the aquariums." said elec-
trician Bill Scanlon. 

On the upper campus, "trees 
fell , knocking down the power 
lines at the Third College tennis 
courts," Scanlon added . There 
were no fires caused by electrical 
wires being knocked down. Nine-
ty-five percent of all electrical 
wiring runs underground , ac-
cording to Scanlon. [ill

hearing consistent informat ion 
about how much money would

caused, in part , because Tom

the paperwork wasn't reviewed

Peer counselors help others 
combat subst'ance abuse 
By MICHELE BIDWELL 
Staff Writ~r 

"Al co h o l and drugs kic ked my as , 
t hat's th e bott om line," sa id Mark 
Mitchiner , one of two a lcohol a nd sub-
sta nce a buse peer cou nselors at U CS D. 
As a recoveri ng drug add ict-a lco holi c, 
Mitchiner knows what it 's like to go 
"from havi ng everyth ing to li vi ng on the 
street" beca use of h is ad d ict io n. 

At i Sadichian!0uardlOn 

M itchiner has been sober since he was 
18 and can now look at his former situa-
tion object ively. "I had everything in the 
world , materially. I had the straight A's 
and a ll tha t," he said . Even after a nswer-
ing a que t io nnai re o n alcohol abuse in 
his fre hman } ea r, M itchiner still hadn't 
co mpre hend ed t he seriou ness of hi 
sit uat io n. 

"[The quest io nnaire] said that I was 
in the chro nic state of a lco holism and I 
said , 'Great. What do a lcoholics do? 
T hey d rink,' So, I co nt inued to use and 
a buse. I be lieved tha t I was an alco hol ic 
but I didn't accept it , a nd I didn't sur-
render," Mitch iner ex plai ned . 

"I had come to a poi nt where I knew 

" I knew that if I didn 't 
get sober, I was going to 
die. . I had to make 
a choice." 

-Mark Mitchiner 
tha t if I didn't get sober, I wa going to 
die ... I had to ma ke a choice." 

Ra nd i Coo per, another alcohol and 
substa nce a buse peer counselor, had to 
come to the sa me decisio n. Cooper is 
a lso a recovering alcoholic, a nd she too 
has had mo re tha n her sha re of unha ppy

"I maintained the straight A's , and I 
maintained doing all these wonderful 
things . . . and I still looked good, and I 
still had the nice clothes and the nice this 
a nd the nice that . . . but because I wasn't 

~illing to objectively look at [the situa-
tIOn] and sa y, 'Hey, this really is causing 

~e some dis turbances in my life,' I con-
tinued on . When the party was over, I 
kept going," Cooper explained. 

After the death of her husband in an 
alcohol-related accident, Cooper finally 
co nfront ed her addiction . "I not only 
had to accept that I was an alcoholic 
and wa nted to do something about it , I 
j ust had to accept that I wanted to live. 
Once I made that decision, I knew the 
only way I was going to live was if I did 
so sober because there was no way in 
hell that I could have kept living the way 
that I was . .. and that's real scary," 
Cooper said . 

With the urn of their individual 
experiences , both Mitchiner and Cooper 
have the in ight and understanding 
nece ary to be effective peer counse-
lors. Debbie Allen, an intern working to 
complete her doctorate in psychology 
by supervising and working with Mit-
chiner and Cooper, explained, "We 
prefer to have people who are recover-
ing from alcohol and substance abuse 
programs as our peer counselors because 
I think they are most effect ive . . . these 
people have the skills [and] they have 
heard it all. " 

According to these peer counselors, 
one of the main problems with alcohol 
and substance abuse among students is 
that the people who are abusers have a 
hard time recognizing their problem. 

Ali Sad1lhian/ Guardian

"We explore what's 
going on in that person 's 
life and try to understand 
what role drugs and alco-
hol play. " 

-Debbie Allen 
Cooper explained that with "people 

our age, it's very difficult to realize that 
'Yes, I've got a problem.' " Instead , 
they think, " 'I'm only 20 year old ... 
I'm still 'having all this fun . 'I can't have 
a problem.' ., "You look like everyone 
else in your group," Allen added . 

According to Allen, denial is a main 
characteristic of alcohol and substance 
abuse . "There's a lot of denial , and 
there's a lot of fear, and there's a lot of 
ignorance," Cooper agreed . 

Mitchiner said that on account of this 
attitude among students, "drug addicts 
don'tju t stop by to chat." That is why 
this peer counseling group encourages 
outside intervention. The counselors 
will help a friend or relative talk to 
someone who might be abu ing a sub-
stance by approaching that person with 
evidence of his / her abuse. This method 
may encourage that person to take a 
good look at his / herself and possibly 
take steps to recover. But what about 

"Admitting that you're 
an alcoholic is not admit-
ting that you are a terrible 
person. It's admitting you 
have a disease." 

-Randi Cooper 
the popular opInions that alcoholics 
and substance abusers have to want 
help before they can be helped?

"There's a myth around that," 
said Allen . "The research shows 
that most people don't want to 
go into treatment but [if] they're 
intervened upon and forced into 
treatment, they have just about 
a s high a success rate as people 
who admit themselves voluntar-
ily," she said . 

"A lot of times, it take inter-
vention - someone else just to 
get you to start talking a bout it ," 
Cooper said . "But," she con-
tinued , "at some point , if you're 
going to recover, and you're get 
to get sober, and you're going to 
stay sober, it's going to have to 
bejust for you because you want 
it . " 

Allen described their roles as 
peer counselors, " Weare primar-
ily involved in outreach to the 
tudents. We give information, 

education and try to make our-
selves more visible on campus."

Intro. to The Short Story 

When Carla told me that my date 
was a little short, r thought she was 
talking dollars and cents, not feet and 
inches. So there I was at the door, in 
my spiked heels, staring at the top of 
my date's head. 

All I could think was, how do I 
get myself out of this? I could imagine 
how my legs would ache ifI had to walk 
around with my knees bent all evening. 

So to stall for time, while figuring 
out how to fake malaria, I made us 
some Double Dutch Chocolate. 

When I brought it into the living 
room, I discovered that Gary was 
a chocolate lover too. Ahh, a man 
after my own heart. Okay, I de-
cided Itl give him a chance. So we 

sat down and saw each other face-
to-face for the first time. He had a 
nice smile. 

After some small talk-I mean 
conversation-I discovered that we 
both love Updike, hate the winter 
weather, and both have minia-
ture schnauzers. So, we made 
a date to introduce Shadow 
and Schatzi next week.

Wicker 
Continued from pige I 
won a clear victory, and by huge 
margins in the years 1972, 1980, 
and 1984. He supplied a detailed 
collection of numbers from the 
elections of the last 28 years. 

He gave as a reason for the 
Republicans' victories the 
statement that they were able to 
"exploit the weaknesses of the 
opposite party." 

Wicker claimed that the 
Democratic party had become a 
party of access because it is the 
voice of previously overlooked 
sections of the country, such as 
minorities and ethnic groups. 

However, "This makes it hard 
for the party to maintain unity 
once they are in office because 
t he different factions within the 
party are too ideological and 
unwilling to compromise," 
Wicker said . 

"American politics," he added, 
"is not about ideology. Ameri-
can politics is about winning. 
American politics is about vic-
tory. The candidate that can 
bring the most power to his party 
is the one that is going to get 
nominated. ~ 

And television has done a lot 
to make this the case, he added. 

"Television has become the 
national nervous system. [It] is 
perfect for candidates who need 
the mass support of the party." 

You've Utought about it. 

You've bied to imagine 
what it would be like. 

You know it would be 
exciting. And a 
challenge. And quite 
possibly the most 
rewarding experience of 
your life ••. 

Three Americans overseas in Asia, Africa 
and South America speak frankly on what 
Peace Corps life is like for them. 

It isn't easy and it isn't for 
everyone-they'll tell you that up front. 

But if you've ever considered going 
overseas in the Peace Corps, then now is 
your chance to see and hear for yourself 
what could be "the toughest job you'll 
ever love."

During the question and answer 
session which followed Tuesday 
night' lecture , one man asked if 
it is because of TV that discus-
sion of substance has been ig-
nored. "Well, discussion of sub-
stance has never been a promi-
nent issue in presidential cam-
paigns," Wicker replied with a 
chuckle. 

Wicker's wry sense of humor 
was very much in evidence dur-
ing Thursday night's lecture as 
well. This speech focused mainly 
on the Democratic party, but 
also included a few comments on 
the effect of media in presiden-
tial campaigns. 

He again blamed part of the 
extensive use of TV on the inde-

See WICKER, pice II 

Wicker 
Continued from page 10 
pendent campaign managers, 
people hedubbed "spin doctors," 
and stated that these"hired guns" 
were at least partially responsible 
for driving campaign costs up so 
high . He also said that the media 
manipulates American politics 
and creates an image of the can-
didate which may not necessarily 
be true . 

"A nd then, or course, the 
image goes away and we're stuck 
with the candidate behind it," he 
said. 

Wicker said that because of 
the amount of media attention 
that is focused on the primaries, 
print as well as TV, there is little 
emphasis on a candidate's expe-
rience, expertise in government, 
and loyalties, but instead on 
which candidate makes the best 
show. 

He continued that it is this 
candidate who is percei, ed as 
"winning" the primary. Conse-
quently, he is the one that gets 
the most media attention and is 
called the front-runner, not the 
one that really won the primary. 

"This can serve to rescue a 
candidate from oblivion like it 
did in 1984 for Gary Hart ," 
Wicker said. 

Wicker outlined three ways in 
which the RepUblican winning 
streak could be broken and the 
Democrats could win the 1988 
presidential election. 

"The first way would be by 
discrediting the Carter pre-
cedent," Wicker said. This, he 
explained, is the tendency to 
count on winning the early 
primaries and nomination on 
momentum, as Carter did as a 
relative unknown in 1976. 
Instead, the Democrats would 
have to workjust as hard at ~in­
ning the later primaries as well . 

The second way would be if 
another entrant, or draft choice, 
showed up in the later primaries, 
or even the convention, and 45 
percent of the delegate's votes 
had not yet been chosen. 

"That seems to be the magic 
number, 1 don't know why ." 
Wicker said even without dele-
gates, if the candidate was the 
peoples' choice, he would be a 
player in the game. 

"A third possibility, but 1 don't

No.18 Tritons upset No.9 CSU Northridge 
Tritons beat Matadors in five 
sets to improve record to 4-7 

By PHIL GRUEN 
Staff Writu 

Usually when there i a dis-
tinct ad\antage w one side of a 
court over the other, a team or 
player would naturally want to 
choose that side. Along these 
line. there i no doubt that the 
UC D mer,'s vo lleyball team 
knew about an apparent advan-
tage connected with the west side 
of the court aturday night in 
the Triton Pavilion. for they won 
all three of their games on that 
side and proceeded to upset the 
nationally ninth-ranked Cal 
State orthridge Matadors in 
five : 16-14, 11-15, 15- . 2-15.15-
6. (The Matador won their only 
two games also on the west end 
of the Pavilion .) 

wanted it more - we had that 
burning fire needed to win the 
game." Throughout much of the 
conte t, however. it seemed that 
the outcome cou ld have gone 
either way. 

The first game was an indica-
tion of things to come in a number 
of ways. Fi rst of all, excessive 
team spirit was displayed by bo th 
team which , for the most part, 
continu ed throughout the re-
mainder of the contest. In addi-
tion , it was the defensive tactics-
the blocked shots in particular-
that proved to be the difference 
in game one as well as in many of 
the other game . Finally, the 
winner of game one (UCS D) 
held down the west side, which 
was to be the si te of t he victor-
ious team in all of the other 
games. The triumph improves the 

Tritons'record to a not-so-flashy 
4-7 , but nevertheles give them 
a needed boo t of confide nce 
and will most likely improve 
upon their national ranking of 
18. 

In any case, it was CSD that 
jumped oUI to the initiaI4-llead , 
and although CS U orthridge 
got within one point at 13- l2late 
in the game, the po werful slams 
of John Lim, Miller, and Green 
and a great block by Gentz-
bourger won the game for the 
Tritons . 

Marco Gentzbourger ( N o . 8) and Paul M iller (No . 12 ) played po wer fully o n 
both offense and defense against CSU N orthridge 

Digger Graybill's youngsquad 
was everly over ized in this con-
test. The Ma tadors boa ted five 
players who were 6'5" a nd taller , 
while UCSD does not have a 
single member of that height. 
Oversized, maybe. Overmatched, 
a different story. Sterling per-
formances from setter Marco 
Gent zbourger, Paul Miller, Scott 
Green, and ick Rothman al-
lowed these smaller Tritons to 
perform "largerthan life" in what 
was probably their biggest vic-
tory so far this year. 

"It was a very exciting and 
intense game ," head coa ch 
Graybill mentioned after the con-
test. " It just seemed that we 

CS U orthridge displayed 
their power in game two, jump-
ing out to a 6-0 lead and ne er 
allowing UCSD to cli mb closer 
than within three points of their 
lead . Jeff Campbell and Rafael 
T ulino accounted for most of the 
Matadors' coring in this game, 
which wa s not as close as it seems 
with a final score of 15-11. 

Game three was prell y much 
the reverse of game two; here 
UCS D jumped out to the ear ly 
lead and behind Rothman , who 
practically carried the entire team 
with his killer jump-serves a nd 

his devastating slams, led the 
entire way en route to a 15-8 
victory. 

Game four, in con trast to the 
previous two games which were 
not a clo e as they seemed, was 
a lot closer than indicated by the 
15-2 count rung up by the Mata-
dors . Despite the fact that CS U 

'Northridge did deserve to win 
this game. thev were the bene-
factors of a number of unfortun-
ate calls by the referees and a 
great deal of uncharacteristic 
Triton mistakes . What this game 
did do, however , was set up a 
fifth and final game between 
these two talent-laden ballclubs. 

"I wouldn't have called this 
game tense ," Graybill stated . 
"Intense and exciting, maybe,

but not tense." 
All the intensit y and exci te-

ment boiled down to game five, 
and UCSD got the better of it as 
they broke the pattern of ex-
changing points and emerged 
from a 5-5 deadlock to pull away 
with a 15-6 victory. As was char-
acteristic of the evening, the 
clocked shots proved to be the 
crucia l factor in propelling the 
Tritons to victory . The last point 
was scored when Matador Tony 
Rusen, the sparkplug of their 
team (he cha lked upagame high 
53 assists) cou ld not catch up to a 
dig by one of his teammates that 
went off to the left. The ball 
bounced towards the scorer's 
table and UCSD's bench eru pted, 
victorious 3-2 in the over two-
hour thriller. 

" We're going to consider this 
game a begi nning for us - we're 
going to use it as a springboard 
for the remainder of the season," 
a pleased Graybill said in a post-
game interview. Before the game 
Graybill mentioned that UCSD 
plays "in the hotbed of collegia te 
volleyba ll ," ha ving had to face a 
number of the extremely tough 
west coast teams in the early 
going . "Our record may not be 
impressive looking, but it is con-
sidering the competition we 
faced . In our new conference 
(the Southern California Volley-
ball Conference with UC Irvine, 
Laverne, and Chapman), we have 
a ve ry good chance to be confer-
ence champions ." [Q)

Pandering to the bears 
By KATHLEEN DONAHUE 
A ssislant photo editor 

This is it! Yes . th is is yo ur last 
chance to see Basi and Yaun 
Yaun , th e two giant pandas visi t-
ing the Sa n Diego Zoo. The 
pandas are wrapping up their 
200-day stay on Feb. 9 and head -
ing back to China on Feb. 10. 
The San Diego Zoo was actually 
quite fortunate to have such dis-
tinguished visitors beca use there 

Basi (above) indulges in the 
pandas' favorite pastime - eat -
Ing bamboo - an activity which 
can last up to 16 hours a day. 
Yaun Yaun (right) displays his 
powerful chops. 

arc only abo ut 700 pandas left in 
the wild today, with onl y a few 
hundred in 700S throughou t the 
world . 

Pandas spend about 99% of 
their time eat ing a nd sleepi ng. 
T hey ca n spend upto 16hours a 
day ea ting their fa vorite foo t -
bamboo . The morning and ea rly 
evening are their preferred hours 
for exercising a nd eating - the 
former being much less frequent 
than the latter. 

The panda is thought to be 
patterned black and white for a 
couple of rea so ns. One is that 
other animals see the black and 
white coloring as a warning, te ll-
ing them that there is danger. 
The other reason is that it is eas-
ier for the pandas to ee one 
another in the thick bamboo 
forests , where they get most of 
their food . Another feature that 
enable the panda to survive is a 

, " I j 

fur coa t which can be up to two 
inches t hick. Pandas also have 
a n ex tra long wri st that ca n f unc-
tion like the human thumb does. 
a nd jaws that c rush the bamboo 
they eat. For a huma n to even 
cut a stalk of bamboo he would 
need to use an ax . 

Since the arrival of Basi and 
Yaun Yaun in late July , almost 
two million people have visited 
the zoo, increasing zoo attend-
ance by over 30 percent. The San 
Diego Zoo is one of the few 
organizations that are helping to 
save t he pandas. With each zoo 
ticket purchased. a certain per-
ce nt goes to prese rve the endan-
gered animal. The Chi nese govern-
ment ha s created II prese rves 
where pandas a re known to hab-
itate. So if you would like to hel p 
prese rve the panda, get to the 
San Diego Zoo before Feb. 10 
when they head back to Chi na .

see it. is if one of the seven 
dwarves turns out to be Franklin 
Roosevelt in disguise." Wicke r 
smiled . 

In answerto a si milar ques tion 
on Tuesday evening. Wicker also 
mentioned the possibilities of a 
Republican default as a result of 
the Iran-contra affair. and the 
chance of the economy getting so 
bad that the Republican party 
would fall out of favor. 

Wicker's response to a ques-
tion about his own opinion on 
who would win the presidential 
election was, "I really don't 
know, and I think it would be 
dangerous to speculate about it." 
On Thursday evening, however , 
to a question regarding who or 
what qualities would make up an 
ideal president Wicker answered : 
"Well, we'd have to resurrect 
him." He then went on to say 
that in his opinion, both Roose-
velt and Lincoln had been " mas-
ter politicians." 

"The presidency is a political 
office and I think a political per-
son works best in it. A president 
needs immense political sk ills." 

He commented that so far, 
only Albert Gore had displayed 
such skills, "although I'm more 
familiar with his father, the elder 
Gore," he admitted. 

Gore , a southern Democrat 
from Tennessee, has been cam-
paigning heavily in the southern 
states and virtually ignoring the 
Iowa and New Hampshire prim-
aries where candidates Gephardt,

in their second year of operation, 
are funded by Psychological and 
Counseling Services which are in 
turn funded by registration fees. 
Dr. Sara Arroyo , who has a 
Ph.D. in clinical psychology, is 
the administrative head of this 
particular peer counseling pro-
gram. Her role is to train, super-
vise, and interact with the peer 
counselors. 

The actual counseling respon-
sibility is left up to the student 
peer counselors. When someone 
comes to their office with a prob-
lem involving alcohol or sub-
stance abuse, the couselors stress 
that they "want to establish a 
relationship with that person so 
that they feel as if they have a 
friend, and we are that. We [each 
have] an open ear and are willing 
to spend time with them. We like 
to explore what's going on in 
that person's life and try to 
understa nd what role drugs play 
in their life , [and] we attempt at 
some point to diagnose whether 
there is an abusive situation , 
whether they're addicted or whe-
ther their use could just be in the 
realm of soc ial / recreational 
[use]," Allen said. She desc ribes 
this interaction as "a loving con-
frontation," and adds that the 
counselors are far from being 
judgmental. 

"Admitting that yo u're an 
alco holic is not admitting that 
you are a te rrible perso n. It·s 
admitting that you have a dis-
ease .. . and there is help avai la -
ble." Cooper said .

Earlie r in Thursday night 's 
lect ure. Wicker had also stated 
that Gore had made a "virtue of 
necessity" in withdrawing from 
the Iowa and New Hampshire 
primaries. 

"Not a good ri sk, those two 
states," Wicker said, Instead.
