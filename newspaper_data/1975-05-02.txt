Too Many Apartments 
About seven year ago, Del Mar wa a small 

undeveloped coast town . Then the developer 
moved In , as they did in many towns on the 
Ca lifornia coast, and in five years built Del Mar into 
a town oi 4800, With an overabundance ot apart-
ment building 

Controllll1g housmg growth became a political 
ISSU , as ugly apartments marred th cenery. In 
1972 hepard , Tom Pearson and Richard Rypll1 kl 
were elE!cted to the CounCil , Shepard and Pearson 
on ~Iow growth platiorm s With IllU h tudent 
ba kmg .

The Planning Department turned the General 

Plan over to the Planning Comml sion In January 
1975, which removed the den ity bonus , and pas d 
the Plan on to the D I Mar City Council in May of 
1975. 

The Coun "ha held three publl meeting II1ce

date targeted by the Council for the completed Plan 
is May 12.

POLITICS: JAMES G. SOlO 

Provincialism 
The last person from San Diego who held a sta te office was Bert 

Betts, State Treasurer during the administrations of Edmund G. Brown 
Sr. from 1959 to 1967. 

Betts moved away from San Diego and now makes his home in the 
Sacramento area, where he failed in a bid for State Controller i n last 
year's Democratic primary. 

San .Dlego is the second or third largest city in the state, depe[lding 
on whICh census you prefer. Yet the metropolitan region has not filled 
a si ngle one of the nine statewide offices for over eight years. This 
political reality reinforces two bad politi ca l reputations the city has 
lived under throughout recent history. 

Two Reputations 
The first reputation is that San Diego is largely considered to be 

either a quiet and conservative, or reac tionary town . This view is 
especially prevelent among the transient visitor or new residents 
ignorant of the political facts, often submerged by a negligent pres~ 
and the preconceived notions of a blind public. 

While it is true that San Diego has in the past tended to vote for 
conservat ives and Republicans in statewide elections, there are some 
other factors that should be considered : the county's voter registration 
has a more than 40,000 Democratic plurality ; four out of five 
assemblymen are Democrats, and the State Senate President Pro-Tem , 
Jim Mills, is ~ De~ocrat . In addition , the ci ty of San Diego is strongly 
Democra ti c III registration and voter preference. Currently in the City 
Council, there is a 7-2 or 6-3 liberal split. Finally , in the Democratic 
primaries, e pecia lly in statewide races, San Diegans tend to vote for 
strongly liberal candidates. In 1972, George M cGovern easi ly carried 
San Diego county while only narrowly carrying the state. 

The second reputation our area has had to live down is t he belief 
that an Diego is a bush league town of little or no importance . 

Bigness With Greatness 
Our university community, for example, is filled with people who 

have omehow come to equate bigness with greatness. This idea is 
espec ially prevalent among those at UC San Diego who come from the 
Los Angeles metropolis . Though one must admit Los Angeles, with its 
38% of the total state regi stration , appears monolithi c and immovable, 
other areas of the state are more important than their size alone might 
Imply. Orange County consistently provides huge Republican 
maJoflties that are in turn negated by the huge DemocratIC majorities 
of Alamed a and San Francisco counties . 

an Diego, on the other hand, is such a diverse area that no one 
group can truly dominate election results . San Diego Coynty is proof 
perfect in a state where diversity is the political rule. Of all the urban 
cou nties, San Diego still retains agriculture as one of her major in-
du tfles . As such, the agricultural vote is still Important, e pec lally in 
the northern and the eastern districts of the county San Diego also has 
small but vibrant ethnic communities, whose importance lie, not in 
providing a monolithic bloc of voters, but rather in adding to the 
cu ltural flavor and complexity of political issues In southeast San 
Diego, thE're are prominent black and chicano communities. In Point 
Loma there is a large Portuguese fishing community With Its own 
special problems, and in Oceanside, there is the largest Samoan 
community in the nation . Each of these communit ies and others like 
them contribute in their own way to the San Diego political scene . 

San Diegans are more li'<ely to be independent in their thinking. In 
the last election , when t~e entire nation was caught up in the 
Watergate Reaction , San [';ego seemed barely touched by it. Instead, 
local issue were more important to the voters. National politicos 
brought in during the Wilson-O'Connor congressional race, were 
politely yawned at. 

Cannot Hope to Win 
Ye~ San Diego, this microcosm of the California political structure, 
Wlt~ Its paradoxes and independent thinking, is not neglecte::l during 
national and state races . To win in California, one has to do well in San 
Diego . A Democrat cannot hope to win if he cannot at least take the 
ci ty, in order to offset the usually huge Republican majorities in the 
North Cou nty communities. While immigrants scoff at the importance 
of San Diego, experienced politiCians like Jerry Brown, John Tunney, 
and Alan Cranston spend a lotof time in the area during a campaign .

Concert Scene 
Box Office Battles 
As Concerts Clash 

by Larry Deckel 
Art. Editor . 

Hurry, hurry, ladies and gentlemen, the greatest battle of the century 
I L:nderway. I n this corner, weighing in at many thousand dollars I 
onE' concert act, and in that corner, weighing In at just as many 
thousand dol lars, is yet another. 

The concert scene In San Diego has run into this trouble before, and 
this week is a prime example of it, for somehow or another concert 
promoters seems to set two shows for the ame night, and both get 
knocked about in the battle for your ticket dollars 

Anyway, I'm goi ng to keep my face clean this ~eek and specify no 
preferences, but let you decide who's going to Win each bout 10 thiS 
week 's concert actIOn ' 

On Saturday, it's the 'Doobie Brothers at the Sports Arena versus Bil! 
Cosby at the Civic Theatre. Cosby has a strong followi ~g in the over-~O 
group but might suffer from the overlapping appeal With some Do?ble 
fans The Doobie show is tak ing no chances and IS bringing 10 a 
lightweight openi ng act,Henry Cros~, to set things off . 

The Sa n Diego performing arts center serves as the battleground for 
Thursday's bout. Appearing in Golden Hall is Jackson Browne and 
Phoebe Snow, a pair of fine vocalists who promise an intimat,e 
gri pp ing show. Next door, however, only severa l hundred feet away I.t s 
jim Dandy to the rescue as BI .. ck Oak Arkansas get hot and nasty With 
opening act Montrose. 

Tuesday the Sports Arena has got a simple knock down . Either you 
have a ticket to see John Denver and you'll see him, or you don't, can't 
get one (i.e. it's sold out) and you don't see him. Country roads leading 
to the ports arena? No comment. . . 

Wrap up of this weeks concert battle is probably an unfair fight. 
Basically it's a financial battle Wednesday gives you the optio~ to 
catch two hot jazz acts, Weather Report and Billy Cobbham,at the CiVIC 
Thea tre (believe me, it'> really a pleasure to see the Civic Theatre being 
used so much recently for concerts, it is such an improvement over the 
Sports Arena ... . ), or to stay here at home and catch a free show in the 
Revelle Side Door: BrotherS of the Universe, who made their UC San 
Diego debu t duri ng Black Consciousness Week with thei r own brand of 
rhythmic and percussive jazz. 

All in all this week's concert scene runs the full gamu t, from pop to 
country to 'rock to jazz to downright raunch . It's just a shame so many 
of the shows have to appear on the same night. Any bets as to who'll 
uffer at the box office?

Maynard Brings Down the Walls 
You've no doubt all seen Ella Fitzgerald doin~ 

that cassette-tape commercia l where she breaks the 
glass by singing a high note . Well , multiply that 
fourteen-fold, add a dozen or so microphones, and 
.,it back to watch the plaster flake off the wall This 
gives you an idea of what was generated by 
Maynard Ferguson Monday at the Mandeville Center 

From the audience reaction , which included four 
standing ovations , the Big Band scene seems as 
vital a ever. 

What interests me is the reason for the audience 
attra ction to Big Bands such as Buddy Rich's, 
Woody HE'rman 's, Stan Kenton's and Ferguson's. 
And why IS a featured soloi st like a Ferguson or a 
herman so popular and eventually abused? 

The Big Bands have never really left us since the 
popularIZing of them in the 1930's by Duke 
Ellington . They were overshadowed during the 
1960's by the rise of rock 'n ' roll but the likes of 
Kenton , Rich and others remained . 

Strangely enough , the audience tndt Big Band 
seem to attract are the young kids . They are at the 
age when they have an excess of energy and are 
earching for an outlet. jazz, as a direct expression 

of emotional improvisation , appeals as an outlet for 
this overflow of energy . 

There is also an interesting phenomenon that 
enthusiasm grows in direct proportion to the 
volume of music. Notice that when a piercing 
ound of a cymbal rings through the audience, the 

exci tement builds . 
This was obvious Monday night as Maynard 

Ii umpet . accompan ied by the oooing and ahing oi 
all arou"ed audience . 

Maynard IS a complete musiCian , able to play any 
of the In truments in the band . just recently he won 
the Playboy jazz Poll as a trombone player (which 
shows you the validity of this poll ) Maynard plays a 
trumpet of hiS own devising, M .F Horn, and also 
has designed a 'Superbone ', a combination of valve 
trombone and slide 

Maynard has put together a group of very 
tal ented musiC ian s. Many previously played With 
Stan Kenton', Buddy Rich and Woody Herman For 
example, Andy M c intosh, the alto sax player , has 
mastered the art of "circu lar breathing ," the 
constant intake of air Circulating through your 
diaphragm and cheeks (two pressure points) that 
enables you to conti nue breathing without stopping 
to inhale and exhale . ThiS IS U ed w hen a burst of 
mspiratlon occurs'durlng a 010 and you don 't wan t 
to break the momentum . 

Not everyth ing In the group works, however. ~or 
one, Maynard \ emphaSI S on the brd~' cOnlpletely 
overshadowed the three saxes , which could only be 
heard on solo The cool , relaxing, easy flow that 
saxe can provide was desperately mls ed . Even 
their solos were in heated battle With the brass . ThE' 
epi tome of thE' Big Band ~ound with a featured 
soloist tor me i the Duke Ellington prinCiple 
utilized In " oncerto for Cootie .. 

In thl In ·tance Cootie Williams was the featured 
trumpetsoloi st He set a particular mood and feel in 
thiS composition while the band introduced him , 

pierced through the audience with hi s screaming Continued on Page 5

St J1ents Powerful Minority 

Shepard is "r~ally concerned" that the General 
Plan, if approved in its current form, will so 
aggravate the problem of low cost housing that 
within five years there will be none left in Del Mar, 
thus excluding lower income people, including 
students, from living there. 

Shepard doesn't consider the exclusion of low 
cost housing provisions to be a conscious decision 
by the task forces, but that it just wasn't a high 
priority. 

From discussions with other Counci l members, 

Triton Times 

Shepard thinks he has two votes. out of the five 
Council positions. for the density bonus, his own 
and Nancy Hoover's . Hoover. along with John 
Weare. was elected in 1974 with heavy student 
support. on platforms of controlled growth , 

In order to gain the extra vote he needs, Shepard 
feels the students must pressure one of the other 
two council members they helped elect. Students 
are a very powerful minority in Del Mar, Shepard 
asserted, as they constitute 500 out of the 2300 
registered voters there. 

This is a "critical time" in Del Mar's history, 
Shepard said; the decision made May 5 will decide 
whether Del Mar becomes a viab le, diverse 
community or a "middle class white ghetto."

One reason for the limited

that II takes anywher between 
300 and 400 new students at-
tending UCSD each year before 
.. tudent affairS can operate at the 
same level as In the prevIous year. 
and that any new programs 
Initiated would have to be funded 
from the available base 

When the budget IS finalized

Murphy commE'n ted that the 
probable amount of funds 
available to the Intercollegiate
