will sound at 7: 15 a.m. 
on October 16 
By Erika Snider

Instead of waking ur to the

sound all across campus alerting 
students to a mandatory emergency, 

evacuation drill. 
During the drill , which i~ 

expected to last approx imately 30 
minutes , students will evacuate 
their buildings as they would in a 
rea l emergency.

UCSD Comes Together to Participate In AIDS Walk '97 
CAUSE: Students, 
faculty and staff join 
first campus team 
By Ryan Ol.on 
Co-News Editor 

Thousands of people from all 
walks of life gathered at San 
Diego's Balboa Park downtown 
yesterday morning to promote 
HIV I AIDS awareness. 

The eighth annual AIDS Walk 
San Diego - with the theme 

"Keep walking, we' re not there 
yet" - drew more than 10,000 
people downtown to raise funds for 
local AIDS service organilations. 

This year is the first that UCSD 
has a campuswide tecvn. Co-cap· 
tains Rich Belmontel and Sarah 
Archibald put together the team of 
150 students, staff and faculty 
members to raise more than $2,500. 

Belmontez - an assistant safety 
officer at the Medical Center -
said that the team's name - "All 
@ UCSO" ..:.... ref~rs '0 the campus-

wide electronic mailing list. This 
name il> meant to conjure up the all 
inclusiveness of the AIDS walk . 

Belmontez aid that it was 
important that the UCSD commu-
nity focus on such a vital issue. 

" It 's as much a community 
event as it i~ a fund-raiser," 
Belmontez said. "Everyone likes 
being a part of something bigger. 
The pride in UCSD. Being a part 
of the community. It's an eltciting 
event because it's like a parade that 
you can pll1ic:ipale in." 

La!>t year. Beimontci formed a 
50-member Medical Center team. 
That team rai~ed about $1,500. 
Figures for thi!> year were not read-
i Iy available. 

Last year 's AIDS Walk raised 
money for more than 30 HIV/AIDS 
service agencies from diverse area!> 
of San Diego County. 

Over 300 teams from around the 
community - including the team 
from UCSD - and hundreds of 
individual walkers gathered at 9

Middle-School Students See 
Earth From Space Via UCSD 
EDUCAnON: KidSat 
successfuJly ends 
three-year mission 
By Sarah Snyder 
Guardian Reporter 

Although Friday marked the 
linal mission of NASA's three-year 
pilot Kid 's Satellite (KidSat) pro-
gram, the future of space education 
looks starry hecausc the program 
has been granted funding for three 
more years. 

The KidSat program represenl -
ed a pannership between UCSD, 
the Johns Hopkins Universily 
Institute for the Academic 
Advancement of Youth . and 
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
(JPL). This collaboration will con-
tinue for the new incarnation of 
KidSat, called Earth Knowledge 
Acquired by Middle Sl:hools 
(EanhKAM). 

Fifty-two middle schools partic-
ipated in this third and linal mis-
sion of the KidSat program, live of 
Ihem from San Diego County. This 
represents a significant increase 
from Ihe 17 schools from the U.S., 
England and South Africa thaI par-
tit.:ipaled in the second KidSat 

night in January of 1997. 
Students at the middle S(;hools 

used Internet technology to operate 
a digital-still camera aboard the 
space shull Ie AtlantiJ on its recent 
mission to the Russian space sta-
tion Mir. The modified Kodak cam-
era was mounted in the overhead 
flight-deck window of the space 
shuttle. 

The program 's final elTon took 
place Friday morning at the 
Mission Operations Control 
(MOC), a control room modeled 
after NASA's Johnson Space 
Center. 

The MOC, run by a team of 
UCSD undergraduates, is located 
on the tir~t noor of the newly wm-
pleted Science and Engineering 
Research FaL:ility. 

Physics Professor Sally Ride. 
the lirst female U.S. astronaut , 
directs the KidSat program at 
UCSD. Ride, who played a key 
role in the development of the orig-
inal KidSal program, said neXI year 
there will be no major changes 
despite the name change. 

"Basically NASA has just 
renewed Ithe programl, and iI'S 
going to look very much the same 
in lenns of Ihe instrumenls and the 

control center," Ride said . "Our 
main goal is going to be to wnlin-
ue to expand Ihe numher of middle 
schools Ihal arc involved." 

Ride said KidSal requires a high 
level of com pUler technology to 
run . 

"1 KidSatl is a content based 
program Ihal you could not run 
without Ihc World Wide Weh - if 
the Web didn ' t e~ist. ncilher would 

thi~ program," ~he said 
In addilion, Ride said Ihal most 

students did nOl need 10 be taught 
how to use computers. Instead. she 
said, sometimes the teachers are the 
ones who require the most wmput-
er instruclion. 

According 10 NASA advisor 
John Baker. who worked with thc 
MOC on KidSat 's camera lechnol -
ogy, the wnfirmed ~ut.:t.:ess cou ld 
mark Ihe beginning of a new era in 
NASA'~ educalional prugram~ . 

'This is very innovative : it's 
INASA's] lirst night program," he 
said. "There has never been an edu-
cational flight program before. 
nothing that was integrated." 

The At/WI/is aslronauls sel up 
the KidSat camera at the heginning 
of Iheir mission and took il down

Movie Violence Feeds 
Our Warped Primal Need 
America's obsession with violence only hides its 
lack 0/ intellectual thought, low self-esteem and 
an inabili~y to learn from past mistakes 
By Jessyca Wallace 
Associale Opinion Edilor 

There exisls a deplorahle glohal 
Irend in various cultures, panil:u-
larly Ihe United Slales of America. 
Extremely graphic, gory and stom-
ach-turning violence is considered 
hrilliant enlertainment. 

The ecumenical agreemenl 10 
walch and enjoy horrendous 
physical harm inflicled upon 
other people is not to be con-
demned, for il is pan of human 
nalure. I would like 10 helieve, 
however. Ihat in lOday's Agc of

Jonah Freedman 
Co-Managing Editor 
Taking Time To 
Smell The Roses 

While what I am going t(, cover 
in the immediate future in my soap-
box may n01 apply 10 every UCS D 
siudent. it i~ ~omething that evc r) · 
one 'enrolled here will face ~ooner 
or lat er. J am talking about becom-
mg a enior. 
. F(lr some. the menlion of the 

word "~enl or" bri ngs a Sigh of 
relic I'. After four, five or - as John 
Blutar~ky from "Animal House" 
might have said - eight year~ of 
college, many students lind il hard 
10 believe that their long senlence 
here at UCSD has actually t.:ome to 
an end: no more studying, pro-
grams. homework . papers. projecls 
and so on - al least not in the 
scholaslic sense. And the word 
"senior" is closely followed by the 
word "graduation." 

Being a senior is a very exciling 
time. Countless years of school are 
t.:oming 10 an end. wilh graduale 
school possibly looming in Ihe 
horizon. IT is also a bil stary -
moving on always is . Afler spend-
ing three years at UCSD, the real-
ization lhal This is my lasl year here 
brings several mixed emotions. 

Of course I'am lhrilled. My last 
year before mOiling on - il is bolh 
exciling and exhilarating. It seems 
like ages ago lhal my parenls and I 
loaded up Ihe old Dodge Ram Van 
and headed south from L.A .• wilh 
Ihe realizalion thaI I was entering a 
new chapler of life. It also signified 
To me lhat my childhood was over. 
ilnd I had many new responsihililies 
- moslly Ihal I had 10 take care of 
myself wilh lillie out side help . 

I spent Ihe helter pan or lhree 
yeilrs making San Diego Illy home, 
hOlh by adjusting 10 life al UCSD 
and by lea rning Ihe in 's and out 's of 
a new city. It is strange to think 
bilck 10 Ihe days when I did not 
know where a certain building was. 
or remembering the anlicipation I 
e)(perienced my freshman year 
while eagerly awaiTing the grand 
opening of RIMAe. or even return-
ing back to UCSD for my sopho-
more yCOIr. feeling a lillIe older and 
a lillie wiser - and rcalizlIlg how 
far a schlep il was up and down Ihe 
newly·unveiled Lihmy Walk. 

I am very proud to be a senior. 
do not gel me wrong. but entering 
my laST year of tollege. and realiz-
ing lhallhis is it , I tan not help bul 
he a lillie nervous aooul my fUlure. 
Gradualing 10 June will be a sweel 
feeling. bul I will nevcr have sume 0" the ~m:al expcrien~cs I have had 
in tollege ever again.

were talking to each olher, bul nol all

I J 

UCSD has the facilities 10 
prepare you for the real 
world, but it doesn't actively 
do it . You definitely have to 
go out and seek those facili -
lies. You have to take a very 
active part in going out and 
preparing yourself for the 
real world. But those oppor-
tunities are definitely here. 

D.vIdC .... 
Roosevelt Senior 

[As far as) the schooling. I 
think UCSD prepares people 
for the real world, However. 
when it comes to social 
events and stuff and interac-
tion with people, I think 
UCSD falls a lillie shon. In 
the. real world interactions 
amongst people [are) really 
important.

Two Game. on the Road, Two Victories 
As The Tritons aegin To Gain Momentum 
THREE IN A ROW: The University of Redlands and Pomona-Pitzer 
College couldn't muster enough energy to contain the Tritons attack 
By Jonah NIHMon 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

senior goalie Pat Beemer said. "We 
came into the game with the alli-
tude we were just going to beat up 
on these guys. but we came out so 

While there were many baseball 
fans out Friday night drowning 
their sorrow~ over the Florida slow and we let them get into the 

."~~!!I game." Marlins' sweep of the San 
Francis(;(l Giants, the only 
West Coast team left in 
the playoffs, the UCSD 
men's water polo team did 
not have that luxury. 

Spending all week 

The Tritons . were sav-

Mecham said. "We went up 3-0 and 
then we kind of gave up. We lost 
our intensity:' 

Redlands did its best to stay in 
the game, and at the half had 
worked it s way into a tic , but the 
squad wa.~ outmanned and slower 
than its counterpart. Even with ils 
lac kadaisical play, UCSD emerged 
vic torious. 

Followi ng the Redlands game. 

r--------------------~ ing up their energy to go on the toad Saturday to 

working on ~ ix-on - fi ve 's in 
prac tice, UCSD hoped to 
improve on its lack luster 
ki ck-out opportunities of 
the past. Unfortunately, 
things did not go as expect-
ed. In facl, an 18 percent 
six -on-fi ve mark is nothing 

Head Coach Denny Harper sa id a 
few words to the team. One can 
onl y guess that he wasn' t asserting 
hi s pleasure about the narrow vic-
tory over a team that should have 
been destroyed. Perhaps he added 
on top of that a need for the Tritons 
to get thei r heads out of their, well, 
you know whats.

Two games, now that '~ no big 
deal, unless one is to be played at 
Redlands and the other at Pomona-
Pitzer, about two hours away. That 
means after a game against the 

Bulldog~ , they Jumped in the va n 
and headed <)ver to Pomona-Pit/er 
just in time 10 make the opening 
sprinl. 

De>pite the lenglhy time spent 
in the trave l va n., Ihe Tri lOm 
emerged victorious in both their 
games, upping their record to 5-8. 
The competition was not expected 
to be the stiffest, which left UCSD 
a good chance to pull off a rare pair 
of road wins. However. the 9-5 vic-
tory that Ihe Tnloo> left Redland. 
with was far from ~a ti ~ fac tory . 

"We came out so slugg ish," 

"Our six -on-live's were one of 
the most fruSirating things ye~ te r­
day," Beemer said. " IRedlands] 
wasn' t even playing well defen-
sively. We were try ing to rush the 
six-on-fi ve 's too much. All last 
week, we prac llced six-on-li ve\ 
for 40 minutes a day. I think we jusl 
gOI Ilustered and tri ed to rush it too 
much rather than hilling all the 
passing lanes first." 

Going into the game, the Tritons 
had a bl ow-the-opponent-away 
allitude, knowing they were a het-
tcr team. They only hoped that they 
could maintain a hi gh intensity 
level for both matches. UCSD fig-
ured to dispatch the Bulldogs hand-
ily and led early, hUI things didn ' t 
stay thai way. 

"We came out all ri ght." sopho-
more defensive spec iali , t Ro;s 

On their way to Pomona-Pitzer. 
the Tritons agai n prepared to do 
bailie. In the li r t half. UCSD 
appeared like the juggernaut it had 
hoped to be. Goalie Pat Beemer 
pitched Ihe shutout in the li r,t half. 
Defensively, UCSD was great in 
shulling down any offensive threat 
that Pomona-Pit 7er mounted. III 
addit ion to that, the team was coun-
tering hard and executing passes 
like ils had in prac ti ce during the 
week. 

"The fi rst half was exac tly what 
we wanted to do defensive ly," 
j unior Andy Sil vestri , aid . "We 
pressed the hell out of them, and

UCSD Masters The Master's In Friday-Night Victory 
IMPORTANT: In the midst of the toughest part of their schedule, the Tritons got a vital 4-2 Division III win over The 
Master's College on Friday night at RIMAC Field, a win that will definitely bolster the Tritons' hopes for the postseason 
By Travll Hili 
Sports EdItor 

When the !>\;hedulc for thc 19l)7 
CCS D Illcn's soccer team carne 
OUI. the Illo~t glaring , tretch of 
games wa~ from OCI. I 
thro ugh O CI. 5. In that 
Il vc-day peri od , the 
Tritons would have Ihree 
w ai ght ni ll cal Division 
III ga me, against ri vals 
Pomona-Piller College, 
The Ma~t cr 's College and 
Ca liforn ia Lutheran 
Uni versity. 

Th is would be the test to see 
how far Head Coach Derek 
Anmtrong's young squad ha 
come, and if the Triton, arc ready 
10 continue the tradition of soccer 
greatness at Ihis schoo l. 

Two down. one to go. and things 
are looking good . 

Last Wednesday. UCS D hauled 
wi th Pomuna-Pitler into sudden 
death overtime. and even though 
the Tritons clearly oUlplayed the 
Sagehens, they came away with a 
I-I ti c. 

Last Friday n ,~ the li ghts 
were on at RIMAC Field and hun-
dred. or . pectators turned oul for 
the bailie hctween UCSD and The 
Master's. The lie aga inst Pomona-
Pitzer increased the imponance or 
thb match and a win would be a 
se ri ous boost 10 either team's 
impending postseason run . 

The only problem was that 

. UCSD was not at full strength for 
the game - jUnior sweeper John 
Brandon. the anchor of the Triton 
defense. would not play becau,c or 
a deep contusion in hi S left thigh. 

By plugging in replace-
ment Jaime LUllon. 
Armstrong created an all -
freshman starting defense 
with Rohert Be~s ler and 
Ty ler Thompson. 

Their play would he 
critical to a Tri ton victory. 
and earl y on it looked 
bleak. In the eighth 

minute of the game, the defense 
broke down and the Muslangs cap-
it ali led with it nice through ball 
from midtie lder Paul Dojo to for-
ward Lucas Principe and took a 1-0 
lead. 

The MU!.t il ng, were plaYing 
very aggre,si ve soccer. tryi ng to 
take advantage of the inex peri -
enced Tri tons. LUllon, Bess ler and 
Thompson started to come togeth -
er. With a lot of help from mid-
I ielders Cameron Adams. Doug 
McBride, Alex Glebov and Shane 
Sledcr. the defense not only began 
to lighten up, it began (() tum the 
tide. 

Start ing from the had., UCS D 
began to generate more offe nse. 
Afler some seri ous pressure. the 
Tritons finally got on the board in 
the 33 rd minute. How fitting it was 
that a membcr of the defense, 
Thompson, was the one who 

.cored . 
Then both teams found out how 

qUi ckl y momentum can change. 
After Thompson's goa l. the 
Mustangs were on the ropes. They 
got out oJ' a couple of jams, and in 
the 44th IIllnutc. Dojo found a 
small opening and ex ploited it . 
pUlltng The Ma~te r '!, ahead :!- I. 

Now the j()you~ Mustang, had 
momentum on tlwir ~ Ide . They had 
fended off some close UCSD 
allempt, on goal and nllw seemcd 
poi sed to hold their lead. 

That 's how it seemed, not how it 
wa~ . 

Just under a minute later sopho-
more Brady Bernard broke through 
Ihe Mustang de fe n~e and ti ed thc 
game at 2-2. It wa~ a wild fi rst half. 
and the ,econd half looked wide 
open. 

It wa.n·1. UCSD tool-. control of 
the game early In the second half 
and took the lead li ve minutes into 
it on a great goal by junior fo rward 
Jacob Bollinger. He took a loose 
hall deep inside the 18-meter hox 
and converted on a beautiful ~hol. 
pUlling the Tritons ahead 3-2. 

That was all the Trrtons needed 
as the defense and goalkeeper 

Luca~ Curtolo cOnlinucd to rlay 
terrific ~occer. They ke pi the 
MUMang offen~e in check while the 
midfielders continued to build the 
allack. 

Finally, in the 75th minute, the 
Tritons slammed the door on The 

Claore Schnelder/ iSuardlan 
By You: Senior midfielder Doug McBride dribbles pas t an opposing 
defender in the Tritons 4-2 win over The Master's College. 

Master's hopes with a goa l from 
freshman midficlder Dana Cari~s . 

That put the Tri tons ahead 4-2 
and from there Armstrong's boy~ 
cruised to a big victory. 

Yesterday the men played their 
biggest game of the season -
against the Cal Lutheran 

Kingsmen. In Thousand Oa l-.s. 
Unfortunately at the time of 

print , the GLllIrtiill ll \ vaunted 
sport , staff exhausted all of it s con-
nections. but still could not obtain 
results from the game. It will be 
covered in detail in thi s Thursday 's 
edition.
