STUDENTS ON STRIKE

UCSD graduate Teaching Assistants, undergraduate students and other campus workers protested along Gilman Drive and throughout campus on 
Wednesday in solidarity with AFSCME patient care workers who were striking across all UC Medical Centers due to alleged unfair management practices.

Librarians
To Receive 
Salary 
Increases
The new five-year wage 
contract marks the first 
pay increases for UC 
librarians since 2010.

BY  Gabri ella Fleisch man
senior  staff  writer

UC  SYSTEM

University of California officials 
reached an agreement for a two-phase 
salary increase with the American 
Federation of Teachers on a new five-
year wage contract for UC librar-
ians last Friday. The primary wage 
increase from the old contract will be 
the first raise the librarians have seen 
since they last renewed their contracts 
with UC administrators in 2010.

The contract’s first phase is an 
average 2.7-percent salary increase 
as of Nov. 1 for all university librar-
ians. Associate and assistant librar-
ians receiving a positive performance 
review will be granted a 5.4-percent 
salary increase, and more senior 
librarians will receive an 8.1-per-
cent salary increase. Administrators 
say they hope the universities will 
have more flexibility in distributing 
librarians’ salaries, allowing for the 
recruitment and retaining of better 
librarians.

According to UCSD Associate 
University Librarian for Enterprise 
Services Tammy Dearie, the UC 
librarians, who ratified the contract 
in a mere two weeks, overwhelmingly 
supported the changes.

“The reason for the changes is 
that the librarians’ salaries, from the 
union’s and management’s perspec-
tive, were under market value,” Dearie 
said. “What it did was to bring their 
salaries closer into alignment with 
librarians’ salaries at other universi-
ties that we compare ourselves to, 
such as the CSU scale and other big, 
public universities across the United 
States. Our salaries were slightly lower 
than theirs, and now they’re compa-
rable.”

Librarians’ salaries, and thus 
this salary increase, will be funded 
through the same channels as those 
of faculty salaries, using student 
fees overseen by the Department of 
Academic Affairs.

“Librarians often get raises when 
faculty get raises but not always,” 
Dearie said. “They certainly have a 
different salary scale than faculty, but 
I think with this new salary scale, 
they are very well compensated for 
their work.”

The new contract additionally 
established a new arrangement for 
healthcare benefits — providing that 
librarians receive medical, dental and 
vision care at the same rate as the 
general UC employee population — 
as well as the elimination of a “barrier 
step.” With this removal, any librarian 
can more easily move up the salary 
scale without having to pass through 
a barrier, making it easier to have a 
merit increase and thus more difficult 
to be demoted.

PATIENT CARE WORKERS 
STRIKE ON CAMPUS

UC SYSTEM

The strikers protested alleged unfair labor management practices 
and illegal intimidation and harassment from UC administration.

BY  Justine Liang  Contributing  Writer

U niversity of California Workers of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 3299 protested 
on Wednesday, Nov. 20 across all nine UC campuses 
and UC medical centers, including UCSD’s Thornton 
Hospital and the Hillcrest UCSD Medical Center. 

The AFSCME strike includes UC Patient Care 
Technical Workers and Service Workers, along with 
solidarity-striking Graduate Teaching Assistants, UC 
students, elected officials and other UC workers. 

Picket lines ran from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. on 
Wednesday on all campuses. 

“Our members have both the legal right and 
moral responsibility to stand up for the safety of 
the students and patients we serve,” AFSCME 3299 
President Kathryn Lybarger said in a press release 
on Nov. 20. “By attempting to silence workers, UC 
hasn’t just repeatedly broken the law — it has willfully 

endangered all who come to UC to learn, to heal and 
to build a better life for their families.”

AFSCME represents almost 13,000 UC patient 
care workers and 8,300 service employees and is 
UC’s largest union. The strike aims to correct dis-
putes between the administration and workers 
due to alleged illegal intimidation and harassment. 
AFSCME has compiled evidence of illegal conduct, 
detailed in the complaint issued by the State’s Public 
Employment Relations Board in September 2013.

AFSCME Local 3299 has exempted some of 
its critical care workers from the strike, and Judge 
David I. Brown barred certain employees, including 
respiratory therapists and hemodialysis technicians 
from striking, as they perform essential functions in 
patient health and safety.

“By calling for a strike for a second time in seven 
months, AFSCME leaders again are putting patients

Former assemblyman and 
returning UCSD professor Nathan 
Fletcher announced yesterday that 
he will concede his position as can-
didate, stepping out of the running 
for San Diego Mayor to replace 
former mayor Bob Filner.

As of Tuesday’s special election 
— drawing a 30 percent voter turn-
out — Fletcher, a Democrat, received 
49,645 votes, while current second-
place candidate Councilman David 

Alvarez received 2,638 more votes 
for a total of 52,283 votes. Both 
candidates trailed behind first-place 
finisher and Republican candidate 
Councilman Kevin Faulconer, who 
received 89,043 votes. 

“I leave today with my head held 
high about the campaign we ran,” 
Fletcher said in an interview with 
U-T San Diego.

San Diego Registrar of Voters 
officials had yet to count 34,500 
absentee and provisional votes 
before Fletcher announced his con-
cession.

Fletcher spoke to Alvarez shortly 
after dropping out of the race, offer-
ing his full support and endorse-
ment to the second-place candidate, 
who will participate in a final run-
off election with Faulconer early 
in 2014.

Citing negative campaigning and 
messages broadcast by the labor and 
Republican parties as reasons for 
the lack of votes, Fletcher says he 
now hopes to help improve the city 
through avenues outside of public

Scientists at the Scripps Institution 
of Oceanography Marine Biology 
Research Division published find-
ings last week on the Chaetopterus, 
a marine worm that possesses bio-
luminescent qualities. The glowing 
properties of Chaetopterus — also 
known as a parchment worm — are 
direct results of the mucus that it 
secretes and may provide insight into 
developing biotechnological methods 
for producing light.  

For the last 50 years, scientists 
have overlooked the peculiar quali-
ties of the Chaetopterus. However, 
with their recent findings published 
in the journal, Physiological and 
Biochemical Zoology, they are aim-
ing to usher in more research oppor-
tunities for scientists who desire to 
understand the unique properties 
behind this marine worm.

“We have a diversity of people 
involved,” Scripps Associate Research 

Scientist Dimitri Deheyn said. “We 
are able to span the whole range of 
academic levels.”

Initial experiments began with the 
harvesting of marine worms from 
the La Jolla submarine canyon. From 
there, they were transported to a 
laboratory setting where scientists 
worked to identify the unique char-
acteristics of the marine worm. They 
discovered that the Chaetopterus 
produces a long glow of blue light in 
the absence of oxygen — a phenom-
enon that is rare in bioluminescent 
species, which are organisms that can 
naturally produce light. These worms 
differ from other underwater biolu-
minescent organisms that produce 
short flashes of light in the green 
spectrum that can often be seen in 
shallow coastal environments.

“The fact that the light is pro-
duced as a long glow without direct 
oxygen consumption is attractive for 
a range of future biotechnological 
applications,” Deheyn said in a press 
release conducted by the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography. “We are 

motivated to look to nature to find 
organisms that produce novel light.”

In another study, the team of 
researchers found that riboflavin, a 
common dietary supplement, is a 
main component in the mucus that 
is secreted. Scientists note that the 
worms do not produce riboflavin on 
their own; rather, the worm acquires 
vitamin B2 through their food source. 
They speculate that riboflavin and 
other related compounds serve as the 
emitter in the worm’s light producing 
reaction.

In the future, scientists plan to 
expand their research to further 
identify how these different com-

pounds work together make light. 
Researchers plan to test whether the 
compounds require a certain ratio, 
pH or ion to create visible blue light.

Deheyn hopes his research will 
provide opportunities for students 
to explore and be involved in the 
research of unknown marine species.

“The outcome of our research is 
attractive in a sense that not many 
people work with luminescent 
worms,” Deheyn said. “We are open-
ing the door to work with weird 
animals.”

office. 
“You can make a difference in a 

lot of ways,” Fletcher told U-T San 
Diego. 

Filner resigned from office 
in August, amidst sexual harass-

ment allegations, pleading guilty to 
counts of false imprisonment and 
misdemeanor. Following the resig-
nation, twelve candidates, including 
Fletcher, announced their participa-
tion in a Special Mayoral Election, 
although Fletcher is now hoping to 
leave public life. 

Fletcher will soon return to his 
position as UCSD political science 
professor of practice and Senior 
Director of Corporate Development 
at Qualcomm Incorporated. 

at UC medical centers and student 
health centers in the middle of a labor 
dispute,” Senior Vice President for UC 
Health Sciences and Services Dr. John 
Stobo said in a Nov. 18 press release. 
“This is completely inappropriate and 
unfair to the people we are here to 
serve. Our patients and students are 
not bargaining chips. They deserve 
better.”

UCSD students also protested 
along Gilman Drive and throughout 
the university campus on Wednesday 
in solidarity with the AFSCME work-
ers and the UC Student Workers 
Union, who were striking against 
unfair management and intimidation 
practices. 

“We are here to support fellow 
union members and to use this strike 
as a bargaining chip for a new con-
tract to get the administration to give 
in to their demands,” Chad, a UCSD 
graduate student with the United Auto 
Workers, said. “We would like stu-
dents to know that only 9 percent 
of tuition actually goes to teachers 
and education — we want students 
to understand where our increasing 
fees go.” Graduate students of UCSD 
represent the UC Student-Workers 

Union, which includes 13,000 student-
workers such as TAs, GSIs, Readers, 
both undergraduate and graduate, 
and strike in sympathy with AFSCME 
3299. 

“I’m here to support workers and 
organize against unfair labor practices 
on patient care workers, as the UC 
completely went back on their rights,” 
said Revelle College junior Simran 
Anand. “The workers were threatened 
and some lost their jobs.” Students 
joined the rally across the campus 
with the Unfair Labor Practice, UAW 
and AFSCME protesters to show their 
support for the unrest across campus.

On Nov. 18, just two days before 
the strike, a group of students went to 
UCSD Chancellor Pradeep K. Khosla 
to try to get his letter of support for 
the workers with HDH, reinstate full 
lunch hours and an open door policy 
for workers. 

“We wanted him to make a pub-
lic statement supporting the work-
ers, but we were disappointed,” said 
senior Tanner Smith, who is part of 
an ethnic studies practicum studying 
UC labor relations. “The Open Door 
policy is transparent ... it took us three 
weeks just to meet with him, and 
they rescheduled our meeting with-
out notifying us about the change. In 

the end, he refused to give us a clear 
answer and was very ambiguous about 
his decision.” 

Despite the disappointing meeting, 
Smith remains optimistic: “I feel very 
great about the strike; it was great that 
a few grad students were able to shut 
down traffic for a few minutes.”

A.S. Council President Andy Buselt 
also took part in the strike to support 
the AFSCME and UAW protestors.

“We are here as students in sol-
idarity for workers just as workers 
have supported us,” Buselt said. “This 
nine-campus strike is definitely show-
ing the power of all the communities 
across these issues, from Graffiti Hall 
to undocumented student rights. UC 
Santa Cruz shut down because of the 
strike — this is making our power 
known to the administration that we 
are all here in solidarity.”

Custodial and dining workers also 
carried signs in protest. “We were 
promised an increase in October but 
never got it,” said a custodian at the 
2 p.m. protest walk. “We work for the 
students, but we aren’t getting paid for 
the work. We’re not going to stop until 
we win.”

The first thing I noticed at last 
night’s council meeting was a fake 
skeleton sitting regally upon the podi-
um. Public input regular contributor 
Richard Thompson quoted “Hamlet” 
in honor of the skeleton that he 
bought on discount after Halloween, 
and also in honor of promoting 
humanities at UCSD.

In a special 
presentation, 
Interim Vice 
Chancellor of 
Student Affairs 
Alan Houston 
introduced UniversityLink, a new 
admissions program to assist low-
income transfer students from the San 
Diego area. It will replace the current 
TAG program, which will expire after 
this year.

Questions from A.S. councilmem-
bers led to discussions about unre-
lated topics, including the Student Fee 
Advisory Committee, school spirit, 
the Sun God Festival and student art.

One interesting proposal Houston 
shared was to reduce Sun God binge 
drinking by holding a Bear Garden 
concurrent with the festival. You read 
that right: The best way to fight Sun 
God drinking is to serve more alco-
hol. Hey, it might work.

“Beer is not a high-risk liquor in 
the way that students usually consume 
it,” Houston said. “For students over 
21, Bear Garden might provide a 
way for students to kick back, have a 
drink, and then head on over to Sun 
God.”

He then discussed his children:
“I have a 19- and a 23-year-old. 

The 19-year-old is a straight arrow, 
probably never drinks; the 23-year-old 
has been around the block,” Houston 
said. “I can’t imagine something as 
silly as losing either of them to binge 
drinking or someone else drinking 

and driving them. It’s not about liabil-
ity, it’s about the tremendous human 
loss. At some point, I would have to 
call that parent, and I do not want to 
have that conversation.”

Campuswide Senator Simran 
Anand then announced that the space 
formerly occupied by Plaza Cafe will 
be reopened as a new dining hall 

called 64 Degrees. 
Revelle Senator 
Soren Nelson then 
explained the name 
comes from the 
average temperature 

of La Jolla (64 degrees), the year that 
Revelle College was founded (1964), 
and Roger Revelle’s height (6-foot-4). 
A thermometer in the dining hall will 
record average temperatures through-
out the year, with the hope that by the 
end of the year, it will read 64 degrees. 

Next, the A.S. Bylaws Committee 
presented on their work to improve 
efficiency on council. It was informa-
tive and effective, aside from the glar-
ingly obvious misspelling of the word 
“judicial” as “judical.”

The Council Factor of the Week, 
Social Sciences Senator Colin King, 
was introduced as “never afraid to 
speak his mind, always very criti-
cal, but also hard-working.” He was 
honored with the aptly chosen Miley 
Cyrus song “Wrecking Ball.”

Someone nearby him said, “They 
either think you’re a wrecking ball, 
or you’re Miley Cyrus.” I couldn’t see 
who said it, but props for the humor.

And props to Thanksgiving, 
which has become my new favorite 
holiday for getting me out of next 
week’s council meeting, if there 
even is a meeting the night before 
Thanksgiving. For council’s sake, I 
hope there isn’t. To everybody reading 
this, have a good break! I’ll be back in 
two weeks.

Banksy May 
Be Popular, 
But Is He 
an Artist?
sebastian  brady sebrady@ucsd.eduBetween the FrameS

F or the month of October, noted street artist Banksy made New York City a sprawling art gallery, 
spreading his original pieces all across 
the five boroughs. Nightly installa-
tions created a daily rush to see (or be 
photographed seeing) whatever new 
artwork — generally graffiti stencils 
of people or animals on buildings or 
billboards — Bansky made the night 
before. Some pieces were defaced 
almost immediately, and some were 
encased in Plexiglass. “Better Out 
Than In,” as Banksy named his resi-
dency, gave New Yorkers — and the 
rest of the country — something to 
talk about. Hipsters and pseudo-rev-
olutionaries praised the Occupy-ish, 
semi-subversive democratic bent (e.g., 
the words “This site contains blocked 
messages” painted on a wall as a not-
so-subtle jab at Internet censorship) 
of both the work and the means of 
distribution. Stuffy art establishment 
types were unimpressed. In an inter-
view with NPR, New York art critic 
Jerry Saltz derided the pieces: “Banksy 
is not an artist … He’s completely 
conventional … all so obvious. So 
obvious.” I can practically hear Salz 
sniffing with indignant disgust and 
looking down his nose at me for call-
ing Banksy a “street artist” just now.

Despite his questionable status in 
the high-art crowd, Banksy is, prob-
ably because of the mix of striking 
visuals with a message the 99 Percent 
never tires of hearing, downright mar-
ketable — and very, very profitable. 
One of the pieces for “Better Out” 
was “The Banality of the Banality of 
Evil,” a painting Bansky bought from 
a charity thrift shop, altered and then 
donated back to the same thrift shop 
he bought it from. On the website 
biddingforgood.com, the painting auc-
tioned for $615,000. During his resi-
dency, he also set up an anonymous 
stand selling his own work without 
the Banksy name attached. Hardly any 
of the works sold, and those that did 
went for tens of dollars, not hundreds 
of thousands.

Which begs the question: Is 
Banksy really just an act, a name, a 
cultural phenomenon? Does the fact 
that people don’t value his art if his 
name isn’t affixed to it make his art 
less, well, art? There is a case to be 
made that it does. If Bansky’s huge 
popularity is due more to the aura 
that surrounds his name than to the 
work he does, then the work itself 
is irrelevant and cannot define him. 
Instead, Banksy has reached that 
Mobius strip of meta-celebrities that 
are famous because they are famous 
because they are famous, ad infi-
nitum/nauseam. If this is the case, 
Banksy is Kim Kardashian with a less 
luscious posterior.

So the argument goes, at least. 
What this fails to address, though, 
is that people can hardly identify 
the work of any visual artist without 
a name attached to it. Most people 
(author included) couldn’t identify 
a Monet without the painter’s name 
on display, much less distinguish him 
from Manet. Yet we still call Monet 
(and Manet) an “artist.” That’s not nec-
essarily a problem. Without a drastic 
expansion of the humanistic education 
provided to students, it’s totally unrea-
sonable to expect everyone to under-

A DOUBLE 
TAKE
“SIDE SHOW” SHOWS OFF ENORMOUS 
PRODUCTION VALUES AND STRONG MUSIC, 
BUT TRIPS OVER A LACKLUSTER PLOT.
BY NATHAN COOK STAFF WRITER
NCOOK@UCSD.EDU

A  revival of the 1997 Broadway musical that opened with little fanfare, “Side Show” follows the true story of the conjoined-at-the-hip Hilton twins, who were smash suc-
cesses on the vaudeville scene in the 1930s. Now, it returns to 
the La Jolla Playhouse with director Bill Condon (“Chicago,” 
“Dreamgirls”) whose version is a complete re-imagining of the 
show that hit Broadway 16 years ago. Condon’s rendition features 
a number of new, original songs, a fresh cast — some of them 
award-winners and nominees — and an expert team of designers 
to bring this oddball of a musical back to life.

The story of the Hiltons seems a ready-made subject for 
a musical, if a difficult one to put on stage logistically. Some 
practical concerns arise immediately, like how the two actresses 
who play the Hilton twins (Erin Davie and Emily Padgett) will 
dance effectively when literally joined at the hip. Because the 
musical is based on a true story, even more pressing questions 
arise, since the real Hiltons’ story didn’t have the happiest end-
ing: The twins ended up alone, fameless, in debt and dismissed 
to obscurity.

This adaptation manages to dodge the Hiltons’ grim future: 
“Side Show” follows the girls’ rise to stardom, from their begin-
nings as adopted children in England, then their lives as actual 
side show attractions in Texas and, finally, their blindingly 
fast journey toward the upper crust of vaudeville theater in 
New York, thanks to businessmen and fellow performers Terry 
Connor (Manoel Felciano) and Buddy Foster (Matthew Hydzik). 
Both of these men become love interests for the twins, and while 
a conjoined-twin love story might seem like a complex plot to 
take on, neither romance has much weight behind it. While 
the twins’ eccentric and conniving legal guardian, Sir (Robert 
Joy, “CSI: NY”), and the love interest/corrupt business manager 
Connor, are occasional threats, intense conflict never seems to 
materialize; instead, only some awkward romance stories and a 

sweet sisterly love story remain — though we do get some great 
musical numbers along the way.

Because no real conflict pervades the show, its climax falls 
flat. The main antagonist reveals his dark revelations about our 
twins and then the characters shrug and dismiss him; there is 
never any threat that the twins will be harmed, or even incon-
venienced, by this hiccup. They experience little discrimination 
based on their condition, little challenge in their rise to stardom.

Problems with the structure and plot of the show are over-
shadowed by the music and production. Lyricist Bill Russell and 
composer Henry Krieger’s new music add to the solid, if flawed, 
original run they contributed to in 1997. Even the opening num-
ber, “Come Look at the Freaks,” is a toe-tapping, rousing ensem-
ble tune with a central musical theme that will get stuck in your 
head for days. Many of the cast members stand out as incredible 
performers and singers, regardless of the material’s weaknesses: 
The twins have voices that are both vulnerable and powerful in 
their many numbers detailing their private moments. They carry 
most of what emotional weight is produced by the production 
through strong numbers such as “Who Will Love Me as I Am?” 
and “I Will Never Leave You” — both songs that showcase these 
women both struggling to live a normal life and not wanting to 
give up the closeness they have with each other.

Ultimately, “Side Show” is a toe-tapping musical with a 
knockout cast and arresting numbers, but the central story sim-
ply isn’t all that compelling. There are moments of brilliance, 
as in some of the beautiful numbers the twins sing about their 
loneliness, or that their friend Jake sings about his own, but these 
are fleeting. It’s certainly a must-see for fans of musical theatre 
on campus — it’s one of the biggest productions the La Jolla 
Playhouse will likely see for a good while. However, if you’re 
looking for meatier dramatic material, “Side Show” ends up 
being, well, something of a side show.

M arvel’s 2011 “Thor” film was an incredible gamble. Unlike other popular super-
heroes — think Batman, Iron Man 
or Captain America — that are 
grounded more in reality, Thor is 
something of a fantastical character. 

He’s an advanced, nigh-immortal 
alien that wears fancy armor, speaks 
in Ye Olde English and acts like a 
Norse god. But Marvel managed to 
pull it off, all the same, mainly by hir-
ing renowned Shakespeare filmmaker 
Kenneth Branagh to direct. Branagh 

focused in with precision on the, 
well, Shakespearean nature of Thor’s 
family life. The relationship between 
him, his father Odin and brother Loki 
generated real strife — the anger of a 
shunned, adopted prince, the disap-
pointment of a father who sees both 
his sons as failures — Thor dealt with 
large-scale, royal family drama.

In “The Dark World,” director 
Alan Taylor ditches the Shakespeare 
of the first film in favor of channeling 
the goofy, bombastic comic books 
of the 60s and 70s that never took 
themselves too seriously. This time 
around, Thor must stop an ancient 
villain, Malekith the Accursed, from 
using an ancient force known as the 
Aether to turn all the universe to 
darkness. The plot is about as straight-
forward as they come, even if the film 
is anything but; humor, punchlines 
and one-liners abound in this film, 
and it may be the funniest Marvel 
movie yet, with more laughs than you 

can shake a hammer at — including 
a hilarious cameo by an “Avengers” 
character. 

All the major players return, of 
course, from fangirl gods Loki and 
Thor (Chris Hemsworth, “Rush,” 
“Star Trek”) to Natalie Portman 
(“Black Swan,” “Star Wars Episode III: 
Revenge of the Sith”) as the plucky 
scientist-slash-love interest, Jane. Our 
leads are a stolid bunch — Portman 
and Hemsworth have chemistry, 
but the film gives them little time 
to stretch and play with it, too busy 
shuffling them along from Asgard to 
Earth and half a dozen other worlds 
in between. Thor has really grown as 
a character since the first film, both 
more rational in his decisions as a 
ruler and more measured in his plans 
as a warrior, and the accumulated 
experience of three films is in good 
display here. Jane does not fare as

Swing Into San Diego’s Thanksgiving Dixieland Jazz Festival
If you and your group of friends are 

staying on campus for Thanksgiving 
break and are seeking more than 
just your average Turkey Day meal, 
the Annual San Diego Thanksgiving 
Dixieland Jazz Festival (or Jazz Fest, 
for short) might be just the place. 
Instead of the typical Thanksgiving, a 
new tradition of “Friendsgiving” with 
fabulous music and fellowship can 
be made. The festival lasts five days 
(Nov. 27 through Dec. 1) and is held 
at the Town & Country Resort and 
Convention Center in Mission Valley. 
This event attracts people from all 
over the world and has come to be 
considered “the crown jewel of jazz 
festivals.”

The Jazz Fest showcases many 
variations of jazz, such as traditional, 
Dixieland, swing, ragtime and rock-
abilly styles, to cater to all differ-

ent types of music lovers. Some of 
the artists performing include Bob 
Draga, the High Sierra Jazz Band, 
the Bob Schulz’s Frisco Jazz Band 
and Brady McKay. The set list also 
includes some San Diego natives, like 
Jason Waner and the Euphoria Brass 
Band. Each night has different per-
formances in various areas of the 
resort, ranging from bigger concert 
halls to smaller, more intimate rooms. 

If the set list of over 25 artists is 
not enough to reel you in, the cham-
pagne dinner, for those of you over 
21, definitely will. The buffet-style 
dinner includes imported cheeses, 
crackers, delectable salads, different 
cuts of meat, candied yams, mashed 
potatoes, bread rolls and butter and, 
of course, the traditional turkey 
with cranberry sauce. Let’s not for-
get about the best part — the des-
sert menu. The list includes various 
pies and cakes and, of course, lots of 

champagne! For those with a caffeine 
craving, there will also be freshly 
brewed coffee and tea available to 
order. The dinner costs $28 with 
advanced reservation and $30 per 
person at the door and is served from 
3 p.m. to 6 p.m.

The prices for each day of the 
festival ranges from $15 to $45 daily, 
and five-day passes can be purchased 
for $105. Children under the age of 
12, as well as actives in the military, 
get free admission. Even if you don’t 
end up getting your fill of jazz on 
Thanksgiving Day, the event con-
tinues until Dec. 1 and is definitely 
worth checking out, so, bring your 
friends. The Dixieland Jazz Festival, 
with its wide array of food, drink, 
music and togetherness will be one 
musical event you won’t want to miss.

1) If your closet doesn’t have 
lights, hang Christmas lights on 
the rim of the door to illuminate 
your closet. Clip pictures to those 
lights to avoid taping or tacking 
them to your wall. 
2) Attach dryer sheets to your fan 
as a cheap air freshener. 
3) Find furniture or appliances 
from fellow students by brows-
ing UCSD groups, like “Free & 
For Sale,” instead of browsing 
Craigslist or buying new items.
4) UCSD dorms have adjustable 
bed frames that allow you to 
elevate or lower the height of your 
bed. Increase the height of your 
bed to give yourself more room to 
store things underneath your bed.
5) When you go home, buy toi-
letries in bulk. Store them in a 
plastic container under your bed. 
Nobody wants to run out of tooth-
paste...

1) Motivate yourself to study to do 
readings by rewarding yourself with 
small snacks. For every page you 
read — and understand — reward 
yourself with a small piece of candy.
2) Take notes in Times New Roman 
— Internet lore says that it’s the 
fastest font to read, but even if it’s a 
myth, it’s worth a try. 
3) Change the settings in your 
computer to block distractions like 
Facebook and Instagram during 
midterms and finals. You can also 
set your iPhone to “Do Not Disturb” 
mode to silence all calls, texts and 
notifications. 
4) Talk to yourself while you are 
studying. According to Psychology 
Today it is proven to better retain 
information. To be even more effec-
tive, ask yourself questions, and 
explain it to yourself.
5) Spray an unfamiliar scent, like a 
new perfume or cologne, while you 
are studying. When it is time to take 
your exam, spray the scent again to 
jog your memory. 
6) When you’ve got a midterm com-
ing up, Google “site:edu [subject] 
exam” to find many different college 
exams featuring practice problems 
pertaining to that subject.

1) Reheat that pizza you ordered at 
3 a.m. by placing a glass of water 
into the microwave with it. This will 
keep the crust from becoming overly 
tough.
2) If you’re low on dining dollars, buy 
pasta from the dining halls, and then 
put in vegetables from the salad bar 
to make pasta salad.
3) Pour pancake batter into an 
empty ketchup bottle to make no-
mess pancakes.
4) Put a magnetic notepad on your 
refrigerator to quickly jot down what 
foods you need to make grocery 
shopping easier and more cost-
efficient.

1) If you don’t have a beer pong 
table, use a screwdriver to unscrew 
your door off of its hinges and lay it 
on a smaller table or your kitchen 
counter. The same trick works with 
a full-length mirror — just beware, 
things can get messy.
2) Wrap your room-temperature 
beer in a damp paper towel, and let 
it sit in the refrigerator for 15 min-
utes — it’s a quick way to chill beer.
3) If you don’t have a beer bottle 
opener, fold a dollar bill in half 
repeatedly until it is difficult to bend. 
Place the folded bill under the lip of 
the cap and pop it off. Similarly, if 
you don’t have a wine bottle opener, 
stab the cork with scissors and then 
lift the cork out ... or buy one at one 
of the on-campus markets and save 
yourselves the trouble. 
4) Take a multivitamin before you 
drink to combat a hangover. 
5) Drink milk or other dairy-based 
drinks, i.e. Vallarta’s horchata, 
before you go to bed to reduce your 
hangover. Dairy products coat the 
lining of your stomach, which make 
it harder for alcohol to get absorbed 
into your bloodstream.
6) If you want to get drunk with your 
friends for cheap, purchase plastic 
handles, pool your alcohol together 
and mix it with juice, soda and sugar 
to make Jungle Juice. The great 
thing about Jungle Juice is that it 
doesn’t taste that strong and gets 
your drunk quickly. 

COLLEGE HACKS
People tell you that college is the best four years of your life (sometimes seven, if you’re unlucky), but various 

costs associated with college can leave you strapped for cash. Since students constantly have to rebudget, 
you’ll need these useful tips, or “hacks,” to help you make the most of your money and college experience.

@ucsdguardian

A rcade Fire has always made it fun for its fans to be a bunch of discontent, cynical bastards. 
You might think it’d be difficult to 
embrace music that calls your genera-
tion unlikable, empty and lost, but 
that has been Arcade Fire’s strategy 
since the band launched its career 
with “Funeral” in 2004 — and it hasn’t 
lost them fans. Their newest album, 
“Reflektor,” is hardly an exception 
and like its predecessors, it shows that 
bleak, intelligent lyrics over upbeat 
harmonies can mesh together well as 
long as they’re meticulously arranged 
and well-written.

“Reflektor” is notably more dance-
oriented than previous Arcade Fire 
releases, and though this could create 
a huge room for error, its sound is 
as well-arranged and catchy as ever. 
“Here Comes the Night Time” is, in 
terms of sound and arrangement, 
the shining star of “Reflektor,” and 
even with the dance beat, it retains 
the band’s ability to start small, reach 
an enormous climax and then wind 
down seamlessly. It’s the sonic equiva-
lent to sex, and it’s what Arcade Fire 
has always done best.

Other tracks, like “Afterlife,” have 
a similar structure, but that isn’t to say 
that “Reflektor” is a one-trick pony of 
an album — there is refreshing varia-
tion throughout. The closing track, 
“Supersymmetry,” is calm, dreamy and 
drawn out, while “We Exist” is bass-
driven and reps the album’s dance-
inspired vibes. The only weak track is 

“Porno,” which drags for six minutes 
due to the repetitive and completely 
uninteresting synth parts. Given the 
album’s two-hour run time, it would 
have been advisable to trim any excess 
fat, and “Porno” was the fat on an oth-
erwise juicy cut. 

Lyrically, Arcade Fire’s past works 
focused around a single theme, like 
how “The Suburbs” dealt with the 
impersonalization of urban sprawl, 
but “Reflektor”’s subjects are more 
diverse. The title track is clearly about 
alienation caused by technology, 
while “Normal Person” paints youths 
as intolerant pricks who strive for 
uniformity. And as fun as it is to pick 
through an album to find an overall 
message, the lack of an overarching 
meaning keeps the album away from 
repetitive monotony

Other songs, like “It’s Never Over 
(Oh Orpheus)” and “Joan of Arc,” are 
open to some interpretation in terms 
of lyrics. The lyrics are particularly 
abstract and metaphorical in “Awful 
Sound (Of Eurydice)”: “You and I 
were born in a little town/ before the 
awful sound started coming down.” 
Even repeated listens might leave lis-
teners unsure of the exact meaning for 
the songs, but given that Arcade Fire’s 
new sound is interesting and original 
and that most of the tracks hold up 
well, this would hardly be a chore.

ALBUM  REVIEW

well, spending most of the film either 
unconscious or held captive. 

In all honesty, Loki is the star of 
this show. Tom Hiddleston (“Deep 
Blue Sea,” “Midnight in Paris”) has 
truly created a rich and compelling 
villain for the ages, one with righ-
teous anger from royal birthright 
denied, as well as the boyish charm 
of a petulant prince. In “The Dark 
World,” Hiddleston is completely in 
top form. He portrays Loki as the 
villain you want to see succeed just 
about as much as you want to see him 
get what’s coming to him — a villain 
with a constant glint of redemption. 
Whenever he is onscreen, the entire 
film lights up and becomes a multi-
layered, emotional experience on par 
with “The Avengers.”

Unfortunately, most everyone 
else in the film is short-changed — 
most notably Christopher Eccleston 
(“Doctor Who”) as the big, bad 
Malekith, this time around. Eccleston 
is not only smeared in makeup and 
CGI but also made to talk in a knock-
off “Lord of the Rings”-style elf lan-
guage, given an artificially deepened 

voice and speak the most cornball 
“destroy the world” villain dialogue 
we’ve heard since the lackluster 
“Fantastic Four” films. 

This isn’t to say that “The Dark 
World” is a bad film. It’s not. It’s 
a solid popcorn flick with well-
choreographed action and set pieces 
anchored with actual stakes — our 
favorite characters in danger. In 
addition, it bears repeating that this 
“Thor” is legitimately funny, poking 
fun at itself almost as much as it takes 
its “end of the world” plot seriously, 
and it is certainly the most simply 
enjoyable superhero film of the year. 
It has a straightforward plot, great 
laughs and a handful of weightier, 
compelling character moments. For 
the most part, however, “The Dark 
World” straddles the line between 
being a good, enjoyable film and a 
great one. Aside from the Loki scenes, 
it never really goes above and beyond 
the call of duty that we expect from a 
superhero film in a post-“Avengers” 
world.

Newly minted University of California 
President Janet Napolitano has had quite the 
busy inaugural season, facing student criticism 
for her past policies while she was Homeland 
Security Secretary and drawing our scrutiny for 
her suspiciously timed DREAM Act scholar-
ship plan. However, her latest administrative 
effort — to keep tuition steady for 2014–2015 — 
makes perfect sense to us.

Napolitano offered her proposal at a UC 
Regents meeting last week, emphasizing the 
need to continue the three-year trend of stabiliz-
ing tuition rates while expanding the usual rev-
enue channels of grants and philanthropy. Once 
the governor’s official annual budget is released, 
the numbers — particularly the state’s funding 
allocation to the UC system — will demand 
more attention, but it looks to be a step in the 
right direction given the larger pattern of ram-
pant tuition increases over the past decade. As 
in-state students currently shell out over $12,000 
in tuition each year, we can definitely get behind 
any policy that prevents higher costs.

Administrators also brought up the possibil-
ity of the “cohort” plan, in which an incoming 
student’s initial costs would stay constant for all 
four years of their stay. This grants new students 

a needed sense of financial security and helps 
them evaluate whether their education will be 
affordable over the long run, but this proposal 
has its drawbacks. The plan essentially gives the 
UC administrators an unfair license to palm off 
their financial shortfalls on to future incoming 
classes; although it’s difficult to implement, we 
would much rather see tuition hikes definitively 
frozen for all students.

But despite Napolitano’s helpful turn, we 
may not be out of the woods quite yet. The 
UC Regents have yet to approve the admit-
tedly ambitious policy, and the UC system 
needs to find substantial funding from some-
where. Private donations and grants can only 
accomplish so much — the UC fiscal plan for 
2014–2015 reveals that the system has already 
budgeted for an additional $121 million in 
state funding if it is to keep tuition levels stable. 
Unfortunately, Gov. Jerry Brown has indicated 
that after the $142 million UC funding increase 
he signed this year, it’s unlikely that California 
will loosen its purse strings any further.

In order to actually solve the problem and 
help students, both the UC administration 
and the governor will need to be more flex-
ible and compromise. Brown mentioned at a 

recent meeting that he is open to giving the UC 
campuses an additional 5 percent in fund-
ing but that the increase will only happen if 
the Regents’ keep student tuition rates level. 
University administrators, for their part, need 
to find an effective way to work with the 
funding they’ve been allocated; although it 
might require cuts to some campus services, 
the UC system must recognize the importance 
of affordability. 

Brown also needs to prioritize students’ 
interests over political stunts. Last year, 
Brown threatened to cut directly from UC 
funding if his tax plan — Proposition 30 — 
was not passed, which would have resulted in 
students paying nearly $2500 more per year. 
Despite the necessity of the Proposition 30 
legislation, our tuition cannot be held hostage 
for the governor’s political agenda.

So while we applaud Napolitano’s steps 
to limit the damage to our pocketbooks, it is 
important that administrators and the state 
see eye-to-eye on how to avert tuition hikes. 
We hope that this time around, both Brown 
and the Regents will have our best interests in 
mind and give UC campuses the funding they 
need for student affordability.

SUN GOD SAYS...
Let Guests Stay
The Sun God Task Force announced that the Sun God Festival 2014 will no longer allow 
guests, but the new policy does not address health and safety concerns appropriately.

It is clear that the Sun God Festival needs to become a safer event for everyone and that event organizers 
need to take steps to ensure safety, but 
eliminating guest passes is not an appro-
priate first step.

Because health and safety are the 
main concerns for everyone regarding 
Sun God, we need to implement policies 
that can actually address and can change 
these issues. A policy that would force 
students to become more accountable for 
the actions of their guests (as well as their 
own) would see more success and fewer 
student complaints.

The new policy suggests that forbid-
ding guests would significantly decrease 
the number of medical responses or police 
arrests for the event, but with or without 
guests, students will still drink too much 
before they head to Sun God. 

The Sun God Task Force Preliminary 
Report notes that one-third of the 146 
people admitted to detox and detainment 
were non-UCSD affiliates, but it is unfair 
to punish 3,000 guests for the actions of 
the 47 non-affiliates who were detained. 
We imagine that, by ridding Sun God of 
guest tickets, the task force intended to 
eliminate the most highly concentrated 
group of heavy drinkers. But the “go hard 
or go home” culture around Sun God 
doesn’t vanish when you get rid of 3,000 
guests and replace them with 3,000 more 
ready-to-get-“turnt-up” UCSD students.

Furthermore, removing guest passes 
is not just a matter of friends not being 
able to attend the event — it will serve as 
a detriment to the quality of the event. 
Undergraduate students contribute fund-
ing toward Sun God through their student 
fees, but the revenue from selling guest 
tickets — at $65 apiece — is also extremely 
significant. Compare that to student fee 
contributions to this year’s Sun God bud-

get: At $550,000, and with 23,805 enrolled 
students for the 2013–2014 school year, 
each student pays a steeper $23.10. Guests 
make up 3,000 of the roughly 20,000 indi-
viduals who attend the event each year, 
and their tickets bring in a hefty $195,000 
that the festival will either lose or be 
forced to compensate for in 
another way.

Whether or not the $65 
that guests pay “covers” 
the higher proportion 
of medical and police 
attention they attract 
is debatable, but, 
either way, tak-
ing guest tickets 
away will not 
significantly fulfill 
the task force’s 
goal of reducing 
money spent on 
police and medi-
cal services. The 
task force says its 
goal is to change 
campus culture 
and reduce the 
amount of drink-
ing by making 
the Sun God fes-
tival a more “stu-
dent-centered” 
event, but pun-
ishing students 
by taking away 
guest passes will 
only make them 
less receptive to 
future changes, 
even if they’re 
less restrictive.

Force Preliminary Report includes 
a suggestion proposed to prevent 
ticket-scalping by using a radio 
frequency wristband system, with 
wristbands linked via barcode to 
the students’ PIDs. This is a good 
idea, but a costly one to imple-
ment, especially if the festival is to 
see a significant dip in budget. The 
system would cost a minimum of 
$30,000, with an additional cost of 
$2.25 per student wristband.

Instead of limiting the festival 
with a no-guest policy, A.S. Council 
and the Sun God Task Force should 
consider the radio ID system to 
prevent students from acting irre-
sponsibly. The revenue obtained 
from the sale of guest passes could 
finance the implementation of the 
radio frequency ID system; this 
would ultimately hold students 
accountable for the actions of their 
guests and themselves.

By outlining consequences for 
Tritons with registered guests who 
misbehave, administrators can set 
appropriate procedures for dealing 
with rule-breakers, while increas-
ing security to make the event safer 
for everyone. Clear consequences 
and increased accountability can 
convince students to think twice 
before inviting a rowdy friend with 
no respect for campus rules. 

There’s no fighting the fact that 
Sun God needs to change if we 
want to see the festival continue 
for more years to come, and we 
applaud the task force for looking 
into a variety of ways to change the 
festival before they cut it off alto-
gether. But the no-guest policy does 
not address the main issues that 
cause the main problems faced at 
the event. What we need is a policy 
that will put the health and safety 
of our students as the issues on the 
forefront, not one that tells us we 
can’t bring our friends.

GUEST  COMMENTARY FESTIVAL COORDINATORS WEIGH IN ABOUT RECENT CHANGES TO SUN GOD FESTIVAL GUEST POLICY

The Sun God Festival is a 31-year-old tradi-
tion. That’s 31 years shared in the UCSD collective 
memory across not just our alumni but our commu-
nity. And for the past 31 years, each UCSD student-
attendee has driven Sun God to be one 
of the biggest and best college festivals 
in the nation.

With 20,000 attendees, three 
stages and our lineup history, Sun God 
Festival, like UCSD students, truly 
stands in a league of its own. From its 
humble inception in 1983 to its sold-
out crowd last year, Sun God Festival 
has been guided by an unwavering 
vision to build campus community 
and generate spirit through a fun and memorable 
festival environment. Behind the scenes, the Festivals’ 
team works closely with dedicated experts to ensure 
the health and safety of all attendees. However, for the 
past several years, these efforts have reached a stand-
still. We continue to exhaust our resources and budget 
needed to sustain a safe environment, indicated by a 
continuous rise in the number of medical transports 
and criminal activity surrounding the festival. 

As we move forward with planning, we are doing 
all we can to protect the festival’s spirit and intent, 
but major changes are required to take place in order 

to protect the existence of the festival itself. We ask 
that, through these changes, you understand why 
they are necessary and why we also need your input, 
support and partnership to protect our tradition.

Last spring, Chancellor Khosla received a letter 
from Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla expressing 
its deep concern over Sun God Festival’s impact upon 
students’ health and the local community. The level 
of alcohol consumption and drug abuse reported in 
patients that day was dangerously high, and, in some 
cases, life-threatening. 

In 2011, four students went to the ICU and were 
placed on life support. Last year, we sent 48 stu-
dents to the hospital in ambulances because they 
were a danger to themselves and others. These cases 
stemmed from high blood alcohol content (i.e.: 
excessive intoxication) and drug abuse that could 
have been easily prevented. Yet, for every ambulance, 
doctor and bed that a UCSD student occupies in the 

ER, there is one less for someone suf-
fering from a less preventable crisis, 
such as a stroke or heart attack. As we 
strain our local hospitals and resourc-
es, we impact our community at large. 

With almost 500 health and safety 
cases related to the festival in the past 
three years alone, it is apparent the 
current festival format must undergo 
serious revision in order to ensure that 
we can continue this longstanding tra-

dition. It is also important to understand that this isn’t 
just a one-time occurrence unique to last year (or the 
year previous). This is a culmination of years where 
friends have abandoned friends in bushes because 
they couldn’t make it to the festival; where students 
have committed sexual assaults and acts of violence 
against one another as a result of being under the 
influence of drugs or alcohol; where students have put 
themselves and San Diego residents at risk by driving 
under the influence. 

As festival producers, we cannot justify creating a 
high-risk environment where students may feel pres-

sured to participate in dangerous activities. The last 
thing we want is to lose a life of a student, peer or 
friend over a day intended to unite and celebrate the 
campus community. Despite the changes, the festival 
can only do so much onsite since many of our issues 
persist off campus. It is only with your awareness and 
actions that we can keep the festival a tradition, not 
history.

The reality is that the 2014 Sun God Festival 
almost did not happen. The 2015 Sun God Festival 
is far from guaranteed, and this tradition built by 31 
years of students, could end with us. Although many 
of you may not have undergone these experiences 
personally, these are issues affecting your friends and 
peers. As UCSD students, we need to be compassion-
ate enough to see these issues and understand that it 
is our cultural and social responsibility to look out for 
one another. 

Moving forward, the future of Sun God Festival 
lies in our hands, our responsibility and our choices. 
We ask that you remember why we have a festival 
— to celebrate our university and undergraduate 
experiences. We ask that you be kind to one another, 
be a good friend and peer. Report risks before they 
happen that may escalate beyond your control. If you 
choose to drink, do so responsibly without endanger-
ing yourself or others. If you or a fellow festival-goer 
are over-intoxicated and need help, learn about and 
take advantage of the Responsible Action Protocol. 
If you see someone abandoned and confused, guide 
him or her towards safety. 

Over the next few weeks, we will be hosting 
Sun God Open Forums and circulating a survey to 
gather your input, answer your questions and gauge 
which changes will be most effective. Participation 
will be key in helping us form our planning strategy 
to change the extreme culture around the Sun God 
Festival. Please remember that this is our festival and 
it means so much more than just a day to excessively 
party. It is a piece of a tradition much bigger than us 
and extends back to most of our school’s history. Let’s 
not make this the year it all ends. Save Sun God.

M urderesses, girl groups and WikiLeaks. There is truly no end to the range of topics 
director and Oscar-winning screen-
writer Bill Condon has covered in 
film. Despite his involvement creat-
ing two of the most iconic musical 
movies of the 21st century (namely 
“Chicago,” for which he received an 
Oscar nomination and Golden Globe 
winner “Dreamgirls”), Condon had 
yet to helm a musical for the stage — 
until now. In between the release of 
his latest film “The Fifth Estate” and 
production on “A Slight Trick of the 
Mind” starring Ian McKellen, Condon 
is directing a revival of the 1997 
musical “Side Show” at our very own 
La Jolla Playhouse, which will run 
until the production will move to the 
Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. 
next year.

Guardian: What has been most grati-
fying about the whole experience of 
directing “Side Show?”
Bill Condon: It’s a dream deferred to 
direct something from the stage, so to 
have my first experience be so ideal 
has just been extraordinary. It couldn’t 
be a more supportive environment, … 
giving us complete creative freedom 
to discover the best version of a play 

that we want to put on, just an incred-
ible group of collaborators. … [It’s] the 
first theatrical [directing] experience 
for me, and I can’t understand why I 
waited so long.

G: You’ve brought a lot of Hollywood 
experience to the table. But what 
experiences from working on “Side 
Show” will you take to your upcoming 
film projects?
BC: I’ve been thinking about that, and 
I do think that, [from] the extended 
time I’ve had to work with actors on 
this, you get a version of that in mov-
ies. But it’s very, very quick and … 
especially given the caliber of actors 
I’m going to turn up with, like Ian 
McKellen, I think somehow [I need] 
to find a way to do that there; it just 
pays off in such a great way.

G: To what extent are theatre and film 
two sides of the same coin?
BC: For the movies that I always 
liked [they] have theatrical characters, 
things that are just slightly height-
ened, whether [it’s] James Whale in 
“Gods and Monsters” or the people in 
“Dreamgirls” or even Julian Assange. 
They’re all very theatrical people 
— they see themselves as theatrical 
… Movies partially came out of the-

atre, and obviously it’s also a visual 
medium in a different way, but I like 
remembering that theatrical part of 
movies.

G: You do a lot of work based on 
true stories. What do you think is the 
appeal behind adapting a true story 
on to the stage or screen?
BC: I love seeing the dramatic 
structure in someone’s life because I 
think when you do investigate real 
people it’s extraordinary how the most 
extremely dramatic things happen to 
them in a way that might be less cred-
ible enough in a completely fictional 
setting.

G: What do you want audiences to 
take away from “Side Show”?
BC: I think we live in a world of a lot 
of stuff that is ironic and I think the 
thing about “Side Show” that is so 
appealing is that there is no irony; it is 
completely heart-on-your-sleeve emo-
tion. So I hope what they leave with 
are a few tears. If they’ve been moved 
in any way by the twins’ predicament I 
think we will have done our job.

FAQ BILL CONDON

Dating: 
Crazy, 
Stupid, 
Vincent.
vincent  pham  vnp003@ucsd.eduFreshmen   faux  pas

W e were sprawled across the wooden floor of my one-car garage-converted-to-room 
and passed around a bottle of tanger-
ine wine (if you scoff at my drink of 
choice, whatever, I’m poor, and it was 
$5). It was an hour into my birthday, 
and what did we do? Sulked. About 
girls and the status of our love lives. 

I had been dumped a half an hour 
before I turned a year older, but I was 
fortunate to have my two best friends 
with me to recount our romantic 
endeavors. It sounds pathetic, but it 
really was one of the most memorable 
nights we shared, laughing at just 
about anything we had gone through.

So, here I am, going to give you 
my two cents on relationships to all of 
you lovely folk out there. I’m not the 
most well-versed, but I dabble.

First and foremost, there must’ve 
been a reason as to why I was 
dumped — and so untimely. If there 
was one thing I learned from living 
in a temple for a week (though that’s 
another story), it is that our actions 
and behaviors are an inner reflec-
tion of ourselves and that we cannot 
always blame outside forces for caus-
ing events in our lives. In short, it’s 
not you, it’s me (cliche, but true!). To 
apply this to my example, I have come 
to realize that the problem with my 
relationship is that I didn’t know what 
I wanted. It’s as simple as that. (At 
least, I hope it is.)

Because I was unsure of what I 
wanted in the relationship (we were 
just dating), I was unable to act con-
fidently, which resulted in miscom-
munication and unclear signals on 
my part. It’s unfortunate that I put 
someone through my own problems, 
but the takeaway, at the time, was that 
everything is a learning experience, 
no matter how messy.

Then there’s the subject of dating 
itself. I came into college believing I 
should “date around.” I also came into 
college never having gone on a date in 
a traditional sense (previous romantic 
endeavors were led on with “hanging 
out” because I like to be aloof). 

How this worked out is that I did 
not ask girls out on dates, but I did 
keep myself open to meeting new 
people. You don’t have to date around 
if you’re not comfortable with it, but 
be aware that you’re in a situation 
where you are surrounded by thou-
sands of people who happen to be in 
your age range and are going through 
a collective experience called “col-
lege.” That said, you will meet a lot of 
people, so be open.

On top of that, don’t expect every 
relationship with the opposite sex (or 
same sex — whatever floats your boat) 
to become romantic. There is noth-
ing like an amazing group of platonic 
friends with whom you may eventu-
ally sulk over your amorous affairs.

My friends and I always like to 
joke about getting into relationships. 
It’s that self-deprecating humor that 
really motivates us (maybe we’re doing 
this wrong). But at the end of the day, 
with our busy schedules and rela-
tionships not truly the number one 
priority in our lives at the moment, I 
like to believe I’ll be like Shang from 
“Mulan.” I’ll become good friends 
with someone who I thought was a 
man, only to realize that she has been 
a cross-dresser this whole time. She’ll 
save my life and the nation in which I 
live, and instead of professing my love, 
I’ll let her know that she … uh… well, 
that she fights good. 

It’s with this that maybe you’ll real-
ize romantic relationships can arise 
from the least likely circumstances, 
but maybe that’s what you — and I —
want all along. 

Amidst the sea of corporate cof-fee chains found on every street corner and in every shopping 
mall, it’s hard to find an indepen-
dent coffee shop these days, period. 
But one that bakes its own goods 
and trusts its customers enough to 
let them pay later if they’re short 
on cash? That almost sounds too 
good to be true. However, Rebecca’s 
Coffee House is one of those rare 
finds. From the live jazz that plays in-
house to the smells of freshly ground 
espresso and baked goods, Rebecca’s 
offers a homey atmosphere to social-

ize or study at in the very heart of 
South Park.

I first discovered Rebecca’s Coffee 
House during one of my weekend 
explorations of the neighborhoods 
surrounding Balboa Park. As one of 
San Diego’s newest transplants, I had 
lost my way home and was trying to 
find the road back to the freeway. I 
stopped at the intersection of Fern 
Street and Juniper Street and saw a 
group of people lightly chatting out-
side this beautifully decorated cafe 
that had an assortment of Christmas 
lights hanging from the planters and 

trees. I thought I would stop for a 
quick coffee break and be on my way. 
However, the excellent service, music 
and cozy mood of the cafe kept me 
there for many hours.

I was greeted by the owner, 
Rebecca herself, who told me about 
the daily pastry selections and told 
me about the jazz ensemble, Now Jazz 
Trio, which was playing on the stage 
that takes up a good portion of the 
spacious cafe. Local bands like this 
one frequent Rebecca’s on most week-
days and every weekend. There are 
also open-mic nights twice a week.

Rebecca’s is known for its freshly 
made scones. The raspberry scone 
($2.75) was still warm from the oven, 
had fresh raspberries mixed in and 
was served with a homemade straw-
berry jam that was so tasty I was 
tempted to eat it by itself. On most 
days, Rebecca’s sells out of scones by 
the mid-afternoon. However, there 
is plenty more food that patrons can 
choose from. A wide assortment of 
cakes and cookies ($1.75 and up), 
soups ($4), salads ($7 and up) and 
made-to-order deli sandwiches ($7 or 
more) are available.

The drink menu is also varied 
and includes the normal espresso 
fare in addition to smoothies and 
blended coffee drinks such as banana 
mocha freezes, chai latte frappes 
and even holiday-themed drinks 
for gingerbread and eggnog lovers. 
The fancier drinks will cost you $4 
or more, but the espresso drinks are 
well-priced; Americanos are $2.25 

and drip coffee is $1.75. Rebecca’s is 
a cash-only establishment, so be sure 
to stop by an ATM before your visit 
because there isn’t one in the vicinity. 
If you do forget (like I did once) the 
employees will ring you up anyway 
and ask you to pay the next time 
you’re in the neighborhood. 

Rebecca’s comfortable ambiance 
is another reason why it is such a 
desirable place to get work done. 
There’s a good ratio of couches and 
armchairs to sink into to sturdier 
tables that give patrons the option to 
curl up with a book or sit and talk 
with friends, respectively. One wall of 
the cafe is stacked high with various 
board games and books that custom-
ers can take back to their tables to 
enjoy. The rest of the cafe is decorated 
with antique lamps and paintings 
of all sizes that are made by local 
artists. One drawback to the cozy 
atmosphere is the dim lighting, which 
can make it difficult to read or write 
unless you’re sitting directly next to 
a lamp. 

The next time you’re driving down 
30th Avenue in South Park, look out 
for the hand-painted sign at 3015 
Juniper St. that points to Rebecca’s 
Coffee House. Swing by early in the 
morning or throughout the night 
— Rebecca’s is open Monday and 
Tuesday from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. and 
Wednesday through Saturday from 
5:30 a.m. to midnight.  If the sweet 
melodic sounds of jazz don’t lure you 
in, the smell of strawberry scones 
surely will.

REBECCA’S COFFEE HOUSE

stand the finer points of Monet’s tech-
niques and why his style is unique. 
This means, then, that we can’t ques-
tion Bansky’s status as an artist simply 
because people didn’t storm the stand 
he set up during “Better Out” and buy 
all of his anonymous pieces.

Things that more people like 
(e.g., Banksy’s art) are (generally) 
less worthy of being called “art.” The 
fact is, the wider an audience for an 
artwork is, the more difficult it is for 
that artwork to really perform some 
of the more important functions 

of art. One of the functions of art, 
I think, is to dig into the collective 
human psyche and address underly-
ing human problems that are hard 
to think about, like: What does it 
mean to be human right now? What 
really matters, if anything? Why is it 
worth it to endure? People don’t like 
to have their entire existence ques-
tioned, so these are hard, uncomfort-
able problems to confront and they 
are usually ignored.

Does Banksy’s popularity imply 
that he fails to address serious ques-
tions that art, at least to some extent, 
should address? Pretty much. His 

works are by no means illuminating, 
and the we-are-the-99-percent, anti-
establishment-type jabs that pepper 
his work are neither original nor 
profound. In South Bronx, Bansky 
depicted a kid spray-painting the 
words “GHETTO 4 LIFE” on the wall 
while a butler holds a platter of spray 
cans for the child. Presumably, Bansky 
is trying to hold the mirror up to the 
segment of society that appropriates 
urban culture, but he has no connec-
tion to it whatsoever.

That said, Bansky is an extraor-
dinary artistic and visual techni-
cian. The freedom of street art 

enables a versatility of technique 
lost by gallery art, and Banksy uses 
that freedom to near perfection, 
sometimes. So that leaves the audi-
ence with a bit of a quandary. If you 
want to call Bansky an artist, you 
have to assert that art does not need 
to address any metaphysical truths 
or questions but rather just needs to 
look cool. At the same time, if you 
assert that art does need to address 
those things, then you have to reject 
the oftentimes, beautiful work of 
Banksy. It’s not an easy decision to 
make. Fact: The right light makes a 
shallow pool look deep.

The top two teams in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
clashed on Wednesday at RIMAC 
Arena, when the second-ranked 
Tritons met with first place Cal State 
San Bernardino, losing in five sets.

The Tritons took the first two sets 
(25–13, 25–17) but let the lead slip 
through their hands, dropping the last 
three sets. 

UCSD failed to contain San 
Bernardino’s Alexandra Torline, who 
notched a match high 18 kills. Two 
other Coyotes — Tori May and Ashley 
Solis — recorded double-digit kills, 15 
and 12 kills respectively.

Despite, UCSD senior libero 
Brittany Lombardi earned 26 digs, 
to break the all-time single season 
school record for digs with 559 digs. 

“Lombardi’s defensive skills are 
fantastic,” UCSD head coach Ricci 
Luyties said on the weekly online talk 
show, “Triton Talk.” “On the other side 
Lombardi brings some other things to 
the court, she’s a fantastic passer.”

The Tritons still worked good 
games out of junior transfer Caitlin 
Brenton (17 kills and four assists) and 
last season’s All-CCAA Freshman of 
the Year Danielle Dahle, who notched 
16 kills.

The Tritons will wrap up regular 
season play this weekend. On Friday, 
the Tritons will take on Cal State Los 
Angeles on the road. For its last home 
game, UCSD will return home the 
following day to match up against 
Cal State Dominguez Hills, where the 
Tritons will honor four seniors — 
outside hitter Lizzy Andrews, libero 
Brittany Lombardi, opposite Rachelle 
Kinney and middle blocker Sara 
McCutchan. 

Ranked first in the NCAA West 
Regional rankings, the Tritons 
can look forward to the NCAA 
Tournament next week.

The NCAA Division II selection 
show — announcing UCSD’s first 
round matchup, and more impor-
tantly, where the games will be held 
— is scheduled for Monday, Nov. 25, 
at 4:30 p.m. PST.

“I think throughout the season, 
the team has been tested really well, 
which bodes well for these big games 
in the playoffs,” Luyties said. 

The UCSD men’s and women’s 
fencing teams hosted the 18th 
Annual Bladerunner Tournament 
this past Saturday and Sunday at 
RIMAC Arena. The tournament was 
part of the U.S. Fencing Regional 
Open Circuit and drew 295 unaf-
filiated fencers from all across the 
country.

The tournament started off with 
the men’s foil along with the wom-
en’s saber and epee facing off on 
Saturday. The tournament came to 
a close with the women’s foil and the 
men’s saber and epee on Sunday. The 
tournament was formatted so that 
there was direct elimination after the 
round ended. 

“We’re just trying to work out the 
kinks and come together as a team,” 

junior foilist Keric Moore said to 
the UCSD Athletics Department last 
Saturday. “It’s not really important as 
far as collegiate competition goes, but 
it’s good to fence the other up-and-
coming athletes from around the area 
and from out of state that come here.”

At the last event, the UC Irvine 
North/South Duals, the Tritons went 
undefeated against intercollegiate 
teams from California, but this time 
their record wasn’t as pristine.

On the men’s side, UCSD’s best 
results came from team captain 
senior Bryson Abilay finishing with 
silver for the men’s foil after defeat-
ing 49 other saberists. Junior Peter 
Meckling followed close behind as 
he finished with a bronze in the 
men’s foil. Freshman Sean Callaghan 
impressed as well by finishing at sec-
ond from amongst a field of 75 epee-

ists. Sophomore Eduard Zilinskiy 
finished at eighth place for the foil, 
another notable performance. 

The top Triton finisher for the 
women’s saber was sophomore 
Megan Gesner, who finished in sixth 
place. Sophomore Karinne Caissie 
finished in eighth place, accompany-
ing Gesner on the top-eight stand. 

“The men’s freshmen have been 
really impressive — they’ve been 
showing good numbers, and I think 
they’re going to do really well this 
year,” Moore said. “The women’s 
team has a lot of good returners that

T he UCSD men’s soccer team left for Denver, Colo., on Wednesday, where the second-seeded Tritons will meet with fourth-seed 
Simon Fraser in the NCAA Round of Sixteen on 
Friday, Nov. 24.

After a string of unremarkable seasons, UCSD 
makes its first NCAA tournament appearance 
since 2003. With the No. 2 seed, the Tritons had 
a first round bye last Thursday before narrowly 
defeating conference opponent Chico State in a 
penalty shootout, championed by UCSD goalkeep-
er and California Collegiate Athletic Association 
Defensive Player of the Year Josh Cohen, who 
saved three of seven penalty kick attempts.

“It was a big win; it was the fourth time we’ve 
faced Chico this season,” UCSD senior defender 
Gavin Lamming said last Wednesday in a segment 
of the online streamed talk show, “Triton Talk.” 
“Both teams match up well, and emotions were 
high, stakes were high. We knew that if we lost 
that’d be the end of the season. So we just tried to 
make the most of it and grind it out.”

But three rounds deep into the 35-team tourna-
ment, the Tritons have yet to face an out-of-state 
team this season. UCSD will have its chance this 
Friday in its match against British Columbia’s 
Simon Fraser — a team that went to the Final 
Four last season.

Dealt the fourth-seed, Simon Fraser battled its 
way through the bracket, with a first round 5–0 
victory over Riverside-based Cal Baptist University 
last Thursday. The following Saturday, the Clan 
(17–2–1 overall) made waves, upsetting CCAA 
regular season and tournament champion, first-
seeded Cal State Los Angeles 2–1 on the Golden 
Eagles’ home field. 

With one of the most effective front lines in the 

nation — the Clan has the second highest goals 
per-game-average in the NCAA (3.45) — Simon 
Fraser will make for an interesting match up with 
the defense-minded Tritons. UCSD currently has 
the third lowest goals against average in the nation 
(0.5) — with a backline made up of All-American 
Cohen and senior defender Alec Arsht playing 
wide, along with All-CCAA Lamming.

“Simon Fraser is clearly a very talented team, 
whose strengths lie in their attack,” UCSD head 
coach Jon Pascale said. “Our defending has been 
strong all year and will be tested on Friday. 
Our team is focused, ready and excited for the 
opportunity.”

The trio will have its hands full with the likes 
of a multi-faceted Simon Fraser attack. The Clan 
boasts four players who have notched seven or 
more goals this season — most notably Colin 
Jacques. Just a sophomore, Jacques has recorded an 
impressive nine goals and nine assists this season. 
The Tritons will also need to keep an eye out for 
junior midfielder Jovan Blagojevich -— eight 
goals on four assists — as well as 6-foot-4-inch 
striker Carlo Basso — seven goals on five assists 
for the year. 

Despite Simon Fraser’s obvious assets, Arsht is 
confident in his side.

“I love our chances against anyone at this 
point,” Arsht said. “Don’t know what to expect 
from Simon Fraser, but they will be a good team 
for sure.”

The game is slated for 12 p.m. EST on the cam-
pus of first-seed Regis University — a squad UCSD 
may face in the fourth round if the Tritons advance.
