Fall Quarter police reports have revealed that 95 percent of 
campus crimes are theft-related. 

“UCSD crime rates have been pretty consistent throughout 
my 25 years here,” UCSD Police Detective Doug O’Dell said.

He added that there is a pattern to crime on campus. 
“The crime rate is spiky,” O’Dell said. “We’ll make an arrest 

and the crime rate will drop off and then it will start off again, 
with a different criminal, or the original offender. Crooks stick to 
what they know.”

O’Dell said that while going over 2010’s unofficial record, he 
counted nearly 400 thefts. 

Of these, 35 percent of the thefts are of bicycles. The police 
have created measures to prevent and catch bicycle thieves. These 
measures include decoy bikes to lure thieves and extra surveillance 
in areas with more bikes.

“No one area on campus is more popular for thieves,” O’Dell 
said.

O’Dell said he is only aware of three murders in the history of 
UCSD.

One of those occurred last October, when police found the dead 
body of Carlsbad resident Lorena Gonzalez in a burning van in Lot 
701. Another murder occurred in the 2005-06 academic year, in 
which a woman living in the graduate student housing poisoned her 
husband. The first one O’Dell knew of happened in the ’70s, when a 
man in student housing murdered his wife and left her in the trunk 
of his car while he fled the country.

Last quarter, there were 33 reports of theft, injury, vandalism and 
hit-and-runs in the areas surrounding Price Center alone. Violent 
crime, however, was uncommon.

According to O’Dell, the majority of crime during Fall Quarter was 
spread out fairly evenly across the campus. The detective emphasized 
that students’ belongings are often stolen due to carelessness.

ALUMNUS
ARRESTED FOR 
CHILD PORN 
POSSESSION 
By Robert Pond
Staff Writer

Alumnus David Taylor Kaye, 43, 
was arrested on Jan. 21 for secretly 
filming at least seven women 
undressing at an Escondido tanning 
salon. Kaye is also charged with 
15 counts of child pornography 
possession.

“[He is looking at] possibly 
eight years, but there are lots of 
circumstances that can change that,” 
Escondido Police Department Lt. 
Craig Carter said.

Kaye is facing 10 other charges 
that include 
possession of 
a concealed 
firearm and 
destruction of 
evidence. He 
is a Carlsbad-
based attorney 
specializing in 
family law.

Carter said police were informed 
by the Tanning Place owner 
in Escondido, which received 
complaints from clients about a man 
filming the clients. The youngest 
victim was 15 years old

Police then launched a 10-month 
investigation starting in March 
2010. Kaye was arrested on April 
19, 2010, on four counts of secretly 
filming a person, a misdemeanor in 
California. 

The Tanning Place’s Escondido 
location has since closed, according 
to its website.

Video evidence found on Kaye’s 
phone and computers led to his 
arrest and additional charges.

A search warrant was then filed 
on July 22; subsequently, Escondido 
police found additional evidence in 
his home and business.

Escondido police believe there 
may be more victims of Kaye’s secret 
filming.

“We cannot discuss the case 
against him or the evidence now 
that the charges have been filed,” 
San Diego County District Attorney 
spokesman Steve Walker said.

Attorney Sean Leslie, who is 
representing Kaye for this case, 
said he is pleading not guilty to all 
charges. 

Preliminary hearings are set to 
begin in March and initial statements 
are being developed, Leslie said.

Bail has been set at $100,000; 
the amount is typically determined 
by the severity of the crime and the 
client’s criminal history.

Kaye resides in San Marcos. He 
graduated from UCSD in 1989 with 
a degree in economics.

UCSD was one of several 
universities represented at a rally 
against oil company executives held 
on Jan. 30 in Rancho Mirage, where 
a secret meeting was held by energy 
conglomerate Koch Industries and 
Tea Party members. 

The rally was organized by the 
California Student Sustainability 
Coalition, an organization that works 
with universities across the state to 
increase sustainability and awareness. 
About 2,000 protestors, including 50 

San Diegans, showed up with only a 
handful of peaceful arrests made.

“The goal of the protest was to 
really expose that the Koch brothers 
were having this secret meeting and 
continue to raise hundreds of millions 
of dollars to take over our democratic 
elections,” CSSC Campaign Director 
Gabriel Elsner said.

Andrew Breitbart, a frequent 
guest commentator for “Fox News,” 
attended the secret meeting held by 
the Koch brothers.

Babies Can Understand Language More Than You Think
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

By Nisha Kurani
Associate News Editor

Researchers have determined that 
baby talk isn’t as trivial as we once 
thought. UCSD professors conducted 
a study showing that babies just over 
a year old use the same neurological 
pathways in the brain when 
processing language as do adults.

Using MEG and MRI scans, 
radiology professor Eric Halgren 
and his research team located the 

structures in the brain where the 
infants process language.

“The neurobiological process that 
babies use to understand words is 
the same as the processes used by 
adults,” Halgren said. “It’s in the same 
place, it’s happening at the same time 
— more or less  — and it is using the 
same neurocircuits.”

In the study, babies between 14 to 
18 months were shown pictures and 
then played a sound that did or did 
not match the picture. The neurons 
relating to words and meanings 
sent electrical currents, which then 
produced magnetic fields, which were 
observed using imaging technology.

“That’s how we were able to probe 
whether this [brain]wave was related 
to meaning, because babies had the 
meaning in their head from looking 
at the picture, and then we got a 
differential response depending on 
whether it — the word — matched 
the picture, or didn’t,” Halgren said.

The amplitude of the brain 
wave determined whether the 
infants identified the correlation 

between the word and the picture. 
The mismatched words caused a 
characteristic brain wave that has also 
commonly been associated with word 
meaning in adults in the left front 
temporal region.

“If you do this in adults, you get 
this characteristic wave that is called 
the n400,” Halgren said. “It peaks 
about 400 ms after the onset of the 
word, and so it’s called the n400.”

Previously, scientists believed that 
babies used different pathways to 
process words from studies done in 
other parts of the brain. According 
to Halgren, if these regions in adult 
brains have lesions, the person loses 
his ability process to comprehend 
language. If a newborn has lesions 
in these areas, however, they are still 
able to develop language normally.

“Other ideas include that maybe 
[processing language] involved 
the frontal lobe, or it involved the 
right hemisphere, or maybe was all 
over the place, and gradually, it got 
concentrated,” Halgren said.

The researchers conclusion  

determine early signs of mental 
developmental issues in children.

LIGHTS AND SIRENS
to rile up the crowd and insult them,” 
Elsner said. “It was uncalled for.”

The rally began at around 1 p.m. 
Participants marched in front of the 
Rancho Las Palmas Resort, where the 
Koch Industries meeting was held. 

“Getting the Koch brothers into the 
light and showing the American public 
what these brothers are doing is one 
of our strategies to get corporations 
and dirty money out of our elections,” 
Elsner said.

Supreme Court Justices Antonin 
Scalia and Clarence Thomas were in 
attendance at the executive meeting— 
two of the justices who voted in favor 
of protecting corporations, allowing 
unlimited spending on elections. 

The Koch Industries meeting was 
to discuss approaches to the 2010 
elections in light of last year’s Supreme 
Court ruling, which protects their 

unlimited spending.
 “[The Koch brothers] are funding 

far-right wing politicians and groups 
that spread misinformation about our 
government so that they can elect 
politicians who want to deregulate and 
defund our governments institutions 
that safeguard the public,” Elsner said.

The New York Times received a 
leaked invitation to the meeting, 
according to Elsner.

“[The Koch brothers] keep their 
company private by owning 51 
percent of it, so they can do whatever 
the heck they please,” UCSD Student 
Sustainability Collective Director 
Jared Muscat said.

Muscat organized buses to the 
meeting in Palm Springs from San 
Diego. Protestors were also bused in 
from Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. 

“The Koch brothers do a really 
good job of keeping everything they 

do behind closed doors,” Muscat said. 
“But they do an extra special job of 
never having to answer to anyone but 
themselves.”

The Koch brothers invested at least 
$1 million to support Prop 23, which 
would have suspended the “Global 
Warming Act of 2006,” but was defeated 
in the Nov. 2010 election. 

“The Koch ideology is more private 
profits at the expense of the health and 
prosperity of the American people,” 
Elsner said. 

Students from the CSSC are also 
working with partner organizations 
including Greenpeace and ACLU.

“We’ve never been too big of fans 
of the Koch brothers,” Muscat said, 
“They’ve never really cared about the 
environment.”

lmm002@ucsd.edu.

their stuff there,” he said. “They [leave] 
their laptop on [a] table and [leave] the 
library, and then come back several 
hours later. They are not securing their 
property.”

According to O’Dell, about seven 
to 10 years ago, UCSD had a large 
auto-theft problem. During that 
period, O’Dell said about 11 to 12 cars 
were stolen a month. 

“UCSD is a good place for thieves 
to do their business,” O’Dell said.

Now, however, only two to three 
cars are stolen per month, and most 
often occur in the parking lots nearest 
the freeway. O’Dell said this is because 
car thieves are generally not from 
this campus and they find navigation 
confusing. O’Dell noted that inner 
lots are safer, but not guaranteed to be 
crime-free.

In 2010, there were 17 incidences 
of theft at Geisel Library. The items 
stolen were usually MP3 players, 

laptops and backpacks. The UCSD 
police are currently doing surveillance 
work to catch suspects. O’Dell said 
they have recently been successful in 
identifying and arresting suspects who 
frequent our campus. 

It is difficult for the police to gauge 
past success in stopping crime because 
campus police have much smaller 
crime numbers to analyze than the 
San Diego police. Statistics are still 
mostly consistent.

“It’s not like we’re selling a product, 
crime doesn’t work that way,” O’Dell 
said.

Over these past two quarters, 
there have been several wallet thefts 
in the locker rooms at the Main Gym, 
RIMAC Arena and Canyonview Pool. 
The thefts tend to occur in the men’s 
locker rooms and not the women’s, 
leading the police to believe that the 
suspect is male.

The UCSD police have had some 
success in arresting thieves, but their 

success does not necessarily signal a 
drop in crime rates.   

“As soon as one thief is arrested, 
another thief will come in,” O’Dell 
said.

In 2009, there were two categories 
of crime recorded. Property crime 
accounted for 94.93 percent of crime 
on campus, while violent crime 
accounted for 5.07 percent. 

Property crime was made up 
of 84.17 percent larceny/theft, 
8.61 percent burglary, 6.71 percent 
motor vehicle theft and 0.52 percent 
arson. Violent crime was made up 
90.32 percent of assault, 6.45 percent 
robbery, and 3.23 percent forcible 
rape. 

All figures were taken from 
University of California Police 
Department Annual Report and Crime 
Statistics.

President Barack Obama’s Jan. 25 State of the Union Address was banal, idealistic and unorigi-
nal. Every year, regardless of who’s 
president, we are guaranteed boundless 
convictions of American exceptional-
ism and trite themes like “Innovation 
through Greatness,” which sound more 
like a middle-school writing contest. 

      Nor does the speech show any  
change in vision for Obama despite 
humbling midterm election results. 
His plan for a glorious future: govern-
ment activism and austerity measures. 
His proposed five-year freeze of non-
security discretionary spending would 
save $40 billion a year, but the result is 
laughable when this year’s deficit alone 
is projected at $1.5 trillion. 

Medical malpractice reform and 
consolidating bureaucracy, too, are 
the budgetary equivalents of owning 
a Benz and buying cheap floss to get 
out of debt. Obama demands greater 
investment in high-speed rail and 
wireless access, then calls for meager 
deficit-cutting measures. Although 
we’re a far cry from being unable to 
pay back creditors, the lip service to 
the deficit is unsettling. 
   Obama is the eighth consecutive 
president to advocate energy inde-
pendence. He’s also likely to become 
the eighth consecutive president to 
continue sucking the oily teats of Saudi 
Arabia. Our parents thought solar 
energy would be widespread by now, 
but it appears not even our children 
will taste relief from black gold. The 
money invested in clean energy will 
come from cutting subsidies to oil 
companies — the same ones funding 
clean energy research. Subsidies for oil 
companies (like Chevron) will now be 
diverted toward companies investing in 
renewable energy (like Chevron). Now 
there’s change you can believe in.

There was a silver lining to his 
speech: He promised to continue free 
trade agreements with South Korea, 
making Hyundais much cheaper for 
Americans. Onerous regulations will 
also be reviewed to relieve the burden 
for small businesses. This will be sig-
nificant, considering regulations cost 
businesses $1.75 trillion a year.

Obama plans to make permanent 
the American Opportunity Tax Credit 
($10,000 refundable credit for families 
that make less than $160,000 or single 
parents that make less than $80,000 
paying for four years of college) and 
expand Pell Grants. Sure, affordable 
education is great, but it won’t matter 
much if graduates are entering an abys-
mal job market. 

None of this is to say that the 
Republican responders’ speeches had 
any merit. Congressman Paul Ryan 
(R-Wis.), who either had pink eye 
or was high, rambled on about lim-
ited government and was even more 
vague in his talk of reducing debt. 
Considering Ryan voted for the com-
pletely unfunded Medicare Part D (esti-
mated cost: $534 billion) without any 
other revenue offsets, he lacks credibil-
ity when it comes to fiscal responsibility.

The effect of spending too much 
is less money for investment in the 
future, stunting our growth across all 
sectors. Once the economy has recov-
ered, the political class needs a plan 
for realistic cost-cutting measures that 
address our never-ending deficit. 

That Catchy 
Slogan 
Won’t Solve 
Anything

By Wafa Ben Hassine
President, Associated Students

Several students from the Associated 
Students met with Christine Bagwell, the 
Associate Director of Academic Computing & 
Media Services, and Debbie McGraw from the 
Senior Vice Chancellor of Academic Affairs, 
on Jan. 14, 2011, to discuss the proposed 
“Instructional Technology” fee. Following the 
meeting, we reviewed the proposal and agreed 
to not support the implementation of the pro-
posed fee. 

The Associated Students, as official repre-
sentatives of the UCSD undergraduate popu-
lation, are strongly against the instructional 
technology fee for three fundamental reasons: 
the audacity to administer a new fee given the 
current student financial condition, the lack of 
statistics to justify the technological changes 
and a lack of student representation in the 
drafting of the proposal.

First, given the current circumstances, the 
UC Board of Regents already cut $500 million 
from the UC budget and have raised “educa-
tion fees” by 8 percent this year and 32 percent 

the year prior. Demanding another fee from 
students is adding salt to the wound. Therefore, 
not only does ASUCSD fundamentally disagree 
with such a proposal, but is especially troubled 
with its timing. With the current fee hikes, 
students today are struggling to simply make 
ends meet.

Second, “Instructional Technology” suggests 
that students desire technological changes on 
campus, yet no such hard data or studies have 
been presented to support such a claim. The 
proposal does not provide any assessment of 
the current condition of technological systems 
on our campus, and fails to provide a clear 
financial breakdown of how they would allo-
cate the funds received from students. Students 
should not and cannot afford to be treated as 
an unlimited source of funding.

Third, if the instructional technology fee 
were to pass, it would be the first time in 
UCSD history that students would be charged 
based upon the number of academic units 
taken. We believe that this would open up a 
Pandora’s box of issues for students. 

Fees such as the one proposed will signifi-
cantly impact students’ financial condition 

if they decide to take more units. Although 
we agree with the Committee on Educational 
Policy and Courses’ assessment that student-
based fees should not be used to fund instruc-
tional support services, the Associated Students 
further disagrees with any gradual introduction 
of the fee.

We cannot support any new fees unless we 
have the opportunity to vote and unless we are 
presented with a specific budget detailing the 
exact distribution of student fees. Students and 
faculty share the concern that if this proposal 
passes, it will inevitably lead to the implemen-
tation of more fees through methods that lack 
student representation. 

Students resent the idea that a proposal 
requiring their own funds was drafted with-
out any student input, and would be further 
imposed without a student vote. 

This proposal bypasses the direct voice of 
the students and attempts to impose fees in an 
indirect and unaccountable fashion. We ask 
that in recognition of the financial hardships 
students are undergoing, such fees would be 
proposed only with the consent of those paying 
for it.

UC Irvine’s Martin Luther King “lunch special” of chicken and waffles is not only 
offensive, but a lazy attempt at activism.

By Cheryl Hori

A Lesson Not Learned

After all the protests, speeches, demon-strations and media coverage of Winter Quarter 2010’s “Compton Cookout,” you 
would think that the University of California as 
a whole might have learned how to avoid racially 
related media coverage. But here we are, exactly a 
year later, and this time it’s UC Irvine in the spot-
light for its poor judgment. 

On Jan. 19, in celebration of Martin Luther King 
Jr.’s birthday, UC Irvine’s Pippin Commons served 
its “Holiday Special: Chicken and Waffles.” The 
insensitive menu selection, based off stereotypical 
African-American foods, stirred up enough contro-
versy on the Irvine campus to draw national media 
attention. 

UCI, however, wasn’t alone in its poor judg-
ment: UCSD’s Canyon Vista held its own Martin 
Luther King Day menu that included collard 
greens, cornbread and fried catfish. The Canyon 
Vista menu didn’t trigger much of a reaction here, 

but it appears that dining department planners at 
both schools need to take a hard-earned lesson 
from last winter’s handbook on racial sensitivity. 

The dining halls’ inclination to commemorate 
Martin Luther King, Jr. with a special menu is baf-
fling to begin with. We don’t celebrate the legacies 
of Cesar Chavez or Christopher Columbus with 
foods that have a tenuous connection — at best — 
to Mexican or Italian culture. They are celebrated 
for their achievements and not for their race, just 
as King should be, because his message advocated 
equality for everyone.

By serving southern foods that have little appar-
ent connection to King beyond racial stereotypes 
(neither served his favorite food, pecan pie), the 
dining halls’ menus made an unnecessary racial dis-
tinction that doesn’t honor the civil rights activist.

Marshall College sophomore Olamide Noah 
found the Canyon Vista menu personally offensive. 
“I’ve experienced way too many ‘black jokes’ that 

pick upon seemingly typical African-American 
meals to find that at all humorous or politically 
correct, especially when used to celebrate a holiday 
in the name of a historical black figure,” Noah said. 
“[The menu] seems a lot more like ridicule.” 

On the UC Irvine campus, the Black Student 
Union was not about to allow the dining hall menu 
to pass under the radar. “I understand people have 
prejudice and ignorance,” UCI BSU chairman 
Ricardo Sparks said. “But this is out in the commu-
nity and nobody is saying anything about it.”

Martin Luther King represents activism and a 
constant battle for equality. That battle for equality 
is far from over, and if schools really want to honor 
the civil rights leader, they should focus on events 
in the spirit of his universal teachings, not his racial 
background.

A menu change, no matter how well-inten-
tioned, teaches nothing about the issues that MLK 

See MLK, page 5

oPINIoN MoNDAY, JANUARY 31, 2011 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 5 

worked so hard to bring to national 
consciousness. 

The din-
ing halls did get 
something right, 
though: They’re 
an ideal location 
to promote any 
event or activity. 
Everyone’s gotta 
eat, and at one 
time or another, 
nearly everyone 
stops in.

Organizers should have used the 
dining halls to promote awareness 
events and campus speakers, all of 

which are far more effective routes in 
commemorating one of the great civil 
rights leaders. The campus should 

focus its energy 
on promoting 
events like the 
MLK parade and 
rehabbing the 
Sherman Heights 
Community 
Center. Let’s be 
honest — the 
Saturday before 
midterms week, 
most probably 

didn’t even hear about any of the 
events. 

In contrast, hanging a menu does 

nothing. Although they were intend-
ed to commemorate a great leader, 
they represent yet another instance of 
low-effort activism, much in the same 
vein as a “Save Darfur” t-shirt or $5 
Starbucks water bottle that sends 3 
cents of every bottle to improving 
water conditions in Africa.

The age of Facebook petitions 
and Twitter posts may foster some 
worthwhile impact, as in the case of 
civil rights movements in Iran and 
Tunisia. The supposedly commemo-
rative dining-hall offerings, however, 
make a bleaker statement: that often, 
our modern efforts at activism are 
comprised by misunderstanding, lazi-
ness and — in this case — ignorance.

Dear Editor, 
For two years my roommate and 

I constantly heard stories of our 
friends hating their roommates — 
not to say that we don’t have stories 
of our own.  
     One time, my roommates came 
in at 3 a.m. after a night of partying 
— somehow they found vuvuzelas 
— and thought it was fun to blow 
them in my ear while I was sleep-
ing. Needless to say, I almost shit 
myself.  
     This was when we had an idea 
to create a website where students 
can vent and tell their funny and 
horrible stories to the world. And if 
you hate your roommates and can’t 
stand them anymore, we will be 
rolling out a new roommate finder 
search.  
     Let’s face it: Craigslist is a bit too 
creepy and it’s hit-or-miss, and the 
UCSD commuter services are close 
to worthless.  
     Now try to do this, try to 
remember the worst thing your 
roommate has ever done to you 
right now. 

Take a couple seconds and 
think. Has she or he not done his/
her fair share of the dishes? Has 
he not taken a shower for a week? 
Is your roommate sleeping with 

half of the Greek life? If you have a 
funny story to tell, visit http://www.
h8myroom8.com and share it with 
us, and the world.  
     This brand new website is 
made by two fourth-year UCSD 
students, for UCSD students (for 
now). It is an “FMyLife” type web-
site where you can up-vote and 
down-vote stories, and also share 
them through social media such as 
Facebook and Twitter.

 For example, one of the more 
vile stories that a user posted (poor 
guy) says, “Today, my roommate 
spilled bong water all over my new 
Snuggie. I HMR!” On the other 
hand, there are mild stories, but 
ones that everyone can relate to 
such as this: “Today my roommate 
threw all of my leftovers down the 
garbage disposal because they ‘had 
been in there for weeks.’ I just made 
the food last night. I HMR.”

AS MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS 
AMONG COLLEGE 
STUDENTS CONTINUE 
TO RISE, UC 
SCHOOLS 
GEAR UP.

College kids are a sad bunch. According to the National Association of Mental Illness, one in three college stu-
dents have reported prolonged periods of 
depression and one in four report hav-

ing suicidal thoughts or feelings.  
And suicide remains the second 

leading cause of death among 
15- to- 24-year-old students

“Approximately 
50 percent of 

students might 
experience a 
mental condi-
tion at some 

point of their 
tenure at UC 

San Diego,” 
Director of 

Counseling and Psychological Services Dr. Reina 
Juarez said in an e-mail. “It might be a normal 
byproduct of life circumstances such as a phase-
of-life condition or an adjustment disorder to 
change and difficulties integrating, or it might 
be a more severe mental disorder such as panic 
attacks, an eating disorder, major depression or 
a bipolar disorder with psychotic features, or a 
delusional disorder.”

Though adolescent students and those in 
their mid-twenties have, historically, always been 
at the highest risk of developing mental issues 
— 37 percent of students who received counsel-
ing at UCSD’s Counseling and Psychological 
Services last year reported seeking help prior to 
receiving CAPS treatment — the past few years 
have witnessed a sharp spike in reported issues. 

Healthcare professionals attribute the rise to 
a combination of an increase of mental health 
awareness and ever-heightening pressure on col-
lege students to constantly perform at their best.

“Students’ lives mirror and parallel the world 
that surrounds us,” Juarez said. “With the allure 
of achievement, affluence, material success and 

technological advancements which afford us 
instant information and communication, 

there is more pressure … on students 
who have already been working at 
full capacity for the longest time. 
Most students have not stopped 

What do you get when you cross a biology nerd with YouTube stardom? UCSD alumnus Dr. Tim Lee was supposed to be a 
stuntman — or so his parents believed, endowing him with the 
middle name “Xtreme.” Lee turned that dream down to study 
biology, graduating magna cum laude from UCSD in 1993. 
From there, Lee went on to work at the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography, then spent six years working on his PhD at UC 
Davis.

Then he abandoned the world of term papers, research and 
academia for a more volatile course: stand-up comedy. Lee said 
the change of heart wasn’t expected.

“I never performed for anyone before I finished grad school,” 

Lee said. “I grew up in a pretty small town, so I knew that if I 
sucked on stage, I’d have to hear about it over and over again.”

At UCSD, Lee wasn’t much of a class clown, either.
“The only way I knew he was in the second course I taught 

that he was in was that he showed up with the highest test score,” 
Barbara Taylor, one of Lee’s biology professors at UCSD, said. 
“And I thought, ‘Tim Lee is in this class?’” 

Only once Lee had committed to six years of graduate school 
did he realize that academia wasn’t for him.

“I just didn’t want to read any more papers,” Lee said. “I didn’t 
want to write any more papers.”

INFOCUS “THE FUTURE” UNIVERSITY GALLERY ART EXHIBIT

Last week, UCSD’s Visual Arts Department presented “The Future,” an exhibition curated by graduate student Lara Bullock that showcased pro-fessional artists from across the United States.
Housed in the University Art Gallery, the exhibit featured about six works 

expressing each artist’s take on what lies ahead, from a trash can filled with black 
fortune cookies to a projector playing two side-by-side videos of a chicken peck-
ing its way through words made of grain. One installation featured a surveillance 
camera that displayed visitors’ faces and upper torsos on a fluorescent white wall 
amidst beams of varying shades of gray light. Another piece was a transparent 
cat constructed from gold and silver foil, clear plastic and wood sticks. The venue 
was a warehouse just large enough to accommodate the art and about 50 viewers. 

Guests were encouraged to dance to the modern music flowing from speakers 
as they enjoyed the art. The University Art Gallery presents three exhibitions per 
year, one each quarter, at the venue in the Mandeville Center on campus.

Alumnus Takes Inspiration from UCSD Biology Degree for Jokes in Stand-Up Comedy Routine
“At my graduation from the PhD pro-

gram, several people asked me where I was 
going next,” he said. “I jokingly told them, 
‘I’m going to become a comedian.’ I didn’t 
realize that was true.”

Lee also didn’t realize his potential for 
viral success; today, his YouTube channel 
boasts over three million views. It was a 
change of scenery, following a move from 
Davis to San Francisco, that first inspired 
Lee to branch out. 

“In San Francisco, I discov-
ered I could go out, get brutally 
shot down by a woman, and the 
next day, no one knew about it,” 
Lee said. “I had wanted to try 
comedy for a while. I knew now 
that if I had a bad performance, 
I wouldn’t have to hear about 
it over and over again. I could 
try, fail, improve, all in private. 
I picked a Laundromat with an 
open mic across town and I 
tried my jokes,” he said. 

Staying true to his roots, Lee 
took a scientific approach to 
comedy: a journal documenting 
each joke’s reception allowed 
him to analyze the data quan-
titatively. He got better, eventu-
ally landing a few paid gigs. 

Lee’s style is like that of a 
sarcastic university professor, 
deadpanning in carefully timed 
monotone as he clicks through modified 
PowerPoint slides. 

It’s a mix of standup and science that 
channels the class clown just as much as the 
lecturer with leather elbow patches on his 
sweater.

“I did my first PowerPoint jokes in grad 
school” he said. “As an undergrad at UCSD, I 
loved it when my professors threw gag slides 
into their lectures,. When I started giving 
talks in grad school, I decided I would throw 
some gag slides in as well. That was my first 
experience with PowerPoint comedy.”

 In his favorite sketch, Tim pulls up a 
slide with diagrams of uranium molecules 
on it. He gives a brief lesson on nuclear fis-
sion and chain reactions. He then relates it 
to what goes on in a Raiders bar.

“Just like uranium atoms, the Raiders 

fan is inherently unstable,” he says, clicking 
over to the next slide, replacing the “U” on 
the diagrams, which stand for the uranium 
molecule, with the Raiders-fan “R.” 

“There’s a certain probability of him 
breaking down and striking his neigh-
bor.” And with another click, the “Raider 
Molecule” is shown to start a chain reaction 
labeled with an arrow labeled “cold cock,” 
until all the “Raider Molecules” are “trans-
formed,” or presumably knocked uncon-
scious. 

The practiced 
deadpan of a monot-
onous professor 
and clever use of 
PowerPoint timing 
give Tim a unique 
edge.

“I’ll start with 
some conventional 
stand-up, then I turn 
on the PowerPoint 
and the audience will 
usually laugh at the 
concept of me giv-
ing a lecture dur-
ing my stage time, 
 he said. “It’s a lot 
of fun to watch their 
faces.”

Today, he’s book-
ing shows all over the 
country and has been 
acclaimed by newspa-

pers like the New York Times and the San 
Francisco Examiner. But Lee’s path to YouTube 
notoriety had its fair share of road bumps.

“Many acquaintances wanted to see me 
fail,” Lee said. “If I failed chasing this dream, 
then it [would] validate their decision not to 
chase their own.”

In touring the country, Lee said there are 
times when life on the road throws him off. 
For Lee, the lonely nights aren’t much of a 
price to pay.

“There are moments when I’m stuck in 
a hotel room by myself  when I think about 
how nice it’d be to have a normal social life,” 
he said. “Then I get on stage and all those 
thoughts disappear. I love what I do.”

“In San Francisco, I discovered I could go 
out, get brutally shot 

down by a woman, and 
the next day, no one 
knew about it. I knew 
now that if I had a bad 
performance, I wouldn’t 
have to hear about it 
over and over again.”

respect.CAPS Officials Say On-Campus Mental Health Problems Have Increased, Think Internet May be to Blame going since they started attending pre-school.”
Juarez’s colleagues agree with the doctor’s assessment. 
“Absolutely, I have seen increase in mental health 

needs at University of California, and all over the coun-
try,” Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs at UC Santa 
Barbara and co-chair of the UC Student Mental Health 
Oversight Committee Michael Young said. 
“We’ve seen an increase in the numbers and 
severity. I don’t think anyone yet under-
stands what all of the factors are.”

Associate professor of psychiatry and 
UCSD Medical School Assistant Dean of 
Student Affairs Christine Moutier added to 
the sentiment.

“In the 11 years I’ve been working on 
faculty, I do believe that we have seen an 
increase in just the prevalence of mental 
health issues,” Moutier said. “There’s evi-
dence of this in terms of objective data, in 
terms of the amount of health-seeking that 
students are doing — not just at our cam-
pus, but nationally.”

According to Juarez, the Internet is 
partially to blame for this increase in on-
campus mental health issues. 

“Although we might be more connected 
through the Internet with the world and 
our personal acquaintances, family and 
friends, there is also less time to rest, relax, 
reflect and restore — we are sleeping less, 
exercising less and oftentimes, neglecting our nutritional 
needs,” Juarez said. 

Students’ preoccupation with social networking often 
masks those anxieties. 

“There is a failure to recognize early signs of distress 
to prevent it from escalating into a downward spiral as 
our minds continue to spin,” she added.

School officials have become increasingly aware 
of the need to revamp mental health services. Four to 
five years ago, student health centers were seeing about 
15,000 to 16,000 students a year — a figure that has been 
steadily increasing.  

Young expects to have a rough estimate of the total 
figures by the end of the current school year.  

“All of the centers are reporting that they’re at capac-
ity,” Young said. “All of the health centers require addi-
tional resources.”

As a result, in December 2005, the UC-wide Student 
Mental Health Committee was charged with reporting 
and assessing the mental needs of students. On Sept. 5, 
2006, the committee reported that UCSD had seen an 
increase from 2000 to 2005 in the number of students 
admitted into psychiatric care, as well as an increase in 
suicidal behavior. 

Ultimately, the committee concluded that “the 
increased need by students for campus mental health 
services has resulted in an overtaxed delivery system at 
UC that falls significantly short of meeting the actual 
student demand and expectation for services.”

“We just needed more capacity, more resources,” 
Young said. “Most of our campuses were below the 
national standard set for psychologists. National stan-
dard says we should have one psychologist for every 
1,000 to 1,500 students. Most UC campuses, on average, 
were at one psychologist for every 2,300 students.  Some 
progress has been made with the new mental health 
money, but some campuses — including mine — lost 
ground with the budget cuts.”

The committee recommended a three-tiered program 

to remedy the issue: Restoring critical mental health ser-
vices, targeting interventions for vulnerable groups and 
moving beyond basic prevention efforts. 

According to Juarez, funds at UCSD have doubled 
thanks to the Student Mental Health initiative.

“We grew from 13 psychologists to 19 and from four 
hours of psychiatry to 1.65 full-time equivalent, which 

ensures psychiatric coverage every 
day,” Juarez said.

UCSD’s mental health policy is 
hands-on. CAPS has mental health 
screenings and outreach programs 
in order to spread mental health 
awareness, through programs like 
Red Folder training and Campus 
Climate training. 

Student Wellness and the 
Student Health Center have also 
recently undergone restructuring, 
making its new goal to educate the 
body, as well as the mind, by pro-
viding counseling and recreational 
workout vouchers for Pilates or 
yoga. 

The office of Student Affairs 
has also pioneered the “See 
Something, Say Something, Do 
Something” initiative to promote 
further awareness.

Juarez said that the results of 
the awareness campaign have been 

staggering.
“Last year CAPS saw 2,654 individual students who 

sought individual counseling, couples counseling, fam-
ily counseling, group counseling, psychiatric services 
and crisis intervention for an approximate total of 12, 
215 units of clinical services,” Juarez said. “We delivered 
approximately 1,296 outreach programs to the students 
and provided 2, 675 consultations to faculty and staff on 
matters related to students of concern,” she said. 

Though the number of patients has been on the rise, 
the top mental disorders have remained the same over 
the past five to 10 years. Additionally, suicide rates at 
UCSD (roughly two students commit suicide “out of the 
blue” ever year) have remained stagnant.

“Depression and anxiety are the most common men-
tal health problems in the world, including the United 
States and college campuses,” Moutier said. 

Despite the puzzling numbers and increased atten-
tion on mental health, professionals remain aware of the 
possibility that many more students may still need to be 
diagnosed.

“I’m very concerned about [under-diagnosis],” 
Moutier said. “UCSD is concerned about that. [Vice 
Chancellor of Student Life Penny Rue] has made it one 
of her top priorities.”

Juarez affirmed that UCSD’s psychological staff con-
tinues to worry about under-diagnosed students. 

“I am concerned about students who would benefit 
from counseling and who are not seeking our services 
because they worry about being stigmatized and being 
discriminated against,” Juarez said.

“We need to encourage all students to avail them-
selves of our services when they want to grow and 
develop with the support of a life coach, or manage their 
emerging mental disorder so that it may be contained 
and managed with the appropriate interventions, which 
also results in growth and development.”

Humboldt dominated the play in the first 
period, owing in part to solid play from six-foot 
forward Bree Halsey — who led the Lumberjacks 
with 10 points and 8 rebounds — and poor 
Triton shooting. UCSD went 9-37 in the first 
half, but was able to cut a nine-point Humboldt 
lead to three by the end of the half.

The Tritons rallied in the second half, shoot-
ing 45 percent from the field. Freidenberg also 
caught fire, scoring 14 out of her 20 points in the 
second period, while Triton freshman forward 
Erin Dautremont and freshman guards Nicole 
Anderson-Jew and Elaina White all made major 
contributions down the stretch.  

Humboldt went on an 8-0 run with just 
under four minutes remaining, putting the 
Lumberjacks up by three. A jumper by White, 
followed by a field goal from Freidenberg, put 
the Tritons back on top, but a pair of free throws 

from Jeanette Dewitt gave the home team the 
advantage with 30 seconds left.  

The Tritons pushed the ball down the court, 
when Anderson-Jew found Feder behind the 
arc with 14 seconds remaining. Feder knocked 
down the three-pointer to put the Tritons up 
63-61, to hold on to the win.   

With the pair of wins, the Tritons improve to 
10-4 in the conference, putting them in the fifth 
position in the California Collegiate Athletics 
Association.  With eight games remaining in the 
regular season, the Tritons remain in hot pursuit 
of a playoff berth.

UCSD will head back home for its next four 
games. The Tritons will face off against San 
Francisco State on Thursday, Feb. 3 and Cal State 
Monterey Bay on Spirit Night, Saturday, Feb. 5.

Ring said. “There’s more pressure on the setter 
when you’re setting the quick, and I felt like 
we stepped it up to that challenge and got the 
job done.”

The Warriors came to Saturday’s match 
ready to fight, and the Tritons were unable to 
keep up the fire they had on Friday. The games 
were close, at 25-21, 25-20, 20-25 and 25-20. 
The Tritons delivered on the offensive side, hit-
ting at a season-high .348 clip. But Hawaii was 
even better, hitting .424 on the match.

“Tonight, two things happened,” Ring said. 
“They came out like a team that was disap-
pointed or frustrated with the loss last night, 
and we came out like a team that was maybe 

satisfied with getting a split.”
Ross showed 12 kills and hit .706 with no 

errors in 17 attacks. Bannan collected 43 assists, 
bringing him 37 away from breaking Brooks 
Dierdorff ’s record of 3,867 assists to become 
UCSD’s all-time leader.

“We’ve got to make our opponent 
play more balls than they make us play,” 
Ring said. “They played a good match; 
they were a little hungrier tonight.” 
    The Tritons will face Hope International on 
Tuesday, Feb. 1 at 6 p.m. at RIMAC Arena in a 
non-conference match.

SWIMMING & DIVING — The 
UCSD men’s and women’s swim and 
dive teams wrapped up their regu-
lar seasons this weekend, losing to 
University of Hawaii, University of 
Wyoming and San Diego State in 
consecutive days. The Tritons will 
now focus on conference champion-
ships, which are only three weeks 
away. 

At senior day on Saturday, seniors 
Chris Baier, Kyle Begovich, Sam 
Duimovich, Jessica Ferguson, Emilie 
Schnarr and captain Anju Shimura 
were honored before the meet to 
commemorate their years of commit-
ment to the team.

“It’s a little bittersweet,” Shimura 
said. “It’s nice to be done with dual 
meets, but I am going to miss it, too.”

The Triton women had consecu-

tive multiple-team meets on Friday 
and Saturday, and fell to Hawaii 
157-84. On Saturday, they fell to 
Wyoming 226-72 and San Diego State 
207-86. The Triton men fell to Hawaii 
150-88 and to Wyoming 147-96. On 
Saturday, the Tritons’ fate was little 
different, as they lost to Wyoming 
182-118 and fell to Hawaii 206-94. 

Despite consecutive losses, the 
Tritons had many strong perfor-
mances, and began to settle into their 
final race slots before their biggest 
races of the season.

“We are using this as an opportu-
nity to get ready for our conference 
championship, which is three-and-a-
half days long, so it’s a good lead-up,” 
head coach Scott McGihon said. “We 
talk at length about how to prepare 
their bodies and how to recover emo-
tionally and mentally.”

The Tritons have been switching 
around their lineup since their season 

resumed after winter break,, trying to 
find the best event for everyone to be 
racing in, but have now made their 
final adjustments.

“There’s a lot of sleep and a lot of 
recovery in between,” junior captain 
Michael Lorch said. “The first meet 
isn’t hard; the second one is the hard 
one.”

McGihon said the Tritons will 
need to prepare for the longer meets.

“Two meets in two days requires 
a large amount of conditioning,” 
McGihon said.

Junior Matt Herman claimed the 
first victory for the Tritons on Friday 
by winning the mile swim with a time 
of 15:56.70. The mile is an unusu-
al swim to see at a dual meet, but 
Herman still pulled out the victory. 

Freshman Emily Adamczyk also 
continued her streak of outstanding 
performances by winning the 200-
yard breast stroke (2:22.37). 

In one of the closest swims of the 
day, sophomore Olivia Martens just 
missed the victory in the 200 but-
terfly (2:08.25), falling by less than a 
tenth of a second. Both the men’s and 
women’s 400 freestyle relays emerged 
victorious at the end of the day.

Junior Alex Henley continued her 
streak with a victory both days, win-
ning the 200 backstroke (2:02.79) 
with a dominating five-second lead 
over her closest opponent. She fol-
lowed that up with a victory in the 
400 individual medley on Saturday, 
with a pool-record time of 4:25.39. 

Sophomore Shaun Stringer was 
another winner for the Tritons on 
Saturday, with a victory in the 200-
yard butterfly (1:50.40), also a pool-
record time.

The Tritons also had a couple of 
near misses on Saturday. Junior Blake 
Langland took second place in the 
50 freestyle (20.93), which would 

have been a pool record, had he not 
lost by less than half a second to 
Hawaii. Freshman See Han Lee took 
an unfortunate third place in the 200 
breast stroke (2:04.33), leading the 
race up until the last 50 yards. 

But Lorch said close races will help 
later on.

“Being as close as we are, it helps 
when it comes to big meets,” Lorch 
said. “Cheering for everybody when 
you have a tough swim.”

The Tritons will spend the next 
three weeks training for conference 
championships, and still have time to 
rest before the meet.

“Monday, we’re going to come 
back and train pretty hard,” McGihon 
said. “We still have a good amount 
of training before conference cham-
pionships.”

Clutch Shooting Gives Tritons the Edge

Daisy Feder hit a three-pointer with 14 seconds remaining to give the Tritons a 63-61 win over Humboldt 
State on Saturday night.

UCSD earned two tight road wins against Sonoma State and 
Humboldt State over the weekend. 

After two disappointing losses at home last week, the UCSD women’s basketball team regrouped to pull out two more wins on the 
road. The Tritons improved to 10-4 in conference 
after a 58-54 win against Sonoma State on Thursday 
and a 63-61 victory against CCAA rival Humboldt 
State on Saturday. 

“This was a huge weekend for us,” head coach 
Charity Elliott said. “This is one of the toughest 
trips in the CCAA, and to come out with two wins 
shows how far this team has progressed.”

The Tritons found themselves in a low-scoring 
bout on Thursday against the Seawolves. Junior 
and sophomore guards Chelsea Carlisle and Emily 
Osga did the bulk of the work on the offensive end, 
leading all scorers with 19 points apiece while also  
grabbing nine rebounds each. 

The Tritons went 10-of-23 in the opening peri-
od to go up early, shooting a solid 42 percent 
from the field as opposed to 
the Seawolves’ paltry 29 percent.  
UCSD led by as many as 10 
points in the first half, despite 
good shooting from Sonoma 
forward Aly Henington, who 
led the Seawolves in scoring 
with 15 points on the night.

Sonoma forward Taylor Vigil 
also put away 10 points, while 
center Aly Conway chipped in 
for nine points and 15 boards.

UCSD carried the lead into 
the second half, until a three-
pointer from Henington with 
11:13 minutes remaining put 
the Seawolves up 43-41. From 

there, the Tritons clamped down on defense, keep-
ing Sonoma scoreless for the next 9:49. The Tritons 
went on an 11-0 run, and held on for the 58-54 
win despite two last-minute three-pointers from 
Sonoma guard Roxanne Rentschler.  

The Tritons finished their road trip with a 
come-from-behind 63-61 victory over Northern 
California rival Humboldt State on Saturday.

With 30 seconds remaining, UCSD trailed the 
Lumberjacks by one point. Guard Daisy Feder came 
through in the clutch, as the junior sharpshooter 
drained her third three-pointer of the night to lift 
the Tritons to their 10th win of their last 13 games.  

Feder finished the night with 11 points, while 
Carlisle — who averages over 18 points a game — 
was limited to just nine points on the night. Junior 
forward Lauren Freidenberg picked up the slack, 
recording her second double-double in her last 
three games, scoring a game-high 20 points and 17 

rebounds.  
“Lauren Freidenberg and 

Daisy Feder had huge games 
at Humboldt, hitting some big 
shots down the stretch,” Elliott 
said. “Humboldt was double 
teaming Chelsea [Carlisle] most 
of the night, and Chelsea did 
a great job of finding an open 
teammate. And they answered 
by hitting some big baskets.” 

The game was tight for the 
entire 40 minutes, with the 
lead changing hands 13 times 
throughout.

Tritons Split Matches With No. 11 Hawaii

By Hanna Rahimi
Staff Writer

MEN’S VOLLEYBALL — The UCSD men’s volleyball 
team played a pair of matches against the University of 
Hawaii on Friday and Saturday, winning the first in five 
sets before losing 3-1 on Saturday.

Friday’s match showed scores of 25-23, 16-25, 20-25, 
25-23 and 15-8. UCSD was outhit .266 against Hawaii’s 
.325, but managed to hang on for the win in the first 
five-set game of the season. 

The sets were tight throughout, showing 14 and 
16 tie scores in games one and four, respectively. The 
fourth game had eight lead changes, but the Tritons 
only let the Warriors get one tie score in game five and 
never trailed, clenching the victory for UCSD. 

“Coming out of a couple of time outs and even 
after the loss in game two, we were talking confidence, 
confidence,” head coach Kevin Ring said. “It’s our gym 
— let’s go defend it.  And I really felt like the guys did 
that. We kept our composure, kept our heads up, and 
kept fighting it.”

Senior middle blocker Calvin Ross led the Tritons 

with a career-high 17 kills and just two errors in 26 
attacks.

“This was one of the best matches Calvin has ever 
played,” Ring said. “I was really impressed with what he 
did ending game four. We had six kills from the middle 
game five and that’s huge.” 

Five of those six kills came from Ross.
“It was the sets from Phil [Bannan],” Ross said. “Phil 

was just setting it up for me perfectly. The passes and 
everything, it worked out what we did as a team, not 
just what I was doing. Guys came off the bench and 
played better than I’ve seen them play in a long time.”

Sophomore outside hitter Carl Eberts had 13 kills, 
nine digs, three assists, three blocks and a service ace. 
Phil Bannan collected another 32 assists, nine kills, 
four digs, two blocks and an ace, and fellow setter 
freshman Mike Brunsting showed 26 assists, eight kills, 
eight digs, two blocks and two aces.

“It shows a lot of confidence and ability of our pass-
ers to be in system and ability of our setters to have 
the confidence in that moment to set those guys,” 

TRITONS CONTINUE TO 
STRUGGLE ON THE ROAD

MEN’S BASKETBALL — Following 
blowout losses to Sonoma State 
and conference leader Humboldt 
State, the UCSD men’s basketball 
team continued its slide over the 
weekend. The Tritons were crushed 
83-60 on Thursday night before 
Humboldt stifled the Triton offense 
for a 69-44 win. 

The Tritons had a rough game 
defensively against Sonoma, as the 
Seawolves had five players in double 
figures and shot 51 percent from 
the floor. Ben Washington had 18 
points, James Sandoval added 16 
more and the home team handed 

the Tritons their worst loss of the 
season.

The Seawolves have the second-
best offense in the conference, and 
showed why in the second half as 
they outscored the Tritons 45-31.

The lone bright spot for the 
Tritons was center Christian Hatch, 
who had a double-double with 
10 rebounds and a game-high 19 
points. No other Triton scored in 

double figures, and the Tritons had 
17 turnovers that turned into 22 
Sonoma points.

The Tritons had their worst offen-
sive game of the season Saturday 
night at Humboldt State as they shot 
a paltry 29 percent from the floor. 
UCSD trailed by just five points at 
the half, but was outscored 42-22 
in the second period as Humboldt 
pulled away. 

Hatch and sophomore forward 
Justin Brue went 2-19 from the field, 
and the Tritons could not keep pace 
with the Lumberjacks, who shot 53 
percent on the game. The Tritons 
were also out-rebounded 39-27.

Randy Hunter led the 
Lumberjacks with a game-high 17 
points and eight rebounds. Casey 
Ryan had 12 points and six rebounds 
for the Tritons, while James McCann 
added 10 points.

UCSD now has lost five straight 
games, and seven out of the last 
eight. The Tritons entered the week-
end in a tie for eighth place and the 
final CCAA Tournament bid, but 
moved down to 10th place with the 
losses. Humboldt moved into a tie 
atop the conference standings with 
the win. 

The Tritons are now 9-11 overall 
and 4-10 in conference play. UCSD 
is just 1-7 in conference road games 
this season, but enters into a four-
game home stand this week. The 
Tritons will face San Francisco State 
on Thursday before hosting Cal 
State Monterey Bay on Spirit Night 
on Saturday. Both games will tip off 
at 7:30 p.m.

WEEKEND ANALYSIS

After a series of close losses, the 
Tritons were trounced twice 
this weekend. Yes, their oppo-
nents were two of the best in 
the conference, but the Tritons’ 
problems on both sides of the 
ball (76.0 ppg allowed, shoot-
ing below 40 percent in the last 
three games) do not bode well 
for their chances of making the 
conference tournament. 

WEEKEND ANALYSIS

It certainly wasn’t pretty, but 
the Tritons got the job done 
against Sonoma and Humboldt 
to help ease the pain of two 
disappointing losses last week-
end. Daisy Feder proved once 
again that she is deadly from 
behind the arc, and the Tritons 
scored a moral victory by end-
ing a three-game skid against 
Humboldt — the team that 
ended the Tritons’ season last 
year.
