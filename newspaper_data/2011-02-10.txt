Molecular biology professor Milton 
Saier is seeking a neutral third party to 
mediate what he believes was the unfair and 
sudden closure of his lab due to personnel 
issues. Saiers lab was closed by the biological 
sciences division, citing safety violations, 
over winter break. 

Saier said the biological sciences 
division closed his computer and research 
lab without warning, cancelled approved 
BISP 199 applications for Winter Quarter 
2011 and expelled all lab volunteers, though 
the department later placed a limit on the 
number of students allowed.

Environmental Health and Safety 
specialist Sarah Gordon conducted a routine 
lab audit on Dec. 1 and reported that there 
were five minor violations. These violations 
included contaminated liquid media, 
chemical supplies or equipment that was not 
stored in an earthquake-proof manner and 
lab materials blocking an exit.

None of them sound like egregious 
offenses, Saier said. This was a normal 
report.

On Dec. 15, Saier found out his lab had 
been closed, effective immediately, from a 
posted sign. Later on, he found a letter on 
his desk from biological sciences dean Steve 
Kay notifying him of the labs closure and 
received notice via e-mail from the biological 
sciences associate dean Richard Firtel.

I received no prior notification, Saier 
said. I received no opportunity to explain 
the situation. They did not tell us anything 
until after closure. As far as I know of, this is 
unprecedented. Nobody that I know of has 
ever been shut down in a similar way. Locks 
were changed. 

According to Saier, EH&S said the lab 
was closed due to two concerns.

One was that they were concerned

Graduate Student Association representative 
Garo Bournoutian and Sixth College Senator 
Parminder Sandhu have created a resolution 
against a $6-per-unit quarterly tech fee proposed 
by Academic & Computing Media Services 
department.

 The fee, originally proposed on Dec. 1,  was 
originaly planned to be $5 per unit, but was later 
changed to $6 per unit. � Currently, there is no 
technology fee at UCSD, and ACMS officials are 
concerned about outdated technologies. �

The $6 figure is based on existing fees at other 
UC schools and how much the department wants 
to spend on improving classroom technology. 
Revenue would fund technology improvements 
for courses, except for the 29 percent that will 
return to financial aid.

A.S. councilmembers have raised concerns as 
to whether the money will go to the right places, as 
the proposal does not specify where funds will go.

We cannot support any new fees unless we 
have the opportunity to vote and are given a 

specific budget detailing the exact distribution of 
student fees, A.S. President Wafa Ben Hassine 
said.

The final say on the fee rests with Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox, but many groups, including 
staff, fee committees and the council have or 
will review the proposal and present opinions to 
Fox. The fee could see the Chancellors desk by 
February and could be in place as soon as Fall 
Quarter 2011.

Ben Hassine and other members of A.S. 
Council have expressed their disapproval of 
the fee. On Jan. 24, they issued a statement to 
administrators stating their opposition to it.

The audacity to administer a new fee given 
the current student financial condition, the lack of 
statistics to justify the technological changes and 
a lack of student representation in the drafting of 
the proposal, Ben Hassine said in the statement.

She also expressed concern of the precedent 
the fee would set without student approval.

 Students and faculty share the concern that 
if this proposal passes, it will inevitably lead to the 
implementation of more fees through methods 
that lack student representation, Ben Hassine said. 

Recently, a few councilmembers said they were 
confident that Fox would reject the fee proposal

The fee would cost a student taking 16 units 
a quarter an additional $288 per year, in addition 
to the approximate 40-percent increase in fees 
students have witnessed in the past two years.

The fee would improve the technology in 
classrooms by adding new projectors, expanding 
podcasting capabilities, adding document readers 
and improving WiFi service. Some money would 
also go to remote access labs, expanding WebCT 
and keeping libraries open later. The allocation 
of fee money is mostly based on expansion of the 
current systems, rather than a total overhaul.

The proposal also provides for the creation of 
an Instructional Technology Vision & Funding 
Committee. This committee would consist of 
staff, administrators and three students (two 
undergraduate and one graduate). The committee 
whose role it would be to decide how revenue is 
spent will only be created if the fee is passed.

ACMS could not be reached for comment

A proposal is currently in the works to have Greek housing 
built along La Jolla Shores Drive, southwest of Revelle College.

I want to change the stigma about the Greek community, 
Greek Housing Initiative Committee Chair Michael Raimondi 
said. You have members in your chapter who are involved on 
campus who are actively bettering the community. All of these 
positive things are occurring on a daily basis and they arent being 
actively advertised.

The committee has set three phases for the proposal: Phase one 
establishes Greek housing while phase two and three add student 
organizations and sports teams to the housing community. 

Housing will be opened up to all student leaders, Raimondi 
said. Their organization may not have alphabetic letters across 
their chests but theyre still a community ... We have 23,000 
students who all care about 23,000 different things and form 

groups  they should be allowed off-campus housing as well.
According to Raimondi, each chapter interested in a house 

would be able to receive one under the proposal. Housing 
payments would be similar to the dorms, where students pay 
for their room and not for the entire house. The chapters would 
decide which amenities will be included

The proposed area along La Jolla Shores Drive is six to eight 
acres, but housing would take up two to three acres for the project. 
As of yet, there is no visual representation. Raimondi hopes to 
create a housing community that best accommodates student life 
at UCSD. There are currently no estimates of the total cost.

After receiving student input from Panhellenic Association 
and Interfraternity Council, which Raimondi said were supportive 
of the initiative, the committee decided to draft the proposal.

USC, Berkeley and UCLA all have Greek housing and each of 
those schools have a very fun social scene, Kappa Kappa Gamma 
member Sarah Tehrani said. In fact, I think if this school had 
Greek housing, it would make the Greek system less exclusive 

and also more accessible.
Raimondi will soliciting opinions to see what the Greek 

community wants on paper. He will be visiting college councils, 
provosts and deans to discuss how Greek members can help the 
colleges lessen the stress of meeting on-campus housing demands.

Raimondi has been discussing the idea with several 
administrators, including Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Penny Rue, and said they have been receiving positive feedback.

This hasnt been brought up to the administration from a 
student perspective from a formal level before, that I know of, 
Raimondi said.

Raimondi said the administrators opinions have changed 
dramatically since last spring. 

The university is listening and they are on board, Raimondi 
said.

The committee will research costs and funding source once 

Come April, students may be asked to vote on a new fee increase. On Feb. 2, University Centers Advisory Board 
Chair Nicole Metildi presented a referendum 
to A.S. Council that, if passed, would raise 
the University Centers Fee by $5 to $81.50 
per quarter, and be adjusted annually by the 
Consumer Price Index.

The Student Center Fee was renamed the 
University Center Fee in 1984, when Price 
Center West was built. It now supports Price 
Center East and West, as well as the Student 
Center and the Che CafØ complex, by funding 
maintenance, repairs and operation costs. 

UCSD spent $49, 980 in 2010 to commission a 
Facilities Condition Analysis to provide an account 
of predicted expenditures as well as estimates for 
long-term planning purposes. The study revealed 
that, in the next 10 years, Price Center will require

ResearchersÊFindÊGeneticÊCluesÊforÊRareÊChildhoodÊDisorder

Researchers have discovered a gene 
that, when mutated, causes cognitive 
and behavioral defects seen in Lesch-
Nyhan disease, a rare neurological 
disease that affects children. 

“We understand how this gene 
affects normal brain function, and that 
is a new facet to this disease,” pediatrics 
professor Theodore Friedmann said.

The gene mutations can cause 
defects in two signaling pathways, 
which have also been associated with 

other neurodegenerative diseases like 
Alzheimer’s disease.

“We’d like to think that the clues 
we are getting from this disease may 
be telling us something about how the 
brain becomes deregulated or upset in 
other diseases,” Friedmann said.

Lesch-Nyhan disease is a disorder 
caused by a deficiency in the HGPRT 
enzyme. This is caused by mutations in 
the HPRT gene on the X chromosome, 
which leads to a build-up of uric acid in 
bodily fluids and damages neurological 
pathways. 

The HPRT gene is expressed in 
most healthy cells and was previously 
thought to regulate metabolism, rather 
than embryonic and neurological 
development. However, in 2009, 
Friedmann’s team found that HPRT 
plays an important role in regulating 
developmental pathways.

LND affects mainly children, 
causing cognitive and behavioral 
deficiencies like uncontrollable and 
involuntary compulsive self-mutilating 
behaviors, like lip- and- finger-biting.

The research team discovered a 

similarity in the genes to those related 
to other neurological disorders, 
like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and 
Huntington’s disease. Studying the 
common mechanisms defective in 
LND can tell researchers how it works 
in more common diseases such as 
Parkinson’s.

“We’ve been working with this 
disease for forty years,” Friedmann said. 
“[Until this study] came along, we had 
no clue about how genetic defects cause 
brain defects.” 

Friedmann and his team 
also identified abnormal purine 
metabolism in LND patients caused 
defects in the PS-1 and Wnt pathways. 
The interactions between these two 
pathways suggest they are associated 
with other neurodegenerative diseases.

Lesch-Nyhan disease affects one in 
100,000 children. Researchers hope to 
identify treatments, as there currently 
are none. Since they know which genes 
are interfering, Friedmann said gene 
therapy or design drugs are possible to 
target the secondary defects as a result 
of the mutation.

“This is a very complicated 
mechanism,” Friedmann said. “A single 
gene leads to a string of secondary 
defects — these are the targets for 
treatment.”

Using this model, researchers can 
also extend treatments to adults with 
neurological diseases. Their goal is to 
correct defects caused by LND.

that there might be safety violations 
[and] students would be in an unsafe 
environment,” Saier said. “The other 
was because I always have taken a large 
number of undergraduate students ... 
They were concerned that I was taking 
more students than we could mentor.”

Kay could not be reached directly. 
UCSD Science Communications 
Director Kim McDonald released the 
following statement. 

“The safety of students within our 
campus laboratories is of paramount 

concern for the Division of Biological 
Sciences. We take seriously our 
responsibility for ensuring a safe 
working environment in all of our 
laboratories. We also want to make 
sure our students are working in a 
laboratory environment.”

McDonald was unable to comment 
on Saier’s case. 

“Though we cannot discuss the 
specific details of this case, some 
safety concerns were identified by the 
Division and therefore, as a precaution, 
the laboratory was temporarily closed...”

On Dec. 16, EH&S conducted a 
second inspection without notifying 
Saier. According to Saier, compared 
to a typical 30-minute inspection, the 
second one took two hours and no 
members were present to clarify lab 
conditions.

“A second, much more intensive 
audit was conducted, where every 
drawer was opened and examined and 
every shelf was scrutinized,” Saier said. 
“No member of our lab was allowed in.”

The next day, Saier received reports 
for both the Dec. 1 and Dec. 16 

inspections. 
“The contrast was dramatic, even 

though there had been only a two-week 
lapse and there had been no essential 
changes,” Saier said. “The first one was 
conducted in the usual way [while] the 
second one was conducted with a fine-
toothed comb.”

In the first report, there were only 
five minor violations. The second 
report had 27.

As our campus celebrates Black History Month at UC San Diego, it is a time for 
us to re�ect on our Principles of Community and our campus climate.  I am 
grateful to the many campus partners (students, faculty, sta�, and alumni) who 
provide leadership for Black History Month and create space at UC San Diego 
to learn and discuss African-American history and culture in America.

Our campus is determined to make meaningful change in the area of inclusive 
excellence.  Members of the campus community--students, faculty, and sta� 
alike-- have embarked on a series of action items to improve campus climate 
and enhance the diversity of UC San Diego.   As we continue to address issues 
of inclusion and diversity, it is important to remember that meaningful change 
involves each of us and is an ongoing process.  I encourage you to review the 
Campus Climate website to learn about the progress the university has made 
in meeting the common goals set forth by the students, faculty and adminis-
tration.  You can access the website at http://campusclimate.ucsd.edu.  

Please consider what you, as a member of our campus community, can do to 
help our campus become more welcoming, equitable, and inclusive.  I also 
encourage you to participate in several of the rich events planned for Black 
History Month.  For more information on these activities, please visit 
http://provost.ucsd.edu/blackhistorymonth/.   Please join us in helping us to 
live out our Principles of Community here at UC San Diego.

During public input, Vice 
President External of the Muslim 
Student Association Eyad Alnaslah 
asked council to show support 
for recent discrimination against 
Muslim students. 
Islam Awareness 
Week is next 
week and fliers 
have been 
defaced or torn 
down. The MSA 
have received 
hate e-mails, 
phone calls and text messages. One 
MSA member resigned because of 
threatening phone calls and text 
messages.

Sixth College Senator Parminder 
Sandhu stepped up during public 
input to talk about Relay for Life, 
which starts April 16. He was 
reprimanded by Council Speaker 
Meredith Madnick for not waiting 
until open forum to address the 
issue.

Sixth College Senator Kristian 
Castro gave a presentation about 
the campaign for the California 
D.R.E.A.M. Act, which gives 
qualifying undocumented students 
the chance to receive the financial 
aid they already contribute through 
tuition. The campaign is sending 
postcards to state government, and 
the campus’s goal is to send 1,000 
postcards.

Warren College Senator Kevin 
Hoang was at a campus budget 
meeting, which CLICS is likely to 
close due to budget cuts.

AVP of Athletic Recreations 
Pauline Nuth said she is reinstating 
the basketball game prize cards, 
which means more opportunities for 
free swag.

AVP of Concerts and Events 
Brian Wong said the first Bear 
Garden of the quarter is this Friday 

at Matthews Quad. VP of Finance 
and Resources Andrew Ang said 
Triton Outfitters will debut in an 
“awesome blue tent” at the event.

Campuswide Senator Anish 
Bhayani gave a 
presentation on 
a possible $92 
quarterly fee 
for using sports 
facilities, such 
as Canyon View 
Pool. He also 
presented the 

changes he wanted to make to the or 
the Athletics Recreation and Sports 
Facilities Advisory Board charter. 
The current charter, which is not yet 
approved by council but has been by 
the Graduate Student Association, 
changes the name of the advisory 
board and the percentage of students 
on the board to 80 percent. Bhayani 
feels that student control on the 
board is inadequate because they do 
not have the final vote, the director 
of Sports Facilities only considers 
board’s input.

The cast of the Vagina 
Monologues requested $400 from 
council. The amount was heavily 
debated, because the event has 
had a set budget of $4,500 since 
the beginning of the school year. 
President Wafa Ben Hassine said it 
was irresponsible for them to go over 
the budget. Most of council agreed 
and thus, did not provide additional 
funds. 

This week’s meeting felt like 
it was two hours longer than it 
actually was. It ended on a slightly 
somber note with a message from 
Ben Hassine, who urged council to 
support Islam Awareness Week. 

AVP of College Affairs Leonard 
Bobbitt lifted councilmembers’ 
spirits in the end, by demonstrating 
his ability to lick his neck.

maintain while the Student Center 
and Che Café require $2.6 million and 
$722,000, respectively.

“There were astronomical costs 
predicted in the next decade or so that 
we are going to have to pay, so all of 
these fees are pretty necessary,” Metildi 
said. “If we don’t increase our reserves, 
we’re going to go into the red.”

According to University Centers 
Director Paul Terzino, the UCEN 
budget of over $10 million will go into 
a deficit of $108,516 by 2015 unless 
there is financial assistance. Inflation 
has caused the costs associated with 
maintenance and operation to escalate, 
while the fee has stayed steady since 
2003. Stabilizing enrollment figures 
have also exacerbated decreased 
revenue, as fixed enrollment numbers 
do not provide increased revenue.

Additionally, the reserve funds 
of about $3 million will deplete to 
zero in 2015 if no change is made. 
Reserves fund repair and replacement 
projects, like keeping equipment up to 
date and preventing facility resources 
from deteriorating. The increase in 
the facilities fee will maintain current 
maintenance standards.

The quarterly facilities fee — 
currently $76.50 — would be subject 
to a five-dollar increase as well as 
the annual Consumer Price Index 
adjustment, and would close the gap 
currently leading to deficits in the 
University Centers budget.

The referendum’s Consumer Price 
Index adjustment, which varies by year 
and is generally under 5 percent, will 

keep the revenues in line with inflation 
rates — making it easier to maintain 
facilities and operations when prices 
rise or fall overall. The CPI adjustment 
is now used to annually adjust the A.S. 
Activity fee, the RIMAC fee and the 
Intercollegiate Athletic fee.

“This referendum takes care of our 
needs for a long time,” Terzino said. 
“We don’t want to have to keep coming 
back to increase it, and increasing the 
fee by the Consumer Price Index really 
helps the long term viability of the 
facilities here.”

According to Metildi’s presentation, 
if there is no fee increase, students 
will find Price Center less convenient 
since students will be charged for 
the equipment and room use, facility 
resources and spaces will deteriorate 
and hours of operation will reduce.

Terzino said they do not know if 
those effects will occur.

“We’re not panicking yet,” Terzino 
said. “I don’t have any numbers. We’ll 
raise as little as we have to ... We are 
looking into possibly charging higher 
rates for our services. We are not 
currently charging for the use of AV 
equipment, but we’ll have to start 
charging for that as well as charging 
student orgs for using meeting 
rooms.”

Currently, Price Center East is open 
24 hours a day. Terzino said such hours 
will be unsustainable without a fee 
increase. Terzino believes a 24-hour 
access is important for students. 

“There can be as many as 200 to 300 
students here at two in the morning,” 
Terzino said. “Certainly around 

midterms and finals.” 
Vendors such as Tapioca Express 

and Burger King also see significant 
business when they stay open all night.

“A lot of students go to the Price 
Center for the late-night retail and late 
night vendors,” Metildi said. “We can 
see that the students want the buildings 
to be open.”

Metildi said the fee increase has not 
had strong opposition from students.

 “The general response is pretty 
positive,” Metildi said. “I think people 
realize we’re not trying to raise it an 
enormous amount, we’re just trying to 
maintain a steady fee to cover the costs 
of maintaining the building.”

Revelle College junior Vashisht 
Madabhushi is ambivalent about the 
increase. 

“I agree with the increase in price, 
but only for Price Center,” Madabhushi 
said. “I don’t believe that the Che Cafe 
has enough student involvement to 
merit getting the money, and I am 
indifferent about the student center.”

To make it on the spring election 
ballot, A.S. Council must pass the 
referendum by a two-thirds majority. It 
must then pass in the Graduate Student 
Association with a two-thirds majority. 

If the proposal appears on the ballot

One of the biggest miscon-ceptions about going Greek is the idea that you’re pay-
ing for friends. 

The paying part is true: To be a 
part of a fraternity or sorority, there’s 
the requisite dues, which range 
from $100 to $600 a quarter — the 
cost depends on your chapter and 
what the chapter uses the money for 
(trips, events, T-shirts and recruit-
ment). It’s a pretty hefty chunk of 
change, but after being a sorority 
member for a quarter, I know that 
you aren’t paying for anyone to 
hang out with you. You’re paying for 
events planning and to do things you 
otherwise wouldn’t do.

The transition from not being 
affiliated to being a part of Greek life 
is similar to the transition from pub-
lic to private school. Having attended 
both, the best things about public 
school are that there are more people 
and fewer restrictions, from what 
one can wear to what she can do and 
say. This freedom comes at the low, 
low price of: nothing! 

The freedom is sort of what it’s 
like to not be in the Greek system 
at UCSD: You control where your 
money goes and aren’t required to 
uphold a certain image. 

Greek life is more like private 
school, but there’s more to it than 
just rules and tuition. A private sys-
tem can offer a smaller, tight-knit 
community that makes it easier to 
build relationships and make con-
nections. As a part of a sorority, new 
job and internship opportunities are 
open to me. 

For example, whenever a girl is 
leaving an internship, she’ll open the 
position to her sisters before the job 
is posted on Port Triton. I’ve heard 
countless anecdotes about employers 
displaying preference for a candidate 
because she was part of the same fra-
ternity or sorority. 

To be able to go to an enormous 
public school and also be a part of a 
smaller community that knows you 
as more than another cog in the sys-
tem is really the best of both worlds. 

One girl pointed out that she 
could find better ways to spend her 
money every quarter doing what she 
wanted to do, rather than having the 
sorority spend it for her. And while 
that may be true, without the soror-
ity I wouldn’t have done much with 
my money anyway. 

So, having a sorority plan events 
for my friends and me is a gift 
that keeps me from staying in and 
watching “Top Model” reruns. My 
first quarter of being in a sorority, 
I learned how to play football and 
salsa dance, competed in a tug-a-war 
competition (harder than it looks — 
trust me) and relived my youth as I 
darted between the different bounce 
houses at Pump It Up. 

I’ve learned that going Greek 
is not paying for friends: It’s about 
paying to do things with friends. I’m 
happy to try new things with my 
sisters, I’m happy that there’s always 
something to do when I need a study 
break and, most of all, I’m happy 
that I get a senior prom re-do every 
quarter — and, this time around, 
without the awkward science teacher 
in the corner.

The administration shut down biology professor Milton Saier’s lab for 
“personnel” issues, but turns out it’s the students that are 

taking the hardest hit.

The case of the biology department shutting professor Milton Saier’s lab reads like a police novel. Saier — known for being a liberal 
unafraid to speak his mind or disagree with admin-
istrators — alleges that his lab was closed due to per-
sonal problems and age discrmination. The depart-
ment cites safety violations. But admist the squabble, 
the real victims are the students whose labwork and 
education has been disrupted. 

Just before break, Saier’s lab was subjected to the 
first of two unannounced lap inspections. The first, 
a routine inspection, yielded five violations. The 
second — conducted just two weeks later in much 
greater detail, and without notification or inquiry 
and without assistance from lab members, as is stan-
dard practice — yielded 27 violations.

The Environmental, Health and Safety office 
said the lab closure was due to safety violations and 
the fact that Saier — who’s known to take on more 
undergrad researchers than his peers — had accepted 
too many students to his lab.

But Saier says he believes the lab was closed due 

to the personal biases of biological sciences associate 
dean Richard Firtel rather than actual safety viola-
tions If Saier’s allegations are true, his lab shut-down 
would be a violation of university policy.

Saier also cites his age as a motive for his lab 
closure. According to Saier, several faculty members 
have seen enough discrimination against aging pro-
fessors that they generalize the behavior. Four years 
beyond the retirement age, though, Saier said he’s not 
planning to give up his mantle anytime soon.  

Though we can’t say for sure that the lab closure 
can be attributed to petty differences among faculty 
members, it’s all too clear that it wasn’t communi-
cated properly. And while that kind of oversight can 
probably be expected in the realm of administrative 
politics, the exponential jump in violations from five 
to 27 —including violations Saier claims were repeat-
ed or added without follow-up during the second 
inspection — make it seem likely that they were used 
to force out a professor who is considered uncontrol-
lable to some administrators.

You’d think consistent fee hike protests would get the mes-sage across, but it looks like 
the man’s at it again. 

The University Centers Advisory 
Board has reintroduced to A.S. 
Council a resolution that, if passed, 
would create a $5 quarterly increase 
to the University Centers fee, raising 
it to $81.50. But university depart-
ments should look to student pock-
etbooks as the last resort, not the 
first stop in a plan to maintain the 
service of choice.

A 2010 Facilities Condition 
Analysis revealed that over the next 
10 years, the University Centers 
(Price Center, the Student Center 
and Che Café) will require an 
additional $6.4 million in general 
maintenance, repairs and operational 
costs. And according to University 
Centers Director Paul Terzino, 
the consequences of not passing a 
referendum will be dire: charging 

students and orgs for using equip-
ment and meeting rooms; facility 
resources and spaces will deteriorate; 
hours of operation will be reduced.

Terzino says UCEN needs the 
funds because UCSD has seen a 
sharp decrease in both student 
enrollment and state funding.

So, as with all other causes, the 
need is there. But it isn’t urgent— 
Terzino also notes that, without a 
fee increase, we won’t actually be in 
the red until the 2015-16 academic 
year. In addition, UCEN has $3 mil-
lion in reserves, a million more than 
Terzino says is necessary. Neither 
Terzino nor UCAB is “panicking 
yet.” In fact, they’re not panicking 
so much that UCAB hasn’t even dis-
cussed what the first cuts to PC will 
be, or specific numbers. 

Until it’s clear what, specifically, 
is at stake — which, despite claims to 
the contrary, not even Terzino seems 
to know — this board doesn’t see 

sufficient cause for alarm. 
This is hardly the first time 

in recent memory that a campus 
department has made unfounded 
threats. Last year, when the proposed 
Parking and Transportation refer-
endum was on the table, Director of 
Parking & Transportation Services 
Brian d’Autremont threatened the 
council that the Arriba and Nobel 
shuttles would be cut if the referen-
dum didn’t pass. Here we are, a year 
after the referendum’s failure, and 
the friendly blue-and-whites are still 
chugging away. 

Last year, this same UCEN fee 
was proposed, but failed when the 
Grad Student Association shot it 
down due to “bad timing.” There is, 
of course, never a good time to raise 
fees — which is why a new student 
fee should be the last resort, and 
only an option when all others have 
been exhausted. 

Instead of looking to the students 

for an annual bail-out, UCAB should 
look to its other profit-making sec-
tor: Price Center vendors. According 
to Terzino, the PC vendors are on 
10-year leases that include a base 
cost that’s already adjusted annually 
for inflation. 

Because the leases are staggered, 
every few years a new vendor will 
be up to renew theirs. At that point, 
UCAB should evaluate the opportu-
nity to raise the vendors’ rent. 

While Terzino warned that rais-
ing the rent on vendors might force 
them to raise their prices — a cost 
that will be transferred to the stu-
dents — passing a referendum will 
not raise costs only on the students 
that use PC, but on the entire cam-
pus. And in the end, we’d prefer to 
leave the costs in the hands of those 
who actually use the centers, rather 
than stick every member of the stu-
dent body with a fattened TritonLink 
bill.

JOAN OF ART By Raechel Wong

Students Shouldn’t Pay the Price for Colleagues’ Squabbles

Dear Editor,
On Feb. 3, The Guardian pub-

lished an editorial entitled “The 
Waiting Game,” which examined 
pressing problems surrounding 
continued use of the three-tier per-
mit parking system amidst a sud-
den decline in the total number of 
available spaces on campus. 

Although the article suggested 
a number of thoughtful approaches 
to alleviate parking-related conges-
tion, it failed to take complete stock 
of the matter.

The distribution of spaces was 
portrayed as “glaringly uneven,” 
with 23,000 undergraduate stu-
dents making use of 4,910 S spaces, 
“while 6,059 faculty members and 
grad students are well-provided 
for with a combined 6,003 spots,” 
consisting of both A (faculty) and B 
(staff) spaces.      

Unfortunately, faculty aside, the 
6,059 figure is a low one. Graduate 
and professional students alone 
account for around 5,200 persons. 
Missing from this appraisal was a 
complete appreciation of the size 
and diverse variety of B permit 
users, including postdoctoral 
researchers, medical residents, 
career staff members and other 
groups. 

Surely the investigative staff 
of the Guardian did not seri-
ously believe that the balance of the 

university community somehow 
spontaneously materialized at their 
places of work. 
     At a later point, the article 
insisted “...there are dozens of 
unoccupied graduate student park-
ing spaces on any given day of the 
week in the East Regents lots near 
Triton Ballpark.” Presumably by 
“graduate student parking spaces,” 
the editorial board of the Guardian
intended to call attention to the 
number of vacant B spaces that, as 
I commented earlier, are not the 
exclusive domain of graduate stu-
dents. 
     At stake in this matter is the fact 
that the campus parking policy in 
particular, and the campus trans-
portation policy more generally, are 
in dire need of a wholesale re-plan-
ning. It would be unfair to scape-
goat graduate students as the cause 
of the problem.

VP of Internal Affairs, UCSD

Guardian Parking Article 
Too Narrow-Minded

WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

Firtel has said that the biology 
department does not have confi-
dence in Saier and UCSD Science 
Communications 
director Kim 
McDonald cited 
“safety and quality 
of education” as the 
underlying reasons for 
closure of Saier’s lab.

But if the biology 
department were seri-
ously concerned with 
students’ quality of 
education, it wouldn’t have elimi-
nated the research opportunities 
in Saier’s lab. Following the second 
inspection on Dec. 15, all approved 
research credit applications for 

Saier’s lab were cancelled without 
notice. 

Whatever issues may exist among 
Saier and his colleagues, students 
shouldn’t be the ones to pay the 

price. One of UCSD’s 
main attractions for 
biology undergrads, 
after all, is the pos-
sibility of conducting 
research, which is a 
crucial element of the 
major. 

As a result, stu-
dents taking or plan-

ning to take the course were not able 
to start  research projects, which 
are essential for obtaining a mas-
ter’s degree or applying to graduate 
school. Up to 30 didn’t receive the 

credit they expected this quarter, 
and will have to re-apply for another 
BISP 199 course, potentially setting 
them back by up to a year.  

In addition to undergrads, gradu-
ate researchers who were already 
working on experiments had to 
cancel their projects, losing valuable 
data and disrupting time. 

Now, the lab — with less man-
power — has to get back in gear to 
return to full capacity. It’s a trou-
bling matter that could have been 
prevented all along, given clearer 
communication. While some details 
remain too murky to make definitive 
judgments, the closure of Saier’s lab 
comes at the expense of both stu-
dents and campus research. So much 
for all that safe, quality education.

It’s a troubling 
matter that 
could have been 
prevented all 
along, given clearer 
communication.

ideas of having houses is unrealistic, 
mostly because there’s no way it would 
be done before we graduate, so there’s 
no point in us worrying about this.”

Eventually, Raimondi wants to 
expand beyond the Greek community. 
Citing a complaint on a lack of strong 
community on the 2005 Undergraduate 
Student Experience and Satisfaction 
survey, Raimondi wants to create 
a campus that is interconnected 
and involved through off-campus 
community housing.

“On the other hand, Greek housing 
would really improve Greek life as it 
would cut down on drunk driving,” 
Lavi said. 

Greek advisors have shown interest.
“Greek housing would be incredibly 

beneficial for UCSD,” Alpha Epsilon 
Phi Advisor Rebecca Kilroy said. “Even 
if it was dorm-style, with different 
floors being different chapters, it would 
be something over nothing!”

Raimondi also wants to make the 
Greek system more accessible.

Raimondi said in the past, students 
attempted to create Greek housing, but 
administrators shot it down, saying it 
would not be fair to the entire student 
body unless housing for all six colleges 
was completed and they were offered 
more than one year on-campus. 

Raimondi said the committee does 
not expect the implementation of 
housing immediately. The committee’s 
goal is to get housing built by 2016.

“There is no one set mold,” 
Raimondi said. “I really think this 
could happen. If not now, when?”

redundancies,” Saier said. “[Others] reflected the fact 
that we had no one to show them where things were. 
For example, they claimed that some of the people in 
the lab had not taken the necessary health and safety 
classes. We could show we’re in the book but they 
hadn’t found it.”

The redundancies listed missing safety training 
documents and improperly labeled chemical storage 
and wastes. The second report also found a compound 
in an old container that looked yellowish brown. 

“I specifically asked them to explain every single 
violation and to point out the problems that existed,” 
Saier said. “We looked at this bottle. [But] when I 
opened the cap, it was clear that it was yellowish-
brown because the compound itself was yellowish-
brown. We weren’t there, so we weren’t allowed to 
explain everything.”

On Dec. 18, Saier said he met with EH&S research 
safety manager Kenneth Smith and found that 
although the notification stated EH&S closed the lab, 
it was due to communication with Firtel who said the 
“biology [division] does not have confidence in Saier.”

According to Saier, Kay assumed responsibility.
“[EH&S] did not initiate the closure of the lab,” 

Saier said, “but [EH&S] did approve it assuming that 
[the] biology [division] had reasons for ‘not having 
confidence in Saier.’”

Saier said his multiple attempts to reach the 
administration were met with silence.

“They wouldn’t grant me an appointment,” Saier 
said. “I couldn’t talk to them. I could communicate by 
e-mail, but frequently they wouldn’t answer.”

As many as 30 BISP 199 students were affected 
by the closure of the lab. Approved applications for 
Winter Quarter were cancelled. 

“When [the students] came in for winter quarter, 
they couldn’t start their projects, which are important 
for getting their masters or applying to graduate 
school for doing research,” Roosevelt College senior 
and lab volunteer Rostislav Castillo said. “If [BISP 199 
students] are not receiving credit for this quarter, this 
might set back some students an entire year.”

Also, other lab members, such as a research 
associate and several graduate students, could not 
continue their research. 

“Some of the ones who had experiments couldn’t 
get in, and once they couldn’t get in, they had to shut 
down their experiments,” Castillo said.

Saier said valuable data was lost in the process.
“We had to completely stop our research activities,” 

Saier said. “In addition, it meant that I could not 

mentor these students.”
As a result, Saier said research activity was low.
“No one knew if they were or weren’t allowed in, 

so most just stayed away,” Saier said. “Some of these 
students counted on doing research and were not 
allowed, so their educations were disrupted. Neither 
the students nor their professors were taken into 
account. The newly introduced regulation was more 
important than either the student or the professor.”

Shortly after meeting with Smith, the lab was 
opened to address the violations, but not for research.

“We worked very hard to do virtually everything 
to make the lab look as top-notch as possible,” Saier 
said. “We addressed every single concern of EH&S, 
took care of all problems. Ken even said we should 
dust the shelves and dust the benches, which I did. We 
bent over backwards just to do everything.”

The lab was reopened for research on Jan. 3, but 
Kay said mentors could only assist a certain number 
of students. This included a research associate, six 
graduate students and two honors undergraduate 
students. On Jan. 20, 10 undergraduates were allowed 
Previously, around 30 students worked in Saier’s lab. 

Castillo said he will not volunteer for the lab until 
he is officially registered.

“I’m going to be taking BISP 199 next quarter,” 
Rostislav said. “Until then, I’m not comfortable going 
into the lab in case something happens with the 
policy.”

Following the meeting on Jan. 18, the biology 
chairs determined that Saier could have a maximum 
of 18 students. Saier said this was a limited number, 
since there are different types of students that work in 
his lab, such as work-study students and volunteers.

“I let them know that I didn’t approve of their 
decision,” Saier said. “But, at the same time, I always 
tried to follow them. I wasn’t intentionally violating 
anything.” Since then, Saier has been working to 
restore his lab to its full pre-closure capacity.

“I’ve been working with [Kay and molecular 
biology department chair Stephen Hedrick],” Saier 
said. “It was the first time and it took over a month 
from the time of closure. I explained how our lab 
works, how we mentor students, and they came to 
accept that masters graduate students could mentor 
new incoming undergraduates. On this basis, they 
expanded the number of undergraduates I could take.”

Although the department increased the number 
of members allowed, Hedrick said if there were more 
restrictions and threatened permanent closure if there 
unauthorized students, according to Saier.

“That is language that should never be used in an 

academic setting like this,” Saier said.
Saier said he has not experienced this issue before.
“I’ve been here 38 years, and have never seen 

anything like this before,” Saier said. “We have never 
had dictatorial rule like this in the past. Never has 
there been a work-related health problem or injury 
in my lab. I see no justification for the lab closure 
that Rick ordered. At best, it was based on incomplete 
information without documentation, certainly not 
the policy of someone objective and competent.”

Now, Saier is trying to resume research activity.
“It may be a year or more before we are again 

functioning at full capacity and before students are 
able to get the educations they want,” Saier said.

Saier said he is more concerned about the impact 
on students than his own research.

“Research activity has been almost zero in my 
lab since this happened,” Saier said. “There are lots 
of unhappy students and researchers. And I’m very 
unhappy too. But the costs are far greater than just the 
research. It’s the students’ education — many students 
came to UCSD so they can be involved in research 
and they’re being prevented.”

Saier said there are several reasons he did not 
receive proper notification.

“Rick Firtel and I have never gotten along,” Saier 
said. “There’s been this quiet animosity. Second, 
I’m 69. I’ve been told by other faculty that as soon 
as you turn 65, they tend to act in ways that will 
[make you] want to retire. I have no intention of 
retiring.”

Saier also cited his temporary lack of grants, as 
he did not receive research funds from the National 
Institutes of Health. However, after submitting a 
rebuttal for the grant within a six-month span, he 
received a grant that will last for four years.

“About six to seven months ago my grant wasn’t 
funded,” Saier said. “It’s against university policy to 
try to force a person out because they don’t have 
grants. But I think that’s what happened.”

Saier said his next step is to speak with a 
university mediator this week. 

“[They] will advise me as to who should deal with 
the issues of academic freedom and harassment,” 
Saier said. “[Professors are] guaranteed by the 
academic freedom rights that we can conduct 
research and do our teaching as we see fit. If there 
is to be a review, it is to be conducted by the body of 
the faculty, not by a specific administrator.”

INTERVIEW

T alking about the insignificance of the Grammy Awards is kind of like mak-ing fun of Nicolas Cage; its awfulness 
is so universally acknowledged that there’s 
really no point to it at all. Nonetheless, it’s 
still strange that a once-respected music 
industry institution has fallen so far. A 
Grammy used to be the greatest honor in 
music; now it’s standard Cribs décor. 

Regardless, the Grammys are this 
upcoming Sunday, and I bet that you 
won’t be watching. Here’s why:

1. The confusing eligibility period 
leaves out deserving artists

The category: “Album of the Year.” The 
nominees: Arcade Fire, Eminem, Lady 
Antebellum, Lady Gaga and Katy Perry. 
I’m going to ignore the fact that I disagree 
with three-fifths of the nominees (I love 
me some Lady Gaga and Arcade Fire). 
But why the hell is Gaga nominated for 
an album (The Fame Monster) that came 
out in November of 2009? And, more 
importantly, why is the album that was 
obviously the favorite of the year — Kanye 
West’s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy 
— not included at all? Kanye’s only nomi-
nation is for summertime single, “Power” 
(for “Best Rap Solo Performance”).

The perpetrator? The awards show’s 
absurd eligibility period. Any album 
that’s released in October or later does 
not qualify for the year it actually came 
out, but instead gets included in the fol-
lowing year’s ceremony. For a category 
called “Album of the Year,” you’d think the 
qualifications would be a lot simpler (the 
Oscars handle January to December just 
fine). Maybe if the Grammys changed the 
eligibility period, they could finally keep 
up with the fast pace in which we con-
sume music. Maybe the top award would 
even be halfway relevant.

2. New artists aren’t new
While “Best New Artist” nominees 

Justin Bieber, Drake, Mumford and Sons 
and Esperanza Spalding all had their 
debut LPs come out during the eligibil-
ity period, Florence and the Machine’s 
Lungs came out in July 2009. Here, the 
Grammys have taken their obtuse rules 
and bent them even further. Florence 
is no new artist — even if your recent 
discovery of the singer through the “Eat 
Pray Love” soundtrack had you thinking 
otherwise. 

3. Album sales beat critics
I get it — people hate critics. Most are 

elitist music snobs. And I’d agree that the 
populist tendencies of the Grammys to 
favor album sales and public appeal over 
year-end lists is totally admirable. But 
shit, you’ve got to have some standards! 
So many great albums are left out, while 
even more mediocre ones are awarded 
(the Black Eyed Peas have won six 
Grammys. Seriously.). Katy Perry, an art-
ist more indebted to her singles than her 
LPs as a whole, is nominated for the big 
award, while Big Boi’s brilliant Sir Lucious 
Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty was 
even left out of the rap category.

Grammy voters seem to go so far 
out of their way to create an appeal-
ingly diverse show that they stray from 
the whole point of their endeavor: to 
acknowledge the best music of the year. 

So if you want to listen to some over-
drawn performances and watch Arcade 
Fire lose Album of the Year to Eminem, 
go ahead — watch the Grammys. The 
spectacle might be entertaining. But then 
again, you also may have just as much 
fun admiring whatever monstrosity Lady 
Gaga shows up in on Perez Hilton. Take 
your pick.

CHANNING TATUM ON THE ACTION 
FLICK THAT REQUIRES A HEAVY 
READING LOAD . . . AND SWORDS. 
BY MARGARET YAU - 
SENIOR STAFF WRITER

O
ver the years, Channing Tatum (“Dear John,” “G.I. 
Joe”) has turned into Hollywood’s go-to for troubled-
but-hunky soldiers. His newest film,“The Eagle,” isn’t 
much different — albeit a period drama, it features 
Tatum in his fourth combat role, once again playing a 

soldier on a mission. 
         Though Tatum is no stranger to tough roles, he said his turn 
as Marcus Aquila brought new challenges. 
          “[Dear John] is more of a love story, more about love, not just 
soldiering,” Tatum said. “It’s just more about a love story, unrequited 
love, regret. G.I. Joe, he’s not even really a soldier; it’s like a super-
hero, like X-Men or something. It was more sci-fi and creepy, lasers 
and crap. And now [“The Eagle”], fighting with swords and stuff.”

Before “The Eagle” even began shooting, Tatum took a crash 
course on all things Roman, spanning everything from chariot races 
to hand-to-hand combat — not that he’s new to fighting.

“I did martial arts when I was young,” Tatum said. “I practiced 
when I was nine to 13, but then I took a break, because I moved 
into sports. But I have picked up martial arts in the last couple of 

FILMREVIEW

L et’s ignore that the premise (let alone title) of this film sounds like a non-
sequitur coughed through 
a haze of marijuana smoke 
by a giggling teenager in his 

parents’ base-
ment. There’s 
a rationale here 
somewhere. This 
is, after all, an 
animated movie 
for children, so 
we should be 
quick to forgive 

an incoherent plot for a little heart 
and imagination.

A One-Edged
Sword

I n “The Eagle” Kevin MacDonald (“The Last King of Scotland”), directs a narrative about Marcus Aquila Flavius, a morose, hard-nosed Roman 
soldier (pretty boy Channing Tatum) as he searches 
in vain for the golden eagle of Rome  — and a viable 
plot.

Marcus is introduced as the son of the Roman 
military commander who led 5,000 men and a 

golden eagle totem into the backwoods of northern England, never 
to be seen again. The shame and notoriety of his father’s mistake — 
losing the prized eagle, the sign of Rome — constantly haunts him. 
Guilt-ridden, Marcus is driven to take a position as a commander in

years. So I had messed around 
with swords a little bit — 
that wasn’t too new for me. 
Horseback riding wasn’t too 
new for me either. I’ve been 
around horses pretty much my 
entire life.”

The actor was originally 
drawn to the project because 
of director Kevin MacDonald’s 
(“Last King of Scotland,” “State 
of Play”) involvement. Once 
locked in, he discovered that 
MacDonald keeps his cast’s 
nose to the grindstone — for 
Tatum, a typical day on set 
could last 13 hours. Because 
the film was shot in Europe 
(mostly in Scotland and 
Bulgaria), the cast and crew 

followed the European custom 
of a “running lunch”— mean-
ing no lunch breaks. 

“Sometimes, you’re tired in 
the morning,” Tatum said, “and 
you have to be up and awake, 
and ready to rock, so you start 
a battle scene at 6 a.m. in the 
morning, tired and kind of 
sleepy, and someone comes 
swinging an axe at your head, 
and you’re kind of like, ‘Wake 
up, black coffee, a lot of green 
tea.’”

Though “The Eagle” is 
based on a novel of the same 
name by Rosemary Sutcliff, 
Tatum said MacDonald didn’t 
want the cast to read it. 

“They had changed it pretty 
significantly,” Tatum said. “I 

think they are known to be 
more young adult-type novels 
and not so historically based 
in fact or written for older 
people.” 

Instead, MacDonald urged 
the cast to read a journal kept 
by an emperor during one of 
his war campaigns. This first-
hand account provided insight 
into how taxing such a journey 
was. It also inspired a heated 
argument on a very impor-
tant topic: how to pronounce 
Tatum’s character’s name. 

“Marcus Aquila — we had 
a whole day of conversation 
about how would you say his 
name: Ack-qui-la or Ack-quila,” 
Tatum said. “We settled on 
Marcus Ack-quila, because 

depending on where you were 
from, you would pronounce it 
differently.”

Now that filming’s done, 
Tatum said he misses the 
on-set bromance with co-star 
Jamie Bell. 

“In our business, you see 
each other so intensely for 
that long of a time, over three 
months,” Tatum said. “Every 
single day — and then you just 
leave. You leave each other, 
and you go through withdraw-
als for a little while. It’s hard 
to keep in touch with people, 
but he will always be one of 
my dearest friends. I’m going 
to see him soon, so I’m pretty 
excited. Kind of like seeing an 
old girlfriend or something.”

the shit-smelling bowels of southern England, where he’s 
injured trying to save his men.  

The movie only begins after 30 minutes of meander-
ing anguish, and this opening sets the tone. Marcus is 
featured as a capable warrior, a depressed patient and the 
eventual owner of an English slave named Esca (Jamie 
Bell), who Marcus saved from death in a gladiator ring. 
Tatum and Bell take off across gloomy Scotland, turn-
ing what could have been a fairly interesting bonding 
experience between two budding friends into a shameless 
display of testosterone-fueled passive-aggressive angst. 
The rest of the plot isn’t bad so much as overly famil-
iar — there’s bonding, backstabbing and dramatic fight 
scenes (see also: “Mean Girls”) and eventual back-patting 
resolution.  

For a movie that relies so much on the grit of its fight 
sequences, “The Eagle” displays a nauseating misunder-
standing of combat style and canon — battles induce 
headaches, as if shot in the midst of an earthquake, 
making it difficult to focus on images of flashing swords 
and metal. The editing also mutes the film’s bloodshed, 
skirting around throat-slittings and stabbings, ultimately 
steering clear of the bloodlust that successful blockbusters 
“300” and “Gladiator” fed on. 

The duration of “The Eagle” finds Tatum nailing his 
singular facial expression: the furrowed scowl, pioneered 
by emo kids worldwide. Bell carries the film, squinting, 
shivering and gasping from heavy blows, coolly assessing 
a grey countryside and barking insults at his superior — 
his Esca is remarkably resilient and scrappy.  

But neither actor is helped by the clunky dialogue that 
limps along for the length of the film in a more affected 
gait than Marcus after his injury. Lines lacking spark are 
delivered with monotone, inspiring apathy toward the 
characters and their words. 

While inoffensive, the movie’s uninspiring, boiler-
plate approach to period drama has us revisiting Russel 
Crowe’s infamous “Gladiator” question: “Are you not 
entertained?” The jury’s still out.

Based on the Academy Award-winning film, this highly 
anticipated musical follows the hilarious, dysfunctional and 
fundamentally sincere members of the Hoover family, as 
they desperately attempt to get youngest member Olive to 
a regional beauty pageant across the country.  The play is 
produced by Tony-winners William Finn and James Lapine 
(“Romance in Hard Times,” “Into the Woods”) and will begin 
this Tuesday at the La Jolla Playhouse. (RE)

(Emily Blunt) from opposite 
sides of rival, color-coded 
gardens, who must cope with 
their forbidden love and, in the 
process, try to convince their 
ceramic pals that war is not the 
answer. With mediocre anima-
tion and a cornucopia of stale 
ideas, the film promises all the 
stuff little kids are into — you 
know, Shakespeare, Sir Elton 
John and, um, lawn ornaments.

To no one’s surprise, little of 
the film actually resembles the 
classic tragedy. The few referenc-
es that do surface are presented 
with such mindless obviousness 
(like two gardens are owned by 
a man and a woman named, 
hmm, Montague and Capulet) 
that it’s as if the writers are whis-
pering, “Get it?” The result, and 
chief  of the film’s many failures, 
is an audience divided between 
children who won’t pick up on it 
and parents who won’t care. 

These gnomes don’t look so 
hot, either. With plain, unde-
fined features, they come across 
as hollow shells. Meanwhile, 

the breathtaking, meticulously 
detailed environments of Pixar 
animation are replaced with 
cheap-looking scenes of fences, 
shrubs and identical houses. 

“Gnomeo” also suffers 
from unimaginative attempts 
at humanization that are 
consistently overwrought or 
incomprehensible. Gnomes love 
lawnmowers (in their world, 
they’re like cars). Gnomes hate 
dogs (and vice versa). Gnomes 
keep their gardens watered and 
perfectly manicured (makes it 
easy on the homeowners). 

The all-important role of 
bumbling-but-lovable side-
kick is squandered on Juliet’s 
aggressively annoying, sexually 
ambiguous frog (Ashley Jensen) 
and Gnomeo’s silent, feature-
less mushroom named Shroom. 
Peripheral characters are crip-
pled by lifeless, left-field perfor-
mances from a slew of superflu-
ous cameos, each more baffling 
than the last: Jason Statham as 
Tybalt, a television commercial 
narrated by Hulk Hogan and 
a plastic deer voiced by the 
mumbling Prince of Darkness 

himself, Ozzy Osbourne. 
Adding to the madness is 

executive producer Elton John’s 
out-of-place soundtrack, which 
includes plenty of his classics, 
as well as a tragically forgettable 
new original, “Hello, Hello,” fea-
turing an awkward duet with fel-
low glamour queen Lady Gaga.

It’s difficult not to blame 
the extensive team of writers 
for this mess. The dull script 
half-assedly inserts Shakespeare 
quotes into idiotic monologues 
that sound unfinished. “Why 
must you wear a blue hat?” begs 
Juliet from her balcony. “Why 
couldn’t it be red like my father? 
Or green like, like a leprechaun? 
Or purple like, uh, like some 
weird guy?” 

Even for a children’s film, it’s 
difficult to ignore some of the 
more major inconsistencies (are 
we just supposed to brush over 
the implied romance between 
Gnomeo’s mom and Juliet’s 
dad at the end?). In fact, these 
soulless trolls are so unfunny, 
so absolutely devoid of likable 
human characteristics or believ-
able goals, that the biggest disap-

pointment comes during the 
film’s conclusion, when (spoiler!) 
we are woefully deprived of the 
double-suicide bloodbath prom-
ised by Shakespeare’s original. 

Occasionally, “Gnomeo” 
even dares to mock its source 
material — and not just by vir-
tue of being such a catastrophic 
adaptation. At the film’s climax, 
a suddenly and inexplicably 
self-aware Gnomeo chats up a 
statue of William Shakespeare, 
as the two literally compare and 
contrast the plot of “Romeo and 
Juliet” with what has happened 
in the film so far. “I think this 
ending is much better,” says 
Gnomeo in the final scene, just 
before the entire cast gears up 
for a hackneyed community 
dance-a-thon/curtain call. 

Somehow, “Gnomeo and 
Juliet”’s defiant atrociousness 
feels like a swan song for the 
legendary bard. This tale of 
star-crossed lovers has been 
reworked to death — be it 
nimble-footed gangsters or 
Leonardo DiCaprio — and is 
finally buried here, under the 
lawn.

HIATUSÊ THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 2011Ê THE UCSD GUARDIANÊ9

The Guardian 
Rise Against/RIMAC Arena San Diego
1/4 page(5” x 8”) • BW    Pub Date: 2/10/2011

Y ou can usually pull off dubstep by sticking to a formula — bust out 
some syncopated beats and 
face-melting wobbly bass 
(you know, that distinct 
“wobwobwobwob” sound) — 
and you’re ready to invade 
dorm rooms everywhere. 

But 22-year-old UK 
import James Blake is 
breaking away from the 
grimy pack. On last year’s 
Klavierwerke EP, the 
London-based producer 
tore up his roots to stretch 
the boundaries of what 
dubstep can be. The record’s 
four songs — primarily 
composed of sampled and 
distorted footage of Blake 
singing and playing piano 
at home — introduced ele-
ments of soul and outright 
silence to the mix, solidify-
ing Blake’s position as one of 
the most forward-thinking 
artists in electronic music. 

Now, on his self-titled, 
full-length debut, Blake 
exceeds the expectations set 
by his first three EPs (and 
his second-place finish on 
BBC’s “Sound of 2011” poll) 
by progressing even further. 
Blake isn’t just a beat-maker 
anymore. He’s doing the 
unthinkable: writing actual 
pop songs. 

Good ones.

Single “The Wilhelm 
Scream” has Blake breaking 
out his best Marvin Gaye 
imitation, expressing uncer-
tainty and remorse with a 
kind of emotional impact 
rarely achieved by tradi-
tional singer-songwriters, let 
alone avant-garde dubstep 
producers.

Even on more dance-
oriented tracks like “I Mind” 
and “To Care (Like You),” 
Blake imbues his digital 
compositions with vulner-
able vocal performances 
that impart a strong sense of 
presence. 

On the outstanding “I 
Never Learnt To Share,” 
Blake manipulates layers of 
vocal tracks and surrounds 
them with beds of chilly 
synthesizers. The slow build-
up takes some patience, but 
the restraint makes the final 
dub-dissonance all the more 
dramatic. 

Even when the album 
doesn’t engage in sonic 
trickery, the songs impress 
with their emotional impact 
alone. With that kind of 
ingenuity, James Blake is 
as promising an electronic 
debut as there’s been in a 
while.

London-Based Producer Proves Your 
Dubstep Can Use Some Soul

T hese days, every coun-try seems to have its banner synth-rock 
band: America has LCD 
Soundsystem, France has 
Phoenix and Australia has 
Cut Copy, the project of DJ/
songwriter Dan Whitford 
(think James Murphy with an 
Aussie accent). 

Cut Copy’s newest release, 
Zonoscope, is the band’s most 
ambitious work yet, taking 
the usual ’80s influences 
(Duran Duran, New Order) 
and blending them seamlessly 
with modern pop sensibilities. 

The band has always 
taken cues from the Reagan 
era — as evidenced on previ-
ous releases, such as 2008’s In 
Ghost Colours — but they’ve 
never been this cohesive.

Cut Copy are relentless 
with the time-warping track 
after track.  “Take Me Over” 
unabashedly cops a few hooks 
from Men At Work’s 1981 
jam “Down Under” (just not 
the signature flute) — though 
with the addition of extra 
“oohs” and percussion, they 
avoid the expected pastiche.   

The deep vocals of 
“Blink And You’ll Miss A 
Revolution” sound sort of 
like Oingo Boingo, but synth 
glockenspiel, of all things, 
adds a modern, creative 
touch. Plus, the songs, filled 

with more melodic back-
ground harmonies and a rol-
licking drum loop, are pure 
fun. 

Many songs rely on hyp-
notic build-ups and break-
downs. “Need You Now” 
kicks off the album with the 
perfect climb: Atmospheric 
hums give way to drum loops 
and cowbell, while some 
synthesizer shimmers into the 
introduction of Whitford’s 
wistful vocals.  All this means 
that by the time the track 
reaches its chorus, you’re 
already in dance-floor heaven. 

As Zonoscope’s ’80s dream 
comes to a close, Cut Copy 
deviates the most from the 
throwback formula. Fifteen-
minute album ender “Sun 
God” starts off like your stan-
dard dance pop, but suddenly 
switches gears to psychedelia. 
Drifting away into a long 
instrumental, atmospheric 
outro, it’s the group’s most 
expansive work to date.

At the core of nearly every 
track on Zonoscope is a deep 
reverence for past musi-
cal heroes. Cut Copy take 
hooks (sometimes literally) 
from their icons, but pile on 
enough instruments and 
sing-along verses to break 
from the synth-rock pack.

T he Pains of Being Pure at Heart refuse to grow up.  They want to be teens of the ’80s forever, packing cutesy, New Wave nos-talgia into each release.
 So the second single and title track from their upcoming LP 

Belong is no detour from the trend. Like the band’s past work has 
done so well, the track brings a pop sensibility to emo-kid influ-
ences a la My Bloody Valentine and the Jesus and Mary Chain. 

With an abundance of distorted guitars and hazy production, 
“Belong” may be the biggest anthem they’ve released yet. At cer-
tain points, the band breaches ’90s alt-rock territory, especially on 
the chorus (think Smashing Pumpkins meets the Cranberries). 

While they’re broadening their sound, the Pains of Being Pure 
at Heart stick to what they know best, holding on to their trade-
mark sugary sound, even when they’re playing musical dress-up. 
“Belong” is not the catchiest song in the band’s repertoire, but as 
far as charming indie pop goes, it’s still worth a listen.

I t’s been 10 years since the Strokes released their critically acclaimed debut Is This It? and another five since their last record, First Impressions Of Earth. Now lead single “Under Cover 
of Darkness” offers a glimpse at the band’s long-awaited comeback 
Angles, slated for release this March.
        The track manages to sound like classic Strokes material and 
their more recent experiments all at once. From the caustic guitar 
battle introduction between Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond Jr. 
to singer Julian Casablanca’s climactic pleas, the song is an exhibi-
tion of all the Strokes’ sonic ambitions over the past decade.  

It may not be the Strokes’ most memorable or original effort, 
but “Under Cover of Darkness” does deliver promising hooks that 
will draw fans back for repeated listens. As lyrical punctuation, 
Casablanca asks over and over, “Will you wait for me?”  If the past 
week’s online frenzy over the track’s release is any indication, it 
seems the man’s got his answer.

followed by a pair of doubleheaders 
against Colorado School of Mines on 
Saturday and Sunday. 

“Tess [Granath] and Camille 
[Gaito] have been very strong on the 
mound,” Gerckens said. “Their pitches 
are working, they have great compo-
sure and that’s been a highlight for us.”

Against NDNU, the Tritons took 
the first game of the season easily with 
an 8-0 win. Granath tossed a one-hit 
shutout and freshman Mya Romero 
went 3-3 with two doubles and a triple 
in her first game as a Triton. The sec-
ond game was a much closer affair, 
with Lesovsky getting a walk-off single 
in the ninth inning to seal the win.

The Tritons only allowed three runs 
in four games against CSM, but came 
out ahead in three of the four games. 
Gaito led the Tritons in the first game, 
throwing six scoreless innings to get a 
5-1 win. Granath threw a gem of her 
own in the second game, but couldn’t 
get any run support until freshman 

Esther Storm brought home the win-
ning run in the eighth inning to end 
the game 1-0. 

UCSD suffered its first loss of the 
season in the first game on Sunday, 
despite Granath surrendering just 
one run in the 1-0 game. The Tritons 
bounced back in the second game of 
the day as Gaito threw a complete 
game four-hitter.

“We made a statement as a team for 
this year without even performing at 
our highest potential,” Woofter said. 
“Our pitchers did an extremely good 
job on the mound. As for our hitting, 
it wasn’t as strong as it will be in the 
future. But it just goes to show you that 
this is going to be a great year.”

The Tritons kick off their confer-
ence schedule with a game against San 
Francisco State on Friday. First pitch 
will be at 1 p.m. at Triton Softball 
Field.

While the Tritons have been practicing for some 
time, they are still trying to establish a regular line-
up, and many changes are expected for the next few 
weeks as the team plays more matches.

“We’ve been practicing, but actually playing you 
get a whole different view,” LaPlante said. “We’re 
still trying to tweak with the line-up.” 

The team will head to Arizona later this week 
for the Grand Canyon Invitational, where UCSD 
will face three Division II teams in Dallas Baptist, 
Hawaii Hilo and Hawaii Pacific.

“We’re not quite sure how strong they are, we 
haven’t played the team from Dallas in years, but 
Hawaii Pacific is going to be very tough,” LaPlante 
said.

She did express confidence that the Tritons 
would be able to win at least one of the three 
matches they are playing.

LaPlante said she expects to continue the success 
she has had in the past.

“For me personally, I’m ready for anything,” 
LaPlante said.

The Triton men opened their season with a bang 
by routing University of Redlands and Division I 

UC Riverside over the weekend. 
Against Redlands, the Tritons only dropped one 

set in singles competition, with Chapman Chan, 
Junya Yoshida, Erik Elliott, Vincent Nguyen and 
Austin West winning their matches in straight sets.  
Sam Ling also won his match after dropping the 
first set.

Redlands won their only match of the double in 
the doubles competition, but the pairings of Elliott-
West and Yoshida-Ling won their matches to give 
the Tritons the 8-1 win.

Against Riverside, Elliott led the way with a 6-4, 
6-1 victory in No. 1 singles. Overall, UCSD won five 
of the six singles matches and two of three doubles 
matches, although only one was recorded in the 
final score. UCSD took the victory by a score of 6-1.

The Triton men will also compete in the Grand 
Canyon Invitational. Once they return from Arizona, 
the Triton women will have a week off before facing 
Claremont-Mudd-Scripps on Saturday, Feb. 18 at 11 
a.m. at UCSD. The men’s squad will travel to Azusa 
Pacific on Feb. 17.

the two teams. 
“6-on-5 is one the top ways of scoring goals, so 

we were work on it constantly,” Kreutzkamp said. 
“If we don’t convert our 6-on-5s we’re probably not 
going to win the game.” 

Long Beach pulled out all the stops in the last 
two minutes, but thanks to an amazing block by 
junior goalkeeper Kirsten Oshtosh with time wind-
ing down, the Tritons held onto the victory. It was 
her 10th block of the day, and the one that sealed 
the one-goal victory.

“When we scored the last goal…I felt confi-
dent because our defense had been good most of 
the game,” Kreutzkamp said, “And it proved true, 

because we held them the rest of the game.”
Senior attacker Felicia Orozco had two goals in 

the first quarter for the Tritons, while fellow senior 
attacker Hanalei Crowell added two goals of her 
own.

The Tritons open Western Water Polo 
Association play on Friday against Cal State East 
Bay at Canyon View Pool at 6 p.m. 

They will also host the Triton Invitational 
Tournament this Saturday and Sunday, a 16-team, 
two-day tournament featuring some of the best 
teams in the state.

CLUB UPDATE: ICE HOCKEY TEAM 
MUCH IMPROVED FROM LAST SEASON
By Jessica Traynor
Staff Writer

CLUB HOCKEY — UCSD Hockey Club wrapped up a 
successful season in January, finishing with a 7-5 overall 
record. The mark is a vast improvement over last sea-
son, when the team had only one win.

The Tritons started the season off right with back-
to-back wins against UC Irvine. On Oct. 9, UCSD won 
10-3 in the first game of the season. Joe Digiuseppe 
scored the first Triton goal of the season, and led the 
team’s scorers with six goals. Jimmy Kloda made two 
goals and had five assists. Forward Kit Wong and 
captain Mike Frederick added one goal apiece. The 
Tritons picked up a 5-1 win on the same day with two 
goals from Frederick. Wong, Kolda, and Digiuseppe all 
scored one goal apiece. 

In an away game against College of the Canyons on 
Oct. 16, UCSD suffered a beat down with a final score 
of 15-1. Wong scored the lone Triton goal. 

The Tritons then had a home-and-home series 
with Chapman University on Oct. 22 and 23, with 
UCSD winning the two games by scores of 8-3 and 6-3, 
respectively. 

“We dominated them at home and [their] home” 
defenseman Tommy Tuohy said.

On Nov. 5, Cal State Northridge beat the Tritons, 
5-2. Kloda and Wong each scored once. “They’re a good 
team, we lost,” Tuohy said. 

On Nov. 12, the Tritons had perhaps their first close 
game of the season against UCLA. The game was back-
and-forth throughout, but UCLA pulled away at the 
end to win 6-4. Wong scored twice, and Digiuseppe and 

forward Kyle McNomara each added a goal.  
In their final games before winter break, the Tritons 

faced Santa Rosa Junior College on Nov. 13 and 
14. UCSD won the first game 2-1, as Frederick and 
Digiuseppe each scored to break Santa Rosa’s unbeaten 
record. 

The Tritons lost the second game by a score of 4-2, 
with forward Norman West scoring both goals.

Coming out of winter break, the Tritons were able to 
avenge their early-season loss to UCLA by beating the 
Bruins twice. On Jan. 7, the Tritons won 3-1, then came 
out with an impressive 7-3 victory the next day.

The Tritons lost their last game 7-2 against UC Santa 
Barbara on Jan. 16, with goals from West and Frederick. 

“The season went well do to the leadership of 
[Captian] Mike Frederick and Jimmy Kloda, and the 
solid play of incoming transfers and freshman,” forward 
Mike Tietsort said.

The improvement in record represented a huge step 
forward for the club.

“UCSD is building a strong base,” goalie Ryan 
Corriveay said, “[It’s] the best team I’ve ever had.” 

Overall, the team is young, and has high hopes for 
the future. 

“They should have a strong team [next year], espe-
cially due to goalie Ryan [Corriveay] and solid defense 
coming back,” Tietsort said.

Hockey Club is building up to a bright future, and 
the next season will be one to watch with the team 
returning in October.

Tritons Ready to Return to Postseason

SOFTBALL

The Tritons had a tough finish to last season, falling out of contention for the conference tournament on the penultimate day of the regular season. UCSD came into 
a four-game series in fourth place in the standings, but a split 
of the games with Cal State San Bernardino eliminated both 
squads.

UCSD finished the year with a 30-20 record and in sixth 
place in the conference, a disappointment after making the 
NCAA West Regional Tournament every year since 2007. Head 
coach Patti Gerckens and her squad will look to get back on 
track this spring.

“Last year, I think we put ourselves in a must-win posi-
tion at the end of the year and we didn’t get the w’s,” senior 
shortstop Sarah Woofter said. “This year, I think we are going 
to win a ton more games and be in a position where we can be 
relaxed at the end. I do believe strongly that we will make the 
postseason and we will go far this year.”

The Tritons return six field starters and two pitchers, 
giving the team a line-up card very similar to last season’s. 

All-American center fielder Kris Lesovsky — the program’s 
all-time batting average leader at .446 — returns for her senior 
season. Lesovsky led the Tritons in every major offensive cat-
egory last season, when she hit .413 with 10 home runs and 
32 RBI.

All-American Camille Gaito and junior Tess Granath will 
lead the Tritons from the rubber this year, as Gaito looks to 
continue her form from last season, when she went 18-10 with 
a .96 ERA. Granath, a junior, is the only other Triton pitcher 
that has started a game for UCSD, and will try to build on the 
2010 season that saw her go 4-4 with a 2.82 ERA. 

UCSD will have to fill the hole left by graduated catcher 
Nicole Saari, who made two All-West region squads and the 
All-CCAA first team last year.

On their opening weekend, the Tritons went 5-1 thanks to 
some strong pitching by Gaito and Granath. The Tritons played 
a doubleheader against Notre Dame de Namur on Friday,

Men’s and Women’s Tennis Begin Season

By Jonathan Kaslow
Contributing Writer

TENNIS — Despite an improvement from 
their season opener, the Triton women are 
still looking for their first win after falling 
to Point Loma Nazarene 6-3.

For UCSD, the doubles team of Roxy 
Pourmirzaie and Tara Vanooteghm, and sin-
gles players Cindy Dao and Haley Perrotte 
won their respective matches, while the rest 
of the Tritons suffered defeat en route to 
the loss.

Coach Liz LaPlante, in her 32nd year as 
head coach at UCSD, expressed optimism 
about the rest of the season.

“We have some freshman players, for 
some girls they are playing their first col-
legiate matches, we are rearranging doubles 
teams and I’m very optimistic that we will 
get better.” LaPlante said.

This defeat comes after the Lady Tritons 
were swept 9-0 against Azusa Pacific this 
past Saturday.

WOMEN’S WATER POLO — It was a hard-
fought game, but the No. 17 UCSD women’s 
water polo team pulled off the victory in its 
home opener with a 9-8 win over Long Beach 
State. The score was tied until the last three 
minutes, when junior hole set Kirsten Bates 
scored and the Tritons held on to defeat the 
49ers in the their first game in Canyon View 
Pool this season.

“Long Beach has been a pretty good rival 
for us the last couple of years,” head coach 
Brad Kreutzkamp said. “The last four games, 
all but one have been decided by one goal, and 
one went into overtime. So we knew it was 
going to be a close game right from the begin-
ning, and we were prepared for that.”

The game was close until the very end, 
with neither team being able to pull away 
from the other. The score was tied 3-3 at the 
end of the first quarter and 5-5 at the half. In 
all, the lead changed four times in the game, 
and neither team ever had a lead of more than 
one point.

With the score tied 5-5 at halftime, Bates 
took over the game. Long Beach came out 
quick and scored in the first three minutes of 
the half to take the lead, but began slipping 
when the team started committing penalties 

and getting ejected. 
Bates took advantage of the 6-on-5 oppor-

tunities and scored off a 49ers turnover to 
tie it up at 6-6 less than 30 seconds after the 
49ers took the lead. Long Beach State received 
another ejection half way through the quar-
ter and Bates scored her second goal of the 
quarter off of a Crowell assist to give UCSD 
the lead.

Starting with the lead in the fourth quar-
ter, the Tritons narrowly missed blowing the 
game open when a series of shots just missed 
their mark or were blocked by the 49ers goal-
keeper. 

It almost seemed as though LBSU could 
stage the comeback and push the game ever 
further when they scored in the first minute 
of the fourth, but junior utility Natalie Peng 
led a quick strike back against the 49ers and 
scored less than 30 seconds later. 

The game was locked at 8-7 for most of 
the fourth quarter before the 49ers scored, 
with just under three minutes to go, to tie the 
score at 8-8. But the Tritons would answer 
quickly. Long Beach State received another 
ejection for physical play, and Bates again 
took advantage of the 6-on-5 opportunity. 
She scored her third goal of the game, and 
the goal that created the difference between
