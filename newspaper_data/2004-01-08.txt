An anonymous source alleging 
that animal abuse has been taking 
place at the Salk Institute for 
Biological Studies has led two ani-
mal rights groups to offer a reward 
for any information leading to con-
victions on animal cruelty charges. 

San Diego Animal Advocates 
and the Los Angeles-based Last 
Chance for Animals organizations 
are offering a combined $20,000 
for proof of abuse, they announced 
onJan.5. 

According to Jane Cartmill of 
San Diego Animal Advocates, the 
allegations include claims that 
researchers were overbreeding and 
killing off extra lab mice and that 
the skulls of baby monkeys were 
being opened without sufficient 
painkillers.

Biotech regulations 
may be toughened 
Officials fear terrorists 
could access research 

By VLADIMIR KOGAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

Federal officials say they have 
yet to decide whether to imple-
ment recommendations from an 
October 2003 report that urged 
increased regulation of biotech-
nology research, for fear that it 
could fall into the hands of ter-
rorists. 

The findings, published by the 
National Academy of Sciences, 
which advises Congress on scien-
tific policy, urged a combination 
of s~lf-regulation by researchers 
and journals that publish their 
findings, as well as increased gov-

, ernment oversight. 
"This proposal is a key step in 

an evolving process to strike the 
right balance between national 

security concerns and the open-
ness necessary for America's 
research enterprise to thrive," 
stated Gerald Fink, a professor at 
the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology and chair of the com-
mittee that wrote the report, in a 
press release. 

Fink and other top experts 
from around the nation , includ-
ing UC San Francisco biochem-
istry professor Eri n O'Shea, 
specifically pointed to recent 
research on mousepox that they 
fear terrorists could use as a blue-
print to create a more virulent 
and vaccine-re istant strain of 
smallpox.

I BRIEFLY 
Memorial will honor John 

Galbraith on Jan. 12 
A memorial tribute will be held for John S. 

Galbraith, professor emeritus of history and 
chancellor emeritus, on Jan. 12. 

Galbraith, who served as UCSD's second 
chancellor, died on June 10 after complica-
tions from pneumonia. He was 86. 

He served as chancellor from 1964 to 
1968 after having served as vice chancellor 
from 1962 to 1964. He saw the development 
of the young university through the Vietnam 
War and student protests. During his tenure, 
Galbraith championed the architecture of 
Geisel Library. 

He was also an expert in British imperial 
history, teaching at UClJI and writing four 
books on the subject. 

Galbraith retired from the University of 
California in 1986. 

The tribute will be held at the Faculty Club 
IromA p.m. to 6 p.rn. 

Two undergrads chosen to 
represent UCSD at UC Day 

Two UCSD undergraduate students have 
been chosen to represent UCSD at the 
University of California's fifth annual under-
graduate research showcase. 

Ben Maggos and Nick Statom will present 
their research as part of UC Day in Sacramento 
on March 9. 

Maggos, a senior, is a double-major in 
Philosophy and Interdisciplinary Computing 
and the Arts. Masgos conducted research for 
the California Institute for Telecommunications 
and Information Technology, working with fac-

u�ty advisors on visualizatIOns of the Cal(IT)2 
building under construction at UCSD. His work 
included converting line drawings and floor 
plans into three-dimensional models. 

Statom, a junior, is majoring in Mechanical 
Engineering. He was nominated for his 
research on the "Analysis of Sea Breeze Effects 
Usmg QuickSCAT and SeaWinds Scatterometry:' 
His research is part of a NASA program called 
Ocean Vector Winds, which deploys SeaWinds 
scatterometers on satellites. These measure 
near·surface wind velocity under all conditions 
on all the Earth's oceans. Statom's work includ-
ed analyzing the resulting data with a goal of 
evaluating the tandem scatterometer mission's 
skill at detecting land and sea breeze effects. 

Statom and Maggos will receive plaques dur-
ing the Alumni Association-sponsored UC Day 
honoring their participation. A poster of their 
research will be displayed for one week outside 
the Governor's Office in the Capitol Building.

UCSD biologists make 
anthrax breakthrough 

UCSD biologists have determined how a 
toxin produced by anthrax blocks a person's 
immune response, findings that could possi-
bly lead to new treatments for anthrax infec· 
tions. 

The researchers have described why, in the 
presence of anthrax. human immune cells fail 
to respond normally. The body normally pro-
duces cytokines, which alert other cells to the 
presence of an invader. Anthrax suppresses 
thiS response, preventing a normal irnmune 
response. The anthrax bacteria are thus able to 
multiply unhindered. 

The researchers say they have identified a 
protein molecule targeted by the anthrax toxin 
and determined where it acts in the sequence 
of immune response. 

They also identified a second route in the 
cell, thus far unknown, by which series of 
proteins activate one another to switch on 
cytokine production. This second route, they 
discovered, is the one the anthrax toxin tar-
gets. 

Their findings, to be published in the Jan. 
15 issue of The Journal of Immunology, sug-
gest that developing a drug that could prevent 
the anthrax toxin from splitting could help pre-
vent infection frorn going out of control as the 
anthrax bacteria would be unable to evade 
immune response. 

About 75 percent of people infected with 
inhalation anthrax die, even with appropriate 
antibiotics, according to the Center for Disease 
Control. 

The anthrax research was headed by UCSD 
biology professor Michael David and was sup-
ported by a grant from the National Institutes 
of Health.

I A.S. COUNCIL AT A GLANCE 
Meeting 114 

J anuary 7, 2004 

Items of Immediate 
Consideration 
ItemB 

The A.S. Council tabled indefinitely a 
$12 5 allocation for an all-campus dance 
planned by the council's freshman sena-
tors. 

Counci lmembers raised concerns about 
the appropriateness of drawing funds from 
the college level all-campus programming 
fund, which is meant for campus organiza-
tions to put on programs for the campus at 
large. Also at issue was the incomplete 
budget for the dance. 

The allocation was tabled indefinitely 
with a vote of 9-7 -4. 

Later in the meeting, Commissioner of 
Programming Alex Kushner 3lUlounced 
that if the band scheduled for the Buzz 
concert on Jan. 23 is not able to perform, 
the Programming Office would help to 
fund the dance. 

Reports 
President Jeremy Paul Gallagher 

Gallagher reported that the quarterly 
recreation fee will increase by $5 beginning 
Fall 2004. The referendum, which origi-
nally authorized the fee, allows for an 
increase every five years to compensate for 
inflation. 

Vice President Finance Eric Webster 
Webster reported that the Finance 

Office will no longer endorse allocations 
from the general unallocated fund due to 
the funds current balance of about S200. 

Commissioner of Programming Alex 
Kushner 

Kushner reported that Poner's Pub is 
now offering "College Night" on 
Thursdays from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. 
Discounted food and drinks as well as a DJ 
will be provided and all students are wel-
come. 

Kushner also announced that Flogging 
Molly and Area 51 will perform on Jan. 9 at 
8 p.m. in Price Center Plaza. The concert 

is free to UCSD srudents. 

Eleanor Roosevelt CoUege Sophomore 
Senator Max Harrington 

Harrington reported that a free show-
ing of the movie "Office Space" will take 
pl ace on Jan . 13 at 9 p.m. in Plaza Cafe. 
While the event is geared for Revelle 
College residents, all students are welcome 
to free popcorn and encouraged to wear 
pajamas at the event. 

Council Caucus 
The council discussed problems with 

the implementation of instant runoff vot-
ing on StudentLink for next quaner's A.S. 
elections. According to Eleanor Roosevelt 
College Junior Senator Carol Freire, 
StudentLink programmers have reponed 
that they will not be able to integrate IRV 
into the system in time for the elections. 

A straw poll taken during the discussion 
revealed strong council support for the use 
of IRV this year, even if paper ballots must 
be used. 

David Goodwin, chair of student coun-
cil of Eleanor Rooseve.lt College, said that 
the A.S. Council should not " roll over" and 
accept the infeasibility ofIRV implementa-
tion. 

Other possible solutions mentioned by 
council members included using free open 
source code for the IRV system, hiring a 
third-party company to conduct the elec-
tion and pressuring the university adminis-
tration to prioritize the implementation of 
IRVon StudentLink. 

Old Business 
Item 8 

The A.S. Council approved the AlI -
Campus Commuter Board charter by con-
sensus. The new board will serve as an 
umbrella organization for college-level 
commuter associations, advocate for the 
needs of commuter students and publish a 
bi-quanerly newsletter to studentS who live 
off-campus.

Salk: Anonymous source 
identifies 4 employees 

continued from page I 
said. "But we're hoping that by 
offering this reward, someone will 
come forward." 

According to Cartmill, the 
source made claims against a 
researcher, a researcher's assistant, 
an administrator and a veterinarian. 
Cartmill said the source accused 
the researcher of overbreeding 
mice, the assistant of opening the 
monkeys' skulls without enough 
anesthetic and the administrator of 
covering up employee complaints, 
threatening employees with job 
dismissal and failing to file required 
federal documents keeping track of 
experiments and the number of 
animals involved. Only "vague" 
claims of animal neglect were made 
against the veterinarian, she said. 

The Salk Institute said in aJan. 5 
statement that it has procedures in 
place to monitor and report on ani-
mal treatment and that the institute 
is committed to conducting studies 
in a "humane manner." 

Cartmill said, she was first e-
mailed the allegations in July. 
When she tried to reply, the e-mail 
failed to send successfully, she said. 
However, the animal groups only 
made the claims public on J an . 5 
after months of trying to meet with 
Salk officials, they claim. 

The institute's statement 
explained that they requested that 
San Diego Animal Advocates " pro-
vide in writing the specifics of their 
unsubstantiated allegations about 
animal abuse." 

"To thi date, the institute has 
not received a response to its 
request," the statement continued. 

Cartmill claims that the group 
did respond, but that "the answer 
was 'no,'" 

"We refused to give informa-

T1i8 

tion to Salk until we and our vet-
erinarians sit down with them," 
Cartmill said. "We don't want 
them to Start a witch hunt." 

While the federal Animal 
Welfare Act would protect pri-
mates from the treatment alleged 
by the source, there are currently 
no laws that protect rodents. 

Cartmill also expressed concern 
over the recent donation by Irwin 
Jacobs of 57 million to the insti-
tute's neurosciences-division. 

"Brain-mapping experiments are 
among the most devastating to ani-
mals and involve tremendous 
depravation and suffering," she said. 

According to published Salk 
Institute research in monkey visual 
conex neurotechnique, some of 
these experiments involve restrain-
ing alert, non-anesthetized monkeys 
in horizontal chairs. The monkeys' 
-heads are restrained by cranial head-
posts surgically implanted into their 
slruJls. They are then shown visual 
stimuli and positively reinforced 
with fruit juice. These experiments 
are in compliance with National 
Instirute of Health guidelines. 

Salk officials unavailable for 
comment on experiments involving 
opening brains of younger primates, 
those in which one of the alleged 
incidents would have taken place. 
. Cartmill said San Diego Animal 
Advocates will be displaying a ban-
ner and handing out flyers in front 
of the institute on a regular basis. 
The banner advertises the tip line 
e-mail address : tipS@llnimlll4dvo-
cll/es.org. 
-' Chris De Rose, actor and presi-
dent of Last Chance for Animals, 
said he hoped to see the experi-
ments ultimately stopped. 

"I would at least like to see them 
ju tify their experiments," he said.

UC, CSU strive to save energy 
Schools receive $12 million grant 
Iy BRYAN TSAO 

Associate News Editor 

The California Public Utilities 
Commission awarded the 
University of California and 
California State University a S 12 
million grant to implement ener-
gy efficiency programs on Dec. 
18. The grant, which will be 
divided evenly between the 
University of California and 
California State University, would 
be used to fund renovations and 
retrofits of buildings in order to 
make them more energy efficient. 

"This award is a great step 
toward implementing our envi-
ronmental sustainability policies," 
UC Senior Vice President for 

Business and Finance Joseph P. 
Mullinix said. "It will really boost 
our energy efficiency efforts." 

The grant will help implement 
a new Board of Regents policy to 
shift to "green" buildings and 
establish a standard for the use of 
clean energy sources. 

The policy, adopted in July 
2003, calls for the University of 
California to incorporate the use 
of renewable energy sources and 
meet minimum standards for 
energy efficiency with the goal of 
meeting 20 percent of its energy 
needs with renewable sources by 
2017 and reducing total energy 
consumption by 10 percent by 
2014. 

The grant will primarily be 

used to fund energy efficiency 
retrofits and training programs, 
including the installation of ener-
gy-saving lighting and light con-
trols; heating, ventilation and air 
conditioning upgrades; improved 
energy management controls; the 
" re-tuning" of buildings' energy 
systems to ensure maximum effi-
ciency; and energy efficiency . 
training for employees. 

According to the UC Office of 
the President, the initiatives will 
save up to 20 percent of each 
building's energy use. The univer-
sities will implement the pro-
grams begilUling February 2004 
in conjunction wi th the Paci Ii c

that any such policy also factors in 
state support, and we are looking 
forward to seeing the details of his 
budget." 

In reaction to cuts in state 
funding, fees were raised by 30 
percent last year at the University 
of California. 

State Sen. Dede Alpert (D-San 
Diego) also expressed concern 
over cuts to the university. 

"Higher education has already 
taken a big hit, and I'm very con-
cerned that we're going to have 
to return on a promise to 
Californians," Alpert said. "At 
the rate we're going, I'm afraid 
we're going to see a couple of 
ca mpuses close their doors to 
new students." 

While Alpert agreed with 

Schwarzenegger's call to limit 
rises in fees, she said she did not 
feel his opening UC Merced at 
this time was realistic. 

"I personally feel that, where 
we are today, we can't afford to 
fund UC Merced," she said. 

At UCSD, student reaction to 
the governor's address was varied. 

"My first reaction was that it 
was such a complete speech," 
College Republicans Vice 
President Adam Richards sa id . 
"He didn't dodge any of the 
issues. He said higher education 
would have to bear some of the 
brunt, but was quick to point Out 
that the problem [leading to cuts) 
was left to him from the previous 
administration. He's not playing 
the blame game; he's just stating a 
fact." 

Kate Maull , president of the 
College Democrats, said her orga-
nization felt Schwarzenegger was 
"still just giving promises." 

"He still hasn't given us any-
thing concrete to work from," she 
said. "We still JUSt want the num-
bers. We don't want to be skepti-
cal, but we can't help it when he 
just keeps talking more, not giving 
us numbers, facts or actual solu-
tions." 

Political science professo r and 
California politics expert Thad 
Kousser said he is also eagerly 
awaiting Jan. 10 to see the details 
of the governor's proposal. 

"He did a good job on the 
speech," he said. "But the budget 
is really where we'll see where the 
pain will come in $15 billion in 
cuts. "

Jobs are priority to CA 
G' ov. Arnold Sch warzenegge r's State of the State 
address onJan_ 6 served as a 
primer for upcoming policy 
aecisions that will be set-
tled in the January budget 
revision and the March pri-
mary's ballot initiatives. 

Schwarzenegger has 
already worked diligently to 
assess California's economic 
situation and compose solu-
tions_ While the fruits of 
those accomplishments were 
discussed, the toughest deci-
sions for Schwarzenegger to 
make will have to be spelled 
out later this week In his 
budget proposal. 

When speaking about 
higher education, 

chwarzenegger admirably 
delivered a plan to cap stu-
dent fee increases at 10 Eer-
cent per year year after UC 
tudents saw a devastating 

30 percent hike in the last 
12 months. But while the 
governor works to keep 
California's public colleges 
affordable, he must recog-
nize that the quality of 
instruction and research at 
the University of California 
must not be diminished 
further than the $1 billion-

plus already slashed from a 
crucial engine of the state's 
economy. 

Restoring the economy, 
Schwarzenegger said, was 
his utmost priority. His plans 
to reform the atrocious 
worker's compensation laws 
and lobby businesses 
throughout the world to 
come to California are right 
on. However, he should also 
use his action-star clout in 
Washington to chime in on 
free traae agreements that 
have sent jobs across borders 
and overseas - especially 
high-tech positions in 
Silicon Valley that were once 
a cornerstone of the state's 
tax base and have recently 
been treated as exportable 
commodities. 

Further, decentralizing 
K- 12 education will devas-
tate the funding of already 
impoverished rural and 
inner city schools, leaving 
California's young people 
more unprepared for an 
increasingly competitive 
job market. 

Schwarzenegger must 
address these issues in the 
coming months if he wants 
to guide the state back to 
prosperity. 

Misguided provision up 
for round of redraft 

W ith the Higher Education Act up for reauthorization 
this yea r, lawmakers have a 
chance to repeal the mis-
!!Uided 1998 rrovision that ~enies federa financial aid 
to students with prior drug 
convictions. The provision, 
which asks students on the 
Free Application for Federal 
Student Aid if they have 
ever been convicted of "seil-
ing or possessing drugs," has 
resulted in thousands of 
denied grants and loans over 
the last five years. 

Drafted in the crime and 
punishment spirit of the 
War on Drugs, the provision 
ignores the fact that educa-
tion is perhaps the most 
effective deterrent to dru~ 
abuse. Since the provisions 
inception, over 100 student 
governments have voiced 
opposition , while several 
Universities have nobly

dents who were denied aid 
because of a drug offense. 

Penalizing students for a 
conviction that they have 
already settled in court is 
erroneous and ineffective. 
Not only does the law pun-
ish students for the same 
offense twice, it hinges 
financial aid on a number of 
ulterior socioeconomic fac-
tors well beyond the scope of 
academia - namely, who is 
arrested on drug charges. 

Despite improvement 
since the 19905, the rate of 
black juveniles arrested for 
drugs remained almost 
twice that of white juveniles 
in 2001, according to the 
Office of Juvenile Justice 
and Delinquency 
Prevention. 

As President Jimmy 
Carter told Congress in 
1977, "Penalties against 
drug use should not be 
more damaging to an indi-
vidual than the use of the 
drug itself. " The 1998 
HEA provision is such a 
penalty and should bl! 
repea led.

• I LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Cuts to outreach 

would affed college 
preparation 

Editor. 
When everyone else around 

you doubts your success, it is hard 
to keep focus toward higher edu-
cation. This is why it is necessary 
to oppose Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger's proposed bud-
get cuts to the University of 
California's Outreach Programs 
and to budget cuts to outreach at 
California State University cam-
puses. These programs provide 
essential college preparation to 
approximately 110,000 low-
income youngsters throughout 
the state. 

Coming from a working class 
Latino community where college-
going rates are often below the 
norm, one often finds it hard to 
receive the necessary academic 
assistance and motivation. Many 
families in these neighborhoods 
are working hard to merely pay 
rent and feed their children. 
Their priorities do not consist of 
getting good S.A.T. scores or 
passing the AP Calculus test. 

As a student in this type of 
community, it is hard to strive for 
h igher education when nobody 
else around you is motivating 
you to succeed. Programs like 
the Early Academic Outreach 
Program conducted by the 
University of California actually 
made the effort to come to my 
high school and inform me about 
important info rmation that I 

would not have known other-
wise . They offe red test prep 
workshops that I otherwise 
would not have been able to 
afford. I had an academic mentor 
who would come every other 
week to check on my progress. 
That may not seem like much, 
but it actually is - especially 
when it seems as though nobody 
else around you cares if you even 
graduate high school. 

Without outreach, I don't 
know if! would have had the same 
knowledge or motivation to go to 
college. In order to stay competi -
tive with other high schools, it is 
important to have outreach pro-
grams that help low-income 
schools where resources are mini -
mal. 

1 am now an undergraduate 
student at UCSD and I have since 
had the privilege to work with 
EAOP. I see the difference my 
program makes in t he low-
income communities of San 
Diego. 

The EAOP program that I help 
coordinate offers tutoring and 
mentoring services to kids living in 
Section 8 housing, which is com-
prised mostly of newly immigrated 
families who have little resoutces 
at their schools. We offer school 
children in these families' hope 
and guidance. We give them a 
chance to dream and succeed when 
they feel hopeless about going to 
coJlege. I have had many students 
say that they don't feel like they are 
"cut out" for college. 

With the destruction of out-
reach programs like EAOP will 
come many devastated students 
who may never-get the chance to 
go to college.

Aftermath of finals reveals hidden benefits Letters: 

Aftertaste 
Evelyn Hsieh 

N obody likes final exams. They're like those clown faces that you keep knock-
ing down but inevitably pop back 
up to torment you once again. 

At a closer glance, though, the 
week devoted to these despicable 
entities yi elds some interesting 
insights about the very human vic-
ti ms it claims. 

If desperate times call for des-
perate measures, desperation 
breeds a certain brand of zaniness 
and ideality during the death week 
that all of us have to encounter. In 
fact, it can even seem that finals 
week draws out the true character 
of UCSD students, luring them 
out of their spider holes of hum-
drum banality when they have no 
choice but to go. 

In the aftermath of fall quar-
ter finals, much can be learned 
from the week everybody loves to 
hate. 

For one thing, finals week 
actually gives students a chance 
to slow down. This may sound 
absurd, since eleventh week is 
but a condensed few days of 
stress and studying. But really, 
the quarter system, prevalent on 
most UC campuses, provides stu-
dents with a perpetual sense of 
urgency. Ten wel!ks go by in a 
blink of an eye; a flurry of 
midterms, labs, papers and a fraz-
zled student caught somewhere 
in between. I had a friend who 
had ten midterms during the 

quarter; it's like some sick parade 
that we involuntarily have to 
attend in order to graduate. So it 
should come as something of a 
relief when an entire week is 
reserved for finals and only 
finals. 

Yes, round-the-clock studying 
is probably in order, but when else 
do we get to structure time so 
individually? The reading sched-
ule on syllabi is now irrelevant (as 
if it wasn't before), and in many 
cases, what stands between an A-
and a B+ is how you align the clock 
\vi th the material. 

It is only during finals week 
that students show their studying 
stamina and time-management 
mettle. The week goes by slowly 
because there is so much so-called 
"free time" in students' hands. 
Even procrastinators can rejoice 
- the whole week is basically last-
minute, so there 's less temptation 
to wait until the literal last minute. 

Studying takes priority, but 
once a fina l is done, it is done. As 
final exams end, one by one, for 
better or for worse, students cling 
to the hope that at the end of the 
week, nothing will be left at the 
end of week. Students have a 
chance to channel their energies 
and concentrate at a steadier 
pace. 

In a way, finals week brings an 
anomalous yet idealistic atmos-
phere. When else are classes actu-
ally filled to capacity levels' 
Besides midterm season, this is 
the only time when everyone 
enrolled shows up (the way it was 
meant to be, no?). When else are 
books opened, both in terms of 
pages and of plastic packaging? 

Final exam scheduling allows 
for a fairly spread-out stream of 
students that contributes to a busy 

but not over-crowded Price 
Center Plaza. It is also nice know-
ing that the shuttle is hardly ever 
overflowing during this week as a 
result of the irregular schedule. 
The campus is charmingly 
bustling and it's kind of amusing to 
see a cramming student positioned 
on each Library Walk block just 
before a final. 

This may all sound somewhat 
irrelevant, even inappropriately 
so, in light of the seriousness of 
fi nals, but really, have you ever just 
paused for a moment and 
observed? 

UCSD as an abbreviation is 
somewhat oxymoronic . T he let-
ters UC connote scholarly pres-
tige, intense intellect and students 
of the highest academic pedigree 
and initiative. Read any college 
handbook or guide; it'll tell you 
that and then some. On the other 
hand, think of SD or San Diego, 
and visions of shoreline leisure, 
fun in the sun and the distinctly 
Californian ethic of relaxation 
dance through your head. 
Combine the two, and UCSD 
paints a contrasting picture of 
both hardcore studying and hard-
core partying. 

Step into a UCSD library dur-
ing finals week and it's easy to see 
how this is the case. At Geisel, stu-
dents swarm onto all floors to 
study to their hearts' content. 
Geisel is a representation of the 
reputed academic strength that 
UCSD students bring to the 
school. Of course, it is anything 
but odd to find students at any 
university studying hard at the 
library the week of final exams. 

Contrast venerable old Geisel 
to the eleventh-week scene at 
CUCS, and the cha racter of 
UCSD emerges like a good wine 

enhancing the flavors of a meal. 
CLICS never closes during finals 
week. CLICS is bursting at the 
seams with students. Students, 
mind you, who litter the carpet 
with food wrappers, who bring 
sleeping bags, who clog the com-
puter desks to sign on to AOL 
Instant Mesenger, who blast 
music on their CD players, who 
read magazines, who chat up a 
storm with their study buddies. 
Students actually dress up to go 
to CLICS in hopes of meeting 
some o ther similarly-minded 
people. The atmosphere resem-
bles more of a sl umber party than 
a study sess ion. 

It 's actually a lot of fun if 
you're not too worried or serious 
about ge tting studying done. 
Around midnight, the CLICS 
staff hands out free coffee, and 
there is still a steady buzz of con-
versation into the wee hours of 
the nigh t . 

Anyone who complains about 
the dearth of social activity at 
UCSD obviously never has been 
to CLICS during finals week. The 
craziness and sheer energy of the 
place is entirely representative of 
UCSD. Frenzied studying, late 
night hours and friends make a 
combustible elixir only finals week 
can whip up. 

Most students will have gone 
through at least 12 rounds of finals 
before graduation - the groaning 
will never cease, and the end of the 
week will always be cause for cele-
bration. I don't like finals either. 
But sometimes, only in the midst 
of the most detestable times do the 
least detestable aspects become 
clear.

Column fa ils

the issues 

comin ued from page 4 
that the right to strike for other 
unions (sympathy str ikes) is a ludi-
crous demand tha t is inconsequen-
tial when compared to wages, 
health care and wo rking condi-
tions. Howeve r, has the author 
considered where these rights come 
from? 

Sympathy strikes encourage col-
laboration between unions to ba r-
ga in collectively fo r improved 
wages, health care and working 
conditions. Wi thout the right to 
have sympathy strikes, the student 
union will never get cooperation 
from the other unions on campus. 
If the university succeeds in elimi-
nating sympathy strikes from aJl 
unions on campus, the university 
will have effectively broken the 
unions' collective bargaining 
power. 

The TA union has set an excel-
lent example by standing up for 
their right to bargain collectively, 
and I hope that other unions on 
campus will foJlow suit. If the stu-
dent union can make mutual pro-
tection agreements with other 
unions on and off campus, they will 
significantly increase their bargain-
ing power. I hope none r;>f the read-
ers that read Mr. Wu's article were 
convinced that the TA union 's 
actions were "ludicrous." The TA 
union stood up for a valuable right 
and they should get the respect 
they deserve.

Jobs are priority to CA 
G· ov. Arnold Schwa rzenegger's State of the State 
address onJan. 6 served as a 
primer for upcoming policy 
decisions that will be set-
tled in the January budget 
revision and the March pri-
mary's ballot initiatives. 

Schwarzenegger has 
already worked diligently to 
assess Cauforrua's economic 
situation and compose solu-
tions. While the fruits of 
those accomplishments were 
discussed, the toughest deci-
sions for Schwarzenegger to 
make will have to be spelled 
out later this week In his 
budget proposal. 

When speaking about 
higher education, 

chwarzenegger admirably 
delivered a pran to cap stu-
dent fee increases at 10 p(!r-
cent per year year after UC 
students saw a devastating 
30 percent hike in the last 
12 months. But while the 
gove rnor works to keep 
California's public colleges 
affordable, fie must recog-
nize that the quality of 
instruction and research at 
the University of California 
must not be diminished 
further than the $1 billion-

plus already slashed from a 
crucial engine of the state's 
economy. 

Restoring the economy, 
Schwarzenegger said, was 
his utmost priority. His plans 
to reform the atrocious 
worker's compensation laws 
and lobby businesses 
throughout the world to 
come to California are right 
on. However, he should also 
use his action-star clout in 
Washington to chime in on 
free traae agreements that 
have sent jobs across borders 
and overseas - especially 
high-tech positions in 
Silicon Valley that were once 
a cornerstone of the state's 
tax base and have recently 
been treated as exportable 
commodities. 

Further, decentralizing 
K-12 education will devas-
tate the funding of already 
impoverished rural and 
inner city schools, leaving 
California's young people 
more unprepared for an 
increasingly competitive 
job market. 

Schwarzenegger must 
address these issues in the 
coming months if he wants 
to guiae the state back to 
prosperity. 

Misguided provision up 
for round of redraft 

W ith the Higher Education Act up 
for reauthorization 

this year, lawmakers have a 
chance to repeal the mis-
guided 1998 provision that 
denies federal financial aid 
to students with prior drug 
convictions. The provision, 
which asks students on the 
Free Application for Federal 
Student Aid if they have 
ever been convicted of "seil-
ing or possessing drugs," has 
resulted in thousands of 
denied grants and loans over 
the last five years. 

Drafted in the crime and 
punishment spirit of the 
War on Drugs, the provision 
isnores the fact that educa-
tIOn is perhaps the most 
effective deterrent to dru~ 
abuse. Since the provisions 
inception, over 100 student 
governments have voiced 
oppo ition, while several 
universities have nobly 
pledged to reimburse stu-
dents who were denied aid 
because of a drug offense. 

Penalizing students for a 
conviction mat they have 
already settled in court is 
erroneous and ineffective. 
Not only does the law pun-
ish students for the same 
offense twice, it hinges 
financial aid on a number of 
ulterior socioeconomic fac-
tors well beyond the scope of 
academia - namely, who is 
arrested on drug charges. 

Despite improvement 
since the 1990s, the rate of 
black juveniles arrested for 
drugs remained almost 
twice that of white juveniles 
in 2001, according to the 
Office of Juvenile Justice 
and Delinquenty

As President Jimmy 
Carter told Congress in

vidual than the use of the

It's actually a lot of fun if 
you're nOt too worried or serious 
about getting studying done. 
Around midnight, the CLICS 
staff hands out free coffee, and 
there is still a steady buzz of con-
versation into the wee hours of 
the night. 

Anyone who complains about 
the dearth of social activity at 
UCSD obviously never has been 
to CLICS during finals week. The 
craziness and sheer energy of the 
place is entirely representative of 
UCSD. Frenzied studying, late 
night hours and friends make a 
combustible elixir only finals we'Mc 
can whip up. 

Most students will have gone 
through a t least 12 rounds of finals 
before graduation - the groaning 
will never cease, and the end of the 
week will always be cause for cele-
bration. I don't like finals either. 
But sometimes, only in the midst 
of the most detestable times do the 
least detestable aspects become 
clear.

that the right to strike for other 
unions (sympathy strikes) is a ludi-
crous demand that is inconsequen-
t.ial when compared to wages , 
health care and working condi-
tions. However, has the author 
considered where these rights come 
from? 

Sympathy strikes encourage col -
laboration between unions to bar-
gain collectively for improved 
wages, health care and working 
conditions. Without the right to 
have sympathy strikes, the student 
union will never get cooperation 
from the other unions on campus. 
If the university succeeds in elimi-
nating sympathy strikes from all 
unions on campus, the university 
will have effectively broken the 
unions' collective bargaining 
power. 

The TA union has set an excel-
lent example by standing up for 
their right to bargain collectively, 
and I hope that other unions on 
campus will follow suit. If the stu-
dent union can make mutual pro-
tection agreements with other 
unions on and off campus, they will 
significantly increase their bargain-
ing power. I hope none of.the read-
ers that read Mr. Wu's article were 
convinced that the TA union's 
actions were "ludicrous." The TA 
union stood up for a valuable right 
and they should get the respect 
they deserve.

6 OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, JANUARY 8, 2004 

Condemnation of homosexual marriages cluttered 
with outdated stereotypes, hypocriticar assumptions 

By MARIANNE MADDEN Statistics estimates, for example, 
Senior Staff Writer that between 43 and 50 percent of 

. Last month, the justices of the 
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial 
Court rul ed that their sta te cannot 
deny the right of homosexuals to 
marry, and gave the Massachusetts 
Legislature six months to take the 
necessary steps to effectuate the 
ruling. Massachusetts joins 
Ontario, British Columbia, 
Belgium and the Netherlands in 
legalizing gay marriage. Similarly, 
Vermont recognizes homosexual 
unions, and many other states and 
countries, including California, 
are quickly moving toward more 
equal treatment of heterosexual 
and homosexual relationships. 

In other words, a revolution is 
nigh - a purple-clad, hair-gelled, 
designer-clothed revolution. And 
it's fabulous. So much so that 
America can barely control the fab-
ulousness. Naturally, members of 
the American right wing have 
quickly set down their Bibles and 
raised both fists to fight the deci-
sion. 

Let's be frank. When it comes 
to homosexuals, American lawmak-
ers generally have the mindset of 
13-year-old boys. They're blinded 
by their extreme, oppressive het-
erosexuality, and thus have trouble 
realizing that homosexuals exist. 
When they acknowledge gays and 
lesbians, it's usually a backhanded 
insult - the equivalent of that 13 -
year-old boy whispering "sissy" to a 
hated classmate in a middle school 
hallway. 

President Bush, for example, 
has reached into his grab bag of 
rhetoric and buzzwords, condemn-
ing the decision in Massachusetts 
on the grounds that allowing 
homosexual marriage would 
destroy "the sanctity of marriage." 
However, he's ignoring a small but 
crucial detail: Marriage has no 
sanctity in the first place. The 
National Center for Health 

couples divorce within 15 years of 
being married, and this percentage 
rises with the number of years after 
the wedding. And in the book "The 
Monogamy Myth," Peggy Vaughn 
writes, "Conservative estimates are 
that 60 percent of men and 40 per-
cent of women will have an extra-
marital affair." 

So, in principle, marriage is all 
fine and dandy and lifelong, but in 
reality, Americans are subverting 
th.e whole purpose of marriage by 
cheating on their spouses and get-
ting divorced. Yet President Bush 
defends the supposed "sanctity" of 
the insti tution from homosexuals 
who will somehow hun these dys-
functional, failing heterosexual 
marriages by having weddings of 
their own. He must be living in a 
fantasy land. 

If heterosexuals are allowed to 
have tacky weddings, sordid extra-
marital affairs and angry, expen-
sive divorces, then homosexuals 
should too. Or, as gay columnist 
Dan Savage quips, "Considering 
how miserable weddings seem to 
make straight people - the work, 
the expense, the seemingly 
inevitable conflicts with your par-
ents, the 50 percent chance of a 
divorce - shouldn't people who 
don't like gay people want us to 
get married, just to make us mis-
erable?" 

If Bush and other conservatives 
are truly concerned with protecting 
"the sanctity of marriage," they 
should work toward outlawing 
divorce and making infidelity ille-
gal. After aU, there are no grea ter 
attacks on the spirit of marriage 
than outright failure of the rela-
tionship or cheating on one's 
spouse. 

Yet they're not condemning 
divorce and infidelity, they' re 
condemni ng homosexuals for 
their perceived threat to tradi-
tional unions . In reality, these 

Retail 

attacks on the marriage rights of 
homosexuals come down to sim-
ple homophobia, and Bush and 
other conservatives are simply 
hiding their bigotry and igno-
rance under a veil of fundamental-
ist Christianity and "protecting 
the sanctity of marriage." Hate is 
hate, even if it's cloaked in 
rhetoric or Christianity. 

Furthermore, homosexual 
relationships will never disappear, 
so America might as well 
acknowledge them. And while 
we're at it, we should learn to 

" The road to heU is surely 
not paved with 

homosexual marriages, so 
let's stop acting like it is. 

We need more committed 
relationships', not the 

condemnation of some of 
these latianshi " re PS .. . 

appreciate diversity and learn a 
little lesson about love and alter-
native lifestyles. As evidenced by 
shows like Bravo's "Queer Eye for 
the Straight Guy," America is 
learning to acknowledge that gay 
men happen to have an unflap-
pable sense of style. It's only nat-
ural that we now learn that these 
same stylish gay men fall in love 
and want to get married, just like 
heterosexuals. 

A ban on homosexual unions 
makes marriage, .. as recognized by 
law, a discriminatory institution 
dictated by hate and homophobia 
instead of love and commitment, as 
it's supposed to be. It makes mar-
riage irrelevant to an increasingly 
powerful group of Americans. It 

bastardizes the idea of a loving, 
lifelong union by saying that life-
long, loving unions are wholly 
dependent on the ability to breed. 

Yes, breeding. From a practical 
standpoint, marriage is simply a 
social institution put in place to 
channel our biological impulses 
into producing copious numbers of 
children raised by two parents in a 
stable environment. Implicidy, love 
is merely the icing on the cake, as 
children are the real cement of, and 
reason for, marriage. 

Many heterosexual married 
couples would rightfully take 
offense to this interpretation of 
their union, of course. "We didn't 
marry each other to breed like rab-
bits," they'd say. "We love each 
other, and we wanted to have our 
love recognized by the law, 
announced to everybody, irnmor-
tali zed on paper." Exactly - that's 
what gays and lesbians do, too. 
Marriage as a heterosexuality-
based baby-making machine is out-
dated, narrow, and, in today's 
world, extremely insulting. 

When Bush says that the only 
proper marriage is between one 
man and one woman, he's very 
clearly viewing marriage as an 
institution put forth to promote 
procreation. In this view, all mar-
ried couples should be required to 
have children, and the increasing 
number of childless marriages is 
shameful and destroys the sanctity 
of marriage. 

When Sen. Rick Santorum (R -
Pa.) said that "every civilization 
since the beginning of man has 
recognized the need to protect 
marriage as the union of one man 
and one woman," he conveniently 
ignored Ontario, British 
Columbia, the Netherlands and 
Belgium, where gay marriages are 
legal, and Vermont, which recog-
nizes civil unions. Have any of 
these societies collapsed from 
their terrible indiscretion? 
Hardly, and the Iud."}' homosexu-

als in these places must be thrilled 
that their governments recognize 
their committed relationships. 

In accordance with Santorum's 
-view, Bush talks of introducing a 
constitutional amendment to for-
ever restrict marriage to heterosex-
ual couples. Tamara Fraser writes 
on Salon.com, "This would be the 
first constitutional amendment that 
denies rights, rather than grants 
them." 

So Bush, as the leader of a coun-
try that prides itself on being fair 
and open, is aching to change the 
Constitution to restrict citizens' 
rights based solely on their seXuali-
ty. Is that the equality and freedom 
that our founding fathers envi-
sioned? 

Conservative gay pundit 
Andrew Sullivan invoked hoth reli-
gion and the civil rights struggle 
when he wrote in response to the 
Massachusetts decision, "Thank 
God Almighty, we are free at last!" 
As virtually the only gay-friendly 
conservative around, he's in a 
strange place right now - and so 
are all of America's gays. Will more 
favorable decisions follow the 
Massachusetts ruling, or will our 
country retreat back to the security 
and ease of narrowness, homopho-
bia, fundamentalist Christi~nity, 
and "protecting the sanctity of 
marriage?" 

The road to hell is surely not 
paved with homosexual marriages, 
so let's stop acting like it is. We 
need more committed relation-
ships, not the condemnation of 
some of these relationships 
because they occur between mem-
bers of the same sex. Not only gay 
Americans, but all Americans 
should be cheered by the decision 
in Massachusetts - when our soci-
ety is more free , open, and accept-
ing of those who don't fit the 
norm, everyone lSenefits, even 
President Bush and his conserva-
tive cronies.

Initially, the new resmCDons

the National Institutes of Health,

Though in agreement that more

entists rather than government

"In general, our feeling is that any

California, a division of the 
California Public Interest Research 
Group. "We totally support the 
University of California for getting

a lot of the basics in terms of training

would say that, by and large, they are 
doing a good job of leading the uni-

The programs aim to reduce the 
universities' energy burden by 
more than 2.5 Megawatts of peak 
electrical demand and 15 million 
Kilowatt-hours per year, in addi-

by over 700,000 therms per year. 
No projection for the potential 
monetary savings for the universi-

the Board of Regents' policy, 
UCSD has recently completed the 
installation of nine solar-powered 
lighting units at shuttle stops and 
selected places on campus, with the 
possibility of adding more if the 
program is successful. In addition 
to ~~~ energy, the use of solar-

the laying of expensive power lines, 
reduces co~truction costs.

partnership that will not only 
reduce energy consumption, but 
also gets the important eneTJY effi-
ciency message out to 33 campuses 

of the UC and CSU systems,"

Kennedy said. "I am delighted to 
see the UC and CSU systems 
working with the utilities to reduce 
California's energy consumption."

Smoking: Some smokers inconvienced 
continued from poge J 

the California Department of 
Health Services. "But businesses 
can get signage for all the appro-
priate areas through our local 
tobacco control program." 

The smoking policy applies to 
all UCSD-owned or leased facili-
ties According to the university's 
smoke-free policy, the only 
exceptions are for "covered park-
ing lots" and "private space" as 
well as the UCSD Medical 
Center's private rooms where 
patients have written permission 
from physicians to smoke. Some 
students have expressed frustra-
tion regarding the extended 
zone. 

"I think it's unfair for smokers 
because the smoking restrictions 
were already tight," Thurgood 
Marshall College sophomore Jaw-
Xin Wang said. "We can't really 
smoke in bars anymore, and now, 
we have to be in the middle of 
nowhere to smoke." 

According to Wellman-
Benson, the policy was designed 
to protect non-smokers from sec-
ondhand smoke. According to the 
Department of Health Services, 
secondhand smoke exposure has 
been shown to be the cause of 
4,700 deaths annually in 
Cali fornia. 

"The changes were made to 
protect the health of non-smok-
ers and those with health-related 
problems relating to the inhala-
tion and ingestion of secondhand 
smoke," said Vargas' legislative 
analyst Ermelinda Ruiz. "This 
bill was introduced to preserve 
the health of non-smokers, who 
oftentimes have to walk through 
a cloud of smoke as they are 
entering or exiting a public build-
ing." 

With the new law in effect, res-

identiallife offices are working on 
informing students about the 
changes and other implementa-
tion procedures. 

"We have always complied 
with state law in regards to local 
policies for on-campus living," 
Eleanor Roosevelt College 
Resident Dean Rey Guerrero said. 
"We wiU be updating our policy 
handbook to reflect the change, as 
well as having RAs do reminders 
to their residents regarding the 
change in the law in upcoming 
newsletters. " 

" We am't really smoke in 
bars anymore, and 

now, we have to be in 
the middle of nowhere to 

smoke." 

Likewise, John Muir College 
will be informing residents about 
the extension of smoke-free zones. 

"We will instruct our residen-
tiallife staff in the parameters of 
the new policy, and they will 
enforce the policy," Muir 
College Resident Dean Pat 
Danylyshyn-Adams said. "We 
will ask our house advisers to 
inform their residents, particu-
larly the ones who smoke, and 
then probably implement some 
length of grace period while the 
word gets out." 

According to 
Marshall College 
Resident Dean 

Thurgood 
AssistaDt 

Mitchelle 

Greenlee, TMC Residential Life 
has applied the law to each build-
ing because of the multiple 
entrances, staircases and patio 
ways. 

"We have not had one single 
problem with implementing this 
policy," Greenlee sa id. "Some 
students ask where they can 
smoke, and we have a nice, out-
door, unofficially designated area 
near the TMC hump where peo-
ple gather to smoke. Very few 
people have ever violated the pol-
icy." 

Some students who smoke are 
not worried about the changes. 

"It's not like they're enforcing 
it," John Muir College junior 
Humberto Ortega said. "It doesn't 
really matter. People smoking 
don't really smoke five or whatev-
er feet away from doorways, but 
most smokers are courteous 
enough to walk away from every-
one else." 

Others expressed that the 
changes could be a difficulty. 

"It is an inconvenience because 
I tend to smoke a cigarette right 
when I leave a building or right 
before I enter a building," 
Marshall College sophomore 
Rebecca Chou said. "Usually 20 
feet from a building, I would be 
standing on the street already. So I 
really don't know where I would 
smoke now." 

According to Well man-
Benson, there have been mostly 
positive reactions from the com-
munity. 

"Most of the reactions have 
been in compliance," Wellman-
Benson said. "We have received 
calls from agencies requesting sig-
nage. There are a lot of people not 
excited but still complian t, and 
they realize that the measure will 
protect California."

I s it just me, or are there more end-of-the-year lists this year than ever in history? These lists are more ubiquitous than Paris 
Hilton and are only slightly less annoying. 
People can't get enough of them though, so 
we've decided to run the results of an enter-
tainment survey given to members of the 
GUIlrdiall, KSDT and the Hip-Hop Club. 

The results? There were some surprises. 
Independent films and music were more than 
amply represented, a tribute to a good year 
for both fields. Of course, there were plenty 
of obvious choices. "Lord of the Rings" and 
"Pirates of the Caribbean" ruled the film cat-
egory while the White Stripes, OutKast, the 
Strokes and Queens of the Stone Age ruled 
music. The Guardian would like to thank 
everyone who contributed. Here it is, the 
umpteenth end-of-the-year list. 

Best Films 
1. "The lord of the Rings: The Return of 
the King" 

Frodo and company try to destroy the 
great ring of power in Mordor before it 
brings Middle Earth to ruin. The question is: 
Does anyone care? Yes' An overwhelming 
majority voted for the third installment of 
the series as the best film of the year. As the 
film rakes in the cash and nabs more award 
nominations than Norah Jones at Grammy 
time, this won't be the last time the film is 
recognized as the best of the year.

The second fantasy flick with two titles on 
the list is the people's second-favorite film of 
the year. Critics weren't impressed with the

Song after song, the White Stripes' 
Elephllnt proved to be the year's most consis-
tently excellent rock record. It should be ille-
gal for a band to put out so many great 
records in so short a time, but this one, full of 
subtle wordplay and big mean' hooks, is the 
best of all. 

2. The Strokes - Room on Fire 
Say what you want about the Strokes, but 

the music speaks for 
itself. The Strokes 
released a sister record 
to Is This It? in terms of 
its minimalistic 
approach, but the 
deceptively well-con-
sidered sound of the 
album sets each song into overdrive. 

3. The Postal Service - Give Up 
Ben Gibbard of Death Cab for Cutie 

and Jimmy 
Tamborello of Dntel

up on this pretty 
album of romantic 
synth-pop. Let's hope 
they keep it going.

Back off Nemo: 'The Triplets of 
Belleville' is an animated sensation 
Twisted French cartoon comedy proves that animation 
is is still alive and kicking in this likely Oscar contender 

By BRIAN UIGA 
Staff Writer 

At the risk of sounding like a decompos-ing old man reminiscing of times past, this has to be said: They don't make ani-
mated films like they used to. 

The neat little parlor trick of moving 
drawings hit its peak with Disney's 
"Fantasia," a film that was designed to be 
more than JUSt a film - it was a night out at 
the opera. Yet now, Disney somehow turned 
its artistic aspirations on its head after Walt 
kicked the bucket and decided to comer the 
animated film market by regurgitating sappy 
story after sappy story, with plenty of bonk-
ing sound effects to keep the kids happy. 
Such is the current state of the animated film. 

That is, until now, when independent 
French wonder "The Triplets of Belleville" 
burst onto the scene. After a short faux old-
time black-and-white interlude that serves as 
an introduction to the film, the audience is 
suddenly thrust into the world of the 
grotesque and the ride begins. 

Silly yet wiclcedly savage caricatures waddle 
to and fro, inviting laughter from their very 
lines and movements. This is why animated 
films were made in the first place. Never mind 
the wishy-washy realism of correctly propor-
tioned people dancing around with genies, 
wolf-men or talking animals, this film skews 
every shape to the point where you don't know 
whether to be sick or in awe of the beautiful 
animation. 

Of course, such an artistic approach to a 
film would easily banish it to hopeless preten-
sion if not for one thing: The characters are 
real people. Vulnerable people. Like another 
recent French success, "Amelie," the depth of 
feeling that each character portrays easily 
transcends their silly quirks. In "Amelie," the 
audience comes to care for the daydreaming 
fool, her voyeur boyfriend, the one-armed 
neighbor and the foul-mouthed bar patron. 

Film 
REVIEW 

Likewise, in "Triplets of Belleville," the 
audience learns to care a bout the old lady 
with a lazy eye and one very large boot as she 
searches for her grandson who has calves the 
size of hay bales and runs from trapezoidal 
mobsters aided by sagging old ladies. There's 
a fat, stupid dog in there too, who has lush 
computer-generated nightmares, and we 
even care about him. 

Some people may not like the fact that 
this film has no dialogue. Perhaps it's time for 
a bit of peace and quiet. 

Some people may not like the fact that 
this film portrays Americans as hamburger-
chomping farcies who have the intelligence of 
deranged sheep. Perhaps it's time for a crash 
course in international relations. 

Some people may not like the fact that 
this film is really "G" rated, hiding behind a 
ten-second breast shot for its coveted PG-13 
rati ng. Perhaps it's time to realize that before 
the Disneyfication of kiddie films, it was okay 
to go see "G" films. 

And some people may not like the film at 
all - they may say it's too artsy and too sim-
ple at the same time. But that's okay. We've 
been settling for bad stories for years, but at 
least this one will enrich our dreams, espe-
cially for those who stay past the end of the 
credits.

10 HIATUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Forget 'Friends,' embrace reality TV 
short kids 
are cool 

I 

Mara Evans 

Hello my name is Mara and I am a reality television addict. 
I don 't remember when 

my fi xa tion started, but it proba-
bly was somewhere around the 
time my mother decided that 
MTV's "Real World" was too 
trashy. Ever since, I've been 
unable to stop my habit and the 
number of shows I've needed to 
satis fy my cravings has multi-
plied . Call me crazy, but I fail to 
see this as an illness. 

While my mother, as a kid, 
stayed up late to watch the "Ed 
Sullivan'Show," I dutifully sit and 
watch Jeff Provost say to another 
shabby contestant, "I'm sorry, 
the tribe has spoken." I see reali -
ty television as the television of 
my generation . Some might 
argue that the early episodes of 
"Fr iends" or "Seinfeld" are what 
we should cherish, but years after 
the reruns, we'll really only 
remember the "Rachel haircut" 
and Seinfeld's inability to keep a 
straight face. Where's the fun in 
that? 

It seems to me that pop cul-
ture, li ke a really bad mullet, is 
desti ned to come back and haunt 
you. Along those lines, reality 
televis ion is a perfect nightmare 
and one that I have chosen to 
embrace. In fact, to be more spe-
ci fic about my addiction, I'd like 
to expand my impulses to include 

"un-scripted television" with all 
its glory of decorating, makeover 
and cooking shows. I can watch 
neighbors let a rowdy carpenter 
pound holes in each other's 
homes, then click over to watch 
Emeril fill a frozen watermelon 
with vodka to make some inex-
plicable mixed drink. Honestly, 
what more could a girl ask for? 

She could ask for : the Fab 
Five, the stars of Bravo's "Queer 
Eye for the Straight Guy." They 
are, hands down, God's gift to 

. television, reality-based or other-
wise. Addict or not, everyone 
should sit for an hour and watch 
Carson prance across the screen 
and study how Kyan helps a very 
heterosexual cowboy feel com-
fortable enough to have a mani-
cure and pedicure. You will even 
find yourself moaning with the 
rest of the five as they lament 
straight men's habit of "speed 
shaving" (seriously guys, cut that 
out, because it looks more dan-
gerous than a bikini wax). 

That's just the tip of the ice-
berg when it comes to my addic-
tion. But there are other reasons 
why my fetish is justified. 
Watching all these not-sa-aver-
age Joes and Janes be unimagin-
ably stupid on national television 
makes me feel pretty damn good 
about myself. I know for a fact 
that I would never fall into hys-
terics over not getting a rose; and 
trust me, $50,000 is not nearly 
enough to get me to eat rat 
innards. 

Yet, through my arrogance, I 
must admit that there are times 
when I see small slivers of myself 
in these people who revel in their 
15 minutes of fame.

Take Jessica Simpson, for 
example. She is no Rhodes 
Scholar; in fact, tell her that and 
she might answer, "Are they, like, 
experts on making highways?" 
But honestly folks, we all have a 
little Jessica in us . Just the other 
day I asked my boyfriend if he 
liked Napoleon ice cream. When 
he looked perplexed, I said, "You 
know, it has chocolate, strawber-
ry and vanilla." After he was 
done with his belly laugh he said, 
"It's Neapolitan ice cream!" 

So why is reality TV so great? 
Because Jessica Simpson will go 
down in history for thinking buf-
faloes have wings, and because 
her reality will never be truly 
real. Perhaps that takes away 
some of the guilt as I sit and 
watch a two-hour wedding of 
people I've never even met. 
What I watch does not come 
close to resembling reality. 
There is no way that every time a 
new show goes on air, the pro-
ducers manage to get the same 
cast of characters in a totalJ,y new 
batch of people. Statistically, I 
like to think that the demograph-
ics of America are not 50 bitchy 
or macho to let that happen. 

Deep down the reasons I 
watch reality television are very 
feeble . After all, it's nearly 
impossible to fall madly in love 
in three weeks, but on reality 
television it happens a/l the rime! 
And how else can you strike it 
rich for starving yourself for 30 
days and be conniving at the 
same time? So really, I'm an 
addict to anti-reality television 
- and whenever "Queer Eye" 
happens to be on, that's the best 
time to watch.

Shows: More of San Diego's 
best live shows in 2003 

cOIltinued from page 9 

Best Live 
Shows 
1. WinterFest 

Featuring Del Tha Funky 
Homosapien, Rye Coalition and 
others, last year's WmterFest was the 
favorite show of the year. Most cited 
headliners Queens of the Stone Age, 
one of the best live acts on the plan-
et, as their reason for voting 

1. Street Scene 
The annual three-day beer and 

music festival had its share of ups 
and downs, but was ultimately a 
highly memorable musical event. 
The highlight: electric back-to-
back sets by Wilco and R.EM. 

3. The Falnt/Les Savy Fav - Th. 
Scene 

The favorite indie show of the 
year came from synth revivalists the 
Faint and erratic rockers Les Savy 
Fav. Sure, there are skinny indie kids 
dancing, but there's also great music. 

4. Tori Amos - SDSU Open Air 
Theatre 

Tori Amos' fanatical fanbase 
came out in droves to see the 
flame-headed siren hump her piano 
and sing about fairies and oral sex. 
Some fans have taken to wearing 
wings at shows. 

5. White Strlp.s - RIMAC 
Arena/Soma 

The White Stripes played two 
amazing shows in San Diego in 2003, 
the first with the also spectacular 

Yeah Yeah Yeahs at RIMAC Arena 
and the second at Soma. Thank you, 
Jack, may we have another? 

6. F1ami"l Lips - 4th ,; B/Coors 
Amphltheetre 

A bizarre spectacle of confetti, 
balloons, blood and animal cos-
tumes greets fans at the Flaming 
Lips' notorious live shows. Buried 
underneath the visual attack is 
stunning experimental pop music. 

7. Phantom Planet - The Scene 
They may have lost celebrity 

drummer Jason Schwanzman, but -
Phantom Planet presses on, singing 
pretty pop tunes to the delight of 
many a swooning girl. The band 
has enjoyed renewed success from 
its song "California" as heard in the 
opening of the television show 
"The O.c." 

•• Redloh.ad Coors 
Amphitheatre 

It's a strange thing how 
Radiohead's brainy electro-rock 
translates so well to large ve~ues, 
but Radiohead's San Diego show 
displayed the band's skill at making 
their experiments work wonders in 
a live setting.

14 SPORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, JANUARY 8, 2004 

Shum, Davey named to 2003 All-America First Team 
UCSD men's soccer is one of three teams to have two players honored 
ByANU KUMAR 

Associate Sports Editor 

Senior co-captain and defender 
Jonathan Shum and sophomore 
midfielder Matthew Davey of the 
UCSD men's soccer team were 
each named to the National Soccer 
Coaches Association of 
AmericalAdidas 2003 Division II 
All-America First Team on Jan. 6. 

The duo helped lead the Tritons 
to their first ever NCAA Division II 
postseason appearance in 2003. 
UCSD, which led the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association for 
most of the regular season, earned a 
wild-card berth in the conference 
playoffs, where they upset four-time 
de fending champion Cal State 
Dominguez Hills, 2-1, in the semifi-
nals before falling to Chico State in 
the CCAA final . 

Although UCSD lost in the 
conference championship, the 
Tritons were still given a berth into 

the Division II Championship, 
where they again were upended by 
eventual national runner-up Chico 
State in the Far West Regional 
Semifinal, 2-0, ending UCSD's sea-
son with an overall record of 11-7-
I. 

Shum started all 18 games that he 
played in, missing the Tritons' final 
contest of the season due to a one-
game suspension after receiving a 
red card in the CCAA Final. He 
anchored the UCSD defense, which 
allowed more than two goals in only 
three games this season and gave up 
an average of 1.6 scores per match. 

Starting every game for UCSD, 
Davey was the Tritons' leading 
scorer in 2003. He posted team 
bests in goals scored (eight) and 
assists (eight), and he was third on 
shots attempted with 37. Two of 
the midfielder's eight goals were 
game winners. 

"It's kind of nice to see him get 
[the honor] in his sophomore year," 

UCSD head coach Derelt 
Armstrong said. "He's kind of get-
ting ahead of himself a little bit." 

Shum and Davey were among 
two other CCAA mens soccer play-
ers to be named to the II -man AlJ-
America First Team. Chico State's 
senior goalkeeper Dominic Jalcubelt 
and junior midlielder Victor 
Guerrero of Cal State Dominguez 
Hills were the other two conference 
players to earn the distinction. 

East Stroudsburg University 
and Southern Illinois University-
Edwardsville were the only other 
instirutions to have twO players 
named on the First Team. 

"The fact that we had two mem-
bers of our team selected spealcs 
quite nicely for the program," 
Armstrong said . 

This marked the first time 
UCSD players earned All-America 
honors since forward Bobby 
Saadati earned a selection to the 
First Team in 2000. 

Basketball: UCSD ready 
to open long home stand 

Men's basketball at au DOmlncuU HiUs

continued from page J 6 
perate three-pointer for the 
Toros missed and the Tritons 
ecured the victory. 

Coaches and players were 
unavailable for comment at 
press time. 

With the win, UCSD 
improves to 3 -6 overall and 
moves to 3-1 in CCAA play, 
the best-ever league tart for 
the Tritons since joini ng the 
conference prior to the 2000-

01 season. UCSD is currently 
tied for third place in the con-
ference, one game behind Cal 
State San Bernardino and Cal 
Sta te Bakersfield. 

Up next for the Tritons is a 
tough four-game home stand, 
including games on Jan . 9 
against Cal Poly Pomona and 
Jan . 10 against Cal State San 
Bernardino. lip off for both 
contests is at 7:30 p.m. at

he ball has fa llen, and we're 
finally getting used to writing 
'''04'' on our checks. The year 

that aw the cleanest reputation in 
SPOrtS fall into legal trouble, the 
Cubs bobble a chance to play in the 
World Series, and a 14-year-old kid 
sign a major league contract has 
come to a close, and a new year has 
begun. 

While others predict what will 
happen in politics and movies, here 
is my shot to foresee some of the 
biggest stories that may come about 
in the world of sports in 2004: 

The Chargers end up playing in 
LA. and win. The Bolts turn their 
backs on the last section full of 
faithful fans that they have and 
decide to move up the 1-5 to the 
L.A. Coliseum, where they finally 
enjoy a winning season. 

The Expos end lip playing 162 road 
games. The team that is supposedly 
based in Montreal, but played less 
than 81 games there last season, 
will go on the longest road trip in 
major league history in 2004. 

Barry Bonds is found using 
steroids. A year after Sammy Sosa's 
"batting practice bat" exploded and 
left fans wondering if he cheated, 
baseball's other slugger will also 
have an asterisk next to his name in 
the record books for bulking up by 
u ing illegal substances. 

Kobe and the Lakers will regain 
their dominance in the lear;zte of crim-
inals. Although the Lakeshow will 
undoubtedly sputter into the play-
off, the purple and gold will go 16-
o after they decide that the postsea-
son is a good time to start caring 
about winning games. 

The BCS will again award the No.3 
ranked team. The system that is so 
good at stirring up controversy will 
once again manage to pit the No.2 
and No. 3 team in the country to 
play for the college football crown. If 
the Bowl Championship Series has-
n't worked yet, there is no reason to 
believe that the computers \vill find 
the true national champion next 
season. My solution? I think that 
title contenders like USC should 
aim for the No.3 ranking, and that 
way they will be sure of a trip to the 
final bowl game of the year. 

At least this past college football 
season didn't end in the real cham-
pion getting completely snubbed. 
Congranllations, Men of Troy for 
earning at least a piece of the title 
and making it very easy for every-
one in the nation to see that the 
BCS i a perfect example of what 
coll ege football should not use. 

But maybe the end of the col-
lege football season was a fitting 
close to 2003. Throughout the 
year, questions were asked about 
how young stars like Lebron James 
will fare as professionals, how legal 
troubles always surround athletes 
like the Portland Jailblazers, and if 
there should be one more game to 
find the true national champion. 
Hopefully we'll see orne of the 
onswen to these questions in...2.Q(M.

Tritons' winning streak hits six games 
Women's basketball beat Taros on the road, 63-49 

By STEPHEN VONDERACH 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's basket-
ball team continued its strong play 
on Jan. 3 with a 63-49 road victo-
ry over Cal State Dominguez 
Hills. This marked the sixth con-
secutive victory for the Tritons, a 
streak that started on Dec. 13 . 
The win pushed the team's record 
to 7-2 overall and 3 -I in the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association. Cal State Dominguez 
Hills dropped to 6-3 overall and 
2-2 in the conference. 

The Tritons started the game 
by scoring the first points. By half-
time, the Tritons had built a 32-20 
lead over the Toros. UCSD fresh-
man guard Leora Juster had 10 
points in the first half. She fin-
ished with a game-high 15 points. 

UCSD let the game slip at the 
beginning of the second half, 
when Cal State Dominguez Hills 
was able to tie the score at 42 with 
7 :41 remaining on the clock. The 
Tritons were able to recuperate, 
however, and they scored the next 
seven points and maintained a 
comfortable lead for the rest of the 
g"me.

Quick start: The Tritons, who started D-91ast season, are 7-2 overall and tied for first place in the california Collegiate 
Athletic Association. They will attempt to extend their winning streak to seven on Jan. 9 against cal Poly Pomona at RIMAe 
half," senior guard Ali Ginn 
said. "Instead of folding or giving 
up, we refocused and played 
strong the last seven minutes of 

play. Kim Buffum's two field 
goals right after our time out were 
key baskets to get our momentum 
back." 

Along with Juster's 15 points, 
freshman guard Buffum had 13, 
and center Margaret Johnson and 
forward Katie McGann, both 
juniors, contributed 12 and 10 
points, reSpectively. McGann and 
Johnson also led the team with 
rebounds, nine and eight, respec-
tively. Collectively, the Tritons 
made 21 of 25 free throws. 

T he well-balanced scoring 
came at the right time. The cur-
rent leading scorer on the Tritons 
this season, Ginn, was held to just 
seven points on l-of-9 shooting 
from the field. 

The Tritons' record after nine 
games last season was 0-9. UCSD 
women's basketball head coach 
Judy Malone attributes the signif-

icant turnaround to a more experi-
enced team. 

"The experience is starting to 
show and things are coming 
together," Malone said after 
UCSD's Jan. 2 win over Cal State 
Los Angeles. 

Another big factor in the 
Tritons' success has been obtain-
ing a rebounding edge. UCSD has 
been out-rebounded in just one 
game this season. The Tritons 
were slower to the boards in the 
first ga'me of the season, which 
they dropped to Seattle Pacific, 
89-57, on Nov. 21. Since then, the 
Tritons have had more rebounds 
than the opposing team in all eight 
of their games. The Jan. 3 game 
was no different, as UCSD had 45 
rebounds to Cal State Dominguez 
Hills' 30.

UCSD edges Cal State Dominguez Hills 
Men's basketball improves to 3-1 in CCAA; sits in· third place 

By MAn RYAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

Coming off a victory onJan. 2 
at Cal State Los Angeles, UCSD 
traveled to the Torodome in 
Carson, Calif., to play Cal State 
Dominguez Hills on Jan. 3 and 
pull out another win in a nail-
biter, 68-66, over its California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
opponent. 

Junior forward Brandon 
Franci and center Jesse Boyd 
each scored 19 points to lead the 
Tritons. Francis remained hot 
after scoring 18 points the night 
before in a win over the Golden 
Eagles. In addition to the perfor-
mances by Francis and Boyd, 
sophomore guard Matthew 
Sweany had 11 points , six 
rebounds and a team-high four 
assists for UCSD. 

The game was close through-
out with six ties in the first half, 
including a knotted halftime 
score of 33 -33. In the second half, 
neither team could secure greater 
than a two-point lead during the 
first 10 minutes, unti l a basket 

and foul by the Toros' Ryan 
Meilleur gave the home side a 51-
47 lead with 9:45 remaining. A 
couple of free throws gave Cal 
State Dominguez Hills a 53-47 
advantage, the Toros' largest lead 
of the night. 

Neither team could pull 
away, and the lead switched back 
and forth for almost the enti re 
rest of the game. 

Boyd made a three-point play 
to give the Tritons a 66-63 lead 
with I :34 left. A three-pointer 
by the Toros was nullified 
because a Cal State Dominguez 
Hills player called a timeout 
prior to the shot. However, with 
23 seconds left, Geovanny 
Aispuro of the Toros was fouled 
shooting a three-pointer and 
made all three of his free throws 
to once again tie the game. 

The Cal State Dominguez 
Hills free throws were quickly 
answered, however. Just seven 
seconds later, Boyd was fouled 
on a fie ld goal attempt and hit 
both of his free throws. A des-
