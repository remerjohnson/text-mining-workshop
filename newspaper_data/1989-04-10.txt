Soviet Scientist Talks on History, 
Future of Soviet Union in Space 

By CATHERINE DILLE 
Staff Writer 
Soviet Scientist Konstatin 

Gringauz spoke to UCSO stu-
dents and faculty about the his-
tory and future of the Soviet 
space program last Thursday. 

Chief of the Soviet Laboratory 
of Planetary and Interplanetary 
Pia ma Studies at the Space 
Research Institute, USS R 
Academy of Science, Gringauz 
has been involved with the Soviet 
pace program since the early days 

of Sputnik I. He was the recipient 
of the Lenin Prize in 1961 and last 
year he received the Cospar 
Award, for scientific achievement. 

Gringauz began his presenta-
tion of "The Soviet Space Pro-
gram: Past, Pre ent and Future" 
with a brief history of the space 
program in the USSR. 

Gringauzsaid 1903 marked the 
real beginning of the space pro-
gram when Konstantin Tsiol-
kovsky developed an early plan 
for a rocket spacecraft. For polit-
ical reason it wasn't until the late 
'30s that T iolkovsky's plans were 
realized when Sergei Korolyov 
developed the prototype that led 
to the launching of Sputnik I. 

"In the years after [World War 
II], our country was very poor. It 
was not easy to find money ... but 

it was necessary to have a defen e 
weapon, and 0 this poor country 
began to build rockets," Gringauz 
said, speaking on the political cir-
cumstances which lead to the 
development of the rocket. 

As the head of a radio com-
munication laboratory in the 
1950s, Gringauz developed a the-
ory concerning the frequency 
from which to broadcast the 
Sputnik's signal. He was called 
upon to make the final connec-
tions on the transmitter of that 
satellite as it waited on the launch-
pad . This gave Gringauz the dis-
tinction of being the last person to 
touch Sputnik I before it was 
launched in 1957. 

"y ou can imagine our feelings 
when, according to schedule, we 
heard the 'beep beep' of Sputnik's 
signal," he said . 

"Everywhere we went , we heard 
about the enormous success of 
Sputnik. It was the golden youth 
of our space program." 

Sputnik wa followed by a suc-
cession of Soviet space-flight suc-
cesses including the Lunik pro-
gram, which landed a spacecraft 
on the moon; Venerral 60, the 
first deep interplanetary probe; 
and Vostok, the first manned 
space-flight. 

Gringauz outlined the future of 

the Soviet pace program, in-
cluding everal launches planned 
for the early 1990s. The Interball 
program, planned for 1990, will 
combine the effort of 12 coun-
tries, including France, Au tria 
arid Canada. 

Gringauz also spoke of a space-
craft intended to study Mar , to 
be launched in 1994. It is hoped 
that this mission will provide 
information which could lead to a 
possible manned flight to Mars 
around 2015, Gringauz said. 

He spoke briefly about the 
Phobos space missions, the first 
of which was lost due to an error 
in command, and the second, 
launched in July, 1988, now con-
sidered lost because its signal i no 
longer being received. 

The Phobo mi sion wa not a 
complete failure, according to 
UCSO Professor of Electronic 
and Computer Engineering Asoka 
Mendis. "[Gringauz] showed us a 
lot of data from the Phobo . It 
wa not a failure from the point 
of viewof science. We learned a 
lot about space plasma , more 
than we ever knew before." 

Mendis, Gringauz' faculty host 
at UCSO, ays Gringauz's visit i 
due to a "longstanding collabora-
tion" between Mendis, Gringauz 
and everal other Sovjet scientist 
involved in Cometor Physic . 

Gringauz hosted Mendis in the 
US R when Hally's Comet pas ed 
over the Soviet Union. 

Shortly before departing from 
the oviet Union, Gringauz pub-
lished a critical article concerning 
the oviet pace program. Grin-
gauz said that "the main [ pace

The Guardian has interviewed virtually all the candidates for next year's A.S. 

offices; some candidates, however, declined to be interviewed. Excerpts from the 
candidate interviews can be found below (for president) and on pages 3-31 for other 
offices. The candidate interviews are presented in the order they appear on the ballot. 

Also in today's paper are Guardian endorsements of specific candidates and 
referenda (page 4). The A.S. Bulletin (pages 16-20) is a paid advertisement in which 
photos and short unedited candidates' statements appear. Polls will be open from 10

with that, there being absolutely 
no fun at this chool - com-
pletely dead as far as social life 
goe - the only thing we have 
going for this chool is fraternities. 

For those people who don't 
want to join. well there should be 
another outlet such a TGs, which 
we have right now. As far as prob-
lems in the future, if 1 get elected I 
can see everyone trying to impeach 
me as quickly as possible, but I'd 
hang out and serve my term and 
try to get things done. 
G: What would you try to get 
done?

need be . 
G:Are you expecting to be elected 
and actually do the job? 
W: To be honest, last year I ran 
completely as ajoke. but after see-
ing the result I received better 
than 10 percent of the vote. 

I figured , I inspired 10 percent 
of apathetic people to actually 
show up and vote. I feel I repres-
ent the majority of students on 
campu . I feel I represent them 
- the silent majority drunks on 
campus 1 guess you could call 
them.

multi-faceted issue, because you 
really have to think when you're 
electing candidates what direction 
you want the campus to go in . I 
think it is important that the small 
college feeling is maintained as we 
grow. I think ifit's not, people will 
become numbers and not people 
anymore. 
G: How do you plan to combat 
the potential impersonality of the 
campu? 
H: The whole basis for my cam-
paign lie in keeping in close con-
tact with the students. One way to 
do that is office hours which 1 
intend to have, but one step 
further i really going out and 
soliciting student opinion. 
G: How will you lead campus 
development to maintain a "small 
college feeling?" 
H: Continuing to add colleges as 
the University grows academically 
is important. . . They need to build 
more classrooms to accommodate 
more people and they need to 
keep small classes as well. 
G: How do you balance increased 
classroom construction with 
maintaining the environment? 
H: It's a matter of the kind of 
building you are doing and where 
you are doing it. They have been 
building a lot ofhard<ore research 
facilities which is great in that it 
attracts the top people. But, when 
a university takes a trend toward 
such hard<ore academics, it needs 
to keep in mind that the reason it 
is here is for education and for the 
students . It is not here purely as a 
research institution. 

So, we need to balance the 
amount of research facilities we 
are building with the amount of 
classroom facilities ... [We need to] 
make better use of current areas 
like parking. We are spreading all 
of the flat parking lots all over. 
I'm personally in favor of parking 
structures. I realize we are look-
ing at a little more cost, but even-
tually I think in overall campus 
development, eventually it's going 
to get [to the point where] we are 
going to need them. So why not 
start looking at them now before 

we destroy what we already have? 
G: Some of the other candidates 
running for the position have had 
actual A.S . experience. You 
haven't. How are you a better 
candidate or what qualities do 
you have that make up for your 
lack of Council experience? 
H: I see myself as a better candi-
date for not being involved . When 
you're in the system you start to 
think the way the system thinks. I 
believe you start to ettle for the 
talU quo. I think that is danger-

ous. 
You need to have new ideas and 

you need to have the drive to get 
things done. As an outsider, I 
have tho e fresh ideas and the 
drive to get that done. 
G: What are some specific issues 
A.S. President Maynard Dimmes-
dale has failed to address this year 
that will be on your agenda for 
next year? 
H: I guess I differ with Dimmes-
dale more on an ideological level 
than on a specific level. That's 
why 1 keep going back to the issue 
of tudents. 
Hobbs is a Muir College junior 
double majoring in political sci-
ence and hiSTory. 

Robison 
Continued from pace 1 
R: Something that I've heard 
about more and more as a real 
problem is the underrepresented 
students. I think that i a key 
problem ... What I'd like to see is 
TGs that are culturally aware, not 
just booking a bunch of reggae 
bands like was done this year, but 
actually coinciding things with 
M EChA celebrations, with Asian 
Awareness Week and things like 
that ... 

Another problem is the student 
rights thing. [A.S. Student Advo-
cate] Bard-Alan [Finlan) has done 
a 101 of work as far as just making 
people aware of what is going on. 
1 hear a lot, being in the office, 
about the administration not fol-
lowing any of their own regula-

tions and their not planning on 
followi ng them until they are 
called on it . . . it i going to take a 
legal counselor or lawyer to pre-
pare the legal documentation to 
call them on it. 
G: How do you plan to improve 
or solve these problems? 
R: [As for] underrcpresentation, 
by financially supporting program-
ming a nd trips like the [Asian 
Pacific Student Union] conference 
that is happening this week. 

As far as student rights go, it 
means setting asid e a portion of 
the budget for a lawyer or taking 
a chunk out for so me kind oflegal 
counsel. If that' what it takes 
then t ha t 's what it takes. I know 
the A .S . has been shot down for 
trying to do that before by the 
admi nistration, but I think it 's a 
chance we have to take. 
G: Are you willing to go to local, 
state, and federal government 
officials to help put pressure on 
the administration? 
R: The vice president-external and 
UCSA lobby - I feel their posi-
tion is to handle the legislative 
aspect of it. I feel my position is to 
handle the publicity aspect of it , 
in coordination with the public 
relations commissioner. I fee l that 
the local newspapers and TV sta-
tions are much more effective. 
Once things become high profile, 
things get changed . The Guardian 
has even helped that in certain 
instances. 
G: What is your stand on the 
amphitheater referendum ques-
tion? 
R: Personally, I think if the stu-
dents can afford it, it's a good 
idea. I think they'l more than get 
their money back, The only prob-
lem is that students this year and 
next may not see it. 
G: Is it a good idea for students to 
accept the administration's ulti-
matum that if we want an amphi-
theater, we alone have to pay for 
it? 
R: Well, [the administration] 
doesn't want it. I feel very confi-
dent in saying that if we put it to 
the administration, it will never 

happen .. . They were very, very 
reluctant even to help out with the 
intramural facility, which, to me, 
is their total responsibility. 
G: Are you saying that if the 
administ ration takes a firm stand 
on an issue, there is no way stu-
dents can a lter that position? 
R: The amphitheater is a fairly 
exceptional case, because if you 
think about the attitude of this 
University and the research orien-
tation, "what do we want an 
amphitheater for" is their attitude. 
There are a lot of other things that 
are much more flexible. 
G: What do you think of the Price 
Center? 
R: It 's the administration'S wet 
dream. It's the biggest, it 's the 
best, it's far more than we could 
ever need. It 's fa r less student-
oriented and far more administra-
tion-oriented. We didn't get our 
money's worth. 
G: Do you think the A.S. dropped 
the ball in making sure students 
got what they wanted? 
R: The fee was enacted years ago, 
and because the A.S. president is 
elected a nd the University Center 
Board chair is elected , there's not 
always continu ity there. In fact, . 
this year they have been almost 
diametrically opposed on a lot of 
issues. 

I don't know that the A.S. 
dropped the ball this year. I don't 
know if they ever had a chance to 
get the ball to begin with.

going to deal with? 
R: We need to have a safer cam-
pus. We need more lighting when 
you go from one college to 
another. 

The call boxes are not being 
used effectively. Not too many 
people know, besides the student 
leaders, that you can pick it up 
and call a CSO. It's really simple 
to fix ... and they will be used 
more effectively. Expansion of 
the shuttle system - they are not 
going to a lot of the parking lots. 
They plan to expand the shuttle 
systems in the future , but we need 
to [expand) it now. I think the 
money is there and we have to 
push it . In order to get these stu-
dent rights, you have to have a 
strong student voice. 
G: How do you propose to fund 
additional campus lighting? 
R: I think the funds are there. As 
president, my responsibility is to 
go to the chancellor and vice 
chancellor and make them change 
their priorities. 
G: What is your stand on the 
amphitheater referendum ques-
tion? 
R: If it passes we will have the 
money to say we want an amphi- . 
theater on campus. It gives the 
Council the opportunity to go up 
to the Regents and bypass the 
administration if they don't want 
it. .. then the students will be creat-
ing the future of UCSD. 
G: Is it the sole responsibility of 
students to fund anamphitheater? 
R: Students should be able to 
create the future of their com- . 
munity. I think the chancellor 
and the administration should 
listen to what we have to say. The 
first step is going to the adminis-
tration and hope they are going to 
take it ... but it sounds like they 
are not for it. If we want to get it 
implemented , we can't give it to 
the administration because they 
will drag it on. I do feel that stu-
dents have been taking the burden 
fi nancia lly and they haven't been 
listened to because we are not a 
strong student voice.

like a lot of people don't really 
care at all about school. I don't 
know what the A.S. can do about 
t hat, but they don't seem to be 
doing a whole lot about it, though. 
Parking is always a problem. 
G: In terms of student a pathy, 
how is your approach to this 
problem going to differ from the 
approaches of past A.S. presi-
dents? 
Z : I haven't seen a whole lot of 
contact between the A.S . a nd

be fairly simple. I have seen A.S. 
tables that say 'What a re we doing 

wrong?' and 'How can we help

Do you know if there is an A.S .

Z: I'm a little undecided on [that 
question]. I haven't weighed the 
pros and cons and I haven't really 
seen the pros and cons pointed 
out to me. But, it's a lot of extra 
money to be paying. On the other 
hand it makes a lot of sense 
because it would be a nice thing to 
have.

you feel A.S. President Maynard 
Dimmesdale has failed to address 
this year that will be on your 
agenda next year? 
Z: To be truthful, I missed the 
fir t quarter. I don't know that 
he's been getting along all that 
well with the A.S .... that could 
lead to a bit of friction. 
G: How would you work more 
closely with the Council to avoid 
friction? 
Z: You try harder. 
G: In what ways? 
Z: Well, how would you do it? 
G: I'm not running for the 
position.

more and make sure there is more 
understanding between your goals 
and theirs.

Guardian: What activities have 
you been involved with in the 
past, and how have these activi-
tie qualified you for the po ition 
(campus activities)? 
Wane: J think, most importantly, 
I've spent a year as Third College 
Senior Senator. I think one of the 
most important things for VP 
administ ration, since you're run-
ni ng Council meetings, is having 
experience in A.S. Cou ncil. 

I've been on Th ird College 
Council for a number of years; 
I've been involved with SAAC 
[Student Affirmative Action Com-
mittee] .... 

I've been active at UCSA, the 
UC stude nt association - I've 
spent two times lobbying for stu-
dent rights at the California state 
legislature. 

Very importantly,l was a final-
ist for Student Regent, and I 
think that reflects, to some degree, 
my knowledge and understand-
ing of issues pertaining to UCSD 
a nd the UC system, my leadership 
and administrative abi lities. 

I've also been on the Media 
Board; I was founder and editor 
of the UCSD Triton Yearbook. 

I've also been on the registra-

tion fees committee, which deter-
mines, basically, how yo ur regis-
tration fets are used . 
G: What would you identify as 
the two major problems which 
faced UCSD (and specifically the 
A.S.) this year, what problems do 
you anticipate arising next year, 
and how do you plan to solve 
those problems? 
W: Let me start off with one issue 
... that I don't think a lot of stu-
dent are familiar with, and that's 
La Casa. There is a dire need ... 
for space for students, for pro-
gramming, for all kinds of events; 
and here was a facility that was 
designed to meet the needs of stu-
dents, that had been paid for by 
student fees, and that was being 
taken away without any student 
input. I have worked on a com-
mittee to save La Casa, and I 
believe we have now done that. 

[Also) something which will 
continue to affect students . . . is 
the proposed referenda for a new 
rec facility complex. That is, in 
some ways, reflective of a grow-
ing problem on all the UC cam-
puses, which is campus-based fees. 

Future issues include commu-
ter students - the A.S. is sup-
posed to represent all student 
from UCS D, and unfortunately a 
lot of commuter students aren't 
being catered to; needs aren't 
being met. 
G,: What would you do to get 
quality people appointed to all of 
the various campu committee 
vacancie which the vice president 
- administrative is responsible 
for filling? 
W: I think step one in getting a 
diverse group of people who are 
also qualified is to do a lot of 
recruitment, is to put a lot more 
emphasis on getting the word out 
on what the jobs are , to get it out 
in plenty of time in advance, to 
get job descriptions out; and to 
make sure that these things go to 
the college councils, to the stu-
dent organization boxes and to 
various groups on campus. 

At Third College ... a lot of 
times you have 30 people apply 
for one position. Twenty-nine of 
those people don't get a position, 
[so] there are 29 people there who 
want to get involved ... those are 
people that you need to tap into 

G: How do you feel about how 
Council meetings have been run 
in the past , and what, if anything, 
would you do differently? 
W: The problems I've seen in the 
past are ... just a lot of political 
bickering and infighting, which is 
unfortunate ly sort of traditional 
with Council . . . as opposed to 
really remembering what they're 
there for, which is to represent the 
students and to vote in the stu-
dents' interests on an issue. 

How I'd like to see that differ-
ent, to begin with. I would like to 
pend a lot of time outside of 

Council meetings just getting 
Council together, getting people 
to work together ... so we can 
hopefully cut out some of the 

infighting that goes on. 
Secondly, I'd like to run it very, 

very professionally, in the [same) 
ense that the "real" Congress is 

run ; to let the meeting progress , 
but to really clamp down on peo-
ple who are speaking out-of-line . 
(Wong is a senior. majoring in 
political science at Third College.) 
CURTIS BOWDEN 
Vice President Administrative 

Guardian: What activities have 
you been involved with in the past 
and how have these activities 
qualified you for the position 
(specifically campus activities)? 
Bowden: I was the programmer 
for the A.S. film series, and had a 
lot of access to the A. S. offices. 
Also, I have been the co<hairman 
of the La Jolla Marathon relay 
race for two years now . ... 

I'm in the fraternity system; I 
was president of my fraternity a 
year ago, for one year; and also 
the president of the Interfrater-
nity Council ... . 

In the course of those twojobs, 
especially, I have honed the prac-
tical, mechanical, administrative 
skills that I think are absolutely 
vital and essential to this particu-
lar job . ... I can deal with all the 
different personalities that need 
to be catered to; solicit com prom-
ise and cooperation ... not alie-
nate people . . . . 
G: What would you identify as 
two major problems which have 
faced UCSD (specifically the AS) 
this year, and what problems do 
you anticipate arising next year? 
8: An issue I don't feel has been 
addre sed ... is the i sue of stu-
dent fees . I'd like to see the admin-

istration funding more of the cost 
for student-related buildings. For 
example, for a proposed 1M rec 
facility or a proposed amphi-
theater, it's ridiculous to ask stu-
dents to spend money on a quar-
terly basis for a specific building, 
when indeed the administration 
has access to outside sources of 
funding . ... 

I think that an embarrassment 
is the level of underrepresentation 
at this school; I think that the high 
fees are one contributor to that 
, . . . I'm talking about the failure 
ofthe administration, and in s,,"me 
sense the A.S. to make affirma-
tive action work at UCSD. 
G: How do you plan to improve 
or solve these problems? 
B: I would like to see the A.S. 
Council go out into the student 
population more - it's such a 
closed system. The appointments 
[to campus-wide committees] are 
mostly coming from a few student 
organizations, the college coun-
cils, and people already on the 
A.S. 

I think that the greatest un-
tapped resource on this campus is 
the student organizations. 
G: What would you do to get 
quality people appointed to all of 
the various campus committee 
vacancies which the vice president 
- administrative is responsible 
for filling? 
B: My solution is going out to the 
student organizations. Everything 
that is being done now is fine; but 
it's not enough. All of the tudent 
organizations have mailboxes ... 
and leaders with phone numbers. 
There's no problem with calling 
up, and saying "when are your

ENDORSEMENTS 

Endorsements are determined by the Editorial Board and do not necessarily 
reflect the views oj all Guardian slaff members. 

UCSD GUARDIAN Editorial Board 

LARA MIHATA

Opinion Editor 

ASUCSD Office Endorsements 
The Associated tudents can make 

a real difference in improving stu-
dents'lives. An active, organized A.S. 
is possible, just not easy to achieve. 

Fortunately, while this year's crop 
of candidates is most striking in its 
mediocrity, there are a few good can-
didates, and there is hope. 

President 
John Robison is an experienced, 

capable candidate. Unlike current 
President Mayna rd Dimmesdale, 
Robison is an insider. He knows the 
A.S., and will be able to transform his 
ideas into action. He was a Muir sena-
tor for two years, and performed ably 
as vice president ad mini trative. He 
wants to work on the problems of 
underrepresented minority groups, 
and will work to protect student rights . 
Hi firm grasp of the issue, and hi 
ability to articulate his goal, make 
him the clear choice. 

Robison understands that the 
administration' first priority is not 
students. His ability to unify the A.S. 
and force the administration to serve 
student needs will be crucial next year. 
We strongly endorse his candidacy. 

Vice President Administrative 
Alex Wong also has important 

experience in the A.S. As vice presi-
dent administrative he would chair 
the weekly meetings and manage the 
agenda. A thorough understanding of 
A.S. rules is necessary, as well as an 
ability to calmly deal with conflict. 
Wong has these skills. 

Vice President External 
Mishka Migacz has the lobbying 

experience to tap the resources out-
side of UCSD. She has effectively 
lobbied state senators before, and her 
experience at Mira Costa College as 
the vice president of policy and proce-
dure could be useful. She was the only 
one of the candidates for this position 
to offer solid ideas and options for 

bypassing the administration by going 
directly to local and state government. 
The VP external has an opportunity 
to change UCSD's low position in the 
UC pecking order, and Migacz pos-
sesses the ability to tackle this difficult 
change. 

Vice President Finance 
We found it impossible to make an 

endorsement here. None of these can-
didates have the experience and skills 
necessary for this complex and power-
ful position. They spoke in generali-
ties, and demonstrated that they didn't 
have a thorough understanding of the 
issues. Luis Ramirez seemed to have 
the best grasp of the position, but 
appears to not understand its inherent 
power. An endorsement means that 
we feel a candidate will do well in a 
position, and not be merely adequate. 
None of these candidates inspire that 
confidence. 

Academic Affairs Commissioner 
Aline C. Zirino is the sort of over-

achiever that thrives in the A.S. Her 
list of past activities and accomplish-
ments fills up a considerable amount 
of space in her interview, so there's no 
point in repeating them here . She was 
described by the editor who inter-
viewed her as a "powerhouse." We're 
confident that someone with even a 
fraction of her energy would do an 
excellent job in this post, so we endorse 
her whole-heartedly. 

Communications 
This is a tricky position. The New 

Indicator has a lawsuit pending against 
the A.S ., and conflict with other 
alternative media are almost inevita-
ble. (Incidentally, the Guardian is not 
funded by the A.S. - we are self-
sufficient - so we don't have a con-
flict of interest in picking this post.) 

Michael Holmes, who is running 
unopposed in this race, seems capa-
ble, but he lacks a clear vision of what

constitutes censorship. He makes 
vague references to cutting off fund-
ing to a publication if students oppose 
it, without clearly defining how he'l 
measure student opinion. We cannot 
endorse him. 

Public Relations 
Benny Singer has the energy and 

ideas this post demands . He'll be 
effective in attacking the perennial 
problem of student apathy. Moreover, 
he has the skills to reach out to the 
surrounding communities, which lar-
gely view UCSD as a nuisance. 

His opponents simply don't mea-
sure up . Allyson Gold has more expe-
rience, but we have doubts about her 
judgement (see the commentary else-
where on this page). Lisa Collins is 
motivated, but lacks experience and a 
real understanding of the scope of the 
position. Benny Singer is the best 
candidate. 

Programming 
We aren't endorsing a candidate for 

this office, but we feel a little nervous 
about this. Matthew T. Schnurer 
doesn't really have the experience or 
knowledge necessary for this job, but 
his opponent is so bad that we almost 
went ahead and endorsed Schnurer 
anyway. His opponent, Jim Valladao, 
is running as a joke. He's funny (in an 
unoriginal sort of way), but the 
thought of him actually winning is 
frightening since this post has such a 
direct effect on the quality of student 
life on campus. His apathy and goofi-
ness, which may inspire a grin as a 
candidate, would bring only frustra-
tion and stagnation if he actually won. 
A vote for a joke candidate, ulti-
mately, would be a joke on us. 
Operations, Services and Enterprises 

Jim Edwards was the best candi-
date. Not just in this position, but out 
of all the candidates for the posts. It's 

a pity he didn't aim his sights higher, 
but it is another example of his com-
petence that he decided to pick a more 
limited position than president, one 
where he could really have an effect 
and do the job right. His grasp of a 
wide variety of issues - especially the 
way he understands all sides, and isn't 
dogmatic - makes him the clear cho-
ice for this office. 

University Center Board 
Jason Carbone isn't an Evan Wei-

senfeld clone. He's sympathetic to co-
ops, aware of the complex issues the 
board will face, and his experience as 
the Muir representative to the board 
this year will serve him well. His 
opponent seems content with the sta-
tus quo, while Carbone is willing to 
tackle the conflicts which face the 
board as the Price Center finally nears 
completion. 

Poor Judgement 
Harms Campaign 

Being a ca~didate isn't easy, and 
candidates have to search for any 
edge they can. Unfortunately, this 
presents a strong temptation to find 
loopholes that are, while legal, beyond 
the bounds of ethical conduct. The 
information uncovered by the Guar-
dian suggests that AUyson Gold, a 
candidate for public relations com-
missioner, and her running mate Matt 
Lehrer, a candidate for academic 
affairs commissioner, succumbed to 
this temptation. 

The ASUCSD election bylaws 
allow single candidates to spend up to 
S 125 on their campaigns. If two can-

ASUCSD Senate Endorsements 
The specific endorsement ' appear 

elsewhere on this page. Being a sena-
tor isn't really much fun on the sur-
face. They all share one office, don't 
have many resources available to them, 
and have limited powers. But this only 
makes it imperative to find able sena-
tors; an ambitious, devoted senator 
can overcome the limitations of the 
post. But it isn't easy, and it requires 
real political skill. 

The main thing we looked at in 
selecting a candidate for senator was a 
firm grasp of issues specifics, not 
general goals such as "we need to get 
rid of Mudent apathy." ome senators 
were a lmost comical in their answer 
to our questions, such as Nic Speis ' 
offhand comment that "parking 
sucks." Even some of those who wer-
en't running unopposed offered super-

ficial answers that made us suspect 
they were merely looking to pad their 
resumes. 

There were a few standouts, how-
ever. David Wesley Bonds, who is 
running for Third College Senior 
Senator, has an understanding of the 
turbulent history of Third College, 
and will communicate well with his 
constituents. Jeffrey Shear, despite 
running unopposed for Warrenjunior 
senator, went to the trouble of gelling 
out and talking to students. Micki 
Winsett , a candidate for Muir College 
sophomore senator, stressed a grass 
roots, personal approach and didn't 
just bring up the same old issue . 
Many of the other candidates we 
endorse demonstrated the ambition to 
overcome the limitations of the office 
and tackle some tough problems. 

OPINION Monday, April 10. /989 S 

Referenda Question Endorsements 
The nine referenda on the 1989 

ASUCSD election ballot are indica-
tive of the increasing number of 
important issues facing UCSD as its 
growth continues to accelerate. 
Student Advocate 

This is an advisory vote on chang-
ing the student advocate post from an 
appointed to an elected position. The 
need for this change is demonstrated 
by the poor performance of some of 
the student advocates appointed by 
A.S. presidents in the past. This 
change will make the advocate more 
responsive to students. We support a 
YES vote. 
TGs 

TGs are a great idea. They're fun, 
and provide one of the few organized, 
tudent body-wide social activities. 

But there is no reason why free beer is 
necessary. It costs a great deal of 
money ($14,000 this year), and the 
21-year-old drinking age excludes a 
large portion of fee-paying students 
from obtaining beer they helped pay 
for. The money used to provide free 
beer could be spent on improved 
bands or used to expand underfunded 
services like A.S. Lecture Notes. Vote 
NO. 
Chancellor's Vote of Confidence 

Sure, it doesn't mean much. Atkin-
son isn't going to resign in disgrace if 
he loses this. Nevertheless, a "no" 
vote sends a signal that students are 
not happy with his priorities. Atkin-
son has shown that he is an effective 
administrator. But he's also shown 
that undergraduates aren't very high 
on his list of concerns. On issues rang-
ing from the amphitheater to parking 
to the Price Center, he has demon-
strated his lack of responsiveness to 
undergraduate student concerns. Vote 
NO. 
Constitutional Amendment 

Changing the constitution to allow 

Judgement 
Continued from pale 4 
didates form a slate, as Gold and 
Lehrer did, they are permitted to 
spend a total of $250 on their cam-
paigns. The members of the slate, 
however, do not have to spend equal 
amounts. 1n the case of Gold and 
Lehrer, Gold spent $245.49 and 
Lehrer spent nothing. This loophole 
effectively allowed Gold to spend 
twice as much as could an opponent 
running individually. Clearly, this 
gave Gold an unfair advantage. Her 
failure to recognize the ethical impli-
cations of her campaign strategy, 
casts serious doubts on her ability to 
make similar judgements in an A.S. 
post. 

Her selection of Matt Lehrer as her 
running mate is also indicative of her 
poor judgement. Lehrer appears to 
have no desire to actually win. He has . 
applied and been accepted to next 
year's Education Abroad Program in 
England. Additionally, his name has 
not appeared on any of his slate's 
campaign literature, nor has he taken 
advantage of available media cover-
age. 

It does not appear that Gold and 
Lehrer conspired to exploit the elec-
tion bylaws. And neither appear to 
have actually violated any campaign 
regulations. The loophole is well 
known to the people in the A.S., and 
has been used by candidates in past 
years. Gold is really only guilty of bad 
judgement - she admits she was 
"naive" - and the real tragedy is that 
the A.S. has failed to remedy this 

three campus activity fee or constitu-
tional amendment referenda to be 
placed on the ballot per year (instead 
of one per quarter) is a minor change, 
but one which increases flexibility. 
It's clear the current constitiution 
isn't adjusting well to UCSD's rapid 
growth, and this amendment offers a 
solution much less drastic (and risky) 
than calling a constitutional conven-
tion. Vote YES. 

Amphitheater/Events Center Fee 
We strongly believe that UCSD 

should have an amphitheater. But 
this poorly written referendum isn't 
the answer. It contains no guarantee 
that an amphitheater will ever be 
built, and there is a very real chance 
that students will pay $20 per quarter 
forever and never see a large pro-
gramming venue materialize. More-
over, this sends a dangerous mes age 
to the University. By voting for the 
referendum, students will be telling 
the administration that they are wil-
ling to solely fund facilities and pro-
grams that the University should have 
the responsibility to pay for. 

The UniverSity had planned to 
construct an amphitheater, but sev-
eral years ago it was quietly dropped 
from the campus' Master Plan. Sev-
eral years ago, the private company 
that built the Universal Amphitheater 
in Los Angeles offered to construct a 
smaller facility at UCSD free of 
charge. The administration rejected 
the offer because they did not want to 
allow the company to manage the 
facility. This is a bogus argument. 
The Regents approved last month a 
40-year lease agreement with a pri-
vate medical firm to build and man-
age an 80-bed neuropsychiatric hos-
pital on campus. This i. evidence of 
yet another case of administration 
double talk and inflexibility. Unfor-
tunately, this referendum will do 

problem. 

It is unfortunate that Gold pursued 
the campaign strategy she did. Con-
sidered independently, her extensive 
public relations experience would 
qualify her for the job. However, 
since the position she seeks includes 
voting power on the A.S. Council, 
judgement abilities should be a 
determining factor in voters' candi-
date selections. Therefore , the 
Guardian endorses Benny Singer for 
this post.

tion's ways. Organize a sit-in at the 
chancellor'S office or a letter-writing 
campaign to the Regents and your 
state assembly representatives, but 
vote NO on this referendum. 
Constitutional Convention 

As we said before, the constitution 
needs work. But this is a dangerous 
approach to repairing it. It isn't likely 
to produce a much better constitu-
tion, and has a large downside risk of 
producing a very bad one. The 
amendment allowing a greater num-
ber of referenda makes the conven-
tion unnecessary. Vote NO. 
Nighttime Parking 

This referendum is probably doom-
ed; it is difficult to find anyone who 
likes the idea of requiring permits for 
nighttime parking. The additional 
costs of enforcement, as well as the 
impact on campus events and safety 
of students who would have to park 
off-campus and walk through the 
dark far outweigh the small increase 
in revenues. It's just a bad idea, and 
we endorse a vote of NO. 
Committee for Lawyer 

Hiring a lawyer may not be great 
idea. But forming a committee to 
study options is. Students feel intimi-
dated by the power of the University 

in legal conflicts, and making it easier 
to obtain lawyer is important. It may 
be possible for the A.S. to make a 
deal with a lawyer or firm to be avail-
able for such conflicts, and the options 
should be explored thoroughly. Vote 
YES. 

Student Cooperative Center 
This is a tremendously ambitious 

referendum, and the University has 
already indicated that it will ignore 
the outcome of this vote. Not every-
thing in the referendum is a good idea 
- some of the specifics are poorly 
structured - but the spirit of the ref-
erendum is what's important. The co-
ops are an important part of this 
University, and the administration 
has been at war with them for years. 
This referendum sends a strong signal 
that students support the coopera-
tives' attempt to ensure self-deter-
mination, and that we don't wish to 
see them debilitated by Price Center 
commercialism. The actual outcome 
of this conflict will probably be some-
thing less that what this referendum 
demands, but if it loses, we run the 
risk of allowing the co-ops to disap-
pear as a progressive student force on 
this campus. That would be tragic for 
both the patrons and the members of 
the student cooperatives. Vote YES.

MISHKA MIGACZ 
Vice President External 

Guardian: What activities have 
you been involved with in the past 
and how have the e qualified you 
for the position of vice president 
external? Specifically, what cam-
pus activities? 
Migacz: First of all , I am a transfer 
student from Mira costa College. 
In my freshman year, I founded a 
law society. That wa actually my 
invitation into A.S. I learned 
about A.S. by being a founder of 
this law society. In my sopho-
more year at Mira Co ta College, 
I ran for the position of VP of 
policy and procedures. I won that 
election. I learned quite a bit from 
that . That experience has ... taught 
me how to lobby. Actually, I 
passed two bills through [Mira 
Costa's] congress ... and I've been 
very much in the political arena. 

Presently, I'm a chief justice on 
the Muir Judicial Review Board. 
I enjoy this position simply 
because I believe in order. I believe 
that all students must work 
together and work in harmo-
ny . .. and I feel that my position 
allows me to work with students 
and to achieve that goal. 
G: What would you identify as 
two major problems which have 
faced UCSD this year and what 
problems do you foresee arising 
next year? 
M: I think the big problem that a 
lot of students are aware of is the 
parking issue. Also, fees are going 
up and a lot of students can't 
afford that. Some people believe 
that it has to be done. I think 
there are other ways. 
G: And what will you do to help 
remedy those problems? 
M: There are plenty of budgets on 
this campus. There is plenty of 
money and I thjnk .everybody 
needs to start contributing more, 
financially, out of other budgets. I 
don't think it should be left on the 
burden of the students. 

I think we need to start with the 
Regents . They hold the money 
They pull the strings. I think that 
we need to start making them 
aware of what they're doing. I 
think we need to let them know 
that it's hurting us. I think we 
need to get people like Ron Pack-
ard and Senator [Bill] Craven 
involved. I think that if they see 
that we're reaching out to other 
people, they're going to have to be 
forced to change. 
G: And how would you deal with 
the parking issue? 
M: I think we need to start getting 
some petitions around . You get 
those petitions together and you 
send them to your local congress-
men. If the administration isn't . 
willing to help us, then we have to 
go beyond the administration. The 
way to go beyond is to go to 
government. 
G: In January, the UC Regents 
voted to increase student fees by 
10 to 17 percent for the 1989-90 
school year. As VP external, will 
you support or oppose future 
efforts to increase student fees 
and what avenues will you pursue 
to meet your goals? 
M: I believe the students need to 
take a hand on the student fees. 
There is an organization [the 
University of California Students 
Association] that all the UCs 
belong to and people are advocat-
ing that we be able to have control 
over these fees , if I'm correct. And 
I believe that's the way to go. 
G: What do you feel should be the 
role of a V P external in interact-

ing with private commercial 
enterprise effecting UCS D stu-
dents and how will you pursue 
that role with regard to Ogden 
Environmental Services and their 
efforts to burn toxic waste in close 
proximity to the campus? 
M: No, I don't want Ogden to 
burn and that's an issue on my 
flyer. I believe that we need to 
continue [to oppose Ogden] at the 
local levels. I advocate that we 
start with small [California state 
legislative] bills 0 that we stop 
running into these problems.

CRAIG PETERS 
Vice President External 

GUIUdilln: What activities have 
you been involved with in the past 
and how have these qualified you 
for the position of VP external? 
Specifically, what campus activi-
ties? 
Peten: A program which I helped 
design and then coordinate and 
then lead was called Help Forthe 
Homeless which was a drive for 
the Salvation Army to raise money 
for their homeless shelter. Last 
Wednesday, we had Party Smart 
Day which dealt with not only the 
campus, but was pan of a larger 
effort for the City of San Diego 
[sponsored] alcohol awareness 
week . That was my project and, 
all in all, it was very successful. 
G: What would you identify as 
two major problems which faced 
UCSD this year and what do you 
see as problems that will be con-

o tinuing into next year? 
P: r think probably the biggest 
problem that we have right now is 
that the administration is not 
responsive to the students' needs 
and has continually built this 
campus around their own inter-
ests and not the students' inter-
ests. The administration needs ... 
to think more carefully about 
student buildings and the main-
tenance of those buildings on this 
campus and who should be fund-
ing these. 

The administration has the 
resources ... to bring in these out-
side promoters, big companies 
that would be more than happy to 
give us money for these things for 
putting up their sign somewhere. 
The administration is so afraid of 
that outside influence .. . that they 

' won't do that. 
One of the things I'd like to do 

once in office is I'd like to make it 
mandatory that the administra-
tion pay SO percent of any build-
ing that is student-oriented on 
this campus. 

That leads to a second prob-
lem .. . which would be the incred-
ible underrepresentation we have 
here of less privileged 5t udents on 
this campus and the ridiculous 
attrition rates that we have of 
those students. The thing that we 
need to do is we need to support 
and we need to expand the [Stu-
dent Affirmative Action Com-
mittee] outreach program, in my 
opinion. 
G: How are you actually going to 
get the University to foot a larger 
portion of the bill for campus 
buildings? 
H: If we make it an A.S. constitu-
tionallaw that we cannot pay for 
more than SO percent of the build-
ing ... it can't even be brought up 
on the ballot unless the adminis-
tration is willing to pay 50 percent. 
G: In January, the UC Regents 
voted to increase student fees by 
10 to 17 percent for the 1989-90 
school year. As VP external, will 
you support or oppo e future 
efforts to increase student fees 
a.nd what avenue will you pur ue 
to meet your goals.? 
H: For UC San Diego in par-
ticular, I have to say I whole-
heartedly suppon the decrease of 

UCSD Guardian 
regi tration fees overall. If we 
could so mehow increase the 
system-based fees and significantly 
decrease the campu -ba ed fee 
by getting the administration to 
pay their share, yes, I would be in 
support of that. 
G: What do you feel should be the 
role of a VP external in interact-
ing with private commercial 
enterprises effecting UCSD stu-
dents and how will you pursue 
that role with regard to Ogden 
Environmental Services and their 
efforts to burn toxic waste close 
to campus? 
P: Obviously, that's the VP 
external's job so, yes, he must or 
she must deal with community 
influences on the campus. 

I n respect to specific corpora-
tions or companies and Ogden in 
particular, one of the things I 
think we should be doing is we 
should be maintaining checks on 
all companies in the surrounding 
San Diego area. I would be in 
favor and support some sort of 
bill where we must go in and 
make checks on these companies 
that are doing this and make sure 
that it's being done safely . . . and 
maybe do that in cooperation 
with the San Diego regulators 
and the federal government 
regulators.

STEPHANIE DE LA TORRE 
Vice President External 

Gwrdian: What activities have 
you been involved with in the past 
and how have these qualified you 
for the position of vice president 
external? 
De L. Torre: This past year, I've 
been A.S. Third College junior 
senator. The past two years, I've 
worked out of External Affairs 
through the University of Cali-
fornia Student Association. Also, 
I've worked with the student 
advocate. This past year, I was 
also co-chair of the Chicano/ la-
tino student organization on 
campus, and I've also been a 
member of the student affirma-
tive action committee. Right now, 
I'm the A.S. alternate to the 
Chancellor's Committee on Af-
firmative Action. 
G: What would you identify as 
two major problems that have 
faced UCSD this year and what 
do you perceive as problems that 
will persist into next year? 
T: The first one, I would say, is 
the Ogden waste site. Another 
one, ] guess, would be student 
safety. . 
G: And what would you do to 
help remedy those problems? 
T: In terms of the Ogden waste 
site, I feel I could inform students 
on what's going on. Information 

booth~ seem to work very good 
where you have literature out, 
perhaps by the gym steps or the 
Revelle Plaza. I'm not really too 
abreast on the issue, but I think 
you need to directly address the 
Ogden persol,lnel. 
G: The other problem you identi-
fied was the safety issue. What 
kinds of proposals would you 
have to remedy those problems? 
T: The shuttle route in the even-
ing has to be more extensive. A 
lot of students park down behind 
the medical school and it's really 
important that there's lighting. I 
propose perhaps having more 
shuttles. 
G: In January, the UC Regents 
voted to increase student fees by 
10 to 17 percent for the 1989-90 
school year. As VP external, will 
you support or oppose future 
efforts to increase student fees 
and what avenues will you pursue 
to meet your goals.? 
T: Last year, I went to Sacra-
mento and I lobbied through the 

See DE LA TORRE, pale 7 

L'C D Guo rdiaJl 

DeLaTorre 
Continued from page 6 
municipal lobby with External 
Affairs in direct opposition to the 
student fee increase. I would 
directly oppose this increase due 
to the fact that we're facing a lot 
of fees besides this 10 to 17 per-
cent increase and that's campus-
I>ased fees . 
G: What do you feel should be the 
role of a VP external in interact-
ing with private commercial 
enterprises effecting UCSD stu-
dents and how will you pursue 
that role with regard to Ogden 
Environmental Services and their 
efforts to burn toxic waste in close 
proximity to the campus? 

T: I feel that my role as VP exter-
nal is to try to insure and promote 
student representation on . .. com-
mittees. I don't know exactly the 
logistics of it, but if the adminis-
tration does have a committee 
with Ogden waste site, perhaps 
address the fact that student 
representation is needed. 

V AN NESS HARRIS 
Vice President Finance 

Guardian: What activities have 
you been involved with in the past 
and how have these qualified you 
for the position of VP of finance? 
Harris: Well, I really haven't had 
any direct experience with finance, 
but I've been the director of a 
couple of boards . I'm director of 

NEWS 
SPECIAL ELECTION COVERAGE 

Royal Brothers of Excellence and 
I've worked very closely with my 
budget coordinator and helped 
him plan and get activities together 
and get the budget together. I've 
also been historian for Afro-
American Student Union, and 
I've worked closely with the 
budget director. Also, 1'm the 
[Student Affirmative Action Com-
mittee] representative of Third 
[College] which -allocates a cer-
tain amount of money to student 
organizations under the affirma-
tive action umbrella. I've also 
worked with Third Council. 
G: What would you identify as 
two major problems which faced 
UCSD this year and what do you 
see as problems that will need to 
be faced next year? 
H: Basically . . . J would say safety. 
Also, another major problems, I 
would say, is the Ogden waste site 
by Scripps. I [see] a conflict of 
interests there because the Uni-
versity supports the Ogden com-
pany, but they're burning waste 
that's going to be hazardous to 
the students' health. 
G: And how will your being in the 
office of VP finance help ac-
complish or solve those problems? 
H: If I can get more money from 
the A.S. and the board members, 
maybe I can use it to work around 
and promote areas that I see as 
two major issues. They could buy 
another shuttle bus and, for the 
Ogden waste site, maybe I could 
help start a campaign where we 
can get officers together to make 
some kind of motion, some kind 
of rally so that the University 
knows we really mean business 
about the concerns to our health. 
G: As VP finance , what kinds of 
budgetary actions would you 
support to get UCSD through 

next year? 
H: I wouldn't support the increase 
of 10 to 17 percent [in student 
fees] at all. I'm directly opposed 
to that because the students' 
financial aid stays the same. That 
forces them to take out more 
loans, it forces them to work 
more hours and why should we 
make students pay for the state's 
deficit? I know the increase in 
student fees are going for parking 
which I was directly opposed to. 
G: If you're opposed to this in-
crease in student fees and the 
parking fees, what alternatives 
would there be to raising student 
fees to help support the school? 
H: I don't know. That's a good 
question. How will we increase 
the budget besides this? Really, 
right now, I don't have ideas 
exactly how we will do that. 

But I think the government 
should fund more money to us. It 
should be a government funded 
thing even though the state is in a 
sort of deficit because ... you put 
money into the school and then 
you promote more learning which 
the students give back into the 
work force . 
G: The 17 percent 1989-90 fee 
increase for out-of state students 
means out-of-state fees have risen 
by 32 percent within two years. Is 
this an acceptable rate of increase 
for such fees and what actions will 
you take in that area? 
H: I'm opposed to it being raised 
that much, but tho e fees are 
directly necessary because.. . I 
think priority should go to stu-
dents of the state. If students want 
to come from out of state... I 
think they have to look at that 
idea that they .. . don't have first 
priority so they should be willing 
to pay that extra money in order 

to go to this school of quality 
learning.

majoring in biology. 
ANDERS ROEDE 
Vice President Finance 

Guardian: What campus activi-
ties have you been involved with 
in the past and how ' have these 
qualified you for the position of 
VP financial? 
Roede:l'm a senior majoring in 
economics. This past year, I served 
as Warren College treasurer and 
duties of that position [included] 
overseeing the budget of the 
Warren Student Council. I feel 
that I've gained the skills needed 
to execute the responsibilities of 
VP finance. 
G: What would you identify as 
two major problems which have 
faced UCSD this year and what 
problems do you anticipate for 
next year? 
R: I feel that a smoother-running 
A.S. is going to be able to ac-
complish much more for the stu-
dents than this year because of a 
lot of internal problems with the 
A.S. itself. I think if an A.S. 
comes into its term with goals in 
mind and hits the ground run-
ning, as we've been saying, it's 
going to be able to accomplish a 
lot more. 

I feel that beneficiaries of 
affirmative action are lacking 
support at UCSD. I feel that this 
is a problem not only at the high 
school level, but also a problem 
with the administration and a 
problem with the A.S . itself. Ways 
to remedy that situation would 
be, maybe, give students who 
come to UCSD under the affir-
mative action program suppon 
once they're here, not abandon

them once they're here. 
G: What will you do to help 
remedy those problems? 
R: Communication. outreach pro-
grams ,j ust making those students 
aware of what's available to them. 
That , I think , is going to be more 
of an administrative issue than, 
perhaps, one that 111 deal directly 
with. . . be I think awareness IS gOlOg to 
a major factor, though, more than 
specific funding. But, again, stu-
dents that have a need and a want 
forfunding. I'mgoingto,asmuch 
as possible, have an open door 
policy to try to accommoeate as 
many students as possible. 
G: What would be some of your 
primary budget allocations? 
R: As far as funding goes for stu-
dent organizations, those that 
have a need for programming and 
that have good structural organi-
zations in their proposals for pro-
gramming events in the past will 
be continued to be allowed to do 
so. 

Funding for smaller groups, 
for example, can be made more 
available through, maybe, coop-
eration in cosponsored events if 
you have groups with similar 
interests. 
G: The 17 percent 1989-90 stu-
dent fee increase for out-of-state 
students means out-of-state fees 
have risen by 32 percent within 
two years. Is this an acceptable 
increase rate for such fees and 
what actions will you take in that 
area? 
R: I think that student fees as a 
whole are high. I think that alter-
native modes of raising funds 
rather than just charging students 
should be looked into . Forexam-
pie, the students want and , I 
think, need an amphitheater on

three years. Also, 1 was sopho-
more enlltor. I also served as 
Revelle Dean's intern. This year, 
I'm presently A.S. commissioner 
of operations, services and enter-
prises, One of the activities I've 
done is orientation leader.

. , . but that's a direct matter that 
the VP of external affairs would 
deal with. As a member of the

or not support an ideal and show 
our support through a resolution 
or direct support at the attending 
meeting.

DARIN MALLOY 
Academic Affairs 

GUII,dian: What activities have 
you been involved with in the past 
and how have these qualified you 
for this position (campus activ-
ities)? 
Malloy: I have served the last two 
years on two different academic 
senate committees, which will ... 
help me in dealing on CEP 
to get things done for the students 

I've also served on an A.S. 
advisory committee on T / A de-
velopment this year, and on sev-
eral campus-wide organizations 
and the presidential campaign. 

G: What would you identify as 
two major problems which faced 
UCSD this year, and what prob-
lem do you anticipate arising 
next year (specifically, regarding 
the A.S.)? 
M: One major problem, I think, is 
the infighting going on within the 
Council. 

The A.S. Council controls the 
resources for representing the stu-
dents, and when they're doing all 
this infighting, they're obviously 
not accomplishing all that they 
could . 

The second major problem that 
the A.S. faces, and will continue 
to face next year, is the power that 
they have. Unlike other UC cam-
puses like UCLA and UC Berke-
ley, they are not independent of 
the administration. This seriously 
affects their power in terms of try-
ing to get things done. 
G: How do you plan to improve 
or solve these problems? 
M: First , I think we can work 
with the faculty, with the adminis-
tation - we need to make our 
views clear to them, 

Quite honestly, we outnumber 
them. This is not only the admin-
istration or the faculty, this is also

R: The need for ethnic diversity .-----____________________ ---' 
and, I think, that's going to con-
tinue throughout next year. Not 
only a need for an ethnic studies 
program at UCSD _ .. but the 
need for faculty and staff of other 
ethnicities. 

Another problem, too, is the 
animosity toward growth. One of 
the things I want to see is the A.S. 
grow and expand with the ca m-
pus. Our campus is growing so 
much. that our [A.S .) Constitu-
tion is not fit for it anymore .. . [A 
consitutional convention) is going 
to be needed in the future - soon. 
G: What will you do to help solve 
these problems? 
R: The only thing, as a student, 
that I can do with ethnic diversity 
as being directly involved ... is 
showing our support as an A.S. 
council to them ... for the idea 
they're standing behind . Person-
ally, I could contact people, show 
my individual support with de-
partments and maybe attending 
departmental meetings or chan-
cellor's meetings. 

With the animosity toward the 
growth ofthe campus, I think it's 
going to fix itself with the Price 
Center . . . but you really need to 
grow. We, as an A.S. have to 
grow as well, expanding services 
and expanding the offices thai we 
have. 
G: What would be major A.S. 
budget expenditures that you 
would support for next year? 
R: I think that programming is a 
big pari of ASUCSD not only to 
direct student programming, but 
al 0 (0 support student organiza-
tions. I think the student organi-
zations' programming that they 
do individually with the A.S. 
support, is even more important 
than A.S. direct type of events 
because when the actual student 
organization puts on an event, 
that 's the actual students them-
selves doing something that they 
want to see. 

Something I would vocally 
support and try to push for and 
try to encourage people to vote 
for would be something I started 
this year as services and enter-
prises commissioner: airport 
shuttle service. 
G: The 17 percent 1989-90 stu-
dent fee increase for out-of-state 
students means out-of-state fees 
have risen by 32 percent within 
two years . 1s this an acceptable 
increase rate for such fees and 
what actions will you take in that 
area? 
R: I think no major increase is 
acceptable for students becau e, 
of cou rse, we're on limited budgets

the community; the red-curbing 
for example; we are 16,000 votes. 
If the A.S . Council had organized 
50 people to go down to a an 
Diego City Council meeting to 
say, "we don't want Torrey Pines 
red-curbed,"it wouldn't have been 
red-curbed. 

We need to go out and organize 
the students ... so that they can 
demand majority representation 
on the parking advisory commit-
tee or so that they can demand 
elimination of the "W" grade. 
G: What should the A.S. Coun-
cil' attitude be toward the admin-

i~tration (academically, in part-
icular)? 
M: We need to pressure the 
administration to do everal very 
important things. We should be 
\"er~ unsatisfied with them right 
now; for example, there must be a 
mandatory ethnic studies gradua-
tion requirement. This is some-
thing I'm going to work for, and I 
think the Council should work 
for. 

We need to pressure them on 
extending when you can change 
your grading option. 
G: Do you feel that tudents are 
adequately repre ented in aca-
demic policymaking, and what, if 
anything, would you do to change 
thi '! 
M: We have to have voting rights 
on the Academic enate. That is 
mandatory. The iss ue is not stu-
dent right ... unless we empower 
ourselves. , and get the voting 
rights, we can be kicked off at any 
time by the administation. 

It's not an issue of rights, it's an 
issue of empowerment: and until

ALINE C. ZIRINO 
Academic Affairs 

Guardian: What activitie have 
you been involved with in the pa t 
and how have these qualified you 
forthe position (specifically, cam-
pus activities)? 
Zirino: My fre hman year, I was 
at Cal-Berkeley; and I started out 
as ASUC Senator in 1986. I 
founded a political party up there, 
which still exists. I worked in the 
Uni tage house ... sort of an inter-
national house: I worked for the 
di abled student program at Berk-
eley. 

I worked for the YMCA juve-
nile delinquent program there: I 
wa a youth mentor for kids who 
had had trouble. I worked in the 
ASUC as assistant in the ASUC 
store. 

When I came to UCSD, I got 
appointed as repre entative to the 
Academic Senate - I have that 
po ition again . I was on The 
Committee on the Statu of 
Women at UCS D . I work for 
Provost Bond, in admissions; I 
orga nized the stude nt dance com-
pany, for the ballet - I wa in the 
California Ballet. And, I'm the 
ASUC artist for the Charity Ball 
for the grand opening of the Price 
Center. 

I worked at Mesa College, at 
the TA P Center, in chemistry, 
orga nic chemistry, calculus and 
biology . .. . [do ome politics, 
but I'm more a behind-the-scenes 
son of worker: I'm not used to 
being out in front of the situation; 
hut I have organized about 10 dif-

SAN DIEGO 

ferent groups . 
G: What would you identify as 
two major problems which faced 
UC 0 this year, and what prob-
lems do yo u a nticipatc arising 
next year (specifica lly, regarding 
the A . . )'? 
Z: My idea of a council i a group 
of people who work actively and 
con tantly on serious issues, like 
lowering the fees , creating student 
scholarship source, fig hting the 
parking [problem 1 .... 

I see the fees as the most impor-
tant problem. I come from a ve ry 
poor high school, and I see a lot of 
people that are not goingto UCSD 
(and other univer itie ) ... be-
cause they can't afford it. We 
have got to make UCS 0 afforda-
ble ... the little ex pen es [are 
important] too, [like] the parking 
[permits]. 

I don't ha ve a permit; I've been 
going here without a permit, and 
that' hard todo - I mean, I walk 
quite a bit. I've had to work up to 
three jobs just to put myself 
through school , and I'm pretty 
bitter about that .... we hould be 
able to have people attend this 
Universi ty no matter what their 
economic level is. 
G: How to plan to improve or 
solve tho e problems? 
Z: " I think we need to work really 
closely with the .. . external affair 
lobby. I think we have to have 
much more of a public how; if 
necessary, we need to stage peace-
ful , tactful protests, to our chan-
cellor . 

I think people will Ii ten .. . we

i tration (academically, in part-
icular)? 
Z: Being the rep for a couple of 
years, I've been dealing with just 
that ; and what I try to do i be 
worthy of respect. I think the 
approach that has worked so far 
in dealing with the Academic

low-key, respectful ; to speak with 
them individually when you have 
question .

MICHAEL HOLMES 
Communications 

Guardian: Why do you think 
you're running unopposed? 

Holmes: It makes sense thaI you 
should know a little bit about 
how the Media Board work and 
the way the commissioner runs 
different media. 

So, becau e of that, it' usually 
someone on the Board , or some-
one affiliated with the Media 
Board already [that runs for com-
missioner of communications). 
I'm the presidential representa-
tive for the Media Board right 
now. 

So, that cut down the possibil -
ities [of candidates] right there 
and so that's probably one of the 
reasons why there's not too many 
people going out for thi position. 

The other thing is that it's not 
considered a very important posi-
tion, and that's what I'm kind of 
afraid of. I think it should be a lot 
more important. 
G: What activities, specifically on 
campus, have you been involved 
with that qualify you for this 
posi tion? 
H: As far as leadershi p position , 
I'm on the Residence Hall Coun-
cil, which is a representation for 
the people who live on campus for 
Third College, and from that, I'm 
a representative to the Third 
Council. 

I also am the chairman for the 
African section of the Sun God 
festival. And the Media Board 
itself is a qualification because 
you learn how to work within the 
system that way. 
G: What would you identify as 
two major problems, either at 
UCSD, within the A .S ., or specif-
ically within the Media Board, 
that happened this year and that 
might come about next year?

face next year is the problem with 
the New Indicator. They have a 
lawsuit pending against the A.S. 

It's probably going to come 
about next year or the year after 
where some newspapers were 
thrown away, so they're feeling 
that their rights have been 
invaded. 

So, the commissioner next year, 
or the year after is going to have 

NEW 
SPECIAL ELECTION COVERAGE 

to deal with that mess, and it 
really is a disaster. 

Another problem is that the 
Media Board is considered just an 
advisory committee. It's not really 
very strong. I've heard a lot of 
comments like, " Well, we can 
change them. They're not per-
manent. We can change them to 
fit our needs." And that's not the 
way it should be. 

As it is now, we're just advi-
sory. We're not very strong at all 
... This year we tried to make [our

G: How are you going to budget 
the funds to make all the alterna-

possible? 
H: Well, it's never possible to 
make everyone happy. I feel the 
last commissioner did quite well 
in the way that she just tried to see 
what their needs were and do it 
that way; looking, of course, at 
their requests, but also going 
through background work , look-
ing at what exactly the costs were

and trying to go about it that way. 
That seems to be pretty logical 

to me. [The Media Board] is 
going to be putting out a survey

them say which newspapers they 
prefer. We want to know wat's

H: No. That's impossible. The 
board cannot censor [because of

If [the papers are in] the stu-
dents interests and for UCSD, 
that's fine. We can't judge con-

Israeli Politician Seeks Cultural Integration 
By MAUREEN SPURR 
Siaff Writer 

An old conflict, a long-time 
grudge, years of resentment. 
We\'e all had them. But few have 
had them as long a the Arabs and 
I raelis. 

This is a conflict stemming from 
a far back as Biblical years, and 
the lruggle for territory and 
peaceful coexistence has been 
everything but harmonic. Now 
2,000 years worth of wrongs have 
accumulated and coexistence 
seems like a far-fetched dream. 

One campu organization, The 
Israeli Action Committee, would 
like to see better ed ucation about 
the developments in the Middle 
East, said Darrin Freedburg, Co-
Chairperson of the Committee. 

Freedburg agrees with recent 
criticism that the media's cover-
age of events i slanted or only 
partly uncovers the ituation by 
showing violent news flashes. 

They would like to explore dif-
ferenl per pective , especially 
those of Pale tinians. Along these 
lines, the Committee in ited the 
Consul General Muhamed Mas-
sarwa, an Arab who grew up in 
Israel, to speak on Thursday. 

Massarwa came to UCSD from 
the Israli Consulate in Atlanta, 
Georgia, where he serves as Con-
sul General of Israel for the Sou-
theastern Region of the United 

States. He said , regarding his 
appointment, " I'm both an Arab 
and an I raeli. I have more or less 
fulfi lled my aspirations in the 
Arab phere. We, of the younger 
generation of Israeli Arabs, have 
been demanding, for some time 
now, that we be given opportuni-
ties for full integration into all 
aspects of Israel. I ee myappoint-
ment in the Foreign Service as 

"Israeli Arabs have 
been demanding, for 
some time now, oppor-
tunities for full inte-
gration. " 

-M. Massarwa 

just such an opportunity." 
"Today, more than in the past, 

there is a vast majority of the 
population in Israel from differ-
ent parties, that raised the necces-
sity to solve the Palestinian issue 
or the Palestinian conflict," Was-
sarwa said . 

"I do believe thai lI .. ithin Israel, 
to get the message about the peo-
ple living [in the territories) now 
is the main issue for . . . the politi-
cal agenda within Israel, about 
the issue within the Israelj society. 

Every week we havea new survey, 
every weeek we have new views-
new people ... meeting with 
Palestinians in the territories," he 
said. 

" In the late seventies, after the 
... war in 1973 it was president 
Sadat [who] realized that there is 
no way to achieve a victorious 
war or a military solution. Even if 
o ne part . . . can, the international 
community will not allow them to 
achieve a military solution or a 
victorious war," he added. 

Several members of the audi-
ence objected to Massarwa 's state-
ments and repeatedly interrupted 
his lecture. They said that they 
were Arabs themselves and had 
been thrown out of Israel. Mas-
sarwa announced that he could 
not go on if members of the 
audience continued to interrupt 
him. 

Massarwa said his goal was to 
present an objective update of the 
situation in the Middle East. 
Among the isssues he mentioned 
were the proposed autonomy of 
the occupied territories, negotia-
tion of their boundaries and the 
hope that the superpowers will 
help out in an international peace 
conference. 

Massarwa's olution to the 
problems was to "deal with the 
conflict without emotion." He said 
that the two groups must stop 
worrying about who is recogniz-

Society for Creative A nachronis1Il 
Brings Historical Tradition to Life 

By JULIE MONRO 
Features Editor 

A wrinkle in time crossed Revelle College Saturday. Knights fastened down their 
armor, as lords and ladies danced 
and told stories. 

It was a tournament for the 
Society for Creative Anachronism 
(SCA). The society holds such 
events throughout the world. San 

Members create their own "persona" with historical information. 

Diego hosts tournaments as often 
as twice each month. 

The event at Stonehenge began 
with Opening Court at the bar-
on's tent at which a "dead" Saint 
Artimus was presented to the 
baron. Three contests ensued. The 
first was to find the saint's mur-
derer. The seco nd was to find the 
place of the crime, and the third 
was to find the murder weapon (a 
quill stained with Saint Artimus's 
blood). 

Contests were also held for the 
best confession to the murder and 
the best storyteller to describe the 
details of the crime. 

At night, the group gathered 
for a "revel," at which they lis-
tened to the winning storyteller, 
danced, and ate dessert. 

SCA also holds "wars," which 
last entire weekends . The organi-
zation is divided into kingdoms, 
principalities, and baronies. Dean 
Halford is the baron (Baron 
Talanque) of UCSD's region . 

A recent war between the king-
doms of San Diego and Arizona 
involved 780 fighters and twice as 
many other SCA participants, 
according to Third junior Ste-
phanie Prewitt. 

Prewitt is the seneschal (presi-
dent) of UCSD's year-old branch 
of the SCA, the College of Saint 
Artimas. The group includes 
UCSD staff and students as well 
as people from the surrounding 
community. 

SCA members encompass a 
wide span of age groups. "There's 
all kinds of people, and ... fam-
ilies will bring their kids out," 
Prewitt said. 

There also seems to be little

Many fighters make their own weapons, shields and armor. 

discrimination as far as role play-
ing. "There's a 55-year-old woman 
who's the head of a war ·band," 
said Muir sophomore Alicia Anne 
Conley, the group'S "keys officer." 

Titles are awarded for various 
achievements. "A knight is a high 
award in arms, and you also have 
to be good at medieval chess, 
music, poetry, dancing ... and 
they have to be chivalrous," Con-
ley said. 

Members conjure up their own 
character or "persona" from his-
torical information. They model 
their personality, name, clothing, 
occupation, and background ac-
cording to real historical culture 
between 900 and 1600 A.D. 

Members can be as creative as 
they wish as long as they can 
explain "how they got there," 
Prewitt said. For example, "We 
have a Russian fighter fighting 
with a Celtic warband," she said. 
One restriction, however, is that 
SCA characters may not be real 
historical filures. 

"I'm Welsh, so that dictates 
how my name is spelled," Prewitt 
said, whose SCA name is Sian Ap 
Alywinn. "You go to war and you 
get used to three days of everyone 
ca\ling you by your SCA name, 
imd you don't answer to your real 
name," she said. 

Conley's SCA character is Aith-
bric na Dhu-Ard, a Scottish High-
lander. "For me, the year is 1315. 
I picked that because my father, 
in real life, died last year, and I 
figured he could have died in the 
bailIe of Banicburn . . . which was 
in 1314," she explained. 

Once a member has chosen a 
persona, they are not bound to its 
characteristics for life. "Maybe [a 
member's) persona is Scottish, 
but for that day they want to wear 
a German outfit, you just say ... 
you went traveling," Conley said . 
"Or your father is a merchant, 
that's a good one," Prewill added. 

"The lady I'm taking belly danc-
ing lessons from, she is a Scottish

Speaker 
Continued from pale 12 
ing who, such as the Israelis, who 
don't want to recognize the PLO's 
right to exist, and the Palestini-
ans, who don't want to recognize 
that the state of Israel exists. 

The two groups must start talk-
ing, Massarwa said, instead of 
ignoring the other's existence. He 
explained that there are two ways 
of solving problems: with the mil-
itary or with negotiation. 

When Massarwa mentioned 
Israel as a "Jewish state, "mem bers 
of the audience became especia\ly 
aggravated, arguing that Israel is 
not a "Jewish state" by virtue of 
the fact that there are Arabs living 
there. Another argument against 
Massarwa's lecture was that he 
wasn't telling the objective truth 
because he worked for the Israeli 
Government. 

The argument pursued to the 
extent that both parties began 
speaking Arabic. Co-Chairperson 
Freedburg made an effort to 
interject and mediate, while mem-
bers of the audience began to 
argue among themselves . 

Freedburg and Lisa Pinck, the 
other chairperson of the Israel 
Action Committee, encourage 
students to join their organization 
or offer opposing viewpoints. 

The organization was created 
about seven years ago. It spon-
sors speakers, movies and other 
social events.

pusband kidnapped her ... the 
purpose is to have fun," Conley 
said . 

SCA has a formal structure at 
the administrative level with ac-
countants, a lawyer, rules, and a 
board of directors (known as the 
"8odj. The society will celebrate 
its 24th anniversary on May I. 

Although SCA is an atonom-
ous international organization, mem-
bers of SCA may have been seen 
battling or dancing at Revelle's 
Renaissance Faire. They contri-
bute to the event as a separate 
organization. SCA will be back 
on campus April 30 for UCSD's 
Open House.

COMMISSIONER 

public relations 

BENNY SINGER 
Public Relations 

Guardian: What activities, specifi-
cally on campus, have you been 
involved with in the past and how 
have these qualified you for this 
position? 
Singer: I helped develop the 
Minority Affair Program for 
AS 10 [Associated Student Intern-
ship Office]. 

I was able to develop a pro-
gram that was only for minorities, 
meaning that we went out and 
looked for specific companies that 
were lookmg for minority stu-
dents and we were able to form a 
file of maybe 25-30 organizations 
interested only in minorities .... 
We advertised this special pro-
gram and there was an increase in 
minority tudents coming into the 
office. 

Also, I have been VOlunteering 
for the public relations committee 
in the past. This year I have not 
been very active with this com-
mittee becau e they were not doing 
a lot and I felt very frustrated . 

I had an internship at the [San 
Diego] Mayor's office in the 
department of public relations in 
the Department of Environment. 
That was a very big influence on 
my college life because I was talk-
ing to people of the San Diego 
community; people with different 
issues than college issues so I was 
able to expand my views on other 
problems. 
G: What would you identify as 
two of the major problems which 
faced UCSD this year and are 
likely to arise next year? 
S: Thefact that [thi year's Public 
Relations Committee] is not com-
municating to the students 100 
percent. I feel that there are many 
activities that we are very vaguely 
told about in the sense that we 
have a bulletin page in the 
Guardian in which all the organi-
zations try to get an ad for an 
event and you end up with one 
line per event ... and it doesn't tell 
you anything. 

So, I would try to get funding 
for the organizations to have ad-
vertising money where they can 
put a quarter page ad in .... I 
don't think one page is enough for 
a school like this. We have so 
many organizations. 

There are a lot of students who 
come to class and go home ... and 
you can't expect somebody to 
participate in a school adtivity 
when they don't know what activ-
ities there are for them to partici-
pate in. 

And another thing that I also 
think has not been done is the 
input from students. We don't 
have a chance to tell the public 
relations commissioner what he's 
doing wrong. 

On my platform, I would like 
to have an input box . .. where 
you can express to me what is 

going wrong. They don't have this 
box . The only way you can com-
municate to the commissioner of 
public relations is if you know 
who he is, if you go to his office 
and you make an appointment 
and you see him. 

If you get input, you can pro-
vide a better service. 

I also want to have an informa-
tion telephone line where you 
would call in 534-INFO, and it 
would give you the information 
for that week's activities. 

Also, I was thinking about put-
ting a section in the newspaper 
where it would inform students of 
the A.S. Council meetings .. . 
what passes and what doesn't .. . 
and in that same ection, list what 
is ue will be addressed on the 
next Council meeting, 0 if you 
are interested in making sure some-
thing passes, you can go to the 
Council meeting and express your 
views. 
G: Is it the role of the PR commis-
sioner to go out of his or her way 
to improve relation hips between 
UCSD and La Jolla? 
S: Absolutely. Not only with La 
Jolla, but with downtown San 
Diego; with Del Mar. I don't 
think it's a primary goal of the 
public relations commis ioner to 
make sure that the people in La 
Jolla know what is going on here. 

That wouldn't be on the top of 
my list, but I definitely think that 
it is very important that we get the 
community involved. More impor-
tantly that the students are in-
volved, first. That's number one 
on my list, to let the students 
know what's going on. 
G: Should the public relations 
commissioner be associated with 
the University'S Public Information 
Office? 
S: Absolutely. Because it's another

way of approaching the students. 
Anything that will get me to a 
student, I will do it, without break-
ing the school laws, and if it's 
under my budget .... That's my 
main concern. The students are 
not informed.

ALLYSON GOLD 
Public Relations 

Guardian: What activities have 
you been involved with, specifi-
cally on-campu , that you feel 
qualify you for thi position? 
Gold: I've done a lot of things. 
For the past year, I've been the 
publicity commissioner at Warren 
College. So, I've done publicity 
for all the Warren College Stu-
dent Council events. 

Through that position, I helped 
out a lot on the Commuter Board; 
helped publicize their events. I've 
[also] helped out with the all-
campus Commuter Board and 
pubficizing their events. 

I'm currently serving on the 
Public Relations Council for the 
1989 Sun God Festival. 

I'm also on Media Board ... 0 
I'm familiar with all the on-
campus media aside from the 
Guardian, which I think is real 
helpful because they can be util-
ized more. 

I also worked last summer at a 
public relations and advertising 
agency as an intern. 
G: How do you intend to take 
what you've learned about the 
media and put it to U9C at UCS D? 
Gold: One of the most useful 
things I learned at the .. . agency 
[is that public relations] isn't j.ust 
sitting in the office and endmg 
out press releases. A large part of 
the public relations as well as the 
advertising aspect is getting to 

UCSD Guardian 
know the people. 

I intend to stay on the Media 
Board again next year, because I 
think it's important to maintain 
that contact with all the newspap-
ers, and that gives me good access. 

[Contacts] will help me be able 
to enhance the image of the A.S ., 
which i an important part. It'l 
help me to get more publicity for 
all the events ... and not just your 
standard ones. 

I'd like to increase sports pub-
licity, maybe doing intramural 
sports championship pUblicity ... 
and establishing those relation-
ships will maybe help that appear. 
G: You've already gone into it 
but the next question is, could 
you identify a couple of the major 
problems that you've seen either 
at UCSD, within the A.S ., or spe-
cifically with the public relations 
committee this year which could 
a rise nex t year? 
Gold: 1'1 start with the public 
relations commissioner and the 
problems I see. Public relations is 
getting publicity for whoever 
you're representing. 

When it's just called public 
relations, that's free publicity. 
That's establishing those relation-
ships and getting articles in and 
stories placed. It's free. 

Then there's advertising. Adver-
tising is something that you pay 
for. 

It's been discu sed that [the 
public relations commisioner] 
position should be broken down 
into advertising and public re-
lations. 

I don't have a problem with 
combining both, but I really think 
the problem is that all that I've 
seen happen this year and in the 
past is that the public relations 
person has only done advertising 

See GOLD, page 15 

UCSD Guardian 

Gold 
Continued from page 14 
... there's more to it than just tpe 
advertising. 

In terms of advertising ... the 
only events that really get a big 
push are events that most of the 
students attend: the TGs, the 
Reggae Fest, the Jazz Fest ... but , 
there's a lot more. 

All students pay fees . We 
shouldn't just try and advertise 
events that most of the students 
attend. We should try to reach 
out to all the students. 
G: Do you think that the public 
relations commissioner should 
help to improve the relationship 
between UCSD and the sur-
rounding communities? 
Gold: Absolutely ... Like I said, 
I'm fairly experienced with work-
ing with local media, and they're 
real supporters. 

Advertisements in local media 
- not that you can really adver-
tise, "Hey, we really are nice guys," 
but advertisements - people don't 
believe those. There's more truth 
in news; if it's in an article. 

I can work with them and get 
them to write stories about what's 
going on. When the Sun God Fes-
tival happens, that's going to be a 
real loud event, but it's a charity 
event. 

And they should know that, 
and it should be out in the local 
media so the community could 
say, "We're going to be up till 
midnight tonight, but they're giv-
ing this money to the Abused 
Children's Foundation." That' a 
real philanthropic thing.

leader, been on AIDS Awareness 
Committee; we've made an edu-
cational video at Warren College . 
Also, I have a job off-campus in 
sales and marketing, which deals 
specifically with public relations. 
G: What would you identify as 
two major problems, either at 
UCSD, with the A.S., or with 
specifically the commissioner of 
public relations that have hap-
pened this year and that you 
anticipate happening next year? 
C: Well , actually I don't antici-
pate them happening if I can head 
them off. One problem I see is not 
enough outreach through publi-
city or public relations. 

I feel that there can be more 
outreach to diverse groups be-
cause there are a lot ofleaders out 
there that aren't being targeted 
through the public relations, and 
I feel that that's a problem. 

I feel that that can be targeted 
a little better, there can be more 
public relations in that sense; 
going out to those groups and 
asking them for leaders to join the 
A.S. 
G: Do you feel that your job will 
have anything to do with the out-
side comm unities? 
C: Yes. I feel that that's another 
problem. I feel that a lot of the 

actions that have been taken 
against the UniversitY,like the red 
lining of Torrey Pines, people cal-
ling up and telling us to shut 
down Reggae Fest when it's too 
loud, that stems from our lack of 
reaching out to the community in 
the first place. 

I think that if we invite [the 
surrounding communities] in and 
reach out to them more, there will 
be less tension between the Uni-
versity and our community. 

G: How would you interact with 
on-campus media? 
C: Everyone reads the Guardian. 
That's an aspect I intend to use. 
Everyone reads it. You have to 
get in. You have to do an update, 
not only on upcoming events, but 
what is the A.S. doing for stu-
dents, what is important legisla-
tion. 

Maybe people want to be at 
these (A.S.) meetings to see what 
we're putting through. And that, 
obviously, can go into the 
Guardian. That's something we 
can use that has been budgeted. 

I do see an A .S. page, but what 
are they really telling us?

COMMISSIONER 
Students, it is time 10 pick Ihe BEST 
candidate for commissioner of Aca-
demic Affairs. I feel that I am that per-
son. I have volunteered on various 
Academic Senate and A.S. commit-
tees during my two years at UCSD. 1 
worked wilh Srudents for Jesse Jackson 
last year, and earlier this year was a 
paid staffer for Ihe DukaldsCampaign. 
I hope you will vote for me and the 
other members of the BESTs late, since 
we seek to transform the A.S. govern-
ment into a body which will truly rep-
resent us. For example. if elected I will 
try to eliminate the "W " grade, and 
extend the deadline by which srudents 
must change Iheir grading option. 

ALINE ZIRINO 
ACADEMIC AFFAIRS 

COMMISSIONER 
My goals as Commissioner of Aca-
demic Affairs: To work for Reduced 
Class Size in undergraduate work. 
Increase personal attention by faculty, 
staff, and T As. Academic Excellence 
means srudents learn, are motivated, 
challenged, interested and have mar-
ketable skills as a result of their classes. 
ltdoes not necessarily mean overflow-
ing lecture halls and harsh grading. 

I believe all representative should 
actively work on issues Ihat severely 
affect our lives as students: grade dis-
putes. financial aid, scholarships, 
safety, parking, fee increases, and social 
activities on the campus. I have eApe-
rience as a UCSD media lOr, represen-
tati ve and publicist, Ihrough persis-
tence we can accomplish all of our 
goals. 

GIOVANNI MUZZARELLI

COMMISSIONER 
Having taken over 75 clallCi from 15 

different departments in my almost 4 
years here al UCSD, including sum-
mer session, I have a very good idea 
how most departments work and have 
had the opportunity 10 get to know 
many of the Facuhy. Furthermore, 
having been an OASIS tutor has given 
me not only the perspective of seeing 
what srudents need in the form of Aca-
demic services but also Ihat of how 
such programs are run from the Ad-
ministrativeSide.I feel that the above 
qualities demonstrate that I am very 
well acquainted wilh Ihe various as-
pects of the academic process of the 
school, and along with my energy and 
enthusiasm I would be an excellent 
choice 10 perform the duties required 
of the Academic Affairs Commis-
sioner. 

MIKE HOLMES 
COMMUNICATIONS 

COMMISSIONER 
The Media Board is not just a superfi-
cial part of Ihe A.S. as many seem to 
see it-- the Board can be alot more. I 
see the Board as a strong check against 
media legislation and budget alloca-
tion -- not a weak advisory nor a direct 
part of Ihe A.S . With such problems as 
a pending lawsuit against the A.S. it is 
clear Ihat we need a commission Ihat is 
unafraid to work behind the scenes 10 
prevent and abolish Ihese problems. 
Ironically, it is communication that is 
needed -- more t.alJring and coopera-
tion and less power and struggle.

JAMES REINER 
REVELLE JUNIOR SENATOR 

Revelle is the oldest college on Ihe 
UCSD Campus and deserves fair and 
vocal representation at AS Council 
meetings. As a Senator, I will make an 
active commitment 10 strengthen this 
link between Revelle SrudenLS and the 
A.S . Council. In addition, I will work 
for the following: 
-obtaining a firm commitment from 
the administration for education 
concerns over Ih.e current overempha-
sis on research concerns. 
- work for moving Revelle classes 10 
Revelle classrooms (No Humanities 
classes at TLH) 
-Address Revelle Parking problems 
-Work for equal allocation of A.S. 
Money. This Tuesday. vote in the 
interest of Revelle. Vote for James 
Reiner. 

RAMON CESTERO 
REVELLE JUNIOR SENATOR 

During my tWO years as &student here at 
UCSD, I have noticed that a majority of 
the studenlS are not aware of what oc-
curs behind the closed doors of the 
Associated Students. Many do not know 
of the issues discussed which may di-
rectly or indirectly affecl them in vari-
ous ways. such u parking, monetary 
allotments, etc. I believe that as I repre-
sentative of Ihe studenl body • the duty of 
senator includes both conveying the 
SlUdents' view. and interests u well as 
informing them of the issues which 
concern them. If the students are not 
informed. how can an individual effec-
tively represent their views? One of my 
main lOW would be to let student1mow 
what is soma on and abo 10 obtain their 
vieWSOllIhe isaues whichconcem them.

MIKE CONNOR 
REVELLE JUNIOR SENATOR 

As a student representative, I will try to 
change the approach of the A.S. toward 
UC Regent policy. In the past. the AS 
has fought detrimental policies only in 
the fInal stages of their implementa-
tion. By that time it was too late to stop 
these policies. An example of this is the 
bke and skateboard policy. I feel there 
is a better way. In October oflast year, 
a "Master Plan" was completed by a 
consulting fllTll for the UC Regents. 
This plan sets up the growth and change 
of UCSD pas the year 2000. Now we, 
as students, have a chance to determine 
which parts of this plan are good and 
which parts we need to stop, before 
they are in effect. The new parking 
proposal is an example of this need for 
control. The Master Plan proposes that 
over In of the lots on the west end of 
campus be closed. As a replacement. a 
large lot will be built on the other side 
of the freeway. This would force 
Revelle students, including residents. 
to park 15 min. away from their car. 
There will be a shuttle but can we rely 
on that in an emergency? We need new 
parking. but not at the cost of existing 
parking. Another problem with the Plan 
involves tuming Revelle field into 
buildings. This would mean that Revelle 
students would be sharing Muir fields 
with both Muim and the intramural 
teams. My goal as the junior represen-
tative for Revelle is to stop these types 
of things from occurring. By looking to 
the future we can stop proposals from 
the Regents that are aginst our inter-
ests. We pay for this school and now 
we have the chance to make it the way 
wewanL

'There is too much of Ihe past that r do 
not wish to forget." Years from now, 
college life will be a fading memory 
filled with nostalgia for friends, fun. 
and fmaJ.s. I'd like everyone to remem-
ber UCSD IIld thus, I am willing to 
devote time to the student body because 
it is the force that controls the school. 
Communication is necessary to fulfill 
everyone's demlllds, and as Revelle 
Sophomore Senator, I hope to achieve 
just that. I will do my best to serve the 
Revelle Sophomore class by helping 
them keep the solid memory of good 
times at UCSD. 

DAVID BONDS 
TIDRD SENIOR SENATOR 

Over my first four years here at UCSD, 
many things have changed. Unfortu-
nately many of those changes have not 
been in the best interests of UCSD 
undergrads. For example, when I was a 
Freshman the price of a parking permit 
was S89.00 - today it costs SI44.00. 
Another issue I hope to further is the 
elimination of the "W" grade as well as 
extending Ihe date for the changing of 
the grading option. Finally, at Third I 
want to work with Provost Lytle to 
establish III Ethnic Studies Department 
while reforming the Third generaledua-
tion requirements. The A.S. can ac-
complish this, but only if you elect the 
BEST candidates. 

DINO DELFIERRO 
TIDRD COLLEGE SENIOR 

SENATOR 
Inregards to thisoffice.I have the desire 
and ample experience which enables 
me to excel at this position. Currently, I 
am the Third College Representative to 
the Par1cng Advisory Board. J was cho-
sen for this position because of my abil-
ity to represent a diverse number of 
studalts. Consequently, my duties as a 
Rep. required me to attend Third Col-
lege Council and Commuter Board 
meetings. This enabled me to become 
better acquainted with the processes 
involved in student government IJld 
also the needs of Third College Stu-
dents. Because of these achievements, I 
believe that I am well qualifIed for the 
position. 

LARRY BECKER 
TIDRD JUJIo'lOR SENATOR 

Are you getting what you are paying 
for in the Associated Students? The A.S . 
allocated nearly S680,OOO in the last 
year. What is perhaps more shocking is 
that they spent over S90,OOO juston A.S. 
Administration. Thus, they spend 
$90,000 just to allocate the other 
S590,OOO. 

A vote for Larry Becker for A.S . 
Third College Junior Senator is a vote 
for fIScal responsibility. By making 
many of the A.S. services and programs 
user - funded and by slashing the burau-
cracy, we can cut the A.S. budget. On 
April II, 12, IJld 13, tell the A.S. to 
spend less on itself and more on univer-
sity-wideevents like T.O.'s spending by 
any government must be checked and 
controlled. This is your chance to check 
the A.S. 

PATRICK FROST 
TIDRD SOPHOMORE SENATOR 
When dedicating oneself to a leadership 
posi tion, one must be adept in the re-
sponsibilities of a leader and in the 
concerns of his/her constituents. As a 
fresh person in Third College, I bring to 
this school vast experience as a leader. 
Involved in StudentOovernment in my 
past 6 years of school and elected to 2 
senatorialshlps in Calif omia Associated 
Students Council (CASC), I was also 
able to experience leadership in the 
United States Congress for I year when 
I worked as a Congressional Page. But 
hereatUCSD,myparticipatiioninTown 
Hall Meetings has familiarized me with 
the concerns of my fellow Third Col-
lege Students. My past experience and 
my familiarity with my own college has 
"warmed" me up to run for Third Col-
lege Sophomore Senator. "Warm up to 
Frost" and vote for Patrick Frost.

Schourer 
Continued from page IS 
two major problems UCSO faced 
this year, and what problems do 
you anticipate arising in the future, 
either specifically with Program-
ming, or in general? 
S: This year as far as Program-
ming, I didn't really see an involve-
ment with Jonathon [Judaken] in 
actually involving the students in 
the decision-making process. 

For example, with TGs it was 
like, a reggae band every TG or 
so, or at least it seemed like it. 
Some of the people I 've talked to 
have said, " Why isn't there any 
rock?" 
G: What are you going to do to 
solve these problems? 
S: I want to have somewhat of a 
synthests of having some close 
friends I can rely on, and also 
opening myself up to everyone, 
to decide what kind of bands and 
what kinds of events are going to 
be here. 
G: How would you go about find-
ing out what students want? 
S: Just right now in this campaign 
process, when I go up to people 
and ask them "What do you want 
as far as event ?" 

One way to do it is to go to the 
student organizations and see 
what programs they're after. 
G: What have you been finding 
out from people? 
S: It has either been that" Jona-
thon [Judaken] really sucked" or 
that he did a good job. Some peo-
ple say that they really like the 
reggae, and some people said that 
they wanted an alternative. 
G: What about other aspects of 
Programming, such as lectures? 

S: That's where I see the student 
organizations coming into play. 

I'm sure each organization ha 
their own group of people, and 
they're interested in what that 
group deal with, and by pre ent-
ing that as an event, not only do 
you get those people, but any-
body else who may be interested 
in that topic. 
G: 00 you have any plans for 
going beyond student fees for 
money to sponsor events? 
S: Well , there's Bill Silva and I'm 
not clear about this, I don 't know 
how much influence POP Events 
and the A .S. programmer have in 
deciding which bands come over 
here. 
G:Oo you have any qualms about 
whether bel:r companies should 
sponsor college events? 
S: Well, I myself don't drink, but I 
don't see anything wrong with it if 
you are old enough. Now with 
this TG referendum, I can see 
both side . 

One side is that it is my money 
that is going to someone else's 
beer, but on the other hand it is 
the money that goes for the TG , 
including the band, the beer and 
the Pepsi. I'm aware that the beer 
i an attracting factor to the TG . 
G: What are you r specific pLans 
for different or new programming 
next year? 
S: One of my ideas, in addition to 
the Reggae Fest ... is to have a 
sort ofa "Rock" Fest , forlack ofa 
better word, and also to continue 
the film series. I would intend to 
get better movies ... and adverti e 
it more.

Programming 

Guardian: What past actlvlttes 
have you been involved with that 
makes you the most qualified for 
this position? 
Valladao: Well , the All Night 
Party [sLate] is pretty much going 
into this with no experience. But, 
urn, we kinda want it that way 
because there's a lot of things that 
never get tried because of people, 
who, in experience, say it just 
can't be done. 

We're going to try a lot of dif-
ferent things and yeah, a lot of 
them probably won't work , but 
there'l probably be a lot that will 
and it could make life interesting. 

G: What would you identify as 
two major problems which UCSO 
faced thi year, and what prob-
lems do you anticipate ari ing 
next year, either specifically with 
Programming or in the school in 
general? 
V: One problem I found [was] the 
way money was spent. Johnny 
[Jonathon Judaken] eemed reall y 
interested in the concerts and he 
let mo t everything slip , mainly 
the A .S . film series . 

I'd like a bigger diversity of 
groups that play TGs or school 
events. It seems we've discovered 
this year how many time Barra-
cho Y Loco and the Card iff Reef-
ers can play at thi school. I'd like 
to bring something like some rock 
or funk - more diverse music. 
G: What would you do with TGs 
in the future? 
V: I do want TGs because they are 
one of the only things that really 
work as school-related events.

I do want to keep the alcohol 
becau e thi is the question I 
would like to po e: " Did you go to 
either of the non-a lcoholic TGs, 
and if you did , did you have fun?" 

If you answered "no" to either 
of these quest ions, you are cor-
rect. [Alcohol is] one of the big 
draws of the TGs to getting that 
many people there .... 

If you try to put the money that 
is spent o n that in some other 
kind of draw to get peo ple there 
like bigger bands, it st ill won't 
b ring as many people. 
G: If someone in the administra-
tion finally d ecide that there isn't 

going to be beer at the TGs, doe 
that mean Programming will fall 
apart? 
V: I think it would, I mea n I'd try 
putting that money into better 
bands, maybe free food , maybe 
pizza. Nothing is going to draw 
the way free beer does. 

It would be a tough thing to 
keep that program alive with that 
many people participating with-
out 'the alcohol. 
G: 0 where does that leave you? 
V: I'm going to fight for the beer 
all the way. 
G: What type of things would 
you do? 
V: Student petition drives, I mean 
orne of the students just need to 

have a wift kick in the ass of what 
to do. I mean this is one of the 

mo t disorganized schools I've 
ever seen. 

ince I've been here the admin-
istra tion has just constantly been 
taking things away and nobody 
fights for it .... I think a litt le civil 
disobedience i necessary, and I 
will be behind it all the way . 
G: Do you have a ny specific goals 
for next year, any changes in

V: Well, Anthony (Waldichu k) 
came up with the Inter-campus 
Brady Bunch Trivia Contest , and 
we're thin king of offering the win-

I came into a position that had 
not been es tablished and was 
asked to take overtheircomputer

in two ways : o ne , I had the expe-
rience of stepping into something 
that I'm not 100 percent familiar 
with; and, two, the computer 
experience. 
G: What would you identify as 
two major problems which have 
faced UCSD this yea r, a nd what

S: [T he A.S.] has been trying to 
increa e the profits made from 
some of the e organizations t ha t 

We also need to look at social 
life on campus .. . 1 am really for a 
lot of school spirit and a lot of 
events on-campus. 
G: How would you go a bout 
establishing communications be-
tween yourself and the operations, 
se rvices a nd enterprises? 
S: I would ho ld strict office hours 
to a nalyze a ny p ro blems [the 
ma nagers] are having. But you 
just can't sit back a nd wait fo r 
people to come to you, because it 
just won't ha ppen.

wit h the managers of the operati-

meet at lunch and talk over t heir 
problems and esta blish a working

sure they are properly advertised .

that is losing money?

GUllTdian: What activities have 
you been involved with in the past 
a nd how have t hese qualified you 
for t he positio n of commissioner 
of operations, services a nd enter-
prises? 
Edwards: I was really active on 
the [Jesse] J ackson campaign, 
putt ing in like 30 hours a week 
... I'm a member of the Califor-
nia Alliance of Progressive Stu-
dent Activists, a statewide network 
of students. 

My experiences lies in promot-
ing student empowerment. There's 
a difference between student rights 
and student empowerme nt. When 
people ta lk about student rights 
you think about students' rights 
to have sma ll class sizes, the right 
to more office hours or someth ing 
like that. I would say that stude nt 
empowerment is needed . [If] there 
is some sort of academic senate 
committee which decides how many 
classes profs should teach and 
how many office hours should be 
standard, there should be students 
on that committee so tha t stu-
dents are helping to make policy.

SPECIAL ELECTION COVERAGE 

G: Why a re you runni~g for 
commiss ione r of operat ions, ser-
vices and enterprises a nd not stu-
dent advocate or president? 
E: Well, aside from Programming, 
I guess it's one of the only specifi c 
positions where you a re actually 
serving students. It should be done 
in a democratic way serving the 
majority of students. [ For in-
stance] it's nice to have a record 
store ... but [the A.S .] sunk a bout 
$50,000 into it and then a nother 
$ 10,000. And things like lecture 
notes which I think are probably 
more basic student services are 
not funded as they should be. We 
have $60,000 going to Assorted 
Vinyl when I have frie nds going 
to classes with 100 students and 
they can't get A.S . Lecture Notes 
because [the A.S.] says they will 
lose money on it. 

If we were to lose $5,000 a year 
on lecture notes I don't think it 
would be that big a deal, but to 
sink $60,000 into As orted Vi-
nyl. .. 
G: How would you decide which 
lectures should be covered by the 
A.S. Lecture Notes? 
E: It i a good idea that larger 
classes be covered fi rst. Aside 
from that, ask CAP E (Course 
and Professor Evaluations) to put 
something on t here li ke, " Would 
you buy A.S. Lecture Notes if 
they were offered for th is course?" 
and next time that course came 
up the [A .S .] could take that into 
co nsideration. 
G: How do you th ink the Price 
Center will affect students? 
E: Students don't rea lly have a 
voice in how that t hing is run. I 
have a class a t the Price Center 
Auditorium a nd there are no 
blackboard s. It 's got nice plants, 
n ice sea ts, nice carpeting. It 's set 
up for management trainee con-
ferences and things like that. It's 
not set up for classes, it 's not set 
up for student conferences, we're 
the one 's footing the b ill .. . it 
should have been done much 
d ifferently.

G: What can students do to bring 
about change? 
E: The A. S. should be working to 
try to get more students onto 
committees. Try to mobilize stu-
dents to pack meetings. To pack 
them with students who are 
orderly, but who are upset. Since 
[the administration] doesn't like 
bad press, they might do some-
thing about it. 
G: Do you have any ideas for new 
operations, services or enterpri es? 
E: A 24-hour tudy space - at 
least from the third week on. 
There is a lot oflibrary space. The 
major concern would be protec-
tion . Maybe a police officer or

COMMISSIONER 

university center board 

GA YATRJ L. GUNASEKARAN 
University Center Board 

Guardian: What past activities 
have you been involved with that 
specifically make you most quali-
fied for this po ition? 
Gunasekaran: As a freshman I 
served as Third College senator 
and I've served a year on UCB 
(U niversity Center Board) as 
sophomore senator this year. 

I also served as chair for the 
[Price Center] Grand Opening 
Committee. So, in the strictest 
sense, that's what qualifies me. 
Guardian: What would you iden-
tify as two major problems that 
UCSD faced last year, and what 
problems do you anticipate aris-
ing next year either specifically in 
the UCB, and the A.S. or the 
school in general? 
G: What I am always upset about 
is that students are never guaran-
teed to get their classes. Most of 
the time you end up crashing and 
to me that's terrible. 

Some of the professors really 
care, but a lot of the time you 
don't get to see them. The fact is 
that undergraduates aren't put 
first. 
GuardiJln: How, in the position 
UCB chair, are you going to solve 
these problems? 
G: I think that as UCB chair I 
couldn't really have a direct affect 
on academics per se, but I think 
that the Price Center and the Stu-
dent Center could provide places 
where students can have a chance 
to add to their academic capa-
bilities. 

We as a board (UCD) really 
can't do .anything about the aca-
demics, but we make sure that the 
rest of their experience is a little 
better. 
Guardian: Is there anything you 
would initiate that would help the 
academic problems? 
G: I could try to do that on A.S., 
but I would have to say that my 
first responsibility as UCD chair 
would be to make sure that the 
Price Center and the Student 
Center would be working very, 
very well before I started looking 
at the academic side of things. 
Guardilln: If elected you will be 
the first UCB chair in office with 
the Price Center in full swing. 
Given its commercial quality, how 
are you going to maintain and 
improve the old Student Center 
in the interests of co-ops and 
enterprises? 
G: I've sort of felt the fear the 
co-ops have that they think they 
will be neglected once we open the 
Price Center, and Ilort of see it as 
analogous to when parents have a 
new baby and for a while all the 

NEW Monday, April 10, 1989 25 
SPECIAL ELECTION COVERAGE 

attention is centered on the new 
baby. 

But, that doesn't mean that 
you're going to forget about the 
old child .. . it's just that "giving 
birth" is a difficult process. 

We're not going to neglect the 
Student Center in any way shape 
or form . . .1 can assure them that 
there is no need or no reason to 
feel threatened. 
GUllrdian: In the past, the UCD 
chair has been criticized as a "tool 
of the administration." How are 
you going to see to it that you are 
not a voice for administrative 
goals and wants? 
G: I would not be a voice for 
administrative wants because J 
would have to be a schizophrenic 
at that point. 

I'm a student and I care about 
students, and I don't spend my 
time on UCD because I want to 
voice the administration's con-
cerns. I sit on UCD because I want 
students to be better represented. 

Ifthere were any chance of that 
happening (voicing administrative 
concerns), I would just have to 
keep my eyes and ears open and 
ask pertinent questions .. . you find 
out what's going on. 
GUllrdian: How do you stand on 
the co-op referendum? 
G: I read over it. .. it sound like 
[the co-ops] are worried that UCB 
isn't going to take care of them 
anymore - that all of a sudden 
we're going to forget them. That 
is not the case. 

If I felt that UCB was going to 
forget about the co-ops, that we 
did not care about them, then I 
would have to say "yeah, vote 
'yes' on the co-op referendum," 
but I reaUy don't see that is going 
to be the case, and I personally 
don't have commitment to forget-
ting about the co-ops. 

So, I'm not going to vote for 
the co-op referendum because I 
personally have a commitment to 
making the Student Center great 
and making the Price Center great. 
Gunaskaran is a Third College 
sophomore majoring in litera-
ture / writing. 
JASON CARBONE 
University Center Board 

GUllrdian: What past activities 
have you been involved with that 
make you more qualified than 
your opponent? 
Carbone: This year I'm the Muir 
College representative tothe Uni-
versity Center Board [UCBl The 
year before I was the student-at-
large on the Retail and Services 

accessi ble person, and when some-
one has an idea 111 be the first 
person to move forward with the 
idea and see if it's feasible. 

Number two, I think I'm going 
to try a number of things with 
[UCB] funds so that we can in-
crease student awareness of not 
only what is offered here at the 
University, but also what, as stu-
dents, we are basically paying for 
and should utilize. 
G: If elected , You will be the first 
UCB commissioner in office with 
the Price Center in full swing. 
Given its commercial quality, how 
are you going to ensure that the 
current Student Center is main-
tained with the non-commercial 
interests of the co-ops and enter-
prises? 
C: That is a very good question. 
Number one, it is important to 
realize that over the summer the 
current Student Center is going to 
get a much ne-eded renovation of 
a half million dollars, and in 
doing so, we are going to be 
expanding all the existing co-ops 
in size and space. 

I think that it is important as 
UCB chair that we recognize that 
the Price Center is going to be 
very commercial and so we keep 
in mind that the co-ops and enter-
prises exist not only for the benefit 
of students, but because there are 
a number of students that are 
actively involved in all of these 
organizations. 
G: In the past, it's been said the 
position of UCB chair is a "tool of 
the administration." How do you 
intend to direct The Board towards 
student goals instead of admini-
strative goals? 
C: Everybody has their own 
agenda. The University has its 
own agenda, and I, as a student 
running for [UCB] commissioner, 
have my own agenda . Being 
[UCB] commissioner means I can 
set my own agenda for what 
happens at those meetings. 

I think it's important for tu-
dents to realize that there is a 
voice, and if elected, ... I'm going 
to be listening to students, not the 
administration.

year student majoring in visual

I've had a working knowledge 
of[UC8] now for two years, and 
this year I've been involved in a 
number of projects ranging from 
the poster that's coming out for 
the [Price Center] Grand Open-
ing to helping hire the assistant 
director for the new building. 
G: What would you identify as 
two problems that UCSD faced 
this year, and what problems do 
you anticipate arising next year, 
specifically in the UCB, the A.S. 
or the school in general? . 
C: One, I think students are sick 
and tired of reading about A.S. 
bickering in the Guardian. 

Every week we see letters to 
and from [members] who are 
angry with each other. [Council 
members] should stop biclcering 
amongst themselves and just do 
it. 

The second big issue ranges 
from our fees going up to night-
time parlcing permits. It seems 
that the students tluit go to this 
school don't have a say in what 
happens; it seems the all-mighty 
dollar rules and that dollar hap-
pens to come from graduate funds. 
G: How do you plan to improve 
or slIlve these problems?

KISONG 
Muir Senior SeIUl'or 

Guarditln: What are the two most 
important issues you feel next 
year's A . Council must address? 

ong: 1 want to provide some 
type of budget bulletin for the 
Muir students, so they know 
where their fees are being allo-
cated. My second goal is to get 
this school more involved with 
the University itself. 

In addition to that, what r can 
do is provide a suggestion box 
which would give the students 
input. Students are your best 
re ources. I also want to provide 
some type of academic services 
for the students who work and 
don't have the time to go to their 
academic advisor. I want to pro-
vide an answering service where 
they can call and ask questions. 

They could leave their name 
and number and someone could 
or I could, find out the exact regu~ 
lations regarding general educa-
tion, their major, minor, things of 
that sort. I think that would be a 
convenience for the students. 
G: If elected, how do you plan on 
keeping in touch with people in 
your college who are not politi-
cally active or outspoken? 
S: I'm going to provide a sugges-
tion box at the Price Center. 
[Boxes will al 0 be] at key places 
in HL and in every [house advi-
sor's] or[resident advisor's] room. 
At the end of the week, we'd col-
lect those and go through them to 
ee which ones seem more ap-

plicable. 
Students are the best resources 

they know what they want. If 
there's a majority of a topic that 
they want to proceed into, 111 do 
the best I can.

JOE FLOREN 

Guardian: What are the two most 
important issues you feel next 
year's A.S. Council must address? 
Floren: I would say one of the 
issues is protecting the co-ops 
from the administration, protect-
ing them and helping to expand 
the co-ops. 

WhIlt is it~ 

I don't think they should just 
try and gouge the students for 
money. It just seems that the 
administration, for whatever rea-
son, likes to deal with corpora-
tions rather than with student . 

One thing that hasn't been ad-
dressed at all [by the Council] that 
I'd like to mention is the "W" 
grade. At schools like Stanford, 
you can drop up until the day of 
the final and not get a "W." One 
of the BEST slate issues is to get 
rid of the "W" grade entirely. 

We'd also like to push back the 
last time to change the grading 
option from pass / no pa s to letter 
grade until after the first midterm 
... The way it is right now is that 
there isn't a point in having the 
ability to even change it, because 
nobody's got their grades yet 
[when the deadline arrives]. 
G: If elected, how do you plan on 
keeping in touch with people in 
your college who are not politi-
cally active or outspoken? 
F: Just by talking to people and 
sort of getting a feel for what's in 
the neighborhood. One way to do 
it would be, I work in the Muir 
Cafeteria, to talk to some of the 
people who come in there, talk to 
people in classes. I like to talk to 
people about politic , and even 
when they're not interested in it, I 
try to get their views 0 1 can find 
out what's important to people. 
Floren is a Muir College senior 
majoring in political science. 
STEVE NETZLEY 
Muir Senior Senator 

GUllTditut: What are the most 
important issues you feel next 
year's A.S. Council must address? 
Netzley: In the area of academic 
relations with the administration 
... UCSD has several character-
istics that are not something that 
I'd like to brag about. Such as, 
one, we have the highest drop 
r.ate, of classes, of any of the 
schools in the UC system. And, 
number two, it takes longer for a 
UC San Diego student to gradu-
ate than it does for any other stu-
dent in the UC System. 
. There are two major points I'd 

like to address on this - one is 
we are not allowed to drop c1asse~

N: If you have these events, say 
noontime concerts, you can 
address people prior to a concert,-
.. . people who aren't necessarily 
politically aware. Muir dorms are 
kind of unique, also, in the fact 
that they're one solid building, 
and they have these suite rep 
meetings, so )<ou can basically 
have a voice to everybody in the 
dorms through a suite rep meet-
ing that you can meet with.

MARK VAN DlERENDONCK 
Muir Senior SelUitor 

GUlITdilUl: What are the two most 
important issues you feel next 
year's A.S. Council must address? 
Van Dierendonck: Just keeping 
the TGs around for one thing. 
The most important question is 
the question about the adminis-
tration kind of taking things away 
from the students. In parking, 
they've moved students way out 
on the outskirt of the campus. 
They've taken the Pub away more 
or les . 

[Other issues include] expen es 
such as parking, books. I don't 
know if the A.S. can really do 
anything about that. I understand 
there's some kind of state law that 
says the state of California ca nnot 
use educational funds to build 
parking lots, they have to be self-
supported, but by the same token 
they build buildings on top of 
existing parking lots, and when 
they do that they should basically 
buy the parking lot that they just 
took away and build it some-
where else. 
G: If elected, how do you plan on 
keeping in touch with people in 
your college who are not politi-
cally active or outspoken? 
V: Just hang out in front of 
M.O.M .... The way I kind of stay 
in touch is just by reading the 
Guardian. If someone writes in a 
letter and something like "Muir 
Senior Senator" is printed beneath 
it, occa ionalIy, 1 read it. If the 
new Price Center Round Table 
Pizza place turns out well, some-
how we can organize some kind 
of bulletin board there or some-
thing like that where people can

COLIN "RED" DONAHOE 
Muir Senior Senator 

GUllrdian: What are the most 
important i sues you feel next 
year's A.S. Council must address? 
Donahoe: One of them is park-
ing, I think, e pecially the night-
time parking proposal. The second 
one is probably fees ... I'd like to 
lobby for a freeze in fee hikes ... in 
particular, UCSD campus-based 
fees . 

On parking - first of all, the 
nighttime parking proposal should 
be reversed, because 1 know for a 
fact that . at least for tudents at 
Muir, the parking is inadequate 
for the residents t here. We ',-e going 
to have to get a committee and 
lobby the parking committee, and 
we stand a good chance of doing 
that. 
G: If elected, how do you plan to 
keeping in touch with people in 
your college who are not politi-

D: Well next year I'm hoping to 
be a house advisor as well, so I 
keep in touch with residents really 
well, as a house advisor. 1 also 
know a lot of people off campus, 
because I was a transfer orienta-
tion leader, and basically have a 
lot of contacts with a lot of peo-
ple. What I plan on doing is hav-

ing some sort of office hours 
available, at Muir campus; and to 
get three or four people working 
with me as, like, feelers ... to help 
me out.

MUIR COLLEGE 

junior senator 
KATHY OH 
Muir Junior Senator 

Guardian: What are the two most 
important issues you feel next 
year's A.S . Council mu t address? 
Oh: 1 feel that the two mo t 
important issues that the A.S. 
must address next year are the 
fact that there's a lack of access to 
student information and admin-
istrative bureaucracy. In a way 
they're interrelated in that because 
students are uninformed the 
[UCSD] administration is taking 
advantage of that by passing legis-
lation that adversely affect stu-
dents, and students can't fight 
that because they don't know 
their rights. Some examples are 
the nighttime parking policy and 
the fee increase. Because students 
are uninformed of their rights, 
they can't fight the administration 
effectively. 

As senator, I wanted to use the 
media that's already offered to us 
such as the Guardian, the college 
papers, and KSDT [to inform 
tudent ]. 

After informing student , I was 
thinking about getting a commit-
tee together between the adminis-
tration and students so that they 
both know what's going on and 
they both know what each other 
wants ... This will by my number

If you are dating the right 
person? 

one priority. 
G: If elected, how do you plan on 
keeping in touch with people in 
your college who are not politi-
cally active or outspoken? 
0: By using different organiza-
tions . I know that there are a lot 
of cultural organizations as well 
as academic. I think by contact-
ing the pre idents and the people 
who are active within that group, 
and letting them know what their 
rights are, and like I said before, 
just using the media that is offered 
to us.

VANESSA MAY 
Muir Junior Senator 

Guardian: What are the two most 
important issues you feel next 
year's A.S. Council must address? 
May: One of the issues deals with 
night parking and the other issue 
deals with the tax fee hike of stu-
dent fees . 

If nighttime parking really does 
come to be, I think we're going to 
need a lot more police enforce-
ment just to make it safe for 
commuter students. Some people 
still won't be able to afford to 
have a parking permit for the 
nighttime, too, and unle s you 
want to keep on putting money in 
your meter, you might want to 
park a little bit off-campus. If you 
have to walk from on-campus to 
off-campus at night, that might 
be somewhat dangerous. 

[There are] some things going 
on in Sacramento this weekend, 
called Spring Action, and a lot of 
students from around the state 
are going to go up there and lobby 
for different things. They're also 
going to say their views on ths 10 
percent fee hike. The UCSA will 

• • 

also address that issue. 0 maybe 
we can get more people involved 
in the UCSA so that we'l have a 
bigger say in what goes on. 
G: If elected, how do you plan on 
keeping in touch with people in 
your college who are not politi-
cally active or outspoken? 
M: It would be nice if Muir Col-
lege Council would ask for more 
student input. I want to get a real 
varied account of what juniors 
feel. It would be nice if we could 
have a town junior meeting or 
junior council meeting where 
people come in who are juniors at 
Muir and discuss their gripes and 
grievances ... For those people 
who are apathetic, I really feel we 
can make an effort to show them 
that if they do put their input in, 
they can change things.

GOLDA BENDAH 
Muir Junior Senator 

Guardian: What are the two most 
important issues you feel next 
year's A.S . Council must address? 
Kendah: I think that one of the 
things the A.S. should do is have 
more events. It seems like the stu-
dent body is so segregated. There's 
nothing other than the TGs that 
unites everybody. The Sun God 
Festival is a great idea, though. I 
really want to motivate people 
that aren't participating in these 
A.S. events more. 

Right now I think the A.S. is 
doing a great job. There was a 
thing about the TGs, that they 
might stop them and I think that 
would be a shame because TGs 
are the one thing that everybody 
likes to do. It's not like you have 
to invite anybody. Everybody's 
invited. Nobody's excluded. That's 

the best thing about it, nobody is 
excluded. 

I think the A.S. should make 
some inter-collegiate type [activi-
ties). Maybe some type of sports 
event where all the college would 
get together and compete or not 
even compete but just get together. 
G: If elected, how do you plan on 
keeping in touch with people in 
your college who are not politi-
cally active or outspoken? 
B: I'd always be available. I always 
make [my schedule] so that I'm 
not inaccessible. It's impossible to 
go up to every student and bring 
them into whatever event is ~oing 
on, but I'd really like it if I got 
their input. If they don't like how 
something is run, I want to know 
because the most important thing 
is the input of the Muir College 
tudents.

AGUSTIN OROZCO Jr. 
Muir ophomore Senator 

Gutlrdian: What are the two most 
important issues you feel next 
year's A.S. Council mu t address? 
Orozco: Parking, definitely - I've 
heard things a bout it from people 
in the A.S . going both ways, say-
ing that they want it , and why 
they want it . lliveon campus, but 
being a commuter, it would be 
really hard for me to pay for park-
ing, if I came at night , to pay for 
night parking a well. I'm not sure 
where I stand on that now, but 1 
think 1 would probably vote 
against night parking. 

The fee hike that they're talking 
about. .. is another hard one, too, 
because you've got the faculty 
and everyone else saying, "we 
want them to go up," and the stu-
dents saying. "want the prices to 
stay the same" ... Of course, being 
a tudent , l don't want to pay any 
more than anybody else does. 
G: If elected, how do you plan on 
keeping in touch with people in 
your college who are not politi-

0: I live on campus ... so, beingat 

Muir, if I get elected, a lot ofpeo-
pIe will know who I am. I will try 
to make myself as visible as pos-
sible, and to keep in contact with 
people. The be t way, for me 
would be to attend ... the residence 
council meetings. 

The ones who are really not 
outspoken, just go walk around 
the dorm , and try to meet as 
many people as I can, and try and 
keep in close contact with people 
that I already know, to ee what 
they feel needs to be done and see 
what I can do about thal.

ALYSSA HENRY 
Muir Sophomore Senator 

Gutlrdian: What are the most 
important issues you feel next 
year's A.S. Council must address? 
Henry: I feel I would like to 
address the night parking per-
mits, for one thing, because I 
don't believe we should have any 
night parking permits; and, I 
think, more funds towards the 
athletic facilities, the P .E. de-
partment, is important. I think it's 
an important pan of campus life 
here, and at the rate we're going, 
there are going to be less and less 
P.E. teachers and activities. 

Asa senator . .. my main objec-

tive is to get the students' interest 
i my college, so they have a 
chance to say what they want the 
A.S. to do, instead of the A.S.just 
going ahead and doing stuff. 

I think almost everybody run-
ning would like to have no night 
parking, and the co-ops stay open, 
and more funds for various parts 
of the campus; but I think ... what 
the sophomore senator should 
be, is a middleman to the A.S. 
G: If elected, how do you plan on 
keeping in touch with people in 
your college who are not politi-
cally active or outspoken? 
H: I am very open to everyone's 
suggestions .. .1 would put up a 
suggestion box, I would be in my 
room certain times if people 
wanted to come talk to me. Or, 
I'm around campus ... 111 be out-
side, and 111 ask people if they 
have any suggestions for the A.S. 
It's odd to me that I pick up a 
Guardian, and read what the A.S. 
decided, and I had no idea they 
had come up with it. 

The only thing I could do [spe-
cifically to reach commuter stu-
dents] is , visit the cloud's rest 
. .. and even have a ugge tion 
box in there.

JOSHUA D. GROSS 
Muir Sophomore Senator 

GlUlrdUut: What are the two most 
important issues you feel next 
year's A.S. Council must address? 
Gross: lthink the most important 
issue is going to be the rising fees . 
What we're going to have to do is 
lobby every single government 
agency, as in the State Senate, 
House, and the UC Regents, to 
keep the fees down. My plan has a 
fees freeze, which would hold the 
line right where we are for the 
next three years. 

The other most important thing 
that we've got to take a look at is 
parking . .. 1 have to park here 
every day, and there's not enough 
space to park; we've raised the 
parking permit rate 70 percent in 
the last three years, and not one 
new space has been built .. . 

I think the A.S. Council, as I 
said with the fees, is going to have 
to worle to lobby the State Senate 
and the State House for funds for 
this kind of thing. You've got to 
talk to who's in charge, and as far 
as I'm concerned, the State Senate 
is who's in charge .

Just thinking about college tuition is 
enough to make most parents break into 
a sweat. 

BuLcan you blame them? When you 
consicter the cost of tuition, books, 
dorms- not to mention pizza parties-
you're talking big bucks. 

Which is why you should do some 
talking. Like telling your parents about 
the Education Loan Programs at 
Manufacturers Hanover Trust. 

At MHT, not only do we participate 
in all three Federally guaranteed loan 
programs, but we Alsu work with state 
and national agencies and can make 
guaranteed loans in all 50 states. 

In practically no time.llt all. 
In a matter of minutes, MHT Student 

Loan Processors can program your 
information into our computerized loan-
proce sing system. 

Within 24 hours, the Bank will get a 
decision from the Guarantee Agency. 
ft's thatsimple. Better still , with MHT 
your parents will get all the money they 
need frum one source. ' 

Example: [fyour folks need more 
money than government sources will 
give them, we can offer them tailor-made 
payment plans through The Education 
Loan Program, Educational Lines of 
Credit or Monthly Budget Program and 
Pre-Payment Programs that make it 
easy for your parents to fund themselves. 
(The Education Loan Program, Monthly 
Budget and Pre-Payment Programs are 
offered through the Tuition Plan, a 
company of Manufaclurers Hanover.) 

Once you get a loan from us, you can 
be sure it'll stay with us. Because we've 
never sold education loans to other 
banks (unless the borrower asked us to). 

So if you need money for school, call 
1-800-MHT-G RAD and get you rsel f 
an MHT Education Loan Application . 

Then when you r folks ask you about 
tuition, at least yOU'll have an answer.

JAMES REINER 
Revelle Junior Senator 

Guardian: What are the two most 
important issues that are going to 
face the A.S. Council next year? 
Reiner: The administration's seem-
ingly lack of concern for the stu-
dents at UCSD. 

It seems to me that right now 
they're really concerned with build-
ing up the place and they're con-
cerned with research, whereas it's 
an institution of learning and 
they've seemingly forgotten under-
graduate students, which is the 
whole purpose for the University : 
ed ucation. 

[The second] i somethi ng that 
Revelle students seem to want. 
It's not as big of a concern to 
other colleges, but lately all of our 
Humanities cla ses, which is a 
Revelle-only class, usually have 
been held over in Third Lecture' 
Hall and Peterson Hall . 
G: That leads right into the second 
Question. How do you plan on

dents in your college that aren't

that we have a newspaper called 
Revellalions, which is just for 
Revelle, and I was hoping that I 
could work with them and tell

Personally I've experienced it 
every morning coming back from 
work at 9:30 in the morning; 1 
can't find a parking spot, [and I] 
can't get to class. 

Another one I think A.S. will 
have to consider is expanding the 
range of social events we have on 
this campu . I feel that we are 
limited here, and a lot of people 
are not enjoying themselves here, 
and I feel there should be a wider

important issues you feel next 
year's A .S. Council must address? 
Murray: An important issue I feel 
for Revelle is to press for the 
establishment of an ethnic studies 
department, because right now 
we're taking Humanities, and 
[studying] Western civilization 
isn't a great preparation for our 
society today. 

It's a little more culturally di -
verse than that . They press you 
about being a Renaissance per-
son, and they don't realize that 
there's much more to your society 
than just the Western power right 
now. Humanities isjust not good. 

What I'm about and what BEST 
is about is student empowerment, 
and an important issue with this 
year's A.S. is the parking issue. 

We need beller representation 
on the parking advisory commit-
tee. We only have eight students 
out of 22 people, but we pay for 
over half of the money, The A.S. 
just needs to be more on top of it . 
G: If elected, how do you plan on 
keeping in touch with people in 
your college who are not politi-
cally active or outspoken? 
M: It doesn 't really strike me as 
that hard to keep in touch with 

them. The R.A.s are perfectly wil-
ling to let me talk to people dur-
ing the dorm meetings ... so I 
think this is a good way to keep in 
touch with them. 
G: Why are you running for the 
office? 
M: Because I think I can do a 
good job. I think I'm interested 
enough. I think I can do a lot on 
A.S.

DELPHINE LEE 
RenDe Sophomore Senator 

GlUlrdian: What are the two most 
important issues you feel next 
year's A.S. Council must address? 
Lee: I would say they would deal 
with the huge issue about beer at 
the TGs, and then parking. I 
think that [the solutions] are really 
up to the students more than any-
thing else, and I feel that the most 
important thing for A.S. to do is 
to find out what the students feel. 

I feel that we should conunue 
serving beer at the TGs ... fir t of 
all, it continues tradition; second 
of all, it provides a social outlet at 
this school, which is not very pre-
va lent. I feel that the parking 
situation is just a problem, period. 
G: If elected, how do you plan on 
keeping in touch with people in 
your college who are not politi-
cally active or outspoken? 
L: Most of the people that I will 
be representing will be living in 
the Revelle apartments, or possi-
bly, in the dorms. 

What I would like to do is put 
up flyers every month about what 
we are doing in A.S. , what I am 
doing in A.S ., and a way to get in 
touch with me. 

Right now I don't even know 
who is representing me, and I 
think that's wrong. 
G: Why are you running for the 
office? 
L: I really want to make a differ-
ence. J want to see things change, 
and I want to have something to 
do with it.

son majoring in biophysics. 
PAMELA PAEK 
ReveDe Sophomore Senator 

GUllrdian: What are the two most 
important issues you feel ~next 
year's A.S. Council must address? 
Paek: Weill don't know. I'm not 
really for or against the TGs that 
are held on Fridays, and I believe 
that it's up to the A.S. to com-
municate with the students, and if 
that 's what they want then it's for 
us to provide. 

Parkingwise ... I know that a 
lot of students are really against 
[night-time permits], and I don't 
know how much control the A.S. 
has about that. 
G: If elected, how do you plan on 
keeping in touch with people in 
your college who are not politi-
cally active or outspoken? 
P: I live in a dorm, and I'm in 
touch with people [there] almost 
all the time. I don't feel I have any 
problems going around from 
dorm to dorm; I know lots of 
people in the dorms. 

I think that it's important for 
the communication process to be 
open between A.S. and students, 
and I'd just go around from dorm 
to dorm and ask them what 
exactly they want. 
G: Why are you running for the 
office?

Continued from page 29 
P: I've heard lots of gripes from 
freshmen and sophomore around 
campus and around the dorm 
area saying that their thoughts 
don't get heard through A.S .... if 
o many people feel opposed to 

A.S. that's not really good because 
they control the school.

DA YID WESLEY BONDS 
Third Senior Senator 

Guardian: What are the two most 
important issues you feel next 
year's A.S. Council must address? 
Bonds: One thing, particularly for 
Third College, they still have a 
committee looking into changing 
the name of Third College to 
Lumumba Zapata College ... 
that's perhaps not a monumen-
tally important issue, but I think

to a lot of students at Third Col-
lege it's important. As far as 
campus-wide issues, I feel pretty 
strongly about the grading option 
- if there's a way we ca n at least 
alter the date for the "W" grade 
and the Pass/ No Pass grades. I 
think it would save a lot of people 
from completely dropping the 
c1as . 

G: If elected, how do you plan on 
keeping in touch with people in 
your college who are not politi-
cally active or out poken? 

B: I'm a senior this year and I've 
been living on-campus, I think 
I've gotten involved with a lot of 
students that way. I'm involved in 
MEChA, I was a TA for two 
C1as es of math in fall quarter, I 
worked in OASIS last quarter, 
and I got to talk to a lot of stu-
dents, and I got to talk to a lot of 
people in A.S. 

DINO B, DEL FIERRO 
Third Senior Senator 

Guardian: What are the two mo t 
important issues you feel next 
year's A.S. Council must address? 

Del Fierro: Issues t hat pertain to 
Third College would be the 20th 

an niver ary of Third College, 
which is comi ng up. I think we 
need to inform tdents more, I 
don't think that people know 
about the 20th anniversary, even 
Third College students. They don't 
realize how long Third has been 
here, or what Third has done. 

I think minorities need to be 
better represented in student gov-
ernment. A topic that I think A.S. 
needs to deal with is community 
involvement ... j ust support in 
general from the community so 
that UCSDcangrowandprosper. 

Maybe we can send out a news-
letter to a local newspaper like 
the Union or the Tribune and 
have a section reserved for UCSD. 
G:lf elected, how do you plan on 
keeping in touch with people in 
your college who are not politi-
cally active or outspoken? 
0: I think the best way that we 
can keep tudents informed is the 
Guardian. Everybody on campus 
reads the Guardian, more so than 
other publications. 

I that it's important to get opin-
ions of .the students. I think we 
should keep in touch with the 
[Resident Advisors] because I 
think they're a vital link to stu-
dent opinions and attitudes on a 
lot of is ues. 

Another way is through, l'd ay 
the biggest organization on cam-
pus is the Greek System. You can 
get a lot of different views on mat-
ters that deal with school. 

Besides the Guardian, I think 
we should send A.S. minutes to 
the .different college councils, to 
the provosts and deans of each 
college, and to different depart-
ments.

LA WRENCE BECKER 
Third Junior Senator 

Guardilln: What are the two most 
important i sues you feel next 
year's A.S. Council mu t address? 
Becker: I think the most impor-
tant issue is the fact that in the 
A.S . they're spending huge 
amounts of money; I think out of 
general unallocated they spent 
some $680,000 last year. Yet , at 
the same time they don't have any 
office or any kind of apparatus 
within the A.S. to raise funds. 

I think it's just a disgrace that 
they're not looking for other wa ys 
to save the students money and to 
raise funds and 1 also think that of 
that $680,000, there was a lot of 
waste. T hey spent $90,000 just on 
the administration of the A.S ... . 
that's too much. 

AI 0, I'd like to see some kind 
of institution set up so that. .. of-
ficers in the A.S. can have a better 
chance at communication with 
the students, becausejust the A.S. 
Bulletin that's in the Guardian I 
don't think is enough, although it 
helps. 
G.' If elected, how do you plan on 
keeping in touch with people in 
your college who are not politi-
cally active or o utspoken? 
B: I'd like to see the A.S. put 
together a newsletter of their own, 
or something. I think part of the 
blame isn 't just on the students, 
it's also on the senators them-
selve . If there' something really 
important going on , I think if a 
senator feels a certain way, he has 
something to gain by having a lot 
of students who feel the same way 
there at the meeting with him. 
Becker is a Third College sopho-
more majoring in political science. 

THIRD COLLEGE 

sophomore senator 
PATRICK FROST 
Third Sophomore Senator 

GUJlrdian: What are the two most 
important issues you feel next 
year's A.S. Council must address? 
Frost: One of them's probably 
going to be parking, and the 
econd one I think is going to be 

the TGs. It seems like thanl be the 
two big ones. I don 't think we 
should have to buy weekend 
passe . I think it would keep peo-
ple off the campus, which I don't 
think i a good idea. 

As for the TGs, I don't know, 
it's a tough choice. It does sort of 
seem to be favored toward the 
people that are 2 1 and over, but 
then again it's a big part of the 
social part of this campus. I think 
that the people who go, enjoy 
themselves whether they drink or 
not. 

G: If elected , how do you plan on 
keeping in touch with people in 
your collc:ge who are not politi-
cally active or outspoken? 

F: I go to all the Town Hall meet-
ings, and there you hear all the 
complaints about the people liv-
ing in the dorms, and just about 
what's wrong with the general ed 
of this school. I'm not just for the 
sophomore' class; I would also be 
for the entire Third college itself; 
it takes involvement. What I think 
is important, is just posters and 
flyers , I think that's what's the 
most important thing. 
Frost is a Third College senior 
majoring in mathematics 

RUBEN DURAN 
Third ophomore Senator 

G: What are the two mo t impor-
tant issues you feel next year' 
A.S. Council must address? 
Duran: One of the main thing for 
Thrid College is philosophy. A lot 
of what Third College is about is 
lost. It was originally meant for 
diversity, and to promote learn-
ing about other cultures, and 
brotherhood among people. I 
want to work on that. I'm on the 
20th Anniversary Committee, too. 
Parking at Third College for resi-
dents is really, really bad ... I've 
worked out some plans on that. 
As far as A.S.-wide,Ithink some-
thing that's really going to raise a 
lot of constroversy is the constitu-
tional convention. 
G: Do you think a convention is 
necessary? 
0: Yes. The way it stands right 
now we can do only three amend-
ments. 
G: If elected , how do you plan on 
keeping in touch with people in 
your college who are not politi-
cally active or outspoken? 
0: Right now we have the Town 
Meetings. What I want to do is et 
up an A.S.-Third College Council 
meeting, just to find out what 
[students] want, because we have 
office hours that are set up, and 
we're there and no one ever goes. 
Either that or just going out and 
asking each person ... walking 
around classes, you're hearing 
things. . 
Duran is a Third College fresh-
person and is undecided aboul his 
major. 

WARREN COLLEGE 

senior senator 
LISA FLAIG 
Warren Senior Senator 

Guardilln: What are the two most 
important issues' you feel next 
year's A.S. Council must address? 
Flaii: First of all, there's the night 
parking issue which J know a lot 
of people are up in arms over and 
a lo~ of people aren't quite under-
standing what's going to be hap-
pening with that. I think they 
need to let people know. 

Also, the parking situation here 
i terrible .. . I would push for 
more parking for students, less 
for the faculty. They need those 
spots, but they don't need as 
many as they have. They certainly 
don't use them. 

I would like to see [Warren] 
become less isolated from the rest 
of the campus. I want to have 
more things go on at the Price 
Center. We're lucky that's going

G: If elected, how do you plan on'

WARREN COLLEGE 

junior senator 
JEFFREY SHEAR 
Warren Junior Senator 

Guarditur: What are the two most 
important issues you feel next 
year's A.S. Council must address? 
Shear: I think the A.S. needs to 
become more cohesive and get 
together and take stands on dif-
ferent issues, such as the fee 
increase. 

When big issues come up, the 
A.S. should really get on it , write 
some kind of proposal up ... take 
some kind of a stand on that 
issue. 

Now that the Price Center is 
going to be finished this quarter, I 
think that next year more events 
can be planned for different 

colleges. 
G: If elected , how do you plan on 
keeping in touch with people in 
your college who are not politi-
cally active or out poken? 
S: I am also involved with [Warren 
apartment government]. Because 
of that , it's real easy for me to get 
to know what the students really 
want. Even though I'm running 
unopposed, I'm still going to go 
apartment to apartment just to let 
people know who I am. 

A survey asking the st udents 
what they like or what they need 
or how they'd like things to be at 
their college [could be used to 
solicit student opinions]. 

WARREN COLLEGE 

sophomore senator 
CRAIG SNEIDER MAN 
Warren Sophomore Senator 

GUIUditut: What are the two most 
important issues you feel next 
year's A.S. Council must address? 
Snelderman: I feel that one very 
important issue is basically just a 
social issue. 

Related to the TG referendum, 
but more than that. I feel the TGs 
are important. I'm not 21, but I 
still enjoy them. If people feel the 
need to drink, they can do it 
beforehand. 

I also heard that four or five 
years ago, Warren used to have . 
TGs at the Commons on off-
weeks that they didn't have TGs. I 
think it would be a great idea to 
reinstate that. I don't know how 
great it is that alcohol is present, 
but that's what draws people. 

A second issue is probably the 
nighttime parking because a lot of 
people don't really understand it 
because it came up kind of out of 
nowhere and there were petitions 
for it and everything. 

With the weekend events that 
are held here and the nighttime 
[restriced parking], it might be 
discouraging. I also don't think 
it's a very good idea for students 
to be parking off-campus .. . 
because there's more chances of 
vandalism to their car or if it's at 
night , someone walking alone, it's 
adding more chance. 
G: If elected, how do you plan on 
keeping in touch with people in 
your college who are not politi-
cally active or outspoken? 
S: People think of newsletters or 
they have office hours , I really 
don't feel that's effective because 
anyone that's really motivated 
enough with a problem is either 
going to take an office themselves 
or they'l seek you out. 

So I'm pretty active with all the 
programs that are held . .. and I 
think the best way would just be, 
when attending those, to talk to 
people I know and people that I 
don't know~

FIFTH COLLEGE 

sophomore senator 
LEON MESCHOULAM 
Fifth Sophomore Senator 

Guardilln: What are the two most 
important issues you feel next 
year's A.S. Council must address? 

I N 

Meschoulam: One is going to be 
the fees . A lot of people are trying 
to increase the fees, with the 
amphitheater fee and the athletic 
complex fee . So, I think fees is 
going to be a big issue, because 
we're the second highest. So, bas-
ically fees , I think, is going to hurt 
a lot of people 

The other one, which kind of 
ties into that , is the athletic com-
plex . I think it's something that 
UCSD has needed for about 10 
years now, but nobody has done 
anything about it until now. The 
problem is, there are no fund s. It 
will be hard for students to ap-
prove an increase in fees . We do 
need the athletic facilities, but we 
need to look at other ways of 
funding it. 
G: If elected, how do you plan on 
keeping in touch with people in 
your college who are not politi-
cally active or outspoken? 
M: I would like to try to get a 
newsletter out about once a 
month . I have an advantage 
because Fifth College is relatively 
small. I want to let people know 
when my office hours are, so if 
they have any problems or ques-
tions they can stop by and see 
what's happening. I would also 
like to work with the Fifth Col-
lege Council and have a little 
forum, where anyone can come. 
Meschoulam is a Fifth College 
sophomore majoring in econo-
mics. 
JOHN EDSON 
Fifth Sophomore Senator 

Guardilln: Next year, what do 
you think are the two most 
important issues that the A.S. is 
going to face? 
Edson: One would have to be the 
constitutional resolution as to 

T R o D u 

whether or not we should revise 
the entire constitution, because it 
is severely flawed . 
G: What's severly flawed about it? 
E: A lot of the things were made 
when there were only two col-
leges. For example, I can tell you, 
from being the Fifth College 
freshman senator, that there was 
not provision for incoming, new 
freshman senators. 
G: What's the second major issue 
you feel will confront the A.S. 
next year? 
E: The problem of internal dyna-
mics [of the A.S.]. Those have to 
be really changed. It's going to 
take strong leadership by whoever 
is the next A.S. president or vice-
president of internal affairs. 

More important than that is 
letting students know what A.S. 
does ; lett ing them know the 
importance of A.S., and letting 
the students' know that they can 
come to us with mailers that con-
cern them. 

It's up to the senators to find 
things that are wrong in their own 
colleges and take those [to the 
A.S.]. " 
G: Is it important to keep in con-
tact with the people in your col-
lege who are not politically out-
spoken who are not on the College 
Council? 
E: I would say that many of the 
people who don't voice concern 
have an apathetic view. The really 
motivated students, the ones who 
want to make a difference, are the 
ones who approach the Council. 

What can be done is [sending 
out questioners with the ques-
tion,] "What concerns you most 
about the college and about the 
school?"

son double majoring in political

When the greac scorer 
comes, co mark againsl your 
name, he wrices nOI chat you 
won or 10SI, bue how you 
played the game. 

- Grantland Rice 

We can certainly thank 
myth makers like Grantland 
Rice and Ford Frick for this 
equation: man who plays 
baseball=hero. Sportswriters 
have passed on the myth from 
Ruth to DiMaggio to Mu ial 
to Mantle to Banks to Gar-
vey to Carter. 

Over the years athlete 
became role models - to be 
fair, a burden many didn't 
eek of particularly relish . 

One of the most ludicrous 
myth was the image of Babe 
Ruth as a lovable lug who hit 
home run for sick little boys 
in ho pitals . Ruth did make a 
few sick calls, but he spent 
most of his time chasing 
whore and boozing. In the 
arena of consumption, he was 
the real "refrigerator." 

Legend has it that on a 
train ride to Bo ton , in view 
of a contingent of writers 
coveting the Yankees that 
included future commissioner 
Ford Frick , Ruth chased one 
of his tramps down the center 
aisle, both of them buck nek-
kid . The writers looked at 
each other with knowing 
winks and nudges - there 
was one incident that would 
never ee newsprint. 

These are the men that 
preserved in print the legacy 
of the game. 

How the hero / ballplayer 
merger came about is unclear 
... or why. At the turn of the 
century, the image of a ball-
player was rather seedy. It 
was that of a street wise 
brawler, Runyonesque, dis-
tinctly lowbrow. A boozy 
vulgarian with the same social 
st.anding as a carney act. A 
low paid thug with a nick-
name like U Alibi Ike." 

Not exactly the stuff of 
popular fiction for young 
boys. 
_ In the '20s and '30s base-
ball's popularity grew - it 
became the first professional 
team sport with a nationwide 
fo llowing. As its popularity 
grew, America's youth got 
caught up in the game and 
were interested in the lives of 
its ballplayers. Baseball play-
ers, who after all were enter-
tainers enjoyed the popular-
ity of movie stars . The game 
itself became like U.S. Steel 
- and those whose living 
was the game decided that 
the company line was the best 
policy. 

The myth persevered for 
many decades, despite the 
efforts of such visionaries as 
Battlin' Billy Martin in the 
'50s to strike a blow (pun 
intended) for rebellious indi-
vidualism and a reflection of 
socie ty's problems. We 've

Men's Water Polo Breaks Guinness Record 
By BRIAN ITOW 
Contributing SportS Edilor 

At 1: 15 Saturday afternoon, 14 
Tritons tepped in to the UCSD 
Natatorium pool to attempt the 
longest water polo match of all 
time. 26 hours later, the exhausted 
players emerged with a new Guin-

ne s Record. 
The record was set by players 

from the Triton water polo team 
who were divided into two teams 
that amassed 948 goals during the 
time span. Larry Sanders, J .P. 
Beay, Peter Me Conville, Stuart 
Sweeny, Chris Carrillo, Mike 
Schatz, and Jay Hagen (who was 
a late replacement for Todd Brin-

ton) comprised one team while 
Turtle Brown, Todd Sells, Randy 
Franke, Tom Schatz, Jason 
Vance, Greg Goodrich and John 
Sklut made up the other. 

The Tritons' 26 hour perfor-
mance broke an old record of 25 
hours, 36 minutes, et three years 
ago by a boys team at Shrewsbury 
School in Schropshire, England. 

The Tritons entered the pool 
prepared for their assault on the 
record. " I wouldn't say it was con- , 
fidence ," Todd Sells said. ' ''We 
ju t knew we wouldn't stop until 
we got the record ." 

Playi ng seve n a ide without 
substitutions, the players began 
o waver in at about the fifteenth 

hour. At about 2:30 a .m., with 
neither a crowd nor sunshine in 
sight , three players became fa-
tigued by bad ca es of acid indi-
gestion while others grew weary 
and bored . 

"When I saw the sun ... it was 
over," Chris Carrillo said. "We'd 
made it. From that point on, we 
knew we wouldn't stop." 

Approximately eight hours and 
20 minutes later, the record was 
theirs. 

"It's an incredible accomplish-
ment," Head Coach Denny Har-
per said . "There was no doubt in 
my mind that we'd do it ... and we 
really had no major problems 
other than general fatigue and 
boredom." 

Still , the players were relieved 
when it ended. "I didn't think it'd 
be too much of a problem, but the 
more I thought about it, the more 
scared I got," Vance said . "There 
wa a point in the middle of the 
night when it began looking im-
possible, but we did it and I'm 
really glad it's over. Now I just 
want to stay dry for a long time."

Weary, but not beaten: UCSD poses for a post game shot. 

"Early in the morning, it looked 
like a few of us wouldn't make it ," 
Tom Schatz said. " It seemed like 
we'd never ee daylight . But when 
we saw the sun, it was a big relief 
- it was like a light at the end of 
the tunnel." 

Vance and the rest of the Trit-
ons just might get the chance. 
"We won't be trying to break our 
record in the next few month ," 
Harper said . "[ think that 11 be it 
for a while. " 

Baseball Sweeps Doubleheader; Regional Chances Improve Greatly 

Tritons Sock it to Cal St. San Bernardino 
By PHIL GRUEN 
Spons Editor 

The UCSD baseball team's 1989 
doubleheader blues may finally 
be over. After splitting their first 
six twin bills of the year, the Trit-
ons have rebounded to sweep two 
for thei r last three - including an 
impressive and crucial one over 
the rival Cal State San Bernar-
dino Coyotes 10-5 and 6-4 Satur-
day afternoon at Olsen Field . 

Perhaps more significantly, the 
Tritons (17-12), battling with San 
Bernardino (18-8) for a regional 
spot, improved' their chances of 
selection by vi rtue of a 3- I record 
in head-to-head competition this 
year. With Triton Head Coach 
Lyle Yates on the Regional selec-
tion committee, the chances are 
even better. Still , the Tritons have 
II scheduled games left and Yates 
is going to take it one game at a 
time. 

"We've got to go out there 
every time and play with the kind 
of intensity we showed today," he 
said . "We played aggressive ball 
in every inning. We took each 
inning today as if it was a separate 
game ... everybody was up for 
this game." 

The Triton offense left little 
doubt about that. In the first 

Michael. oulks/ Guardian 
Junior J.J . Fisher struck out 11 
batters in the first game 

game, UCSD scored in every 
inning and collected 10 hits to 
overcome a brief 3-1 deficit and 
cruise to a 10-5 victory. Junior 
J .J . Fisher went all the way for 
UCSD, striking out II to pick up 
the victory. 

After taking a 2-1 lead into the 
third inning, Fisher ran into a lit-
tle trouble when Matt Bynum's 
error at shortstop opened the 
door for Paul Gonzalez, who 
smacked a three-run homer to 
give the Coyotes a 4-2 lead . 

Fisher, however, said that he 
was "never worried," and as the 
Tritons scored eight runs in the 
remaining four innings, he had no 
reason to be . 

UCS D tied the game in a hurry 
- benifitting primarily from the 
defensive woes of Coyote catcher 
Brian Cooper. Before Cooper was 
taken aut in the fourth inning for 
a defensive replacement, he had 
allowed four stolen bases and live 
passed balls. One of the stolen 
bases was Chris Murphy's steal of 
home which knotted the game at 
four in the bottom of the third. 

Mkbael Foulks/ Guardia" 
Sophomore transfer Anthony Sanchez files in with a run. 

After Coyote pitcher Gary 
Irwin kicked into his customary 
slow windup, Murphy charged 
down the line and slid head into 
first home plate with the tying run 
just as the ball was arriving. 

" 1 had a great jump," Murphy 
pointed out. " But I wouldn't have 
stolen it if their pitcher wasn't so 
slow. I knew I had it." 

Fisher appeared to be getting 
stronger as the game progressed , 

holding the Coyotes to only one 
run and three hits over the final 
four innings. The UCSD offense 
also muscled up in the final 
innings, particularly the last two, 
as home runs by Gary Fessia and 
Murphy and doubles by Anthony 
Sanchez and Jim Martinez gave 
the Tritons five runs in both the 
fifth and the sixth to seal the 
victory. 

But in order to keep their 
playoff hopes alive, the Tritons 
knew they had to put forth an 
equally impressive effort in the 
second game. Their enthusiasm, 
however, was not renected on the 
offensive end in the first three 
innings as they held on to a I-I tie 
despite the benefit of a base hit. 

But in the fourth inning, the 

Tritons bats came alive when three 
singles by Murphy, Dave Now-
lan, and Bynum, and a · walk to 
Martinez, all contributed to a 
three-run rally which gave UCSD 
a lead they never relinquished . 

l.eftfielder Henry Jiminez spark-
ed UCSD in the final innings both 
at the plate and in the field by 
collecting two hits - including a 
home run - and by making a 
spectacular diving grab of a foul 
ball in the Coyote bullpen. 

After the Triton bats had pro-
vided a four-run cushion, starter 
and eventual winner Mike Mor-
gan took control of the game by 
shutting down San Bernardino 
on three hits from the fourth

national coverage) for about a 
decade now that our professional 
athletes are human beings - not 
cha racters out of a Clair Bee 
novel. This has been a decad e of 
drug rehab and trials, bad press 
relations, strikes , violent on- and 
off-field brawls, collusion, and 
ungraceful falls by great stars of 
the past. 

In light of these standards, this 
spring's scintillating trifecta is not 
shocking in the least, but perfectly 
logical. The well-documented ad-
ventures of Wade Boggs (scorned 
mistress), Steve Garvey (children 
out of wedlock and broken en-
gagements), and Pete Rose (gam-
bling) are mind -boggling none-
theless. These stories are spec-
tacular because of the magnitude 
of their talents and reputations. 
The mere drug falls of Pascual 
Perez and Floyd Youmans are 
old hat indeed. 

Boggs, Garvey and Rose - all 
seemed to relish the image of role 
model. Try to think ofthree play-
ers that more epitomized the image 
of baseball. Wade, the hitting 
machine with his titles and array 
of good-copy superstitions, play-
ing in that lyrical bandbox / 
shrine, Fenway Park; Steve, the 
all-American boy, marathon auto-
grapher and future senator, whose 
1984 playoff homer still recalls 
chills in San Diegans; and Pete, 
the dusty-faced legend, ballplay-
er's ballplayer, Charlie Hustle 
(sorry), the game's all-time hits 
leader. . 

The common denominator here 
is arrogance - a trait that's not 
inbred, but acquired after years of 

special treatment. These incidents 
might be mere titillation if not for 
Boggs' sanctimonious rationaliz-
ing, Garvey's smug Eddie Haskell 
position, and Rose 's bold lying. 

In Boggs' defense, Margo 
Adams does conduct herself like a 
whore and capitalis t, and as her 
shoplifting charge shows, he's 
none too stable. But the mental 
picture of Wade jumping up from 
the couch during "Geraldo ," 
slapping his forehead with a sense 
of relief and self-realization and 
crying "Addiction to sex, yeah! 
That's the ticket," is laughable. 
He also seem to relish his appear-
ance with another of his icons, 
Barbara Walters. He managed 
some convincing tears as he 
reflected on how lucky he ' was 
that his wife Debbie didn't send 

/him packing when word of his 
indiscretions were to become 
public record. Does anybody think 
he would have confessed if Margo 
had just clammed up and offered 
to go off to Nordstrom's - never 
to be heard from again? 

The expression on Steve Gar-
vey's face as Marty Levin of 
Channel 39 interviewed him about 
his off-the-field interests was a 
familiar one. It was identical to 
the one he used in countless inter-
views ove~ the years as he ex-
plained how he hit that homerun, 
or won that MVP award, or might 
run for the Senate someday, or 
would like to run the Padres. He 
was juggling more dates than Tony 
Curtis in "Boeing, Boeing," yet he 
failed to pick up one of the 
~Responsibilities in Birth Control " 
pamphlets anyone can find in the 
back of the church. His term for 
the handling of his problems was 
"damage control." If this scandal

Lynn Moreno pitched the 

Tritons to a 5-0 victory in the 
second game of Saturday's 
doubleheader as UCSD split 
with La Verne on the road . 

Stacie Sasaki was charged 
with a loss in the opener as the 
Tritons fell, 2- I. 

In the second game, the 
Tritons (22-7) were led offen-
sively by Kathy Fogg, Dianna 
Moreno, and Pam Harnack, 
who each collected two hits. 

UCSD is currently ranked 
second in the West and fourth 
in the country. 

Men's Tennis 
The Tritons won all three 

doubles matches, breaking a 3-
3 tie and giving them a 6-3 vic-

\ tory over Division I Loyola 
Marymount. 

The Tritons, ranked fourth 
nationally in Division Ill, is a 
good bet to make the 10-team 
National Tournament. Their 
onty loss came against UC 
Santa Cruz, ranked second. 

Women's Tennis 
Despite pounding the ma-

jority of their Division III 
competition this year, the Tri-
tons continue to have trouble 
with Pomona-Pitzer. Saturday, 
the Tritons fell to the Division 
III Sagehens for the second 
time this year, as losses at the 
number o ne and two doubles 

spots for the Tritons gave 
Pomona-Pitzer the 5-4 victory. 

Yesterday, the Tritons re-
bounded to thrash Claremont-
Mudd 8-1 , a team that had 
lost 5-4 to Pomona-Pitzer in a 
previous match. 

Last Monday, despite Chris-
tine Behrens'top-seeded defeat 
at the hands of nationally top-
ranked Carolyn Bodart 6-2, 6-
4, the Tritons trounced Menlo 
College 8- I. 

UCSD is 11-4 and is ranked 
second on the West Coast. 

Crew 
The UCSDmen'sand wom-

en's crew teams found no relief 
from the heat Saturday as 
Loyola Marymount University 
burned the Tritons, winning 
six out of nine races. 

The Triton women went 
two-for-five on the day, with 
both victories comi ng from the 
novice boats. Varsity heavy-
weights finished seven seconds 
behind Loyola with a time of 
7:23.2, while the varsity light-
weights came up short, cross-
ing at 7: 12.7. 

The men's team had an even 
tougher oilting. The varsity 
heavyweight boat made con-
tact with the Loyola boat 500 
meters into the race, but re-
grouped and beat Loyola to 
the finish with a time of 5:45. 
Loyola, however, protested the 
race and was successful, strip-
ping the Tritons of the victory. 

Loyola continued to punish 
UCSD, sinking the varsity 
lightweight and the novice A 
boats. 

The single win for the men's

knew he'd be a winner when he claimed that one of his 
particular goals as president was to " ... get with the 
administration ... and start expressing alternative 
ideas: Like the football team" (Guardian, April II , 
1988). With the plans already down for the new 
billion-dollar football complex and the top high 
school players from all over the state knocking down 
doors to come here, Dimmesdale has done it all .

anything else, Phil recommends that you . . .

Hell, Pete Rose is right. He is r----------------------------
