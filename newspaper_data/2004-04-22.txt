uc turns away 
eligible applicants 
UCSD admits low rate of 

underrepresented minorities 
By VLADIMIR KOGAN 

Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD admitted 17,151 stu-
dents for fall 2004, down 2.4 per-
cent from 2003. The University of 
California overall admitted 6.7 per-
cent less students than last yeu. 

The eight undergraduate UC 
campuses turned away 7,600 UC-
eligible students. It is the first time in 
over 40 years the university has 
denied admission to eligible fresh-
men. More than 3,700 other appli-
cants received offers for spots in the 
winter and spring of 2005, or a refer-
ral to an engineering program at UC 
Riverside, according to data released 
by the university. 

"We don't like turning away 
students," UC Director of 
Undergraduate Admissions Susan 
Wilbur said at an April 20 telecon-
ference. "It's been a very difficult 
year for students. It's been a diffi-
cult year for the university." 

The system offered admission 
to 73 percent of aU applicants. UC 
Santa Cruz experienced the largest 
cha.nge compared to last year, 
faUmg by nearly 14 percent, with 
just over 67 percent of applicants 
for the fall receiving an offer of 

admission. 
UCSD accepted fewer than four 

out of every 10 high school seniors 
who applied for faJl admission, in 
addition to 775 students admitted 
for winter 2005. 

Admitted students had higher 
marks and test scores than last year. 
The average grade point average 
rose to 4.05 from 4.04 and average 
SAT I scores increased by 12 points 
to 1,300. 

The number of underrepresent-
ed minorities offered admission to 
UCSD fell by 4.9 percent. 

Though the number of under-
represented minority students as a 
proportion of aU admits rose for 
the UC system, the number at 
UCSD feU, down to 14.4 percent 
of all admits. It is a 4.9 percent 
drop for the campus in admission 
offers to underrepresented minori-
ties compared to last year's statis-
tics. 

The . campus 'lags behind the 
systemwide of admissions to under-
represented minority students rate 
by more than 5 percent.

Groups protest anitnal testing 
Activists target vivisection at UCSD labs 

ByUSAMAK 
Senior Staff Writer 

As part of the annual World 
Week for Animals in Laboratories 
campaign, activists from UCSD 
Students Against Animal Suffering 
and San Diego Animal Advocates 
protested on April 20 against ani-
mal testing conducted at UCSD. 

Protesters stood at the intersec-
tion of La Jolla Village Drive and 
Villa La Jolla Drive, passing out 
information and holding signs with 
messages such as "Unseen Cruelty, 
Suffering and Death" and 
"Vivisection: Science Gone Mad." 

"We learned of the cruel and 
wasteful experiments going on at 
UCSD and decided to have a 
protest in conjunction with World 
Week for Animals in 
Laboratories," JiU Fritz, president 
of San Diego Animal Advocates, 
said. 

Due to pressure from protest-
ers, the UCSD School of Medicine 
decided in August 2003 to drop a 
course requirement in which stu-
dents watched experiments and 
demonstrations on live dogs. 

According to Fritz, however, 
approximately 467 animal experi-
ments are currently talcing place at 
UCSD. 

The protesters said the school 
still uses primates, rodents and Billy Worf/Guordion

UCSD students participated in 
activities for Day of Silence on 
April 21 by wearing black and 
keeping silent throughout the day 
to protest discrimination against 
the lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans-
gender community. Sponsored by 
the Lesbian Gay Bisexual 
Transgender Queer Intersex 
Alliance and in its third year at 
UCSD, Day of Silence was held to 
raise awareness to issues affecting 
the community. 

The event is part of a series of 
events for Hate Free Campus 
Week, sponsored by the Student 
Office of Human Relations and 
participating organizations. 

Participants in the Day of 
Silence handed out "speaking 
cards," which stated reasons for the 
protest and asked for support. 

Organizers of Day of Silence 
said that the "silence" pertains to 
the way many people in the 
LGBTQI community are not given 
the opportunity to speak out about 
issues concerning them. 

"Our objective is mainty for 
LGBTQI awareness and the issues 

involved in the community as far as 
the 'silencing,' and also to visibly 
show support for the community," 
said Brian IIagan, a member of the 
Day of Silence Organizing 
Committee. "When we say 'silent' 
we're talking about the discrimina-
tion, harassment and abuse people 
face." 

The day consisted of events 
including a silent lunch at Price 
Center Plaza. Papers and pens were 
available for participants to write 
notes to each other. A board dis-
playing personal messages was also 
set up in the plaza. Some students 
also took the time to decorate tiles 
with messages opposing discrimi-
nation. 

According to Gillian Soonad, 
who was also part of the commit-
tee, the event encouraged everyone 
to participate regardless of gender 
orientation. 

..... On the UCSD campus 
specificaUy and in the community, 
there are very few visible places to 
support the community," Sonnad 
said. "It's an encompassing event 
and one of the only ones that is 
very visible. to

Former student suspected 
of string of bank robberies 

UCSD graduate Steven Kang was arrested as 
a suspect In a series of bank rObberies on April 
17, according to San Diego police. 

The 25-year-old economics major was 
arrested after a bank teller at the San Diego 
National Bank in Clairemont recognized Kang 
from wanted posters. 

Police notices described the suspect in a 
string of five San Diego-area holdups as the 
"Meal lime Bandit" for the times at which he 
allegedly robbed banks, according to reports. 

Kang is suspected of robbing two Mira Mesa 
banks on March 31 . In both cases, the suspect 
was described as wearing sun~asses and a visor 
and seen driving ~ay in a black Lexus, accord-
ing to police. Kang was arrested on April 17 after 
leaving the Clairemont bank in a black Lexus. 

Kang had previously been arrested on April 
2 in Las Vegas after a bank employee saw him 
holding a demand note as he stood in line 
police said. 'He pleaded guilty to a Nevada stat~ 
charge, according to police, but was sentenced 
to probation as a first-time offender. 

UCAB says student o~ may 
have to share new offices 
In light of the advancing Price Center and 

Student Center expansion, the allocation of 
office spaces for various student organizations 
was discussed at the University Centers 
Advisory Board meeting on April 19. 

The expansion plan called for 84 new office 
spaces for student organizations, including 
Student Affirmative Action Committee, Greek 
organizations,and SRlY, among others. 

Due to the limited amount of new space in 
the expansion plan, UCAB officials are in dis-
cussion with various student organizations that 
may have to double or triple up to share the 
new office spaces, according to UCAB Chair 
Justin Williams. The 84 spaces in the plan fea-
ture single-space offices approximately 80 
square feet and double offices of approximate-
ly 120 square feet 

However, the general plannin8 of the 
expansion space itself remains tentative. 

Organizations in SAAC requested substan-
tial storage space be made available in the 
new offices for storing equipment and supplies 
for eNents, rallies and protests, according to 
SAAC officials. In response to this request, 
UCAB is considering adding locker spaces to 
the expansion plan.

Bookstore asks GetTexbooks.com to 
remove clip art from advertisements 

By VLADlMII KOGAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

University officials have asked 
the creator of a student-run Web 
site to immediately stop distribut-
ing his advertising materials, 
which they say use a UCSD 
Bookstore trademark in violation 
of state law. 

In a letter sent to Earl Warren 
College senior Jeremy Jung, 
Campus Counsel Ann Parode 
stated that the clip-art image of an 
anthropomorphic book improper-
ly implied an association between 
his GnTtxthoolu.tI1m Internet page 
and UCSD Bookstore. 

"Even if we're not a commer-
cial institution, we still take our 
trademarlcs very seriously," Julie 
Conner, the associate campus 
counsel said. "Jeremy is by no 
means being singled out." 

Jung, whose Web site provides 
free comparisons of book prices 
from SO online retailers, said he 
was careful to make his service 
without using any protected 
designs. 

"When I first created the site, I 
had read about some of the other 
sites using UCSD in the name. I 
made sure not to do that," Jung 
said. 

J ung said he was not familiar 
with UCSD Bookstore symbol 
when he got his own clip-art from 
a Web-based clip-art vendor 
Jupitermedia, through a paid sub-
scription. 

Under his license agreement 
with the vendor,Jung may use the 
images he purchased "as part of 
marketing, advertising or promo-
tional materials, including print 
ads, mailers, handouts and pack-
aging." 

"Our concern was that because

ArtwoIt: UCSD Bookstore claims that the cip.art image (left) used on Warren 
College senior Jeremy Jung's web site, GetTextbooks.com, violates state laws. 
the logo was so similar, and the 
logo was representing the Web 
site, there would be confusion in 
the marketplace because people 
would think that the Web site was 
a service that the bookstore was 
offering," John T~k, director of 
UCSD Bookstore said. 

Turk said he contacted the 
campus counsel after seeing an 
emblem very similar to the one 
used by UCSD Bookstore on the 
back of Jung's vehicle. 

University officials said UCSD 
Bookstore developed its logo six 
years ago, but it is not registered 
with the U.S. Patent and 
Trademark Office or the listing 
maintained by the California 
Secretary of State's office. Very 
few UC campuses go through the 
"extensive process" necessary to 
acquire registration, Conner said. 

However, according to the fed-
eral U .S. Code, trademarks do not 
need to be officially registered to 
receive legal protection. Under 
the statutes, a business cannot use 
a symbol to market its products if 
it is so similar to another that it 
may potentially confuse con-

sumers. The protection applies 
only if both businesses in question 
provide analogous products and 
services, Conner said. 

While Jung legally purchased 
the right to print the symbol in his 
promotions, Conner said his use 
of it to market a service like the 
one provided by UCSD 
Boolcstore meets the "confusingly 
similar" threshold of the law. 

"I think they are (confusingly 
similar), but it's subject to opin-
ion," Conner said. "That's what a 
judge would decide." 

The university has no objec-
tions to the clip-art service, which 
owns the actual image, because it 
does not offer any services stu-
dents can find at UCSD 
Bookstore, Conner said. 

Mary Ann Boland, a 
spokesman for Jupitermedia, 
which owns the clip-art service, 
did not respond to requests for 
comment. 

Jung said he has not yet decid-
ed if he will comply with the uni-
versity'S request, which would

DJs file complaint over 
all-campus dance 

By MARNmE FEDEIIS 
Associate News Editor 

The DJs and Vinyphiles Club 
recently filed a complaint to the 
Judicial Board after it was removed 
from the all-campus spring dance 
program. The dance, held April 2, 
was originally planned to feature 
two dance floors located at the 
Price Center Plaza and Ballrooms 
A and B. Due to a chance of rain, 
organizers decided to create only 
the one dance floor at the ballroom 
location. This caused the deejays 
from DVC, some of whom were 
UCSD alumni and had traveled 
from Los Angeles, to be turned 
away. 

According to DVC Vice 
President Victor Chiu, the club had 
a verbal agreement with event 
organizer Sixth College 
Sophomore Senator Michael 
Dawson that five of its deejays 
would play music at the ballroom 
location in exchange for promo-
tions through flyers and other 
forms of advertising. However, 
according to Chiu, the advertise-
ments containing its club logo were 
minimal. 

"We had agreed that we would 
have our promotions," Chiu said. 
"We had asked that our name and 
logo be placed in the large PC ban-
ner, but there wasn't any suggestion 
of our name at all. It was slightly 
disappointing. " 

According to Dawson, who 
organized the all-campus dance, 
logos of the nine sponsors of the 
event were all the same size on the 
rave cards handed out. 

"The whole case is ludicrous 
and there is no validity in their 
claim," Dawson said. 

Dawson also said that there was 

no formal can tract or other agree-
ment in regards to other forms of 
advertising. 

"The verbal agreement was that 
the DVC would be mentioned on 
all of the rave cards, flyers and 
advertising that I had control of," 
Dawson said." 

Dawson added that all of the 
sponsors were given the same type 
of advertisement. 

"We had put their logo in all the 
ad cards and even A.S., who had 
given over 52,SOO, had the same 
size logo," Dawson said. "[DVC 
was) equally represented with all 
other sponsors." 

Pan of the complaint stem from 
Chiu's lack of notice to club mem-
bers that their services would no 
longer be needed for t~e dance. 

"When it came down to it, to 
the actual party, [Dawson] didn't 
really talk to me," Chiu said. "He 
left us out in the darle." 

Chiu said that DVC was sup-
posed to receive a call by 3:30 p.m. 
on April 2 about the possibility of 
rain changing the set-up of the 
dance. According to Chiu, an alter-
native would have been to separate 
the ballrooms so that DVC still 
would have been able to deejay. 

"The interesting part of this is 
that tech services and PC opera-
tions were all for having two small-
er ballrooms, but [the organizers] 
were still more willing to have only 
one dance floor," Chiu said. 

However, Dawson said splitting 
the ballroom into two dance floors 
would have forced organizers to 
turn students away because of the 
maximum capacity limits of the 
rooms. 

"I thought that option was not

from discrimination based 
on sexual orientation or

The 1999 law mandated that 
the l,OOO-plus districts in 
California update their dis-
crimination policies to 
include language protecting 
students wllo identify with a 
gender that may be contrary 
to others' perceptions. 

The wee board mem-
bers in favor of excluding the 
state's language from the dis-
trict poUcy said discrimina-
tion should not be based on 
tJ:te perc.eption ?f tJ:te ~lleS'ed 
V1com m a dlscnmmaoon 
case, but rather that of the 
accused. The majority 
argued that the 1999 defini-
tion would make it harder to 
discipUne boys sneaking into 
the girls' restroom if the boy 
claimed he identified as a 
female. 

While it is logical that the 
right to claim a gender iden-
tity could potentially be 
abused in a K-12 school 
environment, the board's 
decision is shortsighted and 
simple-minded. If real 
harassment waS exhibited 
toward a transgender stu-
dent, would the perpetrator 

be given the final say as to 
his motivations? Would dis-
crimination against students 
become completely obsolete 
in future records because 
none of the alleged perpe-
trators C.lme clean to admin-
istrators about their motiva-
tions? 

Gender issues are becom-
ing increasingly' significant 
in schools. The Cdjfornia 
Department of Education 
and California Safe School 
Coalition both said they rec-
ognize that discrimination 
based on gender identity is 
an urgent problem, and that 
the state law is a positive 
response to a difficulty many 
K-12 students face. 

Superintendent of Public 
Instruction Jack O'Connell's 
decision to not withhold 
state funding from the dis-
trict was correct in that it 
would only hurt 
Westminster's students and 
teachers, and doesn't punish 
the noncompliant board 
members. However, the 
Westminster School District 
must follow the law and 
adopt a better nondiscrimi-
natory policy - as well as 
develop a more concrete 
stateWIde policy to clear 
confusion - that serves the 
intended purpose of protect-
ing all of California's K-12 
students, not just those with 
traditional gender identities. 

Students statewide 
protest budget c·uts 

W orking with con-cerned citizens and 
educators, students 

at the University of 
California, California State 
University and state com-
munity colleges have 
formed a coalition to protest 
proposed budget cuts. 
Building such a lars-e, 
diverse framework for jOlOt 
action is admirable and like-
ly the most effective w~y to 
address an issue that affects 
all public university students 
statewide. 

Locally, UCSD, San 
Diego State, CSU San 
Marcos, Southwestern 
College, and City, Mesa and 
Miramar Colleges are par-
ticipating in die campaign 
to stop the budget cuts. 

The statewide week of 
action, which began April 14, 
gives colleges across 
California a chance to unite 
in protest against Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger's 
budget proposals and initiate 
unified action. 

CaUfornia college students 
met April 3 to establish a set 
of demands, and a statewide 
day of action is planned to 
occur on April 26. Students 
will present a set of five 
demands to the governor and 
local representatives and par-
ticipate in classroom walk-
outs and marches. 

The unity and or~niza­
tion of this statewide effon is 
commendable. It is an actual 
call of united action for a 
common goal.

., I LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Share files and suffer 

the consequences 
Editor: . 

After much deliberation about 
my current legal situation with 
UCSD Student Policies and 
Judicial Affairs, I feel that it is 
important for me to inform the 
student body of a situation that 
has been substantially unique to 
me. At the end of fall quarter in 
2003, I onc day went to turn on 
my computer. I immediately 
noticed that my Internet was not 
working. Not disturbed by this 
highly regular occurrence with 
my computer, I began to attempt 
different troubleshooting meth-
ods for my Internet service. Soon 
I realized that something was very 
wrong. I contacted Academic 
Computing Services and they 
informed me that my computer 
Internet connection had been 
suspended because of multiple 
computer violations. Alarmed, I 
immediately set up a meeting 
with an ACS manager, Chuck, 
who told me that I was guilty of 
61e-sharing. 

Truthfully, when all of this 
happened, I was in a bit of disbe-
lief. I didn't understand what file-
sharing was and the consequences 
of it today. Sure, I had heard 
many different cases of it on the 
web, but I didn't think it was that 
big of a deal. I never thought it 
could happened to me. But I was 
extremely wrong. 

When I first got to college, the 
first thing I did with my comput-
er was download Kazaa. I was 
thrilled at the fact that I could 
download songs and movies for 
free off the Internet at very high 
speeds. But I never gave any con-
sideration to what I was doing. I 
didn't think that maybe, by me 
stealing songs off the Internet, I 
could be causing harm upon the 
music industry. I didn't think that 
by sharing files with others that I 
could be convicted of a crime as 
well. Here at UCSD though, 
ACS protects students from any 
federal legal action that could be 
taken upon them. Student 
Internet activities are monitored 

well and this is precisely how I 
got into trouble. ACS sent me a 
warning at the end of October 
about my failure to comply with 
ACS rules about 61e-sharing. I 
have to embarrassingly say that I 
joked about the warning, but nev-
ertheless disabled file sharing on 
Kazaa. I bought a new computer 
shortly after and again installed • 
Kazaa, but this time, forgot to' 
disable file-sharing. This mistake 
has gonen me into trouble over 
the last few months. At the end of 
November, I didn't have Internet 
service for 2 weeks, and I was 
referred to Student Policies and 
] udicial Affairs. 

I had to meet with the dean of 
my college and discuss my situa-
tion. After discussing different 
possibilities for me to redeem 
myself and find good faith with 
ACS as well as the Student 
Policies and Judicial Affairs 
office, we came up with a plan for 
me to teach other UCSD stu-
dents not to make the same mis-
talc.e that I did. File-sharing is 
wrong, and against UCSD policy. 
Regardless of the argument exist-
ing that says file-sharing is OK, it 
is simply not worth it for your 
Internet connection to be dis-
abled and for you to have to deal 
with Student Policies and] udicial 
Affaits. 

Today, I have disabled Kazaa.1

Marianne Madden 

I recently found myself at a party mostly attended by structural engineering 
majors. 

I took a deep breath as I 
pulled open the door and 
entered the house. The engi-
neers, even outside their natural 
habitat, looked normal enough. 
They walked, danced, and other-
wise moved in a typical manner. 
Nothing was alarming about 
their speech patterns. Thus com-
forted, I fetched myself a drink 
(Kool-Aid, of course) and posi-
tioned myself on the periphery 
of the room. Before long I was 
approached by a male party-goer 
who, after we shouted greetings, 
inquired about my major. 

Now, we are all told a lot of 
things about UCSD before we 
come here. Most of what we're 
told, of course, is untrue. But 
what prospective freshmen aren't 
told is the one crucial piece of 
wisdom they need: If you are a 
non-science major, expect to be 
treated like a leper during the 
duration of your UCSD career. 
It doesn't matter if you're work-
ing six jobs, simply passing time 
until you inherit your father's 

multimillion-dollar snack cake out from nowhere and dragged 
empire, or you're tired of toiling my struggling form out of the 
in the lab after winning your party. "I may pursue a lesser sub-
third Nobel Prize: As long as ject at a science-and-engineering 
you are at UCSD, no one will school, but 1 have many fascinat-
take you seriously as loog as you ing hobbies! I'm witty, and I 
persist in studying any subject promise not to drink all your 
judged inferior (that is, easier Kool-Aid! And at the very least, 
and less lucrative) to math, sci- I'll smile and nod as you discuss 
ence or engineering. your interests!" 

I confess, 1 am 
one of these non-
science majors in 
question (my 
actual major will 
not be named 
here, because 
dirty words 
shouldn't be 
printed in news-
papers). So when 
the friendly engi-
neer asked me my 
major, I should 
have bolted from 
the party ~ or, 
better yet, lied. 
But the Kool-Aid 
was flowing, and 
I was caught off 
guard. 

Instead of 
keeping my wits

But alas, I'd 
fallen from the 
graces of my 
would-be com-
panions. Cast out 
from the party 
with nothing but 
my Kool-Aid, the 
shredded remains 
of my dignity, 
and the clothes 
on my back, I set 
out for my woe-

ic home. 

OK, so the 
part about the

ing me out of the 
party was fiction-
al, but the moral 

about me, I let the engineer in 
on my deepest, darkest secret. I 
told him my major, and within 
half a second, the music abruptly 
stopped, the lights came on, and 
everyone froze, their mouths 

of the story 
remains: Non-scientistS, be 
ashamed. Be very ashamed. But 
be prepared, also. Use your cre-
ativity to your advantage, and 
gracefully construct accepuble 
responses to "What's your 
major?" A quick sampling of 
potential answers include the 
following:

Keeping these strategies in

Me (nonchalantly lying

ME: "Sure. But be careful,

Accordingly, biobehavioral treatment provides patients with a scientific 
perspective from which to examine behavior, feelings, thoughts, and physiology. 
It encourages patients to focus upon what they can do, not upon how they 
feel. Feelings don't change feelings; behavior changes feelings. People can 
relieve anxiety or fear best by changing their associated, maladaptive behaviors. 

Biobehavioral treatment helps the patient to understand and relieve anxiety 
or fear and to achieve a state of well-being. LifeMAX® offers treatment via 
a computer-assisted format; including multimedia, educational presentations 
and interactive guides designed to enrich the doctor-patient interaction. 
Learning is a cornerstone of treatment. Early in treatment, doctor and 
patient together define the problem specifically and objectively then target 
goals. Next, they design a treatment plan. Finally, under professional 
guidance, the patient measures behavioral and emotional progress.

Lowering voting age threatens u.s. political system 
Passing bill to give 14 .. year .. olds the right to vote is not the way to 

inspire interest in politics and current events among America's youth 
ByIWROZGA 

Staff Writer 

When a bill was recently intro-
duced in the California Legislature 
ro lower the minimum voting age to 
14, the response was weariness rem-
iniscent of someone unsure of being 
duped on April Fools Day. One per-
plexed legislator succinctly but 
appropriately summarized it as "the 
nuttiest idea I've ever heard." 

However, the author of SB 1606, 
State Sen. John Vasconcellos (D-San 
Jose), is very serious. And despite 
certain aspects of SB 1606 that make 
it unlikely to ever pass in the 
Legislature, not to mention down-
right silly (such as allowing 14-year-
olds one-fourth of a vote), critics 
would be Wiser to see SB 1606 as a 
distant cousin of more serious forms 
of voting-age legislation that are real 
threats to the American political sys-
tem and its youth. 

Legislation aimed at lowering the 
minimum voting age has been pro-
po ed in numerous states, including 
Minnesota, Michigan, 
Massachusetts, Ohio, Florida and 
Iowa. Though these bi lls are more 
tempered than SB 1606 (most of 

them call for a minimum age of 16 or 
17), if passed, they could serve as a 
platform from which lawmakers in 
California can be expected to mold 
their own, more realistic and. pass-
able bill or constitutional amend-
ment in the future. 

The main goal of lowering the 
voting age is to spark voter turnout 
Yet IS to 24-year-olds are already far 
less likely to vote than older 
Americans - only 33 percent 
turnout, according the Center for 
Voting and Democracy, compared to 
49 percent for 25 to 44-year-olds 
and 67 percent for those over 65. 
Lowering the voting age to encom-
pass citizens even less politically 
aware than 18-year-olds is Wliikely 
to spur more people to vote. 
Furthermore, teenagers are too 
immature and inexperienced to han-
dle an important decision-making 
processes like voting - the very rea-
son why the voting age has been set 
at 18. 

For many people, it is nor until 
they reach college that they enter a 
political atmosphere in which they 
can openl y discuss issues in an in tel-
lectual, free-thinlcing environment. 
Teenagers are highly dependent on 

their legal guardians and their views 
are easily manipulated by a clever 
campaign, pressures from family or 
peers, and media outlets such as 
MTY. 

Lowering the voting age would 

" Lowering the wting age 
would accomplisht£l 

higher voter turnout only 
at the expense of wter 

rOo ,nl; " 1.1 I-tUUty . 

accomplish a higher voter turnout 
only at the expense of voter quality. 
After all, how many high school stu-
dents, especially those who have not 
yet taken a government class, are 
well-informed about current events 
and politics? Anyone with a young 
sibling would probably scoff at the 
idea that a 14-year-old is capable of 
malcing a well-informed, objective 
and independent political decision. 

Punks: Concert .. goers suffered indoctrination 
continued from page 5 

Original punk music was about 
freedom from ocietal confines, 
free thinking and a cathartic 
release for tho e who felt like the 
irrationality of the world was lead-
ing their generation into destruc-
tIOn. Punk was and till is a very 
dynamic SOCial movement and the 
music is the vOice . But at the 
recent UCSD-sponsored Punk 
Voter T OUT, that voice was pervert-
ed by many belligerent conccrt-
goers. 

I don't want to beli ttle the 
music, but [ think the venue did 
that for us. Free is free, but [ did-
n't know my UCSD 10 afforded 
me some good old political indoc-
tri nation. So much for that punk 
free-thi nking. Granted, Jello 
Biafra 's eloquent acrimony was 
well received considering the 
legitimacy he garnered from the 
epic Dead Kennedys. But the del-
uge of anachronistic CNN video 
clips from the first Gulf War jux-
taposed with Fox News blurbs 
from last week were ridiculous, 
simply manipulating the soft 
minds of those black-nail-pol-
ished, spike-belted 16-year-olds 
into thinlcing that this ignorant 
government skepticism was actu-
ally their own. 

For the "liberals," I suggest we 
compile a video of President 
Jimmy Career and his decisions 
regarding the Ayatollah 
Khomeini . Perhaps JFK's deci-
sions at the Bay of Pigs that almost 
led us into a nuclear holocaust? To 
centralize the issues of a failing 
international structure, the decl ine 
of Pax Americana on a president is 
almost ludicrous, but convenient. I 
understand [ am over-si mplifying. 
And true, I am a registered 
Republican and was a bit out of my 
milieu, but so were a lot of stu-
dents in the crowd just out for 
some solid sets as an alternative to 

" 

the stale silence of Geisel. 
T do not claim co be punk in any 

way, but I don'r support the abra-
sive outbursts of the crowd's neo-
conservatives either. All I am say-
ing is, don't be that guy. That guy 
screaming "Fuck Bush" ad nause-
am, coo sloppy to even register to 
vote. He was an embarrassment 
for those of us who oppo e Bu h 
on educated grounds. Progressive 
ideas are essential to the survival of 
the punk generation. Ignorant 
pugnacity is not punk. So instead 
of using those two hours it takes 
you to get that "I don't give a fuck" 
mohawk or to memorize the life 
history of Sid Vicious, listen to 
those POll 142K lectures, find 
out who Thomas Friedman is, and 
perhaps develop a rational solution 
to all that social angst.

Ed Wu's column had 
glaring inaccuracies 

Editor: 
[ let the first one slide. I wrote 

off Ed Wu's ridiculously ill-
informed opinion article (April I) 
as a continuation of the GUIlrditm's 
April Fool's prank. I even tried to 
schedule a meeting with him to 
discuss his story, but he didn't 
show up and now I am forced to 
read another poorly researched 
article (April IS) fraught with 
flawed claims about athletics at 
UCSD. 

First and foremost , let me 
remind Mr. Wu that four of the 
fi ve candidates sough t the 
endorsement of the 600-plus stu-
dent athletes through their repre-
sentative body, the Triton Athletic 
Council. Jenn Pae did not pander 
or make false promises, her hon-
esty and commitment to Triton 

a thletics won her the support, 
appreciation and credibi lity of 
UCSD's student athletes. 

Secondly, had Mr. Wu done 
any substantive research, he would 
have discovered that TritOn Tide is 
an A.S. service and is 99 percent 
funded by the Associated Students: 
it i the A.S. pre ident who sub-
mi ts the A.S. budget. If he calls 
doi ng a job successfully "pander-
ing," then I think it is about time 
for Mr. Wu to start "pandering" to 
the students who pick up the 
Guardian . 

In addition to unfairly chastis-
ing our president-elect, Mr. Wu 
decided to once again venture into 
his favorite venue of unfounded 
criticism of the intercollegiate 
athletics department. Yes, our fee 
referendum does allocate student 
fees toward athletics. But that ref-
erendum was not only written at 
the absolute minimum level of 
funding but was also approved in 
one of the highest voted-in elec-
tions in memory, receiving more 
tlhan two-thirds support of the 29 
percent of students who turned 
out to vote. 

Apparently, Mr. Wu once 
again forgot to conduct any mean-
ingful research or interviews. If he 
had, I am sure someone would 
have informed him that two-thirds 
ofUCSD voters care about athlet-
ics. 

While Mr. Wu's obvious dis-
dain for athletics, spirit and a 
broader sense of community at 
UCSD has permanently clouded 
his judgment, I invite anyone 
interested in malcing a lasting 
change to our campus climate to 
attend a Triton Tide meeting. 
Meetings are held every Monday 
at 4 p.m. on the third floor of 
Price Center.

Proponents ofSB 1606 claim that 
the bill would inspire and prepare 
youth to responsibly involve them-
selves in politics. But college seems a 
more fitting atmosphere to intro-
duce young adults to participatory 
politics. The age of 18 carries with it 
numerous new responsibilities, and 
it is the beginning of true indepen-
dence. Thus, 18 is a reasonable age 
at which individuals should be 
empowered with the weighty 
responsibility associated with suf-
frage. 

However, even if lowering the 
voting age did have some effect of 
politicaUy mobilizing teenagers, 
would that be a preferable outcome? 
Teenagers are already overwhelmed 
with the pressures of school, 
extracurricular activities and grow-
ing up. There is no reason to add 
civic duty to a teenager's lis.t of 
responsi bili ties, especially when he 
or she is unprepared to shoulder the 
burden of having the vote. American 
youths are already rushed through 
childhood, and it's wmecessary to 
quicken this push to adulthood. 

Then what of the sob stories 
about 17 -year,,>ld seniors whose 
birthdays are a day after the registra-

tion deadline? The phrase "tough 
luck" comes to mind first, quicldy 
followed by, "there is always next 
year." No matter what the voting age 
limit, there will aI ways be someone 
who gets left out. 

Even if, however, a teenager is so 
interested in politics that he or she 
cannot wait for his or her ISth birth-
day, there are cOWldess ways to get 
involved in politics that do not result 
in the "I Voted" sticker. Voting is a 
basic and superficial form of political 
participation. Those ineligible to 
vote can still influence politics by 
volunteering time or money for a 
candidate or party, going to protests, 
and participating in countless other 
forms of civic involvement. 

It is doubtful that the extreme 
catastrophes predicted by opponents 
of SB 1606 would occur if the voting 
age was lowered. Brimey Spears 
would probably not be elected presi-
dent, and the national anthem would 
not be rewritten by rapper SO Cent. 
Instead, such a bill would unneces-
sarily rush teenagers toward adult-
hood, placing an important decision 
in the hands of individuals who are 
not intellectually and socially pre-
pared to make it. 

Indecent: Nonscience? 
More like noncompliant 
continued from page 5 

you realize the error of your non-
scientifi c ways, but you buy into 
the superiority of math, science 
and engineeri ng in crafting yo ur 
idealized identity. In dire straits, 
m:lodramatic sobs accompanied 
by cries of "I just wanted to be as 
cool as you!" will work JUSt fi ne. 

Every university has its "joke" 
majors and intellectual underclass . 
The Rochester Institute of 
Technology in Rochester, N.Y., 
offers a major in pack.aging sci-

" 

ence, and psychology don't count 
as "real science," beca use they 
hardly have the earning potential 
and level of masochism that stud y-
ing a "hard" (as in, difficult) sci-
ence does. 

I realize now that UCSD's 
belittling of anything nonscientif· 
ic is not only justified, but \'3Iu-
able. Clearly, non-science majors 
are leeches who suck the lifeblood 
out of society. The world doesn't 
need any more lawyers, writers, 
artists, linguists, psychologists or 

other pseudo-intel-
lectuals: It needs 

ence - designing 
boxes and, if you 
really get excited, 
working on a pill 
bottle that is real-
ly, truly, impossi-
ble to open. 
Many universities 
offer degrees in 
physical educa-
tion; those who 
choose this major 
certainly deserve 
ridicule, but are 
spared on account 
of their bulldoz-
er-like physiques. 
And then there's 
interior design, 
apparel, textiles, 
nutrition, 

The uorld che.m't 
more engineers and 
scientific 
researchers. The 
ideal America is one 
in which high-
speed jets are 
designed and per-
fected, but no rock 
stars to ride in 
them. One in which 
the clever phrasing 
used in an article in 
the journal Science 
is all the great liter-
ature a person 

need any mare 
kauyers, writers, 
artists, linguists, 

psyd1dogists or other 
pseudcrintellectuals: 

It needs mare 
engineers and 

scientific researchers, " needs. One ifl which museums 
don't house art or 

forestry, and - the obvious and 
universal target of derision -
communication. 

At UCSD, though, we are gen-
erous with our stigmatization, so a 
"joke major" is any subject that 
doesn't involve a brick-sized cal-
culator, complex equations, 
obscure theorems, problem sets, 
gulping coffee all night during 
your six-year college career, exam 
curves set at 30 percent, and sell-
ing one's soul in exchange for the 
promise of a lucrative, secure job 
after college - in other words, 
anything but math, science and 
engineering. Management sci-
ence, political science, social sci-

archeological arti-
facts, but rather foam-and-balsa-
wood models of smaller museums. 

Consider yourselves warned, 
non-science majors. Lie to your 
peers now, to save face; and at the 
first opportunity, change your 
major to something real. 
Otherwise Western civilization -
and your social life - are sure to 
suffer.

THURSDA~, APRIL 22. 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Admits: Female admit rate on the rise 
continlM?d from page I 

of increasing the number of under-
represented students," Mae W. 
Brown, the assistant vice chancellor 
of admissions and enrollment ser-
vices said. "We're concerned with 
the drop in underrepresented stu-
dents, especially with the drop of 
African Americans on campus. " 

Across all UC campuses, more 
than IS percent fewer African 
Americans received admission, the 
largest annual drop among all eth-
nic groups. There was a 9.6 per-
cent decrease at UCSD. 

"Overall, it's disappointing to 
see these numbers go down, espe-
cially since chronically, in our uni-
versity and our system, there never 
have been numbers that meet the 
demographics of our state or our 
area," A.S . Commissioner of 
Diversity Affairs Stephanie Aguon 
said. "It makes it difficult to create 
the lcind of campus climate that we 
want, if students are being cut." 

Brown and Aguon blamed the 
poor number of underrepresented 
admits partly on tuition fees hikes 
and state cuts in funding for out-
reach programs. 

"We absolutely need to look at 
the implications of the cuts in out-
reach. I think those programs are . 
quite essential in maintaining the 
diversity of the campus," Brown 
said. 

Aguon said her office would 
continue work on the creation of a 
recruitment and retention center, 
like those at UC Berkeley and 
other universities. She believes the 
centers would help raise the num-
bers for underrepresented stu-
dents. 

The proportion of students who 
are first in their family to attend 
college, have a family income below 
530,000, or come from low-per-
forming schools rose slightly across 
the UC system. At UCSD, more 
than 23 percent of admitted stu-

dents represented the first in their 
family to go to college, according 
to university data. 

Females conti~ued to outpace 
males at all campuses, occupying 
more than 57 percent of UCSD's 
admission spaces. 

This rising number of female 
admissions represents a "national 
phenomenon," Brown said. 

UC-eligible students denied 
admission in 2004-05 received a 
Guaranteed Transfer Option. It is a 
new program that promises appli-
cants a spot at a UC campus after 
two years of community college. 
Under Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger's budget proposal, 
currently pending in the 
Legislature, their community col-
lege fees would be waived. 

African Americans comprised 
nearly a quarter of the GTO stu-
dents, the second-largest etlhnic 
group, behind Caucasians, to be 
offered the option.

plausible considering the capacity 
would be lowered, and more stu-
dents would have been turned away 
from the event," Dawson said. "We 
got capacity without splitting the 
ballrooms; if we would have split 
the ballroom, we would have had to 
let in 250 or so less people." 

Chiu said that some of the dee-
jays he had scheduled for the dance 
traveled from Los Angeles and did 
not receive any notice that the set-
up for the dance had been changed. 

"There was a lot· of effort made 
in solving scheduling problems for 
the event and that made it doubly 
disappointing," Chiu said. "The 
basic contract was advertising for 

services and that was the big kicker, 
even if the party had not gone 
through." 

However, Dawson disputed the 
claims that he had not informed 
DVC members about the change. 
Dawson added that there was no 
formal agreement regarding the 
possibility of rain and he did call 
DVC members at 3:30 p.m. on 
April 2. 

"There was no 'what if in case of 
rain agreement' because I didn't 
think it would rain," Dawson said. 
"I called DVC as soon as the PC 
tech .people had to cancel the out-
side part of the event around 3 :30 
p.m. I didn't want to do it, but I had 
no choiCe - it was either (turn 

away] DVC or turn away students." 
The Judicial Board met on 

April 21 and decided that it will 
hear the case within the next few 
weeks. Judicial Board Chair Aaron 
Ezroj said that it must check the 
availability of those involved in the 
case. 

"The schedule of the Judicial 
Board in terms of the case will be 
any time within the next twO 
weeks," Ezroj said. "We probably 
won't know a date set for the hear-
ing until next Monday or 
Tuesday." 

According to Chiu, if the DVC 
wins the case, they will ask for a full 
page ad in The GUIlrdian as com-
pensation.

also pay a $20 administrative and

With 1,000 hits daily on his 
Web site at its peak, Jung said his 
"student-friendly" and free service 
provides useful benefits for the stu-
dent body by finding the cheapest 
available book prices.

do not, according to Jung. He 
claims he has earned only roughly 
enough money to cover his expens-
es,Jung said, explaining that he did 
not start the service as a business. 

According to Conner, UCSD 
Bookstore has been aggressive about 
protecting its designs, with at least 
six letters like Jung's sent out within 
the last two years to other individu-
als using logos similar to UCSD 
Bookstore~ trademark. After being 
notified, all six complied with the 
university's request, she said. 

The campus bookstore also 
wants to guard its reputation, Turk 
said. 

"The main reason that we want 

to protect the trademarks is that if 
[they] are used by organizations we 
don't know about, we risk losing 
control of the trademarks and dam-
age to our image," he said. 

Though Jung said he's not sure 
if the laws cited by Parode apply to 
his service, since he doesn't direct-
ly sell books but simply provides 
prices, he believes he would not 
likely win against the university. 

"I am a senior and I really want 
to graduate," Jung said. "If at the 
end it~ going to require a court 
battle, I don't see it as feasible for 
me. I'm under no illusion that I 
have the means to compete against 
[the university]."

8 NEWS THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Protest: Activists demand stop to testing 
continued from page 2 

Suffering, said. 
Jane Cartmill, a member of San 

Diego Animal Advocates who 
dressed up for the protest in a 
Frankenstein costume, echoed the 
sentiment. 

"I think [the UCSD policy) 
sounds good on paper, but like all 
of the .institutional animal care 
guidelines, they are pretty much 
self-regulated," Cartmill said. 
"When you read the Animal 
Welfare Act, you realize how 
much is left up to the discretion of 
the individual investigator. 
Because of that, it's like the fox 
guarding the hen house. We're not 
comforted by the fact that they 
have what they call a policy of 
humane care." 

Chiba said that animal test sub-
jects are usually prorected by regu-
lations and cared for by 
researchers. 

"The animals are covered by 
several government regulations," 
Chiba said. "You really can't get 
good research when the animals 
aren't well cared for." 

The activists emphasized the 
importance of allocating money to 
prevent health-related diseases, 
rather than using animal testing to 
find new cures. Protesters cited sta-
tistics from the American Cancer 
Society, stating that 70 to 80 per-
cent of cancer is preventable, but 
70 to 80 percent of funding is not 
going toward prevention. 

"We're wasting billions of dol-
lars on research that has not really 
proven to be productive," Sid 
Shapiro, a member of San Diego 
Animal Advocates, said. "We'd be 
much better served by spending 
that money on preventative health 
care." 

Chiba emphasized that the ani-
mal testi ng at school was useful 

for medical and veterinary 
research. 

"The one thing that people 
should be aware of is that the ani-
mal research conducted at UCSD 
is aimed at medical research and is 
even better for animals sometimes, 
because a lot of the research goes 
toward veterinary techniques,". 
Chiba said. 

Students Against Animal 
Suffering, which was involved in 
the campaign to end the use of dog 
labs at UCSD and in a campaign 
against fur clothing sold at Neiman 
Marcus, will disseminate more 
information on animal testing for 
commercial and medical research 
on campus April 22 . 

"We'd JUSt like [UCSD) to start 
phasing out animal testing and to 
take a responsible position because 
animal testing ... is outdated, it's 
unnecessary, and it 's absolutely 
cruel," Sewell said. 

Silence: Students share personal experiences 
continued from page 1 

people that I support them, and 
[the event) is a nice visual way to do 
that," Revelle College freshman 
Kristine Dougherty said. 

Others spoke about the how 
Important the event was and their 
own personal reasons for partici-
pating in the event. 

"The reality is that members of 
the LGBTI community and its 
allies are silenced every day and 
can't tal k about their problems in 
most private and public spaces and 
can't voice their identity," said 
Revelle College senior Ted 
McCombs. "We do this to show 
how much silence disrupts the 
community." 

Other pan:icipams noted their 
experiences with members of The 
Koala, who had set up a table near 
the table where Day of Silence par-
ticipants were having lunch. 
Members of the Koala were also 
handing out the publication on 
Library Walk. 

Sonnad said that while members 

of the Koala were trying to break 
the silence of some of the partici-
pants, the incidents did not take 
away from the event. 

"It didn't even detract from the 
sincerity of the event," Sonnad said. 

Organizers estimate that 
approximately 100 people came to 
the dinner and about 100 to 150 
people attended the silent lunch 
table throughout the day. 
Organizers also said that 300 t-
shirts in total were handed out for 
the event. 

"This has been rcally successful 
and we've had more involvement 
than in past years," Sonnad said. 
"We're hoping thar in the future 
we'll continue to grow because it's a 
really important event and we hope 
that people in the future are made 
aware that they should support the 
community." 

Along with Day of Silence, Hate 
Free Campus Week consisted of 
events such as a 24-hour reading of 
names of people who were killed 
during the Holocaust starting on 

April 18, Armenian Genocide Day 
of Remembrance on April 20, and 
various activities held at the differ-
ent colleges. 

"I think it's really important that 
UCSD finds a way as a campus 
community to say no to hate and 
prejudice collectively as a way to 
really lift that up and to raise 
awareness," SOHR Director Gaty 
Anderson said. 

With the theme "Dialogues 
Across Difference," events during 
the week focus on issues of hate and 
intolerance. The fifth annual event 
continues throughout the week 
with a film screening of "Anlerican 
History X" on April 22 at the 
Cross-Cultural Center, sketch per-
formances on April 23 at the 
International Center Cafe by the 
SOHR Troupe, and various discus-
sion panels. 

«What we're trying to do is 
engage the whole campus in dia-
logue, so that it's not just cere-
monies where people watch, but 
that talk about it," Anderson said.

THURSDAY, APRIL 22, 2004 

The mission statement of this year's San Diego International Film Festival 
sounds terribly overreaching and 
idealistic given the national and 
global political anxieties sweeping 
the nation . At a time when ten-
sions in Iraq are increasing every 
day, it seems the last thing on 
one's mind should be "watching 
movies." If anything, to regard a 
movie as a remedy for the intense-
ly distre sing problems of modern 
society would be heinous. Could 
anyone really be so idealistic as to 
think that a single film could 
change things) Can one film real-
ly marter that much? 

For the late Ruth Bailey of 
University Events Office, a film 
could change the world. As the 
founder and director of the 
SDIFF, Bailey organized the festi-
val for nearly twenty years at 
UCSD, and her great love was 
cinema. Believing that film was a 
way of bridging gaps beTWeen 
cOl1ntries and cultures, a way of 
showing the interconnectedness 
of humanity, she was adamant in 
acquiring films from all across the 
world . She established many per-

sonal contacts in several foreign 
nations via consulates and ambas-
sadors in such places as South 
Korea and mainland China. 

However, at a great loss to the 
UCSD community, she passed 
a wa y unexpectedl y last July. In her 
absence, the very future of the 
SDIFF was jeopardized. Filling 
her position as the new festival 
directors, Martin Wollesen, Amy 
Thomas and undergraduate Rinee 
Shah have worked against great 
odds to make the annual festival a 
reality. 

UEO, which runs the SDIFF, 
also programs events such as the 
Sun God Festival, in addition to 
Mandeville AuditOrium and 
RIMAC concerts, among other 
things. With such an impacted 
schedule, the festival seemed almost 
impossible given Baileys death. 

"We came to the conclusion 
that we couldn't do a full-week 
festiva l. But we also felt thar it was 
critically important to continue a 
presence," Wollesen said. 

Lacking Baileys experience and 
international contacts, the directors 
faced the bureaucratic and multi-
layered process of requesting and

soLiciting foreign film from inter-
national distributors. Given this 
difficulty, the directors had to rely 
primarily upon local and national 
submissions in a call-for-entry. 
Wollesen explains, "What that

Festival 

means is that there is greater 
weight on U.S. tilmmaking than 
the international." 

Wollesen, Thomas and Shah 
aren't exactly fighting this battle 
alone, though. On April 15 on 
local television neTWork KPBS, 
Beth Accomando, a San Diego-

based film critic and long time sup-
porter of the SDIFF, heralded the 
festival with a feature on the pro-
gram "Full Focus." Other critics 
such as David Elliot of the Sim 
Ditgo Uniqn-Tribum and Duncan 
Shephard of the San Diego Reader 
have also voiced their enthusiasm. 

And without a doubt, commu-
nity participation has been strong 
over the years, as the SDIFF is the 
only international film festival in 
town. Wollesen also anticipates a 
good deal of student involvement. 
''In the past, our student atten-
dance was really quite high, and 
we anticipate that will be the case 
again," she said. "We know that 
there will be some classes attend-
ing as well." 

With student attendance high-
er than any other UC film festival, 
the SDIFF audience promises to 
be an interesting blend. "I feel it's 
very important that students go," 
Shah said. " I've overlooked the 
festival in the past ... We're trying 
to get the word out a lot more." 

Watching over 100 submis-
sions, mostly shorts, the artistic 
curators selected the most out-
standing and significant works to 

be featured at this year's festival. 
The three-day program includes 
themes such as: "The Light and 
Dark of It," shorts ranging from 
the romantically sentimental to the 
absurdly dark; "Animals and 
Kitsch," including fuzzy creatures 
and campy teen hwnor; "Animated 
World," highlighting the oft-over-
looked medium of animation; and 
"Brief Investigations," which are 
"really exciting non-narrat,ive 
experimental films." 

Amidst the sizeable array of 
shorts, the feature films promise 
for memorable viewings . The 
full-lengths, many from the inter-
national scene (Russia, Israel, 
Iraq, Italy), are complex dramas, 
plumbing the human psyche and 
exposing peoples greatest fears. 
The premiere feature, the Italian 
"10 Non Ho Paura" ("I'm Nor 
Scared") by director Gabriele 
Salvatores of Academy Award-
winning "Mediterraneo" recogni-
tion, is the story of innocence lost.

Art floods the streets of Little Italy with ArtWaik 2004 
San Diego and Tijuana artists display their work, local bands add flavor to the event' 
By W MAl and ANN SHEN 

Staff Writers 

San Diego's largest urban arts event, ArtWalk, returns to Little Italy in Downtown San 
Diego for its 20th anniversary on 
April 24 and April 25. Initially a San 
Diego- based effort, Artwalk has 
grown to become a binational art 
and music festival that celebrates 
various art forms and cultures. 

This year's event maries the 20th 
anniversary of this celebration of 
art and will appeal to a wide assort-
ment of people, with over 400 
artists and their work in various 
mediums, including paint, sculp-
ture, dance, electronic imaging, 

poetry, drama and architecture - a 
category that may even attract 
engineers! 

For those who don't quite 
understand the concept behind 
ArtWalk, it's a one-mile route 
through Little Italy that shows off 
the great efforts of nationally 
known artists from both sides of 
the border. A fusion of San Diego 
and TIjuana artists, there is a wide 
range of artwork ftom all genres 
but this year, 12 specific artists 
were chosen for exhibition in the 
visual arts spectrum to represent 
ArtWalk itself, including Michelle 
Abrams and Igor Koutsenko. 
Abrams' work .can be seen at 
Abrams Art Studio in Point Lorna, 

and Koutsenko's artwork appeared 
on Bravo's "Artbreak." All in all, 
the collaboration of their work pro-
duces a medley of very different 
artistic styles, techniques, cultures 
and most importantly, personas. 

ArtWalk reveals the talents of 
these artists, but also gives people 
an opportunity to interact with the 
artists and possibly buy a piece of 
work. It's a chance for citizens of 
San Diego and tourists to become 
acquainted with and gain insight 
into the different elements of art. 
The worles will be on display in 
local businesses, booths, studios 
and outdoor galleries. 

Performing artists will also bring 
the streets of Little Italy to life with 

their personal brands of music. 
Thirteen local bands will play on 
every street comer, bringing a sort of 
Balboa Park atmosphere to 
Downtown. There will be some-
thing for everyone, ranging from fla-
menco guitarists to garage indie 
rock. 

Feel free to bring the kids, as 
ArtWalk offers an interactive 
KidsWalk, with instruction from 
local artists and hands-on projects. 
The incredible opportunity for 
children to interact directly with 
the artists themselves facilitates an 
atmosphere where children can 
become burgeoning art aficiona-
dos. Some artists' booths will be 
classified as "kid-friendly art" so 

that parents can rest assured their 
children will be safe in a boob-
flashing-free environment. 

ArtWalk is sponsored and pro-
grammed by several local nonprof-
it art and civic organi:r.ations 
including San Diego An Institute, 
San Diego Performing Arts 
League, Institute for Arts 
Education, San Diego Dance 
AllIance, Museum of 
Contemporary Art San Diego and 
many more.

THURSDAY, APRIL 22, 2004 THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS II 

Hip-hop heavy hitters grace San Diego 
The Roots perform along with the Pharcyde and Cee-Lo 

By BillY Gil 
Associate Hiatus Editor 

To have one great hip-hop act in San Diego is a treat, but it's almost 
unheard of to have three 

in one night. The Roots head-
line a three-act show at Jenny 
Craig Pavilion on April 23 
with the Pharcyde and Cee-
Lo that should prove to be 
one of the most memorable 
shows in recent memory. 
Both the Roots and the 
Pharcyde bear the repmations 
of being among the best hip-
hop performers around. 

Thc Roots' moniker 
seems to reference the 
"roots" of hip-hop - that is, 
they perform as a live band 
apt to incorporate jazz, funk, 
blues and rock into the for-
mula. Despite this, the band 
has taken time to break 
through with fans of the 
genre. The Philadelphia-
based group, formed by rap-
per Black Thought and 
drummer ?uestlove 15 years 
ago, has steadily moved from 
a promising underground 
group to an impressively 
bold entity at the forefront 
of musical adventurousness. 

The Roots' place as an 
"alternative" hip-hop group 
was instituted in the 1990s by 
stints at Lollapalooza and 
albums that, while well-
received critically, didn't make 
a strong impact witJi record-
buyers. The band was accused 
of being too heady and conde-
scending to mainstream hip-
hop. Their video for the song 
"What They Do" may have 
wickedly skewered rap video 

cliche with such labeled 
scenes as "the beat down 
shot," but it did little to win 
over hip-hop fans looking for 
a record to groove to - not 
one to preach to them. 

In 1999, the Roots 
released their fourth album 
Things Fait Apart and the 
music world took notice. The 
excellent duet with Erykah 
Badu "You Got Me" (co-writ-
ten by a then-unknown Jill 
Scott) won the band a 
Grammy. In 2002, the ~oots 

" 'What They Do' 
wickedly skewered 
... rap video cliche 
with such labeled 
scenes as 'the beat 
down ho ' " s t ... 

released PhrtnoWr;y, and while 
it was not a commercial 
smash, it became one of the 
most talked-about albums of 
the year, gracing various year-
end lists and further establish-
ing the group as mainstays. 

Though much has been 
made of Phrmokir;y's versatil-
ity, it is, in reality, a terrific 
hip-hop album with van·ous 
influences thoughtfully 
incorporated. It's not a "rap-
rock" record; the extent of 
the "rock" is a 24-second 
hardcore punk workout enti-
tled "!!I!!!!" and "The Seed 
(2.0)," a duet with soul-rock-
er Cody Chesnutt that is so 

supremely effective it should 
have been the biggest single 
of 2003 . Elsewhere, the band 
delivers heavy no-nonsense 
rap in "Rock You" and elab-
orates their catchy hip-hop 
duet formula with Musiq on 
"Break You Off." 

Perhaps most alarming is 
"Water," a 10-minute addic-
tion epitaph with an extended 
noise break that point~ further 
to Sonic Youth than De La 
Soul. Yet for all its conscious 
weirdness, Phrmokir;y is a fun, 
exciting record that doesn't 
feel as weighty as it could 
have. It shows the group 
refining its already ingenious 
approach and capturing the 
spirit of unscripted live per-
formance on record. 

Performing with the 
Roots are the Pharcyde, one 
of the most inventive hip-hop 
acts of the past decade. 
Though they haven't released 
an album in years, the oft-
sampled Pharcyde are rou-
tinely mentioned as a highly 
influential group in expanding 
hip-hop's horizons with a 
complex, almost psychedelic 
sound. Also performing is 
Cee-Lo, the former Goodie 
Mob rapper with a lauded 
new solo album, Cee-fA Grtm 
... Is The Soul MlIChint. The 
chubby-yet-swank Cee-Lo 
rhymes with off-color sensi-
bility in a throaty, recogniz-
able voice that has won his 
work due attention, and the 
TImbaland-produced "I'll Be 
Around" has gained him com-
mercial footing as well. 

Tickets are $30 to the gen-
eral public and can be pur-
chased through TIckerrnaster. 

HIp-hop 1reIl: As one of the most respected live hiJHlop groups, the Roots attract a wide audience. 
They win be peIfomlng at USD's Jemy Craig Pavilion along with Pharc:yde and Cee-\.o on April 23. 

SDIFF: Festival captures spirit of founder 
continued from pa,e 10 

startling secret that forcibly 
removes him from the safety 
of childhood. 

"At a point in modern 
Italian cinema, where most 
films celebrate lighthearted-
ness and comedy, it is 
refreshing to see a starker 
image that lets as a thriller," 
Wollesen said. 

Another notable 61m 
about the trauma of disrupt-
ed youth is the American 
feature, "Girlhood," by Liz 
Garbus. Also Academy 
Award-nominated for "The 
Farm, Angola," Garbus doc-
uments the lives of TWO 
young girls in Maryland's 
WaXler Juvenile Facility: 

Shanae, a victim of a vicious 
gang-rape who turned to 
drugs and murder; and 
Megan, a child abandoned 
by her heroin-addict mother. 
"Girlhood" is an unftinching 
portrait of abused young 
women striving against 
adversity. 

April 24's opening feature, 
"About Baghdad, " an 
American film by exiled Iraqi 
poet Sinan Antoon, is a time-
ly and harrowing documen-
tary, relating Antoon's return 
visit to a besieged Iraq .. 

"What you see tim~ and 
again throughout 'About 
Baghdad' is how people are 
struggling with really basic 
things," Thomas said. "The 

61m goes beyond politics, 
beyond governments." 

Though less ambitious 
than Bailey's incomparable 
1O-day festival runs, this year's 
SDIFF is an endearing and 
hard-fought gesture in mem-
ory of a woman who loved 
and championed 61ms as 
vehicles for humanitarian 
force. According to the mis-
sion statement, in a world 
that is "complex, frightening, 
and hopelessly beautiful," 
Bailey's venturesome and 
compassionate spirit is vividly 
reflected in these films. 

TIckets for the SDIFF can 
be purchased at the UCSD 
Box Office in person or by 
calling (858) 534-TIXS.

12 HIATUS 

Late-Night Silent Films 
find new home at Che 

Experimental films from early 20th century 
accompanied by the Teeny-Tiny Pit Orchestra 

By ANN SHEN 
Staff Writer 

The Late-Night Silent Film Series is going to be shown in its new home, Che Cafe, on April 
28 and May 12. Originally run in . 
Geisel Library previous years, the 
Che Cafe takes over to add more 
srudenr -friendly activities to their 
current repertoire of events, includ-
ing a weekly open mic. 

The event adheres to the belief 
that silent films should be shown the 
way they were meant to be seen: 
with a live band. The silent film 
series will feature the Teeny-TIny 
Pit Orchestra for Silent Films, 
directed by musician Scott Paulson. 
Accompanied by bells, whisdes, per-
cussion and woodwinds, Paulson 
describes the Teeny-TIny Pit 
Orchesrra for Silent Films as early 
experimental music to match the 
early experimental films.' The 
orchestra will be performing music 
to match the decade era of the films, 
combining improvisation with clas-
sic silent-film era style music. 

Most of the fil ms shown will be 
trick photography and experimen-
tal-era films from classic directors, 
including "A Corner in Wheat" 
(1909) directed by D.W Griffith, 
an underrated i1ent-era film about 
the rise and fall of a callous manip-
ulator and the social consequences 

of his actions. Psst ... it includes a 
fantastic death scene. 

Along the lines of experimental 
filmography is the 1912 film 
"Revenge of the Kinematograph 
Cameraman" directed by Ladis 
Starevich, which will also be 
screened. "Revenge" is described as 
an experimental stop-action ani-
mated tale about insect lovers 
caught in a Paris Hilton-type of 
scandal. Other films to be screened 
include "Felix the Cat Dines and 
Pines" (1927) by Pat Sullivan and 
Otto Messmer, a tale that will make 
you want to become a vegetarian. 
"The Electric House" (1922) 
directed by Buster Keaton, is a 
slapstick comedy about a house 
rigged with electrical gadgets that 
don't work right. 

For those who have short atten-
tion spans, the films range from six 
to 20 minutes long. An extra special 
spice in the evening is the faCt that 
audience members will contribute to 
the sound effectS. Paulson will direct 
special sound effect solos for view-
ers, and allow certain gutsy audience 
members to play his therernin. 

Che Cafe is located on Scholars 
Drive South at UCSD, and will pre-
miere the Late-Night Silent Film 
Series starting April 28. Shows will 
run from 10 p.m. to midnight. Call 
Paulson at (858) 534-8074 for more 
information.

Anne Cong-huyen 
uentin larantino is more than Q JUSt an odd man who makes grotesquely violent movies -he's brilliant. When many 
directors are simply pumping 

out films written by talentless 
hacks in order to make a few 
bucks, Tarantino sets an example 
by breaking from convention and 
pouring himself into films that are 
truly his own. 

In his efforts, Tarantino made 
the ultimate chick flick: "Kill 
Bill." By now, you must all know 
the bloody story of the Bride, 
played to perfection by Uma 
T hurman, who is bent on revenge 
and sets out to kill her former 
Deadly Viper Assassin Squad 
members and their boss Bill. 

"Kill Bill" defini tely does not 
sound like a typical "chick flick" 
and that's because it isn't. So-
called "chick flicks" arc normally 
lighthearted romantic comedies 
with contrived endings. Girl 
meets boy. girl likes boy, boy takes 
90 minutes to realize he likes girl, 
so on and so forth . That's the gen-
eral gist of most "chick flicks." For 
the most part they are unoriginal 
films where women occupy the 
same roles they always do. 
Women are almost always defined 
oppositionally to men with little 
agency of their own and no real 
equality, for the most part. Girls 
are girls. Boys are boys. And that's 
the end of tha t. 

Let's take a look at some of 
these popular "chick flicks." 

Now, "Pretty Woman" has 
become somewhat of a classic as a 
modem-day Cinderella story, yet 
the story itself is trapped in a 
male-dominated history where 
the female is completely at the will 

of men. Julia Roberts plays a pros-
tirute who gives the ruthless busi-
nessman (Richard Gere) a heart 
with her free spirit and good 
lovin'. Cute as the interactions 
are, it becomes thoroughly disap-
pointing because Roberts' charac-
ter is dependent on her rich sugar-
daddy. When she is attacked by 
his parmer (Jason Alexander), she 
is unable to do anything but flail 
about and scream until her knight 
in a three-piece suit comes and 
saves her. I know women are, for 
the most part, not as physically 
strong as men, but wouldn 't an 
experienced lady of the night 
know how to ward off unwanted 
advances by dirty sleazebags? 

" ... she doesn't sit there 
and wail 'woe is me.' Oh 
heU no. She makes those 

bastards pay." 
And how about the ever-popu-

lar "Grease"? OK, I admit this 
movie has catchy songs; bu t this 
must be one of the most degrad-
ing stories ever. Sandy (Olivia 
Newton-John) is a poodle-skirt 
square and Danny (John Travolta) 
is a leather-jacket-sporting T-
Bird. How will it ever work out 
between the two? Easy. She just 
has to give up her identity and 
conform to what Danny wants: 
tight clothes, chemically treated 
hair, massive make-up and fume-
filled lungs. Sure, he may have 
donned a letterman's jacket for a 
bit, but that came flying off the 
instant Sandy showed up in the 
skintight black pants. Are film-
makers telling women that con-
formity to social ideals of sexiness 
and femininity will lead to happi-
ness? Wait .. , that doesn't sound 
right. 

But Quentin Tarantino, brave 

soul that he is, created the ulti-
mate of female characters by mak-
ing "Kill Bill ." The Bride is 
strong, skilled and will stop at 
nothing to right a wrong commit-
ted against her. For the first time I 
can think of in cinematic history, 
Tarantino has created a female 
character with male skills and 
there are no compromises. She's 
as human as you and me, with the 
same emotions and the same 
weaknesses, only shes a hundred 
times more bad-ass. 

When she wakes up from her 
coma and realizes that her baby is 
gone, what follows is an intensely 
emotional scene that is iocredibly 
realistic for a woman who loses an 
anticipated child. Credit must be 
given to Thurman for her excep-
tional performance. She is truly 
uncompromising. In the same . 
sequence, when the Bride finds 
out that she had been violated in 
her comatose state, she doesn't sit 
there and wail "woe is me." Oh 
hell no. She makes those bastards 
pay. 

Another stunning female char-
acter in "Kill Bill" is Go Go 
Yubari, the innocent-looking 
teenage assassin in a Japanese 
school uniform. As cute as she 
may seem, the lady is lethal. The 
most exciting scene, though, is 
when Go Go takes the ultimate 
male act of domination - pene-
tration - and makes it her own. 
No use of kinlcy sex toys, she's just 
downright strong and the ultimate 
female who does not live confined 
by rules made by men. 

Of course, there are holes and 
visible inconsistencies in the film, 
but it can't be perfect; nothing is. 
What is really outstanding, 
though, is the complete bravery 
with which Tarantino made his 
film. "Kill Bill" was made without 
compromising the female charac-
ters. They all have histories and 
they are all human, yet they all 
have the ability to run up and 
chop off your head. Now how 
brilliant is that? 

Oesprte taking itself too seriously, 'Spring 
Summer, Winter, Fall, Spring' is vi~ually pleasing 

By CUFFORD HILO 
Staff Writer 

Like the B-movie director Ed Wood - a man so in love with making movies that he really 
couldn't understand how sub-stan-
dard they actually were - Korean 
director Kim Ki-duk is too in love 
with Buddhism. In his new feature, 
"Spring, Summer, Fall, Wmter, 
Spring," Kim badly wants to show 
audiences his reverence to the point 
that he wrote himself into the film as 
the "once-neophyte, now-master" 
monk - as if directing weren't 
enough. Rather than making such a 
self-indulgent gesture, he should 
have paid more attention to the 
film's message. 

True to the tide, the film moves 
cyclically through the life of an 
apprentice monk under the tutelage 
of his senior. Like the young 
Siddartha, the youth learns his life 
lessons the hard way, experiencing 
the full spectrum of humanity, from 
the serene and tixed setting of the 
isolated, floating monastery to the 
fury and disillusionment of the 
removed, unseen outside. 

Though the premise sounds epic 
and thoughtful, the film itself is not. 
The idyllic, lush backdrop and char-
acters remind viewers of the unfold-
ing plot, but "Spring" goes nuts and 
starts genre-blending like amalgam-
enthusiast Quentin Tarantino, bor-
rowing elements from K-Pop melo-
drama, hard-boiled detective 
thriller, and sadly enough, even 
chopsocky extravaganza. 

But unlike Tarantino's playful 
affection, "Spring" takes itself 
deadly serious. Take for example 
when Kim Ki-duk fills the role of 
the budding monk and, out of 
nowhere, produces a martial arts 
manual. Then, in images replete 

Film 
REVIEW 

with mid-action freeze frames a la 
"Bloodsport," he starts soaring and 
jump-kicking across the screen. 
However, his "kung fu chops" 
aren't meant to be obscene and 
incongruous - they're just mis-
guided veneration. 

As a counterpoint, the film isn't 
entirely awful. "Spring" draws as 
much as it can from the breathtaking 
landscape of Jusan Pond, a place 
where verdant, bowing forest 
canopies and water-logged shores 
possess inherent partic force. There 
are also striking images that brink 
on the surreal: an immolated monk, 
whose facial features are masked 
with paper votives, and a fish bound 
with string and rock. Yet, these qual-
ities are physical and have no spiri-
rual significance. For "Spring," it is 
the equivalent of writing Ollt a sutra 
10,000 times but not ever under-
standing the meaning behind it. 

In one of the last scenes of the 
film, the mature monk arduously 
climbs a precipitous mountain and, 
upon arriving at the peak, seesJusan 
Pond in full relief. discovering the 
transcendental. Kim should follow 
his own advice for his next film: 
Take a step back, reassess, and 
abstain from any tllDgential, Van 
Danune-inspired moments.

"The World At Large" 

has beauty to spare, but it's a 
slight rehash of Spiritualized 
and Mercury Rev (possibly 
due to the presence of 
Mercury Rev's producer 
David Fridman). However, it 
leads into the gorgeous "Float

defective Orgy tune stuck 
in a laclduster, redundant 
cycle. Scream-friendly "Ted

cessful mixture of preten-
tious nii-metal with punk 
attitude. 

The album offers a few 
melodic perks and savory 
insertions of extra instru-
ments such as the cello and 
the accordion. Yet, every 
alluring melody is countered 
by a particularly irksome 
mixture of human sounds 
and monotonous beats, and 
after the first couple of 
songs, the rest of the album 
remains unchangingly hum-
drum.

The warped, hom-laden 
folk of "The Devil '5 
Workplace" conjures Tom 
Waits at his scary best, and 
"The View" is a fine entry 
into the disco-punk trend. 
Throughout, Isaac Brock's 
howling voice spews hit-or-
miss lines that unexpectedly 
stick with you: "It's true we 
named our children after 
towns that we'd never been

guitar effects and vintage 
instrumentation they're

create something that is cere-
bral yet accessi ble.

'Clifford': Straigbt-to-video trash 
or psychological experience? 

By BRIAN UIGA 
Staff Writer 

'C lifford's Really Big Movie" isn't actu-
ally a really big movie in any respect, 
more of an extra-long episode of the 
sleepy TV series about a red dog 

whose height varies between 20 feet and 
four stories tall. But, the point is he's big, 
he's red, and he's voiced by the now-
deceased John Riner. 

The plot of "Clifford" is wafer-thin, 
something about food and an odd 3-D CGI 
circus transcribed on top of the very wispy 
2-D drawings, but during the 45 seconds in 
which these events are explained one may 
be easily distracted by the several hundred 
shrieking children voicing their numerous 
objections to the film. 

After all, "Clifford's Really Big Movie" 
is a Really Comfortable Movie. Targeting 
an audience of teething toddlers and their 
unfortunate guardians, the film's sole overt 
purpose is to calm both parties so that 
their murual relief will form an integral 
part of the Clifford franchising cycle (the 
next step, being the acquisition of the 
DVD, followed by the three novellas and 
stuffed animals). 

Yet, lurking beneath this happy exterior, 
"Clifford" hides one of cinema's greatest 
ironies. Rosebud was only a sled in "Citizen 
Kane." HAL 9000 was more human than 
the human drones in "200 I: A Space 
Odyssesy." And, the calming effect of 
"Clifford" will not only completely fail in its 
perceived goal of child pacification, but will 
instead actively antagonize these children, 
forcing all viewing parties involved to con-
sider man's mortality. The proof is in the 
audience. Instead of hearing coos of delight 
upon viewing semi-epic pastel landscapes, 
or sighs of relief as the ending conflict 
(involving an autograph gone awry) is dis-
solved in the greatest deus ex machina since 
"Star Wars Episode II," the audience is 
instead treated to screams of recognition 

Q Film ~~f----REV-IEW= 
and joy as the children understand what 
they are seeing. 

Yes, the children understand this film, 
and they understand the logic involved in 
this film. They understand that business-
men armed with binding contracts will 
spontaneously rip them up when confront-
ed with the "right thing to do," and this 
information is stored away in their develop-
ing brains for all eternity. 

And this facet is where "Clifford's Really 
Big Movie" transcends all that has come 
before and proves itself as a unique new 
cinematic experience. For the full effect of 
"Clifford's Really Big Movie" will not be 
seen for another 20 years, when a genera-
tion of indoctrinated toddlers approach the 
business world with the cheery, optimistic 
outlook offered by the movie's portrayal of 
family values and ethical busine s practices. 
And, when this generation approaches with 
twinlcling eyes, it will fall subservient to the 
untainted children of the movie 's filmmak-
ers and distributors. 

Is "Clifford's Really Big Movie" a tool for 
massive global economic change? It is not a 
question of if, but when. DVD sales figure 
heavily into the overall effect, and whether or 
not "optional extras" are included with 
"Clifford" DVDs may spell the difference 
between opulence and poverty for millions of 
Americans. Billions if there's a sing-along.

Rugby: Tritons slip, fall after close first half 
carWnI4ed from fJO«t '0 

and try to move the ball to the 
weak side, so that the defense 
would be drawn that way after a 
series of offensive attacks. 

"We have a few sequences that 
go to one side to draw their defense 
that way; Hanos said. "Then we 
atUck from the opposite side." 

The strategy proved a success as 
UCSD continued to pound away at 
the shallow and weakening UNC 
defense, scoring the majority of the 
team's 32 points on outside tries 
that moved around the Bears' 
defense. 

"We scored a lot on the outside 
when we were able to get the ban 
up the wings," Hanos said. 

The Tritons were unable to cap-
italize on several conversion 
attempts (points after a successful 
try) as a result of the dismal weath-
er in University Park. 

"[April 17) was a super-windy 
day, so conversions were difficult," 
Hanos said. 

With the win, the Tritons were 

matched up to play the NitUny 
Lions on April 18, who were fresh 
from defeating Stanford on April 
17. This is considered an 
extremely short rest period in 
such an intensely physical game. 

"We didn't play our best," 
junior hooker Jenny Triplett said. 
"The last time we played Penn 
State, in September, we tied, but 
they came out stronger than 
ever." 

UCSD played with the NitUny 
Lions through the first half, allow-
ing only one try and the conver-
sion, for a 7 -0 halftime deficit. But 
after battling close, the Triton line 
defense began to fold. 

"Our defense is a horizontal 
line of IS players across the field, 
but is only one deep," Triplett 
said. "If the offense can find a 
hole and get through, then outrun 
our defense, they pretty much 
have a try." 

Penn State scored early in the 
second 4O-minute half, but the 
Tritons were unable to bring their 

defense back together as cohesively 
as they would have liked. 

"We're not used to having to 
regroup," Triplett said. "We pretty 
much spanIc our opponents all sea-
son long, so it was unusual to have 
to regroup that much." 

The increased level of contact 
in the match contributed to the dif-
ficulties of the second half. 

"It was a pretty physical game," 
Hartos said. "We were pretty beat 
up and just didn't have the same 
depth [as Penn State]." 

"The style of play [on April 18] 
was entirely different than the rest 
of the year," sophomore prop 
Jillian Duggan said. "We just 
weren't getting some of the calls 
that we are used to getting in our 
favor, which made the Penn State 
offense virtuaUy impossible for us 
to defend." 

The Tritons finish the 2004 sea-
son at No. 5 in the national 
Division I rankings, and are look-
ing forward to another prosperous 
showing in 2005. 

COUI8f of ucso MHetic:s 
Pushi"l the 1M: The Tritons' line defense, which proved effective throughout the regular season, fell through in the April 
16 match against the Nittany Lions of Penn State. 

Tennis: UCSD doubles sweep Highlanders 
coruinueJ from ". 15 

overall record of 17 -9 and are set 
to head into the playoffs. 
Meanwhile, the Highlanders 
dropped to 1-18 on the season. 

"It feels good to end the season 
on a win streak," senior Amir 
Neiad said. "Right now, everyone's 
confidence is high." 

UCSD maintained its steady 
play in doubles by sweeping the 
Highlanders, 3-0, to gain the dou-
bles point for the day. At No. I 
doubles, junior Bryan Swatt and 
Nejad teamed up to heat Nonnan 
Tam and Brent Davis, 8-6. At No. 
2, senior Nick Morton and sopho-
more Brent Molden defeated 
Riancarlo Cava and Jordan Leo, 8-
6. 

Senior Sameer Chopra, who 
usually plays No. I doubles with 
Wilson, did not play and junior 

Emil Novak stepped in Chopra's 
shoes to play doubles with Wilson. 
The duo finished UCSD's doubles 
sweep with a convincing 8-3 victo-
ry against Jeremy Owens and 
Caesar Regaliza. 

"It was really fun playing with 
Emil [Novak]," Wilson said. "We 
were a returning force and only let 
them hold serve twice and broke 
their serve the resJ; of the match." 

In singles, UCSD took four out 
of the six matches to secure the 
team victory, its fourth win against 
a Division I team. At No.2 singles, 
Wilson won 6-4,7-5, in his match, 
handing Davis his second loss of 
the day. Novak got past Leo in 
straight sets, 7-5, 6-4, at No.3 sin-
gles. Molden and Morton also 
snagged a victory in straight sets 
with scores of 6-2, 7-6 and 6-0,6-
0, respectively. 

Senior Sean Higginbotham, 
who is currendy sidelined with an 
injury, played assistant coach for 
the day, watching Wilson's singles 
match. 

"I got off to a bad start because 
I was a little bit weak from playing 
so many matches," Wilson said. 
"But Sean [Higginbotham]'s sooth-
ing words and expert guidance 
helped me win. He told me what 
shots to go for." 

UCSD's two losses in singles 
were at No. I, where Tam defeated 
Swatt, 6-4, 7-5, and at No.5, 
where Regaliza defeated Nejad, 2-
6,7-5, 10-7. 

The Tritons have secured a 
playoff spot and are currently 
awaiting specific times and 
matchups for the NCAA Division 
II Regionals, which will be held 
May 7 through May 9.

Women's crew takes 
third at City Regatta 

Rough waters and weary 
rowers lead to difficulties 
By MICHAEL SCHOECK 

Senior Staff Writer 
The UCSD women's crew team 

performed well in the annual San 
Diego City Championships on 
April 17, competing against cross-
town rivals San Diego State 
University and University of San 
Diego. 

" 

was UCSDs intended race pace. 
Although this was a strong ini-

tial performance, the team gradual-
ly began to decelerate in the face of 
increasingly unfavorable racing 
conditions, falling noticeably 
behind San Diego State and USD. 

"Unfortunately, we weren't able 
to hold that intensity for the entire 

race. The crew felt 
With UCSD 

battling an incom-
ing tide, the 
women's varsity 
eight finished third 
with a time of 7 
minuteJi, 37.43 sec-
onds in the first 
race of the day. 

"I was very 
pleased wi th the 
varsity eight's race 

We learned from this 
race I and we know 
that we have to go 

all out I all the 

they lost the spark 
as the other crews

we finished further 
back than I would

said.

coach Pattie Pinkerton said. 

Though the Tritons fared well 
against both SDSU and USD, the 
rough rowing conditions proved 
problematic and aggravating, 
which hurt the consistency of the 
team's performance. 

The varsity eight boat came off 
the starting line at a strong 42 
strokes-per-minute, staying with 
USD and San Diego State for the 
first 1,200 meters of the race. 

For the majority of the race, the 
UCSD varsity eight boat held a rat-

we have nearly nailed down the

said. "We learned from this race,

Senior first baseman Jodie

three more with a jack to right 
field, her fourth home run of the 
season, furthering the Tritons' lead 
in homeruns in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association. 

Meurer came up big again in 
the fifth, with a two-RBI double, 
bringing her RBI season total to 
five, while going 2-for-3 on the 
day. Senior second baseman Kim 
Aggabao, who entered the day 
leading the CCAA in hitting,

Baseball drops final game at SFSU 
Tritons split series against Gators, remain tied in conference 

By COUIINEY FIELD 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD and San Francisco 
State University completed a 
four-game series on April 18 at 
Maloney Field in San Francisco 
with a 4-1 victory for the Gators. 
The teams split the series and 
remain tied in California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
conference play with 17-15 
records. 

In the final game of the series, 
UCSD jumped out to a 1-0 lead 
in the top of the second inning as 
junior first baseman Brian 
Robinson singled up the middle 
before advancing to second base 
when the next batter, sophomore 
rightfielder Damian Fante, was 
hit by a pitch. Robinson came

around to score on a single to 
center field by junior designated 
hitter Joel Clark, giving the 
Tritons the only run they would 
earn all dlY. 

"Because both teams pitched 
so well, the series came down to 
timely hitting and execution," 
UCSD head coach Dan O'Brien 
said. "We weren't consistent in 
those areas and ended up split-
ting a series that I thought we 
could have swept. On the bright 
side, a series like that helps us 
prepare for the challenging post-
season, if we earn that opportu-
nity." 

The Gators put up one run in 
the bottom of both the fourth and 
fifth innings. San Francisco State 
scored two more runs in the bot-
tom of the eighth to secure the 

11 .' .4- . 4 •• 

victory over the Tritons. 
UCSD's Fante was the only 

player on either team with more 
than one hit, going 2-for-3 on the 
day. 

Senior surting pitcher Rafael 
Bergstrom took the loss for the 
Tritons, despite allowing only two 
runs on three hits in five innings. 
He fell to 4-6 on the season. 
Junior pitcher Shlomo Lipetz 
closed out the game for UCSD, 
allowing only one hit in his one 
inning of work. 

For the Gators, starter Chris 
Brown picked up the win and 
improved to 7 -1 on the season 
after tossing seven full innings 
on the mound, in which he 
allowed only one run on three 
hits and one walk with three 
strikeouts. 

Reliever Ben Clayton threw 
one and one-third innings of 
hitless relief before handing the 
ball to Gator closer Keith 
Albright in the ninth inning. 
Albright picked up his sixth save 
of the season for San Francisco 
State after striking out the final 
two Triton batters of the game. 

The Tritons return to San 
Diego for a five-game homestand 
April 23 through April 28 in a 
four-game series against CCAA 
powerhouse Chico State, then a 
single matchup against Vanguard 
University. The series begins on 
April 23 at 2:30 p.m. at Triton 
Baseball Stadium. 

The April 24 Chico State 
doubleheader is scheduled for 
noon, as is the series finale on 
April 25. UCSD takes the field 
against Vanguard at 3 p.m. on 
April 28 in the Triton home 
finale.

have made a lot of progress and 
had some great things happen, 
but no one is truly satisfied yet," 
junior Brian Duckworth said. 
.. After every tournament, we are 
thinking what could have been if 
just a few breaks would have 
gone our way." 

Cal State Bakersfield emerged 
as the CCAA champion for the 
third consecutive year. 
Bakersfield shot rounds of 294, 
288 and 286, to finish at 868, 
four over par. 

Chico State came in second, 
turning in rounds of 295,293 and 
294, giving it a total of 882, 18 
over. Cal State Stanislaus, finished 
third. With rounds of 303, 300 
and 290, Cal State Stanislaus 
earned an 893, 29 over par. 

Individually, UCSD was led 
by ace Duckworth, who tied for 
10th place overall. Duckworth 
just missed making the 2004 AlI-
CCAA Team, awarded to the 
top-eight finishers. He shot 
rounds of 77 and 78 on April 19, 
but came baele on April 20 to 
shoot a 69, the second-lowest 
score of the day, for a total of 
224, eight over par. 

"Brian had an excellent final 
round on [April 19)," Wydra said. 

Senior team captain Alan 
Scheer was hot on Duckworth's 
tail, missing him by one stroke for 
a 225. Scheer, with rounds of 79, 
73 and 73, tied for 12th place 
overall. 

"Alan [Scheer 1 had a great 
round going on April 20, and 

shot a 73, even with a triple 
bogey on the last hole. He is 
playing really strong right now," 
Wydra said. 

Junior Joe Dolby rounded out 
the squad's big three, tying for 
17thplacewitha227, 11 over par. 
Dolby turned in rounds of 71, 78 
and 78. 

"Joe [Dolby) is always reliable 
for us," Wydra said. 

Sophomore Ryo Yamada took 
fourth for UCSD and 20th over-
all. With rounds of 78, 74 and 76, 
Yamada finished with a 228, 12 
over. 

"Ryo [Yamada) is really coming 
into his own now," Wydra said. 

Sophomore Robbie Kramer 
completed UCSD'5 squad, end-
ing up in 32nd place overall. 
Kramer had round totals of 81, 
80 and 79, giving him a 240, 24 
over par. 

"We changed our lineup a little 
- and our top four are very solid 
- but we're still looking for our 
fifth man, and I'm confident we'U

7:08.27. San Diego State was in 
second place, crossing the line 
in 7: 11.50. 

"'Ibis regatta is always a 
tough one for us ... the differ-
ence for [UCSD) is that we are 
scholar athletes racing against 
scholarship athletes," Pinkerton 
said. 

The women's junior varsity 
eight crossed the line in a time 
of 7:53.34, also finishing third, 
while the women's lightweight 
eight finished second with a 
time of8:19.12 . 

"The junior varsity eight 
also raced well, finishing within 
20 seconds of the other schools, 
closer than we did a few weeks 
ago at the [March 27 Newport 
Harbor) Berg Cup," Pinkerton 
said. 

UCSD's difficult early 
morning workouts have certain-
ly paid off. 

In the most recent 
Collegiate Rowing Coaches 
AssociationlU.S. Rowing polls, 
UCSD ranked second among 
Division n competitors. 

"We trained through the 
regatta, with our eye on the 
Western Intercollegiate Rowing 
[Association) Championships in 
two weeks," Pinkenon said. 

Rather than training in antic-
ipation of an easy victory against 
its vay strong competition, the 
team has been focused on prepu-
in for the approaching WIRA ~pionships, and is expecting 
further improvement in its future 
meets. 

"Our times should improve 
over the next race against 
Chapman and UC Santa 
Barbara," senior Jennifer 
Watrers said. 

Although Division I UCSB 
beat UCSD at the Berg Cup in 
March, the Tritons, with the 
home advantage and several 
athletes graduating, would like 
to finish with a victory. 

The meet will mark the final 
home race for a large number of 
women's crew veterans, includ-
ing senior four-year rowers 
Stefanic Barriere, Liz Jones, 
Kleckner, Watters and 
Romelfanger. 

UCSD returns to action on 
April 24, taking on Chapman 
and UCSB in Mission Bay.

Pair of wins extends win streak to six 
Five-run first inning eliminates Toros early 

By JOE SPANO 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD softball team 
extended its winning streak to six 
games by defeating Cal State 
Dominguez Hills in a double-

header on April 18. The games, 
which took place on Senior Day, 
were originally scheduled for 
April 17, but were postponed due 
to rain. 

Freshman starter Tina Rowe 
barely needed any late-inning 

offensive support, as she received 
several early runs in the game, 
which ended in a 9-3 Triton victo-
ry. Rowe hurled a complete game, 
giving up three earned runs and

Women's team completes 2003-2004 season ranked No.5 nationally 
By MAnttEW GIANT 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD women's rugby 
team traveled to Pennsylvanja 
April 17 and April 18 to compete 
in the opening rounds of the USA 
Rugby Division I Sweet 16 
National Tournament at the Penn 

State Flower Gardens. The 
Tritons entered the event seeded 
No.4, after earning the No.1 spot 
in the Southern California region 
in the regular season. UCSD 
defeated No. 13 University of 
Nonhern Colorado on April 17 in 
an exhilarating 32-6 rout, but was 
defeated in a crushing 43-7 loss to 

No. 12 Penn State on April 18 at 
the Nittany Ljons' home field. 

Junior fly-half captain Kirstin 
Hartos spoke sympathetically of 
Nonhern Colorado team's perfor-
mance on April 17. 

"It was their first time at 
Nationals," Hartos said. "The 
serum-half and fly-half were good, 

but their forward pack was pretty 
small, and I think their best player 
was missing." 

The Tritons came onto the 
field prepared to play with the 
nation's top opponents. The game 
plan was to set up for the overloa~

leads Tritons 
with 10th 

place finish 
By JOE SPANO 
Senior Staff Writer 

Facing the toughest competition 
Division II golf has to offer, UCSD 
placed fourth out of eight teams at 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association Championship, held on 
April 19 and April 20 at Diablo 
Grande, in Patterson, Calif. 

"The course was very difficult, 
and we had some bad weather. 
Instead of being bright and SUIUlY, 
as it was down here, it was cold and 
rainy up there," head coach Mike 
Wydra said. "This made seoring 
difficult - at least for evetyone 
besides [the individual champion, 
Cal State Bakersfield's) D.). 
Fernando." 

The Tritons completed their 
first round on April 19 with a seore 
of 305, putting them in fourth 
place, where they would remain for 
the rest of the tournament. In the 
afternoon round, UCSD again 
topped the 300 mark with 303, but 
improved seven strokes on April 20 
to end with a 296, for a total of 904, 
40 over par.

be summed up as saying that we
