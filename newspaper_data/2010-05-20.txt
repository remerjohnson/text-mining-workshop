Following a heated public clash between a prominent pro-Israel activist and a member 
of the Muslim Student Association, 
representatives from Tritons for Israel 
began meeting with sponsors of the 

annual Justice in Palestine Week — 
an MSA-sponsored event that pres-
ents students with information about 
Israel’s alleged war crimes in the 
occupied Palestinian territories — to 
persuade them to rethink funding an 
event that they perceive as hurtful.

“It’s not necessarily discourage-
ment as much as [telling depart-
ments to] have a discussion with 
this organization before sponsoring 
these organizations, and asking them, 
‘Well, what are you going to do at this 
event? What kind of speakers are you 

bringing? What are their points of 
view?’” Tritons for Israel President 
Dafna Barzilay said. “They can have 
this week; it’s just that the way it’s 
done right now is hurting our com-
munity.”

Newly elected MSA President 
Sarmad Bokhari said that such a 
retraction of funds would limit the 
organization’s free-speech rights.

 “One of our biggest concerns is 
that there is big pressure on UCSD 
administration and the MSA to 
censor its discussion on conflict,” 

Bokhari said. “Any discussion on the 
apartheid  — on the uncondition-
al support of the United States for 
the Israeli government — is literally 
being censored on university cam-
puses, and being done so by lobby 
groups such as [the American Israel 
Public Affairs Committee].”

Tensions came to a head on May 
10, when the Young Americans for 
Freedom invited radical pro-Israel 
commentator David Horowitz to 

Pro-Israel students speak 
out against funding for 
Justice in Palestine Week.

Green Center
Opens Doors 
to Students

Members of the Student Sustainability 
Collective celebrated their official move-in to 
the new Sustainability Resource Center in Price 
Center on May 17, after finalizing the terms of a 
legal document that allows them to share space 
with university staff. 

The SRC was designed to be an informational 
center where students can learn about sustain-
ability careers and eco-friendly products. It was 
funded by the university and private donors, 
and opened its doors last November. However, 
after being verbally promised shared usage of 
the center by administrators, SSC members were 
initially denied open access when it opened last 
November. 

They were mostly at odds with Campus 
Sustainability Coordinator Maggie Souder, whose 
office is housed in the center. The two parties 
could not agree on the terms of a Memorandum 
of Understanding, which would act as a legal 
document to officially establish the terms of the 
shared space. Without it, students were legally 
denied the ability to co-manage the SRC.

In a January 21 Guardian article, both Souder 
and one of the six SSC student directors, Rishi 
Ghosh, said the MOU drafting process was 
impeded because SSC members clashed with 
Souder over how much access each party would 
receive. 

“In the details is where it falls through,” Souder 
told the Guardian reporter.

As a result, students and staff met throughout 
Winter and Spring Quarters to draft a MOU that 
served both their interests.

“With the MOU, we had a few rough spots, 
but we basically increased the frequency of our 
meetings to the point where we were meeting at 
one point 10 hours a week almost,” Ghosh said.

Members recruited the help of Vice Chancellor

T he University of California will redirect $500 million from administrative services 
into academic sectors within five 
years, finance experts announced dur-
ing the May 19 UC Board of Regents 
meeting in UC San Francisco. 

According to UC Chief Financial Officer Peter Taylor, 
the reallocation is part of an ongoing initiative to restructure 
the UC budget so that it reduces wasteful spending and puts 
emphasis on academics. Since 2008, the university has redi-
rected $232 million from areas such as risk management and 
insurance into academic affairs. 

Taylor said the changes are based on a series of UC Office 
of the President efficiency reports detailing how to streamline 
university spending. Currently, there is no set of standard crite-
ria by which administrative sectors throughout the UC system 
will be restructured, but Taylor said he hopes to reduce “pro-
curement,” or the acquisition of items such as office supplies. 

“We spend $4 billion a year on everything from pens to 
calculators to fancy printer paper,” he said. “By deploying

resources from that area, a conservative 
estimate says that we can save $100 mil-
lion without cutting jobs.”

Taylor said this kind of consolida-
tion would preserve the academic inde-
pendence of the campuses while reduc-
ing the need for each campus to have 
an autonomous administrative sector.

“We’re a university that values 
autonomy and independence on the 
academic level, and the academics are 
what we’re known for,” Taylor said. “But 
we don’t necessarily need autonomy 
and independence in the administra-
tive level. I have a definite bias for sys-
tem administration to be centralized.” 

Under the plan, the overall amount 
of campus funding allocated to each 
campus would not change. Taylor said 
that each campus has a block of fund-
ing that remains constant; savings will 
be made by shifting funds from admin-
istrative sectors into academic affairs 
instead. 

“UCOP won’t be the command-
and-control central of where this 
money goes,” Taylor said. “That’s the 
chancellor’s decision of which academ-
ic sector to put the extra money, —
whether it be another poli-sci instruc-
tor or a biology researcher.”

Another reallocation effort will be 
consolidating human-resource centers. 
Although each campus will still have its 
own center, this plan would synchro-
nize the various HR computer systems 
into a single database. 

“If there’s someone in HR working 
at Berkeley and then goes down to UC 
San Diego, the different HR databases 
might not communicate, so he has to 
be added in as an employee again,” 
Taylor said. “That’s a waste of time and 
money, and the kind of thing we want 
to avoid. Same thing with payroll — 

there’s no reason to have 11 when we 
can get the system down to one.”

According to UC Vice President of 
Business Operations Nathan Brostrom, 
the campuses are also considering shar-
ing resources such as medical and data 
centers, as well as centralizing different 
library databases. 

A.S. Vice President of External 
Affairs Michael Lam said it is impor-
tant to centralize student resources 
rather than cut them completely.

“I haven’t looked fully into it, but 
from what I know, they should be care-
ful,” Lam said. “Student centers are here 
for a reason, and students use these 
resources to help them with academics, 
so we shouldn’t be cutting.”

Taylor said he is unsure whether the 
restructuring effort would include lay-
offs. He said there are currently 118,000 
full-time administrative employees in 
the UC system — which includes a 
turnover of approximately 10,000 who 
leave each year, often due to retirement 
or transfer to other jobs. 

“It’s hard to say if jobs will be cut, 
and we don’t have specific numbers 
yet,” Taylor said. ‘“We’re not embarking 
on this to whack jobs from the UC, but 
I can’t say that they won’t. But maybe 
if we redeploy these people, it’ll be a 
smarter use of the administration.”

Taylor’s proposal was well-received 
by UC Board of Regents Chair Russell 
Gould, who said the restructuring 
effort would be a high priority. 

“We need [the regents’] support for 
this, and I think we got that today,” 
Taylor said. 

Taylor will present a timeline for 
the implementation of these programs 
at the next regents meeting on July 13.

speak at Price Center. He arrived in 
the middle of the MSA’s Justice in 
Palestine Week — which included a 
Library Walk recreation of the Israeli 
security wall that separates Israel 
from the West Bank.

During Horowitz’ presentation, he 
began a rapid-fire debate 
with UCSD student and 
MSA member Jumanah 
Imad Albahri, who asked 
him to back up his claim 
that Muslim student 
organizations in the U.S. 
are funded by terrorists. 
The debate peaked when 
Horowitz asked Albahri 
to definitively condemn 
or support Hezbollah — a 
government that the U.S. 
classified as a terrorist 
organization in 1999.

“The head of 
Hezbollah has said that 
he hopes that we will gather in Israel 
so he doesn’t have to hunt us down 
globally. [Are you] for it or against it?” 
Horowitz asked.

“For it,” Albahri said.
Albahri declined to comment fur-

ther, but said in an online statement 
that she originally misunderstood the 
question.

“My answer, ‘for it,’ in the context in 
which it was said, does not mean ‘for’ 
genocide,” Albahri said in the state-
ment. “I was referring to his initial 
question that asked me for my position 
on Hamas, a topic that — for his own 
political reasons — he was relentless 
in pursuing. ‘For it’ was not a legiti-
mization of Hezbollah’s — or anyone 
else’s credo for that matter — that Jews 
should be exterminated.”

Hezbollah and Hamas are both 

Palestinian paramilitary govern-
ments within the disputed territo-
ries of Lebanon and the Gaza Strip, 
respectively. The organizations receive 
significant popular support from the 
Palestinian people, partly because they 
provide social services like schools and 
hospitals. However, their sponsorship 

of violent attacks against 
Israeli citizens — as well as 
official statements they’ve 
released condemning 
Zionism and denying the 
Holocaust — have made 
them controversial.

Young Americans for 
Freedom chairwoman 
Gabriella Hoffman called 
Albahri’s comment threat-
ening and anti-Semitic.

“Being Jewish, it’s hurt-
ful that someone in my 
university would want to 
kill me, my friends that I 
associate with, the faculty 
— a lot of the community 

[at UCSD] is Jewish,” Hoffman said.
However, students on both sides 

of the debate have said that, given the 
context of her debate with Horowitz, 
Albahri likely did not intend to con-
done genocide.

“I don’t know her personally,” 
MSA member Leena Barakat said. 
“But as an active member of the 
MSA, I don’t actually believe that 
this is what she actually condoned... 
because it goes so far against the 
beliefs and practices and teachings 
of Islam. She’s anti-Zionist, she’s pro-
Jewish. She isn’t anti-Jewish at all.”

Bokhari said that a video posted 
of Albahri’s comment was mislead-
ing.

of Resource Management and Planning 
Gary Matthews and Assistant Vice 
Chancellor Russell Thackston to help 
expedite the process.

“When we realized discussions 
weren’t going anywhere, we called 
in help,” SSC student director 
Elizabeth Elman said. “[Matthews 
and Thackston] were very willing to 
listen to our concerns and help us 
negotiate with the staff — which, in 
my opinion, was the critical concern 
holding us back.”

When discussions came to a halt in 
late January, SSC members threatened 
Souder that they would take the case to 
University Centers administrators — 
who have the power to alter the terms 
of the SRC — as a negotiating tool.

“None of those escalation tactics 
were necessary, because we were ulti-
mately able to work it out among our-
selves,” Ghosh said.

Staff and students finalized 
the MOU last week, then sent it to 
Thackston and A.S. President Wafa 
Ben Hassine for final approval. Ghosh 
said he expects the document to be 
approved within two weeks.

According to the drafted MOU, stu-
dents will manage half the SRC’s floor 
space — including the lounge area, 
which will also function as student 
office space. SSC members will also 
now be allowed to use the center’s stor-
age space for materials such as infor-
mational pamphlets.

The six SSC student directors have 
additionally been granted full-time 

access by way of a fingerprint scanner 
at the center’s entrance. Before, stu-
dents were only permitted to enter the 
space when Souder was present.

Lastly, the MOU grants SSC mem-
bers the ability to schedule projects and 
meetings in the SRC without request-
ing approval from Souder in advance.

Ghosh and Souder both said sepa-
rately that the agreement is a step for-
ward for campus sustainability.

“It was great to see the happiness 
and enthusiasm that was apparent at 
Monday’s move-in celebration,” Souder 
said. “The collaboration occurring in 
the space continues to shape UC San 
Diego’s sustainability future.”

Tonight’s two-hour A.S. Council meeting kicked off with a short discussion about 
the pros and cons of the various 
trolley lines proposed by the city of 
San Diego, planned for completion 
in 2016. A.S. Enterprises Advisory 
Intern and former Campuswide 

Senator Tobias Haglund then 
presented a list of potential names 
for the newly 
approved A.S. 
Store, which 
will be located 
in Price Center 
and sell Greek 
merchandise. 
Suggestions 
included “Black Pearl” and 
“Maelstrom Dome,” although 
Haglund said he was unsure what 
“Maelstrom” meant (one council-
member defined it for him as a 
“violent storm”). Haglund said that 
the store, which councilmembers 
originally hoped would open in Fall 
Quarter 2010, would more likely 
make its debut next Winter Quarter. 

During public input, Muslim 
Student Association President 
Sarmad Bokhari spoke about a 
recent incident in which a Muslim 
student — when prodded by pro-
Israel speaker David Horowitz — 
implied that she supported a second 
Jewish genocide. According to 
Bokhari, the student, Jumanah Imad 
Albahri, is not and has never been 
an elected representative of the MSA, 
and her views do not represent that 
of the organization. 

Vice President of Finance and 
Resources Andrew Ang announced 
that he would be submitting associate 
vice president nominations to New 
Business next week. 

Transfer Senator and 
Transportation Policy Committee 
member Adam Powers gave a 

lengthy presentation recapping the 
Transportation Referendum — a 
fee that would go toward preserving 
buses and shuttles on campus that 
was proposed in Fall Quarter, then 
failed Winter Quarter on the recom-
mendation of the A.S. Transportation 
Committee. 

“The options were ‘Pass this refer-
endum or we’ll cut shuttles,’ and that 

was a little too 
‘A or B’ for us,” 
Powers said. “I 
think we need to 
cut ties to them.”

The next 
meeting of the 
Transportation 

Policy Committee, who will ulti-
mately decide the effect of the failed 
referendum on campus shuttles, will 
be Monday, May 24 from noon to 1 
p.m. in the Price Center West Bear 
Room. 

The council then approved A.S. 
President Wafa Ben Hassine’s nomi-
nation of Muir College freshman 
Elizabeth Garcia as her chief of staff. 

Sixth College Senator Parminder 
Sandhu said that further meetings 
of the Electronic Policy Committee 
had been cancelled, as “the university 
librarian says there’s not enough to 
discuss.” 

Ben Hassine reminded everyone 
that the official 2010-11 executive 
budget would be proposed at next 
week’s meeting. 

“This will be a short meeting,” she 
said, amid skeptical laughter from 
councilmembers. She reminded them 
of a new process in which only the 
most pressing issues will be passed, 
and the rest of the budget will wait 
until Week Three of Fall Quarter.

“Take my personal guarantee that 
this will be a shorter meeting,” she 
said. “It’s the fall meeting that will be 
the longer meeting.”

“That video is being exploited or 

being used to manipulate her words, 
because she did not mean to say the 
words that she did,” Bokhari said.

TFI President Barzilay said she 
understands the pressure that Albahri 
was under during her debate with 
Horowitz, but that the statement was 
nonetheless unacceptable.

“[We are] understanding that she’s 
human, and that she was forced,” 
Barzilay said. “Based on the speech 
and how extreme he was, it wasn’t very 
effective the way he asked her. But it 
proves these views exist. It proves that 
racist views that happened during the 
‘Compton Cookout’ still exist.”

The main focus of Justice in 
Palestine Week was the wall — repre-
senting the 400-mile West Bank bar-
rier — that stretched down Library 
Walk, displaying facts, maps and 
personal accounts supporting the 
Palestinian cause. MSA representa-
tives said the wall was also meant 
to promote awareness of the Israeli 

government’s alleged human rights 
violations in Gaza and the West Bank.

Some pro-Israel students reacted 
negatively to the wall, which they said 
contained exaggerations and false 
information.

“The [West Bank barrier] is to bar-
ricade any danger coming into those 
areas, so people can live peacefully,” 
Hoffman said. “To present it as apart-
heid is just wrong and misconstrued 
— it’s not the truth.”

Students with TFI have met with 
Justice in Palestine Week sponsors to 
ask that they cease their support, on 
the grounds that it negatively targets 
their community.

The MSA received the majority 
of its funding for Justice in Palestine 
Week from the A.S. Council, with 
additional sources like Thurgood 
Marshall College, the ethnic-stud-
ies department and the Black Staff 
Association.

“It’s just progressed; the level of 
feeling alienated and uncomfortable 
has increased,” Barzilay said. “I do 

feel threatened in some respect on 
campus. I’m a Marshall College stu-
dent; to know that they sponsored the 
events that for a whole week made me 
feel uncomfortable walking on Library 
Walk — it hurts me.”

Bokhari said the week-long event 
was not meant to target or alienate the 
pro-Israel students on campus; rather, 
he said, the goal was to raise aware-
ness about the human rights violations 
the Israeli government has committed 
against the Palestinians living in the 
occupied territories.

“This week, this cause, is not 
Muslim versus Jews; it’s not anti-Sem-
itism, but rather anti-Zionism — the 
idea of an exclusive Jewish state in 
Palestine,” Bokhari said. “The main 
purpose of the event is to raise aware-
ness and to let college students know 
what the Palestinian narrative actu-
ally is, because they won’t hear it from 
mainstream, regular media.”

Props to the Loft for its new “Be Lofty” initiative, which gives 
students the option to pay $25 for a yearlong all-access event 
pass. But ﬂops for giving it a stupid name.

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG/OPINIONTHURSDAY, MAY 20, 2010

In my 21-year career as a TV watcher, I can only vividly recall one commercial: the one where 
Sarah McLachlan’s saintly “Angel” 
hymn pervades the room, and my 
glowing screen is filled with a scrunch 
of brown fuzz, complete with round 
eyes, a soft button snout and a floppy 
pink tongue. I love puppy.

But something’s wrong: It seems 
he’s lying on a vet’s icy examination 
table, looking sick and vulnerable as 
all hell. I wonder if he’s OK. He stares 
back helplessly as my heartstrings 
tighten. Just when they’ve wound 
so devastatingly tense that I’m 
beginning to emote out loud, the 
helpless McKitty FurFace takes the 
stage and the cycle starts all over 
again. It follows McLachlan’s somber 
piano until she asks me to donate to 
the British Columbia Society for the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

I jump to find my phone and debit 
card — eager to rescue as many doe-
eyed fur folk as my paycheck permits 
— but I abandon the mission when 
“America’s Next Top Model” returns 
from a commercial break, pushing the 
sad, snuggable stares out of my mind.

Almost gets me every time. 
BCSPCA sure knows how to make a 
tearjerker. But the organization’s key to 
my heart is neither its B-list celebrity 
rep nor its reminder that my helpless 
domestic companions are suffering 
everywhere. More than anything else, 
I am moved by cuteness.

It might just be the most powerful 
marketing tool since sex. The 
scientific side of our reaction to cute is 
that — as a species that births some of 
the most incapable, drooly infants on 
Earth — we are programmed to tend 
to anything that exemplifies even the 
most remote trace of babyish need. In 
fact, our Darwinian instinct runs so 
deep that some studies suggest cute 
things stimulate the same feelings of 
pleasure in the brain aroused by a 
delicious meal, sex or cocaine. 

The ad-market translation: 
Consumers go crazy for adorable 
things. Like babies, we love to bring 
them home, hug and squeeze them 
and show them to all our friends.

I’m not talking about blatant-
sucker buys like those of my stuffed 
animal-obsessed housemate, who 
returns with a new bright-pink, 
floppy-limbed friend each time she 
visits CVS for some toothpaste. I’m 
talking subtle qualities, things as 
unnoticeable as a shoe’s rounded toe 
or a car’s wide-eyed headlights. 

If you want a corporate example, 
take the iPhone — a product many 
millions pine for. Its body is smooth, its 
corners rounded and its face covered 
in colorful, bouncy icons. It makes 
cute noises. You want it to have and to 
hold, to touch and to stroke — and that 
attraction has nothing to do with what 
it can actually do. If it did, then HTC’s 
very capable (but hopelessly banal) 
Droid might actually have an advantage 
over Apple’s iconic gadget.

Maybe we should all keep an 
eye out for this marketing ploy, 
avoiding the endearing gaze of the 
cuter candidate when we’re picking 
products. But then everyone would 
only own ugly things. And I don’t 
care how predictable my desire for the 
darling may be — sometimes it’s the 
superfluous pretty stuff that counts.

I t appears one cage just wasn’t enough for the powers that be at this year’s Sun God Festival. 
After confining the best day of the 
year to RIMAC Field last Friday, 
they decided to erect yet another 
barricade — this time around the 
Dance Tent, where DJ Z-Trip was 
laying down a set for the ages. 
Anyone catch that “Ring of Fire” 
mashup? Hot damn.

According to A.S. Associate Vice 
President of Concerts and Events 
Alex Bramwell, there were still 1,000 
students who wanted to belly up to 
Z-Trip after the tent had reached its 
3,000-person capacity. So he made 
the decision — along with his UC 
Police Department and University 
Events Office cohorts — to block 
out the remaining 1,000 so that the 
crowd wouldn’t become danger-
ous. Then, when the blockade itself 
became dangerous (surprise, sur-
prise), they shooed Z-Trip offstage 
an hour early. (Fat chance Z-Trip, 
or any artist in his circle, will bother 
showing up at our poopy party any-
time in the near future.)

Basically, authorities made the 
only move that would ensure people 
got hurt. If you place all $550,000 
worth of Sun God events in one 
small space and then tell everyone 
they have to stand idle on a cold, 
moonlit field — watching from the 
sidelines as the dance party of the 
year rages on without them — you’re 
going to have some broken ankles on 
your hands. 

The Dance Tent is not the 
same as the Main Stage, where 
back-and-forth shoving can lead 
to lung-crushing quarters and the 
infamous domino effect. It’s the very 
same Dance Tent used at Coachella, 
where everyone walks away fine 
(or as fine as they can be after re-
enacting “Flashdance” on MDMA). 
Hormonal chicks aren’t generally 
straining to reach the stage so they 
can kiss the feet of the main act; in 
fact, ravers tend to leave themselves 
some dancing room. And if stu-
dents felt suffocated during Z-Trip, 
they could have woven their way 
out — that’s what the row of giant 
arc-openings along the sides of the 

tent are for.
The most ironic part is that, by 

confining the festival in the first 
place, coordinators created the 
overcapacity problem themselves. 
Until 2008 — when, in response 
to the chaos of Sun God 2007, all 
booths and day stages were swept 
from around campus into the sti-
fling RIMAC dustpan — wristbands 
didn’t even come close to selling 
out. Officials have cited the higher 
number of health emergencies in 
2007 as the reason for the new caged 
format. However, we’d like to per-
sonally deliver the breaking news 
that, despite all campaigns toward 
sobriety, the same stuff still goes on 
— just behind the closed doors of 
dorms, apartments and offices across 
campus.

From the administrative stand-
point, another main drawback to 
the all-campus format was the mess 
it left behind. Maybe if the A.S. 
Council hadn’t blown $5,000 to 
$6,000 on a Sun God blowup doll 
(redesigned by A.S. graphic artists 
to resemble a disfigured sci-fi insect, 

the perfect muse for their circle-
jerk), and instead paid a janitorial 
staff to clean up after Friday’s cam-
puswide debauchery, we could have 
let off some real steam.

It’s clear the force of youthful fun-
bellion on campus is moot when the 
fearless assholes from student news-
paper the Koala don’t even have the 
balls to set up their annual waterslide 
on Sun God Lawn — the only thing 
the rest of us can agree to like them 
for — due to a few official-looking 
e-mails threatening legal action. 
(Major flops there, gentlemen.) Or 
maybe they were just shamed by that

College radio stations — not unlike extremist newspapers and humanities professors — 
are a more subversive trademark on 
any campus. They often lack adver-
tisements. They’re populated by 
indie vinylphiles. They would rather 
face nuclear warfare than air the lat-
est Miley Cyrus single. 

On this campus, student radio is 
also a hidden Student Center niche. 
However, the managers of KSDT 
have recently expressed new interest 
in spreading their programming to a 
greater population. 

UCSD’s “fiercely independent” 
station is currently only broadcast 
online, but co-manager Meredith 
Wong and executive at large Marcus 
Rosario want to invest in an on-
campus radio tower to finally take 
them on air. 

Due to San Diego’s overcrowded 
airwaves though, Wong said there 
are precious few FM radio frequen-
cies available. Therefore, an AM 
radio station — which would prob-

ably only be broadcast on campus, so 
as to avoid Federal Communications 
Commission restrictions — would 
supposedly be the most feasible 

avenue to get 
on air.

Even if 
we ignore 
the fact that 
the gathering 
’round the 
AM radio for 
community 
entertainment 
is about as 
popular a col-
lege pastime 
as a game of 
(non-strip) 
Candyland, 
it’s estimated 

that an on-campus tower would 
require an initial investment of a 
whopping $100,000 — which would 
be entirely funded by student fees, if 
approved by the A.S. Council.

While every student org has a 

right to its fair share of the A.S. 
Council’s annual $3 million, this is 
an unprecedented chunk of change 
to request. KSDT hasn’t even begun 
to investigate all the obstacles 
implicit in needing the adminis-
tration to sign over a sizable plot 
of land for the tower. (Wong, for 
the record, said that the station is 
“really serious about it, but hasn’t 
started much of the research.” Go 
figure.) 

Before pursuing a six-figure 
investment in antiquated technology, 
Wong and Rosario would be wise to 
look into more cost-effective ways 
to make a name for their station. 
Partnering with dining halls  or on-
campus coffee shops such as Perks 
and Cafe Roma — which could pos-
sibly broadcast the station’s live radio 
stream — would be a much more 
affordable first step toward reaching 
out beyond KSDT’s Student Center 
speakers. 

Though it may sacrifice some of 
the station’s hipster cred, it wouldn’t 

hurt to add a KSDT feature to the 
existing UCSD iPhone application 
for greater visibility. The station 
could even approach our school’s 
own iPhone App Programming 
Club (or other likeminded student 
techies) to develop a live stream-
ing application for mobile devices. 
Doing so could garner a fresh crop 
of listeners while maintaining the 
fierce independence that a govern-
ment-sanctioned AM broadcast 
might compromise. 

For Real Listners, Shoot for an Accessible Wavelength

Despite a budget that pushed the half-million mark, this year’s festival revealed a sad reality:
Even our most resistant rabble-rousers are vulnerable to the administration’s threats. 

While every 
student org 
has a right to 
its share of the 
A.S. Council’s 
annual $3 
million, 
this is an 
unprecedented 
chunk of 
change to 
request.

Dear Editor,
I am writing to express my con-

cern over the new weekly crossword 
puzzle that has been published in 
the Guardian the past two weeks. It 
does not match the high quality of 
the previously published crosswords 
that were probably from the Los 
Angeles Times. In fact, the current 
crossword could be from People 
magazine. 

As co-creator and administra-
tor of The Finer Things Club, an 
organization that sips tea while con-
versing and doing the crossword, 
I ask that you please return to the 
previous crossword, as it is much 
classier. Thank you.

Dear Editor,
As a member of the Muslim 

Student Association (MSA) and an 
attendee of the Horowitz event, I 
wanted to share my opinion regard-
ing the controversial statements of 
another student attendee. Without 
question, the student’s “For it” state-
ment is indubitably out of line with 
the core Islamic values on which 
the MSA stands (Quran 5:32). She 
makes that explicitly clear in her 
personal statement, which can be 
found on www.fortruthforjustice.
wordpress.com.

Nonetheless, there is no place 
on this campus for anti-Semitism. 
As a member of the MSA, I feel the 
organization has taken a powerful 
stance against anti-Semitism dur-

ing our recent Justice in Palestine 
Week. This is evidenced by the 
numerous Jewish students work-
ing alongside MSA members in 
condemning the unjust policies of 
the Israeli government and mili-
tary. Our guests have included Dr. 
Norman Finkelstein and Hedy 
Epstein, both well-known Jewish 
speakers who have immediate con-
nections to the Holocaust. 

It is noteworthy to add that 
the next MSA student who asked 
Horowitz a question at the event 
readily condemned Hamas. The 
MSA itself is clear by condemning 
“all Palestinian factions that have 
rejoiced in the killing of innocent 
Israeli civilians” (www.ucsdmsa.org). 
Thus, to make an effort to cherry-
pick facts so as to tie the MSA to 
anti-Semitism is entirely misleading 
and disingenuous. 

It seems that the Glenn Becks 
and Sean Hannitys of the world are 
eager to paint the entire Muslim 
college population with a single 
brush, but this is obviously far from 
the facts, and entirely inaccurate. 

These Glenns and Seans are 
making a strong effort to detract 
from the real message of the MSA, 
which is to shed light on the injus-
tices taking place in Palestine and to 
encourage activism towards positive 
change.

There Is No Place for 
Anti-Semitism on Campus

mountainous, chest-pumping blowup 
slide the A.S. Council spent $1,000 
to set up on Thursday in the Koala’s 
traditional spot. Student-run radio 
station KSDT, likewise, was coerced 
into holding its Student Center mini-
fest the day prior. Once Friday came 
around, when students referred to 
“Sun God,” it was clear they meant 
the setup on RIMAC — not the entire 
awesome day in general. Unless we 
wanted to get creative, there was sim-
ply nowhere else to go.

So you got us where you wanted 
us, dear student leaders. We showed 
up to your birthday party. And then 
you had the nerve to tell us that, in 
the interest of our own safety, the only 

option at prime rage hour was to listen 
to some shitty Christian-rock band 
you booked on a self-suckling nostal-
gia trip. 

Don’t get us wrong: We had a fuck-
ing blast on Friday. But that’s because 
the Student Center was our (desolate) 
jungle gym, and most of our friends 
without wristbands somehow man-
aged to sneak in unpunished (to both 
the main cage and the mini one).

Even through the mind-altering 
haze, though, two things were glaring-
ly clear: 1) The UCSD administration 
finally won the thumb war against the 
most resistant of its citizens, and 2) 
Our student government is isolated 
and ego-tripping — hard.

To all you Sun God virgins, the 

festival may have looked like a slightly 
lamer — but at least seemingly free — 
version of Coachella. (That is, if the 
Coachella lineup had been reimagined 
by your little sister on a snickerdoodle 
high.) But think about it. Can you 
fathom the kind of fun we could have 
with half a million dollars?

Sun God tradition used to be that, 
for one day, through the unsuspect-
ing canals of our very own eucalyptus 
grove, we the UCSD nerds could 
make it rain. Instead, last Friday, all 
we got was an elbow-wrestle with 
a Staff Pro perv for our deserved 
spot beneath the lasers, topped off 
by a sloppy pickup line from an ex-
“Degrassi” cripple across the field. We 
want our money back.

What would UCSD be without the Non-Sexist Dance? The 
LGBTQIA-friendly campus tradition is a crucial and familiar stress-
reliever — but this time, for the last dance of the year, it’s being 
displaced from Porter’s Pub to Price Center Plaza due to growing 
popularity. The venue change is lame, but it does create some 
grand opportunities: The fountain awaits. So extend your Sun God 
another weekend with a second serving of public debauchery. 
And don’t forget to stick to the jungle theme. (AS)

TONIGHT

B eing the ponderous artist that I am, I feel I possess a collection of deeply philosophical thoughts 
that are in dire need of relinquish-
ing. Though I usually try to express 
them through comics, sometimes the 
uneven balance of sparse words and 
heavy images just isn’t enough to do 
them justice. Good thing I have a 
column.

My most recent ponder takes 
me down memory lane — or, more 
specifically, to that corner of Library 
Walk where a little shack of Japanese 
knickknacks and cell phone acces-
sories stands every other week. I don’t 
make a habit of visiting this shop, but 
sometimes, I find myself in a terrible 
bout of nostalgia that forces me to 
take a peek. You see, I — like a sizable 
handful of other nerds on this campus 
— was one of those kids who grew 
up most identifying with the weird 
Japanese action figures, comics and 
television shows that populated hobby 
shops and the Internet.  

Luckily, these days, I’m strong 
enough to walk past a window display 
of action figures and not experience 
an overwhelming urge to buy them all 
— though all that restraint is probably 
what led me to take a look around the 
shack. What I found most interesting 
this time around weren’t the acces-
sories, but the stacks of anime DVDs 
on display. To my surprise, I recog-
nized every single one — some of 
them dating back two decades. What 
should have been a heartwarming 
observation — that the shows I adored 
growing up are still somehow relevant 
— actually struck me with a pang of 
sadness. I agree that these animes are 
classics to keep around, but where are 
all the new ones?

I grew up in a sort of golden 
age of anime. The shows that typi-
fied my childhood were dense and 
highly sophisticated sociological and 
philosophical commentaries: romantic 
transvestite martial-arts comedies 
laced with bestiality and robot apoca-
lypses, centered on religion, life and 
death. Today, the most popular animes 
are typified by conflicts between the 
same old badasses and newbie-with-
hidden-potential protagonists — an 
tried-and-true conceit, but without 
any depth to keep my eyes open. What 
happened to the nuances? It’s as if all 
the new shows are mashups of old 
formulas.

Perhaps I’m just giving them a 
hard time, or becoming that old guy 
who doesn’t get it and has a hard 
time adapting to generational change. 
Perhaps anime has always been like 
this: every new show simply a revision 
of a previous one. Perhaps all media 
follows this pattern, and I’m in denial.

But come on — does it all have to 
be so terrible? I’m all for re-introduc-
ing old concepts in new shells, but

BEST OF THE BASEMENT

W
hen most of 
us think about 
student film, 
we can’t help 
but imag-

ine shaky camera work, 
middle-school dialogue and 
plotlines that shoot leagues 
too far into the deep end.

Tonight, though — 
beginning 8 p.m. at the 
Loft in Price Center East 
— a lineup of short films 
will attempt to disprove 
that stereotype. They’re 
roughly seven minutes each, 
and they’re all part of the 
Up&Coming film festival: 
a showcase of the best and 
brightest camera work with-
in the UCSD community.

According to Sixth 
College senior Liz Hood, 
the energy and quality of 
the films at the festival 
always varies. The film-
studies department tends to 
employ more guest lecturers 
than permanent professors, 
making it difficult to pre-
dict the particular styles and 
influences likely to stand 
out each year.

This year, student direc-
tors have been blessed with 
inspiration from spirited 
professors like Michael 
Trigilio and Babette 
Mangoldte, who have made 
it a point to promote col-
laboration above individual 
isolation — ensuring diver-
sity, if nothing else.

Established by Art 
Power three years ago as a 
way to celebrate innovation 
in the undergraduate circle, 
the festival consists of eight 
shorts in 2010, pre-selected 
by a jury of local film 
experts and critics. Each 
pick highlights student 
achievement in a specific 
area, including screenwrit-
ing, experimentation and 
narrative development.

“The students are doing 
wildly different kinds of 
work,” Trigilio said. “It 
really spans the gamut.” 

Members of the review 
committee included KPBS 
film critic Beth Accomando 
and New York Museum of 
Modern Art video curator

THURSDAY, MAY 20, 20107 THE UCSD GUARDIAN  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG/HIATUS

D irector Charlie Oates’ version of “Seven Against Thebes” — based on the third play in Aeschylus’ Oedipus trilogy, and running 
as the current headliner at the Mandell Weiss 
Forum Theatre — falls simplistic and hokey 
in its attempt to reimagine the famous drama 
about a divided Grecian family. In the original, 
Oedipus’ two sons’ fight for control of Thebes — 
told through a series of dramatic monologues, 
performed by Theban 
citizens and the city’s 
ruler, Eteocles. The drama is 
meant to culminate in an all-
out brawl between Eteocles 
and his exiled brother Poly-
nices, taking the piece on 
a thought-provoking foray 
into the morality of war.

For his rendition, how-
ever, Oates uproots and replants the plot in Civil 
War-era Kentucky. To complicate things even 
further, the play was directly translated from the 
original Greek by theater professor Marianne 
McDonald — meaning the script brims with 
references to Greek gods and locations that have 
nothing to do with the American South.

While the brother-vs.-brother and divided-
nation themes mesh well with the new setting, 
the play never justifies the random displacement 
of mythological heroes, polytheistic deities and 
a besieged ancient city. What’s more, a lack 
of sufficient plot buildup leaves the audience 
wondering why an exiled brother would even 

want to fight for control of the gaunt, dirty and 
poverty-stricken people who live there in the 
first place. The play grows increasingly dis-
jointed as actors in filthy rags and lean-tos rattle 
off lengthy speeches about their nonexistent 
“city” in twangy Southern accents. 

That’s not to say that the rural setting isn’t 
compelling. Setting the stage with familiar 
bluegrass tune “I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow,” 

the play’s soundtrack mimics 
that of another retelling of an 
ancient Greek saga: the Coen 
brothers’ “O Brother, Where 
Art Thou?” Still, while the gos-
pel injects some much-needed 
energy into the drama, there 
remains a distinct undercur-
rent of melancholy that keeps 
the action serious.

Sadly, the music is not enough to make 
“Thebes” come to life. Made up almost entirely 
of monologues, the play lacks any actual move-
ment. Only the messenger — played by Chris-
topher James Cortez with acrobatic gusto — 
breaks up the monotony of the stage directions. 

Somewhere between ancient Greece, Ken-
tucky and UCSD, “Thebes” lost the edge that 
makes it the quintessential depiction of power 
struggle to this day. Aeschylus’ meta-commen-
tary on violence and the human condition may 
still ring true, but Oates abandons his audience 
in the Bluegrass State with nothing but straw to 
chew on.

druthers FILMREVIEW

By Jenna Brogan
Hiatus Editor

T he “Shrek” franchise has been pumping out sequel after sequel for the last decade, on a dragon 
wing and a prayer that Mike Myers 
and Eddie Murphy can still make the 
kids giggle. Hmm. How to break this 
to them gently? 

In the latest and final chapter of 
the seemingly never-ending series 
— which has almost reached “Land 
Before Time” proportions — our jolly 
green anti-hero is stuck in a midlife 
crisis. With three wee ogies, an inex-
haustible honey-do-this list from Fiona 
(Cameron Diaz) and a day-in day-out 
diaper routine, Shrek (Mike Myers) 
longs for the good ol’ days, when his 
sole responsibility was terrorizing the 
townsfolk. His frustration comes to a 
boiling point at the triplets’ birthday 
party, where he smashes their cake 

before storming off into the woods.
It’s here that the film begins to walk 

the line of prequel and sequel. Turns 
out villainous ginger Rumpelstiltskin 
(Walt Dohrn) — who rivals Lord 
Farquaad in height and Pee Wee 
Herman in voice 
— was making a 
deal with Fiona’s 
parents just as 
Shrek was sav-
ing her from 
the dragon’s 
keep in the 
2001 original. 
Rumpelstiltskin 
agreed to free 
Fiona from her curse in exchange for 
the keys to the kingdom.

Seeing as his original plan was 
obviously thwarted, Shrek’s current 
predicament becomes the perfect 
opportunity for Rumpelstiltskin’s 
revenge. Blinded by frustration, Shrek 

offers up any one day of his past in 
exchange for one day in the life of a 
carefree ogre. In a poof of evil green 
smoke, Rumpelstiltskin chooses the 
day Shrek was born, and the world’s 
most lovable monster is thrust into a 

sad, dark world 
in which he never 
existed. 

In this alter-
nate reality, 
Rumpelstiltskin 
reigns as king 
with the help of 
his witch minions, 
and — get excited, 
feminists — Fiona 

is the leader of the Resistance, an 
underground ogre movement deter-
mined to overthrow the tyrant with 
pitchforks and chimichangas. 

An obvious homage to “It’s a 
Wonderful Life,” this installment is a 
helluva lot weightier than the previ-

ous three. Sure, the burps, farts and 
snarky pop-culture references are all 
there, but only to cover up the fattest 
load of overlying adult existentialism 
we’ve seen so far in the series. More 
than ever, underlying messages are 
bound to get lost in translation to the 
rows of confused kindergarteners in 
the theater.

The “Shrek” series has never been 
entirely innocent — as per the infa-
mous “Maybe he’s compensating for 
something” joke, in reference to the 
size of Farquaad’s castle — but the 
swamp humor used to be enough to 
keep the kiddies entertained while the 
more mature jokes flew stealthily over 
their heads.

Sadly, though, the innocent-slap-
stick side of the scale is unbearably 
light this time around. Who goes to 
an animated comedy to be told that

Shrek’s Midlife Crisis Makes for One Depressing Ever-After to the Four-Part Dreamworks Dynasty

Rajendra Roy. But the true success 
of a festival will be measured by the 
caliber of its student entries.

“As the director, everything falls 
on you, so it’s really stressful,” senior 
Joanne Park — at the helm of “Just 
Curious” — said.

With a run time of 10 minutes, 
“Curious” is one of the longest pieces 
at the festival — a hefty undertak-
ing that Park said required her to 
feed and pay actors from her own 
pocket, just so they’d sit through the 
end of grueling takes. Her dedication 
shows: Throughout the piece, Park’s 
HD camera captures her intricately 
control of color contrast and lighting, 
putting an eerily professional sheen 
on an otherwise familiar story about 
a student with a crush on his brilliant 
TA. Held up by Park’s clever script, 
the film is an arty look at a genuine, 
unpretentious slice of life at UCSD.

That same type of honesty char-
acterizes Hood’s “Again Comes 
November” — a heartbreaking tribute 
to her departed friend Gho. Haunting 
narration explores a string of memo-
ries, told through black-and-white 
stagings of the silly, the romantic and 
the tragic — divergent moments that 
defined their relationship. 

“Black-and-white has a certain 
separation from reality, Hood said. 
“And while memories are based on 
reality, they just aren’t.” 

Though far-off moments range 
from prom to running through a 
park in nothing but underwear, each 
is brutally candid, demonstrating 
Hood’s ability to move an her audi-
ence by capturing head-on the type of 
yearning we often try to suppress.

“Nothing is worse than people 
who don’t understand you or [what] 
you’ve been through,” Hood said. “In 
sharing experiences, people learn that 
they’re not alone.”

I t appears Nas hasn’t writ-ten off hip-hop completely. Four years after he first 
lamented the death of the 
genre, he’s going back to hip-
hop’s roots to try and revive it 
from the ground up, collabo-
rating with Damian Marley 
for an invigorating blend of 
rap and reggae on 13-track 
narrative Distant Relatives.

Mostly produced by 
Marley himself, Relatives 
meanders through a varied 
blend of laid-back rhythms 
and upbeat jams, live instru-
mentation and looped-out 
samples, hand percussion 
and standard drum kits — 
keeping the project fresh 
from start to finish.

Together for their first 
full-length, the artists 
engage in a balanced game 
of give-and-take that never 
feels forced, their mutual 
maturity more evident than 
on any solo work either has 
produced since the last time 
they collaborated: on 2005 
single “Road to Zion.”

The marriage between 
Nas’ strong, raspy raps and 
Jr. Gong’s rapid sing-song 
shines brightest on fast-
paced opener “As We Enter.” 
As they pass the mic atop 
an old-school drum track 
and simple synth arpeggio, 
their divergent vocalizations 
merge in poetic perfection. 
Nas’ flow is as thick as ever, 
and he opts against record-
ing doubles on his verses — 
instead turning up the reverb 

to match Marley’s echoey dub 
vocals.

Marley plays with tricky 
melodies on “Patience,” at 
the same time providing 
his complex lyrical critique 
of Africa’s social turmoil. 
It’s given even more depth 
alongside a minimal, half-
time beat held together by a 
stuttering hi-hat and quick 
acoustic downstrokes.

Socially conscious “My 
Generation” — featuring a 
cough-syrup cameo from 
jailbird Lil Wayne — samples 
a children’s choir on the 
hook, beginning to teeter 
on the brink of cheesy. But 
a heavy, trembling bassline 
thickened by Marley’s 
forceful delivery and Nas’ 
solid schemes bring it back 
to reality: “Can you blame 
my generation’s subjective 
gentrification/ Depicting 
their frustrations over ill 
instrumentation?”

Relatives rides a largely 
unexplored sound, tied down 
by unwavering lyrical focus 
on the connections between 
the artists’ musical and per-
sonal backgrounds. As Nas 
puts it, the duo takes it back 
to “a world buried in time, 
uncovers it with rhymes” 
— giving us a modern-day 
classic while they’re at it.

Nas and Damian Marley 
will perform live at UCLA’s 
JazzReggae Festival on May 
31.

I f Jack White is a lunatic (not entirely impossible), then supergroup the Dead 
Weather is the hotwired 
Oldsmobile with which he 
runs down innocent bystand-
ers while screaming insane 
one-liners about mayhem and 
destruction. Sophomore Dead 
Weather effort Sea of Cowards 
is Icky Thump on steroids: 35 
minutes of vicious guitar solos 
and enough crazed screech 
sessions to make System of a 
Down blush crimson. 

At its rollicking best, the 
chaos is cathartic, but too 
often the fury fails to instill in 
us anything beyond a fleeting, 
blood-pumping high. Luck-
ily, band members Allison 
Mosshart and Dean Fertita are 
too talented to let the album 
dip below mediocrity. White 
ditches his trademark guitar 
for the drums, while Fertita 
(of Queens of the Stone Age 
fame) delivers a steady barrage 
of sufficiently disturbed lyrics. 
In fact, the drums are the only 

tame aspect of Sea of Cowards, 
while both bass and guitar 
work to assault the listener like 
a sonic boom and White and 
Mosshart take turns pouring 
rage into the microphone. 

And there are just enough 
twists in their ferocity to 
prevent either vocalist from 
becoming a mosquito in our 
ear. Likewise, the brevity of the 
album (all 11 songs come in at 
under four minutes) prevents 
its guitars from becoming 
grating. “Die by the Drop” 
is a highlight, with a gritty 
keyboard and guitar intro that 
segues into a massive hook — 
laying down the groundwork 
for a blistering vocal clash 
between White and Mosshart. 

White’s lack of inhibition is 
always a pleasure, but this par-
ticular project never achieves 
greatness — hampered by a 
shortage of catchy hooks or 
memorable guitar lines that no 
flurry of passion can rectify.

“happily ever after” is just an illusion? We 
go because we want to see the Gingerbread 
Man squeal until his gumdrop buttons pop 
off. 

Perhaps that’s the reason director Mike 
Mitchell opted for kid-friendly 3-D, send-
ing broomsticks careening toward our faces 
and at least allowing us to laugh at how 
everyone looks in dorky spectacles. 

But the franchise can no longer rely 
on cutting-edge technology for popularity 
(just compare its animation, which was 
revolutionary in the early 2000s, to Disney’s 
recent “How to Train Your Dragon”). 
Instead, the series, which averages about 
$341 million per installment, will continue 
to be critically acclaimed for its devotion 
to the formula: Woo children with furry 
woodland creatures and entertain their 

parents with sly witticisms. 
But — while the fairytale mashup’s 

hilarious voice-to-character juxtaposition 
and singing Donkey may have won us over 
10 years ago — the comedic, visual and 
musical stalemate (yes, we’re forced to sit 
through “I’m a Believer” again) of “Shrek 
Forever After” makes it hard to remember 
why on Earth we loved it so much in the 
first place. 

I t’s only been two years since blues-rock duo the Black Keys emerged with debut Attack 
and Release — but that short 
period has seen an exhausting 
list of releases, including a hip-
hop collaboration album with 
heavyweights like RZA and Mos 
Def, not to mention solo albums 
from both members.

It shouldn’t come as a sur-
prise, then, that Brothers trades 
the energy of Attack for a more 
relaxed and immersive stoner 
vibe; there was only so long they 
could blaze such a fiery trail.

First single “Tighten Up” 
is the only track produced by 
Danger Mouse (one-half of 
both Gnarls Barkley and Broken 
Bells, and the producer of all 
Attack). It’s sleek and poppy: 
Every instrument carefully fol-
lows the melody, as echoed 
vocals and occasional keyboards 
are underlaid with the same 
ringtone-ready guitar riffs that 
defined their debut.

But the rest of Brothers is 
designed to suck us further in, 

with buzzing-kazoo guitars and 
keyboards that split from the 
core melody — forcing us to 
pick through distorted layers if 
we wish to understand the entire 
track.

Everything about the album 
is geared toward a holistic listen-
ing experience — even the way 
drummer Patrick Garney clicks 
away at the cymbals in “Sinister 
Kid” with Farmville intensity. 
It’s got the energy to immerse 
us, but won’t give us a reason to 
stand up and yell.

It’s a jarring change in 
character, though the Keys do 
politely pass on the opportu-
nity to break out Floyd-esque 
intricacies that we’d need Bose 
headphones and Planet Earth 
on Blu-Ray to appreciate. But 
they end up lost somewhere in 
between, stripping away snappy 
riffs for muddy rhythms. Light 
up and lay back, ’cause Brothers 
will never bring you to the edge 
of your seat.

SPORTS� THURSDAY, MAY 20, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 11 

about our lack of a football team, we 
fail to notice that our men’s baseball 
team is the country’s No. 1-ranked team 
in Division-II, and — in one week’s 
time  — could very well be the D-II 
College World Series champions. Now 
that’s something worth cheering about.

 On most other campuses, the 
baseball players would be celebrated as 
heroic student-athlete gods, negotiating 
crowds of adoring students everywhere 
they went. Here, senior first baseman 
Brandon Gregorich — who was recent-
ly named the player of the year in the 
West Region by the National Collegiate 
Baseball Writers Association — is about 
as anonymous as the next pre-med 
major. Sure, sports aren’t for everyone, 
but it’s a shame that — now that we 
actually have some legit athletic talent 
— sports are still seemingly for no one.

For Triton athletes, all this means 
that their last two years of work — dur-
ing which they’ve posted a jaw-drop-
ping 92-22 overall record (averaging a 
staggering eight wins every 10 games), 
earned back-to-back regular-season, 
conference and regional championship 
titles and won countless individual and 
team honors — has gone completely 
unappreciated by the average UCSD 
student. The brilliant work they’ve put 
in on the playing field has garnered 
the praise of college baseball analysts 
perched in high media towers across the 
nation, but is unrecognized at a school 
where feats in a laboratory or lecture 
hall are far more worthy of mention.

Perhaps no better an indication of 
the general disregard for the team is its 
home-field location. The underwhelm-
ing Triton Ballpark was plopped way 
out in the desolate concrete jungle of 
East campus, impossible not to over-
look. There are a few bleachers, a regu-
lation field and little else. No bright 
floodlights. No stately scoreboard. No 
proud Triton billboard — nothing even 
slightly resembling the sort of ameni-
ties one would expect on the field of 
the nation’s finest D-II team.

Literally right across the street 
stands the unmistakable pride and joy 
of UCSD: Scripps Hospital. It’s tall, 
imposing and proud, with a multistory 
parking lot out-glowing the evening 
dusk. Apparently, it’s been deemed a 
more appropriate location for flood-
lighting. In fact, when standing behind 
home plate at night, the light from the 
hospital illuminates the field better than 
anything actually inside the stadium.

The juxtaposition of the well-
endowed hospital — home to a team 
of reputable medical practitioners — to 
Triton Ballpark — humble field home 
to equally surgical ballplayers — is a 
telltale symbol of our priorities. But we 
shouldn’t have to choose.

Last week, when the Tritons com-
peted from May 13 to May 15 at the 
NCAA West Regional Championships 
for a spot in the NCAA D-II College 
World Series, they had earned the No. 
1 seed’s right to home-field advantage 
But, in the end, they were denied the 
chance to claim that right. The regional 
tournament, which includes some night 
games, had to be moved from Triton 
Ballpark due to its lack of sufficient 
lighting. Because of this inadequacy, the 
Tritons were forced to claim regional 
honors in Compton, Calif., on a field 
closer in proximity to direct rivals Cal 
State Dominguez Hills and far less 
familiar than their La Jolla playing plot.

Still — despite being virtually 
neglected by what is supposed to be 
their fan base and sold short in home-
field accommodations — this year’s 
baseball players cannot be stopped.

They have shrugged off waves of 
national recognition — in the form of 
polls, power rankings and individual/
team awards — with exactly the same 
indifference that this campus shows 
toward their record accomplishments. 
Neither national recognition nor local 
neglect has affected their game.

Senior catcher Kellen Lee, who 
earned NCBWA honorable mention for 
his contribution to this year’s pitching 
staff, exemplifies this humble attitude.

“We are proud that the entire coun-
try recognizes us as one of the premier 
teams at the Division-II level,” Lee said. 
“But we try not to get caught up in the 
rankings.”

It’s a wonder that the Tritons 
have made it so far, considering the 
constraints on the UCSD Athletic 
Department. Though he is not 
equipped with the ability to attract pre-
mier baseball prospects with competi-
tive athletic scholarships, head coach 
Dan O’Brien has built a winning pro-
gram from the ground up, stressing the 
time-tested creed of good, hard work. 
O’Brien, in his 13th season, now heads 
a perennial powerhouse of a program, 
despite his sparse recruiting resources. 
For the second straight year, he is 
the CCAA Coach of The Year — an 
accomplishment this fan would argue 
is as exemplary as any medical honor 
received across the street (OK, different 
degrees of importance, but still).

To the people of UCSD: Get your 
heads out of your textbooks. You’ve 
wanted something to cheer about, 
something to pride yourself on — and 
now you’ve got no excuse not to cheer. 
Thirty-eight of your fellow students 
have handed you an opportunity for 
school spirit on a platter. The current 
baseball team is arguably the greatest 
in UCSD history. Even if you don’t like 
baseball in particular, take a second to 
recognize their feats. If you see a Triton 
player walking around campus in his 
warmups, wish him luck this weekend. 
If you do like baseball, tune in to the 
live stream on http://www.ncaa.com 
on Saturday, May 22 at 2:00 p.m. when 
they take on Georgia College & State.

When the College World Series 
kicks off this Saturday in Cary, N.C., 
the UCSD baseball team — whether 
it wins or loses — will be representing 
our school on a national stage. Even 
if you are the most indifferent, sports-
apathetic student on campus, consider 
turning on the game in the background 
as you study or play video games. You 
might just get inspired.

Association, which includes all 
D-II public schools in California. 
Come May 22, senior right-hander 
Matt Rossman and junior righty 
Tim Shibuya will lead off the rota-
tion. Rossman — a transfer from 
UC Riverside — has gone 9-0 
with a 2.45 ERA in an impressive 
senior campaign, earning CCAA 
Pitcher of the Year honors for his 
efforts. Shibuya, a Wyoming native 
and Triton walk-on, has also put 
together an outstanding 
season, going 12-2 with 
a 1.95 ERA. 

Having two aces like 
Shibuya and Rossman 
is a rare luxury for any 
team, but the Tritons’ 
real pitching strength 
lies in their depth at the 
position. 

Rounding out the 
rotation are right-
handers senior Kirby St. 
John and junior Guido 
Knudson. St. John 
is 11-1 on the year — 
compiling a 3.92 ERA 
— while Knudson is 9-3 
with a 4.09 ERA. The 
bullpen is led by senior closer 
Daniel Simmons, who has given 
the Tritons a solid game-closing 
option this season with a 2.25 ERA 
and three saves. 

The team’s pitchers have seen 
no lack of offensive support. 
Overall, the Triton offense has bat-
ted .371, and leads the CCAA in 
hits, runs scored and nearly every 
other offensive category. 

Their stacked lineup is headed 
by senior first baseman Brandon 
Gregorich, who has batted in 84 
runs — a school record. He also 
led the team in average (.469) and 
hits (99), earning him the CCAA 
Player of the Year award. 

Aaron Bauman, Evan Kehoe 
and junior catcher Kellen Lee 

tied for a team best eight home 
runs, while senior shortstop Vance 
Albitz became the all-time Triton 
hits leader. Like the pitching staff, 
the UCSD offense is deep with tal-
ent: Ten players racked up 30 RBIs 
throughout the season. 

At the helm is head coach Dan 
O’Brien, who — in his 13th season 
— has turned the program into 
one of the nation’s best. For the 
second straight season, the Tritons 
earned a CCAA regular-season 

title, a CCAA tourna-
ment title and a trip 
College World Series. 
His efforts have not 
gone unnoticed: 
O’Brien snagged 
his second straight 
CCAA Coach of the 
Year award in 2010. 

The Tritons will 
open champion-
ship play in a double 
elimination tourna-
ment against south-
east region champion 
Georgia College & 
State University — 
which holds a record 
of 39-15 — beginning 

at 5 p.m. EST on May 22. The 
tournament will be held at the 
USA Baseball National Training 
Complex. 

“We are preparing by hav-
ing solid and quality practices 
with a great focus and intensity,” 
Knudson said. “We are going to 
keep working hard in being fully 
prepared for that first pitch in 
Cary.”

Should UCSD win its opening 
game, they will face the winner of 
the Tampa and Central Missouri 
match-up. The Spartans and the 
Mules are ranked second and third 
in the nation respectively.

T he most important week of the Triton baseball season has arrived. The No. 1-ranked team will head to Cary, N.C. this weekend for the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division-II championships. This is the second straight year the Tritons have earned a spot in the eight-team D-II College 
World Series: Last year they bowed out in a heartbreaking loss to Emporia 
State in the semifinals.

The Tritons currently have a 51-7 win-loss record overall, and are 35-5 
in conference play. Though the team was ranked No. 3 nationally in the 
preseason, it had moved into the top spot by mid-March. Following a 
stumble against conference rivals Cal State San Bernardino, the Tritons 
dropped to No. 4 on April 9, but regained the No. 1 spot on May 5, where 
they currently sit. 

UCSD will enter the tournament on a hot streak, having just won the 
D-II west regional title and 18 of their last 19 games overall.

“We look forward to performing well there, and finishing what we 
started last year in Cary, North Carolina,” senior catcher Kellen Lee said.

The Triton pitching staff has stayed solid all year long, combining for 
a 3.17 earned run average — the lowest in California Collegiate Athletic

T he secret’s out: UCSD is no athlete’s paradise. Our school spirit is most apparent during team study sessions in Geisel, 
not in the stadium cheering on our teams 
like most other cool college kids.

Most of us adopt a habit of bitching 
and moaning about how we lack school 
spirit — constantly complaining about 
how no one is as cool as they themselves 
are — but often do nothing to help the sit-
uation. That’s why, while everyone bitches
