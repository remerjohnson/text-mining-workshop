This Com.missioner Will Be a UCSD Graduate? 
Editor: 

Late Jut quarter, your newspaper

and lack of accomplishment that

authored by an AS committee

recreation center. 

that this will all chan,(e for the better at 
the completion' of mult·m~lion doDar 
con.truction projects, particularly after 
Jarvis II, i.so absutd as to warrant the 
immediate incarceration of 
Montgomery for his own safety, and 
the safety of the Yf"neral public. 

grammar is abysmal. Judging from the 
use and context of certain words, he 
evidently is w~lIy ignorant of their 
meaning. He pretend. to discuss an 
important issue, yet he does not even 
begin to consider any of tile root 
causes. This mal' i, going to graduate

Montgomery points out that the 
retention rate lor the dall padualing 
in 1981 i. expected to be ooIy 37 
percent, and this rate is expected to 
decline to 32 percent for the dan of 
1983. In hi. worda: "Projections for. 
the dall of 1983 are somewhat more 
optimiltic: 32 percent are not expected 
to graduate aloag with their enterint 
daurnates." ThOle leu than moribw1d 
among us will note that this sentence 
mean. many things l)I' noth .. at aD. If ' 
32 percent of the dass 01 1983 il not 
expected to paduate that year, then 
we can infer that 68 percent of them 
d. One can certainly be optimiatic: if 
the retention rate rileS from 37 to 68 
percent in only two years. Thil is, of 
course, patenlly false and a 
consequence of grammatical 

The fact that UCSD is primarily a 
school of science, often called "Cal 
Tech South." and that this sort of .tudy 
by its very nature eeemsto limit one's 
social life. i. not even mentioned, let 
alone considered. 

In fact, hil own idea 01 social life is 
rather limited. Hil notion can be eaaily 
summarized by one of the important 
question. he raises in one of the photo 
caption. in hil letter: "Yet a simple 
question remains: where could we hold 
a TGIF if it is raining?" Forget 
Afghani.tan; where can I drink my 
beer? 

'To my mind, the .imple question 
that really remains is: Why are our fees

They merely aciuander our fees on this 
sort of advertising and provide beer on

previous letter, these people were voted 
in by about 50 percent margins in a 15

I would like to' formally propose to 
the students of UCSD and to 
Chancellor McfJroy that the grCK.\P of

Carter Tries Carrot: ' 
. Offers Help ' ~o Iran· 

WASHINGTON - Prelident Carter extended an olive 
branch to Iran's revolutionary regime despite the continued 
captivity of the American hostages in Tehran. But he warned 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's forces that America'. patience 
is "not un~mited." 

There was no immediate response from Iran. Earlier Monday, 
Foreign Minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh lumped American 
imperialism and Soviet communism together as threats to his 
country. 

Meanwhile, the approximately 50 hostages in the US 
Embassy in Tehran began their 80th day in captivity. . 

Carter, in the pre·released text of his State of the Union 
message to Congress said the United Slates has "no basic 
quarrel with the nation, the revolution or the people of Iran." 

"The threat to them comes not from American foreign policy 
but from Soviet actions in the region," the president declared. 

Carter said hi. government is "p~pared to work with the 
government of Iran to develop a new and mutually beneficial 
rdationship. But that ~I not be possible so long as Iran 
continues to hold Americans hostage, in defiance of the world 
commwtity and civi~zed behavior: They must be released 
unharmed." . 

TIle president said the US goverrvnent so far has "pursued a 
measured program of peaceful diplomatic and economic steps in 
an attempt to resolve this issue without resorting to other 
remedies available to us" 

"But our patience is not unlimited, and our concern for the 
well-being of our fdlow citizen. grow. every day," he warned . 

Gotbzadeh in a broadcast presidential campaign speech said -
iran's borders "are in danger" because of the presence of Soviet 
troops in Afghanistan. He said Iran is "ready to render every 
assistance for putting an end to the soviet intervention in 
Afghanistanoo.and in order to safeguard the interests of our 
country we should take decisive action on the Soviet threat." 

However, he gave no hint of any specific action . 
Ghotbzadeh /Was one of eight men on the final list of 

candidates, broadcast by Tehran Radio, for the presidential 
election Friday. 

Medi-Cal Budget 
Revives Abortion Ire 

SACRAMENTO - Pro and anti·abortion forces converged 
at the state Capitol yesterday, the Seventh 'anniver.ary 01 the US 
Supreme Court's abortion decision, to renew their aMual battle 
over .tate funding of abortions. 

As in past years, anti-abortion forces outnumbered their pro· 
abortion foes in rival demonltration •. 

No measure is immediatdy before legislative committees 
concerning abortions. 

But both Iides are bracing for another battle thil spring over 
inclusion in the state'l 1980·81 Medi·Ca1 budget of $32 million 
for an expected 107,000 taxpayer.financed abortion. for low· 
income women. 

Anti·abortion forces have cut thOlle funds the palt two years, 
but their victories have been bIoclced by court order. 

California Pro· Life Council president Carmen T ruialo aI.o 
said anti-abortion groups wiD try to revive a so·called uinformed 
consent" bill defeated last year. Under that measure, doctors 
would be required to inform pregnant women about medical 
ri.k. in abortion and describe the development of the fetus. 

The Pro·Life Council massed about 1,000 penons for a 
march and rally outside the Capitol. the San Francisco Bay Area 
Pro-Choice Coalition, which IUpports state funding for 
abortions r~ied about 75 personl for a news conference. 

The ~o<hoice group also delivered apple pies with tiny 
American Rag. to 50 legislators who have supported abortion 
measures and apple cores to 41 legislators who have opposed 
them. They said 28 other legislators weren't "good enough" to 
.. apple pies, but not bad enough lor the apple cores • 

Coalition leader Pal Miller said the pies were intended to ' 
demonitrate that "choice i. al American a. apple pie. Abortion 
can be a very positive influence in America. 

"Few risftts are as basic as the freedom to decide when and if 
to become a parent." .he said. addillll that women camot attain 
true equality and equal job opportunities if they cannot control 
.hen or if they will bear children. 

The tone of the anti·abortion group was more somber and 
more strident, inciudillll char.. that Planned Parenthood i. 
racist. . 

"We have come here to conunemorate the over 5 million 
bebies iii .... nationally since 1973," when the U~ ~ 
Court ruled that the right to privacy is broad enough to include a 
woman'. decision to have an abortion, said M •. Trujillo, the Pro· 
Lie leader.

Bakke Ruling: 
Not In Calif? 

SACRAMENTO - A 
state appeals court, 
denouncing the US Supreme 
Court's Bakke decision, says 
the University of Califoma 
may not give preference to 
minorities in law school 
admissions, even without 
quotas. 

But the state appeals court 
said that any consideration of 
race violates the California 
Constitution's guarantee that 
no poup of citizen. can be 
granted "privileges or 
il,nmunities not granted on the 
same terms to aD citizens." 
Draft Reg Again 
Said a Possibility 

AU branchea 01 the miIbuy '. 
fell short of ~." .'. 
for filcal 1979, lor IhI lint 
time since the draft ended in " 
1973. But Defense ..,.. 
menl officials concer .... with

Tuesday that the Pent.aon 
had lent no . stall :r:,; 
recommending a ~ of 
regi.tration to the White 
House. 

Monday's 2·} decision by 
the 3rd District Court of 
Appeal, if upheld by higher 
courts, would exclude 
California from the partial 
victory won by minorities in 
the US Supreme Court's 1978 
Bakke ruling. 

The Bakke decision, also 
based on a UC Davis 
program, said racial quotas 
may not be used in 
professional school admis· 
sions but race may be 
considered as one factor 
among others in admissions 
decisions. 

WASHINGTON - Presi· 
dent Carter, in what would be 
an abrupt reversal of 
administration po~cy, is said 
to be considering asking 
Congress to authorize 
peacetime registration of draft· 
age youths. 

Administration sources said 
Tuesday they believed the 
proposal came from within the 
White House staff. 

It was not known whether 
Carter would accept the 
proposal or include it in his 
State of the Union address to 
Congress tonight, said the 
sources, who asked not to be 
identified .

In talking about the F..dinbw-gh 
FflItivai Addison said the event waa 
"'the most exb'aordiwy international 
,.therint 01 artists." He went on to uy 
how rare this kind of experience i. for 
the students. It gives the acton and 
eckessel a chance to work 
undistracted for a full six week 
reheaDai period, plus the rtunity 
to be teen by , and tee:&: other 
performing troupes al the festival. 
Addison has c:hoaed to do Medea, a 
4O-minute V.udevile show compiled 
out 01 veious material. 

For Addison. am il a sreat penonaI 
opportunity too. He says he hat alway. 
wanted to do Medea and ·when Jean 
Korf, (ClrlfarUer of the California 
Repertory) approached him about the 
festival he Imew thil was the time 10 do 
it. He hu a falcination wilh

more precisely Tragedy, and wu 
reeponsible for putting on two ahpwa of

charilma and hi. ability 10

lhe beat of his meet .lyle of rhythm 
and bluet rock 'n roll. Above all, Pelty 
it a believable performer, and this 
creales a sort of affinity with the 
"lClience that it obviously one 01 the 
key. to hil success. He it "euy to 
relate to"-no hype, no Ouh, just 
character.

blues prosreslions we've all come to 
Icnow and IIfOw bored of over ~ 
years. 'Th.:re i. no doubt in my mind 
that Campbell i. capable of playing a

m)' mind that Petty doesn't wanl him 
to. 1lutt'1 why the band il called Tom 
Petty and the Heart"'eakera. 

The belt IOngl of the evening were 
"Refugee", "I'm a Fool Again", "Here 

Comes My Girf", "I Need To Know" 
and "Breakdown". During each of 
these tongl, Petty wu at his beal

played tightly, with dOle attention paid .

But the biggest IUrprile of the 
evening wu the opening ael, The 
Fabuloul Poodles. Powering through

Petty- Too 
Easy For 
Audience? 
Continued from ptJfe 7 
(of all thing.) an electric violin 
played through a mouth box (a 
device normally used with a 
guitar, as with jeff Beck and 
Peter Frampton). These boy. 
are a rarity among New Wave 
acll becauae they aU four .ing, 
and . ~y are all competent 
mU.ICUUlI. 

The Poodles. ike Petty. 
were able to communicate 
with their audience. and their 
sense of hwnor was refreahing . 

. A. if to challenge any heavy 
metal rockers in the audience 
who may not ave been 
thrilled about their brand of 
New Wave mu.ic. The 
Poodlea asked for requeats, 
and then played ( with amazing 
competence) Jimi Hendrix's 
"Purple Haze". 

They ~ame back for one 
encore. The au~nce wanted 
two. I don't ~w what their 
album. are like, but I would 
recommeod their live show to 

an~one. 
Tom Petty teemed to be 

performing with a casual air-
a down·to·earth approach. 
The Pooclea teemed to be 
working with 8 theme of anti-
.tardom and humor. In thi. 
eenee, the two acta were 
congruous, but musically they 
were not .• wouldn't brins up 
the subiect of who toon with 
who if it were not for aD the talk 
I've heard about Petty 
"bridging the gap" between 
New Wave and mainltream 
rock 'n roD. 

Such daims are absurd. 
The Poodlea are New Wave. 
Tom Petty ill rock 'n roD. 
MUlicaUy and viauaDy they 
have little in common. . 

The Fabulou. Poodlea play 
New Wave music with a twi.t . 
Tom Petty's mulic, however • 
is no more New Wave than is 
Bob Seger's. It'. just plain old 
tasay rock 'n roll.

Roots of Rape In Family, Society 
By John Hondros 

Associate News Editor 
There was a discussion here on rape 

yesterday. 
And women were not invited. 
Six men, all UCSD students, joined Charles 

Nelson, a San Diego counselor for individuals 
and families, in the International Center to 
discuss social factors which lead a man to 
commit rape, as well as how to react to 
someone who has been raped. 

Nelson began the seminar by citing statistics 
showing that "one in every eight women is 
raped, and for black women the percentage is 
even higher." 

He said this high occurrence can be 
attributed to the sexist attitudes towarJ women 
that persist. ' 

"I remember a poster that came out that 
read, 'Stop Rape by Smashing Sexism' .. that's 
what I'm getting at. 

"It's easier to commit a violent act against 
someone who you think is inferior to you; it 
makes you feel more superior," Nelson said. 

The roots of .sexism which leads to 
"physically forced sexual activity," he said, lie 
at home with the family. 

"For years, studies on rape looked at the ' 
relationship between the rapist and his mother, 
when there is actually a need to study the 
relationship between the rapist and the father. 

"In our country, 50 percent of all women are 
battered by their husbands. Children 
experience the relationship of the father beating 

the mother. Our father is our role model whom 
we mimic as we get older, using violence to get 
our needs met." 

Nelson believes that our culture, as well, 
supports violent acts toward women. He said 
the ' Pat Travers song, "Boom Boom Out Go 
the Lights," ~hich treats wife·beating as 
humorous activity, is a case in point. 

, Nelson pointed out that certain personalities 
are more vulnerable to rape. Cay men who are 
"the gal boys" and women in distress are the 
"easiest to pick up," he said. 

One gay student in the group commented 
that gay men ar~ more likely to be "in tune" 
with the issue of rape. 

"People don't realize this happens just as 
much in the gay community," the student said. 

When asked by Nelson how one should react 
when a woman who is close has been assaulted, 
one student offered, "You need to make the 
woman feel not guilty . You have to be 
optimistic. " 

But Nelson had a different response in mind. 
"Once a rape happens, a woman feels a loss 

of power in her life. What she really needs is to 
feel she can make her own decisions." 

He said the problem can be remedied by 
"letting them say what they need to do," and 
not vice· versa. 

The seminar was sponsored by the Uc;SD 
Rape Prevention Education Program, which 
has two additional rape awareness workshops 
planned this week.

Starlrey "Y' tlwe is -no question" in his mind that 
the lOCiai situation has tOme effect on the enrollment 
at UCSD. ''The ...... of application. to the UC 
IChooIs is movin8 town the Iar. urban campuses," 
he aays. ' 

St.key admits that UCSD is isolated when 
compared to UCLA or UC Berkeley, but adds, 
"there wiI never be" another Westwood or 
Telegraph Ave. 

Chanir- in the Plans 
Before the May Stores developers got involved 

with the project in the late 1960's, La Jolla ViUage 
Square (then called Villa La JoIIa)w81 p1amed as 45 
acres of integrat.,d apartments, entertainment and 
education facilities in order to "qualify as a town and 
not another typical shopping center surrounded by 
uphait," according to the original master plan. 

'The university endoned the original concept, says 
CoILm, which had a design similar to a European 
pedestrian village. 

''The housing waa going to be buik on top of the 
stores and integrated with the community.

"The committee felt there was something very 
dehumanizing about a large department store ... we 
felt this concept would provide for a more intimate 
atmosphere," Colman say •. 

When May Stores bought the property and 
changed this concept, "there was a large outay from 
the university because their plans were not 
consi.tent," Collum says. 

The May Stores developers, daimed that the 
original plan waa not financially feasible. 

Another outay against the project occurred when 
changes were made in the residential units, which 
were originaUy to be two·bedroom units sold as 
student housing. 1be revisions involved the 
conversion of 75 two-bedroom units into 115 one· 
bedroom and "junior" (similar to a studio) t.Ulits. 

The CCPC was opposed to the change in plans 
because, they claimed, students can't afford to live in 
one·bedrqom units. 

When the City Planning Commi .. ion joined the 
CCPC and did not approve the revised plans, the 
developers appealed to the City Council, which voted 
6-1 in favor of the change, CoUum says. 

Fifty.five of the 115 units are presently rented by 
UCSD students, .. ys Beverly FJlis, residential 
manager for the center's Apartments on the Square. 
Although the apartments are not only rented to 
sh,Klents, they are "always given priority in moving 
in," she says. 

BECAUSE 

Rental fees are $275 a month for the junior 
apartments and $295 a month for the one·bedroom 
units, and a security deposit of $200 is required upon 
moving in, according to fJlis. The Off.Campus 
Housing Office says these rates are "competitive." 

In addition, 33 two-bedroom uoits wiD be built on 
the second Roor of the convenience center, and the 
rates wiD "probably be between $350·375 a month," 
says FJlis. Students will also be given priority in these 
units, which are scheduled to open in July, she says. 

Another plan revision, which may spark further 
protest from UCSD, involves the request filed with 
city planners Dec. 28 by the developers to add 
165,000 sq. ft. for additional retail stores and 50 
housing units. 

But the May Stores and Donald Bren partnership 
will have to surmount two legal hurdles before this is 
done. The developers must first receive authorization 
from the Planning Commission to amend its planned 
commercial development permit. 1bey wiD then have 
to go to the City Council for approval of a rezoning of 
the area from a hotel-motel designation to a 
commercial. 

The CCPC has not taken a position on this 
change, says CoIIwn, since an Environmental 
Impact RepOrt has yet to be prepared for the 
addition.
