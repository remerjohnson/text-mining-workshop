Student Voice! Dominates Single-Slate Election

WILL PARSON/GUARDIAN
Current Vice President of Student Life Donna Bean is the only candidate for next year’s A.S. presidency. Candidates for the three vice presidential positions are also running unopposed.

By Jesse Alm
Associate News Editor

Despite a landmark A.S. Council 
decision earlier this year to imple-
ment a system that enables vot-
ers to rank candidates in order of 
preference, unopposed races for all 
four A.S. executive positions this 
spring will leave student voters with 
less options at the polls than ever 
before.

Instant runoff voting had 
already been a popular initiative 
for four years before approval from 
TritonLink officials allowed the 
council to enact it last December. 
However, A.S. President Marco 
Murillo said that because the sys-
tem only applies to races with three 
or more candidates, and this year 
the top four positions — president 
and vice presidents of student life, 
finance and resources and external 
affairs — each have only one, gaug-
ing IRV’s impact on the election 
will be complicated.

“It’s unfortunate that we’re not 
going to be able to test out the 
new system we just put into place,” 
Murillo said.

He said that convincing people 

to vote at all in this election will 
present a challenge.

“As a councilperson, you want 
to make sure people are informed 
and know what’s going on, but at 
the same time, with only one per-
son running, it is difficult,” Murillo 
said. 

A.S. Vice President of Student 
Life Donna Bean, this year’s only 
candidate for A.S. president, said 
she agrees that the lack of compe-
tition will undermine the voting 
system’s democratic purpose.

“I don’t like the idea of basi-
cally having it handed to you,” she 
said. “A democratic structure only 
works if there are multiple people 
running.”

A.S. Elections Manager Tanya 
Piyaratanaphipat said she believed 
that the new voting system would 
encourage greater candidate partic-
ipation. She also said that that she 
was disappointed with the results 
last week, when all candidacy dec-
laration forms were due. 

There will be only one race, at 
Revelle College, for which IRV will 
be in effect. All officer positions 
are uncontested, and none of the 
all-campus positions has more than 
two candidates running.

“Having competitive races is great 
for all elections,” Piyaratanaphipat 
said. “It breeds innovation and 
encourages candidates to work 
toward their goals. I really wish 
that had happened.”

In addition to the small number 

of candidates overall, only three indi-
viduals announced candidacy out-
side the Student Voice! slate, a figure 
that Piyaratanaphipat said will affect 
the general dynamic of the election.

“We were really hoping that 
come noon there would be another 
slate that would come forward, not 
because we wanted Student Voice! 
to lose, but because we wanted to see 

competition,” she said. “[Without 
an opposition slate], the race is 
going to be different this year.”

Thurgood Marshall College 
Senator Kyle Samia, who has served 
on the council since 2005, said the 
low number of candidates — espe-
cially those not identifying with SV! 
— was unsurprising. He cited slate 
politics as a chief cause of this year’s 

election makeup.
“If a slate dominates, it keeps all 

of the powerful positions within a 
small community,” he said. “How 
are you going to debate someone 
on a referendum if you’ve never 
seen it? The crux of the issue is that 
Student Voice! has mastered the 

Candidates for top four 
A.S. executive slots run 
uncontested. Current VP 
Donna Bean stands as 
lone presidential hopeful.

Arts Library Takes Steps in Digital Direction
By Justin Gutierrez
Staff Writer

Following a decision by the dean and chair of the 
Division of Arts and Humanities, along with other 
top UCSD library administrators, the circulation of 
slides in the Arts & Architecture Library will be dis-
continued by the end of Winter Quarter.

On Feb. 19, faculty members were advised to 
familiarize themselves with ARTstor, an online data-
base for art and architecture slides, where UCSD’s 
collection has existed for four years.

In summer 2002, the main library in Geisel began 
to digitize its slide collection, after receiving a grant 
from the Andrew Mellon Foundation. The project 
was completed by July 2004, producing more than 
200,000 digital images and associated metadata, said 
Leslie Abrams, head of the Arts Libraries.

“At the time the project was completed, UCSD 
was the core contributor to the ARTstor database,” 
Abrams said. “Since then, many institutions have 
followed suit.”

ARTstor now contains approximately 550,000 
images of art and architecture.

In addition to the complete digitization of the 
A&AL slide collection, the various media depart-
ments located on Geisel Library’s basement level are 
preparing to be extensively revamped.

“We are currently in the ‘phasing’ process,” 
Abrams said. “That is to say, we are preparing for 
the demolition to come by removing things to make 
way.”

Abrams said the final goal of the renovation 
project is to have a single service desk to coordinate 

reference, information and reserves, where students 
can locate a wide variety of media materials, from 
film and videos to music scores and recordings.

“Currently, there are three service points, which 
is, many times, confusing to students,” she said. “We 
are making the research process easier, as well as 
allowing more open space and later hours.”

Because of property rights issues, not all film and 
video collections will be added to the digital data-
base. The discontinuation of the slide circulation is 
expected to affect only a small portion of the UCSD 
community.

“There is only a small number of faculty members 
who still use analog slides in their lectures,” Abrams 
said. “We have planned to give 12 faculty members 
access to the slides at their request. All of the slides 
will still be property of the UC regents.”

Faculty members had until Feb. 29 to inform 
the library if they wished to continue using the 
slides.

While the elimination of the slide collection may 
not significantly affect a campus at the forefront of 
technology, the physical reconfiguration of the dif-
ferent collections to provide space for demolition 
— which includes rearranging the Music Library’s 
books and scores — is ongoing. Some students have 
said they find the changes frustrating.

“I don’t go down there often, but when I do, I defi-
nitely will be confused,” Earl Warren College junior 
Kevin Lebenson said.

Though faculty are encouraged to give their lec-
tures using the Internet-equipped rooms through-
out most of campus, media theorist and UCSD 
visual arts professor Lev Manovich said that the 

slides’ elimination may be detrimental to the learn-
ing experience.

“I think that some complaints may be actually 
justified,” Manovich said. “Being able to work with 
thousands of images that are represented as objects 
in physical space has some advantages over working 
with digital images in a computer. This is the same 
reason why today all design and architecture studios 
use physical models, drawings and other physical 
media besides computers.”

Manovich added that the user interface of data-
bases like ARTstor proves visually unrepresentative of 
the wide amount of information it claims to provide.

“If a library or a social media site has hundreds of 
thousands of images, why can I only see a handful of 
them at a time?” he said. “Why aren’t they arranged 
in a grid?”

Manovich and his colleagues at the California 
Institute for Telecommunications and Information 
Technology are currently working on new designs for 
interfaces for database sites like ARTstor.

“We are starting to work on new kinds of inter-
faces for online image collections,” he said. “We are 
hoping to add much more functionality to current 
interfaces. Rather than using a computer as a fancy 
slide viewer, the computer can act as an intelligent 
assistant, which will help view image collections in 
new ways.”

Demolition of the A&AL and Film & Video 
Reserve spaces, located within Geisel Library, will 
commence in summer 2008. The A&AL slide collec-
tion will close on May 30.

FEDS KEEP

STOCKPILE 

IN PLACE

A.S. ELECTIONS 2008

By Peter Feytser
Senior Staff Writer

The federal government has 
decided not to follow through on 
a recent plan to move a stockpile of 
medical supplies from San Diego to 
Los Angeles County after the San 
Diego County Board of Supervisors 
submitted an official letter of pro-
test.

County officials voiced concern 
that, in the event of a disaster like 
the wildfires that raged through 
the San Diego area in October,  
emergency response time could be 
significantly delayed if the supplies 
were moved. They also said  that an 
earthquake scenario could damage

Beginning Monday, March 31, the 
East/Regents shuttle will resume its 
Price Center service. 

The East/Regents shuttle will no 
longer serve the Warren College and 
Geisel Library stops.

East/Regents Shuttle Returns to Price Center

the only two north-south routes 
into San Diego, Interstates 5 and 
15, preventing the transport of the 
supplies.

The supplies were used in the 
devastating 2003 and 2007 wild-
fires. Both interstates were closed 
during the fires in 2007.

Officials from the U.S. Department 
of Health and Human Services cited 
economic efficiency as their reason to 
relocate the supplies, saying that rent-
ing a warehouse in 
San Diego costs  
$40,000 a year. 

Jake Jacoby, 
UCSD Medical 
Center employee 
and commander 
of the federal 
Disaster Medical 
Assistance Team 
in San Diego, told 
the North County 
Times that mov-
ing the stock-
pile could make 
it more difficult for the team to 
respond quickly — and that it could 
be the first move toward eliminat-
ing the team itself. 

A primary objective of the 
DMAT is to provide support for 
swamped or evacuated hospitals.

The UCSD Medical Center is 
the primary sponsor of the local 
DMAT, charged with recruiting and 
training members as well as han-
dling basic administrative needs.

Davis (D-San Diego) discussed the 
issue with agency officials before 
the decision was reversed.

Assistant Secretary of DHHS Craig 
Vanderwagen said that agency will 
look into possibly storing the stock-
pile in a warehouse owned by the U.S. 
military or San Diego County.

“I’m very pleased that the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services has recognized the impor-
tance of keeping these critical sup-
plies in the San Diego area,” Bilbray 

said in a state-
ment. “By work-
ing together, I am 
optimistic that a 
suitable location 
will be found.”

Created in 
1991, the 12-ton 
cache includes 
cots, tents, defi-
brillators, ven-
tilators, genera-
tors and other 
equipment that 
is enough to treat 

150 to 250 patients a day for up to 
three days.

San Diego’s team is categorized 
as level one, which means that it is 
able to be activated and prepared 
for deployment within six to eight 
hours of request.

It was previously deployed to 
New York after the Sept. 11, 2001, 
terrorist attacks, New Orleans in 
the wake of Hurricane Katrina and 
Guam in the aftermath of a super 
typhoon.

language.”
Samia said he is pleased with 

this year’s candidate pool, but he 
emphasized a more long-term chal-
lenge that the slate-dominated sys-
tem presents: incorporating a wider 
set of voices.

“Everyone is fighting the fact 
that the majority of UCSD doesn’t 
care, and that makes the slates capa-
ble of dominating,” he said. “It takes 
a lot of knowledge and persistence 
to be on A.S. The students who are 
willing to do that are exemplary. In 
my experience with the candidates, 
I personally think they are going to 
do fabulous, but the criticism is that 
maybe A.S. really does keep this 
experience locked up.”

Bean said she does not plan to 
use the dearth of opponents as an 
excuse to decrease her campaign’s 
magnitude. She said she views her 
unique situation as an opportunity 
to build a strong mandate heading 
into her presidency. She is mov-
ing to gather input from student 
organizations and the public and to 
begin working toward her presiden-
tial goals immediately.

“As much as we’re all disap-
pointed, we can always turn it into 
something positive,” Bean said. “We 
can reach out and gauge student 
opinion and see what issues are 
important to them.”

She added that a lack of com-
petition does not mean an easy 
campaign.

“It’s going to make the job hard-
er, because I think people will be far 
more critical,” she said. “It’s a time 
for people to prove themselves.”

Given that this campus is widely 
recognized for its rigorous, broad-
ly based curricula, its accelerating 
rigidity in freshman selection and 
its continuous climb up the ladder 
in academic quality rankings, the 
A.S. Council should rally around a 
singular identity that has seemingly 
eluded the UCSD student body for 
so long. 

What UCSD needs is an iden-
tity focused on its commitment to 
produce the hardest working, most 
intellectually stimulated and most 
confident graduating body that the 

UC system has to offer. 
The A.S. Council must first work 

to promote such an identity. UCSD 
should become the CalTech of the 
UC system. 

In turn, developing such an image 
takes time. Yet, UCSD is already con-
sidered to be a top national contrib-
utor to important bodies of research, 
and is on par academically with UC 
Berkeley and UCLA. Additionally, 
the title “UCSD” increasingly con-
jures up images of a rigorous, prag-
matic and distraction-lacking aca-
demic experience. To emphasize and 
reinforce the notion that students 
should feel proud and privileged to 
be a Triton, the A.S. Council needs 

to maintain a stringent fund alloca-
tion requirement in order to ensure 
that research-oriented, potentially 
nationally competitive clubs receive 
more funding. The incoming coun-
cil should also consider processes 
targeted toward garnering more 
media attention by lobbying to host 
recognized academic conventions, 
which would provide an excellent 
basis for marketing efforts. 

The importance of a school 
identity is undeniable. Promoting a 
common, recognizable and enviable 
identity may be just the ticket.

Though few can put faces to the 
A.S. Council names, many under-
graduates are involved in at least one 
on-campus club. While candidates 
prepare for their campaigns, and for 
unopposed candidates their inevita-
ble election into office, they continue 
to ignore what is perhaps their great-
est resource: student organizations.

There is no better way for the 
council to connect with students 
than through the groups to which 
they belong. It’s in these organiza-
tions that incoming freshmen find 
friendly faces and learn to voice their 
concerns with the campus. However, 
if nobody with the power to propa-
gate change is listening, what’s the 
incentive? A better relationship with 
the personable organizations on the 
council’s part would strengthen stu-
dent enthusiasm for programming 
events, and in turn boost a signifi-
cantly weak school spirit.

Different organizations have 
equally varying relationships with the 
council; it appears this great divide is 
overarching. As of now, the only way 
for organizations to have a voice is by 
getting one of their members elected 
to the council. 

But this inside favoritism serves 
few students. Councilmembers 
should explore other ways to tap 
into the power of the campus’ clubs. 
What’s necessary is an institutional-
ized connection, where student gov-
ernment can effectively communi-
cate with all student organizations, 
and vice versa. The council’s focus is 
often behind the scenes and there-
fore invisible to most students, but in 
order to best serve its constituency 
the council should create an efficient 
line of communication with student 
club leaders that provides accurate 

information in a timely manner. This 
will open doors for more collabora-
tive projects.

The current council has made 
notable strides to better its relation-
ships with student organizations by 
reaching out to students with A.S. 
visibility weeks and streamlining 
bureaucratic procedures by mak-
ing them available online. With this 
groundwork in place, the incom-
ing council is poised to solidify the 
already germinating relationship. 

The A.S. Council is a fiscal crutch 
for organizations to lean on — and 
this will surely be another issue for 
the council in the coming year — but 
there are so many ways this connec-
tion could be improved. 

The council must use next year 
to explore other means of support 
for these organizations, outside of 
the wallet. For example, both bodies 
could benefit from improved public-
ity, which could lead to a generally 
stronger school spirit and a better 
campus climate. 

The current council is making 
progress in getting people from many 
different organizations involved so 
they can bring varied perspectives 
to the table. This progress is excit-
ing, but it ensures nothing for clubs 
currently uninvolved with student 
government. 

It is these campus clubs that con-
stantly engage and interact with stu-
dents. All the council needs to do is 
build upon this friendship, and voila 
— student life becomes exponentially 
better connected to the campus.

Idealistic as it is, hand in hand, the 
A.S. Council and student orgs could 
revive a UCSD school spirit that has 
become one of the most pressing con-
cerns of dissatisfied students.

It’s no secret: We attend UC 
Socially Dead. The problem doesn’t 
lie in a lack of events where stu-
dents can have fun and mingle. From 
Bear Gardens to TGIO concerts, A.S. 
Programming works hard to offer 
a variety of activities and concerts 
throughout the year. The problem 
lies in the attendance records of these 
events. With A.S. Council elections 
coming up, candidates should look 
at ways of improving event publicity 
and marketing in order to increase 
attendance.

According to last year’s UCSD 
Student Life Annual Report, 2,852 
students attended FallFest, less than 
half that went to WinterFest and the 
TGIO concerts had a total of 1,303 
attendees. When compared to the 
16,500 students who attended the 
Sun God Festival, it’s clear that these 
other events are missing the bar. 

This year’s council has sought 
to improve Sun God even more, by 

changing the layout and increasing 
the number of campus-sponsored 
activities. These changes look to 
enhance the festival’s already charged 
atmosphere; Sun God is the one day 
the campus really comes alive and 
students are out in full force. 

While A.S. Programming has 
taken an amazing first step this year, 
it will be up to the incoming coun-
cil to appoint a hardworking and 
innovative programming staff. If the 
council wants to support its events 
with bigger crowds, the events need 
to have almost the same status as Sun 
God. Luckily, the incoming council 
will inherit what looks like a well-
coordinated plan for future events. 
This year’s Sun God will lay the 
foundations for future growth. And 
by transforming the quarterly con-
certs into all-campus dances, A.S. 
Programming is working to bring 
FallFest and WinterFest up to par 
with Spring Quarter’s mayhem.

The incoming council is sitting 
pretty; all it needs to do is continue 
along this year’s path of innova-

tion, and expand publicity for these 
events.

Currently, events are advertised 
via Web sites, flyers and Facebook. 
This does a mediocre job of publicity 
and keeping students informed about 
the activities going on at UCSD, but 
there needs to be something more 
than simply telling the who, what, 
when and where of an event. The 
council should focus its efforts on 
reaching out to students to keep them 
excited and aware of opportunities 
— something that is also pivotal for 
success at this year’s revamped Sun 
God.

What’s most important is to build 
a stronger and more united UCSD 
community. The thing that makes 
Sun God so unique is that it brings 
together every student on campus. 
A.S Programming should only rest 
when it can get the same turnout 
and feeling of unity throughout the 
entire year.

Free speech should be a topic of heavy 
discussion on the A.S. Council floor next year, 
as it has received very little attention thus far. 
Revisions to campus policy on free speech 
and advocacy, as proposed by the adminis-
tration and e-mailed to students last June 
during finals week, divide the campus into 
free speech zones, require reservations for 
gatherings of 10 or more people and impose 
regulations on the political activity of faculty 
members.

In response, a 16-member committee, com-
posed of undergraduates, faculty and admin-
istrators, was formed to evaluate and rewrite 
the policies stipulated in the revisions in the 
interest of securing unabridged free speech. 

Current A.S. Vice President of External 
Affairs Dorothy Young has voiced support 
for the committee’s proposal, recommend-
ing that the council endorse it. Meanwhile, 
other councilmembers sit on the University 
Centers Advisory Board, which recently cre-
ated its own restrictive policy — it sweepingly 
prohibits gatherings that produce “excessive 
noise” — governing free speech in Price 
Center. 

Clearly, the A.S. Council is divided; dif-
ferences of opinion exist on any topic, but a 
threat to free speech must be handled with 
cohesive student unity.

The incoming council must bring to the 

floor an all-encompassing debate concern-
ing what free speech rights students have. 
It must send a strong message to students 
alerting them, on a large scale, of its stance on 
the implications of any policy revisions. The 
administration revealed the changes last June, 
leaving all new freshmen and transfer students 
in the dark, but the current council has done 
nothing to inform these students of the recent 
alterations to their rights.

When the elections pass and the council 
transitions to its new form, student leaders 
need to discuss free speech openly with any 
student or staff member willing to participate, 
and reach a consensus. 

The council is the only group with enough 
representative breadth across the student pop-
ulation to make a significant difference in how 
the situation will play out. If the council con-
solidates a stance on free speech, and brings 
this stance to the mass attention of the stu-
dent body, the debate becomes less between 
advisory boards and revision committees, and 
more between concerned students and an 
administration keen to strip away constitu-
tional rights. 

And most importantly, with a united stu-
dent voice, the debate’s end result is far more 
likely to be in the favor of students’ civil rights 
than what the administration deems allow-
able.

As incoming class sizes grow, on-campus 
parking has becoming increasingly crowded 
and chaotic. The issue arises from the irrec-
oncilable gap between students’ demand for 
more accessible parking and transportation 
and environmentalists’ desire to reduce the 
usage of carbon-emitting automobiles. 

Even though UCSD Transportation & 
Parking Services reported that there are over 
1,000 empty parking spaces even during peak 
hours, the problem of accessible student park-
ing — that is, not faculty, graduate student or 
visitor spaces — still remains. And with peri-
odic talk of a new parking structure, which 
would in turn drive up permit prices, the new 
council  will definitely need to focus its energy 
on helping students navigate the muddled 
parking confusion. 

Students rushing to class don’t have time 
to guess which parking lot has an empty spot 
waiting for them. But there’s no easy solution 
for this obvious overcrowding. Instead, the 
council should help promote a more envi-
ronmentally friendly alternative: using public 
transportation. 

The overcrowding of UCSD shuttles at 
peak hours, coupled with the recent trunca-
tion of city bus routes in various areas,  leaves 
students facing a lack of reliable public trans-
portation. This is why the council should 
work with T&PS to design the most efficient 

routes for students, while keeping the Earth 
in mind.

Environmental concerns have already 
prompted T&PS to purchase electric vehicles 
for on-campus use and to begin replacing 
current shuttles with alternative-fuel powered 
shuttles, in addition to sponsoring bike-rid-
ing initiatives — a few major steps in UCSD’s 
contribution to sustainability and the environ-
ment. 

But students’ everyday commuting needs 
still must be considered. A decrease in the use 
of cars must be accompanied with alternative 
methods for commuting students. Replacing 
shuttles with environmentally friendly fuel 
sources does not improve the reliability of 
public transportation.

The solution lies in providing efficient 
and convenient alternatives to car use that 
are also environmentally friendly.  T&PS can 
maximize efficiency through better distribu-
tion and organization of the different types 
of parking spaces — why are all the student 
spaces being moved from the heart of campus 
to lots on the school’s outer rim? 

The burden falls on the A.S. Council to 
lobby for these student interests. Incoming 
councilmembers must take into account both 
the students’ practical commuting needs and 
the pressing concern of environmental pres-
ervation.

Usually one of the more imposing 
structures on campus, it’s pretty hard 
not to envy the well-equipped Student 
Union buildings at UCLA and UC 
Berkeley. These bigger, better cousins 
of our Price Center boast travel agen-
cies, haircut salons, arcades, 24-hour 
study lounges and, most envy worthy, a 
wide variety of inexpensive restaurants 
that stay open late.

Now, with the new expansion of 
Price Center and other parts of cam-
pus, UCSD is taking a step in the 
right direction. Our answer to UCLA 
and UC Berkeley’s Student Unions 
will grow to include more restaurants, 

study lounges, a nightclub and other 
exciting additions, making way for the 
more tight-knit and community-cen-
tric campus that the administration has 
always wanted to create. These sorts 
of improvements (that we pay a small 
fortune for, of course) will be key to 
augmenting UCSD’s notoriously low 
morale, and in the process, might actu-
ally facilitate Triton solidarity.

The new construction is encourag-
ing, but there is still a lot more room 
for expansion and improvement of 
Price Center. The A.S. Council will 
be moving into new offices with the 
expansion’s completion, but let’s hope 
councilmembers take a walk outside 
and start to use the new space for better 
activities to unify the campus. 

We need everything we can get to 
overcome this frustratingly spread-out 
campus and push for developments that 
will make Price Center that nexus of 
activity and student convenience we’ve 
always dreamed of. UCSD may shut 
down at 4:30 p.m., but student needs 
do not operate on a nine-to-five basis. 
Let’s keep the momentum going for 
a more student-adapted Price Center 
that compensates for the embarrassing 
dearth of things to do in La Jolla. Forget 
Spirit Night — the key to Tritons’ hearts 
lies in the availability and convenience 
of on-campus services, restaurants and 
events. Let’s make it happen.

Price Center Expansion the Perfect Opportunity to Enhance Student Life

THE STUDENT OUTLOOK
FOCUS

B rittan Trozzi, a 2001 alumna and self-proclaimed poster child for UCSD, swears that she would bleed blue and gold if you 
cut her arm off. Under the direction of the UCSD 
Alumni Association, for which she serves as 
Student-Alumni Programs Manager, Trozzi and 
her colleagues strive to cultivate this same prided 
culture to reconnect alumni to the university and  
elevate alumni presence on campus. This push 
for pride is coupled with the recent revamp of 
alumni programs intended to increase member-
ship and donations.

Creating a strong connection to the univer-
sity is something other campus entities, like the 
A.S. Council, are continually trying to achieve. 
But the Alumni Association, realizing that stu-
dent disconnect may negatively impact current 
and potential membership and fiscal support, 
has recently made this its issue as well, and this 
new focus may explain minor improvement in 
membership numbers.

Currently, the UCSD Alumni Association has 
8,067 contributing members registered, up from 
7,200 members in January 2006. Approximately 
5,121 alumni donated $1.8 million to the uni-
versity last year. This year, 466 first-time alumni 
donors have already contributed to UCSD, dem-
onstrating some growth, according to Director 
of Development Communications Judy Piercey. 
These donations have become increasingly 
important, because only 12 percent of the uni-
versity’s annual revenue comes from the state, 
according to Executive Director of Development 
Harrie Hughes. 

Despite the slight progress, UCSD’s alumni 
contributions are eclipsed by more established 
universities like UCLA, which received roughly 
$64 million from 5 percent of its 87,000 Alumni 
Association members last year. Aside from hav-
ing a 41-year advantage in establishing both 
school-instituted events like Spring Sing and 
student-instituted traditions like the Undie-Run, 
UCLA’s Alumni Association is heavily involved 
in student life from day one. Alumni members 
make calls to incoming freshmen, and a tour of 
the James West Alumni Center is a vital compo-
nent of freshmen orientation, according to Brian 
Logue, director of membership for UCLA’s 
Alumni Association.

Overall trends 
for alumni donations to the 

UC system, however, have decreased 
1.8 percent, according to Piercey, and UCSD’s 
Alumni Association is taking steps to boost 
membership and philanthropic support. This 
support accounted for over $17 million of the 
$1-billion “Imagine What’s Next” campaign and 
helped fund 40 percent of faculty research efforts 
and 33 percent of academic programs and facili-
ties, according to Piercey.  

Executive Director for the Alumni Association 
Armin Afsahi hopes to promote support by 
making the Alumni Association a visible part 
of campus life through its new location in the 
renovated Price Center. This move will allow 
the association to be a more active force in the 
student experience by simply being in the center 
of campus activity.

“We really expect Price Center to be a draw for 
alumni to come back and check out what’s been 
changing and expanding,” Trozzi said. “Really 
successful universities have that alumni home 
and we get to build our home now.”

The new Price Center, according to UCSD 
alumna Nicole Vargas, will help remedy the 
socially stunted environment she experienced as 
a student. For Vargas, Price Center’s renovation is 
positive proof that the university is acknowledg-
ing the social aspect of college life and making 
it easier for students to find a social outlet after 
hours of dedicated study.

With a physical home in the works, the Alumni 
Association is partnering with Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Penny Rue, working to instill an 
emotional attachment between the university, 
students and alumni through stronger campus 
traditions. On March 1, the Alumni Association 
co-sponsored and co-funded a retreat where 
seven alumni members and a handful of current 
students brainstormed new ideas for traditions 
— potential threads to tie students and alumni 
together in a shared experience.

“Happy students; engaged students with great 
positive experiences become great alumni of the 
institution,” Afsahi said. “That’s why we’re thrilled 
with [Vice] Chancellor Rue’s arrival because she 
has it as her mission to create a strong student 
experience for every student and to make sure 
alumni are visible in that experience.”

The Alumni Association is also encouraging 
alumni to donate more than their money. Because 
68 percent of UCSD alumni are under the age of 

40, according to Piercey, it is difficult to expect 
the type of fiscal support more established uni-

versities like UCLA 
— which have older 
alumni — receive. 

According to Trozzi, 
potential members may 

feel that because they cannot 
contribute financially, they 
shouldn’t join. The Alumni 
Association provides these 
young alumni with revived 
programs to get them to share 
their time and resources in 
lieu of their money.

“We don’t necessarily think 
everyone can only donate 

money,” Afsahi said. “Sometimes 
what people think about when 

they think of an alumni association 
is, ‘you just want our money, stop 

calling me.’”
The association stresses a particular 

part of its moniker “time, talent and 
treasure,” empha-

szing that an 
alumni’s “time” 
and “talent” are 

just as valuable 
as their “treasure.” 

R e v a m p e d 
s t u d e n t - a l u m n i 
programs include Triton 
Tables and Life 101. 
Triton Tables, a pro-
gram that has been 
hosted sporadi-
cally since 2005, 
will now regularly 
occur one weekend 
a quarter and will 
be themed. Students 
can now choose which 
event they would like 
to attend based on the 
themes, instead of being 
assigned to a certain table. 
Between Feb. 29 and March 2, 
alumni had the opportunity to enhance their 
connection to UCSD by inviting current students 
into their homes for a social dinner. Topics at the 
March 2 Triton Tables dinner, hosted by Vargas 
and UCSD alumni Eric Viglotti, ranged from 
internship opportunities for sports writers to 
UCSD urban legends.

“I love meeting students,” Vargas said. “I really 
think it’s important to build a network and to see 
someone who survived [college].” 

Although it has existed for four years, Life 
101 has been altered to provide students with 
the same chance to speak with alumni, and 
alumni with another occasion to reconnect with 
the university. The Life 101 program will host a 
“Networking with the Pros” event on April 30 
that will bring 50 alumni from different indus-
tries back to campus to answer career-specific 
questions for current students. 

These programs are specifically designed to 
promote student-alumni interaction in the hopes 
that students will graduate having an understand-
ing of the value of alumni-university connections 
and will thus be willing to come back and give, 
Afsahi said. Additionally, for current alumni who 
did not have access to these programs when they 
were students, there are alumni-related avenues in 
place to entice them to return to the university.

For alumni unable to physically return to 
the university, there is the “UCSD Near You” 
program. This nationwide tour stops at 10 cities 
from San Diego to Boston, and recently brought 
600 alumni together. The Alumni Association 
also funds 16 regional chapters led by volun-
teers, 12 affinity groups and five constituent 
chapters — including the Black Alumni Chapter, 
Staff Alumni Chapter, Chicano-Hispanic Alumni 
Chapter, American-Indian Alumni Chapter and 
the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual Alumni Chapter — all 
of which connect alumni with one another.

“Our largest goal is to make sure that UC San 
Diego remains relevant in [alumni] lives and then 
they can make the best decisions on how that 
relevance is translated,” Afsahi said.

While alumni membership has increased 
slowly in the past two years, monetary support 
still falls below what the Alumni Association 
desires, according to Afsahi. 

Alumni donations and participation are con-
tingent upon feeling connected to the university, 
Trozzi said. She added that students who feel con-
nected to the university while they attend will 
undoubtedly feel the same passion once they have 
graduated.

“Other universities that have exemplary alum-
ni programs are those where there’s a buzz across 
the world among their alumni,” Afsahi said. “We 
think UC San Diego is an amazing place and 
we’re creating that buzz.”

San Diegans Shocked by Circus at Giza Zoo
Welcomed to the gates by a lush, green garden sculpture depicting an 
elephant, visitors to the San Diego 
Zoo are prepared to enter one of the 
world’s most renowned and progres-
sive animal habitats. It is also one of 
the most expansive, stretching over 
100 acres of San Diego real estate. 
The cost of entrance: $33 — the “best 
value” rate.

U s h e r e d 
in through an 
immense green 
gate, flanked 
on either side 
by etched stone 
giraffes, visitors 
to the Giza Zoo 
in Cairo can enjoy 
the once fourth-ranked zoo in the 
world, also mapped at 100 acres, for 
one Egyptian pound, or 18 American 
cents.

Idyllic walking trails for guests 
and spacious living accommodations 
for residents have put the San Diego 
Zoo ahead of many around the world. 
It is known not only for its educa-
tional aspect and mission to inform 
the public, but as a leader in conser-
vation and protection of endangered 
species. The zoo has been pivotal in  
breeding and reintroduction efforts 
for the California Condor and the 
African Black Rhino. It is even more 
famous for raising the first Panda 
cubs born in the United States.

Most of the animals are trans-
ferred between the zoo and the Wild 
Animal Park, which operates under 
the same management. Entrance fee 
proceeds go to maintaining animals 
and locations, education programs, 
research and conservation efforts. 

The Giza Zoo’s income doesn’t 
even cover upkeep costs, but remains 
low to allow residents and tourists of 
all incomes a chance to experience 
everything the facility has to offer. 
The zoo houses an extensive breed-

ing facility, where the first California 
Sea Lion was born in the Middle 
East, and a fully operational taxi-
dermist. Nevertheless, the zoo staff ’s 
focus is less about education as it is 
about entertainment.

The green gardens and wide 
walkways of the Giza Zoo contrast 
the crowded and urban landscape 
of Cairo. Even on Friday, the first 
day of the Egyptian weekend and 

Muslim holy day, 
the zoo is less 
crowded than its 
San Diegan coun-
terpart on the 
slowest of days. 

While the San 
Diego zoo wel-
comes visitors to 

snap photos of the resting, frolicking 
or pacing creatures, the Giza Zoo 
prohibits guests to enter with their 
personal cameras. But this rule, like 
so many others in Cairo, is flexible 
and laxly enforced.

Another practice that sets the 
Giza Zoo apart from the San Diego 
Zoo is the proximity with which 
tourists or guests can find themselves 
from the animals. The San Diego 
Zoo is a pioneer in building cage-less 
exhibits; at the Giza Zoo visitors can 
stand mere feet from lions, tigers and 
bears, separated from the confines 
of their tiny cells by only a few steel 
bars. 

At the sea lion cage, a member 
of the zoo staff gave a long stick to a 
young child, which he then used to 
feed the excitable animal a meager 
chunk of fish. The sea lion, flinging 
itself against the cage and stuffing 
its face into the holes of a rusty 
cyclone fence, likely spent its entire 
day in that same predicament. The 
kids can’t seem to get enough.

Walking past the bears, Earl 
Warren College seniors Wesley 
Horne, Meaghan Beatty and I all 
paused. One small black bear with 

a bald spot and dangling tongue 
was raking its head along the bars 
in brain-damaged fashion. Another 
group squealed and cried out as zoo-
keepers splashed a large barrel of 
what looked like oatmeal into the 
center of the cage. The bears attacked 
the food ravenously. At the far end of 
the complex a small boy nearly lost a 
hand as he spoon-fed a lone member 
of the exhibit.

One elephant garnered similar 
treatment; a crowd waited at the 
edge of the gate to hand his wander-
ing trunk leaves and lettuce. Masses 
of baby crocodiles flooded across 
small, glass enclosed caverns in the 
reptile center and a sign outside, 
surely meant to prevent reoccur-
rence of past mishaps, asked visitors 
to refrain from catching the animals.

By the time we reached the lion 
exhibits we had managed to attract 
the attention of a zoo photographer, 
eager to show us everything the zoo 
had to offer. Without even stopping 
outside the cages, we were whisked 
into the off-limits area and the feline 
backroom.

We had heard there was a good 
chance we could hold baby lions, 
chimpanzees or really do just about 
anything we wanted with them. Still, 
when we were handed the cubs and 
asked to kneel, pose and smile, it felt 
a little uncomfortable — not because 
claws were digging into my leg or 
because the cameraman insisted that 
next we would stand with our back 
to a full-grown tiger as another man 
dangled food above us to distract it 
from reaching through the bars. No, 
I felt uncomfortable because I have 
grown up with the kind of qual-
ity and environment the San Diego 
Zoo offers animals, and even then 
thought the idea of zoos to be a bit 
perverse.

We walked out and tipped the 
zookeeper about $10. The pictures 
cost a pretty penny more. As soon as 

we had them in hand we left, unable 
to spend anymore time wandering 
the grounds. 

I felt bad about the zoo’s condi-
tions, especially about the mistreat-
ment of the animals. I was annoyed 
that they were treated so poorly so 
the staff could make a little money, 
but I guess that is the problem. How 

can the quality of care for animals 
go up, when the quality of life for 
those who care for them depends on 
the circus sideshow of the Giza Zoo 
in Cairo?

10 SPORTS THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, MARCH 10, 2008

By Jake Blanc
Senior Staff Writer

FENCING — For the first time in his-
tory, UCSD’s fencing team will be send-
ing six fencers to Columbus, Ohio from 
March 13 to March 16 for the NCAA’s 
National Championships. UCSD, 
which was represented at nationals by 
only two players last season, qualified 
five of its fencers with outright bids at 
the NCAA West Regional on March 1 
and had its sixth fencer gain a wild card 
spot for the national championship.

By taking either first or second 
place at the regional championships, 
five Tritons immediately received invi-
tations to the national competition. At 
regionals, which took place at Cal State 
Fullerton, freshman Benjamin Dorn, 
senior Emily Lipoma and sophomore 
Florence Lee all finished the foil com-
petition in the top two, with Dorn 
and Lipoma taking first place. In epee, 
senior Chelsea Ambort and sophomore 
Heather Stephenson finished one-two, 
both earning bids to nationals. UCSD 
left regionals with five fencers heading 
to Ohio but was rewarded later in the 
week when it was informed that sopho-
more sabrist Bryan Kim had received 
one of only two wild card bids given in 
the entire country.

“I had written it off that I wasn’t 
going to nationals so I was just trying 
to reflect on the good season that I 

had,” Kim said. “Then I got called up 
and found out I was in the running for 
one of two wild cards but I still tried 
to stay calm and not get too excited. 
When I got the second call and found 
out I was going to nationals I was 
overjoyed.”

Presenting such a large contingent 
of fencers at the national championship 
is new territory for head coach Heidi 
Runyan, but a welcomed experience. 

“I was hoping to qualify four and 
to have six qualify is icing on the cake,” 
Runyan said. “It will be a very, very 
tough competition. Chelsea Ambort is 
the only one who has NCAA Nationals 
experience, and she is one of the top 
women epeeists in the country. The 
other five are first-timers to nationals 
and they will be under the radar. It will 
be a mistake for their competitors to 
underestimate them.”

Although the Tritons will show up at 
nationals with more fencers than usual, 
they will still have to face off against 
schools that qualify whole squads of 
fencers. The format consists of both a 
team competition and an individual 
tally, with the points of each fencer also 
going toward their team total. UCSD 
will be at a disadvantage in the team 
contest due to the huge numbers of 
fencers that certain schools have quali-
fied, but will be able to stay competitive 
on an individual scale. 

“When we are at nationals we will 

just have to be mentally prepared 
for the most intense two days ever,” 
Ambort said. “We will be fencing 23 
people in two days and there is no 
doubt that won’t matter. Every touch 
counts and so we have to be ready for 
every one. Staying sharp like that is 
very mentally and physically grueling, 
we will be exhausted after the first day 
and will have to go back and do it again 
on day two.”

The level of competition that the 
Tritons will face will be a new experi-
ence for all but Ambort. For the first-
time qualifiers, the chance to prove 
themselves against the best fencers 
offers career-defining moments.

“It pretty much reads as a ‘who’s 
who’ of the fencers that have dominat-
ed the sport the past few years so there’s 
a high likelihood that if I don’t fence 
well, they’re going to eat me alive,” Kim 
said. “I just need to try and stay relaxed 
and have some fun.”

The meet will be held the weekend 
immediately before finals week, but the 
Tritons, who have been training hard 
toward nationals all year, feel prepared.

“Some of us, especially the seniors, 
have been preparing for this since 
we were freshmen,” Ambort said. “I 
am very confident that we will have a 
strong showing in Ohio.”

championship game. The two teams 
split their games against each other in 
the regular season and were poised for 
a tight contest.

The Seawolves came out of the gates 
strong, taking a 22-13 lead with 6:36 left 
in the half. UCSD closed out the half 
on a 12-4 run to head into the break 
with some momentum. Sophomore 
forward Erin Noonan’s three-pointer 
with four seconds left in the half cut 
Sonoma State’s lead to 26-25.

“It was the third time we played 
them and we knew it was going to be 
tough,” Gaskin said. “We were able to 
stay together even when they started 
to pull away.”

The battle continued throught the 
second half. UCSD used the three-ball 
to keep pace with the Seawolves, as 
Noonan and Noud took turns convert-
ing from long range. With 1:45 left, 
Gaskin’s layup evened the score at 54. 
The last two minutes of the game would 
determine who would be playing for 
the conference championship.  

After taking a 56-55 lead on a layup 
from Noud, Osier came up with a key 
steal to help the Tritons hold on and 
win the contest. 

Senior center Diahnn Futalan was 
the only player off the bench to receive 

significant playing time and all of the 
Tritons’ points came from their five 
starters. Noud led the team with 19 
points, while Noonan added 13 points 
and Osier contributed 12 points.

“It was a really tough game because 
in the playoffs, every team steps it up 
a notch,” said Noud who, along with 
Osier, gained CCAA All-tournament 
honors. “We battled it out until the end 
and that’s why we won.”

Triton players said they hoped 
that their experience from last season, 
when they made it all the way to the 
Elite Eight, will help them in their 
first round matchup in the NCAA 
Tournament. 

“When you go in to the tourna-
ment for the first time, you have nerves 
and jitters,” Gaskin said. “We definitely 
have a lot of experience and we have an 
idea of what it’s like playing against top 
teams on a neutral court.”

UCSD will take on fifth-seeded Cal 
State San Bernardino in a first-round 
game on March 14. The Tritons swept 
the season series from the Coyotes and 
will look for their third win against 
them this year, this time with much 
more on the line.

MONDAY, MARCH 10, 2008 THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPORTS  11

other end, Patterson came up with 
a steal and drew a foul. Patterson 
hit 1-of-2 to again extend UCSD to 
a two-possession lead. Junior guard 
Kelvin Kim then set up an Allard 
trey on the next UCSD possession, 
extending the lead to seven as the 
Triton crowd at the Coussoulis 
Arena erupted into cheers. The 
Broncos could get no closer than 
five points through the game’s 
final five minutes, as junior for-
ward Andrew Hatch drew the fifth 
and final foul against Tsagarakis, 
Cal Poly Pomona’s leading three-
point shooter, with 1:16 remaining. 
Lawlor, Allard, Hatch and Patterson 
combined to go 6-of-8 from the line 
in the final minute to hold on for 
the biggest win in program history.

“It’s definitely a milestone in 
the history of UCSD,” Lawley said. 
“We’re setting a tone for future years 
and definitely trying to build a lega-
cy here. It’s big for our team, big for 
our confidence in the near future. 
We’re really riding high right now.”

As a team, the Tritons commit-
ted only 10 turnovers while pick-
ing up seven steals. UCSD also 
out-rebounded the larger Broncos 
squad and converted 10-of-21 field 
goal attempts in each half, along 
with 73.1 percent of its free-throw 
opportunities. The Tritons also held 
Gordon, Cal Poly Pomona’s leading 
scorer and the CCAA’s second-lead-
ing scorer, to five points below his 
season average. UCSD had four play-
ers score in double digits: Patterson 
led the way with a game-high 17 
points and tying Kim for the team 
high with four assists; Lawley added 
14 points; Allard chipped in with 11; 
and Lawlor recorded a double-dou-
ble with 11 points and 10 rebounds. 
Patterson, Lawley and Allard were 
also selected to the CCAA All-
Tournament Team, with Patterson 
named Tournament MVP. 

“It’s incredible,” Patterson said. 

“This being my last year here play-
ing, it’s do-or-die. We stepped up 
to the challenge. People thought 
we couldn’t do it. We dug ourselves 
a little hole, but we dug ourselves 
right back out. I just can’t even 
describe it, it’s one of the greatest 
feelings I’ve ever had. I’m happy to 
win with this group of guys; we get 
along so well. I love these guys.”

The Tritons quickly displayed 
their renewed momentum in the 
semifinals against San Francisco 
State; a team that beat them twice 
during the season. UCSD jumped 
out to another 10-point advantage 
less than five and a half minutes in 
and led by 20, 28-8, with 7:17 left in 
the first half. UCSD shot an incredi-
ble 61.5 percent in the first half with 
an amazing 14 assists on 16 baskets, 
while holding the Gators to below 
40-percent shooting and taking a 
39-24 advantage into the half. 

The Gators did not go away easi-
ly in the second half, applying a full-
court press with over 13 minutes 
remaining and cutting the Triton 
lead to five points, 56-51, with 7:35 
left in the game.

“I knew that any game could be 
my last,” Allard, who is a fifth-year 
senior, said. “I think all the seniors 
played like that, and the underclass-
men all had our back. Everyone 
that’s coming back next year, they 
knew how much it meant to us 
seniors and they went all out.”

Sophomore forward Andrew 
Browning was the first Triton to 
respond, completing a layup that 
pushed the lead back to seven. 
Patterson then scored six straight 
points for UCSD and after a San 
Francisco State three, Allard’s steal 
led to a Kim layup that put UCSD 
up by nine with 2:06 remaining in 
regulation. Allard and Lawlor each 
scored three straight UCSD points in 
the final minutes to seal the win and 
their place in the tournament finale.

The Tritons shot 60 percent from 

the field and took only six three-
pointers in the game, converting 
four of them. UCSD also collected 
22 total assists, with Kim setting a 
career high of nine and Allard add-
ing eight. 

“We were on a five-game skid 
coming into [the CCAA Tournament] 
and we just realized that we had 
to turn something around,” Lawley 
said. “We made a complete 180 and 
came ready to play all three games in 
the tournament.”

Patterson, the only Triton scoring 
in double digits with a game-high 22 
points on 8-of-10 field goal shooting 
and 6-of-8 from the line, pointed to 
the optimistic outlook and philoso-
phy of first-year head coach Carlson 
as a big reason for success.

“Coach Carlson is just so posi-
tive,” he said. “Even if we mess up, 
he’s still there, encouraging us to be 
better. Never gets down on us, never 
negative, and I think that helps a lot 
in terms of player development and 
confidence.”

Carlson, who left UCLA as 
director of basketball operations to 
begin his first head coaching stint, 
pointed to the efforts of his senior 
leadership.

“Clint Allard, Henry Patterson, 
Andrew Hatch, Jon Ward, Jason Bull 
— all our seniors have provided 
great leadership, both on and off 
the court,” he said. “Jon Ward and 
Jason Bull, they don’t play, but those 
guys are good teammates and they 
play very hard at practice and they 
make everyone else work hard. That 
senior group provides great leader-
ship for us, and they should be very 
proud of their efforts.”

UCSD’s next destination will be 
revealed during the NCAA Division 
II Selection Show on Sunday evening, 
with the West Regionals expected to 
begin on Friday, March 14.

town rivals San Diego State and the 
University of San Diego. The women 
placed first with 217.5 overall points, 
just enough to beat out second-place 
SDSU’s 204. The men were able to win 
with more breathing room, as their 
193.5 points were more than enough 
to edge out Point Loma Nazarene 
University’s 134.5.

Johnson’s leap of 19’2” in the 
long jump and junior Sarah Hendy’s 
throw of 158’4” 
in the discus 
were both good 
enough to earn 
automatic quali-
fication for the 
NCAA National 
Championships 
in May. The 
Triton women 
also received 
five provisional 
national quali-
fiers, includ-
ing two from 
sophomore hur-
dler Christine 
Merrill, whose 
times in the 100- and 400-meter 
hurdles of 14.46 and 1:02.21, respec-
tively, were also good enough to get 
her first place, beating a very tal-
ented Aztec hurdling team. 

“It was a really good day for every-
one, which got me excited,” Merrill 
said. “Since the whole team was run-
ning well, it made me concentrate 
really hard. The success definitely 
carried over from All-Cal last week-
end; the momentum really helped. 
The whole team works really well 
together, we all get each other excited 
to compete; we are really like a big 
family.”

On the men’s side, the team won 
12 of the 18 scored events, with Nick 
Morilla’s throw of 15.54 in the shot-

put both winning the day’s event 
and going down as the third best 
throw in UCSD history. Although the 
Triton women occasionally get more 
attention than the men, both squads 
merited the same amount of praise 
with their performance at the SD City 
Championships. 

“You can’t really slight the men’s 
performance,” Salerno said. “They 
are really good and it’s unfortunate 
that sometimes the women, who are 

normally ranked 
first or second in 
the nation, over-
shadow them. The 
men are top 20 in 
the nation and to 
come against these 
teams here and be 
pretty much domi-
nant is impressive.”

The UCSD 
women have now 
beat five Division-
I teams in the past 
two weeks, proving 
that they are truly 
the country’s best 
Division-II squad. 

A key ingredient to the team’s suc-
cess is a balanced roster, which is full 
of athletes that can step up on any 
given day. 

“This season we can probably 
expect a lot of new people to step into 
the limelight,” Johnson said. “There 
are definitely not just a few stars on 
the team. Anyone can have a massive 
breakthrough at any given meet. As 
a team, we just need to stay united, 
stay consistent and stay focused on 
each goal.”

UCSD will next travel down the 
road to the Aztec Invitational, hosted 
by SDSU on March 14 and 15.

HOT CORNER

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — The 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association defending champion 
UCSD women’s basketball team fell 
just short of a repeat this year with 
a close loss to No. 18 Chico State in 
the conference championship game on 
March 8. The game slipped away from 
the Tritons in the last few minutes, 
ending in a frustrating 69-63 loss to 
the Wildcats.

UCSD’s postseason hopes are very 
much alive, however, as they were given 
a No. 4 seed in the West Regional of the 
NCAA Division II Tournament. 

UCSD made it to the conference 
championship game by winning a 
close semifinal match against Sonoma 
State University on March 7 by a score 
of 57-55. After losing to the Wildcats, 
the Tritons must wait and see if they 
will be selected to the eight-team West 
Regional tournament that will take 
place March 14-17. 

The championship game was close 
from the beginning, with the teams 
tying four times in the opening five 
minutes. With the game tied at 8 and 
14:28 left in the half, junior forward 
Michelle Osier’s three-point basket 
started a 14-0 run by the Tritons, giv-
ing them a 22-8 lead. 

The Wildcats answered back, capi-
talizing on every turnover and missed 
shot to chip away at the Tritons’ lead. 
Chico State’s last-second layup cut 
the Tritons lead to 32-27, pulling the 
Wildcats to within five points by the 
half.

“We knew it was going to be a 
tough game since we split our games 

with Chico this season, winning the 
game that we played at home,” senior 
center Alexis Gaskin said. 

Gaskin started off the second-
half scoring with two straight bas-
kets, extending UCSD’s lead to 36-27. 
The Wildcats continued to fight back, 
finally erasing the Tritons’ lead and 
tying the game at 43 with 11:02 left in 
regulation.

But the Tritons quickly regained 
the lead, and seemed to be in control 
of the game, holding a 56-49 lead with 
6:36 left in the half. Continuing a pat-
tern that held true for the entire game, 
the Wildcats responded, this time tak-
ing a 62-61 lead with three minutes 
left after converting on a three-point 
attempt. 

Gaskin’s jump shot with 1:31 gave 
the Tritons a one-point lead, but that 
would be the last Triton points of the 
game. With the Wildcats hitting all 
their remaining shots and Tritons not 
able to convert on their final attempts, 
the Wildcats were able to pull out the 
69-63 win. 

Senior forward Meaghan Noud 
led all scorers with 21 points, while 
Osier added 14 points for the Tritons. 
Sophomore guard Annette Ilg scored 11 
points off the bench and Gaskin added 
eight points and seven rebounds.

“I’m proud of how we played,” 
Noud said. “We fought hard against a 
team that is ranked pretty high in our 
region. We showed that we are capable 
of playing with them until the end.”

TRACK AND FIELD — With only 
three meets completed in the early 
2008 season, the UCSD track and 
field team proved that this year will 
be one for the record books. After 
opening their season at the annual 
Rossi Relays, the Tritons traveled to 
Irvine for the All-Cal Championships 
on March 1 and turned in one of the 
best days in school history. At the 
meet, the women’s team took first 
place for the first time ever and the 
men finished in a very close third. 
The Tritons topped their All-Cal per-
formance with both the men and 
women dominating their competi-
tion on March 8 at the San Diego City 
Championships. 

As the marquee event one month 
into the season, the All-Cal meet 
traditionally draws some of the best 
competition on the West Coast and 
this year played host to fellow UC 
and Division-I schools in UC Santa 
Barbara, Riverside, Irvine and Davis. 

“The All-Cal win was a huge 
breakthrough performance for 
our team,” senior jumper Whitney 
Johnson said. “We have come so close 
to the top in the past years at All-Cal. 
I believe we made a very strong state-
ment that day, and, proved just how 
big of a threat UCSD is, regardless of 
the division we are in. We finally set 
the record straight.”

Head coach Tony Salerno viewed 
the All-Cal win as a milestone in the 
track and field program and predict-
ed that his team will only continue to 
build off of its success.

“I would rate this win ahead of any 
of our [California Collegiate Athletics 
Association] Championships or our 
eighth place finish at nationals last 

year,” Salerno said. “To get those 
numbers this early in March is some-
thing really special. We’re in a really 
good place right now.”

As if the win at All-Cal wasn’t 
enough, the Tritons returned home 

this past weekend to host the SD 
City Championships and took yet 
another first-place finish over a field 
that included powerhouse cross-

UCSD Gets NCAA Berth 
After League Finals Loss

MEN’S BASKETBALL — “We set our goals at the begin-
ning of the season: CCAA Championship,” junior forward 
Darryl Lawlor said. “To win it, it’s like a dream come 
true.” 

The UCSD men’s basketball team’s dream did indeed 
come true on March 8, as the Tritons completed a memora-
ble underdog journey by securing the program’s first-ever 
California Collegiate Athletic Association Championship 
and berth in the National Collegiate Athletic Association 
Division II Tournament.

The Tritons were seeded eighth in the West Region 
amd will face top-seeded University of Alaska Anchorage  
in the first round on March 15.

Entering the CCAA Tournament as the seventh seed 
after closing out the regular season on a five-game skid, 
UCSD followed an upset over No. 2 seed and host school 
Cal State San Bernardino with a 72-65 win against San 
Francisco State on March 7 and a 64-56 victory over Cal 
Poly Pomona in the tournament final on March 8. The 
Tritons, having improved their Division II-best record to 
18-11 on the season, will now move on to the NCAA D-II 
West Regional Quarterfinals.

“If you don’t believe you’re going to win the CCAA 
Championship, then you won’t do it,” senior guard Clint 
Allard said. “Every one of our guys believed we had a 
shot at it. On any given night, we can beat anybody. We 
had the preparation and we played as hard as we could.”

The Tritons’ preparation was on display early against 
Cal Poly Pomona. After Pomona’s Rich Collins opened 
the scoring by nailing a three-pointer on the first 
Broncos possession, three-pointers from sophomore 
guard Jordan Lawley, Lawlor and Allard keyed a 13-0 
UCSD run. Having trailed the Broncos by double digits 
early on in both of this season’s previous meetings, the 
Tritons held their own 10-point advantage less than six 
minutes into the game. 

While demonstrating the sharp shooting that made 
UCSD the conference’s second-best three-point field goal 
shooting team, the Tritons’ fourth-ranked defense was 
also on display, holding Cal Poly Pomona below 10 points 
for the first 11 minutes of the game. Angelo Tsagarakis’ 
three first half three-pointers kept the Broncos close, 
with the third cutting the Tritons’ advantage to four 
with under five minutes in the half. Lawlor responded 
for UCSD on the next possession, drawing the foul 
against Tsagarakis and hitting both free throw attempts. 
Following a three-pointer from Cal Poly Pomona, UCSD 
would shut down the Broncos for the next three and a 
half minutes, with an Allard jumper serving as the final 
bucket of the first half and giving UCSD a five-point lead 
at the break.

“We talk all the time about representing UC San 
Diego in a first-class manner and that’s more than just 
winning,” head coach Chris Carlson said. “It’s how you 
do it, how you play, and how you go about your busi-
ness. I think this group embodies that. They prepare to 
be successful. It’s just like taking a really, really tough 
o-chem test. I think that’s something everyone at UCSD 
can relate to, and that’s our approach.”

After scoring seven points and grabbing six rebounds 
for UCSD in the first half, Lawlor set the pace after 
intermission with a layup, steal, rebound and assist in 
the first 2:50 of the second half. The Tritons captured 
their largest lead of the game, 45-31, following a jumper 
by junior forward Henry Patterson at the 14:06 mark. 
UCSD stayed ahead by double digits until back-to-back 
jumpers and a dunk from Cal Poly Pomona’s leading 
scorer Larry Gordon brought the Broncos to within six 
points, with under 10 minutes to play. Then a Broncos 
three-pointer brought the team within one possession 
with 7:11 remaining in the game, but Lawley responded 
with a layup off an assist by junior forward Shane 
Poppen. Unfortunately, Lawley was called for a technical 
and fouled out during the next Bronco possession, leav-
ing UCSD without its second-leading scorer for the final 
six and a half minutes of the game.

After Tsagarakis converted both technical free throws 
to again bring Cal Poly Pomona within three, Gordon 
had a chance to make it a one-point game from the line. 
Gordon missed both opportunities, and, following a 
UCSD miss on the front end of a one-and-one on the

Junior guard Kelvin Kim was just 1-of-6 from the field and scored only five points, but was tied for the team 
lead with five assists to help the Tritons advance to the NCAA Divison II West Regional for the first time.

Heading into CCAA tournament, the 
program had yet to win a Division II 
playoff game, but now will advance to 
the National Tournament with a No. 8 
seed in the upcoming West Regional.
