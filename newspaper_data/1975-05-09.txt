Gallery Looks For Space 
by Wanda Brown 

Staff Reporter 

The efforts of the Un-
dergraduate Art Gallery to 
prov ide an opportunity for all 
undergraduate students to show 
thei r creative work may come to a 
ha lt if a new location isn't found 
by next fall. 

The approximate 2QOO sQ. ft. of 
space in the Undergraduate 
Ga ll ry is in the Humanities and 
Social Science Building (HSS 
1145) It was expected by tho e 
who organized the gallery that 
the pace would be temporary . 
The room has been allocated to 
the 0 iology Department for 
off ice spa e. Y t the knowledge 
that th spac wa already 
programmed for the Sociology 
o partment did not slow the 
mome ntum and profess ional 
planning by the Undergraduate 

tudent's Union, a group of 
stude nts who organized the 
gallery The main concern from 
the on et has b en to establish a 
perma nent outl t in which all 
undergraduates ca n exhibit their 
work and express their creativity 
b It through drama, dance, 
photography, film or sculpture. 

Backed Its Efforts 

The Visual Arts D partment has 
upported th ga llery and has 

Fifth Ann iversa ry 

stres ed the importance of it 
continuation. 

Moira Roth , director of the 
Mandeville Art Gallery, finds the 
Undergraduate Art Gallery " very 
exc iting." She has continually 
backed its efforts but emphasizes 
that "the students initiated it 
themselve ." 

Newton Harrison, Chairman of 
the Visual Arts Department, 
sensitive to th hard work and 
planning, feel its organizers 
should receive 199 credit. If no 
pace is made available for the 

ga llery next fall, he feels the 
spa ce could be "e ff ctive ly 
hared " with the graduate 
tudent' Humaniti es Library 

Gallery. 

Upon seeing the last exhibit, of 
which over 100 people attended 
the opening, Provost John Stewart 
feels it would be " heartbreaking" 
to see all the professionalism' 
which characterized the show 
com to an end. Steward supports 
the ga llery and ha been working 
to find pace in the fall

CalPIRG S~eks Support 
for New Student Fee 

by Sonja Nash 
Staff Wri ter 

CalPIRG is once again seeking 
ignatures to obtain a mandatory 

fee . The fee would be $1 .50 per 
quarter to be collected along with 
registration fees . 

I n April 1972, 57 percent of the 
tudent body igned a si milar 

petition ca lling for the mandatory 
fee The petition of 1972 had the 
largest response of any campus 
petition ever, Cal PIRC 
spokesmen ay Even though this 
was a majority of the student 
body, th regents fai led to act on 
the petition 

Other UC Campuses 
Once again a petition is being 

circula ted to have the fees made 
mandatory . Drives have been 
made on UC Santa Barbara, UC 
Berkeley, and other UC cam-
puses . 

I n addition to paying 
for professionals, fees would pay

Wed nesday night at 8 00 ten 
tudents met on Rev lie Plaza to 

hold a two hour ca ndle light Vigil 
In memory of the ' Kent State 
Incident, George Winnie, and all 
who died for the war in Viet Nam . 
u an Han on ca lled for the v igil 

on the anniversary of the Kent 
tate killings to honor and 

re m mber the tragedy and 
bravery of those who resisted the 
wa r during the peace movement. 

Ultimate Pro test • 
In 1970, a few days after Kent 

tat , George Winnie walked on 
to Reve lle Plaza, doused his body 
Wi th gasoline and performed the 
ult imate protest by burning 
himself in front of horrified UCSD 
student . He lived through the 
trag ic event and students held a 
massive vigil for him shortly 
aft rwards At that time hundreds 

of concerned persons crowded 
the plaza and filled it with oft 
ca ndle light. In 1975 there were 
only ten, grouped around a few 
dozen ca ndl s to rempmber 
George Winnie's act. 

Lack of Awareness 
The small turnout Wednesday 

wa largely due to lack of 
, publici ty for the vigil , but it can 
also be blamed on tudents' lack 
of awareness or concern for the 
peace struggle of the late 60' and 
early 70's . I t seems today's UCSD 
students were too young then to 
remember the seriousness of the 
movement to end Viet Nam . They 
had no friends or brothers who 
were killed or maimed in In-
dochina ; they didn' t see fellow 
students arrested, beaten, and 
killed for disagreeing with 
government policies ; th~y don't 
remember the millions who

Tan na's Column Shows Naivete 
Tom Tanana recent analysis 

of the war'in So.th Vietnam show 
a naivete about the ramifications 
of using mililary power against 
foreign goverflments and also a 
basic misunderstanding of the 
very American principles which 
he is so anxious for us to get into 
wars over. 

I n his article he uses the 
analogy of a boxer needing to be 
offensive in order to win a fight to 
show that the U.S. should be 
more aggressive in its foreign 
poli·cy . However, a boxing match 
is staged to entertain people; no 
group derives suc h a benefit from 
a war. except the military-
industrial complex. Each of the 
boxers is worse off for having 
fought, and on a world scale, 
there is no analogy for the winner 
of a fight, unless it's the side 
which has overkilled the other 
side the most after the 
radioactive dust has settled . An 
argument can be made for having 
a strong national defense to deter 
other countries from aggressing, 
but for the U.S. itself to commit 
aggression in order to " win" is 
certainly not the way to avoid a 
confrontation which could cause 
world destruction . 

The article also states "We 
hould have moved in , taken 

over, and completely overhauled 
the South Vietnamese govern-
ment, leaving them with a 
republic that respects the rights 
of the individual," in other words-
shove freedom down their 
throats . By what power does the 
U.S. have the right to move in and 
overhaul any foreign govern-
menU I 'm sure conservatives 
abhorred the Russian imposition 
of a,government in Hungary and 
Czechoslovakia and, yet, Mr. 
Tanana 's article advocates that 
exact technique; a technique 
which IS arrogant and 1m· 
perialistic no matter how good 
the Imposed government is 
c laimed to be. 

Another amazing line from the 
article was " The generals should 
have been allowed to fight the 
war (and the politicians shouldn't 
have gotten into the action to 
screw everything up)" Perhaps 
democracy isn 't one of the 
characteri stics Mr. Tanana likes 
in our gClvernment. In most 
tyrannies and dictatorships, the 
generals do con trol the fighting of 
wars (and usually all other 
governmental functions) . But 
the U.s . is supposed to have a 
democratic system where elected 
representatives decide what 
policies , including military 
policies , to pursue, not 
unelected, professional military 
men who tend to think that the 
use of force is the solution to all 
foreign problems. Even the U.S. 
Constitution . to use an unim-

peachable source, emphasizes 
the role of both the Congress and 
the President in the area of war. 
And so it seems strange to hear 
from a supposed American 
patriot that we should disregard 
the people's elected represen-
tatives and trust the generals in a 
war . , 

Conservatives often eem 
oblivious to the fact that military 
aggression against Russia or Red 
China risks provoking a full-scale 
war which would leave millions 
of people dead on each side. The 
Russians or Chinese would run 
the same risk if they invaded the 
US . It shows a naivete and a 
gross insensitivity for human life 
to suggest we should have in-
vaded Red China, without even 
mentioning the possible reper-
cussions, as Mr. Tanana's article 
does. 

I think we should realize that 
there will always be different 
social and political systems, but 
that unless we want to militarily 
impose governments allover the 
world, (making nuclear war 
extremely likely) we and the 
Communists have no choice but 
to continue to coexist. Fur-
thermore, until we have improved 
our economic situation, con-
trolled pollution and ended 
poverty for the 30-40 million 
Americans who live in it, we 
shouldn 't just assume that our 
system is best. And even if it is a 
good system for us , other 
countries with different cultures 
and levels of development may 

be more suited to other political 
and economic systems . 

I agree with Mr. Tanana that we 
were bound to lose in Vietnam . 
We were supporting a regime 
without widespread support 
among its people, headed by a 
man that even Mr. Tanana's 
article adm itted was a "petty 
fascist dictator" agai nst the 
Communist forces which many 
Vietnamese identified with the 
fight for Independence; Ho Chi 
Minh and his followers had 
fought against the Japanese in 
WWII , then against the French 
colonld lists (who the U .S. 
naturally supported) and finally 
against the Americans. Of course 
we could have taken more drastic 
action than the half million men, 
30 billion dollars a vear effort that 
we put in , such as an invasion of 
Red China, as Mr. Tanana 
suggests. But even if that could 
have won the war without 
provoking a nuclear war (which in 
my opinion i doubtful) what 
would we have won? In Korea . 
where we did better, the 
government is still a dictatorship 
and all newspapers are censored 
to keep all criticism of the 
government out of them . 

I hope that detente and 
disarmament can go forward in 
order to reduce the risk of world 
destruction . And if we do decide 
on some military action, I hope it 
will be in support of a govern-
ment which actuillly has some 
good characteristics, not one 
which is bad but happens to be 
anti-Communist.

White Woman Felt Threatened 
At Cinco de Mayo Fete 

I am a white woman commenting on the performance about white 
propaganda and oppression at the Cinco de Mayo celebration . The 
actors were Black and spoke to what appeared to be an audience 
composed mostly of minorities. The performance was concluded with 
shouts of " But Whites, We Steel Love You". at which time all the> actors 
exposed long, si lver knives . Applause was heard . 

My purpo e in thiS letter IS not to offend others or to defend myself 
or my race It IS merely to express that I felt threatened and helpless . I 
realize that not being a Third World person , I will never fully un -
derstand that position . But I also realize that hate only breeds hate. I 
felt as if I had been labeled as an enemy, although I did not wish to be 
on.e. I felt much hate and anger being expressed, which I feel can be 
more positive when they are directed towards ideas, not people. I 
sensed a desire for revenge . 

I saw a young white child (about 5 years old) run past me. My 
thought was that this little boy, who probably feels no animosity 
towards minority per ons now, must be taught to protect himself He 
must be taught that there are black persons who want to harm him 
because he is white. In that instant, I saw the Black as an oppressor. I 
see hate breeding hate breeding hate.

Graduation Committee Makes 
Recommendation on Gift 
A suggestion that the Revelle Graduating Class of 1975 make the 
class gi/i a contribution to a UCSD project to help eliminate 
jeoparCly to brain development due to undernutrition m San DTego 
County . . . 

For more than two years, a small group of· undergraduates and 
faculty at UCSD has provided research insight into the practi cal 
problem of nutrition relating to brain development. This group 
established for the first time nutritional criteria below which brain 
development is in unambiguous jeopardy. ' By applying these criteria 
to available nutrition su rvey data and projecting the data to th San 
Diego community, it was found that in this county there were, as of 
April 1970, more than 6200 pregnant and lactating women. infants and 
children under four years of age who were in such leopardy. Th 
primary problem relates to low income diets compounded by a rather 
universal unawareness of th e requirements for good nutrition during 
the period of rapid brain growth. If the unborn or young child IS un-
dernourished during this period the brain is smaller and has fewer cells 
and communica tions. No later feeding can compensate for this loss 
Therefore, this is a precious period for human development 

With the more than 30 per cent increase in the cost of living, the 
more that 50 per cent increase in the cost of food and the three-fold 
Increase in unemployment in San Diego since 1970, the number of 
women , infants and children under four in jeopardy has undoubtedly 
risen. The UCSD group estimates there may be more than 8,000 In-
dividual pre ntly in such leopardy. 

Thus, undernutrition of epidemic proportions has been identified 
right here in San Diego. What can be done about this problem? This 
same research group, which ca lls itself the Committee for Un-
dernourished People (CUP). has been working to raise sufficient funds 
to provision a pilot project for nutritional supplementatio n of the diets 
of pregnant or lactating women, infants and children under four and 
for follOWing the progress of the children's development over a period 
of several years . It is expected that the re ults of this project will reveal 
that by nutr i tional supplementation during the critical period for brain 
development (from conception through age four), brain development 
will approximate its genetic potential and thus will provide the e 
chi ldren a fairer opportunity for quality of life and achievem nt. It 
follow that they will be less likely to depend on their family and on 
society and more likely to contribut positively to th ir community 
Hopefully, by these means, th pre ent recy<;ling of poverty can be 
interrupted. 

These worthy endeavors require significant starting costs of 
associated research . At present there is a need for developing expliCit 
plans to provide for expert consultation and to sover the costs of Init ial 

"These criteria can be applied to Recommended Daily Allowances 
IRDA J for all age, sex, and occupation IJroups. They include people 
ingesting less than 70 percent of the calorie RDA and/or less than 40 
percent 01 the protein RDA. It is found that such individuals are also 
ingesting less 01 other essenti,,1 nutrients to a critical degree ilnd that 
children in the poverty population hilVe small head circumferences 
although matched children fed above these criteria approach normal 
head size.

The U(SD Gay tudents ASSOCia tion (GSA) IS an organizaflon 
dedicated to Improving (he quality of Gay Students' lives . Of equal 
Importance is the establishment of posi tive relations between the Gays 

.and Straights of our community and the discrediting of the homosexual 
stereotypes . In essence, we want to refl ect a pOSitive and more truthful 
image of the Gay Community. 

Oudirst meeting was held early in the Winter quart r of 1975; since 
.then the ~SA has continued to meet every Monday at a time and 
location regularly specified in the Triton Times. The meting prOVide 
us with a comfortable social enviroment where we may meet and work 
together constructively. After organizational business , the meeting 
usually break down into smaller groups to discuss a variety of topic of 
special interest to Gay Students including . California's sex laws, 
problems of harassment and discrimination , comi ng out , relationships 
with friends and family , and oth~r social and political concerns 

One of our first pro jec ts was to establish a Gav Phone Line in our 
office at the Student Center. It IS used by Gays, Bi's, and Straights as an 
informational service. Although the malority of calls deal With specific 
questions, many are from Gays who ju t want to talk with someone 
The phone line has become a source of inform al counseling and 
personal assistance to all Gays, Including those who feel the need for 
communication with other Gay People, but are hesitant to partiCipate 
In our activities It is staffed by our members and may be reached 
weekdays and evenings at 4~2:3931 . 

I n April we held our Organizational Coming Out Party. and are 
currently co-sponsoring a Non-Sexist Dance with the Women's Center 
In addition . UCS[J was represented in a workshop at UCLA for the West 
Coast Gay Students' Organizations 

Before the establl hment of the GSA, no Gay Students ' Organization 
existed at any San Diego co llege or university Because of thiS VOid, 
some students expenenced frustration and loneliness while others were 
forced to seek social lives based predominantly off campus. Through 
the As ociation. we have prOVided a source of com munica tion , In-
lormation and moral support . We sincerely hope all Gay and 131 
Students wi ll use the GSA's facilities to their full capacity 

Arguments Against Gun 
Control Are Unconvincing 

by Sara Lowen 
Editorial Director 

The clamor for strict gun control legislation is stronger now than It 
has been since 1968. Strict gun control is long overdue In the United 
States Although a majority of the American people have supported 
some measure of handgun control since 1940, efforts to legislate strong-
gun-control have been weakened repeatedly by the powerful American 
Rifle Association lobby. The weak gun control legislation passed In 
1968 merely requires that gun dealers and purchasers fill out forms 
listing the age, sex and address of the purchaser. This act hasn 't made It 
appreciably more difficult for anyone to purchase a handgun 

The Increa e In the number of serious crime In the past few year 
bespeaks the need for strong gun control legislation. Incidents of 
erious crime rose 17 percent in the past year and a large portion of 

the e cri mes involved handguns. Attorney General LeVI estimates that 
more than . half the murders, one third of the aggravated assault and 
one fourth of the robberies committed in 1973 were committed With 
handguns . 

The arguments that gun owners make against gun control are un-
convinCing. Gun owners claim that homeowners need handguns to 
defend their hom S; in actuality, only 2 percent of home robberies 
result In the trespasser's being shot by the homeowner. The argum ent 
that unregulated ownershop of guns I an American tradition IS un-
dermined by the fact that the towns of the old We t, Including Dodge

As I was sitting on the toilet someti~e ago, commenting on the state 
of world affairs, it occured to me to ask myself just what I was doing 
with my life. I knew I wasn't dOing too we" in my chosen field of study. 
Further, I knew that I wasn't a Christian yet I managed to irritate people 
because I preached occasionally . The answer was glaringly apparent: I 
must be in student politics . 

It was sometime after I had been appointed Coordinatorperson of 
the Task Force to Investigate the Committee on Appointments that I 
first felt something was wrong. Not with the committee, that is, but 
with me. The committee was mad~ up of five idealistic students who 
were a" sure they had " the Answer." Maybe they did . But I knew I 
didn' t have the answer at all. At times, even the Question eluded me. 

Here' l was in the Big. University, safe and snug like a bug in the rug, 
fighting the forces of evil and injustice on the battlefields of the 
Student Center over such issues of universal concern as what to do 
with the revenue from vending machines, what band to hire for the 
next dance, etc. And as I spent the last of dad's check for a ninety-five. 
cent breakfast, I came to the realization that I was copping out. 

Instead of being out there in the real world, working beside the 
People, I was sitting in conference rooms, talking endlessly about 
reform, Justice, and freedom without ever doing much to further them . 
Instead of organizing the people, I was organizing students who were 
starved for recognition. Instead of educating the People, I was trying to 
educate the elitists . 

Why was I doing this? Simply because the big corporations had 
planned it to be so. 

Since time immemorial. big money has instilled in just about 
everyone the desire to lead a moderately secure and comfortable life. 
Don' t believe me? just ask around and see how many people deny 
they'd like to live such a life. . 

And the big corporations have done more, too. Thanks to them, we 
now have Institutions of Higher learning. They do not support colleges 
and universities out of philanthropy, oh oo! They have a very big stake 
in universities, for it is here that the future leaders and " trouble 
makers" are diverted and broken. Here we are forced to break our butts 
for four or five years while the rest of the world goes on without us. At 
the same time, they try to divert us by enticing us into " political ac-
tivism" in order to make us divide our energies and render us inef-
fective in both endeavors. 

When I realized thiS, I knew immediately what I had to do, and I did 
it . No, I didn't drop out and live with the worker; I just decided that as 
long as I was here, I might as well learn something_ I figure that after 
my f'lur years are up I'll be able to live and work for what I believe in . 

You , too, can break free from the plans of the big corporations . It's 
simple. What you do is decide what you need to know in order to 
implement your plans for change . Devote yourself to the subject and 
finish as soon as you can . Don't wait to graduate with yot.it buddies, for 
by the time you leave the university it may be too late for your efforts 
to do any good for society. Once you know what you need to know, get 
out into the world and begin to work for what you believe. 

Don 't waste your time here absorbing the smell of the upper five 
percent who never did a lick of work in their lives, people who have 
been duped by big money into being pawns or victims of often par-
ticularly sensitive noses.

Yet, with a much larger public 
seeing the work, Steward realizes 
that it would "be hard to provide 
proper security." Th.e initiation of 
a campaign to raise money for the 
construction of a new gallery is 
another conceivable prospect for 
next fa ll. " An inexpensive shell or 
building with at least 2000 SQ. ft. 
of disp lay space would be ideal," 
says Stewart. However, it would 
have to be constru cted with non-
state money, as all money 
received from the state must be 
tied with instruction or course 
work. 

Doniltion of Funds 

There is a combination of fund-
raising possibilities whi ch involve ' 
the donation of funds controlled 
by the executive committees of 
the various colleges, funds from 
outside sources supportive of the 
Arts, or funds raised from benefit 
films or concerts.

I left the San Diego Fatty Acid 
Group concert unconvinced that 
it hold ever really happened at all . 
However, as I am unable to 
account In any other way 'for my 
wh reabouts between 8:30 and 
10.30 on MOllday evening (hours 
when I might otherwise have 
been doing something useful). I 
am forced, however reluctantly, 
to conclude that something of th 
sort must indeed have occurred . 

Highlight for the show tonight week 's free concert, M. rtin and 
is a performance of McLeod's Lever, a UCS D based duo 
long time keynote piece "Satan's ~pecializing in delicate har -
Creation" to be performed with monies and strong performances.

San Diego Symphony 
"Lacked Commitment" 

by lim Shipman 
Art s Wri ter 

There are some symphonic works which must be performed timidly, 
tenderly--wlth ubdued passion-in order for the work to weave Its 
magic into one's seldom-stimulated finer sensibiliti es. Then there are 
those pieces which would suffer terribly at uch treatml'nt Of . the 
latter, perhaps the best example is Beethoven's "Symphony No. 5. In C 
Minor, Op. 67 " This particular work literally demands a forceful 
commitm nt from the orchestra a"d conductor , 

Unfortunately, this commitment was lacking in Friday's performance 
by the San Diego Symphony. The orchestra appeared to be qUite 
willing to muster the effort for a memorable rendi,ion, but.guestcon-
ductor Walter Herbert of the San Diego Opera, continually "shushed" 
them into a restrained and far too timid tempo. A a result, the Fifth 
was sluggish, uneven, a trifle irritating. and ultimately disappointing. 

Continued on Page 7 

Perhaps I am being unduly harsh . 
After all, evenings of dreadfully 
performed musica l esoterica are 
rare enough without questioning 
the exi tence of tnis one . 

I or lAstance, no doubt few 
reader are familiar with the work 
of Hy Cage, a prophetic musical 
humori t whose cartoon ap-
peared regularly in the noted (if 

~omewhat obscure) journal Hude 
from 1931 to 1933. The now 
defunct Etude, a magazine tn-
tended primarily for piano 
teachers, was, for many years, a 
ba tion of musical conservatism 
Hy Cage's cartoons depict, among 
other things, 'modernist' om-
posers utiliZing outla ndi sh 
(nowaday we might say 'com-
monplace ' ) (ompos i tlonal 
techniques. influence , and 
~ources of insplra\ion . These 
cartoons would hardly be on-
>ldered remarkable, especia lly 
conSidering I:tude 's ed Itorlal 
menta lity, except that a com-
poser named John Cage (who was 
in hi s early twenties when the e 
cartoons appeared, dnd WilS 
probably starving to death 
somewhere) would later be 
regarded as th first to use 
precisely these compositional 
devices (silence. environmental 
sou nds, zen influences, etc. ). 

On the basis of this and other 
evidence, the three member of 
ratty Acid have been able to 
re'con~truct the details of a 
bizarre plot of extraordinary 
dimensions I nvolved are the likes 
of Cage, DaVid Tudor (who is the 
ongl nal interpreter of much of 

lo~n Cag("s music, and who, it 
develops , wa once a piano 

~tudent of the editor-in-chlef of 
!.tude magazine), and a sinister 
c haril c ter named Eisenhower 

U~a hev ky Suffice It to ay that 
many We'll known modern 
compo\er~ are now m rely 

brainwa~hed lombies of their 
tOrlner selves why 1'1 e, we may 
'l')k, would they Insist o n torCIAg 
their wretched musIc on uch a 
ho~tlle public' 

In ,>upport of their thesis, fatty 
Acid performed a number ot 
pre~umed early pieces (first 
publl~hed, of cour e, in Ltude) by 
~uch modern giants a Ashley, 
Hdler . and Strang However , ratty 
Acid 's dedication to the lofty 
~tandard of inept performance 
(we thrive on Incompetence," 
exclaimed organist Warren l:Iurt 
as he tried desperately to 
.. traighten out one of the multi -
co lored background sets that the 
group used) made it difficult at

combl ned ,111 01 hi~ talents ior keeping an audl nce roiling in the aisles, 
and did It for over two hours befon' a near-capacity crowd of 2,800 

The small theater was a Pf'rfect setting for the man who has been 
known for television, records, and now for doing whatever he wants to 
do Dr ssed ca ually, In grey flaired pants, multi-colored shirt, and 
I,:reen ve~t , Cosby just sat and talked, yet kept everyone int res ted 

Cosby add trange sounds (dentiSt's utensil in hiS mouth, after 
having novacaine shots) through uperb use of the microphone, 
1I111tations (trom a 72 year old lady teacher to kmdeq;arten kids), and 
the de~criptive stares and body motion that only he can come up 
with .

Coming betw!'l'n the two hfths was Arnold Schonberg's " Verklarte

Irom the work of Richard Dehmel In it, a woman confesses to her lover 
that 'ihe i, pregnant , but not by him, he comforts her and declare that 
the baby Will be thpirs, a product of their transfigured love. The full

rhl' only thing that se med to upset him was that he had 10 tdke a

The ~ubject of driving got the best respon e. Cosby start d off by 
~aylng that It' drivers that actually have the biggest egos In the world , 
espeCia lly when they 're b hind the wh el " There's never been a driver 
In the world who thought he had done soml'thing wrong In case of 
aCCident. he lust ay "if the other guy hadn;t b en th re , nothing 
would have happened " 11 another guy does something wrong, a dflver 
will speed up to get n xt to the guy, lust to see what a real IdiOt looks 
like " 

Cosby ran th gamut, talking about very thing from interviewers 
("Why do they always have to Intervi w lh poor guy whos Wife ha 
IU'>t been killed a their hou e f II down the hili dUring a mudslld ' ''), 
to heal th tl'achNs ("MinI' told me that I couldn't eat candy becaus 
,ugar would ('at my face out and I'd look all ugly lust because of a Baby 
Ruth ") 

One of Cosby 's best lines In a near-perfect performance was one he 
,aid he borrowed from DaVid ~renner " Why do they always blame the 
hou ewtfe lor 'rlng-a round-the-collar'," he asked, "Why not just tell the 
hu band to wash hiS neck' "
