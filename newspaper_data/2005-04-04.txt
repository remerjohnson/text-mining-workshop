Senators approve closed llleetings 
State meeting laws don't apply, Aguilar says 

By PATRICK ALLEN 
Senior Staff Writer 

Senators on the A.S. Council 
will be able to close their meet-
ings to the public under changes 
approved by the council on March 
30. 

According to the bylaw chang-
es, meetings of the .S. senate 
coulct be closed to the public for 
any reason by a two-thirds vote 
of the enators. The amendment 
wa written by John Muir ollege 

enior enator eil pear, who 
said that it was necessary to have 
a formalized procedure in case 
the senate needed to limit the 
meetings exclu ively to council-
members. 

"During the [Student-Run 
Television] controversy, the senate 
needed' to discuss the document 
prepared by Campus Counsel Ann 
Parode, which was protected by 
attorney-client privilege," Spears 
said. "We had to close the meet-
ing in order to discuss the very 
important legal ramifications in 
the document." 

Billy Wong/Guardian 
Closed doors: Under changes in the A.s. senate bylaws, senators can now 
choose to close their meetings to the public by a two-thirds vote. 

Despite the circumstances 
that prompted the legislation, 
the changes do not place any 
limitations on the reasons for 
which a meeting can be closed. 
Such a broad provision cou ld 

run against the spirit, if not the 
letter, of the state's variou open-
meeting statutes, according to 
California First Amendment 
Coalition Executive Director 
Peter Scheer. The nonprofit 
group monitors compliance with 
open-government laws. 

"What all of these laws have in 
common is that you can't close a 
meeting whenever you want to," 
Scheer said. "It has to be for one 
of a number of specified reasons. 
You can't just take away the rights 

of the public to view the proceed-
ings." 

Scheer, however, said he was 
unfamiliar with the specific law 
that applied to student govern-
ments in the UC system. 

The council's adherence to 
open-meeting laws was also ques-
tioned in February 2004 when 
the UCSD College Republicans 
accused the council of failing to 
post agendas 72 hours in advance

Students to vote on two referenda 
Structure proposal facing stronger opposition 

By CHARW NGUYEN 
Staff Writer 

In two referenda on th is 
week's ballot, students will have 
the opportunity to decide on the 
structure of A.S. representation 
and the future of student-initiated 
outreach programs. 

If approved by a major-
ity of students, the Developing 
Opportunities through Outreach 
and Retention Services referen-
dum would increase the quarterly 
ASUCSD Student Activity Fee by 
$3 per student in order to fund 
student-initiated outreach. 

A.S. President Jenn Pae said 
she considers D.O.O.R.S. as sup-
port long overdue for outreach 

efforts. 
"We're in the situation where 

the state has basically not pri-
oritized higher education as they 
should have," she said. "We're not 
only hit with the state administra-
tion, but even with our own cam-
pus. We're receiving less support, 
more specifically to SIO. T hey 
don't see it as a priori ty." 

The university's budget allo-
cated for student outreach shrank 
&om $120,000 two years ago to 
$20,000 this year, Pae said, a trend 
that could soon lead to the elimi-
nation of the whole set of pro-
grams .

to interest them in higher educa-

an all-day high school conference 
where 500 high school students 
attend workshops and peer-advis-
ing sessions, according to A.S. 
Vice President Externa l Rigo 
Marquez. 

"Students become stronger 
leaders and mentors because they 
create their own programs, but 
also these outreach projects serve 
as a form of retention as well," 
he said. "Many students said th.at

ISecond Sun God' likely 

smaller than original 
Current commissioner says 
sponsorship goal unrealistic 

By VLADIMIR KOGAN 
News Editor 

If its candidates are elected into 
office and can successfully persuade 
senators to approve its draft budget, 
the SunGod Party's much-advertised 
"Son of Sun God" would look soik-
inglysimilarto a "Friend ofFallFest." 
In the best-case budget scenario, the 
new festival funded under the slates 
proposed spending plan would be 
much closer in size and scale to the 
annual full celebration than the infa-
mous springtime bash. 

Promising a total of almost 
$115 ,000 for the new event, the 
Sun God Party's budget would pro-
vide roughly half of the nearly 
$200,000 price tag for last year's 
Sun God festival. The party has 
pledged to spread the money 
across two days of programming, 
leaving $85,000 to fund the Friday-
night concert. That amount would 
barely cover base costs like light-
ing, security and staging, which 
totaled more than $88,000 for last 
yea r 's festival, without leaving any 
funds to hire actual performers to 
play at the event, according to last 
year's budget. 

"Even if they get all of their 
sponsorship, I feel like their second 
Sun God will basically be a Fall 
Fest on the field ," said current A.S. 
Commis ioner of Programming 
Rishi Shah, who has endorsed 
Revolution! slate's Eric Morris 
as his replacement. ''They're just 
renaming it, that' all they're doing. 
I kind of see it as just a ploy to trick 

people for voting for them." 
The question of the name aside, 

SunGod Party's presidential can-
didate Daniel Watts said the event 
would likely be smaller in scale 
than the annual Sun God festi-
val, and could even be held inside 
RIMAC Arena to keep costs down. 
It would be a "Son of Sun God" 
because the event would attempt 
to mimic the larger festival's atmo-
sphere and take advantage of simi-
lar warm weather, he said.

Vote: Spears may introduce 
specific limits for new bylaw 

cominued from page I 
of its meetings, as required by 
the state's Ralph M . Brown Act. 
According to Director of Student 
Policies and Judicial Affairs 
Nicholas S. Aguilar, the A.S. 
Council is only constrained by its 
own constitution and bylaws and 
is not bound by the Brown Act or 
other laws. However, he said he 
believes the council should follow 
the spirit of the state laws. 

\Vhil e student governments 
in communi ty colleges and the 
California State University sys-
tcm arc required by law to con-
duct their meeti ngs in publ ic, 
those ta tutes include no analo-
gous regulations for UC campus-
e. Before the enactme nt of the 

,loria Romero O pen Meetings 
Act of 2000, the laws also exclud -
ed campuses in the CSU system. 
T his piece of legislation, however, 
requi red the student governments 
at all CSU campuses to conduct 
open meetings, unle s the situ-
ation deals with advice from an 
attorney. 

Unlike the CSU system, the 
UC Board of Regents is vested 
with the university's governing 

authority directly by the state 
constitution, meaning that state 
laws can only urge the regents to 
take specific actions but cannot 
require them to do so. 

Spears said that his legisla-
tion was not meant to shut the 
meetings to the public indiscrimi-
nately, but to provide a legitimate 
mechanism for closing the meet-
ing if it was necessary. 

"There are not very many 
instances where it would be neces-
sary to close the meeting," Spears 
said. "In fact, it may never need to 
be closed again . But 1 realized that 
if anyone brought up an objecti on 
to closing the meeting, we woul d 
not be abl e to talk about the very 
important document." 

He also said he agreed that 
the spiri t of the Romero Act 
should be followed by the UC 
student councils and that he 
would be amenable to amending 
the bylaws again to add an exclu-
sive list of reasons for which 
A.S . senate meetings could be 
closed.

Roosevelt slate 

disqualified in race 
The Eleanor Roosevelt College 

Elections Committee voted 4-0-1 to 
disqualify all five candidates running 
on the Rooseve~ Dynamite slate. The 
slate violated the college's bylaws by 
failing to secure prior approval for 
all of its campaign material prior to 
use, as is required for all candidates 
who accept voluntary spending limits, 
according to Roosevelt Elections 
Manager James Liu. 

The slate includes one AS. Council 
candidate - candidate for Rooseve~ 
senior senator Julie Sepulveda - and 
four other college-specific contenders. 

The college's judicial board will 
meet in a closed meeting at 9 p.m. on 
April 4 to hear an appeal in the case. 

Supreme Court protects 
Title IX whistle&lowers 

In a dose 5-4 vote. a majority of 
Supreme Court justices voted in favor of 
whistleblower protections for coaches 
and teachers who report Title IX vio-

requires universities to provide women 
with equal access to resources. 

In the majority opinion, Justice 
Sandra Day O'Conner stated that report-
ing discrimination would be discDur-
aged and that those reporting the viola-
tions could face unpunished retaliation 
without the decision. The case began 
when a girt's basketball coach claimed 
he was fired for complaining over unfair 
treatment of his team. 

Joumalist, UCSD grad 
speaks at forum 

Pulitzer prize-wlnnlng New York 
Times investigative reporter Lowell 
Bergman discussed politics, big busi-
ness and contemporary joumalism 
in a Revelle Forum talk with UCSD 
history professor Michael Bemstein 
on March 30. 

Bergman worked for more than 
20 years at news divisions of broad-
casters ABC and CBS, and was a staff 
producer for '60 Minutes' for 14 
years. He was also one of the original 
producers of "20/20." 

He has produced work conceming 
topics such as labor rela~ons and terror-
ism, and his work attacking practices of 
the tobacco industry was dramatized in 
the 1999 film 'The Insider." 

After graduating from the University 
of Wisconsin, Bergman came to UCSD 
to pursue a graduate degree in phi-
losophy with the late professor Herbert 
Marcuse. At the talk, Bergman discussed 
his first e:q>eriences in San Diego and

Bergman also presented his views 

on the relationship between politics 
and joumalism. Citing the 'corporati-
zation" of joumalism In modem soci· 
ety, he encouraged joumalists to look 
less at mainstream stories to generate 
interesting works that might have a 
great social impact. 

Bergman is a producer and cor-
respondent for the PBS documen-
tary series "Frontline" and an adjunct 
professor at the Graduate School of 
Joumalism at UC Berkeley. He is 
also working on a documentary on 
European terrorism.

will discuss political change and conflid 
in Ihe Middle East at a free event The 
talk will take place April 6 in the Institute 
of the Americas' Weaver Center. 

The panel will feature Los Angeles 
Times staff writer Tony Perry, who was 
'embedded' with U.s. troops in Iraq 
for two separate tours, UCSD associ-

Scientists working at UCSD School

prevent the formation of tumors. 

Described in the joumal Molecular 
Cell, the compound has been shown 
to delete a molecule used by proteins 
to signal cell growth. In normal cells, 
they maintain the balance between cell 
growth and cell death.

Slate: Altick secured no sponsors in office UC faculty protest PSAT 
merit scholarships contin~d from page I lar warm weather, he said. 

"It's a 'Son of Sun God' because 
it will be earlier in the fall, so it 
will still be warm," Watts said. 
"No matter what we call it, it will 
be great." 

However, Morris said that the 
SunGod Patty's platfonn is disin-
genuous, promising voters more 
than the candidates can actually 
deliver. 

"If people really want a sec-
ond FailFest, I'd be up for that," 
Morris said. "The problem is that 
they're telling the voters that it 
would be a second Sun God festi-
val, and that's not true." 

Tammie Nguyen, Morris ' 
challenger on the SunGod Party, 
said the quarrel over nomen-
clature largely misses the entire 
point of her slate's platform: 
By cutting waste, the slate can 
increase programming for stu-
dents. By renegotiating current 
contracts, Nguyen said she was 
sure she could reduce costs to 
afford a memorable fall extrava-
ganza. 

"I think it's more of a second 
Sun God," she said. "If we get all of 
the money that we've expected to 
put on the second Sun God, then it 
will be a second Sun God." 

But getting all of the money 
would mean raising 550,000 in 
sponsorships for the program-
ming office next year, or about 
10 times the amount its current 
sponsorship coordinator collected 
this year. And this year was the 
best the office on record, accord-
ing to Morris, the office's current 
festivals coordinator. 

"1 think that's pretty much 
impossible," Shah said about rais-
ing that amount of money. "Unless 
it's someone's dad, it's not going 
to happen. If you had somebody 

_ working on it for two or three 

years, then maybe - and then it's. 
a big maybe." 

Watts, however, said the 
SunGod Party is confident that 
the amount can be raised, refer-
ring to the expertise of the slate's 
candidate for John Muir College 
senior sell2tor, John A1tick, who 
worked as one of the sponsorship 
coordill2tors in the programming 
office last year. 

A1tick himself, however, admits 
that he actually wasn't able to 
finalize any sponsorships during 
the entire year he spent in the 
office. 

"I didn't finish any deals," 
Altick said. "I didn't actually get 
any sponsorship." 

But part of the reason pro-
grammers have struclc out with 
big companies may be the rather 
lackluster package they offer to 
potential sponsors, with few good-
ies to attract big dollars because of 
the office's fears of becoming too 
"corporate," he said. 

However, Shah said his office 
has been aggressive in pursuing 
corporate donors. 

"With sponsorship this year and 
last year, we said, 'You mow what, 
I don't think students care about 
[being) too corporate, In Shah said. 
''We don't care. As long as we get 
a bigger show and more students 
come out, more corporate doesn't 
make a difference to us." 

T he problem, Morris said, 
is that corporations have been 

hesitant about committing large 
amounts of money without long 
courtship periods. Last year, A1tick 
opened a dialogue with Microsoft, 
and this year, representatives from 
the company have agreed to attend 
the Sun God festival- a trip to be 
partly paid for by student activity 
fees - but still have not commit-
ted to actually giving any money 
in the near future. 

And to plan an event, the pro-
gramming office would need to 
have the money in the bank as 
early as May, so it could \mow 
how much it had to spend and 
begin sending out offers to bands, 
Morris said. 

Realistically, holding the sec-
ond festival in the fall might not 
happen, Nguyen said. 

"We're pushing it for fall," she 
said. "In the case that it doesn't 
work out and we need more time 
to organize, we'd push it back to 
winter quarter." 

Though his opponents can criti-
cize his slate's plan, Watts said, at 
least he has offered concrete details 
to the voters, which none of the 
other challengers have done. 

Whether a "Son of Sun God" 
or "Friend of Fall Fest ," whether 
inside or outside and whether fall 
or winter, his slate knows that 
more fun is what the students 
want, Watts said.

(U. California-Berkeley) 
(U-WIRE) BERKELEY, Calif. 

- The College Board Trustees 
unanimously voted to extend the 
organization 's five-year contract 
with the National Merit Scholarship 
Program in March, dismissing 
the concerns of a University of 
California faculty committee that 
is calling the program's use of the 
PSAT in awarding merit scholar-
ships discriminatory against low-
income and minority students. 

Although the trustees will con-
tinue to discuss the issue, they 
voted to uphold the use of the test 
after hearing a report from a com-
mittee tasked with studying the 
exam, according to a statement. 

"The trustees unanimously 
affinned the role of the PSAT I 
NMSQT as one of the CoUege 
Board's most powerful equity 
and access tools," College Board 
spokeswoman Chiara Coletti stated 
in a written announcement. 

The PSAT is used to whittle 
down the thousands of students 
vying for a merit scholarship. The 
top 16,000 test-takers are qualified 
to receive a scholarship. 

But UC's Board of Admissions 
and Relations with Schools, which 
has studied the test for more than 
five months, said earlier in the month 
.that using the test to determine 
Merit Scholars is not in line with 
the university's mission. The board 
unanimously recommended that 
all eight UC campuses reconsider 
their affiliation with the program 
and any admission preferences given 
to scholarship winners, B.OAR.S. 
Chair Michael Brown said. 

The board began investigat-
ing the scholarship program 
last O ctober, when former UC 
Associate President Patrick Hayashi 
criticized the College Board for 
using a program that determines 
merit based solely on a standard-
ized testing score. 

Hayashi, a former College Board 
trustee, said an uneven proportion 
of winners are largely or exclusively 
white and Asian, a trend he noticed 
while he was an administrator at 
UC Berkeley. 

"We're not objecting that many, 
perhaps aU, national merit scholar-
ship awardees are excellent stu-
dents," Brown said. "What we're 
criticizing is that a single test score 
makes this determination. We 
think that it's unsupported by the 
evidence and highly problematic." 

National Merit Scholarship 
Corporation spokeswoman Elaine 
Detweiler defended the test, saying 
it is a proper screen for the 16,000 
semifinalists across the nation since 
it spotlights a representative group 
of academically talented students. 

"By whatever criteria you use for 
establishing a pool of students, there 
are going to be some who miss the 
pool," she said. "That doesn't mean 
that they are substantially less able 
than those who just made it in." 

She also said that the PSAT is 
only one element used in select-
ing winners. From the 16,000 
semifinalists, the 8,200 winners 
are chosen based on other criteria, 
including grades, writing samples, 
community activities and teacher 
recommendations, she said. 

But Brown said the problem lies 
in the missing da ta o The trustees

Eugene [hri§tollher Sweeten Prp§idpnt 
Sweeten rises above a cluttered playing field with a comprehensive vision 

The presence of several com-
peting ideologies in this year's AS. 
election places on students not 
simply the burden of voting in the 
best candidate for the job, but of 
endorsi ng a specific notion of how 
Associated Students should be run 
and how the all -campus body 
should serve its constituency. 

It will be the exclusive responsi-
bility of the AS. president to trans-
late such a mandate into the $1.4 
million AS. budget, which makes 
this year 's choice for the office even 
more important. With this in mind, 
students should choose Student 
Empowerment"s Christopher 
Sweeten as A.S. president. 

In a race that has largely been 
marked by the campaign promises 
of SunGod Party candidate 
Daniel Watts, Sweeten has 
emerged as the only candidate 
with both a sound vision for the 
executive office and the experi-
ence to validate it. Sweeten hardly 
represents the A.S. status quo, but 
instead stands for informed lead-
ership and a well-devised assess-
ment of the state of affairs at 
UC 0 - exactly that which ren-
der SunGod's claims of A.S. 
malfeasance shortsighted. 

Sweetcn, the cu rrent commis-
sioner o f diversity affairs, will 
fight for students ' rights on multi-
ple fronts. He intends to build 
alliances with students at local 

universi ties, maintain a UCSD 
presence at UC Board of Regents 
meetings and lobby - effectively 
- for issues important to students 
at the state and national levels. 

Sweeten recognizes the impor-
tance of these activities in the day-
to-day lives of students at UCSD, 
citing as evidence student victories 
in lobbying against Proposition 54 
and for increased outreach funding 
from the UC Office of the 
President. 

Although Sweeten has not 
devised a draft budget, he has sev-
eral concrete ideas to shore up 
A.S . funds and increase efficiency. 
He has the best idea of all the can-
didates for streamlining the 
Student Organization Funding 
Advisory Board's quarterly alloca-
tion process, arguing that while 
new groups should not be denied 
funding, longstanding groups 
could be funded for the entire 
year upfront. Also, he logically 
aims to cut A.S. funding for .tu-
dent-initi ated outreach if students 
pass the referendum to increase 
funds for the Student Initiated 
Outreach and Recruitment 
Commission through a $3 bump 
in the quarterly activity fee. 
Finally, Sweeten intends, like sev-
eral other candida tes, to cut out 
the ineffective all -campus pro-
gramming budget line-item and 
return the money to the general 

unallocated pot for all student 
organizations to use. 

Such a varied and calculated 
plan for Associated Students is a 
welcome indicator of Sweeten's 
qualifications. He truly demon-
stra tes an understanding of the 
council 's strengths and weakness-
es, and acknowledges that the 
body is neither perfect nor a com-
plete failure. Such distinction is 
lacking among other candidates 
for the position . 

Watts, who holds little explicit 
experience in student government 
but has a long history as a critic of 
the system, offers a grab bag of 
ideas to fix what he sees as a stag-
nating council. Unfortunately, his 
budget priorities - namely, elimi-
nating AS. stipends and drastically 
cutting the A.S. travel fund to bol-
ster funding for programming and 
student organizations - are unre-
alistic at best. While a turn toward 
greater fiscal responsibility would 
only benefit the council, removing 
the meager incentive for executives 
to perform their duties and under-
mining thei r ability to make neces-
sary lobbying trips is unwarranted . 

Sweeten offers much more 
appealing alternatives. He con-
tends that Associated Students 
might be better served by placing 
tile burden of senator stipends on 
college council s and embodies the 
importance, if not the immediate 

effi cacy, of lobbying trips; he 
made state newspapers in 
November by walking out on a 
regents meeting with the now-
famous proclamation, "Watch as 
quality walks out the door." 

Kevin Hanson, the Revolution! 
slate's presidential candidate, is 
running with few tangible goals 
other than continuing the work of 
current presidentJenn Pae. This is 
not inherently bad, and Hanson's 
experience as current vice president 
finance qualifies him for the job to 
some degree. Yet his general vision 
for Associated Students is vague 
and impractical. His intention to 
convince the Registration Fee 
Committee to fully fund A.S. staff 
seems fair, but it is unlikely he 
could convince Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Joseph W Watson 
to agree. Similarly, his commit-
ment to moving Associated 
Students toward autonomy is a 
noble long-term goal, but it's 
unknown how he could make 
inroads during a yearlong term. 

It is impossible not to like 
Keshav "Kiki" Boddula, the only 
independent candidate for presi-
dent, but he fails to demonstrate 
knowl edge about the issues intrin-
sic to presidential office. Boddula 
clearly cares about students, as his 
extensive outreach work shows, but 
his self-proclaimed "very idealistic" 
vision for the campus neglects the 

more practical aspects of the posi-
tion, like formulating the councils 
operating budget. 

Sweeten, on the other hand, 
shows none of the naivete, uncer-
tainty or gimmickry of his oppo-
nents. Indeed, he is the only slate 
leader who can truly claim not to 
have run any slate-fillers, an 
admirable position considering the 
prospect for sevenl unqual ified 
candidates on SunGod and 
Revolution' to beat out their bet-
ters. Most importantly, however, 
Sweeten sees the full scope of cam-
pus issues more than any presiden-
tial candidate this year and would 
embody this range of interests in 
everything he does. Students would 
be ill served to allow such quality to 
walk out the door. 

MONDAY, APRIL 4, 2005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5 

Angpla Forner" Vlcp prpsidpnt Intprnal 
F ornero's opponent falls short where she will excel the most 
As the epitome of the 

Revolution l slate's claim to experi-
ence and with a positive reputation 
in Associated Students preceding 
her, Angela Fornero will not disap-
point if elected vice president 
internal. Her idea of focusing 
heavily on accountability should 
improve committee appointments 
and the way in which council 
meetings are run - two of the 
office's main responsibilities. 

Fornero thinks a job done well 
in the internal office might trans-
late to a better image of A.S. 
Council as a whole. Coming off a 
year in which meeting attendance 
was mediocre, excuses for absences 
were common and enthusiasm at 
meetings was at times low, the AS. 
Council needs someone like 
Fornero, whose Irnowledge of the 
body outweighs SunGod Party 

opponent Wayne Klitofslcy's pas-
sion for the position. 

Although both candidates have 
stressed the need for more 
accountability, Fornero's plan is 
more thought-out: The current 
commissioner of enterprise opera-
tions wants AS. representatives on 
important committees such as the 
Registration Fee Committee or 
the Transportation Policy 
Committee to submit reports to 
the council after their meetings, 
and proposes that representatives 
sign a contract so expectations are 
clear. Unlike previous vice presi-
dent internals, Fornero wants to 
implement interviews as part of the 
process to appoint students to 
committees. Finally, as a means of 
raising enthusiasm for Associated 
Students both within and outside 
of the council, Fornero plans to 

organize more sta ff retrea ts, work 
on providing interest cards in the 
Student Organization and 
Leadership Opportunities offices 
and put together better food give-
aways to expand the applicant pool 
and avoid having to "pull teeth" to 
get people involved with the coun-
cil. 

Fornero says she can make 
meetings run more efficiently and 
decrease apathy in student govern-
ment. Despite her own less-than-
stellar attendance record over the 
past year due to conflicts with the-
ater obligations, she cites past vice 
presidential responsibilities in 
Delta Gamma and 20 hours a week 
of experience leading meetings, in 
promising to work with and around 
hectic student schedules and time 
constraints. Fornero also commit-
ted to withdrawing from theater to 

focus on her position if elected. 
Although Fornero's opponent 

has a substantial amount of proce-
dural and leadership experience 
himself - in Alpha Epsilon Pi and 
other student organizations -
there is one crucial difference that 
separates these two candidates: 
Klitofslcy has attended significantly 
fewer A.S. meetings. 

While there are many tasks and 
procedures that can be learned 
once in office, F ornero truly has an 
edge in this category, as running 
meetings is practically half of the 
job description. Fornero's former 
position also gives her more expe-
rience in marketing, which is key 
in accomplishing the goals both 
candidates have for outreach to 
students and solici ting public 
input. Finally, while Klitofslcy's 
support for a second Sun God fes-

tival has no relation to the posi tion 
of vice president internal, Fornero 
actually has concrete plans to 
improve the office. 

It may only be details that set 
these two candidates apart, but 
they're important enough to vote 
F ornero for the office of vice pres-
ident internal. 

Kevin Mann Vicp prpsidpnt Extprnal 
Articulate and knowledgeable, Mann would shine in this office 

In light of the debates over 
traveling costs in the A.S. budget 
for neXT year, if we could send 
only one person on lobbying trips 
to Sacramento and vVashlllgton, 
D.C., we would want it to be 
Kevin Mann from the Student 
Empowerment! slate, thi year's 
campus organizing director in the 
external office. Mann for vice 
president external is one of the 
strongest endor ements we can 
make in this year's A.S. elections. 

In addition to his enthusiasm 
for the posi tion, Mann's qualifica -
tions and ideas are even more 
impressive. After studying models 
at other UCs, he would like to 
expand his office by dividing lob-
bying responsibilities between 
multiple representatives - one 
each at the national, sta te and 
local levels - which would 

breathe new life into lobbying 
efforts. 

Mann would also like to form a 
San Diego Student Association to 
supplemen t the UC Student 
Association and the U.S. Student 

. Association, which cou ld greatly 
help in lobbying local representa-
tives such as Rep. Susan Davis (0-
San Diego), whose congressional 
distri ct include several universi-
ties and colleges. 

Mann also demonstrated a 
clear understanding of the differ-
ences between behind-the-scenes 
lobbyi ng and media-directed pub-
licity stunts, and showed that he 
knows how to apply each effec-
tively to further student causes. 
Mann also understands the 
importance of sending large dele-
gations to regional and national 
conferences to allow UCSD to 

make a showing for itself. 
Perhaps most importa nrly, this 

ca ndidate knows that ed ucation 
should be a nonpartisan issue, and 
ha the passion and per onal com-
mitment to cnsure that legislators 
on every level see it that way . 

Mann's specific plans for the 
office also set him apart from 
Revolution l candi date am Bui, 
who may possess some similar 
ideas but lacks the plans, details 
and confidence apparent in 
Marm's ca ndidacy. If one of Bui's 
top goals is to lobby locally in 
favor of Greek housing, he should 
focus on doing it in his role as 
Inter-Fraterni ty Council presi-
dent, not as A.S. vice president 
external. 

Mann 's other opponent, 
SunGod Party's Karyn Maczka, is 
one of the more disappointing 

candidates in this year's A.S . elec-
tions. Her presentation was 
mediocre at best, and, if nothing 
else, the external office needs a . 
leader capable of making a strong 
Impression. 

Lacking any grasp of student 
issues or the relationship between 
lobbying and A.S. resolution, 
Maczka demonstrates very few, if 
any, of the qualifications neces-
sary for this position, despite per-
sonal ties to several politicians. 
Simply discussing slate talking 
points and ci ting local contacts 
leaves voters to question her 
knowledge of UCSA and US SA. 
She had an equal ignorance about 
the vice president external's cur-
rent officeholder, Ri go Marquez, 
which also indicates a lack of 
interest in the position . 

Finally, both of Mann's oppo-

nents have commi tments else-
where that might hinder their 
ability to focus solely on student 
issues. Candidates like Mann , on 
the other hand , are rare, and 
UCSD needs to take advantage of 
him and elect him as its face and 
voice in San Diego, Sacramento 
and Washington, D.C. 

Erik Ward Vicp prpsidpnt Financp 
Despite some doomed ideas, Ward is pragmatic and experienced 

While our endorsement of 
SunGod vice president finance 
candidate Erik Ward should not be 
construed as a full -scale endorse-
ment of the SunGod platform, 
Ward nonetheless has demonstrat-
ed the experience, vision and prag-
matism needed to serve as the AS. 
vice president finance. Ward's 
commionem to fiscal responsibili -
ty, most notably on the issue of the 
A.S. travel budget, sets him apart 
from Revolution! slate candidate 
Greg Murphy. 

While the Guordian does not 
endorse a wholesale cut of the A.S . 

travel budget, forcing the external 
office to justify its spending on a 
case -by-case basis would set a 
strong example for the rest of the 
council and would likely have little 
effect on A.S. lobbying efforts. 

Ward is also considerably more 
experienced than his opponent, 
with a record of successfully 
implementing the Warren Activity 
Fee as Earl Warren College 
Council Student chair last spring. 
As chair, Ward developed a strong 
budget and prudent budget mech-
anisms from scratch. He was also 
able to reduce the percentage of 

funds spent on administrative 
overhead and increase the per-
centage spent on students, some-
thing from which Associated 
Students could benefit. Because he 
was elected as an independent last 
year, while many members of his 
cabinet were members of a slate, 
we also believe that Ward has the 
ability to be an effective vice pres-
ident finance regardless of who 
else is elected into office. If he is 
elected, the Guardill1l hopes he 
wi 11 use this experience construc-
tively in the next year if other 
SunGod members fail to win. In 

his interview, Ward demonstrated 
commendable pragmatism when 
he noted that it would likely be 
impossible to deliver on reduced 
sti pends and travel budgets if 
SunGod presidential candidate 
Daniel Watts is not elected . In 
pledging to establish fiscal respon-
sibility even if another president is 
elected, Ward sealed the 
GUIlrdilltl 's endorsement. 

That is not to say that Murphy 
is not a qualified candidate. If 
elected, Murphy would likely be a 
steady hand in the vice president 
finance office. However, Murphy 

just doesn'r bring anything to the 
table that Ward wouldn't . .

For AS. Council-funded stu-
dent services, Revolution! slate~ 
Maurice J unious promises to bring 
a rational, outside perspective to an 
office tha t has remained largely 
stagnant and paralyzed in recent 
years. With experience in running 
risk-reduction programs for the 
university's Greek system, Junious 

is well-positioned to address the 
biggest issue facing the next com-
missioner of student services: 
reform of A.S. Safe Rides that will 
make the program both affordable 
and sustainable. 

That said, Junious has offered 
few concrete ideas for improving 
the service, other than continuing 
Commissioner of Student Services 
Kian Maleki's detailed financial 
audit and studying trends in 
demand and use. Junious has made 
clear that ensuring reasonable 
response time for shuttles would be 

a higher priority than returning 
Safe Rides to the Mexican border. 
His other ideas, however, like 
requiring repeated users of the ser-
vices to attend mandatory informa-
tional seminars, are more con-
tentious; similar proposals from 
Maleki died in council last year. 

Unlike Junious, Faina Shalts 
would bring actual student services 
experience to the office. As current 
General Manager of KSDT, how-
ever, it is unclear how much Shalts' 
experience would apply to other 
divisions under the commissioner's 

purview. 
Shalts ' platform offers no 

more details or concrete plans 
than Junious ', though she has 
made clear her own hesitations 
about adding an educational com-
ponent to Safe Rides, opting to 
include literature and handouts 
on the dangers of substance abuse 
in a paclc.et given to students when 
they pick up new Triton Taxi 
stickers. 

On the issue of Student-Run 
Television, both Shalts and Junious 
have pledged to hold the station 

accountable for compliance with its 
charter. Shalts' position, however, 
is more ambiguous, backing free 
speech rights while opposing the 
broadcast of pornography on the 
station. 

Shalts has also pledged to fight 
for fuji funding for the television 
station and KSDT. However, she 
doesn't offer many ideas for how 
these new services would be fund-
ed. Kelly Vasant, a third candidate, 
has withdrawn from the race. She 
has endorsed neither Junious nor 
Shalts. 



6 OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, APRIL -4, 200S 

Harry Khanna vP Academic Affaln; 
Running unopposed, Khanna oozes enthusiasm and ideas 
When Earl Warren College 

changed the grading policy for its 
writing program in fa ll 2003, 
Revolution! slate's unopposed vice 
president of academic affairs can-
didate Harry Khanna toole notice. 
Khanna, a Warren junior, used the 
unpopular change as an impetus to 
get involved in the campus. Two 
years later, it is apparent that 
UCSD has benefited from his 
decision. 

Khanna has accomplished much 
in his tenure at {TCSD, in roles 
ranging from chair of the Warren 
Judicial Board to president of the 
Karaoke Club, and it is his weU-
roundedness that makes him a par-
ticularly attractive candidate for 
vice president C?f academic affairs. 
And he couldn't be more qualified 
for the job: Through his service as 
an undergraduate representative on 

the campus Academic Senate com-
mittees on admissions and academ-
ic freedom, as wdl as the UC-wide 
Academic Senate conunittees on 
libraries and legal filesharing, he 
has demonstrated true Imowledge 
of and passion for the academic 
issues pertaining to the campus. 

But his focus is not limited to 
the big issues; Khanna is in tune 
with the lesser matters that are 
often overlooked, including the 
arbitrary early deadlines for drop-
ping lab classes and the vast dis-
crepancy between college writing 
requirements. Though these 
issues aren't his top priorities, his 
familiarity with them is a neces-
sary prerequisite for finding a 
solution. 

Additionally, as the undergradu-
ate representative on the Academic 
Senate's Committee on Academic 

Freedom, Khanna is well equipped 
to address concerns of professor 
bias on campus, an issue the vice 
president of academic affairs should 
be familiar with. His concerns over 
the Student Bill of Rights, the cur-
rent effort by state Senator Bill 
Morrow (R-38) to curtail pcofessor 
indoctrination of students, are war-
ranted. He cites the need for the 
University of California to be 
autonomous from the state 
Legislature. 

Because he is an appointee to 
Academic Senate committees, 
Khanna is familiar with the 
appointment process the vice pres-
ident of academic affairs is charged 
with and knows that the more 
diverse the student representation 
on a committee is, the better. 

His ultimate goal of improving 
students' lives without sacrificing 

academic quality or integrity is a 
noble one, consistent with the 
spirit of UCSD. And while it is 
true that he is the only candidate 
for the position, he is also, more 
importantly, the right one. 

Eric Morris Commissionpr of Programming 
A programming veteran, Morris is perfect for the job 

It is telling that the only quali-
fied candidate for commissioner of 
programming this year comes not 
from the slate that wants to sweU 
the programming office's budget, 
but from Revolution!, whose candi-
dates oppose the idea of two Sun 
God festivals. For those students 
who see SWl God as the only thing 
Associated Students does for them 
- and for those who, more appro-
priately, recognize it as only one of 
the councils many important duties 
- Eric Morris is the clear choice 
for programming commissioner. 

Instead of advancing half-baked 
promises, Morris offers students 
that which is most important in 
programming: plenty of experience 
and an excellent track record. He 
has worked in the office for three 
years, and currently perfonns the 
important duties of festival coordi-

nator, planning quarterly concerts 
and SWl God itself. More impor-
tantly, Morris has played a role over 
the years in bringing ASUCSD's 
programming office to rival any 
other in the state. Students who 
have enjoyed this year's stdlar line-
up of campus concerts - from 
Social Distortion to Jimmy Eat 
World, from Snoop Dogg to WIlco 
- have Morris and others serving 
under current commissioner of pro-
grarruning Rishi Shah to thank. 

Morris is correct in recognizing 
that to elect someone with no expe-
rience in this office is to risk losing 
years of work building the relation-
ships with agents and promoters 
that have made programming at 
UCSD so superb. 

However, the fear of backsliding 
is hardly all that drives Morris' can-
didacy. He exhibits a great pride for 

the programming office and knows 
the value of developing a staff that 
will carry on the legacy of the past 
years' work. He also understands 
the need to strike the right balance 
between popular and indie acts, as 
exemplified in this year's diverse 
lineup. 

SunGod Party candidate 
Tammie Nguyen, while well-mean-
ing, is simply unqualified to run an 
office of this magnitude. Aside from 
lacking any experience in the pro-
gramming office, she and the 
SunGod slate as a whole base their 
plans for a second Sun God festival 
on far too many "what-ifs," fore-
most of which are unrealistic spon-
sorship goals. While her desire to 
expand the scope of programming 
to include more all-campus events 
like poker and video-game tourna-
ments is fine, deering Nguyen may

MONDAY, APRIL 4, 2005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 7 

Soap I:hum Commissioner of [ornmunir:atioo§ 
Facing an incredibly weak opponent, Chum is the only decent choice 
The commissioner of commu-

nications race is between two can-
didates, neither of whom is espe-
cially strong. However, 
Revolution! candidate Soap Chum 
is by far the better of the two. 
What Chum lacks in passion he 
makes up for in experience: He is 
the current assistant commissioner 
of communications and has served 
on the A.S. Student Organization 
Funding Advisory Board for the 
past two years. 

As assistant commIssIoner 
under current Commissioner of 
Communications Hilary Elder, 
Chum learned firsthand what it 
takes to perform the duties of the 
position effectively and pledges to 

continue Elder's practices. It is the 
responsibility of the commissioner 
of communications to allocate 
funds to the various alternative 
campus publications, making 
knowledge of how the system 
works very important. It is clear 
that Chum possesses this knowl-
edge, and though he has no con-
crete ideas on how to improve the 
allocation process, he does show 
an interest in exploring more effi-
cient models. And Chum vows to 
remain content-neutral in his 
fundjng allocations, a legal must 
for any reasonable candidate. 

Additionally, Churn's plans to 
increase the number of campus 
publications, by encouraging sru-

dent organizations to participate, 
and to improve student access to 
funding make sense; the more pub-
lications there are, the greater the 
number of opportunities students 
have to express their voices. 

A vote for Chum is as much a 
vote against his opponent, 
SunGod Party's Marina 
Rozhansky. With no experience or 
knowledge of the role of the com-
missioner of communications, 
Rozhansky is clearly the wrong 
person for the job. Whereas Chum 
sees the job function of the com-
missioner as one of fund alloca-
tion, Rozhansky believes it goes 
beyond that, giving the position a 
more hands-on role. 

Her idea to bring more advertis-
ing to campus publications is no 
doubt ambitious, but it is also short-
sighted, naive and potentially hann-
ful. She proposes bringing in a pro-
fessional advertising consultant to 
garner ads for publications, which 
could increase the revenue of alter-
native campus publications and thus 
the number of issues each publica-
tion could produce. But she assumes 
too much and is too willing to deny 
publications their autonomy and 
control over ad content. She has 
excessive confidence in something 
she seems to knows nothing about. 
Further, she does not even consider 
the fact that advertising goes against 
much of the culture and ideology 

behind many campus publications. 
Her failings make Chum the only 
choice for commissioner of com-
munications.

MONDAY, APRIL 4, ZOOS THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 9 

Ial i Shot 'sterman [amm. of Enterprise Operations 
Shousterman's innovative ideas make up for her lack of A.S. experience 
Tali Shousterman is a crowd-

pleaser, especially on paper, 
Although she hasn 't held an A.S. 
Council position, she has relevant 
experience tha t will serve her well 
in office - but she emphasizes 
her goals for office over her expe-
rience, and does so for a reason. 
Shousterman , a Sun God Party 
candidate, has an impressive 
array of ambitious projects she 
would like to pursue in office. 
While even she acknowledges 
that some of her ideas will be 
nearly impossible to implement 
(such as the outdoor bar during 
festivals), none are bad ideas. If 
elected, she will see her limits in 
what she can accomplish, but she 
has an ambitious vision and 

enough of an understanding of than presenting pipe dreams as 
A.S. enterprises that she will be campaign promises. We admire

ness models for her office, rather her candidate statement. While 

she had some constructive things 
to say about Angela Fornero, the 
current commissioner, Chen was 
unable to look ahead to the future 
and lacked the detailed, fresh ideas 
that Shousterman is proposing. 
Despite working under Fornero, 
Chen comes across as too inexpe-
rienced and immature to accom-
plish much as commissioner. 

Furthermore, she seems 
unwilling or unable to give any 
details of her plans for the office. 
Give her another year in the 
enterprise office and she might 
learn the skills to manage her staff 
and to campaign effectively; for 
now, she has potential but not planning and research, and her 
much else. Shousterman is miles abili ty to sell her plans to an 3udi-

Eiko Ar§eniak I:ommissioner of Diversity Affairs 
This tireless activist rounds out the Student Empowerment! slate 

{Editor's Note: Rroolutioll! calldi-
M tt Yee Let deC/inrd to be imm;i~ed.} 

Parris Bass of the SunGod 
Party and Eiko Arseniak of 
Student Empowerment! are both 
candidates for commissioner of 
diversity affairs, but the similari-
ties end there. Bass is highly 
enthusiastic, touts himself as a 
Christian, gay, black man, and is 
woefully unqualified for the office; 
Arseniak, on the other hand , is a 
veteran of working on behalf of 
diversity with a soft-s poken 
demeanor and an underwhelming 
self-presentation. 

However, Arseniak's impressive 
track record - including co-chair-

ing the Diversity Awareness 
Committee at Diablo Valley 
College and serving as the current 
chief of staff at the diversity affairs 
office - more than makes up for 
her lack of charisma and overt 
enthusiasm, and makes her a 
promising and experienced candi-
date for the job. Given her creden-
tials , choosing her over Bass 
should be an obvious choice. 

We also liked Arseniak's broad 
view of diversity - very early in 
the interview she pointed out that 
diversity doesn 't deal just with 
race , but also with sexual orienta-
tion, cultural identity and even 
political ideology, and her subse-

quent explanations of her plans 
seemed to reflect this. For 
Arseniak, bridging the gaps 
between various factions on cam-
pus seems to be more than a 
voter-friendly campaign promise; 
she has the chops to do effective 
work toward this goal, such as dis-
couraging cultural graduations 
that feature only one group in 
favor of one multicultural gradua-
tion that emphasizes the similari-
ties between underrepresented 
students. 

Furthermore, she had exciting 
plans for her office, including a 
Cultural Unity Awareness Month, 
a World AIDS Day event and part-

Her opponent has no such 
plans. While charismatic and 
sharply conscious of his own 
minority-within-a-minority status, 
he is unprepared to be effective 
within the office. Ignorant about 
the diversity affairs office and the 
demands of the position, he could 
answer our questions only in the 
vaguest of terms. 

After taking a cue from 
Arseniak and working within the 
diversity affairs office, Bass might 
make a good commissioner, but 
right now he is an obvious slate-
filler for the SunGod Party.

Referenda: All three slates 
support outreach initiative 

continued from page r 
Affirmative Action Committee, 
according to Commissioner of 
Diversity Affairs and Student 
Empowerment! slate presidential 
candidate Christopher Sweeten. 
Currently, some SAAC and SIORC 
representatives overlap, bur meet-
ings are open to everyone inter-
ested in outreach, he said. 

Funds &om D.O.O.R.S . would 
be available to all student orga-
nizations this fall. Using SIORC 
recommendations, A.S. council-
members would divide and distrib-
ute all D.O.O.R.S. money. At the 
marginal price of $3 per quarter 
per student, D.O.O.R.S has faced 
little opposition &om A.S. Council 
members, Pae said. 

AU AS. presidential candidates 
endorsed the referendum during 
debates. Sweeten said that he advo-
cates the plan not only because it 
supports diversity, but also because 
transferring outreach funding to 
new student fees will &ee up money 
in the A.S. budget. 

"Without A.S. having to fund 
S10, we could use that money for 
so many other things," Pae said. 

The same position was echoed 
by the SunGod Party, though 
Revolution ! slate's presidential can-
didate Kevin Hanson said he would 
back keeping the current AS. out-
reach funding as a supplement to 
new funds raised through the ref-
erendum. 

With a Recruitment and 
Retention Center planned in the 
Price Center expansion, turning 
down the D.O.O.R.S. referendum 
would inhibit the center's effective-
ness, Pae said. The center would 
provide multiple student resources, 
including study rooms and the pos-
sibility of peer mentoring, accord-
ing to Sweeten. 

"How are we supposed to have 
that center and no one in it?" 
Pae said. "We need to make sure 
that the center runs efficiently. The 
only way that can realistiCally hap-
pen wi th the sta te cuts and the 
university not giving the allocation 
I believe should be given to lORC 
is this referendum, which was a last 
resort ." 

Opponents believe D.O.O.R.S. 
adds insult to injury in a university 
that has increased student fees by 
65 percent in three years. While she 
supportS the referendum, Pae said, 
she understands how opponents can 
view the possible increase of student 
fees as a "slippery-slope effect." 

"If this referendum is approved, 
how many other groups will want 
to raise fees again?" the statement 
against the referendum asks in the 
A.S. election sample ballot. 

The second referendum present-
ed on the ballot proposes changes 
in the A.S. Council. If approved, 
the A.S. constitutional amendment 
would transfer membership in the 
council &om 24 total college sena-
tors - one per grade level per col-
lege - to 12 total college senators 
- two per colJege - and six cam-
puswide senators. The latter would 
be elected generally by the student 
body in an at-large election. In 
addition, the referendum would 

provide for six &eshman senators, 
one per college, to be appointed by 
the A.S. Council. 

Unlike D.O.O.R.S., the amend-
ment has faced heavy resistance 
and was almost prevented &om 
appearing on the ballot after a nar-
row 13-6-4 vote for approval in the 
A.S. Council. In fact, the referen-
dum would have been defeated if a 
recount of senators' votes had been 
performed, according to Thurgood 
Marshall Sophomore Senator Jason 
Hoskins. 

According to Hoskins, the e-mail 
server rejected the dissenting elec-
tronic vote of John Muir College 
Senior Senator Arman Depanian. 
The vote was then counted as an 
abstention, a1Jowing the referen-
dum to be put on the ballot. 

Pae, who presented the referen-
dum, contends that senators were 
opposed to the proposal for the 
wrong reasons . 

"It was hard for the council 
to distinguish between liking the 
referendum and wanting to at least 
present it on the ballot to let them 
decide by vote," Pae said. 

However, Hoskins believes that 
the vote represented the instabil-
ity of Pae's plan and that the plan 
will do nothing to fix A.S. troubles 
of senator apathy. Senator atten-
dance has been inconsistent at 
A.S. Council meetings, forcing the 
council members to kip bathroom 
breaks to keep quorum. 

"The change i n't going to target 
fixing this problem at all ," Hoslcins 
stated in an e-mail. "[ColJege sena-
tors) go to both AS. meetings and 
college council meetings, so the indi-
viduals who usually are, or should 
be filling these offices are dedicated 
and will go to all the meetings. The 
problem is not \vithin the system, its 
with the people." 

If approved, the A.S. structure 
would allow for senators to be 
impeached, which Pac believes will 
create a system of accOlmtability with 
better representation of the campus. 
However, the referendum language 
on the sample ballot does not men-
tion an impeachment clause. 

"The majority of students don 't 
affiliate with their college and year," 
she said. "This way, the generally 
elected senators cou ld represent 
anyone &om transfer students to 
commuter students. It just creates 
more opportunity." 

Hoskins said that the proposed 
format would allow senators to vote 
on their own impeachment, which 
creates conflict of interest. What 
Pae sees as true campus representa-
tion, Hoskins sees as a possibility 
for selfish politics. 

"People say that the current sys-
tem does include everyone, but it 
may not represent everyone; the 
fact of the matter is that the new 
system won't represent everyone 
either," Hoskins stated. "The cam-
puswide representatives will not be 
an equal representation of everyone 
on this campus. The spots are likely 
to be filled with coalition, special-
interest group representatives."

said, when UC faculty requested 
the social demographic data of 
test-takers and winners. 

Detweiler said the board does 
not keep track of this kind of data . 

She also said discrepancies in 
performance were part of a broader 
national problem and the univer-
sity's accusations were a "waste in 
energy" and a "disservice to the 
educational system." 

"Like alJ Americans, we are con-

said. "They should do something to 
recti IY the causes of disparity, not try 
to cover them over." 

But Hayashi said the issue is 
selecting an academic standard that 
will do the least harm to disadvan-
taged students.

I t's 12:53 p.m. Wednesday, and you've just completed three wearisome bours of class. As you emerge back into the world from the 
depths of Center Hall, the normal warmth and 
sunshine greet you with a more impending reaJ-
iution: You are brmgry. That bageVcoffeelcereaJ 
you bad for brealdiast has left a burning vacancy in 
your gut, threatening to halt your motor abilities 
completely if you don't fill it right now. Since 
you're in the middle of campus, and severely in 
need of sustenance, it's off to Price Center, for a 
bite from one of the slick. well-lit fast food joints 
that line the ground and second floors. 

Now here's the rub: If you're like some of us, 
who spend many extracurricular hours on campus 
each week, you may 6nd yourself in this apensive 
situation fairly often. It begs the question: Euetly 
bow healthy is the food they serve in these places? 
When you eat at least one or two meals a day on 
campus, it's hard not to eat at Price Center some-
times, just out of basic need for variety - which 
means that the health of food (and availability of 
decent food) at Rubio's, Wendy's, Subway, Panda 
Express and, soon, Tacone Wnps, is of somewhat 
mortal importance. 

So we decided to check out the basic nutrition

T he fact that the most common drive-through . restaurant in Louisiana serves frozen daiquiris should be your first clue. It is true that in dear 
Louisiana, drunk driving and open-container laws 

still apply, but the police define an unopened straw as an 
unopened container when it comes to the drive-thru 
daiquiris. Most patrons request two straws. 

New Orleans - a city eight feet below sea level , where 
they bury their dead above ground for fear of coffins skid-
ding out to sea, where eccentricity is encouraged and 
admired, where voodoo and Catholicism hold hands on the 
park benches, where the second most common language is 
French, where the playful jocularity of a weekend clam-
bake transcends the confines of Saturday and Sunday and 
howls through the week - is a city that is at once wild and 
crazy and mysterious. The famous Bourbon Street and 
Canal Street are only part of the "N'awlins," French 
Quarter ambiance. For tourists, they are the destination, 
and they are never lacking for a good time. At any given 
time of day, tourists can purchase feather boas and Mardi 
Gras beads to prepare for the night, hop into the nearest 
voodoo shop and still have time for a little jazz, blues, 
gospel and zydeco to polish off the day.

Local hostels maintain the normal levels of accessibility 

and cleanliness that young travelers have come to expect: 
dingy with a side of unpredictability. Cairo Pete 's

$15 a night per person. The equally accessible India House 
International Hostel is located on 124 South Lopez, which 
is just a few steps from Bourbon Street and costs about 
$17.50 a night. Hostels can range from extremely nice to 
horrifying, so it is best to call ahead and see what the con-
ditions are like. Really, the hoste l should just be a place to 
leave your bags; all of the sights, sounds and tastes of this 
Cajun spectacle should keep everyone out all night long. 

fOOD 
Because the N'awlins diet cons ists so heavily of fish and 

spices, the cuisine tends to be a little on the expensive side 
for those on a budget. Should one partake, the Olde 
N'awlins Cookery is right off Bourbon Street and is mod-
erately priced, from about S 11 to $20 a plate. Another fan-
tastic eatery is the Red Fish Grill, which is also located on 
Bourbon Street. Its sweet-potato catfish is a safe alternative 
for those who fear Cajun spices. New Orleans is a port, so 
the fi sh are fresh and the fires are always burning. 

RCTIUITIES 
When the sun goes down , there is only onc place to be, 

and that is the French Quarter. The writhing debauchery 
that has made Mardi Gras so famous is simply a taste for 
the uninitiated. In truth, Bourbon Street is wild every 
night, with few exceptions. Drinlcing in the streets is 
expected, flying beads arc expected and partial nudity 
hould be expected. It is a fairly lax environment, so those 

travelers who are underage can still have a good time. If the 

dnmken displays become roo much, there is an entire cul-
ture of jazz to be explored. A visit to the original House of 
Blues, where there is live music every night, makes a trip to 
New Orleans complete. 

TRRnsPORTRTlon 
New Orleans is an intoxicating and accessible city. By 

plane, boat, bus or cab, transportation is always cheap and 
handy. rt is also a very dense city, so navilf<lting by foot is 
possible and a little more interesting and culturally excit-
ing. 

Off THE BERTEn TRRCK 
If you want to soak up a little more of Louisiana 's cul-

ture and history, the most interesting side trips are to the 
bayou . They are relatively cheap, about $40 a person, and 
usually include a bus ride, a riverboat ride and a detour to 
one of the old plantations. T he riverboat guides arc 
friendly and often have pet alligators and crabs. T hey will 
take you into thc heart of the swamps, wa rn you omi-
nously about chiggers (nasty bugs that burrow into your 
skin) and give you long histories of Louisiarla and the 
bayous. 

T he delicacies of the swamp include a burger stand with 
questionable government cleanliness ratin gs, but if you're 
not hungry, you can visit the gift: shop and plLfchase alliga-
tor heads and alli lf<ltor claw back-scratchers. It's all part of 
the experience - even the backwoods (or back-swamp, for 
that maner) characters you run into will give you a taste of 
what Louisiana is aU about.

Do--it.-yourself car repair for small budgets 
Learn how to change tires and oil without having to pay 

By VANESSA PENG 
Staff writer 

C ollege drivers often neglect car problems and necessary automobile 
checks because of the high cost 
associated with them. But a little 
preventative maintenance can 
save you a bundle in the long run . 

H ere are some easy proce-
dures to pro tect the condition of 
personal ve hicles that can be 
done in the convenience of your 
own driveway. 

TIRE CHANGE 

[n order to change a tire, you 
mu t have a jack, a lug-nut 
wrench and a spare tire . 

I. Loosen all of the lug nuts 
with the }'french, but do not 
remove them. 

2. Place the jack under a stable 
and strong lifting point on the 
front, back or side. 

3. Lift the car to a suitabl e 
height, where you can easi ly 
remove the existi ng tire and 
replace it with the spare . 

4. Remove the lug nuts and 
the tire, and put the spare tire on 
the em pty axle 

5. Put the lug nuts back on 
and hand-tighten . 

6 . Drop the car, remove the 
jack and tighten the lug nuts to 
75 to 95 pounds of force (put 
your own weight on it; thi s 
should be enough). 

OIL CHANGE 

To perform an oil change, you 
will need an oil filter wrench and 
something to catch the draining 
oil , like a pan or a bucket. You 

will also need a wrench for the 
drai n plug. 

"On most Japanese vehides, 
such as Hondas and Mitsubishis, 
it's a 17 -millimeter wrench, but 
the majQrity of sizes are 14-
through 19-millimeter wrench-
es," Fullerton-based mechanic 
Adrian Simut said. 

I . Sta rt by warming up the 
cn r. T he hotter the oil is, the 
faster it will drain . 

2. Remove the oi l cap and 
check fo r recommended oil levels. 

3. Remove th e drain plug 
underneath the engine - make 
sure it's the engine'S drain plug 
and not the transmission's. Have 
a pan or bucket to catch the oil 
for disposal. 

4. Remove the oil filter, either 
with an oil filter wrench or by 
hand (the latter is much more 
difficult). 

5. Repla ce the oi l filt er with 
either a generic part or that of a 
brand such as Fram or Mobil. 

6. Rub some oi l on the filter 
rubber o-ring for easier installa-
tion. 

7. Tighten the oil fil ter one-
and-a-half turn after it starts to 
feel incredibly tight. It doesn't 
need to be super-tight : Keep in 
mind that you will have to 
remove it during the next oil 
change. 

S. Tighten the drain plug at 
around 15 pounds of force and 
spray brake part cleaner to 
remove any excess oil (this is 
optional). 

9. Most ca rs will take around 4 
quarts of oil. It is always better to 
use the manufacturer's recom-
mended viscosity. Once the oil 
has been poured, check the oil 
level. 

The Muir Musical Ensemble 

10. If the oil level is in the safe 
zo ne, start the ca r and let it run 
for 30 seconds or so. T his will 
disperse the oil throughout the 
entire engine. 

11. Shut off the engine and 
check the level again . \Vhile you 
have the hood up, you can also 
check the brake fluid, which is in 
front of the brake pedal. 

FLUID CHECKS 

The power steering fluid tank 
on most cars is located next to the 
serpentine belts, though on some 
domestic vehicles it is found to the 
side. The cap is typically black. 

The fluid in the radiator expan-
sion tank, located near the radia-
tor, must be kept at the indicated 
level on the side of the tank. T he 
expansion tank can be found by 
following the small hose under-
neath the radi ator cap. Windshield 
wiper fluid isn't as important as all 
the others, but it should still be 
checked. This tank can be refilled 
with special windshield wiper fluid 
found in any auto parts store or 
gas station, or a glass cleaner like 
Windex.

Health: Panda and Rubio's do 
have some healthy options 

cominued fTOm page 1 1 
tasty meals at a variety of prices. 
But as with most Mexican food, 
that tastiness comes from- two 
places : fat and salt. At 970 ca.lo-
ries, with 37 grams of fat and 274 
mg of sodium, the Especial Carne 
Asada burrito isn't something 
most of us probably want to eat aU

McCracken, athletes and the 
superactive could eat such a meal 

" 

some of its hea lthiest. Both 
Chicken with Mushrooms and 
Beef with Broccoli are 150 calo-
ries or less. At Panda, McCracken 
advises getting the brown rice 
instead of the nutrient-stripped 
white or fat-rich fried options . At 
70 calories, and 3 grams of fat, 
Mixed Vegetables is another fa irly 
healthy Panda item. 

At the allegedly healthy sand-
wich joint Subway, the decision to

option, Rubio's 
offers the Carne 
Asada "s treet 
tacos," which, with 
100 calories and 
3.5 grams of fat 
each, are not too 
bad for most of us. 
T he H ealth-Mex 

At 970 calories

dependent on 
how you dress

the Especial Came

Of course 
choosing an item 
like the Meatba ll 
Marinara sub, or 
the Chicken 
Bacon Ranch sub, 
will starr you off 
pretty heavily 
with 560 and 530 to eat all the time. " 

Chicken Salad, 
with 22 0 calories and also 3.5 
grams of fat, is even better. 

Any Price Center regular 
knows that Panda Express is often 
the restaurant with the longest 
line - sometimes it even curls its 
way frighteningly close to the 
door of the food court. This 
Chinese hot-plate franchise cooks 
up a filling and tasty plate for a 
barely-reasonable price given the 
quality; but as with its Mexican 
counterpart. that popularity is 
easy to attribute. Orange 
Chicken, Panda Express' most 
popular dish by far, is also its least 
healthy, at 480 calories, 21 grams 
of fat and SO milligrams of sodium 
per serving. Fortunately, some of 
Panda's tastiest dishes are also

Savory Turkey Breast, at 280 calo-
ries, and Veggie Delite, at 230 
calories, make Subway a good 
option for those looking for 
something more hea lthful. Again, 
McCracken urges choosing the

MONDAY, APRIL of, ZOOS lliE UCSD GUARDIAN 

. Are you a true Los Angelean? 
Being a native means knowing the streets 

Obey 
Jiant 

Jia C;u 

L OS Angeles. There's no end to the snickers, put downs and sighs of disgust I receive 
when I reveal to people the city of 
my origins. Los Angeles carries 
many a terrible myths spawned by 
its poor people in poor traffic with 
poor manners. Yet the grossest 
misconception of Los Angeles is 
shared by those who think they're 
actually from Los Angeles - but 
aren't. 

Your local newspaper may read 
Lor Angeltr Timtr, but that in no 
way affiliates you wi th the actual 
city. Check the area code. Is it 
213,310 or 323? Then you're not 
from Los Angeles, or even within 
the grace distance of a quarter 
mile. The power of association 
extends only so far, and it certain-
ly doesn't extend to 714. If you see 
OC anywhere, then you're from 
Orange County. We in L.A. would 
never dignify your existence with 
an acronym. We gave you a televi-
sion series and all our sorority 
girls - what more do you want) 
Even by Los Angeles standards, 
this is greed far beyond the call of 
duty. 

If you reside in cities like 
Huntington Beach, Valencia, 
Irvine, Pomona, Fullerton, 
Diamond Bar and Calabasas, the 
worst of all dystopias, you're not a 
Los Angelean. You're a leech. 

Still not sure if you're a Los 
Angelean? Try this quiz. What 

does Sepulveda Boulevard, Laurel 
Canyon, 6th Street, Riverside 
Drive and Chandler Boulevard all 
have in common? They combine 
to create a grid of alternate routes 
to take when traffic along the 101 
or 405 promises to be a long day's 
night. You need to mow that. If 
you don't mow that the natural 
cycle of traffic is from seven in the 
morning until six in the evening, 
with low tide around 9 a.m. and 
high tide at noon and 5 p.m., then 
in no way can you call yourself 
Los Angelean. That's life-or-death 
information. 

Granted, when I was in high 
school I lived in Burbank (studio 
home of Jay Leno) and went to 
Taft High School, both cultural 
wastelands of the worst variety. 
But unlike my peers (yesterday 
and today), who spent many a 
nights shopping for Gucci on 
eDay, I at least participated in Los 
Angeles culture. And I did it the 
right way too - which was to sex 
up and sell out. 

Most importantly, I drove -
outside the bubble of Burbank. I 
took the back alleys in 
Hollywood. I pumped gas in the 
seedy areas of downtown. I found 
parlc.ing on Sunset, and I mow the 
Metro line like I mow my own 
bilc.ini line. 

I'm an active resident of that 
city and feel absolutely justified in 
citing it as my home town. Unlike 
the half of you wno have never 
been to Watt's Towers, Canter's, 
Bergamot Station, Toi's, Little 
Ethiopia or the Museum of 
jurassic Technology. 

Worst of all are those who 
don't know a single thing about 
Los Angeles, but feel inclined to 

spread terrible slander about 
"great places" to check out. 

Stop telling visitors to check 
out the Getty Museum. As far as 
museums go, it's a blinding white 
ivory tower perched above the 
405, overloolc.ing a brown, semi-
visible orchard to the east and a 
clover shaped garden to the west. 
Sure, the visitor may experience a 
small sense of smug satisfaction at 
the fact that they are surrounded 
by majestic, overrated art from the 
late-Renaissance to the 194Os. But 
they don't realize that once 
they've had their fill of plump 
cherubs and equally plump nudes, 
they'll be crawling fulJ force back 
into that jungle of a freeway sys-
tem. 

What did you expect? The 
only route to the Getty is the 405 
(be quiet those of you who mow 
the other way), considered by 
many - both wide and far - as 
the worst freeway in the world. 
My friend in Anatolia, Turkey 
mows this. Why don't you, my 
so-called Angelean? 

There are a million better 
things to do in Los Angeles, even 
if you're under 21 (unlike San 
Diego, where there are two). You 
can eye porn stars in the San 
fernando Valley, the porn capital 
of the world (La Jolla is one too-
seriously). You can go gallery-
hopping late Friday evenings with 
the subway system. And you can 
attend concerts, sometimes VIP if 
you're the right gender and you 
rub shoulders (or more) the right 
way. 

So what does it mean to be Los 
Angelean? Hit the streets. Don 
your cigarette . Pick up L.A. 
Weekly and check your tan line.

Tritons beat USC, fall to Pepperdine 
Adam Toren's 18 kills lift men's volleyball over Trojans 

By RAiL ENTEEN 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's volleyball 
team split a pair of matches this 
week, falling to the top-ranked 
Pepperdine Waves in srraight sets 
April 2 after an impressive win 
over No. 15 USC on March 30. 

T he Waves (18-2 overall, 
18-2 Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation) are the No. I team 
in the country and played like 
they deserve the honor, wiping 
out the Tritons (2-20 overall, 1-
17 MPSF), 30-28,30-18,30-26. 

UCSD held on in game one, 
keeping it close until late in the 
game, but the Waves managed 
to outhit the Tritons, leading to 
their 30-28 victory. Pepperdine 
led off wifh a 15-10 advantage, 
but the Tritons fought back to tie 
it up, 20-20. The Waves took a 
small lead once again, 24-20, only 
to watch the Tritons get even, 26-
26. With game one up for grabs, 
the Waves rose to the occasion 
and took the game on a kill by 
their leading scorer, Sean Rooney, 
who had 18 kills and a .73 9 anack 
percentage. 

A fte r the clo e first game, 
the next one was a bust as the 
Waves crashed on the Tritons. 
Pcpperdine hit .65 2 compared to 
UCS D's .094 attack percentage. 
Except for an earl y 5-7 Tri ton 
Jdvantage, the Waves were in 
control throughout. T hey went 
on a 5-0 run to take a 10-7 lead 
only to expand it to 20- 13 before 
end ing the game With a 10-5 run 
and a 30- 18 final score. 

,arne th ree starred close, with 
UCS D stayi ng withi n a point of 
the Waves, who led 11 -10. A 4-
I run made it 15 - II , and then 
Pepperdine put on the afterburn-

ers for the home stretch. The 
Waves stayed in front and UCSD 
never came closer than three 
points, finally losing game three, 
30-26, and the match, 3-0. 

The Waves dominated the 
match with a .427 to .228 attack 
advantage and had 31 digs com-
pared to UCSD's 21. Pepperdine 
also outblocked the Tritons, 8-
5. Senior middle blocker Adam 
Rusch, who had nine kills, led 
UCSD. Despite falling to the 
No. I Waves, the Tritons man-
aged their biggest upset of the 
season earlier in the week, win-
ning their first MPSF match over 
USc. The Trojans (6-20 overall, 
3-16 MPSF) were ranked 15th 
and were the favorite to win the 
match. 

The Tritons were not intimi-
dated and led off game one with 
a 0-4 run. The lead didn't last, as 
USC came back to tie the game 
at ten apiece. The teams stayed 
close until the end, with neither 

squad talcing more than a three-
point advantage. Senior outside 
hitter Adam Toren ended game 
one with one of his 18 kills and 
UCSD took a 1-0 lead. 

In the second game, USC took 
an early lead and kept it. UCSD 
kept it close but never took a siz-
able lead. USC had a 24-19 lead 
at one point but the Tritons made 
it 24-25 after another Toren kill. 
USC scored six of the final eight 

_ points to win the game, 30-27, 
and tie up the march. 

Games three and four went 
the Tritons' way, with game three 
ending at 27-30 and the final 
game finishing 25-30. Game three 
was very close but the Tritons 
maintained one- and two-point 
leads until the very end when they 
won the game. With the match on 
the line in game four, the Tritons 
attacked the Trojans with feroc-
ity. They led during the game and 
held off a 5-0 Trojan run to win 
the game and the match.

No. 12 golf places seventh 
at Coyote Invitational 

By JOE SPANO 
Senior Staff Writer 

After taking some time off for 
spring break, the Tritons returned 
to action at the Cal State San 
Bernardino Coyote Invitational at 
Shandin Hills Golf Course in San 
Bernardino, Calif" on March 28 and 
March 29. UCSD finished seventh 
in a field of 12 teams, narrowly miss-
ing a four-way tie for fourth. 

As a team, UCSD came out 
firing in the early round on March 
28, posting a score of 295, which 
only dropped a little to 298 in 
the second round of the day. The 
Tritons were not going to lie down 
though, and on March 29 they 
returned to shoot a 287, the lowest 
score of the day and a below-par 
average for the squad. 

California Collegiate Athletic 
Association rival Cal State Stanislaus 
used the strength of its first round, 
a paltry 280, to propel itself to first 
place, adding on two rounds of 291 
for a total of 862, 2 under par. 
Second-place honors went to St. 
Martin's College, which turned in 
rounds of 292, 293 and 290, for a 
final score of 875 . The top three 
was rounded out by Sonoma State, 
whose score of 877 came via rounds 

of 289, 295 and 293. 
Fourth place was shared 

by three teams, Grand Canyon 
University (292, 297, 289), Point 
Lorna Nazarene (293, 294, 291) and 
Western Washington University 
(290, 297, 291), which all netted a 
total of 878. 

Individually, senior Brian 
Duckworth is beginning to find the 
top 10 a familiar place. Duckworth 
shot a 70 and 75 on March 28, 
and returned on the next day to 
put together another 70, which 
resulted in a I-under-par 215 and 
an eighth-place finish. 

Fellow senior Joe Dolby was 
right on Duckworth's heels, net-
ting a 218, which earned him a tie 
for II th place. Dolby turned in 
rounds of 74 and 73 on March 28 
and shot a 71 on March 29. 

The three remaining mem-
bers of the team - juniors Justin 
Grant (74,77,74) and Ryo Yamada 
(77, 75, 73) and freshman Chris 
Hirahatake (77, 75 and 73) - all 
earned themselves scores of 225, 
good enough to give them a tie for 
36th place. 

The Tritons will hit the links 
again on April 4 and AprilS when 
they participate in the Sonoma 
State Invitational.

Softball goes 1-1 to 
start tournament 

By MICHAEL SCHOECK 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD softball team split 
its first two games of the Easton 
Tournament of Champions hosted 
by Cal State Stanislaus in Modesto, 
Calif. , on April J. The Tritons 
won game one by a 5 -4 score over 
Seattle University but dropped 
its nightcap with a 3-2 score to 
Western Oregon. 

"We played really well," head 
coach Patricia Gerckens said. 

Game one turned into a roller-
coaster ride for the Tritons. UCSD 
clinched the victory on its last at 
bat, when sophomore third base-
man Melanie Meurer plated fresh-
man outfielder Randelle Bundy 
with a single u.p the middle. 

"Bases were loaded and Bundy 
scored a key run on the last hit," 
Gerckens said. 

Bundy entered the game as a 
pinch runner for junior outfielder 
Niki Anderson, who reached on an 
error by the second baseman with 
one out. 

Junior outfielder Jenny Spencer 
went 3-for-4 u~th one run scored 
and one RBI, while junior short-

stop Desiree Franciscus went 2-
for-3 with a run scored and two 
RBIs. Senior catcher Jamie Hurst 
added two hits in the win for the 
Tritons. 

Game two proved difficult for 
the Tritons, despite the fact that 
they managed to score two runs in 
the fourth inning to knot the score 
at two apiece. 

Western Oregon scored the 
heartbreaking go-ahead run in the 
bottom of the fihh inning and 
held its ground to clinch the vic-
tory. 

Spencer, Franciscus, Hurst and 
senior outfielder Breanne Cope 
each had one hit apiece to comprise 
the four UCSD hits. 

Cope's hit was a two-run triple 
that tied the score in the fourth 
inning. 

The team was back in action 
April 2 for day two of the 
Tournament of Champions with 
the Tritons taking on Chaminade 
University, followed by a matchup 
with Western New Mexico. Results 
were unavailable at press time. 

The Tritons return to action at 
home on April 8 against Cal State 
Dominguez Hills at I p.m. 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Stats: Eyes can deceive 
when watching baseball 

continued from page :10 
Perhaps the most basic of 

these principles is that our 
eyes can deceive us. As is often 
noted, the difference between 
a .300 hitter and a .280 hitter 
is only about a hit every two 
weeks. This means that you can 
watch a player or a team for a 
whole season or even multiple 
seasons and still not be able to 
tell the good hitters from the 
merely average. 

This problem is even more 
pronounced with fielding; some 
players, such as Yankees' short-
stop DerekJeter or A's outfield-
er Eric Byrnes, make a lot of 
flashy, diving plays that better 
shortstops or outfielders would 
just make without any trouble. 
Without checlcing the stats, it's 
impossible to know for sure 
how any player rtlllly compares 
to his counterparts. 

Another fundamental tenet is 
that anything can happen over 
a short period of time. Other 
sports like to talk about parity, 
but in no other sport do even 
the best teams win less than 70 
percent of their games and even 
the worst teams win two out of 
approximately every five. 

So whether we're talking 
about a promising roolcie who 
struggles in his first start or a 
team that reels off a hot April, 
remembe.r that anyone can hit 
anything in enough at bats. 
Remember last April, when 
Twins pitcher and American 
League Cy Young winner Johan 
Santana had a 5.40 ERA in 28 
innings? Or two seasons ago, 
when the Kansas City Royals 
surged out of the gate only to 
fade down the stretch? There's 
a reason why they play 162 
games in baseball, and it's to get 
past the flulcish highs and lows 
that every player and team/oes 
through over the course 0 the 
season to truly separate out the 
good from the bad. 

So next time you're at a game 
or preparing for your fantasy 
draft, don't forget to take a look 
at the stat sheet instead of just 
making a pick based on that one 
time you saw a guy play on lV. 
And when you're pinning your 
team's pennant hopes on that 
rookie who came up and set the 
world on fire last September, 
remember that anyone can hit 
anything in a couple hundred 
at-bats.

conrinwtd from JIO«e :I 0 
The Tritons struggled to plate 

a run in the matchup. Recording 
just two hits in the seven-inning 
game, UCSD was shut out for 
just the second time in the 2005 
season. 

Pitcher Marquis Fleming 
(2-2) went the distance for the 
Warriors, pitching seven innings, 
yielding no runs and two hits. 

UCSD junior hurler Byron 
Grubman (1-2) suffered the loss 
for the Tritons, giving up four runs 
on four hits and striking out two. 

In the first half of the double-
header, the Tritons jumped out to 
an early lead and held on to the 
advantage to win, 9-8. 

In the Tritons' fifth, Lawson 
singled and advanced to second 
on an error. UCSD senior des-
ignated hitter Joel Clark reached 
safely on another Warrior error 
as Lawson scored. Hernandez 
then tripled, scoring Clark, and 
Morehead hit a sac fly for UCSD's 
third run of the inning to make it 
5-1 Tritons. 

Cal State Stanislaus' designated 
hitter Jason Louis led off the sixth 
inning with a home run to left 
field to make it 5-2 . Rightfielder 
Tony Marx doubled and would 
later score to bring the Warriors 
within two runs of the Tritons. 

But in the Triton half of the 
sixth inning, UCSD extended 
its lead when Morehead hit a 
three-run home run to give him 
five RBIs in the game, as UCSD 
scored four times to lead 9-3. 

The Warriors rallied for five 
runs in the eighth inning to cut 
the deficit to 9-8, but would come 
up short after Triton pitcher Ryan 
Leake came on to record the fina l 
out of the eighth. 

UCSD junior hurl er T .C . 
Geach (2-0) pitched 7.1 innings 
for the Tritons to earn the win . 
Shlomo Lipetz (2-3) pi cked up his 
fourth save of the season when he 
got the T ritons out of a jam in the 
ninth inning, stranding Cal State 
Stanislaus' potential tying run at 
third base . 

In the series opener, the 
Tritons, down 2-1 in the eighth 
inning, rallied to tie the game 
when senior shortstop Keith 
Hernandez doubled to right-cen-
ter field and sophomore catcher 
David Morehead singled to put 
runners at the corners. Freshman 
first baseman Chris Hom singled 
and scored Hernandez. But UCSD 
could not capit-;Uize and hit into 
an inning-ending double play to 
begin the ninth tied at 2-2 . 

Still tied at the end of regula-
tion, the Tritons and Warriors 
battled in extra innings. Cal State 
Stanislaus scored twice in the top 
of the 11 th on a double by first 
baseman Jeren Livernois. The 
Trirons rallied in the bottom half, 
scoring one run and putting the 
potential tying run aboard, but 
UCSD's rally fell short and the 
Tritons dropped the game, 4-3 . 

UCSD senior leftfielder Craig 
King and junior outfielder Matt 
Lawson led the Tritons with three 
hits apiece. Hom and senior short-
stop Alex Gascon each added two 
hits. 

The Warriors 'Jeremy Hickman 
(I-I) earned the win and the loss 
went to UCSD's senior closer 
Lipetz. For the Tritons, junior 
starter Jose Navarro pi tehed a 
strong eight and a third innings, 
with two earned runs, four hits 
and six strikeouts. 

The Tritons are back in action 
on April 6 when they take on Cal 
State Dominguez. Hills for the 
second time this year. The first 
pitch is slated for 2 p.m. at Triton 
Baseba ll Stadium.

Women's tennis falls· to Wildcats 
By EVAN WANG 
Senior Staff Writer 

After suffering its first two losscs 
of the season in succession over 
spring break, dle UCSD women's 
tennis team appears to have righted 
the ship, going 2-1 since then with 
a 12-3 overall record for the sea-
son. 

On April 2, the team fell 
ro the 12th-ranked Abilene 
Clui tian University Wildcats, 4-
5, in the semifinals of the 2005 
Xenia Anastasiadou M emorial 
Tournament at Cal Poly Pomona. 
The Tritons, ranked lOth in the 
nation, have lost to all three of the 
top- IS teams they have faced this 
season. (West Florida and Barry 
were the other two schools.) 

"\"'e were very close with dlcm," 
head coach Liz LaPlante said. "The 
match could have gone either way. 
It came down to a third- et singles 
match. All in all, ir was great tennis 
by everybody. If there's such thing 
as a good loss, dus was it." 

The Wildcats took two of 
the three doubles matches, with 
Summer Beesley and Rachel Taylor 
taking down UCSD sophomore 
Marsha Malinow and junior Tara 
Siddiqui at the No. I spot, 7-9, and 
Lana Pavlin and Holly Lindloff 
defeating UCSD sophomores Katie 
McKee and Kristen Bronowicki, 1-
8, at the No. 2 spot. Triton senior 
Jasmin Dao and junior Marissa 
Hilker picked up a 8-5 win over 
ACU's Lauren Yarbrough and 
Meagan Brownat the No. 3 spot. 

The extra victory in doubles 
play proved to be the difference in 
the match, as the two teams split 
singles play evenly, 3-3. Malinow, 
Dao and junior Leigh Roberts 
picked up wins. Hilker, Siddiqui 
and McKee all fell .

happen after a great weekend of 
racing againsr a strong ream li ke

The next weekend, UCSD was 
able to find ou t exactly how they 
compared to the besr schools in 
the nation. On April 2 and April 3, 
teams from across the narion met 
at Mission Ba y for rhe San Diego 
Crew Classic. The event is the 
first big race for most teams, and 
offe rs many sc hools the oppor-
tunity to compere in some of the 
best weather cond ilions in the 
country. 

Th~ top teams competi ng in 
the tournamenr were Gonzaga , 
Univer icy of Minnesota, UCLA, 
Trinity, 'Cal State Long Beach 
and UC Berke ley. The Tritons 
struggled again t these teams dur-
ing the first heats on April 2, but 
the novice-eight boat finished in 
second during tile Derek Guelker 
Memo rial Cup, the race for the 
Men's Collegiate Novice "A" 
boats. 

UC D finished in second, 
cruising in at 6:30.87 . UC Berkeley 
finished in first at 6:03 .7, and UC 
Davis clocked in after the Tritons 
in third at 6:36.2 1. After placing in 
the top two, the UCSD novice boat 
qualified for the grand final . 

Besides the novice-eight boat's 
tremendous finish, the team was 
not pleased with its racing during 
the heats. 

"The team did not race the 
way they co\,ld," Davis said. 
"Fortunately, they got another day 
to race and another chance to show 
they can compete. The team knew 
they could have done bener on 
Saturday. They definitely proved 
that on Sunday." 

T he varsity-eight boat finished 

in firsr in the Men's Cal Cup Petite 
Final on April 3. The team clocked 
in at 6:07 .8 and beal Washington

"I had no doubr that the team

"I believe they had the best per-
formance of the weekend," Da\~ s 
said. "Nobody would have ever 
realized that everyone in our nov-

time in their lives. They are all 
walk-on athletes who have never 
rowed before." 

Davis is satisfied with hi s team's 
progress. 

"We are having a great season," 
Davis said. "And we arc showing

Men's crew blanks Santa Clara 
Tritons win all four races, improve to 3-0 

By MICHAEL NEUSTEDTER 
Staff Writer 

The UCS D men's crew 
team proved that it could race 
with the elite after its dominat-
ing performance against Santa 
Clara University on March 25 at 
the Lex.ington Reservoir in Los 
Gaw , Calif. The team swept all 
four races against the Broncos and 
improved its record to 3-0. 

"We actually beat them by 
more than we thought we would," 
varsity coach Mark Davis said. 
"The varsity-eight boat team fin -
ished over twelve seconds ahead 
ofSC at a time of seven minutes, 
20.7 seconds. When taking into 

- account the fact that we were tired 

from having to travel all the way 
up to Northern California, I reaUy 
did not thinlc that we would have 
had such a solid race." 

Santa Clara beat University of 
San Diego and Loyola Marymount 
University earlier in the season and 
also finished very closely behind 
two of the top teams in California, 
UC Davis and UC Berkeley. 

"This race was a chance for 
us to compare ourselves to some 
of the stronger teams in our divi-
sion," Davis said. 

The varsity-eight boat was not 
the only team to finish excep-
tionally ahead of the Broncos. 
There was a 48-second difference 
between finishes in the novice-
eight boat race. UCSD finished in 

6:30.3, and Santa Clara cruised in 
considerably later at 7:18.3. 

"Santa Clara had some pret-
ty superior individual athletes," 
freshman oarsman Ryan Tool 
said. "But we looked much bet-
ter as a team. We realized that 
we could compete with Davis and 
Berkeley because we had similar 
finishes against Santa Clara." 

UCSD also raced two boats in 
the novice-four. The "A" boat fin-
ished at 7:33.3, and the "B" boat 
clocked in at 7:43.9. The Broncos 
cruised in shortly after the "B" 
boat at 7:46.8. 

"The whole team is pretty con-
fident that we can beat anyone

Baseball is here! After five months of waiting, the boys of summer will once 
again take to the field for the 
152nd straight year. And what 
better way to celebrate that grand 
ole tradition than by holding a 
fanta sy baseball draft? Now, 1 
hadn 't played fantasy baseball for 
a couple of years - after all, it's 
life-consuming and causes non-
baseball fans to look at you funny. 
But when a co-worker of mine 
approached me with an invitation 
to join a $25 buy-in fantasy base-
ba ll league, it was a perfect union 
of two of my three favorite vices: 
sports and gambling. How could 
I say "no"? 

Especially when my under-
standing of baseball has come such 
a long way si nce first playing fan-
tasy baseball in 10th grade. I have 
a confession to make: I'm a stats 
geek. And whi le it' a ti tle not 
embraced by many, it's a quality I 
felt would give me the adva ntage 
1 needed to win a couple hundred 
bucks, and that was reason enough 
for me to jump on the chance to 
get on board. 

H ow did I become a baseball 
sta ts geek? Fittingly, it began with 
looking for ways to get ahead in 
fantasy baseball. After joining my 

first fantasy baseball league way 
back when, I began watching as 
many games as 1 could on TV 
and reading as many stories as I 
could on ESPN.com, when I for-
tuitously came across noted stats-
oriented ESPN columnist Rob 
Neyer, who di pelled many of the 
myths that to this day are deeply 
held by many baseball fans : that 
wins and losses are important for 
a pitcher, that batting average and 
RBIs are the most important stats 
for a hitter and that the sacrifice 
bunt with no one out is a noble 
play. Before long, I discovered 
Baseball Prospectus (http://www. 
baseball prospectus. com), a group of 
part-time baseball statisticians 
who have developed revolutionary 
ways of eva luating players. The 
next thing 1 knew, "Moneyball ," 
the story of Oakland A's general 
manager Billy Beane, was on the 

ew York Times best-seller list and 
sophisticated stats analysis was in 
the mainstream. 

Of course, being a tats geek 
doesn't mean that I spend all 
my time with my nose tuck in 
preadsheets and ignore the actu-

al game. Understanding the stats 
- the right stats - just enhances 
my understanding of the ga me 
and adds depth and texture when 
r watch a baseball game or evalu-
ate players for a fantasy baseball 
draft. 

For even casual fans, having an 
understanding of some ba ic sta-
tistical principles can help deepen 
their understanding of the game.

Track and field wins invitational 
Starters Navarro, Geach pick up wins,

Coming off a stellar weekend 
March 25 and March 26 where 
the Tritons swept Cal State Los 
Angeles in a three-game series and 
downed Cal State San Bernardino, 
8-3, in a single-game matchup on 
March 29, the UCSD baseball 
team struggled to find its groove 
agai nst Cal State Stanislaus. 

The Tri tons (18-10 overall, 13 -
8 California Collegiate Athletic 
Association) dropped the March 
29 opener, 4-3, in an II-inning 
thriller. UCSD came out strong in 
the first game of the doubleheader 
on April 2 and inched out the 
victory over the Warriors (15 - 17 

overall, 9-9 CCAA), 9-8, but fa l-
tered in the nightcap as Cal State 
Stanislaus shut out the Tritons, 
4-0. In the April 3 series finale, 
the Tritons shelled the Warriors 
in a 16-hit effort for a 14-4 win. 
Details were unavailable at press 
time. 

UCSD split its doubleheader 
with the Warriors on April 2. In 
the nightcap, Cal State Stanislaus 
opened the scoring in the top of 
the second inning when catcher 
Chris LeBouef homered to left-
center field . The Warriors added 
three more runs in the third on two 
walks and two singles to lead and 
ultimately taKe the victory, 4-0.

Men's, women's teams place first among five schools 
By JESSICA NAGER 

Staff Writer 

Track and field dominated this 
weekend as both the men's and 
women's teams won the Point 
Loma Invitational. The Tritons 
placed before host Point Loma 
Nazarene, Cal State University 
San Marcos, Azusa Pacific, 
Vanguard and Concordia . 

For the women, senior Kendra 
Canape won the high jump with 
a mark of 1.68 meters. Her first 
jump established her as the event 
winner, so she was able to set the 
bar at any height for her final 
jump. Although she fell short of 
her attempt at 1.73 meters, a solid 
qualifying mark for Nationals, 
she's glad she tried the jump. 

"I was feeling good yester-
day," Canape said. "I just thought 
I'd try it. " 

Her current best jump of 1.68 
meters is partially the result of 
being able to solely concentrate 
on track and field - in previ-
ous seasons she would have been 
training for volleyball simultane-
ously. 

Freshman Whitney Johnson 
won the triple jump event with a 
mark of 38.2 feet, which is not a 
personal best, but which she said 
"was good enough for this week." 
A relatively new jumper, John on 
has already received NCAA provi-
sional cuts for the event, but she 
says she doesn 't think about the 
conference at the end of the regu-
lar season or NCAA marks before 
each jump. 

"I taKe one jump at a time, 
and 1 just concentrate on my 
technique before each jump," 
Johnson said. "I have three years 

to worry about making a certain 
mark." 

Other first-place fmishers for 
the Triton women included soph-
omore Elisa Holiday, who placed 
first in the long jump with her 
mark of 5.66 meters, and senior 
Katie Hogan, who won the shot 
put event with her throw of 39-
10.5 - half an inch better than 
her best throw from the 2004 
season. 

Canape has no doubt that the 
team's success will continue for 
the rest of the season. 

"Our women's team is the best 
I've ever seen. We have so many 
national qualifiers," Canape said. 
"We have so many seniors taking 
the leadership role, saying this is 
what we need to do. This year at 
conference, we're not expecting 
anything less than winning." 

For the men's team, senior 
Marcus Keller won both the triple 
jump and the long jump events. 
Keller, who has been out for most 
of the season due to a strained 
hamstring, set a personal record 
in the long jump with his jump of 
6.73 meters. 

"I had a lot of nervous energy," 
he said. "I'm nonnally pretty calm 
and mentally ready, so it was nice 
to be able to jump despite that. I 
was just glad to be back and not 
be hurt. " 

He also posted a mark of 13 .89 
meters in the triple jump. 

"I'm looking forward to being 
completely healthy for the rest 
of the season," Keller said. "I'm 
really excited about contributing 
to the team's success." 

In other events, senior Kevin 
Beeman continued his winning 
streak, receiving first place in the 

high jump competition with a 
mark of 2.06 meters. 

Sophomore Kevin Chan and 
junior Mike Kelley both posted 
13.7 meters for the pole vault 
event, but Chan received first 
place because he successfully com-
pleted more jumps overall. Kelley 
said that it's common in pole vault 
for first place to be decided by 
who has fewer missed jumps, cit-
ing similar outcomes in the most 
recent Olympics. 

"It dOesn't happen a lot with 
track events," he said. "But it hap-
pens a lot with field events, espe-
cially with the pole vault." 

Kelley also has high hopes for 
the remainder of the season. 

"Everyone on the team com-
peted really well. We swept 
aU jump events, both men and 
women," Kelley said. "For the 
men's and women's side, we've 
been strong on both the track and 
field teams. We're looking good 
right now. Everyone is strong and 
healthy." 

Track and field wiU next com-
pete April 7 through April 9 at the 
Rafer Johnson Invitational, hosted 

UCLA.
