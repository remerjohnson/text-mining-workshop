"tream of su icide,>, faceless staltstics 
that \\ ere somehow even more 
unstable or more desperate than tho 'e 
unstable people we knew. 

There are a number of reasons for a 
'> tudent to want to attempt suicide. 

~any young people use the attempt as 
a mans of man ipulat illg ot hI's, 
ca lling attention to thems lves, or 
crv ing out for help. 

"Most s tudent who have 
committed suicide have a history of 
depr ssion and l' al emotional distress, 
and often times have mad prior 
all mpts." stated Dr. john Glebink, 
Director of Co uns ling and 

Psychological en' ices at lIC D. 
Giebink feels that pressure from 

s hool may be part of the "t rigger." It 
is. however. an ac 'umu latlOn of 
feelings of de 'pair and hopeI ssness. 
which leads the student to att mpt 
su icide. Suicidal behavior is often 
associated \\ it h an inability to cope 
with vital losses or WIth extreme 
external pressures. Yet noone factor in 
any person's life is in Itself "ulcidai. 
Everyone. at :ome tIme durtng their

There also remains a dIstinct ion

"quant Ity of Itfe" \\"ithtn each per ... on. 
One must determtne the POtnt where 
the qual it} of our 11\ e<., would be so 
pathetically poor that we would no 
longer wish to live. I I sually I hIS fine 
line of distinction exists onlv in our 
su onscious so t hat we are not aware 
of it. but once thIS line IS cms:ed. a 
cn sf. is trigg red . Those who 
maintain hope. cry out for help; those 
who don ' t. are likely to kill themseh'es 
with a quick and final determination .

Bv FRA1'\Z SCH U RMAN 

~ Padfk Nt,,,,,, Ser\'kc 
Ronald Reagan has come out 

un front stage, all alone, to tell 
the nat ion that his program of 
tax cuts and defens spending 
will get the economy moving 
again. 

Hi s a dvi se r s r emain 
backstage, evidently afraid to 
tell their boss that his program 
will only produce huge deficits 
whic h will paralyze the 
economy even further and 
bring on raging inflation . The 
hi sses, eve n fr o m hi s 
admirers, grow louder. 

Yet I he president makes his 
case in good cheer and wit h 
ev ident cUlIfidence that he will 
be ).JrU\'en right. t ' nli ke the 
divisive EI Sa lvador issue un 
which he has let eeret arv of 
State Haig du the bat tling. 
Reagan h as decided to take full 
and '-iole re~ponsibility for the 
economic program. 

If hI:' is wrong, then the roof 
could ca\'e in on the 
Republica n I'art\' in thIS vcar'" 

legi~lati\" l'iectic>n:--. a Illessage 
he IS getting In rising decibeJ... 
from Within hi s own part J. 
Clearly, he is courting an 
enormou" ri"k. 

!-{eagan and his advl"ers -
and just about e\ ery IXldy else 
- know that a sustained drop 
in Intere"t rates \vill spark 
recovery. No downturn will 
mean a '-.Iagnant economy or 
worse 

Wall Street and man\' 
consen'ativcs are telling the 
preSident that interest rates 
can come down if he reduces 
the immenf.e projected budget 
deficit by cutting the defense 
budget and /or re'ic inding the 

tax cuts. Reagan adamantly 
refu ses. He retorts tha t 
recm'ery induced by tax cuts 
will more than pay for a bigger 
defense budget. 

Is the president just a naive 
ex·ac tor. or doe he know 
something that few ot hers do? 

Reagan certain ly knows 
th at hi predecessor, the 
de s pi sed Richard Nixon, 
managed to pu 11 recovery out 
of the swamp of economic 
catastrophe back in the last 
two months of 1970. Does 

I~ o nald Reagan fore see a 
similar feat in ]982? 

This is how it happened 12 
years ago. In mid ·faIl1970, the 
l nited States was s liding 
deeper and deeper into the 
recess ion that Nixon had 
Induced in earl y 1969. Int erest 
rates were at' historic high 
levels. The country st ill was 
stuck fast in Vietnam. An 
ominou<; ann" race featuring 
ABYI sy~tems was heat ing up 
with the. ()\·iets. Dwight 
Ei:-.enhower predicted in hi~ 
retirement that ixon would 
be a one·term pre"ldent 
because of hi ... inabilitv to win 
the fi.ght againf.t inflation. 
Pressure:-. \\ere bui ld ing to do 
something - bring clow n 
interest rates, pump money 
into the economy, in!--olitute 
wage·price cont rols - but 
;-..Iixon held fas t to his "game 
plan." 

Suddenlv, in late November 
Nixon niade a s tartling 
<1nnou ncemen t of his com 'er· 

~i()n to a different t,'conOlllIC 
religion. "I am a Keynesian," 
he declared (about the same as 
Ian Pa isley announcing his 
cumers ion to Roman Catho· 

I ic i. m). Federal Reserve 
Chairman Arthur Burn:... too. 
c hanged his mind and let 
interest rates drop. As money 
poured into the econom y from 
a loosened money policy, it 
s parked re covery. Th e 
recuvery rapid ly gained speed , 
in fact so much so that on 
Augu tIS , ] 971, Nixon had to 
impose wage·price controls. 
The upswing carried through 
] 972 and gave Nixon one of the 
biggest electoral victories in 
US history. 

What happened? Lill ie can 
be lea rned from Nixon 's 
memoir. which invariably 
glide over the most important 
behind·the·scenes dealings of 
his presidency. But looking at 
the foreign affairs realm and 
comparing the situat ion then 
a ncl now uggests an 
explanati on. 

In the latter part of 1970. the 
Nixon administration was 
involved in momentous but 
super·~ecret negotiat ions on 
several key foreign fronts: the 
ta lk s with the North 
Vietnamese to help !--ettle the 
\', ar; talk" \\ ith the. ()\'iets for 
arms control agreements; 
talk'i with t he Communist 
Chinese t o bring ahout 
normalizat ion of relat ions, and 
intricate dealings in I he 
Middle East relating to the 
('mergence of OPEC. 

Failure to reach agreement 
on any or all of t hese front s 
could have led to deadly 
serious conseq uences. Talk 
s urfaced in the fall of 1970 
about in vad ing No rt h 
Vietnam. A full·scale arms

Boring to the beholder Salvadorean elections 
fairness questioned Edi tor: I t is not often that an artist ic 

review sends me das hing off to 
my typewriter, but t his was 
preci se ly the ca e with 
Gregory Barnard's review of 
t he play The Good Hope, 
(Guardian , Mar. 4). 

The wri t er begin s by 
intimat ing that the play is 
boring. Let me hasten to point 
out, h wever, that "boring" is 
in t he mind of t he beholder . 
Most of what we intellectual 

~nobs consider to be great 
literature and art is dismissed 
as "borll1g" by t he vast 
majority of thc population. 
The fact of the malter is that 
the average American v. ould 
rat her watch Dallas on 
television t han a play by 
Shakespeare, the latter lX'ing 
considered "boring." Those 
who belong to this category 
... hould avoid The Good Hope 
like t he plague. 

More irritating to me is the 
assertion that the play, while 

obviolls ly havtng an impact in 
the etherlands of the early 
20th century, ha nothing to 
say to u in this time. Barnard 
men I ions t hat "to t he modern 
audience it was just like so 
many dead fi s h" and that "no 
all mpt was made to 
modernize the value of the 
play ." 

The reviewer has, in effect, 
negated the value of a ll but the 
most recent We 'tern litera· 
ture in one fell swoop. But 
stop, dear reader. Tarry a 
moment before you throw 
away your well worn copies of 
Sophoc les and tendahl , 
transferring from ~evelle's 
human itles sequence to MUir's 

.contemporary i!>sues. 
Th e Good Hope is, in a few 

words, about a fishing boat 
which s inks in a storm , largely 
because the owner of the boat 
was unwilling to replace w hat 
he knew to be an unseawort hy 
vessel. On on level this has 
little to to the modern 

audience. But Ipaving our 
lJarochial Vision b hind us, the 
play has a message whIch 
cou lei scarce l y be more 
relevant toda}. The theme of 
the owner or bus inessman 
who is unwilling to spend the 
money needed to make the 
workers' environment afe for 
them lives on in the mind<-; of 
America; it li\e~ on in an 
administration \vhich I~ 
at I empting to "deregulat e" 

indu~ t ry, making it free to 
devote less capit aJ to the 
health and safety of the 
workplace. 

No. this theme of lI eijer 
mans, like must of those in 
literat ure, is a<-; relevant now 
as it was th n, once one 

tran~cencls the partlcu lars of 
the work of art it<;elf. 
Heijerman' had hope, and his 
hope wli l be I'elevant as lung as 
greed ann corrupt ion endang('r

AynRand 
Editor: 

I would like the opportunity 
to pu blically pay my respect s 
toAyn Rand. the Ru ss ian-born 
nov elis t and philosopher who 
pa sed away last week . 

Ayn Rand wa' a giant on the 
intellect ual cene. a figure 
bot h hated and loved , but 
never to be taken lightly . She 
was distrusted by conserva-
tive ' becau e of her athei m. 
She was hated by liberals 
beca u se of her love of 
capitalism. 

But beyond Rand' , pure 
philosophIcal cO.ntribu t ions 
were her contnbutlOns to 
American literature. Her 
greate ' t novel, At/as hmgged, 
demonstrates imagination and 
plot thought by many to be 
unequalled, anywher . ~ s 
Nathaniel Branden once SaId, 
"A a noveli t, there is no one 
like her. She is the greatest . I 
think t hat future generations 
of literary critic are going to 
look with considerable scorn 
and contempt on the crit ics of 
our age who have failed to 
recognize what s he ha s 
accompli hed." 

'know I speak for more than 
my self when I give her 
memory a s imple , solemn 
'·thank·you."

Budget 'crisis' unifies legislators 
Political foes come together over recent cuts 

By HENRY CHULMAN 
Sucrumc n(o Correspondcn( 

SACRAMENTO - This 
year's budget "crisis" - a 
word becoming th e vogue 
latel y in acramento -
appears to be bringing 
toget her foes in an unprece· 
dented fashion during t h 
Brown admini tration . 

Republica n and Democratic 
leaders. instead of bickering 
wit h eac h ot her. are earnestly 
meeting to find ways to cut 
spending, find more revenue 
and. more s ignificantl y. 
restru ct ure the state's bloated 
welfare and Medi·Cal sys tem s. 

Gov . Brown y terday 

reiterated hi hope that 
legis lators seek a bi-partisan 
solution to alleviate a budget 
short fall now estimated at up 
to $450 million this fi sca l year. 

" My fir st goal i to get thiS 
matter resolved,"thegoyernor 
said yesterda y after meetmg 
with laid off auto workers _ "I 
have met with the (Iegisla-
ture' s) lead er hip several 
time!:>, and there i: really a 
spirit of coope rat ion." 

Brown 's ca lls for unitv are 
not new . The su rprising 
aspect is th e appare nt 
acknowledgem nt by Republi · 
can leaders of Brown 's 
sincertty. 

AS looks at new 
election system 

The ASUC D last night 
considered a new election 
process geared pecifically 
toward u e in a mull i·party 
college y tem uch as 
UCSD ' . 

The process, known as the 
"alternative vote ystem," 
will give a "clear . more 
accurate representat ion" of a 
majority opinion by asking 
student voters to rank each AS 
ca ndidate in order of 
preference, according to Arend 
Liephart, professor of POltical 
Science. who presented the 
new system to t he counci l. By 
eliminating the candidate who 
was lea t prefered, a nd 
transfering votes according to 
ranked preference:. a winning 
candid ate will eventually 
be dete rmin ed , Li eph art-
expl ai ned . 

Both political wings of the 
coun ci l appeared receptive to 
the idea. However. a few 
points of concern were voiced 
by council members. 

Reggie William '. Commis-
sIOner of Student Welfare, told 
the council that it would be 
possible to "stack" an elect ion 
with several associated parties 
and win an election under the 
"alternative vote system." 

'" see no advantage. and 
so me risk." Liephart 
re 'ponded to William 's 
concern over "tacked" 
elections. adding that dividing 
one party into serveral 
associa ted part ies wou Id not 
ne ces a ril y encourage a 
greater amoun t of stud nt 
votes. 

Liephart responded to most 

concerns by stating t hat no 
electoral sys tem i perfect , and 
that the "alternati ve vote 
system " would at least be 
more advantageous than the 
two party system used in pa·t 
AS elections. 

Overall . however. council 
member had positive input 
about the new system. 

Under the "alternati, e" 
system, "the candidate with 
the broade t base will, in the 
end , win the election. which i, 
b nefi clal to the s tudent 
body." Ba em Harb. a Warren 
College represent ative. sa id . 
For example, Harb pointed 
out , if th las t presidential 
election had b en run under 
the "altern at ive svstem". the 
votes received by ihe weakest 
candidat , J ohn Anderson. 
wou Id have been transfered to 
Jimm y Carter, and thu s would 
have allowed a representative 
of the majority liberal class to 
win the election . 

According to Liephart , the 
"alternat ive vote system " has 
been used sucess full y for years 
to elect mem bers of t he lower 
hou se of the Au tralian 
parliam nt, and that it would 
not take a "superhuman" 
effort to e ·tablish the system 
on UCSD. 

Liephart did , howeve r , 
recommend that the A allow 
students to only li s t a 
preference for one ca ndidate if 
the st udent chose to. ot 
listing a prefernce for e\' ry 
ca ndid a t e s h ould n o t 
invalidate a ballot. Liephart 
stressed.

Assem bl} Repu blican leader 
Robe rt Naylor told fellow 
legislat ors Wednesday he has 
been skeptical of ca ll ~ for unity 
si nce Repu blicans were ... 0 
oft en ignored in discussing 
major issues. 

Bu t he accepted the 
cha llenge of working with 
Brown to find >.;o lutions. That 
acceptance" a!:> mamfesled tI1

Naylor and ot hers who 
emerged from ye ... terday·s 
meeting were tight-lipped 
about what specific programs 
will further face the axe thiS 
year. 

, enator John Garameni. C· 
Walnut. a contender [or the 
governorship, agreed the 
meetings were productive. and 
a ll benefactors of :tate money 
a re ubject to further budget 
redurtions. including the 
University of California. 

Brow n agreed yesterday 

that all ideas for reduCIng thl" 
year's budget "arc sttll on the 
table." But after bnefing the 
Assembly Wedn 'sdav on the 

tate's fIscal y\oe"'. he told the 
univerSity not to be too 
concerned' about reductton_ . 

C;aram ndl was more 
tnter(";ted yesterday tn tellmg 
reporter" a-bout his' concept to 
restructure the state's welfarp 
system. a mm, e he said could 
save the state 17 percent per 
year. 

Garamendi said hiS plano.;

the Governor 's budget as 
" reasonable .. . even though it

Speaking to an Assembly

overall level of fu nding be 
mamtained if we are to aVOid 
actions which would ineVI-
ta bly be even more distressing 
than t hose already under-

Saxon not ed that the 
Governor's budget "reduces 
the University', base budget 
(for 1982-83) by $33.5 mtlhon. 
and this on top of a senes of 
major reduct ions since 1978. 

"We have had to take many 
undesirable measures alread\' 
in order to accommodate the 
$33.5 million of reductIOns 
proposed by the Go\'ernor ," 
Saxon pointed out. "Our plans 

include. for exa mple. cuts oj

BY JON TALLARD 
About a year and a half ago. 

Andrew Hougie, a twenty-five-
year-old who e father is a 
hemotologi st at Scripps 
Medical Center, was watching' 
Robert Wagner execute a stunt 
in a rerun of It Takes a Thief 
In this part icular episode. 
some jewel thieves were 
e. caping from a museum in 
their car when Wagner leaped 
up onto the roof of the car, 
holding on by grabbing with 
one hand the Iittlegrill in front 
of the wind s hield wiper and. 
with the other, the side 
mirror. Wagner then reached 
In t he side w indow and 
wrestled the steeri ng wheel 
out of the driver' control. 
ca using the vehicle to crash. 

" It "tuck in my mind ." 
Hougie recalls abou t the stunt. 
"ft seemed very amazing fur a 
person to go to that extreme to 
catch someone. It wasn't an 
everyday thing." And he 
remembers thinking to 
himself, ' 'I'd love to have the 
oppor tunit y to try thi s 
someday." 

His memories were trigge-
red violently about 9:00 p.m 
on theeveningofDecember 16. 

Hougie had been hired for 
the Christmas sea. on as a box 

bo~' by the Sports Aren<1 
FedMart. and was gathering 
shopping carts 111 the parking 
lot. Ht' recall s noticing three 
boy,;, ablJ ut thirteen or 
fourt cen ~ cars old, approach 
two young worn n near t hL' 
f ronl of t he store - 19·\'ear-old 
Kathryn Shaw, and her s ister. 
2J-yea-r-old ,hene Long. I Ie 

~aw one of the youths walk 
between the two women and 
bump Sha\\ whIle another 
grabbed her purse and bolted . 
The victim began screaming; 
Hllugie say he heard a 
bystander laugh viclOu Iy at 
the \ictim , 

He say that laugh 
ga lvanized him. He yelled to 
his fellow workers to help him 
out , and he and several

youths with the purse to the 
Midway Drive side of the 
tore, where th third 

accomplice was waiting with a 
s tolen 1972 Pinto. Seventeen-
y ar -old Tammi Rene 

tanzione grabbed one of the 
youths by the arm and tried to 
turn off the ignition while 
Tracie Ann Turner, 19, got the 
li ce n se plate numb er . 
Meanwhile, Hougie stationed 
himself in front of the \'ehid , 
leaning forward. w ith hi " 
arms and legs braced anll 
spread wide. Turner yelled 
t hat she had t he license 
number and evervone but 
Hougi e ran to avoid the 
starting automobile. Jus t pnor 
to t he car' s sudden takeo ff. 
Hougie sprang into aClion , 
leaping onto the hood of the 
car. 

") jumped right onto the 
hood," he says, "exactly th 
way Robert Wagner did It. 
With tho e things. you cannot 
afford to make a mistake," he 
say solemnly. 

As th car began to sp ed 
north on Midway Drive with 
Hougie desperately clinging to 
the dri ver's mirror wi t h on 
hand and the windshield grill 
with the other, he reca ll ~ that 
he was disappomted 10 fmd 
I hat In t hi in<;tanre the 
wind{l\\ 10 t he car was t Ighlly 
'ihut, barring hIS access to the 
steering wheel. "At that point 
) kne\\ I would hil\'e to act mv 
own unrehearsed scnpt ." . 

He began yelling for the 
driver to let hIm off. They 
responded by alternately 
swerving, braking, an d 
quickly accelerating. Hougle 
decided t hat if he cou Idn 't 

control the car himself, th 
best thing he cou ld do was 
attempt to block th driver's 
vision, as he moved hIS body in 
front of the windshield. 

1eanwhile, Donald Ptacek, 
a 48-year-old San DIego tate 
Univer51ty employee . was 
driving a Ford pIck-up truck 
along Midway in the same 
direct ion a~ t he getaway car, 
and noticed 19' \ear -o ld

al 0 insislS that, , hould the 
criminal. be caught. he would 
not press charges on his own 
behalf. "I ha 'e not hing again';t 
those guys. I'm just glad they 
didn't kill me." 

He admits to being 
somewhat miffed that he 
didn't received more formal 
recognition for effort in 
apprehending the mugger. "I 
did get a 'Iight commendation 
(from Chief Kolender)," he 
. ays, " but I wish he'd given me 
more." Also, he regrets that 
the FedMart CorporatIOn 
declined to make any formal 
comment on t he mat ter. 

In the months si nce the 
incident occurred, Hougie has 
been act ively trying to get 
more upport for his action by 
going to newspap rs, pUblicity 
agents, and encouraging 
people to write in to the 
television shows, ThaI's 
Incredible and Real People. He 
insi ts he never thought of 
receiving money or glory when 
he made hi ' leap. ") did whal I 
did fur personal ~al i>.faction," 
he says. "I really don't want 
glory. ) mainly want it 
recognized thaI I did whal I 

Open a U.S.E. 

did . The mall1 reason I'm doing 
all this is I think it's (the 
incident) a major break · 
through in my character. A lot 
of peopl think I'm a self· 
cent ered person and I car 
about only myself. That's the 
reason I haven 't had many 
friends in this world. No one 
wants to be friends with a 
brat. The thing is, I'm not a 
self·centered brat anymore; I 
do care about other people 
more I han I do my~elf . ow I 
can say, 'Hey, did you hear 
about what happened at 
FedMart?' 

"I I hink t he media is the best 
way to let people know about

that his example might inspire 
others to help th ir fellow 
man. " 1 wish more people 
would care," he complains. 
"{' d like to see ot her people 
care more. There's too many 
pl'Ople in this world who don't 
care."

Cancer figures for 1982 predicted 
In 1982 about 835,000 people 

will be diagnosed as having 
cancer. 

Cancer is a large group of 
diseases characterized by 
uncont roll ed growth and 
spread of abnormal cells. I f the 
spread is not controlled or 
checked, it results in death. 
However, many cancers can be 
cured if detected and treated 
by surgery, X·rays, radioactive 
ubsta n ces, chemicals, 

hormones or immunotherapy. 
This century has seen much 

progress in the battle with 
cancer. In the early 1900's few 
cancer patient had any hope 
of long· term survival. In the 
1930' less t han one in five was 
alive at least five years after 
treatment. In the 1940' it was 
one in four . Now the ratio is 
one in three. Thegain from one 
in four to one in three 
currently represent s about 
70,000 people this year. 

Cancer trikes at any age. It 
kills more children 3 to 14 than 
any other disease. And cancer 
strikes more frequently with 
advancing age. 

About ,58 million Americans 

now living will eventually 
have cancer; one in four , 
according to present rates. 
Over the years, cancer will 
strike in approximately two of 
three families. In the 70's there 

and ha the same life 
expectancy as a person who 
never had cancer. 

The decision as to when a 
patient may be con, idered 
cured is one that must be made 

However, some patients can 
be considered cured after one 
year, others after three years, 
whereas some have to be 
followed much longer. 

One in four Americans 
will one day have cancer 

About 278,000 Americns, or 
about one-third of all people 
who get cancer this year, will 
be alive at least five years after 
treatment. However. when 
normal life expectanq is 
taken into considerat ion 
(factors such as dying of heart 
di ea e, acciden t~ and diseases 
of old age), 41 percent of cancer 
patients will urvive at least 
five years. 

Some cancers can be 
prevented. Most iung cancers 
are caused by cigarette 
s moking, and most kin 
cancers by frequent overexpo· 
sure to direct su nlight. The, e 
cancers can be prevented by 
avoiding their causes. Certam 
cancers caused by occupa-
lional / em'lronrnental factors 
can he prevented b~ 
eliminating or reducing 
contact with carcinogenic 
agents. Examples include 
bladder cancer among workers 
in the dye Industry and lung 
ca ncer in asbestos workers, 
espeCially t ho'>e who are also 

~moker<, 
were an e timated 3.5 million 
cancer deaths, over 6.5 million 
new cancer cases, and more 
than 10 million people under 
medical care for cancer. 

There are over 3 million 
Americans alive today who 
have a hi tory of cancer, 2 
million of them with diagnosis 
fi\'e or more years ago. Most of 
these 2 million ca n he 
considered cured, while others 
, till have evidence of cancer. 
By "cured" it i meant t hat a 
pat ient remain free of disease 

by th e phy s ician after 
examining the individual 
patient. For most forms of 
cancer, five years without 
symptoms following treat-
men t is t he accepted time. 

Taking the national death 
rate into account, age-adjusted 
ca ncer death rate ' for major 
ites, except t he lungs, are m 

general leveling off and in 
some cases declining.

Last un day t he NCAA announced 
select ions for berths in their 4 ·team coll egiate 
ba ketball rodeo, ot herwise known a. the 
NCM Tourna ment, But NCAA basketball 
director Dave Gavi tt qualified the selections 
first. "We feel we came as close a we e\er 
have, to gett ing the best 48 teams in the 
cou ntry," hesaid . T ranslatIOn: "Hey fellas, we 
did a lou 'y job of selecti ng tea ms, but one of 
these years we'll get It nght." 

Although it's not exactly tne CAA, Gavitt 
and his board of basketball overseers might do 
well to run a study of the UC D 1M

WAMP, I~C . of the Bobb} jones ingle-A 
League fim~hed the year 4·3, 5th place and out 
of the play-offs It was lhe fiN above ,500 team 
in recent 1M history to not rna ke it to the

more importantly ... the.e guys knuw how lO

then again, the third time I~ not nece san ly the

2) WHITE P NK (8·0) ... Anv team with jeff 
Marks. Bert Hansen, and Martin Collette will 
be tough to deal ..... Ith. If only because of the 
experience factor. No one at l 'C D has logged

Back to the recr uiting wa rs for you. 

T he reason for getti ng the best teams in the 
play-offs is sim ple. 1M play·off berths are 
awarded on a purely object ive basis ... the top 
four teams in each league are advanced to the 
champiom,hip round, It doesn't sou nd too 
complicated, but somehow the NCAA likes to 
persecute its members with subjectivity. Oh 
well, they've only been at this thing fo r 45 
years or so. Like we said ... one of these years 
they'll get II nght. 

And although the NCAA Tournament does 
ma nage to get a few Jl(.'Ople around the country 
fired up, they aren't that much ahead of good

film that at least attempt s to 
add res current i sue . It is 
unfortunate, becau se Th e 
Border does not leave the 
viewer feeling t hat he has 
gained much of anything. It is 
also unfortunate that the 
screenwriters are forced to 
resort to the typical boy meets 
girl, boy loses girl. plot in 
presenting thi view of life 
along the border. 

Perhaps this film 's attempt 
to appear as a modern love 
story in an intere t ing 10 ale 
does the mo t damage to any 
crit ica l success that thi film 
might have engendered. In 
being hown a rather subdued 
Jack icholson enrapt ured 
with a Mexicana attempti ng to 
immigrat e into the l S. the 
viewer has a difficult time 
d termining what thle.; fi lm is 
trying to ay. 

Jack Nicholson and Elpidia Carillo star in 'The Border' a new film about the way oflire along the Mexican-American border. 

The viewer find. in the 
fIlm's end, that Nicholson has 
not solved the corrupt ion of 
the Border Pat rol. in fact he 
has been bribed as well. The 
vi wer also finds t hat nothing 
has been done to rectify the 
plight of illegals. 

'The Border' is unfair tale of alien life Nicholson, aside from falling in love with one 
Mexican girl, has not found a 
great love for these impover' 
ished Mixicans either. Really. 
can you ever \\ alk out of a film 
fee ling good alxlut having four 
dollars stnpped from YOU if the 
leading charart er says in his 
bc!>tJohn Wa~ne dra\d at the 
film's end, "A guy's just gotta 
feel good about .;omet hing." 
His audience, a lone Mexican 
girl, could not unden;tand a 
word he said. As a viewer I 
didn't understand either: but 
after watching this complete 
disregard for depictll1g reality 
I C'OU Id care less. 

continu d from page 13 
unemployment in Mexico, i~ 
r sponsible for t he mas"

only dealt a depiction of life m 
"no man's land" between the 
U and MeXICO, a depict ion 
that falls short of an\ 
meanmgfu I or lastmg impact-_ 

The character: in th film 
are about a. one-dimen 'ilmal 

as the f!lm's portrayal of 
border life. The mirrored 
su nglasses of the border 
patrolmen barel~ conceal their 
disillusionment, \\ hich has led 
to self-serving corruption.

The'Mexican \\omen are

prostitutes. an unimaginat i\ e 
categorization that fails to 
provide the viewer with 

understanding or insight. And

grant'; themselvec; are

"coyotes," their paid guides.

t hest' quest Ions and II1stead 
cho()<,es to simply show 
MeXicans a. a people With no 
past, no future and a 
dangerous present, over which 
they have litt Ie con tro!. 

If this film has done a 

-University Bookstore 

disservice to anyone, it is to 
the film industrv it~elf. The 
Peckinpahish vioience e\ idem 
IS an indication that this fi lm 
I" nothing more than the 
explOitatIOn of an already 
volati le subject. The abuse of 
the Mexican laborer is worthy 
of a more conci!-.e port ray al. 
The film is an admission that 
many st ill feel t hat American

films that deal with current 
and substantive problems.

Reprise Record 5. 

BY MIKE THOMA 
There are I/O waves. There is 
only the ocean. 

-Claude Chabrol 
Imagine you were living 

during the decline of the 
Roman Empire. Now imagine 
you're an artist and you (being 
the antenna of the race and all ) 
know what" goi ng on. What 
are the choices? Become l. 
Augustine and write The City 
of God or do your job in the face 
of that bad moon rising. Bob 
Dylan chose t he former and 
Neil Young has taken the 
latter course in hi latest 
album, ReAcI-Or and proven 
himself the most consisten t 
and durable rocker of all. 

After a decade and a half, 
Young is till rocking away. 
And in his long-t ime backup 
band, Crazy Horse, he's found 
one of the finest rhythm 
sect ion around. In the 
locomot ion churglings of 
"SOUl hern Pacific," t he heavy-
metal Detroit polka of "Motor 
City" and the explosive 
"Shots" Crazv Horse sou nd 
as vibrant an-d tough a any 
new wave band. 

And wave ' are very much on

tate of the Union LP and a 

post-WW [[[ holocaust novel 
and movie) contemplating the

wisdom asked for in the 
Serenity Prayer (printed in 
Latin on the LP back jacket) 
You ng wears a com ic fat al ism, 
an almost spiritu al di spas-
sionate detachment in the face 
of any apocalyp e later . 

Like his previou LP, Hawks 
& Dm'es. Young confronts the 
problems of ou r age with an 
almo. t idiot ic glee. There are a 
stra nge group of motley 
characters inhabiting the 

records 
grooves of the disc, losers and 
low-lifes like urfer Joe & Moe 
the ' Ieaze, the singer who 
lose. his girlfriend to a 
highbrow at the opera, the 
railroad man who loses his job 
and Young him elf who 
wonders why there are so 
many Japanese cars while 
Motor City is going under and 
then can't get his own car 
started . 

But the weirdest - and 
funnie t - line are in t he 
funky "Rapid Transi t, " where 
he stutters out "Mmmmm-
meltdow n," "Ccccccontain-
men t ," " Ppppppropaganda" 
and a whole litany of daily 
terrors. Only in "Shots," the 

final cut, does the implicit 
ten ion erupt and t hen it is 
truly terrifying. With the 
s hriek of Young's guitar 
rivaling the best of Jimi 
Hendrix, this performance 
r lea es the fear that the r st 
of the album tries to deny or 
laugh at. 

But mostly thi~ is Neil 
Young's comedy album and 
the key may well be '·T·Bone." 
' tretched out o\'er a nine-

minute-long handclapping 
blue riff. the song is a kind of

4-0 Lacrosse club to 
face Brigham Young 

BY COTT YOUNG 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD Lacrosse Club 
picked up two more close 
games in the last couple of 
weekends to round off the first 
half of their eason, with a 
solid 4-0 record. 

Founded this year by 
freshmen Dave Hammond and 
Scott Hill, the Lacros 'e Club 
holds an unrivalled first place 
in league tandings, having 
scored victories over all of the 
other league teams. 

The club faced Cal Poly San 
Luis Obi po Saturday, Feb. 27, 
in a game attended by "about 
200 people," Hammond said . 
Fortunately, the crowd got to 
see a win, as UCSD narrowly 
beat Cal Poly 6-5 in triple 
overti me, 

The following Sat urday, the 
team travelled to Whittier, 

where, according to Ham-
mond, they had "a very rough 
game ... it was pretty inten e." 
Wit h a final score of 8-6, the 
game was marked by two 
bench-clearing brawls, in 
which member. of Whittier' 
football team joined the fight, 
threatening UCSD players 
with beer bottle. " It was not a 
cool scene at all," Hammond 
. aid, adding "people were 
diving headfir t into the 
pile ... we got out of there right 
after t he game." 

This Saturday, in what 
Hammond described as "a big 
game," UCSD will face non-
league Brigham Young 
Univer. ity. The game will be 
held at Third College Field at 
1 :00. A usual, "refresh· 
ments" will be available after 
the game. 

usually is," analyze Yate" 
"and Yokomoto wa ju t 
rattled ," a t leas t enough to 
comm it three of his team's 
four error during his short 
tand . 
Lately, inconsistency is the 

team's most prevalent 
con i tency. "It .eems like 
when the pitching is sharp, we 
can't get the offen e going. 
And when the offen 'e get~ 
going, we lose the pitching. 
Again t Cal Tech though ," 
continues the coach, "we had 
both." 

With the Sun-Lite Cla~sic 
beginning next aturday. 
they'll need both. nfortu· 
nately, Finals Week is causing 
the coach to eliminate a few 
practices. The players even 
voted unanimou ly to cancel a 
game again t La Verne, 
originally scheduled to follow 
the Cal Tech mas acre. ''I'm 
all for academics," states an 
understanding Yates. Under 
these conditions, it's no easy 
task, but he's still working 
desperately to put things 
together.

Speed kill s, and good 
pitching beat good hitting 
every time. These are just t\\'o 
reasons why the Houston 
A~tros will capture the 
National League West. The 
Astros, lik the great 
Cincinnat i elu bs of the 70's. 
are built for astroturf and 
especially the Astrodome. On a 
s lick artificial turf, speed is 
everyt hing, and in th lifeless 
Hou s ton dome power is 
uscles. and pitching becom s 
the quintessential el ment. 
The Astros might win only 
win half their road games, but 
they will easily win 50-55 at 
home and that will be enough 
for the Western title. 

The Los Angeles Dodgers 
will never go higher than

Houston has perhaps the 

best pitching s taff ever 
assembled . If 1.R Richard can 
come hack this year. the 
Astros will break every 
strikeout and shutout record 
in the book. The offen 'e isn't 
spectacular. but Manager Bill 
Virdon produces magic with 
hi s players on the ba epat hs. 
This club won't need many 
runs, though. They 'regoing to 
the playoffs solely on the ba. is 
of their pitching. 

Predicting the Dodgers to 
finish runner-up is a gift -
Fernando or no Fernando. L.A. 
has the mo t overrated infield 
in the league with the 
exception of (and I hate to 
admit it ) teve Garvey. Bill 
Russell is lucky to knock down 
a ground ba ll , and ROil Ccy not
