The placement of a bridge over 
Interstate 5 has set residents against 
a La Jolla area Mormon church in a 
debate over the future of the Mid-
Coast Transit Project — which is 
slated to connect Downtown San 
Diego to the La Jolla community and 
the UCSD campus via extensions to 
the Blue Line Trolley by 2018.

Progress has stalled as disagree-
ment between Cape La Jolla Garden 
residents and members of the La 
Jolla Temple of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-Day Saints has arisen 
over which streets adjacent to I-5 will 
connect to a bridge planned as part of 

the project. The debate over whether 
the bridge will be constructed farther 
north or south, however, will not 
affect where future trolley stations 
will be located on UCSD.

According to the San Diego 
Association of Government, a trolley 
bridge across the I-5 is necessary for 
the Mid-Coast Transit Project, antici-
pated to begin construction in 2015, 
to create stations at La Jolla Village 
Square, around the UCSD campus 
and the Westfield University Town 
Center mall.

An April 17 NBC 7 San Diego 
article stated that the Cape La Jolla 
Garden residents and leaders of the 
La Jolla Temple both believe they 
will be most affected by the con-
struction process.

SANDAG Director of Mobility 
Jim Linthicum oversees the Mid-
Coast Transit Project — which first 
came to fruition in 2013 — and 
hopes to get as much input from 
community members as possible 
before making the final decision. A 
presentation of the project will be 
held on May 9, and will be open to 
the public for feedback.

“The Cape La Jolla folks believe 
the trolley should go a little bit further 
north than where it was shown in our 
environmental document,” Linthicum 
said. “The temple folks think it should 
go a little further south and we are try-
ing to work through that now.”

SANDAG expects to make the 
final decision on the placement of 
the bridge this summer. The County 

of San Diego will approve the final 
location in a majority vote at a later 
date, according to NBC 7 San Diego.

UCSD Vice Chancellor for 
Resource Management and 
Planning Gary Matthews supervises 
three to four major transportation 
Light Rail Projects, which are part of 
the Mid-Coast Transit Project.

“I don’t think it will impact [UCSD] 
at all [and] we are not affected by that 
discussion,” Matthews said. 

There will be two stations on the 
school campus. One will be close to 
Pepper Canyon in Sixth College and 
another stop will be in the east campus 
near Preuss school on the opposite side 
of the I-5.

UC  SYSTEM SCIENCE  AND  TECHNOLOGY

A research consortium from 
UCSD and the City of University 
of New York Graduate Center was 
one of six teams to gain access to 
Twitter’s public and historical data-
base for individual research pur-
poses.

Last February, Twitter 
announced the other winning teams 
for its first #DataGrant program, 
including research groups from 
other countries such as Japan, the 
United Kingdom, Australia and the 
Netherlands. The only other U.S.-
based team is from Harvard Medical 
School and the Boston Children’s 
Hospital.

The four-member UCSD and 
CUNY team of researchers is com-
prised of two UCSD alumni: data 
scientist Mehrdad Yazdani (Ph.D., 
2012), who works for the Software 
Studies Initiative at Qualcomm 
Institute, and 2012 alumnus from 
the Interdisciplinary Computing 
and the Arts program Jay Chow. 
The other two research members are 
CUNY Graduate Center professor 
of computer science Lev Manovich 
and University of Pittsburgh his-
tory of art and architecture Ph.D. 
candidate Nadav Hochman, who is 
currently working under Manovich 
as a visiting scholar.

For their latest Twitter research 
project, the researchers will use 
open source tools, such as OpenCV 

UCSD and CUNY 
researchers will analyze 
tweeted images to 
measure happiness.

Mid-Coast Transit Project Sparks Debate in La Jolla
La Jolla community members disagree on the location of a crossbridge, but stops at UCSD will not be affected

Associate NEws Editor

See TRANSIT, page 3

UCSD admitted a record low 33.4 percent of freshmen applicants for Fall Quarter 2014, according to University of California Office 
of the President data released on Friday, April 18. 
Additionally, more traditionally underrepresented 
students are being admitted as a bigger percentage of 
the total number of admitted students.

The data indicates that an increasing number of 
students are applying to UCSD while the university 
has begun admitting a fewer number of students. The 
university admitted a total of 24,528 out of 73,454 

applicants and expects approximately 4,900 of them 
to attend as freshmen in Fall Quarter 2014. 

The University of California as a whole admitted 
58.4 percent of applicants, down 0.8 percent from last 
year. The only two UC campuses with lower admis-
sions rates than UCSD were UC Berkeley and UCLA, 
which admitted 17 and 18 percent of applicants, 
respectively.

UCSD notably increased its admittances of under-
represented groups by 4.1 percent, largely due to

and Python, and software they 
have developed themselves, called 
ImageMontage, to analyze selfies 
for features such as orientation and 
color measures.

The researchers have already 
concluded two similar previous 
projects known as Phototrails and 
Selfiecity, with datasets available 
online for public viewing. 

Over 2.3 million Instagram self-
ies from 13 different cities were 
analyzed for the team’s Phototrails 
project in 2013. In addition, 3,200 
Instagram selfies from over six dif-
ferent metropolitan areas were eval-
uated for Selfiecity in early 2014. 

The researchers will be imple-
menting the same method they used 
in their recent Selfiecity project to 
evaluate the Twitter selfies by look-
ing for low to high level features.

“Low-level features, such as the 
brightness and saturation levels of 
images, provide us with an idea of 
the environment they were taken 
in,” Yazdani said. “While high-level 
features involve aspects like the per-

son’s gender and the presence or 
absence of a smile.”

The visualization tools available 
at Calit2 will also be used to effec-
tively evaluate the expansive data-
base of selfies on larger displays.

Previously, research to measure 
happiness has largely focused on 
text shared on social media. The 
team hopes to extend the study to 
include images such as those shared 
on Twitter.

“There is so much value in data 
that we have not yet discovered how 
to learn all we can from,” Yazdani 
said. “This is why Twitter has 
reached out to the research com-
munity to see what people can come 
up with. I suspect that as we delve 
more and more into the project, 
new questions will pop up, and our 
data will provide statistically sound 
answers.”

Twitter views the creation of its 
#DataGrant program as a public ser-
vice, as well as a method to promote 
the breadth of its database, which 
boasts an average of 5,700 tweets 
per second based on data provided 
by Twitter on August 2013. 

The other winning teams will 
pursue research projects of their 
own, such as Japan’s converting 
Twitter data into a disaster infor-
mational analysis system and the 
United Kingdom analyzing how 
tweets play a role in the perfor-
mance of sports teams.

Since Twitter’s announcement, 
Harvard Medical School and Boston 
Children’s Hospital have reached 
out to Yazdani’s group with the 
intention of starting a separate proj-
ect involving the dataset from the 
Selfiecity project. 

Manovich viewed the collabora-
tion in a positive light for both par-
ties to advance their research.

“The selfies and underlying data 
would be part of a global public 
health study,” Manovich said in an 
April 21 UCSD News Center online 
article. “We are delighted to start 
working with them because they 
are leaders in using social media for 
public health research.”

New Cell Phone Charging 
Stations Will Begin Trial Period

As I hastily walked into the A.S. 
meeting, a representative from the 
Vice Chancellor’s Diversity Equity 
and Inclusion Office  was present to 
answer any questions that the Council 
had, along with listening to certain 
changes the council members wanted 
to see on campus.

Physical Sciences Senator Sierra 
Donaldson 
explained how 
there should be 
more extensive 
training for both 
students and 
faculty on assaults.

“I know that the Sexual Awareness 
Resource Center is doing bystander 
intervention training, but I wonder 
if that could be instituted for student 
staff or faculty as more of an extensive 
sexual assault training,” Donaldson 
said. “Not only from refraining 
from using triggering words, but 
understanding where the lines are 
drawn and what’s okay to do and 
what’s not okay to do.”

VP Finance and Resources Sean 
O’Neal also explained some potential 
solutions for tradition events and 
fund reserves for the next Council.

“A big question was how do we 
replenish our reserves,” O’Neal said. 
“I think the number that we got was 
5 percent out of the expendable funds 
— the funds after the referendum was 
allocated. So that would be a source of 
replenishment.”

AVP Enterprise Operations Irene 
Chang talked about a new machine 
on campus that will allow students 
to charge their cell phones on-site. 
The machine will be placed within a 
locker and the charge will be $2.55 
per hour. 

Students will be able to pay via 
credit card and once they have paid, 
the locker will pop open and allow the 
student to charge his or her phone. 

The machine is on a trial period and 
A.S. Council will receive a cut of the 
money, providing $9,000 of revenue 
for the council.

In response to a proposed 
amendment that would immediately 
remove a member who has accrued 
more than six unexcused absences 
or 30 excused absences during their 

term, Chang 
explained that her 
presence is not 
needed during the 
meetings due to her 
position in office.

“The main reason I see for this 
legislation is so everyone is aware of 
what is going on and to make people 
more accountable,” Chang said. “I can 
go to cabinet [meetings] and just sit 
there and contribute nothing ... It will 
not solve the issue at hand.”

AVP Academic Affairs Robby 
Boparai commented on why he 
believes there should be a certain 
amount of meetings the council 
members should be required to attend.

“I think it’s very important that 
council is aware of what is going on 
in the offices and that’s why I think 
it’s important that they come to 
cabinet,” Boparai said.

The item was tabled for one week 
so there could be an open dialogue 
between AVP’s on this issue. 

An amendment to remove 
the candidate statements, slate 
affiliations and candidate pictures 
from the main page of the A.S. 
website during election voting, as 
well as a move to create a hyperlink 
to view these items failed with a vote 
of 0-22-1.

Two more votes occurred on this 
subject, with a final vote of 19-0-
4, requiring a hyperlink for the 
candidate’s pictures and statements; 
however, the slate affiliations shall 
remain on the main page.

Construction for Light Rail Trolley Projects Will Begin in 2015

Average High School GPA and SAT Scores Increased from 2013

an 8.1-percent increase in admit-
ted Latino applicants, totaling 20.4 
percent of all admitted students. 
Meanwhile, African-Americans rep-
resented only 2.3 percent of admit-
ted students, a decrease from last 
year in which they represented 2.5 
percent. Additionally, the figure of 
admitted students from families of 
low incomes increased by 2.7 percent, 
the number who will be first-genera-

tion college students increased by 9.3 
percent and the number of students 
from fourth and fifth quintile (lower 
ranking) high schools increased by 
15.1 percent.

The average high school grade 
point average of UCSD admitted stu-
dents was 4.13, an increase of 0.2 
from last year. UCSD’s average SAT 
score increased to 2018 from last 
year’s score of 1993. Comparatively, 
the average SAT score of students 
admitted to UC Berkeley was 2071.

“We are proud to welcome this 
bright and dynamic group of stu-
dents to UC San Diego,” Chancellor 
Pradeep K. Khosla said in a press 
release. “As a student-centered public 
university, it is our goal to provide 
opportunities and a world-class edu-
cation to these amazingly accom-
plished and talented students from 
diverse backgrounds.”

According to Matthews, there will 
be another stop near the Veterans 
Hospital, which is not near campus, 
but aims to draw people to the univer-
sity for cultural events.

Meanwhile, other light rail projects 
will also be implemented on campus, 
such as the Gilman bridge and the 
I-5 direct access ramp Voigt Bridge 
connecting to UCSD. These projects 
are funded by Federal Transportation 
funds and Local Trans Net tax funds.

“All projects listed are to be fund-
ed by others and not the University,” 
Matthews said. “Our role has and 
will be to insure that the projects 
are coordinated and phased to sup-
port the University, students, faculty 
and staff.”

The Gilman bridge is a part of 
the Light Rail Trolley Project and 
will be placed near the Veterans 
Administration Medical Center 
connecting to Sixth College. It will 
facilitate both pedestrian and vehi-
cle crossing to UCSD.

Additionally, a direct access 
ramp will connect the I-5 freeway 
exit directly to UCSD.

There will be a briefing in July 
to the UCSD Regents on the Mid-
Coast Transit Projects including 
the Gilman bridge, direct access 
ramp and other light rail projects. 
Construction on all projects is 
expected to begin in the next few 
years.

Angela McMahill has been 
appointed the new Conflict of Interest 
Director in the UCSD Office of 
Research Affairs, effective April 21.

According to the COI Office’s 
website, its role is to assess situations 
where personal circumstances could 
“compromise the actions or judg-
ments in administration, management, 

teaching, research or performance of 
any professional activities at UC San 
Diego.” The office mostly serves cam-
pus faculty and postdoctoral trainees.

McMahill, who holds a 
Juris Doctor degree, previous-
ly served as the director of the 
Research Compliance Program in 
UCSD’s Health Sciences division. 
Additionally, McMahill has served as 
the San Diego Chapter President of 
the Association of Clinical Research 

Professionals. She will be replacing 
Interim Director Jennifer Oh. 

“Ms. McMahill is extraordinarily 
well qualified to direct our Conflict 
of Interest office,” Vice Chancellor for 
Research Sandra Brown said in an 
April 8 campuswide letter. “We ask 
that you help  welcome her to this key 
campus position.”

Saving Sun God

Sun God Festival coordinators have offered several solutions to ensure a safer 
event, but change is impossible without student compliance.

Nostalgia 
Trips Aren’t 
All Happy- 
Go-Lucky

hilary  lee hhl009@ucsd.eduRhyme  or  reason

Last weekend, I trekked over to Balboa Park with a few old friends to recreate pictures 
and memories of a day trip we had 
taken together freshman year. We 
had lost touch numerous quarters 
ago and sought to bask in nostalgia 
for old times’ sake.

To say a lot had changed over the 
past four years would be an under-
statement. One friend came out to 
his parents and suffered through a 
major depressive episode; another 
gained self-esteem by losing over 50 
pounds and discovering love in a boy 
with a cheeky grin. The wild child 
managed to escape a debilitating 
lifestyle of unrestrained hedonism, 
while the Scrappy-Doo of the group 
overcame her “keeping up with the 
Joneses” attitude to develop her own 
individuality. Majors changed; career 
paths changed more.

On the surface, we very much 
appeared to epitomize the jolly 
togetherness of the Traveling Pants 
folks, giggling like tickled middle 
schoolers and striking poses to 
match those we had taken years ago 
with my now embarrassingly low-
megapixel camera.

However, the differences between 
us were palpable and difficult to 
ignore. One friend had what could 
best be described as an existential 
crisis during our sophomore year, 
withdrawing from all social contact 
and later emerging with a radically 
altered personality. It was impossible 
for some of us to see eye-to-eye with 
each other on anything, even deci-
sions as insignificant as which vendor 
to stop at for lunch. Physically, we 
were different as well. That 18-year-
old enthusiasm that had previously 
allowed us to endure a three-hour 
adventure in taking buses, hopping 
on trolleys and crossing freeways 
simply to make it downtown had 
long ago dissipated and had been 
replaced by First World complaints of 
how long the car ride was. 

So much had transpired in the 
intervening time between our previ-
ous trip and now it was futile to even 
attempt to catch up to speed with 
each other; instead, we collectively 
succumbed to a quiet resignation 
that we were each now fundamen-
tally dissimilar people. An antici-
pated full day event was shortened to 
only a few hours because we were all 
too jaded to continue the facade of 
enjoying each other’s presence.

The notion of time being slip-
pery became very real to me at 
that moment. The interval between 
freshman orientation and gradua-
tion seemed to have passed quicker 
than a Vine, but it made a world of 
difference because none of us were 
even close to being the same people 
we were four years ago. The contrast 
between each of our current circles 
of friends reflects this divergence of 
interests, as people tend to phase out 
those with whom they have few com-
monalities with.

When friends become removed 
from each other and mature sepa-
rately, differences are bound to sur-
face and strain relationships. Even 
after acknowledging this, I was 
still taken aback at these intangible 
deaths that had crept up so silently. 
I miss what we had at one time and 
what — despite our newly acquired 
wealth of cheesy photos — we’ll 
never quite have again.

ILLUSTRATION BY ELYSE YANG

Since guest tickets for the Sun God Festival were eliminated, the fate of the event has hinged tentatively on the 
ability of A.S. Concerts and Events to main-
tain its sustainability and safety. Because of 
last year’s high number of alcohol-related 
detainments, there were concerns that 
Sun God Festival 2014 wouldn’t happen. 
Although the status of 2015 festival is still 
somewhat tenuous, ASCE’s Sun God Task 
Force has delivered an intelligent and hope-
fully viable remedy. 

While it’s not quite the radio-frequency 
identification chip we were hoping for, we 
believe the new, online wristband distribu-
tion and registration system could be a 
long-term solution to the safety issues that 
have plagued Sun God Festival in the past. 
However, imposed changes cannot possibly 
be a success without cooperation from the 

students. Students must take the initiative 
to not only inform themselves about the 
sweeping changes, but also to adhere to 
them if they wish to keep Sun God Festival 
alive in the years to come. 

ASCE has already made creditable efforts 
to publicize the new regulations — they 
have posted on Facebook, reached out to 
student orgs, published the new policies 
on its website and even received significant 
coverage from the UCSD Guardian. Now, it 
is up to us as students to take these changes 
seriously. After all, we are the ones that will 
be affected by all the negative ramifications 
if safety continues to be an issue. 

Hopefully, the wristband barcode accom-
plishes what it was designed to do, which is 
to ensure student safety. In case of emergen-
cies or detainments, authorities will be able 
to instantly identify students and access 

relevant information (name, phone num-
ber, local address and emergency contact) 
provided online during registration. With 
that said, we as students should aim to avoid 
detainment altogether, since minimizing 
instances of misconduct means maximizing 
the chances for UCSD to hold this event in 
the future. 

Due to the personalized nature of the 
information linked to the barcode, wrist-
bands will act as one more barrier to ille-
gitimate sales and trades. Even though it 
is unlikely that this relatively sophisticated 
system will prevent students from trying 
to find loopholes, they should realize that 
by engaging in unauthorized sales, they are 
only putting themselves at higher risk for 
punishment. If students are found wear-
ing a bracelet that is tied to someone else’s 
information, they will have to face whatever 

During the A.S. Council gen-eral election, any individual can file a grievance against 
a candidate for an unfair violation 
of election bylaws. However, most of 
these are petty trivialities that don’t 
really have any place in a full hearing. 
Although the hearings maintain fair-
practice elections, holding them for 
minor quibbles and infractions and 
delaying the election process is thor-
oughly unnecessary.

We consider ourselves lucky that 
there were only two slates running 
this year because evaluating griev-
ances is a time-consuming process for 
everyone involved. When a grievance 
is filed, selection committee officials 
set a hearing to further investigate 
the case and determine whether the 
accused will be disqualified or sanc-
tioned. If a decision is disputed or not 
made (or if an individual found guilty 
does not want to issue a public apol-
ogy), the case can be appealed to the 
A.S. Judicial Board to further review 
the evidence. Unfortunately, election 
bylaws note that election results may 
not be announced until the current 
sitting A.S. president settles and rati-
fies all grievances and appeals.

Because of this tedious process, 
grievances have had a long history of 
significantly delaying the results of 
the A.S. Council elections. Though 
Council should hold hearings for 
serious offenses due to the possibility 
of a disqualification, the majority of 
hearings are held due to a variety of 
absurd reasons. Glossy poster paper 
and duct tape-related grievances are 
extremely tired topics for hearings, 
and the process for evaluating petty 
complaints during elections is in seri-
ous need of a rethink.

UCSD has even seen years where 
grievances were the cause of literally 
all election delays. The 2011–12 A.S. 
Council election, in fact, managed to 
set a record number of grievances. 
Due to a whopping 25 grievances filed 
against various slates and referendum 
campaigns, election results were 
pushed back three days. 

Though we’ve seen some 
improvement over the years, the 
current guidelines still allow for a 
repeat of the 2011 debacle. This year, 
results were delayed six hours due to 
the fact that Council still had griev-
ance hearings and three appeals to 
address before the announcement. 

The current process for evaluating 
grievances is necessary for more 
complicated and serious cases but 
is a waste of time for lowly, poster-
related offenses. 

A.S. Council should seriously 
consider updating and streamlining 
the grievance process for future elec-
tions. Historically repeated violations 
and offenses should have specific 
consequences, instead of an awkward, 
unnecessary hearing to deliver simple 
slap-on-the-wrist punishments. This 
would ultimately benefit all those who 
care about the elections and those 
involved in student government, not 
to mention all those eagerly awaiting 
election results. 

Because most hearings result in 
Council providing a simple warning 
or asking for a public apology, we 
think most people would agree with 
the Sweet Brown internet meme that 
“ain’t nobody got time for that.” Our 
paltry voter turnout shows that there 
are only a limited number of students 
who care about elections and what 
our student government does; long 
hours spent waiting on grievances 
on results night is no way to keep 
them interested.

Unnecessary Grievances Delay Election Results



drastic consequences the adminis-
tration deems appropriate.

In light of the havoc during last 
year’s festival, ASCE has come up with 
further security measures to prevent 
non-residents from keeping lodge on 
campus, particularly in International 
House and the Village. This is largely 
because both spaces have become 
drinking hot spots for many students, 
and security guards have had to roll 
more parties there than any other 
locations on campus. While this situ-
ation is not ideal and many students 
would like to have the privilege of 
inviting friends to their apartments, 
we have to realize this compromise 
is only necessary because we haven’t 

demonstrated responsibility in the 
past. The “no-host policy,” which dis-
allows non-residents from staying in 
residential areas, operates on the hope 
that eliminating access to liquor-rid-
den festivities will give students one 
less avenue through which to engage 
in misbehavior. Ultimately, this will 
reduce the number of arrests and vis-
its to local hospital wards. ID check-
points at I-House and the Village will 
ensure that these new regulations are 
enforced, but it is up to students to 
observe the regulations for the safety 
goals they represent, rather than sim-
ply partake in something equally irre-
sponsible elsewhere on campus. 

Though these changes are poten-
tially beneficial they do not execute 
themselves. It’s not enough that ASCE 

has come up with a possibly reme-
dial fix; effort needs to exist on both 
fronts for new policies to be effective. 
Students need to realize that they are 
solely in control of Sun God Festival’s 
fate and that these regulations would 
not be enforced had safety hazards not 
arisen in the first place.

 ASCE and the administration can 
pave the way to a festival with safer 
regulations, but it is our responsibil-
ity to make sure the event goes as 
smoothly as possible. This means 
being aware of both the freedoms and 
boundaries accompanying attendance 
of the event. The new wristband dis-
tribution system is a promising first 
step, but student awareness and coop-
eration is vital in maintaining this 
UCSD tradition.

Student Cooperation Will Ultimately Determine Festival’s Future
▶SUN GOD, from page 4

Dear Editor,
When I was a political science 

student, then-professor (and now Vice 
Chancellor) Alan Houston assigned a 
book by a guy named Machiavelli. It 
was a cautionary tale, but apparently 
Houston didn’t do the reading.

Houston announced a “no-host” 
policy will apply to the entire cam-
pus during the Sun God Festival. 
According to the policy, only UCSD 
students will be allowed in on-campus 
residence areas. 

This is blatantly unconstitutional. 
It violates the First Amendment’s right 
to free association belonging both to 
the on-campus residents and to their 
off-campus friends and family. 

Just imagine the consequences, 
and you’ll see what I mean: What if a 
student is dating a non-student who 
lives off campus? What if they’re mar-
ried to someone who lives off cam-
pus? What if someone’s mom wants to 

visit? Houston’s policy bans them all. 
But it gets worse. Houston told 

the A.S. Council that campus policy 
requires students to carry their UCSD 
identification card at all times while 
on campus, not just on the day of Sun 
God Festival. 

“Show me your papers”? 
Seriously? When did UCSD 

become Arizona? 
Though Houston’s actions are, 

sadly, par for the course for UCSD, 
there is a silver lining. The unconstitu-
tional tyranny of UCSD’s upper-level 
administrators inspired me and sever-
al of my classmates to become lawyers. 

Hopefully, these most recent, 
senseless intrusions into students’ 
personal lives (Again: Partners can’t 
sleep over on the day of Sun God 
Festival—are you kidding me?) will 
inspire a new generation of Tritons 
to become lawyers. With adminis-
trators like Houston, heaven knows 
they’re needed.

LETTER  TO  THE  EDITOR

Festival Restrictions 
Violate Student Rights

EMAIL YOUR LETTER TO OPINION@UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

THE GUARDIAN.



A n excellent indication that somebody has been living in San Diego too long is that they take its brewery scene for granted. Considering the swill imbibed in other cities, San Diego is a veritable mecca of breweries with powerhouses like Lagunitas 
and Stone within driving distance and local craftmasters Hess and Alesmith only a few miles 
from campus.

However, in this reviewer’s opinion, the best brewery to visit in San Diego is neither the 
aforementioned ones (despite their undeniable excellence) nor student favorite Greenflash 
but St. Archer’s brewery, located in Mira Mesa off Distribution Avenue.

In comparison to Green Flash, St. Archer’s tasting room looks quite quaint. Rather than 
a huge array of different brews lining the wall, it merely serves around eight drafts. Yet this 
focus, offering a few excellent beers rather than an overwhelming array of middling beers, is 
exactly what makes St. Archer’s the place to visit. Each beer simply feels like it was handled 
with individual care, distinctly smooth and flavorful without an overreliance on hops.

While fans of a very specific beer might rightfully want to seek a very specific brewery 
instead, for the best all-around selection of quality beers, there is no better place to visit 
than St. Archer’s. Still overlooked by many, its clean and modern tasting room is an excellent 
location to idle away the afternoon hours.

WEEKEND
BOTTOMS UP!

ST. ARCHER’S
Address: 9550 Distribution Ave., Mira Mesa
Hours:   Mon. through Thurs., 3 p.m. to 9 p.m.

Friday, 1 p.m. to 9 p.m.
Saturday, 12 p.m. to 9 p.m.

Pricing: $
Recommended Drink: The cask brew

NOBLE EXPERIMENT
Address: 777 G St., Gaslamp Quarter
 (inside Neighborhood Bar)
Hours: Tues. through Sun. 7 p.m. to 2 a.m.
Pricing: $$$
Recommended Drink: Dealer’s Choice

T here is something to be said for a bar that refuses to be easily found, necessitating an adventurous spirit to even locate its premises. Noble Experiment is such a place, being a throwback to the 1920s idea of a “speakeasy,” a secret bar historically meant 
as an illicit means to procure drinks during Prohibition. Indeed, the bar is located inside 
Neighborhood, a Gaslamp bar and eatery. On the way to The Neighborhood’s bathrooms, a wall 
of kegs can surreptitiously swing back, revealing a doorway to the speakeasy. With a reservation 
booked (which should be procured at least a week in advance), one can enter to explore its 
hidden riches).

The first thing to catch your eye should be the incredible wall of golden skulls on shelves filling 
one wall of the bar. But spectacle, both in such a gloriously morbid display and in the clandestine 
nature of the bar, is not what ultimately defines Noble Experiment. Rather, it is a tribute to true 
bartending, with every type of cocktail prepared with delicate term and utmost attention. This is 
the type of bar where one can ask the bartender to simply “surprise me!”

Noble Experiment is not a place one would want to, or even can, make their regular haunt. 
Drink prices are high, and the waiting time on reservations makes this a bar to visit only 
infrequently on special occasions. But in terms of pure quality, class and uniqueness, there is no 
finer place to visit in the Gaslamp Quarter.

THE SHOUT HOUSE
Address: 655 4th Ave., Gaslamp Quarter
Hours: Sunday through Thursday, 7 p.m. to 2 a.m.
           Friday 5 p.m. to 2 a.m.
           Saturday 6 p.m. to 2 a.m.
Pricing: $$ (doors), $ (drinks)
Recommended Drink: none

T he Shout House is an odd place to recommend. Its cocktail selection is overpriced and not made with any more care than the drinks in your average dive bar. Even its beer selection is adequate at best, with only the sports bar basics and perhaps one or two 
local beers on tap. 

Whatever inadequacies it may have in terms of alcohol, The Shout House makes up for it by 
being San Diego’s only dueling piano bar.

Indeed, the bar is not the center point of this venue at all. While its raised position occupies 
an entire side of the room, it’s merely a distraction, with most of the seating concentrated 
around the lower stage that features the true draw of this place. Any night of the week, two 
dueling pianists can be found on this stage taking requests (for a small fee) from the audience 
to rambunctiously play whatever song is requested of them, from Lady Gaga to Journey to the 
occasional Beethoven.

With bawdy jokes, shouting crowds and many a drunken bachelorette party, The Shout House 
is not the type of place to visit if you desire a quiet night with friends. 

If you want to get both shit-faced and sing (off key) at the top of your lungs, this is one of the 
few bars in San Diego that not only accommodates but encourages such behavior.

San Diego is a city so renowned for its extensive selection of home and microbrews, that it 
may be  difficult to decide where to sit down and grab a drink. Read up on just a handful of the 

Guardian’s top picks for unique drinking locations in America’s Finest City.

HAMILTON’S TAVERN
Address: 1521 30th St., South Park
Hours:  Monday through Friday: 3 p.m. to 2 a.m.
           Saturday, Sunday: 1 p.m. to 2 a.m.
Pricing: $$
Recommended Drink: Pliny the Elder

S an Diego has enough bars to cater to nearly any desire, replete with karaoke bars, dive bars, sports bars and whatever else one may want. However, for those who care less about the particular aesthetics and perks of a place and purely about the 
quality of beer on tap, there is no finer establishment in San Diego than Hamilton’s for the 
true beer connoisseur. 

here’s a certain elegance to Hamilton’s complete disregard for such frivolities. As “the 
oldest beer and wine licensed location in San Diego,” don’t be fooled by its appearance, which 
makes it seem like only a mere, local watering hole, loved due to necessity rather than choice. 
The tavern has perhaps the most impressive beer selection in San Diego.

The 28 taps and two casks here feature a selection of impeccably chosen beers, eschewing 
relying on standards (besides the necessities like Guinness). Instead, its blackboard is replete 
with such interesting choices as Monkey Paw Oatmeal Pale and Alpine Ugly IPA.

As an indication of its prowess, it’s noteworthy that Hamilton’s is one of the few bars in San 
Diego that regularly has Pliny the Elder (a near-legendary beer for IPA lovers) on tap.

Kudos also have to go to its bartenders who seem to have a certain knack for always being 
aware of waiting customers, ready to speedily assist in quenching another customer’s thirst.

B e an opening act for Taylor Swift. Check. Perform in sold out arenas across the nation. Check. Garner comparisons to 
the epic rock of U2 and The Fray. Also a check. 
Needtobreathe 
had all this going 
for them, but their 
success came with 
a cost.

Lead singer Bear 
and his brother Bo 
Rinehart form the 
nucleus of the band, 
which hails from 
Possum Kingdom, 
South Carolina. 
They were coming 
off their most suc-
cessful album “The 
Reckoning” in 2011. 
However, following 
a rough patch of 
infighting and the 
loss of their longtime 
drummer Joe Still-
well, they went back 
to the studio for a year of sporadic touring and 
recording, emerging with their newest project 
“Rivers in the Wasteland.”

Their first track, christened “Wasteland,” 
reflects the turbulent path the group had 
traversed up to that point. It is a contemplative 
combination of acoustic guitar, banjo and piano 
with lyrics that suggest that there is still a “crack 
in the door filled with light” that offers hope. In 
a moment of sentimentality, they pay homage to 
their roots with a spirited love song dedicated 
to their home in “Oh, Carolina.” Their lead 
single “The Heart” is the most upbeat track on 

the record, and it exudes energetic rhythms that 
make your toes want to tap — it positively de-
mands your heart be happy. The tune is boosted 
by an eclectic mixture of furiously-strumming 

strings, drums, tam-
bourines, claps and 
boisterous vocals.

Their final song on 
the album, “More Heart 
and Less Attack,” sums 
up Needtobreathe’s 
desire along this entire 
adventure: They col-
lectively pulled back 
from the daily grind in 
order to get to the heart 
of what initially made 
their music engaging. 
They have a renewed 
satisfaction in simplic-
ity, and this led to a 
stripped-down sound 
with fewer instruments 
and less technology. 
The whole record will 
undoubtedly sound 

great live because “Rivers in the Wasteland” 
has a wonderfully raw quality and brims with 
energy. The fact is that Needtobreathe came into 
this album lost in a proverbial wasteland, only 
to emerge with a newfound, positive outlook 
facilitated by their music. Ironically, this labor 
of love came out of a desire to get back to their 
roots and they did just that. They found their 
heart again.

ost know him as 
Lieutenant Sulu from 
the original 1960s 
“Star Trek” series, a 

role that garnered him a legion 
of devoted Trekkies, but since his 
major television debut, George 
Takei has risen to considerable fame 
outside the entertainment industry. 

With a vast resume of various roles 
in politics and mainstream media, 
which only bolstered his followings 
as one of the premier role models 
for the Asian-Pacific Island and 
LGBTQ* communities, Takei has 
put his fame to good use.

Whether it’s shedding light 
on his experience in Japanese-

American internment camps in 
his 2012 musical, “Allegiance,” 
or advocating for equality rights, 
Takei has had a major influence on 
social media. He has now released a 
documentary of his own life, “To Be 
Takei,” which premiered on April 17 
at the Pacific Arts Spring Showcase 
in San Diego. 

Guardian: What can you tell us 
about this movie, “To Be Takei,” at 
a glance?
George Takei: This documentary 
is a celebration of our [Brad Takei 
and my] marriage, our relationship 
over the last 27 years. But it’s also a 
movie about how my life began, not 
in the [happiest] circumstances.

G: What sorts of discussions do you 
hope people leave with after seeing 
this documentary?
GT: When the audience sees this 
film, I hope they will see two human 
beings and not stereotypes: loving 
and enjoying each other, building 
a life together. It really covers our 
struggle together — the struggle 
that we shared for social justice 
and now the 21st century civil 
rights movement for the LGBT 
community.

G: What events in your life inspired 
you to make this film?
GT: My childhood started with a 
very daunting obstacle overnight 
because of what happened at Pearl 
Harbor. American citizens of 
Japanese ancestry were looked at 
with fear, suspicion and outright 
hatred. This hysteria swept all over 
the nation, and an executive [order 
sent] all Japanese-Americans on 

the West Coast to be summarily 
rounded up and put in prisons — 
internment camps — such as the 
swamps of Arkansas, which was 
where our camp was settled. I was 
also gay, which I discovered when 
I was about ten or eleven years old, 
and so I was being hated for my race 
and being gay. 

G: What advice do you have for 
students or people aspiring for their 
dreams in any field of their passion?
GT: My parents taught me to 
be strong, unrelenting and have 
confidence in myself, which helped 
me to overcome whatever obstacles 
I had in life. Dedication, persistence 
and never giving up in life. There 
are always obstacles, and people 
are daunted by them, but have 
confidence in yourself. Don’t let 
those obstacles get you down, and 
if you believe in yourself that you 
have the talent, then you will able 
to overcome and succeed. Go out 
there: Activate and participate — 
as an informed citizen. This is the 
people’s democracy; it can be great 
if the people want it to be, so good 
people have to be engaged in the 
democratic process.

The Guardian visits two similarly themed juice bars, samples their best offerings and decides 
which will win a culinary duel for the last man standing. This week’s juice bars:

It might have been our large group of eight people 
walking through the doors of the comparatively 
small residential-esque cottage, or maybe it was 
just the general demeanor of juice bar workers, but 
suffice it to say, our group was not greeted with a 
warm welcome. And though the menu is rather 

extensive, it fails to provide information on what the “acai” and “pitaya” bowls actually are. 
Unfortunately, the staff isn’t too knowledgeable about what the distinction between the two 
is either. Their vague response that “they’re just different colors” didn’t help provide detail on 
the flavor of each fruit, so after much deliberation, the Pitaya Bowl ($6.75) was the bowl of 
choice, mainly because it was pretty. Luckily, the pretty, pink fruit bowl ended up being the 
right decision because it was a delicious blend of pitaya (dragon fruit), pineapple, coconut 
butter and coconut water that’s topped with banana, raw coconut flakes and hemp-seed 
granola. The store worker was partly right: The acai and pitaya bowls are very different in 
color, but also different in taste. The Acai Bowl ($6.75) has a creamier and slightly tart taste 
which focuses more on the berry flavor versus the Pitaya, which is sweeter and has a tropi-
cal tang. Both bowls have fresh, sliced bananas on top, with the smooth, blended texture 
nicely complementing the granola. Though the acai and pitaya bowls are a bit pricey, they 
are big enough to share with friends. 

Though Juice Kaboose is much smaller than 
Nekter, the big group didn’t seem to bother 
the staff; they were far more welcoming 
than Nekter’s. Our group ordered the same 
items, the Pitaya Bowl ($7) and an Acai 
Bowl ($6). Unlike the white bowls at Nek-

ter, the bowls at Juice Kaboose are served in 32 oz. clear cups so you can see the layers 
of fruit and the difference in color between the pitaya and acai. The taste and size of each 
was fairly similar to the bowls at Nekter; the only difference is that Juice Kaboose puts 
mangoes, strawberries, blueberries and bananas on top, which they buy daily. The variety 
of freshly chopped fruit adds a refreshing quality to the semi-frozen texture of the acai 
and pitaya. In addition to the fresh fruit, the hemp granola is sprinkled generously on 
top and provides a nice crunch that helps bring the whole dish together with the perfect 
combination of crunch, smoothness and freshness. Keeping customers informed about 
what goes into the food seems to be more important, since Juice Kaboose is somewhat of 
an institution in La Jolla and was the first place in the area to sell acai and pitaya bowls. 
The cashier was able to provide more details on acai and pitaya than “they’re just different 
colors,” as she explained that they both have different health benefits and that each fruit is 
packed with antioxidants, vitamin C and magnesium.

JUICE KABOOSE
Juice Kaboose. Juice Kaboose in part pioneered the juicing/fruit bowl trend in La Jolla, making it a popular destination among locals for a reason. The over-
all care and quality that goes into their juices and bowls is top-notch. While the price point is fairly equal between the two juice bars, the overall service 
was far superior at Juice Kaboose. Also, the atmosphere at Juice Kaboose is slightly less pretentious, which is nice, considering that not every passerby 
is an acai or pitaya connoisseur.

George and Brad Takei arrive at Pacific Arts Movement’s 4th Annual Spring Showcase at Mission Valley for 
the premiere of the biographical documentary “To Be Takei” on April 17.



F orming just under a year ago, Smallpools went from an unknown Hollywood-
based band to a summertime 
anthem sensation with its lead 
single “Dreaming,” released May 
2013. The four-man band — Sean 

Scanlon (lyrics, keyboard), Mike 
Kamerman (guitar), Joseph Intile 
(bass) and Beau Kuther (drums) — 
released their self-titled EP last July 
and have gone on to tour (or are 
scheduled to tour) with artists such 
as Grouplove, Walk the Moon and 

Neon Trees. A full length album is 
set to be released sometime in the 
summer. With such a formidable 
amount of success in such a small 
span of time, it was truly an act of 
God (or University Centers) to have 
Smallpools play at UCSD’s very 
own Porter’s Pub — absolutely free 
of cost for UCSD students.

The opening acts for Smallpools 
were bands that drew their roots 
from UCSD or the San Diego area. 
Fighting with Irons’ Paul Gillcrist 
(a recent UCSD alum) warmed up 
the crowd with ukulele-led songs 
new and old, hitting a high point 
with their lively cover of “Kids” 
by MGMT. Following Irons were 
the relaxing beach/indie sounds 

and three-part melodies of Ed 
Ghost Tucker, composed of two 
UCSD alums — brother and sister 
Cameron and Michaela Wilson. 
The band’s eclectic sounds showed 
a wide breadth of talent, and Ed 
Ghost Tucker will be sharing their 
talent with us all in a soon-to-be 
released EP.

Then came the much-anticipated 
and crowd-gathering Smallpools. 
If there is one thing that is special 
about going to a concert at Porter’s 
Pub, it is the intimacy that its small 
setting provides. Although you may 
or may not remember those DVC-
headlined dances in the confines of 
Porter’s, keep in mind that the hot 
and sweaty dance floor has become 

a place to get up close and personal 
with a band or musician — and a 
place where the conversational and 
easygoing Smallpools can crack a 
few jokes.

“If you’re familiar with our band, 
we just piled through half of our 
songs,” Scanlon joked after opening 
with “Mason Jar” and “No Story 
Time” off their EP. “We’ll be out of 
here in seven more minutes!”

As the band progressed from 
unreleased songs about the 
“dumb parties in Hollywood” and 
living life, it was apparent that 
not only did the audience enjoy 
the performance but so did the 
band members. While making 
full use of the snug stage, with 
Kamerman and Intile head bobbing 
and dancing around, Smallpools 
showed an uncanny stage prowess 
and eagerness to entertain with 
catchy riffs and dancey indie-
pop-rock music. And Smallpools 
especially showed that they’re a 
band to look out for and a band you 
want to catch a ride with on their 
continuing rise to fame.

In a time where EDM seems 
to be taking over the popular 
music of today’s youth, there is 
hope for a band like Smallpools, 
which embodies incredible talent, 
passion and a sense of humor that 
will always keep them grounded 
and personable. When Smallpools 
closed with none other than 
“Dreaming” and made the audience 
move, shake, groove and twist in 
every which way, there was only 
one question on everyone’s mind: 
Please, God, tell us when their full-
length album is coming out.

The UCSD men’s and women’s tennis 
teams ended their regular seasons this 
past week as the men suffered an away 
loss against the Division-I UCLA team 
on Wednesday, March 16, and the 
women enjoyed a home-field landslide 
victory against Cal State Stanislaus on 
Friday, March 18. 

The No. 11 men’s team, faced off 
against Division-I, No. 5 UCLA, and 
despite a valiant effort, lost with a final 
score of 5–0. 

“We were up against a really 
good team from Division I, and as a 
Division-II team, it was a challenging 
meet overall,” junior Kona Luu said. 
“Despite the loss, it was a great way for 
us to test the upper competition and 
see how they perform and build some 
more experience.”

The UCLA Bruins won the doubles 
matchup with victories in the No. 1 and 
No. 2 slots. For the No. 1 match, the 
Bruins took down the No. 17 ranked 
duo senior Max Jiganti and Luu in 
an 8–0 shutout. Freshman Alexandre 
Miaule and sophomore Horea Porutiu 
fell 8–3 in the No. 2 contest. 

The Bruins took the first four singles 
matches in straight sets, led by junior 
Marcos Giron, who is ranked fifth at 
the national level. 

“We had a strong season despite 
how tough it was,” UCSD men’s head 
coach Timmer Willing said. “[We] 
started it off really well, and it was just 
a bit shaky at the end, [but] we still 
have a likely chance of making it to the 

NCAA championships.”
The Triton women’s final match 

concluded their season on a high note, 
with a blowout victory of 9–0 over Cal 
State Stanislaus on senior night. The 
Tritons only allowed five points overall 
in their three doubles matches and also 
managed to win five of the six singles 
matches in straight sets.

“It was a great way to end the season,” 
women’s head coach Liz LaPlante said. 
“We knew it was a team we could beat, 
and we did just that. It was also a great 
way to send off our seniors who have 
played so well here.”

Seniors Tara Vanooteghem 
and Laura Wilke wrapped up their 
collegiate careers as the No. 3 duo, 
winning with a stellar score of 8–0. 
The pair managed to finish the season 
with a 14–10 winning record. They 
both also cruised through their singles 
matches with Vanooteghem winning 
her No. 4 match 6–0, 6–1 and Wilke 
taking her No. 6 slot 6–0, 6–1.

“We didn’t have a great year overall 
as we lost to teams that we should have 
beaten,” LaPlante said. “However, it 
was a great learning experience for the 
young team, and now we just hope to 
come back stronger.”

With the Triton women’s season 
behind them, the UCSD men’s team 
will await NCAA championship 
qualifying announcements on 
April 29. Nationals will take place 
in Altamonte Springs, Florida from 
May 14 to May 17.

UCSD Finishes With Three Wins in 
Nine Events at Stanford Invitational

MEN'S  CREW

UCSD struggled in harsh conditions on Friday evening before bouncing back with 
wins in two Varsity 8 races and Freshman 8, look next toward Western Invitational. 

The UCSD men’s crew team re-
turned from Redwood Shores with 
three victories out of nine total races 
at the Stanford Invitational this past 
weekend. With such a young team, the 
mixed results come right as the rowers 
are finally settling into their crews. 

“[We went] up against a couple of 
top teams, like Stanford, that have a lot 
of speed,” head coach Zach Johnson 
told the UCSD Guardian. “I think we 
did pretty well.”

The invitational opened last Fri-
day night as crews braved 20 mph 
headwinds and chop in the northern 
California basin, slowing boat times 
considerably. No. 13 nationally ranked 
Stanford defeated UCSD in all three of 
the evening’s races, beginning with its 
6 minutes, 23.7 seconds time to UC-
SD’s 6:44.1 in the Varsity 8. The second 

Varsity 8 suffered the same fate, com-
ing across the line at 7:05.2 compared 
to the Cardinal’s 6:44.5. The Freshman 
8 managed the closest race of the eve-
ning, finishing 6:37.4 with Stanford 
ahead at 6:33.9.

On Saturday, improved conditions 
resulted in dramatically lowered boat 
times. UCSD began the second day 
with a loss to local foe University of 
San Diego in the Varsity 8 heat. The 
Tritons clocked in at 6:11.6, more than 
10 seconds faster than their Friday 
time and only three seconds behind 
the USD boat. Following the early 
loss, the Varsity 8 crew then recorded 
UCSD’s first victory in its second heat 
with a time of 6:35.5, besting UC Davis 
by nearly 40 seconds. 

“Several of our guys are new, and we 
changed the lineup around some for 
the last race.” Johnson said. “That last 
race against Davis, we found some-
thing that worked well and we gained 

a lot of speed.”
The Tritons lost against USD in 

the first of two second Varsity 8 
matchups on Saturday, but snuck 
past Santa Clara University in the 
following second Varsity 8 race with 
a time of 6:26.9. 

The Freshman 8 continued UCSD’s 
success against the Aggies with a 
ten-second win (6:39.4) over Davis 
(6:50.4), but lost to UC Berkeley in the 
second Freshman 8 heat.

“Coming off of this last weekend, 
each race we got a little better, a little 
faster,” junior varsity team captain Sean 
Dougherty told the UCSD Guardian. 
“Switching around some guys really 
worked out and now we’re going to fo-
cus on fine-tuning the lineups.”

With plenty of preparation time 
before their next competition, the 
Tritons intend on working on their 
speed to prepare for the champion-
ship season.

“We’re focusing on what we have 
to do to take down Gonzaga and 
USD,” Dougherty said. “We don’t just 
want to get to the championships; we 
want to get there and place well. We 
want to win.” 

The Tritons have nearly a month-
long break before resuming action at 
the Western Invitational on Saturday, 
May 17 in Rancho Cordova. The invite 
will be the final race before the IRA 
National Championships take place at 
the end of May in New Jersey.

WWPA CHAMPIONSHIPS PREVIEW

Entering tomorrow’s Western Water Polo Association conference tournament as the No. 1 seed and this year’s defending champions, the No. 14 UCSD women’s water polo team has 
great expectations. 

The Tritons are on a seven-game winning streak, having brought 
home UCSD’s first ever Harper Cup in their 
final regular season contest last Friday, and 
their 24–10 record is far superior to any 
of the other four competing squads. This 
season’s squad also has a UCSD-record 
seven All-WWPA first team members 
on this season’s squad, including second 
time WWPA Player of the Year senior 
utility player Sarah Lizotte. And on top of 
everything, the tournament will be hosted 
on home turf at UCSD’s Canyonview Pool.

With so much momentum appearing 
on the side of blue and gold, UCSD is 
shooting for no less than the crown with a 
highly focused mindset. 

“Obviously [we’re] aiming to win the 
automatic bid to the NCAAs,” senior utility 
player Leah Gonzales said. “But I think a 
lot of times, it’s easy to overlook or take 
for granted the teams in our conference. 
They’ve worked as hard as we have.”

The WWPA tournament is essentially 
a “win or go home” scenario, as the 
champion will qualify for a national championship berth and the losers 
simply have their seasons cut short. 

“If you lose, you’re done,” UCSD head coach Brad Kreutzkamp said. 
“That’s a lot of pressure, especially for seniors who know this could be 
their last game ever.” 

However, carrying a 4–0 record in WWPA play, the top-seeded 

Tritons already have a leg up on opponents, as UCSD is exempt from 
Friday’s action with a first-round bye and will play their first match on 
Saturday afternoon. While UCSD must wait until the conclusion of the 
Saturday morning game to know who its opponent will be, the Tritons 
are ready to battle any of their conference foes. 

“Whomever we face, we’ll be prepared,” 
Lizotte todl the UCSD Guardian. “[Our] 
biggest strength is our depth and our 
speed.”

Gonzales, who won the Harper Cup 
MVP award last week, also pointed out the 
importance of home pool advantage. 

“When we go up north to play them, 
they have really small pools,” Gonzales 
said. “Playing a game in a small pool is 
a lot different than in our pool because 
[ours] is almost 1 1/2 times the length. 
[So] it’s harder for them to keep up with 
us.”  

The Tritons will be led by Lizotte — 
who has racked up a team-leading 73 
goals and 47 assists — along with junior 
attacker Jolene Guiliana who herself has 
netted 58 scores and 46 assists over the 
2014 campaign. Sophomore goalkeeper 
Courtney Miller will mind the net for 
UCSD. 

The Tritons’ postseason journey begins 
on Saturday, April 26 at Canyonview at 3 p.m. against the winner of the 
11 a.m. contest. The third-place game is slated for 11 a.m. on Sunday, 
with the championship match scheduled for 1 p.m.

“We don’t want to leave any room for error,” Lizotte said. “If we play 
smart, and if we play the way we have been playing, things will go our 
way.”
