a aHleground - Del Mar 
voters will decide tomorrow 
whether or not they want a 
123-room hotel built on pro-
perty at the corner of 15th 
Street and Camino Del Mar,

across the street. If the prop-
osal to construct the inn is

Del Mar voters to decide 
if they want another inn 
By JAMES GILMORE 
Stll/J Writ~r 

Del Mar residents will go to 
the polls tomorrow to determine 
the future of the most recent plan . 
for a proposed hotel and retail 
development in the heart of 
downtown Del Mar. The devel-
opment has been the focus of a 
debate which has divided the 
community and put slow- and 
pro-growth advocates at log-
gerheads. 

The proposal of landowner 
Jim Watkins, which calls for the 
construction of a I 23-room hotel, 
12 time-share condominiums, 
4,700 square feet of retail shops, 
underground parking and a small 
park on the corner of 15th Street 
and Camino Del Mar, is the 
second plan submitted to appro-
val by residents . The first prop-
osal was defeated by 15 votes on 
Sept. 22 . This second plan, which 
is two hotel rooms and 12 con-
dominiums smaller than the ear-
lier one, calls for a 39 percent 
reduction in retail space and 
doubles the size of the park . 

The Del Mar hamber of 
Commerce unanimously en -

dorsed the plan last month. "We 
feel it will be a very positive addi-
tion to the community," said 
President Jim Coleman, adding 
that it would provide $300,000 to 
the city annually in room tax 
revenue and 60 mete.red parking 
spaces for the city. 

Watkins said the project will 
provide a community center for 
civic and cultural activities while 
the design of his proposed Cha-
teau Del Mar will contribute to 
the "Old World" atmosphere 
downtown. In addition, Watkins 
has agreed to provide $1 million 
for the construction of a new city 
library, the current library being 
housed in a trailer behind city 
hall . 

According to Bill Malone of 
Citizens for Sensible Growth, 
this second proposal is still 
unacceptable. "The main feature 
in my eyes, and in most people's 
eyes, is the hotel," Malone said. 
"Two rooms is not a significant 
reduction. In my opinion he is 
forcing us to vote a second time 
on the same thing." 

Opponent of the revised plan 
are insisting that a smaller hotel 
for the commercial iteisaviable 

alternative. Roughly two-thirds 
of the 5.2-acre site is currently 
zoned for residential develop-
ment and one-third for commer-
cial. The proposal offered by 
Watkins would change the zon-
ing to allow for the development 
of the hotel. 

Malone says he would prefer 
that there be no zoning changes, 
and that a smaller hotel be built 
on the commercially zoned pro-
perty and residences on the other 
portion . "The residences will 
better serve the re idents," 
Malone said , "whereas the hotel 
only serves people coming from 
out of town . Del Mar is already 
overrun by people from out of 
town , we don't need to draw 
more people here." 

Del Mar City Council candi-
date John Gillies expressed a 
similar concern: "We don't need 
all the traffic and all the conges-
tion in a large hotel will bring. 
but I do feel a large segment of 
the community would like a hotel 
on the property." Along with 
Councilwoman Brooke Ei en-
berg, Gillies has started working 
on an alternate plan for a smalle r

Union protests 
wage hike delay 
By PORSCHE SHANTZ 
Staff Wr;t~r 

An unfair labor- pra c t ic e 
charge has been filed against the 
University of California by the 
American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Em-
ployees (AFSCME) Council 10 
- the union for all UC staff 
employees . The Un iversity is 
charged with bargaining in bad 
faith . 

A stalemate between the Uni-
ver ity and the Union over a 
wage package offered to patient 
care technical (PCT) employees 
led to the formation of a three-
member fact-finding panel con-
sisting of representatives from 
the University and the Union 
and a neutral chairman, Gerald 
Burke. chosen by both parties. 

The panel met in November 
1987 to review the issues in 
dispute and held a fact-finding 
hearing in December. Chairman 
Gerald Burke then announced 
the panel ' recommendation that 
all PCT employee should receive 
a minimum 3 percent wage 
increase. 

The University then moved up 
the effective date of any increase 
for PCT employees from July I , 
1987 to Jan. 1, 1988. 

"The University is not showing 
any appreciation for those people 
who are in our mo t critical life-
saving areas of employment , 
those employees who see after 
the well-being of patients. It i 
unbelievable that the University 
doesn't see fit to compensate 
employees who work in 
those areas," said AFSCM E 
Council 10 President Oliver 
Preston. 

The San Diego Office of 
AFSCME Council 10 is tenta-
tively planning an informational 
picket at the UCSD Medical 

Center to protest the U niversi-
ty 's act ions. 

" It i because of the employees 
that the medical center is one of 
the top 24 in the nation ," sa id 
There a Pascual-Valloadol ic. 
AFSCME Council representa-
tive for UCSD. "The University 
wants to accept that its medical 
centers are first- rate facilities , 
but they aren't willing to pay 
their employees the first-rate 
pay." 

A study done by AFSCME 
regarding payroll costs and sal-
ary patterns for all five medical 
centers (Irvine , Davis , San 
Diego, San Francisco and Los 
Angeles) revealed that for 1984-
85 top administrators received a 
payroll increa e of about 15.8 
percent and in 1985-86 a 10.2 
percent increase. In total, accord-
ing to the study, top administra-
tors at the medical centers re-
ceived a 49 percent payroll in-
crease since 1982. 

These finding were based on 
document officially filed with 
the statewide Health, Planning 
and Development Office in Sac-
ramento. 

A study done by AFSCME's 
San Diego office found that top 
administrators at the UCSD 
medical center have received a 13 
percent payroll increase, while 
employee have only received a 3 
percent increa e over the same 
time interval. 

The Union's rationale for these 
investigations is to support the 
judgement made by the indepen-
dent arbitrator that the Univer-
sity can afford wage increases for 
its employees. 

"The University has never 
argued that they did not have the 
money to' give the increases," 
aid Pascual-Valladolid , "but as 

long as management feels that 
they can get away with some-
thing they'll keep doing it." [Q]

Del Mar 
Continued fr o m pale 1 
hotel of 70 rooms. If Watkins' 
proposal is rejected by residents , 
the two councilmembers will take 
their alternate plan before the 
city council, seeking its endor-
sement. Gillies said he hopes his 
plan could then be used to set 
guidelines for Watkins. 

Gillies used the figures from 
Watkins' 1986 investment pros-
pectus in composing his alter-
nate plan. The document claims 
that a 130-room hotel and 24 
time-share condominiums would 
generate an annual return on the 
investment of 119 percent with a 
net cash surplus after 20 years of 
over $63 million. By sca ling down 
the numbers, Gillies claims a 70-
room hotel would generate an 
over 60 percent annual return on 
the investment. Watkins claims a 
70-room hotel is not economi-
cally viable, that those figures 
are over two years old and no 
longer apply to the scaled-down 
project. Gillies disagrees: " His 
[Watkins1 own consultant, who 
is a financial analyst , said that 
any hotel that generates between 
12 percent and 15 percent is eco-
nomically viable, so wejust don't 
see where his claims that a small 
hotel isn't viable come from." 

If residents reject his proposal 
tomorrow, Watkins is prepared 
to go forward with another plan 
for a shopping center and 41 
condominiums on the site in 
compliance with the present zon-
ing. In accordancewith Measure 
B, the 1986 Downtown Initia-

tive, voter-approval is required 
for all downtown commercial 
development. The pia n, which 
calls for 35 to 40 stores, would 
appear on the June ballot. 

Watkins says there's no possi-
bility he will build a smaller plan , 
and that the choice is a first-class 
inn or a shopping center. 

According to Chamber of 
Commerce president Coleman, 
if residents reject Watkins' alter-
nate proposal for a shopping 
center, the developer can then 
sue the city for adverse condem-
nation, claiming that the city 
prevents him from building in 
accordance with the zoning. This 
would, according to Coleman, 
condemn Watkins' property, re-
quiring that it be purchased by 
the city. "Every court case on 
adverse condemnation in Cali-
fornia has been decided in favor 
of the property owner," Cole-
man said . 'The bottom line is the 
city of Del Mar doesn't have the 
multi-millions it would take to 
buy that commercial property." 

Both supporters and oppo-
nents of the plan expect tomor-
row's vote to be close. " I think 
people are afraid because of the 
development happening around 
us ," Watkins aid, "and I can 
understand that; that's why I 
think the inn is so badly needed. 

;'The reason people like Del 
Mar," Malone said, "is because · 
it 's small. What these developers 
are trying to do is make it 'big-
time,' it's going to destroy the 
very thing that everybody loves. 
We're trying to keep Del Mar the 
charming place that it is ." 1m

CIA Ads 
I n an open editorial last quarter, we asked the 

campus community to comment on the advisability 
of running advertisements from the Centrallntelli-
gence Agency in the Guardian, 

What we were trying to do wa get a sense of 
"community standard ," we received a wide ariety 
of responses, for which we are grateful. 

Com munity standards are an elusive thing - j ust 
ask the U.S. Supreme Court, which aid porn-
ographic movies could be censored if uch standards 
were violated , thus sentencing hundreds of lower 
court judges to repeated showings of video garbage 
in a mostly fruitless search for those standards. 

A university community's standards are ideally a 
broad as possible. The Universi ty of California's 
mission is to bring toget her people from different 
cultures and different value ystems to learn from 
and study one anot h er. Conseq uent ly, the prejUdice 
at a university should always be in favor of allowing 
different , even unpopular political and social 
expressio ns. 

The Guardian confronts this issue twice weekly in 
its editorial and adverti ing ections . The first 
amendment to the U.S . constitution guarantees u a 
free press (at least until the Supreme Court extends 
censorship from high school to college papers), and 
as part of that freedom, we decide what we want.to 
print , balancing the desire to inform t~e communl~y 
against the knowledge that offendmg people IS 
sometimes part of our job. 

Nevertheless, we make decisions not to print 
some material. We will not accept ads that appeal to 
racist and sexist interest. We will not , for example, 
accept advertising from Penthouse magazine or 976 
"sex line" phone services, and we have in the past 
turned down requests for advertising space from the 
Ku Klux K lan. 

For similar reasons, the editorial board of the 
Guardian has decided we will no longer accept 
advertising from the C IA. 

There are a number of important reaso ns for 
denying the C IA advertising access we almost 
always grant. A glance at the list would include the 
illegal supply of arms to Somacista terrorists in and 
o ut of Nicaragua, attempted and actual murder of 
foreign leaders, corruption of national election in 
C hile , Italy and else where and training in torture 
and repression for CIA - counterparts throughout 
the world . 

The most important reason for not accepting CI A 
ads , though, is the international character of this 
ca mpus, a character shortly to be augmented by the 
addition of Fifth College. We don 't run ads lor the 
KKK because it would deeply and personally offend 
Black s tudents; we don't run ads for the C I A 
because there are students here who have had their 
lives and countries tragica lly disrupted by C IA and 
CIA-supported activity - fa mily members "disap-
peared" in Chile, tortured in Iran or tear-gassed in 
South Korea . 

Accepting ads from the CIA is inse nsitive and an 
insult to our friends and associates in the inter-
na t ional community. 

One argument needs to be addressed : the C IA , 
people sa y, is an easy target , unpopular and not a 
maj or revenue-producing advertiser. Why not ban 
all military ad s or ban ads f rom H o ney well and . 
Goodyear and other major defense cont ractors? 

There's no easy answer. W e live in, as Bob Dylan 
si ngs , "a s hadowy world ; skies are sli ppery gray." 
There are few black and white political a nd moral 
choices . 

W e have decided that we can not in good con-
science profit from or encourage membership in 
the CIA in particular. The CIA is a black hat. 

It's a contribution.

Letters 
Criticism of Tough Parking Law 
Gets an Irritated Assent 

Editor: 
I am writing to say that I am in 

complete agreement with Tom 
Nowa kowski's letter on UCSD park-
ing enforceme nt (Guardian, Feb. I ,). 
The parking officers here do not act 
as a public- ervice o rganizatio n, but 
rather a revenue-raising one. The 
parking police seem to spend very 
little effort protecting the cars from 
all the vandalism and theft in the 
parking lot . I nstead, they search for 
any minor infraction in the way the 
car are parked . 

For example, a few days ago I 
accompanied a friend of mine to his 
car in the Warren parking lot. W e 
lOok off his car cover, which had 
been locked on, and found a ticket 
on the windshield for no front license 
plate . We rushed ovcr to the parking 
office and askcd the officer on duty 
why my friend had gotten the ticket. 
He replied that the ticketing officer 
must have noticed the infraction 
while looking under the cover for a 
parking permit. 

This could not have been the case 
because the car cover had been pulled 
up 10 display the permit on the rear 
bumper of the car. AI 0, in his/ her 
eagerness to write up a ticket, the 
officer had neglected to fully scruti n-
ize the fro nt bumper of the car 
because there was a license plate 
mounted correctly on the right front 
side of the car. 

One could say that everyone makes 
mistakes. but what right do the 

parking officers have to be looking 
under loc ked car covers? The con-
stitut io n of this country states that 
we are innocent until proven guilty . 
Certainly the UCS D parking officers 
have no right to violate Ihe assump-
tion of innocence and look for guilt 
under a locked car cover. 

This weekend I had another run-
in with the parking officials here 
when so me friend s of mine came to 
visit me from northern California . 
As soo n as they had arrived on 
campus and begun unloading their 
luggage, th e Warre n apartment's 
security officer wrote them a $32 
ticket for parking in a fire lane. What 
the officer had failed to take into 
account was that \there was another 
car parked in the six feet of ye llow 
loading zone and that my friends'car 
was parked as close to that loading 
zo ne as possi ble . 

This officer had written this ticket 
and disa ppeared in the time it takes 
for me to walk from the loading zone 
to my apartment and back . Surely he 
co uld have waited a few moments to 
see if perhaps this car, which was 
packed full of luggage, was being 
unloaded . 

Parking at UCSD is definitely a 
problem, but the current policies of 
the parking department are certainly 
not the solution . What we need is 
more spaces to combat the shortage 
of parking here, not bloodthirsty 
parking enforcement.

Get a Little Bold in the 
Opinion Section, Guardian 
Editor: 

After read ing the letterfrom Mar-
got Waltz (Jan . 19), I felt compelled 
to write this letter. I 'm not sure 
whether I understand what aspect of 
journalism shewants you to improve , 
but I have a few co mme nts and com-
plaints of my own! 

Well, first of all I think the 
Guardian has lost some meat, some 
flair , and some personal touch. The 
Guardian is dominated by news , 
new~. news. from the sports page to 
the coverstories' Whatever happened 
to the opinion editor? The opinion 
section is often a mass of letters and 
"A Little Q & A." There i~n't any 
moving political discus~ion , no 

marker for important political events. 
Even your opinions seem like news 
items. Maybe I just miss old [former 
Guardian editor] Matthew Cronin , 
(a lthough [ often felt he was dead left 
wing and very long.) He made me 
think! The opinion section now 
doesn't make me think; it seems 
scattered and it's boring. (The Q & A 
stuff is cute , but shallow, hence 
boring.) 

On the pos itive side. the cover is 
great for flat news. The writers in 
general are good, professio nal jour-
nalists . But, now I think I know what 
Margot was a king for. . . or what [ 
am a king for: Does someone on 
your taff have a perwa~ive l person-

'Swim Fags' 
Redux 
Editor: 

In your Feb. 4 issue, the 
"Swim Fags" basketball team 
responded to my objcction to 
their name by saying "we refer 
to the word 'fag' as meaning 
tedious work or drudgery." I 
am glad to read that they had 
"no intention of mock.ing gay 
people." 

To clarify my own intentions, 
I am sorry if they feel I implied 
thay a~ all right-wing relilioUl 
bigots , I don't know what their 
religions or politics are. Mv 
point was that such bigotry 
fuels the persecution of homo-
sexuals through overt actions 
and insidious innuendos. 

"Swim Fags" say that in 
assuming "fags" refers to homo-

, sexuals, I am stereotyping. Yes, 
I am. Although some people 
might also think of the word 
drudgery. nine out often people 
in California in 1988 are going 
to assume first that fags refers 
to homosexuals, despite wbat 
"Swim Fap" say their intention 
is. I am only asking that people 
be aware of the painful impli-
cations of their words. If you 
don'\ intend to mock gay 
people, dOD'! do it.

According to Debbie H uggin , an instructor at UCSD, nearly 5.000 
people drown each year within 
10 feet of the water's edge . 
Drowning i the econd leading 
cause of death in the United 
States for people between the 
age of four and 44_ According 
to the American Red Cross , two-
thirds of those would not have 
died had they taken swimming 
classes. If you don't know how to 
swim, or if you do, and want to 
find a summer job that doesn't 
require shoes, UCSD has a swim 
class for you . The classes are 
offered at all skill levels and are 
free for registered students . 

Huggins , who also teaches 
UCSD gymnast ics, described 
some of the physical benefits for 
taking swim classes. "Swimming 
is the best overall exerci e for 
co ndit io ning," Huggin said. " It 
trengthen the heart muscle and 

uses practially every muscle in 
the body. Also, ince swimming 
is an aerobic exercise it ha car-
diovascular benefi ts due to the 
cons tant breath ing," she added. 

She also described the physi-
ology involved in swimming, as 
opposed to exercises such as 
running. "In runni ng, each step 
ends a vibration which must be 

a bsorbed by the join t' cartilage. 
I n swimmi ng, since it is non-
weight bearing and uses the 
medium of water as a resistance, 
there is not as much stress to the 
joints," Huggin said . 

Besidc;;~ cost and health, there 
are other advantages in taking 
swim classes here at UCSD. The 
swi m program is unique because 
it is specifically organized ~o that 
a perso n at any swimming level 
can progress at his or her indi-
vid ual pace . For example, a per-
son who i te rrified at the thought 
of ge tting his or her head wet , 
ca n even tua ll y advance to swim 
instructor.

Fasting for S.D. 
By ELEONOR CASTILLO 

Even though Christmas has come and gone, the spirit of 
giving still continues at UCSD. 

The Inter-College Residence HaU Association (ICRHA) is 
sponsoring a "Meal Skip" scheduled for Feb. 17. To panici-
pate. students with meal cards can sign up until Feb. 10 at any 
of the dining facilities on campus, or at resident deans' offices. 
The money .raised will ~nofit the saa Diego Food sank. 

By the end of this week-long campaign, I.e. R. H.A. hopes to 
raise at least 52,000 to feed the hungry people of San Diego. 
According to coordinator Andrea Gillin, "people wute an 
incredible amount of meals each week. It would help if they 
would just realize the fact that the meal they would donate is 
only one out of hundreds that they eat. Every donation makes 
us one step closer to relieving the problem," Gillin said. ~

yea rs." Harrison added that it 
was the in structors , such as 
Ch uck Millenbah , who made lhe 
classes fun and non-stressful as 
well as ed ucative. "Chuck helped 
everyone to meet each other and 
have a good time. We even had a 
parly a nd awards ceremony at 

the end." she said. 
Eileen Sussex took W.S.1. last 

fall and now teaches children's . 
swimming. Like Harrison , she 
a lso stre sed how fun the class 
was . "We learned the necessary 
skills for teaching." Sussex said. 
"but the whole time we got to 
know each other, have fun, and 
play games like inner-lube water 
polo. " 

One class offered is especially 
designed for no n- wimm!'r~ 

Acco rding to H uggins, many 
adults in San Diego still do not 
know how to swim. Around a 
coastal community people tend 
to take swimming for granted . 
But Huggins showed the impor-
tance of swimming by compar-
ing UCSD to schools on the East 
Coast. S he said ma ny Eastern 
colleges, such as Old Dominion 
Universi ty in Virginia, require a 
student to pass a swim test in 
order to graduate. 

Although no such test is requir-
ed, UCSD offers a class for non-
swimmers which Huggins called 
"easi ly the most rewarding class" 
she teaches. "I get people who 
have complete wa ter anxiety ... 
who have never had their head 
submerged," she said. "By the end 
of the course t hey are jumping off 
the diving board and swi mming 
to the other side of the pool." 

Huggins also teaches a class 
on swim conditioning. Conditio-

ning classes are more of a sche-
duled workout as o pposed to 
learning new skills. I n her class, 
students are required to keep a 
training log which records blood 
pressure, heart rate, fatigue level, 
and other information conducive 
to maintaining overall fitness. 
Susan Hylen, a Warren College 
stude nt, said the swim condition-
ing class was good for her be-
cause attendance was requi red.

CSUSB Coyotes eat Tritons alive 
Triton men 
frustrated by 
CSUSB defense 
By MICHAEL U'REN 
Staff Writer 

On Friday night, the UCSD 
Men's basketball team took on 
one of the best Division III teams 
in the nation in front of a packed 
hou e. The Co otes of Cal State 

an Bernadino are one of the top 
fifteen teams in Division III 
ba ketball and are led by AII-
American Center Mark Warren . 
The Triton played al State 
San Bernadino (17-4) on Janua ry 
29 and were beaten badly 89-64. 

Friday night's conte twas 
much more exciting than the 
fir t encounter between the two 
teams but the outcome was vir-
tually the same wi th the Tritons 
end ing up on the short end of a 
94-75 score. "They are a great 
team," said Coach Tom Mar-
shal!. "They should definitely 
represent the west in thc CAA 
Division III National Tourna-
ment.'" 

The Tritons fell behind early 
in the first half 29-17 and never 
got clo er tha n ni ne points 
throughout the rest of the game. 
The Coyotes full court man-lO-
man press seemed to frustrate 
the Triton ball handlers and 
cau ed many unnecessary turn-
over . 

With the Tritons dol'> n 45-26 
at the half, coach Marshall de-
cided to make a witch by starting 
fres hman guard Greg Pas kwietl 
in the econd half, putting an-
other three-point shooter on the 
Ooor. Paskwiet7 deli vered I'> hal 
was needed by hllting six three-
point field goals in the second 
hal f. Rob Rittger also hit five 
three-point field goals in the 
~econd half and finished the 
e\ening with six . Rittgers led all 
Triton scorers with 20 followed

Triton women 
fall short in 
comeback, 74-67 
By BRIAN ITOW 
Slll/f Writer 

Friday night's contest between 
the Tritons a nd the California 
State University San Bernardino 
Coyotes was a ynopsis of their 
season to date . All season long, 
the Tritons have been plagued by 
error-filled first halves which saw 
the team fall behind by a margin 
they couldn', surmount in second 
hatf comeback attempts. Their 
game with CSUSB was no dif-
ferent as the Tritons were unable 
to overcome an t 8 point halftime 
deficit, losing 74-67 . 

Ken Reinstein! Guardian 
Freshma n guard Greg Paskwietz (top left ) had six three-point field goals and junior guard Ro b Rittgers 
adde d fi ve more, but it was not enough to top CSU San Bernardino in the Tritons ' 94-75 loss. Below, the 
UCSD Pep Band performs for a packed house dur ing Friday's Spirit Night. 

Missed layups , poor hooting 
percentage (37 percent fietd goal 
shooting), turnovers and fouls 
plagued the team throughout the 
first half. The team had prob-
lem coping with the Coyote 
trapping defense , which forced 
the Tritons to commit II turn 
overs, take bad shots, and, at one 
point , held tflem scoreless for a 
span of eight minutes. In doing 
so , the Coyotes ran away with 
the game by the end of the first 
half and seemed as though they 
would never have to look back. 

Howe ver, after a Coyote 
basket extended the lead to 20 
points just after the half, the 
Tritons got hot with an 18-5 run 
cutting the CSUSB lead to seven 
points . Continuing to play good 
basketball , they cut further into 
the lead , trailing by only six 
points with 7:30 left to play. 
They were easily within striking 
distance and appeared ready to 
make that finat push to gain the 
lead. especially with three-point 
gunner Tracy Ragatz on the 
Ooor.

"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner" is the name given to approximately 
20 dinner parties being hosted simultaneously throughout San Diego 
on Sunday, February 28. These parties will give faculty, alumni, 
administrators, and students an opportunity to share experiences and 
concerns on an informal basis. 

The dinners are being sponsored by UCSD alumni, with the Oceanids 
and ASUCSD Auxiliary acting as co-sponsors. Approximately 250 
guests participating in the event will be divided into individual parties, 
each having a mix offaculty, alumni, staff, and students. Each party will 
reflect the entertaining style of its host. 

The event will be held on Sunday, February 28th at homes within 30 
minutes driving time of UCSD. Arrangements will be made for those 
students needing transportation. 

If you are interested in participating as a guest at one of these dinner 
parties, please sign up before February 12th in your Dean's or Resident 
Dean's office, the International Center or with Patty in the A.S . office. 
If you have any questions, please call the Alumni office at 534-3900. 

This is a great opportunity for us as students at this rapidly growing 
university to get to know orne of the faculty, alumni, and administrators 
in a less structured atmosphere. Please join us! 

Supported in part by ASVC D activity fees.

SPORTS 

Women 
Continued trom plge 12 
They built their lead up to 12 
points with one minute remain-
ing in the contest, 74-67. 

The Triton comeback attempt 
was led by Chris McCallum, 
who led the team with 21 points, 
and ancy Caparaz, who scored 
II points while dishing out five 
assists . They played better bas-
ketball in the second half yet -
as has happened many times this 
season - they could not keep 
their composure in the critical 
minutes of the game. 

"We're a young team with only 
one enior starter ... We haven't 
been able to pull out a close 

game yet. HopefullY, these games 
will help us down the road." 
Malone said . 

Friday night's loss marked the 
third time the Coyotes (16-3, 
ranked No. 4 in the Western 
Region) have beaten the Tritons 
this year. The Coyotes are look-
ing for a playoff berth but they 
could not pass the Tritons off as 
an easy win, even with an 18 
point halftime lead. Said CSUSB 
head coach JoAnne Bly, "We 
came out here looking for a win , 
I n our position, we need to win 
the rest of our games to make the 
playoffs. Even at halftime, we 
knew we couldn't let up because 
a game's never over when we 
come down here. UC D has a 
very tough team." 

Malone was disappointed with 
the loss , "This means we can't 
finish above .500," Malone said . 
"We made another valiant 
comeback attempt. Wejustcan't 
get over the hump." 

Despite the loss, Malone ha 
reason to smile over her team's 
performance. They played well 
in spurts, giving evidence to the 
way the team may be playing 
consistently a year from now. 
And Ragatz, the nation's leading 
three-point shooter for Division 
III women's basketball, con-
tinued to hit the shot at 50 per-
cent, making two of her four 
attempts. Now if they could only 
tie it all together and finish up a 
comeback. [Q] 

B-ball 
Continued from page 13 
on making the ational Tourn-
ament Marshall responded, " We 
still have a chance. We must win 
all of the remaining six games on 
our schedule and one of those 
games is against Division I oppo-
nent Southern Utah University." 
The Tritons are 13-7 and if they 
win all of their remaining games 
they will finish the season 19-7 
and could possibly receive an at-
large berth in the National Tourn-
ament. "We would like to get 19 
wins this season. Right now we're 
playing for pride, " Marshall 
commented. [Q] 

Love 
confession 

from an 
anthemaniac. 

As YOU know, anthe-
maniacs like myself 
just go crazy around 
flowers. So what does 
my Valentine send me 
on Valentine's Day? 
The FTD* Love Note 
Bouquet! 
Well , let me tell you, 

when I saw those 
beautiful flowers in 
that fine porcelain 
bowl it drove me wild. 

BeSides, this glOriOUS 
bouquet also came 
with a note pad and 
pencil with which I've 
written my Valentine 
every day. 
And smart Valentines 

know it doesn't cost 
much to send us 
anthemaniacs into 
this flower frenzy, 
Just ask your florist 
to have FTD send 
one for you.
