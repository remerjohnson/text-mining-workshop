A union representing student 
workers throughout the UC system 
has authorized its members to go on 
strike following a unionwide vote 
that passed with 96 percent support. 
United Auto Workers Local 2865 
includes 12,000 teaching assistants, 

graduate student teachers and readers 
who now have the authority to strike 
in protest of alleged intimidation tac-
tics used by the UC administration.

The vote comes a week after the 
union’s no-strike clause expired in 
its contracts with the University of 
California. UAW has expressed sup-
port for the American Federation 
of State, County and Municipal 

Employees 3299 workers, who plan 
to strike at UC campuses on Nov. 20. 
UAW may join them in solidarity.

UAW members claim that their 
annual pay, purportedly an average of 
$17,000, is not nearly enough to live 
on without taking a second or third 
job. Like AFSCME workers, UAW 
representatives believe that the UC

University of California undergraduate tuition may be frozen for the third consecutive year, according to a recent policy plan proposed by 
UC President Janet Napolitano.  

The plan was discussed at yesterday’s Board of 
Regents meeting in UCSF — if approved, it will 
keep the current undergraduate California resident 
tuition rate at $12,192 in annual systemwide fees.

In her first meeting with the Board of Regents 
this year, the newly appointed UC president 
explained that she hopes the proposed policy will 
provide enough time for administration to create a 
more sustainable and stable tuition setting for all 
UC campuses.

“We need to figure out, in the real world 
in which we live, how to bring clarity to, and 
reduce volatility in, the tuition-setting process,” 
Napolitano said in an address to the Board of 
Regents. “It’s time for the university to collabora-

tively come up with a better way.”
Napolitano mentioned the idea of “cohort 

tuition” — in which freshmen enter college with 
the expectation of a stable four-year tuition price 
— as a possibility for a new UC policy, although 
she also emphasized the need for the Regents to 
explore a variety of options. 

“We will also look at expanding our other 
revenue possibilities: grants, public-private part-
nerships, joint ventures, philanthropy,” Napolitano 
said. “These revenues must all be harnessed if we 
are to continue to be the world-class university we 
are, while being as low-cost as we can.”

While speaking about reasons for past tuition 
hikes, Napolitano cited overall economic difficulty 
and decreases in state funding and described the 
current importance of increasing cost-efficiency 
within the UC Office of the President. 

In addition to campus-wide cost of opera-

The UCSD San Diego 
Supercomputer Center created the 
Industry Partners Program last 
week, a collaboration between the 
center’s researchers and small busi-
nesses. The high-performance com-
puters, or “supercomputers,” offered 
by the SDSC are used by several 
tech-based companies in the San 
Diego area.

Built primarily for academic 
researchers, the SDSC rents out 
space on its large cluster computing 
systems to local businesses, which 
use the computing power for activ-
ities such as managing data and 
running simulations. According to 
the announcement, SDSC provides 
quarterly workshops, private meet-
ings with researchers and an annual 
review of recent research projects to 
members of the Industrial Partners 
Program. The center charges mem-
ber companies between $10,000 and 
$25,000 each year for these servic-
es. The pilot program held its first 
annual research review on June 12 
of this year.

The Supercomputer Center’s 
resources are used largely by manu-
facturers, who create intricate simu-
lations to test designs for their prod-
ucts. For instance Hunter Industries, 
a manufacturer of water-efficient 
irrigation products, has used the 
SDSC’s computers to update its line 
of sprinklers; the high-performance 
computers allow the company to 
simulate the movement of water 
through the sprinklers, aiding in the 
creation of a prototype.

Hunter Vice President of 
Marketing Gene Smith explained 
that his company would rely more 
on high-performance computers in 
the future.

“HPC [high-performance com-
puting] will certainly be a valuable 
tool for us going forward as we 
increase our reliance on CFD [com-
putational fluid dynamics] simula-
tion to reduce costs and time associ-
ated with prototyping and design,” 
Smith said in a UCSD News Center 
press release.

The services SDSC currently 
offers to small and medium-sized 
businesses have been made possible 
by the advent of cloud computing, 
which allows the Supercomputer 
Center to offer computing power 
on demand over the Internet. 
Traditionally, high-performance 
computers have only been accessible 
to large corporations, mainly in the 
automotive and aerospace indus-
tries, which have the resources to 
buy and maintain their own super-
computer units.

Americans may be exposed to an 
average of approximately 15.5 hours of 
traditional and digital media per per-
son per day by the year 2015, accord-
ing to a new report from San Diego 
Supercomputer Center researcher 
James E. Short.

In Short’s report, “How Much 
Media? 2013 Report on American 
Consumers” created in conjunction 
with University of Southern California 
Institute for Communications 
Technology Management, he examines 
how the relative growth and total vol-
ume of media changed from the years 
2008 to 2012 and the years beyond. 
According to his report, media con-
sumption grew at just over 5 percent 
a year, and, averaged across all media 
sources, media delivered in bytes 
grows at a rate of 18 percent per year. 

The report defines media con-
sumed as flow of data delivered to 
households and people. It does not 

account for multitasking and attention 
to or consumption of media. Media 
consumed at work such as using work 
email or taking notes in class is not 
included; the study focuses strictly 
on entertainment-orientated media 
including social media browsing.

“For me, it is important to know 
the volume of media that is delivered,” 
Short said. “[It is] important that peo-
ple know that this number [15.5 hours] 
is what you get if you add everything 
up — and it’ll go over 24 hours in a 
media day very soon.” 

By 2015, the report estimates that 
Americans will consume a total of 1.7 
trillion hours each year of traditional 
and digital media. That is equal to 
6.9 zettabytes — according to Short’s 
study, if 6.9 zettabytes of text were 
printed in books and stacked across 
the United States, including Alaska 
and Hawaii, the pile would be almost 
14 feet high.

The volume of media was exam-
ined through a baseline study of 30 

media types including satellite radio, 
tablet computers, smartphones and 
mobile video. The report takes data 
from public sources such as Neilson 
and ComScore, media company dis-
closures and analysts. Surprisingly, tra-
ditional media such as TV and radio 
remains responsible for the highest 
levels of daily media consumption, 
contributing 60 percent of the hours. 
Mobile computers are a growing sector 
— in 2008, it accounted for 3 percent 
of all bytes, which increased to 10 per-
cent in 2013.

The report says that the 15.5 hours 
is requested from media services and 
providers, but it does not mean that it 
is the amount of information a person 
actively attends to. The study indicates 
the growth in volume but not actual 
attention or comprehension of media. 

“The simplest example is when you 
go home and turn on the TV to watch 
a football game but walk out of the 
room,” Short said. “This means that 
what people are requesting and what is 

being delivered by providers is increas-
ing, but consumptive time is not. It 
is flat.”

Nearly two thirds of Americans’ daily routines may be spent interacting with digital media by 2020, the new study finds.



administration acted unlawfully when 
it asked union members if they were 
planning to go on strike.

The union published a report titled 
“Towards Mediocrity” that outlines 
how undergraduate and graduate suc-
cess is tied and how quality education 
depends on both.

“We are the front line teachers 
and researchers in the UC system 
[...] we have observed a decline in 
educational quality and accessibility 
at the UCs,” the report read. “When 
an introductory class in the sciences 
has 300 students and one Teaching 
Assistant, students struggle. So does 
the TA. Even heroics on the part of the 
teacher can’t keep 1/4 of the class from 
failing out.”

The UC system has been nego-

tiating contracts with several of the 
unions that represent its workers in 
addition to UAW, including AFSCME, 
University Professional and Technical 
Workers and the California Nurses 
Association.

According to UC officials, CNA 
will strike in conjunction with 
AFSCME this month. UPTE-CWA, 
which represents research and techni-
cal employees in the UC health sys-
tem, agreed not to participate in any 
strike activity and will instead return 
to contract negotiations. 

University of California Vice 
President for Systemwide Human 
Resources and Programs Dwaine 
Duckett released a statement on 
AFSCME’s planned strike.

“Given the hundreds of millions of 
dollars in state funding cuts UC has 
absorbed over the past five years, we 

must be fiscally prudent,” the state-
ment read. “University leaders have to 
be mindful that large, programmatic 
increases in pay and benefits for these 
workers drive up the cost of services 
they provide.”

UC officials believe that an 
increase in employee pay will inevita-
bly result in fee hikes for both students 
and patients across the system’s health 
centers. However, AFSCME alleges 
that students have already seen fee 
increases to offset six-figure salaries 
for the system’s top executives.

AFSCME’s last strike in May cost 
the UC system upwards of $20 mil-
lion, and a UAW strike could mean a 
major academic labor loss as TAs and 
readers go on strike.

To begin with, hat week was 
forgotten by all but three members 
of A.S. Council, whom I presume 
might have been dressed for the 
occasion by accident.

In similarly grim news, speakers 
during public input announced that 
campus service workers — including 
TAs — would be going on strike next 
week. Council was encouraged to 
join the strike in 
solidarity with 
the workers. The 
speakers’ appeal 
included prom-
ises of free pizza, 
the presence of a band, and Edna 
Montserrat’s claim that “It’s gonna be 
a really fun strike.” Fun is the point 
of striking, after all. 

In a special presentation from 
the Transportation Task Force that 
was established earlier this year, the 
results of the Keep it Moving, We 
Decide, Let’s Ride campaign survey 
were publicly presented to council.

“More than 60 percent marked 
either support or strongly support a 
fee referendum, and so that was sort 
of our go-ahead to continue with the 
referendum,” Revelle College Senator 
Soren Nelson said. “We’re confident 
that we have a lot of support behind 
the referendum.”

Although the details of the refer-
endum have not yet been finalized, 
council voted on a resolution simply 
declaring their support for moving 
ahead with the referendum. This led 
to an inevitable debate — not over 
the actual context of the referendum, 
but whether it was relevant or neces-
sary — but the resolution eventually 
passed 18-5-1.

Campuswide Senator Jordan 
Coburn recommended that a 
campus-wide email be sent out with 
the survey’s results and proposals, 
aiming to greater involve and inform 

students. While informing the stu-
dent body is important, it might be 
even more important not to overload 
them with far too many Listserv 
emails to delete.

AVP Concerts and Events Sarah 
Harley revved up excitement for 
this Friday’s Hullabaloo festival by 
announcing that the event will fea-
ture the first portable zip line to ever 

be present at UCSD. 
In other excit-

ing events, Sixth 
College Senator 
Allison Bagnol 
advertised for her 

event to support student education 
on fair trade; it includes free fair 
trade ice cream and bananas. Free 
food? Count me — and most other 
students — in. I wish I’d heard her 
say the date.

Revelle Senator Soren Nelson 
announced — again — that there 
are still no applications for the open 
position of Revelle College Senator. 
Best of luck filling the position. It’ll 
happen. If you’re reading this, apply. 
Please. Do it for council.

VP Finance Sean O’Neal tried 
to give $2,700 to PARSA, but, when 
asked what PARSA is, hesitantly 
said, “Well … they’re a student org 
on campus.” However, after a more 
eloquent description of the organi-
zation, which turned out to be the 
Persian Association for Rendering 
Science and Art, the motion was 
ultimately passed. 

Finally, council got excited 
for Campuswide Senator Jordan 
Coburn’s Nov. 20 event at The Loft 
featuring a panel of adult entertain-
ers. And, since this event begins at 
8 p.m. and council plans to attend, 
next week’s meeting will end at the 
blessed time of 7:55. Thank you, 
council, for the promise of a less-
than-two-hour-long meeting!

State of  California Plans to Increase Funding for UC System

tion reductions, Napolitano urged the 
state of California to actively par-
ticipate in stabilizing tuition rates, 
mentioning that such a partnership 
would be crucial in creating an effec-
tive tuition policy. 

“The State of California must do 
its part,” Napolitano said. “The uni-
versity needs additional funding for 

UC Retirement Plan and  enrollment 
growth.”

This increase in state funding for 
the 2014–15 university budget plan is 
set to be discussed at today’s Regents 
meeting, with a proposed $64.1 mil-
lion toward the UC Retirement Plan, 
$21.8 million for enrollment growth 
and $35 million for “reinvestment in 
academic quality,” according to the 
UC Regents Committee on Finance 

agenda. 
“The fight for low tuition — a 

hallmark of a public university — 
is something all of us have a stake 
in,” Napolitano said. “I know we can 
create the clear, predictable tuition 
policy our students and their families 
need and deserve.”

Take a 
Chance, 
and Go  
for a Pixie 

When a celebrity gets a haircut, it becomes front-page news on both 
sides of the Atlantic, and Yahoo 
News writers break their keyboards 
in excitement. Last week, “The 
Hunger Games” actress Jennifer 
Lawrence became the latest in a 
growing number of celebrities to 
go short and get a pixie. As much 
as I am loath to suggest following 
Hollywood trends, I wish more peo-
ple would similarly ditch what’s safe 
and comfortable and experiment 
with different hairstyles. If there’s 
ever a time to see if you can rock 
hot pink hair dye or a half-shaved 
head, it’s now, before you graduate 
and actually become accountable 
for looking like what the job market 
deems a respectable adult. 

According to health and beauty 
psychologist Vivian Diller, hair is 
one of the top three features — 
alongside height and weight — that 
people use to describe others and 
is prominently remembered after 
social interactions. 

Unlike other physical features, 
you can readily alter your hair 
through cutting, dyeing and high-
lighting and control its appearance 
through straightening, curling and 
styling. The way you present your 
hair immediately sends cues to 
others about your character and 
personality. Wealthy men during 
the American Colonial times wore 
white powdered wigs to project 
wisdom and sophistication. Diana 
Ross channeled disco diva with her 
voluminous ‘fro. Carrot Top would 
only seem half as neurotic without 
his bright-red, curly hair.

If you’ve been hiding behind 
the same curtain of hair since high 
school, consider trying a new look. 
Most women balk at the idea of ven-
turing outside of their comfort zones 
and shearing off all of their locks.

I took the plunge myself two 
summers ago on a whim, when I 
went in intending to get the usual 
noncommittal trim and ended up 
leaving eight inches on the salon 
floor. It was 105 degrees Fahrenheit 
that day, and I would have hon-
estly been happy going for a Sinead 
O’Connor.

At first I hated my new, chin-
length bob. I was convinced I 
looked like a boy. I would tug on 
the ends of my hair in a futile 
attempt to stimulate follicle growth. 
When I woke up in the mornings, 
I would look weirdly retro, because 
the ends of my hair would flip 
outward. I tried curling what hair I 
had left to see if it would look more 
presentable that way (it didn’t — 
instead of Flo, I looked like Shirley 
Temple). But I just had to give it 
some time: I started to appreciate 
not having the same mid-back-
length hair as every other girl, and 
I’ve kept my hair short to this day.

A little switcheroo won’t kill 
you, and you might even be pleas-
antly surprised by the results. For 
me, the next step might be trying 
cheetah print hair dye (just kid-
ding, I would be judged pretty 
hardcore at work). If you’re curi-
ous but afraid, make a change now 
as the weather gets colder — if 
the results are disastrous, you can 
always cower under a knit beanie 
for the next few months; everyone 
else will be none the wiser.

of the UC Board of Regents, the ASUCSD or the 
members of the Guardian staff. 

Though not endorsed by the Democratic Party, Fletcher 
offers promising plans for San Diego jobs and education.

For the second time this year, 
UC health and maintenance workers 
are going on strike after months of 
unsuccessful negotiations with UC 
administrators. The 24-hour strike 
to improve working conditions 
will be held on Nov. 20, includ-
ing a walkout and picketing at UC 
campuses and medical centers. 
Last May’s two-day walkout cost 
the UC health system an estimated 
$20 million, an amount we cannot 
spare again. This failure to agree has 
resulted in 96 percent of the union’s 
approximately 13,000 members vot-
ing to execute their last resort plan. 
Although discussions have been 
less than amicable on both sides, a 
decision needs to be made before 
students and patients of the medical 
centers take on the burden of the 
dispute and are hurt further.

Workers from the American 
Federation of State, County and 
Municipal Employees 3299 have 
spent the last year negotiating pen-

sion terms with the UC system. 
A UC administration mandated 
pension contribution increase of 
5 percent to 6.5 percent is leaving 
workers with a smaller take-home 
paycheck. The union has filed an 
official complaint with the Public 
Employment Relations Board claim-
ing that the UC system is using ille-
gal tactics, but PERB has not made 
a ruling on the matter. According to 
union president Kathryn Lybarger, 
the prevailing belief among union 
members is that after a year of 
respectful and thoughtful negotia-
tions, the UC system has resorted to 
“bullying” workers.

Like any large bureaucratic insti-
tution, the top-down hierarchy of 
the UC system often pushes those 
that are already at the bottom to the 
wayside whether they be students 
or low-wage workers. Although the 
typically apathetic student body 
may roll their eyes at another fight 
for funds, any disregard for the 

“invisible worker” may ultimately 
affect them, as any effort to com-
pensate for funding gaps may result 
in higher premium costs for stu-
dents enrolled in the Student Health 
Insurance Plan. It is not AFSCME 
that has predicted such an issue, but 
the UC system itself. According to a 
university statement, the UC system 
will not allow more fees to fall on 
students; although surprising, this 
is appreciated.

This strike comes at a politi-
cally advantageous time for the 
workers. With new UC President 
Janet Napolitano having only been 
in office for six weeks, workers are 
making their demands to a vulner-
able audience. Napolitano knows 
that she must swiftly react well to all 
requests as she is under the scrutiny 
of many skeptical constituents. 

AFSCME does not necessarily 
want such costs being pushed onto 
students, but an alternative funding 
source has not been clearly defined. 

An increase in SHIP premium costs 
is unacceptable given the already 
sorry financial state of the program. 
Following the bureaucratic suit of 
most UC issues, finances are steal-
ing the spotlight of this contentious 
debate but it’s the patients who will 
ultimately suffer.

In a game of “he said/she said” 
(read: white collar/blue collar), it’s 
difficult to determine who is in 
the right. We may not know who 
is right, but we know what is right. 
UC health and maintenance workers 
need appropriate retirement packag-
es, and the financial turmoil should 
not fall on students. Someone needs 
to take action prior to the costly 
Nov. 20 strike that will be hurt the 
university greatly. And of course, it 
is imperative that all parties involved 
keep patient care in sight. For a 
university that teaches such liberal 
concepts, it is hard to watch the uni-
versity system’s practice contradict 
what it preaches. 

W ith our endorsement for Democrat Nathan Fletcher as San Diego mayor, the Guardian Editorial Board is doing some-
thing we haven’t done in a long time — challeng-
ing the endorsement of the Democratic Party, 
which supports Fletcher’s fellow Democratic 
candidate David Alvarez.

The Nov. 19 Special Election for San Diego 
mayor finds San Diego’s Democratic Party in an 
interesting — and perhaps troubling — posi-
tion. When the non-partisan special election 
to replace sex scandal-plagued Democrat Bob 
Filner was announced this past August, Fletcher 
was presumed a de facto front-runner. But the 
Democratic Party endorsement of San Diego 
City Councilmember Alvarez in late September 
introduced a second strong Democratic candidate 
— and with him, the risk of splitting Democratic 
votes and handing the election over to Republican-
endorsed Kevin Faulconer.

Fletcher’s move to the Democratic Party on 
May 4 marked his second party switch in just 
over a year — he switched from Republican to 
Independent in March 2012, when the Republican 
endorsement went to Carl DeMaio. Because 
Fletcher is a newly minted Democrat, we can 
understand the motivation behind the Democratic 
Party’s decision to endorse Alvarez, a longtime 

registered Democrat who grew up in Barrio 
Logan and attended college at SDSU. Aesthetically, 
Alvarez is a candidate that the Democratic Party 
can safely present to its stable voter base, but 
Fletcher’s platform objectives better suit our — and 
San Diego’s — interests.

Fletcher’s education plan pushes the Science, 
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, or 
STEM, initiative, which aims to enforce education-
al programs in those areas. The focus on STEM 
makes sense for San Diego, whose rapidly grow-
ing technology sector provides an opportunity for 
schools in the area — UCSD included — to gain a 
competitive edge. 

And since Fletcher has close ties to tech industry 
leaders such as Qualcomm CEO and Jacobs School 
of Engineering namesake Irwin Jacobs, we expect 
that he’ll be able to make real headway in partner-
ing with businesses to advance STEM in schools. 
His other plans for San Diego prioritize job creation 
— he has pledged to bring 130,000 new jobs to San 
Diego by 2020 — and repairing city infrastructure 
to improve struggling neighborhoods. 

Alvarez’s education plan as mayor focuses 
mostly on bringing culture, arts and career edu-
cation to the K-12 system — a goal that, while 
admirable, does not capitalize on San Diego’s 
growing tech industry. Alvarez, born and raised

in Barrio Logan, has made waves on 
San Diego’s city council with his plan 
to revamp the historically troubled 
area by bringing in developers, mak-
ing divisions between residential 
and industry areas. Alvarez’s plan is 
ambitious, but it has faced criticism 
from opponents who say that it will 
push out, rather than support, low-
income communities in the area. 
Additionally, as only a third-year city 
councilmember, he lacks the track 
record that might otherwise show 
success in enacting his plans.

By contrast, Fletcher’s demon-
strated ability to “get things done” 
despite partisan differences has earned 
him the endorsements of Gov. Jerry 
Brown and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, 

both staunch Democrats who have 
been strong advocates for the UC sys-
tem. Brown authored Prop 30, which 
passed in November 2012 and hiked 
taxes on the rich, and prevented over 
$500 million in cuts to state colleges.

The point is that even though 
Fletcher hasn’t been a Democrat 
for long, his plans indicate a com-
mitment to values we can support. 
When we endorsed Democrat Bob 
Filner for San Diego mayor in 
November 2012, we called him the 
“lesser evil” against Republican Carl 
DeMaio. Filner got our endorse-
ment as the only candidate who 
supported the Prop 30 — and Carl 
DeMaio’s questionable economic 
plan pushed us over the edge. When 

Filner won the election, he became 
the first elected Democratic mayor 
San Diego had seen in 20 years since 
Democrat Maureen F. O’Connor was 
elected in 1992. Fletcher’s detractors 
anchor their complaints with the 
argument that Fletcher is a “flip-
flopper,” but these criticisms come 
out of a rather unwarranted fear that 
any candidate that isn’t party-bred 
cannot be trusted.

Though Democrats have been 
hesitant to embrace Fletcher, we 
don’t feel that his recent switch to 
the Democratic Party will marginal-
ize his efficacy. In fact, his transition 
assures us that he won’t merely serve 
as an institutional puppet for the 
party machine.

Dear Editor,
There are five women in this cafe. 

We probably have much in common, 
something to look forward to, stress, 
a hurt we wish would heal. The grim 
reality is that one of is also, statisti-
cally, the victim of a sexual assault.

According to a comment that 
ran in the Guardian, that person was 
probably lying. This is a demonstrably 
false claim that violates our Principles 
of Community and must be corrected.

The Department of Justice 
claims 20 to 25 percent of women 
will graduate having experienced a 
sexual assault. When our Principals 
of Community claim a commit-
ment to “decency toward all,” it is 
hypocritical, cruel, and unfair to 
print the false statistic that these 
women are probably lying. The 
citation used is an incorrect inter-
pretation of data originally printed 
in an online publication. Doing so 
invalidated and re-victimized our 
sexual assault victims by bringing 
their experiences into question for 
literally no reason at all.

“False Rape Accusations..,” 
by Wendy McElroy, appeared on 
FOXNews.com in 2006. McElroy 
is not a social scientist, which may 
explain her incorrect interpretation 
of a 1996 report by the National 
Institute for Justice. In her article, 
she claims that DNA evidence has 
invalidated 25 percent of rape accusa-
tions. It has not. It has invalidated 20 
percent of convictions referred to the 
FBI for reinvestigation.

The National Crime Victimization 
Survey tells us there are 237,868 
sexual assaults every year. 40 per-
cent are reported to the police, and 
3 percent of perpetrators serve jail 
time. The study McElroy references 
investigated convicted rapists from 

the “mid to late 1980s” which, let’s 
say, is a five-year period. If 3 percent 
of rapists are imprisoned each year, 
that’s 35,680 people. Of these, only 
10,000 were referred for reinvestiga-
tion. 2,000 were found to rule out the 
perpetrator based on DNA evidence. 
2,000 instances out of 35,680 is not 20 
percent. It is 5 percent.

In a five-year period, about 
1,189,340 people were sexually 
assaulted. Forty percent, or 475,736, 
reported the crime to police. Two 
thousand of these accusations were 
later overruled by new DNA evi-
dence, which is .4 percent of all rape 
accusations. In other words, of all 
the accusations of rape that were 
made in a five-year period, less than 
half of 1 percent were found false. 
The data McElroy uses to support 
her claim that false rape accusations 
are common not only fails to support 
her argument, it actually demon-
strates the opposite: DNA evidence 
shows no statistically significant rate 
of false rape accusations.

20 to 25 percent of women surviv-
ing sexual assault means, if you have 
four or five close female friends, you 
will know a survivor. While some may 
never tell anyone what happened to 
them, some survivors will. They may 
even tell you. If you are trusted with 
that information, remember that the 
NIJ found less than half of 1 percent 
of rape accusations to be false. Your 
friend is not lying. It is up to you to 
believe her.

The Good, 
the Bad and 
the Break-
Up Sex

D ear readers, I am sad to inform you that not all is well with your beloved columnist 
as of late. During this past month, 
I had to end my relationship with 
the person I have been dating for a 
while. Some of you may be famil-
iar with him because he has been 
mentioned a good couple of times 
in the history of this column, and 
mostly in a good way. Now, it was 
a thing that needed to be done 
because of lots of reasons no one 
has paid me to list, so we won’t go 
over those.

What we will go over, however, 
is breakup sex.

I’d like to start by saying that it’s 
not something for everyone. In fact, 
I’m pretty sure it’s not something 
that’s for me either, but maybe that 
will be something we can discuss 
next time around when I’ve ironed 
things out a bit more.

Anyway, there are people out 
there that will say breakup sex is 
the most “mind-blowing” sex you 
can have. (Why is good sex always 
called mind-blowing? I’m sorry, I’m 
irrationally angry.) This is an argu-
ment that has some merit. There 
are a lot of reasons people will tell 
you this. Now that the commitment 
is gone, so are any inhibitions you 
might have harbored. You’re finally 
free to be as crazy in bed as you can 
be because you no longer have to 
worry about scaring your partner 
away.

For me, I think the flare comes 
from the fact that both of you 
know that you’re moving on, and 
there’s a mutual understanding 
that since this is the final note, it 
has to be good. You want to go out 
with a bang — so to speak — not 
a squeak. And so, you pull out all 
the stops. Maybe there’s something 
to that no-more-inhibition thing 
after all. I also did a little research 
to see the man side of things, but 
I stopped when one of the reasons 
breakup sex was said to be awe-
some was because semen chemistry 
will change to cause spontaneous 
ovulation. Not once have I had my 
mind blown by ovulation, so that’s 
off the table.

 The thing is, for most people 
at least, breakup sex cannot remain 
all by itself in a vacuum of intense, 
uninhibited sensations. There are 
all kinds of emotions tangled up 
in there, for both people involved. 
Sure, you can tell yourself, “Of 
course I can do this no strings 
attached — I made my choice, and 
I’m sticking to it and this is just for 
fun!” But you probably won’t mean 
it. Unless you are far more badass 
than me — which is entirely pos-
sible because I am not very badass 
when it comes to being emotionally 
uninvolved — I’d say our attempt at 
fun was, at best, pretty misguided. 
It opened up a lot of issues that I 
had hoped had finally been closed 
and drew out the process of break-
ing up to even more painful levels.

 I guess what I’m getting at here 
is that I don’t recommend having 
breakup sex. Sure, it’ll be “mind-
blowing” (maybe), but all the lin-
gering doubts and all the questions 
it’ll raise for you afterward just 
aren’t worth it.

Pass on your typical cup of Starbucks and take 
a drive over to North Park’s Claire de Lune 
Coffee Lounge. Not only will they pump you 
full of jitter inducing espresso, they’ll also 
serve you a fat bagel sandwich. The breakfast 
bagel sandwich ($5.50) comes with a gener-

ous amount of egg and is topped with cheeses, tomato and onions. After 11 a.m., 
Claire de Lune switches from bagelwiches to regular sandwiches and freshly made 
soups — though it might be hard to think about an actual lunch when beautiful 
cheesecakes are staring back at you from inside Claire de Lune’s crystal case. 
Claire de Lune doesn’t just do coffee and food; it also showcases San Diego talents 
on the weekends. Recent performances have included ZZYMZZY Quartet and 
folk rock singer Whitney Steele. With a room full of leopard couches, Claire de 
Lune’s quirky, homey decor makes for an excellent study break. Grab some friends 
and give your study group a nicer view than Geisel’s gray tabletops. Heck, if you 
really fall in love with the place, you and your partner can one day get married at 
Claire de Lune’s indoor venue, the Sunset Temple.

When I hear about restaurants that 
call themselves vegetarian “with vegan 
options,” I imagine a measly three 
vegan entrees and terrible faux cheese. 

But at Ranchos Cocina, you’ll find that vegan-friendly “V” markings cover the 
menu. If you find your wallet near empty and your stomach grumbling, don’t 
fret: Ranchos Cocina makes three, huge, delicious pancakes that will fill you up 
for only $6. And while you’re waiting for them to arrive, you can snack compli-
mentary chips and salsa, made in house. Ranchos Cocina serves Mexican cuisine 
made traditionally and modified to suit vegetarian, gluten-free and vegan diets 
(there are vegan pancakes on the menu, too). Although Ranchos was busy, the 
surrounding customers and staff won’t bother you. Lighting that’s easy on the eyes 
and a friendly staff make Ranchos great for a lunch break when you can escape 
the dining halls on campus.

Off the Record isn’t a music place that 
just happens to have some vinyl, it’s a 
vinyl place that happens to have CDs. 

One thing we students seriously lack in La Jolla would be thrifty music shops. 
Luckily, Off the Record is only a short drive and can cure our cheap music 
withdrawals. Not only does Off the Record keep older music in stock from 
Iron Maiden to Janet Jackson, but also some of the CDs are priced as low as 
one dollar. Nothing feels better than finding a CD you’ve “needed” for years, 
but haven’t found at a good price. Don’t feel bad about spoiling yourself with 
Amy Winehouse’s “Lioness” because now you won’t have to keep it on a loop 
on Spotify. Not only is Off the Record great for a broke student’s wallet — in 
comparison to buying it from that wretched Amazon — but it also supports 
small, local businesses. Win-win situation.  

The only issue with Heaven Sent des-
serts is that their cupcakes are too 
pretty to eat. These are the cupcakes 
you skip lunch for because God only 
knows how many calories live inside 

them. They make the Chocolate Banana Cupcake ($3.50) with chocolate devil’s 
food cake filled with banana mousse with bananas inside and top it with a 
healthy amount of frosting. Their Chocolate Pumpkin Pie ($6.25) is a single 
serving of pumpkin pie with chocolate whip on top and a slab of thin chocolate 
– probably just to make it look artsy. I’m pretty sure everyone deserves to spend 
a fiver on a single cupcake, and Heaven Sent is the place to do it.

Nothing makes a person feel holier than buy-
ing fresh produce from local farmers. Plus, the 
North Park Farmers’ Market has fun specialty 

food vendors like Bitchin’ Sauce and their almond based sauces; or Baba 
Foods’ many different hummuses, like kalamata olive and pesto. Food wise, 
you can’t go wrong with PubCakes – beer plus cupcakes, really – or Pho 
Realz?! take on Southeast Asian street food. Chances are, if you’re craving 
it, then you can find it at North Park Farmers’ Market.   

Take a short drive off of 
University Avenue, and you’ll 
find Veg-N-Out, the “origi-
nal veggie burger spot.” Walk 

through the turquoise accented door and grab a menu, because you’re going to 
want to stay for lunch — or at least a bowl of their natural acai sorbet. Their menu 
is packed with creative burgers (made of plant proteins) like the Juanito ($9.25) 
with feta and jalapenos or the Western burger ($9.75) piled with onion rings. If 
you’re looking for something a lighter, then go for a sandwich. The Very Vegan 
is definitely enough for two because, while it might be a regular sized sandwich, 
it’s dense. Veg-N-Out makes the Very Vegan with Follow Your Heart cheeses (a 
vegan cheese alternative), vegenaise, avocado, tomato, sprouts, onions and — get 
this — apples. Take a walk down the veggie side and see all that it has to offer.

Sipz started out as a small coffee 
and boba place, and now is a must-
go for San Diegans, vegetarians and 
meat eaters alike. Sipz’s menu is huge 
and draws from Vietnamese, Thai, 

Chinese and Japanese cuisine, with dishes such as sweet-and-sour soup and 
vegan sushi. If you find yourself in need of a break, Sipz has happy hour all 
day on Tuesdays. Most appetizers are either $3 or $5, and all beer or house 
wines are $3. Don’t forget to grab a dessert. Spoil yourself and try the sweet 
rice with mango ($5.95).

WORLD TOUR

El Salvadoreno

BY NICHOLE PERRI STAFF WRITER
ILLUSTRATION BY JENNY PARK & LEO BUI

E l Salvadoreno, an authentic Salvadorian restaurant, is a pleasant surprise wrapped up in a tough exterior. It’s 
located in Grant Hill, a working-class neigh-
borhood near National City, and the outside 
of the restaurant looks more like an aban-
doned warehouse — complete with bars bar-
ricading the windows and doors — than the 
quaint, homey, family-owned atmosphere 
you’ll find inside.

The restaurant’s specialty is its pupusas 
($2.25), stuffed corn tortillas made with 
quesillo cheese that come filled with beans, 
meat and vegetables and topped with curtido 
(pickled cabbage). This dish is great for col-
lege students on a budget: It’s cheap, and it 
fills you up quickly. Meat lovers will enjoy 
the pupusas de chicharron (pork), or, if 
you’re vegetarian, try the pupusa y jalapeno 
or the pupusa y loroco (an edible flower 
stem). For dessert, the platano frito con 
crema ($4.50) — fried bananas covered in 
sugar, with a sour cream dip on the side — 
won’t disappoint.

The problem with many restaurant’s 
pupusas is that the food is either too greasy 
or not cooked long enough to melt the 
cheese. El Salvadoreno’s pupusas have a 
slight crunch on the outside and a gooey-
cheesy inside, minus the stomachache 
later in the day. Salvadorian food is heavy. 
Although the pupusas are good, and you’ll 
want to stuff your face, limit yourself to two 
or three, especially if you’re going to order 
dessert. The platano frito con crema comes 
with just three bananas cut in half and fried, 
but what the dish lacks in quantity, it makes 
up for in denseness.

The ensalada (pineapple juice and fruit 
chunks) and the horchata salvadorena are 
great drinks, so don’t waste your time with 
water. If you get the horchata, be warned 
that Salvadoran horchata isn’t the watery, 
and over-sweetened Mexican horchata 
that most San Diegans are familiar with. 
Salvadoran horchata is thick, grainy and 
delicately sweet.

When you enter the restaurant, you 

might not be greeted or seated right away, 
as the restaurant has a small staff. If you’re

N ew York City-based singer-songwriter-producer Devonté “Dev” Hynes is a chameleon.
He started off in 2004 as a mem-

ber of the noisy post-punk group Test 
Icicles but soon transformed into the 
adorably bespectacled troubadour 
of his melody-driven folk project, 
Lightspeed Champion. Shortly there-
after, Hynes decided to change direc-
tion once more, revealing the hipper 

Blood Orange sound rooted in indie 
R&B with a lush pop sensibility. This 
constant metamorphosis has made 
Hynes one to keep an eye on.

A follow-up to the 2011 Blood 
Orange LP “Coastal Grooves,” his 
sophomore release, “Cupid Deluxe,” 
bears many sonic similarities with 
the previous album. The avant-
garde hooks, dreamy vocal layers, 
warped synthesizers and funky beats 

recall the standout tracks “Sutphin 
Boulevard” and “Champagne 
Coast” from the first album. (In a 
tongue-in-cheek throwback, “Time 
Will Tell” even mimics the line 
“Come into My Bedroom” from 
“Champagne Coast.”) However, 
“Cupid Deluxe” showcases a higher 
level of precision and expertise from 
Hynes, making it feel more substan-
tial. Perhaps out of all of his previous 
musical phases, this is the one he 
feels the most comfortable with.

The excellent opening track 
“Chamakay” is a duet with Caroline 
Polachek of Chairlift. It bridges the 
gap between a subtly sexy, indie-funk 
sigh and a sweet pop lamentation 
of heartache. Complimenting the 
synthesizer echoes and soft drums is 
something that sounds like marimba 
(or “a giant kalimba,” as suggested 
by Rolling Stone). An unpredictable 
saxophone adorns the instrumental 
break, teasing the listener with its 

smoky, retro sound. The melange of 
Hynes’ and Polachek’s harmonies is 
feather-light, complimenting each 
other beautifully. “You’re Not Good 
Enough,” featuring Samantha Urbani 
of Friends, puts forth the catchi-
est chorus on the album. The track 
features a smooth nouveau 80s 
production as an homage to an era 
of glistening pop songs, funky bass 
licks and groovy rhythms, bearing 
similarities to Hynes’ recent produc-
tion work with Solange (“Losing 
You”) and Sky Ferreira (“Everything 
Is Embarrassing”). “No Right Thing,” 
a collaboration with Dave Longstreth 
of Dirty Projectors, is another stand-
out track. Heavy on soulful vocals 
and stuttering guitar licks in the 
verses, the song propels itself forward 
in a lush arrangement in the chorus, 
demonstrating a skillful interplay 
between major and minor melodies.

In a video biography posted on 
his YouTube page, Hynes states that 

his primary position is to create 
music for others. Although he pos-
sesses impressive versatility, it is dif-
ficult to overlook the fact that he is 
strongest in collaboration with other 
artists on “Cupid Deluxe.” He is 
certainly successful with this album 
because he is able to evoke sounds 
of the past — traces of the soulful 
groove of Michael Jackson, the ner-
vous energy of the Talking Heads 
and the colorful pop of Madonna 
— while still making them sound 
new and fresh. “Cupid Deluxe” can 
thus be regarded as a throwback that 
is both contemporary and forward-
thinking. However, the solo tracks 
feel somewhat disjointed and lack 
the precision and refinement of his 
previous production work and col-
laborative efforts.

T he San Diego Asian Film Festival hosts a great many interesting and power-ful films from directors across the world — Thailand, Hong Kong, Japan, the Philippines, even Iran. But sometimes it hosts films from much closer to home: 
Nearly a decade ago, San Diego-based Wong Fu Productions premiered their first 
feature film at this very festival. An online video production company, Wong Fu has 
produced dozens of videos and even a couple of feature films through the partnership 
of three men: Wesley Chan, Ted Fu and Philip Wang. The studio started right here at 
UCSD when the trio met as undergraduates during a video production class. Years 
later, and with many successful projects under their belt, the trio came back to campus 
for the San Diego Asian Film Festival. We sat down with them and asked them a few 
questions.

Guardian: You three have very much operated outside of the traditional, stereotypical 
norm of Hollywood and American filmmaking in general. Do you all feel that this was 
just a method of operating that worked for your situation, or is this the beginning of a 
new standard in filmmaking?
Ted Fu: I think filmmaking is about pushing the envelope, finding new ways to 
describe something, finding different ways to tell a story. Filmmaking, for the most 
part, runs parallel with technology and innovation.  YouTube, or online streaming, is 
one of those innovations that caught on; it works well and is accessible to millions of 
people and, for the most part, free.
Philip Wang: I think at the beginning we really had no idea what online video was; 
we just knew that it was the only way we could get our work out there. Technically, we 
started making videos before YouTube was even around. We had our own website, and 
we bought bandwidth, and we uploaded our stuff to a server, and people had to down-
load it. When YouTube came along we just thought: “Oh wow, free bandwidth.” And 
then it just so happened that community was forming, and people were finding us pri-
marily through YouTube first. And now, it’s grown to be like the norm for consuming 
media throughout someone’s day, and I think that’s why it’s become this new direction 
of where filmmaking and creating content is going. We were just early adopters out of 
necessity; now we kind of see that, yes, this is the future.
Wesley Chan: I think ... a new standard was developing, and that’s why streaming 
video was just beginning to get really big and popular. And also, the technology like 
smaller cameras, affordable cameras, equipment that was leveling the playing field for 
a lot of student filmmakers, amateur filmmakers ... was becoming available to every-
one.

G: In the past, you had some trouble with the idea that a film starring a male Asian 
lead wouldn’t be profitable. Have you run into this attitude elsewhere? How do you 
respond to people that hold that attitude?
PW: I think an Asian male lead now can be much more accepted than it was even 

three to four years ago. If you just look at media now and what’s on TV and the num-
ber of Asian roles and how Asians are portrayed, [it] is much more positive than it 
was. There’s a lot more opportunities — because we kind of say “being Asian is kind of 
cool now,” and that hasn’t been a concept that we haven’t heard in a while.
WC: In terms of mainstream Hollywood, there’s still a long ways to go for any Asian 
— the work is tough out there in the mainstream. But technology has created niche 
markets, and it’s allowed people to find what they want to support, and it’s allowed the 
creators to find an audience. So now we have an audience that’s very open to us and 
wants us to have Asian leads, and so now we can say, “Yeah, we’re going to make a 
movie that has that, and we don’t have to abide by the rules of mainstream necessarily” 
like we did with “Sleep Shift,” when someone else was producing it. Now we’re going 
to produce it ourselves; we’re going to make those decisions — and I think this is the 
beginning of a future of that happening more often — as more filmmakers and more 
creative people are going into places of power, we can basically call the shots that we 
want.
PW: We try to diversify the stories that we have, and […] we want to work with people 
that have a similar attitude as us [who] just want to tell a good story and be colorblind 
to the characters.

G: You’ve returned to UCSD for a homecoming during this year’s San Diego Asian 
Film Festival. Your first major, feature-length film debuted here seven years ago. That’s 
almost a decade. Would your younger selves at that festival have believed you if you 
told them where you’d be now?
TF:  My younger self would quickly move on to more important questions after he 
realized that I’m from the future: He’ll probably ask me what stocks to invest in and if I 
remember any lottery numbers. Come to think of it, I think I’m going to try to memo-
rize at least one jackpot number in the event this happens one day.
PW: It’s been a long time since our first submission to the SDAFF, and it played a 
huge part in our development, and it was a huge stepping-stone for us. I think if my 
younger self [was] to hear where we are now, it’d just be like, “Good job, you’ve kept it 
going, and you’ve grown.”
WC: Yeah, we’ve never been comfortable with where we are. Even now, wherever we’re 
at, whatever “success” we’ve achieved, we’re still not comfortable, and we want to move 
forward. So hopefully there’s a seven-years-older version of us that’s asking, “Are you 
proud of where we took you guys in seven years?” and hopefully we can be proud of 
them, too. But I think it’s awesome that we get to come back to really the place where 
it all began, and I remember going to that first festival and sitting at that table and 
watching the awards being given out and thinking “wow” — it’s pretty crazy, for sure.
PW: It’s been a very long and exciting journey, and we’re happy that we’ve had our sup-
porters and our fans — to even say that we have fans is still weird to me now — but to 
say that we were on this journey with them is something that I’m really happy about.

C onsidering Cormac McCarthy’s fame following the success of 2007’s “No 
Country For Old Men,” com-
parisons will inevitably be drawn 
between it and “The Counselor,” 
McCarthy’s first proper screen-
play. And why shouldn’t it? Both 
films focus on a mysterious cast 
of characters circling a drug deal 
gone wrong, somewhere along the 
Mexico-U.S. border. Unfortunately, 
any similarity in quality that might 
be expected stops short at the films’ 
general subject matter.

Regular ranchers and drug 
dealers are abandoned in this film. 
Instead, the mystery and half-
revealed details center on a cast of 
characters seemingly drawn from a 
melodramatic action blockbuster, 
most of them rich and petty drug 
lords enjoying a lavish lifestyle that 

includes Bentleys and pet cheetahs.
Into this world steps the myste-

rious “counselor,” played with quiet 
confidence by the excellent Michael 
Fassbender. With his new wife 
(Penelope Cruz) in hand, he dips 
his feet deeper into the drug trade 
to give her a better life. Predictably, 
as he awaits his plans to come to 
fruition, he is betrayed by a myste-
rious acquaintance. The counselor’s 
position as middleman for an 
unseen — yet omnipresent — drug 
cartel puts him in a dangerous 
position as they come seeking ret-
ribution.

The cartel is the overwhelm-
ingly evil presence that lurks right 
around the corner, paralleling 
Anton Chigurgh in “No Country 
for Old Men.” But because the 
cartel is a mostly off-screen entity, 
viewers aren’t drawn into the dry 

and dangerous landscape the film 
depicts. Instead, we wait patiently 
for the danger to arrive.

Consequently, the plot can be 
summed up as one hour of talking 
and half-veiled threats, followed by 
another hour of slow degeneration 
into bloody chaos. It’s a thriller 
with no riveting drama or narra-
tive, lacking a hook or a payoff. The 
only thrilling thing this film has 
going for it is an innovatively grue-
some execution and a bizarre sex 
scene involving just Cameron Diaz 
and the windshield of a Ferrari.

The main weakness of “The 
Counselor” is crystallized in a scene 
towards the end of the movie. With 
the death toll rising, a new character 
drops in to deliver a monologue about 
the medieval poet Antonio Machado, 
who was willing to sacrifice all his 
talent for just one more hour with his 
deceased lover. It’s a beautifully writ-
ten scene, but with no proper plot and 
character development leading up to 
it, we simply aren’t invested enough to 
care. “The Counselor” is strewn with 
scenes like this one, which appear 
grandiose and deep on paper, but 
feel hopelessly out of place on film. 
Whereas McCarthy’s trademark has 
always been his bleak and post-mod-
ern view of the Western genre, here he 
has apparently abandoned any attempt 
to string a proper plot together, and 
instead spent many dialogue-heavy 
scenes waxing philosophical to an 
uncaring audience. As such, “The 
Counselor” feels more like a postmod-
ern theatre than Western.

This lack of immersion is only 
exacerbated by lines of dialogue 
that seem to be written directly 
for the audience as commentary, 
rather than for characters interact-
ing with each other. Not even Javier 
Bardem’s role as a drug dealer with 
spiked-back hair and gaudy sun-
glasses can bring enough charisma 
to the dialogue to make it work.

Worst of all is that the most 
terrible lines are delivered by 
Cameron Diaz. As an actress not 
particularly well-suited for seri-
ous drama, she sorely sticks out 
here against the performances 
by Fassbender, Bardem and Brad 
Pitt. She orates her lines meant to 
underscore the Darwinistic struggle 
surrounding her with such sopho-
moric emphasis that it feels like one 
is watching a high school produc-
tion of Shakespeare, not a film by 
some of the most renowned talent 
in the business today.

It’s uncertain whether the blame 
ultimately lies with a shoddy script 
by McCarthy, since this is his first 
foray into scriptwriting, or with 
poor execution from Ridley Scott, 
whose recent track record hasn’t 
been too stellar (see “Prometheus”). 
Suffice to say, if you’re a fan of 
either, simply stay home. This is 
“No Country for Old Men” with the 
thrill replaced by a bloated sense of 
self-importance.

Imagine being paid to live in a mansion and throw the most insane house parties imaginable. 
That’s how “Workaholics” star Adam 
Devine felt when Comedy Central 
gave him the opportunity to launch 
his new show, “Adam Devine’s House 
Party.” The show takes place inside 
the house, and each episode features a 
house party with an outdoor standup 
comedy act. The series shows college 
students that they haven’t truly partied 
until they’ve been to parties like these.

Guardian: How do you feel to have 
your own show for the first time?
Adam Devine: You know it’s a sur-
real experience, a show with my name 
on it!

G: Congratulations! Do you miss hav-
ing [“Workaholics” co-stars] Blake 
Anderson and Anders Holm on the 
set with you, and should we expect to 

see them make appearances through-
out the show?
AD: A little bit. They make cameos 
in the show, but it’s really a separate 
project. I didn’t want it to be behind-
the-scenes “Workaholics,” but rather 
highlight up-and-coming standup 
comedians. 

G: So do you have any real house 
party stories of your own that perhaps 
inspired the plot?
AD: Oh, yes. For the filming of 
“Workaholics,” Blake and I actually 
lived in the house that the show was 
filmed, which was a blast. One time, 
Blake jumped off the roof during a 
party and broke his back. That was 
pretty hilarious.
 
G: Tell us a little more about the for-
mat of your show, as it has a mix of 
party scenes and on- stage stand up 
performances.

AD: I thought that it would be a really 
cool idea for the audience to get to 
know and see a lot of these comedians 
on and off the stage. They get to know 
the comedians just outside of their 
performance at a giant house party. 
It provides a story for the standup 
within the context of giant house par-
ties and shows they are more than just 
people who can stand in front of a 
microphone and tell jokes. 

G: Do you have any last words you 
want to leave us with?
AD: I love to party — spread the 
gospel!
 
Be sure to check out “Adam Devine’s 
House Party,” airing Thursdays at 
12:30 a.m. on Comedy Central.

A fter directing, producing and self-distributing his award-winning debut “BANG 
BANG,” UCSD alumnus Byron 
Q developed a close friendship 
with Tiny Raskal Gang member 
Vanna Fut. Fut’s life story became 
the focus of Byron’s latest effort, 
a documentary entitled “Raskal 
Love,” which was featured at the 
San Diego Film Festival.

Guardian: What drew you to 
Vanna’s story?
Byron Q: Just the struggles he had 
to go through at such an early age 
and still having, you know — if you 
meet him, he’s the most humble 
person you’ll ever meet and just 
very genuine and very loyal and 
very committed to what he’s doing. 
When I grew up, I also was raised 
by a single mom and shared that 
type of family environment of 
a broken family. So a lot of that 
also drew me towards the story. 
Something I could relate to.

G: You introduce the film with the 
line, “Get ready for a true story.” 

Why do you feel it’s important to 
tell true stories or stories rooted in 
reality?
BQ: There’s a greater amount of 
illusion to truth with the coming 
of reality TV; most of it’s false and 
really fabricated, but it’s given to 
you in form of truth. And I think 
the media, too — you know, when 
you watch news and read articles, 
everything has a false spin to it. 
I’m not saying this documentary 
doesn’t have its own objective or 
point of view, but that’s kind of the 
whole exploration of this project — 
a search for truth and a search for 
something that’s authentic.

G: What does the term “Raskal 
Love” mean to you?
BQ: “Raskal Love” basically means 
just brotherly love and family. I 
think that’s something I got through 
making the documentary, and that’s 
something that’s actually a real term 
that the TRG [Tiny Raskal Gang] 
members use. It’s not something 
that I just came up with for this; it’s 
something that had already been 
there. They take that as when some-

body shows up at your doorstep, you 
take care of them. You do whatever 
it takes. You give them food, house, 
protect them — what it really comes 
down to is family.

G: What do you want people to take 
away from “Raskal Love”?
BQ: My idea for “Raskal Love” and 
what I want people to get out of it is 
a different perspective on the whole 
gang culture. I think we’ve seen the 
portrayal of gangs as something 
negative — all gangs are just bad and 
just violent. But our society is based 
on gangs. The gang is a family, so to 
destroy gangs is to destroy the concept 
of family. Our society, the govern-
ment, the CIA, organizations: All of it 
is based around a gang essentially. The 
idea of a gang as a family — [Vanna] 
wanted to use that to empower [the 
members] in a positive way, like, 
“Why don’t we help each other, help 
members of the community, as a gang, 
as a group, as a family.”

L ibrary Walk pisses me off on a whole other level, and I avoid it at all costs, with only two nota-
ble exceptions. One, I occasionally feel 
like taking surprise selfies with the 
crazed Christians; two, I am regularly 
in the mood to watch someone fall 
to their death from one of those tiny 
Penny skateboards. Like, if you’re 
going to live by a stupid trend, I may 
as well get to watch you die by it. At 
least the people who choose scooters 
as their mode of transportation know 
they aren’t cool.

Anyway, Library Walk. Given 
how decentralized UCSD is, Library 
Walk is essential in providing it with 
some unity. I do love Library Walk in 
principle, yet the trek through it on 
a busy day is just too horrifying. My 
friends tell me that “The LW” is one 
of the best parts of our university. But 
if I’m here for one purpose, it’s to take 
a dump on everything you love. And 
that’s exactly why I am giving it the 
Triton Side-Eye. 

We are meant to be enriched by 
all the activities and groups making 
themselves known, but I feel like a 
character on “The Walking Dead” 
whose storyline is about to be cut 
short. The heartbeat of our campus is 
too busy pumping out cheap cupcakes 
and frat events to keep us alive. Every 
organization understands how the 
space works, and they all aim to use 
it in exactly the same way — white 
noise. Methinks there is little coin-
cidence in this behavior happening 
next to the commercial entity of our 
campus. The treats may sell, but the 
ideas don’t.

The environment of Library Walk 
is a concerted effort to erase unique-
ness in the name of superficial togeth-
erness, despite UCSD’s six-colleges 
inviting us to embrace individuality. If 
I can see that through my gin-slash-
lemon-slash-olive oil-slash-gin cleanse 
induced stupor, so can you. We are 
lucky we don’t study somewhere that 
defines school spirit with face paint 
— we aren’t six years old. The center-
piece of student traffic deserves to be 
a stage for specific groups and interest 
to shine instead of assimilating into a 
meaningless block of nothingness.

Occasionally, Library Walk does us 
right. During one week each year, it 
converts into a positive display about 
the Israeli/Palestine conflict. Speaking 
of attempted cleanses, I’m now being 
told that while this gin is lifting my 
mood, I have apparently mistaken 
“jam” for “gin” and that it was meant 
for topical application (explains why 
I’m not getting the glow I was prom-
ised...whatever). 

When we are lucky to have some-
thing great, there is invariably going 
to be some other all-to-typical display 
distracting from the magic: groups 
that can only entice with free food, a 
hoard of homosexuals crying out for 
people to “Hug a Gay Person,” as if let-
ting people know it’s safe to touch us 
is an effective form of activism. Quick 
side note that hugs are a real problem 
on Library Walk. I couldn’t even reg-
ister to vote last week without being 
accosted with free hugs and biblical 
hymns. A bit much, to be honest. 

My point: Library Walk is gener-
ally an instrument to overbear us with 
strategic mass appeal. It all seems 
rather empty for what many consider 
the heart of our campus. It plays into 
what I see every day: thousands of 
people who seem hell bent on present-
ing themselves to the world by slip-
ping into the anonymity of UGGs and 
a sweatshirt. If the place we traverse 
most can’t live us out of that, then the 
UGGs have won, god dammit.

Psychic Christmas Party!!!- Hi, Whether it 
is family, the holiday in general or past 
Christmas delights or disappointments, 
tonight we will work Christmas energy. We 
will do healings, mini-readings and look how 
naughty (forget the nice! - lol) you’ve been. 
For those interested, there will be a secret 
Santa (this is a bad place to try and keep 
secrets) gift exchange. Anywhere between 
$10 and $20 for the gift should be good. 
Plans are to eat, drink and be merry starting 
at 7:30PM. Class starts at 6PM and the party 
at 7:30PM. Ideally you bring a Secret Santa 
gift, $20 for the class and something edible/
drinkable to share. D.R will play Clairvoyant 
Santa and everyone will get an energy gift 
during the night. Since it will likely be cold 
and we will need to be exclusively inside, let’s 
cap the party at 26 people. Happy Holidays!

the All-CCAA first team honors, and 
Cohen also won the CCAA Best 
Defensive Player of the Year award. 
Senior Taylor Wirth, who sustained 
an ankle injury that may see him 
sidelined for the remainder of the 
postseason, was named to the All-
CCAA second team. Pascale was 
awarded the CCAA Coach of the 
Year for the second consecutive sea-
son.

“It felt pretty special to win it,” 
Pascale said. “There are a lot of great 

coaches in the league, and being rec-
ognized by them felt great.”

This Thursday, if No. 3 Chico 
State wins, UCSD will face the 
Wildcats for the fourth time this 
season. The Tritons are 2–1 with 
Chico State, and Pascale said that 
the two teams match up against one 
another well.

“We like that matchup,” Arsht said 
of a potential bout between the two 
CCAA powerhouses. “They definite-
ly like to bang around the field a lot 
and have a lot of heavy hitters, but 
I think we can definitely hang with 

them.” 
Of course, if Seattle Pacific bests 

Chico State Thursday, the Tritons will 
go up against a school they haven’t 
faced since their 2007 season.  
Given either scenario, Pascale is con-
fident that the Tritons will perform.

“I told all my guys to make sure 
they leave their mark on the pro-
gram,” Pascale said. “I think they’ve 
done that, but I don’t think this team 
is done yet.”

with me.”
The sophomore computer science 

major has recorded some solid times 
this season — placing 20th at the con-
ference championships and 22nd at 
the Annual Triton Classic — nothing 
that would indicate Alwafai would be 
the first Triton to run amongst the 
top in the nation in five seasons. To 
the casual observer, Alwafai’s qualify-
ing time may have come as a bit of a 
shock but not to UCSD head coach 
Nate Garcia, who said Alwafai’s hard 
work is finally paying off.

“Alwafai’s done a real nice job 
of adapting to the collegiate train-
ing regimen,” Garcia said. “He had 
a good year last year and continued 
to work over last summer. He’s just 
started to develop and mature as an 
athlete, and he’s put in a whole lot of 
hard work.”

Come Nov. 23, Alwafai will be 
back on the Plantes Ferry Sports 
Complex course in Spokane, which 
Alwafai said should work in his favor. 
“I’m really comfortable at the course 
up in Washington,” Alwafai said. “It’s 

a pretty straight course — not a lot 
of hills or turns, just pretty much flat 
grass land. It’s solid and fast, which 
I like.”

Running without teammates — 
in an individual sport where run-
ning alongside confederates can be 
a huge advantage — may set Alwafai 
back. But Garcia said one of Alwafai’s 
strengths is his ability to pick a pack.

“He’s the type of guy who is able 
to put himself into a fast moving pack 
and manage that stressful environ-
ment well — to take anxiety and turn 
it into motivation,” Garcia said.

Alwafai said he hasn’t considered 
tactics just yet, but that he plans to 
try and stay close with his CCAA 
conference opponents from Cal Poly 
Pomona — a squad that just edged 
the Tritons in the conference cham-
pionships. 

Alwafai will be flying back up to 
Spokane, Wash. next Saturday. The 
course will be open for practice Nov. 
21 and Nov. 22 before the Nov. 23 
meet at 11:30 a.m.

March. “The positives are that we 
have a little bit of succe ss to build 
off of in this long winter we have 
coming up,” Attaran said. “We 
can build on our fitness and get 
some of the new guys on board to 

carry through to the race season in 
March.”

While the Tritons will not row 
again until March 1, at their next 
event in Long Beach, they have little 
plans on slowing their roll.     

“Our team goal this year is to 
make the national championships 

and to do better than we have done,” 
Johnson said. “We really need to 
focus on not just winning but mak-
ing sure we’re fast enough to com-
pete at the highest level.”

Next week, sophomore Tareq 
Alwafai will return to Spokane, 
Wash. — the site of his 14th place 
finish at the West Regionals — to 
compete in the NCAA national meet.

The first Triton to qualify for 
Nationals since 2008, Alwafai fin-
ished the 10,000-meter course last 
week in a program record time of 
32:27. Placing 14th overall, the soph-
omore was one of just 40 individual 
runners to be selected from across 
the country to compete in the nation-
al meet next Saturday, Nov. 23.

The UCSD men’s cross country 
team — placing sixth in a field of 
18 teams — was just 18 points shy 
of qualifying for the NCAA meet as 
a team. 

“I was really excited to hear that 

I’d be going out to Spokane again,” 
Alwafai said. “But it is a real bum-
mer that my teammates, who have 
helped me out all season and helped 
get me to Nationals, won’t be coming 

I t was announced last Monday, Nov. 11, that the UCSD men’s soccer team would live to play another game.After falling to Cal State Los Angeles in the California Collegiate Athletic Association cham-
pionships last week, the Tritons earned their first bid to the NCAA Division II national tourna-
ment since 2003. UCSD will go into the regional with the No. 2 seed, behind No. 1 seed Cal 
State Los Angeles and in front of No. 3 Chico State. 

Beginning this Thursday, the Tritons will host the NCAA playoffs for the first time in 
program history, when No. 3 Chico State will face No. 6 Seattle Pacific. 

UCSD will play the winner between Chico State and Seattle Pacific this Saturday at 7 
p.m. at RIMAC field.

“We’re definitely excited to be going to the tournament and even more excited that 
we’re hosting,” senior defender Alec Arsht said. “I think there’s definitely a bit of a bit-
ter taste in our mouths after losing to Cal State Los Angeles — we thought we definitely 
dominated the game, but hopefully, that’ll just motivate us more this weekend.”

UCSD took on Chico State in the semifinal, beating the Wildcats 2–1 on an overtime 
golden goal by freshman Malek Bashti. The goal was Bashti’s first of the season and came 
just one week after he was sent to the hospital for a cardiac arrhythmia.

“What a moment for Malek, to score his first goal on a game-winner in overtime,” 
head coach Jon Pascale said. “It was great to see that kind of swing for Malek; I couldn’t 
be prouder.”

On Sunday, UCSD fell to No. 1 seed Cal State Los Angeles 1–0, in a game 
where Pascale said the Tritons dominated the opening half and 
Arsht said UCSD was the better team. 

“The first half of the final was probably the best we played 
all year. Unfortunately, we put one just wide,” Pascale said. 
“In the second half, the game was a bit more even, and they 
capitalized on an opportunity to late, but I still thought it was 
some of the best soccer I’ve seen all season.”

Five Tritons earned All-CCAA honors this season.

The UCSD men’s and women’s 
crew teams continued into their sec-
ond and final event of preseason 
competition at the San Diego Fall 
Classic, held this past Sunday at 
Mission Bay. 

 The Tritons competed against 
rowing squads from Arizona 
State University, San Diego State 
University, the University of San 
Diego, UC Davis and UC Santa 
Barbara. 

The Triton men dominated 
throughout the day, taking first 
place in both events they rowed in, 
while the UCSD women had a more 
difficult time in its home port.

In the Men’s Open 8+ race, the 
Varsity 8 squad claimed victory with 
a time of 14:58. The Triton Junior 
Varsity 8 team placed a respectable 
fourth, clocking in at 15:57 and 

ahead of UC Davis’s Varsity group 
(16:16). In the Men’s Open Novice 
8+ race, the Triton men won handily 
with a time of 15:44, well ahead of 
fellow competing squads.

“The idea for us is to win every 
time we go out, and we did that,” 
UCSD men’s head coach Zach 
Johnson said. “Especially consider-
ing we started a month later than 
the teams that we were competing 
against, it’s a good sign.” 

While the Triton men felt satis-
fied with their performances this 
Sunday, they know much work has 
to be done beyond these victories. 

“Results really weren’t that para-
mount,” senior Zack Attaran said. 
“Obviously we wanted to win and 
we did that. It was more like a good 
finish to the fall season, and we 
have things to look forward to and 
work on.” 

While UCSD’s men’s crew teams 

found success at Sunday’s Fall 
Classic, the Triton women struggled 
more throughout the day. 

In the Women’s Open 8+ event, 
the Triton A team finished ninth 
with a time of 18:31. Behind them, 
the Triton B team placed 11th 
(18:55), while the Triton C team 
placed 14th (20:19). The Women’s 
Open 4+ race provided little con-
solation, as UCSD’s A team, led by 
senior captain Olivia Knizek, placed 
10th (21:27), and the C team fol-
lowed soon after in 13th.

However, in the Women’s Open 
Novice 8+, the Tritons rowed well, 
finishing in third with a time of 
19:20, behind USD (18:01) and 
SDSU (18:30). 

The Fall Classic marks the end of 
the fall preseason schedule. Neither 
team will return to the water until
