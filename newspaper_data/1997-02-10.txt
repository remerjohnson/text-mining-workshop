Also important is the mainte-

The UCSD Guardian 

We're all obviously 
much happier now 
than were the 
students 
unfortunate enough 
to aHend UCSD 
when the golden 
nectar flowed freely 
In the dorms. 
spent in class - something they 
would not want and would actively 
avoid. 

Additionally, attracting quality 
fac ulty would surely be a problem. 
How could we rec ruit and main-
tain a world-cl ass, intellectu all y 
superior faculty under those con-
ditions? 

Everyone knows that professors 
of any merit ba~e their decisions on 
where to teach in large measure 
upon campus alcohol policy. Surely 
they conSider th is more important 

The real problem 
isn't with the dry-
campus policy; It's 
with the onerous 
drinking age in this 
country. 

CO llccrn ~ about academi cs 
aside, wou ld the socia l scene real-
ly be beller orr i r RAs and deans 
total ly ig nored the alcohol si tua-
tIOn? I' ll ad mit th at I'm not cra/.y 
about part ies at whidl alcohol is 
the central att raction. I don' t like 
to play dri nk ing games, and I 
espec iall y do nol like talking to 

than such banalities as salary, ben-
efits or ability to gain tenure. If 
UCSD returned to allowing stu -
dents to drink in their dorm rooms, 
we would bleed out our intellectual 
reserves as professors ned in 
drove~ to more responsible institu -
tions. 

Finally, though UCSD is cur-
rentl y drawing from among the 
best and brightest of California's 
tudents, a~ well as highly qualified 

indiv iduals from around the coun-
try and around the world , they are 
cert ainly not bright enough to be 
all owed to make their own deci-
sions concerning whether to con-
sume alcoholic be verages. These 
young adult s need the superi or 
guidance of the administration so 
as to ensure that they make the cor-
rect choices. 

Even though underclassmen arc 
lega ll y adult s in every other 
respect, they are obviously neither 
mature enough nor responsi ble 
enough to decide whether to have a 

drunk people. I suspect that many 
peuple at UC D arc the same way. 

0, I don' t mean hori ng. I mean 
people who can recog ni ze th at 
drinki ng so lely because they like 
waking up in the morn ing in pools 
of their own vomit is an insane 
waste of time and energy. 

Losing control because you've 
had 100 much 10 drink is a da nger-
ous propos it ion . Although you 
won't hear about it on the news 
every night, drunk drive rs ki ll and 
maim people every day. And every 
day, people who have had too much 
to drin k end up havi ng unprotected 
sex with people they hardly know

preference for the president or the 
United State, and be tried as adults 
and put into adult jailS; although 
they are considered savvy enough 
that the IRS and state franchi se tax 
board hold Ihem li able to decipher 
tax forms and hold them re ponsi-

they can be drafted into the armed

nevertheless incapable of mak ing

UCSD's dry-campus po licy was 
a tremendous innovation that, as 
anyone can plai nl y sec, had a huge 
pos iti ve effec t on our li ves as 
UCSD students. I shudder to imag-

me in th is, fair reader - what 
UCSD would be like had the cur-
rent alcohol poli cy not gone into

Whi le the dry-campus p licy 
might not be the ideal :,itualion, it

practicable course for the uni versity

THE 
EDITOR'S 
SOAPBOX 

Laura Knighten 
Copy EdHor 

This tory began la~t year with my 
desire to rent a movie - a task that I 
J idn' t anticipate would be diffi cult. 
H,IVi ng a driver's license, car keys and 
enough money to pay for a movie, I 
journeyed to the nearest video store to 
accomplish my mission. 

"Excuse me.. . excuse me," I 
said several ti mes to the woman 
behind the counter. Fi nal ly turn ing 
around, she grected me wit h an ai r 
of general annoyance. 

"Can I help you," she said -
not a, ked - in a lOne resonant 
with a lat:k uf interest. 

I wa~ in Ihe process uf te ll ing 
her that I was i nt e re~ t cd in 
obtaining a renta l card when she 
curt ly interrupted wi th , "You have 
to be I g:' Bei ng well over I!L I told 
her that was fine and asked aga in 
how to get a card . 

Shc then bega n to laugh -
heavi ly. Actually, she cack led. 

"You don't look 18 - not even 
dose." she somehow managed to 
say in between laugh,. 

Not onl y docs th is woma n 
demonstrate poor customer-service 
skills, hUI her alt it ude relkcts the 
lack of respect wi tn which ma ny 
young adu Its are trea ted. 

The woman could have simply 
asked for ident i lication, or at l ea~ t 
lOlled her e~lckle dow n to a ~nicker, 
instead of making me feel small 
and ridic ulous. However, for this 
woman, Illy apparent age scrvcJ as 
an excuse to be rude. 

Chances are, ~ he would never 
have treated any other "adult " 
customer, such as the two wo men 
standing immediately behind me in 
li ne, ill the same manner. Those 
two customers did in fac t receive 
her friendliest greeting and most 
efli ciclll service. 

My escapade in the video store 
is one of many such examples I 
ha ve encountered. I've bee n 
ignored, pat roni zed and even 
fo lluwed arou nd ~ to res for no other 
reason ext:ept that 1'111 yo un g. 
Mayhe it is the hlonde hai r and 
freckles that gi ve me slich a 
menacing appcarance . 

As angry as the~e particu lar 
~ i t uat ions ll1a~e me. they arc 
~Y lll pt o matit: of a larger i~ sue - the 
double standard Amenca has I<lr its 
young adults. Th" country demands 
fu ll service from young adults, but 
rcl'lIsc~ to grant them l11an) of the 

frccd()l11~ and pri vi leges that shuu Id 
accompany aJulthooJ. 

A~ a per!>oll owr the age or 18 
hutunucr 2 1, I have been gl\ cn the

leaders and tbelr deCisions wit h tax 
do ll ars from Illy ml!age r student 
income. At the same time, I am 
sumehuw not re,ponsi ble enough 
to legally consume alcoho l. 

My purpose in ra i ~ ing thi ' 
example is not to argue fo r a 
change in the lega l drinking age-
that's another column . Rather, I 
think this situation illuslrates well

A Look At UCSD's 
History Reveals 

That Alcohol 
Policy Doesn't 

Necessarily 
Restrict Use 

Almost everyone knows what they' re 
gClli ng thclllsc! ves into when they go off 
to co llege. Whi Ie it's defi nilC ly a time for 
learning and growing as an indi vidual, 
it 's also a time for lelling off steam, 

ce lebrating newfound freedoms and 
discovering that scenes fro m "Animal 
House" rea lly aren 't all that far from 
reality. 

Drinking and partying - like it or 
not - arc an int egral part college life. 
For most students, it 's a great lime - one 
they' ll never forgel. However, for some 

student~ und administrators a lcohol usc is 
an issue of concern . 

As incoming freshmen, one of the 
first things UCSD students learn is the 
campus alcohol poli cy: If you ' re under 
21 years of age, you arc not permillcd 
to possess or consume alcohol. Period. 
It 's a rule we all know we ll ami one we 
all follow - ri ght? 

What many don't rcali/.e is th at 
this policy was efrected as recently a, 
1985 , when the uni versilY 
adm ini strati on decided to make 
UCSD what is cO lllmonl y referred to 
m, a ·'dry campus." Alcohol fl owed 
freely on campus pri or to 19115, 
when fralernity parties - compkte 
with kegs ~ were often held in the 
old gy mnasium. 

Upon reviewing a camrus study 
conducted by the Alcohol and 
Substance Ahuse Comm ittee 
(ASAC), Vice Chance llor of 
Undergraduate Affai rs Joseph 
Watson decidcd to revise the 

residence-hull po licy in winter of 
1985 so that alcohol consumption 

in public place - namely, ~ uit es anJ 
dormitory areas would be 

prohibited. 
Possession of alcohol by ludents 

under the age of 2 1 would be punished. 
Funhermore, po session of kegs and other 
large quantities of alcohol could be 
punished by eviction from the Re idential 
Halls and terminal ion of residential

Too much alcohol on a

problems in a student 's life. 

'1'he altitudes and dnnking 
practices of people around you 
have a lut to do with if you decide 
to drink. how much you decide to 
drink and how concerned you arc 
when you drink ." Marl: Schuck it , 

profes~o r of psychi tltry at the 
UCSD Medical School and 
re. carder of alcoholism at the 

Vcteran~ Affairs Medical Center, 
said. "Peer innucnce has a lot to 
do wi th i I' you get yoursclf 
exposed to a ~ituatlon where 
problems might develop." 

Schuckit conducts an ongc)lng 
research project that , tudies the 

va riou~ effecb of alcohol on 453 
male college students het ween the 
ages of I H anti 25. 

He di vided alcohol -re lat ed 
problems into two ca tegories -
alcohol abu~e and alcohol 
dependence. According to 
Schuck it , akohol abuse - an 
excessi ve usc of alcohol for 
reasuns other than "partying" -
may involvc fcw prohlem" while 
alcohol ' depcndence i neludes 
"pretty pervasive prohlems." 

According to Schuckit. sure 
signs of alcohol dependence 
i 111.:1 ude three predominant 
indicators: a family history of 
alcoholism. a low leve l of 

the 

response to a Icohol and cenain 
personality variations. 

"You have a three to fourfold 
chance of alcoholism if you have 
an alcoholic parent." he said. '1'en 
years later you' II have a 60 percent 
chance of being an alcoholic." 

Schuckit sa id that a low level 
of response - meaning. an 
amount of consumption that 
would have previou~ly created a 
high or a ··buLl" docs not 
anymore - is an indicator of 
aka hoI dependence. 

,vfherc arc actually a series of

Schuckit said that 10 to 15 
percent of all male UCSD student, 
meet the criteria for alcohol abu,"e 
or dependence. He urged these 
individuals to seek help . 

"If you continue to drink at all. 
I' m sure you'll control for a period 
of lime. and I'm sure there will 
times when you stop." Schuckit 
said . "But in the long run. you're

headed for trouble." 
What should these individual s 

do if they can admit they might 
have a problem? Or even if they ' re 
not sure? Schudit offered five 
,o lutions: 

o Call the ,lti onal Council on 
Alcoholism and ask to speak to a 
volu nteer. A,k them what klild of 
resou rce, arc ava ilable to you . 

o Call and ge t information on 
AII.:oholi cs Anonymous. You don ' t

o Talk to an RA or House

• Go to Studcnt Health 
Services. Programs can assist 
individuals with all.:ohol and drug 
problems. If you refer yourse lf. 

c o

your confidentiality is guarantecd. 
• Consult a doctor or clergy 

member. 
(n spite of thi s. nol all drinking 

is bad. Medical evidence supports 
the fact that contro lled drinking is 
even beneficial to health . 

"One to two drinks a day _ 
never more - seems to be 
associated with lower ri sks of 
some kinds of strokes." Schuckit 
said. "One or two drinks for 
so meone who doesn ' t have a 
rea on why they shouldn ' t be 
dnnking probably stimulates the 
appetite a tad . and probably makes 
one feel more gregariou~ . So there 
arc some benefits. bUI they are 
greatly outweighed if you're a 
recovering alcoholic - in which 
case. you ~houldn' t drink at all." 

Is a co llege atmosphere likely 
to induce akohol-related 
problems'! According to Schuckit. 
the answcr i~ most likely no. 

", The fac torsl arc no different 
than the factors that contribute to 
cveryone else. Therc's no reason 
to think that college students are 
different in any way." he said. 

Dany l y~ hyn -Adams agreed. 
"We're just a cross-secti on of 

the real world." ~he said. "Wc're 
hoping to do ~o me educati onal 
thing~ - tryi ng to bring responsible 
drinking into the eyes of students." 

There's no rca~()n to think that 
co llege cquab beer. but akohol 
seems to he plentiful. So what is the 

bc~t recommendation for studenls? 
"Be responsible." Hutchison 

said. "And be smart."

Young adults victims

Continued from page 7 
the gap in which young adults live. We 
are caught somewhere between 
adolescence and adulthood - nOI 
quite young enough to get away with 
being irresponsible, but not old enough 
to recei ve the respect given to adults. 

When does one beco me and 
adult anyway? Eighteen is uch an 
arbitrary number. Seeing as he or 

~he has probably never met me. 
how docs so me legislator in a 
distant capital know at which point 
I suddenly become mature enough 
to drive a car. vote or drink? 

The fact is that no such magical 
age ex ists because everyone 
reaches maturity at a different rate. 
Some people never do get there. 

For thc sake of a safe society. 
limits must be imposed somewhere. 
We don ' l want 10-year-olds driving 
cars. for exa mple. However. those 
limits should be consistent. 

There are laws thai protect older 
people from "ageism" 
discrimination on the basis or their 
age. Young adu lts can be affectcd 
by agei~m as easi ly as older adults. 
While I'm not asking for 
legis lation preventing store clerks 
from heing rude, the laws that 
already ex ist shouldn 't enforce a 
ridi culous double standard. 

On the most basic level. what I 
am really asking for is respect. Just 
bec,lUse I am young does not mean 
that I am ignorant, irrespon ible or 
a thief. Treat me like an individual.

UCSD Puts a Major Scare Into Bruins 
UPSET·MINDED: Facing the defending national champions, the Tritons play some of their best volleyball to steal a game 
By Steve Walsh 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

One word can be used to describe the play 
of the men 's volleyball team at RIMAC on 
Saturday night: inspired. 

Facing the defending Division ( National 
Championsanda lineupstackcd 
with two All-Americans and a 

Ifi~~1 player-of-the-year candidate. the Tritons gave the Bruins of UCLA allthat they could handle 
in a fast-paced. aggressive rour-
game match th at had the UCSD 
faithful thinking upset until the 
final spike fell. 

------ Carrying the swagger of a 
national powerhou e and apparently believ-
ing that their Division III opponents would 
just roll over because of the UCLA prestige. 
the Bruins opened the match with the major-
ity of their regular staners on the bench. But 
rolling over and playing dead was the last 
thing on the minds of thc Tritons a' they 
stormed out to a 5-2 lead to open the fi rst 
gallle. 

Sensing that they may have underesti -
mated their opposition. the Bruins used a 
timeout to settle themselves and rall y back 10 
take the lead. 8-5. 

To break the UCLA momentum. Triton 
Head Coach Duncan McFarland call cd a 
timeout of his ow n and the team responded by

tying the score. The two squads traded points 
back and forth with UCSD using hustle a~d 
hean to make up for what it lacked in size. But 
the Triton rally was not be enough. as the 
Bruins used theirenormou frontline. includ-
ing a 6-foot -1 0 middle blocker. to take the 
first game. 15-11. 

With the home crowd sensing that their 
team was able to eompete against their more 
prestigous guests. the Tritons took the court 
for the second game with an intensity thaI 
has only been seen in flashes so far this 
season. 

" It makes it so much easicr for our guys to 
play well when the crowd secms like they arc 
enjoying their effort on the court," McFarland 
said. 

Taking advantage of a number of UCLA 
hitting errors and a steady offense set. UCSD 
jumped out to a 10-6 lead. Looking to close 
out the game. McFarland went to hi s bench to 
servi ng eXLraordinaire Kurt Seckington. who 
promptly served three straight points for the 
Tritons. 

With UCSD two points away from scaling 
a Will in game two. Junior oppositc hitter Jon 
Yarri s came up with the play of the match. As 
the two teams rall ied forthe point. Yarris took 
a set from Satao Minami and blasted it ofT the 
head of the Bruins middle blocker. The hall 
thcn traveled over 25 feet in the air to the 
rafters of RIMAC before coming down and

Associatwn 

being hit out of bounds by UCLA. That point 
put the finishing touches on a game the Tri -
tons won. 15-9. 

Looking to extinguish any hopes of an 
upset. the Bruin coaching staff opened the 
third game with their nonnal starting lineup. 
Led by 6-foot -7 player of the year candidate 
Paul Nihipali , UCLA flexed its muscle and 
showed its height in taking the game. 15-7. 

The fourth game saw UCSD play with all 
of the guts and hustle that it had. Strong 
swings from both Yarris and senior Eric Mai 
and big blocks from Guy Mount and Matt 
Minehan kept UCSD close as the game wore 
on. A big kill by Yarris put thc Tritons wi th in 
one point and forced a UCLA timeout and a 
Minehan stuff block tied the score at 12-12. 
But the dreams of an upset would nOI become 
a realit y as the Bruins closed out the game and 
the match wi th three straight points. 

"Wo:.·re definitely thinking about upsct-
ting one of these Itop Division (I teams." 
Mcr<lrland said. "We've kind of gOllen past 
the point where we arc happy jusl to take a 
gam!! off of one ofthcm. Now we're thinking 
' Iet s go for Ihe who lc thing· ... 

With a win on Friday night against Wilfrid 
Laurier Universi ty (CAN) and strong play 
against U LA. the Tritons arc beginning to 
play some of their best volleyball and will get 
a chance to test their newfound chemistry on 
Wednesday as they face USC at RIMAC. 

Claire Schneider/Guardian 
Yeah : John Yarris gets vertical for one of 
his 25 kills against the Bruins of UCLA.

HardbaUers Earn Split in LA Women Continue 
Western Domination FIRSTS: Traveling to CSULA for a doubleheader, UCSD notched its first 

win of the year before losing the nightcap to the Golden Eagles 
EPEE: The UCSD women fencers remained 
undefeated last weekend at Pasadena 'By Travis Hil l 

Staff Wmer 
Experience I'> an invaluable WOl-

modlly III the ~portlng world, e~pe ­
cla ily in ba~eba ll. No other ~ P()rt has 

lI10re nuan<.;e~. no 
other SpOrl is so de-
pendent on the little 
thllig" Thousands of 
mind ga mes are 
played on every pitch: 
the pilcher dueling 
wi th the hitter. the 
r:ilc her baiting the 

umpire, the lirst baseman working 
on the haserunner, the managers an-
ticipallng each other. It 's amazing. 
Many"experls agree: the more expe-
rience, the better. This year how-

eyer,ayouthful U SDba,ebaliteam 
is attcmpting to dispel that philoso-
phy. How? With sheer talent. 

The Tritons are very young thi s 
season, with only onc senior, Dave 
Yerman, on the ro~ter. Their pitching 
staff IS very inexperienced. David 
Takehara is the only returning hurk:r 
from last year's rotation. So without 
the opti on of rdying un veteran crafti -
ness, Head Coach Rohen FlI:tcher is 
counting on a bevy of live anm. 

Last Saturday, he got hIS first 
glimpse of a very bright future. The 
Tntons traveled to SU Los Ange-
b for a douhleheader, and spilt it. 
They won the fir~ t game 9-5. and 
lost the second 10-5. 

Junior Matt Li vingston started 

the fir, t game. and pitched ex tremely 
well in deliven ng six \eorcle~s in-
nings. The Triton ofTense re, pondcd 
to this opportunity and scored nine 
run s 10 the first six innlllgs. After 
Livingston w,,~ relieveu, the Triton 
hullpen was knocked around for five 
run s, but fre~hman Yos hayah 
Goldfarb came in and do~ed the 
door for the vi t: tory . LefHielucr 
George E,canul!las led the offense, 
going lhree for four with three R Bh. 

While the Tritons did lo~e the ~ec­
ond game, there IS Mill M)IllC expcn -
mcntlOg going on with the pitching 
\taff. Eventually the Tritons will have 
asct rotation and they Will scule down 
into a rh ythm. Then the future star, 
will get a chance to ~hine.

Sometimes, it's tough to be the 
best. Especially when the best are 
epee fencers on the same squad. 
UCSD's problem of having Janet 
Wert/ , SUl.annc Walters and 
Jea nie Rockway is one 
many West Coast squads 
would love to have, but the 
Tritons alone face thi s di-
lemma. 

The UCSD women re-
mained unbeaten 10 confer-
ence play last weekend at 
Pa sadena, trouncing CLA. USC 
and UCS B to improve to 6-0 on 
the ~easo n . Junior epee spccialiM 
Wertt remained undefeated on the 
season, improving her rec ord to 
24-0. Walters has mirrored her per-
formance by also notching a record 
o f 24-0. Rockway follows elme 
behind with a 22-2 record. 

In the women 's foil, Caprice 
Robert s and Hannah Griffith 

handled the Bruins, Trojans and 
Gouchos to seeure thc women's 
overall victory. 

" 'rene Chen, one of our 
younger fencers, had an out,tanu-
ing perfurmance, " Coach Mike 

Aiau said. "Everyone i~ 
gearing up for the NCAA 
We stern Regi o nal s in 
March and our last confer-
ence meet in two wccks in 
Los Angeles." 

The men wou Id nut be 
denied either, los ing only to 
UCLA's epee squau. Tim 

Marsh led the way for the Tri tons 
in the epee serie s. while Matt 
Soskinscharged ahead in the men 's 
sabre events. 

ow that the season is wind -
ing down, the women and Illen 
willluok to au vance in the indi -
v idual eve nts at the Western 
Regionals in March. hoping to 
co mpcte at the NCAA ational 
Championships.

"I inlormed thclll that I wa\n' t

prcgame. 

Wh~lte"er she did say, it wo rk ed

Regals have a ve ry good squad. 
But the Tntons ca me out finng In 
thc rirst hall and the Regab nc ver 
saw what hit them. It was some of 
thc bcst baskethallthc Tritons have 
played thi ::. cason. 

Their defenSive game plan was 
exceuted perfect Iy: They douhle-
teamed thc powerful Rega l post 

·players, and lorced thel r poor out -

shot!> . The Trttons ow ncd thc 
boa rds, and turned turno ve rs Into 

tramltlon pOints . 
The u~ual halanced-motion 01'-
fcn~e had great ball movement and 
every time down the lIoor It \eemed 
that a different Tfllon was scor-

half, UCSD was leading 49-
24. 

In the !>econd half, the 
Tnton::. conllnued to play 
well. They ~Iowcd uown the 
pace a Itttlc , bu t they al -

game and were never threa t-

In what was !> uppo~ed to 
be a tough game, C D turned It 
into a 34- polnt druhbing and 
Malone was oncc again happy.

The Tritons arc not in a confer-

always a mystery. The Tritons have 
made the playoffs the previous two 
seasons with I H-6 records. 

Right now the Triton!> are 14-5 
with some very difficult games 
rcmaining. The glaring contests 
arc at ri va l Poi nt Loma and at home 
aga i nst Chapman . These games are 
must-wi ns for the Tritons if they 
arc to sceure a playoff spot.
