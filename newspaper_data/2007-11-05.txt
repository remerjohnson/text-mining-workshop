The A.S. Council is conducting 
interviews this week to select a candi-
date for the vacant position of associate 
vice president of student services. A 
panel of councilmembers is expected 
to announce its final choice from the 
applicant pool on Nov. 6, and the coun-
cil will vote on the matter next week. 

Associate Vice President of Finance 
and Resources Sarah Chang said the 
position has remained open so far 
because no qualified candidate was 
available last quarter.

“[Last year’s applicants] weren’t 
quite up to caliber, so I reopened the 
position,” Chang said.

The appointee will be expected to 
act as a liaison between the council 
and its services, which include Student-
Run Television, the student-oper-

Both directions of traffic on the I-5 freeway were shut down for several hours on Nov. 2, as police searched for a pipe bomb intended for the Vista courthouse.

Pipe Bomb Scare Shuts Down I-5

By Gina McGalliard
Contributing Writer

The Nov. 2 closure of Interstate 
5 due to a pipe bomb placed on the 
La Jolla-area freeway forced a tem-
porary shutdown of the bridge on 
Voigt Drive, as well as led to several 
shuttle routes being rerouted for 
approximately two hours.

The explosive device, found in 
a backpack, was planted slightly 
north of the La Jolla Village Drive 
exit near the UCSD campus. The 
California Highway Patrol initially 
shut down only one lane and a num-
ber of ramps, but later decided to 
shut down a six-mile stretch of I-5 
in both directions, from Highway 52 
to the I-5/I-805 merge.

The maker of the device, 46-year-
old Michael Buffalo of Oceanside, 
had told police the bomb’s location 
earlier in the day. Police said Buffalo 
had originally planned to detonate

STUDENTS
LOBBY FOR INPUT 
IN SEARCH FOR  
UC PRESIDENT

By Reza Farazmand
Senior Staff Writer

In a move to increase student 
involvement in the ongoing search for 
a new UC president, the UC Student 
Association requested last week that 
the UC Office of the President allow 
student representatives to meet with 
all presidential nominees before a 
final decision is made. The request 
comes on the heels of a decision 
by the Board of Regents to limit 
the Student Advisory Committee’s 
future involvement in the search 
process to only one meeting with 
the final presidential nominee, citing 
concerns of confidentiality.

As outlined in the Regents’ Policy 
on Appointment of the President of 
the University, a number of constitu-
ent groups within the university are 
able to participate in the search via 
the formation of special advisory 
committees. Policy dictates that each 
of these committees is given time 
to meet with the final nominee or 
nominees at the search period’s con-
clusion. 

The Student Advisory Committee 
was notified in September that this 
policy would mean that its subse-

One month after a lawsuit accusing 
the University of California of religious 
discrimination was supposed to begin 
trial proceedings, the  case remains on 
hold while the judge continues to pore 
over the high volume of material.

The Association of Christian 
Schools International, Calvary Chapel 
Christian Schools of Murrieta, Calif. 
and six students within the district 
are suing the UC system for discrimi-
natory admissions practices, alleging 
that the university’s rejection of reli-
gion-based course proposals to meet 
science, history and English entrance 
requirements demonstrates prejudice 
against Christian schools and stu-
dents. Federal Judge S. James Otero 
rejected a university-filed motion 
to drop a majority of the charges in 
August 2006, and the suit was finally 
scheduled to go to trial Sept. 24.

ACSI officials said that the UC sys-
tem rejected several proposed courses 
as a part of the necessary “a-g” sub-
ject area admissions requirements, a 
decision that unfairly limits certain 
students who choose to take religion 
courses from meeting the necessary 
application requirements, thus pro-
moting a “secular viewpoint.”

The university, however, claims 
that as long as the core academic 
content is present, the addition of a 
religious viewpoint does not preclude 
a course from meeting requirements 
and being approved.

“The plaintiffs claim that UC 

admission discriminates and recent 
UC rejection of primary texts for their 
‘a-g’ subject requirement courses have 
violated the right to free speech and 
religion,” UC counsel Christopher Patti 
said. “Reviewers and faculty review 
the textbooks for content students 
need. Textbooks must meet academic 
requirements, so that students receive 
training or skills necessary for success 
in their first year at the university.”

Friction between the university and 
Christian groups was first brought to 
light in 2004, when the UC Board of 
Admissions and Relations with Schools 
refused to grant “a-g” credit for classes 
taught with certain religious-themed 
books. Among the rejected texts were 
biology and physics textbooks pub-
lished by Bob Jones University Press 
and A Beka Book, publishers whose 
writings have been accused of favoring 
religious teachings over scientific fact.

The introduction to Bob Jones’ 
“Biology for Christian Schools,” one 
of the disputed texts, states that the 
authors have attempted to “put the 
Word of God first and science second.” 
“Government for Christian Schools,” 
a textbook used at Calvary Chapel, 
attributes the forces of governmental 
decay to “man’s sinfulness.”

Calvary Chapel administrators did 
not respond to repeated requests for 
comment.

ACSI advocates argued that if 
courses with a Christian perspective 
were not approved, neither should 
courses such as “Western Civilization: 
The Jewish Experience.” UC officials, 
however, have said that the aforemen-

tioned course was approved because 
it fulfills the necessary academic cri-
teria.

Aside from taking 14 approved 
“a-g” courses, students still have sev-
eral ways of satisfying the admission 
requirements of the 10 UC campuses. 
Students can be admitted if they score 
in the top two-thirds on the SAT II 
subject tests of the missing course’s 
corresponding subject, or by scor-
ing a cumulative 3450 on the SAT 
Reasoning Test and two SAT II subject 
tests.

More than 40 other courses 
at Calvary Chapel schools, includ-
ing some science classes, have been 
approved to meet “a-g” requirements.

 Bus Route 
Change a 

Headache for 
Commuters

By Connie Shieh
Staff Writer

After a summer meeting where 
La Jolla residents shared their griev-
ances about public transportation, the 
Metropolitan Transit System recently 
altered the 48 and 49 bus routes, elimi-
nating service to areas adjacent to Via 
Mallorca, Via Alicante and Gilman 
Drive behind La Jolla Village Square. 
However, many UCSD students have 
expressed frustration with the deci-
sion to cut off service to the heavily 
populated area. 

The route was altered after a June 
hearing, which determined that MTS 
would increase the bus system’s opera-
tional efficiency by cutting out a por-
tion of the route that it deemed inef-
fective and unnecessary. At the same 
meeting, many La Jolla homeowners 
complained that students frequently 
loitered near bus stops in residential 
areas, creating a significant problem 
in their area.

Many of the students who live in 
housing complexes like Archstone 
and Apartments on the Square are 
now forced to take the Nobel shuttle

Study Links TV to Blood 
Pressure in Obese Kids
A new study on childhood obe-

sity, led by UCSD researchers, 
shows that watching too much TV 
may lead to high blood pressure 
in overweight children.  

Perrie Pardee and Jeffrey 
Schwimmer, M.D., researchers 
from the pediatrics department 
at UCSD, advise parents to fol-
low recommendations from the 
American Academy of Pediatrics, 
limiting television to two hours a 
day of educational and nonviolent 
programs.

Pardee, Schwimmer and other 
colleagues studied 546 obese chil-
dren and teenagers who sought 
obesity treatment between 2003 
and 2005.  Parents reported how 
much TV their child watched on a 
typical day, and the child’s blood 
pressure was recorded.  About 43 
percent of the children had blood 
pressure readings that were in the 
hypertension range.  

Results from the study sug-
gested that children who watched 
two to four hours of TV daily were 
more than twice as likely to have 
high blood pressure than children 
who watch watched no more than 
two hours of TV.  

Other recommendations from 
the AAP include forbidding TV 
while eating and preventing chil-
dren who are two years old or 
younger from watching TV.

quent involvement be limited to just 
one meeting with the final nominee 
to prevent any potential leak of con-
fidential information to the public.

However, the UCSA has asserted 
that granting student representatives 
only one final meeting with the can-
didates violates the university’s own 
policy. UCOP spokesman Trey Davis 
denied this accusation, stating that 
the regents had done nothing wrong. 

“The assertion that the policy is 
being bypassed is not true,” Davis 
said. “The policy clearly states that 
past consultative practices are to be 
followed and what the student group 
is requesting in this instance has 
never been used in previous search-
es. Thus, it is the student group that 
is asking for a change in policy. As 
with other university personnel mat-
ters, there are privacy rights to pro-
tect in this deliberative process.” 

Additionally, the UCSA repre-
sentatives have said that they’ve felt 
a lack of respect from the Board of 
Regents, referring specifically to a 

Sept. 20 meeting between the two 
parties. After waiting two hours past 
their scheduled meeting time, the 
S.A.C. was met by only four of the 12 
regents serving on the special presi-
dential committee, two of whom left 
during the meeting.

According to Rabia Paracha, the 
S.A.C. representative from UCSD, 
these events have been particularly 
troubling, since the vast number 
of social and academic issues fac-
ing UC students have made student 
input a crucial element in selecting 
the new president. 

“The University of California stu-
dents are continuously facing high fees 
in addition to out-of-control hous-
ing costs around campus, which isn’t 
made any easier with the confusing 
financial aid process,” Paracha said. 
“With these issues on a rise, it is even 
more vital now than ever that students 
are heard in the selection process for 
the next UC president.”

UCSA President and S.A.C. Chair 
Oiyan Poon expressed similar con-
cerns, saying that she will not allow 

the student voice to be overlooked.
“The Student Advisory 

Committee will not be used as 
merely a ‘focus group’ in such an 
important search,” Poon said in a 
press release. “We will stay vigilant 
to ensure that shared governance is 
followed through and respected in 
this process.” 

In addition, Poon said that the 
S.A.C. is prepared to adhere to the 
established rules of the search pro-
cedure, so long as they do not inter-
fere with the committee’s right to be 
involved.

“We are also committed to the 
integrity of this process and the 
university’s reputation and are com-
pletely willing to take the steps to 
ensure confidentiality; however the 
search needs to be transparent to the 
university community too,” she said. 

No information regarding presi-
dential nominees has been released 
to the public at this time.

Regents Deny Violating University Policy

provided by UCSD Transportation 
and Parking Services. The location 
presents problems for some students 
because not only is the bus stop farther 
away from the students’ residences, 
but the shuttle is oftentimes over-
crowded after its first stop at the cor-
ner of Nobel Drive and Lebon Drive.

“Coming to school has become a 
lot more inconvenient because of the 
increase of people who are at the same 
shuttle stop now,” Revelle College 
sophomore Nisha Jadhaw said.  “A lot 
more people have to take the shuttle to 
school because the 48/49 does not run 
near their houses. I have had to come 
to the shuttle stop 30 minutes before 
class, and still get to class late because 

shuttles and buses have had to pass 
our stop because they were so full. 
My roommate has had to miss class 
because she never got on a bus.” 

The Villa Mallorca area has recent-
ly registered multiple reports of sto-
len and vandalized property, posing a 
concern for students forced to linger 
in the neighborhood, Revelle College 
Council Senior Representative Aria 
Jafari said.

“The recent cancellation of the bus 
lines only exacerbates the preexisting 
situation by leaving students vulner-
able at odd hours,” Jafari said.

Student activism pushed MTS 
officials to abandon their original 
plans to eliminate other routes serv-
ing the campus area, according to 

T&PS Hillcrest Medical Center and 
Rideshare Options Manager Samuel 
Corbett.

“Unfortunately, the 48/49 service 
change hearings occurred during the 
summer when much of the campus 
community was not around,” Corbett 
said. “MTS has recently attempted to 
further cut service on other transit 
routes (Routes 921 and 41) to cam-
pus, but we have managed to preserve 
this vital transit service to campus by 
applying political pressure and get-
ting UCSD students, staff and faculty 
to e-mail MTS protesting the service 
change.”

the bomb at the Vista Courthouse.
He is currently facing three 

charges: possession of, intention 
to make and transportation of a 
destructive device. More charges 
may be filed at a later date.  

Sgt. David Isley of the UCSD 
Police Department said that the 
close proximity of Voigt Drive to 
the bomb’s actual location forced 
officials to block off the bridge while 
the San Diego Sheriff Department’s 
bomb squad detonated the explo-
sive device.

The Oceanside Police Department 
had been conducting an investiga-
tion of the bomb in tandem with 
the CHP, the San Diego Fire-Rescue 
Department and the San Diego Police 
Department when UCPD received 
notice that the bomb was in close 
proximity to the bridge on Voigt. 
Therefore, UCPD handled the clo-
sure of the bridge.  

The bridge was initially closed at 
about 1:30 p.m., and was reopened 
after the threat had been neutral-
ized by remote control at approxi-
mately 3:30 p.m. Despite the clo-
sures, campus operations were 

largely unaffected, Isley said.
However, the closure was prob-

lematic for some students who rely 
on the shuttles for transportation 
to and from campus.

“I was stuck on campus for a 
few hours,” John Muir College 
junior Joanne Jao said. “I didn’t 
understand why the shuttles were 
stopped when it was the freeway 
that was affected. It was a really big 
inconvenience.”

Isley said that although it was 
inconvenient, the bridge’s closure 
was necessary to ensure the safety 
of everyone on campus.

“It wasn’t a major problem,” 
Isley said. “It was an inconvenience 
for two hours. We needed to make 
sure people were safe. I think peo-
ple understood.”

He said that he was not aware 
of any complaints being received 
about the closures, although UCPD 
did field many phone calls from 
people with questions about what 
had occurred.

“In the past, the position has been 
kind of unstable,” Chang said. “This 
year, we’re hoping to make it more 
stable and reach more students.”

Kaveh Cyrus was elected to serve as 
the 2006-07 Commissioner of Student 
Services, which at the time covered 
only A.S. Safe Ride and Volunteer 
Connection. After the council’s 
restructuring last November, Cyrus 
took on many of the functions of the 
former commissioner of communica-
tions, including relations with SRTV 
and KSDT.

The new constitution also changed 
the student services role from an elect-
ed commissionership to an appointed 
associate vice president position.

During spring quarter, Cyrus stud-
ied in Washington, D.C., and an inter-
im replacement was never appointed. 
During that time, the position’s duties 
were not fulfilled.

“When compared to Student 
Services in the past, I really don’t know 
what to expect,” Chang said. 

On the heels of last quarter’s leader-

ship void, Chang said she hopes that 
the new associate vice president will 
monitor registration and usage levels 
of A.S. Safe Ride and maintain sta-
tistics that will be helpful when next 
year’s council considers renewing the 
program’s contract.

According to A.S. President Marco 
Murillo, the latest action associated 
with student services was last winter 
quarter, when the council decided to 
expand the A.S. Safe Ride service to 
Thursdays. He said the department has 
been largely inactive since that time.

“We lost a lot of connections,” 
Murillo said. “We don’t really know 
what happened last year with SRTV. 
This is for [the A.S. Council] to better 
help student services. SRTV is starting 
to rebuild again after being closed.”

Chang said that she wants the 
appointee to make the monetary and 
managerial resources of an associate 
vice president available to both the 
SRTV and KSDT student media out-
lets, so they can be assisted with bud-
getary and publicity concerns without 
having to hire an official manager.

SRTV General Manager Ali Hadian 
agreed that last year’s relationship with 
the council left much to be improved.

He said he recalled gaps in com-
munication from last year’s operations, 
which was the station’s first year on the 
air after returning from a one-year hia-
tus. According to him, in some cases 
officers did not receive their stipends 
or expense reimbursements from the 
council. 

“We didn’t have very firm connec-
tions between the two,” Hadian said. 
“The communication was very poor.”

He said that SRTV’s “clean sweep” 
— a complete change in student lead-
ership — left the television station 
with all-new officers and a new studio 
this year.

“We’re basically rebuilding SRTV 
from scratch,” he said.

According to Hadian, the coun-
cil has been accommodating with its 
finances during the transition, a sign of 
already-improving relations.

So far, Hadian said he has been 
discussing SRTV’s needs informally 
with Chang. As the year progresses, 
he said that SRTV will benefit from a 
dedicated council liaison, as the station 
looks to increase publicity on campus.

A.S. COUNCIL —  The A.S. Office of Enterprise Operations 
has a new motto this year: waste money. It’s short, it’s simple, 

and with the council choosing to subsidize use of its Challenge 
Course just months after pumping more money into an external 

manager for the debt-ridden Grove Caffe, it’s looking to be pretty 
damn catchy.

The Challenge Course, a joint operation between the A.S. Council and 
UCSD Recreation, opened in May 2004 and has since predictably failed as a 

viable enterprise. But who ever thought people would pay upward of $300 to 
play on an oversized jungle gym in the first place? 

The partnership began when then-director of Outback Affairs Brain Grube 
and John Muir College Dean of Student Life Patty Mahaffey drafted the course’s 
proposal. They shopped the concept around to various student organizations, but 
no one seemed interested until then-A.S. Commissioner of Service and Enterprises 
Colin Parent decided to feed $60,000 of council funding into the project. 

Unfortunately for the fee-paying student, everyone else had the right idea, and 
the series of towers has remained expensive and generally unused (except by coun-
cilmembers themselves, who used the course for their recent retreat).

Now, after three stagnant years, Associate Vice President of Enterprise 
Operations Chelsea Maxwell announced the council is subsidizing the enterprise 
for student organizations. Basically, disinterest is so extreme that the council is 
paying people to use the course. And yet again, students see their governing body 
funnel money into something both futile and unnecessary. While useful resources 
continue to be under funded, student fees are repeatedly wasted trying to salvage 
hopeless businesses. 

The council, elected to serve students’ needs, continually disappoints. Why 
don’t councilmembers throw money into something students actually need 

Admit it: You love Facebook. In fact, I’d say that we’re all borderline addicted to the 
social networking Web site. Some of 
us check it once a day and some of 
us check it 13 times a day. And then 
there are others who check Facebook 
so often they instinctively type “face-
book.com” in the browser when they 
mean to type something else. (I’m 
guilty as charged.)

I have to give Facebook credit. 
Granted, the “news feed” is kind of 
creepy, but at the same time it’s so 
incredibly necessary. I mean, how else 
would you find out that one of your 
suitemates from freshman year who 
you don’t talk to anymore joined the 
group “It’s Not My Fault What You 
Said Can Be Misconstrued as a Sexual 
Innuendo” or “I Have a Crotch Staring 
Problem”? 

Even though people threw a fit 
when the “news feed” premiered, no 
one says a word about it now. New 
photos? Click. So-and-so is listed as 
“in a relationship.” Click. Joe Schmoe 
added paninis to his interests. 
Definitely click.

But for all of Facebook’s glory 
and all the nights I’ve spent staring 
aimlessly at my own profile — you 
know you do it too — for the love of 
Mark Zuckerberg, I need to call some 
people out. 

First of all, the “untag” function 
was invented for a reason. I’m tired of 
clicking “view more photos,” only to 
discover a page of Person X cuddling 
with her nasty dog. I don’t want to see 
that; show me something entertaining 
and/or hot — or else untag it. 

So the next time one of your 
friends decides to upload an album 
from last night’s stupid “Golf Pros and 
Tennis Hoes” party, please do us all a 
favor and go through them before the 
world sees your red, blotchy, mouth-
wide-open face at an odd diagonal 
angle and decides you’re no longer 
“Facebook hot.” Seriously, it’s for your 
own good.

Another thing: Every single 
Facebook Application (with the nota-
ble exception of “graffiti wall”) is, for 
lack of a better word, retarded. Why 
the hell would I want to join “flower 
shop” or “(fluff)friends”? Do people 
actually need that dumb “aquarium” 
function? How about buying me a 
real drink instead of sending me some 
fugly icon on “happy hour!”? And 
when did you become so cheap that 
you can’t spend $1 to send me a real 
gift? I mean, the free gifts aren’t even 
limited edition.

I can keep going, and I will. 
No, I’m not going to bite, chest 

bump, dropkick, grope, headbutt, 
high five, hug, kiss, lick, pet, pinch, 
slap, spank, sucker punch, throw a 
sheep at, tickle, trip or worship you. 
If you thought poking was weird, how 
creepy is online tickling? And why 
would you want someone to virtually 
pet you? The only action on that list I 
would even consider doing is throw-
ing a (life-size) sheep, but that’s a topic

Absent Admin 
Forces Vets 
to Fend for 

Themselves

NATIONAL NEWS — With all the 
premature brouhaha over next year’s 
presidential elections, it’s prob-
ably a safe assumption that most 
Americans have yet to make any 
decisions as to which candidate to 
support. Last weekend, the Florida 
Democratic Convention, an event 
that helps constituents make deci-
sions about issues and candidates, 
was boycotted by all but one presi-
dential candidate. 

One would expect the near 3,000 
attendees to applaud and support 
the one candidate who actually 
decided to show up, but those at the 
rally were fixated on something else 
entirely: those who weren’t present. 
Clearly something is rotten in the 
state of Florida.

The boycott was born after a 
violation of Democratic National 
Committee regulations, when the 
Florida state legislature rescheduled 
its primary to Jan. 29 (as opposed 
to Feb. 5), a move only permitted 
in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada 
and South Carolina. To punish the 
brazen state legislature, the DNC 

agreed to forbid presidential cam-
paigning in the state and preclude 
Florida’s 210 delegates from partici-
pating in next year’s national con-
vention in Denver. 

The ill-attended convention has 
already become 
a bit of an 
embarassment for 
state Democrats, 
with a pending 
lawsuit against the 
DNC and rumors 
of plans to sack 
the chairwoman 
of the Florida 
Democrats, Karen 
Thurman. 

So who was 
the Lone Ranger 
in attendance? 

Former-Alaskan-senator turned-
presidential-hopeful Mike Gravel, 
who, in recent voter polls, sadly 
trails behind “other” and “not vot-
ing,” had the daring to show up 
despite the embarrassing political 
bathos, defying the DNC’s morato-
rium on Florida presidential cam-
paigning. 

If one so much as casu-
ally watched some of the earlier 

Democratic debates, Gravel was hard 
to forget. Remember the endear-
ingly cantankerous, graying man who 
famously skewered an opponent with, 
“Who are you going to bomb today, 
Obama?” Yeah, that’s him. 

In addition 
to his straight 
shooting, Gravel 
boasts an illustri-
ous track record. 
He has made a 
name for himself 
in the course of 
American politi-
cal history, lauded 
for his efforts in 
ending the draft 
after the Vietnam 
War and circulat-
ing the scandal-

ous Pentagon Papers. 
By winning the hearts of pro-

gressive liberals with antiwar, pro-
choice and pro-same-sex marriage 
rhetoric, at first glance it may appear 
that little distinguishes him from his 
wealthier Democratic contenders 
(compare Barack Obama’s $33 mil-
lion in fundraising to Gravel’s paltry 
$130,000 in the same three-month 
period). However, his more contro-

versial causes have been startling for 
some, including marijuana decrimi-
nalization, abolition of the IRS and 
income tax and probably his most 
well-known and unprecedented mea-
sure: the National Initiative. This is 
a theoretical, constitutional amend-
ment whereby federal legislation 
could be introduced, modified or 
even vetoed by everyday citizens via 
ballot initiatives. It also proposes an 
accompanying regulatory body, the 
Electoral Trust, which would super-
vise this process. 

Politically disillusioned students 
have begun to find hope in Gravel 
and his forward-looking policies con-
cerning healthcare, climate change and 
nuclear disarmament. Finally, young 
voters are getting excited about poli-
tics. 

“I don’t need Hillary money,” he 
said during one of his many nearly 
deserted fundraisers. “She gets a mil-
lion in a night. If I can get just $10 
million, I will win.” 

But as with most dark horses (and 
Gravel is about as dark as they get), 
the road to the White House is grim.

Scarce services and lack 
of veteran affairs office  
leaves UCSD student 
vets wanting more from  
university officials.

By Jim Shen
Staff Writer

NATIONAL NEWS — In the latest 
attempt to deal with the massive 
influx of veterans returning from 
Afghanistan and Iraq, President 
George W. Bush announced his 
nominee for Secretary of Veterans 
Affairs on Oct. 30. 

While this may or may not stim-
ulate change at the Department of 
Veterans Affairs and improve ser-
vice for veterans, student veterans 
at UCSD lack university support 
and have to deal with the federal 
government’s bureaucracy. 

UCSD’s services for veterans 
need to be drastically improved, at 
least to levels that other colleges’ 
veterans enjoy.

Unlike San Diego State University 
and the San Diego Community 
Colleges, UCSD does not have an 
office for veterans affairs. 

Whereas other universities have 
dedicated sections of their Web 
sites to veterans, all the available 
information for veterans is grouped 
under the financial aid section of 
TritonLink.

“The school just sends you to 
the VA,” veteran and Earl Warren 
College senior Ryan Matson said. 
“They don’t really offer anything. 
They don’t even have a VA rep, 
although they do have a lady at the 
financial aid office. Nobody really 
has a job specifically for dealing 
with veterans.”

Some veterans are fine with 
UCSD’s level of support. Veteran

and want? Parking permit costs, for 
example, continue to skyrocket each 
year; surely students would love that 
expense subsidized. Or, if so much 
A.S. money is going to be squan-
dered, why doesn’t the council subsi-
dize its own activity fee?

But in all seriousness, what the 
council really needs to do is think 
long and hard about the future of 
its Office of Enterprise Operations. 
Over and over, the council’s busi-
nesses fall flat, and while poor over-
sight and execution are what often 
hammer the final nail into these 
enterprises’ coffins — what has the 
council ever done to properly publi-
cize the Challenge Course? — poor 
planning and uninspired models 
have them doomed from concep-
tion.

The argument has been made 
before, but why is the council spon-

soring a challenge course anyway? 
And why do students need an over-
priced A.S. cafe when the Mandeville 
coffee cart adjacent to the Grove is 
higher in quality? UCSD has excel-
lent science and engineering pro-
grams, so why doesn’t the Office of 
Enterprise Operations take advan-
tage and start up a cheap computer-
repair business? Or even a textbook 
exchange Web site, backed and pub-
licized by the council?  

The purpose of A.S. enterprises 
is to generate income while provid-
ing students with a valuable opera-
tion, but all the office has done is 
throw away money on things stu-
dents don’t want. 

What the council needs now is to 
focus its efforts on creating some-
thing practical, not propel another 
Grove-like failure by subsidizing 
what was a bad idea from the get-
go.

formerly obscure Jimmy Carter, who 
in 1976 snagged the presidency by a 
comfortable margin. In that spirit, 
Howard Dean’s progression from 
obscurity to being a veritable front-
runner in 2003 gives Gravelians a 
semblance of hope.  

Political pundits have recognized 
the underground, Internet-driven 
success of Ron Paul and Dennis 
Kucinich, but Mike Gravel remains 
the laughingstock of American poli-
tics. The experts fail to look beyond 
his falsely “peevish” disposition and 
dwell on the “inevitable failure” of 
his campaign. In so doing, they lose 

sight of his genuine concern for the 
country’s well-being.  

In an electoral culture character-
ized by eggshell-walking, double-
speak and monetary dependency, 
the candidates who are devoid of 
capital — but brave enough to speak 
the truth — are almost invariably 
left in the dust. It’s shameful that 
a country founded on inviolate 
principles of equality and freedom 
can harbor such a system, and in 
the process deny presidential aspi-
rants like Paul, Kucinich, Joe Biden 
and the affable Gravel a rightful 
chance at making it to Pennsylvania 
Avenue.  

Bush Admin Should Halt 
Nuclear Development

Dear Editor,
The University of California 

manages Lawrence Livermore 
National Laboratory, a facility lead-
ing the development of the so-called 
Reliable Replacement Warhead or 
RRW, the first new hydrogen bomb 
designed by the United States in 20 
years. 

Students and faculty at the uni-
versity therefore have a unique role 
to play in actively questioning this 
misguided U.S. nuclear weapons 
policy and UC system’s involvement 
in its implementation.

The Cold War is over and the 
threat of an all-out nuclear war 
with Russia has greatly diminished. 
Despite the fact that the United 
States still has nearly 10,000 nuclear 
warheads, the Bush administration 
argues that new nuclear weapons 
are needed to ensure “long-term 
confidence in the future stockpile.” 
The administration’s original argu-
ment was that plutonium pits, the 
cores of existing nuclear weapons, 
were aging and becoming “unreli-
able” — thus explaining the catchy 
nickname.

This argument is misleading, and 
ignores recent scientific findings. A 
2006 JASON report, a pre-eminent 
nuclear advisory group established 
by members of the World War II-
era Manhattan Project, found that 
plutonium pits safely and reliably 
function for at least 90 years — over 
twice what had been estimated pre-
viously. Given the age of the old-

est existing nuclear weapons in our 
stockpile, the U.S. nuclear deterrent 
is therefore guaranteed for at least 
another 50 years.

Other factors negate the need for 
new nuclear weapons. The safety 
and reliability of existing nuclear 
weapons is certified annually and 
closely monitored under life-exten-
sion programs using computer-gen-
erated models. The weapons’ reli-
ability is also based on more than 
1,000 tests.

A resumption of nuclear testing 
would violate the Comprehensive 
Test Ban Treaty, a mainstay of the 
nonproliferation regime, which 
the United States already signed. 
Developing new nuclear weapons 
would signal to the world that the 
United States, despite its over-
whelming conventional military 
superiority, believes it necessary to 
upgrade its nuclear arsenal. 

A recent study prepared for the 
Department of Defense observed, 
“The world sees us as shifting from 
nuclear weapons for deterrence and 
as a weapon of last resort to nuclear 
weapons for war fighting and first 
use.” This perception gives emerg-
ing world powers like China another 
reason to feel threatened by the 
United States and may embolden 
aspiring powers to seek their own 
homegrown nuclear weapons.

Developing new nuclear weap-
ons undermines our diplomatic 
leadership in stemming the spread 
of nuclear weapons by undermin-
ing our Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty commitments. Many states 
that gave up the right to acquire 
these weapons have expressed con-

cern that the United States is not 
living up to its end of the bar-
gain under the NPT to work toward 
the eventual elimination of nuclear 
weapons.

Building new nuclear weapons 
will not make us safer. It will do 
nothing to deter terrorists, and it 
will not improve our strategic rela-
tionships with other countries. It 
will only undermine efforts to pre-
vent the spread of nuclear weap-
ons, extend outdated Cold War-era 
thinking, shirk our international 
commitments, waste a lot of money 
and threaten our long-term secu-
rity.

for a different day.
If I actually wanted to know about 

your “causes,” your heritage or where 
you’ve been, I would ask. And “iLike”? 
Still don’t care. All these things do is 
convolute your page and make it more 
difficult for me to locate your “wall-
to-wall” link.

There’s just one more thing I need 
to say about applications. What’s 
with the vampire/werewolf/pirate/
ninja/zombie bullshit? To everyone 
who keeps sending me invitations: I 
haven’t joined now, and I never will. 
So stop, for real.

Moving on: Sorry, but when I say 
I’m “maybe attending” your event, 
nine times out of 10 I’m not going. It’s 
not really anything personal, it’s just 
that I don’t want to attend “Scrum by 
the Sea!!!” or “Rainbow Festival and 
Conference.” And as much as I wish I 
could bring myself to watch a “Health 
Care Debate Panel,” I’m going to have 
to take a raincheck — forever.

Finally, I have to say that everyone 
should really be wary of two things: 
their individual wall-writing strate-
gies and their “mini-feed.” It’s obvi-
ous that when you click “wall-to-

wall” between two random friends 
and notice that Person A has left 19 
comments to Person B’s two, there’s 
a problem there for all your friends 
to see. So keep it in check. 

And bitch, I know you got that 
message I sent you three days ago 
because I can see the activity in your 
“mini-feed”; it says you’ve been too 
busy commenting on your friend’s 
photos to write me back.

Like it or not, Facebook is defi-
nitely an important part in all of our 
lives. (What else would we do when 
we’re procrastinating on our biology 
reading?) 

Nearly everyone uses Facebook, 
and for good reason. It has become a 
way to stay connected with friends at 
all hours of the night while simulta-
neously serving as a means for us to 
invent — and skillfully embellish, if 
you’re a real pro — a virtual identity 
for ourselves. And I’m not saying that 
this identity should be abandoned. I 
just think that people need to fine-
tune their Facebooking techniques or 
risk looking like an idiot, or worse. 

Now, please excuse me while I 
update my status: Matthew is look-
ing for random play.

and John Muir College senior 
Andrew Kleist, has few complaints 
about the system as a whole, but 
even he acknowledged that the uni-
versity offers very little support for 
veterans.

“UCSD offers nothing, but per-
sonally I don’t particularly care,” 
Kleist said. “The only thing I can 
think of for them to improve was 
that it was difficult for me to find 
out what forms I needed at the 
beginning for the GI Bill benefits. 
The information might be out there, 
but they should make it easier to 
find.”

With many veterans returning 
from Iraq and Afghanistan and 
going to college for the first time, 
this lack of support is simply unac-
ceptable. 

While some veterans do not want 
or need services beyond what the 
school already provides, others do, 
and the school is failing its obliga-
tion to veterans as long as a single 
one is unsatisfied. Though UCSD 
has fewer veterans on campus than 
SDSU, our veterans are no less wor-
thy than theirs. Even UC Berkeley, 
a campus known for its antiwar 
leanings, has a dedicated veterans 
service office.

“A lot of the junior colleges 
[around San Diego] have veterans 
offices, and you can go straight to 
the office on campus,” Matson said. 
“Here, they give you your paper-
work, and then you have to file it 
yourself.”

Denying veterans the same on-
campus services that others receive 
from other colleges spits in the face 
of their service and sacrifice, as 
well as tarnishing UCSD’s reputa-
tion as a top-notch university. As 
a start, the university could con-
sider hiring more staff members for 
the Registrar’s and Financial Aid 
Offices to provide veterans services 
instead of giving senior administra-

tors pay raises. 
Creating a dedicated veter-

ans services office with a staff that 
doesn’t force veterans to wait three 
months for their paperwork to be 
processed, like Matson did, is the 
very least the university can do.

Beyond merely ensuring that 
UCSD veterans can get their ben-
efits, the university can take many 
hints from the types of support 
that neighboring colleges offer. For 
example, at SDSU, students who 
have service obligations — such as 
being called up from the reserves 

— suffer no academic penalties, can 
obtain refunds on textbooks and are 
eligible for other benefits that help 
make the transition easier.

UCSD has no such policies, leav-
ing veterans in the reserves or with 
other extenuating circumstances at 
the mercy of the fourth-week drop 
deadlines and standard withdrawal 
process. 

Coming up with a sensible policy 
instead of leaving it to the individ-
ual veteran to petition his or her 
case could spare both the university 
and veterans needless hassle in the 
future.

UCSD also lacks an organiza-
tion dedicated to student veterans. 
An attempt by Matson and other 
student veterans to form a student 
organization last year ended in fail-
ure because the school forces such 
organizations to re-register every 
year. 

According to Matson, currently 
the university provides no meth-
od for veterans to get in contact 
with each other. While it would be 
daft to grant only veterans a special 
exemption from the re-registration 
requirement, the university could 
instead provide a way for veterans to 
easily contact one another. 

The services that the universi-
ty should provide for veterans are 
not unreasonable, especially con-
sidering that neighboring colleges 
already do so. 

There may be only a few veterans 
at UCSD, but they deserve the best 
possible support.

“The university can take many hints from the types of support that 
neighboring colleges 

offer.”

Y ou gave me cashews, man — I can’t smoke this,” complains a drug-addicted Michael Swaim in a Those Aren’t Muskets sketch. “If I come over and 
give you money for weed, are you going to shoot at my 
car again?”

TAM is a sketch comedy troupe that formed three 
months ago from a partnership between two recent UCSD 
graduates, Swaim and Abe Epperson. 

“We just spent a month making the Web site and get-
ting the Web site live,” Swaim said. “We have a pretty 
regular workflow; every two weeks we have a production 
cycle that produces a new sketch.”

Right now, the Muskets’ Web site is home to 11 sketch-
es, some of which have over 100,000 views each. 

“My favorite thing about Those Aren’t Muskets is their 
wit and their humor,” Sixth College sophomore Brentan 
Schellenbach said. “I watch them almost every day. I feel 
like they’re people I could get to know and respect in real 
life. They seem very approachable and they’re just hilari-
ous.”

Epperson and Swaim share creative duties, with Swaim 
serving as the primary writer and Epperson as the direc-
tor and visual editor. The Muskets recently signed a deal 
with humor Web site Cracked.com, which gives them the 
opportunity to make more — ambitious videos.

“They just approved ‘Internet Party,’ which I’m really 
excited about,” Swaim said. “We’re back to what I think we 
like the best, which is giant, elaborate real sketches that 
are a narrative and have high production values. It’s got 13 
characters, and it’s going to be a really good shoot.”

Because the group has a core membership of only two 
people, most of the Muskets’ cast and crew come from a 
pool of friends and connections made at UCSD in Swaim 
and Epperson’s respective majors, theater and visual arts. 
The group feels a strong connection to the campus and is 
looking to expand its audience there.

“We’ve had a cinematographer from UCSD come in 
when I’m in sketches,” Epperson said.

Swaim is currently writing and producing the com-
edy play “Olympus Inc.” through UCSD’s undergraduate 
cabaret program, and hopes to include the cast in future 
Muskets sketches.

 “It’s going up in Galbraith 157 the weekend of week 
seven,” he said. “It’s the most ambitious play that has ever 
been done through the program, and of the 16 castmem-
bers, eight to 10 of them have asked me to do TAM stuff.”

In addition to their close working relationship with 
UCSD and its students, Swaim and Epperson said their 
partnership and differing strengths help create Muskets’ 
unique comedy sketch style.

“I think a problem with a lot of amateur people mak-
ing comedy, as we are, is that they think all they need is 
a funny idea,” Swaim said. “That’s basically all I do, and

N o matter how bad the onshore breeze and swell might be, an overhead 
wave can always be found at 
Mission Beach. San Diego’s 
Wavehouse, a restaurant and 
surf simulator,  is the first of its 
kind and was opened in 2004 
by UCSD alumni and La Jolla 
native Tom Lochtefeld, who 
engineered the wave-making 

technology. The two artificial 
waves fuse surfing, snowboard-

ing and skateboarding techniques 
into the only manmade barreling 

wave in the country. 
The Flowrider, a smaller wave 

that first-timers have to ride before 
moving onto a bigger wave, feels like 

a never-ending shoulder that amateurs 
have to ride in order to move onto the 

bigger wave. Consisting of a mild slope 
with jets of water covering the foam, the 
Flowrider lets newbies get a feel for the board 
without getting roughed up. Brutus Maximus, 
a constant 8-to-10-foot barrel, lives up to 
its intimidating name, occasionally spitting 
out riders bruised and battered. Thanks to 
inch-thick foam padding, the fall isn’t nearly 
as bad as a skateboarding fall on a similarly 
steep half pipe. 

The Wavehouse is far from secret: Tony 

Hawk, Kelly Slater and Sunny Garcia are just 
some of the super-athletes that have come out 
to play on the endless waves.

Located along the boardwalk overlooking 
the ocean, the WaveHouse has a tropical-get-
away vibe. Its walkways are lined with sand 
and palm trees, and nearby kava bars serve up 
drinks, burgers, nachos and plenty of seafood 
to recharge energy after a major wipeout. 

Wave prices on the waves range from $20 
to $40 per hour, while a seasonal pass gets you 

on the waves all winter. The water temperature 
is in the mid 70s, so wetsuits are optional even 
when the ocean gets frigid. Wintertime replac-
es the Wavehouse’s nonstop summer party 
with smaller lines, special discounts and room 
to breathe.

Stepping out of the elevator on the 11th floor, two hotel resi-dents glanced back at me. The 
sound of music, just loud enough to 
be heard but not deciphered, poured 
into the elevator shaft, out of the 
stairwell and across the otherwise-
silent lobby. The doors closed and 
I hit 17. Glancing into the elevator’s 
mirrored wall, 
I took one final 
look at my dark-
blue pinstriped 
suit jacket, pink 
shirt and blue 
jeans. I marveled 
through bug-
eyed sunglasses 
at my slick, black greasy mullet and 
handlebar mustache. 

Halloween in Cairo marked 
the halfway point for many study-
abroad students who will be return-
ing home in less than two months. 
According to most of these students, 
they have reached what was char-
acterized during orientation as the 
“home” stage of cultural adjustment, 
when international guests begin to 
feel comfortable with Cairo’s life-
style and daily interactions while 
still maintaining a sense of loyalty to 
their own culture.

Northwestern University senior 
Halley Morrissey said she feels like 
she has reached a point in her stay 
where she is “culturally saturated” — 
no longer frustrated or out of place, 
but likely unable to grow more in her 
experience. 

“I could stay another week or 
another year and I feel like it would 
just be day-to-day life,” she said.

Cairo’s small everyday peculiari-
ties have become commonplace for 
many international students, and 
cease to stand out. Women in gaudy, 

brightly colored hijabs, with styl-
ish makeup and Gucci bags pass 
unnoticed. Children play soccer in 
every available public space; women 
in revealing western dresses shop-
ping with those in traditional black 
burqas or djellabas hardly draw sec-
ond looks.

In a country that outlaws homo-
sexuality, two 
men walking 
arm in arm no 
longer seems 
a question-
able contradic-
tion. In a city 
with traffic that 
could make the 

most aggressive American drivers 
seem tame, a motorcycle carrying an 
entire family is no longer a shock-
ing sight. And the constant presence 
of white-uniformed police no longer 
instills worry or a sense of unease.

Nevertheless, the Nov. 1 
Halloween party at the Marwa 
Palace Hotel, where the American 
University in Cairo rents three floors 
for international-student housing, 
was a way for the American students 
to get a taste of home in the middle 
of their international experience, 
despite settling comfortably within 
Egyptian culture.

In the hotel’s upper floors, music 
blasted and sweat hung in the air; cig-
arette smoke drifted from the corner. 
Crowds of dancing pirates, mummies, 
sexy kittens and a fully cloaked Zorro 
bounced and threw their hands in the 
air. Cameras flashed, shouts dropped 
dead in the uproar of partygoers and 
there was little sign of a culture for-
eign to the United States.

Outside, life went on normally. 
The youth gathered along the Nile’s  
bank and chatted along the railings 

of several bridges connecting the east 
and west banks. Families perused the 
shops of Sharia Talat Harb into the 
late hours of the night, car horns 
blared and small coffee shops filled 
with men sipping tea and smoking 
shisha. 

Without a costume and plagued 
by a cough, Pennsylvania State 
University junior Nivedita Bhushan 
danced most of the night, enjoying the 
spectacle and the hiatus from Cairo’s 
daily grind.

“I like Egypt, but I still miss 
America,” she said. “It’s nice to feel 
back at home once in a while.”

I did not feel at home standing in 
the elevator and for the first time in 
more than a month, I felt extremely 
out of place as I rode a taxi alone 
across the city, drawing curious stares 
from the passengers in other cars. 

“I look ridiculous,” I thought to 
myself over and over again.

As I stepped through the entrance 
and into the ground floor lobby the 
six security guards lounging near 
the door hardly gave me a glance. It 
had been a long night of ridiculous 
Americans. My fellow passengers on 
the elevator up asked me not to hit 
the button for my floor until they got 
off, saying they were worried “the 
damn elevator might skip the floor.” 
The way they looked at me, I was 
sure they thought I was serious about 
my attire and the mustache crawling 
down the sides of my chin. I hadn’t 
felt this awkward since my first two 
weeks of exploring Cairo.

I had since adjusted to the con-
stant curiosities of locals, from whom 
I clearly stand out, to the frequent 
“welcome to Egypt” shouts from 
shop owners and to the persistent

then Abe attacks it from the opposite 
angle and uses all the tools of film to 
make it funny. Pacing, editing and 
camerawork are a huge component 
that I think is missing in a lot of 
Internet sketch comedies, and I think 
it’s one of the things that makes us 
excellent.”

Epperson said the Muskets’ ambi-
tions come partly from a “VIYOB 
craze” — video in your own backyard.

“It’s this idea that anyone can be a 
producer if you have a Macbook Pro 
and a camera,” Epperson said. “At 
that point almost anyone who has 
a little money and the wherewithal 
and ambition can do whatever they 
want. Why not access that and just 
cut out the corporate part?”

Epperson and Swaim plan to 
keep the comedy troupe active and 
producing sketches every two weeks 
for at least a year, after which they 
will decide whether to continue in 

Los Angeles or part ways.
“At the end of the year, the best 

case scenario would be having the 
opportunity, financially, to continue 
working on what I want to work 
on,” said Swaim. “This is what I love 

to do; my goal in life is to do this. I 
think we’re succeeding right now … 
I don’t have to treat everything as a 
monumental project … it’s some-
thing that happens twice a month, 
and that’s incredible to me.”

Epperson hopes the pair will be 
able to continue working together 
next year. He said working with 
Swaim is the most enjoyable part 
of TAM.

“It’s a unique relationship because 
we live with each other,” Epperson 
said. “There’s something about a 
work relationship that is literally at 
your doorstep all the time. We just 
turn on and turn off. It’s literally, 
‘Hey, Those Aren’t Muskets non-
sense,’ and then ‘Hey! Larry David!’ 
It’s a really nice, relaxing situation, 
but you’d be alarmed at how effi-
cient we are.”

Of course, having a compatible 
business partner and roommate 
isn’t the only thing Epperson enjoys 
about working with Swaim.

“Also the mad cocaine parties,” 
he said, laughing. “Those are great.”

As the task of paying for col-
lege becomes increasingly daunting, 
more students are turning to pro-
grams like work study to lighten 
fiscal burdens. 

The Financial Aid Office works 
with the Career Services Center to 
provide work-study jobs around 
campus. About 98 percent of on-
campus jobs can be used for work 
study, including those at dining halls 
and the UCSD Bookstore. Work-
study awards can even be used in any 
non-work-study jobs with consent of 
the work-study coordinators.

Students apply for work study 
each year by submitting a Free 
Application for Federal Student Aid 
and other documents requested by 
the Financial Aid Office. Students 
who fall within a certain income 
range are granted a work-study 
award, which ranges between $600 
and $2,800 depending on need.

“Work study is part of our finan-
cial aid award,” said Financial Aid 
Director Vincent DeAnda. “We have 
works, loans and grants. Some stu-
dents that don’t want to work take 
out bigger loans and package it 
with those three things.” 

Work-study jobs are nearly 
identical to normal jobs. Students 
are paid every two weeks for the 
hours worked. Employers pay 
50 percent of the wages while 
the federal government pro-
vides the other 50 percent. 
Work-study jobs are also as 
competitive as regular jobs, 
as preference is often 
given to students 
with work study. 
However, income 
received from work-study jobs is not 
included in calculating total income 
for financial aid, so students can 
receive other financial aid that they 
qualified for before work study.

The Financial Aid Office, located 
on the third floor of the Student 
Services Center, prepares the finan-
cial aid packages for students who 
qualify, and organizes the work-
study program. 

“We don’t want to price [UCSD] 
out so a poor student or even a 
lower-middle income student can’t 

come here — or a middle class stu-
dent for that matter,” DeAnda said. 
“We don’t want the fees to be so high 
that a middle class family can’t pay 
them.”

One place students can work is 
Sierra Summit, John Muir College’s 
dining hall. Sixth College sopho-
more Kathy Tsou works as a floater 
at Summit, where she was trained 
to work at every station, including 
the kiosk, smoothie station and ice 
cream station. Tsou decided to get a 
job at Summit because of the conve-
nience of its on-campus location and 
the good 
food.

“Working is very important 
because it is how I am paying parts of 
my way through school,” Tsou said.

With so much going on, the 
$1,000 to $1,500 a year for tuition 
Tsou earns from working at Summit 
definitely takes some financial pres-
sure off her mind.

With the high cost of college, 
work study provides students a way 
to avoid taking out more loans and 
relieve money-trenched woes.

is the Tritons’ leading scorer, will 
return for their next contest against 
UC Irvine. 

“He’ll be back for the next game 
better than ever,” Schafer said.

UCSD is hoping that playing 
a strong team like the Bruins will 
help prepare itself for the WWPA 
championships.

“After playing UCLA, all the other 
teams should seem slower and weaker 
in comparison,” Gresham said. 

The game against UCLA was 
the Tritons’ last home game of 
the season and UCSD honored its 
three seniors — Miller, Schafer and 
Willamson — before the game.

“It’s a difficult experience — it’s 
bittersweet in a way,” Schafer said. 
“Everybody on our team laid it 
on the line and the seniors really 
appreciate that.”

The Tritons will end their regu-
lar season on the road against No. 
5 UC Irvine on Nov. 7 and No. 5 
Pepperdine University on Nov. 10. 
And although they’re looking past 
the next two matches, UCSD isn’t 
going to take the challenges lightly.

“We’re playing against two great 
opponents in Irvine and [Malibu],” 
Gresham said. “We just need to 
work on improving and tightening 
up our overall game so we are ready 
for conference.”

One of the many reasons for the No. 14 Tritons’ Nov. 3 loss at the hands of the second-ranked 
Bruins is that they were without their leading scorer, sophomore two-meter Daniel Garcia.

fashion, with the Tritons giving up 
the game’s first goal after just 69 
seconds. Despite a few opportunities, 
UCSD was unable to put a goal across 
in the first half, and trailed 2-0 when 
the Golden Eagles eventually scored 
again in the 80th minute. However, 
the Tritons avoided a shutout when 
Campbell scored her second goal 
of the year in the 90th minute. She 
made one more attempt at an equal-
izing goal in the waning seconds of 
the game, but her shot from 20 yards 
away sailed just wide.

To return to their winning ways, 
the Tritons will have to play coher-
ently as a team in order to over-
come their numerous injuries. Last 
week, the Tritons lost senior mid-
fielder Lauren Segars, while senior 
midfielder Cailtin Ryan and senior 
defender Stacy Johnson are still try-
ing to overcome their respective 
problems.

“It’s just been a matter of inju-
ries,” McManus said. “It has really 
just been chaos. When you’re try-
ing to juggle different players every 
week in such a short space of time 
its really tough on the kids. But we’ll 
go up to Seattle and use the players 
we have and I’m sure they’ll give us 
100 percent.”

Sophomore midfielder Alexia 
Zatarian stressed the importance of 
team play in rebuilding morale that 
has been weakened by injuries.

“We need to work more on play-
ing as a team as a whole and playing 
for each other and for the seniors,” 
Zatarain said. “We also really need 
to get our confidence back. We have 
lost some of the confidence from 
early in the season because of all the 
injuries so it’s just a matter of getting 
it back. So many people have been 
hurt all year that everybody going 
out and playing together has been 
hard. There has been a different 
team on the field for almost every 
game and learning to play together 
gets really hard when that happens.”

The Tritons’ ability to adjust to 
debilitating injuries and continue 
to play well will be a testament to 
their resilience and will serve as 
motivation for the upcoming NCAA 
Regional.

“We’re pretty confident because 
along with our record we have a 
good team,” freshman midfielder 
Lisa Bradley said. “The end of our 
season had a lot of injuries but I 
think that even with the injuries 
to the starters we were able to pull 
through as a team and overcome the 
obstacles.”

credit because they fought really hard 
and didn’t admit defeat.”

UCSD fought back, slowly chipping 
away at Humboldt State’s lead, finally 
closing within two points after a pair of 
aces from Schmidt. But with their new-
found confidence, the Lumberjacks 
weren’t rattled and pulled away to a 
comfortable 23-16 lead. The Tritons 
put together one final run behind the 
aggressive serving of junior defensive 
specialist Michelle Torres and senior 
outside hitter Casey Wilson. But the 
run came up short as Humboldt State 
scored the final five points to force a 
decisive game five.

After a five-game battle in their 
last match, the Tritons were at risk of 
exhaustion at the worst possible time. 
But they still seemed to find their 
offensive rhythm, exploding to a 12-4 
lead in game five. Ries and Wilson 
closed out the match with a kill apiece, 
giving UCSD its third straight victory.

Black was happy about his players’ 
stamina, which helped them deal with 

both the mental and physical pres-
sures that the squad faced going into 
game five.

“We really had a letdown in game 
three and were trying to find our com-
posure in that fourth game,” Black said. 
“It showed a lot of maturity to not go 
down with the ship and wipe the slate 
clean in that fifth game. We go hard in 
practice and the weight room so we’re 
ready for the fifth game.”

Despite the recent success in five-
game matches, the team wants to 
improve its finishing ability.

“We have been known as fifth-gam-
ers these past couple of years,” Bailey 
said. “We train hard all year so we’re 
conditioned for these fifth games. We 
practice the high stress situations in 
practice and it pays off. We take great 
pride in knowing that we’re not worn 
out and tired, and it’s asking a lot of the 
other team. We take advantage of it.” 

The Tritons will close out their 
regular season Nov. 9 and Nov. 10 at 
home against Sonoma State and Cal 
State Monterey Bay, respectively.

NCAA Controls Fate After Playoff  Loss

By Jake Blanc
Staff Writer

As hard as the UCSD women’s 
soccer team has worked through-
out the season to succeed, it no 
longer con-
trols its own 
destiny. After 
their 2-1 loss 
to Cal State 
Los Angeles 
on Nov. 2 in 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association semifinal game, the 
Tritons bowed out of contention for 
the conference championship, mak-
ing this only the second time in the 
last eight years that they did not 
capture the CCAA Championship. 
However, because of the Tritons’ 
outstanding play all year long, they 
will most likely get an at-large bid 
for the NCAA Regional in Seattle, 
Wash.

UCSD’s fate should be decided 
Nov. 5, but the Tritons’ 12-3-2 record 
almost guarantees that they will be 
granted a spot to play in the first 
round. Head coach Brian McManus, 
who has won seven national cham-
pionships with UCSD, said he feels 
cautiously confident about his team’s 
chances of being chosen for the 

NCAA Regionals.
“If we’re not in the regionals then 

there is something wrong,” McManus 
said. “We’re 12-3-2 on the year and 
most other teams have eight losses 
or even three ties, so that most likely 
means we’re going up to Seattle.”

While that prediction will most 
likely come true, some players who 

have been in similar situations 
before are making sure that they 
don’t assume they are shoo-ins.

“We have no idea yet about 
regionals,” senior midfielder Chelsey 
Campbell said. “We thought we 
would get in my freshman year in 
2004 and we didn’t. But now with six 
teams getting bids from the west we 

have a lot more confidence that we’re 
going to be playing in Seattle.”

The Tritons are tensely hovering 
in this position because they were 
unable to advance past Cal State Los 
Angeles on the afternoon of Nov. 
2. The match started in an unusual

Heading into its Nov. 2 match 
against Humboldt State, the UCSD 
women’s volleyball team had never suf-
fered a loss against the Lumberjacks. 
Although the Tritons floundered after 
building an early lead on Nov. 2, they 
continued the trend, eventually pre-
vailing with a 30-17, 30-20, 28-30, 23-
30, 15-7 victory. 

The win catapulted UCSD into sec-
ond place in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association with an 11-
5 record, behind only Cal State San 
Bernardino, which is 15-1 in CCAA 
play.

Only two games remain before 
playoff competition begins, but as 
head coach Tom Black has preached 
all season, the team is solely focusing 
on its next game, ignoring talk of the 
playoffs.

“We know we have two tough games 
coming up,” Black said. “Sometimes it’s 
hard not to look ahead, but I think the 
girls are very good at staying focused 
on the next game. It’s hard to even 
predict what will happen in playoffs 
right now, and we have our hands full 
this weekend.”

UCSD got off to a blistering start 
in game one with a 15-7 lead. The 
impressive display continued as the 
lead stretched to 13, and the Tritons 
cruised to a game one win. Senior 
opposite Amber Ries, sophomore mid-
dle blocker Sylvia Schmidt and junior 
outside hitter Rebecca Bailey led the 
attack. 

Senior setter Kim Adams recorded 
two aces and Ries added a pair of kills 
as UCSD jumped out to a 10-5 advan-
tage to begin game two. Humboldt 
State answered right back, pulling 
within two points and forcing Black to 
use a timeout. After exchanging points, 
the Tritons again extended their lead 
to five after kills from Schmidt and 
Bailey. 

The Lumberjacks continued to pes-
ter UCSD, again pulling within two. 
But the Tritons scored the next four 
points behind the serving of senior 
libero Natalie Facchini and were never 
threatened again, capturing game two.

Down but not out, Humboldt 
State battled for an early lead in game 
three. Junior outside hitter Kimberly 
Carpenter put the Tritons ahead 7-5 
with a 6-0 service run. UCSD used 
another 6-0 run led by junior middle 
blocker Hannah Gary, who recorded 
three kills and a block during the run, 
which boosted the Tritons to a com-
manding 15-8 lead.

Up 24-14 after another kill from 
Bailey, the Lumberjacks made good 
on their name, as the team chopped 
away at the UCSD lead. They forced 
the Tritons into a timeout with an 11-
3 run and scored two more to tie the 
game at 27-27. UCSD had no answer 
late in the game as Humboldt State 
completed the improbable comeback 
to take game three.

The Lumberjacks continued to 
build momentum in game four, scoring 
seven of the first eight points. After the 
disappointing game three, the Tritons 
looked confused and couldn’t find the 
offensive sync that they had relied on 
during the match’s first two games.

“We had a pretty good lead and 
we got comfortable,” Bailey said. “We 
made a few errors and Humboldt State 
jumped on that. You have to give them

The No. 14 UCSD men’s water 
polo team has two more regular sea-
son games, but all of its focus is on 
the Western Water Polo Association 
Conference Championships later 
this month. Although the Tritons 
could have made a statement 
against No. 2 UCLA on Nov. 3 
at Canyonview Pool, the Bruins 
proved too much for the Tritons, 
trouncing UCSD in a 6-14 blowout.

Despite being unable to over-
come a top-ranked squad, the 
Tritons were not worried about 
their fifth straight loss and have 
shifted their efforts to the WWPA 
Conference Championship in 
Colorado Springs, Col., beginning 
Nov. 16.

“We went out there and played 
as hard as we could,” senior two-
meter Simon Schafer said. “These 
are pretty much practice games for 
us. Results, in terms of wins and 
losses, aren’t as important to us 
right now. Our goal is the confer-
ence championship.”

 UCSD’s effort was evident from 
the start of the game, when freshman 
goalkeeper Mark Stemler made an 
impressive save against UCLA’s first 
possession. After a Bruin player was 
ejected to give the Tritons a 6-on-5 
advantage, sophomore two-meter 
defender Steven Donohoe scored to 
give UCSD an early lead. But UCLA 
answered back with a quick score, 
tying the game 1-1 after only one 
minute of game play.

The Bruins scored three more 

times in the quarter, while holding 
the Tritons scoreless, to give UCLA 
a 4-1 lead after the first quarter. The 
Tritons drew two more ejections 
but were unable to convert on the 
man-up opportunities. 

 The Tritons opened up scor-
ing again in the second quarter, 
this time with senior driver Curtis 
Williamson scoring off a foul. The 
Bruins scored on the ensuing pos-
session to extend their lead to 5-2. 
Sophomore utility Peter Gresham 
converted on yet another UCSD 
man-up opportunity to cut the 
UCLA lead to 5-3 with 5 minutes, 
25 seconds left in the quarter.

The Bruins pulled away dur-
ing the rest of the second quarter, 
starting with a counterattack goal 
6-3 with 4:13 left in the half. They 

scored three more goals in the half, 
capitalizing on messy offensive play 
from the Tritons to take a 9-3 half-
time lead. 

The third quarter was more of a 
defensive battle than the first half 
of the game. The Tritons had two 
more 6-on-5 opportunities but were 
unable to score on either of them. 
UCLA then scored the quarter’s 
only goal to take a 10-3 lead going 
into the final period. 

UCLA added two more goals at 
the beginning of the fourth quarter 
to up their lead to 12-3. Senior 
driver Benjamin Miller, Gresham 
and sophomore utility Ian Bausback 
added scores for the Tritons in the 
fourth quarter, but by then the game 
was out of reach. 

Even though the Tritons lost the 

game, their man-up offense, which 
has struggled all year, showed some 
marked improvements. UCSD con-
verted on four of its nine opportu-
nities, yielding a respectable con-
version percentage.

“We really need to work on our 
man-up offense for conference,” 
Gresham said. “Conversions for that 
are really important. It hasn’t been 
gelling but it was better [against 
UCLA]. We need to take a loosey-
goosey laid-back approach. We’re 
not going to drastically change any-
thing.”

The Tritons were playing with-
out starting two-meter man soph-
omore Daniel Garcia because of 
team-related issues. Garcia, who
