student 

fees again 
Hike hinges on 

state budget 
By DANIEL EVERS 

Contributing Writer 

The UC Board of Regents 
voted to increase ~U1dellt fee~ for 
the 2006-07 yea r, responding to 
both funding needs of new pro-
grams und er the proposed C 
budget as well a~ dwindling state 
support for the 10-ca mpus sys-
tem, according to R.ivi Poorsina, 
spokeswoman for the UC Office 
of the President. 

"Student fees have increased 
at UC in recent years in direct 
response to the decline in state 
support for public highel educa-
tion," Poorsina said. 

Since 2000, Californja lawmak-
ers have reduced funding for the 
UC system by 15 percent, accord-
ing to Poorsina. 

Although the budget passed, 
including the fee increases, it 
was clear from discussion at the 
meeting that the regents were not 
enthusiastic about t he possibil-
ity of raising fees. Regent George 
Marcus proposed an amendment 
to the budget elimi n ati ng fee 
increases for graduate sUldents, 
necessary, he said, if California is 
to attract the best and the bright-
est. T he motion failed by a close 
vote of 10-9. 

Another proposed motion, 
which failed by a simHarly small 
margin of 11 -8, would have post-
poned the vote on whether or not 
to increase fees unti l the regents' 
January meeting. Instead of delay-
ing the vote on increasing fees, 
the board instead voted, by a mar-
gin of 17-2, in favor of adding 
an additional part to the budget. 
This provison states that should 
the governor's budget provide ade-
quate funding, the proposed fee 
increase will be reduced or elirru-
nated, depending on how much 
money the governor is willing to 
allocate to the university. 

T he 8-percent in c'rea e will 
boost fees by 492 per yea r, bring-
ing the systemwide tota l to $6,633 
per yea r. Additi onal fees charged 
by individual cam puses bring the 
total average U1ition to an esti-
mated 7,294 per year, according 
to Poorsina. 

Meanwhile, graduate sUldents 
stand to have their fees increased 
by 10 percent, raising costs to 
$7,587. The number is further 
increased to an average of $9,398 
per year, takjng into account the 
rruscellaneous fees charged by indi-
vidual campuses, Poorsina said. 

T he UC budget includes a 
number of new proposa ls and pro-
grams to be implemented, each 
requiring that some of the fund-

Alumni Association mulls 
athletic scholarships 

By YASHA SHARMA 
Contributing Writer 

The UCSO Alumni Association 
Scholarsrup Comrrunee will dis-
cuss a proposal at a meeting later 
this week that would bring UCSD 
into compliance with NCAA 
Division n requirements by offer-
ing a nUnimum of $250,000 in 
athletic grants-in-aid. The plan, if 
approved, would be an alternative 
to the grants-in-aid proposal that 
the Academic Senate will discuss 
later this month. 

The plan would award $500 
to every student athlete with no 
financial need, and up to $2,000 to 
low-income sUldents, depending 
on the amount of need. 

Unlike the grants-in-aid pro-
posal that was reviewed by the 
Academic Senate at its spring 
meeting, the Alumni Association's 
plan will require every eligible SUl-
dent athlete to maintain a GPA of 
3.2 while at UCSD, compared to 
a 2.7 GPA minimum in the other

The Un.iversity of California 
Board of Regents decided to post-
pone further iliscussion of its plan 
to use private funding to help pay 
the salaries of 42 top executives 
- a portion of a larger proposal 
concerning the sa laries of uni-
versity employees, addressed in 
September. 

The regents were originally 
supposed to decide on the proposal 
in a meeting this week. Ilowever, 
in a kner to fellow IXlard melll-
hers, Regent Judith Ilopkinson 

announced that the private-fi.lIlding 
plan would be postponed until fi.lr-
ther notice due to concerns that it 
would overshadow more important 
parts of the propo~al. 

The rest of the propmition

A study recently released by 
'Science Watch: the newsletter of 
Thomson Scientific, ranked UCSD 
as the fifth-best institution for 
research in economics and busi-
ness over the last decade. UCSD 
was the only UC campus to be 
ranked in the top 10. The number 
of papers and citations published 
and cited in the field of economics 
and business determined the rank-
ings. Other ranked schools includ-
ed Harvard University, Stanford 
University and Princeton University, 
which ranked second, eighth and 
ninth, respectively. 

Community college 
students still lagging 

speeds. . 
The service had been the sub-

ject of scrutiny after the Recording 
Industry Association of America 
threatened the network with legal 
action in September. The RIM 
claimed that the network assisted in 
student piracy and copyright infringe-
ment 

The entertainment industry'S legal 
hand was bolstered this summer by 
a U.s. Supreme Court ruling that 
said peer-to-peer networks could not 
encourage or "induce' piracy' in any 
way without risking legal liability. 

Because of legal circumstances, 
i2Hub founder Wayne Chang declined 
to comment on the shutdown to any 
media sources. The only sign of 
the shut down is on the network's 
Web site, where the only messages 
posted are "R.I.P. 11. 14.2005' and 
' remember i2Hub.'

Although community college 
students who are labeled "high 
nsk' are more engaged inside and 
outside of the dassroom, they are 
still low achievers, according to 
the Community College Survey of 
Student Engagemen~ conducted by 
researchers at the University of Texas 
at Austin. 

That group includes minorities, 
first-generation college students and 
those without good academic prepa-
ration. In the repo~ composed of 
surveys of 133,281 students from 
257 colleges in 38 states, research-
ers found that high-risk students are 
also the most likely to be engaged 
in their studies, which the study 
defined as being more likelv to come 
to class prepared, more rrequendy 
interactive With Instructors outside of 
class and more likely to use support 
services. 

SRTV moves Web

Still, those students receive lower 
grades and have higher dropout 
rates. In addition, more high-risk stu-
dents did not expect to graduate 
compared to their low-risk counter-
parts, according to the report. The 
study also found that only about half 
of all community college students 
retum for a second year of commu-
nity college. 

College file-sharing 
network shuts down 

The i2Hub network used to sWap 
files on college campuses thrOUgh 
high-speed downloading of movies, 

The Intemet site was shut down 
Nov. 4, when the AS Council pulled 
the station's signal and when AS. 
Commissioner of Student Services 
Maurice Junious said he could not 
trust the managers to I isten to his 
orders or keep watch over the sta-
tion. 

Junious was given ultimate pur-
view over the stanon by a council bill 
passed on Nov. 2. When Junious and 
AS. President Christopher Sweeten 
requested that the station be reacti-
vated on Nov. 7, acting Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of Student Life Gary R. 
Ratcliff refused the reque~ citing a 
need for more council control over 
SRlV before it could be retumed 
to the air. Since then, both the Web 
site and the station's television signal 
have been down, according to SRlV 
engineer Alex Miller. 

The new Web site is http.!/WNN. 
srtvonline.com, and will contain up-
to-date material on the station and 
the council's efforts to bring the sta-
tion back to regular the air. 

NOTICE TO ADVERTISERS 

THE UCSD 

continued from fJa€e I 
ing be provided by fee increases. 
These include improvements in 
student-to-faculty ratio, as well as 
salary increases for UC faculty and 
staff, Poorsina said. 

"We till have serious ongo-
ing funding gaps," UC President 
Robert C. D ynes stated in a press 
rel ease. "Make no mistake: This 
university's quality, and the magni-
tude of this universi[)7's contribu-
tion to Califo rni a, are sti ll at risk 
today." 

Despite these fee increases, 
Ca lifo rnia sti ll holds a high posi-
tion compared to other public 
univers ity sy terns in providing 
affordabl e higher education. After 
the increases, UC fees will still 
remain an estimated $900 per year 
below the average cost of other 
public universities, according to 
Poorsina . 

"Increases in student fees are 
necessary to preserve the quality 
of the student educationa l experi-
ence," Poorsina said.

increases have been far from posi-
tive, with a number of UCSD 
students, which was coordinated 
by A.S. Vice President External 
Samanatha Peterson, traveling to 
the Nov, 17 Berkeley meeting to 
protest the fee increases. 

Srudent groups are still disput-
ing the fee hikes, including the 
U niversity of California Students 
Association, which spearheaded a 
"March to Stop the Fee Hikes" at 
UC Berkeley. 

In order to cope with predicted 
fee increa es, th e university is also 
considering increases to funding 
of financial aid programs. The ai d 
would account for 33 percent of 
the new revenues generated by the 
increases in student fees , accord-
ing to Poorsina. 

"This proposal, in conjunc-
tion with the Cal Grant program, 
would provide enough additional 
funding to provide for the UC's 
eligible students," Poorsina said.

I A.S. COUNCIL AT A GLANCE 
A-S, Meeting ~n J - Nov. ] 6 

Public Input 
California Public Interest Research 

Croup Campus Coo rdinator Kirsten 
Schatz, announced that the organiza-
tion is planning a Gulf region hur-
ric:ane relief nip ovcr winter break. 
Volunt ers who embark on the nip 
will be housed and fed through dona-
tions, and fundraising for tnmsporta-
tion to the region is to begin soon. 

Student-Run Tclevi ion co-
Manager Andrew Tess addressed the 
dcmands made by acting Assistant 
Vice C hancellor of Srudent Life 
Gary R. Ratcliff in o rd er to have the 
service turned back on. 

lIe urged the council to look at 
the ol;ginal SRTV charter passed 
in 1996 because he believes it best 
reflects the intent of the station as an 
organi7..ation. 

"S ignificant changes made by the 
administration [arc] tantamount to 
censorship at this point," he said. 

E.ddie G uerrero, from the Snldent 
Affirmative Action Comm ittee, 
spoke out against what he believed 
to be "an unfair proccss and sclec-
tion" of the vice president external. 
lie alleged that everal applications 
were left unguarded in Price Center 
third floor lobby, and that one per-
son of the two-member selection 
committee arrived late to his inter-
\1ew. LI e C'J ll ed for .S. President 
Christopher weeten to reopen and 
adapt the applic:ation process. 

Items of Immediate 
Consideration 
Item A 

The cowlci l rejected a resolution 
valjdating the petitions that called 
for the A.s. Council to hold a specia l 
election regarding council rC/,rula-

tions of SRTV content. Sweeten 
announced that he had certified the 
petitions and the election would take 
place. The resol u tion was deemed 
unnecessary. 

Reports 
President Christopher Sweeten 

Sweeten said that the specia l 
election ca lled by " Koala TV" peti-
tioners will take place the first week 
of winter quarter. lie referenced 
the administration's refusal to return 
SRTV to operational status as "a slap 
in the face to not only the council , 
but the student body as a whole." 

Old Business 

Item A 
Fonner Interim Vice President 

E.xterna l Samantha Peterson was 
approved for the pemlanent position 
despite ca lls from certain members 
of the public to reopen applications 
for her position. Peterson's appoint-
ment was pas ed by consensu . 

Item L 
Councilmembers debated 

whether or not ro amend the cha r-
ter of the A.S. Judicial Board to 
allow for the cou ncil to be notified 
wh en a grieva nce is filed against 
it. Although A.S. Commissioner 
of Student Advocacy Travi s Silva 
and his predecessor Denis Shmidt 
argued that open hearings could 
inhibit the ability of issues to be 
seltled outside of the Ju dicial 
Board, many senators said they 
believed that the right of the coun-
ci l as an accused party superseded 
the desire to keep the charges from 
being leaked to the media.

Pay: Plan's opponents decried its focus 
conlinued from page I 

efi ts exceed market medians, making 
the total about average. One part of 
the plan would increase UC salaries 
to a competitive level ove r the next 
10 years. The second section dealt 
with the Illanner in which salaries 
are decided, including srrengthening 
the level of control that regents have 
over the salaries of senior leaders. 

The postponed section of the 
proposal would have allowed the 
university to use private funding to 
augmcnt the salaries of any of the 
42 cligi ble positions currently paid 
m ore than $350,000. Currentl y, 
eight of these positions are eligible 
for this fonn of payment, although 
this number would mo t likely 
in crease if the first part of the pro-
posal would take eftect. 

A wave of hosti li ty followed the 

release of the compensation propos-
al in September, particularly the use 
of private funding. The university 
received a great deal of criticism for 
itS propos.ll to usc private monics 
for a public university, especially 
because the funds would be going to 
the roll-caming executives. 

" I would aff,rue that our fl.lndrais-
iJlg priority hould be support for 
students, research support and capi-
tal money to build buildings," for-
mer prt'Sident of the C Academic 
Council George Blulllenthal said. 

Despite these statements, the 
regents decided to postpone dis-
cussions of private funding for 
salaries due to "significant opposi-
tion ," according to chair of the C 
Aaldemic Council Clifford Bnmk. 

The focus by the opponents of 
thC proposal has mainly been on UC 

leaders' o;alaric because tllCV arc the 
only ones that would be affected by 
tile proposal for private funding. 

"[The average sa la ry on faculty 
is behind by 12 percent and ~taff is 
well behind, and yet the only people 
who would be affected h private 
funding arc tile senior administra-
tion," Blutllenthal said. 

Ilowever, C spokesperson 
ocl Van Nyhuis described the plan 

as having other goa ls. 
"[The proposall only deals widl 

hrinf,ring :111 UC salaries (0 market 
comparability ... and with how part 
of thesc salaries of some Icadcr;hip 
positions could be funded widlOut 
relying solely on state funding," Van 

yhuis said.

Athlete: Plan requires 3.2 GPA standard 
conrinued from page I 

grants-in-aid proposal. In addi-
tion, c1ibrible athletes would have 
to have had a high school GPA of 
3.5, accordi ng to 1999 Thurgood 
Marshall College alumn us, fornlcr 
A.S. President J oseph Lev3nthal, 
who proposed the scholarship and 
is a part of the committee. 

Under the proposal, the Alumni 
Association would use funds pre-
viously allocated for sponsoring 
th e National Merit Scholarship 
Program, which the association can 
00 ~~r~pporta~rtheUC 
system widlClrew its participation 
inJuly 2005 . 

" I think the propos:11 address-
es many of the concerns of past 
ath letic scho larship proposal s," 
Levanthal stated in an c-mail. "For 
example, this proposal requires sru-
dent athletes to maintain a 3.2 CPA, 
which is higher than UCSD's over-
all undergraduate average. Also, 

the scholarship would be awarded 
based on academies, not athletic 
abi lity. I also think the lumni 
Association is a nanlral parmer with 
athletics, as athletics is often what 
keeps srudents connected to their 
undergraduate university long after 
graduation." 

This allows the aid to be an aCJ-
demic scholarship with an athletic 
component radler than primarily 
an athletic scholarship - a kind 
of merit schola rship tile Alumni 
Association should he inter-
ested in supporti ng, according to 
Levanthal. 

A.S. Commissioner of thleties 
Anna Ahlin sa id dl3t she thinks the 
proposal is an excellent way to push 
ath letes to be better students , in 
order to be eligible for the money. 
This would all eviate concerns 
raised by members of the Academic 
enute at its meeting in pring 

that offering ,Ith letic scholarships is 

against UCSD's 3C'Jdemic spirit. 
The Alumni Association's !>chol-

arship committee will discuss a 
number of options, and talk!. arc 
likely to continue over a few weeks, 
according toJohn \ 'alva, the a~.,oc i ­
ation '5 executive director. Valva said 
dlat the committee will aim to have 
a decision read}' by tnid-Fehruary. 

Scholarship Committee Chair 
Sheldon Engelhom .,aid that the 
Alumni ssociation has a ,Trong 
interest in supporting an academic 
merit program. 

"Over the next few months, \\(.: 
will be dio;cussing how \\c ~hould 
modify (Jur prognltn," ~:ngclhorn 
st::1ted in an e-mail. "A~ we have 
just begun the process, we haven 't

fit into the program and no pecific 
proposals have yet been di'iCu <;sed."

later, with the president's 
approval rating at a dismal 
36 percent and polls show-
ing that Americans increas-
ingly lack confidence in his 
once-signature strengths, 
the wisdom of that sup-
posed mandate is growing 
hazy. 

Bush's recent behavior 
has only served to exacer-
bate our doubts about his 
plan for a successful (read: 
possible) finale to the war 
in Iraq. At a Veterans Day 
speech last week, Bush 
dusted off his old "war crit-
ics are unpatriotic" attack 
on those - increasingly 
from his own party - who 
want some much-needed 
honesty from the We~t 
Wing as the war approach-

es its third year. Bush's jab 
was nothing if not a cheap 
shot, and its severely poor 
timing rightly earned Bush 
another tumble in the pub-
lic's confidence. 

His speech's attack on 
"revisionist historians" fell 
equally flat in the midst of 
boiling controversy - and 
ever ambiguity - over his 
original justification for the 
war. Though it hasn't been 
proven yet that Bush him-
self lied, his central claims 
for the urgency of the Iraq 
mission have all but vapor-
ized: No weapons of mass 
destruction and no func-
tioning nuclear weapons 
program were found. 

Once again, the president 
has his temlS confused. It is 
not revisionist history that 
is being written, it is actual 
history - and unless his 
superficial attacks suddenly 
find a note of sincerity, it is 
a good bet that those his-
tories will not look kindly 
on him. 

UC system next up for 
a transparency scandal 
T he University of California , as a public university, 
should always pursue a pol-
icy of public transparency. 

But it has taken a series of 
articles by the San Frm7cisco 
Cbronicle to reveal that the 
university has been lavish-
ing its top staffers with $871 
million in bonuses on top 
of reguJar pay. Incidentally, 
this is more than enough 
cash to cover the 79-percent 
fee increase students have 
borne the past few years. 

Surely these expensive 
perks dwarf the deals that 
top brass at private univer-
sities enjoy. It is also true 
that the university must stay 
competitive in tenns of com-
pensation if it wants to keep 
the best people and its repu-
tation as a top institution. 

But it i disturbing that 
tllese bonuses were kept 
secret. For financially 
pinched students, the uni-
versity's lack of disclosure 
looks that much worse. 

University administrators 
surely have their reasons for 
the bonuses; many are so 
simple, they're intuitive: the 
marketdemands high salaries 
for top employees that make 
the UC as prestigious as it 
is. But letting a newspaper 
expose pay practices is never 
a good strategy, especially 
since a public university has 
a duty to pursue a policy of 
full public disclosure. UC 
President Robert C. Dynes, 
for example, complained in 
an e-mail that "the Chronicle 
omitted or mischaracter-
ized some important facts" 
- that wouldn't have hap-
pened if the university was 
forthcoming in the first 
place. 

But now the university 
has been caught stea ling 
from the cookie jar - its 
own and its students'. Now 
it has some explaining to 
do, especially if the regents 
intend to push for more 
benefits, as the current fee 
increase suggests.

T here is a reason that cof-feehouses thrive, papers are completed and the 
human lifespan is voluntari ly 
shortened: due dates. Not JUSt 
any due dates, but the type that 
require an entire night's worth of 
sleepless, driven work. 

Before haughty eyebrows can 
rise a la skeptical Scully of the 
long deceased "X-Files," I should 
mention that when this topic 
came up in past conversations, 
my roommate had an interesting 
point to make: 

"I most certain ly never missed 
a night's sleep over work," she 
told me. "I don't see how, with 
all those due dates printed on the 
syllabus and all. I mean, you've 
had weeks. What's your excuse?" 

Plenty. The first being, of 
course, that I'm a big, fat pro-
crastinator. But, at the moment, 
that's beside the point. In essence, 
I've found that there are people 
who choose their own schedules, 
and those who let their schedu les 
choose them. While she's bcen 
able to manhandle classes and 
work into a rigid grid, I've had 
far less luck, which, surprisingly, 
doesn't revolve entirely around 
my curious neglect of syllabi. 

However, this isn't a dime-a-
doren article on resolving your 
scheduling differences. We'U slcip 

ahead of the would-be counseling, 
which can be pretty costly, judg-
ing from what I've learned about 
behavior modification. Did you 
mow therapists heal procrastina-
tion by taking your things and 
never giving them back? Week 
after week, but only if you don't 
change, that is. You pay them 
to act like an elementary school 
teacher - step out of line, and 
mister, that fun-filled, shiny iPod 
is going in to the drawer hoard 'til 
the day this school is bulldozed. 
Maybe the repo guys are helping 
people heal, too, you mow, from 
property problems. And, I'm get-
ting sidetracked. 

The cure to all academic woes 
can be found working that mid-
night oil. It's not healthy - in 
fact, you may pass out during 
your midterm from sheer exhaus-
tion - but it gets the job done. 
I'm all for being robust and 
whatnot, but I'm also a fan of not 
stari ng at a Scantron and filling 
in bubbles to make interesting 
patterns. Follow me on my quest 
as I go about this the right way, 
and perhaps learn a little more 
about the adopted home we all 
call UCSD. 

First of all, I suggest that 
the enterprising studier stock up 
on coffee and snacks when pos-
sible. On campus, Plaza on the 
Side is open until midnight, and 
Oceanview Terrace and Earl's 
Place are open until 1 a.m., so 
please, please take advantage 
of your meal points and get 
your consumer goods here and 
now. I'm not saying you should 
become a raving, overhyped caf-
feine addict - yet. But it's good 

to have such things on reserve. 
In fact, it is my opinion that 
you should delay on the coffee 
because T can vouch that starting 
too soon (or ever) on that sug-
ared bliss without sleep will burn 
you out far quicker than neces-
sary. Caffeine and sugar burnout 
are painful things corne morning, 
with the headaches, aching tired-
ness and light sensitivity, so I'd 
avoid coffee unless your work 
is heartless, banal drudgery and 
leads to missing-time syndrome. 
However, if push comes to shove, 
don't be a wimp and do what you 
need to do. Also, remember to 
have a pair of sunglasses on you . 
You 'll see why in about eight 
hours. 

Secondly, the UCSD libraries 
close ridiculously early. Outside 
of finals week, all libraries on 
campus lock their doors no later 
than I a.m. The outrage! Why, 
in Korea, libraries are not only 
open 24 hours, but they provide 
beds and showers, too .. . nothing 
like a 2417 brain powwow com-
mune to get the creative juices 
flowing. However, back in the 
States, I'm only halfway through 
my paper/lecture notcslbook, and 
I've already been kicked out of 
a srudious environment. What's 
left for me to do? Turn tail and 
run back to my apartmenf, where 
the slightest tap of a keyboard 
brings the wrath of roommates 
down upon my head? The place 
where a bed stands alluringly in 
the darlcened corner of my room, 
beckoning me' to turn off the 
puny lamp and just go to sleep?

Debate over petitions reveals the 
weaknesses of the A.S. Council 
By MARIANNE MADDEN 

Opinion Editor 

Petitions are funny things. People love to sign them. But voting in the elections 
they call up is another matter 
entirely. 

For example, even "Koala TV" 
and Student-Run Television affil-
iates found gathering more than 
2,600 tudcnt signatures in five 
days a snap. Who wouldn't, when 
the petition is skillfully framed as 
a vote for free speech on campus? 

The fact is that signing a peti-
tion takes little effort and less 
commitment. Those students who 
gathered signarures like to brag 
that more than 90 percent of the 
students they approached signed, 
yet gathering signatures is no 
harder than giving out free food 
on Library Wall" Ninety percent 
of students will happily obUge, 
no questions asked; the other 10 
percent are paranoid cynics. 

So the signature-gatherers 
handed out their delicious bites 
of participatory democracy, and 
just over the required J 0 percent 
of UCSD undergrads ate it up. 
It's not the mind-boggling man-
date that some signature-gather-
ers make it out to be, but it' 
something. 

But will our attention waver 
before the special election even 
comes to pass during the first week 
of winter quarter? The RTV 
debacle effectively caprured sru-
dents' attention - but it was 
fleeting. Only a few remain com-
mitted to their quest to overturn 
the A.S. Council's decision and 
tum the station back on . Most of 
these students are SRTV affiliates 
or "KoaJa TV" participants left 
with nothing to do as the station 
remains off the air. 

While their mission is noble, 
orne long-term thinking is neces-

sary. This same crisis erupted last 
year, sans SRTV tum-off, and last 
year this paper advocated a careful 

rewrite of SRTV's charter. A.S. 
Commissioner of Srudent Affairs 
Maurice Junious' rewrite of the 
charter this year showed a sneaky 
unilateralism that doesn't fly; the 
charter must be rewritten to the 
satisfaction of both SRTV man-
agers and the A.S. Council. Such 
a peaceful solution will be tricky 
and will require some compro-
mise; but if the station wants long-
term viability and to avoid furure 
switch-offs, it's crucial. 

While it's at it, the council 
might want to clarify and amend 
the portion of its constitution 
governing petitions, too. 

" [T]he A, S. Council 
has obsessed over 

'what students want' 
throughout the entire 
debate, and now it's 
clear: They want a 
special election and 
a direct say in the 
future of SR1V, " 

The current ruJes governing 
petitions are vague, opening the 
door to all sorts of challenges that 
could stall or block the special elec-
tion. For example, some council-
members attempted to argue that 
the signarures were irtvalid wi thout 
pm number . This is a silly argu-
ment, as candidates for council 
aren 't even required to supply their 
pm numbers to run, but the point 
is that the constitution is weak in 
areas sud\ as this and must be clari-
fied so obstinate members of the 
A.S. Council , like Commissioner 
of Srudent Advocacy Travis Silva, 

can't threaten to block petitions 
on technicalities for fear of their 
impact. 

ThankJully, the council has 
decided to smother its urge to 
stall the special election: Sweeten 
announced during the ov. 16 
meeting that he verified the peti-
tion and the special election will 
indeed occur. 

The councilmembers must do 
everything in their power to pro-
mote this special election. To do 
anything else would mean politi-
cal suicide for a council already 
considered by many srudents to be 
filled with pampered, stuffY moral-
ists who are completely divorced 
from the needs and wants of their 
constituents. 

For all its hand wringing and 
infighting over what constituents 
want, the AS. Council handled this 
petition poorly. Sure, it's an injury 
to one's ego when students beat 
down the door to protest a decision 
the council thought was best and 
then deliver a stack of thousands of 
signatures calling for their own say. 

But, more importantly, the 
A.S. Counci l has obsessed over 
"what srudents want" through-
out this entire debate, and now 
it's clear: They want a special 
election and a direct say in the 
furure of SRTV. Whether stu-
dents uphold or strike down the 
A.S . Council's decision is impos-
sible to say, because no matter 
how "free speech" crusaders try to 
spi.n it, the 2,600 signatures were 
in support of a special election, 
not necessarily in favor of striking 
down the council's decision. 

The election could go either 
way, but the main mission is to get 
it out of the way as soon as pos-
sible, before srudents lose interest. 
Then SRlV and the A.S. Council 
can sit down and hammer out a 
revised charter for the station.

roaring success of the signarure-

~ I LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Petitions are about free 
speech, not free porn 

Dear Editor, 
After re,](ling your article, 

"Thousands approve call for spe-
cial election ," in the ov. 14 
issue, I was struck by one com-
ment in particular. You quote 
Vice President External Samantha 
Peterson, exclaiming that she has 
a hard time believing that 2,600 
students want to ee John Muir 
College senior Steve York have 
sex . M iss Peterson seems to be 
under the impression that th e 
2,600 signatories signed the peti-
tion out of a desire to see Mr. York 
copulate on-screen. 

I think th is comment reveals 
the gross misunderstanding many 
people, including Peterson, seem to 
have of this situation. Support for 
the special election petition or for 
Student-Run Television's return is 
being lampooned as nothing more 
than the desire of wayward porn 
addicts who want to see more nudi-
ty on television . Rather than being 
recognized a primarily a defense of 
free speech , and an objection to the 
A.S. Council's capricious exercise 
of power, many individuals would 
prefer to marginalize these words 
of protest by insinuating that they 
are simply based on a desire to 
observe sexua I acts. 

I personally think Mr. York's 
segment was rather unappealing, 
and I find his actions disagreeable 
on evera l counts, including, but 
not limited to, the lack of prophy-
lactics and his choice in women. 
However, J strongly support free-

dom of speech and recognize that 
my personal distaste for an idea or 
action does not justify censoring it. 
Thjs is an important concept that 
certain members of the A.S. Counci I 
and the UCSD administration do 
not seem to grasp. Furthermore, I 
wish to remind Peterson and others 
that defending an individual 's right 
to freedom of expression does not 
necessarily entail support for that 
particular viewpoint or acti on. The 
protests of many of the petition 
signatories arc based on a pas ion 
for defending the principles that 
allow for a diversity of ideas and for 
countering what is seen as a rash 
decision based on personal whims 
rather than a careful and objective 
analysis of the issue.

You can save up on your laptop

cuntinued from page 5 
gatherers have made one thing 
clear: The A.S. Council faces a 
serious legi timacy problem with 
students. The council's decision to 
come down on the side of censor-
ing SRTV certainly didn't help 
its image either. If it weren't for 
the A.S. Council's initiation of its 
shutdown, SRTV might still be on 
the air - and even 

" 

it's a complaint tinged with hypoc-
risy. Low voting numbers made the 
council what it is. 

If students aCnJally cared 
came .election time, the moralists, 
brownnosers, nepotists and wan-
nabe administrators that plague the 
counci l wouldn't win easy elections 
and re-elections. And more impor-
tantly, the council would, or at least 

be able to claim to, 
represent snJelents. if the council's rea-

sons for the shur-
down were as good 
as gold, that's all 
snJdents focus on. 

The real disas-
ter here is that tile 
A.S. Council is 
damned if it does 
and damned if it 
doc n't. First of all, 
it is charged with 
representing a pool 
of snJdents who, 
for the most part, 
didn't bother to 
vote for or agai nst 
it, and councilmem-
hers sa iled to hollow 
victories or more 
hollow appoint-
ments. 

If it weren't for the 
A.S. Council's 

One could argue 
that this council was 
drawn from a pool 
of lack.luster can-
didates, which may 
well be true. But 
it's moot consid-
ering that, regard-
less, very few stu-
dents tOok the ini-
tiative to aCnJully 
vote, and now a 
much larger pool 
of students have 
risen in opposition 
to the council's 

actions vis-ii-vis 
SRTV. The num -
ber of students who 
signed the petition 
is more than twice 
the 1,4 16 sn,dents 

initiation of its 
shutdown, SR1V 

might stiU be on the 
air - and even if 

the council's reasons 
far the shutdown 

were good as gold, 
that's all students

the council makes 

fi " OCUS on. 
popular decisions - like keeping 
SRTV on the air the first time 
this pornography crisis erupted, 
or letting this special election go 
forward given the current circum-
stances - students simply ignore 
them. Making unpopular decisions, 
on the other hand, elicits insults, 
threats and cries that the council 
lacks legitimacy. 

Only 19.9 percent of students 
bothered to vote in last April's 
student government elections, so 
when snJdcnts complain about a 
lame or illegitimate A.S. Council, 

who elected A.S. 
President Chris Sweeten, for 
exa mple - and even morc than 
the 2,510 votes Vice President of 
Academic Affairs [larry Khanna 
garnered. Khanna ran unopposed. 

Do students who didn't bother

. SRTV: J. .. Board to hear Watts' case Nov. 21 

Billy Wong/Guardian 

Mixed messages: A sign asks, 'Are we a pom nation! in Price Center. The judicial board will hear multiple cases regarding SRTV. 
continued from page I 

moving forward with a special elec-
tion, forced by a petition signed by 
over 2,600 students. Sweeten certi-
fi ed the petition ea rlier this week, 
and plans to bring the petition to 
a vote, which could overrurn the 
council's decisions to ban sCXlIal 
forms of nudity and John Muir 
College senior Steve York from the 
station. 

.S. Commissioner of Uldent 
Advocac.y Travis Silva has decided 
not to pursue a grievance that would 
have addressed concerns of students 
who wcre "hara 'sed" by gatherers 
of the petition. 

The grievance would have been 
filed with the A.S. Judicial Board 
if enough snJdents were willing to 
testilY to intimidation tactics on the 
part of petition gatherers, Silva said. 

Silva dcnjed any confl ict of 
interest, a topic brought up by sev-
eral councilmembers, between his 
position as student advocate and 
a member of the A.S. Council. 
However, former Student Advocate 
Denis Shrnidt disagreed that the 
position could not legislate when 
necessary. 

"Student advocates do what is in 
the best interest of the students," 
Shmidt said. "I don't believe this 
is in any way .illegal. People may 
debate whether or not it's right, but 
it's not illegal." 

York said that allegations of mis-
conduct are the result of a personal 
vendetta by Silva. 

"Travis Silva is simply acting as 
the judge, clerk, jury and trainer of 
the courts. It's just another attempt 
for A.S. to get in the way of democ-
racy," York said. 

In addition, the Judicial Board 
will hear other grievances, filed 
separately by John 1uir College 
senior Steve York and Earl Warren 

ollege . enior Daniel WattS, who 
both accuse the council of mis-
conduct in passing legislation that 
banned York and sexua l fonns of 
nudity from the station. 

At the ov. 9 council meeting, 
Watts pre ented the council with 
the aforementioned petition, which 
mandated that the election be held 
within 15 academic days. 

York's grievance, designed to 
invalidate the Oct. 23 special meet-
ing in which the pornography ban 
was passed, and the subsequent 
amendments to the SRTV charter, 
has yet to be ruled on. Ilowever, it 
docs not address the council's deci-
sion to ban York and "Koala TV" 
from the SRTV station. 

As for Watts, his request for a 
temporary restraining order against 
the A.S. Council from handling 
affair related to SRTV was denied. 
However, he said he does not view 
the rejection as a major setback to

his goal of overrurning the council's 
decisions. 

"The petition and special e lec-
tion I keep) A .. from doing any-
thing else related to SRTV," Watts 
said. "So, the denial of the order 
dot:sn 't reallv matter, because they 
accomplish the same thlng." 

However, Silva views Watts' 
claim in a different light. 

"TIle A . . Judicial Board found 
that Watts' complaint had no prob-
able cause of being true and declined 
to issue a temporary restraining 
order," Silva said. "I am confident 
that theJudicial Board will continue 
to show the nJdent body that A.S. 
is acting both according to its rules 
and acting to keep SRTV on the 
air." 

The Judicial Board will hear 
another grievance by ""atts, where 
he claims that the station was ille-
gally 'hut down by the council. 
The open hearing is scheduled for 
Nov. 21. 

In addition, the council appoint-
ed several members to the SRTV. 
Task Force, which will rewrite the 
station's charter, including Shmidt, 
Vice President of Academic Affairs 
r larry Khanna, Revelle Senior 

en3tOr Rachel Corell and Muir

(Daniel Radcliffe) turns 14 and goes PG- 13 in thc 
adaptation of J.K. Rowling's fourth tome, "The 
Goblet of Fire," and le t's face it: Adolescence is 
fun . Well, at least fun to watch . 

Thc latcst installment centers on the Tri-
Wizard Tournament, pitting I larry, an unwilling 
contestant, against three older, bolder kids in a 
series of hnardous tasks invulving fierce dragons, 
!,'Tumpy sea creatures and never-ending mazes. But 
the dazzling visual effects aren 't dizzying, for once, 
letting the emutional charge lead the way through 
an action-packed 157 minutes worth of film that 
feels about half as long. 

Snippets of teenage tribulations help keep the 
film apace; the dragons may fly high, but the hor-
moncs run higher. I larry and pal Ron Weasley 
(Rupert Grint) sport shaggy haircuts and aloof 
postures, the latter of which probably weren ' t too 
much of a stretch for the young actors. (But worry 
not, you'll be spared the acne; digital "spot rem ov-
ing" was said to have been used to clear up some 
skin problems in post-production.) 

A..~ I larry and his classmates prepare for the 
big Yule ball, Ilogwarts School of Witchcraft and 
Wizardry turns into any other high school before 
the prom. llarry waits too long to ask his crush 
Cho Chang (Katie Leung), and Ron finds himself a 
blubbering fool before J lerrnione Granger (Emma 
Watson), who he suddenly sees in an all -new light 
(surprise, surprise). Add to all that a falling-out 
between best friends and teasing by the whole 
school, and Harry's already got a lot on his plate 
without having to also prepare for the tournament 
and confront the looming return of hjs arch-nem-
esis Lord Voldemort (played by an unrecogni7..able 
but superbly creepy Ralph Fiennes). 

Throughout this difficult timc, the new Defense 
o f the Dark Arts professor, Mad-Eye Moody 
(Brendan Gleeson), is assigned to "kcep an eyc" on 
I larry. The cX'uberant, irritable glass-eyed char-
acter is the best new addjtion to an already fine 
cast, with returning greats including the likes of

McGonagall). W e get some musical cameos, too 
- the kids on ly dance to boring music for the req-
uisite ballroom scene before rocking to the sounds 
of a magically-conjured wizard band composed of 
none other than Pulp'S Jarvis Cocker as the lead 
singer and Radiohcad 'sjOlUlY Greenwoud and Phil 
Selway on guitar and drums, respectively. Did you 
expect any less from Hogwarts? 

But for all the fun, "Gubler of Fire" is still the 
darkest chapter of the Potter films yet. "Prisoner of 
Azkaban" directo r Alfonso Cuaron vastly improved 
the se ries with his gloomier adaptation, and new 
director Mike ewell ("Four Weddings and a 
Funeral"), the first British director to sign on to 
this oh-5O- British franchise, continues in the same 
brooding vein, upping the focus on the characters' 
inner turmoil. 

This translates into much more face time 
with our main man , with Radcliffe rising to the 
moment as a rather nuanced, turbulent LJarry in 
the throes of ever-more-imminent danger. On 
hooting th e fourth Potter book, ewell has been 

quoted as aying tllat "children are violent, dirty, 
corrupt anarchists. Just adults-in-waiting basi-
cally." And while our protagonists are perhaps a 
little above-average, ewell sticks to his guns and 
paints tllem as complex as tile autbor intended 
them to be - evcn hero Harry flirts with the dark 
side for a modicum of a second . If the actors and 
directors keep growing in quality as the characters 
grow up, what a treat the ncxt few films will be 
(though don't expect the rating to shoot up to R 
anytime soon). 

Yet wand-wielding, die-hard I-larry Potter fans 
should brace themselves. "The Goblet of Fire" 
was, at 734 pages, quite a hefty novel to adapt. 
While the studio originally thought to split it up 
into two films, Newel l decided against the idea, 
instead cutting out much of the subplots. Gone is 
much of the introduction; gone are the Durs leys; 
the Quidditch World Cup game is skipped over; 
and most of all , the story of Barty Crouch and his 
son is hugely down played (their house elf doesn't 
even make the cur). 

This unfortunately undercuts the political 
undertones found in Row ling's story, but an amaz-
ing amOUllt was packed in as it is, and the result is a 
taut, thrilling grown-up tale, Simply encha nting.

In de dink: Curtis 'Fitty Cent" Jackson re-enacts his intrepid past as a drug pusher turned inmate turned hip-
hop star in 'Get Rim or Die Tryin': which shows 50 Cent turning to music for the love of money. 

By SIMONE WILSON 
Contributing Writer 

What is it about reigning G- Unit king Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson that keeps us coming I:rdck for more? Could it be his 
hypnotizing, monotone tales of dirty sex and 
counting cash? Or hi nine legendary bullet 
wounds carved in solid, tattooed gangsra mus-
cle? Perhaps it's the notion that at any minute 
50 could be victim to a pack of angry business 
parmers from his ghetto days. Whatever ir is, 
his fans are eating it up Jjkc candy. 

ow, on top of two multiplatinum record, 
a clothing line and more M1V ai.rtime than 
the rest of his competition combined, 50 Cent 
has decided to take on Hollywood and expose 
the dramatic past whose lyrical references have 
so far uphe ld his thug reputation. "Get Rich or 
Die Tryin'" (iwned after 50's first album and 
~ by Jim _~~.9J.n_ of"1n A1perica) rells 
alf)ry3fa ~sJack'sOn, a6ruidoned 
by his father and tragically parted from his 
mother upon her brutal murder. Crowded and 
pepniless conditions at his grandparents' house 
soon whet Jackson's appetite for fortune, so he 
tums to street dealing' for some quick cash. 

A few crack crystals and bloody sidewalks 
later, the game catches up with a now-street 
seasoned Jackson and he is put behind bars. It 
is in prison that the future rap superstar meets 
his comic-relieving manager Bam3 (rerrcnce

Howard), who sees promise somewhere in 50's 
flat rhymes and forever converts him from a 
life of crime to a life of rhyme. 

It's all too easy to compare 50's silver screen 
debut with Eminem's autobiographical "SMile" 
- each, with the help of a very un-hip-hop but 
previously successful dramatic director, depicts 
an adversity-ehallenged rap ta lent who rises 
from rags to riches by pursuing his dream. But 
there is one significant difference: Eminem's 
film is jam packed with skillful, high-inten-
sity freestyles and an obvious love for his craft, 
whereas 50 (though undeniably harder than 
Em) pursues a hip-hop career mainly becausc 
it's a afer and higher-paying route to success. 

Aside from a few X-rated verses he writes 
for childhood crush Charlene (later his baby's 
mama, played by joy Bryant), the then-dubbed 
"Yowlg Caesar" never really devotes any time 
to his art and instead obsessively fixates on the 
cash Aow. Ilis success as a hip-hop artist is 
almost a side note to apparently more impor-
tant things, like how many time he's bee n 
shot. Sadly, fans will probably be too immersed 
in his dumb stare and buUetproof vest to take 
thi blatant clue that their icon can't really rap 
(or act, for that matter) and is basically here to 
suck every last quarter out of their pockets. 

I f you insist on contributing to his cause, bis 
film docs have irs highlights. lie delivers some 
chuckle-worthy disses and a surprising booty 
shot a la prison shower fight. You got to give it 
to him - he knows how to make money. I fate 
it or luve it, this is 50's world, and we're JUSt 
living in it.

The story of the year for hip-hop has been the explosion of Houston 's rap scene in the Illainstream market. Mike Jones and his 
Swishahousc crew receive much of the credit, 
although it is really due to pioneers the Geto 
Boys, and lesser known UCK, composed of 
Bun B and his incarct!rated parmer, Pimp C. 

While UGK's contributions to hip-hop go 
largely unappreciated outside the South, Bun B

Who would have thought thrce punk-rocking Jews from Brooklyn would become hip-hop legends? Yet the 1986 debut UcellSed

respectable white rap group, though at the time 
it didn't look like they had a long career ahead of 
them. llowever, lit 's follow-up, the spectacularly 
sampled oeuvre Pl//ll's Boutique, was one of the 
most innovative albwns of the '80s. 

Four full -length albums later comes Solid

singles such as "Fight for Your Right" and "IIey

Monk, on the other hand , is as weird as

and arpeggio runs across the keyboard, it's easy 
to see that Monk's concern is creativity, not vir-

not match Coltrane's. But his excess of dissonant 
intervals brings our the dark blue in his signature 
rune. The two giant pcrsonaUties clash in angu-
lar pieces likc "Epistrophy" and "E\~dencc." On 
the latter in particular, the angular conversation 
between Coltranc and Monk is enough for jazz 
enthusiasts to regard this a five-star record.

Witherspoon brings some nice 
touches to june Carter, a figure 
often left in the shadows. 

There arc Illany scenes involv-
ing Cash's drug abuse problems, 
but they rarely get to the crux of 
his turmoil and sadness. The audi-
ence may see the man down some 
pills and alcohol in the back of his 
car or in a dank bathroom, bur in 
Mangold's hands, the urgency is 
lost. This also may be attributcd 
to a so mewhat underwhclming 
performance from Phoenix. lie 
gets the voice and stage move 
down, but never quite grab on 
to the sa intly rebel swagger that 
defines Cash as a popular icon. 

What an opportunity Mangold 
had to peel the skin off the Man in 
Black and tinally depict the god of 
outlaw country music in :111 of his 
glory and pain . It's a shame that 
Mangold was unable to illumi -
nate Cash 10 cement his legendary 
status in the minds of a youngcr

If you're looking for a psy-

A day at camp with the acid-headed Animal Collective 

'RCnf...'Jl'f 
By MYEH KESHMIRI 

Staff Writer 

As a semi-erect adult I seem to dwell on tile pasr tOO often. I miss my younger days of inner monologue, 
where coml1lunjcation was superfluous 
and a luxury at best. I miss the days 
when my senses ruled my consciousness 
with an iron fist, but those days have 
come and gone. 

The adult world is all about under-
standing. It's about arguing, proving and 
outlining every nook and cr:lnny of one's 
self into a museum (Jjsplay for others to 
acknowledge and value, Since the end of 
my youth, every instinctive fo rce of my 
~ou l has been coerced into expressing 
Itself through ultimately limited modes 
uf expression, whether reason, meta-
phor o r numerica l equations. It is only 
through music that I have come to 
rediscover the unutter:lble joys once 
defined by the reaction to the last bell 
every afternoon of elementary school or 
the smell of my mother's hair as it swept 
across my face before my sad departure 
frOIll the nest. 

On their latest release Feels, Animal 
Collective have granted me an echo of 
thosc memories, Picking up where their 
lasr fu ll -length alhul1l SlIug Tongs left off, 
the band members seem to extend their 
holiday retreat away from modernity 
and its conventional mea n~ of discourse 
through nine sonb'S connected hannoni-
ously through the chronological wither-

ing of a sununer's day. 
As the mo rning dew begins to affect 

the splintered wood of the camp's log 
C'dbins, the first track, "Did You See the 
'vVords," bre:Jks the natural silence with 
a fresh breath of laughter. Behind the 
poorly shut mouth of care-free children 
the giggles evolve, first as a whisper, 
then into a communally timed melody 
of chants in Lieu of an orchestrated roll 
ca ll . By the end of the first track, the 
band is unified, fastened and eager to 
take on the wonders of the day. The 
energy sparked at dawn begins to take 
shape in the form of light ambience and 
progressive pop as tlle kjds are accompa-
nied by the counselors' wamlly narrative 
voice, utiljzed for emotive leadership. 

Running out of the serene hanno-
nies of the afternoon, the album begins 
to carelessly lip toward darkly impen-
etrable shades of green hovering at the 
ankles of the campsite's inert timber. 
From the fifth tr:lck to the penultimate, 
Animal Collective's day grows into a 
lost solcmruty of crawling sound and 
eloquently pronounced lyrics. In re -
ognjtion of the ir shared fate they grow 
conscious of their situation and decide 
to participate in the expe.rience rd ther 
than remain perrified in the custody'of 
their i olated elves. 

ight fa lls, and the group ga th-
ers around to sleep on th e backs of 
one another, humbly prepared for the 
unim<lginabl e. For their menta l sake, the 
counselors remain awake as tlle source

Collective decide to create rather than 
end. Survival after aU is deternlined 
from a retrospective experience appJjed 
to the present; therefore having gone 
through the tumultuous peaks and val-

See the Duke 
up close in 
'Richard III' 

By NEHA SINGH 
Senior Staff Writer 

YOU probably haven 't read any-thing by Shakespeare since high school unless you're one of the 
increasingly rare UCSD literature 
majors or had to take one of tho e 
pesky college writing requirement 
classes. Even morc likely, your 
knowledge is limjted to "Romeo 
and Juliet," "Macbeth," ")-]al11let," 
and/or "Taming of the Shrew." But 
with the Old Globe Theatre and th e 
University of San Diego presenting 
a very accessible and impeccably 
directed version of "Richard OJ" at 
the Cassius Carter Centre Stage, 
this is the perfect time to reacquaint 
yourself with the lesser known works 
of the Bard. 

Directo r Sabin E pstein did a 
superb job casting the production. 
Dan I lodge, who play Richard, the 
Duke ofCloucester, effortlessly por-
trays one of literaulrc's most noto-
rious vi ll ai ns. The si multaneous ly 
chamling, conniving and deformed 
character is played with an ease that is 
rarely seen in young <lCtors in tlle;! leI' 
these days. Though Leah Zhang as 
Lady Anne overdramatizes some of 
her lin es and reminds one of a young 
teenager desperately trying to sound 
grown -up, the rest of the actors 
in the Young G lobe Company ,lre 
flawless in their perfonnances. Kate 
Turnbull , in particular, becomes the 
seemingly unlikely heroine of the 
production as the Duchess of York. 
Even some old snoozing couples in 
the audience snapped to attention 
when she fi rst made her entrance 
with a poignant and powerful rebuke 
of her wayward son, the Duke of 
Gloucester, and daughter-in- law, 
Queen Elizabeth. 

Keeping in synch with the design 
of the Cassius Carter Centre Stage at 
the Old Globe, the set and costumes 
are very sparse, ost1J1ne designcr 
Shirley Pierson &rives the asswllp-
tions behind Shakespeare's charac-
ters a twist; the female characters 
retain 18th-century hairstyles and 
plain dresses while the men wear a 
modern assorOllem of evcrytlling 
from biker jackets to nondescript 
suits , The Cassius Carter Centre 
Stage itself is a small , intimate "the-
atre in the round" in which the 
audience sits no more than four rows 
from the stage. Though it allows 
one to view the play from up clo e, 
there are times when watching the 
back of an actor willie Ijsterung to 
hjs lengthy oli loquy gets frustrat-
ing, The mirrors hung up on aU 
four walls of the small tllcater arc 
distorted, wnich makes trying to 
watch the actors at all times futile. 
However, the actors make use of a II 
four exit stairways during the play 
with Jason Bieber's excellent light 
design, makjng one feel like a silent 
extra in the play. All in all , "Richard 
ill" is a sharp, modem version of 
Shakespeare's original play.

Curse: Chargers have best chance vs. Indy

he faces the Colts? If Charlie 
Batch or Tommy Maddox Stllrts 
versus the Colts, the Steelers 
have no chance; if Roethlisberger 
is healthy enough to play, the 
Steelers will have a hope and a 
prayer, but probably not a win at 
the end of the night. 

with Drew Brees and Antonio 
Gates on a roll, the Chargers 
have the same multidimensional 
offensive that the Colts thrive on. 
However, defensively the Bolts 
are lacking the same toughness as 
Indy's defense and this will even-
tually cost them the game. Plus, 
even if they do take the lead, the 
Chargers have proven they can't 
k.eep one, as they've lost a couple 
of fourth-quarter advantllges so 
far this season. 

for the Cardinals, their flaws are 
so numerous that] shouldn't even 
have to describe the many ways 
the Colts can exploit Arizona's 
holes to win.

NBA lottery pick Adam Morrison, 
limiting the G.iucho leader to l-of-6 
shooting from the field. 

In the final tuneup before the 
regular season, the Tritons stllyed up 
North tOtllke on Eastern Washlngton 
on Nov. 13 in Cheyney. 

Unable to contllin Eastern 
Washington guard Rodney Stuckey, 
who recorded a game-high 21 points 
on 50 percent (7-of- 14) shoot-
ing from the field, or match the 
Eagle offensive output, the Tritons 
dropped the final exlUbition game 
75-44, Sophomore guard Clint Allard 
became the third player to lead the 
Tritons in scoring in as many games, 
notching eight points, two rebounds 
and two steals. Freshman guard 
Shane Poppen grabbed a team-high 
five rebounds off the bench for the 
Tritons, while Eastern Washmgton 
forward Jake Beitinger pulled down 
six rebounds for the Eagles, The 
Tritons would not quit when facing 
a huge deficit, staying within three 
points, 29-26, of the Eagles in the 
second half alone. 

UCSD will now look to use the 
gained experience from its three 
exhibition games during the Nov, 18 
contest with Cal Poly.

well at times, and this proves we can 
play with anybody, We just need to 
learn now to maintllin." 

Specifically, the Tritons will 
need to maintain their improved 
defensive presence, an area stressed 
by Carr during the preseason. 

The Tritons will also work to 
continue the integration of nine 
newcomers to this year's team in 
hopes of adequately replacing a 
group of nonretuming players that 
includes three of last year's stan-
en. Hatch and Allard, who matured 
as Stllrters during their freshman 
campaigns, will be looked to for 
guidance, as will Odioh Odjyeh, one 
of the other seven rerumees and the 
team's only seruor. 

Still perfect after week II, 
the Colts will rout the 2-7 
Tennessee Tit2ns before travel-
ing to Jacksonville for an easy 
win in an AFC South Division 
rivalry game. Then comes the 
last real test: the San Diego 
Chargers. Althougb this may be 
due to a bit of San Diego bias, 
I think the Chargers have an 
offense capable of going point-
for-point with the Colt offense. 
LaDainian Tomlinson is the most 
exciting player in the NFL, and 

After beating the Chargers, the 
Colts will be two wins from per-
fection. The two wins will come 
over the Seattle Seahawks in week 
15 and the Arizona Cardinals on 
New Year's Day. Although the 
Sea hawks possess a decent record, 
they have only beaten two teams 
with winning records and pose no 
threat to the high-flying Colts. As 

That is my assessment of the 
Colts' chances at a perfect season. 
J believe they can and will make 
history, but hopefully this article 
will prevent it from happening 
thanks to the Guardian jinx. If all 
goes according to plan, the Colts 
will cruise to a 15-0 start before 
Kurt Warner throws for 370 yards 
and four TDs and shocks the 
world by leading the Cardinals to 
a freak victory over Manning and 
the Colts. However, an Arizona 
victory is more unlikely than 
John Rocker joining the AACP, 
so it's up to a student-newspaper 
curse to bring down the best tea m 
the NFL has seen in 33 years. Also returning for his sopho-

more season is Carr, who guided 
the men's basketball program to 11 
wins last year, the team's best record 
since entering Division II. Carr 
will hope to use Patterson, Poppen 
and Maulhardt along with return-
ees Peters and junior guard Mark 
Lewkowitz to improve on that mark 
and hopefully win the Caljfomia 
Collegiate Athletic Association title 
this season. 

Playoffs: Tritons look to take LMU's title 

The Cal Poly game is scheduled 
for a 7 p.m, stan time in San Lujs 
Obispo, CaJjf. Following the game 
at Cal Poly, UCSD will have eight

The UCSD men's basketball 
team will begin its regular season on 

ov. 18 with a contest against Cal 
Poly in an Luis Obispo after three 
exhibition losses against Division I 
foe UC Santa Barbara, Gonzaga 
and Eastern Washington. With 
three Division 1 schools on thei r 
exhibition chedule, the Tritons are 
preparing for a long and arduous 
season that \vill see them on the 
road for the first nine games before 
returning home in early 2006.

Water 'polo heads north for playoffs 
Tritons handed No.1 seed in WWPA Championships 

c.n't touch this: Senior Steven Jendrusina and the Tritons finished the regular season 
with a 22-7 record and will head to the WWPA Championships as the No.1 seed. 

By ANGIE LIN 
Associate Sports Editor 

After posting a 22-7 over-
all season record in two con-
ti nuous months of league 
play, the No.7 UCSD men 's 
water po lo wi ll head into the 
2005 Western Water Polo 
Association Championships 
starting on Nov. 17 as the No. 
I seed. 

With the cha nce to 
head to the NCAA tourna-
ment by taking the WWPA 
Championships, the Tritons 
received a bye in the first round 
and will first face the winner of 
the UC Santa CruzlWhittier 
Unive rsity matchup . The 
men's first match of the tour-
nament will be held at Loyola 
Marymount's Burns Recrea tion 
and Aquatics Center on Nov. 
17. 

The Tritons have faced both 
UC Santa Cruz and 'vVhittier 
in the past; they defeated 
Whittier in a hlowout 17-1 win 
in their very first match of the 
season and had no trouble out-
maneuvering the Banana lugs 
16-6 at the C anta Cruz 
Slug Fest, which they eventu -
ally went on to win by defeat-
ing Santa Clara University, Cal 
Lutheran University and Long 
Beach State in the middle of 
their season. 

The Tritons, who have 
received the No. I seed for the 
pa t fo ur seasons, are ranked 
before No. 2 seed Loyola

Colts on fast track 
to perfedion at 9-0 
Guardian curse is the only way to 
stop Indy from making history 

The Sports 
Retort 

Rael Enteen 

W ith an easy 3 1- 17 win ove r the 1 Iouston Texans last Sunday, the 
Indi anapolis Colts improved to 9-
0, moving them past the halfway 
point of their journey to an unde-
feated cason and a permanent 
place in the record books. Looking 
at the Colts' upcoming schedule 
and admiring the team' stacked 
offense and mean defense, I don 't 
envision anyone stopping the Colts 
on their way to a 16-0 record. 
Personallv, I don't want the Colts 
to break the Miami Dolphins ' 33-
yea r record, so I'm playing the 
Grinch who stole history from 
Peyton Manning and Tony Dungy 
by jinxing their season. I feel like 
jinxes, hexes, curses and evi l deeds 
of this kind are popular these days: 
The last two World Series winners 
broke curses and won over the 
nation, Sports Illustrated has its 
very own cover jinx and the wild ly 
popular Madden video game fran-
chise makes its cover boys cringe 
with its curse. Now it is time for 
the Guardian to perform a hex of 
its own on the Indianapolis Colts 
by explai ning exactly how the 
Colts wi ll overcome their remain-
ing challenges and predictin g a 
perfect season after nine games. 

T he Colts have seven games 
left on thei r schedule, bu t only 
five of their opponents have win-
ning records and only three of the 
teams - the Cincinnati Be ngals, 
the Pittsburgh Steelers and the 
San Diego C hargers - pose a 
semilegiti mate threat to the Colts' 
d ream team. 

The Bengals, holding a 7-2 
record thanks to a surpri singly 
strong defense and the tan dem 

of newly matured quarterback 
Ca rson Palmer and playmaki ng 
wide receiver C had Johnson, wi ll 
get the chance to break the streak 
this Sunday when they host the 
Colts. Many see the Bengals as the 
team that can prevent the Colts 
from making history. However, 
Dungy has too many weapons on 
offense and defense to give any 
team a chance. The Benga l defense 
has held three teams to under 10 
poi n ts this yea r, but they have not 
face d a team with Manning, Marvin 
I Tarrison and Edgerrin J ames. 
M anning is too sma rt, too talented 
and has too many top receivers 
(H arri on, Reggie Wayne and 
Brandon Stokley) not to exploit the 
Benga l defense for at least three 
pa~ ing TD~. Throw in another 
100-yard game for Jal11 e~ and the 
Colts offense ~hould post at least 
30 points on the scorehoard. On 
the other side of the ball, Dwight 
Freeney will destroy the Bengals' 
offensive line and force Palmer 
into rushed throws to Johnson . 
Although the Bengals' offense has 
had success against some of the 
mediocre tca ms around the FL, 
the Colt defense has improved 
since 2004 and (even including a 
bomb toJohnson and a solid game 
from the Bengals' other Johnson 
- Rudi) Indy's defense should be 
able to keep Cincy's offense under 
wraps for four quarters. 

From Cincinnati, Dungy wi ll 
lead his team home to take on the 
Steel Curtain on Monday Night 
Football in the Colts' biggest test 
all year. Pittsburgh's notoriously 
stingy defense has the best chance 
at slowing, not stopping, Manni ng 
and the Colts. However, they 
sti ll don't have a good enough 
squad to hand Indy their fi rst loss. 
T he Steelers' sta rting Q B, Big 
Ben Roethlisberger, is question-
able for Pi ttsburgh 's game against 
the Ravens this Sunday, so who 
knows how healthy he'll be when
