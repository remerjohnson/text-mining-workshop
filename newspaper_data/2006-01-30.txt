STATE OF THE UNION: BEATING AROUND THE BUSH ~ OPINION, PAGE 4 

Shuttle 
Vehicles Get 
Soccer Mom 
Treatment 

Due to complaints of 
noise and a dearth, of 
riders, U CSD subs 
vans for buses during 
late hours. 

By Jadyn Snow 
STArF WRITER 

With record gas prices and wor-
ries about rising pollution and global 
warming, someone at Transportation 
and Parking Services realized that 
bigger may not always be better. 

Since fall, larger shuttle buses 
have been phased out in favor of 
smalJer vans on city routes after 9 
p.m., although the actual number of 
vehicles running has not changed. 

The vans seat fewer than half 
of the passengers as the buses and 
do n~t al low standing to accom-
modate any extra riders . However, 
the change was made for efficiency, 
which is exactly what the new vehi -
cles offer, according to shuttle driver 
Alan Bui. 

" It's nicer for me, easier to drive, 
[but) I can see how it's cumbersome 
for riders since we can only carry 
about 25 people and there is no 
standing, but the route is faster so w~ 
can handle more;' said Bui, an Earl 
Warren College junior. 

The change from big to smalJ has 
also cut down on pollution, elimi-
nating the large buses' dependency 
on diesel fuel , according to Frank 
Buono, the shuttle operations coor-
dinator for TPS. 

The new system has worked so 
smoothly that most student shuttle 
riders have found no reason to com-
plain about the new size, according 
to Buono. The faster new vans take 
15 minutes per trip compared to 25 
minutes the buses take. . 

"I've noticed I'm normally the 
only person on the bus at night when 
I ride around 10:30 p.m.," Eleanor 
Roosevelt College sophomore 'Katie 
park said. "I think it was a good 
switch for the school for gas effi -
ciency." 

The switch came after TPS exam-
ined student usage of the shuttles, 
community concerns about noise 
and the vehicles' impact on the envi-
ronment. 

"With input from the community, 
as well as our students, we were able 
to provide more direct service to 
our more highly populated student 
residential areas," Parking Services 
Director Greg Snee stated in an e-
mail. "Changes were also made to 
focus on express services, wh ich

FORCE 
READY FOR 
'HARDBALL' 

By Matthew McArdle 
ASSOCIATE NEWS EDITOR 

Administrators will put a revised 
draft of the Student-Run Television 
charter under scrutiny this week in 
their first negotiations with mem -
ber of the new SRTV task force, 
who will try to find a compromise on 
differing philosophies to bring the 
station back on -air. 

The administration and SRTV 
have presented conflicting ideas for 
the future of the station, including 
opposite opinions about revision to 
the station's cha rter that could pro-
hibit "graphical depictions of sexual 
activity involving nudity." 

Students Throw Out SRTV Porn Ban 
While RTV managers and sup-

porters have long opposed the ban, 
acting Assistant Vice Chancellor of 
Student Life Gary R. Ratcliff ha 
said he requires the provision to be 
included in the charter for the sta-
tion to be reactivated. 

Effects of the special 
election on the future 
of the station is still 
unknown. Vote was 
split on both ballots. 

By Charles Nguyen 
NEWS EDITOR 

Students voted to throw 
out A.S. regulations governing 
Student-Run Television last week, 
heralding a victory for free-speech 
advocates in their fight to reacti -
vate the station. 

Approximately 16 percent of 
the student body participated .in 
the vote, barely makjng the 15 
percent minimum necessary to 
validate the special election. 

In the first vote on the bal -
lot, students overturned an A.S. 
Council amendment to the SRTV 
charter that banned "graphi -
cal depictions of sexual activity 
involving nudity." The amendment 
was first approved in a council 
vote on Oct. 26 in response to 
earlier station airings of porno-
graphic material by John Muir 
College alumnus Steve York. 

The council later voted unani-
mously to bar York from the sta-
tion. That decision was also over-
turned by the special election. 

" I think it's funny that students , 
have overturned a council deci -
sion that was unanimous," York 
said. "They ignored their constit-
uents and now the mandate has 
come down from the students." 

Sixth College Senior Senator 
Matt Corrales, who penned the 
ballot argument to uphold the 
ban on nudity and York, did not 
respond to requests for comment. 

Each of the prOvisions on the bal-
lot was approved by a slim margin, 
with 52 percent of students voting 
to strike the nudity ban out of the 
station's charter. Fifty percent of the 
voters approved to annul the sanc-
tion of York and "Koala Tv" The 
divided vote' immediate impact on 
the A.S. Council and student body 
is minimal, according to Station co-
Manager Andrew Tess. 

"There may have been a split, 
but it was a split of 15 percent of 
the student body:' he said. ") kind 
of view it as the majority of people 
just really don't care. But) doubt 
it has had any drastic effect on 
the council's ability to represent

Part of the special election team posts up 
the results of last week's student vote. 
the students. It won't hurt them' 
on the majority of issues that they 
bring to students." 

However, the special election 
will leave a definitive mark on 
this year's general election, where 
counciLmembers wishing to win 
would be smart to take results 
into consideration, Tess said . 

"This could make or break a 
campaign depending on how you 
approached this special election:' 
he said. "It'll be interesting to see 
what the dynamics and politics 
are [for) candidates for the next 
A.S. Council." 

The special election may have 
no bearing for administrators, 
who are keeping the station off 
the air until another charter is 
drafted. While student opinion is 
considered, allowing pornography 
on the university-owned Triton 
Cable network, which broadcasts 
SRTV, is not a viable option, 
according to acting Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of Student Life Gary 

[ ELECTION, page 3 ) 

John Muir College Junior Senator 
and task force member Adam Grant 
stated in an e; mail that the task 
force is "in a very interesting spot 
with regards to the administration" 
because of the special election, in 
which students threw out a council 
decision to ban sexual nudity on the 
station. Still, there is no guarantee 
that administrators wiJJ go along with 
the student vote, Grant indicated. 

"As a member of the SRTV task 
force, ) think it is too early to tell 
where this will go:' Grant stated. "We 
are set to meet with members of the 
administration . .. to discuss exactly 
where we stand in the process. Until 
we present the revised charter to 
them, and explain to them how [our] 
hands are tied concerning the ban on 
pornography, it· would be premature 
of me to guess the outcome." 

Because students overturned the 
decisions of the A.S. Council banning 
exual nudity, John Muir College 

alumnus Steve York and "Koala TV" 
from the station, the council cannot, 
according to its own bylaws, reintro-
auce any legislation on the issue for 
at least one year. 

The condition, which Ratcliff has 
called "untenable:' could make the 
university liable to a slew of ques-
tionable programming. '. 

The university owns Triton 
Cable, through which the station's 
signal runs, and until the ban is 
incorporated into the charter, SRTV 
will remain off the air, according to 
Ratcliff. 

Some task force members don't 
see university control the same way. 
Students shou ld resolve the cur-
rent SRTV contlict, and administra-
tors are only making the issue more

U.S. Lagging in 
Science, Math 

The Association of American 
Universities has released a new 
report th at detail s the signifi -
cant decline in the number of 

Ameri~an scientists, engineers 
and language experts since the 
end of the 1960s. 

The report high I ighted key 
ways to bolster government sup-
port for those programs in i nstitu -
tions of higher education. 

It also suggested three rea-
sons that the study of science, 
engineering and la nguage is 
decl ining: serious problems in 
the American educational system, 
decreasing incentives for students 
to study c ritical scientific, engi-
neering and language fi elds and 
insufficient funding for research . 

The report recommended that 
un iversi ties nationwide expand 
their programs in these respective 
areas and also declared that the 
U.S. government should spend 
more money on research, support 
more elementary and secondary 
science education programs and 
establish a new graduate fellow-
ship program that supports stu-
dents seeking doctoral degrees in 
math - or science-related fields . 

UCSD Cultivates 
Future Scientists 

The UC Office of the President 
has a nnounced that UCSD will 
establish a n outreach program, 
dubbed the California State 
Summer chool for Mathematics 
and Science, this summer based at 

the Jacobs School of Engineering. 
The goal of the 'program, 

which was established for bright 
students in grades 8-12 , is to 
"motivate prospective scientists, 
engineers and mathematicians in 
California and the nation and to 
create a statewide community of 
scholars ." 

The program also has branches 
at UC Davis, UC Irvine and UC 
Santa Cruz. While the other cam-
puses enroll about 150 students 
each, UCSD's inaugural class will 
consist of , 20 students. 

National Science 
Academy Lauds Prof 
The National Academy of 

Sciences has elected UCSD 
research professor Russell F. 
Doolittle to receive the John J. 
Carty Award for the Advancement 
of Science. . 

Doolittle, who holds appoint-
ments in both the chemistry 
and biology departments, will 
receive a medal and a check for 
$125,000 at the academy's 143rd 
annual awards ceremony dinner 
in Washington, D.C., in April. 

The awa rd, a well-respected 
prize in the scientific community, 
has been given annually since 
'932 and recognizes individu-
als "for noteworthy and distin-
guished accomplishment in any 
field of science." 

Acco,ding to the academy, 
Doolittle was selected "for con-
tributing seminal insights and 
methods for using computers as 
an aid to characterizing protein 
function , in comparing amino 
acid sequences and for phyloge-
netic reconstructions ."

Task · Force Members 
Optimistic About SRTV 
~ SRTV, from page 1 
difficult, according to Revelle 
College Senior Senator and task 
force member Rachel Corell. 

"The administration says it's a 
student issue, but it took ISRTVI 
away from us," CoreU said. " It 
could care less about this elec-
tion; it has its own agenda." 

The special election results 
should force the university to 
reconsider its demands, since it 
has long held onto the argu-
ment that students do not want 
pornography on their station, 
acco'rding to A.S. Vice President 
of Academic Affairs and task . 
force member Harry Khanna. 

"I have a good feeling;' 
Khanna said. "The special elec-
tion results kick .the legs out 
of one of the university's main 
arguments. We will sit down and 
reach a compromise that's in the , 
best interests of both the stu-
dents and the university." 

The student vote gives the 
task force a large bargaining chip 

it should use with administra-
tors, according to York. 

"I think they need to start 
pJaying hardball," York said. 

Both Corell and Khanna 
said that the task force has sev-
eral "ideas" regarding a' com: 
promise between the university 
and SRTV, but neither would 
elaborate. 

However, many student par-
ties are optimistic about negotia -
tions, and say that an agreement 
will be reached soon. 

"One way or another, we'll 
see a solution by the end of 
the quarter," Station CO-Manager 
Andrew Tess said. 

Corell, who also said that she 
was happy that students voted to 
overturn the legislation, voiced a 
similar confidence. 

"Things are going to hap-
pen ," she said. "We're going to 
get SRTV back."

However, with the A.S.

suade Ratcliff to renege on his 
position, which he has held since 
the .annoLl;ncement of the special 
election. 

"The 'graphic' depiction 
clause is off the table from the 

A.S. perspective, because stu -
dents have told them so;' Tess 
said. "If administrators really 
want to tell the cnuncil and stu-
dents that they don't trust them 
anymore, there are parties who 
are ready to go to court at this 
point. We'll see how IRatcliff's]

allowed us to better use the capaci ty 
of the existing buses at high usage 
periods. In addition, by converting 

/ to the smaller, more efficient vehicles 
in the evening hours, we were able to 
reduce the impact of our services on 
the community and still provide an 
efficient and viable service for our 
students, staff and faculty." 

Requests to tone down the noise 
from shuttle buse ' have come from 
La jolla residents since 2002, Buono 
said. TPS has al 0 changed the route 
to eliminate the heavily ,tudent-pop-
ulated Gilman Drive stops to cut 
down on noise. 

· We want to serve our customer 
base and Keep our neighbors in the 
area happy; Buono stated. "We feel 
that we can do both .... We made an 
agreement with a resident committee 
to burn cleaner and operate smaller 
buses after 9 p.m. This did cut down 
on the noise pollution in the area." 

The availability of student park-
ing has had a direct correlation with 
the use of campus shuttles. Student-
reserved parking spots, marked as 
usn spots, have dropped from 7,043 
in january 2002 to 6,460 this month, 
forcing many students to seek alter-
native forms of transportation. 

As "s" spots continue to dwindle, 
more students have to rely on the 
buses to take them to and from cam-
pus, and the campus shuttle system 
has taken much of the transportation 
burden, ballooning from more than 
18,000 riders per day in 2002 to over 
24,000 currently. 

In addition, the City Shuttle route 
has gone from almost 3,000 riders to 
almost 8,000 riders per day.

Critics of "radical 
professors" miss the 
point of a college 
education. 

By Megan Durham 
STAFF WRtTER 

A n old adage goes, if you're not liberal by 20, you have no heart, but if you're not con-
servative by 40, you have no brain. It 
i widely accepted that the university 
commUllity is primarily a liberal one, 
but few people have declared war on 
that bias so completely as And rew 
jones. 

The Bruin Alumni Association, 
the brainchild of this former UCLA 
alumnus, seeks to provide proof of 
"an increasi ngly radical faculty" at 
UCLA. To reach this goal, until very 
recently, the si te offered students up 
to $100 to provide proof. in the form 
of lecture recordings and class mate-
rials, that their teachers were devot-
ing a significant portion of their class 
time to "abusive, one-sided or off-
topic classroom behavior:' The site 
also made a ranking of the 28 most 
radical professor profues, calling it 
the "dirty 30:' 

The entire affair is essentially a 
thinly veiled publicity stunt, no dif-
fe rent than the "affirmative-action 
bake sales" that Jones organized while 
still an undergraduate and member 
of the College Republicans. Cookies 
ranged in price depending on the 
customer's race, and the news cover-
age was invariably more significant 
than having the people actually buy 
a nack. 

jones' major goal seems to be 
to work at "depoliticizing the class-
room and emphasizing professional 
behavior:' an idea that most would 
agree sounds like a good one, but 
his evidence against the liberal class-
room demeanor of UCLA professors 
is slim. at best. 

The site touts its professor pro-
ftIes as demonstrating that "these 
professors are actively proselytizing 
their extreme views in the classroom. 
whether or not the commentary is 
relevant to the class topic.". But the 

profiles themselves don't deliver, 
as most of those proflled don't rely 
on in-class off-topic speeches, but 
instead on petitions, projects, ral -
lies and activist organizations that 
these professors have been a part of 
either in the past and outside of the 
classroom. 

For ex.ample, the front page of the 
site implies that Douglas Kellner, a 
UCLA professor of education, "rages 
about a Bush Reich" in the classroom. 
But his profUe instead states that this 
professor is "not much of a fire-start-
er" inside class but rather is judged as 
a radical from his various papers and 
publications. 

While it is possible that profes-
sors who' are politically active may 
be more likely to share their views 
in the classroom, the very fact that 
they are ilIvolved is not evidence that 
they are "actively proselytizing their 
extreme views in the classroom" or 
that they are not displaying "profes-
sional behavior." What happens when 
they are off the clock doesn't make 
them any less knowledgeable about 
their subject matter, or any less able 
to teacp it. 

It is also important that non -
academic organizations or students 
may not be proper judges of profes-
or conduct. "Only other special-

ists can determine whether a 
professor is just spewing off 
nonsense out of personal 
bias or is really conveying 
conclu ions from painstak-
ing research~ said Branislav 
Slantchev, an assistant pro-
fessor in U CSD's political 
science department. 

This is particularly 
true in political science 
classes, where the profes-
sors discuss public policy 

. and political theories as 
a matter of course. These 
teachers are expected to dis-
cuss theories that may offend 
some students, but it is part 
of a student's responsibil-
ity to take them 
in stride. Sandy 
Lakciff, another 
political science professor, 
mentions that taking a political sci-
ence class "carries with it an obliga-

MONDAY. JANUARY 30, 2006 

tion to recognize that our theories 
may be biased and the evidence selec-
tive:' . 

Of course, political vi~ws in . a 
poli-sci class seem more appropriate 
than such views shared in a math or 
biology class. But there are ways of 
responding that are better than jones' 
Web site. Slantchev believes that "stu-
dents are smart enough to vote with 
their feet." 

~Drop classes that are ridiculously 
biased," he explained. "Or don't enroll 
in th~m in the first place." 

Besides, if students are honestly 
worried about hearing political pro-
paganda in the classroom rather than 
lecture material, they can research 
the professor before enrolling in th~ 
class. There are several Web sites 

-that provide excellent information on 
professors, such as Ratemyprofessors. 
com. It not only includes student rat-
ings on how difficult or clear a given 
professor is, it also includes student 
comments that are likely to tell you if 
the professor spends-most of his time 
discussing off-topic subject matte.r. If 
a student ends up in a class where she 
disagrees adamantly with the profes-
sor's views, it's a lot more reasonable 
and a lot less shrill to just drop the 

class rather than canlpaign for it to 
never be given again. After 

all, you're paying for 
the privilege of being 
able to take a class, 
and when you <lon't 
like what 

you're paying for, you cancel your 
service. 

The perverse thing about Jones' 
pUblicity stunt is that the criticisms 
targeting it might be as baseless as the 
Bruin Alumni Association accusa-
tions. The Los Angeles Times reports. 
"Some of the instructors mentioned 
[in the professor proftlesl accuse the 
association of conducting a witch hunt 
that threatens to harm the teaching 
atmosphere:' But most of the profes-
sors interviewed didn't believe such 
a program would actually damage 
student -professor relations as much 
as the article implies. Lakoff said that 
students can do whatever they want 
with materials presented in class ~s 
long as they don't "disrupt the class or 
take things out of conten." Slantchev 
also agrees that if such a program 
were implemented at UCSD, it would 
not damage his relationships with his 
students. 

"I give students more credit than 

that," he said.~ut perhaps the most 
baffling thing about' the entire issue 
is that everyone siinply assumes that 
college students are lambs being led 
to the slaughter. Students are fully 
capable of thinl<;ing for themselves 
and forming opinions independent 
of the herd; just looking at the recent 
Student-Run Television events pro-
vides proof of that. 

Even if one assumes what Jones 
portrays is true, just because one side 
may be represented more in a class-
room doesn't mean that students will 
unwittingly assume that all their pro-
fessor says is true and sacrosanct. If it 
is the case that a professor is abusing 
his power of a captive audience with 
political beliefs, then word will get 
around, less people will take the class 
and hopefully students will complain 
to the university, the best qualified 
judge in the matter. 

A vigilante organization' such as 
the Bruin Alumni Association is not 
oruy unnecessary - frankly, it is in 

bad taste.

The Real State of the Union: Hang On Folks, We're In for a Rough Ride 
M y fellow Americans, before the State of the Union address on jan. 31 , which 
the president will likely fill with proc-
lamations of patriotism, freedom an9 
democracy, let's take a moment to 
be honest about the real state of the 
union: damaged. 

Since President George W. Bush's 
last State of the Union address, America 
has traveled in search of a promised 

when police attempted to clear traf-
fic by shooting rounds into the air, 
like the U.S. military interpreter found 
dead by gunshot in a car in Baghdad, 
like the two Iraqi civilians who lost 
their lives to a roadside bomb or like 
the kidnapped American journalist 
Jill Carrol, whose life still remains at 
stake. 

democracy that 
we have come no 
closer to fmding. 
Democracy will . 
not be found over-
eas in countries 

Mr: President, the union is in 
shambles and hopes for resolve con-

tinually grow dim-
mer as the plans for 

The American a reconstruction of 
U · Iraq's infrastruc-top I a ture and govern-

suffering from 
tyranny, corrup-
tion_ and poverty. ' 
Democracy, like peace, starts at home. 

Over the last 12 months, death 
tolls resulting from the war in Iraq 
have soared, with an estimated 2,238 
Americans now dead and approximate 
Iraqi civilian deaths ranging from 
10,000 to more than 37,000. 

We can no longer ignore the perils 
of this war or the lives it has taken. 
We need to be bothered by head-
lines noting the deaths of innocent 
Iraqi civilians, like women shot dead 

ment continue to 
ha Naraghi fall short. 

,,,,,,,\.,u.,,,uu ,Many of the 
planned reform 

projects are failing as a result of an 
increased need for security because of 
the continuing insurgency. In a project 
aimed at bringing drinking water to 
more iraqis, poly approximately 34 
percent of the original 8 million civil-
ians it was to affect will now receive 
clean water. The Washington Post 
reports also show that 125 of the 425 
electricity projects underway will not 
be completed, due to a $3 billion shift 
in funds. 

Yet we contihue to pour money into 
a war effort that damages our nation 
and its ill state of democracy. Let's 
face it: We are no closer to democracy 
and Liberty than we ane to discovering 
Tuck's fountain of immortality. 

Iraq. unfortunately, is only one 
pressing concern for this disheartened 
union . Attempts to fight terrorism 
outside of Iraq have also presented 
great costs to America in the past year. 
The costs associated with war (civilian 
and soldier casualties and the nation's 
growing debt) outweigh the marginal 
benefits of increasing our nation's pro-
tection with little evidence that we 
actually prevented terrorism. 

Ties between the administration 
and its citizens have also been crip-
pled by Bush's unwarranted domes-
tic spying. which continues to leave 
Americans unsatisfied with their gov-
ernment. According to a recent poll 
by the Post, 56 percent of Ammans 
disapprove of the way Bush handles 
ethics in the government. 

Extensive government tax cuts 
th(Oughout the years and increued 
spending on homeland security will 
cost Americans dearly in 2006 as deep 
spending cuts mark the president's 
agenda. While the 2006 budget will 

cut funding for the Department of 
Homeland Security by $1 billion this 
year, its overall budget ($29.6 billion) 
still remains $3 billion higher than· it 
was in 2004, the Post reported. 

Sadly, education will be one of 
the big losers this year, as its already 
small budget will face a $1.5 billion 
cuI. Preceding the passage of 2002's 
No Child Left Behind Act, aimed at 
strengthening education by requiring 
students to achieve 100 percent pro-
ficiency in reading and math by 2014, 
the president said, "If our country 
fails its responsibility to educate every 
child, we're likely to fail in many.other 
areas. !Jut if we succeed in educating 
our youth, many other successes will 
follow throughout our country and in 
the lives of our citizens.· 

• Instead of following his own advice 
about natio~ education, the presi-
dent has spent the year promoting 
a Social Security reform bill that, if 
eva- pllled, would be so watered-
down, its reforms would be use-
less. Focusing attention and funding 
back on a reform program that truly 
showed immense promise, such · as 
the NCLDA, would be a huge step in 
the right direction for the future of 
America, particularly its youth, whose 

education is often overlooked and its 
hnportance underestimated. 

Sadly, this week's State of the Union 
address will be much less about presi-
dential mistakes and how to correct 
them than it will be about avoidance. 

Come Tuesday, the president will 
likely speak t.o our fears in an attempt 
to justify massive spending on all the 
wrong programs. He'll stand in front 
of an American flag and he'll preach 
to us about patriotism and democracy 
and cutting frivolous- spending and 
greedy lawyers and illegal immigra-
tion, He'U avoid all the key issues, but 
relentlessly shout his untiring suppon 
for the war in Iraq and the waroOn ter-
ror. He'U be the king of the stcawman 
argument. But the last thing America 
needs is a scarecrow as a president, 
frightening off other nations and 
alienating it' with conquests. 

This is our moment of opportuni-
ty. We must be brave - brave enough 
to aclcnowledge courage as more than 
combating the terrors of other nations. 
We must be brave in combating the 
terrors right here at home, starting 
with the administration. 

'J'he president can wave his flag as 
high u he likes, but that won't change 
the crippled state of the union.

GUEST COMMENTARY 
Blacklisted Professors at UCLA: Are We.Trying to Go Back to the Future? 

By ScoLl Boehm 

A ndrew Jones says he wants a more "fair and balanced" univerSity. What he really 
needs is a time machine. His newly 
formed Bruin Alumni Association 
longs for a past that never was 
while seeking to create a future for 
academia based on 19505 nostal-
gia. The group's headline-grabbing 
attempt at blacklisting professors 
that challenge Jones' pre-civil-rights 
sensibilities is the latest stab at roll-
ing back time at universities across 
the country. From David Horowitz's 
Orwellian-dubbed "Students for 
Academic Freedom" to Internet sites 
such as Campus Watch to state leg-
islation that would regulate course 
syllabi, Jones is the player of the 
week in this revamped version of 
Pick Up Sticks, in which so-called 
"liberal ," "unpatriotic" and "biased" 
professors are carefully singled out 
and placed into a jar contemptu-
ously labeled "political radicals." 

Like Marty McFly in "Back to the 
Future ," the 1985 blockbuster that 
responded to the pressures of Cold 
War ReaganomicS and suburban

malaise by catapulting its protago-
nist back to 1955 in a souped-up 
DeLorean, Jonc;s and his crew are 
searching for a vehicle to transport 
the university back to an idealized 
era: 

Departments such as ethnic 
studies and women's studies, found-
ed in order to critically engage and 
challenge the knowledge produced 
by white, male-dominated insti-
tutions, are now ironically under 
attack for not being mainstream 
enough. Likewise, Middle Eastern 
studies programs from Columbia 
to UC Berkeley have been viciously 
assailed for being "anti -American" 
or for being funded by so-called 
"blood money· - presumably from 
the pockets of fanatical terrorists. 
Professors of Chicano studies are 
"too political." Anti -war statements 
that even the majority of Americans 
would now agree with are grounds 
for being considered "biased," while 
drawing parallels between Iraq and 
Vietnam is "heresy." And taped to 
that timeless touchstone of free 
speech - the university professor's 
door - political cartoons mocking 
the president are potential evidence 

of "disloyalty:' 
Doesn't this sound all too famil-

iar? Didn't George Clooney just 
make a film about this? 

During the 1940s and '50s, the 
House Un-American Activities 
Committee investigated, blacklist-
ed and imprisoned labor leaders 
and union members, writers and 
intellectuals, as well as actors and 
directors for being "Reds." Cultural 
icons such as Charlie Chaplin, 
Arthur Miller, Dorothy Parker, 
Richard Wright, james Baldwin 
and Orson Welles were persecuted 
in the biggest national witch hunt 
since Puritan times. In addition to 
holding inquisition-like hearings, 
Senator Joseph McCarthy estab-
lished the Overseas Library Program 
that removed 30,000 books con-
sidered "un -American" from U.S. 
library shelves. 

Jones is no McCarthy, but he is a 
symptom of the new McCarthyism 
that employs popularized free-mar-
ket reasoning and consumer choice 
rhetoric in attempts to discredit 
independent - minded professors 
and, ultimately, dismantle programs 
in the humanities and social sci-

ences that fail to treat their cus-
tomers as always right. By using 
alumni funds as leverage to influ-
ence curricula and the intellectual 
climate of UCLA , jones' approach 
- also found at Penn State and 
Hamilton College in upstate New 
York - mixes Burger King slogans 
with neoliberal logic to produce 
the appearance of irresponsible and 
subversive scholarship. 

But academia is not a fast food 
joint where you can have everything 
your way; rather, it is one of the few 
remaining sites of critical inquiry 
and debate in a hypercommercial -
ized society. As Thomas Wortham, 
UCLA's English department chair 
- and registered Republican -
commented in response to declin-
ing Jones' invitation to join the 
Bruin Alumni Association advi-
sory board, "If you don't question 
things in a univerSity, where are 
you supposed to question them? At 
a ~niver!ity you have independent 
thmkers. 

Big Man on Campus wannabes 
like Jones regress into what Russell 
Jacoby - one of the blackli sted 
"dirty 30" - has called conservative 

crybabies. If they weren't spoiled by 
the persistent inequalities of race, 
class, gender and sexuality that 
they can easily exploit to their own 
advantage, university administra-
tors, state legislators and the mai n-
stream media wouldn't even listen 
to their cacophonic swan song. But 
despite their claims to the contrary, 
middle-class, straight, white males 
still si t at the top of the social hier-
archy - within and outside of the 
university. 

jones, Horowitz and their mis-
guided followers want to live in an 
'era that never existed, a whitewashed 
society devoid of any ' real social 
conflict. If there was ever a case 
that proved the absolute necessity of 
the departments and scholars under 
attack by the new McCarthyism, it 
is jones' own myopic vision of the 
past. He is proof enough that we 
need more academics like the "dirty 
30," not fewer.

When biology Professor Raffi Aroian retu rned from a late-morning . workout to his office atop Bonner Hall, he was hungry. Before applying 
a' thick coal of pea nut butter to a mul -
tigrain tortilla for his ow n lunch. he 
generously offered the entire contents 
of his small pantry. Savoring the initial 
bi tes of thi makeshi ft burrito. he then 
laun hed into a monologue about the 
innovative lab to which he owes his 
name and the research that fuels hi 
passion fo r "di covering things that 
no one has ever seen:' 

In 1998, an academic partner-
ship between the professor and for-
mer Revell e College undergraduate 
Di no Elyassnia provided the catalyst 
for a project that has since proven 
groundbreaking on the research 
of bac terial pathogenesis amongst 
nematodes, commonly known as 
worms. The lab today has grown to 
13 members. including the professor 
and staff from the undergraduate to 
postdoctoral levels. 

Its scientists study several proj-
ects rr lated to a naturally occurring 
bacteria named Bacilus thuringiensis 
(Bt). which produces a crystal protein 
used avidly amongst agriculturalists 
as both an environmentally conscious 
alternative to chemically derived 
insecticides and a fatal toxin in plant-
eating pests. 

"[ Crystal proteins I look almost like 
diamonds; they're very. very small. 
but they're beautiful ," Aroian said of 
these bacterial gems. 

The proteins encoded in these 
crystals. when configured in the 
genetic makeup of crops. effectively 
eliminate the scourge of caterpillars 
and other insects while delivering a 
product safe for humans and animals 
alike to consume. Anticipating that 
Bt would display equal toxicity in 
nematodes as it had with insects. the 
Aroian lab has unleashed a sub et of 
crystal proteins on a particular spe-
cies of harmless nematodes caJJed C. 
elegans in the hope of one day using 
lhis model for a more insidious group

of parasitic nematodes. 
However, the Aroian lab oper-

ates with great caution. They forecast 
that C. elegans. like any nematode. 
would assert biological defenses in 
much the same manner that bac teria 
develop immunity toward antibiot-
ics. "[Researchers] want to under-
stand how resistance develops before

health and agricultural productivity:' 

This sa me concern for the global 
community found its way into the 
classroom. At 8 a.m. early in the 
week. Aroian, dressed ina bright 
red sweater. spoke to a lecture hall 
Hlled with sleepy cell biologists in 
the making. 

As though addressing a quickly

cal mechanisms [and] the 
genetic mechanisms that

underlie resistance:' Aroian said. "We 
can try to develop countermeasures 
against it:' 

Undergraduate re earcher Chih 
Hsu noted that Aroian's lab has pio-
neered much of the research in com-
prehending resistance pathways spe-
cific to C. e1egans against the crystal 
protein of Bt. Aroian affirmed that 
a major pathway discovered by the 
team has provided promising insights 
to overcoming resistance. although 
Hsu estimated that the development 
for a preventative treatment against 
parasitic forms is "very far" down on 
the projected chronology. 

Parasitic nematodes. unlike C. 
elegans, do not languish innocuously 
in the soil. Rather, they comprise 10 
percent of the estimated 100.000 to 
1 million worms that affect both ani-
mals and plants. Aroian's animated 
voice grew urgent as he considered 
the one-third of the world population 
that presently suffers from some form 
of intestinal roundworm. "It's really 
an underappreciated health problem. 
and most of these people live in devel-
oping countries. so it's not on our 
radar," he said. 

Stanford biologist Joel Griffitts. 
who once worked as a UCSD grad-
uate student under Aroian's ' watch. 
asserted that his former teacher's goal 
to understand crystal toxins thrives 
under the impetus to improve human 
conditions. 

"He is always driven to make use 
of basic scientific discoveries to bet-
ter society:' Griffitts said. " [He] has 
engaged in fruitful colJaborations that 

to firmly attach itself to 
his chest. Aroian quipped with equal 
parts mischief and sincerity, "What 
can we do to spice this up for you? I 
can dance the salsa. I can indeed." 

True to hi s promise. the 
Massachusetts Lnstitute of Technology, 
California Institute of Technology and 
UC San Francisco graduate began to 
dance to an invisible band. Little do 
his students know that this esteemed 
biologist has also mastered the fox 
trot, the tango and the.rumba. 

Hsu encountered the energetic 
professor as a plate pourer last spring. 
He recollected his first impression of 
Aroian in the lab setup as easy-going 
and then added, "The lab is really 
friendly [and] everyone is really nice." 

Griffitts. who conducted major 
experiments in Aroian's Lab and co-
authored several articles with the 
professor. characterized Aroian as a 
mentor who encourages academic 
independence in the laboratory with 
a particularly taxing technique of 
withholding answers to students' 
queries "in the hope that they might 
be able to think it through and come 
up with the answers themselves." 

"It was not unusual for him to sit 
down with a student or staff member 
and say, 'I have a great idea for how 
to test this hypothesis. Let's see if you 
can come up with what I'm think-
ing about. and we'll talk tomorrow:" 
Griffitts said. 

Aroian's desire to create an envi-
ronment of inquiry extends to his 
undergraduate cell biology cIass. He 
constructs his lecture around the 
questions that students pose and rc-

He also uses a unique method of 
questioning: maneuvering his eye-
brows up and down while waiting 

- for a response. After a concentrated 
manipulation of his brow. he admit-
ted to students. "1 got my eyebrows 
trimmed so J can do that so weLL" 

His technique has not only drawn 
laughter from pupils but has thrust 
figures like Elyassnia and Griffitts 
Qnto successful career trajectories -
the former of whom Aroian believes 
now attends medical school. 

Griffitts plans to set up a research 
laboratory at Brigham Young 
University in Utah. The Aroian Lab 

veteran lauded Aroian as a critical 
springboard in his career and "part 
of a lineage of great scientists. hav-
ing been trained by some of the best 
mind s in . the biomedical sciences;' 
Griffitts concluded. 

" I have enjoyed watching him rise 
to his great potential, and hope that 
I can do my part to carryon the 
legacy:' Griffitts said. 

Aroian appears undaunted by the 
prospect of a Legacy, however. Grateful 
for what he termed "the opportuni-
ty just to live and breathe and grow 
everyday:' you will find him amongst 
the gleaming glass lab apparatus Lis-
tening to some internal rhythm and 
dancing.

'Democracy's' Dan'gerous Sequel 
Two international relations 
specialists explain why 'the 
democratic peace' may not 

. be so peaceful, after all. 

By Vladimir Kogan 
SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

the Democratic Peace Theory has ventions of democracy - elections 
largely taken on more and more may .actually lead to tht: rise of 
qualifications and limits. In recent ultranationalist parties, which can 
years, political scientists have sug- push them into war. Despite its dry,

racy" and "war:' tional system.

it accuses Jews TO FIG HT from promoting in itself and as an eventual means to 
of using "secret peace - the rise increasing global peace and stability:' 
societies, such of democracy Mansfield and Snyder state in the 

By EDWARD D. may actually book. Their conclusion, though, is a as Freemasons, 
Rotary Clubs 
and the Lions" 
for sparking 
the French 
Revolution and 
the birth of communism. This is per-
haps why the victory of the group, 
also known as the Islamic Resistance 
Movement, in last week's Palestinian 
legislative elections has cast a long 
and uncomfortable shadow over 
hopes for a peaceful solution to the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 

Combined with other demo-
cratic successes of Islamist parties 
last year, including the election of a 
Shia-dominated Iraqi parliament and 
the many electoral victories of the 
Muslim Brotherhood (from which 
Hamas emerged) in Egypt, Hamas' 
election largely repud iates President 
George W. Bush's assertion that the 
spread of democracy is the best way 
to ensure lasting world peace. 

"The reason why I'm so strong 
on democracy is [that I democracies 
don't go to war with each other," 
Bush said during a joint appearance 
with British Prime Minister Tony 
Blair in late 2004. «I've got great 
faith in democracies to promote 
peace, And that's why I'm such a 
strong believer that lhe way forward 
in the Middle East, the broader 
Middle East, is to promote democ-
racy." 

To be fair, Bush was not the 
fi rst to voice his support for the 
Democratic Peace Theory. The idea 
that democracies are less likely to 
become involved in international 
conflict was first introduced by 
philosopher Immanuel Kant in his 
1795 essay "Perpetual Peace," and 
was also behind Woodrow Wilson's 
famous, and rejected, 14-point pro-
posal at the end of World War I. 

In the 1980s, social scientists 
resurrected Kant's theory with 
much fanfare, as empirical testing 
seemed to support its u~derlying 
idea, though with some caveats: No 
democracy has ever gone to war 
with another democracy. It also 
became a main pillar of the Clinton 
administration's foreign policy, 
which made the spread of dl:,ffioc-
racy a key component of ensuring 
America's defense. 

Since it carne into vogue, though, 

MANSFIELD lead to more more cautious one: "Urging a demo-

MONDAY, JANUARY 30, 2006 THE UCSD GUIIRDIAN SPORTS 11 

. First-Place Sonoma State Too 
Much for Inconsistent Tritons 
• BASKETBALL, from page 1 2 
three-pointer by the Gators' levon 
Doss ended the game with the nine-
point spread. 

Shooting 31 .6 percent from the 
field and 42.9 percent from the free-
throw line in the first half obviously 
led to UCSD's early struggles. but 
the Tritons rebounded by shoot-
ing 51.9 percent from the field and 
converting 85 percent of their free 
throws while holding the Gators to 
37 percent field -goal shooting in 
the second half. UCSD proved more 
efficient. committing 14 turnovers 
to San Francisco's 17, and won the 
rebounding battle 31 -29, en route to 
the comeback victory. 

Allard led the UCSD attack as 
one of three players in double-digits. 
scoring a game-high 16 pOints to go 
along with three asSists and three 
rebounds. while Lawlor came off the 
bench to score 14 points and record 
a game-high four assists . Fellow 
freshman forward Henry Patterson 
recorded 13 points and four steals 
during the game. The Gators were 
led in defeat by two players in dou-

b�e digits. with both starter Will 
Logan and reserve Doss scoring 12 
points. while Logan also grabbed a 
game-bigh eight boards. 

Before the second half heroics 
gave them their eighth overall win, 
the Tritons three-game winning 
streak. tied for the longest in the 
program's Division 11 history, came 
to an end on Ian. 27 at Seawolf Gym 
against Sonoma State. 

UCSD and Sonoma State battled 
early on. with the lead changing six: 
times in the first half. The Tritons 
showed they were very capable of 
battling with the CCAA elite. com-
ing back each time the Seawolves 
grabbed the lead to regain their 
positioning. A jumper by Poppen 
at the 1:44 mark gave UCSD a nine-

point advantage. the largest of the 
half. After two free throws by the 
Sea wolves' J.T, Tipton. UCSD forced 
two turnovers, but missed three 
shots. settling for a 3S-28 lead at 
the half. 

The Seawblves went on a 14-0 
run to open the second half, while 
the Tritons continued their cold 
streak from the end of the first half. 
missing their first three shots of the 
period. They turned the ball over 
twice before a layup by Patterson 
and a jumper by sophomore guard 
Andrew Hatch finally gave the 
Tritons some second-half offense. 
However, the Seawolves showed why 
they were undefeated in conference 
play, pushing their lead to 10 with 
just over five minutes played in the 
half. The 19 points Sonoma State 
scored after the break would out-
weigh the Triton offensive output for 
the entire half. as the Seawolf lead 
was never less than nine and reached 
17 by the fUlal buzzer. 

The Tritons had only one player 
in double figures on the evening 
as Patterson continued his impres-
sive freshman season, notching a 
new career h igh with 20 points. The 
CCAA field-goal percentage leader 
went 8-of-13 from the field and 4-
of-6 from the line. Allard also con-
tributed with nine points and three 
assists, while junior guard Robby 
Peters added seven points in a team-
high 27 minutes off the ben<;h. 

Next. the Tritons return home, 
where tbey are currently 4-1. UCSD 
will try to avenge two early sea· 
son losses. taking on Cal State Los 
Angeles on Feb. 3 during Spirit 
Night 2006. and facing Cal State 
Bakersfield on Feb. 4. The Tritons 
lost to both teams in the final sec-
onds of back-to-back games in early 
December, part of their season open-
ing nine-~arne road trip.

Tritons Go I-Ion Tough Road Series Women's Basketball Ups 
Win Streak to 10 Games U CSD men's basketball 

falls to CCAA-Ieading 
Sonoma State but pulls 
even with 65-56 win 
over Gators. 

By Joe Tevelowitz 
STAFF WRITER 

The UCSD men' basketball team 
spent the weekend in Northern 

alifornia, where it played two 
great halves in two games that left 
something to be desired. After a 
great first half against the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association -
leading Sonoma State, a cold -
shooting second half led to a 70-53 
Triton loss on Jan. 27. The tables 
fli pped on Jan . 28, with the Tritons 
sweet shot ab ent until intermis-
sion. After the break, however, the 
team put together a strong fin~1 
half in a 65-56 victory over San 
Franci co State that left UCSD with 
an 8- 10 overall record and a 5-5 
mark in CCAA competition . 

Against the Gators, UCSD found 
itself in a rut more common of the 
opponents who have had to face 
their own CCAA-Ieading d efense. 
With over 14 minutes played in 
the fi rst, the Tritons had only man-
aged seven points. Fortunately for 
UCSD, San Francisco State was 
unable to run away with the game, 
with its largest margin in the half 
at 12. Five different Tritons cored 
in the final five and a half minutes 
a UCSD went into the break down 
25- 17. 

The Tritons came out deter-
mined in the second hal'r. Unable 
to go on a remarkable run on either 
end, the Trit " ns instead attacked 
with steady basketball and proved 
relen tless as they slowly chipped 
away at the Gators' lead. Led by 
three three-pointerS from sopho: 
more guard Clint Allard, UCSD

took its first lead of the game, 41 -
40, with just over eight minuteS 
to play. From there, San Franci co 
State would hold close, but never 
again gain the lead. After allow-
ing the Gators back to within one 
with six minutes to play, UCSD 
went to freshman forward Darryl 
Lawlor, who nailed a jumper while 
being fouled and sunk the ensuing 
free-throw to complete the three-

point play. San Francisco State's 
Zack Johnson answered with two 
free throws on the other end, before 
another Triton freshnian, guard 
Shane Poppen, stepped up and 
scored four-straight UCSD points. 
The lead was never in serious jeop-
ardy after that point and would 
grow to as much as 12 before a

Tritons barely top 
Sonoma State 69-65 but 
blow-out Gators, 93-57, 
for No.2 ranking in 
West Region. 

By Nicky Buchanan 
STAFF WRITER 

II's no surprise that the Tritons, 
the No. 25 Division 11 team in the 
nation and the No. 2 team in the 
NCAA West Region, continue to 
breeze through their California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
competition. They bump opponents 
out of their comfort zones, and put 
themselves up in ran kings with ease 
night after night, including this past 
weekend, when their winning streak 
reached 10 games. While nerves 
flared up afLer the close call on Jan. 
27 when they barely came out on top 
against Sonoma State with a 69-65 
win, the game against San Francisco 
State on Jan. 28 was an entirely dif-
ferent story. The Tritons gai ned a 
secure lead early on and kept the 
Gators struggling until the bitter end 
when UCSD finally finished them 
off with an intimidating 93 -57 win. 

San Francisco State took the 
Tritons on a little ride at the tart 
of Saturday's game, as the .Gators 
pushed the Tritons behind by one 
point after only three minutes of 
play, but the Gators' lead was short-
lived. UCSD completed a 15-4 run 
over the next four minutes to lift 
the Tritons to a 10-point advantage, 
which they held firmly in their grasp 
for the remainder of the game. They 
led by 15 at halftime and scored 56 
points in the second half to come 
away with the win. 

Everybody chipped in for the 
victory_ Freshman forward Michelle 

Osier had a big night, scoring 16 
points and pulling in a career-high 
19 rebounds. Junior guard Leora 
Juster added 16 points, junior for-
ward Hillary Hansen contributed 14 
and junior guard Kim Buffum and 
freshman forward Meaghan Noud 
completed the double-digit-scoring 
pack with 12 and 11 points, respec-
tively. 

Juster and Osier again seemed to 
be the ringleaders this weekend, as 
they have in many of the Tritons' ear-
lier victories. Against Sonoma State, 
they combined for 46 pOints, despite 
a first half that saw the-Tritons 
deadlocked with the Seawolves at 33 
points at intermission. The halftime 
chat with head coach Janelle Jones 
proved effective, because the Tritons 
came out in the second .half on a 
20-7 run, which pushed them up by 
13 with 13 minutes remaining on 
the clock. The Sonoma State team 
fought hard to pull ahead and 'nearly 
did, but in the end they just couldn't 
break UCSD's rhythm. 

With the Tritons' 10-game win-
ning streak still alive and their 
momentum driving them to big 
wins, movement in the charts is 
only headed in- one direction: up. 
The Tritons improved to 14-2 over-
all and still remain tied with No. 17 
Cal State Bakersfield atop the CCAA 
standings with 9-1 league records. 
The Tritons will have a chance to 
separate themselves from Cal State 
Bakersfield when they play Cal State 
Los Angeles on Feb. 3 - a revenge 
game, as the Golden Eagle are the 
only team so far to beat them in 
CCAA play this season. Then the 
Tritons will face the team they are 
neck-and-neck with atop the league 
standings on Feb. 4. The Tritons will 
look to use homefield advantage to 
take sole possession of the CCAA 
league lead. 

No.3 Pepperdine, No. 13 USC Keep Volleyball Winless After Seven Games 
By Paul Choi 

TAFF WRITER 

T he UCSD men's volleyball team 
continued its winiess start, drop-
pi ng to 0-7 with losses to No. 3 
Pepperdine University. and No. 13 
University of Southern California in 
front of the home crowd on Jan. 27 
and Jan . 28, respectively. 

On Jan . 28, the Tritons lost in 
straight games to the Trojan , 22-
30, 27-30 and 27-30. With the win, 
USC improved to 4-4 overall and 
3-2 in the Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation. 

UCSD outblocked an opponent 
for the first time this season, but 
it wasn't enough to overcome the 
Tritons' timid play and USC sopho-
more outside hitter Juan Figueroa, 
who had 20 kills to go along with 
senior outside hitter and libero )oao 
Grangei ro's 15 kills. 

UCSD coach Kevin Ring wished 
his team could take advantage of a 
struggling Trojan team. 

"When we go back to serve I want 
them to play aggressive and find 
ways to score points," Ring said. 

The Trojans got off to an early 
tart in game one with a lead of 6-

13, but the Tritons made a run of 
their own to pull within three points. 
However, the lead was too much for 
UCSD to bounce back from, with 
the team eventually losing 22-30 on 
a USC kill. 

Throughout the night, the Tritons 
made hitting or service errors that 
ended their runs. 

"What concerns me is that we 
tlidn't serve the right guy," Ring said. 
"We didn't get the ball to No. 13 
lFigueroa], who wasn't passing the 

ball very well. Hitting errors are 
things that we just have to cut down 
on:' 

U SD again fell behind early in 
game two, trailing 4- 10 and later 
15-22. The Tritons showed how well 
they could play, putting together a 
run that brought them within three 
at 25-28 after junior middle blocker 
Garret Smith's kill. But another error 
and ultimately a service error would 
end the game in favor of the Trojans 
27-30. 

"[Serving is] all mental," Smith 
said . "We serve well in practice, we 
come out here and don't playas we . 
practiced it." 

Game three was very competitive, 
going back and forth between the two 
teams. The Tritons were down 14- 18 
when a small run cut the lead down 
to 22-24, with the help of Smith and 
sophomore outside hitter Russ Hardy. 
Again a good run was stopped by a 
ervice error. After senior outside 

hitter Jon Daze's kill brought UCSD 
within one at 25-26, USC refused to 
relinquish the lead. Finally, with the 
three Trojan fans holding out their 
'victory' sign (made popular by their 
football team), Figueroa ended the 
match 27-30 with a kill. 

"We were always playing from 
behind and we made a few plays, but 
unfortunately we were never in one 
of those three games," Ring said. 

Daze led the Tritons. with nine 
kills and a perfect reception per-
centage in 19 attempts. Smith also 
added nine kills against only one 
error. Junior setter Brooks Dierdorff 
had 36 assists despite senior opposite 
Chris Sayers, the team's kill leader, 
playing only a few minutes with one 
kill. 

" [Sayers] came in and made 
some errors tonight, but he's going to 
bounce back:' Ring said. "We got to 
get him going, we need his offense." 

UCSD faced No. 3 Pepperdine 
University the night before, lOSing in 
three games, 28-30, 19-30 and 25-30. 

"Regardless of who it is and what 
their ranking is, we need to play at a 
high level:' Ring said. 

Game one was close with neither 
team pulling away. TW9 Triton attack 
errors ended the game in favor of the 
Waves after a 28-28 tie. 

In game two, the score was tied 
at 9-9 when Pepperdine scored 11 
of th-e next 14 points to take a com-
manding lead. UCSD was not able to 
catch up, losing 19-30 on a freshman 
outside hitter Paul Carroll service 
ace. 

The Tritons played well in game 
three, even taking a 21 -17 lead, which 
forced the Waves to call a time out. 
Pepperdine quickly tied the game at 
21 -21 with a kill by senior middle 
blocker Andy Hein. The Waves went 
ahead with a comfortable lead until 
junior outside hitter John Parfitt put 
down the winning kill at 25-30. 

Senior opposite Brenden Bowe 
led UCSD with 10 kills, while Daze 
added nine. Hein led Pepperdine with 
15 kills against one attack error. 

Smith had eight kills for the 
Tritons on a .357 attacking percent-
age. 

"[Our performance] was average; 
we could've done better," Smith said. 
"We lacked intensity and baSically we 
need to keep our passing up higher in 
order to perform wele
