The UCSD Academic Senate, the 
governing on-campus body that dic-
tates policies on academic integrity 
and procedures, is currently con-
sidering revamping its policy on the 
accessibility of the withdrawal mark 
on academic transcripts.

Use of the withdrawal mark — 
denoted on transcripts as a “W” — is 
universal throughout the University 
of California system. This course 
mark is assigned to students who 
decide to drop a class between fifth 
week and the end of ninth week. 
The mark does not affect a student’s 
GPA, and the class may be retaken 
for a grade.

Currently, UCSD students may 
drop a class after the fourth week 
of class without any sort of petition 
process. The ease of the current 

withdrawal policy has raised con-
cerns of various faculty and admin-
istrative members, who brought 
their concerns to the Academic 
Senate. 

The Committee on Educational 
Policy, the committee in the 
Academic Senate that possesses 
grading jurisdiction, investigated 
the policy, and committee members 
have remained attentive to the pos-
sibility that students may be abus-
ing the grading option, which is 
designed for use as a last resort. 

Physics professor and CEP Chair 
Kim Griest said the senate has been 
mulling the “W” policy for several 
years to see if it needs updating. 

Though dropping a class later 
in a quarter may give a student 
another chance to improve his or 
her performance, it produces wasted 
space in sometimes overpopulated 
classrooms.

A.S. Associate Vice President of 
Academic Affairs Long Pham, who 
serves as the sole student repre-
sentative in the Academic Senate, 
brought the senate’s consideration 
of policy change to the A.S. Council 
at its Oct. 11 meeting. 

O.A.S.I.S. Survives Funding Drought

ERIK JEPSEN/GUARDIAN
O.A.S.I.S., which tutors students in subjects such as math, science and English as a second language, had its funding cut by $46,000 in 2006.

By Casey Lo
Staff Writer

Despite a drastically reduced 
budget, the Office of Academic 
Support and Instructional Services 
survived threats of closure last year, 
continuing to deliver a number of 
academic support services such as 
the Summer Bridge Program for 
freshmen, English as a second lan-

guage workshops and the highly 
popular math and science tutoring 
program to the student body.

Due to budget cuts to the Student 
Affairs Office ordered by former 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Joseph W. Watson, O.A.S.I.S. faced 
a $146,000 loss in funding in 2004-
05, as well as a permanent reduc-
tion of $46,000 the following year. 
However, research by a task force on 

the Coordination of Undergraduate 
Academic Support Services, charged 
with investigating academic student 
support services such as O.A.S.I.S., 
indicated a clear sentiment from 
academic departments and colleges 
that O.A.S.I.S. programs were vital 
to student success.

Campus Parking Gets Summer Makeover

By Kimberly Cheng
Associate News Editor

In an effort to ease congestion and 
facilitate access to campus, UCSD 
Transportation and Parking Services 
established several changes over sum-
mer, including the introduction of new 
parking structures and revised uses 
for those already in existence. While 
some of the changes have been met 
with support, others were greeted with 
skepticism by frustrated students try-
ing to adapt to the new schedules and 
restrictions.

The modifications made over sum-
mer are small steps toward a univer-
sitywide commitment to reduce car-
bon emissions, energy consumption 
and reliance on imported fossil fuels, 
T&PS Director Brian d’Autremont 
said.  

 One of the changes is an online 
tracking system for campus shuttles, 
designed to enhance transit efficiency 
and encourage students to use alter-
native forms of transportation. The 
Automatic Vehicle Location system 
works through a global positioning 
system unit installed in each shuttle, 
allowing students to track where the 
shuttles are on their routes in real time, 

along with the percentage of passen-
gers on the shuttle.

“AVL can keep buses spaced out 
and cut the time students spend wait-
ing,” d’Autremont said.

AVL is accessible through any Web-
enabled device on the Blink directory 
or at www.ucsdbus.com.

In 2004, during his tenure as asso-
ciate director of transportation services 
at UCLA, d’Autremont was president 
of a panel that sought to select a similar 
system for the university. However, the 
panel turned down an offer to imple-
ment a tracking system similar to the 
one used by UCSD.  

“UCLA now has a system, but 
it is only tracking by Nextel phone 
and not available as a database for

Athletics Dept. Hopes Fee Boost 
Will Sharpen Competitive Edge

By Katie Corotto
Contributing Writer

After the approval of last year’s 
undergraduate athletics fee ref-
erendum, the UCSD Athletics 
Department is now utilizing its 
$3-million boost to increase team 
budgets, raise coaches’ salaries and 
provide new student-athlete schol-
arships, furthering its rags-to-riches 
quest to make the school a com-
petitive member of Division II col-
legiate sports. 

Last year, 56 percent of the more 
than 9,000 students participating in 
the special election voted to alleviate 
the department’s $300,000 debt by 
increasing the student-paid grant-
in-aid fee to $329 a year. The highly 
contentious special election culmi-
nated in 4,991 students voting for 
and 3,948 students voting against 
the referendum, despite the A.S. 
special elections committee prohib-
iting campaigning right before the 
vote by referendum supporters, after 
it found them guilty of violating 
election bylaws regarding campaign 

zones and use of council materials. 
The increased athletics fee provides 
roughly $3.6 million to the depart-
ment, a budget that is now being 
strategically allocated to UCSD’s 23 
intercollegiate teams. 

The referendum initially out-
lined the department’s goals if the 
fee was approved, citing the major 
renovations that the possible budget 
would facilitate as an argument for 
its passage. 

However, the department main-
tains full control of where the money 
goes and how it is spent.

“We’ve been moving cautious-
ly this year, as there are a lot of 

Bulk of $3-million 
athletics referendum 
windfall being spent on 
salaries, individual team 
budgets.

UCSD Medical Center 
Joins Lung Disease Study

The National Heart, Lung and 
Blood Institute provided UCSD 
Medical Center with a $37-million 
grant to be used to conduct a com-
prehensive study of chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease, the fourth 
leading cause of death in the United 
States.  

The medical center is one of only 
16 clinical study centers nationwide 
selected to participate in the trial. Its 
goal is to identify the genetic, epide-
miological and radiological charac-
teristics of COPD.  

The study, led by the National 
Jewish Medical and Research Center 
and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, 
will provide a better understanding of 
the disease and shed light on more 
effective treatments.  

“This study will help us determine 
why some smokers get COPD and 
others do not,” Joe Ramsdell, direc-
tor of the division of general internal 
medicine, geriatrics and professor of 
clinical medicine at the UCSD School 
of Medicine, said in a press release. 
“We want to understand the specific 
genetic factors that protect a particu-
lar smoker or make someone else 
more susceptible. We look forward 
to a day when medical teams are 
no longer cleaning up the damage 
caused by COPD but intervening 
early enough to initiate individualized 
therapy.”

COPD encompasses a variety 
of progressive lung diseases, most 
commonly emphysema and chronic 
bronchitis, which damage lung tis-
sue and cause breathing difficulties. 
The primary cause of COPD cases is 
cigarette smoking.  

However, inhaling other kinds of 
lung irritants may also cause the 
disease.  

UC Faculty Appointed to 
Institute of Medicine

Along with 65 new members, four 
UC staff members were elected to 
the National Academies’ Institute of 
Medicine.  

Regarded as one of the highest 
honors bestowed upon professionals 
in the fields of medicine and health, 
membership is determined by cur-
rent active members. Candidates are 
nominated based on their profes-
sional achievements and commit-
ment to service.

Out of the current 1,538 active 
members, 163 of them are affiliated 
with the University of California.  

Webster K. Cavanee, director 
of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer 
Research and distinguished profes-
sor, represents UCSD as one of the 
institute’s newest members.  

“I congratulate these members 
on their accomplishments and their 
dedication to public service,” Wyatt 
R. Hume, UC provost and execu-
tive vice president for academic 
and health affairs, said in a press 
release. 

Other newly elected UC members 
from UCLA and UC San Francisco 
include a cancer researcher, a chief 
of emergency medicine and a neurol-
ogy professor.  

The function of the Institute of 
Medicine is to provide scientifically 
informed analysis and independent 
recommendations to the nation’s 
policymakers, professionals and 
leaders in the areas of health and 
science.

Spirit Group’s Purchase Divides Council

By Michael Bowlus
Senior Staff Writer

Campus spirit group Triton 
Tide’s purchase of sexually sug-
gestive novelty foam fingers over 
summer came under scrutiny by 
A.S. councilmembers at their Oct. 
17 meeting, where they debated 
and ultimately passed a finance bill 
granting the group an additional 
$4,000 to buy more merchandise.

The $2,100 shipment of foam fin-
gers arrived at the start of the school 
year and was immediately prevented 
from distribution upon inspection 
by A.S. President Marco Murillo 
and Vice President of Finance and 
Resources Sarah Chang. 

The foam fingers resembled 
a sexual hand gesture known as a 
“shocker,” which is similar to a trident 
hand gesture that UCSD fans wave at 
athletic events.

The novelty items have since been 
put into a trash compactor.

“My reaction was, ‘Oh my God, 
what just happened?’” Chang said of 
her first sighting of the foam fingers. 
“We saw a few reactions from female 
students and staff workers ... and an 
executive decision was made not to 
distribute [them].”

Murillo said the fingers’ gesture 
was also not what he had envisioned 
as the design.

Chang said after she and Murillo 
spoke with Triton Tide Director 
Dave Payne, they greed on sponsor-
ing $4,000 finance bill for the spirit 
club in order to allow Triton Tide to 
buy appropriate custom-made foam 
fingers. The bill passed by a vote of 

13-9-3.
The discussion between Chang 

and Payne became part of the debate 
about the additional funding.

“[Payne] was promised $4,000 to 
purchase new foam fingers,” said All-
Campus Senator Meghan Clair, a sup-
porter of the item. “From that I for-
mulated my decision that it would be 
in the best interest of A.S. [Council] 
to give the money to Triton Tide.”

Chang refuted claims that she 
had promised money to Payne, and 
reiterated that she had told him that 
the finance bill would be on the 
agenda but a majority vote by the 
council would decide whether the 
funding would be granted.

At the meeting, Thurgood 
Marshall College Senator Kyle Samia 
joined Associate Vice President of 
Academic Affairs Long Pham in 
strongly opposing the finance bill, 
and the two still stand by their 
objections.

“Clearly, there was a lack of judg-
ment … [but] no one is out there to 
get Triton Tide,” Samia said. “We 
just want Triton Tide to be held 
accountable.”

Samia characterized the incident 
as one of fiscal irresponsibility and 
poor leadership, questioning Payne’s 
decision-making ability.

“It’s really, really irresponsible,” 
he said. “What does that say about 

us if we fund people flippantly? 
[Payne] didn’t show anyone any-
thing … he just bought them. When 
Triton Tide makes a mistake, they 
shouldn’t be pardoned. There are 
some people who have no concept 
of students’ money.”

Samia noted a lack of commu-
nication sur-
rounding the 
purchase of the 
foam fingers. 
He said that 
when the coun-
cil endorsed 
Payne’s idea of 
buying foam 
fingers late last 
school year, 
there was no 
further discussion about which 
foam fingers to purchase. 

Triton Tide followed through 
with the purchase plans by buying 
foam fingers from a retailer who 
specializes in “shocker” merchan-
dise, Samia said.

Although Samia saw the coun-
cil’s willingness to let Payne make 
the buying decision on his own as 
a “big misplacement of trust,” Clair 
said that Payne shouldn’t be blamed 
for making a decision on which no 
one else provided input.

“No one except Dave had been 
involved in purchasing them,” 
she said. “I hope that the people 
who found them inappropriate are 
involved in the purchase of the new 
fingers.”

Clair said Triton Tide has already 
allocated its funding for this year, 
which is why it did not have its own 
additional funding to draw on to 
replace the unusable fingers.

“Other student organizations 
received additional funding this fall 
too,” she said.

at mbowlus@ucsd.edu.

He said that the senate is consid-
ering restricting the accessibility of 
withdrawing from a class, based on 
a review of withdrawal policies at 
other UC campuses.

CEP dedicated a significant 
amount of its research to gather-
ing information from other UC 
campuses about their withdrawal 
policies, and found that they vary 
widely from campus to campus, 
Pham said.

UC Berkeley and UC Irvine 
require students to fill out a petition 
form and give a valid reason for 
withdrawing, whereas UC Riverside, 
like UCSD, does not require a peti-
tion process.

According to Griest, many fac-
ulty members and administrators 
have expressed strong concerns 
about students easily withdraw-
ing from classes and retaking them 
multiple times. 

Griest has recommended that a 
formal subcommittee be formed to 
research UCSD’s withdrawal policy 
to find if there is a legitimate prob-
lem.

The proposal was rejected by  

CEP, which determined such deci-
sions would be made during its 
meetings. No changes have yet 
taken place, and research into the 
matter is likely to occur throughout 
the year.

“The CEP is only at a very early 
data-gathering stage in this pro-

cess — determining the frequency 
and pattern of ‘W’ option usage at 
UCSD, as well as seeing how this 
compares to what is conducted at 
the other UC campuses,” Academic 
Senate Chair Jim Posakony said. “At 
this point, it is very unclear whether 

CEP will propose any change to 
the ‘W’ option at all, and there’s 
certainly no existing proposal to 
do so.”

Some students value the policy’s 
current flexibility, which allows 
them to make last-minute decisions 
without bureaucratic delay.

“Restricting the ‘W’ option 
is a bad idea,” Eleanor Roosevelt 
College junior Madeline Phillips 
said. “So many circumstances could 
lead to a student deciding to with-
draw from a class.”

Other students worry that 
restricting the policy could harm 
students dealing with extenuating 
circumstances that affect their aca-
demic performance.

“Students do not always take a 
‘W’ just because they are slacking off 
in a class,” Roosevelt senior Kayta 
Orlova said. “It may be because 
of sudden circumstances such as a 
death in the family, or because they 
realize they just have too much on 
their plate, which sometimes can-
not be foreseen.”

O.A.S.I.S. were no longer dis-
cussed.

So far, O.A.S.I.S. has managed 
to operate smoothly, relative to its 
new budget parameters. According 
to Rabia Paracha, former A.S. vice 
president of academic affairs and 
undergraduate representative to 
UGASS, the math and science tutor-
ing program has been so popular that 
it has had to turn students away. 

However, O.A.S.I.S. is restrict-
ed to being a basic tutoring pro-
gram that cannot fully respond 
to the needs of a growing student 
body, Paracha said. For example, 
O.A.S.I.S. offers writing tutorials 
for students in ESL or Subject A, 
but does not have the resources to 
implement a more comprehensive 
program to serve native English 
speakers who need help in college 
writing courses.

Patrick Velasquez, director of 
O.A.S.I.S., said that academic sup-
port should be based on a culture 
of excellence, and that it would be 
disastrous for O.A.S.I.S. to become 
a program relegated to remedial 
help only. 

The budget downsizing has also 
affected resource options for upper 
division math, chemistry and ser-
vices for transfer students.

However, Velasquez said 
O.A.S.I.S. has suffered the most 
from students’ perceptions that its 
services had been impaired by the 
budget cuts more than they actu-
ally were. 

The image of O.A.S.I.S. as an 
abandoned and underfunded pro-
gram seriously hurt its ability to 
recruit tutors when in reality, most 
of O.A.S.I.S.’ previous services are 
still being offered, with the excep-
tion of the study skills program, 
Velasquez said.  

Paracha said that possible solu-
tions to alleviate the effects of the 

cutbacks are still being evaluated. 
Specifically, there have been sug-
gestions to move O.A.S.I.S., cur-
rently a program under the Student 
Affairs Office, to the division of 
Academic Affairs, where there 
appears to be a greater willingness 
to put more time and resources 
into the program.

In addition, regular meetings 
with the vice chairs for under-
graduate affairs and O.A.S.I.S. staff  
are necessary in order to keep the 
administration informed of aca-
demic support services, she said. 
The administration can in turn 

coordinate communication between 
O.A.S.I.S., academic departments 
and colleges to ensure that over-
laps in services between these three 
branches can be integrated to reduce 
overall costs.

There has been considerable 
debate on whether UCSD should 
gear academic support services 
toward incoming freshmen who 
require additional assistance and 
encouragement in their first year, or 
spread services throughout the rest 
of the student body to promote a 
higher academic bar. In a discussion 
with Paracha, Watson was very ada-
mant about structuring O.A.S.I.S. 
to fit the needs of underclassmen 
— not senior students. 

However, Watson dealt a crip-

pling blow to the office’s Community 
for Learning and Academic Success 
program, which provides counsel-
ing, networking and tutoring work-
shops to freshmen, when he cut 
$100,000 two years ago.

“The temporary funds to run 
CLAS were eliminated because for-
mer Vice Chancellor Watson lost 
interest in serving a broad degree 
of new freshmen who would benefit 
from services that facilitate their 
transition to UCSD,” Velasquez said 
in an e-mail.

Paracha, on the other hand, said 
that academic support should be 
spread out evenly among all UCSD 
students.

“As students, some days are good 
and others are bad and there is no 
telling whether our bad days will 
come earlier on in our education or 
whether we will encounter obstacles 
later on in our years at UCSD,”  
Paracha said. “For this reason, all 
academic support services should 
be geared toward all students.”

John Muir College sophomore 
Jeremy Lee, who uses O.A.S.I.S. as a 
study tool for his chemistry courses, 
said that the office is a valuable 
resource for students enrolled in 
historically difficult math and sci-
ence classes.

“It kind of cements some of the 
things you hear in lecture, and it 
goes a little bit faster than lecture, 
too, so you don’t get lost,” he said.

However, Lee said that long wait 
lists are problematic for the large 
number of students who need help 
in particular courses, but that off-
setting the cuts in funding would 
likely allevite that problem.

“More funding could maybe 
allow them to hire more people and 
get people off the huge wait lists,” 
he said.

parts to the program that need 
attention,” Senior Associate Director 
of Athletics Ken Grosse said. “The 
election proved successful in open-
ing up a dialogue with the students 
to find problems. Now we can cor-
rect those problems and create the 
best program possible.”

The department has increased 
the operating budget of each of the 
23 teams to assist with travel expen-
ditures, purchasing new equipment 
and uniforms, and secondary health 
insurance — costs that students and 
their parents used to pay — that the 
program had previously compro-
mised due to budget deficiencies. 
Each team is permitted to use its 
budget at its own discretion, and 
some teams may have additional 
costs, Grosse said.  

The department has also hired 
another full-time athletic trainer in 

addition to the two already staffed, 
allowing for full accommodations 
for the more than 600 student-ath-

letes to train safely with staff super-
vision. 

Moreover, staff salaries have 
been increased, with the earnings 
of the 20 head coaches raised by 

20 percent and the wages of the 
assistant coaches also augmented to 
cover the high cost of living in San 
Diego. 

“Our coaches were very under-
paid before this year,” Grosse said. 
“We basically paid our full-time 
coaches part-time wages. We were 
at the bottom of the scale in our 
conference in terms of salary.”

This year’s fiscal budget will also 
be utilized to pay the $800,000 loan 
used to complete Canyonview Pool. 
By addressing these costs this year, 
the department hopes to free up 
the budget for long-term planning 
improvements to other areas of the 
program, including publicity and 
marketing to get students interested 
in attending games, conferences and 
tournaments, Grosse said.

management purposes,” d’Autremont 
said. “They are looking at adapting 
[UCSD’s] system in 2008.”

While d’Autremont seeks to boost 
the use of public transportation, 
numerous other sites on campus are 
undergoing construction, including 
the North Campus Housing project 
that will encompass parking lots P-355 
and P-356.  Both of the lots are cur-
rently home to student parking spaces.  

Overnight parking in Gilman 
Parking Structure has also been elimi-
nated, a move necessary to realign the 
structure’s function with its original pur-
pose, according to A.S. Transportation 
and Parking Committee representative 
Alex Miller.

“Gilman is a commuter-minded 
structure that was being occupied by 
resident students,” Miller said. 

About 94 percent of the parking 
spaces in Gilman were used for stor-
age — overnight parking for students 
living on campus.

“The way it operated was unfair to 
students who park there for classes,” 
d’Autremont said. “I have received 
positive comments about this change 
predominantly from students.”

Two floors of student spaces were 
also eliminated from Gilman, a change 
to which students were not necessarily 
as receptive.

“I don’t understand the changes,” 
Thurgood Marshall College senior 
Robert Cordoni said. “Parking on 
campus used to be more convenient 
for me. It’s such a hassle to get to 
campus now. Buses are always over-
crowded, and now finding parking is 
more difficult.”

D’Autremont hopes that the new 
$30-million Hopkins Parking Structure 
will alleviate student parking issues 
caused by these changes. However, the 
cost of building such a structure has 
inevitably increased permit prices.  

“The true cost of a lot is $275 [per 
space] per month,” d’Autremont said 
of the Hopkins structure.

Completed for use in September 
and located near RIMAC Arena and 
the San Diego Supercomputer Center, 
Hopkins contains 1,406 parking spac-
es. About 800 of those spaces are 
reserved for undergraduate students, 
and overnight parking is permitted.  

After building Hopkins, there will 
be no new “S” spaces on west campus 
unless another parking structure is 
built, which would further increase 
parking permit prices, d’Autremont 
said.

An Oct. 19 public forum regard-
ing the Hopkins Parking Structure 
presented an opportunity for students 
to voice their opinions and concerns 

about a possible temporary reallo-
cation of parking spaces within the 
structure.

“We want to gather input before 
making any decisions,” d’Autremont 
said.  “This is one way for us to com-
municate better.”

D’Autremont revealed at the forum 
that Hopkins currently contains 107 
“A” spaces, 368 “B” spaces and 808 “S” 
spaces.  During peak use, all “S” spaces 
are filled while 318 “A” and “B” spaces 
remain empty.  

Since faculty and graduate spaces 
are not being completely occupied, the 
parking reallocation will open more 
spaces to students. The proposed space 
redistribution will be 92 “A” spaces, 233 
“B” spaces and 958 “S” spaces.

After taking away faculty and grad-
uate spaces, the department’s goal is to 
leave a 70-space cushion for “B” spaces 
and a 40-space cushion for “A” spaces.

During the forum, d’Autremont 
also expressed the need to make park-
ing spaces more contiguous for safety. 
The new space allotment will add 306 
“S” spaces to levels one and two in 
Hopkins while 156 “B” spaces will be 
added to levels five, six and seven. The 
consolidation of spaces will eliminate 
the need for drivers to hunt for spaces 
in different parts of the structure.  

In addition, East Parking and 
Regents Express shuttles will be com-
bined into a single East/Regents shut-
tle, effective Oct. 25. Consolidation of 
the two routes is meant to increase the 
frequency of service while saving the 
costs of fuel.   

Last spring, there were 1,725 
“A” parking spaces, 4,800 “B” spac-
es and 6,331 “S” spaces on campus. 
After the changes made during sum-
mer, there are now 1,826 “A” spaces, 
5,305 “B” spaces and 6,219 “S” spaces, 
d’Autremont said. 

He added that the summertime 
changes, as well as future plans, 
emphasize the need for environmental 
awareness among students and staff at 
UCSD. Getting students out of their 
cars and encouraging them to uti-
lize alternative forms of transportation 
such as the free shuttles and buses will 
cut back on air pollution as well as 
parking issues. 

D’Autremont said that transpor-
tation and parking operations differ 
greatly between UCSD and UCLA.

“At UCLA, essentially, undergrads 
get no parking,” d’Autremont said.  
“The shuttle system is minimal com-
pared to UCSD.  Their [Metropolitan 
Transport Authority] system is more 
advanced compared to UCSD’s.”

ties, including the baseball field, 
are in need of renovation, Grosse 
said that the department will rely 
primarily on fundraising and dona-
tions to cover the costs, as most 
of the department’s new budget is 
focused on the student-athletes and 
their growth. 

“It was tough to maintain morale 
with no funds for travel, equipment 
and other expenses,” he said. “We 
just couldn’t afford to do the things 
other teams could, but now our 
athletes know that the school sup-
ports them and it’s shown in their 
performance.”

The athletics 
program has also 
budgeted $250,000 
for student-athlete 
scholarships, man-
datory for a NCAA 
D-II status, which 
were not previ-
ously funded.

This year, each 
athlete will receive 
a $500 scholarship, 
and although the 
NCAA requires 
only a 2.0 minimum GPA to be on a 
team, the Athletics Department and 
the Student Affairs Office have coordi-
nated a new grant-in-aids stipulation 
that requires students to maintain a 
2.5 GPA during their first year, 2.6  
after their second year and a 2.7 after 
their third year at UCSD.

This new requirement corre-
sponds with the academic tradi-
tion of UCSD athletes, according 
to Stephanie Chang, A.S. associate 
vice president of athletic relations 
and member of the women’s crew 
team. 

“As one of the most rigorous 
academic institutions in the United 

States, more than 60 percent of the 
more than 600 student-athletes carry 
cumulative GPAs of 3.0 or above 
and the average GPA of that group 
is routinely higher than the aver-
age of the student body at-large,” 
Chang said in an e-mail. “The ath-
letic department has always prided 
itself in its student-athletes.”

Grosse said the athletics depart-
ment will pursue the implementa-
tion of various fiscal changes as it 
gauges where the money is needed 
most. But, it hopes that students 
will continue to support athletes as 
the year progresses.

Triton Tide 
Director Dave 
Payne said the 
student support 
of athletics has 
already begun to 
show. 

Attendance 
at many sport-
ing events, 
including water 
polo and bas-
ketball, has 
gone up, and 
students are 

more engaged in the games and sta-
tus of their favorite teams. 

“Sports are important because 
they give students something to 
rally behind, something to believe 
in, something to get really excited 
about,” Payne said in an e-mail. 
“It gives them bragging rights and 
makes things a lot more fun. Yes, we 
have awesome academics, but who 
goes home and brags about rankings 
to their friends? There is more to 
what you get from college than your 
education.”

STUDENT LIFE — At its Oct. 17 meeting, the A.S. Council 
approved a $4,000 funding allocation for Triton Tide — as 
though the now $3.6 million athletics budget (thanks to last 
year’s fee referendum) and the already-allotted $13,400 of 
council money just wasn’t enough. 

This recent allotment is particularly surprising, as it comes 
from a council that, just last year, made strides to stop fund-
ing duplication. In fact, the 2007-08 budget approval meeting 
spurred great debate over Triton Tide specifically, because the 
council gave the organization $4,100 less than it had the previ-
ous year. However, it appears that in light of an overwhelming 
$264,000 carryover, the council has decided to throw logic to 
the wind, kneeling to Triton Tide’s ever-persistent leader Dave 
Payne.

What makes the $4,000 truly aggravating are the circum-
stances under which it was allotted. Months ago (and without 
proper approval) Triton Tide ordered foam fingers to distribute 
at games. But this wasn’t just any we’re-number-one, run-of-
the-mill type spirit gear. Classy as they are, UCSD’s elite spirit 
crew ordered $2,000 worth of blue-and-gold UCSD fingers, 
specially molded into the “shocker” gesture. That’s right, noth-
ing says school pride like an obscene hand motion. And though 
the group claimed the design was meant to represent a trident, 
anyone who has gone to a UCSD basketball game (“Shock ’em 
Tritons!”) knows this is a transparent defense of the signal’s 
true meaning.

Fast-forward to the fingers’ arrival and Payne sat beaming 
over his brilliant idea. It was A.S. President Marco Murillo and 
A.S. Vice President of Finance and Resources Sarah Chang 
that had to break it to Payne that it’s generally best not to use 
explicit or offensive signs to represent yourself, the university 
or your school pride.

The fingers were reportedly nixed — $2,000 taken from 
student pockets and sent to the trash compactor — and Payne, 
rather than realizing his egregious mistake and apologizing 
for his flagrant abuse of money, complained for replacement 
funds and threatened to pass out the peppy contraband despite 
unequivocal directions not to do so. 

Apparently trying to ameliorate an unruly Payne, Chang and 

Let me be one of the first to admit: We college kids are a rather pretentious and arro-
gant bunch. 

Most of us love feigning that 
we’ve been around the block a few 
times, acting like we know what 
we’re doing with our lives and criti-
cizing everyone around us because 

we clearly know better than the 
rest of the world. We also enjoy 
deluding ourselves by thinking that 
we’re the most cultured, globally 
concerned, politically knowledge-
able and talented group of scholars 
out there. To be frank, in spite of all 
our book-smarts, the majority of us 
shouldn’t be giving ourselves that 
much credit. 

I, too, have often fallen into this 
unsavory category of overconfident, 
self-entitled university students. I 
hardly ever fail to find a good excuse 
as to why my teachers are completely 
unjust in their grading systems, and  
hardly acknowledge advice from 
friends and family because I like to 
believe that I’m always right. In fact, 
it took an entire summer of being 
emerged in the culture and lifestyle 
of a foreign country before I finally 
began to realize how little I actually 
knew about the world. 

Fortunately, this startling real-
ization was one of the most reward-
ing and enlightening experiences 
that I could hope for, and I can’t say 
that the rest of my ever-so-brilliant 
and culturally-aware colleagues 
wouldn’t benefit from the same sort 
of experience. 

For a great number of us, it is

STUDENT CENTERS AND 
HEALTH — In the past few weeks, 
students across the nation have 
been exposed to virulent outbreaks 
of staph infection, including a 
deadly strain of methicillin-resis-
tant Staphylococcus aureus know 
as MRSA. But it wasn’t until Oct. 
16, when the death of a senior at 
Staunton River High School in 
Moneta, Va. prompted student pro-
tests, that the true magnitude and 
dangers of staph infections in the 
United States were brought to the 
public eye. 

According to reports from doc-
tors at the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, nearly 
19,000 people in the United States 

died in 2005 from MRSA infections 
— exceeding the number of deaths 
attributed to A.I.D.S., Parkinson’s 
disease, emphysema or homicide 
each year. New evidence from the 
American Medical Association sug-
gests that cases of the antibiotic-
resistant MRSA infections may be 
twice as prevalent as previously 
imagined. 

In view of these recent reports, 
it’s disappointing that local health 
and education officials weren’t the 
first to shed light on this threat at 
Virginia high schools, but instead 
waited for student protestors to be 
the proponents of disinfecting facil-
ities and preventing the spread of 
this potentially lethal strain of bac-
teria. In light of recent outbreaks, it 
is time for officials in Virginia and 
throughout the country to treat this 
situation with the caution and grav-
ity it warrants.

The severity of these staph infec-
tions shouldn’t be taken lightly — 
the current strain of MRSA circulat-
ing in schools across the nation does 
not respond to penicillin and other 
related antibiotics. The infection 
can be spread easily by skin-to-skin 

contact or through sharing hygiene 
items (such as towels or razors) used 
by infected persons, especially those 
with open wounds. Considering 
there were 11 other reported MRSA 
cases throughout southern Virginia 
in the six months leading up to the 
most recent student death, it comes 

as a great upset that schools did not 
make greater efforts to caution stu-
dents and prevent infections.

 At Staunton River High School, 
students took matters into their own 
hands by organizing a protest over-
night on Oct. 15 using text messages 

and social networking Web sites. 
They brought the Bedford County 
School Superintendent on a tour of 
the school on Oct. 16 to show him 
the filthy conditions of their facili-
ties — especially the locker rooms, 
a common area for student-athletes 
to contract staph infections. The 
students’ efforts encouraged county 
officials to disinfect Staunton River 
and 21 surrounding high schools 
in an effort to prevent further out-
breaks. 

It is discouraging that health and 
education officials failed to initially  
take greater preventative measures. 
Fortunately, the staph infection cases 
in Virginia were promptly addressed 
after they were discovered, but had 
people been more informed, it may 
have been possible to prevent the 
Richmond student’s death. 

According to reports, the stu-
dent’s mother said that her son was 
originally sent home from the hos-
pital after doctors ruled out appen-
dicitis as the cause for his severe 
stomach pains. 

He was readmitted after a few 
days, but wasn’t diagnosed with 
MRSA until the staph infection had 

spread to his kidneys, heart and 
lungs. By then, it was already too 
late. 

If schools and medical facilities 
throughout the area are made more 
aware of recent bacterial outbreaks, 
it may be possible to discover MRSA 
infection sooner so that future 
patients can receive the proper drug 
treatments quickly. 

Considering that student MRSA 
infection have already been a prob-
lem in Virginia, Maryland, Ohio, 
Florida and Illinois, it is not unrea-
sonable for schools in other states 
to inform their students about the 
dangers of staph infections. 

In order to ensure infections 
won’t continue to spread throughout 
the nation, student health centers 
should provide more information to 
educate students about the severity 
of these bacterial strains and what 
can be done to detect and pre-
vent future infections. Additionally, 
schools should take their own mea-
sures to promote clean environ-
ments instead of hot-spot bacteria-
infested areas such as locker rooms, 
where infections are most often con-
tracted.

Story Misrepresents 
Plight of Local Immigrants

Dear Editor,
  I am writing in response to 

Nathan Miklos’ Oct. 15 article 
titled “D.R.E.A.M. Act Encourages 
Double Standard but Lacks Effective 
Immigration Solution.” Miklos’ 
piece is brimming with factual inac-
curacies and logical fallacies. His 
entire argument hinges on the ill-
informed claim that undocumented 
immigrants do not pay taxes and 
therefore should not be given the 
same benefits as “taxpayers.” It is 
widely known that most undocu-
mented immigrants do pay large 
sums of money to federal and state 
governments. 

For example, federal income 
taxes that cannot be matched to 
workers’ names and social security 
numbers grew $20 billion between 
1990 and 1998. This surplus con-
tinues to grow $6 billion a year 
with 2005’s sitting at $519 billion. 
It is largely attributed to undocu-
mented immigrant laborers whose 
employers deduct income taxes and 
social security payments from their 
checks to avoid being scrutinized by 
authorities. In terms of social secu-
rity, these workers will never receive 
what they paid.

 According to a study by con-
servative Cato Institute’s economist 
Steve Moore, immigrant households 
in 1997 paid an estimated $133 bil-
lion in direct taxes to federal, state 
and local governments. Douglas 
Massey, a Princeton professor and 
expert on Mexican migrants, has 

found that  “illegal migrants pay 
taxes at high rates while using pub-
lic services at low rates.” Among the  
2,100 undocumented immigrants 
he surveyed, “60 percent of them 
said they had federal taxes withheld 
from their pay.” Meanwhile, only 4 
percent said they used food stamps 
and 3 percent said they received 
government welfare payments. In 
addition, only 11 percent reported 
that they send their children to U.S. 
public schools. Also, only 26 percent 
said they used a U.S. hospital.

Miklos claimed that all undocu-
mented students who would benefit 
from the California D.R.E.A.M. Act 
are guilty of committing crimes and 
therefore should not be rewarded. 
He neglects to mention that many 
of these individuals were brought 
to the United States by their parents 
when they were minors. They were 
not directly responsible for crossing 
illegally and as such, morally speak-
ing, should not be held accountable 
for their parents’ infractions. 

Opposing the California 
D.R.E.A.M. Act is not only unjust 
but impractical. Our state needs 
more college graduates. According 
to the Public Policy Institute of 
California, 41 percent of jobs will 
require a college education by 2025 
but only 32 percent of workers in 
the state will have college degrees. 

Miklos advocated treating peo-
ple equally but he contradicts him-
self, arguing that undocumented 
students should not get the same 
chance that “legal” Americans get.  
Hard-working students, most of 
whom are only guilty of involun-
tarily committing a misdemeanor 
— entering the country illegally is 

a minor offense — should not be 
treated as second-class persons. 

Miklos stated he is against “cre-
ating an institutional double-stan-
dard between legal citizens and 
undocumented residents.” The only 
double standard here is the one that 
marginalizes undocumented immi-
grants, not because they are “bad” 
but because they are cheap, expend-
able labor and concomitantly, tend 
to speak with a different accent or 
language and have a darker shade 
of skin.

No Merit for Proposed 
Warren Fee Increase

Dear Editor,
“Warren is really suffering.”  

Those were the words of Brandon 
Blades, a former Warren College 
Student Council official in charge 
of passing the 2004 fee referendum 
who also called the vote a do-or-die 
time for the college.

Warren College can hardly claim 
to be suffering anymore. After 
spending its first three decades 
of existence begging for handouts 
from the campuswide student gov-
ernment, Warren College decided 
to tax its own students less than 
four years ago, tripling its student 
council’s budget and becoming the 
last college to adopt an activity fee.  
And although Warren College has 
survived just fine without any activ-
ity fees for its first 30 years, here we 
are in 2007, with its student council 

lining up for more money.
Let us consider the arguments 

offered by WCSC Parliamentarian 
Dan Palay in a recent Guardian 
article:

1. “Warren has the lowest activ-
ity fee on campus.” Well, Warren 
College also has the second most 
students of UCSD’s six colleges. 
Since the cost of events like concerts 
and dances are fixed — why would 
it cost muchmore to put on a dance 
for Warren College’s 4,132 students 
than for Sixth College’s 2,783? — it 
makes sense for Warren College to 
have the lowest activity fee. Though 
the per-student contribution is 
smaller, the total pie is still big.

2. “The fee hasn’t increased 
since it began.” OK, the fee was 
first assessed in 2004. So, in this 
three-year period of low inflation, 
how much purchasing power has 
the council really lost? In that same 
time period, the UC-wide tuition has 
grown precipitously and the student 
government has heavily criticized 
the increases. Isn’t it hypocritical 
for the same student government 
to now come back to the trough for 
more?

3. “Warren Live! should be self-
sufficient, in case the A.S. Council 
someday decides to cut off fund-
ing.” Warren College students vote 
in campus-wide elections, and with 
a fifth of all votes, they certainly 
have clout to keep the A.S. spigot 
on. If not, why not wait until the 
day actually comes to ask for more 
money? (Also, if the goal is to assure 
self-sufficiency for the concert, why 
raise an additional $16,000 for unre-
lated programming for the events 
board and the commuter commis-

sion?)
It sounds like Palay thinks the 

council has other meritorious 
funding needs. Isn’t it time to stop 
spending thousands of dollars a 
year on newspapers that students 
could get online for free? (If things 
got really tough, the council could 
also sell the piano it bought during 
the spending spree it went on the 
first year the activity fee largesse 
rolled in. Or not hold its outra-
geously expensive council retreat 
each year, which the Guardian has 
amply documented.)

It may be that Warren College 
students believe the time has come 
for them to invest more money in 
the quality of their college’s under-
graduate life. But they should do so 
out of a genuine preference for more 
programming, and with a specific 
spending plan, not because of stu-
dent politicians’ scare tactics.

6  OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN MONDAY, OCTOBER 22, 2007

Murillo appeased greedy hands by 
sponsoring a finance committee bill 
that increased Triton Tide’s funding 
by $4,000; $2,000 to replace money 
already spent on the original fingers 
and order new ones, and $2,000 more 
for “rush shipping” — and whatever 
else Payne fancies. This brings the 
council’s contribution to Triton Tide 
to a total of $17,400, just $100 less 
than last year’s allotment. So much 
for not duplicating funds.

Then on Oct. 17 the council, friv-
olous and blase 
from their unusu-
ally large carry-
over, approved the 
bill 13-9-3.

Now regardless 
of the implication 
of the shocker, or 
the appropriate-
ness thereof, the 
bottom line is that 
Payne’s fiscal irre-
sponsibility and a 
complete lack of 
council oversight 
has forced Triton Tide to throw away 
$2,000 of students’ money. But rather 
than being reprimanded like the mis-
behaving child it is, the group’s A.S. 
Council parent organization gave that 
spoiled brat a $2,000 reward.

Forget the initial questions: what 
could Payne have possibly been think-
ing when he ordered something so 
obviously distasteful? And why are 
student fees being spent on something 
as useless as foam fingers anyway? We 
should recognize how telling this event 
is of the council’s spending practices. 

Where was the council oversight? 
And even more importantly, why 

does the council continue to fund 
Triton Tide in the first place? Students 
are now handing athletics $3.6 mil-
lion a year, no strings attached, which 

the department has spent on who  
knows what. The least it could do is 
pump a few grand into publicizing its 
own events. 

But try to suggest that at a council 
meeting, and feel the irrational wrath 
of zealots Payne and All-Campus 
Senator Meghan Clair, an unwaver-
ing Triton Tide ally. Apparently, for 
the 2007-08 council, it isn’t about 
supporting the decisions that make 
the most sense; it’s about who can 
yell the loudest and what it takes to 
shut them up.

Instead of an 
efficient, logical 
or even priority-
based distribu-
tion of funds, the 
council, under 
constant pres-
sure from Triton 
Tide support-
ers, is throwing 
thousands of 
dollars around 
like candy. And 
students are 
suckered into 

paying more and more, just to see 
their activity fees wasted.

It’s good for Payne: In being com-
pletely insufferable, his incompe-
tence was ignored and his beloved 
Triton Tide was allowed to literally 
throw away $2,000 of student fees. 
Meanwhile, many organizations and 
student services, which actually affect 
a far greater number of students than 
the few that attend athletic games, 
remain underfunded.

Maybe these starving organiza-
tions should learn something from 
Payne: All it takes for their slice of the 
carryover pie is to harass chunks of it 
out of the council.

When asked about Triton Tide 
and the recent funding allotment, 
Payne declined to comment.

difficult to see a world outside the 
cozy confines of Geisel library, Price 
Center eateries, themed house par-
ties and our happy moments solving 
the Guardian’s sudoku puzzles dur-
ing class instead of paying attention 
to our oftentimes-bland lectures on 
thermodynamics or electromagne-
tism. We get so embroiled in the 
unending flurry of papers, mid-
terms, lunch dates and reality tele-
vision shows, that it’s often hard for 
us to look beyond our day-to-day 
college experiences and explore the 
world in its entirety. 

For these reasons, it comes as a 
surprise to many of us that there is 
a realm outside of our demanding 
college lives and, yes, even outside 
of the United States, just waiting to 
be explored. We may read about it 
in the newspapers, or catch glimpses 
of it on the evening news (though 
many of us would rather watch the 
latest episode of the Office instead), 
but experiencing it for ourselves 
firsthand is something completely 
different, and also completely nec-
essary, if we would like to label 
ourselves as informed and cultured 
individuals. 

When I finally left San Diego’s 
confines to study abroad in Siena, 
Italy, I was thrilled to learn what 
the lands beyond California 
had to offer. My journey from  
Rome up through the rolling hills 
of Tuscany was a learning experi-
ence in itself. I knew only a few key 
phrases in Italian, and finding my 
way to the train station and ask-
ing for directions was a lot harder 
than I initially thought it would 
be. Carrying close to 80 pounds of 
luggage while struggling to trans-
late directions and understand train 
schedules was stressful. To make 
matters worse, no one had informed 
me that single-file lines and com-
mon courtesy were not all the rage 

in Italy, and that no one will ever 
feel sorry for you if you fall down an 
escalator in a busy train station. 

For the first time in a long while, 
I honestly felt incredibly humbled. I 
knew that I shouldn’t have expected 
to immediately plunge into a com-
pletely different world to be easy — 
but even with my attempts at mental 
preparation and my trusty Italian 
phrasebook in hand, coming out of 
my little college utopia to immerse 
myself in the Italian culture was a 
much-needed reality check. 

As I stepped outside Fiumicino 

airport into the humid Roman air, 
I had a number of harsh realiza-
tions: No one around me under-
stood English, or my sad attempts 
at Italian. Not everyone in Europe 
was in love with my profoundly 
American accent or impressed with 
my Jansport backpack and Chuck 
Taylors. As a matter of fact, many 
Italians were just as irritated (if not 
more so) by my cultural ignorance 
as Americans are with foreigners 
who speak poor English and mock 
our love for ice cubes and big cars.

In a way, it was refreshing to 
be seen as an ignorant foreigner. I 
had become so accustomed to being 
in control of everything back at 
UCSD, and priding myself on my 
academic achievements, Guardian 

articles and my dear posse of friends 
— but none of those things mattered 
in Italy. What did matter were my 
abilities to adapt to Italian culture 
and my efforts to integrate myself 
into the country’s rich customs and 
traditions. This process was quite 
a challenge for me, but in the end, 
my efforts paid off and I was gener-
ously rewarded with a deeper look 
into the society, politics and the 
way of life in this beautiful coun-
try. If I hadn’t been able to put my 
slightly stubborn, slightly haughty, 
American-college-student ways 
aside, I’m certain that my expe-
rience in Europe would not have 
had such a profound affect on my 
life and I probably wouldn’t have 
learned so much about myself and 
the world around me. 

Experiencing life in Europe 
and seeing the United States and 
American college students from an 
outsider’s perspective was an eye 
opener that  can never be experi-
enced within the protective shield 
of university life. It gave me a genu-
ine idea of culture, world issues 
and lifestyle, and really changed my 
perspective on the world, which I 
thought I had already known so 
well. 

So I challenge the rest of you 
know-it-all college kids to break out of 
your safe havens and try seeing your-
selves from someone else’s perspective 
instead of from your own glorified 
points of view. If this means studying 
abroad, traveling or simply seizing 
opportunities to try things that you 
normally wouldn’t do, so be it. 

One thing is for sure, if we stop 
kidding ourselves and putting on 
our pretentious-college-student 
shows, we can experience situations 
that will help us learn much more 
about ourselves and our world than 
any novel, news program or psy-
chology class could ever hope to 
teach us.

Most students don’t notice, but someone’s eyes fol-
low them around campus. Whether it’s on their way out 
of the Cognitive Science building, during their evening 
jog through John Muir College Commons or on a stroll 
through Mandeville’s concrete hallways, they’re being 
watched. 

Not through the lens of a hidden video camera or the 
peepers of a curious wanderer, but by a simple stenciled 
eye, discreetly tattooed onto the concrete as a signature 
image of a graffiti artist.

“[Stencil art] makes things prettier,” said one sopho-
more stencil-graffiti artist who wished to remain anony-
mous. “An interesting stencil can add something. It’s 
always repeated and it’s always the same thing, so it’s sort 
of like a stamp or pop art. It’s just a question of decorat-
ing the campus in a certain way, and that’s how a lot of 
people choose to do it.”

Many students contribute to alternative, on-cam-
pus art in the form of stenciling, a type of graffiti that 
is quicker and tidier than the traditional art form. 
Spearheaded by a British graffiti artist named Banksy,

minorities through outreach programs that 
encourage black, Latino and Native American 
students to apply to the university, and if accept-
ed, choose to enroll as a student — a roundabout 
technique that avoids considering race as a con-
crete admissions factor within the actual admis-
sions process.

The legislation makes it illegal to consider 
race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin in 
decisions such as college admissions, business 
contracts and public-sector jobs. 

This issue first helicoptered into the UC sys-
tem in 1995, when the UC Board of Regents 
passed a resolution prohibiting admissions com-
mittees from employing affirmative action. That 
same year a conservative movement, spearhead-
ed by then-UC Regent Ward Connerly, placed 
Proposition 209 on the ballot, which passed by 
54 percent.

In the past decade UCSD’s undergraduate 
population has grown by 46 percent. At the same 
time, there are fewer black and Native American 
students than before the legislation passed. And 
while the number of Latino student has nearly 
doubled, it still constitutes the same percentage as 

when Proposition 209 arrived.
Many on campus programs that have 

developed skirt the proposition’s language, 
promoting diversity without falling under 
the categorization of affirmative action. 
These “diversity activities” are programs 
and organized outreach plans that spe-
cifically target historically underrepresent-
ed minorities. Statistics show that among 
minority students admitted to UCSD, the num-
ber of those that accept their admissions offer is 
relatively low, which in turn contributes to the low 
numbers of such students on campus. For these 
various diversity-minded groups, one key focus 
is the increase of “yield” statistics — which is to 
increase the number of already-admitted minor-
ity students who choose to enroll at UCSD. 

Associate Chancellor and Chief Diversity 
Officer Jorge Huerta chaired a university-com-
missioned committee that explored ways to 
increase “yield,” and released report in March 
2007. The report detailed some of the diversity 
activities already in place and proposed others to 
increase yield figures. 

The African American Studies minor and the 

Chicano and Latino Arts and Humanities minor 
are two such programs. But these are only some 
of the many creative solutions that operate within 
Proposition 209’s restrictions while contributing 
to the growth of on-campus diversity.

Such yield-boosting diversity activities are 
helping to increase diversity in the context of state 
laws that prohibit affirmative action. 

“It’s about getting out there and doing what’s 
legal, [and] reaching out to the students who 
wouldn’t otherwise have this opportunity,” Huerta 
said.

His office is working on a myriad of programs 
to increase outreach and awareness, in an attempt 
to expand racial diversity at UCSD. 

“The numbers are really striking when you 
look at the various groups,” Huerta said of UCSD’s 
admissions rates. “It’s not a reflection of the popu-
lation.”

Meanwhile, supporters of Proposition 209 
argue against affirmative action, as a way to 
increase diversity in higher education. Connerly, 
for instance, has remained an ever-vocal critic of 
affirmative action, and many believe his efforts to 
be largely responsible for the advent of Proposition 
209. Since his term as regent, Connerly has 
helped to bring about similar measures in public

At the hot spring of El Haize, a small valley in the Western Sahara, Osam Ahmed rested 
against a white brick wall under the 
thatched stick roof of a makeshift hut. 
His black and white kaffiya, the tradi-
tional headdress of the Bedouin,  faded 
gray shirt and dirty blue jeans reveal — 
along with an emerging beard and sand-
streaked face — that he hasn’t bathed or 
changed clothes for days.

“If you see me with a shower, shaved, 
with nice clothes, you would say, ‘Who is 
that man?’” he laughed, responding to a 
guess that he is 30 years old. Born in 1985 
in the oasis town of Bahariya, Ahmed has 
spent his entire life in the desert. For the 
past five years, he has led tour groups 
through the Sahara, including our group 
of American study-abroad students on 
the weekend of Oct. 6. 

Some spots still impress Ahmed. 
“Welcome to the second planet,” he said.

 At the White Desert’s opening, where 

Jeeps parked between two cliffs atop a 
sprawling dune. The group then climbed 
a hill to get the full panoramic view.

The sand pouring into the valley 

crashes into immense stone monuments, 
shaped by years of heavy wind. 

While some in the group descend-
ed, others climbed up the side cliffs 
and gazed upon the smooth skyscrap-
ers of rock jutting out of the earth 
below. Tracks in the sand marked where 
Jeeps had passed between the towers 
and headed off into the vast expanse of 
horizon.

Ahmed has been all over Egypt — to 
the Black and White Deserts, to the 
Great Sand Sea in far western Egypt and 
to the Gilf el Kabir in the southwest. He 
leads groups north to the Siwa and Gara 
Oases, to the Qattara Depression in the 
central north and to Fayoum and Giza 
just outside Cairo. He travels to Frafra 
and Dakhla Oases in central Egypt and 
to the southeast Kharga Oasis just west 
of Luxor. 

“In November I am going for 22 days 
from the White Desert,” he said. “We will 
go by camel. This is a fun trip. It is a good 
time to be going.”

Ahmed never worries about spending 
long spells in the desert or about getting 
lost in the endless sands.

“It only happened once,” he said. “A 
group of three Japanese; they drank all 
night and in the morning [the guide] 
was not clear, he headed off the wrong

For students who enjoy meals comprised of mass-pro-duced ground beef or greasy Chinese food, Price Center 
offers a smorgasbord of quick and 
tasty options that may not provide 
nourishment but definitely leave 
students feeling full. But where can 
those students find something more 
nutritious, healthy and even fresh? 
Fortunately, UCSD has an expand-
ing amount of options for students 
searching for organic foods; it just 
takes a little invested interest to find 
them.

Students who shop at 
Groundwork Books or find them-
selves lost between John Muir and 
Revelle Colleges might have found 
the student-run Food Co-op in 
Student Center, which provides 
vegan and vegetarian snacks, along 
with fresh produce and an organic 
salad bar. Though it is tucked away 
in a part of campus that is home to 
more construction than students, the 
co-op promotes making educated 
choices about food, not only for per-
sonal health, but also for the world. 

 “The main thing [about organ-
ics] is connecting yourself with the 
communities that provide you food, 
not having it appear in a Styrofoam 
box,” Muir College senior and Co-op 
member Adam Calo said. “People 
don’t understand how their indi-
vidual choice is important.”

By cutting out the use of pesti-
cides, distributing locally and using 
manual labor in place of machinery, 
organic growers greatly decrease the 
environmental impact of their food 
production. Choices as simple as 
picking up an organic apple or salad 
influence the way farmlands and 
farm workers are treated; the effect 
goes beyond a singular choice.

“I can use my ability as a consum-
er to choose products, choose prac-
tices I support morally and ethically, 
and not have food be separate,” Calo 
said. “The world is so dependent on 
agriculture and how it’s done, so to 
separate your meals from what it’s 
actually doing in the world is a big 
error.”

If Student Center is too remote 
for students only familiar with the 
campus’ main paths, organic options 
can also be found in Price Center’s 
Sunshine Store. Bonnie Harmon, the 
store’s manager and developer, sur-
veyed eco-friendly chains such as 
Whole Foods and Sprouts this sum-
mer, and has contacted other major 
organic vendors to give the campus 
convenience store a healthier variety 
of foods in preparation for the Price 
Center expansion project.

“The [UCSD] community has 
a responsibility to the students on 
campus to provide them with an 
environment where they are able 
to make choices that are healthy 

for themselves,” Harmon said. “… 
I feel responsible for making sure 
[healthy] options are there.”

Though the current selection 
of organic products is limited, the 
Sunshine Store will be expanding 
in February 2008 to become the 
Sunshine Market, which will not 
only include not only an organic 
section, but an international section 
also. Though the store is growing 
and will be providing more options, 
Harmon wants to remain appealing 
to budget-minded students.

“One thing I want the students 
to know they can count on at the 
Sunshine Store is good value,” 
Harmon said. 

Harmon also spearheads the 
farmer’s market, another convenient 
organic option located on Library 

Walk and Lyman Lane near the 
Chancellor’s Complex, every Tuesday 
from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.

 “I have seen a revolution brew-
ing … students are very knowledge-
able about what they want to eat, 
what they want to put into their bod-
ies and what they expect that food to 
provide for their bodies,” Harmon 
said. “That’s why we brought the 
farmer’s market on campus.” 

The market is currently in its 
fourth season of operation and has 
a wide variety of healthy, fresh and 
organic foods. Vendors representing 
certified organic growers such as 
Budwood Farms and Smit Orchards 
frequent the campus market and 
also participate in other markets 
throughout San Diego County.

“[UCSD] is a great place to be 
selling organic food because fruit 
isn’t something that needs to be pre-
pared,” Smit Orchards vendor and 
UCSD alumnus Matthew Smit said. 
“You can eat it right away or put it in 
your fridge … so [for] students, it’s a 
fantastic thing.” 

Like most certified organic ven-
dors, the price of Smit produce tends 
to be more expensive than their non-
organic counterparts. However, the 
increase in price not only accounts 
for the food quality, but also envi-
ronmental benefits and labor con-
sciousness.

“[Organic farmers] are growing 
the products and taking the extra 
steps to make a really healthy and 
tasty product; we’re not trying to just 
make as much as possible, grow as 
much as possible and sell as much 
as possible,” Smit said. “So, because 
of that, organic farmers tend to be 
a little more conscious about [their 
workers.] … [Organic food] is com-
ing straight from the farm to the 
customer.”

Along with Smit, returning ven-
dor Larry Nedeu of Budwood Farms 
can be found among the vegetable 
and fruit-laden tables at the farm-
er’s market, selling organic produce 
to UCSD students. Both Smit and 

Responding to the growing concern for sustainability, 
on-campus eateries look to provide healthier options.

Price Center Goes Under Fire as 
Mobbers Imitate a Popular Commerical

On Oct. 19, Sixth College sophomore Juan Vasquez and Thurgood Marshall 
College sophomore Yuki Murakami (pictured left) aimed their index fingers at 
one another, their thumbs pointed toward the sky, ready to fire — hundreds 
followed their lead. Then, Vasquez yelled, “Bang!” and TritonMob madness 
ensued. Participants on all ends of Price Center aimed mock pistols at other 
shooters, while imitating gun shots and grenade explosions. “Injured” mobbers 
began to fall, and within 60 seconds, the event was over.

Inspired by a banned X-Box commerical, the flash mob was the first from 
the unofficial TritonMob group, a Facebook.com phenomenon that has united 
students for the simple purpose of holding huge, random gatherings, such as 
pillow fights or red-light-green-light games, around campus.

Nedeu are certified organic vendors 
and have dealt with copious amounts 
of paperwork and high expenses to 
continue sustainable farming. Nedeu 
has been farming organically for 12 
years, working manually without the 
assistance of tractors or any heavy 
machinery. Weeding proves to be 
especially tough for organic farm-
ers that either deal with the problem 
themselves or have to hire assistants. 
However, the extra work goes a long 
way on a grander scale: The food is 
more nutritious and the land isn’t 
left ravaged by pesticides or heavy 
machinery.

 “It’s all about improving the land, 
not just taking from it like conven-
tional farming,” Nedeu said.

These environmentally friendly 
techniques are evident in the food’s 
appearance. 

“We have some really great-look-
ing produce and that just comes from 
putting in the effort to do it right,” 
Smit said.

For students dedicated to the stan-
dard meal-point system, Housing 
and Dining Services has also intro-
duced organic food to its cuisine. 
With dining halls such as Foodworx, 
Sierra Summit and Cafe Ventanas 
offering organic teas, coffees, yogurts 
and soups, students can also make 
healthier choices while still being able 
to rely on the money allotted to their 
meal-point plans. 

Steve Casad, the director of Dining, 
Retail and Conference Services, has 
made a conscious effort to provide 
organic options, especially for stu-
dents who live in apartments.

“There is an increasing organic 
line at Earl’s Place,” Casad said. “We 
want to make sure there is an array 
of organic choices for students to take 
back to their rooms to prepare.”

At on-campus dining halls, organ-
ic foods have become ingredients in 
many of the entrees that dining halls 
produce, due to the recent addition of 
a culinary director and dietitian to the 
staff. The culinary director and dieti-
tian work together to formulate reci-
pes that appear in all of the campus 
dining halls, and focus on attaining a 
uniform standard of high quality taste 
and nutrition.

“It is our responsibility to take care 
of the students and offer healthy and 
nutritious meals,” Casad said. 

While the staff at Housing and 
Dining Services and other on-cam-
pus eateries is looking to expand the 
selection of organic food, at the end 
of the day, the choices and students’ 
desires will determine whether organ-
ic options are expanded.

 “[What we serve] is based on 
the masses,” Casad said. “The organ-
ic, health conscious, environmen-
tally and labor friendly options are 
out there, and have the potential to 
expand — the choice is up to you.”

way. We know this man is supposed 
to be back, so  when he doesn’t show 
everyone gets their Jeeps and goes 
out. We found one man, he was far 
from the others and he led us to 
them. It happens, but never to me.”

Outside the hut in El Haize, 
several trucks pulled into a dirt 
lot. They were newer than those of 
Ahmed Safari Camp, the tour and 
hotel management group run by 
the Ahmed family, and no gear was 
strapped to the roofs. The Ahmed 
family’s three Jeeps hauled stacks of 
sleeping mats, sleeping bags, orien-
tal rugs, low-lying tables and fire-
wood — all the luxuries of a desert 
camp.

The other tour group, made of 
two families, climbed out of their 
air-conditioned trucks and gathered 
around the hot-spring pool while 
Ahmed, his three fellow guides and 
14 student tourists rested in the hut’s 
shade. The 3-foot deep, 8-by-12 con-

crete pool is filled by the pressure 
of the spring fed through a large 
black pipe, spilling its water into an 
aqueduct and through the middle 
of the hut, finally 
draining into the 
gardens behind. 

An hour ear-
lier, Ahmed had 
swum in the pool. 
The desert guides 
dunked their 
tourists under 
the water and 
splashed around 
beneath the des-
ert sun. The silky, 
light blue water 
filled up with dis-
turbed slick sludge from the pool 
walls. 

Children from the quiet, rustic 
village nearby gathered to swim, play 
and fill water bottles in the spring 
as the second tour group departed. 
When approached, they smiled and 

put up their thumbs. They asked for 
money and then, giving up the pur-
suit of cash, asked for pens.

Ahmed grew up in the desert, liv-
ing a life similar 
to the children 
at the pool. He 
now leads safaris 
among the soft 
bleached rocks 
of the White 
Desert, the jag-
ged mushroom-
shaped stones 
and waves of 
clay resembling 
w i n d - b l o w n 
sand. He finds 
home’s comforts 

in the echoing silence of the desert 
night. The environment practically 
raised Ahmed; he never received an 
education beyond what the desert 
has provided him.

Resting under their shelter 
of reeds and thatched sticks, the 

American students consulted guide-
books and discussed future weekend 
travels to Turkey, Jordan and Greece. 
Chatting about Egypt, the previous 
night spent in the Sahara dunes and 
the luxuries of home, we rested and 
waited for our meal.

Alongside the trickling water of 
the shelter’s aqueduct, we dined on 
warm pita bread, platters of grapes 
and a freshly made tuna salad 
chopped with tomatoes and onions. 
After the meal and another round 
of lounging, Ahmed called out to 
the group, “Yalla” or “let’s go” in 
Egyptian Arabic.

The Jeeps pulled out from the hot 
spring and drove past the kids of El 
Haize, who waved from the side of 
the road, saying goodbye to another 
group of tourists on their way to a 
camp in the midst of the “second 
planet.”

Connerly contends that using affir-
mative action in college admissions 
hurts students of underrepresented 
ethnicities. He believes that affirma-
tive action sends a negative message to 
high-achieving minority students that 
they need an extra boost in order to be 
admitted to college.

According to Huerta, historically 
underrepresented minority students  
are even disadvantaged long before 
the admissions process, as they often 
compete against students from more 

affluent high schools that usually spon-
sor more advanced placement, hon-
ors and college-preparatory classes. 
This contributes to recent downward 
admissions and enrollment trends for 
underrepresented minority students at 
UCSD.

“They don’t have the same privi-
leges, they don’t have the same oppor-
tunities,” Huerta said. 

However, Huerta remains hopeful 
that his office can sponsor programs to 
increase UCSD’s overall diversity.

“We’re looking for excellence and 
equity,” he said.

stencil graffiti has become increas-
ingly popular in the last decade 
due to its low risk and appealing 
aesthetics. 

The basic process of a stencil 
starts when the artist chooses an 
image and creates a dual-tonal pat-
tern with a computer program such 
as Photoshop. The artist massages 
the photo until it’s fit to print, then 
laminates and razors it. Artists can 
also create more complex multi-
layered stencils, which allow for 
numerous colors within one piece. 
The final product is an idiosyncratic 
graphic that can take only a few sec-
onds to spray on a wall, a definite 
plus for those wary of the law.

“If you’re fast you can do it in 
10 seconds,” the artist said. “That’s 
the appeal of it, that’s why it became 
popular in the first place, because 
the difference between putting up a 
huge piece in half a minute and put-
ting up a huge piece in 10 minutes 
is, you know, you’re arrested.”

UCSD’s official art pieces con-
sist of Stuart Collection pieces like 
the “Two Running Violet V Forms” 
(better known as the giraffe catch-
ers), but graffiti artists view creative 
student areas such as the Mandeville 
graffiti stairway and the Che Cafe as 
underappreciated and divided from 
the rest of the campus.

“UCSD has a really great visual 
arts department, and it’s really sup-
ported,” the artist said. “Maybe if 
it were to be more integrated with 
the rest of the campus, rather than 
just held in Mandeville, that would 
be better. Right now it’s crammed 
down in the bottom of a stairway 
and it’s sort of isolated.”

In addition to confining the 
location for artistic student expres-
sion, campus officials have recently 
started painting over graffiti outside 

of Mandeville Hall, placing discour-
aging signs nearby the area and reg-
ulating students like Muir College 
senior and stencil artist Ji-San Lee.

“Being able to paint freely and 
not have to worry about doing 
something illegal is great,” Lee said. 
“But recently I tried painting [at 
Mandeville Hall], and some guy told 
me I couldn’t.”

According to Lee, the universi-
ty’s unwelcoming attitude is due to 
a general misunderstanding of the 
art form.

“I skate and stencil and there are 
a lot of faculty members that see 
painting on the wall or skating and 
they’re frustrated,” Lee said. “But a 
college campus shouldn’t be such a 
rigid environment. With stencils, 
it’s not like we’re having gang wars. 
I think it gives the campus more 
culture and more diversity, besides 
having concrete everywhere.”

Just as stenciling contributes to a 
campus’ look, it also builds a more 
cohesive population at UCSD.

“It creates a community, like 
the Mandeville wall is itself a com-
munity,” the anonymous artist said. 
“Not that everyone who does graffiti 
knows each other that well, but it’s 
more like the art itself. Eventually 
it’s transient, it’s going to be gone 
the next day, so if you can put 
something up that’s really good that 
people really like, they won’t take it 
down and maybe you’ll see it in their 
styles later which, in a way, makes it 
so your art is still existing.” 

Whether or not the university 
actively supports the stenciling stu-
dent movement, artists on campus 
can’t help but pencil themselves into 
the campus agenda.

“Seeing your work around cam-
pus is like being in a museum and 
looking at your painting,” Lee said. 
“It’s a hard feeling to beat.”

their thrashing of Cal State Stanislaus. 
The Warriors would take the first 
advantage in game one as UCSD got 
off to a slow start. Down by one, the 
Tritons went on a six-point run to 
take a 25-19 lead and eventually took 
the game.

Fired up after squeaking out game 
one, the Tritons blazed to a 6-1 lead 
early and then stretched the margin to 
nine at 20-11. The Warriors didn’t have 
an answer for the robust Triton offense 
on the night, as UCSD was relentless 
and put down 14 kills in the game to 
take the win.

Down early in game three, senior 
opposite Amber Ries powered the 
Tritons to a 12-7 lead on a monster 
smash over a Warrior block. UCSD 
stretched the lead to nine on a pair of 
kills by junior outside hitter Kimberley 
Carpenter. Cal State Stanislaus made 
things interesting in the later stages, 
closing the gap to 26-23. But the team 
couldn’t pull off the comeback and 
the Tritons finished off the Warriors 
30-25.

Despite the victory, Black was frus-
trated with the team’s slow start.

“I think we came out a little slug-
gish,” Black said. “We know we can’t do 
that and really need to improve there.”

Oct. 20 was a different tale. Unlike 
Cal State Stanislaus, who hasn’t beaten 
UCSD since 2002, the Wildcats from 
Chico downed the Tritons in the open-

ing weeks of conference play. With 
revenge in mind, UCSD played con-
sistent and tough volleyball in a well-
contested match.

The Tritons cruised in game one 
by opening a 17-11 lead in front of 979 
rowdy fans. They wouldn’t be tested 
the rest of the game, taking the win on 
an explosive Bailey kill.

In game two, Chico State rebound-
ed, speeding out to a 16-9 advantage. 
The Tritons regained form after the 
disappointing start, slowly closing the 
gap. UCSD took advantage of each 
service opportunity while down, going 
on several small runs that helped tie up 
the match at 23-23.

Black said he enjoyed seeing his 
squad dig itself out of a hole and catch 
up to the Wildcats.

“The comeback was really fun to 
watch,” Black said. “We called the time-
out and knew all we had to do was get 
on some service runs and that’s exactly 
what we did. It was really impressive.”

The Wildcats showed the maturity 
of a battle-tested team, edging out a 
29-28 lead. However, Bailey denied 
Chico State’s game point with a kill, 
and sophomore middle blocker Sylvia 
Schmidt added an ace to take a 30-
29 advantage. Junior middle blocker 
Hannah Gary then threw down the 
final point for UCSD. 

According to Bailey, Gary’s joust to 
finish game two capped a spectacular 
team effort that was heightened by the 

swarming Triton Tide.
“We’ve really been focusing on the 

task at hand and playing for the next 
point,” Bailey said. “We just chipped 
away and chipped away and did it well 
last night. But we couldn’t have done it 
without that crowd. They really gave 
us energy.”

Junior defensive specialist Michelle 
Torres picked apart the Wildcats from 
the service line in game three, and her 
presence at the game was a pleasant 
surprise according to Black.

“Michelle had some bad milk ear-
lier and was sick,” he said. “She drove 
in a half hour before the game and 
warmed up and played spectacular. It 
was a really gutsy performance.”  

Up 15-10 after a Schmidt kill, 
Torres continued to put pressure on 
Chico State with aggressive serving, 
extending the lead to 18-10.   

The Wildcats continued to play 
tough, but it just wasn’t enough on a 
night where UCSD totaled 46 kills and 
nine aces as a team.

“It was probably one of the best 
nights of my career,” Bailey said. “We 
came together and played together and 
were extremely loud on the sidelines. 
Everyone wanted it and the big win is a 
booster heading into next week.” 

The Tritons hope to extend their 
five-game winning streak against Cal 
Poly Pomona and No. 2 Cal State San 
Bernardino on Oct. 26 and Oct. 27, 
respectively.

opportunity. 
The Tritons scored on their own 

6-on-5 opportunity during the ensu-
ing possession with sophomore two-
meter Daniel Garcia scoring from the 
deep wing to cut the UC Davis lead 
to 3-2. With one minute left in the 
half, the Aggies added another goal 
to grab a 4-2 lead at halftime.

The Tritons came out strong in 
the second half, scoring on another 
counterattack goal from Vermilyea 
in the first minute. UCSD continued 
its strong defense and was able to 
keep UC Davis scoreless in the quar-
ter by forcing several turnovers. With 
two minutes left in the third quarter, 
senior driver Curtis Williamson tied 
the game with a goal from the flat to 
even the score at 4-4.

Sophomore utility Peter Gresham 
said that the Tritons’ consistent 
effort throughout the game allowed 
them to pull close to the Aggies.

“We had a lot of intensity and we 
kept it going throughout the entire 
game,” Gresham said. “We played 
together as a team.”

The teams continued their tight 
back-and-forth play throughout the 
fourth quarter. Garcia, sophomore 
two-meter defender Steven Donohoe 
and senior driver Benjamin Miller 
added goals for the Tritons to make 
the score 7-6 with less than two 
minutes left in the quarter. With 
1:41 left in regulation, UC Davis 
senior utility Nick Arrigo scored 
the tying goal to send the game into 
overtime. 

Defense was, once again, the 
main focus in the first three-minute 
overtime period. The Tritons and 
Aggies had one 6-on-5 opportu-

nity apiece, but both were unable 
to score. With 14 seconds left in the 
period, UC Davis scored a goal from 
the deep wing to take an 8-7 lead. 

The Aggies scored another quick 
goal in the second overtime peri-
od for a two-goal lead. Williamson 
responded by scoring with 54 sec-
onds left in the period to close with-
in one of the Aggies. UCSD got the 
ball back with 36 seconds remain-
ing, but was unable to convert.

Despite the loss, the game was 
the Tritons’ best showing against 
UC Davis this season. UCSD faced 
UC Davis twice early in its 2007 
season, resulting in losses for the 
Tritons with scores of 11-7 and 13-7 
in regulation.

Harper said that his squad is 
improving and has met his expecta-
tions.

“This season has gone just the 
way I predicted,” Harper said. “We’ll 
get better and I don’t think Davis 
will … UC Davis has been the front-
runner in our conference and we 
nearly knocked them off.” 

The Tritons will travel to UC 
Irvine to face the No. 9 Anteaters 
on Oct. 26, and will face No. 7 
Loyola Marymount University on 
Oct. 27. Since UC Irvine is not in 
the Western Water Polo Association, 
UCSD plans to use the game against 
the Anteaters to get ready for the 
WWPA championships coming up 
on Nov. 16 through 18. The Tritons 
are looking to defend the WWPA 
title that they won last year over 
Loyola Marymount University.

“We’re right there with five or 
six teams that could win the confer-
ence title,” Harper said. “I like where 
we’re at right now.”

5-foot-10-inches [tall] or 5-foot-11-
inches and I’m 5-foot-3-inches, so we 
couldn’t get to those balls.”

Despite two recent losses, the 
Tritons are not pressing and taking 
their season one game at a time.

“We’re not starting to crack and 
we’re not losing our composure,” 
Pepper said. “Sometimes you just 
have those losses. You have those 
games where you knew you could 
win, it’s just putting it together from 
the back all the way to the front. 
We’re a really strong team mentally 
so it’s just going to come down to 
us coming together and showing we 
can win.”

The Tritons realize that they can-
not continue their style of play if 
they hope to play deep into the 
postseason.

“I think it’s getting harder to 
get away with playing this poorly,” 
Campbell said. “We can’t play like 
this in the postseason. We’re good 
at making the [California Collegiate 
Athletic Association] league cham-
pionships but there is no way get 
away with this in the NCAAs. We’ll 
regroup and play like we know 
how.”

Sunday’s win will hopefully get 
the Tritons back on track for their 
last two regular season games so 
they can head into the postseason 
with some momentum. On Oct. 26, 
UCSD will take on Cal State San 
Bernardino at home.

 The UCSD men’s soccer team 
started its season with an abys-
mal record of 2-9-2, but has since 
doubled that win total in its past 
three games. The Tritons posted 
their first consecutive wins of the 
season by shutting out Cal State 
Los Angeles 1-0 on Oct. 12 and 
outlasting Chico State in overtime 
by a score of 2-1 on Oct. 19. The 
team continued its win streak on 
Oct. 21 by playing to a draw against 
another conference opponent in Cal 
State Stanislaus, keeping its playoff 
chances alive. The tie improved the 
team’s overall record to 4-9-3 and 3-
6-3 in California Collegiate Athletic 
Association play. 

Interim head coach Paul Holohan 
had nothing but praise for his resur-
gent team. 

“The team is doing very well at 
the moment,” he said. “[The play-
ers’] effort and commitment to what 
they’re doing is tremendous. The 
players are all playing for me … and 
as a coach, I can’t ask for any more.”

The Tritons got their fourth win 
of the season when they defeated 
Chico State in a double overtime 
thriller. Having been held in check 
for the entire game and down 0-1 
with about two minutes left, junior 
forward Jason Le scored the equaliz-
er in the 88th minute from an assist 
by senior midfielder Joe Shah. 

Shah said that with only minutes 
to play, he was looking to create any 
opportunity for the Tritons.

“I saw my options and something 
opened up on the side,” he said. 
“[Le] was running on the side and I 
yelled at him to shoot. It was great.” 

After nearly two scoreless over-
time periods both teams seemed 
resigned to a 1-1 draw. However, 
the Tritons ramped up their attack 
with less than two minutes to play 
and their pressure earned them a 
corner kick. Le took corner and sent 
a ball into the penalty box, where 
both Tritons and Wildcats swarmed 
around the ball to fight for posses-
sion. Somewhere in the scramble, 
sophomore midfielder Tony Choi 
managed to knock the ball in for the 
game winner. The goal was inter-

estingly reminiscent of last year’s 
match against Chico State in which 
Choi also scored the goal with only 
minutes to spare in double over-
time.

The team carried the momentum 
from the win into its match against 
Cal State Stanislaus in its second 
game of the weekend and was able 
to play to a 1-1 tie. Choi once again 
was able to bring the Tritons back 
from a one-point deficit in the 59th 
minute after freshman defender 
Brandon Yee found Choi with a 
perfect lead pass.

Despite playing a solid 110 min-
utes, the Tritons bemoaned many 
lost opportunities throughout the 
game.

“We should have won [earlier],” 
senior defender Josh Levy said. “We 
had so many chances it was ridicu-
lous.”

While it was good to get the tie 
and keep the team’s playoff hopes 
alive, the Tritons lost Le for the 
rest of the season after he collided 
with a Stanislaus player and broke 
his leg in two places, resulting in a 
compound fracture. Choi was upset 
about Le’s gruesome injury but was 
ready to take on the extra offensive 
pressure. 

“I was right there when it hap-
pened to him,” he said. “I was pretty 
shocked. During the 30 minutes I 
was sitting on the bench and think-
ing I have to pick it up now. I guess 
I’m just going to have to play extra 
hard and fill in a little bit for [Le].”

Holohan expressed sadness for 
Le’s injury but emphasized that the 
season must go on. 

“Losing Jason Le is a big blow,” 
he said. “He’s a very good player 
and any team would miss him, but 
unfortunately these things happen 
in sports and we just have to move 
on. He’s a part of this team. It’s an 
unfortunate thing to happen but 
we’ll look after Jason. We’ll just hope 
we have him back for next year.”

Despite the loss of Le, the fact 
that the offense seems to be revital-
ized cannot be overlooked. Choi 
explained that a large part of the 
team’s recent offensive production 
has been the increasing level of 
comfort that the players have with 
each other.

“I think it’s just because we have 
a new group of guys and we finally 
know how all of us play,” he said. 
“We’re just clicking and team chem-
istry is getting better.”

Levy did not give a reason for 
the offensive surge but said he was 
delighted to see the team perform 
better.

“We’ve done a lot better as it 
shows,” Levy said. “We’re scoring 
goals and having tons of opportuni-
ties. It’s another day and another 
fight.”

Despite the successful weekend, 
the Tritons still only have an outside 
shot to make the playoffs. Shah said 
that the team knew its situation and 
that the squad had to be perfect to 
have any chance of extending its 
season to November. 

“We knew what we had to do,” 
Shah said. “We knew straight up 
that we had to win. Everyone is 
picking everyone else up. Any loose 
balls, we know as a team that we all 
have to go for it not as an individual. 
We don’t care who it is we just know 
that we have to be there. The team 
is getting together and making a 
big final push for the end of the 
season.”

Since taking over the team 
after the sudden retirement of for-
mer head coach Derek Armstrong, 
Holohan has done a spectacular job 
keeping the team focused and still 
in playoff contention. His record is 
now 3-3-2; though just a .500 mark, 
his team’s play of late has been very 
impressive compared to the team’s 
performance before he took over. 

Choi has appreciated the job 
Holohan has done since taking 
over. 

“[Holohann] has done a great 
job with us,” he said. “He gets us 
motivated and gets us pumped up 
in the game. He’s been very good 
getting the team organized and it’s 
been coming together.”

Holohan expressed hope that he 
would be able to stay on as the 
team’s head coach, speaking glow-
ingly of the team and the players. 

“I want to do the job.” Holohan 
said. “I love coaching the boys. 
We’ve got a young team and I’d 
like to continue and hopefully grow 
together as a team.”

HOT CORNER

MONDAY, OCTOBER 22, 2007

By Janani Sridharan
Staff Writer

The UCSD men’s water polo sea-
son has been filled with close losses 
at home, and the game against No. 
10 UC Davis on Oct. 19 was no 
exception. The No. 14 Tritons fought 
hard against the Aggies but came up 
just short, falling 9-8 in overtime. 
The loss gives the team a 10-12 sea-
son record. And with high-ranked 
opponents looming in their upcom-
ing contests, bringing their record to 
an even .500 will be a challenge for 
the Tritons. 

The first quarter of the game 
against UC Davis was more of a 
swim meet than a water polo game, 

with numerous turnovers and neither 
team having much success putting 
the ball in the goal. UC Davis scored 
first on a goal from its two meter, 
but junior driver Chance Vermilyea 
answered back for UCSD with a lob 
goal off of the Tritons’ counterattack, 
evening the score at 1-1. 

Defense took over the game early, 
as both teams were quick enough 
to crash the two-meters without 
committing to a drop. The Tritons 
also had success on their man-down 
defense as they were able to stop UC 
Davis on its three 6-on-5 opportuni-
ties with a few field blocks and a good 
stop from freshman goalkeeper Mark 
Stemler.

Head coach Denny Harper had 

some rare praise for Stemler and 
freshman goalkeeper Adam Rule, 
who split playing time against the 
Aggies.

“One problem we’ve had all sea-
son is consistently poor play from our 
goalies,” head coach Denny Harper 
said. “But Stemler and Rule played 
really well this game. They were out-
standing.”

The opening minutes of the sec-
ond quarter were much like the first 
quarter’s play, as both teams were 
held scoreless. With 4:35 left in the 
half, UC Davis opened up the scoring 
on a counterattack goal and added 
another goal shortly after on a 6-on-5

It seems that the UCSD women’s 
volleyball team has finally found its 
groove. After struggling to achieve any 
kind of consistent play through the 
first half of the season, the Tritons are 
at last playing nearly at their peak.

Guided by resilient defense and a 
powerful offense, the No. 20 Tritons 
swept their two weekend matches, 
dominating Cal State Stanislaus 30-24, 
30-26, 30-25 on Oct. 19 followed by a 
stellar performance the next day with 
a 30-25, 31-29, 30-27 win over No. 19 
Chico State. With the victories, UCSD 
boosted its record to 15-6 overall — 
and more importantly, took over a 
share of second place in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association with a 
league record of 9-4. 

Head coach Tom Black said that 
he feels that the players haven’t quite 
reached their highest level but are pro-
gressing. 

“We’re on our way to reaching our 
peak and last night was a big step,” he 
said. “Hopefully we reach that peak in 
the final games of conference play and 
into playoffs.”

on Oct. 19, the Tritons didn’t disap-

Seniors Blake Meister and Eric 
Rubens are used to success as a doubles 
team, coming off a 19-4 season and 
school-best Final Four finish a year ago. 
The Intercollegiate Tennis Association 
All-Americans trekked to Mobile, 
Ala. and continued the success, taking 
home some heavy hardware during 
the ITA National Championships, a 
prestigious tennis showcase that took 
place from Oct. 11 to Oct. 14. 

To begin their unprecedented 
run, the duo claimed the Division II 
Men’s Doubles title, and then won 
the ITA Super Bowl of Small College 
Tennis two days later, completing 
an impressive weekend. The win 
clinched a spot in the ITA Division I 
Indoor Championships at Ohio State 
University from Nov. 1 to Nov. 4, a 
tournament where the Triton combo 
will be the only Division II representa-
tive in the draw.

The doubles team had to win all 
five of its matches over the four days to 
earn a spot at the exclusive Division I 
tournament and according to Meister, 
he and Rubens were running on all 
cylinders.

“We played great the entire tour-
nament,” Meister said. “We had to 
because there were some pretty close 
matches.”

In the D-II tournament, Rubens 
and Meister took out their first round 
opponents, Joerg Ekkenga and Leos 
Jelinek of Valdosta State, by a score 
of 7-6 (6), 7-6 (7). The win was espe-
cially satisfying because it was Valdosta 
State that took down UCSD in the 
Final Four of the Division II Team 
Tournament last season.

Following that victory, the Tritons’ 
top doubles pair defeated Ryan Hudson 
and Juan Nunez of Abilene Christian 

University of Abilene, Texas, 7-5, 7-5, 
to put themselves in the finals. In the 
championship match, the top-seeded 
doubles team took home their first 
title by getting past Dagoberto Darezzo 
and Edward Horne of the University 
of South Carolina-Aiken. The 7-6 (2), 
6-3, 10-8 victory was “a match we defi-
nitely could have lost,” Meister said. 
Blake added, “Eric came up huge dur-
ing the late stages of the match, hitting 
a big serve at 8-8, then a great return at 
9-8 to clinch the win for us.”

As champions of the Division II 
Doubles tournament, Rubens and 
Mesiter were automatically drawn into 
the ITA Super Bowl of Small College 
Tennis where the doubles champi-
ons from Division II, III, National  
Association of Intercollegiate Athletics 
and junior colleges came together with 
a spot at the Division I Indoors on the 
line. First, UCSD’s top doubles team 
faced the Division III champs, Filip 
Marinkovic and Andrew Thompson 
from Middlebury College in Vermont, 
and came out on top with a 6-3, 3-6, 
10-3 victory. Rubens and Meister were 
able to win their second trophy of the 
trip with a 7-6 (6), 7-5 win over the 
Fresno Pacific University team of Matt 
Carroll and Vicente Joli.

Rubens and Meister ended last sea-
son as the nation’s fourth best doubles 
team, according to the Fila collegiate 
tennis rankings. They are determined 
to improve on that standing, having 
already beaten one of the teams that 
finished ahead of them last year.

Meister has enjoyed his opportuni-
ty to play alongside Rubens and hopes 
the pair’s cohesion can propel them 
toward a better finish than last year.

“Last year, it was awesome to 
finish fourth,” Meister said. “But as 
seniors we relish the chance to play

No. 16 Tritons Topple CCAA Foe
By Jake Blanc
Staff Writer

Just as the San Diego sun set 
over Triton Soccer Field early on 
Oct. 19, the UCSD women’s soccer 
team made one last futile attempt to 
push the ball toward the Chico State 
goal, hoping for an equalizing goal 
to send the game into overtime. As 
was the pattern all game long, the 
Tritons just could not penetrate the 
Chico State defense and fell victim 
to the Wildcats, 1-0, for their second 
straight home loss. 

With only three games left in 
the regular season, UCSD proved 
that its aspirations of a national 
championship are not unfounded 
by bouncing back on Oct. 21 with 
a resounding 4-0 win over Cal State 
Stanislaus. The game was accen-
tuated by an overpowering Triton 
offense that scored three first-half 
goals and dominated the time of 
possession.

The recent UCSD losses have 
coincided with an expanding 
injured-reserve list. The makeshift 
lineup has been doing its best to 
step in, and the Triton bench has 
performed admirably. 

“We’ve been missing a couple of 
starters due to injuries lately and 
that has been really hard on us,” 
senior midfielder Chelsey Campbell 
said. “[Junior] Amanda Esquivel 
and [senior] Stacy Johnson are our 
two outside defenders, so right now 
we’re missing two out of our three 
defenders and that’s hard to over-
come. Stacy has been out for almost 
a month but we’re looking to get her 

back next Friday, so that should be 
a big lift.”

The first 30 minutes of Friday’s 
game saw UCSD and Chico State 
trading offensive drives that fell 
short. Each team had opportunities, 
especially from corner kicks, but 
was unable to capitalize. 

“We didn’t have some luck 
behind us versus Chico [State],” 
senior defender Nicole Pepper said. 
“We had opportunities but we didn’t 
have that extra oomph that we need-
ed. Sometimes we have dry spells. It 
happens in soccer and sometimes 
the best team doesn’t win.”

In the 31st minute when the 
Triton defense was trying to clear 
the ball, a UCSD turnover deflect-
ed the ball back into Wildcat pos-
session in front of the goal, and 
Chico State forward Melissa Lindsay 
was able to beat junior goalkeeper 
Jessica McGovern with a low, hard 
shot that was just beyond the reach 
of McGovern’s dive. The goal proved 
to be the game-winner, as neither 
team was able to score again. 

UCSD simply could not penetrate 
Chico State’s unusually tall defense 
the rest of the game, managing only 
five shots on goal. For a Triton team 
not known for its height, the obsta-
cle of four tall Wildcats blocking the 
goal was too much to overcome. 

“We never really got to connecting 
good passes and getting good plays 
together so we ended up having the 
midfielders playing the ball up in the 
air,” senior midfielder Ali Lai said. 
“Their entire back line was at least ERIK JEPSEN/GUARDIAN

Five-foot-6-inch senior midfielder Chelsey Campbell had a hard time shooting over the tall Chico State 
defenders on Oct. 19, but she assisted on a header for a goal in a 4-0 win over Cal State Stanislaus on Oct. 21.
