Athletic Field 
Almost Complete 

(about the funding)," said 
Hunt. "At last something will 
be done about the currently 
overcrowued conditions. The 
new field, 400 yards by 300 
yards, is almost double the size 
of any other field on campus." 

By Jad, W",lton 
&&.If Writer 

For all the harried, despon-
dent athletes who have fre-
quently been unable to find an 
available playing field - some 
new relief is in si,ht. Another 
field, the largest yet, is nearing 
th~ completion stages of 
construction at its site on the 
knoll Just east of Central 
Library (abutting the new 
parking 10tL.. Hopes are that it 

will be .... by Nov. 15. 
"Before this year, we had 

less 'grass space' than any 
other UC camp ." IBid 
Howard Hunt, chairman of the 
UCSD Physical Education 
Dept. "Santa Barbara and 
Davis had nearly three times as 
much. With 6,000 students 
participating in our intramural 
program and a full-ti!11e inter-
collegiate schedule going on 
simultaneously, plus regular 
classes and recreation, there 
was a clear need for more grass 
space to alleviate the over-
crowded conditions." 

The second field is in the 
planning stages right now, but 
construction has been tem-
porarily delayed. "The field 
will be located next to Third 
College, just west 'of it, where 
the new Third College Aca-
demic Unit 2 is currently being 
constructed, " said Hunt. The 
reason for the delay, he 
explained, is that the area is 
currently serving as an as-
sembly yard for the other 
structures going up nearby, 
and it would be hazardous to 
start working on the field now. 
Hunt said he hopes to have the 
second field ready by next fall. 

"With the addition of both 
fields, we should be able to 
meet all our projected needs," 
asserted Hunt, " at least until 
the. University experiences 
more growth." Hunt mentioned 
the importance of his philo-
sophy that a sound mind must 
go with a soUnd body, and 
therefore recreational needs 
should be given equal weight as 
academic demands. 

"Another major benefit 
derived from the projects is 
that we will now be on par with 
other schools in the system," 
said Hunt. "We haven't been 
able to host certain All-Cal 
events in the past (Le. occer, 
rugby) due to the lack of grass 
space." 

Hunt added that the most 
pressing need after the fields 
are finished will be for another 
pool. "Our pool gets the most 
use of any facility - it is in use 
from early morning to late 
night without a break." Hunt

Rally Against Racism 
Faults Flew, Guardian 

By Jeff Beresford-Howe 
Auoclale News Ed1&or 

A crowd of about ISO people 
gathered on the Gym steps 
Wednesday at noon to hear 
eight speakers denounce An-
thony Flew as "racist" or just 
simply" stupid" and The 
Guardian as sensationalist and 
"unresponsive to the needs of 
students. " 

The rally was in response to 
an article in last Friday's 

uardian profiling Anthony 
Flew, a Philosophy professor 
visiting this year from 
England. 

In that profile, Flew labeled 
"reverse discrimination" as 
"racist" and dealt with black 
society and its relationship to 

lack achievement and be-
havior. 

Herbert Marcuse, a UC 
rofessor Fmeritus, told the 

receptive crowd that the 
"printing of the interview was 
in support of racism ... It serves 

to perpetuate and justify 
racism and discrimination." 
Marcuse placed Flew's com-
ments as part of a society which 
"is still a racist society, with 
reactionary and regressive 
trends and with the few meas-
ures to promote equality 
destroyed. " 

Shirley Williams and Carlos 
Blanco, both UCSD literature 
professors called for a teach-in 
to deal with the problem of 
racism, and both suggested 
that professors with "racist" 
viewpoints not be invited to 
teach at UCSD. 

J ames Curtis of the Black 
Students Union added in a later 
speech that' "with luck, we can 
get (Flew) to leave by Christ-
mas." 

Some speakers implicated 
The Guardian in their attacks 
on Flew. Lenny Edward of The 
People's Voice called The 
Guardian the "catalyst" for the 

because of its 

alleged support ' of racist 
viewpoints. 

Ann Marie Isachsen read a 
circular with six specific 
allegations against The Guard-
ian (see page 2) accusing the 
newspaper of being unre-
sponsive to students, especially 
minorities, and of practicing 
irresponsible journalism. 

Flew, reached yesterday, 
declined comment on the rally 
or The Guardian story, other 
than to say " I don't recognize 
myself in that story." He will 
have a written response to 
charges against him, he did 
say, but wasn 't yet sure 
whether he'd release it. 

Other speakers at the rally 
included Bernie Campbell, a 
Catholic Priest from the Office 
of Religious Affairs, who 
depicted Flew's remarks as 
" profoundly stupjd with at best 
only a glancing connection with 
reality, and students repre-
.,ot;lJLIIIJI: the BSU and MEChA. 

Hunt explained how the lack 
of adequate grass space led to 
the overused condition of the 
existing facilities, severely 
hamperiq daytime utilization 
and making it impossible to 
aaot t1mt. for improvement and 
proper maintenance. 

Last year, government funds 
became available through the 
San Diego ReI10nal Employ-
ment Training Consortium 
(RETSI), an a,ency which 
distributes federal funds for 
projects that meet specific 
criteria derived from the 
Department of Labor. Some of 
these criteria, for example, are 
that Lie project must be heavily 
labor-oriented, employees 
must meet CETA eu,lbillty 
guidelines and DO tban 
100/0 of the fundiDllMY be used 
for non-labor purposes. The 
athletic field proposal qualified 
(or a significant percentage of 
its total fundin, to come from 
RETSI, and the University 
made up the difference to bring 
the total to approximately 
$115,000. Another Physical 
Education Department pro-
posal (put to,ether through 
Architects and Engineers) also 
qualified (or federal funds; this 
proposal was for a second 
athletic field, about half the size 
of the first. 

'Massive' Parking Fee Possible 

"We were greatly pleased 

By JeD Beresford-Howe 
Auodale News Edller 

Andy Schneider, acting 
assistant mana,er of Parking 
Services, told the AS Council 
Wednesday night that the $1 per 
quarter Increase in parkine 
fees was the "Minimum in-

crease possible," and that a 
massive Increase in parking 
fees is still possible. 

Schneider, a Muir student 
and House Advisor who is 
taking the quarter off to 
manage parking services, said 

that the parking fee increase 
will be used to fund alternative 
means of transportation for 
employees at University Hos-
pital in Hillcrest. 

After eighteen months the 
alternative means of trans-

Plenty of Parking Available? 

portation will be evaluated. 
Schneider told the Council. If 
the alternative means are 
found lacking, then fees will be 
raised in order to build a multi-
level parking structure near 
the hospital, at the coat of 
approximately $500 per space. 
This would require a fee raise to 
a level over tbe $100 UC 
Berkeley and UC Los Angeles 
students pay, said Schneider. By Pam Day 

One hundred and forty-five 
vehicles were ticketed on Oct. 
11 for parki:!g illegally on 
Revelle and Muir campuses. 
Andy Schneider, acting assis-
tant manaaer for Parkin, 
Serviees said there is no renson 
for this, as then- are plenty of 
spaces to accommodate the 
students. According to 
Schneider, over 4,000 permits 
were issued to students this 
year, with approximately 5,000 
spaces available. 

There are 200 spaces avail-
able on John HopIdns Road 

near Central Library, said 
Schneider. The lot adjacent to 
old Miramar Road also has 200 
spaces, while North Torrey 
Pine. Road has hundreds of 
spaces available and 50 to 150 
spaces behind the Medical 
school are vacant every day, he 
said. All student parkin, i! 
within 15 minutes walkini 
distance from the center ot 
campus, he added. 

Schneider attributes the 
parking problem to the housin, 
shorta,e on campus, parking 
space turn-over and an in-
crease in prooertv value. The 

on-campus housiot shortage 
has forced student. to move 
elsewhere and, coupled with a 
41% increase in property value 
this year, students have been 
forced to fiod cheaper housing 
north aDd east of the campus, 
accordiJtg to Schneider. The 
tenn " tum-over" refers 
to the number of times a 
is relinqut.hed during the day. 

This year over 52% of the 
tudents drive individual cars, 

which account for inadequat

offended that the campus press

Independent, aa a new.paper, 
becau.e it exl.t. .olely on 
advertilinJ, wbicb II to say it is 
dependent on its advertisers 
for ill existence. It becomes 
clear that the editorial poUcies 
of the paper are more con-
cerned with servinJ the needs 
of Its advertilen, by increaaing 
circulation by printinl any 
new. copy, no matter bow 
racllt, DO matter bow sexist, no 
matter how offenaive to the 
student community. 

It II obviOUI that any student 
control over tbe poUciea and 
practices of TIle GunUu are 
abeent, However we do have a 
riPt to lOme accountability. 
CoDaider two facti: (1) tbe 
blile IUJIlI of student Monies in 
the fonn of ReJistration fees 
and student activity fees 
invested in the TT/Guardian 
over the past decade or so, (2) 
the present location of The 
Guardiaa in offices built and 
maintained by student monies. 
Finally, consider journalistic 
accountability, and lbe rela-
tionship of The Guardian to the 
student body. 

Flew Missed Point 

(3) That in the light of tbe 
silence in Tbe G.ardiaa's 
pages on the oqoing concerns 
of minorities and women as 
voiced by campus groups, this 
fron t- page coverage to an 
incredibly racist viewpoint by 
an influential professor, at a 
time when the economic situa-
tio n is growing worse and 
access to higher e.ducation 
a mong minorities is being · 
blocked by the Bakke decision, 
is detrimental and insulting to 
minorities on campus. 

(4) Tbat no assurance has 
been given by TIle Guardian 
that ~y will attempt io change 
their policy of underrepresen-
tation, that besides printing 
letters of reaction wben lbey 
print conservative stances on 
Inflammatory iuues, they will 
also try to gain progreasive 
stances, that tbey might print 
out their interviews in a 
question/answer format that 
would place some respon-
sibility on the reporter to ask 
incisive questions. 

The Guardian does not view 
the UCSD student body as a 
constituency, but as a com-
mercial market to be sold, to be 
exploited. Instead of providing 
a potentially productive, 
constructive toot of lbe student 
body, it continues to merely 
provide a favorable advertising 
base for the powers that be. We 
have seen time and time again 
that The Guardian Is not 
responsible in any way to the 
students of this university . Who 
then is it responsible to? 
Consider the $7SOO subsidy the 
paper receives from the Chan-
cellor's Discretionary Fund. 
Who then is lbis paper rep-
resenting? Whose interests 
does TIle Guardian guard? Not 
ours. 

Editor: 
Professor Anlbony Flew's 

remarks on " positive dis-
crimination" entirely miss the 
point as regards Affirmative 
Action admission policies. No 
reasonable person would sug-
gest that these policies will be 
of any benefit to black persons 
long since deceased. 

In fact, compensation for an 
" bistorical injustice" is not lbe 
essential defense of these 

admission policies . Rather , 
these policies seek to revert 
the social and economic con-
sequences that systematic 
exc lusion from higher edu-
cation (coupled with the 
segregation of lower edu-
cation) have had on racial 
minorities within our society.

Dumb vs. Stupid 
A Question of Ignorance 

Editor: 
A friend of mine ma kes a 

distinction between dumb and 
stupid. Dumb being an ig-
110 ance of a topic through no 
Ca plt of one ' s own - i. e . 
f-xf:emely limited experience 
mil opportunity. Stupid being 

~10 ignorance of a topic when 
rhtough one's experience and 
() P. ortunit)' QIIe could be 
lte sonably expected- to know 
Ii~ understand. The remarks 
"rr4'riday's Guardian by one 
'~fesses to be a knower of 

:liety and its structures and " 11 0 yet speaks of blacks and Q er minorities - (I suspect 
my for forebears - the Irish 
might be included) as crim-
ina" and is only bemused about 
family structure - such re-
maru are profoundly stupid. 

A. leie from lbe stupidity of 
the article and its at best only 
, lancin, connection with the 
real world - tb e re is a n 

assumption in the article that 
disturbs me as a Christian. As 
one who professes with otbers 
the Cbristian Creed on Sunday 
and hopefully lives it during the 
week tbat I believe in the 
communion of saints,l am very 
disturbed by tbe glib and 
callous dismissal of the dead. 
Whether many of the readers of 
the student newspaper sbare 
tm~ llpecific expreuion is not as 
important as lbe reality the 
expreuion seeks to give voice 
to. 

Remember in the old war 
movies bow the guards would 
always bring new blankets to 
the prisoners on the day of the 
Red Crou Visit. All smiles and 
politeness - no past bistory of 
cruelty and torture . The 
promise of a NEW DAY is 
shattered after the Red Cross 
leaves. Busineas as usual -, 
torture and cruelty. Forget 

(PIeue""u.paie 10) 

from nearly two bundred years 
of discrimination. Thus" the 
focus of these policies, wbile 
rooted in an historical injustice, 
is clearly on the future . 

Should ' race be a relevant 
characteristic only when one 
group wishes to discriminate 
against anolber; but not when 
the desire is to nullify tbe 
effects of that discrimination?

Pontiff 
To Visit Lebanon 

Call 454-7232 

VATICAN CITY (AP) -
Pope John Paul II assured 
Lebanese Maronlte bisbops 
today that be would do every-
thing in bis power to bring 
peace to Lebanon, including a 
visit to the war-torn country, 
Lebanese church leaders said. 

Emerging from a papal 
audience, Antoine Pierre 
Khoraiche, patriarch of Anti-
och, told reporters the pope 
expressed the hope that the 
truce in Lebanon could be 
transformed into a permanent 
peace agreement. 

John Paul II received the 
patriarch and three otber 
Maronite bisbops after a 45-
minute audience with French 
President Valery Giscard 
d'Estaing. 

Giscard d'Estaing said they 
discussed a wide range of 
" burning world issues " in-
cluding ways to bring about 
"peace in a unified Lebanon." 

In his first papal speech on 
Oct. 17, John Paul II indicated 
that he would pay prompt 
a ttention to the Lebanese 
question . He spoke of the 
" grave" problem in " the 
beloved land of Lebanon and its 
people who earnestly desire 
peace and liberty."

The drug, Vidarabine: was 
developed by Parke, Davia " 
Co. of Detroit, which plans to 
market it under the trade name 
Vlra-A. 

In studies sponsored by the 
National Institutes of Healtb, 
the drug slashed the death rate 
caUled by Herpes encephaUtia 
from 70 percent to 28 percent 
and substantially reduced the 
brain damage often suffered by 
survivors of the rare disease. 

In diseases caused by a virua, 
whether it be the common cold, 
influenza, polio or other life-
threatening disorders such as 
Herpes encephalitis, science 
can treat only the symptoms 
while the illness runs its course 
and the body itself fights back. 

Dr. Robert Buchanan of 
Parke, Davis, who gave the 
first dose of Vidarabine to a 
patient in 1971, said the newly 
approvid drug ., is not a 
penicillin" because it won't 
have such widespread applica-
tions against so many diseases. 
But he added that test results 
will be published soon showing 
Vidarabine is effective against 
the member of the Herpes 
family of viruses that causes 
Herpes zoster, commonly 
called shingles.

Film Review 
'Boys' Is Great 

By John Hous&on 
Thirty-five years have 

passed since the Second World 
War ended and it is as popular 
now as it has ever been. The 
Nazis have always provided 
good story material for novel-
ists and screenwriters. as is 
documented by the countless 
books and movies on the 
subject. Why are so many 
people eager to relive the reign 
of terror the Nazis brought? 

Perhaps it is because we came 
so close to having a totalitarian 
world. Maybe people have a 
need 'to cringe in horror at the 
retelling of the Nazi atrocities. 

Lord Lew Grade decided to 
capitalize on the concept and 
has produced an impressive 
movie, THE BOYS FROM 
BRAZIL, directed by Franklin 
Schaffner. Lord Lew's formula 
for a successful movie is to buy 
a bestseller, in this case THE 

(Please 'urn &0 pale 1) 

By Lyne'te Tom 
His broad stature seems built 

for the more strenuous work-
outs of a physical education 
coach than the classroom 
lectures of an associate Profes-
sor of Music. However, within 
the tall figure 01 Cecil Lytle lies 
an individual whose insights 
into music have rightfully 
earned him the title of UCSD's 
"Piano Man." 

"I didn't choose music; it 
chose me," he confessed. 

A major contribution to the 
development of this native New 
Yorker's musical savvy can be 
found in the form of his father, a 
Baptist church organist. The 
elder Lytle has served not only 
as an inspiration for his 
youngest son alone, but the rest 
of his eleven offspring as well. 
The influence is clearly in 
Cecil's three jazz musician 
brothers and his opera singer 
sister. 

"It was a family experience 
as well as a musical experi-
ence," he recalled. 

His musical training under 
his father's guidance led him to 
the piano. From then on, he had 
eyes for no other instrument. 
Lytle's choice has proven to be 
a wise one, as he has graced the 
grounds of the Oberlin Conserv-
atory and the University of 
Wisconsin. His studies under 
classical music professors of 
such notable reputation asPaul 
Badura-Skoda and Gunnar 
Johansen have paid off in his 
first place-winning perfor-
mance in tbe International 
Liszt Competition and his 
finalist position in the National 
Young Artists Competition. 

However , Lytle ' s heart 
doesn't belong to just classical 
music. He can play an Ellington 
piece with the same vigor and 

intensity of a Brahms concerto. 
His interests in jazz are also 
demonstrated in bis admiration 
for pianist Thelonius Monk, 
whom he considers as "a real 
genius not for being a virtuoso, 
but for having musical ideas," 
and sax player Charlie Parker, 
better known as "Bird. " 

"What is fascinating about 
these two men is that they lived 
in a different age of music 
where one knew the musicians 
from the area and their part in 
the community," he explained. 
"It wasn't unusual to go to an A 
& P and see the musicians 
buying groceries there." 

To many, his musical ten-
dencies would seem an unlikely 
combination. Although Lytle 
admits that the coupling of 
classical and jazz music isn't 
common, he is quick to affirm 
that the younger musicians, 
including himself, are turning 
toward that direction, giving 
Keith Jarrell as a prime 
example. 

"I think it's an antiquated, 
uncool notion of specializing 
one's musical interests into -a 
cultural cocoon," he stated. 

First touring the United 
States as a solo pianist in 
chamber music, Gospel and 
jazz , Lytle ' s performances 
have expanded into appear-
ances with the Boston Sym-
phony Orchestra, Madison 
Summer Symphony and La 
Jolla Symphony, a duet recital 
with Tamas Ungar, and col-
laborations with Sarah 
Vaughn, Ja s Brown and 
Charlie Mingus. However, 
Lytle's fondest memories of his 
concerts concern a Los Angeles 
engagement with clarinetist 
Barney Bigard. 

"He has such a mastery of his 
instrument and such musical 

wisdom that if be plays four 
notes, those four notes would 
say more than if they were 
played by any other musician," 
he remarked of his childhood 
hero. "I think all musicians 
should bave a chance to work 
with a real master of his craft." 

Lytle has also toured in 
England, Austria, Germany 
and Mexico. 

On the scholastic aspectofhis 
music career, Lytle's teaching 
credits include two institutions 
of higher education. The first 
was Iowa 's Grinnell College, 
which specializes in liberal 
arts. There, he established a 
jazz group and a Gifted Black 
Gospel Choir. Four years ago, 
he made the move to UCSD, 
where he encountered what he 
calls "a cultural shock" in 
terms of the laid-back Iifestlyle 
of Southern California , the 
drastic increase of student 
population from Grinnell (1200) 
to UCSD (10 ,000) , and the 
availability of funds for courses 
and research versus the 
process in receiving them. 

Lytle's appearance at the 
unjversity has also sparked the 
formation of a jazz music 
program consisting of several 
jazz ensembles and a Gospel 
Choir. So far, the program has 
been greeted with positive 
student response. 

" The turnout has been con-
Sistently high and the audi-
ences have been enthusiastic," 
he said. 

In terms of research, Lytle 
has presented a paper {'on· 
cerning the relationship be-
tween blues and rock music to 
an American Music Conference 
held at Keele University in 
England this summer.

the Wednesday Evening Series 
at the Mandeville Center. He is 
no stranaer to such events, 
since he has had two to three 
performances at UCSD each 
year. However, this will be his 
first solo concert in a Wednes-
day Evening Series, having 
appeared previously in a 
chamber music group and a 
two-piano concert. 

"It's a ' connoisseur's pro-
gram whose music deserves to 
be heard and where prior 
knowledge (of the composers) 
can be helpful," he stated. 

Now in its third year. the 
objective of the Wednesday 
Evening Series Is. according to 
Lytle, "bringing and pre-
senting interesting people." As 
a result, the concerts often 
border on the unique, or as he 
puts it, "kinky." This year's 
series is no exception. Fol·

will be SONOR (January 31).

"It' s an interesting and

explained. "The audience 
becomes involved." 

His last remark refers to the 
African Music and Dance 
Ensemble, where members of 
the audience will be asked to 
participate on the stage along 
with the group. 

For Lytle, the rest of the 
academic year will be a 
combination of concerts lind 
teaching. His performance 
schedule goes as follows:

"I'm excited that my profes-
sional career is opening up in . 
terms of playing a wider 
variety of music and more 
performances," he concluded. 
"I'd like to make music in as 
many ways and as much as

Need For a Trainer 
When Rhys came to UCSD 

last year he went to see Judy 
Sweet, Intercollegiate Athletic 
Director, and talked to her 
about the possibility of hiring a 
trainer. "In August she called 
me and offered me the on 

a part-time basiB ," Rhys 
explained. II All the other UC 
schools bad certified trainers 
and I thought UCSD had the 
need for one, too." 

To become fully certified 
Rhys attended Cal State Los 
Angeles and also worked as a 
student trainer for six years. 
He is now a member of the 
National Trainers Association, 
the only training organization 
recognized by universities and 
professional sports. Rhys 
worked in scbools in New York. 
California, and for the San 
Gabriel Saints of West Coast 
minor league pro football. Most 
recently he spent three yea rs at 
CSU Los Angeles as the assis-
tant trainer. 

"Hopefully by 1979 this can be 
a full-time position at UCSD 
because there' is a definite need 
for it," Rhys explained. "I keep 
sign-up sheets, lists, personal 
records, and progress reports 
for all the people I see. When it 
comes time to evaluate the 
program these things will help 
prove the necessity of ex-
pansion." 

Judy Sweet explained that an 
allocation will be made regu-
larly for the training program. 
"In the future there may be a 
need for a full-time athletic 
trainer," she added. 

Rhys says that he gets the 
most injuries from water polo, 
soccer and basketball. " I find 
that the most common injuries 
are to the shoulder, 

with water polo players 
throw the ball incorrectl 
After shoulders, the mos 
frequent casualties 
sprained ankles and 
injuries." 

"Warm-ups are really 
important," stresses Rhys. 

Sweet Impressed 
Judy Sweet is impressed with 

the training program so far. " It 
has given a tremendous boost to 
our athletic program. It makes 
me feel secure in the type of 
treatment our athletes are 
getting." 

What does Rhys do when an 
athlete wants to play but is not 
completely healed or ready for 
action? " I give him other 
exercises to do that will keep 
him in shape, alternatives that 
will keep him active. If he 
insists on playing, against my 
better judgement, then I just go 
have a talk with the coach and 
the athlete won't play if deemed 
necessary. 

. ' Increasing the athletic 
program for sports medicine 
and decreasing the amount of 
injuries through preventive 
medicine" are among the goals 
Rhys Danylyshyn-Adams has 
for the UCSD training pro-
gram. lO r would also like to 
develop my own student trainer 
program." Presently Rhys is 
looking for work-stUdy students 
interested in student training, 
preferably with a first a id 
background.

play, soccer coach Stewart 
Hayes ' group of innocent 
bystanders again got mugged, 
this time by San Diego State, 4-
O. 

The Triton squad, outscored 
12~ in the past three games, hit 
a slump, but is now "playing 
better than ever before," 
according to Hayes. After a 
team meeting Tuesday "the 
guys came out wanting to play. 
They're working as a team 
now." 

Against the Aztecs, who 
recently upset NAIA seventh-
ranked Simon Fraser of British 
Columbia , motivation just 
wasn't enough to win. UCSD 
left the field at halftime trailing 
2~, a score not indicative of

their play. They held SDSU to 
four or five shots and only a few 
penetrations in the half. One 
goal came when an Aztec 
player kicked a hard shot from 
over 20 yards out, and goalie 
Clay Carley, screened from 
view of the play, couldn't react 
in time to stop it. 

Hayes made some player 
changes in the second period, 
and the State squad took 
advantage of several drives to 
put in two more goals. 

Still. the outlook is not all bad

Parking Spaces 
In Short Supply 

New Field 
Planned 
(Cont. from page 1) 

~"ould come before the students 
in Jan . on the question of 
building a spacious sport 
complex west of Scripps Hos-
pital. "This would include a 
pool, more gym floor space, 
and a variety of other things. 
It·s really a whale of a buy for 
the students. who would have 
free acceu to it once it was paid 
for by a rise in reg fees." Hunt 
explained that staff and faculty 
have to pay for the U8e of such 
facilities by purchasing a 
recreation card. thereby con-
tributing at least as much 
financially as the students. 

(CODt. from pale 1) 
crease over last year, ex-
plained _Schneider. 

Schneider points out the K. 
Wally Bear Program - car and 
van-pooling services - is 
available for commuter stu-
dents. There is also C09per-
ation from the San Diego 
Transit Buses for local trans-
portation. Routes 21, 30. 34 and 
41 will take students from the 
Mesa apartments to campus 
and from campus to Scripps for 
free. all students have to .do is 

obtain a special pass from 
Parking Services. 

It is not likely, said 
Schneider. that new parking 
lots will be available before 
Juoe. However, the possibility 
of 600 new spaces by Sept. of 
1979 exists. Four hundred, 
spaces around Muir and Third 
are due for completion by the 
end of summer and 200 spaces 
behind the Warren playiog field 
are slated for comph:tion by the 
fall. 

Remarks Were Stupid 
(COIlt. from palel) 
your past - forget your roots-
forget your people's sufferings. 
their hope for liberation, their 
dreams fleshed out in often 
difficult lives. Forget Aush-
witz. Forget the death ships 
from Ireland or Africa. Forget 

your people's brownness , 
blackness. lrishness - and we. 
the Guardians, of the good, true 
and beautiful. we the guardians 
of power and prestige in all 
kinds of institutions (be that the 
academic world of Oxford. 
Harvard or U CSD. or of govern-

ment or the church) will accept 
you. And like the prisoners of 
all those "B" 40s and 50s 
movies. we will be worse off 
than before we obediently 
forgot - for we will become not 
prisoners with hope but guards 
with no vision. 

At a meeting last week with 
an Ecumenical group of Chris-
tians concerned with justice 
and peace. an American Indian 
said that all too often Ameri-
cans think of justice as - JUST 
US-

A justice which rules out the 
past as meaning less is the 
justice ofthe guards. It is smug, 
it is small, it is truly DEATH. 

Rev. Bernard J . Campbell 
Catholic Chaplain. UCSD 

UCSD Loses 
(Coat. from pale t) 
for UCSD . The team per-
formance encouraged Hayes 
and the players, who need 
effective ballplay in their 
remaining four games to 
qualify for the NAIA playoffs. 

Masood Badri thought he 
played the best game of his life 
Wednesday. guarding the same 
player he guarded last year 
when he was a back at USIU. 

Finally, star forward Greg 
Lyons is expected to regain his 
eligibility in time for next 
Tuesday 's .match against 
Azusa Pacific. "Lyons is a real 
hard worker. He goes up and 
down the field for us," said the 
UCSD coach.
