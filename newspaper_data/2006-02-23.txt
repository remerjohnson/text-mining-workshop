SENIOR STAFF WRJTER 

The definition of the "UCSD 
experience" and the ways in which 
the campus could pull students, 
faculty and admini tration into a 
collective community were the top-
ics emphasized by A.S. President 
Christopher Sweeten in the fir t 
annual State of the Campus address, 
a speech about the events that have 
transpired during the 2005-06 stu-
dent government term. 

In the address, Sweeten dis-
cussed the various programs avail-
able to help with tutoring, financial 
aid and student outreach, as well 
as the status of the federal bud-

Television and UCSD's relationship 
to the La Jolla community. 

"Students will continue to gradu-
ate from a great university, but want 
nothing to do with it once they 
graduate," Sweeten said, describing 
a lack of Triton spirit illustrated in 
the recent Undergraduate Student 
Experience and Satisfaction report. 

He proposed several remedies, 
including increased interaction 
between the six colleges and recon-
sideration of standing policies that 
instill a feeling of allegiance to a 
particular college and not the uni-
versity itself. 

"As soon as you walk through

said. "You should be UCSD."

Revelle College senior Andrew 
Lai passed away last week from inju-

on UCSD reserve lands. The UCSD 
Police Department has ruled the 
death an apparent suicide, accord· 
ing to the lead investigator, detec-

The incident was initially report-
ed at approximately 3 p.m. on Feb. 
10, when a lifeguard helicopter 
spotted Lai at the bottom of a ravine 
near the west end of the La Jolla

UCSD police responded, because 
the land is considered part of the

Lai was then transported to 
Scripps Memorial Hospital, where 
he underwent treatment for a week 
before succumbing to his wounds 
on Feb. 17. Lai had ·suffered major 
head trauma from falling 50 to 75 
feet into the ravine, Smart said. 

Although investigations will

Sex Gene May 

Explain Parkinson'S 
A sex gene that makes embryos 

male and is responsible for the 
formation of testes has been linked 
to the brain region targeted by 
Parkinson's disease, which may 
explain why men develop the disor-
der much more often than women, 
according to the results of a new 
study by researchers at UCLA. 

In an unexpected discovery, 
UCLA human genetics professor 
Eric Vilain and his team traced a 
protein, which is manufactured by a 
gene on the male sex chromosome, 
to a region of the brain called the 
substantia nigra, which deteriorates 
in those with Parkinson's disease 
when cells in the region irreversibly 
malfunction and die. 

Vilain's team used a rat model to 
study the effect of the protei n on the 
brain . When the researchers low-
ered the level of the protein in the 
substantia nigra, they saw a corre-
sponding drop in an enzyme called 
tyrOSine hydroxylase. The research-
ers noticed the drop in tyrosine 
hydroxylase occurred in male rats, 
while female rats remained unaf-
fected. 

The results of the study suggest 
that variations in the protein lev-
e ls may be linked to the onset of 
Parkinson's, a chronic movement 
d isorder affecting nearly 1 million 

warren college stvdenf co~nCIi 

Americans, and could offer insights 
into why men are more at risk. 

UCSC Plays Tag 
With Sea Creatures 

Albatrosses, seals, sea lions, 
tuna fish and sharks have been 
outfitted with electronic tags in a 
new study by researchers at UC 
Santa Cruz that has yielded new 
information about the migrations 
and behavior of the animals and 
about the environments in which 
they live. 

UCSC ecology and evolution-
ary biology professor Daniel Costa 
and his team deployed electronic 
tags on 23 different apex predator 
species in the North Pacific Ocean 
that capture an animal's location, 
swim speed, and the depth and 
duration of the animal's dives. In 
addition, the tags record the tem-
perature and salinity of the sea-
water and how those properties 
change with ocean depth . 

As the animals travel along the 
coast, the electronic tags, which 
are fastened harmlessly to their 
bodies, transmit data back to the 
scientists via satell ite. 

Costa is also collaborating with 
Scottish researchers on a project 
in the waters around Antarctica 
to implement the same tracking 
system for southern elephant seals, 
fur seals and crabeater seals.

Dynes Admits Pay Flaws, 
Promises Policy Overhaul 

• HEARINGS, from page 1 
to top executives in multiple instances, 
including salary paid to former Senior 
Vice President of Academic Affairs 
M.R.C. Greenwood even after she 
resigned from her post, Parsley said. 

"UCOP needs to be reorganized ... 
to strengthen the management of the 
whole system~ he told the committee. 
"We're not going to rely on voluntary 
compliance going forward:' 

UC President Robert C. Dynes, 
who was strongly criticized by the 
committee in a separate set of hear-
ings held two weeks ago, admitted 
wrongdoing by granting Greenwood 
her salary. He acknowledged another 
UCOP mistake, in which a former 
UC Davis vice chancellor was given 
a two-year, $20S,OOO-a-year work-at-
home job with no precise duties after 
she threatened to sue the university for 
race and gender discrimination. 

"In my view, the payment .. . was 
a settlement, so it should have been 
reported to the regents," Dynes said. 
"Greenwood's full compensation was 
not written down as a disclosed pay-
menl It's a fact. Whether it was good 
or bad judgment, it's the truth:' 

Dynes went on to admit that the 
UC system is "broken" and promised 
to fix the problem. 

The university is in the middle of 
several audits, including one conduct-
ed by an independent fact-finder con-
tracted by the university and another 
by the state. The regents have focused 
on changes for some time, according to 
Regent Judith Hopkinson. In fact, she 
said, a study released by an indepen-
dent consulting finn last year revealed 
that top UC officials were 17 percent 
behind comparable market pay. 

Some senators took offense to the 
statistic, expressing doubt because the 
study's numbers did not include all 
forms of compensation. 

"This compensation practice is 

really kind of loosey-goosey.' state Sen . 
Jack Scott (0-Pasadena) said. "We have 
people getting paid for their sabbaticals 
and their board seats. After a while, we 
hear about a salary but that isn't really 
the full thing:' 

Sen. Abel Maldonado (R-Santa 
Maria), suggested that the regents 
establish an independent body that 
could ensure compliance with UC 
policies. Parsley agreed, but warned the 
lawmakers that establishing a duplicate 
staff of UCOP and other entities in the 
university would be wasteful 

Some senators criticized the regents, 
and said that the board did not do 
enough to stem problems caused by 
out-of-hand compensation practices. 
Sen. Jackie Speier (O-San Francisco/ 
San Mateo) suggested that the regents, . 
who are appointed by the governor and 
don't get paid for their service, were not 
committed enough to their jobs. 

"It malces me begin to think, con-
sidering what's at stake. if we should 
have appointed people with salaries 
attached to tbose positions to get them 
to tum this ship around; Speier said. 

Speier added that tlie UC system 
has many other problems that it must 
address, including lagging faculty 
compensation, and some senators 
said they were especially frustrated 
with the resurfaCing of compensation 
problems after legislators had chas-
tised the university on the same topic 
in the early 1990s. 

"We made a commitment to public 
knowledge and understanding of our 
payments then~ Parsky said "These 
principles remain the policy of the 
regents todaf. 

To enforce policy changes this time 
around, Parsley made a stark promise 
that some senators were pushing for: 
"If that means firing people, we wm."

Student Privacy Threatened by Wiretaps 
FCC wiretapping of 
university services 
could come with the 
exposure of student 
records, report says. 

By Matthew McArdle 
ASSOCIATE NEWS EDITOR 

The Federal Communications 
Commission is forcing universities 
to· comply with national wiretapping 
laws by making them alter private 
networks and the Internet, a move 
that could cost universities upwards 
of $7 billion and threaten the pri-
vacy of student records, according to 
reports from the American Council 
on Education. 

The FCC is trying to make uni-
versities more compliant with the 
Communications Assistance for 
Law Enforcement Act, enacted by 
Congress in 1994 to ensure that tele-
phone companies operate networks 
in a manner that allows law-enforce-
ment agencies to install wiretaps with 
court authorization, the A.C.£' report 
stated. 

At the University of California, the 
Information Technology Guidance 
Committee recently convened to 
address FCC demands and to decide 
how the university would comply 
with the CALEA mandates. 

According to UCSD student 
lTGP representative Vincent Pascual, 
the committee was concerned about 
CALEA because, through its provi-
sions, the university can be subpoe-
naed for medical records and other 
student records. 

"Law-enforcement agencies can 
now monitor usage of the Internet, 
Iinternet Telephonel, AOL Instant 
Messenger and even text messages 
sent via cell phone." Pascual said 
in a recent presentation to the A.S. 
Council. "Students have not been 

notitled of this usage of CALEA. We 
need to improve notification to stu-
dents ... and make sure they are clear 
about this monitoring:' 

Though the university normally 
complies with wiretapping requests, 
the current CALEA policy is not con-
ducive to student privacy, Pascual 
said. 

"The issue at point here has to do 
with the fact that CALEA does Dot 
serve as a good umbrella policy when 
it comes to privacy for UC networks~ 
he said. "The university is attempting 
to lobby against CALEA's umbrella 

~ .... ~ does not serve 
as good umbrella 

policy when it comes 
to privacy ... "

Representative, UC Information 

Technology Guidance Committee 

application to UC." 
The Higher Education Coalition, 

made up of various college groups. 
also opposes the FCC's extension of 
CALEA, and members of HEC indi-
cated in a November 2005 presenta-
tion to the FCC that there was no 
reason for universities to alter their 
current methods of networking. 

"Extending CALEA to such insti-
tutions is neither necessary to nation-
al security nor otherwise in the public 
interest, in light of the ... detrimental 
impact that significant compliance 
costs would have on higher educa-
tional and research mstitutions." the 
HEC report stated. 

Originally, the law extended 
only to telephone companies, and 
Congress exempted "information ser-
vices" such as Internet-access provid-
ers and "private networks" found at 

some universities and corporations. 
However, after the 200 1 terror-

ist attacks, the U.S. Department of 
Justice asked the FCC to expand 
CALEA coverage to services used 
.as "substantial replacements" for tra-
ditional telephone communication, 
including broadband Internet and 
online phone services. The FCC also 
mandated that CALEA provisions be 
extended by April 2007 to "facili -
ties-based Internet service providers." 
such as colleges and universities, who 
use their own equipment to make 
their Internet systems. FCC spokes-
man Mark Wigfield did not respond 
to requests for comment. 

The potential-'fmancial impact 
of altering university Internet ser-
vices would create a "bottleneck" for 
UCSD in order to meet the FCC's 
requirements, Academic Computing 
Services Director Tony Wood said 
last October. 

"What were concerned about is

a lot of money to do something we 
never have to, we don't want it." 

Terry W Hartle, the senior vice 
president of A.C.E., stated in a report 
that higher education is in a fIX 
because the FCC's new legal obli-
gations have been imposed without 
specifications on how compliance 
could be achieved. He indicated that 
the FCC is not clarifying exactly how 
it wants institutions of higher educa-
tion to become fully CALEA-compli-
ant, and that it won't move from its 
2007 deadline, creating a problem for 
universities. 

According to Hartle.- A.C.E. and 
a nonprofit group called Educause 
filed a lawsuit in January to block the 
FCC from proceeding until it ~ally 
explains exactly what it wants from 
universities. He indicated that a rul-
ing would be likely by August.

As the Internet Democratizes 
Knowledge, Some Cry Foul. 

For the Facebook 
Generation, going 
digital is a way of life 
and having access 
to the answer to any 
query is a given. 

By Vladimir Kogarr 
SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

I n the old days, when college students trekked 20 miles in the snow to the nearest library with 
a manual typewriter in tow, th!!y 
didn't have to submit their ingenious 
philosophical musings to Turnitin. 
com. Oh, but how the world has 
changed. 

This year, like none before it, 
is quickly making clear how the 
Information Age has transformed 
the lives of the Facebook Generation. 
which traces its lineage to the Baby 
Boomers and Generation X. Indeed, 
the college community on Facebook 
has become a microcosm for the 
fast-paced, interconnected and 
increasingly digital world of today's 
university students. 

More information than ever 
before is now at our fmgertips, and 
it is available instantly. Have a ques-
tion? Google it, and fmd the answer. 
Or, more likely, fmd 237,000 poten-
tial answers. Learning, previously 
confined to traditional instruction, 
is now taking place organically and 
incessantly, as knowledge expands 
with every news text alert, every e-
mail and every podcast. At the same 
time, nonacademic aspects of life are 
increasingly entering the classroom: 
Who hasn't forgotten to silence their 
cell phone once in a while or logged 
on to AIM during a lecture? 

If anything, though, today's stu· 
dents are not necessarily smarter. 
Digital resources have brought 
access to countless banks of knowl-
edge at low, if any, c!lst, but they 
have also made news and informa-
tion easier to organize and censor. 

As general readership of newspa-
pers quickly falls to the dominance 
of specialized Internet news sources 
(the college· age population gets 
more of its news from the Internet 
than any other group. according to 
polls from the Pew Research Center 
for the People and the Press), con· 
sumers have almost unlimited 
power to shape and cherry pick the 

news they consume. Indeed, it is 
easier today than ever to find only 
the news one wants to hear, without 
the rubbish that one does not. 

Even as Google competes against 
other Internet companies to digitize 
the libraries of world's universities, 
the role these collections play in the 
daily lives of students have changed. 
Indeed, so has the very nature of 
knowledge. 

In recent days, many headlines 
have made a ruckus over all~ed 
editing of Wikipedia entries by con-
gressional staffers for political gain: 
The lesson, familiar to most students, 
is that no knowledge is absolute. If 
each of the 237,000 Google results 
offer a slightly different answer, and 
if their ranking is determined by a

and every podcast. » 

mathematical algorithm, who can 
blame us for our cynicism about the 
world, and our opposition to the 
value systems - be they moral, cui· 
tural or literary - older generations 
attempt to impose on us? 

The lesson of the Information 
Age is that viewpoint colors the pre· 
sentation and framing o(knowledge. 
And based on comments posted on 
Ratemyprofessor.com, students are 
keen to this. "No matter what you 
do, it's wrong. if it's not his way; 
wrote one disgruntled student about 
a UCSD political science professor. 
No longer is "his way"-the only way, 
even if "he- is the world's expert on 
the subject. 

This healthy skepticism has not 
stopped at the university walls, 

either; in polls, college-age folk 
report less regard and trust for the 
mainstream media, and many more 
find themselves unsatisfied with the 
two major political parties. 

For the Facebook Generation, 
romance has gone digital, too. In 
high school, we used to pass notes 
during class . Now. we run home to 
check the "relationship status" of 
that cute girl or guy in our math 
class. Will they be "single;' "in a 
relationship" or the frustrating and 
ambiguous "it's complicated"? The 
ambitious can even ponder their 
potential compatibility by evaluat· 
ing posted music tastes and political 
leanings, all without the awkward· 
ness of that first date. 

Perhaps it won't be long before 
the "cancel relationship" option 
becomes the online proxy for break· 
ing up. 

As with any change, there will 
always be winners and losers -
and the losers are crying foul. In 
this case, they are major content 
providers who suddenly find their 
monopoly over information a thing 
of the past. For the music industry, 
which can no longer pad records 
with filler tracks, the answer has 
been lawsuits, including several 
dozen against UCSD students. For 
textbook manufacturers, who can 
no longer justify inflated prices in 
face of competition from their own 

, international editions, the answer 
has been bundling materials with 
costly junk and putting pressure on 
universities to limit Internet alterna-
tives, as seen in the current contro-
versy over eReserves. 

If past social revolutions are any 
guidance, they will not be success-
ful. 

It may be the Facebook 
Generation, but Facebook is sim-
ply an emblem of a bigger trend in 
the expansion of information and 
modes of communication. For those 
opposed to change because it is sim-
ply different - like, for example, 
when religious fundamentalists 
weep over the downfall of traditional 
"values" represented by Internet por-
nography - the subsequent changes 
in lifestyle may not be much to 
celebrate. But isn't there a Facebook 
group for people like that? 

For better or for worse, college 
students are living the avant-garde 
changes of tomorrow. These changes 
may be good, bad or - most likely 
- a little bit of both.

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 2006 THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINIONS 

. A Sort-oj Case for the N-Word Is Religious Flexibility 
Really That Desirable? By his defmition, Paul Dawson did not say the "N" word. The Louisville, Ken ., high 

school teacher believes he faced the 
longest suspension in the history of 
his school district not for using the 
word "nigger" to tell a student to sit 
down, but rather for using "nigga,» 
or in his favored spelling, "niggah" 
- "So as to emphasize the' ·ahh;" he 
painstakingly explained. 

The difference for Dawson is all 
in the usage. The UN" word ending 
in "_er" is a racial slur; the word 
he uses is still derogatory, but not 
unspeakably so -
the kind of word 
you'd toss out to a 
peer to make him 
pay attention. 

high school of 2,000, and barely 
more (I percent) at my public uni· 
versity of 20,000. While I do recog-
nize that this is a terrible lapse in my 
life experience, it is one on behalf of 
which I'm particularly upset at the 
powers that be. If you want to point 
fmgers at racists. let's look at the 
people who run this country. 

But racism probably had noth· 
ing to do with what Paul Dawson 
was suspended for. What he fail-
ingly attempted to argue in his trial 
by TV·news - the station's report 
held the teacher's testimony at arm's

length - was 
essentially that 
you can't have 
a taboo word 
if people say 
it all the time. 
One definition 

"Why is this 
word used so fre-
quently?" bemoans 
a dorky-sweatered

Dawson in a scolding session with 
a local TV station. He says he hears 
it from his black students all the 
time, and he says it like he's heard it 
all the time in the videoa interview, 
which you've probably seen on the 
Internet. 

It's been posted practicallyevery-
where, which makes me feel like I'm 
either saying something we all kind 
of agree with or about to commit 
social suicide as I hereby make a 
solemn confession: 

I kind of sympathize with Paul 
Dawson. 

A New Coinage 
It's not because I'm a racist. 

Believe me: As a fourth-year social 
science major - hell, an urban stud-
ies major - I'm far too learned to 
be a racist. But I am. despite my so-
called education, completely igno· 
rant when it comes to actual inter-
racial relations. I have neve.r had a 
black friend. There were approxi-
mately S black students in my entire 

sick: few people still use - is a slur, a 
taboo, a violence. But another one is 
a moderately deprecating pronoun 
for use in some casual situations. 

Many nonblack people - far 
more than this man's students, who 
he claims use it as frequently as 
"dude" or "hey man" - say it all 
the time. I hear it occasionally in 
passing groups around Price Center. 
Dawson offered some examples of 
the proper usage of the "slang ver-
sion" of the N·word: UNiggah this. 
Niggah please. Can a niggah get a 
pencil?" 

So the suspended teacher was 
right in a way: There is a new mean-
ing for the N-word. He just used it in 
an entirely inappropriate context. 

Old Words Somehow Still Hip 
This isn't the first originally 

offensive pronoun birthed in black 
culture that's been purloined by a 
much bigger group. White people 
- and also Asian and Mexican 
Americans - love to rip off the 

music, fashion and language of 
blacks to such a point that most 
of them don't even realize they're 
doing it anymore. Black culture has 
virtually defmed what is cool in the 
United States since the concept of 
"cool" was created by (black) jazz 
musicians sometime around the 
middle of last century. 

As each successive genera-
tion of black culture was absorbed 
into the mainstream, new words 
became "cool" to other (not just 
white) people. who basically want 
to seem like they were familiar with 
the cool things black people were up 
to. Pronoun usages of "cat," "dog," 
"fool," "bro;' and "bitch" go back fur-
ther than gangsta rap (and even 40s' 
jazz musicians) - and you prob-
ably still think they're "hip" (another 
theft). 

And while some blacks argue 
that the widespread hijacking of 
their culture by everyone else is 
a reason that this word, with its 
particularly derogatory connota-
tions, should be left to them alone, 
the widespread use of it has made 
that already a fantasy. It's adoption 
by the hip-hop community, with 
subsequent success in the mainest 
of the mainstream, virtually guar-
anteed the word would follow the 
same path as earlier pronouns black 
culture produced. 

Until today, the nearly unspoken 
rule of the N-word has presumably 
been that black people could use 
the N·word - because they're black 
- but no one else could. If a white 
person said it, it was grounds for 
believing or at least heartily suspect-
ing that they were a racist - you 
couldn't use the word without it 
meaning something highly de.roga-
tory. That is simply not true any 
more. 

Words are not only defined by

STAFF WRITER 

Darwin Day is a celebration of science, evolution and, of course, naturalist Charles 
Darwin's Feb. 12 birthday. It's usu· 
ally a favorite among atheist groups 
and college campuses, but this year, 
it has become something more. Meet 
"Evolution Sunday;' a compromise 
between science and Christianity. In 
a world where the common notion 
is that science and Christianity do 
not mesh, some believe that if the 
two could be made compatible, 
Christianity could regain the stub· 
born subset of the world lost to the 
authority of the scientific method. 

To this end, last Sunday select 
church leaders chose to give sermons 
that focused on the compatibility of 
scientific and theological ideas. "[This 
demonstrates I to the American public 
that the shrill fundamentalist voices 
that are demanding that people have 
to choose between religion and sci-
ence are simply wrong." said Michael 
Zimmerman, organizer of the event. 

Fundamentalists have not taken 
this quietly. Nor should they be expect. 
ed to. Combining the two concepts is 
odd at best, though it sounds nice. 
A Christian is taught that the Bible 
is truth, but evolution clearly depicts 
an ever-changing world that is com· 
pletely at odds with Genesis. Evolution 
is a picture of survival· dictated chaos, 
while Genesis speaks of control and 
design. The only reasons a church 
would choose to have both seems to 
be flexibility and mass appeal. 

Maintaining a popular front does 
help keep the morals of old alive. 
While Catholics have bishops, priests 
and the pope, Protestants have no 
such hierarchy. which is partly what 
makes them so adaptable. Without 

need for uniform suppon. churches 
can .speedily transform Darwin Day 
from the anti · theistic holiday it once 
was into an evangelical tool, merely 
by giving people the choice to have 
both. The rigors of traditional science 
cannot offer a similar claim in favor 
of religion. 

Mass marketing may not cheap-
en the anctity of religion, but it at 
least relegates it to the world of the . 
ordinary. Pastor Joel Osteen openly 
runs his Lakewood Church - one 
of the largest in the -eountry - like 
a business, patterning Sunday school 
after Disney World, and the building 
after an entertainment hall. 15 Disney 
and rock music your idea of eternal 
Truth? 

Flexibility has its price. Anyone 
who believes in the literal truth of the 
Bible would be at odds with Evolution 
Sunday. There has always been the 
duality of metaphor and literalism 
in the Bible, but drawing the line 
between the two is still a moot point. 
It's nice that a few hundred churches, 
out of the millions that abound in the 
country, chose to promote the middle 
road between science and theology, 
but religion is based on faith and 
trust. Why compromise? 

The result is an extension of the 
olive branch toward the sciences, but 
only a superficial one. It is only offered 
because some fear that the alternative 
is the preservation of literal Biblical 
truth to an alienating extent. 

In the end, Evolution Sunday is 
a break from the atheistic tradition. 
Survival instincts encouraged the 
attempt of a good-sized number of 
Christian churches to step away from 
the conservative stereotype and pave 
a more moderate image. But such 
churches are surely wondering, late at 
night, whether they've lost something 
of their soul along the way.

what they have meant. but also what 
they have come to mean. The way 
Dawson said he and his students usu-
ally use the N -word is far different 
from the uses that have made it such 
a particularly embittering slur, 

That was the crucial lapse in judg-
ment Dawson made: His students may 
use the slang word constantly, but, 
even if the student he was addressing 
had said it first, the context in which 
Dawson invoked it - telling the \>Oy 
to sit down - was a particularly mis-
construable one. The slur would have 
fit in too easily. 

PreeNIgah 
When Dawson claims that he 

"repeated the same insult because 
that's sort of what I've been trained 
to do.- it's a testament that should be 
familiar to those of us in the MTV 
generation. This word - the slang. 
not the slur - is in our vocabularies, 
from music, TV. films, the Internet or 
people we mow. We. are sometimes 
tempted to use it. 

To distinguish between people for 
whom it is socially acceptable to use 
the word exclusively because of their 
skin color, and people who may not 
for the same reason, goes against the 
fundamental spirit of the civil rights 
movement, rather than furthering it. 
Our generation was supposed to be 
brought up to know and act like racial 
equality was a foregone conclusion; 
the partial-taboo status of the N-word 
in the face of its current popularity 
directly contradicts that. If a black 
person can say a word that means 
"dude" or "man:' anyone should be 
able to. Otherwise, our social vocabu-
lary - what enables us to richly com-
municate with each other - is being 
cut off at the race line. 

to live according to what we all know 
- that people are fundamentally 
equal regardless of where they were 
born, what they look like, who they 
worship or who they love - that 
means fully coming to terms with 
the habits of our past (and present) 
that were not so wise, not running 
from them. 

Instead of sealing off the dark cor-
ners of our culture in taboo status for 
all but a select few to reconfigure, we 
all need to light them up and laugh 
at them and recycle their misery 
into something we can use. Wasn't 
that the Western argument about the 
Mohammed cartoons? That the hon-
esty of freedom of speech trumps the 
sensitivity of a relative few? 

Clearly, not in Dawson's case. 
After what seemed to have been a 

. severe tongue-lashing by both his 
bosses, Dawson was whimpering in 
defeat. "What kind of example are 
you setting if You use a word that you 
don't want them to use?- the reporter 
asked him. 

It was a silver bullet. Dawson 
failed to come up with the answer, 
which was: You use the words of your 
surroundings to communicate with it 
in ways you know it will understand . . 
He chose the wrong circumstance. 

But he did highlight the dangers 
of post-civil rights equality, of haul-
ing your stereotypes out (the ones 
about you and the ones you've got for 
others) and seeing them for all they're 
not worth by looking at where they 
came from (and not forgetting. even 
momentarily). 

LIST YOUR EVENT IN THE CAMPUS CALENDAR www.ucsdguardian.org I f we are really going to try, finally, 

Dawson was confused about this 
last point, but not completely wrong 
in pointing out a new usage for an 
old word, No other course makes 
sense than to acknowledge this as a 
new word and deal with it - however 
dangerous that appears to be.

Bulgakov Battles Censorship 
.In an AII-Too-Relevant Tale 

COURTESY OF UCSD THEATRE AND DANCE D EPARTMENT 
King qfKinga: Mikhail Bulgakov's "Moliere: A CAbal of Hypocrites" traces the French playwright's battle lVith censors 
- a topic the Russian author, writing under Soviet scrutiny, knew intimately. Teri Reeves (left) plays King Louis XIV. 

By Ania Dyltwslla 
SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

Censorship has been stifling artistic free-dom for centuries. Currently, the radio is strictly monitored with strategically 
inserted pauses, and the reverberations of that 
Janet Jackson Super Bowl fiasco still affect 
television (editing the Rolling Stones, that's 
just fucked up). At present, "Moliere: A Cabal 
of Hypocrites;' a play about the strict control of 
theater productions in the 17th century, seems 
quite fitting. In his work, Mikhail Bulgakov, 
whose own career was ruined by authorities 
who didn't appreciate his critical stance against 
the Soviet system, focuses on Moliere's ill-fated 
life and the restrictions put on his comedy 
"Tartuffe." 

Bulgakov's play captures the series of 
happy instances and unfortunate calamities 
of Moliere's life, and uncovers the detrimental 
role of bigoted critics, particularly the Bishop 
of Autun, who objected to Moliere's depic-
tion of a religious hypocrite in "Tartuffe." 
Although Moliere's life was anything but 
peachy, Bulgakov finds humor primarily by 
using commedia dell'arte stock situations 
and characters. Samuel Stricklen puts his 
proficiently timed wit to good use as the 
hilarious Barthelemy and Bouton, an actor in 
Moliere's troupe and the playwright's hench-
man, respectively, who assumes the traits of a 
typical. well-versed com media clown. 

Under Barbra Berloyitz's direction, the play 
retains a steady, engaging pace. The grand 
floor, columns, winding staircase and shifting 
movable furniture effectively represent both 
theking's grand court and the actor's backstage 

area. Lighting is used efficiently to supply omi-
nous shadows. During the confession scene, in 
which the Archbishop Charron.(Rufio Lerma) 
tries to get information from Moliere's former 
mistre.ss Madeleine Bejart (Amy Ellenberger), 
the use of sharp, dark-to-Iight contrast and 
candles is particularly potent. 

The cast deftly portrays their characters. 
Mark Smith is terrific as Moliere; his trans-
formation from a radiant, celebrated optimist 
to a miserable, disillusioned, ailing has-been 
is genUinely touching. Teri Reeves is perfectly 
domineering as King Louis XIV, bringing to 
the role both authority and an innate se.nse 
of merit. As Moirron, Walter Be1enky Suitably 
changes from a flirtatious, pompous provoca-
tew to an insignificant wretch; Lerma menac-
1ngiy channels Charron's wily ways and his 
unholy desire for revenge against Moliere; and 
Jennifer Chang, as the Honest Cobbler and 
King's jester, works as the compassionate voice 
of reason, fIDding just the right level of non-
syrupy sincerity. 

"Moliere: A Cabal of Hypocrites· is a tragi-
comedy that is at times moving and at other 
times quite humorous. It has an eclectic cast 
of characters: a king, an ass-kisser, a jester, a 
clown, a swordsman, a cult of clergymen and 
a troupe of actors. But above all, it provides 
an interesting (though disturbing) look at how 
easily artists' reputations can be destroyed 
when they veer too far away from familiar 
standards. 

"Moliere: A Cabal of Hypocrites· will play at 
the Mandell Weiss Forum from Feb. 23 to Feb. 
25 at 8 p.m. with a matinee showing at 2 p.m. 
on Feb. 25. For tickets or additional information, 
contact the box office at (858) 534-4574. 

Fox's Cheesy 'Free Ride' Is as Cliche as 
Living In Your Parents' Garage After College 
~ FREE RIDE, from page 9 

"Man vs. Beast." 
The fact that "Free Ride" is touting itself 

as a "partially improvised comedy" makes the 
show even more tragic because the writing is 
so devoid of aoy kind of humor that the actors 
are forced to revive it with their own. This 
becomes painfully obvious with the character 
of Mark Dove (Dave Sheridan), Nate's for -
mer classmate and booze hound who cruises 
around in his self-designed monster truck, 
much to Nate's awkward dismay. In Sheridan's 
desperate attempt to resuscitate a long coma-
tose script, he infuses his character with such 
an absurd, sophomoric personality (picture 
Keanu Reeves' Ted "Theodore" Logan with 
half the IQ and as much inhibition as a teen -
age girl during Mardi Gras) that he becomes a 
one-dimensional character for whom you feel 
more disgust and pity than actual amusement. 
Next to his explicit, raucous persona, all other 
characters eem to fade into oblivion, includ -
ing Nate. 

In fact, "sophomoric" seems to be the recur-
ring theme throughout a good portion of the 

sitcom. Nate's romantic pursuit of another for-
mer classmate and current bank teller Amber 
Danwood (Erin Cahill) is awkward and clumsy. 
Despite the fact that Amber is engaged (to a 
typical jerk), she still can't resist drawing atten -
tion to herself when the two aCcidentally bump 
into each other on their respective dates . Her 
obvious attempts to make him jealous, from 
sucking face with her fiance mere inches away 
from Nate to "aCcidentally" dancing right into 
him and his girl, are so innately juvenile that 
you 're transported back to junior high. You 
half expect them to begin passing notes to each 
other in the next episode with the scrawled 
message "Do you like me? Circle yes or no, or 
maybe:' 

If "Free Ride" had hoped to portray the 
comedic reality of life, it has failed miserably. 
Its jokes are nonexistent, its mind-numbing 
storyline is a basic cut-and -paste job taken 
from much more sophisticated shows and its 
characters range from ridiculous to borderline 
disturbing. If Fox wants romance, and absurd 
but "part ially improvised comedy," maybe it 
should stick with *Celebrity Love Island."

Another ftIm, perhaps especially 
significant to American audiences, 
is an II -minute look into the life 
of a mother whose army reserve 
unit is deployed to Iraq. The film, 
"One Weekend a Month," delves 
into the often-overlooked difficul-
ties of military motherhood, and 
the sacrifices women make daily to 
fulfill their simultaneous duties as 
mothers, women and human beings.

was written and directed by Eric 
Escobar, earned the honor of being 
named an official selection of the 
Sundance Film Festival as well as an 
official selection of the American 
Film Insitute at API Fest. 

The other ftIms consist of a jux-
taposition of light and serious selec-
tions, such as a cartoon documenta-
ry about senior-citizen dating by Liz 
Blazer, called "Backseat Bingo;" and 
a film about an Egyptian woman's 
struggle to choose her daughter's 
well-being over following the dic-
tates of her culture, called "Tahara," 
directed by Sarah Rashad. 

Of the eight, two seem most rel-
evant to UCSO's female population, 
including one about the daughter 
of Asian immigrants who struggles 
with her parents' high expecta-
tions, called "Perfection; directed 
by Karen Lin, and another called 
"Blessing,- in which a daughter 
attempts to deal with her overbear-

'Heart of Gold' Gives an Old Man His Due 
By Simone Wilson 

STAff WRITER 

Words Like "prairie" and "buffalo" mostly exit our vocabulary after third grade, when the "Little 
House on the Prairie" books get old 
and "Home on the Range" isn't so fun 
to sing anymore. Leave it to p1wnp-
ing wai1er Neil Young to revive them 
for us in log cabin rna-and-pa glory, 
hunched over Hank Williams' old gui-
tar with jowls drooping to the floor 
and an entire family of fellow fogey-
rockers to back him up. Who better 
to capture Young's fantasy bumpkin-
land than director Jonathan Demme, 
the genius behind the Talking Heads' 
supernatural 'SOs concert ·Stop 
Making Sense"? It's enough to make 
a.girl break out her old cassette p1ayer 
and do a doggone ditty. 

The opening of "Heart of Gold" 
- camcorder interviews with aging 
bandmates talking about Young's 
recent brain aneurism and other such 
middle-age-friendly topics - seems to 
signal a long. bumpy road ahead. But 
as soon as those thick country cur-
tains open to the S-' chords of an 
unforgettably hypnotizing voice. we're 
somewhere in a wheat field roc\tin' 
on ow daddy's knee, and everything's 
all right. Three gi.rIs in Western-style 
dresses lean in to harmonize, throw-
ing fiirty eyes at the man on the stool. 
Wide stage shots and lasting close-ups 
set the viewer centerstage in a trance, 
aware of every last hom and sym-
bol yet completely enveloped in their 
steady unity.

about the best old hound dog he ever 
did know. complete with snilBes and 
howls into the mic. But hey, if you're 
going to go there, go all the way! 

And, of cowse, it wouldn't be a 
Young concert without a few classics. 
Aside from trading in his scraggly 
burn look for a slightly more cusb-
ioned. country gentleman one, Young 
hasn't lost an ounce of the charisma 
or voice (nor the werewolfish I-just-
smelled-something-terrible sneer) 
that made him a legend. Close your 
eyes and you might as well be back 
in the 70s, swaying in the love crowd 
to "Heart of Gold" and "Old Man," 

except this time we get anecdotal 
punch lines in between. 

Demme succeeds with "Heart 
of Gold" for the same reaiOnS he 
did with the Talking Heads. The 
concert audience might as well be 
absent save for some applause, and we 
become completely entangled in the 
on-stage interactions and enraptur-
ing musical contributions (including 
the Nashville String Machine, piano 
from Spooner Oldham, and vocals 
from wife Pegi Young and the Fisk 
University Singers). A broom sweeps 
across a mat for the swishing rhytlun 
of "Harvest Moon; taking us back to 
the simple brilliance of David Byrne 
tapping his foot to a small stereo 
beside him for the opening scene of 
"Stop Making Sense." 

Young wonders what Hank 
Williams would have thought had 
he seen the Gaylord Entertainment 
Center in Nashville on his way out 
of Tootsie's Orchid Lounge. "But 
the spirit's still here, and that's what 
counts:' he said. And whether or 
not anybody else does, it's apparent 
Young's still got the spirit.

Belle & Sebastian 
• The Life Pursuit 
MATADOR 

**** 

Once the favorite stuffed toy of the mopey, dopey gentlefolk, Scotland's Belle and Sebastian were, at their most energetic, a soundtrack for skipping 
along the lane, and at their least energetic, old sad bas-
tard music (according to Jack Black in "High Fidelity") . 
With The Life Pursuit, the band seems to be traveling 
backward in time through their influences, highlight-
ing the era of A.M. pop with glassy organs, infectious 
melodies, sticky-sweet harmonies and guitars mor·~ 
jangly than ever. 

The piano lead· in of the opener recalls Sergio 
Mendes and his pop·samba group, Brasil '66, which is 
no coincidence - Pursuit is a pastel-hued tribute to 
lazy sunny days (see "Another Su.nnyDay," a Byrdsesque 
tale of blossoming love and unaVOidably fun adventures, 

Art Brut 
• Balli Bani Rock & Roll 
FIERCE PAHOA 

Stop buying your albums at the supermarket. They only sell records that have charted, and Art Brut, well, we've only just started; stammers Eddie Argos on 
"Formed a Band; the first single from Art Brut's genius 
mockery of a debut, Bang Bang Rock 'n' Roll. That hello 
could be the anthem of any indie rock band in the world, 
but only these Londoners have the unassuming wit to lay 
it out there as if arrogance wasn't a staple ingredient of 
rock. Considered with their highly suggestive name - a 
hip coinage for "outsider art," works by artists who lack 
formal training - and after the first verse, they've peacti-
cally already admitted they suck. 

That hilarious humility is their top offering: Vocalist 
Argos points his dry, brutally (forgive the pun) sarcastic 
British chatter at every trite rock 'n' roll subject - good 

Arctic Monkeys 
• Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not 
DOMINO 

T be Arctic Monkeys conjure an image of the pristine, silver snow of the North Pole, where white, carefree monkeys frolick about before they are snatched and 
immediately devoured by the Abominable Snowman. 
This oh-so-cute scene is as iU -fitt ing as the band's deci-
sion to pair Alex Turner's weak voice with Matthew "The 
Cat" Helders' overpowering drums. It would be the same 
as featuring Chris Martin from Coldplay in a Metallica 
song; it simply doesn' t work. For this reason, 'furner's 
voice sounds more whiny than actually audible. 

Their debut, Whatever People Say I Am, That 's What 
I'm Not, is surely a deceptively roekin' album - until one 
realizes the only rhythm comes from the throbbing beat of 
the drums. When a song has the same up and up banging 
drums going on with few breaks, the music turns into a 
numbing background. Just when Turner finds the right 

- in the sun, of course). Stuart Murdoch's lyrics are, as 
always, clever and endearing. and 0.0 the tracks where 
he takes over the lead vocals, his Glaswegian accent 
and heartfelt singing create instant classics - even if 
they sound like your favorite B&S song already. There 
are a few dull moments on the album, which feel a bit 
like shutting the blinds on a perfectly sunny day, but the 
quality tracks quickly make the album a memorable one. 
Compared to the cooped-up wintery beauty of their 
early albums, The Life Pursuit isn't nearly as precious, 
but it lifts the fog shrouding the mopes and the dopes, 
preaching a new gospel: It's a nice day. You should go 
out and enjoy it.

HIATUS EDITOR 

weekends, bad weekends, fighting with girls and moving 
to L.A. - all over straightforward punk. rock poppers. 
Think Jonathan Richman's ironic confessionals over-the 
gritty new-wave apparatus of the Fall . 

The novelty could be cheap, but Argos' verses strike 
near profound when loaded with his own cutely weird 
obsessions (pop stardom, modern art, Morrissey), ele-
vating them above mere parody - an insightfully 
retarded social and artistic -commentary. But if Argos 
really is so bent on getting on Top of the Pops (which 
might also mean the supermarket), he' might for once 
need to take seriously his own nonsense: "No more 
songs about sex and drugs and rock 'n' roll; it's boring."

SENIOR.STAFF WRITER 

melody k> compliment his strident voice, the songs are 
truncated to the mere 2-minute range. Jamie "Cookie" 
Cook's backing vocals might as well' take center stage to 
save Throer from embarrassing himself. The painful truth 
is, the first half of their album follows this same droning 
formula . 

Lucltily, the rest of the album avoids this fate. After a 
quiet interlude, the Monkeys get down to knocking the 
Libertines and Franz Ferdinand off of their respective 
pedestals. Though the second half is more appealin&, 
when the entire album is taken together, the result is still 
tiresome. Despite its rave reviews by the British press 
and its status as the fastest -selling UK debut record of 
all time, it doesn't quite live up to the hype.

After that, I knew I could just do the

Even though snowboarding is 
one of the few positives in these 
Winter Games, it will be a couple 
more Olympics until it becomes the 
premiere event. And when it does, 
everyone will be watching.

points might have led lOme to ~ 
that the young Triton team wasn't

said. ·Coach Carr is a different kind

they've already beat and a regular 
season fmale against Sonoma State 
that could be monumental for the 
program. 

"We just want to go 4-0, finish 
strong and hopefully get that spot in 
the playoffs; Patterson said. 

That scenario might have seemed 
very distant to the 6-foot-5-inch for-
ward a year ago when he At out the 
season to focus on academics. 

"I like to take credit for push· 
ing him toward playing again." said 
Hatch, one of Patterson's closest 
friends who called the forward "our 
main offensive weapon." 

Patterson, now a Triton star, 
almost stayed off the hardwood 
before Hatch convinced him. 

·When I was scheduling my 
classes I felt as if [itl was too much; 
Patterson said. "Basketball just 
seemed like something extra that I 
didn't need at the time. I returned 
because I really missed the competi-
tive atmosphere and the camaraderie 
formed between teammates: 

While Patterson gets more min-
utes and accolades than his counter-
parts, Poppen and Lawlor's versatil-

ity have helped to make UCSD a 
complete package. 

"Shane has brought some much-
needed athleticism and Darryl is a 
guy who can play both outside and 
inside," Odiye said. 

"I don't really like a particular 
part of my game more than any 
other," Lawlor said. · 1 think I'm a 

. pretty well-rounded player: 
Lawlor's well -rounded game 

meshes weB with Poppen's style of 
play. 

"I love to use my jumping ability 
to grab offensive rebounds." Poppen 
said. The player now known as 
"Shooter Shane" admitted he "likes 
to shoot a Uttle bit too.-

Porpen's sharp shooting coupled 
with Patterson and Lawlor's agres-
sive play has led to this lIistoric 
season. 

The impressive year for these 
three freshmen and the rest of the 
Triton men's basketball team contin-
ues this weekend as it travels to take 
on Cal Poly Pomona and Cal State 
Dominguez Hills, before returning 
to RIMAC for the final homestand 
of the seuon. While they focus on 
the end of thi& season, it's also evi-
dent that the magic this year can 
continue in years to come. 

"The potential this team has for 
success is limitless," Patterson said . 
"We are capable of doing something 
very special for this program.·

Winter Olympic Games 
Can't Fuel Fan Interest 
The Winter Olympics are here. The Winter Olympics are here. The 20th Winter 
Olympics are being held in Turin, 
Italy. Did you know? Of course you 
did, but do you care? 

Don't you want to see figure 
skater Michelle Kwan go out as an 
Olympic champion on her third and 
final try? 

How about watching bad -boy 
skier Bode Miller back up his words 
and quiet his critics by winning sev-
eral gold medals? 

Maybe you want to see the popu -
lar American speed skater Apolo 

the media and fans put too much 
pressure on him to.succeed and that 
he shouldn't have to try if he doesn't 
want to do so. 

American figure skater Johnny 
Weir blamed his bad performance 
on a late bus schedule, saying that 
his aura was disturbed and that he 
felt "black" inside. 

We have even seen U.S. snow-
boarder Lindsey Jacobellis, ahead 
by a mile and two jumps away from 
winni ng the gold in the snowboard 
cross, do a hot-dogging grab, only to 
fall and come in second. 

Having said all this, there has 
Anton Ohno

City games four 
years ago against

Well, none of these things hap-

pened in these winter games. 
Kwan dropped out of the Turin 

games (or, as NBC likes to use, 
Torino games) after re-inj uring her 
groin during practice. 

Miller has skied downhill, com-
bined, super-g and giant slalom, but 
has yet to win a single medal with 
only one event (the slalom) left. 

Even though Ohno managed to 
get a bronze medal in the 1,000-
meters, he failed to defend his crown 
at the I ,SOO-meters, eating shit in 
the semifinals. 

T here are no more big stars and 
no more big story lines. No won-
der the ratings are low; this is no 
"American Idol." 

The way I look at it, the Summer 
Olympics are like a competition for 
football players: the quarterbacks, 
running backs, wide receivers, line-
backers, linemen and so on, while 
the Winter Olympics are the games 
for the kickers. 

I'm not saying that the Winter 
Olympians are not athletes, or that 
they don't train hard - but figure 
skaters are no gymnasts, speed skat-
ers and skiers are no track stars and 
hockey players are no basketball 
players. 

So far, along with disappoint-
ments, there have heen a lot of 
excuses. Miller has told the Italian 
press that he didn't care about win-
ning. He also complained about how 

the 1998 Winter Games, hut since 
then, it has continued to gain popu-
larity every year. 

Snowboarders Shaun White and 
Hannah Teter dominated the half-
pipe, both winning gold for America 
and enjoying every moment of it. 

Teter is a breath of fresh air -
she is an easygoing, goofy girl who 
lists one of her favorite hobbies as 
making syrup out of sap from trees 
in her native Vermont. 

After locking up the gold medal 
with her first run, she pushed even 
harder to improve that score on her 
"victory lap." 

"I just kind of felt the same 
standing up there," Teter said. "It's 
like, 'Here we go again, another run 
on the pipe - but at the Olympics: 
I just felt super positive." 

She also snuck off about 20 min-
utes before her practice run with 
her U.S. teammate Gretchen Bleiler, 
who fmished second to Teter, to get 
some fresh powder. 

These two women went snow-
boarding before they had to com-
pete in the half-pipe finals . That is 
pure love. 

On the men's side, San Diego 
native White - commonly known 
as "The Flying Tomato" - became 
a household name. He is just a 19-
year-old kid who clearly owns his 
sport, but manages to stay hum-

Young Talent Ignites Triton Fury 
Freshmen trifecta of 
Lawlor, Patterson and 
Poppen push men's 
basketball program 
to new heights. 

By Joe T evel~wltz 
SENIO R STAFF WRITER 

The Triton men's basketball 
program is in the midst of its most 
successful season since moving to -
NCAA Division II in 2000. The -
eason began with new faces out-

numbering returning players and, 
de pite the lack of experience, the 
team broke the UCSD D-II records 
for wins in a season, conference 
victor ies, and, now, having won 
four-straight games, are heading 
into the final weeks of the ~eason 
with the longest winning streak in 
eight years. 

Propelling the Tri ton tide is a 
very deep squad wi th nine play-
ers averaging at least 10 minutes a 
game. Three of those players, for-
wards Henry Patterson and Darryl 
Lawlor, and guard Shane Poppen, 
are freshmen who have played in 
all 2S games this year. 

Patterson, the current California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
Player of the Week, leads the team 
with 13.4 points per game and tops 
the CCAA in field -goal percentage, 
making 59 percent of his shots. 

Lawlor has proven extremely 
versatile from the forward position, 
averaging 6.6 points, 2.6 rebounds 
and one assist per game while con-
verting a team-high 45.5 percent of 
his three-point attempts. 

Poppen is the team's fourth-
leading scorer with 7.3 points per 
game and has been particularly 
clutch as ofiate, with four points in 
the flOal two minutes of a win over 
Cal State Stanislaus and the win-
ning layup against Cal State San 
Bernardino, helping UCSD defeat 
the six-time defending CCAA 
champions for the first time since 
moving up to Division II. 

In fact, without the clutch play 
of the triumvirate, the Tritons 
might not have recovered from a 
2-7 start to reach third place in 
CCAA standings this late in the 
season. 

"Basketball is all about pres-
sure," said Poppen, the 6-foot-4-
inch guard from Thousand Oaks.

Toreros Cool Triton Softball's Hot Start In Sweep of Doubleheader 
UCSD drops last two 
games in Arizona 
tournament, then 
returns home to lose 
two more to USD. 

By Lauren Kato 
STAff WRITER 

After returning home from the 
Schutt Sports Leadoff Classic with 
losses in their last two tournament 
games, the UCSD women's softball 
team continued its· struggles with two 
blowout losses to crosstown rival the 
University of San Diego on Feb. 22. 

The Tritons (9-6) took an early 
4- 1 lead in their first game against 
the Toreros (6-3), but could not quiet 
USD's loud bats in the late innings. 
The Toreros rallied from a 4-2 deficit 
after three innings with 14 runs in the 
next three, including a nine-run sixth 
inning that put the Tritons behind 16-7 
and eventually ended the game on the 
mercy rule by the same score. 

UCSD did not fare much better 
in the latter of the two games, falling 
behind 4-1 after thrft inninp, and 

never getting the offensive rally going it 
needed to overcome the deficit. While 
the Triton offense sputtered, USD put 
together a three-run fourth inning and 
a five-run seventh inning to cement 
their lead and a 12-2 victory. 

The sweep, USn's first over UCSD 
since the Tritons moved up to Division-
II in 2000-01, came just days after the 
softball team returned from Arizona 
after winning its first thne games, then 
losing its next two. 

A strong weekend by the team 
came to an end Feb. 19 with an 
11-4 loss to Cal State Dominguez 
Hills on the final day of the tour-
nament. The Tritons left the three-
day tournamentwith a tournament 
record of 3-2. The team boasted 
wins over Regis University, Western 
New Mexico University and Texas 
Woman's University, before 
dropping games to 
No. 12 Emporia 
State, University of 
Kansas and Cal State 
Dominguez Hills. The 
results of the tournament bring the 
team to 9-4 for the year. 

The Mons brtezed put the com-
petition in their first game on Feb. 16, 

handing a 3-2 loss to RegiS. 
Sophomore pitching sensation 

Melissa Ward improved to a stagger-
ing 5-0 on the season after throwing 
her fifth complete game against Regis. 
Clutch hits from fellow sopho-
more infielder Elizabeth 
Vasquez, who went 3-for-
4, and senior outfielder 
Jenny Spence~ who 
added two hits, aided 
Ward offensively. 

In the second 
game, UCSD tal-
lied another vic-
tory over Western 
New Mexico, 5-3. 
Sophomore second 
baseman Jenny 
Maze and junior 
third base-
man Dallas 
Hernandez 
e a c h 
muscled 
out home 
run s 
in the 
effort. 
Maze's 
Ion g 

ball was a two-run shot 
while Hernandez's 

first career clinger 
was a solo homer. 

Sophomore 
pitcher Nicole 
Fullerton tossed 

her second com-
plete game of the sea-

son and improved her 
record to 2-1. 

The Tritons 
returned to action on 
Feb. 17 against Texas 
Woman's Univenity. 
The win came easily 
to the Tritons, who 

beat the 

opposition 4-1. 
Ward pitched a full seven innings 

in the contest, logging three strike-
outs and bringing her to 6-0. Ward 
received run support from senior 
shortstop Desiree Franciscus, who 
knocked home Spencer, and Vasquez, 
who knocked out a solo shot. Maze 
joined in with a two-run home run 
that provided insurance for the Tritons 
in the win. 

The victory gave the Tritons a 3-0 
record by the end of the second day 
of ~tion, sending them into the 
gold bracket of the tournament. 

UCSD next faced off against No. 12
