CALPIRG study backs 
direct loans in campus aid 

By CHRlmNE CLARK 
Senior Staff Writer 

Ca lifornia college students 
could receive up to $246 million in 
new financial aid and UCSD could 
find up to an additional $4 million 
through proposed changes to the 
way the federal government admin-
isters its student loans, according to 
a new report released by California 
Public Interest Research Group's 
Higher Education Project and the 
American Association of Collegiate 
Registrars. 

The report backs the Student 

Aid Reward Act, new federal legis-
lation that proposes to discontin-
ue the Federal Family Education 
Loan program, which pays pri-
vate lend ers to provide loans, 
and replace it with a Direct Loan 
Program, through which the gov-
ernment loans money directly to 
students. 

"The only difference [between 
the programs) is that under the 
Direct Loan Program, the govern-
ment lends directly to the students, 
while under FFEL, the govern-

Budget proposal includes' cuts 
College councils would lose funds under plan 

By CHARLES NGUYEN 
Senior Staff Writer 

A.S. President Christopher 
Sweeten has proposed across-the-
board cuts to student organization 
and college councils as pan of an 
effort to close a budget gap in initial 
talks over next year's budget. 

"We have very little money 
available to work with, so we 
are all having to take cuts," Vice 
President Finance Greg Murphy 
said. "This includes our stipends, 
our services, our outreach pro-
grams and even our student orga-
nizations, unfortunately. We only 
have a certa in amount of money 
to work with so we need to set our 
priorities fairly. " 

T he budget'S revenue projec-
tion will likely force m.ultiple cuts 
because of a significantly smaller 
amount carried forward from the 
current year's operations, accord-
ing to Murphy. The carry f, rward 
amount is down 74,500, or 42 
percent, from the budget approved 
last spring. Part of the decrease is 
the result of I w profi ts by srudent-
run businesses managed by the

csu, graduate 

students reach deal 
Averting a strike that threatened 

to disrupt classes and delay grading. 
the Califomia State University ana 
the union representing its graduate 
students announced that they had 
reached a tentative agreement just 
hours before a labor stoppage was 
set to beRino 

In a Short and cryptic statement 
released just minutes after midnight 
on May 12 - the d"Y of the planned 
strike - the union told the media' that 
the dispute had been averted. 

'We are very pleased that we 
have reached an agreement for the 
first contract with the [union)." CSU 
Assistant Vice Chancellor for Human 
Resources Sam Strafaci stated in a 
joint press release issued by the 
union and university later in the day. 
"Initial contract bargaining is often 
very difficult, and the agreement is an 
indication that the parties took their 
work seriouslt 

Strafaci said both parties were 
"willing to be creative" and find com-
promise on a three-year contract 
for the university's 6,000 student 
employees. 

Previously, the university had not 
recognized the right of graduate stu-
dents to be organized by the United 
Auto Workers, the union that repre-
sents graduate students across the 
country. 

'This is an historic agreement 
for academic student employees at 
CSU: the union's bargaining com-
mittee member and San Diego State 
University teaching assistant Raymond 
Wight stated in the release.

Kansas urxed to 
in dude evolution study 

Phil Skell, a member of the presti-
gious National Academy of Sciences, 
has jumped into the debate over 
what role evolution should play in 
state education curriculum in Kansas. 
The state made national headlines 
several years ago after its Board of 
Education deleted most references to 
the Darwinian theory. 

Ea~ier this month, the board held 
hearings to ~mine whether the 
theory should be included in the 
state's education guidelines, though 
scientists who said the hearings were 
rigged in favor of critics of evolution 
largely boycotted them. 

In a letter to the board, Skell 
urged it to include favorable evidence 
supporting evolutionar'f. theory in con-
junction with ~s scientific criticisms. 

Bill would extend 
loan forgiveness 

Rep. John Kline (R-Minn.) has intro-
duced a congressional bill that would 
extend an expiring program that pro-
vides student-loan relief for mihtary 
reservists called up to actM! duty. 

Ori~nally approved in 2003 by a 
wide bIpartisan margin, the provisions 
of the law allow the U.s. Department 
of Education to provide assistance to 
active troops. The provisions are set to 
expire at the end of September. 

The bill would extend the authority 
for the education secretary to issue 
waivers excusing ma~ary personnel 
from their federal student~oan repay-
ment obligations. 

The 2003 law also asked colleges 
to refund tuition and fees of students 
v.OO were called away for duty in the 
middle of a school session and to mini-
mize requirements for reapplication. 

Scholarship fraud 
complaints on rise 
The number of complaints and 

inquiries into potentially fraudulent 
scholarships and grants dimbed to 
4,486 in 2004, up Trom 670 the year 
before, the Federal Trade Commission 
announced in a new report 

Thou~h the numbers could indi-
cate an Increase in scholarship fraud, 
the report suggested that the spike 
might insteadtlave been caused by 
more vigilant enforcement by govem-
ment agencies. 

Most recent trends indicate that 
fraudulent activity has shifted from 
schoIarship-search services to finan-
cial-aid consulting services.

Loan: Lenders dispute numbers used in study Fest: Alumni Association 
held second Junkyard Derby continued from page I 

ment subsidizes loan companies to 
lend to students," Interim Revelle 
College Freshman Senator Ted 
M cCombs, who co-released the 
study with the campus' CALPIRG 
chapter, stated in an e-mail. "The 
result is, wi th all its bureaucra-
cy and subsidies and guarantees, 
FFEL costs the government about 
12 times, on average, [more than] 
direct loans." 

Under the S.T.A.R. Act, the 
federal government would use the 
savings to provide a $3 billion 
increase in aid to students who are 
already e1igi ble for Pell Grants 
or to needy graduate students, 
according CALPIRG Higher 
Education Advocate Merriah 
Fairchild . 

Currently, universities are 
allowed to choose which program 
they use to provide loans to stu-
dents. UCSD, for example, con-
tinues to use FFEL, though the 
act would provide financial incen-
tive to universities that switch to 
direct loans. 

CALPIRG campus organizer 
Kirsten Schatz said that UCSD 
stands to earn up to $4 million 
more in aid if it adopts ~he Direct 
Loan Program, and San Diego 
State Univer ity could also receive 
an additional $5 million. 

"This $3 billion increase would 
be enough to give each Pell Grant 
recipient almost $600 more in 
additional grant aid a year, which 
is six times the proposed increase 
in the Pell Grant maximum for 
next year in the federal budget," 
the report stated. 

However, UCSD Financial Aid 

Director Vince De Anda said that 
the findings in the report might be 
maccurate. 

"It is pretty much wishful 
thinking," De Anda said. "The 
analysis they used for estimating 
the savings is faulty. We don't 
know whether it will produce $4 
million [for UCSD] and if that 
money will go to financial aid." 

De Anda said that he recom-
mended FFEL over the Direct 
Loan Program. 

" I think the PIRG report 
underestimates the cost 
of direct lending ... " 

- Peter Wanen, spokesmIn. 
Education Finance CcuIc:iJ 

"I think students get better 
service through the FFEL pro-
gram because there is a lot of price 
competition between many lend-
ers," De Anda said. "Now [FFEL 
loans] are getting better rates than 
direct loans. Students have a lot of 
choices between lenders [through 
FFEL Loansl- you only get one 
choice with direc t loans." 

In add ition, a separate report 
sponsored by lending companies 
earlier this year challenged the 
federal government data used in 
the CALP1RG srudy. 

Peter Warren, a spokesman 
for the student-lender association 
Education Finance Council, which 
co-sponsored the report, said that 

the CALPIRG study was inaccu-
rate because it undershot the cost 
of the Direct Loan Program. 

"I think the PIRG report 
underestimates the COSt of direct 
lending, and it therefore contains 
a crucial bias," Warren stated in 
an e-mail. ·Several of the fac-
tors that the direct loan scoring 
does llot include are administra-
tive costs, reasonable interest-
rate scenarios and the tax loss to 
the [federal) treasury that would 
result if the guaranteed student-
loan portfolio was transferred to 
direct lending." 

The lender's report stated 
that the comparison between the 
Direct Loan and FFEL programs 
was inconclusive because it does 
not accurately project the rela-
tionship between long-term and 
short-term interest rates. 

However, the CALPIRG report 
states that the Direct Loan Program 
is more beneficial to students based 
on the subsidy rates provided by 
President George W. Bushs budget 
proposal for next year. 

Schatz said CALPIRG released 
the report to encourage legislators 
from San Diego County to sup-
port the new legislation backing 
direct loans. 

"Itissom.ethingthatCALPLRG 
has been working on - endorsing 
the S.T.A.R. Act," Schatz said. 
"We have been calling on legisla-
tors for support, but we have a 
couple in the area who haven't 
endorsed it, and we hope they will 
decide in [its) favor."

patrolled in plain-clothes, issuing 
tickets for drinking, and in response 
to after-the-fact complaints last year, 
the police also brought out a team 
of volunteers to monitor parts of the 
campus for trouble. 

Several students reported see-
ing a matronly looking woman near 
Cafe Ventanas wearing a formal 
dress. Though initially confused by 
students as someone's grandmother, 
the woman was also armed with

Change in class retake policy would not be 
conducive to learning or better study habits 
By ROBIN MARIE AVERBECK 

Staff Writer 

M any students are familiar wi th the experience of a dismally low grade - the 
sigh of resignation coupled with 
the mild but important comfort 
that the course will simply have to 
be retaken. As frustrating as such 
moments are, the academic hiccups 
that are common to most of us are 
usually smoothed over by the exis-
tence of ~ second chance. However, 
this may not remain so. The UCSD 
Academic Senate's Committee on 
Education Policy is considering a 
rule change that would prevent 
students who take a course twice 
from repl acing their original 0 or 
F grade with a second, presumably 
better, grade. Students could still 
retake the course and earn a new 
grade - but the GPA-Iowering 
effect of the original 0 or F would 
remain on the transcript. 

T he justification for this pol-
icy is to prevent grade inflation. 
GPAs appear to be on the rise, 
and therefore the true measuring 
stick of academic performance is 
off-kil ter. But whether this is a suf-
fici ent elCcuse for the new policy, 
and whether the policy will even 
help amend the situation, is anoth-
er question entirely. 

At first glance, the rule seems 
to be consistent with a philosophi-
cal point of view. Universities are 
su pposed to prepare us for the 
"real world" - indeed, sometimes 
they even claim to be a part of 
it - and in the real world one 
is judged and rewarded based on 
performance. No second chances, 
no retakes. Having such a policy 
could , theoretically, give reward 
where more reward is due, grant-
ing those students who are consis-
tently diligent with their studies a 
quantifiable edge over those .who 
are not. 

However, the real world is 
hardly theoretical. There are 
many second, and sometimes 
third chances in the perilous "real 
world." People obtain connections 
and fri endships that give them 
room to slip up here and there, 
burea ucratic rules laid down by 
the government make it exceed-
ingly hard to be fired in certain 
professions, and the standards Out 
there are si mply less demanding 
than pulling off a four-year educa-
tion with never a less-than-stellar 

grade . It seems cold. to require 
understanda bly overstressed, over-
worked and regrettably imperfect 
students to wallow in their one- or 
two-time potholes. 

Furthermore, it is dubious 
whether the proposed policy would 
even lower grade inflation. As Vice 
President of Academic Mfairs 
Harry Khanna points out, the new 
policy would provide grade-point 
justice not for those who mess up, 
but for those who are already doing 
decently well anyway. 

"In my opinion, the student who 
gets an F or a 0 in the beginning of 
their college career is not really the 
benefi ciary of the grade inflation 
- it's more the person on that B to 
A range," Khanna stated. 

It is often students just entering 
college as freshmen or community-
college transfers who suffer the 
plight of the D or F. Most students 
have some discomfiture adjusting, 
and it seems unreasonable that 
the rest of their academic careers 
should be hampered by such grow-
ing pains. 

Of course, students would still 
be allowed to retake the course, 
and therefore at least moderate the 
effect of their low grades - but 
they could not obliterate them. [n 
addition, there already is, and still 
would be, a restriction on how 
many courses students can retake 
- 16 units is the limit. This pro-
tection already seems like enough 
to prevent serious abuse by stu-
dents who are career slackers. 

One thing is for certain: Such 
a reality would strike fear into the 
hearts of many a student. How 
many of us have been saved by the 
ability to retake? Things do happen 
in life, and a particularly stressful, 
busy quarter, a personal trauma 
or even physical illness could spell 
the difference between Ivy League 
graduate schools and mediocre 
ones, high-position jobs and entry-
level ones, if such experiences left 
permanent damage on a GPA. 

For example, JUSt because a stu-
dent struggles with metabolic bio-
chemistry does not mean that he 
or she should be disqualified from 
graduate school , especially if they 
did well when they retook the chal-
lenging courses. 

Ultimately, it is questionable 
whether it is even in the university's 
interest to enact such a policy. The 
long-term result could do little to 
amend grade inflation but a lot to

FIRST TIME? SON, DO YOU EVEN HAVE THE SLIGHTEST 

IDEA HOW MANY TIMES I HAD TO SWITCH MAJORS 
BECAUSE I KEPT GETTING D'S IN MY CORE CLASSES?*' 

diminish the prestige and reputation 
of the university and its products. 

Although some may argue that 
fairness and real-world conditions 
justify such a policy, ultimately it 

will help no one, and its reasoning 
is not nearly enough of a justifica-
tion for the headache and trouble it 
will cause for students. Universities 
want their students to do well, 

Ben 10000no/Guordion 
yet creating an environment where 
being superhuman is a requirement 
will only decrease the quality and 
enjoyment of the academic experi-
ence. 

Individualism is grand, but society still needs interaction / 
Don It forget 
the joker 

Cody Nabours 

We Americans glutton-ously binge upon many things: food , fast food, 
cheap beer, expensive (but not real-
ly) gasoline, bad movies, terrible 
music, worse television; but this is 
all old news. Our most rapturous 
and destructive craving, however, 
is our notion of individuality. It 
has become so simple and status 
quo to experience nearly every-
thing cultural on a personal level, 
like listening to iPod music in those 
ubiquitous ear-buds that seal off 
one fifth - which, coincidentally, 
is how much vodka my roommate's 

girlfriend drank on Sun God - of 
the senses, or like watching a DVD 
sitting on a semen-and-mustard-
stained couch in the privacy of 
one's home. We have lately come to 
embrace the individual perspective 
as the dominant point of view at 
all times, in any situation, regard-
ing all things, assured that if we all 
care only about "me and mine," the 
world will run smoothly. This per-
spective, though it speaks for the 
"every-person-is-unique" stand-
point of the PC generation from 
which we rise, forgets one impor-
tant thing: exr.\aimed by George 
Costanza, the paragon of reason, 
"We live in a society!" 

If there is one common template 
connecting all the classes, lectures, 
and shit-reading I've done in recent 
years, it is this: First, someone 
comes up with a brilliant, revolu-
tionizing theory regarding some-

thing; then, the theory is subse-
quently disproved by someone else, 
who said the exact opposite thing; 
then, in recent years, experts in the 
field, bitterly divided over which 
theory is correct, find with their 
mighty science that the answer is 
a combination of the two. (My 
roommate tells me this is called the 
dialectic, corning from Hegel, and 
I believe him.) This "dialectic," 
applied to our unshakable worship 
of the individual, tells us that the 
best path to take is not one that 
places tlle most nlue upon the 
individual, nor is it one that places 
the most value upon the greater 
aggregate of society. The answer, as 
always, is two-faced, where society 
enriches the individual, and the 
individual enriches society. 

We all must integrate ourselves 
into the group; it is only natural 
and surely inevitable. The problem, 

in our individualistically consumed 
society, is that our connection to the 
group (pop culture) is through the 
hegemony of television, mass (and 
local) media, blockbuster movies, 
Clear Channel radio and advertise-
ments, aU supplied by the group-
think of those pesky corporations, 
tailored for our witless whims. 
In an effort to give us what they 
think we want, they have created 
a culture that delivers only instant 
gratification, the logical demand 
of our collective egotism. The nst 
majority of individuals will choose 
instant gratification over some-
thing possibly more rewarding,like 
choosing a box of Ha-Ho's over a 
home-cooked meal from an unfa-
miliar recipe. We use the group to 
guide ~ach individual toward n_ 
ideas, experiences and culture, but 
when the group is the magistracy 
of the corporate salesman, all they 

will give us is what they believe 
we want, more of the same. The 
group that we connect ourselves 
to should not be the hand-me-
downs from the committee, but 
the discourse between individuals 
in the group, where each member 
is willing and able to instruct the 
others, and each member has some-
thing to learn. Yes, we are a society 
- indeed made up of individuals 
- and so our collective cuI ture 
should consist of more than our 
mutual agreement over the lifestyle 
handed down to us by advertisers 
and the media groups under their 
dominion. . 

The individual, mind you, is 
extraordinarily imporunt. Our 
culture affects us personally, and 
through the choices we make, the 
desires we feed and the things we

opinions based on half-heard facts. 
Knowledge, like culture, can only 
be cultivated individually, but like 
culture, is meaningless unless it is 
shared. 

The entertainment industry, 
deep in the pockets of advertisers, 
does not understand this idea of 
how knowledge should be shared ;

people what they

of real people will

to teach, learn and 
progress, and can 
only come from 
our respect of the 
individual as well 
as our respect for 
the society made 
by, and for, indi-
viduals. 

We have lately come 
to embrace the 

individual 

should not give the 
group what it wants, 
but what the individ-

uals themselves want. 
This, like the invis-
ible hand and golden 
rule of cuI ture, will 
lead us away from the 
prefabrica ted adver-
tisements that are our 
modern American 
pop cul ture, and into 
somethi ng artistic, 
vivid and intelligent . 

Many reputa-
ble sources of con-
servative thought 
(like the Sunday 
funni es' Mallard 
Fillmore) lash out 
against the news 
media 's liberal bias 
on a near daily 
basis, touting their 
own individualist 
agenda of "Just

point of view at all

eral bias, ho~ever, is an example 
of the vestiges of the people in 
the media who understand their

There is no vast conspiracy of lib-

the knowledge amassed by individ-
ual journalists, who want to teach 
society the lessons that they have 
learned first-hand, instead of let-
ting the ignorant form their own 

to bask in the warm rays of enlight-

··Quien es mas Macho? 
n.e Abu Ghraib Photos" 

Professor Susan Willis, Duke University 
4pm, deCerteau Room, 3155 Literature Building 
The Abu Ghraib photos con-

flate and render visible two of 
America's grubby secrets: lynch-
ing and pornography. In this talk, 
Professor Willis considers the 
history of the Ku Klux KJan and 
its relationship to current U.S. 
foreign policy. She reprises D.W, 
Griffith's Birth of a Nation to 
understand the Jessica Lynch story and the current role of the 
"security mom." She inquires into the ideology of masculinity 
"both Muslim and Christian" and demonstrates the prevalence of 
pornography in unexpected mainstream places. Her talk reads his-
tory through the lens of culture and undermines ideology with 
irony. 

Professor Willis's talk draws on material from her forthcoming 
book, PORTENTS OF THE lEAL: A "RIMEl FOR "OST 9/11 
AMERICA, scheduled to be published by Verso this spring.

"A.S. Safe Rides is a high priority 
for us because it is one of those things 
that directly benefits the majority of 
the student body and is directly rec-
ognized as being provided by AS," 
Murphy said. "We need to come 
up with a feasible plan to eliminate 
excessive and abusive usc of this ser-
vice by an individual student while 
at the same time being financially 
responsible so that students' money 
isn't being wasted." 

Lack of funding to A.S. Safe Rides 
over past years has created over-
spending, according to Thurgood 
Marshall College Senior Senator 
Kate Pillon. Last year, the program 
- called Triton Taxi at the time 
- received $1 7,500. Under the cur-
rent proposal, A.S . Safe Rides would 
be allocated $28,400, representing 
the minimal amount necessary to 
run such an operation, PiUon said. 

Although colleges with smaller 
student populations stand to lose 
money under the plan, a larger 
fee referendum for those colleges 
makes up the difference, according 
to Sixth Cc;>llege Senior Senator 
Matt Corrales. Under' its referen-
dum, Sixth College receives eight 
dollars per student. 

"We have one of the largest ref-
erendums on campus, which makes 
up for the cut to college council 
funding," he said. "Personally, 1 like 
seeing the money going directly to 
students and services for students 
instead of filtering through college 
councils. " 

Curting college council funding 
may be a move toward stripping 
college councils from A.S. support, 
Pillon said. 

"To have A.S. fund colleges even 
a lirtle is an acknowledgment of 
their value," she said. "I think that 
the college system brings a lot to 
the university, and totally detaching 
college councils from A.S. is a move 
I think will hurt our campus." 

The proposed budget would 
also eliminate individual line items 
for Cultural Celebration and Excel 
Leadership Conference and incor-
porate those funds into the gen-
eral funds available for request by 
student organizations. This change 
was meant to force events such 
as Cultural Celebration, which is 
sponsored annually by Thurgood 
Marshall College, to request funds 
from the Student Organizations 
Funding Advisory Board like 
other campus groups, according to 
Murphy. SOFAB is the main finan-
cial advisory committee for all quar-
terly student organization funding.

Bitly Wong/Guardian 
Money IMltI!n: AS. President Christopher Sweeten proposed across·the-board cuts 
to college councils in his budget plan presented to the A.S. Council on May 11 . 
dud and requiring everyone to 
go through the SOFAB process 
to ensure equal treatment and fair 
practices," he said. 

Although requiring the cultural 
events to apply through SOFAB is 
understandable, Pillon said, she was 
concerned that the $287,750 unal-
located student organizations pot, 
which would take a 3.7 percent cut 
under the proposed budget, would 
be too small to fund all needed 
organizations. 

"It's OK to move toward subject-
ing everything to the same scrutiny," 
she said. "But how do we justify 
keeping 'Student Org Unallocated' 
at the same level? How is it fair to 
have orgs and Cultural Celebration 
pull from that same pot?" 

Stipends for A.S.-funded stu-
dent services, such as Student-Run 
Television and KSDT radio, would 
be eliminated under the latest draft 
of the proposed budget. Income 
from A.S . enterprises, like the ropes 
course and A.S. Lecture Notes, 
that previously funded the stipends 
wasn't able to sustain a level of 
profits needed for student services, 
according to Murphy. 

"We have no money to allocate 
towards stipends [for] our services," 
he said . "I would still prefer to main-
tain at least part of their stipends -
its just not possible at this point." 

Both KSDT general co-man-
ager Sam Abraham and opera-
tions manager ](jp Mitchell said 
they were disappointed with the 
proposal, but acknowledged that 
their stipends had initially been 
insignificant. The KSDT general 
manager currently receives $20 per 
week, while all other staff positions 
receive a 51 15 stipend. 

"It's not like we're in this for the 
money," Mitchell said. "At the rate 
we were getting paid before, it was 
not representative of the time we 
actually put in our student service, 
but it was rather just to get at least a 
lirtle something for compensation. 
To lose that, I'm disappointed, but 
our budget has been cut so much 
it's not like I didn't expect it." 

Stipends for aU A.S. executive 
board positions would take a cut of 
40 percent from last year. In addition 
to scaling back pay for commission-
ers and vice presidents, Sweeten's 
budget would eliminate stipends for 
all 24 college senators. Last year, 
each senator received a S 1 0 stipend 
each week for 30 weeks. 

Cutting senator stipends would 
free up much-needed money for 
other priorities, Sweeten said during 
an informal budget meeting with 
counci I members. However, abolish-
ing those stipends would also remove 
senator accountability to the A.S. 
Council, according to Murphy. 

"If a senator is never showing up 
to meeti ngs. A.S. can do nothing to 
kick them out of office," he said. 
"Whereas if we gave a stipend to 
each senator and threatened to take 
away their weekly stipend for each 
meeting they miss, senators would 
be more accountable to A.S." 

However, the council has not 
penalized ab ent senators in past 
years, allowing them to receive 
tipends even when they did not 

attend . 
Sweeten suggested academic 

compensation in place of stipends, 
including school credit.

Professors' En lish under uestion 

By MARNEIlI FEDUlS 
Senior Staff Writer 

B ei.ng a college student sometimes "means having to deal with professors or teaching assistants who might not be on quite the same level as you. But 
when these instructors do not speak English well, should 
students have to be the ones to go through the extra trouble 
of deciphering lectures? 

For North Dakota State Representative Bette Grande, 
the answer is a resounding "no." Grande proposed a bill 
that would allow students to drop a class without academic 
penalty and receive a refund if their reason for doing so is 
that the instructor does not speak English clearly with good 
pronunciation. If IO percent of a class gave the same com-
plaint, the university would have to move the instructor into 
a non-teaching position. 

"Students are in the university to be educated; they're 
paying to be educated," Grande said. "If the product given 
to them is not working, there should be some form of 
recourse." 

More recently, the bill was amended to urge North 
Dakota's Board of Higher Education to create a universal 
policy to address the issue. In California, there is no legisla-
tion to mandate what universities can do if professors or 
instructors are not intelligible. 

"It may be less of an issue here in California," Associate 
Vice ChanceUor of Undergraduate Educations Mark 
Appelbaum said. "Many students come from a backgrowld 
where the.ir grandparentS or parentS are non-native English 
speakers, and they learn how to shift: between English and 
another language." 

In j 987, the California Legislature passed a resolution 
requiring the UC system to evaluate the oral competence 
of all prospective teaching assistants. However, campuses 
have their own programs for making sure that international 
faculty and graduate students are prepared to teach in th e 
classroom. 

At UCSD, an international graduate student must take 
a IS-minute oral examination to determine their language 
abilities before becoming a TA. If he or she fails, lan-
guage classes are available with the Center of Teaching 
Development located on campus. Through the International 
Teaching Assistam Language Program. graduate students 
receive assessments and learn teaching technique . 

" ssentially all international graduate students arc 
required to demollStrate a hi~h level of English comprchen-

dolorer in is alisl exerit luptat Ian 
hendrem verit ate conulla 

sion," ITALP Coordinator Martha StackJin said. "There is 
concern that they have the resources they need to learn to 
communicate more effectively if they need to." 

The initial North Dakota biU received much attention 
from eduC'Jtors around the country and raised the question 
of whether universities are doing aU they can to address 
what some see as a problem. Others, however, are arguing 
that the issue is a cultural one. 

niversity of Georgia Education and Speech 
Communication professor Donald Rubin began a study 
about 15 years ago in which he played an audiotape of a 
Standard American English speaker giving a lecture in from 
of undergraduate students. First, the tape was played with a 
photograph of a visually identifiable East Asian man in frOnt 
of the students. Afterwards, the same tape was played with a 
photograph of a Euro-American man. 

When students were asked to fill in missing words in 
a transcript of the lecture, they made 20 percent more 
mistakes when looking at the photograph of the Asian rnan 
than that of the Euro-American. 

"U.S. undergraduate students are cued to believe that 
they are listening to an international insrructor giving a lec-
ture even if they are in fuct listening to a speech by a teacher 
born and raised in Ohio," Rubin stated in an e-mail. "Their 
rating of the speaker's accent is more pronounced and their 
recall of the lecture diminishes." 

While his model used participants attending schools in 
Ohio and Georgia, Rubin points out that students from a 
more cosmopolitan area such as California would have a 
different reaction in his study. 

"Tho e who are used to hearing Standard American 
English spoken by individuals who are identifiable as being 
of East Asian ance try might be less susceptible to th e 
biased listening process we discerned, " Rubin said. 

Rubin suggests teaching studentS how to listen actively 
and immerse themselves in different kinds of English, as 
well as training instructors. 

WIth srudies such as Rubin's, ome are wondering 
whether students are just not putting in enough effort in the 
classroom and are simply u ing an insttuctor's intelligibi lity 
as an excuse. 

"\Nhen srudents are enrolled in cha llenging c1asse -, it 
is natural to sea rch for orne e.~ternal explanations for the 

dif6cultie.~ they are experiencing." Rubin said. "The inter-
national insrructor' spoken English is one uch convenient 
Factor to indict." 

I Io"'cv~r, Grande, who ha~ received a multinlcle I) f 

Roy Pak/Cuord,on 

responses to her initial bill, insists that universities must do 
their part to make sure that students are getting what they 
pay for and that T As and faculty members speak intelligible 
English. 

"Universities always point to the students' fault - that 
they should just work harder- but thi is a two-way thing," 
Grande said . "The common denominator in this country is 
English. Yes, have diversity, but we have to communicate 
with each other with English." 

Others believe that dIe problem lies not only in 
aetual language issues but also in the insrructor' abili ty 
to communicate with students. Suggested solutions to the 
problem include a more comprehensive program in which 
future TAs learn about both language and the culture of 
the American classroom, as well as other teaching tech-
niques. 

"In my classes, r cover communication skills, wheth-
er it is public speaking or one-on-one," Stacklin said. 
"[Communication] requires different strategies - there arc 
cultures where strategies of business communication are to 
be polite and indirect, but if you speak that way here, you 
will have very frustrated recipients." 

According to Stacklin, classes at ITALP touch upon 
language slcills and ways for graduate studen ts to have the 
right rapport with their students. 

Cognitive science graduate student Dan Liu, originally 
from China, has experienced fi rst-hand the challenges of 
teaching in an American classroom. She recalled a time la t 
year when she encountered blank faces as she introduced 
herself for the first time in from of her class at UCSD. 

"Language was a big problem for mc wh en I was a TA 
for the first time," Liu said . "Sometillles I couldn't under-
stand the que tions dIe st\ldent~ raised, and olllctime, I 
couldn 't find the best words ro eXlllain the answer." 

Liu had to use other techniques, like asking the studcn~ 
to repeat thcir question or having them write their que~­
tions on the board. In one instance, she explained a deriva-
tive by CUttiJlg up a muffin ,he brought ro class. For the 
Illost part, she found that student~ were \\ illing to work \\ Ilh 
her through the language barri er. However, she also said 
that mcrican snldents have more complaints in general. 

" tudentS here arc more willing 10 challenge you with

Beijing and San Diego making business 
connections at home and abroad 

Student organization performs research on 
job markets in China and United States 

By LAURA CANTER 
Staff Writer 

In the business world , it never hurts to 
have good friends in high places. A new 
organization on campus, where industry 
meets camaraderie, makes this a possibil-
ity. T he U.S.-Ch ina Business Association 
focuses on creating an alliance between 
China and the United States and improv-
ing relations between the two countries. 

Formed in January, the UCBA will 
allow students from all majors to make 
connections with their peers and broaden 
their business horizons. 

:-JOt only will studen ts learn about busi-
ness. they will also have the opportunity to 
begin friendships with other group mem-
bers. 

"I wanted to get a group of people 
together with similar goals to build a 
network," said Ni ng Ho, UCBA fo und-
ing president and a senior at Thurgood 
Marshall College. 

UCBA involves srudents who share the 
same interests and are willing to make con-
tacts, all the while enhancing leadershi p 
skills. Students are expected to establish 
relationshi ps as they prepare for the busi-
ness world . 

"Business depends on not only what you 
know, but who you know," said Li Chen, 
a Marshall junior and social event planner 
for UCBA. "It's all -i nclusive, it's about 
dealing with reality and getting something 
out of it." 

UCBA educates students beyond the 
classroom as they learn about job markets 

in China and expectations that fi rms have 
for their potential employees. The club's 
research is focused on relative em ploy-
ment, labor laws, job forecasting and major 
corporation profiling. 

"The UCBA does research on all COI\1-
panies affiliated with the United States 
and China," said Shao-yun Tang, a junior 
at Earl Warren College and the U . . 
Research Officer for UCBA. The organi -
zation is composed of research teams that 
gather information about U.S. companies 
that have offices in China . 

The Chi na research tea m 1110ni tors trad~ 
regulations and explores job opportunities 
in the United States. The U.S. research 
team investigates U.S. trade regulations 
and seeks job openings at firms connected 
wi th China within the United States. Other 
teams are involved with administration, 
profit/loss projection , accounting, adver-
tising - with one dedicated to planning 
socia l events. 

The UCBA is working to expand its 
connections by collaborating with students 
at the University of Beijing. 

"[The Education Abroad Program] has 
already exchanged students, making it pos-
sible for the club to grow," sa id Ho, who 
will be going abroad to China this sum-
mer to make contacts with other Chinese 
organizations. His goal is to recruit more 
people who are interested in UCBA. 

The UCBA is 15 members strong and 
is enthusiastically looking to recruit more 
members. For more information on the 
organization visit their Web Site at

students have different expectations in the 
United Sutes than in India. where he is orig-
inally from. He says that while his tendency 
to speak very fast may cause some confusion. 
it is ultimately the different grading system 
that has caused the most difficulty. He points 
out that homework counts a lot for grades. 
and therefore. students ask TAs for as much 
of the solution to a problem as possible. 

"I am more than willing to explain the 
concepts to the students, but I find it hard to 
justify to myself to solve the assignment for 
them - something for which I have Jotten 
bad reviews in the past," Agarwal state in an 
e-mail. KIt is highly unlikely for someone to be 
hired who doesn't have a good command of 
spoken English. Sometimes we hire someone 
who is hard to understand, but in California, 
we're so used to hearing all sorts of variations 
of English that we have to learn how to do it 
well." 

Political science professor David Forman-
8arziJai, who received his degree in Israel and 
has taught in the United States for 13 years, 
says that language issues are not so much of a 
problem for him_ 

"I think a good and serious student will 
look beyond an accent," he said. "It should 
not be an issue. In an academic setting, what is 
imponant is the content of a lecture." 

Most students at any university will 
encounter an instructor who is more th2n just 
a little hard to understand. 

"I had one non-English-speaking profes-
sor, and I think that initially it was a problem 
and there were people a little thrown off by 
it," John Muir College senior Keerthi Paliath 
said. 

With increasing numbers of international 
graduate students and professors coming to 
American universities every year, the issue is 
likely [0 be raised again. 

"I think that the bill was meant to be dra-
matic and it was meant to be provocative, and 
in that, it got a lot of attention - and that's 
not necessarily a bad thing," Stacklin said.

Triumphing in the ancient .way of the sword 
UCSD's Kendo team wins first-place Himeno trophy at Harvard Invitational tourna~ent 

By FABIANNE FURMAN 
Staff writer 

UCSD's Kendo team has just achieved 
na tional recogni tion for its efforts. 

Five team members - Takumi Karo. 
Sachiko (Ann) Tamura, Mio Shimizu, 
Gene Kim and Young-Shik (Bryan) Cho 
- flew ro Harvard University on April 23 
to compete in the ninth-annual Harvard-
Invitational Shoryuhai Intercollegiate 
Kendo Tournament. Two days later, the 
team returned. boasting the elaborate 
Himeno trophy and a well-deserved sense 
of pride. 

The Himeno trophy is a hefty golden 
cup that stands about two feet tall and 
resembles the SOrt of trophy that would 
belong to an undefeated college football 
learn, but instead it is passed along each 
year to champions in the ancient art of 
kendo. 

"This' is the largest, oldest and most 
prestigious intercollegiate Kendo rourna-
rnent for undergrads in North America," 
team coach Imre Kovacs said. "Kendo 
players have been participating from the 
United States and Canada for years, and 
this year there was participation from 
Mexico, too." 

[n rotal, 26 teams competed, with each 
participating university permitted to bring 
as many tcams as it wished . 

"We could only afford ro send one team, 
so it 's pretty impressive that we won, " 
UCSD Kendo artist Tam Hoang said . 

Winning the tournament is a great 
honor in the eyes of those who practice 
Kendo, but the art form is practically 
unknown in American popular culture . 

Kendo, literally translated as "the way 
of the sword," has its origi ns in the sword-
wielding Japanese sa murai class of the 12th 
century. Today, the practice of kendo is 
a simulation of ancient samurai fighting 
techniques utilizing bamboo swords, or 
Shinai, body armor and recognition of 
the samurai virtues of bravery, loyalty, 

honor. self discipline and sroic acceptance 
of death. 

"[When doing Kendol you feel like a sam-
urai because you have the same mentality." 
Thurgood Marshall College sophomore 
and team captain Karo said. 

Perfecting the art of kendo is no simple 
task. Though it has been influenced by 
European fencing, kendo has unique rules 
which make it particularly complex and 
technical. 

"There are four targets on your oppo-
nent's body: the trunk, head, wrist and 
throat, and the first person to get two 
points wins the match," Hoang said. 

But scoring exrends beyond simply 
striking an opponent in the appropriate 
target area. 

"You only get a point if the referee 
judges that you hit the target with good 
posture, spirit and form," Hoang said. 
Achieving this physical and mental bal-
ance, known in Japanese as waza. requires 
a great deal of experience and practice. 

According ro Darrel Max Craig, Kendo 
artist and author of "The Heart of Ken do," 
Kendo is not a sport. 

"One should never say, 'We play 
Kendo,'" Craig said . "One who 'plays' 
Kendo has lost the true meaning, along 
with the real spirit, of the art." 

Elaborating on this idea, recognized 
Kendo artist Jirokichi Yamada explains 
the distinction between Kendo and a tra-
ditional sport in his book, "Treatise on 
Kendo": 

"A sport takes on ly a small portion of 
one's life, whereas Kendo takes it all," 
Yamada states in his book. 

Those involved with Kendo stress this 
sense of artistry over all other interpreta-
tions. 

"It is definitely more art than self-
defense," Kato said. "You can 't use it to 
protect yourself." 

The art of Kendo may require focus and 
precision, but for many, it is an influential 
aspect of everyday life. 

"Kendo has shaped the way I view a 
lot of things," Kato said. "Kendo is not 
a sport where you have a grudge against 
your opponent. You have respect for your 
o pponent, and they have respect for you. 
That's the kind of relationship I want 
to have with people outside of Kendo as 
well. " 

as well. When asked if Kendo provided 
stress relief in her life, she said, jokingly, 
"Yeah, because you get to hit people." 

No member of UCSD's Kendo team 
was surprised to win the tournament at 
Harvard University [his year. 

"Although the Shoryuhai is getting big-
ger and bigger each year, and it's much 
harder to win, we went there to win this 
year," Kovacs said. 

Revelle College freshman and Kendo 
team member Tamura has practiced kendo 
for 11 years. . Still, the fact that the triumph was antic-

ipated made the victory no less sweet. Her long-term dedication to her art has 
earned Tamura a position on the women's 
national team, with which she will compete 
in July. While Kendois a serious part of 
life, she enjoys the art as a form of leisure 

"We only lost to UCLA by one point 
last year," Kato said. "It was a really close 
match, so we were determined to take it 
this year, and we did ."

Tritons: Team ends season tied for fifth place 
continued from page ao 

The No. I l-seededTritonswere 
overwhelmed right from the start, 
losing all three doubles matches 
to the Pirates. At the top spot, the 
17th-ranked Triton duo of sopho-
more Marsha Malinow and junior 
Tara Siddiqui fell, 8-6. It got worse 
from there for UCSD, which lost 
both other doubles matchups con-
vincingly. At the No. 2 spot, soph-
omores Kristin Bronowiclci and 
Katie McKee lost, 8-2, to Manuela 
Emmrich and Caroline Grage, 
and at No. 3, Armstrong Atlantic 's 
Dziyana Nazaruk and Johanna 
Dahlback blew senior Jasmin Dao 
and junior Marissa Hilker off the 
court, 8-0. 

T he Pirates didn't waste any 
time clinching the match in singles 
play, taking victories at the No. 
1 spot and No. 5 spots in domi-
nating fashion, 6-0, 6-0. Malinow 

and McKee were the victims of 
Cowper and Grage, respectively. 
Armstrong Atlantic players also led 
in each of the four other matches 
before they were called. 

This loss left the Tritons tied 
for fifth place, the team's high-
est finish since the 2002 season. 
Meanwhile, the Pirates went on to 
upset top-seeded BYU-Hawaii in 
the final, 5 -3, to take the Division 
1I title. This was a major upset, 
with the heavily favored Seasiders 
having ridden a 130-consecutive-
match win strealc into the champi-
onships, and having lost only one 
prior match in their six years in 
the NCAA. 

"[The entire season] was a great 
group effort," LaPlante said. "We 
knew that the group we had com-
ing back was suong, bur with the 
emergence of Malinow [at the No. 
I spot] and perhaps the best three 

combinations at doubles we've 
had in years, the team really went 
over my expectations for the year. 
Everybody worked hard to get to 
this point. I'm way proud of the 
girls ." 

The loss to Armstrong Atlantic 
not only concluded the team's sea-
son, but also marked the end of the 
collegiate careers of ca ptains Dao, 
a four-year player, and Roberts , 
who is graduating early. Dao com-
piled a 7 -6 singles record and 15-
3 doubles record in 2005, while 
Roberts went 15-3 and 4-0. 

Despite the losses of Dao and 
Roberts, the team's future is bright, 
as every other starter should return 
next season. UCSD had a very 
strong season this year, finishing 
20-4. According to LaPlante, she 
has four junior-ranked Southern 
California rec ruits joining next 
year's team. 

Tennis: Swatt wins doubles, singles matches 
continued from page 20 

National Championship,. 
After a 5 -0 sweep against 

Concordia College of New York 
on May II , the men put up a gal-
lant fight against No. 4-ranked 
Armstrong Atlantic on May 12 . 
The men led , 2-1 , coming out of 
the doubles lineup with two big 
wins at No. 2 and No.3 doubles. 
Senior Bryan Swatt and freshman 
Will Phan teamed up to defeat 
Armstrong's Peter Dedik and 
Davor Zink, 8-6, at No.2 doubles, 
while junior Erik Oijala and fresh-
man Blake Meister defeated Taavo 
Roos and Jeremy Mastnak at No.3 
in a quick 8-4 match. 

The first loss came at No. I 
doubles, in which sophomore Seth 
Spector and junior Brent Molden 
were defeated, 5-8. Unfortunately, 
the Tritons were unable to pull out 
the three more victories needed to 
win the contest. 

The lone UCSD singles vic-
tOry ca me at No. I singles: No. 26 
Swatt defeated Robert Jendelund 
in a tough first set, 7-5, before 
closing out the match with a 
quick 6- 1 victory. Unfortunately, 
Armstrong was able to sweep four 
more victories to close out the 
match. Armstrong's Dale White 
defeated Molden, 4-6, 2-6, at No. 
2 singles, while Dedik defeated 

Spector in a see-saw three-setter , 
4-6,6-3,0-6, next door. 

At No. 5 singles, Armstrong's 
Seeker defeated Meister, 2-6, 4-6, 
while Roos defeated Phan, 1-6, 
1-6, at No. 6. Oijala, at No. 4, was 
unable to finish his match but was 
down, 0-3, in the third set after 
winning the first set, 6-4, and los-
ing the second, 2-6. 

"We didn't do anything in par-
ticular to prepare for the Round of 
16: We just wanted to keep play-
ing at the sa me level we had been 
at," head coach Eric Steidlmayer 
said. "We just wanted to go out 
with energy and play the best we 
could." 

The day before, the Tritons 
swept Concordia, 5-0. The men 
swept the doubles lineup, with 
Swatt and Phan finishing first at 
No. 2 doubles, 8-1, while Spector 
and Molden added a second vic-
tory with a win at No. I, 8-3 . 
Oijala and Meister closed out the 
sweep with an 8-4 victory at No. 
3 doubles. 

[twasn't long before the Tritons 
closed out the match with wins 
across the singles lineup. Swatt 
defeated Concordia's Rodrigo 
Teixeira with a 6-3 , 6-0 victory 
at No. I singles, while Molden 
added the competition-capturing 
victory at No. 2 singles, with a win 

over Kirill Azovstev, 6-2, 6-3 . At 
No.3, Spector was on the ve rge 
of closing out his match, leading 
V1ad Malkin , 6-4, 4- 1, while Oijala 
was tied , 5-5, in the first set of hi 
match at No. 5 singles. 

Meister was also leading his 
opponent, 6-4, 3-1 , when rhe 
match was called, while Phan, at 
No. 6 singles, had just won the 
first set, 7-5. 

The Tritons' run marks the end 
of a successful season and a sal ute 
to their lone senior and captain, 
Swatt. Swatt thrived during the 
2005 season, leading his team to 
numerous victories throughout the 
season and stepping up to take 
the leadership position and guide 
his young teammates. Swatt was 
ranked No. 26 in the nation and 
held a 16-6 overall record this 
season, with the lowest recorded 
losses on the team. The Tritons 
combined for a 74-50 record in 
the singles lineup as well as a .500 
doubles record with an overall 44-
22 record. 

Much credit is give n to 
Steidl mayer, wh o was able to turn 
a young group into one of the most 
successful teams in UCSD men's 
tennis history. The team has a 
bright future ahead next year, with 
three juniors and four freshmen 
returning.

Baseball: Tritons triumph over Chico, Cal Poly Pomona, and San Bernardino 
continued from page ao 

field to put UCSD up, 4-1. 
Pinocchio was first-pitch swing-
ing, hit a double down the left-
field line and advanced to third on 
senior shortstop Keith Hernandez's 
ground out to the right side. 
Senior centerfielder Brad Beltz 
then singled to right field, scoring 
Pinocchio for the 5-1 lead . After a 
wild pitch, Clark doubled down the 
left-field line, scoring Beltz. After 
four, the Tritons held a 6-1 lead. 

With one out in the sixth, Gascon 
hit an infield single to third base. 
Robinson then singled to left cen-
ter to put two on. Pinocchio came 
through with the insurance RBI 
with a single up the middle, scor-
ing Gascon, and Hernandez deliv-
ered a single up the middle, scoring 
Robinson for the 8-1 lead. 

Cal Poly Pomona did not go 
down without a fight. In the Bronco 
eighth , Matt Lopez led off with a 
walk and Kevin Falls doubled to 
deep center. With one out, J arrod 
Allen singled to center for two RBIs, 
making the score 8-3 . Cal Poly 
Pomona 's next batter reached on 
an error an d Marc Evans hit an RBI 
single to put runners on the cor-
ners with the score at 8-4, UCSD. 
The Broncos added another rw) on 
UCSD's second error of the inning 
to make the score 8-5. 

With the bases loaded and two 
outs, the Cal Poly Pomona batter 
flew out to left to strand three. 

The victory sent the Tritons 
to the final day of the CCAA 
Championships against host Chico 
State to battle for the title, where 
UCSD would have to defeat the 
Wildcats twice to be crowned cham-
pion . The Triton-Wildcat matchup 
did not disappoint. While UCSD 
and Chico State split their regu-
lar-season series with two games 
apiece, preseason pollsters chose 
the Wildcats to finish ahead of the 

Tritons one-two in the conference. 
But the end results were flipped, 
with UCSD ultimately coming out 
on top after 23 innings and more 
than eight hours of play. 

UCSD won the first game, 5-4, 
in II innings. CCAA Tournament 
MVP Lawson doubled in the II th 
frame, scoring junior pinch hitter 
Damian Fante for the lead and win. 
Sweany (3-0) earned the win on the 
mound. 

With one out in the first, UCSD 
talJied the first run when Lawson 
doubled down the left-field line 
to score junior leftfielder David 
Gomez. 

In the UCSD second, Robinson 
singled to left field followed by a 
si ngle by Hernandez to put two on. 
A passed ball allowed the runners 
to move up to second and third. 
Bel tz then hit a sacrifice Ay, scoring 
Robinson for the 2-0 lead . 

With one out in the Chico State 
third, Trevor Weedon and Greg 
Gonzalez hit back-to-back singles 
and Jeff Walker walked to load the 
bases. Ryan Martin then lined a 
shot right to Triton first baseman 
Robinson, who made the grab and 
ragged the runner off first base for 
the unassisted double play to end 
the frame. 

In the Chico State eighth, 
Wildcat Chad Nelson delivered 
the game-tyi ng double, clearing the 
bases to even the score at 4-4 and 
sending UCSD's Lipetz out of the 
game in favor of Sweany. Chico 
State's Justin Jacque singled to righ t 
to put runners on the corners with 
one out sti ll in the inning. UCSD 
then intentionally walked Gonzalez 
to set up the force at any base. The 
strategy paid off as the Hernandez-
to-Pinocchio-to-Robinson double 
play ended the inning with the score 
tied. 

After scoreless ninth and tenth 
frames, UCSD's Fante singled with 

one out and Lawson came up big 
with his third double of the game 
to put UCSD bad, in front for the 
5-4 victory. 

In the second game, the Tritons 
loaded the bases with no outs and 
Gascon delivered the game-winning 
single, giving UCSD the CCAA 
title. Triton junior pitcher Jose 
Nav:arro, pitching on one day of 
rest, went 4.1 innings, allowing no 
runs and two hits. 

In the sixth, Chico State capi-
talized on two UCSD errors and 
scored three times to take a 5-4 
lead. 

In the bottom half with one gone, 
Hernandez singled, his third of the 
game. Beltz then doubled over the 
rightfielder's head, setting up run-
ners on second and third. Clark then 
lined a single through the left side 
scoring Hernandez, but Beltz was 
thrown out at the plate with Clark 
advancing to second on the throw. 
Pinch hitter Fante singled up the 
middle for the go-ahead two-out 
RBI, scoring Clark. UCSD led 6-5 
after six. 

In the top of the eighth, Wildcat 
pinch hitter Jeff Mayberry lined a 
single to center field, driving in a 
run with two outs to tie the game, 
6-6. With twO on and two out, 
UCSD's Lipetz entered and walked 
Walker to load the bases. Triton 
southpaw Navarro came in to face 
the lefty, Martin, and froze him with 
a breaking ball for strike three. 

In the bottom of the 12th, Fante 
was hit in the head by a pitch and 
Lawson reached base on a fielder's 
choice. Morehead then found no-
man's land with a bloop single over 
second base to load the bases with 
no outs for Gascon. Gascon lined a 
single into right field, giving UCSD 
the CCAA Championship. 

The Tritons wilJ await word on 
their postseason chances for the 
NCAA West Regional .

Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD will not soon forget 
the 2005 baseball season, or the 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association Championships that 
took place in Chico, Calif., May 12 
through May 14. 

On the final day of the tourna-
ment, the Tritons (23-17 CCAA, 
33- 19 overall) defeated Chico State 
(24-1 I CCAA, 37-12 overall) twice, 
5-4 and 7-6, in II and 12 innings, 
respectively, to capture their first-
ever CCAA championship. 

In the opener of the double-
elimination tournament, UCSD 
fell to Cal Poly Pomona (25-14 
CCM, 29-21 overall), 6-4. Thus, 
each ensuing game meant po ible 
elimination for the Tritons, but 
they would not have it. 

UCSD downed Cal State San 
Bernardino (22- 17 CCM, 25-2 1 
overall) in the first elimination 
game, 3- 1, and sent the Coyotes 
packing. Triton senior ace Logan 
Boutilier (11 -2) pitched seven hut-
out innings, aided by three double 
plays to record hi single- eason 
UCSD record II th win. Senior 
second baseman Ricky Pinocchio, 
senior first baseman Brian Robinson 
and senior third baseman Alex 
Gascon had two hits apiece. Senior 
clo er hlomo Lipetz recorded the 
final two outs and tranded the 
base full of Coyotes to earn his 
seventh save of the year. 

The Tritons' econd victory 
of the championship was · sweet 

W men' 
toAm~ 

revenge, as they again squared 
off against Cal Poly Pomona, this 
time eliminating the Broncos in 
high fashion, 8-5. The victory also 
marked a milestone for UCSD head 
coach Dan O'Brien, who earned his 
200th career victory in his eighth 
season at the Triton helm. 

UCSD junior hurler Byron 
Grubman (6-3) went 7.1 innings, 
allowing three runs, for his third-
straight win. Gascon and senior 
designated hitter Joel Clark had 
three hits apiece, and seven dif-
ferent Tritons taUied RBIs. Junior 
reliever Matt Sweany threw the 
last 1.2 innings and stunned the 
Broncos for his third save of the 
year. 

With one out in the UCSD 
third, Clark singled. Junior out-
fielder and CCAA FirstTeam elec-
tion Matt Lawson delivered a oiple 
to the left-center gap with two 
outs, scoring Clark to put UCSD 
in front. Sophomore catcher David 
Morehead, another CC Fir t 
Team se lection, continued the 
two-out attack with an RBI sin-
gle through the left side to push 

CSD up, 3- 1. Gascon doubled 
to left-center field, but Morehead 
was thrown out at the plate. [t was 
ruled that Morehead attempted to 
roll through the catcher (and not 
slide), and he wa automatically 
ejected from the game because of 
league rule . 

Robinson led off the Triton 
founh with a home run to right

Women's 
crew sets 

new record 
By JESSICA NAGER 

Staff Writer 

The Triton women's crew 
team broke a school record May 
7 at the Pacific Coast Rowing 
Championships, held at Lake 
Natoma, Calif. For the first time 
in the sport's history at UCSD, 
the varsity team broke the even-
minute barrier, finishing the race 
at six minutes, 54.9 seconds. 

"The performance was trans-
formational," head coach Pattie 
Pinkerton said . "They did the 
race into a headwind , so rea lly it's 
five econds or two boat-lengths 
faster." 

Senior Elizabeth Record won 
a collegiate enior gold medal , a 
confe rence title. T eammate junior 
Mel Kaelberer received a silver 
medal for the 'arne honor. 

The varsity eight-boat finished 
in second place, while the varsity 
four-boat took third place in the 
weekend 's competition. 

Pinkerton ca ll ed the perfor-
mance of the varsity eight-boa t 
very trong, and added that the 
performance "puts us in a very 
good position to get a bid for the 
National Championships." 

The varsity eight-boat - com-
posed of enior Anne Roddy, junior

finished in first place at 6:44.3 . 
The Tritons' varsity eight finished 
before last year's silver medalist, 
Humboldt State, which finished 
the race at 7 :03.4. 

"We have been posting 
some terrific times in training," 
Pinkerton said. "It was exciting 
to see the women put it together 
in the race and pull a record time. 
Our goal as a crew was to break 
seven minutes this year, and to 
do it by five seco!1ds, into a head-
wind, is awesome." 

The race was critical since 
it was the final opportunity for 
the Triton women to secure a 
bid for the NCAA Division [I 
Championships. It was equally 
exciting for the squad since UCSD 
has been closing in on Western 
Washington and Humboldt State, 
its main rivals, all season. The 
results from this weekend move 
the Tritons into second place in 
the region for the varsity-eight 
competition. 

T he varsity four-boat - made 
up of Record, Kaelberer, sopho-
more Megan Haden, sophomore 
Helenaz Moteabbed and junior 
coxswain Phoebe Lee - also had 
an impressive weekend. Their 
performance warranted a jump 
into third place at the regional 
level. Western Washington took 
an early lead, leaving UCSD in 
a battle for second place against 
Humboldt State, which managed 
to edge away from the Tritons in 
the last 600 meters of the race. 

"The crew rowed a techni-
cally strong race and rowed hard," 
Pinkerton said. "But they'll need 
to fmd more of an edge to make 
their mark if we get an NCAA 
bid ." 

The team will find out May 
17 whether it will compete in the 
NCAA Division II Championships, 
to be held May 26 through May 
29 at Lake Natoma.
