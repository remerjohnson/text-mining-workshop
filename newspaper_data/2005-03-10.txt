Ultimate disc team 
faces suspension 
Area schools to charge 

fines for damage to fields 
By CHRlmNE CLARK 

Staff Writer 
The UCSD men 's ultimate 

disc club team has been suspended 
for three weeks and will have to 
pay fines as a result of damage 
done to the fields of local schools 
during the team 's annual 
President's Day Tournament. The 
tournament, one of the largest in 
the nation, has also been canceled 
for next year. 

Held over the President's Day 
weekend, the tournament included 
47 club teams from all over the 
country, but was canceled by cam-
pus personnel in order to prevent 
field damage during the heavy 
rains. 

As a result of the campus field 
closure, the teams decided to move 
the competition to different fields 
near the UCSD campus, according 
to UCSD Club Sports Director 
Scott Berndes. 

"They were playing on Marshall 
Field, but when it started raining 
we told them that the tournament 
was off and that the fields were 
closed," Berndes said. "Once they 
couldn't play at UCSD, they pan-
icked and decided to play at the 
local schools." 

As the bigg t event for the 
sport on the West Coast, the annu-
al competition includes teams from 
colleges as far away as Harvard and 
Yale. 

Though the weather forced 
cancellation of the first day of play, 
tournament organizers decided to 
continue playing on various fields 
around the San Diego area, accord-
ing to tournament director Jake 
Chang. 

"There was pressure on us to 
accommodate those teams who 
were flying in on their own dime, " 
team co-captain Adam Desjardins 
said. 

However, director of recreation 
David Koch said he disagrees with 
the team's decision. 

"They could have done serious 
damage to UCSD's fields - that 
is why we closed the tourna-
ment," Koch sa id . "The students 
made the decision to move the 
tournament o ff-campus without 
conferring with us , and as a result 
they did damage to other fields , 
which now they have to repair .... 
It was not a well thought-out 
decision." 

University City High School 
was one of the local schools used 
for tournament play, and although 
the damage to the school's facili-
ties has not yet been assessed, the 
team used the field illegally, 
according to University City 
High School Athletics Director 
Ed Yandall. 

"Nobody had a contract to use 
the field that particular day," 
Yandall said. "I believe the reason 
why they couldn't use the UCSD 
field was because they didn 't want 
to do any damage to it. I guess 
they spread out and decided to 
use this field because it was 
closed, so they figured they could 
play on it ." 

However, of the five fields used 
for the tournament, only three 
showed signs of considerable dam-
age, according to Chang. 

Berndes said he and Koch 
made the decision to sanction the 
team after he was contacted by 
several parent groups and school 
principals who complained that 
the teams caused damage to their 
fields. 

"They canceled the tourna-
ment for one year, we have to pay 
for the repairs and we have to 
make apologies to some of the 
members of the community,"

THURSDAY, MARCH 10, 2005 

By PATRICK ALLEN 
Senior Staff Writer 

On March 4, the Student 
Affirmative Action Committee 
held a "peak-Out" rally in 
response to the airing of pornogra-
phy on Student-Run Television. 
The rally was also meant to address 
the problems of racial and sexual 
domination at UCSD, which have 
been overlooked by the A.S. 
Council and the media, according 
to SAAC Chair Emily Leach. 

"Something is wrong on cam-
pus, but does anyone notice'" 
Leach said. "I see hurt. I see dis-
empowerment. I see anger. 
Things border on hate speech and 
hate crime, and we are the voices 
of resistance." 

More than a dozen people 
spoke at the event, which was 
meant to serve as a forum for stu-
dents who feel silenced, with stu-
dents watching from the audience. 

While some of the speakers 
addressed the campus "climate" in 
general, many focused on their 
personal experiences and their 
opinions of the Koala . Asian 
Pacific-Islander Student Alliance 
Representative Mohan Kanungo 
said that he has faced racial slurs 
and jeers of " terrorists" while 
passing by Porter's Pub. 

The coalition also discussed 
the existence of the Koala, whose 
editor appeared in the Feb. 3 
SRTV sex video. Leach said the 
Koala isolates minorities by mak-
ing them targets of the publica-
tion's humor - a subject of cam-
pus con trover y in past years. 

"We are terrorized and target-
ed as images for satire and come-
dy," Leach stated in a letter to the 
A.S. Council, expressing her disap-

pointment with its response to the 
porn video. "We are told that we 
do not belong, that we have 
unnecessary privileges, and when 
we raise our voices, we are told 
that we are 'too sensitive.'" 

Speakers at the rally echoed 
Leach's frustrations with the publi-
cation. Thurgood Marshall College 
freshman Kyle Samia said that he 
felt the publication was offensive. 

"The Koala has defiled the 
intent of free speech, and it offends 
me as an American," Samia saId. 
"VVt: - the religious, the queer, 
the ethnic - are not here for the 
entertainment of the campus. 
Until we are treated with equal 
respect, we will be offended." 

Koala Editor and A.S . Elections 
Manager Steve York said that 
there have been problems with the 
publication in the past, but that he 
hopes to move away from its con-
troversial history. 

"While I understand the Koala 
and many groups on campus have 
had a confrontational history, it is 
not my aim to target these groups 
in my role as editor," York said. "I 
see the Koalo in my term more as a 
social and entertainment organiza-
tion, and it is my aim to make it so. 
Certainly there will be problems 
given the history; it~ just ridiculous 
for people to assuJ?e because the

Newspaper office hit in burglary 
Personal items reported stolen, police say 

By CHARLES NGUYEN 
Staff Writer 

Several personal items were 
stolen after burglars broke into 
the Guardian's Student Center 
offices sometime last weekend, 
according to UCSD police detec-
tive Yolanda Smith. 

The burglary occurred 
between 10:05 p .m. on March 5, 
when News Editor Vladimir 
Kogan left the office, and 11 : 15 
a.m. the following morning, 
when the staff began the paper's 
production, according to police 
reports. 

"When I got there [Sunday 
morning), most of the file cabi-
nets in the photo office were 
open , and the drawers in my 
desk were opened as well ," 
Kogan stated in an e-mail. "We 
realized that there had been a 
break-in after we noticed that 
the cabinets had been gone 

through in all of the other 
offices as well." 

There was no evidence of 
forced entry, according to Smith . 
Because the front door and win-
dows were sti ll locked in t he 
morning, staff members have 
speculated that the perpetrators 
broke into the office using a back 
door that leads into the office's 
unused darkroom. 

"On Sunday afternoon , we 
discovered [the back door] 
propped sli ghtly open by an 
apron and the light on in the 
darkroom," Kogan stated. "The 
front door and all of the windows 
in the office were locked when I 
left on Saturday night and al 0

Desjardins said. 

The repairs, which are es ti -

I A.S. COUNCIL AT A GLANCE 
A.S. Meeting '24 - March 9 

Reports 
President Jenn Pae 

Pac reported that she signed 
the Food Co-op Space 
Agreement on March 7. 

The agreement sets the guide-
lines for the operation of the 
Food Co-op satellite in Price 
Center. Pae also reported tha t the 
governing committees of the 
RIMAC and Canyonview recre-
ational facilities will soon be stu-
dent-run . Since the facilities are 
funded by student fees, university 
regulations require the majority 
of the committee to be students. 

Financial Controller Guo 
Boumoutian 

Bournoutian reported that he 
completed spot checks of expen-
ditures and reimbursements con-
ducted by the A.S. External 
Affairs Office between July and 
December 2004. 

The spot checks included a 
check to see that all of the 
receipts issued for recompense 
were present and justifiable. 
Overall, Bournoutian said that 
the office had conducted sound 
financial transactions throughout 
the period examined. 

Old Business 
Item A 

The council passed a resolu-
tion opposing a UC Office of the 
President proposal to increase 
fees for undergraduate snldents 

from California who had already 
completed 110 percent of the 
credits needed to graduate. 

A.S. Vice President of 
Academic Affairs Carolyn Song 
said that the current discussion is 
favoring a fee of $280 per unit 
over the limit. 

The policy also proposed to 
deny financial aid to students who 
start the academic year with 110 
percent of the units needed to 
graduate, according to Song. 

The council said that the poli-
cy would unfairly burden stu-
dents who change their major 
during their time at UCSD and 
would contradict the mission of 
the university to provide student 
access to quality education. 

Item F 
The council allocated $1,000 

to "Recess," an event organized 
by the Revelle College residential 
advisors. The event will feature 
activities including slides, laser 
tag and tetherball. It will take 
place in Revelle Plaza on May 20.

I BRIEFLY 
Referendum to go 

before student vote 
On March 4, the AS. Council 

approved the placement of a referen-
dum on the spring ballo~ which asks 
students to approve changes to the 
council's structure. Approved by a 
vote of 13-6-4, senators decided that 
students should vote on possible 
changes to their representative body. 

Currently, there are 24 college sen-
ators who vote on the AS. Council. 
Serving on both the campuswide body 
and tfieir 0'M1 college council, each 
senator is elected by students at a sin-
gle college to represent that specific 
college and grade level. 

If passed, the referendum would 
reduce the number of college senators 
from 24 to 12. tt would also create six 
campuswide senators who would be 
elected by the entire university. In addi-
tion, one first-year senator from each 
college, who would not serve on col-
lege councils, would be appointed by 
the AS. Council at the start of each 
academic year. If approved by two-
thirds of the voting student body, the 
changes would take effect in the spring 
2006 general election. 

The referendum needed the 
approval of lv'/o-thirds of the senators 
in order to be put on the ballot. This 
was narrowly achieved when the dis-
senting vote of John Muir College 
Senior Senator Arman Depanian, 
which was sent by e-mail, was reject-
ed by the mail server. As a result of 
the error, his vote was counted as an 
abstention, allowing the referendum 
to be put before the students. 

Universi~ of Colorado 
president resigns 

University of Colorado President 
Elizabeth Hoffman said she will volun-
tarily step down from her position at 
the end of June. Hoffman will end a 
five-year term, during which the uni-
versity has faced several national con-
troversies including allegations that the 
school's football program used sex 
and alcohol to recruit players and out-
rage over a professor's comments. 

' It has become clear to me that, 
amid the serious matters the 
University of Colorado now confronts, 
my role as the leader of the university 
has become an issue,' Hoffman stat-
ed in a March 7 letter of resignation to 
the CU Board of Regents. "It appears 
to me it is in the university's best inter-
est that I remove the Issue of my 
future from the debate so that nothing 
inhibits CU's ability to successfully cre-
ate the bright future it so deserves~ 

In addition to ending her leader-
ship of the 52,OOO-student system, 
Hoffman said the university would not

victims of the Sept. 11 attack to Nazis. 

' If we could all go back to events 
that began early last year, I am sure 
we would make different decisions,' 
regents' Chair Jerry Rutledge stated in 
a press release from the board. "But 
today, I greatly admire President 
Hoffman's difficult decision, one in 
which she placed CU well above her 
personal accomplishments and long-
term aspirations~ 

Though he praised Hoffman's 
'strong will" and 'steady hand: 
Rutledge said he agreed with her 
decision. 

UC announces final 
offer to clerical union 

In an attempt to avert a labor dis-
pute, the University of California said 
It has offered its final compromise to 
end a yea rs-Iong dispute with its 
18,ODO clerical workers. 

The university has been in negoti-
ations with the Coalition of Union 
Employees since July 2003 to resolve 
union complaints over wages, bene-
fits and parking. 

The university proposal falls short 
of C.UEs demand for across-the-
board salary increases. However, the 
deal would provide aID-percent 
increase for police dispatchers at UC 
Irvine and a 2-percent hike for derical 
workers in the UCSD Medical 

Cente~s nutrition services depart-
ment. 

"Lack of state funding has pre-
vented the university from offering 
across-the-board increases to 
employees throuRhout the UC sys-
tem, including derical workers, for 
the last two years,' the university 
stated in a press release. "As a result, 
salaries for many employee groups 
throughout the UC system are lag-
ging behind the market." 

Grant to help reteach 
national anthem 

In an effort to help Americans 
relearn the words to the "The Star-
Spangled Banner," the govemment's 
National Endowment for the Arts has 
announced plans to spend $25,000 on 
a grant for the National Anthem Project. 

Run by the National Association for 
Music Education, the world's largest 
arts education group, the multi-year 
project is designed to increase knowl-
edge of the anthem's lyrics. 

The campaign was launched after 
findings from a recent poll suggested 
that two-thirds of Americans do not 
know the words to the song and that 
many are not aware of the historical 
events that inspired it.

THURSDAY, MARCH 10, 2005 THE UCSD OUARDIAN 

Nearly half, of top sports schools 
fell short of NCAA benchmarks 

By liLLIAN MCKNIGHT 
U-WIRE (DC BUREAU) 

(U-WIRE) WASHINGTON 
- Nearly 50 percent of all 
Division I athletic schools have 
one sport that failed to reach the 
new NCAA academic benchmark, 
according to 2003 -04 data 
.released at the end of February. 

According to the NCAA, a 
majority of teams that did not 
meet the mark compete in base-
ball, men's basketball and football. 
Approximately 47 percent of 
Division I men's basketball teams 
fall below the new threshold of 
925, which translates into a 50-
percent graduation rate. 
Jacksonville had the lowest score 
among men's basketball teams 
with 800. 

There were 33 men's basket-
ball teams that scored 1,000, 
including Alabama, Delaware 
and the University of South 
Florida. 

Teams below the mark risk 
penalties that include financial aid 
restrictions and the loss of schol-
arship money 

Under the penalties, if a stu-
dent athlete leaves a sports pro-
gram and becomes academically 
ineligible to return, the school 
would be forbidden from giving 
that scholarship to someone else 
for one year. Schools will be 
notified in December 2005 if any 
of their teams will face the penal-
ties. 

"The goal of the academic 
reform package is to reinforce 
good behavior," NCAA President 
Myles Brand said. "The new 
reforms are tough but fair." 

Tr.~ new academic system 

was adopted last April by the 
NCAA Division I Committee on 
Academic Performance, and the 
data are the first set of new aca-
demic scores to be released by 
NCAA. 

The committee's goals includ-
ed the improvement of academic 
standard to ensure increased per-
formance and better prepared stu-

" I can't think of a better 
way than the [scares] to 

signal that the integration 
of athletics and academics 

is indeed the policy far

moving forward. "

NCAA Division I Board of 
Directors 

dent-athletes. 
The NCAA also wanted to 

have a more immediate and real-
time data on academic perfor-
mance. 

The scores are calculated 
based on eligibi lity and retention 
rates, which indicate the fre-
quency at which the players 
graduate. 

Long-term failure to meet the 
new academic standards would 
lead to harsher penalties and fines, 
according to Walter Harrison, 
chair of the NCAA's Committee 
on Academic Performance and 

president of the University of 
Hartford. 

"Any team with a real Iscore) 
below 925 is putting itself at risk 
for historical penalties when four 
years of data have been collected," 
Harrison said. 

Harsher penalties could be 
seen as soon as the 2007 -08 data is 
released if the low-performing 
schools do not improve their 
scores. 

A four-year rate below the 
benchmark will be necessary 
before harsher penalties are enact-
ed. 

The highest scores were seen 
in women's sports. Field hockey, 
lacrosse and rowing had the high-
est average of 981. 

Sportsline.com writer Dennis 
Dodd said he is skeptical whether 
penalties will actually be handed 
down. 

"The main intent was embar-
rassment," Dodd stated in his 
Feb. 28 column:There are too 
many factors to consider before 
schools and programs actually 
talee a hit:' 

However, Division I Board of 
Directors Chair and Chancellor of 
the University of Kansas Robert 
Hemenway said he supports the 
plan. 

"Those institutions that have 
not been dedicated to graduating 
their student-athletes know they 
now are in some considerable 
jeopardy because of having taken 
that approach,"' Hemenway said. 
"1 can't think of a better way 
than the [scores] to signal that 
the integration of athletics and 
academics is indeed the policy 
for intercollegiate athletics mov-
ing forward . ..

A.S. Council not 
• • consIstent on porn Issue 

Since the porn contro-versy broke, the posi-tion of these pages has 
remained consistent: While 
legal, the broadcast was a 
strategic mistake that 
evoked a disproportionate 
response from the adminis-
tration. Unforrunately, A.S. 
leaders cannot say the 
same. 

In an interview last 
month, Commissioner of 
Student Services Kian 
Maleki defended the coun-
cil's policy of content neu-
trality. Of the broadcast, he 
opined, "I think if you did a 
poll of srudents on the 
issue, not very many would 
be concerned." 

Yet last week, Maleki 
blasted the same video as 
"disgusting" and as "some-
thing that I can say with 
certainty most srudents 
would not want to see." At 
the time, the A.S . Council 
also passed a resolution 
calling the broadcast "inap-

propriate" and "distaste-
ful." 

Yet if Maleki's standard 
of propriety changes from 
month to month, the coun-
cil cannot criticize Srudent-
Run Television manage-
ment for failing to uphold 
it. 

For the benefit of all 
those involved, the council 
must pick one stance and 
stick with it. The issue is 
either free speech or the 
ambiguous standard of 
"political and artistic 
speech," but it cannot be 
both. 

More likely, the counci l's 
response is an attempt to 
pre-empt harsher measures 
by the administration, as 
Revelle College 'Senior 
Senator Ted McCombs 
suggested. If so, the lan-
guage of last week's resolu-
tion should have reflected 
this, instead of serving as a 
blanket condemnation of 
the broadcast. 

SAAC's protests are 
unfounded, misguided 
F raming the campus reaction to Student-Run Television's 
pornography broadcast as an 
issue of "white entitlement," 
as the Student Affirmative 
Action Committee has done 
recently, is unfounded and 
detracts from the group's 
focus. If SAAC wants to 
eliminate the marginaliza-
tion of specific groups and 
work toward social equality 
on campus - both com-
mendable goals - it should 
snive to address preexisting 
issues, not create them. 
While a culture of white 
entitlement may well exist 
OIl campus, as well as 'on the 
national scale, the "Koala 
TV" segment reflected this 
no more or less than any 
other SRTV broadcast. 

Despite SAAC's insis-
tence that its grievances are 
not aimed at the Koala, 
SRTV or Koala editor Steve 
York, its press release, open 
letter to the A.S. Council 
and recent speak-out indi-
cate otherwise. This makes 
sense: The past actions of 

the Koala do not exactly 
coincide with SAAC's aims. 

What SAAC neglects to 
realize, though, is that York 
used sex - not sexuality or 
race - to get his free-stu-
dent-speech message across. 
T he fact that the two people 
engaging in sexual acts were 
white and heterosexual does 
say something about society, 
but this is not the central 
issue at play. Indeed, SAAC 
does not adequately support 
its claim that this issue 
would have been treated dif-
ferently if it had involved 
students of color. 

If the participants had 
been of another sexual ori-
entation, perhaps, the cam-
pus and counoy }Vould have 
engaged in a different kind 
of dialogue, and SAAC's pre-
sent argument about prevail-
ing prejudice would likely be 
appropriate. But this is not 
the case. The fact that stu-
dents reacted with "paci-
fism," as SAAC phr-dsed it, 
doesn't automatically make 
this issue indicative of mar-
ginalization.

Lower health inspection scores not 
necessarily indicative of lower quality 

By MARYANN KIMOfO 
Staff Writer 

G rades got you down? 11lt: new health inspection grades of the on-campus dining facilities are enough to 
churn anyone's stomach. Inspection scores averaging 
a decline of 13 .5 points campuswide, according to a 
Feb. 17 GWlrdian article, may have caused more than 
one wayward glance toward the kitchen of a bustling 
eatery. 

But are such worries really founded? 
For one, it makes sense that 

" 

pliance instead of practical food safety. When touring 
a dining hall in an effort to understand the newly 
lowered grades of facilities that had previously boast-
ed near-perfect scores, the errors that show up are 
surprising, to say the least. Points are u"uucted on an 
all -or-nothing basis; the new methodology does not 
differentiate between small infractions, which may 
not necessarily cause health concerns, and more sig-
nificant violations. For instance, if a refrigerator is 
one degree Fahrenheit above the established safety 
temperature of 41 degrees, no matter the content 
stored, points will be deducted for that category. The 

scores from the dining halls should 
be lower than those from coffee carts 
or Price Center's fast-food chain 
restaurants. The limited menus and 

formalize~ food-preparation struc-
ture of the latter two make compli-
ance with safety regulations much 
less complicated. 

The standardized 

methodology does not take into con-
sideration loss of temperature to the 
environment due to constant use by 
patrons, or the fact that the refriger-
ator may store items such as chilled 
sodas, which would not suffer unduly 
from a one-degree differential. 

Another important issue, which is 
a bit more subtle than the first and 
seems almost absurdly obvious once it 
has come to light, is the very nature of 
the grading system implemented in 
the recent health inspection of UCSD 
food facilities. If it seems that food 
standards in the dining halls are pret-
ty much the same as they were last 
year, despite the heightened grades 
last year, it's because there has been no 

inspection 
methodology has not 
only become stricter 
.. , but has also lost 

the flexibility needed 
to emphasize degree 

Points were also lost for reasons 
not related to food at all. Cracks in 
the floor, open doors and boxes left 
sitting on the floor were also causes 
of point deductions at some dining 
facilities, so that matters concerning 
construction of the physical space 
were taken into account along with 
actual safety of consumables. As food 
safety seems to be the issue that caus-
es the most contention among cam-
pus diners, these additional standards

real change in food standards, period. Has anyone 
really noticed a decline in food qualiry? Therein lies 
the dilemma. 

Food facilities have strived so hard to meet the 
requirements posed to them by last year's system t11at 
the new system has simply caught them unaware. 
The standardized inspection methodology has not 
only become stricter in order to match pre-existing 
state regulations, but has also lost the flexibility need-
ed to emphasize Ikgru of transgression in food 
preparation, choosing to err on the side of noncom-

would not direly affect a patron' 
choice in venue. Dining ha lls such as Ocean View 
Terrace, Earl's Place and Canyon Vista have no 
reports in recent history of harm caused by the food 
they serve. Considering only two people need report 
the same symptoms from a dining hall at any given 
time for it to be considered an "outbreal," this is def-
initely heartening news. Fear not, diners of UCSD . 
While a lengthy history of low grades would give 
cause for concern, this one new set of grades should 
not dishearten you from purchasing your meals in a 
dining hall.

The Jeff Gannon quagfllire: A note from the 
Bush adfllinistration's War on Journalislll 

Lines in 
the sand 

Ian S. Port 

Journalists are not like other people. They are always frenet-ic, often paranoid, and the good 
ones are usually kind of ugly. 

Journalism is the kind of profes-
sion where all that matters is how 
good you are. You can't buy a good 
journalism job with a brand-name 
degree or a high connection, 
although those things don't hurt. 
You can count on working extreme-
ly long hours for very little pay and 
rarely being liked or appreciated by 
the world you have to cover. 

BU! thousands of would-be 
muckrakers aim for a job in this 
very competitive field despite all 
the good reasons not to, and it's not 
hard to see why. Good journalism 
- the kind that's disappearing with 
ominous frequency these days - is 
the cornerstone of a healthy 
democracy. Without it, there's no 
one to check whether or not the 
people in power are doing what 
they say they are, or even if they art 
who they say they are. There's no 
one to find out whether or not that 
major corporation is polluting only 
as much as it's allowed. There's no 
one to let us know that the same 
people who started a war are get-
ting rich from it. 

Of course, with the responsibility 
of journalism comes a huge set of 
ethics (the Nw York T rrms set. I 
believe, mkes up almost 100 pages) 
that aim to keep the practice honest. 

UCSD B 

Real journalism outlets - daily, 
metro newspapers, not including the 
San Diego UniOlI-Tribune - follow 
ethical smndards religiously, know-
ing that their credibility (and thus, 
hopefully, their circulation) depends 
on maintaining the public's trust. 

So good journalism is fundamen-
tal to a healthy democracy. What do 
you think the Bush administration is 
trying to do to it' 

Surprise! - nothing good. 
James Dale Guckert, AKA Jeff 
Gannon, is a now-infamous former 
member of the White House press 
corps and symbol of the Bush 
administra tion's utter disregard for 
the importance of a well -function-
ing fourth estate. 

Gannon's shiny top came under 
scrutiny a few weeks ago when he 
asked Bush a rather buttery question 
during an (extremely rare) White 
House press conference. Inquiring 
about working with congressional 
Democrats on the president's Social 
Security project, Gannon quipped, 
"How are you going to work with 
people who have divorced them-
selves from reality?" 

People on the Internet caught it 
first. Bloggers noticed the com-
ment 's vicious partisanship and 
checked out its source. It turns Ollt 
that Gannon was actually James 
Guckert, a reporter warmabe work-
ing for a conservative outfit called 
Talon News. Talon was closely asso-
ciated with GOPUSA, a right-wing 
mouthpiece aimed at "bringing the 
conservative message to America." 

So Jeff Gannon didn't actually 
exist, and James Guckert was not a 
real reporter. The former male 
escort was given day-pass press cre-
dentials to White House press con-

ferences after officials checked to 
see only "that the news organization 
[he claimed to work for] existed." 

White House press credentials 
used to be reserved for top-level 
reporters worlcing for established, 
independent news organizations -
that is, back in the day when presi-
dential administrations held regular 
press conferences and at least paid 

" 
Ganrwn and the pundit'

with the administration's 
larger blatant attempts to

American public, indicate

sinister than an effective

attention to what the media said 
about them. The Bush administra-
tion has held fewer press confer-
ences than any other administration, 
fields only preapproved questions 
from ' reporters and was recently 
exposed for paying media pundits to 
blast its message. 

Which makes Gannongate, as it 
is being called on the Internet, 
seem all the more disturbing. No 

well-informed person would really 
put it past the Bush administration 
to load its press corps up with 
cheerers, instead of the "mean" 
reporters who like to ask real ques-
tions. The scary thing about 
Gannongate is that it's only part of 
the administration's larger media 
strategy, which is to fundamentally 
fracture the American journalism 
establishment. Gannon and the 
pundit-payoff scandal, coupled 
with the administration's blatant 
attempts to propagandize the 
American public, indicate some-
thing far more sinister than an 
effective way to "stay on message": 
They show that the administra-
tion's allegiance is not to the truth 
or to the American people but to its 
own partisan goals . 

What, after all, does an honest, 
well-run and legitimate administra-
tion have to fear from a bunch of 
snotty reporters? The only other 
president who hated the papers as 
much as Bush was Nixon, and it 
wasn't hard to see why when two of 
them caught him with his hands in 
the coolcie jar. 

Bush's strategy is not just to 
fight the mainstream media but to 
slice it up along ideological lines so 
that there is no longer one set of 
facts . He wants all the red states 
watching Fox ews and reading 
Talon and the blue states watching 
CBS (bon voyage, Mr. Rather) and 
reading the Nw York Times. When 
neither side can agree on even the 
most basic facts about administra-
tion policy (like whether or not 
there were prewar ties between 
Saddam and al-Qaida or whether 
weapons of mass destruction were 
found in Iraq), the job is done. 

When the people in power have 
attacked any news outlet that gives 
people a mes age they don't like, 
and the only news people you trust 
are the ones wearing your color, 
the democratic process has ended. 

This has already happened. T he 
most disturbing part of the whole 
Gannon story was how it managed 
to be the talk of both Washington, 
D.C., and the mternet while being 
almost completely ignored by the 
media outlets that should have been 
outraged by it. Only BC and 
CNN have covered the story on 
TV; major newspapers around the 
country were silent about it on their 
news pages even while outraged 
writers sounded off on the op-ed 
side. TIlls points to only one thing: 
For once, the Bush plan is working. 
Big journalism is so afraid of anoth-
er Jayson Blair or Dan Rather - in 
other words, of losing credibili ty in 
the eyes of conservative viewers due 
to Bush propaganda - that it can't 
even bring itself to yell mayday 
when its ship is under fire. 

Bush's "divide and conquer" 
plan for the American media must 
be stopped, but there is serious 
doubt as to whether or not anyone 
is powerful enough to stop it. 
When the integrity of some of the 
largest, oldest and mo t-respected 
news outlets in the world is utterly 
discounted by a large segment of 
the population and relentl essly 
attacked by a corrupt administra-
tion , will enough people lis ten if 
those same journalists say it has 
gone too far ?

A.S. Council decision 
ignored students 

Editor: 
The A.S. Council decision to 

infringe upon Student-Run 
Televison's ability to make 
autonomous programming deci-
sions is not ad because "Koala 'TV" 
carmot show porn. I t is depressing 
because it perfectly illuminates the 
fact that the interests of A.S. repre-
sentatives and the administration 
are in unison. The srudents who 
run the station decided - at what 
they cerrainly knew was thei r own 
peril - to allow the Koaill to pro-
duce a show. The srudents of SR'TV 
were not supporred by their student 
government, even after students 
who contacted the station supporr-
ed the show 57 percent to 43 per-
cent. There is simply no conclusion 
to draw other than our A.S. repre-
sentatives caved to political correct-
ness and finally admitted to what we 
all knew after their support of the 
Price Center expansion: They are 
yet another arm of the administra -
tion. How does this work? 

You see, the admjnistration sets 
up committees, whose members 
receive generous stipends. Who 
fills these committees? A.S. repre-
sentatives, of course. ~o did A.S. 
choose to represent them on the 
registration fee committee, the 
highest-paid committee on cam-
pus? Jean Pac, our A.S. president. 
N early all of the other members of 
this commjttee (and most other 
paid committees), representing the 
six colleges colleges, are students 
from the A.S . Council. They have 
little financia l interest in disagree-
ing with the administration, espe-
cially on such a contentious man-
ner as this one. Even if A.S. repre-
sentatives are not on committees, 

the opportunities of gainjng jobs at 
UCSD, letters of recommendation, 
etc. cause too many links between 
the A.S. Council and the adminis-
tration to go unquestioned. 

If thi s is too cynical a view, then 
at least the students of the A.S. 
COWlcil should reject their admjnis-
tration-funded babysitTer, or "A.s. 
adviser," who holds a seat at all A.S. 
meetings. While this individual may 
not necessarily have a vote on the 
corruruttee, the relationships he or 
she forms with A.S . comminee 
members certai nly allows the 
administra tion's influence to be con-
stantly fell. I hope in til e fumre .S. 
members \vill distance themselves 
from actual campus controversies, 
and not pass resolutions controlling 
otller campus organjzations. SR'TV 
does not need the Associated 
Students as a nanny, wllike A.S. rep-
resentatives, who use the adminjstra-
tion as both a crutch and a leg up.

Senior Staff Writer 

Papular 5panish-with-subtitles flicks like "Y Tu Mama Tambien," "Amores Perros: "La Mala Educaci6n" and 'The Motorcycle Diaries" have saturated 
Hollywood these past few years with images of a blue-
eyed pretty boy who rides a motorcycle. owns a whiny 
dog and answers to the name Gael Garcia Bernal. 
Beneath those aviator goggles, his lilting smile and pen-
sive gaze can strike a girl senseless. 

It may seem like he's the only man to come out of Latin 
America. but the happy truth is that there are many, 
many more men where he came from . So where they at? 

Come March 10, San Diego will be a Latino-lovin' hunt-
ing ground heaven. 

~he San Diego Latino Film Festival hosted by the 
Mecha Arts Center San Diego will showcase over a hun-

.'Trainspotting' director dishes 
on Leo, the Oscars and new film 

By RILEY SALANT-PEARCE 
Staff Writer 

With more than 10 years of fi lmmaking 
under his bel t, British director Danny Boyle 
isn't an easy guy to peg down. From the 
greed- fu eled backstabbing of "S hall ow 
Grave" to the heroin-induced madness of 
"Trai nspotting" or the paradise anarchy of 
"The Beach," Boyle, 48, seems to specialize 
in illuminating the darker reaches of human 
narure. He fo llows up the gruesome smash 
"28 Days Later," however, with a genuine 
change of pace. "Mil lions" is the Story of a 
pair of kids who discover a bag of money 
along the rail road tracks near their new 
house. As they struggle to decide how to use 
the money, the rea li ties of greed, crime and 
hypocrisy invade thei r idyllic subu rban 
neighborhood. Hiatus spoke to Boyle last 
month about his new film and some of his 
most memorab le works. 

"Millions" is a pretty different movie 
than your other films . Was making it a 
fairly new experience? 

Wel l, it's ftmny - they all feel different. I 
know for people watching it, "Mill ions" is a 
rea lly big surprise. It's quite a heartwarming 
fi lm reall y, but they fee l coherent to me, and 
if anything, you fee l there's a danger that 
you're making the same movie over and over. 

Some of the buzz on the Internet has 
already called "Millions" "Shallow 
Grave" with kids. 

It 's fu nny. T here is a bag of money, and I 
suppose that is a similarity. But it comes from 
a really diffe rent period. When we made 
"Shallow Grave," there was a lot of greed in 
Britain at the ti me. It fe lt like a very cynica l 
age. This is a bit more spirinlal, in a way. It's 
about the opposite of cynicism, about having 
faith in peopl e. There's stuff about everyone's 
obsession with money and what to do with it, 
but for (the main character) it's very simple 
what you shoul d do with it. 

When you have a new film coming out, 
how much do you think about how well 
it's received? 

Well you obviously do keep an eye on it, 
and it's very painful when it doesn't work, 
really painful. bviously it' amazing when it 
takes off, and there 's no way you can ever 
predict it. Some of the films we made whi ch 
have worked, like "28 Days Later" and 
"Trainspotting," we thought, "There's no 
way it'll play in America. It'll never even 
open there," and yet there's such an appetite 
for movies here that if it's a decem film, peo-

pi e don't pre-judge it. You never expect any-
thin g, but you always hope. 

You've had a couple ventures into 
making big-budget rums, but it seems 
like the smaller films you've done have 
been more successful. Would you ever 
consider doing another 550 million film, 
or are you sticking to smaller budgets? 

Well, I th ink you're right. I certainly seem 
to be stronger at that kind of sruff. But you 
always as a movie-goer love big movies as 
well. I think there's something about cinema 
that when it 's on a big scale and it plays all 
around the world, there's nothing better. So 
yeah, I'm still tempted, in a way. T he next 
movie we're cloing is a bit bigger, ki nd of a 
medium-sca le film , a sc i-fi fi lm ca ll ed 
"Sunshine." We're hopi ng to start shooting 
July II . When we go back to the UK we're 
going to be setting that up. 

Is it cast already? 
0, no. In fact one of the things I'm 

doing whil e I'm here is doi ng a bi t of casting, 
so we've just started from scratch with it. 

Speaking of casting, people have said 
that a backlash against Leonardo 
DiCaprio after "Titanic" W3.S one reason 
"The Beach" wasn't well received. What 
did you end up thinking of the decision to 
cast him? 

Well , I th ink Leo's a great guy and a very 
good actor. H e's amazi ng, and if you watch 
"The Avi ator," he's f'lntastic. It shows what a 
wonderful actor he is. We - well 1 got 
swamped by the scale of "The Beach." Wi th 
a ki nd of fi lm that costs that much, you have 
to make a lot of your decisions beforehand. It 
becomes an industry, whereas one of the rea-
sons I like working on a small er scale is that 
you can kin d of make it up as you go along. 
I t's easier to sustain the energy level of the 
film when I don't have to make all the deci-
sions beforehand. But if you're going to 
spend a lot of money you've got to earn it 
back. Fifty-million dollars is a lot of money. I 
feel very responsible, so it's important to cast 
a movie star in a film that costs $50 million . 
You can't cast unknowns on that kind of 
calc. 1t just doesn't work. 

Speaking of "The Aviator," the O scars 
are coming up - how much attentio n do 
you pay? 

There 's :l lot of attention paid in Britain, 
even though we usually don't watch them. 
They're on at like three in the morning. I 
wcnt to it once becausc we got a nomination 
for "Trainspotting." It was very disappoint-

***j 
Noone does beat-based clectroni ca better than the C hemical 
Broth ers, and they've 
proved that once aga in 
With t'heir new album, Pusb 
(/Jr Bllttan. Eight years after 
they burst onto the pop 
chans with Dig Yollr OwIl 
Hole , the pair is sti ll making 
dance music that is a vital 
blend of rock, pop and hip-
hop. 

One of the most com-
mercially successful teams 
of techno DJs, the 
Chemical Brothers can be 

heard on both the dance 
floor and on alternative 
radio. However, their lat-
est album is not all that 
different from their last 
album - or any o ther 
album that th ey have pro-
duced for tha t matter. The 
Chemical Brothers may 
not have evolved (l ike their 
French counterparts Daft 
Punk), btl[ their collabora-
tion - a elas IC Chemical 
Brothers move - with 
various artists such as Tim 
Burgess and Anwar 
Superstar hel ps make the 
songs on PIIS/} (be BII((OIl 
seem more fre h than they 
would otherwise. 

Energy-fused numbers 
like "Galvanize," featuring 
Q -Tip, and "The Boxer" 
are the Chemical Brothers 
at their best, but the other 
euphoric tracks don't dis-
appoint. 

The Chemical Brothers 
may not be as ground-
breaking as they were back 
in the '90s, but with each 
album, they continue to 
prove their mastery of awe-
some beats.

Beggars Banquet 

**** O urside of the United States, they have words for this stu ff. 
Dizzee Rascal and the 
Streets, the harbingers o f 
the new wave of British 
not- hip-hop, are called 
"garage" in their home 
nation, but across the 
pond, this electronica-
based dance music '-
which combines the sung 
choruses and spoken verses 
of Hp ·h" il ''1: ''h the spare, 
hard beats of the post-
drum and bass Bri tish club 
music - has no common 
name or identity, except 

that people who like hip-
hop seem to either hate it 
or love it. 

With the help of a 
Roland Me-50S 
Groovebox and stylistic 
nods to bhangra and dance 
hall, Maya Arulpragasam, a 
Sri-Lankan Londoner, 
combined garage with club 
and dance-hall stylings to 
become the darling of crit-
ics and clubbers world-
wide. 

Art/lor is M.1.A.'s debut 
album, memorable for its 
infectious chants and 
uncompromising electro-
beats, which sound like 
'Fruity Loops amples but 
groove assuredly while the 
bass hits with a fury distilled 
directly from the dance 
floor. 'S ingle "Galang," is 
first (0 hi t the streets, com-
bining spare electronic 
noise wi th sexy dance-hall

JennHer Lopez 
Rebirth 

Epic 

** 

Hollywood power player or not, it's not surpris-ing tharJennifer Lopez 
is releasing a comeback 
album. You didn't have to 
see "Gigli" or watch 
"Extra" last year (0 under-
stand why her label wanted 
to call her new album 
Rebhth. 

But even if Epic knows 
why we're sick of her, JLo 
still has no clue. The video 
for the first single (Lopez 
plays every character while 
watching herself on dozens 
ofTVs) fails to wi n her any 
much-needed modesty 

points. 
The song itself, "Get 

Right," is a good idea gone 
bad . The jazz element 
almost works, except that 
repeating 2-second sax 
whine will have you jump-
ing up (0 fix the skip in 
your radio. 

Lopez will always be 
perceived as a media 
mogul , which is why her 
attempts to sell herself as a 
sex kitten don't take in the 
slinky Beyonce-style "Step 
Into My World." Things 
get uglier when she releases 
her inner drama queen: 
"(Can 't Believe) This is 
Me" 'ounds like a rejected 
Spanish soap theme. 

Since wc do, however 
unfairly, know so much 
about Lopez's love life, 
most of her lyrics on 
Rebirth simply don't work. 
Could she actually be talk-
ing to brand new hubby 
Marc Anthony when she 
croons " I can't believe 
you're still mine, that's 
crazy"? On second 
thought, maybe she 's talk-
ing to her fans.

Punk-rock jesters play the clasSics 
Me First and the Gimme Gimmes a silly side project for respected rockers 

By CODY NABOURS 
Staff Writer 

When a genre of music boils irs all -roo-formulaic style down to covers of once-popular 
karaoke barnburners, you know it 
has popped its clogs and joined the 
pop culture limbo of YH1 summer 
programming. Take as an example 
punk rock, and the albums of Me 
First and the Gimme Gimmes, who 
take on such shitheel songwriters as 
John Denver, Neil Diamond, 
Andrew Lloyd Webber, Bernie 
Taupin and whoever wrote songs for 
Styx, with the fast/loud modus 
operandi of punk music 

Wait, damn it! Punk's not dead l 
Don't listen to the naysayers, for Me 
First and the Gimme Gimmes, Fat 
Wreck C hords' all -star cover band, 
represent the very lifeblood of punk 
music, in all of its epicurean glory. 
Including members of NOFX (Fat 
Mike), Lagwagon Goey Cape, Dave 
Raun) , No Use For A Name (Chris 
Shiflett) and Swingin' Utters (Spike 
Slawson), the Gimmes inject the 
pure power-chord attack of new-
school punk into well-established, 
well-loved-by-the-masses singles 
collected from singer-songwriter 
types, Broadway musicals, R&B hit-
makers and classic-rock radio. 

The Ginmles began in 1996 as 
members of the separate bands came 
together ro record covers for various 
Plmk-O -Roma-style compilations, 
but through a series of singles, they 
soon beca me an entity separate from 
their respective "serious" bands. In 
1997, they released their first full-
length album, H IlUC a Ball, a collec-
tion of songs from the likes of Paul 
Simon ("Me and Julio Down by the 
Schoolyard,,), James Taylor ("Fire

Cover comedy: Known for poking fun at Broadway musicals, R&B and rock 
singles, Me First and the Gimme Gimmes will play at Price Center on March 11. 
and Rain") and John D enver 
("Leaving on aJet Plane"). The crew 
blasts through the A.M. hits in such 
a fun-loving, energetic fashion that 
many of the songs sound even better 
to the ears of Generation Y punk 
revivalists than the limp but famous 
originals. T heir next album, 1999's 
Are a Drag, showcased songs culled 
from Broadway musicals that are 
recognizable to even the most ardent 
show-rune opponents. 1\ventieth-
century standards such as "My 
Favorite 'Things," "Don't Cry For 
Me Argentina," "Summertime" and 
"Over the Rainbow" were given the 
power-chord rreaonent for an album 
as consistendy enjoyable as any of 
the Gimmes' AM.-radio hit covers. 

B/uw in tbe WInd followed in 
200 1, featuring some of the best 
interpretations of their career. With 
a take on music of the '60s, includ-
ing Bob Dylan's " Blowin' in the 
Wind," Del Shannons "Runaway" 
and some gi rl -group oldies, t he 

group reached new heights of 
ridiculousness and hilarity, master-
ing such time-honored traditions as 
the ridiculous guitar solo, the four-
part vocal harmony, the spoken 
word interlude (UTo the library! '') 
and the always classic "no-longer-
than-three-minutes" attack. For 
any listener of Fat Wreck Chords 
punk reviva l, this is the classic 
Gimmes album, containing bonus 
intro segments taken from such 
seminal punk songs as the Clash's 
"Lo nd on Calling" and the 
Ramones' "Teenage Lobotomy" to 
reward those in the know with even 
more hilarity. By 2003 's Tala a 
Brfali, which collected R& B classics 
from Michael Jackson, Lionel 
Ritchie, Prince and others, and 
2004's Ruin Jonny's Bar Mitzvah, a 
live show at a Malibu bar mitzvah, 
the Gimmes full y developed the 
expertly fun-loving style of Blaw i1l

Boyle: 'The more popular a film 
is, the less you feel connected to it' 

continued from page 9 
ing because we were sat at the back 
and couldn't see anything. It felt 
like it hadn't really started, and 
then it was five hours later and it 
was over. We didn't win, of course, 
but if you do get an award I imag-
ine it's a pretty great experience. 

Do you have a pick for best 
picture? 

I've seen "The Aviator" and I 
loved watching it. I'm a big fan of 
Leo, and obviously Scorsese is a 
huge inspiration. I don 't think 
there's anybody out there making 
films that he hasn't played a big 
part in your life as a filmmaker. My 
favorite film of la st year was 
"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless 
Mind." I really loved it. 

It's almost 10 years after 
"Trainspotting" now. Do you get 
sick of people asking you about it? 

Well, it's very gratifying that 
people love it so much. You don't 
feel connected to it in the same way 
because, it's funny, the more popu-
lar the films are, the less you feel 
connected to them. People know 

more about it than I do! The ones 
that nobody goes to see - they're 
the ones you cherish really. But it's 
really nice that people love 
"Trainspotting." We've got a long-
term plan to do a sort of sequel to 
it, not an easy cash-in sequel; it's a 
sequel based on those sa me charac-
ters when they hit middle age. We 
want the actors to have hit middle 
age as well. It would be this group 
of hedonists who've abused them-
selves so long and what they do 
about that stage of thei r life. Those 
characters really have a hold over 
people. People sti ll remember 
them very vividly. 

Although the main characters 
are kids, "Millions" is adult in a 
lot of ways. Do you have a target 
audience for that movie? 

It's like anybody who's got a 
monl, really. But it's not a kid's film. 
It's more for people looking back at 
when you were a kid. You hope 
your films appeal to everyone. Even 
if they're a bit too violent for peo-
ple or too scary, you try and exclude 
no one.

odd year when San Diego sta rts 
looking like Seattle. 

So what options are left for a 
club sport like ultimate when it is 
slated to host more than 30 teams 
on a rainy weekend? The sensible 
answer is to send them to other 
fields nearby and let the tourna-
ment go on as smoothly as possible . 

Club sports director Scott 
Berndes was aware that other teams 
were being advised to find local 
fields on which to play, but didn 't 
vocally reject the idea until after 
complaints were filed regarding the 
use and damage of both private and 
public fields. There was no reason 
for him to do so. Ultimately, to 
Berndes' credit, he backed the team 

by representing it on behalf of 
UCSD Sports Clubs and softened 
what could have been a much more 
debilitating blow to the organiza-
tion. 

Another question that is raised 
by the Prez Day Tournament can-
cellation is one that appeals to all 
field-usng club sports and the sway 
(or lack thereof) that these teams 
have in matters of field closures. 

A common C0I11plaint lodged by 
athletes from a number of club 
sports teams is the school 's reluc-
tance to cancel a varsi ty match com-
pared to the ready willingness with 
which a club sport match is called . 

Regardless of which tcams are 
receiving fiscal support, these are 
the same fields, and they should 

therefore be treated with equal dis-
cretion. 

I'm not going to say that fall soc-
cer matches should be postponed the 
next time it drizzles, but the thresh-
old for what qualifies as potentially 
damaging for fields needs to be com-
mon, and once it is crossed, there has 
to be a local alternative. 

The bottom line is that the pun-
ishment is unsuited for the offense. 
These guys are not criminals; they 
are athletes who were trying to 
facilitate a significant number of 
other athletes when nature inter-
fered with their plans. There is no 
reason for college students who are 
only guilty of wanting to play their 
sport in the rain to have to account 
for campus inadequacies.

ninth when the Norse scored to 
make it 4-2, with two outs and run-
ners a t the corners. However, 
Lipetz came through for the 
Tritons to earn his first save of the 
season. 

In the 6-4 loss to Northern 
Kentucky on March 7, the Norse 
scored six runs in the third inning, 
including back-to-back home runs, 
giving themselves a 6-1 advantage. 
The loss went to junior Rya n 
Leake, usually a closer, who 
pitched three opening innings.

errors, lit up the scoreboa rd with 
three runs in the fifth, two in the

THURSDAY, MARCH 10,2005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

·Tennis: Tritons' success starts with 'stellar doubles 
continued from page ,6 

dominated. The Tritons jumped 
out to an early 3-0 lead with 
straight wins across the doubles 
line-up. Molden and Spector 
defeated their opponents, 8-5, at 
No. I doubles, while Swatt and 
Rubens, playing No. 2 doubles, 
gave up only one game in their 8-
1 victory. Oijala and Meister then 
defeated Brett Womack and Mario 
Pineda, 8-3, to close out the dou-
bles lineup. 

The singles lineup had Ii ttle 
trouble defeating opponents across 
the board. Spector highlighted the 
match with a comeback win. After 
winning the first set, 6-2, and los-
ing the second, 4-6, he came back 
to win the third in a tiebreaker, 10-
3. 

"We have a really solid, deep 
lineup until our sixth SPOt," Oijala 
said. "Doubl es has been key for us 
this season; when we sweep teams 
in doubles or have a lead, it sets the 
tone for the whole match." 

The Tritons have been doing 
better than expected ; with such a 
young team, the season began 
with an aura of uncertainry. 

" Eric [Steidl mayer, the men's 
coach] has done a great job 
putting everyone together," Oijala 
said. "I have been amazed at how 
well everyone has come together 
into a really solid team. This 
could possibly be one of the best 
recruiting classes ." 

On March 3, the Tritons sent 
lhree doubles earns to begin day 
one of the 11 6th Annual Pacific 
Coast Doubles Championships at 
the La Jolla Beach and Tennis 
Club. 

The tournament, which consist-
ed of 128 independent doubles 
teams, was a good indicator for the 
Tritons as to the competition level 
of Division I play. Top-ranked 
teams including Stanford and USC 

came to compete for bragging 
rights in the four-day, high-caliber 
tournament, despite the warning of 
rain. 

On day one of the tournament, 
Oijala and Meister came out victo-
rious in a 7-6, 6-1 battle against 
Lefi Nordlund and David Johnson, 
while UCSD's second team, con-
sisting of Rubens and Spector, was 
handed an early tournament loss by 
Trent Miller and Derek Miller, 7-6 
(5), 6-1. 

Duo Molden and Swatt, who 
won the Intercollegiate Tennis 
Association West Regional 
Doubles Championsnip on Oct. I, 
were placed at the No. 9 seed and 
received a bye on March 1. 

By March 2, the second day of 
competition, Meister and Oijala 
earned a tough match against No. I 
seed Sam Warburg and K.c. 
Corkery of Stanford after an 
impressive win the day before 
against the reigning doubles 
National Champions. However, 
the duo was unable to hold their 
ground and lost, 6-0, 6-2. 

"We really had nothing to lose 
against [Warburg and Corkery], so 
we gave it all," Oijala said. "It was 
definitely a fun tournament." 

Swart and Molden were unable 
to fare better, and lost In a very 
close match to Kevin Borzenski 
and Richard Johnson of Stanford, 
3-6,6-2, 10-8, sending them to the 
consolation bracket. With the 
onset of rain, Rubens and Spector 
were forced to hold off their match 
until day three of the competition. 

March 5 saw Swan and Molden 
begin the day with two victories, 8-
5 and 8-6, in the fourth round and 
quarterfinals, respectively. The duo 
then advanced to the consolation 
bracket semifinals, where they 
faced the unaffiliated Ken 
Nakahara and John Pettit and lost 
in a close three-set match, 6-1, 2-6, 

Greg DaIejCuor6on 
Upset: Junior Brent Molden (above) 
and sophomore Seth Spector beat their 
No.2 doubles opponent on March B . 
2-6. 

UCSD's other doubles pair of 
Rubens and Spector swept through 
their postponed match with a close 
victory over Antonio Aniello and 
J ames Holland, 9-8, in the third 
round of the consolation bracket, 
but then lost in the next round to 
Tyler Browne and Rofelio 
Hernandez, 9-7, ending their run 
in the tournament. 

The Tritons face a difficult 
schedule going into spring break. 
On March 21, they will face No. 12 
Drury University of Springfield, 
Mo., then over the course of the 
next week, they will face five tough 
teams including West Florida, 
Southwest Baptist and Western 
New Mexico. 

"We're just going to take one 
match at a time, go out and play 
our game," Spector said. "Anything 
can happen. We just need to go out 
there and fight, and hope things go 
our way."

Softball drops first 
doubleheader to SFSU 

By MICHAEL SCHOECK 
Senior Staff Writer 

Prospects for Triton domi-
nance in the California Collegiatt! 
Athletic Association were dashed 
when the Triton softball team was 
defeated in its first doubleheader 
sweep of the 2005 season, falling 
by scores of 2-1 and 6-0 on March 
6 to San Francisco State. 

Tilt: pair of horne-game losses 
bumped UCSD's record to 7-5 
overall and 4-2 in CCAA play. 

The Tritons tied the game at 
one in the bottom of the first 
inning, but despite the fact that 
several players performed well, 
San Francisco State's victory was 
secure by the fifth inning. 

"The first game was well -
played, but we didn 't get the hits 
at the right time and we got very 
defensive," senior team captain 
Jamie Hurst said . 

Sophomore Brittni Carino had 
a hit and scored a run in the first 
game, while I Tum also collected a 
hit to go along with her RBI. 

Fre hman Danielle Lukic had 
the other UCSD hit in game one, 
scoring on Hurst's RBI single. 

Sophomore Melanie Meurer 
and Junior iki Anderson each 
collected a hit in the second game 
of the twin bill . 

Sophomore Tina Rowe suf-
ered the loss in game one for 
tJC 0 , despite allowing only one 
earned run on fi ve hits with two 
walks and five strikeouts. 

Freshman Melissa Ward rook 
the loss in game two, allowing 
four earned runs on 10 hits in six 
full innings of work. 

"[Freshman] Nicole Fullerton 
came in at the rop of the seventh 
inning with bases loaded and did 
an awesome job," Hurst aid. 

As for the visiting San 

Francisco State team, junior 
pitcher Sonja Garnett played out-
standing, throwing two complete 
games and improving to 9-2 on 
the season. 

"We struggled with Garnett 
for a long time," Hurst said. 

Garnett allowed only one run 
on three hits in game one, while in 
game two she completely domi-
nated the Tritons, tossing the 
shutout while allowing only two 
hits and facing the minimum 
number of batter in the nightcap. 

She struck out three in both 
contests, shutting down the Triton 
attempts to recover lost ground. 

San Francisco State's victory 
translates to a CCAA record 
improvement to 11 -7 overall and 
6-2 in league action. 

UCSD returns to action next 
week with a pair of doubleheaders 
at home. The Tritons Will host 
Cal Baptist in a nonconference 
matchup on March 10. UCSD 
will then host Cal State San 
Bernardino on March 12.

No. 10 men's tennis beats 
Presbyterian College 

Tritons sweep doubles in their 
sixth straight win of the season 

By ANGELA UN 
Senior Staff Writer 

Before emerging from the 
shadow of a memorable 2004 sea-
son that included a run to the 
NCAA Division II 
Championship, there were doubts 
hanging over the fate of this year's 
UCSD men's tennis team. How 
was the team going to recover 
after the graduation of six 
seniors? Would the two returning 
starters be able to carry the team? 
Would the four freshmen stand 
up against collegiate competi-
tion' The Tritons have si lenced 
any doubters and are nipping at 
the heels of their predecessors. 

The No. 10 Tritons (6-1 over-
all) extended their six-match win-
ning streak on March 8 with a 6-
3 win over No. 20 Presbyerian 
College. It was the first time the 
Tritons hosted a match against 
another nationally ranked team, 
and they rose to the performance 
with little problem. 

"We knew going into the 
match that it was going to be 
important because it was a 
Division II match, which is used 
later on to determine our playoff 
status," junior Erk Oijala said. 
"We came out mentally prepared 
and ready." 

The Tritons pounced on the 
Blue Hose early in the match, 
winning all three of their doubles 
matches. Sophomore Seth 
Spector and junior Brent Molden 
surpa sed every skeptic's expecta-
tions by defeating the nation's 
No. 2 doubles team, Paul 
Ratchford and Kshitij Dwivedi, 8-
6, in an exciting match. 

"We went into the match not 
trying to think about it too 
much," Spector said. "We just 
went out there and gave it our 
best shot - on any given day any-
thing can happen." 

At No. 2 doubles, senior 
Bryan Swatt and freshman Eric 
Rubens defeated their opponents 
in a quick 8-2 match, while Oijala 
and freshman Blake Mesiter 
defeated Hector Rincon and Zach 
Glankler, 8-5, at No.3 doubles. 

The Tritons have been con-
centrating on perfecting their 
doubles game plan and lineup, 
and their hard work has become a 
powerful advantage in getting the 
early lead in matches. Of 21 dou-
bles matches played this season, 
the men have only dropped five, 
which has helped them obtain 
their impressive record thus far. 

The men began the singles 
play with a 3-0 lead. At No. 1 sin-
gles, Swan had little trouble 
defeating Ratchford, 6-2, 6-4, but 
the three los es came at the 0.2, 
No. 3 and No.4 singles positions. 
Oijala, playing No.4 singles, was 
able ro pull the first set from his 
opponent, 6-1, but was unable to 
maintain control, and lost the 
next two sets, 3-6,4-6, in a tough 
three-set match . At o. 5, 
Mei ter defeated Glankler, 6-1, 7-
6, while freshman Will Phan, at 

o. 6 singles, picked up an easy 
win over Guy Dooley, 6-2, 6-2. 

The win came a day after an 
easy home victory over Division 
I Gonzaga on Feb. 7. The 
Tritons swept the Bulldogs, 9-0, 
in a match that the men simply

Squids face 
• • mappropnate 
punishment 

Granted ... 
Matthew Grant 

Wen members of the UCSD men's ultimate team were informed that 
the Prez Day Tournament - the 
biggest annual event of its kind west 
of the Mississippi - would be can-
celed on account of water-logged 
fields, none expected ro find the 
team suffering consequences 
through March of 2006. Who 
would? 

But that is the situation now fac-
ing the Squids, who are currently 
serving the last week of a three-
week ban on all practice and playas 
a result of incidents that unfolded 
between Feb. 19 and Feb . 2 1. 
Meanwhile, team captains and the 
tournament director also have to 
start pulling together funds to inde-
pendently payoff thousands of dol-
lars in damages to privately owned 
fields that were apparently 
destroyed by irresponsible use. 

A little background: The Prez 
Day Tournament is the ultimate 
team's annual competition for the 
be t qualifying teams from around 
the country to come rogether and 
vie for a championship. Typically, at 
this time of year, San Diego is the 
ideal location for teams that are 
stuck in colder climates to put on 
some shorts and play in our fair 
weather. In case you hadn't noticed 
already, this is not a typical year in 
San Diego. 

Regardless, the tournament was 
planned months in advance to allow 
teams to compete in qualifying 
rounds and plan their trips. Because 
ultimate is not an CAA-sanc-
tioned sport, very few schools are 
willing to put forth money for these 
athletes, and the players must pay 
for their own travel expenses and 
accommoda tions. This is the case 
with all club sportS. 

So, when rain led to the untime-
ly closure of all of UCSD's many 
fi elds over the holiday weekend, 
there was a large number of people 
still anxious to play -literally hun-
dreds of them. 

At the time, the rational conclu-
sion was to direct those teams that 
wanted to throw a disc around to 
other local fields until a better solu-
tion could be reached . In retro-
spect, this decision may have been 
short-sighted. However, it is the 
only thing that the Squids are 
directly accountable for, despite the 
severity of their punishment. 

UCSD's outdoor field-using 
teams have a problem that requires 
attention, or this will not be the last 
time we are faced with a conun-
drum like the one affecting the ulti -
mate team. The campus practically 
has more grass fields than there are 
sports to use them - until it rains. 
Then there are none. There is not a 
single all-weather field where teams 
can relocate matches that are other-
wise called on account of weather. 

There is a degree of logic at 
work here . Because they are located 
in a generally a dry place, the fields 
at UCSD are designed to work like 
sponges, collecting as much water 
as possible from each rain, then 
irrigating the grass more efficiently 
than constant watering could. But 
that leaves no alternatives for the
