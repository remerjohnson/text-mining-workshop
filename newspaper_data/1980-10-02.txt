T opkis Picks Wheeler for 
AS VP, Council Confinns

AS Also Considers KSDT Contract, Reg Fee 
BY DEAN HAAS 

Warren Wheeler . Asso-
ciated Students Commissioner 
of External Affairs , was 
appointed AS Vice President 
last night by the AS Council. 

Only half the council voted 
in favor of Wheeler, which 
followed the appointment of 
former Vice President Bill 
T opkis to the position of AS 
president. 

Several council members 
sharply criticized the 
procedure by which Wheeler 
was appointed, on the grounds 
that not enough notice of the 
vacancy wa$.. given to 
students. They also accused 
Topkis, who made the 
nomination , of not inter-
viewing enough candidates for 
the job. 

Calling the criticisms 
"untrue allegations," T opkis 
said he had chosen the best 
qualified candidate. 

However, T opkis said that 
few qualified students had 
applied for the position, and 
that he had been turned down 
by two candidates before 

selecting Wheeler. 
" I did speak to several AS 

Council members re~rding 
the appointment," Topkis 
said. "I picked the best person 
for you and for the students." 

Todd Thompson, AS 
Activity Fee Commissioner, 
said that some students were 
"discouraged" from applying 
for the position because "the 
decision had already been 
made." 

Earlier in the evening, Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Richard Armitage appeared 
before the Council to 
apologize for not consulting 
students over a proposal to 
change the structure of the 
Registration Fee Committee. 

Armitage admitted that the 
proposal was released 
without sufficient background 
information. 

"I have been at fault . .. the 
back-up and reasoning were 
not there .. .I deserve to be 
censured for it," Armitage 
said. 

committee. 
The Council passed a 

resolution late in the evening 
condemning Armitage for his 
actions and demanded him to 
reinstate this year's Reg Fee 
Committee student members. 

The resolution , co-authored 
by five Council members, also 
demands that Armitage 
"publicly state that the draft 
document is not a workin" 
paper and has been rejected. ' 

It further calls for the 
formation of a committee to 
investigate the Reg Fee 
Committee by-laws, in 
addition to the ratification by 
student groups of any 
proposed changes in the 
committee. 

Indochinese Internshig _Pr~grain 
The proposal eliminates the 

right of students to appoint 
representatives to the 
committee in addition to other 
reduction in student authority 
on the committee. Successful After First Year 

BY RANDY HIU. 
Studenta who are winding 

up a year working with 
Indochinese refugees in a 
federally funded program say 
their work was hard, but 
worthwhile. 

UCSD admini.trators 
cOMeCted with the program, 
called the University Year for 
ACTION (the federal 
umbrella grou~ for the Peace 
Corps and VISTA), say the 
studenta did "an excellent 
job." 

The program, funded with 
$360,000 in federal money, 
took place Qn the UC 
cam.,... in San Diego, Los 
Anplea and Irvine. In all three 
locations, per.on. involved 

with the prog_ram are 
evaluating ita effectivenea., 
both for the refugee 
community and for the 
students who .erved a. 
intern •. 

Twenty·one UCSD .tu-
denta, under the auspices of 
the Warren College Intern.hip 
Program, began last January 
to work 24 to 30 hours a week 
in two San Diego-ba.ed Social 
Service agencies. 1heir job: to 
aid in the resettling of 
Indochine.e refugee. in the 
San Diego area by providing 
services in language training, 
consumer/legal counseling, 
home management, health 
care, citizenship preparation 
and community development. 

Fall Quarter Schedule 
Hits Thanksgiving 

BY JACK DANIELS 
Students who look forward 

to Thanksgiving as a time of 
gastronomic exercise may find 
their dreams of roast turkey, 
stuffing and cranberry sauce 
spoiled this year by the fact 
that the holiday falls between 
the last day of fall quarter 
classes and the first day of 
finals. 

However, those who are not 

used to juggling textbooks, 
class notes and drumsticks 
should not feel overly 
frustrated with this schedule. 
According to UCSD Registrar 
Ronald Bowker, this setup is 
the "least objectionable" of the 
alternatives that faced him and 
his staff when they planned the 
fall 1980 quarter. 

Working under guidelines 
set up b}' UC President David 
Saxon, Bowker had the option 
of startinj instruction at 
UCSD on Sept. 15,22 or 29. 
Many of the other campuses in 
the UC system had similar 
dates from which to choose. 

Sept. 15 was not chosen 
p/e"ufum to page 6 

At the same time, the 
interns received four unita of 
academic credit for doing 
rlsearch and writing a paper 
on their ob.ervations and data 
collection concerning the 
resettlement and its impact on 
the refugees. 

Also, the interns have 
attended a weekly seminar 
under the auspice. of the 
anthropology, sociology and 

~litical science departments. 
The seminar has run since last 
winter, taught by anthropo-
logy graduate student Bruce 
Harris. ,

'The Knoll' Preserved 
The university has 

decided to ask the Regents 
to declare an area next to 
La Jolla Farms an area 
valuable to historical and 
scientific research, and 
therefore undevelopable. 

The estimate of the value 
on the land known as "the 
Knoll," is $10 million. 

Systemwide administra-
tion has been pressuring 

campuses to sell valuable 
land to help alleviate UC 
budRet problems. 

The farms area, campus 
planners have said, will 
probably be sold to 
developers. The AS, 
administrators and faculty 
have been arguing for over 
a year, however, on 
specifically who the land 
should be sold to.

History 
Editor 

the French IflCtion 01 the 
Literature Department would 
like to explain the changes 
which have occurred and 
lOme 01 the reuona for them. 

At the dote of apring 
quarter la.t year, the 
Linlui.tic. Department 
announced fundamental 
alteration. in ita French 
Language Program: French 5 
and 6 were 8boIiahed, and 
French 4 was henceforth to be 
offered only once a year 
during apring quarter. 

The effect of these changes 

was to oblige the Literature 
Department to reorient the 
focus 01 the couraes in the 
lequence Lit/French 10·25· 
50. These couraea had to be 
able to re.pond to the 
demands 01 atudenta corning 
from the Linguatica Depart· 
ment and offer a logical .tep 
beyond the Language 
Pr~am. 

The French Literature 
lequence, as we have revised 
it now, forms a coherent unit, 
propeing from 10 to SO. 
LitiF rench 10 poovidea an 
intemive review of French 
grammar accompanied by 
writing practice and cUcunion 
of literary texta. In Lit/French 
25, grammar review i.1eu the 
focus and the practice of 
French i. emphasized through 
composition and diacus.ion of 
abort .tories. Lit/French 50 ia 

uniquely a CQurse in French 
Literature which initiates the 
student to the techniques of 
literary anaIy.il. 

Since the element which 
mo.t · readily di.tingui.he • 
each coone i. its relative 

' ernphaai. on a review of 
French grammar, it i. 
appropriate to administer a 

~st to determine the .tudent'. 
auimilation 9f this material 
and to indicate the course best 
suited to the .tudent'. need •• 
No test of this sort i. infallible, 
and we know that, for lOme 
.tudents, thi. test will not 
nmction as an accurate tool for 
p1acemenl 'These cases are 
di.culled and re.olved 
individually by the .tudent and 
the faculty member. 

No student was nor will be 
forced to take a coone which 
he or she does not want to 

take. (It .hould be noted that 
the author of Ja.t Friday'. 
article i., in fact, enrolled in 
Lit/French 50, the course for 
which he had initially 
regi.tered, and that he was not 
forced to take Lit/French 10 
u the article impliea.) 

A student, however, will be 
encourqed to register for 
whatever course best responds 
to hi. or her particular needs. 
Moreover, the French aection 
hopes that each .tudent will 
discuss hi. or her aituation with 
the appropriate faculty 
member. We remain 
accellaible to the .tudenta not 
only at the beginning of the 
quarter, but throughout the 
year a. well.

Editor: 
I am constantly amused by 

the _ iBnorance demonstrated 
by UCSD atudenta when it 
comes to Chri.tianity. I'm not 
aayi", these atudenta are 
.tupid. No, they are very 
intellitent. However they are 
ignorant...isnorant of the 
Bible, of hi. tory , of 
archeology, of lCience and of 
philosophy. 

A case in point i. the recent 
letter by Casey Hopaon (Dol'" 
Guardian, Sept. 29). Anyone 
who call. the Bible "a 
chauvini.tic, fooli.h and 
~erous work of mytho· 
logy' ia simply unaware of the 
facta. 

First, there hal never been 
one archeological find that 
contradicta any part of the 
Bible. In fact, the Bible has 

often been used .. a re.ource 
book to give direction to 
archeological research. 

Second, there i. more 
historical and legal evidence to 
.upport the fact of the 
resurrection of Jesua Chri.t 
from the dead than evidence to 
IUpport the common idea that 
Napoleon was defeated at 
Waterloo. 

Hop.on'. analy.i. of 
Romans 13:2-4 i. another 
interesting point. I would agree 
with Hopson if I were to ignore 
the buic principlea of literary 
interpretation. 

First and foremo.t, j mu.t 
con.ider the context of 
chapter. 12, 13 and 14, the 
context of the whole letter of 
Roman. and the context of the 
entire Bible. I don't believe 
Hop.on . took the time 

necesaary to do this, or the 
application of the veraes would 
have been con.iderably 
diHerent. 

It'. important to note that 
UCSD .tudents receive little or 
no trainins in Biblical .tudy, 
and the little training lOme 
atudents receive cornea from a . 
poIition that question. the 
credibility of Christianity. 

For example, a Revelle 
humanities sequence .tudies 
"aa1vation" and the faD quarter 
i. set to .tudy the Bible. 
Several of the texta they Ute 
are written by humani.tic and 
exi.tential philo.ophers. 
Where are the reading. written 
br .. the church fathers? These 
philolOpher. are fundamen· 
tally anti.Chri.tian, yet the 
remaining two quarters 
approach their view. of 
" .. Ivation" much diHerently. 
The authora used are "pro" 
whatever concept the c1au is 
·studying. There i. a ba.ic 
contradiction of the education 
procell here to not give all 
ideological position. equal 
empha.i •. 

It i. also important to note 
that the areater number of 
UCSD .tudenta who criticize 
Chri.tianity will spend an hour 
writing a letter to the editor 
about some complaint. On the 
other hand most will not apend 
the tame amount 01 time 
researchirw and lr>'inI to 
understand" what the Bible'. 
meuqe truly ia. 

Perhapa there are lOme who 

do want to take time to get a 
balanced· view of Chri.tianity. 
I am available to talk if you are 
interested. Leave a not for me 
at the Campus Cruaade for 
Chri.t mailbox in the .tudent 
organizations office. I hope to 
hear from many .tudents ... 
and I hope Casey Hopson i. 
one I hear from soon.

call to pick a third girl up. 

In order to run the voluntary

year. The budget covers

On an averAJe night, three 
to four call. will come in with 
requesb .lackening off during 
the weekend •. After the .ixth 
day of operation thi. ),f'.ar, 
fourteen call. have been 
received by the organization. 

Occaaionally, the escort 
eervice hat had prank phone 
call. from students asking 
about "dates." The escorb 
interviewed wi.hed to 

emphasize that their escort 
organization i. not a dating 
service. TIle phone number for 
anyone wishing to use Joe's 
Escort Service is 455·JOES. 

Going out on a call i. 
described by one escort as "a 
good study break." The escort 
service has been given many 
compliments from girls who 
have been escorted. 

"Usually, the escorted is 
intrigued by the idea and

continued from plJ#1e 1 
because it was fdt that the 
majority of students would 
dislike .uch an early start. 
Beginning instruction on this 
day would also cause the week 
of final exams to be interrupted 
by the Thanksgiving break. 

The Sept. 29 option was 
also dropped because such a 
late slart would re.ult in final.

week of December, thus

students have off during the 
Christmas holidays. 

"We have a1w~s wanted to 
give students the longest 
pos.ible Christmas vacation," 
says Bowker, adding that a 
number of students must work 
over the four week break and 
need time to look for 
temporary employment. 

Consequently, instruction 
for the Fall quarter began on 
Sept. 22. UC Berkdey also 
aIarIed classes on this date, 
whereas the campuses at 
River.ide, Irvine, Santa 
Barbara and Los Angele. 
chose to wait until Sept. 29 to 
open their doors. 

So far the Registrar's office 
has not received any 
complaints from students who 
would rather .pend lhanks· 
giving with their families 
instead of their notebooks. 

"I would think that the 
majority of students would 
prefer this schedule," states 
Bowker, adding that the other 
alternatives would have only 
made the situation "much 
worse." 

Shapiro 
Is Halted 

For 150 UCSD political 
science students, the Paci~c 
Southwest Airlines pilots' 
strike is more than iust a labor 
dispute in the headlines. 

The strike will prevent 
Martin Shapiro. who helped 
found the UCSD Political 
Science Department and now 
teaches at the Boult School of 
Law at UC Berkeley, from 
flying down to San Diego each 
Monday and teaching his 
popular course on the 

Su~reme Court. 
The class wm continue, 

however. Another Berkeley 
professor, Tom Cordi, will 
assume the weekly lectures, 
now set for Mondays from 4· 7 
pm. If the strike ends, Shapiro 
may fly down to guest·lecture 
during the quarter . 

According to a department 
spokeswoman, no one has 
dropped the class, and she 
says students are taking a 
"wait and see" attitude.

One .tudent, when asked 
whether the program was 
worthwhile enough to justify 
the bureaucratic h.llies and 
making .uch • major 
commitment, .. ya, "Some· 
thing can be a good experience 
without being beneficial 
financially. " 

UCSD will not ask for more 
fml1l for 1981. However, 
Gc.don notes, .he would be 
intere.ted in future limilar 
program. on a more muted 
nature.

Senate Report: 
Billy Carter 

WASHINGTON AP 
Senate investigators are 
releasing their report on Billy 
Carter's Libyan ties amid 
lingering questions about 
White House involvement and 
whether the President 's 
brother " merits condem· 
nation." 

Th e s pe c ial Sena t e 
subcommittee, which began its 
probe of the Billy Carter· 
Libyan affair two months ago, 
was debating the report's 
conclusions yesterday. It is 
under Senate mandate to 
release at least a tentative 
report by Oct. 4, a month to 
the day before the November 
election. 

At least six of the nine 
senators on the panel have 
written separa te views to add 
to the report, and one of the~ , 
Sen. Bob Dole, R.Kan., Said, 
" I still have grave reservations 
and doubts about President 
Carter's role in this matter." 

Severa senators were trying 
to restore language deleted 
from a draft report saying Billy 
Carter 's conduct " merits 
condemnation because it was 
contrary to the interests of the 
President and the United 
States." 

The draft also criticized the 
President ·and several top 
aides for poor judgment and 
mishandlin& of the affair but 
said Billy Carter received no 
special treatment as the 
President's brother.

Erratum: 
In yesterday's Daily

of the campus Affirmative 
Action Office. Instead, 
Watson is an advisor to the 
chancellor on campus matters 
concerning Affirmative
