513 . Iranians In State 
Could Be Deported 

Financial Aid Cutoff Suit Pressed 
SAN DIEGO (AP) -Immigration 

oHiciais said yesterday at least 513 
Iranian students in. , California have 
irregularities in their visas which could 
lead to- deportation, but lOme Iranians 
are seeking political asylum here. 

As deportation proceedings 
continued, a lawsuit seeking to halt an 
allegedy $13 million educational free 
ride for Iranian students in the state 
was filed Wednesday in Orange 
County Superior Court by state Sen. 
John Briggs. 

In Loa Angeles and here, federal 
Immigration and Naturalization 
Service officials said, lOme deportation 
hearings were under way, but no actual 
deportations could be confirmed. 

Loa Angeles INS acting district 
director Orville Charles said the 
proceedings were. in accord with 
President Carter's order to expedite the 
hearings on Iranian students after they 
held demonstrations in the United 

,States supporting the takeover 01 the 
U.S. Embaaay in Iran. 

Charles said lOme students told 
agents they planned to ask for asylum. 

"They said they feared they would 
be prosecuted if they returned to Iran," 
he said. 

Indicator Goes Hourly 

rn San Francisco, about 90 Iranian 
nationals appeared before 
administrative judges to receive 
hearing dates, and officials expected 
another 16 to appear for hearing dates 
Thursday. 

The Hourly Indicator has 
been posting hourly updates on 
the situation in Iran since the 

. fifth day of the crisis. 

Indicator collective member 
Sven Serrano. 

Thomas Laughlin, officer in charge 
of the INS for Sacramento, reported 
yesterday that 480 students had been 
interviewed 10 far, and 74 were found 
to be out of status. Taken from CBS Radio and

Number of Americans

By Jeff Beresford.Howe 
News Editor 

American writers are being published in 
China in rapidly increasing' numbers, but 
Arthur Hailey, GO!1e With the Wind and John 
Cheever dominate. . 

"There is quite a lot that is not so easy or 
accessible for' us , particularly those things 
involving sex, violence or homosexuality. If 
they're (in America), we should have them, but 
not too much," Chinese literary official and poet 
Bi Shuowang said in a lecture here last night. 

. "We do not take (much of what is published) 
very seriously." 

Bi is a director of the AlI·China Writers 
Auociation, former editor of a daily newspaper 
and former secretary to Chou En·Lai, late 
foreign minister of the People's Republic. 

The two decade freeze in US·China relations 
froze Chinese perception of American literature 
too. "Since the early fifties, we have had no 
regular communication with America, and so 
our understanding of American literature is 
limited. Our comrades in Taiwan have been 
more fortunate, so we have borrowed heavily 
from them."

"Under the gang, only one American work 

was published in China, Winds of War by 
Herman Wouk. I guess they could understand 
that." 

American literature will begin to flourish in 
the People's Republic, though . Party approval 
of foreign literature is no longer required, Bi 
said, and universities hope to use literature alt a 
tool in increasing Chinese·American friendship, 

Deng Shiao·Ping's modernizaton program'is 
also affecting the kind of literature seen in 
China. 

"We are seriously ~oin~ . the way of 
modernization," Bi said. "As we are getting 
mdustrialized, we will meet many of the 
questions Americans have found or face today. 
We ilope to understand the process and keep 
the good effects and not the evil.

could not 10 blithely toll off 
that phralle, nor could they 
have remained silent about his 
regime until now. 

Los Anlleles Times 
correspondent David Lamb, 
covering the trial of members 
of the Iranian secret police in 
Tehran, reported on June 22 
that they made "detailed 
confeliSions of how they 
tortured and murdered 
hundreds 01 Iranians in the 
name of the ruler and 
country." One of the poliCe 
agen"" "after describing how 
he Railed his victims with wire 
cables until their flesh peeled, 
told the court, ... .1 was just

normal duty to beat the 
prisoners with cables until they 

could walk no more. Many 
were made to walk by force, 
and if they were unable to, 
they were forced to move on 
their buttock., even if they had 
been beaten to the bone. 

'The prilOner. were not

testified. 'Often we would

would stick hot iron barli in 
their noses and eyes. And' we 
would tell the coroner to write

Political prisoners were

tied to bare electrified 
bedsprings where, unless they

the letters to the editor of the 
Times on Nov. 23 are any 
indication, many people are 
increasingly viewing the

the mah'. doctors as saying 
that the shah is not nearly as ill 
as reported. "I guess it is 
politically important that the 
shah appear to be dying, but 
that isn't so. When he came 
here, he was sick from 
gallstones," said one doctor. 
Breslin adds: "He also has 
lymphbma. He has had it for 
the past six or seven years: It is 
a low-level form of cancer. It 
did not stop him from skiiing or 
ruling a country." 

As for Khomeini , he has n?t

America Doesn't Need t·o Be Macho 
By Ma'rk William. 

Never in my life have I been so 
embarraued and 10 humiliated to be an 
American citizen. Sadly, we have J;erved to 
heap this humiliation upon ourselves. 

Mark Williom. is a UCSD underllrciduale. 
I...ut Wednesday I Itood on Revelle plaza 

and watched the Iranian rally. The students 
who were deJ1lOllstrating were not militant nQr 
even very provocative - indeed. they were 
aImoIt concitiatory. To quote: "The Iranian 
people hope to live in peace with the American 
people ... " 

In response 10 this gesture of reconciliation, 
I .. w my fellow American studenll treating 
the situation like a pep'rally. We Americana 
were reacting in such intelligent ways a. 
playing loud music to drown out the speaker!>, 
ha,.mg "funny" signs with vengeful sJogans 
from Blake Hall, yelling "Fuck you" and "Go 

H~," and in general proudly doing the 
Utmolt not to Iililen to all aide. of the is.ue. 
Any attempt to become infonned about the 
Iranian viewpoint was lost in a wave of fervent 
"patriotism" and hatred towards alliranian. 
and anyone even slightly resembling an 
Iranian. 

I do not support the Ayatollah Khomeini. I 
believe that the taking of hostages to force 
social change is wrong_ I believe that the 
United States might ultimately have to take 
unilateral action to retrieve the hostageli. But 
the Iranians have their side of the idue, and 
they have a valid ooint. The shah does not 
belong in the United States. While we should 
not submit to violent acts of kidnapping, we 
llhould not harbour suspected criminals from 
facing justice in their own nations, no matter 
what our opinionli of tho.e nations are. We 
have no right to interfere in the domestic issues 
01 foreign nations. 

But that is not the point. No matter how you 
all feel about the Iranian iSlue, all partieli 
involved have the right to express their own 
opinions. This ill my personal opinion, but it is 
one which I have come to individually and as a 
result of what I think is a cogent consideration 
of most of the issues. Most of the American 
students here have succumbed to emotionalist 
tendencies. I hear from many people that for 
the first time they are proud to be Americans. 
Do we have to portray a macho image in the 
world, advocating a violent and isolationitt 
course of action. do we have to be "tough

Our eyes met. His anger briefly subsided. The boos and hisses 
resounded all around as we stood there in silence looking at each

as he started shouting and making obscene gestures again. 

Wednesday's letter to the Editor in The Daily Guardian 
cri~cized Americana for being patriotic zealots and not attempt-
ing to understand the Iranian side. A blatant exhibition of blind 
patriotism was ha~ning on Revelle Plaza Wedllellday 
afternoon. People reinforced their ij{norance all they dosed 
their minds to what the rally speaker. were saying. What hurt me 
was to see my ow'll friends a part of this. . 

It might be difficult to Ii!>ten to individuals supporting a country

patriotic, adopt an "us against them," "America, love it or leave

. opinion, and that includes people here on visas. Rallys and 
protest marches don't have to come to violence if people avoid 
emotional reaction!>. 

In the midst of this political situation, I wonder if we're 
forgetting that we're dealing with people. On Wednesday people 
tried to explain how they viewed the Iranian situation. I watched 
al people met them with verbal insults and abusive signli and 
bannerll. I tistened as one perlOn, picking up the crowd's 
negative attitude, cried, "You're supposed to be intellectuals! 
You're acting with what you call blue collar mentality." Blue 
collar mentality; the short.ighted, tunnelvisioned. entllocentric 
thinking that stereotypifies bucolic America . Students ignoring 
and harraSling rally speakers and supporters exemplified thi. 
attitude. ~n people's emo~ons escalated and the momentum 
of the rally picked lIP with shouts of "Iranians go home" and 
"Deport the Shah." The more I watched, the more familiar face. 
I saw in the back of the crowd where mOllt of the anti-Iranian 
laction was. Looking at my friends, I wondered if they reall)' 
meant what they were saying, or il they had abandoned all 
rational beha vior in the fervor of the rTlpment. 

What'~ at isltue here is American attitudes towards US 
Iranian studenta. It's inane to hold them responsible for the 
American holtages because they support their country in

Proposition I requires 
Califomia courts in integration 
cases to follow federal 
a;tandards , which ha ve alro~ed 
bu~ing ofders only when 
segregation haa; been caused 
by deliberate actions of school 
districta . State standards 
previously required segrega-
tion to be ended regardless of 
cause. 

The lawsuit contends 
Proposition 1 is a deliberate 
act of segregation which 
viola tea; the U.S. Constitution. 
Defender. of the measure say 
it merely aligns the state with 

the federal Constitution. 
Though tbe measure's main 

goal was to end the year -ole 
court-ordered busing program 
in Los Angeles, the 
Sacramento suit hinges largely 
on another, more oba;cure 
integration order, a 1963 
ruling forbidding the rebuilding 
of a largely black junior high 
school that burned down and 
ordering its students integrated 
into other schools. 

A hearing on the suit is 
scheduled Dec. 7. The 
NAACP has filed a similar suit 
in federal court here, and a -
hearing is scheduled on

With God On His Side 
Dylan Still Belligerent 

By Barry AllOnlO 
Contributing Editor 

If a non-church-attending 
individual may be permitted to 
speak, I found "Born-Again" 
Chria;tian Bob Dylan 's 
Tuesday night concert at 
Golden Hall . offensive in a 
number of ways, including 
morally . My umbrage at the 
intolerent, aggressive'ly 
sanctimonious tone of the 
show comes not from my lack 
of ability to appreciate 
religiously inspired music -
far from it. However, 
intellectual smugness and 
musical banality are always 
irritating to me, no matter 
what their source. 

Criticizing songs rooted in 
any particular faith is difficult 
- for many , if the sentiments 
of a tune are religiously 
correct, the imagination and 
skill used to express them are 
only secondary. My spiritual 
beliefs aside, I refuse to put 
away my critical judgements 
of anyone's songs just because 
their themes are sanctified. To 
be specific: Dylan's recent 
Christian compositions betray 
a lyrical laziness and 
complacency, merely 
rehashing the homilies of 
countless earlier songs without 
adding anything new or 
valuable to the sacred music 
genre. 

Sure, I had my prejudices 
about Dylan's current material ' 
before attending his concert-
I can't say I found his latest 
Slow Train ComIng LP 
captiviit1ng entertainment. But 
I was willing to listen - and 
while his live show was 
performed with professional-
ism,l found little else that night . 

Custom

to be praiseworthy. 
In fact, the most satisfying, 

uplifting portion of the concert 
was the warm-up set by 
Dylan's three back-up women 
singers, a selection of bona-
fide gospel numbers full of 
warmth and personal joy. 
Unlike Dylan's accusatory 
fonn of hymn-writing, the 
songs performed by the 
opening trio expressed 
Christian love in gentle. 
generous terms. Traditional · 
black gospel, rather than 
proselytizing in .a finger-
pointing, accept-or-burn 
manner, invites the listener to 
believe with good humor and 
simple enthusiabm. For me at 
least, the spiritual level of the 
evening immediately dropped 
when Dylan appeared on 
stage and began to recite h~ 
self-righteous material. 

Christianity, like any faith , 
should be liberating, not 
restricting , to a creative artist. 
Just because a writer sees the 
world as adhering to a holr. 
plan doesn't mean he can t 
interpret life in his own terms, 
re-affirming traditional beliefs 
in a personal way . In the past , 
Dylan has done this - his 
John Wesley Harding LP 
( 1968) examined the world 
from an Old Testament 
perspective and did it with a 
surreal, startlingly imaginative 
touch . SUch Dylan songs as "I 
Shall Be Released" and "All 
Along The Watchtower" 
successfully capture the awe 
and spare beauty of the best 
spiritual music. Other pop 
music songwriters , including 
Laura Nyro, Andy Pratt and 
Patti Smith, have at various 
PQmts in their careers explored

Christian themes with 
individuality and power. I 
repeat, Christianity is more 
than fit subject matter for even 
rock music - but Dylan's 
latest offerings a re routine, 
undistinctive, a collection of 
cliches. I find them evidence of 
a great talent grown tired and 
complacent. 

Al> a stage presentation, 
Dylan and his band lacked the 
evangelical fire that could've 
made their songs more 
appealing. Made up of such 
well-known studio musicians 
as guitarist Fred Tackett and 
drummer Jim Keltner, the 
group executed its a rrange-
ments with precision and the 
songs were divided well 
between up-tempo numbers 
and ballads . But the overall 
sound was stiff, reflected in 
Dylan 's restraint from 
movement of stage and the

'Tree of Wooden Clogs' Tells ' 
Beautiful Tales of Peasants 

By Lynette Tom 
Senior Staff Writer 

It is no small wonder at a ll 
that The Tree Of Wooden 
Clogs won the Golden Palm 
Award for Best Motion 
Picture at last year's Cannes 
Film Festival. The film 's quiet 
nature and simple beauty are 
more than 'sufficient to warm 
the hearts and minds of its 
viewers . 

The Tree O( Wooden Clogs 
is set in the village of 
Lombardy in Northern Italy . 
The time is 1898, jl perioo in 
which feudal society was still in 
firm control. It is within this 
environment that the film 
begins with its story of the lives

of several bharecropper 
families rel>iding together in a 
large tenant farmhouse. The 
examination of the values and 
rituals in their everyday 
experiences is done in short 
vignettes of humanism, which 
intertwine themselves into a 
coherent and cohesive unit. In 
short, The Tree Of Wooden 
Clogs has a wandering and 
unhurried quality that il> as 
natural and basic as the slice of 
peasant culture it 'attempts and 
succeeds in recording onto the 
screen. 

'Erma no Olmi 's direction of 
·the film is magnificent. His 
cast, consisting of villagers 
from the Bergamo country-

side, is both likeable ant( 
credible. The roles range in 
human prototypes from the 
farmhouse's miser, to the pair 
of young lovers, to the 
quarreling father and son, to 
the perserverent widow. The 
audience appeal of the anlies 
of the youngest characters in 
the film show how internation-
al is the limelight-stealing 
abilities of children. Olmi's 
cinematograpAy is unpreten-
tious in composition, yet 
l>pectacular in terms of color. 
His use of non-ador. and 
uncluttered imagery. 
make The Tree Of Wooden 
Clogs a credit 10 its genre of 
neo-realil>tic films.

THE ANIMAL BOWL 
Marlon MIXft and Mark Lochtefeld are 

not unlike many student. at UCSD. Both 
are unauuming, ambitious senior. who 
eKpeCt 10 pick up their aheejMkins aoon. 
Moore in computer lCience and Lochtefelcl 
in economics. Although MIXft is amaler 
that moll (on the Ihort aide of 5·8) and 
Lac:hteIeId iI a little .lurdier, you wouldn'l 
J*1icuIarIy notice either of ttw,m if they 
.... into the room. 

Thia Sunday, however, if you happen to 
be watchintr the fourth annual rendition of 
the Animaf Bowl on Muir ~leld, you will 
have a louIIh lime misaina either of them. 
They'D be the two beat football p/ayefll 00 
the lieId. Both are expected to be there. 

Moore iI the tailback for undefeated 
Chocolate City (6-0), the lleason·long No. 
1 raled team in Men's AAA football. 
Lochtefeld play. blocking back for Unbeat 
Meat, also undefeated, and winner of the 
lut two Animal Bowl •. 

Animal Bowl Sunday is looming larger 
f!¥~ dar as a rematch between last 
sealOl1', (and this sealOn',) two beIIt 1M 
foolbaH team •• If you remember Animal 
Bowl III, Unbeal Meat (then known u 
Raw Meat) defeated CC 27 ·26 in an 
overtime tltriler. 

Moore and Lochtefeld both played in 
that game and both are looking forward to 
meeting again. 

This is not to say that they'll get there. 
both Chocolate City and Unbeat ,Meat 
have testing semi.final games this 
Saturday. CC against last year's AA 
champs, the Rocky Mountain Oysters and 
Unbeat Meat against, perhapH the best 
offensive team in AAA, Return of The. 

Let us not kid one another. Both the 
Oysters and Retum plan on showing up 
Saturday and both will have plenty to say 
-about who's going where on Sunday. But, 
il the form sheet holds up, look for CC and 
Meat to tangle in the final. Moore and 
Lochtefeld will probably be the difference. 

Marlon "the Magician" as he is 

IiOIIIetime. known may not be Charlie 
White, but at UCSD no one comes closer. _ 
Hill unique running Ityle consistently 
leaves would·be flag puller. groping with a 
handful of air. Moore has been in a couple 
of championship game. before. As a 
student at UC-River.ide, hia team the 
Machine completely dominated that 
school'. 1M program for two yearH.Last 
year his CC team came all close a. you can 
come. Thi. year the guys from the Fudge 
Factory lay they want the whole pie . 

Moore will get plenty of help from QB 
Dexter McMichael, WR Chris 
Wa.hington, and Tight End William 
McDaniel. Greg EvaN> will head up a 
defensive backfield that has been tough to 
penetrate. 

If anyone can do it, Lochtefeld might be 
the man. A sure·handed receiver and 
elusive runner as sell, Loch "The Block" is 
a rarity in 1M football . He loves to stick. 
''Give me a good hit anytime," says Mark, 
"those other guys can catch all the 70-yard 
touchdown bombs they wanl." 

As a 100tbaD player, Lochtefeld has an 
even rarer accomplishment. He has never 
played in a losing football game at UCSD. 
Four years ago, his team opened the 

season in the AA division and losl. 
Lochtefeld missed that game but has 
played in everyone since_ Raw Meat won 
AA that year, swept to two consecutive 
AAA titles in '77 and '78 and is sill 
undefeated this time around . For 
Lochtefeld that's 30 straight games 
without the agony of defeat. We all should 
be so fortunate. 

Meat, however, is no one man gang. QB 
Bob Mulick is easily the mo~t improved 
player in the school and possesses perhaps 
the strongest throwing arm, while Matt 
Wright and Dave Wiesehan anchor the top 
defense in the division. 

All in all, the trappings seem to be (" 
place lor another classic. Now, all CC and 
Meat have to do is g~t there. 

r----- SOUL BOWL -~----, 
Thi. i. the new baby on the block. In an 

effort to give some other coed teams a 
chance to garner a bowl invitation, the 
alway. innovative 1M office came up with 
a new divi.ion. Coed A football now 
features all of those teams that got tired of 
finishing 3rd and 4th behind the Shielde,. 
and Better Hand •. 

And frankly, this division has been a 
whole lot more exciting in 1979. Believe 
me, Coed A play. lOme ' wide open 
football. 

Hot Fudge (6·l) and the Ebony Stars 
(7 ·0) are the two favorites to put some.ouI 

in this bowl. But, the Athletic Supporters 
(6·1) and Ooma Gooma (6·1) will be 
doing their best to make this a salt and 
pepper affair. Anyway, you shake it, it', 
going to be exciting. 

Hot fudge has the touchdown twins 
Damita Davis and Felicia Stewart, while 
the Stars counter with outstanding 
defensive back. Glenda Allen and T eri 
Arther. The Supporters run the most 
sophisticated paIS patterns seen thi» side of 
BYU, and Ooma gooma brings in a Heet 
set of receiven that have movel tike RT 00·

BANANA 
BOWL 

AA football usually produces the most 
competitive play·off of them all. This year 
started out no differently, but all of a 

~udden there is an imposter in the group. 
When the tournament started two weeks 
ago, some 24 highly successful teams all 
thought they had a chance to take it all. 
Now there are just three ... and oh yes, 
there's still that impoSier. The New York 
Hunt Club finally blew their cool and their 
cover. After casually drubbing most of 
their Trojan League opponenb, the New 
Yorkers finally let the lid off their high 
energy attack al)d wacked the bejabbers 
out of the Nobodies 46·6 and Suck Muck 
Dicks 41·6_ These guys can play some 
ball. If you're a betting man, you might as 
well forget it. You can mail thiH one in_ 
NYHC has too many thoroughbreds in the 
backstretch. Kenny Schell, George 
Mc EIdowney, and Eugene Delenia all can 
motor_ I mean these guys can leave you in 
·a hurry. And once the track meet starts 
they usually do. 

Methadone (7·0), TDH Deep Threats 
(7·1), and this year's cinderel,la club The 
TKie (6-0) all will give chase but none 
appear to have enough speed. Well , take 
that back! The guys from Methadone,have 
been known to pop a few before the big 
one, but this year they might 00 in over 
their heads . The sky-high kids do have 
some outstanding talent though with DB 
Wes Gardiner, linebacker Rick Ferlito, and 
QB Mark Satterlee leading the way_ 
Methadone will have to do it thi~ year 
though. They've run out of team names 
and drug counselors that have the time to 
listen to them. 

The Tide features QB Dave Janllen and 
wide receivers Gary O'Hara and Bill 
Mountain, but the real strength of this club 
rests in their rock·ribbed defense that in the 
words of many Tide players ''has been 
carrying the 0 all sea~n long." 

The tall, dark, and handsome lads from 
Deep Threat may be the sleeping giant in 
the field _ TDH lost only once in the first 
game of the season 19.zip to yep, you 
guessed it, the New York Hunt Club. 

CADAVER 
BOWL I 

There are a couple of legitimate 
c~tenders for this year's Cadaver Bowl 
invitation. The Scalpels (7·0) and D.O.A. 
(6.1) qualify on their team namel alone. 
The winner of this one wiD definitely add 
the ghastly flavor that thili bowl game hal 
lacked in the'past (yuck!). They also have 
two very fine football team. that jusl might 
end up weari", the crown. 

Standing at the other end of the bracket 
are two prelenden looking to spoil the 

~rty. The Cunning Linguists (5.1) and 
End. and Outs (5·2) are both playing their 
belt baH of the sealiOn at just the right time . 
In each of their Ia.t play·off game», the 
linguists and E & 0 have shown how to 
put points on die lCoreboard. The 
L.ingui,ts racked up 20·0, 42·6 winl while

12 The Daily Guardian Thurliday, Nov. 29, 1979 

Dylan is Using 
His · Belligerance 
In the" Lord's Work 

COIl/iIlUl'eI from (lnl!l' S 
absence 01 a ny memora ble solo work.. 
While it's true tha t Dyla n's touring 
ba nds in the last few years have been 
instrumenta lly overburdened, his new 
gro up is too conservative a nd 
ped strian in its playing. 

The songs and th ir interpreta tion 
T uesday night may have been 
lackluster, but what really got under 
my skin were llevera l of Dyla n's 
between·song commentl> . The title 
track of Slow Tra in Coming contains 
ste reotyped depic tions of oil -rich 
Arabian ~hei ks with rings in their 
noses , llimplil> tic carica tures tha t made 
me wince the firstiime I heard the song. 
Dyla n made his a nti-Isla mic prejudices 
even more explici t in concert when he 
took a mom ent out to jab a t " the 
Moslems" in Iran, vowing tha t the 
Lord would soon inflic t H is vengeance 
upon them. A strain of hostility runs 
through all of Dylan's works,- but 
ne ver before has he had God Himself 
to support him in his pet peeves. 

publicized a nd, according to every 
published concert review I've seen, he 
hasn't performed a single pre-Slow 
T rain Coming tune during hil> enti re 
tour. In a way, I admire his courage -
fe w performers would disown their past 
as completely as he has . 

It 's safe to assume , then, tha t the 
Born-Again Dylan will be writing 
l>ongs of belligerent Christianity for 
some time. T he one hopeful glimmer 
during his show was tha t his newest , as-
of-yet unrecorded songs wer slightly 
better (at leas t musically) than his low 
Train Coming works. "I've Been 
Saved," in fact, wasn' t half-bad as a 
gospel rocker - it would've been 
be tter, though, wi th some secular 
m aterial to ba lance it. 

Three engine and two truck 
companies from the San Diego Fire 
Department rushed to the Muir campus 
late yesterday morning after receivinll 

an apparently -unfounded call about 
lIrtloke odors on the second floor of the 
Applied Physics and Math building. 

While a fe w in the a udience shouted 
insults during Dylan' s preacherly 
remarks , most of the crowd wall 
supportive, often enthusias tic. I don't 
think any of those who a ttended had 
much cause to complain , actually. 
Dylan's conversion has been widely 

A slightly better than average song 
a midst a morass of mediocre num bers 
is not much to hope for from someone 
who was once America 's premier 
songwriter. If Bob Dylan's spi ri tual 
rebi rth hal> brought him personal 
ha ppiness, I wish him well . It's 
unfortuna te, though , tha t it couldn 't 
ha ve led to a n artistic renaissance for 
him as well . Dylan's heart may ha ve 
received Jesus, but he 's giving out to 
h i& public some thing less than 
inspirationa l.

Principles More Important 
Than Machismo For US 
Continued from (laRt! 2 
guy!>" to be proud of our nation? I find that inc redible. 

Pa rt of this nation's high status in the world is its principle l> of 
generosity and tolerance. We allow dilosension and provocation 
on our college campuses . We a llow frank discussions of 
controversial issues in our schools. W e are well known in the 
world for seeing both sides of an issue; that ilo what the Bill of 
Rights guarantees. Those principles ma ke America what it is , not 
gunboat diplomacy or our burning hatred of . Iranians. 

We are supposed to be an educated nation. Evidence of that 
education should certainly be found on our college campuses. 
Instead , this campus is the site of lynch-mob vengeance, bigotry 
and ignorance. Maybe we don't agree with everything the 
Iranianl> say. But we should at least listen and think about what is 
said . We are Americans and proud of it; now perhaps it i& time we 
stopped acting like spoiled little children and began acting like 
Americans should. 

American Lit in China 
Continued from paRe I 
be mentioned here at an institution of higher learning," Bi , who 
never attended college, added . 

The gap in Chines~ knowledge of American literature caused 
by the cessation of diplomatic and politiclln relations in the '50s 
is a difficult subject for Chinese printing houses, Bi also noted. 

"So we have decided to publish the contemporary works and 
fill the gap al> we go along," he said.
