C hancellor Marye Anne Fox will end her eight-year  tenure  as  UCSD Chancellor in June 2012.   After stepping down, Fox plans to return 
teaching and researching as a professor of chemis-
try at UCSD. 

Foxs chancellorship is 
marked by her expansive 
efforts to improve the 
infrastructure of the 
university, as well as her 
success at enhancing the 
funding and prestige of 
UCSDs academics and 
research. 

At the same time, 
she will be associated 
with the University of 
Californias recent and 
ongoing budget crisis and 
the corresponding hikes in undergraduate tuition 
costs, as well as the Compton Cookout, a racially 
insensitive party thrown by UCSD students that set 
off a wave of student protests on campus in 2010.

Fox has focused on improving the foundation 
and facilities of UCSD during her tenure, investing 
$3.5 billion in capital projects over eight years. 
These projects include the construction of the 
Student Services Center and the renovation and 
expansion of Price Center. 

Foxs capital projects also included expanding 
student housing at UCSD to cope with a burgeoning 
student population that has grown from 25,000 to 

Chancellor Marye Anne Foxs eight-
year tenure will come to an end in 
2012. Fox plans to return to teach-
ing and spend more time with her 
family.

T he ChØ CafØ, a UCSD vegan co-op and DIY, all-ages venue founded in 1980 as a safe haven for those interested in 
radical politics, faces closure. It will be the 
end if the ChØ fails to 
raise $12,000 to renew its 
insurance plan by March 
2012.

Over the years, it has 
been [financially] hard 
for them, guitarist and 
co-founder of a ChØ 
CafØ Benefit blog Jesse 
Kranzler said. There 
have been a lot of freak-outs like this where 
they need money or they will close down.

A break-in last year, in which a $5,000 
PA system was stolen from the co-op, also 

exacerbated

This theft 
d e p l e t e d 
the ChØs 
r e s e r v e 
funds and 
made it 
d i f f i c u l t 
for them to make more recent insurance 
payments. The necessary payments have 
increased over time, and the university 
requires this insurance policy to show their 
condition of operation.

Now the insurance payment has risen to 
$12,000, and since the ChØ lost its 501(c)(3) 
federal non-profit status last November, the 
payment will rely on private donations.

From a legal standpoint, [losing 
their non-profit status means that] 

they wont get as much official help, but 
I think the artistic community will come 
together for them, Kranzler said.

In light of the issues that have arisen, ChØ 
regulars have started the ChØ CafØ Benefit 
blog on Tumblr to raise the money needed to 
save the ChØ. 

[The blog] is more about raising 
community and awareness, Kranzler said.

However, the blogs fundraising efforts have

CA DR.E.A.M. Act Nears Success
By Nicole Chan
Associate News Editor

California legislation that would 
allow illegal immigrants to receive 
public financial aid is nearing approval. 
If Assembly Bill 131 takes effect, the 
California public university system 
would be open to more students and 
could support system-wide diversity 
efforts. � �

Director for Civil and Human 
Rights for the Student Sustainability 
Collective and Student Affirmative 
Action Committee (SAAC) A.S. 
representative Victor Flores-Osorio 
has been actively involved in lobbying 
for the Development, Relief and 
Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) 
Act since his freshman year.

SAAC has been working on it for at 

least three years, Flores-Osorio said. 
[Passage of the DREAM Act] will be 
a win for the progressive community 
on campus.

The DREAM Act  originally 
proposed into senate Aug. 1, 2001 
by Sen. Orin Hatch, R-Ut, and Sen. 
Richard Durbin, D-Il,  is a two-
part legislation that makes illegal 
immigrants eligible to receive financial 
aid. The proposed legislation  
designed for illegal immigrants who 
arrived in the country as minors  
stipulates that candidates be of good 
moral character, have lived in the 
country for five years continuously 
prior to the bills enactment, graduate 
from an American high school and 
continue onto at least two years of 

San Diegos popular concert venue and 
beloved co-op faces closure if its 
organizers fails to raise $12,000 by 
March 2012.

also had a degree of success.

As of now, we have raised nearly 
$1,000, which is good, but if we are 
going to make $12,000 by the spring, 
we need to continue to grow the 
fundraising projects, musician and 
ChØ CafØ Benefit blog co-founder 
George Pritzker said.

During the 1980s, the ChØ was a 
local hot spot for punk and reggae 
shows and went on to be a key 
venue for hardcore, post-punk and 
independent artists. 

Today, while still an on-and-off 
vegan cafe, the co-op is primarily 
a venue for touring and local 
musicians of all styles, including 
hosting dances for UCSDs DJs and 
Vinylphiles Club.

Its all vegan and its drug and 
alcohol free, Pritzker said. Its a 
haven for leftist thoughts and grass-

roots activism and its important, 
especially in San Diego where it 
tends to be a more conservative 
county. We need these places like the 
ChØ to balance that out and create a 
haven for more radical thought.

The blog begins with an 
introduction to the ChØs history as a 
space for counter-culture discussion, 
vegan food and DIY music. 

Then, it becomes a series of 
bands testimonials about the ChØ 
and its value to the San Diego music 
community.

The ChØ CafØ is still my favorite 
music venue to this day, San 
Diego musician Chad Stroup wrote 
in the blog. It is unfathomably 
important that the show-going kids 
have somewhere they can turn the 
negative weights of the world into 
positive energy. That alone is reason 
enough for the ChØ to survive.

Those involved with the blog have 
had varying fundraising ideas. Some 
bands are posting songs available 
to download for a donation, while 
others are planning benefit shows.

Given its all-ages, non-alcoholic 
and open-minded policies, the 
musical community of San Diego 
feels that the loss of the ChØ would 
be substantial.

Over the course of the decades, 
a lot of venues have started to 
disappear and the all-ages scene 
has dwindled and has since become 
dominated by bars and the 21 and 
older scene, Pritzker said. The fact 
that its not a bar and not a place 
where people can buy alcoholic 
drinks makes it that much more 
about the music.

UCSD AVP Forsees No Negative Effects from D.R.E.A.M. Act
higher education.

[The DREAM Act] gives [an] 
opportunity for people in between 
borderlines of affording college to 
attend, Flores-Osorio said. Its a 
good step; it provides financial aid to 
students who never had financial aid 
at one point or another.

The California DREAM Act differs 
from the national DREAM Act, 
which was reintroduced into senate 
in May, in that it cannot provide a 
pathway to citizenship.

The first measure of the DREAM 
Act, which passed in July 2011, 
extends access to illegal immigrant 
students to receive privately funded 
scholarships for state schools. The 
second part of the DREAM Act would 
enable illegal immigrant students 
to receive public scholarships, 
such as Cal Grants. According to 
a story published Aug. 31 in the 
New York Times entitled Legislature 
in California set to pass a Dream 
Act, Gov. Jerry Brown has not 
publicly stated that he would sign the 
second measure, however his staff is 
reportedly working with California 
legislators to minimize costs. 

The DREAM Act will not 
significantly affect the UC student 
body, UC officials told the Los 
Angeles Times Sept. 24 in Dream Act 
legislation could complicate student 
aid picture.

Its not going to have significant 
impact at all, and it wont create a 
competitive disadvantage to students 
of this country, UCLA Director of 
Financial Aid Ronald Johnson told 
the Los Angeles Times.

Both the $1.3 billion Cal Grant 

entitlement program  unlimited 
grants that are given to students 
meeting both academic and low-
income requirements  and the 
$127 million funded Cal Grant 
competitive awards will not interfere 
with U.S. residents applying for the 
aid. According to the Los Angeles 
Times, institutional grants, which 
are funded through student fees, are 
another source of financial aid for 
low-income students. 

While the DREAM Act could 
be beneficial to many, immediate 
visible changes at the UC level would 
remain to be seen, according to 
Flores-Osorio. Attributing increasing 
UC tuition as a key component to 
influencing minority enrollment, 
Flores-Osorio anticipates positive 
changes will more likely be seen at 
community colleges and California 
State Universities. Flores-Osorio 
estimates the UCs will not experience 
increased minority enrollment until 
later generations.

Even if the DREAM Act passes, 
undocumented students will still 
face difficulties to get scholarships, 
Flores-Osorio said.

Scholarships are limited to 
students who dont have a social 
security number, Flores-Osorio said. �

Flores-Osorio says there is a 
possibility of a small backlash from 
conservative students. An Increase 
Diversity Bake Sale organized by the 
UC Berkeley College Republicans 
is indicative of potential larger 
reactions, should Gov. Brown 
approve the second measure, Flores-
Osorio said. 

The UC Berkeley racist bake sale 
is making fun of affirmative action, 

Flores-Osorio said. There might be 
a backlash at UCSD, but it would 
probably only be a small group of 
people.

According to Flores-Osorio, the 
university does not take regular 
statistics of its undocumented 
students, so the number of students 
the DREAM Act would potentially 
help is unknown. Despite this fact, 
Flores-Osorio believes it will have a 
positive impact on future students 
hoping to attend university. 

Muir College junior Michelle Lara, 
who works as Campus Diversity 
Engagement Co-Coordinator at 
SPACES, said she personally knows 
of Assembly Bill 540 students who 
could greatly benefit from the 
DREAM Act.

I know a lot of them have 
had to leave because of [lack of] 
affordability, Lara said. Theyre 
getting shoved out of the system. If 
the DREAM Act passes, theyd be 
able to stay and graduate.

Associate Vice President of 
External Affairs Samer Naji does not 
see UCSD experiencing any negative 
effects if the bill passes.

It would literally just help students 
who are not eligible for [government 
issued] financial aid now, Naji said. 
Along with every UC campus theres 
going to be AB540 students  thats 
without a doubt  almost every 
AB540 student will be able to access 
financial aid.

A spokesperson from the UC 
Office of the President could not be 
reached for comment.

30,000 since 2004. 
This included the construction 

of the Village apartments for 
transfer students, as well as various 
improvements toward on-campus 
apartment housing and graduate 
student housing. By the time of 
their completion, Foxs construction 
projects will have expanded the 
campus size by 40 percent.

UCSDs reputation in both 
academics and research was 
enhanced during Foxs tenure. 

The university conducted 
more than $1 billion in sponsored 
research from undergraduates, 
graduate students and faculty in 
2010 alone. 

In 2011, the university retained 
its U.S. News & World ranking as 
the eighth best public university 
in the nation and the 37th best 
university in the nation overall, 
despite budget cuts. 

[Fox] has raised the academic 
reputation of the campus, and it is 
going to be preserved regardless 
of the budget cuts, 2009-10 A.S. 
Council President Utsav Gupta said. 
Even with the cuts, she worked 
to continue [ensuring] that UCSD 
rises.

Foxs tenure as chancellor has 
also been affected by challenges 
ranging from tuition hikes to racial 
controversy. 

Facing a budget crisis, the UC 
Board of Regents announced a 32 
percent increase in tuition fees for 
undergraduate students in 2009, 
sparking a wave of protests that led 
to the arrests of nearly 100 students 
throughout the UC system. 

The UC Board of Regents 
has increased tuition to aid the 
UC systems financial woes since 
2009  raising fall tuition for UC 
undergraduates by 9.6 percent this 
July.

Foxs administration was also 
marked by the Compton Cookout, 
which set off a string of racist 
acts in Winter 2010, including the 

placement of a noose in Geisel 
Library. These events triggered 
student protests in favor of 
racial diversity and the increased 
enrollment of underrepresented 
minorities.

I can tell you that on a personal 
and human level that she felt it 
deeply  that we were failing some 
part of the community, Associate 
Vice Chancellor of Public Programs 
Mary Walshok said in the July 5 
article Foxs UCSD Tenure had 
Trials, Triumphs in the San Diego 
Union-Tribune. I think it grieved 
her, to be frank.

Backlash over the Compton 
Cookout has led to a range 
of initiatives by Fox and the 
administration to remedy problems 
brought up by protesters. 

These initiatives include 
the establishment of a diversity 
requirement for all incoming 
graduates, as well as the 
establishment of a new Vice 
Chancellor for Equity, Diversity 
and Inclusion.

Shes an extremely brave 
person; when there were student 
protests, she met with the 
protesters,  Gupta said. I think 
she really worked towards making 
sure those students were heard.

Fox noted in an official 
statement to UCSD that an 
important factor in her decision 
was her desire to spend more time 
with her family. 

 She said she looks forward to 
returning to work as a professor of 
chemistry at UCSD after she leaves 
the position.

The University of California 
will begin an international search 
for appointment of the next 
chancellor this fall.

Fox and Senior Vice Chancellor 
of Academic Affairs Suresh 
Subramani were not available for 
comment.

In the wake of the Republican presidential debate, Republican presidential -candidate Michele Bachmann denounced the HPV (human papilloma 
virus) vaccine for causing “mental retardation” on Fox News, the Today 
Show and various radio stations. This claim was meant to trip up the leading 
Republican candidate, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who signed an executive order 
mandating the vaccine amongst twelve-year-old girls. The statement may be 
drawing welcome media attention to Bachmann, but at an extreme cost. This 
cheap political gambit could potentially turn young girls and their parents 

away from the vaccine.
Bachmann’s claim holds no weight. Studies conducted by 

the Centers for Disease Control and the Institute of Medicine 
show that 35 million doses of the HPV vaccine “Gardasil” have 
been administered with no reported cases of mental retarda-
tion. In response to Bachmann’s accusation, the American 
Academy of Pediatrics released a statement correcting 
Bachmann’s misinformation. Still, even assurances from cred-
ible sources are not powerful enough to reverse the speculation 
that was activated in the American public.

In 2010, a false autism vaccine link was thought to have 
caused the biggest whooping cough epidemic of the past 60 
years. Although studies show that the whooping cough vac-
cine in no way leads to autism, a scare was enough to cause 
ten infant deaths that could have been avoided with proper 
vaccination according to the California Department of Public

Parents will likely be more cautious when deciding whether to let their 
children get the HPV vaccine, despite the fact that nearly 6 million people 
in the U.S. become infected with HPV and 4,000 women die from cervical 
cancer annually, according to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention. 
Once a statement this powerful is released into the media, regardless of the 
source, people will take notice.

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 26,  2011 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

QUICK TAKES

Welcome Week means free food and drinks and cheaper-than-free flyers, 
but mostly it’s supposed to be a time 
to explore. To find out whatever the 
hell RIMAC is, wherever the hell 
the Village is — and which club, for 
heaven’s sake, throws the most rag-
ing pizza parties of all.

As a senior, I’ve answered most 
of these important questions for 
myself by now. But I’ve never 
switched majors, and so other than 
the 200-seat soft science lectures I 
bushwhacked through in the name 
of general education, one thing I 
haven’t done is take a class outside 
the lit or history departments. 

It’s unfair to generalize, and so I 
usually try not to, but after invest-
ing three years and an ungodly 
amount of tuition in my college 
education, I feel confident in declar-
ing lit majors a rare breed at UCSD. 
We’re always late, we wear too much 
plaid, we share too many irrelevant 
opinions in class — and, guiltily, 
most of us have still never met a 
Moleskine we didn’t like. (It’s not an 
emo diary, OK?)

There are exceptions: people 
who are preternaturally prompt (I 
was born weeks late, if that means 
anything), and others who long ago 
cashed in their last plaid shirt at 
Buffalo Exchange. We come in all 
shapes and sizes and ages and back-
grounds, but for whatever reason, 
the tortured artist/beatnik thing 
seems kind of hard to work past. 

So on Thursday night, in climb-
ing the steps to Warren Lecture 
Hall for not the first time, I don’t 
really know what I was expecting. 
I’d never been to a communications 
class before. Would there just be 
lots of, you know, talking? Would I 
need a notebook? Where, in God’s 
name, was my emo diary?  

I sauntered in 10 minutes early, 
which was when the difference 
immediately struck me: The room 
was already at least half full. People 
carried notebooks and Greek sweat-
shirts and bubble gum and pens. 
Nobody was wearing any plaid. 

As class began, things only got 
weirder. Everyone smiled in intro-
ducing themselves. They noted 
their year, major and intention to 
pursue law school, public relations 
or business. No one wasted breath 
on any awkward, self-indulgent 
detail of their summer (e.g. “I just 
really felt like going to Prague,” or 
“I already had a lot of experience at 
magazines.”) Almost everyone said 
they hoped to improve their writing 
— which, curiously, I don’t recall 
ever hearing a classmate say in three 
years of Lit/Writing courses. We 
must know better.

While the usual orders of busi-
ness took up the rest of the hour, I 
began to recognize something that 
should’ve been obvious: I’ve gotten 
too comfortable. In being a grouchy, 
caffeine-addicted Lit. major that’s 
as guilty of parsing details as the 
next one (even if I don’t know much 
about the magazine business or 
Prague). In recognizing nameless 

This is What a 
UCSD Student 
Doesn’t Look Like

Recently, Michele Bachmann utilized some old-fashioned fear mongering in order to slam Republican presidential frontrunner and Texas Gov. 
Rick Perry. Bachmann based her entire condemnation of the HPV vaccine 
— and Perry’s executive order mandating it’s use — by sharing an anecdote 
from a weeping mother who claimed the vaccine caused her daughter’s 
mental retardation.  While Bachmann is being denounced left and right by 
medical professionals in the Centers for Disease Control and the Institute of 
Medicine, she has also successfully carved her place as a media hot topic with 
the all-too-common political use of fear.

As with any good political ploy, Bachmann’s 
allegations contain some facet of truth. Perry did 
indeed sign the executive order for young girls to 
get the HPV vaccine without bringing it to a vote. 
Perry’s deep political ties with Merck, the corpora-
tion that makes the vaccine and the employer of 
Perry’s former chief of staff, brings attention to 
Perry’s questionable motives in supporting the 
executive order. 

However, Bachmann’s allegations about the 
dangers of the vaccine have no basis in medical 
fact. Medical associations such as the American 
Academy of Pediatrics have re-reviewed stud-
ies and released statements denying the dangers 
of the vaccine in response to Bachmann’s state-
ment.  Correct or not, Bachmann’s comments have 
thrust her into the political spotlight. This controversy alone has plastered 
Bachmann all over the major networks including CNN, NBC, CBS, MSNBC 
and any other network with initials. 

Of course, this is no “Daisy ad” and probably won’t be a major factor in 
her run for president, but it might just be enough to get her to increase her 
exposure — just what the doctor ordered.

The iconic Ché Café, located on the southern edge of campus in the eucalyptus groves, is currently in danger of shutting down due to a $12,000 
budgetary shortfall. The students and volunteers running 
the cafe — a well-known sanctuary for radical political 
beliefs — are beginning to confront the harsh reality of 
tough economic times. Coming up with creative solu-
tions to solve budgetary problems is essential to running 
a business, and this year, the leaders of the Ché will have 
to prove that they have what it takes to keep the venue 
open.

Established in 1980 as a nonprofit student and 

volunteer-run co-operative, the Ché remains a histori-
cally unique spot on campus today. The café, run by a 
“non-hierarchical worker’s collective,” serves all-vegan 
fare and hosts music and poetry performances at least 
once a week. Several years ago, the cafe experienced 
a brief insurance lapse, and just last year, the Ché lost 
its 501(c)(3) federal nonprofit status, losing several tax 
exemptions. On top of all of that, a $5,000 PA system 
was stolen last year. Now, after serving as a symbol of 
underground music for over two decades, the survival of 

Viva la Revolución
The Ché Café faces financial woes that could floor even the most revolutionary campus institution, but with the 

collective effort of supporters and students, the Che might have a fighting chance.

the ChØ is threatened.
The university requires co-ops 

on campus to provide an insurance 
policy as a condition of operation. 
The cafe currently finds itself in 
danger of not being able to come up 
with the $12,000 due in March for 
the renewal of its insurance policy.

As grim as its financial situation 
seems, the cafes supporters are not 
giving up yet  a strong sign of 
hope for the co-ops 
survival. A series of 
fundraising events 
have been scheduled 
to try to save the 
venue. Musician Jess 
Kranzler, who first 
performed in the 
ChØ when he was in 
high school, said that 
he will be perform-
ing Jan. 6-8 to try to 
raise money for it. 
Kranzler, who now 
attends school in New 
York, has also set up 
a fundraising site at 
checafebenefit.tumblr.com, which 
has already raised nearly $1,000 and 
started a string of blog posts in sup-
port of the co-op. The dedication of 
Kranzler and others to the cafe could 
go a long way to help save the venue 
if the underground music com-
munity continues to respond to the 
rallying call.

In fact, recent backing from 
UCSD administrators shows that 
they remain committed to the sur-
vival of the co-op. Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of Student Life Gary 
Ratcliff oversees the ChØ and other 
co-ops on campus, making sure they 
pay rent and stay on top of their 
insurance policies. 

UCSDs iconic ChØ CafØ faces 
possible shut down, Ratcliff said 
in a Sept. 19 article in the San 
Diego Union-Tribune. I am hop-
ing they can work it all out. I really 

am. There’s a certain spirit to their 
approach.”

With university administrators 
on its side, the collective’s support — 
at least for the next several months 
— seems assured.

Numerous money-starved stu-
dent organizations have already 
learned to cope with budget cuts. 
Last year, the Associated Students of 
UCSD reduced the funding of stu-
dent-run media organizations from 
$45,000 to $38,000, a 24-percent 

decrease. Media orga-
nizations on campus 
such as the California 
Review and the Muir 
Quarterly have been 
forced to find alter-
native ways to raise 
money or reduce 
costs, namely cutting 
printing costs by pub-
lishing online.

Raising $12,000 by 
March 2012 will be no 
easy task for the Ché, 
but running a busi-
ness is never simple. 
Ratcliff explained that 

co-ops help students “get first-hand 
experience in running a nonprofit 
enterprise.” While the cafe’s financial 
crunch undoubtedly looks ugly, its 
leaders have a chance — now more 
than ever before — to put their inno-
vative entrepreneurial ideas to the 
test to try to raise enough money to 
keep the co-op going.

Budget cuts and lack of fund-
ing for student organizations may 
eventually take their victims. But 
if there’s any advice the leaders of 
the Ché need now, it’s that when 
students care, they have a chance to 
save the organizations and institu-
tions that truly matter to them. And 
if any organization is able to rise up 
and inspire a revolution of student 
expression, it would be the Ché.

Dear Editor,
Over the past few years, the debate 

over public higher education has 
changed. The questions we ask started 
with “How do we cut the budget with-
out hurting students?” but have largely 
changed to “What can we afford to 
lose?” Your recent article “Summer in 
Review” is a perfect example of how 
the UCSD community values differ-
ent types of education by pointing out 
that the most “unprofitable university 
programs” are those that will face the 
most cuts. These unprofitable pro-
grams are largely thought to include 
the humanities and the social sci-
ences, and it is not uncommon to hear 
UCSD science majors calling these 
programs useless in the modern day. 

Views like those expressed above 
are not only wrong, but they are also 
dangerous. UCSD is known for its 
experimental art programs, and our 
dance and theater departments consis-
tently rank in the top three for gradu-
ate studies. If we were to take massive 
cuts to these programs, the breadth 
of quality education that our school 
offers would suffer. Although it’s easy 
to say that the humanities have no 
effect on plans to become a doctor, 
Nobel Prize Winner, Supreme Court 
Justice or creator of Angry Birds, 
this is short sighted. Doctors must 
be able to read and clearly articulate 
the issue at hand, which is not all that 
different from what we learn in those 
introductory communications and 
theater classes. I had the pleasure of 
hearing Roger Tsien, Nobel Laureate 
in Chemistry, speak a few years ago 
and I still remember him speaking 
about how you must find something 
that is stimulating to one of your 
senses — something artists are always 
doing and perfecting. It is no surprise 

then that fluorescent immunohis-
tochemistry is shown frequently on 
the cover of scientific journals and 
in competitions with themes such as 
“Science as Art.” And who would not 
be afraid of a Supreme Court Justice 
who had only a slight understanding 
of history and law and no appreciation 
whatsoever for the nuances of other 
cultures and languages? That in itself 
shows us the importance of Thurgood 
Marshall’s and ERC’s general educa-
tion requirements. As for Angry 
Birds…How many of us play because 
of how beautiful the code looks? 
Angry Birds is lucrative because the 
sounds of squealing piggies and fall-
ing buildings make us feel like we are 
in control. Could you imagine play-
ing the game on a phone with green 
backlight and black lettering? The 
lesson in these examples is that truly 
profitable human endeavors cannot 
be separated into just humanities vs. 
science. Looking at history, we value 
Einstein as greatly as we do Mozart 
– and Mozart spent much of his time 
mooching off royalty and died in debt. 
With the current salaries of humani-
ties majors, how disastrous will it be if 
we continue to raise fees by 16 percent 
until 2016? While I have no answers 
when speaking about the budget cri-
sis, we should be aware not only of 
how profitable a program is but how 
valuable it is.

faces from just a couple pockets of 
campus and making no effort to 
meet the others. In getting the same 
damn sandwich from the Sunshine 
Market twice a week, and lamenting 
the soggy sourdough just as often. 

I’ve always been quick to criti-
cize those who squeeze their fresh-
man roommate’s hand and never 
let go — people who settle during 
Welcome Week and never come to 
know anything more than exactly 
one beer-pong table and toilet. But 
I’ve also realized that in limiting 
myself to one set of classes, to one 
corner of campus, I’ve done no bet-
ter myself. 

Maybe that Natural Disasters 
class wasn’t ever meant to parlay 
itself into a career in science (so 
please: Don’t call me Dr. Cox, or the 
Cox doc or whatever). 

Maybe my failure to grasp the 
nuances of Intro to Logic is a testa-
ment to my place in the world as 
an illogical, irrational artist type 
(another theory: my liberal arts boy 
glasses are to blame for everything). 
But what if I’d been more open to 
the unknown? 

No matter how many heated 
A.S. Council meetings or dubstep-
blaring fraternity booths we go out 
of our way to witness, each of us 
has a relatively narrow view of what 
a UCSD student looks like. It just 

comes down to the numbers: There 
isn’t any way to sift through 23,000 
anonymous faces and emerge with 
a full, detailed portrait of who or 
what we are. 

The way to start, though, is 
probably by doing the opposite of 
what I have: Meet everyone. Try 
everything. It’s the beginning of the 
year, and if all doesn’t go according 
to plan, no one’s going to remember 
or care by Thanksgiving. 

And so I implore you, dear read-
ers young and old, freshman and 
sixth-year, to consider the unfamil-
iar this year. It’s my last, and while 
I don’t have many classes left, there 
must be at least a dozen beers at the 
pub I haven’t tried.
