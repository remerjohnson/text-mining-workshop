Commissioner Quits 
After Public Upr.,.. 
SANTA BARBARA-
In the wake of an uproar over 
comments that many believed 
were discriminatory against 
gays, Santa Barbara fire and 
Police Commissioner Josiah 
Jenkins resigned two weeks 
ago. On Sept. 23, Jenkins, a 
commission member since 
1991, made several comments 
that angered many gays and 
lesbians during a commission 
hearing on allegedly illegal 
activities at a local club that 
hosted a weekly event aimed 
at homosexuals. "I just don't 
like the idea of promoting all 
of this gay stuff," Jenkins 
said at the meeting. "I know 
they've got their rights and all 
that, but to promote the 
lifestyle I don't think is 
good."

LGBA Will Lobby 
Watson to Alter Policy 
RIGHTS: Vice Chancellor sits on accreditation board 
that does not protect gays from discrirrunation 
By Karen Cheng 
Senior Staff Writer 

The debate over gay and les-
bian civil rights is hitting close to 
home. UCSD's Vice Chancellor 
for Student Affairs Joseph Watson 
serves as the vice chair of an ac-
crediting commission which says 
sexual orientation is not necessar-
ily protected by anti-discrimina-
tion policies. 

The Western Association of 
Schools and Colleges (W ASC), 
the regional college accrediting 
agency, said in its diversi ty policy 
statement that lesbians and gays 
"deserve careful con ideration." 

After five years of working to 
establish its diver ' ity statement, 
the first draft included sexual ori-
e'ntation as a category for protec-
tion from discrimination . 

However, after considerable 
debate among religious school 
members, the third and final draft 
now includes a paragraph that 
states, "There is no religious or 
moral consensus on issues of 
sexual orientation among the in-
stitutions accredited by this Com-
mission and it is certainly not the 
function of the Commission to 
impose its own moral stance with 
respect to the admission of stu-
dents or the employment of staff 
or faculty." 

UCSD's Lesbian, Gay and Bi-
sexual Association (LGBA) got 
wind of the report three weeks 
ago. LGBA member Alex Garner 
said that the policy has potentially 
debilitating effects on the gay com-
munity. 

"For the queer community, ob-
viously it 's a matter of our civil 
rights. It 's a matter of life and 
death, whether or not we hay:! jobs 
or are discriminated against. There 
are so many people who are trying 
to take the rights away from gays 
and lesbians, whether it 's with 
parenting or with jobs, that we 

Vice Chancellor Joseph Watson 
can't allow for anOlher i n~titution 
to try and do that." he ... aid . 

Garner said that hi~ primary 
objective i-; to lobby W;mon for 
upport. 

"Our main goals right now are 
to get as much attention brought to 
this as possible before February. 
We're going to start a letter-wri t-
ing campaign directed to WASC 
and to get Watson on our side. We 
have to say that we don' t support 
this policy, that there needs to be 
tolerance of anti-di sc rimination 
toward gays, lesbians and bisexu-
als," he aid . 

According to Watson, however, 
the issue of sexual orientation in 
anti-discriminatory education poli-
cies,especially in religioLls schools 
and colleges, is a moral one. 

"There' . a tratlition ot the \epa-
ration of church anti ~ta tt: : 1'111 not 
prepared to say that the state should 
impose its view," he said. 

However, Watson contended 
that there has been a long period of 
intense debate over the i..,sue 
among various W ASC board mem-
bers, and that the issue has been 
discllssed extel1~i\' ely :111l011g

Rash of Obs('('ne CalIs Prompts Advice from Police 
By ErIk JohMon 
Staff Writer 

A recent surge in obscene phone 
calls to UCSD students has campus 
police warning students to take steps 
to protect themselves. The UCSp 
Police Department has logged 29 
reports of obscene phone calls for 
the farst half of Fall Quarter alone, 
compared to a total of just 18 dur-
in, Spring Quarter. 

The calls often follow a typical 
pattern. The caller will claim to be 
a police officer calling to conduct 
an investigation, insbUCting the vic-
tim to stay on the line if she should 
receive any obscene phone calls. 
Soon after, the same perpetrator 

. . dls back and proceeds to harass 
the victim. 

"No law enforcement agency 
operates that way - none," said 
Officer Al Jenkins, who said that 
this crime is "100 percent avoid-
able. 

"If you get a call of this kind, 
simply hang up right away," Jenkins 
said. 

The police recommended that 
students also be wary of telephone 
surveys, since obscene phone call-
ers often pose as surveyors. Jenkins 
said that students should ask for the 
caUer's phone number, organiza-
tion, and superior. "If it sounds at 
all suspect. just hang up immedi-

COLOR USED 

ately," he said . 
Although threats over the phone 

are common, personal encounters 
between victims and callers are 
extremely rare . According to 
Jenkins, most callers are simply 
random people who have gotten a 
copy of the tudent directory. Re-
peat calls are also uncommon, p<>-
lice records indicate. 

The victims are all on-campus 
residents and are almost all female. 
'This is a crime, like many others, 
that is typically committed against 
women, and they can protect them-
selves," Jenkins said. 

Jenkins recommended that stu-
dents list only their first initial in-

stead of their tirst name, making it 
impossible for the perpetrator to 
ascenain the genderofthe resident. 

The recent surge in report of 
obscene phone calls is similar to a 
rash of incidents that OCCUlTed last 
January. In those cases. the caller 
impersonated a police officer and 
later called. back to harass his fe-
male victims. Working with the 
San Diego Police Department, 
UCSD police were unable to turn 
up any leads or pos~ible ~u~pects. 

If a student does receive a ca ll,

tims to hang up immediately. write

Chancellors Reject 
UCSA Escrow Proposal

By Philip Michaels

At its meeting in Oakland last

to Alva, the chancellors ruled that 
the escrow proposal did not com-

"I'm very di sappointed. Oneof 
the fundametal questions is why 
should the chancellors make a de-
cision about the policy student gov-

ance. 
The first oplion - the positive 

check-off plan - would be to con-
t i nue to collect mandatory student 
fees for ~tudent government and 
campus organizations that are de-
fined as educational. Students 
would then be able to "check off' 
a box on (heir registration forms if 
they wanted to pay the voluntary

ideological organizations. 

Under the second option. one 
mandatory fee would be charged 
to fund all student government 

.activities except for political lob-
bying. Two voluntary fees - one 
for funding student organizations 
and one for funding off-campus 
lobbying activi ty-would also be 
assessed. 

The chancellors rejected the 
UCSA'~ proposal to keep student 
fees in an escrow account for five 
weeks. giving students the option 
of reclaiming their money before 
it was allocated to political orideo-

money."

Alva added that campuses are 
free to adopt other plans as long as 
the new plan provides a refund of 
fees for the Fall Quarter and is 
approved by UC General Coun-
sel. 

According to Endres. the A.S.

Computer Information System 
Added to Price Center Theatre 

A computer system installed over the summer in 
the lobby of the Price Center Theatre will enable UCSD 
students to find the best value for their money as well 
as information on where various entertainment. dining 
establishments, stores and other businesses are 
located, according to InfoSystems USA. the developer 
of the computer. 

The Business Information Guide (BIG) provides 
coupons redeemable at many area businesses and

COMMENTARIES: REGINALD DENNY VERDICT 

Jl1stice· 
IsSei-Ved 
Both the Rodney King and Reginald Denny verdicts 

. reflect an outdated, inflexible criminal justice system 
By David Snow 
Senior Staff Writer 

In April of 1992, after the verdicts of the first Rodney King 
trinl were announced, angry students here at UCSD responded 
by doing such useful things as breaking a window at the 
bookstore and demanding that Vice Chancellor Joe Watson, 
of all people, write a letter of condemnation to the court 

~yst em . Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, some people vented their 
frustr.ttions in even more senseless ways, but at least they got

the verdicts 
lies In the out-
dated, Inflex-
Ible system we 
have in this 
country for 
punishing 
criminals. ' 

a VCR or two out of it. 
Similarly, the majority of the 

reactions to the recent Reginald 
Denny verdicts are, while of a less 
violent nature, equally angry and con-
fused. Calls flooded radio and TV 
talk shows with essentially the same 
concerns: "How could those guys be 
acquitted of al most every charge when 
the whole nation saw them beat Denny 
to near-death?" 

These sentiments are exactly the 
same as those that surfaced after the 
original 1992 verdicts. "Miscarriage 
of justice" and "biased jury" be-
came fashionable, as did the rally 
cry, "the judicial system has 
failed:' 

All this frustration, though 
well-intentioned, is misdirected. 
The error of the verdicts lies 
not in the jury or the pre-
trial publicity or even in 
the strategy of the pros-
ecution. but in the out-
dated, inflexible system 

we have in this country for punishing criminals. 
Ask the average man on the street what charges 

Stacey Koon was acquitted of, and you're liable to get 
a blank stare. Most people. no matter how well-
informed, are likely to forget the exact terminology of 
the crimes that Monroe Williams and Henry K. Watson 
ended up being charged with, if they ever bothered to 
learn the legal terms at all. What matters to them is that 
Watson, despite assaulting and robbing a man on international 
television, is going home. 

The ~ame can be said for the first Rodney King trial. Few

Justice Does Have Two Faces 
The black community's response to the Denny verdicts is hypocriticaJ at best and reflects a desire for arbitrary justice 

By Marlo Lopez 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Consider this scenario: a group 
of white men drag a black motorist 
from his car, and beat him to a pulp. 
After the men go to trial, they are 
acquitted of the most serious charges 
and only convicted of some lesser 
misdemeanors. 

What do you suppose would hap-
pen after such a trial- Los Angeles 
riots, pan deux? Everyone would be 
running around. screaming about 

raci~m. about injustice, about the 
fact thut people ~hould be held ac-
countable for their own actions. 

Je~~e Jackson, Maxine Water 
and other African·American lead-

ers wquld probably be inciting 
crowds to violence with chants of 
"No justice, no peace," just as they 
did after the Rodney King verdict. 

But this is what really happened. 
During the Los Angeles riots, a group 
of black men dragged a white mo-
torist from his car and beat him to a 
pulp. Two of the men went on trial 
for the beating Reginald Denny, 
were acquifttd of the most serious 
charges and convicted of lesser mis-
demeanor Charges. The black 
leadership's response tothe verdicts 
was irresponsible and completely 
ridiculous. The leaders were pleased 
that '~ustice" was served. that the 
judicial system finally worked for

them and that this verdict will keep 
the peace in the streets of LA. Some 
went even further, suggesting that 
Damion Williams and Henry 
Watson should never have been 
prosecuted to begin with, that these 
men could be excused for their ac-
tions . Considering the rage that they 
felt during the aftermath ofthe Ki ng 
trial, theirfeelings were understand-
able. 

These people laugh in the face of 
responsibility and human decency 
when they want to convince us that 
it is all right to beat somebody, kick 
him repeatedly, smash objects over 
his head and injure him ~o ~everely 
that he requires several days of hos-

pitalization. And why? All because 
someone was mud and wanled to 
vent his frustrations at an unjust 
verdict. 

When one cnn vittually get away 
with action. like those of Williams 
and Watson, it make. a complete 
mockery of our judicial system. 
Those that condone such bUltaric 
behavior spit in the face of basic 
human rights . What did Reginald

VICE CHANCElLOR RESPONDS TO SMITH DEBATE 
Editor: 

For better or worse. the Califor-
nia Supreme Court has ruled in the 
S",i,II vs Regents case that manda-
tory fees cannot be used to force 
students to support or associate with 
religious, political, ideological or 
lobbying organizations and activi-
ties. The university must now com-
ply with this decision. 

In consultation with student gov-
ernments and the University of Cali-
fornia Student Association (UCSA), 
the administration has attempted to 
develop policies and procedures that 
achieve several objectives: I) Full 
compliance with the court decision; 
2) Continued funding for student 
governments and the vast majority 
of student organizations which re-
main eligible for mandatory fee 
funding under the decision; and 3) 
The opportunity for campuses and 
student governments to comply with 
the ruling and university policies in 
ways that best match their specific 
circumstances and priorities. 

Two proposals which achieve 
these objectives have been recom-
mended to UC President lack

Peitason and the Council of Chan-
cellors for adoption. 

The UCSA has proposed the al-
ternative of an escrow account as a 
way to comply with the court deci-
sion. After careful consideration, it 
is the consensus opinion of the Stu-
dent Affairs Offices of the univer-
sity that the escrow account pro-
posal is inconsistent with the prin-
ciple that students should not be 
forced to endure the expense and 
convenience of paying a "volun-
tary" fee - which they do not wish 
to pay - and then requesting a 
refund. Further, it is the opinion of 
General Counsel that the escrow 
account approach would not be in 
compliance with the court decision. 

The court decision permits the 
use of voluntary student fees for 
political. ideological, lobby organi-
zations and activities. The UCSD 
administration is open to any effort 
on the palt of the UCSA or campus 
governments to solicit voluntary fees 
as permitted by the court decisions.

little fact - after all, he had a rough

We'll just overlook that Will-

Imagine the kind of precedent

someone commits murder. they'lI

Pretty convenient for the crimi-

Get one thing straight: if you

VERDICT: The 
public's anger 
toward the verdicts 
Continued from pall. 4 
people care what the four police-
men were officially charged with-
something like excessive force -
but what sparked the anger that set 
off the L.A. riots was the fact that 
the officers were to receive almost 
no punishment at all. It took a sec-
ond trial on different charges to ap-
pease the public's thirst for justice. 
Despite jail time for a couple of the 
hapless cops, some still cried. "the 
system has failed." 

In reality, given the parameters 
of the current judicial procedures, 
the system worked just the way it 
should have. The problem is in cre-
ating specific categories for the 
never-ending variety of bad things 
people do. The closest category that 
the L.A.P.D. officers could fit into 
was assault by force and unneces-
sary beating of a person. 

What this amounted to for the 
prosecution was having to convince 
the jury beyond a reasonable a doubt 
that the police officers, without any 
good reason, beat King for sinister 
fun. 

This, of course, is hard to prove, 
videotape evidence notwithstand-
ing. The charges, with their prede-
tennined prison sentences, did not 
fit the specific crime. The verdicts 
in this case were frustrating because 
the police officer had clearly done 
something wrong, but because their 
crime did not fit the exact param-
eters of the charges, they were let 
off. 

The same was true for the Denny 
case. We all saw the footage of 
Williams and Watson, in the chaos 
of the riot, hurl a brick into Denny's 
head and then dance a victory jig 
while the trucker lay with blood 
streaming out of his skull. The pros-
ecution decided that the charge 
which most fit this crime was at-
tempted murder and "aggravated 
mayhem."

Then it had to prove, based on a 
few witnesses and a videotape, that 
Williams and Watson had speci fi-
cally intended 1'01' Denny to die by 
(he brick. This, again . was hard to 
prove because sUI'ely they would 
have thrown the brick a fe w more 
times if thi s was their specitic in-
tent. Becau e their cri me did not 
meet the specifications of these e-
rious charges, they were convicted 
of far lesser one~. 

But the m:Jjority of the publ ic 
was not angry at the charges given 
but at the fact that the punishments 
did not tit the crime. Williams, for 
instance, was given onl y felony 
mayhem, .md stands to be in prison 
for perhaps two years, Many feel 
that this is a paltry punishment for 
nearly killing a man and di , tiguring 
his head in the process. Many would 
be satisfied with any charge that 
would adequately pun ish these two 
men. 

Such was the ca se with the 
L.A.P.D. ofticers. It didn't matter 
whether (hey were charged with as-
sault or ci vii rights violations, as 
long a they were punished fortheir 
specific and particular crime - jus-
tice was erved. 

Thejury should be afforded 11l0re 
flexibility in sentencing criminals, 
Williams and Warson do not de-
serve life in prison for rheir crimes. 
The situation was very complicated, 
and their moti vations were di fferent 
from the rhe use of many other as-
ault . If the jury had the option of 

handing down a sentence thm in-
cluded a more titting punishment, 
maybe one thar included working 
on some public project and a com-
pulsory counseling, they would have 
been more likely todecideon it. But 
the notion of life in prison for rhe 
two was unappealing. 

The Simi Valley jurors were 
faced with the samedilemmu. These 
policemen did nOl commit a routine 
criminal assault, as many critics have 
claimed. There were complex cir-
cumstances surrounding the beat-
ing. including a high-speed car 
chase, police standard operating pro-
cedure and fear. It is clear that the 
ofticers used excessive force and 
were inexcusably cruel in their treat-
ment of Mr. King, but their crime 
did not quite fit the charge.The Simi 
jurors did the right thing and acquit-
ted them. 

The Simi Valley jurors recog-
nized th'at the officers did not de-
serve to spend years in prison. They 
were not dangerous cri minuls. They 
would not have beaten King had he 
cut in front of them at the donut 
shop. However, the officers are un-
fit to hold any oftice of aUlhority 
that allows them to use force. <Ind 
they deserve to be punished for their 
treatm ent of King. But the ha rd 
prison (ime for which their charges 
called was not right. If the jury had 
(he option of handing them a sen-
tence more tailor-mude to (heir spe-
cific crime, perhaps one including 
hard service in minority communi-
ties, they would have jumped at the 
opportunity. 

The most frustrating aspect of 
these trials is that the public makes 
up its mind ahead of ti lIIe when a 
punishment i in order. and it is 
usually right. But our inflexible and 
inaccurate entencing ~ys tel1l pre-
scribes punishments which are ei-
ther too harsh to be handed down or 
too lenient to atisfy justice. Some 
reform and innovation in the out-
dated hard-time-in-prison sentences 
would make sure the punishment 
fits the crime.

UCSD Minority Enrollment Rises 
STUDENTS: Slight jump 
for this campus adds to 
system-wide increase 
By Jonn. Palmer 
Associate News Editor 

Following a downswing in mi-
nority enrollment during 1990, 
efforts to recruit more Chicano 
and African-American students 
seem to be paying off for both 
UCSD and the University of Cali-
fornia as a whole. 

While the IOta I number of mi-
nority undergraduates stayed about 
the same, (he number of first-year 
minorities increased this year. 
According to the registrar'S of-
tice, the number of new Chicano 
students rose from 190 to 245. The 
number of incoming African-
American students remained un-
changed from 1992. 

In total, African-Americans 
comprise 2.4 percent of the first-
year students at UCSD. Chicanos 
comprise 9.9 percent, up from 7.2 
percent one year ago. 

The news wasn ' t all good for 
UCSD. The number of African-
American and Chicano transfer 
students dropped this year, down 
.8 percent and 1.7 percent, respec-
tively, from last year's count. 

Althoullh the increase was good 
news, Director of Student Out-
reach Victoria Valle said that more 
work needs to be done. 

"I don ' t think that2.7 percent is

is no consensus on the matter -
[ir's a matter] of religiOUS and 
moral issues." Religious colleges 
should not be forced to comply 
with rules that conflict with their 
beliefs, Watson added. 

According to Watson, the 
policy should be in place for pub-
lic institutions like the UC and 
CSU systems, and there should be 
no discrimination on the basis of 
sexual orientation. But for reli-
gious schools and colleges, the 
commission did not take a posi-
tion on religious and moral 
grounds, and as a result, there was 
no consensus. 

"We're not saying that religious 
schools cannot discriminate. Some 
concerns have been expressed that 
it weakens policy; we are just re-
porting the facts with respect to 
moral grounds. It 's up to them ... 
we're not taking a position," he 
said. 

Garner, however, said that it is 
not a question of morality, but of 
civil rights. 

real, real significant. It's beuer, 
but I don't think that we as an 
institution can rest on our laurels. 
We still have to work very, very 
hard," Valle said. 

"We 'd like to see more diver-
sity refkcted in our student body. 
[It should be a student body that] 
reflects more of the world. the 
stare, than we have right now." she 
added. 

Valle said that actually getting 
the minority students who are ac-
cepted 10 UCSD to enroll here is a 
big challenge for Student Out-
reach. ''The most significant chal-
lenge thar we face is ... that Afri-
can-American students who are 
eligible have so many choices," 
Valle said. 

She added that many of 
UCSD's top admits are also ac-
cepted to UCLA, UC Berkley and 
Davis . Many top students who 
are admitted to such prestigious 
schoolsas Harvard and Smith will 
choose to attend a better-known 
university. 

"The higher the student's aca-
demic credentials, the tougher the 
compeiition," said Valle, adding 
that scholarship money used to 
attract students to UCSD is not as 
available as it has been in the 
past. 

As a result, Student Outreach 
started calling "prospects" for the 
first time this year, instead of just 
sending out letters to recruit po-
tential minority students. "We had 

"[WASC'sl impression is that 
it's a moral issue ... who are thtly to 
say what people' s moral beliefs 
should be? But for us, it's obvi-
ously much more than that - it 's 
an issue of civil rights and consti-
tutional rights and discrimination," 
Garner said. 

''That's why people are really 
trying to get the word our and 
getting as much attention brought 
to it as possible before it becomes 
official," he added. 

According to Garner, gay and 
lesbian organizations at other pub-
lic universities like UCLA and UC 
Santa Cruz are presently working 
toward the same goals. 

Watson's suppon in this issue 
is crucial, Garner said. "[t would 
be really great to see our campus 
denounce the policy and Watson, 
being on the board, sayi ng 'we 
don 't support this, we want to see 
a change, .. ' he added. 

"It's easy for them to gloss it 
over and call it a moral issue -
it's safer fol' them - they don't 
have to touch it. It's pretty obvi-
ous to us and pretty obvious to our 
government that it's not a moral 
issue - it's a political and social 
issue," Gamer said.

Overall , the University of Cal i-

enrolling this year. According to 
figures from the Office of the Pres i-

Cali fornia is up J 6 percent to 3,056, 
an increa e of 426 over last year. 
African-American enrollment 
among freshmen and transfers is 
up 4 percent to 1, 153. The UC's 
figures are based on preliminary 
estimates.

from schools around the state will

The final WASC policy with 
the provision that sexual orienta-
tion be included in its anti-dis-
crimination diversity statement 
will be voted upon in February. 

"[The WASC] policy states that 
you have to include gays and les-
bians in [acollege's] non-discrimi-
nation policy - technically, 
[WASCJ can't be accrediting col-
leges, but if that changes, they can 
accredit more colleges that don ' t 
include [the policy statement]. 
They will have to wait until the 
policy becomes institutionalized 
before they can officially accredit," 
Garner said. 

WASC is a regional accredit-
ing body that encompasses schools 
and universities in California, 
Hawaii and Guam. It consists of 
137 schools, including both the 
UC and the CSU systems, and 
many private liberal arts colleges 
and religious institutions. Being 
accredited by WASC makes it 
much easier for a college or uni-
versity to receive loans for stu-
dents or grants for faculty.

SHOPPING: CqUege students looking to save.a buck on dining, clothing and 
entertainment can uncover a bonanza of buys in the greater San Diego area 
By Sarah Pitts 
Guardian Reporter 

OING TO COLLEGE IN LA 
Jolla has its advantages: 
the beach, the weather, 
the baja fish tacos. But 
having a campus lo-
cated near one of the 
more affluent com-

munities in San Diego county has 
a disadvantage as well, namely, a 
higher cost of living. La Jolla is 
not exactly a college town like 
Berkeley or Isla Vista. and the 
high cost of goods and services 
reflect that. High prices can be 
especially troubling to UCSD stu-
dents, who have to deal with both 
the rising cost of fees and the high 
price of pizza and parking. 

Being cheap or"cautious" with 
money is something with which 
almost every UCSD student can 
relate. Having to operate on a 
tight budget forces students to 
find more cos t-effective ways of 
spending their money. In the pro-
cess, they are left with the ques-
tion of how to maximize fun while

minimizing expenses. Theanswer 
to this ali-too-common dilemma 
is a crash course in creative bud-
geting, a way of life that all cost-
conscious students eventually 
embrace. 

"Our damn tuition is so expen-
sive, it forces us to be econom ical 
in our purchases." said Warren 
College senior Will iam Marumoto. 
"Cheap is good." 

Even in high-pricec! La Jolla, 
the frugal student can capitalize 
on discounts tailored to those who 
attend UCSD. There are many 
places in the immediate area that 
will give bargains to students for 
the sole reason that they are en-
rolled here. Deals for students 
range from discounts on food items 
to cheaper movie tickets.

Koala's Frozen Yogurt, which is 
located close to c:llnpus, give . tu-
dents a 15 percent discount. For 
those who are a~ conscious about 
health as they are about cost, 
Koala's offers nonfat and lowfat 
yogurt in a varielyoftlavorsand is 
a good alternative to the more deca-
dent desserts available at ice cream 
parlors. 

If you're a movie buff who is 
short on change, UTC Mann The-
aters give student discounts for 
selected films. You can actually 
see a fairly new Felease for Ihe 
price of a bargain matinee . For 
studenls who don ' Imind the drive, 
Fashion Valley Theaters offer 
$4.50 ticket prices to students 
{with an 10) for all , shows at all 
times. 

Various local restaurants within

student discounls. including the

ner of La Jolla Village Drive and

The Elept .1t Bar offers :1 20 
percent disc( unt with the use of a 
student discount ca rd , which is 
available at various campus lo-
cations including the Price Cen-
ter bookstore. 

Soup Exchange offers a 10 
percent discount with a student 
ID card. which means students 
can have all they can eat for $6.35 
plus tax. 

Marshall College senior Gabe 
Wachob said that a student dis-
count influences where he spends 
his money. "I would go [to Soup 
Exchangejless often ifthere [were J 
not a discount," he said. 

Although there are vendors who 
solic it student business exclu-
sively, there are also bargains to 
take advantage of at other San 
Diego businesses. This is the most 
important lesson to be learned from 
a crash cour. e in creative budget-
ing. "If you're cheap enough and 
look around, you ' ll tind a dis-
cou nt ," said Revelle College 
sophomore Mark Levin. 

UCSD students of legal drink-

Running from Thursday 

through Sunday at the San Diego

features over 4,000 vendors seil-
ing their wares at bargain base-
ment prices. From office supplies 
to antiques, plants to posters. fresh 
fruit and vegetable stands to used 
sporting equipment, the Swap 
Meel is probably the most diverse 
marketplace in the San Diegoarea. 
With a bargain admission price of 
50 cents on both weekdays and $1

a bargain which is hard to beat and 
not a half-bad way to spend your 
day, according to King. 

''It's a fun day activity," King 
said. "You can really make a day 
ofit,just people-watching. having

Students can buy anything from

and meaningless, but who really

"Good ref just don't make that

Triton Assistant Coach Larry Sand-

Nalu scored his only goal of the 
game early in the fourth quarter, 
completely burning his defender and 
Dillenbeck with a rocket backhand 
skip shot from the two-meter posi-
tion to narrow the gap to 10-9. 

"Nalu played a great game. I'm 
proud of the way he kept his compo-

Adam Krikorian extended the Bruin

then erupted with two lightning-

forgone conclusion. 

"We did a great job on Kellerman

Stem added another UCLA goal 
and Hegarty shelled a cross-cage

14-11. 

"It was a great game, very enter-

the CCAA at the CCAA DIvisional Championships with a time of 26:24. 

Divisional Championships. 
Head Coach Ted V an Arsdale 

made it clear that the team' s goal 
was to beat the Broncos. 

"We were really going for team-
work. The key was that we needed 
to beat Pomona's 3-4-5 teams," he 
said. 

And beat them they did - by a 
landslide. The women started off 
the day with another slew of per-
sonal records, paving the way for a 
third-place finish overall. 

Junior Karen Hinkle was the first 
Triton across the finish line, coming 
in with a personal besllimeofl8:39, 
which was good enough for 10th 
place. Freshmen Hilary Ferreira 
( 19: 10) and Chandra Boydstun 
(19:21), who also set personal 
records, finished 15th and 16th, re-
spectively. 

UCSD rea-'v took charge with 
their founh and fifth runners. Jessie 
Therriault (19:57) and Sara Lyn 
Ruffalo (20:07) both managed to 
beat theircounterpans from Pomona 
and set personal bests at the same 
time, clinching third for UCSDwith 
85 points. 

Therriault caught the praise of 
VanArsdale. 

"She showed a really significant 
improvement. Without [Hanna] run-
ning, there was a really big hole to 

fill, and we needed somebody to 
meetthechallenge. That was Jessie," 
Van Arsdale said. 

Though Ferreira, Boydstun and 
Therriault are all running in tl1\'; :· 
first year of cross-country CO Jl1 I' .. 
tion, Van Arsdale was counting on 
them to contribute to this big com-
petition. 

"Our concern was whether these 
girls could handle the pressure, but 
they certainly handled it well. I was 
quite pleased," Van Arsdale said. 

The men, whose race followed 
the women's event, were forced to 
deal with another unusual factor. 
Smoke from the recent fires in Riv-
erside was still lingering, and by the 
time the men took the course, it had 
thickened. 

J.1. Castner, struggling to over-
come breathing problems, still came 
away with an eighth-place finish for 
UCSD, with a time of 25:26. Al-
though his finish was not as good as 
he might have hoped, Van Arsdale 
said he admired Castner's effons. 

"He was running as loose as he 
was the week before, but he still 
managed to do a good job hanging 
in there and provided a strong kid. 
at the end," he said. 

The key to the men's sue, ,' · 
was their teamwork. John W:·I I 
(26:13), Bryan Leek (26:24) .. : .... 

Rhodes Walton (26:32) ranasatight 
group, finishing 13th, 14th and 15th, 
respectively. 

As a team, UCSD -was second 
overall with 67 points, while Pomona 
·.1 as third with 84 points. 

"The guys sure had the fever to 
race. They executed team running 
better than they have this year," 
Van Arsdale said . 

The next step for the Tritons is 
the Western Regionals, to be held 
two weeks from now in San Bernar-
dino. Van Arsdale used Saturday'S 
race to determine the best team to 
put out on the course . 

Physical setbacks of concern for 
UCSD are a knee injury to Hanna, 
which will most likely sideline her, 
and a foot injury to Jane Zimmerman, 
which will be monitored closely. 

Van Arsdale called the men's 
chances of qualifying for the Na-
tionals "really strong." Their main 
competition at the Regionals will be 
Claremont-Mudd-Scripps. The 
women will have a dogfight with 
Occidental College, which Van 
Arsdale ex pects to be "really tough." 

Only the top two women's teams 
and top three men's teams will 
qualify for the Nationals. Accord-
ing to Van Arsdale, "they both 
should qualify, but our goal is to 
win."

ball to the left post past Santa Cruz

sophomore took the ball Qn the left

and took three steps inside the box 
before firing. Wright had come half· 
way out of the goal to try to stop 
Ewert, but Ihe Triton's shot went 
high and left, bouncing in for u 4-0 
UCSD lead. 

Carbone picked up her third as-

when teammate Amanda Johnson 
took the ball at the top of the penally

Last year the Regals beat U~SD 
in the regular season, 2-0. The Tri -
tons returned the favor in spades 
when they handed Cal Lutheran a 3-

last year at UCSD. 

This year has been a season of 
ups and downs for the Tritons. They 
are an undefealed team, but one thai

f or UCSD it was an especially 

sweet victory to end a season that 
has proved that anything that could 
happen usually did. 

The Tritons only non-victory was 
a 0-0 tie to an inferior Claremont 
team that pointed out UCSD' s lack 
of any kind of scoring punch. 

Since that game there have been

questioned by McManus several 
iimes this season. 

The team finally put everything 
together yesterday with a 6-0 win 
over visiting UC Santa Cruz, and 
there is no question that the Tritons 
w ill have all the intensity they need

McManus has always stressed to

game. Five of the team's first six 
games went to overt i me, provi ng to 
Head Coach Brian McManu~ that 
" we never give up." 

The scoring deficiency has been 
fixed, th 'lnks mainly to Pugh and 
Ele Johnson. With her two assists 
yesterday, Pugh had 25 points on 
the season, while Ele Johnsoll, only 
a freshman, led the team thi s year 
with 31 points on 13 goals and ti ve

What kind of company works like that? Find out for yourself. 
Attend a speciaJ preview of the QUALCOMM story at 

6:00 PM, November 9, 
Santa BarbaraILos Angeles Rm., Price Center 
the night before our on-campus interviews. 

It's inleresting what happens when you give extraordinary people an extraordinary amount of 
autonomy and support. 

They innovate like crazy. Then their company takes off and grows like very few others have. 
Case in point: San Diego's own QUALCOMM. We've gone from 8 employees in 1985 to over 

1,200 today. That makes us one of America's fastest growing high-tech companies. 
It also doesn't hurt 10 have the company launched by communications visionaries like Dr. Irwin 

M. Jdcobs and Dr. Andrew J. Vilerbi. 
The trick, of course, is to keep the entrepreneurial spirit flOUrishing despite phenomenal growth. 

That's why we give our engineers as much freedom and encouragement as possible. This includes 
an open door policy company-wide, the latitude to set your own hours, the private space provided 
by your own office, and more. 

tn response, QUA LCOMM people have spearheaded many of our industry's most chaUenging 
technologies . . Among Ihem are mobile sateUite communication networks, dual mode (analog and 
COMA) mobile and portable phones, VLSI products, ful\-(Ustom ASIC design, low earth orbit 
sateWtes, and more. 

We'll throw in the ocean-free. 
Along with a highly stimulating work environment, you 'll also enjoy the Southern California 

lifestyle, which features one of America's most temperate climates. And QUALCOMM is less than a 
mile from the Pacific Ocean. 

If you're working towards a degree in Electrical/Electronics Engineering, Computer Science, 
Computer Engineering, Physics, Math or Manufacturing Engineering, be sure to attend our special

Tritons Nose Out Anteaters, 4-1 
MEN'S SOCCER: UCSD wins eighth straight by crushing Division I Irvine 
By Murall Moorthy 
Staff Writer 

Heading up to UC Irvine for 
Sunday's season finale against the 
Anteaters. Triton Head Coach Derek 

Armstrong 
had reason 
to be con-
cemed_De-
spite play-
ing solid 
gam e s 
against 
Azusa Pa-
cific and 
Biola last 
week, the 
offense 
could only 

create a total of three goals in the 
two victories. Furthermore, the Di-
vision I Anteaters were the victors 
in an ugly Triton performance last 
year. Another sloppy loss was the 
last thing Armstrong needed before 
this weekend's playoffs. 

A confident UC San Diego team, 
however, made it look simple with a 
4-1 thra.~hing. Perhaps it was too 
easy. 

"We made them look very ordi-

nary," commented Armstrong. 
"Frankly, I was a bit disappointed 
[by Irvine 's effort)." 

Armstrong couldn't have been 
more pleased by the show his own 
team put on. The Tritons were on 
the board within the first I 0 min-
utes. 

With the Irvine goalie playing 
in, Chris Romey showed off his 
upper-body power by launching a 
throw-in to the opposite end of the 
field where the "gOlll machine," se-
nior midfielder Todd Curran, was 
waiting to tip it in from 10 yards out 
for the early lead. 

With about five minutes to go in 
the firsl half, Romey scored his 15th 
goal of the season, a smash inlo the 
lower left comer from 16 feet out. 
Romey's return this year has been a 
primary factor in the turnaround 
from last year's dismal season. 

UC Irvine was able to score a 
goal of its own early in the second 
half. "raising" Michael Madden's 
goals allowed per-game average to 
0.84. But from five yards out, Brian 
Turner redirected Matt Chilton's 
hard crossing shot into the back of 
the net, dismissing any thoughts the 

Anteaters had of a comeback. 
Junior speedster Ken Fujii added 

insult to injury as he streaked down 
the field unchecked, fini shing the 
scoring with a low shot to the right 
comer. 

"The boys did the busines ," ad-
mitted Armstrong, proud of the 16-
2-1 regular season record. After en-
joying Sunday's victory, his con-
cerns will shift to "getting the boys 
ready to start the ' real' season." 

With starting mid fielder Joel 
Kosakoff out with a broken foot for 
at least the first round of the play-
offs, strong bench play from re-
placements Chung Vu and Jay New-
comer must continue. Stingy de-
fense and goal-tending have also 
been keys in the season-ending 
eight-game winning streak. 

With the first- and second-round 
matches to be played at UCSD this 
weekend, the team will look for a 
boisterous home crowd to extend 
the win streak against Gustavus-
Adolphus College on Saturday. A 
win there will have the Tritons play-
ing on Sunday against the winners 
of the Claremont vs. Colorado Col-
lege matchup.

YOWYBALL: Tritons slam Division II San Bernardino, Dominguez Hill 
By Aron Miller 
Associate Sports Editor 

Division II my foot! 
All season. the UCSD women's 

ol\eyba ll team has had its share of 
tough games: 
a three-se t 
loss to Divi-
sion LI power-
hou se UC 
Riverside. a 
fi ve-set se t-
back against 
Division lII' s 
top-ran ked 
Washington 
University in 
St.Louis 
squad and a 

beating at the hands ofNAIA main-
stay Pt. Loma Nazarene. 

Meanwhile, the Tritons have 
l'ompletely demolished nearly all 
Division rrr opponents to step in 
(heir path, amassing a phenomenal 
18-2 mark. 

Over the weekend, they showed 
a couple ofDivision n foes that they 
are a force to be reckoned with, 
regardless of division, thrashing 
CSU San Bernardino and CSU 
[')(\minguez Hills quite easily, rais-

ing their record to 20-9 and stretch -
ing their season-Iong winning streak 
to 10 games. The two victories gave 
San Di ego its first wins· of the year 
agai nst non-Di vision III teams. 

Friday night' scontest against Sun 
Bernard in o was an intriguing 
malchup, merely because the Coy-
otes (13- 1 I) had taught UCSD a 
lesson earlier in the year, sweeping 
the match in three quick se ts. 

The second ti me around, the Tri-
tons were more than ready 10 handle 
theCal State squad, turning the tables 
on the visitors and sweeping them, 
15-7, 16- 14, 15-13. 

UCSD dominated game one, 
bolting to a 13-1 advantage and 
cruising to a 15-7 win. 

Game two saw the TrilOns grab 
leads of 9-5 and 12-6, and hold on 
to take the set, 16-14. 

Outin front 2-0, San Diegocould 
have kicked back for a set, and at the 
beginning of game three it looked 
like that might just happen. 

The Coyotes went up early. 6-1 , 
then continued to lead at 11-6 and 
13-8. 

But the Tritons fought back to 
c.ollect the final seven points of the 
set to win the third game, 15-13. 

"Thb game ~how~ how much 
we've improved," UCSD Head 
Coach Doug Dannevik ·aid. "A 
month ago we weren'l beating teams 
like this."

In game two the Triton, took a

Tritons Must Bare 
Bruins 14-11 Victory 
WATER POLO: UCSD loses a Halloween h ()f1l C 
heartbreaker to fourth-quarter-surging VCL. \ 
By Brian K. Hutto 
Sports Editor 

All Hallow's Eve -an eerie full 
moon blinked in and out behind the 

dark west-
erly-trJveling 
clouds . 
Crowds of 
hungry fans 
poured into 
what they 
hoped would 
soon become 
a cold, watery 
grave for the 
visiting sixth-
mnkedUCLA 
men's water 
polo team and 

the most hideously hilarious cheer-
leaders in all Tritondom stepped 
upon a packed UCSD pool deck to 
weave noise-producing spells to 
awaken the slumbering spirit of UC 
San Diego sports. 

Last Saturday ' s headline 
matchup between the nalion's nimh-
ranked Tritons and the sixth-ranked 
Bruins had all the signs of an upset 
in the making. 

But UCLA rose above its would-
be tombstones. mounting a fourth-
quarter scoring spree to escape with 
a 14-11 triumph. 

After a brilliant defensive stand-
off anchored by goalie Andy Bruce, 

the Tritons' leading scorer, Mike 
Nalu, forced a kickout at two-
meters. UCSD ran the man-up op-
portunity to perfection V'hen George 
Hegarty rifled a shot to the upper 
left-hand corner of the cage to make 
the score 1-0. 

UCLA looked to· its top scorer, 
All-American Chris Kellerman, in 
the hole, but Nalu and Marc 
Giulianotti denied him any room to 
roam free. The Tritondefense forced 
the Bruins' offense to play the clock 
and rush shots that Bruce easily 
pulled down. 

Finally, Mark Sutter put UCLA 
on the board with a breakaway skip 
shot to tie the score at one. 

With only six seconds left on the 
shot clock, Nalu hit Trey Best, who 
slammed home a cross cage shot10 
make it 2-1. 

However. Sutter, on a Kellerman 
assist, answered back to tie it up 'at 
two. 

With only two seconds left in the 
quarter, UCLA goalie Kevin 
Dillenbock heaved a full-tank pa~~ 
to Jim Taring, who amazingly rose 
up and deflected the shot past a 
diving Bruce for the 3-2 lead. 

The Bruin defense keyed on Natu 
all night, blanketing him at every 
turn, forcing the re t of the Triton 
contingency to step up its scoring 
prowess. 

iYlI".UUW~II/ UuarOI8n 
Junior hole-set Mike Nalu was held to only one goal, but dished out three assists Ih loss to UCLA. 

Midway through the second 
quarter, Giulianotti caught 
Dillenbeck leaning toward Nalu in 
the hole and heaved a . perfectly-
placed two-point lob shot for a 4-3 
UCSD advantage. 

UCLAdidn'tfold.BruinBreuStem 
scored on two straight possessions, the 

~aMW-~st~~G~ 
to up the score to 5-4, 

AnotherNalu-forcedkickout setup 
a lob pass to Giulianotti on the left post 
to deadlock the score. 5-5. 

The Bruins sent a rocket bar-
L10wn shot tothe left side, and Taring 

converted a UCLA counter to run 
the halftime score to 1-5. 

Triton Andrew Steinheimer 
evened the score at seven with a 
two-point missile skip shot from 
more than 10 meters out to stan the 
third quarter. 

The two teams traded goals be-
fore Toring sent a bullet cross-cage 
upper right -hand comer shot to gi ve 
UCLA a 9-8 advantage. 

In what proved to be the turning 
point in the hotly-contested game, 
UCSD's Britt Miura was ejected, 
allowing the Bruins to run a man-up 

offense. UCLA attempted i\ cross 
pass to the right side of the .cage 
when Nalu, seemingly out of no-
where, rose high in the air, nagged 
the pass and pulled it down only to 
be mugged by the two Bruin post 
players. In a critical non-call by the 
referee, Stern picked up the garbage 
and nailed a left-corner shot past a 
bewildered Bruce. 

"That was a crusher," Triton 
Head Coach Denny Harper said. 
" You don ' t make thaI call. Nalujust 
played great defense. You don't pay

PHILIP 

MI[]{HEL~ 
Warriors' 
World B. Free 
Of Starters 

If it' s Monday. that must 
mean another Golden State 
Warrior is injured. 

They're dropping like fli es 
up in the city by the bay. For 
the Warriors, the NBA 
preseason has more closely 
resembled the Bataan Death 
March than a warmup for the 
regular eason. 

Fir t, Sarunas Marciulionis 
and Tim Hardaway battled it 
out to see who could tear more 
knee ligaments. Both were 
successful and are out for the 
season. 

On Saturday night, two-time 
Olympic gold medalist Chris 
Mullin tore a ligament in his 
finger while attempting to 
block a lay-up. Mullin, who 
collects injuries like some 
people collect trading cards, 
will be out for six weeks. 

So even before the fi rst tip-
off of a regular-season NBA 
game, the Warriors have again 
lost two all-stars and one of the 
most undermted guards in the 
game. And all this before Billy 
Owens' annual groin pull, 
which incidentally is consid-
ered a sacred holiday to some. 

When you add Chris 
Webber' s grumpy appendix 
into the mix, it doesn't look 
good for the team that many 
people were picking to take it 
all this year. Don Nelson is 
going to have to scramble just 
to find five healthy people to 
take the court. 

Maybe he can lure Tellis 
Frank back to fold, or the 
immortal Alto(l Lister could 
come out of retirement. Or, as 
long as Nellie still has a soft 
spot for his old Milwaukee 
Bucks players, Jack Sikma 
could don the blue and gold. I 
hear Joe Barry Carroll and 
World B. Free are looking for 
work. 

This is not to make light of the 
Warriors' situation. They were 
the unlucky winners of this year's 
preseason sweepstakes, in which 
teams compete in meaningless 
games to see how many players 
can suffer season-ending inju-
ries. Professional athletes better 
pray to their gods that Hillary 
Clinton gets that health-care 
package passed soon, because at 
the rate they're going, more play-
ers will be on injured reserve 
than on the roster.

off, Michelle Carbone took a comer 
kick for the Tritons and lofted a 
perfect pass that dropped right at the 
feet of a group of three UCSD play-
ers. The Tritons' Ele Johnson got 
her foot on it while Slug goalkeeper 
Lori Bryant stood around watching 
seemingly expecting Johnson to pick 
up the ball and give it to her for safe-

keeping. Johnson had other ideas 
and the Tritons were quickly up 1-0. 

Just three-and-a-half minutes 
later, Carbone and Johnson hooked 
up again. This time it was off a free 
kick given to UCSD on the left side 
of the field , about 35 yards from the 
goal. 

Carbone launched another high 
pass toward the right post, where it 
bounced before Johnson found it 
and converted for her second score 
of the first five minutes of the game. 

UCSD didn ' t score again in the 
fi rst half, but the team never stopped 
creating opportunities. Santa Cruz 
seemed bound and determined to 
help the Tritons, combining clumsy 
defense with an anemic offense that 
managed to record one shot for the 
game. 

The second half started out much 
like the first, only faster. UCSD's 
Carin Pugh took the opening kick 
and outran every Slug along the 
right side of the field, taking the ball 
to the goal line before centering to 
Johnson, who had been making her 
way up the center. Johnson notched

Tritons To Court Regals 
By Gregg Wrenn 
Senior Staff Writer 

Despite being the top-ranked 
team in the Western region and num-
ber four in the country, the UCSD 
women's soccer team will have to 
playa preliminary round game just 
to get a shot at playing in the re-
gional playoffs.

(14-4) Wednesday afternoon at the 

North Campus Fields. 
If the Tritons defeat the t{egals, 

UCSD must then travel to Minne-

Adolphus for the regional finals, 
Nov. 6-7.

the playoff announcement was 
shock. "If we're the number-one 
team, why do we have to play a

GUARDIAN ATHLETES-Of-THE WEEK 
Freshman Ele Johnson has had no trouble 

adjusting to the demanding world of college sports. 
When you get your own nickname as an athlete, 

you must be doing something right. 
This week she scored four times in two games, 

including one goal in the Tritons' overtime victory 
versus USC on Wednesday'and a hat trick against 
UC Santa Cruz on Sunday, which raised her team-
leading point total to 31. 

MShe's a great freshman," UCSD Head Coach 
Brian McManus said. MShe's been working like 
hell this season ... 

Senior Todd Curran, whom the UCSD men 's 
soccer team calls "the goal machine," netted 
three goals in three Triton wins, including the 
overtime game-winner against Biola on Tuesday, 
and goals versus Azusa Pacific and UC Irvine. 

MIt's a good time to start scoring, with the 
playoffs approaching," UCSD Head Coach Derek 
Armstrong said. MHe's feeling very confiden£."
