Experts weigh in 
on recall election 

Students protest upcoming

By NEIL SPEARS 
Senior Staff Writer 

While elephants and donkeys 
may not shoot out of cannons, walk 
high wires or perform trapeze acts, 
Ca li fornia 's Oct. 7 gubernatori al 
recall election has the potential to 
be a political circus, the likes of 
which has never before been wit-
nessed in this state. 

At least that's according to a 
handful of UCSD professors who 
have been earmarked by the uni-
versity as experts on the recall elec-
rion . Since the beginning of the 
recall process, these professors 
have been tapped by national news 
agencies as well as local televi ion 
and radIO stations to provide 
II1sight into the rapidly changing 
election scene. 

While the experts vary in their 
arguments, most assert that the 
reca ll provision of the tate consti-
tution was nOt intended to recall a

"My own view of the recall 

effort is that, in the final analysis .. . 
it's not about the budget cris is , it's 
not about difficulties that the 
California economy is experiencing, 
it's none of those things," history 
professor Michael Bernstein said. 
"Ie's really a very cold, calculated 
effort by the conservative wing of

Bernstein, a specialist in the eco-

UCSD students walked out of lectures and into 
Price Center for a protest againsr Proposition 54, 
the Classification of Race, Ethniciry, Color and 
National Origin Initiative, on OCt. I at 12:15 p.m. 
Approximately 250 srudenrs held signs and chanted 
as they walked around Price Center Plaza at the 
beginning of the rally, ending in front of the stage 
to listen to a succession of five speakers. 

The proposition, which would ban the collec-

studies have found that the more students !mow 
about Proposition 54, the more will vote against 
it," Vice President of External Affairs llarish

what the campaign is. The wording of the 
proposition is confusing, and we wanted to make 
UTe that people Imew what it was all about. " 

The first peaker was medicine prof, sor 

Jeffrey Gordon, who explained the implications 
of Proposition 54 from the standpoint uf the 
medical community. A cording to Gordon, both 
conservative and liberal health re provider are 
again t the initiative since it makes the collection 
of data almo I impossible, thus hindering 
advances in the fie ld of public health. Becau e

Prop 54: Med. professor 
speaks on medical impacts 

cOnlinued from page :l 
certain diseases occur more frequent-
ly in certain groups, it is necessary to 
know the background of the person 
diagnosed in order to prevent further 
spread, he said. 

Gordon also stressed the nega-
tive effects of Proposition 54 on the 
college community. 

"I think the experience at the 
university is made more fruitful by 
the diversity of the student body," 
he said. "To lose track of what the 
student body looks like would be 
disastrous to education." 

African American Student Union 
President Stephanie Akpa agreed 
with Gordon as she discussed the 
necessity for data collection in 
schools in order to remedy the 
inequalities that are found in ce.rtain 
areas populated by certain groups. 

"Realism is knowing that we live 
in a society where schools in South 
and Southeast San Diego don't 
have the same resources as other 
schools and it just happens that the 
students there are mainly students 
of color," Akpa said . "I want to ask 
why. I want answers, and that's why 
I'm voting 'no.'" 

David Artiss, director of the 
Academic Enrichment Program 
and president of the Ujima 

etwork at UCSD, took the stage 
to promote another forum about 
Proposition 54. He echoed other 
speakers'sentiments. 

"People who support this initia-
tive call it the 'racia l privacy initia-
tive'," Arti s said. "Let's not pre-
tend that we can have any privacy 
about race." 

Keith Morgan, vice president of 
the National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People of 
San Diego, also emphasized the 
necessity of statistics in combating 
racism in schools and in public life. 

Since Proposition 54 forbids the 
compiling of these statistics, this 
manner of fighting inequality would 
be lost, Morgan said. According to 
him, data collection by police is 
especially important in showing the 
numbers of minorities stopped by 
police. It is only with the collection 
of such information that racism can 
be seen, Morgan said. 

The final speaker, ethnic studies 
professor Charles Briggs, gave a 
brief history of data collection in the 
United States as a means to show the 
existence of racism. According to 
Briggs, it was the use of these num-
bers by people fighting for equality 
in the I 960s and 1970s that allowed 
them to prove that racial discrimi-
nation existed and that it was not 
the fault of the minority popula-
tions. Briggs said that the need for 
such data remains today . 

"Proposition 54 want!; to do 
away with the most important 
sources of numbers that demon-
strate the pervasiveness of racism 
in our society," Briggs said . "Neo-
conservatives will be able to claim 
that no racism exists because they 
have outlawed, at least in 
California, the major source of 
evidence that disproves their 
claim." 

T he ra lly finished with final 
chants led by the leaders of the rally. 

"We are pretty happy with the 
turnout and we are pretty positive 
that anyone who was there learned 
enough and will have enough com-
mon sense to vote against 54," 
Nandagopal said. 

Since the administration noti-
fi ed the A.S. External Affairs Office 
that using student fees to campaign 
against Proposition 54 would be 
against university policy, the rally 
was made possible by personal stu-
dent funds.

Morpheus: ResNet sees rise in file sharers 
cOnlinued from page I 

sa id he would also like to see a rise 
in tariffs on recordable CDs. 

"We want to see the artists get 
paid, and that's why these artists 
are here," he said. 

According to Nuell, the record-
ing label Kung Fu Records, to 
which Antifreeze and Audio Karate 
are signed and which partnered 
with Morpheus for the tour, saw 
fi le sharing help their sales. 

"They saw that files were being 
traded of Audio Karate before the 
record came out and sales actually 
were good," Nuell said. 

UCSD students ' responses to 
recent efforts to punish file shar-
ers have been mixed. 

"I haven't been downloading 
music from the Internet si nce I 
got to college because I'm afraid 
they're going to track me down 
for it," said John Muir College 
freshman Andrea Frenkel. 

Others are not changing habits. 
"I'm not scared," said 

Thurgood Marshall sophomore 
Lorant Najbauer. "I'll share 
everything I have, from copy-
righted movies to songs." 

According to UCSD policies, a 
first violation for sharing copyright-
ed material on the campus' network 

will warrant an email warning ask-
ing the student to delete the iUegal 
file and acknowledge the request. 

A second violation will cause 
that student's Internet connection 
to be temporarily severed until the 
problem is fixed. A third will sever 
the connection pennanently and 
the case will be referred to Student 
Policy and Judicial Affairs poten-
tially allowing the work's creator to 
bring legal action. 

"We don't run scans," said 
Academic Computing Services 
project manager Erik Strahm. 
"The recording industry or the 
movie industry will hire private 
companies to check for a certain 
song or movie, it will find out the 
IF address and will notify the uni-
versity that a machine on their 
network is sharing." 

According to Strahm, there has 
been a "huge increase" in file 
sharing at UCSD in the past year. 

"The number of times the 
industry now contacts us about 
violations can range from two to 
three a week to a couple hundred," 
he said. WEven though the indus-
tries are not currently going after 
people just downloading, there's no 
reason to think it's not around the 
comer." 

UCSD ResNet's Web site pro-
vides instructions for students to 
follow in order to disable sharing 
on Stich peer-to-peer programs as 
Kazaa, Morpheus, LimeWire and 
FileTopia. By having students do 
this, ResNet also aims to speed up 
campus connection speeds. 

ResNet is available as a 
resource for any student with 
questions or concerns about file 
sharing, according to Strahm. 

"Our job is to prevent sru-
dents from getting into trouble," 
he said. "ResNet is not the 
police." 

Morpheus will continue its 
campus tour in October with 
stops at UC Irvine, UC Santa 
Barbara, UC Berkeley and UC 
Davis in its effort to register stu-
dents to vote and express thei r 
concerns over file sharing. 

"The next battle will move from 
the court house to Capitol Hill," 
stated Michael Weiss, chief execu-
tive officer of StreamCast 

etworks, the developers of 
Morpheus. "We believe grassroots 
events are an effective forum to 
drive voter registration and to 
inform students about using tech-
nology responsibly and in a non-
infringing manner." 

Apps: Admission tests to include writing 
continued from page I 

national testing agencies' decision 
to change the content of their tests. 
Freshmen hoping to enter a UC 
campus in 2006 will be required to 
take a new SA T I that includes a 
writing exam, or the AC.T. with a 
new writing component and addi-
tionally rake two SA T. I1 tests 
instead of three as they do now, 
since one of these three is required 
to be a writing test. 

According to UC officials, 
these changes were made so tha t 
the admissions tests would be more 
closely aligned to high school col-
lege-preparatory curriculum. 

"Ths sends a positive message 
to California students, saying, 'stay 
in school, take challenging classes 
in high school, we'll test you on this 
subject matter," UC Spokesperson 
Hanan Eisenman said. 

Eisenman also noted the 

importance of the new writing 
components. 

"Writing is very important and 
provides us with a good sense of 
how well a student is going to do 
at the university level," he said. 

Mae Brown, assistant vice 
chancellor of admissions and 
enrollment at UCSD, agreed.

A.S. must exercise 
caution in lobbying 

N o matter what one thinks of Proposition 54, UC Regent Ward Connerly's 
ballot initiative banning the gov-
ernment's collection of racial data, 
student governments must be 
allowed to spend their money on 
lobbying issues pertaining to edu-
cation as they see fit. And accord-
ing to a court case that overturned 
the University of California's ban 
on student government political 
expenditures, they can. 

But UC administrators have 
still not clarified UC policy, plung-
ing UC Berkeley'S student govern-
ment into legal chaos. Berkeleys 
AS. Council has found itselfin hot 
water over the $35,000 it spent to 
combat Prop. 54, resulting in a 
legal drama that may culminate in 
the revocation of the student gov-
ernment's tax-exempt Status. 

UCSDs own AS. Council is 
very much in the same boat, having 
spent long nights over the past year 
preparing [Q fight Prop. 54. 

The A.s. Council recently 
received word From university 
authorities that it cannot spend 
money on the campaign, and sru-
dent activists who have been 
expecting reimbursements from 
the council for personal monies 
spent are now left out to dry. 

tudent governments must be 
allowed to advocate on behalf of 
students - if they cannot, what 
do they exist for? For this to hap-

pen, UC administrators must 
clarify policy guidelines to avoid 
these siruations in the future. 

Although it's quite neglectful 
of UC policymakers to drag 
their feet when updating policy, 
the blame doesn't rest entirely 
on UC authorities. 

The A.S. Council should have 
been more aware of the conse-
quences of political lobbying. 

So far, ASUCSD has done a 
good job of responding quickly to 
the legal crisis. A.S. Vice President 
External Harish andagopal has 
reorganized the campaign to 
ensure no student fees will be 
spent and has handed much of the 
financial respqnsibility to Youth 
Vote. He has also set up a system 
by which studen ts can get pro-
rated refunds for political advoca-
cy with which they disagree. 

However, the fact remains 
that activist students, expecting 
reimbursements for monies 
spent, will not get their money 
back. The A.S. Council should 
have been more careful in plan-
ning the campaign. Any time the 
council considers spending 
money on a controversial politi-
cal effort, it must take all possi-
ble measures to ensure that the 
money is spent legally. In the 
future, ASUCSD should pay 
closer attention to UC policy 
when deciding how to fight 
initiatives. 

Probe of CIA leak 
must be independent 

T wO months after (he CIA complained that the identity of an undercover 
agent had been exposed, the 
Department of Justice is still 
conducting a preliminary probe 
regarding the maner. On Sept. 
29, the White House denied that 
Karl Rove, President George W. 
Bush's tOP poli tical advisor, 
leaked the CIA agent's identity 
to retabate against an opponent 
of the adll1lnlstration's Iraq 
pobcy. 

Regardless of the validity of 
the claIm, the obvious conflict of 

illlere~t Involved in the Bush 
admInistration's inve tigation of 
ItS own enior officials merits the 
shIft of investigatIve respon ibil-
ity to either an mdependent 
councIlor a combmed I lou e-
Senate committee. 

Demo ratS are currently 
prodding the Ju~tlce department 
into con idenng a full investiga-
tion, pu hing for A tOrney 
General John Ashcroft to 
appoint a ~peclal counsel to pro-
ceed WIth the mquiry. Leadmg 

the pack of Democrats calling 
for an investigation are enate 
Minority Leader Tom DaschJe, 
and senators Carl Levin (D -
Mich.), Joseph Biden CD - Del.) 
andJay Rockefellec(D - W. Va .). 

The investigation is already 
two months old, and the justice 
department has conceded that 
there is no deadline for action . 
The issue is not whether the 
accusation merits fu rther study 
or not, but whom should con-
duct It and in which manner. A 
JUSt and Impartial investigation 
cannot be undertaken by a party 
with vested Interest in the 
results . 

Taking a more far-reachmg 
tance, there are perilous Ilnpli -

ca tions to both SIdes of the issue. 
If such methods of IntimIdation 
and force can be con Irmed, then 
the Bush admInistration should 
be condemned for its hamele~s 
abuse of power. And If Inve tiga-
tlons of an admmlstranon are 
undertaken by an even slIghtly 
bia ed parry, then the abu e of 
Justice IS JUst as great. 

Another tradition falls victim 
Warren writing changed from a pass/no 

pass sytem to letter grading this year, 
much to the chagrin of its students.

Recall sets bad precedent 
Political trend could undermine republic 

4 

BY MARIANNE MADDEN 
Staff V'hiter 

Under normal ci rcumstances, 
California is reliably anJ 
unabasheclly democratic. Al Gore 
won the state with 54 percent in 
2000 and ir even re-elected the 
uncharismatic Gray Davis after a 
troubled first term by five points 
over Bill Simon. Yet the present 
moment, of course, is not normal. 
The recall of Davis has gone from a 
Republican pipe dream to a state-
wide obsession, and in a matter of 
months, California's gone from the 
wacky but lovable Land of Fruits 
and Nuts to the cutthroat head-
quarters of Recall Mania. 

zinc The Economist, Gray Davis 
is "a disaster. II Too bad we re-
elected him barely nine months 
ago. Yet, in the long run , what will 
his recall - assuming it succeeds 
- accomplish? This is a question 
to be answered now, before we 
vote on Oct. 7. Conservative 
columnist Jonah Goldberg of the 
National Review opposes the 
recall on the grounds that it 
"undermines the accountability of 
voters, telling them in effect that 
they can have a do-over whenever 
they mess things up by electing 
the wrong guy; the people of 
California elected Gray Davis and 
now they mUSt be punished." 

held accountable, as they should be, 
then voters should be as well -
otherwise, what's the incentive in 
voting thoughrfully and wisely? 
(And, further, if we made such a 
grave mistake in reelecting Gray 
Davis, how do we know whether 
we've wised up in time to elect the 
best man for the job this time 
around?) This point is popular 
among Republicans, who see con-
tinuing time in office for Davis as a 
sure road to the suicide of the 
Democratic Party in California and 
possibly even a George W. Bush 
win in California in 2004 - a dis-
turbing thought to Democrats, 
indeed. 

In the words of British maga-
This principle of accountability 

is crucial. If elected officials are See RECALL, Page 6

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 2, 2003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Campus is not bicycle friendly 
Price Center "Centerpiece" a waste of paper 
horse's 
mouth 

EdWu 

C ome late September every year, the placid and serene beauty of the UCSD cam-
pus is shattered as thousands of 
underbrrads crowd back on to cam-
pus, their numbers increasing every 
fall as the fresh men unceasingly 
multiply. Even for those without 
agoraphobia. this can be rather 
aggravating - particularly so for 
tho e who commute to campus and 
get around by bicycle. As soon as 
the school year starts, one cannot 
hope to get across campus in five 
minutes, lest they run over some 
freshman that has not quite learned 
the dangers of walking down the 
middle of a pathway. 

Despite the fact that the 2002 
Transportation Parking 
Committee recommended to 
"expand bicycle network facilities, 
including marking bicycle lanes on 
Gi lman Drive, improving north-
south and east-west bike connec-
tions, and installing additional bike 
racks," no progress has yet been 
seen on better bicycle faci lities, and 
it still is a matter of course (espe-
cially at the new Eleanor Roosevelt 
College campus) to lock one\; bike 
to a railing in a pinch. "me Price 
Center bike racks near Espresso 
Roma are regularly filled to capaci-
ty during the day, and the enti re 
Warren Mall faces a regular dearth 
of bike parking. The problem is 
exacerbated when, for some 
unknown reason, evety third biker 

decides to put his tire in the middle 
of a U-bar bike lock stand, occupy-
ing twice as much space as is 
requi red to secure his bike. 

Instead of marked bike paths 
that would actually get students 
from one side of campus to another 
to beat the 10-minute passing peri-
od, all across campus there are still 
signs proclaiming "no biking" and 
"no skateboarding" areas on virnl-
ally every possible major north-
south throughway through the 
campus. And if a cyclist wants to 
legally traverse from the west side 
of campus to the east, he has to 
brave Gilman Drive and city bus 
drivers who like to play chicken 
with a four-ton advantage. 

The situation is entirely ludi-
crous. Instead of either banning 
bicycling on pedestrian paths out-
right and actually enforcing the 
rules, or putting up some expendi-
ture to create a safe and effective 
biking system with clearly delineat-
ed bike lanes running the whole of 
campus, the school instead insists 
on putting up a few meaningless 
signs as scarecrows and relying on 
the bikers to not run anyone over. 
This writer is lucky to have not hit 
any pedestrians in his time here 
(al though he has been hit by a car, 
which was not fun). 

Last issue of this fine newspaper brought with it a perennial attachment, the 
"Centerpiece" newslener, that no 
doubt co ts the University Centers 
an obscene amount of your student 
money (whether from fees or from 
money paid to vendors) to print. 
While this issue might be lauded 
for actually including some sem-
blance of useful information, like 

the new route of the Ciryshunle, 
one "front page story" in particular 
was galling: The comparison of 
prices at Price Center and the out-
side world - to prove that the 
Price Center is no more expensive. 

As proof, they sent a guy with a 
camera to a local Rubio's and a local 
Subway to show that, indeed, the 
prices in the Price Center matched 
exactly those of the outside estab-
lishments. Now, think about that 
for a second - when is the last time 
one can remember traveling our to 
Subway, of all places, for a cheap 
meal? 

Let us make a simple analogy 
here. Imagine, for example, that 
Orange County is filled with 
Mercedes and Lexus dealerships. 
The only cars you can buy in 
Orange County are those two 
brands, but you should not be 
expected to complain that prices for 
cars in OC are too high because, of 
course, the prices at those dealers 
match the prices at every Mercedes 
and Lexus dealerhip in California. 
You cannot make a rational com-
parison about prices with regard to 
the rest of the country if you do not 
have a Kia dealer across the street. 
Economics I, people: Price com-
parisons are based on an equal bas-
ket of goods compared between 
different regions. Your point is 
moot if every establishment you 
have is an "upscale" fast food place. 

College students know better 
than that. There is McDonald's, 
Roberto'S, the great Cori, or if all 
else fails, Ramen. It should by no 
means take over four dollars to 
feed a college student a decent 
meal that includes meat. Back in

OPINION 5 

Warren wrong to switch 
from pass/no pass 

Letters distract from learning 
By JESSICA UNGEL 

Opinion Editor 

When the Warren College 
Writing Program decided to switch 
from a passino pass system to a 
graded one, it ended the last 
mandatory passlfail class in the UC 
system. Quite a change from an 
instirution whose most competitve 
school mandated that all classes be 
evaluated by professor narratives 
only 30 years ago. And its possible 
that this trend spells a negative ten-
dancy within not just UC schools, 
but universities as a whole. 

The Comminee on Educational 
Policy, a branch of the Academic 
Senate, made the decision in April 
and reported it to Earl Warren 
College in aJune 9 memo. By then, 
it was far too late to raise the mat-
ter with the college faculty, which 
was not consulted at all. 

Many faculty members (and 
many students) believe that when a 
course is taken on a P INP basis, stu-
dents feel obliged to give greater 
attention to graded courses. The 
CEP decided that to allow a required 
writing course in any college to 
receive subordinate attention was, in 
their words, "intolerable." 

This goes largely against the 
school of thought that believes 
enforcing letter grades only encour-
ages students to worry about grades 
rather than the acrual material. The 
theory behind a PINP writing class 
was not to enable srudents to ignore 
their work, but instead to be able to 
focus on generating a writing ability 
rather than a grade point average. 

It could be argued that the CEP 
has been a bit underhanded in how it 

has handled the matter. It could be 
argut:d that the subsequent dissatis-
faction of Warren administrators 
could prove detrimental in the 
enaconent of these changes. It could 
be argued that such a transition 
should be instigated by the institu-
tion, which will most closely be 
affected by these changes. 

But it is perhaps even more per-
tinent to consider the effect that 
this decision will have on both the 
immediate and long-term spectrum 
of srudent welfare. 

Largely because of its gradua-
tion requirements that favor engi-
neering students, the student body 
at Warren College is somewhat 
inundated with a more mathemati -
cally minded demographic . For 
these students, Warren Writing 
lOA and lOB are vety possibly the 
only writing classes they will ever 
take, and one of the few humani -
ties-focused classes. The course 
serves as an introduction to argu-
mentative writing, but more impor-
tantly, the course is a lone mandato-
ry exploration of argumentation, 
writing and essay abilities. 

The change could be very posi-
tive if it results in students becoming 
more engaged with writing, since 
writing is probably the most impor-
tant thing one learns in school. 
However, the "low-risk" quality of 
the P P grading scheme has 
heretofore been part of the pedagog-
ical logic of Warren writing because 
it allowed students to focus on writ-
ing and not grades. 

Most Warren writing students 
are incoming freshmen, under a lot

6 OPINION THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Recall: Davis' ouster could lead to nationwide turmoil 
continued from page 4 

Yet, the recall's ill effects would 
not end with the message to voters 
that mistakes in an dection can be 
summarily (albeit expensively) 
erased. A successful recall would 
also send a message to elected offi-
cials nationwide that they're toast 
if their popularity isn't always 
comfortably high - in that case, 
they will have no incentive to take 
risks that could temporarily hurt 
their favor among voters for fear 
of being fired. This should be a 
frightening thought to 
Republicans and Democrats alike: 
every politician has enemies, and 
an encouraging precedent in 
California could very easily lead 
the entire nation into political tur-
moil and recall mania. 

There's no doubt that this 
recall is perfectly legal according 
to the law. That doesn't, however, 
mean it's fair. ~Mr. DaVIS needs 
50 percent of the vote to survive; 
any rival can win with a mere plu-
rality," The Economist points 
out. In true fairness - mostly 
fairness to the voters, who are in 
danger of ending up with a new 
governor that's even more 
incompetent and unpopular than 
Davis - the numbers should be 
adjusted. Davis' required per-
centage of votes should be low-

ered or changed to a plurality 
(that is, the greatest percentage 
of votes out of any candidate, but 
not necessarily a simple majori -
ty). But that would take time and 
thoughtfulness, and we're starved 
for both at this point. 

Further, a replacement would 
most likely win with only a sizable 
minority of the vote: say, 30 per-
cent. How would this new gover-
nor fare, inheriting a troubled state 
at an odd time and with only one-
third of the state's voters on his 
side? And what's to keep him from 
being recalled if he makes any sort 
of mistake? Putting a man in office 
with a minority vote is a recipe for 
discontent and upheaval, which is 
precisely why it's barred under 
normal circumstances. 

It's also a bad idea - and a dan-
gerous precedent - to recall some-
one who hasn't done anything ille-
gal or unconstitutional. Davis sure 
made mistakes, but the eyes of the 
law are a lot more reliable than the 
whims of fickle voters in judging 
whether an official should be fired. 
He hasn't done anything that he 
can't work to correct. By gum, if he 
got us into this mess (and if we 
voted him into the job) he should 
dig us out. Living with our choices 
as voters is a permanent, and some-
times painful, duty. 

All these points may seem moot 
at a time when a successful recall 
seems all but inevitable. Yet most 
polls show that only about 55 per-
cent of people are in support of a 
recaU. In addition, major California 
newspapers - including the Los 
AT/grles Times, San Jose M~ry 
News, Odland Tribune, and 
Sacrammto Bee - are all recom-
mending a "no" vote on the recall. 

The San Diego Union-Tribune 
urged a "yes" vote in an editorial 
and endorsed Arnold 
Schwanenegger as a replacement. 
This is unsurprising, as San Diego 
is a pocket of conservatism in 
California and the home of Rep. 
Darrell Issa, Daviss political rival 
and a $1. 7 nnillion donor to the 
recall campaign. 

T he very Republ icans who 
brought the recall against Davis in 
the first place, including lssa, are 
now waffling in their suppon. Issa 
worries that wi th both 
Schwarzenegger and State Sen. 
Tom McClintock (R - Thousand 
Oaks) representing the GOP as 
replacement candidates, the 
Republican vote will be split and 
Davis will simply be replaced with 
another Democrat. This scenario is 
entirely possible, despite 
Schwarzenegger's considerable 
popularity over McClintock and 

McClintock's rigid conservative 
brand of Republicanism that repuls-
es most liberal California 
Republicans. Thus, Issa is advising a 
"no" vote on the recall, barring the 
exit of a GOP chaUenger. 

Schwanenegger, of course, is 
the GOP chaUenger who shows no 
signs of backing off - on the con-
trary, he's all set to "take 
Sacramento back from the politi-
cians." Never mind that he is a 
politician now whether he likes it or 
not, and a smooth-talking, shrewd 
one at that. Arnold appeals to 
California's love of star power and 
brawn, and despite his obvious sim-
ilarities to Ronald Reagan his brand 
of Republicanism is liberal, espe-
cially on social issues. 

After the initial titters when he 
entered the race, Californians' cries 
of "He's the Tenninator, dude!" 
have come to mean that we like 
him. We like him a lot, or perhaps 
we just take a perverse thrill in 
imagining an actor who special izes 
in playing a robot as the leader of 
our state. Either way, we're set to 
give old Gray the boot and touch 
off a nationwide fad of recalling (or 
at least threatening) unpopular offi-
cials. Perhaps this time around we'll 
learn than a bit of careful voting is 
much easier to undertake than a $25 
million circus. 

Grades: Writing course gave freshmen a respite from stress 
continued from page 5 

of pressure to acclimate to college 
life, to San Diego, and to an inde-
pendent living situation. Of course 
uch considerations shouldn't merit 

3 free ride wough your first year, 
but its Similarly obvious that there 
are pressures that first year that dis-
appear after a quarter or two. If 

Warren writing can provide an 
escape from the grade-chasing, 
GPA-mongering attitude that dom-
inates the first-year experience, 
then 0 much the better. 

There are few opportunities 
officially allowed to foster an envi-
ronment without the added stress 
of grades. Those chances should 

be encouraged rather than 
demolished. 

The CEP has made a mistake in 
forcing the switch &om PINP to 
letter grades. This was a chance for 
students to learn without feeling 
overwhelmed, to value ability rather 
than success. The focus of educa-
tion may have changed to Vlllue 

grades over aptitude, and the pre-
vailing tendency may be to think 
that GPAs define academic succe s. 
But that doesn't make tho e persua-
sions valid. Srudents have the next 
four years to be convinced of the 
importance of grades. It shouldn't 
be enforced &om their very first 
course.

ily-owned burger stands that 
would serve up artery-c1ogging-
sized hunks of beef for less than a 
coupl e dollars . The "Centerpiece" 
should know bener than to try 
cramming the notion that $6 to $7 
is an entirely reasonable minimum 
for food to be shoved down the 
throats of students . 

The waits fo r food are atrocious 
as it is, and the university embarks 
upon building another upscale din-
ing establishment, a]apanese restau-
rant. Nothing against Japanese food, 
but in this writer's experience, it has 
always been equated with much less 
food for much more money. If the 
lines are so bad, why can't they just 
allow several of t110se simple greasy 
meal trucks to wheel up onto campus 
during lunch hours? If they are good 
enough to feed the people in Balboa 
Park, then they should no doubt feel 
right at home among college stu-
dents. Where the hell is a simple hot

THURSDAY. ocrOBER 2, 2003 THE U SD GUARDIAN 

Recall: UCSD professors examine gubernatorial election 
conrinued from page I 

intended to allow wealthy people 
like Darrell Issa to hijack the will 
of the people in a major state like 
this. " 

Issa, a Republican member of 
the U.S. House of Representatives 
from north San Diego County, 
garnered media attention early in 
the recall process by using over S 1 
million of his own money to hire 
signature gatherers across the state 
to obtain the signatures needed to 
call a special election. 

Thad Kousser, an assistant 
professor of government at 
UCSD, said that whi le almost 
every initiative in California is the 
result of a group or individual 
putting forth large amounni of 
funds, the recall election proves 
that "if you've got a million dol-
lars, you can get just about any-
thing on the ballot. 

"But that doesn't invalidate 
the fact that close to 2 million 
Californians thought it was a 
good idea to have a recall , and 
more than half of people, given 
the current polls, think that the 
recall is something that they're 
willing to support," Kousser said. 
"I don't think it's fundamentally 
undemocratic that there was 
some money involved in the 
process." 

Other experts, like political sci-
ence professor Gary Jacobson, 
were cautious not to place blame 
on one party. 

"In one sense, it 's a Republican 
coup. They couldn 't win the elec-
tion, but they're hoping that 
they're going to win a re-run of it 
with a different candidate," 
Jacobson said. "On the other 
hand, people were really upset 
with Gray Davis and this is an 
opportunity for them to ex pres 
that unhappiness." 

n Election Day, voters will be 
faced with a two-part ballot. The 
first item is the recall question . 
The econd item includes a ran-
domly ordered list of the 135 can-
didates vying to replace tile gover-
nor if he i recalled. 

"ThiS is a two-candidate race 
and it's always been a two-candi -
date race on the second part of 
the ballot," Kousser said. " 0 
while it may be a little bit hard to 
find peoples' name and while a 
few people may be tempted to 
vote for their wacky neighbor, I 
think mo t voters in California 
are smart enough to pick out 
[ArnoldI chwarzenegger or [Lt. 
Gov. Cruzl Bustamante from the 
long list." 

omplicating the race further 
wa a ruling by a three-judge panel 
of the inth Circuit Court of 
Appeals on Sept. 15 that the elec-
tion could not be held as sched-
uled because of outdated voting 
equipment that would disenfran-
chise voters in six counties. An 11 -
judge panel of the same coun later 
reversed that decision. 

ommunicatiol1s professor 
Dan l !allin explained that the 
COlirt \\fa fa cd with a "no-win" 
ituation. 

"It's very lear that the election 
actually i an unfair election," said 
( !allin, an expert on political com-
munications and the media . 
"Because you have these old-fash-
ioned v ring machine in certain 
pia es, there really arc olne v ters 
lhat are di enfranchi cd . n the 
other hand, if the coun were to 
delay the election, [ think that a I t 
of people would feel really angry 
about that." 

Kou ser aid that the added 
medi 3tlenti n crea ted by the 
court's rullOg 11lIght actually lead 
to an Increased voter turnout. 

The experts dee III the structure 
o f the twO debates and many tele-
vIsion spot typi al of a gubernato-
nal election. I Iowever, the large 
number of minor ca ndidates has 
added new {hmenslon to candi-
date ' media outreach. 

"It was kind of refreshing to 
have a wider range of candidate 

than you usually have," Hallin 
said. "You had more points of view 
and not such bland points of view 
reflected than you do in a lot of 
debates." 

Kousser, however, found the 
contrast "between the circus and 
the dysfunction of the debate and 
the sort of elevated public dis-
course of the court decisions ... 
kind of ridiculous. It wasn't an 
enjoyable debate for me to watch, 
even for a political junlcie." 

If the recall effort is successful, 
professors worry it may become a 
political weapon that will be used 
again in the fun .re. 

"The Democrani are not going 
to have amnesia about the way this 
recall was used," Kousser said. 
"Every 10 years in California . 
we've had a big fiscal crisis and the 
nen time this comes around, it 
certainly is an arrow that the 
Democrats might pull out of their 
quiver." 

Student reaction to the recall is 
mixed. 

John Allison, chair of the 
Conservative Union, finds Davis' 
actions disappointing. 

"While I recognize things like 
the Internet bubble that burst and 
being caught with our pants down 
in the electricity crisis, Mr. Davis 
really did not come out as a 
leader," Allison said. 

However, Kate Maull, presi-
dent of the Campus Democrats, 
called the recall an attempt to 
reverse a legitimate election. 

"I don 't think (the recall elec-
tion] is democracy," Maull said. "I 
think eight million people going 
to the polls and voting for their 
governor is much more legi'timate 
than people being harangued into 
signing the (recall] petition in 
front of a Target store." 

No matter who becomes gover-
nor, UCSD experts foresee the 
future governol' being plagued by 
the same problerru that Davis &ced. 

"There is nothing in the 
process thats going to solve the 
problems that Davis fac.ed or that 
the state's faced in terms of its bud-
get, that the university faces in 
terms of its budget, etc.," Jacobson 
said. "Whoever ends up there, 
they're going to face the same sort 
of problems, which are that there's 
not enough money and there's too 
much demand on it; and if you're 
going to balance the budget. its 
going to involve some very painful 
draconian cuts or some tax increas-
es, or both." 

Even partisan politics are tak-
ing a different form for this recall 
election. Issa, who ended his cam-
paign to replace Davis before the 
filing deadline, encouraged 
Republicans at one point to vote 

against the recall in order to avoid 
replacing Davis with Bustamante. 
Independent candidate Ari2nna 
Huffington, who withdrew from 
the race on Sept. 30, has also 
switched to campaigning against 
the recall. 

"This will not be a mandate to 
govern, it will not be a mandate to 
drive the legislature forward . This 
will be a circus," Bernstein said . 
"What one can then hope for is 
that not too much damage is done 
before the next formal gubernato-
ri21 election, when we can have a 
real campaign. Then the state can 
make its decision." 

On-campus residents who are 
registered to vote in San Diego 
can cast their ballot in Half Dome 
Lounge, located in the Muir 
Apartments near the Muir College 
Center, between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. 
on Oct. 7. 

Students living off campus can 
find the location of their polling 
place printed on the bacle of the 
sample ballot that was mailed ear-
lier this month, or at the San 
Diego County Registrar of Voters 
Web site, bttp:lfruww.sdvote.com. 

Absentee voters must mail 
their ballots in time to be received 
by their county election office 
before the polls close on Oct. 7. 
Postmarle dates are not accept-
able.

you to know how to write," Brown 
said. "I think adding a writing com-
ponent will benefit students." 

San Diego Senior H igh School 
college counselor Nirit Vardi said 
she believed students she counsels 
are looking forward to it. 

"It's one less test they have to 
talee which m2kes them feel better," 
she said. 

The move to online applic.ations 
will be required sooner, starting 
with the incoming class of fall 2005 . 
The California State University 
system will be moving to online 
applications as well. 

In 2003 -04, over 70 percent of 
UC and CSU applications were 
completed online. 

According to Vardi, the majori-
ty of her past students have found 
the online application to be more 
convenient than the paper one, due 
to electronic error checks that don't 
let students submit the application 
if any part of it is missing. 

"Our students in that year will 
definitely be dealing with a lot," 
Vardi said.

Towers: Environmental 
impacts to be studied 

cominucd from page I 
need to amend the specific plan ." 

The change, called the pecific 
Plan Amendment, would allow the 
land to be desIgnated as commer-
cial/visitor and high-den~IlY multi -
family area. The proposed devel -
opment includes four buildings 
that would create one 36-story 
building about 350 feet tall, twO 
36- lOry bllildll1gs approximately 
3 0 feet tall , and one tower that 
would be 43 stones and approxi-
mately 455 feet tall. 

The tower would create up to 
200 residential units and also pro-
vide approximately 1,909, 143 
square feet of multi -family resi-
dential development. T here are 
also plan to provide four four-
level subterranean parking struc-
tures that would yield spaces for 
1,934 vehicles. 

The plans for development are 
also required to have a communi-
ty plan amendment, a planned 
development permit, site devel -
opment permit and further re-
zoning. According to project 
manager Tim Daly, the staff is 
currently looking at a resubmitted 
version of the proposal. He al 0 
said that the process is expected 
to take some time . 

After each review. the plans 
must be resubmitted with the 
modi fica tion . \-"hen all aspects 
of the development are finalized, 
a hearing will be held to deter -
mine whether to deny or approve 
the project The decisioll for this 
specific project will be made by 
the San Diego City Council at the 
end of the review process. 

" We sent them back a letter 
with a slew of items," Daly said. 
"It was just a myriad of informa-
tion on design, some needs for 

clarifications on square footage of 
units, landscapi ng, parking set-
backs and Just to make sure that 
l11unicipJI code~ would be Illet." 

The departillent staff IS ,lIso 
recollimending that an environ-
mental lillpact report be drafted 
to determine the effects of such 3 
project on the environment. The 
report will include an analYSIS of 
how the developmcnt will affect 
traffic, air quality, hydrology and 
water quality. An EI R takes about 
a year to be completed. Aftcr an 
EIR is drafted, rhe projecr can 
then go on to the hearing for 
approval. 

"Analy is for the EI R is still 
goi ng on," Elizabeth Shearer-
Nguyen of the department said. 
"We've done a preliminary study 
due to the type of projec t and the 
substantial impact on the envi-
ronment." 

After determining that the 
project would need an EIR, the 
department also held a publi c 
scoping meeting on July I to dis-
cuss any concerns from the com-
munity. At thi time, there have 
been minimal reactions regarding 
the project. 

"We sent notices to those that 
would be within a 30D-foot radius 
of the project, and I have n't 
received any feedback," Daly said. 

For some who live in the Costa 
Verde Apartments, construc ti on 
in the neighborhood would not be 
a big issue. 

" It sounds pretty nice," said 
Earl Warren College junior 
Felipa Rodriguez. " It's kind of 
quiet around here so that might 
have an effect , but I don't think 
people will mind."

S oCal stOllcr band Thc Phan.yde was formed when the original quartet Imani Vli lcox, Bootie Brown (Romye Robinson), Slim Kid (Tre Hardson) and Fat Lip (Derrick 
Stewart) met at the apartment of music teacher Reggie 
Andrews, a place where many hip-hop hopefuls would seek 
guidance. Hardson, Robinson and Wilcox were working as 
dancers and choreographers for the television show "In Living 
Color," and Stewart was trying to malc.e it as a rapper. There, 
the four met producer J-Swift. who helped them cut a demo 
tape. The fledging group had talent and natural chemistry and 
they swiftly found themselves at the center of a bidding war. 

MIDTOWN COMMON 

After signing with Delicious Vinyl , the group released its 
first album, BiZll1Tt RUk IJ in 1992 . The album was remark-
able in that it strove to employ more tomfoolery than tragedy 
and more raucousness than rage, a far cry from most of the 
west coast rappers of the time whose lyrics often dealt with 
the harsh realities of life on the streets. The Pharcyde pre-
ferred to rap about schoolyard anecdotes, the joys of mari-
juana and even about love. One of the big singles off of that 
album was "Ya Mama," which consisted of a series of insults 
trlIded by the band members with ever increasing amounts of 
enthusiasm and absurdity. The group was favorably com-
pared to legendary hip-hop groups A Tribe Called Quest, 
Dream Warriors, Mas Def and The Roots. 

Not wanting to rush their creative process, which is said 
to consist of smoking pot and freestyling, The Pharcyde 
waited three years to release its second album, 
ubcl1bin(l1/ijornil1. It had a smoother and jazzier sound than 
the debut, and The Pharcyde was compared to arti ts as 
diverse as Neil Young and Bob Marley. 

Af[er the second album, the band began to drift apart. 
Slim Kid left because of creative differences. The remaining 
members released the EP 1tIting tht WaItT.!' in 1999, but 
when 2000's Plain Rop was released, Fat Lip had already left 
to pursue a solo career. However, the Pharcyde went on to 
release a best-of collection, CydtWl1Ys, in 200 I and have con-
tinued to tour, showing a remarkable tenacity in spite of 
membership instability.

Quite captivating, somewhat mysterious and ki nd of clever are precisely the traits Midtown uses to describe its blend of emo, punk, pop and rock music. The band mates Tyle: 
RallO (guitar and vocals), Gabe Saporta (bass and vocals), Heath 
Saraceno (guitar and vocals) and Rob Hitt (drums) decided to 
first solidify their friendship by writing songs, in order to form 
a stronger bond as fellow members of a band . They fonned in 
1998 during the founding member's freshman year at Rutgers 
University. They discovered they had several things in com-
mon, including their passion and serious approach to making 
music, in addition to the fact that they are all vegetarians and 
strong supporters of animal rights. 

The foursome soon released The Sacrifice of Lift, an EP that 
consisted of five songs. During this time, they started playing 
weelcly shows throughout the Northeast. The band gained a 
light fan base with its rowdy stage antics, and the way in which 
the members would all trade off lead vocals. Around this time, 
indie Drive-Thru Records in California heard the EP, signed 
the band, and invited it to come [0 Los Angeles to record a full 
album. In January 2000, with Rutgers behind them, they 
recorded Sl1Vt Tht World, uu Tht Girl and continued touring 
with acts such as New Found Glory, J immy Eat World, Saves 
the Day and The Hives. 

Midtown~ sound can best be defined as a quiclc, fun , harmless, 
and in some cases, a contagious rendition of tunes by bands like 
Jimmy Ea[ World and Blink 182. Like Jimmy Eat World, 
Midtown seems to focus mostly on creating distinct harmonies. 
Although the sound is somewhat light and airy, the band's lyrics 
tend to be a bit more hard hitting. 

In 2002, Midtown released another LP, Uving mil Is Tht Best 
Rromgt, and are currently on tour promoting the record. In 
Saporta's words, "The world is changing. People are looking for 
something with a little more substance and less metal posturing." 
If you are looking for something a bit different than the average 
band, see whether or not Midtown lives up 10 its promise.

Common was raised in Chicago's south side and was innu-enced by the soulfu l music he heard while groWlng up. When he got the opportuni ty to let his voice be heard 
through music, he made sure it would have a heavy soul 
influence. He debuted under the name "Common Sense" as 
a reflection of his lyrical insights. 

His first album, Can I Borrow 11 Dollar?, was given positive 
reviews but received little attention among the mainstream 
outside of the single "Take it EZ." His sophomore release, 
RtJ'UrTtcriun, was given even better reviews, and Common 
amazed critics by not falling into the sophomore slump typ-
ical of so many hip-hop artists . 

His most recent releases, LI/tt Waltr for Cho(o/att and 
E/mri( Circus, have also been well-received and have 
found a niche audience. "The Light, " a si ngle off Likt 
Wartr for Cho(o/l1u, was played heavily on radio and its 
accompanying video received heavy rotation from MTV 
and B.E.T. His current girlfriend, Erykah Badu . was fea-
tured in it and the two have collaborated on songs ever 
since. 

Eltctric C Ircus, which was released in late 2002, does not 
stray far from Common's poetic style. The aJbum includes 
the single "Come Close," featuring Mary J. Blige, and found 
commercial success similar to that of "The Light." Common 
combined his lyrics with production mainly from The 

eptunes and ?uestlove from The Roots to give him a main-
stream, yet unique sound. The most recent exposure 
Common has had has been alongside R&B singer Mya in an 
omnipresent Coca-cola ad in wnich the two duet. 

Common is also an accomplished break-dancer, and has 
been known to show off his skills during live sets. He has 
the ability to battle rap on one track, talk about the distress 
in the ghetto and then express his love for hi lady on the 
next. His performance on Oct. 3 will be a unique experi-
ence, considering not many well-known hip-hop artists 
come to UCSD.

10 HIATUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY. ocr BER 2. 2003 

Underage sexpots enhance 
personal insecurities 

Profit-seekers and Olsen tvvins give the 
unsuccessful a major complex 

The sounds of West Africa come to UCSD 
Drummers to put on a wildly entertaining, upbeat show 

short kids 
are cool 
Jessica Kruskamp 

It' the ultimate pass-the-blame chain: There is a guy I know, who knows a guy, whose 37-
year-old uncle allegedly bought 
the Hillary Duff album. 

Seems normal enough. After 
all, she's gOt all the marketability 
one could ever want. But then 
the story takes ~n eerie, decided-
ly creepy turn when this particu-
lar cousin allegedly wallpapered 
his room with the free Duff 
poster that came with the CD 
purcha e, adding to his already 
impressive Britney/X-
TinalBeyonce collection. There 
he lay gazing upon her blonde 
16-year-old glory while listening 
to the album - on the repeat. 

Allegedly. 
\¥hen did taboo voyeurism 

become normal consumerism ? 
Most of society has heard the 
tired-yet-releva nt adage that 
American culture is sexualizing 
its youth to sell goods. Even 
more specifically, powers-that-be 
are stealing the mnocence of that 
youth, turning the female virgin 
to vamp. 

Another major problem [ 
have, however, relates to my own 
selfish, materialistic desires . 

My own mortality is wrapped up 
in these underage sexpots. That 
nice Duff girl, styled within an 
inch of her life, is my personal 
demise in a pair of factory-faded 
hip-hugging Seven jeans. 

I'm 20 years old. In my 20 
years on Earth it's affinnative that 
no one will ever make a poster of 
me. It's a likely possibility that I 
may be jobles after graduation. 
And its 99 percent guaranteed I 
will never record an album -
unless being fully untalented sud-
denly becomes terribly in vogue in 
the very near future. 

Once upon a time, I accepted 
all those facts at face value, charg-
ing ahead through life, aware th.at 
The Industry wanted me to be a 
"normal consumer" and I'm doing 
my best to not conform. I go 
about my own consuming habits, a 
few years pass, and bam - all of a 
sudden really, really young people 
are way, way more successful than 
me. 

(Depending, of course, on the 
measurement of success that one 
prefers to use. For the purpose of 
my current mood, success equates 
to fame, money and the number of 
posters sold. Here, success is not 
measured in the meaningful, 
touching-people-until-they-are-
overcome-with-emotion sense.) 

It's the Hillarys, Mary-Kate 
and Ashley's that are everywhere, 
displayed in full nubile splendor. 
After all, there's nor a real rush to

Think of the loudest concert you have ever been to and then take away the gui tars, the bass and 
any other accompanying instru-
ments. That leaves you with the 
drums and the lead singer. Now 
crank that up to a crescendo that 
alters the natural rhythm of your 
heart and you will barely be close 
to the power of the Drummers of 
West Nrica, who will be perform-
ing in Mandeville Auditorium on 
Oct. 5. 

The Drummers of West Nrica 
hail from Senegal, a country 
roughly the size of South Dakota, 
located on the Ivory Coast of West 
Africa. It is a tropical country and 
has long had a reputation as an 
international peacekeeping nation. 
Centuries ago the art of drumming 
was used by the Senegalese people 
as means of communication as one 
village would convey the threat of a 
fire, for example, to a neighboring 
town by using their drums. Today 
drumming is taught and practiced 
as a way to maintain Senegalese 
cultural heritage. 

The H-member Drummers of 
West Africa is led by the 74-year-
old Doudou N'diaye Rose, a 
national celebrity in his native 
Senegal. Rose began drumming at 
16, much to the chagrin of his 
accountant father. [n addi tion to 
being the leader of the world 
famous Drummers of West Africa, 
Rose has also participated in the 
Senegalese arional Ballet as a 
percussionist and helped develop 
the rhythm of the Senegalese 
national hymn. Over the course of 
the years Ro e's skills as a percus-

sionist have become world 
renowned, and he has become an 
unofficial cultural ambassador to 
Senegal. 

"He is an incredible person," 
said the Drummers' tour manager 
Stephan Brunet when asked about 
Rose. "He is very old, but on stage 
he is like a young boy." Brunet fur-
ther added that Rose is "short and 
tiny, but when he is behind his 
drums he looks like a monster." 

All the members of the 
Drummers of West Africa are 
related to Rose, the youngest being 
a 16-year-old who has already mas-
tered the ancient language of the 
drums. The 20 women of the 
troupe are following a tradition 

starred by Rose who decided that 
women should also be drummers, a 
talent previously only held by 
Senegalese men . 

In addition to introducing their 
audiences to the ancient rhythms of 
Senegal, the Drummers also wear 
traditional costumes and perform 
barefoot. Singing is also incorpo-
rated into the performance pieces 
but the central components are 
always the drums. The Drummers 
use the traditional saber, a tall 
drum covered in goat skin which is 
played with one hand and a stick 
made from wood called soumpe 
that is only found in Senegal. The 
Drummers are so ferocious with 
their performances thal they are 
known for breaking drumsticks and 
ripping drum skins during their 
shows.

repertoire that promises to be 
especially exhilarating is "Sabar," 
which capitalizes on the precision 
of the troupe and their ab ility to 
follow Rose's directions amidst the 
roar of the drums. 

"This part is the most powerful 
of the show," said Brunet. "Mr. 
Rose is in the middle of the stage 
and he directs so fa t [that] every-
thing changes in half a second or 
less. It is very loud." 

In Senegal , the Drummers have 
been known to perform for upwards 
of six hours, however, the perfor-
mance on Oct. 5 will only be one 
hour and 30 minutes, barely enough 
to fully appreciate the an and power 
of.the Senegalese drumming. 

"In an hour and a half you go 
deeply into the African culture," 
said Brunet. "The time passes 
quickly." 

The strength of the Drummers 
can be previewed on their CD 
Djabote, which will also be sold 
after the show. The Drummers of 
West Africa will perform on Oct. 5 
at 7:30 p.m. in the Mandeville 
Auditorium. Ttclcets for students 
are $15, general admission is $23 .

'School of Rock' full of music and fun 
Musician Jack Black is a perfect fit for the newall-ages comedy 
By ANNE CONCi-HUYEN 

Hiatus Editor 

It could have been an affro nt to muic fa ns and parents every-where, but J ack Bl ack manages 
to take a potenti ally dangerous and 
disas trou premise for a film - a 
loud and large middl e-aged failed 
musician who rurns a classroom of 
IO-year-old prep-school lcids into a 
rock band - and make it the fun, 
feel -good movie of the season. 

ure, it is cheesy and corny, bur 
Black is hilarious as the overgrown 
child and aspiring rockstar Dewey 
Finn, and the lcids are amazing to 
watch. 

ranted, it is not incredibly 
original and is disappointingly 
mainsrream for veteran indie direc-
tor Richard Linklater ("Dazed and 
Confused" and "Waking Life"), but 
if you are in the mood for a illy 
laugh and some serious talent, then 
"School of Rock" is the movie to 
see. 

Although it may not be entire-
ly due to his talent, Black portrays 
the lazy drunkard Dewey in an 
eerily realistic manner and his 
transformation from squalid goof-
ball to earnest music teacher is a 
realistic and engaging trajectory. 
Through his very vocal and equal-
ly physical performance, Black 
shows how Dewey goes from 
being an apathetic temp to a guy 
willing to say to a mob of angry 
parents, "Your kids have touched 
me, and I'm pretty sure I've 
touched them tOo." Lucky for 
him, "School of Rock" serves as a 
perfect place for him to showcase 
his own musical talents . For those 
fans of Tenacious D, this film will 
not disappoint. 

One of the most impressive 
aspects of the ' movie is the actual 
"rock lessons" that Black teaches 
his class . With subjects that 
included "rock style," "rock histo-

REVIEW 

ry" and "music appreciation," 
Black's character does more than 
just teach the kids how to put 
together a rock band, but also how 
to stick it to the man . 

As far as supporting characters 
are concerned, Mike White is per-
fection as the quiet pushover 
roommate, Ned Schneebly, who 
had quit music to be a substitute 
teacher. And Sarah Silverman is so 
good at being a bitchy, controlling 
girlfriend that you will want to 
slap her. 

The children were, without a 
doubt, the biggest asset to the 
film . Joan Cusack's comedic talent 
may have been wasted as the 
uptight Principal Mullins but the 
adorable naivete, snappy com-
ments - not to mention the 
incredible musical talent - were 
used perfectly. They may have 

been young, but the children dis-
played a natural ability to take in 
the information that Finn taught 
them and use it as their own in a 
way that real lcids do. When the 
shy pianist Lawrence (Robert 
Tsai) goes up to Finn and says that 
he can't be in the band because 
he's not cool enough, the audience 
has no choice but to utter a unan-
imous, "Awww." 

Not only were the lcids talented 
actOrs, their musical skill made the

would be looking at another

of the United States during World 
War n and who e heroic deeds

'vVhile some film s have subtitles, 
1113ny films are made by Asian 
Ameri can s who speak perfec t 
English. ther films are made by 
non - sians. but about s i3ns. 
. ome films are not even aboll t 
Asian Amencans. 

There are al 0 many interna-
tional films from l a iwan, Iiong 
Kong, Cambodia and India that 
range from kung fu to comedy to 
drama. There is a separation of cul -
tures amongst Asians and this 
diversity is hown with the wide 
range of film from different ethnic 
ASIan groups. 

.. ur hope is that eventually 
people of different Asian, Pacific 
Islander ethnic groups will cross 
over to other programs that may 
not be specific to their ethnic 
group," said festival founder Lee 
Ann Kim. 

Kim wants the Asian-American 
community to have a str nger 
voice. Several ian clubs of differ-
ent ethnicities at U SO have pro-
moted the festival. 

" UT goal is to help the commu-
nity, the Asian and Pacific Islander 
cOlnmulllty to dlink from • Pan-

Ian sense," Kim . aid. "That I'm

" In thl~ beJuuful clry 01 great 

diversity, [ still see that, in main-
stream media and entertainment, 
tllere is still a lack of representation 
fo r people o f Asian and Pacific 
Islander descent," Kim said . 

Filmmaker Eric I [wang had two 
of his films screened at past festi-
vals: "White Rice" in 2001 and 
"Weight of the oul" in 2002 . 

"Because there i a lack of 
images of Asian availabl e to main-
s tream audiences, the public 
applie the few tereotypes of 

ians to the whole," Hwang said. 
" It is more of a lack of exposure 

" We want people to think 
of Asian Americans in a 
way that is rumexotic I

"In the guise of comedy nd not 
dark clements, I find It ea ier to get 
my point! acr ss," IlwJng aid. "It is 
much easier for people to get what 
you are aying when you are not 
bemg the tea her. Their defenses are 

down, and you can build ideologies 
and have political effects and till be 
enterrairung. " 

Hwang who grew up in the 
outh and is o f Asian de em, says 

that many of the films hown in the 
festiva l will most likely not be shown 
an ywhere else. l'vlany of the films 
fearured are not big international 
release, but they are small -budget 
films or local films. This include 
many short film . wh.ich are grouped 
in terms of theme. They make up a 
sub tantial part of the festival. 

Kim agrees that there is a wide 
variety of different film genres and 
formats and tates that thi has 
been due to the rise of film submis-
sion . 

"There has certainly been an 
increase in demand from artists. 
Each year we get more and more 
film entrie ," l(jm said. 

In the fir t year, the festival 
received more than 80 film entries, 
but this year there were over 300 
entries. ew this year i a section 
devoted to local films, called the an 
Diego Filmmaker Showcase. 

Yet Marquez feels there is much 
more to be done. 

"There are not enough writers.

Teens: Pedophiles in heaven 
with images of teen vixens 

conrinued from page 10 
plaster risque photos of teen actors 
Frankie Muniz or Haley Joel 
Osment within the pages of Rolling 
Stone magazine. To clarify, I am 
not making a request of such pho-
tos, merely observing. 

What's more, is that The 
Industry - an all inclusive, general-
izing phrase to represent everyone 
who is involved in marketing such 
budding stars - is making these 
female underage sexpots seem like 
legitimate sensual icons. Another 
case in point: The 17 -year-old Olsen 
twins gracing the cover of Rolling 
Stone with shirt 
buttons suggestively 
undone. 

" 

selfish point: Humans years younger 
than me that are packaged to look 
years older pad bank accounts - and 
manage to attract hordes of older 
generations to their sexual image. 
And The Industry capitalizes on it, 
knowing that the taboo of sexualized 
(mostly female) youth will only gar-
ner more sales. 

So, where can we go from here? 
I'm already steeped in neurosis 
about being jobless and unknown 
for the rest of my life, so let's tack-
le that larger, taboo-in-society issue 
still left to be addressed. 

There will not be a time when 

The Industry 
uses such minors as 
veritable sa les 
tools; while some 
starry-eyed con-
sumers are 
bewitched by the 
hypnotic perversi-
ty, no one really 
wants to admit it 
(which explains the 
pass - the-blalllc 
chain mentioned 

That nice Duff girl, 
scyled within an inch of 
her life, is my personal 

demise in a pair of 
factory faded hip-hug-

The Industry does 
not try to capitalize 
on youth and sexu-
ality. There will not 
be a time that con-
sumers are not 
attracted to youth 
and sexuality. The 
two go hand -in-
hand right now, and 
unless a wholly dif-
ferent a pproach is 
taken, they always 
will. ging Seven jeans ... " 

earlier). 
The tale of a cousin and his Duff 

poster would certainly eem to sup-
plement that argument. I'd bet a 
Tiger Beat that he didn't buy the 
album for Duff's vocal talents alone, 
but also for a chance to ogle the 
golden minor in the privacy of his 
own home. 

Perhaps I sound 
like an overprotec-

tive mother hen, but all I am asking 
for is some easier transi tions from 
youth to adult. The virgin to vamp 
path is so gender-specific, degrad-
ing and worn out. 

0, J offer a direct appeal to The 
Industry: Please, save me from an 
early mid-life crisis, and stop pack-
aging 16-year-olds as so darn sexy. 
Please, mix things up a bit, surprise 
your "normal can umers" and 
serve up a mature artist with legiti-
mate talent.

I Spoken 
"The biggest thrill a ballplayer can have is when your son takes after you. That happ~ned when 

my Bobby was In his championship Little League game. He really showed me something. Struck 
out three times. Made an error that lost the game. Parents were thrOWing things at our car and 

swearing at us as we drove off. Gosh. I was proud." - Bob Uecker 

Soccer: Tritons suffer first loss of ea on 
conunu£d {rOOl page :10 

to jUnior Jamie Lautenschleger. 
"KlUni 'S hand is in a ca t and she 

will be ou[ for at least 3 weeks, bU[ 
we're one of the lucky teams to 
have three very strong goaltenders, 
and I don't antiCipate any problems 
at that posiuon," McManus said. 

UCSD survived the rest of the 
first half without any more damage, 
but was unable to net any of their 
eIght shot attempts. 

Th Toro $luted the second 
half off much like the first., scoring 
a goal 53 minutes into play, increas-
ing their lead to three. 

The Tritons finally pulled mem-
selv up by meir cleat uaps and got 
on the board when freshman Kelly 
Cochran scored on a perulty Icicle at 
80: 16, her third goal of the season. 

"We played much better in the 
second half and were able to get a 

couple goals back, but it wa tOO lit-
tle too latc," McManu said. 

In a valiant effon at a comeback, 
junior Jackie haffer converted an 
assist from both scnior Kristin 
Jone and ophomore Lindsey 
Treanlcler into her fir t goal of the 
season in the 86th mmute of the 
game, puttillg UCSD within one. 
Unfortunately, the clock ran out 
for the Tritons before they were 
able to score another goal, puning 
the final score at 3-2, 10ro . 

A1mough U SD managed to 
outshoot the Toros by a 21 to II 
ratio and produce ix corner kicks 
to SU Dominguez Hill's one, the 
Tritons JUSt weren't able to find the 
net. 

MSometimes the shots come off 
clean, and sometime you ju t mis-
Icicle and they don't go in," 
McManus said. 

The loss puts the Tritons' over-
all record at - I and their 

alifornia Colleglatc Athletic 
Association record at 6-1, sti ll well 
at p the CCAA South division. 

UCSD's next game IS at home 
on Friday, ct. when they will 
face AA rival hico State. 
De pite the difficult loss, the 
Tritons are lookmg to continuc the 
high level of play they've had so far 
this year. 

"We aren't going to do any-
thing different (again t hicD 
Statel. We treat every gam the 
same. We just need to get back out 
to kn king the ball around and 
playing our best." McManus said. 

U SO will also quare off 
against rival UC Davis at home on 

Ct. 5. T he Aggies re currently in 
second place in the CCAA North 
divsion with a record of 3 1. Play 

THURSDAY. OCTOBER 2.2003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Men's soccer: Two Taros ejected in game 
continued from page '0 

not much time ran off the e10cle 
before UCSD tallied its first goal. 
In fact, just 1: 17 into the contest, 
junior forward Tiago Venturi, me 
team's leading goal scorer in 2002, 
recorded his first goal of the season 
when he took a pass from midfield-
er Brett Maurer co ricochet a shot 
off the left post into the goal. 
Maurer, only a freshman, notched 
his fourth assist of the year. 

However, the Toros struck back 
just five minutes later. After the 
Tritons failed to clear a CSU 
Dominguez Hills corner kick OU[ 
toward midfield, sophomore for-
ward Francisco Corona banged one 
past UCSD senior goalkeeper 
Jeremy Cooleson and into the right 
side of the net to tie the game. 

Corona then put CSU 
Dominguez Hills ahead on his 
ninth goal of the season. He scored 
with 6:35 left in the first half on a 
booming long-range shot from 
outside the penalty box that beat a 
diving Cookson. 

The first half ended with the 
Toros up 2-1 and having many 
scoring opportunities while keep-
ing the ball on the UCSD side of 
the field for the majority of the first 
45 minutes. CSU Dominguez Hills 
took eight corner kicles, but the 
Tritons challenged every ball to 
keep the Toros from running away 
with me game. 

Both teams played physically, 
slide-taclcJing often, but referee Les 
Young blew his whistle on just 
about every aggressive play, calling 
18 total fouls in the first half; the 
trend of physical and rough play 
would continue in the second half. 

In the 71st minute, a Toro 
defender committed a foul on 
UCSD sophomore forward Grant 
Nishio. On the ensuing free kick by 
sophomore midfielder Matthew 
Davey, the ball was deflected by 

CSU Dominguez Hills goalkeeper 
Javier Barragan, and Triton sopho-
more forward Jon Krupanslcy put 
the rebound at me back of the net 
to tie the game 2-2. 

UCSD took the lead at 73 :39. 
with the help of a couple of players 
whose jobs usually only focus on 
protecting a lead. Junior defender 
Luxe Russell scored his fourth goal 
of the year, connecting with a cor-
ner kick by sophomore defender 
Robert Stetina. The goal gave the 
Tritons a 3-2 advantage, brought 
the UCSD fans to their feet, and 
made the Toros realize for the first 
time this season that they might 
lose a game. 

In their 10 previous matches, 
the Toros have recorded six 
shutouts and have trailed in only 
one game. CSU Dominguez Hills 
was losing 2-0 against Cal Poly 
Pomona on Sept. 22 at halftime, 
but scored three second-half goals 
to pullout a victory. The 3-2 deficit 
it suffered at Triton Soccer 
Stadium was the first real threat the 
Toros had faced all season. 

After me UCSD goal, the Toros' 
play intensified and kept pressure on 
the Triton defense, which allowed 
four CSU Dominguez Hills comer 
kicks in the final 14 minutes. CSU 
Dominguez Hills continued to 
malee hard taclcles, but mey often 
resulted in a foul and a Triton free 
lcick. 

With 9:50 remaining in the 
game, the play stopped after CSU 
Dominguez Hills head coach Joe 
Flanagan got into an argument 
wim Young on the sideline about 
questionable calls. 

The discussion was just a pre-
cursor to me Toro meltdown in the 
game's final minute. Wim just 47

down, Amaya was lcicJced in the 
baCk of the head by Toro midfield-
er Kevin Sosa. Sosa was given a yel-
low card, CSU Dominguez Hills' 
fourth of the half and sixth of me 
game. It was changed into a red 
card after he got into a heated 
argument with the referee. 

Play was stopped for several min-
utes as many Toro players surround-
ed Young, arguing with him. 
Barngan came out of his goal to 
argue with the official, and had to be 
restrained by several of his ream-
mares. He received a red card and 
was ejected from the game. 

After play resumed and the 
Tritons held on for the victory, the 
UCSD players celebrated 30 yards 
away from where a swarm of Toros 
had gathered around the referee, 
expressing their dismay with the 
officiating. 

"When you have so many wins, 
it's tough to accept a loss. They 
would rather die," Armstrong said 
of the Toros' incessant arguing 
after falling behind. "When you 
haven't lost in so long, you thinle 
you're invincible." 

Armstrong, who felt his team 
had not been playing up to its 
potential thus far this season, was 
especially pleased after the game. 

"Our boys played one heck of a 
game," Armstrong said. "When we 
play together like we did tonight, 
we can beat anyone." 

The Tritons will continue their 
home schedule with games against 
Chico State on Oct. 3 at 4:30 p.m. 
and UC Davis on Oct. 5 at 7 p.m. 
Coming off the win over the No. 2-
rated ream in the nation, Armstrong 
does not want the Tritons, who now 
lead the CCAA South, to get over-
confident and overlook any of their 
upcoming opponents. 

"This was just a win," 
Armstrong said. "We have to go 
out and get the next one."

Golf season tees 
off, takes second 

Tritons finish ahead of four 
nationally-ranked teams 
Iy CYNTHIA CHAVEZ 

Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's golf team 
started its season on a good note, 
placing second in its first tourna-
ment and defeating four teams 
previously unbeaten by the 
Tritons, including teams ranked 
third, fifth, 11 m, and 17th. 

"The fact that we beat all four 
bodes very well for the rest of the 
season," said Triton head coach 
MilceWydra. 

The team flew to 
Bellingham, Wash., to compete 
at the 32nd annual Western 
Washington Invitational Men's 
Golf Tournament on Sept. 29 
and Sept. 30. The Tritons had a 
tall order to fill , facing 12 teams 
- five of which were ranked in 
the top Z 5 in the nation by the 
Division II Precept Coaches 
Poll. 

Entering the third round, the 
Tritons were tied for sixth place, 
but shot a tournament best 12-
under par 276 to end up narrow-
ly missing first place, finishing at 
861 behind the University of 
Victoria's score of 860. 

Fifth-ranlced CSU Stanislaus 
finished behind the Tritons with 
a score of 863 , and 11th-ranked 
Chico State took founh at 864. 
Rounding out the top five was St. 
Martin~ College with a score of 
865. 

The Tritons' top finisher was 
senior Alan Scheer, who shot 
back-to-back rounds of 67 on 

Sept. 29 and Sept. 30. T his 
brought him to a tie for third 
with CSU Stanislaus' Ryan 
Thornberry at an eight-under par 
208. 

"Our No. 1 man Alan Scheer 
played in the U.S. Amateur, so he 
was tournament ready,· Wydra 
said. 

The Tritons' No. 2 golfer, 
junior Joe Dolby, scored a 65 on 
Sept. 30 - seven under par, just 
one shot short of the tourna-
ment record. His performance 
placed him seventh overall. 

Also contributing to the 
Tritons ' second place finish 
were senior Brian Duckworth 
and junior Eugene Itlcin, both 
scoring 221 and placing nnd 
overall . Sophomore Robbie 
Kramer shot a 231, which was 
good enough to give him a 48m 
place finish . 

UCSD's golf team nearly 
made it to nationals last year, fin-
ishing fifth in California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
and later tying Grand Canyon 
University for sixth at the West 
Regionals. 

Wydra and the team look for-
ward to surpassing last years suc-
cess. 

"We expect to go to the 
national championship this year," 
Wydra said. 

Their next tournament will 
be the Chico State Invitational 
in Chico, CA, on Oct. 13 and 
Oct. 14. 



Irs tough to 
get back into 
the mix after 

summer 

Pum's 
Points 

Anu Kumar 
Week one of the fall quarter is 

almost over, and I'm finding it dif-
ficult to change my frame of mind 
from a "let' -hit-the-beach" mode 
to a "let 's-hit-the-books" mode . 
Granted it' only been a couple 
days into the quarter and I haven't 
even bought all my books to hit, 
but it's still tough to make myself 
go to school after a long oCal 
summer. 

Switching from a routine of 
waking up in the afternoon, going 
to the beach and then barbecuing 
in the still well-lit evening to a 
schedule of getting out of bed 
before noon, going to class, and 
then thinking about going to 
Geisel or CUCS is tough. It's kind 
of like coming off the bench to 
pinch-hit in the seventh inning of a 
baseball game - you still know 
how to swing the bat, but it's hard 
to catch up to the 92 mph fastball. 

It's not toQ easy, but now that 
the Triton fall season teams have 
reached the middle of their regular 
season chedules, the Padres and 
Dodger missed the playoffs and 
were out of contention months ago 
(L.A. was only three games back, 
but you can't make it to October by 
scoring two runs a game) and the 
Del Mar race track has completed 
its season, I figured that I might as 
well prepare for the school year. 
And to help me switch from the 
summer mode and to remind 
myself that it's not O .K.. anymore 
to JUSt wake up, enjoy the sun and 
go back to sleep, I put together a 
list of goals to help me focus my 
attenoon. Here are a few of them: 

Continue to help UCSD ee

ier if people would Alp to page 18 
of the Guardlfln and take a look at 
the core board that shows the 
women 's volleyball, men '; water 
polo, women's soccer, and the cross 
country teams are all nationally 
ranked. 

Keep my elf from watching 
the going-to-be-Kobe-Iess 
Lakers. That doesn't mean that 
I'm going to call myself a Kmg fan 
or start watching the Warrior, but 
1 think I finally realiz.ed that the 
NBA IS an association of America's 
mo t talented criminals.

only does every new crop of 
Tritons have a hiStory of being 
slightly more attractive than the 
previous crop, they also have meal 
points. I know the food at the din-
Ing hall isn't anything to get excit-
ed about, but It always tastes better 
when you don't have to take money 
out of your own wallet to get it . 

Although this IS just part of my 
list, I soli may have left off a couple 
of reminders. People always wnte 
down "Don't miss class" or "Try not 
to procrasonate" On one of these 
lists, but I don't think I'll forget that 
thel are both bad; that's like going 
up to the plate as a pinch-hitter and 
forgetting your bat.
