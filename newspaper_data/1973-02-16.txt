'Ray Bradbury, Paul Saltman Speak Out Against Hallucinogens 
HAnnAh Cohen 

Dr. Paul Saltman, in his talk last Tuesday on his 
experience with LSD, stated "that we live in a world 
where people seek simplistic answers to complicated 
problems." He explained that to escape these 
problems, people often take mind-expanding drugs 
such as LSD. 

As for his own experience with LSD he says it is 
something he did once but now knowing more about 
the after-effects he said he would not only not do it 
again but he now regrets trying it for the first time. 

Ten years ago in 1963 Dr. Saltman, currently Vice-
Chancellor of Academic Affairs at UCSD, took 100 
micrograms of LSD under controlled conditions. He 
took the drug about 8:30 in the morning and film clips 
were made of his reactions and feelings under LSD's 
influence during the course of that day. 

In the portion of the film shown to a large crowd of 
students in the Revelle cafeteria, Dr. Saltman was seen 
having a very giddy reaction to LSD. He kept laughing 
and his speech was' somewhat garbled . When 
questioned about his feelings while under the in-
fluence he said he had "the feeling of being con-
nected with reality." 

When Dr. Saltman's reactions to pictures were tested 
he seemed to be overly sensitive to shape, size and 
color. He reacted to a portrait of a girl by saying he 
could see the girl as an infant. 

After the film clip was over Dr. Saltman recalled that 
his hallucinations continued that night and on to the 
day after he took the LSD and that he found the second 
day a very strange experience. He said not everyone 
(because. of genetic differences) reacts to LSD in the 

Volume 18, Number 12

author Ray Bradbury warned students Tuesday

same hallucinatory fashion as he did. Other possible 
reactions could include a 'Nirvana syndrome', where 
the clarity of the world becom s clear to the user, or a 
depression could overtake the user where he becomes 
acutely paranoid. 
. Dr. Saltman cited Sid Cohen's study done at the VA 
hospital as conclusive evidence that there is no correla-
tion between the use of LSD and increase in creativity. 
In fact Dr. Saltman said that the creativity of members 
of the scientific community who used LSD for a 
prolonged period of time decreased because their 
intellectual capacity decreased. 

Concerning the after effects of LSD Dr. Saltman cited 
studies which prove that both LSD and amphetamines 
do cause permanent damage to the central nervous 
system. However, so far a complete understanding of 
the mechanisms of the reaction between LSD and the 
human body are not completely understood . Dr. 
Saltman also cited the study done in America over a 
per iod of about two years which showed that mari-
juana is addictive. Addiction was indicated because 
stopping the use of the drug by a heavy user caused 
withdrawal symptoms typical of any addictive drug. 

Saltman feels that the penalties for the use and 
possession of drugs are too heavy but he is "very upset 
about the dealing of drugs." He feels that penalties are 
not the ultimate answer to curbing drug use. 

Appearing with Dr. Saltman was Ray Bradbury, the 
renowned science fiction writer of Martian Chronicles, 
1IIustrated Man and Fahrenheit 451. . 

Back in 1955-1956 Mr. Bradbury was offered the 
chance to take both LSD and mescaline under con-

Student or College Failure? 
Carrie Rickey 

"The people that Third College was 
founded for according to the lumumba -
Fapata Demands, are flunking out, "says 
will Wright, Sociology professor. 

Out of a fall enrollment of 611 students, 
109 students left UCSD's Third College by 
the winter Ejuarter, and of the remaining 
502 students, 92 are on academic proba-
tion or subject to dismissal. 

According to Rowena Reno, Academic 
Counselor at Third College, the majority 
of the 109 students who left the college 
transferred to other UC campusses or left 
because of the lack of financial aids. 

Of the 92 students who are on academic 
probation or subject to dismissal (fai lure 
to maintain a 1.5 average or better makes 
a student subject for dismissal, failure to 
maintain a 2.0 average makes a student 
subject for academic probat ion), all but 13 
are Special Action Admission students. 

(Special Action Adm ission students are 
those students who do not meet all the 
UC requirements for admission but are 
considered potentially good University 
candidates .) 

Third College was initially founded to 
" permit students otherwi e barred by 
unequal opportunities and conomic ex-
igency to be participants in a fir t-rate 
educational experience." 

There hav b n objections from many 
faculty members who claim that Th ird 
College is not meeting its original com-
mitment to " involve large numbers" of 
minority stud nt , but instead, due to 
administrative pr sure, ay Biology lec-
turer Brian O'Brien, "wh r form rl y 
Third College wa interest d in recruiting 
students who had I arning pot ntial, they 
are now competing with tanford and 
Berkeley for minority tudent who would 
come to college anyway." , 

Th apparent hih in Third College' 
recrultm nt thrust has left many tud nts 
who came to Third Coli g exp ting 
enrichment p~ograms, and program that 

would en..abJe them to compete 
academically with the average middle-
class UC undergraduate, in the lurch . 

It is the students who came to Third 
College with the expectations of a place, 
which, as the 1971-72 UCSD catalogue 
describes, "emphaSIses the education of 
minority students and the study and 
alleviation of co ntemporary social 
problems." 

Many at Third College hold that the 109 
student departures and 92 students on 
probation and subject for dismissal are 
the results of what Professor Wright calls 
thc "rhetorical " interest in minority 
programs. 

" Third College is billed as a colleg 
interested in minority students, intere ted 
in students who had been victimized by 
racist institutions, billed as a place that's 
su pposed to enable them to overcome 
this victimization- but on attendance they 
realize it's just the same a the e other 
institutions and it has no specific interest 
in educationally underprivileged 
minorities except rh torically," ays 
Wright. 

To r ctify the present academic cri i at 
Third College, Wright sugge ts that the 
college, "n d a committment to mall 
clas es and inten ive t aching. The 
students n d small groups in which to 
learn. tud nt mu t know that their idea 
are being Ii tened 10 ;;t th tim , not just 
at the end of th qua ' t r." 

" We mu t r alii. and the Third

Mich¥1 Hamburger Arrives 
English poet and translator 

Michael Hamburg.~r has flown from 
~ondon this week to take up his 
post as Regents Lecturer in the 
UCSD Department of Literature. 
The first of his several public talks 
and readings will take place today at 
3 P.M . in the Revelle Formal 
Lounge. 

Hamburger is now unquestionably 
the best known and most admired 
living translator of German poets. 

Recently, Hamburger's own book 
of poems, Travelling, won the 
Levinson Award. And, like Chair-
man of Literature at UCSD, Andrew 
Wright, he has been elected Fellow 
of the Royal Society of Literature. 
For a number of years Hamburger 
was a teacher of German Literature 
at the University of Reading, outside 
London, but in 1964 he resigned to 
become a free-lance writer and 
translator. Since that time he has 
held many distinguished guest lec-
tureships in Europe and the United 
States. 

America, and United States. His 
concerns are so varied, within the 
field of literature and modern 
culture, that 'his visit will be of 
interest to all undergraduate and 
graduate students of literature-and 
many others. 

Michael Hamburger will be at 
UCSD for two weeks. His public 
lectures is as follows: 

2116 - Seminar, "Modes and 
Assumptions of East & West German 
Poetry" Revelle Formal Lounge 3 
p.m. 

2121 - Poetry Reading, Revelle 
Informal Lounge 4 p.m. 

Hamburger fled Nazi Germany 
when young, and published in 
England his first book of poems 
when he was 19. This book was a 
selection of translations from the 
German Romantic Holderlin, and 
began an extended project which 
Hilmburger completed only a few 
years ago, the translation into 
English of the complete collected 
poems and fragments of Holderlin . 

As a result of this work, together 
with many other translations from 
Enzensberger and Grass and more 
recently from East German poets, 

Several books of criticism, notably 
his recent study of The Truth of 
Poetry, show Hamburger extending 
his concerns beyond German 
literature to modern poetry and 
culture in Central Europe, Latin 

2122 - Publ ic Reading from his

Job Opp,ortunities 
This Tuesday and Wednesday, Pacific Telephone 

Company will have a representative on campus to talk 
with students who are one year away from their final 
degree - either the Baccalaureate or Master's - about 
summer management training positions. 

They are particularly interested in identifying women 
and people from other minority groups who are 
considering careers in management. 

For an interview appointment, please come to 
Career-Education Planning Services, sixth floor , 
Building 20, Muir College, where literature describing 
Pacific Telephone's management training program is 
available. 

On Thursday, February 22, the Teacher Corps will be 
back on campus to describe their internship program 
to students who are interested in theching disadvan-
taged children. The Teacher Corps would like to reach 
more minority students, particularly native Americans, 
who are considering careers in teaching. They will be in 
the Revelle Commons Formal Lounge. Anyone in-
terested may just drop in to talk and pick up their 
literature; no appointment is necessary. 

Gay Center Sponsors 
"Sunday, 

Bloody Sunday" 
The Unicorn Cinema and The Gay Center for Social 

Services will present the film "Sunday, Bloody Sunday" 
on Wednesday, February 21 . There will be two 
showings - at 7 and 9:30 p.m. Admission is 52.50 with 
proceeds going to The Gay Center for Social Services. 

About the Film 
Murray Head plays a young sculptor involved with 

Glenda Jackson as his mistress - and with Peter Finch 
as his male lover. The locale is modern England. Much 
of the emotional interaction is set against the backdrop 
of an aware and tolerant family. The film has been 
highly praised as a slice-of-life study, with sensitive and 
true-to-Iife performances. Tickets are on sale at Urey 
Hall. 

The Gay Center 
A natural expansion of the present Gay information 

Center, The Gay Center for Social Services represents a 
wide cross-section of concerned gay persons. Since late 
last summer this group has been putting together the 
framework of an organ ization to be dedicated to 
providing help of all kinds to male and female 
homosexuals. Estimates put the number of gay people 
in San Diego at between forty and sixty thousand. Some 
say this is conservative. The organization is ready. Now 
money is needed. It is hoped to open the Center in the 
early spring, but the date depends on the success of 
fund raising efforts .

White Roots 
of Peace 

An ancient Iroquois tradition tells of the White Roots 
of Peace, a symbol of the first United Nations the world 
ever knew. At the base of the Tree of Great Peace were 
four white roots going out to the four winds in order 
that all peoples could find their way to peace in the 
shade of the Great Tree. 

The Iroquois people have always considered an 
aggressive "pursuit of peace among men" to be their 
mission. In September, 1969, following the Traditional 
Indian Unity Convention, a group of young Mohawks 
set out to renew their commitment to these traditions. 
They adopted the name "White Roots of Peace." 

The White Roots of Peace, a North American Indian 
communications group, has travelled over 200,000 
miles in the United States and Canada to provide a 
meaningful experience through their traditional 
messages, dances, songs, and films. The group has 
visited over 150 colleges and universities, church 
groups, high schools, prisons, and Indian groups. They 
will present a day of programming here Tuesday, 
February 20. 

For Indians, their message is one of hope and 
encouragement for the traditionalists through the 
establishment of revitalized Indian strength and unity. 

For thousands of non-Indians,' the members of White 
Roots of Peace have provided an opportunity for all 
people to hear the Indians' view of peace and 
relationships with their environment as well as bringing 
real brotherhood to all peoples. 

The White Roots of Peace also publishes a monthly 
newspaper "Akwesasne Notes" which has a growing 
circulation of over 23,000 for its 48-pa.ge tabloid. 

The group has worked with Indian film-makers and 
the. National Film Board of Canada and is very active in 
community affairs at their home on the Mohawk 
Reserve at Akwesasne (St . Regis) on the St. Lawrence 
River.

What is the rhythm, the ever so genlle 
way of living, that exists between 
freedom and personal responsibility? 

I experienced high school when John 
Kennedy was killed. I had a concept of 
the violence of the act. I never un-
derstood why some destroyed the vir-
tues he voiced while others said time 
would never change their truth . In the 
years that followed I slowly paid my 
senior year its just tributes. I kept one 
finger pointed at politics at the same 
time just to keep up on the nice-to-
know information . Slowly the cold war 
gave relief to its frustrations. The Tonkin 
Gulf experienced the manifestation of 
two kids violating each other's sandbox . 
As it splashed onto the Lorain Journal , I 
saw the word WAR I Just like the 
headlines I saw in history books about 
1941-45. Great fun I I felt a very strange 
brew that mixed the feelings of what it 
must be like to be the hero of World 
War II; the silent dedication I felt when I 
played my version of war in the ditches 
with neighborhood foes and plastic 
army men; and the fear of going to war 
myself. I was seventeen and didn't know 
how to respond constructively to all the 
feeling I was bombarded with. A quirk 
of history and a disastrous family fuckup 
landed me right in the middle of 
America's elegant institution of the US 
Navy. I was seventeen and didn't un-
de rstand the path my finger was 
fo llowing. So I figured I would play 
st udent and look at The Whole 
stereoscopically. What was war and how 
did I react to it? First, I experiemnted 
with the philosophy of "McHale's 
Navy." It worked well in foreign ports 
and other free time. People were people 
wi th the usual array of posi tives and 
negatives. I explored the phenomen a of 
being at sea, living with 500 people in a 
floati ng city. It was a trip. Five hundred 
civ ilized animals trying to handle five-
and-a-half million idiosyncrasies. We 
were animalsl We knew it because we 
experience d it, togeth er. But you 
couldn't say anything because it was 
"against regulations." So we tried to 
survive each other's nature. On the ship 
is when I experienced my version of war 
- 24-hour vigils working on radios con-
stantly being knocked off the line by our 
five- inch gun shooting into the night. 
That's how I saw it. Some asshole was 
fi lling the darkness with noise and 
maki ng me stay up to fix co m -
~u nications gear that kept the admiral . 
In touch with the " war." I went home on 
leave to break the jaunt overseas. While 
home, I felt the words WAR again exact -
ly as I did after high school. This time it 
was written across Jimmy Whitmore's 
face. I was nineteen and didn ' t unders-
tand. No one ever died in the ditches. If 
you didn't like the way the war was 
going, you flipped somebody off and 
took your men home. I saw Jim but 
didn't know who to flip off. I couldn't 
because I still was keeping another 
finger on another phenomena - the 
peace freaks. I liked what they were 
doing. Personally, I related well to their 
freedom mainly because I was without 
mine. Still I would usually watch them in 
awe knowing they represented my peo-
ple who went on to college Instead of 
th military. They found they cou ld 
stand up and say what they felt hoping 
Someone would listen. 1967 came along 

and I got out of one institution I never 
truly understood. I ~aS' twenty-one and 
began to realize the impact the next few 
years could have upon my life. The USA 
had stuck her nose into the wrong set of 
boxing gloves this time. For this fight the 
world was watching, not fighting along 
side. The Vietnam War lingered, 
seemingly on purpose, and the world 
just watched to see what Uncle Sam was 
gonna do. I came to UCSD Spring 
Quarter, 1968, to experience a freedom 
unsurpassed in time. Most of us were 
young, riding far back in the tube of the 
waves of a lull . A lull of a storm that has 
brought America to her knees, stripped 
her naked. Civil war, however subtle, 
seemed so very close. I lived in Ocean 
Beach and commuted to school. Basic 
mode of travel : hitchhiking. Most fre-
quent obstacle : SDPD hassles. For those 
who knew OB, police conjured contem-
porary distortions of Gestapo. It was 
having a friendly local neighborhood 
policeman breathing down your neck if 
you were young and had long hair. The 
intensity switched from calling him " The 
Man" early in the year to callinlS him 
" Pig" by the beginning of summer. 

1968 befouled my soul and befuddled 
my mind watching the trial of the 
Chicago Eight manifest everything I 
thought for those I had ever been in 
contact with that had any control of 
power for people. I lived in a police state 
and yet went to an institution that 
strongly professed freedom . On my 
journeys home in the evening I would 
ponder the conflicts of truth and beauty 
of OB and UCSD. The police one place, 
peace another. During the fall and 
winter quarters that followed, I moved 
closer to the dorms until I was finally 
there. The people with me at Matthews 
grew up together. We started in an 
environment that was virgin. The college 
was still a baby, the ideas had not yet felt 
the impact of inherent responsibili ty, 
and . the staff! studen ts! faculty! ad-
ministration seemed damn near one 
entity. This was our wave. Our ride was 
the never, never land of philosophy that 
existed between the cold war and the 
Vietnam War. Values became two-faced, 
virtues double-edged, and freedom was 
a reality. We lived and loved together. 
And ca red for what happened about 
each other. Going to classes, writing 
papers, doing head trips on certai n dis-
ciplines, going to work, and getling units 
seemed only a sideline. The true and the 
clear wa s the life-style we learned. To 
quote a friend , it was "ni ce and easy, 
slow and sleazy." Not tbo much pressure 
and just enough responsibility . 

Alas, time marched on leaving in-
cidents like Columbia, Ocean Beach, the 
San Deigo Street Journal, People's Park, 
the Cambodian Invasion, and Kent State 
to mi)( with wonders like Woodstock to 
leave signposts of our ride. Kent State, 
1969. The road forked here. For those 
caught in the tube, the ride was over. 
Anything we felt happy over, anything 
we felt strongly for, anything that we 
had life for died with the four people. 

Any dream that I had for seeing my 
country together was only a tailwind on 
those bullets now. Hopes died. But I 
couldn't give up something that gave me 
birth, permitted me childhood, and 
offered me freedom . I thought perhaps 
hanging on a few more minutes, years, 
whatever. might do omething. 

I fell in love with a girl, watched her 
grow into a woman . After Kent, she 
became my life line for survival in this 
country. She saw good in th ings that 
were no very indifferent to me. I 
looked hard at those things she had as 
virtues and va lues of her own . I tried to 
understand " where she was coming 
from." I only stood naked as a 
bewildered child damned scared of my 
country. She often experienced my 
frustration but cou ldn't understand it. 

With her, things were still. I knew my 
strength and accepted the care of this 
woman. My imagination was true and 
resourceful. I remained quiet near her, 
awaiting the mud to settle within my 
opaque pools. I looked to know con-
stancy. I tried to look beyond the confu-
sion and complexity of the many con-
fli cts that built within me. I wanted to 
know the unchanging way of nature I 
had known in th e fields of my 
childhood. 

The Moose knew love and I knew the 
dimensions of the wave we both learned 
to ride. I was beginning to feel the 
impact of our interaction. I found I 
didn't have to look beyond her eyes for 
my happiness. Perhaps we could make a 
marriage that interlaced her tenderness, 
a way to ride, and the paranoia given of 
OB. But spring quarter was closing and 
she was off to Germany. She would 
change and so would I. 

The summer of 1971 was a well-
financed psychedelic circus that saw the 
La Jolla Cove as the big top (with a dash 

of Muir Orientation for flavor) . America 
walked by our private plot behind the 
shuffle board courts. Every kind of per-
son from every breed of me. Them 
walking or us sitting in the grass : I 
wondered who the audience? who the 
clowns? I pondered this in many forms 
over the whole of the summer. 

Us in. the grass. Could we be the 
clowns? The skies were clear . Cares lost 
themselves in history. Smog was an in-
termittent reality. The surf was consis-
tent. The Cove was our sandbox . And 
our country was at war and we didn 't 
give a shit. Us in the grass? YEPI We were 
the clowns. 

The turning point came in August . The 
signpost: the La Jolla Program. I sat 
through three weeks of the most intense 
encounter modern western man has 
developed to illustrate his institutions of 
progressive huma n istic psychology 
adaptive to the pace of his society. 
When I emerged that 7th day of 
September, I was mindphuqued, bam-
boozled, and quite confused. I had 
gotten a look at some of the other 
clowns. In a strange way their judgment 
and humor was often brutal. Those peo-
ple had so many trips going at the same 
time it was almost unreal! But there was 
something beyond. I guessed to say I 
saw many quirks of behavior flashed on 
my memory as ghosts of first hand ex-
periences in the military. And I often 
wondered about the people in the

Vietnam: People's Victory 
The Indochina Peace Campaign 

We are extremely happy at the signing 
of the Agreement on Ending the War 
and Restoring the Peace in Vietnam in 
Paris on Jan. 27, 1973. A few days before 
the signing of the Agreement, Le Duc 
Tho, chief negotiator for the Democratic 
Republic of Vietnam, offered warm 
thanks to all the friends all over the 
world, especially in the U.S. for the 
efforts which made this victory possible. 

It is indeed a victory for the Viet-
namese people. In principle, it is the 
peace based on independence and 
freedom that the Vietnamese have been 

~ig!lting for for so long. It recognizes the 
. Independence, sovereignty, territorial 

integrity, and unity of the Vietnamese 
nation which has been fought for with 
so much courage, patience, and deter-
mination. It marks the end of a decade 
of U.S. military intervention and the 
beginning of political struggle in South 
Vietnam. It is the diploma.tlc aspect of 
the three-part offens ive (military, 
political, and diplomatic) begun by the 
Vietnamese in March last year . It is 
based on the strength of the resistance 
forces in South Vietnam. 

We view the Agreement as a positive 
step forward, but we approach it with 
caution khowing that the United States 
has not forsaken its pla ns to dominate 
and cont col this region of the world . The 
massive shipment of war materials and 
"civi lian" advisors to Vietnam prior to 
the signing of the Agreement provide 
some ind ication of continued U.S. in-
volvement. North Vietnam and the Pro-
visional Revolutionary Government of 
South Vietnam have indicated they in-
tend to scrupulousl y abide by the terms 
of the Agreement which they authored 
and proposed. In contrast, the Thieu 
administration has already violated the 
terms of the Agreement. For e)(ample, 

Thieu is demanding that elections not be 
held until North Vietnamese troops 
leave the South, a concession sought by 
Kissinger before the signing, but 
definitely not gained. In violation of the 
provisions 10r the release of political 
prisoners. Thieu has begun relocating 
political prisoners, reclassifying them as 
"criminals" and using other tactics to 
prevent their release. 

Our role as Americans is to be in-
formed and to inform others about the 
violations of the Thieu regime and 
further attempts by the U.S. government 
to carry out its neo-colonial policies in 
South Vietnam. We need to create a 
climate of opinion in opposition to 
further U.S. aid to Thieu and to continue 
to express our solidarity with the Viet-
namese through such programs as 
Medical Aid to Indochina. 

In San Diego the Indochina Peace 
Campaign is staffing and maintaining an 
Indochina Resource Center with radio 
tapes, a slide show, an art exhibit, access 
to films and speakers. Our office is open 
and we welcome visitors and calls from 7 
to 10 p.m. Monday through Friday. We 
are also d istributing the Indochina 
Bulletin (formerly the War Bulletin, it is a 
bi-monthly paper with current news and 
analysis about Indochina), through sub-
scriptions and street distribution. 
Included you will find the current issue 
and we urge you to sign up for a 
subscription or to help distribute the 
paper to your workplace , 
neighborhood, school, or organ ization. 

The tasks ahead are still many, but we 
have achieved a great deal through our 
efforts to this point. Your help is 
needed. If you have only a small amount 
of time or money to contribute, let us 
know and we will help you find the best 
way to use it.

Students In 
Support Of 
Dr. Linck 

Because the Chemistry 
Department has obviously 
chosen to ignore the ex-
istence of its own students 
by failing to recognize the 
worth of its best teacher, I 
propose students take the 
following action as a means 
of protest: students plan-
ning to tak'e chemistry 
courses next quarter who 
are concerned over the 
outrageous decision of the 
Chemistry Department not 
to give Dr. Linck tenure 
should not register for 
those courses this quarter. 
(Students should wait until 
the last day of the second 
week of spring quarter to 
add these courses.) The 
University of California will 
not support a Department 
which has no students . 
Hopefully in the meantime 
the Chemistry Department 
will either reverse its deci-
sion or extend the deadline 
for reaching a final deci-
sion. I also suggest that we 
try to raise the money to 
rehire Dr. Linck ourselves. 
Students have successfully 
raised enough money to 
rehire professors at UC 
Berkeley in the past.

Rebuttal to 
Kristine 
Michel's 
Review 

. 

Editor: 

new movement, a 
definition? What would 
constitute an alternitive to 
it? 

d. Ms. Michel's lumping 
together of Joe Cox, Wade 
Sanders, Darrell Westlake, 
and Michael Kelly is ob-
vious groping to finish up 
the' article, The only thing 
that these four artists have 
in common is that their 
work appeared in the same 
room. Moreover, Michael 
Kelly was judged by her to 
be the most "versatile." Is 
that because he had two 

. pieces of work in the show 
as opposed to one piece 
each in the case of the 
others? How can one's ver-
satility be judged on the 
basis of one piece? 

e . Al though the ~how 
lacked excitement for Ms. 
Michel, we must put that 
down to her inexperience 
and inability to deal with 
the work, since her article 
gave us no grounds for 
considering her 
knowledgeable enough to 
even understand its fun-
damental postulate and 
concerns . The show 
generated considerable ex-
citement and enthusiasm 
in the art community, both 
on and off campus, 

We would hope that Ms. 
Michel's article is not in-
dicative of the quality 'of 
work of the TRITON TIMES 
staff but fear that it 
probably is. It is reasonable 
to expect a newspaper to 
have journalist 's 
knowledgeable in the areas 
they cover . Certainly in the 
field of art criticism the 
TRITON TIMES has failed 
mor e often than 
succeeded in its obligation. 

We would be interested 
in seeing Kr istine Michel 's 
work in a few years.

Constructive 
Criticism In 
Support Of 
Third College 
Editor: 

acknowledge the possible 
lack of back-ground . It 
would seem reasonable to 
me to do away with the 
concept of failure and to 
only measure the extent of 
success. The educational 
system I would prescribe 
would be similar to that 
used by Dr. Ebbesen in his 
social psychology class, The 
student starts at the begin-
ning and builds his 
knowledge unit by unit, 
not advancing until he is 
proficient in the previous 
unit. The competition is 
within the student; he is 
graded on a standard of 
what every first semester 
student should know in his 
field of study. In this way 
the student can devote the 
necessary time to building 
I,is background and at the 
same t ime progress 
towards the "quality" 
education afforded a 
University student. The stu-
dent who has the 
background already is not 
held up, but the han -
dicapped student gains the 
same information in a 
slightly longer time. 

I do not profess to know 
all the problems of Third 
College. I merely hoped to 
offer a constructive 
thought to ease the 
frustrations of Marsha and 
D.l. 

Sincerely, 
Eric Julien 

Revelle Senior 
P.S. Maybe the University 
shou Id consider viable 
mass educational programs 
aimed at the specifi c need 
of the individual- it might 
benefit us al l. 

Thanks For 
Counseling 
Stories 
Editor: I want to thank 
you r corr es pondent , 
Charles Heimler, for the 
very fine article published 
in the TRITO TIMES edi-
tion of Friday, February 2, 
1973, on Counseling and 

. Psychological Services. Mr. 

up, the "cosmetic 
agreement" will wear off 
and the communist 
"plague" will again start 
bricking up the tunnel 
where the light has already 
"flickered out". 

Some say the pen is 
mightier than the sword. If 
this is the case, then Olson 
is swinging his sword 
around to impress the 
common people, like 
a blundering knight afraid 
of his own shadow, he 
should be in the middle of 
battle, fighting the Com-
munistic hordes. 

Olson is crying out that 
Communism must be 
stopped, and I can think of 
no better way to do my 
part than by sending him 
into battle. But after 
reading some of his trash, I 
wonder if this is a wise 
thing to do . The poor 
fellow might go insane, call 
everyone a barbaric Com-
munist, and start shooting 
our own men. I also 
wonder if he has the in-
teligence to hold and shoot 
a gun. But he does have 
promise as the ultimate 
weapon (besides fissioning 
him, though it's tempting). 
He could swing his mighty 
sword and write the leaflets 
the Air Force litters 
(nothing better to do with 
trash) over the country 
side. I have no doubts that 
the unfortunate Com-
muni $ts would laugh 
themselves to death 
holding one of Olson's 
bullets. 

So do your sacred duty 
and contr ibute toward the 
$560 needed to by a ONE-
WAY airfare to S.E. Asia. 
That is only '10 cents per 
person in UCSD. Send your 
contribution s t o the 
TRITON TIMES and in -
dicate that it is for the 
Kevin Olson Travel Fund. I 
don 't know about you, but 
to me, 10 cents is a real 
bargin if it rids the land of 
this BLIGHT.

Ha vi ng read Kri st ine 
Michel's criticism of the 
recent show of scul pture in 
th e UCS D Art G a ll ery 
(2/ 9/ 72), we had mixed 
thoughts about the value 
of a rebuttal. After all , si nce 
Ms. Miche l is clearly naive 
about art and art conce pts, 
as the art icle made quite 
apparent, it was ha rd for us 
to take her article seriously. 
It was decided, however, 
that because the UCSD 
commun ity might take it 
seriously a rebutta l was in 
order. • 

The following points of 
rebu tt al are presented in 
the order of the article's 
original points. 

a. Brian Connell is not 
interested in giving the il-
lusion th at gravity does not 
exist . The existe nce o f 
gravi ty is one of the most 
im porta nt bases of hi s 
work. Gravi ty is used to 
provide a tension that sup-
ports the work in some 
piecE!!i; a physical tension is 
exerted in order to defy 
gravi ty in other pieces. 

I read wit h great interest 
the art icle by Marsha l ynn 
Shelton and D.J. Scales and 
the following editor's com-
ment which appeared in 
the Feb. 9 issue of the 
TRI TON T IM ES . Bo t h 
represented good points of 
view but neithe r present ed 
a solution . May I do so 
now, at least in view of the 
arti c le , " Is Thi r d 

Heimler described our ac-
ti v ities a nd se rvi c es 
available to studen ts very 
we ll ind eed . I would , 
however, like to clarify one 
point. Students will find 
co unselors at each of the 
three co lleges in add ition 
to the ce ntral location in 
H& SS. Th e Coll ege 
Counselors loca ted at the 
Reve lle Provost's Office, at 
2122 eD adjacent to the 
Muir Provost 's Office, and 
at 701 Matthews Campus in 
th e Third College Resident 
De an' s area are all 
members of Counseling 
and Psychological Services 
staff. Students may meet 
with the se c oun se lors 
directly either by appoint -
ment or by walk ing in; they 
do not have to make these 
arrangements through the 
central H&SS location.

And isn't it cheating the

Griffin' s pr o po s ition 
(L tiers, T.T. 2/6/ 73)and I 
too, offer my full support 
to help send Mr. Olson to 
S.E. w re, and, like all mak 

I wonder if the people 
th at d ied crossi ng th e

liberty and nslavement 
are controversial as Mr. 
Griffin does. The barbed 
wire, land mines and watch 
dogs have a tremendouw 
effe c t on a man, it 
degrades mankind to the 
point he will die to escape 
it. Liberty has the opposite 
on mankind , living with it 
as we do, some take it for 
granted . The only reply to 
that is you· never realize 
how good you had it until 
it' s gone, if the is any ques-
tion, I am sure the Czechs 
could tell him how it feels. 
Because Steve obviously 
has so little respect for the 
libe rty our forefathers died 
to give him , this is not for 
him . In the words of l 
George Savile, 1912, ' liber-
ty can neith r be got nor l

that mank ind are generaly 
unwilling to give the price 
for it ." You know, dear

merely for writing his

wardens of dawn? Do I hang myself from 
a barren cross and scream " listen to Me, 
people - I AM DYING FOR YOUR 
SINS?" Do I make Christ my wagon-
m.aster and take a ride through history 
With trappers, traders, pilgrims, prospec-
tors, draft dodgers, men of the wild 
mountains, with gentle families, rugged 
workers, cowboys, soldiers, murderers, 
preachers of the wild voice? Is He my 
leviathan that fought the Indians, killed 
the buffalo, and planted the cities' that 
stirred up trouble , kept slaves, freed 
slaves and was a slave himself' that 
fought in a blue uniform and fought in a 
gr ey uniform ; that bandaged th e 
wounded and made war a way of 'Iife? 
Do I give up my secret that here on the 
Western Edge the Beast turned, con-
fused, enraged? I felt like screaming . I 
could only answer her with my eyes: 
" Who are you looking for? He is not 
here ... " 

I sc~ea~ed with my people. In my 
short lifetime, I saw America lose faith in 
her own greatness, I went out and found 
o~t for mysel!. I died August 21 , 1972, in 
Gila Be~d, ArIZona , giving up my naivete 
for my Innocence. For I had realized the 
libat ion of my people and found its 
purity laced with untruth . Never before 
and never again would my finger follow 
what it has. 

America today and say the simple 
~ords : It's over with, it's all over. There 
IS no r:'eed to set the timetable; it ;s in 
the air. The course is mapped in 
bedrock. Even the world stands blind at 
the threshold of its own consummation. 
The storm rises amidst fervent scarlet 

. sunset warnings. 

My dea~h is o~ the spirit. And finally 
the battling directions meet , and 
suddenly are no more. And the sho~1 ;s 
over, really over. But only the show not 
the day of Judgment. ' 

My finger now holds the reins that 
~~st guide my steed . Wrapped in a 
VISion of Satari Rising, raw bolts from this 
hand and Christ in my eyes, I shall pour 
out my lust to be free. Do I go out into 
America, into the wounded landscape 
the insulted wilderness? Out where I a~ 
handed two choices : Let us accom-
modate you or you die . 

Me and the Undertaker, into the land 
of Opportunity? 

, Pe~~aps not so dramatiC, but still so. 
I m tlnng of jumping up and down like 
the little kid anymore. One way or 
another, for this reason or that I stand at 
a. bizarre crossroad in hlstor)': I have to 
find a rhythm betwee'n the child in me 
and the. animal I am. I have got to know 
some ,kind of Truth that is constant. I 

hav~n t found it here. 
Look to the forgotten among you, if 

you want more gambling time in this 
arena.

"Martha Rosier's Monumenta'l 
Gar(b )age Sale" Revisited 

..-.~--r.,.----I 

Milrthil Rosier 

Whilt, Is II Artl 
The definition of art was not handed 

down for all time by God. The question 
"But is it art?", whether asked bluntly or by 
implication, inarticulately or prettily, always 
has the same meaning. This question was 
the heart of Sandy Dijkstra's n article, "A 
Note on Garage Sales." The question 
presupposes a fixed distinction between 
that which is art and that which is real. It 
reminds me of the distinction sometimes 
heard between "unnatural acts" and their 
presumable opposites, natural acts. The 
latter seem to be those that have been 
certified as acceptable - usually by some 
higher power. I accept neither this v.iew of 
nature nor this view of art. If something 
happens in the world, then it is natural, 
though not automatically desirable. 
Similarly, there can be no flat distinction 
between art and reality. Art is reality, an 
ongoing activity of artists and the material 
manifestation and reification of that activi-
ty; art is in and of this world, not an 
attempted re-creation of a Platonic ideal 
Form or of a half-remembered 
Wordsworth ian pre-existence in heaven. 

I see art as an agreement, tacit or stated, 
between at least one individual (the 
"viewer") and one life experience. The 
agreement consists in the individual's 
willingness to consider the experience as 
falling within the domain "art." Most often 
the experiences so considered are not 
lethal or crippling, especially if they are the 
result of the activities of another individual 
(designated "the artist"). But that does not 
mean that they have no force at all or that 
they should have none. It is not particularly 
helpful to argue about whether something 
is art; the question is whether the thing is, 
by one's own standards, good art: a ques-
tion not of ontology but of quality. And the 
definition of "good II can vary a lot. I gather 
that Sandy Dijkstra was unhappy with my 
Garage Sale. Evidently she doesn't enjoy 
going to garage sales, and mine was no 
exception. A pity. 

But the issue of its artness merits some 
discussion, for clarification, at least. To Ms. 
Dijkstra, art must be enobling - she quotes 
Marcuse's fiat that art should "seize things 
and free them from their bondage in an 
ugly and destructive reality" and she adds 
that lithe aesthetic dimension ought to 
offer a potential for a new and better 
reality." First, taking this position to its 
conclusion, if the quality of life ("reality") 
were to cease being ugly and destructive, a 
good utopian hope, then art would no 
longer be with us because it would no 
longer have a function or a raison d'etre; 
an orthodox Freudian idea, which I reject. 
My second objection, arising from an im-
mediate rather than a millennia I point of 
view, seems more compelling: Dijkstra's 
(and Marcuse's?l view of art casts art in the 
role of a beautiful but useless lady, who 
must remain above this dir~y world and 
furnish us with inspiration. The Southern 
belle theory of art. My reply is let art come 
down off its pedestal I Art can and shall play 
a better role. It has in the past, and it will 
again find a more potent and functional 
integration into th life of our culture than 
is made possible by prettification (or 
uglification, for that matter) and isolationin 
museums or other mausoleums. I have 
fought the pedestal fight as a woman and 
now I find I must fight it as a maker of art . 

Art or life! 
If art seems close to life, so much the 

better. Art is life, a part of life. Reality is not 

art, life is not art (unless you decide to see 
them that way), but art is life, art is reality. I 
see art as a kind of privileged communica-
tion, capable of ' carrying any of many 
different kinds of messages or meanings, 
simple and complex. Emotion, physical 
qualities, natural processes, some specific 
illumination or realization about the world, 
are some of the things that can be com-
municated by art. Most art provokes a 
.mu.ltileveled response in the range of 

~esponses of which people are capable. Art 
is not a zoo animal, caged and defanged, 
on display to tickle the sensibilities of a 
public who fancy themselves in danger 
from its bite but who very well know they 
are not. Artists should not settle for con-
tainment in the box of beauty and inspira-
tion . Let there be no culture commissar 
who wishes to preserve the pathological 
alienation of a primary human function -
art making - from the rest of life. Music 
had to again become part of life before it 
was anything more than a connoisseur's 
game, and so must art. 

But in order for art to do anything the 
viewer must keep up her or his end of the 
deal. You cannot describe Rembrandt's 
"Night Watch II if you don't open the door, 
turn on the light, and look at it. Further-
more, in looking at it you must also allow 
yourself to see it. If I hadn't been there 
when Sandy Dijkst ra breezed through my 
Garage Sale I would have doubted that she 
had ever come to look at it. As it is, I am 
sure she did not take the time to see it. 
Surely her mind was made up about its 
"va lue" as "art" in the first three minutes. 
Do you read a book by flipping its pages? 
There were more subjects in my Garage 
Sale than pages in War and Peace, I hate the 
idea of "explaining" my work . I am not an 
essayist, and there is always more than can 
be got at by any verbal description - an art 
work is, after alt a unitary entity and as such 
has an organic integrity of form. Also, I 
work with ambiguity, which suffers under 
sheer description. But I'll touch on some of 
the things I was concerned with in doing 
"Martha Rosier's Monumental Gar(b)age 
Sale." 

The Garage Sale as Cultural Entity 
First let me point out that most garage 

sa les are not, as charged, "conglomerations 
of useless objects (useless because ama~sed 
togetherl" but rather embody the idea that 
although the things in them are "used", 
they are still potentially of value - and of 
use - to someone else. Thus, Ms. Dijkstra's 
dubbing of the garage sale as the 
apotheosis of Obsolescence is incorrect. 
With this point falls her consequent point 
that "nowadays these things (what 
things?) are considered useless because 
they are old; we have been taught to 
treasure only the shiny, unused virgin ob-
jects." This point of view speaks volumes 
about class identification; the view 
happens to be one I don't share. Horrid 
accusations may be leveled at garage sales, 
but that is not validly one of them, I think. 
Garage sales are about the hope of 
retrieving some value from a castoff. They 
are the replacements for charity donation 
in a culture in which material plenitude has 
finally reached the "lower classes." 

And should we indeed lament the 
passing of the era of the great "world fairs", 
when objects per se were capable of ex-
citing awe and titillating the spectators? In 
Martha Rosier's Garage Sale, at any rate, 
objects were data in the evocation not only 
of an environment, a cultural con-
sciousness, but of an individual psyche as 
well.

The Viewers and the 
" Artist'. Responsibility" 

What, for me, separated the work from 
an audience-participation piece was that 
there was no audience. There were, in-
deed, groups and individuals - collective-
ly, a crowd - some of whom knew they 
were involved in a piece but many of whom 
did not. I was quite comfortable with this 
and let pass many chances to point out the 
"art" aspect of the Garage Sale. I provided 
numerous clues - and after all, the work 
was in an " art gallery" - but did not want 
to push it. I was interested in controlling 
movements through a real and 
metaphorically charged space and 
provoking certain trains of thought and 
behavioral patterns - not necessarily those 
of the art world but those of the 
marketplace, an ages-old hub of human 
interaction. On the micro level, people had 
to be seduced into investigating and 
manipulating the hundreds of little items in 
the environment. They had to fight their 
own "buy reflex ", maybe, to enjoy the 
voyeuristic one of being involved in the 
remains of someone else's past or to trigger 
the "art response reflex." 

. The inte.ractive aspect of the Garage Sale 
d~d, as I said, seem to work best on opening 
nrght. The sense of uncomfortableness in a 
somehow alien environment that I was 
aiming at operated perhaps too well at 
other times, when the people in the gallery 
were too few to be a crowd. It was in a 
crowd that people had the courage to 
move through and contact the environ-
ment and mine it for content. (Le Bon, 
Rud and other students of crowd behavior 
must surely have made this point over and 

ov~~. ) But I think I was not prepared for the 
~blltty many people displayed to simply 
Ignore the heaps of trash, the painted-
stage-set ga~age entrance, the Playboy 
foldouts pOised over a droning tape 
recorder, the empty cartons, and other 
clues to meaning. The artist-horse can lead 
a fellow horse to water but can't make it 
drink. The artist's responsibility is to in-
troduce the other horses to the water and 
let them take it from there. Art need not, as 
Ma~cuse would ~~ve it, " name the things 
which are absent. Let viewers name names 
themselves. Coercion and force feeding 
have never been my approach. 

It is one thing to assert that art must'hold 
out a possibility of something different 
from what is, that it must transcend a simple 
reading, imply a heightened content. But 
the me~ns by which such a broad goal may 
be achieved cannot be restricted to the 
point of driving art out of real life into a 
twilit never-never land, to achieve its 
effects by means of a ghostly echo floating 
over the water. A transcendence of the 
mundane, if one is needed , can be 
achieved by as simple a device as framing 
- removing something (like a garage sale) 
from its usual context and placing it in 
another (like an art gallery) and thus dis-
rupting its original function - inverting the 
urinal, as it were. But my piece had a lot 
more separating it from " naive" garage 
sales thansimply its frame, as I have tried to 
make clear. 

Art For SOlie? 
Isn't art in galleries usually for sale? 

Running concurrently with my show was Ed 
Ruschas book exhibit and sale.On the same 
page as Ms. Dijkstra's article in the n was 
an article entitled "Graphic Exhibit" that 
stated II All works to be displayed are 
available for purchase" (translation : All the 
prints ar for sale). And should artists be so 
hors de combat that they may make money 
only through a third party or perhaps be 
independently wealthy? To me a more 
interesting question to ask is why nobody 
visiting the Rusch,a show asked how much 
the potted plant costs, whereas at mine 
many people did, though I doubt people 
expect to buy plants at a "real" garage sale. 
Now that more and more of art has swung 
away from /labstract" (nonrepresen-
!ati<;mall art back tow.ard representation, it 
IS Issues of representation and its 
"strategies"that are open and whose boun-
daries are no longer clearly fixed. It is 
unease about representational art style 
that underlies controversies such as the one 
about my Garage Sale. It is when the 
boundaries of art/not art are threatened 
that everything seems up for grabs and 
conservative tendencies are expressed by 
those who worry i1bout boundaries,

White Roots of Peace 
"White Roots of Peace", North American Indian 

communications group mainly from the Mohaw.x 
Reserve at Akwesasne on the St. Lawrence River, is 
scheduled to present a day-long series of events next 
Tuesday. 

The scheduled events will invlude mov;es a main 
meeting wit~ communal dance and chanting, an arts 
and crafts display, and seminars concerning Ind ian 
cultural traditions, religion and prophecy and reserva-
tion life. All are free and open to the p~blic . 

A display of arts, crafts, photography, and music will 
take place from 10 a.m. to 12 noon on Revelle Plaza. At 
12 noon, the movie liThe Blood of the Condor" will be 
shown in room 2100 of the Basic Science Building at the 

Sc~~ol ~f Medicine. liThe Blood of the Condor" paints 
a VIVid picture of the day-to-day life and customs of the 
Quechua Indians of Bolivia. Filmed in the Quechua 
dialect with English subtitles, the GO-minute film depicts 
the. fa~e of the Indians who constitute an overwhelming 
majority (65 per cent) of the Bolivian population. 

The main. meeting and Indian film festival will begin 
at 8 p.m. In the UCSD Gymnasium. It will include 
traditional and contemporary works by Indian film 
makers whic~ pres~nt both past history and present 
causes. The films Will be followed by a presentation of 
communal dance and chanting in which audience 
participation will be encouraged. 

"White R?ots of Peace" was founded in September, 
1969, follOWing the traditional Indian Unity Convention 
by a group of young Mohawks who set out to renew 
their commitment to their traditions. They took their 
name from an ancient Iroquois story which tells of the 
Tree of Great Peace with four white roots going out to 
the four winds in order that all peoples could find their 
way to peace in the shade of the tree, 

Since its founding, members of the group have 
travelled over 200,000 miles in the United Stat 5 and 
Canada to provide a meaningful experien e through 
their traditional messages, dances, songs and films. 
They have visited over 150 colleges and univer itie 
church groups, high schools, prisons, and India~ 
groups. 

The group's visit to the UCSD campu i ponsored 
by the Campus Programming Board.

Crew Calls For Precision 
Why are these men 

smiling? Could it be that 
these men are not wearing 
any gym pants and are 
totally embarrassed? 
Perhaps these men are 
smiling vecausp. the 
photographer is not 
wearing any gym pants. 
Whatever you may think, 
there is no doubt in this 
author's mind that these 
UCSD oarsmen are having 
fun . In fact, CREW has the 
same amount of letters as 
FUN (minus one?) 

Take a look at the grin on 
that front man's face . He 
has good reason to smile as 
do all his team-mates . 
Good fortune does smile 
upon the Tritons this year. 
With the return of last 
year's big eight (Dave 
Lisher, John Winkles, Jack 
Wiant , Dave Turnquist , 
Dave Johnson , Morgan 
Johnson, Jay Bernard and 
Jeff Walton), we are also 

blessed with 18 freshmen· 
and an assortment of 
novice upperclassmen , In 
contrast to last year's 16 
total crew-members, we 
now have no less than 35 
oarsmen, 4 coxswain and 
room fo r many more. Such 
a potential crew team as 
this is enough to make any 
Triton grin from ear-to-ear. 

If this year's crew team 

Grapplers Prepare 

turnout isn't enough to 
raise one's eyebrow, then 
their schedule should. Our 
potential is so great that we 
have challenged, for the 
first time ev.er, the U.S. 
Naval Academy as well as 
U. of Washington, UCLA, 
Stanford, UCI, San Diego 
State, Ventura College and 
the women's rowing club 
ZLAC. 

Competitition this year is 
rough but an anonymous 
coxswain, Bart Sevilla , 
predicts that this year the 
Tritons will make a clean 
sweep on all its com-
petitors. On March 24, the 
UCSD freshmen will be 
laying their undefeated 
win streak on the line at 
Mission Bay. The powerful 
freshmen have not been 
defeated on their home 
waters, Mission Bay, since 
April of '72. But on the 24th 
of March they will attempt 
to push that win streak to 
an unprecedented two in a 
row. 

So what influences a man 
to want to become an 
oarsmen? What is it that 
makes a fellow get into a 
shell (boat) with a hull no 
more than 1/ 32 of an inch 
thick? Why the he ll does 
he do it? Well th is author 
randomly asked different 
oarsmen why they came 

for crew. 
Coxswain Bart Sevilla :"1 

was using the bathroom 
and one of the crew-men 
refused to stop bothering 
me until I agreed to join 
crew." 

Oarsman Mike Glass: "1 
wanted to be a hot- jock" 

Dave Johnson (Cox-
swain) : "1 like the com-
petition." 

Jack Wiant (Oarsman) : 
"Just wanted to do 
something and exercise. I 
found it so interesting that 
it became a compulsion 
with me. Now, I can 't im-
agine why I do it. I often 
wonder myself." 

Dave Turnquist 
(Oarsman) : "My room-
mate wakes me up at 4:45 
a.m. anyway, so I might as 
welL" 

Bill Gebur (Coach) : 
"Think it's exciting. These 
men are an extension of 
my ego, my ability as a 
former oarsman." 

These guys are plain 
fellows, like you and me, 
but these men have 
molded themselves into a 
team. They are a unit, ac-
ting as one, with the ef-
ficiency of a well-oiled 
ma chine. Crew builds 
character and teamwork , 
Togetherness is what builds 
a crew team. All must act as 

Tourney Draws Near 
they didn 't have a little more depth . 

At any rate, these diversions serve to 
derail the reader from the train of 
thought. Coach Pinkerton feels there 
are a couple of his wrestlers that stand to 
do very well at the tournament and 
possibly go to the nationals. The two 
most favored are Jorge Correa - Mr. 
Everything in the wrestling world at 
UCSD, and John Knapp - a large 
brusing wrestler. Mr. Pinkerton also ex- , 
pects the rest of the team, including 
Curtis Tom and John Lege to do well in 
their efforts. 

There are suitable reasons why Jorge 
Correa is referred as Mr. Wonderful in 
the UCSD wrestling world . Perhaps an 
MVP trophy at the All -Cal tournament 
would justify this honor? Or maybe the 
MVP trophy of the rather prestigious 
CalTech tournament? If you're still a 
skeptic - there's more. Jorge has just 
been ranked the third best wrestler in 
the STATE - that 's not school, city or 
county, but STATE, in his weight class of 
118 pounds. This includes wrestlers from 
such prestigious schools as UCLA, USC, 
UC Berkeley and Stanford. There most 
definitely is something to the talk that 
UCSD has one of the best wrestlers in 
the state. 

After February 24, all will be over for 
the season leaving only the usual "if"s 
and "could be"s for next year's team. It 
just "could be" that the entire team is 
coming back next year (including John 
Knapp, Jorge and Javier Correa, Curtis 
Tom - the Cal Tech hero, and John 
Lege, a freshman, and "if" some good 
freshmen come out then UCSO could 
have one of its best teams ever. 

one for with a hull only 
1/32 of an inch thick, one 
untimed stroke could im-
balance a shell and crack it 
in two. These men are 
together. Any morning one 
can come down to Santa 
Clara Point and see thsse 
men gliding down glassy 
waters in rhythmic har-
mony. Their motion can be 
described only as a bird in 
flight. With oars clicking 
like the snap of a finger, 
these men and their shells 
are a sight to behold. 

Because of the variety in 
rowing categories, crew is a 
sport for all. Essentially 
there are two groups, four 
and eight man shells; and 
these two groups are sub-
divided . There are 
lightweight fours and 
eights, heavyweight fours 
and eights, freshmen eight 
and four, novice eight and 
four, and practica ll y any 
other classification you can 
think of. For the m.ore ex-
perienced, egotistic per-
sons, there is the one man 
shell called the skull. 

In addition to the four 
and eight men rowing, 
there is also a rather 
lightweight fellow who 
steers. This fine, outstan-
ding fellow is th e coxswain 
pronounced "cox'n." Con-
trary to the popular belief 
that all this fellow does is 
yell " stroke" he is actually 
the coordinator of the 
men . A few of his duties 
are: to keep the men in

Tritons 
To Face 
USI 'U 

The time is rapidly ap-
proaching rabid fans, 
when you will no longer 
havfr the chance to see 
the 1973 Triton Basketball 
team in action. They have 
three more home games 
remaining and two of 
them will be played this 
weekend. 

Friday night sees the 
good guys take the court 
against cross town rival 
USIU, who Just recently 
defeated the Tritons in a 
bruising contest . The 
Junior Vasity contest will 
start at 6 p.m. with the 
main event (the varisty 
match up) following at 8 
p.m. 

Saturday, same time 
and place, the Tritons 
face the Cal Lutheran 
Varsity and Junior Varsity 
contingents. UCSO's 
current record now 
stands at 10 wins and 11 
losses, so this weekend 
means a lot to the team 
who would like to regain 
a record. 

. UakllOWll Stars 

Women Smash USIU 
When the typical UCSD 

student thinks of basketball 
on c .. mpus (if he ever 
thinks about it at all), he 
usually thinks about either 
the school's intercollegiate 
team, featuring the stars as 
Glidin' Gie Simpson and 
Tall Paul Trainer, or his 
own intramural team, in 
most cases, the latter. Rare-
ly does one even consider 
the "other" basketball 
team around town. This 
one features such greats as 
"Sweet" Aliena Salmon, 
Hilary "the Bomber" Chit-
tick, Judy " Tower of 
Power" Lower, and Diana 
"Boom-Boom': Barba. The 
"other" team is unknown 
despite boasting such feats 
as finishing first in their 
league last year, bringing 
home a 14-4 record on last 
season, and winning the 
Cal Western tournament. 
,., Why has the tea m 
remained in the dark for so 
long?" you ask. This is a 
worthy question, lacking 
an answer at this moment, 
as the intercollegiate 
women's basketball team 
looks forward to another 

8 '~~;_\ I ~. , , 

superlative season. 
This year's team is 

looking forward to quite a 
successful season - and 
who wouldn't with four 
starters returning from last 
year's fine quintet? The 
cream -of the returning 
crop includes "Tower of 
Power" Lower - UCSD's 
version of the big man in 
the middle - only in this 
case it's woman in the mid-
dle. Judy was last year's 
captain and all around 
marvelous player. She has 
led the team in rebounding 
and is a consistent scorer. 
You can still call the junior 
"captain" as she retains the 
title this year also. 

That's not all the Tritons 

have to offer up front. 
Aliena Salmon and Diana 
help form one of the best 
front lines in the area, 
comparable only to the 
Conquistadors. if even 
their front line compares. 
Sweet Salmon is one of 
those sophomore all-
around players starting at a 
forward spot and doubling 
as center whenever Tower 
of Power needs a rest. She 
is a fine rebounder and 

,another consistent score, 
one of the five on the 
team. Boom-Boom Barba is 
the "new" starter. She's a 
freshman playing the other 
forward spot opposite 
Aliena. 

The guard positions are 
filled quite to the brim with 
a large array of talent. Last 
year's starters Hilary Chit-
tick and Cindie Tashima 
are back and ably assisted 
by Sharon Wood and Kathy 
Spatafore. 

Hilary Chittick was last 
year's "offense es-
tablisher". This means she 
runs the offense quite well 
and features good ball 
handling technique and 
excellent form in her out-
standing shooting to go 
along with a fine floor 
percentage. Cindie 
Tashima was last year's 
other starting guard and 
complements Hilary well in 
her ability to establish the 
tempo of the game. Sharon 
Wood is a freshman guard 
who plays well and started 
in the recent USIU game. 
Kathy Spatafore is UCSD's 
anser to Keith Erickson in 
other words, a swing 
woman. She can play both 
the pOSitions of forward 
and guard with equal abili-
ty and flair. 

This year's team is 
blessed with a vast amount 
of depth - quite a contrast 
to the usual UCSD athletic 
team endeavor. This year 
there were 24 girls who 
tried out for the team 
enabling Coach Carter the 
luxury of picking a talented 
group . Th is year he is 
carryi ng 17 players on the 
team compared to last 
year's season high turnout 
of 10. 

The outstanding qualities 
of this year 's team are 
balanced effort and good 

Skiers Frolic 
The Recreational assistants in conjunction with the ' 

UCSD Ski Club are again sponsoring a one day ski trip 
to Snow Valley Wednes~ay, February 21 . The fantastic 
ti me had by the 47 that went on the lasf trip was an 
indication of how one can take advantage of this great 
offer. Lift tickets will cost $3.50, lessons will be either $3 
or $4 and full rentals $2 or $3, depending on whether or 
not you use wood or epoxy skis. The cost of transporta-
tion will be $1 .65 per person. Sign-ups for the trip will 
be limited to the first 46 people that come to the P.E. 
Department Tuesday, February 20 at 9:00 a.m. First 
come, first serve, The bus to the slopes will leave at 5 
a.m. sharp. 

For those of you who live in the dorms, check with 
the personnel in charge to have a lunch prepared for 
next day's activities.

team play. These qualities 
were very evident in 
UCSD's first game, a 55-39 
victory over US IU and a 
hopeful prediction of more 
good things to come. Being 
the first game of the 
season, Coach Carter was 
quite pleasantly surprised 
to see the girls blending so 
well on the court. There 
was a balanced team effort 
in both rebounding and 
scoring enabling the 
Tritons to roll to victory. 
Coach Carter was able to 
play the entire team as the 
Triton girls broke to an 
early twenty point margin 
and led by a sizable 
amount during most of the 
game. 

This Friday the girls will 
face their first major op-
ponents of the season. The 
team will journey up to UC 
Riverside to engage in that 
yearly frolic, the All-Cal 
Tournament. The girls are 
seeded fourth and come 
up against such competi-
tion as UCLA and UC 
Davis. These schools are 
already well into their 
seasons and thus have a lot 
more playing time together 
putting the Triton girls at a 
disadvantage. It will be in-
teresting to check the out-
come of this tournment, as 
it will show the true poten-
tial of the team. 

After All-Cal will be the

AFTER TEN MONTHS OF RESEARCH 

We pieced together a system we could 
recommend under $200. The ROTEL 150A 
receiver with its 2 yr. parts and labor warranty 
was found to deliver more power & better FM 
reception than all competition. Using Z- 203 
(8 inch 2 way) speakers we weren't able to 
find anything that even came close to their 
smooth, natural sound. Finally the Garrard 
40B automatic turntable using the GRADO 
FeR cartridge gave us what we believe to be 
the best sounding combination.

are okay to buy used - opened jars of 
food? Used shoes? How personal does an 
item have to be for it to be a social sin to get 
it already used? (5) Can the act of putting 
something up for second-hand sale alone 
make it seem undesirable, or are there 
other grounds for judging its worth? (6) Are 
things left over from our own pasts merely

Bradbury, Saltllan ... 
Continued from pilge 1 

trolled conditions but he refused because he 
"respected his subconscious." 

Mr. Bradbury feels that he has been high all his life 
on writing and you could get high "by doing the thing 
you love to do and turning inward to your own 
creativity." This he feels will "help you to survive the 
neKt month, day and year." 

Mr. Bradbury fell in love with science fiction when 
he was twelve and has also been a subscriber to MAD 
magazine for seventeen years . He educated himself 
througli the library. He says that he knows he is crazy 
and the important thing is that he admits it . He feels 
that his endeavor to become excellent has pumped 
him and he doesn't need what drugs could offer him. 

Mr. Bradbury's cure for boredom is "the living at the 
top of your emotions and the rationalization of them 
by your intellect." The best way to do that he feels is by 
going to a library and choosing any book blind folded 
and seeing whether you are in love with the subject it 
holds. Indeed, Mr. Bradbury feels that when young 
people start asking "who am I, what do I want to do, 
what do I want in terms of myself" then drugs will no 
longer be necessary. People will then be able to 
function with their own madness and that will make 
them sane because they will find "their own love with 
creativity."

good spirits, observe t~at 
his crew-men are rowing 
with proper form and call 
out verbal commands to 
correct, inform his men of 
fie ld position, and most im -
portant, steer a straight 
course. There is oftentime 
question as to who is ac-
tua lly in command of the 
shell. Oarsmen are usually 
6'2" while the COlIS wain 
averages a mere 5'2". But 
in an actual race, it is the 
coxswain who takes total 
command. The oarsmen 
usually agree to this for if a 
race is lost, all the blame 
goes to the coxswain. 

Every sport has its few 
people who stand out 
more than others. The one 
or two men who, let us say, 
carry the ball for the team. 
But in crew, every man 

Slosh-Slosh carries the ball. There Isn 't 
one man who is not as 
important as another. All 
are equally as important. 
No one or two men can 
row a shell to victory. It 
takes everybody to give 
their all, with equal power. 

Ruggers Dro'wn Pomona 
Johnno Staight 

So who are some of 
these fantastic crew men? 
Well, they come in all 
shapes and sizes. Some of 
the freshmen include: 
Craig Uchida (super 
lightweight at 100 Ibs.), 
Craig Simmons, Mike Glass 
(former all time basketball 
great), and Rick Christian. 
Also, let us not forget the 
upperclassmen and 
women; Beth Elis (prettiest 
coxswain at the University) 
Morgan Johnson (sup'er 
heavyweight with pudgy 
tummy), Dave Johnson 
(oldest coxswain and 
number 12 in the draft) and 
Jack Wiant (a beast).

The UCSD Rugby team played its first 
league game of the year last Saturday, 
easily defeating the Pomona Jerks, 20-0. 
But it was a day of long stories, which 
need not be relived or recounted. After 
traveling 120 miles, with two full teams, 
the UCSD ruggers found themselves 
faced with a muddy hole of an athletic 
field , a cold and rainy day, and a 
Pomona squad that could barely fill one 
15-man team. Though both sides played 
sloppy rugby, UCSD dominated the 
game with sheer skill and experience. 

The Pomona Jerks had their problems 
in that they only had three real rugby 
players, the rest of the team being com-
prised of frustrated football jocks wh? 
did not seem to understand that rugby IS 
not T.V. wrestling. Under difficult cir-

IN THE WHOLE PLACE, , 

ANYTHING. EXCEPT

AND OUR EMPLOYEES_ ! 

cumstances, UCSD played a fine, fairly 
mellow game. One-punch Lance did his 
best to keep the Jerks in line, but they 
continued to play a cheap-shot game. 
Dickie Ostrup played his usual great 
game at scrum-half. 

In the muddy field , the ball was quite 
sli ppery and the scrum was hard to 
control, but Dick handled his job more 
than adequately. Don Riordan got fired 
up by the Jerk 's rough play, and scored 
twice for the Tritons, while John 
Ringwood and Ric Jones chalked up a 
try a piece. Jones also converted two 
kicks making the score a lopsided 20-0. 

This coming Saturday, UCSD plays the 
Newport Rugby Club and the UC Irvine 
Rugby Team here on the Tritons home 
field at noon.

Feb . 21 -"Nigeria: One 
Nigeria" documents the 
history of the 1967-70 Civil 
War. The film reveals that the 
reason for Biafran secession 
was really due to the oppor-
tunism of General Ojukwu 
and other leaders linked with 
Western economic interests, 
to control oil in Biafra at the 
expense of the people. 201

"Blood of the Condor", a 
Bolivian film, takes as its star-
ting point the forced steriliza-
tion of Indian women by U.S. 
doctors. The most popular

Blood of the Condor im-
plicates the Peace Corps and 
the La Paz government in an

is a truly significant film in its 
treatment of the conditions of 
Indian peoples in Bolivia.
