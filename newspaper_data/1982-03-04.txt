Response to 
Ms. Broughton 

B y PETER MORTEN EN 
It is rare that The UCSD Guardian responds in its columns to 

articles appearing in other campus newspapers, However, a 
letter to t he collective appearing in last Tuesday's new indicator 
did suffIciently irritate me to offer these words on Robyn 
Broughton's mi demeanor conviction for calling in a false bomb 
threat during a biology exam last quarter and on her charge that 
s he is "a victim" of the Guardiall and the university. 

It is true that Robyn's firs t letter was refused publication, but 
not because it reflected badly on the Guardian as a whole. We're 
used to being taken to the woodshed by other campus 
newspapers, students, faculty and the community. Rather, the 
letter did not run because (as i. now readily apparent) it contain!:> 
a severe and vengeful attack on Nick Hanna, the Guardian news 
writer who covered Robyn's story. Simply put , it is not Guardiall 
policy to run lett ers to the editors t hat defame the character of 
another in an unreasonable manner. 

Nick Hanna is no exception to this rule. Reponsible 
journal ism preclude turning an opinIOn/ editorial page into a 
playground for immature name·ca lling. I will have no staff 
writer, editor. indeed, no person at all labelled a "dick" in our 
editorial space. 

And in this specificca e, everal of Robyn 's references toNlck 
were clearly defamatory and libelous, leaving her open to 
possible legal action initiated by the writer and hi publication. 

Robyn 's second letter - as she stated in her letter to the lIi-
was never received by the Guardian. What more can [ say? We 
can' t print omelhing we don't have. Randy Hill. Guardiall 
opinion /editorial editor, never received a letter from Robvn in his 
box, nor did I. Perhaps, although it is a little late, Robyn should 
consider resubmitting her second letter for publication in the 
Guardial/ . 

And finally, as for Robyn's al legation that she is being 
persecuted by the admimstration for her invoh'ement in last 
June's si t-in at the chancellor' office: guess again. True, there is 
ample evidence to make a case against the university for 
historically haras, ing individuals who do not play by the rules. 
Just a k Jon Bekken, Monty Reed , or the late Charles Patterson. 
But this is not the situation in Robyn's case. UCSD has been 
plagued by false bomb threat problem!> for years, and the last 
three quarters have been particularly bad. 

Bomb threat · are undeniably selfish acts that are very , very 
bad for all concerned. It is no wonder, then, that the UC D police 
and professors were working overtime last quarter to catch 
bomb threaters. They would have been derelict in their duty if 
they had not 

As they were trackillg down Robyn using her tape·recorded 
voice and other relevant indicators, th ey had no idea hat she 
was a student act ivi!>t. 0, it was simply the first time that the 
aut horit ies felt t hey had sufficient e\'ldence against an 
indi"idual to proceed with legal action. 

There is certain ly a lot more that I could say about Robyn's 
case - but this page, as I have said, is not a forum for personal 
attacks. 

As for th~ lieu iI/dim/or'" handltn.g of the 'iituation, I can 'iay 
that I am dlsappomted 10 theIr chOIce to run Robyn's leiter. It 

wa~ unfaIr to Nick Hanna , and it was unfair to the Guardial/. 
Last year, the Guardian ran a number of letters to the editor 

criticizing the lIew indicator. It was a mist ake to do so, and this 
year it has been our po licy to withhold all letters of thi~ nature 
and forward them to the appropriate publication. We th10k this 
IS the ~st [Xllicy in deal10g with the affaIrs of another campus 
publ ica tIOn . We hope the staff of the lieU' mdir'llor wi ll consider 
t.hls poliC\' for the future !>o as to a\'oid pre~ nting potentially

Letter to the Editor 

The UCSD Guardian Thursday. March 4. 1982 

Oliphant 

Glen and Shearer 

Looking for Mr. Goodel u b 
We knew t hat vi 'iling a 

health cluh would be an eye-
opening experience - and 
then :>ome. But we never 
' u pected how much the 
encounter would teach us 
about our elves. 

Though new 'paper ad, er· 
tisemenh acro s t he count ry 
ha ve been telling us to "get 
wit h it" for several vears, we 
decided to take the cure in 

outhern California, where 
"exercise ce nters" have 
become as indigenous to the 
landscape as freeways. 

It was just aft r 5 p.m. 
recently when we joined a 
,,vave of young bu si ness 
people, school teachers and 
"elf-professed actor~ and 
actresses at "The ports 
Connection" in bodv-
con~cious Sa nt a Monic·a . 
Many of our cohorts had paid 
several hundred dollars for 
annual membershIps to enjoy 
acce~s to Uni versa l weight 
machines, racquet ball cou rts 
and a wide array of co' 
educational ' Iimming courses .. 

We quickly rea li zed that a 
smgle visit would on ly scrat ch 
the surface of this club's 
means of gelling in shape. It 
also dawned on us that the 
booming exerci5e busine!->s 
said more about our 
generat ion' s emot ional health 
than abou t its physical well · 
beIng. 

Piped-in rock and roll, aj uice 
bar and plush changing room!> 
helped make this more than 
t he average gym. The 
conditions were perfect, the 
mood relaxed. An hour or two 
here eased one's nerves in 
ways preferable to t hose of a 
scotch on the rocks. 

Whether Oil t he aerobic 
dance fl oor or in the weight 
room, the quest for phy ical 
perfect ion seemed to tran-
scend sex ual lines. With men 
and women both donning 
bright, "l iquid skin " togs, it 

almost appeared tha t T1t' Sexes 
were co mpetin g fM t he 
unofficial honor (If " Best 
Human Specimen ,. 

But there ShOU,l, be no 
mistake. Sexu:lli t\· is the 
active ingredien t In a fitn es~ 
cent er's ability to al tract and 
mix you ng si ng lb . 

One femal p physician's 
remarks spoke for many fellow 
participants: " J don't have 
much time to f( ,)1 around," she 
said. " I came lv'r e to exerci<.;e 
and check e II t he guy '. It ' 
one of the fl'\\' place in town 
where you knl)\\' what you're 
getting. " 

It would he difficult to 
mea ure \ ,.ct her health clu bs 
are mOle effect ive meeting 
ground5 for young people than 
singles bars or dat ing services. 
But the drift toward them may 
indicate that man y Americans 
find uch oases more nat ural, 
fresh and comfortabl y within 
their realm of experience. 
Indeed, health clubs might be 
the logical recourse for a 
generat ion that has enjoyed 
manv social freedoms but 
ha!,j,'t fo und fulfillin g 
~(l l u t ions. 

I t'n the most gregarious 
among us can' t deny that the 
opport unities to meet men and 
women after college often 
eem limited. Co-workers and 

neighbors don ' t always make 
up for the untold numbers of 
interest jng·looking people one 
encounter", but never meet s, 
on the s tr eet. in th e 
supermarket , or on the bus. 

Many of us who went 
through col leg believing it to 
be the perfect training ground 
for post ·graduate life have also 
found that the les!>-se lf· 
conscious social environment 
on campu s isn't eas il y 
duplicated in the rea l world . 

Per haps many of our 
cont emporaries moved too 
qui c k I y fro m f r e ' h man 
orientation to "management 

trainee," missing some of the 
le::;son' along the way. A 
recent art ide in The Neu' York 
Tim es suggest ed an even 
worse situation tod ay, 
reporting concern among 
college deans that this fall' s 
freshman la s ha given an 
unhealthy low priOrIt y to 
socia li zi ng. Unfortunately, 
the e gri nds are likely to find 
themseh'e , as man y of their 
predecessors already have, 
woefully unprepared for 
managing their personal lives 
to atisfaction. 

The decision to join an 
exercise center, then. is almost 
a' if to say, "I' m get ting my act 
toget her." It '<; taking the 
in itIative to spend a portion of 
t he day social izing beh i nd the 
veil of phy Ical fitness. That so 
many young American adults 
are pumping and gnnding may 
indicate that healt h clu bs are 
helping in the search for an 
"organized" way for , ingle 
adults to meet one anot her. 

Perhap!> the average "Sports 
Co nn ection" cli ent has 
discovered that professional 
status and a big salary are 
meaningless when one's self· 
wort h is so mudd led that 
conversat ion WIt h strangers is 
vi rtually impossible. Or, after 
years of hanging out at singles 
bars, many more may ha\'e 
joined their local exerc ise 
st udio knowing that electronic 
bucking bu lls don 't make the 
world go 'round . 

It' s ironic that one's 
emotional well ,being may be 
lhe real focus of physicall y-
oriented health clubs. Yet , we, 
too, left the 'anta Monica spa 
with an expanded sense of 
"healthy." But there 's more to 
getting in shape than toning 
one's muscles. As beneficial as 
regular exercise can be for a 
good di spos ition, no amou nt of 
leg· lifting a lone can cure an 
undernourish d demand for 
com panionship. 

Proposal for trailer park at stables

Letter on financial aid was misanthropic 
Editor: . 

Robert Nagler's letter concerning 
financial aid cuts and how to deal with 
them (UCSD Guardian, Feb. 25) 
requires a response. Mr. Nagler 
sugge ts that students who are going 
to have their aid cut back "get a job" 
and stop complaining, As a working 
student (who is not on financial aid ), I 
find the attitude represented by his 
tatements most objectionable. 

Apart from the fact that his 
estimates of the co t of cducat ion are 
far too low (and his estimateR of 
earnings unreasonable), Mr. Nagler's 
attitude of, " If I can work my way 
through school on my own, anybody 
can - and if they can't, they don 't 
deserve to be here, " is ca llous and 
totally insensitive. H is suggest ion 
that students who dislike the idea of 
working whil at t ending chool 
liquidate assets (" 'ell your car , tereo 
and accompanying record collection, 
stamp collection, etc.") or quit school 

and save money borders on the 
maliciously sarcastic. 

Other pa rt of Mr . Nagler's 
argument are ba ed on false premi es. 
First , he seems to feel that everyone 
on financial aid is a freeloader who is 
leeching the , tate for money not 
needed . I submit that most people on 
financial aid do not fit thi s 
description. In some ca 'es, perhaps. 
But a systematic indictment of all 
recipients of finan cial aid IS unfair. 
Such statements arc used far too often 
to ju tif y disembowelment of 
assistance program . econd, he 
assume that everyone who wants a 
job can find one (and wi ll also be able 
to fit it into a student' s schedule). 
With the economy in its present 
condition, and campus employment in 
short suppl y, this is a convenient 
overs impl ificat ion which allows Mr. 
Nagler to rationlize his distaste for 
finan cial aid recipients. 

Mr. Nagler a lso a erts that 

educatIOn I'> a pnvtledge, Perhaps SC), 
but I would argue t hat limit mg 
education to those who can afford it on 
their own, which is the unavoidable 
result of elimmating financIal aid, is 
discriminatory . We face the danger 
that onlY 'tudents from wealthy 
backgrounds will be able to pursue 
any form of higher educatIon. Wit h 
tuition at private <;chools approaching 
$ 10,000 a year and UC fee ' rismg 
rapidly, this day may not be far off. To 
condemn poorer st udents to a second 
rate education, or no educat Ion at all. 
i criminal. 

[ mu!>t concl ude that ;\1r. Nagler 
feel s contempt for those less fortunate 
than he(i.e., those\\hocannot makeit 
th rough sch(xli wi thou t ~ome form of 
a5si5tancel. He deser\'e~ credIt if he 
can support himself, although hIS 
remark that parents ""hould be able 
to come up with $700" casts senous 
doubt on this point. To expect 
everyone else to do the same, however, 

IS unrea"onable For too many 
students, the realltv I.., that cuts m 
fmanclal aId (and 'Ioans) will fl)rce 
t hem to qUI t ..,chex,1. 

ThIS doesn't ~et'm to bother Mr. 
Nagler at all. In fact. he gves on to 
')tate that, "mce we are a capltahst 
!>oclet v, we "hou Id be prepared to 
lompete. Compete for what;' The 
chance for an educatIOn? Apparently 
he mean.., that if someone cannot 
afford education, then, "too bad" 
ThIS offen..,i\t:lv elttl~t attttude 
mdICate. a compiete lack of concern 
for other:>. 

In short, \1r. Nagler ..,hould dl~play

struggltng to make It through "choo\' 
If he can't. t hen I suggest t hat he 
indeed become, "One of t he few, the

Is Reagan planning for another war? 
Editor: 

Ronald Reagan is asking t he 
American people to swallow the 
largest budget increases for the 
military in US peacetIme history. 
When a ked why, he mutt ers 
something about our "window of 
vulnerability," and the Soviet threat, 
making eve r yo n e else seem 
unpatriotic for even questioning his 
proposal. Republtcans claim, quite 
accurately, that in the past ten years 
defense spending has decreased 
steadily, and that the Russian now 
outnumber us in several key areas. It 
is for these reasons that Mr. Reagan 
adama ntly refu ses to di scuss 

trimming his military spending hikes, 
while cutting everywhere else. 
Considering a defici t of nearly $100 
billion (his e t imate), hadn 't we better 
think twice? 

The first thing Congress needs to do 
when considering Reagan 's proposal 
i. to a k them elve what the purpose 
of defense spending is. Is it our place to 
defend ourselves, or the whole world ? 
Conservative e timates show that 60· 
70 percent of military outlays go, not 
to defending Ameri ca, but to 
defending Europe, Asia, Africa, and , 
ha ha, Latin America. Almost $90 
billion goes to NATO, well over half 
that organization' budget (it is 

laughingly called a "mutual defense" 
pact). Almost $30 billton goes to 
defend1l1g Japan and the repres~i\e 
regime in South Korea Japan, if you 
need reminding, lone of the world\; 
st rongest economies, easily able to 
defend itself. yet only pending one 
percent of its G P on defence (we 
spend six percent). 

"But what about the O\'let threat 
and the window of \ulnerabilitv?" 
Has anyone topped to ask why' all 
tho e Ru sian weapons are pointed at 
us? Could il be because of all the 
weapons that we have POll1ted at 
them? Why aren't there bombs aimed 
at Australia? Could it be that by 

cull ing down on he number of 
weapon'> t hat we ha\ l" we wou ld 
actually be Increastng our security? 
Violence is the result of fear, "0 wh~ 
make our enemlt'. more afraId? And 
\\'h\ are we 0 afraId of a nation that 
can"t even conquer Afghamstan: a 
natIon that, unlike us, ~hare" a \'er:-
long border WIth a large and hostile 
nation (I.e. China)) 

Thetruthl that\\eha\edonemore 
tu help the O\'lets than todeterthem. 
By proppIng up unpopular faSCIst 
dictators In the Third World , we have 
set the ma .. es of the world against us

The fire, which erupted

researchers on the . cene 
established that only small

Fire officials were at first 
reluctant to enter the building 
to ext inguish the blaze, fearing

Analyst 
calls for 
DC cuts 

SACRAMENTO - Gover· 
n or Brown' s efforts to 
maintain a mode t budget cut 
for the University o f 
California next year were 
dealt a setback this week, with 
Legislative Analyst William 
Hamm's recommendation that 
t he university's general fund 
be trimmed $20 million more 
than Brown has suggested . 

In addition, Hamm proposes 
to raise $10 million for fi scal 
1982·83 by in c rea s ing 
education fees for postgrad· 
uate s tudents. UC medical 
s tudents wou ld pay an 
additional $1.667 per year , 
dental students an additional 
$1 ,333 and other graduate 
students an additional $400. 

News Briefs 

EPCadopts 
policy 

A new policy to deal with 
academic dishonesty was 
adopted by the Executive 
and Pol icy Com m i ttee of t he 
Academic Senate at their 
meeting, T u esday. The 
Committee acted after the 
full Senate was unable to 
reach a quorum at their 
meeting last month. 

The policy prescribes 
that, in cases where a 
faculty member accuses a 
student of cheating and the 
s tudent maintain s hi s 
innocence, an ad· ho c 
committee would be 
established to examine the 
evidence and determine the 
st udent' s innocence or 
guilt. 

This ad·hoc committee 
would be appointed by the 
chairman of the department 
of the class under protest. 

The UCSD Guardian 

He would appoint three 
facu lty members and two 
students, "from within or 
without the department." 

St udent represent at ives 
to the Academic Senate had 
oppo ed the policy ince the 
Committee on Educational 
Policy submitted the 
document for final approval 
la t month. Undergrad rep. 
Mike Fizer explained that 
he felt t he composition and 
selection process of t he ad· 
hoc commit tee might create 
a committee prejudiced 
agai nst the tudent, and 
proposed instead that each 
department seat a standing 
committee to deal with such 
case, and that tudent 
representatives be chosen 
by the Judicial Committees 
of each college. 

Faculty member felt, 
however, that the policy 
was fair, and that standing 
committees would tend to 
be less impartial than an ad· 
hoc committee. 

Equipment 
• • mlsslng 

An auditor 's report 
released to t he Los A nge/es 
Times reported that 
bet ween $30,000 and 
$35,000 worth of equipment 
disappeared last year from 
the Physics department 
storeroom. 

The report did not clearly 
blame th disappearance on 
mismanagement or theft. 
But Ralph Lovberg , 
Chairman of the Physics 
Department, told a Times 
reporter t hat "it's a safe 
supposition - when a big 
chunk of inventory goes like 
that - that it's been stolen. 
But who might have done it, 
I can't really say." 

Transitors, integrated 
circuits, wires, cement. 
solid state circuits, 
capacitors, and resIstors 
constituted the bulk of the 
missing equipment. 

Bottle 
bill 
to voters 

BY HENRY CHULMAN 
acramento Corre.pondent 

SACRAMENTO - After SIX 
years of legislati ve failures, 
proponents of a bottle and can 
deposit law in California claim 
they now have enough petitIOn 
sIgnatures to place the 
measure on the November 
ballot . 

Several member s of 
Californians Against Waste 
(CA W) jOined state Senator 
Orner Rains to present the 
Sacramento County clerk with 
more than 27,000 ignatures 
gathered in the county. 

Statewide. the group boasts 
520,000 signatures, more than 
half again the 346.000 valid 
'ignatures requi red to place an 
initiative on the ballot. CAW 
representatives WIll tun: In 
petitions in 19 counties next 
week. 

Hamm also recommends 
reducing the university' s 
capital improvement budget 
proposal, which this year was 
introduced January 7. The 
legislative analysis i used by 
legislators as a guide during 
the budget deliberations, 
which will begin within the 
next few weeks. 

Brown's budget proposed a 
$51 million increase in the 
university's budget which , 
with inflation, would result in 
a 2.5 percent loss of spending 
power. Most s tate agencies are 
asked to take a five percent 
cut. 

Communication proposal 

SImilar laws exist In eight 
state., where a minimum five 
cent deposit IS paId for all 
beverage bottles and cans, 
which, when returned to 
grocer, are re old to 
di tributors for recycling.

clear their desire to see UCSD 
offer broadcast ing courses and 
a greater number of video and 
film classes, one CEP member 
noted that such a move might 
make UCSO's department 
more vocational, like the one at 
San Diego State University. 

But one woman, who works 
at the campus radio station . 

KSDT , quickly insisted that 
communications students are 
not "at UC for vocational 
training. Other UC schools 
offer communication s stu· 
dents some training and the 
history. theory and other 
aspects of communications as 
well. " 

Many of the students 
present indicated they felt 

SDSU's program to be too 
"narrow and practical." and 
that the education they sought 
in communications embraced 
a much wider understanding 
of the media and its social 
impact. 

On March 9. the CEP 
subcommittee will meet again 
in room 201 of the Media 
Center, between 3 and 5 p.m.

Hammgives 
report 

preliminary plans for a $52 
million food and agricultural 
'cience building at the Davis 
campus. 

In the analysis, Hamm 
s tates the increases are 
justified because public 
universitie generally charg 
more for graduate educat ion. 
and the UC's charges for 
graduate instruction "are 
con ' iderabiy lower than 
student charges imposed by 
comparable public univer it-

About hi proposed fee

GREll WRmNG SIIRIS WITH 
AUIIIE AUIIIEB&R, 

AND A LOT OF 
When the guys at Miller asked me to 

write an ad on writing. I said. "Forget it. 
Not even If you held a gun to my head:' So 
they held a bottle of Lite Beer to my mouth. 

They're a pre11y persuasive group. 
THU5S TO MU5S 

If you're gOing to write anything. know 
what you're talking about. And that means 
three things: Research. research. and 
more research. The more you know. the 
more you can tell your reader 

Take my characters , A lot of them I 
base on actual people. There 's thiS buddy 
of mine who pops up in every book I write. 
In one story he's a cop. In another, a pri-
vate eye. Once. I made him a millionaire. 
Using him not only helped make character 
development a heck of a lot eaSier, he was 
so carried away by the rich Image, he 
boughl me a lot of free dinners (and a lot of 
Lite Beer from Miller) So use the people 
you know as models 

", 

< 
III 

Even locations should be based on 
real things. If you 're writing about a bar. 
know that bar. Hang out there. Watch the 
bartender. The customers. Whatever 
they drink, you drink. When they drink 
Lite Beer. you drink Lite Beer. Re-
member- research IS most fun when 
you soak up as much subject matter as 
you can. 11 can only help you paint a 
better picture. 

II, DOll 
No caper is complete Without dames (or ladles in proper English). Experience 

has shown me that In mystery writing. the 
sexier the dames. the better. Experience 
has also shown me that sexy scenes make 
great punctuation marks , ThiS is where 
research has the greatest potential. Use 
your own discretion in this matter. But 
when you write about it. don 't be too 
explicit That way, your reader gets to paint 
a more VIVid picture. 

by Mickey Spillane 

CAPEl TO 'APEI 
O.K. . you 've got your characters. loca-

tions. and dames lined up. Now comes the 
good part : Putting your caper to paper. 
There 's no mystery to it . As long as you 
write the ending first . the rest will follow. 
Write short. terse. to-the-point semences, 
Be as clear as possible. And make sure 
you 've got the right stuff around for when 
you get thristy. After all , writing is pretty 
thirsty work. 

I suggest a couple of mugs of Lite 
Beer- who ever heard of a caper that 
didn'linvolve a couple of mugs? 

Why Lite Beer? It's a lot like me and my 
books- great taste. less filling (some 
people can't get their fill of my books). and 
always good to spend time with. 

At any rate, follow my advice and who

story. Or you might turn out to be a heck of

Symposium offers new look at HPV S 
Scientists discuss research 

By DAVID KUPFER 
Humans have con. tru eted 

vehicles powered only by 
themselves for as long as 
human have been available to 
power them. beginning with 
dugout canoes moved by the 
power of tone Age muscle. 

Within the pa ·t decade, 
however. s trained energy 
re ources and all increased 
acce to technological 
improvements have trans· 
formed thi s activity into a 
erious need to develop the 

potential of people· powered 
modes of tran portation. 

At the Disneyland Hotel 
Conference Center, about 175 
enthusiasts of Human 
Powered Vehicles (HPVs) 
gathered for the fir t ever 
scientific ymposium of the 
International Human Powered 
Vehicle A ociation on 
November 21. [n a fully 
cheduled day, engineers, 

inventor , cientists. students 
and bicycle racers discussed 
current research and 
development of HPV and 
their mas s marketing 
possibilities. 

From what wa gathered 
during the ymposium. HPV 
represent the cutting edge of 
individual appropriate 
transport technologies for the 
future. 

The International Human 
Powered Vehicle Association 
is a non-profit organization 
dedicated to promoting 
improvement, innovation, and 
creativity in the de ign and 
development of human · 
powered transportation. 

The a sociation was 
founded by Chester Kyle after 
he convinced Olympic cyclist 
Ron Skarin to te t-ride one of 
hi s s treamlined bicycles on 
November 11 , 1974. Spinning 
down the main air . trip at Lo 
Alamito Na val Air Base, 
Skarin clocked in at 43.02 
miles per hour, a new record 
for a one·person un motorized 
vehicle. 

Unfortunately. no one 
would recognize the record . 
The International ' Cycling 
Federation would recognize 
onl y those records established 
by a standard bicycle. As a 
consequence. Kyle gat hered 
together seve ral other 
aerodynamically-minded ra· 
cers and inventors and formed 
the IHPVA . A focal point of the 
assoc iation 's \\ ork is it s 
annual sponsorship of the 

International Human Powered 
Vehicle peed Champion· 
ships. which have increasing' 
Iy drawn considerable media 
and pu blic interest to HPV . 

Introduced tn Southern 
California in 1975, thi s event 
con. istently feature innova· 
tive advance ' in technology 
and top speeds. This year 's 
HPV Speed Championship, 
held at the Lo Angeles County 
fairground s. was well 
attended. It was at thi. event 
that a fully strea mlined 
multiple·rider cycle buill by 
General Dynamics engineers 
almo t hit 63 mph. Later th 
same day. a ingle-ride vehicle 
from the same team broke the 
55 mph barrier. Although 
relatively slow rompared to 
auto racing. the e were 
incredible feat: for human 
power alone . Without 
streamlining or "drafting" 
few cycli ts have ever gone 
over 40 mph on the leve l. 

"The image of HPVs is 
getting out to the public 
through our annual interna-
tional competition," according 
to engineer AI Voight, who 
de igned and built one of the 
few HPVs now on the market. 
His "Vector," a tandem bike in 
a treamlined shell. ha been 
clocked at peeds in exces of 
62 mph and has even made a 
cro -county exhibit for the 
California Department of 
Transportation. The tandem-
driven Vector traveled [-5 
between Stockton and 
Sacramento at an average 
speed of just above 50 mph. 

Voight aid the key in HPV 
de ign i e tablishing a 
treamlined shape. "The 

aerodynamic hape of HPVs 
are by far the most important 
feature of vehicle efficiency. 
All other component mu t be 
based upon the de ign of this 
s mall surface area." He 
outlined the multitude of 
problem in HPV design: 
friction in rolling and 
transmi ion 10 se; aerody-
namic drag caused by fairings. 
wheels and internal fl ow: 
practical aspects of cornering 
and handling, including 
vi ' ibility, road clearance. rider 
comfort and power output , 
cross-wind handling. weight. 
re li abi lit y and human 
interface. crash safet y and roll 
protection . o\'erall visibilitv, 
overall handling and brakes: 

There are roadblocks to 
widespread use of IIPVs.

accordtng to G len Brown of 
CalTech, " [t 's Important for 
us to consider who our 
audience is. Within the bicycle 
market, racer would use an 
HPV maybe once a year. 
Recreational riders don't care 
to look like racers. so I don't 
perc ive any demand there. 
However. both lOurist and 
commut r needs are erved by 
HPVs: they both are fun ction· 
oriented and represent an 
excellent market. The non-
HPV enthusiast will continu 
to resist high prices, but I 
fore ee near future market 
penetration. One of the 
con traints to marketing

1979 as head of the directing 
program. He is the first person 
to be appointed to an endowed

"Alan Schneider is one of 
the major figures in the 
American theater ," s aid 
Chancellor Richard C. 
Atkin on. "We are privileged 
to have him on our faculty and 
I am pleased that he has been 
chosen as the first holder of 
the Quinn Martin chair. His 
tenure in the Quinn Martin 
chair will e tabli s h an 
admirable tandard of quality 
for t he future ."

November of 1981 with 
$250,000 from Quinn Martin.

glVes due recognition to hi~ 

superior achievements as an

George Devine - founder of

used to say, 'In the theater, 
after one get through 
satisfying one's ego, all that is 
basically left is to improve 
conditions for the next 
generation , .. ' said Schneider. 
"J hope that holding the Quinn 
Martin chair at UC San Diego 
will endow me with an even 
greater opportunity to do just 
thaL"

Warhol 
film fest. 
at UCSD 

This Sunday & Monday , 
UCSD will be the host of an 
Andy Warhol film Festival. 
Featured will be two of the 
arti t's most acclaimed. a. 
well as rare, works , In 
addition, the infamous Warhol 
superstar Ondine will be on 
hand to introduce each film 
and an wer que tions after 
each screening. 

Chelsea Girls, unday' s 
feature, was Warhol' s first 
attempt at a true feature epic. 
Running 31h hour , Chelsea 
Girls is a dou ble ·screen 
projection. This gives a vast 
wide· 'creen effect. The film 
documents some of the many 
New York personalitie who 
resided at the Chelsea H tel 
during the early sixties, (the 
least of whom are not Ondine, 
Gerard Melanga, Nico . of the 
Velvet Underground, and Edie 
Sedgewick) and all of their 
various underground sex and 
drug rituals that would later 
define the Hippie culture of the 
late sixties. This will be the 
first showing in many year. of 
this classic in its entirety. 

Vitlyl, Monday's feature , is 
perhap the mo ' t fascinating 
of all Warhol' film projects. 
By a troke of luck, Warhol 
gained the right - to Anthony 
Burges' novel , A Clockwork 
Orange, for a fraction of what 
Kubrick would pay some nine 
years later. It stars Gerard 
Melanga as the Alex character 
(renamed Victor) , Ondine as 
the rehabilitation officer and 
Edie Sedgewick a her u ual, 
beautiful, frosty elf. Anthony 
Burges , it is intere ting to 
note, claims to admire this 
version "head and shoulders" 
over Kubrick' ver ion_ 

The e are the only known 
remaining copies of the e 
works, Therefore, it must be 
emphasized that due to the 
quality of the e prints this 
may be the last showing of 
these cla ics. 

Tickets may be purcha ed in 
advance at the University Box 
Office. Admission is $2.50 
students, $3 general. For 
information call 452·4559 or 
453-9747.

Hear! on a Wall 
Jimmy Destri 
Chrysalis Records 

There' a good possibility 
that the best move Jimmy 
Destri ever made was his 
decision to record an 
album ... without Blondie. 
De tri's album would have a 
hard time living up to the 
promo sheet sent by Chrysalis, 
the record company , but it is 
good, in fact much better than 
[ had expected. Listening to it 
Ism u chI ike h a r i 11 g 
conversation with David 
Bowie while sitting in a 
Venusian steambath. 

On his premier solo album. 

may he busy on his own for 
quite a while, 

Michael Urbach-Teague 

Hey! Jimmy Destri, 
Blondie's keyboard player, has 
just released his first solo 
album! [t' called Hearl on a 
Wall and - here 's the really 
good news - its got three good 
songs! Wow! 

sp lal effe ts, propelled by 
olid drumming mixed too lo\\' . 

Destri tries to make Il all 
sound like Destri, but it 
sounds instead like Bowie or 
Roxy Music or [an Hunter or 
whomever. Su pass this one 
by. Your record money doe. n't 
go far these days anyway, and 
there definitely are more 

album IS certainly more 
punched up v..ith \.I rcus~·t1on 
than usual , and really doesn't 
sound much like Blondle. 

In fact, the more I lIstened to 
the al bum the more r realized 
that Destn is a \ery dIfficult 
artIst to categorize; I also 
began to like the album more 
and more. Songs like "Don't 
Look Around ," "The King of 
Steam," and " H art On A 
Wall " began to run through 
my mind with increaSing 
frequency after ltstening to the 
album a half-a·dozen times. 

Destri's vocal range from 
gentle melody ("LI\ ing 
In Your Heart ") to Ian 
Hunteresque ("Numb· 
ers Don't Count") to a 
sneering Roger Waters 

~tyle (" Heart on a 
Wall").

lacks the dept h and mUSIcal 
qualify that would makd it a 
great album. The music IS of 
medIocre qualtty and seems to 
ha\e no purpose, It is not 
dIrected at an audience, rather 
the feelIng is that we are 
listening In on a practICe 
esslon at theendofalongday. 

I would not recommend thl 
album as eIther a work of art 
or as a nece<;~ary album In 
your mu"ic collection. If you 
have some money to blow, and 
don't mInd Ii. tenlng to 
medIocre mU..,lc then you 
mIght ('on Ider t hIS album for 
you r rollecl1nn 

Chri<, Balls 

De tri has abandoned the 
simplicity of lhe Farfisa for the 
fuller and more sensitive 
Hammonds and electronics. 
He i also shown as a musician 
lhat believes that lyrics, 
though they may at times be 
musically clouded, do not have 
to be written to the 12 year old 
mind, a refre hing as a 
reintroduced rock concept a 
has come down the road of pop 
music in a long time. 

But here's the bad 
new : Hearl 0~1 a Wall 
i 'n't worth the eight 
dollars you'll have to 
spend to li sten to it. Its 
three good songs and a 
few ot her random 
inlere 'ling moments are 
off-set by a wealt h of 
dull , derivative mater· 
ial. With the exception 
of t he rocker "Bad 
Dreams" and "Don't 
Count On Me," and 
"Little Metal Drum -
mer" - an incongruou 
Venture '- for-the ·eight-
ie experiment with a 
Debbie Harry vocal -
none of the songs offer 
enough t melod ic or 
rhythmic hooks to carry 
one much beyond an 
ab 'ent·minded toe-tap

Destri Ip

backing vocal, and blends 
well with De tri o 

The songs range from gentle 
guitar to hard driving rock, 
and far-out b lend of 
synthesizer-gui tar with a faint 
taste of Pink Floyd and David 
Bowie. The music is good and 
eq ually 0 the lyrics. [ 
particularly enjoyed the hard 
driving "Don 't Look Around" 
a song of paranoid tendencie 
apd the softer melodies of the 
ti\le song, "Heart on a Wall." 

Greg Farkas 
Jimmy Destri's first solo 

effor t after the demise of 
Blond ie, Hearl on a Wa ll, 
s hows strong potential for 
future development, but his 
initial impact on the music 
industry is bound to be 
Ie ened by the fact that he i a 
virtuall y unknown component 
of the char t-topping Blondie. 
Wh ile comparisons of his 
songwri ting/ si nging style can 
be made to Bowie's or U2's 
Bono, Destri more closely 
approaches the R & R/pop 
sounds that theother two lack. 

Produced by Mi chael 
Kamen , the album's strongest 
segments ce nt er arou nd 
tracks that carryon the 

records 
Blondie tradition. "Little 
Metal Drummer" is undoub-
ted ly the Ip' most ensational 
track, involving a pleasant 
me lodic line and vocal 
harmonies supported by the 
familiar sounding Debbie 
Harry. Unfortunately , this 
Blondiesque ong is mi lead· 
ing, asJimmy Destri reverts to 
vocal harmonies dominated by 
male choruses. All in all , it 
shows a spark of hope for 
future success. but time will 
be the telling factor. 

Clark Westmont 
Blondie is unquestionably 

an economic success in the 
rock and roll marketplace. 
Complete with a network of 
diverse contributing talent, 
the band has been able to 
explore several avenues 
within their framework. Yet 
out of the group context, the 
sum of the parts doesn't seem 
to equal the whole. This is 
true, anyway , of Jimmy 
Destri's first 010 effort , Heart 
011 a Wall. 

The credits claim member 
of the Blondiecampon backing 
vocals with Chris Stein adding 
hi s finesse on one cut, "Little 
Metal Drummer." which 
might as wel l have appeared 
on a Blondie LP . Although 
written by Deslri , as all of the 
tunes are, it 's not unus ual for 
the ong to fall into a sound· 
alike syndrome. Especially 
when one considers how many 
hits he 's helped to peg for 
Blondie. 

Aside from that cut, mos t of 
the ot her tracks seem like 
sound-alikes that have been 
ripp d off from other groups 
amongst the likes of Bowie, 
Ray Davies, an ill -sounding 
John Cale (both voice and 
lyrics) and Ian Hunter. 

Maybe that 's Deslri 's intent 
- who knows? What I do 
know i this album sounds as 
if it were recorded to be played 
for th Graduating Class of 
Kindergarten .

It' still a little early for the tax 

man to be arriving, and noone I know 
died yesterday, except maybe a few 
rabbits, but at the conclusion of the 
annual UC D Super, tar All- ports 
Competition this past unday, one 
thing wa for certain. 

Craig Kreeger and Rick Wilbert are 
definitely the two best all-around 
athletes at UC D, That much'was 
proved for the third traight year a 
kreeger regained the Super tars 
Individual Championship that he lost 
to Wilbert last year, And , while doing 
it, Kreeger just happened to turn in 
the best individual performance in 
the event' even-year hi tory with a 
milestone setting 6064 points. 
Wilbert finished 'econd with merely 
the fourth be t point total ever at 
5687. 

These guys would do well in the yo· 
yo bu -ine (they'd probably be good 
in that event also!). Because for the 
past three years that' all these two 
have done with the up rstars event. 

Kreeger , winning the event in his 
fir t try at it a' a 1980 sophomore, 
totaled an out tanding th n-record 
performance of 5805. Wilbert one·

upped him last year with an even 
more incredible effort of !)!}!)4, 

And then came this year, Kreeger, 
a senior at Re\'elle, \vas not to be 
denied , He had the kind of weekend 
an athlete dream of. Near perfection. 
He was definitely on the money, 
Opening with a 6.78 clocking in the 
60-yard da h on Thru_ day, you knew 
Craig was warming up to the task. 

On Friday , he bowled a 214 game at 
the Clairemont Lane for a new 
Superstars bowling mark, 

It was a mark he cherished perhaps 
even more than the overall mark , 
''I've been after that one since I 
started in this competition," he said , 
"Y'know, a well as I've done in this 
thing overall, I've never held an 
individual event record . I thought 
bowling might be my only chance," 
He was right. And in the end, it was 
that mark that proved to be the 
cat alyst for hi run at the overall 
record, 

Looking constantl y over hi s 
shou Ider to keep tabs on what 
Wil rt was doing, Kreeger went mto 
the thtrd day well-placed behind 
second da~ leader Rosendo Lu o.

Meanwhile, Wilb rt. was busy 
carving out his u ual solid mark , 
and was always within st riking 
distance, 

As they entered the Sa ketball 
upershot com pet ition late Saturday 

morning, t he event was sti ll up for 
grabs, But, Kreeger had to a little 
edgy . 

Basketball hooting, after all, was 
Wilbert's forte , He has literally 
owned this event for the past two 
years, maxi ng the 'coring table (] ,000 
pts.) two years ina row wit h a superb 
out ide shooting touch . 

A \'ery good shooter himself, 
Kreeger was behind the 8-ball to be 
sure, A. a stun ned audience looked 
on, Kreeger went out and canned 15 
t urn·around 13-footers in 16 attempts, 
and then polished off his performance 
with a 22-foot jumper that ripped 
gently through the cords as the one-
minute trial elapsed. 16 out of 18shot 
in I minute! Truly amazing! In one of 
those rare moments in sport , 
e\'eryone 10 the gymnasium, mo t of 
them competitors themselves, 
worrying about their own 
performances, broke out in 

spontaneous applause. 
Kreeger knew he was back in the 

driver's seat, but maybenotyetoutof 
the garage, Wilbert, pumped up by 
Kreeger's torrid shooting, decided to 
s hoot next , like only he can. Going 
:-;t rictly for the long-range s hots at 22-
feet, Rick gave it more than the good 
oJ' college try, He blistered the net , 
quickly hitting !) jumpers in a row 
before having two heartbreakers dip 
in and out just before the buzzer. It 
was not enough. 

Kreeger had established a 350 pomt 
lead in the comp tilion, and the rest 
was academic . In Sunday's events, 
Kreeger and Wilbert traded routine 
performances in the high -j ump and 
mile. And Kreeger waltzed home with 
a new record. 

It may be short-lived, however, 
Wilbert, an intense competitor if 
there ever was one, is already 
marking hi. sights on next year's 
competition. It will be hi ' last. 
(Kreeger graduates this June.) 

"Craig was great this year, but I 
think r can get it back," he said softly. 
Just looking into his eyes, you know 
he wi II.

Superstar competitors don't fit jock stereotype 
By SCOTT YOUNG 

Slaff Wriler 
"I don't just want a li st of 

. tati tic ," my editor aid, in 
reference to my coverage of the 
Seventh Annual UCSD 
Superstars All -Sports 
Competition. " I don't want 
only to know who won each 
event. I want you to follow 
somebody throu~h it , get a 
different focus.' I nodded 
diligently and walked out of 
the Guardian office cratching 
my head, "Follow?" [ though, 
."He want me to tag along like 
a spaniel or a kid brother 
watching some animal jock 
beat hi brain out for four 
days in a series of disjointed 
sport events?!" (Remember, 
these folks were running, 
swimming, weightlifting, 
bowling, shooting baskets, 
high jumping, kicking field 
goals, throwing softballs, and 
on and on".) I shook my head in 
disbelief. looked around for a 
free airplane ticket to New 
Zealand, and headed towards 
the Recreation Department 
Little did I realize how wrong I 
was, and little did my editor 
dream what angle I was going 
to take, 

Down at the Rec. Office, r 
explained my story to Mike 
Hip, a nice guy who always 
'eemed to be sweating it out 
over a typewriter. He s hook his 
head, too, and handed me a 
stack of papers, full of rules, 
tatlstics, and various bits of 

information. He al 0 gave me a 
couple of phone numbers of 
people who had done well over 
the last few years. I decided to 
cover the tory from a 

woman's point of view, seeing 
as how there so few women , 
competing in this incredibly 
grueling four day physical 
trauma (at least that's what I 
thought). I chose last year's 
freshman winner, Kim 
Haddad, All I knew then was 
that she could bench press 140 
pounds, It takes little 
creativity to imagine my 
mental picture of her at that 
time. 

The next day, Thursday, 
Feb, 25, I attended the first 
event of the Superstar' 
competition - the sixty-yard 
dash, I just assumed that I'd 
look for the biggest, burliest 
woman t here and ask her a few 
questions. To make a long 
s tory even longer, there 
weren't any meaty women 
there, and there weren't too 
many mu scle- bound guys 
either. I guess all the lunk-
headed All -American Muscle 
Beach Beer Belly Behemoths 
must have had other 
engagements pulling up tree 
somewhere else, because I saw 
a bunch of normal (to a degree) 
UCSD students; everything 
from econ majors running the 
sixty in topsiders (without 
socks, of course) to physics 
tudents calculating the wind 

speed and direction, and using 
vector analysi to determine 
the correct angle to throw the 
softball. trange t of all, they 
were all smiling,laughing, and 
having a good time; they 
weren't even covered with 
mud , weat, bruise, and half-
shaved beards (t hat was the 
rugby team practicing one 
field over), "Th is isn't going to 

be too bad," I though , pulling 
out my pen and notebook, and 
scribbling a few undecipher-
able notes, Soon enough, since 
I must have looked like an FBI 
agent or a reporter or 
something, somebody came 
over and tarted reading over 
my shou lder. "From the 
Guardian," I muttered, then 
added, "Want to be intervie-
wed?" He stepped back, with a 
surprised look on his face. 
"Hell no," he said. shocked, 
then walked away , hakinghi 
head , (Tu rned out to be Eddie 
Lee, the guy who subsequently 
won the sixty in 6.63, a 
respectable time to be sure,) I 
decided I would have to be 
careful about naming my 
newspaper affiliation, Didn 't 
want to scare too many people 
off. I'd tell them I was a 
wandering port poet, or 
trying to figure out how to tell 
time with my pen, 

It was a nice day, sunny and 
not too cold, and there were 
about fifty or sixt y people 
around, most of them 
competitors. The firs t couple 
of guys to run t he sixty-yard 
dash brought in some fast 
times, 6.13 and 6.21. The 
timer's eyes bugged out, Mike 
got a worried look on hi. face 
and the runners got pretty 
ec tatic. According to the,e 
time, they were world record 
holders, new champions in 
mternational track, omebody 
mentioned this to Mike, who 
called everything to a halt, and 
re-measured the track, Came 
out to I 161 feet, 19 feet 
shorter than the sixty yard 
requirement. Fourth-year

competitor Hal LIght , who 
eventually placed 10th in the 
individ ual co m petl t ion, 
guiltily admitted that it was 
his error, but nobody got mad. 
It was too early to get mad; 
later, after all the fal se starts, 
was the time to get mad . 

Evidently, the fal. e tarts 
were a re ult of malfunction of 
the tarting gun , The runners, 
however, were getting more 
and more nervous a the delay 
continued and began millmg 
around, muttering mutinou -
Iy. Finally, the race went off. 
and the fir t heat brought in 
the winning time. Somebody 
in the crowd mentioned that 
this delay and mix-up should 
be in the Guardian . Clandes· 
tinely, r s nuck out my 
notebook and cribb led 
furiously, 

By thl!> tim '. I wa~ 
beginning to wonder who Kim 
Haddad was, so I wandered on 
over to the starting line and 
opened up my ear. Sure 
enough , I soon heard her 
name, and when I looked, 
expecting a burly Amazon, I 
aw instead a lim, tan 

woman, no more than 130 
pounds, and no more than 
about 5'6", Sure, she was in 
good shape, but I just couldn't 
ee her sweating it out in a 

weight room. She wasn't the 
Raw-Egg-and,Protein-Powder 
type of person. Following her 
through the competltiondidn 't 
seem so bad after all. 

When I talked to Kim (after 
she ran an 8.06 to be first in 
her heat and second among 
women), she was casual about

a lot of intramural sports, but 
that' about it...I'm not super 
into it, but I want to win ." h 
L an econ major (no topsiders). 
and he is bored WIth chool 
here. (Ring a bell?) I a ked her 
what got her into the 
competition, how she 
happened tu sign up, and she 
replied, "Well, last year, the 

day before it s tarted. my 
bo~'friend and I just walked in 
and sa\\' :-,ome ~t uff in the Rec. 
OffIce, and signed up. I didn't 
ha\'e any 'port t hal I wa good 
at. I mean real good at. I gues 
my best is weightlifting, since 
I got the 010 t points. But I 
don 't lift weights at all." 
Casual Kim run. in the econd 
heat with the four fastest 
women. and looks, WIth her 
neck veins bulging and h r 

hands up, as if she ,,"ould kill 
to win . Fortunatel), she 
doesn't have to, she wins I his 
race anyway. Butthe times are 
slower, so she st ill places 
sec nd. "I gue s I do get 
competitIve, after all! " she 
says, smi ling. 

Th com pet il ion goes on, for 
four days. For Kim, it' s a good 
time, the pressure get s high in 
the closed-in events, like 
weightlift ing and basket ball, 

\\ hen everyone stands around, 
but the bowling and the rest 
are "all a lot of fun" she says. 
In general. every body cheers 
on anybody who puts out a 
good effort, regardles of 
\Vh ther they are team 
members or not. Team 
capt ains run around calcula-
'ting points and determining 
who needs get how many 
points in the next event and so 
on. 

"Wait 'til ncxt year, because I 
am going to beat Kreeger' s 
record." When informed later, 
K re ger replied, "Tell him 
that I'd like to see that," 
accompanied by chuckle - from 
hi s girlfriend in the 
backgrou nd. 

Howard Hunt: Patriarch of sports As the events go by, senior Craig Kreeger pulls ahead, ~coring consistently well, ,md 
"etting a new bowling record 
with a score of 214. Kreeger 
goes on towin the competition 
with a new record of 606-1 
points. "Since it wa~ my last 
year, I wanted to go all out. [ 
won it as a ophomore, and 
then lost last year to Ri ck 
(Wilbert, second place this 
year), so this year I had to go 
for it." 

As for Kim , she took first m 
the women's Individual 
com petit ion t hi ' year, wit h a 
score of 4979. This places her 
at fir. t in the women's 
freshman (last year's) and 
sophomore class standings, 
'econd and fifth in the all-time 
top ten women' cores and 
13th in the overall individual
