Seven fires whipped through southern California yes terday, including one which burned 
into San Diego County last night, sending smoke and as h as far south as La Jolla. That fire -
which had burned over 12,000 acres by dusk - wa just one of the many blazes driven by gale-
force Santa Ana winds that pushed flames through tinder-dry brush as far north as Malibu 
Beach near Los Angeles. (See story below.) 

Results of probe into police 
actions at reception delayed 

The investigation of police 
conduct at last month's 
reception for Chancellor 
Atkinson will not be finished 
until "probably mid-winter," 
AS President Bill Topkis said 
yesterday. 

Problems in coordinating 
the proposals for a task force 
from the AS and the 
chancellor's office are blamed 
for the delay by Topkis. The 
investigation was supposed 

to be completed by the end of 
this Quarter. 

It will look at charges that 
police abused students 
physically in removing them 
from a picket line outside an 
Oct. 5 reception by UC 
President David Saxon to 
honor Atkinson's assump-
tion oLthe chancellorship. 

Topkis said he hoped to 
meet with Chancellor 's 
Assistant Pat Collum today to 

Fires scorch Southland, 
rain ashes on county 

Two wind-whipped brush 
fires burning out of control 
near Lake Elsinore sent 
ashes raining down on 
northern San Diego County 
yesterday, with smoke from 
both blazes visi ble as far 
south as UCSD. 

By nightfall, one of the 
fires still raged unchecked , 
and fire officials said they 
could not predict when the 

~'Turner Fire," which had 
already burned over 12,000 
acres ' in the Cleveland 
National Fore t, would be 
controlled. 

The other fire, which 
charred about 500acresju t 
north of Lake EI inore, was 
fully controlled at du k. 

And, UCSD st udent 
driving in from outlying 
areas arrived here ye ter-
day morning with their car 
covered with ashe . 

The fire that filled the 
air of San Diego with their 

moke and odor were not 
the only blazes burning out 
of control in southern 
California. Five other fires 
- stretching from Malibu 
Beach near Los Angele to 
Bradbury-Duarte in the San 
Gabriel Mountain near 
San Bernardino -consumed 
over 30 000 acres of tin r-

dry brush, reducing over 
100 homes to smoldering 
ru bble and killing at least 
one man. 

The flames were fanned 
by the hurricane force 
Santa Ana wind that swept 
through-southern Califor-
nia yesterday. 

As the Turner fire pushed 
its way into San Diego 
County, threatening the 
communities of Fallbrook 
and DeLuz , Riverside 
County Sheriff deputies 
announced that they had 
taken an unidentified man 
into custody on charges he 
allegedly set the blazes. 

A fire burned for a time 
above Pacific Palisad s, 
where the home of 
Pre ident-elect Ronald 
Reagan is situated. But city 
fire official s'aid the blaze 
was contained and never 
threatened any home . 

Resident of Bradbury, a 
ru tic community of Ie 
than 10,000 people 20 mile 
northea t of Los Angele , 
were advi ed by authorities 
to evacuate after a roaring 
firestorm covered 10,000 
acres there.

iron out the purpose and 
structure of the committee, 
and said he hoped to have 
final agreement by Wednes-
day. 

After that, committee 
appointments will still have 
to be made. 

The AS approved its 
understanding of what the 
committee should do last 
Wednesday. 

The AS amended a 
proposal by Vice President 
Warren Wheeter, who has 
taken a lead in forming the 
task force, to demand a 
concentration on the events 
of the Oct. 5. reception. 

The administration has 
tried to emphasize that the 
task force should concentrate 
on ways of handling similar 
protests and events in the 
future. 

Committee gives 
Atkinson plans 

Will pick one of four 
BY JENIFER WARREN 

Aaeoc:late New. Editor 

Four proposals redefining 
the rolls of adminstrative 
offices will be considered by 
Chancellor Richard Atkinson 
this week. 

The proposals-one of 
which could lead to a 
marked im,Tease in student 
influence in student 
affairs- were formulated by 
an advisory committee to the 
chancellor charged with 
i nvestiga ting possible 
changes in the campus 
administrative structure. 

The committee decided in a 
meeting Friday to submit 
four proposal to Atkinson 
for his inspection rather than 
recommend just one of the 
plans to him. 

Students on the advisory 
committee are in favor of the 
proposal that would place 
academic services (OASIS, 
Educationals Opportunity 
Program, Retention and 
Recruitment, and Registrar 
and Admissions), housing 
and food services, the 
University Bookstore and 
possibly the Day Care Center 
under the auspicies of the 
Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs. 

"I'd really like to see 
housing and food . services 
moved to student affairs," 
said AS President and 
committee member Bill 
Topkis. "The bookstore and 
Day Care would also be better 
if not run from the business 
perspective," he added. 

Topkis cited the high 
bookstore prices and the 
"problems students have had 
with housing and food 
services" as areas that might 
be improved i;hould those 
services be moved to student 
affairs. 

The AS Council voted 
unanimously last Wednes-
day to endorse this proposal 
- model three - stating that 
"these vital services should 

be run in a student-oriented 
manner." 

Physics Professor William 
Frazer, chairman of the 
advisory committee, declined 
to comment specifically on 
the report that will be sent to 
Atkinson, but did say that he 
felt "no one proposal is 
clearly preferable. 

"We have the present 
organizational structure, 
which may still be adequate, 
and the we have the most 
drastic change in proposal 
four, which would move 
undergraduate cirriculum 
under the control of student 
affairs," he said. 

He believes that "Chancel-
lor Atkinson will seek a lot 
more input before he makes a 
decision. " 

But Topkis indicated that 
he feels "the Chancellor will 
lean toward model three. 
Placing undergraduate 
curriculum under student 
affairs (as specified in model 
four) m~ be too drastic a 
change. The college provosts 
seem to favor model three and 
the AS has made it clear 
which proposal we support." 

Yet the committee did 
reach a concensus on one 
matter. The need to establish 
specific Qualifications for the 
Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs and Academic Affairs 
positions, both of which will 
be filled by next August, is 
seen as an immediateconcem 
by the committee. 

"Our primary goal now is 
to determine what kind of 
qualifications the new Vice 
Chancellors of Academic 
Affairs and Student Affairs 
will need to meet," Topkis 
said. 

"If academic services are 
placed under the auspicies of 
student affairs. we will need

I was greatly appalled and

(The Daily Guardian, Nov. 
12). I thou~ht that someone 
had slipped a pornographic 
newspaper in the stack of The 
Daily Guardians. How can a 
patriotic paper like this print 
uch trash? Is not a guardian 

supposed to protect the

bad editorial judgment 
Editor: 

Your publishing of the 
Nov. 12 letter titled "Unite 
for Orgasms" showed 
extreme poor taste and lack 
of discretion. 

Human sexuality is a very 
beautiful and special thing. I 
feel sorry for whoever wrote 
that letter. He's probably 
been used and abused 
sexually and is very confused 
about sex, life and love. 
Undoubtedly, he has little 
regard for dignity of man. All 
I can say to him if he's 
reading this letter is that God 
really loves him , and, 

re~ardless of what this world 
mIght tell him , he is 
significant and meaningful in 
the eyes of God. 

In the future you ought to 
consider your reputation as 
an editor and overseer of a 
newspaper. Publishing such

We demand 
our share 
Editor: 

In response to the recent 
letter, "Unite for Or~~~ms," 
the women ofWAPE (Women 
Against Premature Ejacula-
tion) have the following 
comments. 

First of all, we'd like to 
point out the greediness and 
self-interest of the members 
of MENTOO. You talk about 
wanting multiple orgasms 
when half of the time, due to 
premature ejaculation , we 
don't experience the ecstasy 
of orgasm at all. When was 
the last time you men had sex 
which didn't end orgasmi-
cally? This is a problem 
women encounter time and 
time again, so why shouldn't 
we demand multi-orgasm 
occasionally? 

Furthermore, how can you 
men demand more than one 
orgasm when you can't even 
surpass your weakness of 
ejaculating even before we've 
had time to warm up? 

The members of WAPE 
feel women have endured 
this inconvenience far too 
long and we pro~e you 
develop those 'mental 
gymnastics" that you brag of 
in order to give us the 
numerous pleasures we 
deserve. You can hardly say 
"men ... keep coming and 
coming and coming," becau e 
you guys are just like finals 
- you always come too soon!

for me to overcome.

I have leRrned to be a

didn't know what to expect 
when I was invited to a

condo. The hostess told me to 
bring a bottle of Crisco oil , so 
I assumed she was serving 
food. Boy, was I ever wrong! 
You wouldn't believe what

PSA flights back in the

Passengers happy, 'Pilots not satisfied 
Many UCSD students 

faced a long walk home for 
the holidays this year as a 
strike by Pacific Southwest 

Airl~iIots and engineers 
IfOUIi jets bound for cities 
throughout California and 
thewest. 

But relief came yesterday 
as PSA toOk to the air again 
with free drinks for 
passenaers on 80 scheduled 
flights to seven cities, 
following the strike that had 
idled the airline for 50 days. 

There were few ~gers 
on yesterday's flights, said

with customers eager to 
reserve flights for the

Hastmgs was on three of 
the first flights yesterday "to 
make sure everything went 
as planned." He said it was a 
"jovial group" aboard the 
plane, 

"Passengers were happy 
because it makes traveling 
around the state easier and 
the flight attendants were 

happy because they were 
working again," he said, 

A majority of the pilots, 
however, were not happy.

Measles may be gone in two years 
ATLANTA AP - Mea-

s les, the pink-spotted disease 
that was almost lin 
inescapable part of an 
American childhood only 20 
years ago, could be just two 
years h-om extinction in the 
United States, 

Federal public health 
officials are c;losinQ in, rjding 
the succeSs 'of a 'drive to 
immunize the nation 's 
schoolchildren against 
measles and other common 
vaccine-preventable dis-
eases, 

"We are attempting to 
eliminate measles as a native 
disease in the United States 
by Oct. 1982," said Dr. Alan 
Hinman , director of the 
immunization division of the 

national Centers for Disease 
Control. 

In the 1950s, about half a 
million people each year -
mostly ,., children - pent 
several days coughing, 
sniffling, running fevers and 
sprinkled with the distinc-
tive itchy spots of the 
measles, I 1" 

The hi~hly contagious 
measles virus was spread, 
usually in the classroom, by 
the coughing and sneezing of 
those about to show their 
spots. Introduction of a 
measles vaccine in 1963 had 
an immediate and drastic 
effect, cutting the annual 
measles count by more than 
90 percent. 

But as measles and other 

childhood diseases become 
rarer, parents grew lax about 
getting their c h ildren 
vaccinated . By April 1977, 
public heath officials 
estimated that 20 million 
children lacked protection 
agai nst one or another 
important disease, 

The immunization drive 
launched in 1977 has been a 
success, Hinman said. Now 
90 percent of the nation's 
schoolchildren are fully 
protecterl and the figures are 
even better for kids first 
entering school. 

As a result, only 13,587 
cases of measles were 
counterllast year, theall-time 
low, In the first 44 weeks of 
1980, the CDC recorded 

13,095 ca es of measles, 
slightly ahead of last year's 
pace, So far this year there 
have been eight deaths from 
measles, 

Not only are the number of 
cases dropping the remaining 
cases are increasi ngly 
isola ed . More than 75 
percent of the nation's 
counties - and the entire 
states of Idaho, Iowa, Oregon, 
South Dakota and Wyoming 
- have had no measles cases 
at all this year. ' 

"It's a disease which is 
focal now, both in time and 
place," Hinman said. "Nearly 
10 percent of the cases this 
year were from Milwaukee, 
which had a major out-
break." 

Friends wish you luck 
on a big-exam. Gooil friends .stick 

around to see how you did. 

They say they were just 
hanging around killing time and 
by the way, "How did you do?" 
You teD them a celebration is in 
order and that you're buying the 

'1l beer. "Look," one of them says, 
"If you did that weD, buy us 
something special." Tonight, let 
it be Uiwenbriiu.

liSider 
Since college traditionally is a time when income falls 
short of outgo, finding a happy medium can be tough. To 
make the balancing act as painless as possible, we've 
assembed a wealth of tips to help you tap the cash flow and 
channel it for maximum effect. Read and reapl 

What Econ tOt Never Tauqht You ... 4 
We're not talking supply and demand here. We're talking 
monetary nitty-gritty- plastic in your pocket, life or debt, 
those bothersome rubber checks, and bill collectors camp-
ing out at your door. (And, we promise, not one word about 
budgets.) 

Shoppinq Smart ...•.•.•.•............. 6 
Whether it's textbooks for less than a dollar each or a 
stereo for two-thirds the list price, we offer Simple strat-
egies for making the most of every dollar. 

Gimme Cheap Shelter ............... 9 
Putting a roof over your head needn't put you over your 
budget. Our apt tips for apartment-hunters can save you 
cash and legal hassles. And, student profiles show you how 
to home in on housing alternatives (and maybe even make 
a few bucks in the process) , 

Ripoff Remedies ..................... t6 
Getting the most value for your money doesn 't stop at the 
point of purchase. When that newly installed muffler bites 
the dust, do you know how to toot your horn? Here you 'll 
find sound advice on your rights as a consumer as well as 
where to turn for help. 

How To Prosper During 
The Cominq ColIeqe year .......... t8 
Who couldn't use some extra cash? The earning options 
range from "effortless work" to entrepreneurship. Plus, 
we've included plenty of valuable guidelines for tracking 
down financial aid sources. 

Living On Less........ . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. 22 
It's one thing to shop around for the best prices. But if 
broke-and-hungry is your perpetual state, if your idea of 
dining out is popcorn with the pigeons, and if a typical night 
on the town is a mass-transit bus tour of the city, we offer 
hope by giving new meaning to the word "cheap."

Sowi~Your 
Savin~s 
The more frequently it's 
compounded, the more you 
earn. Remember this rule 
about savings accounts, and 
you 'll be smarter than most 
banking customers. 

Other points of interest 
to consider in choosing a 
savings account: 

Find out when the inter-
est is credited to the account 
and schedule your withdraw-
als after that date. Other-
wise, unless you have a 
"grace period," you 'll lose 
interest on the funds you 
withdraw. Also ask if you'll 
be penalized for frequent 
withdrawals or rewarded 
for fewer ones. 

Determine when your 
savings will start to earn 
interest. The best account 
will pay interest from the 
day of deposit to the day of 
withdrawal. 

LessTaxin~ 
Taxes 
If Uncle Sam sent you a 
large tax refund this year, 
you probably lost money. 

Asking an employer to 
withhold more tax money 
from your paycheck than is 
required seems a fail-safe 
way to save (and for some 
of us , the only way) . 

But consider the inter-
est to be earned if you ex-
empted yourself fmm with-
holding and, with a little 
willpower, put the money in 
a savings account. There 
are certain prescribed con-
ditions, however, so ask your 
employer about eligibility 
for exemption.

Beyond a 
Shadow 
Ofa 
Debt 
You 're in debt. Your tele-
phone has been disconnected, 
burly bill collectors wait at 
the door, and you've scraped 
up just enough cash for a 
one-way ticket to Iceland. 

Wait. The worst thing 
you can do is avoid your 
creditors, says John E. Ses-
tina, a financial planner in 
Columbus, Ohio. That's a 
sure way to ruin your future 
credit rating. 

"Notify your creditors 
and explain your circum-
stances," he says. "Most 
are willing to help." Sestina 
suggests partial payments, 
deferred charges, and pay-
ment reductions as practi-
cal alternatives to not pay-
ing at all . 

If your creditors turn 
unpaid bills over to a collec-
tion agency, "be concerned, 
but don't panic," Sestina 
advises. And as for those 3 
a.m. phone calls, it's illegal 
for a bill collector to disturb 
you at odd hours or to harass 
and threaten you with other 
tactics. 

If you must borrow to 
payoff debts, Sestina out-
lines the following sources: 
Credit Unions: 
If you or your parents work 
for a firm that has a credit 
union , these loans are usu-
ally- but not always- less 
expensive than bank loans. 
Bank Loans: 
The cheapest is a short-
term (one year or less) loan . 
Life Insurance: 
Borrowing against your pol-
icy is considerably less ex-
pensive than a bank loan , 
but the face value of the 
policy is reduced by the 
unpaid balance of the loan . 
Finance Companies: 
Since interest rates can be 
as high as 20 percent a year, 
these loans should be a last 
resort. 

Question and Answer: 
Follow the 
Bouncin~ Check 

Qo Why did my check o bounce? I had enough 
in account. 

Ao Maybe you didn't. When o you deposit a check from 
another bank, such as a 
check from home, it takes 
from three to 15 days before 
it's cleared and credited to 
your account. Clearing time 
varies, so ask your bank 
about this. 

Q 0 What type of checking 
o account is the cheapest? 

Ao A free account that re-o quires no minimum bal-
ance. (If a minimum bal-
ance is required and your 
account drops below it , 
you 're stuck with a fee .) 
Your hometown bank may 
provide free checking with 
no minimum balance as a 
service to students away at 
college, but beware of banks 
that offer this as a lure to 
customers and then raise 
rates later. A "per check" 
service fee is cheapest if 
you write only a few checks 
a month.

Q 0 Can I make money with 
o an interest-paying check-

ing account? 

Ao No, not you keep a low o balance. With these ac-
counts, banks usually charge 
a fee if your account drops 
below a minimum balance. 
These fees, combined with 
typical per check fees, would 
probably outweigh the in-
terest you would earn on a 
balance of a few hundred 
dollars . 

A Painless 
Guide to

Does the mere mention of a 
budget make you wince? 
Do concepts of personal 
finance boggle your mind? 

In one of the clearest

Cash Card 
Caveats 
A budgetary blessing or a 
financial fiasco? Whatever 
your attitude toward 24-hour 
automated bank tellers, you 
should be aware of a recent 
law which limits your liabil-
ity in case an unauthorized 
transfer is made with a lost 
or stolen card. 
. If you notice the card is 
missing, let the bank know 
immediately . Your liability 
is limited to $50 if the bank 
is notified within two busi-
ness days of the card's loss 
or theft. 

For protection against 
theft, customers are warned 
to keep their personal iden-
tification number separate 
from their debit card, to 
place a limited amount of 
funds in these accounts , and 
to keep careful records of 
all transactions.

Q: Our current econom-
ic situation seems pretty 
dismal. Is there any hope on 
the horizon? 

A: I think inflation is 
going to continue for many 
years, but that doesn't neces-
sarily mean things are dis-
mal. Oddly enough, while 
prices have doubled in the 
last 10 years, wages have 
more than doubled. 

Although the past year 
and a half hasn 't been very 
good, the '70s as a whole has 
shown gains in real income, 
and I think that's going to 
continue in the next 10 years. 

As far as the job outlook 
goes, graduates starting to 
enter the work force now 

. are part of the baby-bust 
generation, and they're go-
ing to be in a much better 
position to find jobs than the 
preceding baby-boom gen-
eration. 

The economy expanded 
tremendously to accommo-
date the baby-boom workers. 
Consequently, when a small-
er number of workers (the 
baby-bust generation) comes 
up behind, the question be-
comes, "Who is going to fill 
all these jobs that were 
opened 'by the past gener-
ation?"

cial writer. recipient of the

Achievement Award. young-
est member on the board of

Savings and Loan League. 

Q: How can I make the 
most of my money while 
I'm in college? 

A: Overall, a financial 
plan is important. Map out 
exactly what your remain-
ing in-school costs will be, 
everything from books to 
entertainment. Then try to 
pinpoint all the resources 
from family, work, aid, and 
scholarships. From this , 
map out a specific plan and 
follow it. 

I would also strongly 
suggest that you save money. 
I'm appalled at the money I 
threw away in college just 
on normal living expenses. 
If you could start saving 
now, you could prepare your-
self for leaving school and 
getting a job, especially if it 
takes a little time. 

I'd recommend getting 
a job in the field you want to 
pursue after graduation . 
And if a student wanted to 
start a small business, I'd 
strongly encourage it. 

Barbara Gilder Quint, finan-
cial expert, writer for Mon-
eyandGlamourmagazines. 

Q: I have money in a 
savings account for next 
year's tuition . Is this the 
best place to keep it? 

A: Your money in a 
savings account is absolute-
ly safe; it's insured by an 
agency of the federal gov-
ernment, and it's also very 
accessible. 

However, day-of-depos-
it-to-day-of-withdrawal ac-
counts pay only 51h percent 
interest, and even one-year 
accounts rarely pay more 
than 6 to 61h percent. So why 
not consider shifting your 
money to one of the new 
money funds? 

In the last six months, 
they've been paying between 
7 and 10 percent interest. 
You have instant access at 
any time to your money 
and, although they 're not 
insured as with a savings 
account, most experts be-
lieve they are very safe.

ington, D.C. 20006.) 

To Your Credit 
Despite flu ctuating federal 
credit-ca rd controls, college 
students- especially gradu-
ating seniors- may find it 
easier to get credit cards 
than the general public does. 

Because college students 
usually charge only small 
items and pay their bills 
promptly, they're "excel-
lent credit customers," says 
George Stealy of Sears, Roe-
buck & Company. 

Art Clark, a vice-presi-
dent of the card division at 
American Express, agrees. 
"For graduating seniors, our 
application requirements 
are less stringent than our 
ordinary standards ," he 
says. Why ? Graduating sen-
iors are more likely to find 
better-paying jobs, and thus 
are better credit risks. 

Underclassmen without 
impressive salaries, how-
ever, carry little clout with 
the nationally accepted 
credit-card companies. Yet 
some retail stores (Sears, 
for example) don 't have min-
imum-income requirements. 
"The only real provision is 
an adequate income- not 
necessarily a job- to make 
payments," Stealy says. 

Once you have a credit 
card, the most effective way 
to fight inflation with it is to 
charge new purchases im-
mediately after the billing 
date on the monthly state-
ment. Charged items won 't 
appear on your account until 
the next billing date- about 
30 days later. 

After you receive the 
monthly bill , you have up to 
25 days to pay it before in-
terest is added. Thus, al-
most two interest-free months 
elapse before you have to 
pay for your purchases. 

Before you congratulate 
yourself for being such a 
savvy shopper, one caution: 
Always pay monthly bills in 
full to avoid interest charges. 

But what if your credit-
card application is refused ? 
You have the right to know 
specifically why you were 
turned down. If you feel you 
have been unfairly rejected , 
ask the creditor first. The 
regional offices of the Fed-
eral Trade Commission may 
also be able to help.

HOPPING SMART 
Are You Gonzo at the Grocery? 
If you like to race down 
supermarket aisles whip-
ping convenience foods into 
your cart, you might think 
careful shopping is for bored 
homemakers. " After all ," 
you reason, ' 'I'm in college; 
I don 't have time to shop or 
cook." 

But the "supermarket 
sweep" game puts a strain 
on your wallet, not to men-
tion unwary shoppers stand-
ing in your way. Consumer 
experts say that a painless 
bit of extra time- in food 
shopping and preparation-
saves lots of bucks. Here 's 
their advice : 
SIZE UP PRICES. Brand X 
dog food is $5 for 10 pounds; 

6 INSIDER 

Brand Z is $6.50 for 12. Which 
is cheaper? Several states 
and cities require stores to 
give the price per unit (ounce, 
pound) so that the consum-
er can compare costs of 
differently sized packages. 
If a store offers no unit 
prices, bring along a calcu-
lator and figure them your-
self. That "economy-size" 
may not be so economical. 
DON'T JUDGE A CAN BY 
ITS LABEL. Store brands 
are usually 2 to 33 percent 
cheaper than name brands, 
and the quality is compar-
able. Better yet, try the no-
frills generic items. (You'll 
recognize them by their 
black and white labels that 

practically scream out 
GREEN BEANS or GRAPE 
JELLY.) You sacrifice an 
enticing picture of the con-
tents, but you save 10 to 50 
percent, and they are just 
as nutritious. 

Manufactured generic 
goods, such as cooking oil 
and paper towels (there's 
even generic beer) , may be 
slightly lower in quality than 
store or name brands. For 
instance, a tissue may be 
three-fourths of an inch nar-
rower, but who blows his 
nose at the end of a tissue? 
BYOB- BE YOUR OWN 
BUTCHER. By playing sam-
urai chef. you can trim 
meat costs by as much as $2 
a pound. A good , inexpen-
sive knife can transform a 
whole cut of meat (a blade 
chuck roast, for example) 
into several meals' worth of 
steaks and cubes. 

(Hint: Sometimes the 
same type of meat at an-
other area ofthe meatcoun-
ter is cheaper, simply be-
cause it's cut differently .) 
TRY ALTERNATE PRO-
TEIN SOURCES. Dairy prod-
ucts , chicken , and fish are 
obvious beef substitutes . 
Other foods rich in protein 
and usually cheaper than 
beef include ground meats 
blended with soy protein, 
offbeat kinds of fish such as 
pollack and monkfish , and 
tofu, a versatile ' soybean 
product. 

Plant proteins such as 
lentils , lima beans , and 
chickpeas may banish your 
meat cravings forever . But 
because they lack certain 
amino acids, they are in-
complete proteins and must 
be complemented with grains 
or dairy products. 

For more information 
on high-protein meatless 
meals, read Recipes for a 
Small Planet by Ellen Buch-
man Ewald (Ballantine 
Books, New York, N.Y. 1975,

To Buy 
Or Not 10 Buy 
Perhaps you 've seen it hap-
pen . Maybe you 've actually 
been a victim. Just as you're 
eyeing a set of car tires at 
Fred's Tire Emporium, a 
stock boy , trigger-happy with 
the price-tag gun, rushes 
in and slaps on a new, higher 
price. Or maybe you were 
thinking of buying a few 
new albums until the list 
price climbed a dollar. 

It's enough to persuade 
anyone that it's better to 
buy now than pay more later. 

Such logic doesn 't al-
ways hold true, according 
to Donald Moffitt, former 
personal-finance columnist 
for The Wall Street Journal . 

Let's say you 'll be tour-
ing Europe next summer, 
and you 'd like to take along 
a good 35mm camera. Should 
you buy it now or wait? 

" I don 't think it would 
make much sense to buy it 
now," Moffitt says. "It's by 
no means a certainty that 
prices will be much higher a 
year from now. In fact , in-
flation is slowing down. 

"In the meantime, to 
buy something you don 't need 
now means you lose the in-
terest that the money might 
otherwise be earning, or 
you 'll deprive yourself of 
something you need right 
away. A very good rule of 
thumb is don 't layout cash 
until you have to."

Throwaway 
Textboo~s 
How would you like to pay 
less than $10 per term for all 
of your textbooks? A West-
wood, Massachusetts, pub-
lisher has come up with dis-
posable textbooks (called 
"paperbooks") that usually 
cost less th.m $1 each. 

"Paperbooks are text-
books published in tabloid-
newspaper form," says Ray 
Moloney, president of Pa-
perBook Press. "Five or 
more textbook pages can be 
printed on one page, so a $6 
textbook becomes an 85 cent 
paperbook. 

"We publish mostly sub-
jects in the humanities and 
social sciences, but not the 
hard sciences," he explains. 
"Most students keep those 
texts for future reference ." 

Colleges and universi-
ties in all 50 states and nine 
foreign countries use paper-
books, according to Moloney, 
who adds , "Even Harvard 
uses them." 

Have you ever found 
yourself in a similiar sit-
uation? If so, you may have 
fallen prey to a business's 
most effective salesman: 
retail psychology. 

"Retail psychol-
ogy's purpose is to 
motivate people to 
buy something they 
had no intentIOn of 
buying," says Mau-
rice Winn, an Indi-
anapolis manufac-
turer, distributor, 

and fonner retailer. 
"It's very effec-

tive. " 
How dOes it work? Here 

are a few examples: 
ATMOSPHERE. Clothing 

stores geared to the young 
know that blaring rock and 
disco throughout the store 
can be extremely effective. 

And just as music can alter 
your buying mood, so can 
color and atmosphere. Winn 
notes that one local luggage 
store displays exotic travel 
posters from around the 
world. "You go in wanting a 
canvas bag, but you buy a 
leather one. The decor makes 
you feel more sophisticated. " 

SlORE LAYOUT. Items 
often bought on impulse are 
strategically placed where 
shopper traffic is heavy. 
(That's why the cosmetic 
counter is usually in the 
center of a depaJ1Jnmt store.) 

DISPLAYS. "It's a con-
stant battle for suppliers to 
get their products displayed 
in the ' most conspicuous 
areas of the stores," Winn 
explains. High-profit items 
are placed conveniently at 
eye level. 

PRICING. Four-for-a-dol-
lar cans of tomato paste 
displayed in a bin are no 
bargain if they're priced at 
25 cents a can on the shelf! 

"With a few simple strategies, you can save at least 10 to 15 
percent on everything from tuna fish to cameras," says Dr. 
Heinz Biesdorf, a "supershopper" at home and a consumer 
economist at Cornell University. 

For example, when most people want a stereo, they go 
out one night to one or two stores and then come back with 
one for $500," Biesdorf explains. 

For his stereo, bought at two-thirds the list price, 
Biesdorf did two weeks of research. "I read stereo 
magazines, wrote to stereo discounters, and compared 
ratings in Consumer Reports. I found one I liked, then 
shopped locally and looked in catalogs for the best buy." 

Careful planning and spending applies to small pur-
chases as well. "Consumers often ignore, for example , the 
10 to 15 percent savings iri buying the cheaper can of tuna , 
but over time, this adds up," Biesdorf says. 

Remember 
When? 
Alas, when it comes to most 
prices, the good old days 
(1970, that is) were really 
the cheap old days. Below 
are now-and-then cost com-
parisons of a few popular 
products. (Prices may vary 
according to region .) 

ITEM 1970 1980 

Record album 
(list price) $5.98 $8.98 
McDonald's 
fries , cheese-
burger, and 
shake .70 1.54 
Coca-Cola 
(10-ounce 
bottle) .15 .30 
Hershey bar .10 .25 

Whew! Inflation can 't 
get much worse than that. 
Or can it? To show "what 
can happen if our inflation-
ary trends continue," Man-
plan Consultants, a Chicago 
firm , has projected selected 
prices for 1989. A sampling: 
lower-priced car ($17,400) , 
small loaf of bread ($7.73), 
box of ce real ($13.30) , col-
lege tuition ($12,800 for pri-
vate, $1 ,350 for state) . 

Take heart. Even with 
inflation, the prices of a few 
items have ac tu ally de-
creased since 1970. Among 
them are contact lenses. 
pocket calculators, sewing 
machines. radios, digital 
watches. TVs, and stereos.

SHOPPING SMART 

Health 
Wealth 
Along with cafeteria food , 
university health centers are 
a favorite target for student 
complaints. The solution to 
catastrophic cafeteria con-
coctions is simple: Eat out. 
But what if the health cen-
ter doesn't provide a serv-
ice or you simply want an 
alternative? 

For preventive care, 
county health departments 
may offer free testing and 
other services such as im-
munization shots and VD 
treatment. 

And for reproductive-
health services , Planned 
Parenthood offers a full 
range, from contraceptive 
care to counseling. Fees are 
determined on a sliding scale 
(depending on income) , and 
no one is denied services for 
lack of money. Consult the 
telephone directory for the 
clinic nearest you . 

CHOOSING A DOCTOR. 
For emergencies and 

sudden' illness, you need a 
doctor who knows your med-
ical history . "But choosing 
a doctor can be a shot in the 
dark," says Chicago physi-
cian Sandra Gadson. Ask 
friends and teachers to rec-
ommend local physicians. 

Dr. Gagson also sug-
gests compariSon-shop-
ping- asking prospective 
physicians about billing pro-
cedures, routine office-visit 
costs, lab fees , and credit 
policies. 

DRIUlNG DOWN DENTAL 
COSTS. 

You can cut down on 
dental expenses by visiting 
university clinics staffed by 
dental students. Since the 
dentists-to-be are closely su-
pervised by their professors, 
treatment is usually slow 
but thorough . 

Retail dentistry is an-
other alternative. Growing 
numbers of department 
stores (like Montgomery 
Ward and Sears) offer in-
store dental services. Fees 
range fmm 30 to 50 percent 
less than those charged by 
private practitioners. 

SAVING AT THE DRUG-
STORE. 

"Ask your doctor to pre-
scribe generic equivalents 
if they're available," advises 
Glenn E. Freiberger, a Mad-
ison , Indiana , pharmacist, 
"or ask your pharmacist to 
substitute generic products 
for brand-name items." The 
savings might have curative 
powers of their own. 

The same holds true for 
nonprescription drugs. "Look 
at the ingredients listed on 
the label, " Freiberger ad-
vises. "Many store brands 
contain the same things as 
brand names, but they cost 
much less." He notes that 
highly advertised aspirin 
brands like St. Joseph and 
Bayer are no more effective 
than generic aspirin- but 
they may cost twice as much . 

A Sale for 
All Seasons 
Even in limes of uncer-tainty, there's one thing you can count on: white 
sales in January. 

Rest assured, stores con-tinue to hold tradition-al seasonal sales year 
after year. But, as the eco-
nomy fluctuates , they ' re 
breaking from tradition a 
bit and holding them more 
frequently . 

For the first time last year, stores held pre-Christmas sales, and 
this year bathing suits went 
on sale before July 4, reports 
Midge Shubow, director of 
consumer information at the 
White House Office of Con-
sumer Affairs. 

For a calendar of sea-sonal sales, we've listed a few from Sylvia Por-
ter's New Money Book for 
the 'Ills (Doubleday, Garden 
City , N.Y., 1980, $24.95) . As 
the economy changes, how-
ever, the list won't always 
hold true. Shu bow advises 
comparison-shopping and 
checking newspaper ads.

Buy With a Little Help From Your Friends 
Uncle Sam has made it easier for stu-
dents to "cooperate"-and to save money. 

Since the recent opening of the Na-
tional Consumer Co-op Bank, you can get 
federal loans to establish cooperatives-
nonprofit, consumer-owned and operated 
businesses that offer low prices for food , 
housing, and such services as health 
care and auto repair. 

For example, a co-op that buys food 
wholesale may offer discounts as high 

8 INSIDER 

as 33 percent, according to Stewart 
Kohl , executive director of the North 
American Students of Cooperation. 

NASCO publishes the Campus Co-
op Directory ($1), which lists over 400

Bottom-Line 
Bal\lainin~ 

Although Madison Avenue 
may not advertise the fact , 
the joys of bargaining ex-
tend beyond the boundaries 
of the open-air market. 

A few retail possibili-
ties come to mind immedi-
ately . Stereo stores, auto 
dealers, mechanics, contrac-
tors , house painters, and 
garage-sale entrepreneurs 
often expect customers to 
bid down prices. You have 
nothing to lose by offering a 
lower price. 

Even store department 
managers may knock a few 
dollars off floor samples or 
slightly damaged goods, so 
just ask. The gap between 
your cost and their cost may 
leave room for negotiation .

Loob Before

Beware of "fluff. " That's a 
warning to cost-conscious 
apartment-hunters. 

"Cosmetic appeal" can 
be deceiving, says Esther 
Patt, counselor for the Cham-
paign-Urbana Tenant Union 
at the University of Illinois. 
"Some students will rent a 
place which is not structur-
ally sound but has luxuries 
like a dishwasher," she ex-
plains. "They should con-
sider whether these are 
worth the cost they add to 
the rent. " 

A few other guidelines

Fifteen men and women 
share the work and worry 
as dwellers in a housing 
cooperative near the Uni-
versity of Texas at Austin 
called the Nexus. 

A single room in their 
spacious house (fronted by 
a white picket fence and 
boasting a flower and vege-
table garden) cost $140 a 
month last year, including 
meals. But cooperators, so 
to speak , also must share 
the cleaning, cooking, and 
shopping. 

"We're very independent 
people," comments five-year 
resident David Craig. "But 
we do enjoy having an en-

than one or two, you can 
save on food and utilities , 
but you don't always save 
on rent. Some landlords, 
especially in university 
areas, charge per person. 
(The same dwelling may 
cost $200 for two renters , 
$300 for three.) 
Check utility costs. 
" Utilities included" leases 
are not always cheaper. 
Compare prices. If you must 
pay utilities, ask to see past 
bills. Ooo't trust vague es-
timates. 
Consider hidden expenses. 
Is the place furnished ? Will 
you have to take a bus to 
class? Is parking extra ? 
Study the lease, 
Who's responsible for re-
pairs? Can you sublet? Terms 
in the lease may often be 

ergetic social atmosphere." 
Occasionally, members go 
canoeing or throw parties 
together. 

The co~p was started 
in 1973 by then-UT student 
Mike McHone, who bought 
the house. "I had an inter-
est in starting a co-op, and I

the landlord promises to pay 
for new carpeting, get it in 
writing! 
Deposits you can bank on. 
You will have to pay a se-
curity deposit, usually one 
month 's rent. To get it all 
back when the lease expires, 
make a list of the apart-
ment's defects when you 
first move in. Have the land-
lord sign it, and give him a 
copy when he checks the 
damages. 

Laws on deposits, dam-
ages, and leases vary. Know-
ing them can save you mon-
ey . (For example, some 
states require interest to be 
paid on deposits .) Consult a 
tenant union, legal service, 
or consumer group for more 
information .

"Nimrod Palace" may not 
be palatial , but it is profit-
able. The ll-bedroom house 
in Champaign , Illinois, is 
owned and leased by Uni-
versity of Illinois senior 
Mark Woodard. 

Woodard bought the 
house in 1978, assuming a 
$50,000 mortgage. "But it is 
possible to buy a house with 
a relatively small invest-
ment," he says. "One of my 
friends did this with only 
$2 ,000 up front. 

"The rent I'm collect-
ing (from 11 tenants) cov-
ers the house payments, in-
surance, taxes, utilities, and 
garbage service." Last year, 
it was also enough to pay for 
Woodard's room and board 
at his fraternity house. 

Not counting major re-
pairs , Woodard says he 
spends about two to three 
hours a week working at the 
house. 

He gives this advice to 
prospective home-buyers in 
college towns: "Lookaround 
and find a deal you can get 
into cheap. The location of 
the house is important. If 
it's close to campus, it keeps 
the place full ."

While most businesses which 
sell to students are legiti-

few "scam" organizations 
that swoop down on college 
campuses looking for easy 
prey. Unfortunately. they 
often find it.

couldn 't boil a pot of water.

Whats Up With Warranties? 
The next time one of your household

When the avenues for com-

a dead end. don 't get mad. 
Get even. 

And one of the best le-
gal ways is through sma ll-
claims courts where costs 
are low (usually less than 
$25) . and the odds favor 
spurned consumers. 

Eighty to 90 percent of 

the plaintiffs win at least 
part of what they sued for . 
And experts say the psycho-
logical benefits of formal

Since smalJ.claims courts

contending parties present

J ane Rosenberg . general 
cou nsel for the ew York

percent of successful claims 
go uncollected in ew York." 

Although you can com-
mi sion a sheriff' s deputy 
to collect claims. you mu t

If you have trouble getting a

Avoiding 
Satanic 
Mechanics 
Car repair- it looms over 
student pocketbooks like a 
pecter waiting to strike. 

But cost is not always 
as important as quality when 
choosing a mechanic, says 
Stan Hathcock of the Auto-
motive Service Council in 
Atlanta . "The lowest esti-
mate seldom repre ent the 
highest-quality work." 

Though not always an 
easy ta k. finding a com-
petent mechanic should be 
a top priority. Hathcock ad-
vi es checking with local 
consumer agencies or ask-
ing friend for recommen-
dations . 

Once you've made a 
choice , get a written repair 
estimate (including parts, 
labor. and tax) . Tell the 
mechanic that if actual re-
pair costs exceed the esti-
mate by more than $10, you 
are to be notified before any 
additiona l work is done. 

Beware of vague. un-
itemized estimates that say 
" fix engine" or " repair 
ca r." Be ure you under-
stand your warranty cover-
age before repair are 
started , and ask to ee old 
parts after repair are made.

Campus Cash 
With one fell swoop, you can make money, cut costs, and 
perhaps even get better grades. How ? By getting an on-
campus job. 

Not only will it eliminate transportation costs, but an 
on-campus job "tends to be more flexible regarding a 
student's academic needs, " says Vince Roig, coordinator 
of student employment at Arizona State University . 

"We find that students who work on campus tend to 
persist in school and do better academically ," notes 
Clantha McCurdy, a financial aid director at the Universi-
ty of Kansas at Lawrence. On-campus employees tend to 
feel closer to their school and less discouraged by its 
academic and social challenges, McCurdy adds.

Problem: Your wallet's so 
empty you can't buy a beer, 
but your schedule's so full 
you can't hold a part-time 
job. 

Solution: Create a spare-
time job. The procedure's 
rather like forming a mini-
business but there's more 
flexibility because you de-
termine your own hours. 

The key is zeroing in on 
your talents and skills, then 
cross-checking them with 
local demand (or creating 
the demand yourself) . 

Don 't overlook your col-
lege education . Make it pay 
off ahead of schedule. The 
class proj ects you nursed 
along in Horticulture 101 
could reap quick cash if 
you sell them to flower and 
plant lovers. 

Even if you don 't want 
to sell your skill , or the 
products thereof, you might 
try teaching it. Inquire with 
university extension or non-
credit programs. 

Consider the Demand. 
Check the Yellow Pages and 
want ads to see what's in 
demand and what's not in 

supply. If no one in town 
offers an errand-running 
service, start one yourself. 

Or, take a less formal 
approach. Do you have a 
car? That probably places 
you in the minority on cam-
pus. Offer a shuttle service 
ca rting stranded students 
to and fro . 

Don't Underestimate 
Yourself. You say you have 
no skills and nothing you 
could do would ever be in 
demand? Can you take notes? 
Richard Byrnes, a gradu-
ate of Syracuse University , 
served as a surrogate stu-
dent last year, taking notes 
for students unable to attend 
class. 

Do you have blood? The 
local medical center may 
pay you for plasma. Can 
you sleep? The National In-
stitutes of Hea lth have spon-
sored research projects at 
local medical centers which 
paid participants to sleep. 

And. of course, the psy-
chology department is al-
ways a good place to check 
for notices announcing a 
search for right-handers who 
write like left-handers or 
anyone else willing to spend 
some time and fatten his 
wallet in the interest of ex-
perimental science .

She began her unoffi-

her freshman year at Tus-

It's a true rags-to-riches sto-

Northwestern University stu-

In their sophomore year, 
Allen Wasserman (left) and 
Jeff Schwartz launched a 
small-time operation spo-
radically selling T-shirts to 

dorm dwellers. By senior 
year, however, " for every 
10 shirts you would see, I 
guarantee we did nine of 
them, and probably 10," 
says Wasserman . 

Profits from the busi-
ness allowed the pair to vis-

market, and ... graduate 
several thousand dollars 
richer last June.

And if the situation might 
be the least bit questionable, 
she brings a friend . 

Concerning the unusual 
nature of her business, she 
explains, "I didn 't want to 
do anything boring." 

ferred to UAB and began 
working in the biostatistics 
department, she offered not 
only to provide information 
for theses and dissertations, 
but to type them as well . 

Word-{)f-mouth advertis-
ing increased business so 
much that Henderson opened 
a full -time typing service 
after graduating. (Services 
have expanded to include 
printing as weI!.) " It 's a

As for the time needed 
to run the business, "it was 
very, very minimal ," he 
notes. "At most, five hours 
a week. 

"We were successful be-
cause we had a business 
sense and people liked deal-
ing with us," Wasserman

head, their business could

Get-Ahead 
Exams 
Time is money , and when 
you're in college, it seems 
the meter is always run-
ning. 

Heavy courseloads and 
"early out" programs (com-
pleting four years of study 
in three years) are two ways 
to cut costs and save time. 
Another method worth con-
sidering is credit by exam, 
offered through two nation-
wide programs. 
CLEP. 

The College Level Ex-
amination Program offers 
52 exams (usually multiple-
choice) the third week of 
every month at more than 
900 locations across the coun-
try . The first test costs $22 , 
and each exam thereafter is 
$18. Individual schools de-
termine how much credit 
you 'll get after passing the 
tests- often three to six cred-

OVER $1'1 BILLION 
IN FINANCIAL AID 

EXISTED,I 

Times are tough for Sandra 
Axtell and her family, but 
she 's grateful for every 
minute of it. 

Axtell , who 's divorced 
and has two children, grad-
uated from high school 12 
years ago and is now going 
to college. And she has gov-
ernment grants and a work-
study program to thank. 

"I was 30 years old and 
didn't have any skills," she 
says . "I knew I had to get a 
better education to get a 
higher-paying job." 

At first, Axtell "had no 
idea" that money was avail-
able to pay her · family 's 

living expenses while she 
went to school. Only after 
other students urged her to 
see her school's financial 
aid director did she discov-
er government and private 
programs designed to help 
the college-bound, regard-
less of age. 

The transition from work-
ing wife to full -time para-
legal-assistance student at 
Tarrant County Junior Col-
lege (TCJC) hasn ' t been 
easy. A Basic Educational

Dependinq On 
Independence 

Alive and 
Weiland 
Living 
On Your 
Own 
By declaring financial in-
dependence , you may find 
your elf eligible for heftier 
government financial aid. 
The evaluation of need is 
then based on your income 
and assets, instead of your 
parents '. 

Proving independence 
involves meeting at least 
three requirements : 1) that 
you haven 't lived with your 
parents for more than six 
weeks in either one of the 
last two years; 2) that you 
haven 't received more than 
$750 in support from your 
parents in either one of the 
last two years ; and 3) that 
you haven 't been listed as a 
dependent on your parents' 
income tax returns during 
the past two years . (Be pre-
pared to prove your claim 
with tax returns and other 
documentation . ) 

In some instances, your 
campus financial aid offi-
cer may waive some inde-
pendent-status requirements.

utilities for Axtell and her 
children . 

" With $6,000 to last me 
through this year, I have to 
budget everything ," she 
says. But Axtell doesn't re-
gret her decision . " My chil-
dren respect me more, and 
I'm not afraid to engage in 
conversations about nation-
al issues." 

What advice does Ax-
tell have for men and wom-
en thinking about returning 
to or beginning college? 
"Don 't worry about financial 
problems. It' s not easy, but 
you just have to go ahead , 
even if youth ink you can 't. "

LIVING 
ON LESS 

Guerrilla 
Attac~s on the Retail Mar~et 

When conventional means 
(read : money) of feeding , 
clothing, and entertaining 
yourself run short, it's time 
for guerrilla tactics. 

First, parents and near-
by relatives commonly pro-
vide the best kind of meals-
free ones. Just remember 
to sound weak and frail when 
you call to say hello . 

Or hit the bars at happy 
hour for free popcorn , hors 
d'oeuvres , or cheap hot dogs 
and burgers. Sunday after-
noon or Monday night foot-
ball usually bring forth such 
barroom largess. Ifthe qual-
ity is suspect, have a few 
happy-hour-priced drinks. 
Then you won 't care what 
you eat. 

For higher-class dining, 
be a restaurant critic for 
the school or local papers. 
This can wangle a free meal 
if you promise to withhold 
your notes from the board 
of health. 

Flea markets and yard 
sales, especially in wealthy 
suburbs, regularly feature 
clothes , furnishings , and 
sporting goods for sale at 
remarkably low prices. Do 
the folks a favor; they prob-
ably have dozens of tennis 
rackets, tuxedos, and other 
goodies chJt:t.ering their closets. 

Why pay someone $15-
plus at a styling salon to 
make a noise with the scis-

sors? 'fry having your hair 
cut , styled, or permed at the 
local school of beauty or 
barber college. (The latter 
is especially recommended 
if you aspire to be a re-
cruitment-poster look-alike.) 

or course, mankind can-
not live by food and fashion 
alone. Travel and entertain-
ment help. 

For long-distance travel , 
ride exchange boards are 
the tried-and-true method. 
Just be sure you don't hitch 
up with a freewheeling ma-
niac. Uyou have a Caribbean 
cruise in mind, some travel 
agencies offer a free spot 
for the organizer of groups 
of 15 or more. (This may 
apply to other package deals 
as well, such as a white-
water rafting trip .) 

Free theater, concerts , 
recitals, exhibits, and tours 
abound in university towns. 
But if there's an $8 theater 
performance you don 't want 
to miss, strike up acquaint-
ances with the cast or crew. 
They may ask you to sit in 
on a dress rehearsal. Or, if 
your knowledge of films is 
so expansive you can name 
the director of The Attack of 
the Killer Tomatoes, try 
your hand at reviewing. 

The possibilities are end-
less. All it takes is an empty 
pocket, a little inspiration, 
and lots of chutzpah. 

Economics of Less 

Carter Henderson. author 
and lecturer on the future 
of business, former London 
Bureau Chief and a front-
page editor of The Wall 
Street Journal. 

Q: What is meant by the 
term "economics of less"? 

A: BasicallY,astheU.S. 
economy bumps up against 
structural limits to mate-
rial growth, such as disap-
pearing petroleum resources, 
we are going to have to live 
with less material goods. 

As a result, we must 
learn to do more for our-
selves, turn our homes from 
citadels of consumption to 
places where things are lov-
ingly produced , such as 
horne-baked bread and home-
grown vegetables. 

We must also learn how 
to tap into the productive 
strength of our communi-
ties, from food cooperatives 
to credit unions , to create 
(in some cases) our own 
income-producing jobs, and 
to recognize that for many 
things that are vital to our 
happiness, there are no lim-
its to growth- flirtation , 
romance, conversation, phys-
ical fitness , worship , the list 
is endless . 

Emer~ency 
Funds 
Last night in the library 
your bio texts were stolen . 
You can 't afford new ones 
until your paycheck comes ... 
and that's after the mid-
term. Should you cheat? 
Steal someone else's books? 

It might be wiser to seek 
an emergency loan . Many 
schools offer them, at little 
or no interest, to students 
beset by temporary finan-
cial problems. Ask your fi-
nancial aid officer about 
them.

"Whenever or wherever , 
go , my eyes are always 
peeled for thrift stores or 
junky little shops," says Sue 
Crichton , a recent Univer-
sity of Tennessee graduate. 

Crichton and her friend , 
Greg Crone, also a recent 
UT graduate, have each 
been shopping at thrift mar-
kets since high school. 

"At first , ) went out of 
curiosity ," Crone says . 
"Then) started finding real-
ly good buys." He mentions 
buys like 75 cents to a dollar 
for cotton, button-down shirts 
and a dollar or two for pants. 

And Crichton stocks her 
closet regularly with shirts 
for less than a dollar, wool 
tweed blazers for less than 
$2, or winter coats for $4 
each. 

"I usually go once a 
week on the way to work," 
says Crone. "You should hit 
the stores as frequently as 

most of these clothes five or 
six years ago , and they hold 
up better than my newer 
things," she adds. 

After Crichton and Crone 
peruse the clothing, they 
turn to the kitchenware and 
small furnishings and find 
the prices just as agreeable 
as those for the thrift store 
hirts on their backs.

Home Free! 
How would you like to live 
rent -free (or close to it ) 
while going to school ? 

House-sitting, especial-
ly during summer months 
when many profes ors take 
extended vacations, is one 
.free housing alternative. 'n 
exchange for supervision 
duties, many dorms offer 
room and board to resident 
assistants. Being a live-in 
babysitter or housekeeper 
are other po sibilities. 
. For the more imagina-

bYe home-seeker, those aren't 
the only ways to be happily 
(and cheaply) housed . A 
funeral home in Evanston 
Illinois, provides a student 
with living quarters in ex-
change for answering the 
telephone at night and oc-
casionally acting as the 
home 's representative at 
wakes. 

If living with the dead 
isn't your idea of fun in the 
sun , consider Bill Schultz, 
an electrical engineering 
student at the University of 
Tennessee . For a reduced 
rate, he lives in Ur's ex-
perimental solar house , 
watching dials and conduct-
ing tours three days a week. 

And for those who like it 
rea lly hot , there' the itha-
ca Volunteer Fire Depart-
ment. More than 20 Ithaca 
College and Cornell Univer-
sity males receive free hous-
ing in the firehouse in re-
turn for battling blazes, says 
Deputy Chief Ken Reeves. 
"The fire chief who just 
retired stayed here when he 
was going to school. "

Dear Mat and Tat in the crib Weinglass 
continued from page 2 

The Cornell ian also tells 
me that the students in the 
College of Agri culture, 
especially animal husbandry 
majors, take the fewest 
showers. They showeroncea 
semester, whether or not 
they need it. Maybe that is 
why their school song is: 

High above Cayuga's waters 
There 's an awful smell 
Some say it's Cayuga's 
waters 
But we ,know it's Cornell. 
After an hour-and· a-half 

wait, I finally got to use the 
shower. Unfortunately there 
was no talcum powder in the 
lavabo, so I had to ask the 

hostess where she kept it. I 
walked downstairs and what 
did I see in the living room? 
The guests were rolling 
dollar bills and sucking the 
talcum powder up their 
noses. How clean can you get? 

I left the party after that 
bizarre sight. That was the 
last straw. I'm transferring 
to Yale, where the only thing 
they ~ut up their noses is 
their fingers.

It is a shame I don 't fit in

starting to understand the 
lingo. The list of California 
words I sent you in the last

Here is some more Califese: 
Real/y- Californians 

respond to everything with 
"really." "Really" is nothing 
more than an affirmation, 
telling the speaker that the 
listener knew the person was 
speaki ng. but did not 
necessarily hear what he 
said. One California student 
can sob to another, "The 
workload is enormous. I can't 
take it any longer. I can't 
handle the pressure! It's 
killing me!!!" The response is 
always, "Really." 

Punching in for some rack 
time - Going to sleep, or 
taking a short nap. 
Californians will more 

frequently refer to sleep as 
"catching some ZZZZ's." 

&iii - "Let's bail" means 
"let's leave." 

Driving the big white bus-
Grabbing the toilet seat with 
both hands, leaning over and 
vomiting. One "drives the big 
white bus" after drinking one 
six-pack too many. It is also 
referred to as "praying to the 
porcelain god." 

It is getting late. It is time 
for me to catch a few ZZZ·s. 

Send Money. 
Love.

Day Garson's medium is 
Polaroid photography. She 
manipulates the exposed

and colors. With special tools, 
she produces altered

CHICAGO AP - Too 
little sex might contribute to 
prostate cancer, a disease 
that kills nearly 22,000 men 
each year in the United 
S t a tes som e researchers 
theorize. 

The theory was developed 
by Dr. I.D, Rotkin of the 
Preventive Medi~ine Depart-
ment of the University of 
Illinois. He said there is 
speculation - but not 
confirmed scientific evidence 
- that a connection exists 
between a buildup of male 
hormones and cancer of the 
male prostate gland. 

Rotkin said he and his 
colleague found a pattern of 
lifelong sexual repression ina 
study of 430 prostate cancer 
victims who were compared 
with an equal number of men 
without cancer. 

The researchers found that 
while the cancer victims had 
a greater than normal sexual 

urge, they actually engaged 
in less activity less than the 
men who didn 't have cancer. 

Rotkin 's theory was 
supported by the work of Dr. 
Ri chard Ablin of Cook 
County Hospital's Hektoen 
Institute. 

At a recent international 
sympo ium in London, Ablin 
reported that semen reduces 
the prostate's natural ability 
to fight disea e by 16 to 80 
percent. 

Ablin based his findingon a 
tudy of white blood cell and 

tissue from 25 Cook County 
Hospital patients.

Voyager 1 
Saturn pix 

PASADENA, Calif. AP 
- Voyager 1, hurtling away 
from Saturn at more than 
33,600 mph, transmitted 
more pictures yesterday of 
the planet's baffling rings 
and scientists said they 
hoped the additional data will 
shed light on the formation of 
the solar system. 

Voyager was more than 3.1 
million miles beyond Saturn, 
on its way out of the solar 
system. 

Jeffery Cuzzi, a member of 
the Voyager photographic 
team, told reporters at theJet 
Propulsion Laboratory that 
Saturn's rings provide an 
opportunity to study the 
behavior of broad, disc-
shaped structures in orbit 
around a large body. 

Such a disc is believed to 
have circled the primordial 
sun more than 4.6 billion 
years ago and evolved into 
the planets now making up 
the solar system, he said. 

Slide at 
Yosemite 

YOSEMITE NATION-
AL PARK, Calif. AP -
Boulders the size of pickup 
trucks crashed down on 
weekend hikers on the 
hairpin turns of a trail near 
Yosemite Falls, killing three 
and injuring seven, park 
officials said. 

The rock slide, onto the 4.8 
mile trail about a half-mile 
below the top of the famed 
2,700·foot waterfall, left a 
"big blank pace" on the face 
of the mountain, said Mary 
Nile , librarian at Yosemite 
National Park. Debri wa 
scattered over a 6OO-yard 
section of the tortuou trail. 

About two dozen hiker 
were on the trail when the 
slide rumbled down Sunday, 
said Linda Abbott, aNational 
Parks Service spokeswoman. 

Hiker John Weis said he 
and a companion took refuge 
under an overhang and were 
protected from "rocks the 
size of RV (recreational 
vehicles). "
