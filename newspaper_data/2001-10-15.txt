A.S. works 
with LGBTA 
for Safe Zone 
Council seeks way to 
make gay studen ts 
more comfortable 
By DANIEL WATTS 
Contributing Writer 

The A.S. Council is JOining with 
UCSD's alternative lifestyle organizations 
to create a program to make students lead-
ing alternative lifestyles feel more comfort-
able on campus. 

A.S. President Jeff Dodge, in conjunc-
tion with Lesbian Gay Bisexual 
Transgender Resource Office Director Sean 
Travers and Lesbian Gay Bisexual 
Transgender Association principal member 
Brian Latham, proposed bringing the "Safe 
Zone" program to campus. The program, 
which would draw upon $4,000 of A.S. 
Council funds, originated at Texas A&M, 
where Travers previously worked. 

Latham was a resident advisor last year. 
He said that his job made him realize the 
need for such a program. 

"I know there's a demand for it on cam-
pus," he said. 

There are two ways in which Safe Zone 
might work. 

In one scenario, departments would pro-
vide sensitivity training for their faculty. 
The training is designed to increase staff

Students lend helping hand in Tijuana 
Fraternity and sorority members complete houses for needy 
By GEOFF DlmlCH 
Associate News Editor 

More than 100 members of 
UCSD's Greek organizations 
traveled Oct. 13 to Lomas del 
Valle , one of Tijuana's most 
decrepit shantytowns, to help fm-
ish 26 homes started two weeks 
ago by other San Diego volun-
teers. They worked with Project 
Mercy, a nonprofit humanitarian 
organization. 

"This is for a good reason," 
said Kate Mossbarger of Kappa 
Alpha Theta. "It's not for me; it's 
for other people. I've never been 
to Mexico to paint houses 
before." 

In Lomas del Valle, the meal 
and the house mean a lot to the 
500 families who live on this dirty 
hillside . Though the town is 
located only miles from UCSD, it 
may as well be light yea rs away. 

"They are humans, they 
deserve respect an4 a better qual -
ity of life," said Panhellenic 
Director of Philanthropy Annie 
Abbott. "That is why we are 
here." 

The students' goals were to 
help the impoverished residents 
of Lomas del Valle and to bring 
UCSD's fraternities and sororities 
closer together. 

"The real reason [of the trip) is 
to help out the families in 

Mexico," said Randy Takalci of 
Sigma Alpha Mu. "A better rea-
son would be to strengthen the 
Greek system as a whole." 

After traveling southeast in 
Mexico for nearly 40 minutes, the 
buses pulled up to the base of the 
hi ll on which the shantytown sits. 
The students became more 
somber as they realized that 
Greek needs would take a back 
seat to those of the residents of 
Lomas del Valle. 

It took just one step off the bus 
to realize the conditions these 
people live in. Students saw the 
squalor on the ground, smelled 
the stench of muck, heard the 
squealing barks of rotten dogs, 
tasted the muggy air, and felt the 
experience of poverty. That was 
all before catching a glimpse of 
residents' faces. 

"It's easy to become cynical 
and give up on humanity. But we 
can't give up - other people sti ll 
need our help," said Abbott, who 
is also a member of Kappa Alpha 
Theta. 

For the next five hours, the 
students painted homes, laid roof-
ing, moved furniture and did 
other odd jobs intended to turn 
the simple shelters into homes. 

A coat of paint seemed futi le to 
many when they considered the 
surroundings.

Marshall council passes resolution unanimously 
By MARGARET O'NEILL 
News Editor 

T he Thurgood Marshall 
College Student Council passed a 
resolution condemning content of 
the most recent issue of The Koala 
at its Oct. II meeting. 

Student Affirmative Action 
Committee Representative Isaac 
Pearlman authored and introduced 
the resolution, which states that 
TMCSC "upholds the UCSD 
Principles of Community which 
'affirm the right to freedom of 
expression,' while also 'affirming 
each individual's right to dignity. '" 

The editor of The Koala, George 
Liddle, said that he believes that 
The Koala has not offensively por-
trayed any groups in the publica-

INSIDE ... 

tion. 
The council slightly amended 

the resolution before it was passed. 
Pearlman introduced the resolu-
tion in an e-mail earl ier in the 
week so that members could 
review it, according TMCSC 
Chair Adam Sharki. 

The counci l passed the resolu-
tion 20-0. 

"Everybody was very much for 
this," Sharlci said. 

In the resolution, the council 
"strongly urges the members of Tbe 
Koala to make retributions to all 
ethnic communities they have 
offensively portrayed in its issue by 
either volunteering for community 
service helping those specific eth-
nicities they have slandered, donat-

Liddle said The Koala won't be 
meeting the resolution 's requests. 

"Tbe Koakl has no plans in the 
foreseeable future to do any volun-
teer community service or make a 
public apology," Liddle said. 

Sharki sa id that TMCSC is "all 
for freedom of expression and free-

that "there's too much tolerance of 
intolerance."

TMCSC: 
Council calls for apology 
from The Koala 
Continued from page 1 

College counci ls and the A.S. 
Council have received complaints 
about Thr Koala . TMCSC was the 
first council to pass a resolution 
against the publication. 

"ThiS type of attack is offensive to 
u~ a~ individuals and as representa-
nve~ to our college, which prides 
Itself on its diversity and has incorpo-
ra ted It a, a major pan of our chool's 
philosophy," the resolution states. 
"Diversity of race and ethnicity are 
cri ti cal components of any modern 
society and the abu e or degenera-
tion of anyone person's heritage is an 
affront to all of us." 

Sharki said that the oUler councils 
on campus are considering similar 
actions. I-Ie said that figuring out 
what actiOn to take was difficult for 
hiS council. 

"I t was a matter of trying to figure 
out what we can do," Sharki sa id . 

The resolution was passed in 
response to com plaints brought by 
numcrous groups and individuals. 

"\Ve recognize the com plaints 
from the members of the Srudent 
Affirmative Action Committee ... 
[co11lpla11lts from] the president of 
the Union oiJewlsh rudents and the 
preSident of Alpha Ep don PI as 
valid, and condemn an)' promulga-
tion of neg'IO\'C ethl11c stcreotypes, 
racI.tl slurs and any other typc of 
IIbults to people's hcnrage," the res-
olution states. 

Sharki feel s that some SOrt of 
action was ncce~sary to help srudents 
feel s.lfe. 

"A lor of people don't sce it as 
h11l11or. A lot of people find it offen-
sive and it tears apart the fabric of 
our community," Sharki said . 
"People were feeling uncomfortable. 
It hit people on a very personal 
leve\." . 

LIddle thinks that Tht Koo/o did 
not overstep any boundarie . 

"We have freedom of the press in 
this country and this is what it 
entails, it allows people to do sruff 
like this," Liddle said. 

I Ie said he is not angry at 
TMCSC for the resolution. 

"Everyone is entitled to hi s own 
opinion," Liddle said.

that a university that prides itself on 
diversity should not stand by and 
watch while slanderous things are 
being printed, according to SAAC 
Chairman Ernesto Martinez. 

"The atmosphere I get is 'I'm 
just one srudent, I feel powerless, ... 
Martinez said. "Or people read it 
and they think, 'Wow, 'that's really 
terrible,' and then they go on with 
their lives." 

The goal of the presentation, 
according to Martinez, was "pri-
marily to raise awareness within 
the A.S. [Council] and the UCSD 
community that these things aren't 
funny." 

SAAC hopes that the anti-hate 
resolution passed by the A.S. 

rion tells you that 
U1CY can't do anything." 

SAAC also wantcd to addre 's 
the college council chairs and urge

MONDAY, OCTOBER 15, 2001 THE UCSD O'UARDIAN OPINION 4 

[II hen Peter Jennings speaks does your home fall $ilent like the aisles 
in a church service? In the wake of 

the tragedy that has befallen America, I com-
mend anyone who is payi ng more attention 
to the news now. 

But how much of the news disseminated 
by the media accurately portrays real-life 
events? It is our civic duty to observe the 
news we are presented and to be critical of 
the information that is pumped into our liv-
ing rooms. 

T he te levision has demonstrated an 
unprecedented reach into our homes, busi -
nesses and even our bedrooms with millions 
tuning In dai ly. 

This saruration can lead news media to 
present ideas as if they are "common sense" 
and should be unquestionably accepted. I 
suggest that Americans filter the headlines 
closely and scrutinize each news story with a 
careful eye, rejecting this notion of "common 
sense" because even when tragedy is on our ' 
doorstop, the media is still in the business to 
make a buck. 

The talking heads tell us with furrowed 
brows tha t America has reason to fear a new 
threat: biological warfare. The death of a 
photo editor at American Media, a division of 

The Sun newspaper, after inhaling anthrax, 
has spawned a new panic among American 
citizens and the media have done nothing to 

_ assuage unwarranted hysteria. 
And why should they? Due to the con-

tinuous coverage of the terrorist attacks by 
all three of the major networks, a lot of 
advertising revenue was lost. If the net-
works can pull us back in after the immedi-
ate threat has passed, by constantly intro-
ducing new ones, then that is exactly what 
we can expect them to do. They need to 
recover their losses from the Sept. 11 
attacks. 

This isn ' t to say that the threat of biolog-
ical assault is a figment of news executives' 
imagination. It is only an assertion that their 
coverage of the anthrax threat, which usually 
includes pictures of men donning airtight 
space suit protection and gas masks with 
huge circular eye shields, is sensational at 
worst and incomplete at best. 

What they aren 't telling us is the opti-
mistic outlook of germ and chemical 
weapons. For an actual gauge of the threat, 
Americans must do a little homework. 

Anthrax, which is now in the spotlight, is 
caused by a readily available pathogen that 
can be found in infected livestock and soil. It

does not have to be obtained from a secret 
laboratory by scientists with special haz-
ardous material licenses. Therefore, if Osama 
bin Laden or any other terrorist organization 
wanted it they probably already have it and 
have for years. 

It is a deadly infection, but treatable when 
found early. It is difficult to spread and even 
more difficult to contract, even after expo-
sure. Simply touching the anthrax spores or 
even breathing them in does not precipitate 
sudden death. 

The media have conveniently under-
played the fact that even though the three 
anthrax victims, besides the one who died, 
had spores in their nasal passages they are 
currently doing well . I had to flip all the way 
to page 20 of the Los Angties Times Oct. 12 
issue to find a mere two-inch article stating, 
"Third Anthrax Victim Is Back at Work." 

Within that article, the Times reported 
that the victim said, "I just want everyone to 
know that I'm fine," as she smiled and head-
ed back to work. Of course, we didn't find 
this article on the front page because calming 
the masses doesn 't make for good headlines 
(or good business). 

Similarly, it isn't popularly addressed that 
no connection has been made between the 

terrorist attacks and the outbreak of anthrax 
on the East Coast. The FBI is investigating 
the incidents as criminal acts, but no solid 
conclusions can be drawn tying the tragedy 
in New York and Washington D.C. to the 
discovery of anthrax exposures or the isolat-
ed anthrax death. 

Obviously, the likelihood that the two 
events are connected is worthy of investiga-
tion, but when the newspapers publish sto-
ries about anthrax under their "U.S. Strikes 
Back" headline, they are conducting blatant-
ly interpretive news reporting and most 
readers are unaware of that. The papers do 
not allow readers to form their own conclu-
sions, but instead present the occurrences 
inextricably as one. 

So do we need to run, not walk, to our 
nearest Army surplus store? Well, if you do, 
news cameras will surely follow you in. They 
will snap pictures as you pull your chemical 
suits off the shelf, your gas mask from the 
rack and throw bottled water into your cart. 
Congratulations! You have just created more 
news. 

As Americans are already on edge, we are 
susceptible to being frightened into doing

Editor: 
I was disgusted and appalled by 

Bertrand Fan's column in the 
Sept. 24 issue of the GUllrdilln. It 
showed not only a lack of compas-
SIOn for all of us who have been so 
profoundly affected by the recent 
tragedies, but it also showed a lack 
of understanding of basic human 
emotions. 

While I agree that it was sad 
that there were so many flags dis-
played in the week following the 
terrorist attacks, it is not for the 
same reasons that Fan thought so. I 
think it is sad that it took the deaths 
of thousands of people for us to 

realize just how great our country is 
and to have the pride to express 
that. I think it is sad that we had to 
go our and buy flags because we 
should have had them already. Now 
I only hope that this pride in our 
country does not fade as the shock 
of these horrid events begins to 
wear off. 

I also think that it is sad that 
F an does not understand that 
there is so much more to the flags 
than pride in this great country. 
People are displaying their flags 
to feel a sense of community. 
Seeing people with flags lets us all 
know that there are others out 
there who feel our pain; it lets us 
know that we're not alone in this 
time of suffering, but that we are 
part of a group. 

As to the comments about 
Americans spending so much 
money on Rags when the money 
could have gone to the Red Cross, 
r have a question for Fan: How 
many times have you spent money 
on things like meals out, magazines 
or brand-name clothing when you 
could have donated that money to a 
good ca use? 

I could be wrong, but I bet you 
never have. Not that I am any less 
guilty of these offenses. I'm just 
trying to point our that people 
spend lots of money on things that 
are much less important than 
American flags , but Fan is not 
putting these people down. 
Purchasing and displaying flags is 
part of the healing process that 
most of us are going through and 
it's sad that Fan is condemning us 
for that. 

Even more unfortunate than 
this hypocrisy is Fan 's statement 
that he is not a "poser" because 
he did not give blood or donate 
money. Doing anything you can, 
great or small , to help in a time 
like this is not being a "poser," it's 

being a compassionate person. I 
would like to commend the many 
people who have ignored what 
people like Fan think and fol-
lowed their hearts. If we were all 
"posers" who gave our time, our 
money and ourselves on a daily 
basis to help those who need it, 
this world would be a much better 
place. 

I feel that it's sad that Fan does 
not understand and feel patriotism 
during this time in our lives. I also 
feel that it's a shame that he cannot 
understand the sense of community 
and pride that displaying the 
American flag gives to so many of 
us .

I am going to do something that 
will probably make me unpopular 
in the eyes of many students; I'll do 
it anyway because it is what I truly 
believe. I'm going to take The 
KiNliII's side regarding the allegedly 
racist comments printed in its 
September issue. 

I justify this because I do not 
truly believe that The KOllill hates 
Jewish people, Asians or any other 
group on campus. I'm quite sure, 
with a population of this size, that 
there are individuals among us 
who harbor irrational hatred 
toward various groups. We all 
have a low-key resentment of the 
regents and the local administra-
tion, but I cannot believe that any 
group or organization holds true 
hatred or enmity for any other 
group here. 

People need to grow thicker 
skin and let small slights and com-
ments of this sort slide. I'm tired of 
people jumping up and crying 

"racist" and "hate crime" over small 
things like this . Anyone reading 
this has my explicit permission to 
call me a bigoted honkie or a racist 
cracker. Why' Because of an old 
adage that ends, "but words will 
never hurt me." 

Kristallnacht was hatred. The 
Japanese internment camps of 
World War U were hatred. A three-
line comment about a fictitious fra-
ternity is not hatred. 

I believe that we already have a 
hate-free campus. Day after day, 
month after month, we get along 
with each other. We hate finals , 
lengthy writing assignments and an 
overload of work, but not each 
other. We've had tense situations 
on campus before, but at no time 
since I arrived here in 1996 did vio-
lence break out or did anything get 
damaged. 

People will argue about times 
when things have appeared in the 
middle of the night or items have 
gone missing. To that I can only 
answer that it doesn't happen often, 
and not to a single group over and 
over. Those incidents are probably 
not the workings of a single group. 
Furthermore, if the only hatred we 
have on campus rests in the minds 
of individuals, then the only solu-
tion is a form of thought policing. I 
don 't think anyone is comfllrtable 
with that. 

Are The KOIIiII's comments in 
bad taste? Of course! The KoIIiII is 
nothing but bad taste from cover to 
cover - that's why we read and 
enjoy it every month. 

The KOIIIII should not be 
praised for its latest issue (aside 
from the general "good job, you 
printed another one and made us 
laugh"), but neither should it be 
punished .

not essential to the rest of the sen-
tence.) Not laughing anymore, are 
you' 

Well , maybe you are. I would 
be. But as pathetic as this job may 
seem, it was surprisingly hard to 
get. 

It was about this time last year 
that 1 applied at the GuardIan for 
my more-pathetic-than-words-or-
n onesse n ti a 1- ph ra ses-ca n -
describe job. I went in, filled out 
an application and went on my 
merry way, assu red of the fact that 
I was way toO much of a journal-
ism geek to be turned down . 

I was wrong. 
I should note here that, as a 

freshman trying to get used to a 
new school and sense of indepen-
dence, I did not really want a job. 
By thiS I mean that I was ba~ically 
just !'fally lazy. My mother made 
me apply. So I was hardly heartbro-
ken when I was summari ly to ld that 
the Gum'dian no longer needed any 
more copy readers. 

Then, at the very end of winter 
quarter, I ran into one of tbe copy 
readers who was I/ot rl!)ected. She 
mentioned that tbi paper was 
looking to hire readers again, and, 
because I iust love rCJection, I 
decided to reappl y. 

The second time I applied, I 
was actually rewarded with an 
interview. Jennifer posito and 
Jeffrey \Vhite, who are now the 
upinion editor Jnd editor in chief, 
rc"pectively, were the LOpy editors 
then . And quite intllllidating peo-
ple they were! 

But they were ,lls() cr ucl, heart-
less people because they sched-
uled my interview for three days 
after I had my wi sdo m teeth 
pulled out. I rea li ze they had no 
way of knowing this , but dammit, 
it's hard to interview without all 
your teeth. 

So I showed lip to my meeting 
with a swollen face, missing teeth 
and a head fu ll of Vicodin . I was a 
happy ca mper, let me tell you. 

The interview started our with 
tough, hard-hitting questions like, 
"What college are you in?" and 
"What is your major?" I, of course, 
took several moments to contem-
plate the fuzzy colors dancing 
before my Vicodin-c1ouded eyes 
before answering each question. I 
am great with first impressions . 

Then we got to the really hard 
stuff - copy reader stuff.

conduct through federally imple-
mented stipulations. The rules see 
to it that broadcast and radiO sta-
tions and newspapers mainta1l1 a 
level of professionalism and 
integrity in the production uf our 
news. 

However, these regulatory bod-
ies can only control the industry to 
a certain extent. While they can 
ensure that the news stations will 
nor tell outright lies for their own 
capitalist gain, they cannot oversee 
how sensa tionalized a story is to 
increase the network 's buttom line, 
if the details are correct. The 
American people must make this 
analysis. 

Anthrax, like nuclear war and 
terrorism, is an imperative topic 
that deserves careful cumidera-
tion by the media and the 
American people. 

But as the TV rations antI 
newspapers relentlessly deliver 
images that mayor may not repre-
sent the whole truth, we shou ld be 
extremely careful nut to unqUt: -
tioningly accept every story. The 
news industry has a bu lI1ess to 
run, and we help them to CJ jllt,JI-
ize at our expense if we watch with 
uur eyes wide shut. 

'then'?" i\\y response: "y\'ell one

I know the differencc." And I stili 
ay that when under heavy med -

ication, none of you would hJve 
been able to do any bener. You 
probably can 't anyway. 

That portion of the inrervlcw 
over, I was then told that I would 
need to take the "copy test." Yuu 
could almost tasle the olllinuu 
undertone in that phrase - and 
with Vicodin, you rea lly can. 

The only problem with thiS 
plan was that there were no aVJil-
able computers. I may have been 
high at the timc, but I knew even 
then that thi s was not what I 
would cal l a "highly efficient, 
well -o il ed machine" of a newspa -
per if they couldn't even give me a 
computer for an hour. 

As scary as It soundcd at the 
rime, the copy test turned out to 
just be an article with a lot of 
inserted mistakes that I was sup-
posed to catch in the span of one 
hour. 0 biggy. After all , I am a 
journalism nerd. 'This was cake. 

About 20 minutes latcr I wen I to 
find whatever copy editor caught 
my eye. I told Jeff I was donc, full 
of pride in myself for doing wcll 
and not falling asleep un the key-
board (again). 

Jeff's responsc: "You're dOlle ' 
Are you sure'" 

Looking back on it 1l0W, th:1t 
sounded a lot like Regi~ Philbin', 
patcnrcd , "Is that your 1'111011 
answer?" 0 of course I wa" I/otllt 
all sure that I was really done with 
the copy test - wha t the hcll was 
[ thinking? 

I staggered back to the comput-
er nod S,lt in front of it for 15 morc

(in Vicodin . After tha t, I reallr lild 
feci sure that I W'I" done - 'or ,It

I have never sccn that copy tc"t 
since, bur I am fairly sure I did well 
because I was hired. 

J elUlY has since c1ai mcd that she 
"lost" my first application, and that 
could be truel.. but [ still like to 
make her feel guilty aboll t it on

of help made it even more reward-

"It's nice £0 do hands-on work. 
It is a whole 10[ bener than just 
raising money." Mossbarger said. 

Miller shared simi lar feelings . 
"h's always differem when you 

are doing philanthropy in a place 
like La Jolla because you aren't 
really sure what your money is 
doing." Miller said. "So this gave 
myself and my fraternity brothers 
a better perspective of what needs 
to and can be done." 

Many talked of returning soon 
with more people to help. 

"You can't just come here once 
and not want [0 come back 
and help again." 
said David Cohen. 8 member of 

Pi Kappa Alpha. "We are dedicat-
ed to doing more than p:riming 
houses. This is just the begin-
ning." 

Cohen sa id that he plans to 
return with medicine and other 
supplies. 

"1 think the biggest thing was 
not necessarily the painting of the 
houses. which was a nice thing to 
do." said Sam Shah. a member of 
Pi Kappa Alpha. "The main thlllg 
is that everyone who has gone on

HNO HDIU SCHHID YOU 
SHOULD HI 

o 

A panic seems to have spread through the 
United States in the past few weeks. 
Americans are wondering if we are at a high 
risk of a biological or chemical warfare and if 
such an attack could effectively be conducted 
against the Uni ted States. 

Fears of an attack intensified last week 
after Robert Stevens died from inhaling 
anthrax in Florida. While the circum tances 
surrounding his death are till unclear. many 
fear it is a harbinger of biological warfare as 
a new form of combat. The scare is remini -
cent of other attacks in which chemicals were 
used as weapons. 

For example. in 1995. terrorist group 
Aum Shinrikyo spread aerosols of anthrax 
and botulism in Tol..-yo on eight occasions. 
Most of these attempts were only marginally 
successful. killing a total of 12 people. In 
1979. 64 people died of an accidental release 
of weaponized anthrax in Sverdlovsk. Russia . 

Other possible biological agentS include 
smallpox. cholera and plague. 

An outbreak of smallpox would be "devas-
tating." according to Gerard Spahm. director 
of occupational health at the Salk Institute. 

"It would be horrendous. But we have 
every indication that there is no other small -
pox." Spahm said in an interview OCt. II. 

While small amounts of smallpox still 
exist in laboratories in the United States and 
Russia. it was declared eradicated in 1977. 

Of the biological and chemical agents that 
could be used in an attack. anthrax seems to 
be on most peopte's minds. 

There are three types of anthrax in fec-
r tion: inhalation anthrax. cutaneous anthrax 

and gastrointestinal anthrax. 
Cutaneous anthrax is the most common 

form . with about 2.000 cases reported 
annually and a 20 percent death rate. 
according to the Center for Civi li an 
Biodefense Studies. 

FBI officials and Rudy Giuliani. mayor of 
New York. spoke Oct. 12 in a press confer-
ence about the NBC employee who has been 
diagnosed with cutaneous anthrax. 

"There is nothing that ties it firm and 
hard to the Sept. 11 events." Barry Mawn of 
the FBI said. 

However. Dr. Brian]. Murray. director of 
Student Health Services at UCSD. is skepti -
cal. 

"Cutaneous anthrax is fairly uncommon." 
Murray said. "I would say the relation 

between the NBC woman and ter-
rorist activities is highly sus-
pect." 

The cutaneous form of 
anthrax is usually trans-
mitted by infected ani-
ma �s. which places wool 
sorters at industrial mills 
at the highest risk. 

Gastrointestinal 
anthrax is less common 
since it is spread by ea t-

ing undercooked. contam-
inated meat. 

The strain of most con-
cern is inhalation anthrax. When 

distributed as an aerosol. it is an odorl ess 
and sightless enemy. and can travel many 
miles before spreading. Inhaling ai rborne 
spores causes infection. but it is not conta -
gious. 

Once the spores grow. the disease fol -
lows in two steps. The first stage shows 
symptoms of fever. cough. headache. vom-
iting. chest pain and weakness. T he second 
stage is red-flagged by a sudden fever and 
shock. 

~ 
IHUIlN6IUHIT~ ~ 

From the time that the first 
symptoms appear. most victi ms 
last from 24 hours to three days 
without medical treatment. 
However. many victims do not 
show symptoms for a long time. 
But if a victim is treated wi th 
antibiotics such as Cipro at the

Senior Staff Writer 

I f you're one of those people 
II'ho ha ever ,aid, "I think I'm 
gOIng (() take the LSAT iust to see 
ho\\ I lI'ollld do," I have this to say 
111 response: Don't even toy with 
Ihe Idea of law school unless you 
have hundreds of dollars to throw 
around. 

;-";ow, when I mention dollars, 
you probably dunk I'm referring 
(() Ihe dstronomical tuition fees. 
J,socl3rcd II'lth mosr of the top-
lIer law schools. I larvard, Yale and 
r,lIlford all demand something 

Jround $1 5,000 per year. Even the 
lower-ranked, bur still noteworthy 
schools - such as USC, Cornell 
and Columbia - will cost you a 
prerty penny. Still , the steep 
rlllrion is expected. 

\ \'hat you might not expect 
from law school is JUSt how much 
II cou ld COst you to simply take the 
le,t Jnd apply. Let me en lighten 
you, dear prospective LSAT-tak-
ers, wllh a few II1slghtful bits of 
wisdom that consurute the sum of 
,III I learned while studyi ng for the 
Big Test over rhe last three 
months. 

II m,ts $96 to register for rhe 
I.St\' I: On top of rh,l(, most test-
t'lker~ register for the "Basic Law 
School Dara Assembly Service 12-
month subscri ption fee" for $95 . 
T he 95 buys you one free score 
report and ensures that your let-

ter~ of recommendation will be on 
tIle With the LSDAS. It already 
sounds like an expensive proposi-
t;on . 

The average applicant applies 
to ' I 0 law schools. You get to pay 
$9 for each addi tional score report 
that the LSDAS sends out. 

After registering to take the 
LSAT and deciding which 10

color covers 

schools you're applying to, you've 
got a bill of $281. 

Let's be fair and imagine that 
you're taking the test just to "see 
how you would do," and that you 
thus have no need for 10 score 
rcportS or for the filing service. 
Being there on test day is sti ll 
going to cost $96 and if you ever 
do apply, you'll sti ll have to regis-
ter for the LSDAS for $95 . 

ow, let's imagine another 
scenario: You paid the $96 JUSt to 
see how you would do, bur now 
that the economy and the world 
seem a tad wobbly, you want to 
apply to your 10 schools and 
ensure your position on the stu-
dent deferment list rarher than 
your position on the front lines 
in Afghanis tan. 

First, you'll be hit by that $95 
fee and then you've got to order 
those additional score repons at 
$9 each. T hen, a month later, 
you' ll forget that you're a commu-
nications or political science major 
and you'll think, "What the heck? 
I might as well apply to Harvard. I 
mean, I do have a 3.90." 

Now you will have gotten your 
little legalistic self into a quandary 
- you only ordered 10 score 
repons' Never fear, of course. 

The LS DAS loves to predict 
your blunders and make moncy 
off them, and rhey predicted this 
one perfectl y. You can order 
additiona l score reports for 
Harvard at a later date, but the 
price goes up from $9 each to 
$11 cach . 

ow that's $95 for the test, $96 
for the LSDAS subscription, $90 
for score reports and $11 for the 
Harvard decision. That adds up to 
$292 . 

And you haven't even paid your 
application fees yet, which run 
between $50 and $70 each. Ten 

applicatioI1s at an average of $60 
per application is $600. The grand 
tOtal has now risen to $892 . 

Oh, and what about those 
preparatory courses you've heard 
such wonderful things about' 
They must be worth something-
I mean, they're the reason the 
LSAT is getting harder every year. 
Well, don't even consider trying 
one unless you've gOt about 
$1,000 to drop. 

New grand total : $1,892 . 
Before I go on, I'll admit that 

the LSDAS does offer fee waivers 
for U.S . citizens. The general 
condition upon which such 
waivers are granted, however, is an 
"absolute inability to pay for the 
LSAT and other essential appli-
cant services." 

That seems sort of reasonable, 
but LSDAS also states that, 
"Because the cost of these services 
is only a fraction of the cost of a 
legal education, the need criterion 
is considerably more stringent 
than for other financial aid 
processes. " 

Here's my reading of that vety 
fish y sta tement: " If you can't 
afford to take the LSAT, you prob-
ably can't afford law school. You 
should be intimidated by these 
looming costs and shouldn't even 
bother applying." 

At first, it seems like I sound a 
lot like the LSDAS booklet. 

But here's how my LSAT phi -
losophy differs: Even if you're 
empty-pocketed, you should save 
up and apply, you should still go if 
you get in, and, of course, you 
should apply for the fee waiver no 
matter what. 

Just be aware of the price tag 
attached to your decision and 
prepare for it. I wasn't and now 
I've got a new $1,300 student 
loan .

MONDAY,OcrOBER 15,2001 

Anthrax: 
UCSD weighs in on 
possibility of attack 
Continued from page 9 

first signs of the disease, anthrax is 
not fatal. 

There is also a vaccine against 
lInthrax, though it is almost exclu-
sively used for the U.S. military and 
its reserves. The vaccine is not rec-
ommended for public use because 
of its harsh side effects, as well as 
the co t and logistics of a large-
scale vacei na tion. 

Authorities also are trying to 
discourage people from creating a 
personal stockpile of antibiotics in 
case of an anthrax arrack . 

Dr. Jeffery Kaplan, the director 
of the Centers for Disease Control 

- and Prevention, said Oct_ 2 that the 
centers "do not recommend that 
physicians prescribe antibiotics at 
this time." 

"We currently have enough 
antibiotics to prevent the disease 
in two million persons exposed to 
anthrax," Kaplan 

for example, over 60 people who 
had an affiliation with the man or 
the company he worked for con-
vinced themselves that they had 
acquired the disease. So far, no one 
there has been diagnosed wi th 
inhalation anthrax. 

Sylvia Wallace, assistant direc-
tor of public affairs at Kaiser 
Permanente in San Diego said, 
"We would encourage people with 
possible complications to come in 
first for the flu vaccination, which 
comes out in the end of October. 
Those without complications 
should wait until ovember and 
December, when supplies trickle in 
to get this year's flu shot." 

Flu shots will also be available at 
the UCSD Student Health Office 
on Oct, 23 for $15 , 

Officials have also reassured a 
public that is unaccustomed to liv-
ing in fear of terrorist activity_ The 
CDC and the World Health 
Organization urge citizens to con-
rinue their normal daily routine. 

Wallace pointed out that the 
government has "stockpile" of 
antibiotics to treat most of the pos-
sible diseases from biological or 

chemical said . "We could 
rapidly get pre-
ventative medicine 
to those who may 

- be affected by the 
dlsc~se, which 
cannOl be trans-
mitted between 
people." 

As nice as thaI 
sounds, this stale-
mcnt has donc lit-
tle to allay people's 
fears. 

"There is no doubt 
in my mind that 
they [terrorists] 

have the capacity to 
unleash a biological 

offensive:' 

pathogens, 
"As a systcm, 

[hospitals] have 
emergency pre-
paredness and 
[practicel simu-
lated drill~," 
Wallace said . 
"We also work in 
cooperation with 
the fire depart-
ment and other 

Muir senior Elijah Zarlin 
said,"There is no doubt in my mind 
that they [terrorists] have the 
capacity to unleash a biological 
offensive. And if it happens, it 
would be devastating, no marrer 
how many precautions you take_" 

While terrorists may have the 
ability to unleash these agents, it 
could be difficult to effectively 
spread il. A successful attack would 
use a confined space to discourage 
dilution into open air. The effec-
tiveness of a chemical attack would 
also depend on location and weath-
er conditions. 

Spahm said that San Diego resi -
dents would not be prime targets 
for a chemical arrack. 

"The prevailing WInds from the 
ocean to the mountains would dis-
perse the particles, therefore dra-
mati~ally r.educing its effective-
ness, he ald. 

Since the primary symptoms of 
inhalation anthrax resemble that 
of influenza, there is a growing 
concern that an increased public 
panic cou ld lead to a psychoso-
matic reaction. That means that 
peoplc could convince themselves 
that they have inhaled anthrax 
spores instead of simply aC'l.uiring 
influenza. 

Following the death in ~rida, 

-Elijah larlin 
MUIr senior 

regional and fed-
eral systems. Many thought health 
care would fold in New York, but 
it didn't fail." 

Most authorities interviewed 
said that there are few practical 
precautions for a biological or 
chemical attack_ 

"In order to be protected, you 
must wear it [a gas mask or air-tight 
suit) 24 hours a day," Spahm said. 

Snldcnt and faculty seem to 
favor continuing a normal routine, 

"I don't take any precautions," 
UCSD employee Katy Pilikova 
said. "I think we have to be wor-
ried, But still, I am going on vaca-
tion."

he pitched . It was just his thing. 
There wa a pitcher at my high 
school that used to write a girl's ini-
tials in the back of the mound 
before each game. He said that it 
inspired rum to pitch better. I told 
him he could do whatever he want-
ed, so long as he kept striking peo-
ple out. I had a friend who had to 
listen to Korn before each football 
game because it pumped him up. 

I must admit that even I have 
my share of silly superstitions and 
rituals. When I used to play base-
ball, I would never let my left foot 
touch the batter's box until my 
right one was firmly dug into 
place. I was even quirkier in bas-
ketball, when I had to take three 
dribbles, spin the ball and then 
take rwo more dribbles before 
every free throw that I took. 

The question seems to be: 
Why do we go through all of this'

serious that I probably would have 
given myself a heart attack had I 
not had a suitable form of release. 

The cheers that all teams have 
for rallies, good plays and inspira-
tional moments are also great 
ways to bring a team together. 
They're just another reminder 
that you are all out there working 
for a common goal. The action of 
cheering as a team during a game 
shows solidariry and reminds you 
that you have supporl. Support. is a 
huge thing for an athlete; it 's 
something you can lean on during 
the rough patches and feed off 
during the good times. 

Thus far, I have only men-
tioned amateur sports, but the e 
traditions continue in the profes-
sional ranks as well. There have 
been many profe sional athletes 
with well -documented supersti-
tions and rituals. 

Retired basketball player Jeff 
Hornacek used to wipe his cheek 
three times with his right hand 
before every free throw that he 
took. This started as a way to subtly 
acknowledge his three children 
during televised game>. As omc 

SPORTS 19 

went on, he kept the routine, saylllg 
that it comforted him on the line. It 
must have worked: lIe retired as 
one of the greatest free throw 
shooters of all time.

Volleyball wins two over the weekend 
20th-ranked Tritons pi~k up victories against SFSU and Sonoma State 

By COURTNEY FIELD 
Contributing Writer 

The UCSD women's volleyball 
team rerurned home this weekend 
after a five-game road trip where it 
beat San Francisco State University 
and Sonoma State University. 

The Tritons, now ranked No. 
20 in Division II , overpowered the 
SFSU Gators. The Gators are now 
0-22 this season. 

UCSD started the match 
strongly and led by as much as 22-
6 in the first game, which the 
Tritons won 30-13. Thirteen out of 
the 17 players on the TritoJl roster 
played in the game and recorded at 
least one lUll. 

Lauren Mills, Ashley Peterson 
and senior co-captain Kathleen 
Hentz led the team with six lUlls 
apiece. Freshman Teresa Ohta, 
who had 14 assists, and junior 
Jessica Barner, who had 19 assists, 
split the time as serrer. 

of Gator Kirsten Ulfig, who had 
seven lcills and nine digs, SFSU 
fought hard and hung tough during 
the second and third games, but the 
Tritons were too much to handle. 

"We needed to communicate 
more because communication is 
key in order to add to the momen-
rum of the game," Gator head 
coach Heather Sisneros said. 

After their substantial win 
Friday night, the Tritons were 
prepared to face California 
Collegiate Athletic Association foe 
Sonoma State University on 
Saturday. Sonoma State, now 6-7 
in the CCAA and 16-8 overall, had 
just notched a crucial win over 
Grand Canyon College on Friday 
night. 

Wilson had 10 digs and ignited the 
Triton team when she served II 
straight points, helping UCSD to a 
commanding 19-9 lead in the sec-
ond game. 

Cossacks Kristen Graham and 
Christine Shiba led Sonoma State 
with 10 kills each. Shiba also had a 
match-high 18 digs, and sener 
Kathleen Gamboa logged 28 
assisq. 

The Cossacks and the Tritons 
battled for possession of the ball, 
but the Tritons were again victori-
ous, winning the match in three 
straight games, 30-20, 30-19 and 
30-19. 

• Triton senior outside hitter and 
co-captain Laura Santerre did not 
start either match this weekend. 

"We have so much depth on 
this team and wanted to experi-
ment with different combinallons 
of players on the floor," said 
Triton head coach Duncan 
McFarland. 

Spike me: Tnton freshman Katie Hogan goes for a slam off an assist from her 
teammate as several opponents go for a block. 

T he Tritons went on to win the 
second and third games, which they 
won '30-22 and 30-14 respectively. 

Behind the tough defensive play 

With a powerful starting line-
up, . UCSD took control of 
Sarurday night's game. Hentz, who 
had an outstanding hitting per-

Women's soccer earns 1-0 victory 
Sophomore Megan Mendoza sparks UCSD offense 
By KlAN TAYRANI 
Contributing Writer 

COl1tilllllng its quest for a third 
straight national championship, 
the UCSD women's soccer team 
beat Western Washington 
University 1-0 at TritOn Soccer 
Stadium Oct. 13 . 

UCSD's only goal was a shot by 
sophomore co-captain 1egan 
.\I endoza, who took a pass from 
so phomore Kristen Conahan, 
dribbled around a defender, and 
hit the right corner of the goal 
with 43 'TIInutes into the second 
half. However, the Tritons clearly 
dominated the contest from the 
sta rr . UCSD took 2J shots to the 
VilUngs ' seven. The loss brought 
the Vikings' record to 5-8-1 over-
all. 

The Tritons won despite losing 
tarrers Jessica Cordova and Kara 

.'vlorriss to injuries. Cordova, a 
se nior forward, ,s expected to play 
in the next game. Morriss , howev-
er, is waiting for the results of her 
recent MRI and is expected to 

remain inactive for approximately 
one month. 

Triton coach Brian McManus 
described his team's playas "scrap-
py." McManus described the 
VilUngs as "good athletes who work 
their backsides off. 

"We've never been a real physi-
cal team," McManus said about the 
Tritons. "We try playing with a lit-
tle too much finesse at times. At 
some point in the game you have to 
stand up for yourself and battle 
back. We have to get a Ii ttle 
stronger physically." 

However, McManus wasn't too 
disa ppointed with the game's low 
score. 

"In the end, the result is what 
you want. I'd rather win 1-0 that 
way than win 5-0 playing badly," he 
said. 

Sophomore goalie Kami Poma 
made seven saves in the game to 
earn her third shutout of the season, 
while her counterpart for the 
Vikings posted nine saves on the

because 
I said so 

O nee again, I have to give ered it to 
the women's volleyball 
team for giving me 
inspiration for my col-
umn. Thank 'You, ladies. 

Heading into Friday night 'S match 
against San Francisco State, I honestly 
had no clue what I wanted to write my 
column about;. It's not like this is anything 
unusual; I usually decide on a topic at the 
last minute. What set this week apart 
from any other was that there was simply 
nothing going on in the sports world. . 

Then, like a sign from the gods, I saw 
the gorgeous women of the volleyball 
team dance on the sidelines of the game. 

Result: instant inspiration. 
At first, I have to admit that I found the 

constant cheers and dances that they were 
doing to be a bit hokey. I've always been an 
athlete who was vety focused on the game. 
For myself, chatting with teammates on 
the bench was acceptable, but dancing and 
cheering after every play was reserved for 
the chesrleaders. However, the more that 
I thought about it, the more I realized that 
I'm just like them. 

In . fact, many athletes behave in the 
same fashion, though maybe not as overtly 
as our beloved women\; volleyball team. 
Routines, riruals, cheers and superstitions 
are an integral a part of the sporting world. 
Take a look at the posterchild for youth 
sports, Little League baseball, and you will 
see a game filled with these things. 

Children wear the same socks for 
wee.ks on end, rum their hats inside out, 
and chant the word "rally" until they are 
blue in the face. The simple act of throw-
ing the ball around the horn after a 
strikeout is another example. 

I remember catching for' a pitcher that 
used to sleep in his cleats the night before
