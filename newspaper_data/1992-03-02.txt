Native Americans 
Decry Sweat Lodge 
By Francisco DeVries 
Staff Writer 

The di pute between Native 
American and students involved 
with a Native American-style sweat 
lodge near the Chi! Cafe is still un-
settled after an emotionally charged 
three-hour meeting Thursday night. 
While both sides praised the 
meeting's open dialogue. there was 
noclearconsensus regarding a!>enle-
ment of the issue. 

Student had been using the sweat 
lodge. an earthen sauna heated by 
pouring water over h t rocks, for 
over two years before Native Ameri-
can Student Alliance (NASA) Chair 
Marilyn Kien leamed of its exist-
ence several weeks ago. The stu-
dents, m . tly members of the Chi! 
Cafe collective. would climb into 
the sweat lodge to sing and chant , 
often while naked. 

The meeting, attended by over 
70 people. included appeals b) Na-
tive Americans who were worried 
about what they see as the degrada-

tion of one of their most sacred 
rituals. 

"To use ou r ceremon ies, no mat-
ter how good the feelings you 
have ... is taking a real. real serious 
chance of unbalancing nature." said 
Ron Christman, of the Viejas In-
dian Reservation near Alpine. 

Gary Whitebear. from the Sioux 
Reservation in uth Dakota. fought 
back tears as he said. "We have one 
very sacred ceremony - the sweat 
lodge. All of our other cerem nie~ 
have been taken away fr m us and 
duplicated. II breaks my heart. it 
makes me want to cry." Whitebear. 
a former U.S. Army Captain. 
pleaded with students to "give us 
our sweat and let it be ours." 

tudents involved with the ~weat 
lodge explained that they did not 
mean to insult Native American!>. 
and only intended to get back in 
touch with nature. "It's not a rel i-
gious thing." ~aid former U SD 
student Bob Bellerue during the

Girlfriend of Accused Killer Fails to Provide Alibi 
• Fonner roommate say Prince boasted of stabbings; 
Texas woman identifies him as La Jolla assailant 

- By Jason Snell 
Senior Staff Writer 

The first week of the preliminary 
hearing in the case of accused erial 
killer Oeophu Prince, Jr. came to 
an end Friday with the beginning of 
testimony by Prince's girlfriend at 
the time of the murders, UCSD stu-
dent Charla Lewis. 

Prince, who is charged with 32 
felonies, including the murder of 
UCSD tudent Janene Marie 
Weinhold, lived with Lewis from 
early 1990 through September of 
that year. All six murders Prince is 
charged with occured during that 
period. 

Lewi " who appeared shaken as 
she took the witness stand, recounted 
being "harassed" by police investi-
gators while she lived with Prince 
in the Buena Vista Gardens apart-
ment complex in Oairemont where 
two of the murders took place. 

"I remembered the homicides 
from the new," Lewi said. "We 
moved after the third [one]. That's 
when the harassment got worse." 

She said that police detectives 
asked her about her class schedule 
at UCSD, and about .any red T-
shirts that may have belonged to 
Prince. Twowitnessesclaimtohave 
seen a man with a dark complexion 

wearing a red T-shirt fleeing the 
murder scene of Michigan high 
school student Holly Tarr. 

Lewis also said she advi ed the 
man he call "Prince" not to give 
blood samples to police. because 
police "said he wasn't a suspect." 

Lewis was then grilled by Assis-
tant District Attonley Rick Clabby 
about her recollection of the days 
when the murders and other crimes 
Prince is charged with took place. 
Lewi was unable to provide Prince 
with an alibi for his location during 
the times of the six murders, most of 
which took place around midday.

UCS8 Aajacts Fee for FooIIJaI Yean, 
Approves $3QuartedyCllmSportsFee 

SANTA BARBARA - A death knell rang Feb. 19 for 
the UC Santa Barbara football team, as student voters 
rejected a $9 quarterly fee for the program wh.ile over-
whelmingly approving a $3 fee for club sports. 

The controversial initiative to save the football program 
failed with 45.9 percent of the vote in the Campuswide 
Winter Election, despite a vigorous campaign by suppon-
ers. More than 6,000 tudents voted in the e lection. 

Athletic Director John Kasser has said that he does not 
plan to restart the expensive program in the future, ac-
knowledging that a " no" vote from students means the end 
of football at UCSB. The Gaucho football team has been 
playing intercollegiate ball since 1986. 

Adam Loew, chairof"Save UCSB Football Oub," said 
he would not comment on the election results until he 
received official word from the election committee, but he 
did raise the po ibility of calling a recount The team's 
initiative received 3,0 9 votes out of 6,733. 

Ron Dolin. a member of the Graduate Student Associa-
tion, which argued against the fee, said the elections were 
unfair. "IThe inititativel was very unfairto include the grad 
students, who have no opportunity to participate," he said. 

"The election procedure is very unfair in that a group of 
students can collect signatures and bypass both the Asso-
ciated Students and the GSA to ti rce thi kind of election," 
he said. 

Dolin pointed out that sin e about 750 grad tudents 
voted in the election, and the football initiative lost by 555 
votes, a strong graduate opposition could have killed the 
fee. 

The results for the club ports program left director 
Judith Dale "delighted," as the fee proposal garnered a 
resounding 4,495 votes, or 69.6 percenL 6.545 students 
voted on the initiative. 

" I'm just delighted for all the kids in club spons and for 
the kids who will beable to get into club spons now," Dale 
said.

PRINCE 
CM'hs ...... ~1 
dercd in dleirhomc on Honors Drive 
in University City. 

Lewis said she filled out • rental 
application rorm thalday for a new 
apartment in Mira Mesa. She said 
Prince had accompanied her there. 

Lewis said she moved into that 
apartment on Sept. 22, 1990. though 
she continued to see Prince regu-
Iarly, as he drove her back and fOM 
between herhome and work in Mira 
Mesa and her classes 'it UCSD. 

The location or Lewis' apan-
mem in Mira Mesa may be a vital 
link in the prosecution's argument. 
since Schultz, the Oark and a 
woman whose home Prince is ac-
cusedofburglarizing were all mem-
bers of a health club in that area. 

Before Lewis took the stand, 
Assistant District Attorney Dan 
Lamborn called Leslie Hughes 
Webb, a university employee from 
Texas. to testify. Webb, who was 
staying in La Jolla during a job rair, 
was attacked on May 2, 1990. 

Webb said that she had been 
sunning herself on the porch of a 
friend's La Jolla beach house. but 
then noticed a man standing at the 
back door of the house, looking 
down the! beach. She said that she 
approached the man, who told her 
that she had stanted him. 

Webb testified that though the 
man pretended to have been some-
one who had rented the beach house, 
he incorrectly repeated the owner's 
name, and quickly left the house. 
Webb went in ide and attempted to 
lock the beach house's door, but 
found that it would not lock. 

"Then he came back," Webb 

said. "He tried to open the door ... 1 
was screaming' No' at the top of my 
lungs." 

Webb says the man rorced the 
dooropen and grabbed her, but says 
she managed to throw the attacker 
off-balance long enough to run out-
side and down the house's step6. 

"I ran out ... but 1 never turned 
my back. never took my eyes off of 
him. "Webb said. "My back scraped 
against the door ... 1 walked half-
way down the steps, and then he 
staned down [toward me)." 

Nearby beachgoers, responding 
to Webb's screams, ran toward the 
house, and the attacker fled. 

When Lamborn med Webb to 
identify the man who had attacked 
her, she pointed at Prince. 

Defense anomey Loren Mandel 
noted that during a police line-up, 
Webbhadreque tedtobearadiffer-
ent man speak. possibly indicating 
that he was not su re that Prince was 
the man who attacked her. 

Thursday's hearing included 
triking testimony from a man who 

lived with Prince for eight months 
beginning in August of 1990. TIle 
man, whose name is being withheld 
from the media at the reque , of 
MunicipalCounJudgePatriciaA.Y. 
Cowen, testified that Prince once 
came home with bloody jeans. He 
also testified that Prince boasted 
about stalking victims and stabbing 
them to death. 

The man is currently being held 
in county jail while awaiting sen-
tencing on a burglary charge and 
requested that his identity be pro-
tected because he has received death 
threats while in jail. While Cowell 
initially ordered that the media not 
show his face or repon his name, a 

The UCSD Guardian 

challenge by attorneys representing 
The So" Diello Ullioll-Tribune 
scaled back Cowen's order to a re-
quest, one that has been followed by 
oll San Diego media. 

Three college-aged women also 
testified Thursday. TIle prosecut ion 
alleges that Prince broke into San 
Diego State University student 
Michele Tait's apartment and stole 
a te levision and VCR. Tait said she 
had been unbathing at her apart-
ment complex's pool at the time. 

Stephanie Jo Squires and Sarah 
Canfield testified about an April, 
1990 incident that occurred while 
they were living in the Torrey Pines 
Village complex near University 
Towne Centre. 

Squires, who said she also had 
lived at Buena Vista Gardens. re-
called that she had been sunbathing 
at the Torrey Pines Village swim-
ming pool when she noticed she 
was silting across from a young 
black man in shons and ,1 T-shirt. 
Afterretuming to herapanment and 
taking a shower, Squires said he 
received a call from the manager of 
her apanmem complex, who re-
poned seeing a man follow her to 
the apartment and go in-ide. 

Canfield testified that three days 
later, while baking a binhday cake. 
she heard someone attempting to 
open her front door. She said that 
upon looking through the peephole, 
she saw a " nervous" man she posi-
tively identified as Prince. 

Lewis' testimony will continue 
when the preliminary hearing re-
sumes this morning. The hearing. 
which will detennine if there is 
enough evidence to hold Prince for 
trial, is expected to last into mid-
March.

the committee acted fairly. "This is

The commillee's recommenda-

providing pamphlets at the TGs. 
displaying slogan advocating re-
sponsible drinking and requiring 
A.S. council members to attend an

a requi rement that A.S. Vice Presi-
dent Mike Holmes criticized. 

"I have reservations about the 
restraints put on the students -
te lling us what to program and 
where to spend our money. Th.u 
should be decided by the students," 
Holmes said. 

Another hurdle for wet TGs 
could be policy decisions made by

Bondurant said he expected the 
police to bring up issues like having 
a "beer garden"-style set up. 

"They're going 10 say ' having a

posed to a beer gurden because it

To Teach or Not to Teach 
Is it possible for 
research and teaching 
to co-exist in peace? 
By Matthew Robinson 
Senior Staff Writer 

In the past few years the 
American public has been 
drown into a delxue. 
Books. pamphlets. 
articles and col WlU1S 
concerned with higher 

education have become 
vel)' popular. The delxues 

mge ceaselessly about the university. its 
mi sion and the atmosphere of ideas it 
encoumges. 

The AmeriCarl public has become aware of 
what economist 'Thomas Sowell calls the 
' 'mornl dry f'O(" at the American wUversity. 
Most reader.; of the opinion \Xlge are familiar 
with "political correctness." What Sowell is 
refening to is 1101 this more exotic aberrJlion. 
but a tendency within academia to be selfish 
and greedy. Selfish and greedy, that is, in 
pursuit of more prestige and bigger names for 
their wUver.;ity and themselves. 

Now higher education wOlts like 
professional sport .... Big names get big money. 
The doctrine is called "publish or perish. " and 
the idea is to challenge professors 10 produce 
wort and ide&<l on a conveyor COI11'rised of 
journals in their respective disciplines.

and students in a tug-of-war. with education on 
one side and the precipice of research on the 
adler. Fonner UC President O;u1( Kerr called 
this new knowledge-generJlingjuggetnaut a 
"multiver.oity"to distinguish it from it 
medieval predecessor. 

Two questions come from this present slate 
of affair.;, What are the gools of the university? 
And for UCSD students, how has this affected 
undergraduate edUC-Jlion'! 

1lle wliver.;ity. nn;t students would agree, 
should attempc to provide an atmosphere of 
ide:ls, for theircommuniC'dtion:md exchange. 
Many believe that the univer.;ity is for job 
tr..uning or experiences: however. the serious 
student realizes dlal there is value in the 
humanities. In other word". something is 
gained by knowing the idea .. and figures dlal 
have shaped the world 

Unfortunately, one notices that this more 
traditional notion of educalion has declined 
and that the humanities and sciences \XlIt

a body of knowledge 1M continues to grow at 
an almost exponential r.JIe. For a univer.;ity 
and professooi to compete, therefore, they 
must push h:ud and relentlessly. 

In liter.llUre. history, phila;ophy and the 
humanities the problem L .. different.. Profes.'iOOi 
become more involved with publishing about 
a more fixed body of'knowledgle. This i~ not 10

Dean o!Graduate Studies and 
Research Richard Attiyeh: I guess I 
wouldn't agree with the extreme char.1c-
terization you described. I think if you 
look around the countl)', there are maybe 
50 institutions out of 2,000-3,000 that 
exist in this country in higher education 
that have a heavy concentration of 
research faculty. I think what's true about 
those institutions is that they are special 
places. That's where the faculty who have 
a research orientation work. 

And the existence of the research 
university ... is one of the great success 
stories in the United States. If you look 
around you, you see that many of_our 
institutions in industry and government 
are in serious trouble. I think that the 
place where you can look and find 
incredible success are in these major 
research universities. 
AIId ..... ....., In tile top 10 ••• 

And this being one of them. Whether 
we're in the top 10 or lOP 20, it's really 
hard to say. But UCSD ranks among the 
better institutions in the country, and we 
expect to continue to do so. 

What that means from the point of 
view of the undergraduate is that you 
have a faculty that is on the forefront of 
research, and that is a great opportunity 
for them. Now, there are some costs 
involved in thaI. One is that if you look at 
liberal arts colleges there you have a 
situation where the faculty are predomi-
nantly teachers. They have a student-
faculty ratio half of what ours is. 1bey're 
like 10-1, we're like 20-1. And the main 
criterion for advancement of those faculty 
is how good they are in undergraduate 
teaching, so they have focused on small 
classes at the lower-division and upper-
division level, and so on. 

Those are wonderful institutions and I 
graduated from one. I musr say, however, 
that it's not clear that overal l you get a 
better education there. There are many 
respects in which they 're better, because 
you have closer contact with faculty, you 
have smaller classes. Those are things we 
really don't have the resources for. But if 
you look at the nature of the curriculum, 
and the level of expectations, if you look. 
at UCSD and compare it to those liberal 
arts colleges, curriculum i probably a 
stronger one. 
...,., 

It is stronger because of the active 
involvement in the underJraduate 
curriculum by this research faculty. This 
faculty is doing the work that's going to 
be in the textbooks 10 or 20 years from 
now. AlsO, I think there is a level of 
elpCCtalion Ihal's hiJher II a result of the

fact that teaching and research are more 
closely integrated. 

So, UCSD is a tough place for students, 
and [think that's good for students. [fyou 
talk to the g.raduates ofUCSD, they're 
proud of the fact that we have a challeng-
ing curriculum and challenging faculty. 
You characterized in your question the 
idea that research and undergraduate 
teaching are competitive. That is, the more 
.you do in one, the less you do in the 
other ... 
you_.Id ......... ? 

By and large, [think they're comple-
mentary. They're complementary in the 
sense that research faculty make beller 
teachers, other things equal. The one sense 
in which they are competitive is that there 
are only 24 hours in the day. And that is, if 
a faculty member is spending a fair 
amount of that time in his lab not teaching, 
those are hours that are, in a sense, taken 
away from undergraduate teaching. 

1bc consequence of that is that we tend 
to have larger classes, and we tend to make 
heavy use of teaching assistants. So, what 
we've done is we've designed an under· 
graduate method of teaching that . . . 
enables us to do the job with less time 
available on the part of the faculty for 
undergraduate teaching ... and, for that 
matter, with a higher student-faculty ratio 
than is true at many primarily teaching 
institutions. 

1be interesting thing is that if you look 
at student opinion IJf in truction here .. . as 
it's expressed in the CAPEs, as opposed to 
letters to the editor in the Guardian. you 
find that there is an appreciation of that 
fact. Most of the faculty receive good 
marks from students - something like 80 
percent wind up recommending the 
teacher ... The good grades apply to the 
large lecture classes as well as the small 
seminarc\asses.

tion euffer? 

In the case where a tudent is respon-
sible for a lecture class .. . that's vel)' 
unusual. That ' s usually an advanced 
graduate student who has virtually 
completed his or her program. And they 
go through careful scrutiny. The next 
year, they're going to be facully at some 
institution probably, so you're not talking 
about someone who is not adequately 
prepared to take on the teaChing. 

It 's not a systematic problem. J don ' t 
think that reflects on the nature of 
instruction genemlly on this campus. 
. .. Any system is going 10 have it 
problem . Which is not to say we 
houldn't try to prevent them. but when 

they occur occasionally it Shouldn't come 
as a great shock to anyone that any large 
program .. . is going to have its difficulties. 

I think. by and large. the (TAl 
workload is quite IOlemble. But, more 
importantly. it's a critical factor in the 
education of tho e' gmduate tudents . 
When they go on and become faculty, the 
fact Ihalthey've had teaching assistant 
experience i extremely important. And I 
think most TAs are outstanding at what 
they do. They ' re under pressure to get 
their gmduate instruction done. finish 
their dissertations and get out of here and 
get a real job. 

But for the most part, I'm impressed by 
how talented and conscientious our T As 
are, and I think most undergmduates. at 
least the Ones I've talked to, appreciate 
their role. I don't think it's true to say that 
too much instruction is off-loaded onto 
the TAs. lthink they play an extremely 
valuable role, and I think the work that 
they do is tolerable.

University policy is such that in the 
personnel evaluations offaculty, recogni-
tion should be given for teaching, research 
and public service. The policy doesn't 
spell out exactly in what proportions those 
should be, and there is a lot of variability. 
Some people do more research than 
others, some do more teaching than 
others. and it varies a lot across the 
disciplines, and so forth. I think attention 
is paid to both, but I think it' true that if a 
junior faculty member is not accomplish-
ing his or her research objectives, tht: 
possibility for promotion is quite low. 

I think that adequate progress in 
research is a necessary condition for 
advancement within the UC system. So, in 
other words, it's not likely that someone 
who is an outstanding teacher but does no 
research will get promoted. 

Now, there is a concern that there are 
people who perhaps do outstanding 
research and maybe aren't very good 
teachers. What happens to them? I think 
in those cases where faculty members are 

"very poor teachers, [ think those people 
have trouble getting promoted, too.

If you look at most departments, the 
number of lower division courses is really 
smaller than the number of faculty you 
have. Typically what the depanment does 
is put those people who are best at 
tcachina those larae ~rses into those

courses. They may be our best researcher~ 
in some cases, they may be our average 
researchers in some cases. I don ' t think 
it's true that by and large the be t reo 
searchers are our least-good low~r 
division teachers. 

I just think that there is a lot of 
variability among the faculty as 10 who'~ 
good at·that particular task. So I think 
there's a tendency to use the faculty when 
they're best. Like in football. not every-
one can play quarterback. You look al lhe 
talents people have and you use them 10 
your best advantage ...

I think currently. and by currently I 
really mean in the last decade. there has 
been a lot of attention paid 10 undergradu-
ate instruction in the University of 
California. We had the Smeltzer Report 
about six years ago .. . which focused 
primarily on lower division instruction. 
And that led to a lot of allention being 
paid on the individual campuses [concern-
ing] how to improve lower division 
instruction, and I think led to a number of 
important changes on the campuses . 
Uk. what? 

I think the most striking are these 
seminar classes offered to freshmen and 
sophomores. Another thing was a signifi. 
cant improvement in the TA training that 
we give. Those are two examples of how 
we 've strengthened lower-division 
instruction over the last ten years. 

In the last couple of year.;, allention has 
been paid to the faculty promotion 
process, and the question is whether 
teaching - good teaching - is ad· 
equately rewarded or not. 

My perception is that most faculty 
think that the existing system that we have 
works reasonably well, but it's probably 
true that more attention should be given to 
evaluating the perfonnance offaculty in 
"their undergraduate teaching function than 
we have given in the past. Recognition of 
good teaching should be emphasized 
perhaps more than it has been .. . closer to 
what the policy actually says, perhaps. 
than has in fact been the case. 

A lot of effort has gone into these 
studies of undergraduate teaching, and I 
think, by and large, the faculty has 
actively participated in a constructive 
fashion. I think it's led to improvement in 
the past, and it probably will again in the 
future. 

This is something that J think has 
occurred from within the faculty . Some· 
times it's triggered by criticism from the 
outside, but I think there are two ways of 
dealing with that. One is 10 pay it lip 
service, and the other is to take it seri-
{)usly, and study the situation, and I think 
that 's what we've done. I think that's an 
indication that we value undergraduate 
teaching as one of our responsibilities. and 
put our money where our mouth is. 
A lot .... to do with the limited 
reeourc •• of the unlvenltJ, 
....'tlt? 

It's a public policy question. Do we as 
a nation or as a state want to give up the 
research university as we 've known it? I 
mean, look at San Diego. The up-and-
coming industry is biotechnology and 
electronics. Where is that located? II ' all 
around (UCSDI. Where would San Diego 
be without that? Where would the future 
of San Diego be without that? We could 
make the UC system like the California 
State University system. but J think we 
would lose something vel)' special. .. 

What we ' re talking about is sort of 
fine-tuning. really. Should faculty be 
putting somewhat more time into under· 
graduate teaching and somewhat less time 
into research? Maybe so. That's some-
thing under debate right now. It will be 
interesting 10 see in three or four year.; 
from now what changes have occurred.

thai we are communing wilh nature," he said 

Some slUdents broke imo tears as they tried to 
explain their intent with the sweat lodge, but Kien 
said she was slill hun by the lodge's existence. She 
said she has been praying and fasting since first 
hearing of iL 

UCSD has already been a painful experience for 
her, Kien said, and dlis has made it worse. "'Ibis is not 
a good ~ lace to be forme right now. Every single day 
I have 10 drag myself out of bed to be on this 
campus," she told the galhering through tears. 

Native American groups offered a compromise, 
saying that they would supervise the rebuilding of 
the sweat lodge in accordance wilh Indian tradition 
if the students would agree to remove the currenlone. 

auisunan made the offer, but cautioned, "I don 'I 
want you to get hun or for you to hurt anyone else. H 
you want to Ieam, learn it the right way." 

SlUdents were enthusiastic about the plan, but by 
the end of the meeting, no details had been worked 
out and il was not cenain if such a plan is feasible. 

Afterthe meeting. Thompson said he was pleased 
with the honest dialogue, but doubtful that anything 
meaningful had been accomplished. "I think that the 
basic contlict has not changed one bit," he said. 

Thompson also said he was wary of the Native 
American requests that the sweat lodge only be used 
in accordance wilh tradit.ion. Such demands, he said, 
could be seen as "the same Ihing as whallhe while 
man has done to [Native Americans)." 

One tribal elder, Henry Rodriguez, was suppon-
iveof the students' efforts, but said he slill felt that the 
sWeBllodge should come down. Rodriguez said thaI 
the students "oughl to be commended for at least 
doing something and not just sitting there. [They I did 
what they thought was righL I have to respect Ihat." 

Most Ole Cafe members indicated they feel the 
lodge should come down to appease the Native 
Americans, but any decision would have to be made 
during Tuesday's CIte Cafe meeting.

Lodge's Creator: 
'Tear It Down' 

TheallJbOversysunoundiogthe~earesweat 
kldge has really bit borne for G.B. Hajim for one 
simple realII - he designed and buill it 

Hajim, a UCSD gmduaIe. designed and built the 
sweat Iodgetwoyears ago. Hestressedlhatbenevcr 
meant flO offend Native American groups. 

In a telepbone CODVersation from his borne in 
An:ata, in NCdbem California. Hajim spate about 
tbeoriginal inrent oftbe swear lodge. "It was pan of 
a whole series of work I was doing using only 
naIW'8l marerials. It was pan of my self~xploration 
and reconocction 10 Ihe eaItb," he said 

Hajim claims that the sweat lodge was, in fact, 
modeledafteraJewisbstar.AsanArabJew,hesays 
he was trying 10 get in touch wilh that pan of 
himself. However, he said he knew of the Native 
American ritual and bad the active support of 
fanner UCSD SbIdent and Navajo Tribe member. 

Hajim said he was very coocemed that every-
one realized the two groups were 00 the same side. 
"II is so imponant for the CIte Cafe to be bonded 
with the Native American struggle," he said. 

Hajim said he fclt it was therefore impol1anlto 
"respect their wishes 10 tear it down. I say send il to 
the breeze .•. if that's what they believe." 

He said this in spite of the fact that he is very 
personally attaIChed flO the lodge. 

"My blood was spiJledon that ground, my sweat 
did go into that groWld there," he said BUI Hajim 
said he never expected the sweat lodge to be a 
pennanent fixture. "'lbere is comtant destruction 
and renewal ... 1 belicve Ihat," he said. 

Hajim said one of the most imponant aspects of 
his life is his contact wilh Nativc American tribes . 
He said that during the time he was working on the 
sweat Iodgc it "was a period in the 0t6 Caf6 when 
almost half of our benefits went to supponing the ... 
Navajo-Hopi struggle for regaining their lands."

Women's 
Tennis Comes 
Up Short 
• Tritons unable to 
beat tough Division I 
Long Beach State 
IyChrtsR ...... 
Associate Sports Editor 

1beUCSDwomen'steruU team 
had a rather rude beginning to their 
weekend as they travelled to Long 
.Beach on Friday and got belted by 
the 4gers, 7-2. 

The Tritons' number one singles 
player, Robyn Inaba, had two set 
poims in the first set against Monica 
Davis before losing it in a tie-breaker. 
Davis went on to take the second set 
6-4. 

Carla Nicolas, the Tritons' num-
ber two singles player, dropped her 
match to Michelle Velli in straight 
sets, ~3. 6-2. 

UCSD's number three singles 
player, Diane Chandler, took Jen-
nifer Sali bury to three set before 
losing 6-4, 3-6, 7-5. 

Head Coach Liz LaPlante said 
Olandler played a "great match," 
but got nervous in the thirdset as she 
was the last match on the courts with 
the home-town Long Beach crowd 
pulling for Salisbury. 

Pauy Y 00 got the be t of the 
Triton • number four singles player, 
Amanda Lynch, 7-5, 64. 

Birdie Ge sford, UCSD's num-
ber five singles player, lost to Jen-
nifer Stoudt. 6-1, 6-1. 

The Tritons' number six singles 
player. Michelle Wilbur, ended the 
Tritons' woes in singles as she won 
her match in three sets against 
Natalie Leles, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2. 

LaPlante credited Wilbur's po- _ 
tent top-spin forehand with helping 
her to pull the match oul. 

In the doubles matches, the Tri-
tons' number-QllC teamoflnabaand 
Nicole House played what LaPlante 
tenned"theirbestmatchoftheyear," 
as they beat the 4gers' combination 
of Davis and Stoudt in three sets, 4-
6,6-3,6-3. 

LaPlante pointed to the agressive 
net play of lnaba and House as a 
major factor in the match. 

Senior Pam Haaf continued to 
recoverfromherinjuryassheteamed 
up with Lynch to make up the Tri-
tons' number two doubles team. 
Haaf and Lynch fell, though. to 
Salisbury and Velli, 6-1, 6-2. 

UCSO's number-three combi-
nation of Chandler and Wilburcame 
up short against Y 00 and Leles, 6-3, 
6-4. 

The Tritons' nex t match is today 
against Western Michigan Univer-
sity at 3 p.m. on the Muir Courts.

However. die UCSD baas were 
on vacation and could I11U5lCr no 
suppon for dleir new pitcher wuil 
the fifth inning. 

n.a·s when Melissa Mazanet 
got 00 base with a iiil, stole second 
and !hen was able to come home on 
SanIh Vaplon 's shot with the Tri-
IOnS' only run. 

The Coyotes Iried to th row 
Mazanct out at the plate. but the 
juniormadc a nice slide to avoid the 
tag. 

The second game started out 
much the same as the firsL 

With Dianna Moreno Ihmwing 
for UCSD. CSUSB scored two runs 

in die ftrSt. 
Moreno stiffened for the rest of 

the game, keeping the Coyotes from 
scoring. buI the dormant Triton of-
fense refused to wake up. 

Despite facing the same pitcher 
who threw the ftrSt game, UCSD 
again t1WIa&ed only one run, this 
time in the second when a throwing 
enor 00 Emily Rubin 's hit allowed 
Lisa Mora to score from second 
base. 

" [Moreno) pitched a good game, 
but we just couldn' t get a hit behind 
her. We couldn' t take advantage of 
the opportunities they gave us." 

'Ole losses dropped the team' s 
record to (K;. 

Moreno stands at 3-3, while 
Mounger is 2-4.

Track MakesStrongShowingin Bakersfield 
.UCSDtumsin 
top performances during 
Saturday's CCAA Relays 
By KenPerImM 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's and women's 
track and field teams ran well Satur-
day in thcCalifomiaCoUegiateAth-
letic Association Relays held at Cal 
State Bakersfield. 

While each relay was run with 
combined teams consisting of run· 
nersfrom UCSD andUC Riverside, 
the Tritons were able to tum in some 
impressive individual performances. 

Eamest Clark paced UCSD in 
the 400 legs of both Ihe distance 

medley and the 4 x 400 relay, with 
Clark turning in times of 49.3 and 
48.2 seconds, respectively. 

Patrick Foy earned equal merit 
for his time of 1:55.3 for SOO meters 
in the distance medley. 

Jason Anderson led the Tritons 
with a 56.1 showing for his team in 
the 4()()..meler hurdles. 

For the women. Erica Washing-
ton sprinted her way to a time of 
59.0 for 400 meters of the 4 x 400 
relay and Denise McFayden led the 
way for UCSD in the 4 x 1,600 
meter relay as she ran her 1.600-
meter leg in 5:06. 

In the field events. the Tritons 
fared jusl as well. In the hammer 
throw. Scott Sargeant took first with 
a 193-1 throw while teammates Paul 
Cogbill and Jeff Taylor took founh 
and fifth respectively. wilh throws 
of 174-3 and 172-8. . 

All three perfonnances exceed 
the qual ifying mark: for the NCAA 
championships to be held at the end 
of May. Unfonunately for the Tri-

ton hurlers. however, Saturday's 
meet came one day too early. None 
of those marks will count for the 
championships, as athletes cannot 
qualify unt il after March I. 

Sargeant went on to win the dis-
cus wi lh a throw of 164- 11 , which 
also exceeded the NCAA qualify-
ing mark. 

Triton teammate Paul Johnson 
took. second place in the pole vault , 
as he cleared the 14-6 mark:, and Ian 
Cooke took sixth in the highjump as 
he cleared 6-71/2 feet. 

Tri ton long jumper Damian 
Coleman took first in the event as he 
soared 22 feet. 

Onthewomen . ·ide.DianeFritz 
flew 17-7 to take first place in the 
long jump event. 

Renee Sprowl grabbed third 
place in the high jump with a 5-3 1/ • 
foot leap. 

Teammate Debbie Hargrove 
equalled the feat as she also turned 
in a third place finish wilh a 139- 11 
throw in the discus.

pI8ce in die IOuI'IIamenI by winning 
the Southern California 
Inlen:oIIcgiate AlhleticConference_ 

The Tritons have faced the 
IGngsmen rwice rhisseason and have 
come away on top both times. The 
first meeting between the two. on 
Dec. 27, was a little closer than 
UCSD might have liked . 

UCSD held off a late CLU rush 
and grabbed a narrow 67-65 win_ 

The Tritons went on to tate a 
more comfortable win at 'Thousand 
Oaks from the J(jngsmen on Jan. 8, 
83-71. 

In what might have been its best 
basketball of the season, UCSD 
managed to shoot a blistering 81 
percent from the noor in the second 
half, while holding Cal Lutheran to 
just 14 of 36. 

At one point, UCSD ran off nine 
unanswered points in just over u 
minute, en route to it 65 point pe-
riod. 

"W~ executed everything we 
did," ~id UCSD Head Coach Tom 

M. V-BALL 
ContInued from ..... 16 
age and seven stuff blocks, accord-
ing to Wilde. 

Wilde also acknowledged 
Lamson Lam 's play. Lam had an 
impressive night offen ively, par-
ticularly hitting from the right side. 

One note of con em for UCSD 
was Nate Brown, who twisted hi 
ankle in the beginning of the second 
game. 

Brent Couture came in for Brown 
in the third game and had a solid 
oUling, according to Wilde. 

BASEBALL 
ContInued from page 16 
next offering, and the Mustang 
catcher3ided UCSD'scause by skip-
ping the ball past O'Sullivan,allow-
ing another Triton run to score. 

Triton lead-offhitterGuy Ollaldo 
picked up three hits and scored four 
time on the afternoon, while David 
Blum chimed in with three hits and 
two runs balled in. 

UCSD's junior southpaw Ryan 
Aanagan went the di tance in game 
one, raising his record to 3-0. 
Aanagan allowed only five hit and 
two runs in hi seven-inning effort. 

Marshall of the game ill the time. 
But MarshIII ~ .... the ~ 

coming playoff pile could bcquile 
different. 

One big problem for the TrilOnS 
will be the absence of Andy 
Swindall, who went down earlier in 
the season wid! a knee injury. 

In both prior meetings between 
the two "Iuads, Swindall was able 
to shut down Cal Lutheran·s 6-6 
po~er man in the middle, Simon 
O'donnell. 

Wid! O'DomeIl out of the way, 
the Tritons were able 10 focus on the 
Kingsmen's lough guard Jeff 
deLaveaga. the nation's top scorer. 

Without Swindall, Marshall as-
serts that ~ attention will have to 
be paid to O'Donnell, leaving 
deLaveaga open as a serious shoot-
ing threat. 

UCSD's advantages lie in its 
guard match-ups. Darvin Jackson 
and Rodney Lusain will provide 
dangerou quickness outside fonlle 
Tritons. 

"That will be a problem for ICaI 
Lutheran] . . . covering our guards," 
said Marshall. "We run prerty well ... 

Wilde said Brown's injury isn't 
seriou and thai he should be rebdy 
to go Mar. 7 when the Triton kick 
offamonth-Ionghomestandagain t 
Ball State, 

Wilde expects a tough match 
from Ball State, which is a top-
twenty Division I squad. 

Playing against a solid Division 
I team could be just what the Triton 
need. as they played their best vol-
leyball of the season against top 
Division I squad earlier in the year. 

"It's just a matter of gelling back 
to how we were against the top 
Division I teams," Wilde said. 

at one poim retiring 14 consecutive 
Mustang baners. 

Yates was concerned about how 
Aanugan's bad back would hold up 
to the stress. but said Flanagan 
showed no signs of pain. 

Triton senior Bryan Thomason 
(2-0) started the second game for 
the Tritons with a rocky two in-
nings. Thomason yielded two runs 
on two hits. four walks. one WI,~ 
pitch, one balk. and one hit bailer. 

Yates pulled Thomason for se-
nior Denny Kubin~ki. who tossed 
four and two-third innings, giving 
up six runs on seven hits and four 
walks.

Marshall also hopes rhat UCSD 
will be able to capil8lize on turn-
overs that come from the 
Kingsmen's mediocre bali-han-
dling. 

Still. Marshall doesn't want to 
appear tooconfldenl. "Nobody likes 
to play a learn d!ree times," he said. 

The Tri&ons" who earned their 
third consecutivQ tournament berth. 
will compere in the G~t Lakes! 
Western bracket. which is arguably 
the toughest of the four brackets in 
the tournament_ . 

The bracket features three of the 
nation's top four teams in the fonn 
ofnumberoneCalvin(MI),number 
three UCSD, and number four 
Wooster (OK). 

The Tritons will take on the win-
nerof the Otterbein-Woosterrruuch-
up, also on Mar. 7.

tion, Calvin will await the winnerof 
the Wittenberg-Hope game :lnd 
Gustavus Adolphus will take on the 
winner of lhe Simpson-Colomdo 
College contest. 

Dan McDcwelvGua'dan 
Nate Brown should recover soon . 

Kurt Luhrsen took the mound in 
the seventh inning and picked up his 
first win by shulling down the Mus-
tang scoring. The Triton hurlers is-
sued 10 walks in game two, while 
striking out only three. 

Leftfielder Steve Wrenn pro-
vided the defen ' ive fireworks dur-
ing game two, with diving gmbs in 
both the second and sixth innings.

THE KEY RGURES FOR UCSD 

Triton Baseball Takes 
Two From Mustangs 
By Ben Elel" 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD baseball team bran-
dished a timely defense and just 
enough offensive prowess to tum 
back The Master's College in both 
ends of Saturday's doubleheader by 
scores of 4-2 and II-S. 

After churning out a meager two 
runsinla: tWednesday 's tieatSouth-
em California College, the veteran 
Triton bats of David Re)t and Ernie 
Isola paced a fired-up offense. 

Rex picked up three hits in the 
first game while driving home two 
of the four runs. 

In game two, the All-American 
first baseman drove hom~ three runs 
on two hits, including a line drive 
home run that cleared the rightfield 
fence. 

both game with four hits in seven 
tries. 

The enior switch-hiller also 
scored th ree Triton runs. 

UCSD head coach Lyle Yates 
was pl~d with hi s rejuvenated 
offense. "lIn game two] we came 
back, came back. came back, and 
never SlOpped," Yates said. "Lru.t 
year. we lIouldn't have seen this 
kind of rellilience." 

With the score tied 8-8 in the 
bottom of the eighth inning, Steve 
Wrenn hammered a double into the 
left-centerfield gap. 

Pinch-hitter Pat Hart then laid 
down a bunt which was fielded by 
the Mu tang pitcher. 1be pitcher 
gunned his throw well over first 
baseman Dan O'Sullivan' out-
stretched glove, scoring the deci-
sive run, 

David Rex led the Triton offense during their sweep ofThe Master's. 

Isola brought home two runs in 
the third inning of game two with a

When you' re in a lump, nothing 
feels bener than to break out of it. 
The UCSD men's volleyball team 
did ju tthat on Saturday as it ended 
its five-game losing treak. with a 15-
13.15-12,15-S victoryoverLaVeme. 

In the fi rst two games the Triton 
got up early and than held offLeop-
ard comeback . 

Head Coach Rod Wilde was 
pleased that UCSD was able to close 
out the first two game as that has 
been one problem area for the Tri -
ton this season. 

"We played fairly steady. We're 
starting to practice a little harder and 
playa little harder," Wilde said. 

In the third game, the Triton led 
early on and never looked back as 
they recorded their second win of the 
year against the Leopards.

couldn't get anything started 
Saturday as they tr.tveled to Di-

"It just wasn't her day." 

Mounger gave up three walks 
and three hits facing her first

When patrons of the Triton Pub entered the campus watering hole, they were greeted with a sign reading, "We aren't your mother." Owner and manager 
Mary Ann Davi explained, '11lere are not a lot of 
no-no' . The kids love to come here to let off 
steam." She made this comment three-and-a-half 
years ago, while announcing that the Triton Pub 
would pennanently close, making way for Round 
Table Pi:u.a ' s Bu llseye Tavern in the Price Center to 
become the only place on campus for tudents to 
buy alcohol. 

Since then, the University Center Board (UCB), 
the Graduate Student As ociation (GSA) and the 
A ociated Students (A.S.) have sought to revive the 
old pub, a plan which calls for the addition of a 
GSA-funded bar. While the renovated pub may 
continue to refuse to be your mother, the GSA's 
truggle to become a competing on-carnpus alcohol 

vendor may leave some wondering if the admini -
tration is playing the part of an Orwellian Big 
Brother. 

Yesterday marked the third anniversary of the 
Triton Pub' last call. When the Price Center, with 
its variety ofre taurant ,opened in April. 1989, the 
University Planning Comminee decided to relocate 
the one on-carnpus pub facility near the re t of the 
dining establishments. After Davis told the univer-
sity that he could not afford to operate a pub in the 
Price Cemer, Round Table was selected as a vendor 
of pizza and beer by an administration, student and 
faculty committee.

How the administration missed the target when 
it replaced the-Triton Pub with the Bullseye Tavern 

traditional 
English pub-

a dariter, quieter 
place than 
Round Table. 

According to 
Daved Fremont, 

1851 year's GSA 
p~ident, his 

council ideally 
wanted to create an entirely 

tudem-run pub. with the GSA acting as the 
licensed vendor. thus assuming liability. "We 
wanted it to be a UCB/GSA venture, analogous to 
the Grove Caffe being a UCB/A.S. vemure." he 
said. 

However, Fremont said that when Assi tant Vice 
Chancellor of Undergraduate Affairs Tom Tucker 
and University Center Director Jim Carruthers were 
approached with the idea of a second campus pub, 
they aid that the right to sell alcohol on campus 
belonged only to the Round Table vendor. 

"Tucker and Carruthers claimed it was com-

" 

understanding" with Round Table that the restaunult 
is the only campus vendor licensed to sell alcohol to 
students. He said that when a vendor of any sort 
submits a bid to the campus. the bid is based on the 
current competition on campus. Thus. he said, 
Round Table submitted its bid with the understand-
ing that the only other alcohol license on campus 
belonged to the Faculty Oub. which holds a "full 
bar" license. 

80dl Carruthers and Vice Chancellor of Under-
graduate Affairs Joseph Watson said that the 
university feels an obligation to keep competition at 
the same level as when the contracts were signed. 

" A contractual relation hip establishes some 
boundaries. To have vendors stumble over them-
selves i not in anyone' be t interest," Carruthers 
said. 

Fremont said that Tucker and Carruthers 
suggested puning a pub in the Cbe Cafe, which 
proved to him that there were holes in Tucker's and 
Carruthers' claim. 

"Their claim all along was that Round Table had 
exclusive rights in the Student Center. The Ch6 is

had exclUSive rights in the Student Center .... 

I could tell that what they said about

pletely impo ible. They said they had a legally 
binding contract with Round Table," Fremont said 

He asserted that this is not so. ''There is abso-
lutely nothing in the Round Table contract that gives 
them exclusive rights, exce", (0 sell in their own 
space ... there is no single-license requirement" 

[considered part of] the Student Center," he pointed 
out. " I could tell that what they said about the one-
license policy was crap." 

BY SHERYl W OlCOTT, SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

"The intention was to lead us astray," he said. 
According to Laura Tedder, currently the GSA 

represeolalive to the UCB Pub Committee, another 
option - which was di liked but may have been 
employed - was to offer the Round Table vendor 
the first right of refusal when the new pub facility 
sought its own vendor. 

However. before any option was chosen, Round 
Table's lease has corne up for re-negotiation this 
month. The administration has been persuaded by. 
according to Watson. the "sound and compelling 
rationale" of the graduate students, to agree to 
negotiate under the terms that there will be a second 
student pub on campus. 

Because there is a law prohibiting any subdivi-
sion of the state from holding a liquor license, 
neither the GSA nor the UCB - both considered 
subdivisions of the Univer;ity of California - will 
be able to aPPly for vendor statu . But, according to 
Tedder, a new pub vendor proposal will be i ued at 
the beginning of April. 

According to ABC Supcrvi ing Investigator 
David Gill, the ABC will grant an alcohol license to 
an on-campus vendor if it i found to have a suitable 
location for the distribution of alcohol and if it 
operates on a sound moral character. Gill said that 
the ABC does not have separate criteria for granting 
licenses on college campuses, but "there are 
concerns that need to be addressed ... because a 
college campus has a big pool of people who are 21 
and under." Gill said that one such concern is 
making sure there is sufficient staff to check 
identifications. 

While the students involved saw the latest 
development as a success, they questioned the 
university's policy of creating what appears to be a 
university-sanctioned monopoly. 

"It seems obvious that the intent is not to gather a 
lot of competitive busines within the Student 
Center," Fremont said. "The number one priority 
[Carruthers] has always had is to protect his [Price 
Center] vendors. I don't see it to anyone's benefit." 

is that their products would not be duplicated," she 
said. "It has to do with power - there's a lot of 
power the university has over the Price Center 
vendors. They are most supportive of businesses 
they have control over." 

" 

Carruthers and Watson defended the university's 
policy as beneficial to serving the needs of the 
campu. 

"We're protecting our own interest by not trying 
to overly compete," Carruthers said. ". wouldn't say 

We're protecting our own interests by not trying to ove~y compete .... 
I wouldn't say it's a monopoly. 

" JIM CARRUTHERS 
University Center Director 

" When the Price Center went up originally, they 
wanted it to be a success in terms of [reducing] 
coming and going." Tedder said. "They wanted to 
get the businesse off the ground. It really doe 
stack the deck." 

it's a monopoly. 
"I think that whoever runs a busine s on campus 

takes a certain risk. It's to the advantage of both 
parties for u to manage the risks as much as 
possible:' he continued. 

"There is at least a good-faith intention ... to tell 
vendors ' this i the environment you're entering,' .. 
Watson said. "We're saying we want vendors who 
view themselve as part of the campus. who seek to 
serve the university. The university has the re ponsibil-
ity to assure them that they will not be adversely 
affected. " 

"1be idea is that the students have a choice," 
Carruthers said. "We maintain choices for people ... so 
if you want a beer, you can get a beer." He continued. 
explaining that Price Center customers may buy a 
hamburger at Wendy's and bring it to Round Table if 
they wish to also drink a beer with it. 

Carruthers also asserted that not only are other 
campus businesses, like the co-op , not hurt by the 
restriction on products they may sell, but they benefit 
because the University Center takes a percentage of the 
Price Center businesses' profit. 

"We take dollars from the food vendors ... and 
distribute them to any number of areas on campu~ . 
111ese entities are sub~idizing other oper.uions." he 
said. 

Last year, the GSA pledged $20.000 to the 
UCB's pub renovation project, in exchange for the 
construction of a bar area in the facility. Members of 
the GSA said that graduate students saw a need for a 

Fremont said when he returned to Tucker and 
Carruthers, they then said that there was a verbal. 
not wrinen. commitment of exclusivity to the Round 
Table vendor. 

Carruthers acknowledged that there is an "oral 

He said that he could think of two motives the 
administration might have in suggesting that the 
new pub be put in the Che Cafe. "One, they would 
love to see someone else take over that building. 
And two. there's a large series of police citations on 
that building - there's no way the ABC [Alcohol 
and Beverage Commission] would license that 
building. 

"I've always been skeptical about the 
university's strict adherence to policy." said 
University Center Board Chair Molly McKay. "The 
only rules that exist are what the university says. For 
example, there is supposed to be one alcohol 
vendor, but that's not true. 

"What they promised the [Price Center] vendors 

A plan introduced by the UCB, the GSA and the A.S. to revive the old Triton Pub has 
administrators reneging on their claim that there can be only one beer vendor on 
campus. Now that the Bullseye Tavern's lease is up for renewal, the administration 

is allowing another pub on campus. Members of the GSA said graduate 
students saw a need for a traditional English pub - a quieter, darker place 
than Round Table.
