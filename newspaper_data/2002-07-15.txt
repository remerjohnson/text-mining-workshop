Charges against the Koala are dropped 
J-board not convinced that the humor 
publication disrupted a MEChA meeting 
By EVAN MCLAUGHLIN 
News Editor 

Charge::~ tha t the KUfl la disrupt-
ed ,\ ,'v1 ovmi ento Estudi 'lntil 
C hlCana/o de Aztian meeting Nov. 
19, ]00 1, were dropped by the 
UCS [) administrati on after the 
ca mpus-wide jud icial board found 
that there:: was ll1sufficient evidence 
against the snldent publication in a 
June S hearing. 

"The complaint was dismissed 
hy th~ designated dean o f students 
based Ilil the lindings and conclu-
sions submitted to the dea n by the 
campus-wide judicial board," sai d 
Director o f Student Policies and 
Judicial Affairs Nicholas S. Aguilar. 

While the judicial ' board case 
aga inst the Koala has been 
brought to a close, the conflict 
between the Koalo and the UCSD 
administration has erupted into a 

nati onal spectacle. 
T he struggle between the un i-

versity and the Koala has gai ned 
attention from national media o ut-
lets, including TIN WflII S tru t 
Journfll, Dr. Laura Schlessinger's 
syndicated radio progra m a nd 
United Press In ternational. The 
Freedom of Individual Rights in 
Educa tion center has also posted a 
press release on its Web sitt! accus-
ing the UCS O administration of 
bias against the Koala for its con-
tent. Within its June 2 1 statemenr, 
EI.R.E. accused Aguilar of "aban-
doning even the appearance of 
impartiali ty." 

Vice Chancellor of Stud ent 
Affairs Joseph W . Watson asserts 
that the judicial board hearing was 
never a question of the KOllla's case, 
but was in regards to the isolated 
incident involving the MEChA 
meeting. 

" It is extrem ely IInpon ant to 
understand tha t the action t:lken 
by the ul1lvcrsity have nothin g to 
do with the Koala's coment, but 
rathe r with its conduct of behav-
ior," W atson said . 

According to George Liddle, 
editor in chief o f the KUflla, the 
media 's attention o f the contlict has 
stelllm ed from a set of e- mai ls 
between /\1 EChA member Ernesto 
Marti nez, the stude nt complaint:lnt 
of th e N ov. 19 incident, and 
Agui la r. T he series of e- mails, 
Liddle alleged, are evidence of the 
un iversity's "gigantic amou nt of 
favoritism" towards MEChA in the 
resolutio n process. 

Also an issue, Liddle said, is the 
failure on Aguilar's part to address 
vio lent implications made by 
Martinez in the e- mails. 

"It has crossed my mind sever-
al tim es to physica lly fight back so 

Guordlan fi le pOOIO 

Looking for answers: While the Koala won its case in front of the JudiCial 
board, it seeks further legal ad ion in a pending lawsuit against the univerSity. 
this ca n stop," stated Martin ez in 
one e -mail. "If no positive support 
is rereivcd frol11 UCSD admll1is-
tratio n [such as puning a stop to 
the Koala], then we as students of 

colo r wi ll have to retaliate." 
Liddle condemned the adll1ll1lS-

tration's response to M art inez's

Mandate reserves used to pay for extra expenses 
By LAURA MCGANN 
Associate News Editor 

A $1.2 million 2002-2003 A.S. 
Council Executive Budget was 
passed during the tenth week of 
spring quarter during the A.S. 
Council's final meeting of the year. 
The executive budget, written by 
A.S. President Jenn Brown, deter-
mines how each UCSD student's 
$21 quarterly activi ty fee will be 
spent during the upcoming year. 

T he A.S. programming depart-
ment, which organi zes sllch con-
certs as Fall Fest, WinterFesr and 
Sun G od, received the largest allo-
cation of the total $425,000. While 
WinterFest and Sun God will be 
operating under the same budget as 
they did during the 2001 -2002 
school year, Fall Fest has received 
an additional $15,000. The funding 
increase will be use d to move the 
concert from its uSlial venue, 
RIMAC Arena, out to RIMAC 
field, which has a larger capacity. 

Brown said that the reason for 
moving the concert to the field was 
due to the 2002 concert's inability 
to accommodate the number of 
students wishing to attend.

"Thousands of sn.dents had to 
be turned away last year," Brown 
said. 

This year's council has also set 
the improvement of school spirit 
on campus as a high priority. 
Because of this, the budget has allo-
ca ted an additional $1 4,000 to 
Athletic Relations to fund the spir-
it association Triton T ide. 

"With Robin Shelton as the 
commissioner of a thletics next year, 
we expect Triton T ide to just 
explode," Brown said.

UCSD receives $2.5 million in 
funding for composite metal 
researCh 

A $2.5 million multidisciplinary university 
research initiative has been awarded to researchers 
at the Jacobs Schools of Engineering to develop 
and test a composite metal material capable of 
retuming to its original form after undergoing shape 
changes. 

The project's benefactor, the Office of Naval 
Research, wishes to apply the study'S findings in its 
construction of ships, submarines and other vehi-
cles and structures. 

The composite metal, known as shape memory 
alloy, will be able to return the material back to its 
original shape after undergoing superelastic defor-
mations. 

Sia Nemat-Nasser, the director of the Center of 
Excellence for Advanced Materials and principal 
investigator of the project. will be making break-
Ihrough improvements to the shape memory alloy 
family, which was originated over 30 years ago. 

Nemat-Nasser, arong with Professor. Kf!lneth 
Vecchio and researchers from the Unrvet'5lty of 
Washington and California Institute of Technology, 
will be combining non-metallic materials with plates 
of shape memory Nickel-Titanium and rods embed-
ded with hollow ~ass beads in the development of 
the new composite metals.

Berkeley among colleges 
to track foreign students 

Debate rises over cross 
on college campus 
Questions over separation of church 
and state emerge over memorial Government-launched program will 

monitor activities of international visitors (U-WIRE) HOUSTON -
After .being pull ed over by a 
H ouston Police Department patrol 
car on his way to work in the early 
hours of a November night, Byron 
G illum was shot dead five minutes 
la ter on Universi ty of Houston 
grounds.

death on a Houston freeway aft er a 
traffic altercation . Both Gi llll m 
and Delaney were black. In Ihe 
Gillum case, the H oustOn Police 
Department officer was white. In 
the Delaney incident, the oft1cer 
was Hispanic. 

(lJ-WIRE) BERKELEY, Cali f. 
- Some certi fied schools across the 
nation began helping the U.S. gov-
ernment track international sru-
dents last week by releasing srudent 
info rmation to the Immigration 
and Naruralization Service via an 
electronic database. 

T he computer program, the 
Student and Exchange Visi tor 
Information System, allows 
schools across the United States 
to transmi t informatio n about 
international srudcnts to the lNS 
and the Department of State. 

Congress passed the computer 
program in the late I 990s, but 
intense lobbyi ng for international 
st udent privacy sta lled the pro-
b'Tam's implementation. 

For now, the electronic da ta-
base includes mainly small schools 
that volunteer to disclose srudent 
information. It contains the date 
an ind ividual srudent enters and 
exi ts a school, as well as the stu-
dent's major. 

rn the future, the database may 
also include international srudent 
course schedules and a list of the 
organizations and clubs to which 
each srudent belongs. 

All schools will be required to 
enter international srudent infor-
mation into the database by Jan. 
30. University of California , 
Berkeley plans to enter its interna-
ti onal students into the system 
sometime before the deadline 
mandated by the INS. 

Because 2,500 international 
students from more than 90 dif-
ferent countries attend UC 
Berkeley, the university will not 

enter the srudents into the pro-
gram until the system has a "batch 
capability." T he upgrade would 
allow the system to process large 
numbers of records at once. 

University offic ials say it wi ll 
take a lot of work to transfer the 
student information from paper to 
electronic form. 

"It certainly is creating a lot of 
work for us, mainly just because it's 

"We need to find a 
balance between the 
important and useful 
information and the 

not important 
information:' 

- Bruce Cain 
Political science professor, 

UC Berkeley 

a huge change in the way things are 
done, " said David Brandt, the 
international student and scholar 
advisor at UC Berkeley. 

Critics called the new comput-
er system "intrusive" and question 
its functionality. 

"In the end , some of that 
information really is inappropri-
ate for the government to be col -
lecting," said Bruce Cain, a U C 
Berkeley political science profes-
sor. "We need to find a bal ance 
between the important and use-
ful information and the not 
important information.» 

Some international students 
also oppose the constr uction of 
the database and say it is a viola-
tion of a srudent's privacy. 

"I thinle that it is very unfa ir 
and it goes against the privacy of 
the person," said Maria, a UC 
Berkeley international student 
from Spain who declined to give 
her last name. 

O ther srudents support the pro-
gram and say that it is a necessary 
security precaution in light of Sept. 
11. 

"On the one side, I wouldn't 
like it at all that someone records 
what I'm doing here," said 
Ricarda, a UC Berkeley interna-
tional student from Germany who 
also declined to give her las t 
name. "On the o ther hand , 1 
understand ... perhaps you can 
prevent some terrorist attacks." 

Srudent records under scrutiny 
have not been limited to only 
those of internati onal students. 
Since Sept. II , federal agents have 
been searching srudent records 
without notification. 

Law enforcement officials have 
had "virtually unfettered" access to 
any srudent recorcls from colleges 
and universities, said Barmak 
Nassirian, associate executive of the 
American Association of Collegiate 
Registrants and Admissions 
Officers. 

Lawyers for the American 
Civil Liberties U nion are current-
ly researching the consti rutionali-
ty of the computer program.

at the 
cross roads 

The Mount Soledad cross's 
future is needlessly murky 

t he cross on Mount Solcd,ld has been under scrutiny for over J3 years, and it will 
remain that way until it is remuved 
or resold. 

There is no reason for thi s ulti -
matum: Philip Paul on, an atheist 
and member of the Society of 
Separationists, doesn't really want 
what is constitutional in the sepa-
ration of church and sta te. Paulson 
just wants to attack Christianity. 

Philip Paulson and Howard 
Kreisner attested in court in 
1989 that they we re "deeply 
offended" by the cross on the 
mountain and 

tnvor the memurial assot'l,ltIon (II'

cross." In short, prosccutcrs s.lId , 
"The deck was tacked ."

Go cry me a river. I lose my 

freedom to go to public places 
when parks bel:Ollle well -known 
hangouts for gang members and 
my life is at risk for wearing the 
wrong color, but this doesn't give 
me the right to sue. 

Last Au!,'ust, the Ninth Circuit 
Court of Appeals approved the 
sale of the cross to a non-profit 
memorial association. On june 26 
of this year, the court reversed that 
decision, making the ,;ale void 
because those in favor of the cross 
were "given <In cdge," as put hy an 
editor for HI' SLlIl Oil'go Unioll-
Tn!J/lI/('. 

The editor for a similar article in 
TIll' Sa(1'LlmCI/tO Ber quotes Paulson 
and his attorneys as saying "the hid-
ding process fur the land was 
!lawed," and that "the city's requjre-
ments for the purchase tended to 

religiOn/church," 
according to the daily appellate 
report taken on March 24, 1993, 
by Circuit judge Beezer. 

I have 00 problem with that. 
Everyone in the United States is

Cross: 
Litigation motivated by 
hatred of Christianity 
Continued from page 4 

Furthermore, Paulson himself 
wrote an article for The HII7nII1Iist in 
which he makes his stance on God 
clear. While fighting in Viemam, 
he lost his faith in God, crying, 
"You sadistic God! You 're not wor-
thy of my worship I" and "To hell 
with God l" Although I have never 
been in a wartime si tuation and 
therefore cannot truly understand 
hi, anger toward or "fallout" with 
God, I nt:vertheless cannot compre-
hend why Paulson must force that 
anger on thousands of others who 
don't share the same feeling. 

There have heen many battles 
against Christiani ty and the beliefs 
held by Christians. Most recently, 
two words, which no one really 
cared about until they were chal -
ICI11{cd , were stri cken from the 

1'le ~lge of Allegiance: "Under God" 
wa, hcld to be unconstinltional. 

\Nhy taxp"yers had to spend 
thcir money on a case that makes 
little or no difference today is 
bevond me. When was the last 
til;le \Ve said the pledge anyway? 
And when we did , it didn't mean 
anythi ng to liS, did it? Not really 
- it was just something we sa id 
before learning about long divi-
sIon . 

Does this theme of wasteful 
and unn ecessary lawsuits have ro 
continue? I don 't believe Paulson 
has a problem with the cross on 
public land . 1 believe he has a 
problem with the cross in general . 
and by coupling nis personalmoti-
vation behind these "constitution-
al" lawsuits with the sketchiness of 
the case's hase in the first place, 
the affair becomes clearly ridicu-
lous. 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 5 

Ice cream and idiots make for a stupid summer 

basically 

Being around ice cream is kind of 
like when you meet 
The Sexiest Actor Alive 
in the supermarket: It 
looks really good, but 
it turns you into a 
stumbling, bumbling, 
not-eve n -c I ose-to-
being-sexy idiot. 

When I got a part-time job at a 
frozen yogurt shop near my apart-
ment, I had three goa ls in mind: 

To get free ice cream. 
To earn a little extra cash (with 

which to buy ice cream). 
To get free ice cream with free 

toppings on it. 
I have since added an objective 

to my list: To lIor kill the next per-
son who asks me what the fat-free 
fl avors are. 

You see, there are seven 
yogurt machines, each of wh ich 
holds a separate frozen yogurt 
flavor. 1\vo of the machines are 
always full of fat-free flavors , 
which are alwaY$ chocolate and 
vanilla. And because the owner of 
the establishment actually 
thought that the people who 
come in would be more intelli -
gent than your average pile of 
shit, the names of the tlavors are 
right there on the machi nes, in 
peppy, bright letters. And right 
there, ri ght und erneath the 
words "chocolate" and "vanilla ," 

is a sign that says "Fat Free." 
These are not SAT words, 

people. A five-year-old could read 
them. There is no rea.l'011 for any-
one to ask what the fat-free flavors 
are. But this is what always hap-
pens: 

An idiot comes in. Call it a sixth 
sense if you will, but I can always 
tell which ones the idiots arc. 
What can I say' - I have a gift. 

Anyway, this idiot will squint 
(even t110ugh the signs are two feet 
from the counter) at the frozen 
yogurt machines for a couple of 
minutes, looking confused ;1I1d, 
well, idiotic. 

Idiot: "So, what flavors does 
this frozen yogurt come in?" 

Me (smiling sweetl y, being the 
patient, loving person that 1 am): 
"They're ri ght there on the 
machines." 

Idiot (nodding nonchalan tly) : 
" Rii ii iight. But which are fa t 
free ?" -

Me (sti ll paticnt and loving) : 
"The on~s right u,?,c1er the sign 
that says, Fat Free. 

Idiot (rea lly eXl:ired): "Oh yum! 
Peanut butter and strawberry!" 

Me (not as loving, but still 
smiling - 1 really want a tip here): 
"No. Vanilla and chocolate. Those 
are always the fat-free llavors." 

Idiot (no longer exci ted, glar-
ing at me accusingly): "Oh no, I 
don't think so. Last week it was 
on1l1ge and caramel. " 

Me (this person better give me 
a lot of extra money, because I am 
still smiling) : " o. It' always 
chocolate and vanilla." 

Idiot (not believing a word of 
it): "Are you sure'" 

Me (my face "fally hurts)· 
"Positive." 

Idiot (ready to pig out): "0 K, I 
want a large strawberry." 

1 deal with these people all day. 
These are the people running the 
big businesses of San Diego. The 
same morons who can't read a 
danm frozen yogurt flavor sign are 
the CEOs of Microsoft. 

But, to be fair, ice cream makes 
me stupid, too. One of my jobs 
(besides being nice to illiterate 
dieters) is to clean the yogurt 
machines and change the non-fat-
free fla vors (because, as we have 
established, the fat-free ones IIn'fI ' 
rbo1lgt) . 

Surprisingly, 1 don't denl with 
machinery as well as I do with peo-
ple. I know what you're thinking: 
How can that be? I am so amica-
ble! But it's true. 

1 am the kind of person who 
can't work a toaster without read-
ing the instruction manual -
front-to-back - at least four 
ti mes. T hen I will burn the toast 
anyway, so I'll call 1-800-TOAST-
IT, the toll -free toast help line. 
T hen I'll electrocute myself trying 
to get new bread in, which will 
remind me that I don 't even like 
roast. 

So bcrng in charge of machines 
th;lt actually turn goo (yes, that is a 
very technical ice cream term) into 
frozen yogurt probably isn 't a 
good idea . 

One night, after making a 
brand new batch of cookies 'n 
cream, I realized that the machine 
was broken. I discovered this after 
15 minutes of pulling the handl e 
and not getting anything out. 
Yeah, that took 15 minutes. 

So I ca lled the manager. 
Me (trying not to sound 

alarmed, even though six jenny 
Craig patients just ordered cookies 
'n cream): "Ben, the machi ne is 
broken!" 

Ben (annoyed because he was 

trying to gct rnto his gl rlfncnd\ 
pams at the time): .. Did you put 
the fl avor in'" 

Me (realizing that jenny Craig 
customers are sca ry) : "Ycsl 
Cookies 'n cream!" . 

Ben (trying not to show that he 
is impressed witll my flavor) : " Did 
you put the suction h'ose in the 
bucket?" 

Me (God , these people are 
going to eat me) : "Yes! Into the 
cookies 'n crea lll hucket !" 

Ben (holdrng h;ld Ill!> pr.II'c): 
"OK, did you close the dow';" 

,VIc (wondering if 1 should 
throw Reeses Pieces at the jennv 
Craig-ers to keep them at bay): 
"The cookies 'n cream dUlIr?" 

Ben (horny and pissed by now ): 
"Dammit arric, get lIvcr the 
cookies 'n cream." 

Me (reall y di sappOi nted th :1I 
Ben isn't into Oreos) : "Yes, 1 ,hut 
rhe door." 

Ben's girlfriend must ha ve 
given lip on hll11 a t that pOI Ill, 
because he rea lly started to foet", 

Ben (is that his teeth 1 h";lr 
grinding?): "Carrie , did Y()U till 11 
the machine on?" 

Ohhhhhhh i 
Me (light bulb going on 'JilT 

my head): "OK, hye Ikl1 '" 
(Turning to the jenny Cnllg p<.:tI-
pie happily) "It 's O K guy,! l' ttl 
going to nlrn the yogurt on no\\, '" 

I bet Ben was sa ying the S,1II1 e 
thing to his girlfriend n ght ahout 
then . 

So basica ll y, if yo u cat ICc 
cream, you're an idiot. I I' )'011 \l'or i.: 
with ice cream, yo u're ,Ill idiot 
who gets free dessert. And If you 
ask me what the fat- free l!avllI" 
are, I will shove a \Va ffle CIIlle \I P 
your ass. 

And then I will turn )Ollr 
yogurt on.

Summer 
Concert Preview 
A lillnyof performing artists and athlctes will assemble at the Coors Amphitheater for the Jeep World Outside Festival. Presented by House of Blues, the Jeep World Outside Festival will use its music and outdoors to ce le-

brate the sun and surf of San Diego. With twu stages, a 
variety of elaborate sports facilities and several cxhibits, the fcsti\'al 
promises to please diverse tastes in Illusic and pastimes. 

The first half of the festival - the music portion - offers plenty 
of rock 'n' roll and, of course, the ubiquitous reggae act. Headlining is 
Sheryl Crow, the Southern California diva of beach music. Fans can 
expect her to support hcr new album, "C'mon C'mon," which has 
recently been eating up air time with the appropri atel y-named ~i n glc 
"Soak Up The Sun." Thc album has been dcscribed as offering the 
feeling of driving to the beach during summer vaca ti on, wh ich i, proh-
ably why she was chosen to headline. 

Sharing the first stagc with Crow is Train, Of A Revolut ion ,11 1<1 
Ziggy Marley. OA.R. draws strong Dave Matthews Band compamons 
due to their usc of the saxophone and acoustic guitar, and they seem 
to be the most ami -beach band on the first stage. Unlikc Train, who 
relocated to San Francisco, O.A.R. hails from Ohio. Rounding out the 
mellow vibe is Ziggy Marley, the son of Bob Marley, who has takt:n up 
his dad's place with the Melody Makers. Ziggy and company's pntent-
cd pop-reggac will undoubtedly induce some high timcs, though nn 
album of new music hasn't come out of the Marley camp since 199() 's 
"The Spirit of Music." 

On the second stage is an even larger selection of music, including 
the luscious R&B sounds of Remy Shand, the blues of Doyle Branhall 
and the acollstic folk of Howie Day. Tonic will also be in attendance, 
a band you may remember from hits "Open Up Your Eyes" ;lI1d "If 
You Could Only See" off of 1996's "Lemon Parade." 

Rounding Out the second stage is jam-laden Pseudopod, who's self-
titled release is packed with jazz fusion, funk and up-tempo prog-rock. 
While it may sound like an odd mix, Pseudopod is just quirky amI 
expansive enough to fit right in with rest of the acts. 

Athletics form the second half of the festival, one part pro-exhibi -
tion, onc part demo for attendees. If you want to learn how to kayak, 
you can take advantage of the gigantic 30,OOO-galion pool. Or perhnps 
you don't feel like getting wet. There is always the 24-foot rock climh-
ing tower, the mountain bike course or the slci slope simulator. There 

is even an opportunity to le;lrn to scuba dive, 
which, according to festival organizers, is the only 
sport to include the all -important factor of rd ax-
ation. All the demos ,Ire staffed with pcrsonnel to 
assist the learning process. 

Of the professionals, there are several kayakcrs, 
mountain bikers and a few slciers and snow bo,lrd-
ers. Amid the mountain bikers is Jeff Lenosky, 
who holds the world record for the vcrtical leap 
with a bike at 45.5 inches. There will also be sev-
eral spons-rela ted vendors on hand to give demos 
of thei r equipment. Even Gi bson guitars will he 
present. 

Sound like an awful lot to see and do: Well , the 
wonderfu l people in charge have already thought 
of that, so they're opening the gates th ree hou rs 
early. So pack your waterproof sunscrccn and get 
ready to appreciate everything tllJt LS the grt:,11 
outdoors - or at least as much as they could take 
on tour with them. 

The Jeep World Outside comes to the Coors 
Amphitheater on July 25. Doors op<: n at 3 p.III ., 
and music is scheduled to start at 6 p.m.

Since rh en, rh e world of pop-

"Malcolm in The Middle ," titled 
"You're Not the Boss of ,\Ie

recently won a Grammy. 

The talent level of the grollp 
is clear enough; the on ly thing in 
questio n is how the group 
chooses to spend their enerb'Y. 
The band released "Mink CIr," 
an album that fea tured jllst what 
)'OU expect fr om the group: 
songs that are lyri cally and musi-
cally innovative :tnd cl ever. 

Th e group also recentl y

which is tOuted as the bamJ's 
" tlrst album for rhe whole falll i-

.\1enacing, clark and eerie; 311 
arc words that jump to mind when 
thinking of the explosive death 
metal band Nile. Despitc being 
from SOllth Carolina, Nile has 
forgcd a disti nct sound that they 
call "lthyphallic Metal," which is a 
combination of occu lt and pagan 
ohscssiuns of the ancient Egyptian 
religion, along with heavy Middle 
Fastern music inUucnces. The 
rcsult is one of the 1II0st intriguing 
and distinctive sounds in lIlodcrn 
death metal. 

,\1' tel' forging their uniquc tyle 
with (he groundhreaking 
",\\IlOngst the Catacomhs of 
:-<ephrcn-Ka" in 1998, Nile began 
cllmhin!{ up the underground 
dt llng ,ul'port work for estab-
lished old -seilOol :lCts like 
Ohi[u;II'\'. 

\ Vh:I't followed was a IO UI' as 
hrutal alld bli ster ing as Nil e 's 
unprecedented speed and power. 
I':ightcen months on the road saw 
the hand crossi ng the Atlantic to 
support Morbid Angel's world 
tour, including the infamous 
Dvno festival. 

. Two years later brought the 
JIlind -blowing ~nd subgcnre-
crossing "Black Seeds of 
Vengeance ," which, by all 
accounts, was a masterpiece of 
rel entless blast beats, brutal 
death metal and content-span-

the fu ll blossoming of Nile's for-
ward-thinki ng approach to death 
metal. 

"Black Seeds of Vengeancc" 
remains camped in orthodox 
death metal, but expands beyond 
the limited vision. that often traps 
many bands. Using dynamic 
instruments like kettle drums, 
tablas, sitars, tempuras and 
Tibetan Doom horns, an expan-
sive and attention-demanding 
release was wrought. Along with 
the subsequent touring and co-
headlining with Cann ihal 
Corpse, 'il e managed to bring 
their sound to an evcn wider 
audience. Even those who don't 

like grinding death mct;" were 
forced to respect the awesoltle 
might and sonic vision that is 
Nile. 

But be forcwarned: Those not 
familiar with death metal will eas-
ily be put off by the genre's disre-
gard ror tOne and con entional 
rhythm. If nuthing else, juS! look 
at songs like "Invocation of the

111 a few weeks, "Rent," one of 
the most successful musical s in 
Broadway history, will once again 
come to the San Diego Civic 
Theatre. 

The best way to descri he: 
"Rent," for those who have never 
secn it, is with the words sex, drugs 
and rock 'n' roll cornbined with 
love, hate, life and death. 

Loosely based on Puccini 's "La 
Boheme," "Rent" deals with issues 
like hOlllclessness, drug addiction 
and NOS. Sct in cw York, " Rent" 
tells the story of a grull p of friend, 
trying to fi l,rurc alit how to best live 
their lives. 

T here is 110 single plot or ma in 
character in thi s IIlllsical. The story 
bllilds in hi ts anrl pieces while the 
charac ters move in and our of each

10 HIATUS THE U D GUARDIAN 

New DVD releases help fill 
those dull summer evenings 
From sci-fi to experimental movies, there are 
plenty of reasons to stay inside and watch TV 
By CHARLIE TRAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Royal Tenenbaums 

**** 
For those th,n live with a dys-

fUIH.:tional f:lmil>', \Ves Anderson 's 
I:lte,t <:OII1l:dic work will surely 
hr ill !! om all those memories that 
~·tHl ~\' ()llid rather forget. Fear not, 
,eetng another weird family 
II1stcad of your own is an enjoy-
,Iblc cxperience in "The Royal 
Tcncnbaums. " 

C;cne Hackman plays Royal 
' Iencnbaum, the head of a trou-
bled household of family genius-
es [hat he hasn't seen ur talked to 
ill years. His chi ldren, Chas (Ben 
Su ller ), ,\1argot (Gwenyth 
Paltrow) and Ritchie (Luke 
Wilsun), h.ne him, and he was 
recently k.icked Ollt of his resi-
dence . When Ethe line (Anjelica 
Ilouston) starts considering 
another marriage, Royal tries to 
win back her heart and reunite 
with the family at the same time. 
The family reunion proves to be 
tlIlllultuous, but for the first 
tlm<:, hb paternalistic humanity 
is s(!cn . 

"Royal Tencnb,lUllls" is similar 
in style and feci to "Rushmore" 
with' its eccentric exposition of 
human frailrv and emotions. The 
-Icnenbaums are clearly out of 
plilce in the world they live in, and 
their lives show it. To some, this 

m~kcs for a humourous film; for 
othcrs, it's not going to inate 
bughter. 

The DVD shows the hard 
work put into this film. 
Andersun's audio commentary is 
sharp and insightful, providing 
interesting anecdotes for the 
entirc length of the film . 
Although there are few outtakes, 
the lllust-see shot is that of 
Anjclica Houston's hair catching 
on tire. 

Additional supplements 
include cast interviews and several 
fc:lturettes on the 'IrlWork of the 
tilm. Although these extras do add 
SOIllC insight, i[ is the auelio com-
Illcnrarv that makes the DVD 
worth ~ie\Ving.

Amelie 

*** 
Watching "Amelie" is like 

entering a confectionary: Bright 
colors and juvenile innocence 
emanates everywhere. One of the 
most charming tilms ever cre<lt-
ed, "Amclie" has melted hearts 
not unly in France, but <l lso 
throughout art houses in the 
States. 

Amelie, played by the enchan t-
ing Audrey Tautou, is a young 
Parisian woman who has lived a 
childhood without the sights, 
sounds and smells of a normal 
chi ld growing up. Now 20-some-
thing, Amelie takes pleasure in 
making life a more hospitable 
place for strangers even though 
she can't solve the problems in her 
own life. 

DVD 
REVIEWS 

While she brings happiness and 
joy to the lives of others, Anlelie 
slowly comes to grip with the 
issues revolving around her life. 

The tilm is dripping with 
bright colors and exaggerated 
tints that can be best seen in the 
DVD transfer. Being :l two-disc 
set, Amelie has plenty of addition-
al fearures that take several days of 
vlewmg. 

There's a lot - toO much in 
fact - about director Jean-Pierre 
Jeunet, with not only a director's 
commentary, but also two Q&As, 
an intimate conversation and a 
featurette on the director's work. 
However, the commentary is a joy 
to watch and shows Jeunet's 
comedic side. 

A feantrette on tile "Look of 
'Amclie'" is not only interesting, but 
it shows how tile environment of 
the film matches Amelie's persona. 

"Amelie" is the perfect date 
movie, providing a cheery opti-
mism that is not cliche and over-
bearing like so many other fi lms 
today. 

Star Trek: 
The Next Generation, 

. season three 

*** 
After already releasing seasons 

one and two of "Star Trek: 
TNC," lI'ckics ca n be delighted 
with th e complete season three on 
DVD. 

Season three is widely consid-
ered to be the beginning of the 
strong, memorable episodes that 
detined "TNG." 

vVith two seasons finished , the 
cast and crew seems finally at ease 
with the show, and the cama-
raderie is apparent in both writing 
and acting. It also marks the 
return of Dr. Beverly Crusher 
after a disappea rance in the sec-
ond season. 

Similar to the tirst two sea-
sons' worth of DVDs, the third 
season has all the episodes in a 
high-quality transfer. The visual 
effects are improving and can be 
seen throughout the episodes. 
With its growing popularity and 
fa nbase, season three exudes 
contidence while it steps out of 
the shadows of the original 
series. 

The pi nnade of season three is 
ditThanger episode "The Best of 
Both Worlds," in which Captain 
Picard (Patrick Stewart) becomes 
,I Borg. This episode remains one 
of the most beloved by Star Trek 
fans . 

The DVD set also includes 
four featu rettes that are once 
again si milar to the previous 
DVD sets'. Most of the segments 
are a bout looking back on the 
season and discovering the 
actOrs' favorite episodes. These 
supplements are now the norm 
rHhe r than a standout in DVD 
se ts. Beyond the extras, the 
strong storyline and excellent 
episodes carry the season three 
DVD set. 

Nevertheless, it has never 
been a better time for Star Trek 
fans while Paramount continues 
to release "TNC" episodes 
throughout the rem.l inder of the 
year.

"By The Way," you're not 
expecting this from the 
Red Hot Chili Peppers 
The new RHCP album is the most 
uncharacteristic release to date 
By JEFFREY WHITE 
Senior Staff Writer 

It's a fan's worst fear : the "weird 
album." Most major bands do it; 
Radiohead's "Amnesiac" and U2's 
"Zooropa" come to mind as a cou-
ple prime examples. For many, such 
oddities remain on the CD rack for 
posterity and good sportsmanship. 

In their latest release, "By the 
Way," the Red Hot Chili Peppers 
have officially gone off the deep 
end. T hey've made their weird 
album. 

Gone are our beloved L.A. 
funky punk rappers spewi ng pro-
fanity, raunch and the punchiest 
funk -rock grooves aro und. 
However, the band that has 
emerged in its place has its 
strengths exactly where they were 
previously lacking. The new 
Peppers find strength in melody 
instead of riffs; in seamless unity 
rather than unbridled testosterone. 

Interestingly, the Chili Peppers' 
"weird album" is probably their 
most mainstream - another dread-
ed part of the Fan's Greatest Fears 
List. Though the band has been 
heavily marketed since its water-
shed 1991 release, "Blood Sugar 
Sex Magic," this latest album has to 
be the most hyped of them all . 

MTV, MTV 2 and VH-\ upped 
their play of anything Chili 
Peppers to sickening levels. San 
Diego alternative radio station 91 X 
played a new song off the album 
every day leading up to its July 9 
release. RHCP Backyard Barbecue 
Sweepstakes entry boxes appeared 
in Quizno's sandwich shops around

over-only venues) will be normal 
shows in support of "Mink Car." 
It's hard to know what to expect 
when headed into a night at a 
They Might Be Giants show; a 

the country (I'm keeping my lin-
gers crossed). 

Also, fans registered on 
h Trp :/ /www.rtdho rcbilipfppe7.J.com 
received daily e-mai ls directing 
them to a site where they could 
hear one new song off the album 
per day. Although it was a great 
idea in theory, it may have back-
tired . Some complained that the 
sound quality of stn:aming 
Internet audio detracted heavily 
from the songs. This is true - the 
album didn't sound ne;lrly as good 
as it is when heard at fu ll CD qU'II-
ity. 

It's hard to say whether the hype 
can be attributed to Warner Bros. 
knowing it has a dynamite album 
on its hands or knowing it's has .1 
mainstream, marketable album . 
Most likely, it's both. 

"By the Way" is a great album 
- no doubt about it . The song-
writing is bener than it's ever been, 
the music is extremely tight (don't 
look for out-of-connol bass or gui-
tar solos), and there's enough 
syrupy melody to keep a different 
track sruck in your head, depending 
on which one was playing when 
you got out of your car.

This may be the No. I reason

all too many rock bands come out 
and play their albums from edge 
to center.

Jt )Slt (:I~I )L 'SF 

T he title of Best Living Baseball 
Player is up for 
grabs for the first 
time in quite a while 
due to the passing 
of baseball legend 
and national hero 
Ted Williams. 

\ \ 'ill l.lIm pJ"cd .l\""y./uly 5 In a 
I'lortd.l Ihl'>PI I"I , le:l\'lllg- hehind ,1 
k-~;lC\' of h.l'oehall g-n:,lllll!S~. 

, Thl! San Dlcg-;) lwive reached 
lh", n,lllllllJI .. porllght ill 11)39 with 
lhe 130'0101l Red Sox and never 
lu()k",d h.lCk . \ Villiallls' numbers 
.Ire gml-like and truly worthy of his 
Il all of Fame ~rarus . Ilowever, one 
ha .. to wonder what those numbers 
lI'ould have been like if rhe 
'>plendld Splinter hadn 't losr ~ve 
prime YC:lrs to lighting in both 
\ \'orld \ Var II and the Korean \iVar 
.l'o a lighter pilor. 

If ' Ihldy Ballg'lme had those 
live ~l!aSons back, statistici ans have 
proJl!Cled thar he would be the 311-
tllne leader in RBIs, runs and walks. 
I Ie would have been close to 700 
homl!rs. lIe would have had 3,000-
plus hIts. In short, 'vVilliams would 
have been indisputably rhe greatesr 
pl 'lyer to play the game. 

Personally, I rhink rhar ' Ied 
Wilhams is ' already rhe greatest 
player to ever play rhe game. I'd 
hke to sec Barry Bonds hit .388 
II'llh 3H homers at the age of 40. I 
lI'ould likl! to sec any modern slug-
ger go rhrough a season with less 
t1Wl 50 srrikcouts like Williams did 
in all bur three of his seasons - he 
had fi4 as a rookie, 54 in his second 
yea r and 51 in his fourth year. 

I r's a joke and borderline blas-
phemy to even compare players like 
Barrv Bonds to Williams. I will 
gra nt that Bonds is a great player. 
Bur he's nor anywhere close to 
where Ted Williams was as a hitter. 

Modern baseballs are wound 
tighter for more offense. Modern 
hats are crafted more accurately 
and solidl y for berrer pop. Modern 
IJitchers are not allowed to throw 
inside to hirrers. Even if rhey are, 
modern sluggers like Bonds are 
."Iowed to wear armor on their 
e1huws, eliminating fear and allow-
Inl,:' them to put all of their weighr 
IIHO :very pitch . The game is 
gl!ared toward offense, yer modern 

pl,lycr~ still ca n't touch Williams as 
hitler~ . 

;\iulllhcrs aside for a minute, 
' Ied Williams had somerhing else 
that made him so great. It was a 
quality rhat can't be measured . It 
was his courage and commitment 
to his country that made him a role 
model. Thai is a term that isn't 
used too often to describe national 
athletes. But here was a guy who 
gave up tive years of his profession-
al career to defend this country and 
he never complained abour how it

Sports and seven women 's sports, 

In its seven years of experience 
in Division II, UC Davis tinished 
either first or second. The Aggies 
won rhe Sears Cup in 1996, 1997, 
2000 and 2001. 

Accumulating 571.5 points over

more impressive is that our pro-

UC Berkeley faces additional sanctions 
School will appeal additional NCAA punishment for 1999 miscondunct 

BERKELEY - UC Berkeley 
will appeal the National Collegiare 
Athletic Association decision made 
June 26 on past rule violations in 
the school's foorball program, 
according to UC Berkeley 
Chancellor Robert M. Berdahl. 

In publicly reprimanding the 
university for a 19!)9 academic 
fraud case and other rule infrac-
tions involving tlle Cal foorball 
program over the past five years, 
the NCAA imposed a one-year 
postseason ban for 2002 and 
placed the school on a five-year 
probation. The football program 
was penalized further by the loss of 
nine grant-in-aid scholarships over 
the next five seasons (2002 -06). 

"We take violations of NCAA 
rules very seriously at Cal. In 'the 
case of academic fraud, there is no 
university that takes this issue 
more seriously," Berdahl said. 
"For this isolated incident of aca-
demic impropriety, we accepted 
without challenge scholarship loss 
and probation from the Pac-lO. 
Indeed, we self-imposed those 
sanctions. However, in the case of 
the additional infractions, the 
NCAA-imposed penalties appear 
unduly excessive, and that is why 
we have decided to appeaL" 

In regards ro tlle academic case, 
the NCAAS tindings were similar 
to those issued by the Pacilic-IO 
Conference last June. California's 
foorball prognun has already ful-
filled its Pac-IO penalty of losing 
four scholarships, since rhe 
Golden Bears played lasr season 
with only 81 scholarship players. 

This new NCAA ruling, if 
upheld, means Cal would operate 
wirh 83 football players on grant-
in-aid awards during the next four 
years and would field 84 scholar-
ship players in 2006 before 
returning to the NCAA limit of 
85 scholarships in 2007. 

"From the beginning of our 
tenure here, we took this matter 
very seriously," said Stephen C. 
Gladstone, who assumed his cur-
rent athletic director duties last 
June. "The university and the 
Pac-IO office have been very 
proactive in the process. While 
we anticipated that there would 
be added sanctions by the NCAA, 
we certainJy are surprised by the 
severity of this penalty. 

"Fortunately, we can say that 
all corrective actions already have 
been taken internally. With a 
completely new management 
team in place - from the athletic 

directOr and his executive sraff to 
a head football coach - we also 
have installed new procedures 
that will safeguard from this ever 
happening again." 

Specitically, Cal's academic 
improprieties occurred when a 
university professor independent-
ly awarded false academic credits 
to two former student-athletes 
rerroactively in rhe spring of 
1999. The two student-athletes 
then competed in the fall of 1999 
while ineligible, having failed to 
properly earn the minimum num-
ber of academic credits required 
during the academic year for sat-
isfactory progress. 

New to these original viola-
tions reponed to the Pac-lO last 
year, Cal also informed the NCAA 
of 34 football student-athletes who 
received extra benefits while stay-
ing at hotels before competitions. 

The student-athletes incurred 
incidental expenses, ranging from 
75 cents to $323.03, with 20 of 
the 34 playen making less than 
$20 in charges. In addition to the 
34 Cal student-athletes named in 
the report, four football recruits 
visiting the campus also incurred 
hotel charges. These incidental 
violations, which occurred during 

a five-year period from I f)(Ji-
2001, came to Iighr during rhe 
university's self-reported invt~­
tigative findings . 

"I t!xpected we would receive 
some additional penalty from thl! 
NCAA, although it is unfortunarc 
that a new administration and 
coaching staff must bear the hur-
den," said California head foor-
ball coach Jeff Tedfurd, who was 
hired by the school in December. 
"Obviously, we would like to have 
a full complement of scholarships 
and no bowl restrictions this year. 
But I don't expect this ruling to be 
an impediment for our football 
program reaching its ultimate 
goals." 

Gladstone said he was disappi-
onted that this incident would 
overshadow Cal's reputation of 
having gfeat student-athletes. 

""'..5 a whole, Cal features a 
group of student-athletes that 
can rival any college in thc 
United States," Gladstone said. 
"It is truly unfortunate that the 
conduct of a few individual stu-
dent-athletes has overshadowed 
that fact."
