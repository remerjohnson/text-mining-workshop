Stolen body parts 
still· missing 

Casts of rwo small organs were 
stolen from the display case on 
the first floor of the Basic 
Science Building (BSB) the 
morning of Tuesday, Jan. 21 , a 
UCSD medical sc hool official 
said . 

"(The casts) have been in 
there (the case) for years without 
a problem - 1 think I drew 
attention to it ( the display) -
because I lit it up and put in 
something new (a skull, pelvis, 
brain and spinal cord)," Bill 
Collins, senior museum scientist 
at BSB said . 

Pan of the display was found 
wrapped in a towel in front of 
the display case at BSB Saturday 
night by a student who called 
Collins from a pay phone. 

The casts of the organs, a 
diseased fetal heart and lungs, 
were valuable, costing 
approXimately $3000 and one 
year's work, Collins said . 

The lack of effective security 
could explain recent burglaries al 
BSB, he said. 

"The security is vel)' lax 
(here). Too many people have 
access to this building," he 
added. 

The police lock the building 
and have set up student patrols 
to make sure the doors are 
locked , but students come from 
behind them and unlock them, 
he said. 

"They (the police) are going 
nuts ... they're frustrated ," he 
remarked.

Perry said after the settlement, "I 
will continue through the 
appellate courtS to attempt to 
establish a precedent which 
would protect other women from 
this experience." 

In her first filing of the 
lawsuit, Perry requested that 
Atkinson be ordered to make her 
pregnant. However, th is request 
was dropped in several 
subsequent amendments to the 
lawsuit. 

The $250,000 will be paid by 
the Atkinson family. The first 
$125,000 must be paid within a 
month , and the second $125,000 
will be paid by October 5. If 
Ptrry wins her appeal , she may 
win another $25,000.

The pressure of leap frogging 
some of these systems would 
have been off. It would have

Ford said . 

"I believe in SDI (Sp ace

"bUI we must move ahead with

shouldn'l restrain deployment at 
this stage because Congress 
won't put up money for the

research, any development, don't 
deploy." 

Ford views the War Powers 

Resolution as a "disaster." He 
sa id , "First o f all , they are 
unconstitut ional ... There is no 
question that the Supreme Court 
will veto it. Secondly, it is 
impractical. It is totally 
impossible to notify and consult 
with leaders in an emergency. 
And thirdly, it (the resolution) 
makes it difficult for a president 
to achieve and maintain power." 

The President related many 
anecdotes in connection with his 
affai rs a t the White House. One 
that he felt particularly touching 
concerned Brezhnev and himself 
as they toured the city of 
Vladivostok. Holding the 
President's hand, Brezhnev said, 
"You and I both served in World 
War II. Your country lost many 
men as did mine. You and I 
have a responsibility to see that 
that will never happen 
again." ~

On why one would starve for justice 
By ELIZABETH SEARS 

neutrality advances apanheid . This week, several srudents on the UC 
Davis campus will be fasting to protest the 
University of California's continued 
invesnnent in South Africa. I plan to join 
them. 

There are many reasons for the vigil and 
hunger strike which begins today. Chief 
among these is a sense of frustration with 
this administration and its policy of 
"neutrality" in the face of these difficult 
questions. 

Jim Bums, an AS executive Councilmember 
and one of the strikers, told me: "We feel we 
have (0 go a step funher to show we're not 
going to go away. We'll do whatever it takes. 
The one thing we want to get across is how 

working lind taking care of my tamily. 
We're not deluding ourselves. We have 

goals, but realistically, we will feel as if we 
have succeeded if we make progress toward 
thsoe goals. 

1 will feel successful if I make anyone of 
you consider more closely your position on 
u.s. and UC rolicy. 

. " senous we are. 
I'm anticipating criticism of my decision to 

panicipate and 1 don't take criticism or 
ridicule lighdy. 

The hunger strike is an attempt to reach 
UC President David Gardner, the University 
Regents and UCD Chancellor James Meyer. 
We are calling for public discussion of 
apanheid and the university policies on 
student activism, an end to the prosecution 
of the students who occuped the chancellor's 
office last year and a re-opening of the issue 
of divestment. 

Nothing should detract from the symbolism 
and power of a hunger strike. The organizers 
have decided this is the most effective way to 
show the university just how strongly we feel 
about the need for action on South Africa. 
We're not satisfied with the mere gestures 
that the university has offered in place of 
action on this issue. We're not content to be 
quiet. 

Perhaps we'll disturb some people. That's 
good. you should worry, not for our 
discomfon, but for that of South Africa. 

Consider, i you will, the repercussions of 
our country's actions. We pump money into 
the South African economy, and we hire 
South Africans. People may be dependent on 
us, but now we're also dependent on that 
country anp on continuing the status quo. 
We now want a return on our investments, or 
we are coricerned about our supplies of raw 
materials, r:nore than we are concerned for 
justice. We think we can't speak up - that 
we risk too much. 

In truth, the real risk is in remaining silent 
in the presence of this injustice. This will 
earn us enemies within our lifetime, when the 
disenfranchised of South Africa gain power, 
as they inevitably will. 

We would especially like to hear from the 
chancellor, because he is our representative, 
in a sense, for the UC system. It doesn't seem 
right that he refrains from expressing an 
individual opinion, when we're supposed to 
be anending this university to gain the skills 
to be able to express ourselves intelligendy 
and individuaUy. We disagree with university 
policy of remaining disinterested in this 

We're not doing this to be "chic," or 
trendy, and we're not naive about political 
realities in our world. I personally resent the 
criticism often leveled at anti-apanheid 
protestors - diat we are "selective" in our 
outrage. I pride myself in my consistent 
stand for human ri~hts throu&.hout the world.' . 
I do condemn Soviet practices in Afghanistan. 
The fact remains that our government 
officially stands opposed [0 these practices 
and openly aids Soviet victims while we

At the time of all the campus unrest laSt

There are different ways students that

anti-apartheid events, asking questions.

Dartmouth erie. out 

Editor: 
To the Guardian and aU UCSD 

students, faculty and alumni who 
oppose apartheid and racism: 
Damnouth College needs your 
help. Some of the students here 
are making a valiant effort to 
protest these crimes against 
humanity, but they are being 
drowned in a sea of apathy, 
inaction and now. violence. Like 
our own UC system, Dartmouth 
College also has a substantial 
amount of money invested in 
South Afnca. And also like our 
system, the student population 
there IS calling for a divestment 
of these funds because they do 
not want to support racist 
murder. 

Unlike our UC system, 
however, the majority of people 
at Damnouth are silent. They are 
waiting for someone else to make 
a change. They need to be 
shown that we, as students, as 
conscientious members of our 
society, can make a difference. 
Our lives and futures are at stake 
here. 

On Tuesday morning, Jan. 28, 
around 3 am, the "shanties," 
Darunouth's method of 
protesting apartheid , were 
maliciously and violendy 
destroyed by 12 students 
widding sledge-hammers, who 
are members or a newspaper 
here. This act of racism ended 

what was otherwise a wonderful 
day of commemoration for Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr. 

What is incredibly 
unbelievable is that the students 
who were responsible for this 
violence do not realize the full 
extent of their actions. They 
stated that they were removing 
the shanties for the 
beautification of the campus. 
They have changed the already 
complicated issue of apartheid 
into a violent controversy that 
can only be seen as racism. 

The dean of the class of 1986 
of Dartmouth College, Dean 
Gregory Ricks. raised a good 
question, one that the faculty of 
this school must consider, "What 
kind of reputation IS Dartmouth 
making for itself and what kind 
of person would want to come 
here in the future?" Minoriry 
students, liberal students, and 
students with a conscience will 
not apply to thiS institution in 
the future and suffer from 
oppressive racism. 

Being a UCSD student and 
having participated in our 
protest movements against 
apartheid, I was apaUed to see 
how litde interest the students 
here have in this issue . I want to 
commend however, the students 
who are not silent, who are not 
bowing down to racism. 

They need your helr ' your 
support in the fonn 0 letters 
and prayers. They need to know 
they are not alone and that they 

can make a difference. Together 
we can continue to try and 
change the wrongs that we see 
in our world.

Editor: 
There sems to be a notion 

floating around that the smaller 
alternative media somehow 
approve of the media funding 
guidelines recently passed by the 
A.S. Council. I can't speak for aU 
the smaUer media, but I can 
speak for Sappho Speaks: we do 
not approve of these guidelines. 

The new gUidelines suffer from 

a number of practical flaws, and 
we find it hard to stomach the 
homogenization of modes of 
presentation ana the curtailing of 
free speech being passed off as 
"equality" and "opportunity." 

The new guidelines place 
production of twO 12-page issues 
per quarter as the ideal, the cost 
of which is purported to be 
S4,000. 

With one exception, the 
existing alternative media ha~ 
not complained about an 
"inequality" of funding. For our 
part , Sappho Speaks has no 
qualms about the proportionate 
distribution of monies. What the 
council fails to recognize is that 
differing levels of funding create 
different modes of presentation.

publish every two weeks, it will 
cease to function as an 
alternative news source capable 
of commentary on current issues 
as well as up-to-date 
presentation of issues not treated 
elsewhere. 

Instead of affecting events, the 
new indicator would be relegated 
to the role of after -the-fact 
exploration , Voz FronterillJ, now 
above the "desired" S4,000 limit, 
would also find itself stymied in 
its ability to respond to pressing, 
real-world events. Among many 
other examples, Voz Fronteri2JJ 
served as a mobilizer for protests 
against last year's shootings of 
border youths. 

Despite the A.S:s assertion 

that it does not wish to eliminate 
existing media, it seems to me 
that restricting the ntw indicator 
and VOl FronterillJ is tantamount 
to their destruction by severely 
limiting their unique and 
essential roles as interactors with 
the university and community at 
large. 

It may be surprising to hear 
this from a media substantially 
under. the S4,OOO level, but we 
do not necessarily see this as a 
desired level. In fact, we find the 
'notion of the A. S. legislating the 
"deSired level" insulting and the 
further specification of a two 12-
page issue schema 
presumptuous. In the first place, 
r know that Sappho Speaks has 
reached the limits of its current 
capabilities with one 12-page 
isssue per quarter, that the 
prospect for future expansion are 
dim, and that, in any case, we 
would prefer to expand to one 
16-page issue per quarter. Sappho 
S~alts specializes in in-depth 
coverage of complicated issues 
and would prefer to develop our 
format along those lines. 

In addition to these funding 
guidelines, the A. S. looks to the 
generation of advertising revenue 
as a panacea for funding 
problems. This is a mistaken 
notion. It is not good business to 
advertise in a paper which only 
has 6,000 copies and publishes 
infrequently. We owe our 
advertising revenue to the

A blueprint for 
parking 

By TOM COMEY 
Student parking is an old 

problem at UCSD and is growing 
worse . The problem lies much 
deeper than the fact that UCSD's 
undergraduate enrollment grows 
by more than 500 students per 
year and with them come their 
cars. The problem is that UCSD 
is creating new buildings on top . 
of old parking lots and not 
providing new places to park 
close to the new buildings. 

Not being able to park 
alongside N. Torrey Pines Road 
at the beginning of 1987 is just 
the proverbial "tip of the 
iceberg." Plans for the future 
include the University Center, 
designed to handle the various 
needs of the students at UCSD. 
It will be an ultra-modem 
structure but will have no 
parking. 

The University is growing by 
leaps and bounds with new 
programs being ushered in with 
huge grants. Top scientific minds 
from around the world are being 
attracted to UCSD to work but 
this could soon change. tn the 
very near future , parking will be 
a problem for staff as well as 
students. 

The probability of a Nobel 
Laureate willing to walk 10 an 
overflow parking lot everyday is 
very slim. 

One possible solution favored 
by the administration is locating 
student parking on the east side 
of 1-5. Some might say that is a 
very long walk but the 
administration is prepared to go 
the extra distance .and create a 
tram system. 

Similar to Disneyland's system, 
trams would, on a regular 
schedule, make the rounds 
through campus and wind up 
eventually at these satellite 
parking lots. "Satellite" is an 
accurate deSCription because 
there is nothing nearby the lots, 
and they are a considerable 
distance from the campus. Also, 
parking structures would be 
constructed over some existing 
lots (which at that time will be 
very few.) 

Not to be construed as a 
solution to the problem, but in 
some academic institutions back 
east, much more repressive 
means have been taken to ease 
their parking problems. 

For example, underclassmen 
have the least priority when it 
comes to finding parking space . 
While in others, freshmen 
students are simply not allowed 
to park their vehicles on campus. 
This is a sad but true reality in 
places where money and space 
are not accomodating, which is 
not the case here at UCSD. 

Fortunately for students and 
staff, there is a cheaper and 
more effective means to settle 
this problem. [ propose that 
measure be taken to create 
centralized , multi-level parking 
structures. This is the only viable 
solution. No longer would 
students be forced to walk great 
distances to get to class. This is 
a much safer proposition than 
riding a tram at night to a 
remote , desolate lor. 

Instead of spending millions 
of doUars on an unnecessary 
tram system, we could build as 
maDY parking structures as 
necessary. Each structure should 
be limited to about 1,000 
vehicles in order to be safe 
against an eanhquake. Financing 
such a project would be 
considerably less than what it 
would cost to create a tram 
system and instead of spending 
80 percent of the parking permit 
revenues on patrolling lots and 
issuing tickets, this amount could 
be reduced to a more reasonable 
percentage. Multi-level parking 
structures would be easily 
accessible, safe, and cost 
effective. With some road 
widening and even a traffic light 
or two, traffic in peak hours 
could quietly dissipate. It would 
seem that the administration 
would like to have a dreamy, 
pie-in-the-sky solution to the 
parking problem but practicality 
and need are more in line with 
centralized parking struCtures at 
UCSD. ~

I agree with the editorial that, 
in the past, not much thought 
was given to environmental 
protection , but attitudes have 
been changi ng before man went 
into space . However, I fail to see 
the connection between 
environmental awareness and 
manned space flight. The 
editorial seems to say that 
because we have failed to clean 
up our planet, the space shuttle 
exploded, as if some unseen 
force reached out to set the 
cosmic balance. The idea that 
Johnny has to clean up his room 
before he can go out and play is 
not applicable. There are direct 
and sometimes indirect benefits 
of space exploration that are 
utilized here on Earth. Without 
them we on earth are worse off 
and are at fault for not exploring 
every possible mean to find 
solutions to our "earthly" 
problems.

The idea of placing everyone

Sappho Speaks will never get to

politics that go into the funding

to go through the funding

The rigidity of these guideline!

recognize the inevitable growth

and the possibility of increasing 
the money available to media as

Sappho Speaks rejects the new

After reading that I got the 
picture of a sentient space

Machines are simply that -
machines. The idea that 
machines get the best of men is 
as ludicrous as a driver urging

believing the car understands. 
There was no premeditation by 
the shuttle or its parts to fail on

nothing more . It is upsetting to 
be so viciously reminded that 
machines can be fatal to human, 
but that does not mean we 
should put them on the scrap

it does mean is that even more

Finally, there is the statement

in which it was written left me 
with the impression that the

Tuesday's disaster because it will 
pop our children's foolish dream 
and bring them back to Earth. 
This Ptolemaic stance is a 
potentiaDy dangerous one, and it 
brings back memories of a time 
when scientific discoveries we~ 
considered heresy - look what

Responsible drinking 

Editor: 
There is a major flaw in Janice 

Hayward's article on alcohol and 
drunk driving (Guardian, 
2/3/ 86). Janice shoukl research 
her facts before making 
suggestions concerning the 
Triton Pub's monies. The Triton 
Pub has nothing to do with TG's 
and is notfunded by UCSD. 

In fact, it works the other way 
around. The Pub is privately 
owned by Ed and Maryanne 
Davis. Staffing, food costs, labor, 
utilities and most equipment 
maintenance and repair costS are 
the responsibility of the Pub 
owners. Ten percent of aD gross 
receipts come back to the 
students through the Student 
Center Board. This amounts to 
between $3,000 and $5,000 
monthly. 

The Davises own their own 
beer and wine license and are 
subject to aU laws under the 
Alcoholic Beverage Control. 
IncidentaUy, the ABC has 
steadfastly refused this same 
license to any University of 
California campus or student 
body organization. 

We feel that it is in our 
interest as well as the students' 
to support responsible drinking. 

Perhaps someone from the 
Guardian will do a stoty about us 
and clear up some common 
misconceptloons concerning the 
Triton Pub.

ReselVations about Council Travel 
By CHERYL CARlWRIGHT, Staff Writer 

SEVERAL UCSD students nearly lost their money last year when they purchased 
tickets through Council Travel on 
campus for a package deal 
offered by a Mexican tour 
company, Sunseekers, that went 
out of business. 

Students planning to travel 
should take several precautions 
and possibly insurance against 
losing moner paid for airplane 
tickets, hote rooms, and food 
offered in package deals. 

Students Karen james and 
Kenny Reuben charged a 
Thanksgiving 1985 vacation to 
Cancun and Cozumel, Mexico, 
offered by Sun seekers through 
Counc il Travel. 

Plane tickets and hOlel 
accomodations for two were 
covered by $846.00. The 
students chllrged the tickets at 
Council Travel on Nov. 14, 1985, 
for a flight scheduled to leave 
from Tijuana on Nov. 29, 
according to James. Sunseekers 
went out of business on the 
26th, three days before the trip. 
Council Travel reimbursed James, 
Rueben and another stranded 
couple on Dec . 9. Only these two 
couple were affected by the 
business failure, said Marlie 
Days, manager of Council Travel. 

When James and Reuben went 
to pick up their airplane tickets, 
Council Travel told them that 

Sunseekers had gone out of 
business and the students had 
lost all of their money. Initially, 
they were told that they could 
get no compensation: not 
another trip, nOl even the cost of 
the plane tickets, said James. 

"Council Travel IS not a good 
business. They should not even 
be on c~mpus . We did not get 
good service at all, and their 
rates aren't even that good," said 

James in a jan. 28 interview. 
However, Council Travel acts 

only as an intermediary and is 
not legaDy responsible for the 
"travel wholesaler" or the tour 
and package companies with 
whom they have made contracts. 
Council Travel refunded James 
and Reuben out of Council 
Travel money in order to 
maintain their good reputation 
on campus, even though they 
were not legally required to, said 
Days. 

Acting as an intermediary, the 
travel agency does not retain the 
customer's money. The money 
passes on to the tour wholesaler. 
Sometimes the travel agent 
retains the payment for the 
airline tickets, said 
H.G.McKenzie, president of the 
American Society of Travel 
Agents. In such a case, the 
traveler may possibly take the 
trip bUI lose the accomodations 
and guided lours, 

"We have a personal 
responsibility to maintain our 
reputation and service clients as 
best we can. Council Travel was 
more than expedient under even 
normal conditions in refunding 
the money lost to Sunseekers. 
They Games and Rueben) 
received a full refund by check 
on Dec. 9. Normal refunds take 
two to three weeks," said Days in 
a Feb 4 interview. 

"The travel agent has to be 
very careful in choosing the tour 
companies they deal with . 
Council Travel looks for the 
company's good reputation, 
financial stability, and longevity," 
said Days. "But who reaDy knows 
a company's financial stability? It 
can be difficult to know when a 
tour guide is experiencing 
financial difficulties." 

Sunseekers had been a very 
reputable company that had 
been in business for some time. 

Amigo Tours, another large 
tour company of long standing, 

.went legally bankrupt in late 
1984. One client of Council 
Travel lost money at that time, 
but Days said the money was 
refunded in that case also, even 
though the travel agency was not 
legaUy liable. 

"It is difficult to predict where 
or which tour companies will go 
out of business," McKenzie said. 
"The Mexican market especially 
has to be watched , but Hawaiian 
and Middle Eastern groups do as 
well . 

A traveler mayor may not be 
able to sue if the company goes 
bankrupt, McKenzie said. Under 
Chapter 11 , a company is 
allowed to reorganize, and 
customers are not allowed to sue 
until a time specified by a judge. 
Companies in bankruptcy under 
Chapter 7 liquidate their assets 
to payoff suers. However, 
generaDy, travel agencies do not 
have very much equipment or 

furnitu~ to sell to reimburse 
their customers. Such law suits 
are usually for under $1,500 in 
order to be heard in small claims 
court. 

Travel agents are not legally 
required to inform evety 
customer of travel insurance , said 
Days, although notices and 
insurance advertisements are 
conspicuously on display. 
Offering the insurance is 
optional. However, Council 
Travel initiated a new automated 
system which includes an 
attached form offering each 
cliem travel insurance. 

A suggested consumer 
disclosure notice constructed by 
attorney Alexander Anolik in the 

travel magazine TA-West says, 
"(NAME of AGENCy) is acting as 
an intermediary and agent for 
suppliers ('principals' identified 
on the attached or 
accompanying documents) in 
selling services, or in accepting 
reservations or bookings for 
services which are not directly 
supplied by this travel agency 
(such as air carriage, hotel 
accomodations, ground 
transportation, meals, tours, 
cruises, etc.). This agency, 
therefore, shaD not be 
responsible for breach of 
contract or any intentional or 
careless actions or ommissions 
on part of such suppliers, . . , 

"Traveler is hereby warned of 
such risks, and is advised to 
obtain appropriate insurance 
coverage against them." 

"You get what you pay for, and 
this is particularlr true in the 
travel business. I you pay a 
ridiculously low price, you can 
expect to receive poor service 
and higher risk ," said McKenzie. 

"Most importantly, take out 
'travel insurance' or 'travel guard' 
against losing your moner should 
a tour company go out 0 
business," suggest McKenzie. 
"Look for an established 
company which has been in 
business for several years. Some 
agencies have a CTC or Certified 
Travel Consultant who has had 

at least four years of travel 
school. 

"Look for agencies listed with 
a travel trade association. ASTA 
is the largest travel trade 
association covering 20,000 
travel agents, airlines, tour guides 
and cruise ships in 130 
countries. Agencies listed with 
ASTA tend to be less likely to 
fail ," said McKenzie. 

ASTA can tell a perspective 
traveler if anything negative or 
positive has been reported about 
a particular agency or if a 
company has gone out of 
business. 

Other insurances often are 
wise. Baggage insurance 
reimburses for lost or damaged 
luggage. Right interuption 
insurance pays for a hotel room 
and expenses incurred should a 
traveler miss a connecting 
international flight. Life and 
disability insurances provide 
compensation in event of an 
airplane or train crash, Cruise 
lines often offer similar insurance 
packages. The extra money spent 
may provide peace of mind, said 
McKenzie. 

"Council Travel is vel)' good," 
said Dana Winter, a Third 
College student, "They go out of 
their way to get the cheapest 
place because they know that 
you don't have lots of extra 
money to throw away." ~ 

Assembly to review Anti-Apartheid bill 
By MARIKO TAKAYASU, Sacramento Corresponcknt 

SACRAMENTO - A bill that 
would prohibit new University Of 
California and other state 
pension fund inveslments in 
companies doing business in 
South Africa won approval from 
the Assembly Ways and Means 
Committee Monday night. 

The measure would affect 
future public trust funds , 
including the university'S 
retirement system funds , that 
have stock holdings in 
companies doing business'in the 
radicaUy troubled country, said 
Assemblymember Maxine Waters, 
D-Los Angeles, the bill's author. 

The state's pension funds have 
more than $10.2 billion invested 
in companies doing business in 
the country, including the $2.4 
billion the university has 
invested. 

Waters has been a leading 
opponent of apartheid and has 
for several years authored similar 
legislation. 

"The conditions have 
worsened in South Africa," 
Waters said . "The economic 
situation has been deteriorating. 
The South African regime is 
more oppressive than ever." 

Waters said the subject of 
apartheid will not go away and 
California should join other 
states, including New jersey and 
New Mexico, ' to strike a blow for 
freedom and vote for 
divestment. " 

Opponents of the measure, 
however, including the California 
Manufacturer's Association , say 
nothing the state does with its 
pension funds will change 
current practices in South Africa. 

Waters' bill is exactly the same 
as one she wrote last year. Gov. 
George Deukmejian , however, 

vetoed the bill because it went 
too far in setting standards on 
state pension funds. 

Administration spokesperson 
Dick Ray told the committee the 
governor is opposed to the bill 
which "needs to be amended in 
totahl)' to prescribe 10 the 
Sullivan principles," a code of 
conduct in which companies 
agree to improve the quality of 
life for South African blacks. 

Deukmejian, instead of signing 
Water's bill last year, issued an 
executive order asking public 
state pension fund officials to 

abide by the university'S review 
of companies' conduct in the 
country by using the guidelines 
set forth in the Sullivan 
principles. 

The universtity has recently

Embarking on Chinese New Year ·with ••• 
The Lucky Lion Dance 
By EVA WONG, SlaffWrilcr 

T HE DRUMS ARE BEATING slowly and monotonously . ... 
Suddenly, with a loud crash of 
the cymbals, a man wearing a 
pink, round mask with a smile 
stretching from ear-to-ear, 
representing a Buddha (a 
Chinese monk) appears, 
bouncing into the crowd. He 
skips around energetically 
waiting for his "playmate." At the 
soun.d of another loud crash of 
the cymbals, the Buddha's 
playmate, the lion, appears. 

The lion is painted in multi-
colored hues of red , pink, gold 
and green, and is decorated 
elaborately With satin smngs, 
fringes and tassels. Its head IS 
made of papier-mache and 
wood, wah a ferocIOUS face that 
has winking eyes. Its body, 
attached by a red ribbon, is a 
long piece of Silken material. 

position of the body can be 
done by anyone of the dancers 
for more than a few minutes, 
because the legs tire from 
crouching, or the arms give from 
moving the head to the beat of 
the drums. It takes synchronized 
teamwork to bring the lion alive, 
because the performers have to 
switch positions frequently 

Another guard the lion has 
against evil is a mirror on the 
lion's forehead - if any evil 
spirits confront it, they see their 
own horrible reflection and are 
frightened away. 

In a performance of the Lion 
Dance, the visual impact begins 
with the entrance of the multi-
colored beast, but the real 
excitement comes from the 

stanlin~ acrobatics and athletics 
done by the nimble lion, as it 
dodges the live firecrackers 

The ~ommunity's Help 
By EVA WONG, Slaff Wrilcr 

W HAT ORIGINALLY began as a small street fair in 1983 
for people of Chinese descent, in 
the hean of San Diego's 
Chinatown on Third Avenue and 
Market Street, has grown into a 
grand-scale celebration involving 
all of the San Die~o community. 

"'ccordin~ to Ming Leung, a 

member of UCSD's Asian-Pacific 
Student Alliance (APSA) and 
coordinator of volunteers from 
UCSD for this year's event , the 
predicted attendance at the 
Chinese Social Service Center's 
(CSSC) Fourth Annual Chinese 
New Year Food and Cultural 
Faire is expected to be well over 
outreach. We would like to do 

The lion, followmg the teasing 
monk, enters the crowd of 
people , with as enonnous head 

swayin~ from side to side. The 
Buddha tempts the lion with a 
head of lettuce, and the hon 
stalks him like a cat playing with 
a ball of yam. The lion 
sometimes ignores it, and at 
other times playfully kicks or 
bi tes at it. 

, Brian Tuey, a Lucky Lion Dancer poses by a young-style lion 's head (left), and Ming Ltung (right) oj the Asian-PaCific Student Alliance. 

As the lion pauses to scratch 
himself, the Buddha dances to 
the music of drums and cymbals, 
without missing a beat. At last, 
the lion gets the lettuce head 
away from the monk, as it 
dodges .exploding firecrackers 
thrown at its feet. 

It devours the btuce with 
such ferociry that pieces fly from 
its mouth and into the crowd. 
The people of the crowd 
suddenly disperse and try to 
reach out and grab for a piece of 
the flying lettuce, because it 
ensures good luck for the rest of 
the year. 

The lion , itself inanimate, is 
usually brought to life by four or 
five teenage boys. But today, it 
isn't exacdy unheard of to have 
girls play the head, body or tail 
of the lion, though it is strenuous 
work to bring it alive . Strong legs 
are needed for this highly 
stylized method of celebration, 
which incorporates Kung-fu like 
stances and Chinese folk 
dancing. Strong arms are 
required to operate the "swaying" 
motion of the head which 
weighs between 15 to 20 
pounds. 

During the Lion Dance, no 

during the dance. 
Each dancer has to know how 

to do at least one other pan -
whether playing the cymbals or 
drums, which is no easy task , 
or operating a section of the 
lion's body. An alternative is to 
have extra dancers, so one can 
rest during a segment of the 
exhausting dance which 
sometimes lasts upwards of half 
an hour. 

The Lion Dance is usually 
performed on or after the 
Chinese New Year, which occurs 
on February 9 this year. This 
dance is done at Chinese 
peoples' residences, restaurants 
and other Chinese 
establishments celebrating the 
New Year fest ively, warning olf 
evil spirits. 

According to Chinese 
mythology, the lion was 
mischievous and caused trouble 
in heaven, so the Jade Emperor 
cut off its head and threw the 
head and body down to Earth. 
Kwan Yin , the goddess of mercy, 
seeing the poor animal suffering, 
tied the lion back together with 
an enchanted red ribbon. The 
red ribbon empowers the lion 
with the ability to frighten away 
evil spirits.

thrown at its feet from the 
sidelines. This spectacular sight 
in celebrating Chinese New Year 
with the Lion Dance has become 
a tradition in San Diego, which 
has been passed down from the 
ancient times of China.

~OfI the top 
By SEAN WAGSTAFF 

When Katy was crowned homecoming queen in a black velvet 
dress, black gloves up to her elbows and black high heels, no one 
was really surprised. Five-foot-eight out of her heels with gigantiC 
blue eyes and a shock of yellow hair, she would easily have been the 
prettiest girl in school if she had been wearing a potato sack and 
hiking boots. But in that dress, slit up to the eyeball of every boy at 
the game, she was truly spectacular. Her competition, in frilly white 
fluff must have been embarrassed. 

Th~ only punk in a crowd of cow-jocks and future fratboys of 
Amenca, Katy knew a lot about breaking rules without worrying 
about getting caught. She was preny sure we would all be blown up 
soon and she tried to do everything she could to get off before she 
got out. 

After high school, she went off to college to learn French, but her 
father, a notorious S.O.B., cut her money off, so she quit and got a 
Job dehverIng pIzzas. Her mother died when she was a ~id . 

The last time I saw Katy, she was living in a hole of an apartment 
in Berkeley, directly upstairs from the California Girls Massage 
Parlor. There were a pot pipe and mirror on the table , empty beer 
cans stacked into a six-foot pyramid in a comer, dirty dishes 
everywhere , and a very incoherent, ratty looking man on the couch. 
The gigantiC blue eyes were puffy and red and the si lky blonde hair 
had aU been shaved olf except for a palm-sized patch on one side. 

"How are you?" I asked, not really prepared for any answer she 
might give. 

"I'm happy," she said . 
I was staying at my aunt s house one weekend and the family was 

sitting at the dmner table , My lJ·year-old cousin , Vivian , was 
dressed \0 a tight black, sleeveless dress, black ftshnet stockings, 
black shoes, and black jewelry, (except for a couple of pot metal dog 
chains). She had on black fingernail poish , and over a white-
powdered face , a ton of black mascara and black eyeliner which 
ri nged her eyes and streaked off to a pOint, somewhere near her 
ears . Her once shiny chestnut haIr was died jet black and teased 
into a tremendous rat's nest on the one half of her head wh ich had 
not been shaved to a fuzzy approximation of baldness.

more work with the community, 
but it's a difficult task because 
UCSD's so far removed from the 
ciry where things happen; it 
takes effon. APSA believes that 
it's a worthwhile cause for a 
potpourri of people to meet and 
learn from each other and to 
work together towards one 
common goal, as this celebration 
does." 

Leung continues, "Not only is 
this a fun activity for everyone to 
celebrate , but also to learn from. 
~he utilizing San Diego's Asian 
communities' rich resources by 
working with San Diego's 
Chinese community leaders. 
We're helping in all phases of 
the fair, and we're also learning 
of our own heritage, as well as 
what it means to be an Asian-
American in today's society. It's 
both eXCiting and a chaRenge to 
familiarize the intergroup 
differences among Asians to 
other Asians and to the general 
public." 

The proceeds from this event, 
celebrating the Chinese Lunar 
year 1684, will benefit the 
Chinese Social Service Center, 
which is a non-profit 
organization servicing the needs 
of the greater San Diego 
community. 

In addition to this cultural 
event, csse has also sponsored 
other cultural affairs in San 
Diego. One such event in which 
the Center was instrumental was 
the Golden Monkey Exhibit at 
the San Diego Zoo laSt year and 
the Panda Preservation Fund. 

Accordin~ to Mary Lou Hom, 
one of the people who has been 
a part of organizing the fair 
since its conception , 
"preparations for thIS year's 
celebration of the Year of the 
Tiger began soon after last year's 
fair ended , the Crosby Hall 
where the event takes place this 
year had to be booked a year in 
advance. By October (of 1985) all 
the derails were set."

two basic methods used - the 
free style , where the dancers 
improvise and make up the 
dance as they go along, and the 
set method, where the steps are 
pre-arranged and choreographed 
with specific music and beat.

restaurants during the Chinese

there are two girls who play the 
cymbals and a set of the drums,

the mid-lOs. They wear the 
traditional blac~ pants, Kung-fu

Chinese good luck symbols. Red

they are caUed, practice aU year

demonstrations of calligraphy 
and a martial arts display done 
by locally and internationally 
acclaimed matial artist Sam 
Kuoha,.and his students, who 
will be demonstrating traditional 
forms of the art as well as light-
hearted choreographed skits. 

The Lion Dance is most 
appropriate in bri nging in the 
Year of the Tiger because the 
year of the Tiger marks a 
definitely explosive year. 
According to the legends of the 
12 animals of the lunar calendar, 
the tiger symbolizes power and 
passion. Because this animal is 
characterized as being rebellious, 
colorful and unprediclable, the 
tiger commmands not only awe 
and respect, but also fear. During 
this y~ar, everything good and 
bad will supposedly be carried to 
extremes. 

The Fourth Annual Chinese 
New Year Food and Cultural 
Faire win be held at the Del Mar 
Fairgrounds on February 8 and 9 
and will be open to the public 
from 11 am to 8 pm on Saturday, 
and 11 am to 6 pm on Sunday .~ 

into this daring and dangerous 
activity involving exploding 
fireworks. 

The Lion Dance often seen in 
American Chinatowns, is also 
referred to the as the Southern 
Lion, where people crouch under 
the piece of cloth representing 
its body. There is also the 
Northern or Peking IJon Dance, 
where the dancers have to be of 
a specific size to fit into a 
uniform. 

There are two different types 
of Southern Lions, the Old and 
the Young. The Old Lion , the 
multi-colored one with a white 
beard, is a trademark of an 
established school of dance, 
which is the type usuaUy seen 
performing. The Young Lion is 
black with a fuzzy beard, 

Let 
'em ., 
know 
you C/ 
care ••• 

The Lucky Lion Dancers use 
the free style method , which is 
harder for the drummer, because 
the drummer has to anticipate 
the lion 's actions and match the 
music to the movement of the 
dancers. 

The main idea to be conveyed 
in the Lion Dance, is to imitate 
as closely as possible the actions 
of the mammal itself. If the 
person playing the head is seen 
twistIng or jerking when he 
moves his leg to scratch or wipe 
the mouth of the lion head it 
could give him away as an ' 
amateur dancer to expert 
eyes.

T HE 1986 ME '5 AND women's swim teams went [0 Kenyon College in OhIO 
last weekend [0 prove a thing or 
two to last year's national 
champs. The women, by vinue of 
their two-point vic[Ory over· 
Kenyon College, 62-60, cenainly 
established themselves as one of 
the [Op teams in the nation . The 
men didn't do so badly either,

Volleyball setting a 
mark for itself 
By TOM FERGUSON, Slaff WriUY 

T HE UCSD MEN'S volleyball team proved themselves a force to be 
reckoned with against tough 
schools this past weekend at the 
UCSB/ Michelob Collegiate 
Invitational, accomplishing a 
major goal that they had set 
before the tournament to finish 
In the [Op seven (UCSD was 
11th last year). The Tritons 
finished ahead of teams that, 
according [0 coach Digger 
Graybill, "people would expect to 
finish ahead of us." These teams 
Included Long Beach State and 
Loyola-Marymount, both strong 
Divison I teams. 

The following is a wrap-up of 
the UCSB tourney: UCSD came 
mto the tournament with a 2-1 
record and quickly upped it to 
4-1 by beating UC Berkeley 15-7 , 
15-9, and Humboldt State , 15-13, 
15-8. The Tritons then lost one 
and won one before losing three 
in a row [0 BYU, Univerisity of 
Winnepeg (Canada) and CSUN. 
UCSD then defeated 51. Mary's 

College (a Div. I team that they 
beat earlier in the season) 15-6, 
15-6 to win the seventh place 
championship and gain a 6-5 
record . 

UCSD's record after the 
tournament is 6-5 . The Tri[Ons' 
play has not gone unnoticed . 
Southern California coaches 
voted UCSD 17th out of 20 
schools In Southern California 
(they were 18th last week). 
Loyola remained m the 
#16 slot ahead of UCSD (by twO 
points), but placed behind them 
in the UCSB tournament. 

ThiS week they will 
face SDSU (Wednesday) and 
Loyola (Friday - the home 
opener). Cherry said that if they 
defeat SDSU , who was ranked 
# 1 I , the Tritons could be in the 
top 15. Whatever {he outcome, 
look for a great match between 
# 16 Loyola and # 17 UCSD at 
the home opener Friday at 
7:30pm at the Triton 
Pavillion. ~ 

Golfers finish 13th 
By DA YID TEDROW, Staff Wntrr 

T HE UCSD MEN'S GOLF team placed 13th in the 54-hole USIU Invitational 
at San Luis Rey Country Club 
this past Monday and Tuesday. 
The Tritons' total of 1194 was 
well behmd the leaders, but It 
was the best score a non-
scholarship school posted. 
Overall , the University of Nevada 
at Reno finished first with an 
1113, followed by Cal State Long 
Beach and San Diego State. 

The Tritons were led by Pat 
Weishan who shot a 73-74-79, 
226, placing him in a tie for 
11 th place overall. Following 
Weishan for UCSD were Mike 
O'Laughlin - 235, "Buddy" Lea 
- 238, Brad Sterling - 246, 
and Joost Steenkamer - 253. 
Steenkamer's score would have 
been much better had he not 
shot a qUintuple-bogie to on the 
12th hole of hiS final round . 

What's the Dutch word lor 
quintuple-bogie? 

The scores for all the learns 
were relatively high in this 
tourney because the golfers were 
forced to play 54 holes in only 
twO days. However, more 
and more tourneys are moving to 
this format due to the NCAA's 
new 30 day rule . Thai is, no 
team may play more than 30 
days of compemion during the 
season. So on days they do play, 
Ihe teams want 10 gel in as many 
holes as they possibly can; 
hence, 54 holes In twO days 
Instead of the more traditional 
36. 

UCSD Will play Iheir first 
match agamst DIVISion III 
competit ion Tomorrow they play 
Whittier College In Friendly 
Hills , and on Monday they travel 
to Arrowhead to pl'IY Cal Stale 
an Bernadmo. [W 

and three-meter boards. 
Overall, Morgan was optimistic 

about UCSD's performance. "The 
women really helped themselves 
in regard to the Nationals," he 
said , "Our depth there really 
helps. As for the men , they excell 
in the dual meets." Morgan felt 
that this was due in pan to the 
lack of depth on the men's team. 
"We've got great individual 
swimmers, but in the Nationals 
you need a lot of team depth . If 
you finish first but they finish 
second and third all the time, it's 
going 10 catch up with you." 

Morgan was also pleased with 
the Kenyon meet because of the 
calibre of the competition. 
"Kenyon is the model orol!ram 
(Kenyon has computerized 
resultS for all its swimmers). 
Considering that we're stilfjust 
trying to find a way to pay our 
coaches, I think we did a 
commendable job." 

The swim team took assistant 
Athletic Director Mike Hipp 
along with them to "show him 
what we're up against. We 
wanted someone from the 
depanment to see what could be 
done with the proper facilities 
and enough money," Morgan 
said , "We wanted to show that 
we have the deck stacked against 
us with regards to the swimming 
program." The Tritons will face 
Pomona Pitzer this Saturday at 
Canyonview, beginnin~ at 
11 am. ~

Crusaders. ·We were really 
swi nging the ball well ," said 
UCSD assistant coach , Don 
Elder, ·We gOl some good shots 
In the game." Evidence of this 
came from the Tritons' balanced 
scoring. Three players scored in 
double figures , led by Shanda 
Elzy's 14 points. 

Point Lorna was vinually a one 
woman show. Ann Duffy 
displayed some Magic-Worthy 
moves as she poured in 26 
points. 

The rest of the team, however, 
would have made James 
Naismith, the father of basketball , 
scream m agony. As 
fundamentally unsound as any 
team can be , the cold CruS<lders 
tried a varied amay of dlpsy

freshman pitcher Rich Nowak lasted 5 before liring in Ihe sixth againsl USD 

Four run ninth leaves 
UC grasping for draw 
By JOHN SCHACHT, Sportl Etfj,Of" 

W ITH TWO OUTS IN the ninth , a runner at first and a 8-4 lead 
against Division I crosstown rival 
USD, you'd figure the 1986 
Tritons would have the game 
sewn up. Three walks and a 
bases-clearing double by USD's 
Robbie Rogers later, you'd have 
been wrong. Tuesday afternoon 
UCSD blew that four-run lead 
and had to settle for a 8-8 tie, 
bringing their '86 record to I-I-
I. 

The Tritons jumped out to an 
early lead as Bob Natal initiated 
Olsen field's new scoreboard 
with a two-run poke to the left , 
cashing in one of the four walks 
on the day that leadoff man 
Dave Stanovich collected. Natal 
also drove in the go-ahead run 
in UCSD's five-run scventh with 
a single to left that scored 
newcomer Glen Turnipseed who 
had tripled in the Tritons' founh 
run . Natal went two for four on 
the day and is hitting a torrid 
.700 (7-10) with two home runs 
and seven rbi 's in UCSD's three 
games thus far. 

The Torreros took a 3-2 lead 
with three in the third before the 
Tritons countered with a Dan 
DiMascio rbi groundout to knot 
the score at three in the fifth . 

After staning freshman pitcher 
Rick Nowak walked the leadoff 
man in the sixth and gave up a 
foul home-run , coach Lyle Yates 
brought in righthander Paul 
Burke who wild/itChed the 
runner to secon where he 
scoTed on an rbi single . UCSD 
then exploded for a five-run 
seventh, Turnipseed , Natal, 
DiMascio, Derek A1konis and 
Don Petersen all picking up 
single rbi's. 

After a quiet eighth, the 
Torreros scored their four runs 
with the aid of a bad call. With 
one out and a runner on first, 
Burke induced a force out at 
second, When the runner slid 
out of the baseline, Yates and his 
team argued that a double play 
should be caUed. It wasn't -
although the home plate ump 
later admitted that he blew the 
call - and the Tritons' next 
pitcher, Terry Beck, walked in a 
run before Rogers' base-clearing 
double. . 

UCSD had anOther 
opponunity to win the game in 
the ninth, but failed to capitalize 
on a bases loaded, no out 
situation. Three straight walks 
put Tritons at every base, but 
pinch hitter Mitch Tucker 
grounded into a force at home, 
Stanovich, struck out after a 
disputed 3-0 strike, and Don 
Petersen gOt caught in a 
rundown off third on a pitch in 
the din. 

"Even though we're a Division 
III school and they (U5D) are 
Division I, I felt we had the 
better team," said Yates, "and 
that's why it 's such a tough loss. 
With a four-run lead and two 
down in the ninth, you keep 
thinking every next pitch is 
going to be the ball game .. But it 
wasn't. FundamentaUly we just 
made too many mental mistakes 
and couldn't find the strike zone 
when we needed to." 

UCSD will take on Division III 
rival Claremont-Mudd/ Scripps 
this Friday in the official home 
opener - a doubleheader at 
Olsen field beginning at noon. 
Padres second baseman Tim 
Flannery will throw Out the firsl

With the bmh of February come a enes of annual events that are known around town as

ThIS year's competition will undoubtedly' feature some of UCSD's fi ne t athlete ever to

----All-Campus 
Racquetball Tourney 

Marry Hogan and Dave Peck better start 
looking over their shoulders. UCSD obViously 
has been producing more than just doctors and 
lawyers. Seems we are putting out some pretty 
fair racquetball players also. One of those who 
definitely qual ifies as a future "pro" is one Todd 
Swanson. It was obvious after watchi ng him 
destroy the competition that the library is not 
the only place on campus he frequents. The 
Canyonview racquetball couns seem to be his 
second home. He knows every crack and "hole" 
in those walls. 

It was scary as Todd barely worked up a 
sweat In the early rounds. But the fi nal 
promised to be a tougher match. He would face 
the p ride of Warren , assistant resident dean, 
Monte Broaded. Monte took more time to 
thrash his opponents, but the results were the 
same. 

The standing room only crowd was all set for 
a titanic match in the final. Eight minute later 
the standmg room only crowd was head 109 fqr 
the nearest exit as the match wa; over. The 
scores were 11-0, 11 -4 indicating Todd was 
obviously In a class by hImself. Monte barely 
knew what happened and It was over 

Todd graduates thIS quaner on to the pro 
racquetball tour As for Monte Broaded he 
hopes next year he will make hIS third VISIt to 
the final more pleasant than the first two.

Go for Godot 
You saw it in the movies, remember? The poor children of the 

neighborhood, struggling to put on a school show, burnt cork on their 
white minstrel faces, Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney and Donald 
Duck. Somehow, they got 'it together. They must be nuts. Worse -
they're actors, they'll do anything to get out there and tread the boards. 
And, somehow, they get the hall for those few nights and their lights go 
on, for better for worse, for richer or for poorer, they are married to the 
greasepaint and the power of making believe. 

C'mon. it's just another play. Well, yes, but his is different. They're 
doing it on their own. This Hiatus theater jerk sat in on a dress rehearsal 
Monday night. and it looks like the Underjfaduate Theatre Makers will 
be ready for their opening tonight, with a performance of Samuel 
Beckett's masterwork, Waiting far Gxiot, as directed by Arthur Salazar. 
The show will run in Mandeville Recital Hall, for ·four nights, tonight 
through Sunday, Feb. 9. Curtain is at 8 pm, tickets are $3, available at the

Barking up the 
by lean waptaff 

Standing in the eucalyptus grove, 
leaning against a fine old tree, I am 
reminded that nature's work is 
seldom less than perfect. Squinting 
up a the shining bark, I am reminded 
that artistic experimentation is also a 
good thing. But like so many good 
things in life, conflicts can arise 
between them. 

My fine old tree is covered with 
lead. It is a natural thing that could 
not have been m\JCh less than perfect 
before, but now that its naturalness 
is ruined, it is still a good thing. 

If the nuclear bomb drops some 
day, every living thing is probably 
doomed - even trees. But art may 
survive, though, like a tree falling in 
the woods with no one to hear it, 
we'll neVer know if it malcesa sound. 
And trees made of lead may survive, 
though the shimmering leaves of a 
livina tree are missing. 

Terry Allen's "singing trees" are 
It once repugnant because they 

stand out like exclamations on the 
human condition and furture of our 
earth, and at the same time, 
beautiful, because they are gentle 
reminders of the harmony between 
art and nature. 

The three eucalyptus trees were 
salvaged from the clear-cuttings of 
one of the many building sites on 
campus. The smaller branches were 
trimmed away and lead squares were 
hammered and nailed to cover the 
trees completely. Finally, they were 
transplanted in their permanent 
homes. 

One ' of the trees juts 
conspicuously out of a hill in front of 
the library; another is buried deep 
within a thicket of other trees, their 
branches and colors intermingling;· 
the third is neither conspicuous itlJ 
nor harmonious with the rest of the 
grove, but just stranaelv out of place 
among the living trees. 

One of the trees, like its living 
counterparts, II silent; another has a 
hidden speaker thatplavs poetry; the

• '1. 

third plays music. According to a 
description of the project by Allen, 
much of the music and poetry will b~ 
specially performed for the "trees," 
and will "blend into the ambient 
noise of the grove at a distance of 
about 40 feet." 

The voice of these trees is an 
important element of their impact. 
Italo Scanga, a colorful artist and 
professor at UCSO said, "I think the 
surprise of a tree that talks is 
wonderful." The "trees" are the 
latest gift of the Stuart Foundation 
which brought us the "La Jolla 
Project" ("Stonehenge") by Richard 
Fleischner, the untitled project 
("Purple Volleyball Net") by 
Robert Irwin, and of course, the 
"Sun God" by Niki de Saint Phalle. 

A description of the Stuart 
Collecion in the Library says its goal 
is to "integrate artistic thinking into 
the fabric of the campus and create a 
dialogue about the nature of artistic 
imagery and its potential for 

extension into the everyday physical 
and cultural environment." 

It is ironic that these radiadon~ 
proof trees were planted by the 
military when the university's land 
was part of Fort Mathews. But the 
trees are no more obviously a 
comment on the possibility of war 
than they are on man's exploitation 
of the environment and lack of 
respect for nature. 

There was, until recently, a place 
at the edge of the grove, where one 
could look (with a particularly fat 
tree obscuring peripheral vision in a 
tertain direction) without seeing a 
single human contrivance. Such 
sights are too rare to a country 
person. Hence, the first view of the 
slate-colored mockery of a living 
thing in the midst of a personal 
Walden was met with a certain sigh 
of distress. But sadness at the loss of 
a bit of wilderness to metal trees gave 

-way to relief that at least it was not, as 
Scanga put it, "for some compressor 
for atoms or something."

by daniel thoma. 

The Old Globe Theatre, 
located in San Diego's Balboa 
Park, is currently featuring a 
sl ightly off, beat play, 
Spokesong, with words and 
lyrics by Stewart Parker, 
music by Jimmy Kennedy, 
direction by Warner Shook. 
An engaging, heartfelt look 
into the world of a bicycle 
shopkeepe r in Be lfast, 
Northern Ireland, it is a show 
full o f human virtue , 
delightful music, excellent 
acting, wry humor and 
pathos. 

Contained within the story 
of the eccentric bicycle, 
mechanic is a capsule history 
of the bicycle itself, from the 
earliest modi £jed hobby 
horses, through the subse, 
quent velocipedes and on into 
the modern safety bicycle, as 
it was developed around the 
turn of the century. The play 

gains a great deal of grace and 
charm, not to mention energy 
and strength, from the 
bicycles which are continually 
being ridden around the stage 
by various characters. As 
Frank impresses his new, 
found girlfriend with his 
fanatical devotion to the 
history of bicycles, figures in 
historical garb ride past on 
bicycles of their times. 

We soon learn . how much 
Frank, the bicycle shop man, 
regrets that all this was swept 
aside by the sudden birth of 
the automobile, a develop, 
ment ·to which he refers with 
his line, "Our lives are at the 
mercy of alien machines." 
How much better we all 
would be, he claims, if we all 
rode bikes, machines which 
everyone can understand and 
appreciate. To hear him tell it,

The ruckus at Revelle 
By b.y. 

Musical rivalry was 
provoked Friday the 31st of 
January by the annual Revelle 
Battle of the Bands. Of the last 
four which I have attended, 
this one was the most 
paradoxical. An entertaining 
variety of bands played to a 
small crowd (1 would blame 
weak promotion). Both the 
bands and the sound systems 
had a good share of technical 
disasters. . 

The first group up on stage 
was Assorted Artists who 
used a drum machine 
programmed in techno,pop 
fashion to drive their young 
looks and faithful followers. It 
would have worked well had 
they remembered a few more 
of their chord changes. When 
they exchange a real drummer 
for one of their synth players 
and experience a few hostile 
audiences (like all bands 
should and eventually do) 
they will shape up. These 
young "artists" have potential 
and could control the high 
school dance circuit. 

have been two bands on one 
stage battling it out. Fan Club 
as a trio put out an excellent 

high~nergy show with their 
undeniably Jam,like sounds at 
last year's Battle. This band 
does gig around and has 
performed with such groups 
as the Three O'clock. 

The fourth band to 
perform, placing second in the 
competition, was the 
Alliance, a true San Diego 
band (that means one with a 
gimmick). They played high 
energy American,Roots 
styled tunes from X to CCR. 
Charismatic and clad in a tux,

Band #2, the Children's 
Hour, clearly adores the Cure. 
Though plagued with sound 
system hassles and an 
overdose of hair spray, they 
stuck to their guns . 
Melancholy and Psychedelia 
hinted at a band that, given 
time, could be quite unique in 
the local context. If their 
music was as tight as their 
leather pants and as smoking 
as their cigarettes, they could 
live up to their looks. These 
guys were a lot of fun to talk 
with. Do stay tuned for the 
Children's Hour. 

The Fan Cl{Jb played next

Still wheelin' falling into the front row laps. As Frank and his grand-parents both worked in the 
same shop, there is no need 
for extensive scene changes 
between flashbacks and 
"present" time. The changes 
between turn of the century 
past and 1970s present are 
clear, however, by virtue of 
excellent costumes that evoke 
both periods quite perfectly. 
Scenic and costume designer 
Robert Blackman deserves 
two rounds of applause for his 
double duty here. 

Continued from page .. 
Frank off the deep end, and 
into a very good drunk scene, 
complete with a full-size Irish 
leprechaun to help him get 
home. I won't tell you how it 
works out - there must be 
some suspense left for the 
audience, after all. 

Interspersed with the 
modem tale is the story of 
Frank's grandfather and 
grandmother, who were also 
bicycle fanatics, among the 
first, it seems . It was 
grandfather Francis who first 
opened the bicycle shop, and 
it was grandmother Kitty who 
moved in to keep shop with 
him, much the same way as 
Frank would have Daisy move 
in with him, two generations 
later, except that Daisy, a 
school teacher, does not want 
to bring any more children 
into the streets of war-torn 
Belfast. 

The grandparents ' court-
shrp scenes are marvelous 

pieces of flashback, and 
contribute greatly to the 
audience's understanding of 
how Frank could be like he is. 
His parents having beeen 
killed during the second 
world war, Frank and ' his 
adopted brother were raised 
by the grandparents. 

A particularly hilarious 
grandfather sequence involves 
Francis's term with the army 
in the first world war, as he 
attempts to learn how to stand 
at attention, salute the 
officers , present his 
equipment for inspection and 
shoot a rifle, all while riding or 
holding his army bicycle. 

All of this work is staged in 
a delightful; simple set, the 
interior of the shop, with a 
street scene behind, and plain, 
but not unartracative walls to 
left and right. The street curls 
around in front of the bicycle 
shop set, so the audience is 
treated to bicycles that zoom 
past, downstage center, nearly 

The lighting and sound, as 
designed by John B. Forbes 
and Corey L. Fayman, are also 
rather well done. Contrasting 
use of dim and bright lighting 
lends a smoothness to the 
movement of the play from 
past to present. The bomb 
effect is especially superb, and 
came off like a a real explosion 
had taken place, just offstage. 

The acting was very natural, 
in spite of the need to 
emphasize the difference 
between the two time periods.

OglesbY and Annabella Price)

were very believable, their 
idealism and their disap-

point~ent with the social 
relaity around them was 
evident in their walking, their 
posture, as well as in their 
dialogue. Brother Julian, an 
extremely cynical and rude 
sort of person, was tastefully 
played by Matt McKenzie, 
without any extremes of evil 
melodrama . His brutal 
comments about the departed 
grandparents were believable 
in spite of the meanness with 
which they were meant. 
Francis and Kitty, the 
grandparents, pia yed by 
Gregory Inin and Christine 
Healy, were delightful in their 
youth, and aged very well in 
one scene with Frank as a 
young man. 

There is one actor, 
however, who deserves

he plays, in fact, nearly a

stage with a different and 
believable personality each 
time, whether in the present 
or in the past. His name: 
Charles Hallahan. His role(s) 
are too many to list, but he . 
plays them all with flair, and 
helps to hold together the 
different people and times of 
the show, without ever 
hogging the stage. He becomes 
an encyclopedia of Irish 
character, without falling into 
any stereotypical traps or 
cliches. Bravo. Through his 
unifying and diverse 
personalities, he allows all the 
other players to shine even 
brilZhter. 

One ' final aspect of the 
show deserves comment and 
applause: the music . There isa 
good deal of singing and music 
making in the play, and it all 
works to good effect, 
heightening both the reality 
and the whimsy of Spokesong. 
The play .is, after all, the song 
of the Spokes. There is even a 
kind of musical quality to the 
way the many bicyclists spin 
across and about the stage.

Touch up 
by john nee 

Although it is only two 
hours away, Los Angeles, as 
far as music is concerned 
might as well be in New York. 
That is to say that nothing 
really ever happens in San 
Diego. Jazz is very popular 
here, and so are Dynasty and 
the Cosby Show. However, 
these are popular everywhere 
in the United States and the 
only thing that San Diego has 
unto itself that is popular is 
Tijuana, but that is in Mexico 
and therefore does not count. 

There are few clubs in San 
Diego that book good acts and 
none that will admit anyone 
younger than twenty-one. The 
concert scene is bleaker. 
Appearances of good groups 
in San Diego usually go 
unnoticed because local radio 
stations refuse to play the 
music of the bands being 

promoted. Promoters seem 
unwilling to do shows with 
new bands except to give them 
a token opening slot on an 
inconsitent bill. Hence, many 
bands bypass San Diego when 
considering a tour schedule 
simply because they do not 
receive adequate compensa-
tion or audience turnout for 
their performance. A few 
bands from LA that have been 
lucky enough to land on the 
HCutting Edge of Rock" 
format being touted by 91X 
have enjoyed relative success 
in San Diego (X, Oingo 
Boingo, Missing Persons, 
Berlin) however, their success 
was in many cases dubious 
and unwarranted while many 
other talented bands have 
gone by the way side. 

The Untouchables have run 
the full gamut of the Southern 
California music scene. They 

started when there was 
nothing but Stairway to 
Heaven and }(LOS and helped 
to create a movement. They 
became the house band of the 
Roxy in Los Angeles and 
would sell out every other 
weekend. It comes as no 
surprise that of all the bands 
in the Mod/Ska/Psyche 
movement (the Tfiree 
O'Clock, the Bangles, the 
Pandoras etc.), the Untouch-
ables have gained the most 
popularity in San Diego, 
despite the fact that they can 
only be very rarely heard on 
local radio. 

For a while, though, the 
popularity of the Untouch, 
abies waned. The LA music 
scene has died and moved to 
Austin and there were many 
casualties with this demise. 
However, just when they were 
beginning to lose ground in 
Southern California, the 
Untouchables became 
extremely popular in Britain 
and toured the UK during this 
past summer, returning 
stronger than when they had 
left.
