Students 
Hold 
Peaceful 
Protests

BY AYAN KUSARI
Staff Writer

Library Walk became a site of pro-
test, discussion and debate as student 
activists set up displays, staged march-
es and held speaker series’ in support 
of each side of the Israel-Palestine 
conflict last week.

Activists from the Muslim Student 
Association (MSA) and Students for 
Justice in Palestine (SJP) grouped their 
events in what they called “Justice 
in Palestine Week,” while Tritons for 
Israel (TFI) called its events “Israel 
Solidarity Week.”

The largest display on Library 
Walk was the visual representation 
of the Israeli West Bank Barrier, built 
out of large wooden panels by mem-
bers of SJP and the MSA. The wall 
was painted with statistics, graphs and 
images of the Israel-Palestine conflict. 
According to MSA member Omar 
Ahmad, it took three years and cost 
roughly $7,000 to build. 

Ahmad says that this year, the 
groups were careful to include sources 
for all the statistics on the wall at the 
bottom of the panels. 

“Many people don’t want to sup-
port us,” Ahmad said. “We want them 
to know that we’re not making this 
stuff up, out of the blue.”

MSA member Saad Yazdani said 
that local San Diego media outlets, 
like ABC and NBC 10, have tried to 
depoliticize the issue in their coverage 
of the events last week. 

“Justice in Palestine” and 
“Israel Solidarity” week 
on campus focused on 
human rights issues.

SUN GOD FESTIVAL 
HITS CAPACITY

BY NICOLE CHAN
Associate News Editor

This year’s Sun God Festival — featuring headliners Silversun Pickups, Paul Van 
Dyk, Chiddy Bang and Tommy 
Trash — celebrated its 30th anni-
versary with a sold out audience on 
Friday, May 18.

“Overall, this year’s festival was 
probably the smoothest it’s ever 
been,” Associate Vice President of 
Concerts and Events Oliver Zhang 
said in an email. “Performances 
were smooth, and fairly close to the 
schedule. There weren’t any issues 
like artists missing their set or cut-

THE BEST DAY OF THE YEAR

CHANCELLOR SEARCH

BY ZEV HURWITZ
Associate News Editor

Pradeep Khosla made his first visit 
as chancellor-designate to the UCSD 
campus on Thursday, May 17. Khosla 
was honored at a welcome ceremony 
in the Great Hall in front of a crowd of 
approximately 250 students, adminis-
trators and faculty, including outgoing-
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox.

Khosla was confirmed as UCSD’s 
eighth chancellor by the UC Board of 
Regents at their May 16 meeting in 
Sacramento. He will take over for Fox, 
who has been chancellor since 2004.

Executive Vice Chancellor Suresh 
Subramani, who spoke first at the cer-

emony, said he was eager to work with 
Khosla in the coming years.

“The road ahead promises to be 
exciting,” Subramani said. “We do 
believe that we’re uniquely poised with 
respect to catapulting ourselves into 
our continued trajectory in excellence 
and we look forward to working with 
you under your able leadership.”

Fox announced last July that she 
would step down as Chancellor in the 
summer of 2012 after eight years on 
the job. She only had positive remarks 
about the new chancellor, who will 
officially take office on Aug. 1, 2012.

“You have a natural tendency to 
bring out the best of people,” Fox said. 
“You promote collaboration, innova-
tion and interdisciplinary work and 
studies which are the building blocks 
that have established UC San Diego’s 
tradition of excellence and its reputa-
tion.”

Fox expressed her relief that some-
one would be taking over her job next 

year.
“Chancellor Khosla,” she said. “Boy 

does that sound good.”
Khosla received a series of gifts 

that Subramani calls a “Chancellor’s 
Survival Kit.” He received a pair of 
rose-colored glasses from Subramani, 
an oversized parking pass from 
Chancellor Fox and a UCSD baseball 
cap and a basket of energy bars from 
faculty members.

“I don’t need these glasses,” Khosla 
told the crowd. “Everything here is 
already rose-colored.”

Outgoing A.S. President Alyssa 
Wing presented Khosla with a UCSD 
surfboard to remind him about the 
university’s reputation as ‘best surf 
school,’ in addition to our academic 
achievements.

“I’m sure our surf team will be able 
to give you some pointers,” Wing said 
to a chorus of laughter. “On behalf of 

Kholsa Makes First Official Visit to UCSD
INTERVIEW

The chancellor-designate 
speaks at a welcome event 
after confirmation from 
UC Regents.

The Guardian’s Margaret 
Yau sat down with Chancellor-
Designate Pradeep Khosla for 
an exclusive one-on-one inter-
view on May 17.

Guardian: Can you tell me a 
little bit about your main goals 
for UCSD during your tenure? 

Pradeep Khosla: I think my 
main goal would be, well, sev-
eral goals. Partly to sustain the 
momentum that Marye Anne 
Fox and her chancellorship has 
created. And partly to increase 
that momentum and take us 
into directions that we haven’t 
explored as directly, perhaps. 

G: Do you have any more 
concrete goals, for instance,

ting their set shorter.”
For the third year in a row, 

RIMAC field reached full capacity. 
Student wristbands ran out right 
before the festival opened on Friday 
at 2 p.m. All 3,000 guest tickets 
sold out on Tuesday, May 15. In 
2011, student wristbands ran out on 
Thursday evening before the event 
and guest tickets sold out in three 
days.

Muir College senior Nikki Dinh 
said she picked up her wristband on 

Thursday around 12:30 p.m.
“It took about 45 minutes to get 

my wristband,” Dinh said. “That was 
the peak, I think. The line went all 
the way down to RIMAC.”

New additions to this year’s festi-
val include the expanded dance stage 
to accommodate for the recent pop-
ularity of electronic dance music. 

“I was at the dance stage most of 
the time,” Marshall College senior 
Jessica Zhong said. “The dance stage 
was better than last year, but last 
year’s main stage was better than this 
year. Tommy Trash was my favorite 

DJ at Sun God — his set was awe-
some.”

Zhang said he expects the new 
dance stage set-up to return in a 
similar capacity or be improved 
upon for next year.

“I also think that this year’s fes-
tival was the best it’s ever looked as 
well,” Zhang said. “We made it clear 
from the beginning that we wanted 
to create a true festival environment 
and experience, and I think we’ve 
achieved that and more.” 

Some students thought that the 
security presence increased this year, 
evident by new security measures, 
such as the separation of male and 
female festival attendees at the secu-
rity-staffed entrance to the festival 
grounds. 

“It definitely felt like they were 
stricter on wristbands [this year],” 
Dinh said. “They separated us in the 
beginning, but when we went back 
around 5 p.m., they didn’t separate 
the women and the men.”

Zhang said that he could not 
speak about security changes to this 
year’s festival at the moment, but 
added that the ASCE staff will be 
debrief the event this week and dis-
cuss security issues then. 

“I think that the feedback to the 
festival has been generally positive,” 
Zhang said. “I believe that the com-
bination of the look and feel of the 
festival matched with strong live 
performances really won students 
over. I’m not going to pretend to be 
oblivious to some of the criticism 
we received regarding the lineup, 
but ultimately, the reaction after the 
day of the festival is all that matters 
to me.”

Tighter Security, Stricter Wristband Enforcement at This Year’s Sold-Out Festival

▶ FESTIVAL, from page 1

BRIAN YIP/GUARDIAN



“The Palestinian narrative has been 
misrepresented by the media, and this 
week, we’re trying to correct that,” he 
said. “They normalize the conflict; 
they make it out like it’s okay for it to 
happen, because it’s complicated, when 
it’s not. It’s a humanitarian crisis, sim-
ply put. Gaza Strip is one of the world’s 
largest open-air prisons.”

TFI president Daniel Friedman 
said Israel Solidarity Week was created 
because Jewish students on campus 
were feeling targeted by the claims 
made by SJP and MSA. 

“There’s an international move-
ment against us,” Friedman said. “Just 
as with the American government, 
not everyone agrees with every Israeli 
policy. But using words like ‘racist’ 
or ‘apartheid’ to describe an entire 
nation — what that does is imply that 
the entire state is racist, that the entire 
state is bad.”

Friedman said the rhetoric of the 
pro-Palestinian groups was not accu-

rate, and the TFI displays were con-
structed to convey that. 

“It’s not like everything [on the 
pro-Palestine groups’ boards] is a lie, 
but when terms like ‘ethnic cleansing’ 
and ‘genocide’ are thrown around, it 
misrepresents what’s actually happen-
ing,” he said. “What’s happening is a 
conflict.”

Student activists set up between 
6:30 a.m. and 7:30 a.m. every morning, 
and took down their displays every 
evening between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. 
TFI members handed out pamphlets 
on human rights and answered ques-
tions at “Lunch and Learn” events 
on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. 
Pro-Palestine student activists walked 
up and down Library Walk holding 
signs for their “Silent Protests,” which 
occurred during passing periods on all 
four days of the event. 

The two groups held various speak-
er series’ and solidarity events through-
out the week. On Monday, MSA held 
a speaker series featuring Nasser 
Barghouty titled “What is Apartheid?” 

discussing the nature of inequality in 
the Middle East. SJP held a spoken 
word event on Tuesday, featuring poet-
ry, written and read by UCSD students,   
that advocated Palestinian liberation. 

In response, TFI held a panel on 
Wednesday on the Israel-Palestine 
conflict featuring two UC professors 
and a graduate student. On Thursday, 
TFI arranged for a non-Muslim 
Iranian refugee to the United States 
to speak about the problems in the 
Middle East.

The wall built by MSA and SJP that 
stretched throughout Library Walk 
was twice as large as it was when it 
debuted two years ago. 

“It’s impossible to miss now,” 
Ahmed said. “But even as it stands, it’s 
not enough to convey all the informa-
tion. Maybe one day it’ll cover the 
entire Library Walk. But hopefully not, 
because that would mean the problem 
would still be unsolved.”

the students, we welcome you to our 
campus because here at UC San Diego 
we work hard and we also play hard.”

Khosla, who has served as 
Engineering Dean at Carnegie Mellon 
University since 2004, received a 
standing ovation when he took the 
stage and announced his excitement to 
lead UCSD.

“I have never seen a university 
that in 50 years, has accomplished so 
much,” he said. “I never thought I’d go 
to a public school, but never say never.”  

Though Khosla garnered much 
support during his visit to UCSD, his 
appointment as chancellor has not 
gone without criticism. Khosla and 
the UC Regents have come under fire 

by state legislators including Lt. Gov. 
Gavin Newsom for the compensation 
package that the Chancellor-Designate 
will receive over the next few years. 

Khosla will receive $411,084 
annually — 4.8 percent more than 
Chancellor Fox received — with a 
relocation allowance of over $100,000 
distributed over the next four years. 

At a press conference follow-
ing the ceremony, UC Office of the 
President Media Relations Director 
Steve Montiel defended Khosla’s sal-
ary, saying that the increase in salary 
was necessary to attract qualified can-
didates for the job.

“Chancellors make a difference,” 
Montiel said. “[Salary increases] are 
crucial to the future of UC campuses.”

Montiel noted that Khosla will 

rank 52 out of the 61 members of the 
American Association of Universities 
in salary amount. He also said that 
Khosla’s relocation allowance is typical 
for all UC chancellors.

“Relocation compensation is set 
at one-quarter of one year’s salary,” 
Montiel said. “This will be paid over 
four years.”

Montiel noted that while Khosla’s 
salary is more than Fox’s, it is sig-
nificantly less than the salary he had 
at Carnegie Mellon. He also noted that 
Khosla will forfeit other benefits he 
had at Carnegie Mellon such as free 
tuition for his son Nathan who attends 
Carnegie Mellon as an undergraduate.

any plans for administrative changes 
during your time at UCSD? 

PK: I think it would be too pre-
mature for me to walk in, in two 
hours, and tell you how I think about 
life and the situation. If you look at 
this place, it has achieved a lot in 
the last 50 years. And it has achieved 
that partly because of the entrepre-
neurial nature of the faculty, partly 
because of strong leadership and 
partly because of both. So, going 
forward, it would be important for 
us to define what is a good enabling 
environment that allows a student 
to succeed the way he or she wants 
to, that allows a faculty to achieve 
what they want and for the staff to 
have good careers. But given all the 
difficulties we are facing right now, 
in terms of budgets and whole lot of 
other issues, we have to define what 
is a sustainable-enabling environ-
ment. And if we can define it and 
achieve it, this system would be a 
self-perpetuating system that would, 
over time, would keep feeding into 
itself and its successes. And we 
would become a greater and greater 
university every day.

G: What do you think are UCSD’s 
biggest issues?

PK: I could outline many, but 
I would say budgetary issues. I’m 
not talking about campus budget-
ary issues, I’m talking about the UC 
and the state budget and its impact 
on the quality of education. I think 
that issues related to programs for 
students, what are the right types of 
programs for students, what are the 
right levels of programs for students, 
what is the right investment for this, 
I think would be an issue. 

I think other issues that I alluded 
to in my brief address upstairs where 
the three parts of the campus can 
find their way to be seamlessly inte-
grated, the three parts being Scripps, 
General Campus and the Medical 

School. I think if you take a good 
look at the future, health care and 
human wellness are going to domi-
nate this country and society as a 
whole. And we have such a power-
ful presence in general campus and 
medical school that we need to find 
a way to innovate them. 

G: The UC Regents discussed a 
potential 6 percent increase in tuition 
for the coming 2012-13 school year 
during their last meeting. How are 
you planning on addressing rapidly 
increasing student tuition? 

PK: I wish there was a magic 
bullet I had, a silver bullet where I 
could say, “Forget it, UC San Diego 
is not going to do [tuition increas-
es].” Secondly, I think the way to 
fix this is over time, to raise more 
money for student scholarships, for 
undergraduate scholarships. But 
that is a process that can take one, 
two, three decades, to get to a point 

where everybody can go to school 
for free, it’s nearly impossible. For 
example, the richest university in the 
country with the largest endowment, 
Harvard, still cannot afford to pay 
100 percent tuition for everybody, 
even though technically they can, 
but given their other expenses, they 
cannot afford to do that. 

Students just have to accept the 
fact that there is some level of pay-
ment required of them. The question 
is, what is the right level and what is 
affordable? And this campus, and I 
don’t know if I’m mistaken, I think 
more than 55 percent of students 
on this campus receive some sort 
of financial aid — and significant 
financial aid. And so I’m trying to 
figure out how you, as a writer and 
an editor of this newspaper asking 
this question, are you addressing 
the 45 percent or the 55 percent, 
who receive a significant amount of 

financial aid.
G: In response to that, there have 

been a number of student-based 
coalitions on campus, including the 
Public Education Coalition, who 
have been fighting for the past year 
against rising tuition. I think the 
main issue is the problem of priori-
ties, which actually leads me to my 
next question.   There is a poten-
tial $50 million cut in state funding 
in the coming 2012-13 school year. 
What would you say are your pri-
orities for budget cuts? For example, 
a number of libraries on campus, 
including IR/PS and CLICS were 
shut down this year. 

PK: I can tell you that if we 
shortchange the quality of educa-
tion to our students, that we are 
shortchanging the very purpose as 
to why this university exists. Now, in 
this context, we are trying to look-
ing at what a high-quality education 

means, what are the various com-
ponents that have to be maintained 
and strengthened, and what are the 
components that are fine to have, 
but if they walked away, the impact 
would not be as much on the quality 
of education. I really want to focus 
on the quality of education, the qual-
ity of experience for undergraduate 
and graduate students. 

G: Former Chancellor Marye 
Anne Fox created a number of 
administrative diversity positions in 
response to the Compton Cookout. 
How are you going to address the 
issue of diversity and overall cam-
pus climate?  Do you have plans for 
increasing the enrollment of under-
represented groups? 

PK: I clearly have a goal of 
increasing enrollment, but I have to 
work with my senior staff, the faculty 
and students, because I’m sure there 
are many good ideas floating around 
that I am unaware of. We need to 
create an understanding about the 
right way to achieve this goal. 

G: How do you plan on working 
with the Associated Students in the 
future? 

PK: Last evening, at dinner, I sat 
next to student named Raquel, and I 
told her that I am going to count on 
her to get me connected with the stu-
dents, because there has to be a way 
for me to talk to students directly, 
without anybody being able to filter 
your access to me and my access to 
you. I think we just have to work with 
each other to make sure that there is 
enough access and enough conversa-
tion going on. And it was not just 
the Associated Students. There was 
something else, the SAAC [Student 
Affirmative Action Committee], and 
I was told that they feel they don’t 
have enough voice or representation 
in the chancellor’s office. And to 
me, every student counts exactly the 
same, and I want every student to 
have some form, some voice in the 
chancellor’s office.

4 THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  MONDAY, MAY 21,  2012 |  WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

When choosing what meat you are going to BBQ in this wonderful San Diego 
sunshine, please be informed. Choose 
your meats wisely, and marinate them 
in beer to help prevent cancer.

Two months ago, Harvard 
scientists dropped a bombshell. They 
claimed that one out of five people 
that have a single serving a day of 

processed red meat (bacon, hot dogs, 
sausage, salami) is going to experience 
an early death, probably from heart 
disease or cancer. Leading authors 
in the Harvard study, An Pan, Ph.D. 
and Frank Hu, M.D. Ph.D., based 
their conclusions on a 28-year study 
of 83,644 women and a 22-year study 
of 37,698 men. But don’t worry. If 
you’re having a single daily serving 
of unprocessed red meats like regular 
beef, pork and lamb, you only have 
a 13 percent chance of dying early. 
Awesome.

Where I’m from, we eat, sleep and 
breathe steak. On regular occasion, we 
would get our oak fire going to cook 
Tri-Tip, T-bone or New York Strip, 
with corn, homemade garlic bread 
and slow cooked buttered onion. 
In fact, the most famous restaurant 
in our town — Jocko’s Steak House 
— still grills their steak on oak. The 
rest of their food pretty much sucks, 
especially their salad.  The point is, I 
feel your pain. But the truth is clear: If 
you’re not going to be a vegetarian or 
vegan, then chicken, turkey and fish 
is really where it’s at. BBQ’d vegetables 
also taste amazing, and you know it.

 It’s not just the high saturated 
fats in red meats that cause disease. 
UCSD’s Ajit Varki, M.D., has shown 
that humans have an antibody that 
specifically attacks a sialic acid that is 
present in vertebrate mammal cells 
(cows, pigs, lambs, chimps) but not 
normally present in chicken, turkey, 
fish or humans. In a weird twist of 
evolution, eating foods that contain 
this sialic acid (cow, pig, lamb) causes 
us humans to incorporate it into our 
cells and present it on the surface, 
as if it was our own. Because of this, 
our own antibodies attack it, which 
leads to inflammation. Inflammation 
is linked to many diseases, including 
cancer. Berkeley’s January 2008 
wellness letter, backed by UC 
Berkeley School of Public Health, 
discussed the idea that “low grade 
inflammation may be the cause of all 
chronic diseases.” It’s no secret that 
charring your meat also causes cancer. 
Leading author Robert Gunier at UC 
Berkeley showed that “those who 
reported eating grilled, roasted, or 
broiled meat” had significantly higher 
derivatives of carcinogens in their 
urine. So, slow cook your meat. Don’t 
burn it. Wrap your meat in aluminum 
foil to help prevent fat from dripping 
into the charcoal as this can also cause 
a higher amount of carcinogens. And 
in addition to your spices, include a 
good beer, a tiny bit of lemon juice 
and some olive oil in your marinade. 
These ingredients can substantially 
decrease the amount of carcinogens 
that end up in your grilled meat. Stay 
omnivorous my friends.

In response to 23 car accidents and three deaths caused by people walking 
while texting, the police department in Fort Lee, N.J. has begun ticketing 
people for “careless walking.” Similar safety measures need to be taken by 
police officers around the country because texting can dangerously reduce 
awareness for both pedestrians and drivers.

The police only resorted to this policy after stopping and warning 575 
individuals who were crossing in a dangerous manner, according to John 
Chichowski, a columnist for NewJersey.com. Since the incidents still persisted 
despite the warnings, the police began issuing tickets, resulting in 117 tickets 
handed out since late March. Pedestrians have a responsibility to be safe on 
roads, as seen in jaywalking laws spanning across nearly every U.S. state. This 
policy not only tries to protect pedestrians but also drivers that can only do so 
much to veer away from distracted texters.

While some might argue that this policy micromanages people and doesn’t 
treat them like capable adults, one must keep in mind that there is strong 
evidence that texting is distracting. There have been incidents of people 
walking into walls, falling into fountains and even almost walking into a bear 
— all of the incidents were caused by texting while walking, from an ABC 
report titled “Texting Dangers.” This, coupled with the accidents, deaths and 
the research that states that pedestrians are 60 percent more likely to swerve 
into someone while texting — reported by Mobiledia — reinforces the fact 
that this is something that would benefit the safety of citizens in the long-run.

This policy has only been implemented after accidents, deaths and 
warnings by the police. It is a policy aimed for the protection of both 
pedestrians and drivers.

Ban Ensures the Safety of  Both Pedestrians and Drivers Lawmakers Should Focus on More Pressing Safety Concerns
The police of Fort Lee, N.J., have recently begun issuing $85 fines to 

citizens caught texting while crossing the street. While lawmakers have 
the right intentions, this new ban unnecessarily micromanages citizens 
and discounts the notion of personal responsibility. It is more important 
for lawmakers to invest in other safety efforts, such as a more aggressive 
campaign to punish distracted drivers.

Laws requiring drivers to put down their cell phones while driving are 
reasonable, but to expect the same thing of pedestrians is going too far. 
When a driver in the United States gets behind the wheel, he accepts huge 
legal responsibilities such as having normal or corrected-to-normal vision, 
functioning brake lights and placing children in appropriate safety seats. 
Drivers can be expected to obey these laws because they are tested and 
licensed before driving, while pedestrians have no such contract.

Furthermore, distracted texting only endangers the life of the person 
texting, while distracted driving poses a threat on a much wider scale. Laws 
are costly to enforce, and having to police such a petty ban is an inefficient 
use of officials’ time. It would be more beneficial for lawmakers to prioritize 
their efforts on more threatening public safety concerns. The National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration reported that there were 4,280 
pedestrian fatalities in 2010, with the majority due to urban arterial roads 
that are not accommodating to pedestrians. According to David Goldberg, 
spokesman for the Transportation for America campaign, the creation of 
more safe crosswalks would be essential to preventing pedestrian deaths. 

The bottom line is that it is over the top to impose this ban — the dangers 
of distracted walking should be left to the discretion of individuals.

QUICK TAKES SINCE MARCH 2012, A NEW JERSEY TOWN BEGAN HANDING OUT $85 TICKETS TO PEDESTRIANS WHO TEXT WHILE CROSSING THE STREET IN RESPONSE TO THREE DEATHS THAT OCCURRED WHILE WALKING AND TEXTING.

As graduation season rolls around, several state governments — Idaho, 
Indiana, Minnesota and South Dakota 
most recent among them — are rolling 
out scholarships for students who 
graduate in three years or less. The 
University of California system should 
promote a similar monetary incentive 
to graduating early — it proves most 
beneficial to the student, the college 
and the whole state economy alike. 

A 2002 study conducted by 
Kathleen Porter for the ERIC 
Clearinghouse on Higher Education 
found that students who graduate 
earlier are more likely to earn more 
money over the course of their careers. 
This finding makes sense: students 
who push themselves to finish early 
have more time and energy to focus 
toward landing a good job and moving 
upwards professionally.

Graduating early benefits students 

by compelling them to take greater 
advantage of college resources — 
namely, summer sessions. UCSD’s 
summer break is 15 weeks long — 
enough time, thanks to the way our 
academic schedule is set up, to take 
over a quarter’s worth of classes. The 
nature of the course offerings as split 
between two sessions makes it possible 
for students to get ahead. Furthermore, 
students receiving financial aid 
during the school year are always 
eligible for aid over the summer. But 
as it currently stands, less than half 
of UCSD students take classes over 
the summer session. Incentivizing 
graduating early would encourage 
more students to use their time 
effectively and get the most out of their 
undergraduate education. 

Students should also graduate 
early, especially if they are part of the 
growing trend of pursuing education 
beyond undergrad studies. Graduate 

school, to name one example, has 
become vastly more popular than 
before.  A 2010 study conducted by 
Duke University found that student 
admissions to graduate school have 
shot up by an incredible 31 percent in 
the past decade alone. And at schools 
like UCSD, which have reputations 
for being even more pre-professional 
than average, the old notion of 
one’s undergraduate years being the 
last schooling before entering the 
workforce is even less close to reality.

Not only that, but in this economy, 
it takes longer to get to graduate 
school. The average entering age for 
the UCSD School of Medicine is now 
25. That is up by a full three years 
from 22, the average age for entering 
students in 1970, the earliest year for 
which data is available. More students 
need graduates school to get a job, and 

The UC system should follow the example of  other schools across the country and provide monetary 
incentives to students who graduate early, which would benefit both students and the state economy.

students need work experience to 
get into graduate school. Students 
interested in professional school 
should graduate early because, 
depending on the work experience 
a particular grad school requires, 
it may be the only way for them to 
land a job before they are 30.

Students who graduate early also 
benefit the UC system, because it 
loses roughly $1,000 per quarter on 
each undergraduate enrolled at one 
of its campuses. This is because the 
cost of educating a UC student still 
exceeds the tuition they pay.  And 
43 percent of UC students take 
longer than four years to graduate, 
according to the 2011 College 
Portrait, released last December 

by the Office of Student Research 
and Information at UCSD. This 43 
percent exacerbates the problem 
by costing the UC thousands of 
dollars in extra quarters for their 
education. The benefit — an 
employed, tax-paying California 
citizen — is the same no matter 
when a UC student graduates. 
Conversely, students who graduate 
early are financial assets to the UC 
because the university system gets 
the same benefit at a lower cost. 

Students who graduate early get 
to pay less as well. UC tuition has 
been increasing at a rate of over 30 
percent every five years, according 
to statistics released by the UC 
Office of the President, and shows 
no sign of slowing down. Interest 

rates for California students were 
higher in 2011 than they were in 
over a decade, and the average debt 
at graduation was at an all-time 
high of $18,113. In this economy, 
saving thousands of dollars on 
tuition by graduating early is a 
definite plus for any student. 

In this economy, graduating 
early can offer significant benefits 
for students seeking to enter the 
workforce, as well as those seeking 
to apply to graduate school. 
Furthermore, at a public school 
like UCSD, it offers unquestionable 
benefits to the university as well.

Dear Editor,
�ere are strict regulations on 

what can be considered “organic.” 
However, there are very few on the 
word “natural.” 

�ere is high fructose corn 
syrup (or “corn sugar,” as the new 
marketing term goes) in many 
products that claim to be “all 
natural.”

What’s so bad about high 
fructose corn syrup? �ere is a 
lot of labeling that has started to 
advertise that it does not contain 
this chemical, but why? 

Well, it only shuts down our 
body’s ability to say when we are 
full.

You ever wonder why “Big 
Gulps” and “Super-Size Me” are 
modern inventions when we have 
had soda for decades? 

It is not because people have 
just recently acquired a taste for the 
sugary beverage. 

In fact, it is because no one 
could stomach that much soda 
decades ago. 

Literally, when you ate too much 
sugar your body would reject the 
contents of your stomach. 

Not any more, thanks to high 

fructose corn syrup, you won’t lose 
your giant lunch. Still not seeing a 
problem? 

You never get full and never feel 
satis�ed. One liter of soda later and 
you are still craving sugar. 

Princeton University has even 
started linking high fructose 
corn syrup to abnormal weight 
gain when compared to other 
sweeteners. 

And we wonder why America 
keeps having to loosen its belt with 
all our diet fads and the French, 
eating eclairs, stay skinny. 

It is time we start pondering the 
unfamiliar ingredients on the labels 
of our food. We may then discover 
the unfortunate truth: our food is 
toxic.

“You can go on as many soul-searching trips as you want, but you still 
won’t find the answers,” Shivani 
Singh said.

For Singh, Muir ’00, it took a 
lot more than just a trip to find her 
higher calling. 

At the young age of 29, Singh has 
made it her life’s goal to spread the 
knowledge she has gained through-

out her years of wandering.
Her book “Discover Your 

Dharma,” the winner of the Best 
New Age Book Award in 2010 from 
the Next Generation Indie Book 
Award, and her company Dharma 
Express both work to give lost souls 
like Singh a step in the right direc-
tion.

It was only after Singh’s own long 
struggle finding purpose that she 

began to help others find theirs.
Despite finding a stable job after 

graduation, Singh, a bright phys-
ics major, was not satisfied with 
the path her life had taken. Her 
problem was a common one among 
recent college graduates: She did not 
feel that her day job was fulfilling 
enough to construct an entire life 
around.

For over a decade, J.K. Rowling’s fantastic world of magic and adventure has 
amazed people of all ages. Geisel 
Library has brought that world into 
reality by hosting Harry Potter’s 
World: Renaissance Science, Magic, 
and Medicine — a traveling exhibit 
put on by the U.S. National Library 
of Medicine.

The exhibit highlights how many 
of the marvels and ideas seen within 
Harry Potter’s stories, such as alche-
my and astrology, have real world 
roots as traditional Renaissance 
traditions. 

The exhibit, running from May 
6 to June 16, consists of a number of 

displays and events, including guest 
lectures by Professors Henry Powell 
of the UCSD School of Medicine, 
Robert Graham of the Jacobs School 
of Engineering, Literature Professor 
Stephen Potts and the Dean of 
UCSD Arts and Humanities Seth 
Lerer.

Professor Lerer, a former teacher 
at Stanford and Princeton and author 
of Children’s Literature: A Reader’s 
History from Aesop to Harry Potter, 
is interested in how the Harry Potter 
universe has also portrayed books 
and literature from the past.

“What interests me about Harry 
Potter is why so many of the scenes 
in the books and movies take place 

in the library, and in my talk I sug-
gested that wizardry is a heightened 
form of literacy; meaning that to be 
a great wizard is to be a great reader 
of a textbook,” Lerer said.

Many of the classes in the books, 
like potions, are similar to chemistry 
classes from both the Renaissance 
and present times. In a school where 
many aspire to be doctors, Harry 
Potter’s World then offers students a 
new perspective on Harry Potter and 
their own studies.

“In this exhibit it shows us that 
a lot about medicine and alchemy 
and reading is about healing, and 
it’s about the place of early medicine 
and the human body in all this,” 

Lerer said. “There is a lot about 
Harry Potter that takes us back to a 
world where doctors and physicians 
were as much magicians as they were 
scientists or surgeons.”

Lerer believes that this exhibit is 
important not just for the compari-
sons it brings, but also the valuable 
lessons it can teach to UCSD stu-
dents, especially new students.

“I think one of the things that’s 
very difficult for a lot of people is 
that they feel lost in big, impersonal 
places,” he said. “If you grew up in a 
small town, or went to a small high 
school, and you come to a place like 
UCSD; it’s large and bureaucratic. 
There are these strange traditions; 

there are these hierarchies of power. 
Harry Potter and this exhibit can 
teach you how to negotiate your way 
around a big, bureaucratic, imper-
sonal institution. Where a chancel-
lor can show up as magically as a 
Minister of Magic.”

Growing up, she aspired to 
become a female astronaut and travel 
to the moon. To no one’s surprise, the 
ambitious and talented student was 
able to a score a job with NASA after 
graduation.

After working with NASA as a 
researcher for three years, she admit-
ted to losing her passion for her 
childhood dream job. 

“After a while, it was as if I was 
going day-in, day-out, like a phonetic 
machine,” Singh said.

Hoping that furthering her educa-
tion would rekindle the spark, she 
left her job and attended graduate 
school, majoring in material sci-
ence and engineering and work-
ing with the Scripps Institute of 
Oceanography on environmental 
pollutants. But there was still some-
thing missing. 

“Everyone would always tell me 
how brilliant and smart I was, but I 
didn’t know exactly what to do with 
that,” Singh said. “And I saw everyone 
around me, all of my classmates from 
high school and grad school, and I 
thought, ‘All of these people are so 
awesome, but they’re not doing any-
thing about it.’” 

She decided to leave her graduate 
program to travel the world. During 
a trip to India, she was introduced to 
the concept of Dharma, the driving 
force behind Dharma Express.

Dharma is a Sanskrit word and a 
philosophy that refers to the concept 
of a higher duty, or purpose in life. 
Singh realized that in her own strug-

gle to find fulfillment, it was dharma 
that she was seeking.

Upon her return, Singh took to 
her library for more inspiration. She 
pulled books from many of her per-
sonal heroes such as Mother Teresa, 
Ghandi, Leonardo DaVinci and 
Pablo Picasso, looking to find how 
they went about finding their unique 
contribution to the world. She found 
one common denominator: journal-
ing. All of these famous figures were 
avid writers and by getting their 
thoughts out on paper, they were able 
to organize their character in a way 
that helped them to realize the path-
way they wanted to take.

Singh’s next step was to work with 
neuroscientists at UC San Diego. She 
joined the journaling technique with 
the research done by UCSD neu-
roscientists on the effects of music 
and thinking. This combination, she 
found, streamlined the process of 
discovering one’s identity and inner 
thoughts. 

She then began to work on start-
ing up Dharma Express.

 “So I tried to make this pro-
gram that would help all of those 
people change the world,” Singh said. 
“Young people, like you and I, could 
make a difference if they only knew 
how.”  

Working with the Start-Up 
Leadership Program, a company 
designed to link young entrepreneurs 
to the resources they need to begin 
their innovative companies, she was 
able to begin the founding research 
for her book, and the company that 

would spread the ideas in it.  She 
became a teaching assistant for Sixth 
College’s writing program, Culture, 
Art and Technology, where she 
would use the students in her discus-
sion section to test out the journaling 
and music system she created. This, 
along with the donated work of many 
of her peers, allowed her to develop 
the specific regimen that Dharma 
Express promotes to followers today.

“Discover Your Dharma,” the 
book she wrote based on all of her 
research, outlines the way that her 
program can help the gifted scholars 
and minds around her to do exactly 
what the title suggests. “Discover 
Your Dharma” has inspired people 
to clear their minds of clutter and 
enable them to find their ultimate 
goals in life. 

After writing the book, her com-
pany began developing other plat-
forms and forms of technology, such 
as web applications and blogs, which 
would spread her coaching sessions 
to reach larger audiences. Singh still 
travels, but instead of going to look 
for answers she is now looking to 
spread them. She tours universities, 
hoping to guide college students 
that she knows are facing the all too 
common dilemma of asking, “What 
next?” Because, although it is pretty 
common knowledge that university 
graduates have serious brains, some-
times the secret lies in figuring out 
exactly what to do with them.

SHAHLA TALEBI: GHOSTS OF REVOLUTION - 
LITERATURE BLDG RM 155
A native of Iran, Shahla Talebi lived through a

imprisonment under two different regimes of the Shah 
and the Islamic Republic of Iran, and a period shaped 
by eight bloody years of War with Iraq between 1980 
to 1988. Since August 2007 she has been a faculty of 
religious studies in Arizona State University. Talebi's 
first book, Ghosts of Revolution: Rekindled memories 
of imprisonment, was published in 2011 by Stanford 
University Press. She is interested in understanding 
violence, memory, mourning, and trauma, and in 
tracing the topographies and impasses of the Iranian 
Revolution of 1979 and its aftermath. She is 
particularly interested in the way people re-create new 
forms of life and community in the midst and in the 
aftermath of violence.

Looking for a great pharmacy school?

further than 

the University of
Michigan.

as University of Michigan PharmD students. 1. Financial support unequalled by any

other U.S. pharmacy school.

times.

Baseball Eliminated From West Regional Tournament
Michaels on a passed ball to bring 
the score to 6–2. UCSD picked up 
another run in the bottom of the 
ninth, but it wasn’t enough to close 
the gap.

GAME 2

UCSD recorded five runs in 
the second inning, as the bottom 
of the Triton batting order loaded 
the bases, bringing junior Danny 
Susdorf up to bat. 

The All-West Region selection 
singled to left field for two RBI and 
advanced to second on a throwing 
error. 

Batting in the two-hole, junior 
Richard Siegel was walked, while 
sophomore Garrett Tuck singled 

through the left side to bat in two 
more runs. Western Oregon’s Kirk 
Lind gave up his fourth walk in two 
innings to put the Tritons up 5–0.

Susdorf picked up his third RBI 
in the third inning to put the Tritons 
up 6–0. 

UCSD used another five run 
inning in the sixth to secure the 
win. With two outs Michaels batted 
in Ringold to score. Susdorf batted 
in another run, before Siegel struck 
a double for one RBI. Tuck capped 
the inning by singling to right 
center for two RBI.

Right-hander Goodbrand went 
the distance, recording his 11th 
straight win. 

GAME 3

Neither team got on the board 
until the fifth inning, when Dixie 
State’s Joe Andrade homered down 
the rightfield line for two RBI.

The Red Storm put UCSD 3–0 in 
the hole in the sixth, as the Tritons 
rotated through three pitchers in 
the inning — Selarz, junior Richard 
Kilbury and Tuma.

Dixie State hit up Tuma for 
three runs in the seventh, with two 
doubles.

UCSD recovered four runs in the 
eighth, as Susdorf singled with bases 
loaded, for two RBI. 

Siegel followed up with a hit to 
score one more, while Susdorf was 
brought in on a Tuck ground out.

could, always thinking about where 
I wanted to be. 

I wanted to stand on that 
national podium as champion, and 
I wanted Western Field Athlete of 
the Year from the NCAA, and more 
than anything, I wanted and want to 
go to London for the 2012 Olympic 
games.

My hard work paid off, but 
limited me as I trained like a 
bodybuilder rather than a javelin 
thrower, making my muscles and 
upper body too tight to throw as well 
as I wanted to in the regular season. 
I threw an automatic qualifier, and 
came into Nationals ranked sixth.  
       I came into that meet in North 
Carolina with a simple attitude, 
‘I will win. I have decided.’ 
       I did not start out strong and 
barely made finals, but popped off 
a big throw in the fifth round to 
take the competition and become 
national champion. 

And then I was home, and it 
was over. That’s how fast it was. 
  Junior year, I won the competition 
on my first throw. I have made 
Nationals my house.

This year, I won the CCAA for 
the fourth consecutive time and got 
the award Thu got four years ago 
— Western NCAA Field Athlete of 
the Year.

Now, I am looking for my 
third NCAA Championship 
title, and it will come.  
       As for my final goal this year — 
London 2012 — it will come.

No. 24 Softball Falls in Title Game to No. 1 Valdosta
head coach Patti Gerckens said to 
the UCSD Athletics program. “We 
lost to the No. 1 team in the country, 
they were good and they deserved 
to win this game.”  

With a lackluster finish to the 
regular season — finishing fourth in 
the conference with a 23-13 record, 
unranked nationally — the Tritons 
seemed a long shot to qualify for the 
national tournament. 

Plagued with injuries, UCSD 
outclassed its CCAA opponents 
to claim the automatic bid to the 
West Regionals. The sixth-seeded 
Tritons fought their way through 
eight games, going 6-2 to enter the 
College World Series as the lowest 
ranked team. 

“Our regular season was 
mediocre, but our postseason was 
tremendous,” Gerckens said. “We 
extended it by three weeks, had 

more games than ever before and 
overall it was a great season. Only 
one team can end with a win and 
unfortunately this year it wasn’t us.”

Senior centerfielder Kris 
Lesovsky and Gaito — UCSD’s 
two All-Americans — both earned 
All-Tournament team honors. 
       Lesovsky — a fifth year transfer 
from Florida Tech — leaves UCSD 
with a handful of career records. 
The centerfielder has the record for 
all-time leader in batting average, 
hits, RBI, runs, doubles and walks.

Gaito graduates from UCSD 
as the all-time leader in wins 
(98), saves, appearances, innings, 
strikeouts and complete games. The 
right-hander (98-31) recorded a 
1.10 ERA over the span of her last 
four seasons with the Tritons.

Out in the
End

Making 
this NCAA 
House My 
Home
I have been to the NCAA Track & Field Championships three times and I’ll be leaving this 
Tuesday for my fourth. My freshman 
year, I barely made the grade, getting 
in by the skin of my teeth and 

finishing not much better, but as 
for the past two years, I have made 
Nationals my home. 

During my freshman year, Nick 
Morilla, the UCSD throws captain at 
the time and a boulder of a man, was a 
big part of why I made it to Nationals 
in the first place. He was there as 
I was stepping onto the runway 
at the CSULA Last Chance meet.  
       I knew that throw was going 
to decide whether I was going 
to nationals with athletes that 
are now reached Olympic levels, 
or if I was going to miss out. 
       I’ll never forget Nick saying, 
“Come on Pookie, go home, go 
home!” 

Yes he called me Pookie, but that 
call to go home is what really fired 
me up and gave me the focus to post 
a new school record on that throw 
despite only being a freshman. 

When Nick said “home,” he 
meant Texas, because Nationals 
that year were being held at Abilene 
Christian, just a few hours from my 
old high school in Little Elm, Texas. 
Just a few hours away from where I 
grew up.

Getting on that plane was 
honestly like hopping into the 
back of your big sibling’s car with 
all their friends. You do not feel 
like you belong, yet you want to 
fit in so badly. That was me, the 
little sibling amongst giants. There 
were NCAA National Champions, 
Christine Merrill and Leah Blue, 
and many other All-Americans. I 
had only been doing this javelin 
thing for a few months but there 
I was, way out of my league. 
       The first night we were there, 
and every first night, the NCAA 
hosted a banquet for all the 
athletes and coaches. Aside from 
the sometimes questionable food, 
like a one-table, Italian-style buffet 
for 500 people, they handed out 
Regional Athlete of the Year awards 
at this banquet. That year, Danielle 
Thu, now an assistant coach for 
the team, received “Field Athlete 
of the Year” for the West Region.  
       As I watched her walk onto that 
stage, I knew that that was where I 
wanted to be.

The rest of the meet was a blur, 
with Danielle winning the hammer 
throw and Linda Rainwater winning 
the heptathlon. I threw, but not well 
enough to make finals, and then we

The No. 24 UCSD Softball team’s bid for a second straight national title came 
to a close with a loss to No. 1 
Valdosta State in the title game of 
the NCAA Division II National 
Championship last Saturday, May 19. 
    The Tritons opened the tournament 
with a win over No. 1 nationally 
ranked Valdosta State. UCSD would 
meet with the Blazers again in the 
final match, after falling out of the 

winner’s bracket with a 12-inning 
1-0 loss to No. 3 Kutztown. 

The Tritons then battled their 
way back from the brink, beating 
Midwest champions St. Joseph’s 2-1 
and then No. 2 Central Oklahoma 
2-0 to advance to the title match 
against Valdosta. 

UCSD All-American senior 
Camille Gaito (33-12) took the 
mound for the Tritons. Pitching her 
17th full game, Gaito gave up a 
home run to Valdosta’s Courtney 
Albritton in her first at-bat. The 
game remained scoreless until the 

fourth inning. With bases loaded, 
sophomore right fielder Caitlin 
Brown dropped a pop fly to put the 
Blazers up 2-0. 

Gaito retired her next two batters, 
to sneak the Tritons out of the inning. 
UCSD took one run back in their 
next turn at-bat, as sophomore left 
fielder Kirsten Willmon scored on 
an illegal pitch. 

In the bottom of the sixth, 
Valdosta put the game out of reach, 
as the Blazers put runners on first 
and second. 

The runners were moved over 

on a sacrifice bunt. With just one 
out, Gaito gave up her eighth hit of 
the game, bringing both runners in 
to score.

In just their second-ever 
appearance at the College World 
Series, the Tritons’ championship 
run counts as one of the most 
remarkable midseason turnarounds 
in program history. 

“There were times [this season] 
where I wouldn’t imagine we’d be 
here. [Our players] were fighters, 
and I’m so proud of them,” UCSD

Tritons Drop Out of  West Regionals

BASEBALL — After notching 
their fourth consecutive CCAA 
conference tournament title last 
week, the UCSD Baseball team’s 
season came to an end with two 
losses to Dixie State in the first round 
of the West Regional tournament.

The third-seeded Tritons 
opened NCAA tournament play last 
Thursday, May 17, dropping 7–3 
to second-seed Dixie State. UCSD 
battled to stave off elimination in 
its second match against first-seed 
Western Oregon the following day 
with an 11–1 win, before conceding 
its second tournament loss to Dixie 
State 6–4. 

The Tritons will end the season 
with a 33–24 overall record, a 
regular season conference and 
CCAA tournament title. 

Despite losing for the second 
straight time in the West Regional 
round, the Tritons will come into 
2013 with only one Triton — Gregg 
Ringold — missing from their 
batting order. 

The UCSD bullpen, on the other 
hand, will graduate five of their best 
arms — Justin Burns, Jeff Rauh, 
Greg Selarz, Elias Tuma and Tony 

York. The Tritons will retain junior 
right-hander Ryan Goodbrand (11–
0). The junior, who didn’t see much 
time last year behind Triton ace 
Tim Shibuya, has grown to become 
UCSD’s most reliable starter. 
Goodbrand went the distance in 
the Tritons’ 1–1 win over Western 
Oregon, allowing just five hits in his 
nine innings.

GAME 1

UCSD had a tough time in the 
box. The Tritons only managed to 
record three hits in their first five 
innings, as the Red Storm took a 6–0 
lead off a grand slam in the bottom 
of the fifth inning. 

UCSD right-hander Trevor Scott 
was relieved in favor of Justin Burns 
in the sixth, as the Tritons mounted 
their comeback. The Tritons took 
one back, with sophomore Nick 
La Face — named the CCAA 
tournament’s most outstanding 
player — picking up his fifth home 
run of the season. 

Dixie State’s Michael Dedrick 
tallied his only two walks of the game 
to load the bases in the seventh. 
The Tritons scored sophomore Sam
