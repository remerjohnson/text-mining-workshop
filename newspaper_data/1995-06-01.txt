UCR Gets $510,000 
For Microscopes 
RIVERSIDE - The National 
Science Foundation (NSF) 
recently awarded UCR 
$550,000 to establish a state-
of-the-art Electron Microscopy 
and Visualization Facility. The 
original proposal requested 
$1.25 million from NSF, 
which UCR would match. 
Though NSF did not deliver 
the full amount requested, 
UCR still contributed $1.1 
million. The facility will house 
two new and two old electron 
microscopes, as well as the 
existing Center for Visual 
Computing. Expected to 
become fully operational in 
early 1996, it will be available 
to faculty, staff, properly 
qualified students and post-
doctoral researchers.

AS. Comes to Budget 
Compromise After Veto 
DEBATE: Council leaves 
much of UCSA funding 
intact, cuts CWD money 
By Nina Boughton 
Staff Writer 

Following three hours of heated debate, 
the A.S. Council approved its 1995-96 activ-
ity-fee budget last night, raising University 
of California Student Association (UCSA) 
funding and reducing funding for the Com-
mittee for World Democracy (CWO). 

A.S. President Naomi Falk vetoed the 
activity budget Tuesday after the council 

voted Friday to reduce UCSA funding to one 
dollar per student per year. 

"Any decision I would make as to culling 
one proposal over another would make some-
one unt'lappy," said Falk. "I thought by veto-
ing the budget in its entirety, I'd give the 
council the ability to evaluate the whole 
budget_" 

Falk added that she felt the UCSA was an 
important organization which deserved to be 
fully funded at $1.50 per student per year. 

"UCSA has been in existence 25 years," 
said Falk. "It has proven itself in lobbying 
and now in policy. J don't see why we

UCSA Collects 
450 Letters to 
Gov. Wilson in 
Access Campaign 
STATE: Students urged to protest 
fee hikes and financial aid cuts by 
writing to California legislators 
By Heather McRea 
Staff Writer 

Over 450 letters to Gov. Wilson and state legisla-
tors have been collected from students at UCSD since 
last Friday as part of a UC-wide "Access Campaign" 
sponsored by the UC Student Association (UCSA). 

The Access Campaign, which seeks to promote 
greater accessability to the university, kicked off its 
letter-writing campaign with a rally last week at the 
Price Center. Students were asked to handwrite letters 
to Gov. Pete Wilson protesting rising student fees, the 
elimination of affirmative-action programs and con-
gressional proposals to reduce student finaneia1 aid. 

The letter-writing component of the Access Cam-
paign, which ends today, is likely to meet its goal of 
500 letters, according to UCSA Director of Field 
Organizing Kimi Lee. 

"Wilson's the main target," she said. "[The let-
ters] show that students are aware of the issues." 

Lee said the letter-writing campaign is specificaJly 
targeting the state budget, which is scheduled for a 
vote this month. She added that s~e hopes the letters 
will be read while legislators are deciding on the 
budget. 

UCSA Campus Office Director Brian Dowd said 
that it was important for Wilson to see UC students as 
a large voting block which cares about the effects of 
the budget on higher education. 

"This is a perfect time, because the revised budget 
should be going out in the next few weeks, and we 
want to send the message to the state government that 
students care about these issues and are prepared to 
vote that way," 'Oowd said. 

A.S. President Naomi Falk said she was pleased 
with the turnout of students. 

"It's been really successful so far," said Falk. "This 
has been the most successful letter-writing campaigQ 
we've had." 

Both Falk and Lee said they were optimistic about 
the effect the letters will have on the legislators. Falk 
said the Senate had already shown its support for 
students but that the As .. embly has not given the same 
level of support to them. 

"I think it'll have a very large effect on the legisla-
ture," said Falk. "They kind of need that extra little

RDAC Petitions for 
Better Mail Service 
POSTAL: Students complain that delays and 
inconsistencies plague the campus mail system 
By Terry Lew 
Staff Writer 

Led by Warren College senior 
Carol Jaramillo, members of the 
Warren Resident Dean's Advisory 
Council (RDAC) are spearheading 
a petition to improve the quality of 
mail services on campus. 

According to 
Jaramillo, the main 
complaint at 
RDAC's winter 
quarter "town meet-

Deans and resident 
deans from every

said Mike Cannone, spokesman for 
the San Diego Postal District, "we'll 
do our best to fix it, but we don't 
look at anything but the ZIP code. 
The university itself has the task of 
delivering it to the addressees." 

"They've got a lot of automation 
there, but in the manual part, there is 

a lot of chance for 
human error," said 
Jeanette Janousck,a 
UCSD student and 
UCSD Mail Ser-

"If I had to generalize the prob-

that mail was always late or would 
be lost or returned to the sender." 

The delays ue currently unex-
plainable, according to UCSD Mail 
Services Manager Pat Procopio. 
Procopio said he believes the prob-
lem lies with the United States Postal 
Service (USPS). 

"In November, 1994 we switched 
our mail forwarding system to the 
USPS," he said. 

"We were told [forwarding] 
would only take a couple of week.s. 
Some took two to three months." 

"One letter I know oftook four to 
five months to be delivered," he 
added. "That's clearly a breakdown 
in the system."

Even if mail arrived on time, 

students often complained that it 
did not belong to them. 

"Mail is put in my box even 
though there is no reason why any-
one would think it is for me," said 
one student. 

Students also complained that 
mail was being misdirected or lost. 
"Bills went back to the sender," said 
another student, "saying I had moved 
when I had not." 

Despite ongoing problems, 
Procopio Slid he believes the qual-
ity of Mail Services has improved.

The majority of the council, how-
ever, disagreed with Falk. Marshall 
Senior Senator Richard Freye said, 
"We were kind of all united with 
one dollar, and we should stay with 
it. " 

"Basically what this boils down 
to is, how can we spend money best 
forthestudents?" said Warren Sena-
tor Ian Middleton. "I believe the 
difference between one dollar and 
$1.50 is best spent on student orga-

Since the council was split over 
the UCSA funding issue, many 
members called for a compromise. 
In the end, the council raised fund-
ing for UCSA to S1.25 per student 
per quarter. 

The council also debated cutting 
funding for the CWD's Friday Film 
Series by S5,OOO. Vice President 
Finance Edmondo Robinson ob-
jected to the amount which CWD 
might receive. He pointed to the 
fact that CWD was a separate part of 
the executive budget, unlike all other 
student organizations. 

"S21,OOO is a lot of money. Next 
week we'll have 10 appeals from 
groups who couldn't get $500 for an 
event," said Robinson.

UCSA Funding Cut Is 
Detrimental to Students 

With the limited resources available to students to fight 
issues such as fee hikes, this year's UC Student Association 
(VCSA) has accomplished stellar achievements, and for the 
ASUCSD to reduce funding for the organization is a travesty 
of a magnitude the current student government clearly fails to 
understand. 

In the past, the ASUCSD spent $1.50 per student each 
quarter to fund the only official voice to counter the UC 
Regents - the UCSA. Without such input, students would be 
helpless to the whims of ,he regents who, more often than not, 
pursue business-minded policies for the Uc. The regents have 
failed to understand and uphold California's commitment to 
higher education. 

Although the UC's short-term expenditures maintain 
current standards, its long-term "gains" are potentially disas-
trous. With the education of the state's residents comes a 
bolstered economy, which would be a worthy investment for 
all Californians, including the UC regents. 

However, if the state denies higher education to the popu-
lace, it merely continues to subject all but the wealthy to a 
status which perpetuates a sentiment of frustration and anger 
- a veritable denial of opportunity. Oearly, it is in the favor

B~t by ~oosjn8 to~rtailjunding to the UCSA under the 
preteJSC otrcoucing a bloated budget, the A.S. Council onJy 
serves to alienate those who are not within a privileged system 
of higher education. The ASUCSD has no need to cut its 
funding to ~ UCSA, since it does not count on the perenni-
ally diminutive budget of the state to the Uc. The ASUCSD is 
dependent only on a budget which it collects annually at a 
stable level from UCSD students. In light of higher 
education 's continued elitism, the ASUCSD, as a representa-
tive of UCSD's student body, cannot afford to decrease 
funding to one of the few organizations which chooses to stand 
for students and their legal rights to higher education. 

UCSD Takes Positive Step 
With Cross-Cultural Center 

With the passage of Proposition 187 and current threats to 
eliminate affirmative action, we have witnessed a particularly 
hostile year for people of color in the political and educational 
arenas. Fortunately, UCSD has made a positive step toward 
supporting underrepresented groups on campus with the 
establishment of the Cross-Cultural Center, which opened last 
Friday. 

A.S. Presidel'lt Naomi Falk called the center "a much 
needed link between the diverse constituency at UCSD." Much 
needed indeed, considering that in 1994, Chicanos represented 
only 9.4 percent of the student population, Filipinos 4.8 
percent, African Americans 2.5 percent, Latinos 2.4 percent 
and Native Americans 0.9 percent. 

Although programs such as Student Outreach and Recruit-
ment and the OASIS Summer Bridge Program have helped to 
increase the number of first-year minority students, the number 
of students who drop out after their first year is alarmingly 
high. 

The center will improve retainment with such services as a 
faculty/staff/student mentor program, ethnic-studies seminars 
and motivational speakers. 

Though these on-campus programs will be beneficial to 
UCSD students, the center should also heed the advice of 
Student Affirmative Action Committee Chair Buu Aaron, who 
said that "unless there is some pro-action and some 
politicization of the campus - which should come from [the 
eross-QIltural Center) - then we do a disservice to the ... 
people who had to struggle so this place can exist." The center 
cannot effectively change the status of underrepresented 
groups unless it becomes active on the systemwide, state and 
nationallevcl. We cannot expect to create an inclusive micro-
cosm at UCSD when society sets the example that excluding 
people of color is acceptable.

ANOTHER TAKE ON 
THE TRADE WAR 

COMMENTARY: Instead of imposing trade sanctions, the United 
States should tax Japan for its bad taste and bad habits 

With the imposition of a 
lOO-percent tariff on imported 
Japanese luxury cars, the office 
of the U.S. Trade Representa-
tive (USTR) has attempted to 
rectify, by coercion instead of 
diplomacy, the lingering trade 
imbalance with Japan. This will 

.chirpy melodies and frothy lyrics, not to mention bla-
tanlly stealing songs from American bands, to which 
they write their own lyrics. Given this blasphemy 
against a cherished aspect of Americana, I feel pun-
ishment is due. We could forbid American rock musi-
cians from performing in Japan, which would be ef-
fective since a Michael Ja.ckson boycott, for example, 
would probably lead Japan's youth to stage a nation-

lead Tokyo to 
file a grievance 
with the World 
Trade Organiza-
tion (WTO) and 
will possibly re-
sult in retalia-
tory tariffs. 

The USTR is 
fighting this battle the wrong way. By 
targeting the controversial a!ltomotive 
industry, the USTR will bring about the 
condemnation of the WTO and other 
U.S. trading partners, not to mention a 
souring of U.S.-Japan relations. The 
U.S. could take other measures which 
would make an equally strong state-
ment, but still retain the approbation of 
our trading partners. 

Japan has taken many American in-
ventions in marvelous directions. For 
example, the Japanese took American 
assembly-line manufacturing tech- , 
niques and, observing the "pull system" 
used in American supermarkets, devel-
oped the lust-in-TIme process which 
hu transformed manufacturing around 
the world. Such accomplishments are 
commendable, and Japan deservCIII all 
the gains it reaps from such innovation. 

However, I think most would agree 
that Japan deserves to be censured for 
directions in which it has taken other 
aspecta of American culture. I posit that

2. The Perversion of English Tax: 

Japan's English-language contortions 
are well-known to those who have 
visited the country and seen English 
slogans on T-shirts, pencil cases, note-
books, quilt covers - everything. I'm 
surprised Britain didn't levy this tar-
iff long ago, considering its stated 
concern for the mother tongue. But, 
because England has dawdled, Ameri-
cans must take the lead. Every Japa-
nese tourist entering the United States 
wearing a T-shirt which states some-
thing along the lines of the following 
should automatically be slapped with 
a $1,000 charge:

3. The Excessively Cute Import 

TtUiJf: The Japanese obsession with 
emblazoning cuddly, fuzzy, fluffy, 
doe-eyed animals on everything larger 
than a thumbtack poses a dangerous 
threat to our national lUte (what little 
of it there may be). I can't imagine 
that anyone would have grounds for 
objecting to a lOO-percent Hello KJtty

Thursday, June 1, 1995 The UCSD Guardian OPINION 5 

COMMENTARY: Once upon a time, the student government concerned itself with student needs -
now it would rather throw a concert or have a tailgate party than fight the regents 

THE A.S. SHOOTS ITSELF IN THE FOOT AGAIN 

BRENT 

J~Hl15~n 
Smells Like 
The Truth 

J have the 
feeling that 
I've been 
saying the 
same thing 
over and over 
again: "Bad 
A.S., bad 
A.S.!" 
It' s 

whiny, it's 
bitchy, it's 
vindictive, 
but it is also 
necessary, es-
pecially now 
that UCSD 
has a new 

student government deciding how to 
spend our student fees. The A.S. cer-
tainly was not thinking of its con-
stituency when it voted to reduce 
UCSD's contribution to the Univer-
sity of California Student Associa-
tion (UCSA) by one-third. 

Currently, UCSD con~ributes 
$0.50 per quarter per student to the 
UCSA, making it the cheapest stu-
dent voice throughout the UC sys-
tem by far - the cheapest, yet the 
most effective. UCSA hu made a 
greater impact on the UC regents 
than anyone UC student govern-
ment, while operating on a snuller 
budget. It is the only student orga-
nization which actually unites all 
UC students into a single body. And 
because UCSA does not throw con-
certs and other such frivolities, you 
can be sure your $0.50 is being spent 

addressing issues which directly af-
fect you, such as fee hikes. UCSA 
is the only statewide student orga-
nizations which fights for us and our 
concerns. 

Yet, while UCSA is fighting for 
us, we are fighting against it, cour-
tesy of the A.S. council throughout 
the UC system. The Berkeley and 
Davis governments, which repre-
sent two of the largest student popu-
lations, do not contribute money ~o 
the organization. In addition, 
UCSD's current contribution nearly 
matches that of UCLA's, although 
UCLA has nearly twice the number 
of students. UCSA is already pro-
jecting a $4,952 deficit this year. If 
UCSD reduces its contribution by a 
third, this deficit would be about 
$10,000. 

Some A.S. members complain 
that UCSD contributes more than 
the other campuses to fund UCSA. 
This is true - we contribute $1.50 
per student per yesr, whereas the 
average UC student contributes 
$1.35. Does the fact that we pay aD 
extra 15 cents really rub you, IS a 
student, the wrong way? When you 
consider that this year's Sun God 
Festival- which did not live up to 
previous (and cheaper) Sun God 
Festivals - cost over $40,000, does 
it really hurt us to send $20,000 to 
the UCSA, which hu been a con-
stant thorn in the regents' side all 
year long? Next year, we may be 
contributing $1.00 per year, placing 
us well below the average.

money. To a degree, concerts and 
other special events are an neces-
sary aspect of college - especially 
at UCSD, which is populated by 
"Type A" personalities who worry 
that receiving a "B" in Biology is 
going to destroy their future medi-
cal careers. More importantly, the 
A.S. helps fund student clubs and 
organizations, which add depth and 
interest to the campus. 

However, if the A.S. feels that 
the $20,000 it is sending to UCSA 
is a waste of money which would 
be better spent in conjunction with 
the $146,000 programming budget, 
it is sadly mistaken. 

One idea, introduced by former 
Intra-Fraternity Council President 
Greg Hearn, is to allocate $6,000 
toward funding tailgate parties be-
fore athletic events. "What we're 
hoping to do is get students out in 
advance, maybe have a concert or a 
barbecue or whatever," says Hearn. 
"We're just trying to get people out 
and get some life into the campus. " 
Of course, Hearn suggested the cut 
in the A.S. Finance Committee just 
before introducing the tailgate party 
proposal. 

These concerts and special 
events would mean nothing if we 
could not afford to go to school. Six 
thousand dollars for tailgate parties 
is a wute - who wants to pay 
$6,000 for a crappy band or crappy 
burgers from UCSD Catering Ser-
vices? Six thousand dollars toward 
UCSA, which knows how to handle 

a shoe-string budget, means every-
thing to us - it helps guarantee the 
organization 's mission to represent 
studenli. 

Now that the federal govern-
ment, state government and the UC 
regents have apparently joined 
forces to attack the ability of stu-
dents to have a higher education, the 
ASUCSD must take a stand. As one 
student government among eight 
others, UCSD cannot address the 
needs of UC students without the 
support of the other schools. Stu-
dents created UCSA to provide such 
a united front. 

ASUCSD is damaging this front. 
UCSA is only as strong as the 
people it represents allow it to be. 
In the eyes ofthe regents, Berkeley's 
and Davis' withdrawal from the or-
ganization weakens UCSA's cred-
ibility. Cutting UCSD's funding to 
UCSA helps to confirm this view. 
If we are not willing to stand be-
hind the UCSA, what makes us 
think the regents will take us seri-
ously? 

According to Vice President of 
Finance Edmondo Robinson, "The 
senators have the vote. They repre-
sent what the students desire .... • 
However, the majority of studenta 
- who sent a strong message by 
overwhelmingly voting against all 
Student Activity Fee increases and 
by electing A.S. President Naomi 
Falk, fonner representative to the

4. T1Ie Photography Tax: It's a 
well-known stereotype that Japa-
nese tourists take an astonishing 
number of photographs while trav-
eling, possibly even more than 
Americans. I think Japanese law re-
quires aU tourists to submit photos 
of the Golden Gate Bridge and other 
key attractions before they ar~ al-
lowed to re-enter Japan from the 
United States. Photos would pro-
vide an excellent opportunity for 
imposing fees. For example, a $500 
charge fo·r taking photos of the 
fabled bridge from the Marin look-
out point.

Japanese golfers are accustomed to 
spending the approximate cost of a

they'd probably just chalk it up to 
inflation or a tick in the exchange 
rate. 

6. The Political Blunder Fee: 
Japanese politicians often say offen-
sive remarks about the United States 
which spark an uproar on our side 
of the pond. One politician blamed 
the social malaise in the United 
States on Mrican Americans; an-
other said the U.S. economy was 
declining because American work-
ers were just plain lazy. Mler hear-

American 
~ague Best 

Has anyone looked around 
at the American League West 
lately? It was just last year -
before that hideous Great 
Strike of '94 grew like a 
cancer upon the sport of 
baseball- when critics and 
soothsayers alike tried to 
rename this" left coast" 
division. 

"We oulla call it the 
American League Worst," they 
said. "The Brewers, for God 's 
sake, could be first in Ihat 
division." 

"Do away with the West 
altogether," others moaned. 
"It's not fair that a mediocre 
team will get to go to the 
playoffs ..... 

But all of that naysaying 
has become background noise 
this season, like warbled cries 
on a finely mixed David 
Hasselhoff album. Now, the 
American League West is on 
top - the best in the business, 
the cream of the crop and the 
pinnacle of greatness. 

You don't believe me? Just 
check out those mighty 
California Angels (20-12), 
leaders of the division. 
California Angels, you say? 
Isn't that the team that gave us 
such big-time stars as Gary 
Gaetti and Gary DiSarcina? 
Well, yes, but this year is a 
different story. 

Two Angels own slots on 
the A.L. batting leaderboard: 
Chili Davis (.389) and - yes 
- DiSarcina (.330). Journey-
man pitchers Shawn Boskie (3-
0), Bob Patterson (3-1) and 
Mike Bielecki (2-1) are a 
combined 8-2, and ac Mark 
Langston is 3-0. 

Anahiem, home of rotting 
businesses and Disneyland, is 
sporting some fresh talent as 
well. J.T. Snow found his losl 
swing and Tim Salmon is 
knocking the cover off the ball 
again. 

But what about the Seattle 
Mariners (18-13)? Seatlle has 
Edgar Martinez swalling a 
whopping .351 at the plate. 
And don't forget Jay Buhner, 
who, at presenl, is looking like 
a bigger version of Rambo. As 
soon as The Junior is back, the 
"Mariners will no doubt score 
even more: 

Randy Joh~son anchors the 
strong Seattle staff. Johnson, a 
seven-foot behemoth, has 
finally stepped out of previous 
years' shadows - if that's 
possible, considering he 
creates a fairly big one himself 
- of bean balls, walks and 
wild pitches. Johnson is the 
heir to the Nolan Ryan throne, 
currently leading the league 
with 62 strikeouts. (His nearest 
competitor has 49.) 

Next in the West is 
Oakland. Tallying a 17-15 clip 
so far, the A's are tied with 
Texas for the worst record in 
their division. Maybe I'm apig 
dummy, but since when do

SPRING INTO ACTION 
SENIOR SALUTES: The Guardian bidsfarewell 
to seven of the UCSD hardballers who will be 
leaving the team after this successful season 
By Seen Rahlml 
Staff Writer 

All of the seniors leaving the 
Triton baseball team this year have 
one thing in common: winning. 

Throughout their careers at 
UCSD, AI DelFavero, Mark 
Hartmann, Steve Height, Ben 
Mangan, Chris Miyake, Dan 
O' Brien and Eric Quandt have en-
joined the spoils of victory. 

The Triton sluggers made the 
Division III West Regional playoffs 
in 1992 and again in 1994. They 
advanced to the Division III World 
Series in 1994, after coming back 
from a two-game deficit to defeat 
California Lutheran University. 

It is no coincidence that the re-
cent success of the team has occured 
during the careers of these great 
players. The 1995 season was a bit 
disappointing, as the Tritons failed 
to make the playoffs. But if you ask 
any other Division III team, it would 
love to have accumulated UCSD's 

solid record. The Tritons finished 
23-13 overall, with an outstanding 
road record of 10-8. 

The leaders of the outgoing 
UCSD seniors would have to be 
three four-year veterans: starting 
pitcher Heighl, shortstop Miyake 
and second baseman Quandt. 

"I slarted out as a reliever my 
freshman year, and I've started the 
last three [years]," Height said. 
"It was a great senior year for me. 
We played well with what we had. 
It was a big transition from the 
.past years. When you have guys 
looking up to you, it's a great feel-
ing." 

Height, a second-team Ali-Re-
gional selection in 1994, is now 
fifth all-time in wins apd ERA for 
UCSD. He is also seventh all-time 
in innings pitched. 

Chris Miyake piled up tons of 
offensive numbers and provided 
steady defense in the middle of the 
diamond. As last year's AII-Re-

Mark Hartmann: 
The right-handed 
hurler was an big 
part of the fine 
pitching staff over 
the last three years, 
once taking a n~ 
hitter to the eighth 
inning of a game. 
His career record is 
a solid 13-7. 

Steve Hellht: The southpaw starting pitcher was the leader of the 
staff in the 1995 season. Height's career stats include a 2.99 
ERA and a 18-11 record. In addition, he recorded 113 K's in 200 
innings for UCSD over his star-studded career. 
gional shortstop, Miyake finished 
second in all-time batting average 
and tied for first all-time with 12 
career triples for UCSD. 

"I had twelve at-bats my fresh-
man year and now I'm leaving with 
the second-best average," Miyake 
said. "I would have to say that my 
most memorable moment was when 
we came back to beat Cal Lu at 

Dan O'BrIen: The 
Tritons' starting first 
baseman was a 
force at the plate 
and the leader of 
the infield. O'Brien 
came up with many 
clutch hits during 
the season, helping 
UCSD win some 
close ball games. 

regionals." 
Eric Quandt was the heart of the 

ballclub. He leaves UCSD with the 
third-most steals ever and the sev-
enth-highest batting average. 

"It's been a great four years," 
Quandt said. "I'll never forget our 
comeback against Cal Lu." 

And we will never forget these 
outstanding players. 

BenM ... n: An 
outstanding relief 
pitcher, Mangan 
struck out the first 
and last batter he 
faced over his three-
year career. In 29 
Innings of work, he 
tallied an amazingly 
high ratio of 22 
strikeouts.

FAST FINISH, TOO LATE 
SENIOR SAWTES: 
Young Tritons lose pair 
of starters, but have 
solid core for next year 
By D.n Kraft 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD softball team's year 
could best be summarized as a tale 
of two seasons - two very different 
seasons to be sure. The Tritons en-
dured a rocky start to their schedule 
by losing 12 of their first 14 con-
tests, dropping hopelessly out of the 
playoff race. 

U nfortu natel y 
for the UCSD slug-
gers, they did not 
begin to compete at 
the playoff-caliber 
level until that goal 
was well out of 
reach. 

"We didn't meet 
our expectations for 
this season," Head 
Coach Patricia 
Gerckenssaid. "We 
lost a lot of close 
games and a lot of 
games we should 
have won." 

The Tritons are 
graduating two 
multi-talented stars: 

With this concern behi nd it, how-
ever, the UCSD softball crew began 
to play up to its potential in the 
second half ofthe three-month-Iong 
campaign. 

The turning point final!j came, 
as it did last year, at the Spring 
Rebel Games in Orlando, FL. The 
Tritons compiled a solid 3-3 mark at 
this highly touted meeting of soft-
ball teams from across the nation. 
Moreover, they apparently regained 
some of the confidence lost during 
their sour start. 

Lisa Gil and April 
\¥i lIiams. Gil was a 
pitcher and second 
baseman, and Will-
iams was an out-

u .. Gil: A four-year letter-winner, Gil is an 
Triton great. She Is near the top of the UCSD 
record books in K's (sixth), complete games 
(fourth with 33) and games pitched (seventh). 

UCSD recovered from its di-
sastrous 2-12 start to amass a 13-9 
record in the second half of the 
year, including I red-hot stretch 
run, during which it notched seven 
victories in 10 games. The Tri-
tons' strong finish enabled the 
UCSD squad to climb within ear-
shot of the magical . .500 barrier 
with a ]5-2] mark. 

fielder and substitute infielder. 
Williams and Gil were both 

four-year letter-winners. Gil's ab-
sence will be felt on tbe mound, 
where she was near the top of the 
Triton record books in strikeouts, 
complete games and games 
pitched. In addition, Gil was an 
offensive threat, placing third on 
the team in batting average this 
season. Luckily for UCSD, the rest 
of the Triton squad is young. 

"We are returning a strong 
nucleus of players next season," 
Gerckens said.

BEST: The West is 
finally on top 
Continued from paJe 7 
winning percentage. But the absur-
dity doesn't stop there-Texas and 
Oakland are better than all other 
American League teams, except for 
division leaders. 

Oakland can't boast of any bat-
ting average standouts, but the A's 
can pack a big punch - Geronimo 
Berroa is second in runs (28), and 
Mark McGuire is third in runs (26), 
third in RBis (31) and first in 
homeruns (]2). 

While Damon Stottlemyre racks 
up the K's (42), Onteveros tallies 
the consistent wins (5-1) for the 
A's. To top it off, Oakland has speed 
in Stan Javier, who has snatched up 
more stolen bases (8) than Rickey 
Henderson so far. 

My beloved Texas Rangers (]7-
15), the last of the Western Divsion 
teams, are on a hot streak of late. 
The Rangers, playing in the beauti-
ful Ballpark (that's all that needs to 
be written about this gem of a field) 
have won to of their last 13. But in 
the West, that 's not league-leading 
material. 

The Rangers have perhaps the 
most deadly hitting attack in base-
ball - Juan Gonzales, Will Clark, 
Mickey Tettleton, Otis Nixon and 
Dean Palmer lead the charge . 

As for pitching, about the only 
speck of talent on the roster is Kenny 
Rogers, country music star and 
owner of a league-leading 33-
straight scoreless-innings streak. 

American League Worst? Hah! 
It's the American League Best.

fraterni1y teams lhat met in the first round of last week'llFC Champion-
ships. The Wimps (Sigma Chi) prevailed 10-5 and then proceeded Ie blGw

Thu-June 1 at Bpm (NCR Mid West) 
Comments: This is a flip-flop affair between the :hird and four1h seeded teams in the 

AA tournament. Either can win ~. 8'Jth feature fair pitching and good d. 
tense and can hit when called upon. Any of the four teams in the loser 's 
bracket of this doubl.elim tournament could come all the way back. Top-
seeded Pimpstappers might be the one.

(9-0) leam makes all the plays in the field and hits just enough. ThIrY beet 
a solid Surf Kitty team 2·1 in the semifinal, last week. The Hunters from 
Hootersville know how to beet you with their bats and are loaded with all-
around athletes, but we say pitching and defense pr8llail

Sat.June 3 at 4pm (NCR Mid West) 
Comments: With the Women's tournament just gelling started this weekend, the pr. 

tournament IIlJII*1S8 is hardly rising above the freshly mown gr_ at 
NCR. Season long powerhcIuse Monchichis have devastated the league 
with wins like 47'() and 29-{). The race is on for 2nd and should be d. 
cided by the winner 01 the game above.

This hard fought battle brought out plenty of whistles and flags agalnet both 
squads. In the end , the size (certainly not the skilQ of BUTIAFUOCO wore 
down a frustrated SC team. The final score _10-8.

Rubber RIdIrI 
The best story of the entire playoffs wae the determinatiOn of these gals. Not 
picked to gel out of the 1 st round, they just kept plugging. They won their 
playa" opener by 2 goals, the HITIi·final by 1 goal and beat heavily favored 
TANK GIRLS by 2 In the title game. Wendy Allen and Carrie McKellegan led

Drops a New Beat 
Techno artist takes a different direction on latest release 

Ithough the 29-year-old Moby 
(Richard Melville Hall) was 
one of techno's forerunners 
when he began performing 

in the late '80s, he doesn'l 
consider himself part of 
the genre anymore. His 

new album, Everything is Wrong, which mixes 
jungle and house beats with punk rock and 
classical music, perhaps signals the death of 
techno or at least its inevitable mutation into 
other forms of music. Another sign that techno 
has changed is that on his national tour, Moby, 
once a frequent rave performer, will play clebs 
instead of raves. 

"I still like the rave scene, but most of the 
techno that's been madeoverthe past few years 
has bored the hell out of me," Moby said during 
a recent phone interview. "The music that gets 
played at nightclubs and raves is interesting to 
dance to, but it doesn't mean anylhing 10 meon 
an emotional level anymore. I'd rather listen to 
Courtney Love. It's disappointing to me be· 
cause there are parts of the world where techno 
and dance music are really exciting. It's just 
that in most parts of America it has become too 
esoteric and too conservative." 

Although Moby's new album carries the 
bleak title Everything is Wrong and includes a 
list of ways in which the world's natural re-
sources are being destroyed, Moby insists he is 
not entirely pessimistic about the future. 

"I feel that pessimism is the product of 
wild optimism," he said. "When I 
see how much potential hu-
man beings have and how 
routinely it's squan-

dered, it bums me out 
"Human beings, for all their failings, are 

fascinating creatures - frustrating but also 
really fascinating. What drives me really crazy 
is how simple it would be for things to be better, 
It's just a matter of being honest with you_If 
and others." 

On his current tour, Moby, who usually 
performs solo, is accompanied by two percus· 
sion players. 

"The computer is not the most interesting 
performing partner," he said. "It's nice to have 
human interaction on the stage and hearing 
whatexcitessomeoneelseaboutmyson~. We 
do all these punk rock son~. It 's a strange 
performance and very sweaty. I'd much rather 
get on stage and smash equipment and jump 
around than do the more intro· 
spective stuff." 

Moby, a former 
philosophy major 
al the Univer-
sity of Con· 

B Y Jeff N i e s e I , 
Hiatus Editor 

necticul, cries out for human compassion on 
wn~ such as "All That I Need is to be Loved" 
and "Everytime You Touch Me." A devout 
Christian, Moby said that even tbough most of 
his songs are instrumentals, the references to 
his religious beliefs still emerge, 

"I think my religious beliefs come through. 
Sometimes in a very straightforward way and 
sometimes in a very ambiguous way. You 
could say there's an expression of religious 
beliefs in a beautiful sunset even though there 
are no lyrics. I think that [the song] 'God 
moving over the Face of the Waters' is like a 
hymn with no lyrics. I'm not very good at 
writing issue-oriented lyrics and singing, so I 
have to rely on more ambiguous forms of 
expression. "

Following what has be-
come a French style of 
storytelling, Techine creates 
a natural picture of everyday 
life in a small town. Instead 
of attempting to sensational-
ize the plot, Techine offers a genuine 
story by disclosing the true-to-Iife con-
versations, interactions and experiences 
of these youngsters. 

While Wild Reeds is a pleasant 
change from otherfilrns which are more 
glorified and less realistic, it lacks ex-
citing or climactic moments. The plot 
never comes to a boil ,so thefilm'space 
is slow and placid from beginning to 
end. 

The focus of the film shifts from one 
person to the other, creating a type of 
character montage. Francois (Gael 
Morel) and Maite(Elodie Bouchez) are 
best friends from the very beginning of 
the film. 

While those around them wonder 
whether they are more than just friends, 
they continue to believe in the under-

While it is interesting 
to see how each ofthechar-
acters mature and deal with 
their experiences, the film 
never comes together in 
any cohesive way. 

.Many of the fragmented mo-
ments from each of the different 
characters' lives are fragmented. 
Subsequently, their development 
also appears partial. In the end, the 
audience still does not feel particu-
larly COMected to anyone in the 
film. 

Though Techine introduces pro-
vocative themes and leaves plenty 
of room for personal interpretations, 
he does not choose to offer any 
conclusive or deliberate messages. 

Wild Reeds. a Golden Globe en-
try for Best Foreign Language Film 
and the official French selection for 
the Academy Awards' Best Foreign 
Language Film, is playing at the 
Hillcrest CinerlllS. For more infor-

goes to France to bury his father with 
his World War II comrades. How-

Under these morbid circumstances, 
Mickey meets Ellen (Debra Winger~ 
the airline representative who not only 
helps find and tramport the casket, 
but also becomes his lover. 

Dancing on the banks of the Seine 
and strolling under the Eiffel Tower

Jove. Yet, their vacation is a far cry 
from the reality of their everyday lives. 

In a refreshing change from other 
current romantic flicks (While You 
Were Sleeping and French 
Kiss ~ Forget Paris offers a 
look into what happens af-
ter you fall madly in love. 
Dealing with issues such as 
hectic work schedules, 
spousal needs and desires 
and unwanted in-laws, the 
movie tackles big issues 
with big lauglw. 

Crystal, who produced, directed 
and wrote most of the script, has a 
great talent for combining the normal

with the completely absurd. Winger is 
in her comedic best when she ~i­
dentaUy glues a pigeon to her head. 

Though Forget Paris is filled with 
some great acting hy Crys-
tal and Winger, the high-
light of the film is its narra-
tive structure. Mickey's 
friends tell the story of his 
romance with Ellen, adding 
their own embellishments. 
The story is told much in the 
same way stories about 
everyone's love lives are 

told: through gossip.

aters throughout San Diego.
