Kinko's, Publishers 
Reach Agreement 
• Kinko's officials charge competitors 
with ooo-compliance to copyright laws 
By DavId Snow 
Guardian Repotter 

Kinko's Graphic Corporation. ordered by a federal 
court ruling to comply with copyright laws, has reached an 
out.of-coun settlement with the Association of American 
Publishers (AAP), which filed suit against Kinko's last 
spring. 

Kinko's, which publishes anthologies for college courses 
including some at UCSD, has agreed to pay $1.875 million 
in statutory damages and legal fees to the AAP in retum for 
termination of the AAP's lawsuit. 

Earlier this year, the AAP filed a copyright infringement 
suit against two Kinko's stores in New York City, claiming 
that Kinko's used books in course anthologies without the 
permission of the publishers. 

Since the federal coon made its ruling seven months ago, 
Kinko's says that all of the course reading materials it 
prepares now have the publisher's permission for reprinting. 

However, according to Kinko's, its competitors still do 
not comply with copyright laws. 

Asa result of the ruling, someUCSDcourse readers were 
delayed while Kinko's waited for permission from the 
various publishing companies. 

1berefot'e, some professors switched to Cal Copy, which 
also has a store near campus, and which reponed an increase 
in business after Kinko's abrupt change in policy. The

UCSD Center Receives $2.2 Million in Funding 
_.~tbma and allergy research to focus 00 allergies in San Diego's Indochinese populations

StIIIf MHrar 

1be UCSD Medical Center has 
received a research grant for ap-
proximately $2.2 million in c0n-
junction with recognition by the 
Nationallnstitufe of Health (NIH) 
as an Asthma and Allergic Disease 
Cooperative Disease Center. 

By receiving this distinction, 
UCSDbecouaoneofonly 12 medi-
cal centers in the nation to be recog-
nized by the Nlli for its study of 
asthma and allergic diseases, par-
ticularly in minority populations. 

1be grant was awarded to the

university to in al-
lergic inflannnation and antibody 
formulation, along with funding a 
study of asthma in the Indochinese 
population. 

A government repon estimates 
that deaths caused by asthma to-
taled over 4,000 in 1987. Approxi-
mately 17.5 million people in the 
United States suffer from asthma. 
with thernonality rate due to asthma 
rising notably among non-whites 
living in inner cities. 

According to Hans Spiegleberg, 
a professor of pediatrics at UCSD 
and co-principal investigator of the 

NIH studies, "At the present time, 
the NIH does not know whether 
there's a difference between whites, 
blacks, Hispanics and Indochinese" 
in terms of asthma incidence. 

Stephen Wasserman,chairofthe 
Depanment of Medicine at UCSD 
and co-principal investigator with 
Spiegleberg, proposed the study 
because of San Diego's high 
Indochinese population. The study 
will concentrate on examining the 
genetic and environmental condi-
tions that cause asthma. 

"We are panicularly excited at 
the opponunity to study the inci-

dence, severity and causative 
mechanism of asthma in San 
Diego's Indochinese co""munity," 
Wasserman said. 

Another focus of the NIH grant 
is a study of the regulation of anti-
bodies that cause allergies. 
Spiegleberg will head this ponion 
of the research. 

Spiegleberg will be tudying the 
effects of antibodies in stimulating 
allergic disease with a panicular 
emphasis on Immunoglobulin E 
(IgE). IgE is instrumental in caus-
ing allergic diseases like asthma

According 10 Arrhenius, an-
other allrdClion of lhe cenler is 
that ''the centershould bring more 
quality graduale sludenls and 
post-docloral students 10 the 
area." 

While there i a plan for the 
inclusion of graduate and POSI-
doctoral students in lhe resean;h, 
possible undergraduale roles in 
the research has yel 10 be de-
cided. 

Arrhenius said he believes thaI 
undergraduale participation is 
important and lherefore will be 
encouraged. 

He added lhat researchers in 
the exobiology center will per-
suade students 10 follow research 
careers in exobiology and other 
fundamental science fields. 

The research leaders, said 
Arrhenius, know thaI "not all 
ideas aboullheoriginsoflife will 
be discovered within the nellt 
few years allhecenter." 

However, they hope to con-
tribule 10 the knowledge of the 
various processes that occured 
when life began. 

He added lhallhe cenler in-
lends 10 publish its findings on 
Ihe origins ofJife, as well as give 
local seminars about the work 
done at the center, hold inlema-
tional conferences and interact 
with the high schools in the area. 

''The publishers will beaftenhem 
next," said Kurt Koenig, vice presi-
dent and legal counsel of Kinko·s. 
He said Ihat Kinko's was up against 
"compelitors who are not playing 
by Ihe same rules." 

However, Reza Mansoor, gen-
eral manager of the Cal Copy Store 
near UCSD. which provides ser-
vices for many university courses, 
said thaI his tore always gets the 
publisher' consent before printing 
a course packeL 

''They [Kinko'sl can claim what-
ever they want," he said, "We go by 
the law." 

But last April. Mansoon lold the 
Guardian Ihat the court ruling only 
applied to Ihe Kinko's chain, and 
that in most cases Cal Copy would 
continue 10 reproduce material un-
der the "Fair Use" clause. 

Before Ihe court ruling, both 
Kinko 's and Cal Copy relied on the 
"Fair Use" clause of the 1976Copy-
right Act when reproducing materi-
als without the consent of lhe pub-
lisher. 

Under the "Fair Use" clause, 
published material can be copied 
withoul permission under lhe fol-
lowing conditions: if the reproduc-
I ion is made for non-profit purposes, 
if it does nolseriously allerlhe price 
of Ihe book and if Ihe copied mate-
rial is a certain lenglh in relation 10 

. publishers. 
In addition, it was discovered 

that the two copy shops invol ed 
had falsely assured theircliems that 
copyrighl compliance was being 
handled. 

An AAP press release reports 
that the group h:J ~, after sev n 
momhs of liligation, agreed to end 
the suit if Kinko ' s will not allelllpt 
to appeallhe cOllrt deci ion. 

The AAP has also agreed not to 
sue Kinko's for other incidents of 
copyright infringement prior to the 
date of the ruling, March 29. 1991. 

'The proces of gaining copy-
righl pennission can be time con-
suming and expensive, taking up to 
30 days and cosling between 20 and 
50 cems per reproduced page, de-
pending on thepublishingcompany. 
This cost is passed on to students. 

According to Koenig, Kinko's 
now pays millions of dollru each 
year in royalties. 

As Slated in the AAP press re-
lease, copyright "encourages cre-
ativity by ensuring that authors and 
publishers are compensated fort heir 
original works." 

Kinko's began by catering 
moslly to college campuses wilh its 
Professor Publishing se.rvice. 

Now, wilh over 580 stores na-
tionwide, only aboul 180 are near a

A.5. WATCH: 1991 

Why Does the A.S. Need .. Advancf!I 
It 's difficult not to be cynical when writing about the A.S. 

Council. Student government at any institution of learning is 
cursed with the reputation Of impotence. As a policy-making 
organi'lntion, the A.S. i es entially at the mercy of the good 
graces of the university admini tration. Any major decision made 
by the A.S. mu t be approved by A sistant Vice-Chancellor of 
Undergraduate Affairs Tom Tucker, who answers directly to 
Vice-Chancellor Jo eph Watson. 

As a lobbying organization, the A.S. has slightly more clout. 
But, again, students' intere t are al ways at the mercy of the 
powers that be. The UC Regents and the state legislature will 
weigh tudent claims in relation to other pressing interest . The 
greater good of the university, and all that it entails, does not 
necessarily equate with the greater good of the tudents. 

The A.S. is most effel..ive a a funding organization. Empow-
ered by the $ 13.50 activity fee collected from each of UCSD' 
over 14',00) undergraduates, the A.S. has a rather substantial sum 
of money to play with throughout lhe year - approximately 
$700,000. A ubstantial ponion of that money - roughly 21 

perce~l - i u ed to fund progrdmming, which includes the A.S . 
film series, noon concens and TGs. 

WHit~ the A.S. may be mo t effective as a funding organiza-
tion, it is clearly not always successful in fu nding programs it feel s 
woul&1ae in the be t interests of the students. The recent (and 
seemingly unending) controversy surrounding the TG demon-
strJIes (hat the students clearly do not have a ay in how their fees 
are spent. 

A a result, the A.S. is forced to make "safe" expenditures. The 
best and most recent example of thi is the A.S. funding of the 
Ad,'allce-a publication which, in years past, has been liulemore 
than a tudent fee-funded orgy of self-indlllgence for a group ;' 
which. except in rare in tance" ha.~ had little to show for itself 
except for its grandstanding. 

Thi year'sAdl'tJllce is no different trom years past, except that 
it includes a daily planner and a Ii ' t of several phone numbers 
whi h may be useful to those lucky students who are able to find 
(\ copy. 

Fl ipping through the Advance' 83 page, students will find 
lengthy bio on all of the A.S. officers - complete wilh Guardian 
file photos - and everal flowery trealises on what wonderful 
th ings they \lave in store for the unsuspecting student body Ihis 
year. 

The Ad,'allce came out several weeks late this year (which is, 
in a ense, a sub tantial improvement from last year when it didn't 
come out at all), and was reportedly distributed last week in and 
around the various residence halls. But if the Advance was 
distributed, as A.S. Vice President Administrative Mike Holmes 
has indicated, then it wasn't distributed very well. A CUIWry 
investigation of the Revelle College residence halls failed to 
uneanh a single copy. 

But what is particularly noteworthy about this year's Advance 
is its cost: between $4,000-$5,000 for a limited run of 4.000 
copies. Subtract the roughly $800 dollars received in advertising 
revenues, and we see that this year's pat on the back - or, 
"outreach" as the A.S. prefers to call it - cost somewhere in the 
neighborhood of $3,200-$4,200. 

Perhaps we should be thankful that the A.S. even bothered to 
solicit advertising at all . At least it deferred some of the costs, even 
if it ~unted to a little less than one-fifth of the total expense. 

The more pressing question, however, is why we even need an 
Advance at all. Holmes concedes that the cost of this year's 
Advance may have been a Iinle excessive, but argues that if 
students use it, then the cost is worthwhile. True enough. But 
limited availability and seemingly poor dtstribution on campus 
would tend to weaken Holmes' otherwise valid assertion. 

Making students aware of what services and in~titutions are 
available to them is a good idea. To be sure, the A.S. offers some 
outstanding services, such as A.S. Lecture Notes, Soft Reserves, 
Assorted Vinyl, U.S. Grants and others. As a funding organiza-
tion, the A.S. provide an invaluable service to the student body 
by allocating funds to groups and project which otherwise might 
not exisl if not for its assi lance. 

But such "awarenes " need not come in the form of an 
extravagant package like the Advallce. The money is better spent 
el:.ewhere.

COMMENTARY 

Here We Go Again: PC Article #4,509 
I rancmber the JOOd old days 

when I was a first and second year 
undc:rJrIduate who could freely use 
the tenD "Politically ComIct" and 
not fed like a riabI-wm,er. 

That was line yars sao. when 
PC was III inside joke on CIIDpUL 
My friends and I died Ihe term 10 
describelbeDeldy hippiestbll would 
pull out a IOIIp box in the middle of 
a class IIId prooeed 10 educaIe us all 
on some typical progressive issue. 
We did DOl object 10 Ihe c:onIeII& of 
these mini-1ecIures, but the presen-
taIion. It was arropnt and simplis-
tic. 

Now aIllbat has chanpd and PC 
is the campus risht's most pofem 
rbetoric:alclevice against the left. PC 
has been plastered everywhere. 
thanks to Ihe nalional media. the 
presided and the JRCOCious and 
half-baked views of Dinesh 
D'Souza, a conservative Iwninary 
for the '90s. Our private joke has 
been let out of the bag. 

I open my mouth and before I 
can finish a sentence I am accused 
of being "Politically Correct" This 
monstrosity of a tenn has been glued 
to my behind by campus right-
wingers whocaJJ meaJoe McCarthy 
wannabe. 

What I like so much about the 
right in this country is their pen-
chant for flair, energy and initiative. 
Before an issue can be delineated in 
its complexity it is immediately 
packaged in bright colors (prefer-
ably red, white and blue) and sent 

. ~- .. - ... . 
, ' ... :''' ..... ... 

otfto some incredibly efficied pub-
lie .elations fum for distribution. 
My complainl is that these born 
apia champions of freedom of 
speech (exoepI for fIa& burners) are 
Ihe same people who elected a presi-
dent who used nICiaI fearand hatred 
as a campaign slog&n-

The anti-PC heroes have a mis-
placed passion. They're fighting the 
people who protest campus radio 
shows that make racial jokes about 

~Americans. They'.e fight-
ing feminists who want to "take 
back the night" from violenoeagainsc 
women. 

These champions are guardians 
of "the canon," that holy essence of 
literary greatness to which only 
white men can aspire. Nothing else 
matters - everything else is Juan 
Valdez and his cute donkey. They 
don't want to know about women, 
about Chicanos and Salvadorenas. 
or about South African literature. 
They don't want to know about 
gays. 

Quite simply, they want to deal 
solely with the suburban familiarity 

of their own background and not be 
challenpd intellectually on any-
thing else. 

As an undergraduate (I'm now a 
graduate student) I was exposed to 
attocious insensitivity by whites 
toward ocher peoples and men t~ 
ward women. One of my peers 
scrawled a swastika on a Jewish 
girl's door. Another one date-raped 
a woman at a party. 

In the papers I read about other 
institutions and their honor stories. 
An African-American woman is 
traumatizedanddrivenout of school 
by hate mail and threats. Every-
where I looked I saw tension and 
miscommunication. 

"Multiculturalism" was bom out 
of an eifooto deal with these issues 
in a construcIive way. The point 
was to by 10 bridge the gap between 
groups through education, discus-
sion and cultural interaction. 

While scores of hurt conserva-
tives revel in labeling liberals "PC" 
in retaliation to what theyequivo-
cally perceive as personal affronts, 
some of us are talking about the real 
problems. 

It's adifficult space to negotiate, 
defining aggression and disentan-
gling it from "freedom of speech," 
which must be defended. What our 
our curriculum should be is an 
equally daunting task. 

Meanwhile, the comfy rich, after 
12 years going on 16 of conserva-
tive presidents somersault on the 
sidelines and cry "PC! PC! PC!"

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 

1hePelsonallrnpactofDate Rape 
EdifDr: 

ID the wake of tbe IOC*Il confU1Jl8lioo hearings for Supreme 
Coun Justice Clarence ~ tb=has bcenan influx ofpublicity 
regarding the occurrenc:es of sexual hatassment in our society. Not 
only scxuaI harassment in Ihe work place, as was the case with . 
Professor AnitaHill's awlsations againstJudBe Thomas. butalso-
and more imponandy - harassment in the fonn of date, or"acquain-
1aDCe" rape. 

I am in complete suppon of this attempt 10 enljghten the public. 
However, instead of being presented only wilh statistics or second 
bind ac:c:oul'll. I finDly believe that people need 10 hear from a 
SU1'Vi~iDorderlDfully underItandsucha vioIcntcrime. That is why 
I am writing this letter today. 

The general pubIk tends 10 envision rape as a crime in which the 
victim is the one to blame. Contrary to this belief. the victim isn't 
"askina" for iL For no matter bow a pCISOO is dressed. acting or what 
kind of eovironmeol they are in, 00 ODe individual has the right to 
force themselves sexually upon another. 

Ofteotimes in Ihe case of dale rape. it is as simple as this: the 
aggressor wants to have sex. and their victim does not. In my case, 
my aaac:ker was my boyfriend. When I wanted him to stop. he 
refused. 

Many people see rape as a physically violent crime, one in which 
Ihe victim is threatcoed with even greater physical harm if they don't 
submiL I wasoottbleateoed in such a way, and after the fact. hedidn', 
even believe it was rape. Believe me when I teU you that it was. 

The public in pneral. and college students in partiCUlar, need to 
be aware of the fact that "rape" constitutes any fonn of unwanted 
sexual advances or activity. It leaves a person feeling wonhless, 
empIy. used and betrayed. 

Without having personally experienced the pain, it is difficult for 
other people to imagine the extent to which these feelings can scar an 
individual. It is imperative that these aspects of the crime are brought 
to the public view. People need to realize the full spectrum~f rape. 
1bey need to be aware not only of statistics and sel( pefense 
tedlDiques. but also of the more personal side of the issue. 

Pahaps a more infonned, humanilarian view will briqg about 
greater public awareness and understanding. . '~I

she added. • . 

The PLUS program is not 
aimed at students or professors, 
who already have free access to 
library resources. 

'1t's more of an extension of 
servicea to the public outside the 
university. [Students] probably 
wouJdn't have a 101 of motivation

it enables an excellent team of sci-
entislS to further investigate the un-

Wassennansaid, "and 10 apply their 
knowledge to benefit patients in San 
Diego and beyond." 

PLUS is intended for "some-
one who is not affiliated with the I

that," she added. 

The cost for PLUS services 
varies. "In general, a phoIocopy

othy back up every time she'd stan 
to slip out of her chair, since the 
nurses ignored her. ' 

Second: old habits die hard. One 
patient, Ruth, had her relatives 
smuggle bottles of whiskey in for 
her. A male patienl came 10 our 
ward 10 use the telephone - he had 
to call his wife just to tell her to 
remember which horses to bet on 
for him that dayl Couldn't he have 
taken some time off from gambling 
while in the hospital? 1 guess not. 

Third: one should noI watch 
"Kramer vs. Kramer" (or any other 
tear-jelter) whengettingoveratrau-
maticexperienc:ewhile ina hospital 
bed thousands of miles away from 
home with only your sister to visit 
you -I foolishly did this and ended 
upcrying uncontrollably for several 
hours. 

There was one good thing about 
my hospital stay - it was paid for 
by the British govenunent! 

I've had three of the pins re-
moved since then, but 1 haven't been 
h<meback riding. 1 think you'd agree 
that iI's really not my speed.

Swartz (35th, 27:24), Mark Yuen 
(42nd, 28: 17) and Nathan Johnson 
(49th. 31 :55). 

Johnson had eiglu stitches in his 
foot as late as Thursday and the~ 
had been some doubt as to whether 
or not he would race. 

The women's race was expected 
to feature CPSLO, the premier 
women's cross country team in Di-
vision n, and the Mustangs didn't 
disappoint They received a ~ 
two finish from Kristina Hand 
(17:11) and Melanic Hiatt (17:22) 
- and placed all five runners in 
their scoring group in the top 10-
to pace the field, 30 points ahead of 
runner-up UC Riverside. Melissa 
Pardini was third, three seconds be-
hind Hiatt, to lead the Highlanders. 

Cal State Los Angeles (nmked 
No. 16 in Division m placed third 
with 70 points. The Golden Eagles 

we~ led by Kimberly Ojeda. who 
finished eighth in a time of 18: 12. 
CSULA had been something of an 
unknown entilY entering the race, 
because it had nol raced locally all 
year. 

Cal Poly Pomona finished fourth 
with a score of 119. Stanforth had 
said before the race thai he didn'l 
expecllhe Broncos to be much of a 
factor, but a sixth-place finish from 
Krislin Harkins (I 8:04) helped CPP 
squeak. past the Tritons by two 
points. 

UCSD was led by Erin Adams, 
who finished 171h in a timeofl8:50, 
and Karen Hinkle( 18th, 18:51). The 
Tritons' scoring group was rounded 
oul by Tracy Cole (28th, 19:50), 
Katie Jamieson (29th, 20:0 I) and 
Danielle Eigner (35th, 20: 13). 

Other finishers for UCSD in-
cluded Karen Longyear (37th, 
20:53), Jennifer Cullen (381h, 
21:03). Jamie King (40th, 21:13) 
and Janelle Coxford (43rd, 21 :58).

The Bruins' stifling pressure led 
to several turnovers by the Tritons, 
who looked to be all but ~y to 
give up the contesl. With four min-
utes remaining in the third period, 
hole guard Kevin Vance received 
his third kickout, and as a result was 
ejected from the game. A livid 
Harper could do Iinle rnore than 
watch in frustration. 

UCSD has traditionally been a 
SIrOng fourth-<tuarterleam. however, 
and this was no exception. With 
four minutes remaining in the game, 
Brown unloaded from outside to 
give UCSD ils first goal in more 
than seven minutes of play. 

A minule later Go-odrich 
smacked the canvas from the right 
side and UCSD pulled to within 
Ih~at 10-7. 

A quick Ua.Agoai puttheBru-
ins back up by four, but Nalu un-
loaded an unexpected shot from four 
meters out and Goodrich skipped 
another one past Hacken to shrink 
the deficit to two. Time, however, 
was on the side of the Bruins as the 
clock expired, and they managed to 
hang on for the win. 

Goodrich finished the evening 
with three goals for UCSD. Ua.A's

worried. "We tried to do a lot of 
risky things," Dannevilt said. "We

In fact, the inconsislency did 
nothing to shake Dannevilt 's confi-

make solid plays, we're tough ... 
Nobody in the WCSI thinks they can

"Ilhink we should have beat them,"

Host First-Round 
Late last night, according to 

UCSD Spons Information Director 
Bill Gannon, the NCAA seleclion 
committee called 10 check on the

BUI evidently there are just so 
many stupid things that you can 
make a person do ... because with 
Tyson, they had to reson to giving 
him a physical injury. That's the 
tough thing about voodoo-there's 
no real cure for the pain. There's no 
such thing as a voodoo cut man. 

Though I suppose it could be James 
Brown. Gannon said that the start times 

for the men 's first-round game and 
the women's regional final -sched-
uled to be played the same day -
will be delermined later in the week. 
UCSD finished (he regular season 
last week with a 14-4- 1 record after 
shutting oul Pomona-Pitzer 5-0. 

It was during the interview with 
the Post reporter that the man re-
vealed he had been working for both 
the Tyson and Holyfield camps. The 
man refused, however, to identify a 
third party that was also involved in 
buying Tyson voodoo dolls. 

Robin Givens? No, the man said, 

Think this story is a bit far-
fetched? Well. maybe so. But how 
else do you explain the situation in

without the Voodoo theory, we can

The Tritons tightened up in the

The period was hiahliahfed by bril-

On the night, Askeland had three

"Kristi gave us a spark," Dannevik

Askeland and the rest of the Tri-
tons bauled back to tie the game at 
14-14. Westmont went ahead 15-

side-out and then sent Van Duyne 
back to serve. 

Van Ouyne not only served the 
Tritons out, but finished the game 

off with a solid kill to give UCSD a 
17-15 win and the match. "We're

But at the airport. our voodoo 
courier was intercepted by men 
working for Dan Duva. Holyfield's 
promoter. A week later, the man 
from Haiti was back in the states, 
this time with a new doll - one of 
Don King. Not long after, he was 
making trips with Duva and Holy-
field dolls for King, and more Ty-
son dolls for Duva. He was working 
both sides of the street. 

Now, you may be asking your-
self this question: why all the dolls? 
Can't voodoo dolls be used over and 
over again, like Three's Company 
plots? 

Suretheycan ... most of the time. 
But only in certain areas. Sticking a 
doll in the leg or in the arm is really 
minorstuff-the voodoo energy of 
thedoll will remain strong fora long

But the boxing people lte harsh 
on their dolls. Feeling pain in the 
extremities is nothing to boxing 
weasels, after all. No, the pugilistic 
folk tend to stick pins in people's 
heads, where body energy is the 
strongest. A pin in Tyson's head on

him do things he shouldn 'tdo. Apin

UCSD had nwnerous scoring 
opponunities in the quarter but 
couIdn'tcapitalizeonseveralUCLA 
ejections. The Bruins weren't help-
ing the situation either as strong 
pressure defense left the Tritons 
desperalely trying to get off a shot. 

With 2:30 remaining in !he quar-
ter, UCSD broke dvough. The Tri-
tons managed to pop the ball inside 
10 Iason "Turtle" Brown, who 
quickly flicked a backhand shol past 
Bruin goalie Dan Hackett to knot 
the score at I-I. 

UCSD also played good defense 
and managed to collapse inside and 
takeaway Ua.A' s tWQ-OlCfergame. 
Good teams find a way to win 
though, as the Bruins gunned in two 
more outside shots to take a 3,-1 lead 
at the end of the period. 

UCLA has traditionally had an 
extremely fast team. lbe Tritons 
did an excellent job tIuoughout the 
game of shutting down the Bruin 
counterattack. UCLAmanagedjust 
one fast break goal early in the sec-
ond period as it capitalized on a 
Triton tumover. 

"[UCLA] is super fast," said 
UCSD Head Coach Denny Harper. 
"One thing we did do this game was 
shut down the counterattack. That's 
how we've lostlo them before. This 
time we just tried to get down the 
pool." 

As both teamS warmed up in the 
second period, the game began to 
get rough. Each drew several six-
on-five situations but neither could 
convert. Twiee-in the period, the 
Tritons managed to draw ejections 
on two Bruin players and gain six-
on-four situations. 

The Tritons controlled the UCLA 
transition game well all game and 
trailed by only a goal, 5-4, at the 
half. 

As has become a panem in re-
cent weeks, however, UCSD lost its 
level ofintensity in the third quarter. 
After Kevin Vance managed to re-
direct a Greg Goodrich pass into the 
upper left haod comer of the Bruins' 
cage to tie the score at 5-5, UCLA 
went on a tear. 

UCSD watched its chances to 
pull even dwindle as Ua.A burned 
up the scoreboard with five goals in 
six minutes to take a 10-5 lead. 'The 
Bruins continued to unload from 
outside and clamped down even 
harder on defense, 

"Ua..A has ttemen<Ious shoot-
ers," Harper said. ". think they have 
one of the best front~1IIt teams in 
the nation." 

A possible turning point in the 
game came in the thirdquarter when 
UCSD had a man-up opportunity. 
With UQ.A up by dvee and two 
and a halfminutes left in the period, 
Harpercalled a timeout to set up the 
Tritons' offense. 

According to Harper, he was 
hoping that, ifUCSDcould move to 
within two, it could mae a move in 
!hefounhquaner. But Ua.Apicked 
oft' a Mike Nalu pus and converted 
it into a goal to put the Tritms down 
by four. 

UCSD was continually forced ~ 
shoot from !he outside - a task 
made all the more difticult when 
HIckea. one of the NCAA's pre-
mier plies, is in the cqe,

• Men's cross country 
finishes third, women 
place fifth at CCAA 
championships 
By Peter Ko 
Sports Editor 

At the California Collegiate Ath-
letic Association championships in 
Riverside Saturday. the UCSD 
men' cross country team placed 
third with 99 points, 69 behind the 
winner, UC Riverside. The UCSD 
women's cross country team. in a 
slight disappointment, placed fifth 
overall , 92 points back of Cal Poly 
Pomona. the No. I team in Division 
UandwinneroftheNCAA champi-
onship the last nine years running. 

The Triton men had entered the 
meet expecting to place third, with 
an outside shot at second, according 
10 Head Coach Mark Stanforth. The 
favorites coming into the meet were 
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo (No.8 in 
Division ll) and UCR (No. 18 in 
Division U). Stanforth had expressed 
hope that the Tritons could finish 
ahead of U':';J.i, his optimism based 
on the HigNllJXIers' lack of depth. 

But VCR received a one-two 
finishfromSimonVroeman(25:02) 
and Sharon Winkelman (25:03) -
in addition 10 IwO other top IO fin-
ishes - aNi not only held off the 
Tritons, bll1passed CPSLO as well 
to claim the conference champion-
ship. 

CPSLO notched three of the top 
six spots - led by Matt Hempel's 
third place finish in a time of25: 19 
- to finish second. 

Five UCSD runners ,t;nished 
within six spots of each other to 
wmp up third. Sam Gwynn led 
UCSD with a 17th place finish. one 
minute and 18 seconds behind 
Vroeman. He was followed-in the 
Triton scoring group by Man Ringer 
(19Ih. 26:29). Steve Fensler (21st. 
26:35). Fussum Keflezighi (22nd, 
26:42) and Steve Stuart (23rd. 
26:44).

is Kalamazoo, a Michigan school 
that somehow was designated for 
the West Region. 

McManus confessed to not even 
knowing "where Kalamazoo was 
until IO minutes ago." And if 
McManus didn' t even know where 
the school was located, you can 
imagine how much he knows about 
its soccer team. Right - noching. 

The Trit.ons are slightly more 
famiJiarwith St Mary's. According 
to McManus, the Cardinals are a 
perennial visitor to the West 
Regionals: "They've been in the Far 

W~ final four every year I've been 
here - the last five or six years. 

"They're a strong team, always 
aggressive," he said. 

McManus said that he didn't 
know much more about the Cardi-
nals and really didn't plan to leaml 
too much more. "I'm more worried 
about how we play," he said. "If we 
do everything right. then that's all 
we can do." 

Of the four teams ·in the West 
Regional, the Tritons are most fa-
miliar with Cal Luthctan. UCSD 
beat the Regals I-D earlier this year 
on a penalty- kick with JO minutes 
remaining in the contest. "They're a 
good tearn and geuing better all the 
time," McManus said "I picked 
them to be in the (regionals] at the 
beginning of the year.

"They 're young, have great ath-
letes, four or five good players and 
a lot of speed," he added. 

On the national picture, the Tri-
tons appear to have caught a break 
in that the two teams ranked ahead 
of them - William Smith and Ply-
mouthState- wouldn'tplayUCSD 
until the national championship 
game. should any of them make it 
that far. But McManus said that it 
really doesn't matter to him when 
they play: "Not really. You have to 
play the good teams sooner or later. 
There are no second chances in this 
tournament, so it really doesn't 
matter." 

Aside from William Smith and 
Plymouth Stale, McManus noted 
that Ithaca - a powerhouse ~ 
gram that always seems to be in the 
final four - and Cortland Stale 
could be factors in the tournament 
McManus was panicularly im-
pressed with Cortland State: 
"Cortland '5 a good tearn. I've heard 
a lot of good Ihings about them. 
They've had a lot of injuries, but 
now they ' re fit and healthy. They' re 
an exceptionally fast team. 

"They might be a darkhorse." 
Cortland State's biggest prob-

lem might be .that it is in the same 
bracket as No.2 Plymouth State. 

One tearn that appears to be out 
of place in the l6-team field is Ohio 
Wesleyan, which wasn't ranked in 
the top 20 when the most recent 
polJs came out. McManus specu-

opportunity to some other schools 
besides tho5e in Minnesota and New 
Yolt, which traditionally send·the 
most schools to the tournament 

In any event, the Tritons have to 
concem themselves with their own 
region first. McManus attributed 
some of the blame for their loss to 
CSU Dominguez Hills on Saturday 
to fatigue, SO he intends to take it 
easy before regiona1s. 

"We won't have any t.eavy prac-
tice this week. We'll relax, take 
things easy and get our legs rested," 
he said "If we've got our attitude 
right, we're as good as any team out 
there."

Even with a full learn it would 
have been a struggle for UCS D. The 
Toroscame into the game needing a 
win 10 keep theirplayoffhopes aJive. 
"They just wanted it more than we 
did. They went forevery ball and we 
just sat back-and watched," UCSD 
Head Coach Brian McManus said. 

The Toros' first goal carne at 
16:32 in the first half on a long 
throw-in by Jenny Womack. Stac:i 
Blough took the pltiSand headed the 
ball past goalie Ienelle Welling. 

CSUDH's second goal came 
three minutes before halftime. Jen-
niferGrasso lobbed a comer kick to 
Anna Rubin who headed it in for the 
second and final goal of the game. 

The Toms kept Wdling busy, 
taking 16 shots on goal. Welling, 
who at one point this year had made 
a grand total of thrt't saves, made 14 
saves on Saturday alone. "We were 
dominated, just completely out-
played. It was a physical game and 
we just stood back and let ourselves 
get pushcd around," McManus said 

The lackluster performance 
sparked concern on the part of 
McManus, with the West Regionals 
right 8fOWId the comer. "TIlere' s no 
way we'll do anything in regionals 
with the way the attitude is right 
now," he said. '~re's no way you 
can put heart into them. The players 
just have to want it."

Sticking Pins in 
Mike Tyson's Head 
I DON'T KNOW HOW, Blffl'MSURE Johnny Cash is involved with this somehow. Here's what [ 
know: 

Our story begin at Miami 
airport, us an odd-looking lillIe 
man carries a silver auachc5 case 
off hi flight from Port au Prince, 
Haiti . The man hands the brief-
case to a man wearing thick 
glasses. 

"It's for the man." he say . 
"TIle man in black." 

Several days later, the world 
discovers that heavyweight champ 
Mike Tyson is going to marry TV 
star Robin Givens. Nobody 
connects the two events. 

Nobody ties in the arrival of 
the same man on the same flight 
from Port au Prince two days 
before Givens divorce Tyson. 
Nobody says a word when the 
man steps off a flight in Tokyo the 
day before the Tyson-Buster 
Douglas f1ght. And no one saw 
him in O'Hare airport the day 
before the Miss Black America 
pageant in Chicago. 

N OBODY WOULD have ever known, were it not for the 
slip-up while Tyson wus training 
for his fight with Evander 
Holyfield. You see, our odd-
looking little man switched planes 
in Miami and headed for'fYson's 
training center. But w/len I1e 
arrived in Tysonville. the man 
with the glasses wasn't t!)ere. 
Instead, there was a limosine 
driver waiting for him. 1'lle man 
and his briefcase were whisked 
away to a nearby hotel. 

In a penthouse room atop the 
beautiful Tysonville Hilton, he 
was greeted by someone he had 
never expected to meet. The man 
was a horrific sight, with insane 
eyes and a huge tuft of white hair. 
And next to the crazy man was the 
champ himself .. . Holyfield. 
Holyfield had a shocked look on 
hi face. 

"V au SEE, Evander, we've 
found your Haitian 

connection," Don King told him. 
"We know what you 've been 
doing. And we won't report it to 
the police . . . if you give us control 
of the doll." 

"What would you want with 
it?" Holyfield asked. "It can't be 
of any use to you!" 

"You'd be surprised about 
what we can do," King said. He 
snapped his fingers, and two thugs 
ushered the mighty champ out of 
the room 

Then King opened the attachc5 
case. Inside was a doll, about four 
inches high. It looked remarkably 
like Tyson, right down to the 
kiner's eyes and dull expression. 
Next to it in the case were a small 
\ock of Tyson's hair and a straight 
pin. 

"Now," King said, laughing in-
sanely, "we make some r~1 mon-

• Women's volleyball comes 
from behind to down Westmont 
By Chris R ...... 
Associate Sports Editor 

For the better part of this season, the story 
for the UCSD women's volleyball team has 
been the Tritons dominating their opponents. 
But that wasn't the case Satwday night at the 
Main Gym. After wiping out WeslmOnt in 
the first game, UCSD (22-5, No. I in Divi-
sion llI) had to corne from behind to take the 
next two games and the march. 

Before the match started, the Tritons h0n-
ored seniors Stacie Sasaki, Dana Simone, 
Villi Van Duyne and FJizabeth Tan in their 
last regular season home game. Perhaps car-
rying some of the emotion from the cer-
emony into the match, the Tritons gave every

Confirming what everyone

whether or not UCSD would 
host: "Not really. Especially 
since three weeks ago when Cal 
Lutheran came out [in the West 
Region polls] at number three." 

UCSD, whether it needed the 
help or not, was also aided by 
the fact that Cal Lutheran never 
put in a bid to host. Still, 
McManus noted, you can never 
be too sure when the NCAA is 
running thinp. A case in point

Keeping it Going 
The women's rights movement gains momentum on campus 

HISTORICAL ESSAY BY KARA SAUL, CONTRIBUTING WRITER 

Late last month, the Convnittce 
on Educational Policy fmally 
approved a proposal thai many 
students have struggled for four 
years to see. Pending finaJ 
approval by the Budget Commit-
tee, UCSD will at last have a 
Women's Studies major. 

Ironically, the controversy 
sunounding this issue was 
resolved only four days befo~ 
men and women from all of the 
UC campuses united here to 
discuss "The Clanging Faces of 
Feminism" III the second annual 
Women's Conference. It may 
seem odd to hold a conference on 
women at UCSD, the only 
University of California campus 
that does not have a complete 
women's center with a profes-
sional staff. 

UCSD's budget for its 
Women's Resource Center is a 

me~ $1 ,500. The next lowest 
budget fora women's 

do with wanting to retain the 
political roots of women's studies. 
It bridges the academy and the 
conununity - people interested 
in 5tUdying gender were aca-
demic, but also activists in the 
conununity. [This major) evokes 
that dual role." 

Molly McKay, a Revelle 
College senior and member of the 
Women's Resource Center, 
knows the history of abuse and 
hard work the women's move-
ment ~ encountered. 

"TIus campus is not friendly to 
women," she says. Through her 
own efforts and the efforts of the 
other pacesetters on campus, the 
women's movement continues to 
press the administration to open 
its eyes to its female students. 

McKay describes feminism as 
coming in two waves. TIle first 
was a racist battle ignited by the 
abolitionist movement. Former 

on Saturday. Issues ranged from 
Black Feminism, Sexual Harass-
ment. Lesbianism In Feminism, 
and Domesdc Violence, to Value 
Oarification, Affinnative Action. 
Women in Science Imd The 
(boice of Motherhood. 

The conference acknowledged 
that feminism is not a label but a 
broad spectrum of views. From 
liberal to radical to undecided, 
many voices were taJking and 
laughing while others were 
listening and learning. 

I \eft the conference distuJbed 
by what 1 had learned. I am now 
beginning to realize that perbaps it 
is not possible for women to do 
anything and everything they want 
to with their lives, minds and 
bodies. TIle world we live in may 
build barriers too big for them to 
climb alone. 

I left with numerous unan-
swered questions. How do we 

change society to a 
center on any UC 
campus is $78,000. 
These figures should be 
an embarrassment to the 
administration. 

Perhaps it is not possible for women to do 
anything and everything they want with their 

lives, minds and bodies. The world 

more accepting point 
of view? Can a 
woman be both wife 
and mother while 
excelling as a profes-
sional? Why have so 
many desperate issues 

Despite the apparent 
lack of administrative 
suppon. and with credit 

we live in may build barriers too big for 
them to climb alone. not been addressed by 

our government and 
our university? 

going to multiple 
student governing 
boards, men and women united 
here Oct. 25-21 to respect, seek 
and promote: "Diversity, com-
monality and dialogue." 

Fifty percent of the world's 
population - women of all races, 
~Iigions and classes - ~ been 
stTUggling against the tide of 
systemic discrimination. This 
conference discussed how the 
current can be made to change 
direction. 

Maybe then 90 percent of 
working women wiu not occupy 
only the bottom five percent of 
jobs. Maybe then women will not 
make 68 cents on a man's dollar. 
Maybe then women will not be 
exploited by the media and the 
system will no longer see them as 
objects but as subjects. 

"I'm very pleased that UCSD 
seems to be becom-
ing mo~ hospitable 
to feminist thought 
and women's study," 
commented the 
director of the new 
UCSD Women's 
Studies program. 
UteranI1'e Professor 
Stephanie Jed. "That 
was not true in the 
pat. UCSD is the 
last UC campus 10 
ippI'OYe a Women's 
Studies major." 

Why is the new 
major titled 
"Women's Studies" 
and not "Gender 
Studies?" Responds 
Dr. Jed, "I beUeve 
the decision had to 

African slaves were seeking equal 
status under the law. White 
women such as Susan B. Anthony 

we~ appalled that a vole would 
be given to men of color befo~ 
white women. Side by side, the 
two movements progressed. 
Separately, they fought against the 
same backwards system. 

Later, the movements met 
again. During the Civil Rights 
movement of the 1960's, the 
women's rights movement started 
its second wave. Picking up on the 
momentum of the African-
American movement, the 
women's rights movement owes a 
lot to their efforts. Yet there are 
still unchaned waters left for both 
to embrace, perhaps together. 

The Women's Conference 
included thm: sets of wolbhops 

The building of a women's 
center is an ideal place to begin to 
answer these questions. The fight 
for this center is ten years old. TIle 
chief obstruction is locating the 
funds for the project. 

"I'm hopeful that the adminis-
tration will follow this tmld [in 
suppon of Women's Studies] with 
the funding of the Women's 
Resource Center Imd of women's 
specialists," Jed comments. 

In the opening ceremony of the 
conference, organizer Headier 
Martel said, "Feminism is I! 
movement working for, with and 
within justice and truth." 

The Women's Conference 
exposed the problems. Now it is 
up to all of us to respond with an 
enIighlened mind and a new 
vision.

Working it Out 
Conference workshops open the forum for 

discussion of not just women's issues 
BY ALICIA BELl CONTRIBUTING WRITER 

In order 10 better understand what the UCSA' s 
Women's Conference was all ~t, I attended three 
worksbops over the course of the weekend. I admit to 
having gone in with a somewhat skeptical attitude, 
questioning whether 'feminism' and 'women's 
studies' deserved to be treaIed as fields separate from 
the more mainstream 'liberal' educational experience. 

The three workshops all dealt with current, high-
profile topics. The first, Men as Feminists, considered 
the role of men in modem feminism. Sexual Harass-
ment in the University Atmosphere was concerned 
with how sexual harassment is m:ognized and dealt 
with in a collegiate setting. In Exploring the Genera-
tion Gap and th~ Myth of Powerlessness, we dis-
cussed how people of advanced years can still be 
relevant and powerful in our youth-oriented society. 
• Men and Femiaism 

This workshop focused on how sexism affects 
men, as well as the male role in fighting sexism. Jim 
Cua, a gay man supportive of women's rights, led the 
discussion. "Homosexuals and women share a 
common enemy in their battle for rights: the funda-
mentalist church," Cua said. 

He also explained that the large role women play 
in social work and in health care, and panicularly 
their work on the AIDS issue, has led him to recipro-
cate their help by being active in various women's 
groups such as the National Organization for 

Women. Cua addressed specific questions to a 
group of men and women. 

To the question "How does sexism hun men?" 
many men in the group responded that they are 
often stereotyped as being anti-women. One 
Chicano male added that he often receives lhe label 
of macho because of his background. But men also 
benefit from sexism; they have a greater amount of 
power financially, politically and sexually. 

"Men are deprived of healthy emotional relation-
ships when they can't express themselves fully," 
claimed Tyler, a junior at UC Irvine. He continued, 
"We will all accomplish more and have more power 
over ourselves if we are given the same opportuni-
ties." Why should men want to give women some of 
this power? 

How can we help raise men's level of conscious-
ness on sexism? Change our language was one 
sl,lggestion, as language reflects our thoughts and 
prejudices. Men need to know that they can express 
emotions. Women need to correct men when they 
are being sexist in their speech, they need to raise 
their children in a sexism-free environment and they 
must continue to challenge men in sports and in Lhe 
workplace. 

Cua concluded by saying thal everyone mu t 
vOle and become politically involved if they wish to

Organizers discuss how the conference came to be, 
and how they came to be there 

BY JUSTIN KATZ , CONTRIBUTING WRITER 

C ounlless hours of work culminated in last weekend's second annual University of California Student Association (UCSA) Women's 
Conference. This was a massive project for 
an underfunded and relatively new 
women's program to take on, but persever-
ance brought it together for over thirty 
workshops and guest speakers such as poet 
Adrienne Rich and Chicana activist Gloria 
Anzaldua. 

"TIle Changing Faces of Feminism" 
began last spring, when a dedicated group 
of women formed a women's coalition to 
improve the situation of women 's rights 
here at UCSD. This coalition of tudent , 
gmduates. staff and faculty worked together 
to gener,lIe support for women's rights and 
femini -m. They also set out to destroy the 
old stereotype of feminists being militant 
and men-hating and to educate people to II 
more humanistic way of looking at the 
world. 

" People should not be ashamed to say, 
'I'm a femini t, '" explained Consuela SCO", 
one of the conference coordinators. 
"Femini -m i a way of thinking and looking 
at the world. Feminism is seeing the world 
through a woman' eyes, and seeing the 
inequalities that affect both men and 
women. Feminism is looking at our social 
system and realizing that it puts us all at a 
disadvantage. 

"Thi . is an illc/llsil'l! conference. That ' s 
why it 's called 'The Changing Faces of 
Feminism.' We want men to be a part of the 
process. Men are cla~sified and discrimi-
nated against as well. Men aren't allowed to 
enjoy com pas ion with their children. 
Fathers aI'e disc iplinnrian . They can' t 
enjoy cooking except for the ' family 
barbecue.' We wan[ men to come to this 
conference with their feelings and ideas. 
Men often feel 0 allacked by feminist ideas 
that they can't keep an open mind. Their 
first reaction is to be defensive. and as soon 
as they feel vulnemble the walls go up." 

UCSA Campus Office Director Heather 
Gold felt that people are closed minded 
regarding feminism: "Some people think 
we're all militanl, and if you ' re a feminist 
then you're obviously some big hairy he-
woman. But through events like this 
conference, people will come away with a 
real sense of self and understanding." 

No[ that the conference came here 

easily. Women's Resource Center member 
and University Center Board Ouair Molly 
McKay told of the frustnuing 
work lhal went into sponsoring 
this conference. "For ten years 
we've been trying for a woman's 
center, and we were sick of 
receiving no support. so during 
Spring Quaner of last year we 
fonned the Women's Coalition. 
For the first time students and 
faculty worked together. This 
really made us sit back and say, 
'Wow! We can really do some-
thing! '" 

Last year. while McKay was 
Associated Students Vice Presi-
dent of External Affairs, she found 
out about the Second Annual 
Women's Conference. "All of a 
udden we thought, ' Let's have it 

here!' We had all these great 
ideas, bul when we put in our bid 
it was almost like, 'What could 
you possibly have to offer?' 
UCSD has been notorious for 
ignoring women's issue . We were 
told straight out, 'There is no way 
you can do thi . n, 

"UC Davis also put in a really 
good bid," explained Gold. the 
main liaison between UCSD and 
the other UC campuses. "Whereas 
we've been struggling for 
recognition, Davis would've been 
celebrming the twentieth anniver-
sary of their Women's Center. So 
we got the bid, and by doing so, 
made an important political 
statement. ,. 

"People really didn't expect 
much of this conference, but 
we've done it," McKay contin-
ued. "Blood, sweat, and tears 
were all we had in the Spring 
Quarter, and that's what we had to 
use for this." 

SCOII agreed that it was tough 
at times. "While selling up the 
conference it was extremely 
challenging to incorporate 
everyone's differences. The 
biggest realizalion was that 
although we have come together 
for a common cause, we are in no 
way the same people. Everyone

has validity to them. To deny that validity is 
wrong. The hardest thing is not to say the 
' but' word: 'Oh. I totally understand you, 
but . . . ' When you say that it removes any 
significance from what was just said. 

"At times I felt very removed from the 
process. It was hard to have to explain 
myself and share my experiences as a 
woman of color. I think many of the 

Caucasian women felt accused or 
threatened, at least in the begin-
ning. But I wasn't trying to say 
who wa~ right or wrong - just the 
facts. When someone is feeling 
accused it's difficult for them to 
say, 'Okay, you 're right. You're 
I'atid ... • 

Lack of publicity was a major 
problem for the organizers. 
Although the conference received 
more than four hundred sign-ups. 
many students on campus didn't 
even know about it. 

"We were on a really tight 
budget," said Gold. ''The main-
stream publicity wasn ·tthere. Our 
base funding comes from A.S. 
money and that just wouldn't 
cover expenses." 

Despite the troubles a.~iated 
with image and finance. the 
organizers were very optimistic. 
Each woman had a personal goal 
for the conference. 

" I want people not just to hear 
the voices but to try and under-
stand them," said Scott. "I want 
people to be able to talk after-
wards. not just debate and fight. I 
want everyone to realize that 
rssues offeminism. or womanism. 
affect all of us. We don't under-
stand each other •• \Od until we try. 
nothing is going to change. 

"1 wasn' t bom with u handbook 
on what it's like to be a woman of 
color in our society. You have to 
leam for yourself. The hardest pan 
is to remove yourself from your 
own life's experience enough to 
appreciate others." 

"People need to understand that 
a different point of view is still 
okay," McKay said. "Students, 
and only students, are the force 
and vision of this conference 
against all odds. There is only an 
illl/sion of being powerless. You 
know the line - if there's a will 
there 's a way." 

Each organizer's entry into 
feminism differed. SCOIt said, " I 
have always noticed differences in 

CItAIIIOUa • CLU8 0 COURTYARD 

people, and the disadvantages of being 
certain ways. Butl first openly called 
myself a feminist about two years ago. 
during my freshman year. I felt like I 
walked through a door to an entirely 
different viewpoint. It was like my sun-
glasses were completely lifted off. 

" It 's very powelful and empowering to 
be comfortable with calling yourself a 
feminist. It's a wonderful feeling to be 
linked up to a supponive group, to find 
people that think the same way. You begin 
to think, 'Hey, l'm not wrong. alone. or 
cr..LlY.' And that's imponant. Be true to 
yourself." 

Gold got involved by taking on the 
pmctic .. ltasks orthe Conference and the 
busywork behind it. "I was appointed last 
spring as the A.S. Lobby Annex director, 
and part of that job was being the UCSA 
campus director. I was responsible for 
bringing state issues to campuses. So when 
the topic of the Women's Conference came 
up. I was more than ready to bring it to 
UCSD." 

McKay said it stalled with the way she 
was mised. "My mom and dad are both 
feminists, and their v.dues and ethics WCI'e 
very supponive of the things I'm working 
for to this day. In school I was the biggest 
geek ever. I didn ' t have many fri ends. and 
that left me a lUI of time to read. 

"In the ninth gmde I moved to San 
Diego. and I didn' tlike how people, 
especially young women, were being 
treated. My science teacher told me that 
girls are no good at math or science. and 
that really upset me - I've always been a 
fi ghter and debater. 

"My junior year here I got pregnant and 
had to have an abortion. A woman cannot 
get .. safe. legal abortion in our country. I 
almost died from it; I was just lucky enough 
to have the money to save myself. Many 
women that need the care can't pay for it. 
Seeing this made me all the more ~erious 
about women's issues. _, 

"The problem is that we as women have 
no voice in govemment. The only choice is 
gmssroots movements - to keep one foot 
within the structure and one without. If you 
become mdical it allows you to become 
marginalized. I shaved my head on the 
cease-fire day of the Gulf War, which wa~ 
also International Women's Day. I was 
making an anti-war and a Women 's Rights 
statement at [he same time. It was bizarre. 
and it challenged my notion of femininity. 
I've always been able to 'fit in: and it was 
symbolic to shave my head am! ~ay ' I 'm 
serious!' It was my image, my body. and 
my mind - I was entirely dedicated to 
wh .. t I believe in."

Sexual 

harassment is 
any behavior 
that creates an intimidating or 
hostile environment. 1bese 
behaviors may include someone 
telling you about their sex life, 
asking you about yours, touching 
you, making sexual gestures or 
making sexual remarks. 

Victims react by dressing to 
hide themselves, dropping out of 
school, feeling guilt and exhibit-
ing physical symptoms. 

Reasons why sexual harass-
ment might occur are numerous. 
Some men may I'lOI know how to

as sex objects. Some professors

performance hould be kept so that 
the professor does not lower any 
grades as a result of a lack of 
response to his or her sexual 
advances. 

Many women shared their 
experiences of sexual harassment 
and how they dealt with it. One 
woman responded to sexual 
advances by saying to her boss, 
"Would you be doing this if your 
wife were here?"

benefits of panicipation. These
