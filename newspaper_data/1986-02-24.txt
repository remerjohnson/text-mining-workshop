Administrative Viet President Ariel A.nguiano will submit his resignation today. 

Over alternative media 
AS vice president to resign 
By PHIL W1LLON, Editor in Chief 

I NA MOVE THAT TOOK the AS Council by surprise, Administrative Vice President 
Ariel Anguiano announced his 
resignation because of what he 
called the council's blatant 
disregard for "alternative views." 

His decision was prompted 
after the council did not approve 
his appOintment to the newly 
formed AS Subcommittee on 
Alternative Media Funding at 
their meeting last Wednesday, 
and instead voted in a friend of 
another councilmember. The 
committee was formed in January 
to study possible funding 
methods for the nine alternative 
media on campus and to draw 
up a referendum for students to 
vote on the issue this spring. 

"It's a matter of principle, they 
don't want to give an alternative 
view," Anguiano said last 
Thursday. "The student 
representatives are not 
representing students." 

It is the administrative vice 
president'S responsibility to 
appoint all "student at large" 
representatives [0 th~ various AS 
comminees. This was only the 
second appointment Anguiano

made during his term that was 
not passed by the council , the 
other being his recommendation 
for the committee to appoint a 
Revelle Provost. 

The subcommittee on 
alternative media funding was 
formed after the AS had passed a 
controversial proposal that 
limited aU the media to a 
maximum $4,000 a year in 
student funding, drawn up by 
Commissioner of 
Communications Michael 
Fahlbusch. The measure met 
with strong resistance, forcing 
the AS to create a board of 
students to study possible 
alternatives. 

At first the committee was to 
have two representatives from 
the alternative media, two 
representatives from the Media 
Board, two studetns at large and 
a chairperson. But the cO\.lnci! 
changed its structure under the 
direction of AS President Mary 
Rose Alexander, to eliminate the 
alternative media positions and 
one Media Board member and to 
replace them with AS 
Councilmembers. 

Alexander said it would be a

conflict of interest to have a 
representative from the 
alternative media drawing up 
recommendations for their own 
funding. 

"It would give them an obvious 
bias," she said Sunday. "' think 
this whole issue has been blown 
out of proportion." 

"The council felt that keeping 
on who was going to the 
meetings would be more 
beneficial." 

"It went from a really 
representative committee to an 
AS Committee," Anguiano said . 
"We officially ignored someone 
this time, how many times was it 
unofficial?" 

According to Lilys McCoy, 
chair of the media funding 
committee and current student 
advocate, Alexander's changes 
hampered the credibility of the 
board but not its effectiveness. 

"The committee is advisory 
only," she said. "Even with an 
alternative media representative 
there, there is not much that we 
can do that is earthshaking." 

Because it is under the guise 
of the council, the subcommittee

The AS "extended family" loses control 
It is not an uncommon phenomenon in 

the everyday life of a journal to receive 
housecalls from individuals who feel that 
their present situation is worth a line or two 
in the next day's paper. Many of these 
protagonists seek to defame an institution, or 
to derail the ambitions of another individual, 
or to expose an alleged crime. Some, 
however, wish to clear their consciences of 
actions that they have knowingly participated 
in, but that had eventually been taken over by 
a sense of ethics. So when Ariel Anguiano Jr. 
walked into our office Thursday, and told us 
that he would resign from his post as AS Vice 
President of Administrative Affairs as a result 
of his frustration with the "hypOCritical" 
political process of the Associated Students 
Council, we debated the personal and ethic;;ll 
justification of his claims. 

Ariel won his Vice-preSidential position 
almost a year ago in the kind of election that 
a politicO has nightmares about; that is, he 
ran a very lonely campaign, as no one 
opposed his candidacy. In fact , the slate that 
he ran with (RSVP) was Virtually not opposed 
at all, except by some very minor candidates; 
voter turnout was also extremely 
disappointing, considering the unusual 
amount of political activity that was occurring 
around the issue of UC investment in South 
Africa. The RSVP slate, then, did not exactly 
have a mandate to govern as they pleased 
without public consent. That is how they 
perceived it, though, as some incumbents will 
when faced with a severe lack of interest, or 
faith , in the effectiveness of student 
government. 

Vice President Anguiano resigned from his 
position in a show of protest - one that is 
Signified by his claim that his voice, 
seemingly an alternative one to the nominally 
redundant perspectives that are expressed by 
the majority of the council - was 
conSistently stifled by impervious 
councilmembers. Ariel stated numerous times 

that he was convinced before taking office 
that he could effect change by virtue of his 
position. That belief was proven wrong time 
and time again as any "alternative" piece of 
legislation that passed through council hands 
was either amended or knocked down or, in 
more realistic terms, not even proposed. 
However, while Ariel's resignation is a clear 
indication of the breakdown of democratic 
process within the council's "extended family" 
(Ariel's term, not ours), it does not vindicate 
Mr. Anguiano of his panicipation in past AS 
follies. He may have become wholly 
disillusioned with the council's treatment of 
the alternative media, and their dismissal of 
popular student demand as "mere 
recommednations," bur his presence did 
more to hurt the prospects and n.eeds of 
those alternative voices than it ever did to 
help them. For when a person . of color who 
supposedly holds some progressive views sits 
on a council that, for example , refused to 
decisively act on a blatant abuse of student 
free speech rights except for holding a 
hearing, (we are speking of the incident this 
fall where the police selectively tore up anti-
apartheid flyers on the Revelle walkway), he 
not only loses some credibility within his 
own community, but also lends credibility to 
the decisions made by the council. This, of 

course, was his fatal mistake - Ariel became 
a tool for the majority. 

Ariel's resignation came none too soon for 
the alternative media, who may greatly benefit 
from the exposure that this issue will give to 
their plight. His allegation that 
councilmembers do not truly listen to other 
students' viewpoints during meetings is not 
exactly an astounding revelation, but it is a 
sound piece of advice for those students who 
believe that the existence of an "open input" 
session at the beginping of an AS meeting is 
anything other than a trivial memoranda. 
Have we gained any valuable advice this time 
around? Did we really ever believe that the AS 
Council could be tumed into a force for 
change on this campus? 

Yes, the council as an institution can have 
a positive and forceful effect on the 
uiniversity. This year's representatives have 
not proved to be anymore than a catatonic 
group of wishful thinkers, but that can 
change. If we do hope, as Ariel did , that 
alternative, ethical voices should be heard at 
the very least within student government, then 
we should regroup and create and AS Council 
that works for all of the students. If we do 
not, the voices for change will continue to be 
ignored and stifled.

Editor: 
In response to the opinion 

article "The tiring tradition of the 
Greek system," we were appalled 
at the lack of research and 
unfounded generalizations 
presented by the unknown 
author. 

We have yet to see how the 
Greeks faU under the category of 
"paid for frie nds" when fees , 
broken down weekly , range from 
$5 ro $10 a week. Is there a 
college student today that spends 
less than $5 a week on their own 
entertainment? Highly unlikely, 
cons idering the cost is a little 
more than buying a candy bar 
daily. 

It is a shame how 
organizations today are held 
responsible for past events; and 
regardless of what is done to 
change the image , the 
prejudgement still remains . 
When writing this , we refer to 
hazing True, there have been 
dlstastful hazing practices m the 
past, but to claim that fraternity 
brothers "do not even respect the 
physical or emotional integrity of 
their own fratrernity brothers" is 
outrageous. This is a rotal 
contradiction to the Greek 

system in general. The whole 
idea is to promote sisterhood 
and brotherhood, so what would 
be the point to demean one 
another? Besides, any person 
that has no respect for the 
physical and emotional well 
being of another lacks respect for 
themselves first. 

The author of the anicle has 
obviously failed in researching 
the standards that sororities 
uphold. The difference between 
sororities and other clubs is that 
we maintain an academic 
standard. If people consider 
upholding academic excellence 
ro be "elitist," we pity their 
ignorance. Are we to understand 
then that the author considers 
members of various athletic 
groups to be part of an "elitist 
society," since they also require a 
certain academic level? Once 
again , highly unlikely. Or to the 
comment that those who wear 
similar sweatshirts are "identity-
less: implies that students have 
a UCSD sweatshirt, a baseball 
sweatshirt, a tennis sweatshirt, 
etc ., lack individuality. We find 
this hard to believe. 

The remark that soronties 
have never "educated women 
about nor prOVided them access 
to sources of physical or 
mtellectual power" IS of complete 

stupidity. Julia Ward Howe 
(author of the Battle of the 
Republic), Mary Stallins Coleman 
(Michigan Supreme Court 
justice), Ruth Byran Rohde (first 
female ambassador to Denmark) 
Louisa Hoover. Joan Lunden, 
Margaret Chase Smith (former 
senator from Maine) are just 
some examples of the many 
women that are members of 
sororities. 

There are 800 people involved 
in the Greek system, If our 
policies, our attitudes and our 
requirements for membership are 
so biased, how does one pOSSibly 
explain such a large affiliation? 
The Greeks at UCSD strive to 
achieve their best. If people 
cannot recognize this through 
the accomplishments that we all 
have made, what greater crime 
could there be?

When I turned to your 
editorial about the Greek system, 
I had hoped to find something 
other that the by now typical , 
uninformed opinions about 
Greeks that are a result of 
repeated vicwmgs of "Animal 

House" and other. such cinematic 
masterpieces. It ~as clear from 
the title of the piece. however, 
that I could expect nothing more 
than a biased, cheap shot at 
fraternities from the Guardian. ! 
was not disappointed. 

Apparently, the Guardian's 
editorial staff never paused to 
consider the fact the the 
"dominance over social and 
political establishments that the 
Greeks are purported to cany out 
on many campuses stems not 
from any conspiracy, but from 
honest motivation. The same 
people who are motivated 
enough to form a fraternity and 
learn to give themselves for their 
brothers, just happen ro be the 
kmds of people who are the 
most strongly driven to become 
campus leaders. Surprise , 
surprise. 

"Prejudice" and "hazing" are 
twO stigmas that will be forever 
attached to the fraternity system 
because, in fact. such flaws did 
mark the system in the past. 
However. things have cllanges 
dramatically. Speaking as a 
member of Sigma Alpha Mll 
(NOT "Sigma Kappa MU ,I» as was 
erroneously reported in the 
Guardian), let me say that our 
fratemlty has had an open door 
si nce 1953 for all collegiate males 

- period. There is no stronger 
possible "inclusive policy." Our 
current membership is one of 
the most ethnically diverse 
groups on this campus. Our 
fraternity'S position on hazing is, 
and has always been, that any 
chapter caught hazing will face 
an immediate charter suspension 
and possible revocation. It is a 
pity that the Guardian editors 
responsible for characterizing 
UCSD's Greeks as a cruel, 
clannish minority did (sic) 
attempt to researc h the facts 
before making such inflammatory 
statements about the nature of 
fratemal life . 

To characterize Greeks as 
proponents of "economically 
based snobbery" is unfair and 
erroneous. Running an 
organization, any organization, 
that bri ngs people together to 
enjoy many, varied social and 
philanthropic activities costs 
money. In the case of collegiate 
social fratemities , the problem of 
money is particularly acute 
because of the wide scope of 
actiVities pursued by a typical 
chapter. Chapters are suppossed 
to be self-financed , so members 
are charged dues and non-
members are nOt invited to many 
activities. It is only proper that 

Plea!'e tum to page 5

those who pay for activities 
should determine which 
'activities are open and which are 
not , and the choice should be 
rightfully recognized as theirs to 
make by others in the university 
community. I would not consider 
it my right to attend a concert 
here on campus without paying 
simply because I am a student at 
UCSD, and similarly, I feel that it 
is unfair to criticize the closed 
nature of many Greek activities 
simply because non-paying, non-
members are not always 
welcome. 

I will close this letter with the 
words of President Ronald 
Reagan, who wrote, "The 
fraternity builds its prestige by 
encouraging each individual 
member to become an 
uncommon man. ThOse who 
place their faith in regimentation 
and mass movements decry this , 
but theirs is now the way to 
freedom." In the future, dilTicult 
as it may be, please try to 
research the facts and control 
the editorial staffs lust for the 
throats of organizations that they 
dislike before publishing a 
defamatory piece like "The Tiring 
Tradition of the Greek System."

Greeks scoutge college 

Editor: 
As Greg McCambridge asserts 

in the Feb. l3 Guardian, UCSD is 
a unique university. We have 
much to be proud of, from the 
idyllic setting of our campus to 
the outstanding qUillity of our 
student body. We also lack, for 
better or worse, many of the 
features of other major schools, 
like athletic scholarships and 
large social organizations. The 
growth of Greek organizations 
here appears to be in response 
to the feelings of many students 
that UCSD is tOO academic, that 
we attend a school which can 
satisfy the minds of its students 

but not their need for social 
release, for fun . But building 
fraternities and sororities to 
alleviate that problem is a 
solution which could extract a 
heavy tOil on both the members 
of these organizations and the 
university as a whole. 

McCambridge believes that we 
should welcome rather than fear the 
presence of Greeks at UCSD. That 
we should take pride in it. "Greeks 
provide more philanthropy, 
community service and social 
events than any other student 
organizations on campus." Let's be 
serious. I have yet to find a 
fraternity or sorority member who 
joined in order to provide 
community service. To the 
contrary, such work is usually seen 
by members as a necessary chore. 
The Greek organizations feel 
obligated to put on a show of 
community support each quarter 
for little reason other that their 
n~ed of something besides their 
social function to point to as a 
purpose. But ask any member how 
much time they have devoted in 
the past quarter to philanthropic 
pursuits, and then how much to 
their organization'S social rituals 
and parties. By a wide margin, 
members spend their hours on 
panying far more than on raising 
money for charity. The service 
minded students aren't joining 
fraternities. They are in service 
clubs or doing field work. where 
they have the satisfaction of 
knowing that their hours are truly 
benefitting the community. They 
are not there because the 
organization they pay dues to is 
compelling their presence .. 

Perhaps the social 
opportunities that the Greeks 
provide justifies their presence 
on campus. It is hard to deny 
that the social atmosphere at 
UCSD pales in comparison to 
that at SDSU, or even at other 
UC campuses. Is it not to our 
student body's benefit to have 
more panies and other events at 
which to relax? Of course it is, 
and it is clearly what the Greek .

organizations do best. Yet it does 
extract price. Most of the events 
by the Greek organizations are 
only for the Greek organizations. 
Rather than serving students at 
large, the dubious benefits they 
provide are open only to the 
students that have become 
members. And it is hard to forget 
that membership is not available 
to everybody. Only persons 
approved by the current 
fraternity and sorority members 
can join. Luckily, the criteria is 
no longer as racist and bigoted 
as it once was. Approval 
nowadays is based primarily on 
making the right first impression. 
If the members like you, you're 
in. If you aren't pretty enough, 
aren't wild enough, if you are too 
shy or too talkative, if you are 
just a bit too wierd for a 
member's taste, you're JUSt not 
good enough. Of course, "not 
good enough" is not olTicially 
what students rejected from the 
organizations are called. Ask any 
of the many bright, friendly and 
otherwise worthwhile people 
who were kept out how such 
rejection felt. That is part of the 
price paid to keep these groups 
exclusive, to keep them 
homogenized enough so that no 
member ever has to work to 
build a friendship . 

That is far from the only price 
of having Greek organizations on 
campus.As is readily apparent on 
other campuses, fraternities and 
sororities tend to dominate 
campus life. Students who would 
otherwise work in more directed 
pursuits, whether in student 
government, on publications, or 

' even in special interest groups, 
are trained to put first allegiance 
towards their Greek organization. 
Penalties are imposed upon 
members for non-participation m 
Greek activities, if only to ensure 
that members realize that Greek 
work has priority over other 
activities. Besides the time 
invested, Greek organizations 
insist that students put their 
money into the club. Students, 
even those living off loans and 
financial aid, are expected to pay 
hundreds of dollars for 
membership, and even more in 
penalties for missed club

As Greeks say, they find

The University of California, San Diego is still caught up in 
the celebration of its 25th anniversary. However, the 
administration's euphoria is not shared by the People of Color 
and certain women who make up part of the student body, a 
portion of the faculty and many staff members. In what has 
been deemed "Spirit Night," planned for this Tuesday evening, 
the various organizatiOns that make up SMC are planning a 
march through the campus. This march will take place on 
Wednesday and will culminate with a rally at the Revelle Plaza. 
There will be speakers who will articulate the climate that exists 
on the campus. Issues that will be discussed are: 

> Affirmative Action 
>Racism on Campus 
·Research vs. Education 
·Divestment from South Africa 
·Sexism on Campus 
·Other items of interest to People of Color and Women 
Support the rally by partiCipating, it IS important.

Students can tty to build that

coUeges by participating in 
college events and programs. Or 
they can devote their time 
towards other university 
activities, based on their interests 
and goals. Either way, they will 
benefit the school, the 
community and themselves. They 
will acquire a collection of

develop some antipathies. 
Joining Greek organizations will

For many students, the best 
coUege experiences do not come 
from making instant friendships. 
They come from getting to know, 
to like or to dislike, the people 
that we work with , play with, 
and live with. Building 
friendships with those who repel 
us or challenge us is at the heart 
'of personal growth . The diversity 
of people at UCSD is small in 
comparison to that found at 

Berkeley and other major 
universities. The diversity found 
in groups which aim to exclude 
people with difTereences is even 
smaller. That lack of exposure , 
the lack of being forced to 
confront the real world certainly 
must take some toll on the 
students who choose their 
friends from a carefully 
screened, perfectly qualified 
group.

Earlier this year, I anended a

the workers at the event were 
there I knew because they are 
participants in college 
government. But on the nametags 
they wore was no indication of 
their committee or even college 
affiliation . First and foremost, 
they wanted to be identified with 
the fratemity they had just 
joined. At the schools where 
Greek organizations are large, 
they tend to dominate the lives 
of their members and the 
character of their schools. I fear 
that one day students here will 
see themselves as Alpha

Candidates seek 
student votes 
By SUZANNE LlFSON, Associate News Editor 

T HE TONE WAS LESS than serious last Friday when 11 of the 14 San Diego 
mayoral candidates spoke at 
UCSD duri!1g one of the final 
rounds of speeches before the 
primary election on Tuesday. 

Topics such as mass transit, 
low income student housing and 
rent control received the most 
attention at the ASUCSD 
sponsored forum, which 
attracted a crowd of several 
hundred students. 

The forerunners of the election 
are floyd Morrow, Maureen 
O'Connor and Bill Cleator, (who 
often appear in television 
commercials and newspaper 
articles.) 

In response to the subject of 
student housing, Morrow, former 
democratic councilman said that 
as mayor, he would "exercise 
leadership and lobby for ~gents 
that would support low income 
housing." Morrow continued to 
say that the- pragmatic, most 
economic thing to do would be 
to take and inventory of the 
land, lease it, then rent to 
students. 

"The university owns a g~at 
deal of land here . . , all they have 
to do is lease it to people who 
win build low income housing," 
Morrow said. 

Morrow, an attomey and 
businessman, is in favor of rent 
control and cited the elderly 

community near the Sports Arena 
area where controlled rent had 
proved successful thus far. 

"Competitive housing is the 
best form of rent control," 
Morrow said. 

O'Connor, also a democratic 
former councilmember, lost 10 
Hedgecock by four percentage 
points in 1983. If elected, she 
plans to elicit lots of "community 
participation and planning 
groups," so tf\at the groups 
represent the people living there, 
O'Connor's campaign manager 
Ladonna Hatch said. 

Hatch stated that the problem 
of "affordable housing" is of 
importance to O'Connor and 
that she will explOit potential 
"profits to finance various 
programs, consisting of public 
and private companies," 
especially in the downtown area. 
O'Connor wants to develop 
public land withtrivate industry 
funds, Hatch sai , 

CiealOr, a republican city 
councilmember, said that if 
housing costs would rise because 
of changes by city planners, he 
would vote- against them. 

This is his second attempt at 
the mayoral position. 

"I think .,. the biggest problem 
facing San Diego is that citizens 
out there are concemed about 
their leadership and I think that 
they're desiresome (sic) of 
somebody coming in and all of a 

sudden getting the ship on the 
right course and I think I can do 
that," Cleator was quoted as 
saying in the L.A. Times. 

Morrow, in suppOrt of a new 
mass transit system, stated that 
Paci fic Beach is where a trolley 
should be "rather than inland." 
Morrow added that it would not 
take much effort, "aU you have to 
do is close off a street." 

The need for local mass transit 
is another mayoral topiC of 
discussion. O'Connor purchased 
trollies from Germany worth $11 
million each and sold them to 
private companies on a sale-
lease-back condition, according 
to Tim O'Connell, a member of 
O'Connor's campaign staff. The 
distributer pays lease purchase 
payments to private interest 
which allows private companies 
to depreciate the cars and 
receive a tax credit, O'ConneU 
said. 

O'Connor feels that more 
affordable housing near campus 
and the implementation of a 
trolley system would help 
alleviate the problem of red 
curbing on Torrey Pines, 
O'Connell said. He added, "The 
university and city need co 
cooperate and put pressure on 
the state." He continued' to say 
that people crossing busy Torrey 
Pines are in danger and that 
something needs to be done 
about student parkin~. 

Morrow also addressed the 
subject of the parking shortage 
and said that "the university had 
an obligation, a responsibility to 
provide parking that isn't slung 
out all over the place. I don't 
understand their reasoning ... 
parking structures are very 
inexpensive. " 

Both Morrow and O'Connor

stated that they are in favor of 
divestment from South Africa. "I 
want to make sure we're out of 
there. When someone's messing 
over someone, we should balance 
the scales," Morrow said. 

When asked whether 
O'Connor plans to force the city 
retirement board to follow the 
initiative of the city council, 
which voted to divest all of the 
city of San Diego's funded 
companies that invest in South 
Africa, her staffmember replied 
that O'Connor 'can make a 
statement when elections come; 
she can suggest, but she cannot 
direct them." 

ClealO~ has told the 
development industry that it 
must start working with 
environmentalists. Also, Cleator 
called for a task force to study 
:he purchase of more city open 
space, according to the L.A. 
Times. 

NEWS 

Close behind the three major 
candidates is Mary Christian-
Heising, a political scientist 
involved in several public 
services, including being current 
chairman of a San Diego housing 
advisory appeals board. 

"We're lOsing more of our 
public rights all the time. 
Housing needs to be 
expanded ... we 're creating one 
gheno after another," Heising 
said. 

Other mayoral candidates who 
spoke at Revelle Plaza were Loch 
David Crane, John Kelley, 
Raymond Eugene Peters, 
Nicholas Rexford Walpert and 
Vernon Ed. Watts, Jr. 

If a candidate does nO( receive 
more than 50 percent of votes, 
then a run-ofT will occur on June ' 
3 betwen the tOP twO 
finishers. 

Mayoral candidate Bill Cleator sptaks out on hOUSing costs.

"The decision of the council 
was not based on the 
individuals," Alexander said. 
"They were both just names on 
paper to most in the room ." 

According to McCoy, Chavez 
would have been a good choice 
for the positton, but Harris had 
attended all the meetings and 
she felt he offered a strong 
alternative Viewpoint. . 

"He gave me a lot of good 
ideas and seemed like a good 
candidate," she said of Harris, "I 
assumed that he would be 
picked on my recommendation. I 
didn't know anyone else had 
applied for the position." 

McCoy now feels she should 
have avoided the whole maner . . 
"There was a lack of 
communication between Ariel 
and me," she said. "I should 
have left it to his (Ariel's) 
decision." 

Harris, at first enthusiastic 
about the position, has turned 
cynical about the whole process. 

"I'm beginning (0 feel like a 
pawn," he said Friday. "This 
comminee is complete bullshit, 
we need more time. The 
comminee is powerless." 

"I think the AS has to become 
more vulnerable and the 
alternative media has to become 
more flexible," he said , adding 
that the new funding regulations 
imposed on the altemative 
media by the AS were poor 
planning. "Fahlbusch's idea is so 
goddamn unfair to eveyone 
involved. It's not fair to the 
students who read the papers, 
and it's nO( fair to the students 
putting out the paper." 

Harris said he would be 
willing to resign and have 
Chavez take over the position if 
it would make the committee 
more errective . 

Anguiano said he hoped his 
leaving will exemplify the current 
indifference in the AS and hopes 
the move will trigger a more 
responsible and representative 
council. ~ 

Taxis to prevent drunk driving 
By KRISTEN McCLEARY 

A WEEKEND TIPSY TAXI service for srudents may soon be implemented at 
UCSD, according to Sal Yeas, 
Revelle senior senator. 

Due to the rigid on-campus 
alcohol policy, a number 0 
students are travelling to 01T-
campus panies on weekends. 
This trend has substantially 
increased the incidence of 
driving while under the influence 
of alcohol . 

Yeas began organizing this 
project because he saw a deHnite 
need for safe transportation 
altematives. 

Modeled after a similar 
program at the UC Davis 
campus, this taxi service will be 
open to all UCSD students. Yeas 

arid Mary Rose Alexander, A.S. 
president, are forming the 
service to aid more than 
intoxicated drivers. 

"The service is also for others 
who want to leave a parry early 
or can't leave due to the fact that 
their driver is intoxicated," Yeas 
said. 

Students living on-campus can 
use the cabs free of charge. Yeas 
hopes to keep the taxis free for 
all but says this may nO( be 
possible if the students live tOO 
far off campus. 

The AS will pay $12 to reserve 
each taxi per evening, along with 
an a,dditional mileage charge. 

According to a needs 
assessment survey taken by Yeas 
and Alexander, the service areas

were on campus or in the La

only a few students mentioned 
the C1airemont Mesa area and a 
few hopefuls even requested

Yeas expects a mInimal 
mileage charge for out of the way 
areas to keep the service from 
being abused as a free shuttle 
service to and from Mexico. Off-
campus panies which expect a 
large commuter crowd will be ' 
encouraged to spend the $12 it 
takes to reserve a taxi for the 
entire evening.

Teacher Education Program 
A multicultural approach 
By DIANE RIGDON 

I N THE EARLY 19705 AT UCSD, during a time in which there were many 
student protestS and controversy, 
from the eye of the storm 
emerged a stable program, 

. UCSD's Teacher Education 
Program (IEP), afnIiated with 
Third College . 

Insisting upon a multicultural 
approach toward everything, 
Third College students 
demanded a teacher program 
which would cater to Black and 
Hispanic cultures. Hugh Mehan, 
TEP director, calls the students' 
efforts "sensitive to culture and 
trying to recruit from 
underrepresented groups." From 
the consultations of Dr. Paul 
Saltman, Dr. Roy Harvey Pearce, 
Dr. Don Norman and other 
driving forces behind TEP 
emerged a program with two 
foci: child-centered and 
multicultural education. TEP's 
undergraduate brochure 
describes its slam this way: 
"Multicultural education IS 
pluralistlc; it recognizes the 
unique heritage of different 
cultures and seek to preserve 
each child's cultural identity 
while proViding children with 
skills necessary to move between 
different cultural systems." 

TEP is accredited from the 
state of California and offers a 
multiple subjectS teaching 
credential (something many 
people do not know) for 
elementary school teachers with 
an optional bilingual emphasis, a 
M.A (Master of Arrs) in Teaching 
and Learning, and a minor in 
teacher education. 

Directing all this is professor 
of sociology Hugh Mehan . In 
1972, a Third College adviSOry 
committee appointed Mehan 
chief coordinator after 
conducting a carnpuswide and 
nationwide search. Mehan, at 
that time, was teaching at the 
University of Indiana. His job, as 
he putS it, was to "create linkage 
and to put aD these forces 
together." 

Not being a department, TEP 
has to draw upon other 
departments' faculty members, 
but "we are selective," asserts 
RandaD Souviney, academic 
administrator. 

Chancellor Richard C. 
Atkinson is listed under faculty, 
but he has yet to teach a TEP 

course; his position being 
honorary, a gesture of supporty 
of the program. TEP operates on 
an undisclosed budget with very 
close ties to UCSD's 
administration. "The Chancellor 
has been very supportive of us. It 
has shown in budget aUocations," 
remarks Souviney. 

TEP instructors conduct 
intense research. Mehan, 
Souviney, Margart Rile and others 
recently wrote a book The Write 
Help, instructing teachers how lO 
use computers in the classroom. 
According to Souviney, TEP 
graduates only 30 studentS per 
year, and has a puhlicity 
problem. Souviney hopes 
studentS reading this article will 
"know we are here: "Last 
application year, we had 80 
interested, 50 applicants and 30 
admitted," informs Souviney. 

multicultural education. 
2. Experience working with 
children in educational 
environments, especially 
multicultural ones. 
3. Involvement in 
community service. 
4. Academic excellence 
(studentS must maintain an 
overall 2.5 GPA through 
graduation.) 

ApplicantS to TEP must bear up 
under intense scrutiny, reviewed 
by a committee of faculty, and 
TEP alumni. 

TEP does not limit itS students 
to any ethnic group, but there is 
a preponderance of bilingual 
Mexican-American students ' 
among whom the popular major 
is Spanish literature. 

Mehan says the program 
delibertely limitS itself to a low 
number of studentS so "we can 
have the very best: According to 
him, traditionally teachers have 
been gleaned from the C grade 
group or worse because the 
bener students have not wanted 
to enter a profession in which 
they are treated so thanklessly. 

When asked if the program 
might be difficult for studentS to 
enter if they are from no 
particular ethnic group, have 
only the desire to teach , and 
have no multicultural experience, 
Souviney suggestS that 
"multiculturalism works two ways. 
We want a Mexican-American 
student to be interested in a 
culture other than his own. Also, 
if a student has no multicultural 
experience, we suggest he do 
volunteer work in an ethnic 
community, volunteer to heIp a 
teacher in a school in an ethnic 
neighborhood and travel a lot." 

Randall Souviney. academic adminstrator suggests that in TEP "multi-
cullUra/ism works in two ways. We want a Mexican-American to be 
interested in a culture other than his own." 

On this nOle , Salrman, who 
never took a teaching class 
himself, believing "knowledge 
and enthusiasm" to be the only 
prerequisites to being an 
effective teacher, teUs this 
anecdote. I ast month, while he 

The program proper, 
described as "rigorous" by 
Souviney, lastS a year and a half. 

its graduates use the bilingual 
emphasis. Mehan says the 
starting salary for a teacher is 
$20,000 compared to $27 ,900 for 
a person with a B.A. in computer 
science. . 

Mehall further characterizes 
his graduates as people who 
won't accept the status quo. They 
are people who are moving 
rapidly into administrative 

"If a student has no multicultural experience, we suggest he 
do volunteer work in an ethnic community ... help a teacher in 
an ethnic neightborhood and travel a lot." 

- Randall Souviney, academic administrator 

was surfing, he encountered on 
the surfboard next to him a 
young man, a graduate of TEP 
and Third College who taught in 
Oakland schools until he 
"burned-oUl" because of lack of 
respect and discipline from his 
studentS. Now he works in a 
tuna fleet, making more money 
than as a teacher. 

Preserving a "cream of the 
crop' idea, TEP admin istrators 
relentlessly seek sruden[S which 
meet these (our criteria: 

1. A strong interest in 

State law limitS teacher education 
programs to this length of time. 
TraditionaRy, women at UCSD 
have made up the greatest 
number in the program. Most 
students begin in their senior 
year. A student is advised to 
complete a major before entering 
TEP, because rEP's courses are 
so far-reaching, since science 
majors have found TEP difficult 
because they have so many 
major sequences. 

Applying TEP's credential to 
the working world, about half of 

positions; not necessarily in 
bilingual schools. 

On a related subject, Souviney 
believes, "Language decisions are 
almost never based on 
pedagogical evidence, but almost 
always on political issues. In the 
United States, Spanish does not 
have the "stature" like French 
and German have." 

TEP doesn't train its studems 
in language but tests them for 
oral and wrine n proficiency for 
the bilingual emphasis. 

Mehan argues the bilingual 

emphasis is based on 
demographic, cultural and 
economic reasons. " In large 
uman centers, the majority of 
people will be from ethnic 
backgrounds by the year 2000. 
You and I have to know about 
the cultural backgrounds of our 
students, if only to be able lO 
teach them. If we do not develop 
these people's education to their 
fuDest potential, we , as a society, 
will lose precious national 
resources." 

Every six or seven years TEP 
has to receive new accreditation. 
The Commission for Teacher 

_ Credentialing, an offshoot of the 
Sacramento-based California 
State Board of Education , 
accredited TEP again January 30. 
UCSD's TEP has never lost its 
good standing among review 
boards. This panel reviews 
everyone in California who eams 
a credential. 

According to Mehan, another 
event under discussion at TEP is 
a possible secondary (high 
school) teacher program. 

A goal of TEP Mehan says is to 
get gifted students at UCSD to 
consider teaching as a career. "I 
am sure we could have some 
effect on local schools."

A healing excursion to the homeland 
By EVA WONG 

W HEN I FIRST heard about Chinese Studies 150, an intensive 
field course which WDuld 
eventually lead to mainland 
China itself, Eric and I were still 
together. 

I first heard about the class in 
some passing remarks Hu laD shi 
(the teacher of the class, Mrs. 
Hu) made in First Year Chinese 
during the fall quarter of my 
freshman year at UCSD. 

As the months proceeded , and 
as my interest in Chinese Studies 
grew, I became more and mDre 
interested in visiting this fDreign 
and mysterious land ... a place of 
which I knew nothing about, yet 
was still supposedly my 
homeland. 

Though First Year Chinese 
was a relatively small class in 
size compared to other freshman 
classes such as Cflem. 6A and 
Humanities 12A, and the fact 
that you got to know the lao shi 
on a personal level, I stiD wasn't 
ready to approach her for mDre 
details Dn the tour of China 
offered to UCSD students. 

Instead, I asked Eric, and he 
was interested in going as well. 
Fortunately, Hu lao shi passed 
out pamphletS and informatiDn 
Dn the trip, and my parents were 
enthusiastic about sending me 
along. Even so, I barely got the 
registratiDn fees in Dn time, and 
Eric eventually lost interest in the 
excursion. 

Friends of mine were going on 

the trip with me, even thDugh 
Eric wasn't. As time passed , and 
Dur departure date drew closer, 
we spDke about the trip often, 
exciting each other in 
speculating about it together. 
None of us really knew what to 
think, although [ was sure that It 
would be a learning experience; 
because China is a country that 
not many people have been to. 

About this time, Eric and ) 
broke up. TD say that it was a 
painful break-up seemed to be 

putting it very, and r mean very 
Iighdy then. [ was SD depressed 
during the last month and a half 
of my first year at college that 
the upcDming trip to China in 
June was the only glimmer of 
hope that got me through the 
rest of the spring quarter. I had 
completely lost myself in my first 
"real" relationship. If you ask 
anyone now who knew me then 
they'd tell you that I was a wreck 
and a total zombie, who went 
through the motions of school

and life. 
In just four short months, [ 

had allDwed myself to merge into 
Eric's life; he played a part in 
everything I did . During the 
course Df Dur relatiDnship, I had 
never stopped to ask the 
question, "Where does the end 
of you become the start of me?" 
which was, to me, a very 
meaningful line from a popular 
song. It wasn't until afterward 
that [ realized that that was what 
had happened to me. When he 

left, I didn't feel like I was a 
whole person any more: half or 
maybe even all of me was gone; I 
felt that Eric had absorbed my 
essence and taken "me" away. 

Though China is as old and as 
ancient as civilization itself, it' 
offered me "new" hope, not Dnly 
because I was gening away on a 
much needed vacation from San 
Diego and UCSD, but also 
because it promised the 
opportunity to ~eveal to me 
ancient, unimagined secretS Df a 
past, my own past in a sense , 
that was alien to me. In a 
communication class I took this 
past fall quarter, we were taught 
from Orwell's 1984 that a 
persDn's future lies in their past. 
Boy, did I live and learn this 
principle during my summer 
session in China. 

To my ancestors and my 
immediate family, the desire fDr 
finding wealth and riches in the 
financial sense was fulfilled in 
coming to America and to 
CalifDrnia: "j in shan," the land of 
the gDlden mountains. But wealth 
and riches of another, more 
important kind came to me in 
the country my family had left 
and lied during the 1950s and 
earlier. My p,uentS, who met 
here in America (in San Diego , 
as a maner of fact), went back to 
China for the first time in more 
than 30 years. They left a week 
after I arrived home from my 
trip.

that, no matter what happens to 
me, she'll be there fOr me. Is it 
wrong to be that dependent on a 
relationship? 

Some people think that 
separating us would be the best 
thing for us. They say it would 
help us discover our own 
separate identities apan from tho.: 
other twin. But, as it is, we don't 
do everything together. Some of 
our classes are di fferent and not 
all of our extracurricular activities 
are the same. Others think we 
have a beautiful relationship and 
that we should maintain it as 
long as we can. I listen to them 
more often. 

This might sound strange, but 
I feel more alive and wild when 
I'm with my twin. Ellen is like a 
spring board for me; we playoff 
each other so well. I don't mind 
being off the wall when she's 
around because I know she'U 
cover my tracks if I say 
something stupid. It's the same 
for Ellen. We're more daring 
together, more confident. 

Ellen and I won speech 
awards in high shcool for dual 
interpretation of a piece. Our 
timing was perfect; we could 
anticipate each other's 
mannerisms, inflections and 
nonverbal cues instinctively. We 
frequently finish each other's 
sentences or say something in 
unison. 

We laugh because it often 
happens when we're talking 
about something important and 
we each think we're saying 
something profound and 
original. It 's not telepathy; it's 
what happens when you've been 
together for so long. Over the 
summer, we took pan in a 
psychological study and 
discovered that we had the same 
brain wave patterns. It wasn 't 
that surprisi ng; we knew it all 
along. 

I don't know what I would do 
if something homble happened 
to her. It would be difficult to 
pick up the pieces of my life. 
Somehow I would find the 
strength to live on, I believe, but 
it would never, could never be 
the same. I would diminish as a 
person. A pan of me would be 
gone forever, it would be like 
losing my right arm. I cry at the 
thought of that. If God is a 
lOVing God, I pray that He has 
the decency to let us die 

togethe~. GeneraUy, I try not to 
dwell on such a depressing idea. 

When people ask me silly 
question like, "Are you twins or 
sisters?" or (to one of us) "How 
old are you?" then turning to the 
other, one "And how old are 
you?" I just laugh and answer 
their questions. Sometimes 
people are authenticaUy 
interested in our relationship 
and ask things like, "Did you 
have your own language when 
you were kids?" or 'When one 
gets hun, does the other one feel 
it?" I don't mind answering these 
questions because it makes me 
think. 

My mother said that we used 
to jabber to ourselves, like a 
secret code, but that died out by 
the time we were 18 months old. 
As far as feeling each other's . 
pain, I know when she is upset 
sometimes, even when I'm not 
around her, but it isn 't a tangible 
pain . We reany haven't separated 
long enough to give a full answer 
to that que sCIon. 

I'm Emma-Lee, not Ellen. I 
have my own interests and goals 
apan from my sister's, but don 't 
expect me [0 make teUing us 
apart easy for you. You're on 
your own! ~ 

Healing 
Continued from page I} 

I went to China with no 
expectations, because what little I 
knew of China was clouded in 
an aura of mystery and intrigue. 

Because I had no set 
premonitions of what China was 
like; there wasn't anything it had 
to live up to. I saw myself as a 
sponge, that took in every little 
nuance offered to me by this 
ancient country and its people. 

While I was there, I 

discovered more than I had 
hoped to. During an exhausting 
four week tour of the vast 
country of China,. I found the 
true definition of what "real" 
friends are . My cousin Karen, my 
very best friend, came with me, 
and Arlene. who is also Karen's 
best friend, evolved into being 
mine as well. Along with the help 
of these friends and others, 
China became my 
"homecoming," in that I had 
come home to something I had 
lost. I was beginning to whole 
again, through both the past 
knowledge China and its people 
offered, and the new knowledge 
and insight I gained from my

Ka11lansky goes wild; 
UC destroys Cougars 
By MATI UIT, Staff Writer 

FOR THE ARST TIME THIS season the Tritons had the opportunity to know what 
it really means to have the home 
team advantage, as they rushed 

th~ San Bernardino Cougars 108-
87 , in front of a packed and 
vocal Triton Pavillion . 

The Tritons played inspired 
ball before the Spirit Night 
crowd. In the early moments of 
the game, freshman Mark 
Sutherlin made an intimidating 
dunk to give UCSD a 5-4 lead 
which they never relinquished. 

The Cougars made a 
comeback in the first half, tying 
thr game at 25 after being down 
by as much as nine poims. But 
the Tritons, aided by the loud 

fan support, built the lead up to 
12 at halftime including two 
points at ther buzzer from Greg 
Kamansky's 20-foOl Jump shot. 

The halftime festivities were 
almost as entertaining as the 
game. The four colleges, which 
were divided into groups, 
competed for the best cheer. 
Third College won the heated 
contest with a song they made 
up, led by SIX transvestite 
cheerleaders. It IS rumored, 
however, that the competltlOn 
was marred with cheating. 
Apparently the cheerleaders 
unfairly tempted the judges With 
their provocauve paper cleavage. 

The second half was 
dominated by the Tntons and 
was marked by the outstandmg 
performance of jUnlor Greg 
Kamansky Kamansky put on a 
shooting clinic Tor San 
Berdardino as he set a school 
record for most field goals in a 
game, gomg 16 for 20 and 
scoring 36 total points. 

"Kamansky was unbelievable," 
said coach Marshall. "Greg and 
the whole team were so pumped 
up when they saw the crowd. 
This is how it should be. We 
wish we could have this aU the 
time." 

Kamansky said that playing in 
front of a crowd like this was an 
"awesome feeling." He said, "It 
makes all the difference In the 
game 

"It pumps you up. It's great to 
play like this . It's eXCiting," 
added Mark Sutherlin. 

Jim Smith , who came off the 

bench to score 10 points, said 
that this rype of ran support 
from UCSD was "unusual but 
really great." 

Another player who came off 
the bench to score 10 was Thor 
Dekker. He also led the team in 
rebounds with nine and 
according to Marshall, "hustled 
hiS butt off again." 

Other exceptional 
performances in the lopsided 
contest, which ended 108-87 
were by Brian Backens, who had 
18 points and always plays 

Kamanshy pours in two of his 39. 

conSistently well , and Bill Reese 
with 10. The Tritons shot a 
remarkable 63.6 percent from the 
field . 

The next home game is the 
last game or the season arid 
should prove to be an exciting 
one. It will be a rematch with 

Bill Reese and Romal Haymond battle a San Bernardino player for a rebound. 

UCSD's men's track team defeated Chapman College this wtel/end 73-61. The UC women lost 53-52. 

crosstown Division I school 
US[U. The Tritons lost earlier 
this season in a close COOlest. If 
the Tntons win this game coach 
Marshall feels UCSD has a 
chance for an at-large berth at 
the playoffs. The game is this 
Tuesday at 7:30. ~

As the sun set on the horizon, 
the lights came on and the 
Tritons went down. UC Santa 
Barbara prevailed in Saturday's 
lacrosse game by 13 goals, 16-) 
over UCSD. 

Earlier in the week, Bates 
College from Maine crushed the 
Tritons 17-2 and beat UCSB 
Friday night by 5 goals. Scoring 
for the Tritons Saturday were 

D~vid O'Rourke, Scot! Ndrman 
and Phil Johnson. The Gauchos 
controlled the tempo throughout 
the first three quarters as the 
final quarter saw the Tritons 
match UCSB with twO goals 
each. The Tritons were also 
hampered by penalties once 
again. 

-::oach Pope was obviOUsly 

upset at his team's performance, 
and is looking forward to next 
week as the Tritons will get an 
earlier start this Saturday ( 11 am 
at Muir Field) against the . 
University of Arizona. The 
Tritons need this one to keep their 
hopes alive for the playoffs. 

Rugby 
UCSD won both games against 

Claremont Saturday afternoon as 
two penalty kicks enabled the 
Tritons to emerge victorious 6-0 
in the first team's home opener. 
The B team was also victorious 
as a long afternoon of tough play 
proved to be effective. This 
weekend the ruggers take on 
Occidental Saturday, March I, at 
1 pm on Muir Field . 

Timeless T oumey All-Star selections 
As we near tourney time, it's time to choose our 

All-American NCAA team. These decisions, based 
upon endless amounts of television research, are 

subjective, and, as you will undoubtedly see, 
indicative of our own regional and personal bias. 
Despite aU this, we're giving our perspective on 
what has been an immensely successful season for 
college hoop. 

Schacht's picks 
CENTER: Roy Tarpley is the primary reason 
Michigan has been near the top all year. In a thin 
year for the center position , this senior is the class 
of his class. Look for Memphis State junior William 
Bedford to dominate next year after laying the 
foundation for the future this rear. 
SMALL FORWARU. Lenny Bias 01 Maryland may be 
the best player in the nation. No one wants the pill 
down the stretch more than Bias. Not only that, he 
can play "D," too. Reggie Williams of Georgetown 
has kept the Hoyas in the spodight despite the loss 
of Ewing. 
POWER FORWARD: To choose between Danny 
Manning of Kansas and Walter Berry of St. Johns is 
impossible. So we won't. Suffice it to say both are 
the cornerstOnes of their respective teams and the 
reasons why the Redmen and Jayhawks are in 
contention. 
OFF GUARD: Johnny Dawkins plays defense, can 
shu0t, rebound and sky with the best of them -
the real reason Duke is the number one team in the 
nation . Milt Wagner of Louisville and Anthony 
Watson of San Diego State tie for second place . Too 
bad Watson's talents go unnoticed in the basketball 
.vacuum of San Diego. 

POINT GUARDS: Pearl Washington raises a lot of 
questions with his flamboyant style, but the junior 
from Syracuse is ready to rise to the occasion when 
it's money time. David Rivers of Notre Dame gets 
honorable mention, but Mark Price of Georgia Tech 

gets the nod for leading the Yellowjackets Out of 
nowhere-land into the promised land. 
COACH OF THE YEAR: His name is 
unpronouncable, and looks like an eyechart, but his 
coaching prowess has led the Blue Devils of Duke 
into the ACC spotlight this year. Mike Kryzewski 
has taken a team without a pivot man and made it 
one of the most powerful teams in the nation. 

Santoyo's picks 
POINT GUARD: Mark Price (Georgia Tech) -
anyone who is under 6 feet and can survive in this 
game of giants must be an amazing talent and Mark 
Price is Just that. An immaculate passer and a 
pinpoint outside shooter, no one leads the faS( 
break better than Price. Pearl Washington (Syracuse) 
- Pearl is big, a consistent shooter and has all the 
shake-and-bake that will gain him great success in . 
the NBA, but his handling skiUs do not compare 
with Price. 
OFF GUARD: Johnny Dawkins (Duke) - Dawkins 
does it aU , and his backcourt teammate Tommy 
Amaker makes the twO probably the best tandem off 
guard9"in the nation. Steve Alford (I ndiana) - He 
plays for Bobby Knight and he still hasn 't gone 
hardship - great outside shooter and sound in 
virtually every fundamental. 
CENTER: Daugherty (North Carolina) - For big 
men, thIS guy has great mobility and a sweE't 
outside jumper. 
SMALL FORWARD: Reggie Williams (Georgetown) 
and Reggie Miller (UCLA) - Although there may be 
great arguments in this category, these Reggies are 
bona fide stars. Williams is a slashing, George 
Gervin-type player with incredible speed. Miller is 
an astounding outside shooter who can hit the 25 
footer with regularity. 
POWER FORWARD: Len Bias (Maryland) - After 
his performance against North Carolina, I would 
like to be his agent. Bias possesses the brute 
rebounding strength of a Moses Malone and the 
smooth shot of an Alex English .
