No UCSD 
Iranians To 
Be Deported 

By Eric Jaye 
All of UCSD's Iranian 

students are apparently safe 
from deportation. 

The students had their visas 
c hecked Friday at the 
Immigration and Naturali-
zation Office downtown 
without major incident. 

Only one student did not 
pass the initial check and was 
referred , to the INS 
Investigation Division, but 
International Center Director 
Phyllis Clark described the 
problem as minor and 
expected that he would be 
allowed to stay in the country. 

Clark, who was downtown 
Friday helping UCSD's 53 
Iranians through the check, 
said there was some 
apprehension and nervous-
ness among the students but 
that most of them were "glad 
to get it over." 

Other Iranian , students in 
the county, however , ha ve not 
fared as well as those from 
UCSD. 

192 of the 1023 Iranian 
students already checked 
"appear to be deportable." 
according to INS Director 
Robert Mitton. 

If an Iranian's student 
paperllO are not in order at the 
initial check, Mitton said, he is 
sent to the Investigation 
Division, which detennines If 
he should appear before an 
Immigration judge. 

If that judge rules againlit 
the litudent, he may take hili 
case to an Immigration 
Appeals court. If that court 
also rules for depo,rtation, the 
student may then take his case 
to the federal courts. 

The INS estimates there are 
1500 to 1800 Iranian 
students in the county. All 
must have their visas checked 
by the INS before December 
14 or be immediately eligible 
for deportation, Mitton said. 

In order to be safe from 
deportation an !ranian student 
muat be carrying a full load of 
daasea at the Univerliity or 
college listed on his visa and 
not be employed illegaUy, 
according to Immigration 
Officer Bob Kent. 

Though the INS waa "not 
hettitant" to recommend 
deportation, according to 
Kent, they were willing to 
accept credible explanations 
for irregularities on a student's 
records_

Kennedy Med 
School Stop 
Is Uneventful 

By Jeff Beresford-Howe 
News Editor 

Ted Kennedy's presidential campaign came to the UCSD 
Medical School lor an hour Friday, The visit produced nothing 
e'xtraordinary on the national politiCal lICene, but ga ve the campus 
a look at a man many think will succeed his brother as president. 

Kennedy stuck to his tight schedule and spoke with scientislli at 
the Lipid Research Center for approximately fifteen minutes. He 
then walked a few yards to Winzer Commons, where he !ipOke 
with students for approximately one-half hour on US health care 
policy, a fi~ld long a favorite of the senator's. 

Immediately after the discussion, he was whisked to the airport 
for a meeting with San Diego politiciana, then to Loli Angeles, 
where his important political business of the day, meetings with 
Chicano and legal activists. took place. 

But Kennedy'!> presence on campus wa!> enough to to line the 
path betweem the Center and the Commons with 300 people 
trying to get a glimpse of the senator. About 30 protestors alllO 
took the opportunity to make their viewpoint known to the senator 
and the national and local press. 

The protesters carried signs dealing with a wide variety of 
Issues. 

The Socialist Workers Party and the Young Americans for 
Freedom (who dubbed Kennedy "the $65 billion man" for hi" 
national health in!>urance proposal) both quietly carried sign!>, as 
did "pro-Americans" urging that the US send no military 
equipment to Iran. Equal Rights Amendment supporters aiao 
picketed the press. 

(Kennedy favors the ERA) 
Shouts of "we love you" 

drew smile!> from Kennedy 
and applaul>e from the crowd 
'as he left for the airport. 

Inaide the Commons, 
Ke n nedy ~ond ucted 8 
question and answer selOsion 
with students involved in 
campus health care organ-
izations. 

Chairman of the Senate 
Health Committee, Kennedy 
told the students that this 
nation has "missed an 
important opportunity for 
leadership in the health field, 
especially in the area of 
immunity. 

"We could be helping 
countries develop their own 
immunization plans. With 
dramatically little resources, 
we can make a larger impact. 
But we don ' t need that

Check on Kennedy 
Continued from page 1 
station wagons carrying 
servicemen and mounted rifles 
and machine guns traveled in 
back and in front of Kennedy's 
black, bulletproof limousine; 

-A city Special Weapons 
and Tactics (SWAT) team 
posted snipers and lookouts at 
the top of every building in the 
vicinty of the Lipid Research 
Center and Winzer Commons, 
where Kennedy spoke; 

-The SWAT team was 
complemented by a phalanx of 
San Diego motorcycle police 
clearing the path for 
Kennedy's limousine; 

-County police sent two 
officers, two German 
shepherds and a helicopter. 

One policeman, who asked 
not to be identified, admitted 
that the security had been 
intensified by the assassination 
of tht: senator's tw:o brothers. 

"How would you like to be a 
cop in the city the last 
Kennedy was as!>8s~inated 
in?" he said . 

There was only one M!curity 
incident during Kennedy's 
visit. 

A student confu!>ed by 
security lines r-ode behind the 
secret service on his bicycle 
and was stopped and 
questioned. He was released 
after being admonished to 
travel in "secured!' areas. 

Even the choice of the Lipid 
Research Cerlter for 
Kenned y' s tour was influenced 
by security concerns. 

The Center was chosen 
because of its proximity to 
Winzer (only a few steps 
away) and relative isolation (in 
an undeveloped Jot behind 
most of the med school), 
according to the secret service.'

emphasis on preventative

Chancellor William

Kennedy on the tour of the 
cenler, said he was impressed 
with Kennedy, and described 
him as "a strong supporter of 
research." , 

Lipid Center Director Freel 
Malison, who conducted the 
tour. said the senator was "far 
more informed than I would

have expected" about health 
care issues, adding that 
Kennedy had aided in getting

the American people.
