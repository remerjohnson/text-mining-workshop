fle;<ibiliry of temporary employees 
has proved beneficial to employers, 
there are many dcuiment.~1 aspects 
to the temp IIldustry; higher skIlled 
workers see more henefits, while 
compensation for lower killed

mation are dcscriptions of the dog labs that clear-
ly sta te that the animals used are privately bred, 
ITI1xcd-breed dog that are sedated before any 
snldent sees them. This contra ts sharply with 
thc photographs of purebred golden retriever 
puppies on the \ Veo page, which seem [Q eXist 
prlmanly for the purpose of II1censing the casual 
vi Itor. Thl seemlllgly minor discrepancy 
depiCts II1tense one-sidedness (rather than unbi-
ased la)~ng out ot facrs) and damages the cTedl -
bdity of thc advocates.

LEIIERS TO THE EDITOR 
Letter misrepresented 

lecture(s speech 
Editor. 

In his letter to you on Feb. 3, 
Evan Rowley egregiously misrep-
resented my remarks at the Jan . 30 
antiwar rally. I wish to reply to his 
false and potentially libelous state-
tllCnts. 

First, Evan, you attributed things 
to me that I did not ay. You stated 
that I "offered the oft-heard reasons 
not to suppon the war: the apparent 
hypocrisy in our suppOtt for Saddam 
Hussein in the 19805, the lack of 
suppon for war from France and 
Germany, and the ulterior motives 
of the Bush administration involving 
oil and industry." This is false. I 
made no reference, explicit or 
implicit, to the first or third points. I 
can only assume, since you claimed I 
said them, that you were not paying 
the slightest attention. On the sec-
ond point, I did not u e the words 
you attribute to me. I pointed out 
that many of our allies and the vaSt 
majority of the rest of the world are 
against this war, in tark contrast to 
the 1991 war with Iraq, which most 
(including my elf) supponed. My 
point was this glaring contrast 
should give Americans pause. 

Second, you misrepresented my 
remarks concerning posters and the 
U.S. Marines. I did 1101 state that 
srudents who tore down posters 
were connected in any way to the 
Marines, nor did I use the word 
"cowar dice" at all in my remarks. I 
teach my srudents to place quota-
tion marks onl y around actual 
quO[es; you would do well to follow 
that rule. I rlid urge tho e who 
"want to kick Iraqi ass" to join the 
Marines. This wa not a slur on the 
Marines; it was a pointed reminder 
that those who are speaking loudest 
for war around campus will nO[ be 
the one dying in Iraq. The Marines 
are often put in hann's way first, 
and If loudmouthed "patriots" 
claim to want to "fight Iraq," they 
should join. If not , they should 
modi fy their rhetOriC to, "We 
should send someone else to fight 
Iraq." All I'm asking for is honesty. 

As for my opiOion of the 
Marines, I have numerou close 
fri ends and family members who 
are or were Marines. Several won 
the Purple Heart. One is dead. The 
best man at my wedding was, like 
you, a corporal in the Marines. 

Finally, I take offense at your 
irresponsible juxtaposition of 
images. You wrote, "Here is ome-
thing to thinle about, Cardoza: It 
does not take courage to come to the 
Price Center for lunch ... , wave a 
sign and wear a T-shitt that says 
'Fuck Bush.''' This implies that I was 
doi ng those things. You wiU recall 
tlut I wore a gray wool suit, white 
shm and green tie, and I resent your 
attempt to associate my name with 
simple-minded and offensive behav-
ior. If you wish to be worthy of the 
uniform you wear, avoid such tactics 
and argue politics based on the aetu-
aI arguments of your opponents. 
First, you will have to talc.e the trou-
ble to listen to what they are saying.

Suicide article insults 
those with depression 

Editor: 
I would lilc.e to condemn the 

opinion article written about the 
suicide of Natali e Summerfish. 
First of ali, an opinion so negative-
ly reproachful of the poor girl and 
her actions IS extremely inappro-
priate and disrespectful to her fam-

ily and friends, when Summerfish 
has received no obituary or 
remembrance. Secondly, how can 
one so boldly assume the position 
to write an opinion on suicide 
when the author herself has never 
suffered from depression or experi-
enced the same degree of despair' 

How can this author possibly 
make such bold, outrageous 
assumptions about how 
Summerfish was luling before and 
during the act? This is extremely 
inappropriate and selfish on the 
author's part, not that of the poor 
girl. Let her rest in peace. She 
obviously had a hard time and very 
little support while she was alive -
at least give her some support now. 

I suffer from depression, but I 
sought help. even though it is very 
hard for me to confront it. You can't 
JUSt "snap out of it." I am very angry 
at the Guordiall for allowing some-
one to write about suicide without 
first researching what depression is, 
because the author shows no signs 
of any knowledge about depression. 
Allowing her to write commentary 
on SUlTUnerfishl; every move lead-
ing up to the act as if it were a game 
of football is just sad . I think 
SUlTUnerfi hI; parents and friends 
deserve an apology from your paper. 

The author has the audacity to 
tell other to be more com pas ion-
ate beyond uperficial greetings, 
and then she callously turns 

" As students attaining high, 
er education at a top state, 
funded university I are you

Celebrity. stump'ing is a 
compllcatecf issue 

Editor. 
Dustin Frel ich's column in the 

Feb. 20 issue of the Guardian 
("Celebrity critiques of warfare 
misguided") begins by debating an 
interesting point: the correctness of 
using ones celebrity status to foster 
political views. Unfortunately, the 
article soon trails into irrelevance 
by pitting (unconvincingly, in my 
view) the author's own opinion 
ag:ainst Dave Matthews'. That on 
an important topic like war in Iraq 
there should be differences is no 
surprise, and it would have been 
better if the author had remained 
on his first, more interesting theme. 

The problem is interesting 
indeed. One can begin to say that 
celebrities have fostered political 
causes for a long time, and on both 
sides of the political spectrum: 
Ronald Reagan was prorntlting 
right-wing politics long before he 
became a bona fide politician, and 
Charlton He ton is not afraid of 
putting his popularity at the ervice 
of the National Rifle Association . 

More importandy, in these days 
of mass culture, politicians are often 
ce.lebrities of their own, and it would 
be problematic to a Ic. a politician to 
stop talking politics simply because a 
lot of people recogruze his or her 
face on Tv. I would be happy to see 
the celebrity culture end and the 
advent of a more somber and rea-

soned way of doing politics, but this 
is mainly up to us. We should simply 
evaluate the positions that we hear at 
their face value and not give them 
special credit simply because they 
come from somebody we have seen 
on TV, be he Matthews or Reagan.

Students should pay 
more attention to war 

Editor: 
Isn't anyone concerned about 

war in Iraq? 
"It could be this week. It could be 

next. Both are active options," says 
VVhite House spokesman Ari 
Fleischer according to MSNBC 
news. How come these are not top 
headlines screaming from every tele-
vision station? War is such a big deal 
that even "Iron Cher' and "Friends" 
should be talking about what this 
means for the United tates. Simply 
to accept this war means we must 
accept the guaranteed con equences: 
death for AmeriC'Jns, death for our 
adversaries, death for innocent peo-
ple and huge economic upheaval 
(usually inflation). Americans were 
horrified at tile height of [he dea th 
toll ftom Sept. II ; should we not 
now preparc ourselves for the deaths 
to come? Does no one have anything 
to say? I am ab'1lillst thiS upcoming 

. war, but regardless. the day is com-
ing in which with or without tile 
United Nation' support, we will 
declare war on Iraq. Why isn't any-
one asking questions that need 
answering? 

Has America become so numb 
to death that we just accept th is nat-
ural result of war? Presidcnt Bush 
just proposed a tax cut plan. Where 
is the money coming from for this 
war? (fhe answer is that no matter 
how much we have, it will not 
finance this war.) Is anyone else 
concerned about the fact that 
America is prepared to defy the will 
of the United Nations to fight Iraq? 

Most U.S. students are aged 18 
to 25, and it will be us, our friends, 
who will fight this war. Not Bush 
from behind his desk, nor politi -
cians from behind their , I thanlc. 
the Guardian for its excellent cov-
erage of issues surrounding the war 
with Iraq, but I 'd li~c to go one 
step further. I propose that there 
be more publicity on campus con-
cerning war, be it in suppon or in 
protest. I also propose a page of 
the GUJlrdilm be dedicated to those 
who wish to send arguments/ques-
tions in support or protest of war 
with Iraq. Then the studenr body 
could ask and answer each other 's 
questions, debate opinions, discuss 
events - get involved. Put aside 
political parties; hawks, dove, are 
you prepared to accept the conse-
quences of war? Furthermore, as 
students attaining higher educa-
tion at a top state-funded universi-
ty, are you prepared for war?

Unlike 0 many of my peers 

(who seem all have masters in 
international rclations all of a sud-

Iraq, mostly because I've reali:r.ed

is true that ma ny schools have 
~LOpl'cd using dog labs, that fact is 
not cxactly indicative of vehement 
opposi tion. As professor of pharma-
co logy and med Icine Lawrence 
Brunton pointed out, the colleges 
may have opted out as a result 0 

incrca~ed pressure fro ll1 ani mal 
right~ groups, and not di rec tly frolll

all the hubhuh 'lIrround lng Ihe

seem that each li fe IS precious, It 
can also be saId that It i~ a rela tive-
ly small amount of an llm l expense

casses masquerading as s t yli~h

actions sheds a more positive light 
on the dog experimentation at 
UCS D, where they arc used to 
educa te rather than adorn. 

Dog owners of all stripes don 'l 
relish the fact that students at our 
~ch()o l slice open dogs for their 
education. But while dog lahs may 
not be the most pleasant thlllgs to

Under pressure frOIll animal 
rights organizations, srudents and 
conscienti ous physicians, medical 
schools have all but discontinued tile 
use of dog vivisection in labs. It is 

not unreasonable to hope tha t the 
UC D School of MediCine can fol-
low in the footsteps of eminent InStl-
ruo ns acro the country to discon-
ri nue dog labs - If only enough 
people will commit themsel ves to

... If no positive support IS recclved 
from UCS D adrninistrJ tlon (such as 
puni ng a stop to the KOIda), t11cn we 
as snldcnts of color will have to 
re talia te land thel ca mpus environ-
ment will be ho ri le the rcst of the 
year." Il is anger is understandable, 
but he ha, vlOlated any number of 
University regula ti ons by what 
appears to be threa terung violence If 
his demands were not met. This 
clearly Intimidated the university 
beClusc the Koak, was prosecll ted for 
allegcdly photographlllg ,\ larrine!. 
du ring a puhlic proceeding - also 
known as the practice of free 'peech 
- and proponents of such censor-
ship ,hould not hold an A . . office. 

Based upon this and the gram -
ma tica lly incorrect 300-word leiter 
he sent to the Koa lfl, it ca n be 
II1f.:rrctl that Martinez tends to 
allow his emotions to gC t the better 
of hi m and do ~ome th lng unadvI ~­
able. T he students do need ,O l11e-
one who wdl fight fo r studcnt 
right, - and 1artinc7. woul d cer-
ta lnl}' fi ght hard - but there i, 
undoubtedly a necessary I.:vel of

hardba ll , we as students will on ly 

lo~c If we ,Ire represented by sOllle-
one whose cl11otion; 111Igh t oyer-

sh:tdow his judgmcnt. 
\Nhen asked why Martinez was 

se lected, A.S . Pres ident J enn 
Brown said, "Erncsto was the only 
ca nd idate who had a plan to fill 
empty commi ttees and create a 
cohesive staff." 

T he other applica nts, however. 
disagree. 

"It' absol utely fabe," Fellcr 
said. " I know fo r fact that aro and 
I both had plans to fi ll tho c com-
mi nee ; that was one of our kcy 
conccrns fo r qui te a while ." 

Feller said he told Brown that 
hiS pl al\ would be "to fi nd Out who 
ap pl ied to thc office las l ummcr, 
becau,e I Iall e dldn't appOint every-
body that applied. The second half 
of tha t is [0 reopen the application 
period for a week. The advertising 
would mai nly come through Ihe 
Gllt/rd,an and through A.S. posters, 
ba nn ers, student councils and RAs 
whu can tell thei r residents." 

Bo urnoutia n was e.quJlly 
appalled by Brown's statement. li e 
said hiS plan wa to "genera te J lot 
more publicity. advertl e on shuttle 
marquees, place posters all ovcr 
CJ mp us and lo bby the co ll ege

TI IE U D GUARDIAN MONDAY. FEBRUARY 24 , ZOO) 

Pint: Bartenders don't mind the smoke 
continued from page 5 

Though this social attitude has 
not reached Ireland, the legaJ ani -
tude has. With ad campaigns to 
stop moking, the government 
thinks that people will actually 
top. In America, everyone laughs 

at rhe U.S. urgeon General's 
warnings on the cigarette packs, 
but in Ireland, the warnings are 
legally required to be large 
enough to cover hal f the pack, and 
they say, in big bold letters , 
"Smoking Kills", or even, 
"Smoking Causes Erectil e 
Dysfunclion." With this measure 
to ban moking from pubs and 
bars, they are hoping to put a final 
stab Into Ihe heart of the smoking 
commu nity, that IS, the only place 
smokers are allowed to congre-
ga te indoors. 

I have been surpri ed to find 
tha t no one seems to be 
alarmed. The general consensus is 
that tt is a horrible thing to do 10 
tradttion, but no one really wants 
to lift a finger to say otherwi e. In 
fact, most of the Irish smoking 
population does not think thaI 
anything WIll be done to enforce 
the ri gi d ba ns. 

This rcason1l1g is certainly jus-
tified. "1any safety rul es are 
already Ignored. Most preva lent 

of these would be the mandatory 
closing times for all public houses. 
As ir stands, pubs mu t clo e at 
11 :30 p.m. on the weekdays and 
midnight on the weekends. In 
Dublin, Cork, and some parts of 
Limerick and Galway, these rules 
are indeed enforced by the 
patrolling Gardai. However, these 
parts of the cities comprise very 
little area and business compared 
to rural pubs, which stand as bea-
con of social activity in rhe coun-
tryside. These pubs, dependent 
on their drunken revellers, must 
stay open as long as drinks are 
bought in order to stay in busi -
ness. Understandably, the Gardal 
does not have time to patrol the 
old, bumpy roads around Irela nd 
trying lO fine and shut down every 
establishment open after 11 .30 
p.m. 

In the same sense, 11105t lri ~ h 
drinkers/smokers do not hcli c\'c 
that a new, health -conscious gov-
ernment is going to stop lheltt 
from doing what they have been 
doing their whole lives. They 
know perfectly well what smoking 
will do. The)' should be more 
worried about what they will be 
doing to themselves after a few 
more pints. And si nce the Irtsh 
have a way of beltlg somehow 

optimistically cynical, it has been 
sa id th3t the government wouldn't 
possibly take "our only comfort 
away." 

As for the elhics of antislnok-
ing laws, they come from the 
understandable reasoning that 
smoking ca n cause cancer in 
those around you, including 
yourself. However, no one ever 
forces anyone to go to a pub. 
Additionally, the vast majonty of 
bartenders arc either smokers 
them elves or do not care if they 
are imme rsed in Ihe smoke 
cloud, bccause that 's what they 
would be doing If they wercn't 
working. 

Perhaps this i~ the be,t form of 
protest: ignoring the Ltws alto-
gether. If no one ellforces It, nmh-
1I1g will happen . 

Looki ng ag.lln at the smoke 
cloud in Colcraine, pcrhap' the 

orlh won't be the [.1't b,,,tion 
for smoking in J soclJI ~ettillg. 
Pcrhap, Ireland \1111 ncver opt tiJr 
the "healthy" change" and dlallg-
ing is cxactly whJt Irela nd docsn't 
w.lt1l.

Swamp life: Wildlife thrives at the Kendall·Frost marsh, which encourages ViSitorS 
to take the opportunity to gain hands-on expenence at Its open house. 

Marsh: Mission Bay swamp 
invites community to learn 

continued from page 13 
in 1965 in response to escalating 
destruction to wildlife field site in 
California . The accelerating devel-
opment and population left few 
sites safe from urban disruption, 
leaving much of Californi a's land-
capes unusable for ecosystem 

rc earch. The RS was thus estab-
lished to preserve and protect nat-
ural areas, as well as to increase 
understanding of the earth and its 
natural systems. The NRS is now 
the largest university-operated sys-
tem of natural reserves in the 
world. 

The va rious CSD-matntained 
resen'es have served as an outdoor 
laboratory and classroom for 
researchers to obtai n a better 
understanding of ecological prinCI -
ples, as well as 10 observe the 
Impact contaminating human 
expansion has on nalUral ecos)'s-

tems. The Kendall-Frost marsh has 
supported many doctoral disserta-
tions and long-term research by 
sUidents and faculty. 

"One of the main reasons for 
the marsh IS for studelH to come 
and volunteer or do research," 
Spiller sa id. 

Kay furthermore explicated the 
importance of the mar ' h as a "good 
benchmark for comparing other 
lagoons." 

\\lith the Kcmbll -Frost l1larsh 
open house, the UC D NRS will 

~eek to encoumge quahfictl 
research and wtll enlist commul1lty 
support for one of the last relllam-

Nights" will help them gain a 
greater understanding and apprecia-

What do you think about the anti ... war protests? 

Events slich as "Deaf Nights" 
have allowed the community to 
both carry on its language and cul-
ture and share them with others. 
Despite efforts to integrate deaf 
Americans into speaking culnlre, 
they remain a distinct group with 
hared unity and thei r own culture, 

values and tradiuons, of which they 
take great pride. Deaf Identity will 
never be fully understood or 
acquired by hearing individuals 
becau e they will not have had the 
experience of living without the

Softball moves into a 
tie for third in division 

UCSD i swept by APU before 
sweeping CSUB to move to third 

By JOE SPANO 
Staff Writer 

UC D softball got off to a slow 
start this weekend, losing both 
games of its first doubleheader to 
Azusa Pacific 3-2 on Feb. 21, but 
returned to form, winning both 
games in its second doubleheader 
against CSU San Bernardino 3- 1 
and 10-5 respecitively on Feb 22. 

The Tritons kept it close all 
along in the first game against Azusa, 
with each team scoring a run in the 
first inning. TIle Cougars added a 
run in the fourth, which UCSD 
answered with a run of its own in the 
sixth, bringing the 

" 

first start of the season. 
The Tritons offense came in 

one fell swoop when senior Kri tin 
I Iunstad's triple scored Mcnee and 
McCue in the fifth inning. UCSD 
continued to leave runners on base, 
though, strand ing 12 runners in the 
course of the doubleheader. 

However, the Tritons were able 
to turn it all around on Feb. 22 
against San Bernardino, starting 
with a 3- 1 victory behind Kurz's 
first win of the year. The Coyotes 
took an ea rly lead in the second 
inning, but UC D was able to 
come back in the fifth and take the 
lead and the win. 

"Steph anie has 
score to 2 -2 and 
keeping it there 
until the eighth 
i nning. Azusa was 
able to score the 
game-winning run 
in the bottom of the 
eighth, glvmg 
UCSD sophomore 
Keri Hanley the 10 s 
to put her record at 
3 -4 on the season. 
The Tritons com-
mitted two errors, 
resulting in rwo 
llnea rned rW1S. 

We came from 
behind in both games 
to get the win, and 1 

think that says a 
lot." 

defiantly made her 
way into the pitch-
ing rotation," 
Gerckens said . 
" he pitched awe-
some this week-
end, and it's really 
excitll1g to know 
we ca n add her to 
our pitching suff." 

The offense 
exploded for the 
Ti-itons in the sec-
ond game when 
they s ored 10 runs, 

- Patti Gerckens, UCSD 
head coach 

"The defense JUSt broke down 
for us in both games," said UCSD 
head coach Pani Gerckens. "When 
you 10 e, defense is the reason; 
defense wms and loses games for 
you. \\le didn't play poorly, they 
ju~t capita li zed on our mistakes." 

The offense wa there for 
UC D , however, provided in part 
by )Ul1lor Amy ,v l enee, who went 1-
for-l WIth a nUl and an RBI, as well 
as junior Kim Aggahao, who went 2-
for-·t Sophomore lieko M cCue 
and freshman Jenny Spencer added 
an RBI and a run, respecti\'ely. 

The second game for the 
Tmon netted the same results : 3 
3 -2 defeat. Both C D and zu a 
scored two runs 111 the fifth, but the 
'ougar crossed the plate once 

more in the seventh, giving the loss 
ro freshman Stephanie Kurz in her 

seven of which 
came in the second inning. Menee 
and Aggabao continued to perform 
strong at the plate with Mettee hit-
ting an RBI triple and later coring, 
while Aggabao netted three RBIs on 
the series. 

"We cam e from behind in both 
games [again t San Bernardino] to 
get thc win, and I think that say a 
lot," Gerckcns said. 

With these wins, UCSD 
improve its overall record to 9-6 
and ItS Califorl1l3 Collegiate 
Athletic Associauon record ro 5-3, 
putting the ' rj-irons in a lie for third 
place with CSU Domll1gucz I "II 
and C U Bakersfield. 

On Feb. 28, UCSD will host 
Chico Sl:tte, which went to the 
regional playoffs la t year, and on 
March I, the Tritons will host first-
place UC Davis.

Lanthier takes a new approach 
Men's basketball loses, but team closes the gap 

By AMBER MARTIN 
Staff Writer 

UCSD men'~ l>a~ketball head 
coach Greg Lanthier approached 
thi weekend's road triPS agail15t 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association 's top rwo teams with 
the goal of "closing the gap from 
the last time we played them." The 
1riton's returned to Sa n Diego at 
the end of the weekend with losses 
to both Cal Poly Pomona and 
CSU San Bernard ino; however, 
the team accomplished its goal and 
was more competitive with both 
teams. 

Feb. 2 I proved to be a defen-
sive matchup in Pomona, Calif., 
leading to the low final score of 
57 -4 I. Pomona contained the 
Tritons all evening and was able 
to come out with the win. 

In the fi rst eight minutes, 
Pomona tOok off on a 24-5 run, 
giving it an eventual 12-point lead 
at hal f time. The game was not 

over, however, and the 1ri tons 
came out in the ~econd half With 
an 18-8 run, clo ing the gap to 
just two at 40-38 With 10 minutes 
to go in the game. Pomona took 
over at that pomt With II straight 
pom ts to lead the rest of the 
game. 

Jordan Watkins lead U SD in 
scoring with 10 points and eight 
rebounds on the evening. Ryan 
Rikansrud followed with nine 
points. 

Pomona's defense prevented 
any breakout scorers from the 
UCSD team, holding the Tritons ' 
shooting percentage below 30. 

On Feb. 22 in San Bernardino, 
Calif., the home team took off on 
a 39-22 lead in the first half, a 
deficit the Tritons could never 
overcome. 

In the second half, however, 
the Tritons came out with 
Lanthier's goal, "A nothing-to-
lose attitude," and stayed within 
three on the hal f. The 49-46 sec-

ond half, however, lead to J 20-
point loss of 88-68 to San 
Bernardmo. 

Even in the loss, the offeme 
Improved from Fen. 21, lealling to 
a h igher team score Jild a 7 per-
cent improvement 111 shoollng. 

i'v1 atthew Sween)' lead t he 
team with 17 pOll1 t~ and five 
rebound s. lie was 6-for- 13 trom 
the field on the evening, makmg 
three shots from behind th e 
three-pOI nt arc. 

Matthew Conti also aided the 
Tritons off the bench With I ~ 
points and seven rebounds. 

Freshman 2ach Zanolli fol-
lowed with eight points. In just 
seven minutes of playmg time, he 
was 2 - for-3 from the noor and 
made two free throws . 

I ext weekend, the Tnrons go 
on the road for (he last time to 
face UC Davis and Chico State 
before returning for their last et 
of home games at RllvlAC Arena 
March 7 and March 8. 

Volleyball: Coach can't light needed spark 
continued from page I 

able to take a 30-27 victory. 
in the second game, UC D 

stayed reasonably close, but was 
unable to take control of the match. 
With his team starting to slip late in 
the game, Triton head coach Ron 
Larsen tOok a timeout and 
implored his team to fight harder. 

" I was trying to get in their 
faces a little and talk to them 
about their manhood and about 
getting after it and not wilong ... 
and not being like a little girl and 
backrng off," Larsen said_ 

The ploy did not work, how-
ever, and UCSD fell 3D-l·t 

In what amounted to little more 
than a formality, the more confi -
dent side ea tly took the third game 
30-20 for a three-game ~weep. 

Perrine once again led the 
Tritons with 13 kills, Jim Waller 
added II and T.J . Young tallied 
eight coming off the bench. 
Thoreson and Joe Griffin com-
bined for 38 assl ts while splitting 
the sening duty. Andy Rupp led 

the Tritons with five block assists. 
The aggravation of losing 

began to visibly reveal its effects 
during the loss. 

"I thought tonight was where I 
could really see it Out on the 
court, and the frustration was real 
evident. It was tOO emotional, and 
some people just needed to back 
off," Lar en said. 

The fru stration carn ed 
beyond the court, and an attitude 
adjustment appears necessarily if 
UCSD retams hope for the sec-
ond half of the season. 

" It's kll1d of like our whole 
team is getting used to losing, 
which is bullshit because we soli 
have half a sea~on Icft," Young 
said. "1 heard some negative com-
ments m the room 111 the meeting 
today. It' kind of a bummer com -
mg from our top players." 

The Tritons WIll t'lke their first 
steps toward o "ereoming a fruit-
less fir t half against :-.Jo. 7-ranhd 
Long Beach State at RIMAC 
Arena on Feb. 26.

Although the 13 th-ranked

Men's tennis: Tritons have 
little trouble over weekend 

conrinued [rom page ~o 
Doug I Iofi113nn and Erik Oijala, 
who finished with a score of 8- I. 

"The fir t match was easy for us, 
and we played very well and gave a 
good effort," said Triton head 
coach Enc Steidlmaycr. 

In singIc, UCSD once again 
domi nated and was clearly "in the 
zone" according to \Vilson, who 
saded through his slllgle~ match 6-1, 
6-3. The Tritons con tinucd 10 wipc 
Out thc opposition with victorics by 
Nagel (6-0, 6- I), I lofmann (6- I, 6-
I), Oijala (6- 1,6-2), ' lomas Novak 
(6-3,6- 1) and i\lorton (6- 1, 6-1). 

UCSD next faccd off against 
cross-town rivals AlIiant 
lnternational and was VictoriOUS 111 
yet another one-sided victory at 8-1. 

The Tritons swept doublcs when 
the pairings of Sameer Chopra and 
Bryan Swan, \Vils n and Morton, 
and Tomas ovak and agel easrl y 
won against AJU with scores of - I, 
8-2 and 8-0, respectively. 

T he only 10 s came in si nglcs 
when Meyer fought hard in a tough 
match and was barely cdged out 6-
4,6-3. UC D wrapped up the vic-
tory With singles wins by Emil 
Novak (6- 1, 6-0), Blake "\~ Ison­

The Tritons hit the road alld

Broncos 7-2. 

Although the team dropped only 
two matches, there are some ques-
tion that necd to he addressed. It 
was not one of U SO 's bctter 
matches, according to teidlmayer. 

"We have to have a hctter collec-
