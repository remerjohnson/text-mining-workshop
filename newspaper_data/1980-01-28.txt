Plan Asks 
4th Week 
Drop Date 

The Academic Senate will 
hear a proposal by its 
Committee on Educational 
Policy tomorrow which wiD 
make it possible to drop 
c1alleS later in the quarter, but 
will penalize the student who 
does 10. 

The new add.drop policy, 
which CEP chair Tom Bond 
s~s will let transcripts "more 
accurately reflect a student's 
abitity," moves the drop. 
without· penalty date to the 
fourth week. 

Students could also drop 
dasses throuf: the ninth 
week, but a 'W" would be 
placed next to that c1aas on the 
transcript. That ''W'', for 
"withdrawl," would not figure 
in grade point average. 

The change in policy would 
also allow students to 
withdraw from the university 
lUltii the ninth week. 

Students would be allowed 
to repeat daases for which 
they received a W. 

The proposal must be 
submitted to the Assembly of 
the Academic Senate for 
approval, 10 the earliest the 
changes could take effect is 
Fall, 198Q. 

Bond has argued that the 
present system, which allows 
drops without penalty through 
the sixth week, will help 
prevent waated lab space and 
dusroom time by encourag· 
ing Iludents to drop earlier. 

The Senate will allO receive 
the report of the Committee on 
Academic Personnel, which 
helps make tenure decisions. 

The committee's major 
point is that of 75 1978-79 
tenure decisions, four were 
overruled by the administra· 
tion (ultimately, Vice 
Chancellor Paul Salman), all 
to giveprofealOrs tenure over 
a netative CAP vote. '

Cuts Seen 
. Even if,N'o 
Jarvis II 
Fees to Soar: 
Then What? 

By Carolyn Friday 
Sacramento CorTespondent 

Financial aid shortages and 
huge increases in fees are in 
UC's future, a report by the 
California Post·Secondary 
Education Committee says, 
and that's even before 
considering the possible 
impact of Jarvis II , the June 
tax-cutting initiative. 

Released' last week after 18 
months in the making, the 
report was not designed to 
measure fee increases of the 
magnitude now being 
discussed as a result of Jarvis 
II, but its appearance at this 
point is timely. 

The governor has asked all 
public agencies to prepare 
budgets for 1980-81 showing 
30 percent worth of cutbacks. 

Perhaps the trickiest 
~blem UC and other public 
.. her education segments 
have ever faced, administra· 
tors must somehow determine 
the optimum point at which 
fees can be railed to ,enerate 
revenue with minimum 10 .. of 
enrollment. 

The issue is further 
complicated by the fact that 
higher fees will necessitate. 
tremendous student aid 
increases. 

Traditionally, this aid has 
come from the university's 
own education fee, the Cal 
Grant program, and federal 
programs. 

But the federal Basic 
Education Opportunity Grants 
are not cost·responsive, which 
means 43 percent of UC's 
students currently receiving 
BEOG grants will not be 
eligible for any more money 
regardless of how steep the 
fees go, according to Kate 
Jeffrey, UC financial aid 
policy analyst. 

And HEW has cut back 
slightly on BEOG for 1980-
81. 

The Cal Grants, which 
would respond to the increase, 
currently allocate only 15.1 % 
of their funds to UC students. 
61.4 % goes to independent 
college students . at Stanford 
and Cal Tech, for example. 

Without even considering 
the 11 percent expansion 
required to meet needs of 
current UC recipients, (not to

Angela Davis Questioned, Phelps Defended -
Editor: 

-In response to the aevere 
criticism of Dave · Phelp.' 
Jan. 18 letter: I would like to 
say a few word. about these 
people's harsh remarks, 
especially thoae of Susan 

I 
Fogel. 

If she sincerely believes 
that her ideas of Davis are 
right, there is no way should 
she condemn just one man, 
but instead put the blame on 
our entire system as Martin 
Luther King would have. 

However, is she in the 
right? Are you sure that 
Davis does not advocate 
violence? Don) you recall 
her violent nihilistic attitude 
in the late 1960's and early 
1970's? If Davis did not 
espouse violence, then why 
did she set up a defense fund 
for the convicted Soledad 
brothers, who in 1970 wer~ 
involved in the Marin County 
shootout? Was she not alto 
sought for kidnapping., 
conspiracy to commit 
murder and other charges. 
Didn't .he allO go into hiding 
from the law to avoid thele 
charges: 

She was acquitted in 1971 
on aU count •. But doesn't all 
this entail violence? 

Perhaps the mo.t 
disturbing 'part to me in 
Fogel'. letter was her 

statement, "And it is whites 
like Phelps which cauae me 
to be so ashamed of my race 
at time •. " A~rently .he 
does nOt know PhdPI, but I 
do. I've known Dave for a 

Ion~ time and I'm damn l{Iad 

he i. on my side. He is- the 
hardest working individual 
that I have ever met, he'. Ofl1!! 
of the most kind-hearted 
people that I've known, and 
he has always strived to ~p 
his fellow man. I'm sorry that 

Susan feels the way she does 
about Dave, becauae it is her 
1011 for not knowing him. I 
wish that there were many 
more outstanding individuals • 
like Dave Phelps . . 

KEVIN ELLIOIT 

Don't Just Attack Communism, But 
Ask Why Davis, Others Have Joined 
Editor: 

The misguided and confused David W. 
Phelps did a disservice to UCSD and Angela 
Davis with hill nasty letter published the day of 
her speech here (Jan 18). His attack showed 
that he does not know enough about Davis. 

. Should we bar all members 
of the Democratic and 
Republican parties? 
Martin'Luther King or American history. . 

To red-bait someone in King's name il the 
ultimate irony. King himself was the target of 
numerQUs red-baiting a .. ault. during hil life, 
some onginating from the all·Amerir~;; FBI 
itself. 

Davis has done .ome .l0od work, 
particularly here at UCSD. The Third College 
plan she helped formulate would have gone a 
long way toward establishing a place .tudenta 
could get the kind of information needed to aet 
about implementing Martin Luther King'l 
goal •. Judge her by her action., not her political 
betiefs. 

To castigate all member of the Communi.t 
- Party and call them un-American i. idiotic. To 

be communist is not necessarily to be un-
American (and to be fervently patriotic is not 
necessarily to be pro-American, in the sense of 
upholding the principles a King stood for). 
Despite the many grievous errors of the US 
Communist Party, the fact is that many 
Americans have joined it at one time or 
another·-~t out of loyalty to Moscow but out 01 
a desire to build a inore equitable society. Many 
black people have been among them, includi"l 
Kinj'. forebearer- in the ciYil rights movement, 
W.E.B.OuBois. Rather than assail Davil and 
anyone ever aslOciated with the party, Phelps 
should ask what it i. about thi. society that 
cauael intelligent, aenaitive people like DuBoia 
and Davis to decide that Communism il the 
be.t cure for it. 

As for the diatribe over Afghanistan. IhouId 
we apply Phelps' logic to OU{.eaves and, in light 
of the decimation of Viebnan by America 
forces. ban all members of the Democratic and 
Republica.n parties?

FBI "Expands Probe 
Of College Basketball 

SAN DIEGO - The FBI hu reportedly widened ita 
gambling and mail fraud probe of college balketball to some 
teams in the Western Athletic conference and the University of 
Southern California. . 

The San Diego Union, citing a variety of "reliable lOurces," 
also said Saturday that law enforcement officials anticipate a 
perjury indictment of University of New Mexico president 
William E. Davis, unless Davis recants his testimony before a 
federal grand jury . 

The testimony concerned allegations that basketbasll player 
Larry Belin continued to practice with his team after losing his 
eligibility, and that Davis was aware of what was going on . 

The paper arso said Bill Byrne, the new assiatant athletic 
director at San Diego State University, has been subpoenaed to 
answer questions regarding fraudulent atheltic credits there. 

Byrne came to San Diego after- resigning as president of the 
Lobo Club, UNM's booster organization, which is being 
investigated by another grand jury for hidden funds allegedly 
used to subsidize athletes. 

The complex probe began when law enforcement agencies 
discovered a sophisticated gambling operation in the 
Albuquerque area had used a computer at the plant of a 
government defenae contractor. 

Authorities .aid a wiretap then produced evidence that UNM 
basketball coach Norm fJlenburger and his assistant Manny 
Goldstein had conspired to pay $300 for a fraudulent transcript 
that would keep basketball player Crait Gilbert elilible. 

Ellenburger wu subsequently fired, Goldstein resigned and 
Gilbert wu declared ineligible. 

Quoting "reliable law enforcment 1OUfCeI," the Union said the 
probe was broadened to include the Univenity of Southern 
California. . 

The paper quoted another "reliable source in Lo. Angeles," 
~s lar,ing "the FBI hal been on campus there at USC for lOI11e 
lime. 

The FBI in Loa Angeles declined to confinn that, the paper 
said. 

The Union said it also learned that former San Diego State 
basketball coach Tim Vezie, had been interviewed by the FBI. 
He was reportedly asked about possible point .having by UNM 
in a game with San Diego. 

A National Collegiate Athletic Association spokesman said 
NCAA policy forbids discussion of invertigations in progress, 
but that academic violations take top priority over other 
allej(ations.

lCored just eight points in the first 10 

. rniIatteI. At times it was difficult to lee the 
court around rampant rolls of toilet paper, 
unlealhed balloonl and springing 
cheerIeacIerl. 

When the court occasionally came into 
view, total Triton dominance was visible. 
Whittier never led in the game, and in the 
eeconcl half they never got closer than lix 
points. 

Sl.man JohnllOn and Gary Haynes 
contributed the best periormances of thei, 
career. Johnson led UCSD with 23 points 
and nine rebounds; Haynes put in 18 
.... 1ionaI points. Stan Hopper came 
clown with eilht Caroml, and Dana 
BeUrd .dc1ec121 more points. 

An emoholl.'! zenith in the game came 
five min,,'.. lilt , ) the second half with a 
slam dunk 'w J ,lhn80n. The crowd was 
delighl"11 . . 'n after a technical foul was 
award, II 1:"1 ". abbing the rim. 

Johnson was pleased with his and the 
team's performance. "We should have a 
crowd like this every game. I loved every 
minute of it," he said. 

Coach Ron Carter was equally ecstatic. 
"We won this game mainly because of 

the crowd. It makes a big difference when 
you're playing a good team, and Whittier 
ilone of the beatteaml we've faced so far. 

"I guarantee that if we continue to get 
this kind of support, we'll go undefeated in 
our gym for the rest of the season." 

The mad house a,tmosphere put 
Whittier at a disadvantage as much as it 
helped UCSD The abundant home team 
spirit made the visitors jumpy and 
unnerved. They were down 48·33 at the 
half, and 36 fouls were whiltled against 
them, induding two technicals, compared 
to only 25 against UCSD.

Tritons Beat Pros -
Unt~1 Eighth Inn~ng 

By Tim Liotta 
Senior Staff W riler . 

Benefit baseball games usually see two teams take the field 
and down around the rest of the afternoon in a boring game. 
Saturday, however, UCSD's benefit game against a team of 
local pros was not only played to win, it had the excitement 
any hard.fought baseball game would. . 

The UCSD Tritons lost a tough 6·3 decision on a four·run 
rally by the pros in the eighth inning. The Tritons looked 
extremely sharp prompting coach Vince Askey to call their 
Pay "a great all around performance." 

UCSD Led Coing into The 8th, 
When The Roof FellIn And The Pro 
Team Won, 6-3 

The Tritons scored first in the bottom of the third when Jim 
Moffatt, Eric Zimmer and Dean Scarafo~ singled 
consecutively off of Montreal Expo Randy Maler. The 
Tritons looked ~ke they would've had more when Pat 
McGovern whistled a line drive, a sure hit, only to have Padre 
Tom Jones snag it and catch Zimmer off of third for a double 
play. 

Tom Nichobon and Jgfm Kozik each pitched two hitlets 
innings for the Tritons, both fine performances this early in the 
season. Bob Allen, a converted first baseman, a1110 looked . 
tough, though he gave up the pros' first run. It was his first 
appearance in actual game conditions, but he looked /quite at 
home on the mound. . 

"Bob is real smooth out there," said Coach Askey, "all he 
needs is experience. I'm sure he's going to help us this year." 

The brightest sport in the Triton lineup came in the ninth 
batting position in second baseman Dean Scarafoni. 
Scarafoni went two for two, knocked in the Tritons' first't'Un 
and had five assists in the field. 

"Dean played outstanding today," said Askey, "he hit the 
ball well, was great in the field. He did it all." 

Scarafoni, however, considered the game as only one in a 
season. He won the starting spot at second base narrowly 
over Monti Parrino and Bob Quiel this winter and knows 
those two will be ready to jump in at any moment. 

"I still have to keep hitting," said Scarafoni after the game. 
"I'd ~ke to hit .300 this year." 

Askey was ecstatic over the turnout of well over 100 fans 
·for the game, one of many bright spots. 

"The fans were sensational. We really appreciate their 
suppOrt," said Askey. 

Brett Sandstrom made the defensive play of the day on a 
I shoestri!!8, diving catch on a sinking line drive in the seventh 

inning. The Tritons were sharp in the field, (which itself has 
lOme work needed before it will be ready for regular season 
pm10· . 

The Athletic Department "really carne through for us" 
added Aakey, when they had the IOrely needed backstop 
coIIIIructed tIU past week. Dirt is expected to be laid down 
next week as the finiIhing touches wiD be made. 

Askey IUII1med up the TrikJn'l high·spirited, enthusiastic 
attitude with confidence. 

''We're ready to go."

Meet Was Not as One-Sided As Score 
By Jon Goetz 
Sports Editor 

Joe Hernandez and Lance Halsted rewarded 
a small home crowd with victories Friday ~ a 
frustrating meet that saw UCSD swimmers 
place strongly, but repeatedly fall short of the 
win. 

San Oiego State won 10 of the 12 events at 
the natatorium that night in a 70·33 victory. 
The UCSD swimmers never placed lower that 
third. often swam their season's best times, yet 
were overpowered consistently. 

Stal, coach Bill Morgan argues that if the • 
diving competition were thrown out (SDSU 
won uncontested) and the relay relmlts were 
switched (SDSU narrowly won both), then the 
meet would have looked very dose. 

In any case, a handful of races indicated that 
the growing strength of UCSD lwimming may 
make this meet the beginning of an exciting 
croll·town rivalry. 

The 1000 free race, often a tediOUI event to 
watch, instead gave the crowd the mOlt~:!!!~_ 

race of the seallOn. 
Halsted and Roger Kurtin trailed the leading 

Aztec swimmer for the ~rst three-quarters of the 
race. Then Halsted began narrowing the gap, 
which was originally half of a pool length. 

No more than 50 UCSD lpectatorl were on 
hand for the race, but they were all screaming 
as Halsted stole the lead after 33 lengths, then 
left the rest of the field behipd in hil wake. 

"The crowd helped a lot," he said after the 
race. " I was in a lot of pain." But he kept up hil 
pace and finished in 10:00.9, easily breaking 
his old school record of 10:03.4. 

The pandemonium of the echoing 
natatorium and the pre·meet mental psyching 
gave Halsted the perfect conditions for a race. 

". think this was a good kind of race fOl' doing 
it (setting the record)." Hi, time i, 20 seconds 
better than at this time Ialt year. 

Joe Hernandez received the next·loude.t 
applause when he led the 1 ()() free the whole 
race, and came in for a 48.4 victory. Thia was

Aztecs Clobber Men in V -8all 
By Scott Allison 

The men's volleyball team 
suffered its second loss of the 
season in the main gym Friday 
night when the strong San 
Diego State team defeated the 
T ntons, three games to one. 

The Aztecs, currently 
ranked fourth in the nation, 
dominated play from the 
onset. Only a fine eHort from 
UCSD in the third game 
prevented San Diego State 
from repeating lalt· year's 

three game sweep of the 
Tritons. 

Coach Doug Dannevik, 
usually the etemaJ optimist , 
was concerned about his 
squad's play after the game 
and said he wants to amend 
the Triton's poor serving, 
which has plagued them all 
year. 

". don't know if our inability 
to serve is a mental or a 
physical thing , " said 
DalUlJ!vik. "I think the guys 

sometimes lose their 
competitive attitude out there. 
We're just not executing." 

Apparently even proper 
execution would ha ve been 
sufficient against San Diego 
State . The cress· town rivals 
are in NCAA Division I, and 
are stocked with recruiting 
rights and other talent· 
producing privileges. The 
Aztecs could give UCLA a 
run for the National

Another dOle race came in 
the 200 individual medley, 
though UCSD didn't finiah on 
top in this one. Mark Allen 
.tarted the race off in third

moved to second alter the 
backstroke, then took the lead

Coach Morgan, celebrating 
his birthday at the meet, had a 
few surprise. coming to him. 
Steve Beat missed a nationally 
qualifying time in the 200 
·breast by leu than half of a 
second, finishing six or eight 
seconds faster than Morgan 
thought he would. And the 
medley relay swam UCSD's 
second fastest time ever, wh~e 
the free relay finished in the 
school', top three times. 

He was somewhat angry 
that people here would just 
consider the meet as a loss. 
"State's good - people don't 
realize that," he said. 

"I think too many put too 
much importance on the meet 
and not just on doing good 
time.. The administrators 
come up to me and ask me 
how we're going to do against 
State and then their 

philosophy . is the joy o( 
competition and education. It 
seems to me there's a conflict 
in philosophy."

Spikers Whipped 
By Tough Aztecs 

Continued f,om patlfl 5 
Championship this year. 

In the first game, the visitors 
romped to a 15-4 vielory. The 
second game ended with 
UCSD on the short end of a 
respectable 15·11 score. 

The third t{ame finally gave 
the crowd something to cheer 
about. Playing against the 
Aztec's second string, the 
Tritons were victorious, 15-
13. 

But San Diego State's 
coach took no chances and put 
hi. (irst team back in for the 
final game, which they easily 
won, 15-6. 

Despite two losses last 
week, the Triton season 
remains promising. 

"We weren't supposed to 
beat either of those teams," 

said assistant Coach Mitch 
Kobara. "Yet we "ave them 
both a good game. ' 

Future T rilon successes 
may depend on whether the 
team's serving improves. 
UCSD has been outserved by 
every opponent this year.

In Fees, Aid Cuts 
Even Without Jarvis II 
Continued (rom pafle 1 
mention new needy recipient.) 
bued on a theoretical $1,000 
tuition increue, the pI"OIram 
also faces the same 30 percent 
reduction u all other state 
agenciN. 

UC admini.traton must 
therefore coruider funneling at 
Ieut some of the tuition· 
..... ated revenue into added 
financial aid. 

Yet another consideration if 
the 10.. of .tate funds due to 
declining enrollment. The 
Dept. of rlOance'. p!esent 
formula call. for $2,964 
sub.icly per UC .tudent. 

The State University 
System has reque.ted 
limulation .tudies ba.ed on 
CPEC' • .model. 

The model only evaluated 
the effect. of enroUment of 
S 1 00 tuition increaaN for the 
community college., .tate 
colleges, and UC. 

"While CPEC'. report i. the 
beat one done on this problem, 
it .tiIl fall. .hort of the 
information we really need to 
live an informed deci.ion on 
.tion," said UC associate 
buchret director Jesse Shaw. 

While UC may also a.k 
CPEC to run lOme revenue 
fitures through the model, it 
.. some serious concern. 
.Lout the facton than went 
into the .tudy, according to 
Shaw. 

CPEC hu taken .everal 
tuition e1aaticity .tudies done 
at different times across the 

nation and applied them to 
.egments in California. 
Because of California'. unique 
and expen.ive public 
education, many feel this is 
inappropriate to California to 
apply re.ult. taken from 
in.titution. where students are 
already accustomed to paying 
tuition. 

According to Jeffrey, the 
UC has a disproportionate 
share of students with both 
high ability and high income 
compared to the institutions 
acro.s the nation. She feels the 
proposed overall enrollment 
decline of 1.42 percent, based 
on a $100 increase in fees 
determined by the CPEC 
report, is questionable. 

"The $100 represents such 
a small proportionate increase 
for UC students," she said. 

Another major drawback of 
the .tudy, Jeffrey believes, is 
that it does not take into 
account the psychological 
effects on prospective 
applicants, who may not be 
aware of the availability of 
financial aid aDd may 
therefore be discouraged from 
even applying to the 
university. Neither does the 
study measure incentive, 
which could drop sharply for 
the minorities ill particular, if it 
suddenly became much harder 
to pay for education, 
according to Dave Shontz, co· 
director of the student lobby 
(UC).

Workshop Helps Women Who 
Have Trouble Reaching OrgasDl 
Contirured (rom paRe 1 

Men can benefit from the \Vorkahop as well, 
Olkin believes: "Women differ radicaUy as to 
the nature, manner of stimulation and 
frequency of orgasm. The poor guys are 
expeeled to know everything there is to know 
- about all women." 

"There is a curious reversal of male and 
female roles when it comes to sex," Olkin 
explains. "Women are ordinarily expected to 
be more emotionally expressive lban are men, 
but women are taught to be sexually passive, 
to suppress their sexual feelings. 

"Too many women are convinced that sex 
is just for "him" and that they shouldn't expect 
much pleasure. 

"This attitude is wrong," asserts Olkin. 

"Women should be able to feel comfortable 
with askirlg for what they want without fear of 
damaging the male ego." 

According to Olkin, workshops that help 
women appreciate sexual orgasm are 
typically very successful - usually an 80 
percent success rate, she says and sometimes, 
as at UCSB, 100 percent, based on subjective 
evaluation. 

OIkin received her trainiryc in 'pre. 
orgasmic" therapy from UCSB, working with 
Lonnie Barbach, sex researcher and author of 
For Yourself - The Fulfillment of Female 
Sexuality. 

For further information on the "pre. 
orgasmic" workshop, call Rhoda Olkin at
