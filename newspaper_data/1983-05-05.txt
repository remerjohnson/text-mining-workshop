Spring Fling Praised 
Editor: 

This letter IS m regard to 
Campus Recreation's "Spring 
Fling" to Mazatlan. The trip 
was a lot of fun and a great 
wa\, to relax after finals. It 
con'sisted of transportation to 
and from Mazatlan , and hotel 
accomodat ions at the EI Cid, a 
resort right on the beach. The 
hotel had three swimmmg 
pools. including one With a 
sWim up bar, tennis court', 
and many different re~taur· 
ants. 

Mexican discos, where man\' 
would ta) until the early 
morn mg. 

Letters to the Editor 
The days were spent SIll 109 

on the beach, relaxing and 
enjoying the warm Mexican 
sU:1shme. We also were '1ble to 
rent horses, go para,.,aJhng. 
and go skin di"mg. 

CalPIRG Gets Vote, Next Step 
to Work with Administration 

The restaurants away from 
the hotel proved the place to be 
though. Senor Frogs, EI 
Shnmp Bucket. and EI Patio 
all came alive at mght WIth 
college students (and others) 
from all over singing and 
dancmg on tables. After 
dinner, e\'eryone usually 
headed to the extravagant 

The trip was definitely 
worthwhile and it was really 
fun to be Wit h a group of 
students from UCSD. We 
thank Campus Recreation and 
the student organizers for 
puttmg the Spring Fling 
together. The trip went very 
moothly and cou ld not h,l\'e 

been more orga n i zed. 
Hopefully. this trip and trip 
like it will be planned agam so 
others can enjoy them as much 

a~ we enjoyed Mazatlan .

Contrary to the CII(JydilJl/ 
art Icle by slaff \\ nter J df 
Savage. (April 18, 1983), the 

result~ of this referendum do 
have an enormous impact on 
laIPIRG's existence. Savage 
stated. "The outcome of this 
referendum \\ III have no effect 
on the fUlure of CaIP]}((; at 
LTCSD". The future of 
(all'mG is depelldent on the 
reaffirmation of student 
support that this referendum 
provided. Only by strength· 
enlllg our current funding 
systcm can CalPIRG contmu(' 
t() pro\lde sl udcnh wit h a 
strong ,'oice on issue'" that 
concern them. 

In 197H, s\t1denh \-(lted for a

alt hough any student COli Id

the admmistration changed 
the way the fee was assessed, 
wit hout consult mg "tudenh. 
This ~ Ignificanlly weakened 
CaIPIR(;'s fundmg. Student 
support dropped from .to% to 
9% t hat quarter. 

Voting "yes" for a stronger 
CalPIRG - raising the fee to 
S:LOO per quarter and 
changing Ihe way the fee is 
assessed - will allow 
CalPlRG to becoml'lmnl\'ed m

Put Us on the Battlefield to Recite Shakespeare at Russia 
8y JAMES RALPH PAPP 

Staff Wriler 
When the National Commis' 

s ion on Excellence in 
Education said thattheUnited 
Staes had commited "uni· 
lat eral educational disarma, 
ment ," it was unquestionably 
the most irrelevant statement 
ever uttered on the subject of 
American Schooling. At least, 
it was until Ronald Reagan 
provided hi s answers for 
reversing that disarmament. 
It is not surprising that there 
is in education a "rising tide of 
mediocrity," considering that 
the men the public engages to 
work out the problem seem to 
have suc h a tiny grasp of 
relevance and logic; however, 
"There is a tide in the affairs of 
men, which, taken at the flood, 
leads on to fortune ," as 
Shakespeare says in Julius 
Caesar IV_ iii. 217. The tide can 
be one of mediocrity, and the 
fortune political or profes, 
sional. 

I imagine that comparing 
education to t he arms race is 
merely a gimmick, perhaps to 
acclimatize people to spending 
as enor mou s amounts of 
money on t hei r sc hools as they 
do on their bombs, but the 
comparison communicates 
and clarifies very little. What 
has our education got to do 
with t he Russians? Suddenly 
"SpUI nik" is the word of the 
hour, as "keyster" wa~ a few 
mon ths ago. Is it the 
government's intentIOn to 
send us out on t he battlefield 

to recite Shakespeare against 
the Russians, or are we to 
settle t heownershipof Cent ral 
America at a spelling bee? 
Well , that pros pect pl eases me 
more than the idea of dying of 
radiation poison , but it is 
unlikely neverthele ss. 
"Sputnik" is a battle·c ry to 
lead us into a cold war battle 
against the Soviet Union, but 
one cannot see that a sa tellite 
has done them an awful lot of 
good considering their 
wretched domestic condition, 
or very much bad for the 
United States. Trying to beat 
the Japanese, for in stance, or 
the West Germans, who are 
our industrial competitors, isa 
much more logical motive than 
trying to outshine an 
economically, socially and 
politically moribund revolu, 
tionary empire. Actually, no 
motive which is not introspec· 
tive make real sen e; to 
attempt quality for it s ow n 
sa ke is more so und and 
proba bl y more prod uc t i ve 
than to attempt it merely to be 
better than somebody else 
(whether their achievements 
are real or imaginary). The 
Nationa l Commission on 
Exce ll en ce in Education 
appears to be more interested 
in dip lomas as industria l and 
mJlltar} investments than as 
sign of thinking human 
beings. 

The answers to I he 
problems the commi~sion 
giVl'" are standard: more time 
111 school ;Jncl more homework 

afterwards, which add LIP to 
more money to be spent. ThiS 
reveals political ignorance; no 
government, on the local, 
sta te, or federal level has the 
slightest intention of investing 
more money in education. or 
even the same amount as it'" 
spending now, as much as its 
officials pu blically approve the 
idea of better sc hooling . 
Ronald Reagan's ideas at least 
cost no money, but they have, 
to even the simplest mind 
(well, apparently not quite the 
s implest) nothing at all to do 
with the re ult s of the s tud y. 
Tuition tax credits, one of his 
suggestion s, will do wonders 
for private schouh:i but nothing 
for public ones, which most 
student s would still be forced, 

If you're a senior and have the promise of a $10,000 career-oriented job, do you know 
what's stopping you from getting the American Express' Card? 

You guessed it. 
Nothing. 
Because American Express believes in your future . But more than that. We beheve 

in you now. And we're provmg it . 
A $10,000 job promise. That's it. No trings. No gimmicks. And this offer IS 

even g(xx.l for 12 months after you graduate. 
But why do you need the American Express Card now ? 
First of all , it's a good way to begin to establish your credIt hlswry. And you 

know that's important . 
Of course, the Card is also good for rravel, re5taurant~, and ~hopping for thing~ 

like a new stereo or furniture. And because the Card is recognized and welcomed 
worldwide, so are you.

a baby away from its mother 
so it would develop self·

meantime cannot be guaran·

That is Mr. Reagan's next 
suggestion, but it seems 
unlikely that God would bless 
our education above anv other 
nation ·s. and any' closer 
connection between learnmg 
and prayer is not readily. or 
unreadily, obvious. Indeed, the

Cinderella and 'flashdance' 
continued from page 1 
of the "Cinderella Complex," 
For some unexplained reason 
the producers of this movies 
first give Alex an unbelievable 
type of independence. then they 
make her dependent upon a 
Prince Charming for her 
success, Had the director seen 
Alex as a complete person 
beyond the narrow view of his 
fantasy. the movie may have 

reached the level of Alex's 
ultimate realization, 

But for now, producers and 
directors need to realize it is not 
enough to present a dynamic 
soundtrack partnered to flashy 
commerical images, They need 
to create a movie that 
sensitively shows the effort and 
determination needed to 
become a daner. or anyone who 
dances to their own music.

FOR ALL YOU DO ... THIS 
BUD PAGE IS FOR YOU! 

Softball Preview 
Spring training is over and the rain has 

stopped (I hOpe). It must be time for the 
annual rite of spring at UCSD, softball 
season. I must admit that softball is a sport I 
hold more dear to me than any of the 
other sports. I mean what other sport is 
played in warm weather, has very little of 
the repulsive player-official bickering that 
goes on in other sports and lends itself to 
just plain old fun and a brew. It's obvious 
that the UCSD populace feels the same as 
yours truly. There are 275 teams playing 
intramural softball which makes it far and 
away the most popular sport at UCSD. 
Basketball is the next most popular sport 
at UCSD and it has 100 fewer teams. 

I think it appropriate at this time to give 
you the infamous Budman picks to win it 
all . It's ear1y in the season, I know, but the 
Budman has had a pretty good track 
record this year. 

Before I journey down prediction row I 
would like to congratulate the teams 
Weee Suk, Fun and Ames, John Delorean's 
Nose and Sit On My Base for your patience. 
I know it takes time to come up with a 
good name. On the other hand I think 
thumbs down IS appropriate for the 
teams: No Names, how long did it take 
them to think of that name; Flying Fangs, 
ugh; Masternatters and Jerry's Kids, most 
commonly used 1M team names; and last 
but leas~ Cock and Bat the Baby Seals, 
tacky. 

Now it's time to peer into my crystal ball . 
In the Men 's AAA division it looks like 

Snow White and the 17 Dwarfs. Get-a-
Grip, last year's champs, look to be far and 
away the most talent talented squad. last 
year's team did not lose a game in winning 
the championship. They also d idn't lose a 
player off that squad and look like the 
team to beat. After Get-a-Grip its a toss up 
to see who's going to be the bridesmaid. 
Perenially tough Profoathletics look to be 
the Philadelphia Phillies of 1M's. They can 
still play but if they run out ofGeritol it's all 
over for them. Mike McKeown's always 
tough Biomavericks could be a factor just 
as the Dodgers could be. They let go of a 
lot of talented free agents who signed on 
with other squads. It's sa id owner Ken 
Buckley wouldn't come up with enough 
grant money. So now they have some 
ta lented rookies at first and right field with 
some big shoes to fill. We' ll have to wait 
and see about this squad. lastly, the 
Sliding Drabos are always a factor w ith 
their matching uniforms and their large 
following of 10 wives and 40 kids. 

The AA division IS Known this year as the 
sandbag division ala AA football fall 
quarter. Captain Leonard Shulman of Only 
Queens Drag Bunt went out and signed 
more ta lented free agent than George 
Steinbrenner. In spring training they went 
out and whooped the defending AAA 
champs Get-A-Grip. His squad was ready 
to take on the best. The 1M team captain's 
meeting rolled aroung and no Drag Bunt 
squad shows up in the AAA division. A 
mistake maybe? Nope! Drag Bunt signed 
up In AA. Another claSSIC case of "We can 
be competitive and make the playoffs inA 
but we Will WIN AA." #2 In the sandbag 
diviSion belongs to Tim Pickwell and hiS 

Volleyball Rankings 
Men's Open Men's A 

Dynasty team: He got his last name 
because he always picks the right division. 
His team name may be a hint at how good 
he thinks his team is. Rupe's Troops could 
be a factor here but the old olive seed 
always seems to get caught. Ziggy and the 
Rabbis is the most surprising preseason 
team, These House of David clones only 
need beards to win it all. 

In the Men's A division I always need 
more of Dickie Noles' favorite beverage 
before I can even see a favorite in my 
crystal ball . Right now I would have to pick 
the Backdoor Men. They've been playing A 
for years and should be about ready for 
glory. Rumor has it though that some of 
their players are good enough to play AA 
and might.. .. Another squad to watch is 
Alan's last Stand. Tremendous talent but 
always gags in the playoffs. These guys 
have been playing A in 1M's for four years in 
all the different sports. They haven't tasted 
any victory champagne yet. These guys 
have to be the sentimental choice. 

Coed AA for the first time since UCSD's 
biology department opened in 1969 is a 
wide open division. Why, you ask? Because 
the biology department has been turning 
out softball players more often thanM.D.s. 
Usually it has been their women who have 
carried the guys. From 'Slamming' Carol 
Post to 'The Gun' Janice Yip it has always 
been a dynasty. There's that word dynasty 
again. Tim Pickwell also has a Dynasty team 
in coed AA. Or so he thinks. I hear at least 
the pitching is better on his coed team. 
Stroke It Up the Middle should be the class 
of this division. Bonnie Betz is on the 
injured reserve list right now and that hurts 
because she's a top player. l ook for Stroke 
It Up the Middle to win it if Bonnie returns. 

Coed A is our largest division . I always 
like the tact that more softball teams make 
the playoffs in this division than are in the 
entire program of some other schools. 
Needless to say this is a tough division to 
pick. My crystal ball has it's limits. let me 
switch to my magic hat and pull out some 
hopefuls. Special Beat Service - you can't 
beat these girls. Women Are Smarter Than 
Men - better too. Swamp - could run 
out of reruns. Beaver's Buddies and Wally's 
Women - June would be proud. Campus 
Creepers - great scouting system in those 
white cars they drive. Life Begins At 
Second Base - I hope they make it home. 
Don't Want To Be Your Slave - soccer 
players now have to use their hands. 

Last, but definitely not leas~ is the 
Women's division. If this division keeps 
growing as it has over the last couple ot 
years we are going to need more fields at 
UCSD to support our growing women's 
program. Come to think of it that's not a 
bad idea. The favorites look to be the 
always tough Brown Sugar team. Damita 
Davis leads this talented squad w ith speed 
and powe~ A new team on the b lock is 
the Raisins. These volleyball players have 
loads ot talent. It they can just stay away 
from volleyball long enough it won 't screw 
up their softball. 

Well that raps It up for our preseason 
forecast. Look tor next week's Bud page to 
see who really should win.

fantasy and comedy at Old Globe 
8y JOM fORSBfRG 

Peter Pan swore he would 
never grow up. Well. he did. 
Playwright Ellis Rabb recorded 
the inevitable event in his new 
play Clap Your Hands currently 
being presented at the Old 
Globe Theatre in Balboa Park. 

This world pr emie r e 
production presents James M. 
Barrie 's original characters of 
Peter Pan , Wendy, and Mr. 
Darling confronting the harsh 
truths of human existence. 
Exiled from Never Land, the 40· 
year old Peter Pan faces a 
mid life crisis. After Tinker Bell's 
death (because children no 
longer believed in fairies), Peter 

returns to the Darling home to 
find Wendy as a dreary, middle-
aged <;ociety matron and Mr. 
Darling as an elderly widower 
living on distant memories. 

Wendy's brother John is an 
alcoholic proctoloQist. and 
Captain Hook s enemy, that 
ravenous crocidile. is stuffed 
and displayed in the Darling's 
domicile. 

Wendy can no longer see 
Peter, and Peter can no longer 
fly. The fantasies created by 
children are now realities 
endured by adults. But all is not 
in despair. 

Together Peter, Wendy, and 
Mr. Darling examine the 

transitions. of time. Whdl 
emerges is a magical 
exploration uf dredms and 
adventures that rekindle 
youth s flaming spirit and 
imagination in mature livcs. 

Clap Your Hands reatures 
mastcrful performan[e~ by 
Ralph Williams as Peter. Patricia 
Conolly as Wendy, and G. Wood 
as Mr Darling. This fascinating 
production continues through 
May 22.

Christopher Randolph and JIIariangela Fino star in "The Trial" 

The UCSD Theatre presents a 
new adaptation of Franz KatKa s 
mysterious novel. The Trial. 
Adapted and directed by Steve 
Pearson. The Trial is a riveting, 
fast· paced psychological drama 
of what happens to someone 
who is victimized , namely 
Joseph 1\. 

Joseph awakes on the 
morning of his 30th birthday to 
find himself under arrest. But 
for what? No one will tell him 
why. Without specification of 
charges, he is sent through 
interrogations and appeals 
never knowing what he is 
accused of. The worlds of day 
and night. reality and nightmare 
begin to collide, building to a 

startling condusioll. 
Pear~n who played thc 

character Joseph K. in thc 
Pittsburgh City Theatre 
production directed by Je\wl 
Walker in 1977. sees the playas 
a continuous dream or 
nightmare. You re never quitc 
sure if what you are seeing is 
actually happening, or just 
Joseph's own images -just like 
the character himself. But it is 
just real enough to make you 
wonder. 

The oppression ofthe law, the 
stringency of authority. and the 
torture the state can inflict on 
the individual are dramatically 
portrayed In this story, as well 
as the individuals own failings 

In tatong responsibility for 
his 'her per">Onal ~ituatJon. The 
idea that we are victim only 
when we permit our'>el\eo; to be 
h d theme thlt dirt:clor Pearson 
stresses. 

A cast of ten graduate .. and 
undugraduate actoro; in thc 
Drama Department will playa 
total of 27 roles with 
Christopher Randolph as Joseph 
1\, Pearson has also added four 
characters as "watchers: 
figures that /\atka eludes to in 
the novel. Peter Ward is 
composing music for thc play, 
working with the absencc and 
presence of sound as important 
theme.'>. 

The play opcns tonight and

Images of lVicaragua 
By CMlOll: 

Across the street from cafe Complaicent in the quiet retired 
military village of La Jolla images of burned and bloody bodies are 
hanging next to revolutionary writings on the wall. 

Even though revolutions are occurring throughout the world, 
Americans know little of what it is like to live in a war torn 
community. So the director of "The Photography Gallery", tlolly 
tlowelL decided to show Susan Meiselas' powerful and thought 
provoking photographs of the Nicaraguan revolution . 

But it was not easy for Meiselas to capture these images. In 
January of 1979 the car in which she and two otherjournalists were 
riding struck a land mine. Onejournalist died and Meiselas received 
wounds to her head, neck, and shoulders. Another time she wired 
New York for more film. With the film she received a new 300mm 
telephoto lens because her editors felt she was getting too close to 
the action. For her actions Meiselas received the Robert Capa Prile 
from the Overseas Press Club for' best photographic reporting or 
interpretation from abroad requiring exceptional courage and 
enterprise," 

Meiselas is not one to rest on her reputation or awards. Currently 
she is in EI Salvador photographing people dying in hopes that her 
images will keep our concern for injustices to others alive. 

The purpose of Meiselas' work is to shed light on the situa tion in 
Central America. 11er black framed photographs are not for sale 
commercially. tlowever Howell is taking donations to purchase 
three photos which will be given to the new San Diego Museum for 
Photographic Arts.

Mixing punk 
and studies 
with Milo 

By STEPHAN WYSS 
Though much oftoday's new 

music' has gained widespred 
popular acceptance, the punk 
movement is still viewed 
negatilely by much of society. 
Punk audiences are notorious 
for their extreme behavior, and 
punk musicians are often 
looked upon as misguided 
sociopaths who have little, if 
any, knowledge of their 
ins truments. 

Judging solely from 
appearances, UCSD sophomore 
Milo Aukerman might appear 
like the kind of person one sees 
in computer labs late on a 
Saturday night. It would be 
impossible to know that th is 
see mingly m i ld , sedat e, 

una~uminq honor.. student 
was until recently the lead 
singer of a band from th e same 
Los Angele s scen e which 
spawned hardcore favorites like 
Black flag and the Circle Jerks. 

The new album by the 
Descendents commorates the 
event which took Milo away 
from the band. Their new Milo 
Goes to College, aside from 
getting heavy airplay in 
Assorted Vinyl. has gotten 
mostly positive reviews from 
the mainstream critics, and was 
also voted "album of the year" 
by the readers of the LA punk 
magazine flips ide. So far. the 
album has sold 5000 copies. 

The band was formed in 1979. 
After the original members, 

f rank Navetta , Bill Stevenson, 
and Ton y Lombard o, had 
released a single which sounds 
more surf than punk. Milo took 
on the vocal chores because he 
'- l iked the musil and wanted to 
be a part o f it." ln the summer of 
1981 a fivt: song, seven inch 45 
was released. This record 
brought the Descendents 
recognition because of the two 
food songs, the 11 second 
" Weinerschnitzel. " and the 15 
second " I Like Food " 

The band was not altogether 
pleased with the reaction to the 
EP because ' it pigeonholed the 
Descendents as a food band." 
The record s title, fat. and t h(' 
cheeseburger cover did not 
help, even though none of the

Concert line 
The legendary Kinks 
return to SD tonight 

By JOHN Nff 
Rock and roll hasalways been 

a derivative of some sort from 
other genres of music. 
Throughout its history, rock has 
been influenced by the blues, 
jazz, classical. funk and ethnic 
influences. The Kinks have 
been accused on many 
occasions of relying too much 
on the material of other artists 
in order to produce material. 

To a certain extent this is 
true. In the past the Kinks have 
had a shaky career. They have 
resorted to such dubious 
practices as copying other 
groups and even copying 
themselves on much of their 
later material. What the Kinks 
have created has been a style 
that helped define the idea of 
pop-rock during the 70'1, 

By no means could the Kinks 

be considered new music. They 
are simply a guitar-heavy 
"supergroup," As a performing 
entity they are great if only 
viewed once. In a live medium 
the Kinks have a very tight 
polished show leaving very little 
room for a real show to take 
place. 

Tonight Ray Davies will 
march up on stage and playa set 
that may be heard on The Kinks' 
live album with the highlight of 
the act being his refu~1 to play 
"Lola." It really is always a 
disappomtment seeing men 
past their prime on stage. The 
Kinks will play this evening at 
the Sports Arena. 

The stranglers will play 
Saturday at the Adams Ave. 
Theater. Joe "King" Carasco 
will play tonight at the Spirit. 

Rocking with Milo 
continueli from page 5 

'The majority or punks put on 
a pose. A lot of them take the 
lyrics too seriously and they get 
violent. A lot of punk lyrics is 
overstatement to prove a point. 
Many of the punks need a thing 
to believe in. I'm not a punk. I 
just played for a punk 
aUdience." 

Ttte first year after high 
s(hool , Milo attended a local 
Junior college and worked, but 
he knew he would have to leave 

the band eventually, so he left 
"the pressure" and came to 
UCSD. Since he began at UCSD 
late September, some of his 
attitudes have changed. "I used 
to stereotype people for what 
they wore, but after going here I 
find that it doesn't matter how 
you dress, preppy or whatever, 
it's what's inside that counts. 
You don't find a lot of the frat-
boy mentality here. I guesss I'm 
lucky I chose a school with a 
good diversity of people."

somehow the new effort seems a 
little forced and therefore less 
spontaneous. 

The album is not totally 
without its good moments, 
however. The reggae intluence is 
if anything more strongly felt. 
with songs like "It's a Mistake," 
"Blue for You," and even the 
simply pleasant "Settle Down 
My Boy" all ha ving a tinge of 
those easy-going reggae 
rhythms. However, thi\ album 
unfortunately ranges from the 
simply pleasant to the simply 
silly. " Dr, Heckyll and Mr. Jive," 
"I'd Like To," and "Upstairs in 
My House" .III come off as 

nothing more than vinyl filler, 
and not very good filler at that. 

At this writing, Business as 
Usual is still among the top five 
selling albums nationally, 
Presumably it is still selling so 
well only because people who 
have purchased it previously 
have worn out their first copy 
and are going on their second. I 
think therein lies one of the 
main reasons why Cargo will not 
fare as well with the critics or 
with the populus. While it is a 
fact that Men at Work brought 
with them a breath of fesh 
Austrailian air with Business as 
Usual, it is also a fact that this 
fresh air was made quite stale by 
some FM stations, which did 
their best to take two very good 
songs, "Who Can It Be Now?" 
and "Down Under," and drive 
them absolutely into the 
ground. This endless repetition 

is what will ultimately hurt the 
new album; the Men at Work 
sound is nothing new anymore, 
and more of it that isn ·t as good 
won't breathe any new life into 
it. The current single. 
appropriately entitled 
"Overkill, " is quite refreShing, 
but once you've heard it. you 've 
heard the best song on the 
album, and there isn·t too much 
point in continuinA, 

I personally Ii ke Men at Work; 
I am not quite tired of their style 
just yet. and therefore I can still 
appreciate new music from an 
overplayed sound. 

If this describes you. then 
you 'll like Cargo. But if you are 
weary of Business as Usual, or 
if you never liked it to begin 
with, you may want to pass on 
what amounts to .. Business as 
Usual II."

A modern day Cinderella comes 
in the fonn of a 'flashdance' 

By CA/"lOlL 
When you hear the music, do 

you close your eyes and feel the 
beat of your heart to the 
rhythm? Does a flash of passion 
pulse into your life creating an 
uncontrollable urge to dance? 

You may be a flashdancer. 
Do you wish you could take 

your inner passions and make 
them happen? 

Would you push your mind 
and body beyond their limits. 
And do whatever is necessary to 
experience a flash forward intoa 
life of living your dreams? 

Then you are a flashdancer. 
The opening song to the 

movie flashdancer presents 
these ideas about life. But 
instead of probing further into 
these issues, the movie 
becomes another ci nderella 
story. 

Alex. a steel town Cinderella, 
dresses in overalls and army 
fatigues for her welding chores. 
After work she dances at a local 
bar. Then she bicycles home to 
work-out and fine tune her 
dancing in hopes of being 
invited to dance at the ball, in 
this case the Pittsburgh 
Conservatory of Dance. 

Alex's dance mento\' is her 
fairy godmother. And the steel 
mill owner becomes Prince 
Charming, complete with an 
invitation to the ball. 

Many dancers resent this 
simplistic portrayal of what it 
takes to become a professional 

dancer. And yet many have also 
expressed their enjoyment of 
the movie's one attribute, the 
dance sequences. 

The dance routines in this 
movie have been produced to 

expressions radiate an ecstacy 
for life that seems to give her 
unlimited energy. An energy 
which flashes with Beals' smile 
to excite the audience. One 
wonders though if this workout 

Jennifer Beals aspires to be a professional dancer in " flashdance." 

seductively advertize the 
flashdance soundtrack in the 
same way mv promotes records 
through television . Coming 
from a background in making 
television commercials , 
director Adrian Lyne uses soft 
porn techniques to present 
Jennifer Beals as the ultimate 
male fantasy of a dancer. 

During her end of the day 
dance ritual. Alex's facial 

is intended to improve her 
dancing or to SUblimate some 
sexual expression. 

The sensuality of Beals ' 
portrayal matches the body heat 
generated by John Travolta in 
Saturday Night fever. and the 
soon to be released Staying 
Alive Alex is not a Cinderella of 
the Disney type. 

Alex is, however, an example

Cinderella and 'flashdance' 
continued from page 1 
of the "Cinderella Complex," 
For some unexplained reason 
the producers of this movies 
first give Alex an unbelievable 
type of independence. then they 
make her dependent upon a 
Prince Charming for her 
success, Had the director seen 
Alex as a complete person 
beyond the narrow view of his 
fantasy. the movie may have 

reached the level of Alex's 
ultimate realization, 

But for now, producers and 
directors need to realize it is not 
enough to present a dynamic 
soundtrack partnered to flashy 
commerical images, They need 
to create a movie that 
sensitively shows the effort and 
determination needed to 
become a daner. or anyone who 
dances to their own music.
