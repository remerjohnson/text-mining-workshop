Court Forces 
UC Rehiring 
PoHcy Change 

By DARCY GRIFFIN 
Contributing Writer 

Non-tenured faculty on UCcam-
puses will no longer have to com-
pete against a pool of applicants 
seeking reappointment to the same 
position, according to a recent 
state judge's decision. 

Administrative Judge Manuel 
Melgoza ruled that the UC's pol-
icy of requiring faculty to com-
pete against a national pool of 
applicants at the time of their elig-
ibility for a three-year contract 
was in violation of the Higher 
Education Employer-Employee 
Relations Act. 

UC must stop the illegal practi-
ces, Melgoza ordered, and reim-
burse lost wages and benefits to 
affected faculty. 

"This case marks a major vic-
tory of the union in defense of 
lecturer's rights violated by the 
UC administration," said Gary 
Adest, executive director of the 
UC American Federation of Teac-
hers (UC-AFT). 

"The administration continual-
ly attempts to exercise 'manage-
ment prerogatives'without regard 
to the jobs and lives of non-senate 
faculty," he added, "but the law 
won't allow it." He stated that the ·

UCSD Must Follow 
Federal Drug Policy 

As of Jan. 16, all employees of 
the University of California , in-
cluding students with on-campus 
jobs, will be required by federal 
law to maintain a drug-free work-
place. 

"This policy would apply to 
students when the student has an 
employee relationship with the 
University ," said Gerald Reid of 
the UCSD Personnel Depart-
ment. 

The policy prohibits illegal use, 
possession, or distribution of con-
trolled substances by University 
employees in the workplace. The 
policy also specifies the possible 
penalities for violation of the 
drug-free environment and man-
dates the notification of all em-
ployees of the availability of pre-
vention, counseling, and referral 
programs. 

However, the policy does not 
specify enforcement tactics such 
as random drug testing. "There 
are so many legal and ethical 
questions with regard to random 
testing that there is a lot of confu-
sion," said Jim D'Artenay, direc-
tor of the Faculty and Staff 
Assistance Program. One of the 
functions of this program is to 
help University employees with 
drug problems. 

'" know that the University 
supports, from an ethical stand-

point , the idea of privacy for 
employees," D'Artenay said , "so I 
don't see testing as an option for 
the University." 

"What I'm hoping to see in 
future legislation is a program 
that will help students whether 
they are employees of the Univer-
sity or not," D'Artenay said . 

The new written policy is in 
response to the Treasury and Pos-
tal Appropriations Bill signed by 
President Reagan on Sept. 22. 
This bill requires all federal con-
tractors to implement a written 
policy in support of a drug-free 
workplace. As a federal contrac-
tor, the University must comply 
or face suspension, termination 
or disbarment from federal con-
tracts. 

"Our biggest concern is that 
many people are still [feeling 
stigmatized by drug and alcohol 
dependency] .. . and ... they 
believe that there is no help," D. 
Artenay said. "I think we've come 
a long way legislatively as a culture 
in admitting we have a problem. " 

gUlsed ruse to undermme our 
contract by avoiding multi-year 
commitments to teachers .... The 
administration is definitely not 
into long-term commitments." 

UCSD Avoids Computer Damage 

The UCSD GlMlrdMn will 
be sponsoring a free public 
forum tomorrow with some 
of Sao Dieao's '0, print 
journalists. 

The event. IChecluled for 
7:30 p.m. in Peterson Hairs 
Room 108, will focus on 
ways in which the San Diego 
pr:eu can be imprOVed and 
will feature a panel of dis-
ti..,wshed memben of the 
San Diqo preIS corps. 

The UC-AFT contract allows 
for a national affirmative action 
search before a lecturer is initially 
hired. It abo stipulates that 
employed lecturers with six years 
of service earn "excellent" marks 
in an extensive performance eva-
luation before they can receive a 
multi-year reappointment.

Berkeley graduate ~ludent Gay Seidman realized she might 
encounter some difficulties while doing research in South Africa 
on that country's unions. 

Nonetheless, she was surprised 1'0 find a street full of tanks 
when she arrived at a union building for an interview with a

"I rushed into the building across the street and watched the 
police go up the [union] building floor by floor beating up 
unionists," she said . 

Seidman thus made a new appointment to interview the min-
erai worker the following week. 

"I came by the next Wednesday and the same thing was 
happening! . . . The police would arrest all the unionists and 
release them the next day. So I made yet another appointment for

The effects on UCSD's campu 

were minimal since the campus 
system was disconnected in time 
to halt its spread here . 

The virus arrived on campus 
on Nov. 2 between 6 and 8 p.m. 
and was first noticed by linguis-
tics professor Jeff Ellman. 

Once detected, Ellman and a 
four-person team of UCSD com-
puter experts struggled through a 
sleepless night di connecting 
UCSD's computer network from 
outside sources. 

By about 8 a .m ., they had suc-
cessfully completed their task and 
by 2 p.m. , thing~ were back to 
normal on campus, though through-
out the rest of the nation, the pro-
gram's effects were still being felt. 

UCSD Academic Network Oper-
ations Manager Jim Madden sa.id 
that one effect of the virus is social 
in nature. 

He felt that "the person who · 
[introduced the program] did some-
thing intetesting and amazing, 
but didn't think about the effect 
at all. 

"Social effect is the frightening and 
undetermined thing here," he said . 

"It is clear that we omehow 
need to concentrate more on 
teaching ethics in computing and 
technology. "

According to Madden, such a 
widely spread computer virus 
sends a warning message to per-
sonal computer owners which 
results in many of them being too 
frightened to connect their com-
puter to a network system. This 
fear limits computer owners' per-
sonal access to information , he 
said . 

The nationwide panic began 
when Robert Tappan Morris , a 
23-year-old computer science 
graduate at Cornell University, 
allegedly wrote and introduced a 
elf-replicating program into a 

computer linkage system. 
Arpanet, the computer network 

ystem that served as the pro-
gram's transfer mechanism, con-
nects research centers, universi-
ties, and military bases and made 
possible the rapid spread of the 
program. 

Morris is reported to have 
inserted his program into a fea-
ture of Arpanet called Sendmail 
which allows computer users to 
exchange messages electronically 
between computers. 

Once in Sendmail, the virus 
began to copy itself and transfer 
from computer to computer by

UC Telescope Ready to be 
Placed at Mauna Kea 

Workers have completed the dome of the W. M. 
Keck Observatory atop Mauna Kea, Hawaii , and the 
structure now lands ready to receive the world's larg-
est telescope. 

The gleaming white dome is 100 feet high and 
weighs 700 tons. It was built in Canada and hauled by 
truck in piece from dockside in Hawaii to the Mauna 
Kea summit. At 13,788 feet, the summit is the highest 
point in the Pacific and widely regarded as the world 's 
best astronomical site. 

Assembly of the Keck telescope will constitute the 
next phase of work at the observatory. The $87 mil-
lio!, project, scheduled for completion in 1991 , is a 
joint venture by the University of California and the 
California Institute of Technology.

UCLA May Replace Film Major 
With Interdisciplinary Studies 

LOS ANGELES - Faculty in UCLA's department 
of film and television voted Nov. 2 to replace the 
undergraduate film program with an interdisciplinary 
major by 1990. 

Professor Howard Suber, the proposal's author, 
said the new program would not compromise under-
graduate education as opponents have charged. 
Instead , he said , the proposals should help adminis-
trators trim the number of film students, allowing 
them to better educate each student. Under his pro-
posal students would more easily access the 
equipment. 

Opponents of the proposals, including Professor 
John Boehm, claim that minority and low-income 
students would be unable to obtain true film degrees 
because graduate school is too expensive. 

Professor Richard Walter said undergraduates have 
complained that they are second-class citizens com-
pared to graduate film students. He said placing 
underrepresented students in such an "inadequate" 
program was "tokenism." But he felt that an interde-
partmental major would give students a "well-
rounded education." 

The Executive Committee of the College of Fine 
Arts will now consider both proposals (to close the 

undergraduate film program and replace it with an 
interdisciplinary major). If approved there, the resolu-
tions require approval from the Committee on 
Undergraduate Courses and Curriculum, the UCL A 
Academic Senate and the UC-wide Academic Senate.

UCSD Receives Donation of 
Computer Equipment and Software 

The department of Electrical and Computer Engi-
neering (ECE) at UCSD has received a gift of $1.8 
million worth of state-of-the-art computer equipment 
and software from Apollo Computer Inc. and Mentor 
Graphics Corp. 

The equipment will be used to train graduate and 
undergraduate students in the computer-aided design 
of Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) integrated cir-
cuits (I C). 

Apollo, headquartered in Chelmsford, MA, has 
given UCSD seven Series 3500 workstations along 
with three laser printers, and Mentor Graphics, of 
Beaverton, OR, has contributed the software. 

About two dozen graduate students will use the 
new equipment and many undergraduates will also 
have access to it. 

Impacted Engineering Major 
Policy Reviewed by Committee 

A special faculty committee has been appointed to 
review the UCSD policy of admitting new students in 
engineering as pre-majors, rather than directly to 
the major. Unlike other UC campuses, entrance to 
these impacted majors at UCSD is based on perfor-
mance in college level screening courses, rather than 
high school grades and test scores. 

Two open meetings have been called this week to 
seek student input in this question. The first, tomor-
row at 3 p.m., will be held at the Career Services Cen-
ter, and the second will be held Nov. 16 from 3 to 5 
p.m. in conference room III A on the Matthews 
campus. 

The chair of the committee, Revelle Provost Tom 
Bond, is encouraging students affected by this policy 
to present their views at these meetings. He empha-
sized that on one hand the policy allows more stu-
dents a chance at these popular majors, but on the 
other side has an obvious negativ~ impact on those 
who do not make the high GPA cut-offs. 

Students unable to attend either meeting are 
encouraged to send their comments to the committee, 
c/ o Provost Bond at UCSD, B-021 , La Jolla , CA 
92093. After the committee ha evaluated all a pects 
of the question it will report to Vice Chancellor of 
Academic Affairs Harold Ticho. Any proposed 
change in a long standing campus policy of not using 
one's major as a factor in admissions decisions would 
be subject to further approval by faculty committees.

LOS ANGELES - At a time 
when alternative media are needed 
to cover a "rainbow" of minority 
groups on college campuses, their 
existence is threatened by poor 
funding and culturally-insensitive 
students, according to panicipants 
in a Nov. 3 converence at UCLA. 

At the day-long "Campus 
Media and Minority Issues"con-
ference, about I 00 students and 
professional journalists discussed 
solutions to the problems of al-
ternative media and the impor-
tance of covering minority affairs .

Club Hosts 
Benefit Event

..-

San Diego area skate borders, 
including many from the UCSD 
RTS Skate Club, gathered for a 
seven hour !tkate marathon last 
Friday at the UCSD skateboard 
ramp. The event was a benefit for 
San Diego area battered women 
and children. 

Those attending were asked to 
bring canned food or a $1 dona-
tion to be given to the YWCA's 
Battered Women's Shelter in down-
town San Diego. 

H8.1li Ten, a clothing mamt 
racturer and sponsor of marfy Of 
the skaters present, also donated 
$25 to the event, according to 
Steve Villareal , president of the 
skate club, which helped organize 
the benefit. 

The fund raising began last 
Wednesday when the club col-
lected $23 at a booth in Revelle 
Plaza. By the end of the Friday 
exhibition, the proceeds totaled 
almost $100 and one large box of 
canned food. 

Guiterrez, a USC journalism pro-
fessor and Associated Press writ-
er. 

Guiterrez said that integration 
through education "has always 
been a myth" and that campus 
media "must realize that there are 
many voices on campus and that 
they will grow. not diminish." 

In that regard , he praised spe-
cial interest publications for their 
individuality and involvement in 
issues close to them. "Rather than 
value objectivity, the alternate 
press values participation, caring, 
and concern," Guitterez said. 

In a panel discussion after his 
speech, student editors of alter-
nate publications said problems 
they face include funding and 
insensitivity. 

Stephanie Lopez, editor of the 
Chicano publication fA Voz 

NEWS 
Mestiza at UC Irvine, said her 
paper is admittedly "militant" 
because of the University's and 
Associated Students' "cultural 
ignorance and insensitivity." 

She said the paper's goal is to 
educate the campus community. 

Julie Fuller, editor of Nommo, 
UCLA's black student paper, 
spoke of "an era of conservatism" 
on today's campuses, saying many 
alternative papers exist in an 
"atmosphere 01 almost censor-
ship." 

"We are looked upon as en-
dangering the group who is in 
power - the administration and 
student government," she said. 

Adriana Manjarrez from 
UCLA's Chicano-Latino news-
paper, La Gente, said funding the 
paper previously received from 
student fees had been cut, and 
that her staff must now "focus on 
raising money, which is always a 
struggle." 

"]t took a little energy to get 
people to give," Villareal said. 
"But, the people who did give 
were really supportive of the 
cause." 

On _ roll - San Dieguito High's Shawn Andrews participated as a 
guest skater in last Friday's fundraiser lor battered women and 
children hosted by UCSD's skateboarding club. 

Last week's fund raising was not 
the first time the club has organ-
ized 'to help the shelter, nor will it 
be . the last. A similar event was 
held last spring and as Villareal 
mentioned, there are plans for a 
skating exhibition each quarter 
this year. 

"It went pretty well [last spring]. 
We got more money this time, but 
last time we had mort.' canned 
food," Villareal observed. 

The club decided to reiise money 

for the shelter last year when they, 
"Wanted to do some sort of com-
munity service," Villareal said. 
"We wanted to help out a cenain 
organization that really nceded 
help." 

They discovered the shelter's 
name on a slip of charitable organi-
zations at last year's Volunteer 
Connection and Villareal com-
mented that "this one seemed to 
be the one that was in the most 
desperate need for help."

S.Africa:CoOoquiunr 
Continued rrom pale I 
blown up!" 

Seidman told the story at a 
sociology department colloquium 
on South Africa's non-racial 
unions, during which she defended 
her theory that economics rather 
than ideology explains the rise of 
these unions. 

During the first half of the col-
loquium, Seidman, reading from 
a prepared text, outlined her the-
ory that South Africa's labor 
movement is more a product of 
the country's industrial strategy 
than of any anti-apartheid ideo-
logical doctrine. 

South Africa's industrial stra-
tegy has involved developing 
heavy industry, most significantly 
in minerals. 

Seidman sees two results of this 
strategy that have combined to 
mobilize the working class. 

One result of the industrial 
strategy, according to Seidman, 
has been the creation of a large 
class of semi-skilled industrial 
workers, almost exclusively non-
white, forced to live in govern-
ment-designated communities. 

The workers began to see their 
workplace and their community 
as one entity. When black ornon-
racial unions were first recognized 
in 1980, they stressed exclusively 
"bread and butter issues," but 
eventually moved to include the 
political demands that became 
prevalent in these new urban 
communities. 

The second result of South 
Africa's industrial strategy has 
been an "inevitable economic

SETH SLATER, News Editor 
KELL Y FLANIGAN, Opinion Editor 

The Guardian is published twice weekly at the UniversilY of California. 
San Diego. Contenl$ -1 988. Views expressed herein are not necessarily 
those: of the UC Board of R<ac:nll. the ASUCSD or the Guardian. 

One For 1,700 
UCSD's population grows ever larger, and the 

despair and confusion of one student can get lost in 
the shuffle. We are beginning to encounter the prob-
lems of overcrowding that have already reached epi-
demic proportions at San ~iego State. 

An SOS U student attempted suicide this year. She 
was on the waiting list to be seen by a psychological 
counselor, but the Daily Aztec says the wait is often as 
long as an entire semester. When this woman called 
she said no, she did not require immediate care. Inter-
viewed after the suicide attempt, the woman said she 
was embarrassed about receiving counseling in the 
first place, and had difficulty revealing how desperate 
she was. 

We decided to find out if this could happen here. 
We called UCSO's psychological counseling services 
and asked for the first possible appointment. The 
earliest available date was two weeks away. Are any 
ervices available sooner, we asked? We were told to 

come in and fill out paperwork for a group seminar. 
Despite our insistence on getting help ~uickly, no ~me 
ever asked whether we needed immediate counseling. 
When one of us went in for information about the 
group session, we were told it had been cancelle~. 

We then called Richard Whitehill, clinical director 
of UCSD's psychological counseling services, to find 
out how they plan to deal with increased enrollment. 
The program has 10 counselors for UCSO's 17,000 
graduates and undergraduates. Whitehill said that 
while "of course it would be nice" to have more 
counselors and the current two week waiting period is 
"uncomfortable," he feels the program "has been 
treated quite well" as far as budget allowances. 

The only suggestions he offered for dealing with 
student demand involved shortcuts. Increased reliance 
on group counseling, he said, is one shortcut. (Unfor-
tunately, these groups start at the beginning of the 
quarter and adding new students later can be distur-
bing to the group. Thus , group counseling does not 
provide much immediate help.) Shortening visits to 
half an hour after a student is receiving counseling 
regularly is another shortcut. Or students may be 
asked to limit regular visits to one every other week. 

Whitehill sums up his attitude about mental 
health : "Students have to be psychologically healthy 
just to get in here (UCSO). Most of the problems we 
deal with are not life-threatening." Whitehill is dead 
wrong: the pressure to succeed and the indepen-
dence of much of the student body makes them more 
needy of help, not less . At the same time , they are 
probably not used to asking for help. 

Expanding the number of students at UCSO 
means expanding other services as well. The quality 
of student life should not suffer as the student popuLa-
tion increases. 

Apathy in the A.S. 
Significant changes in campus policy jeopardizing 

student rights, particularly the right to a hearing were 
made this year. The provision in UCSO policy 
requiring the input of students was virtually ignore~. 

The administration doesn't bear complete responsI-
bility for not consulting students. The A.S. failed to 
appoint the requisite number of students to the 
committee evaluating changes. 

The A .S. council resisted opportunities this quarter 
to correct their mistakes, twice rejecting propo als 
that urged the administration to reverse the new 
policy. 

A.S . President Maynard Dimmesdale and Student 
Rights Advocate Bard Alan Finlan fi .n~J1y oyercame 
resistance from the A.S. and the Administration. The 
A .S . approved a revised resolution calling for re-
evaluation of changes made in UCSO policy. 
Chancellor Atkinson has said "he would revoke the 
policy" if so advised by the council. 

Now, all we can do is question why the A .S . wasn't 
on the side of student rights and hope that this time 
Atkinson is.

Defending 
Wiesenthal 
Editor: 

As the chairman of the National 
Issues Forum, the group responsible 
for bringing Simon Wiesenthal to 
UCSD last Monday, I feel obliged to 
defend his work and his reputation. 
This attack (letters, Guardian, Nov. 
10) couldn't be ignored. 

Wiesen thai stands as a beacon of 
hope and remembrance for all 
humanity, not just the Jewish people. 
His untiring efforts in bringing the, 
Nazi criminals of the World War II 
era to justice serve as an example to 
all of us. Your pot shots at Israel's 
military leaders are blatantly one-
sided anti-Semitic thrusts at a nation 
with int.ernal proble~s . 

When you say, "who will bring 
Israeli war criminals to justice after 
they have annihilated the Palestinian 
people?" you completely ignore the 
terrorist atrocities of the PLO and 
other groups backed by Syria and 
other Arab governments . Is the 
enforcement of law and order in 
Israel to be termed as a war crime? 
Genos;ide? Admittedly, Israel has 
problems to solve in Gaza and the 
West Bank, but their present actions 
are far from anyone's definition of 
genocide. 

You ask why Wiesenthal excludes 
Israel from ever playing host to a 

...... _ .. --

holocaust in the present day and I 
answer that he does not. If you had 
been in attendance Monday night , 

. you would not have heard any such 
exclusion. I invite you to come and 
listen to the audio tape (which our 
office has on file) and draw your con-
elusions from that, a speech which 
brought over 2,000 people to their 
feet for a standing ovation. 

Wiesenthal is not asking us to sup-
port Israel's current policies in Gaza, 
but its right to exist. Your accusation 
;that Wiesenthal's work is "useless and 
contrary to the present historical 
events" shows your incredible mis-
understanding of the man.

Election Fervor 
Recalls Fascism 
Editor: 

On Election Day, I witnessed one 
of the most disturbing scenes I have 
ever seen on any campus since the 
civil rights movement in the 19605. At 
several locations around the UCSD 
campus I saw individual students and 
bands of anti-Dukakis people (111 call 
them Republicans) systematically 
roaming the campus, pulling down 
and feverishly tearing up all the 
Dukakis campaign posters they could 
find. The 1930's image of the bands of 
Nazis going through German st.r~ets 
and wiping out all traces of opposl~lon 
to Hitler immediately flashed IOto 
my mind. The similar scene at UCSD 
was sickening. 

What gives anyone the right to do 
this? Is this the new, kinder, gentler 
America that Bush speaks about so 
often? It is actually Fascism at its 
worst. God help UCSD. God help 
America. We need His help more 
than ever.

The Koala 
Editor: 

1 am writing in response to the stu-
dents' concern about the Koala (Nov. 
J I) losing its funding from the Asso-
ciated Students. I am delighted, as 
the Koala staff is I am sure, that many 
students are interested in keeping the 
Koala alive at UCSD. No need to 
worry: The Associated Students did 
not cut Koala funding and there is no 
intention of doing so. 

The Koala, being satirical as usual, 
printed the paper for the enjoyment 
of the students. The many phone calls 
we received the morning of the Koa-
la's publication had us in confusion. 
My job to inform the students of the 
truth was difficult if not impossible. It 
j ust goes to prove how much influ-
ence the print media has on the stu-
dents' minds. A spokesperson for the 
Koala, Mr. Grim, explained their 
action in this way: "We did it in

Yet, Wiescnthal would he the fint to tell you that 
Israel and the world should condemn such aotioaa,juat 
as the world and Germany have worked toptber to 
punish the Nazi war criminals. 

As I listened to Wiesenthal speak, I learned why he 
sinsJe-handedly brought many Nazi war criminals to 
justice. He wanted to bring his captors (the Nazis) to 
trial and show the world how one man can make the 
difference in punishing those who did such crimes . He 
standsasa man who should inspire each ofu todoour

Q ~nd A: What do you think about the closing of the Pub? 

ffeel that the Triton Pub is a 
landmark on this campus. 
Since the new Pub s going to 
be run by Round Table, that 
might change the way it s being 
run now. It 11 lose some of its 
aura moving to the Price Cen-
ter. It would be nice ifwe could

rm glad there are students out 
there that are willing to voice their 
opinion. The A.S. does not cen-
sor its media, as we believe in free

right direction of Jonathan 
ludaken's "revolution against 
stagnancy. " 

I heard through the grapevine 
that a student was going door-to-

to keep the Koala alive. I hope in 
the future that the editors of the 
Koala will inform the A.S. of 
their intentions in order to avoid

Voting Lines 
Are Too Long 
Editor: 

I wish to make a note of protest 
about the small number of polling 
stations on campus for the num-
ber of registered voters who live at 
UCSD. For several hours, the 
lines of people attempting to vote 
at the Revelle polling station 
exceeded 45 minutes. 

I heard of no one who voted off 
campus who was required to wait 
more than three minutes to vote, 

f think it sucks. The Pub s 
an institution at UCSD -its 
like home. It s a place where 
people can socialize, eat, maybe 
study at the same time . .. They 
serve alcohol al the faculty

A 

Box 
--No Consensus 

In Israel 
Editor: 

I was shocked and outraged to 
read the letter "Wiesenthallgnores 
New Genocide" (Guardian, Nov. 
I 0) . I marvel that the anony-
mous author labels Simon Wies-
enthal a critic when. by his own 
admission, he did not hear him 
speak and , pre umably. has never 
read anything he has written. The 
author's basic premise, which per-
vades the entire article, is that 
Mr. Wiesenthal represents the 
Israeli government and is thus 
somehow accountable for the 
Israeli government's actions. 

The attempt to equate the posi-
tions of Mr. Wie enthal with the 
positions of the Israeli goverment 
implies that all Jews are united in 
their support for all the policies of 
the I raeli government. ot only 
is this false (the recent ParLiamen-
tary election in Israel indicates 
that Israel citizens themselves 
cannot arrive at a consensus on 
the Palestinian question), but the 
very attempt to lump together all 

Jews and ascribe a particular trait 
to this mass is racist at its core. All 
blacks are not drug dealers; all 
Hispanics are not lazy; and all 
Jew do not upport the policies 
of the Israeli government. 

The author believes the Jews 
have lost the right to such moral 
appeals because of certain actions 
of the Israeli government. I find 

. the very attempt of the author to 
negate this message and to deni-
grate the six million deaths of the 
holocaust because of any actions 
of the Israeli government person-
ally insulting to myself as a Jew 
and as a human being. 

It is clear from the article that 
the author's true intent was to air 
his opposition to the policies of 
the Israeli government concern-
ing the Palestinians. I will better 
the author by not only stating a 
position, but by actually propos-
ing a means whereby a solution 
can be reached . Israelis and Pales-
tinians will settle their differences 
only when they remove stereo-
types and racism from the dia-
logue and agree to face each other 
with respect for each other's 
humanity.

A Question of Respect 
By RICK FORD 
Graphics Editor 

.. Rick. why don 't you use the 
female graphicfor your editor in 
a box?" 

" Whal ? No." 
.. Why not? I think that would 

be great." 
.. But, (with a nervous tone) I 

don i want to . .. 
"That s surprising ... lin kind 

of disappointed in you . .. 
" ... Because I don't want peo-

ple to think I am a 1I'0man . .. 
.. What do you care? What s so 

bad about women?" 

• 
I'm caught. In a three-minute 

conversation I have exposed the 
normally hidden chauvanism in 
myself. Actually, discovering it 
was surprising. I would normally 
co nsider myself open-minded, 
and I am in support of equality 
for women. But somehow, being 
mistaken for a woman startled 

me. 

I felt I would be losing some-
thing. What, I don't know. By 
gender, I am a male; however, 
being called a man embarasses 
me . Yet , if I respect women as I 
do myself, it shou ld not trouble 
me to be mistaken for a female. 

Either way, the conflict of 
women's growing equality has 
put new stress and increased 
tensions between the genders. 
For me, it eems there is a give-
and-take respect involved be-
tween males and females . 
A suming respect is a constant 
shared between genders, as one 
gain, the other relinquishe 
respect. I am not going to argue 
a bout who deserves it . It's 
obvious that women deserve at 
least equality. However, the 
transition from subordination 
to equality is a rough one. The 
women I know are trying hard 
to receive equal respect. 

As for myself, I am trying to 
give equal respect. Yet it seems 
to me that the history of my 

gender plays a heavy role in the 
transition. Today I am giving up 
respect I could take. It would be 
easier to maintain sexist stan-
dards. By refusing to respect 
others I could keep more for 
myself. I could keep a sense of 
superiority. Correcting the 
inequality is a sacrifice that 
causes insecurity. I have to 
unlearn attitudes I was brought 
up to have, and when I take 
away what I stood on, how can I 
stay standing? 

How can I respect women 
without considering myself 
weak? Someone could reply, 
"Would I not be stronger because 
I can give respect?" I don't know; 
that is a good question. 

I don't know how to answer 
my insecurities. And I still believe 
in equality for women. How-
ever, I see a conflict that could 
be around for a while, and as we 
fill the planet with human 
beings the question of respect 
will become increasingly 
important.

Airport Shuttle to Offer Holiday Rides 
Store Hours: 

By YURI WON 
Guardian Inlern 

A pilot program offering stu-
dents rides from campus to Lind-
berg Field and back to campus 
will be put into effect this 
Thanksgiving holiday using the 
UCSD shuttle buses. Sponsored 
by the A.S. and Transportation 
Services, the program is tenta-
tively known as the "Airport 
Shuttle. " 

The program was introducea 
last year by Third College Fresh-
person Senator Gayatri Gun-
asekaran, .w!to found it "im-
mensely difficult to find a ride"to 
the airport over the November 
holiday, the alternative prospects 
being either too costly or unsafe. 

"If I hadn't had a friend [to give 
me a ride] I would have been in 
dire straits, K she said . 

After some research, Gunasek-
aran proposed the airport shuttle 
program to the A.S. and Trans-
portation Services, who then 
looked into it and ultimately 
funded the program during spring 
quarter of last year. 

"I thought this was somethi ng 
we really needed ," said Gunasek-
aran, who added that people she 
had spoken to about the shuttle 
shart:d her enthusiasm. 

The program now, however, is 

portation Service] budgeted it 
for Christmas and Easter; how-
ever, if students don't use it, it 
won 't be funded ." 

The shuttle will transport stu-
dents from the Peterson Hall 
parking lot to Lindbergh Field on 
Wednesday, Nov. 23 approxi-
mately everyone and a half hours , 

and transport them back on Sun-
day, Nov. 27. 

In order "to make things as 
efficient as po sible," students 
wishing to use the shuttle mu t 
make reservation by calling 534-
RIDE. The last day to make 
reservations is Nov. 21. The fare , 
for now, is free . 

Kripke Loses to Lowery 
By DEBORAH McCREA 
COnlribuling Writer 

UCSDprofessor Daniel Kripke 
was defeated in the Nov. 8 elec-
tion when he received 31 percent 
of the vote for the position of 
congressman in the 41 st Congres-
sional District . The Democratic 
candidate lost to the RepUblican 
incumbent Bill Lowery. 

Kripke, a professor at UCSD's 
School of Medicine, is also direc-
tor of the Sleep Disorders Clinic 
at the Veteran's Administration 
Hospital. 

Several of Kripke's colleagues 
at UCSD expressed admiration 
for Kripke's courage to run against 
an incumbent in spite of the fact 
that incumbents have tended to 
win a wide majority of recent 
House elections. 

"He wanted to make a stand," 
stated Revelle College founder, 
Dr. Roger Revelle. "We must 
have somebody standing up for 
what is right." 

"It would have been unrealistic 
to imagine a major upset for 
Kripke in such an entrenched 
Republican district," Dr. Paul 
Saltman of the UCSD Medical 
School said. 

Kripke said he is proud to 
stand up for such important issues 
as education and medical care, 
despite 'his election defeat. 

"It was a good year for Demo-
crats," he said, claiming that there 
are "many issues worth fighting 
for, we lost and won some. I'm 
proud to have taken part in the 
victory. " 

Although his plans for the elec-
tion in 1990 remain undecided , 
Kripke expects to continue his 
career at UCSD.

This is a response to the letter 

concerning the speech "The Mur-
derers Among Us" (GUDrdian, 
Nov. 10). 

I do not disagree with the author 
that there are genocides even 
during the present day. The recent 
experiences in Cambodia in particu-
lar, and perhaps also Ethiopia, 
Nigeria, and others fit the defini-
tion given by Webster's Dic-
tionary: "genocide n. The sys-
tematic killing of. or a program of 
action intended to destroy, a 
whole national or ethnic group."

the use of the word to include 
large scale casualties and dis-
placements caused by acts of war. 
While the destruction of entire vil-
lages et al is unfortunate and to 
be deplored , if such is genocide, 
then not only is Israel culpable, 
but 0 are probably a quarter or 
more of the nations in the U.N. 
starting with the U.S. followed 
closely by the U.S.S.R., Iraq, 
Iran, France, Saudi Arabia, Great 
Britain, etc. 

If the deaths of .w,OOO civilians 
during an invasion means geno-
cide, then a vast majority of the 
world's nations are guilty. If we 
expand further to include casual-
ties of police action to quell active 
rebellion, (i.e. the actions in the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip), then 
nearly every nation and a great 
many leaders have participated in 
gc;nocide. I think I make my point. 

The Arab countries surround-
ing Israel have at various times 
publicly, ostensibly on behalf of 
the Palestinians, pronounced their 
intention to push Israel into the 
sea. By this narrow definition, 
this is also genocide. There is 
limited capacity to toss incrimina-
tions back and forth. All sides are 
to some extent guilty and every-
one's hands are bloody. , 

Not only are we still generally 
unaware of systematic attempts 
at the destruction of national or 
ethnic groups, but even after 45 
years , we still do not understand 
what the term genocide means.

Seidman defended herself by

but I believe that the structural 
factors created the opportunity

Seidman was also asked about 
the number of whites in the new 
multi-racial unions. She replied 
that whites in the unions are 
"mostly intellectuals." 

But there are some white 
workers she said , and relayed the 
story of a strike by the multi-
racial unions to protect a white 
female union member who was 
being abused by others in the 
workplace. But she did not dispute 
their characterization as "non-

white unions with white intel-
lectuals. " 

Seidman surmised that, while 
South African unions lean toward 
ocialism rather than capitalism, 

they would prefer a mixed econ-
omy. 

"They're definitely not looking 
for a dictatorship of the proletar-
iat" she said . "They're concerned 
more with the control of mineral 
resources and with land redistri-
bution ." When asked to predict 
the future of South Africa, Seid-

said it is possible to foresee which

"The nationalist government will

The question and answer period 
that followed was more lively as 
audience members questioned 
different aspects of Seidman's 
argument. 

One questioner, not content 
with Seidman 's comparison of 
South Africa's situation with other 
newly industrialized nations such 
as Brazil and South Korea, asked 
if her theory explains the "Solid-
arity situation" in Poland. 

Seidman was reluctant to ad-
dress labor problems in socialist 
countries. 

"It's a fair question," the lec-
turer said, "but J hate to answer it. 
The parallels are obvious but the 
relationship between the [factory] 
ownership .. . and the workers is 
very different."

Flying Club Experiences Natural Highs 
By SETH SLATER 
News Edi/or 

I t would only be a brief flight between classes, sophomore Laurence Balter, president and 
founder of UCSD's Flyi ng Club, 
knew a s he strode on to the apron 
of Flight International's airfield 
in Palomar on a Friday afternoon 
with his three passengers. 

Despite his time constraints, 
the 19-year-old pilot seemed eager 
to be picking his way between 
small jets and propeller planes in 
iln effort to reach his Cessna 172 
Skyhawk, the 17-foot long prop 
plane he would be flying that day. 

Flying, Balter said, requires 
"attention to detail ," and , accord-
ingly, he commenced with a pre-
flight check of his aircraft. 

It is important , he said only 
half seriously, to "make sure there 

a re no big dents [and] no holes'" n 
the plane's surface. 

Balter also examined the craft's 
oil and fuel levels - "I love the 
smell of jet fuel ,"he said - before 
instructing his passengers to climb 
aboard . 

Balter then radioed the control 
tower to receive a last minute 
weather report and was given 
clearance for takeoff. 

"Now we go for it," Balter said, 
as he taxied down the runway. 

Below the smog and clouds, the 
day was chilly and overcast and 
rather mundane, but above them, 
at an altitude of about 4500 feet, 
Balter and his three passengers 
found warmth, brightness, and a 
little adventure. 

"That's an inversion layer," 
Balter said , explaining the cause 
of this dramatic change in weather 
a s he soa red over the hills of 
Palomar, vi ually canning the 

area in a search for the plane of 
flight instructor Calvin Jones 
which had taken off just minutes 
earlier. 

Balter and Jones had planned a 
mid-air rendezvous while still on 
the ground , and now Balter 
radioed his fellow pilot in order to 
plot a parallel course. 

Within moments of the radio 
transmission, Balter slid along-
side Jones' plane. The slower 
speed at which Jones was travel-
ing gave his plane the illusion of 
inaction and it seemed to hover 
against a mountain backdrop as 
Balter's passengers looked out the 
window. 

After a brief radio conversa-
tion, Balter dipped his left wing 
and Jones' plane resolved into the 
distance at the right. 

Balter, explaining flying prin-
ciples in general, said that parallel 
course flying is rarely done, and 

Parallel course flying is rarely done, according to Balter, and air traffic is not something pilots seek out.

California Assemblyman Tom 
i-tayden, will also address ethi-
cal problems tha t face students 
p\J r uing employment with com-
p~nies that have defense con-
tracts.

ethical ulUments surrounding 
the University's management of 
the Lawrence Livermore and 
Los Alamos laboratories remain. 

One ethical question Fredell 
posed to students was whether 
they could utilize their talents 
and knowledge to build nuclear 
weapons that may someday be 
used for destruction. 

Consequenm of Science 
"Our hope is only to provide a 

better understanding of the 
situation," Fredell said. "A scient-
ist's work has deep social and 
political conseque~s, yet stu-
dents are only trained in the 
technical aspects." 

Mike Nepomuceno, a gradu-
ate student in aerospace en-
gineering, said that working for 
a defense company is not at the 
top of his prio rity list. 

"I chose my profes~ion to 
design somethi ng that will ma\.. ..

Dr. MlIloud Simnad, who has 
worked with General Atomic, a 
laboratory devoted to peaceful 
use of nuclear energy, said the 
question raises a deep philoso-
phical dilemma. 

"I'd rather not spend my life 
designing weapons, however, 
some people are talented enough 
to do so, and they feel they're 
serving some purpose in doing 
it ," he said. 

"Nature has given us a choice." 
Simnad continued , "either to 
use atomic and nuclear energy 
for our protection or get 
destroyed by it." 

The UC system, which oper-
ates the Lawrence Livermore 
and Los Alamos National Labora-
tories under contract from the

air traffic is not something pilots 
seek out. Most of the 'time, he 
said, fliers feel an exhilarating iso-
lation while airborne. 

"It feels like the world is basi-
cally stopped and ... you're in 
your own little world [with] 
nobody there to bother you," Bal-
ter said. "You just enjoy the scen-
ery and it's beautiful. You're 
experiencing flight." 

Alan Gardner, the Flying Club's 
secretary general, said that flying 
gives a pilot three~imensional 
freedom, and expressed his enjoy-
ment of the rapid, long distance 
travel that flying permits. 

"You can fly, for instance, to 
Baja [California]," Gardner said, 
"and land on the beach, take a 
girlfriend with you and have a 
picnic, and then take off and 
come home." 

But flyiDi js Dot all footloose

how the performance of the air-
craft is," Balter said . 

Pilots must also contend with 
weather conditions, Gardner ex-
plained, pointing to the possibil-
ity of encountering air pockets 
(changes in air density), wind 
sheers (sudden changes in wind 
direction) and microbursts (nar-
row columns of rapidly descend-
ing air). 

The phenomenon of micro-
bursts is not yet fully understood, 
said Gardner, who likened a micro-
burst's wind pattern to "a small 
nuclear bomb exploding in mid-
air." 

The downdrafts caused by such 
an explosion would rebound 
upward after hittina the ground 
and would create wind patterns 
that a pilot might mistake for a 
headwind. The plane would in-
itially climb and decelerate before 
hittin, an area of "extreme" 
downdraft which would cause the 
craft to "descend like a rock."

The Che Cafe Plans Future 
By MA TIHEW SCOGGINS 
Contributing Writer 

The Che Cafe, reopened after a 
several month hiatus due to 
alleged health violations that came 
at the end of last year, is planning 
a new daily schedule that should 
go into effect next quarter, accord-
ing to Cafe core members. 

Both Student Center Director 
Jim Carruthers, who was respon-
sible for last year's shut down, 
and Che members agreed that the 
Cafe has made important strides 
in recent months. 

"They have moved toward a 
better standard of food produc-
tion. In ~y judgment they are 
successful, " Carruthers said. 

Core member Keith Abouaf 
explained that the Cafe has been 
holding frequent meetings. 

"We're in a building stage so 
we're cautious. We document 
everything," Abouaf said . 
. Most Fridays and Saturdays, 
the Che features live bands play-
ing music ranging from punk to 
folk and including reggae, rock 
and psychedelia. 

These events are often free, and 
cover charges never exceed six 
dollars.

money, we're establishing a small 
base we can use to grow with . 
Next quarter we plan on serving 
lunch five days a week from 10

The movement back to a regu-
lar schedule has been examined 
carefully. With the highly organ-
ized system that has been estab-
lished .and the support that has 
been provided by students, core 
members are confident they can 
expand to provide daily meals.

Nuclear . 
Weapons 
Continued from pale 10 

In the 195Os, UC scientists dis-
covered cost-efficient methods 
that resulted in the creation of 
nuclear bombs that could kill 10 
million people at a cost of 12 cents 
per death. These days have long 
disappeared in the face of loom-
ing production and maintencnace 
costs. 

Vince Ruddy, a UCSB gradu-
ate and engineer at General Dy-
namics, said that it is disturbing 
that the University was cast in the 
role in the fint place and that it is 
unethical for an academic institu-
tion to be involved with weapons. 

.. Although a global nuclear 
holocaust has not yet occurred, 
many see preparina for this 'crime' 
as an immoral endeavor, espe-
cially for an institution of hisher 
education. " 

Federal Fundinl 
Critics of the UC's relationship 

with the labs say UC scientists use 
the UC's name and academic rep-
utation to acquire federal fundina 
for nuclear weapons projects and 
support for partisan issues. 

In a letter to a colleague this 
year, Hayden charged that lab 
officials have consistently lobbied 
aaainst a comprehensive nuclear 
test ban treaty. 

Experts believe the treaty, 
which calls for the superpowers to 
cease all nuclear testing, is the 
most important step in ending the 
nuclear arms race, and will effec-

collectively. Two, is to provide 
hot and cold natural health foods 
that are vegetarian, and three, is 
to provide an alternative social, 
cultural and political format [for 
students]. "

Flying Club Gets Off the Ground 
Continued from page 10 
a spccial feeling of pride for a 
pilot upo n the successful comple-
tion of a flight. 

"Essentially, you're a captain of 
a vessel a nd when you get back 
down, you make it. You get to 
your destination and you've con-
quered all the e different road-
blocks . You really get a sense of 
accomplishment." Balter said . 

The Flying Club ha also had 
accomplishments on the grou nd , 
Balter pointed out , as he spoke 
about some of the cl ub 's past 
activities and upcoming event . 

After circulating the necessa ry 
petitions, the clu b succeeded in 
e tabli hing Aviation 140, a pri-
vate pilot ground school cou rse 
offered on cam pus for UC credit. 
Balter hopes to int roduce a flight 
instrumentation course soon. 

In the past, the club has partici-
pated in rallies that combine car 
and airplane racing and has taken 
tours of Miramar's "Top Gun" 
school for naval fighter pilots. In 
addition, the club schedules speak-
ers involved with various aspects 
of the aerospace industry to lec-
ture on campus. 

Upcoming events that are still 
in the planning stages include 
flights to mountain resorts for 
weekend skiing, an Aviation Aero-
space Day at UCS D which Balter 
hopes will be attended by repre-

AI04 

sen tatives from about 30 aero-
space companies and agencies. 
and a banquet at the soon-to-be 
completed Univer ity Center. 

"San Diego has grown so much 
and the aviat ion community is 
really expanding," Balter said . 
"We've always got something 
going on. It's a lot of fun and it 
opens a lot of doors for a lot of 
people," 

According to Balter, the airline 
industry is expected to experience 
a hiring boom within the next five 
to ftfteen years. and is conse-
quently beginning to look toward 
civilian pilots as a possible labor 
source. 

"The airlines have expressed a 
lot of interest [in the club's activi-
ties]," Balter said, explaining that 
he has received letters from sev-
eral commercial airlines, includ-
ing United and Delta, 

Gardner said that he has been 
offered several aviation-related jobs 

Physical Education 
My first time tutoring was a night 

to remember. My student was some-
thing ca lled Bone Crusher Reed ~ a.k.a. 
Bi IIV Jo~ defen ive tack Ie for the foot-
ball team. 

I had the shock of my life when 
he answered his dorm room door. 
He was about six foot seven ... in 
diameter. And when he shook my 
hand , I thought Itlne\'cr get it back. 

So there I wa ,face-to-knee with 
the big man on campus, wondering 
how I was going to relate American 

Literature to The Hulk. 
But then he pulled out a can of 

Orange Cappuccino. I was shocked! 
Could it be that this tough jock 

liked its delicate taste? And when 
Bone Crusher brought out the bone 

china, I was beyond belief. 
Read i ng the expression on my 

face, he said, "What can I say? I like it. 
The Cafe Francais is pretty good, 
too," Well , who's going to argue, I 
thought. As we Sipped our Orange 
Cappucci no, I discovered that Billy Jo 
loves readi ng novels; his only problem 

wa~ poetry. So I gave him tip on 
readll1g Emi ly DICkinson, and he 
gave me a copy of Ann Beattie'!> 
"Fa lling in Place." 

All I cou ld think was, Dad' never 
going to believe t hi s! 

General Foods International Coffees. 
Share the feeling. 

on the basis of his flying experien-
ces, including a position as an 
a vionics engineer wit h one corpo-
rat ion and a job in aircraft resto-
ration with the Smithsonian 
Institute. 

Despite the club's interests in 
the aerospace industry, Balter said 
hobbyists are welcome additions 
to the club's membership. 

"More than half our club 
[members] are oriented just 
[toward] hobby flying," he said, 
explaining that club members 
qualify for flying discounts that 
make their hobby considerably 
less expensive. 

Some aviators fear that changes 
in the aerospace industry in recent 
years threaten the more casual 
and romantic aspects of flying, 
but Balter still enjoys taking pas-
sengers up to view sun'sets and full 
moons, To him, such flights are 
scenic and beautiful. 

"The roma nce is still there," he 
said, "I feel it."

Pacific Beach 
The Merchants of Pacific Beach recently 
became painfully aware (through exten~ 
sive pollings and surveys) that well over 
600 UCSD Tritons do not frequent their 
establishments. 

While the other 15,400 are familiar 
with Pacific Beach's incredible night life, 
eateries, clothing shops and generally wild 
nature, some Tritons have yet to fully 
explore Pacific Beach. 

Chances are you've already consumed 
sumptuous seafoods at Hana Seafood or 
TOGO's monumental sandwiches and 
most of you have stopped in for a haircut 
at Ralph's Hair Place, However, if you 
haven't stepped out of the dark, let's do it! 
Quality people and quality service 
UCSD and Pacific Beach. 

The Promenade 
Imagine. You're sampling our delectable 
gourmet fast foods while seated in view of 
the beautiful Pacific . The sun shines, the 
waves rumble, it's time. 

Yes, it 's time to shop! Do you need 
sunglasses?; the perfect gift?; jewelry per~ 
haps? Or maybe a new shirt or surfboard! 
All designs are on the cutting edge. 

Fun, sun and food on the run (and

of weapons. 

"If you had ajob at one of those 
labs, you would try to do any-
thing you can to make sure fund

i ng , ~ Ruddy said . 
Oversicht Procedures 
Hayden authored budget legis-

lation that called for more money 
to go to the revamping of over-
sight procedures. His actions were 
in response to concerns that lab 
officials lobbied again t the test 
ban treaty, oversold the "Star 
Wars" project to Congress and 
terminated a Department of 
Energy investigation of drug use 
a t the Livermore laboratory. 

An opponent of Hayden' view, 
Dr. William Frazier, senior vice 
president of academic affairs de-
scribed the legislation as "intru-
sive and inappropriate.-

UC spokesperson Mike las-
iter said that UC Regents Presi-

dent David Gardner will present 
his first report on the oversight 

procedure on Nov. 18 at UC 
Irvine. 

Lab Scandals 
According to an article in the 

Bulletin 0/ Atomic Scientists, 
faculty at UC Santa Cruz passed 
an academic senate resolution in 
1983 that called for UC to break 
its ties with the labs. The resolu-
tion stated that it is not "part of 
the University's mission to be 
involved in the design and devel-
opment of weapons." 

Lab scandals that have made 
headlines in the media include 
allegations that UC scientists 
lobbied again tthe much heralded 
"Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty" 
and the charge that lab officials 
oversold the "Star Wars" project 
to the Pentagon. 

"Star Wars" 
The "Star Wars" fiasco which 

caught nationwide attention fo-
cused on the allegation that the 
project was prematurely sold to 
the Reagan adminstration because 
of one scientist's hope for per-

..• . ... . i .RECKER 

FEATURES 
sonal recognition. 

Livermore lab scientists Roy 
Woodruff said that in 1983, 
Edward Teller. associate director 
emeritus of the lab. told President 
Reagan that the x-ray laser was 
"entering the engineering pha e," 
when in fact basic research had 
not yet been completed. The laser 
is the k.:y component of "Star 
Wars" (officially known as the 
Strategic Defense Initiative or 
SOl). 

During this period, a majority 
of top level physicists around the 
country igned a boycott on SOl, 
stating that the project was not 
ready to be produced and proba-
bly hould not have been deve-
loped to begin with. 

University Endorsement 
Opponents charged that with-

out the backing of the UC's name, 
SOl, a defense system that theo-
retically would provide an um-
brella of protection against 
nuclear attack, would have never 
received federal support. 

Ruddy said that SOl was a 
blatant example of UC scientists 
coming down on the side of a par-
tisan issue that clearly represented

"Here we are five to six years 

later and westill haven't been able 
to determine whether it works or 
not ," Ruddy said. "The only rea-
son it wa sold to Congress was 
becau e the UC name endor ed 
it. .. 

Sim'nad said that the motive 
behind the project is commenda-
ble, and that questions of whether 
SOl will work or not are still 
debatable. 

"It's hard for engineers and 
scientists to say that ~omething i 
impossible when we've landed 
peol\le on the moon," he said. 
"The~inofffrom this might lead 
to other technical and scientific 
adva nces." 

The Recents Criticized 
Critics of the UC claim the 

Regents have been "dragging their 
feet," and have shown ignorance 
in addressing the issues. 

Lassiter said that despite alle-
gations that the UC should not be 
involved with weapons research, 
h.wing the institution run the labs 
provides an opportunity for op-
ponents to voice disagreement and 
promote discussion tha t would 

The UCSD Guardian 

not exist under the autonomous 
rule of a private company. 

Public Service 
"The University [Ue] has op-

erated the labs since the I 940s. 
We do not do it for our glorifica-
tion or monetary gain, but merely 
a a public service," Lassiter said. 

According to Lassiter, the UC 
does not decide what projects are 
to be worked on, but serves as an 
overseer to ensure the best quality 
of research . 

Critics of the UC claim the 
Regents have shown indifference 
to repons of the impropriety of 
scientists' cond UCI. 

"The Regents have not made a 
comment on that," Lassiter said. 

512 Million Contra ct 
The U C system recei ved a $ 12 

million contract to manage the 
laboratories for five years. The 
cont ract was renewed in Sep-
tember of 1987 and will not come 
up for consideration again until 
1992.

knowledge, and those aged 18 to 24 came in last. The survey tested 10,820 adults in Canada, France, Italy, Japan, 
Mexico, Sweden, the United Kingdom, West Germany, and the United States. Overall, the U.S. ranked below 
Sweden, West Germany, Japan, France, and Canada, and was on a par with the United Kingdom. 

To celebrate National Geography Awareness Week, November 13-19, Fifth College and ASUCSD are sponsoring 
a self test of the toughest questions. We chalJenge you to take the test and participate in the week's schedule of events.

Swim 
Continued from page 22 
First, Michelle Steinberger sailed 
through the lOO-meter fly, land-
ing at I :03.04. Then it was Joan 
Macaulay stroking it hard to the 
wall , touching out Northridge by 
just .25 seconds at a time o( 
1:02. 17. Finally, Jenna Banaszek 
reached for victory at 5: 12.66 in 
the 500-meter freestyle. Banaszek 
had not expected to swim as fast 
as she did on Saturday, but she 
said that she "hoped to win and 
get some points for the team." 

The Triton men continued to 
dominate Northridge, grabbing 
first place finishes in their final 
two event~. Doug Schmidt glided 
to victory with a 1:01.77 in the 
lOO-meter breast, and then four 
Tritons, Dave Delatto, Josh Har-
ris, Steve Denys and team captain 
Rick Daniels 'put together a win-
ning rally to finish off Northridge 
with a 3: 13.26 in the 400 meter 
freestyle. 

The victory was sweet for the 
men's team, avenging last year's 
loss to Northridge. And even 
though the women lost , it was not 
a setback. They came· 16 points 
closer to Northridge this year and 
feel confident about the rest of the 
season. 

Assistant coach Eric Vitcenda 
was excited with the team's over-
all performance. "We have a new 
attitude this season. We're think-
ing like a Division I school. It's 
hard to compete with scholarship 
teams like Northridge, but we 
do ... with a great deal of success. " 

With Northridge gone, the 
Tritons forecast blue skies ahead . 
Saturday, Nov. 19 at 10 a .m. the 
Tritons host UCSD relays at the 
Canyonview Pool.

Continued from plge 26 
Klintworth and senior Dee Dee 
Bigelow led the attack, compiling 
9 and 13 kills respectively, while 
sophomore Rachel Vetter and 
Becky Palmer finished off the 
scoring with six kills apiece. Many 
of Vetter's spikes hit the floor 
before the Sagehens even had 
time to react, to the delight of the 
near-capacity crowd. 

The second game brought no 
relief to the helpless Sagehens, 
UCSD once again dominating 
with Bertanyi and sophomore 

• Dana Simone adding insult to 
injury with two serving aces each. 

Sensing an easy win, the Triton 
women confidently executed their 
game, all the time smiling after 
awesome kills by Vetter, BigelOW, 
and Klintworth. 

Following the 15-3 second 
game, the Tritons built up a 9-3 
lead after Vetter took complete 
control of the game with well-
placed hard spikes, and then 
cruised to a 15-9 win .

Continued from page 28 
though the game would become a 
hard-fought defensive battle as 
both teams effectively checked 
their opponents attacks. Then, 
the magic of Nguyen struck again. 
Taking a pass from Mike Kappes, 
he beat one defender to the end 
line before slipping a shot past the 
goalkeeper to give the Tritons a 
2-1 lead. 

Just before the half, Triton 
forward Scott Rommell scored 
the clincher on a great individual 
effort when he stole the ball on a 
goalie's pass and touched it into 
the open net. 

"Rommell's goal was a real 
killer; it really demoralized them 
at the end ofthe halfand we cal1}C 
out in the first ten minutes of the 
second half as up as we've been aU 
year," Bradley said . "That really 
got them down and they just ran 
out of gas in the second half." 

Four minutes into the second 
half, Greg Gross scored on a 
penalty from twenty yards out. 
From that point on, the game was

Triton swimmers then took to 
the pool, beginning their quest for 
tea m points. The I,OOO-meter 
freestyle proved to be a winning 
event for the Tritons. lenna 
Banaslek swam away with first 
place and a time of 10:44.32, 
while teammate Dave Sacco fol-
lowed with a winning time of 
10:00.31. 

Minutes laler, Steve Denys 
edged out Northridge swimmers 
in the 50-meter freestyle after only 
21.71 seconds. Shannon Smith 
kept the momentum going, ac-
cumulating more first place points 
for the men's team with a time of 
2:00.00 for the 200-meter individ-
ual medley. . 

Triton swimmers then turned 
the pool over to the divers, who 
continued competition on the 
three-meter board . Osgood and 
Ortiz retained control of the top 
two spots. Ruth Prange, mean-
while, dove into third place for 
the women. 

Triton diving coach Tom Scotty 
was not surprised by the outcome. 
"We're a young team going 
through lots of change . They're 
learning a lot, and that doesn't 
come through in the meets." 

UCSD swimm.: rs returned fired

It's never been difficult for students to convince 

their parents of the need for a Macintoshfll computer 
at school. 

Persuading them to write the check, however, is 
another thing altogether. 

Which is why Apple created the Student Loan·to· 
Own Program. An ingenious loan program that makes 
buying a Macintosh as easy as using one. 

Simply pick up an application at the location 
listed below, or call BOO·83 I· LOAN. All your parents

There's no collateral. No need to prove financial 

hardship. No application fee. 
Best of all, the loan payments can be spread over 

as many as 10 years.

Which gives you and your parents plenty of time 
to decide just who pays for it all.

At this point , neither team 
seemed to want to take control, as 
indicated by an eternity of sideouts 
at the end of long rallies. Eventu-
ally, La Verne strung consecutive 
serves together and streaked to a 
14-8 lead . The Tritons fought off 
five game points, and scored four 
in the process, primarily due to 
Rachel Vetter's offensive fire-
power, before losing 15-6. 

"It was an outstanding, com-
plete leam victory. We were solid 
in all aspects. Everybody contrib-
utes, that's why we're better," 
Coach Dannevik stated proudly 
afterward . 

"I have to hand it to the play-
ers. They're the best. They do 
everything they're trained to do 
and they do it well." 

Heading into Nationals, UCS D 
possesses the worst record, 32-8, 
of the four teams. They play 
Juniata, 42-6, and the other match 
pits Illinois Benedictine, 35-5, 
against Wisconsin Whitewater, 
57-2, 

"We have a legitimate chance 
of winning if we play like we did 
tonight. We control our destiny 
by how hard we work," Dannevik 
added.

Triton Head Coach Doug Dannevik mentioned Pomona-
Pitzer game that he doubted any of the teams in the Regional could 
play tough against his. for more than an hour. He was right. 

game. As a matter of fact, the 
only reason the game lasted over 
an hour was because Pomona 
Head Coach Pam Hanzlick called 
five or six time outs in an effort to 
prolong her team's misery - and 
perhaps help the concessions stand 
do more business. 

In the first game, all that the 
San Diego squad had to do was 
serve the ball and watch the 
Sage hens foul up. Misplaced hits 
to the roof, the stands, a nd the net 
gave UCSD a quick 3-0 lead 

. 

which they would never relinquish 
on the way to a 15-6 score. 

Thanks to incredible passing 
from sophomore setter Laurie 
8ertanyi (34 assists), several 
UCSD players were routinely set 
up for easy spikes right down the 
throats of the hapless Sagehens. 

The Tritons' outside hitters, for 
the third time this season, used 
the passing of Dertanyi to destroy 
Pomona-Pitzer as they totaled 37 
kills in 92 attempts. Junior Diana

Women 's Soccer Suffers First Loss in Title Game 

UCSD Ousted in Sudden Death, 1-0 
By PHIL GRUEN 
Sports Editor 

Victories - and hutout - have 
become so commonplace for the 
UCSD women's soccer team this 
year that it began to seem in-
evitable that the Tritons would win 
every time they stepped onto the 
field. Until yesterday. 

After edging Ithaca College 2-0 
in overtime the day before in the 
semifinals, UCSD could not 
perform their victory and shutout 
magic in the NCAA Division III 
National Finals a they fell to 
William Smith College of New 
York 1-0 when Rachel Haaland 

scored one minute into the sudden-
death overtime. The Tritons 
finished second in the Nation 
with a 20-1-2 record, and William 
Smith concluded with an 18-1-1 
record and the National Title. 

On Saturday, junior Heather 
Mauro scored twice during the 
two 15 minute overtimes to propel 
the Tritons into the National 
Final. Mauro's goals came off 
passes from Karin Lindsay and 
Susan Kramer. Junior goalie Julie 
Freiss put another shutout, the 
18th, under her belt. It would be 
her last. 

Until Sunday's contest, the 
Tritons had collected shutouts in 

each of their post-season games, 
including the two Regional games 
la t weekend in Minnesota. 
William Smith earned the right to 
face the Tritons by defeating 
Methodist College of North 
Carolina, 2- 1. 

Despite losing, the UCSD 
women's soccer team compiled 
their best-ever record this year -
and before this weekend, had 
never finished higher than third in 
the Nation. With nearly all of 
their players returning, the Tritons 
have an excellent chance to get 
right back into the National Final 
next season and avenge this year's 
defeat. 

Women's Volleyball Sweeps 
Through West Regional 
By DANA CHAIKEN 
and CHRIS ZAHARIAS 
Staff Writers 

Prior to Friday's We t Regional match against 
Pomona-Pitzer Triton women's volleyball head 
coach Doug Dannevik stated that he doubted 
whether any of the teams could play tough against 
his team for more than an hour. As the Tritons ' 
whipping of Pomona-Pitzer (3-0) and La Verne 
(3-1) showed this weekend , the teams found it 
hard to stand up to UCSD's flawles play for one 
minute - let alone sjxty. 

Peter Meurobian/ Guardian 

Junior Diana Klintworth spent a pleasant weekend 
driving spikes into the opponent (24 kills in all). 

The Tritons will host the Nationals beginning 
Friday when they host Juniata College in a 7:30 
p.m. contest. The other two teams in the National 
are Illinois Benedictine and Wisconsin White-
water, and they will square off at 5:00 p.m. 

Dramatic. Exciting. Close. Those are words 
that should have described the title match of the 
Division III West Regional between UCSD and 
the University of La Verne Leopards before it was 
played on Saturday night. The stage was set, but 
the Tritons blitzed by La Verne in four games to 
advance to the NCAA Division III Nationals. 

"Outstanding. Solid. Complete, "were the words 
Dannevik used to expre s how his charges played 
in a 15-0, 15-5, 12-15, 15-6 vIctory that did not 
match up to its pre-game billing. 

In the final game of the season series between 
these two teams (the Leopards swept the Tritons 
in the first match of the year, and were the only 
DiviSion III team to beat the defending cham-
pions in the last three years), UCSD was "up," 
mentally and literally, during the entire first game. 
Even with the two starters on the bench for disci-
plinary reasons, the Tritons allowed the Leopards 
only four sideouts, and a bagel on the scoreboard. 

Against the Tritons'usual startin~ .six. ~ Ve~ne 
tallied its first points of the evenmg, JumpIng 
out to a 3-0 lead in the second game before UCSD 
kicked into gear to not only catch up, but lead 8-3. 
The Leopards leaped back in momentarily, scor-
ing two points after a timeout , but UCSD capital-
ized on their opponents' errors and strong offen-
sive play from Diana Klintworth to run out the 
game uncont~ ted . The Tritons carried their 
momentum into the third game jumping to a 5-1

UCSD Swimmers Split vs. Northridge 
Men Win, Women Lose in Saturday's Meet 

By CARIN RESNICK 
Staff Writer 

With no clouds in sight Satur-
day morning, UCSD swimmer 
and divers relied on sheer talent 
and team spirit to cool off their 
oppbnents, Cal State Northridge. 
CSUN, the defending NCAA 
Division II Champions, out hined 
the UCSD women's team 139-
\02, but took a beating from the 
men, 136-96. 

The first intercollegiate meet of 
the sea on began with a plash a 
divers took to the one-meter 
board. Here, UCSD diver Dan 
o good and Alfonso Ortiz ca p-
tured fir t and econd place for 
the men , while athi Wood 
claimed third for the women.

Men's Soccer Heads to Nationals 
UCSD Takes Care 
of Emory U., 4-1 
By BRIAN ITOW 
Staff Writer 

The fourth-ranked Triton men's 
soccer team (21-0-2) ended the 
dreams of cinderella Emory 
University in a NCAA Division 
III Quarterfinal soccer match with 
a relatively easy 4-1 victory 
Sunday afternoon at Warren 
Field. 

Even though Emory pulled off 
two major upsets en route to the 
Quaterfinals, they could not make 
it three. The Tritons will face 
Messiah College of Pennsylvania 
in the first round ofthe Nationals 
next weekend at a site to be 
named later. 

Accustomed to scoring right 
off the opening kick-off, the 
Tritons were held scoreless for the 
first twelve and a half minutes. At 
12:39 into the game, Thien Nguyen 
beat two defenders to the left 
corner and hit a cross in front of 
the goal that Mike Bradley hit 
into the back of the net for the 
first score. 

Just fifty seconds ' later, the 
Eagles answered the Triton goa\. 
On a free kick from twenty-five 
yards out, Scott Cahoon hit a 
shot past UCSD goalkeeper Greg 
Stadler to tie the game at one and 
silence the crowd of 650. 

UCSD head coach Derek 
Armstrong said, .. It was a beauti-
ful goal. When they hit one like 
that, all you can do is sit back and 
clap. It put them right back in the 
game." 

From that point, it seemed as 
See M. SOCCER, pale 22 

Scott Rommel! (6) scored a goal 
which put the game in the bag for 
the Tritons. The crowd (back -
ground) numbered around 650.
