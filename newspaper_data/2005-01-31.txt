Eatery inspections overhauled 
Department declines to release grades 

Billy WonfIGuonion 
Food checb: Under new inspections criteria fof campus eateries established by environmental inspector Danyl Vorkey/ the Che 
Cafe (abolle) has been asked to install a new three-compartment sink. according to University Centers Director Gary Ratdiff. 

By AMY IFURUNG 
Staff Writer 

The campus' new health 
inspector has scrapped UCSD's old 
campus eateries inspection process 
in favor of a new system that will 
assign letter grades to vendors. 
However, several restaurants have 
expressed concerns over the way 
the method is being implemented. 

The criticism has targeted eatery 
inspections conducted by Darryl 
Yorkey, a registered environmental 
'health inspector previously 

employed by San Diego County, 
whom the university's Department 
of Environment, Health and Safety 
hired in September. 

"We've been able to make 
quite a few changes at lightning 
speed," Yorkey said, referring to a 
new inspection form and a letter-
grading system. 

The old inspection format used 
by the university did not incorpo-
rate provisions of a new law passed 
in 2000, according to a Gum-dilm 
analysis published last February. 

For some campus food facili-

ties, however, the updated inspec-
tion and grading system has 
resulted in lower scores on quar-
terly health inspections. 

The deparonent will post let-
ter grades for public viewing after 
the winter quarter inspections 
take place. 

"Knowing that this is a pilot 
program, we're going to hold off 
posting these grades until they're 
high," said Bruce Bowers, envi-
ronmental health and safety spe-

Hackers breach Extension computers 
By IENJAMIN IARTLDT 

Staff Writer 
Campus administrators detect-

ed a low-level breach of comput-
ers within the UCSD Extension 
network, which has stored more 
than 4,800 files of students' per-
sonal information. 

"This was a very unfortunate 
incident," UCSD Extension 
Marketing Director ' Monica 
Doyle said. "Universities are get-
ting hacked into all the time now 
- that's why it's important we 
have really good security." 

A university investigation into 
the breach, which administrators 
discovered on Nov. 6, revealed 
that backers did not access any of 
the files on affected computers. 
The files contained full names, 
social security numbers and credit 
card infonnation for students and 
alumni, 

"This breach was used to 

store music and DVDs," Doyle 
said. "There is no evidence that 
any personal records were 
accessed." 

Pursuant to state law, adminis-
trators notified individuals affect-
ed by the breach of the incident 
and advised them to place fraud 
alerts on their credit cards to 
avoid identity then. The law 
requires companies and state 
agencies to notify individuals if 
their personal information is elec-
tronically compromised. 

Although the breach occurred 
more than two months ago, 
administrators did not send notifi-
cation letters until the first week 
of January, after the investigation 
concluded. 

"It was a tedious, painstaking 
operation to go from computer to 
computer to make sure there were 
no more infections," Doyle said. 

. "We waited to send notifications 
until everyone [affected] had been 

identified." 
The breach most likely 

occurred through the desktop, 
where somebody using the com-
puter unknowingly downloaded 
an automated "bot," which then 
launched files designed to steal 
hard-drive space, according to 
Doyle. 

Since the incident, UCSD 
Extension has accelerated the 
application of the recently updat-
ed network security policy, creat-
ed to strengthen both hardware 
and software systems on campus, 
Doyle said. 

These changes include patch 
updates, anti-virus software 
upgrades, host-based firewall soft-
ware and the elimination of unau-
thenticated e-mail relays and 
proxy services. 

This is the third incident at the 
campus in which hackers have

Study: Approved stem 
cell lines contaminated 

By USAMAK 
Associate News Editor 

Al l existing embryonic stem-cell 
lines, including those approved for 
federal funding, are contaminated 
wi th a non-human molecule that 
compromises their usefuln ess in 
studying treatments for human dis-
eases, according to a study by 
researchers from UCSD School of 
Medicine and the Salk Institute. 

In a study published Jan. 23 in 
Nature Magazille, researchers 
found that these stem-cell lines 
contain a sialic acid called N eu5Gc, 

a molecule that human cells are 
unable to produce. T heir findings 
concluded that stem cells incorpo-
rate the molecule when researchers 
grow them in laboratory cultures 
derived from animal materials. All 
traditional methods of growing 
human stem cells in dish cultures 
use animal-derived materia ls, such 
as mouse and calf serum. 

"With this discovery, the pre-
existing genera l concern about 
using animal products for deriving 
human embryonic stem cells has

1 BRIEFLY 
Exchange program violates 
law, State Department rules 

The us State Department has found that a 
private program for foreign students violates 
federal laws that cover student exchange ser-
vices. 

Prompted by an inquiry from the Service 
Employees International Union, the depart-
ment's review concluded that the exchange 
program run by American Pool Enterprises 
failed to provide "accurate information to the 
public when advertising [its] exchange visitor 
programs or responding to public inquiries:' In 
addition, as a subsidiary of a Canadian corpora-
tion, the department ruled the company did 
not meet u.s. citizenship requirements to 
administer summer work and travel programs. 

The company had applied to bring 2,500 for-
eign students into the country under the J-1 visa 
program, the union stated in a press release. 

Study cites cow belching as 
source of pollution 

Cow manure may not be as bad for 
California's air as previously thought, a first-of-
its-kind UC Davis study has found. In fact. cows, 
much maligned for their contribution of green-
house-effect-causing methane gas, actually 
produce only half the amount of the state's air 
pollution previously attributed to them. 

Perhaps most important, the majority of a 
dairy cow's contribution to smog comes not 
from her manure but from her belching, the 
university'S scientists said. 

"Our discovery means our whole approach 
to dairy waste management and air-emissions 
management might change; stated UC Davis 
air-quality specialist Frank Mitloehner, who con-
ducted the study. "For the most tightly regulat-
ed pollutants, the 700 ozone-forming gases 
collectively called 'volatile organic compounds: 
the source is not the cows' waste. It's the 
cows:' 

The study was to be presented to the 
California Air Resource Board at its Jan. 26 
meeting in Fresno, Calif.

Republican senator calls for 
increase in Pell Grants 

Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) has intro-
duced a non-binding "sense of the Senate" res-
olution calling for a ~450 increase in maximum 
Pell Grants for 2005-06. 

"The federal Pel! Grant has served as an 
established and effective means of providing 
access to higher education," the resolution 
states, urging lawmakers to raise the top award 
to ~4,500 . 

In addition, the resolution proposes that 
Congress include a provision in its upcoming 
reauthorization of the Higher Education Act to 
set the maximum Pell Grant at $9,000 . by 
award year 2010-11 - more than doubling the 
current ceiling of $4,050. 

Earlier in January, President George W. Bush 
proposed increasing the top award by $500 
over the next five years. 

The value of the grant has declined by 16 
percent since the mid-1970s, factoring in infla-
tion, and the portion of student aid covered by 
the award has fal len by more than half in the 
same period, the resolution stated. 

Controversial drug shown 
effective against alcohol use 

Ibogaine, a controversial hallucinogen, has 
proven effective in fighting alcohol cravings in 
rodents, UC San Francisco researchers have 
found . Previously advocated by some clinicians 
for use in treating human addiction, the drug 
may open the way for developing other drugs 
to reverse substance dependence, the findings 
state. 

Derived from a West African shrub, drug-
treatment advocates in other countries have 
long been using the drug for its ability to 
reverse withdrawal symptoms. However, recent 
evidence of its toxiCity to some nerve cells, as 
well as its popularity in the 1960s drug culture 
because of hallucinOgenic side effects, has dis-
couraged studies testing its efficacy. 

The report, published in the Journal of 
Neuroscience, is the first rigorous study of the 
drug's ability to treat substance abuse.

MONDAY, JANUARY 31, 2005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Food: System to seperate violation severity 
continued from page I 

cialist, who has conducted the 
food facil ity inspections. 

Employees at some campus 
food vendors said they had reser-
vations about the new system. 

The Food Co-op received a 
lerrer grade of "C" and a total of 
67 out of 100 points in a Nov. 16 
inspection under the new criteria, 
accordi ng to documents main-
tained at the facilities . Violations 
included a lack of hot water and 
health violations concerning the 
sanitation of consumer utensils. 

"The Food Co-op is getting 
deducted for a lot of little, strange 
things that don't seem to make 
sense," said Dana Dahlstrom, the 
Graduate tudent Association 
representative on the co-op over-
sight committee. 

Inspectors assi gn grades on a 
100-point scale, with the lowest 
grade of "C" assigned to totals of 
79 points and under. 

Yorkey said he had little con-
cern about the grades on fa ll 
health inspections. 

"There aren't any major issues 
here," Yorkey said. "Just as long as 
they are correcting their mistakes 
and not repeating them, then theres 
really nothing to worry about." 

Steve Benedict, director of 
environment, health and sa fety, 
aid that the new grading system is 

more comprehcnsi ve than the 
department's old methods. 

"vVhat food vend rs are wit-
nessing arc small changes in state 
law that we are taking care to 
implement," Benedi t sa id . "We 
are n't doing anything in excess. 
There are differences, but the pri-
mary measures of food safety 
haven't really changed." 

The department enforces state 
regul ations in the California 
Uniform Retai l Food Facility 

Laws, according to Benedict. 
"We tried to create a more thor-

ough, comprehensive system," 
Bowers said. "But also, we're just 
trying to get in line with the changes 
that have been made to CURFFL." 

New inspection forms include 
five major sections, classifying vio-
lations by gradations of severity. 
The first section, a list of "major 
violations," includes offenses like 
the failure of employees to wash 
hands and the presence of vermin. 

The new guidelines clas~ify 
bare hands in food preparation 
and empty soap devices as "minor 
violations," and list them in two 
subsequent sections. The remain-
ing two portions, which are not 
ca lcu lated into the 100-point 
total, are labeled as "administra-
tive violations" and "administra-
tive procedures and operator edu-
cation," respectively. 

T he forms present a list of 96 
separate items to examine, in con-
trast to the 3 3 items on the previous 
inspection form. The previous form 
consisted of two sections, labeled 
"equipment" and "methods," with 
no delineation of major and minor 
violations, as required by state law. 

Eateries have also voiced con-
cerns over the timjng of the evalua-
tions, which may occur at any time. 
Inspectors evaluated Ocea nView 
Terrace, which received a letter 
grade of "cn and a point total of 77 
on Dec. 14, when it was closed for 
winter break, according to enior 
manager Ralph Dauphin. 

"We were shut down and in 
cleaning mode at that point," he 
said. ","Ve should have been grad-
ed while we were open. Wouldn't 
that be a better indication of how 
we opera te?" 

Bowers said the departmen t 
understands the concerns, and is 
willing to work with vendors ro 

allay them. 
"We have such a good working 

relationship with our food facili-
ties, and we understand that a lot 
of it is out of their hands." he said. 
"We 're aware of that fact and we 
can work with them on that." 

In addition, the deparonent is 
concentrating more on the educa-
tional aspect of the inspections, 
working together with food ven-
dors to help them better under-
stand how to meet current health 
standards, Yorkey said. 

Despite vendor grumblillg, 
Benedict said he is confident that 
scores will improve. 

"Some of the things that lead to 
those grades can be changed very 
easily," he sa id . "With the upcom-
ing inspections, J'II be very sur-
prised if they are not all '/'\s." 

T he department declined to 
disclose scores of campus food 
facilities during the fall inspections, 
despite state statutes identifying 
the reports as public record . 
Instead, Yorkey suggested asking 
for copies maintained by individual 
food vendors, which the law 
requires them to present immedi-
atel y upon request w1der state law. 

Requests for inspection reports 
at several randomly selected eater-
ies, including Sierra Summit and 
Shogun, were turned down. 
Employees at the locations said 
either that the reports had been 
misplaced or that disclosure 
required the presence of a manager. 

T he GlIIlrdian sent a formal 
request for the reports to UCSD's 
Departmelll of Environment, 
Heal th and Safety pursuant to the 
California Public Records Act on 
Jan. 31. Under the law, the depart-
ment has 10 days to respond.

NEW 

Cells: Researchers discovered 
animal protein in growth serum 

continued from page I 
become more specific," the study'S 
senior author and professor of cel-
lular and molecular medicine, Ajit 
Varki, stated in a university 
announcement. 

Stem cells are specialized cell s 
in human embryos that can devel-
op into many different types of 
cells that form specific organs and 
tissues. Scientists hope to use these 
cells to develop tTeaonents for a 
variety of diseases, including dia-
betes and Alzheimer's. 

However, because humans have 
natural anti bodies against 
Neu5Gc, the study concluded that 
contaminated stem cells may be 
ineffective for possible therapeutic 
use in human subjects. 

T he team tried growing stem 
cells using methods that avoid ani-
mal contaminants, including using 
human-derived serum. When 
researchers grew cells in human 
serum with low amoW1.ts of Neu5Gc 
antibodies, it reduced the immune 
response, but did not eliminate it, 
the smdy stated. No known metl10ds 
exist to remove Neu5Gc completely 
from contaminated cells. 

" It would seem best to start over 
agai n with newly derived human 
embryonic stem cells that have 
never been exposed to any animal 
products," Varki stated. "However, 
such an approach could not be pur-
sued under existing rules for the 
use offederal grant dollars." . 

In 200 1, President George W. 
Bush restricted federal funding to 
srem-cell lines in existence at the 
ti me, citing moral and ethical con-
cerns over the use of human 
embryt.s for harvesting the cells. 

Proponents of human embry-
onic stem-cell research have used 
the new study to rally for e><panded 

federal funding, according to the 
Coalition of Americans for 
Resea rch Ethi cs, a group that 
opposes embryonic stem -cell 
research. 

"The reali ty is, there is reall y 
not much to this report at all as a 
justification for expanding govern-
ment fundi ng policy to include new 
[s tem-cell ) Jines," the group's 
Communications Director Gene 
Tame stated in an e-mail. "Rather 
than relying on scare tactics, pro-
ponents ... need to provide some 
really hard evidence that the effec-
tiveness of [stem cells] to provide 
safe and reliable therapies for 
humans is anything more than pure 
specula tion on a very distalll and 
increasingly unlikely proposi ti on." 

T he Nationa l Institutes of 
Health , which control fed eral 
stem-cell research funding, did not 
remm ca lls seeking comment.

Research focus neglectS undergrads 
By BIIAN UIGA 
Senior Staff Writer 

UCSD students are known for 
their whining skills. Whether the 
subject is parking, diversity enroll-
ment or the lack of a social life, you 
can expect top-notch non-substan-
tive arguments from La jolla's 
Finest. Yet, looking past UCSD's 
draconian alcohol policy or the 
reported liberal bias of a h\lmani-
ties professor, some legitimate 
questions about UCSD's integrity 
as an academic institution come 
through. 

Able-minded undergraduate 
students might wonder why thei r 
professors have no discernible 
teaching ski lls, or why upper-divi-
sion classes arc jnm-packed with 
150-plus students in what is sup-
posed to be the "13 th greatest 
University in the World." Other 
students might wonder why, in the 
midst of massive, crushing budget 
cuts, UCSD is building new engi-
neering buildings, while chemistry 
facilities are falling into disrepair 
and ruin. 

Former UCSD Chancellor-
turned-UC President Robert 
Dynes' remarks during the conelu-
ion of his statewide tour last week 

have finally settled this matter once 
and for all. After a few colorful anec-
dotes about the state of several near-
ly decrepit campus buildings, he 
dropped ·a bombshell about the 
University's plan for improving the 
state of higher education: continue 
to cut undergraduate programs and 
funnel the money into graduate pro-
grams instead. Dynes took an almost 
flippant view of undergraduates at 
UCSD, stating that ''We have actu-
ally been sacrificing the graduate 
programs to continue to meet the 
tidal wave of undergraduates. Now 
that thats going to level off." He 
spoke of undergraduate education as 
little more than a prerequisite to 

graduate level education. 
Of course, this attitude toward 

undergraduate education is nothing 
new. During the planning stages to 
create UCSD in 1960, several key 
figures, including UCSD's "godfa-
ther," Roger Revelle, fought to cre-
ate a graduate-only institution 
devoted entirely to science, as a 
satellite operation of the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography. Yet 
despite CWTent and past bias against 

undergraduates, UCSD administra-
tors must realize that they are oblig-
a ted to provi de a com petent cur-

ricu�um for undergraduates as well 
as graduates, and not rely on gradu-
ate programs to shoulder the bur-
den of actually educating students. 

An informal poll conducted by 
this author on the respective quali-
ties of undergraduate and graduate 
programs in the mechanical engi-
neering department found a dan-
gerous "competence gap" between 
senior-level undergraduates -and 
first-year graduates. By narrowing 
this gap in the MAE department 
and other departments, UCSD 
could provide a better quality edu-
cation for both those who stay 
through the graduate level and 
those who choose to enter the 
workforce or change schools after 
obtaining a bachelor's degree. 

But perhaps it is best to look at 
this from a business perspective, to 

see whether UCSD is wasting its 
time with undergraduate programs, 
or if the university should put the 
time and effort in to improve them. 
Instead, UCSD's name-recognition 
power comes primarily from its 
high rankings on various "best oP' 
college lists, and the school scored 
a major victory with its recent rank-
ing as 13th worldwide in academics 
and research, according to the 
Insti tute of Higher Education at 

Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Yet, 
according to U.S. News & World 
Repon, UCSD only ranks 32nd in 
the United States for its academic 
programs. 

This may not seem like a major 
discrepancy, but the fact that 
UCSD's academic programs rank 
far below its combined academ-
ic/research score confirms that 
which any self-respecting student 
already knows: UCSD's prestige 
rests solely on the shoulders of its 
research. 

If your school is riding on its 
research credentials, it makt'> per-
fect sense to ignore the quality of 
undergraduate education: After 
all, graduate schooling generally 
equates to doing grunt work on 
facul ty research projects, so why 
not have some well-trained lab 
assistants/graduate students to 
keep all of your research projects 
running smoothly? 

Yet why does the university feel 
the need to put in this "extra 
effort" on its graduate students, 
particularly those who were under-
graduates at UCSD? Why does the 
university need to play "catch-up" 
with these students, when a suffi-
cient undergraduate education 
would eliminate the need for such 
a crutch? Or, to put it more blunt-
ly, why is the university shooting 
itself in the foot by failing to train 
its undergraduates and then wast-
ing funding on excessively training 
its graduate students instead? 

The answer to this question 
mostly has to do with numbers of 
students. Despite the fact that effec-
tive undergraduate education would 
payoff by reducing the need for 
review in graduate courses, allowing 
for even more research time, the 
daunting "tidal wave" of undergrad-
uates presents a logistical nightmare 
for the university if it wishes to stray 
away from the "drive-thru degree" 
model and improve the quality of 
undergraduate work. True, the uni-
versity could increase its research 
output enormously by utilizing the 
untapped power of undergraduates 
in labs, but without an improve-
ment in the basic education of 
undergraduates, the university 
would soon see the foUy of under-
graduate lab training; under the 
current educational model, gross 
incompetence would rule the day. 

Yet, despite the logistical night-
mare it offers, the university must 
forge ahead and do something 
about the state of the undergradu-
ate education it offers. If the UC 
president is advocating cutting 
back on undergraduate education 
to divert even more time and 
resources into graduate progress, 
then the time to act is now. Before 
undergraduates are lowe.red even 
further on the pecking order, it is

Oversight committees could protect rights 
By DANIEL WArn 

Senior Staff Writer 

The recent delays and budget 
overruns in the construction of the 
University Centers Expansion -
paid for by student fees - have 
again made it clear that there are 
some serious problems with the way 
UCS D students' money is being 
handled. Weather-related problems 
are wlavoidable, but they provide 
an opportunity to more closely 
scrutinize how the rest of our fees 
are being spent. 

Built IO years ago, RlMAC was 
heralded as a necessary improve-
ment to the campus. A venue for 
concerts and events, and a world-
class athletics facility, RIMAC 
would put UCSD on the map and 
give a new home to our then-
Division m athletics. 

Ten years later, the $92 quarter-
ly fee that paid for its construction is 
still being assessed to every student, 
every quarter. 

Also completed more than a 
decade ago, Price Center was fund-
ed in part by a' $37.50 fee paid by 
every graduate and undergraduate 
student every quarter. As with the 
RlMAC fee, students still pay the 
$37.50 University Center fee three 
times per year. 

D espite the fact that students 
pay for Price Center, pay for 
RlMAC and will pay for the future 
expanded University Centers, they 
still do not have real control over 

them. Nor do they have any assur-
ances that the buildings will be run 
as intended, or that the administra-
tion won't come begging for more 
money later on. 

A large portion of Price Center 
office space, for example, is allocated 
to UCSD administrators and staff. 
Ask student organization leaders 
what they would like to see done 
with half of Price Center's second 
flooc. They will not say, "Give it to 
UCSD Catering and a couple of 
administrators." The building, paid 
for by the students, is not being used 
in the best interests of the students. 

nus, despite the fact that we 
have an allegedly student-dominat-
ed board running Price Center, 
Student Center and related entities: 
the University Centers Advisory 
Board. nus board is purely adviso-
ry, since University Centers 
Director Gary Ratcliff, among 
other administrators, has the power 
to overrule any UCAB action. He 
does not often overrule the board, 
but that is only because UCAB usu-
ally operates within parameters he 
finds acceptable. Should UCAB 
ever stray from the overarching 
vision of the administration, it 
would find itself dissolved, rendered 
irrelevant or overruled - as it did 
in the early 1990s, when it tried to 
fire its adviser and was summarily 
"de·established." 

UCAB is one of the primary 
examples of how undemocratically 
our fees are spent. UCAB's annual 

budget greatly exceeds that of the 
student government: Every quarter 
we pay $37.50 to UCAB, but only 
$21 to A.S. Council. With the 
income from the food vendors, the 
board's annual budget grows to a 
few million dollars. All this money, 
and not a single member of UCAB 
is directly elected by the students. 
Each college council and a couple of 
special-interest groups, like the 
Student Affirmative Action 
Committee, have a representative 
on the board, but the student body 
as a whole has no elected represen-
tatives. 

But at least students have some 
control over how the University . 
Centers Fee is spent. No similar 
"RIMAC Advisory Committee" 
gives input on the expenditure of 
the $92 quarterly RlMAC fee. 

The biggest problem with 
UCAB is its slowness to act. 
UCAB should make sure that 
Price Center businesses that profit 
from our student fees are follow-
ing the law and keeping their 
promises. 

When Panda Express originally 
moved to Price Center, it was sup-
posed to sell food by the ounce. A 
student · could walk into Panda 
with any amount of money in his 
pocket, and be able to buy at least 
some amount of food. nus Panda 
policy, advertised in the University 
Centers insert that often appears 
in the GflllrtUlIff, was one of the 
reasons Panda was chosen over 

other potential restaurants. Once 
moved in, however, Panda went 
back on its word, refusing to sell 
food by the ounce. Instead of sav-
ing students money, Panda 
Express now ranks as one of more 
expensive vendors in Price Center. 

Another violation is the com-
mon practice of charging a trans-
action fee for credit card purchas-
es under three or four dollars. It is 
an illegal violation of the mer-
chant's agreement with VISA. 
Most merchants apparendy don't 
read the agreement, since over-
charging is so widespread, but it 
clearly requires them to U Always 
treat VISA transactions like any 
other transaction; that is, you may 
not charge any surcharge on a Visa 
transaction." The agreement, 
available at brrp://flJII. villl.c_, 
dedares that "imposing minimum 
or maximum purchase amounts is 
a violation" of the merchant agree-
ment. Shogun imposes a transac-
tion fee, which ends up costing the 
student body thousands of dollars 
over the course of a year. It would 
be a small matter for UCAB to 
notify VISA of this vendor's non-
compliance. 

Some day, the administration 
will want to raise student fees 
again, to construct another build-
ing or refurbish existing ones. 
When that happens, students 
should think twice. Student-run 
oversight boards are only advisory. 
Fees do not disappear overnight.

L a Jolla - how fabulous! The sun, the surf, the fog, the sand in your bathing suit - it's 
close to paradise, isn't it? 

Except the city of La Jolla hates 
us, and when they're tired of hating 
us, they pretend we don't exist. They 
cringe at our youthful good looks, 
sneer at our backpacks and I-ronda 
Civics, and make violent stabbi ng 
motions whenever we venture with-
in 10 feet of them. Most of all , they 
hate our freedom. Don't have five 
month's worth of rent in your bar\k 
account, Sonny? Get the hell out. 

And why shouldn't they feel this 
way? We tutor their kids, wait on 
them at restaurants and rent their 
apartment buildings. By golly, we're 
damn near useless. We hang like a 
miasma over the city, surfing their 
waves and quietly studying in their 
coffee shops. Sometimes we make 
their lattes a little too hot, tailgate 
them in their BMWs, or buy the last 
package of baby organic spinach at 
Trader Joe's - all on purpose, of 
course, because we're little shits. 

Little shits or not, UCSD stu-
dents deserve some serious credit for 
subjecting themselves to four years 
of going to ~lIege in a ~?n-colleg~ 
town. Hell, cheap rent, frat row 
and "football games" are all foreign 
concepts in La Jolla - plus, I'm 
pretty sure that even mentioning the 
word "kegger" is a criminal offense 
here. It's a tough life for anyone who 
wants to have fun and can't make it 
out to Pacific Beach or Tijuana every 
night. 

But wait! We're not so downtrod-
den after all - our neighbors down 
the hill teach us a very important les-
son: Maybe, just maybe, if we work 
hard enough, we too can be rich, 
Botoxed, snobby pricks, just like 
them. Want to skip grad school? Fine 
- just be prepared to be a restaurant 
server forever. Willing to keep on 
with your education, exploit every 
connection you have and kiss some 
serious ass? Fantastic - get ready, 
son, because you're going to be that 
Gucci-suited restaurant patron who 
snaps his fingers and asks for a better 
able and low-carb bread. 

Ok, ok, I'll stop. I know I'm not 
helping the situation by poking fun 
at ollr host city, which, even if it 
detest us, has at least refrained from 
leveling our campus and building a 
golf course. 

But isn't it odd that even after 45 
years of UCSD, the city of La Jolla 
still refuses to adapt to us - and, 
adding insult to injury, acts like we're 
a liability? All we ask for is accep-
tance, Lalolla. Our dothes might be 
from Target and our hair might be 
disheveled, but we can do your taxes. 
We can design a nice vacation home 
for you. At the vety least, we can 
carry your bags up to your hotel 
room. Is everything in your suite to 
your liking, sir? 

La Jolla is a beautiful place to 
have. university, but it simply isn't

time to give them a chance. 

The necessary changes to 
improve undergraduate education 
wouldn't be too difficult. Bring 
UCSD's greatest accomplishments 
into the undergraduate classrooms 
by allowing guest lecturers, or even 
force researchers to teach an under-
graduate course eve.ry once in a 
while. Bring down class sizes so stu-
dents aren't encouraged to shut up 
and free-ride their way through 
their undergraduate classes. Pay 
your faculty who deal with under-
graduates decent wages. Repair your 

buildings, so students and faculty 
who are not working on UCSD's 
"pet projects" actua lIy have a sense 
of pride in their working environ-
ment. If you can integrate under-
grads into research, then sponsoring 
companies will line up offering to 
pay for the necessary improvements. 

Simply ignoring undergraduate 
education and allowing it to waste 
away in favor of newsworthy grad-
uate projects is no way to keep 
UCSD a pan of "the finest univer-
sity in the world," as UC President 
Robert C. Dynes named the 
University of California. 

Column: La Jolla residents 
need to just lighten up 

cominW!d from page 4 
welcoming to anyone who doesn 't 
scream "New Money". Maybe it 'll 
take another 45 years for La Jolla to 
realize that we're not a leper colony, 
but a university, and bumping into a 
student while waiting in line at Saks 
is not going to leave anyone perma-
nently tainted by the cooties of pub-
lic-school students. 

La Jolla is the non-college-town 
college town, while the best college 
towns resemble the best party hosts: 
willing to relax some rules and sacri-
fice a little class and cleanliness for a 
raging good time. Just look at Santa 
Cruz or Berkeley: a little kooky, a 
little smelly and a lot friendly - not 
the type to gasp with disgust at any-
one wearing pajama pants at the 
grocery store because it taints the 
city's squeaky-clean, highly polished 
image. 

La Jolla is the nun of the coun-
try's college towns. She's got a ruler, 
and she' s not afraid to put students 
back in thei r place. 

In the end, something's gotta 
give. To save La lolla the embar-
rassment of lightening the hell up, 
UCSD students have done their 
best to shed all the hallmarks of 
being young and in college. Who 
needs a Greek row, football games 
or an active student nightlife when 
you can enjoy a Porsche, an au pair 
for your kids and a luxury resort 
overlooking the beach that blocks 
ocean views for ERe students? 

Indeed, who needs it? Not us, 
apparently.

Arnold said. "That's a remarkable 
job, especially dealing with large 
schools, because a lot of movement 
happens in smaller schools, but 
with the larger schools sometimes 
there [are smaller fluctuations in 
the number of] volunteers." 

Every year, the organization 
looks at the number of volunteers in 
the field and what colleges they 
came from to determine the rank-
ing .. The list is divided into three 
categories according to the size of 
university student populations. 
Large universities represent cam-
puses with more than 15,000 
undergraduates, medium universi-
ties have between 5,00 I and 15,000 
and small schools enroll fewer than 
5,000.

Arnold. 

"The Peace Corps is a different 
agency now than in the past," 
Arnold said. "We've been getting 
into technical stuff and are loolting 
for more specialized skills j such as 
engineering, and there might be 
more people in UCSD who have 
those sldlls. ~ 

Events such as job fairs and 
information se sions have been 
vital in promoting the organization 
at UCSD and perhaps contributing 
to the rise in numbers, according to 
new campus Peace Corps represen-
tative and former volunteer Diana 
Gomez. As many as 500 to 6{lO stu-
dents have indicated intereSt dur-
ing the ' present school year; she 
said . 

"UCSD is a campus focused on 
internationalization and global 
issues," Career Services Center 
director Andy Ceperley said. "It's 

not surpnsmg that Peace Corps 
numbers are growing." 

While being a college graduate is 
not a requirement to join the orga-
nization, 97 percent of volunteers 
have undergraduate degrees and 13 
percent hold graduate degrees. 
Through the Peace Corps, 7,733 
volunteers are working around . the 
world, according to Arnold. 

"I think that all of us as human 
beings have a special need to do 
something for other people," 
Gomez said. "[rhe Peace Corps] is 
a way for people to grow." 

Since its inception in 1961, the 
Peace Corps has S'2ut more than 

~78,000 volunteers to 136 coun-
tries. Through the program, volun-
teers w?rk with projects in various 
fields including agri~ulture, busi-
ness development, information 
technology, public health services 
and education. 

"It's a grandiose experience," 
Gomez s~id . . "From traveling and 
knowing other cultures and looking 
at life, you can really grow spiritu-
ally." 1 I' 

Applicants go through a SIX- to 
12-month application process that. 
includes an interview, medical and 
legal review and an official invita-
tion from the organization. 
Eligibility requirements include 
U.S. citizenship, a 27-month com-
mitment and a minimum age of 18. 

The number of applications in 
the past year has also increased by 10 
percent, with one of three applicants 
becoming a volunteer, Arnold said. 

Volunteers in the Peace Corps 
receive be~e6ts like loan defer-
ment, graduate school opportuni-
ties and medical and dental care 
while in service.

FerhIps the most illllestir18 aspect about leNS is that it is an

"About 30 yellS aao,the nursery was aeated for fnn>ian fam-

10 maintain their CMIO cuIue, and local dliIdren are taught about 
oIher CDlI1Iries. For example, all the children learn to S6'( a few 
WOlds and sing "Happy Birthday" in se.<eraI different languages. 

ICNS requires that parents participate two days each month 
by proIIiding snacks, cleaning dishes or helping the children with 
activities. They are also required 10 join a committee and help 
with laundry, maintenance, animal care or disaster-preparedness,

"Parent irNoIIIement is essential because leNS 
started as a parent aHJP, and we believe it is 
important for parents to be il1llOlved in their chil-
dren's INes and actMties: Justice said. 

GiUian said that if not for the help of ICNS and 
the support of her sis1er and her warren College 
advisers she would not be in school. 

"ICNS gives me peace of mind: she said. NIt's 
safe; I know all the workers and most of the other 
parents." 

lCNS is open five days a week from 9 a.m. to 
4 p.m., and costs range from S 120 per month to 
$936 per month, depending on the status of the 
parent and the programs he or she chooses for 
the dlild. Operated by parents, employees, stu-
dent employees and volunteers, it is open on 
Wednesdays and Thursdays for parents to visit 
with their children and decide if the nursery is a 
good choice for them. 

1CNS is like a family: Gillian said. "The best 
thing about it is that the woricers truly care. They re 
not just doing a job."

WINTERFEST 2005 
featuring SOCIAL DISTORTION 

RIMAe Arena, doors open at 6:30pm 
Mike Ness and SOCIAL DISTORTION set 

themselves apm from the slew of Punk bands to 
emerge from Orange County during the early 
1980s with the release of "Mommy ~ LiNlt 
MonsrC'"- rega rded as one of the best West 
Coast Punk albums ever. Touching on teen 
alienation, self-destructive behavior and street 
life, and espousing a total repudiation of middle 
class America, this debut is one's of Punk's most 

_ articulate manifestos. Unfommateiy, their hino-
ry is strewn with line-up changes and inner 
demons, Ness spent some time in jail. then 

rehab, and then cashed in on his newly acquired credibility as a convict rock 
'n'rolier, "Prison Bound" debuted a new Rockabilly-anchored sound and 

reve~led Ness's new lyrical preoccupations with nihilistic outlaw laments, 
No longer a Plmk band in the least, subsequent records were gritty docu -
ments of America's obsession with outsiders and established Social 
Distortion as spo\::espersons for modem day rebels without a cause. Their 
most recent CD is "S~x, Lovt and Rock'll Roll" from 2004. Also on the bili 
are US-ONE, BACKYARD BAilES , and DJ WillOW. Tickets are free to 
UCSD students with valid 10, Space is limited, so arrive early.

Someone at E-Trade Financial

call my favorite of all time. In this 
priceless spot, a chimpanzee wear-

Although E-Trade was just 
going for some cheap laughs over 
a dancing monkey, they had a very 
valid point: We Know that these 
prices are ridiculous, but it's all in 
good fun. 

So, whether Donovan McNabb 
hooks up with Owens and the

Men's hockey beats Northridge, 3 .. 1 
Late goals and solid defense • secure VIctOry 

Anchw Mo/Guotcfan 

CoISt to coast: The UCSD ice hockey dub team played solid offense and 
defense in its 3·1 victory against Cal State Northridge on Jan. 29. 

By CYNTHIA BLADE CHAVEZ 
Associate Sports Editor 

Bouncing pucks and cheap shots 
from the opposing team did not stop 
the UCSD ice hockey club team 
from winning, 3-1, in a Pacific 
Collegiate Hockey Association game 
against Cal State Northridge onJan. 
29 at the UTC Ice {]halet. 

Junior Kevin Davis scored the 
game-winning goal, while junior 
goalie Gavin Gruber came up with 
crucial saves to secure the victory. 
Sophomore forward Kolin Oronia 
also contributed two assists in the 
winning effon. 

''We just wanted to be relaxed, 
have some fun and play solid," 
UCSD senior and team captain 
Chris Tran aid. 

The less-than-ideal conditions of 
the UTC Ice Chalet proved to be an 
advantage for the Tritons, as the 
Matadors had to adjust to the soft 
ice, which made skating and puck 
handling more difficuJt. 

"We practice here all the time so 
we're used to it," Tran said. "But 
other teams, they're used to playing 
on real ice that's not like water, so it's 
a home-ice advantage for us." 

UCSD dominated the first peri-
od, with most of the a(:tion on the 
Matadors' defensive end. The 
Tritons also controlled most of the 
faceoffs, generating scoring oppor-
tunities. With only one minute, 31 
seconds left in the first period, junior 
Charlie Blake found the Cal State 

Nonhridge goalie out of position 
and slipped the puck past him to give 
UCSD a 1-0 lead. Ownia was cred-
ited with the assist on Blake's goal. 

The Matadors answered with a 
power-play goal early in the second 
period to knot the game. Triton 
senior Ben Turris was called for 
holding and Cal State Northridge 
capitalized on the man advantage. 
The game-tying goal s.hifted the 
momentum to the Matadors, who 
put some pressure on the Triton 
defense, but tearns remained dead· 
locked after two periods. 

UCSD owned the third period, 
playing solid defensively while scor-
ing two more goals. Davis quickly 
pounced on his own rebounded shot 
and put the puck over the Cal State 
Nonhridge goalie's shoulder for a 2-
1 lead at 1 :30. 

Junior forward Kenton Fibel of 
the Tritons put the biscuit in the bas-
ket for an insurance goal, assisted by 
Oronia with less than five. minutes 
left in the game. The Matadors 
became increasingly frustrated as the 
clock wound down and play became 
chippy betwcen the two teams. The 
undisciplined play cost the Matadors 
a chance to pull their goalie to try to 
even the score when Gevork 
Pasmayan's drew a high-sticlcing 
penalty with 2:28 left. In addition, 
Cal State Nonhridge's Jon Dobson 
received a five-minute major penalty 
for cross-checking and game rnis-

Men's . basketball beats San Francisco State 
Tritons can't hold off Sonoma State on Spirit Night 
By JOE TEVELOWm 

Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's basketball 
team kept things interesting over 
the weekend as it split a pair of 
home games. The Tritons fell to a 
hot-shooting Sonoma State team 
on Jan. 28, 64-51, before a large 
Spirit Night audience. The team's 
shooting warmed up on Jan. 29 in 
a raror-thin 61-58 victory over 
San Francisco State. 

The Tritons (7-10 overall, 3-7 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association) played a solid first 
half against San Francisco State 
(8-9 overalJ, 5-5 CCAA) as the 
two teams battled back and forth 
for most of the first half at 
RIMAC Arena. The Tritons were 
able to take a five-point advan-
tage with less than nine minutes 
remaining in the half, but the 
Gators came all the way back, 
taJcing a six-point lead with less 
than a minute remaining and 
going into the half up four. 

In the second half, the Tritons 
were on fire from the. field . The 
team shot an astonishing 81.3 
percent (13-of-16) and demon-
strated great shot selection, tak-
ing only two shots from three-
point range and converting on 
one. 

San Francisco State was able to 
hang right with the Tritons for the 
half as the six-point first-half lead 
was the largest by either team in 
the entire game. 

Despite the Gators shooting a 
depressed 44 percent from the 
field and a poor 12 .5 percent 
from three-point range, the 
TIitons were unable to distance 
themselves from their CCAA 
opponent. 

After San Francisco State's 
Mike Dyer converted one of his 
two free-throw attempts, the two 
teams were loclced up at 54-54 
with less than two minutes to 
play. 

The Tritons and Gators each 
convened two free throws and 
one basket on their next two pos-
sessions as the score was dead-
locked at 58-58 with only 38 sec-
onds left on the clock. 
Sophomore forward Parker 
Berling proved clutch in the criti-
cal moments, rebounding Ryan 
Cleaves' missed layup and con-
verting a layup of his own at the 
other end off freshman guard 
Andrew Hatch's assist. 

San Francisco State then con-
jured up memories of Chris 
Webber in his Michigan 
Wolverine days by calling a time-
out it did not have. 

Berling converted one of two 
technical free throws to give the 
Tritons their margin of victory 
when Joe Roberson was unable to 
conven a desperate three-point 
attempt. 

Roberson nearly recorded a 
double-double for the game, with 
game-highs of 22 points and nine 
rebounds. Cleaves also added 17 
points in 35 minutes off the bench, 
and Dyer contributed nine points, 
two rebounds and three assists for 
the Gators. 

Triton junior guard Odioh 
Odiyeh's' 16 points paced UCSD 
along with 14 points from 
Berling. Hatch had a solid game 
with nine points, a team-high five 
rebounds and a game-high six 
assists. 

The Tritons shot 65.7 percent 
for the game, compared with a 
43 .1 percent field-goal shooting

performance from the Gators. 
However, the Tritons were 
unable to fully exploit their accu-
rate shooting due to struggles 
with baJi control- racJcing up 26 
turnovers - and at the free-
throw line, where the Tritons 
converted 13 of 24 attempts. The 
fact that the team took only a trio 
of three-point shots - and made 
two - was a welcome display of 
shot selection. In contrast, the 
Gators needed 14 attempts to 
convert two three-pointers of 
their own. 

The shot-selection shoe W2S on 
the other foot Jan. 28 as the 
Tri,tons fell victim to their excess 
of three-point attempts in their 

defeat to Sonoma State (10-6 
overaJl, 7-3 CCAA). Playing in 
front of a raucous 2,511 fans for 
Spirit Night at RIMAC Arena, the 
Tritons took too many three-point 
shots in the second half rather 
than searching for the better shot 
inside. 

After the lead went back and 
. forth between the two teams for 

much of the fint balf, UCSD 
must have been pleased to enter 
halftime down by only one follow-
ing junior forward David 
Retzlaff's jumper right before the 
buzzer. The team shot 45.8 per-
cent from the field, including 14.3

Super 
Bowl 

ads wjll 
deliver 

The Sports 
Retort 

Rael Enteen 
n less than a week, one of the 
most awaited annual moments 
in sports history will arrive. 

Yes, the Sports Illustrated swimsuit 
edition is coming soon, but that's 
beside the point. On Feb. 6, mil-
lions of people across the world 
will tune in to Fox and witness 
some of the best commercials of aJi 
time. 

The Super Bowl will be great: 
The game provides a decent 
matchup and Tom Brady could join 
the likes of Joe Montana on 
Sunday. Terrell Owens, whether he 
plays or not, will be in the spotlight 
and will add to the entertainment 
factor of the game. All things con-
sidered, however, the advertise-
ments will make even the biggest 
blowout fun for all. 

In years past, Super Bowls have 
been mediocre at best. Only two of 
the last 12 Super Bowls have been 
decided by less than a touchdown. 
Take, for instance, Super Bowl 
XXXVII, when the lampa Bay 
Buccaneers trounced the Oakland 
Raiders, 48-21. The Bucs were up 
20-3 at the half and the Raiders 
never showed any sign of a come-
back. However, despite the disap-
pointing game, the ads were excel-
lent. 

Some especially good Super 
Bowl xxxvn ads: the debut of the 
commercial in which two models 
wrestle in a pool to decide whether 
Miller Lite is better because of its 
great taste or the fact that it is less 
filling, and the Pepsi ad with the 
Osbournes and the Osmonds. 

"Without these breaks from a 
boring game, what would we do? 
Critics say the commercials are a 
distraction, that they disrespect the 
game. They also don't want to lose 
focus on the game because of a 
bunch of tasteless $2 million ads. 
They ask the question, who wants 
to be bothered by a bunch f)f stupid 
ads during the biggest game of the 
year? 

I do. Is there any other time 
when you can look forward to 
commercials? Normally, I dread 
ads because they are stupid, pre-
posterous and distasteful, not to 
mention that they are unworthy of 
my time. 

Super Bowl ads are clever; they 
aren't meaningless 30-second 
spots. They are miniature movies, 
brilliant works of art that are all 
unveiled to the world in one glori-
ous afternoon. And this year will 
not disappoint. I can't wait to see 
how the Miner Lite vs. Bud Light 
ad campaign continues, and I'm 
sure both companies will playoff 
each other nicely with those refer-
ee ads. 

The avera~ cost for. 30-tec:0nd 
spot this year is $2.4 million; with 
the big name companies choosing co 
go for minute-long spots, an ad this 
year could cost almost $5 million. 
No wonder these ads are so good -
who wants CO spend 5 million bucks 
unless you think the ad will work
