The focus of the presentation 
was on watching demos. hut their 
creat ion and the concepts behind 
them were also discussed. 

Hutchinson outlined three major 
issues in the creation of demos; the 
music, 3-D modeling and the pro-

arc spoken in Mexico. The concept 
of ethnicity is reduced to four cate-
gories in the Mex ican Census: 
mixed (a broad category that com-
pri ses 59 percent of the populati on), 
indigenous, white and foreign. 

"The differences in the frame-

club members discussed, the basics 
of graphi cs programming and J-D

Real-time graphics programming, a

4 OPINION 

By SImone Santini 
Conlrlbuling Opinion Writer 

On July 23, 1997, Joseph O'Dell was executed in 
a Virginia penitentiary. The case against him was 
weak, but an almost decl~ive proot of inno(;em;e or 
guilt could have been obtained through a DNA tesl. 
The judge, however, refuscd to order the test because 
of a techni(;ality. 

The death of O'Dell. while receiving lillie allen-
tion from the American pUblic, provoked loud and 
widespread outrage in many European countries and, 
par1icularly, in haly. 

The day of O'Dell'!. execution, all but the mo~t 
conservative Italian newspaper~ reported the news on 
the front page, with titles like "State Murder" and 
'The State of Virginia Murders O'Dell." 

The Pope asked the execution to be suspended and 
the U.S. to grant O'Dell an appeal. However, in 
America, stopping the death of a convicted criminal 
in the pursuit of justice is not popular. Voters might 
think of it a~ "being son on crime." From the politi-
cian" pOint of view, it is much ocHer to convict a man 
who i~ po~~ibly inn()(;ent than to lo~e out in the polls. 

,As a re!>uh, an innoccnt man sat in hi s death row 
cell waiting to b.: killed. 

Incn:dihly ~erious situations like thes.: should he 
a priority of the United States. We should always 
~trive to do whatever is necessltry to protect the 
innocenl. Cas.:s like that ufO'Del1 arc oecoming all 
too common. In this case, it took other nations to 
dis(;over the tragedy hidden from the American pUb: 
lic becau~e officials were more concerned about 
votes than justice. 

To many observers, this case appeared to be the 
stubborn refusal of a judiciary system to admit even 
the possibility of having made a mistake . .Joseph 
O'Dell looks suspicious ly like a sacriliciallamb used 
to placate the blood-thirst of an angry mob - a crime 
was commined and somehody (it was not important 
who) had to pay. 

The American press completely ignored this case 
for a long period of time - a source of concern for 
many ob!>ervers. The case was probably deemed as 
bad for ratings - at least, less appealing than the 
e!>capades of some Hollywood actor. 

Only after the European press created the case, and 
the Pope intervened on O'Ocll's behalf, did some

Reality Check 

Okay, here is a tragic story 
(wel l. for me. anyway) . 

It was the middle of August and 
I was running late 10 my job 20 
miles away. Taking advamage of 
the sparse trartic and the five -mile 
stretch of four-Ianc highway, I 
decided to speed it up a bi t and pas~ 
as many cars as I could before the 
road disappeared into a slow two-
laner. 

Extremcly stupid mi~take. 
Not only was thi s stretch of 

highway notorious for ticket-writ-
ing cops, I was a dumb speeder. I 
daned around and was far away 
from any stable group of cars, 
always rushing ahead. As I reached 
the 200-foot point before the 
speedy four lanes disappeared, I 
saw blue and red ligbts Oashing in 
my rear-view mirror. 

Ten minutes later. had 
acquired my first ticket - 70 mph 
in a 60 mph zone. Of course, I was 
still late for work. 

So a fcw weeks later, I went to 
the Napa Courthouse, paid the sus-
picious "Administrative Fcc" and 
got the information about traffic 
sc hool.

savior of bad drivers everywhere,

DMV-rcgulated nightmare. 

Scene change 10 San Diego - I 
looked for a ni(;c , reputable traffic 
school in the ye llow page~ and linal-
Iy settled on $13.50 traffic school. It 
was obviously a respectable cduca-
1I0nai faci lity, known for its .:litc 
group of professors and high educa-
tional ~Iandards ... well, I guess the 
name says it all. 

Wednesday moming, I walked 
into the small hotel conference 
room where the (; Ias ~ was held and 
found the most random assmtmenl 
of people with whom I have ever 
spent a day. Every race, age, pro-
fession , gender and educational 
level was represented there - sort 
of like a melting pot for people 
who can't drive. 

As the day wore on. a few very 
distinci personalities made them-
se lves well known to the rest of the 
class. 
Miss Know-It-All 

I not only got the pleasure of ~it­
ting closest to this character, but I 
was rewarded with watching her 
head bobble in disagreement for 
the entire six hours and 40 minutes. 

Mi ss Know-It-A ll was once 
married to a cop and is therefore 
automatically blessed with the 
knowledge of every single vehicle 
code and state law. 

or course, she would not deny 
us her remarkable information. and 
wnstalllly gave us her extraordi-

Just as he drove 
under an overpass, 
a car came sailing 
off the freeway 
above him and 
landed smack dab, 
upside-down In front 
of him. Of course he 
crashed Into It and 
mangled his own 
car. 
nary insight on every issue that 
(;ame up. Fortunately, she memo-
rized the exact dollar amount for 
the fine of each law and enlight-
ened us all. 

Not only does Miss Know-Jt-
All have the knowledge, but she 
has the experience, as well. She has 
broken every obscure law known 10 
man but managed to have all the 
charges dropped. I' 

While it may be illegal for the 

resl of the wuntry 10 ride a horse in 
public while drunk, MISS Know-It-
All can, hecause she docs not wn-
tml the horse - the horse is pre-
programmed tn know exactly 
where to go. Boy. I wish I had a 
horse like thaI. 

The best pari about Miss Know-
It -All is that she had such a delight-
ful altitude. Not afraid to tell off 
any other student or Ihe teacher, her 
"shut up and listen to me because I 
"now what I am talking ahout and 
you arc all a bunch of crap" altitud.: 
dominated every diswssion . 
I Old Not Deserve My Ticket 

I Did Not Deserve My Ticket is 
absolutely convinced that the offi -
cer had no right to even consider 
giving him a ticket. When he is 
asked to tell the clas~ what law he 
broke, he goes off into a 10-minute 
spiel about how the light was ycl -
low, and he was tuming like this, 
and hi s tires were thi s far over the 
line, and hc pulls out charts and 
graphs and visual diagrams, and he 
just won't shut up. 

Evcry question that comes I Did 
Not Deserve My Ticket's way is 
answered with a "Yes, but the light 
was ye llow and I was turning 
and ... " and on and on and on. 

I am still not sure why he was 
convinced complaining to u~ was 
going to help. Thcre wasn't any-
thing we cou ld do about it. Gce 
whir., tell it to the olTiccr, not us! (I 
was going the speed of tralTiL: , olTi-
cer, and I was late for work and thiS 

overseas 

car ahead or me was so darn slO\\ 
and .. . ). 
Turbo Note-Taker XLE 

TralTic school is a very serious 
mailer for Turho Note-Taker XLE, 
and shc is extremely concerned 
with rcmembering every detail. 
Her notcs go on for mlle~ and 
miles . 

I was not ~ure if she was plan-
ning on writing a book or what, hut 
I think ~he tilled eight notcpads full 
of what the colors on the curt" 
stand for and how long the SlOp -
ping distance for a car goi ng 30 
mph is and elaborate charts of 
blood-alcohol levels. 

My notes were comprised or 
Slick figures and doodles; I \:Ould-
n' t have cared less aoout what the 
teacher was saying. 
Accident Andy la.k.a. I Want To 
Die) 

It is no wonder that Accident 
Andy was in traffic school. What 
we should really be wondering is 
how he has managed to stay alive 
for so long. 

Accident Andy has been in so 
many bizarre car crashes, he keeps 
the jaws of life in hi s trunk next to 
the spare tire. After every accidcnl, 
hc swears he wi II never drive again, 
but Ihrec months later, he is in 
another wreck. The great thing 
about Andy, however, is that hi~ 
iu.:cident~ arc so weird.

quite serious - the mayor of

The mayor asked to have

Example number two - A few 
years ago, Andy wa~ merging onto 

quences on international relations. 
Already, the temperature is chill -
ing between the U.S. and its part-

ner~, in part (although obviously 
not only) because of the death 
penalty. For example, some 
European countries passed laws 
that prohibit the ex tradition of 
those who face the death penalty 
to the U.S. 

Today, America i culturally

and commercial partners . QUite

do not ea re too much about thi ~. 
Not enough, in any ca~e, to threat-

It is much easier to sell empty

doubts about the legitimacy of 
many death-penalty sentences. Poor 
legal rcpresentat ion, disregard for 
the possibility of mental illness (at 
least II of the 56 prisoners execut-
ed during 1995 suffered from men-
tal illness or mental retardation), 
racial bi as and sentences based on 
doubtful testimonies make cases 
like that of O'Dell relati vely fre -
quent. Somc of thcm arc incredible. 

Jesse DeWayne J acob~ wa!> sen-
tenced to death In Texas for the 
murder of Etta Ann Urdiales. The 
prosecutor convinced the jury that 
Jacobs had actual ly pulled the trig-
ger. and that this re,ulted in the 
death pena lty. 

Later on, the prmecutor 
changed hiS mind and charged 
Jacobs' sister wi th the ame mur-
der. She was sentenced to 10 years 
for vo luntary manslaughter. 
Incred ibly, Jesse DeWayne Jacob's 
sentence was not revoked, and he 
was executed. 

The newspaper L'O.uervatore 
Romano. the official organ of the 
Holy Sec and usually a very sober 
and restrai ned publication, Ilatly 
ca lled the execution a murder. 

A~ if had luck hadn ' t hurt him 
enough, Andy ' ~ car slammed into a

But wait ! It get~ better. Among 
those nine people was a pregnant 
woman who began to go into labor

and Andy was once again without a 
car. I am prell> surl: that II should

As the Supreme Court is ruling 
increas ingly in favor of "fast" 
deaths, denyi ng more requests for 
appeals and the consideration of 
new evidence for death row 
inmates, we can expect a consider-
able increase in deaths by techni -
cality. 

For a country that prides itself 
on its Chri stian foundation , 
America lacks many of the emi -
nently Christian vi rtues of mercy, 
compassion, forgiveness and empa-
thy. Some of the foundations of 
Christian morality like "love your 
enemy" are regularly overlooked. 

In Ameri ca, victim~' fa milie. 
are allowed to witness executions, 
in a !>ort of macabre cathartic ritual. 
People stay outside penitentiaries 
on the day of executions and cheer 
when the prisoner is killed. 
Regardless of what one thinks 
about the necessi ty of the death 
penalty, cheering because a person 
is killed is a terrible and inhuman 
thing to do. 

One cannot help but wonder 
what will happen to a society in 
which this kind of attitude is wide-
spread. Definitely nothing good.

"Cu rrently there i, no given

Parker said. "What happens histor-
Ically to a certain dass, in a given 
year, can affect c'li gibilit) ." 

Previously, similar studics were 
conducted for the graduating class-
es of 1983, 1986 and 1990. 

"It makes sense to do a study 
like thi s more often," Backer said. 
"Why not do it every yea r or every

Parker said that pUlling together

major challenge for the education 
commission, and that is why it has-
n't been done' more often.

said. "It requires a lot of effort... 
and it costs money." 

The study found that CSU eligi-
bility declined among all racial 
groups, but the sharpest drop was 
for African Americans and Latino 
graduates. UC eligibility rates for 
whites and Latinos remained about

"We want people to know they 
have the power to change things 
from the way they are ," Oyewole 
said. "Revoluti on sta rt s with the 
se lf. If we can take time to have 
revolution and get rid of all the 
nastiness. therc won' t be any 
time to bl ame others for our mis- ' 
ery." 

Oyewole, who is a biology pro-
fesso r at Columbia University, said 
that co lleges arc a good way of 
reaching people. 

"College is an apathetic zone," 
Oyewole said. "I love it because 
it's fertile ground for reaching 
young minds." 

Oyewole said he opens his 
home almosl every weekend to 
anyone who wants to di scuss poet-
ry and creative writing. Oyewole 
said artists such as the Wu-Tang 
Clan and Erykah Badu have visited 
his house to improve their song 
lyrics. 

XIBIT, a rap artist from Los 
Angeles, performed after The Last 
Poets. 

Intermission di sc jockey John 
Castillo said XIBIT kept the crowd 
energetic and the bass loud. 

"Xl BIT played with the crowd," 
Castillo said. "Getting a 101 of feed-
back makes it fun for the crowd. 
He's also really good at free-
styling." 

Students said they enjoyed the 
hip-hop slyle of the Urban 
Contemporary Music Series. 
Friday 's event was the firsl in the 
month-long series. 

"It's nice to see a lot of people 
from different races come together 
who appreciate the hip-hop cul-
ture," said Christine Walker, a 
Warren sophomore. 

"UCSD's student life is kind of 
dull," said Marshall freshman 
Minesh Patel. "It's almost like peo-
ple are afraid to parly here. I 
thought the concert was a good 
idea because it helps people who 
don't have access to leave the cam-

Soapbox 
Br ........ C.hlll 
Graphics Editor 
You Poor, Dumb, 
Bastards 

Of late. I have noti ced two 
major t endencie~ in these soapbox 
l:olumns. 

One: Editor nOIll:e~ that no one 
at UCSD 11<1 \ any lun. Edilor 
ex trapolates that this I, ~o bel:au~e 
no onc at uest) knol" where 10

fun things the edilor does here al 
uest). 

I alll not going to uo th". If you 
arc not haVing fun , you deserve II . 
hecause you arc too stupid to go 
out and find fun things to do. 
Anyway, stupid people shoufd Just 
stay home and shut up so as not 10 
disturb the rest of us whi Ie we arc 
having fun . If you arc already hav-
ing fun ". well , you don't need me 
to tell you how. Come by the 
Guardia" and we' ll have a beer 
with Travis. 

Two: Editor rants and ra ves for 
as many column inches as the 
design nazis give him about some 
random subject that is probably of 
no interest to anyone outside the 
editor's own jaded little world. I 
think [' II do this. 

Everyone else at the Guardian 
is far too nice to say ii , but all of the 
papers on campus pretty much 
suck. They all suck In unique and 
different ways , and tu different 
degrees. but they all suck. So here , 
in reverse sequential order, is my 
comprehcnsive (meaning every 
paper I can think of ofT the top of 
my head) lisl of how these wasles 
of bark pulp suck. 

S. The G,wrdillll : This paper 
sucks the least , and I'm not just 
saying that out of an overriding 
fear for my job security. It's funny 
(though I Ihink most of the funny 
stuff is not intentionally so). it 
comes out twice a week and is 
always on time. It covers a variety 
of subjecls of possible interest to its 
college constituency. it occasional-
ly has color and. most impol1antly. 
it is beautifully and competently 
i lIu~tmted . 

The drawings are consistently 
good, show a huge amount of effol1 
on the part of the obviously talent-
ed artists and draw the reader into 
the story by the sheer force of their 
greatness. 

However, all is not flowers. 
rainbows and cuddles at the 
Gllardiall . "The Norm" (that comic 
strip you stopped reading after the 
second issue this year) is a sin that 
is three-peated every damn issue. I 
swear we're all going straight to 
journalist hell if this keeps up. 
(Kids. write to the paper and 
demand the return of "Li fe in 
Hell," please!) 

This pal1icular rag also devotes 
way too much space to stories con-
cerning scholastic issues at UeSD. 
This is. of course. a laudable goal. 
but it IS unfonunately. a pointless 
goal . 

None of you out there actually 
care about the new species of gray

Recently, a flurry of dating services 
have been advertised on San Diego's 
local radio stations. Great Expectations , a 
video-dating service located in Mission

perfect match for you!" 

The company researches every appli-

alternative to the UCSD dating 
scene may not be particularly 
complementary to the tradilional 
image of the starving student. The 
membership dues speak for them-
selves, as there is no way anyone 
without a steady income could 
afford them . 

However, young, educated 
females are heing sought after, 
and Great Expeclations is willing 
to lower Ihe price for such stu -
denls. Aflcr the diseounl . the 
membership due~ arc close to Ihe 
dues of a sorority or fraternity. 

At Great Expectations, a pho-

"What is an orgasm?" 
By Mary HIggins Senior Staff Writer 
"Not A Licensed Therapist" 

Midterms, icy windshields 
and nu season; it's gelling to be 
thaI depressing time of year 
again - winter. I went to the 
beach last week to watch Ihe sun-
set and nearly died of hYPolher-

Luckily, a lifeguard was on 
hand 10 thaw me out and then

Originally, my plan was to 
hibernate through the winter. 
Yesterday, I had a big meal , pulled 
on my sweats. kicked back on the 
couch and prepared to walch TV 
unlil April. 

It turns out thal the evi I 
scriptwrilers are trying to kill off 
all my favorite characters with 
incurable diseases. I can't bear to 
walch another "X-Fi les"

David Duchovney will have

According to 
Websten, the term 
"orgasm" originates 
from the Greek 
word, "orgasmos," 
which means, "to 
grow ripe, be 
lustful." The modern 
definition Is equally 
useless: "the climax 
of sexual 
excitement In 
coitus. " 
sage to all of you Trilons: ch.:er 
up. I know you aJithink that you r 
life would be so much beller if 
you'd gone to a different universi-
ty, but that 's not Irue. 

Trust me, if you hadn't been 
ruthlessly rejected from Stanford, 
you 'd be walking around right 
now in an ugly red sweatshirt and 
cheering for a siupid mascot at the 
football games. I'm from the Palo 
Alto area myself, and I hate to be 
disloyal, but I just can't get psy-
ched up watching a lame palm 
tree get its coconuts kicked in by 
rabid ue Berkeley fans. 

Speaking of football teams, 
aren ' t you glad we don't have one 
of our own? Instead of frivolously 
wasting our time at some stupid 
social event, we, al UeSD, have

Besides, if we ever saw any 

action on our million-dollar 
RIMAe field, the noise might 
upset the Revelle students who 
live in the basement of the Geisel 
Library. Now, lhat just wouldn ' t 
be fair. 

This week, I hope 10 receive 
some e-mail from people 
other than intoxlc~lIed memhers of 
the UCSD pep band. Ha, ha. just

This leads me 10 what we've 
all been waiting for - the "Leiter 
of the Week." Thb week's winner 
w:!; submilled by a Rooseve lt 
senior we'll call Jake: 

"Dear Mary, wha! is all 
orgasm ?" 

I'm glad you asked. Well, Jake, 
my initial response was thi s: an 
orgasm is an entily with ils own 
neurosyslem - including interde-
pendent organs - and a variable 
life span. My editor, however. 
poinled out that I was describing 
an organism. It turns out they 
aren't the same thing. 

I put my crack research team 
right 10 work. They hit the pave-
ment for 48 solid hours, inlerview-

using the dictionary. Here are the

Boston-Bound GET OUT: VolleybalJ, this 
Saturday at 7 p.m, 

YIN a YANG: Men advanced to National 
Finals while women finished third in Regiona1s ContInued from page 20 I incentive to go out, we have even 

offered to sacrifice our sobriety if 
that 's what it takes - especially on 
a Friday ... 

By KeYin Mclaughlin 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD cross country team 
had been rockin ' down the high-
way, steamrolling all comers en 

route to win-
ning the 
California 
Collegiate 
At hie tic 
Association 
Championship. 

Now, after a three-week hia-
tus, the team took the last step on 
the stairway to the heaven of 
Nationals. Running in Chino, 
Calif. Saturday morning, the 
men's team blew past the field to 
reach the promised land. 

However, every silver lining 
has a touch of gray. The women's 
team did not fare so well, falling 
to perennial spoi led-sport 
Colorado College after pUlling 
together its best race of the year 
in the CCAA Championships. 

Though this was certainly a 
letdown for one of the best 
women's teams in UCSD history, 
the beat will go on for sophomore 
Amy Kitchen, who qualified for 
an individual spot in National~ 
with a sixth-place finish . 

The spotlight shone mo~t 
brightly on the men, who put 
together one of the best races ever 
for the Tritons in claiming the 
Regional title for the'lxth time in 
seven years . 

For the first time this ~e"~()n , 
CCAA Athlete or the Year Gavin 
Klinger played ~econd fiddle , lin-
ishing two seconds behind late-
season stud Neal Harder. 

Steve Varnell was only 15 sec-
onds behind to capture third, and 
Franzwa Achie and lames 
Nielsen finished in tandem, 
claiming the sixth and seventh 
spots to round out the top five 
UCSD finishers, 

Mike Wallace finished ninth 
and Kevin Prindiville came in 
14th, as the entire Triton line-up 
arrived before any other school 
had three runners across. 

"This team is a very powerful 

team when everyone's popping," 
Triton Head Coach Ted Van 
Arsdale said. "They trust their 
teammates. They could play 
poker with thei r eyes closed." 

"We scored less points two 
years ago," West Regional Athlete 
of thc Year Harder noted; as the 
top five runners earned 19 points, 
compared to the 17 scored in 
Regional Finals in the two previ-
ous years by one of the best 
men's teams in recent memory. 
"But we definitely have one of 
the strongest teams ever." 

For the women, this was defi-
nitely a disappointment. The 
team had struggled to find consis-
tency all year and, unlike the 
men's side, the women had no 
clear hierarchy of runners. 
However, they ran as a group all 
year, and, with a number o(tal-
ented runners and an outstanding 
performance in the CCAA 
Championships, it appeared they 
might break on through to the 
other side. 

"We knew it would be hard, 
hut we all wanted to get back to 
Boston," Kitchen said. "I think 
everyone was let down," 

"This women's team is far 
more powerful than third in the 
region," Van Ar~dale said. "This 
team will learn to win. The taste 
of success is very facilitating." 

For the men, thoughts turn to 
next weekcnd and the champI-
onship course In Beantown, 
which the men ran on early lhi~ 
~ea>on again,t many of the .\amc 
teams thcy will fa~e in the Finals, 
placing fourth . The previous best 
for UCSD in the Finals came in 
1992, when the men garnered 
eighth place. 

Similarly to this season, the 
Tritons ran well last year until 
being overwhelmed in the Finals. 

"The important thing is to bc 
familiar with the course," Van 
Arsdale said . "We've done every-
thing possible in preparation. 
Everybody's equally as fit. It's all 
about who wants it. You've got to 
want to," 

- The Athletic Department 
rea Iized that a ton of you geeks 
never look up from your damn 
computers, so there's even a web-
site full of Triton sports informa-
tion, 

- True to form, we put up a 
website too - although it's slight-

HEROES: 
UCSD to host the 
Quarterfinals, too 
Continued from .,.,e 20 
focused the majority of sets 
towards that hitter, but this week-
end, with everyone swinging well, 
the attacks were spread out, which 
made the UCSD offense much 
more potent. 

In addition to opening up the 
offense, Ebadi led an impressive 
display by serving four aces. lamie 
Hackleman made major usc of her 
time by starting a number of scor-
ing streaks. 

Against Claremont, the benefac-
tor~ of the high-octane Triton 
attack were Dana Salter, Shannon 
Hawes and Allison Bender. 

Salter led the offense with 13 
kills, highlighted by a number of 
untouchahle cross-court shots and 
Bender used her jumping ahi lity to 
go right over the Claremont block . 
At Ihe oppmite position, Hawes 
kept the Athena, off-halam:e with 
her ~outhpaw ~ hot~ as the Trrton!> 
made quick work of their guests. 

Having beaten Chapman in their 
first-round match, La Verne earned 
the right to face UCSD in the 
Regional final with the winner 
advancing to the NCAA 
Quarterfinals.

As I mentioned earlier, our 
women's volleyball team is hosting 
its NCAA Quarterfinal matchup 
THIS SATURDAY AT 7 P.M .! 
Everyone who came out last week-
end for the Regionals saw a domi-

Ebadi served rour straight 
poi nts to open the fi rst game 
against the Leopards. That would 
set the tone for the Tritons, as they 
never allowed La Verne to establish 
any rhythm and won the first game, 
15-4. 

Once again the UCSD attack 
came from all angles, witl] juniors 
Dena Strube and Katherine 
Brynjcstad joining Salter and 
Bender as the major components of 
the offense. 

The second game provided the 
only drama of the weekend for the 
Tritons as UCSD struggled early 
and found itself down by four 
points. 

Two questionable double-con-
tact call, against Ebadi provided a 
Leopard su rge and resulted in a yel-
low ca rd for Ebadi after she 
expressed her displeasure on the 
rulings. 

Her emoti onal outburst seemed 
to wake the slu mbcring Tritons, 
who qUickly knolled the score 
bchind the tough serving of 
Hackleman. Even though UCSD 
wa~ not playing its best vo lleyball , 
the Tritons had enough to hold ofr 
the Leopards to win the second 
game, 15-9. 

"We're a team that plays beller 
with our backs against the wall and 
we realized that this team [La 
Verne] is not one that we should

ting the pi ct ure I'm painting:

about as bruta I as I get) . 

take casually," Noonan said. 
The third game proved to be 

only a formality for the Tritons, as 
the Leopards appeared defeated 
before the start and could not 
match UCSD's talent-laden lineup, 
With the crowd on its feet, the 
Tritons closed out the match and 
the Western Regionals, 15-11 , 

"We played great this weekend 
and I think that as a team we're 
starting to play with a little more 
confidence," Ebadi said. "Going 
into the Quarterfinals, we know 
that if we play well we're capable 
of winning." 

For UCSD, advancing to the 
NCAA Quarterfinals will be a 
chance for redemption, as last 
year's team was eliminated during, 
the quarterfinals. The Tritons will 
face the University of Wisconsin-
Whitewater, a squad they defeated 
at the Trinity (Texas) Tournament 
earlier this season, 

"Even though we have played 
them before, it docsn 't mean a 
whole lot because they've had time 
to improve and wC've had time to 
improve," Noonan said, "Evcry 
learn seems to step up in the ' 
Quarterfinals and [Whitewater] 
will definitely be looking to beat 
the California team." 

The winner of this match will 
advance to the National semifinals 
as part of the Fi nal Four.

Near-Freezing Temperatures 
Can't Stop The Red-Hot Tritons 
FINAL FOUR: UCSD notched its fourth .consecutive National. semifinal 
appearance with a 2-1 victory over Mary Washington College in Virginia 
By Sean Rahlml 
Senior Staff Writer 

The quest goes on for the UCSD 
women's soccer team . Amid frigid 
temperatures hovering around 43 

degrees, a hos-
tile Mary 
Washington 
College crowd 
and a heavy, 
uneven playing 
field , the Tritons 

advanced to their sixth straight 
Final Four with a 2-1 win over the 
Washington Eagles. 

The NCAA Division III 
Championships will be held in 
Elizabethtown, Pa. UCSD will 
match up with Washington 

University (Mo.) in one semifinal 
while host Elizabethtown College 
battles against William Smith 
College. 

This time around, it was the out-
standing play of senior 
defe nde rIm i d fi e Ide r If orw a rd 
Alison Hurley that lifted UCSD to 
victory. Washington scored in the 
29th minute of play to take the 1-0 
lead. 

UCSD - not in the habit of 
trailing in any contest - wasted no 
time knoHing the ballgame two 
minutes later. Hurley found an 
open Yasmin Suarez for the tying 
goal. 

Not satisfied with a mere assist, 
Hurley took matters into her own 

feet seven minutes later, scoring an 
unassisted goal to put her squad up 
2-1. 

UCSD's stellar defense - led 
by sweeper Beth Freeburg and 
company - held down the fort the 
rest of the way, preserving the vic-
tory. 

"They were very tough, very 
physical," Triton Head Coach Brian 
McManus said. "The field was very 
heavy in parts, but they did a good 
job getting it ready." 

UCSD led the battle for corner 
kicks and shots, as it has all season 
long, The Tritons ' plan of attack 
always emphasizes aggressive play 
and tough defense, both of which 
were on display yesterday. 

Fencing Skewers Cal Tech, 
UCLA and ucsa Swordsmen 
ART OF THE DUEL: The Tritons are off to a fabulous start as Suneel 
Sundar, J.anet Wertz and freshman May tal Dayhan are all undefeated 
By Jonah Nisenson 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

The sport of fencing, as you all 
know, sprang from the age-old 
duel. The duel was a way for two 
prideful people to act out their 
aggressions (this was prior to the 
invention of the Sony Playstation). 
A challenge was made and either 
accepted or declined (you were a 

mama 's boy if 
you declined). If 
at.:cepted, the duel 
often resu Ited rn 
death. 

W h i I e 
UCSD's fencing 
team docs not 

u~ually kill it!. 
opponent~ , it does 

take it~ sport very serio u~l y. 
La~t Saturday at Cal Tech 

University iu Pasade na, UCSD 
lOok on club team~ from UCLA, 
UC Santa Barbara and USc. 
UCSD, unlike the teams they faced , 
arc a varsity NCAA-sponsored 
team . The Trrton, ~w()ored inlo 
Pasadena on Saturday and showed 
the club teams why they arc ~trll 
dub teams. 

The Tritons took an overall vic -
tory. going 3-0 in the tournament. 

"We won everything which was 
about what I expected." team cap-
tain David Deeths said. " I would 
have preferred wins by higger mar-
gins, though. If we were really in 
full form, it wouldn' t have been as 
close as it was." 

Fencing is compriscd of five 
divisions within each team. There 
is a men 's foil division, a women 's 
foil division, a men's epee division, 
a women's epee divi~ion and, final -

SLIP: 
Tritons couldn't 
finish off CSULB 
Continued from page 19 
and watched the 4gers play keep 
away. 

The loss erased all memory of a 

Iy, a men's saber division, Each 
men's division has three members, 
while each women's division has 
four members. 

The foil, epee and saber divi -
sions each use different weapons 
and have di fferent rules. 

The foil is smaller than the epee 
and can only be used to hit the 
torso. 

Any part of the body is a legal 
target in the epee division, making 
it very similar to an actual duel 
(except nobody dies). The epee has 
a hell guard above the handle 
which serves to protect the hands , 

In the .,aher division. the saber 
is used to smack the opponent 
ahove the waist as opposed to stid,-
ing hlln wrth the sword puint in the 
other two diVISion>. 

I n all dlvi~ion>, a lame - a con-
lluctive jacket which regi~ters hit~ 
- 1\ u\ed for ~(;Oring . 

rhe three memher~ of each 
men'~ division play the thrce mem-
hers of the opposing team in the 

~amc dlvi~ion and their cumulative 
record dcclde~ the Willner of the 
divhion. The same i~ true for the 

wOlllcn'~ diviSion" except each 
swordsperson must race four oppo-
nents instead of three. 

Against UCLA's club team , 
UCSD won the women's foil, 
women's epee and men 's epee divi -
sions, but lost in the men 's foil and 
mcn 's saber divisions, narrowly 

p~lIing off a 3-2 victory. 
The Tritons fared better agarnst 

UCSB, where th ey won the men's 
epee, men 's saber, womcn's foil 
and women's epee divi ions. The 
only defeat came in the men's foil 
division, but the Tritons still took 

12-7 win over UC Santa Crul the 
night before. UCSD had knocked 
the Banana Slugs around, although 
the game was much closer than the 
Tritons would have liked . 

Kudirka and Beh each scor,ed 
three goals while sophomore Ro ... s 
Mecham ~cored two in the wrnnrng 
cause. 

the 4-1 victory, 
TIle bailie with USC put the 

Tritons on the edge again. UCSD 
gave a strong showing in the 
wOll1en's epee, the men 's saber and 
men 's epee divisions, earning the 
necessary wins to give the Tritons II 
3-2 victory. 

Remarkably, the men's and 
women 's epee teams went unde-
feated in the tournamcnt. In addi-
tion , there were the individual 

standout~ Suneel Sundar (men's 
epee), lanet Wertl (women '~ epee 
team captain) and May tal Dayhan 
(women's epee), all of whom went 
undefeated. 

"In the tournament we were 
undefeated in match play:' Head 
Coach Stuart Lee said. "There i~ 

~t lll a 101 of growth to hc done in 
men" and women ' ~ fni I. We are 

~trong In women 's epee and moder-
ate in men 's saner and mcn'~ epee." 

1llking 22nd place la,t ycal at 
Nationals, the women 's epee team, 
led by Athlete or the Year award-
winner Wert/ , hopes to lead the re~t 
of the ~quad back again thiS ycar. 

The women's foi I team harcly 
lost 10 USC, and beat UCLA and 
UCSB. Its win~ over UCSB and 
UCLA are e~pecially imprcs,ive 
considering two members of the 
squad, Kristin Johnson and Amy 
Weinstein, arc beginners. 

" It was spectacular watching 
Amy and Kristin, they improved a 
little after each bout," said 
women 's foil team captain lulia 
Kulla-Mader. 

Upcoming for the UCSD fenc-
ing team i~ a tournament which 
will be hOMed by UCSD in the 
Main Gym on Sal., ov. 22. 

UCSD will try to forget the los!> 
when it takes to the road for the

Sad Senior Day Send-off 
TOUGH: Successful seniors Pat Beemer, Adam Bollenbach, Romas 
Kudirka and John Borah experienced a bitter 8-7 loss in final home game 
By Jonah NIHMOII 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

The last home game of the year 
should have been a happy time for 
the seniors of the UCSD men's 

water polo team. 
Instead, seniors 
Pat Beemer, 
A dam 
Bollenba c h , 
Romas Kudirka 
and John Borah 
left the game with 
hanging heads 
after an 8-7 loss 

to the No. 10 ranked 4gers of Long 
Beach State University on 
Saturday. 

The sweet taste of a 12-7 victo-
ry Friday night over the Banana 
Slugs of UC Santa Cruz was over-
whelmed Saturday by the biller 
taste of defeat at the hands of the 
4gers. 

In the game against the 4gers, 
the Tritons had all the makings of a 
prize-winner early on, leading at 
the end of the fi rst quarter. 3 -1. and 
at the half, 5-2. Senior hole set 
Romas Kudirka was doing a great 
job of marthandling hi s 4ger 
defender on the offensive end, 
while the Tritons contained Long 
Beach defensively. 

The prize-winner fell apart in 
the second half, however. allowing 
two Long Beach goals in the third 
quarter and answering with only 
one of its own. 

The fourth quarter opened with 
UCSD ahead, 6-4, and searching 
for opportunities to increase its 
lead on the offensive end. The 
Tritons went to the inside game. 
dumping the ball in to Kudirka at 
hole set. But Long Beach State 
knew what was corning. Twice, 
entry passes were dished to 
Kudirka, and twice the ball was 
stolen as 4ger defenders dropped 
on him like flies to assist their hole-
set defender. 

Despite the fact that it looked 
like a futile effort to keep pounding 
the ball inside, the third time down 
the pool was a charm. The Tritons 
again went inside to Kudirka, who 
took the entry pass and held it for a 
moment. With one defender 
already guarding him and a second 
dropping on him, a replay of the 
last two stolen possessions 
appeared imminent. 

Kudirka took over. With his 
back to the goal , he rose out of the 
water and put some mustard on a 
backhand shot that sailed by Long 
Beach State's goalie. 

fired up a two-point goal that 
brought the 4gers to within one and 
changed the momentum of the 
game, 7-6. 

''The big thing that ki lied us 
down the stretch was the two-point-
er they scored after my goal," 
Kudirka said. "It was a big-time 
momentum change." 

The 4gers followed that up with 
two more goals after UCSD Junior 
Doug Cole was majored from the 
game when he received his third 
ejection of the day. They tied the 
game with a goal from Scogin, then 
went ahead with a goal from 
Jeffrey Colyer with I :45 remaining 
on the clock. This left the Tritons 
down by one. 

However, the game was still far 
from over and UCSD knew it. Beh 
and junior Chris Proietti each fired 
outside shots at the goal, but bOlh 
were blocked by Long Beach's 
goalie, ricocheting back into the 
hands of the Tritons. A timely ejec-
tion at 2 meters, drawn by junior 
Bryan Traverso, gave the Tritons a 
six-on-five advantage and an 
opportunity to score. 

SPORTS 19 

At the half, Kudirka had a pair 
of goals out of 2 meters to add to 
sophomore Gordon Beh's nice two· 
point goal with the shot clock run· 
ning out in the first quarter. 

Up 7-4, it ~hould have been the 
back breaker. All the laws of 
momentum pointed in that direc-
tion. On the ensuing possession, 
however, Long Beach's Scogin 

UCSD, of course, worked the 
ball inside to Kudirka, who took a 
quick shot. The ball appeared to 
cross the plane of the goal when the 
Long Beach goalie deflected it, bul 
it went unnoticed by the referees. 
After the controversial no-ca ll, the 
Tritons lost possession of the ball

SUPERPOWER: The 
Tritons swept through the 
NCAA West Regional 
without losing a single game 
By Steve Walsh 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD women 's volleyball team 
hosted and dominated the NCAA Western 
Regionals thi s past weekend, As a result , 

RIMAC underwent a 
transformation from a 
mild-mannered arena to a 
haven for superheroes, 
both on and off the court, 

While the men's vol-
leyball team donned the 

lights and capes of everyone's favorite comic 
book characters in order to lead the Triton 
faithful, the women did everything but leap 
tall buildings as they steamrolled their way' 
into the NCAA National Quarterfinals. Thc 
women dominated Claremont-Mudd-Scripps 
and the University of La Verne, 

Riding the momentum of a record-setting 
regular season, including an 18-game win-
ning streak, the Tritons entered the playoffs 
as the No. 3 ranked team in the nation and 
undefcated against Division IJI opponents. 
Having faced both teams earlier in the year, 
UCSD was never really tested as it swept 
both matches and did not give up more than 
II points in any game. 

"Everything was starting to come togeth-
er for us this weekend," junior middle block-
er Shannon Noonan said. "We started play-
ing like a team, which is something that 
we 've been striving for all year, Everyone 
who came in played 100 percent." 

In the opening match against the 
Claremont Athenas. it was thc Triton defense 
that put togcther a superhero performance as 
it seemingly dug every ball that came across 
the net. With the back row eliminating any 
form of an Athena attack, the UCSD offense 
wa\ ab le to focus on pUlling kills past the 
slruggl ing Claremonl block,
