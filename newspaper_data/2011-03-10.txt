UCSD Police placed ‘No Skateboarding’ signs 
on Library Walk the week of March 3 due to the 
administration’s growing concerns of damage to 
UCSD grounds.

Almost 22 years ago, UCSD agreed to regulate 
skateboarding and other skating devices by en-
acting a policy that would prohibit students from 
skateboarding “irresponsibly on all major campus 
walkways and complexes of UCSD.” 

“There were growing reports that a lot of struc-
tural damage (as a result of skateboards, roller 
skates, etc.), not only disrupted people because 
of the noise skateboards made, but also proved to 
be a financial liability,” UCSD spokesperson Rex 
Graham said. “UCSD administrators felt skating 
needed to be curbed.”

As a result, UCSD administrators, faculty 
members and students voted to regulate skating 
across campus.

According to Graham, the signs were put up 
this week because of the costs involved in paying 
for additional damages caused by skateboards, 
roller skates, in-line skates, foot power scooters 
and others. Policy offenders are allowed a one-time 
warning; repeat offenses result in a citation. The 
costs of these citations are predetermined by San 
Diego municipal court orders. This policy went 
into effect in 2006.

Municipal court orders determine citation 
fines, which can vary.

In addition, the damages would include refur-
bishing and repainting UCSD foundation buildings 
where skateboard tire tracks scar the pavement and 
the building walls on which skateboarding tricks 
are performed.

has been maintaining UCSD’s walkways and path-

Due to possible conflicts in 
scheduling large campuswide 
events, attempts to permanently 
reserve the seventh Friday of Spring 
Quarter as the Sun God Festival date 
have proven unsuccessful. 

Sports Facilities and Programs 
Director Don Chadwick said he 
supports the idea but believes that 
unforeseeable circumstances could 
make institutionalizing the change 
unlikely.

A.S. media liaison Oliver Zhang 
said the main reason Associate 
Vice President of Concerts and 
Events Wong wanted to have the 
seventh Friday of every Spring 
Quarter earmarked is so that other 
departments could plan their events 
around it.

“Brian got a call from Revelle 

College [over the summer] asking 
what date the Sun God Festival was 
so that they could plan their events 
around it,” Zhang said. “Brian could 
not give them an answer.”

Chadwick said UCSD officials 
also want to accommodate the 
seventh week date, but there are also 
other on- and off-campus events 
that may be scheduled during the 
same week, such as regional sports 
conferences. 

“[For] real major events, such as 
the U.S. Open, we will know a few 
years in advance, but most other 
events aren’t like that,” Chadwick 
said. “Suppose our softball team 
does really well one year; we would 
want to be open for some home-
turf post-season games, which are 
usually controlled by the conference 
we’re in.”

Over 100 students ate cake, cookies, pies and muffins at Muir College’s quarterly 
“Stressed is Dessert Backwards” event, held on March 8 to mark finals week.

Winter Triton Festival — the first large-scale 
comedy event to take place at UCSD — will 
happen this Friday, March 11 at 8 p.m. without 
original headliner Donald Glover.

“I know there was concern over losing 
Donald and replacing him with two guys people 
haven’t heard of,” Associate Vice President of 
Concerts and Events Brian Wong said. “But 
there’s a lot of funny people out there — give 

people a shot, come out, enjoy it [and] see it for 
yourself.”

After the A.S. Concerts and Events office 
announced on Feb. 2 that the event would not 
take place on Feb. 5, as was originally schedule, 
the office announced on March 3 that the 
event was rescheduled to the last day of Winter 
Quarter’s Week 10. The office also rebranded 
the event as TGIO:WTF (Thank God it’s Over: 
Winter Triton Festival).

“There are things we just can’t get out of,” 
Wong said. “Regardless of the contract, NBC 

has a lot more buying power than UCSD.”
The performers replacing Glover are 

comedians Nick Thune and Dan Levy.  
Thune has performed on ‘The Tonight 

Show,” had a special on Comedy Central and 
appeared on “Late Night With Jimmy Fallon.” 
He has also played parts in the films“Knocked 
Up” and “Extract.”

Levy has hosted shows with MTV, College 
Humor and Red Bull. He has a role in the 

All six colleges now have a one-quarter, four-unit diversity GE requirement, effective Fall 
Quarter 2011 for incoming freshmen and 
Fall Quarter 2013 for transfer students. 

Currently, only Muir, Revelle, 
Roosevelt, Warren and Marshall have 
cultural diversity requirements. Many 
current cultural diversity GEs — such 
as ETHN 1B (Introduction to Ethnic 
Studies), CGS 2B (Introduction to 
Critical Gender Studies) and POLI 102E 
(Urban Politics) are likely to be included 
on the list of approved classes for the new 
requirement. 

This means most incoming students 
will not have to worry about an increased 
course load. Current students will not be 
affected.

According to the proposal, qualified 
courses will target issues such as race, 

ethnicity, gender, religion, sexuality and 
class, with particular focus on African-
Americans, Asian-Americans, Hispanics, 
American Indians, Pacific Islanders and 
those of other cultures.

On March 1, the Representative 
Assembly of the San Diego Division of 
Academic Senate, which sets graduation 
requirements and determines admission 
requirements, approved the new 
requirement. 

Chancellor Marye Anne Fox also 
approved of the effort at improving 
campus climate following last year’s 
racially themed “Compton Cookout” 
party.

Early Phytoplankton Blooms Impact Marine Life Cycles 
SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY

By Anqi Chen
Staff Writer

Global warming that causes 
sea ice in the Arctic to melt is 
causing the microscopic organism 
phytoplankton to bloom early. This 
may have a drastic impact on the 
marine life food chain and the life 
cycles of different species of fish 
and whales. 

In a collaborative effort with 
NASA and researchers from 
Portugal and Brazil, a team from 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography 
analyzed satellite data and 
discovered that the phytoplankton 
bloomed almost 50 days early in 
some places.

This discovery has raised 
concerns over the effect of the early 
blooms. 

According to biologist Greg 
Mitchell, earlier blooms might 
disrupt the life cycle of key fish 
species or those higher up on 
the food chain, like whales. The 
migration pattern of gray whales to 

the Arctic, for example, is seasonal. 
If the blooming occurs early, there 
may be less food available for whales 
when they arrive, which impacts the 
health of nursing whales and their 
calves. 

“All this is speculative,” Mitchell 
said. “But we do know that the life 
cycles of organisms are timed to 
take advantage of Arctic blooms. If 
they are occurring much earlier, this 
could disrupt these life cycles.”

The earlier the sea ice melts, 
the more sunlight can penetrate, 
creating conditions for the 
phytoplankton to bloom earlier. 

“The issue is that huge impacts 
to the climate can occur with just 
small changes in mean global 
temperature,” Mitchell said. “The 
polar regions in particular will have 
larger impacts.”

To gather the data that led to 
this discovery, project scientist Mati 
Kahru and Mitchell obtained a time 
series of satellite images over the last 
15 years. 

Mitchell obtained approval in 

1996 to use orbiting satellites to 
collect ocean color satellite data. 

The combined time-series of 
Ocean Color Satellite Data could 
only be accurately understood 
in conjunction with on-ship 
observations of ocean ecology. The 
production of chlorophyll, a green 
pigment produced by plants during 
respiration, can be used to build a 
mathematical relationship between 
ocean ecology and the spectral 
reflection of the ocean shown in 
satellite data. 

“Using the time-series data from 
multiple satellites, but especially 
SeaWiFS, and simple statistical 
analysis, we have been able to 
determine the change in timing of 
oceanic blooms,” Mitchell said. 

Kahru and Mitchell, who serves 
as the lead for all the ship-based 
observation programs, are also 
part of ICESCAPE, a NASA Arctic 
research project. Members of the 
program are currently carrying 
out research in order to better 
understand how to propose the 

most effective policies to curb the 
effects of climate change.

“We will continue the satellite 
time series and using data collected 
on ships in the Arctic,” Mitchell 
said. “We will [be able to] improve 
the satellite algorithms and models 
to… advance our understanding 
and move that understanding into 
policy actions.”

The last meeting of the quarter finished in four-and-a-half hours.
Undergraduate Student Parent 

Organization member Alicia 
Kulikowski spoke 
during public 
input to request 
that council create 
a committee for 
undergraduate 
parents to address 
parking needs, 
disproportionate 
increases in rent and family-friendly 
amenities on campus. 

Athletics Committee Chair and 
2009-10 A.S. President Utsav Gupta 
urged council to pass a resolution 
supporting UCSD sports teams 
advancing Division I athletics. 
Council spent an hour debating 
whether the resolution should pass, 
given the necessity of student fees to 
support the effort and current state 
budget cuts. 

President Wafa Ben Hassine 
felt it was irresponsible to pass the 
resolution when many students are 
unable to pay tuition. VP of External 
Affairs Michael Lam and Freshman 
Senator Baldeep Dhaliwal, among 
many others, voiced similar concerns.

Campuswide Senator Anish 
Bhayani noted that during last week’s 
meeting, Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Penny Rue said that she and 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox will look 
for funding outside of school if the 
students are interested. 

Gupta said the resolution gives 
council the opportunity to ask 
students if they would be interested 
in the change and fee increase. He 
also said an approved resolution 
would not mean a fee increase, but 
council suggested an amendment to 
change the language to reflect that a 
referendum would be pursued. With 

the amendment, the resolution then 
passed.

Arts and Humanities Senator 
Shunya Wade was up for 
impeachment for 19.5 unexcused 

absences. Wade 
said she sent 
e-mails stating she 
had a class during 
the meetings she 
missed over the 
past two quarters. 
She apologized 
multiple times 

and began pausing for long periods 
of time in an effort to control her 
emotions. Council then went into an 
hour-long closed session to evaluate 
Wade’s performance. Ultimately, she 
was not impeached.

Council then discussed an issue 
brought up during public input by 
Maria Cardona from the Triton 
Engineering Student Council. TESC 
missed the funding requests deadline 
for Junkyard Derby and Cardona, 
on its behalf, asked council to make 
an exception. Council rejected the 
request, as it had for five other student 
groups who had also missed the 
deadline.

But Cardona pleaded for council 
to give TESC funding, saying “I am 
on my knees, begging you.” Sixth 
College Senator Parminder Sandhu 
and Engineering Senator Adi Singer 
supported TESC, saying council has 
made many exceptions in the past 
and the engineering community is a 
very important, but often overlooked, 
group on campus. 

“We have rules for a reason,” 
Marshall College Senator Thao 
Pham said. Many councilmembers 
echoed similar concerns regarding 
the rules in place for funding student 
organizations. When put to the 
vote, councilmembers voted against 
funding the Junkyard Derby.

Senator Avoids Impeachment

upcoming “A Very Harold & Kumar 
Christmas 3D.” Currently, he is on tour 
with comedian Aziz Ansari, who is on 
“Parks & Recreation.”

“I am excited about Nick Thune, 
Dan Levy and Dat Phan,” Wong said. 
“I think it’s going to be a good show.”

Wong said he reached out to many 
comedy agents, including Glover’s 
agent, to find new performers for the 
comedy event.

Media liaison Oliver Zhang said 
many of the artists pursued for Friday’s 
lineup were unavailable, as the event 
date was too soon.

The show will be held in the Price 
Center West Ballroom since the venue 
can hold up to 1,000 people.  

There has been some controversy 
over the date change being the week 
before finals.

“Yes, it is the week before finals, 
and honestly it should be fun,” Wong 
said. “A nice relaxing break before 
finals week.”

The tickets for the original 
show will be honored at the door. If  
previous tickets are lost, students can 
visit the box office to obtain a new 
one. Concerts and Events is releasing 
additional tickets for individuals who 
did not buy them the first time. A 
ticket is required for entry, but it does 
not guarantee admission.

According to Zhang, the ASCE 
office did not exceed its original budget 
of $31,800 — an amount funded 
entirely by A.S. Council’s mandate 
reserves.

For once, California’s efforts at trimming state education spending don’t include the prospect of a tuition hike. 
With new changes signed into law on 

March 4, all Cal Grant recipients will  have 
their eligibility and award reevaluated every 
year, not just at the beginning of the col-
lege application 
process. If a 
family situation 
arises that could 
potentially lift 
or lower the 
student’s fam-
ily into another 
income bracket, 
the grant will 
be adjusted 
accordingly — a 
move which, according to the San Francisco 
Chronicle, could save the state over $100 mil-
lion per year. 

For most Cal Grant recipients, award 
amounts — based on both individual need 
and total tuition costs — are insufficient to 
cover all expenses. The current requirements 
for a Cal Grant include having demonstrated 
financial need, being registered at a two- or 

four-year college and maintaining at least a 
2.0 GPA at the time of high school gradua-
tion. 

Another change is that Cal Grants will also 
no longer be available for students at schools 
with high loan default rates — namely, for-
profit schools like the Culinary Institute of 
America and San Diego’s Golf Academy of 
America. Students’ eligibility for grants under 
the new proposal will be reviewed on the basis 
of their student default loan rate combined 
with the percentage of students who take out 
loans — in other words, how many students 
can’t pay off their student loans. 

Cal Grant graduation and job placement 
rates factor in the new review process as well, 
in which schools with lower rates will have 
state funds withheld. The grants their stu-
dents lose out on (up to $9,703 a year) will be 
redistributed to students at other California 
colleges. 

The across-the-board cuts to for-profit 
schools will no doubt discourage enrollment 
at those institutions. Vocational training is 
preferable to no education at all, as many have 
neither the time nor the means for a four-year 
college education. Without grants from the 
state, students will be dissuaded from pursu-

ing technical skills that could potentially ben-
efit both themselves and the economy. 

But those for-profit schools under investi-
gation may well prove to be scam operations 
that waste the money of both students and 
taxpayers. In 2010, a government inquiry on 
15 for-profit colleges uncovered deceptive 
practices, including inflating graduation rates 
and falsely guaranteeing students a job after 
graduation. 

A new Cal Grant qualification process 
shouldn’t eliminate grants for all for-profits, 
but should instead evaluate them based on 
their graduation rates, their job placement 
rates, and their year-by-year retention. This 
practice would weed out the bad apples among 
for-profit schools, and channel state funds to 
colleges and students that have greater dem-
onstrated need for financial aid.

 These changes, passed by Governor Jerry 
Brown and the California Legislature, are 
predicted to save the state a total of $124 mil-
lion per year, including the $100 million saved 
with re-adjustment. And while no one wants 
to see cuts to educational funding, in trmming 
the state’s $23 billion deficit, cuts do have to 
be made somewhere; this one just happens to 
represent the least of all prospective evils.

EDiTORiALS

Getting a big sister in your sorority is a little different from getting a biological 
one. The process doesn’t quite take 
nine months, and you also get a little 
more say in the matter. 

I met my Big during the last 
night of recruitment. She kept reach-
ing across me to whack another girl 
with a carnation, and made crude 
faces as we all stood in a circle 
meaningfully looking at each other 
to “see if you can picture yourself 
in a sisterhood with these girls.” 
She was sure that she had creeped 
me out past the point of no return 
— but little did she know, she was 
about to be my Big.

I lucked out, because the trick to 
getting a good Big is actually getting 
to know her by the time everyone 
ranks who they want to create the 
Big-Little bond with (you only get 
three girl-dates to figure out the best 
match). 

Other girls I know got Bigs who 
they only sort of connected with, 
or who are too busy to spend time 
together, or just weren’t as good a 
match as another member of the 
chapter.

I know, it seems a little delu-
sional: Knowing a girl for just a few 
weeks and then declaring her your 
big sister sounds borderline-psychot-
ic a la “Kate’s Addiction.” But, it’s fun 
and it’s nice to have a “sister” who 
doesn’t tattle to Mom and Dad.

The system also has its perks for 
the Big: The “family” relationship 
of a Big and a Little allows the older 
girls to create new bonds. Although 
some girls never see their Big, there 
are always other existing members 
there to assume the older-sister role. 

Once you have a Big, she is 
supposed to make sure you’re not 
wandering around campus looking 
hopelessly for Greek row. She’s there 
to look out for you when you need 
the help.

You engage in Big-Little bonding. 
For my Big and me, that includes: 
wearing gnome pajamas while 
watching “She’s the Man,” photo-
bombing at formals and wearing 
oversize hats at social events to indi-
cate our authority, though the activi-
ties vary by “family.”

Sometimes, they include making 
plans for lunch and then breaking 
them when you both realize you’re 
not as invested in the relationship as 
you’d hoped. Not everyone’s big-little 
relationship is the start of new BFFs, 
but that’s fine too.

Some pairs, like natural relatives 
or an old married couple, even start 
looking like each other after a while. 
Others are reminded of why they 
went to different universities than 
their siblings in the first place. 

At the end of the day, there is no 
gross ritual blood bonding, no lock-
ing us in a room until we braid each 
other’s hair and share our inner-most 
desires — just a healthy jolt into 
choosing a girl to develop a relation-
ship with, who you might end up 
building real bonds with. 

 Next year will be my turn to 
select a Little, and I do plan to creep 
her out on the most crucial night of 
rush week. That will be the test.

Growing Diversity
Last week, the Academic Senate approved a new diversity requirement for all six colleges — one that administrators 
surely hope will help clear the university’s 
good name.

Currently, not all the colleges require a 
diversity GE. Eleanor Roosevelt College cur-
rently has no such requirement, the closest 
class Sixth College mandates is “social con-
text” and Revelle College requires something 
called American cultures.

But effective Fall 2011 for incoming fresh-
men and Fall 2013 for incoming transfers, new 
students  in every college must take a course 
relating to diversity from a list of approved 
classes. For some, this will overlap with exist-
ing cultural diversity requirements, such as 
Marshall College’s Dimensions of Culture GE.

Students can expect a wide range of choic-
es when it comes to satisfying the require-
ment. The approved list already includes 
courses such as HILD 7A and 7C (Race and 
Ethnicity in the United States), LTAF 27 
(African-American Literature) and LTEN 28 
(Introduction to Asian-American Literature). 

The extra requirement may, at best, rep-
resent a collective step away from the kind 

of hurtful ignorance on full display during 
Winter Quarter 2010’s “Compton Cookout.” 
At worst — and here there is real danger — it 
may represent a mere bullet point on the uni-
versity’s PR campaign against “hate and bias,” 
or another proud talking point for campus 
tour guides. 

It’s still early to make definitive judgments 
on how the administration plans to handle 
the new requirement, though the evidence 
isn’t promising. Academic Senate Chair Frank 
Powell said the approved courses will likely 
overlap with existing college requirements — 
a point that will doubtless please incoming 
freshmen, many of whom can already expect 
to spend fully half their time at UCSD fulfill-
ing general requirements. 

But scurrying a new generation of students 
past existing requirements under the guise 
of increased awareness is no answer to the 
problem. If courses like the Dimensions of 
Culture sequence are truly adequate preventa-
tive measures against ignorance or hate, then 
one can’t help but wonder why their impact 
was so absent on the students who committed 
unabashed acts of ignorance last year.

The nature of the particular courses is also 

a concern. Realistically, no general education 
requirement can correct the backward think-
ing of every student who passes through a lec-
ture hall. The best the university can do is to 
ensure that this added requirement is distinct 
from those that failed to thwart the racism on 
display last year, and that the courses required 
actually engage students in issues of race rela-

tions and white privilege. 
That stipulation may sound 

superfluous, but not every supposed 
diversity requirement asks students 
to tackle related issues. A Muir 
College student, for instance, may 
fulfill her diversity requirement with 
an American Sign Language course 
— a useful skill, to be sure, but 
hardly relevant to the events from 
last winter. 

And classes such as Introduction 
to African-American Literature, 
while useful for their relaying of the 
grave historical challenges that the 
black community has faced, often 
engender feelings of detachment in 

the students who need the require-
ment most. These are students who 
disavow themselves of all connection 
to their ancestors’ wrongs, and who 
likely resent the perceived blame 
they receive for them — a resent-
ment that can fuel both ignorance 
and outward acts of hatred.

So though the courses listed may 
satisfy the requirement on paper, it’s 
important to remember the root of 
this proposal: irrefutable evidence 
that our campus is not nearly wel-
coming enough to minority students. 
Accordingly, administrators should 
tailor the requirement specifically to 
issues of race relations. 

The most effective use of the GE 

would be to mandate courses that 
fall under the umbrella of ethnic 
studies — a curriculum that focuses 
on studying ethnic minorities in the 
U.S., ethnic relations and the con-
struction of racial identities. This 
area of study is mostly unconnected 
to current college requirements, and 
would likely have a greater impact 
on those students who can’t see what 
all the fuss is about in the first place. 

Some, of course, will be unmoved 
by the addition to their transcripts. 
But employed properly, the most 
powerful weapon the university has 
in its arsenal against acts of racism 
is not a ceaseless stream of good PR. 
It’s education.

Dear Editor,
In the March 7 issue, I read an 

article about carrying a concealed 
weapon (hereafter referred to as 
CCW). I would like to briefly dispel 
a couple of myths perpetuated by 
the author.

The first myth I would like to 
address is the author’s fear of a situ-
ation like Virginia Tech, where an 
armed professor might not know 
how to use his gun against an 
armed assailant. 

The problem with this train of 
logic is that all people that apply 
for CCW in California must take 
a gun course pursuant to PC sec-
tion 12050(a)(1)(B) and (E) (being 
an off-duty police officer  or active 
duty member of the military works 
too). Thus, anyone who carries a 
concealed weapon legally will be 
knowledgeable enough to know 
how to effectively use a firearm.

Another myth that the article 
indirectly references is that if this 
bill were to come to California and 
pass, just about anyone would be 
able to carry a concealed weapon 
on campus. Once again, I would 
like to reference PC Section 12050 
(specifically part (a)(1)) to bring 
to your attention the qualifications 
of any person that receives a CCW 
permit. 

This section states that only 
people who have “good moral 
character,” “who have completed 
a course of training,” and “where 
good cause exists” for the issuance 
of the CCW permit may obtain a 
CCW permit. Although all three 
qualifications might be slightly 
vague and ambiguous, it would be 
hard to bluff your compliance with 
any of these qualifications.

The author also makes reference 
to the police department’s ability to 
protect students. I would like to call 
into recollection any school shoot-
ing aimed at killing people that was 
stopped by a police officer. Usually, 
the suspect(s) commit(s) suicide 
before the police are able to engage. 

Therefore, having the ability to 
carry a concealed weapon would 
really only cut down on the num-
ber of innocent people killed. For 
instance, had an armed person 
been in a Virginia Tech classroom, 
the shooting there would have 
stopped before the killer was able 
to kill 32 people and then commit 
suicide.

I do agree that getting to the 
root of the problem by checking a 
potential purchaser’s mental stabil-
ity is a step in the right direction.

Nonetheless, I feel that for those 
who are mentally stable, who have 
completed a course of training and 
who have a good cause for carrying 
a concealed weapon ultimately have 
the right to do so. 

While you suggest that allowing 
a CCW on campus would put fur-
ther stress on students, I argue that 
an even greater threat to my stress-
ful life is someone illegally carrying 
a concealed weapon with the intent 
of causing bodily injury.

the council of provosts established 
an advisory committee last year to 
create a course or training program 
that promotes cultural sensitivity.

The Committee on Educational 
Policy will create a group to review 
existing courses and proposals for 
new courses to determine whether 
they satisfy the requirement. 
According to Powell, the review 
will be complete before Fall Quarter 
2011. 

Departments and faculty are 
currently designing new courses for 
the CEP to review and approve. CEP 
is also reviewing existing courses 
that will be included in the course 
catalog for next year’s incoming 
students.

“Many of our students, but not 
all of our students, will already 
have satisfied this requirement,” 
Powell said. “So if you have two 
requirements and this course 
satisfies both of those requirements, 

then you only have to take the 
course once to satisfy both.”

According to Powell, other 
existing courses that are likely 
to satisfy the requirement 
include ANTH 23 (Debating 
Multiculturalism), HILD 7A and 7C 
(Race and Ethnicity in the United 
States) and  LTAF 27 (African-
American Literature). In addition, 
students can also take LTEN 28 
(Introduction to Asian-American 
Literature) and POLI 110EC 
(American Political Thought: 
Contemporary Debates). 

A.S. Council has been supportive 
of the requirement, passing a 
resolution in support of the proposal.  
During voting, two members 
abstained and two opposed.  

“From what I sense, the general 
student body sees this as a small, 
but crucial, step toward fighting 
ignorance and creating a more 
informed and educated campus 
community,” A.S. President Wafa 

Ben Hassine said.
The new requirement has 

generally garnered a positive 
response from students.

“People need to be exposed 
to diversity because they will be 
exposed to it in the real professional 
world,” Muir College sophomore 
Anisha Mocherla said. “Taking 
classes at UCSD will better prepare 
you for it.”

Other students felt that more 
needs to be done.

“I think it’ll be interesting to 
learn about the different ways that 
cultural diversity is perceived, 
but I’m not sure how exactly it’ll 
influence the student body,” Muir 
College sophomore Diana Lu said. “I 
feel that classes might teach you the 
ideas, but cultural diversity should 
be more of an interactive learning 
experience.”

Committee to Review Eligible Courses for Diversity Requirement

ways,” Graham said. “With the deep 
federal cuts, we just simply do not 
have enough resources to make up 
for the costs caused by skateboard-
ing.”

The signs were placed in front of 
Geisel Library, adjacent to the Stu-
dent Health Center and surrounding 
Library Walk, up to the border of the 
School of Medicine campus. 

“I really understand this is quite 
an inconvenience for many stu-
dents,” Graham said. “However, I 
really feel students will be able to 
understand our predicament. With 
that said, however, we will be strict 
in enforcement and immediately 
charge a fine for offenders of the 
policy.”

Since the policy was initially 

implemented in 1989, over 1,232 
fines have been handed to students 
by UCSD Police. About 27 fines in 
total have been handed out in the 
last year. 

“UCSD administrators have 
changed their rulings and have 
stated that UCSD police will enforce 
this policy,” Graham said. 

Many students have complained 
about the implications of the policy, 
and feel that UCSD was being too 
restrictive in regard to transporta-
tion.

“I personally do not like this pol-
icy,” Revelle College freshman Wil-
liam Chang said. “I mean, just look 
around; I see undergrads and grads 
too, who skateboard from one class 
to another. It just doesn’t seem fair.”

Chang said he does not believe 

charging fines will make any signifi-
cant financial difference for UCSD. 

“Skateboarding... contributes to 
openness [at] UCSD, and justifying 
a policy against skateboarding sim-
ply for a financial premise does not 
make sense,” Chang said. 

According to Graham, the policy 
will pay off.

“Students will get frustrated by 
the policy,” Graham said. “But if we 
can collectively make a difference 
for the future, we will see that our 
efforts will be rewarded.”

Graham said he did not have the 
specific details of how much UCSD 
spends per year on repairing struc-
tural damage caused by skateboards.

at vchatur@ucsd.edu.

According to Chadwick, if UCSD 
had to host a post-season game, the 
date of the Sun God Festival would 
have to change, as UCSD would 
not be able to handle the influx of 
visitors.

“The Sun God Festival is just 
so large — with almost 20,000 
participating — that you can’t really 
do much else during that time,” 
Chadwick said. 

Chadwick said he recognizes the 
problems of event planning. 

“We understand the difficulties 
of planning for an event of such 
magnitude and we want to ensure 
seventh week, but sometimes there 
are just [conferences or events] 
beyond our control,” Chadwick said.

Wong has been in contact with 
administrators since the beginning 
of January regarding a tentative hold 
for the festival. 

By the end of February, Chadwick 
decided the move wasn’t feasible, 
though he and Wong established an 
agreement to ensure that the date of 
the festival will be announced by the 
first week of Fall Quarter.

Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Penny Rue and Campus 
Events Manager Alex Kushner told 
Wong that some faculty members 
want to see the Sun God Festival 
moved to a Saturday, because they 
recognize that the Friday event 
encourages students to skip class. 

“There was a push to change 
Sun God to Saturday, but there 
isn’t consensus for this across 
administration,” Zhang said. “One of 
the reasons that some administrators 
want to change Sun God to Saturday 
is that Friday is a school day and 
the festival encourages ditching. 
One way we’re trying to address this 
problem is starting the festival at 2 
p.m. instead of 12 p.m.”

Another benefit of holding 
the concert on a Friday is that it 
deters non-UCSD members 
and community members from 
attending.

“One reason that it should be 
kept on Friday is that there is no 
free parking on Friday,” Zhang said. 
“This helps keep the festival for the 
students. In 2007, we had a lot of [non-
UCSD students] and the majority of 

the arrests 
were of 
[ n o n -
U C S D 
students].”

Hosting 
the event 
on Saturday 
would also 
make it 
difficult for 
the Concert 
and Events 
office to 
clean up 
afterwards.

“ W e 
have an 
agreement 

with RIMAC to return the field by 
Sunday [following the festival] at 
noon,” Zhang said. “If the festival 
were to be held on Saturday, there 
would be no way for us to do the 
clean up and dismantling in time.”

Wong is continuing to negotiate 
with Chadwick to have next year’s 
date of the festival announced before 
the agreed-upon date of the first 
week of Fall Quarter — ideally 
during the summer or the end of the 
previous academic year.

The line-up for the Sun God 
festival will be announced during 
the second week of Spring Quarter.

I usually try to steer clear of mak-ing generalizations about a group of people, but this time I can’t help it: 
Conspiracy theorists are total freaks.

These are the people who believe 
Courtney Love murdered Kurt Cobain. 
They hear alien messages in Jimi 
Hendrix’s Are You Experienced. They 
think that Paul McCartney is dead. 

Let’s stereotype for a second. Those 
who hunt for conspiracies in music usu-
ally have greasy hair. They wear cargo 
pants with too many pockets. They like 
to rant in an obnoxious near-shout. They 
make you feel guilty for listening to pop 
music and for not understanding refer-
ences to drugs recorded backwards on 
vinyl. 

There are websites and books devoted 
to their crackpot theories. The Vigilant 
Citizen site, for example, has devoted 
itself to interpreting the occult symbols 
of pop music and videos. In the Citizen’s 
most infamous article, “Lady Gaga, the 
Illuminati Puppet,” the site asserted that 
the pop icon used references to Fritz 
Lang’s 1927 film “Metropolis” and the 
all-seeing eye (among others) to support 
mind control. 

According to the Citizen, Gaga is “a 
puppet who embodies exactly what the 
public represents in the eyes of the elite: 
mindless drones, mannequins, remote-
controlled robots, hypnotized degener-
ates incapable of thinking coherently.”

I can only imagine what the dude 
who wrote that article is like. He’s prob-
ably a blast at dinner parties. 

“Oh hey, have you seen the ‘Born 
This Way’ video? Weird, right?”

“Ah yes. The references to Baphomet 
were entirely too obvious, but the 
video serves as a prime example of the 
Illuminati agenda.”

Let me italicize for emphasis: really 
fucking weird.

But alas, I am now no better. In 
my fanatical post-King of Limbs bliss I 
discovered the most remarkable theory 
about Radiohead, and I fell for it like 
every Thom Yorke freak on the planet. 

Allow me to explain. Radiohead’s 
2007 hit In Rainbows was released on 
Oct. 10 (10/10), exactly 10 years after 
their 1997 magnum opus, OK Computer. 
Both album titles have exactly 10 letters 
and each album has 10 tracks. After the 
announcement of In Rainbows, the band 
posted 10 cryptic messages on their web 
site — all of which emphasized the let-
ter X (they used phrases like “March 
Wa X” and “Xendless Xurbia”), the 
Roman numeral for 10 — and released 
the album 10 days later. Even the album 
cover for In Rainbows swapped the “i’s” 
and “o’s” in the band’s name for ones and 
zeroes. In fact, the working title for OK 
Computer was actually Zeroes and Ones 
— the mirror image of 10. 

This all adds up, obviously, to one 
clear theory: Radiohead crafted a binary 
code of ones and zeroes across the 
albums, thereby allowing you to com-
bine the two into one decade-spanning 
mega album. To create the trippy playlist, 
just start with the first track from OK 
Computer, “Airbag,” and follow with In 
Rainbows’ track one, “15 Step.” Then, just 
alternate the albums track by track, using 
OK Computer’s “Fitter Happier” as the 
filler between the two halves. 

Finally, add a 10-second crossfade 
between tracks on your iTunes prefer-
ences and begin to trip balls.

PLAYREVIEW

La Jolla Playhouse caps its season with a puzzling but charming 
adaptation of  2006 indie darling “Little Miss Sunshine.” 

By Ren Ebel • Associate Hiatus Editor

I n the realm of quirky independent cinema, 2006’s “Little Miss Sunshine” holds a significant place. The uplifting story of a mismatched Albuquerque fam-ily on the open road combined inspired perfor-
mances with a generous helping of whimsy to melt the 
hearts of moviegoers across the country.

Five years later, Tony winners William Finn and 
James Lapine (“Romance in Hard Times,” “Into the 

Woods”) boldly attempt to catapult 
the critical darling to Broadway heights 
in their musical adaptation, now playing at 
the La Jolla Playhouse. 

“Little Miss Sunshine” follows the Hoover family: 
father and self-help entrepreneur Richard (Hunter 
Foster) and his wife Sheryl (Jennifer Thompson), a 
stressed-out bank teller forced to care for her brother 
Frank (Malcolm Gets) after his attempted suicide. 
With mute, Nietzsche-obsessed teenage son Dwayne 
(Taylor Trensch) and crude, cocaine-snorting 
Grandpa (Dick Latessa), the Hoovers must get 
youngest Olive (Georgi James) to a beauty pageant in 
Southern California. Time to roll out the VW bus.

“Sunshine” takes as many artistic liberties as one 
would expect of a lengthy musical adaptation of an understated Sundance 
slice-of-life. Lapine jumps at any opportunity to expand the film’s character 

backstories and 
minor subplots into full 

musical numbers. 
Often, he’s successful. In the film, 

Grandpa — perverse and hilarious — adamantly advises Dwayne to 
“fuck a lot of women” while he’s still young. In the musical, the conversa-
tion becomes a hysterical, dirty-old-manthem, complete with a slew of 
sexual grievances from Grandpa’s past and an exhaustive use of the word 
“poontang.” Latessa’s spot-on rendition of Alan Arkin’s Academy Award-
winning performance carries the weight of the play’s comedy single-
handedly, making Grandpa’s impending death at the end of Act One that 
much more disappointing. 

Occasionally, however, the musical detours are stretched too thinly 
to maintain much charm or believability. Miss California’s puzzling 
ode to bulimia is neither funny nor enlightening. Uncle Frank’s run-in

bonnie dune: not Just for ‘Gleeks’ 
i f rock bands were football teams, drummers would be  the good ol’ solid defend-
ers, while frontmen are the 
star quarterbacks with flashier, 
crowd-pleasing moves. 

But indie rock up-and-
comers Bonnie Dune subvert 
the formula: Their drummer is 
the quarterback — or, at least, 
he plays one on TV.

 Cory Monteith, the actor 
behind affable singing football 
player Finn Hudson on the 
wildly successful musical com-
edy “Glee,” is the man behind 
Bonnie Dune’s kit. But unlike 
his primetime character, he isn’t 
the ringleader of the group. 

That doesn’t mean ‘gleeks’ 
aren’t snatching up tickets to all 
of their shows. Their very first 
gig at the Roxy in January sold 
out, and they’ve continued to 

pack venues across California 
— including the Loft, where 
they’ll be headlining next 
Sunday. 

The Guardian caught up 
with Justin Wilczynski, the 
band’s lead singer, to chat about 
playing in Finn Hudson’s shad-
ow and the burgeoning group’s 
pre-show jitters.

“It’s been really great that 
kids have been coming out to 
support Cory,” Wilczynski said. 
“I feel like once we get them 
out to the show and they hear 
the music, I hope it organically 
starts to become more about 
Bonnie Dune as a band, rather 
than just coming to see the guy 
from ‘Glee’ play the drums. I 
think it’s hard to expose people 
to new music these days, and 
if that’s how we’re going to get 
people to the show, hopefully 

the music keeps them coming.”
Bonnie Dune started as a 

songwriting project between 
Wilczynski and childhood 
friend Jason Massey (who now 
helps produce and co-write the 
band’s tracks). After moving 
from Paso Robles (just out-
side San Luis Obispo) to Los 
Angeles, they intended to start 
the band, but those plans came 
to a halt when Massey got a job 
in Nashville as a country song-
writer. Instead of going forward 
on the project, Wilczynski took 
a stab at acting. 

“I went to a casting with a 
friend for a Target commercial 
audition,” Wilczynski said. “I 
was just along for the ride, but 
while I was there, they asked 
me to audition. I said no; I was 

LA band rocks famous 
drummer, but the group 
isn’t all about Hollywood.

8 THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, MARCH 10, 2010 HIATUS

N ot too long ago, in a mystical land far, far away (Canada), the cast and crew of  “Red Riding Hood” came together 
to film a sexed-up version of a storybook 
classic with “Twilight” director Catherine 
Hardwicke at the helm. 

But Hardwicke seems 
to have forgotten that she’s 
not in Forks anymore. 
Like “Twilight,” her latest 
opens in a small, isolated, 
perpetually overcast vil-
lage.  Here, Valerie (a wide-
eyed Amanda Seyfried) 
is torn between two boys 

(Max Irons and Shiloh Fernandez) — one 
of whom just might be the werewolf that’s 
plaguing the town. 

To keep things interesting (or dodge 
copyright issues) a professional werewolf 
hunter, Solomon (a purple velour-clad Gary 
Oldman — that’s right, velour), arrives to 
tell the village that the beast lives among 
them. When the creature attacks once more, 
the peasants spiral into panic;  meanwhile, 
Valerie, ever-serious, flirts with both suitors. 
The town continues on in whodunit hysteria 
while Solomon scrambles to uncover the 
werewolf ’s human identity. 

By spending absurd periods of time play-
ing to teenyboppers,  “Red Riding Hood” 
loses the cross-generational appeal that’s 
inherent to the much-beloved original.  
Hardwicke (further shackled by screenwriter 

David Johnson) treats her audience like bub-
blegum-brained morons: Actors sport over-
wrought expressions, bodies are tense with 
heightened faux emotion (the terse Madame 
Lazar, played by Christine Willes, seems to 
be suffering from irritable bowel syndrome), 
characters announce their thoughts and 
intentions and the plot — unable to support 
itself on its own feeble legs — is propelled 
forward entirely by clunky dialogue. 

Despite the reliance on monologue, char-
acters are woefully insubstantial. Outside 
Valerie’s persistent concern for her lovers 
and family, she’s a veritable stranger — her 
likes, dislikes and motivations remain a 
mystery. 

Not satisfied with gauche dialogue and 
acting, Hardwicke’s camera pans around 

scenes erratically, inexpertly avoiding blood 
by rapidly cutting away from the murdered 
with nauseating speed, swapping from 
handheld to fixed shots and punctuating 
the vertigo with absurd close-ups of pained 
actors. Worse, the movie’s inconsistent pac-
ing elongates the torture; it alternates sud-
denly between a frantic rush and a turtle’s 
pace for apparently infinite periods of time, 
as the camera lovingly examines every facet 
of Seyfried’s and Fernandez’s too-close mugs. 
The romance scenes are sexless and uncom-
fortable at best.

After the camera pans over Seyfried’s 
peepers in excruciating slow-mo for the fifth 
time (clocked in at around the 20-minute 
mark), it becomes clear: This flick is just a 
15-year-old in wolve’s clothing.

ALBUMREVIEW

I t’s never a good sign when an artist publicly expresses distaste for his unreleased album. Or worse, when that same artist says that he was 
contemplating suicide while working on it.  

Needless to say, this hasn’t been a good year for 
Lupe Fiasco.

While working on his third studio album, 
Lasers (a name interestingly divested of the sense 
of ownership proudly displayed on the rapper’s 
past two albums, Lupe Fiasco’s Food and Liquor 
and Lupe Fiasco’s The Cool), Fiasco fought with his 
label, Atlantic Records, for creative control. Those 
struggles manifested throughout the album, creat-
ing a musical dichotomy; Lupe spits best on the 
tracks that are unlistenable, boasting with over-
produced bravado that frequently degenerates into 
incoherent white noise. 

“State Run Radio (ft. Matt Mahaffey)” is a gui-
tar-heavy mess; the rifts keep coming, intertwin-
ing with an auto-tuned, Teletubby-like Mahaffey. 
Suddenly the beat jerks away, leaving a deadening 
vacuum of tinkling as Fiasco spits rhymes. The 
effect is akin to a musical hangover worse than one 
achieved after a night of guzzling tequila.

On the other half of the album, presumably 
the parts more influenced by his label, Fiasco raps 
in a dull monotone, as the Top-40 production 
rushes ahead without him. Despite the artist’s clear 
disinterest, these tracks are some of the most suc-
cessful. Single “The Show Goes On” touts a frenetic 
electronic horn and slow beat that quickens at the 
break into every hook, overlaid by the same care-
free, buttery vocal aesthetic that won Fiasco plati-
num on “Superstar.” 

Sadly, the album works best when Fiasco turns 
down the theatrics. For longtime fans of the Chi-
town native, it’s a definite fiasco — just not the one 
they know best.

HIATUS THURSDAY, MARCH 10, 2010 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 9

After enough bong rips, the songs actually 
sound like they were meant to be played this way. 
The four drum beats at the end of  “Airbag” set 
the new tempo for “15 Step”; the reverb from 
“Subterranean Homesick Alien” lingers into “Nude.” 
Lyrical themes even emerge from one song to the 
next (though ideas of paranoia and anxiety are 
prevalent among all of their work, and may also be 
amplified by your substance of choice). 

Theories aren’t new to the band, either; Chuck 
Klosterman famously wrote of Kid A’s peculiar 
prediction of 9/11 in his book “Killing Yourself to 
Live,” and the band even hid a booklet underneath 
the case of that album, which included lyrics that 
would appear on future releases Amnesiac and Hail 
to the Thief.

It’s likely that Thom Yorke and co. are just fuck-
ing with their fans’ propensity for overanalysis. 
Either way, my listening habits have been destroyed. 
Goodbye sweet normalcy, hello listening to every 
record I own backwards (just in case). But hey, at 
least I have a small sense of pride in knowing that I 
will always opt for skinny jeans over cargo pants.

kind of embarrassed. But they talked me into 
it, and I auditioned. I got a call back and then 
I booked it. That ended up being a really big 
Target campaign… Ever since then I’ve never 
had a real job.” 

Wilczynski then got involved with “Kaya,” 
a short-lived scripted MTV show about musi-
cians, where he met Cory Monteith. 

“Organically, Cory and I became good 
friends writing music together and we really 
connected,” Wilczynski said. “After he started 
working on ‘Glee,’ he kept telling me he wanted 
to start playing music again. Cory was kind 
of the inspiration for getting the band back 
together; he really wanted to set aside time and 
start this band.”

With bassist Joshua Kerr and guitarist Seth 
Roberts on board, the foursome got together to 
run through their first song. It clicked. 

“It sounded perfect,” Wilczynski said. “We 
all looked at each other and were in shock. We 
knew this was our band.” 

The band has taken to playing live just as 
quickly, though not without any initial nerves. 
At one of their first shows at Chain Reaction in 
Anaheim, the guys found the perfect solution.

 “We got together in the bathroom because 
there were so many people backstage,” 
Wilczynski said. “We ran through a couple 
songs together, singing and having fun, and we 
knew there was nothing to worry about. So now 
before we play shows, we’ll go backstage and the 
four of us will sit down and have a little acoustic 
jam sesh.” 

With pre-show jitters out of the way, 
Wilczynski says the band has a blast on stage. 

“I think when we play, we have more fun 
than anyone else at the show,” Wilczynski said. 
“I’ve been in bands where it gets to a point 
when you become obsessed with how many 
people like you… and we didn’t want it to be 
like that at all. If the kids show up, it’s great. 
And if they don’t, we’re going to have a good 
time anyway.” 

Wilczynski said he hopes to get an album 
out later this year.

 “We’re writing a lot of new songs right now,” 
he said. “We’re looking to play as many shows as 
possible, to see which songs work. Once we feel 
like we have a really strong set list, we’ll record 
them.”

Bonnie Dune will headline a sold-out show at 
the Loft this Sunday, March 13, at 7 p.m.

with his ex-lover’s new fiancé vies desper-
ately for laughs, but in doing so abandons 
the film’s heartbreaking realism (not to 
mention downplays Frank’s attempted 
suicide). 

The script runs aground when it 
strays from the film entirely, attempting 
lame contemporary references (the pag-
eant’s host takes a stab at Justin Bieber), 
incongruous social commentary (a family 
of presumed illegal immigrants scurry 
past the Hoovers in Arizona), and what-
ever the hell that pedophilic policeman at 
the end was supposed to be. 

But “Little Miss Sunshine” never loses 
our attention, partly because there’s so 
much going on visually. David Korins’ 
stunning sets include a life-size yellow 
Volkswagen bus, a massive neon filling 
station and an elaborate recreation of 
Redondo Beach that employs a giant, 
rotating tent top. 

The talented actors help to steer the 
play clear of tedium. Thompson and 
Foster shine as mom and dad, balancing 
three-dimensional character acting with 
impressive vocal range, while Gets proves 
particularly successful in reproducing 
Steve Carell’s wryly funny Uncle Frank.

Still, it’s easy to wonder whether this 
little dramedy ever belonged on the stage. 
Though the music is engrossing, the 
characters are most insightful and affect-
ing when they aren’t singing. Richard 
Hoover’s grandiose opening seminar for 
his “Ten Steps for Success” program is 
amusing, yet fails to capture the depth 
of the desperate, unlikeable and entirely 
human patriarch of the film. 

As a bit of light, smiling entertain-
ment, “Little Miss Sunshine” is an 
achievement. It’s never as humorous or 
moving as its source material, but it never 
claims to be. The production’s content 
is an enjoyable homage to a great film, 
never transcending the sum of its excel-
lent parts.

participation, performance and sportsman-
ship at the Southern California Intercollegiate 
Championships in November.

The Triton women’s tennis team continued its 
improved form, sweeping Villanova and Western 
New Mexico on Friday and Tuesday, but fell to 
Rollins College on Sunday.

Every match went to the Tritons against 
Villanova on March 4  in the 9-0 victory. Taskeen 
Bains led the way with a 6-2, 6-2 victory, and 
Cindy Dao produced a 6-1, 6-0. Head coach 
Liz LaPlante said Dao, a senior, has performed 
impressively this season. 

“She’s played extremely well,” LaPlante said. 
“It’s the best she’s played and, as a senior, it’s 
great.”

The team struggled against Rollins on Sunday, 
falling 2-7, with the two victories coming from 

the doubles side.  Bains and Haley Perrotte won 
their match 8-4, while Katie Mulloy and Roxanna 
Pourmirzaie won their match 8-5.

On Tuesday, the Tritons crushed Western 
New Mexico, defeating them 9-0. The team was 
led once again by Bains and Dao, who won 6-1, 
6-0 and 6-0, 6-0, respectively.

The team will face Cal State Stanislaus on 
Saturday at UCSD, before having a break until 
April 1.  LaPlante said she is happy with the team’s 
improved play.

“We’ve been playing better lately; things are 
starting to come into form,” LaPlante said.

The Triton men return to action against 
Barry on Friday, Hawaii Pacific on Saturday and 
Lafayette on Sunday, all at UCSD. 

Readers can contact Jonathan Kaslow at jkaslow@

March Madness is perhaps the purest event 
left in all of sports (John Calipari-coached 
teams aside). There’s nothing more exciting 
than seeing Northern Iowa take down a No. 1 
seed, or a school like Butler or George Mason 
making a Cinderella run to the Final Four. But 
the first two rounds always take place during 
Winter Quarter finals — literally, as many 
games happen in the middle of the day. I’ve 
skipped my final hours of studying several 
times to watch an upset, and more than once 
I’ve regretted it immediately after when I was 
handed my final exam. 

The phenomenon returns during Spring 
Quarter, when NBA finals take place during 
Week 10 and finals week. These are a little 
better for our schedule, since they are always 
primetime games, but everyone has had at 
least one night final on a night you wished you 
didn’t. Plus, watching a game nearly always 
becomes a much longer study break then you 
intended 

Gunners Down to 10 Men....Then 9

When Arsenal faced Barcelona in their 
Champions League clash on Tuesday night, 
the Gunners faced the near-impossible task 
of beating the Spanish champions with fewer 
than 11 men on the field. Things got even 
worse for the London club in the 56th minute, 
with the controversial sending off of Robin 
van Persie.

The official’s report will show that Arsenal 
ended the game with 10 men, but I would 
contend that they started with that many. 
That’s right: Barcelona born-and-raised Cesc 
Fabregas played the entire match for his home-
town club despite being the Gunners talisman 
and captain.

Fabregas was nearly lured back to Catalonia 
last summer, with two clubs playing countless 
mind games. Fab himself did quite a bit of 
flirting with the idea, spurred on by the good 
feelings from having just won the World Cup 
with Spain. In the end, he committed himself 
to Arsenal for one more year with the unspo-
ken but well-understood intention of rejoin-
ing his boyhood club this summer when his 
contract expires. 

But the atmosphere at Camp Nou must 

have proven too much for Cesc. Maybe it was 
the cheering of over 95,000 of his country-
men, or the sight of so many of his Spanish 
national teammates in the other jersey. Maybe 
he couldn’t stand the thought of sending his 
beloved Barca out of the Champions League in 
the first knockout stage. Whatever it was, Fab 
made sure his Arsenal weren’t going through 
to the next round.

The game’s opening goal featured some 
slick passing, as Fabregas sent a nifty back heel 
to Iniesta, who sent Leo Messi through on goal 
for a class finish. The only thing missing was 
Fabregas joining in on the goal celebration.

Normally the heartbeat of the Arsenal 
midfield, Fab shirked his duties and left 
all the work to 18-year-old Jack Wilshere. 
The Englishman did his best, but the odds 
were against him, with his midfield partner 
nowhere to be found. He was subbed out far 
too late, and his bowed head as he walked out 
led me to wonder if he felt some guilt for his 
sabotage. Arsenal fans can rest assured now 
that Fabregas will always love Barcelona the 
best, and they won’t have to feel so bad seeing 
him go this summer. 

Next Seven Matches at Home for Triton Men

Though van Persie Sending Off  Unfair, Blame Falls on Fabregas’s Shoulders

Today, the remnants of the ring sit 
below the RIMAC complex, a founda-
tion of the athletics program here at 
UCSD.

As the track team goes to the All-
California Invitational this weekend, 
we all carry the controlled recklessness 
from sleepless nights and hours of prac-
tice that embodies the spirit of athletes 
past and present from our university, 
and points us in the direction of great-
ness.

For me, it’s not much of a calm 
before the storm, and I can’t do anything 
but wait in frustration. Once the storm 
hits, it’s just a matter of riding it out so 
that I can control it and mold to my 
will. It’s that control that makes a great 
athlete.

Sophomore Austin West has yet to drop a singles match this season.

Basketball and the Quarter System

For me, the worst thing about the quarter 
system isn’t the frenetic pace or frequent mid-
terms and finals. Instead, it is the alignment 

of finals week with the best weeks to be a bas-
ketball fan: the opening rounds of the NCAA 
tournament and the NBA finals.

The UCSD men’s tennis team continued its scorch-ing start to the season with two more wins, defeat-ing Claremont-Mudd-Scripps and Western New 
Mexico.

The match against Claremont-Mudd-Scripps was 
hard-fought, but the Tritons pulled out the 5-4 victory, 
handing the Stags their first loss of the season. Erik Elliott 
and Chapman Chan led the way in singles, with Elliott 
winning easily 6-4, 6-2 and Chan coming back to win 
4-6, 6-1, 6-4.  Austin West and Max Jiganti also won their 
respective singles matches 6-3, 7-5 and 6-3, 6-1.

On the doubles side, West and Elliott won the No. 1 
spot 8-2 to secure the victory for the Tritons.

On Tuesday, the Tritons defeated Western New 
Mexico 6-3 for their 10th straight win to open the sea-
son.  Elliott and Chan continued to dominate singles, 
winning 7-5, 6-1 and 3-6, 6-2, 8-7 respectively. West and 

Jiganti also won their singles matches 6-1, 6-1 and 6-3, 
6-1.  Elliott and West won their doubles match 8-6, while 
Chan and Jason Wall won their doubles match 8-2.  

Several men’s players participated in the 122nd 
Pacific Coast Doubles Championships. All the doubles 
teams won their first-round matches, but only one made 
it any further.  The team of Jiganti and Dutreix won three 
matches but fell in the third round.  Two of their victories 
came from opponents withdrawing, but they did win 
one match before falling in a competitive 6-4, 4-6, 6-1 
to Adam Davison and Eric Kruetzer of Boston College.

The team received an off-the-court boost on Monday, 
as the United States Tennis Association of Southern 
California presented the annual Long Ellis Award to 
the team on Monday. The award is given based on

TENNIS

The calm before the storm is always the hardest thing for me to weather. I can’t sleep 
for fear of missing the bus, can’t 
stop worrying about how much I 
need to sleep and can’t stop going 
over the game plan for tomorrow — 
or in some cases, later that day, as I 
stay up through the night. 

There is always a time for ner-
vousness for athletes. If you’re not 
nervous, you’re one of three things: 
you’re not ready for competition 
and are distracted, you suck or 
you’re so confident of victory you 
can be cocky and not perform as 
well as you might while getting 
away with a win (Usain Bolt, any-
one?). But even Olympic athletes, 
Bolt included, get nervous. 

In fact, this can separate a good 
athlete from a great athlete. Good 
athletes get nervous and perform 
despite these emotions  — ignor-
ing them entirely — or deal with 
them by getting angry or amped up 
enough to get things done. 

Neither of those mindsets will 
put you at the top of your game, but 
dealing with it the right way is an 
intangible. Intangibles like this are 
all over sports, whether it’s hand-
eye coordination, bat speed in base-
ball or the ability to read the court 
faster than anyone else. People just 
have it or they don’t. The feeling 
is something hard to teach. It’s a 
simple thing you have to be born 
with or build every day over time. 

This is why the night before 
the game is so hard for me. I am 
nervous as a cat on a sinking ship. 
I know what’s coming, I know I 
can swim and I know I will survive. 
But the anxiety of when and how is 
unbearable. 

I let the anxiety build inside me 
and let it run its course through 
the night. I fight with myself, and 
come through the next day with the 
anxiety beaten into shape. It doesn’t 
come to the surface as I step on the 
bus, arrive at the meet and stare 
down the runway: The emotions 
are bottled and ready, not forgotten 
entirely, just there for when I need 
to use them.

A class of UCSD track and field 
athletes knew this feeling years ago. 
Back when UCSD athletics were 
smaller and RIMAC just a grassy 
hill, they called this feeling “con-
trolled recklessness.”  They learned 
to control their emotions to help 
them in their performance, aiding 
them in the move from Division III 
to Division II and remaining com-
petitive on the national level. These 
same throwers poured concrete one 
weekend and made a shot and dis-
cus ring where RIMAC now sits, 
each thrower putting his handprint 
along the outside of the ring, with 
“CONTROLLED RECKLESSNESS” 
printed at the back. The following 
Monday, athletics department offi-
cials found the ring, scratched their 
heads, and figured it could stay. The 
team had gotten the job done faster 
than the university could have, and 
it would have been more trouble to 
remove the ring than it was worth. 

Triton men still undefeated at 10-0, while women improve to .500 with 
shutouts of Villanova and Western New Mexico.
