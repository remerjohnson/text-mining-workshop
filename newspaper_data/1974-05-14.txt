"No Rational Leadership" 

UC 'Provost' May Be Appointed 
by RobertOi Rehm 

Major changes will occur 
in the top echelons of the 
U.c. administration if a 
proposal to create a new 
admi nistrative post, 
University Provost, is 
approved when the Board 
of Regents meets May 16 
and 17 in Los Angeles. 
Areas most affected will be 
academic and budget 
planning. 

If the plan is approved, 
David S. Saxon, new 
Executive Vice Chancellor 
at UCLA, will assume the 
Provost's job. Saxon will try 
to relate long range 
academic planning to 
available budget resources . 
To start with Saxon will 
keep some of his UCLA 
duties and work at the new 
position only half time. 

Duties of various other 
U.c. officials will be re-
distributed among existing 
pos itions with several 
personal changes likely to 
occur. 

Dr Paul altman , UCSD 
Vice Chancellor for 
AcademiC Affairs, told the 
TRITON TIMES Friday that 
these changes are a result of 
"no rational leadership" in 
the UC administration . He 
said that there has been " no 
central planning with 
regards to the tructure and 
function" of the university 
system . 

Sa ltman called the 
creation of the University 
Provost position , Ita positive 
move on the part of 
President Hitch . It brings to 
University Hall (UC's 

headquarters, located in 
Berkeley) one of the most 
capable of academians . 
Dave Saxon is a remarkable 
guy." 

There won't be any short 
term payoffs," said Salt-
man, but Saxon "is tough, 
he's willing to make 
decisions and to stick with 
them." Saxon, he said, 
"understands the structure 
and function of the 
University of California . 
He's knowledgable in 
academic planning and has 
an understanding of high 
quality undergraduate and 
graduate education ." 

Current proposal s fO.r 
change in the UC ad-
ministration came about at 
least in part, because ' of 
"unrest among the chan-
cellors first, then the other 
administrators and vice 
chancellors," said Saltman . 
I n an attempt to "short 
circu)t the tati c and nois " 
oming from the central UC 

administration, Saltman 
said that several vice 

han c Ilor from the 
various ca mpuses have 
" taken the initiative" and 
have b en meeting 
regularly to discuss mutual 
problems in areas such as 
library dev lopment , 
computer sharing, and 
Intercampus faculty 
transfers. He feels that they 
have become " a powerful 
force" though they were not 
directly involved in the 
current reform proposals. 

The Los Angeles Times, 
writing about the ad-
ministrative cha nges , 
quotes a "well -informed 

source" that said, "The 
statewide administration 
has been squeezed between 
demands of the campuses 
on the one hand and the 
demands of the legislature 
and the public on the other 
and the operation wa~ 
starting to come apart." 

Saltman agreed that there 

are differences between the 
governor and the university. 
He said that the legislature 
and the governor are 
worried that the system is 
too expemive and may be 
becoming "an elitist in-
stitution" while the people 
are " Iiving in the mentality

Amid Protest, CEP Repasses GP Motion I 
by Paul Osterman III In addition, there will be more work for the professors 

Despite opposition from most of the hundred 
stu?ents present at the Committee on Educational 
Potrcy (CE~) meeting last Thursday, the CEP Friday 
passed a slightly amended proposal to revise UCSD's 

~resent grading system to include the plus minus op-
tion . 
. The proposal now goes to the Academic Senate for 

final conSideration on June 4. 
Sli~htly reminiscent of Berkeley City Council 

meetings, the Thursday night meeting was held in 
accordance with an April 30 Academic Senate direction . 
The CEP approved the grading policy inclusive of the 

pl~s minus feature . The final proposal contai ns only 
mrnor changes from the original. 

F.ollowing student recommendation , the CEP and the 
registrars office will conduct a campus-wide student 
poll dealing specifically with the plus minus feature. 
Results of the poll will be presented to the AS in June. 

Although a half-dozen recommendations were made 
?y stud~n.t~ Thursday night, only one, faculty 
Irresponslbrllty, was dealt with by the CEP on Friday 
b fore approving the grading proposal. 

Rec~mme~dations included a plus minus option, a 
pass-farl option for all classes, a campus-wide student 
poll , research to see how the plus-minus feature has 
worked at other institutions, consultation with the Vice 
Chancellor and Dean of Student Affairs and a review of 
the entire grading system . ' 

The general student response Thursday night was that 
the plus minus feature would put unnecessary and 
additional emphasis on grades. Larry Deckel , Triton 
Times Arts editor and student at Revelle, said,"This 
school is competitive enough already, and the plus 
minus system will make UCSD even more competitive. 

since there will be more cause for argument." 
Deckel commented further, saying, " It will make 

UCSD not congruous with the UC system and other 
colleges, and there will be more emphasis on getting 
grades, rather than on learning ." Deckel received the 
first of many rounds of applause. 

A~~t~er student s~eaking against the feature argued 
that t hiS movement IS one of walking backwards rather 
than forwards." Other students comments were : " With 
the added emphasis that pluses and minuses will put on 
grades, students may begin to think that grades do 
measure something"; " It's a totally insane idea'" "~ef~n it.el~, a ~etter and newer set of whips"; "Simply 
nit-picking ; Grades are only for Grad school or 
motivation ." 

Dr. Bob Heifetz wondered if the newly approved 
system would be " keeping with a more suitable learning 
environment" 

.Professor Paul Chapin spoke in favor of the plus 
minus feature, " It will allow extra flexibility" he stated 
"The present system is too gross to di~ide various 

~tudents' work into ." Chapin apparently feels that the 
new feature will prOVide for more categorrzatlon of 
students. 

Later in the meeting Chapin addressed the Issue of the 
P-NP grade Preceding a tumultuous round of applause 
Chapin commented, " Students should have the option 
to go P-NP as long as they can drop a class ." 

CEP member, Professor Newmark commented befc . .: 
the meeting broke saying, " the consensus here is against 
the plus minus issue. I know I wi ll be affected and I 
know my own view. But I've never seen a syst~m that 
didn 't hurt anybody . This proposal is not the CEP's 
position . Let it go to the Senate and do your lobbying."

A Strange Tale 
You' ll have to bear with me thro ugh this . It was, you 

realize, very late. 
I was walk ing around in the Mu ir academic buildings, 

intending to prove that a give n departm e nt is 
c haract e rized by the th ings the professors and T Ns put, 
or do not put, on the ir doors . 

Apart from certain extremes, li ke the Ant hropology 
departme nt , upon whose doors the re was absolutely 
nothing at a ll , or th e Li t e rature depa rtment, which won 
the prize fo r the most Peanuts cartoons per capita , the 
trends that developed we re not what I expected . 

I had expected very little from the Li ng uis tlcs 
Departme nt, for exam ple, proba bly beca use of a 
p revious b ias to the effect that do o r decorations be 
a lways, visua l It had never occured to me that linguists: 
w ho must be more in love with wo rds (perh a ps thei r 
t ructure and relat ionsh ips to o the r words more than 

t heir literary en es) than anyone, would have th e most 
interesting doors. I was pleasantly surprised 

One door was la be lled the "Alsatio-Columbian In-
s t itute of Armalayan and Patagonian Cryotheo ophy 
and Lumbar Gyrophrastics " On the same door was 
Grommet's Hypothesis (it was Grommet's Door) which 
he ld, if I may paraphrase, that the aspects of a language 
t hat contrad ict all tbe ru les a li ngust knows will 
probably prove to be u niversal. Which fascinates me 
for some rea son. ' 

The second most interesting door had the following 
clipped from a paper and labe lled 'Your Proble~ 
Solved': "Dear Heloi se : When you are taking eggs from 
a carton , dampen your fingert ips and the eggs will be 
e asier to p ick up ." It was signed 'Mrs. Davidson ' . 

However, we mus t leave the linguists and mo ve to 
the core of th is story, wh ich is the Psychology 
Department. 

I had, naively, hoped for great th ings from the 
Psychology department 's doors-all sorts of mind games 
shocking statistical charts and tables, and ink blots that 
would toy with the edges of my psyche. 

There was , however, just the usual proliferat ion of 
Pe anuts a nd Doonseberry c utouts, and disappointi ngly, 
a number o f streaking jokes . In fact, the most inte rest ing 
th ing, on the UPPER floors of the bU ilding, was a sign 
hanging fro m a door (this is midn ight Friday, reme mber) 
th at read 'Expe riment in Progress'. It was the sort of 
in san ity I'd been looking for,and I gleefull y knocked on 
th e door. 

No one answered, so I left . Which bri ngs me, fi nally, 
to my poi nt . 

I was in the basement of 2C-Prime, wandering a long 
de jectedly, when, in Room B-128 I saw at least 100 
c hickens. (That is, I think they \" e re c h ickens. In any 
case, they will be hereafte r referred to as 'chic kem.l 
They were in separate, stacked cages, and all faced the 
sam e way, whic h dis turbed me most of all . They se emed 
unable to turn around In the ir cages- All they could do , 
rea ll y, was si t a nd squawk a t each o ther. 

As I was sta nd ing the re, looki ng at the chicke ns, a 
man came da rt ing out of the next room , looked a t me 
fa n atically, and disappeared into ano ther room down 
the hall , from which, a few moments late r, cam e a f ierce 
bUZZing I deeply feared what I had discovered . 

I left then, but returned later with two frie nds, hopi ng 
to document my observat ions before an y further ac t ion 
(I brought two, just in case something were to happen to 
one of them You see, I had come to be lieve the worst-
the psychology department is tinkeri ng With the mi nds 
of those chickens toward unspeakable e nds, and they 
would do anything to prevent fa il ure) 

eedless to say, when we got there the doo r was 
locked, the man gone and the buz zi ng si lenc d I 
knocked on the door, hopi ng to wake one of the 
hicken5 '0 he could I t us In . My fr iends looked a t me 

susp lcic usl y 
"Ch lck~ns?" 
" Yes, :here we re chickens. Hundreds of them. Ask th is 

woman here " I went running down the hall afte r a 
c lea n ln! wom.J n who had dpJ,l t::"r'€d Jrcunrl thf' corn r. 
"Whe rp are the chicke ns?" I asked. 

At fi r,t, she looked shocked . I wasn ' t supposed to 
know ":hlckens? Yeah, we get alot of c hickens aro und 
he rE' " 

I ash·d a ll the Janitors that were prowl ing around In 
thE' basl'ments, but they a ll laugh d at m And no w, my

Capitalism for Worse by Paul Sweezy 
The following article il reprinted from 

the Monthly Review mAgazine, with their 
permission. It it from the February, 1974 
issue. The MR hal .tudent subscription 
rates of $7 per year, And correspondence 
should be addressed to 62 West 14 Street, 
New York, N.Y. Thil il the second half of 
the article begun in Friday's iSlue of the 
Triton Times. 

Most fundamental here is the fa ct , too 
often forgotten by social scientists eac h 
working in his or he r narrow spec ialty, 
that captialism is a global system and not 
a co llec tion of separate nat ional 
economies. What happens in any part of 
the system affects to some extent what 
happens in all the others; and if the part 
in que stion happens to be by far the 
largest in the system, as is the case with 
the United States in world capitalism, the 
effect on some or all of the other parts is 
likely to be large and even decisille . The 
question, then, is to what extent the 
performance of the world cap~alist 
economy, and especially the economies 
of Germany and Japan , has been 
determined by the relative prosperity of 
the United States during this period . 

It is, I believe, beyond dispute that 
both the German and the Japanese 
economic "miracles" were launched in 
the boom which accompanied the 
Korean War, i.e ., as a direct result of U .S. 
mi li tary spending and involvement. In 
the case of Germany, He inz Abosch has 
written' "For the West German econom y, 
the Korea n War proved to be a 
remarkable st imulant : while the big 
Industr ial powers had to step up the 
production of armaments , Germany, still 
subject to the restrictions of the Potsdam 
Agreement , wa s able to in crease he r 
entire Indu stria l output, thanks to th e 
orders that poured in from all sides . As 
Profes or (Henry) Wall ich remarks' ' It 
was sparks from the Korean War that set 
Germ an export a light.' " Wha t was true 
for Germany was even mo re so for Japan 
which was the rear stagi ng area for U.S 
forces fighting in Korea a nd a direct 
reciplPnt of large military orde r " In 
terms of the growth situation," writes 
Profes or Tsuru , "the korean confl ict an d 
th£' s ub~equent rnal ntenance of 'spec la l 
procurrme nt' demand was a d i ~tin c t 
boon" 

01 course It would not be pOSSible to 
rqablish so dose a continuing depen-
dencp of the German and japane e 
('conomles on U.S military spendi ng . 
ThE' booms touched off by Korea had 
much else to fE'ed on : repa ir of war 
damage, renovation of cap ital eq ul p-
nl(>nt . and , perhaps most important, a 
verllable binge of "auto m o bihzatlon " 
sim ilar to that which had susta ined th e 
U S pconomy in the 1920s . But con-
tinuing strong demand for Germa n and 
japanese exports remai ned a sine q ua 
non of the pro perity of these coun trle , 
and It IS diffic ult to believe that th is 
Pxport demand would have held up if the 
US eco nomy had once again sunk into a 
condition of low-leve l stagnation such as 
prevailed in the 1930s. It is we ll to 
remember th at in that earlier period it 
was on ly mil itary spe nding , fi rst in japan 
and German y and o oly lat r in the 
Uni ted StatE'S, which pulled the capita l ist 
wo rld out of the Great Depress ion . In the 
postwar p riod I would arg ue that it has 
bE'en mi lita ry spe nding (plus oth e r 
Simi larly motivated ou tlays such as 
economic subs idi es to puppe t and client 
states), so far large ly but by no mean s 

triton times 
Editor in Chief Sports Editor 

exc lusively centered in the Uni ted S ates 
which has prevented the capi ta li st wo rld 
from sinking into a new Great 
De pression . As an hi s tori c al in -
te rpretation of thse strife-ridden dcades, 
I submit that this makes vastly more 
sense than the notion that the postwar 
performance of world capital ism has 
been the brain child of economists a ided 
and a betted by wise pol it ical leaders. 
Econom ists m ay like to think that they 
are powerful, and pol iti cal leade rs that 
the y are wise . Bu t the sad truth is that 
the re is precious little evidence to 
support these am iable conceits. True, 
the y playa rol e, but not the o ne they 
think they play or would like to play; 
rather their role is that of instrume nts 
and agents of elemental forces generated 
by a blind and self-contrad ic tory 
economic system whi ch no one can 
control. 

The real question to which economists 
ought to address themselves , but con-
sistently refuse to do so, is why 
capitalism in the twentieth century has 
suc h a powerful tendency to stagnation 
that it requires increasingly mass ive 
forms of public and private waste to keep 
itself going at all . (As every reasonably 
sensitive obse rll e r of contemporary 
capitalism knows, mili tary spending is 
only the leaqing species of a large 
genu s.) Basica lly, the reason was stated 
by Marx with both eloquence and clarity 
more than a hundred years ago when he 
wrote: "The real barrier of capitali st 
production is capi tal itself . It is the fact 
that capita l and its se lf-expansion appear 
as the starting and c lo Ing POint , as the 
mo t ive and a im of product ion, that 
produ ction is mere ly production for 
capi tal , and not vice v rsa , the means of 
production me re means for an ever-
xpandi ng system of the life process for 

the bene fit of the society of producers ." 
To p ut the point In another way, as long 
as the dr iVing forces of production are 
profi t and the expansion of profit-making 
ent rprises, and as long as th Incomes of 
working people are held down preCisely 
to m ake possible an Increa e in profits 
and a more rapid expansion of en-
terprises, so long will the growth of 
society's power to produce tend to 
outstriP ItS power to comume And If thiS 
co ntradiction is deeper and more per-
vasiv today than It was In Marx's time, 
the reason i\ that In the Intervening 
pNiod the process of concentration and 
centralization of capital-which he 
recognized as Inpvitable fpatures of 
cap ita list development-has gone so far 
that domll1ant monopolies today have 
the po wer not only to explOi t their own 
worke rs but all other strata of oClety as 
well , thus expandlnl; the gap betwpen 
wealth at one pole and poverty at the 
oth er, at the very time when there is , or 
soon could be , ample productive power 
to prov ide everyone wi thou t exceptio n 
wi th the m ans to a decent hu man 
live lihood . 

Under these circ umstances economists 
have taken upo n themselves the ta sk of 
hidi ng the facts, of making the un-
contro ll able appear unde r co ntro l, of 
rational izin g a system wh ich condemns 
hundreds of millio ns of peopl e to lives of 
despair and sta rvation , and wh ich 
through its unrestrained proll igacy and 
violence thre ate ns the very cont inuation 
of life on earth . It is not a task I envy 
them .

denied absolutely any possibility 
for a near future Beatles reunion 
tour or album . In a news story 
printed in the May 11 Record World 
(S/ S/ R. Inc.). claims. "As far as 
McCartney is, concerned. the 
Beatles will not be performing 
together at any time, nor have any 
offers by promoters for any type of 
performance been di scussed . 
McCartney points out that being 
seen with other Beatie is merely 
soc ial since they are still friendly 
and any professional co llaborat ion 
might be assist ing each other on 
recording tracks." Might be?

Tritons Playoff Bid Spoiled 

Pt. Lorna Rally Gains Split 
One fan put it succinctly 

when she said "it was 
depressing ." For 'the 
members of Lyle Olsen 's 
baseball squad it was very 
disheartening as the Tritons 
dropped out of a possible 
playoff berth when Point 
Loma College rallied in the 
ninth inning to beat UCSD 
in the second game of a 
double header. 

A week ago the Tritons 
were all alone in second 
place of the Southern 
Division, NAIA District III. 
Last Tuesday they lost to 
Cal Baptist. 3-1, to drop into 
a second place tie with 
Point loma. Due to a loss in 
the previous meeting of the 
two clubs the Tritons had to 
win both games of 
Saturday's double header in 
order to Advance to the last 
playoff berth . 

FrldlY 
IRVINE 

The Tritons took the first 
game. 2- 1. behind the 
pitching of Randy Miller 
and the hitting of Cary 
Patton and Jim McWeeney. 
In the second game Point 
loma overcame a two run 
deficit in the ninth to 
escape with a 3-2 victory 
and the playoff spot. 

Miller was sharp in his 
win over Point loma. He 
limited the Point Loma 
hitters to 5 hits and struck 
out & while walking no one . 
Using a good fastball and a 
knuckler, Miller stymied the 
opposition time and time 
again . 

Gary Patton drove in the 
winning run in the bottom 
of the sixth with a long 
triple to center. scoring Curt 
Jenkins who had singled 

ueSD POINT LOMA 

with one out. 

Jim McWeeney provided 
the first run with a two out 

. home run in the second 
inning. McWeeney's shot, a 
line drive which carried 
over the 340 foot mark 
down the left field line. was 
the first home run hit out of 
the home park by a UCSD 
player this year . 

In the second game the 
Tritons jumped off to a 
quick 2-0 lead in the second 
inning . With one out 
McWeeney doubled then 
scored on Pete Yocky's 
triple into the left field 
corner . Vince Allen then 
brought Yocky home with a 
sacrifice fly to left. 

Point Loma came back in 
the ninth inning to score all 
three of their runs. Pitcher 
Jeff .Wiederholt began the 
ir;lning by striking out the 
first batter. but then gave 
up a si ngle to the second 
hitter . He got the next man 
to ground into a force play. 
leaving a man at f irst with 
two outs. The next hitter 
singled to place men at first 
and second . A rock in th e 
outfi e ld th en turn ed a 
single into a t riple as the 
ba ll h it the rock and 
bounded high over the 
ce n terflelder lenkin 's 
outstretched glove and 
rolled to the fence The 

Rrst Game 

ensuing batter th n 
managed a scratch si ngle to 
the Infield to drive in the 
winnine run 

In all probability UCSD 
would have won 2-1 had the 
ball not taken the funny 
bounce that it did . It was a 
very tough game to lose for 
the whol e team. but 
especially for Jeff 
Wiederholt . 

Wiederholt pitched an 
excellent ball game, going 
all nine innings. He did not 
allow a hit until the sixth 
inning and forced a lot of 
ground balls that were 
turned into easy outs. On 
the other hand if the Tritons 
had supplied Jeff with any 
hitting Jeff would have had 
himself a win and the team 
would have had itself a 
berth in the playoffs. 

For UCSD it was a game 
of blown opportun it ies. 

In the second inn ing 
when they did score thei r 
two runs. another potent ia l 
run was cutoff when Danny 
Kilpatr ick was picked off 
first base after op ning the 
inn ing WIth a single. 

I n the eighth the POint 
Loma leftfielder robbed 
Curt lenklnS of a two run 
double wh n he made a 
fl ne one-handpd ca t ch . 
running away from the 
plate

SPORTS 

After Jenkins was robbed 
of the hit he returned to the 
dugout and said I wanted 
my last at-bat here (at 
UCSD) to be one I could 
remember, not a lousy fly 
ball to left field ." Except for 
the outstanding catch it 
would have been a hit that 
the whole team would have 
remembered for a long 
time. 

In a non-league game last 
Friday the Tritons hosted 
UC Irvine. Irvine won the 
game, 5-1. but not after a 
struggle with the scrappy 
Tr it o n squad . UCSD 
managed to outhit UCI 10-8 
and :eft 15 men on base. 
but ,ould only manage a 
single run against t he 
Anteaters 

for 5 and Bill gett ing a pair 
of hits in three off icial at-
bat s. Unfortunat ely the 
Triton s never put together a 
big inn ing. managing o nly a 
ninth inn ing run 

The win for UCI was their 
25th in a row and gave them 
a record of 40-7 on the 
season. They are expected 
to defend theI r NCAA mall

He was also slJrprised at 
the casualness of UCSD 
student attire. "In the Navy 
of course, we'believed that 
people who are neat and 
clean have a better morale. 
A perso'n's feeling about 
himself conforms to his 
general appearance." 

Zana Waughtel has been 
a student, the wife of a 
student, and the mother of 
a student. Now, it's her turn 
again . "There are so many 
interesting things to learn, I 
need another 200 years to 
do them aiL" 

Presently carrying 20 
units, she will graduate in 
june with a degree in Visual 
Arts. "You have to keep 
going," she said . "Life is so 
exciting." Zana uses pastels 
and acrylics as artistic 
media. She also sculpts . " I 
can 't use oils in the house, 
it makes the butter taste 
like linseed oiL" 

She and her husband also 
skin dive a lot, and Zana 
plans to finish her flYing 
lessons for her PJlot 's 
license this summer. Her 
area of study is pre-
Columbian art. Mexico is a 
real love. "Mexicans have a 
great sense of belonging, 
and knowing they belong." 
She said she was glad of the 
opportunity to attend 
UCSD. and benefit '· trom 
some of my tax money It's 
an excellent university. But 
I'm tired of the un-
dergraduate life ." She 
Wishes there were some 
flowers planted at Muir, to 
brighten the dull ap-
pearance of "San Quentin 
South ." 

One young man, a 28 
year-old·veteran. who asked 
to remain unidentified, sa id 
he liked the competition 
here He entered Revelle as 
a junior, haVing attended in 
San Diego City College for 
two weeks . He IS married, 
works 20 hours a week, and 
carries 12 units . "There are 
certain disadvantages about 
professors here. Because

I'm older, I'm looked down 
on . I'm a maverick . 
Although I'm supposedly in 
my peak productive years 
I'm not given a chance:: 
The fierce competition is a 
mixed blessing. "I have to 
work hard and so I have no 
time to get 'spiritually 
down'. But I can cope with 
discomfort. What about the 
18 or 19-year-old who 
can'!?" 

lynn Smith has attended 
three colleges before 
coming to UCSD and is 
majoring in anthropology. 
This was not her first 
~hoice. She -wanted to be a 
pre-med student, but gave 
up that dream when she 
found out that the cut off 
age for medical school is 
25, "unless your are ex-
ceptionally exceptional". 
Lynn is 30. She is carrying 
24 units this quarter so she 
can graduate in june. She 
also works part time as a 
technical illustrator, a ~ob 
she landed after a whiz two 
hour instruction session on 
how to use a pen . Part of 
her income in previous jobs 
went to support her family -
one set of grandparents. an 
unusual burden . " It's a 
different culture," she said. 
Her ancestors are Fijian . 
"College seems like a waste. 
in a way. Leaving high 
sch'oo l, you go to co llege 
four years or get four years 
of job experience. Either 
way you end up in the same 
place in the job market 
Except that in co llege you 
have less money. A lot 
less " 

David Rollins works two 
nights a week as a flight 
instructor at Miramar Naval 
Air Station, while studYing 
history He has a time limit 
of two years tt> fi nish the 
course, so hopes to pick up 
a total of 100 units by 
December 1975. "There are 
certainly no gimmick 
courses here," he says 
"When I study a course, I 
like to pursue an area which 
Interests me But I can't do 
that here. j have to keep 
studying just what the 
course demands." David, 
age 43, has a wife, two sons 
and a daughter He decided 
on history as a major 
because he is generally 
intere ted in the past , 
particularly in ancient 
America .

brought retired lieutenant 
Commander Pat David to 
UCSD to study an-
thropology . During her 
career as an 
anesthesiologist in the 
Navy, she traveled in places 
such as Newfoundland and 
the Far East. These travels 
stimulated her interest. 
"There is a lot to be said for 
being aware of the values of 
other cultures and races. 
particu larly amongst our 
own culture." 

"I came to UCSD and 
immediately was 
Fascist! ... But I find now, I'm 
more introspective. and 
have grown a lot these past 
five years." Kenneth Mc-
Master , age 37, a 
psychology major at Muir, 
·sa,!,s, "at work, I was 
con'sidered liberal, a little to 
the left ." 

Switzerland, and the 
Sorbonne. At UCSD, he 
transferred to Third College 
from Revelle "because of a 
certain immaturity . We 
were not being treated as 
adults but as children . What 
was important to them was 
trivia to me." He graduates 
in june in Urban and Rural 
Studies . "Third College is an 
'oh.' college. It's equated 
with third class . But there is 
a great deal of maturity 
there." Rolando works part 
time with a company which 
produces educational films . 
He will return to Panama in 
the summer.

ticipation by UCSD af-
filiated residents of Ocean 
Beach, Mission Beach 
Pacific Beach , and 
Clairemoot the South 
Streaker was discontinued 
as of May 5. 

He had served four years 
in the Navy and worked 
several years before he 
decided to return to 
college. "I made a list of 
goals and subgoals . I cut 
out careers which I didn't 
like or were unfeasible, like 
archeology or nuclear 
physics . Then I considered I 
had a family to support, so I 
needed some choice which 
was economical ly logical. 
Psychology seems to me to 
be a field which would 
expand in the future " 
Kenneth IS presently taking 
12 units and working eight 
hours a day. from 3 to 11 .30 
p m The Company he works 
for has been very un-
derstanding of hiS student 
life. 

The South Streaker , 
modeled after the suc-
cess ful Coast Cruiser 
bussing scheme, began 
ervice April 1 and had 

been averaging a mere 20 
riders a morning . The cost 
of running this service has 
been $200 per day with 
actual intake of $60 per 
day. This $140 a day 10 s 
has been absorbed 
through funds provided 
the bus ervice by UCSD 
par~ing fines .
