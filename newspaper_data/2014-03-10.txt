A.S. Council Votes to Pull 
Funds from State Prisons 

A.S. Council passed a resolution to divest from the Prison Industrial Complex System with a 21–1–1 vote on March 5. The bill 
claims that the PIC targets low-level drug dealers 
from poor ethnic communities and exploits them 
by placing them in the prison system for several 
years or decades for their unfree labor, keeping pris-
oners in solitary confinement for years at a time.

Divestment is a legislative tactic to disengage 
unethical or morally ambiguous stocks, bonds 
or investment funds. The Students Against Mass 

Incarceration bill was brought to Council with 
four major goals: UC divestment the from the PIC, 
nationwide divestment from the PIC, investment in 
communities rather than the prison industry and 
prison abolition.

Alborz Ghandehari, a graduate student in the 
ethnic studies department and a SAMI organizer, 
believes that the U.S. is responsible for the inhu-
mane treatment of the PIC.

“In the past 40 years, there has been a 1,200 
percent increase in the UC prison population

GREEK  LIFE

Resolution Banning “Colony” Passes
Concerns about the use of the word among the Greek community sparks debate.

A.S. Council passed a resolution to 
ban the usage of the term “colony” in 
the UCSD community on Wednesday, 
March 5.

The Greek life community and 
the Student Affirmative Action 
Committee proposed the resolution in 

a joint effort after individuals unaffili-
ated with the Greek system brought the 
usage of the term “colony” to the atten-
tion of the Office for the prevention of 
Harassment and Discrimination. 

Reports were filed against the use 
of the term “colonization” by UCSD’s 
newest sorority Alpha Omicron Pi. 
Originally, AOII titled the celebration 
that they had on Jan. 28 to commemo-
rate the establishment of its charter as 

the “Colonization Ceremony.” 
After receiving notice of the reports 

two hours before the start of their 
event, the AOII and the Panhellenic 
Society took immediate action to 
replace “colonization” with “establish-
ment.”

Council Tom Forter clarifies what the

The non-binding resolution to divest from the Prison Industrial Complex System 
passed Council 21-1-1 March 5 although concerns with the bill’s language linger. 

UC Irvine 
Votes to 
End UCSA 
Membership

UC   SYSTEM

UC Irvine’s Associated Students 
Legislative Council formally voted 
to withdraw from the University of 
California Student Association on 
Feb. 27. The UCSA is a coalition of 
student governments, with represen-
tatives from all UC campuses except 
UC Davis, whose goal is to fight for 
a variety of issues affecting students 
through grassroots organization and 
direct advocacy. 

ASUCI’s longstanding grievanc-
es with the UCSA culminated in 
its legislative bill B49-14, entitled 
“Withdrawal of ASUCI from the 
University of California Student 
Association.” It was drafted by 
Executive Vice President Melissa 
Gamble and School of Information 
and Computer Science representa-
tive Patrick Shen.

One major concern raised by 
B49-14 was UCSA’s perceived inac-
tion towards the appointment of 
Janet Napolitano as UC President. 
ASUCI had passed an earlier reso-
lution, R49-03, on Sept. 10, 2013 
which condemned Napolitano’s 
establishment and called for a Vote 
of No Confidence. However, other 
Board members eventually decided 
against taking action against her, a 
move that ASUCI considered “wor-
risome.” 

Furthermore, ASUCI sharp 
critiques include the Association 
executive director’s over-influence 
in student affairs, the UCSA’s lack 
of support towards the American 
Federation of State, County and 
Municipal Employees Local 3299, 
cultural incompetency and the gen-
eral structure of Board meeting.

“My office and I have come 
to realize that UC Irvine under-
graduates are being underserved by 
UCSA,” Gamble said in a letter to 
the campus. “There have been many 
issues with UCSA that have demon-
strated that UCSA does not hold UC 
Irvine’s values of respect, integrity, 
commitment and empathy.”

She also pointed out that 
the Irvine undergraduates pay 
$28,880.79 in membership fees 
to the Association every year, not 
including conference costs. Gamble 
invited students to discuss the bill in 
the week leading up to the final vote. 

According to a March 4 New 
University article, deliberation over 
the bill spanned three Legislative 
Council meetings. Those who 
opposed the bill showed hesita-
tion over losing voting power in 
the organization and suggested the 
decision be postponed until Council 
representatives could meet with the 
UCSA. Nevertheless, B49-14 was 
officially approved by an 8–2–2 
vote on Feb. 27. The Office of the 
Executive Vice President will have 
the power to decide if ASUCI will 
ever rejoin UCSA in the future.

“The resolution to ASUCI was 
presented before any discussion was 
initiated on the Board about these

term means to Greeks.
“While [the Greek community] 

understands the implications [that the 
term “colony”] can have, this has never 
been the intention of Greek life at a 
national level,” Forter said. “For Greek 
life, a ‘colony’ is a good thing, it shows 
that we are growing in a positive direc-
tion and need more chapters to allow 
for that growth.”

Similar ceremonies have taken 
place at UCSD before. In fact, Beta 
Theta Pi used the term in a ceremony 
held a few months before the usage of 
“colony” came under scrutiny.

To address the issue, president 
of the Panhellenic Soroity Council 
Carolyne Chen invited the UCSD 
community to an open forum-style 
meeting to discuss the historic sig-
nificance and implications of the term 
“colony” before AOII’s establishment 
ceremony took place.

The Greek community and SAAC 
continued their dialogue through 
the facilitation of A.S. Council. 

Vice President of Student Life in 
A.S. Council Linda Le has personal 

experience with the term “colony” 
as a first generation Vietnamese-
American. Following the coloniza-
tion of Vietnam by multiple coun-
tries, her parents, like thousands of 
other refugees, left Vietnam by boat 
to escape from the ramifications of 
the Vietnam War. 

“Colonization is something that 
should never be celebrated, especially 
in the context that nearly all instanc-
es of colonization has led to either 
genocide or cultural genocide and, in 
some instances, both,” Le said. “While 
‘colony’ in Greek life is not used in this 
context, I really commend the Greek 
Councils, especially the Panhellenic 
Council, in their willingness to create 
dialogue surrounding the meaning of 
the word.”

A.S. Council recently started a pro-
gram known as Tritons for Equity, 
Diversity and Inclusion to offer diver-
sity training to the student body on the 
cultural backgrounds and the implica-
tions conjured cultural differences.

Sixth College senator Allison 
Bagnol urges students and the Greek 
community alike to take advantage of 
TEDI and other similar workshops. 

The term “colony” reminds 
Bagnol, who identifies as a third 
generation Filipino-American, of 
the social and cultural struggles that 
Filipinos had to face under their long 
history of colonization. She believes 
that Filipinos today are still strug-
gling to define their true identity, an 
issue she grapples with as well. 

Bagnol, who has participated in 
several diversity training workshops 
already, is eager to hold one herself in 
the hopes of addressing any lingering 
questions regarding the impacts that 
a term such as “colony” can have. 

“Colonization is very triggering 
for me. I’ve spoken to people in the 
SAAC community, specifically in 
[Kaibigang Philipino] that also find 
this word very triggering,” Bagnol 
said. “In that regard, as far as colo-
nization being triggering, I want to 
voice their opinions as well because 
even though our individual stories 
may be different, colonization in gen-
eral has negative effects on this com-
munity.”

SCIENCE AND  
TECHNOLOGY

With the help of the NeuroBlate 
System by Monteris Medical, Inc., 
UCSD neurosurgeons have developed 
a less invasive, more accurate way of 
treating brain cancer using magnetic 
resonance imaging and lasers.

UC San Diego Health System’s Dr. 
Clark Chen, vice chairman of research 
and academic development and co-
director of neurosurgical oncology, 
recently used the new technique, called 
laser interstitial thermal therapy, in 
California’s first MRI-guided laser 
treatment.

“There are a few areas in the United 
States that offer this treatment,” Chen 
said. “We are the first in California 
to apply this technology to previous-
ly untreatable brain tumors. In this 
regard, we are ahead of UCSF; we’re 
ahead of UCLA and all the other UC 
[campuses].”

Laser ablation is not performed in a 
standard operating room, as it requires 
real-time MRI guidance to allow the 
neurosurgeons to accurately visualize 
the patient’s brain. Once the patient 
undergoes general anesthesia, neuro-
surgeons make a dime-sized incision 
over the pertinent area of the skull 
and insert a tiny laser probe with a 
miniscule width that limits damage to 
surrounding tissues. At the tumor site, 
neurosurgeons fire the laser at a very 

specific heat to kill the cancer, leaving 
the rest of the brain untouched.

In the case of one patient, whose 
thalamic tumor was considered too 
deep in her brain to risk open sur-
gery, the new treatment was life-
saving.

“The patient … was initially told by 
another hospital that she had an incur-
able cancer,” Chen said. “With this 
technology, we were able to treat this 
cancer and help her fight this disease.”

According to a Feb. 24 UCSD 
news release, Chen is optimistic about 
expanded applications for the new 
technology. Chen said the laser tech-
nique can be used to treat several types 
of brain tumors, “including glioblas-
tomas, anaplastic astrocytomas and 
brain metastases.”

“I think it’s going to change how we 
practice brain surgery,” he said. Chen 
continued explaining that without this 
new development, surgery on portions 
of the brain that were too deep had 
often done more harm to the tissue 
than the tumor itself. Thus, patients’ 
only other option lay with radiation.

The new MRI-guided laser surgery, 
however, severely reduces the affected 
area and risk of collateral brain dam-
age, and Chen can uphold his promise 
to maintain and improve his patients’ 
life quality.

UCSD Neurosurgeons Develop Less 
Invasive Treatment for Brain Cancer

and high spending on prisons and 
much lower spending on education, 
healthcare and other social servic-
es,” Ghandehari said. “We need to 
be investing in communities, not in 
prisons. Unfortunately, communities 
affected by incarceration are subject 
to poorly funded education and a dire 
lack of social services.”

Manufacturing industries such 
textile, steel plants and auto indus-
tries laid off millions of workers in the 
1970s and moved operations overseas 
for cheaper labor. This left large seg-
ments of the population unemployed 
and impoverished, particularly black 
communities who worked in the 
industrial industry. During this time, 
former President Reagan proclaimed 
a “War on Drugs.”

SAMI members, including UCSD 
graduate student in the literature 
department Niall Twohig believed 
that Reagan used the War on Drugs 
to justify prison expansion and crimi-
nalize poor people of color.

“With this bill we’re remind-
ing the UC Regents that students 
have power,” Twohig said. “We’re 
letting them know that our taxes 
and tuition will not go to compa-
nies whose existence is premised on 
criminalizing and entombing black, 
brown and poor white communities.”

When asked about the next steps 
expected from this divestment, SAMI 
Organizer and AVP Local Affairs 
Allyson Osorio said that she hopes 

that the passing of this divestment 
resolution will encourage other UC 
campuses to divest as well. So far, 
UC Berkeley, UCLA and UC Santa 
Barbara have divested along with 
UCSD. 

“We have been working with the 
other UCs in order to get their A.S. 
councils to pass divestment,” Osorio 
said. “We have to get all the UCs on 
board in order to get the regents to 
divest. Students must all mobilize 
together across California to get the 
other UCs to get the bill to pass. 
Personally, God willing, I do believe 
a year from now all the UCs will be 
on board with divesting from the UC 
system.”

During the meeting, Revelle 
Senator Marco Vasquez opposed 
the bill because he disagreed with 
the wording and therefore could not 
stand behind the bill.

“I understand that this is the start-
ing point but I don’t think the solu-
tion or the way to start is by stating 
that the entire system was created 
to actively oppress people,” Vasquez 
said. “I think that we’re missing some 
facts about the crimes that are com-
mitted in these communities. The 
focus should be on poverty, and I 
would say we need to invest into hav-
ing jobs available, in having families 
[and] to invest in resources and in 
education.”

Although Transfer Senator Ricky 
Martorana voted yes on the resolu-
tion, he agreed with Vasquez that the 
wording was too strong, claiming that 

legislators would not take the lan-
guage seriously if they felt accused.

In an interview with the Guardian, 
Osorio responded that Vasquez’s con-
cerns were not the central point of the 
resolution.

“Many may think this is only sym-
bolic work, but we’re still going to 
work behind the policy and every-
thing in order to get our end goal to 
be a reality,” Osorio said. “Everyone 
is affected by it, and it’s not to attack 
a certain group or a political party, 
but just to bring light to a lot of the 
injustices a lot of people face. We will 
be in this for the long run.”

Physical Sciences Senator Sierra 
Donaldson believed that declaring a 
war on drugs is declaring a war on 
drug users.

“It dehumanizes them to the point 
where you must take drastic mea-
sures against them,” Donaldson said. 
“When you look at the statistics that 
white folks and black folks use the 
same amount of drugs, yet black folks 
get imprisoned so much more, that is 
not just an anomaly.”

The discussion ended with 
President Andy Buselt encouraging 
everyone to support the bill.

“In the past I have been able to 
hear how the PIC has impacted other 
people’s lives and families and I take 
that into account with my vote,” 
Buselt said. “The criminal justice sys-
tem is blatantly racist.”

Senators Express Concerns with Resolution’s Strong Language

issues,” ASUCSD External Affairs 
Vice President and UCSA Board 
member Vanessa Garcia said. “Since 
UCSA is a coalition of student gov-
ernments, every association is cru-
cial to maintaining our credibility 

and student power.”
UCSA officers later wrote a let-

ter to the ASUCI Executive Cabinet 
apologizing for the dissatisfaction 
and addressed the concerns laid out 
by Gamble. It urged UC Irvine to 
reconsider its decision and to fur-
ther deliberate the problems at the 

March Board meeting. 
“With the proper time and con-

sideration, it is UCSA’s hope that 
ASUCI remain a part of UCSA to 
enact the solutions necessary for 
ASUCI to feel its membership to 
UCSA valuable,” the letter said. 
“UCSA is only as effective as all of its 

members, and ASUCI is incredibly 
essential to UCSA and the greater 
student movement. 

Garcia also expressed hope that 
the Board would be able to work out 
a successful resolution.

“Current Board Members have 
already been working to restructure 

UCSA for a few months now,” Garcia 
said. “I have heard some of the pro-
posals, and I believe changes to the 
Association can address the issues 
brought forward by ASUCI.”

Garcia Hopes ASUCI’s Departure from UCSA Will Lead to Improvements and Restructuring for All

Revolutionary changes in gun technology will now enable average Americans to feel 
like James Bond. Just like Bond’s 
special weapon in Skyfall, newly 
marketed “smart guns” are personal-
ized to operate for only one shooter. 
Though current technology has 
yet to produce an exact replica of 
Bond’s firearm — one that would 
activate through fingerprint recog-
nition — the release of the world’s 
first personalized handgun, the iP1, 
has experts claiming that we are on 
the right track. 

Recently introduced to the 
U.S. market by the German firm 
Armatix, the iP1 comes with a radio 

frequency identification wristwatch 
that the shooter must be wearing in 
order to fire the weapon. Soon, for a 
whopping $1,798, Americans will be 
able to purchase this gun-watch duo 
meant to prevent both accidental 
and intentional gun-related deaths 
and injuries, while simultaneously 
ensuring the weapon does not fall 
into the wrong hands.

However, the actual reliability 
of this “007” technology has yet to 
be tested on the streets and in the 
homes of America, so the true 
impact — along with possible unin-
tended consequences — of the smart 
gun remains a gray area at best. 
Still, many proponents of this new 
technology argue that it be legally 
required on the basis of its life-saving 

potential. In fact, in 2002, New Jersey 
passed a law stating that three years 
after its introduction to the American 
market, the smart gun would become 
the only gun sold within the state. 
However, while the potential benefits 
of this technology are great, it would 
be wiser for the government to start 
implementation efforts by simply 
encouraging smart gun use through 
media or public education, rather 
than enforcing this new technology 
right from the get go. 

One potential problem is that 
making “smart” features on guns 
mandatory too quickly might 
spawn public resentment and 
hinder their eventual acceptance. 
In fact, gun rights advocates are 
already taking up arms against 

the marketing of the iP1 at the 
California Oak Tree Gun Club. 
Many former customers accused 
the store of encouraging the viola-
tion of Second Amendment rights 
by promoting this new technology. 
Further, with the smart gun being 
far more expensive than a regular 
handgun at this point, requiring 
people to buy it is likely to foster 
indignation and could poten-
tially counter the goal of smart gun 
advocates. 

Those who argue in favor of gov-
ernment enforcement of the smart 
gun lean heavily on two main ideas. 
First, because the smart gun allows 
only those registered to the gun to 

Ostensibly, GoldieBlox has the admirable mis-
sion of nudging more females towards engineering 
and related fields in which they’re typically under-
represented. But upon further examination, the 
new line of girl-focused toys is simply perpetuating 
sexist stereotypes. It keeps young girls in the same 
confined mold as before, playing with pastel colored, 
princess-themed toys. 

The company’s website reveals its purpose: 
to design a construction-based toy that caters to 
females and to disrupt the “pink aisle” stereotype of 
toy store sections aimed towards girls. While this is 
a fantastic goal, one has to wonder how much they 
can really disrupt the status quo with more pink 
toys, full of frilly ribbons and stories set in castles. 

Just like when Lego released a line of simplistic 
construction toys and pretty magazines called Lego 
Friends, aimed specifically at girls, GoldieBlox will 
teach young females that if they want to enjoy simi-
lar building and construction toys to those of their 
male counterparts, they should do it with watered-
down, pink versions. 

Instead, entrepreneurs like Debbie Sterling, 
the founder of GoldieBlox, should market gender-
neutral toys and promote a more equitable way 
of teaching young kids to enjoy engineering. 
Marketing complex Legos to boys or GoldieBlox 
to girls might be good for sales, but in the end, it 
will only deepen the crisis. There will always be 
the underlying problem that, because the sexes 
grew up with different toys, one learned to do 
things differently or better than the other. The dis-
parity in the number of female versus male engi-
neers needs to be fixed, but creating yet another 
gender-specific toy is not the answer.

Overly Simplistic Construction Sets 
Gloss Over Engineering Concepts

Gender Specific Toys Introduce Young 
Girls to Male-Dominated Fields

Toys Marketed to Girls Exacerbate 
Gender Gap in Science & Engineering 

Toys might be marketed as gender specific, but 
that doesn’t mean that they are necessarily gender 
exclusive. GoldieBlox has introduced a construc-
tion toy that will be more aesthetically pleasing for 
girls, while combining basic principles of building 
and cognition. These toys are an innovative way to 
encourage girls to become interested in engineer-
ing and sciences in hopes of reaching much needed 
gender parity in these professional fields.

Just as the colors blue and pink denote masculin-
ity and femininity respectively, toys can be marketed 
in similar ways. Gender specificity is necessary 
here because GoldieBlox can appeal to consumers 
who subconsciously purchase pink toys for their 
daughters, while introducing traditionally male-
dominated subjects like engineering and science. 
This is a natural way for adults to expose these fields 
to young girls. 

According to Dr. Beth Holloway, Purdue 
University’s director of Women in Engineering 
Program, young girls need to be drawn by what 
interests them to later feel the “sense of accomplish-
ment that comes from designing something.” In 
turn, this exposure will help them consider careers 
in the science, technology, engineering and math 
fields. As President Greg McVey of construction toy 
firm Infinitoy mentions: GoldieBlox provides this 
experience, allowing girls to enhance their motor 
skills while expressing their creativity.

Of course, a single toy is not going to create an 
engineer right away and GoldieBlox’s true impact is 
still to be realized. However, with the influence of 
family and education, it can contribute to shaping a 
girl’s interest and foster an open approach to these 
historically male-dominated fields.

Goldieblox claims that its toy sets teach young 
girls about engineering concepts, but the actual 
mechanics behind its products lack the complex-
ity necessary to thoroughly explain engineering 
principles. Goldieblox comes in extremely basic 
sets, with its only specific attraction to girls being 
the pink colors and an accompanying storyline. 
However, compared to its more creative com-
petitors in the toy aisle, gender-specific toys are 
dumbed down to the point where they actually fail 
in their teaching goals.

On the company’s website, each Goldieblox set 
is associated with a “skill concept” to be taught. 
Concepts such as a wheel and axle or belt drive 
are introduced to girls aged 4 to 9. But therein 
lays the problem: It is only a cursory introduction. 
The sets are so simple that they hinder compre-
hensive discovery and knowledge of what a belt 
drive is actually capable of. Currently, the “spin-
ning machine” has girls wrapping a ribbon around 
spools to rotate multiple objects with one source 
of energy. But belt drives can vary in torque and 
speed and involve much more significant ideas 
than just power transfer. These basic toy parts 
prevent the girls from tinkering with these param-
eters — key skills that allow comfort and confi-
dence in engineering. Kids need to see that these 
effects exist so that they can develop an intuitive 
logic in designing. 

While Goldieblox fills a niche for young girls 
looking to have inspirational building toys, the 
simplicity of each set takes away from the depth 
of the learning experience. In the end, their cre-
ativity is limited compared to the building sets 
marketed to boys.

Smart Firearms Are Not the Immediate Gun Control Solution

Building Blocks A Farewell 
to All My 
Guardian 
Angels

I arrived on campus four years ago knowing I would work for the school newspaper. There 
was no other way around my 
youthful eagerness and tenacity for 
all things journalism. 

I picked up a copy of the UCSD 
Guardian, covered in atrocious, 
orange spot color, and saw a house 
ad that screamed “GET PAID TO 
WRITE” in a font that was most 
likely some derivative of Helvetica. 
“Get paid?” I thought. “I’d do that 
for free!” And it wasn’t long before 
the Guardian’s budget crisis really 
did mean we had to all work for 
free, but with the exception of a 
few, money-hungry randoms, none 
of us cared. The Guardian is so 
much more than a place to pick up 
a paycheck. 

I came into the job of editor-in-
chief knowing that I was sacrificing 
my time, my sanity and probably 
even my body (those sit ups 
and lunges we’d try to do during 
production never quite paid off). 
And now, with only one issue left 
I stand before a sea of free time I 
have not known since 2010, and 
that is the scariest thing of all. I’ll 
actually have time to exercise and 
go grocery shopping? I don’t have 
to eat Hi Thai twice a week? These 
are concepts that don’t quite seem 
plausible to me yet.

As stressful as running a twice-
weekly newspaper is, it gave me 
an immense sense of stability. No 
matter what happened that week, 
whatever harsh news we were 
reporting or shitty day I had, I 
knew I’d have somewhere to go 
every Wednesday and Sunday, 
and when I arrived, there would 
be a crowd of people as equally 
passionate for their distaste of the 
Oxford comma as I. No matter 
how dorky my interest in grammar 
was to others, at the Guardian, I 
was just one of many. And with 
AP style as just a starting point, I 
was able to bond with co-workers 
on ways not possible elsewhere on 
campus. With the shared interest to 
produce a quality body of work, we 
went to work for nearly 13 hours 
every week, twice a week. And no 
matter how dark the circles under 
my eyes were the next day, they got 
a little lighter when I got to pick up 
a fresh copy on stands on my way 
to a class. 

Although the Guardian has 
shown a lot of us our breaking 
points (ever so clearly, mine is 
rearranged furniture and too 
many “that’s what she said” jokes), 
it has given us the privilege of a 
lifetime to express ourselves in 
the time when we needed to most. 
It has given me sleepless nights 
from wondering whether I sent 
the right PDF to the printer and 
the best sleeps of my life via pure 
exhaustion, but I’m so thrilled 
to pass the torch onto so many 
capable, young journalists. Zev, 
although your middle school 
humor is often the most highlighted 
aspect of your personality, it never 
manages to outshine your talent, 
devotion and vast knowledge of 
all things UCSD. You started as 
“that tall Jewish boy” and you’re 
ending as our fearless leader. Don’t 
be afraid to take chances or gain 
a coffee dependency during your 
editorship. It’s for the best.

pull the trigger, many believe that 
the number of accidental child gun 
deaths and injuries would drastically 
decrease with smart gun enforcement. 
A second benefit attributed to firearm 
personalization technology is that it 
provides less incentive for gun thieves. 
Using stolen weapons for crime 
hinders the police in tracking down 
criminals, and the Bureau of Justice 
Statistics has posted numbers indicat-
ing an excess of 700 guns stolen every 
day in the United States. 

Though the above arguments for 
smart gun dissemination are certainly 
valid, they do not take into account 
the full picture when it comes to gun 
safety. According to a March 3 USA 

Today article, gun personalization 
might not make a significant impact 
when most homicides are actually car-
ried out by gun owners. In addition, 
the article goes on to explain that 
while many mass shootings are car-
ried out with shotguns or rifles, any 
smart gun technology mandates — 
at this point — would be restricted 
to handguns. This limitation also 
applies to accidental child shootings, 
as many of these involve long-bar-
reled guns. As for the argument that 
smart guns will deter robbers, this 
is more applicable to future smart 
guns; with the iP1, a thief would 
be able to use the gun as long as he 
stole the watch as well. 

Smart gun technology certainly 
appears to be a step in the right 

direction, but it is not the end-all 
solution to our firearm problems. 
It seems like the most logical 
thing to do at this point is to keep 
marketing this new weapon to the 
American public and see how it 
holds up. 

For now, there’s no need to 
muddy the water by making it 
mandatory. In launching his contest 
for smart gun technology, promi-
nent businessman Ron Conway 
stated, “We need the iPhone of 
guns.” If the smart gun hopes to 
achieve this status, it — like the 
iPhone — should let its success 
speak for itself.

V
C ontrary to its title, The Vagina Monologues is less of a monologue and more of a dialogue, intended to open up conversation about the culturally 
sensitive topic of women’s sexuality. Last week, starting 
Wednesday, March 5, a cast of 45 UCSD students took 
to the stage at Price Center Ballroom East to perform 
the series of monologues.

“The Vagina Monologues isn’t about the bra burn-
ing, ‘feminazi’ kind of feminism,” Earl Warren College 
senior Trish Vinnakota, one of the three directors of 
this year’s production, said. “It’s very to the point. Each 
monologue that is performed — in total 18 — talks 
about a different experience that … women have in 
everyday life. I think the most significant take away for 
people is that feminism doesn’t have to be this man-
hating kind of thing. Feminism is what you decide it 
to be.” 

The Vagina Monologues covers many topics typi-
cally regarded as personal or taboo, such as sex, birth, 
sexual assault, orgasms and pubic hair, to name a few. 
One monologue tells the story of a 65-year-old woman 
who’s never had an orgasm after an embarrasing 
experience with a man. Another talks about women 
trafficked in the 1990s as sex slaves in the Bosnian-
Croatian conflict. 

Though some monologues are centered on more 
graphic themes such as sexual violence, Vinnakota 
believes it’s important to recognize that overall, the 
monologues aim to encourage women to become 
more comfortable with their sexualities. She noted 
that The Vagina Monologues intends to show posi-
tive experiences between men and women, as well.

“All of the monologues are so incredibly different,” 

Vinnakota said. “There’s one monologue called ‘Bob,’ 
and it’s about a girl who has a great experience with a 
man — a girl who’s formerly ashamed of her vagina. 
But this man shows her that, ‘Hey, there’s nothing to 
be ashamed about.’ [...] It’s a very uplifting monologue, 
especially [since it’s] about a positive experience with 
a man.”

Playwright Eve Ensler created The Vagina 
Monologues in the 1990s after interviewing over 200 
women of different ages and backgrounds about their 
views and experiences with these intimate and uncon-
ventional topics. The monologues themselves are 
entirely based on the women’s responses during these 
interviews and the anecdotes each interviewee shared.

Produced nationally at college campuses and inter-
nationally in 77 countries, The Vagina Monologues has 
been performed at UCSD, where it has been received 
well by students, selling out for the past three years. 
The cast is larger here at UCSD than at most other 
campus productions, mainly because it’s much more 
inclusive, as the production tries not to turn away 
anyone who auditions, regardless of acting experience. 

Tickets for The Vagina Monologues were sold 
out by last Tuesday afternoon, the day before open-
ing night. The proceeds gathered from the ticket and 
merchandise sales were donated to the San Diego 
Center for Community Solutions, dedicated to assist-
ing women facing situations such as sexual assaults or 
different forms of abuse.

Members of The Vagina Monologues crew believe 
that because each member of the cast is given creative 
freedom to interpret and deliver their monologues as 
they choose, there is a constantly changing dynamic

E ven though it’s only been five years since UCSD’s chap-ter of Project RISHI — a student organization that aims to promote healthy lifestyles in rural India — was 
established, they’ve already made three trips to the village of 
Anandwan in Maharashtra. Members are currently planning 
their fourth trip where volunteers will assist in creating a chil-
dren’s sexual health education camp with seminars on bystander 
intervention, sexual assault prevention programs and a support 
system for victims and families. 

Since its inception in 2011 by UCSD alumnus Nikhil 
Nadkarni, Project RISHI, or Rural India Social and Health 
Improvement, students have engaged in hands-on projects like 
helping out at the leprosy clinics, shadowing physicians and 
teaching children’s dance seminars. 

Their first excursion to the village in 2009 was a survey trip 

to the site that would eventually become the target village site 
for the San Diego chapter and developed relationships with 
coordinators in the village.

During their last trip to India, students developed a general 
health education camp. They also donated $7,000 to the local 
Swaranandwan Disabled Orchestra to buy instruments and pay 
for travel outside the village to share its music; they’re now in 
the process of creating a media channel for the orchestra.

Sharma describes the village of Anandwan as a sanctuary 
for struggling and stigmatized communities, such as those 
of leprosy patients and those impoverished with disabilities. 
According to the website, Anandwan rehabilitation focuses on 
empowerment through self-efficiency by offering vocational

training, with the issues of sexual abuse 
and discrimination still rampant in 
rural India. 

“India’s climate is very politically 
and socially charged,” Sharma said. 
“There was the gang rape of 2012 
and [recently] this village girl get-
ting raped in her own village.” 

These refer to two horrific inci-
dents: The first is the fatal 2012 
Delhi gang rape, in which a 23-year-
old woman was beaten and gang 
raped on a private bus. The second 
case occurred earlier this year when 
a woman was gang raped by 13 
men of her own village, because the 
elders objected to her relationship 
with an outsider.

“There’s no real concept of sexual 
health and education [in India],” 
Sharma said. “People don’t neces-
sarily know they’re in that kind of 
dangerous situation.”

The first step in preventing such 
blatant abuse, according to Sharma, is 
exposing the problem.

Other ongoing RISHI proj-
ects include the development of 
an Intranet to create a network of 
shared information and resources 
that expands beyond Anandwan. The 
content must first be digitized and 
then translated before other villages 
can access the curriculum.

As of this quarter, UCSD Project 
RISHI is still in the early stages of plan-

ning its summer India trip.
“We’ve laid out the groundwork,” 

Sharma said. “We’re working on iden-
tifying the organizations that we’re 
going to work with in UCSD and 
the local community and in India to 
actually create the curriculum. [...] 
One of them is the Sexual Assault and 
Violence Prevention Resource Center 
on campus. We want to develop a 
sexual health and intervention train-
ing program [with them].”

Two weeks ago, the group held 
an introductory meeting with the 
Student Health Advocates on cam-
pus to work on outreach of sexual 
health. Sharma noted that she also 
hopes to use the connections she 
gained at the 2011 Clinton Global 
Initiative University conference, 
including an organization that’s 
an extension of Khan Academy, to 
build on this project.

However, while the Intranet is a 
major, long-term development, at 
the moment, the organization has 
other priorities.

“The sexual health education 
camp — that’s our main focus right 
now,” Sharma said. “We hope to 
empower the kids and Anandwan 
with the knowledge to promote 
healthy behaviors and also to engage 
these in kids in a social dialogue 
about sexual assault prevention.”

Project RISHI Members Are Planning a 
Sexual Health Education Camp in India

Students Celebrate Sexual Awareness Through Performing

to each year’s performance.
“Every year takes on its own per-

sona and personality,” Sixth College 
senior and Vagina Monologues per-
former Shayma Hesari said. “It’s real-
ly cool seeing how the same mono-
logues changed in their portrayals 
from last year to now.”

Hesari’s own performance 
involved a series of different fake 
orgasm noises, including the UCSD 
moan (“Oh yeah...I should be study-
ing!”). In preparing for her character 
and her lines, Hesari revealed that she 
used her own personality as a base 
and created a persona with a height-
ened sense of arrogance and sarcasm.

“When playing my character, I 
just became more confident in an 
arrogant way, and when I did the fake 
moans, I used humor to poke fun of 
the way people have sex,” Hesari said.

The crew for The Vagina 
Monologues is composed of three 
directors — Vinnakota, Victoria 
Hanna and Emilie Doan Van — 
a team of performers and a crew 
of marketing agents, known as the 
“Pussy Posse.” Workshop meetings 
were held every Sunday this win-
ter quarter to allow the actors to 
not only rehearse but also to learn 
about women’s health, oppression 

and sexual issues through various 
guest speakers.

“I think The Vagina Monologues 
is more than just a show,” Eleanor 
Roosevelt College senior and Vagina 
Monologues performer Maddison 
Eshoo said. “It’s an eye-opening 
experience.” 

In promoting The Vagina 
Monologues this year, the Pussy 
Posse created a short (and hilarious)
YouTube video in which they asked 
male students whimsical questions, 
such as their opinions on vaginas or 
where they would take a vagina on a 
date. When the video was featured 
in between Act I and Act II, the cre-
ators found the audience’s response 
very rewarding. 

“It made us happy when we heard 
students whispering about the parts 
of the video they had already seen 
because that meant the video reached 
out to some people before they came 
to see us,” Hesari said. 

Despite their success, the Pussy 
Posse crew experienced some dif-
ficulties in the marketing process. 
During their time tabling on Library 
Walk, the cast encountered students 
who had negative misconceptions 
about the play. Some stated that 
they didn’t want to hear women rant 
about being raped. Vinnekota relat-
ed one experience she had while 

promoting The Vagina Monologues 
on Library Walk.

“He said, word for word, ‘No way, 
that show is so awkward. Girls talk-
ing about rape? I don’t want to hear 
that,’” she said. “I don’t really think 
he thought about what he was saying 
or what it meant to a lot of victims of 
rape … but he was so ignorant. This 
encounter with this guy was probably 
one of the most extreme out of every-
one, and it’s disappointing.”

The members of the play assert-
ed that the play is neither a “femi-
nist display” nor a play that solely 
features rape or other sexual abuse.

“It’s understandable, but sad, that 
people feel this way because this 
play is really about opening your 
eyes to topics that are considered 
taboo and celebrating awareness,” 
Hesari said.

The audience also felt The Vagina 
Monologues was an unconventional 
but enlightening experience.

“It was a unique experience that 
brought to life a lot of unspoken 
issues in our society,” Roosevelt 
College senior Joanne Yuen said. “I 
think it made me more aware as an 
individual.” Additional reporting by 
Sydney Reck.

Ranked 11th in the nation, 
the UCSD women’s water polo 
team went 3–1 at the Claremont 
Convergence Invitational which 
took place last week. The Tritons 
beat Southern California opponents 
Occidental, Claremont-Mudd-
Scripps and Pomona-Pitzer during 
the two-day meet, held March 7 
to March 8, while falling in a close 
match to the University of Hawaii 9–6.

In their first game on Friday, 
the Tritons trounced Division III 
Occidental 16–1. Against the Tigers, 
junior attacker Jolene Guiliana and 

freshman center Lauren Boyer both 
posted hat-tricks, while sophomore 
attackers Julia Kirkland and Laura 
Kistler netted two goals apiece. The 
Tigers remained scoreless through 
three quarters but were able to beat 
UCSD’s second goalkeeper Alexsee 
Wilcox by netting their only score 
with four minutes to play.

Facing Claremont-Mudd-
Scripps, the Tritons were featured 
in another high-scoring bout, win-
ning 18–9. Guiliana had another 
big game, this time striking for a 
career-high five goals, while Lizotte 
and Boyer both picked up hat-tricks. 

On Saturday, UCSD faced the 

only other nationally ranked team 
at the meet, No. 13 University of 
Hawaii, who they had previously 
beat 10–9 in Irvine, on Feb. 22.

In its 9–6 win, University of 
Hawaii took an early 3–0 lead and 
closed out the first quarter with 
a 4–1 advantage. The Rainbow 
Wahine continued to lead 6–3 going 
into the last quarter and held on to 
their lead as both teams scored three 
goals apiece in the final frame.

Sophomore two-meter Alexis 
Wieseler led the Tritons on offense 
against the Rainbow Warriors, 
scoring four of UCSD’s six goals, 
while UCSD sophomore goalkeeper 

Courtney Miller picked up 13 saves.
The Tritons closed out the 

Invitational with a comfortable 11–6 
win over Pomona-Pitzer, in which 
Wieseler, Kirkland, senior utility 
Sarah Lizotte and sophomore center 
Lauren Finwall all scored two goals 
apiece.

UCSD will now look forward to 
the San Diego State Aztec Invite. 

The Tritons will face Princeton 
and Bucknell on March 15 and 
Harvard and Wagner College the 
following day.

LIBERTY AND FEAR: A HISTORY OF EUROPE, 1000-12000 – 
SOCIAL SCIENCES BUILDING, ROOM 107
Constantin Fasolt’s project develops a historically grounded diagnosis 
of our time. By bringing Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations to 
bear on what we already know about European history, he tries to 
show that circumstances coincided twice in the past millennium (ca. 
1000, ca. 1500) to launch Europe on a new phase in its historical 
development, leading to new extremes of liberty and fear. The 
diagnosis at which Fasolt arrives is that today we face the same 
conjunction of old truths with rapid social change that drove Europe to 
extremes of liberty and fear before. The question is whether we will 
respond in the same way or restrain our "craving for totality" (Stanley 
Cavell). Sponsored by IICAS, the European Studies Program and the 
Department of History at UC San Diego. More

THE MEXICAN AND U.S. ECONOMICS: 
TWENTY YEARS AFTER NAFTA AND SIX 
YEARS AFTER THE CRISIS – ELEANOR 
ROOSEVELT COLLEGE ADMIN. BLDG, ROOM 
115
NAFTA never lived up to its hype: it did not make 
Mexico converge to the United States in per capita 
income, nor did it solve Mexico’s employment 
problems or stem the flow of migration. NAFTA did 
foster greater regional integration, however, and 
helped transform Mexico into a major exporter of 
manufactured goods. The benefits for the rest of the 
Mexican economy were attenuated by heavy 
dependence of the export industries on imports of 
intermediate goods and weak “backward linkages.” 
In both the United States and Mexico, real wages 
have stagnated while productivity has continued to 
increase, and more highly skilled workers have 
captured most of the gains from increased trade. 
Some “reshoring” of industries to North America 
has occurred since the crisis of 2008, but so far the 
gains in employment have been disappointing in 
both nations. The United States, Mexico, and 
Canada all need to refocus on policies that could 
enable North America to become a more integrated 
and competitive region while encouraging a more 
equitable and sustainable pattern of growth. More

Finding 
Myself  in 
the Final 
Quarter

Aman I used to work with at the now-defunct, Escondido-based North 
County Times once said that you 
couldn’t be a sportswriter and 
be “in shape.” Keep in mind this 
was the same man I saw eat three 
McRibs over a five-hour shift, 
but give or take a few pounds, he 
was more or less right. Like most 
sportswriters, I began writing 
because I loved the game, but I 
wasn’t good enough to keep play-
ing. 

After redshirting on the soc-
cer team my freshman year, I took 
over as sports editor in the Fall 
Quarter 2012. Coincidentally, the 
Fall Quarter 2012 was when the 
Guardian — in an effort to cut into 
the paper’s debt — stopped paying 
its staff writers. 

Not so coincidentally, what was 
left of the staff I inherited jumped 
ship (all but my former Guardian 
Associate Sports Editor and two-
time NCAA national champion in 
the javein Nick Howe).

How, you may ask, can two peo-
ple cover UCSD’s 23 NCAA teams? 

Poorly, most of the time. 
Covering four or five games a week 
while holding down a second job 
and going to school full-time is no 
mean feat. 

And to this day, when I Google 
myself, an oddly aggressive twitter 
critique of an article I wrote almost 
two years ago to the day in which I 
was criticized for ignorance is still 
on the second page of results. To 
this day, I involuntarily shut my eyes 
and rub my temples when I think 
back on the time we misspelled 
“Tritons” in a headline.

But there were some small vic-
tories too.

I had the great pleasure of cover-
ing the UCSD softball and women’s 
soccer teams’ Final Four seasons, 
I was front-row when the women’s 
basketball team won 26 straight 
games and I won a California 
Collegiate Media Association award 
for a column that was not so surpris-
ingly criticized by UCSD’s Associate 
Athletics Director. 

But most importantly, after 
treading water for the good part of 
two years, I’ve finally assembled a 
staff of nine or so committed writers 
and will be passing on the torch to 
one Brandon Yu.

And to Brandon, I say, it’s a 
thankless job. Expect long nights 
in the office waiting for the 
NCAA Regional selections to be 
announced. Expect to misspell Johl 
Awerkamp at least once. Expect 
phone calls in the middle of the day 
criticizing your choice of volleyball 
photographs and long, drawn out 
passive-aggressive email correspon-
dence with the Athletics staff to get 
media access. 

But also expect to fall in love 
with this school, these athletes, the 
coaches and the storylines. 

It’s in this way that we’re not so 
unlike the athletes we editorialize. 

They lift and run and sweat, 
we spend 20 hours a week digging 
through archives of statistics, but 
both for that “one shining moment.” 

Whether it’s watching our goal-
keeper make a miraculous penalty 
kick save from the pitch or from the 
bleachers, in t he end, it has all been 
worth it.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 

UCSD blew a 21-point lead in the 
first-round game of the CCAA 
tournament to end its season.  

BY BRANDON YU
ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR

Returning to the annual California Collegiate Athletic Association tournament as last year’s champions, the UCSD women’s basketball team 
failed to reclaim the crown on Thursday, as fifth-seeded 
Cal State Los Angeles barely edged out the fourth-seeded 
Tritons 60–59 in the first round of postseason play. The 
loss ultimately served as the Tritons’ final game of the sea-
son, as they learned on Sunday evening that UCSD did not 
qualify for the NCAA’s selected field of teams competing 
for the national championship. 

On Thursday, UCSD kicked off its playoffs with a domi-
nant first half against Cal State Los Angeles. The early por-
tion of the first period was a contested affair, as the Tritons 
and Golden Eagles continuously traded baskets. However, 
UCSD pulled away, building a substantial lead that at one 
point reached 21 points over Los Angeles. At the end of the 
first half, the Tritons were up 41–23. 

“It was kind of like a tale of two halves,” UCSD head 
coach Heidi VanDerveer said. “In the first half, I thought 
we were aggressive offensively and very sharp defensively.” 

In the first half, the Tritons were stellar, making a 
whopping 60 percent (15–25) of their shots from the field. 
Perhaps more impressively, UCSD was also 64 percent 
(7–11) from the three-point territory. 

To provide perspective, the 41 points the Tritons record-
ed in the first half counted as the largest point total for any 
first half throughout their entire season. The second highest 
total was 40 points scored also against the Golden Eagles 
on Jan. 25. 

“Everything was going our way,” junior guard Miranda 
Seto said. “We were making everything [and] playing great 
defense. The most important thing was that we were play-
ing great defense. [We were] boxing out, getting rebounds, 
limiting them to one shot. It was just all going our way in the 
first half, and then in the second half it just went downhill.” 

The dominant performance UCSD put on in the first 
frame made the remaining 20 minutes only more unbear-
able as the Tritons played as a different team in what was a 
sluggish second period. 

Out of 25 shots put up from the field in the second half, 
the Tritons sunk only four. They finished with 16 percent 
shooting from the field, while allowing Cal State Los Angeles 
to make 50 percent (12–24) of its shots.

While the Tritons’ second half struggles were apparent in 
the shooting game, VanDerveer noted the defensive holes as 
a crucial factor in the loss. 

“We got very similar shots in the second half, but quite 
honestly I think we didn’t get stops defensively,” VanDerveer 
said. “Some of the shots we took created long rebounds, 
[and] they got out in transition. They got a little aggressive, 

and we were a little passive.” 
In spite of the struggling second 

half play, the Tritons still maintained 
the lead for much of the period. Not 
until the home stretch, when clutch 
play mattered the most, did UCSD fall 
short. In the final seven minutes, the 
Tritons failed to score a single point, 
while Cal State Los Angeles scored 12 
points to just barely punch its ticket to 
the semifinals. 

Ultimately, it was the charity stripe that 
brought about the Tritons’ demise. In their 
final two possessions, the Golden Eagles were 
sent to the free-throw line twice. With 44 seconds 
remaining, Los Angeles’s junior guard Tina Fantroy 
made one of her two free-throw shots to tie the game at 59. 
Then, with just under ten seconds left, senior guard Alisha 
Belt sank another free-throw to give the Golden Eagles their 
first advantage since the 12:31 mark of the first half. 

In the ensuing final possession of the game, Triton senior 
forward Erin Dautremont drove to the right side, putting up 
a failed layup and what may have been her final collegiate 
shot as the buzzer sounded. 

“On the last play, they pressed us full court,” Dautremont 
told the Guardian. “I got the ball at mid-court as time was 
winding down and had an opportunity to win the game but 
missed my layup. I was in disbelief and shock at the end of 
the game.” 

Seto and junior center Dana Webster led the Tritons 
in scoring with 14 points apiece. Seto also added seven 
rebounds and four assists in the losing effort. Dautremont 
finished with seven points and a game-high ten rebounds. 

“I think we had a very good season,” VanDerveer said. 
“Coming off last year’s conference tournament and NCAA 
run, we had some holes to fill [after] losing Daisy [Feder] 
and Emily [Osga]. I think Megan Perry had an excellent 
year. Miranda [Seto] obviously has established herself as one 
of the conference’s best guards.”

On a more positive note, UCSD garnered two All-CCAA 
accolades in Seto and Dautremont for their impressive play 
this season. Seto qualified for First Team All-CCAA, while 
Dautremont made Second Team.

UCSD concludes its season with a 16–11 overall record 
and will look to replace five graduating seniors, including 
Dautremont and starting guard Stephanie Yano, for the next 
season.
