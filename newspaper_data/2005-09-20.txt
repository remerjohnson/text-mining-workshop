Officials optimistic 
about co,op negotiations 
Progress made on several issues in 
year-long talk, ombudswoman says 

By ERIKA CERVANTES 
Contributing Writer 

While year-long discussions 
between As ociated SUldents, the 
Gracluatc Student Association 
and University Centers concern-
ing the leases of four campus co-
ops remain unresolved, univer-
sity admi nistrators are optimistic 
aoout current negotiations. 

"'ignificantprogress has been 
made and the negotiating teams 
have reached tentative agree-
ment on many issues," Campus 
Ombudswoman Med iator Judith 
Bruner stated in an officia l state-
ment approved by negotiating 
parties. " Pendi ng resolution on 
a few remaining items, all nego-
tiating teams e pect to recom-
mend :l pprol"nl of the agree-
ment to their constituents. The 
lIegoti.ll lol1'l ... continue in good 
faith." 

I he Jispute bega n when 
adm inistrators questioned the 
expira tion dates of the docu-
mentS that govern the co-ops' 
lease agreement in spri ng 
2004. Origina lly, ssociated 
Student!> and the GSA leased 

the space from University 
Centers under a Master Space 
Agreement. The four co-ops 
- Groundwork Books, the 
C he Cafe, the Food Co-op, and 
the General Store - then sub-
let the space from Associated 
Studen t~ and the GSA under 
the terms of a ,\t1cmorandulll of 

nderstanding. 
Admin istrators at University 

Centers refused to renew the 
Master Space Agreement after 
it expired Apri l 2004, calling for 
negotiations to modify its terms. 
An October 2004 date was set 
for the month-to- month lease to 
expi re, un less substantial prog-
ress was made toward drafting 
a new agreement. Il owever, the 
co-ops have ince continued to 
rent the space on that month-
to-month basi~ until agreements 
arc finalized. 

dministrators and co-op 
officia ls also clashed over the 
expi ration of the MOU. While 
the co-ops' attorn ey, Lottie 
Cohen , had argued tha t the 
MO had no legal expi ration

• Increases 
By MAn L'HEUREUX

In response to a 41 million dol -
lar ... tate budget Cllt, the University 
of Ca lifornia Board of Regents has 
rai,ed fees to .. elect professional 
;chools for 1005-06 by 7 percent. 

Despite four professional schools 
Oil campus, UCSD rem3111S largely 
una ffected hy the increase. The 
Skaggs School of Pharmacy is the 
only graduate school to raise its 
prices, with 200S-06 tuition increas-
ing an add itional $ 00. 

The new increase raises gradu-
ate school tuition as much as 10 
percent at some schools, when eOIll -
bined with increases pas~ed in 200-+. 
At 'chools affected by this proposal, 
the UJition hikes range from as little 
a., $136 to 776. long with their 
decision, the regents passed further 
"temporary" increases for the 2006-
07 ~chool year designed to help 
alleviate the funding gap created hy 
budget alterations. 

The vote, originally sched-
uled for ,\t1ay, was deferred until

Textbook prices inflated by 
sales tactics, report finds 

GAO highlights 'bundling' as 
contribution to increasing prices 
8, CHRlmNE CLARK 

Senior Staff Writer 

A national report released by 
th e Govern ment Accountability 
Office in July concluded that the 
price of textbooks ha ri en at 
twice the rate of inflation in the 
last twO decades, largely due to 
of the sa les tactics of publishers. 

Frequent new editions and 
the grouping of textbooks with 
su pplemental material - a pro-

CC~5 kno\\ n as "bundli" I(' - have 
contributed to the increased cost 
of te.nhooks, llccording ro the 
repon. 

The repon stared tha t ris-
mg com associated with prod-
uct de,ign, including CD- RO,\1s 
.1I1d other suppl ement, is thc 
most 5ignificant factor in text-
honk pric ing. It revealed that 
textbook prices have increased 
an avenlge of 6 percent a year, 
nearly trip ling si nce Dece mber 
1986. In addition, the report 
found that textbooks sold over-
seas were less expensive when 
co mpared to textbooks sold 
domcstica lly. 

Rep. David Wu (I)-Ore.) , ~1 
member of the Ho use education 
cO lTllllirrce, rC(luested a GAO 
investigation after he received 
complaints from constituents 
abollt high textbook pri ces, 
acco rding to spokeswoman 
Gillian Schoene. 

"A~ a result of the report , 
we have some hard data that 
suppo rts that bundling has led 
to the increased COSt of text-
books," • choene said. "Students 
are ~omctimes having to spend 

[up] to $900 and it is hurt-
ing their ability to tak.e certain 
classes. Students are trying to 
get around buying teKtbook.s 
by buying some, but not oth-
ers. IThis campaignl fall s within 
[Wu's] greater efforts to make 
higher education accessi ble." 

Although the report con -
cluded that publishers are partly 

re~ponsiblc for the rising cost 
of textbooks, it also lists ~cv­
e ral o ther reasons fo r the price 
increases, includin g a pa ra ll e l 
ri se in college tuition . 

ll owevcr, publi shers say they 
arc se ll ing new materials to 
accompany textbooks in order 
to meet the demands of profes-
ors, according to sociation of 

American Publishe rs Executive 
Director Bruce ll ildebrand. 

Il ildcbrand also said that all 
rhe suppl emental materials cre-
a ted by pu bl isher a re des igned 
to enha nce the educational expe-
rience . 

"The tests you take on lin e , 
the overhead sheets th e profes-
sor u es, all of those materials -
God didn 't make them, publish-
e r did ," Hildebra nd said . "All of 
those material are produced by 
publishe rs in orde r to faci litate 
the needs of higher education." 

But Ca lifornia Public Interes t 
Resea rch ,roup, which ha been 
fighting against the rise of text-
book prices, said that the report 
supports its campaign.

Co-op: Each location to 
have separate agreements 

continued from page I 
date, Director of Student Po licies 
and Judicial Affairs icholas 
Agui lar stated in a letter analyz-
ing the MOU that the document 
had expired in May 1998 and was 
never renewed. 

Administrators at University 
Centers then refused to renew 
the MOU, requiring that the 
document first include proposed 
changes in the lease and operating 
policies. 

The negotiations have con-
tinued since then, with the most 
recent meeting occurring in June 
2005, at which point the par-
ticipants agreed to reconvene this 
quarter to finalize the agreements. 
Acting Assistant Vice Chancellor 
of Student Life Gary R. Ratcliff 
said that the co-ops are continu-
ing to openite and will be open 
in the fall. 

Ratcliff also said that a new 
branch of the Food Co-op, which 
will be dubbed the Food Co-op 
Satellite, is in construction and 
will be completed in the fall. The 
satellite branch will be located on 
the upper level of Price Center, 
next to Shogun. 

The satellite is currently 
being governed under its own 
leasc agreement with University 
Centers, but will have a finalized 
agreement once negotiations are 
resolved, Ratcliff said. The new 
agreement will feature "separate 
agreements for each location with 
similar language," but more spe-
ci fic tenns for each co-op, accord-
ing to Ratcliff. 

Thurgood Marshall College 
Senior Senator rute Pillon , who 
serves as A.S. representative and 
srudent negotiator, said that 
incorporating separate agreements 

would be an effective plan . Under 
the expired contracts, the co-ops 
were regarded as one entity. Thus 
if one co-op breached contract, 
aU four would have been affected, 
she said. 

"The basic fOffl1a t should stay 
the same, but having separate 
agreements will allow the co-ops 
to be considered individually, 
which is a positive thing for the 
co-ops as well," Pillon said. 

The negotiations have made 
strides since last year, according 
to Chancellor Marye Anne Fox. 
Despite the departure of key par-
ties to past discussions, including 
fOffl1er A.S. President Jenn Pae, 
the outlook is positive, she said. 

"In the beginning, negotiations 
were in disarray, with huge fric-
tion between all parties," Fox said. 
"But now, we've managed to put 
them into rooms with a mediator, 
and we're on the verge of closing 
the issue. Yes, we wish that we 
had come to a resolution before 
some negotiators had to leave the 
school, but the co-ops operating 
this year [without an agreement in 
place] is an indication of trust that 
we can move past that. " 

Negotiating parties will recon-
vene in the following weeks to 
resolve remaining points and 
work on issues of structure and 
language in the new lease agree-
ments. Student negotiators also 
expressed certainty that the co-op 
issue is nearing a solution. 

"We just have a few more 
crucial issues to resolve, but 1 feel 
confident that everyone will be 
happy with the final agreements," 
Pillon said.

UCSD receives grant 

for stem cell research 
UCSD has received $3.6 mil-

lion as part of the $3 billion in 
research grants approved by voters. 
Specifically, the university will use 
the funds to offer training in stem 
cell biology and medicine for a total 
of 16 scientists currently enrolled 
at UCSD's School of Medicine, divi-
sion of biologica l sciences, Skaggs 
School of Pharmaceutical Sciences 
and Jacob's School of Engineering. 

The training will be developed 
through collaborations between 
the univerSity, Burnham Institute, 
Salk Institute and Scripps Research 
Institute. 

NA major goal of this program 
is to train a cadre of young scien-
tists and clinicians who can apply 
their background in fields including 
biology, chemistry, materials science 
and engineering to solve problems 
in basic stem cell research and in 
the development of potential stem 
cell approaches to understanding 
and treating human diseases,' stated 
Lawrence S. B. Goldstein, head of 
the training program, in a press 
release. 

University fundraising 
passes S750 million 
UCSD's $1 billion fundraising 

campaign reached a milestone earlier 
this month, hitting the $757.7 million 
mark through donations from over 
77,000 alumni, parents and friends 
of the university. The seven-year 
crusade for funds, dubbed ' Imagine 
What's Next.' has been used to 
finance several priorities, induding 
student outreach and scholarships 
and faculty retention. Donations also 
helped launch UCSD's new phar-
macy and management professional 
schools. 

"Today we are more than 75 per-
cent toward our campaign goal, but 
there is still much work to be done,' 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox stated in 
a press release. 

The university said tha~ currently, 
half of the donors are friends of the 
university, 28 percent are alumni, 15 
percent are parents, and 7 percent 
are corporations, foundations and 
organizations. 

Poll reports negative 
student loan impad 

Roughly two-thirds of Americans 
with student loans say that debt is 
keeping them from making large 
purchases such as a car or home, 
according to an index poll conducted 

••• 

by the Cambridge Consumer Index. 
Over 20 percent of those sUNeyed 
currently, or will in the near future, 
make payments on student loans. Of 
those paying off loans, 30 percent 
find their debt to be a "major bur-
den: while 34 percent find it to be 
a "minor burden' affecting purchases 
of such things as real estate. 

Thirty-seven percent also 
answered that student debt has no 
effect on their spending habits, an 
increase from the last year's 25 
percent. Results were complied after 
a monthly nationwide telephone 
poll conducted by International 
Communications Research of more 
than 800 adults. 

Legislation offers aid 
in wake of hurricane 

Rep. George Miller CD-Calif.), 
the ranking member of the House 
Education and the Workforce 
Committee has partnered with Rep. 
Dale Kildee (D-Mich.) earlier this 
month to introduce H.R. 3690, 
titled the Katrina Relief Act, to aid 
students affected by the hurricane. 
About 100,000 college students 
and dozens of colleges have been 
impacted by the disaster, according 
to a committee press release. The 
bill would grant the secretary of 
the U.S. Department of Education 
the power to waive the required 
retum of student grants, such as Pell, 
TRIO and Supplemental Educational 
Opportunity Grants, when students 
withdraw from college due to a 
disaster. 

The legislation also gives the 
secretary the authority to alter the 
"expected family contribution: or 
how much affected families are 
expected to pay for the current col-
lege term and the next academic 
year. 

Finally, the act would defer the 
payments on college loans for stu-
dent borrowers who live in affected 
areas by six months. During this 

defermen~ loan interest win not 
grow. 

UCSD is offerin~ several options 
for those affected t>y the hurricane, 
according to university spokeswom-
an Pat Jacoby. Options include a late 
enrollment opportunity for students 
who did not accept their admission 
to UCSD, but cannot attend their cDI-
lege of choice because of the hurri-
cane. Undergraduates and graduates 
who were not offered admissions 
to UCSD, but cannot attend college 
because of the disaster, are being 
offered enrollment with University 
Extension. The university is allowing 
a leave of absence or delayed admis-
sions, of up to one year, to students 
directly affected by the disaster.

Under a provision of the 2002 No

While students and parents may 
request that private infonnation not 
be turned over by schools, they can-
not prevent miliwy collection of

Critics of the act are especially 
worried about issues of civil righ ts 
and privacy, particularly violations 
ofFERPA, which seeks to limit the 
dissemination of personal infonna-
tion to thi.oo parties. 

"We have written letters to San

Nararajan, stllff attorney for the 
American Civil Liberties Union 
of Southern California . "The 
[Department of Defense) needs to 
respect [student and family] wishes 
and should be very careful about 
what is compiled ... we are making 
sure [the deparunent] compiles the 
very minimum necessary." 

On its Web site, the Electronic 
Privacy Information Center states, 
"The Department of Defense 's 
handling of this database has clearly 
violated [FERPA) . The continuing 
collection, use and maintenance of 
a system of records provide a basis 
for legal action and congressional 
oversighL" 

The collection of Social Security

tion increases the risk of identity 
theft should such infonnation fall 
into the wrong hands, according to 
the E.P.I.C. Web site.

Fees: UC students file suit 
against regents for fee hikes 

continU2d from page I 
dents at the May meeting reached 
an impasse debating the necessity, 
implementlltion and impact of the 
fecs on both professional students 
and faculty in the upcoming year. 

"We need the ability to keep 
those fees to finance the programs 
that will help us strive for excel-
lence," UCLA Anderson School of 
Management Dean Bruce WIllison 
said. 

Although close to 95 percent 
of Skaggs' srudents are on finan-
cial aid, Associate Dean Anthony 
Manoguerra said he is ~hopeful" 
that the increase will not adverse-
ly affect the accessibility of the 
school to students. According to the 
University of California Office of 
the President's proposal, 25 percent 
of money raised by the additional 
fees will be earmarked for tudents 
in need of financial aid. 

The implementation of these 
fees "[varies] by school, campus and 
residency status, depending on the 
financial needs and market com-
petitiveness factors of the individual 
professional school," said UCOP 
spokeswoman RaviPoorsina. 

In addition to the 7 percent 
increase at their August meeting, 
the regents approved furthur fee 
increases, including a temporary 
professional school fee increase of 
$1 ,050, beginning in winter quar-
ter 2006 and ending at the end 
of the 2()(};, school year. Students 
at UCSD professional schools of 
phaffl1acy, management and medi-
cine are all subject to the nigher 
fees. 

UCSD's Graduate School of 
International Relations and Pacific 
Studies is ellempt from both 
increases because a previous hike 
requires students to pay an addi-
tional $4,000. However, IRiPS 

Business Officer John Rowe said 
he is deteffl1ined to ensure that fees 
remain reasonable in comparison to 
other similar graduate schools. 

Although some regents at the 
May meeting expressed regret at the 
possibility of further fee increases, 
others felt them necessary in the 
face of heavy budget cuts. Regents 
gave a variety of rea ons for the 
increases, including low tuition lev-
els and professor salaries in compar-
ison to similar universities and the 
neccssity for program funding to 
retain the university's reputation . 

However, two students have 
already taken legal action against 
the university, claiming breach of 
contract due ro the late notice of 
the fees implementation. The suit, 
LuquetliJ u. UC Regents, is the sec-
ond class action brought in San 
Francisco Superior Coun against 
the University of California by stu-
dents concerning fee increases. 

In 2003, a group of UC students 
filed Koslnniri v. Regtmts, where San 
Francisco Judge Jame Warren 
granted a preliminary injunction 
stopping additional fees from being 
collected. Judge Mary Wiss will 
rule on an adjudication hearing fo r 
Luquetta v. UC Regents Oct. 3. 

"We do not undertake these 
additional increases lightly," C 
President Robert C. Dynes stat-
ed in a press release. "They are, 
unfortunately, necessary to sustain 
the academic program and student 
financial aid in the wake of the seri -
ous budget cuts." 

Rowe expressed similar con-
cerns, saying officials at IRIPS are 
keeping wary of " the impact of any 
increases in fees and ruition 011 our 
current and prospective students."

Coming this fall: A battle for the future of San Diego 
Lines in 
the sand 

Ian S. Port 

San Diego's City Ilall is a nondescript modernist office tower nestled in a downtown 
c ivic center of nondescript modern-
ist office towers. You could drive 
right by and not notice it, except 
you can't really drive by: Only the 
San Diego Trolley and pedestrians 
get to use C Street out front. 

Drive~ headed to the Hall get 
swooped up into a parking garage 
and spat out onto a cement con-
course surrounded by the workaday 
forest. eed to find a council meet-
ing or the mayor's office? They're 
inside one of the now-faded beige 
boxes around there somewhere. 

But of course, most San Diegans 
don't ever need to find City Hall. ill 
"America's Finest City," the philos-
ophy of government is that it's one 
of those things people wony about 
in places "~th bad weather. 

Because decades of its citizens 
haven't paid attention, San Diego is 
now up to its eyeballs in a political 
and financial hurricane, the kinds 
that last for decades and wash away 
bundles of politicians, bureaucrats 
and tax dollars by the time they 
finish . 

It's easy to itemize some of the 
harshest realities: 

- A pension deficit of at least 
$1.4 biUion (likely much higher), 
which basically means that the city 
owes its employees far more money 
over the next few years than it plans 
to coUect. 

- Ongoing FBI investigations 
into the city's mystical account-
ing practices (they · hired EnrOll'S 
accounting finn) that ultimately 
keep the city from passing bonds to 

do things like fix roads or improve 
schools. 

- A city council which, after 
watching two of its members go to 
jail for fraud and corruption in July, 
has nwnerous vacant seats, no real 
leader and no capacity (or mlling-
ness?) to bite into the hearty plate 
of big problems facing it. 

The problems go beyond one 
issue, body or action, threading 
instead through much of San 
Diego's past. We had a city gov-
ernment that, until recently, was 
basically run for developers and 
businessmen, an original popula-
tion that came from small towns 
and tried in vain to 

" 

story, though : Republican nominee 
Francis ran a TV campaign mth the 
help of top GOP advisers (having 
few good ideas himself). Harley-
Davidson dealership owner Myke 
Shelby ("New York Myke" to his 
friends) easily convinced everyone 
he was going to beat them up if he 
didn't win. La Jolla attorney Pat 
Shea (whose ~fe blew the whistle 
on the city's ruined pension fund) 
said with Harvard eloquence that 
the only way out of the city's mess 
was court-run reorganization - fil-
ing for bankruptcy. 

With such a diverse pack, it 
seems a bit strange that the only two 

keep San Diego 
one and a local 
newspaper that 
doesn't like to 
report anything 
ugly. 

So if national 
and state politics 
weren't so excit-
ing these days, a 
no-bull telling 
our fair town's fall 
could entertain 
the country better 
than a so-called 
"summer block-
buster." But no use 

Because decades of 
its citizens haven't 

paid attention, San 
Diego is now up to its 
eyeballs in a political 

and fi:nancilll 

primary survivors 
have almost exact-
1y the same stance 
on The Big Issue, 
that doggone pen-
sion deficit. Both 
Sanders and Frye 
think they can

ees off the expen-
sive benefits (mat

crying over spilt milk - instead, 
we ought to be crying about the 
upcoming mayoral election: the 
most imporrant choose-msely-or-
pay challenge possibly to ever face 
the voters of paradise. 

It began as a circus mth II can-
didates - II hu71llm ones, anyway, 
because Nevada businessman Steve 
Francis was clearly too much of 
a snake to pass for a hrmro SJlpim. 
Most of them had a disappointing 
night on July 26, when all but City 
Councilwoman Donna Frye and 
former police chief Jerry Sanders 
were eliminated in the primary. 
The cast of candidates tells its own 

their head. 
That - or perhaps mth the 

call-me-by-my-first-name chann 
they share - is where the candi-
dates' similarities end. 

The ralJ, blond Frye entered 
politics through environmental 
activism. She owns a surf shop mth 
her husband, famous surfer and 
board shaper Skip Frye, and is seen 
by her die-hard supponers as a sort 
of Christlike mortal enduring the 
filthy fray of politics for the good of 
San Diego. She goes by "Donna," 
speaks with a plain, disarming 
humanity, and nearly always calls 
reporters back to answer questions 
- even when their deadlines have 

obviously passed. Oh yeah, another 
poetic detail: Excepting one judge's 
ruling that her name written on a 
baUot wasn't enough, Frye would 
be San Diego's mayor right now. 
(The guy who won in her stead, 
Dick Murphy, stepped down four 
months after "wiruUng. ") 

Her opponent, Sanders, is a 
round, ruddy-faced ex-cop who 
looks and talks exactly like a big-
city mayor. Though he's not the 
slash-and-bum kind of Republican 
Fr.ll1cis was, he's got some of the 
city's top conservative advisers in 
his war room, and mth Francis 
out, he's the go-to vote for San 
Diego right-wingers. Sanders has 
good credentials, having brought 
a couple of nonprofits back from 
the brink when he ran them, but 
his biggest strength is that he is 
eminently likable - a dangerous 
quality for a leader in don't-bother-
me San Diego. Mister mismanage-
ment Murphy won as the vanilla 
candidate, his former campaign 
manager told me, and Sanders is 
running on me same platfono: lots 
of press conferences, few specif-
ics. Just remember, Jerry: everyone 
knew Francis' vague posturing was 
bullshit. 

With twO nice-guys who SOrt of 
agree running against each other, 
how ugly wiIJ fall campaigning 
get? Hard to say. Frye has always 
exploited her populist reputa-
tion ~th grassroots eampaigning; 
Sanders has establishment sup-
port, thousands of pretty signs 
and probably more than twice me 
money of his opponent. One thing 
is for sure: If San Diegans are ever 
going to pull their heads out of the 
sand and move to get the kind of 
city we all want, now would be a 
good time.

Summer 
wasn't at all 

care--free 
The Roam 
& Ramble 
Maryann Kimoto 

I 'm about as ready to give up my summer vacation as J am to put a bullet through my head. 
Having no suicidal tendencies, 

it should be safe to assume that 
I've been clinging to my last few 
days of freedom ~th surreal dread. 
Summer? What summer?! I grew up 
mth this silly notion that vacations 
were for laid-back idleness and good 
times, but it seems to me that aside 
from the scalding heat, the most I 
got out of this summer were 12 UC 
units, a painful sunburn and a lot of 
bad news. 

All sununer, there wasn't one 
moment where I could flip through 
the channels, turn a page in the paper 
or scan a Web site without being 
accosted by gruesome news: There 
was the lingering search for Natalee 
Holloway in June, the London train 
bombings in July and the threat and 
subsequent carnage of Hurricane 
Katrina in August and September. 
Ranking as the 10th deadliest natu, 
raj disaster in American history, it 
doesn't take a psychic to realize that 
campus organizations will be scram-
bling this Welcome Week, if not 
for the rest of the year, to fulfill one 
goal and one goal only - donations 
to offset the destruction wrough t 
by Katrina. A grand ambition of 
national proportions, the relief effort 
is a beautiful show of unification, 
which inevitably raises the ques-

New court ruling threatens the freedom of college newspapers 
Hats 
off 

Vladimir Kogan 

E ven before the New York Times' Judith Miller started rotting in jail for her role 
in the Valeriegate controversy thi.s 
summer, a federal court decided, 
quite jovially, to castrate college 
newspapers. While American 
troops fought for "democracy" and 
"freedom" in Iraq, the court invited 
college administrators to establish 
their own authoritarian regimes 
right here, in America's very own 
public universities. 

It all happened in June, in a case 
known as Hosty v. Cllrter, when 
the Federal 7th District Court 
of Appeals gave public university 
administrators in L1Jinois, lndiana 
and Wi consin the power to review 
many campus' student newspapers 
prio r to publication and to cen-
sor them for reasons as silly and 
arbitrary as being poorly written or 
lacki ng proper grammar. 

The court derived its ruling 
from a controversial 1988 Supreme 
Court case, known as Hazelwood v. 
Ktlh/meiN', which gave administra-
tors at public high schools great 
authori ty to regulate thei r student 
publication - even though the 
court majority wrote in Hazelwood 
that it specifically did not apply to 
universities. 

In the early 1800s, when the 

Supreme Court heard one of its 
first federalism cases, it conclud-
ed that power to tax was "power 
to destroy"; for newspapers, the 
power to censor unflattering or 
unfavorable material is no different, 
and that's why I'm so worried. 

In an awfully wrinen and melo-
dramatic editorial, UCLA's Daily 
Bruin concluded that the decision 
"could topple the very foundations 
of a university'S mission." Not 
quite, but it could come close. 

Quite incorrectly, the Daily 
Bnlin argued that the court's rul-
ing has no effect on California. [f 
the Supreme Court was to uphold 
the decision, or if our own 9th 
Circuit used it as a precedent and 
ruled similarly, California's col-
leges would be in big trouble. And 
students attending UC campuses 
would be especially hurt. 

Thanks to an explicit free expres-
sion protection added as a section 
to the state 's Education Code in 
1977, California high school stu-
dents were largely protected from 
the fallout of Hazelwood in the late 
I 980s. Unfortunately, in its current 
form, this section applies only to pri-
mary and secondary schools, not to 
universities. While lawmakers could 
go back and expand me protections, 
any new law - short of a consti-
tutional amendment - would not 
be binding on UC administrators 
because of the autonomy granted to 
the VC Board of Regents under the 
sta te constitution . 

f won 't hold my breath for the 
regents to suddenly discover dIe 
value of the unregulated press, 

given their terrible record on the 
issue. The university's standing 
policies for student media, adopted 
in the 1970s, give the chancellor 
of each UC campus almost com-
plete authority over student papers, 
including the ability to review the 
content of the publication. In an 
e-mail last spring to the Guarditm, 
university lawyer Steven G. Rosen 

" 1 won't hold my breath for the regents to suddenly 
discover the value of the 
unregulated press, given 
their terrible track record 

on the issue. " 
explained that the policy is currently 
not enforced, and that it was prob-
ably even illegal. However, Rosen 
wrote the e-mail several months 
before the 7th Circuit decision, and 
the university could now be having 
second thoughts. 

While the UC faculty-con-
trolled Academic Senate has fought 
its 12vorite social ills like the Patriot 
Act and restrictions on academic 
freedom, the body seems to have 
found no time over the past three 
decades to object to the universi-
ty's own totalitarian restrictions on 
student papers and urge for their 
repeal. I have little hope that they 
mil start standing up for student 

press freedoms now. -
Aside from my worst-case sce-

narios, though, this summer's deci-
sion does have practical effects 
on California, thanks to a strange 
legal principle known as "quali-
fied immunity." Essentially, quali-
fied immunity provides blanket 
protection against lawsuits for 
government employees no matter 
how guilty they may be, just as 
long as they don't violate "clearly 
established" constitutional rights. 
fn Hosty, the district court con-
firmed what most of already knew 
- that the press freedom of college 
journalists was just such a "clear-
ly established" right and that by 
violating it, college administrators 
could find themselves in court. But 
this decision was reversed by the 
appeals court. 

In practical terms, this changes 
the calculus of all college admin-
istrators, including our very own 
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Joseph W . Watson. In the past, 
Watson and his colleagues may 
have hesitated before infringing on 
rights of student journalists for fear 
of being sued. Aher Hosty, how-
ever, the First Amendment rights 
of college papers are no longer 
"clearly established," thus making 
individual administrators, including 
Watson, immune from lawsuits. 

Now, if students believe their 
rights have been trampled upOn, 
they will have to go after entire uni-
versities - mth their armies oflaw-
yers - and not individual Watsons, 
who can censor with impunity. Few 
student newspapers would have the 

resources to challenge the UC sys-
tem, mth its team of more than 30 
lawyers, even if their rights have 
been legitimately violated. 

I'm certain that the consequenc-
es for students will be severe. Aher 
HIIU/wood, schools used their new-
found censorship authority to block 
the publication of information on 
birth control and to prevent can-
didates from competing in student 
government elections because mey 
made "rude comments" to admin-
istrators. As the four dissenting 
judges wrote in June, Hosty opens 
the door for unimaginable restric-
tions on expression on college cam-
puses, too. 

In the short term, the decision 
mIl lilc.ely have a chilling effect on 
the number of enterprising and 
investigative stories published by 
student papers, stories challenging 
the official feel-good press releases 
put out by universities. The long 
term looks much scarier. 

It used to be that university 
papers were simply an extension 
of the "marketplace" of unfiltered 
discussions that universities rep-
resent in our society - places 
where innovative ideas came to 
fruition and official bureaucrats 
possessed no monopoly on infor-
mation. Thanks to Hony, though, 
it could just be all too soon utltil 
the GUllrJitm becomes Big Bromer 
Watson's sanctioned Propaganda 
Ministry.

'TtJESDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 2005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

'Kimoto: Worthy humanitarian causes are 
buried under Hurricane Katrina relief efforts 

continued from page 4 
tion: Can there be too much of a 
good thing? If every booth, every 
organization and club on campus, 
if not most of the country, dashes 
to the rescue of one cause, who will 
champion the day-to-day tragedies 
of local and national poverty, sick-
ness and need? 

A prime example of this recent 
trend is the Red Cross. Although 
the Red Cross publicly encour-
ages donations to be made to the 
National Disaster Relief Fund, it is 
seeing a surge of funds specifically 
restricted to Hurricane Katrina 
relief - which is particularly wor-
risome because the general disaster 
fund, at last count, was at less than 
half its desired balance. Katrina has 
already overshadowed local dona-
tions in cities such as Vallejo, Calif., 
where unrelated nonprofits are see-
ing a dip in giving while struggling 
to maintain local humanitarian 
efforts. The Indian Ocean tsunami 
aid appeal last year similarly slowed 
donations toward other disaster 
relief efforts of less dramatic pro-
portions. The current famine in 
Niger and the recurring droughts in 
Ethiopia have garnered little media 
attention - and have received a 
proportional amount of aid. 

The generalization of the men-
tality of most people [ know would 
be that of "The Donor." 

The Donor can be typified as 
the average passerby, perhaps with 
a penchant for donating twenties 
found under thc couch, or full bot-
des of change once in a long while. 
ill essencc, The Donor is a creature 
of habit who commits to a cause or 
two a year, while shelving out a mere 
pittance for other charities of noted 
value in the meantime, and wakes 
up satisfied of humanitarian urges 
thereafter. While agencies scramble 

to focus on one crisis a t a time, 
the people who suffer continually 
will need the help of The Donor 
just as they did before Hurricane 
Katrina, even if The Donor has 
only so deep a pocket for so many 
causes. Hopefully, Library Walk 
this Welcome Week will reflect the 
global sense of giving, and Katrina, 
rather than simply diverting money 
from one ClIuse to another, ~Il 
inspire a new breed of do-gooders 
instead - the type that will be bet-
ter able to stick it through with the 
long-teno business of the restora-
tion of New Orleans. 

That aid efforts for Katrina are 
on track to ClIcced those of Sept. II 
and the tsunami - even in such an 
economic environment - sparks 
an awe of the human spirit. It's 
no seLTCt that the average car's 
gas tank has become a bottomless 
pit into which half of one's pay-
check can be deposited. Coupled 
with the prohibitive cost of student 
parking passes and the filct that 
T don't have many "S" spots to 
return to at Warren College any-
way, 'I'm downright ecstatic that 
I'm not bringing my car to San 
Diego, something that would have 
been unheard of last year. Forced 
intO carpooling for the past three 
years, I had hoped that my senior 
year would see a newer, indepen-
dent me. Mc, groveling for a ride? 
Not this year l Unfortunately, my 
$20 can't stretch quite like it used 
to at the gas tation, and has since 
decided that it would prcfer to stay 
in my pocket for the luxury of 
coffee runs and midnight snacks, 
among other things. 

In the end, it seems to me that 
I have two options when it comes 
to putting a price on independence 

- moving to Venezuela where 
gas is currently 12 cents a gallon, 
or finding another job. While a 
job may seem reasonable at first, [ 
have braved Career Services ofren 
enough to realize that the faU quar-
ter rush is not for me. Being the 
lab nerd that 1 am, I know that jobs 
for even the most menial of duties 
(think biohazardous waste disposal) 
have insanely competitive applica-
tion pools, especially at the begin-
ning of the year. As a freshman , 
I f.mtasized about cancer research 
and cell cloning - and was turned 
away from "mice coupling" after 
my interviewers informed me that 
they had received over 100 applica-
tions ... not only from over-eager 
first years such as myself, but from 
seasoned juniors and seniors with 
loads more desperation and a tran-
script of course skills to offer. Yep, 
no contest. It was the first time 
in my life that I had tasted bitter 
defeat in the job market and though 
the past few years has definitely 
jaded me to that particular experi-
ence, 1 still carry the lingering fear 
of the stampede that is fall quarter 
job-hunting. I wouldn't msh such 
psychological scarring on anyone. 

I'm not going to weep over my 
lost summer. Yes, I may have 
squandered it on things of my own 
making, swnmer school included, 
but it did bring to the forefront 
issues that have been disregarded 
in the past: the need to deal mth 
siruations such as the appalling 
condition of the impoverished side 
of New Orleans htfore Katrina; or 
Americans learning a new respect 
for the high gas prices that have 
long becn fclt in other parts of the 
world. And sunscreen.

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 2005 TIlE UCSD GUARDIAN OPINION 7 

How to succeed in college: Get involved in campus life 
Great 
Expectations 

carol Freire 

Perhaps this wasn't what you imagined college would be like. Welcome to UCSD. 
If you're a freshman , orienta-

tion likely wasn't long enough for 
you to notice that there are only 
two weather settings in La Jolla: 
"London" and "Phoenix." Sorry. 
Also, although that aerial photo-
graph makes the beach appear only 
two inches from the Geisel Library, 
it's actually a bit of a walk - so J'm 
betting you'll go twice this quarter, 
tops. You'll probably be too busy 
working on your running form 
anyway, trying to make it from 
York to Warren Lecture Hall in 10 
minutes. The most overwhelming 
thing about college is the mountain 
of reading; you'll already be behind 
on the first day of class, guaranteed. 
You're likely already drowning in 
the obligatory flurry of club pam-
phlets and bureaucratic forms that 
come with every new school year. 

Take heart: Thousand of stu-

for team 
events 

dents have made it through UCSD, 
and unless you're worse than all of 
them, so can you. Most of the stuff 
handed to you is rubbish, so be a 
dear and recycle it. 

Don't bother with optional 
reading unless you have the power 
to slow down time or have concrete 
plans to ask for a leuer of recom-
mendation from the professor. 

One thing you do want to read 
is the class syllabus. If you raise 
your hand to ask a question that 
is answered on the syllabus, the 
entire class will mentally slap you 
upside the head. If you actually ask 
a question that can be answered 
by "it mayor may not be on the 
final," someone in the class might 
actually do it. No one likes point 
grubbers - especially professors . 
And although you think you can 
be anonymous in a 200-person 
class, over the course of 10 weeks 
your nameless personality shines 
through. Your classmates will 
secretly nickname you things like 
"Extra Credit" or "Sweat-Panted 
Garden Gnome." You don't wanr 
to be "Grubby" for the rest of your 
college career, do you? 

Fir t, if upon walking into your 
section, the TA breathes fire and 
flaps his green scaly wings, bolt

for the door and change secrjons 
immediately, for the TA deter-
mines your grade. 

As you attempt to make friends, 
you will naturally engage in shallow, 
polite chit-chat. Unless you want to 
desperately disengage the person, 
do not talk about how high your 
S.A.T. scores were. No one cares. 
Especially since they changed the 
scale. As far as all the upperclass-
men are concerned, we took the 
S.A. T .s on stone tablets, sometime 
around the sixth century B.C. 

Another qukk way to stop a 
conversation is to start whining 
about how there is nothing to do 
in San Diego. That's sending a 
signal to tune you out. I've already 
tuned myself out writing this sen-
tence. 'If you have questions, ask 
your Resident Advisor. RAs get 
food, board and Triton Plus ca h 
just to an wer your question, so 
make them earn it. They'll at least 
be able to point you to the beach, 
a burrito srand, Ralboa Park, Old 
Town, etc. 

After a week, you may notice 
that San Diegan wear flip flops at 
all times. If you lind this distasteful, 
at the very le~st wear a rubber pair 
in the shower. You can go ahead and 
assume your roommate pees in the 

shower. I'm serious. Also, you don 't 
want to be the stinky roommate: 
Shower, brush and usc deodor-
ant. It will save you embarrassing 
and awkward conversations. 
I can go on, because I'm pompous 
- but I won't. As the world's lead-
ing expert in campus life and most 
important person ever, 1 don't want 
to rob you of the opportunity to 
learn through experience - you'll 
need the college blunder stories for 
your grandchildren. There are lots 
of little things to learn about col-
lege: Walking will always be faster 
than taking the shuttle, a parking 
pemlit is marc like a lottery ticket 
than a pennit, and keeping your 
keys on a push pin by the door will 
save you the grief of constantly 
misplacing them. But none of these 
are as important as joining an orga-
ni7A1tion. 

[f you take away nothing else 
from your first quarter in school , 
takr this: Join a student organiza-
tion. The reason you've heard this 
50 times is because it's true. Above 
aU, this is the single, unequivo-
cal key to a happy college experi-
ence. You'll probabl y forget half 
the things you learn in class, as 
well as three quarters of the people 
you meet there, but you'll meet 

interesting people at student orgs, 
and if you're lucky, find a pas-
sion therein. Everyone want!> to 
meet interesting people who ca n 
become Ii fclong friends. There 's 
a sn,dent organi7.ation for every-
thing: sports club ~, newspapers, 
religious groups, student councils, 
television stations, theater troupes, 
inging groups, communi ty service 

organizations and pre-professional 
societies. UCSD has a place for 
the vegan socia list environm en-
taJjst and the carnivorous young 
Republican . Caricature aside, 
UCSD is thriving with interesting, 
multidimensional people. 

So go meet them! The best 
way to meet interesti ng people is 
to be interesting. To paraphrase 
William Dean H owells, tile uni-
versally intere ting are the univer-
sally interested . So make rhe best 
of your time here and go poke 
around different meetings. Perhaps 
you will develop a few interests. If 
notlling else you' ll take adva ntage 
of the free footl bonanza that hap-
pens first week. Good lu k!

Nurses: Mediator to release 
a report on facts of dispute 

Books: Publishers seek solution to prices 

mndnued fr()m /Xlge I 
blocked th e walkout, at the 
requ est of PERB and the univer-
sity. On Sepf. 2, McMaster ruled 
that the union could not strike 
until the conclusion of a manda-
tory irnpa se process, as required 
by state law. 

"The firm positions that UC 
has maintained .. . although in 
disagreement with CNA's posi-
tio ns on the issues, are mistakenly 
characteri zed either as refusals to 
bargain or as attempts to condi -
tion a successor agreement upon 
CNA's acquiescence in UC's posi-
tions, H McMaster's ruling stated 
in response to union complaints. 
"Indeed, C A' positions on the 
issues appear to be just as firm as 
UC's positions and may suggest, 
not a refusal to bargain or condi-
tional barga ini.ng, but a point of 
impasse within th e meaning [of 
the lawl ." 

The decision fru strated nurs-
es, according to the CNA's chief 
negotiator J oe Lindsay, though 
the uni on has not yet decided 
whether it would appea l. 

"There was di sa ppointment 
and di agreement with the deci-
sion th at the judge made," Lindsay 
sa id. ' Bu t we recogni zed that th e 
PERB has been ta ken over [by] 
appointees of th e governor and 
tha t th is was a very politica l deci-
sion. Nu rses were disa ppointed 
but not shocked. " 

C urrently, both sides are wait-
ing fo r a sta te mediator to con-
duct a fact- findin g in vestigati on, 
though th e unive rsity has un ilat-
era lly implemented its proposed 
wage increases fo r next year. Van 

infamous for its nur ing short-
ages. 

rna press release, C A 
called McMaster's ruling 
" th e latest illustration of Gov. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger's ongo-
ing attack on" registered nurs-
es. Since last year, the union 
and Schwarzenegger have been 
involved in a bitter dispute over 
the governor's attempt to block 
an increase in the required nurse-
to-patient ratio in the state's hos-
pitals, regulations that the gov-
ernor contended would have put 
several hospitals out of business. 

The union 's decision to fol-
low the governor to many of his 
public appearances helped set off 
Schwarzenegger's battle with the 
state's public employees' unions, 
a dispute that largely precipitated 
the dramatic decline in support 
for his policies among state vot-
ers. 

"The Court feels compelled to 
first state what this case is NOT 
about," McMaster stated in the 
opinion. "It is not about whether 
th e services of nurses are highly 
valued. No one has contended or 
commented to the contrary. It i 
not about whether staffing ratios 
arc a good idea or not - that 
issue has not reached th e court in 
this proceeding." 

Ilowever, C NA has called its 
negotiations an el(tension of the 
union's political di spute with tile 
govern or, pointing out that four 
of fi ve PERB members have been 
appointed by Schwarzenegger and 
th at he serves as the pre ident of 
th e C Boa rd of Regents, though 
th e title is large ly a formality.

wrapped with additional 
instructional materials, such as 
CD-ROMs and workbooks," 
CALPIRG Program Director 
Dave Rosenfeld stated in an e-
mail. "Some publishers tell pro-
fessors the CD-ROMs and work-
books are free. The reality is the 
bundled items can dramatically 
increase the cost of a textbook." 

Merriah Fairchild, a high-
er education advocate for 
CALPTRG, said the report 
revealed that publishers use bun-
dling to artificially inflate the 
price of textbooks. 

However, Hildebrand said 
that bundling is a result of tech-
nological advances in the teach-
ing methods of higher educa-
tion . 

"[Bundling] is due to the 
evolution of the Internet and 
the student," Hildebrand said. 
"Students aren't willing to give 
up their computers. Times have 
changed, so publishers are lead-

" The tests you take 
online, the overhead 

sheets the professor uses, 
all of those materials -

ing the way." 
Nonetheless, publishers, poli-

ticians and CALPIRG all said 
they are trying to find solutions 
to the rising cost of textbooks. 

"Students in the short term 
can do something to try to lower 
the costs of textbooks by buying 
[books] on international Web 
sites," f'airchild said. "The only 

drawback is you have to wait for 
the shipping." 

In addition, Hildebrand said 
publishers are creating new 
alternatives to conventional text-
books, including the develop-
ment of online books, custom 

te~tbooks and abbreviated edi-
tions. 

Schoene said that as a result 
of the report, Wu is trying to 
create legislation that will enable 
students to buy more affordable 
textbooks. 

Wu also added an amend-
ment to the College Acccess and 
Opportunity Act to stem rising 
textbok costs, Schoene said . 

The amendment lists specific 
recommendations to textbook 
publishers, faculty and book-
stores to help make textbooks 
more affordable, including seil-
ing texts "a la carte," or without 
supplemental materials.

Fo~: Appointed committee to report findings on undergraduate student life 
continued fr.om page I 

standy," Fox saId of the univer-
sity. "There are things that I hoped 
would be finished and were not, but 
I'm confident we're developing in 
severa I areas.· 

Fox met with several media out-
lets on the cusp of her one-year 
anniversary as UCSD chancellor, to 
recollect, reassess and plan ahead. 
After six years as chancellor at North 
Carolina State University, Fox began 
her UCSD administration with 6ve 
specific goals: "Improve students' 
quality of life," "address diversity," 
"foster more interdisciplinary activi-
ties," "continue innovation in teach-
ing and research" and "increase 
interrultional activities on campus." 

Upon arriving, Fox established the 
Undergraduate Studenr Expe.rience 
and Satisfaction Committee, which 

will repon their findings publicly 
on UCSD undergraduate life early 
this quaner, she said. For now, the 
most obvious improvement that can 
be made to the student experience 
is housing, Fox said. Her ambitions 
aimed to bolster the transfer student 
housing by establishing a S 120 mil-
lion donn project that would house 
1,000 transfer students. 

Fo~'s plan to eomplete the devel-
opment by 2009 may have been 
delayed severely in her first year by 
the UC Board of Regents. 

"I had high hopes to complete 
pla.ns for developing more on-
campus housing," Fox said. "Our 
debt capacity at the state level has 
thwarted us from approval by the 
board. But I still hope that it can 
be accomplished, since I see it as an 
integral part of improving college 

and Clmpus life for students." . 
Budgetary shonfalls also stunted 

Fox's goal to establish a finn out-
reach plan. 

"We fought for the outreach case 
at the UC level, but Gov. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger put it out of the 
state budget completely," she said. 
"Politicians and legislators are look-
ing for accountability, which is 
something we're going to have to be 
creative in creating." 

The main problem with showcas-
ing outreach as an effective retain-
ment and recruionent tool, Fo~ said, 
is traclcing students over long periods 
of time. That difficulty doesn't deter 
her from her belief that outreach 
remains important to education. 

"Visiting civic organizations in 
San Diego, I found some communi-
ties and high schools don't convey

what [the) expectations are to their 
students," she said. "We need to 
stan early, and establish a tine of 
connection with these students, who 
otherwise wouldn't have any oppor-
tunities with a UC school." 

Another important byproduct of 
outreach is diversity, Fox said, which 
she found to be laclcing when she 
arrived at UCSD. The shortcom-
ing is especially evident in black and 
Latino populations on campus, Fox 
said, which numbered at I and 2 
percent last year, respectively. 

Fox highlighted the Preuss School 
as a prime example of UCSD's Out-
reach efforts. The school, whose 
student body is over 90 percent eth-
nic minorities, provides an intensive 
college preparatory curriculum to 
low-income students. 

"We're very proud of the Preuss 

school," Fox said. "When we admit 
them [to Preuss), we don't ask about 
their grades, but simply that they are 
willing to work hard." 

Presenting the Preuss School, 
where over 90 percent of students 
attend college, as an accountable 
outreach model would make a strong 
budgetary case at the UC level, Fox 
said. 

Some student leaders, however, 
are wary of the university's focus on 
the Preuss School. 

"In my experience with certain, 
specific administrators, [preuss] 
seems (Q be the only outreach 
UCSD is interested in," said Kyle 
Samia, Student Affinnative Action 
Committee represen tative to the

THE UCSD GUARDIAN FOC'U I'; 

A new challenge for an old truce 
After four decades, California's Master Plan begins to feel its age 

Iy VLADIMIR KOCiAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

T he way University of California officials like to tell it, the state's Master Plan for 
Higher Education is as much a quin-
tessence of California as the grizzly 
bear, the Golden Gate Bridge and 
the Be2ch Boys_ 

Providing a long-renn arrange-
ment for a three-tiered higher edu-
cation system, they credit the 1960 
document with developing a vision 
that has resulted in economic pros-
perity and international renown. 
Like a fine Napa chardonnay, the 
plan brought the sophisticated tastes 
of quality higher education tradi-
tionally reserved for the rich and 
elite to every high school graduate 
in California. Its model was evenru-
ally exported to other states, which 
wanted a refined bottle of their own. 

"The Master Plan is lauded as the 
most brilliant structure for higher 
education," Regent George Marcus 
told the rest of the UC B03rd of 
Regents in a meeting last year. His 
view enjoys a wide following on the 
board and within the university. 

Popular tradition credits the plan'~ 
origins to a comrnittee of wise, schol-
arly men - and they were almost all 
men - led by then-Gov. Pat Brawn. 
They said in their final report, lel 
there be college education for all; 
and there was college education for 
all. 

"They were pretty visionary in 
1960 and what they saw was a necd 
for both mass education, and, at the 
same time, they were interested in 
creating a really high quality educa-
tion," UC Director of Educational 
Relations Todd Greenspan said. 

However, its romanticized history 
and the Master Plan's near-sacrosanct 
stmis largely conceal a much more 
pragmatic and nuanced story about 
how the document came into being. 
And that real story suggests that the 
plan, in its current conception, may 
not be around for too much longer. 

Battle for the Golden Fleece 

T he popular intelligent-design theory behind the Master Plan's drafting differs greatly 
from the reality - a self-interested 
truggle between the UC system 

and the stare colleges, the forerunner 

to dlC Califclmia Stall' Ll nl\'cl',il~ 
system. 

"Everyone looks back at. the 
Master Plan as being noblc, and 
it was. But it also involved a lot of 
rcal-world nitty-gritty politics," said 
Ethan Rarick, author of "C1lifomia 
Rising," a new biography of Brown 
that examines the governor's role in 
the plan's creation. 

At the heart of the conflict was 
universities' "Golden Fleece" - the 
ability to award doctorate degrees. 
The state colleges wanted it and 
UC campuses didn 't want to give 
its doctoral monopoly LIp, fearing 
that a stronger competitor with elite 
degrees would reduce the C por-
tion of the higher education pie in 
the state budget. 

"It was really the competicion 
between those two systems - that 
was really wh3t caused the Master 
Plan to go forward," said Rarick. 
who also currendy serves as the 
acting director of the Center on 
Politics at UC Berkeley's Institute of 
Govemmcnt.11 Srudies. "The foc",ll 
point of that competition was the

11JESDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 2005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN FOCU 17 

P.lan: UC and CSU campuses fight 
for issuance of doctoral degrees 

mmmlled from l){lg~ 15 
doctornt ." 

Though C administrnrors now cmbmcc 
the document with .open anTI!>, Rarick's book 
suggests that the university's initial acquiescence 
came much as :1 result of a threar from stare 
lawmakers delivered by Brown. Despire being 
credired as the futher of the plan, the threar was 
largely the full extent to the governor's direct 
role in cr~fung the compromise. 

"'TIIC academks must come to an agree-
ment, or the politicians wou.ld do it for them," 
Rarick said, describing the thrusr of Brown's 
message. 

Archived UC memos suggesr dlat the uni-
versity's interest in the project was not all that 
alrruistic. ' '''hen the state Legislarurc's top 
policy analyst A. Alan Po t was suggested to 
lead the commlttec that would write the omni-
bus higher education blueprint, the university 
balked, fearing that he might stray where he 
was not welcome. 

"I mention to you also the dangcr dlat such 
a role might provide the opportunity for Alan 
to dig into delicate matters of reaching load, 
expense accounts and other matters which 
the university tended to obscure," university 
administrator Dean Mel Jenry stated in a letter 
to dlcn-UC President Clark Kcrr, a document 
cited in Rarick's book. 

Ar the cnd CSU camplL'iCS won the ability 
to issue oilly joint doctorate degrees with the 
UC system, Kerr preserved the elite nature 
of his university, thc stdte got a vision for the 
future and posterity saw the birth of an urban 
legend. 

"Today, the Master Plan is secn as evidence 
of California's commioncnt ro higher educa-
tion, and that's true, but it was originally a 
peace treaty ill a political fight," Rarick said in 
an intcrview. "And the university's chief motiva-
tion was to maintaiJI its pre-emincnce above dlC 
colleges and to make surc the collcges did not 
evolve into a research institution." 

Story of changing times 

K err's own words show how much the statc has changed since the birth of dle Master Plan . Speaking beforc faculty in 

1957, Kerr famously explained d13t his j bas 
chancellor - at the timc, he was till the head 
of the Berkeley campus - had bewme defincd 
a "providing parking for fuculty, sex for thc 
students and adl lcrics for dlC alwHni." 

These days, parking has become a perennial 
is ue in student-govcrnment elections on UC 
campuses. The fdculty-Ied Academic Senate, 
on the other hand , has largely found new li fe in 
passing re olutions that weigh in on everything 
from the Patriot Act to the Collcge Board's 
National Merit Scholarship Program. And only 
three of the 10 UC campuses even have a foot-
ball team. 

Despite the Master Plan's support for the 
"principle that state [CSU] colleges and the 
University of California shall be tuition free to 
all residents of the state," fees at both systems 
have skyrocketed in recent years. 

There are also signs that the plan's caps on 
enrollmem - limiting UC campuses to the top 
eighth of high school grdduates and CS cam-
puscs to the top third - may be diseonnected 
from the needs of a technologically driven 
economy that did not exist four decades ago. 

Speaking before a House of Represcntatives 
subcommittee this J unc, one of President 
George W. Bush's top advisers on science and 
technology policy complained that the nation 's 
demand for engineers continues to greatly out-
pace its number of engineering graduates. In 
1998, UC campuses graduated nearly one out 
of every 30 engineers in tlle nation, suggest-
ing that increasing engineering rank~ would 
li kely entail building new C campuses anrl, 
pcrhap , adjusting the enrollment goals of the 
Master Plan. 

"The question that is really on everyone's 
mind is: [s it still relevant?" said J ennifer 
Lilla, fomler presidcnt of the UC Student 
Association, a lobby group tllat represents C 
smdents ... In the Master Plan, there was always 
Lhis presumption that, of course, K-12 leduca-
tionl is always going to be strong and, ofcoursc, 
wr're going to have a public education systcm. 
And I dlink you can make thc argument that 
ncither of tllOse is tme any longer."

Plan: 
An evolving 
document 

conrinu£d /rom fJage 17 
At the time they signed on to 

the plan, UC administrntors feared 
that the university would lose state 
money if CSU campuses became 
more powerful. Since the 1970s, the 
UC system's share of the state gen-
eral fund has faUen from 7 percent 
to 3.5 percen t. But the most of the 
money went to pay for new prisons, 
not to the state colleges. 

Yet Greenspan, the head of the 
university's educational relations, 
believes that the document has stood 
the test of time. 

"1 think it was the era of ratio-
nal planning - Sputnik and aU of 
that stuff,» he said, explaining that 
the plan's authors crafted a vision 
that accurately foresaw the changes 
that the subsequent decades entailed. 
"Even though society and everything 
has changed, I think it's stiU an effi-
cient method. No other state has so 
many highly rankcd higher education 
institutions in the public sector." 

A fraying coalition 

I n 200 I, the very i sue that brought the two university systems together in 1960 also 
threatened to split t hem apart. 

t the time, CSU administrators 
threw their weight behind a bill to 
give their campuses the power to 
award a doctorates in education, a 
move vehemently opposed by UC 
heads. At the end, the two sides 
made a deal in the Master Plan, but 
the compromise didn't last. 

This swnmer, the CSU drive for 
the Crt>lden Fleece re-emerged again, 
this time in a bill seeking to give the 
state coUeges power to offer doctor-
ates in certain professional fields. 

T he problem, according to 
Executive Director of UC Berkeley's 
[ntemational and Area tudies pro-
gram Thomas J. La Belle, is the 
phenomenon of "credential infla-
tion. " Fortner vice president of San 
Francisco State University, La Belle 
has published an analysi s, outlin-
ing his case for why CSU campuses 
should award docrorates. 

Over the years, requirements of 
various professional practices - like 
physical therapy and audiology 
- have crept up, with the doctor-
ate becoming, in some cases, the 
minimum for a license to practice. 
But UC campuses have shown little 
interest in expanding doctorate pro-
grams into such applied fields, La 
Belle concluded in his report. 

In draftin!! the Master Plan, the 
authors did not take into accollnt the 
changing demands of the market-
place and the gradual increase in the 
necessity of higher degrees. 

"I don't think any of them pre-
dicted well, and Pm not sure that 
they could have," La Belle said. 
"Nothing works exactly like you 
think it should. I don 't know that 
it's possible to do it, but I think you 
need to build a system that is flexible 
enough to anticipate changes:' 

Though UC and CSU leaders 
reached yet another deal this sum-
mer, giving CS call1PLL'iC-~ power to 
offer only the education doctorate, 
La Belle said he doubts that sta te 
colleges' appetite will sta}' satisfied 
for long and that they will likely 
come back to ask for 1I10re doctorate 
programs, as professional standards 
continue to cllmh. 

"My own feeling is tl1at, yeah, 
it probably will happen," he said. 
"Sooner or later, it will happen." 

Greenspan, too, sa id the univer-
sity doubts that the current com-
prOlnise will pacify CSU campuses 
for long. Lnstead, L.:C administrators 
have established a task force to try 
to predict future changes in demand 
for advanced degrees, and adjust the 
university's own curriculum accord-

ing~. 
What we've decided is that the 

UC should be looking forward, " 
he said.

THE ONE-UNIT UNDERGRADUATE SEMINAR SERIES 
Have you experienced impossibly large lecture rooms with hundreds of students in attendance? Have you 
wondered how you would ever be able to have discussions directly with professors? Have you ever been 
interested in a subject not directly related to your major, but didn't feel you have the time to fit four more 
units into your schedule? Do you need only one or two more units to graduate? 

The One-Unit Undergraduate Seminar Series has helped address these questions for over 17 years, 

ONE-UNIT SEMINARS offered this fall quarter include: 
• ESYS 90 "Perspectives in Environmental Issues" 
• TDGE 90 "Backstage, Onstage" 
• WARR 90. 'The Internationall.anguage Problem-Can Esperanto Help?" 
• WARR 90 "Humorous Poetry, Popular Songs and Hymn: A Workshop" 
• WARR 90 "Medicine in Society, From Past to Present" 

For a complete list of the courses offered in Fall 2005, visit hffP://JOarren.ucsd.edu/seminars.html. 

The seminars typically meet 8 -10 hours a quarter with an enrollment limitation of 25 students. All 
students are required to do work commensurate with a one-unit, P /NP course. Credits are limited to 4 
seminars (varying in topic) in a student's academic career and do not count towards college or departmental 
requirements. For additional information, email waprovost@ucsd.edu.

Union: 
PERB rejects 
allegations of 
partisanship 

continued from page 10 
tion to silence the voice of UC 
nurses follow months of attaclcs 
by Schwarzenegger on [regis-
tered nursesl," CNA Executive 
Director Rose Anne DeMoro 
stated in a union press release. 

In an interview with the Los 
Angeles Times, DeMoro was even 
more bold, tying in the contract 
ta lks to the dispute over staffing 
levels with the governor. 

"Everything leads back to 
Schwarzenegger," the paper 
quoted her as saying. "There's an 
agenda in the state of Ca lifornia 
basically to reduce staffing ratios, 
to go after pensions and it's all 
playing out here at the University 
of California." 

However, Lindsay, the chief 
negotiator, said the union believes 
the contract dispute has political 
undertones. 

"Our dispute with the UC is 
completely about the contract," 
he said. "But VC's reaction to 
some of the issues that we raised 
we th in L: is affected by the i r 
political commitment with the 
governor. " 

PERB General Counsel 
Robert Thompson - an appoin-
tee of former Gov. Gray Davis, a 
Democrat and Schwarzenegger's 
predecessor - rejected the 
union's claims that politics have 
played a role in the board's deci -
sion to ask for the injunction. 

"That's absolutely untrue," 
Thompson said. "] was involved . 
personally in the investigation in 
the case . There were no political 
considerations at all - we inter-
preted the facts based on the law 
as it currently stands." 

The university has also made 
itself a target of CNA critics by 
opposing legislation sponsored by 
the union that called on hospitals 
to use special equipment to Ii ft 
overweight patients, a practice 
the nurses said was the cause of 
serious back injuries among their 
ranks. Schwarzenegger's decision 
to veto the bill last year was 
met with strong protest from the 
unton. 

The question of lifting regu-
lations also remains a key point 
of contention between the union 
and the university in the ongoing 
contract talks.

Chancellor: 
Fox hopes to 
extend global 

relations 
continued from page II 

bragging about your own puppet 
school? I'm worried that UCSD 
puts the majority of its attention on 
the Preuss School, and forgets and 
disregards other aspects of outreach 
and retention." 

Fox's second year could prove 
transitional, once again, with sev-
eral leading adminiso-dtofli depart-
ing over the summer, among them 
fonner Vice Chancellor of External 
Relations James M. Langley, fonner 
Ass.istant Vice Chancellor of Student 
Life Cannen Vazquez and fonner 
Thurgood M.lIflihall College Provost 
Cecil Lytle. 

Fox's tenure at North Carolina 
State Univefliity was marted by 
1I 2003 resolution, passed by the 
North Carolina State Univefliity 
faculty senate, which overrumed 
Fox's decision to fire two provosts. 
Fox, however, said the departure of 
adminisuatofli in North Carolina 
and those at UCSD are under dif-
ferent circumstances. 

"I'm a bit dismayed when any-
one brings up that topic, sincc I 
would hardly call it a mas exodus 
of adminisuatofli," she said. "'fbis 
was merely a situation where we 
lost good people to othcr job and 
circumstances. " 

Va7Ajuez, currently Vice President 
of Student Affuifli at the nivcfliity 
of San Diego, had nothing but prdi e 
for Fox. Though she has a differ-
ent leadeflihip style dun predeces-
sor Robert C. Dynes, Fox exuded a 
refreshing sense of importancc and 
urgency in topics, Vazquez said. 

"[Fox] is an experienced, strare-
gic and dynamic leader," Vazquez 
said. "IShe] doesn't miss a beat, [is] 
very sharp and has a great sense of 
humor." 

Some campus employees, how-
ever, have complaints about the 
chancellor, according to Son Diego 
Union-T"ibune reports, including 
Fox being ovcrly confrontational 
with staff mcmbefli. 

The work to expand VCSD 
internationally has thrived under 
Fox, who has pushed global edu-
cation since her arrival. Over the 
past year, the univefliity's Centcr 
for Mexican American Studies has 
tapped a staff person to facilitate 
exchanges between UCSD students 
and various Mexican univefliities and 
research centefli. 

Additionally, UCSD, along with 
several other colleges, came to an 
agreement over the swnmer with 
Indian Prime Minister Marunohan 
Singh that will establish strong ties 
between univefliity science and engi-
neering departments and Amrita 
Univefliity in Tamil Nadu, India. 
Amrita'se-leamingcenterwill utilize 
Edusat, a satellite launched by the 
indian Space Research Organization, 
to transmit educational program-
ming to UCSD students. 

But, as with many of her ambi-
tions, Fox feels more progress can 
be made. 

"I'm happy with how the uni-
vefliity has grown, worldwide," Fox 
said. "But we have a ways to go to 
interact more with our international 
partners. UCSD can make the col-
lege life expand to the other realms 
of the student experience. " 

in October, Fox will be on hand 
to <:ut the opening ribbon for a new 
hospital in Shanghai that will be 
offered jointly between UCSD and 
China. Domestically, Fox will be a 
member of a newly established com-
mittee that will advise the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation. on multiple 
subjects, including how to bener 
undcflitand academia and potential 
research topics to enhance national 
security, according to online publi-
cation insidchighered.

~dou alld Marla. 
Dimanche A Bamako 
Nonesuch 

In the pop music landscape, a pro-ducer can guarantee a hit single with just their name, sometimes 
in conjunction with a video cameo. 
But there's also the "fifth Beatie" 
lcind of producer, who writes, 
arranges, plays and sings on their 
chosen artist's album, creating a 
union between producer and artist, 
better than either producer or artist 
alone. Manu Chao is this lcind of 
producer. 

What, one might ask, can a 
Frenchman known the whole world 
over (for catchy third-world trash-
sica) do for Amadou Bagayoko and 
Mariam Doumbia, the blind Malian 
husband-:md-wife folle-soul combo 
who have been paying their dues in 
the West African music scene for 
more than 20 vears? Chao, whose 
ode to Tijuana '(" tequila, sexo, mar-
ijuana") can be recited by approxi-
mately 70 percent of Europeans, 
places the duo's folksy music in the 

**** context of his world beat-informed 
arrangements, instead of the Stu 
Records sound usually emulated by 
the pair. The result is a near-per-
fect blend of the duo's beautifully 
smooth vocals, moumfulJy uplift-
ing lyrics (en frtnlfais), Amadou's 
thick, masterful guitar lines, Chao's 
instrument-heavy yet simple take 
on the West African beat (one 
that reggae ton stole for all of its 
songs) and more than once, some 
French rap. Chao's essence is aural-
ly present on nearly all of the tracks 
(full of street noises recorded in 
Bamako, Mali), but sometimes he 
steps into the foreground, where he 
is more exuberant than ever before. 
By worlcing behind the boards for 
the prodigious pair, Manu Chao 
finally adds a touch of legitimacy to 
his impish repertoire.

BLACK 
REBEL MOTORCYCLE CLUB 

Black Rebe. 
Motorcycle aub 
Howl 

Pay attention , rock twats: If Bob Dylan is one of YOI/I' influences, have the decency to acrua lly 
rework some of the sruff he did. 
At least, don't sink to the depths 
of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club 
on "Complicated Siruation," which 
sounds like a distillation of the first 
few Dylan records into one bor-
ing summary of a infati le folkie's 
dreary wet dream. 

But what sho uld we expect from 
a stylish San Francisco trio that 
basica lly replayed '80s mysterio-
rock with better amplifiers , and has 
now decided to steal rootsy stan-
dards from their own continent? 
flowl isn't awful - about three 
tracks will get you nodding without 
gui lt - but even those are trifles 
compared to the origina ls they 
essentially copy. For their coun-
trylblues album, BRMC call on 

Sony 

Mississippi via pasty Led Zeppelin 
and London via the posruring Black 
Crowes - all the wrong places. 
The album's title track, suppos-
edly a nod to Allen Ginsberg's 
landmark 1954 poem, is about as 
revolutionary as a jar of mayon-
naise: not quite "starving hysteri-
cal naked," though it wi ll get you 
humming along. So will "Promise," 
a nod to Simon & Garfunkel that 
belongs on a Coldplay record . But 
the so-fake voice-and-guitar coun-
try ballads (there are three) that 
cheaply compress Johnny Cash 
like "Complicated Situation" does 
Dylan are painfully indicative: 
BRMC don't seem to realize that 
any good in these songs doesn 't 
come from them.

TollY Yayo 

Yony Yayo was released from jail in early 2004, only to be sent bacle less than 24 hours later for 
srupidly presenting his parole officer 
with a forged passport, which raises 
thc question: Do you realJy want 
to hear the thoughts of this "predi-
cate felon"? G-Unit has continued 
to spread out its troops with the sign-
ing of Mobb Deep and Spider Loc, 
but perhaps too thin, with Yayo's 
puddle-decp Thoughts of a Predicate 
Fekln the result. 

It isn't enough to merely say that 
this album is bad, because it is well 
beyond that. Thoughts epitomizes 
everything ~at is wrong with hip-
hop in 2005. Superficial lyricism, 
lack of originality, uninspired pro-
duction - this CD has it all. With 
song titles ranging from "I'm So 
High" to "Love My Style," Yayo is 
making no effort to give his tracks 
names that haven't already been used 

Thoughts of a Predicate Felon 
Interscope 

by his G-Unit crew. Eminem and 
Obie Trice drop in for a guest spot 
on the single "Drama Setter," a ter-
rible song with an equally terrible 
beat produced by Eminem that uses 
a bassline almost identical to that of 
"Gattman & Robin." Fitty and his 
boys attempt to come to the rescue 
on "So Seductive" and "I Know U 
Don't Love Me," two of the more 
palatable songs on the disc, but other 
songs such as "Project Princess," and 
"Dear Suzie" do nothing more than 
induce nausea. 

Enough was spent on the produc-
tion of this album that there should 
be at least several good songs, but 
~vhere Yayo didn't piss away the 
money on awful beats, he ruins it 
with even worse rapping. Steel wool 
Q-Tips are easier on the ears.

Offensive domination 
leads soccer to big wins 

By RAIL ENnEN 
sports Editor 

When a soccer team starts the 
season 5-1 with two games ending 
with scores of 7-0 and I 1-0 scores, 
you can be sure that that team 
must have the "unstoppable force" 
offense, most commonly used to 
refer to the Indianapolis Colts of 
the National Football League. 
However, the 2005 UCSD wom-
en's soccer team appears to be 
an unstoppable force, steamrolling 
its competition with overpowering 
offense and smothering defense. 

Thc No. 20 Tritons (5-1-0 
overall, 1-1-0 CCAA) are com-
ing off a bittersweet 2004 season 
in which they played well, finish-
ing 14-4- 1, but were snubbed by 
the NCAA and left out of the 
Division IJ Championships - a 
similar ending to the men's soccer 
and men's baseball teams' seasons. 
After being underappreciated in 
2004, the Tritons earned top hon-
ors from the California Collegiate 
Athletic Association coaches by 
being picked to win their fifth 
CCAA title in the last six years. 

The Tritons arc looking to fulfill 
their fates by following the leader-
ship of 19th-year head coach Brian 
McManus. McManus has already 
led the Tritons to two national 
championships and has the talent 
to do so again in 2005 despite the 
return of only two senior: Heather 
Szafraniec and Kristina de la Rosa. 
While the lack of seniors may seem 
like a youth invasion, the TritOns 
are full of experienced young play-
ers who will be around for years 
to come. Juniors Kelly Cochran, 
Megan Dickey and Ileather Sugg 
all have the ability to playa major 
part in the Tritons' attempt at a 
national championship. 

So far this season, the Tritons 
have looked like national champi-
ons during most of their games. 
In their season opener against 
Humboldt State on Aug. 26, the 
Tritons had an impressive showing, 
winning on a goal from junior A1ise 
MaUey with 3.4 seconds left in the 
final overtime period. 

The Tritons followed their 
thriller with a 7-0 killing of 
Western Oregon on Sept. I. UCSD 
seored six second-half goals in the 
game, with Dickey and sophomore 
Lauren Seagars each contributing 
two goals in the win. A week later, 
on Sept. 8, the Tritons maintained 
their perfect record, improving to 
3 -0 wi th an 11-0 victory against 
Central Washington. After seven 
goals in their second game, the 
Tritons could not stop finding the 
back of the net, seoring seven goals 
in the first half alone. Once again, 
Dickey scored early and often, net-
ting four goals in the game to 
give her a team-leading six for the 
year. 

After outscoring their oppo-
nents 18-0 in their last two games, 
the Tritons faced off against No. 
2 Seattle University, their NCAA 
West Region foe. The Redhawks 
looked to give UCSD a real chal-
lenge after seeing the Tritons win 
with ease in their first three games. 
However, Seattle could not keep 
up with the speedy Tritons and, 
although they did not dismantle 
the Redhawks like they did the 
Wildcats and the Wolves, the 
Tritons still managed a solid 4-2 

victory to improve to 4-0 on the 
year. 

The Tritons took their first loss 
of the year on Sept. 13, falling 
in double overtime to Cal State 
Los Angeles in their first game 
on the road and their first league 
game. However, they bounced 
back on Sept. 17 by beating Cal 
State Bakersfield, 3-\. 

With all of the success so far 
this season, the Tritons will look 
to ful fill their hopes of another 
CCAA title. They now await 
numerous road games against their 
league rivals, like No. 12 Cal State 
Dominguez Hills on Sept. 21, Cal 
Poly Pomona on Sept. 24 and 
Sonoma State on Sept. 30. 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN SPORTS 25 

Cross 'country running for top spot 
By MEL ENnEN 

Sports Editor 
Both the UCSD men's and 

women's cross counoy teams are 
coming off impressive 2004 sea-
sons. The women placed second at 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association playoffs and went on 
to finish 17th out of 24 teams in 
the NCAA Division ]] National 
Championships. The men matched 
the women's success by grabbing 
a third-place finish at the CCAA 
playoffs and impressing opponents 
from across the nation by taking 
fourth place in the national cham-
pionships. This year, both Triton 
teams hope to improve on last 
year's finishes and can do so at the 
upcoming Paul Short Invitational 
on Oct. I and the VCSD Triton 

Classic on Oct. 8. 
The Triton Classic will be 

UCSD's last before the start of the 
CCM playoffs. So Far this season, 
thc Tritons have participated in two 
events and showed promisc with 
srrong fin ishes. 

In their first competition of the 
year on Aug. 27, the men's team 
edged out Point Lorna and San 
Diego Christian for a first-place 
finish thanks to a superb individ-
ual perfonnance by senior Ch ris 
Beetley-Hagler, who crossed the 
finish line first in the individual 
race with a time of22 minutes, 32.1 
seconds. While the men battled 
to earn the top spot, the women 
squared off against Point Loma, 
Cal State San Bernardino and San 
Diego Christian and came away 
with a victory, led by senior Mimi 

Hodgins' top time of 15:04. 1. 
Since the uccess of their first 

meet, the Trimns have competed in 
the UC Irvine Invi tational on Sept. 
10. With more competition at the 
meet, the Tri ton mcn sti II m~lIlaged 
to place fifth out of 12 reams while 
the women took fourth place out 
of 17 teams. Individually, llodgins 
led the UCSD women again with 
a second-place overall fini h and a 
time of 18:26.9. The men did not 
have a major individual leader, with 
their best time coming from Carl 
Lostrom, whose time of 23 : 11.9 
earned him a tenth-place finish. 

The men's and women's squads 
have each looked impressive in their 
limited action so fur this year. ow, 
the teams must prepare for the Paul 
Short lnvitational in BethJeham, 
Pa., as well as the Triton Classic. 

Life Sciences' innovative 
of Bioscience (MBS) program 

pares scientists and engineers 
to be the bioscience industry 
leaders of the future.

Volleyball 
team off to 

hot start 
Tritons carry two-

game win streak 
and 10-2 record 

., RAEL ENTEEN 
Sports Editor 

School has yet to start, but the 
members of the UCSD women 's 
volleyball team have been keep-
ing busy enough. The No, 12 
Tritons have already played in 
the Ca l State Dominguez Hills 
Tournament and the Cal State 
San Bernardino Tournament as 
well as home games against Grand 
Canyon and Cal State Monterey 
Bay. Now, less than a month into 
the season, the Tritons have played 
21 games and are off to a good 
start with a 10-2 record overall 
and a 2-1 mark in league play. 

The Tritons began the sea-
son with three straight wins in 
the Cal State Dominguez Hills 
Tournament over Bridgepoint, 
Point Lorna Nazarene and 
Concordia. UCSD then came 
home to play Point Loma and 
came away with a win before 
heading to the Cal State San 
Bernardino Tournament with a 
4-0 record, 

At their second tourney in a 
week, the Tritons beat unranked 
St. Martins and Northwest 

azarene on Sept. 2 and Sept. 
3. respectively, ami beat No. 16 
Northwood in straight se ts on 
Sept. 3. However, the Tritons also 
took their first loss of the season at 
the tournament, falling in straight 
sets to No. 8 Hawaii Pacific on 
Sept. 2. . 

Following their impressive 
showing in the Cal Smte San 
Bernardino Tournament, the 
TritOns returned home for a ept. 
8 win over Grand Canyon. Toting 
an 8-1 record, the Tritons then 
rerurned ro San Bernardino for a 
matchup against the No.2 Coyotes 
on Sept. 10. Once again, the 
Tritons ran into trouble against a 
ranked opponent, this time falling 
1-3 to the powerful Coyotes. After 
their second loss of the year, the 
Tritons grabbed two quick wins 
from Cal State Monterey Bay and 
Sonoma State at home on Sept. 
16 and 17 to bring them to their 
current record of 10-2, and 2- 1 
in California Collegiate Athletic 
Association matches. 

This 10-2 start marks an 
impressive debut for head coach 
Tom Black, who began coaching 
the Trituns this season. Black, a 
UCSD alumnus and a star Triton 
volleyball player from 1993 -96, 
was appointed head coach of the 
Tritons after working as an assis-
tant coach for the University of 
Southern California over the last 
two seaSO]ls. Black's intoroduction 
comes on the heels of the TritOns' 
record-setting 30-win season last 
year. Their 30-2 mark was good 
enough for a NCAA Division II 
Tournament berth, where they 
played well enough to advance to 
the Pacific Regional Final. 

The Tritons look to make it 
to the D-H Tournament again 
this year, although they lost all 
of their 2004 starters to gradua-
tion and have to adjust to a new 
coaching staff. Despite these chal-
lenges, UCSD will look to be in 
the thick of the playoff race come 
November,

Water polo looks toward 
seniors for leadership 

Tritons get three wins in SoCal 
Tournament to improve to 11-2 

By IAEL ENlEEN 
Sports Editor 

The 2005 UCSD men 's water 
polo team opened up its season 
at borne at its very own invita-
tional, hosting the UCSD Triton 
Invitational on Sept. 3 and Sept. 4, 
in which UCSD went 3-1 against 
four nationally ranked teams from 
across the country. 

In their season opener, the No. 
7 Tritons (11-2, overall) beat up on 
No. 18 Whittier College to win their 
first game, 17-1 . Later that night, the 
Tritons defeated No. 17 University 
of Red lands by a score of 15-8. With 
the wins, the Tritons advanced to the 
semifinal round where they played 
then-No. 7 UC Irvine and earned 
a spot in the championship by edg-
ing the Anteaters in an 8-7 overtime 
win, thanks to senior driver Chris 
Eichholz's late score. The win put 
them up against No.6 Pepperdine in 
the championship later that evening. 
However, by the time the stars lit 
up the night sky, the Tritons were 
already on their way to a tough loss, 
11. -8. The Waves never allowed the 
Tritons m take a lead in a victory 
spearht'aded by Adam Hewko's six 
goals against the Trimns. 

Following the Triton 
Invitational, the team traveled 
to the East Coast for a game in 
Pennsylvania and four in New 
Jersey. On Sept.9, the Tritons beat 
Bucknell 15-7 before traveling m 

Princeton, N.J., for the Princeton 
Invitational on Sel»t. 10 and Sept. 
I t. At the meet, the Tritons went 
4-0, beating Queens 21-5, St, 
Francis with a score of II-lOin 
overtime, Gannon with a score of 
16-2 and Princeton 11-9, in the 
final game. 

Winning five games in three days 
all on the road led the Tritons into 
a week-long rest before starting the 
Southern California Tournament 
on Sept. 17. UCSD beat No. t3 
UC Davis in their morning game 
with a final score of 13-6 but lost 
the nightcap to No.2 Berkeley, 8-6. 
In the nen day's games, the Trimns 
added two more victories in games 
over No. 6 Long Beach State and 
No. 5 Pepperdine with scores of 
11-10 and 10-9, respectively. 

The Tritons have plenty of 
upcoming games to improve their 
record and improve on their 2004 
season, in which they went 20-12 
and earned a spot in the NCAA 
Tournament. A fter their most 
recent tournament, the Tritons 
will face Loyola Marymount at 
home on Sept. 23 before head-
ing north for the UC Santa Cruz 
Slug Fest on Sept. 24. Head 
coach Denny Harper will need to 
lead his team full of experienced 
seniors through a tough Western 
Water Polo Association chedule 
and to the NCAA Tournament, 
where it will look to improve upon 
last year's 12th-place finish. 

Men's soccer upsets D--II 
defending champions 

By RAEL ENTEEN 
Sports Editor 

Following a solid 9-4-4 record 
in the 2004 season, the No. 15 
UCSD men's soccer team began 
its 2005 schedule with three wins, 
including a shutout victory over 
the Division 11 defending national 
champions, the Seattle University 
Redhawks. 

The Tritons (4-1-0 overall , I-
I California Collegiate Athletic 
Association) played textbook soc-
cer in their first three games, 
outscoring their opponents 8-0 in 
three shutout wins. The first game 
was a 4-0 victory ovec Humboldt 
State on Aug. 26, followed by the 
2-0 win over the No. 2 Redhawks 
on Sept. 4. On Aug. 7, the Tritons 
maintained their streak by disman-
tling the Western Washington 
Vikings' defense in a 2-0 victory. 
The games against the Redhawks 
and the Vikings were played 01'1 . 
the road in Washington. 

Although they started strong to 
open the season, the Tritons could 
not maintain their perfect record 
when they played Cal State Los 
Angeles on the road on Sept. 13 
in their first California Collegiate 
Athletic Association game of 
the season. The Tritons, led by 
senior Academic All-American 
Matt Davey, fell ill overtime to 
the Golden Eagles and Mark Van 
Gorkom, who scored the game-
winner in the seventh minute of 
the first overtime. 

Davey has been adding to his 
already stellar career numbers at 
UCSD, with four goals and two 
assists through the Tritons' first 
five game~. _ Davey. who .already . 
ranks amo.Jlg the;' top-\ Q in career 
goals and assists at UCSD, scored 
both goals against top-ranked 
Sea'ttle and one each against 
Humboldt State and Cal State 
Bakersfield. 

With Davey'S leadership 
and athleticism, the experience 

of senior goalkeeper Edward 
Ruhland, and a supporting cast 
of seniors like Nick Marquand, 
Grant Nishio and Jon Krupanst..J', 
the 2005 Tritons have earned 
widespread respect. Many coach-
es around the CCAA are so 
impressed with this year's team 
that they picked the Tritons to 
win their first CCAA title this 
year. The CCAA coaches ranked 
the Tritons as the second-place 
team in the South Division and 
predicted that UCSD would go 
all the way to the championship 
game and win it all. 

So far, the Tritons' play has 
lived up to expectations. With the 
victory against Seattle, the Tritons 
ended the Redhawks' 13-game-
home winning streak and were the 
first Division II team to shut out 
Seattle in their last 32 matches. 

Head coach Derek Armstrong is 
respo,!sible for molding this year's 
Tritons into a top-notch team. Now 
in' his 23 rd season as head coach, 
Annstrong co.ntinoes to improve 
the Tritons, year after year. After 
dominating t.\le Division III com-
petition; ArIDstrOilg and his players 
gladly accepted a move to Division 
n five years ago and have proven 
that they can handle the higher skill 
level. Last year, Annstrong won 
his 300th game at UCSD, mak-
ing him and women's coach Brian 
McManus the only two coaches at 
the same school each with 300 wins . 
Annstrong now faces the challenge 
of living up to the ever-increasing 
pressure on the Tritons to succeed. 

It is still eady in the season, 
and the Tritons must look for-
ward to some tough matches in 
the .¥leelcs to come. On Sept. 21, 
tjte .T.ritons '!ill attempt to go 2-0 
against ranked teams when they 
face their league foe, No. 6 Cal 
Stite·DoOUriguezHills. From here 
forward, the Tritons will face oppo-
nents from the CCAA, including 
Cal Poly Pomona on Sept. 24 and 
Sonoma State on Sept. 30. J
