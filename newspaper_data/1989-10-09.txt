Brush Fire Sweeps Through 
UC-Owned Skeleton Canyon 
By RANDY DOTINGA 
Senior Staff Writer 

A brush fire blackened approxi-
mately six acres of a UCSD-owned 
canyon south of campus on Thurs-
day. 

The fire in Skeleton Canyon, 
located west of Allen Field on 
Torrey Pines Road, was reported 
to the San Diego Fire Department 
at 12:19 p.m. Thursday. 

The point of origin of the fire 
was the "southwest comer of the 
canyon. It basically moved up the 
canyon because of the southwest-
erly or southern wind," Third Bat-
talion Chief Bob Roppe said. He 
added that the wind was 'a "moder-
ate" 10-15 miles per hour, with 
gusts of 20-25 miles per hour. 

The fire department responded 
with 15 groups of firefighters and 
equipment, Roppe said. The spe-
cialized groups included both a 
brush fire strike team and a struc-
tural fire strike team, each consist-
ing of five pumpers, Roppe said. 
He added that about 60 firefighters 
were present. 

Although the fire came within 
100 to 150 feet of houses on Bor-
deaux Street, there was no damage 
done to any structures, SDFD 
Public Information Officer Larry 
Stewart said. 

He added that the firefighters' 
efforts were hampered by "steep 
terrain and brush that had not been 
burned for years." 

Roppe said flames went 20-30 
feet h}gh, noting that the heavy 
brush fueling the fire made it "in-
tensely hot." The fire was con-
tained at I: 15 p.m., Roppe said. 

George Shor said the fire "burned 
a fair- ized patch of an area that we 
have set as an ecological study 
area" of natural brush land. 

Shor aid that although the 
canyon area consists of a group of 
coastal chaparral vegetation which 
is becoming rarer, the fire was "not 
a disaster." 

"It is not an unknown thing," 
'Shor said, "for brush areas to bum 
over. My suspicion is, that with a 
fast-burning fire like that, there 
wiIJ be a lot of the [plants] sprout-
ing right back up, and within a few 
years it wiIJ look just the way it did 
before, except the brush won't be 
as high." 

Shor added that "it is a real 
problem to have . . . houses built 
right next to a natural reserve area, 
[because] if one is going to retain 
the native wildflowers and vegeta-
tion, then one can't clean out the 
'weeds and brush,' because that's 

the same thing. 
" As the natural vegetation 

grows, it gets dense, tinder-dry, 
and eventually burns. . . 0 you 
build fire breaks. That's all you 
can do," he continued. 

He added that, although a road 
is to be built in the next year near 
the canyon, bringing fire hydrants 
closer to it, this will not solve the 
"long-range problem" of the pos-
sibility of brush fires in the can-
yon. 

"It's an internal contradiction. 
If you wantto keep natural vegeta-
tion in an urban area, you can't 
win," because one must either cut 
the brush, thus destroying the na-
tive plant life, or face the risk of 
brush fire, he said. 

As to reports of people living in 
the canyon recently, Collins said, 
"in the course of our work in that 
area we have found evidence of 
people living there."

John Buono, a detective with 
the Metro Arson Strike Team, said 
the fire did not appear to be delib-
erately set. Instead, Buono said, 
the fire was likely caused by "a 
cooking fire in one of the many 
'houses' that are constructed down 
in the canyon area. We feel that it 
was probably started by a transient 
who was living in the canyon." 

SDSU Paper Ad Policy Revised 

Judith Wesling, director of the 
La 1011a Soccer League, which 
plays at Allen Field, said she had 
recently seen signs of people liv-
ing in the canyon. 

"They made a brush canopy on 
their little campsite," she said. 

According to Tom Collin , 
as ociate director for administra-
tion at Scripp In titute of Ocean-
ography (SIO), the canyon is part 
of the original Scripps land ac-
quired in 1907, and is a native 
plant reserve. 

As ociate Director of SIO 

By RANDY DOTING A 
Senior Staff Writer 

The San Diego State University 
Publications Authority Board 
Wednesday approved a new ad-
vertising policy for the Daily Az-
tec, ending a one-month ban on 
abortion service advertising by the 
paper. 

The ban began in September, 
after Editor in Chief Jon Petersen 
announced that the paper would no 
longer accept abortion ads. 

Petersen said abortion ads 
would violate the paper' written 
policy to not accept adverti ing 

that serves "primarily to oppress 
the rights of a certain group as 
determined by the editorin chief," 
because abortion takes "the life of 
an unborn human being." 

Petersen's ban on abortion ads 
raised objections from SDSU 
students. On Sept. 19, the SDSU 
Women's Resource Center held a 
rally to protest the Daily A:tec's 
advertising policy. The rally re-
portedly drew 200 people. 

Womancare, a local health 
clinic. withdrew its ads from the 
paper and urged other advertisers 
to take action if Petersen' ban 
wa allowed to continue. 

Daily A:tec Account Execu-

tive Brian Busta said some adver-
tisers had withdrawn their ads as a 
result of the abortion ad ban. 

The Publications Authority 
Board (PAB), which acts as the 
Daily Aztec's publisher, on Aug. 
23 declined to approve the adver-
tising policy upon which Petersen 
drew his authority to ban abortion 
ad . 

The PAB later set up a commit-
tee of Daily A:tec staffmembers to 
form a new advertising policy. This 
committee, by a vote of 5-2 on 
Sept. 22, amended the paper's 
adverti ing policy to include the 
word "legal."

Criteria 
Set For 
NewUCs 
Andrew Klingeler 
Daily Californian 

The UC Board of Regents last 
week established rules forchoo -
ing sites for the three new cam-
puses scheduled for construction 
in the next decade. 

A report on the criteria for 
evaluation of possible UC cam-
pus sites developed by the Bech-
tel-SRI International consulting 
group was adopted at the Sept. 
15 meeting of the UC Regents at 
UCLA. 

Complete copies of the re-
port, with detailed tandards for 
physical ite evaluation, should 
be available within ten days, 
University spokesperson Rick 
Malaspina aid yesterday. 

The decision-making process 
is planned to continue until 1991, 
Malaspina said. In October, the 
Regents are expected to choo e 
50-60 of the most promising site 
for consideration and, by 1991 , 
univer ity officials will have se-
lected three final campus loca-
tion from the initial options. 

"The greatest cost will be in 
the consulting fees and the work 
they're doing," Mala pina said. 
"Right now we have $500,000 in

Huttenback Strikes Back 
Former UCSB Chancellor Robert Huttenback, con-

victed in 1988 of embezzling over $100,000 from the 
University, was in court again last Monday, hoping to 
receive a court order forcing the UC Regents to lift his 
suspension from teaching and restore his salary. 

Robert Gerstein, a former UCLA law professor and 
counsel for Hutrenback, said Tuesday he was optimistic 
Huttenback would be allowed to return to teaching, or at 
least have his pay reinstated. 

Huttenback and Gerstein argued that the University 
did not afford the former chancellor due process in 
imposing the suspension and terminating his pay, be-
cause Huttenback's criminal convictions are still under 
appeal. 

"I think it went very well," Gerstein ~aid. The judge . 
. . was seriously thinking about the argument ." 

According to Gerstein, Santa Barbara County Supe-
rior Court Judge Ronald Steven said he would reach a 
decision within the next few days. 

Huttenback said last month he believed " the law is on 
our side," but added that the case has become a "highly 
political issue." 

Huttenback was suspended with full pay by Chancel-
lor Barbara Uehling in Sept. 1988, one day after his 
conviction. Huttenback was also convicted of five 
felony counts of tax evasion for failing to report the 
embezzled funds as income. All convictions are cur-
remly being appealed, but that case is not expected to be 
heard for several months. 

Last July, the Regent stripped Huttenback of his 
$84,000 salary and said he would be dismissed entirely 
should his convictions be upheld.

protest federal anti-drug pledges. 
A group calling itself Defend Our Personal Ethics 

(DOPE) urged students not to sign the statements re-
quired of those receiving federal financial assistance 
college grants. 

"We' re going to beat George Bush on the war on 
drugs," said a 23-year-old sophomore who would not 
identify himself. 

During the demonstration, attended by about 2,000 
people, an eight-foot mock "joint" made of paper and 
wire was set ablaze in front of the University administra-
tion building. 

Many of the students also joined in sharing 500 
marijuana cigarettes that were distributed at the begin-
ning of the hour-long lunchtime rally. There were no 
arrests. 

Some 3 million students nationwide receive the so-
called Pell Grants. As part of the Bush administration's 
war on drugs, students receiving the grants are required 
to sign an oath stating they will not use or make illegal 
drugs .

More Treatment for 
Heart Attack Victims 
Kevin Knopf 
Scince Editor, UCSF Synapse 

Doctors may begin to treat coro-
nary heart disease with a new class 
of compounds called lazaroids. The 
compounds are currentl y undergo-
ing testing in animal studies, and 
the results appear promising. In 
animal models of a heart attack, 
the compounds appear to decrease 
the amount of damage suffered by 
the heart muscle, which will ulti-
mately preserve more of the heart 's 
function. . 

A heart attack is caused by a 
loss of blood flow to the heart 
muscle itself. This loss can be 

caused by a plaque, a "plug" in the 
coronary artery, and preventive 
measures are aimed at reducing 
the ri sk of acquiring these plaques. 
If the plaque grows too big and 
cuts off circulation to the heart, a 
hean attack can result. Loss of 

Check-U 
blood flow causes damage to the 
heart by reducing the amount of 
oxygen delivered to the heart. 

Drugs have been designed to 
dissolve these plaques during a 
heart anack, but a significant prob-
lem is that when blood flow is 
restored to the heart tissue, addi-
tional damage can result to the 

tissue. This is called "reperfusion 
injury" and is thought to be due to 
tree-radicals that are generated 
during reflow. These free radicals 
are actually chemically unstable 
oxygen molecules. 

The experimental compounds 
seem to transform the free-radicals 
into normal oxygen, which has no 
damaging effects to the heart tis-
sue. Ideally the lazaroids could be 
used at the same time as clot-dis-
solving drugs to minimize the 
damage caused by heart attacks. 
Human trials are scheduled to begin 
in about a year. If these corn pounds 
are shown to work, they may be 
used in other areas where reperfu-
sion injury can be a problem, such 
as in certain types of surgery. 

AZTEC: Advertising Policy Revised 
Continued from page 1 

The new policy, which was ap-
proved by the PAB by a vote of 6-
3 Wednesday, states that adverti -
ing may not serve "primarily to 
oppress the legal rightsofacenain 
group." Because abortion is legal , 
the paper is now free to accept 
abortion ads, 

Petersen said he was "disap-
pointed" with the new policy, but 
accepted it. 

He added that P AB decided that 
the Daily Aztec advertising policy 
committee will meet later this aca-
demic year to review the paper's 
policy to accept phone sex and re-
search paper service ads. How-

ever, Petersen said he does not 
expect the paper's advertising 
policy to change. 

City Editor Adrian Vore said 
most Daily Aztec staffers have been 
apathetic concerning the abortion 
ad controversy. 

"There was no reaction [to the 
new ad policy) .. . The few good 
writers are just concerned about 
turning their stories in," he said. 

In regard to the new ad policy, 
Womancare spokesperson Julie 
Ulrich said, "We're happy about 
it, and we ' re going to put o]Jr ads 
back in the paper."

Fighting Words 

A Disgraceful Policy 
The ulliversity is the ollly illstitutioll ill Westem society whose 

business it is to searchfor and trallsmit the truth regardless of all 
competing or cOIlf/ictiflg pressures and demands; pressures for 
immediate IIsefulness.jor social approval,pressures to serve the 
special interests of government, a class, a professional group, a 
race, afaith, even a nation. 

- Henry Steele Commager 

The new UC policy against "fighting words" is a disgrace. UC 
President David P. Gardner has instituted a policy defining 
figh ting words as those which are "inherently likely to provoke 
a violent reaction whether or not they actually do so." The 
penalty for using fighting words can be as severe as dismissal 
from the University. 

Gardner attempts to clarify this policy by adding that "such 
words include, but are not limited to, those terms widely recog-
nized to be derogatory reference to race, ethnicity, religion, sex, 
sexual orientation, disability and other personal characteristics," 
This only serves to muddy the waters further, however. 

This policy necessitates tremendously subjective judgements 
by campus administrators. Just what are "fighting words"? What 
constitutes insensitivity? People from different ideologies would 
define fighting words very differently. Jack Kemp and Ted 
Kennedy would obviously differ strongly on whether a particular 
expression would be considered "fighting words," or would fall 
into that vague category of "insensitivity." 

Would burning a flag and screaming anti-American slogans in 
the Price Center plaza be acceptable? This would certainly be 
likely to "provoke a violent reaction," so it seems that the UC's 
definition of what constitutes free expression is much narrower 
than that of some conservatives on the Supreme Court. 

A column in the Los Angeles Times pointed out that the "heavy 
stuff: hazing, threats, prolonged harassment, physical intimida-
tion" is already covered by the student conduct code and local , 
state and federal laws. 

Last year in the Guardiall, there were several letters which 
argued that affirmative action is reverse racism, and is thus 
wrong. These letters provoked violent reactions, including letters 
accusing the writers of being Nazis. If the letters were written 
with this new policy in effect, the writers could face punishments 
as severe as expulsion from the University, 

Is this what we really want? The book University in Motion, a 
loving look at UCSD from Oceanids, the UCSD campus women' s 
organization, quotes former Supreme Court Justice Louis 
Brandeis 's definition of a university as "truly a seat of learning 
where research is pursued, books written, and the creative in-
stinct aroused, encouraged and developed in its faculty and 
students." 

But if the merits of a policy such as affirmative action cannot 
be freely debated at a university , where should it be debated? 
Universities should not be reactionary -- instead, they should 
serve as the wellspring of new viewpoints and ideas. 

There's no question some of the activities this policy is trying 
to stop - such as racist, anti-semitic or sexist harrasment - are 
reprehensible, But a university must be committed to the ideal of 
free expression, of the free interchange of competing ideas, Some 
of these ideas will be offensive, but it is a truism that protection 
of free speech exists to defend offensive ideas, because non-of-
fensive expression does not need protection. Supressing ideas 
which encourage offensive behavior may seem defensible, but 
the inevitable effect will be an atmosphere where good ideas are 
not expressed because of the fear of disiplinary action . 

Those who believe in the ideal of a university as a marketplace 
of ideas should consider this new policy much more horrifying 
than any expression the policy is designed to suppress. 

LETTERS 
Greeks Are Elitist Pigs 
Editor: 

This letter is in regards to the 
"Close-up" in the Oct. 2 Guard-
ian. 

Are you kidding, or what? Do 
you think that omeone JUSt said, 
"Hey, let's pretend that frat boys 
are bigoted, chauvanistic, small 
minded adolescents, and every-
one will believe us"? 

If this were the case, you good 
ole boys would have had plenty of 
opportunities to redeem your not 
o honorable image. Stereotypes 

don't just start themselves. 
Fraternities and other grandfa-

loons fragment campuses into 

cliques and castes. They detract 
from the diversity, individuality 
and maturity of the student body, 
and attempt to substitute Greek 
values such as homogeneity, elit-
ism and inebriation. 

If you're going to be elitist pigs, 
then be proud about it and wave 
your snotty noses about, but don't 
pretend you're a bunch of non-
sexist humanitarians, philanthro-
pists and philosophers. 

At least have the balls to say

expect that no one will notice a 
double standard.

Dangerous Censorship 
Editor: 

I was deeply dismayed after 
reading about the new amendment 
to the UC Student Conduct Policy 
regarding "fighting words" in 
which it state that a student may 
be subject to disciplinary actions 
for uttering, "Such words [which] 
include, but are not limited to, 
those widely recognized to be 
derogatory references to race, eth-
nicity , reI igio!l, sex, sexual orien-
tation, disability and other per-
sonal characteristics." 

I have just returned from a year 
abroad and am a bit upset (no, 
pissed oft) to find the national 
trend in this country sweeping 
towards a paranoid insecurity and 
a passive acceptance of censor-
ship. 

I read in foreign newspapers 
how the U.S. Supreme Court had 
modified Roe vs. Wade, rolled 
back the timetables for blacks and 
other minorities in civil rights 
issues, and I returned just in time 
to hear about the NEA (National 
Endowment for the Arts) uproar 
and the " if you bum the flag you 
are not patriotic" issue. 

BENSON 

Now I get back to campus and 
during the first meeting of one of 
my short fiction courses, the pro-
fessor tells us that we may not 
write anything racist, biased or 
sexist. I believe that, indeed, all 
those "ists" are not good and that 
I would not propose any ideas 
propagating that, but to say that 
one may not write about them is 
just plain wrong (all Bill of Rights 
amendments aside). 

And then one week later to 
read that if I call someone an 
"asshole" (or possibly just by 
writing it here) and then that per-
son attacks me, I may now be 
kicked out of the university. Or if 
someone is offended and attacks 
me for uttering the words "Chris-
tian" or even "four eyes," I could 
also be subject to disciplinary 
action. 

I know it may be a little diffi-
cult to take this all seriously, and I 
do believe there are much more 
pressing issues to be addressed 
than who's calling who names, 
but unfortunately our administra-
tion has decided to spend o!.lr 
money on this. Any law, rule or

-in Story 
f;ditor: 

I was most disturbed by 
the inaccuracies in the ar-
tide entitled "A.S. Allocates 
Money For Sexual A ware-
ness Week" in the Oct 5 is-
sue of the Guardian. It 
would appear that the two 
most imponant "facts" of 
the article were wrong. 

The author of the bill is 
Kathy Oh. not Kathy Ho, 
and the total amount of 

moneyallocatedwas$l~ 
not $1,570. Additionally, 
the anicJe contained a fairly 
substantial misqoute. AJ-
though I am confident tbat 
these mistakes were not 
intentional, I sincerely hope 
that the Guardian is more 
responsible in the future.

statute must be logically fonned 
and defined. Maybe if the admini-
stration, or anyone else for that 
matter, could please define for me 
the parameters of "other personal 
characteristics" or"widely recog-
nized" I would be very thankful. 

It is scary to hear about na-
tional statistics which indicate that 
racism is on the rise once again 
(some even saying that it never 
even went away), but taping 
someone's mouth closed or tying 
their hands behind their backs does 
not solve the problem or change 
the person's mind. Only through 
individual negative response and 
education will someone change 
theirviews. Censorship, especially 
at the university, is a dangerous 
step in the wrong direction.

Monday, October 9,1989 The UCSD Guardian OPINION 5 

The First Father: Living in TV Land With George Bush 
considered the extended family of Ameri-
can politics. 

For instance, Dwight Eisenhower could 
be our grandfather, a bit long in the tooth 
now, but much re-

a fatherout of a very specific time and place 
in our culture. 

He' s the father from the American TV 
universe of the late 19505 and early 196Os, 

a father who moved 

tures of Ozzie and Harriet"). He 's clearly 
well-intentioned, loves his kids, has no 
particu larpassion orcommitment to a cause 
or a battle, but simply means to get through 
life with as little disruption as possible. 

NEW YORK - For me, understanding 
politics comes down to basics. Elaborate 
theories about public opinion and endlessly 
detailed polling surveys about why people 
think what they think, are just not as useful 
to me as more commonplace tools of under-
standing. 

vered by our parents 
and aunts and uncles 
for the glorious 
dc:eds he did before 

Jeff Greenfield somewhere between the well-meaning 
fumbling of Stu Er-

Those dads never dealt with the world 
oUl~ide of the Sycamore Street home. The 
big is ues were whether Rick would sum-
mon up his courage to ask the girl to the 
prom, whether Chip would get an allow-
ance, whether Kitten felt jealQUs because 
everybody was proud of the way Bud had 
souped up that old jalopy. 

For example, I don't rely on surveys to 
tell me that Vice President Dan is still strug-
gling to establish his reputation as a serious 
figure. I simply note that Jay Leno, David 
Lettennan and Johnny Carson still use him 
as a semi-official punchline in their jokes. 

Universal Press Syndicate 

we were born. 
John Kennedy would be our older 

brother, the romantic figure who taught us 

win ("Life With Fa-
ther") and Chester A. 

Riley ("The Life of Riley") to the compe-
tent, easygoing certainties of Jim Anderson 

And even the CBS sit-com "Murphy 
Brown" features a Quayle joke of the week. 

"I was a day late on the Quayle nomina-
tion," the bartender admits to Murphy 
Brown, "but I attribute that to a case of 
psychological denial." 

When the jokesters, with their incredi-
bly well-tuned antennae, start to layoff 
Quayle, then you'll know he's made it. 

I don't rely on attitudinal surveys to 
figure out whether big business may be in 
for another round as one of America's fa-
vorite villains. 

"Bush seems a cross between Fred 
MacMurray ('My Three Sons') and 
Ozzie Nelson {'The Adventures of 
Ozzie and Harriet')... Those dads 
never dealt with the world outside of 
the Sycamore Street home." 

Sure reminds me of Washington today, 
where the most notable reality is the com-
plete, utter absence of any real political 
passion, where flag-burning has to be 
brought out of the American attic as a real 
concern, even though nobody ' burned a 
flag for years. 

It's the perfect time for a First Father, 
who will not so much lead as preside, with 
a reassuring personality. asometimes goofy 
way with words, but with an undeniable 
sense of decency. 

What catches my attention is a recent 
issue of a "Supennan" comic. There I find 
that Lex Luthor, longtime mad scientist-
nemesis of Superman, has become: a cor-
porate raider, taking over research compa-
nies, the better to discover means of crip-
pling the Man of Steel. 

And when I look at how presidents 
connect with the American people, I try 
very hard to figure out how they fit into the 
American family-literally. That is, I try to 
see what role they play in what might be 

how to tune a carburetor, throw a football, 
catch a fish. The cheerleaders from high 
school were always nice to us, hoping we' d 
introduce them to Jack. 

Ronald Reagan was our favorite uncle, a 
man who'd come in from the road with a 
new joke, a toy for the kids, and a way of 
spinning tales that had us mesmerized, And 
if some of the tales were stretched, well, 
who really cared? 

So who is George Bush? I think now I 
know. George Bush is the First Father, but

6 OPINION 

A Casualty of Academia 
Editor: 

One can easily say congratula-
tions to Bard-Alan Finlan. The 
University has evolved into a huge 
lumbering animal of bureaucratic 
lethargy. Nick Aguilar is one of 
the most prime and shining ex-
amples . Depending on your 
circumstance and Nick ' s involve-
ment, Aguilar is either totally in 
the way or cannot get out of the 
way fast enough. 

My own experience is that I 
went to school with Nick- I know 
him better than most. One of 
Nick ' s best tricks is to put his tail 
between his legs and hide in his 
office. I got involved in a serious 
dispute with Hugh Mehan and the 
Teacher Education Program (TEP) 
about five years ago. While Nick 
knew and subsequently said to me 
that Mehan was very much out of 
bounds in his legal maneuvering, 

Nick didn ' t do a damn thing. 
At best, he stood behind all and 

any of the regulations that cov-
ered his butt. He absolutely did 
nothing (!) to help the student' s 
interest. He was too busy dancing 
through the Policy and PlOcedure 
Manual to address the lousy deal 
I got atTEP. 

The crime is that if we ap-
proached our responsibilities like 
Nick and Joe do, we'd be in jail. 
The place up here on the mesa is 
too big now. Not enough indians 
and too many chiefs- the adage 
applies. 

Nick is a caring, sensitive man 
deep in his soul. The vicious trag-
edy is that if you stay tangled up 
long enough in thi s academic 
madness and lose touch with the 
realness of the world-at-Iarge you 
evolve into a full-blown asshole.

A Short 'Career as a Second-hand Poacher 
8y CATHERINE DILLE, News EdiJor 

Some of the most graphic and disturbing media 
images to enter American homes this summer v ia the 
six o'clock news were the pictures of dead and dying 
elephants and footage ofthe Kenyan police destroy-
ing thousands of tons of illegally poached African 
ivory. 1be millions of Americans who watch the 
evening news over dinner were suddenly face to face 
with the gory origins of their piano keys and cameo 
necklaces. 

Illegally poached ivory became the cause celebre 
of Jimmy Stewart as well as the United States Con-
gress which, with amazing speed for the lumbering 
bureaucracy that it is, enacted laws forbidding im-

beads with the hand-carved Netsuke are from . .. " 
I know they say ajob is ajob, but I really felt bad 

about pushing the ivory. I just sort of mumbled that 
part of the sales pitch. But every time I did, some 
lady would ask what the white beads were made of 
that would go perfect with the sweater she just 
bought. And when [ told her, she would inevitably 
look at me as though [ had slaughtered the elephant 
myself and say "Oh no, I wouldn ' t care to look at 
those, [think it's just sick what they are doing to the 
elephants." 

I thought it was sick too, even though the ivory 
thall was sell i ng was from Asia and had already been 
in the country when the trade moratori urn was passed.

CAMPUS: UC Closer To 
Deciding On New Locations 
Continued from page 1 

our budget" for research on pro-
posed new campuses. 

The UC Board of Regents also 
considered a set of preliminary 
academic planning guidelines that 
stress a "need for a broad array of 
undergraduate and graduate pro-
grams to the doctoral level in the 
letters, arts, sciences" and research 
programs. 

"In contrast to the site guide-
lines, the academic rules will not 
be of immediate imponance in 
choosing a location, Malaspina 
said. 

"Right now they only have 
general application," he said. 
"They're only general lines of 
thinking that you'd want to apply 
to a campus anywhere. 

It could influence the location 
of a campus and what that campus 
becomes," Malaspina said. "I think 
we'll see that when the list of 50 to 
60 is narrowed down." 

Bechtel is researching possible 
sites regardless of municipal pro-
posals, Malaspina said. 

"We've asked areas ofthe state 
not to submit formal site proposals 
because that would be costly and 
time consuming and might raise 
expectations," he said. 

Despite the University's pro-
fessed lack of interest, several cit-
ies have submitted "letters of in-
terest" or similar items to the Re-
gents. 

"We sent many things, includ-
ing a very comprehensive video on 
Redding" as a locale for post-sec-
ondary education, said Lou Ger-
ard, executive of Ihe Redding 
Chamber of Commerce. 

By June of this year the Regents 
had already received about 30 let-
ters of interest, according to Ter-
esa LaRocca, economic develop-
ment specialist for Palm Springs, 
which hopes to be a site candidate. 

Gerard said that many cities had 
openly expressed interest in a new 
campus, including Eureka, Santa 
Rosa, Marysville, Ukiah and 
Yreka. 

LaRocca and Gerard said their 
cities would be likely to donate 
land in the event that they were 
chosen. 

"We would cenainly be look-
ing for sites of potential donation," 
LaRocca said. 

Gerard would not guarantee that 
Redding would donate land to the 
University, but he said that the city 
would follow historical practice. 

"Historically, the University 
generally has been presented with 
land. One might say we are a site-
rich area," he said. 

The informal competition be-
tween cities is not groundless. 
Public suppon, including expres-
sions of suppon by local govern-
ments and civic groups, is one of 
the preliminary site criteria that 
will be sought by the Regents in 
late May.

A Night in the Life of a Campus Police Officer 
By RENEE LEWIS 
Contriblltinll Writer 

You may not know this, but 
there is a team of dedicated profes-
sionals on campu who are ac-
tively working to ensure the safety 
of all students at UCSD. They are 
the members of the University of 
California Police Department 
(UCPD). 

Wanting to get a bener idea of 
what an officer's job entails,l spent 
about four and a half hours riding 
along with UC Police Officer Jeff 
Cox last Wednesday nigh!. 

Looking around the inrerior of 
the patrol car. I felt a bit apprehen-
sive at first, e pecially when I 
noticed the large shotgun in its 
stand right next to me. Officer Cox 
assured me, however. that so far he 
has never had to use it and, to the 
best of his knowledge, there has 
never been a shoot-out on campus 
in the history of UCSD. 

We started out the evening by 
patrolling the campus and the area 
by the glider port. Officer Cox, I 
learned, has been on the campus 
police force for three months and 
was a member of the San Diego 
Police Department before that. I 
also discovered that he is a part-
time student here at UCSD. Cox 
was a full-t ime student a[ Revelle 
College in 1980 for about three 
years. He returned to school a year 

ago to finish up his degree in politi-
cal science and has only two classes 
left before he accomplishe thm 
goal. 

According to Cox, the campus 
police department is composed of 
one chief, one lieutenant, five ser-

As a UC police 
officer, ' You do 
something different 
everyday_ Everyday 
you don't know 
exactly what's going 
to come up. That 
aspect of [the job] is 
kind of challenging. ' 

Officer Jeff Cox 
geants and roughly twenty pol ice 
officers. In addition, he said, "there 
[are] a number ofCSO's [Commu-
nity Service Officers) and they 
provide the escorts. (They] are all 
students here at UCSD. Each dorm 
area has a ecurity guard that works 
there at night and ... gets off at 
3:00 a.m. There are [also] parking 
reps that work during the night ... 
and the day." 

To become an officer of the 
UCPD, a person must be a gradu-
ate of a police academy in Califor-
nia. Most of the police officers at 

UCSD, said Cox, have also had a 
great deal of experience prior to 
coming here, either on the San 
DiegoPoliceDepartment (SDPD), 
in the Sheriffs Department. or in 
another local police department. 

Cox. who is on duty from 3:00 
p.m. until 11:00 p.m., said that his 
jobas a UC police officer entails "a 
whole spectrum of police duties," 
such as answering radio calls from 
burglar alanns, controlling loud 
parties and domestic disturbances, 
getting medical attention for in-
jured students and patrolling cam-
pus both by car and on foot. 

Occasionally, the officers are 
assigned to special details as well. 
Earlier that day, for example, Cox 
and his co-workers were called on 
to "maintain the perimeter" of the 
Institute of the Americas while 
Costa Rican President and Nobel 
Prize Laureate Oscar Arias was 
being presented wi th the Institute's 
Award for Democracy and Peace. 

While many of the responsibili-
ties are the same, Officer Cox said 
that the SDPD and UCPD have 
very different atmosphere . 

"Here we aren '[ as concerned 
with making a lot of arrests. In-
stead of making an arrest we might 
refer [the offender) to thei r provost 
.... Everything here doesn' t have 
to be from an enforcement stand-
point," Cox explained.

La Jolla Playhouse Presents 
Award-winning Productions 
By MARK BUB lEN 
COllIribllling Writer 

Many students pass the La Jolla 
Playhouse daily as they drive to 
school along La Jolla Village Drive. 
A theater with high goals,the Play-
house is more than another land-
mark. 

The La Jolla Playhouse was 
originally fonned in 1941 by Gre-
gory Peck, Dorothy McGuire and 
Mel Ferrer. The board of directors 
suspended operation of the theater 
from 1964to 1983 while it planned 
the theater's future. In 1983, it 
reopened at UCSD with the goal 
of establishi ng a world class thea-
ter operation. 

The Playhouse is not without its 
share of acclaim. Since 1983, it 
has received 125 awards. In addi-
tion, Broadway productions of 
plays which were premiered on the 
UCSD campus by the Playhouse 
have received some of the country's 
most prestigious awards. 

Big River, a 1984 musical about 
Huckleberry Finn with its score 
written by Roger Miller, received 
seven Tony awards in 1985. These 
included a best director award for 
Des McAnuff, the art director for 
the Playhouse. 

Another example is A Walk ill 
the Woods, a 1987 Playhouse

production abou t Soviet and 
American nuclear arms reduction 
talks, which won the American 
TheaterCritics A ward for best new 
play in 1988. It was also nomi-
nated for a Pulitzer prize that same 
year. 

Even though the La Jolla Play-
house produces award-winning 
plays, it is suffering fi nancial dif-
ficuitie , according to a spokes-

person who spoke under the condi-
tion of anonymity. 

The Playhouse has a season of 
only 32 weeks, but incurs over-
head costs throughout the year-
overhead which the season 's earn-
ings do not fully cover. 

The limi ted season is due to the 
Pl ayhouse sharing the Mandell 
Weiss Center for Perform ing Arts 

See THEATERS, page 13 

Gall JohnsonlGllardian 
UC police officer Jeff Cox is also a part-time student at UCSD. 

said that he likes having time to 
talk with people on campus, in-
stead of "just bouncing from one 
radio call to the next." At UCSD, 
he also gets a chance to do more 
service-oriented jobs than he did 
on the SDPD, such as letting pro-
fessors into their offices when they 
lock themselves out. 

Cox also pointed out several 
other aspects of his job that he 
finds particularly enjoyable. 

"One ... nice thing [about the 
job]," he said, "is that you gettodo 
a lot of foot patrol, ... just cruise 
around and check things out. They 
actually encourage that here . 
You're not trapped in your patrol 
car." 

Another, continued Cox, is "that 
you do something different every 
day. Every day you don't know 
exactly what's going to come up. 
That aspect of it is kind of chal-
lenging." 

The UC Police Department 's 
jurisdiction encompasses every-
thing within a one-mile radius of 
the campus, including the Scripps 
Institute of Oceanography , and the 
La 1011 a del Sol and Mesa Apart-
ments. While patrolling this prop-
erty, we were called to a code 1154 
at the south entrance of building 
301 in the Matthews complex. I 
wondered, at hearing such impres-
si ve-sounding numbers, if! should 
be worried for my safety. I soon 
learned, however, that in this case, 
an 1154 meant that a man had 
locked himself out of his office in 
the Universi ty Public Relations 
building and we had to let him in. 

After assisting the man, Cox 
entered what had occurred into his 

Officer's Daily Activity Report, in 
which he is, literally, required by 
the Department to account forevery 
minute he spends on duty. 

At about 8:45 p.m., we were 
called to back up another unit allhe 
Undergraduate Library. Librarians 
had called in a complaint that a 
man was talking to himself and 
disturbing students around him. 
After arriving at the scene, I ob-
served while Cox and anotheroffi-
cerescorted the man from the build-
ing. Upon questioning him, the 
officers discovered that he was a 
registered sex offender who had 
been in trouble with the UC Police 
before. 

A field interview report was 
then filled out which stated that the 
man, who had no legitimate busi-
ness at UCSD, was required by law 
to remain off campus for 72 hours. 
If he returned before then, he would 
be in violation of the penal code 
and subject to arrest. 

Along with several other units, 
we were then called to respond to 
an accident on Lebon Drive in front 
of the La 10lla del Sol apartment 
complex. 1 held on tightly to the 
arm rest as we sped to the scene, 
lights flashing and siren scream-
ing. A woman, who had been driv-
ing on the wrong side of the slreet, 
had collided head-on with another 
car, leaving its driver injured. 
Fortunately , the man was conscious 
and the injury, though painful, was 
not serious. Isat in the police car to 
block Iraffic, while Cox inter-
viewed witnesses and waited for 
medical help to arrive. 

We spent the remainder of lhe

evening patrolling UCSD and 
pulling over an occasional cam-
pus traffic violator. Cox said that 
expired registrations, broken tail 
lights, and other minor violations 
give officers probable cause to 
stop someone who, in their opin-
ion, looks suspicious_ 

Having heard all the stories in 
the news about pol ice officers who 
are shot or killed during routine 
traffic stops, I felt a certain degree 
of anxiety each time we pulled 
someone over. 

Cox said that. while he is 

always aware that something like 
that could happen, hedoesn '[ spend 
his time worrying about it. For that 
reason, however, explained Cox, a 
second officer always comes to 
cover the one making the stop. If 
an officer is not comfortable about 
the people helshe has stopped. hel 
she can wait for the second officer 
to arrive before approaching them. 

Before we parted ways, Cox 
had some advice for students at 
UCSD. He urged them 10 take 
precautions against crime and not 
to think that nothing can happen to 
them here. "Crime does occur on 
this campus," he said. 

" If [students] are victims of a 
crime or if they see somelhing that

they think is suspicious, they re-
ally should call it in because we 
can get here within just a few 
minutes, generally," Cox contin-
ued. "Then, we can be the judge of 
whether il was silly 10 call il in or 
not. A lotoftimes, something will 
happen, they'll see auspicious 
person, [and], for whatever rea-
son, will decide not to call it in 
until a few hours later. By Ihal 
time, the person is gone." 

During the hours I spenl ob-
serving Cox, I learned many 
things, not the least important of 
which was thaI, cont rary to the 
image portrayed by the media, 
police work is not one dramatic 
event or shoot-out after another.

Theaters 
Continued from page 10 
wilh the UCSD Department of 
Theatre. The Iheatre department 
uses Ihe Center during most of the 
school year, and Ihe Playhouse uses 
it during summer months. 

In order to keep functioning, 
Ihe Playhouse has begun a com-
munity fund raising campaign. 

"To broaden our base of sup-
port, we 've gone public to Ihe 
community to say :We need your 
help, '" the spokesperson said. "We 
have set a goal to raise $500,000 
by December of 1989 in order to 
ensure a 1990 season." 

The current base of support for 
the Playhouse is supplied evenly 
from bolh ticket sales and outside 
donations, the spokesperson ex-
plained. These donations include 
charity from individuals in the 
community as well as granls from 
corporations. 

The UCSD Guardian FEATURES 13 

The shared usage arose from 
the agreemenl between the Uni" 
versi lY and the La 10lla Playhouse 
Board of Directors which estab-
lished the Playhouse's residence 
on campus. According to the 
spokesperson, the Playhouse do-
nated $3.25 million to the Univer" 
sity. and il was detennined by 
UCSD and the Playhouse that Ihe 
facility would be shared by the two 
Iheater groups. 

The Playhouse was recently 
awarded a $250,000 challenge 
grant by the National Endowment 
for the Arts. Over a three-year 
period, the grant produces a Ihree-
to-onedollarmatch: for every three 
dollars earned, the grant donates 
one dollar, up to a maximum of 
$250,000. 

Brian Morris/Guardian 
The Mandell Weiss Center for Performing Arts is used by the UCSD theatre department during the 
school year and the La Jolla Playhouse in the summer. 

The spokesperson noted Ihat 
anolher source of the Playhouse's 
problems is the one-year delay in 
the originally scheduled 1990 
completion of the Weiss Forum, a 
new 4OO-seat theater to be built 
adjacent to the Mandell Weiss 
Center. With the completion of 
this and a planned third theater, the 
Playhouse would have the ability 
to produce plays year-round. 

The Playhouse has also received 
grants from the California Arts 
Council, the city of San Diego, the 
county of San Diego, as well as 
several corporations including 

AT&T and NBC. 
In addition to providing enter" 

tainment, the Playhouse offers 
academic opportunities for students 
of theater. All students seeking a 
Master of Fine Arts degree from 
the UCSD Department of Theatre 
are required to fulfill a ten-week 
residency wilh Ihe La 10lla Play-
house. 

Two Playhouse members also 
si t on the Department of Thealre 
faculty. 

The current production of 
Macbeth, opening for preview 
October 10, is a collaboration be-
tween the Playhouse and the De-
partment of Theater, and includes 
seven student actors, two student 
assistant directors, and one student

Tritons Defeat Whittier; USIU 

Men's Soccer Back on Track 
By JOHN ASUNCION 
Contributing Writer 

The Whittier CQllege Poets 
came to UCSD hoping to write a 
rhyme of victory over the defend-
ing Divi iQn III NatiQnal Cham-
pion TritQn men' occer team. 

But the Poet were not even 
able to pick up their feet - let 
alone their pens - as their defense 
folded in the econd half and wrote 
Qff an easy 6-2 victQry for the 
Triton on Friday afternoon at 

orth Campu Stadium. 
The win wa a weet one for 

UCSD, which had been struggling 
after losing three of its previou 
fQur conte t . Ye terday, the Tri-
tQn won their econd game in a 
rQW with a 1-0 overtime victory 
Qver USIU Qn the rQad. UCSD's 
recQrd is nQW 7-3-2. 

In the Whittier game, the Tri-
tQns did nQt begin to' dQminate 
until the ecQnd half, as they held a 
tight 2-1 lead at halftime. But after 
Chris Hans en and Mike Bradley 
sCQred successive gQals Qnly one 
minute and 41 seconds apart, there 
was little dQubt as to' who was 
gQing to eQntrQI the remainder of 
the game. 

Grq Benes,lGuardian 
Poetry In motion - Brian Bradbury (16) and the men's soccer 
team danced their way to a 6-2 victory over Whittier on Friday. 

Bradley 's gQal came Qn an as-
sist from juniQr Chris JQnes, whO' 
dished out a tQtal of three on the 
afternoon. 

With a 4-1 UCSD lead, Shane 
Sigler's gQal fQr Whittier Qn a di-
rect kick which deflected Qff a de-
fender meant little to the Tritons. 
UCSD responded with two more 
gQals by forwards Carrick Brewster 

and Scott Rommel. Rommel, the 
team leader in goals, sCQred twice 
on the day. 

The four-gQal second half out-
burst by the Tritons was in direct 
CQntrast with their play in the first 
half, where they failed to' convert 
on a number of scoring opportuni-
ties. Still, RQmmel and sopho-
more Mike Alberts managed to

PHIL'S ANAL YSIS .. .1 rarely do this. Rarely. In fact, 
this kills me. But I'm just going to have to go with an L.A. 
team for lack of a better alternative. Actually, I'd much 
rather make another baseball playoff prediction, but it 
would be too late by the time the paper came out. Besides, 
nobody would believe me ifI told them I said Rickey Hen-
derson was going to be the ALeS MYP before the playoffs 
started, so why mention it now? But, oh well, I guess I'll 
resort to another Monday night pick. Why am I going to go 
with an L.A. team? God knows-but maybe it's because 
the Raiders recently hired Art Shell as head coach. Shell 
was a true Oakland Raider - an offensive lineman on a 
team which everybody feared and respected. Maybe he 
can do something with this floundering and pansy-like 
L.A. team which has lost every bit of that ferocious de-
meanor it used to boast up north. Maybe he won't be able 
to improve this team until it returns to Oakland. Who 
knows. But for now, as I grit my teeth, PHIL says ...
