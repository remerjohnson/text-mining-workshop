With the passage of President Barack Obama’s health-care 
reform bill, students at UCSD 
may soon see the cost of their 
school-sponsored health insur-
ance program increase, along 
with an excise tax on tanning 
beds and full insurance sub-
sidies for individuals with no 
income.

The bill  — passed last 
month after more than a year 
of deliberation in Congress — 
allows students to remain on 
their parents’ health-insurance 
plans until they reach the age 
of 26 — a significant increase 
from the previously common 
age limits of 19 or 23. Before 
the bill’s passage, children were 
typically removed from their 
parents’ policies when they 
graduated from high school or 
college.

The provision is designed to 
cover the 1.7 million university 
students — or 20 percent of the 
national student population — 
who are currently uninsured. 

According to Student Health 
Insurance Program Manager 
Cindy McDaniel, allowing stu-
dents to stay on their parents’ 
plan until age 26 will likely raise 
the price of participating in 
UCSD’s health-care program.

McDaniel said that if more 
students are covered by their 
parents’ insurance — students 
who would otherwise have paid 
for basic coverage through the 
campus program — they will 
choose to opt out of S.H.I.P. 
Since the price of the S.H.I.P. 
plan depends on the number of 

students subscribed to the plan, 
an increase in students choos-
ing to opt may lead to higher 
prices overall.

Currently, S.H.I.P. costs 
approximately $282 per quarter 
for undergraduates.  According 
to McDaniel, it is still too early 
to estimate how much the pric-
es would increase. 

“A lot of factors go into 
the cost of student health-care 
plans,” she said. “Of course, the 
number of students enrolled 
will have an impact. It’s still 
too early to tell... but we’re still 
trying to work out a time frame 
[to determine the new rates] 
with our broker and insurance 
carrier.”

For Eleanor Roosevelt 
College freshman Danny 
Fishman, the reform means he 
will likely opt out of the pro-
gram by next fall. Fishman said 
that, had the bill not passed, 
he would have been removed 
from his father’s insurance plan 
when he turned 19, and would 
have subsequently signed up for 
S.H.I.P. However, his plans have 
changed.

“If the price of S.H.I.P. 
increases while I’m still on my 
father’s plan, I’m going to stay 
on my father’s plan — there’s 
no need for me to get S.H.I.P. 
anymore,” he said. 

The reform is particu-
larly beneficial to students like 
Fishman who have undergone 
a medical procedure in the past.

An in-the-works proposal to bring the 
San Diego trolley system to UCSD has 
narrowed down three possible routes, and 
could be completed by 2016, according to 
Director of UCSD Physical and Community 
Planning Brad Werdick. 

The prospect first arose in 2004 when 
San Diego’s Regional Planning Agency sug-
gested extending the current trolley sys-
tem from the Old Town Transit Center to 
the UCSD area, through University Towne 

Jacobs 
Donation 
Funds New 
Hospital

By Connie Qian
Staff Writer

Following a $75 million donation 
from Irwin and Joan Jacobs UCSD 
Health System, which oversees all 
UCSD hospitals,  has announced plans 
to build the Jacobs Medical Center, 
which will take over some responsibili-
ties from the UCSD Medical Center in 
Hillcrest.

Critics from Scripps Medical 
Center in La Jolla argue that the new 
facility will have adverse effects on 
the Hillcrest location, which currently 
offers services such as advanced sur-
gery and women’s care to many under-
privileged San Diego residents. These 
services would move to the new center.

“Moving health-care services from 
an underserved community will cre-
ate a ripple effect with all providers in 
the region,” Scripps Health President 
and CEO Chris Van Gorder said. 
“If UCSD provides fewer services in 
Hillcrest, the other providers   — such 
as Scripps — will be responsible for a 
larger share of the underserved com-
munities.”

According to UCSD Health 
System spokeswoman Kimberly 
Edwards, however, these are not valid 
concerns. She maintains that the 
“two-campus strategy” will actually 
improve patient care in San Diego.

“Surgery and women’s interests 
will be moving [to the Jacobs Medical 
Center], but everything else stays — 
trauma, emergency, AIDS/HIV, inpa-
tient, outpatient,” Edwards said. “In 
fact, bed for bed, we’re going to have 
more room for people down here. So 
the complaints that are coming from 
Scripps are not right at all.”

According to Edwards, decreas-
ing the number of beds from 321 
to 300 is still more than enough to 
house the average 255 patients in the 
hospital daily, and removing services 
will increase the number of private 
patient rooms.

“The only service leaving Hillcrest 
[completely] is baby delivery,” 
Edwards said. “And that won’t hap-
pen for another six years.”

One of the main focuses of the 
new medical center — which will 
also house the Hospital for Advanced 
Surgery and the Hospital for Women 
and Infants  — will be the Cancer 
Hospital, devoted to addressing the 
needs of patients afflicted with the No. 
1 cause of death in San Diego County.

Of the predicted $664 million 
required for completion, the Jacobs 
Medical Center received $350 mil-
lion from external sources — such as 
state bonds, reserves and capitalized 
leases — and $131 million from char-
ity donors. 

“We are extremely pleased to 
support this state-of-the-art medi-
cal center, which will provide both 
outstanding care for patients as well 
as resources for UC San Diego phy-
sicians, researchers and their col-
leagues across the La Jolla Mesa to 
rapidly translate medical research 
into improved health,” Irwin Jacobs 
said in a press release.

Jacobs — who also financed the 
Jacobs School of Engineering — served 
as a professor of computer science 

and engineering at UCSD from 1966 
to 1972, and founded Fortune 500 
company Qualcomm Incorporated in 
1985. In 2003, he and his wife donat-
ed $110 million to the Jacobs School 
of Engineering.

“This will be the largest gift 
ever given to UC San Diego Health 
Sciences, and it is nearly impossible 
to express the depth of our gratitude,” 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox said in 
a statement.

The new medical center will cover 
490,000 square feet, and will stand 
10 stories high. Construction is set 
to begin in 2012 and the hospital’s 
doors will be opened for patient care 
in December 2016.

Center, Old Town and downtown 
San Diego. 

Since then, SANDAG has been 
mapping the area to determine an 
optimal route for the extension. 

The SANDAG Transportation 
Committee will make an official pre-
sentation to the its board of directors 
on April 16, who will then vote on 
which routes they would want to pur-
sue. During a 30-day scoping period 
May 3 through June 1, 2010, the 
public will be able to give feedback 
on the routes.

The project would extend either 
the trolley or a light-rail transit ser-
vice 11 miles north of its starting 
point at the Old Town Transit Center 
to one of three proposed stations at 
Tecolote Road, Clairemont Drive or 
Balboa Avenue. 

The extension would run north 
to UCSD along I-5 from Gilman 
Drive, and then follow Voigt Drive 
and Genesee Avenue to a final station 
at UTC. 

Other  alternatives are also  being 
explored. 

According to SANDAG spokes-
woman Anne Steinberger, one pos-
sible route from Voigt Drive to UTC 
is along Regents Road and Executive 
Drive; another possibility is along 
Genesee Avenue. 

Stations have also been proposed 

at University Center Lane, UCSD 
West, UCSD East, Executive Drive 
and the UTC Transit Center are all 
proposed stations.

Werdick said the project has the 
potential to improve public-trans-
portation services and reduce traffic 
congestion. 

“Students, staff and faculty are 
hesitant to take buses — and frankly, 
a lot of the routes coming to cam-
pus are not the most direct routes,” 
Werdick said. “The trolley would 
open up a new alternative transporta-
tion method on campus which [is] 
going to be a lot more attractive.”

San Diego’s trolley line, called the 
Mid-Coast Corridor Project, was  
first suggested in 1987 and then offi-
cially created when San Diego voters 
residents voted in November 2004 to 
include the initiative in an existing 
half-cent transportation tax called 
TransNet. 

“The region has set this as a trans-
portation priority,” Steinberger said. 

TransNet, implemented in 1988, 
will fund 50 percent of the project’s 
estimated $1.2 billion cost. 

According to its Web site, 
SANDAG officials believe that the 
Federal Transit Administration’s New 
Starts program — which funds fixed 
guideway systems such as light-rail 
systems — will fund the remaining 
50 percent.

According to Assistant Vice 
Chancellor of UCSD Strategic 
Campus Resource Initiatives Brian 
Gregory, the trolley system would 
reduce the number of cars on cam-
pus emissions and the need to build 
expensive parking structures. 

He added that the trolley would 
allow students to travel to and from 
campus, and to other areas, more 
conveniently.

“It will benefit UCSD because it 
will give us options for the UCSD 
community to get to the campus, and 
then to go [to] other places from the 
campus,” Gregory said. 

Muir College sophomore Amber 
Elsaad said she would not benefit 
from the trolley. 

“I probably wouldn’t use it,” 
Elsaad said. “I’ve tried taking the bus 
downtown, and public transportation 
just takes too long.”

If the recommendations are 
approved, SANDAG will hold a con-
ference at UCSD to gather feedback 
on possible routes.

“UCSD has the opportunity to be 
very involved in this and contribute 
to expanding transit to the UCSD 
campus,” Steinberger said.

Ticket pricing for the route has 
not yet been set.

Cigarette advertisement embel-
lished with flashy pink packaging 
may seem frivolous, but a recent 
UCSD study revealed that these 
campaigns illegally target impres-
sionable adolescent girls, despite a 
1994 industry agreement to disci-
pline such practices.

“Cigarette ads have a powerful 
effect on children’s curiosity,” UCSD 
Cancer Prevention and Control 
Program Director John P. Pierce 
said. “Curiosity is a powerful drive 
that is more likely to lead to experi-
mentation.” 

In 1998, four of the largest 
U.S. cigarette companies, includ-
ing Phillip Morris USA, Lorillard 
Tobacco Company and Camel man-
ufacturer R.J. Reynolds Tobacco 

Company, signed an agreement 
with the California State Attorney 
General to stop targeting youth, in 
response to studies showing that 
teens are more highly receptive to 
advertising.

However, statistics gathered 
from a five-year telephone survey 
study suggests that even after this 
agreement, teens exposed to a 2007 
Camel No. 9 ad were more likely to 
use cigarettes. The Moores Cancer 
Center polled 1,036 male and female 
adolescents from 2003 to 2008 about 
their experiences with smoking in 
order to gauge the effect of adver-
tisements. Participants were asked 
whether they had a “favorite ad.” 

According to Pierce, although 
the percentage of boys with a 
favorite cigarette advertisement 
remained stable over the five years, 
the number of girls who had a 
favorite advertisement showed a 
significant jump after the fifth sur-
vey, which occurred immediately 
after the Camel’s release of the No. 
9 ad. 

In the fifth survey, 21 percent 
of female participants claimed they 

had a favorite advertisement — a 
significant increase from the previ-
ous year’s report of 10 to 13 percent. 
Overall, 44 percent of girls named 
a favorite advertisement during the 
fifth survey, compared to 31 to 33 
percent in the first four years. Pierce 
attributed this spike to the No. 9 
campaign that targeted young girls. 

“Previous studies show that these 
girls who identify with a favorite ad 
are at a 50 percent increased risk to 
start smoking in the future,” Pierce 
said. 

Congressional leaders have com-
plained that Reynolds’ campaign 
violates the agreement, he added.

For the No. 9 campaign, Camel 
placed the advertisements in maga-
zines such as Vogue and Glamour, 
where ads often appear as fashion 
spreads designed to entice women 
with giveaway prizes such as lip 
balms, cell phones and purses.

“We identified that the jump in 
2007 was due to the Camel No. 9 
campaign that was specifically tar-
geted [toward] girls,” Pierce said. 
“And this shows they are still doing 
something they agreed not to do in 

the MSA.” 
R.J. Reynolds responded to the 

criticism by announcing that the 
company would discontinue print 
No. 9 advertising, but would contin-
ue to sponsor the campaign through 
internet advertising and in stores 
that carry the brand.

NEWS� THURSDAY, APRIL 08, 2010� THE UCSD GUARDIAN 3 

ficult time securing independent health 
insurance under the old system. 

“I had a medical procedure done 
two years ago,” he said. “If I tried to 
apply to Kaiser as an independent — 
because of that prior medical history 
— I wouldn’t be accepted.”

The bill prohibited that anyone 
under 26 be denied coverage due to 
pre-existing conditions. In addition,  
a provision will go into effect on 
September 23, 2010, that prohibits 
insurance companies from dropping 
customers from their plan when 
they become sick.

According to Congressman Bob 
Filner (D-San Diego), who spoke at 
UCSD on April 6, the bill will also 
empower students whose parents do 
not have health insurance by mak-
ing them a large demographic health 
care companies will listen to.

“If you’re a student and your par-
ents don’t have an insurance plan, 
in a few years, you’ll be able to join 
a pool of uninsured people — and 
that gives you leverage as if you were 
a part of a big company,” Filner said. 

He added that the “leverage” 
would make it more likely that major 
insurance companies offer lower 
rates.

Filner also said the health-care 

reform will provide students — and 
the general population — with a 
government subsidy, based 
on a person’s income.

“If you have zero 
income, you’ll get almost 
100-percent subsidy,” 
Filner said.

When the bill goes into 
full effect in 2014, every 
American will be required 
to purchase a minimum 
health-insurance package, 
and will be fined anywhere 
from $750 to $1,000 if they 
do not comply. 

In 2014, individu-
als with income levels at 
133 percent of the pov-
erty line — approximately 
$15,000— will be eligible 
for Medicaid, a govern-
ment program providing 
health insurance for low-
income families. In 2009, 
the average starting salary 
for new college graduates 
was $48,515.

Marshall College freshman 
Tiffany Lee said the threshold for 
government subsidies is too high.

“I’ve worked a minimum wage 
job as a waitress, and it wasn’t a lot 
of money,” Lee said. “Even with tips, 

you still lose a lot of your salary to 
taxes, and that would be hard to live 

off of. The bar for govern-
ment-supplied insurance 
should be higher, since 
so many people make so 
little money.”

Effective July 2011, the 
health-care bill includes 
provisions that will create 
a 10-percent excise tax on 
the use of indoor tanning 
beds.

Muir College freshman 
Julie Luu said the excise 
tax was a good idea.

“Tanning beds are a 
luxury,” Luu said. “Every 
little penny [to fund the 
health care bill] helps, 
so it’s probably a good 
idea because health care 
reform needs a lot of help 
and it’s a good start.” The 
bill also allows those who 
receive federal subsidies 
for health insurance to 
purchase abortion cover-

age for a surcharge.

I t’s election season, and that means a strange — for lack of a better word — A.S. Council meeting.
At least two hours were spent in a 

state of confusion: first, over a Students 
for Justice in Palestine event, and 
second, over judicial board members’ 
availability for the A.S. elections.

Three students in costume — two 
in suits and shades, and one in an 
orange jumpsuit 
with a black bag 
over his head — 
addressed council-
members during 
public input on 
their recruit-
ments for C.I.A. 
(Criminally Insane Assholes).

Leaders from the UCSD ZOR 
dance team pleaded the council to help 
fund their trip to Boston, so they could 
attend nationals for the first time.

After much debate over the ethics 
of allocating funds for travel — some-
thing the council typically doesn’t do 
for student organizations — council-
members voted to fund the full $7,600 
it would take for 18 ZOR team mem-
bers to attend the competition.

During member reports, talkative 
presidential candidate Tanvir Dhillon 
announced his appearance in next 
Tuesday’s Mr. Alpha Chi beauty pag-
eant, where he would represent the 
A.S. Council.

AVP Concerts & Events Alex 
Bramwell said Friday’s Bear Garden 
will be moved to RIMAC Field in an 
attempt to boost attendance at the 
men’s volleyball game afterward.

During the question period, 
Campuswide Senator Carli Thomas 
asked a pertinent question: “Where is 
Utsav Gupta?”

[Editor’s note: He was at Foodworx, 
campaigning.]

In fact, only 17 voting members 
attended the meeting — just one more 

than needed for quorum.
After a funding request from 

Students for Justice in Palestine 
for a hip-hop activism event and a 
“Writings on the Wall” event, an hour 
of debate ensued over the criteria for 
content-neutral student-org funding.

“You all are picking and choosing 
with your freedom-of-speech battles,” 
VP Finance and Resources Peter 

Benesch said. “It’s 
really weird.”

About 50 
students, presum-
ably contacted 
via text message 
from friends at the 
meeting, arrived 

to pressure the council to fund poten-
tially controversial event speakers.

As it turns out, many council-
members were instead debating SJP’s 
spoken-word event, which was not the 
event in question.

In new business, a motion to 
appoint four new members to the A.S. 
Judicial Board temporarily became 
another contentious debate. 

Three of the four applicants were 
from the Sixth College Judicial Board 
— trained the same way as members 
of the A.S. Judicial Board.

The council debated the partiality 
of these members, and every other 
move was described as “shady.”

A.S. Executive Assistant Heather 
Lucas said that the judicial-board 
chaos was her fault. “These people 
didn’t specify that they were graduat-
ing in spring, and were not going to 
be here in the fall… I should have fol-
lowed up on it,” she said.

Councilmembers argued about 
the judicial board with no motion on 
the table, and the general ridiculous-
ness continued until someone wrote 
on the projected computer screen, 
“Resolution to impeach Utsav Gupta, 
WHEREAS it would solve everything.”

Lately, I’ve been feeling guilty about drinking water.It’s not the same sort of glut-
tonous regret that sinks into my 
stomach after inhaling a double-
double cheeseburger with fries at 
In-And-Out, nor the same fiscal 
recklessness I feel when I blow half 
my measly Guardian paycheck on 
a pair of cowboy boots — only to 
realize three days later they give me 
blisters.

No, my water-drinking guilt has 
more to do with a phenomenon 
that has pervaded my thoughts ever 
since I hauled my ass to college: my 
consumer conscience. 

Some time during my four-year 
stint at UCSD, I realized that almost 
every purchase I make somehow 
contributes to the demise of our 
planet. For every gallon of gas I 
pump, an endangered baby seal is 
clubbed in Alaska. For every page I 
print of an essay, an acre of redwood 
trees is annihilated. When I bought 
my first Russell Brand sweatshirt at 
the UCSD Bookstore, I was indirect-
ly whipping the back of a Honduran 
infant for not sewing fast enough.

But the image that most haunts 
my purchase-induced day terrors 
is that of a helpless Nemo-esque 
clownfish being driven from his 
kelpy wonderland by a colony of 
Aquafina bottles somewhere in the 
North Pacific Garbage Patch. No 
matter how parched my lips, every 
time I grabbed a bottle of water at 
the Sunshine Store, my guilt far out-
weighed the quench.

So, my first step in consumer 
redemption was to choose the self-
proclaimed Mother Teresa of H20: 
Fiji water. Marketed as the trendy 
green choice for eco-concerned con-
sumers like myself, it seemed like 
the least of evils I could turn to in 
times of thirst.

That is, until I happened upon an 
investigative article on MotherJones.
com revealing that, despite the 
water company’s success (which 
has secured both Paris Hilton and 
Barack Obama as consumers),  
Fijians themselves are suffering from 
typhoid outbreaks because of the 
island’s faulty water supplies. 

Not to mention, the brand’s edgy 
square bottles are made of Chinese 
plastic and cranked out in a diesel-
fueled plant polluting some far-off 
land.

Somehow, in attempting to 
make a sustainable choice, I’d added 
Typhoid-ridden Fijians to my list of 
day terrors. Now I wish I hadn’t lost 
the trendy Whole Foods canteen my 
mom got me for Christmas. I’d buy 
myself another one, but those things 
are like $25. 

Maybe tonight I’ll sacrifice a 
couple hours locating my long-lost 
stocking stuffer — if not to prevent 
spontaneous sunstroke, then to 
dissolve my thoughts of diseased 
islanders. And if I can’t find the can-
teen, maybe I’ll just continue being 
really, really thirsty all the time. I 
hear San Diego’s suffering from a 
pretty severe draught — maybe I 
can do my part with some good old-
fashioned activism in the form of 
dehydration.

The UCSD Guardian is published twice a week at 
the University of California at San Diego. Contents © 
2010. Views expressed herein represent the majority 

vote of the editorial board and are not necessarily 
those of the UC Board of Regents, the ASUCSD or 

the members of the Guardian staff. 

As journalists, we are instinctively programmed to fight, kick and scream for the eternal preservation of free press. The pillars of our value system include equal distribution rights for any and all 
publications, and absolutely no censorship nor government-influenced 
propaganda. 

These ideals, however, when dealing with student fees, must not inter-
fere with the stark pragmatism of the almighty dollar. Because, as it turns 
out, free press isn’t really all that free. Ink and paper — no matter how 
necessary to communicating the diverse views of the student body — are 
among the more costly resources covered by the A.S. Council. In the case 
of student publications on our campus, these provisions carried a price 
tag of roughly $40,000 this quarter — all approved and paid for by the 
council.

That’s an awful lot of bank to ensure that Fashion Quarterly can com-
ment in full color on the latest Library Walk trends, or that the Koala’s 
marijuana leaves can finally print in green. 

All criticism aside, though, the wealth of publications at UCSD makes 
for an invaluable forum of public discourse. They show us that our cam-
pus, however notoriously anti-social, is filled with exuberant young peo-
ple busting with creative, political wit and activist fervor — and they’re 
eager to show it off. 

Thanks to the A.S. Council’s “open forum” media org funding model, 
however, there’s no real limit to how much media orgs can request to ful-
fill their vision. Though allocations are still subject to the council’s discre-
tion, as of this quarter, media-org funding has surpassed the figure in the 

council’s budget by about $35,000. 
A significant chunk went toward edgy new fashion magazine 

No. 15, which requested $8,693.43 to print 3,000 issues on glossy 
paper. Associate Vice President of Student Orgs Andrew Ang justi-
fied the amount by explaining that the publication wants to be a 
work of art that isn’t just “thrown away.” 

After their brief foray into the seedy underbelly of absolute 
media control, it seems councilmembers like Ang are practically 
throwing money at campus newspapers to compensate. They’re 
itching to prove just how much they adore the concept of free 
speech, frantically scrubbing their hands of any blame for last quar-
ter’s unconstitutionally biased targeting of the Koala in particular. 

With such liberty, however, comes significant financial risk. 
Though the council is sitting comfortably on a rejuvenated bank 
account after student activity fees were nearly doubled for Spring 
Quarter 2009, it’s only a matter of time before the budget begins to 
strain again. 

During last quarter’s media funding freeze, A.S. President 
Utsav Gupta proposed media-org guidelines that would allow 
the council to distribute a pre-determined base amount to any 
organization who wished to publish. We think that’s a great idea. 
Unfortunately, Gupta’s proposal also allowed for the council 
to pick and choose which publications would receive the paid 
A.S. advertisements. That’s where things get messy. The idea of 
offering direct financial support based on a set of Principles of

DRAWING FIRE By Johan DeLaTorre

Dear Editor,

This is a critical time for the 
University of California. With the 
struggles students face against bud-
get cuts, hate crimes and access and 
affordability to the university, we must 
stand in solidarity to ensure the qual-
ity of life on campus is one of unity 
and diversity. Student government 
is an important political avenue that 
should advocate on behalf of the inter-
est of all students on campus.

Student governments must pri-
oritize putting the issues that affect 
students at the forefront of the campus 
agenda. These issues consist of provid-
ing students with an affordable college 
experience, ensuring a sustainable 
lifestyle, fostering student and civic 
engagement as well as fighting for the 
diverse student-body interest. The 
political platform represented by the 
executive candidates of the Students 
First slate emphasizes student engage-
ment, accessible affordable and quality 
education, student unity, accountabil-
ity and transparency. These priorities 
expressed by Students First focus on 
the most pertinent issues affecting 
student life.

In this critical point in the history 
of the UC system, California and edu-
cation as a whole, it is time for us to 
take concrete action and entrust indi-
viduals with the experience and pas-
sion to best represent student needs. 
As the undergraduate student body 
president at UCLA, I fully endorse 
the student first, and I am confident 
that the Students First slate at UCSD 
is more than ready to answer this call 
to action.

Dear Editor,  
I was reading the April 1, 2010 

Guardian article “Board Passes 
Housing, Dining Fee Increases,” 
and I was a little disappointed and 
confused about the information 
given. Overall, I thought it was a 
well-written and clear article, but I 
was quoted as saying that I believe 
UCSD’s housing rates are the lowest 
in comparison to all of the other UC 
campuses. 

The next line of the article then 
said that UCSD is actually the 
third cheapest UC campus behind 
UC Merced and UC Riverside. 
Perplexed, I visited both UC Merced 
and UC Riverside’s Web sites and 
found that the on-campus hous-
ing cost at UC Merced is $12,801 
for the 2010-11 academic year; UC 
Riverside costs $11,600. According 
to UCSD’s Web site, our estimated 
cost for next year is $11,527. Relying 
solely on the information provided 
on the schools’ Web sites, it seems 
that both UC Merced and UC 
Riverside are actually more expen-
sive than UCSD, so I was a little con-
fused as to why the article said they 
were cheaper.

Community — which could be inter-
preted in a variety of ways — opens 
room for funding bias. 

It may be within the council’s 
right to take stances on contentious 
political and social issues, but when 
distributing funds from a pool of 
student fees, councilmembers must 
strive to do so in an equitable man-
ner — especially when said fees are 
ostensibly distributed with the pur-
pose of promoting diverse campus 
discourse. 

Here’s our alternative: Determine 
a set amount of cash per quarter to 
allocate to each and every media 
organization that wants to publish. 
Give each organization just enough 

to publish two issues per quarter, 
including full color on the front and 
back covers of each issue. (This would 
allow for a color centerspread at no 
extra cost.)For publications wishing 
to take the form of a magazine, the 
allotment would be slightly higher, 
due to the cost of glossy paper. 

Based on the rates of Guardian 
printer San Diego Web Offset — 
whose prices are generally in the mid-
range — the cost per quarter to fund 
a single tabloid newspaper would be 
just over $900 per issue. For a maga-
zine, the cost would be approximately 
$1,100 per issue. The organizations 
would still be required to detail the 
specifics of their spending, but allot-
ments could be capped there.

After receiving their base funding, 
the media orgs would be free to pub-
lish whatever they pleased. To cover 
any costs above their cap, however, 
they’d have to seek advertisers, hold 
fundraisers or solicit donations. 

Again, as newsies, it is difficult 
for us to criticize the distribution of 
unlimited free money to our peers. To 
continue funding these organizations 
without restraint, however, would 
be to support an ultimately unsus-
tainable model wherein costs could 
skyrocket one quarter and plunge 
dramatically the next. Adopting a 
universal basefunding system, on the 
other hand, would provide for equal-
ity, council neutrality and continued 
support for free press on our campus.

Don’t Hate 
the Players,

Real Pain

S orry, guys — that was one hell of an intermission. Act Two of “Compton Cookout: The Musical” needed some 
serious mulling. Plus, now that its springtime 
and Sun God unity is near, I think we can dig 
even harder on the beauty of what went down 
last winter — a raucous back-and-forth of 
action and reaction, with genius little script-
quips flying between camps, and enough out-
of-the-blue plot twists to send Scorsese back 
to the Dark Ages.

When we left off, Compton Cookout: The 
Party (namesake of my dear musical, which I 
proposed as therapy for monster racial tensions 
running through the cold eucalyptus groves of 
yesterquarter) was starting to really get loose.

Bros were aiming balls at sluts, sluts were 
harmonizing misogynistic Lil Jon and Lil 
Jon lookalike Jiggaboo Jones still lingered — 
like “The Wiz” in scar tissue — as a burn on 
our view of the awesome crimson curtain 
down back.

So, just when the sluts and bros think 
they’re safe beneath the memory of Jiggaboo 
— who will, on the closing curtain, return to 
take maternal responsibility for white sluts who 
dress as ghetto chicks when bros on Facebook 
tell them so — a mysterious goo begins to fall. 
Bucket after bucket of deconstructed purple 
drank is overturned from the rafters, unleash-
ing a glistening waterfall of ingredients: streams 
of chicken broth, Kool-Aid, chicken broth, 
Kool-Aid. The “all you bitches crawl” chorus 
melts into a hearty “make it rain on dem hoes” 
— this time, just the boys, in baritone! — and 
purple drank washes the remaining fried-

Muir “Seussical” cuts and

>
ey, guys?” Rachelle Fuhrer asked the 
harmonizing cast of “Seussical the 
Musical,” most of whom had just 
returned from a pizza break.

“We’re back!” she snapped. “Seats, 
please.”

Like complacent kindergartners in a nos-
talgic Norman Rockwell, they plunked into the 
chairs before her, eagerly awaiting instruction. 

Their picturesque obedience was broken only 
by a mohawk, a pair of leopard ears and the 
candy cane-striped top hat of the Cat in the Hat 
among the crowd. 

It’s a weighty thing to direct the annual Muir 
Musical, and yet another to transform such a 
hodgepodge of drama students into the smiley 
inhabitants of Whoville.

Somehow, though, despite a double major 

in mathematics/computer science and interdis-
ciplinary computing and the arts, Fuhrer has 
managed to pull off both Thing One and Thing 
Two.

T hink of the lineup for Warren Live as a miniature version of the Sun God 
Festival we really wanted. It’s 
two parts dance, one part rock 
and unlimited parts awesome. 
While San Diego natives Delta 
Spirit ease us into the evening 
with a nicely homespun brand 
of blues-rock, electro-poppers 
Junior Boys and Pop Noir really 
set the grind: Get ready to 
sweat and choke on glowsticks 
all night long. 

Pop Noir — a Los Angeles-
based dance-rock trio formed 
by British-born twins Joe and 
Luke McGarry — has been 
quickly picking up speed from 
debut single “DIY.” The music 

video recently peeled some eye-
lids after scoring a spot on the 
rotation for MTV’s new show 
“The Freshmen,” setting their 
signature sound with an mmm-
bop chorus and driving beat 
straight out of a long-forgotten 
pop ballad by Manchester 
luminaries New Order.

Pop Noir Guitarist Joe 
McGarry took a moment to 
talk with the Guardian about 
the band’s identity, starting a 
record label and whether we 
can expect a little tasteful vio-
lence at the show on Friday.  

  

G: “DIY” is kind of your signa-
ture song and aesthetic. Why 
the decision to start your own 
label and do all of your own 

publicity?
JM: I think the main thing is 
that we’re control freaks. We 
do everything. As well as the 
music, we do illustration and 
graphic design, and we wanted 
to have the excuse to do all of 
our own artwork and promo-
tional materials. We don’t have 
to pay anybody to do it, and we 
enjoy it. Then we figured while 
we’re doing that we might as 
well keep total control over the 
music we release, and all the 
rights to it, too. We are sort of 
weird about anyone else having 
input on it. 
G: As both musicians and art-
ists, what’s more important? 
Does the music ever influence 
the illustration, or vice versa?

If dark Cohen Brothers comedies are your bread and butter, 
Ken Cinema will quench your craving for understated wit and 
twisted humor with Henrik Ruben Genz’s “Terribly Happy.” 
Denmark’s ofﬁcial Oscar selection and the winner of 19 
international ﬁlm awards, the police thriller tells the story of a 
Copenhagen cop (Jakob Cedergren) transferred to a small 
town after a nervous breakdown. While adapting to his new 
position and the bizarre townsfolk, he gets entangled with a 
married woman (Lene Maria Christensen) buried in domestic 
drama — raising the age-old question of who he can truly 
trust. Prepare for an artfully constructed Danish noir that will 
keep you clawing at your cupholder. (JB)

You might’ve seen Leigh Cole’s giant lit-up “SEX”

ALBUMREVIEWS

Usher
Raymond v. Raymond
LAFACE

I t’s no surprise that Usher chose divorce as the theme of his sixth album, consider-
ing his recent separation from 
Tameka Foster. After 2008’s 
Here I Stand delved similarly 
into the tormented pop star’s 
personal issues, his R&B has 
taken a serious departure from 
its roots, transforming from 
club-ready, hurt-numbing 
bump ‘n’ grinds to a long soul-
ful whine — causing sales and 
critical reception to (deserv-
edly) suffer.

But on Raymond v. 
Raymond — whose name 
is inspired by 1979 Dustin 
Hoffman and Meryl Streep 
divorce film “Kramer vs. 
Kramer” — Usher’s two per-
sonas try to reconcile. He 
bounces between reflecting 
on his failed domesticity and 

dropping it like it’s hot for 
Billboard. The result is an 
incoherent hodgepodge of 
momentumless emotion that 
hardly manages to budge the 
empathy meter.

Raymond may parade a 
potpourri of hotshot producers 
— Jermaine Dupri, Will.i.am, 
Polow da Don, RedOne, Danja 
and T.I. — but they only add 
to the overall inconsistency 
of the tracklist. Oedipal lead 
single “Hey Daddy (Daddy’s 
Home) makes a desperate 
attempt at distracting us from 
its redundant R&B groove 
with a creepy pedophilic con-
fession. Usher’s signature rich 
tenor and impressive range 
are undeniable, but his muse 
has left the building: Over-
tumbled loops and overuse of 
the pimp-in-the-club fantasy 

border on intolerable. We do 
get a breather with “Papers” 
— the first moment of hon-
esty on the album — whose 
falsetto almost resembles that 
of (dare I say it?) a certain 
Mickey Mouse Clubber gone 
soulman, not to mention 
Usher’s young protigee Justin 
Bieber. Bubblegum synths 
make “Guilty” a less catchy 
“Baby,” as Usher’s maturity 
level likewise drops to that 
of a 16-year-old: “I guess I’m 
guilty for wanting to be up in 
the club/ I guess I’m guilty for 
leaving and having a little fun” 
and “Your honor, she accused 
me of cheating.” We can excuse 
Bieber a few rosy-cheeked 
playground jabs, but Usher just 
comes off R. Kelly creepy.

E-40
Revenue Retrievin’
SICK WID IT

N otorious for a madlib lyric format and syn-thed-out jive beat, Bay 
Area native E-40 doesn’t 
stray far from the winning 
formula on the  38-track 
double disc Revenue 
Retrievin’. The album is 
made up of mild-mannered 
Clark Kent (Day Shift) and 
his Mr. Hyde counterpart 
(Night Shift) — combining 
for a five-hour mixed bag 
that, by omitting the art-
ist’s own hubris, could have 
been culled to a three-hour 
hit machine. 

Day Shift imbues the 
drudgery of the daily grind 
with the glamour of the big 
pimp. Its high notes are are 
wall-shaking neo-classics 
that throw back to 2006’s 
“Tell Me When to Go”; 

“Whip It Up” features a 
silky-smooth Gucci Mane 
crooning about an “early 
morning hustler tryin’ to 
make a living,” and “Bitch” 
stars the oily Too Short as a 
soft-spoken counterpoint to 
40’s punchy baritone.

The campy “shake them 
dreads” mindset that E-40 
popularized on My Ghetto 
Report Card still thrives 
here, but sheer double-disc 
quantity reveals the 42-year-
old’s inability to discern the 
badass from the ugly.

Uniform Day ditties 
like “Duck” and “The 
Weedman” drag on like a 
tenured professor. On the 
other hand, Night Shift suf-
fers from an entirely differ-
ent ailment: All tracks are 
semi-tolerable, but none 

packed with enough juice 
to warrant a hit’s worth of 
enthusiasm. 

Still, Night openers “Over 
the Stove” and “Nice Guys” 
kick off Retrievin’ part deux 
right, the latter wuth a 
charmingly vigorous procla-
mation that nice guys — you 
guessed it — finish last. 

Regardless of 40’s lazy 
lyrical missteps and mean-
dering midway tracks, 
Retrievin’ boasts a quick-
paced, oft-electro backbeat 
and a host of witticisms as 
loveable as a foul-mouthed 
Dora the Explorer. This 
here might as well be vin-
tage E-40, so keep shakin’ 
’em like you been doin’ it all 
along.

E-40 Goes Dumb ’Til He’s Old and We’re Numb

8�THE UCSD GUARDIAN� THURSDAY, APRIL 8, 2010� HIATUS

chicken grease from the wife-beatered 
fronts of all partygoers. Sluts’ faces 
are serene, for they are remembering 
a craving they felt during their quiet 
suburban childhoods to be slimed 
onstage like Nickelodeon peers in 
braceface.

As Jiggaboo’s brothers/sisters from 
other mothers melt to the ground like 
they’re on some wicked-witch shtick, 
a perfect marching block of humans 
in black body suits (with holes only 
for their orifices) marches across the 
stage, back and forth, solemn as pray-
ing mantises, engaged in a gospel 
round of “Real pain/ Shut it down.” 
This is a practical element in that it 
allows bros and sluts to escape and 
tidy up in their dressing rooms back-

stage, while of course giving the audi-
ence a great feeling of solidarity with 
this chugging train of Black Student 
Unioners and whoever else may be 
marching beneath a body suit.

The next scene takes place at the 
Student-Run Television studio. Joose 
cans litter the floor. A row of wit-
nesses with their hands over their eyes 
encircle the ratty centerstage sofa, 
where a particularly hairy man sits in 
a poncho. He bobbles his head and 
unleashes a string of letters in no par-
ticular order for five or more minutes, 
until it becomes excruciatingly incom-
prehensible. There is a brief pause of 
welcome silence until he leaps up for 
his operatic battle cry: “Ungrateful 
niggers!” The witnesses move their 
hands to their ears in a grand slap and 

begin to repeat his toxic phrasing like 
larks on a loop, climbing in octave 
until we can’t even hear the words 
anymore. Lights down.

Remember, this is art. It’s sup-
posed to make you angry. The BSU 
block marches through once more, 
so that Joose cans may be brushed to 
the stage gutters and the SRTV office 
may be closed for business. They pace 
a little longer this time, but eventu-
ally part their rectangle to reveal the 
limp figure of M.A. Fox, hanging from 
the ceiling by a piñata levy, manned 
by the heroic Penny Rue. We won’t 
even need a real actress for Fox — a 
dummy with red-rimmed orbish eye-
balls will do.

Sit tight until next week. The real 
Cookout has only just begun.

more prismatic language of Dr. Seuss, 
brought to life onstage in a whirlwind 
of feather boas and polka-dot stage 
lighting.

In “Seussical,” Fuhrer explained, 
there’s “no formula — no right 
answer, no wrong answer. The idea, 
visually and theatrically, is that it’s a 
storybook coming to life.” 

But her affinity for number-
crunching doesn’t hurt either. When 
it comes to financial matters, she and 
stage manager Janessa Marks — a 
major in (you guessed it) econom-
ics — are “organizationally OCD, and 
nazis with money,” and have allocated 
only 80 percent of the itemized bud-
get to each team in production. 

Like all tales in the Dr. Seuss 
canon, the musical also carries an 
underlying moral lesson. 

“‘Seussical’ is not just about a 
cutesy elephant,” Fuhrer said. “There 
are very real problems, like child 
abandonment and drug addiction. 
We’re just sugar-coating it in Dr. 
Seuss style.” 

Her own sugary personality seems 
to stick the cast obliging and the show 
intact. Having acted in three previous 
Muir Musicals and choreographed 
last year’s rendition of “Kiss Me, 
Kate,” Fuhrer now directs “Seussical” 
with the intent of keeping the process 
“organic.”

“The actors are not puppets,” she 
said. “They’re people and want to 
have their own heart and soul in what 
they’re doing.” 

Somewhat contrary to Fuhrer’s 
amicable personality, her mantra 
throughout “Seussical” has been that 
“directing is the art of correcting the 

mistakes you made in casting.” Of 
course, she hasn’t told that to the cast 
yet. But throughout rehearsal — less 
than a week before opening night — a 
string of onstage mishaps are more 
than enough to explain the wasteland 
of empty bottles on the table behind 
which she and Janessa critique the 
night’s run-throughs: Diet Coke, an 
oversized can of Monster and a venti 
Starbucks cup.

Cueing the music to stop, Fuhrer 
shouted at the actor playing Horton 
the elephant: “Jordan, you should still 
be wearing your scarf!” With a line 
of assault-rifle props pointed at him, 
Jordan is scissoring the air with his 
feet, perched atop a 15-foot paper-
mache tree.

“Oh,” Jordan replied coyly. 
“Should I go get it?” 

Rachelle continued fist-pumping 
the cast and crew through the second 

act. “You have to learn to love it!” she 
shouted.

At the Circus McGurkus that fol-
lowed, one of the performers pointed 
out yet another technical problem: “I 
can’t back-flip in a corset.” She did a 
run-through with it off, but another 
problem soon surfaced: Jordan is on 
stage when he should be in the air, 
back up on the tree. “How do I get 
back on?” he asked, Horton’s pink-
and-purple ball clutched childishly in 
his hands.

Whether or not Horton finds his 
way back up come opening night, the 
air of familial ease bouncing between 
director, cast and crew in Mandeville 
Auditorium will make for an authen-
tic storybook experience. Ninety-nine 
and three-quarters guaranteed.

“Seussical the Musical” runs April 
8 through April 10 at Mandeville 
Auditorium.

JM: I do think it all sort of feeds off 
itself. The art does influence music. I 
guess it’s really aesthetic sensibilities 
that influence whatever you do artis-
tically. So I think the music we like 
and make is somehow reflected in the 
type of art we do and what we think is 
visually cool. 
G: Your father , also an illustrator, 
notably designed record sleeves for 
bands like Joy Division. How did 
growing up with a father so engrained 
in the Manchester/Factory Records 
scene influence your own music? Did 
you subsequently try to steer clear of 
the sound from that movement?
JM: We certainly haven’t tried to 
steer clear of it. We just decided to 
make the music that we would like 
to hear. The whole Manchester scene 
has influenced us, specifically late 
’80s bands like the Happy Mondays 
and New Order. I think more of that 
comes through with what we’re doing. 
I mean, it’s not really a conscious deci-
sion, but we’ve been listening to that 
stuff since the day we were born. I 
think it definitely has permeated. We 
are trying to make hip dance music, 
so there is no escaping it, really.
G: Yet you guys got your start in the 
States, and are really more of an LA 
band. So what American artists are 
influential to you guys?
JM: The American artists that have 

influenced us the most are from when 
we first started going to shows locally. 
Bands like Dance Disaster Movement 
— who were originally a duo — were 
running everything through loop 
pedals so they could play everything 
themselves. And that’s actually how 
we started out: with the two of us, 
a drum machine and two or three 
loop pedals, just looping everything. 
So they were a major influence on 
us when we started out. And I think 
that’s sort of why we went into dance 
music so naturally. There’s really no 
other choice when there’s two of you 
and a drum machine. 
G: Do you consider yourself more of a 
Manchester band or an LA band?
JM: It’s sort of tough for us because 
we mostly play in LA and are based 
in Orange County, but we’re from 
Manchester and our drummer is 
Chilean. So we don’t really consider 
ourselves anything. We’re not an OC 
band really, we’re not an LA band 
really [and] we’re not a UK band 
really. It’s sort of like our accents — it’s 
neither one or the other. We’re not 
American or English. We have no 
identity, I guess. 
G: So what’s the twin thing like? Ever 
get all Liam/Noel Gallagher on each 
other, or do you work well together?
JM: We do get in fights, but it’s never 
Gallagher-esque. I guess that’s the 
benefit of being brothers or twins 

in a band, especially having moved 
between the U.S. and the UK so 
much. We’re sort of each other’s best 
friends, whether we like it or not. We 
don’t have to worry about each other’s 
feelings. If Luke is doing something 
that I don’t like, I can just tell him, 
“That’s stupid. Stop it.” I don’t have to 
be tactful. Even if he’s upset with me, 
we’ll be fine in an hour. We have this 
close relationship so that we can say 
anything to each other. 
G: It might be more interesting if you 
guys started blatantly hating each 
other. 
JM: We probably should have more 
animosity between us. I’ll work on 
that. At the show on [April] 9 I’ll just 
punch him in the face on stage.  
G: Apart from brother-on-brother 
violence, what else should we expect 
from the show on Friday?
JM: So far, we have yet to have a ter-
rible show. If there [are] people there, 
I think everyone can have a good 
time. If nobody is there, whoever is 
there can expect to have a good time. 
My theory is that people tend to dance 
more if you’re in a huge group of peo-
ple and no one can see you dancing 
— as long as you don’t stand out.  But 
I am expecting to have a good time, so 
I hope everyone else is too.

Pop Noir will take the stage at 
Warren Live on April 9 at 6:30 p.m. at 
Warren Mall. Free.

Come Join the Adventure! T he good news: Dakota Fanning has never acted so young in her life. The bad news: She’s just as 
creepy as ever.

Based on the story of the first 
commercially successful all-girl rock 
band in America, “The Runaways” 
tells the story of five schoolgirls who 
come of age on the road and quickly 
learn how the music industry can be 
your friend one day and screw you 
over the next. 

The narrative focuses on 
good-girl-gone-bad Cherie Currie 
(Fanning) and rebelious guitarist Joan 
Jett (Kristen Stewart) as they grapple 
with the trials and tribulations of 
instant success on a global level. The 
band’s rise to glory is not an easy one; 
as Currie’s ego takes hold and their 
Bowie-esque manager Kim Fowley’s 
(Michael Shannon) ego inflates, the 
group sets off down the well-trodden 
rock-star path to self-destruction. 

Not only has the story been seen 
and heard before — albeit maybe 
not with teenage girls, unless you 
count Josie and the Pussycat Dolls 
— director and screenwriter Floria 
Sigismondi makes no attempt to 
scramble the formula. Even a brief 
sexual relationship between Currie 
and Jett, which develops on the road, 
is so obviously foreshadowed from 
the moment the two meet in a grrrl-
rock club that we’re impatiently wait-
ing for the two to hook up for the rest 
of the film instead of watching the 

drama unfold.
But never fear, horny freshmen — 

that time does eventually come, and 
Sigismondi makes sure to slow the 
erotic lesbianism so we really get the 
full effect.

At first, Fanning plays her naive 
role with prowess, but her transfor-
mation into 
the band’s 
bad-ass vocal-
ist is utterly 
unbelievable 
and more dis-
turbing than 
most scenes 
from “Uptown 
Girls.” While 
tides of filmic 
fans lap up her rock-star attitude, 
Fanning’s sexy, glamorous Currie is 
just plain uncomfortable for those 
of us who still remember her as the 
fairy child from “I Am Sam.” Things 
get especially awkward when she 
shows up on stage in lingerie. The 
16-year-old Fanning — who’s made 

a living up to now as a child actor in 
roles that require a 60-year-old soul 
— simply hasn’t matured enough to 
play a diva addled by drugs and life 
on the road. 

Because the three other mem-
bers of the group are pushed so far 
into the background, the fight that 

eventually erupts 
between Currie 
and her band-
mates — bringing 
an end to the 
Runaways — has 
little buildup or 
explanation. With 
a disturbing lack 
of twisty charac-
ters or unexpected 

turns, “The Runaways” leaves little 
reason for us to become invested in 
the girls’ story. The only demographic 
that might be stoked enough to sit 
through the stock plot is the teenage 
girl grasping for a reason to rebel 
against her cush suburban society. 
Sound familiar, Fanning?

that the score is 56-55 Duke, and I 
think to myself: “FML for missing 
this game.”

3:16 minutes left: I watch the little 
white sundial go round and round, 
but there aren’t any updates. Blue 
Devils fan continues to ask if there’s 
an update, while bad-breath guy talks 
about the business he supposedly 
runs. I think he’s lying, so I use my 
phone to verify his story, and it checks 
out. I contemplate which company 
has the best waiting icon. Apple’s 
pinwheel makes me dizzy, and the 
Windows hour glass of death actually 
makes me feel like I’m aging more 
quickly than usual. 

I decide the iPhone sundial is the 
best and wish I had a real-life one 
to gauge if Blue Devils fan has ever 
actually thought before speaking. An 

update finally pops up: The score is 
60-55 for Duke after two Nolan Smith 
free throws.  Blue Devils fan throws 
out high-fives to anyone willing.

1:42 minutes left: After almost 
10 minutes of real time, we finally get 
an update. I am deathly sick of Blue 
Devils fan. I begin thinking I should 
challenge him to hold his breath 
between updates.

54 seconds left: Butler scores and 
makes it a one-point game at 60-59. 
This sends Blue Devils fan into a ram-
page. He paces up and down the aisle 
of the train and almost knocks over a 
lady carrying two bottles of wine from 
the dining cart. I think I just found 
my after-game refuge.

13 seconds left: It’s still a one-
point game, and Butler has the ball. I 
try to hide the info from Blue Devils 
fan so  I won’t have to deal with him.  

I also want to slap bad-breath guy so 
he doesn’t breath down my neck any 
longer. God he smells. The anticipa-
tion is starting to get to me. 

Three seconds left: Game over. 
Zoubek makes a free throw, and 
Butler’s only hope is half-court 
prayer. I update Blue Devils fan and 
he jumps with joy, nearly breaking a 
leg when he lands. He lets out a yelp 
of pleasure and goes back to his seat. 
Bad-breath guy sighs heavily, which 
makes me immediately wish I had a 
gas mask. Fortunately, he leaves my 
personal space and returns to his 
seat. The poor lady who was stuck in 
the same proximity as us glances at 
me and nods her head in approval. 
Apparently, she was a fan, too.

God bless technology. Without it, 
I would’ve missed the almost best-
game-ever.

with two home runs, one triple and 
five RBIs. Junior third baseman Evan 
Kehoe had a great day at the plate, 
going five-for-five with a home run 
and a pair of RBIs. 

Junior second baseman Blake 
Tagmeyer also had a two-home run 
game, plating five Tritons in the pro-
cess. Senior righty Kirby St. John 
improved his record to 7-1 as he tossed 
six and two-thirds solid innings. 

“We expected a tough series 
because they are a talented team that 
has been winning a good amount of 
games this year so far,” Lee said. “As 
a team, we refocused and played very 
well in game two to even up the series.”

UCSD returned to Triton Ballpark 
on Saturday looking to win the series 
in a doubleheader. Senior righty Matt 
Rossman threw eight innings of one-
run ball, allowing eight hits and strik-
ing out six as the Tritons eased to a 
12-1 victory. 

Alongside Rossman’s skill on the 
mound, Gregorich and Kehoe did 
their part on the offense, serving up a 
combined five-for-ten day at the plate, 
including four RBIs and a home run 
by Kehoe. 

The second game of the double-
header lasted seven innings, each one 
controlled by the Coyotes. With a 
series split in sight, CSUSB put in just 
enough effort for a 3-2 win. Junior 
right-hander Guido Knudson grinded 
out six and two-thirds sweaty innings, 
allowing three runs on ten hits. He 
struck out six batters and allowed 
zero walks. Aside from a solo shot by 
Bauman, the Triton offense only man-
aged three total hits. 

UCSD threatened an upset in the 
final inning by loading the bases and 
coming within a tying run, but couldn’t 
bring it home.

“Coming back to our home field 
for games three and four is always 
a great situation for us, because we 

have a good amount of success play-
ing at home,” Lee said. “In game three, 
we came out swinging, and Rossman 
pitched extremely well. We were feel-
ing confident and ready to take the 
series in game four after that win. 
However, San Bernardino’s pitcher 
held our offense to only three hits, and 
the way we played is not reflected in 
the score.”

The Tritons now stand at 30-5 over-
all and 20-4 in California Collegiate 
Athletic Association action. They 
dropped three spots to No. 4 in the 
national rankings. 

UCSD will now set its sights on Cal 
State Stanislaus in a four-game series. 
The Warriors have won six of their 
last eight games. While the Tritons 
head the league with a team Earned 
Run Average of 3.36, CSUS ranks right 
behind them with a 3.53 ERA.

HOTCORNERAROUND THE LEAGUE
On April 5, Duke University defeated 
Butler University 61-59 in the final game 
of the 2010 NCAA D-I National Basketball 
Championships. It was the smallest margin 
of victory in a final since 1989.

After an incredible run that pushed the team to a No. 1 ranking, the Tritons’ momentum finally came to a halt against San Bernardino last weekend with an uncharacteristic shelling of 
their ace pitcher, junior right-hander Tim Shibuya.

UCSD saw its record 19-game win streak come to an 
end with a 4-3 loss to Cal State San Bernardino on April 1. 
By April 2, the Tritons had lost another of the four games 
in the series against the Coyotes. It was the first time they 
did not win a series since February. 

Shibuya took his first loss of the season in game one, 
when he was tagged for four runs on eight hits in six and 
one-third innings. His record fell to 7-1. 

Senior center fielder Robert Sedin’s single drove in two 
runs, and junior outfielder Aaron Bauman hit a solo homer 
— but that was all the scoring the Tritons could muster, 
despite their total of nine hits in the game. The men loaded 
the bases in the ninth inning but could not come through 
in the clutch. 

 “In game one, we battled and played well, but came up 
a little short,” senior catcher Kellen Lee said. “We had many 
opportunities to drive more runs in, but couldn’t capitalize. 
That is something we definitely need to improve on.” 

The Tritons rebounded in game two with a 14-7 victory 
on Friday. The offense exploded for 20 hits and 14 runs, 
with most action coming from the middle of the lineup. 
Senior first baseman Brandon Gregorich went four-for-five

When I booked a train  home from Fresno last weekend, I never thought it would 
mean missing the almost best-game-
ever, between Duke and Butler. After 
watching Butler shoot a pathetic 30.6 
percent against Sparty, and Duke 
trounce a very good West Virginia 
team on April 3, I thought for sure the 
Bulldogs would get pitchforked by the 
Blue Devils in the national champion-
ship game on Tuesday.  

My ill-advised confidence guided 
me to choose a late train home. Hey, 
I thought, it’s not like I’ll be missing 
anything more than a repeat 20-point 
championship blowout. 

Good thing I’m not a betting man. 
As my train-seat rumbled beneath my 
stupid assuming ass and a crowd of 
people began clustering around my 
seat, all I could think was: Thank god 
for my iPhone.

Ten years ago, I used to carry 
around a portable TV. I would sit 
in class with the TV under my desk 
and the antennae perfectly angled to 
run along the bottom of the desk so I 
wouldn’t miss a second of action. But 
the TV wouldn’t have done much good 
bouncing from train station to train sta-
tion like a hot potato.  

Had last Tuesday fallen 10 years 
before, I would’ve been screwed. But it 
wasn’t, and I was fortunate enough to 
have my cracked, yet faithful, iPhone 
in tow — equipped with a divine 3G 
network.  Let me first say that if AT&T 
truly is the fastest 3G network on the 
market, I’d rather carry around a ham-
ster running on a wheel to power my 
phone. I mean, come on; if an offensive 
lineman can run a 40-yard dash in 
under five seconds, a multibillion dollar 
company like AT&T ought to be able 
to do it in half the time. But, in the end, 
the slower-than-molasses-in-winter blue 
bar running across my Safari Web page 
only added to the angst and excitement 
on the train.  

As the game wound down to a close, 
I found myself sharing my elation with 
strangers I was quite certain I’d never 
see again. Fans in Indianapolis, Ind. got 
to breathe the tension with some 70,000 
others. Fans at home got to sit on the 
edge of their comfortable La-Z-Boy 
with their closest buddies. What did I 
get? I got some guy who hadn’t brushed 
his teeth in at least three days, a hard-
core Blue Devils fan that yelled in my 
ear every time an update appeared on 
my phone and some helpless lady who 
probably would’ve rather been standing 
before a firing squad than sitting near us.  

In a game that I never expected to 
come down to the final minutes, much 
less the opening tipoff, I’m just glad that 
I had my handy-dandy 3G with me.  
Here’s a breakdown of my experience in 
the last few minutes of the game.

5:06 minutes left: ESPN.com’s 
GameCast takes forever to load. Blue 
Devils fan keeps asking if there’s any 
update on my phone. He asks more 
times than a five-year-old would ask 
“Are we there yet?” on a long fam-
ily road trip. I start getting annoyed, 
and pray Blue Devils fan will shut 
up. Unfortunately, there isn’t an app 
for that. I decide to switch to ESPN’s 
ScoreCenter app. We finally discover
