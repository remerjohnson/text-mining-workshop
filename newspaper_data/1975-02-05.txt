Coop OKs Step II Plans 
for UCSD Student Center 

CALPIRG Reports May Get 
Coop Money After Mon. Vote 

The Student Cooperative 
Monday gave its approval to 
plans for Step II of the University 
tudent C nter, to be built ad-

jacent to the existing student 
cen ter facility . Approval was also 
granted to the principle of a Step 
III, which is in rudim ntary 
planning tages. 

Provo t John Stewart 

Also at Monday's meeting, 
members hard a r port on a 
program in the performing arts 
schedu led for next year, heard 
three Budget/ Re ource Group 
(BRG) de isions regarding 
funding , and discussed the 
Inadequacy some member 
perceive In the Triton Times. 

No Power 
Although the Coop has no 

tangible power to halt the Step II 
prog res , assistant vice-
cha ncellor for tudent affairs 
Mary Decker told the Triton 
Times that planners would have 

en "deeply concerned" if the 
Coop had voted to oppose Step II . 

Plans for Step II were halted 
last spring at the request of the 
tudent-faculty Building Advisory 
ommittee when some students 

said they objected to the plans, 
wh ich include student office and 
lounge space, a food service area, 
aod a possible student sales area . 
Decker said that some students 
wanted to include a bowling alley 
and other recreational facilities . 

" Those features weren ' t 
determined to be financially 
feasi ble," Decker said. " I think 
students have reconciled 
themselves to what they can get 
for their money." She said any 
fu rther halts would cause the 
price of the facility to inflate at a 
rate of 2% a month . 

Decker said Step II is scheduJed 
to go to bids shortly. 

~rtet' PQ'I'Am 
Coop ' members heard a report 

from Dave Solitare and Muir 
provo~ John Ste~art regardin~ 
preliminary plans for · the · 
presentation of a thr~uarter 
program of drama, music, and 
dance of the southwest, 
scheduled for next year. Although 
coi ncidental. with the nation's 
bicentential celebration, Stewart 
said yesterday that the program 
would not be connected with the 
nationwide celebration, nor 
would it affect ongoing speaker 
dnd arts program on the campus. 

The BRG de i ions were an-
noun d at Monday's meeting by 
(ommittee a Istant coordinator 
AI(> Nedelman. H(' ~aid the BRC 
held de ided to allow all memb('f~ 
to vote on all reque t , ('ven 

though members may be involved 
with groups making suc h 
requests . He said, however, that 
members will be allowed to 
excuse themselves from conflicts 
of interests they perceive 
themselves. 

In addition, the BRG has 
decided to fund work study on an 
" Individual organization" basis. 

The third decision, said 
N delman, i that the BRG "will 
mak realignments on any 
request for reallocations and on 
fea Ibly similar prOjects and

CALPIRG Reports, the monthly 
publication of the California 
Public Interest Research Group, 
may receive $1,300 from the 
Communications Board , a 
Student Cooperative vote in- ' 
dicated Monday. 

The vote was necessary 
b cause the Comm Board, ac-
ording to Student Center 

director Mark Bookman, felt that 
" it is spending Coop money, and 
b fore th ey fund In a new area 
they want a Coop OK " The 

omm Bo ard w as allocated 
$17,()()() last y ar by the Un-

dergraduate Stud nt Council , the 
Coop's predecessor, for " sub-
sidiary journals ." The $1 ,300 
would come from this allocation . 

The Comm Board wanted the 
vote because the Board's con-
stitution does not pres ently 
allow for the funding of 
publications over which it has no 
control , eith er editorial or

Six UC People Honored in Survey 
A national survey naming the nation's top 44 

leaders in higher education has honored a 
University of California president emeritus and a 
former UC chancellor along with two research 
ducators at the Berkel y campus and two UCLA 

professors . 
The largest vote by far in the survey went to Clark 

Kerr, who was UC's president from 1958 to 1967, 
and is now chai rman of the Berkeley-based Car-
n gie Counci l on Policy Studies in Higher 
Education. 

Others honored from UC were K. Patricia Cross 
and Harold Hodgkinson, both research members of 
UC Berkeley's Center for Research and Develop-
m nt in Higher Education, and Dr. Allan M. Cartter, 
profes or of higher education, and Dr. Arthur M . 
Cohen, associate professor of higher education, 
both of UCLA 

The "top 44" we're chosen in a poll of some 4,000 
persons in education and related fields conducted 
by Change, a magazine that reports on higher 
education . Re ults of the poll are published in 
Change's February issue. 

Nearly all of the 44 leaders I isted are university or 

foundation administrators, officials of educational 
associations, or political figures . Cartter and Cohen 
are among the half dozen working professors 
named 

Cartter, professor of higher education and 
director of UCLA's Laboratory for Research on 
Higher Education, is a former chancellor of New 
York University. Says Change, "Ten years ago 

artter came to national prominence for his dour 
prOlections of the future over-supply of Ph .D .s, 
which were shown to be accurate but which did not 
endear him to some educators." 

Cartter is also well known as the author of An 
Assessment .oJ .Quality in Graduate Education , a 
national survey ot graduate Instruction in American 
colleges and universities, published in 1966 when 
he was vice president of the American Council on 
Education 

Known popularly as the "Cartter Report," it was 
the most comprehensive rating of the academic 
tanding of U.S. universities eyer undertaken. 

Cohen, associate professor of higher education, 
is also a m mber of UCLA's Laboratory for Research 
on Higher Education . 

NORML Survey Finds Majority of 
California Public Favors Dope Reform 

A recent analysis of public 
opinion on the marijuana laws 
conducted by the National 
Organization for the Reform of 
Marijuana Laws (NORML) shows 
majority support for reduction of 
penalties as provided for in major 
legislation to be voted on by the 
Senate Judiciary Committee next 
week. 

The penalty reduction bill, 
Senate Bill 95, is authored by 
Senate Majority Leader George R. 
Moscone (San Francisco), former 
chairman of the Senate Select 
Committee on tile Control of 

in 1969, 1972, and 1973 which 
found growing support for 
liberalized, marijuana laws in all 
regions of California. The last 
survey conducted in November, 
1973--one year after the vote on 
Proposition 19-showed 51 % of 
all Californians favored 
liberalization of the present laws. 
Three regions of the State-the 
San Francisco bay area, the south 
central coast, and , most 
sign ificantly, Los Angeles and 
Orange counties-showed solid 
majority support for relaxed laws. 

Marijuana. It will be heard at a Dramatic: Inc:re~ses 
special order 'of ' the Senate "The regional break-down in

NORMl comptled a 'regional mented Cordon Brownell, west 
break-<bwn of data originally coa$t cOO1din~or for NORML. 
colleCted by the Field 'Research' "In each of the ten regions of the 
Corporation in statewide surveys 5tate, thefe have been dramatic 

increases in support for 
liberal ized laws and equally 
su bstantial decreases among 
persons favoring tougher 
penalties. Since the last Field 
survey was taken fifteen months 
ago, the trend in shifting attitudes 
would indicate even greater 
support exists today for the 
moderate reform embodied in 
Senate Bill 95 ." 

Under Senate Bill 95, penalties 
for possession of small amounts 
of marijuaFla \\Quid be reduced to 
an infraction, punishable by a 
5100 fine. While possession of 
even small amounts of marijuana I 
would · r.emain a crime in 
Cat ifornia, the practice of jailing 
persons . charged with imple 
pqssession would be eliminated.

Staff r Dismayed; Something Right 

As a me~ber of the paper's staff, I often ask 
students Aloot they think of the paper. I am 
dismayed .It the answers I receive and also what is 
not happening in relation to these problems. I hear 
that people don't read the paper because " It is no 
good " H w do they know that the paper is "no 
good" if they don't read it. Or if it has improved 
since the last time they have read it? 

I-urthermore, the criticizers seldom have any 
suggestions for improvements. If they don't like 
what we have, then what would they desire in the 
Triton Times? I was so glad when one girl came in to 
say that she was en joying the paper more and more, 
that it was improving, and she just wanted to let us 
know 

We would further appreciate students and staff 
members of the University to come and tell us what 
they don't like about the paper, what suggestions 
they might have, etc. Even better, if they would 
bring their ideas and implement them as staff 
members, we would be able to improve the paper 
and then people wouldn't say .. " I don't even read 
it "

We recently noticed that in the wee hours of a 

Tuesday, all the good parking places in the Revelle

the commuter students who need them .

Professor Friedkin: 
Did You Miss Our Point? 
By Student Committee For EvillUiltion of Revelle Requirements 

Um! from rum 
whim wam, frim fram 

grunion grease! 
Words: 

What do They mean to you? 
M ethods, 

Ways to do things? 
Education, 

A method of using words to communicate knowledge? 

How many different ways ar~ there to feel a word? 

To, Sue,lor an instance, I might say 
describing the way we feel as gay 

"gay" Sue, you say to us, "Stay away 
I know what you are by what you say 

and what you are is not okay 
from what I've been taught by societay." 

Wait a minute Sue we haven't communicated 

I was saying that we, as a group, 
feel happy - whatever that means 

I was speaking as a member 
of this group. Perhaps 

you can 't feel what I mean 
by gay . And perhaps 

you can't judge a group's feelings 
by what one individual says. And perhaps 

you can't use a predefined term 
to denounce our grOUD - etc. 

Education is a process by which people learn . A cont inual process 
in which questions are best answered by asking other questions 
Things are always changing in order to survive. If people accept 
knowledge as something which is done to them and b lieve they 
have been educated once they receive their degree, then they fact' 
extinction just as thousands of plants and animals which could not 
adapt to an evolutionary env ironment . 1) ren-ais-sance - (noun) is a 
word which means re-again - rebirth naissance-bi rth - begin to grow, 
2) Renaissance - (proper noun) is a period in time in which there was 
a revival of learning - a change; 3) " Renaissance Men" - is what 
Revelle College wants to make of it's students ... male and female; 

To put the matter simply, educat ion at Revelle is not evolving, it is 
not prodUCing "Renaissance"people. The fact that Revelle's curricula 
has not been critically evaluated since the conception of Revelle 
vindicates our position. This stagnation has very serious 
ramifications. We need to change as everythin g else does. We must 
realize that learning in a truly renaissance fashion means a change in 
behavior - a new way of doing things, of perceiving, of learning. But 
how do we attempt to become renaissance people? 

First, we must realize that change is necessary. We must confront 
new si tuations with new modes of thinking. We need to learn about 
learning. 

Se ond, we must communi ate our new feelings to each other as 
equals With one objective in mind-learning. We should continue to 
use old methods of interpreting words to argue one point against 
another . We should be able to go beyond the old methods to delve 
into a deeper understanding of each other . 

Third, we must plan together. Teachers, student and professors 
together must begin to look at learning as something which is not 
donI" to a person , but someth ing which people do together .

Counter-Revolutionary 
The fact that there was room in Monday's "Triton Times" for 

Montgomery Reed's interminable paranoid egoist blatherings con-
cerning an alleged rightist slant in the reporting on that monumental 
triviality, the Student Coop, is a sorry commentary on the column and 
quality of student contributions to the editorial page. 

I must admit that I am impressed by Reed's ability to string together 
words into grammatically correct English sentences, an ability which 
was no doubt fostered by his profound studies in "communication 
arts." However, language should be used for the purpose of expressing 
worthwhile ideas, and thus should do more than reflect one's personal 
inadequacies and paranoid delusions. Neither Adolph Hitler nor 
Montgomery Reed, nor others like them undj!rstand that. As Em~rson 
once put it, " Hitch your blather to a brain!" 

It would be unfair to suggest that Reed makes no intelligible points 
at all in his tirade . At great length he manages to make the obvious 
point that no reportage can, in a strict sense, be truly objective. He 
then draws the remarkable conclusion that newspapers should sub-
scribe to the concept of "advocacy journalism as th only honest form 
of journalism." It is hard to see what he means by this. It is unlikely 
that Reed would be delighted if the next edition of the "Triton Times" 
carried a two-i nch high banner headline, MONTOMERY REED SHITS. 

More seriously, "objectivity in reporting," properly taken, means 
being modest and fair enough to include facts and perceptions that 
may seem to conf li ct with one's own beliefs and prejudices . A sincere 
allegiance to this principle would never make any newspaper, whether 
the Daily Worker or the San Diego Union, any the worse. " Advocacy 
journalism" is apparently the latest euphemism for "propaganda": the 
conscious selection and presentat ion of those facts or mis-facts that 
will serve to promote a certain belief or emotional bias. 

I personally consider myself a staunch advocate of socialist 
revo lution in the Th ird World, and of greater domestic equality . It is 
precise ly because of this that I am offended by the sort of "advocacy 
journali sm" sometimes engaged in by the " North Star" and other 
radical papers. Such journalism is so blatant in its selectivity of the 
facts that it ultimately only convinces those who are already true 
believers or those who are insecure enough to need a True Belief, while 
reinforci ng conservative impressions of radicals as emotionalist and 
Illogical. It is therefore profoundly COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY. 

I do not wish to imply that Reed would knowingly exclude facts in 
his writings. People like Montgomery Reed are obviously so self· 
righteous that they are incapable of appreciating any argument or 
believing any fact that runs counter to whatever fetishist idea or 
program they are presently propping their fai ling egos up with . I hope 
that Reed will come to accept this point and save the world several 
decades of anguish by taking a stro ll off the top of Urey Hall. I n the 
event that he should fail to implement this suggestion, the Student 
Cooperative and other concerned students should take steps, including 
perhaps lawsuits and also "extralegal " means if needed, to suspend his

student had been accused of violating certain 
residence hall regulations and his case was finally 
given to the Judiciary committee for a final hearing 

The judiciary Committe ~as been brought back

who feels he hasn't had a fair shake is encouraged 
to contact the Dean's office for further information . 

Yesterday the Muir College Council IMt3!)

film presentation tomorrow 
when Sunshine Daydream, a 
movie about the Grilteful Dead, 
will be shown twice, at 8 and 10 
pm. The ticket price will be 
51 .50. 

Filmed in Oregon at a benefit 
lor Ken Kesey's dairy in Eugene, 
the movie features the Dead 
plilying music reminiscent of 
performances when the Deild 
were the Kesey-Ied Merry 
Pranksters house band . 

Filmmakers Frank Gallagher, 
Jim Houghton and Jim Barbier 
then took the benefit footage 
and intercut it with old footage 
of the Merry Prilnksters doing 
their thing on a cross-counlry 
bus trip ten years ago. 

The activities of the Merry 
Pranksters, for those unfamiliar 
with them , are detailed in Tom 
Wolfe'S The Electric Kool-Aid 
Acid Test. Kesey, the Dead and 
the merry Pranksters all got 
together in the mid'peninsula 
area around Palo Alto-Stanford 
in the middle 19605. The film 
should give students of the 
Dead in 1975 some idea of the 
way it was in the beginning, 

For example, there's a clip of 
infamous prankster Neal Cassidy 
driving the " magic" bus to the 
sounds of the Dead playing " I
