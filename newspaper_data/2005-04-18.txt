RIAA waits on student 
names in music lawsuits 

8, VLADIMIR KOGAN 
News Editor 

T he presiding federal judge has 
not yet signed off on subpoenas 
eeking to link IP add res es to spe-

cific UCSD students, meaning that 
recording companies and students 
must wait to learn the identities of 
the 25 defendants charged in last 
week's file-sharing lawsuits. 

"We don't know the students' 
names yet," Recording Industry 
Association of America spokesman 
jonathan Lamy aid. "We will be 
going to court soon to request 
permission to issue the subpoenas, 
but that has not happened, or at 
least that request has not yet been 
approved." 

An April 15 route trace to the 25 
IP addresses listed in the 434-page 
suit showed that 15 of the addresses 
were assigned to current ResNet 
accounts. The remaining addresses 
were unassigned, and led to comput-
ers that were either not on during 
the trace or were assigned to a proxy 
server used by off-<:ampus residents. 

According to Academic 
Computing Service Director Tony 
Wood, the campus' IP addresses 
are dynamic - meaning that they

change approximately every 30 days 
- so the current accounts assigned 
to the addresse Ii ted in coun doc-
uments may not necessarily rep-
resent the defendants in the suit. 
To po itively identify the students, 
the RlAA will need to subpoena 
ResNet records listing the identities 
of students assigned to the addresses 
on the specific times and dates the 
recording companies allege students 
engaged in copyright infringement. 

uch subpoenas have not yet 
been issued. 

"We haven't heard a peep out 
of anyone, as far a I know," Wood 
said. 

However, five students with 
ResNet accounts that are currently 
assigned to the IF addresses listed 
in the suit told the Guardian they 
were among the roughly 50 people 
who have received RIM subpoe-
na warnings since january. They 
agreed to speak on the condition of

Strike hits res. halls, eateries 
8, AMY IFURUNG 

Staff Writer 

In respon e to deadlocked 
negotiations with the University 
of California, the American 
Federation of State, County and 
Municipal Employees Local 3299 
held a statewide one-day strike on 
Apri l 14, leavin g residence halls 
without cu todians and food facili-
ties understaffed . 

"It's not about shutting down 
the campus, it's about showing that 
we're united," said AFSCME 3299 
organizer j essica Lopez, a 2002 
john Muir College graduate. 

Service workers picketed at 
eight UC campuses and five uni-
versity-run medical centers across 
the state, despite the university's 
conclusion that the strike was in 
violation of the law. 

Negotiations between the uni-
versity and the union are in a peri-
od of state-mandated impasse and 
disruption of these proceedings 
by the strike has been considered 
illegal by the university. 

"The University of California 
believes this strike is not only unlaw-
ful . .. but also clearly demonstrates 
bad-faith bargaining by the union, , 
UC spokesman Noel Van Nyhuis 
tated in a university press release.

Bill would raise immigrant tuition 
A.S. resolution urges lawmakers to oppose plan 

University drops plans 
for U --House rebuilding 
Campus failed to raise $7.2 mil. 
needed to replace current house 

By PA11tICK ALLEN 
Senior Staff Writer 

Earlier this month, the A.S. 
Council unanimously approved a 
resolution opposing a proposed 
amendment to the state con titu-
tion that would prohibit officials 
from providing in-state tuition to 
undocumented workers and stu-
dents, in addition to other benefits. 

The amendment, introduced by 
Assemblyman Mark Wyland (R-Del 
Mar), would permanently change 
the Illegal Immigration Reform and 
llrunigrant Responsibility Act of 
1996, a law restricting the amount 
of benefits that undocumented 
immigrants can receive from the 
tate. The 1996 statute still allowed 

the state to provide undocumented 
immigrants the same higher educa-
tion benefits available to out-of-
state tudents. 

Revelle College enior Senator 

Ted McComb submitted the AS 
resolution, saying that the undocu-
mented pe.rsons affected by the leg-
islation are contributing members of 
California's society and t:conomy. 

"It's a matter of justice," 
McCombs said. "These undocu-
mented families are not just resi-
dents of California. They form 
an integral pan of the California 
economy - like it or not, our 
economy benefits greatly from 
tile exploitation of undocumented 
migrant labor . . . . It is only fair that 
we provide the basic oppommity 
for a university education to those 
undocumented students who are 
academically eligible." 

ccording to Wyland, however, 
the illegal ilTunigr-ants are a drain on 
the economy, costing the state more 
than $10 billion in 2004 alone. 

"Like most Californians, I sup-
pon limited and reasonable legal 
immigration," Wyland stated in an

Plans to rebuild University 
House have been canceled because 
campus administrators have failed 
to raise enough money to fund the 
$7.2 million project, despite a six-
month effort. 

T he project was commis ioned 
by the University of California 
Office of the President and pro-
posed to demolish the existing 
University House, which erves as 
the home of the U CSD chancellor, 
in order to build a new residence 
on the La Jolla Farms property. 

U COP Co mmuni ca ti ons 
Director Paul chwartz stated in an 
e-mail that C SD administrators 
were unable to meet the project 
fund -raising goal because of other 
competing funding priorities. 

"In general, some donor gifts 
are designated for specific purpose, 
while others aren't and are given in 
general suppon of the univer ity's 
needs, which can include building 
projects," Schwartz stated. 

Because of the cancell ation , 
Vice Chancellor of Exte rn al 
Relations James M. Langley has 
di olved the fund - raising task 
force set up to eek out donor , 
according to the project' building 

advi ory committee member and 
anthropology professo r Donald 
T uzin . 

However, T uzin said, members 
of the building advisory committee 
that oversee the construction will 
reconvene to explore other hous-
in g options before maki ng another 
proposa l to UCOP. 

"There are a lot of options we can 
look into," T uzi n said. "We could try 
to repair the· current house or sub-
divide the sileo nomer option is to 
selJ the property and build the house 
elsewhere." 

Ithough chwartz would not 
reveal how close UCS D adminis-
trators ca me to reaching the fund-
raisi ng goal, he did state that no 
actual money was given to the proj-
ect. 

"For these types of projects, 
oftenti mes the C wi ll first obtain 
verbal commi tments from donors, 
and then only collect acwa l funds 
once we know we have the needed 
amount," he ta ted. "In this case, 
since the total amount needed for 
tile project wa n 't secured , no funds 
were acmally received."

House: UCOP promises to 
to pay for alternative plan 

conrinued from page I 
a residence in close proximity to 
campus. UCOP previously com-
nutted to donating money -
approximately $1 nlillion - to the 
Umversity House project, and it is 
expected to provide a portion of the 
funding needed for any upcoming 
proposals, according to Schwartz. 

"UCOP expects to make a 
colltribution from non-state 
resources, but a final number has 
not yet been settled on," Schwartz 
stated. 

A report commiss;oned by UC 
President Robert C. Dynes last 
summer deemed tile house unin-
habitable. In addition, the report 
revealed that the University 
Ii ouse property, valued at $12 

mi ll ion, holds ancient archaeo-
logical remains. 

"Any upcoming project will 
have to i nvol ve a survey on the 
archeological character of the 
property, but that obligation wi ll 
be on the new owner [if the prop-
erty is sold]," Tuzin said. 

Fox will continue to live in 
a $6,500-per-mollth rented resi -
dence in downtown La Jolla, 
funded by UCOP, until perma-
nent housing becomes available. 

Langley, who spearheaded the 
loca l fund-raising drive, was out 
of the office and unavailable for 
comment.

Proposition 187, sponsor says 

continued from page I 
the proposed amendments, these 
students would be ineligible to 
receive any form of state as is-
tance, including resident tuition 
or financial aid . According to 
Wyland's chief of staff, Duane 
Dichiara, no "illegal immigrant" 
should be in coll ege because 
they are taking away spots from 
"California students." 

McCombs, however, did not 
agree with Dichiara's assessment. 

"Last time I checked, eligibility 
for a UC education did not depend 
on how much in taxes you payor 
your green card status," McCombs 
said. "It depends solely on academic 
standards, and if an undocumented 
Cali forma resident performs better 
than a U.S. ci tizen, then I have no 
problem with that undocumented 
student taking that pot." 

T hough Dichiara said that 

a final vote on the legislation is 
unlikely - due to a block by the 
Democ.ratic majority in the state 
Legislarure - but an approval of 
the amendment could spark ques-
tions about its constitutionality. 

In 1994, California voters passed 
Proposition 187, which denied heaim 
care, education and welfare benefits 
to illegal immigrants. In 1998, how-
ever, the federal courts declared me 
majority of the act unconstitutional . 
In me ruling,Judge Mariana pfaelzer 
said that the state government did 
not have the authority to set imn1.i-
gration policy. 

Despite this precedent, Dichiara 
said that the amendment is consti-
tutionally sound and mat he hopes 
that the issue will be debated and 
mat a vote wi ll be scheduled.

Newspa~er alleges 
vandalism in campaign 

The Dotly Nexus, a daily student 
newspaper at UC Santa Barbara, has 
said that more than 300 copies of its 
paper were defaced with 'election pro-
paganda" in the last days of the school's 
annual Associated Students election. 

Last week, employees of the paper 
found red stamps on its front page 
urging voters to support the Student 
Action Committee, one of the parties 
running candidates in the election. 
In an issue printed the day before 
the vandalism was discovered, the 
paper's endorsements did not back 
any of the executive candidates run-
ning with the party. 

Posing as an interested student, 
an employee of the paper also used 
a disposable camera to document the 
nearby presence of a red stamp simi-
lar to those used to mark the paper. 

The party's presidential candidate 
said members of his slate were not 
involved with the vandalism . 

The campus' police department is 
investigating the matter. The paper's 
editor in chief, Daniel Haier, estimated 
that the defaced copies were valued 
at approximately $640. 

Report backs increased 
distance education 
In a third-annual report on dis· 

tance-education programs, the U.S. 
Department of Educal10n has called on 
federal lawmakers to ease regulations 
for students wishing to study without 
on-campus instruction. The changes 
could result in a significant increase 
in access to higher education for low-
income students, the report concluded. 

Under current regulation, colleges 
must comply with the so-called "50· 
percent rule; which requires schools 
to meet specific requirements in order

to qualify for federal financial aid. The 
colleges must provide at least half of 
their classes onsite and have no more 
than half of their students enrolled in 
distance-education programs such as 
online classes or telecourses. 

In recent months, Republican lead-
ers in the House of Representatives 
Education 'and the Workforce 
Committee have proposed eliminat-
ing the regulations. 

The report urges lawmakers to 
expand the current demonstration 
program, which allowed 24 schools 
to waive the 50-percent rule, to cover 
100 sdiools. 

The report also called on leg-
islators to eliminate these regula· 
tions, including the 50·percent rule, 
in their reauthorization of the Higher 
Education Act. 

Report: Universities 
spent millions to lobby 

Despite a series of budget cuts in 
states throughout the country, public 
colleges and universities have spent 
more than $100 million on lobbying 
efforts in the nation's capital in recent 
years, the Center for Public Integrity 
has reported. 

The nonprofit investigative journal-
ism organization reported that more 
than 300 universities have spent a 
total of at least $141.7 million on 
lobbyists in the past six years. The 
amount was more than twice the 
total spent by the 56 states and U.S. 
territories on similar efforts. 

However, Center for Governmental 
Studies President Bob Stem told the 
organization that the public entities had 
more to lose than the money saved by 
cutting lobbying out of their budgets. 

Without such efforts, "the federal 
government screws the states, the 
states screw the counties, and the 
cities and counties don't have any 
money left," the organization quoted 
Stem as saying. 

Gene heals 'skin' in 
fruit flies, mammals 

UCSD biologists and colleagues 
have discovered evidence suggesting 
that the gene responsible for the regen-
eration of insect cuticle - the outer 
layer of the body surface in insects - is 
also responsible for similar processes in 
mammals. The findings, they reported, 
could lead to new insights on medical 
techniques for the healing of wounds 
and treatment of cancer. 

Published last week in the jour-
nal Sa'ence, their study identifies the 
'grainyhead" master ~ene they say 
activates repair genes In cells near an 
injury in the embryos of fruit flies . 

The study was paid for by grants

Suits: IP addresses linked to 15 accounts 
continued from pal[C I 

anonymiry so that their comments 
could not be used as evidence 
against them in the case. 

In documents filed with the 
Southern California federal dis-
triCI court, recording companies 
accu e the 25 "John Doc" defen -
dants of illegally sharing between 
three and five songs each, in viola-
tion of federal copyright law. The 
ongs listed in the documents vary 

in genre and artist, ranging from 
Marvin Gaye's "Sexual Healing" 
and hania Twain 's "Man

' 
[ Feel 

Like A Woman" to Outkast's 
"Gangsta Shi t" and Eminem's 
"I'm Back." Radiohead and Red 
Hot Chili Peppers made the most 
appearances on the list. 

Peter L. Wucetich, one of two 
attorneys from an Lrvine-based law 
firm representing the recording 
companies, declined to comment. 

"I just hope this doesn't hap-
pen," aid an Earl Warren College 
sophomore whose current IP 
address was listed in the suit. "I 
JUSt hope it's a bluff." 

The student, who has 1,937 
hared songs, said he has already 

uninstalled his pecr-to-peer oft-
ware in a deal witll ResNet after 
being notified of a subpoena 
warning issued for his account 
several weeks ago. 

"Otherwise, lhey would have 
taken my [nternet away and [ 
would've been screwed," he sa id . 
"It was a do-or-die si tuation ." 

Another Warren sophomore 
with a matching IP address said he 
notified nis parents after receiving 
the subpoena warning and has 
contacted a n attorney for hel p. 
However, like the omer students, 
he said he has received no formal 
letter or notice officially serving 
him with the lawsuit. 

"I'm obviously going to have to 
pay for it," he said. "1 don't know 

how I'm going to do it - [ don't 
have any money." 

The suit asks for unspecified 
damages, requesting the court to 
reimburse the recording compa-
nies for court costs and attor-
ney fees and grant them per-track 
damages for each song shared. 
Under federa l law, me fi ne for 
each song can range between $750 
and $30,000. 

However, in an online press 
conference wim college news-
papers, RIM President Cary 
Sherman told reporters the indus-
try has settled most of the suits for 
an amount that averages between 
$3,500 and $4,500, as long as the 
defendants acted cooperatively. 

"Suffice it to say that this is 
not a profi t-making venture," 
Sherman said , explaining that 
the suits were necessary to "edu-
cate" the public about tile illegal 
nature and risks of file sharing. 
"If we have to litigate the case, or 
if the infringement is especially 
egregious, the settlement amount 
could be higher." 

A Revelle Coll ege sophomore 
whose IP was listed in the suit said

When the 
DAY of 

is observed in a cursory manner, 
the gay rights movement suffers 

By MARIANNE MADDEN 
, Opinion Editor 

L ast Wednesday, a girl srood on the path leading to Srudent Center, madly text-
messaging on her ce ll phone. J t 
was a normal sight, except she 
wore a black Day of Silence T-
shin and undoubtedly had a back-
pack sruffed full of cards explain-
ing how she had taken a vow of 
si lence "to recognize and protest 
the discrimination and harass-
ment - in effect, the si lencing 
- experienced by LGBT srudem s 
and their allies," according to the 
event's official manrra on Imp:// 
dOJofl'ilenu.org. 

Props to the girl, and everyone 
el e, who observed the day around 
campus and across the nation. Bur 
- text messaging whil e observi ng 
3 day of si lence' Does anythi ng 
seem odd in this picrure? 

Replacll1g one form of com-
munication (verbal speech) with 
JIlorher - say, text messagi ng or 
II1stant me saging or good old-
fashIOned note-writing - rurns 
the day from a poignant reminder 
of discrimination to a slight incon-
venience. 

Text messaging stems Out of 
a constant need to communicate; 
that much is obvious. But the fact 
that it isn't noisy doesn't make it 
an appropriate feature of a day 
of sil ence. It completely misses 
the spirit of the day, cheapens 
the experience of actually being 
silenced and does a disservice to 
all the queer youth around the 
world who really are intimidated 
Into not speaking up - the very 
people who need an evenr like this 
to bring their plight to the public 
consciousness. Will a closeted gay 
srudent in middle America, bul-
lied inro silence and made to feel 
ashamed of his sexual orientation 
by everyone in his life, "break the 
si lence" by simply text messaging 
his classmates, teachers, parents 
and pastor? Can he send them 
an e-mail with the subject line, "I 
know you said homosexuality was 
an abomination, but ... "? Should 
he write them a note, or make up a 
batch of posters at Kinko's' 

Our oppressed student won 't 
do any of these things. If he did, he 
wouldn't be silenced. In reality, the 
si lence and despair wrought upon 
LGBT youth is - o r at least can 
be - startling in its totality. 

Thi totality, this com plete lack 
of em powerment, was what the 
creator of the Day of Silence 
sought to caprure through obser-
"'lIlce of the event. It's a shame 
that on campuses around the coun-
try, sci f-righteous youths instead 
paraded around in black, keeping 
their mouths sh ut but their lines of 
communication wide, wide open. 
Surely if these students were asked 
the poim of the event, they would 
have a long-winded answer, their 
holier- than-thou attitude shin -
IIlg through. They must have no 
memory of the days when students 
who observed the event would 
li ve mlllely the whole day, i olated 
from their friend ancl teacher, 

grasping what it feels like to be 
bullied into such an utter silence 
that your friends and family are 
completely unaware of a major 
facet of your identity. Or maybe 
they just decided that being si lent 
is too hard when they 
simpl y mllst convey to 
their friends where 

for peoples' mouths at $5 a pop), 
but it's already been downgraded 
from a major hassle (the point of 
the whole event) to a minor incon-
venience. "Can't talk today," count-
less people must have text messaged 

to thei r best buds 

" 
they're meeting for 
IUl1ch. 

Sure, it's a purist 
interpretation of how 
the event should be 
observed. Anyone 
who's enjoyed choco-
late eggs on Easter 
or itting on anta's 
lap at Christmas can 
attest that many, if 
not all , holidays suffer 
the same fate. Ripped 
from their original aim 

.. . many supposed 
'allies' of the gay

decisions granting marriage equal-

The gay rights movement takes 

many of its cues from the civi l 
rights movement, and now is the 
time to take another one: Fight the 
battles at the legislative level. Each 
amendment defining marriage as 
strictly heterosexual is another nail 
in the coffin of the gay rights 
movement and another rallying 
cry for the opposition. The cries 
of the entire LGBT movement are 
being drowned out by loud procl a-
mations that " the sanctity of mar-
riage must be preserved." Anti-
gay-marriage amendments are just 
like the Jim Crow laws of the 
civil rights movement: Abolishing 
these laws is the first step, because

Converse 
wearers 

bond 
together 

Don't forget 
the joker 

Cody Nabours 

I t seems that everywhere you rurn these days you see them. Clean, smootll white rubber, 
unmarred inky black canvas and 
the unmistakable black stripe at the 
toecap; these are the Converse of 
the po cur. No ,,,hite circle witll tile 
signarure blue star, for the poseur 
will only wear low-tops. And clean , 
like the teeth of daytime televi-
sion, for the poscur feeds excill-
ively upon the steri lized, harajukll 

model of rebelli on conslimerism-
meets-high-fashi on. T he days of 
the Converse as an outward sign 
of coolness are over. The Conver e 
C huck Taylor is ubiquitous and 
universal and is once again the 
staple of the American youth, the 
hoe for every man , woman and 

child of toda y. 
Once, not too long ago, if twO 

wearing Conver e happened to 
come acros!> each other in public, 
an instinctive bond \Va ' formed, an 
unspoken understanding from one 
to the other of mutual respect and 
recognized coolness. Regardless of 
race, gcnder, relative attractiveness, 
shoe style and color, the onver!>c 
was a badge of allegiance to tile 
llndergrowld world of marijuana and 
rock 'n' roll, where i!,'1lorancc was 
rewarded with arcasm and pop cul-
ture was appreciated as art or irony, 
never entertainment. But no longer. 
Every good underground society of 
like-minded cool people eventually 
becomes too cool for its own good 
and makes a blip on the screens of 
the mainstream, and suddcnly its 
members can no longer tell thei r 
own from the masses of people just 
realizing how cool it is to look like 
them. 

This poses a problem to those 
who once proudly wore Converse, 
for it forces the pop-culrure etho 
of, "If it's popular, it fucking sucks," 
to rurn its hateful gaze toward the 
shoe of punk rock, the shoe tha t so 
famously tapped out the count-in 
in the "Smells Like Teen Spirit" 
video, the shoe that always split on 
the sides just when it got comfort-
able, that got torn from repeated 
ollies, that induced the feeling of 
floating afte r a day's work in clunky 
regular shoes. Converse shoes are 
too dear to be cast aside because 
of some petty hatred of the main-
stream; there have been too many 
memories soaked into their canvas, 
and their history is too big to bury. 
Let those who wore Converse con-
tinue to wear Converse, and teach 
each other how to spot the phonics 
in their midst. Remember, people 
that wear Converse are no longer 
automatically all right, fo r not all 
of them o'uly respect tile instirution 
of the hoe, the history that lives on 
in cach worn down, torn lip, sweaty 
pair of Converse. 

A bassist I know, a foll ower of 
the punk-rock school, and, until 
recently, a Converse owner (he has 
chosen to follow his va lues, Ilis-
tory be damned), recounts the pur-
chase of his first pair. Takcn by hi 
mother to the store, he was allowed 
to purchase either black high-tops 
or white high-tops, the only "tTUe"

Silence: LGBT movement needs dedication 
continued from page 4 

so prom.ising throughout the '80s 
and '90s. 

Surely it doesn 't help that, if the 
Day of Silence is any indication, 
many supposed "allies" of the gay 
rights movement supply lip service 
instead of actual passion. On most 
college campuses, professing to be 
for gay rights is cool and it's hi p, 
and not appearing in support of the 
cause is seen as backward. 

But fighting for gay rights is, 
sadly, not 'as simple as giving up 
speaking in favor of cell phone text 
messaging, just like fighti ng for 
civil rights gains was not as simple 
as refusing to give up one's seat 
on the bus. It is complicated and 
messy; it is signing petitions,lobby-
ing representatives, wri ting letters, 
embracing collective action, raising 
money, raisi ng hell. It is behind-
the-scenes grunt work, not just 

trendy, highly visible, minimally 
taxing protest. 

So if the participants in the Day 
of Silence want to make a differ-
ence, they should consider drop-
pi ng the ho lier-than-thou attitudes 
and the cell phones, band together, 
and make some noise. Standing 
aloof and clinging to one's black T-
shirt while the gay rights movement 
loses ground will doom the entire 
cause in a few short years.

Column: 
Converse now 

a symbol of 
coolness 
continued from page 4 

Converse, since they were the only 
colors available when he was a girl. 
More colors were implemented in 
1966, one year shy of the shoe's 50th 
anniversary, the same year as Bob 
Dylan's BlllIule em Blonde, possibly 
the best rock 'n' roll album of all 
time. Before that, it had been the 
sneaker of the American youth (at 
least according to '., Iappy Days"), 
and the all-white variety became 
immensely popular with American 
soldiers during World War II. 
Let's not forget that people wore 
these things for basketball, either. 
Since then, iconic, inarguably cool 
Americans have worn the sneak-
ers. (A random sampling includes 
Ferris BueHer, Snoop Dogg, Bruce 
Springsteen, and, oh, Marty McFly.) 
When his mother bought my bud-
ding punk friend his first Converse, 
the torch was passed; nearly a cen-
tury of American history, the lives of 
generations of Americans, sat there 
in a box thick with the stinging odor 
of fresh, virgin rubber. Converse 
are the Adidas for the white folk. 
This history cannot be taken lightly. 

1uch like the Chevy Corveue or 
the Fender tratocaster, Converse 
shoes are wholly, irrevocably, quint-
essentially American, and 1 hope, at 
the very least, aU the recent initiates 
to the shoe (not the cool) can under-
stand and respect th.at. 

However, much like the "pre-
CBS buyout" Stratocaster that 
so aroused Wayne Campbell of 
"Waynes World" (a Converse wear-
er) are the torn-up Converse that 
sit on your feet - that is, if you 
got them before July 2003, when 
the company was swallowed by the 
Nike-East India Company. But by 
the time of Converse's bankruptcy 
two years earlier, the shoes were 
being made in the United States 
no longer, but rather in factories 
throughout Asia. Appreciate the 
shoes on your feet, because if you 
buy new Converse, you are placing 
money in the hands of the Great 
Satan. When you see the torn Chuck 
Taylors on the feet of your fellows, 
know that the bond you share is that 
of the final generation of Converse-
wearers uncorrupted by corporate-
spon ored cool. All those who we3r 
fresh-out-of-the-box, squeaky clean 
Converse, they are the automatOns, 
the salesmen for American imperial-
ism. 

With the image of Converse, 
ike has concocted tile identity 

f rebellion to sell to the masses, 
based on nearly a century of clas-
sic American cool. The problem, 
which is always (or never) forgot-
ten by the Freon-blooded corporate 
types, is that once you market the 
underground to the masses, it can 
no longer be cool. This is the vicious 
cycle that keeps culture moving for-
ward like a shark. Because of it, it 
is no longer all right to purchase 
Converse, for the Sa me reason ' hate 
anyone who eats McDonald's. The 
great sneaker of the 20th century sits 
on your feet today and is the link to 
the legacy of that generation, a leg-
acy we must all remember. Perhaps 
another generation will make the 
shoe cool again in eight to 10 years, 
but most likely it will be lost to the 
history books, a victim of Nike's evil 
powers. 

Don't mind the poseurs who 
wear brand-new Converse - they 
have already been lost to the dark 
side. Just be sure to keep your di -
tance. You, wear your Converse with 
pride: theJack Purcells (my very first 
Converse), the Chuck Taylors, the 
Dr. Js and the One Stars. Rock the 
20tll century lest we forget all about 
it. But 21 st century Converse, get 
outra my hou e; this is no bordello.

Strike: University calls demands unreasonable 
cominued from page I 

for almost 18 hours around the 
perimeter of the university. Days 
in advance, flyers doned the cam-
pus urging students to support the 
protest and contact UC President 
Robert C. Dynes and UCSD 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox con-
cerning the union's demands. 

Assistant Vice Chancellor of 
Human Resources Rogers Davis 
issued a letter to students and fac-
ulty before the strike began prom-
ising that the university was doing 
all it could to find a solution. 

"While the parties have not yet 
reached agreement on a contract, it is 
the university's intention to continue 
working with the AFSCME repre-
sentative to arrive at an agreement," 
Davis stated in the leuer. 

The union held a two-hour 
rally in the afterno n in front of 
Gilman Parking Structure. During 
the rally, service workers and their 
supporters spoke out in support of 
the union's goals. 

"Ir's been too long since people 
that do the jobs that we do have been 
recognized," Earl Warren College 
b'TOWldskeeper Gabe Gonzalez said. 
"It's our intention to maintain the 
highest quality of service." 

peeches were spoken intermit-
tently in both English and Spanish, 
due to the large number of Mexican 
and Latino employees. 

"We just want a raise ," 
Thurgood Marshall College cus-
todian Josefina Gonzales said. "A 
lot of US can't pay our bills and 
we're tired . That's why we're here 
- we're tired ." 

The rally also gathered support-
ers from other university-affiliated 
unions and various student orga-
nizations. 

"As students, we need to stand 
together wi th our service workers 
and show them that we're here 
united," A.S. President-elect and 
current Commissioner of Diversity 
Affairs Christopher Sweeten said. 

Eleanor Roosevelt College 
senior Cara Dessert, a student 
representing both Students for 
Economic Justice and Queer 
People of Color, said she considers 
the treatment of service workers to 
be partially due to race. 

"Many of the people who choose 
this job as their career are Mexican , 
and they'll go 10 years without a 
raise," Dessert said. "Then a white

AFSCME 3299 represents 
more than 7,000 service workers 
employed by the University of 
California, including groundskeep-
ers, custodians and building-main-
tenance workers. 

The union, which has been in 
negotiations with the university 
over a new contract for almost a 
year, is asking for across-the-board 
increases every six months and a 
20-percent wage increase over the 
next three years. 

The university called the wlion's 
demands "financially unrealistic" due 
to the confines created by the state 
budget. In order to comply with the 
lillion, the university said it would 
face costs in excess of $36 million. 

"The university has offered rais-
es for service workers predicated 
upon the budget compact with the 
governor, which provides increased 
salary funding over the next several 
years," Van Nyhui said. 

The university is schedu led to 
meet with the union on April 18 in 
response to the protest.

Hip-hop: More than music, hip .. hop offers a philosophy by which to live 
continued from page 8 

Spades, Bambaataa transformed the 
other members into positive influ-
ences in the community. Inspired 
by the Zulu warriors of Africa, 
Bambaataa established Zulu ation, 
a group of politically and racially 
conscious B-boy (break dancers), 
rappers and graffiti artists. This new 
lifestyle spread outside its original 
circle into popular culrure, evolving 
into today's influential subculrure of 
hip-hop. 

Even today, rap is seldom heard 
at hip-hop "jams," or gatherings. 
The vital distinction between rap 
and hip-hop i stres cd by any-
one who is truly involved in the 
culture. As said by legendary rap-
per KRS-One, "Rap is something 
you do, hip-hop is something you 
live." 

Second to music, hip-hop enthu-
siasts often recognize B-boying as 
one of the oldest clements of hip-
hop. Breakdancing was spa rked in 
the 1970s as people began to dance 
to the "break," or the continuous 
back-and-forth looping of a drum 
or bass solo. 

Popularized in ew York in 
1975 by two feuding gang leaders, 
Apache and Rubber Band, B-boying 
was a method of peaceful "attack" 
against another person through 
dance moves that mimicked vi 'ent 
acts. During a "battle," two B-boys 
engage in dance moves, and if a 
particular move offends the dancer's 
opponent, it is considered a "bum." 
Based on the response of the audi-
ence, one dancer will defeat the 
other. 

An experienced B-boy and a 
member of L.I.F.E., McGhee began 
B-boying his fre Iunan year in col-
lege and soon started .. Bodyrock," a 
campus breakdancing club. B-boy-
ing is now an essential part of his 
daily life, he said. 

"1 have to do it every day," 

McGhee said. "It is something that 
has helped me out a lot in college. It 
is my creative outlet." 

Like b-boying, the initial pur-
pose of graffiti was to serve as a 
peaceful yet outspoken creative out-
let for gang members. The popular 
slang tenn "T.A.G.," used in refer-
ence to the act of creating graffiti, is 
acrually an acronym for Tuff Artists 
Group, the name of an early crew of 
graffiti artists. This visual element 
of hip-hop has spread a II a rollnd 
the world and continues to become 
more common among people who 
have no connection to gangs or 
crews of any sort. 

As the Illost marketable art-
ists of the culnlre, OJs and MCs 
have contributed the most to the 
popularization of hip-hop. A DJ's 
music and an Me's lyrics can eas-
ily be recorded and sold, while 
B-boys have no real way of selling 
their art other than by performing. 
Underground hip-hop slipped into 
the mainstream within a few yea rs 
due to recording artists such as DJ 
Grand Master Flash of the early 
19805. 

Eleanor Roosevelt College 
junior and adept OJ Larry Sun uses 
tile stage name DJ Predakon. While 
most hip-hop enthusiasts at UCSO 
relate to the B-boy aspect of the 
culmre, Sun seres es tile importance 
of DJs. 

"DJs are the backbone of hip-
hop," Sun said. "I lip-hop started 
with DJs doing street parties, th en 
rappers rapped to tllat, and then 
came tile break-dancers." 

For SW1, DJing is a method of 
expressing himself. 

" It's a way of taking some-
tiling and making it your own," 
Sun said. "There are no coaches. 
It's all you." 

Whether people arc conscious 
of it or not, hip-hop has left a mark 
on the dominant culture. Terms like 

graffiti, DJing and MCing are alJ 
understood in the lexicon of modem 
society. 

Revelle College senior Brian 
Leung, a srudent and member of 
LJ.F.E., agrees that hip-hop culrure 
is a positive influence on UCSD 
srudents. 

"1 would like to see more hip-
hop cu lrure at UCSD," Leung 
said. "But only for those who really 
appreciate it." 

While hip-hop's beginings a.re 
quite specific, the form ha now 
become a Iter~d and interpreted in 
a variety of ways. McGhee, Leung 
and Sun all agree that hip-hop serves 
as an outlet, an escape and a sense of 
relief from the stress of their college 
experience. 

"Hip-hop i a break from the 
mundane routine of everyday life," 
Lelmg said. 

But there is more to hip-hop 
than just escape. Used as tempo-
rary relief from daily stresses, hip-
hop also appeals to many people 
because of its versati li ty and lyriCiI 
power. ccording to L .l .F.E. mem-
bers, hip-hop musie is appropriate 
for parties and politics, anger and 
love, philosophy and dancing. Hip-
hop is flexible and able to match 
people's shifting moods. For them, 
hip-hop's poetic yet powerful Iyri-
cislll is able to make its messages 
clear while enforcing them with 
style. 

True hip-hop is not what it is 
cOlll lTlonly perceived to be. It is 
not the shallow, money-flaunting, 
misogynistic images that appear 
in music videos. rt is a peaceful 
method of combating an enemy. It 
is an outlet for self-expression. It 
cncompas es versatility and power. 
It requires dedication, appreciation 
and an open mind. As the Digable 
Planets attest, hip-hop is about los-
ing oneself, escaping, and cneating 
beauty.

FEATURES II 

UCSD offers understanding 
on global warming issues 

Models of global warming provide scientists 
with wealth of information, but no solution 

By LAURA CANTER 
Staff Writer 

UCSD, considered to be one 
of the most prestigious research 
institu tions in the countf)', has been 
acknowledged for its breakthrough 
research in global warming study 
thanks to some of the most dedi-
cated annospheric scientists in the 
fie ld. Most recentl)" research at 
UCSD has focused on changing 
weather patterns and the panicles 
and gradients affecting such chang-
es. In the ongoing debate on the 
causes of global cl imate changes, 
evidence found by these scientists is 
considered to be some of the most 
convinci ng. 

Conce rn over global wa rming 
dates back to Roger Revell e's dis-
covery of holV sea water controls 
the am OlLnt of carbon d ioxide and 
greenhouse gases in the atmo-
sphere. Revelle's discovery caused 
a massive reorganization wi thin the 
fields of environment and earth sci-
ences. Carbon dioxide in the atmo-
sphere contributes to global warm-
ing by making it morc difficult for 
solar radiation to escape into space, 
causi ng an increase in air poll ution 
and risi ng ea levels due to melt-
ing glaciers. Changes in weatller 
patterns and temperature in cert3in 
areas have also verified that th e 
temperature of the atmosphere has 
increased. The e problems are clue, 
in pan, to the emission of aerosols 
re leased from cars, trucks and coal-
burning power plants. Fossi l-fuel 
use in the United States is respon-
sible for more C02 emission than 

an)' other coun tf)', and though the 
amount of fossi l fuel is finite, there 
is sti ll plenty left to cause more 
irreversible damage to the arrno-
sphere. 

C harles David Keeling, a pro-
fessor at the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanograph)' and an expert (til 
the wa), carbon moves through the 
planet'S ecosystem, was the first to 
mea ure C02 in th e atmosphere 
on a continuous basis. I Ie first 
started meas uring amounts of C02 
in 1958, and the concemrariuns 
have increased consistently ever 
since. Researchers at UC 0 agree 
that Keeli ng's findings are alarl11 -
ing; they p rovide credible evidence 
that increased C02 coun ts may be 
re ponsible for the warming of the 
atmosphere. In addition , scienti_ ts 
agree that 02 is the most signifi -
ca nt man-made, controllable gas. 

At UCSD, researchers have 
concentrated on particles, or aero-
sols, in the atmosphere, and how 
they are distributed, tran ported 
and developed. Many people do 
nor consider the role of clouds and 
how they ca n contribute to global 
warming. 

"Clouds can act like a ther-
mostat and cool the atlJ1ospher~ 
or they ca n act like a blankel and 
warm 'the atmosphere," meteorol -
ogist and SIO professor Richard 
Somervi lle said. "Clouds can con-
tri Ilute to the greenhouse gas effect 
and cause the anno phere to warm 
lip even more."

cent of sunlight back to the sun 
while the E arth absorbs 
70 percent. Somerville has been 
involved in cloud research, which 
entails studying the microphysics 
of clouds by flying an airplane 
through a bank of clouds, mea-
suring te mpera ture, barometric 
pressure and humidi ty. T hese data 
are in turn used to measure wate r 
content, d istribution of particles 
and ice crystals to predict global 
warming effects . 

One further method of global 
warming research at UCSD is the 
collection of ke cores, taken from 
layers of ice some 30 fect deep 
that are more than 5,000 years old . 
By measuring the amount of C02 
trapped in bubbles in the ice, cien-
tiStS arc able to determine the C02 
content of the Earth's atmosphere 
during different time periods. 

"T hese studies show an increase 
in C02 levels in the ice between 
the Ice Age periods," SIO direc-
tor Charl es Kennel sa id. In addi-
tion to this, past research by SIO 
researchers J eff Severinghaus and 
J ohn Berger have concentrated on 
how the cli mate has changed in the 
past and how this knowledge can 
be used to determine the furu re of 
the envi ro nment. 

Mark Thiemcns, dean of the 
division of physical sciences and 
professor o f chemi try and bio-
chemistry at UC 0 , studies the 
effectS of global warming by cutting 
a 30-feet-deep snow pi t to look at 
climate change with high temporal 
resolu tion. Last year, he dug up 
27 tons of snow from the South 
Pole and analyzed samples to figure 
out the extent of change caused by 
C02 emission. T he purpo e of his 
research is to measure greenhouse 
gases from different regions on the 
globe to get an idea of how these 
areas affect o ne another. 

ATTENTION: 
FRESHMAN 

"The deeper the snow, the 
further back in time we get," 
Thiemens said. "We are trying to 
understand the whole planet. " 

An increase in the global tem-
peramre can also affect weather 
patterns. 

"As the average temperamre 
increases, rain moves up in alti -
tude," Kennel said. "Predicted for 
2050 or 2060, half o f the winter 

" We need to limit C02 
to twice ar three times 

the current level. " 
- 'Charles Kennel, SIO director 

snow pack will be gone in the 
Sierra N evada and snow will fa ll 
as rain." 

As this effect becomes more 
prevalent, the run-off in C alifornia 
will decrease with the depletion 
of the snow pack, requi ring major 
changes in the way the state man -
ages its wa ter and irrigation. 

ImprovementS in the accuracy of 
weather forecasting can be attrib-
uted to breakthrough research on 
cl imate's dependency on the thick-
ness of clouds - sometimes mea-
sured to the nearest micrometer 
- and how they ca n affect the 
atmosphere. 

"Working with cloud micro-
physics in incredi ble detai l ca n 
assist scientists in using clouds in 
weather pred icti on models instead 
of humidi ty levels to he lp forecast 
rai n," Som ervi lle said. 

Understanding how aerosols are 
uansported from one region to 
another can help scientists fur th er 
comprehend how these particles 

can affect different areas . The 
ocean, for example, has been exam-
ined in some areas and researchers 
have determined that the ocean 
temperature is increasing due to 
aerosols' greenhouse-gas influence. 
The presence of aerosols has led 
to a change in the biodiversity of 
plantS and has taken a toll on the 
health of the population. According 
to Thiemens, "60,000 people in the 
U.S. die every year from brea thing 
aerosols and particles." 

Global warming is a well -known 
and controversial issue; skeptics 
argue that research is lUlnecessary 
and that the time and money should 
go toward more relevant geological 
issues such as earthquake detection 
or oceanography. According to the 
experts at UCSD, however, global 
warming should not be ignored, nor 
can it affo rd to be. 

"The damage ha beeu done, 
but the longer people wait tc do 
something about it , the m o re 
severe it is going to get," Kennel 
sa id . "W e need to limit C0 2 to 
twice o r three times the current 
level." 

Somervi lle agrees that global 
warming is destructive. 

"It will increase the chance of 
drought years and the water we 
drink will be scarce because there 
wi ll be less snow," he sdid. 

Even though global warming 
research at UCSD and SIO is con-
sidered innovative, each expert fee ls 
that the re is still a long way to go 
before g lobal warming is ever con-
sidered to be under control. For 
now, some of the most advanced 
computer models avai lable are 
being used to assist researcher 
in collecting and exa mi ning data . 
T hese g lobal climate models wi ll 
help ienrists better understand 
the behavior of the atmosphere 
and the environment in terms of 
global warming.

Crew: Tritons' expectations 
high for WlRA Championships 

continued from page ,6 
"It was a littl e frustrati ng out on 

the wate r because we were having 
some technical difficulties, but we 
st ill ran a fast race," novice captain 
Joe Gram said . 

During the middle of the race, 
the team's coxswain, Shannon 
Oliver, had her microphone mal -
function. As a result , Gram was not 
able to effectively communicate 
with the back of the boat. 

"Even though we had some 
minor problems, we were still able 
to beat some big teams," G ram 
said . "W e started off in dead-last 
like usual , but once again we slow-
ly passed up all of the other crews 
and battled OCC for first." 

The novice eight-boat will have 
its final chance to beat its season 
rival, Orange Coast College, at the 
WIRA championship. 

"In the next two weeks, we 
are going to go over some strat-
egizing," Gram said. "And we are 
going to work with the varsity 
team in order to help push our-
selves a little bit more." 

With a good showing at the 
WlRA Championships , the varsity 
team would have a good chance 
of sending at least one boat to 
the National Finals in Worcheste r, 
Mass. There, the Tritons would 
race against some of the top Pac-
10 schools, including Stanford 
University. 

The team is led by head coach 
Mark D avis, who is at the end 
of his second year at UCSD. He 
ca me to UCSD after coaching at 
the University of Texas. 

"Our season has been a grea t 
success and we have come a long 
way this season thanks to Coach 
Davis," BravQsaid. "[H el has made 
us a much fas ter team. He h3 
showed us how to row more effi-
ciently and has taught us all of the 
technical aspects of the sport." 

The Tritons will have their 
chance to beat UC D avis at the 
WlRA Championships on Lake 
Natoma in Folsom, Calif., on April 
30. This represents the ream's last 
chance to qualify for the National 

Im~ tatio na l May 7 and May 8.

UCSD is hot for Regionals 

continued from page ,6 
standing. 

T he Tritons picked up their first 
win of the match ar No.3 doubles, 
with Oijala and Meister fighting off 
Daniel Elefant and Henri Landes 
for a 9-7 victory. At No.1 and No.2 
doubles, UCSD did not fare as well; 
Spector and Molden teamed up in 
the No. I spot, but were unable to 
defeat the Aggies' Michael Chin and 
Justin Garcia, losing 2-8. At No.2 
doubles, UC Davis' Casey McMakin 
and Jordan Combs defeated Swatt 
and Phan, 8-2, to put the Aggies up 
2-1 going into the singles line-up. 

UCSD won four singles matches, 
three of which ended up in three 
sets, to clinch the victory. At No. I 
singles, Swatt defeated Jayce Fitch, 
losing the first set, 4-6, before pow-

ering back for a convincing fi nal 
two sets, 6- 1, 6-3 . At No. 3 sin-
gles, Spector defeated Combs in 
a very close 6-7, 6-3, 6-4 victory, 
while Oijala, pl aying No. 4 singles, 
defeated Bastian Bartels in the onl y 
two-set victory for UCSD, 6-2, 6-1 . 
At No. 5 singles, Meister .defeated 
Elefant for the final UCSD win, 4-6, 
7-5,6- 1. 

Molden , at No. 2 singles, put up 
a good fight against Chin, narrowly 
losing the match, 7-5, 7-6, while 
McMakin defeated Will Phan at No. 
6 singles, 6-\, 4-6, 6-L 

Already having surpassed previ-
ous expecta ti ons, the T ri tons will 
try their hand at the NCAA Playoffs 
after taking on Cal Poly Pomona on 
Apri l 19 in their last home match of 
the season.

lars to Bakersfield . The alternates 
filled in seamlessly. 

"Since we're a big team, we're 
able to fill in for each other," soph-
omore Allison Legakis said . "Since 
these matches had to be made up 
Ithey had been rained out ear-
lier this season], some players that 
don't normally play got a chance 
to play and others got breaks. 
We're able ro work together and 
help each other out." 

Starting with doubles play, 
N o. 1 sophomore tandem 
Marsha Malinow and Kri sti n 
Bronowicki easily dispatched of 
rhe Roadrunners' duo Kati Lynott 
and Jenni fe r Pact, 8-2. Sophomore 
Liz Brown and freshman Justine 
Fonte, at the o. 2 spot, won 8-
5 over CSU Bakersfield's P atty 
Pfister and Marti Hoyt. Finally, 
sophomores Legakis and Tomo 
Noji romped to an 8-0 goose-egg 
victory over Brittany Albery and 
Mari ya Lein at the No.3 spot. 

Singles play proved just as 
successful for the T ritons. Every 
match was taken in straight sets, 
and no Roadrunner player won 
more than three games in total, 
starting at the top of the ladder, 
with Malinow taking a 6-1, 6-1 
vittory over Lynott. Bronowicki, 
at No.2, won, 6-0, 6-1, over 
Pfister. Pac t, Brown's opponent at 
No. 3, had to retire due to injury 
early in the match, with Brown 
leading 5-0. Fonte defeated Albery 
and Noji beat Hoyt by identical 
scores of 6-2 ,6-1 at the No. 4 and 
No.5 spots, respectively. Finally, 
Legalcis completed UCSD's sweep 
with a 6-2, 6-0 vi ctory at No. 6. 

"The coaches want US to use 
these matches to keep us sharp," 
Legakis said. "Even though they 
weren't important as far as impli-

cations, they were necessary, so 
(LaPlante] wanted us to concen-
tra te on focus. I think we were 
successful. " 

The T ri tons fi nished the season 
on a five-match win Streak and are 
the winners of seven of their last 
eight matches. They now await th e 
official announcement of the site 
at which Regionals will be held. 
According. to LaPlante, the team 
expects to host one of the two sites 
in the Western Rcgionals, with the 
other site at BYU-Hawaii , home to 
the top-ranked team in the coun -
try. The regional championships 
will be held from May 6 to May 8. 
T he top-rwo teams in the region 
will attend Division national 
Champi onships from May 12 to 
May 15, at a site to be determined . 

According to Legakis , the team 
wi II spend a lot of time on the 
track to work on conditioning and 
make sure it is in top shape. 

"We really need to make sure 
our concentration level is high 
throughout practices from now 
until then," Legakis said. "We 
can't afford to waste time, espe-
cially with no more matches left 
until then to help keep our mental 
games up." 

Last season, the Tritons made 
it to Regionals as well, but lost 
in Hawai i to H awai i-Hila, who 
went on to Nati onals. The teams, 
likel y to be seeded No. 2 and 
No. 3 in the region (No. 1 will 
likely be BYU-Hawaii), appear to 
be on another collision course at 
Regionals this season. By hope-
fully having secured home-court 
advantage, the Tritons should 
have the edge they need to make 
it to the next level. Hawaii -Hilo 
is ranked No. 12, and the Tritons 
defeated the Vulcans at home ear-
lier this season, 7-2 . 

continued from page ,6 
Rusch stepped up. Rusch, who had 
14 kills for the night, tagged UCLA 
with rwo straight kills to win game 
three, 37-35. 

The crowd started to come to 
life as the tearns took to the court 
for game four. However, UCLA 
silenced doubters with a solid 30-20 
win in game four, tying the match 
up once again at 2-2. 

Game five showcased both 
team~' abilities to step up their per-
formances with the match on the 
line. Unfortunately for the Tritons, 
UCLA stepped up the level of their 
play and UCSD eventually lost 
game five , 18-16. It started with an 
8-7 UCLA lead, but tile Tritons 
managed to tie it at 10 apiece. The 
Bruins then scored three unan-
swered points and were two points 
away from victory with a 13 - I 0 
lead when the Tritons went on the 
offensive agiain and managed to tie 
it up at 13-13 . The score went back 
and forth, forcing extra play, until 
UCLA'sJonathan Acosta ended the 
game, the match and the Tritons' 
season wi th a solo block. 

In a season where the team won 
only rwo games, an effort like this 
one against UCLA was an accom-
plishment in itself. 

Brendan Bowe, Luke Honnette, 
Adam Toren, Dickens Tai, Nate 
Jones and Rusch all played their 
last games at UCSD. Bowe led 
the Tritons in kills with 20, and 
Honnette added 15 of his own. 

Honnette led the Tritons with 
17 kills on April 13 when the 
Tritons fuced the No. 12 UC Irvine 
Anteaters. The team did not fare as 
well against the Anteaters, falling in 
straight sets, 30-25, 30-27, 30-21 . 

Game one began with back-and-
forth points until UC Irvine took 
the first big lead of the night with 
a 14-10 advantage. The Tritons 
came as close as 23-22, but never 
tied it up or took the lead, and the

The Tritons gained a 13-9 lead

tied, bu t UC Irvine went on a 2-0 
run to take the lead. UCSD got 
within one, 22-21, but never recov-
ered and lost game two, 30-27. 

Down 2-0, and on the brink of 
destruction, the Tritons did not put 
up much of a fight in the deciding 
game. They kept it close at 6-5, 
but UC Irvine's 14-6 run nailed 
the coffin shut. The run gave the 
Anteaters a 20-11 lead, and they 
held on to win the game, 30-2 1, 
and the match, 3-0. 

Losing their final two marches at 
home was not ideal for the Tritons, 

but Senior ighr provided a ,l,rreat 
game and a fitting end to the w l-
legiate careers of six athletes.

Men's volleyball takes No.1 UCLA to five games in near upset 
Head coach Ron Larsen announces resignation to coach USA Olympic team 

By RAiL ENnEN 
Staff Writer 

So far this year, the UCS D men's 
volleyball team has been pummeled 
by some of the nation's best teams. 
Thi past week, however, the Tritons 
held their own against the best team 
in the country, the UCLA Bruins, 
but ultimately lost, 30-26, 23-20, 
37-3 5, 20-30, 16- 181, in their home 
closer. 

In addition to losing ix senior 
players with the season's completion, 
the Tritons wi ll lose head coach Ron 
Larsen, who innounced his resig-
nation pril 14. Larsen, who has 
coached at UCSD since 2000, is leav-
ing to take an as i tant coach posi-
tion for the USA Men's Volleyball 

Olympic Team. 
In his first year coaching the 

Tritons, Larsen led the team to the 
national championship. After that, 
the Tritons moved up to Division 
11, where they have been less suc-
cessful . However, the Division n era 
has included wins over top volleyball 
squads including Penn State, UC 
Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, USC and 
Cal Baptist. 

Larsen brought experience to the 
table as a coach. He has held the 
whistle at the University of Rutgcrs-
Newark, UC Berkeley, St. Mary's 
College, UC Davis and for the 1996 
USA Boys' Youth National Team. 

The search to replace Larsen bas 
already begun, but his shoes will be 
hard to 611. The Tritons will come 

back next year with a new coach and 
new leaders to improve on the team's 
2005 record. 

On April 15, the Bruins came to 
RfMAC Arena with a 25-4 record 
overall and an 18-4 record in league 
play. The Tritons (2-24 overall, 1-2 1 
Mountain Paci6c Sports Federation) 
hosted the game and Senior Night 
for the players, who put in a very 
Strong effort against an excellent 
opponent. 

Game one remained close until 
late, when the Tritons took advan-
tage of a couple of Bruin errors to 
take the lead, 28-26. Crucial block-
ing preserved the Tritons' lead as 
they held on to win the game, 30-
26.

Women's tennis unstoppable 
Tritons finish 2005 with perfect CCAA record 

By EVAN WANG 
Senior Staff Writer 

The 11 th-ranked CSD wom-
en's tennis team wrapped up regu-
lar season play in dominating fash-
ion, crushing Cal State Baker field 
to finish the season with a 16-3 
overall record and a flawless 10-0 
in California Collegiate Athletic 
Association conference play. 

The Tritons traveled to 
Baker field, Calif., on April 16 
to take on the Roadrunners for 
the second time this season. In 
March, the Triton shut out CSU 
Bakersfield , 9-0. There was little 
difference between that match 
and the latter one, as l[CSD con-
troll ed th e momentum of play 
from the first serve to final point. 

T he Triton contingent con-
sisted entirely o f freshman and 
ophomore pl ayers, as th e team 

had already clinched its econd . 
consecutive CCAA conference 
ti tl e ea rlier in the week and the 
match had no major implications.

to rest a number o f her starters in

Men's crew flies to second at Newport 
Separated by seconds, Tritons beat USC and fall to Davis 

By MICHAEL NEUSTEDTER 
Staff Writer 

The CS D men's crew team 
woul d have added another victory 
to it!. season record if the 1 ewport 
Invitational had bee n imilar to 
previous yea rs. On April 16, the 
Tritons fi nished second overall 
behind C Davis in ewport 
Beach, Ca lif. T he Division I 
Aggies had never before partici-
pated in the tou rnament that typi -
ca lly features Division n schools. 

"It was a shame we lost to 
them hecause th i was the first 
ti me Davis had come down for 
the to urnament, but we still 
showed that we could bea t all o f 
the tea ms that usually participate 
in the tournament," varsity oars-
ma n Michael Bravo said. 

Lie Davis fi nished four sec-
onds ahead of the Tritons during 
the va rsity eight-boat event. The 
T ritons clocked in at six minute , 
four 'econds, while the ggies 
ca me in slightly ahead at 6:0'l. 

T he niversity o f outhem 

California finished third at 6:07. 
"We rode as fast as we could," 

varsity captain Steven Oliver said. 
" Davis was just a l.ittle bit quicker 
than we were t6day. Davis has a 
very experienced crew, and they 
have many rowers who spend a lot 
more time training." 

The loss at ewport Beach was 
the fi rst race this eason where the 
team did not win an event. 

"W e were really shooting to 
beat Davis, but they are definitely 
proving that they are the team to 
beat this sea on ," Bravo said. 

T he Triton now have 
two weeks to prepare for the 
Western Lntercollegiate Rowing 

ssociation Championship in 
Sacramento, Ca lif. The race con-
cludes the season and features all 
of the teams from the section. 

"We were pleased with the 
race at Newport, but we are going 
to rea lly focus on improvil1g our 
time so we can be.at Davis at 
the championship in two weeks," 
Bravo said. 

U SD's var ity eight-boat 

must trim four seconds off its 
time from Sunday to surpass the 
Aggies' average time. Four sec-
ol1ds represents a distance only 
slightly longer than the length of 
a boat. 

"Coach Davis said after the 
race that we have a great shot at 
improvi ng our time in two weeks, 
and we are very excited and ready 
for the cha llenge," Bravo aid. 

arsity oarsman Andres 
O netto agreed that maki ng up 
four seconds in two weeks is pos-
sible. 

"We have a great chance to 
beat Davis at the WIRA finals ," 
Onetto said. "That four seconds 
can be made up with just pure 
willpower." 

The novice eight-boat also fin -
ished second during its event at 
the Newport Invitational. T he 
Tritons fi nished at 6 :05, and 
Orange Coast College clocked in 
just tenths of a second ahead, also 
posting a 6:05 run .

with con6dence. They managed to 
stay close with UCLA, and the score 
was tied at 17 late in the game. The 
Bruins took a slim 23-21 lead before 
going on a 7-2 run to close out the 
game. "With a 30-23 Bruin win in 
game two, it was all tied up with a 
critical game three ahead. 

With the momentum up for grabs 
in game three, UCSD rode the home 
crowd and the effort of its senior 
players to a 27-22 lead. The momen-
tum could not hold, however, as

Men's tennis extends win 
streak to five before loss 

By ANGELA M. UN 
Senior Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's tennis team 
picked up another win on April 
15, dominating Sonoma State 
and extending its winning streak 
to 6ve matches on the second of 
a three-day road trip in Northern 
California. After a comeback victory 
against UC Davis on April 14, the 
No. 20 Tritons showed no signs of 
weariness at the Seawolves' court in 
Rohnert Park, Calif., as they handed 
Sonoma State its tenth loss of the 
season. Returning to the coun April 
16 at Santa Clara, UCSD's luck 
ran out as the team feU 1-6 to the 
Broncos at Degheri Tennis Center 
in Santa C lara, Calif. Details from 
the match were unavailable at press 
time. 

The Tritons (13-6) wept all three 
doubles matches on April 15, with 
captain Bryan Swatt and freshman 
Blake Meister teaming up at No. 1 
doubles to defeat their opponents in 
an effortless 8-2 victory, and opho-
more eth pector and freshman 
Will Phan defeating Sonoma State's 
Kevin Buyse and Brandon Buskirk, 

-4, at No. 3 doubles. Juniors Brent 
Molden and Erik Oijala had a bit 
more difficulty closing out their 
match against Sonoma's T.]. Veii 
and John Morton at No.2 doubles, 
but won their tiebreaker i.n a close 

9-8 victory. 
The Tritons had room to change 

their usual line-up and experiment 
playing different positions heading 
into the singles matches. Coming 
off his usual No. 2 singles position, 
junior Brent Molden played at the 
head of the lineup, defeating Andrew 
Laing with relatively little trouble, 
6-4, 6-3 , at No. 1 singles. At No. 2 
singles, Swatt defeated Andy Meusse 
in a very close 6rst set, 7-5, before 
drawing himself together and play-
ing a flawless second set, 6-0, to win 
his match. 

At No.3 singles, Oijala defeated 
Veii in a quick 6-3, 6-2 match, while 
No.4 and · o. 5 singles Meister and 
Phan each came out victorious by 
the same score, 6-1, 6-2 . The only 
UCSD loss came at No. 6 singles, 
as Sonoma State's Buskirk defeated 
freshman Alex Whitmore in a close 
match. Whitmore was able to pull 
out the first set with a 6-3 victory, 
but Buskirk came back for a 6- 1 
second-set win then closed out the 
match with a 10-1 pro-set win. 

The day before, the men had 
a tougher time rallying for a win 
over a strong Division r UC Davis 
team. The rivalry between the two 
teams has run for yearsj with UCSD 
coming out victorious in recent sea-
sons despite UC Davis' Division I
