one month of actual time and the crimes committed in 
that period on campus. Operation Identification cut the

theft significantly in the fall months. 

I.D. Program and 
Calll pus Theft 

by James G. Soto 
There has been a general decline in the number of 

rime reported on campus this year . One of the reasons 
has been the success of a new Campus Police program, 
Operation Identification. 

The U.c. Police Department joined other county law 
enforcement agencies in this new program which at-
tempt to cut down on the number of stolen bicycles, 
stereos and other items which students might have. 

The program started during registration week in the 
rail quarter with members of the campus police 
department going to various parts of the campus and 
identifying student property . To this date, over 500 
students have had their property identified in this 
program . 

The program requiresthat the subject's drivers license 
(or some suitable substitute if there is no drivers license 
available) be engraved in some obvious place on the 
property. This is to discourage theft or when theft does 
occur insure quick identification. Once the student has 
had his property identified he will receive a "Valuable 
Property Record" on which all the information (serial 
number, make, etc.) will be recorded for safekeeping. 

So far the results have been excellent. Detective Gene 
Miller reported that on one case alone he cancelled five 
cases involving identified material. Detective Miller's 
work was made easier by the engraving of the driver's 
license on the recovered property. At the present time it 
only takes two or three minutes to identify the property 
due to the statewide computer system with which the 
U.c. Police Department is a part . 

In many cases stolen property is returned before it is 
even missed. Even if it is missed and reported chances 
are that it will be recovered sooner than usual with this 
new program. Detective Miller reported one case in 
which a girl reported the loss of some identified jewelry. 
On an arrest involving a grand theft of some university 
property, the stolen jewelry was found on the suspect 
one day after it was reported missing. In this case the 
suspect tried to get the property in his possession to a 
friend but t~e property was impounded where iden-
tification was shortly made of the girl's jewelry. 

At the present time, anyone interested in identifying 
their property may come down to the police station (on 
Matthews Campus) with their goods and have them 
engraved there or may borrow one of the four engraving 
tools the Police Department ~as for Operation 
Identification. In addition, Campus Police Chief Hugh 
French told the Triton Times, that any campus group, 
formal or informal, may request the Police Department 
to ~nd a representative to engrave that aroup's per-
sonal belongings. The Police Department encourages 
the campus community to respond to this pr08ram in 
any of the three above ways. They may be contacted cit 
453-2000 (xU33) for assistance and further information.

CAL-PRIG Analyzes Food Prices 
Food prices in San Diego area supermarkets have 

declined in the last three months, according to the 
latest CALPIRG retail food price survey. The survey 
covered stores from ten retail food chains in the San 
Diego metropolitan area. Volunteer surveyors com-
pared prices on nearly 100 items in each store . 

FedMart, which has consistently been the lowest 
priced store in the survey, once again retained its 
position . K-Mart Foods, which revised its retailing 
methods into a "warehouse outlet" format, moved 
down into second place; K-Mart had been one of the 
higher-priced stores in earl ier surveys . Bradsha~s 
remained as the highest priced store, 11 .2% above 
FedMart . That situation will not continue however; 
Bradshaws spokesmen say they intend to have sold all 
of their local stores by rebruary , 1974. 

Meat price declin dover 15% in San Diego between 
August and November 15, when the latest survey was 
run . Overall , the decline wa much smaller-- light ly over 
one percent. November prices were 4.7% higher than 
June's . The greatest increase were In dairy products, 
staple , and frozen foods, which rose 15.2,11 .8 and 10.4 
percent respectively . 

The only area where prices decreased between June 
and November was in produce, where prices were down 
8% . Non-foods (soap, per onal items, pet food, etc .) 
remained stationary between June and August, but rose 

1.7% through ovember. 
rhe large drop in meat prices was Significant, a -

cording to CALPIRG Director Dan Franklin "Our Augu~t 
survey wa s run during the period of tightest control~ on 
prices, yet after the limits were lifted, pr ices dropp d 
sharply ThiS would bear out the complaints of ome 
shoppers that the control s on meat were imposed onl 
after prices had reached th Ir peak," he aid 

Survey coordinators were Ellen Wilson and Alan 
Friedman, both students at UC San Diego They were 
assisted by volunteer surveyors from throughout the an 
Diego area "Without the generous donation of 
time and effort by students, senior citizen and others, 
we would not be able to carr out the e proJects," M~ 
Wltson commented 

The survey this time Includ d Thrlftlmart for the flr~t 
time This chain has three outlets In the San Diego area , 
and everal people had reque t d that th y be Included, 
according to rriedman He added that hopper~ should 
be careful to note that CALPIRG was not recommending 
which tores were ideal. Just which had the lowest 
prices " FedMart, for instance, has generall y a smaller 
se lection of sizes and brands than other tores K-Mart 
requires shoppers to mark prices on everal of its items 
and bag their own groceries," he added

Co-op Book Exchange Re-opens 
by Rick Drom 

After an eight-week 
hiatus, the Co-op Book 
Exchange has re-opened in 
its new, larger room at 
Revelle. 

The Exchange had been 
plagued with room 
problems since it opened 
this Fall in Blake Hall. It's 
old, 88- quare foot room , 
had quickly been crowded 
with books, records and 
cu tomer~ . 

This old room had been 
given to the Exchange by 
the Revelle Residence Halls 
to see if a u ed book ex-
change would work. By the 
first day the Exchange had 
more bu iness than it could 
handle . 
Over 600 new books had 
come into the Exchange in 
the first 3 days. The Ex-
change did over $500 worth 
of business in the first 2 
weeks . Since only a couple 

of reople could fit into the 
old room at one time, line 
of people had stretched 
into the Revelle Plaza . 

Due to this success, the 
Revelle Residence Halls 
gave the Exchange a 336-ft . 
room in the Revelle 
Commons almost four time 
as big as the old room . This 
room is located on the 
South end of the Revelle 
Commons building, next to 
the Revelle Informal 
Lounge . It is two doors 
away from the Food Ser-
vices office and the Revelle 
cafeteria employees en-
trance. 

Though less centrally 
located, this new room 
should provide enough 
space for books as well as 
people. There are even 
lounge chairs and a couple 
of of as in the room to 
allow customers to sit down 

and browse 
n-.e Exchange will work 

the ame way as before An 
owner brings in a book or 
record that he wants to sell 
A form is filled out and the 
owner et the price he 
want for the book The 
Exchange adds about 10% 
to the price to cover 
opera t ing expen and 
puts the book on a Ie If the 
book i so ld then the owner 
comes in before the end of 
the academic year to 
collect hi money If it i 
not old, again the owner 
must claim hi book before 
June 1 t, 1974. 

The E change will deal in 
text book, novel , paper-
backs a well as records thi 
year . 

The E change requires 
that all books and money 
for books be co llected by 
the owner before the end of 

the academic ear If book 
or money are not collected 
by June 1st then they will 
become the property of the 
Exchange 

The condition , though

Prop. 1 • • The Way The Students Voted 
Low voter turnout and overwhelming opposition to 

Governor Reagan's tax initiative were characteristic of 
student voting behavior in the November 1 special 
election according to a study by the UC Student Lobby. 

The Lobby looked at thirty student precincts con-
nected with colleges and universities (UC, State and 
Independent). The eeneral concession was that 
although student turnout was low, students played a 
significant and possibly decisive role in deciding the 
fate of Proposition 1. 

The study stated that "voter turnout at the University 
of California campuses ranged from 38 .1 % of registered 
voters at UC Irvine to 55 .5% at UC Riverside." At UCSD 
44.0% of registered students turned up at the polls. The 
study stated further that "turnout at state university and 
college campuses appears to have been considerably 
lower" than UC turnout . 

Of all students registered and non-registered. the 
Lobby estimates a turnout of 20-25%, as ompared to a 
46.8% turnout among the general population . Even so. 
the Lobby characterized UC registration drives as 
"rather successful; the ntlmber of registered voter at 
eight student precincts at UCLA, for example, Increased 
32% between September and October 26." 

The tudy attributed greater voter turnout at UC 
campuses to I/Rreat~ votpr interest, more extf'n~lve 

coverage of Propo ition 1 In the student pre s, and a 
greater pre ence of organized voter regl tratlon and get-
out-the-vote drives." 

The Lobby noted a similarity in voting pattern 
between UC and tate universities and college, ev n 
though the latter have traditionally voted " Ie 
liberaliy." The tendency among tudent voter was due 
in large part, the tudy asserted, to a belief that pa age 
of Prop. 1 would bring about tuition in rease Th 
largest percentage of pro-Prop 1 votes \- / a found In thf' 
independent universities. The following : hart give the 
exact figures for twelve campuse .

RL~(:T~() Vi()l2T§ 
One Light Bulb Does Help 
(From the Campus Staff Gazette) "Energy con-

servation cannot be accompliShed without the desire of 
each individual directed towards the goals we must 
obtain . 

"It is the University's desire to reduce the use of 
energy as far as possible without endangering the safety 
of personnel and the mission of the University. 
. "As of December, the number of light fixtures 
removed from service lower the energy demand in an 
amount to create an annual savings of 18,240 gallons of 
fuel oil at the Encinitas generating plant ." 

Additionally, the Cam us- taff Gazette warns against 
the possible transference 0 energy emand "from one 
source of fuel to another." 

And finally, the Gazette, offers these suggestions that 
each person can use to add to energy conservation at 
UCSD: "1. limit your use of elevators to riding up four 
floors or more and always use the stairs coming down . 2. 
Double up when using vehicles, and hold speed below 
SO mph . Also, look into the car pool plan . 3. Be sure 
outside doors and windows of all air-conditioned rooms 
are kept closed to minimize the demand on air treat-
ment utilities." 

Vets Ed Ends 
The period of eligibility for education benefits is 

nearly ended for post-Korean veterans, advises Gordon 
R. Elliott, Director of the Los Angeles Veterans Ad-
ministration, Regional Office. 

He explained that post-Korean veterans are men and 
women who served in the armed forces during the 
period February 1, 1955 through May 31, 1966. The 
standard eligibility period for G.1. Bill training is eight 
years after separation from military service, but post-
Korean veterans were not eligible for benefits until June 
1966 when the current Bill became effective. As a result, 
said Elliott, the eight-year period for this group of 
veterans expires May 31, 1974 for most G.1. Bill 
educational training. 

Additional educational benefits were added to the 
current bill in 1%7 and these benefits will not run out 
until 1975. They include farm cooperative training, 
apprenticeship or on-the-job training and advanced 
flight training. Flight training courses are restricted to 
veterans who plan a career in aviation .

TYPING ERRORS 

- OUT O F SIGHT! 

~undraiser Set for 
Stricken HA 

Early in the Spring Quarter 1973, one of the Muir Res . 
Hall House Advis-ers, Artimease Oliver, was stricken 
with a serious illness. 

Artimease finished her H.A. duties at 11 p.m . She said 
she had a headache. Through the night the headache 
got progressively worse. At about 8:30 a.m . the 
follOWing morning, the headache became unbearable 
and Arti agreed to go to the hospital. As she was being 
assisted to the car she lapsed into a coma . 

Throughout the day and into the night the testing 
went on . At 11 :30 p.m . the doctors agreed that a blood 
vessel in the brain had erupted forming a large blood 
clot which was pressing on the brain . It had already 
caused severe brain damage and immediate brain 
surgery was necessary if they were to save her life. Alt 
12:15 a.m. they began the surgery. 

At 3:30 a.m . the surgery was completed; the opinion 
was that unless a miracle happened, Arti would 
probably not be able to walk or talk . At best, she would 
have a speech impediment. A few days later a miracle 
happened, and Arti did talk and now she is walking and 
improved to where she may return to school in the 
Spring. 

As you can imagine, the hospital bills, therapy bills, 
etc ., are tremendous. 

The Muir Res Halls students have decided to have a 
benefit to raise funds ; there will be a benefit showing of 
101 DALMA TlONS, courtesy of Walt Disney Produc-
tions, thanks to a great guy at Disney's named Bob King, 
and THE PRODUCERS. 

THE SHOWING WILL BE : 
WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 9th 
AT 7:30 p.m. 
IN THE GYM 
DONATIONS Will BE ONE DOLLAR 

And we sincerely hope many students will be there to 
enjoy the films and make their contributions to a very 
worthy cause.

HAPPY NEW YEAR 
Welcome 1974. Welcome a cold winter. Welcome 

rising unemployment . Welcome rising costs from toilet 
paper to gasoline. Welcome President Ford? . 

Yes-1974 does seem bleak at first glance, but It I ~' early 
and at least the potential exists to make this year better 
than the last one. It's there for the oil companies and 
the Fourth Estate . 

The energy situation grows increasingly worse, 
perhaps because the measures taken to ~ neviate the 
situation only seems to reassert the validity of the 
maxim " too little, too late ." And so, once again it looks 
as though the rich will get ri cher while the poor will get 
poorer. .. 

Recent decisions made to conserve energy by cutting 
to a certain percentage of previous use and rationing is 
costing jobs . California's unemployment may reach 
132,000 by June. Compound this with high . unem-
ployment in other industrialized states and we will be In 
the midst of a depression . 

Americans will have to give much thought to change 
in lifestyle and pace of living . They must live without 
luxuries and only necessities . Most of all they must keep 
pressure on the government for change that is equ itable 
and immediate. 

Indeed measures need to be taken to alleviate the 
situation .' But hasty and irrational decisions will only 
serve to prolong the crisi s rather than solve it. Careful 
thought must be given to any actions taken along With 
their consequences . 

Indeed 1974 will be a year of change. The changes 
that occ~r will not be the type we can fight. What is 
more, we should encourage change and see that it takes 
an equitable and modern stance. We may be able to 
make 1974 a year for landmark decisions and 
movements that will do more than any other to prepare 
us for an incredible future .

An Open Letter to 'Third College Students 
By 

Marsha Shelton 
D. J. Scales 

Dear Triton Times and Third 
College Students, 

We are presently students 
attending the University of 
Ca liforn ia at Berkeley, 
however we were Th ird 
College students last year 
and would like to inform 
present Third College 
students of their plight. 

Miss Marsha Shelton is a 
psychology major and I am 
a pre-med student also 
majoring in psychology, 
both indicating our majors 
are science-oriented . In our 
encounterment with 
faculty , administration and 
non-believing students. last 
year we informed students 
of the impotence of Th ird 
as an academic institution, 
particularly in preparing 
science majors for graduate 
sc hool. However students 
lost interest and all ac-
cusations and information 
about that disturbing 
situation is lost to the 
annals of time. We would 
like to legitimize our point 
and illustrate to our 
com radf's presently at-
tending Third (through this 
open leller) the frailty of 
continuing at that "i n-
sti tu tion":

Being a sophomore he 
asked what I took as a

the Composition class to 
satisfy the Subject A 
requirement , Third World 
Studies Classes. Com -
munications lA and lB. and 
Math 4A and 4B. He looked 
somewhat perplexed and 
went to his file cabinet to 
get a UCSD catalog. After 
checking it, he agreed that 
Composition at Third did 
satisfy Subject A, but (wi th 
that ever doubting ex-

to satisfy TWO more 
quarters of some form of 
read ing and composition in 
order to satisfy Breath 
requirements for UCSF 
(University of Ca l at San

Miss Shelton must do 
something similar for

for th e rematch of the Los Ange les Philharmoni c 
with th e works of the Baroque period's most 
infamous composer, P.D Q Bac h, as brought to 
public recognition and ridi cule by Profes or Peter 
Schicke le , 

Schickele, in his usual fine form , showed up late 
and disheveled, this time via rope from the first 
balcony level, and prefacE'd the vening with a 
history of I S. Bach 's ia t and I a5t on, PDQ

these 10 st works have been restored to the public

IS . 531(2), an oratorio The Seasonings [So Y, tsp.), 
Pervertimento for Bagpipes, Bicycle and Balloons, 
[So 66), and a madrigal My Bonnie Lass She 
SmeHeth, among others. 

Desp ite the glorious repute and exotic i n-
stru me nlation of past P.D.Q . Bach works (the 
Snfonia Concertante offers solos on lute balaika 
bagpipe, ocarina , left-handed sewer fI~te , and 
Double-reed Slide Music Stand) , Tuesday's 
concert offered a tamer breed of composition . 

Opening the program with the suite from one of 
th e th ree thus far discovered P .D.Q, Bach operas 
The Civilian Barber (the other two being The 
Stoned Guest, a half-act opera, and Hansel a"d 
Gretel and Ted and Alice, an opera in one un-
natu ra I act), Schickele conducted the l.A. 
philharmonic through the unnatural paces of 
baroque music laden with boogie-woogie rhyth-
ms, strain s of "Will iam Tell", and a trombonus 
in tefU ptu s. 

Next on the program was one of Schickele's own

UCSD Theatre, 203 MC on 
Wednesday and Thursday , 
January 9th and 10th at 
7:30. 

Blood W edding is a 
Spanish fo lk-tragedy which 
was written shortly prior to 
the Spanish 'Civll War It 
st mmed from Lor ca 's 
trong concern of the 
upressive nature of 

Spani h ociety as well a 
from hiS po tic Impulse, 

The play Will be under 
the direct ion of Dr. Michael 
Addison, the most recent 
addition to the facu lty of 
the UCSD department of 
drama, coming to UCSD by 
way of the chairmanship of 
the drama department at 
UCSB, and the aliforni a 
In stitute of the Arts, where 
he served as the Dean of the 
School of Th atre ana 
DancE' 

Addiso'l ca ll the piece 
" pas ionate, violent , and 
brutal in ItS confrontation, 
with explOS ive power and 
necessi ty for sexuality," It is 
a " tragedy of blood " 
resu iting from the conflict 
between" rigid society and 
th e explosive pas ions 
which it attempts to 
su press , It begins as a 
s eemi n g l y rea list ic 
exa min ation of rural 
spanish life, and the action 
of the drama quickly moves 
10 a su rrealist ic level of 
rea lity. 

The play will open

Basketball T earn -

. Tritons Upset Westmont 
The UCSD Basketball points . He was tollvwed by 

team upset a strong Trainer with 15, Coit with 
Westmont squad 71-68 last 
Friday in the Triton home 
gym . 

Westmont, the District 3 
NAIA Champions for the 
past two years, was sur-
prised by the hustling, 
scrapping UCSD five, which 
overcame an 11 point 
deficit in the second half to 
post their sixth win of the 
season . From the way they 
played Friday, it looks like a 
good season for the Tritons 

Led by Tall Paul Trainer 
and Joe Coit, who plays far 
above his listed 0'4", each 
grabbed 14 rebounds in the 
game and the team stormed 
from behind on a balanced 
scoring attack . 

Greg Calhoun , able to 
play now that he ' is finally 
eligible, ripped the nets 
from outside to lead the 
Triton scorin~ with 21 

13/ Mark Reed with 12 and 
Steve Higgins and Steve 
Kircher each had five points 
to round out the scoring 

Saturday night the 
Tritons kept their streak 
going and upped their 
season record to seven wins 
agai nst two losses by 
beating Los Angeles Baptist 
College, 80-74. The visiting 
Mustangs kept it pretty 
close in the first half, as the 
Tritons only had a 36-33 
lead at halftime. However, 
about four minutes into the 
second half George 
Ca lhoun and Steve Kircher 
started putting on a show. 
First, they demonstrated 
how to steal the ball and 
tapped away about four or 
five steals from the 
Mustangs. Next, they gave a 
short lesson on the fast 
break as after their steal 

they were the first ones 
downcourl. Finall y, they 
gave a lesson in passing and 
team plav as both Calhoun 

and Kircher astounded the 
crowd ith their brilliant 
passing in the fast breaks as 
the Tritons stormed to a 20 
point advantage . At this 
point the bench came on 
and finished the game. 

This win puts UCSD in 
good position for the 
Dist rict 3 title with a 2-0 
league record, and caps off 
the fas test start for a UCSD 
team in history. Vacation 
found UCSD with a first in 
the USIU tourney and third 
in both the Bakersfield and 
USD tourneys . Todav the 
teams play Biola in L.A. in a 
league match . They will be 
home next Saturday against 
Point Lorna College with 
the )V game starting at 6 
p.m.
