Clinton Will Back 
Affirmative Action 
WASHINGTON, D.C. -
President Clinton plans to 
oppose a California ballot 
initiative that would ban 
affirmative-action programs, 
White House spokesman 
Michael McCurry told 

reporter~ 1hursday. "The 
philosophical premise that the 
president works from is that 
past discrimination is some-
thing that lingers still," 
McCurry said. "The notion 
that we are at a moment when 
we can declare a colorblind 
society to have arrived seems 
very remote." He added that 
he expects Clinton to begin 
speaking out against measures 
such a the ballot initiative and 
the recent constitutional 
amendment proposal in the 
California State Senate. 
McCurryal 0 said that senior 
White House aides have begun 
consulting California Demo-
cratic Party leaders to fashion 
a common strategy. 

SDSU Students 
Protest Racy Ads 
SAN DIEGO - Protests over 
explicit sexual advertisements 
in the San Diego State 
University newspaper, The 
Daily Aztec, have prompted 
the newspaper's Communica-
tion Authority Board to 
conduct a public-review forum 
this week. The controversy 
began when the newspaper 
published a series of ads for 
Deja Vu, an adult entertain-
ment club, and Bimbeaux 
Video, a producer of "strip 
pool" video, early this month. 
SDSU spokesman Rick Moore 
said that although the board, 
which oversees the fiscal 
management of the newspaper, 
will listen to public concerns, 
the decision on running the 
ads will be left to the newspa-
per. According to Aztec Editor 
in Chief Tim Meehen, the 
newspaper is already in the 
process of editing words in the 
ads. 

"We can't blind 
ourselves to how

The REGlNTSMHTIG By Erik Johnson Senior Staff Writer Over 200 student protesters awaited the UC Board 
of Regents Thursday afternoon at the Price Center, 
while the regents were inside debating the lO-percent 
fee increases proposed in Gov. Pete Wilson's 1995 

hat 
state budget. 

The protestors sent a 
statement to the regents 
with approximately 1,500 
T-shirts collected by stu-
dents in the systemwide 
"Take the shirts off our 
backs, but don't raise our 
fees! " campaign. 

The regents come to 
UCSD Thursday amid

Revelle College senior 
John Skrinska, who was at 
the rally, said that he doubts 
the regents will pay much

was just like every other 
year," Skrinska said . 
"Nothing ever changes."

'Computer Terrorist' Caught By FBI, UCSD Graduate Student 
SECURITY: Hacker 
infiltrated files at 
Supercomputer Center 
By Jonna Palmer 
News Editor 

A computer-security expert at the 
San Diego Supercomputer Center 
and a UCSD Electrical and Com-
puter Engineering (ECE) graduate 
student have spent the last two week 
helping the FBI nab computer hacker 
and federal fugitive Kevin Mitnick. 

According to The San Diego 
Unioll-Tribulle Mitnick was already 
a federal fugitive for violating hi 
parole when he broke into UCSD 
faculty member Tsutomu 

Shimomura's personal computer 
files at the Supercomputer Center 
on Chri tmas Day in 1994. His com-
puter contained hundreds of files 
with detailed information on com-
puter-security systems, material that 
would help any hacker who wanted 
to break into computer systems. 

Shimomura, a computer- ecu-
rity expert, turned the earch for the 
"computer terrorist" into a per onal 
crusade, according to the Union-
Tribune. 

However, the first real break in 
the FBI investigation came when 
UCSD graduate tudent Andrew 
Gross who works part-time at the 

upercomputer Center, di covered 
the wher abouts of the computer 

which infiltrated Shimomura 's ma-
chine. 

Gros was unavailable for com-
ment. According to Gro 'acquain-
tance and fellow ECE graduate stu-
dent Greg Chapelle, Gro had found 
several "hole " in the network while 
he was in the Bay Area helping to 
track down the infiltrator. 

"There wa some unusual traffic 
over there is how I understand it " 
Chapelle aid. He added that some 
of the "hole " in y tern can allow 
people to break in. ' They don't pub-
licizewhat those hole are," he aid. 

According to Chapelle, such 
"holes" make it very ea y to break 
into computer y terns. " eem like 
ab ut once a week [ omeone breaks 

in] " he said. 
He added that thi break-in em-

ployed a particularly ophi ticated 
method. Chapelle sa id that Mitnick 
had even eavesdropped on the FBI 
during its investigation of him. 

Chapelle said that "apparently 
there might be accomplices" to the 
crime. 

According to the Union-Tri-
bWle, the FBI called in Shimomura 
to help capture Mitnick after the 
Chri tma Day break-in. The inve -
tigating team then tracked every 
key troke that Mitnick made and 
traced some of the phone line he 
wa using to Ral~igh , NC.

Nearly 50 California Public In-

Pacific Beach into a cleaner, safer

their students want to do."

According to 
Samir Sairam, a co-

Sara Camm, an-
other coordinator of 
the morning-long 
event, said that the 
CALPI RG clean-
watercommittee had 
been preparing for 
the beach clean-up 
since the beginning 
of Winter Quarter. 

" I feel really good

said. " People cared

Wang and Olvera both said that 
picking up broken plastic spoons, 
which could pose a danger to small 
children, made it worth while. 

Camm said that she was pleased 
with the amount of trash that the 
group had collected by the end of 
the morning. 

"We got approximately 20 
bags," Camm said. "We' re going to

BRIEFLY ••• 

UCSD Professor Wins $500,000 Chair 
UCSD Biology Professor Michael Levine has been 

named as the first holder of the $500,000 endowed 
Chancellor's Associates Chair. 

The five Chancellor's Associates Chairs, which 
have unrestricted funding, were established to recruit 
or retain exceptional faculty members. Levine's ap-
pointment. effective immediately, will continue as 
long as he is a full-time tenured professor at UCSD. 

., am delighted that Professor Levine was selected 
to hold this Chancellor's Associates Chair,· UCSD 
Chancellor Richard Atkinson said. ·With the recog-
nized excellence of our biology department, it is a 
tribute to Professor Levine that he is the first member 
of the department named to an endowed chair.· 

Since joining the UCSD faculty in 1991, Levine has 
devoted his research to discovering how patterns are 
formed in living organisms. He is trying to identify the 
master regulatory genes that control development in 
the fruitfly. 

"Interestingly, many of the genes that control the 
fruitfly embryo are evolutionarily conserved and have 
been implicated in the embryonic development of a 
wide variety of organisms, including humans,· he 
said. 

Among other things, Levine will use some of the 
funding to start a new research project involving sea 
squirts, which were recently discovered to have so-
phisticated embryos. 

Prior to joining UCSD, Levine was a biology profes-
sor at Columbia UniverSity. His honors include a Jane 
Coffin Childs Postdoctoral Fellowship, a Searle Schol-
ars Research Fellowship and an Alfred P. Sloan Fellow· 
ship.

Stephen Birch Aquarium-
Museum Holds Grunion Run 

A late-night adventure in which participants will 
observe the elusive grunion spawning on the beaches 
of La Jolla Shores is being led by the Stephen Birch 
Aquarium-Museum at Scripps Institution of Oceanog· 
raphy on Sat., Mar. 4, from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m. 

Grunion, which are small, silver fish, lay their eggs 
on beaches during certain high tides. Female grunion 
bury themselves in the sand to lay eggs, while males 
wrap themselves protectively around the females to 
fertilize the eggs. Both then catch a wave to retum to 
sea. A lecture and film will precede the observation 
session. 

The grunion run is $8 for adults and $4 for children 
ages 7-13. Reservations are required. For information 
call 534-7523.

is his nonchalant tone frightening, but his lack 
of rationality is astounding. The harm done 
to trade and relations between the United

Though I feel infe-

at least I'm able to use 
it. While growing uP.

developed enough fa· 

miliarity with gadgetry to allow us to handle

a stubborn computer, VCR or stereo, I have a

dently pitied my student pov· 
erty status. Eagerly, I went to 
my ATM machine to deposit 
it, gleefully punching in the 
numbers to spell out that de-
lightful sum. 

"IF CORRECT, PRESS 
OK KEY," the ATM flashed. 

I hit "OK" impatiently. Of 
course that was right. Who 
did this machine think I was, 
anyway? 

"IS THAT REALLY THE 
CORRECT AMOUNT?" the 
machine flashed back in dis-
belief. 

I was insulted. This mao 
chine had probably noticed 
that this was the first deposit 
I had made in months, and 
very likely one of the largest 
ever. Of course it 's the right 
amount, I shouted at it. How 
rude! 

The people behind me in 
line looked at each other and 
raised their eyebrows. But the 
tussle ended eventually, with 
the ATM grudgingly hauling

haps in about eight mill-
utes, a bored clerk will talk 
to you and tell you that all 
such transactiolls are 
halldled out of the Ne w 
York office and you will 
have to call them. 

As if it 's not bad enough that we have to 
endure this on the phone, my bank tried to 
inflict this on me in their office. I went in to 
ask why the address change I had filled out 
four months ago had evidently failed to kick 
in. I walked up to a customer-service teller 
and told her my query. She said, "You can 
use that phone over there" and pointed to a 
red in-house phone. 

I nodded, rather surprised. but picked it 
up. Then it began. Welcome to Blah·blah .... 
Please enter your account number and then 
press the pound sign. • 

I suddenly realized I was standing in a 
bank full of employees, and was about to be 
launched through the hoop-jumping exercises 
of the phonemail system. 

I hung up and walked back to the teller. 
"Can I speak to a human being please? I didn 't 
drive over here to talk on the phone." 

I am ashamed to have picked up that 
phone in the first place, but I guess we get 
used to receiving substandard service. I sup-

My mother, born when computers were 
room-sized , has the Baby Boomer

lurked in the cabinet for years before she gar-

ATMs as long as possible. My grandfather, 
born before electricity, still refuses to use 
them. My suggestion to at least give them a 
try falls on stubborn ears. "Why should I use 
some silly machine," he says with impatient 
dismissal. " I go inside and say hello to Rosie 
and the girls at the bank. That's how banking 
should be done." Rosie and the girls? More 
like HAL.

less, they 're lucky enough to have my $33.29

6 OPINION 

EFFORTS: 
Pushing for Better 
Legislation 
Continued from.,..e 4 

Since being sworn in as 
Speaker of the House, Gingrich 
has focused the bulk of his efforts 
on the infamous "Contract With 
America." While the contract is 
famous only for its supposedly 
negative or dangerous proposals, 
it contains a great deal of propos-
als which most Americans support. 
Most notable has been Gingrich's 
efforts to relieve several Califor-
nia cities from having to comply 
with the Clean Water Act. The act 
would require these cities, includ-
ing San Diego, to run secondary 
treatment on its water. Scientists 
have consistently said that this is 
not only unnecessary, but also po-
tentially harmful to the environ-
ment. This bill is the first on 
Gingrich's list of wasteful govern-
ment spending which he plans to 
abolish. He has promised to devote

he can chew

clothes? 

But the one "Newtism" which 
truly causes one to wonder about 
the adequacy of the House 
speaker's neural connections was 
his utterances on women in the 
military. In the Jan. 19 lecture of 
his Renewing American Civiliza-
tion series, he said, " ... females 
have biological problems staying 
in a ditch for 30 days." He then 
added, "[Males] are biologically 
driven to go out and hun't giraffes." 
Unparalleled to even Dan Quayle 's 
"potato incident," his blunder 
raises the question: Just how many 
males have had a biological urge 
to hunt giraffes? Rep. Norm Dicks 
(D-WA) co~mented, " I don't 

one day per month to this kind of 
government clean-up. 

In addition, Gingrich has suc-
ceeded in gelling the line-item veto 
bill passed in the House of Repre-
sentatives. This legislation would 
grant the president more power to 
eliminate wasteful government 
spending. Specifically, the presi-
dent would have the power to veto 
part icu lar parts of a bill, rather than 
being forced to veto or accept the 
entire legislation. Gingrich accu-
rately identified the bill's impor-
tance: "President after president 
has said it was something that 
would be good for America be-
cause it would allow the president 
to cut out some of the worst in 
spending." 

Beyond this, Gingrich has con-
tinually proposed overhauling the 
nation's grossly inefficient welfare, 
Social Security and Medicare pro-
grams. The Welfare System long 
ago stoppelt being a temporary 
crutch for poor people, as it was ini-
tially intended, and changed into a 
way of life for them, sapping the 

know where he has been, but this 
is not World War I. People"do not 
spend 30 days in a ditch." For 
someone who promotes technol-
ogy and advancements, Gingrich 
dwells heavily on his Brecht-like 
interpretation of war, something of 
which he knows very little. 

Democrats commonly criticize 
Gingrich's gross lack of judg-

m~ nt; but now, even Republicans 
are. beginning to see him as a 
threat to their image. When ques-
tioned about his shady book deal, 
he quickly resorted to infantile 
and evasive measures. "I find it · 
fascinating that there 's this one-
sided standard," said Gingri& in ' 
a C-SPAN interview with Brian 
Lamb. "I would be glad to debate 
any Democrat who ... turned down 
$4.5 million, " he added. 
Gingrich's contract with the 
Harper Collins publishing house 
promised him a $4.5 million ad-

government of its funds. Gingrich 
recognizes the need to return wel-
fare to its originally intended func-
tion. Medicare and Social Security 
present a similar problem (i.e. a way 
oflife), and they take up nearly half 
of the federal government's budget. 
Gingrich is attacking over-spending 
and waste -top concerns for most 
Americans. 

Gingrich has even pushed for 
legislation which would put term 
limits on congressmen, helping to 
rid the government of life-long 
bureaucrats . He has also pro-
posed legislation which would 
prevent unfunded mandates, in 
which the federal government 
can impose requirements on 
states without providing the 
funds to carry them out. On a 
similar issue, Gingrich has pro-
posed that the federal govern-
ment shou ld also shoulder the re-
sponsibility of maintaining its 
borders, rather than dtlmping the 
financial burden on the states. 

To be sure, Gingrich has intro-
duced and recommended signifi-

vance for the publishing of one 
book and the editing of another. 
He decided to forgo the advance 
after being criticized by Demo-
crats and Republicans alike. 

Republican Sen. Bob Dole 
made light of the fact that Harper 
Collins is owned by Rupert 
Murdoch, the Australian owner of 
Fox media services. Given that 
Murdoch has a large amount of 
business before Congress this year, 
many question the ethics of the 
entire situation. But sketchy ethics 
have always had a special place in 
Gingrich's affairs. 

As early as 1989, complaints 
and in~iries had been filed against 
Gingrich's managing of funds. The 
Conservatives for Hope and Oppor-
tunity, headed by Gingrich, claimed 
to its donors that their money 
would fund conservatives running 
for the House of Representatives. 
Over $217,000 came in, but only 

cant legislation which even many 
Democrats have supported. Still, 
his pugnacious temperament de-
tracts from any noble intentions he 
may have, and his hostile and pro-
voking comments antagonize citi-
zens as well as Washington politi-
cians. 

Gingrich summed up his agenda 
during his first wetk as Speaker of 
the House wh~n he bluntly declared 
that he would compromise with nei-
ther the Democrats nor the presi-
dent. Gingrich effectively guaran-
teed the American public that he 
was not interested in promoting 
change or helping the country, but 
rather in defeating the Democratic 
opposition, which would thereafter 
be treated as the unrelenting enemy. 
Gingrich recently confirmed this 
when he angrily lectured 14 Repub-
licans who had voted against Party 
leadership on President Clinton's 
$20 billion lo"n to Mexico. John 
Myers (R-ID) effectively identified 
the problem with Gingrich's de-
mands: "People can't vote for their 
convictions." Gingrich exhibited his 

$900 of this went to candidate con-
tributions. According to David 
Beers in the Oct., 1989 issue of 
Mother Jones, the rest disappeared 
in fees and travel arrangements for 
Gingrich. 

Georgia-based Salvay Pharma-
ceutical, Inc. had donated $30,000 
to the Progress and Freedom Foun-
dation, another one of Gingrich's 
organizations. Gingrich introduced 
three'bills which asked for the sus-
pension of duties on drugs shipped 
by Salvay, soon thereafter. Though 
the World Trade Agreement, which 
was signed last year, eliminated 
pharmaceutical duties, the situa-
tion reeks of poor ethics. Salvay 
later claimed that, if passed, the 
bills would have meant over 
$700,000 in lost government rev-
enues. 

Whose side is Gingrich on, any-
way? With his "Contract With 
America," he envisions conquering 

Tuesday, February 21,1995 

disregard for congressmen voting as 
they see fit. He demonstrated that it 
was more important to help the 
party than it was to help the coun-
try. 

Gingrich's bellicosity has 
stripped the Republican Party of 
the momentum it gained during the 
last election. This is evident in a 
recent poll of Republicans nation-
wide: While 43 percent gave 
Gingrich a favorable rating, 40 
percent gave him an unfavorable 
rating - hardly an impressive sta-
tistic for the supposed party leader, 
the man who is supposed to carry 
out the Republicans ' desire for 
change. 

Gingrich would be better served 
if he stuck to legislation and help-
ing the country, and avoided chid-
ing the opposition, denouncing 
party dissenters and refusing com-
promise. Perhaps his time could be 
refocused on more and even better 
legislation, thus improving his im-
age. Only then will people begin to 
see and acknowledge his good 
ideas. 

the world. Never mind that the 
"contract" is now conquering him. 
Although its sixth provision clearly 
disallows closed meetings, 
Gingrich spent two days in closed 
meetings with House Commerce 
Committee Republicans and net-
work executives, including 
Murdoch. He also insisted that Re-
publicans should not be held ac-
countable for implementing the 
details of the "contract." 

Gingrich calls up the image of 
the stereotypical politician - al-
ways out to further his own gain, no 
matter the cost to others. The only 
thing he has done right so far was 
to decide against seeking presi-
dency. His position on any subject 
can change at a moment's notice, if 
it is to his benefit. His supposed in-
telligence is questionable, his hy-
pocrisy is overwhelming and his 
disreputable ethics have no place in 
our government.

Noting that the interest in spiritual subje.:ts has increased immensely in 
recent years, Mr. Harris will share his experience in the practice of Christian 
Science - a religion that offers a new view of these subjects - although it has 
been practiced by many generations of students of Mary Baker Eddy. 

In her book, Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, published 
in 1875, Mrs. Eddy writes: "The divine Principle of healing is proved in the

REGENTS:

Continued from page 1 
budget plan and fcc increase be post-
poned until next month, when the 
Legislature will provide a more ac-
curate estimation of the Slate's allo-
cation t9 the UC system. 

"For the past few years, the bud-
get plan proposed and approved by 
the regents early in the year has 
changed significantly as a result of 
the fina I budget actions of the legis-
lature and Ihe governor," Peltason 
said. 

However, Peltason did recom-
mend that the regents make prelimi-
nary budget plans, incl uding a stu-
dent fee increase, based 0 n the 
governor's proposed budget, until 
the fi nal figures are available, 

According to the proposed bud-
get, students can expectto pay about 
$127 more per quarter to cover a 
$38 million shortfall in state funds 
allocated to the UC system. 

"We are proposing to raise stu-
dent fees for only one reason: with-
out additional appropriations, any-
thing less than a to-percent fee in-
crease would be disastrous to qual-
ity, and a great disservice to the 
students themselves .... The current 
budget plan, including both funds 
from the state and from student fee 
increases, is in my judgment, the 
minimum amount that we need," 
Peltason said. 

According to Peitason, students 
of professional schools can expect a 
fee increase of $1,000 to $2,000 
more per year. Financial aid avail-

ability will be "increased accord-
ingly," he said. 

Peltason said that faculty can plan 
on cost-of-living adjustments and 
equity adjustments averaging three 
percent, plus merit increases. Staff 
and other academic employees can 
plan on a 1.5 percent cost-of-livi ng 
adjustment, plus merit increases. 

Following Peltason 's address, Lt. 
Gov. Gray Davis urged the regents 
to seek additional means of culling 
costs at the system level instead of 
relying on additional funding from 
the State Legislature. "What I want 
the regents to do is to be more pro-
active - just don't dump it in 
Sacramento's lap," Davis said. "We 
shou ld be aggressive." Davis pro-
posed a "pro-active relationship be-
tween universities and businesses," 
as a means of generating revenue. 

"Wecan't blind ourselves to how 
much we've asked of the students 
coming to this university," Davis 
said. "There's no doubt that we ' re 
pricing kids out of school." 

Regent Roy Brophy disagreed, 
saying, "We've done everything we 
can, we can do no more ... It's okay 
with me if they keep pointing to the 
regents, but the true facts are that 
you better send your letters to Sac-
ramento, because we have no 
money." 

As part of a systemwide UC Stu-
dents Association (UCSA) anti·fee-
hike campaign, UCSD student and 
External Affairs Campus Office Di-
rector Erik NielsenpresentedT-shirts 
to the regents withthe message, "You 
can rip the shirts off our backs, but 
please don't raise our fees." 

"Students simply cannot afford

New Student Regent Edward Gomez speaks wIth Regent David flinn during Thursday's meeting at 
the Price Center. Gomez, a Riverside graduate student, was unanImously approved by the !egents. 

UCSD student and member of 
the UCSA Board of Directors Naomi 
Falk was one of several students 
who spoke to the regents. "You, as 
regents, are caretakers of 160,000 
students," Falk said. "It is your re-
sponsibility to make sure that those 
students have the opportunity to get 
a high-quality education, but also an 
affordable education. I hear quality 
over cost all the time, and that's not 
acceptable at this point." 

In reference to UC budget nego-
tiations, Falk said, "The role the 
administration plays in negotiations 
with the governor's office, I think, 
is scandalous. We will be watching 
you very closel y. " 

Following the budget discussion, 
UC Provost Walter E. Massey de-

livered a speech on the future of 
graduate enrollment. 

Massey responded to Harvard 
Professor David Breneman's rec-
ommendation that the UC enroll 
fewer graduate students to accom-
modate projected undergraduate-
enrollment growth. Massey told the 
regents that such a move would be a 
"grave mistake," as graduate stu-
dents are California's most effec-
tive means of "technology transfer" 
from the university to the private 
sector and playa crucial role in the 
California economy. 

UC graduate student enrollment 
has fallen short of numbers pro· 
posed in a 1988 UC plan, due to 
undergraduate enrollment increases 
and a lack offunding. 

The regents' only voting item for 
the day was the unanimous approval 
of Gomez, a graduate student in the 
American history master's program 
at UC Riverside, as student regent. 
Gomez will serve as a non-voting 
regent-designate until July 1, 1995, 
when the appointment becomes ef-
fective. 

Gomez has been active at UCR 
as a teaching assistantand as execu-
tive vice president for the UCR 
Graduate Student Association. In 
his application, Gomez wrote that 
he is concerned about the imbalance 
among the three missions of the UC 
system. "Although research seems 
to be faring well, public service is 
almost invisible and education seems 
to be slipping," Gomez wrote.

DIVERS: Take 
Pacific by storm 
Continued from pale 20 
hopes to get healthy before heading 
into his final tournament. 

On Friday afternoon, it was the 
women's turn again, and the Triton 
cOlltinued to make an impression on 
their upper:division opponents, this 
time in the three-meter springboard. 
Takeuchi led the San Diego trio into 
the watery duel and the three 
emerged with a sweep of places four 
through six. Takeuchi stormed to a 
fourth-place finish with a total of 
404.80 followed closely by Elfman 
(401 .50) and Young (390_75). 

"When we're competing against 
Division I schools, we're always in 
the under-dog position," Fitchett 
sa id. "But it 's great for us to just go 
in there and see how many teams 
we can knock off." 

The final day of diving was Sat-
urda y and the men took to the pool 
once again_ Burgasser was solid as 
always, coming away from the day's 
work with third-place honors and a 
468.80 tally. 

Curtiss placed a very respectable 
10th in the tough environment with 
a 339.45 score. 

"This meet was good practice for 
NCAAs because of all the rounds," 
Fitchett said. "We've got two weeks 
to shake out the bugs and give it a 
go. This is a pretty confident bunch, 
though, which is good." 

(See Thursday 's issue for Pacific 
Coast Champiollship stats 011 the 
men 's alld womell's swimming 
team.) 

TRACK: 
Crushes Claremont 
Co,-.tlnued from pBge 15 
took second in the 4oo-meter cvent. 

"We really have good depth on 
both our men 's and women 's 
teams," Salerno said. " In the past, 
one squad was always stronger than 
the other, but not this year_" 

Tritons Tom Doerr (16.29) and 
Kirk Miller (16.45) jaunted into the 
second· and third-place slots in the 
llO-meter hurdles, while Joe Cavan 
(57.89) and Miller (58_50) took the 
same awards in the 400-meter 
hurdles. 

Possibly the most impressive 
performance of the day belonged to 
UCSD's Alan Grant, who raced 
through the BOO-meter event in a 
lightning-quick, first-place 1:58_94 
time. 

In the field events, Fabian Andre 
(second place) leaped admirably in 
the high jump, while fellow Triton 
Eryn Houston hit the jackpot in the 
longjump in 21' 3.5" - earning the 
gold medal. 

Second only to the steeplechase 
as a sign of UCSD prowess was the 
hammer throw event. Randy 
Buehler and Geoff Lambert placed 
one and two overall with 47.3·meter 
and 46.7-meter marks, respectively. 

"This is really one of the beller 
overall teams that UCSD has ever 
had," Salerno said_ "We'll see how 
everything plays out in due course."

The Regents Cometh 
The UC Board of Regents convened their 

February meeting on Thursday at UCSD. 
The regents were met both as they entered 
the Price Center and as they left for lunch 
with students protesting fee increases. UC 
President Jack Peltason reccomended that 
the regents postpone voting on fee increases 
until the state legislature decides on a final 
state budget. During their lunch hour, the 
regents were presented with about 1,500 T-

- shirts gathered from all of the UC campuses 
in a "Shirts off our backs" campaign.

With Greek Week rapidly

(( r.:ii. ~,' Vantress, the Board of ~V Jjth. \I I{ ~ U.JI Directorschairperson for the 
J 

Ilik 

"=" event, is gearing up for the 
festivities. The senior psychology 
major promises that this year's 
Greek Week will be the best yet. To 
insure that, he and Tasha Oldham, 

MI hisfemalecounterpartontheboard 
put in long hours. UI think it's 
going to be a success. We have 
more than able people working 
together'H he states with the 
politeness which characterizes him. 

Van tress' goal this year is 
to go a step beyond the usual 
activities associated with Greek 
Week to promote what he coins 
"the mingling" of members of the 
Greek system with the UCSD 
community at large. The faculty 
brunch on Tuesday, February 28 is 
just one example of the outreach 
Vantress hopes to promote. "The 
idea is to show that 
we're ... concerned," he explains. 
Each student present at the brunch 
will come with a question he or she 
wishes to ask a professor. The goal 
is to pinpoint how Ihe Greeksystem 
can be improved by asking for 
suggestions. "In a sense, I'm not 
that far from non Greeks who see 
faults in the system," concedes 

Vantress. His desire is to redress 
those faults and create something 
strong and unified. His aim is also 
to highlight the Greek system's 
many positive aspects. To him, the 
strength of the Greek community 
lies in the very quality of the people 
which make it up. 

Speaking with Vantress 
one quickly senses a positive 
attitude at work. Behind a 
somewhattimid facade lies a young 
man who's ambitions have lead him 
to a number ofleadership positions. 
While only in his second year here 
at UCSD (he transferred from 
ModestoJuniorCollegeinNorthem 
California), Vantress has held a 
number of offices in the Pi Kappa 
Phi fraternity. He has been 
Philanthropy Chair, Public 
Relations Chair, Greek Week Chair, 
Pledge Class President and is 
currently Chapter President. HI 
didn't have a chip on my shoulder 
when I got here, but I realized that 
my time was limited ... [and) I 
wanted to get a lot done," he 
explainS. 

One of Van tress' interests 
outside his leadership poSitions is 
playing the piano, an instrument 
he taught himself to master. Being 
unable to read music, he composes 
new age and jazz pieces by memory 

alone . In keeping with his 
ambitious spirll, Vantress set 
himself a time limit of three years 
to establish contact with a 
recording studio. A tentative 
demo ta pe is already in the works. 

With so much going on 
Van tress still intends to graduate 
in the spring. His long term goals 
are to work in the field of 
management consulting for two 
to three years before earning 
either an MBA or a PHD in 
organizational psychology.

Organized in coordination with the 
Campus Volunteer Connection, the 
event will require students to 
volunteer from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. in 
a number of different activities 
ranging from service in a soup 
kitchen to putting on a party for 
patients in a convalescent home. 
Volunteers are required to be in the

how much these tycoons are really 
suffering, huh? 

C'mon, owners! Lei the pam-
pered babies have their way! Bring 
back Ihe old days! Yeah, we know 
Ihe Padres were no bag of Frilos, 
even wilh real players, but at least 
we could cheer our favorites. 

It wasn't whether or not they 
won or 10 t - who am I kidding? 
Losses were a given! It was about 
Gwynn going three-for-five; Benes 
striking out 12; Roberts swiping 
second! Nobody wants to spend 
seven bucks to watch some neo-
phyte like Raul Casanova go oh-for-
four with three errors.

In the other singles matches, sec-

stomped Coif 6-1,6-1; number-five 
Takemoto beat KirkpatriCk 6-1, 6-

powered Cella 6-1, 6-4. 

Saturday proved to be the Tri-
tons' toughest test, with several of 
the matches against CSULA going 
down to the wire. 

It also marked Malephansakul 's 
return to action, and it was as if she 
never left when she gave April 
Saulter the hook 7-6, 6-0 at the top 
singles position. 

"The L.A. match was really 
tough , especially the three-set 
matches," laPlante said. "We were 
behind in almost all of those 
matches in the third sel." 

Indeed , number-three Drage 
found herself down 5-2 in the third 
set to Eileen Devera, before com-
ing on strong to win the match 6-2, 
4-6,7-6. 

Number-five Gessford outlasted 
Kris Galvan in a three-set war, 6-4, 
3-6, 6-4. She, too, came from be-
hind in the third. 

Somers was back to her winning 
form at the second slot, posting a 6-

In other singles action, 
Kurokawa made short work of 
Mandy Gamble 6-1, 6-1 at the 
fourth spot, and number-six 
Takemoto pummeled Rachel Bonas 
6-1,6-0. 

CSULA's only wins were in 
doubles, where it managed to take 
two of three matches from the cruis-

Tritons Poach Coyotes 
FIRST WIN: UCSD 
softball split a double-
header with CSUSB 
By Sean Rahlml 
Slaff Writer 

The COyotes of California State 
University at San Bernardino came 
to town on Saturday, and the UCSD 

softball team 
was primed for 
its first victory 
of the season. 

And the 
Tritons came 
through, split-
ting the 
doubleheader 
with the Coy-
otes and im-
proving their 
record to 1-3. 

"I was very happy with the way 
we played," UCSD Head Coach 
Patricia Gerckens said. "We now 
have a win, and we ' ll take that as 
the start of the season." 

In game one, the teams managed 
only one run apiece and were dead-
locked Ihrough seven innings. Tri-
ton Lindsay Harris pitched a mas-
terful game, giving up only one run. 

The Tritons had an excellent 
chance to make their mark on the 
scoreboard in the bottom of the sev-
enth inning when Lisa Gil tripled 
with no outs . But her teammates 
were unable to bring her in to score 
the winning run. 

Neither team was able to score 

Lisa Gil (left) halted CSUSB on offense and defense In game two. 
in the first two extra innings, but the 
Coyotes exploded in the 10th inning 
with four runs, two coming on a 
triple by Kim Basham (3-4). 

In the second game, the Tritons 
shut out the Coyotes, 2-0. Lisa Gil 
was clearly the star, facing 26 bat-
lers in seven innings and giving up 
only two singles - all this while 

striking out three. 
Gil was also a key contributer on 

offense. In Ihe sixth inning, Gil 
singled to move Chandelle Hopkins, 
from first to third base. The Tritons 
then executed a perfect double steal, 
and Hopkins raced home. Kristin 
Schueler (2-3) completed the scor-
ing when she singled in Gil. 

The Master's Disaster, 79-66 
BUBBLE: Tritons await NCAA decision after splitting weekend's games 
By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD women's basketball 
team (16-6) is sitting ever so gin-
gerly on the proverbial playoff 

bubblc . Ranked 
eighth in the 
Western Region, 
and with the top-
eight squads to be 
given NCAA in-
vitations, the Tri-
tons could iII-af-
ford to give the 
ranking commit-
tee any reason to 
snub them. 

On Friday night , however, 
UCSD flinched. The Tritons squan-
dered a seven-point halftime lead in 
a 73-68 loss to Whittier College, 
which left their playoff hopes in 
doubt. 

UCSD rebounded on Saturday 
night with a much-needed triumph 
over The Master's College, 79-66. 
However, the biggest fight of the 
Tritons' season will take place be-
hind closed doors when the NCAA 
committee meets to determine their 
playoff fate . 

Friday night's contest featured a 
traditional UCSD nemesis: itself. 
The Tritons shot a miserly eight per-
cent from the three-point arc (1-12) 
and a disappointing 25 percent from 
the charity stripe. 

UCSD actually had the lead at 
halftime, 35-28, de pite its poor 
shooting numbers; but in the second 
half, Whittier shot 55 percent from 
the floor, including four of seven 
from three-point land, to surge into 
the lead. 

The two teams' offenses were a 

study in contrast, with the balanced 
Tritons struggling to find the range, 
while the Poets had a mere five 
players tally a point in the game. 
Karli Jungwirth led UCSD's offense 
with 18 points in addition to her 10 
rebounds. 

Sophomore Sarah Schneider also 
contributed a strong performance, 
logging 14 points and five rebounds 
in the win. 

On Saturday night, The Master's 
College became the focus of the 
Tritons' frustrations . Although 
UCSD was only able to improve its 
shooting slightly (10 percent from 
three-point land and 46 percent 
overall), the Tritons were the ben-
eficiaries of an incredible game 
from senior Michelle Henricks 
which lifted them to victory. 

Henricks was on fire hitting on 
11 of 20 shots and collecting a sea-
son-high 26 points . Her effort 
equaled that of The Master's Julie 
Christensen, who also poured in 26 
points in the game, but the rest of 
the UCSD squad ensured that 
Henricks effort would not go to 
waste. 

Senior forward Stacy Patsko hit 
for 14 points on the inside while 
pulling down seven rebounds. 
Jungwirth pitched in with nine 
points from her forward position, 
and Amy Franzen, Marica Jeffries 
and Schneider tallied six points 
apiece. 

The Tritons's final regular sea-
son contest will be at RIMAC on 
Thursday, Feb. 23. Although the 
Crusaders arc an NAIA squad, the 
game may be crucial to UCSD's 
playoff hopes considering it defeat 
to Whittier.

second to Division I San Diego 
State. 

UCSD's Renee Sprowl was one 
of the first-place winnners, grabbing 
top honors with a 5 'I" height in the 
high jump. Teammate Lisa Shepard 
did the same in the tOO·meter 
hurdles with a stunning t 5:58 time. 

The other gold medalist wu vet-
eran Tara Monaghan, who garnered 
first in the hammer throw with a 
43.7-meler throw, beating her near-
est opponent by over 10 meters. 

"[Monaghan] had a great early-
season marie, and rShepardl had a 

Ya Gatta L~ve It! 

great early-season time," Salerno 
said. 

Additional standouts on the Tri-
ton women's side were Michele 
Dominco (third) in the long jump; 
Andee Rademacher (second) in the 
javelin; Kyndra Smith (third) in the 
1500 melers; Marikka Elia (third) 
in the 800 meters; and Michaela 
Monahan (second) in the 400-meter 
hurdles. 

"[Claremont] is a good team," 
Salerno said. "But they're not as 
strong as last year's team that was 
sixth in the nation .. , [SDSU] is a 
full·fled ed Division I pro~ram that 

gets more scholarships every day. " 
The UCSD men's squad, sans 

stars such as J.J. Castner and 
Damian Coleman, managed to stay 
close, but eventually fell to 
Claremont, 86-77, 

With its opening-event steeple-

Triton track squad quickly got to '

Tritons Give and Go in Series 
'WEEKEND SPUT: The UCSD men's hoopsters run over UC Santa Cruz, 
99-68, and then slip to Bethany College, 91-80, in a two-game road trip 
ByTeddLadd 
Associate Sports Editor 

The "Quest for a .500 Record" 
may be over, but if you're currently 
residing in rookie UCSD Head 
Coach Greg Lanthier 's shoes, that 
doesn't really matter. 

After all, his young Triton men's 
basketball team (11-13), sporting a 
team completely lacking seniors, 

performed admirably over the 
weekend, riding home with a solid 
1-1 mark in a two-game road series. 

"If you think about it, even Duke 
[University) can't win all the time 
with freshmen," Lanthier said. "We 
did okay." 

Saturday's game was a rematch 
wil'h perennial hoops doormat, UC 
Santa Cruz. The Trilons !'OSled five 

players in double 
figures en route 
to a 99-68 tram-
pling. 

" We crushed 
them," Lanlhier 
said. " [UCSC) is 
just not very 
good." 

Center Malt 
Aune paced 
UCSD with 17 
points. Forwards 
Mati Minehan 
and Mark Sebek 
also each tallied 
13 points for the 
Triton cause. 

The Tritons 
were up 42-34 at 
the half, and they 
never looked 
back - thanks 
in part to Kahlil 
Allen 's ferocious 
12 buckets and 
Aune 's com-
manding 12 re-
bounds. 

of long-range bombers throughout 
the contest, led by Jason Jones ' 4-7 
treys. 

Due to Jones ' and his team-
mates' efforts - Sebek hit 3-9, and 
Minehan shol 2-5 from downtown, 
respectively - UCSD set a team 
record for three-poinl attempts in a 
game (44). 

"We're not a very good road 
team," Lanthier said. "But we're 
still a good team, and we' re on the 
improve." 

The Trilons showed Ihis lack of 
road experience in their next con-
test on Sunday night. They tackled 
Bethany College within the com-
fortable confines of a tiny church 
gym, eventually slipping in a tight 
battle, 91-80. 

" It was a strange experience," 
Lanthier said. "[Bethany's) gym is 
like a high school gym." 

UCSD siayed close at the half, 
only trailing by eight, 51-43. The 
Tritons left the locker room on fire, 
anxious to pull closer. But they 
could only muster a brief scoring 
flurry, closing to within four, 84-80, 
late in the second half. 

"We gol close, bul we couldn't 
get over the hill and take the out-
right lead," Lanthier said. 

With the Bethany loss, UCSD 
will be unable to capture the elusive 
.500 crown, even with a win in its 
final game against Menlo at 
RIMAC this Friday.

a good year and a fun experience." 

Tritons Still Undefeated 
PERFECT: UCSD 
women top Claremont 
and CSULA to go 5-0 
By Dan Sweeney 
Staff Writer 

Usually when a tennis team loses 
its number-one player, one would 
expect the squad to be facing rough 

limes . 
That is, unless 

you are the de-
fending Division 
III National 
Champion 
UCSD women's 
team. 

Entering a 
weekend in 
which they were 
playing back-to-

back matches, the Triton racketeers 
were withoul top player Michelle 
Malephansakul, who sprained her 
ankle during practice on Wednes-
day. 

By the time the weekend was 
over, however, Head Coach Liz 
LaPlante's squad (5-0) had added 
two more matches to the win col-
umn, defeating Claremont College 
at home on Friday, 8-1, and pum-
meling Division II host Cal State 
Los Angeles on Saturday, 7-2. 

As it turned out, 
Malephansakul's injury was not se-
rious. On Friday, the remainder of 
UCSO's deep lineup was able to 
pick up the slack left by her absence, 
By Salurda y 's match, she was back 
on the court to further bolster the 
leam.

The Triton domination began in 
doubles, where UCSD simply 
owned Claremont, winning all three 
contests. 

Miki Kurokawa and Susan 
Drage enjoyed smooth sailing at the 
top doubles slot, dismissing Vicki 
Coif and Ging Ging Liu, 8-3. 

Hilary Somers and Morgan 
Gessford ICed Rosie Cella and Julie 
Kirkpatrick, 8-1, and to round out 
the sweep, Yumi Takemolo and Su-
san Huberman edged Erika Anhood 

and Alison Mizuo, 8-6. 
With Malephansakul's absence, 

laPlante moved Somers into the top 
singles slot, where she lost a tough 
match to Mizuo, 6-4,6-2. A steady, 
methodical player from the baseline, 
Mizuo forced Somers into commit-
ting a number of uncharacteristic 
errors. 

The rest of the scorecard, how-
ever, belonged to the Tritons. Per-
haps the toughest match of the day

necessary. All positions 
available. Must have own 
glove. Uniforms provided. 
Contact Padres GM, Randy 
Smith'. I-BOO-534-LOSE. 

SECOND TO ONE: The Tritons hosted the VCSD Invite and took second in the college division 

'. 

Ba eball is in a sad state, no 
doubt about it. Here it is 
Spring Training, and the 
players and owner are still 
deadlocked over their ludi-
crous issues. 

What it leaves us, the 
confused legions of baseball 
fans, i a bunch of green, 
butter-fingered Joe Schmoes 
fresh off .200 seasons in "A"-
ball trying to fill the sizable 
cleats left by true stars like 
Griffey and Maddux. The only 
thing these rookie blockheads 
have over the real players is 
their uncanny ability to flub 
routine grounders. 

You've gotta wonder, 
though, how the Padres feel 
about the current status of 
things. Is this much of a 
change for them? Last year 's 
San Diego roster read like a 
bunch of replacement players 
(other then the scattered 
exceptions: Tony Gwynn, 
Andy Benes and Bip Roberts). 

By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

When you ' re the defending na-
tional champions, it goes without 
aying that everyone in the sport is 

aiming to take 
you down. 

Such is the 
case for the 
UCSDwomen 's 
water polo 
team. The Tri-
tons enter this 
campaign with a 
bull 's eye 
painted boldly 
on their chests 

and all comers are taking deadly 
aim. The Tritons began the defense 
of their title this weekend by host-
ing the UCSD Invitational. The Tri-
tons were a little too generous as 
hosts, but they managed to escape 
the weekend with a 3-2 record and 
a second-place showing in the col-
legiate division. , 

UCSD opened the tournament \ 
against long-time rival SDSU on 
Friday. The Tritons played a solid 
game and squeaked out a narrow 8-
7 triumph over the Aztecs. 

UCSD began Saturday morning 

The Tritons couldn't manuever past SDSU In the college title game of the UCSD Invitational. 
on fire, trouncing USC by a con-
vincing 13~2 tally to earn a date with 
pool B's number-two squad, UCLA. 

The Bruins played the Tritons 
tough, forcing the UCSD offense to 
work hard at its traditionally simple 
task of putting points on the board. 
However, the Tritons' might pre-
vailed as they grabbed a 6-3 victory. 

Sunday morning marked the re-

turn of a familiar opponent to 
UCSD's tank. The Aztecs, who re-
covered from their earlier defeat at 
the hands of the Tritons by clobber-
ing USC, 17-7, and UC Santa Bar-
bara, 16-2, returned for a second 
chance at knocking off the defend-
ing champions and were consider-
ably more successful. 

SDSU dealt UCSD its first de-

feat of the tournament by a heart-
breaking 7-6 score in the champi-
onship game of the collegiate divi-
sion. The loss forced the Tritons into 
the third/fourth-place game of the 
overall tournament against the open 
division 's second-place squad, 
Golden West, where they suffered 
a second-consecutive defeat by a 9-
5 tally to finish fourth overall. 

On the other hand, you ' 
have to figure, if the schmucks 
on the '94 team were the best 
the Pad regs had to offer, then 
their minor-leaguers, now 
major-leaguers by default, 
must be amazingly crappy.

FIRST BLOOD: UCSD 
suffered its first defeats 
to VCR and CSUSB 
By Sean Rahlml 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD baseball team was 
looking to remain undefeated when 
it visited CSU San Bernardino on 

Thursday and 
UCR on Friday. 
However, UCSD 
came up short, as 
the Coyotes of 
CSUSB pre-
vailed 13-7 and 
the Highlanders 
shut out the Tri-
tons, 8-0. 

In the game 
' against CSUSB, 

Ryan Ward (2-1) was credited with 
his first loss of the season as the 
Coyotes jumped out to an early 4-0 
lead, which the Tritons could never 
overcome. The Coyotes finished 
with 16 hits and 13 runs, including 
three homeruns.

Robert Fletcher said. "We hit well 
in the second hal f against CSUSB, 
but it was too late." 

The Tritons matched CSUSB 
with 17 hits of their ow n and 
scored in each of the last five in-
nings, but the game was al ready 
out of reach. The bright spots for 
the Trirons included the ever-pro-
ductive Eric Quandt (3-4), who 
reached base five times in the 
game. Craig Burke provided the 
power with his second homer of 
the young season in the sixth in-
ning. Carl Abramson came off the 
bench to cont ribute a two-run 
double in the eighth. 

The Tritons went to UCR on 
Friday looking for their first road 
win but were denied again. They 
fell behind early and were unable 
to mount a comeback. Steve 
Height took the loss (2-1). 

"The first road trip of a season 
is always a tough one," Fletcher 
said. "UCR is a good club and we 
came out flat. Their pitchers 
pitched well, but I think our hit-
ters were not ready.»

PCSCCs: Tritons 
make name for them-
selves over weekend 
By Dan Kraft 
Sports Editor 

Although the Pacific Coast 
Swim Conference Championships 
meant nothing to the Triton divers 

, in terms of 
PI~PPI" qualifying for 

NCAAs - all of 
them have al-
ready qualified -
the meet was an 
opportu!1ity to 
compete against 
Division I ath-
letes in prepara-
tion for the big 
meets coming in 

the next few weeks. 
UCSD took full advantage of 

that chance and made quite a name 
for itself among such Division I 
powers as Pepperdine University, 
the University of San Diego and 
Cal State Northridge. 

The competition began on 

Wednesday afternoon with the 
women 's one-meter springboard. 
Kristi Young led the Triton divers 
with a phenomenal set of dives that 
earned her 346.55 points and a sec-
ond-place finish. Close on her heels 
was teammate Sheri Takeuchi who 
grabbed thi rd-place with a total 
score of 342. 

The third and final Triton diver, 
Brigitte Elfman, was extremely suc-
cessful as well, earning the 10th po-
sition out of the 22 competitors with 
a 294.05 tally. 

"The competition here is much 
tougher then what we will see at 
NCAAs," Head Diving Coach Mike 
Fitchett said. "We did really welL" 

The men hit the water on Thurs-
day afternoon, and once again 
UCSD did not disappoint. Adam 
Burgasser soared to third-place in 
the one-meter discipline with a 
score of 410.75 while teammate 
Josh Curtiss fought a back injury to 
take ninth (299.45). 

A senior, Curtiss will certainly 
appreciate the three-week hiatus 
before the onset of NCAAs as he
