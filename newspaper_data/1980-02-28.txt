Black~s Nudity 
May Get Voter 
Approval in Nov. 

BY AUCE ROCKEY 
Black's Beach may 

once again be designated 
a "swimsuit optional" 
bathing area as San 
Diego voters support a 
petition drive to get the 
option on the ballot in 
this November's elec· 
tions. 

Since September of 
1977, Black sBeach has 
not had the distinction of 
being swimsuit optional 
because the San Diego 
City Council put the 
question of swimsuit 
optional on fhe ballot and 
it was voted down by a 
54% to 46% margin. 

According to Charlie 
FAIR S,mbol BaUinger, a member of the 

Friends for Alternatives In 
Recreation (FAIR), the group lobbying to return 
Black's Beach to it's former status, fewer than 
half of all registered voters in San Diego bothered 
to vote in September of 1977. 

Since their strongest support for the freedom of 
choice concept comes from people under 45, 
much of the voting power in favor of the legalized 
code was lost because the UC students were not 
back for the fall term. 

San Diego State students were here but had 
not had time to register before the vote was 
made. 

"Although the concept was defeated, polla 
show c.. majority of San Diegans favored keeping 
the swin'suit optional code," said Ballinger. He 
also noted that projections show that 10% of the 
opposing voters voted against the optional code 
so tax money would not be used to provide 
access to the beach. 

Why do people living on La Jolla Farms Road 
support the abolition 01 Black's Beach .wimauit 
optional code ? (FAIR says the '17 initiative was 
60 percent financed by Farm. residents.) 
Ballinger believes they are annoyed by such 
distrubances a. people asking to use their

telephone. and litter .trew in their yards. 

Ballinger also noted that in the past two and a 
half year., members of hi. organization have 
made a point of watchina La Jolla Farm. Road to 
find out who i. causing the problems in the matter 
of litter and dressi~ in the street. 

"95% of what we ve obIerved hal come from 
.urfer. rather than people who .imply sun 
themselve. at the beach," said Ballinger. "La 
JoDa Farm. Road reticlents have not attempted 

, to ban surfing." 
Nude .unbathers, when noticed by police, 

usually receive a $25 citation. Of the 1200 foot 
stretch of Black., 900 feet are governed by the 
cit),.1be rest i. controlled by the .tate. 

While city police can issue citation. on the 
state portion of the beach, they have largely 
chosen not to, according to Ballinger. 

"What the police chief and deparbnent are 
saying is that they have better use. of available 
resource. than checking out nude. at Blacks 
Beach," he noted. 

The next time San Diegans go to the poll., the 
chance. of reversing the 1977 decision are "very 
good," according to FAIR. 41,000 valid petition 
signatures are needed to put the .wimsuit 
optional initiative on the ballot and the members 
of FAIR have been seeking .ignatures since 
January.

Tiersma: Search Committee 
Visit to UCSD Unlikely 
BY JEFF BERESFORD-HOWE 

AND JENIFER WARREN 
Candidates for the chancellor's 

post here will probably not visit 
campus, the two .tudent 
representatives to the search 
committee asserted last night, and 
the AS might withdraw the 
undergraduate representative to 
the committee because of it. 

Graduate student Peter Tiersma 
said he talked with UC President 
David Saxon last week, who told 
him that "though he realized that 
there was a lot of pressure on 
campus to bring the candidates 
down here, he thouRht· it was 
important to finish the process. 

"His compromise to me was to 
have one single candidate visit the 
campus after he's been selected by 
the committee. 

"That's not acceptable, because 
there's no opportunity for 
comparison between candidate. 
then. I don't think I completely 
represent graduate students, and I 
want others to see the la.t 

candidates before they're here," 
Tiersma said. 

A resolution approved 9·2·2 in 
last night's AS Council meeting 
called on the committee to 
"guarantee" campus visits by the 
finalists; if the committee does not 
do so, the resolution says, "then 
the AS representative to the 
Selection Committee (Cheryl 
Dunnett) wiD be withdrawn from 
the committee to illustrate oW' 
condemnation of the undemocratic 
nature of the chancellor selection 
process." 

Council rnemben were virtually 
unanimous in voicing their 
displeasure with the pollibility that 
there would be no visits, AS 
President Carlos Montalvo saying 
that "the whole legitimacy of the 
search process wiD fail without 
cam~. visitation." 

IIThis is obviously an 
undemocratic, bottom-of -the·line 
bad procell, and students, faculty 
and staff .hould be outraged," said 
council member Brad Barham. 

Dick Semerdjian, member of the 
student adjunct committee to the 
Regents' Committee, said a 
"media blitz" through the Lo. 
Angeles Times, the Setn Die,o 
Union and campus media wiD be 
used to generate public awareness 
of the decision. In addition, a letter 
reque.ting students, faculty and 
.taff to protest this decision wiD be 
circulated by the committee. 

Undergraduate committee 
representative Cheryl Dunnett 
believe. that Saxon acted without 
pr0r;.r consideration. 

I (Campus visits) were always 
something we talked about, but 
Saxon never gave us a definite 
commitment," she says. This 
wasn't even discussed within the 
committee. It was justdecideci, she 
concluded. 

Council members also hope to 
get the Academic Senate to pus a 
resolution urging a campus visit, 
but the Senate met T uesda)' and 
wiD not meet again until late 
March. 

Analyst Criticizes UC Bid to 
Equal Top Academic Salaries 

BY CAROLYN FRIDAY 
s.a.-.to eon.lpOIllient 

In hi. annual review of the 
budget, legislative analyst WiUiam 
Hamm came down hard on a 
proposed 10.8 percent faculty 
salary increase in UC's budget, 
attacking Pre.ident David Saxon's 
hope of "creating eight Harvard. 
of the we.t." 

In an effort to upgrade the 
quality of faculty by offering higher 
salarie., Saxon and the Board of 
Regents had proposed last 
November" to whittle down the Ii.t 
of eight in.titution. traditionally 
used for faculty salary 
comparison. since 1972 to the 
"nation's mo.t distinguished 
univer.itie." .. Harvard, Stanford, 
Yale and Michigan. 

"Our analy.is suggests it is 
neither academically ju.tified nor 
fiscally .ound policy to endorse 
UC's concept that the University of 
California can and .houId be a 
leader with regard to compen.a· 
tion," Hamm stated in hi. budget 
reView for the legislature. 

Hamm pointed to the lack of 
objecti¥e eVIdence that would 

justify putting all eiiht campuses 
on academic parity with the four 
schools. 

"Everyone concedes Berkeley 
and UCLA are on the level 01 Yale 
and Ann Arbor, but they are aI.o 
heads above the other six UC 
campu.es," explained a legislative 
con.ultant from Hamm's office. 

The analy.t's review also noted 
that other legislative program. 
would .uffer because "from a cost 
standpoint, it would require a high 
priority fiscal committee for 
California to upgrade the total 
UC system to this level." 

Even if California had sufficient 
resources to put the eight 
campuses on par with the four elite 
institution., the analysts pointed 
out there would still be a basic 
policy illue of whether California 
should seek to have nine (Stanford 
and the eight UC campuse.) of the 
12 most elite and highest paid 
institutions in the country. 

"We can not determine a ,public 
policy purpose for establishing 
such a monopoly of educational 
capital in one state," contended 
Hamm. 

UC Associate Professor. and 
Assistant Professors already make 
more than their counterparts at 
Harvard and Yale. Hamrn cited 
that in supporting hi. contention 
that the traditional li.t of eight 
comparison institutions is more 
than sufficient for ensuring UC's 
competitiveness in this area. 

The other four in.titution. 
usually used by UC to compare are 
the State Univ~sity of New York, 
Illinois, Wisconsin and CorneD. 

The analy.ts concurred with the 
Commission on Postsecondary 
Education in finding that a 3.8 
percent increase in UC faculty 
salaries for 1980-81 would suffice. 

In addition, the analysts 
recommended cutting $ 7 .6 million 
from the governor's proposed UC 
budget of $965 million. 

Although the analysts 
supported creating 92 under-
graduate teaching assistant 
position., more medical residents 
and four additional medical 
students at Riverside were not 
warranted, the office said.

Dumb Kids, Don't Know Enough to Come In ... 
. BY KA1HV HUFFER 

I c:an't. ~ber his name after aI~ these yearl, but 
for simplicity • aake 11 remember him as Jimmy. 

Jimmy looked to be about six year. old, and wore 
navy blue shorts with .traps. Hi. arm. reached out in 
supplication to obtcurity, and hi. face was frozen in a 
tender, innocent and tru.tinJ( smile. 

Kathy HuHer i. manallinll editor 01 The Daily 
Guardian. 

A dose friend of mine found him in a large trash bin 
behind J.C. Penney's (presumably a discard from the 
children's department.) He was a little worn and 
grimy, perhaps, but perfect for our tastes. 

The first time we took him out together, we had 
nothing better to do than to exercise our restlessness. 
So we took Jimmy for a walk around the 
neighborhood-he standing stiffly between us with his 
unfaltering smile, and my friend and I on the lookout 
for our first victim. We spotted her soon, sitting or 
standing on her front porch. 
. As we n~ared her, my friend and ( began scolding 

Jimmy, at first only vocally, but then physically. We 
lifted him by his plastic arms and began striking him on 
the ground. We slapped his face repeatedly and 
slammed his head against the concrete, much to the 
horror of the woman. 

Several cars passed by as we continued the harsh 
treatment of Jimmy. 

But we soon tired of the game and set our minds on 
devising something more exciting. As we reached the 
bottom of a long and steep hill, the Idea came. And

within a few mOments, Jimmy was .tanding, smiling 
with extended arm., alone in the center of the road. 
Meanwhile, my friend and I positioned ourselve. 
incon.picuously behind a thick clump of bushe •. We 
squatted on our heels and waited. 

It wasn't long before the fint car appeared at the 
creat of the hill. The driver mu.t have .potted Jimmy 
immediately, for he slowed il car down to a crawl. As 

. he inched his way down the hill, Jimmy remained fixed 
to the road, oblivious. When the car came within 100 
yards or 10 of Jimmy, the driver timidly honked his 

The driver must have spotted

horn. But Jimmy didn't budge. Confused, the driver 
honked again, but stubborn Jimmy didn't even 
flinch. 

The car stopped in front of Jimmy. Leaning his head 
out the window to yell at the foolish child, the driver 
suddenly beamed with discovery, backed up his car a 
few feet , and drove around and past Jimmy. My friend 
and I plugged our noses and laughed. 

The next car soon appeared from over the hill. 
When the driver saw the little boy in the road, he 
commenced insistent honking but kept up his speed. 
The honking seemed to last forever, and my friend and 
I clutched one another, hiccupping. The car braked 
heavily when the driver realized Jimmy wasn't going to 
relent. He paused for a moment gazing at the stubborn 
child through his windshield, and then broke into a 
knowing smile. Looking amused, he drove around and 
beyond Jimmy. 

Several more cars confronted the intractable 
Jimmy, and each driver, I remember, reacted 
differently. One man and woman, when they 
understood the scenario, backed their car up, .hifted 
back into drive and drove straight into Jimmy, gently ' 
knocking the ever .• miling boy who hollowly banged to 
the ground. Another driver, after my friend and I 
helped Jimmy back to hi. feet and crept back behind 
our lair, looked IOmewhat di.gusted when he 
recognized Jimmy for who he was . 

rUlally, a man pulled his ear to the oppolite side of 
the road. My friend and I froze in fear. Within 
moments, the man spotted ~, and angrily summoned 
UI from behind the shrubs. 

• ;iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii __ ;;;;;;;;;;;; __ iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii~ He IecbJred us atenily for causinll a traffic hazard 
• and bei"ll "bad" girl., Several neighbon gathered 

around, lOme clucking in reproach and others coming 
to our defense. One of the latter began arguing with the 
motorist. Backing up to emphasize his point, he 
suddenly plunged into his swimming pool. 

My friend and ( decided we should grab Jimmy and 
gracefuly depart, so we began climbing up the road. 
When we reached the top of the hill, my frien~ and I 
exchanged knowing glances. And in a few moments, 
Jimmy was once again alone in the road, my friend 
and I safely tucked in the roadside woods. 

Before Jimmy stretched a long, gently curving road. 
He appeared almost transcendent with his lonely 
outstretched arms and smile. My friend and I were 
inexplicably quiet. After what seemed like an eternity, 
we saw an approaching car in the distance. It came 
toward us quickly, and we silently and fixedly watched 
it speed down the road. I remember the· thought 
crossed my mind that Jimmy looked remarkably real, 
and coutd not be identified as anything else until he was 
within walking distance. ' 

Time seemed to melt into slow motion as the car 
neared, and only Jimmy among the three of us was 
unconcerned. The car was getting close, and still the 
driver maintained his reckless speed. When is he going 
to stop? I wondered silently, breathing harder . But as 
my friend and I stared blankly, we watched the car 
bear down on Jimmy. 

Suddenly the driver must have seen the lone child in 
front of him, for his brakes shreiked shrilly, echoing 
into the vast woods. Just after we heard the loud 
stacatto hit, we glimpsed the car swerving toward the 
trees . But my friend and I were already tearing through 
the woods heading nowhere, just away. Tripping over 
branches and shaking with fear , we kept running until 
we were safely back at my house. Breathless and 
shaken, we dragged outselves to my room, where we 
waited for the worst. 

But we heard no sirens. The police didn't come to 
take us away, and my mother didn't come back to my 
room to demand answers. Nothing happened.

Test May Predict 
Crib Death Victims 
BOSTON - New tests may tell parents whether they are likely 
to have children who are susceptible to sudden infant death 
syndrome, the mysterious disorder that is the nation's biggest 
killer of infants. 

The tests show that parents of susceptible babies often do not 
inhale powerfully if their breath is cut off. And even though this is 
not a serious problem for grownups, researchers theorize that it 
may .be a fatal defect if passed on to children. 

The new study, conducted at Rutgers Medical School, was 
published in Thursday's issue of the New England Journal of 
Medicine. 

Sudden infant death syndrome, sometimes known as crib 
death, is especially shocking for parents because it takes the lives 
of seemingly healthy babies without warning in their sleep. Its 
exact cause is not known, although some doctors believe that it 
represents several possible defects rather than a single disease. 

Sudden infant death syndrome is the leading cause of death of 
children between one week and one year in age. In the United 
States each year, it takes more than 10,000 babies, most often 
in the third and fourth months of bEe. 

Doctors tested the breathing of six pairs of parents of babies 
who had died of the syndrome and compared them with six 
normal couples. They measured whether the adults breathed 
harder when levels of carbon dioxide in their blood increased or 
when their breathing was obstructed. ' 
In both tests, the breathing response of the parents whose 
children had died was "significantly lower:' 

They concluded, "a low ventilatory response to carbon 
dioxide and a diminished compensatory response to increased 
airway resistance may increase a potential parent's risk of 
having a child susceptible to SIDS." . 

Dr. Philip L. Schiffman, one of the researchers, said it would 
be impractical to give the breathing tests to all adults who want to . 
have children, but they could be administered to those who 
believe the disorder runs in their famiHes.

predicting. . 

In a 12·month outlook of 
the nation's energy situatlon, 
department economi.ts took a 
more optimistic po.ition on 
gasoline prices than many 
private analy.ts, who are 
forecasting even steeper 
increases during the current 
year. Because of the higher

IFYOU FAN 
If you missed 1957 you missed the Russians launching Sput-
nik I into earth orbit. You missed seeing a young singer 
continue his rise to the top of the record industry with a song 
called Jailhouse Rock. You missed the ballyhooed introduc· 

tion of a car called Edsel. And you missed the birth of an 
industry when a group of talented young engineers and -

scientists formed the nucleus of Fairchild's 
semiconductor operations. 

Though you missed the beginning, 
you haven't missed the future. Tal-
ent, enthusiasm and hard work 

can take you as far today as it did 
in 1957. Maybe even farther. Today, 

with the vast resources of our parent company, 
Schlumberger Limited, Fairchild is committed to 
technologicallead~rship and innovation. And while 
we're pioneering new technologies, we are also creating 

new career enrichment and em-
pl.oyee benefit programs. 

Fairchild has exciting career openings on 
both the West and East Coasts. 
We'll be on campus in the next 
week or so and would like to talk 
to you about the future. Yours 

and ours. Visit your placement center for the time and

OTEC. "The operation of the 
OTEC plant will probably 
modify the thermal, biological, 
physical and chemical 
properties of its environment," 
Springer said. 

The possibilities of 
synthesizing fuels from 
photosynthetically produced 
plants, or biomass, were 
presented by Dr. Wheeler 
North of Kerckhoff Marine 
Laboratory. 

"Plants offer a promising 
fuel in the form of methane," 
North stated. "The highest 
methane producer of almost 
a ny plant that has been tested 
is the marine plant kelp." 

According to North, the 
methane is produced by 
crushing the kelp plant and 
combining it with bacteria. 
The bacteria anaerobically 
(without the comsumption of 
oxygen) digest the kelp and 
give off methane gas as a 
byproduct. 

North believes ~quid fuel 
can also be obtained from 
marine biomass . "The 
possibility of liquid fuel from 
plants has not been researched 

enough yet. We're still looking 
for answers by experimenting 
with 70 types of bacteria to 
discover which ones produce 
other forms of fuel. For 
instance, perhaps a different 
combination of bacteria could 
produce liquid fuel for internal 
combustion engines," he said. 

Dr . Bill Thomas, a 
researcher at Scripps Institute 
of Oceanography, discussed 
the investigations into 
producing energy from micro· 
algae. 

According to Thomas, the 
fat that composes 50 percent 
of algae cells can be converted 
into methane. The problem, 
however, is trying to find 
enough algae to make the 
proposal worthwhile.

"Micro.algae is too diluted 
to harvest naturally . We are 
trying to produce dense 
cultures of algae, and shift 
their metabolism to produce 
more fat by supplying less 
nitrogen than is nQrmally 
rCCLuired," Thomas said.

Analyst Knoc~s UC' Salary Plan 
Continued from fHIIC 2 

Continued from page 1 
He allo recommended 
impoa~ a $1 ,000 per year 
health/lcience tuition for 

' medicine, veterinary and 
dentiatry ltudents. 

And, the analYlta 
recommended for the second 
straight year that the UC 

request for $1.8 million to buy 
out the university's share of the 
undergraduate affirmative 
action program would amount 
to giving UC a gift of $1.8 
million for unspecified 

~ses. , 
The analY6tl also struck out 

at the university's energy 

relearch, Ipace-related 
research, farm management 
program and the Institute of 
Industrial Relations, .ug-
gelting these programs could 
be funded from alternative 
sources or make use of funds 
allocated last year but left 
unspent. 

A tittle dazed, my friend and I waited. EndJeuly. 
We got permiuion to sleep out on the porch that 

night, and we dreued warmly for the coollummer air. 
An hour or so after the lut Iighta had gone out in the 
houae, we quietly crept from our aleeping bagl, slipped 
out the porch screen door and began walking. 

I can remember how mYltical and challenging the 
night aeemed. We were solemn, and lpoke little al we 
neared the hill. The moon muat have been out, for light 
peered through the treea. and we could see quite well. 
We descended the hiD and reached the top at the other 
aide. 

Scientists Probe Sea's Energy 

Suddenly my friend pulled back a little and gasped. 
Next to ua on the aide of the road Waf the naked torlo 
of Jimmy, blackened with dirt and tire markl. We 
found an arm a little further up the road, and I think we 
even found hil lhirt at the edge of the woods. Neither of 
us said anything. 

We held onto the remains of Jimmy for a few 
momenta. and then hesitatingly set him back down on 
some leavea. We atared down at him, then at one 
another a bit uncomfortably. Reluctantly, we turned 
away. And accompanied by the hiuing of the rultling 
leavea, we slowly walked home, lhivering.

Itated. "1be deeper the water 
gets, the more the cost. 
Offlhore drilling COlts for 
1977 were $47 per foot on

water in depth. of Ie.. than 
200 feet. This figure has 
probably doubled today," he 
laid. 

One of the most astounding 
energy ideas was propounded 
by Dr. Gerald Wick, formerly 
of ScripPI Institute of 

Oceanography, and presently 
director of the Zen Center 
Inltitute of Transcultural 
Studies in Loa Angeles. 

According to Wick, a 
completely untapped source of 
energy exists where rivers Row 
into the ocean, represented by 
a large olmotic pressure 
difference between frelh and 
salt water. Becauae of this 
salinity gradient difference, a 
240 meter waterfall 
theoretically exists at the 
mouth of every river and

"If all the salinity-gradient 

power from rivers were 
converted, it would lupply 
about 10 percent of the

demands," Wick said. 

According to Wick, an even 
larger source of energy exilts 
in subterranean formation 
called salt domes located 
adjacent to or under the sea. 
Salt domes are of interest 
because they are likely sites for 
oil and natural gas deposits.
