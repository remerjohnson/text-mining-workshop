COSA Revelle 
COSA' s plan for Revelle gov-

ernment, presented Tuesday, 
calls for representation from all 
members of the academic com-
munity. They envision a council 
composed of the College Dean, 
Resident Dean, Resident Fellow 
(grad stUdent), three faculty, and 
six undergraduates - two juniors, 
two sophomores, and two fresh-
men. 

Plan Revealed 
able to petition for an open Town 
Hall Meeting oC COSA. 

Open meetings will be held 
next week on Monday, Tuesday, 
and Wednesday in the South Din-
ing Hall to discuss this plan. 
All students who wish to make a 
presentation should sign up in 
the Provost's office with Mr. 
John Nuber, Resident Fellow in 
Beagle Hall. 

Annoonced 
"College government must be • 

formed now. It is extremely im-
portant to put it into effect--in 
ten years it will be too late." 

As stated by Tom Shepard, 
newly elected president of the 
AS, this was the consensus ot 
Provost Paul Saltman, Bob Boyd, 
and Prol. Walter Kohn at a spec-
tal convocation of Revelle College 
held at noon last Monday. 

Called to present the report of 
the Revelle Committee on stu-
dent Affairs (COS A), the unpre-
cedented meeting allowed stu-
dents in USB 2722, 2622 and the 
HL Auditorium to hear the opin-
ions of four representatives, 
from the Provost's Office, the 
Associated Students, the Inter-
hall Council, and the Revelle 
Faculty. 

Provost Saltman announced that 
petitions will be available this 
week for the committee of six 
students who will write a consti-
tution for Revelle's government. 
On Mon1ay, Tuesday and Wednes-
day next week at noon, open hear-
ings will be held in the South 
Dining Hall of Revelle Commons 
to discuss various aspects ot the 
COSA plan. 

"The most important aspect of 
this plan," Salt man said, "is that 
it brings together the students, 
faculty and staff into the college 
concern, and mvolve the graduate 
students; it is essential that they 
participate. 

The COSA recomm~l1dation , 
however, is not binding upon Re-
ve lle students. "It is onlyan,.out-
line of the ideas and concepts 
which will eventually be incor-
porated into a constitution, and 

con't on page 6 
Their proposals are stited in 2 

series of recommel1dations. Un-
dergraduate membership would 
be elective (early in the Spring 
Quarter), with faculty member-
ship being determined by the 
Revelle Faculty. Graduate stu-
dents, now in the process of or-
ganizing themselves, will also 
be represented. 

Choice '68 Indicates 
Firm McCarthy Support 

COSA suggests the formation 
of several standing subcommit-
tees under them--main body, to 
be called Executive Committees. 
Some examples are: Budget, 
Elections and Governmental Re-
vision, Policy and Regulation, and 
Operational Committee Authori-
zation and Membership. 

Subordtante to these Executive 
Committees will be Operational 
Committees, oC which there will 
be as many as are needed. These 
committees will deal with more 
specific areas, such as Resi-
dence Halls, Commuter students , 
and Student Counseling. 

Two other suggestions re in-
cluded in COS 's report. Th 
first proposes that the future 
equivalent of ASUCSD be tormed 
by a d legate from the COSA 
equivalent of each college. Th 
other provides for students being 

Senator Eugene McCarthy, D-
Minn, has won clear-cut vic-
tory over 12 other entries in the 
"mock election" Choice 68, beld 
April 24 at college campuses ac-
ross the country. 

With votes counted from all but 
250 of the 1207 colleges that 
participated - a total of 1,071,637 
votes - McCarthy received 
285,988 votes, or 28%. His closest 
contenders were Sen. Robert 
Kennedy, D-NY, with 213,832 
(20%), Richard Nixon with 197,167 
(18%), Gov. Nelson Rockefeller 
of New Y IJrk with 11 5,937 (11 %), 
and President Johnson with 
57,362 (5%). 

Vice Presld nt Hubert Hum-
phrey was not on th ballot, 
having announced his candlcy too 
late. However , h recelv d the 
most write-in votes otanycandt-
date - 18,535 (2%). George Wal-
lace nd Ronal1 Reagan each re-
ceived aoout 3%, with Charles 
Percy getting 1 nd 1/2 %. 

In a referendum on what course 
of military action the United 

states should pursue in Vietnam, 
45 per cent of the s tudent voters 
favored a phased reduction while 
21 per cent urged an all-out 
effort. 

Seventeen percent voted for an 
immediate withdrawal of U.S. 
force s, 9 per cent wanted an in-
crease in the level ot military 
activity and 7 per cent opted for 
the current effort. 

As Cor the bombing of Vietnam, 
the vote was 29 per cent each for 
permanent c?ssation and tem-
poruy suspenison. 

Another referendum sked what 
should be given th highest pri-
ority in governm nt spending to

vote, education (40 per cent) 
edged out job tr ining nd em-
ployment opportuniti s (39 %).

The vote was jointly sponsored 
by Unlv c and Tim magazine, 
with the results being tabulated 
by computer.

Student Power Coming·Warns 
Ex-President Altenhoff 

"If the administration and fac-
ulty do not start listening to 
the students, what happened at 
Columbia will happen at UCSD," 
warned outgoing AS President Ri-
chard Altenhofl at the Installa-
tion of New ()!ficers banquet 
last Monday. 

The second annual affair, held 
in La Jolla, honored the outgo-
ing AS senators and officers and 
the ten new members of the AS 
Senate. All three college provosts 
--Paul SaItman, John stewart 
and Armin Rappaport--among 
other guests, were present. 

Altenhoff claimed that student 
power was possible now only 
through the seizure ol a cam-
pus building."How to avoid 
someone seizing one of the build-
ings will be a problem on this 
campus --this utopia." 

As a warning to the new sena-
tors, Altenhoff said that the po-
tential ot the system of student 
government is limited. "If you 
do not accept this, drop out of 
the Senate." 

The senior from lllinois also 
cOmmtHlted on the lack of respect 
for student opinion on formula-
tions of rules. "We saw it in the 
cap and gowns decision. Student 
opinion was voiced nr! not lis -
tened to. The Chanc llor decided 
we must abide by 'tradition.' II 

In his inaugural speech Tom 
Shepard emphasized that "the 
AS is for the students. We must 
do wh t we think is best. But 
if by our actions we decrl!ase our 
power, I will not stand for it." 

'Bill E stman tood up before 
th banquet was ended hy m "ter 
of ceremouie e ris Hollinshead

ing children of thi e rth, living 
in d prived condi ions. It will 
take s lot of convictions to change 
our course." H plored th 
expenditure oC AS f s to "stuff 
our stom cbs." 

In rebuttal to Eastman, Ralph 
HinchCliffe, philanthropist from 
La Jolla, and personally respon-
sible for planting flowers around 
the coffee Hut, asked what he had 
done to aid stUdents. He then ask-
ed Altenhoff how he could talk of

Take a Lesson From Columbia 

Reaction to the assassination of Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King wa3 probably quite surprising to many 
Americans, both the extent of the violence that erupted 
and the profound and far-reaching effects it has had 
upon our society. Most probably the recent hous ing 
b!I1 would never ha ve passed it the stalling Senators 
on Capitol Hill had not been suddenly impressed by 
the urgency of the matter. Unfortunately it seems 
in this country that some catalyst is necessary to 
s hake people out of their drifting, lethargic apathy 
before any action is taken. 

Within the last wet!k anothe r event has occurred 
that has emphaSized the urgency of a problem. This 
problem ca.rlnot be compared to the civil rights prob-
lem by any means. HO'Ne ver, the analogy can be 
extended, for it took a dramatic event to awaken us 
to it. A discussion of this problem is especially 
appropriate in this , a student newspaper, a s it has 
overwhelming s ignificance to all me mbers of the 
academic commUility.' It raises ques tions that might 
ultimately call for a complete reappraisal of the cur-
rent educational system. 

The recent student take-over at Columbia Unive rs ity 
has made us aware of the existence of a new " gap." 
The s ituation there brings to light the almost total 
lack of communication between the administration 
and the administrated . U so- called " official channels" 
did indeed e xist at that university, they were certainly 

Guest Editorial 

so clogged with bureaucracy and red tape that the 
administratio n was not aware of the extent of the 
students' grievances. 

The imm':!dJate problem at hand at Columbia wa3 
that a group of students felt that the University was 
wrong in building a new gymnasium on property 
previously designated as a playground Cor the Chil-
dren of Harlem. But what was at stake in the long run 
was the question of the role that students deserve 
(0 play in the university of which they are a part. 

Should the policy ot a university community like 
Columbia, which consists of more than 27,000 people, 
be determined by a board consisting of a handful of 
people ? Isn't a univerSity only what its faculty, stu-
dents and administration working as a whole make it? 

11 seems that the modern university traditionally 
has two roles to fulfill. The tirst is to give profes-
sional competence to a person in order to enable him 
to earn a living in society. The other role, perhaps 
the more important one, is to encourage him to 
develop as a human being, exposing him to ma.ny dif-
ferent fields and viewpOints. 

When it comes 0 th lirt role, that of giving pro-
fessional competence, the authority of the educator 
cannot otten be disputed. Who is the average student 
to tell his physics or history professor what he should 
or should not be taught? 

Howe ver, when it comes to the second aspect of 

education, the student has much to say. Perhaps he 
is not satisfied with the state of society today. Per-
haps he feels that we should be moving in different 
ciJrections. Perhaps he teels that some of what he is 
learning bears no relation to his life. Should he not 
be free to explore the paths that he feels that will 
lead him to a greater understanding of himself and 
of life? Shouldn't he have a vital say in how he develops 
as a person? Shouldn't he also have a say in decisions 
made by the university that affect him directly, or as 
a thinking being? 

The students at Columbia thought that theywereen-
titled to have some say. It is unfortunate that their 
conflict with the administration led to a situation in 
which the students turn to violence. In the end more 
tens ion was created and the chances for student-ad-
ministration cooperation without confrontation were 
dimm tl r. 

Let us hope that not only the administration of 
Columbia University but all administrations at col-
lege campus~s recognize that all members ot the 
academic community shoul d be allowed to take a 
part in shaping the destiny of that community. Let 
us hope that more administrations will recognize 
the value of RES PONSIBLE student opinion. 

The Riots Were a Blessing, But ••• 
(The following Guest Editorial was submitted to the Triton Times 
by Special Forces 4 Robert Baum. He is currently stationed at Bien 
Hca, Vietnam, and has been in that country for 14 months.) 

The riots and the blood of these past few years have forced upon 
us the r eality of a nation divided. We have seen our cities torn, 
burned, looted; tanks and Fede ral troops patrolling our property. 
The resu lt ot such sights has been good. This was the stimulus 
while Arne r ica, the passive middle ma jority , has needed. 

But now the time ror s Hent toleration of the radical left and right, 
black and white, is past. We must mobilize our hearts to the greatest 
challenge of mode rn war faro:! right in our own homes. This is guerrUa 
wa rfar e at its fines l. The pathway to peace will be paved by countless 
thousands of individlla l battles--battles ot our own conscience s, in our 
own minds . We can no longer retreat to our fortresses of bigotry, 
w, can no longe r supress a people's rights. The future lies in a unified 
nation- -black, red, white and ye llow togethe r. Until today we hav\! 
attacked this problem in total blindness, rejecting without thinking. 
The Negr o s ociety is one to which the white do not anrl cannot belong. 
We have ne ver, nor will eve r, be on the ins ide. Therefore, it only 
follo'NS that the Black mall .-:ome outside . All mll ::;t work togethe r . 

The Negro peoples have earned more than just the price of the 
admission ticket to society. They have suffered and died, jus t as 
whitey has, in the jungles and rice paddies of Viet Nam. Many N~groes 
have lived tor generations in the United States. They have mixed 
taxes and blood freely in our pursuit ot freedom and peace. Yet, we 
would accept an English or a German immigrant without a moments 
hesitation, whereas our own countrymen! are barred Irom equality. 
Why? Why is it that an offense committed by a Negro Is doubly damned? 
How can it be that our justice, which cannot differentiate between rich and 
poor, clean and dirty, can sense color? 

Our fellow Americans do not ask for pity, tor charity, but only for 
respect. Do they ask us to join hands? No. Do they a sk us to carry 
picket signs? No. They ask only to be recognized for what they are, 
individuals to be judged solely upon his or her own merits by his 
fellow man. It is . not for the white race to grant them their right or 
to apologize for previous failure to recognize them, but rather it is 
for us to realize the obligation that we accepted as Amp- r1cans in 1789, 
" •• • that all men are created equal," 

The riots were a blessing. they we re overdue. Now it is the time to 
apply the lesson they taught us.

still unresolved) discussion be-
tween the PreSident, the Faculty 
Committee and the Regents. 

Tile business cannot go on much 
longer without some resolution 
(perhaps an Acting Chancellor) 
but I know or no concrete de-
velopment suggesting that the 
selection of a new Chancellor 
could be completed by mid-May. 

hcidently, the selection of a 

new Chancellor is made by the

your story will prove to be cor-
rect.

Watson Speaks 
On Racism 

Dr. Joseph Watson, UCSD fa-
culty advisor for tbe Black Stu-
dents' Councll, and Mr. Kietb 
Lowe, acting Assistant Professor 
of Literature, talked with about 
forty people at last weeks's Jeri-
cho dialogue. "Black Nationalism 
and White Racism." Speaking at 
the University Lutheran Church, 
both men fielded a variety of 
questions dealing with law en-
forcement, education, and white 
attitudes. 

They described racism as not 
only supporting but also passively 
accepting oppression and injus-
tice as normal intoday's society. 
They contended that whites must 
change the attitudes of other 
whites if any improvement is to 
develop. This involves enlighten-
ing those who are Ignorant of the 
Black man's status and his prob-
lems . 

The two speakers cited the 
Black Nationalist Movement as a 
collective ideology of blackness 
which offers humanism whIch is 
totally lacking in today's uncivi-
lized ..... hUe society. The move-
ment now lvoids Integration be-
cause this require s that one ac-
cept white values and disregard 
his own black culture, and turn 
his back on his black brothers 
and s isters . 

Watson condemned the present 
law enforcement policies and of-
fered the suggestion to "get the 
cops off of our backs" and give 
black communities independence 
to solve their own problems and 
control their own lives. 

A final point was made that, 
educationally, students are taught 
in course s other than math and 
science that whites are respon-
sible for aU that has been, is, and 
will be done that is worthwhile. 
Watson mentioned that a course 
involving non-white contributions 
to world progress should be es-
tablished in the college curricu-
lum. Furthermore, high-school 
counselors should direct black 
students toward college educa-
tions rather than vocational 
training and education.

'New Politics'ls Subject 
Anthony Beilensen, candidate 

for US senator from California, 
and endorsed by the California 
De mocratic Council, spoke to 
UCSD students of the new poli-
tics that he feels is beginning to 
emerge in this country. This 
" new politics" is characte rized 
by an attitude that things that 
must be done in this country can 
be done if one puts his mind to 
it. He spoke of the need for 
national moralleadersbip. 

Beilensen is currently a State 
Senator Crom the 26th Senatorial 
District (Los Angeles). He was 
the author ot the controve rsial 
abortion bill that recently be-
came law, and has sponsored 
many bills designed for pro-
tecting consumer rights. Beilen-
sen is a me mber of California's 
slate of delegated pledged to 
McCarthy. 

communist conspiracy a s the re 
was in the 30's, but there are 
instead many dille rent types of 
communism. 

Beilensen would not s upport a 
unilateral withdrawal from Viet-
nam, s ince the US " mus t accept 
some ot the responsibility tor the 
mess it has created," Any with-
drawal must leave the basis for 
future political stability. 

Beilensen said that the atmos-
phere at Sacramento is very 
depressing at the moment. Ef-
forts to enact new legislation 
have been thwarted by a pre-
dominantly conservative legis la-
ture. As for Reagan, he was 
described as basically "a dis-
interested person." Howe ver, the 
senator felt that the political 
climate in the rest of the state 
was growing slightly better.

Senator McCarthy 
uLeadership of America 
Is 1968's Great Issue" 
(The following is the text of 
speech delivered by Senator Eu-
gene J . McCarthy at the Dane 
County Coliseum, Madison, Wis-
consin, March 25. It is the third 
in a se r ies of speeches made by 
pres idential candidates .) 

I entered the race for the 
Democratic Presidential nomi-
nation because the future of 
America is at s take in this elec-
tion year of 1968 . I enter ed be-
cause I believe the citizens of 
this nation deserve a choice, an 
alternative, to the po licies of war 
abroad , and deprivation at home 
that a re gu iding this nation. 

For the great issues of this 
election year ar e not only the 
war in Vietnam and the agony 
of our cities, but s omething much 
greater : the Quality ofleadership 
of this countr y. 

The nation has come, in some 
cases slowly, to realize that the 
problem of our minoritie s and 
cities are of almost overwhelm-
ing importance today- -and not a 
futile , seemingly endless war in 
Vietnam . Until recentl y, Presi-
dent 10hnson had assured us that 
we could tight both war s -o at home 
and in Southeast Asia. But two 
weeks ago he acknowledged what 
we have known for years- -that 
the nation must brace itse lf for 
aus terity, austerity br ought upon 
us by the 30 billion dollar s we 
spend each year in Vietnam. The 
President said fede ral programs 
would have to be cut by 8 or 9 
billion dollars. But auste rity, in 
this Administration, begins at 
the bottom--among the poor , the 
sick, and the distressed who are 
being asked to pay the pr ice of 
war. 

What kind of a man should be 
leading this bitte rly divided na-
tion--divided as it has not been 

c; ince the Civil War? 
I think any man who offer s 

himsel f for the Presidency muc;t 
meet three conditions of char-
acte r , exper ience ,and under-
standing. The President of the

some comprehension of what this

I a lso have some under standing 
of where this country should be

greater power or influence than 
that entrusted by the people to 
their Pres ident. The President 
should understand that this na-
lion doesn't r eally have s o great 
a need for leadership, because 
the potentia I for leader s hip ex-

President, instead of asserting 
leadership, must be prepar ed to 
be but a channel for the des ires 
and aspirations of the people. He 
must guide the nation to the goals 
its people seek- -and never im -
pose the right of office upon 
them. 

Finally, the office of the Pres-

never be a personal office . The

Beilensen described our pre-

sent course as one that is " drift-
ing towards disaster." Currently 
military spending is five times 
as large as domestic spending. 
This ration. he telt, must be re-
versed, for the first priority 
should always be people, starting 
with the people here in the US. 
"For the first time in history, 
Beilensen stated, "people have 
the wealth and means to eliminate 
poverty." 

Sheerin Talks on War and Draft 

The immediate resolution of 
the Vietnam war should be our 
tirst priority at the moment. how-
ever. "I am sick of talking about 
it," he said. "Even though we're 
negotiating now, we are not slow-
ing down action there." 

The se nato r felt that it rna y

this war to learn the conse-

vent religious anti-communIst 
attitude of many Americans. It

Father Sheerin, a priest ot the 
Catholic Church, spoke to a very 
concerned audience last week on 
the subject of his feelings re-
garding the war in Vietnam and 
the American participation there. 
In bis speech, he said. that the 
United States has no business in 
the war because it is a civil con-
mct and we are not wanted there~ 

Father Sheerin's talk centered 
around two maIn areas, the war 
and the drafting of young men to 
fight in that war. Sheerin is a-
gainst both of these policies but 
teels that, as a priest, be can 
only advise men of draft age to 
follow the dictates of their con-
science with regard to deciding 
whether to serve in the armed 
forces and possibly fight in Viet-
nat 

In his first r emarks about the 
war, Father Sheerin voiced the 
opinions of many people who feel 
that the war is unjust, immoral, 
and 11legal. After giving a short 
recitation of Vietnamese history 
following the French ~efeat at 
Dlenbienphu, he pointed out how 
involved the U.S. has become in 
the affairs of the Vieinamese 
people and their many gov rn-
ments. His words on the Quality 
of the South Vietnamese govern-
ments indicated his unfavorable 
impression of them. 

Following this historical out-
line, sheerin gave his opinions on 
the current political situation in 
Vietnam and what the benefits of 
the conflict are versus the great 
damage the war is doing in terms 
of lives, and property. He also 
said that the .. just war" theory 
has value but that it has been 
greaUy misused since the two 
world wars. in a more general 

refiection, Sheerin remarked that 
communism is not the great evil 
we think it is today, but has 
value in certain instances. 
Whether Vietnam is one of them, 
be failed to say. 

Father Sheerin related his 
opinions concerning the draft and 

the draft laws . "Super general 
Her shey" is without r espect for 
the consciences of other s , which 
must be respected at aU times, 
he said. The great dilemma now 
facing young men of military age 
is that of United States civil law 
or their personal conscience.

"Happening " 
Speaks 

Creator 

Allan Kaprow, internationally 
known for his development of 
"happenings," will be a Regents' 
Professor on campus next week . 

Kaprow will participate in 
"N~w Art Week," sponsored by 
the UCSD Departments of Music 
and Visual Arts, through 15 May. 
Culminating the week-ong sched-
ule will probably be a happening 
on Tuesday, May 14. It is rumored 
that it will be held on Scripps 
Beach 

Two seminar s will be held 
today and MOll<1ay at 4 p.m. in 
USB 3070. 

Kaprow tlas deCined a "hap-
pening" as "an assemblage ot 
events performed or perceived 
in more than one time and place. 
Its material environments maybe 
const ructed, taken over directly 
from what is available or altered 
slightly; just as its activities may 
be invented or commonplace . A 

happening, unllke a stage play, 
may occur at a supermark e t, 
driving along a highway, under 
a pile ot rags, and in a friend's 
kitchen, either at once or sequen-
tially time may extend to more 
than a year. The happening is 
performed according to plan but 
without rehearsal, audience or 
repetition. It Is art but seems clo-
ser to life." 

A graduate of New York Uni-
versity, with his masters degree 
in Art History trom Culumbia 
University, Kaprow has a dis-
tinguished background as a tea-
cher and an artist. He has taught 
at Rutgers Univer sity. Pratt Uni- • 
ver sity, State Univers ity of New 
York and the Institute ot Con-
temporary Arts in Boston. He has 
had solo exhibits throughout the 
world, from New York's Guggen-
heim Museum to museums in 
stockholm, Amsterdam and Ham-
burg. 

T.A.'s Speak Out on Humanities 
by Susa n Adams 

The reactions of several T.A.s 
to the April 19 ar ticle, "Students 
Evaluate T .A.s", werlj s.;>mewhat 
unexpected and certainly provoc· 
alive. It seems that Larry Dor· 
man. Jerry Press, Rober ta Sar· 
fatt and Carol Sweedleragree that 
the humanities program is con-
ceptually good but in practice 
taIls short of its professed ob-
jectives. 

Mr~. Sarfatt said she'd e xpect-
ed the article to be "dangerous", 
but instead ofintrOducingcontro-
versial issues, it tries to be 
safe. She wanted to know whe-
ther students were in favor of 
discussing current problems in 
place of the material. There are 
apparently two views among 
T.A.s concerning this question. 
One is that the sequence should 
develop criticial attitudes enab-
ling students to see prejudices 
in any work, and that this is 
best accompUshed by consider-
ing books removed tram our time. 
n was pointed out that students 
do not learn the past to pro-
pagandize about current Issues. 
Mrs. Sarfatt teels that it would 
be presumptuous of her to tell 
students what they should commit 
their lives to. On the other hand, 
a student claimed that he got an 
A from his T.A. because he was 
aginst the war. 
All agreed, however, that mak-
ing the material relevant in some 
way Is necessary, whether in the 
classroom or out. According to 
Jerry Press, "learning really 
starts and probably ends at mak-
ing the material relevant." What 
happens in between is the process 
of education. Mr. Dorman said 
that one encounters aperson--the 
author--in every work read and 
that one should be subjective 
and judge oneself by that man's 
experience. 

Jerry Press commented on the 
lack of emphasis on student re-
sponsibility in the article. A 
stude nt's thing is to know the 
material. He must expect to find 
value tram the books--be sym-
pathetic to them. The purpose 
oC humanities, says Mr. Dorman, 
"Is to show that cash value Isn't 
the whole thing--students should 
leave it with a love tor thpse 
sort of books. Education is some-
thing you do to yourself," and 
is students feel that sections are 

lousy, they should take it upon 
themse lves to provoke discussion 
by their questions. 

Mrs. Sarlatt finds that real 
education happens not when stu-
dents are lectured to but when 
people talk, bringing out their 
ideas anci relaUngthem. Her sec-
tions, like the other's, are pri-
marlly discussion. Mr. Press' 
biggest criticism of undergrad-
uates on this campus is that they 
see learning intrinsically related 
to tables, blackboards, and T.A.s 
and professors, sine qua non. 
Plato has said that the bad thing 
about books is that they can't 
answer back; confrontation and 
fluidity of ideas happens best 
when the material is discussed 
and related outside the class-
room. 

Carol Sweedler commented 
that it is also the responsib1l!ty 
ot the T.A.s and lecturers to 
make the students want to go 
home and read the books. She 
believes that T.A.s are not al-
ways conscientious, do not read 
the mate rial and substitute dis-
cussion of the cafeteria crisis 
or A.S. elections for discussion 
at the books. Jerry Press, too, 
criticizes T.A.s who themselves 
do not take the sequence seri-
ously, who are not available e-
nough or prepared and who might 
contradict the professor simply 
because they didn't know what 
he really said. A course in tea-
ching was suggested tor T.A.s 
"before they are let loose in a 
roomful of undergraduates." 

When the fact that T.A.s are 
not consistent was mentioned, 
Mrs. Sweedler thought that it wa.~ 
good in a sense. While she ad-
vocates maintaining, standards 
she said, "Education is about 
you as a total person", and if 
you occasionaly get a good grade 
because you're charming, per-
haps that is part of it. 

The difference between content 
and torm was found to be gen-
erally meaningless by the T .A.s. 
Caro I Sweedler said that the 
meaning was Imbued with the 
form. 
n was indicated by several 

of the T.A.s that the depart-
ments look on the humanities 
sequence only as an obligation 
to be fulfilled and thus the send 

in anyone available, regardless 
of their qualiticatlons to teach 
a specific period. 

Another universal criticism 
was the lack of organizing prin-
ciple. As Jerry Press said, "}fow 
can a student be expected to see 
how things have progressed over 
2600 years when professors and 
T.A.s can not. Dorman said that 
the courses should be structured 
around a problem rather than the 
books. 

Mr. Press discussed how un-
realisitic it was to expect a T.A. 
to spend only 20 hours a week 
for 2 sectlons, allowing 15 min-
utes for conferences and 20 min-
utes to correct papers. Since it 
appears that discussions are con-
sidered more real and valuable 
than the lectures, Press also 
suggested that perhaps one 1 1/2 
hour lecture and 2 sections a week 
would be more benefiCial. 

The problems and deficiencies 
are recognized and acknowledged 
by the majority. Of course, as 
Mr. Press states, the criticisms 
are mitigated by the fact that 
everyone has other responsibil-
ities. However, he believes this 
is a "mistake we let the system 
impose on us--It is not inevit-
able or intrinsic." 

The T.A.s have attempted to 
eUect change but are met with 
the objection, • 'Well, the students 
don~t seem to mind." T.A.s like 
Roberta Sarfatt asked tor criti-
cisms and recommendations and 
really wants them--but there is 
little if any response. She would 
like to see these issues open 
into a real debate . According to 
Jerry Press, grad T.As would 
make demands it they knew the 
students would suport them. 
"Students should start to mutter 
out loud. It They can let their 
professors know what they feel 
is lacking in their classes, and 
can go to the Ij..S. government, 
which indicates an ability and 
willingness to get things done this 
year and who can communicate 
with the faculty better than in-
dividual students. They Should 
"recognize and do something 
about the organic whole they're· 
in." 

Further comments from stu-
dents or T .A.s --dIrected to the 
paper or to the T.A.s--a re wel-
come.

Remains Popular 

Sunday, May 5, the Turnau 
Opera Players presented Gloac-
chino Rossini's "The Barber of 
Seville," at Sherwood Hall. The 
opera was performed in a new 
English adaptation which taith-
fully reproduced the vigor of Ros-
sini's libretto. Even though Sher-
wood Hall does not provide ap-
propriate facilities for the pre-
sentation of an opera, the aud-
ience was nevertheless delighted 
by the singer's enthusiasm, as 
was evidenced by the hearty 
though ill- timed applause. 

The strong-singing perform-
ances by the master schemer 
Figaro and the old WOUld-be lov-
er Doctor Bartollo were support-
ed by the hilar iolls.aclingotmus-
Ic instructor Don Basilio and the 
personal charm of the beautiful 
Rossina. Anthony Saflna, playing 
the part of Count Almavlva, lett 
much to be desired since at 
various time s it was very dif-
!lcult to understand him. Special 
recognition must be given to Lor-
ine Buffington who played the 
part of the maid, Berta; her role 
was small, her singing and acting 
were truly delightlul. 

Nevertheless, the overall pre-
sentation was enjoyable, since the 
singing deficiencies were aptly 
overcome by the comic effects 
ot Don Basllio's and Dr. Bar-
tolo's acting. The lack of an 
orchestra was also partly sur-
mounted by the plano accom-
paniment ot Lloyd Walser. 

Second Muir 
Building Begun 

Groundbreaking ceremonies 
for Buldling 2B. the second 
building to begin construction 
in John Muir College at the 
University of California in La 
Jolla, was held last week at 
the building site just north at 
Miramar Road. 

Building 2B Is 'a !lve-story 
concrete structure with tull 
basement which will provide 
46,000 square teet of space for 
undergraduate and graduate bi-
ology classrooms, biology re-
search laboratories, and the John 
Muir College administrative of-
fices. Award of the construction 
contract tor the $2.5 million 
building to the M.H. Golden Con-
struction Company of San Diego 
was announced this week by Rob-
ert Biron, Vice-Chancellor of 
Administratlon at UCSO. 

The complex of permanent 
buildings for John Muir College 
the second college to begin class-
es at UCSD, was be~un May 26, 
1967 with the start of construction 
of a seven-Gtory laboratory and 
classroom building for the De-
partments at Electrophysics and 
Mathematics and the UCSD Com-
puter Center.

A. S. Senate Notes 
by Roger Sha wley 

Mystery clouded the first meeting of the AS Senate last Wednesday 
as Tom Shepard, at the request of Dean Murphy, called the newly-
elected body into Executive Session. Only the Senators, outcers 
and secretary at the Senate plus the dean and faculty representative 
were permitted to partiCipate. The subject ot the closed session, 
which was never held in the previous administration, is being held 
in strictest contldence by all concerned. 

Once the meeting was opened, several resolutions were passed. 
On B111 Eastman's motion, the Senate agreed to allow the Campus 
Drat! Opposition Comm ittee at the Berkeley ca.mpus to add the 
ASUCSD's endorsement to a statement questioning the Regents' recent 
decision to torbid a commencement exercise concerned with the 
drat!. The ceremony, to be held in the Greek Theatre at Berkeley, 
where the traditional services are beld at the end of the academic year, 
was to honor stUdents who had agreed to oppose the dratt and those 
who had chosen to pledge s'~PlJort. The question was whether the Re-
gents were breaking their ow.) rules by forbidding the expression of 
free speech. The blank-check endorsement by the Senate was made 
without regard to its clntent, which will be worked out in Berkeley. 
The motion was carried 5 to 3, with Paul Ricks, steve Ishmael and 
steve Greenberg opposed. 

Paul Ricks announced that the negotiations for a new contract for 
food services on campus would reach a critical stage next week and 
asked that the AS become involved in the formulation of the contract. 
He will meet with Bill Borasri from the Business office and any other 
interested s tudents to discuss the selection of a company for the Fall. 

Ricks also urged the Senate to consider a Town Hall meeting for the 
present quarter since it was favored by so many of the candidates 
during the campaign. The matter will be brought up at next week's 
meeting. 

Concerning the AS Judicial Board, Eastman proposed that the 
Senators bring candidates lor the positions to next week's meeting 
so that the Board can be filled as soon as possible. 

The most controve4sial part of the open session was a motion to 
recommend to the Revelle COSA to test amplification equipment on 
the Revelle Plaza at a hearing on college government next Monday 
or Tuesday. Dean Hull questioned whether such a change in COSA's 
plans would achieve the objective or the hearings, at which students 
and faculty will discuss particular feature ot the plan. Jeff Ben-
jamin, Tom Baer and Tom Peiffer held that the hearing would be 
more effective outside where more students would be inclined to listen

CHANCE LLOR JOHN GALBHAITI< -Staff Photo 

Galbraith Defines 

Chancellor's Duties 
by Susan Adams 

Ideally, a university would em-
body nuid relationships between 
administration, faculty, and stu-
dents, according to Chancellor 
John Galbraith. A harmonious set 
of values would result from the 
realization that all elements were 
promoting a commo;} objective--
the stimulation of a fre e intel-
lectual environment. 

The particu lar role of the chan-
cellor was further elucidated by 
Dr. Galbraith. The chancellor has 
more authority today than two 
years ago; however, he exercises 
this authority with advice. He is 
obliged to listen to faculty com-
mittees on such matters as edu-
cational policy and to student-
faculty committees on campus 
planning, student conduct and 
fees, public ceremonies and arts 
and lectures, although the final 
decision is his responsibility. 

Students must understand that 
they as well as administrators 
must be willing to listen and to 
expend time if they wish to effect 
change. Galbraith doe& not be-
lieve that the chancellor's power 
should be absolute; he is not 
"desirous of creating a philoso-
pher-king", since one would 
probably not remain a philoso-
pher if he became absolute king. 

understanding of the academic 
liCe. The University is like no 
other institution. It must do more 
than produce people qualified Cor 
jobs." 

Galbraith indicated that one 
other qualification for a chan-
cellor is that he be a maso-
chistic, since he is in a position 
to get it from all sides. But, he 
adrled. it is part of the job which 
he has found fascinating because 
it is involved in the process of 
creating. When he came to UCSD 
he believed that it had "as bril-
liant a prospect as anywhere in 
the country." The difference be-
tween '64 and '68 is that we 
are now closer to realization of 
that prospect. 

Galbraith said be hoped a more 
positive feeling for this campus 
would develop witbin the student 
body--"A sense of pride in what 
I think is an outstanding educa-
tional institution--a manifesta-
tion of the sense of belonging 
here." 

When asked what suggestions 
wou ld be offered to a successor, 
Chancellor Galbraith suggested: 
"Be of good cheer. Be resolute. 
And take up volleyball-'--when 
one is frustrated it serves as an 
excellent catharsis.

that must be ratified by the Re-
velle faculty and students." 

Speaking from the point of 
view of the campus· wide As-
sociated Students, Tom Shepard 
emphasized that UCSD's unique 
nature demands a dtlferent sort 
of student organization. 

"What can the relation be-
tween 27,000 students and 12 
different colleges be in 1990," 
he asked. "Traditional AS gov-
ernment cannot work at this 
school. We sbould take advantage 
of our diffe rent structure and 
make the AS more effective." 

Shepard defined concern to be 
in those things which the colleges 
cannot financially support. "A 
college cannot support a news-
pape r or a radlO station. It can-
not speak for the University of 
California at San Diego in con-
demning something in the out-
side commu lty." 

In his ad minl stration, however, 
he warned that he would not allow 
the "AS to act at the expense of 
the college s so as to de stroy the 
identity of the colleges." 

"Some think college govern-
ment will subvert student gove rn-
mellt and effectiveness. But a 
student (at Revelle) is primarily 
a student at (his college). The 
college should be his main con-
cern. Student power lies with the 
individual and it is in an in-
tegrated community--the col-
lege--that his power can be ef-
fective." 

Bob Boyd, a member of the 
Revelle Interhall Council. said 

Leadership 

that students can only achieve 
decision-making power by "re-
liably influencing" the Provost's 
deCiSions, we have stUdent pow-
er." 

Referring to the recent up-
heavals at Columbia University. 
Boyd said that "coercion is the 
destructive way (to student pow-
er) but is not the way to do it. 
It is absolute Iy inflexible be-
cause it brings the system to a 
halt." 

Assuming that student opinion 
is manifest in those who march, 
Boyd said that the "more demo-
cratic" way is to elect spokes-
men who will reflect student 
opinion. 

"Without the respect for the 
student body," be concluded, "the 
Provost will reject the total col-
lege opinion." COSA's govern-
ment will allow the Provost to 
make "reliable decisions." 

The faculty representative 
speaking at the convoeation,'Or. 
Walter Kohn of tbe Physics De-
partment, spoke of the "break-
down after 1000 years of schol-
astic tradition in the academic 
comm1lnity" in spite ofthe" good 
things that have resulted from 
confrontations" between students 
and administrators. 

The college system, Kohn im-
plied, helps to avoid the break-
down of the universities. 

"Experimentation and innova-
tion is very much easier (at the 
college level) than in the eight 
other big monolithic colleges 
(sic) (of the Unlversity of Cali-
fornia). New ideas can be put into

The role of the Presidency--

at all ti meso but especially in 
1968--must be one of uniting 
this nation. not one of adding it 
up in some way. not one of putting 
it together in bits and pieces, and 
not one of organizing it. The need 
of America is not a need for 
organization , but a need to de-

"The college plan offers much

tionships one finds in large cam-

today's world. 

Provost SaUman consluded the 
hour-long convocation by expos-
ing the charred remains of the 
COSA plan which he had (ound on 
his door in an envelope Monday

"I hope this is not the fewUng

Partch Concert 
in Unique Music 
A concert by noted composer 

Harry Partch will be presented 
in the University of Cal ifornIa, 
San Diego Art Gallery on Satur-
day and Sunday, May 11 and May 
12 at 8:30 p.m. The programs 
is sponsored by he UCSD De-
partment of Music, where Par-
tcb was Regents ' Professor dur-
ing the fall quarter, 1967 . 

In the past 40 years Partch 
has been wr iting in his highly 
individualized style tor instru-
ments uniquely his own. As a 
young American composer, Par-
tch rejected at least one of tbe 
mainstays oC western mUSiC, the 
"equal temperament" tuning 
system of 12 tones to the oc-
tave, in favor of a system oC 
scales based on "just intona-
tion", an acoustical division ot 
the octave into 43 or moretones. 
In his book "Genesis of Mu sic", 
published by the University of 
Wisconsin Press, Partch sets 
Corth the principles of his theo-
retical system, which offers 
"pure" intervals and exotic sca-
les not possible in conventional 
western music. 

One specific duty of the chan-
cellor is representing the urit-
versity to Ihe community. Dr. 
ea:braith sees somethhg of a 
paradox; the university is created 
by the society, but is often criti-
cal of thos~ who support it. It is 
difficult for some to understand. 

~<;pecially in such periods of 
st r~ss as the present, that the 
University by its natu!'>! sh,lIll1

sodety.

Also reflecting the composer's

Five more University of Cali-

fornia scientists today were 
elected to the National Academy 
of Sciences, raising UC's mem-
bership to more than 100 mem-
bers, largest ever from any 
single institution. 

Election is conside red to be 
one of the highest honors that can 
be accorded an American scien-
tist or engineer. Members are 
elected in recognition of distin-
guished and continuing achieve-
ments in original research. 
Hto;;.rly O!,P of every eight mem-
bers is from UC. 

The new UC members are Pro-
fessors Louis G. Henyey, astron-
omy, and John H. Reynolds , phys-
ics, both at Berkeley; Henry W. 
Menard, Jr., geology, and Wil-
liam Prager , applied mechanics, 
both at San Diego, and Edward A. 
Steinhaus, organic biology, at 
Irvine . The five new UC mem-
bers are among 50 elected na-
tionally and among 10 from the 
state of California. 

The election took place in 
Washington D. C. at the 10jth 
annllal meeting. The academy, 
which was e ablished in 1863, 
is a private organization of 806 

Academy 
members dedicated to the fur-
therance of science and its use 
for the general welfare. 

The two new members from 
Berkeley give that campus a 
total of 54 members, second 
only to Harvard. The San Diego 
campus now has 20 members 
and Irvine 2. 

Dr. Henyey, former chairman 
of Berkeley's astronomy depart-
ment, developed techniques for 
computer-aided studies of the 
structure and evolution of stars, 
techniques which are in wide-
spread use among astronomers 
today. 

Dr. Reynolds' reseirch helped 
establish the nature and timing 
of events in the universe before 
the earth was formed, and added 
to knowledge about the sequence 
of deve lopments in our solar 
system. 

Dr. Menard discovered a long-
sought area in mid-Pacific where 
a major under-water mountain 
chain had axisted 100 million 
years go. He is stationed at 
the Scripps Institution oC Ocean-
ography and is acting director 
of the Institute of MarIne Re-
sou rces.

A philosophy of music has 
grown out of his acthe concern 
for communication between him-
self and other s as he tells stor-
ies using mu sic, drama anrt 
dance. He aims at a "total thea-
tre" objective and often uses 
films in his work. Not wanting 
to be confined to a musical tra-
dition of European tastes and 
styles, Partch believes Ina music

on run on 3 hits, with one error, 
whUe Riverside got 2 runs on 
3 hits with 1 error, in the first 
game. 

In the second game, the Tritons 
came back much stronger, but 
could not put down a Riverside 
squad that got 7 runs on only 
6 hits. UCSD went 50% with 4 
runs on 8 hits, and 3 errors. 

The winning pitchers for UCR 
were Constable and Zuk; for the

Tritons Begin Assa ut, On Record s 
Now that there are only three 

weeks lett in the Triton running 
schedule, the UCSD squad is on 
its tina I stages of assualt on the 
record books. The free-for-all 
ectort officially started last Sa-
turday at the 14th Annual Orange 
Invitational Track Meet held at 
Chapman College. Tbe thinclads 
')uccessfully rewrote two of the 
existing school records without 
any trouble and almost eradicated 
several others. 

The day started out with pre-
liminary heats in all but the dis-
tance races and the mile relay, 
meaning that most of the Triton 
runners were in two races for 
each event. The fir st race of the 
day set the firstrecordoftbe day, 
the 440 yd intermediate hurdles 
by Tom Gatlin. J-lavingbroken the 
old stanrta rd three times this 
season, Gatlin easily coasted to 
victory in his heat with a 57 .2 
second clocking, well under hIs 
previous mar k of 58.5. He hopes 
to drop the mark even more in 
the next meel. 

Tom Wolt~ , displaying his U5 -
ual brlllance on the track as well 
as on tbe jumping runways, placed 
second in his heat of the 100 yd. 
dash in a time ot 10.3 seconds. 
Returning to the finals with an 
injured hamstring muscle, Wolle

still managed to place fourth. 
in a time of 10.1 sec., acing out 
cross-town rival Mike Turnip-
seed of Cal-Western, who later 
complained he had pulled his 
hamstring during the race. 

The 440 relay team of Jerry

Tom Wolfe, and Dave Kuhn gave 
theIr best showing of the year

Soccer Team Holds 
First Practice Game 

Thursday, May 9, the UCSD 
varisty soccer team held its 
first practice game 01 tbe season 
against Southwestern College in 
Chula Vista. The scrimmage was 
designed to give the Triton 
kickers experience for tbe game 
which will be held thL') Saturday, 
and an opportunity for Coach 
SaroIli to see his players in 
action. 

Among the players whom Dr. 
Sarolll watched espec ially close-
ly wer~ Bill Cobern, playing 
right wing; Allen Jones anrt Gary 
Bogue playing fullback , and the 
teams goallle Dan Schickele. All 
four are tirst year players who 
will be an integral part in tbe 
teams performance in future 
games. 

Dr. Sarolll is at present at-
tempting to schedule mora prac-

lice gamas tor the coming weeks 
so that tbe playe rs can gain 
maximum experience in the diff-
icult formation devised by 
Sarolli. The team wi 1I use a 
3-2-3-2 line-up which combines 
the be s t aspects of va r ious soc-
cer styles. The outstanding fea-
ture of this form of play is the 
use of two center for war.js in-
stead of one which is usually 
used. 

At present, the team is still 
searching for added talent to 
bolster their offesive line, and 
the left half-back position. Any-
one inte rested in joining the squad 
is welcome to attend the work-
outs which are held Monday, Wed-

With all the breakc; going to 

UCSD in the early portion oC the 
meet in wac; a sad day for two or 
the team me moors. The fir ::;t 
tough break came wh'~n Eric 
Yeumaa, who ' lready WCl. '; run-
ning on one sprained ankle re-
ceived earlier in the week, hit 
a hurdle in the 440 intermediates 
and sprained the othe r in the 
Call . How~ {e', with both ankles 
taped ve r y l,, ' avHy, he was still 
prepared to ( 0 battle in the mite 
relay until, Jo to the long walt 
between everts, the sWE: Uing fi-
nally got tr him. It is hoped 
that after a Neeks rest he wUl 
be able to rd l'n tc l{!t!ve fJ, Ity 
At least CO,l :h Johnso:J hopes s') 
because he i; entered in at least 
four events t lis Saturday 

The other rd luck case of 
the day cam ~ in the 4 ~o yd dash 
prelims whell Triton r unne r Marc 
R'Jthmatl wa'; denied the oppor-
tunity to ru'! in the finals later 
that day. Havin6 run a better 
timp. thrn the tw', lonp runners 
in he Collo 'Ning heat, the Ju Jges 
d ~cjde ' l that Duug Parson of Pep-

~rdlDe, wll/) ran the same time 
as Rothman, would be the seventh 
rna 1 to run in the finals . There 
Wf.!re originally to be six men 
to qualley ( llrst two In e ch heat), 
but due to another tie In the lirst 

race (faster time) they could take 
seven but no more because ofthe 
number oC lanes. Not oniy was 
Marc dismayed at the decision 
but also his coach, Richard John-
son. Both are awaiting Saturday's 
quarter race at UC Riverside. 

The field events tell another 
s tory, a good one. Lons jumper 
Tom Wolfe, easily won the con-
test of the sand pit with a leap 
of 22'7" with teamate Jerry Nier-
engarten placing 5th at 20'4" . 
Steve Gai'folo, the nymph of the 
discus ring, won a big second in 
that event with mate Roy Dimon 
right on his tail in third . The 
pole vault foursome oC Dent, 
Burdick, Bright, and Dower were 
in better than average shape when 
tt,ey f!!,~l)y ha at least one pole 
Cor each man to jump with. Jim 
!Jent placed 3rd at 12'6" with 
Burdick in 5th at the same height 
by ruling of fewer misses. 

The distances races provid d 
the final record of the day with 
Warren Kumley's mile prefor-
mailce. Warren bravely [ollowed 

very swift pace set by Mike 
Eck of Cal-State Fullerton to the 
new school record of 4: 25 .6. Eck 
broke his u.vn record tn that race 
by running 4: 12. Jay "The Rabbi"

NEW IDEAS -{;ONSTANTLY 
appear on the theological scene. 
One of the latest and most con-
troversial Is expressed in The 
Passover Plot, a best seller by 
Dr. Hugh Schonfield. He asserts 
"that Jesus planned his own ar-
rest, crucifixion and resurrec-
tion; that he arranged to be drug-
ged on the cros~ simulating death 
so that he could later be safely re-
moved and thus bear out the 
Messianic prophecies" (from the 
cover). 

Tonight, Friday May 10, at 
8:00 pm in USB 2622 a panel will 
brietly review and then evaluate 
Dr. Schonfield's hypothesis. Dr. 
Jim Kennedy of Salk Institute, 
Dr. Frank Young of Scripps Clin-
ic, and Dr. George Ladd of Ful-
ler Theological Seminary will 
be on the panel and will answer 
questions alter their presenta-
tions. Dr. Young, a former path-
ologist, will examine the causes 
of the death of Jesus, and Dr • 
Schonfield's theory. Dr. Ladd 
was well received when he spoke 
here at UCSD as part of the ex-
tention program.
