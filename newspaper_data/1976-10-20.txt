Unofficial Meetin ?

Revelle College : the academic 
home (laboratory) of hunched over 
elderly male scientists; the student 
breeding ground for future doctors, 
physicists, and chemists; the in-
stitution that attracts the 
calculator class, the mechanical 
minds, the neurotic nerds. Those 
are the stereotypes. 

Dr. June Louin Tapp, the new 
Revelle Provost, is an exception, a 
"null set" if you will, to most of the 
supposed Revelle personifications. 

The first woman provost to take 
control of a UCSD college, Tapp is 
a social scientist who obtained her 
undergraduate degree in sociology 
and doctorate in psychology. Over 
a noteworthy teaching career that 
has spanned close to 20 years and 
several universities, Tapp has 
pursued an interest in research 
psychology and law, often being 
able to use one to complement the 
other.

University of Minnesota, where 

Board, McElroy Still at Odds 
by Alec Nedelman 

Associate News EdItor 

The controversy surrounding 
Chancellor McElroy's charge to 
the UCSD Elections Board ''to 
conduct a campus-wide referen-
dum o~ student governance this 
fall quarter" was not abated by the 
first meeting of the Board last 
Friday. 

The meeting was termed 
unofficial by one board member, 
who w;.shed to remain anonymous, 
because it " was called by the 
Chancellor." It was alleged at the 
meeting that this was one of the 
reasons the three new Coop 
representatives to the Board did 
not attend Friday's meeting. 

The meeting was called 
however, according to Vice-
chancellor and Dean of Student 
Affairs George Murphy, by one of 
the students on the board at the 
Chancellor's request. 

Much of the controversy con-
cerns McElroy's right to call for a 
referendum. McElroy, in '. letter to 
the Elections Board, stF . ..ed that his 
call for a referendllJll has two 
bases. He cited University pollcy 
which authorizes chancellors "to 
establish . or continue student 
governments as official units of the 
University." This reference is to 
Section VI, Part A of the Univer-
sity of California handbook on 
Policies Applying to Campus 
Activities, Organizations and 
Students. 

McElroy Understanding 
McElroy also pointed to an 

understanding he said he has 
reached with the Coop over the last 
two years. That understanding 
dictates that McElroy not 
" establish the Student Cooperative 
Union, by default, as this campus' 
pennanent student government. I 
would violate ... the Coop's own 
conunitment to turn to students for 

Police, Tas~ Force Express 
Concern Over Rape Victims 

by Laura Richter 
Staff Wrlter 

A woman hastens down a dark 
path between Muir College and the 
Central Ubrary, after a long night 
of studying. She's scared, and with 
good reason. There were three 
reported rapes on the UCSD 
campus last year, and this Is a very 
low estimate of the actual number. 

The campus pollee' are aware 
that other rapes take place on 
campus every year, but that the 
victims have not informed officials 
for a variety of reasons. Many 
women fear the in-depth 
questioning they must undergo in 
order to build a solid case against 
the offender. Others feel that police 
procedure are simply d signed to 
ridicul the victim. Some a re 
, imply too up: t to take action.

Because of her extensive training 
and her own personal experience 
with rape, she realized the need for 
several actiom to be taken. 

Del Drago felt that the campus 
police - who, she said, have no 
women officers - lacked sen-
sitivity training. She said medical 
assistance needed to be obtained 
and psychological counseling 
made available for victims and 
their families. 

"Cooperative, IDtereated 
lad Helpful" 

Del Drago found the response to 
her caU for action very favorable. 
She termed the Campus Police 
" cooperative, interested and 
helpful." They participated in an 
awarene ession led by Judy

its legitimacy. (That commitment, 
as you may recall, was reiterated 
in the spring of 1975 after the 
referendum vote to continue the 
Coop experiment. ) " 

Some board members, 
however, are vehement in their 
opposition to the Chancellor's call 
for the referendum. Although they 
agree with McElroy that the board 
should decide "what minimum 
number of students voting should 
be fixed in advance of the balloting 
(if any) and what fraction of those 
voting should be required to 
determine the 'winning model,' 
they feel the board alone has the 
authority to caU for a referendum. 

Muir board rep Andy Schneider 
said last week "Students alone hold 
the power and authority to 
organize a student governance 
structure." Schneider claimed that 
McElroy has violated Eleolion 
Board Code of Procedure, which 
details that a referendum may only 
be instituted upon request from a 
petition signed by either twenty 
percent of all registered students, 
or by three out of the five student 
govenunents - the college councils 
and the Student Cooperative 
Union. 

ds f tim 

she had been a professor of child 
psychology and crirriinal justice 
studies, was termed a " tough one." 
In choosing to come to Revelle she 
established quite a commuting 
distance between her husband and 
herself, as he remains a professor 
of humanities at the University of 
Minnesota. 

" Because of the many problems . 
involved I would never have ac-
cepted the role of Revelle Provost 
except that it was so tantalizing," 
said Tapp. Laughing she admitted 
that the job was in some ways "an 
ideal research setting in which my 
social science skills might do me 
service." 

Impressed by the college and 
overall university, Tapp is ' ex-
cited" by the many possibilities. 
"We can be part of something 
special," she said. " We have the 
setting and the school to make 
everything happen." 

Though she has only been on the 
job for six weeks, Tapp said that, 
" in spite of everything being 
hectic , it's been enjoyable ." 
Having never had a similar ad-

ministrative post, m uch of Tapp's 
time has been spent in "getting 
acquainted." As provost, she has 
found it necessary to become in-
volved with " virtua lly everything 
dealing with the life of the 
college. " 

" What we have is a v ry com-
plex institution," said Tapp. " In 
order for me to be effective in my 
post as head of the college, I need 
an understanding of the problems 
and general affairs that face us. 
Knowing the terrain around me 
will make for better choices." 

Tapp feels that colleges and 
universities are "one of the last 
bastions of value-creating in-
stitutions. " Believing that it is 
essential to develop the individual 
potential, she feels most of all that, 
"college should be a liberating 
experience. " 

"Experiments show you that 
ants and rats can learn," said 
Tapp, " but the human learning 
process system should be much 
different." She will soon by studing

UCSD Charged with Misuse 
Of Federal Grants by HEW 

At the moment, the federal 
goverrunent and UCSD are not 
seeing eye to eye over " adequate 
documentation" of federal grants. 

The " slight" controversy has 
resulted in the Department of · 
Health, Education, and Welfare's 
charging UCSD with misusing 
federal grants in the neighborhood 
of $250,000, and because of this, the 
goverrunent is demanding the 
money back. 

As might be expected, the 
university has appealed the 
decision, saying that the problem 
stems from "bookkeeping . 
methods." 

For the past year federal 
auditors have been researching the 
gra..nts given out to schools in the 
University of California system. As 
a result, HEW has requested a 
refund of $&21,000. 

" A Misunders tanding?" 
Chancellor McElroy has termed 

the entire situation " a misun-
derstanding." He noted that the 
amount in dispute ($250,000) was 
just " a small fraction of the total 
annual federal support for 
research at UCSD ($80,000,000)." 

Although r.tcElroy questioned 
the governmental charges, he said 
that, "to the extent that there has 
been actual failures of compliance 
with federal accounting 
requirements, UCSD will modify 
its procedures appropriately." 

Part of the problem is seen to 
have stemmed from researchers. 
"suddenly" using up all of their 

grants money just before t!le grant 
was scheduled to expire. Auditors 
say that the money should have 
been returned to the federal 
government. 

McElroy stated that, " the dif-
ferences between the federal 
auditor and UCSD are matters of 
accounting procedure and 
auditors' opinions are being ap-
pealed as permitted by law." 

McElroy, in a Sept., 1976 article 
in Science Magazine, noted that the 
problem of funding between 
Washington and the nation ' s 
universities was getting worse. He . 
wrote that, "now we view each 
other with suspicion, almost as 
adversaries. We overregulate on 
one hand and overreact on the 
other. We have placed our part-
nership in peril. And if it 's to be 
restored, • it" urgently needs our 
attention and understanding." 

In the same article he addressed 
federal auditors, saying that they 
" have turned the straightforward 
principle of overhead or indirect 
cost recovery on federal grants 
and contracts into a maze of 
procedures that work against the 
very policies they are supposed to 
implement." 

McElroy wanted to make clear 
that there has been " no allegation 
of dishonesty or personal gain on 
the part of research personnel or 
university officials." 

So now " only" the money 
question remains.

"Illegal Alien Threat" Attacked 
.*. * * 

Triton lims "Continued Policy of Narrow-Mindedness" 
Somehow the Triton Times 

always "gets the scoop" 00 the 
latest in archaic thlnJdng. (Maybe 
the management is looking for-
ward to working for the San Diego 
Union.) The latest editorial 
depicting the United States suc-
cumbing to the "disease" of illegal 
aliens demonstrates the continued 
policy of narrow-mindedness for 
which the 'M' is well known. 

As we true-blooded Americans 
carmot be vaccinated against this 
latent strain, the autoor advocates 
stricter regulations and en-
forcement of the type that are 
already making the United States 
such a desirable place ... to be 
incarcerated. 

Lest we forget the benefits of 
illegal labor in the United States, 
we ought to consider the price of 
our freshly picked or processed 
fruits and vegetables. American 
agriculture, in its pursuit of the 
"competitive" market position, 
seeks to hire the cheapest labor 
available. The worker who has no 
legal recourse avoids wage con-
flicts and will often be willing to 
conduct piece work at a rate 

triton times 

considerably less 
minimum wage.

"Fortunately" for us we are able 
to eat more cheaply, but the In-
dividual who made that food 
available to us remains a fugitive, 

This summer I happened to be in 
El Paso at sunrise, overlooking the 
Rio Grande. There was no Border 
Patrol in sight, but there were 
literally scores of people waiting 
for a chance to enter the country 
illegally. One man edged along the 
150 foot railroad bridge that 
towered over the river. Once 
across he dropped to the coocrete 
below and ran as if his life 
depended on it. Maybe he was 
caught. maybe he will be caught 
again. 

Unlike Richard Nixon, I am not 
particularly proud of the per-
centage of world resources that the 
United States consumes. I don't 
think it is justified. There are 
many people on this planet who 
want a -chance at such unlimited 

consumptioo (including many U.S. 
citizens). I penonally think theIr 
values are distorted, but I can 
understa .... why . 

Excluding Native Americans, all 
of us are descended from aliens 
Illegal or otherwise. The Irish 
Docked here, the Chinese were 
brought here, and now many 
Mexicans desire to work here. 
Certainly the influx of iounigrant 
labor keeps some "Americans" out 
of work. That is the way the game 
is played in this country. But In-
stead of changing the rules, wby 
don't we change the game?

Fenton's Ideas Threaten Democracy 
In the Oct. 13 issue of the Triton Times appears a "commentary" 

directed against the so called "illegal alien threat." Tlie article Is signed

The fact of the matter is that the U.S., like the rest of the capitalist 
countries, is going through ooe more of its inevitable crisis of over-
production. Mr. Fenton, however, attempts to blame the "illegal aliens" 
for Ute worsening of the crisis. HIs argwnent shows that either he is not 
infonned at all about the real situation, or makes a deliberate attempt to 
divide the people by obscuring the issue through a series of slanders.

First, Fenton claims that "illegal aliens are taking from all U.S. 
citizens jobs which rightly belong to U.S. citizens." What he does not 
mention is the fact that the jobs "illegal aliens" get are the hardest and 
the lowest paid; jobs that no "legal citizen" would be willing to take for · 
such a pay! 

In June of 1975, for example, the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service arrested 2.154 "ille~al aliens" in the sweat shops of Los Angeles 
leaving, of course, the same amount of job openings. When the state 
employment officials offered unemployed U.S. workers to take such jobs 
at regular wages (we have to remember that "illegal aliens" get paid less 
than other workers ) 99% of them refused to do it. 

Then, Fenton argues that " in addition, they (the " illegal aliens") are 
often using public services which cost everyone tax money, while 
themselves paying little or nothing in taxes." A recent survey conducted 
by the U.S. Department of Labor showed that, from a large number of 
Mexicans arrested in this countrf without papers : 

77% had paid Social Security - . 
73% paid federal income tax through automatic withholding 
less than 4% had children in school ' 
less than 4% collected unemployment 
less than .5% had ever been on welfare. 
The government is obviously getting more than it is giving! These 

simple facts show that Fenton's "commentary" is based on conjecture, 
slander, and blatant lies. 

Fenton also says that "(illegal aliens) are willing to work for a low 
wages, tempting employers to hire them." The truth, however, is that big 
business needs cheap labor to make more profits. This is why they ac-
tually import foreign workers. If this is not the case, we would like to ask 
why is it that the U.S. is exporting factories and " run-away shots" into 
Latin America, Africa, Asia, and other parts of the world where they pay 
ridiculous wages? It is only when there is a crisis of over-production such 
as the one we are suffering right now, that they a re forced to diminish 
pr<fduction, to fire workers, and to look for scapegoats such as the " illegal 
aliens. " 

" Illegal aliens. since they are not U.S. citizens, do not deserve any of 
the rights guaranteed to U.S. citizens by the Constitution." By this, 
Fenton means that the hwnan rights the U.S. Constitution grants to 
everyone should be denied to people--he apparently does not regard as 
human beings! 

Finally, Fenton ends his attack by proposing the support of fascist 
legislation such as the Rodino Bill and a number of "solutions" to the 
" problem" (electrified fences, increased border policing, strong military 
fortifications, etc.) . It is curious to note that both, his argument and his 
proposed " alternatives" coincide totally with the program of the

Even though He only allows

Jones, who's garnered a 
reputation as a musical genius 
over the years for his incredible 
proliferation at composing themes 
for films ("In the Heat of The

sorts and manages to reduce each 
to a common ground of pre-
packaged blandness. The jazz here 
is stiff and disturbingly for-
malistic, predicated on text-book 
improvisation. The funk material, 
which dominates this set, is the 
sort of freeze dried soul mongering 
in which every contemporary 
rhythm and blues shtick finds . 
usage, sans an ingratiating con-
text. Anyone who reduces stellar 
musicians like Stevie Wonder, 
Toots Theilman, Billy Cobham, 
Stanley Clarke, and Ron Carter to 
duties more suited for ditch 
diggers is someone who over-rates 
their talents and is blind to

People are still griping about the 

artistic degeneration of the Stones, 
Led Zeppelin, The Who, and others 
who make up the hierarchy of hard 
rock, maintaining that these 
people have ceased to be in-
teresting entities (by virtue of their

work, which is how any artist 
should be judged) and have in 
effect become jaded jet setters, 
press hungry creeps more in-
terested in who they're seen 
drinking with ("Look, here's a shot 
of Bowie lapping Wild Turkey with

crafted most of their songs are on 
each new release. The audience 
that loves creative raunch and roll 
feels itself betrayed. The central 
question is where are the next hard 
rock heroes coming from? And, on 
a more despairing level, is hard 
rock a dead form, and is the old 
elites ' ascendance into their 
thirties an indication that their 
fans should grow up as well and 
stop acting like eighteen year old 
punks? An integral part of rock 
and roll 's invisible aesthetic is that 
no one, performer or fan, grows 
old. If a performer is forced by 
creaking bones to modify his style, 
and if a fan views this as a 
despicable delve into the com-
mercialism of middle of the road

new heroes. Aerosmith and

hands who get sidetracked into a 
dance of bad ha bits ), Street· 
walkers stance has roots in lower 
middle class English life, the sort 
of middle-brow street toughness 

The Stones have postured in for 
years. Unlike The Stones, though, 
Streetwalker's music is tougher, 
harder edged, with better song 
writing intelligence. At best, as 
evident on the band's new release 

Red Card, the sonj;(S employ nerve 
shattering dissonance, off centered 
rhythms, and thick guitar chord 
coloration, which enhance the 
lyrics' undercurrent themes of 
frustration, tension, and dead-end 
kid violence. Vocalist Roger 
Chapman is the last word in rock 

screamers. His voice is a cross 
between a scream and banshee 
wail, frantic and frayed, achieving 
such intensity that the effect is 
frightening. Guitarist Charlie 
Whitney, though not as virtuostic 
as Aerosmith's Perry, applies 

himself tastefully here. He uses 
deft. chord constructions to bolster 
moods, uses terse blues phrases 
for what few breaks he allows 
himself, and demonstrates an 
ability with the catchy riff that 
maintains that skill's status as a 
minor league art. 

If you're still hankering for the 
invigorating throb of heavy metal, 
these two. releases will satiate your 
want. If it's not quite your slice of 
life, go back to your Harry Chapin 
records. Both rated A plus.

• Ai • Nonviolent? byhalWa." 
. S1aff'Reperter 

AIkido, one of newest martial arts, appears tQ be a paradox. The 
better one gets ~tE1do, the less one wants to fight. In fact, among 
Aikido students, In re is no figliing to see who wins, not even matches 
just training and ractice. Perhaps this is the attitude -that attracb 

~le like Bob Bu on, a representative of the UC San Diego on-campus 
AIkido club, to study and perfonn the art of AIkido. 

"Listen to me ('r anyone talk about Aikido and you're bound to hear 
some of the philosophical cliches conunon to the martial arts these 
days," says Button. "But, the benefits which Aikido can offer, including 
self-defense, come from attentive training not from faithful wishing." In 
other words, correct knowledge and use of one's own mind and body 
requires a lot more doing than talking. This makes rigorous training e~n though it may never be used in actual fighting, an important part of 
Aikido. ' 

The Aikido club was formed especially for this purpose. By joining the 
club, which meets in the gym on every Monday evening from 8:00-9:30 
and Saturday morning from 11:00-12:30, Button and other members like 
him, are able to get extra training and practice in the art of Aikido. 

B,u~n admits that ~e club and Aikido have been very important force in 
!Us life for the last sIX yecu:s. " I have studied Aikido for six years now and 
It has made a tremendous unpact on my life ." Button has also spent some 
time in Japan studying Aikido. 

" There are several schools of Aikido," said Button." The style which I 
study is Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido which literally translates as ' the way to 
unify mind and body.' " Button said that regardless of style the instructor 
makes the difference, and UCSD currently has an excellent instructor. 

Button stated that the Aikido club was not only for training purposes, 
but also was used as a focus of social gatherings as well. "We have many 
things like potlucks and parties that all members can attend." 

Anything that is cormected to Aikido, directly or indirectly, is also 
connected to the club. This quarter,meditation seminars are planned and 
frequently, other special seminars are presented as well. The Revelle 
Cluster Library will soon contain eln Aikido section that is sponsored by 
the club. 

Button also invites anyone who is even remoteiy interested in Aikido to 
come to a meeting. "Even though most persons won't get a thorough 

comp~ehensio~ of Aikido just from coming to our club, they can get a 
good mtroduction ... and most of the people who come to a meeting find it 
interesting. "

Coop Selects Support Group 
Coordinators for New Year 

GAO Finds FBI Wasting Time 
by Dorothy Hllllitoo

their Support Group coor-
dinatorships for the coming year. 

-Susan Karpinski gained the

Rape ... 
views the woman as a "plaything-
enjoyed then <tiscarded as a 
squeezed lemon." In her opinion, 
the acceptance of the woman as an 
equal partner will be a long time 
coming. 

Having been.,. victim, Del Drago 
points out that "It's a shock that 
doesn't ever wear df." Reporting 
the crime can be a serious matter, 
especially in a Chicano family 
where a woman will still often be 
disowned if family members learn 
that she has been raped. 

With Task Force assistance, 
women are not forced to reveal 
their identity and the case does not 
have to be brought to court. 
However, with increasing open-
ness in dealing with the problem, 
U1ere are hopes that more rapists 
will be prosecuted. 

Dou't Take Chances 
Del Drago outlined certain 

precautionary measures that may 
be taken by women to lessen the 
chances of an attack : 

• Avoid walking alone or in dimly 
lit areas. 

'If you are approached, scream 
or break away. 

'If your attacker is armed, don't 
resist. 

*Avoid hitch-hiking or accepting 
rides from strangers.

see if it is truly living up to its 
" renaissance man "label. 

"Any dynamic college or 
university has to constantly review 
its own goals," said Tapp. She 
admitted that the Revelle 
curriculum is very structured, but 
noted that if structured properly, 
" it should allow for excellence in 
the social sciences, hwnanities, 
and hard sciences. One just doesn't 
live in a science world," she said. 

Tapp hopes to be an accessible 
provost, and is presently exploring 
ways to rnake her more "open" to 
the Revelle campus. Within the 
next few weeks a "provost's table" 
is scheduled to be set .uP in the 
Revelle cafeteria to 'allow her 
conversation with both students, 
staff, and faculty. 

Tapp questioned the idea of 
whether she was a "model" for 
other women to aspire to, stating 
that "I've been a woman for. long 
time, long before this job." 
However, sbe did say that 
"anybody who assumes the role d

Under the board's Code of 

Procedure, it would announce to 
the general campus the time and 
place of a hearing to determine if 
the Chancellor has actually 

violated the provisions of the 
Election Code. The Chancellor 
would be then given an opportunity 
at such a hearing to respond to the 
allegations against him. 

Edwards of California, who 
requested the study, maintains 
that " there is something wrong 
with a police agency that wastes its 
time on 91 out of 100 cases." 
Edwards further claims that the 
FBI is " fooling themselves and 
fooling the people." 

The board would then release a 
"Finding of Fact" to the public, 
which would include its decision

any). McElroy could appeal the
