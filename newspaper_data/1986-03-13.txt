Scripps explores 
Pacific Basin 

An oceanographic research 
expedition conducted by UCSD's 
Scri pps Institution of 
Oceanography, for the first rime 
in the Western Pacific Ocean, 
has recovered metal-rich, 
geological materials associated 
with deep-sea volcanic activiry. 

Dr. James W. Hawkins, a 
professor of geology at Scripps 
Instirution led the month-long 
expedition on Scripp's research 
vessel Thomas Washington in an 
area known as the Lau Basin 
bewrween the Tonga and Fiji 
islands, north of New Zealand. 

Very young ocean-floor 
materials, including, black-glass 
basalts and metaUiferous sulfides, 
were dredged from a dept of 
about 7,000 feet. Some materials 
are believed to be only a few 
decades old. 

Some four tons of rocks and 
other sea floor materials, 
collected during 36 dredges, 
were brought back to Scripps 
Institution , Professor Hawkins 
said. 

In addition to dredging, the 
at-sea work included extensive 
mapping of the sea floor in the 
region by a sophisticated sonar 
device called Sea Beam. Professor 
Hawkins said future investigation 
may include manned-submersible 
exploration of the Lau Basin's 
vent field .

Regents approval needed 

Student input shapes 
new university center 
By ELLEN CAPRIO, Scaff Wricer 

STUDENTS HAVE been the dominant force in the planning, of th.e new University Center, an $18.5 million project awaiting design approval by UC Regents later this month , 
accordi ng to Tommy Tucker, chair of the University Center 

Programming Building Advisory Committee (UCPBAC). 
The University Center is designed to be the "living room" or 

"hearthstone" of the campus, providing services to assist "members 
of the college family ... in their daily lives on the campus for gening 
to know and understand one another through informal association 
outside the classroom," according to the committee's working 
definition of the complex. 

Designs for the University Center include a multi-purpose hall 
with adjacent kitchen, a movie theatre serving as a classroom 
during the day, student meeting rooms, lounges and organizations, 
a.computer room, box office, restaurants with indoor and outdoor 
eating areas, game rooms, a darkroom , offices, and a new three-
level bookstore. 

"Students will speCify what kind of restaurants they want and 
the committee will be accepting proposals. They're looking for 
those restaurants of the best quality, price and experience," 
Tucker said. Italian. Chinese, and Mexican foods, plus a 
delicatessan and pub are being considered, he added. 

Funding for the new University Center comes from five major 
sources: Registration Fee Reserves ($1 million), Campus 
(Chancellor) Discretionary Funds ($1 million), 25th Anniversary 
Fund-RaiSing Campaign ($2 miUion), Revenue (student fee 
increase) Bonds ($9.15 million) and the Booksrore ($5.5 million). 

Students voted in May 1984 to help fund the University Center 
by accepting a $25 per quarter increase in fees . The increase, 
beginning after groundbreaking in the fall, Will account for $9.15 
million of the total revenue. 

The . site, selected from recommendations made by an 
architectural firm in Newport Beach at an open meeting last year, 
will be south of the Central Library, on the northern edge of the 
Chancellor's lot, Tucker said . 

'The University Center wiD come righr up to the Chancellor's 
door, but he isn't going to move," Ann Nalevanko in the Resource 
Management office said. 

The registrar and surrounding offices, displaced by the 
University Center, will move to Warren campus. where the 
accounting department is currently located. Accounting, which 
handles financial aid , payrolls, payments to vendors, research 
funds, and general accounting, will move to Sorrento Valley. 

The move is not expected to affect student services, Frank Cvar, 
assistant vice chancellor of financial affairs said . 

The move "will have Iinle or no effect on students in reality," Cvar 
said. 

The site was chosen in compliance with the long range 
development plan ofUGSD, which pictures Central Library as the 
center of campus. 

'The great thing about that (the recommendation) is that Central

Cheating 
Continued from page 1 

Recently, the deans of the four 
colleges at UCSD brought the 
fact of increased reports of 
cheating to the attention of the 
faculty , by authoring and 
distributing a memo that 
encourages the faculty to ad here 
to the university's longstanding 
policy of academic dishonesty 
and to take preventative 
measures to deter cheating in 
their own lecture halls. 

Muir College Dean Chip 
Dreilinger said that the memo 
was sent in order to "explain (to 
the faculty) how to work UCSD's 
current policy." 

Dreilinger described the 
current poliCies regarding 
cheating as "middle of the road 
compared to other institutions ." 
Dreili nger pr~dicted that each 
college dean is aware of 20 to )0 
cases of academic dishonesty 
each year. . 

According to the "UCSD Poltcy 
on Integrity of Scholarship ," 
included in the General Catalog, 
there are twO types of penalties 
placed on the cheating offender; 
one is academic and the other 
administrative. 

"The customary academic 
penalty for a serious brea~h of 
academic honesty results In 
failure in the course, although 
lesser penalties may be incurred 
in less serious circumstances," 
the policy states. . 

The administrative penalty IS 
placed on the offender by the 
student's college dean and that 
penalty may be "Probation for 
the first offense, and dismissal 
with a permanent record (of 
academic dishonesty) for the 

second offense ," according to the 
policy. 

Students are learning to cheat 
bener and with more frequency." 
Dreilinger said . "The majority of 
the cheating is done because the 
student is worried about what 
parents will think of a low grade, 
or fear that they are hurting their 
chances of getting into their 
maJor. Surprisingly, more 
cheating is done to raise a B 
grade to an A grade than an F to 
a passing grade." 

Warren College Dean Harriet 
Marsh said that Warren College 
alone has ten to fifteen 
disciplinary cases found guilty 
each year, and that the students 
convicted are mainly freshmen 
and sophomores in large lower 
division classes. 

The majority of the staff, 
faculty and students questioned 
speci fied that the engineering 
and computer science courses 
had the highest amount of 
cheating of all the departments. 

Larry Milstein , chairman of the 
EECS department, agrees with 
the severity of thejroblem in 
these sciences, an remarked 
that cheating is most prevalent 
in cases where the students 
jointly do programs, lab reports 
and take home exams. 

Daniel Olfe, depanment chair 
of the AMES department, said 
that the increase in cases of 
academic dishonesty in the 
engineering and computer 
sciences is due to the B average 
that students are expected to 
maintain in order to gain entry 
into their majors. 

Olfe also said that "if 10% of 
the students in these courses 
were cheating that would be an 
awful lot. If it were any higher 
than that, then the profesor 
would almost have to be

encouraging it (cheating)." 
A professor who wished to 

remain anonymous commented 
that "these policies are not 
utilized consistently by the 
faculty because the process of 
prosecuting IS very time 
consuming ... (therefore) some 
professors choose to ignore it 
(cheating). " 

The UCSD Policy on Integrity · 
of Scholarship states the ideals 
that each person a~soclated with 
UCSD should uphold: "The 
principle of honesty must be 
upheld if the integrity ~f . 
scholarship is to be mamtamed 
by an academic community. The 
university expects that both the 
faculty and students will honor 
this principle and in so doing 
protect the validity of university 
grading. This means that all 
academic work will be done by 
the student to whom it is 
assigned, without unauthorized 
aid of any kind . Instructors, for 
their pan, will exercise care 
explaining and supervising 
academic work, so the honest 
effort will be encouraged ." 

Of the forty students polled in 
a recent random survey, more 
than 40% agreed that the current 
increase in cheating is due to 
the overall "immoral and 
competitive attitude of this 
institution and the entire 
country," as one student phrased 
it. )0% said the amount of 
cheating is due to a specific 
person's morals, and 20% state<;l 
that it is the fault of the UC 
system and the apathy of its 
professors. 

Other conclusions of the poll 
showed that the majority of the 
students cheated on several 
occasions during high school.

Wooing the world with education 
Theoretically, this university is an institution into which we have all 

entered freely. Nevenheless, it seems that every day we wonder why we 
subject ourselves to the judgments of academics here. At one time or 
another, we are all faced with the problem of discern ing how much 
authority we will let these teachers have in our lives. 

only lamely begun to meet the expectations of our teachers. 
Education should be the means we use to become most fully human, 

yet each one of us b~comes l~ss human because we strive only to 
co~pete and to survive. Gradmg scales produce a feeling of hierarchy 
which forces us as students to subvert one another. We ignore the real 
SOCiety in which we must work and create, and we degrade the 
potential of collective effort. 

We come here for many reasons, but few of us can claim that we 
study under this university simply because we want to learn what it 
means to be human. Most of us have been influenced by our parents 
and peers and media to believe that we must attend the university. We 
expect that the university is the place where we finally establish our 
independence. We begin to focus our time on how we will overcome 
the exam questions with which the university presents us. Above all , we 
want to be able to succeed in this environment in order to obtain 
financial and social benefits once we finish our schooling. 

Education should be a way for us to question who we are and what 
we believe. It should be the focus of our curiosity and creative energies. 

In order to become truly human, we must question ourselves. We 
must learn the power of introspection. We must learn how to judge our 
own works and the w.orks of others. Instead of merely regurgitating what 
our professors tell us IS correct, we must learn to judge for ourselves 
what the meaning and intention of our work is. 

"V':'e have accepted the university as an extension .of the problems of 
society as a whole. We expect and allow our educanon to be a process 
by and through which we are punished and weeded. This school has 
become an elusive third parent of sorts. It dictates standards which we 
try to fill ; we are never quite sure whether or not we have worked hard 
enough or done what we should have done. We try to woo our teachers 
with our intellectual prowess, and we continue to base our effons on the 
standards that have been doled out from the academics. We have not 
yet learned how to live with ourselves and with one another;we have 

We must question why we want education. What do we intend to 
gain through our education? We must put together the reasons we have 
attempted to "educate" ourselves and we must make sure that those 
reasons are both for the common good and for the individual good. 

Education should be the means by which we discover who and how it 
is best to be. We should uncover difficult moral and political questions. 
We must learn to express what is best about being human, what is best 
about thinking and feeling. We should be educated in how to live with 
not against, ourselves. ' 

The ills of the Mghani resistance 
By GLENN SACKS 

ON DECEMBER 27, 1979 the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. The 
American people reacted with 
shock and dismay as pictures of 
Afghans with rifles going up 
against Russian tanks flashed 
across our TV screen. But who 
are the Afghan rebels? Who are 
these men who President Reagan 
calls "freedom fighters?" Well , a 
closer look reveals some 
unexpected surprises. 

The Afghan "freedom fighters" 
are Khomein ist Islamic 
fundamentalists whose 
antagonism towards the Soviet-
backed regime stems directly 
from their opposition to the 
leftist regime's progressive 
reforms. Indeed, the action that 
triggered the rebellion was the 
Afghan communists' granting of 
equal rights to women. 

The resistahce movement 
consists primarily of 
reactionaries doing the bidding 
of religious leaders and rich 
landowners. The movement is no 
more interested in creating a just 
and democratic SOciety than the 
ideological inspiration the 
Ayatollah Khomeini has shown 
himsell to be in Iran. The real 
progressive force in Afghanistan 
is represented not by the 
fu ndamentalist rebels but by the 
Soviet-backed Afghan 
communists. A look at history 
demonstrates this clearly. 

Until the 1978 leftist coup , 
Afghanistan slept in the lOth 
century. As in all Muslim 
societies, particularly in 
fundamentalist Afghanistan, 
women suffered intolerable 
oppressIOn. Women were the 
legal p roperty of their husbands 
and were non-persons in the 
eyes of the law. They were not 
permined to own or inherit 
property, to be educated or to 
hold office. The literacy rate for 
Afghan women was 1 percent, 
the world's lowest. Because they 
were forced to wear huge and 
oppressive veils which covered 
their entire bodies and 
prevented them from intaking 
clean air. the rate of tuberculosis 
for Afghan women was among 
the highest in the world . 

Polygamy was common, and 
women served out their lives as 
the silent servants of their legal 
owners, their husbands. 

In 1978, the Afghan Daud 
regime tried to suppress the pro-
Soviet People's Democratic Party 
of Afghanistan. but instead, the 
Daud regime was overthrown by 
the PDPA The PDPA moved 
quickly to implement its leftist 
program. The regime pushed the 
country ahead 500 years by 
decreeing the separation of 
church and state . It implemented 
a progressive land reform which 
gave each family a chance to 
break out of desperate poverty b} 
farmi ng their own land . Women 
were made equal citizens under 
the law, and they were given an 
unprecedented chance to learn 
to read , to own and inherit 
property, to choose their 
marriage partners, to go to 
school , to obtain divorce and to 
file legal action against their 
husbands for physical abuse . 

Despite certain repressive 
tactics, the regime's reforms laid 
the basis for a new Afghanistan, 
one in whic h all citizPD$ had 
equal rights, tl-; !, g;Jvemment 
acted indeperdently of religious 
in fluences an j every citizen had 
a chance to dchieve a decent 
standard of living. 

Nevertheless, these liberating 
reforms threate ned existing 
privileges and encountered great 
opposition within the more 
reactionary sectors of Afghan 
SOCiety. According to the NY 
Times , "Land reform attempts 
undermined village chiefs and 
secular government undermined 
religious leaders, but it was the 
Kabul revolutionary government's 
granting of new rights to women 
which pushed Muslim men into 
picking up th eir guns," 

The reactionary rebels made 
significant gains against the 
PDPA. and the leftist regime 
requested Soviet military 
interve ntion . Faced with th e 
prospect of a fanatically anti-
communist, Iran-like government 
on their border. the Soviet Union 
invaded Afghanistan, 

In the West, [he intervention 
was greeted with angry charges 

that the U.s.s.R. had violated 
Afghan national self-
determination , but there are 
several faCts which contradict 
this interpretation. For one 
thing, Afghanistan was in no way 
a nation as we know it. Instead, 
it was a collection of tribes and 
tribal territories. Imer-tribal 
hatred and rivalries ran deep. 
The different tribes spent a good 
deal of their time not fighting 
the Russians but fight ing each 
other. 

Should the Russians pull out of 
Afghanistan, the inter-tribal 
bloodbath will break out in full 
force. Even now, "Tribal leaders 
are storing American a rms for 
what they call 'the second war: 
the inter-tribal power struggle 
which will break OUt if the 
Russians leave." Give n the 
example of the six Muslim 
provinces of the Soviet Union 
each individual tribe will have 
far more self-determination 
under the leftist regi me than they 
would if one tribe wins the post-
Soviet civil war and imposes its 
rule upon all others. Indeed , the 
c ry of self-dete rmination 
becomes completel" meaningless 
when we cons ider .hat what is 
meant by "self-dete rmination" in 
this case is only the protection 
and continuation of rule by a 
parasitic and brutal elite and not 
the realization of the aspirations 
of the Afghan people . some of 
whom support the communists. 

The Russians are nm as 
heavily involved milita rily as our 
politicians would lead us to 
believe . An a rticle by New York 
Times military analyst Drew 
Middleton entitled "No Viemam 
for Moscow" reveals some 
startling evid ence to the contrary. 
"W estern analysts agree that only 
about 12,000 to 15,000 Soviet 
troops are fighting the Afghan 
resistance (of the roughly 
).10 ,000 soldiers stationed in the 
country) and that only 500 to 
700 are involved in daily 
operations," the Times tells us. 
"This minimal use of Soviet 
military power can be attributed 
to the effectiveness of 
airpower ... and to the 
willingness of the reconstituted 

Afghan army to carry out ground 
operatiOns against the 
insurgents." The article goes on 
to say that the Afghan 
communist anny, while suffering 
from early casualties and 
defections , has been 
strength ened and re-stiffened 
and that key communist 
offensives "have not met the 
bitter resistance that insurgent 
statements would lead analysts to 
exoect." 

The Afghan conflict has been 
a war of terror on both sides. 
The Soviets have used large 
amounts of airpower against 
rebel areas of support and 
thousands of civilians have been 
killed in the process. In six years 
of fight ing, the rebels and the 
civilian population have suffered 
between 100 ,000 and 200,000 
deaths. 

The rebel tactics are equally 
brutal. When they're not killing 
each other, the rebels regularly 
lauch terrori st attacks against 
civilian targets such as theaters, 
bars, buses and airports. The 
resistance shot down a civilian 
airliner six months ago and have 
to date destroyed 1,800 schools 
and over 200 medical facilities. 
Nearly a thousand schoolteachers 
have been killed, some of them 
skinned alive, for the "crime" of 
teaching young girls to read. The 
Washington Post magazine claims 
that th ere are "seventy Russian 
prisoners living lives of 
indescribable horror," and that 
eve n Congress has questioned 
the Afghan rebels' human rights 
record. 

Upon victory, Afghanistan will 
be absorbed into the Soviet 
sphere of influence. A look at 
Muslim Soviet Central Asia gives 

a good picture of what a pos t-
war, post-reconstruction 
Afghanistan will look like. Less 
than 60 years ago these Muslim 
provinces were as backward as 
Afghanistan is today, yet in 
Soviet Central Asia, the literacy 
rate is 99 percent, infant 
mortality a mere 3.3 percent and 
life expectancy in 67 years. The 
standard of living is the highest 
in all the Muslim world ; indeed, 
it is higher than in most parts of 
ht U.S.S.R. Women have made 
tremendous gains; there is a 
higher percentage of women 
judges and members of 
parliament in Muslim U.S.S.R. 
than there are in the United 
States. While Soviet Muslims 
mu st endure the same lack of 
political freedom that all Soviet 
peoples do, their lives have been 
greatly improved since 
communist rule was established 
in the 1920s. 

By contrast, an Afghan rebel 
government, after the initial and 
extensive inter-tribal civil war 
and bloodbath , would be 
characteri zed by a lack of 
personal and political freedom, 
state-instituted Muslim 
fanaticism, lack of autonomy for 
all tribes except the vic tor in the 
inter-tribal civil war, non-
personhood and denial of all 
rights fo r women and feudal 
economic oppression for all. 

The advantages of the lefti st 
regime are numerous. Despite all 
of the rhetroric of our politicians, 
the fact remains that the 
communists are the lesser of two 
evils in Afghanistan. A Soviet 
regime is in many ways 
undeSirable, a Muslim resistance 
regi me would be far, far worse.

Money talks 
Ed itor: 

In the real world , outside of 
the protective world of UCSD. 
citi zens have the right to choose 
which media they want to 
purchase. This same system of 
letting the market demands 
determine the supply can be 
utilized to fund our media. To 
illustrate my pOint, I will give an 
example. Say $1.00 from each 
student'S fees are set aside for 
media. By simply allowing each 
student to allocate speci fie 
percentages LO each of the 

media, fu nding levels would be 
established , If a student does not 
wish to support a paper, whether 
it is based on a disinte rest or a 
dissatisfaction, that individual 
can reflect his opinion with a 
vote . If a media source receives 
below a cenain level , possibly 3 
percent, the n that media mUSl 
find anoth er source of funds If 
they wish to continue to be 
published. 

The results of my proposal 
would be a more effective way to 
make altemative media 
responsible and accountable to 

the public. Issue s such as th e 
wasteful dumping of papers 
which end up blowing down the 
sidewalk. highly infrequent 
publications and off-campus 
distribution would be questioned. 
In actua lity, I believe that this 
proposal would gvie the media a 
high level of freedom to 
dete rmi ne their own destiny. An 
outside source has every right to 
fi nancially support a paper 
whic h is nOt funded by the 
students. At the same time, the 
students have the right to spend 
their money the way they deem 

appropriate 
As an addi tion to my proposal , 

I would include a system for 
introducing new types of media 
to the student . A simple 
requirement of student Signatures 
on a petition could be used , 
making that new media eligible 
for seed money and an adviser 
for one year. The publication 
would then be added to the 
normal voting procedure . with 
the same 3 percent limit having 
to be met afte r their first trial 
period .

Creating and constructing at 
the Crafts Center 
By DAWN WAITS SraffWrirer 
"E VER COME by? Ever 

looked in the window? 
Ever taken a class? 

Ever been in the building? Ever 
cared about the place?" asks Ron 
Carlson , director of the Crafts 
Center. Dressed in a plaid shllt, 
grey jeans, and sandals with 
socks, Ron talks about the Crafts 
Center and his experiences 
there . 

were the rtrst two disciplines 
taught, whIle jewelry, stained 
glass and others were added 
later. Ron explains that since 
interest is not sustained at the 
same level through history for 
the various crafts, cenain classes 
are added or dropped , 
depending on enrollment. 

Since Ron took over the 
directorship in 1977, he has 
began to increase the amount of 
programs. At one time the Crafts 
Center was offering 40 programs 
in one quarter. Ron says that, 
"tt's kind of an uphill battle since 
the place is pretty small." 

In the past, classes have been 
held aU over campus, in 
basements and classrooms. "I've 
found out through running this 
place," Ron explains "that you 

build the place ourselves for 
about a tenth of the cost." The 
purpose of the gaDery is twofold . 
First, it is a place to showcase 
work made in the Crafts Center. 
Secondly, it is another resource 
for income. 

Despite the biannual crafts 
sale, income for the center is 
limi ted . In addition, the funding 
sources have never been 
excessive or predictable for the 
Crafts Center," according to Ron. 
"T he future has never been too 
sure for the Crafts Cemer until

refers to that time as the "Golden 
Age of crafts." There was a great 
amount of student mterest m

during the '60s and '70s. "That's 
why this place got off the 
ground , because of the 
tremendous interest from 
students," explains Ron. 

are much better off offering fewer 
programs with much greater 
depth and the best possible 
instruction and facilities you can 
get."

the past few years," Ron adds. It 
seems class enrollment plays the 
biggest role in the Crafts Center's 
future . "There's a tremendous 
drop in enrollment when you 
raise the fees ," explains Ron. 

The Crafts Center has, in the 
past, tried different types of 
programs to attract students to 
enroll. They've tried everything 
from cooking classes to car 
maintenance classes. Also, if 
there are not ad vanced classes 
offered in a panicular craft, 
students will often get frustrated 
because they cannO! continue . 

Studio memberships are 
available for those people who 
want to work in photography or 
ceramics. You pay a base fee and 
have 24 hour access to the 
tudio . The cost is the same as a 

beginning class, or some people 
volunteer in the gaUery in 
exchange for studio membership. 

"The thing that's nice about 
the studio is that you can get as 
involved as you want," says Ron , 
"There's just so few places on 
campus where students, faculty, 
and staff can work together in a 
cooperative kind of way." 

With 22 hourly instructors and 
one other full-time employee 
working at the Crafts Center, 
Ron says that "there isn't enough 
time and staff to do what we 
would like to do ... as far as 
outreach, recruitment, and 
gening more involved ." However, 
the Crafts Center got together 
with the Japanese studies 
depanment last year and co-
sponsored a J apanes~ tea 
demonstration , at the UCSD 

Open House. 
The limit to the number of 

activities and programs offered 
by the Crafts Center is reflective 
of the number of students who 
sign up for the classes. "That's 
where the off-campus community 
people play an important role." 
Ron believes. When these people 
pay up to three times as much to 
enroll , it not only supports the 
Crafts Center. but gives the 
classes enough students to keep 
class going. 

In 1985 the Crafts Center 
added a classroom onto the 
building. This was built in 
conjucture with the Chancellor's 
Development Fund . "We're now 
using the classroom in the 
evenings and on the weekends 
for classes and workshops ," Ron 
explains. Other academic 
programs, such as English as a 
second language , are taught in 
the classroom during the day. 

With the exception of a 
couple of classes held in the 
student's center. the Crafts 

Cemer is now able to teach most 
of its classes in the building, 
Instead of holding them in 
various locations on campus, 
which was the situation in the 
past. 

"We still need more room, but 
we're getting there slowly," Ron 
comments. 

The store plays an integral 
part in the center. "It plays and 
ever-increasing role in the entire 
operation of the place." explains 
Ron . He adds, "Since Maryann 
has been here, there has been a 
significam upgrading in the 
appearance and organization , 
and quality of things for sale." 
Maryann CaDery was hired in 
1984 as the store manager and 
co-director of the gaUerv. 
Together, Ron and Maryann 
attempt to run the store in a way 
that will benelit the gallery in 
funding. However, Ron says the 
gallery is "a burden to us because 
of the high COSt." 

All the expenses for the gaDery 
are taken from the store's 

Til um/ay, March 13, 1986 7 
FEATURES 

inco me. Nevertheless, Ron says 
he wouldn't consider closing the 
gallery because of the high cost 
of running it. "Everyone wants 
them (galleries), they JUSt don 't 
want to have to pay for them. 
Arts are always the first to go 
and the last to get funded." 

Ron puts in long hours at the 
Crafts Center everyday except for 
Tuesdays and Fridays when he 
leaves early to play raquetbaU. 
Despite this busy schedule Ron 
says he is "finaUy doing some an 
after a couple of years ." He is 
committed to four shows this 
year with his ceramics. There 
will be an upcoming show at the 
Grove GaDery in October which 
Ron and a painter is involved in. 

Ron speaks enthusiastically 
about the workshops that are 
continuoulsy going on at the 
Crafts Center. "We have the best 
faculty in San Diego teaching the 
classes: he says. Within the next 
two years , Ron hopes to develop 
two new programs in glass 
blowing and art with neon. ~

Divisional Dilemmas: Part II 

Sporting a low budget 
By JOHN SCHACHT, GUS SANTOYO, MA IT LAlT 

T HIS IS THE second part of a two part seric on the problems of the Division 
111 intercollegiate athletics at 
UCSD. Presented in this article 
are facts and quotes concerning 
the state of UCSD's poor 
attendance, recruiting difficulties, 
eqUipment shortages and the 
lack of adequate equipment 
facilities and finally the 
progmm's financial obstacles. 
Item: Attendance at sporting events 
IS less than supporrive oj UCSD's 
Irtrercollegtace athletics. 
. "Because we have no football 
team, gate receipts are minimal 
at best." -Reg Fee Report. 
. The baseball team plays its 
home games on campus at Olsen 
field . It is rare that more than 
ten students ever show up for 
home games. A recent Guardian 
survey asked the question; "00 
you know where Olsen Field is? 
Of the 50 students polJed only 
three said that they knew where 
it was and two of the three had 
never been to a game there. 

UCSD men's basketball coach 
Tom Marshall. on attendance: 
. ''I've tried every gimmick I know 
to get people out to the games, 
but they just don't show." 
. "Because UCSD is Division llI , 
it does not receive the nOLOnety 
that schools such as San Diego 
State and other 'big time' 
athletics enjoy." -Reg fee 
Repon. 
. "A stronger sports progmm at 
UCSD could help fill the gap that 
many (students) feel exists in 
campus life." - Reg Fee Report. 
. A new SPOrtS arena is planned 
to be built on campus in the 
next several years which will 
hold between 5,000 and 7,500. 
However, when Judy Sweet was 
asked if UCSD's Division III 
teams could ever bring in the 
attendance to fiJI such an arena 
she said, "That would be a 

d ream, obviously. Realistically, I 
don 't think a Division 1II team 
could ever hope to fill it."

Item: The Division 111 philosophy is 
that student athletes will not receive 
any scholarship or an)' benefits not 
afforded to the regular student. 
. -1 think it's (Division III 
scholarship philosophy) a IWO-
sided thing. I like it because the 
kids I have really want to be here 
and 1 kind of like being the 
underdog against the 
'professional' (Division I) 
programs. On the other hand 
recruiting kids that are tens on a 
scale of one to ten is unlikely. If 
we had scholarships I could get 
three or four kids that are tens." 
-Denny Harper. UCSD's men's 
water polo coach. 
. "Our size doesn 't make a 
difference because it (Division III 
athletics) comes down to 
recruiting." -Athletic Director 
judy Sweet. 
. Basketban player, Clayton 
Williams, heavily recruited by 
Marshall, intended on playing at 
UCSD but finally decided to 
accept a NAIA scholarship at 
Point Lorna Nazarene. "I hke 
coach Marshall ... but I JUSt 
didn't want to play at the 
Division III level. I'm used to 
play at a higher level." 
. "it's a little misleading. When 
you pick up our catalog you read 
that we are the most sports-
oriented campus in the country. 
So a kid comes here trom om 
a good rowing progmm like 
Berkeley High, only to 
find out that UCSD 
doesn't have the equipment 
that his own high 
school had." -Assistant crew 
coach Erik Saltmarsh. 
. "1 came from a Division I 
program at SDSU and I've grown 
to like it here at Division III. 
Scholarships woukl make my job 
tougher. It would mean more 
pressure ." -Uz LaPlante, 
women's tennis coach, 1985 
national champions Division III. 
. "It's hard to produce a winning 
program. I can 't offer the things 
a DiviSIOn I team has to offer.

judy Malone, women's basketball 
coach. 
Item: Lack of Junds has led to 
severe shorrages in facilities, travel 
bu~ets, and basic equipment. 
. Travel Expenses: "Since teams 
at UCSD are only allocated for 
one out-of-town trip (overnight 
to Los Angeles), they must either 
compete against those who are 
willing to travel to San Diego or 
agal nst local Division I or II 
schools." -Registration fee

. Per diem (low travel budgets): 
Per diem given to an athlete on 
the road is $8 ($2 for breakfast, 
$2 for lunch, $4 for dinner). -
Reg fee Report . 
. "00 you expect a guy like Dabo 
(Mike Dabasinskas, 613 H , 200

breakfast. Come on!!" -Tom 
Marshall, UCSD men's basketball 
coach. 
. "Swim team does all 
landscaping at Canyonview 
AquatiC Center in order to fund 
out-of-state trips and also to 
compete against schools that are 
on par with UCSD's team ." -
Bert Kobayashi , future chairman 
of physical education 
department. 
. "The major problem associated 
with the departmental programs at 
present is a deficiency of . . . 
recreation and athletic facllines . 
This has resulted in crowded 
conditions, overuse, scheduling of 
activities until 1 am, competition 
for space among athletic teams 
whic h rotate limited gym lII?e for 
both competition and practice, 
and the use of some facilities 
which are inadequate either in 
dimension or in physical 
condition ." -UCSD Sports and 
Rer reation Master Plan. 

. About three-quarters of the 
basketball players said the rec 
gym (often called the "wreck 
your knees gym") was dangerous 
because of its inferior playmg 
surface which has caused 
numerous injuries. 
. UCSD's track team only holds 
two home meets because the 
tmck is "nOt suitable for 
competition and further impairs 
the safety of the athletes due to 
its poor surface ." -UCSD SpOrtS 
and Recreation Master Plan. 
. Chancellor Richard Atkinson 
approves $100,000 emergen~y 
allocation to renovate UCSD s 
soccer field to improve UCSD's 
chances of hosting regionals. 
. Three intercollegiate tearns bid 
for four hour time slOts in the 
gymnasium. Add Marshall: 
"Where most teams practice 
three hours we practice two."

SDSU slips by UCSD; 
season finale Saturday 
By TOM FERGUSON, Staff Writer 

T UESDAY NIGHT at the Triton Pavilion, the UCSD men's volleyball team faced 
powerhouse 10th-ranked San 
Diego State University in a 
rematch of a match played 
earlier in the season. in which 
the Tritons lost in three straight 
games. The tide didn't exactly 
tum for UCSD, however, as they 
again lost three straight LO the 
Aztecs ; but, they certainly gave 
the croSS-town rivals a run for 
their money 11-15, 14-16, 14-16. 

In the first game, scoring 
began slowly as bOth teams 
remained deadlocked at 2-2. 
then SDSU took a quick 6-3 
lead which the Tritons countered 
to tie it up at six. 1 he Aztecs 
again rallied strongly to lead 11-
6 where the score remained for n~merous changes of possession 
before UCSD closed to 10-11. 
However, SDSU's hitti':lg and 
blocking was veryu powerful at the 
end , losing 11-15. 

The Tritons seemed to be 
stronger and more determined in 
the following game, which 
featured some vel)' hard hitting 
on their pan. SDSU had their 
hands full at first, as UCSD 
quickly took a 3-0 lead and 
advanced it to 8-4 on strong 
hitting and net violations . 
committed by the Aztecs. Despite 
this SDSU came back and eve~tually tied it 12-12 on rwo 
straight TriLOn errors. The two 
teams went back and forth and 
were deadlocked at 14-14 until 
UCSD was overpowered by the 
Aztecs, 14 -16 . 

Like the previous one, game 
number 3 was a display of a 
powerful Triton attack, this time 

in the form of blocking. This 
game had a vel)' slow stan due 
to dogged play by both squads, 
resulting in numerous side-outs. 
SDSU took a slow lead which the 
Tritons thwarted to go ahead 6-
3. Again , the Aztecs tied it at 7-7 
and lost it on their own blocking 
errors which UCSD took 
advantage of to lead 12-8. 
However, SDSU determination 
proved dominant over that of the 
Tritons once again as UCSD lost 
the final in a heartbreaker, 14-
16. 

The dogged and determined 
play of individuals on the Triton 
squad was apparent throughout 
the match. Four players had kill 
totals in double figures, the 
outstanding player being 
freshman Matt Bellers who had 
14 kills on 29 attempts and 
committed only one hunting 
error for a whopping .448 hitting 
percentage. Others included jeff 
Babcock with 16 kills on 35 
attempts for a .314. percen~ge;. 
Chris Carpenter With 12 kills on

Cheating 
Continued from page 3 
witnessed or attended a class 
where a student had been caught 
cheating, only two of the forty 
polled answered affirmatively. 

Upon asking both students 
and faculty of their estimate of 
the percentage of cheating 
occuring at any given time 
during a midterm or final , the 
average estimate was that 8% of 
an entire lecture hall was 
engaging in academic 
dishonesty. 

Bev Varga, Dean of Third 
College, commented that 
plagiarism is the most common 
form of cheating that she has 
been aware of at Third College. 
She went on to say that the 
majority of cheaters were "mainly 
freshmen and sophomores that 
come in directly from high 
school, and are not aware of the 
rigorous demands that a 
university of this caliber has 
developed." 

Varga added that "(foreign) 
students with language 
difficulties in their coDege 
writing classes, have been having 
the most trouble with 
plagiarism." 

Dean Marsh felt differently 
about Warren College's foreign 
students. "My foreign students 
feel that this is a highly 
individualistic society, where 
cheating is more common and 
acceoted than other countries." 

When questioned whether· 
or not the practices currently 
implemented by professors to 
discourage cheating were 
effective, results showed that the 
students were split in their 
views, whereas the staff and 
faculty unanimously approved of 
the efforts of UCSD to deter 
academic dishonesty. 

Economics Professor Mark 
Machi na stated that his 
precautions to deter cheatin2 
have been effective. Machina 
assigns seats and tests for each 
student, as wen as requiring 
student 1.0. for entry into the 
exam area. Machina reasoned 
the "The amount of cheating is 
very much influenced by the 
procedures adopted during 
exams." 

Machina also went on to say 
that he is "Troubled by the 
amount of times students 
complained that they saw others 
cheating during exams, but

didn 't report it:" and added that 
"If people successfully chcat, It 
bumps the honest people down 
the curve." 

Unlike Dean Dreilinger's belief 
that the majority of cheating is 
more prevalent in the upper half 
of the class curves, Machina felt 
that "Most of the cheating 
occurred in the lower half of the 
curve, where people are failing to 
work, not because they are not 
as able, but because they aren't 
willing to work as much as the 
others." 

The majority of the deans 
agreed that the most effective 
deterrent was prevention. "If the 
professor states in the syllabus 
and before each exam his 
policies on cheating, that in itself 
would be vety effective: said 
Dean Varga. 

The general opinion of the 
staff, faculty and students is that 
the current policy of academic 
dishonesty is effective when 
enforced, but according to a 
professor, who wishes to remain 
anonymous, "Most cases are not 
brought to the Judicial 
Committee, let alone the Ad Hoc. 
Sometimes it's not necessary." 

Dean Dreillngcr said that the 
deans decide if it is necessary 
for an alleged cheater to be 
heard in front of the committees. 
Dreilinger went on to say the "If 
the student is found guilty, he 
has the right to appeal the 
charges. But if he is found 
Innocent the case is dismissed 
without further action against the 
student and no record on hiS 

transcript~ Drei.linRer concluded. 
VelY SimIlar to the possible 

deterrents for cheating 
volunteered by students in the 
random poll, the memo authored 
by the college deans suggested 
that professors "Check students 
I.D., trade students' blue books 
for pre-marked ones, avoid the 
use of crib notes, take freque nt 
head counts, aVOId repeating 
tests from past years, and 
request the removal of backpacks 
from the testi ng area before an 
exam starts ," and also suggested 
that photocopies be made of 
random exams to discourage 
students from retuming. altered 
exams to be recorrected. 

A recent Darmouth exchange 
student, Dan Lavin, suggested a 
possible solution to the cheating

dilemma when he compared 
Dartmouth College's "honor 
code" with UCSD's current 
policy. The honor code is an 
understanding, that the professor 
has with his students, that 
students have a responsibility to 
uphold the academic standards 
of the university and are trusted 
to do so when professors leave 
the lecture halls during emire 
exams. 

"The honor code doesn't deter 
the amount of cheating ... but 
something with the code makes 
you feel proud when the 
professor walks out of the room ," 
Lavin said . 

Another Dartmouth exchange 
student, Vicky Wall , commented 
that "The students feel insulted 
here (at UCSD) because of the 
amount of policing," whereas in 
Dartmouth , the peer/ressure 
"makes it really a ba thing to 
cheat, and here it is accepted." 
The majority of faculty and staff 
were doubtful that the honor 
code Is a solution to the cheating 
dilemma as well as a solution to 
the degredation that students feel 
when being "policed." 

Professor Machina stated, 

i NEWS 
"from my discussions with 
students who have operated 
under such a system, it just 
seems that this type of system 
gives dishonest students more 
room to be dishonest and hurts 
honest students even more. It's 
tOO bad we don't live in a world 
where that would work." 

Student David Birken, a 
member of the Revelle Judicial 
Committee, commented that "We 
all feel condescended upon. for 
every one cheater there are 200 
honest people. It's a moral 
obligation. Everyone knows that 
cheating is wrong, but they cheat 
anyway. So the honor code 
would never be effective." 

Student and TA Amy Perlstein 
expressed her feelings on 
academic dishonesty, "It's such 
an achievement to do well at this 
school. .People can feel reaDy 
good about their grades when 
they work for them. But when 
you cheat, you have to live with 
yourself and your low standard 
of morals. It's a competitive 
instiTUtion , and cheating can 
unforrunately take an A away 
from somebody who really 
worked." 1m

Finding funds 
Continued from page 8 
. "This situation has resulted an 
artificial limits placed on the 
growth of the program which in 
tum will ultimately lead to 
diminished relative and absolute 
participation. The university 
conducts its SPOrtS programs in 
space developed for a campus

including: new indoor facilities,

of existing facilities. 
. "In about two or three years,

Item: Fundraising 
ot surprisingly, money is the 

bonom line . According to Katy 
Haberkern's report to the 
Registration Fee Comminee, "The 
program has not been able to 
realize its potential because of a 
severe lack of funding." Strategies 
for this constant dilemma -
directly related to UCSD's "rare 

"The program has not

potential because oj a

-Katy Haberkem 

ci rcumstance of bemg both a 
Division III school and a pubhc 
university" - are as prevalent as 
the problems themselves. Two 
feasible routes to the alleviation 
of this monetary bind eXist. The 
first path is through a sports 
relation director (currently m 
use), and the second , through a 
fundraiser. 

Three years ago, twO 
temporary sports relations 
positions were approved by the 
Reg Fee Committee. According to 
athletic director Judy Sweet , the 
positions are essential to the 
growth of UCSD's athletic 
community. "We feel that the 
spons info roure is currently 
more important than the 
establishment of a fundraising 
position." The positions under 
Judy Malone and Laurel Dean are 

till temporary and are 
susceptible to yearly approval. 

The hiring of a profe-ssional 
full -time fund raiser for the 
athletic depaltment has been a 
point of contention among many 
people, including many of the 
coaches. Presently, the only 
fundraising done is by the 
athletes and coaches themselves 
and often centers around raising 
money for essential equipment 
and travel expenses. Almost 
every spon does some form of 
fund raising that takes away from 
the athletes' and coaches' time 
and energy. For example , the 
swim team must also do the 
landscaping at Canyonview in 
order to pay their travel 
expenses for our of state meets. 
Last year, the baseball team was 
painti ng curbs around the 
neighborhood in order to raise 
funds for equipment to maintain 
their playing field . These, and 
many other examples, help 
account for the followi ng 
statement in Katy Haberkern's 
survey of UCSD's top athletic 
concerns: "Their most important 
priority was a higher travel 
budget. second priority was new 
equipment, third was higher 
coaches' salaries, fourth was 
better facilities and fifth was new 
uniforms." 

The reliance on a spons info 
program over fundraising has 
raised a few eyebrows. Some 
have argued that the greatest gate 
receipts and community · 
notoriety do not come from 
merely publicizing the events. 
Quality produCts on the field and 
courts versus other top progams 
is the route to success. A full-
time fundraiser, the argument 
goes, would be able to raise 
funds to increase coaches 
salaries, Improve facilities and 
provide eqUipment up to par 
with other schools of UCSD's 
size and stature. Sweet has said 
that a spons fund raiser would be 
financially detrimental to the 
sports info department and that 
gening a professional fundraiser 
would be "like competing against 
ourselves (for fees from the Reg 
Commi ttee). Right now our 
priori ty is to generate enthusiasm 
and spirit on campus." 

The fundraiser issue is not 
new. Sweet's five year plans have 
included establishing a 
fundraising position. In 1984, Joe 
White , Jr., submitted a proposal 
to the Reg Committee advocating 
the hiring of a fund raiser. In 
comparing UCSD to the other 
UC campuses, White suggested 
that the only way to alleviate the 

athletic budgets' reliance on 'the 
regi tratlon fund s (reg fces pays 
for approximately 80 percent of 
the LA. budget) was to hi re a 
full-time fundraiser. His findings, 
however, revealed some 
fundamental problems, primarily 
a concern voiced by the athletic 
director at UC Irvine, Joe 
SinglctOn, who "expressed some 
concern about UCSD's ability to 
successfully obtain funding from 
the community with only a 
Division III program." 

Others have chided the 
department for failing to 
capitalize on existing 
opportunities to generate 
community interest in the 
athletic program. Erik Saltmarsh, 
assistant crew coach, feels that 
"within the communiry there is a 
general feeling that UCSD is son 
of self·sufficient, that they belong 
to a university program whose 
budget exceeds that of most 
countries. UCSD sits on some of 
the most prime land in all of 
Southern California. Everytime 
you hear about them they're 
geuing $1 million for lipid 
research or some other 
expensive program. The 
community feels we are too busy 
or aloof to get their help." 

Saltmarsh cites as an example 
an instance directly related to 
the crew teams' equipment woes. 
Wealthy members of the 
community, according to 
Saltmarsh, are willing to help the 
local crew programs in order to 
receive the prestige and notoriety 
associated with campuses su h 
as UCSD, SDSU and USD. for 
the past few years, a local retiree 

and crew buff has donated five 
shells - two to U D and twO 
and one half to SDSU -
although he had no affiliation 
with ei ther campus. "These local 
people throw functions," said 
Saltmarsh, "and these other 
schools have reaped the bencfits 
because they've gone there and 
rubbed elbows with these 
gentlemen, patted them on the 
back and told them what a nice 
job they're doing on the Crew 
Classic, and walk home with a 
boat We need someone with 
clout from UCSD - not just a 
team member, but a 
representative of the university to 
go and give the pitch. These 
guys give out Christmas gifts, but 
only to those who send them 
letters. We don 't do anything to 
make them feel important, and 
that's all they want. We're 
(UCSD) not doing a vety good 
job of playing the game: 

Other structural flaws stand in 
the way of an athletic fund raiser. 
According to Sweet, there is a 
reluctance on the part of the 
administration because the 
position of a salary-percentage 
fundraiser is "contrary to 
common personnel procedures." 
According to Saltmarsh, the 
Office of Planning and 
Development is not exactly 
aiding the cause. "First of all , 
they're not really designed for 
some of the individual budget 
requests of the athletic teams. 
Why spend two days generating 
$10,000 for a crew shell when 
you can spend those days 
pitching for a million dollar 
research grant? The development 
office is also leary that some of 
the funds generated by an 
independent fund raiser might 
come from the same places they 
get their money."

I $2.00 OFF ANY LARGE PIZZA I The home of the 

the part of the athletic 
depanment. Singlcton (UCD) 
speculated that while there are 
problems developing a 
commu nity suppon system for a 
Division 1II program, he felt that 
If any success was made 
eventually pressure might be 
exerted by some of the sponsors 
to improve the program. Sweet 
echoed these se ntiments in 
defense of Division 1II by saying 
that "when the founding fathers 
established this university it was 
clearly stated that they wanted to 
avoid the pitfalls of big-time 
athletic programs like recruiting 
and boosters." White's 1984 
proposal refutes many of these 
concerns. 

. Regarding competitive in-house 
fundraising efforts, White cited 
Ben Kobayashi 'S efforts with 
Campus Recreation . "Ben, as well 
as myself. feels the location of 
this university is such to make 
available more funding sources 
than can be reasonably utilized ." 
- Concerns about booster clubs 
were countered by the success of 

"We're (UCSD) not doing 
a very good job playing the 
(fundraising) game." 

-Erik Saltmarsh, 
Assistant Crew Coach 

academic institutions like 
Stanford and UC Berkeley. 
. Finally , according to White , 
"instead of being reluctantly 
stagnated at their current level, 
IA could be allowed to grow 
into a more visible part of UCSD 
and help unite the student body 
by providing more school spirit 
and pride. This would apply to 
the surrounding community as 
well as the students because a 
large part of any fund raising 
effort would be to promote 
interaction between the campus 
and the community." White's 
repon was submitted in 1984. In it, 
White reported that Joe Halvaks, 
UC Irvine's Intercollegiate Athletic 
business manager, offered to help 
establish a position similar to the 
one that exists at UCI and UCSB. 
Asked whether she would take the 
help that was offered in 1984, 
Sweet replied, "Of course, I'd take 
any help." 

Erratum: Last Monday's article 
included two sligh! errors. UCSD is 
"seven and a half times larger than 
any of its competition," should have 
read "seven and a half times larger 
than its average competition." In 
addition, coaches earn between 
$2,000 and $13,000, not between 
$6,000 and $13,000. ~

i Sisterly' Love 
I 
: by john singh 
I There are really four separate and distinct stories in Woody Allen's 
I latest and arguably best film, Hannah and Her Sisters. To inextricably 
I intertwine so many plots and subplots would be an almost 
I insurmountable difficulty for a lesser talent, but Allen takes only the most 
I important moments in each story and comes out a winner. 
I This is an important technique that Allen has mastered through the 
I years (which is why his films are always 20 or 30 minutes shorter than 
I most films, but infinitely richer) and, despite flaws which Allen himself 
I said (in GQ) changed the film into a different one than he had originally 

intended, one which makes Hannah and Her Sisters one of the most 
fulfilling movies in a long, long time. 

Beginning during one Thanksgiving dinner at Hannah's house and 
ending at the same two years later, Hannah is more than merely a character I 
study or a diatribe on life in angst in New York (as was his Manhattan), but 
an affecting portrait of some very interesting and touching lives led by 
people not so very different from the audiences who will see and love the 
film. Allen has chosen his characters carefully - Hannah (Mia Farrow), 
her sisters Lee and Holly (Barbara Hershey and Dianne West), her 
husband Elliott (Michael Caine) and her ex-husband Mickey (Allen)-
and has fleshed them out fully. With the exception of hypochondriac 
Mickey, a role rather blatantly written and performed to remind us of 
Allen's comic; touch, these are achingly real and infinitely intriguing 
people, who we come to know and respect, even if we don't always like 
them. And even Mickey ends up winning our sympathies when he.. 
provides the film with a scene not unlike last year's Purple Rose of Cairo. 

It is !llso obvious that with Hannah, Allen has not lost his striking visual 
sense either. The film is segmented into mini-chapters, each introduced 
with a witty title card (the first segment, for example, is given the title, 
"God, she's beautiful ... " which also serves as the film's telling opening 

I line). Most stunning, though, is the climactic lunch between the sisters, in 
which Carlo di Palma's camera swirls non-stop around the three, ever 
closer, until one of them finally breaks. Scenes like these are what makes 
Hannah and Her Sisters more brilliant, almost, than it has any right to be. 

Perhaps it is too easy to overrate Hannah and Her Sisters. After all, it isn't 
really the most powerful or stunning film of the year, and it doesn't really 
make any sort of wild or angry statement about what it observes. But to 
expect that would be to see another film, a remake of Annie Hall, for 
instance. In fact, it may be for this reason that Allen's Mickey fails; he is 
too overbearing a character and too wacky to be such a large part of this 
film, which may be what Allen, as writer and director means when he says 
this is not the film he set out to make.

Broadcasting live from 
Tuna, Texas, are radio 
announcers Thurston 
Wheelis and Aries Struvie, 
reporting on all the ' great 
events of the day in that 
bustling town: the demise of 
the judge who died of a stroke 
(a nd was found wearing a Dale 
Evans swimSUit), a young 
champion of the humane 
society giving his pitch over 
the radio to save a homeless 
puppy called "Yippy" and 
endangered ducks, as well as 
promoting other worthy 
animal causes; and a letter 
read on the air to a Mrs. Pearl 
Burras who's been accused of 
poisoning neighborhood dogs 
that come too close to her 
chickens. Yes, life as it is, deep 
in the heart of Texas. 

LIVE from Tuna, 'rexas! 
certain costume accessories 
c arried over from one 
character to the next, which 
was a bit confusing for the 
audience. 

Greater Tuna, a play by 
Jaston Williams,loe Sears and 
Ed Howard, was first 
performed in New York in 
1982. In San Francisco, the 
writers themselves also acted 
in it. Last year, the play was 
held over at the Old Globe 
Theatre here in San Diego, 
and then last Friday and 
Saturday night, over in the 
Warren Apartment complex, 
the play was performed to a 
small but enthusiastic 
audience by two students, 
Reggie Mathes and Seth 
Kaplan. 

Mathes, who was responsi-
blee for the organization and 
much of the directing of G. T., 
decribes the playas a "spoof 
of Texas." It's essentially a 
"day in the life" of a "typical" 
small town community -
sort of a twisted variatio'n of 
Ulysses. All the main types are 

represented: the reverend 
(Rev. Spikes), the housewife 
(Bertha Bumiller) with her 
reform school son, the 
committeewoman (Vera 
Carp) with her mission to ban 
all evil or suggestive words 
from the dictionary. 

Says Mathes, one of the 
reason.~ for choosing this 
comical satire was the 
simplicity of the set (two 

by sue nPt· .. ra 

tables, a few chairs, recorded 
sound tracks and a Glamour 
magazine) along with the fact 
that as few as two people 
could perform the entire show 
- two people, but 19 
characters (and one dog), 
which also included five 
women. (This simply added 
to the humor of it, seeing the 
two actors in drag.) 

Overall, the writing is very 

funny. As for the acting, when 
only two characters were on 
stage, one wondered where all 
the others were - so 
convincingly did Mathes and 
Kaplan populate the entire 
town with their dramatic 
interpretations. Naturally, 
there were a few technical 
difficulties, what with the 
quick (and frequent) costume 
changes. Towards the end, 

Nevertheless, the acting was 
highly commendable - even 
surprisingly so, for Greater 
Tuna wasn't what one might 
expect from a free perform-
ance in the Warren Commons 
building which had limited 
advertising. 

GreateT Tuna follows on the 
heels of another Warren 
College production, Bleacher 
Bums, which was performed 
by actors with little to no 
acting background. Another 
comedy, written by a troup of-
actors from Chicago, Bleacher 
Bums was about faithful 
Chicago Cubs fans standing in 
the bleachers, waiting for their 
team to win a game. This 
particular production was 
organized by Farrell Foreman, 
who teaches dramatic writing 
here on campus. 

There is a concept behind 
these performances. Mathes 
talks of the purpose of such 
shows as being entertainment 
and diversion. "Theatre that 
people can enjoy, get 
something out of- even if it's 
just getting away from the 
books." And it is the hope of 
Foreman that such perform. 
ances can become a regular 
event, with two plays a 
quarter, and involve students 
who may not have had the 
opportunity to be involved in 
dramatic production before. 
Next quarter, or in the near 
future, there may even be a 
production of a play written 
by a student

Buzzard Picks 
Jethro Clean in 

Hawaiian Championships! 
Yea ... they said it couldn't be done . But it 

really did happen, folks. 
After three years of lOtally dominating 

the Hawaiian Football population on 
campus, the mighty TKE's of Tau Kappa 
Epsilon finally tasted the bitte rsweet of 
burnt buzzard. 

You bet! And if that sounds a bit ugly lO 
one's senses, you should have seen it. It 
was uglier, believe me. 

In a game as wild as the rules, Dan 
Walter's Bloody Moustache group 
whi pped up on the TKE's last Friday in the 
Open Hawaiian Football Championship 
game. The score was 80-70. It sounds 
close ... but it wasn't! 

Using a unique mirror defensive 
alignement that shadowed each and every 
TKE lO the max, the Moustachers ended a 
three-year run of dominance by Todd 
Stayart'S well-drilled Hawaiians. 

The key to the upset win was a rather 
simple one. Walters turned the 'Buzzard' 
loose. It was his best of many moves that 
day. With TKE rallying furiously midway 
through the second half, Walters aashed 
the green light to roverback Todd (the 
Buzzard) Norton . On cue, the Buzzard 
read screen pass and 10 and behold Bob 
Oethro) Armell's weak aip pass to the 
Uanks was picked clean. 

The Buzzard romped into the end zone , 
and the rest was history. With an 
insurmountable 30-point lead and time 
running out, the Bloody boys hung on for 
the win. 

For Walters, it was extra sweet. The win 
gave him the first known triple crown in 
1M football history. His teams won Men's 
AM and Coed AA last fall and with his big 
win Friday, Dan was looking for new 
worlds to conquer. 

In the 'A' Championship game, La 
Machine did a number on the Homegrown 
Hawaiians, winning easily 88-36.

Overview: 

This is a tremendously balanced AM 
bracket for one of the few times in recent 
history. All four teams have plenty of 
strengths and each has a weakness or two 
that could be explOited: 

e Addicted boards well and has ex-
Triton Brandon Nixon at guard . 
• The Herd has plenty of balance 
WIth Adams, Kilty and Bennett doing 
most of the damage. 
• Drs. Dunk has the franchise player 
in ex-Davis standout PresIOn 
Neumayr, but the rest of their club is 
much better than in past seasons. 
eThe Triton Pub has almost tOO 
much talent. Mark Barreca IS without 
a doubt the best big man in IMs , but 
the team cherrUstry is suspect. Only 
five players can playatonce, and the 
last rime we checked, you still only 
use one ball. This wiu present 
another unique coaching challenge 
for basketball genius Tom Marshall .

Overview: 

You should be able to mail this one in . 
Pettis, Hughes, Knecht and the boys from 
Straight Up know how to light up the 
scoreboard. The battle for second could be 
interesting: 

e Masons . a johnny-corne-lately to 
the serious action might just be the 
hot team for the moment. Their 45-
41 upset of La Machine gives strong 
indication that these guys may be 
able to get it up one more time. 
e Life After Semi can definitely be a 
force, but they'll need the big guy ... 
Pat Flynn ... to have the game of his 
life . 
e Brick City is nor the team it sounds 
like. Mike Durroff and the Holness 
Bros. can playa Htde. But then again, 
they're going to need to playa lot to 
keep up with Straight Up.

CNerview: 

This divsion could get decided as early 
as the semis. The two clubs with the big '0', 
Firmly Established and Small Towers 
should meet Thursday night in a classic 
battle of Irresistable Force vs. Immovable 
Object. 

• Sons of I;llen B pulled otT the big 
upset Sunday with a 34-33 crowd 
pleaser over season-long No. 1 
WatSOn's Discount Liquor. In close 
garnes, they'll be a factor. 
e The youngsters of the pack, Great 
White Hope, has been looking for a 
little ink and even more respect all 
season long, and perhaps, finally , 
they made believers out of us. Dave 
Nott and Rob Bernstein lead a well-
balanced attack, but do they have 
the big game experience to pull off a 
sweep to the finals? 
e OO Yacht dub is just begging for 
one more shance at Small Towers, 
the only team to defeat them during 
the regular season.

Here's one play-otT division that has 
tremendous potential for producing some 
stunning upsets. There are plenty of 
sleepers in this bunch, but trying to figure 
out who they are going to be is no picnic . 

On paper, you can't argue with the 
Budman's favorite team, th e Smokeless 
Buds. Walters, Vasil ,Armell , Lumsden and 
Looie have been to the bank every year. 
Their 29-game winning streak speaks for 
itself. However, there are plenty of solid 
warriors hanging out in the bush: 

e Killer Pygmies pushed the Buds to 
the limit in last year's semis, and 
they are pla~ng with plenty of 
authonty thIS tlme around . 
e Also, Jordan Force should be just 
that. Their narrow 56-52 loss to the 
Pygmies earlier in the season has 
them itching for revenge .

Maxwell, Monica Bradley and Mary 
Logan are still the same devastating 
scorers of a year ago. But the new 
found long range accuracy of point

1M Scoop 
The last games were played thiS past 

weekend on the field we all affectionately call 
"Lake Pryatel." Appropriately the field was it's 
usual self, with at least an inch of standing water 
on all pans of the field. Many a time we have all 
had some kind of wonderful experience on the 
Lake. Ruining your favority pair of shons while 
sliding; falling in the mud and coming up with a 
fish in your mouth; tearing up body parIS any 
time you fall; putting your life on the Ime 
retrieving a ball in frOnt of a speeding car; and 
many, many more memorable ones. 

Pryatel Field will be closed next quarter for a 
complete renovation. Drainage will be added, 
along with new soil and grass. A crown will be 
PUI on the field and fences will be added. We all 
hope everything goes well .... That will leave us 
wi th JUSt twO fields for our biggest intramural 
sport, softball . Fret not, we should be able to 
accomodalc the sam e number of teams thai we 
had a year ago. 

We will start soflballihe very first weekend of 
the quarter, 10 make sure thal we can finish the 
season. Captains ... get your teams ready and 
organized now. 

Some funds have been approved and a 
contractOr is being selected for the beginnings 
of a new Rec Spons Complex, nonh of the 
super computer. Eventually, we hope to have to 
super 500 foot 500 fields , an all-weather track, 
12 new tenOlS couns with a stauium coun, and 
lasuy a beautiful new multi purpose indoor 
recreation cemer.

Dream Teamer's Dream Shattered 
by 35·footer at the Buzzer! 

In the shon space of a few days the Story you are about to hear has become legendary. In 
fact. it still is not to be believed. Yet, phenomenally, it did happen and will go down in 
Intramural Spons annals as the most amazing and exciting five seconds in the history oflM 
Basketball at UCSD. 

To set the stage, we all need a litde background first. It's Sunday evening, last Sunday to be 
exact, and the Main Gym is buzzing with play-off intensity. The feature Men's AAA game of 
the evening is set to go. 

In one comer, we have Addicted, Paul Rasmussen's top-ranked AM club that so far is 
unbeaten, untied and untested. No surprise here. Addicted features ex-Triton basketballer 
Brandon Nixon, no doubt the finest point guard playing this quarter. 

Their opponents, the Dream Team. a group of talented young hoopsters, captained by Mr. 
Personality himself, Rex (Tiny) Vaughan. Tiny's team is )-) and really has no busineSS being 
in the game with Addicted. But you're not going to tell Tiny that! 

His guys are playing the game of their lives. With )() seconds to go, the Dream Team is 
down by a pair, 49-47, but has the ball. Everyone in the gym is anxiously awaiting the 
outcome. Tiny's guys work the ball methodically for 23 seconds or SO and then in 
desperation get it to 6'6* freshman, Andy Wagstaff, who pUIS up an off-balanced jumper 
with) ricks remaining. The shot has no chance. but Wagstaff gets fouled. 

Hey, this is excinng. WagstalThas a chance to lie it and send the game into ovenime. That 
in itself would be quite an accomplishment for such an underrated team. 

But wait a minute now. Wagstaff has got to be feeling some pressure. I mean after aiL the 
guy has only been in school for two lousy quarters. And he still has got to sink 'em both. 

Wagstaff goes swish! ... swish! ... without blinking an eye. Wow! We got to O.T. right? No, 
no, no! 

Paul Rasmussen steps on the baseline attempting to inbound for a last second shot for 
Addicted. Holy Toledo! The Dream Team now has a chance to win the game! In their hurry 
to set-up for the in-bounds play. Tiny's guys get a litte confused, but then allof a sudden Ray 
Brown breaks out of a pack of players and somehow gets free breaking across the lane. The 
ball goes into Ray who pUIS it up and in. 

Pandemonium breaks out. What an incredible finish. What an upset! Dream Team 51. 
Addicted 49! The Dream Teamers are going absolutely bonkers! 

But hold on a second! The referees check with the timer and believe it or not, we've still 
got One Big Second left on the clock. Oh well, routine ... what else can possibly happen. 

Referees Bob Armell and Marc Dauber restore what little order is left in the gym and 
patiently line every one up for the in-bounds play and the last tick on the clock. 

This time Paul Rasmussen doesn't step on the line. His pass goes clear down coun to Mark 
Pachowicz who is standing JUSt inside the the half coun stripe. Mark grabs the pass, whirls 
and heaves the ball from 350feet out. As the ball leaves his hand the buzzer goes off. 

The ball arches gently toward the hoop and then everyone hears that magic sound., . 
whoosh! Nothing but net! Unbelievable! Seven points in three seconds and all of them legit. 
Pachowicz' three pointer gives Addicted new play-off life ... 52-51! 

Someone give me a light! ...... A Bud Light!

Super 
Sushi 
by robert leone 

The Shiroi Hana is a fish 
market, restaurant and sushi 
bar on the corner of Felspar 
and Mission. It occupies a 
low, wooden building painted 
with blue and white waves, 
shares a parking lot with an 
Alberto's drive~up, and is 
next door to a modest video 
and pinball arcade that is 
popular with the local under-
18 crowd. This casualness, 
but not seediness, is carried 
over to the Shiroi Hana itself. 

The sushi bar, which is of 
the standard model, features 
some of the best sushi I've 
tasted, at close to some of the 
best prices. The lunch special 
at $3.98 is a good deal, except 
for the vegetable rolls, which 
are so wide in diameter and 
short in depth that I couldn't 
pick them up with chopsticks 
without having them crumble. 
The California rolls of crab 
and avocado were made with 
fresh ingredit!nts, and the 

-----, miso soup (part of the 
package) was warm and had 
lots of green peppers and a 
number of tofu chunks at the 
bottom. All in all, the sushi 
lunch special is a good deal. 
Other' items on the extensive 
sushi menu are competitively 
priced and competently 
prepared. 

RUN FOR COVER! 
The original cost is coming to save their school .. . 

and it's open season on anyone who gets within range!

Those who don't eat or like 
sushi will be thrilled with the 
restaurant menu. If the sushi 
lunch is a decent light lunch, 
the $3.95 chicken teriyaki 
special is a substantial dinner. 
The teriyaki sauce was simple, 
but flavorful. The amount of 
chicken was about what you'd 
expect for less than four

fresh salad and correctly 
moist rice that accompanied it 
were not. All were served on 
the same plate, but it took me 
10 minutes of eating to 
discover that the plate was 
divided into three ' compart~ 

ments. It was definitely a full 
meal, and a decently prepared 
one at that. 

For those who want more, 
the selections of fish meat

more than a dozen, including

Living with someone for the first time can be an 
"educational" experience. 

And living with a long distance company isn't any 
different. Because some companies may not give you 
all the services you're used to getting from AT&T. 

For instance, with some companies you have to 
spend a certain amount before you qualify for their 
special volume discounts. With some others, voice 
quality may vary. 

But when you choose AT&T, there won't be any 
surprises when you move in. You'll get the same high-
quality, trouble-free service you're used to. 

With calls that sound as close as next door. And 
discounts off our Day Rate on your state-to-state calls. 

With savings of over 50% during weekends until 5pm 
Sundays, or nights from llpm to 8am, Sunday through 
Friday. And 40% discounts evenings between 5pm and 
lIpm, Sunday through Friday. 

With AT&T, you'll continue to get services like im-
mediate credit for wrong numbers and collect calling. 
And long distance operators to help you anytime there's 
a problem on the line. 

So when you're asked to choose a long distance com-
pany, choose A1&T. Because whether you're into Mozart 
or metal, q~ality is ~he one thing everyone can agree 
on. Call 1 800 222-0300 for more information or to 
choose AT&T.
