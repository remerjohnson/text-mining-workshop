Wednesday for taking bribes. He 
is the highest official put to death

Parking to Offer More Options 
COlT: Students will soon be able to buy three-day-a-week 
permits at a discount of 40 percent off the regular price 

Stsffwrlter 

The UC5D administration is in the 
process of developing parking permits 
that will be valid for three selected days of 
the week at 40 percent off the regular 
price. 

U the proposal is accepted, the adminis-
tration Will offer a three-day permit for 
Monday, Wednesday, Friday and for 
Tuesday, Thursday, Friday. Both of these 
permits would allow students to park on 
campus past 4:30 p.m. o~.any <!a.y. 

ReveDe senior Doc ~ has been 
working on the pro;ect and said he believes 
these new permits will be beneficial to all 
students, especially those who only come to 
campus three days a week. 

HThis would reduce parking congestion 
because on days students didn't have a 
permit to park but still had to come to 
campus, they would use alternative means 
such as public transportation or carpools," 
Khalegtil said. H Also, it would probably 
just decrease the need to go to campus by , 
creating incentives for students to con-
dense their activities into the three offered 
days." 

Khaleghi said the decrease in price 
would make parking more affordable for 
students. 

"It's finally a sign that the administration 
is trying to loOk after the best financial inter-
est of the student body," Muir freshman 
Chris Peuvre\1e said. NAt least they are try-
ing to help out students since they already 
rip us off with parking." 

The current permit proposal applies 
only to student (5) spots, but staff (B) spots 
mal, be included due to recent demand. 

Ever since it was proposed, we have 
gotten lois of positive feedback from both 
undergraduates and graduate students who 
would like to see this expanded to the B per-
mits:' Khaleghi said. "I definitely think that 
is feasible." 

Khaleghi said he foresees a future with 
even more affordable parking options fQr 
students. 

"It would be great to offer more options, 
but for the beginning stages the options are 
limited." he said. "Hopefully in the future it 
will be expanded to offer more alternative 
arrangements. " 

Marshall freshman Adam Huie said he 
believes these permits will benefit stu-
dents who have class only three days a 
week. 

Hif I was only taking classes on Monday, 
Wednesday and Friday, this would save me 
a lot of money," he said. HI hope they start

UCSD's International Center sent a 
record 621 students abroad last year, sur-
passing all other UC campuses. 

Mary Dhooge, director of the 
International Center and dean of interna-

number of students studying abroad to the 
variety of programs offered by the universi-
ty. 

"UCSD has a special commitment to 
studying abroad," she ~id . "In addition to 
the University of California's Education 
Abroad ~rogram, we have a UCSD-based 
Opportunities Abroad Program, which 
allows students to participate in a whole 
range of study abroad programs."

UCSD Students Deserve To 
Be Able To Buy C_.-ettes 

UCSD students are adults. and as such, they have 
the right to smoke. 

Last month, A.S. President Tesh Khullar and Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Joe Watson struck a 
"compromise" that will retise cigarette prices at the 
General Store Co-op by 25 cents. 

In an effort to make the campus smoke free, 
Watson asked the General Store to discontinue the 
sale of cigarettes. While General Store employees 
claim that they do not make much money from the 
sale of cigarettes, selling cigarettes on campus is a 
convenience for students. and it brings more cus-
tomers into the store. 

The Guardian recognizes that smoking is a dan-
gerous habit that causes cancer and other health prob-
lems. We also believe that in our society. people are 
well-informed of the dangers of smoking. Students 
are adults, however, and those who choose to smoke 
know the risks associated with this choice. 

Watson believes that the health risks involved with 
cigarette smoking far outweigh the convenience of 
being able to buy cigarettes on campus. The Guardian 
feels that students who smoke will do so regardless of 
whether they are able to buy cigarettes on campus. 
The ale of cigarettes on campus is just a convenience 
for those who already smoke. 

California has recently made several positive 
changes that promote a smoke-free society. Smoking is 
not allowed in public buildings, restaurants or bars. It 
is also illegal to smoke near a public building. The state 
recently passed an additional 50-cent tax on cigarettes 
that now funds anti-smoking campaigns and early 
childhood development programs. California has done 
plenty to discourage smoking and to educate people. 
especially children, about the dangers of smoking. Any 
further restrictions would be oppressive. 

Watson has acknowledged that he has no say in the 
matter and will leave the decision up to the students 
of UCSD, or more specifically, the A.S. Council. 
Unfortunately, Khullar struck a deal with Watson to 
raise cigarette prices by 25 cents per pack. 

General Store Manager George Gonzales opposes 
the compromise and said that General Store employ-
ees should have a say in the matter. We agree. 

The student-run General Store has the right to sell 
whatever it wants, so long as it is legal to sell those 
items. If the General Store would like to provide stu-
dents with the convenience of having cigarettes on 
campus, that is the decision of the students who run 
the store, not the decision of the administration.

. Campaign Reform Favors 
the ~ich and Incumbent 

COMMENTARY: McCain's proposed remedies would hurt democracy 
By BRADLEY ROOT 
Contributirw Writer 

Over the past few months, Sen. 
John McCain has successfully 
painted himself as the primary cru-
sader against corrupt campaign 
finance practices. This, combined 
with the overwhelming support of 
the press, has made McCain a very 
popular candidate. Although he 
has spent ample time devising a 
comprehensive reform of the cam-
paign finance system, McCain still 
can't see the horrible implications 
of his proposed reforms. 

McCain believes that the solu-
fon to government corruption is 
banning or limiting soft money 
donations, which are donations to 
political parties. He also wants to 
restrict the freedom of special inter-
est groups to run political adver-
tisements. McCain truly believes 
that further restrictions and regula-
tions such as these would make the 
system more fair. He couldn't be 
farther from the truth. 

First of all, McCain supporters 
should remember that soft money 
is a creation of the c~mpaign 
finance reforms of the Nixon era, 
which limited individual donations 
to $1,000 per candidate. This forced 
larger donations to be channeled 
through political parties. At the 
5;lme time, special interest FUps 
began using "direct issue' com-
mercials to indirectly promote cer-
tain candidates. McCain's pro-
posed campaign finance reforms 
are aimed at these two relatively 
new practices. He sees them as cor-
nerstones of the "Iron Triangle" of 
big money and corruption. 

What McCain does not realize is 
that any successful limits on cam-
paign contributions would favor 
the rich, well-connected candi-
dates. After all, Ross Perot could 
still finance his campaign without 
receiving outside donations. 
Magazine owners like Steve Forbes 
can buy favorable media coverage. 
AI Gore could rely upon the sup-

port of his media friends like 
Martin Peretz, whose magazine The 
New &public has endorsed Gore. 
Outside donations appear to be the 
only realistic way for less fortunate 
candidates to overcome these eco-
nomic and social advantages. 

Furthermore, limits on cam-
paign spending favor incumbent 
candidates, because they are 
already .... J\own by the public. Who 
in California could defeat Diane 
Feinstein without raising a huge 

Reforms that limit special 
interest groups prevent them

concerns and from 
instigating change.

amount of money? No one; she is 
too well-known. Campaign dona-
tions and advertising afford 
unknown and less privileged can-
didates the ability to air their ideas. 
Granted, these donations create 
inequalities between candidates, 
but unlike other inequalities (such 
as connections in the media and 
personal wealth), campaign funds 
are a reflection of public support. 

The major goal of campaign 
finance reform is to remove unfair 
advantages one candidate may 
have over another. The real effect, 
however, is to remove the inequali-
ties that reflect public opinion, 
while maintaining the inequalities 
of personal power. 

Practicality aside, spending caps 
and restrictions on campaign dona-
tions are, quite frankly, undemocra-
tic. Special interest groups are vital 
to the practice of democracy. 

Special interest groups such as 
CaIPIRG, the ACLU and the 
Campaign for Working Families are 
associations of concerned citizens; 
they bring new issues and ideas to 
the attention of politicians and 
force our representatives to 
respond to issues they might other-
wise ignore. Of course they endorse 
and lobby candidates - that's the 
whole point. 

Reforms that limit special inter-
est groups prevent them from 
expressing their concerns and from 
instigating change. Without com-
mercials and pamphlets from these 
special interest groups, many citi-
zens would get their only political 
information from the media. By 
denying grours the right to express 
their politica views, the "reform-
ers" would prevent open discus-
sion of issues in the public sphere. 
This is unacceptable. 

But even more basic is the ques-
tion of why special interest groups 
and individual contributors should 
be restricted in their exercise of free 
speech. Even if it did decrease gov-
ernment corruption (which it will 
never do), the limitations on special 
interest advertisements would 
'Silence many activist groups or 
limit their impact upon the political 
system. A system in which private 
groups and citizens cannot muster 
the same amount of influence over 
their representatives as the media 
can is undemocratic. 

A better altemative to increasing 
campaign regulations and Iimita-

.' tions is to remove them altogether. 
Lifting caps on direct donations 
would cut out a lot of the hassle 
that candidates go through to get 
funding. It would also make dona-
tions easier to track. Moreover, all 
candidates should be required to 
fully disclose every donation 
received . No ano!'ymous donors, 
no unknown amounts. That way, at 
least the voters will know which 
special interests a candidate repre-
sents.

Advertisements Should Not Infringe on Individuals' Religious Beliefs 
Editor: 

I am writing this letter to the 
Guardian in response to the "paid 
advertisement" asking if I "Agree 
with Michael." I am shocked and 
disturbed at the content of that 
specific advertisement. I am 
shocked that you have the audaci-
ty to print such belligerent trash at 
the ~pense of the student body, 
regardless of how much money 
the paper received. I am disturbed 
because you are supposed to cater 
to all facets of the student popula-

tion,yettlUsadv~entspeaks 
to a very specific portion of the 
population and alienates the rest. 

In addition to my shock and 
distress, I am personally offended 
by the content of the advertise-
ment. I too have spent the last five 
years tackling the issues of life, 
questioning what is wrong and 
right, and searching for a universal 
truth to adopt as my own. I too 
have studied various types of reli-
gions and cultures extensively in 
order to find one that suits me. 
Needless to say, I did not come to 
the same conclusions that Michael 
did. This does not mean that my 
problem rests in our religious dif-
ferences; rather, it stems from the 
moral implications of Michael's 
message. 

How dare he tell me that Jesus 
is the only way to reach God on a 
personal level? He is stating that 
any personal relationship that one 
may have with Allah, Buddha, 
Coniuc.ius, Vishnu or any other 
deity is morally wrong and unjus-
tified. You are stating that the time 
I spent absorbing and understand-
ing Muhammad, Paul and 
Abraham is worthless if I don't 
adhere to the same view that he 
does. What about my personal 
relationships to Marx, Locke, 
Freud, Sartre, Woolf, Nietzsche 
and Kafka? What about myexperi-

ences, wisdom, observations and 
emotions? ObviOusly, according to 
him, everything that I have seen, 
read and experienced is useless 
unless I come to the conclusion 
that Jesus is the only way to live 
my life. 

The difference between Michael 
and me is that I have come to my 
own conclusions by observing, 
understanding and appreciating 
differences between people. I real-
ize that different people come to 
different conclusions about how to 
make their lives meaningful. I 
have come to my own conclusions 
about what is right for me and 
only for me. I do not rreach my 
way of life to others. let others 
come to their own conclusions 
about how to lead their lives. I cer-
tainly don't tell people that their 
way of life is wrong and unjusti-
fied because they don't see things 
the way I do. 

I sincerely hope that others who 
are offended by all the "I Agree 
With Michael" crap will speak out 
against this obvious oppression. I 
hope that others will reach out for 
individuality and realize that it is 
people like Michael who detract 
from the moral goals of social uni-
fication and acceptance, of love 
and respect for differences, of 
breaking beyond the barriers of 
religion, culture, race and color.

"place of total sin," with everyone 
just trying "to get a dollar out of 
you." It is described as a "sick 
place" and the writer contends his 
disgust that "people actually lived 
there." 

Well, I am an out~f-state fresh-
man who just moved here from 
Las Vegas, and I can tell you from 
personal experience this assess-
ment is vague at best. Las Vegas is 
a growing community of close to 
one million people and there is 
much more to it than the narrow 
glimmer of lights along The Strip. 
Most visitors do not realize the 
vast stretch of residential and busi-
ness communities that extend 
beyond The Strir and operate 
independently 0 it. There are 
schools, hospitals, grocery stores, 
malls and even churches. 

Las Vegas is not so different 
from other cities when you see the 
entire picture. For the most part, 
people who live in the city are not 
out to make money off tourists, but 
instead are just trying to take 
advantage of the affordable hous-
ing and ample job opportunities. 
My family moved to Las Vegas in 
'94 for these very reasons; to get a 
fresh start on life. We used to live 
in a small, two-bedroom apart-
ment in Denver and when we 
came to Vegas we moved into a 
large four-bedroom house with a 
pool. My dad was able to get a bet-
ter job and the schools were even 
better then those we were attend-
ing in Colorado. 

Our life had nothing to do with 
the gambling or entertainment 
industry and was quite normal in 
many respects. Sure, The Strip was 
only a few miles down the road, 
but we only went there to ride the 
rides and see the shows, along 
with everyone else. Las Vegas may 
be at the heart of the gambring and 
entertainment industry, but it is far 
from representing the evils of the 
world or the corruptive nature of 
capitalism. That can be seen every-
where. The gambling industry is 
just like any other capitalistic ven-
ture and does what it must to 
make the most profit. 

Before condemning the gam-
bling and entertainment industry 
for feeding off the urges of the 
American people, he should take a 
look at the label on the back of his 
sweater or at the tag on the sole of 
his Nike shoes. Made in a third 
world, sweatshop-ridden country, 
these companies also feed off the 
urges of the American people. If he 
believes that Las Vegas is the cen-
ter of sin and evil then he must be 
blind to the capitalism that encom-
passes everyday life. 

Tourists who come to visit are 

not forced to spend money on 
gambling any more than those 
who go to a mall and are "forced" 
to buy designer clothes. The fact 
that people often partake in both 
activities is a result of the belief 
that such actions will have a posi-
tive impact on their lives. 
Gamblers like to believe that they 
have a good shot at winning, just 
like shoppers like to believe that 
deSigners clothes will improve 
their appearance. The reality is that 
most people who gamble will lose 
just like most people who buy 
designer clothing will never look 
like the models that flaunt their 
importance in magazines. 

To conclude, alii can say is that 
Las Vegas is not nearly as bad as 
the writer has made it out to be. 
Here's a word of advice: If he 
wants to see what Las Vegas is 
really like then he shouldn't gam-
ble. Visit sites beyond The Strip. I 
guarantee he will be a winner.

Campaign Seeks Discussion 
COMMENTARY: Students don't have to agree 
By SHANNON CASTLE 
Columnist 

Along with a bunch of other 
Christians at UCSD, I made quite a 
few people angry last week by wear-
ing a blue T-snirt with the words "[ 
Agree With Michael" printed across 
the front. Apparently, the display of 
faith and desire to share this faith 
with others offended a good portion 
of our audience. 

For those of you are still confused 
by the whole thing, I'll give you a 
brief synopsis. Last Monday, in a 
paid advertisement in the Guardia,l, 
a fourth-year student named 
Michael Carley described his per-
sonal journey to faith in Jesus Christ. 
He stressed God's love for each and 
every one of us and the fact that God 
sent Jesus to allow us to have per-
sonal relationships with Him. 
Several hundred UCSD Christians 
wore the "[ Agree With Michael" t-
shirts aU week to fadlitate campus 
disco ion about Christianity. 

While I hesitate to speak for such 
a large, diverse crowd of people, I 
don't think I would be incorrect to 
say that this campaign was not 
merely about awareness; it was 
about conversion. I would be 
thrilled if all of UCSD shared my 
beliefs. I will continue to share my 
faith with non-Christians in the 
hope that they will come to believe 
in the necessity of a personal rela-
tionship with Jesus Christ. This, 
unfortunately, is the point where I 
offend a lot of people. 

The majority of the anger 
expressed about the "Michael week" 
was directed at our claim that we 
know the truth, and at our desire to 
share this truth with others. Several 
people that [ talked to over the 
course of the week expressed the 
idea that we should tolerate all reli-
gions and view , and refrain from 
pu hing our views on other people. 
The prevailing opinion on campus 
seemed to be that all beliefs are 
equally valid. 

The problem wi th this kind of 
"tolerance" is that it is very selective. 

Our society, and our campus in par-
ticular, does not embrace the 
exchange of competing ideas and 
the tolerance of the expression of 
these ideas. Rather, it has adopted 
the idea that we must refrain at all 
costs from offending anybody. 
Charles Colson, of Watergate fame 
and now a member of the evangeli-
cal movement, wrote recently that 
"in today's relativistic environment, 
pluralism no longer means tolerat-
ing competing ideas, but rather 
forced neutrality: No one should 
express any idea that could offend 
another" (Christianity Today, Mar. 6). 

Unfortunately, by definition, 
any belief that something is infalli-
bly true is going to conflict with 
another person's idea of truth. If 
either side feels the need to con-
vince others that their belief is the 
truth, they are going to offend the 
others. A major tenet of the 
Christian faith is that we need to 
share the truth of God with the rest 
of the world. Though this might 
offend people who hold other 
beliefs, true "tolerance" would not 
obi·ect to the expression of these 
be. iefs, just as it would not object to 
the exrression of the opposite 
point 0 view. 

I do not advocate any kind of rel-
ativism here; [ believe in absolute 
truth. My point is that people plead 
for tolerance of different opinions 
while demonstrating total intoler-
ance of ideas that offend them. Our 
culture allows us to believe whatev-
er we want, as long as we don' t 
assert it as the truth, and as long as it 
doesn't conflict with the views of 
any other group. . 

U we are going to advocate toler-
ance of diverse opinions, we need to 
apply it across the board. Ju t as I 
am asking you to allow me to tell 
you that what I believe is the only 
truth, [ need to allow you to teU me 
that I am wrong. You probably 
won't change my mind, and I'll 
probably still agree with Michael, 
but I will allow you to try. I'd like 
you to do the same.

Cigarette Ads Pick on Smokers 
COMMENTARY: Anti-smoking ads have little redeeming value , 
By WARD HAN 
Associate Opinion Editor 

Two weekends ago I was 
immobilized because of a foot 
injury, so I sat in front of the TV 
for two days. During those 20 
hours of television, I was bom-
barded with annoying anti-
smoking commercials intended 
to brainwash me. 

I usually do not smoke, but I 
still do not like these tactics. 
One commercial depicted two 
teen-agers who find each other 
attractive at a party, but every-
thing changes when the boy 
takes out a .pack of cigarettes. 
Some crafty editing shows that 
the girl now sees him as a chim-
panzee playing with a pack of 
cigarettes. 

In a similar commercial, the 
roles of sexes are reversed. The 
disenchanted boy sees the girl 
as a fish monster as soon as she 
takes out a cigarette. 

In yet another commercial, 
some teenagers walk into a 
tobacco company and harass 
the workers to take a lie detec-
tor test on whether tobacco is 
addictive. 

[ have a lot of problems with 
these commercials, but I will 
start by making the point that 
these commercials are not fair 
to smokers. The commercial 
with the fish monste. tiJld chim-
panzee simply poke fun at 
smokers without providing any 
educational value. They do not 
warn about nicotine's addictive 
capabilities, nor the carcino-
genic effects of tar. Instead, they 
portray smokers as animals. 
The advertisers assume that by 
tarnishing the images of smok-
ers, no one will want be associ-
ated with cigarettes. 

By making 'smokers look 
stupid and dirty, advertisers 
encourage voters to pass initia-
tives to increase tobacco taxes 
and laws to prohibit smoking in 
certain places. After all, many 

of the anti-tobacco commercials 
end with the tagline, "funded 
by the Anti-Tobacco Initiative." 
However, bashing the public 
image of a group of people is 
not an ethical way to raise 
taxes. 

Smokers are already finding 
places where they can smoke 
disappearing. The only legal 
places to smoke in California 
are private homes and on the 
street 10 feet away from public 
buildings. There are people 
who want to pass legislation to 
prohibit smoking in apartments 
because the neighbors do not 
want smoke to drift into their 
homes. That implies that smok-
ers who live in apartments can-
not even smoke in their own 
homes. That is the case right 
now in university dormitories. 

Besides being unfair, exces-
sive restrictions on smokers are 
uneffective. When I lived in the 
Argo Hall dorms freshman year, 
my neighbors would smoke 
right outside the suites. The 
open air diluted the smoke 
immediately. The resident advi-
sors, however, were instructed to 
enforce the law of no smoking 
within 10 feet of a building. As a 
result, smokers had to descend 
five stories and walk to Revelle 
Plaza to smoke. When the 
weather was cold or rainy 
smokers just smoked in their 
rooms, and the air inside the 
suites tumed stuffy and smoky. 

Some producers of anti-
smoking commercials sink to the 

level of the very tobacco compa-
nies they critidze. Anti-smokers 
point out that tobacco compa-
nies boost their sales by selling 
an image, which is of course 
true. These companies want 
smokers to associate smoking 
with Joe Camel, the Marlboro 
Man and the Virginia Slims 
models. The people who make 
anti-smoking commercials also 
hope that easily impressionable 
people will buy into the image 
they are trying to Sell. That does 
not excuse anti-smoking com-
mercials that use animals to 
insult smokers personally. 

The producers of the lie 
detector commercial made 
another ad depictiJig teen-agers 
carrying body bags into tobacco 
companies. They withdrew it 
after television stations refused 
to air it. These producers should 
use reasoning and knowledge to 
dissuade smoking instead of 
cheap shock value. 

These shocking commercials 
do not help the public; they 
insult the public's intelligence. 
How can anyone believe that 
stuff? Do teen-agers buy into the 
image these commercials pro-
mote when their peers begin to 
smoke? No. Teen-agers might 
eventually come to see the com-
mercials that warn about the 
health risks of tobacco as a joke. 

Ask any chain-smoker and 
they will tell you that they know 
tobacco is addictive. They really 
do not need to be reminded for 
the 100th time that tobacco 
makes smokers wrinkly, sick and 
dead . Many smok r:; already 
understand the dangers of 
tobacco - they choose to enjoy 
it at the expense of their health. 
Fish monsters, chimps and body 
bags merely harass these indi-
viduals for their personal deci-
sions.If I were a smoker, I would 
be angry to see part of the 
money I paid for my cigarettes 
put to work harassing me.

Limiting Internet bandwidth is 
expected to throw a wrench in 
connection speeds, Frost 
added. He said he did not 
know the extent of the modifi-
cation but estimated that a 30-
minute download will now 
take between one and two 
hours to complete. 

UC Berkeley currently pays 
59,()()() a month to connect its

Frost said. ' 

Frost also said MP3 files take 
up an enormous amount of 
bandwidth and send university 
costs spiraling out of control. 

Frost added that students 
should either decide to limit 
music downloads - especially 
those from the popular Napster 
W~b site - or find a way to 
reimburse the university for the 
costs involved in providing 
unlimited access. 

The ·decision to restrict 
Internet bandwidth is not a 
punishment, Frost said, but a 
way to get students to prioritize 
their Internet access. 

The limited access is expect-
ed to remain a permanent poli-

Dhiraj Pradhan, formerly 

Texas A&tM's top-paid com-
puter science professor, was

pay $38,000 in restitution to 
the Texas A&tM UniverSity 
System Tuesday for 26 charges 
of theft and violation of proba-

Pradhan's probation 
stemmed from a Nov. 24, 1998, 
plea bargain in which he pled 
guilty to the charge of Abuse of 
Official Capacity for misusing 
538,000 of Texas A&M 
University System money in 
return for a sentence of five 
years probation during which 
he could repay the amount in 
monthly instafiments. 

Upon a secondary investi-

af.ter . the plea bargain, the 
Distnct Attorney's office dis-
covered that Pradhan had con-
tinued to use $8,000 of Texas 
A&tM University System 
money after his probation had

The charges of the $8,()()()

U ICEF began a global cam-
paign Wednesday against acts of 
homicidal vio lence against 
women who live in cultures 
where laws and society fail to 
protect them. 

A number of organizations are 
focusing on the issue as they meet 
in ew York for two weeks to 
assess progress five years after the 
largest international gathering of 
women - from the grass roots to 
governments - assembled in 
Beijing to share their hopes and 
grievances. They refer to the issue 
as culturally sanctioned homicide. 

"This is a violence that is 
almost sanctioned," said Carol 
Bellamy, the executive director of 
UNICEF. The campaign will 
focus on such acts as "honor 
killings," dowry deaths, female 
infanticide and acid attacks. 

In some countries, even when 
laws defending the right of men 
to use violence against women 
are repealed, the culture that cre-
ated them continues to exert a 
tremendous influence over 
behavior, these groups say. The 
ituation is worst across a swath 

of countries stretching from the 
Mediterranean to the edge of 
Southeast Asia, e pecially 

Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. 
"There's violence everywhere, 

there's gender discrimination 

Also in 1997 ... about 
300 women in one 
province in Pakistan 
were reported killed by 
relatives in the name of 
saving a family )s honor. 
everywhere," Bellamy said . "But 
South Asia - when we assign 
people there they come back rav-
ing feminists in six months." 

U. . agencies and thousands 
of 10caJ organizations from scores 
of countries have found, their 
leaders say, that the path toward 
better lives for the world's most 
oppressed women leads 
inevitably into a collision with 
laws that favor men. And they 
contend that it may explain why 
some countries never develop to 
their full potential. 

Almost all of the violent attacks 
on women are technically illegal. 
But some recent infonnation com-
piled by UNICEF, with the help of 

Research Sheds Light on 
Recovery After Extinction 

Over the pa t 500 million 
years, there have been dozens of 
epi odes of extinction on the 
p lanet, the mo t famous being the 
titanic event that wept away the 
dinosaur . Scientists have 
assumed that the time it takes for 
the living world to bounce back is 
proportional to the damage done: 
More time should be required to 
fill all 01 th earth's empty cor-
ners with newly evolved life after 
gargantuan extinctions and less 
time should be required after a 
more minor die-off. 

In an entirely unexpected find-
ing that has gotten the attention of 
both paleontologists and conserva-
tionists, researchers reported 
Thursday that it takes a long time 
to recover from these large-scale 
extinctions - around 10 million 
years - and more intriguing, the 
recovery time appears to be the 
same, whether the original destruc-
tion was one of the grander or one 
of the more minor events. 

Many biolOgists say that by 
destroying tropical forests and 
other habitats, humans are dri-

PROPS: 

ving species extinct at an acceler-
ating rate that if unchecked will 
result in one of the major extinc-
tions in the earth's history. 

An ominolls implication of the 
new research, some scientists say, 
is that humans may already or 
will soon have destroyed enough 
species that it will require a full 10 
million years for the planet to 
recover - 20 times longer than 
humans have already existed and 
longer than many scientists pre-
dict humanity itself is likely to 
persist into the future. 

Scientists say the new study 
will also prompt paleontologists 
to rethink how life evolves after 
major extinctions - events that 
have played a pivotal role in 
shaping the evolution of life. 

The study, by Or. James W. 
Kirchner, an earth scientist at the 
University of California at 
Berkeley, and Dr. Anne Weil, a 
paleobiologist at Duke 
University, appears Thursday in 
the journal Naturt.

sometimes, because the groom 
was not happy with a bride cho-

Also in 1997, according to the 
most recent available informa-
tion, about 300 women in one

India also has a version of 
"honor crimes," as young people 
from different Hindu castes, or 
caste Hindus and so-called out-
castes, may meet violence if they 
cross lines to marry. . 

Bellamy and other experts say 
that too much violent behavior is 
excused in the name of culture 
and religion.

Hu executed for 
taking bri.bes 
eo.tIIIIIed ".. ..... 1 
ReligiOUS Affairs, was sentenced 
to death in February for taking 
bribes worth more than 
$600,000. He was executed 
Wednesday after the Supreme 
People's Court rejected his 
appeal on Tuesday. 

Both the timing of the execu-
tion, just days after Zhu's 
speech, and extensive publicity 
made it clear thllt the 
Communist Party intends to 
make an example of Hu. Party 
officials are well aware that 
widespread corruption among 
officials and their families has 
seriously damaged the party's 
reputation. , 

In a country where execu-
tions are often quietly meted 
out, Hu's death - and his mis-
deeds - were featured in the 
official press and on the main 
evening news, which showed 
Hu, a small balding rnan in a 
business suit, being escorted by 
police guards. Even Daily Focus, 
China's popular investigative 
television news magazine, 
devoted its entire show to Hu's 
downfall . 

The commentary urged offi-
cials to draw lessons from the 
case and not to be "attracted by 
all sorts of temptations during 
reform and opening to the out-
side world." 

In his opening speech to the 
yearly session Bf parliament on 
Sunday, Zhu repeatedly referred 
to corruption as one of China's 
most pressing issues. 

"All major cases, no matter 
which department or who is 
involved, must be thoroughly 
investigated and corrupt offi-
cials must be severely pun-
ished," he said. 

Zhu, who is widely admired 
by Chinese as upright and hon-
est, has made the fight against 
corruption something of a per-
sonal crusade, and his anti-cor-
ruption campaign has wide pop-
ular support.

Once Inside the U.S., Illegal 
Immigrants Are Left Alone 

CHICAGO - Salvador Silva 
often used to worry that immi-
gration agents would raid the 
commercial laundry where he 
works. If they did, "* had a plan. 
He would /'ump onto a table, 
hoist hirnse f into an air-condi-
tioning duct, and hide there 
until the agents left. He prac-
ticed this more than once. 

"We lived with the uncertain-
ty of raids,"said Silva, 26, who 
has worked illegally in this coun-
try for 10 years, ever since he 
walked across a bridge from 
Juarez in Mexico to EI Paso, 
Texas, and flew to Chicago to join 
a brother. Onl,r. now is he begin-
ning to relax. For the first time," 
he said, "I don't fear the raids." 

Such raids have all but 
stopped around the country over 
the last year. In a booming econo-
my running short of labor, hun-
dreds of thousands of illegal 
immigrants are increasingly toler-
ated in the nation's workplaces. 
The Immigration and 
Naturalization Service has made 

crossing the border harder than 
ever, stepping up patrols and 
prosecuting companies that 
smuggle in aliens or blatantly 
recruit them. But once inside the 
country, illegal immigrants are 
now largely left alone. Even when 
these people are discovered, 
arrests for the purpose of depor-
tation are much less frequent; 
such arrests dropped to about 
8,600 last year from 22,000 just 
two years earlier, the INS reports. 

The INS now concentrates on 
picking up aliens who have com-
mitted crimes. The rest are, in 
effect, aUowed to help U.S. 
employers fill jobs. "It is just the 
market at work. drawing people 
to jobs. and the INS has chosen to 
concenbate its actions on aliens 
who are a ~to the rommu-
nity," said L Bach, the 
agency's associate commissioner 
for policy and planning. 

This greater acceptance of 
illegal immigrants in the work 
force helps explain why overaU 
wage increases have been less 

than many economists and poli-
cy-makers had expected, given 
an unemployment rate of only 4 
percent and a strong demand for 
people to fill jobs that pay $8 an 
hour or less, which is 25 percent 
of all jobs. Immigrants - legal 
and illegal - have fed the pool 
of people available to take these 
lower· paying jobs. 

A downturn in the booming 
economy and any resulting 
uptick in unemployment could 
spur the INS to revive its pursuit 
of illegal immigrants at work. 
Even now, some members of 
Congress, particularly Rep. 
Lamar Smith, are pushing for 
legislation that would step up 
efforts to prevent illegal immi-
grants from working in the 
United States. Certainly, the 
more open policy today stands 
in sharp contrast to the 1980s 
and even the mid-1990s, when 
unemployment was higher.

Signs Point to New 'Sensation' at Whitney 
NEW YORK - Every couple 

of years the Whitney Museum of 
American Art mounts its 
Biennial, an exhibition of new 
and often cutting-edge 
American art. 

This year, one work may be a 
little too cutting. 

"Sanitation," an installation 
by HaQS Haacke, a well-known 
German-born New York artist, 
puts Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in 
the company of the Nazis, with 
quotations by him written in the 
Fraktur script favored by the 
Third Reich and the sound of 
jackboots marching in the back-
ground. 

The artwork, which will be 
on view when the 2000 Biennial 
opens on March 23, recalls the 
fury over the First Amendment 
issues raised by the " Sensation" 
exhibition at the Brooklyn 
Museum of Art last fall when 
the mayor attacked some of the 
art work as "sick" and "disgust-

ing." 
The work by Haacke was 

rommissioned by the museum, 
which did not know ahead of 
time exactly what he would pro-
duce. . . 

Despite the deliberate intent 
to provoke the mayor and the 
public by Haacke, Maxwell L. 
Andenon, the mUleUllt's direc-
tor, said that the Whitney decid-
ed in the last few days to back 
the artist and take its chances 
with City Hall. 

"This one will hlt a nerve," I'll! 
said, "but 1 have no~ualrns 
about showing it, thou on a 
personal level I don't re the 
premise of the work, which is to 
liken various public officials to 
Nazis." 

Haacke's installation is 
planned around a wall lined 
with a row of eight to 12 
garbage cans, each with a 
speaker playing a tape of 
marching troops. On the wall 

will be a reproduction of the 
First Amendment framed in 
gold and six quotations, written 
in the Gothic typescript used by 
Hitler, from American politi-
cians. 

Three are from Giuliani and 
refer to "Sensation," which 
included a work that especial-
ly upset the mayor, it render-
ing of the Virgin Mary by 
Chris Ofili that incorporated 
pornographic cutouts and ele-
phant dung. 

The Brooklyn Museum gets 
a hefty subsidy from the city, 
and in the Haacke work one 
quotation from the mayor 
says: ·We will do everything 
that we can to remove funding 
for the Brooklyn Museum until 
the director comes to his sens-
es."

The Guardian Album Reviews 
Oasis and the Smashing Pumpkins prove their 15 minutes ofJame is not over with their newest releases 
B'/ JOIIPH LH 
Staff Writer 

The proverbial party is over 
for Oasis and their new album, 
Standing on the Shoulde of Giants, 
is the musical result. Their first 
album Definitely Maybe made a 
massive splash in the music 
industry and created much antic-
ipation for their next album 
(What's the Story) Morning Glory?, 
which made Oasis international 
stars. Their third album had lofty 
expectations and although it 
went platinum, Be Here Now was 
considered a commercial flop. 

So "what's the story" for 
Standillg on the Shoulder ofGumts? 
Oasis always seemed to be at the 
verge of splitting up. The band's 
bass player and guitarist have 
quit the band and have subse-
quently been replaced . Oasis quit 
their _record label at Creation, 
and consequently, created their 
own label, Big Brother. 

All that brouhaha coupled 
with' lead guitar Noel Gal-
lagher 's continuing battle with 
drugs create an uncharacteristic 
dark tone to the album. Oasis' 
Signature youthful optimism has 
been replaced with brooding 
lyrics. The blatant arrogance 
shown in the past by Noel and 
the rest of Oasis has dwindled. 
Consequently, that insecurity 
and inferiority complex shows 
through the music with partiru-
lareaw. 

In spite of the criticisms due 
to their similarity to The Beatles, 
Oasis were able to create a strong 
album in Stllnding with their 

maturing and expansive sound, 
which still retains their classic 
appeal. Frontman Liam Gal-
lagher's voice is still one of the 
best in business and Noel is still 
able to write haunting melodies 
with a great sing-a-long chorus. 

Standing opens with the 
instrumental track "Fuckin' in 
the Bushes" that crashes through 
your speakers with a drum loop 
and a vibrant Led Zeppelin-
esque guitar riff. Noel Gal-
lagher's work with the Chemical 
Brothers has inspired him to use 
similar production techniques 
that create an album with drum 
loops and multilayers of guitars 
and keyboards. 

"Go Let it Out" has an infec-
tious melody whose lyrics sim-
ply scream Oasis. It begins with a 
simple drum beat that~n kicks 
into that classic Oasis melody. 
The drums are qUickly accompa-
nied by a flowing acoustic guitar 
that gives way to a steady bass 
line. 

The song continues to grow 
and expand with a "Strawberry 
Fields" effect during the chorus 
as strings and a shrill whistle 
make way for Liam Gallagher's 
soaring vocals and a beautiful 
solo by Noel. 

Liam's first son§ writing ven-
ture, "Little James ' wonderfully 
utilizes a Mellotron and is a very 
touching song despite his nurs-
ery rhyme-style lyrics. 

"Gas Panic" is arguably the 
strongest track on the album. The 
track portrays the paranoia and 
confusion resulting from Noel's 
constant cocaine abuee as he 

writes, "cos your family don't 
seem so familiar and my enemies 
all know my name." Synthesized 
strings rush around in a mass of 
controlled chaos accented by a 
claustrophobic guitar solo mid-
way through the song. 

The album is a powerful effort 
by Oasis, especially with the real-
ization they have been slipping 
from the top of the music world. 
The album as a whole sounds 
great and is accented with a few 
solid radio songs that can propel 
them to the top once more. 

The Smashing Pumpkins 

know how to rock, and Maclti-
na/Machines of God - released by 
the Smashing Pumpkins on Feb. 
28 - reassures the public of this 
fact. While many critics feared 
that the Smashing Pumpkins for-
got how to entertain after the 
release of Adore, Madlina allows 
frontman Billy Corgan to prove 
his ability to blend electronica 
and rock. 

With their latest release, the 
Pumpkins show their musical 
versatility to remain in the music 
industry without "selling ou!." 
Mac/lina has the sounds of the 
Pumpkins' previous album 
Adore, but adds that tough 
grunge edge that first made the 
band popular. The album is 
soaked with wonderful melodies 
and introspective lyricS, making 
it worth listening to all the way 
through. 

As a whole, the album reflects 
the influences of The Cure and 
David Bowie, and as unlikely as 
it may seem, many tracks even 
have the anthem quality of U2 
songs. 

With Machina, Corgan shows 
that the Smashing l'umpkins 
have expanded and matured 
their sound since Adore. ThE' 
opening track "The Everlasting 
Gaze" greets the listener with a 
full and refreshing wave of 
sound. This track packi a power-
ful punch and is reminiscent of 
older Pumpkins material as Cor-
gan sneers, "You know I'm not 
dead." Asserting ihat the Smash-
ing Pumpkins are indeed ready 
to rock again. 

MHeavy Metal Machine" pum-

mels listeners with a thick wall of 
distorted guitars blended with a 
solid Pumpkins hook that 
demands attention. "Try Try Try" 
and "The Crying Tree o( Mer-
cury" are smooth and lush with 
ethereal guitars and keyboards 
that wash over Chamberlin's 
steady drumbeat. 

Chamberlin's drumming 
stands out most in the anthem-
like progressive rock song "Glass 
and the Ghost Children," which 
brings back the sense of mystery 
and drama that was evident in 
the epic Mellon Collie a"d the Infi-
nite Sadness. Chamberlin refills 
the void that was felt before in 
the Pumpkins' previous albums. 
Although "Glass and the Ghost 
Children" carries on for nearly 10 
minutes, the sweeping move-
ments of rich guitars and scat-
tered drum riffs . It is interrupted 
by what seems to be an interview 
with Billy Corgan, and then 
"Glass" floats back into another 
section of the song that is equally 
as beautiful, with soft, electronic

Do You Agree With Death Metal? 
Interviews with God Dethroned's frontman Henri Sattler and Cannibal Corpses George 'Corpsegrinder' Fisher 
By TALAII PARUNYAN 
Staff Writer 

Death metal bands God 
Dethroned and Cannibal Corpse 
are touring the states to promote 
their latest albums, Bloody Blas-
phemy and Bloodthirst, respective-
ly. The show, which played in 
Los Angeles' coveted Whiskey 
A-Go-Go, was more packed than 
a free UCSD rave. People in the 
audience were literally sticking 
to each other and fans had to 
hold their heads above the 
crowd to get a single breath 'of 
air. The bands sounded amazing 
live, tearing up the stage with 
killer guitar riffs, orgasmic dou-
ble bass drumming and brutal 
vocals. 

Many genres of metal exist, 
ranging from death, black, thrash, 
heavy and power. God 
Dethroned, as Holland's gift to 
America, questionably verges on 
black ~nd death metal. Lead 
growler Henri Sattler cleared the 
confusion. 

"We're definitely a death 
metal band," Sattler said. "We 
have some black metal, heavy 

metal and thrash influences, but 
we're a death metal band." With 
influences such as Iron Maiden, 
Slayer, At the Gates and Emperor, 
this band can't go wrong. 

Flailing his Heineken beer bot-
tle, SattIer commented on the dif-
ference of American brutality in 
the mosh pits compared to their 
European counterparts. 

"It's better in the states," Sat-
tler said. "Holland is too laid 
back. They smoke too much pot." 

The cover art of God 
Dethroned's albums is symbolic 
of what the band believes; its lat-
est album, Bloody Blasphemy, is 
covered with demons attacking a 
crucifix with Christ still on it. 

Sattler denied that the band 
has any religious affiliations. 

"We're against all religion," 
Sattler said . "I think the Bible is a 
book of stories. It's just an opin-
ion and not a law, and you can 
think or say about it whatever 
you want ... and that's what we 
do. I don't get the people in the 
States, Why are they so scared of 
bands like us?" 

One-time presidential candi-
date Bob Dole affectionately held 

Cannibal Corpse responsible for 
the lack of morality in American 
society. Cannibal Corpse has been 

banned from playing in Australia, 
New Zealand and Korea and in 
Germany, the band is forbidden 
to perform live material from its 
first three albums. 

"The kids pay money to come 
see the show," lead singer 
George 'Corpsegrinder' Fisher 
said, "and 1 hope they want to 
hear the new songs, but we're 
not a band that's going to play 
all the new songs, because the 
fans want to see [the old songs] 
- and our fans are the number 
one thing for the band." 

Fisher continued to wallow in 
the idea that his fans can't hear 
the music they want to due to 
censorship. 

"We're proud of our past," 
Fisher said. "Other bands change 
their style and ignore their past. I 
didn't sing on those [first) 
albums, but 1 was a fan of the 
band before I got hired. So, there 
you go. We're not going to make 
those mistakes." 

Fisher recently got to sing 
alongSide one of his favorite 
bands, The Misfits, while touring 
with them. 

"[The Misfits') new album is

great," Fisher said. "I love Jerry 
Only. He's a really nice guy and 
that was one of my favorite 
tours." 

Death metal bands and their 
musicians don't get the coverage 
they deserve. Pubescent boy 
bands run the airwaves while 
Metallica is producing lemons. 

"Alex, our bass 'player, was 
voted one of the bassists of the 
year in a British magazine called 
Terrorizer," Cannibal Corpse 
drummer Paul Mazurkiewicz 
said while warming up. "At least 
he gets recognition in 'England. I 
mean, it's picking up a bit. We 
just keep plugging away, doing 
what we do and we're making it 
without all the publicity and 
recognition mainstream maga-
zines have to offer. We just take it 
as it comes." 

Surely the number of God 
Dethroned and Cannibal Corpse 
fans running around UCSD are 
slim to none, but as the Corpseg-
rinder himself put it, "Heavy 
metal fans are the fucking best!" 
Specilll thanks to Bob Gilmore of 
Metal Blade for milking the inter-
view possible.

The Smashing Pumpkins are

Their growth and maturity is 
evident with Machina's electronic 
noises and steady, yet energetic,

CIta".d ~ The "Art of the LowrIder· Is showing at the Automotive Museum in 
Balboa Part< through March 26. 

LOWRIDER: 
Culture and community are 
key component in identity 

brushed murals of beautiful Latina 
women. 

Another prominent member of the Ami-
gos who has a car on display at the" Art of 
the Lowrider" is Rigo Reyes, a cherubic 
Latino man with over two decades of expe-
rience in the low rider community. Rigo is 
the owner of "La Cucaracha," an antique 
1929 Willys-Knight automobile converted 
into a breathtaking lowrider. His beautiful 
car is dedicated to a female icon of the Mex-
ican Revolution, known to the Latino com-
munityas La Cucaracha. The green low rid-
er bears an airbrushed mural with depic-
tions of such heroes as La Cucarcha, Che 
Guevera and Emiliano Zapata, symboliz-

. 

ing cultural pride and community 
activism. 

Like other lowrider owners, Rigo 
Reyes emphasizes the important link 
between family, community and lowrider 
culture. He founded the San Diego 
LoWrider Council 25 years-ago and is still 
active in the community. 

"The important thing is the link 
between culture and the community," said 
Reyes. "Those are the two pillars of the 
Mexican-American community: la cultura 
and la familia. The low rider is a part of 
that." 

The ,.. Art of the Lowrider" shows at 
the Automotive Museum through March 
26. It is open daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
Admission is $7 for adults, $6 for seniors 
65 or older and active military, $3 for

leaps and bounds as a player this year. He is 
much better in 90 many dimensions. His 
defense has blossomed under Jackson's 
tutelage. His passing has improved. His 
shot range has expanded from dunk, dunk. 
dunk to an assortment of shots. To top it all 
off, he has been hitting some of his foul 
shots lately. 

As of Tuesday night, Shaq was No.2 in 
scoring average with 28.2 points a game to 
Iverson's 29.7 average. Shaq is second in 
rebounds with 14.3 a gam~ to Dikembe 
Mutumbo's 14.7. O'Neal is third in blocks 
with an average of 3.7 a game, third to 
Mourning'sO 4.0 and Mutumbo's 3.5. Shaq 
leads the league in field goal percentage at 
.565 and even averages 3.8 assists a game, 
very good for a big man. 

Shaq proved his point Monday night 
when he celebrated his 28th birthday 'by

Shaq also added 23 rebounds. Finally, amaz-
ingly, Shaq went 13-22 from the line. That is

Shaq can easily score 50 points a night

score 100 against the ~ of the league

Chicago if he set out to do so, but he does-

Shaq wants to do and that is win champi-

Corner Volleyball Comes Up Short 
Robert FuHon 

Shaquille O'Neal is 
NBA's Most Valuable 

Everybody repeat after me. 
Shaquille O'Neal is the NBNs 
Most Valuable Player. 

That's right, the man with a 
Superman tattoo is the 
league's MVP by far this year. 

Who else is there? Well? 
Allen Iverson? Puh-leeze, the 
man can score when he takes 
35 shots a game and has the 
76ers set for another playoff 
appearance, but he is no 
league MVP. 

Tim Duncan, you say? He's 
a great player, arguably the 
best playing right now, but 
injuries and San Antonio's 
good but not great year puts 
him out of the running. He 
should have been MVP last 
year, but he was robbed. 

Grant Hill? Karl Malone? 
Alonzo Mourning? Nope. 
None of them can eclipse the 
large shadow thai the big man 
O'Neal casts. 

Shaq is the MVP of Ihe 
NBA by such a wide margin, it 
isn' t even funny. Without him, 
the league would be in even 
more disa rray than it already 
is. 

Shaq Daddy is the Lakers. 
Withou t Shaq, the Lakers 
would be a fai r or maybe a 
good team. With him, they are 
a great team. Kobe Bryant is a 
good player and extremely tal-
ented. He has picked up his 
defense th is year under Phil 
Jackson, and is maturing on 
the offensive end. I look for 
him to receive a few trophies 
later in his career, but the 
Lakers would not be nearly as 
affected if they lost him as they 
would be if they loss Shaq 
Steel. 

The Lakers are Shaq's team, 
no matter how you look at it. 
With Shaq in L.A., the Lakers 
are the best team in the NBA. 
There is some talk from others 
in the GuardiRn sports depart-
ment that Portland is the most 
talented, but it is the Lakers 
who have the best record and 
who are currently on a 16-
game winning streak as of 
Tuesc:b:; night. 

Because of L.A:s success, 
Shaq and his crew are on NBC 
practically every weekend, 
sometimes twice a weekend. 

Commissioner David Stem 
needs Shaq and the Lakers like 
you wouldn't believe. TV rat-
ings have plummeted since 
the retirement of Michael 
Jordan. The NBA needs some-
thing to sell. Shaq and the 
Lakers are the best product out 
there. 

Vince Carter is exciting to 
watch and the most entertain-
ing player to gaze upon, but 
he's all the way up in Canada 
and still has a long way to 
grow as a player. Shaq and the 
others sporting purple and 
gold are in the nation's sec-
ond-largest TV market. 
Without Shaquille dominating 
in the megalopolis of L.A. on 
national television every 
weekend, the NBA's pathetic 
ratings would be even lower. 

Shaq has improved by

ALMOST: Tritons almost beat No,-14 ranked Loyola Marymount, but fall 15-10, 15-5, 15-12 
By BRIAN WELLES 
Associate Sports Editor 

Facing the Division I No. 14-
ranked team in the nation last 
Tuesday night at home, the men's 
volleyball team was in for anoth-
er big challenge. 

The flip side was that the 
match presented yet another 
opportunity for improvement 
going into next week's match ver-
sus Division III Vassar College. 

From the standpoint of perfor-
mance, UCSD capitalized on its 
chance to work on its overall 
game, even though the 
scoreboard was 
not indicative of 
success for the 

. Tritons. UCSD 
lost the match 
15-10, 15-5, 15-12 against 
Loyola Marymount 
University in spite of giving LMU 
a solid run for its money in two 
out of the three garnes. 

Unfortunately, moral victories 
and noble efforts don't count for 
100 much in the NCAA rankings, 
and UCSD has learned this the 
hard way all season long. 

"Nearly every match we play, 
we're playing top-ranked teams 
in the country and thai puts us at 
a disadvantage," Head Coach 
Ron Larsen said . 

Staying true to Larsen's 
words, LMU played excellently in 
terms of ball mobility and setting 
up hitters for sideout kills and 
points. This fact reared its ugly 
head many times during the 
match, and five players for LMU 
scored in the double digits. The 
team as a whole also recorded 20 
more kills than the Triton squad. 

UCSD didn't really gets its 
offense rolling until the third 
games when Donald Chen lit up 
tne LMU court with great shots. 
"I thought Donald played 
absolutely fabulous for us," 
Larsen said. "He was on fire." 

Jordan Hove made much of 
Chen's solid play possible when 
he came in off the bench in this 
game and set the volleyball in the 
right places. 

"Jordan did a good job of see-
ing that other hitters were not 
contributing," Larsen said. 

Hove adjusted to the lack of 
offensive ability that his team-
mates were showing in game 
three by setting the volleyball in 
the direction of opposite Donald 
Chen. Game three was a battle 
between the two teams, but 
UCSD, like in its second game 
versus Pepperdine last Saturday 
night, could not nail down its 
opponent at all. 

"The people we brouitht in did 
not contribute offensivefy outside 
of Chen," Larsen said about the 
third game. 

LMU had better blocking 
than what the Tritons saw 

against 
Pepperdine, 
and UCSD 
failed to 
counter the 

attack. Jordan Hove pro-
vided the exception and the 

setter who turned in a great per-
formance at his position during 
the game also contributed seven 

. digs to the Triton cause. 
The Tritons threatened top-

ranked LMU in the first game 
when the score was knotted at 
eight. UCSD then proceeded to 
hit a service error, two service 
errors, followed by an overpass. 

All of a sudden, the team was 
down 12-8. Prom there on out, 
LMU played at a high level and 
continued its dominance over the 
tempo of the match through the 
second game. LMU's stifling of 
UCSD in game two also resulted 
from the Tritons' own lack of inten-
sity. The Triton team had its weak-
est attack in this segment of the 
game with only 10 kills total, as 
opposed to the 25 and 28 it scored 
in games one and two respectively. 

Earnest Yun had 11 kills for 
UCSD, but Donald Chen was the 
man with a whopping 32 kills, 
and his hitting percentage was 
.400 out of 60 attempts at the vol-
leyball. Zack Hlte recorded seven 
kills and Mortimer had six. 

RIMAC Arena next Tuesday 
night. "Vassar, us and other teams 
are all working for large berths in 
.the final four of Division UI," 

. Larsen said. "We'll be looking to 
come in and establish that we're 
the number one Division III team 
in the country."

Track Team Has Good Showing Against D-I Foes 
FAST: Triton women finish second, men third in a meet against fellow UC schools 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD track and field 
team went and competed with 
the big boys this past Saturday 
at the UC Championships in 
Irvine. 

The competition featured four 
Division I tearns to go with the 
Division III Tritons. 

It is safe to say that UCSD held 
its own against a much stiff com-
petition. 

"Both [the men's and 
women's] teams did extremely 
well," Triton Head Coach Tony 
Salerno said. "They are all 
Division I teams. We were the 
only DivBion III school. I'm real-
ly proud with the way we com-
peted." 

For UCSD's women's team 
finished second with a score of 
231 and took four first-place fin-

ishes. 
The host team, Irvine, finished 

first with 255 points, Santa 
Barbara took third with a 194.5, 
juggernaut UCLA grabbed fourth 
WIth a score of 141 and a measly 
46 points gave Riverside fifth 
place. 

The UCSD men's team 
did not fare quite as well. 
It garnered only two 
first-place finishes 
but did take third 
place with a score of 
181. 

Santa Barbara was first 
with 230, UCLA placed sec-
ond with 2~, host tearn irvine 
finished fourth with 163 and 111 
points gave Riverside another 
fifth-place finish. 

"We've been pretty successful 
for a while playing above our 
division," Salerno said. "We can 
hang pretty well. We raise our 

level of expectations." 
The Tritons' Jessica Shugart 

had a big day on the track. 
"She was tremendous," 

Salerno said. "She's an amazing 
athlete." 

The senior finished first in 
the 100-meter dash with a 
time of 12.79 seconds. She 
also anchored the win-

ning 4 x 100-meter 
relay team that took 
the top spot with a 
time of 49.62 sec-
onds and she ran 

the anchor leg in the 
Tritons' second-place finish 

in the 4 x 400-meter relay team 
that sped to a time of 3:59.26. 

"One of the best moments of 
the meet came in the 400," 
Salerno said. "She was about five 
meters back [from UCLA's 
anchor] and she just ran her 
down." 

There were a number of other 
top women finishers for the 
Tritons. 

Senior Anne Moore leapt 37 
feet, 7-3/4 inches to take the triple 
jump competition. Additionally, 
her distance qualified her for the 
NCAA Division III National 
Championships and it places her 
at No. 5 for aU time in the Triton 
record books. 

UCSD's Erin Selim grabbed 
second in the 800-meter run in a 
time of 2:17.74. That time is a sea-
son best for the sophomore and 
places her in the No. 6 spot all 
time for UCSD. 

Catherine Nolan's powerful 
anns launched the javelin throw 
for 122 feet 2 inches to take sec-
ond place in the meet. The dis-
tance solidifies her hold of second 
place in the Triton record books.
