Nader Visits UCSD to Talk Energy 
Former presidential candidate 
addresses California crisis 
By ANDREW QUADRI 
Staff Writer 

In the midst of a power crisis, there was 110 
shortage of energy in the Price Center Ballroom 
on Thursday, March 23. Bu t some peoplt: 
brought flashlights just in case. 

early 1,000 people filled the ballroom to 
hear Ralph Nader speak about California's 
power crisis. Former U.S. Senate candidate 
Medea Benjamin, Texa n radio host Jim 
Hightower and local environmental journalist 
Robert Nanninga also spoke at the event. 

California's electric ut ilities have lost mill ions 
of dollars in the las t yea r. Their financia l trouble 
made "roll ing blackouts," once industry ja rgon, a 
household word in Cali fo rn ia. 

ader and other Green advocates want the 
state either to readopt cost-based regulation or 
to take over the state's electrical grid. "There is 
no reason why electricity should be subjected to 
corporate price manipulation," Nader said. 

Cost-based regulation would require utilities 
to charge consumers the price of gencrating their 
electricity plus a small, set profit. 

Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas 
& Electric welcomed deregulation and thoughl 
they would become international energy compa-
nies. Their parent companies, Edi son 
International and PG& E Corp., bought prof-
itable holdings in other parts of tht: United 
States and the world, but have been beat at horne 
by bigger companies from out of state, and arc 
begging for their second consumer bailout in 
four years. 

When deregulation took effect, the two utili-
ties had incentive to sell their fossil fuel plants. 
Most of the plants were sold for Illore than mar-
ket va lue to corporations such as Texas-based 
Dynegy, Inc. and North Carolina-based Dukc 
Energy.

Chancellor Gives .. State-o,f-the-Campus Address 
Two talks given in effort to increase communication within the campus community 
By VINCENT GRAGNANI 
Senior Staff Writer 

In an effort to increase commu-
nication with the campus commu-
nity, Chancellor Robert C. Dynes 
discussed campus growth issues 
last Friday at the-Hillcrest Medical 
Center. Dynes gave a similar 
speech on the La Jolla campus on 
March 22. 

Over the next decade, UCSD 
will grow by approximately 
10,000 students and 450 faculty 
members. This growth is due to 
state mandates which require the 
UC system to serve the top 12.5 
percent of graduating high school 
seniors and maintain an 18.7 -to-
1 student-to-faculty ratio. The 
UC system as a whole will take on 
60,000 studen!~ over the next 10 
years. 

"' know a lot of people have 
mixed feelings about this; Dynes 

said. "1 know 1 have mixed feelings 
about this. Sometimes it terrifies 
me. But sometimes 1 lie awake at 
night and my mind races thinking 
of all the possibilities. 

"' can't say it's going to be 
wonderful," he continued. "But 1 
can say it will be inevitable." 

Dynes said UCSD plans to 
open a new school of pharmacy, 
which will accept its first incoming 
class in September of 2002. The 
school will eventually be housed in 
a 75,000 square-foot building that 
will be completed in 2005. 

Dynes stressed the fact that the 
campus, as a public university, 
needs to serve the community as a 
whole. 

"It isn't just our campus -
UCSD belongs to the citizens' of 
San Diego and the citizens of 
California; he said. "It's their 
campus as well." 

The ,La Jolla and Hillcrest 

medical centers, the new John 
and Becky Moores Cancer 
Center, and a world-class child 
care faci lity are ways in which 
UCSD has and will reach out to 
the community. 

Dynes pointed out that UCSD 
teams also helped in the recent 
S:lI1tan:l and Granite Hills high 
school shootings. 

Dozens of union members, 
elad in green T-shirts, called 
upon Dynes during the question -
and-answer period to address 
staff issues such as the lack of pay 
raises and a shortage of employ-
ees. 

Dynes said that he has already 
set up' a committee to look into 
issues of staff expansion. 

"Yes, we are going to hire new 
staff, of course we are," he said. 
"But we don't know how and 
where we are going to do that. 

"' have appointed a committee 

to work on these figures," he 
added . "I have said to this commit-
tee, ' I don't want a series of recom-
mendations, I want changes.'" 

When members of the audi-
ence pressed Dynes to include 
staff members on this committee, 
he said that the committee · would 
set up focus groups consisting of 
staff members so that it can prop-
erly understand and address the 
issues facing UCSD staff. 

To continue the di alogue 
begun by these state-of the campus 
addresses, Dynes has set up an 
Office of the Chancellor Web site. 

Part of the Web site will show 
letters sent to the chancellor via e-
mail. 

"' cannot respond to every 
one; he said . "But 1 assure you 
that 1 read every one and [ learn 
something from every one."

4 OPINION The UCSD Guardian Monday. April 2, 2001 

Many Californians had high expectations· WMn th9' elected Gray 
Davis to the governor's seat; he has yet to live up to them 

Contributing Opinion Writer 

He's been talked up on the national scene, 
wooed by special interests and corporations, and 
achieved wild successes in fundraising - raising a 
stunning $37,000 per day since he took office in 
1998, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune. 
Gov. Gray Davis, elected in an impressive victory 
three years ago, was widely hailed as just what the 
doctor ordered after former Republican Gov. Pete 
Wilson left office. 

However, since those optimistic days, the eco-
nomic and political climate here in California has 
soured, and the downturn has taken Davis' popu-

ment for admission, it is clear that the ability of 
standardized tests to accurately measure student 
achievement is limited at best and should only be 
considered in conjunction with a wide variety of 
other criteria. Davis' claim that standardized tests 
will light the way toward a better educational 
future for California's children is clearly flawed. 

Davis uses these tests to determine which 
schools should receive bonuses based on demon-
strated improvement, meaning increasing test 
scores. However, while this may seem to be a good 
incentive to encourage schools to shape their kids 
up, this is clearly flawed. Such a program suggests 
that school administrators and teachers are some-
how slacking off, and all they need is to have a 

larity in a tailspin with it. The 
challenges Davis now faces, in 
terms of education, leadership, 
and the ever-looming energy 
crisis, have shown his true col-
ors. Despite his above-average 
public relations and fundrais-
ing, Davis has been revealed as 
no more than your average self-
interested politician, with a 
below-average knack for man-
aging our complex state. 

Davis has done nothing 
monetary carrot dangled in 
front of them in order to mys-
teriously improve student 
achievement. This is insulting 
and certainly not the case. 
Schools whose students score 
poorly on standardized tests 
are not failing due to lazy fac-
ulty and staff, but due to lack 
of funding and the socioeco-
nomic base of the surround-
ing neighborhoods. Giving 
funding to schools that per-
form well is an example of the 
backward thinking character-

During Davis' election cam-
paign in 1998, he touted himself 
as a reform candidate, ready to 
step into the governor's seat and 
address the myriad of problems

problems at work here. 
Instead, he has 
implemented a largely . 
worthless and incredibry 
costly standardized testing 
system that wastes ... 
class time. 

that have always plagued California. A major ele-
ment of his platform was education. Obviously, 
California's public education system needs a shot 
in the arm: We lag n~r the bottom of national 
rankings for test scores and other barometers of 
student achievement. 

Davis has done nothing to address the under-
lying problems at work here. Instead, he has imple-
mented a largely worthless and incredibly . costly 
standardized testing system that wastes teachers' 
and students' class time. Instead of learning the 
fundamentals, they spend days reviewing test-tak-
ing techniques. With the University of California's 
recent steps toward eliminating the SAT I require-

istic of Davis. 
The issue on most Califor-

nians' minds currently, of course, is the energy cri-
sis. Power service is sporadically interrupted, rates 
are skyrocketing, and blame is being placed on 
anyone and everyone. Clearly there are no easy 
solutions to be found. What is necessary to get on 
the right track, however, is an end to the politick-
ing and finger-pointing, and mature, thoughtful 
leadership to guide us through the inevitably 
painful process of keeping the lights on. 

As governor, Davis would be the man to do 
this, one would think. Unfortunately, he has 
repeatedly shown himself to be unwilling to step

U]S's Decision to Pull Out of Forum is Disappointing 
The refusal to have a concilliatory meeting prompts the question: What is there to hide? 
By NOUR CHAMMAI 
SpeCial to the Guardian 

As a result of the recent con-
troversy over Anti-Zionism Week, 
and in an attempt to educate the 
UCSD student body on this 
important issue, the A.S. external 
office recently made an avid effort 
to organize a forum in which four 
speakers - two representing the 
Palestinian side and two repre-
senting the Jewish side - would 
be invited to shed light on this 
topic. We, the members of the 
Arab Student Union, and the 
American-Arab Anti-Discrimina-

tion Committee, strongly sup-
ported the event and were very 
excited about presenting our case 
to the public. 

This academic forum was to 
address the origins and the reasons 
of the conflict, the topics of which 
would include the historical aspect, 
matters relevant to human rights 
and international law, and 
prospects for the future. Unfortu-
nately, we were saddened to see the 
Union of Jewish Students pull out 
their speakers, who were urged by 
the Jewish community at large to 
boycott the forum. Thus, the 
underlying question that I ask and 

attempt to answer is: What is there 
to hide? . 

As the issue of Zionism has 
recently been responsible for stir-
ring a~ emotional controversy on 
this campus, it is important that the 
legitimacy and validity of its claim 
be examined, with the hope that 
the reasons for our vehement 
opposition to this political ideology 
are wholly clarified. 

In 1919, at the Peace Confer-
ence in Paris, the Zionist Organi-
zation advanced its claim to Pales-
tine, suggesting that the Allied 
Powers should "recognize the his-
toric title to Palestine and the right 

of the Jews to reconstitute in 
Palestine, their national home.· 
This claim, as my study will prove, 
has no basis in fact or in law. 

From an historical viewpoint, 
the Zionist claim of a legitimate 
Jewish right to Palestine fans short 
for two reasons. First, the Jews are 
neither the original nor the longest 
continuous inhabitants of Pales-
tine. Palestine's earliest known 
inhabitants were the Canaanites, 
who are thought to have inhabited 
the country as early as 3000 B.C. In 
fact, the Jebusites, a Canaanite 
subgroup, built the city of 
Jerusalem over a thousand years 

before the Israelites first appeared 
on the land. 

Furthermore, the sum of all 
the periods of rule that Jewish 
groups had on this 'land, which 
adds up to no more than 300 
years, is short relative to this 
region's long history of over 5,000 
years. Moreover, following the 
destruction of the Temple by 
Titus in A.D. 70, Jerusalem, as 
argued by Albert M. Hyamson, 
"never again revived as a Jewish 
city,· and the Jews, who were 
either killed or deponed, almost

Students Need to Broaden Horizons Shy Guys Do Not 
Need to Apply 

Jaded & 
Faded 

CAROLINE SONG 

A ll right all you smart-ass UCSD students, finals are over, and I have a 
pop quiz for you: 

1. Where is the Eiffel Tower 
located? 

2. What language is predomi-
nantly spoken in Australia? 

3. Is homosexuality very com-
mon in Greece? 

4. What language is spoken 
by the Taiwanese? 

5. How is Brazil different from 
other South American coun-
tries? 

6. What are the people of 
Denmark called? 

7. What language is spoken in 
The Netherlands? 

It. Name the countries that 
comprise Scandinavia. 

9. In what country is Mount 
Kilimanjaro located? OK fine, in 
what continent? 

10. Where is Ceylon? What is 
Ceylon? Who is Ceylon? Is Cey-
lon a person, place, or thing? 

The average Al1'lerican would 
not know the correct answers 
even to half these questions. But 
you, the brilliant UCSD stu-
dent, you who graduated in the 
top 10 percent of your high. 
school class, you who are poised 
for greatness - the kind of 

. greatness that can only be mea-
sured by your stratospheric 
MCAT score and the kick-ass 

Beemer you will purchase once 
you finish medical school -
you f--ing brilliant SOB, you ... 
how many questions did you 
answer correctly? (Don't worry, 
the answers are in the back of 
the book - in this case, the end 
of the column - because I 
would never dream of deviating 
from the familiar format of your 
calculus textbook.) 

'[his year I have the priv-
iledge of living in UCSD's Inter-
national House. Never heard of 
it? Didn 't know we had one? It's 
located in the Pepper Canyon 
apartments. It's pretty cool; 
come check it out. In the course 
of my conversations with inter-
national students, I've come 
across some stories that have 
made me ashamed to call myself 

.an American. 
A girl from London received 

the comment "You must see the 
Eiffel Tower a lot." A Japanese 
girl was asked if Japan was part of 
China. After telling an American 
student that she was from The 
Netherlands, a Dutch student 
was asked, "Oh, that's near Ams-
terdam, right?" An Australian 
girl was asked, not once but t~ree 
times, if she came to the Untted 
States to learn English! 

Through my own travels I 
have come to realize that the rest 
of the world thinks Americans 
are morons. I'm starting to agree. 
To be fair, Americans are not 
inherently stupid; they're only 
ignorant when it comes to mat-
ters that don't pertain to their 
known universe - meaning the 
50 states. 

What's that? Dost thou 
protest? Those are the unedu-
cated masses, you say? Surely 

UCSD students, the elite of the 
intellectual world, cannot be 
Limped into the same category of 
ignoramuses. Perhaps, but per-
haps not. I used to be impressed 
with people who had a 1450 SAT 
score to their credit. But so what 
if you entered UCSD with 
enough AP transfer units to 
make you a sophomore? So what 
if you passed Math 20F with an 
A your freshman year? You're a 
dime a dozen l1ere at UCSD. You 
can tell me the answer to R = 
P/2L In 1'0 / ri , but can you tell 
me which country Greenland 
belongs to? 

It is not my intention to 
belittle the academic achieve-
ments of those who have 
worked hard in school. (Well, 
perhaps it is, but don 't take me 
too seriously.) Most of us who 
have made it thus far were 
raised in environments in which 
we were encouraged to study 
hard and to succeed academi-
cally. One may place the blame 
on our public school curricu-
lum, which does not focus 
enough on geography and the 
cu ltures of other countries. One 
may point out that the rigors of 
attending UCSD leave us little 
time to explore the cultures and 
countries outside the United 
States. Alas, what is a culturally 
challenged UCSD student to 
do? 

My answer: Get your nose 
out of your O-chem textbook 
and head down to the Interna-
tional Center (it's located on 
Library Walk, across from Cen-
ter Hall). Look into going to 
study abroad. You can go abroad

A look at the dating throughout history 
and why shy guys can't get a date 
By JOSH CROUSE

My name is Josh . I'm a nice guy

You want stats? Fine. I'm tall (6

myself in the newspaper (I hawn't 
taken a personal out yet. That ' 
where I draw the line). 

There is a simple answer. I\:oth-
ing serious or complex. I'm JUS t 
shy. The sad truth is that it is near-
ly impossible for a shy guy to get a 
date in our society. 

Taking a brief glance through 
history shows that this is the 
absolute worst time for a shy guy to 
be single and looking for a date.

evening for two. 

Brute strength

E-.:entually, I'm going tQ become

the forefront in most people's 
minds. For the most part, women 
didn't figure into the dating equa-

shirking his responsibility and pro-

California is a difficult state to

years of under-funding in schools 
have left our children ill-prepared

In the not-so-distant past,

Women were expected to be subser-

expecting the girl to agree. Believe it 
or not, girls can make their own 
decisions now and don't necessarily 
want their parents picking out dates 
for them. 

What option does that leave the 
shy guy? Simply walk up to a girl 
and ask her out? That's absurd! No 
human being should have to 
endure the excrutiating agony that 
is the few seconds between asking 
someone out and their reply. Per-
sonally, I can't stand those 
moments. Don't even get me start-
ed on dealing with rejection .... 

One might think that we have 
progressed into an era where 

women would start strong-willed and 
assertive enough 
even to approach a 
girl would get a date 
because she was 
expected to accept. 

No human being 
should have to 
endure the

for dates. That does 
happen, but only 
about as often as 
Bill Clinton shags 
Hillary (you 
guessed it, almost 
never) .

guys do have trou-
ble approaching 
girls in the first 
place, but it's a lot 
easit;r when you're 
pretty much 
assured that the girl 
will say yes. 

This brings us 
to present day, the 
worst time to be a 
shy guy looking for 
a date. 

Now that 
women have 
become assertive 
and have earned the 

excrutiating agony 
that is the few 
seconds between 
asking someone out 
and their rep ly. 
Personally, I can't 
stand those moments. 
Don't even get me 
started on c!ea1ing

The truth is that 
shy guys are stuck 
in a transitional 
limbo at the 
moment. We may 
soon be in the era 
where women do 
approach men for 
dates, but that is 
still in the future. 

I still don't have 
a date. I'm still shy. 
I'm still not desper-
ate enough to take 

recognition that th~ are people as 
well, men have lost their edge. No 
longer can a guy simply club a girl 
over the head and tl)' to drag her off. 
If he did, he'd either end up getting 
his ass kicked or thrown in jail. A 
guy also can't simply try to bribe a 
girl 's father. She'd probably steal the 
money and disown her father before 
going out with a guy like that. Guys 
can also forget about respectfully 
asking the parents for the date and

Henry Cattan,. -in his book 
Palestine and; International Law, 
states the following: "Benjamin of 
Tudela, aJewish pilgrim who visit-

1170 to 1171, found only 1,440 
Jews in all Palestine; and Nahman

two Jewish families in Jerusalem." 
On the other hand, the Palestini-

did not come into Palestine with 
the Muslim Arab invasion, as is

tion through a process of vio- ' 
lence, including some of the most 
gruesome massacres, such as that 
committed in Deir Yasin . Nine-
teen years later, in 1967, Israel 
expanded its borders as it occu-
pied the regions of Jerusalem, the 
West Bank, and Gaza, again caus-
ing the flight of Palestinian civil-
ians, exacerbating the refugee 
problem. 

Since its creation, Israel has fol-
lowed a consistent policy of land 
dispossession, house demolition 
and settlement building. In addi-
tion, its brutal occupation has 

in~luded acts of murder, rape, tor-
ture and maiming of civilians. 

For this reason, although many 
find it hard to comprehend, the 
Palestinians find little pleasure liv-
ing under Zionist occupation, and 
it is on these facts that we base our 
opposition to Zionism. Our posi-
tion on this issue, along with our 
continued struggle for justice, is 
not based on hatred for anyone, 
but rather on love for our people, 
as well as our deep and genuine 
belief in human rights. In accor-
dance with this position, we declare 
that the right to struggle is the right 
to advance, and thus, we shall never 
surrender this right to those who, 
on the one hand, preach to us 
about peace, and, on the other 
hand, prepare for war.

Costs Often Higher for the Uninsured 

When pa tients go to Dr. 
Stephen Brenner, an internal 
medicine specialist, for a routine 
exam, their bills can vary by 4S 
percent. The uninsured pay the 
most and patients with insurance 
plans are charged the least. 

It is not his doing, said 
Brenner, who practices in ew 
Haven, Conn. He explains that it 
is because health insurance' 
companies insist on hefry dis-
counts. 

"It's a take it or leave it siwa-
lIOIl for doctors," Brenner said. 
But he said he knew that the 
1I1sun:d paid much less than their 
sharc. For the insured , he sa id, 
"\l'S ,tlmost like gctting a BMW or 
:-. krccdcs ,It ha lf price."

lltlCl'. 

"It's horribly ironic," said Paul 
Menzel, a professor of philosophy 
at Pacific Lutheran University in 
Tacoma, Wash . The care of the 
poor once was supported by the 
bills paid by the wealthy and the 
Insured, but now the opposite is 
happening, he said. 

"It is the people who are most 
provided for, not the people who 
are least provided for, who get the 
benefit of cost-shifting," Menzel 
said. 

Doctors and hospital admin-
istrators say the problem crept 
up on them after they began 
agreeing to slash their prices for 
heal th insurance companies and

health maintenance organiza-
tions in return for a steady flow 
of patients. Then they found 
themselves scrambling to main-
tain their cash flow. 

They found an answer with 
patients outside the managed 
care system, like those with fee-
for-se rvice plans in 'which the 
patients pay their own bi lls and 
are reimbursed by an insurance 
company. But the uninsured also 
are outside the system, and have 

no one to negotiate for them. So 
they end up charged the higher 
prices, too - often with devas-
tating results. 

"ff you're a partner in a law 
firm, you can afford to pay more 
than your legal secretary can," 
said Dr. Darcy Hansen, an 
internist , in private practice in 
Washington. "But," she said, "it's 
the uninsured who really falter." 

Now, she said, with fewer and 
fewer patients who pay the full 
rates, she has no choice but to 
keep prices for those patients 
high. Her take-home income, she 
said, is half of what it was two or 
three years ago. 

James D. Shelton, the chair-
man and chief executive of Triad 
Hospitals Inc., a chain of for-prof-
it hospita ls and surgery centers, 
said he knew the uninsured had 
been .victims, but what are hospi-
tals supposed to do? 

"There's a limit to what these 
people can pay," Shelton said . 
"But what is the greater good - if 
the hospital goes bankrupt and it's 
the only provider in the commu-
nity or if you try to collect every 
bill you can within reason and the 
person goes bankrupt?"

New Chapter in Serbia to be Written . 
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -

The arrest of Siobodan Milosevic 
early on Sunday closes one cycle 
of Balkan history and opens, only 
now, the possibility of a consid-
ered debate in Serbia about his 
role in the wars that devastated 
the former Yugoslavia and horri-
fied the world. 

Having threatened to kill him-
self and his family rather than go 
to prison, Milosevic went com par-
ativP.iy quietly in the end, his sur-
render broken only by a few gun-
shots fired wildly by his anguished 
daughter, Marija. 

For Milosevic, who is on ly 59, 
the future stretches out as a 
series of courtrooms and jai l 
cells. 

The man who once called him-
self "the Ayatollah Khomeini of 
Serbia" found himself jailed and 
called up before a judge investi-
gating a series of crimes, initially 
financial, that will very likely 
include more serious charges like 
conspiracy to murder political 
opponents. 

And , in time, at the end of any 
vista, is Milosevic's likely transfer 
to the international war crimes tri-
bunal in The Hague, to face 
charges over his role in the 1999 
Kosovo war, with further indict-

palpable. 

Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., 
fired off a letter after the Bush 
administration reversed itself on 
regulating carbon dioxide emis-
sions: "Mr. President, health and 
safety first! We urge you in the 
strongest possible terms to recon-
Sider your decision." 

Sen . Lincoln Chafee, R-R.I., 
when asked about the reaction 
back home, said, "There's a realiza-

ments on Bosnia and Croatia 
expected to fo llow. 

When and if that happens 
may depend on constitutional 
changes in Yugoslavia as we ll as 
continued pressure from the 
United States and other nations, 
but many here are already con-
sidering his transfer an 
inevitability despite the opposi-
tion of Milosevic's successor, 
Vojislav Kostunica. 

"For years we were in a 
kind of war with 
ourselves, " 

- Iv .. RMoVMOvic 
Serbian journalist 

Milosevic is widely considered 
to be the main protagonist behind 
the wars that broke apart 
Yugoslavia in the 1990s infighting 
between Serbs, Croats and 
Muslims that left some 200,000 
people dead. 

The Serbs who once followed 
him to battle and who voted 
against him in October reacted to 
his arrest with pleasure, indiffer-
ence or disgust - but the rallies 
of the faithful that the new gov-

tion that some of the Western sen-
ators and more conservative ele-
ments of the party are calling some 
important shots" - adding that the 
carbon dioxide issue was "an 
important one." 

Democrats, scen ting blood, 
have been scathing on the admin-
istration's recent environmental 
decisions - to oppose the Kyoto 
treaty on globa l warming, to 
reverse. a cam paign position on 
limiting carbon dioxide emissions 
from power plants, to reconsider 
new Clinton administration stan-
dards on arsenic 111 drinking 
water. 

In the Democratic response to 
Bush's radio address Saturday, 

ernment feared did not material-
ize. 

Even Milosevic 's own Serbian 
Socialist Party worked to per-
suade him to surrender after 
armed guards at his residence 
thwarted two arrest attempts at 
the start of the weekend, under-
standing that the party can have 
a future only with Milosevic 
gone. 

Ivan Radovanovic, a Serbian 
journalist and author, said the 
arrest of Milosevic, like the death 
of Romanian dictator Nicolae 
Ceausescu, left him with a sense 
of nausea. 

"Whenever a dictator gets his 
punishment, you feel a little 
sick, because for years and years 
he was on top and we have some 
responsibility for that, too," he 
said. 

"For years we were in a kind of 
war with the world and with our-
selves," Radovanovic said. "And 
now something is over, we don't 
know exactly what, but it may 
allow us a certain peace, I think. 
And it will help define a path to ' 
our future, because the West is 
where we belong."

Election: 
Blair rejected the advice of 
many in his Cabinet 
ContI ...... from ..... 1 
date of local elections - and with it 
his long-held resolve to call a 
national vote the same day. 

The spread of the highly conta-
gious foot-and-mouth is not expect-
ed to be halted by the end of the 
election delay, which many predict 
will be for one month. But Blair is 
counting on the added time to con-
vey to the public the impression that 
he will not be distracted by party 
politics from taking personal charge 
of the crisis and pointing the coun-
try back toward normality. 

The Ministry of Agriculture on 
Sunday put the number of con-
firmed cases in the six-week epi-
demic at 875, and that of livestock 
marked for slaughter in the preven-
tive cull at 940,000. 

A poll by Mari, published in The 
Sunday Telegraph, suggested the 
perils that Blair might have encoun-
tered if he had persisted with a vote 
on May 3: It showed his Labor·Party 
losing three points from its 19-point 
lead in the past three days, all 
because of unease in rural areas. 

While putting off any official 

word until Monday's announce-
ment, 10 Downing St. alerted the 
BBC and selected newspapers on 
Saturday night to the outcome of 
the week of fevered political con-
sultations. It would be the' first sus-
pension of lOcal elections - which, 
unlike the national. vote, are on a 
regular schedule - since World 
War II . 

In making his decision, Blair 
rejected the advice of many mem-
bers or-his Cabinet and a majority 
of Labor members of Parliament, 
who were eager to capitalize on the 
party's favorable showing in opin-
ion surveys. 

They are also worried that delay 
could expose the party to the dan-
gers of suddenly decl ining economic 
fo rtunes or some other event in 
what has been a star-crossed period 
of natural calamities and public-ser-
vice collapses in Britain. 

In addition to the foot- and-
mouth epidemic, Britain has had 
the worst floods in 400 years, fatal 
tra in crashes and speed restrictions 
on the rai ls that have caused havoc, 
and a wildcat protest of gasoline 
taxes that managed to close down 
90 percent of British supplies to 
motorists almost overnight.

Finance Refonn May 
Enchance Committee's Role 

WASHINGTON - While the 
campaign finance measure that is 
moving apace through Congress 
makes fundamental changes in 
how interest groups influence 
American politics, one major con-
duit for their donations would 
emerge virtually untouched: politi-
cal action committees. 

Indeed, some of the largest 
PACs, like those sponsored by 
gun owners, real estate agents, 
teachers, environmentalists and 
government employees, could 
find their political influence 
enhanced, according to experts in 
campaign finance: 

That is because the heart of the 
measure that is expected to be 
approved by the Senate on 
Monday is its prohibition on the 
unregulated contributions to polit-
ical parties, known as soft money. 
By contrast, the legislation does 
not tighten controls on the largest 
political action committees that 
collect regulated funds called hard 
money. 

Moreover, the largest PACs, 
particularly those sponsored by 
labor groups and large member-
ship groups like the Sierra Club, 
rely heavily on voter mobilization 
efforts like telephone banks and 
get-out-the-vote drives that are 
not addressed in the legisl?tion. 

sions put moderate Republicans 
"in a difficult place," with a choice 
of either breaking with the admin-
istration or alienating their subur-
ban constituents. 

William K. Reilly, who was 
administrator of the 
Environmental Protection Agency 
for Bush's father, also noted that 
Bush's decision on carbon dioxide 
had come "awfully early." 

"One really has to hope - and I 
really do believe - it's not the last 
word," Reilly said. 

Many Republican moderates 
were delighted by the appoint-
ment, early on, of one of their 
own to the top EPA job - former 
New Jersey Gov. Christie 

So suddenly the large labor 
groups, corporations, trade associ-
ations and ideological organiza-
tions that funnel their political 
largess through PACs may find 
that they are the biggest players on 
the field because their s9ft-money 
competitors can no longer partici-
pate. To some degree, the PACs 
could even displace the political 
parties in their power to help can-
didates. 

In interviews, representatives of 
many of the largest PACs were 
reluctant to call attention to them-
selves and hesitant to say they 
would be better off with the 
McCain-Feingold bHI. 

"I'm keeping my head down" 
said Simon Rosenberg, who runs 
the New Democratic Network, 
which helps centrist Democrats. 
"We haven't taken a position, 
because our congressional mem-
bers are divided on what should 
happen. But assuming that 
McCain-Feingold passes as is, 
we're going to keep doing what 
we're doing." 

Yet some strategists for other 
PACs acknowledged that they 
could even find their political 
influence strengthened.

Whitman. But Whitman has been 
the target of fierce criticism on 
the right, and Bush's decision on 
carbon dioxide was widely seen as 
undercutting her at a critically 
early time. 

Rep. James C. Greenwood, a 
Republican whose suburban 
Philadelphia district voted for Gore 
last year, argued: "We have to look 
for a position that may not be 
where the president is, and proba-
bly won't be where the Sierra Club 
is. But we moderate Republicans 
have to find a middle ground that's 
environmentally sensible." .

Study Fmds Schoolyard Games may 
be Psychologically Damaging 

CHAM PA1GN, Ill. 
Generations of people grew up 
pl ayi ng dodge ball and othe r 
childhood ga mes. However, 
according to a recent study, these 
games might cause psychological 
damage. 

The study, led by eil 
Williams, professor of physical 
education at Eastern Connecticut 
State Universi ty, states that many 
traditional games are played with 
the Intent to harm. These games 
also result in isolation between 
chil ren- and thei r peers, accord-
ing to the study. 

\.Vilha ms compiled a "Hall of 
Shame" list of all games that 

-should be removed from schools. 
Included in this list are dodge 
ball, kickball. Simon Says and 
Duck Duck Goose. 

Accordi ng to the list, dodge 
ball is played with an in tent to 
harm, playing kickball and Duck 
Duck Goose promotes cliques, 
and playing Simon Says eli mi-
nat,es players based on ability. 

Ruth Esry, principal of Pleasant 
Acres Elementary School in 
Rantoul, has been involved in 
educlltion for many years, during 
which she has seen children play 
these games. 

Esry admits that the games 
usually lead to isolation of certain 
children. 

"Not everyone gets chosen 
unless a teacher intervenes," Esry 
said. "There are kids that aren't as 
socially acceptable in the eyes of 
their peers." 

Although Esry agrees tnat 
some games can result in isola-
tion, she said it is an unavoidable 
rite of. passage that children are 
usually able to deal with. 

"[The gamesl will have a psy-
chological effect, but it is impossi-
ble to buffer kids from the situa-
tion," Esry said . "Everyone at 
recess plays the same game; it's 
hard to avoid those situations." 

Karl Rosengren , associa te 
professor of kinesiology and psy-
chology at the University, agrees 
that it is nearly impossible to 
shelter child ren from competi-
tive situations. 

"Some children who 
don't perform well will 
be isolated, But it is hard 
to say if competition is to 
blame, Typically, kids 
ridicule anyone who 
stands out, " 

- Kart Ro .... gr.n 
Associate Professor 

"Obviously, competition is a 
major part of society," he said. 

According to Rosengren , 
research suggests that a child with 
poor motor sklils might face a 
greater degree of social isolation. 

"Some children who don't per-
form well will be isolated," 
Rosengren said. "But it's hard to 
say if competition is to blame. 
Typically, kids ridicule anyone 
who stands out." 

Esry said reactions to isolation 
vary from student to student, and 
the exact reaction cannot be fore-
seen. 

"[The games] may cause us to 
be vin~ictive," Esry said. "But it is 
important to minimize the effects 

[of isolation] ." 
RoseRgren said the trend in 

education over the last 15 years 
has been on build ing self-esteem. 
He relates the push to eliminate 
certain types of games' to \he 
elimination of tracking (grouping 
students based on academic abil-
ity) in many school dis tricts 
nationwide. 

Esry said orga nized sportS, 
such as football and soccer, are 
more psychologically damaging. 
However, unlike the games at 
recess, students who play orga-' 
nized sports choose to do so and 
are generally more mature than 
students who play childhood 
games. 

"Typically, the more organized 
sports are geared toward older 
child ren," Esry said. ''They've 
learned to deal with rejection ." 

The findings of the studies 
surprised many students. Some 
wondered why more organized 
sports were not included in the 
lis t. 

Alec Trachtman, freshman in 
LAS, played both chi ldhood 
games and organized sports. He 
said the competitive environment 
changes with age. 

"When you' re younger, you 
take things differently," 
Trachtman said . "You feel that 
there's more peer pressure when 
you're younger." 

He disagrees with the study on 
the basis that teachers would not 
create isolation. 

"Teachers are the ones who 
Intttate the games," said 
Trachtman. "I don 't see why 
teachers would promote cliques."

An increase in Pell-grants 
could help students 
Continued from page 1 

departments. 
According to the White House 

Web site, President Bush's budget 
proposes to increJse the amount 
of money available for Pell 
Grants. 

The proposal would add ant' 
billion dollars to the existing fund 
for Pell Grants, White House 
spokesman Scott Stanzel said. He 
said the money would be used to 
"increase the maximum award, to 
provide more need based aid for 
low-Illcome students." 

Martinez said an increase in 
Pell Gran ts would hclp low 
Income students. 

"It is important If the Pell 
Grant IS raised so it Will cover 
more expenses," Martinez said. 

In order to qualify for financial 
aid at the University, Martinez 
said a student must first complete 
a Free Application for Federal 
Student Aid form . The informa-
tion provided de termines the stu -
dent's expected family contribu-
tio n. This number is subtracted 
fro m the estimated cost to attend 
college to determine the amount 
of aid for which the, student is eli-
gible. 

Nearly all student aid, includ-
ing money from federal. state and 
some private scholarships, is han-
dled by the office of Student 
Financial Aid , Martinez said . 

Las t year the total was 
$170,603,000. Despite these 
funds, there were still students 
who were unable .to attend the 
University because of financial 
concerns. 

Martinez said one reason fo r 
this was because some aid is given 
in the form of a loan to the par-

'EWS 9 

tnts. The penod for 1o,\11 repa\'-
mcnt starts Oll day after tUIt" n 
bills for the spring semcster ,Ire 
mailed . Many parcnts an: unWill -
ing to accept the loan because 01 

I this deadline, and the student's 
financial needs go unmcl. This 
has led to loans from alternative 
sources, such as banks, bCCOlllll1g 
more common In recent years. 

Maria Mendler, vice president 
in the Public Affairs fti e '1' r 
Cittbank, said the company offers 
several different programs to help 
students meet the ir flnal1CI.tI 
needs. 

"Private 10a l1s help bnd~e the 
gap between a ~tudc l1l 's tin,ll1Cldl 
aid and the cost I' gOing llJ ,'vl-. 
lege." i'.lendler said. 

Lack of aid is n't he "Illy 
fi nancial problem students face. 
Some students come from mldllk 
income famriics whose "lnCOIl1C IS 
not high bu r don't tjuahty fv!' 
aid," Martinez said. 

He said the nlversltV Will 
often try to help students ivhose 
financial needs aren't Illet 
because of special circumstances. 

"It depends on the sttuation," 
Martinez said . "Some ci rcum-
stances happen to make families 
less able to cover expenses, like 
yo u had a job and now you don 't 
have one anymore. In those cases 
we make adjus tments."

Launch, an online media com-
pany, has been going about their 
business in a legal manner to 
avoid any lawsuits that have virtu-
ally wiped out many other online 
music sites. Also, Launch offers 
personalized radio stations that 
cater to the listeners' tastes and 
online live video feeds. 

The company may also be a 
step ahead of the underground 
music scene as well, as they pur-
chased the Vans Warped Tour last 
year. Warped is one of the most 
successful concert festivals of the 
summer. And this year, the tour 
will feature bands such as 311, 
New Found Glory, Weezer, 
Rancid, Pennywise and Less Than 

The UCSD Guardian 

Jake. All of these bands have 
downloads (if labels permit), news 
and bios at Launch's Web site. 

There is also much more to 
come from Launch . The Wall 
Street Journal recently reported 
:hat Launch may be at the head of 
the pack once Napster dies down. 
Chief Executive of Launch Dave 
Goldberg already has good ties 
with most of the major labels. The 
Journal says once the firl~ dies 
down from the Napster debates, 
Goldberg will be one of the first 
allowed to negotiate with record 
labels on the rights to download-
ing songs. 

Iowa State University students 
may lose the most when Napster 
is finally gone. Although the 
school was encouraged to shut 
down the use of Napster in the 
past year, Iowa State has contin-

ued to allow its students to use 
the program. 

With high connections on 
. campus, many students have 

expanded their MP3 libraries to 
more than 1,000 songs. 

James Luck, junior in manage-
ment information systems, has 
built his collection of MP3 files to 
more than 1,500. 

"I used to use Napster in 
spurts: Luck says. "I'd go a week 
without even logging on, and then 
one day I'd sign on and download 
30 to 40 songs." 

However, Luck is not worried 
about Na pster's eventual disap-
pearance. 

"There are other programs like 
IMesh that are actually a step up 
from Napster: Luck says. "You 
can download movies, games and 
pictures, plus you get speedier 

NEWS 11 

connections." 
The use of these programs is 

still small, and as with apst~r, 
the variety of songs usu ally 
depends on who is signed on to 
share the songs. However, when 
Napster is no longer available to 
digital down loaders, they will be 
looking for new programs to fill 
their needs. 

'Tm sure when apster closes. 
users will shoot up for these other 
programs," Luck says. 

Most music fans are not afraid 
of the loss of Napster. Once it is 
finally gone, down loaders will 
take their business elsewhere. 
After all , the Web provides a 
plethora of options for music 
fans. You just have to know where 
to look.

n
e true concept of 

feminism is a foreign 
one to most people. 
For some, feminism 
is equated with 
hoards of bra burn-

ers hell-bent on fighting all that 
is phallic and male in our soci-
ety, Others may have images of 
privileged white women going 
off on a first-wave feminist rant, 
failing to include the majority of 
the population of women who 
don 't consider the ability to 
work a luxury. 

It is this baseless cry of the 
ignorant that the members of 
the undergraduate academic 
group Women Inciting Social 
Change wish to dispel with theit 
April 11 'conference titled 

"Exploring 'Feminine' Bodies." It 
is also one of the ' first confer-
ences at UCSD to be organized 
exclusively by undergraduate 
students. 
ConceptIon 

For many in the critical gen-
der studies department, the 
extensive focus on theory can be 
frustrating, because it doesn't 
necessarily lead to action or to 
solutions. WISC members felt 
that by organizing the confer-
ence, they would be creating a 
practical application of their 
knowledge. 

WISC is composed of four 
UCSD undergraduate women 
and two alumni CGS majors. 

The conference idea was 
originally conceptualized by 

Cindy Wu, a recent graduate of 
UCSD who attended a confer-
ence and wanted to bring the 
information that she had learned 
to UCSD, 

"I wanted to accomplish two 

things with this conference,· Wu 
said. "First, I wanted to learn 
how to organize a conference, 
and second, I wanted to really 
explore the ideas and concepts 
that we have learned in this 
major and share them with 
UCSD students who may not 
have access to feminist theory 
classes." 

She organized her informa-
tion and took it to professor 
Rosemary George, head of the 
CGS department, who felt that 
Wu's idea was sound. 

Together with Nancy Hatch, 
the department coordinator, 
they organized a 198-person 
class that took place last fall 
quarter that was designed to 
facilitate the organization of the 

conference. In this way, students 
had a disciplined way to organize 
the structure of the conference 
and issues they wanted to dis-
cuss, and were able to receive 
academic credit for thei r endeav-
ors, 

The group WISC, was devel-
oped in the class as a way to get 
financial support from the uni-
versity. It was developed around 
the idea of the conference, but 
has turned into something mort!. 

According to its constitution, 
WISC is a student-run organiza-
tion composed of UCSD stu-
dents with a common mission to 
promote critical thinking and 
activism on issues of gender,

the members have found that they 
have learned more than just how to 
organize a conference. Together, by 
personally engaging the theories 
presented to them in class, they 
have learned a lot more in their 
classes. Additionally, the support 
that they provide to each other in 
study sessions for classes has made

According to Heidi Saman, co-
director of programming, several 
departments offer courses that 
encourage a deeper evaluation of 
established labels, however not all 
students have access to these class-
es. 

By JEFFREY WHITE 
Copy Editor 

Currently up for review by the 
U.S. Supreme Court is the consti-
tutionality of carrying out the 
death sentence on mentally 
retarded ki lIers. 

Again at the forefront of this 
legal battle is convicted rapist and 
murderer John Paul Penry, who has 
an IQ somewhere between 51 a~d 
63, and who has, according to his 
lawyer, the intellect of a 7 -year-old. 

As you probably remember, 
back in 1989 the Supreme Court 
used Penry 's case to rule that the 
execut ion of mentally retarded 
murderers is not a violation of the 
Eighth Amendment's ban on 
cruel and unusual punishment. 

Well , it seems Penry is going to 
ge t another shot at it, as the 
nation's highest court has agreed 
to reconsider his case. 

Personally, I don 't see why 
Penry or any mentally retarded 
convict on death row should be 
treated differently because of his 
lack of intelligence. If anything, 
that would make the punishment 
more humane, as mentally inferior 
convicts would not fully under-
stand the process and would prob-
ably not be so anxious or afraid. 

Thus, in a sense, it could be 
argued tha t it would actually be 
slightly more morally palatable to 
execute someone who lacks the 
brainpower to rea lly comprehend 
what is happening. 

Also, if the court upholds its 
prior decision to allow mentally 
retarded murderers to be execut-
ed, it sends out a message to all 
would-be felons that our justice 
system does not tolerate such 
heinous crimes as murder and 
rape, meaning capital punishment 
would remain intact as a deterrent 
to such activities. 

However, the death penalty is 
not a deterrent as it is currently 

This may seem like a 
somewhat radical 
proposition, but really, it 
is not. Public executions 
were commonplace 
worldwide for centuries, 
even in this country, 
until relatively recently. 

administered. Study after study 
has shown this to be the case. 

One thing that certainly does 
not help the death penalty to be 
the deterrent that it could is the 
fact that very few actua)ly know 
what goes. on when a person is 
executed in an electric chair, gas 
chamber or by lethal injection. 

Even educated people have a 
difficult time actually grasping the 
concept of death. However, seeing 
it with one's own eyes would cer-

tainly help a person understand the 
gravity of being put to death. This is 
why I think that executions should 
be televised. 

Like C-SPAN, which televises 
the proceedings taking place on 
Capitol Hill, I think there should 
be a channel that airs executions. 
This way, we get more bang for our 
buck when we kill one of our pris-
oners. Ideally, much like C-SPAN, 
this channel would be free, even if 
you forget to pay that cable bill. 

If you saw what actually hap-
pens when someone is electrocut-
ed to death in the electric chair, or 
when a human dies of asphyxia-
tion in the gas chamber, that 
would be a pretty powerful experi-
ence - possibly powerful enough 
to make you think twice before 
committing that violent crime. 

This may seem like a some-
what radical proposition, but real-
ly, it is not. Public executions were 
commonplace worldwide for cen-
turies, even in this country, until 
refatively recently. 

We shouldn't be ashamed of 
what our government has relegat-
ed to private, behind-closed-doors 
sessions, and instead make it as 
public as possible, which would be 
to televise all government-sanc-
tioned executions. This way, the 
death penalty will finally be given 
the chance to be an effective 
deterrent to capital crimes. 

It is true; some parents may

Patricia Cordozo, 
who was the co-

here would be the 
best place to start 
exploring social 
constructions of 
race, gender and 
sexuality. Here, the 
concept of 
" Explor ing 
'Feminine' Bodies" 
was designed. 

"We see a void 
in students aware-
ness of critical 
issues regarding 
gender, racial and 
sexual categories," 
Saman said. "Some 
fail to prioritize 
these classes in 
their rigorous aca-

dence in us is really what allowed 
us to pull this whole thing off." 

According to the university, the 
CGS department has fewer than 30 
students in the major, but accord-
ing to Landy Spencer, co-director 
of programming, the small size of 
the department is part of its appeal. 
In this case, it allowed for increased 
support from the faculty, which 
was instrumental for WISC mem-
bers' success. 

"We were rea lly excited about 
the support we received from the 

demic schedules, and therefore 
never take the opportunity to sam-
ple the incredible resources that 
UCSD offers in the academic study 
of these issues." 

Departments such as cri tical 
gender studies are interdisciplinary 
by design. This allows students to 
sample classes from a variety of dif-
ferent departments and to explore 
the important issue of gender from 
a variety of different perspectives.

Romantic passions will now 

steadily increase, Aries. Early

Top speakers have been

Continued from page 14 

"By taking gendered perspec-
tives into account in a variety of 
different disciplines, we discover 
exactly how pervasive perceptions 
of gender are in influencing social 
behavior," Cardozo said. "We want-
ed to cre3re a conference that 
allowed students to explore the dis-
cipline of gender studies and devel-
op a greater understanding of how 
the issues in the major affect every-
one. This increased understanding 
and awareness will allow for greater 
sensitivity of UCSD students who . 
are entering the world as prospec-
tive participants in institutionalized 
and socialized behavior." 

The founders ofWlSC envision 
a conference where the intersec-
tion of race, class and sexuality are 
explored through and against ide-
ologies of gender. 

According to Wu, their hope for 
this conference is to enlighten par-
ticipants to new conceptualizations 
of feminine bodies. They also hope 
that the diversity of the speakers 
will allow people to explore the 
issues on their own, and will also 
challenge the ideology that certain 
groups are not touched by race or 
gender, and encourage a deeper 
understanding of supposedly invis-
ible categories. 

"This conference would allow 
students easy access to information 
that they may not otherwise come 
into contact with: Spencer said. 
"By giving students access to the 
incredible professors that UCSD 
has working in this department, we 
promote a greater understanding of 
social issues colored by a gendered 
lens, and the importance and sig-
nificance of this area of study. 
TIle Ipuk.,. 

According to Saman, the grour 
invited the professors whom they 
felt best embodied the ideas that 
the group wanted to share. She 
feels that the group has been very 
fortunate that the UCSD profes-
sors whom they asked to partici-
pate have all been enthusiastic sup-
porters of the students. 

"We were really lucky that the 
UCSD professors who we asked to 
participate were able to take time 
out of their busy schedules to par-
ticipate," Saman said. "I've been 
working with them for the last few 
months and everyone is so won-
derful. The talks are going to be 
really exciting." 

The keynote speaker, professor 
Judith Halberstam of the literature 
department, is . a universal favorite 
among critical gender studies 
majors and members of the litera-
ture department. Her talk will 
highlight new lesbian subcultures, 
including dyke punk bands, slam 
poets and drag kings. Her talk, -
entitled "Female Masculinity: The 
Body in Question" will include

power struggles will no longer play

ContInued from ..... 17 
the .agenda. 

Un (Sept. 23-0ct. 23) 
Long trusted lovers or close rel-

atives will now demand obvious and 
steady commitments, Libra. Even 
though your attention has been 
squarely focused on relationships, 
others may still wish for emotional 
or romantic promises to proceed 
more rapidly. Much of this looks 
happy and enjoyable, Libra: so not 
to worry. Do, however, avoid dis-
missing your own needs and goals. 
At present, many Librans may too 
easily give away valuable time, ener-
gy and emotiona1. resources. 

ScorpIo (Oct. 24-Nov. 21) 
Family duties and emotional 

home discussions are accented early 
this week, Scorp. Over the next few 
days, watch fo r a close relative or 
long-term friend to ask for added 
emotional support. Stand your 
ground, Scorp: This is not a good 
time to let others dictate your 
schedule, daily habits or commit-
ments. After F-riday, romantic pas-
sions are compelling: Expect a pre-
viously subtle attraction to soon 
demand action .

opment. After Friday, check finan -
cial records for obvious mistakes: 
Changed deadlines may soon be 
bothersome. 

Aquarius (Jan. 2()'Feb. 18) 
Before midweek, Aquarius, a 

close friend or work mate may reveal 
unexpected romantic information. 
New attractions or private office pas-
sions may soon trigger fast emotion-
al changes in your social circle. After 
Friday, group involvement, increased 
social gossip or suddenly passionate 
proposals are accented. Go slow, 
Aquarius: Serious intentions are 
involved. 

Plsen (Feb. 19-March 20) 
Business and social events may 

now lead to positive workplace 
gains, Pisces. Over the next few 
weeks, watch closely for I,Inusual 
opportunities in the areas of prop-
erty management, financial coun-
seling, corporate advancement or 
accounting. After Thursday, a rare 
romanJic flirtation may be both 
unexpected and c;ielightfully seduc-
tive, Pisces: Enjoy! 
If Your ~ I. till. Week: 

Group relationship,s and social 
demands will be complex over the 
next nine weeks. Many Aries 
natives will now experience a brief 
but intense period of conflicted 
social information and personality 
struggles in business relationships. 
Aries: Planetary alignments suggest 
that your words, actions and sug-
gestions will do little to improve 
the opinions of the bold, willful 
types. By mid-June, a 14-month 
period of home progress, family 
decisions and new romantic com-
mitments arrives.

Soapbox: 
Children shauld be exposed 
to executions as well 
ContInued from ..... 14 
not want their children to see real 
death on television. Well, that's 
what that box in the comer of the 
screen is for that says "'IV-MA." 
And frankly, parents should be in 
control of what programs their 
children watch, anyway. 

However, children , are already 
exposed to so much death in the 
media and in television shows, it 
would be somewhat pointless not 
to allow them to watch the execu-
tions. The only difference between 
waching an execution and the 
countless other shows in which 
-people are killed would be that par-
ents would have to explain to their 
children that these are real people 
actually being killed for crimes they 
have committed. 

In fact, parents should make it 
very clear to their children exactly 
who is executing these people; that it 
is in fact mommy and daddy killing 
them. Or maybe mommy and daddy 
dotit even realize that fact. 

Fortunately, I have another 
- proposition: execution duty. 

Execution duty would be the 
equivalent of jury duty, except that 
U.S. citizens would be chosen at 
random to "throw the switch" for 
all execu tions. 

It is true that this would create a 
huge amount of bureaucracy and 
probably some moral objections as 
well. But really, we are all "throwing 
the switch" already, as we more 
than tolerate - in fact, overwhelm-
ingly support - the .death penalty 
in this country. 

So really, it wouldn't be any dif-
ferent if we physically killed the 
prisoners ourselves. People would 
just be more aware of what they 
have been doing all along. That 
can't be a bad thing . . 

1 want to throw the switch myself. 
I want to see, with my own two eyes, 
that convicted felon die as his body 
is electrocuted or poison~d. I want 
the reality that I already kill on a reg-
ular basis to be real in my mind, for 
that fact to be concrete and tangible. 

This doesn 't make me crazy. It'$ 
already what I'm doing. It 's already 
what you're doing. 

Face it: You have blood on your 
hands - though unfortunately not 
literally, si nce the government 
we've elected is so good at keeping 
our murders out of sight, therefore 
out of mind. 

That's why it should be on tele-
vision . That's why we should be 
forced to throw the switch our-
selves. That's why we should have 
to tell our little children that 
mommy and daddy kill people. 
Maybe then we will actually realize 
what we are doing. And once we 
do, maybe then we will actually be 
in a position to decide whether we 
approve of capital punishment. 

I agree with what former 
Supreme Court Justice Thurgood 
Marshall once said: "The question 
with which we must deal is not 
whether a substantial proportion of 
American citizens would today, if 
polled, opine that capital punish-
ment is barbarously cruel, but 
whether they would find it to be so 
in light of all information presently 
available." 

So get all the information 
presently available, so you can at 
the very least put yourself in a bet-
ter position to make that decision .

Canference promises to be 
fon and educational 
ContInued from ..... 17 
music and video clips and will 
focus on four basic ideas includ-
ing the significance of the cate-
gories queer and female on this 
subgroup. 

The structure of the confer-
. ence has Halberstam speaking 
first, followed by two concurrent 
sessions thaI' will be in the San 
Francisco/Santa Cruz Room and 
the Santa Barbara/Los Angeles 
Room. 

One of the concurrent sessions 
will feature professor George 
Lipsitz, a prominent faculty mem-
ber in the ethnic studies depart-
ment of UCSD, and professor 
Kath leen Jones, a faculty member 

The UCSD Guardian 

at SDSU. The topic. of this session 
will be · Working Bodies and the 
Economics of Gender." . 

Lipsitz's presentation will focus 
on the organizations of work and 
its influences on all aspects of our 
existence, including the sexual and 
gender identities that we inhabit 
and envision. 

Jones will concentrate on map-
ping women's social locations in 
formal and informal economies. 
She will also explore contexts for 
understanding the political econo-
my of gender and the impact of 
this political economy on the indi-
vidual and collective strategies of 
survival and resistance. 

The other concurrent session 
will focus on racialized bodies and 
will feature professors Daphne 
Brooks and Lisa Yoneyama, who 
are members of the literature 
department. 

Brooks will focus on a paper 

titled "'It Needs A Bottom': (Re) 
Covering the Black Female Body 
in the Works of Suzan-Lori 
Parks." She will engage the various 
topics brought up in the paper 
about the politics of black feminist 
representations. 

WlSC members anticipate that 
Yoneyama wi ll focus on issues 
surrounding Asian-American race 
and sexuality. 
A F1n. Ev. nln, 

For anyone who has ever been 
remotely interested in finding out 
more about gender studies, this 
evening promises to be both . 
entertaining and informative. 

The several speakers who have 
been secured for the conference 
bring a refreshing blend of knowl-
edge and experience that are sure 
to bring provocative thoughts to 
the table throughout the evening.

Triton Baseball Has Seen Better Days Tennis: Tritons down Cal Poly 
Pomona in CCAA Action UCSD has a couple of flashes of great play, but sti II loses four of six 
ContInued from pall. 24 By ROBERT FULTON 

Sports Editor 

The UCSD baseball team had a 
disappOinting break by winning 
only three games and losing six. 

The Tritons had a tough time 
ag~lI1st California Collegiate Ath-
leuc Association rival Cal State 
Dominguez Hills. They lost the 
first game on the road 4-2 and fell 
in the second 7·3. 

When the two teams came to 
UCSD for a doubleheader, the 
outcome was a little different. 

In the first game of a double-
header, the Tritons span 'ed the 
Torros 12-6 . 

Matt Smith was the offensive 
star for UCSD, getting tnrer hits 
to score three runs while garner-
ing three RBis. 

Tyler Sullivan contributed with 
two runs, and Chad Addison and 
Ryan Larson each had a pair of 
RBis. 

Erik Snyder picked up the win 
_for (ICSD, striking out four. 

Robert Peelle came in relief and 
- allowed only two hits in two 

innings of work. 
[n the second game of the dou-

bleheader, the tale turned to the 
old ways, with UCSD losing 7-3. 

It was to be more of the same 
for UCSD against Grand Canyon 
University, another CCM foe. 

The two teams got together for 
a pair of doubleheaders. 

In the first game, the Tritons 
were trounced 15-8. 

[n the second game, UCSD had 
an early lead, up 2-0. Late runs by 
the Antelopes pulled out the Victo-
ry for the [cam from Arlzon . 

For the first oame on tne sec-
ond day of doubleheaae s LiCSD 
turned 'it around. WII1I11r. ; -; . :

David Hawk and Connor Moc-

sny shared offensive honors for 
UCSD, each getting two hits, two 
RB[s and each scoring a run. Ryan 
Larson had two RBIs and a run. 
Chad Addison had four hits to 
drive in a run and score a run . 

The winning pitcher for UCSD 
was lohn Beaven, who sat down

The momentum of the first 
game did not carry to the second 
as UCSD fell 15-5. 

For a .change of pace, UCSD 
took on old rival Point Loma 

azarene University, winning 9·6. 
Chad Addison had three hItS, 

two RBIs and two runs. 
Eric Thorpe also had three hits, 

two of them comll1g In the form of 
doubles. Anthom' Lococo also had

had a double and drove in two 
runs. 

Andy Hanau picked up the win 
for UCSD, striking out fou r. 

Three other pitchers helped 
out in relief. .

all.

Williams is one of the strongest 
Division III teams in the country 
and the Tritons knew this would be 
a tough task, as they lost to 
Will iams last season. 

UCSD could manage only a win 
at o. 1 singles by 0' ell and .It 
No.5 singles by Hung in Its ~.~

"I knew going into the match 
that they were going to be rea l:)'

ROBERT FULTON 

T he other day, I was perusing a local publication and I carne across an article that 
got my attcntlon. It was about a 
stripper. That will always do it. 

There is thiS girl who <lllends 
Cal State Northridge and shc strips 
to make money. Yeah, yo u know 
what I'm talking abo ut. The 
removal of clothes while men ogk 
her. The exploitation of women 
and all of thaI. 

She is also on the track and field 
tcarn. I' should I say she was on 
the track and field team. 

You see, she got kicked off of 
the team when the coaches found 
out what she was doing as a profes-
sion. I am not sure what the rea-
soning is, but I guess it is not 
appropriate for a member of the 
track tcam to bear her breasts for a 
buck. 

This totally sucks. 
What do the two have to do 

with each other? Well, other than 
the fact that you need a hard body 
for both and need to be in good 
shape in general, there is no corre-
lation . 

I mean. if you work late strip-
ping, you may not be ready for a 
meet the next morning. And your 
ass may be tired. BlIt hey, this the 
same for any Job tha t lIlvolves late 
hours. 

We all know how difficult it is to 
balance s(hool. recreation and 
work. We 'lIT each good at so me-
thlllg, some of us many things. It 
Just so happens that this young 
Iddy does well 5tnpping. She also is 
good at track and tield. The fact 
that she gOt kICked off is bogus. 
Hell. I \\'ould Strlp If I had the body. 
Stl'lppcrs make all klllds of money. 
Right 11011', I wou ld probably be 
paid to put my clothes back on 
lIlstl'~d of to take them off. 

1\lcmbcrs of the baseball team 
are the ones who blew her cover. 
How did Ihey tind out? Well , by 
gOlllg to watch her perform, of 
course. They too are in trouble 

I'm Just'saying as long as It is 
legal, It is tint: for someone to do as 
a Jab. Who IS to Judge? 

This gotmc to wondering about 
our own athktes. We are a non-
scholarship school. There are a 
number of athletes here struggling 
to make mds meet. Are there any 
athletes out there attending th is 
school who work at strip clubs? 
There are tlVO ways to find out. 

I could just ask, which would be 
boring. "Excuse me, do you strip.?" 
Then you would hear a slap. 

The other alternative would be 
to send my crack team of reporters 
to the local strip joints to see if 
there are any ... uh ... faces we rec-
ognize. Hell, anyo ne from the 
Guardian could go and do research. 
We could learn the working habits 
of student-athletes. 

I am not limiting this to just 
females. There may be some male 
strippers out there. Now, I sure as 
hell am not going to see male strip-
pers, but I can send someone from 
the office. Maybe my friend the 
news editor is willing. 

Surviving school is not a crime. 
Stripptng is not a crime.

Tennis Takes Three 
Spring break is goo.d for the Triton women, going 3-1 
By BILL BURGER 
Senior Staff Writer 

When we last saw the 
women's tennis team, it was 5-2 
he?oing for a stretch of four big 
matches in two weeks. While we 
were studying for finals and sun-
ning and drinking in Mexico, 
Arizona or wherever, the team 
went 3-1, including one win in 
the CCM. 

The first match for th e 
women was aga inst Emory Uni-
versity of Georgia. The .match 
was close from the beginning, 
but the Tritons pulled out a close 
5-4 victory in the end. 

Emory was strong at the top, 
winning at both o. 1 and No. 2 
singles, but the Tritons' depth 
won out in the end. 

From th ere, UCSD moved on 
to play the University of Denver. 
This was another nonleague 
opponent with a strong upper 
echelon of players. 

The Tritons won only one of 
the three doubles matches, that 
being a victory at No.3 by Mary 
Hung and Ashley 0 ' eil. 

Things didn 't look much .bet-
ter at the top of the singles 
matches, as O'Neil fell 6-0, 6-2 at 
No. 1 and Lyndsay Tadlock lost 
6-4, 6-2 at No. 2 singles. Depth 
again came through for the Tri-
tons, though, as the bottom four 
si ngles players all won their

matches to spurn UCSD on to a 
5-4 victory. 

The match came down to the 
NO. 5 singles match where Julie 
Westerman pulled out a third 
set tie-breaker after also win -
ning the first set to win the 
match . 

"I honestly don't remember 
playing [Denver and Emory] 
before. so I personally didn't 

have any expectations going into 
the match," said Melisa Liao, the 
Tritons' No.3 singles player. "It 
just so happened that they were 
indeed very good teams, and 
luckily we were able to pull 
through to victory." . 

From there the going got 
rough for UCSD, as the Tritons

Men's Tennis Returns Aft~r Layoff 
Team goes 1-2 
after three weeks 
of no competition 
By BILL BURGER 
Semor Staff Writer 

After a layoff lasting nearly 
three weeks, the men's tennis 
team got back into action Friday 
agai nst Gustavus Adolphus Col-
lege and then competed in two 
matches on Saturday, one against 
Cal State Los Angeles and one a 
make-up match against Cal Poly 
Pomona. 

UCSD went 1-2 in the three 
matches, losing 5-4 against 
Pomona and Gustavus but tri-
umphing 8-1 against Cal State 
LA. 

The match against Gustavus 
started out well as UCSD pulled 
out two wins in doubles. The 
most exciting match was at o. 3 
doubles, where Amir Nejas and 
Everett Schroeter won their 
match in a tie-breaker. 

The Tritons went into the 
doubles competition needing 
only three match victories to win 
the overall match. Unfortunately 
they could only muster two in 
the loss. 

Both of those wins came at 
the top. Sameer Chopra pulled 
out a close three-setter at No. 1 
singles and Jeff Wilson had little 
trouble winning 6-1, 6-4 at No. 2 
singles. 

Unfortunately the depth of 
the Tritons, along with some bad 
luck, let them down. ' 

At No. 4 singles, Cory Moder-
hak lost two tie-breakers that 
could have gone either way. Had 
the Tritons won at No. 4 they 
would have won the match. 

Tyler Huffl GuardIan 
Yeah: UCSD 's Dan Albrecht strikes a pose during a match earlier this year. 

From there the Tritons went 
on to play Cal State Los Angeles. 
This match is typically a close 
one for UCSD, but the match 
was certainly not a typical one 
between the two teams. 

UCSD rolled in doubles, win-
ning all three matches in easy 
fashion . Nejas and Schroeter had 
the easiest time, winning 8-0. 

[n singles, the Tritons won 
five of the six matches, including 
two double bagles by Moderhak 
and Blake Wilson-Hayden at No. 
4 and No. 5 respectively. 

[n their final match over the 
break, the Tritons took on 
Pomona. Early on it looked as 
though the Tritons would quick-
ly dismantle their opponents. 

[n doubles, the Tritons won 
all three pro sets. Moderhak and 
Wilson won 8-5 at No. 1 and 
Chopra teamed up with Ryan 

Thompson to win 8-6 at No. 2'. 
At 0: 3, Schroeter and Nejad 
completed their perfect doubles 
record over the break with a 8-2 
victory. 

Singles was an entirely differ-
ent story. The Tritons could only 
garner one victory, that by Wil-
son at No. 2. The other Tritons 
fell, three in three sets, as 
Pomona came from behind to 
take out UCSD. 

With the two losses and one 
victory, the Tritons' record now 
stands at 7-6 on the season. 

The Tritons have a week off 
before taking on Sonoma State 
University at the UCSD north 
courts on Saturday at 11 a.m. 
After that UCSD goes on the 
road for a series of CCM match-
es. Get out to the north couns on 
Saturday to root your Tritons on 
to victory.

YlIIIIIIIJ's for IIIJ tunIInys: Krispy Kmne is setting up a store at the 0IUt useless Chi Cafe and the public is obviously

Krispy Kreme to Displace C'he 
Hippie environmentalist vegan screwballs 
protest takeover by purveyor of sugary treats 
By GIOVANNI CARMUlI 
Senior Staff Writer 

The university signed an agreement Friday 
with Krispy Kreme Doughnut Corp., allowing 
the corporate giant to open a store on the 
UCSD campus in the building currently 
inhabited by the Che Cafe. 

The agreement will involve a one-year, 
multi-million dollar renovation of the build-
ing. The new Krispy Kreme will be open 24 
hours a day and include a convenient drive-
through window. 

For the time being, the restaurant will be 
opening its doors beginning Friday morning 
and remain open for business for the rest of 
the quarter. The store will be closed while the 

. building undergoes a complete renovation 
over the summer, and will reopen fall quarter. 

The university will receive over $100,000 
per year from the company in exchange for 
the space. This additional revenue will go 
toward badly needed administrative pay rais-
es. 

Members of the Che Cafe expressed out-
rage over the termination of their space agree-

ment with the university. 
University administrators said that the 

Che Cafe will be given new space on the cam-
pus once the campus life fee referendum 
passes this spring. 

They added that the transition would be 
smooth, and that the Che would only be with-
out space for a year or two. 

Most students expressed excitement over 
the new store while five students staged a 
protest on Library Walk over the temporary 
loss of the Che Cafe. 

"This is a terrible example of ongoing cor-
porate greed on this campus: one demon-
strator said. "We are completely student-run 
and the university is basically closing us 
down. It is just another in a series of steps 
taken against us over the past three Ylars." 

Passersby, however, had their .own opin-
ions about the new project. 

"This will be a great use of space that is 
basically going unused: said Warren junior 
Sandra Collins. "I can't wait until we can get 
fresh Krispy Kremes on campus. And I also 
think it's great that we'll be generating rev-
enue for the administration ."

Tuesday Classes 
Canceled Due to 
Power Crunch 
Price Center fountain, lab 
rats sought to ease strain 
By VOTRE MERE 
Senior Staff Writer 

In response to complications 3r1Slllg frl'In 
California's energy crisis, Tuesday classes III 
some on-campus buildings will be CilllCl:kd 
due to a cri tical power supply shortage. 

Facing difficulties from Inultiple angles -
campus power supplier Enron Corpora lion , 
California's own waning power supply and the 
UCSD cogeneration plant, still under con-
struction - UCSD will become subject start-
ing Monday at midnight to the rolling black-
outs that have plagued San Diego County for 
two weeks. 

Unreliable power supply forced UCSD 
Physical Plant Services and the Office of the 
Vice Chancellor of Resource Management and 
Planning to issue a joint statement Friday, indi-
cating that power would be cut to major cam-
pus facilities on Tuesday between 7 a.m. and 
5:30 p.m. 

The mandate affects classes in Warren 
Lecture Hall , the Humanities and Social 
Sciences Building, McGill Hall and all classes 
in Center Hall . Students who have not been 
contacted by their professors about Tuesday's 
schedule should e-mail or call campus depart-
ments for details and rescheduling. 

In the last month , the California Energy 
Commission has issued seven Stage 3 power 
alerts, three of which were on consecutive days. 

Sta~e 3 is the most serious of the alert levels, 
indtcating that only 1 percent of power reserves 
remain . 

Univers ity of Ca li fo rnia campuses, under 
contract with Enron Corp., are supposed to 
receive a supply of power unaffected by the 
California energy crisis. However, disputes with 
Enron have caused the company to revoke its 
contract with the university, pending a lawsuit 
flied by the university three weeks ago. The ter-
mination of the contract affects all nine UC 
campuses, including UCSD. 

Wi thout its uninterrupted supply froln 
Enron, UCSD must rely on the California mar-
ket for its power, subjecting it to the turbulence 
caused by Stage 3 alerts.

Lower-Tier UC Campuses Dropped From System 
Five campuses cut, UCSD a liability because of negative effects on average hotness 
By VITAM AGERE 
Senior Staff Writer 

In a move that sent shock 
waves through the academic 
world, UC President Richard C. 
Atkinson announced that the uni-
versity is severing its ties with five 
UC campuses. 

The campuses, described by 
Atkinson in a press conference as 
"bottom tier" and "inferior: 
received letters approved by the 
UC Board of Regents on Friday 
detailing their dissolution from the 
UC system. The campuses affected 
inrlude UC Irvine, UC Santa Cruz, 

UC Riverside, UC ,santa Barbara 
and UC Davis. 

According to sources at the UC 
Office of the President in Oakland, 
Calif., the decision to dr<1p the five 
campuses came because the un i-
versity sought "to overhaul its 
image." 

The source, who spoke on con-
dition of anonymity, stipulated 
that UC administrators made the 
move to increase the prestige of 
the university by trimming off, as 
the source put it, "the dead weight 
bringing down the other three 
UCs." 

Spokesmen for the evicted 

campuses described the move as 
an unexpected and untimely 
event. 

"We're left reeling," sa id Paul 
Masterson, media relations man-
ager for UC Davis. "We're among 
the top 25 public schools in the 
nation , so we don't understand 
why we're not good enough for 
UC." 

Administrators from the 
dropped universities called emer-
gency meetings over the weekend 
to determine how the campuses 
would respond to the university'S 
move. 

As of Monday morning, only 

two of the five affected campuses 
had formulated plans. 
Representatives for UC Riverside 
and UC Santa Cruz have stated 
that the campuses will seek mem-
bership in the California State 
University system. 

"What makes them think we 
want them?" asked Christopher 
Lawrence, a spokesman for CSU's 
central office in Bakersfield, Calif. 
"If they want to latch on to some 
other university system, it's not 
going to be us."

said that the timing of the Enron con-
tract dispute is bad for UCSD in sev-
eral ways. 

"It's enough that California is hav-
ing irs own energy problems," she said. 
"Bu t UCSD happens to be in a tight 
spot as well at the moment, since the 
cogeneration plant isn't finished." 

She said that while the construc-
tion of the campus cogeneration plant, 
which will reliably supply UCSO with 
its own power, is well on its way to 
bell1g completed, the plant will not be 
functional until May. 

PPS and its administrative contact, 
the Ofticc of the Vice Chancellor of 
Rcsourcc 1anagement and Planning, 
looked for a solution less drastic than 
the cancella tion of classes. However, it 
was Impossible to buy power from the 
already-drained Califorl1la utilities, 
and the campus budget does not pro-
vide enough to subsidize the cost of 
buying power from other states. 

After reci:iving approval from the 
Office of the Chancellor, PPS made 
the decision to self-impose blackouts 
in the busiest parts of campus on 
Tuesday, when the state enters anoth-
er Stage 3 alert. 

Navarro said that PPS has 
explored alternative power sources in 
its attempt to keep the rest of the 
campus powered through Tuesday 
night. 
. The Price Center fountain will pro-

vide enough power to illuminate the 
Price Center and Student Health 
Services by means of a small hydro-
electric generator located underneath 
the grass around the fountain. The 
Revelle Plaza fountain, however, works 
against the force of gravity, so it can-
not be exploited in the same way. 

avarro called upon UCSO's 
substantial biology and medical 
research faculty to assist in a unique 
way: by the donation of their labora-
tory rodents. 

"If we can get enough lab rats and 
hamsters by Monday night, we can 
cage them all up in a bunch of ham-
ster wheels we've gOt lined up at PPS," 
she said. uWe've hooked up these 
wheels to a generator, and the amount 
of power that could be produced by all 
the animals in captivity at UCSO 
would be enough to get at least H&SS 
started again:

Twenty·elght Muslim protesters and three of 
their Jewish counterparts were slain yesterday 
on Library Walk in a third straight day of violence 
at UCSD after the MSA-sponsored Anti·Zionism 
Week. Yesterday's deaths brought the toll of the 
recent spate of violence to 43 Muslim and five 
Jewish students. 

The majority of yesterday's deaths occurred 
when a UJS-afflliated tank rolled down Library ' 
Walk around noon, haphazardly crushing MSA pro-
testers throw Ire stones at a UJS-sponsored table. 

'Whlle we regret the deaths of students on 
both sides of the conflict. we felt the interven-
tion was necessary to prevent further violence." 
explained UJS member . Mike Rubensteinion . 
"You understand th~ security for our staff man-
nire the booth. and all UCSD students. is our 
foremost goal: . 

MSA students reject those accusations. 
"These UJS students have incurred the wrath of 
MSA and all UCSD students by tearing down our' 
booth proc laiming the truth of anti·Z ionism, " 
said an anonymous MSA militant wearing a 
black hood. "May they burn in ' hell for what 
they've done. " .

of previous days, during which UJS members 
sprayed rubber bullets on protesting Muslim stu-
dents during a rally In the Price Center.

BUSTED BY YOUR MOM 
Tuesday. March 27 

3:24 a.m.: A 22·year·old 
male student was arrested 
for sodomy outside the 
Student Center. Damage: 
Matt Damon 's anal virginity. 

8:01 a.m.: A 55·year·old 
male chancellor was detained 
by campus police for being 
intox icated in public . 
Transported to detox . 
Rejected from detox. then 
taken to county jail. Expired green card 
revoked and subject deported to Canada. 

2:31 p.m.: Campus police impounded 
your mom's ass for park ing without a ser-
vice yard permit while carry ing a gross 
unladen weight of four tons. Stored at Star 
Towing, 

3:41 p.m.: A staff member reported the 
theft of Eleanor Roosevelt College. No mone-
tary loss. 

11:10 p.m.: Campus pol ice responded to a 
noise complaint at an office behind the Che 
Cafe. Officers recoil in horror. 

Wednesday, March 28 
11:44 p.m.: All your base are belong to us. 

What you say! 
3:41 p.m.: Campus police arrest a 54-

year·qld Crit ical Gender Studies professor for 
masterminding a child porn ring. Two com-
puters and eight Preuss School students 
seized. 

Dropped: 
csu system doesn't want 
inferior campuses either 
Continued from page Dl 
administrators take, the situation 
requires decisiYe action. Without the 
university'S backing. the campuses 
are left without funding and patron-
age. Though each campus maintains 
a modest endowment, no endow-
ment can cover the day-to-day costs 
of running a university for very long. 

"Maybe we'll just try to turn 
into a private school," said UC 
Santa Barbara spokesman Mike 
Cosford. "And if that doesn't work, 
we'll blow the endowment on keg-
gers until there's nothing left." 

Though the move presents _ 
trouble for the UCs left behind, 
there has been unforeseen hard-
ship for the three remaining cam-
puses, which must bear the weight 
of being the University of 
Cali fornia bv themselves. 

The UCOP source indicated 
that UCSO narrowly escaped a 
decision to have been cut from the 
system as well, which would have 
resulted in the creation of a two-
campus University of California . 

"UCSO's respected in some aca-
demic circles, " the source said. "But 
what we were really concerned 
about was that it would bring down 
the hotness factor of the two other, 
more prestigiOUS UCs." 

The use of a "hotness factor, " a 
quantitative computation used to 
measure how good-looking a cam-
pus' student population is, has 
never been confirmed by a UC offi-
cial willing to go on the record . 

Sources at UCOP, however, 
have revealed for the tirst time that 
the hotness factor is derived by 
computing the inverse square of 
the number of contraceptive 
devices purchased on a particular 
campus during a one-year period. 
The figure is then converted to a 
percentage, a higher percentage 
indicating a hotter campus. 

Put into perspective, SOSU 
boasts a hotness factor of 97 per-
cent, while UC Berkeley'S hotness 
factor stands at 74 percent. UCSD's 
hotness factor, in stark contrast, 
ranks well within the bounds of 
expectation at 28 percent. 

"Without UCSB's presence in 
the UC system, the UC-wide hot-
ness factor will probably drop by 

• several percent: the source said. 
"UCLA and Berkeley will have to 
carry the burden for the wh,,! 
tern on their own - UCS [ 
tainly no help." 

Thursday, March 29 
8:32 p.m.: Campus police 

raided Koala office in Student 
Center. Police confiscated an 
altar, nine goats, and Doc 
Khaleghi (subject found tied 
up and naked).

San Diego Fire Department 
responded to a fire at CLiCS 
ignited by the nude table 
dancing of 20-year-old and 21· 

year-old female Groovejets. Hot damn. 

Friday, March 30 
2:15 p.m.: Officers responding to a 

noise complaint found an 18·year·old male 
student and an 18·year-old female nonaffili· 
ate copulating in the showers at Tioga Hall . 
Cited for "getting some" at this school and 
released. 

9:49 p.m.: Officers detained three 
Guardian staff members for promoting a rave 
in the Guardian offices (Paul Oakenfold spun, 
BTW) . Cited for drug violations and released. 

Saturday, March 31 
1:13 p.m.: Officers arrested three Muir 

students for disposing of toxic waste. Muir 
Quarterlies confiscated and transported to 
nuclear disposal site in Tijuana. Students

Oa sufferin ' needs ta end. 

Giving women the right to vote was the stupidest thing 
our legislative leaders ever did for the United States 
By WILLIAM CUNTON 
Ex-President and Current Pimp of Harlem 

My fellow Americans, a great injus-
tice has taken place in our nation's great 
and treasured history. Somewhere along 
the lines of time, men were fooled into 
giving wpmen the right to vote. Regard-
less of how it happened, the ugly truth is 
that it did. What we must now do is 
move to correct this 
horrible problem 
before it gets worse. 

All you fine peo-
ple need to do is give 
me the A-OK and a 
cool million dollars 
in small, unmarked 
bills, and ( will gladly 
put this horrible 
occurence behind us. 
( have some of the best spin doctors 
and public relations people that have 
ever lived . Give us a month and ( can 
guarantee that nobody will remember 
that women ever had the right to vote. 
Hell , women will be willingly giving up 
this undue burden on their pretty little 
minds. 

( know what you men are thinking. 
You think that if you support this right-
eous movement that your women-folk 
will resent you and you will be denied 
the luscious booty that we all covet so 
highly. ( have no doubt in my mind that 
this is how women convinced us to give 

them the right to vote in the first place. 
We must now band togettier as a nation 
and be srrong. 

We cannot give in again. My fellow 
men, I feel your pain in the loss of sex, 
but trust me, it will not last long. (f we 
act swiftly and efficiently, you will be 
tappin' the sweet booty before you know 
it. Just think about what it was like 
before women could vote. They were 

subserviant to us and 
would give up the 
booty whenever we 
wanted it. They even 
cooked and cleaned. (t 
was nice. (t was very, 
very nice. 

Think about the 
horror that has ha p-
pened since women 
got the right to vote. 

We banned pot, got into some really big 
wars, people got A(DS and then we 
elected George "Dubya." Yes, women's 
suffrage is truly an ugly bruise on our 
nation's great history. 

(n closing, my fellow American men 
(the true Americans), we must band 
together and fight the evil women. They 
may hold sex over our heads, but we 
must stay strong. ( have felt your pain , 
my brothers, but ( have also seen the 
light. The light that (hav seen is one 
that will illuminate and outshine this 
dark era of our history that was a 
woman's right to vote.

I k1/Zl1\( "l11)['\ 
("liZ hllllZ \\\.1\\) 

By MIKE HUNT 
Some random guy 

AIle. (March 21-April19) 
Be careful while shaving this 

week, Aries. Shaky hands make for 
nasty cuts that mi~ht not be so quick 
to stop gushing blood. Bleeding to 
death could be a real problem for 
you in the next few days. 

Teuru. (April 2()'May 20) 
You should really be careful in 

the next few days. I'm not saying 
that an angry mob will lynch you or 
anything, but, you know, accidents 
do happen. 

Gemini (May 21-June 21) 
If you don't have sex soon, you 

might never get it again. Get out 
there and give/receive a latex-
wrapped surprise before it is too late. 

Cancer (June 22-July 22) 
Expenses a little tight this 

month? You should really consider 
whoring yourself out for 30 or 40 
bucks a pop. If you turn a few tricks 
a night, the money problems will 
be a thing of the past. 

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22) 
People really don't like you. 

Haven't you noticed it lately? I 
wouldn't be surprised if someone 
found you dead in a gutter with 38 
stab wounds in the next fe'.v days. 
Try to enjoy the last days of your life. 
Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept . 22) 

If you leave a crisp 20 in the mid-
dle of the Price Center and stare at 
the box office for five minutes, a 
secret message will appear. It will say, 
''I'm a dumbass and Chancellor 
Dynes just took off with my money." 
Ubra (Sept. 23-0ct. 23) 

:-( 

Scorpio (Oct. 24-Nov. 21) 
It's about time you realized that 

school really sucks. Go pick up a 
20-sack and watch your wornes go 
up in smoke. Whtle you're at it, a 
quick shot of heroin couldn't hurt 
either. It's been a rough month. 

Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21) 
Remember that special some-

one that you've been crushing over 
for the past few weeks? You should 
really go ask them out this week. 
I'm serious. They'll totally say yes 
... Yeah right! Ha ha. You dumb 
bastard! You th ink anyone would 
want to go out with you? I'd invest 
in sheep if I were you. 

Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19) 
You people are always such 

whiny bastards. Always complain-
ing that your birthday is too close 
to Christmas and you only get one 
set of presents. Stop your bitching 
and maybe, just maybe, something 
good might actually h~ppen . 

Aquariu. (Jan. 2()'Feb. 18) 
Remember that goat that you 

had sex with la<t month? Little did 
you know It was carrying a rare 
strand of syphilis that should start 
to show symptoms within the next 
few days. Sucks for you. 

Piece. (Feb. 19-March 20) 
You're destined to be a poor alco-

holic. Stop denying the truth and 
embrace your future as the town 
drunk. Go pick up some Natty Ice 
and drop out of school. Loser.

Them Hoops 
Be Too 
Damn High 

ROBERT FULTON 

he other day, a few buds 
and I went out to the courts 
to play some hoops. Back in 

the day, my nickname was Larry 
Bird for my sweet shot. Lately, I 
have not played so much with 
studies and other responsibilities 
taking my lime. 

After stretching some and 
banging bodies down low with the 
crew, I realized why I never pur-
sued my basketball career to the 
next level. 

I am too short. 
Back during my freshman year 

of high school, I was the star of my 
high school team. I averaged 38 
points a game whik pulling down 
15 rebounds each outing. Colleges 
wac already recruiting me and I 
had a couple of calls from some 
pro tcams that I won't mention 
(the ~cw Jersey Nets and the Den-
ver Nuggets) . 

One problem hit me after that 
year 111 high school. 

1 quit growing. 
Right now, 1 am 5' 10". That is 

what I was at the age of 14. All the 
scouts figured I had just started 
growing. 

As it turns out, [ had just fin-
ished. By the time I was 17, my 
shot was still sweet, but I hadn't 
put on any more height. The offers 
quit coming from the COlleges and 
the pros, and I was relegated to the 
playground. 

During the years since my 
demise. I have reflected, and the 
game with my friends made me 
realize something. 

My height is not the problem; 
the problem is the height of the 
basket. 

The hoop is 10 feet from the 
floor, making it so that only the 
tallest of players can participate 
with the most success. Height, 
more than pure skill, is an advan-
tage. 

So, I propose that the NBA 
lower the hoop. Then, playing bas-
ketball at the profeSSional level 
would be open to just about every-
one. 

Lowering the hoop to about 
seven feet Will enable me and those 
like me. those with the mad skills 
but hindered by low growth action. 
can compete. 

The BA's rule of the hoop 
height is blatantly discriminatory. 
It is clearly put at the lO-foot level 
to keep those of small stature from 
playing. Those with the phYSical 
detriment of shortness are being 
denied the glory and the riches of 
playing professional basketball. 
This is not right. 

So, I have submitted a formal 
proposal demanding that the BA 
lower the hoop, therefore giving 
everyone a chance. 

If the NBA does not comply 
with this demand, I am prepared to 
orga nize a class-action lawsuit 
against the organization, suing it 
for dlscnmination. If David Stern 
won't change the rules, perhaps the 
rules can be changed in the courts. 

Ahh, I can see my great career 
coming back to me. I wonder if 
that offer from the Nets is still on 
the table?

Kobe Bryant to Attend UCSD 
Laker superstar focusing on education, 
maki ng the Triton basketbal l squad 

By THOM YORKE 
Staff Writer 

The last couple of years, the 
UCSD men's basketball team has 
had seasons that can be best 
described as forgettable. 

They are soon to get some 
major help. NBA superstar Kobe 
Bryant, currently with the Los 
Angeles Lakers, has announced 
that he plans on continuing his 
education at UCSD this fall and 
has the intention of taking the 
hardcourt as a Triton. 

"Obvio1lsly, if what I hear is 
true. we would be thrilled to have 
him," said UCSD men's basketball 
coach Greg Lanthier. "He is, to say 
the least, an outstanding player." . 

Bryant jumped straight to the 
pros after graduating from Lower 
Marion High School in Pennsyl-
vania, never having attended col-
lege. 

He has taken some courses at 
UCLA during the offseason. but 
still has many quarters yet to com-
plete before he can receive a 
degree. . 

CAA rules state that a player 
who has gone to the professional 
ranks cannot return to play Divi-
sion I college basketball. It does 
not say. however, that a player can-
not return to college to play at the 
Division I! level. 

"I feel that UCSD would be a 
perfect fit for me," Bryant said. "It's 
in a beautiful part of the country, 
near L.A. but not actually in that 
cesspool, and I think that the bas-
ketball team has a lot of potential. 
I look forward~ to working under 

coach Lanthier." 
Bryant will double major, 

working for degrees in general 
biology and computer engineer-
ing. 

He will be attending Marshall 
College, since it is the college clos-
est to RlMAC Arena. 

"My mother and father always 
wanted me to get an education," 
Bryant said. "I guess they were dis-
appointed when I didn't go Ito 
college] right out of high school. I 
hope this makes up for that mis-
take." 

Bryant, 23, wi ll be leaving the 
Lakers after the season is over. He 
has had a successful pro career. 
playing a key role in the Lakers 
championship last year and has 
averaged 29.1 points a game this 
year. 

"He will be missed," said Lak-
ers coach Phil Jackson. "I really 
don't know how we can replace 
him. Hopefully Derek [Fisher] will 
be able to step up or we can get a 
knee transplant fo r Ron IHarper] ." 

Speculation is that Kobe is 
leaving the Lakers to get away 
from fellow superstar Shaquille 
0' eal, with whom Kobe has had 
an ongoing feud over team leader-
ship. 

"The big dog now prowls 
alone, but the big dog is still hun-
gry," O'Neal babbled. "Aristotle 
knows what a big dog is like. The 
little pup has left the house, but I'll 
toss a bone for him when the big 
dog gets full. " 

The Tritons have nowhere to 
go but up after posting a record of 
4-23 for the 2000-2001 season. 

Jack NichOlson/ Guardian 
Gettln' His LeM'll On: Kobe Bryant sports a new pair of glasses he purchased 
especially to assist him in his studies at UCSD. 

"Assuming he makes the team, 
we'll probably bring Bryant off the 
bench during his first year, being 
that he is only a freshman; Lan-
thier said. "He'll probably play the 
two Ishooting guard] and the three 

[small forward] positions." 
Bryant and his family will be vis-
i~ing the campos sometime in May, 
playoffs pending. for a family tour. 

Tryouts and practice for the 
team start in October. 

Athletics to Move Back to Div. III 
After year at Div. II, UCSD to return to old glories, easy wins 
By IMA LUMBERJACK 
Senior Staff Writer 

Yesterday at a press conference, 
the UCS D athletic department 
announced that the school will be 
moving down from Division I! 
back to the Division III level 
beginning with play next fall . 

The announcement comes as a 
bit of a shock. Much work went 
into moving up to Division I! this 
year, and a strong athletic program 
seemed to be the goal. Apparently, 
this has changed. 

The reasoning for this move is 
tha t the Tritons would be more apt 
to win against the lesser competi-
tion . 

"Being that the students are 
highly competitive at UCSD, we 
felt that this move would better fit 
their needs," said UCSD Sports 
Information Director Gill Bannon. 
"This enables the athletic teams 
on campus to seriously contend 
for every national championship 
year in and year out ." 

UCSD is much larger that most 

Division III schools. Back when the 
Tritons formerly competed at the 
Division III level, it was very suc-
cessful. Championships \Io!ere a 
common occurrence. It hopes to 
revisit that success next year. 

Some are murmuring that the 
move down a level is to help those 
teams that did not have very good 
years this year at Division I! to 
compete more successfully. 

"I have no comment about 
t~at," Bannon said. 

Last year, the women's basket-
ball team finished only .500 after 
winning 20 games the previous 
year. The men's basketball team 
struggled for its four wins. Both 
the men's and women's volleyball 
squads have seen better years. 
Other teams had average years 
when, were they in Division II! , 
they would have dominated. 

"Sure, I like this idea of going 
back to Division III," said women's 
basketball coach Mudy lalone. 
"Look at our record this year. 
Look at our competition. Just 
think of the damage we could have 

•.• Midget toss Monday at 7 p.m. at RIMAe Arena 

done playing the likes of Chapman 
and Occidental." 

There were a number of teams 
that did have successful years at 
the Division II level. The women's 
soccer team, for example, won the 
national championship. Still, the 
squad is looking forward to the 
change. 

"We should be able to kick 
everyone's ass," said TI-iton goal 
keeper Paki Kama. "We rocked the 
best schools at the Division II level 
last year. You couldn't stop us, 
only pray to contain us. Against 
Division III , there would be no 
reason to even show up for' the 
first half. We could sit out the first 
half, show up in the second, and 
still spank those fools." 

"This will give us an opportu-
nity to try new things," said UCSD 
women's soccer head coach Ryan 
McDonald. "We can mix it up a 
little. Perhaps put some children 
on the field. I am sure that they 
can hang. It's never too early to get 
started." 

The men's soccer team made 

the playoffs this year at Division II, 
but the possibilities if they had 
been at a lower level were limitless. 

"That damn championship 
would have been ours," said men's 
soccer head coach Derek Leg-
weak. "[Babbi] Saadati would have 
cleaned up. I can't wait for next 
year. We'll hoist that trophy yet." 

The move does not affect a 
number of teams, including water 
polo, track and field, and swim-
ming, who play in open divisions. 

"Those other guys are weak," 
.said tmck and field head coach 
Sony Talerno. · We go against the 
best around every day. Now they 
get to play the likes of Redlands all 
the time? Give me a break. The'y 
are all ... pussys. TI-ack and field is 
where it's at." 

The move down is very differ-
ent than the 1Il0ve up. Much 
preparation is needed to move up, 
but to move down, it can happen 
within the next year. 

"I feel that this is the best step 
for the university; said Triton 
Athletic Director Erie Edwardo.
