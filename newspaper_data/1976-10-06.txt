Varga Finds 
Inspiration 
In Stud"ents 

by Laura Richter 
Staff Writer 

Self-described al "hyper," new 
Third College Dean Beverly 
Varga expI'eues a vitality which 
may ouUast that of her fellow 
administrators. She admits her 
persistence has some people 
"climbing the walls," although 
much of the criticism has 
disappeared since she gained her 
new title. 

In fact, she says her staff has 
strongly supported her during her 
brief tenure. When she was 30, 
and the mother cI. four children, 
Varga set out to complete her 
college education as a means of 
escape from daytime television 
and the routine of being a 
housewife. She was greatly in-
spired by the acceptance she 
received from her fellow students 
and became active in the anti-war 
uprisings of the sixties. 

Her first two years of college 
were spent at Mesa Community 
College in San Diego. She then 
transferred to California Western 
University, as a psychology 
major. Her work was

done in counseling, at San. Diego 
State University. 

CoUege Is "trabdDg grouad" 
Varga views Tbird College as a 

"training ground" for' students of 
all races and backgrounds. She 
believes the college should , aim at 

pro~ucing fully-qualified pro-
fesslOnals who have developed 
a cultural awareness and local 
consciousness during their years 
at Third. A strong feeling of 
committment helping students 
pursue these goals is emphasized 
In the Varga administration 
philosophy. 

In the eyes cI. the new Dean 
!bird is still young enough to ~ 
Innovative in establishing 
traditions that will have meaning 
for the diverse interesta cI. its 
stUdents. She is greatly inspired 
Over the prospect of influencing 
the lives and directions of 
stUdents with this positive ap-
proach.

Funding Controversy 
'resolved by ~Murphy 

A final controversy over last 
year's student disciplinary 
hearings seems to have been 
resolved last week when funding 
for the proceedings was switched 
from Registration Fee monies to 
state funds. 

The total costs for the-hearings-
-excluding expenditures for 
salaries of administrators and 
campus police involved--was 
$8688.42, according to a budget 
prepared by the ' Student Affairs 
office. Of that, $4688.42 was 
funded from state monies 
allocated for the Student Affairs 
Supply and Expense budget. The 
rest was paid for after a directive 
from Chancellor McElroy shifted 
$4000 cI. Student Affairs budget 
savings to cover hearings costs. 

SbUt from Reg Fee 
Originally, however, the entire 

cost for the hearings-which were 
held to detennine the guilt or 
innocence of 10 U~D students 
charged in connection with a Nov. 
25, 1975 demonstration over the 
CIA-was borne by student Reg 
Fee monies. Not until the entire 
costs were detennined was the 
funding shifted to state funds by 
Vice-chancellor and Dean of 
student Affairs George Murphy. 

According t9 AM Carberry, a 
student member of the Advisory 
Committee on Student Fee 
Programs (which advises the 
Chancellor on uses for student 
monies), Murphy said the use of 
Reg Fee funds for the hearings 
was a mistake. 

According to Murphy, Reg Fee 
funds were used to cover the 
expenses until the final cost was 
known. At this point, the cost was 
transferred to state funds. 

(Murphy said he requested the 
Chancellor cover ~ of the cost, 
becaUle Studem Aftain did not 
have sufficient funds to meet the 
total cost.) 

Carberry, in an interview last 
week, said the shift from Reg Fee 
to state funds wu .cademic, 
since both money-lOllJ'ces come 
from the Res Fee committee's 
budget. 

"Identifiable" Costs 
Murphy specified that the 

$8688.42 figure was for costs 
"identifiable in my office." Not 
included in the hearings budget 
were expenditures for the salaries 
for administrators who worked at 
or appeared in the proceedings, 
the UC attorney who represented 
the university or the police of-

fi~rs who were transferred from 
the other UC campuses for the 
hearings. 

Transcripts of each day's 
proceedings constituted the bulk 
of the cost, $7671.48 or almost 90 
percent of the total. The rest was 
divided between graphic arts 
services, audio visual equipment, 
use of facilities, food services and 
parking permits. 

The issue of who should fund 
the hearings is part of a larger 
issue over the funding for any 
disciplinary action. At UC, 
students pay a IJ,eg Fee for 
student services that are outside 
the J'essential" workings of the 
educational process. Carberry said 
this means Reg. Fee money should 
not be used for disciplinary ac-
tions, since "Students don't want 
discipline" and it is essential to the 
educational process. 

Murphy said' Monday that he 
shifted funding for the hearings 
from Reg Fee to state monies 
because he believes students 
should not have to pay for 
disciplinary actions. 

IISIDE THE TT 
f'or yean, tudeata have gone 

to coUege with the help of money 
from the federal governmenl 
Now, however, after lending " 
billion to over 4.5 million students, 
the government is pulling back on 
its guaranteed student loaM. 
Factors responsible for this 
development Include a rising 
default rate and greedy ad-
ministrators. A story on this

Speck Found Guilty 
of Interest ·Conflict by A & E 

By Marlene Herman 
and Paul Watry 

The question of External Affairs 
Coordinator Fred Speck's possible 
conflict of interests in forming a 
Task Force that investigated 
alternate forms of student 
government at UCSD was 
discussed in last Friday's 
Appointment and Evaluations 
meeting. 

On Monday it was announced 
that Speck was indeed guilty of 
the conflict of interests claim. 

In reaching this decision it was 
seen that Speck had acted in an ' 
improper manner by not in-
forming the Coop of his task force 
while still maintaining his post on 
External Affairs, a Coop support 
group. Additionally J it was 
suggested that Speck's position on 
the Coop enabled him to obtain 
money to institute the task force. 

Speck defended himself by 
testifying that his activities could 
not be construed as a conflict of 
interest, saying "I only wished to 
expand the capacity of the UCSD 
student government to serve the 
students." Speck also stated that 
the work on the task force was of 
his own intiative, and did not 
involve the Coop. "I never meant 
to undennine the Coop," he said. 
"I stayed on in the winter quarter 
and if I had meant to undermine 
the' Coop, I would have done it in 
another way." 

Since the Coop has not been 
officially adopted as the student 
government of UCSD, Speck 

contended that presenting 
alternative student governments 
on a referendum brought to the 
students would give the students 
more choice and therefore more 
say, in their own government. 

Additionally, he argued that the 
Coop should not feel any hostility 
towards the task force, and said, 
"I asswne a cooperative would 
accept a referendum with more 
than one form of government. It 
would make the Coop stronger 
because it would challenge the 
Coop with other forms of 
government." 

In response to why he did not 
tell the Coop of his proposals, 
Speck admitted that he had 
erred. "It was a mistake not to 
mention the task force at the Coop 
meetings," he said. 

After some debate , the 
discussion shifted to the External 
Affairs Committee . Internal 
conflicts arose when Andy 
Schneider was chosen as surruner 
coordinator of External Affairs 
under the newly amended UCSD 
constitution. Under the old con-
stitution.. four c<H:oordinators 
represented External Affairs. 
Now, under the new amendment, 
only one coordinator exists. 
Should Co-Coordinators Decide? 
Acting as a representative for 

the fonner External Affairs c~ 
coordinators, Speck ulquired into 
the legitimacy of Schneider's role 
as chainnan in the newly formed 
committee. In a written statement 
given to the Appointments and

KSOT Determined to stay 
despite Financial Crisis 

by Richard Watts 

Staff Writer 

UC San Diego's radio station, 
KSDT, bas been plagued by a 
history of poor management 
financial problems, and most 
consequentially insufficient 
broadcast power for reaching the 
campus it was designed to serve. It 
takes a clear reception day and a 
bit of luck to receive the station 
even in the Revelle donns. 

As a result, KSDT has recently 
had its ten-thousand dollar per 
year budget tenninated, an act of 
the Registration Fee Committee. 
Under such circumstances one 
might expect the station to be 
playing 'taps' as its nwnber one 
song very soon. 

Such a defeat is not in the plans 
of Ralph Hawkins, the newly 
appointed station manager. Ralph 
maintains an impressive history 
of experience including three 
years with station KUCI of UC 
Irvine and a year as head of the 
"National College Promotion" for 
United Artists.

Even though Hawkins has 

inherited the financial burden 
created by the Reg Fee Com-
mittee's zero budget, he has

ANONYMOUS 

Christianity Clarified 
Ran Anbar's remarks in last 

Wednesday's TT on the "an-
swers" which Christianity gives 
to a believer reflect a rather 
profound misunderstanding of the 
fundamentals of the Christian 
faith. 

Mr. Anbar says that, according 
to Christianity, " man's purpose 
on Earth is for God to know and it 
isn't really up to us to think about 
it." Christ and his followers never 
said anything of the sort. The 
very first question in the West-
minster Shorter Catechism, an 
expression of faith used in 
Engllsh-speaking countries since 
1647, is " what is the chief end of 
man? " The answer given is 
"man's chief end is to glorify 
God, and to enjoy Him forever." 

That this question begins the 
catechism indicates that 
Christians :i~ and should "think 
about it. " fie are called to 
respond to 34d's gift of love with 
our own gIP. !I love - and to make 
this respolls ls the fundamental 
reason we li~ here. 

H Chrlsiatlity Is true, thell 
Christ's tlT'ms on men and 
women ar. beolute. And if Hls 
claims an absolute, then "to 

glorlf~ Go and enjoy him 
forever' is more than a com-
mandment - it ls an expression of 
man's purpose on earth. "You 
shall love the Lord your God ... 
and your neighbor as yourself" Is 
not merely good advice or even a 
fundamental law - it tells us what 
we are here for. 

Mr. Anhar also seems to 
misunderstand Christian hope. It 
is untrue that " we can hope to do 
well at following Christ's 
teachings;" we have no such 

hope, for we will aU fall short of 
adequate obedience to His will. 

What gives the Christian hope is 
not that he can make himself like 
Christ; rather it is that God 
grants him forgiveness for his 
sins and weaknesses and thereby 
redeems him from the bondage of 
sin and death . Redemption, not 
good behavior, is the basis of the 
Christian's hope. 

Mr. Anbar is certainly entitled 
to his own ideas and to his own 
ways of arriving at them. But I 
hope that if he rejects Christianlty 
he will do so only after evaluating 
what it really says. And I hope 
that Christians will make a 
greater effort to express the 
Gospel clearly, to give people like 
Mr. Anbar an opportunity to 
understand and evaluate it.

Functions of Student Coop Defined 
by Alldy lkh ........ 

Coop SlllIewII1e Extenm 
Aft ..... CoontIDa&oDr 

How do I tell you bow much I 
have learned front working witbln 
the student Cooperative Unlon? 
Both critics and thOle who would 
attempt to evaluate the Coop are 
missing the poinl The founders of 
the Coop carefully eumlned what 
outcomes should be produced by a 
student governance structure. 
These goals lncluded political 
advocacy for student concerns 
and a new awareness of the value 
of student conununlty. 

The Coop was not designed to 
be a traditional government. 
Colleges and universities all 
across the country are coming to 
the realization that structures 
baaed upon the national federal 
govenment do not fuHlll the 
needs of students. 

Having a president, senate and 
judiciary may be a poUtical 
science learning experience, but 
students on the whole do not 
govern. 

It ls the national nonn that 
stUdent government has become a 
play toy used to satisfy lndiVldual 
ego and used to avoid conflict 
with distracting social activities. 
Issues are endlessly dlscussed, 
fees are allocated, and students 
are consumed with trivial 
bureaucratic functions. In what 
capacity do the students serve to 

affect tbe 1cwa'D8Dce IIructure of 
the Unlveralty! Where is the 
dlrect input bU tbe decIaio& 
makiIIg procea wldcb affecta the 
lives <if students? 

During the 1980's, students 
protested the inadequacies of a 
multiunlverslty which had in-
creased in size and academic 
stature, but had failed to meet 
Individual personal needs. In 1964, 
the studenta of UC Berkeley 
revolted as the free speech 
movement pushed for the right to 
maintain political advocacy on 
campa. The Unlversity was 
forced to accept the reality that 
stude. had won, and the need 
for greater student participation 
in government had been 
establisbed. 

What had happened to thls 
change? '!be revolution has been 
institutionaHled. Student 
bureaucracies have taken over. 
Governments on other campuses 
house skyscrapers full of junior 
executives eagerly maiJUinlng 
the status quo and their jobs. It 
almost seems that there is at 
least one student member on 
every committee which makes the 
system function. But how much 
influence do these students really 
have? Participation or playtime? 

Because of our hlstorica1 and 
social development, UC San 
Diego's campus communlty Is 
divided into numerous diverse 
se~ments. No central government 

Don't Encourage Them-Vote 
"Pro" on "Crastination" 

by Daniel Lee Shawler 

The old politician Un D. Sided 
has been enjoying a surge of 
popularity unparalleled in his 
career. He won a couple of 
Democratic presidential 
primaries, he captured a 
congressional seat in Nevada, and 
he continues to make respectable 
showings in the latest polls. 

Why the sudden surge? The last 
time he ran for president, in 1972, 
he did very poorly. What are the 
reasons behind hls increase in 
popularity? 

Confusion. 
America is growing weary of 

dull peanut farmers, men who 
cannot chew gum and smile 
simultaneously, men who a~ 
vocate "boating, not busslng," 
and bleeding hearts that suffered 
thrombosis In 1968. Un D. Sided 
represents everythlng these men 
are not. HIs dynamlcism promises 
to lead America to a new and 
eulted position in world 
leadership. Rumor has It that he 
will appoint his dlstant COIIIIn Un

first act will be a Pepsi emb!u'go

servative! This was the same 
man who c()osponsored the 
socialistic food stamp bill with the 
Infamous loser of the 1972 elec-
tion. 

It should appear obvious why 
America needs Un D. Sided. Just 
remember his campaign slogan

"Don't vote, it only encourages

One alternative is an 
authoritarian, bierarchial, super-
power structure wblch attempts 
legitimation through election and 
controls by privilege, tradition, 
funding. UC San Diego choIe to be 
different. '!be Coop was designed 
to respect individual dignity 
through • equal treatmelt and 
recognize the I*grity of student 
groups. Rathel' than ru1e, the 
Student Cooperative Unlon leeks 
to reflect tbe will and serve as a 
representative umbrella for all 
students who wish to join in 
common causes. 

'!be Student <;oopenUve Union

maximum openess wbleh gives 
stude. the opportunity to make 
a personal commitment - a share

a share of tbe responsibility. 

I submit to you that legitimacy 
gained through election where few 
care and a few rule ls far Inferior 
to a cooperative whicb allows aU 
students to vote. 

We bave become so highly 
sensitized to bureaucracy we 
seem to forget that the Student

board of directors, and the

other schools have just begun to 
examine. We are not only unlque, 
but stand alone In creative in-
novation. The success or faUure of 
the Coop will Influence the course 
of the national student movement. 

I will admit upfront that In 
some areas the Coop has failed. 
Did anyone think to check that the 
reason Is not In an alternative 
structure, but In the fact that 
traditional structures produce the 
same problems?

Mfalrs coordinators were elected, 
he was a legitimate summer 
coordinator. He requested that he 
should still be part fA. External 
Mfalrs. 

In a written testimony, 
Schneider documented examples 
of bis participatlon and 
quaUfications of being summer 
coordinator of the new support 
group. In addition, he made 
several recommendations to the 
Appointments and Evaluations 
cunmittee on deciding the future 
of the External Affairs c0m-
mittee. 

Appointments and Evaluatlons 
ruled Monday that a referendum 
would be he14 soon to establish a 
new form for the External Affairs 
committee_ 

Varga .• 
Wednesdays as " sacred" so 
students can come in and speak 
with her personally. 

Varga strl;lsses that " com-
munity building" will be a 
predominant theme in the 
development of Third College. She 
asks that the faculty, staff and 
students join forces to attain the 
goals they have set forth together. 

Hawkins has high hopes that the 
near future will hoid a l~watt FM 
license for KSDT. When correctly 
matched with the proposed an-
tenna either atop the Muir 
Campus's Applies Physics and 
Mathematics buUdlng or on UCSD 
property at Mt. -Soledad, the 
range fA. the station will Increase 
to approJ:imately ten miles. 

Most Powerful Statloo 
At the moment, however, 

KSDT's sights are on obtaining 
the frequency of San Diego's 
KDlG, which is currently faced 
with the possibility of losing its 
50,000 waU license. This would 
make UCSD the owner of San 
Diego's most powerful radio 
station. "Such licenses are being 
issued to college stations all over 
the country," Hawkins noted. "In 
fact, UCSD has a better chance of 
receiving the license because we 
are a non-commercial radio 
station, whereas other applicants 
are commercial In great numb-
bers". 

KSDT will feature progressive 
rock, j8JZ, talk shows, live music, 
and special shows of classical and 
Latino music. 

The station's first promotion 
concert will be held October 10th 
at 8:00 in the Mandeville Center 
featuring Bob Long and His 
Billion Dollar Band; donation $1. 

Ralph Hawkins appears to have 
hard times ahead in trying to 
maneuver the station through 
narrow budgeting. He hopes, and 
many students join him in that 
hope, that the station won't have 
to sign off forever.

Notebook 

Dave Eisen 
A Vintage Year 

It was 1973, a very good year. 
Under coach Han Rothmuller, UCSD's soccer team upset San Diego 

State. Rothmuller left the team at the end of the season to pursue other 
interests. 

The Tritons haven't beaten the Aztecs since. 
Rotbmuller is back this season, and he brings his team into Aztec 

Bowl Saturday afternoon to renew the intnH:lty rivalry. . 
It will be the second and final match of UCSO's preseason, after 

hosting Point Loma on Muir Field tomorrow afternoon. 
The Tritons were within rninptes of upsetting State last year, losing 

3-2 on a late goal. The two UCSD scorers that day, Jairo Marin and 
Dave Youngdale, will be in uniform tomorrow. 

Saturday's battle presents possibly the best chance of any UCSD 
team to defeat the Aztecs this year. 

" They're ususlly very good," said returning Rothmuller. " They have 
coach (George Logan) and he manages to get most' of the local 
" 

Brion Healy takes a diue [IT photo: Chris Sherman] 
Rothmuller is more worried about his own team than State, however. 
Dave Youngdale (ankle) and Alfonso Gonzales (foot ) are both in-

jured, and are questionable starters. A freshman, Brian Healy, will 
start in gOlil, and he is expected to get some experience in a hurry. 

In front of Healy on defense will be, among others, returnee Al 
Turken, one of the team's hardest workers, and 6' 5" John Kolenda. 

One non-league game has been added to the middle of UCSD's 
schedule· a Nov. 6 game at Tijuana Tech. It should be interesting ... 

And it looks professionaL. 
Cindy Goeddel strolled out to Muir ,Field Friday, scene of the first 

Sports Bizarre, to find out about the crew team. 
Not long after she had proved herself to be UCSD's best aU-around 

athlete by winning the Bizaare competition that included 13 different 
scores in the baseball, crew, field hockey, swimming and volleyball 
events, and coming close in the others. 

Morgan Nagid ended up second with 48 points, and Mike Shand and 
Jon Gerdsen had 47. 

"It was really a success," an intercollegiate spokesperson said of the 
Bizarre. " The turn-out was excellent, we had a lot of sponsors with 
prizes, and everyone had fun." ... 

UCSD has been chosen for the site of All-Cal events this year in 
soccer, women's tennis and badminton. 

Every UC school shows up for neai'ly every All·Cal competition 
nearly every year - with the exception of UCLA. The Bruins, ap-
parently, are in a class by themselvel!.

Flag Football Kicks off Season 
By RoIIKato 
Staff Writer 

The 1971 intramursl football 
season will kickoff this Saturday 
with last year's champions from 
both divisions (men's and coed) 
returing to defend their tiU •. 

Back for another year of 
competition will be the team .from 
Scripps Institution, formerly 
recognized as the Sons of Ellen 
Browning, the champions from a 
year ago. In the coed divlaion, the 
team to beat will be the defending 
champs Prehensile Wangers, 
captalried by Frank Vernon, 
competing this year as the 
Rougbriders. 

A new playoff fonnat will be 
instituted this season to ac-
conunodate more teams in p0st-
season play. Each league will 
carry only six teams and the top 
three will advance into the 
playoffs. The playoffs thla year 

Coop ... 
The Student Cooperative 

proposal forewarned that the only 
thing that could hurt the Coop is 
the egotistical and selfish con-
cerns of its own potential mem-
bership. The bias cl students to 
only be aware of the benefits and 
detriments to their personal -
welfare is a syndrome which runs 
counter to a cooperative-type 
philosophy. In a cooperative 
system everyone must give a 
little of him or herself in order 
that this soclally-created ex-
tension Qf human energies can 
produce the innQVations it should 
produce. 

U the Student Cooperative fails, 
we all fail as individuals. We will 
have proven that we're not willing 
to care enough about others to 
form a working community. 
Please don' t let it happen. 

From my involvement with the 
Student Coop Union, I have 
learned to approach government 
with a different perspective. I 
have learned what it means to 
grow together by sharing, rather 
than ruling through organization. 
I have learned what it mf'.ans to 
rush a part of yourself in hopes of 
improving the quality of com-
munity life.

. Rule modifications have also

lowered to encourage more

will only be six players from each team of the field.

Stewart's singing stretches itself 
to the limit , the result sounding 
like a prelude to a toilet l: wi 
8Oilloquy. The ballads, in turn, 
are handled with skill and grace, 
with Stewart applying the 
remains of hla cancerous rasp 
judiciously over the otherwise 
sentimental clap trap of the 
lyrics. Though he can 't rock 
anymore, he is well on the way to 
becoming our generation's Tony 
BeMett, which is more of a 
compliment than most razor 
throated crooners deserve. 

Bolt..BOIton [Reprise 1 
Boltoa, name of band and debut 

album, is a hodgepodge of licks 
that most of us have heard 
elsewhere. A careful listening 
reveais borrowings from The 
Who, Zep, Mott the Hoople, 
Bowie, and Velvet Underground. 
The band, thouah, has POtential to 
go beyond this initial derivation. 
Guitarist Tom Scholz has taste 
and technique, and shows a 
deUcious predilection for multiple 
tone usage like Queen's Brian 
May. Singer Barnaby Delps has 
tremendous rage and feeling, able 
to sing softly like Felix Papalardi 
(Mountain) or belt it out as 
powerfully as David Coverdale 
(Deep Purple ). With better 
material. Boston could become 
the best band in America. But 
let's not put our hopes too high. 

Ragtime Pianist Long Here 
English super-rockers The Who will perform in concert tomorrow at 

the San Diego Sports Arena. One of several groups purporting 'to be 
greatest' rock and roll band in the world, The Who is paced by 

Townshend on guitar, Roger Daltrey on vocals, Keith Moon on 
and J ohn Entwhistle on bass. 

The Who 
RagUme at tbe Mandeville 

Ragtime pianist Bob Long will headline a concert Sunday, October 
10 at the Mandeville Center. Winner of the Scott Joplin competition in 
1973, Long is a musician of considerable talent and versatility. 
Appearing with Long will be two fine local bands, Grace and 
Harlequin. 

Tokyo String Quartet 
The internationally celebrated Tokyo String Quartet will perform at 

uam Friday. The quartet is affiliated with the American University 
in Washington, D.C., and plays 300-year-old Arnati instruments on 
loan from the Corcoran Gallery. Their program will include " Quartet 
in B flat Major, Op. 50, No. I " by Haydn, "Quartet No.4" by Bartok 
and in C Major, Op. -59, No. 3" Beethoven.

I '. Guar nteed Student Loan Program In "Hewge" Trouble 
I 

by HehlDe Lasky 
(CPS) - St-udents who think 

Uncle Sam will etemally play 
sugar daddy bl;.ve something new 
to consider. After lending a 
whopping $8 billion to more than 
U million students in ten years, 
the federal government is pulling 
in the reins on federally 
guaranteed student loans. 

The overall student loan default 
rate has climbed to 15.6 percent. 
As another way out of financial 
distress, many students choose to 
go through the administrative

mechanism of bankruptcy. In 1975 
nearly 4000 students took this 
route. Because students are given 
incomplete information about 
their loans, they must come to 
sudden gripe with what once 
seemed Uke the never-never land 
of repayment schedules u soon 
aa 120 days after graduation. 
Financial aid officers often draw 
up the terms of the loan 
agreement with little con-
sideration for a student's financial 
status immediately following 
graduation, when the student is 
confronted with a poor job market 
and forced to meet loan 
repayments simultaneously. 

The loan program has also 
fallen prey to greedy ad-
ministrators. In one San Fran-
cisco cue, an HEW official was 
paid "tens of thousands of dollars 
in cash," to help a private school 
owner obtain federal funds, ae-

cording to Senate Permanant , 
Investigation subcommittee in-
fonnation in November of 1975. 
The official later resigned after 
receiving nearly $3),000 in the 
form of consultation fees~ 

Students have alBo been 
victimized by proftt-maldni iJI.. 
stitutions and private sChools 
which ' sometimes close before the 
students graduate. The student is 
left holding the bill, and is liable 
to repay his federal loans 
anyway. 

For students who already have 
federally insured loans, and are 
unable to repay .them, the 
govenunent has collection plans 
to get their money back. In 1974, 
HEW enlisted the services of 135 
collectors to crack down on

defaults. If a student has a 
delinquent loan, he or she can 
expect a letter in the mall. If this 
doesn't work, the student wW be 

contacted by telephone. In fact, 
HEW consulted the telephone 
company to assist in training a 
corps of collectors. The phone 
companies have been studying 
ways to save money for HEW in 
their phone campaigns. 

H the collector determines that 
the student is capable of paying 
but simply won't, the file is sent 
to the Department of Justice. The 
collector obtains the information 
from the student directly or from 
outside credit services, and the 
credit service delivers an assets 
report on the student. Despite the 
increase in student default and 
bankruptcy rates, a source at HEW 
maintained that no drastic 
meuures have been taken to 
collect payments. That was not 
enough, however, to deter four 
HEW collectors in Dallas from 
posing as FBI agents and other 
law-enforcement officers to force 
students to pay off loans, although 
these officials were later brought 

before a Dallas court facing 
charges of misrepresentation. 

Universities have also tried to 
collect loan money due them. At 
the University of Southern 
California, alllChool records of the 
defaulting stude .. are clO8ed, and 
readmission is barred until the 
loan ' is repaid. 1be Unlvel'Jity 
claims that this system has been 
"100 percent" effective. 

Even Congress tried to get into 
the act to resolve the situation. A 
Student Peer Counseling Amend-
ment was introduced in the 
Senate by Senator Jacob Javits (R-
NY), but on the day it wu to have 
been considered by Congress, 
Javits was abeent. The amend-
ment which would have provided 
that college students accompany 
financial aid officers and college 
recruiters on their visits to high 
schoolB, wu deleted in less than a 
minute. 

Considering the history of the 
federally-insured student loan 
program, it would seem advisable 
for a student considering a loan to 
have a . lawyer first examine the 
loan agreement to prevent the 
student from buying a lemon.
