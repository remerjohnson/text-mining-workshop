Question Off Ballot 
Did Jenkel Remove It Without Proper Authority? 

By Jeff Beresford-H0l,Ye 
A'lIlOeiate Manarln, Edilor 

UCSD students will not get a 
chance to vote this week on 
whether the Board of Regents 
should be democratically 
elected because AS President 
John Jenkel removed a 
question to that effect from the 
election ballot, two members of 
the AS Council say. 

Both External Af£airs 
Commissioner Jim Lofgren 
and Elections Commissioner 
Phil GJlnezer say Jenkel 
removed the question from the 
ballot because he thought it 
redundant with another 
question on the ballot, although 
Lofgren and Ganezer disagree 

as to the legality of Jenkel's 
move . 

Lofgren charges that Jenkel 
" intentionally abused" his 
authority in removing the 
question, saying that Jenkel 
acted after checking a copy of 
the AS constitution, then telling 
Ganezer that he had line-item 
veto power over the refer-
endum questions. 

Jenkel says he did discuss the 
question with Ganezer, and 
thought it "redundant," but 
says he never went beyond the 
discussion level. 

"Ou r discussion somehow got 
transformed into an impera-
tive .. . Ganezer deleted it on the 
basis of our discussion. The 

Ruling Against 
Bekken 'Unfair' 

By Ka,hy Huffer 
Associate News Editor 

Unfair procedures were used 
in the Election Board's ruling of 
a campaign violation against 
,Jon Bekken , candidate for next 
year ' s Commissioner of 
Student Welfare position , 
according to a memo dis-
tributed yesterday from the 
Student Affairs Office. 

Bekken, who did not a ppea r 
for a Judicia l Board review of 
hi s a lleged violation ye te rday, 
was not a fforded "adequate 
due proce s" in his a ppeal of 
la t week's ru ling, according to 
Vice hancellor of Student 

ffair Ri hard Armitage and 
tudent Organizntion d i or 

Handy Woodard. 
Bekken was found guilty of a 

campCl ign violation la.' t we k 

for using an unauthorized 
typesetting machine for 
campaign purposes. He then 
appealed to the Judicial Board 
to review the ruling. 

Because of transportation 
difficulties , Bekken was unable 
to attend the 7 pm board 
meeting, he said. The board 
upheld the previous ruling of a 
cl:lmpaign violation. 

" He receive d fair treat-
ment," commented Judicia l 
Board member Greg Griffin , 
"Jon was a dvi se d o{ th e 
meeting. When he arrived, we 
wer writi ng out our opinion 
and ou r quorum wa gone." 

Armitag, · aid he ordinarily 
wouldn't g t involved in 
campaign pro dures b cau c 
stud 'nt "shou ld police th ir 

(PIc'asl' turn to pagl' ;}) 

whole thing is a big mistake, a 
misunderstanding. 

" If I had removed the 
question, it would have been 
illegal. But I didn't remove it, " 
Jenkel says. 

The AS constitution gives the 
president line-item~ veto power 
over finanlcal legislation, but 
"common veto" power over all 
other legislation. 

Ganezer, though, says Jenkel 
does have authority over the 
ballot under a constitutional 
provision giving Jenkel 
,. control" over the election, but 
he does say that it was on 
Jenkel's authority that the 
question was removed. 

Lofgren also says that he and 
Jenkel went to Student Welfare 
Commissioner Barry Hyman, 
the bill 's sponsor when it 
passed the Council 11-1 two 
weeks ago, and Jenkel told 
Hyman that he had to cut out 
pa rt of the question, e ither the 
first part (which is still on 
today 's ballot) or the second, 
which asked UCSD students 
whether the Regents should be 
s elected in some way other than 
appointment by the governor. 

" He told me he had line-item 
veto power over the bill , a nd 
would do what he wanted with it 
if I didn 't ('hoo e one, so I chose 
to delete the second part," 
Hyman says ,

59 Now Suing UC to Stop Use 
Of Fees for Abortion Cover.age 

By AlilOn Han 
Staff Writer 

Six UCSD students got the 
right yesterday to add their 
names to legal protests against 
using registration fees to pay 
for campus health plans which 
have mandatory abortion 
coverage. 

Twenty-seven students at 
severa l UC campuses were also 
a dded , m a king the total 
number of plaintiffs in the suit 
59, including 21 here. 

In addition, the new plaintiffs 
we re r e insta te d in th ei r 
clas es, which we re cancelled 
Thursday. Their registration 
fees ha ve joined those of the 
other plaintiffs in a court trust. 

Until the June, 1980 trial , the 
registration fees will be held by 
the court. If the students win, 
part of their fees will be 
rebated . If they lose, the 
university will get the money. 

The decision to allow the 
plaintiffs to join the suit was to 
be made yesterday morning in 
court, but attorneys for both 
sides agreed Monday to settle 
out of court. 

Still, the estimated $25,000 in 
legal costs the plaintiffs will 
have to pay has aroused anger 
at UC legal strategy . 

Anne Fox, one of those added 
to the suit, says UC attorneys 
are "using scare tactics," then 
at the last moment backing 
away from legal skirmishes. 
" They know the delay is better 
for them," she says. 

The suit has been gaining 
force since its inception more 
than a year ago . . 

The original suit was brought 
against American National 
Financial Corporation, which 
handled the student health 
insurance. Blue Cross now 
covers students ,· inc luding 
elective abortions up to $150, if 
the pregnancy occurs during 
the coverage period . Sharon 
Keating of the UCSD health 
center estimates th a t she ha 
referred about 140 students for 
abortions since last July. 

Approximately 90 of these 
students collected their Blue 
Cross insu~ance for the 

procedure . Others didn't. 
qualify or paid for the abortion 
with family insurance, she 
said. 

Albin Rhomberg, one of the 
original portesters, now a 
graduate student in the APIS 
department, opposes the use of 
registration fees for abortion 
because " abortion on demand 
is not a part of education." 

He is sympathetic to the 
woman students, he says, and 
feels " males have to have 
responsibility . Abortion on 
demand lets a man slip out 
e ntir e ly . " He considers 
elective . abortions socially

Third's 
Program 
Toughenea 

By Ka'hy Huff~r 
Associate New. Editor 

An amendment to Third 
College 's general education 
requirements was passed 
overwhelmingly yesterday by 
the Academic Senate, cul-
minating nearly a year's effort 
by Third to expand the writing 
education of its students. 

Effective next year, the GE 
amendment requires Third 
students to fulfill an additional 
course in writing, revising the 
present set of requirements 
from one to two quarters. 

The senate approved the 
revision by voice vote after 
hearing a brief presentation by 
Third College Provost Joseph 
Watson. The amendment met 
with little faculty opposition, 
a ccording to Lynne Harris, 
senate coordinator. 

The new requirement will not 
apply to current Third students 
unless they choose to comply 
with the a mendment, Watson 
sa id. Next year's catalogue, 
which has been printed 
already, includes the additional 
requirement in its description 
of Third, according to Watson ,

Y'oting 

Today and tomorrow students will have a chance to do 
somethiJli for themselves, the student body, as a whole. 
They can let out and vote in the AS elections. 

Studen .. on this campus have no real 'Student center, 
attrition here 11 bieber than Ram DaBS and Timothy Leary 
l.'OI1lbined, the administration can basically do anything it 
wants to and, except in those cases where students 
mobilized en masse it has. 

There is nothing that would shake the administration and 
give power to the students more than a high turnout in the 
elections. The AS is now two years old and is gaining 
legitimacy and experience. With a vote of confidence, as 
evidenced by a mass turnout of students at the polls, the AS 
will have the solid base of support necessary to transfonn 
that lqitimaey and experience iato a myriad of tangible 
returns on the studen'" investmen ... 

Some 88y even a high turnout won't accomplish anything 
becauae the administration is too powerful. But last year 
wben the admini.tration decided to kill the Daycare Center 
studen .. tumed out and stopped the decision. This year 
when the administration ripped off vending machine funds 
aDd tried to Ule them to cover up for shoddy management in 
Food and HOOIing Services they were again stopped by the 
coordinated and committed actions of students. 

Our feeliqs can make a difference. And the best way to 
assure that they do is to vote today and tomorrow in the 
Associated Students eleCtions. .

Editor: 

We support Carlos Montalvo, 
Nancy Laga, Olivier Kolpin and 
Linda Sabo for many reasons. 
Tbey have done a lot for UCSD, 
and we want them to continue. 
Nancy and Carlos coordinated 
the Vending and Coffee Hut 
issues to successfully retain 
them on the students' behalf. 
Linda and Olivier brought the 
legislature here last fall to 
investigate tenure and inter-
disciplinary program cuts. 
Each worked extensively on 
clarifying and promoting the 
Daycare issue. What's more, 
they've followed through these 
and many other student 
concerns with action rather 
than idle mention or alienating 
threats. 

Issues are often complex, and 
so require stamina and 
commitment to develop and 
resolve them. Montalvo, Laga, 
Kolpin and Sabo have these 
necessary qualities as well as 
the integrity to deal positively 
and rationally in the student 
welfare. They do not heatedly 
attack " the opposition" or 
nebulous issues, and instead 
are equitable, reaaonable' and 
assertive in questioning ' 

authority and tangibly seeking 
realistic resolutions. Each has 
reached out to involve students, 
ol'lanizations and the colleges 
to work both (or and with them, 
not selectively with an isolated 
few. 

Montalvo, Laga. Kolpin and 
Sabo have utilized viable 
resources, and have thereby 
become enthusiastic resources 
with the expertise to reach out 
and cooperate with students 
and community. They have and 
will support and expand 
student organizations such as 
the Food, Print and Dike Co-
ops, much needed Housing Co-
ops and the development of 
departmental organizations to 
bring students and facuJtyback 
together.

Thousands of Expatriate 
Draft Dodgers Forgotten 
Vietnam War Resisters Remain Suspicious of US 

With Congress seriously considering resumption 
of the draft, a new generation of peace protesters 
awaits the government's call. Some of these new 
protesters, no doubt , will choose to leave the Uniled 
Stales and settle in Canada, where they would join 
those who fled during the last period of the draft . 
Associated Press wriler Charles Hanley examines 
how it is (or those Jiving in Canada now. 

By Charles Hanley 

S ix years after U.S. guns fell silent in Vietnam, a lost battalion of American draft dodgers grows older, more 
Canadian and perhaps wiser in Toronto, their 
existence largely forgotten by the country they 
fled. 

The men who jumped-across the border a 
decade ago can go "home" again anytime 
under President Carter's 1977 amnesty. But 
many won't , either because home is here now, 
for better or worse, or because they feel that 
the injustices they found in the America of the 
1960s are there still . 

"Canadians are a more peaceful people," 
said Thomas Hanes. " I really love this 
country." -

Said Harry Willcox, "I didn't think then that 
the United States was going to become any less 
militaristic and I don't think it has ." 

T hey are two of several thousand U.S. draft resisters and deserters believed still in Canada, vestiges of a time whose 
troubles are fadini fast from the American 
memory. The numbers have never been firm. 

Some 100,000 Americans refused military 
induction or deserted the armed forces durin, 
the Vietnam era, according to the U.S. 
government. Tens of thousands of these, 
perhaps most, ended up in Canada. 

John Landau of the Central Committee for 
Conscientious Objectors in Philadelphia 
estimates that one in three remain in Canada. 

Toronto was the focus of the exodus of 
American war protesters, a nd in the late 1960s 
and early 1970s many of them fraternized in a 
small expatriate community here. But they 
have long since gone their separate ways, 
teaching school, driving taxis, selling 
insurance. 

H anes , a red-haired, clean-shaven Chicago native, received and rejected his draft notice in 1969 while doing 
graduate work in East Asian studies at the 
University of Toronto. 

He has revisited Chicago several times in the 
past two years and finds America changed 
from tbose turbulent years. 

"Attitudes have changed ... people were less 
antagonistic toward each other," said Hanes, 
talking over wine in his book-lined apartment. 
"I had remembered a great deal of tension 
between individuals of different age groups, 
between the races , in the United States when I 
left, and I did not see it at all when I revisited. " 

U.S. foreign policy is markedly different 
from what it was 10 years ago, he said . 

"The U.S. is more willing to look at 
persuasion rather than force to solve its 
international problems . .. and it doesn 't 
necessarily always think of itself as morally 
correct anymore." 

But Hanes says he remains "suspicious" o( 
what the United States is capable of doing. He 
said this distrust is rooted in police repression 
he witnessed as an anti-war activist in Chicago 
in the late 1960s. 

The soft-spoken Willcox shakes hi head 
when asked whether he perceives the United 
States as a land transformed by the Vietnam 
War and other chastening experiences. 

"The regimentation and the censorship of 
the whole range of ideas is still going on," he 
said. " There is repression of ideas in the 
schools, for example. There is a lot less 
underground press, alternative press. " 

W hy the lowered voices of protest in the States? 
"Maybe there's some kind of re-

assessment going on. People are reassessing 
themselves as (ar as what would be an 
effective way to change things .. .. Perhaps 
people feel intimidated by the as-yet-unknown 
degree of government surveillance." 

Willcox, bearded, balding and denim-clad in 
the bippie style of the IteOs, drives a taxi for a 
living. He left bis native New York City for 
Toronto in 1970 when he realized his draft 
notice was due, and he has never returned, 
though he says he keeps in touch through 
reading and corresponding with (riends. 

H e had planned to move to Canada for - some time because he saw it as a "more liberal" country, Willcox said, sipping 
tea in a Toronto Chinatown cafe near his home. 
His opinion now: "I better understand that it 
has very much the same roots .... Canada 
seems dominated by the U.S." 

Are these men angry about the upheaval that 
brought them here? 

"I feel a certain hopeless anger about people 
who died in that war, both Vietnamese and 
American," said Hanes. "I feel resentful that I 
was forced to make the decision to come here. 
But one can say, 'Someone up there likes me .' 
because I've done well ." 

Willcox says he bears noanger. Does he now, 
so long after the war, feel forgotten? 

" When was I ever remembered?"

The tests found that samples of smoke taken last 
Dec. 15 from a burning 26-acre rice field have 
statistically significant " mutagenic" effects, said

Smith is accused of failing to report income of $6 .5

Third Requirements 
(Continul'd from page I) Armitage: 'Unfair' 

Shell Oil reported a 16 
percent increase to $224 million 
for the quarter . while Phillips 
Petroleum. which has limited 
foreign operations. reported a 4 
pel'cent increase in pI'ofits. Formal discussions con-

cerning aGE change at Third 
fi rst began last spring. A GE 
Review Committee, composed 
of both students and faculty, 
evaluated the present set of 
requi rements and submitted.its 
recommendations to the Third 
College Council. 

The committee 's major 
concern according to Watson, 
was co~plaints made by Third 
students and alumni con-
cerni ng the "alarmi ng " 
problems in students' writing 
abilities. 

Last November ilie Third 
College Council and faculty 

voted in support o( the 
requirement option proposed 
by the committee. The new 
requirement was then passed 
by the Council on Educational 
Policy , an advisory body to the 
senate. 

The new requirement will 
combine an emphasis upon 
both written and oral 
expression. but will place a 
higher priority upon writing 
skills, according to Watson. 

In other senate action, a 
motion was passed by voice 
vote yesterday to eliminate a 
required instructor's consent of 
the pass/fail grading option.

Armitage said that all

Nemesis Strikes Ag.ain 
Golfers Out-Putted 
By Dominguez Hills 

By Wayne Hunt 
It was all Dominguez Hills as 

they turned the tables once 
again on UCSD, dumping them 
43-11, last Friday afternoon at 
south Torrey Pines golf course. 

The Triton golfers have close 
to annihilated everybody in 
district competition-except 
for Dominguez Hills. 

Sal ' Johnson led the 
Dominguez devastation with 
a red hot round of 74. Triton 
coach Joe Owens remarked of 
Jobnson, "he has a funky 
1Wi1ll; It eu,ht to be put In a 
museum." 

But It was 'Owens who was 
fil'lt to admit It. "They beat us 
lOUDdly once a,aln." 
. Dominguez earlier In the 

season cleanly disposed of 
UCSD despite the Tritons' most 
Im.,re.alve outinc all year. It 
wu no different Friday as 
Bobby Sepulsa carded a 75 

along with other Dominguez 
scores of 75 and 77 to put the 
icing on the cake. 

It was Jim Miller with a 78 
and Harris Frankel close 
behind at 79 that tried to 
salvage a little respect for 
UCSD. 

The story was thesame, a few 
Tritons managed to break 80, 
but the supporting cast just 
could not crack the barrier. 
Performance as such m'ight be 
sufficient against a Pomona 
Pitzer or an Azusa Pacific, but 
it just will not cut the cake 
against a team the caliber of 
Dominguez HiUs. 

Triton coach Owens said, 
". was disappointed in the 
team's performance," but he 
added "it is clear Dominguez is 
tough competition. It's obvious 
we are going to have to deal 
with them."

Over The Line 

Not Just Any Sport 
8y Jon Goetz 

Senior Slaff Wrill'r 
[t's been described as "a 

softball game played on the Sa n 
Diego beaches by three per on 
teams that are invariably in 
some stage of undre sand 
inebriation. ,. 

Over The Line , spawned in 
San Diego 26 years ago, has 
attracted a culUike following of 
thousands of players and 
s pectators for just those 
reasons. It 's more than just 
another sport . 

" It 's basically just a crazy 
game. It offers a nythi ng you 
could want: beer drinking, 
competition, girl watching," 
said UCSD Recreation 
Athletics staffer Scott Berndes, 
whose 1978 team lost in the 
finals of the World Champion· 
ships on Fiesta Island. 

Basically, OTL is a baseball-
type game where players try to 

hit ba lis down a 60-foot wide 
court in places where the three 
opposing players a re not. The 
batter gets a hit when she or he 
bats the ball past the line. 55 
fe et [rom home pla te and the 
defensive players fail to catch 
it. A home run is a ball hit past 
the last fielder. There is no base 
running. The teams just keep 
track of who is on the base. 

This weekend college 
students get a chance to 
participate in the competition/ 
decadence. Lowenbrau beer, 
appropriately, is sponsoring 
the fourth annual San Diego 
Collegiate Over The Line 
Classic Satuniay at Mariner's 
Point on Mission Beach. 

Sign ups [or men 's , women's 
and coed divisions are due 
Thursday at the Recreation 
Office along with a $6 entry fee. 

Though the tournament 
directors can ' t promise 

thousands of naked, drunken 
fans like in the July World 
Championships on the Bay, 
they can ensure that the basic 
elements of the sport it elf will 
be there. 

" We basically want to expose 
students who don't live in the 
San Diego al'ea to the game. 
There are two elements of the 
game, the spectacle a nd the 
basic sport. We're trying to 
promote the sport itself, " said 
Mike Hipp, a nine year player 
who shares Berndes' office. He 
claims to have finished 412th in 
iast year's championships. 

This year 30 to SO teams are 
expected from UCLA, Santa 
Clara and the San Diego area 
colleges . 

The level of competition 
won't be as high as some 
tournaments ," assured 
Berndes . " Novice players

Over The Line Strategies Told Golfers Suffer 
Setback (Continued from page 7) won't be embarrassed." _ Newcomers to the sport have 

a lot more to learn about the 
&arne than the rules thou,h. 
First. they must know about 
who they're ,oing to be playing 
apinst. 

The next thing the novice 
must do is think of a name for 
his team, preferably an 
unbelievably Kross and 
raunchy one. Some of the 
milder (printable) collegiate 
winners winners in the past 
years were called "Too Big for 

Linda ," and "Shit, 1 Don·t 
Know. " They get worse . 

Next, the new player must 
think of a strategy to distract 
the opponents. For example, 
the Mexican Federales played 
in a San Felipe OTL tourna-

"There are three types of 
players that play OTL," said 
Bemdes. "First there is the 
player who's serious about the 
Kame. He Just wants to play 
and he'll practice hard for each 
tournament. Number two is the 
guy who's new to the game. He 
wants to learn. He'll try to play 

'Promise' Predictable 

well and he' ll also drink some 
beer. 

"Number three is the guy 
who's well on his way to being 
drunk at seven in the morning. 
He has no concern about how he 
plays. He generally makes an 
ass out of himself," said 
Berndes, who Is rumored to be a 
combination of number one and 
number three.

priately detestable as Marion 
Hillyard . However, she has the 
disconcerting appearance of 
being on the verge of tears. As a 
result, this all but destroys the 
strength of the hard bitten, 
" business first" matriarch 
which she plays. 

Michael O'Hare's role of 
Micl!ael's best friend and 
business partner Ben Avery 
could have used a bit more of 
fleshing out. Instead. he is 
reduced to a mere cardboard 
figure with a plastic smile and 
an occasional line oC well-

applies to Lawrence Luckin-
bill 's Dr. Peter Gregson, who . 
comes across the screen 
unintentionally as a passive, 
modern day Pygmalion 
mooning over Quinlain ' s 
Galatea. 

In the motion ,picture, " the 
promise" not only refers to the 
title of the love story, but to 
what awaits the viewers as 
well : predictability . The

around their shoulders. Their 
tactic failed to intimidate a 
girl's team. however. and they 
were smothered by the women: 

If the novice can't master 
these skills. he may decide to 
simply work on his game skills. 
Hipp advises ,trying to outthink 
the hitters a nd trying to cover 
areas of the court where they 
will likely hit the ball. "The 
skills of the game are simple." 
he said. " Refining those skills 
is the more difficult task." 

Racquetball 
(Conlinued from pagt' 7) 

" Right now we 're looking Cor 
more women to play on the 
team, " Anderson commented. 
" We especially need someone 
to go up to the All-Calor we 
won't be able to go." Anyone 
interested in racquetball or in 
loining the UCSD team is asked

Looking ahead to district

t:Ome up against Dominguez 
once again, Owens said. " it 
might have been a little setback 
(or us. they have beaten us 
soundly the last two times : we 
need to play some damn good 
golf. " 

USlU will offer other 
opposition said Owens. " No 
doubt about it, they recruit. 
They have won districts as long 
as I can remember." 

Owens did not rule out Point 
Lorna as a source of district 
competition also. He said. " If 
we play good golf. we will fini sh 
third. If we play really good 
golf. we might take it a ll. "
