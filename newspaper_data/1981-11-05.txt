As I stepped out into the rain, I cringed as If

over me - overwhelming pity. Rain for me 
meant an unpleasant, wet walk toclass. But for

How moral are methods 
for affirmative action? 

Editor: 
Rec ntly while filling out a 

form I was asked for my ethnic 
background. This brought to 
my mind the fundamental 
question of affirmative action 
laws as they are currently 
written . Few wi ll di agree 
with the goals of a ffirm ative 
action - which is to integrate 
all ethnic groups more fully 
into our society. But is the 
basic method moral? 

In the past generation, after 
th civil rights efforts of the 

ixties. we had managed to 
remove ethnicity from the 
American legal system. For 
the first time in th history of 
this country, one could read 
the law and find no reference 
to t heethnic background of the 
citizenry. Now in the pursuit 
of the laudable goal of the 
elimination of discrimination. 
we have returned to the old 
form of the law wherein it is 
now ethnically sensitive. Once 
again, not on ly are quotas 
legal. they are required by law. 
We have tagged our populace 
by ethnic background. Court 
cases have arisen in which the 
plaintiff accuses thedefendant 
of discrimination (which the 
defendant admit·) and then 
the courts find for discrimina· 

t ion in the name of fighting 
discrimi nation (t he Bakke 
case). 

If one starts from othe 
precept that a ll societal 
transactions should be 
ethnically blind. i.e. one's 
ethnic background ought to be 
irrelevant , then we can use as 
a bas is of morality that 
di 'crimination due to ethnic 
background i ' wrong. If in the 
pursuit of the ethnically blind 
society we relegalize ethnic 
sen 'itivity then how can we 
'ay that it i any more moral 
than the old policies~ If it is 
immoral to not hire someone 
on the basis of his ethnic 
background, then why is it 
moral to hire him on the basis 
of his ethnicity. It won't 
nec ssarily change the 
attitudes that led to his not 
being hired in the first place. 

Perhaps a better policy for 
u: to follow rather than 
relegalizing et hnic ensitivity 
is to examine how these 
problems have been solved 
historically. It is always easier 
to get someone to do somet hing 
they have a self interest in 
doing rat her than somet hing 
they dislike. Rather than 
forcing the hirings of people 011 
the basis of ethnic back· 

ground, can we instead. say. 
generate an economic boom 
such as to employ everyone? 
Traditionally various ethnic 
groups have been absorbed 
into society as th y have been 
coopted into the labor force 
where over time the 
discrimination vani hes . 
Ronald Reagan and Edward 
Kennedy are both of Iri 'h 
extract ion, but how many 
people vote against t hem due 
to that? A century ago, they 
might well have been 
u nelectable. 

I am an individual and wish 
to be treated as such. Under 
affirmative action. it is legal to 
treat me as a member of a 
group and judge me by my 
ethnic background . Thus 
whenever [ deal with a firm 
with federal contracts or a 
government agency . I can 
legally be treated by my eth nic 
background . One of the 
fundamental precepts of the 
founding of this country was 
the worth of the individual. It 
has been applied with varying 
universality ever si nce. but 1t1 
general as time has passed. it 
has been applied to more and 
more people. It is a shame to 
see it in retreat.

'The evil weed' 
continued from page 2 

Though reversals like these 
are th nature of scientific 
inquiry. they 've been largely 
ignored by our friends. Most 
know the medIcal jury is s t ill 
out on marijuana and don 't 
expect it to come back soon 
with a verdict. 

For many of our friends, the 
apparent absence of balanced 
drug information is a real 
tragedy , Que tions of 
legalization and dangers 
relative to alcohol cloud the 
i sue of marijuana safety . 

Perhaps the fairest analyis 
was pu blished last year In the 
Harvard Medical chool 
Health Letter. which reported 
the following: 

*"While high, manjuana 
users may become somewhat 
clumsy; they react more 
slow ly than normal, perceive 
t he passage of t I me less 
accurately, pay at tention less 
well. and do arit hmellc les 
well; they al 'o 'how defects in 
short-term memory during the 
high . A serious threat to 
health from this condition is 
impaired driving .... " 

*"There is no ~olId 
evidence that other. more 
seriou or lasting psychologi -
cal effects are hkely to result 
from marijuana use ...... And 
there are no reports to show 
"that marijuana permanently 
damages the brain." 

*"Sufflciently h avy. 
long-term marijuana smoking 
probably lead s to chronic 
bronchitis, just as tobacco 
smoking does. II 

*"During the high. 
marijuana causes the heart to 
beat fa ter and work harder. 
Although this effect is 
in ignificant in healthy 
people. il may be a hazard for 
anyone with heart disease." 

*"Production of the male 
hormone testoslerone and of 
sperm can be reduced by 
marijuana. although the 
effects appear to be temporary 
and reversible; the signifi-
cance of these change· is 
unclear. Effects on females are 
e,en less well studIed. but It 
appears that marijuana i. 
capable of disturbing the 
menstrual cyc le ... Whether 
marijuana can cause genetic 
damage" is SImply not 
known .. 

Whether you _moke or rail 
against marIjuana . the 
current medical eVIdence i 
neit her so benign nor sodeadly 
that it deserves explOItation. 

Humphrey IS kidding 
himself If he thinks he has a 
public health menace by the 
horns. He seems scared to face 
the real dragon : The large 
maJorit} of marijuana u<;ers 
are over 18 and would find his 
performance good mo\ Ie 
material.

The unheard 
constituency 
Editor: 

I am writingthi ' in response 
to the recent front page article 
concerning the student and 
the AS (Guardian. Nov. 2). [ 
am not an activist at all , but 
after the confusing boycotts 
and the editorial by Tollner, I 
decided I should find out. 50.1 
went to Tollner's meeting; 
what [sawwa a group of very 
angry students. At Tollner's 
suggestion , I also attended the 
AS meeting the following 
night; what I 'aw again wa . a 
group of very angry s tudents. 

These vocal students hardly 
represent the majority of 
UCSO's undergraduates. 
After all, the average student 
is the unheard s tudent, too 
busy with his or her PhYSICS 
and 0, Chem. to be involved in 
school politics. However, the 
fru tration these acti vis t · 
displayed was very real for 
almost all the student bod y. 

It seems to me t he anger 
arises becau e of conflicting 
interests, AS council members 
are s incere in their claims that 
they want to aid the students.

it is simply that they don't 
know what the students wanl. 
Their support of the boycott s 
and their funding for CWO 
was for t he benefit of the 
s tudent s. As the council 
members stated , it was their 
hope to "raise the studenrs ' 
level of consciousness" about 
broader political iss ues 
through the various boycotts 
and the film series by CWD, 

Nevertheless, what the AS 
doesn't seem to realize IS that 
thes e are no t t he fir s t 
priorit ies of the undergrads. 
This is a primarily 'cience 
oriented Uni vers it y. Th e 
students work hard on their 
studies and in their free time 
they want to play hard, Good 
or bad , most s tudents would 
rather attend a TGIF than a 
political film in their 'parse 
free hours. 

If AS counci l members 
reall y want to represent their 
constituency, they s hould 
at tempt to hear that unheard 
student. They might be very 
surpri ed by the encounter.

Editor: 

[ am writing in response to 
David Tollner's let ter and 
meeting. [ don 't know where 
he gets hi s inform at ion, but [ 
and th e majorit y of my friends 
feel that the A is fairl y 
represent at ive of our needs 
and opinions. 

There is no rule t hat says 
that ·tudent bodies should not 
be political. Traditionally, all 
over the world, students have 
taken various s tands which 
have led to significant social 
changes. We are at an age 
when we still can voice our 
opinions without the fear of 
reprisal s from our bo ' 'es , 
community, and fellow human 
bein?s. As we get older we 
won t have thi s privilege. We 
also owe it to ourselves and 
society to be politically active. 
ft is us and them t hat most 
polit ical actions will affect. 
Therefore, I don' t think our AS 
as the lar ge · t s tud e n t 
organization, should remain 
apolitical. 

Da v id T o llner m ight 
disagree with the political 
choice,S made by the AS, but he 

~ hou ldn ' t qu estion the ir right 
to maket hem. Yeti don't think 
that t he boycotts a re bad 
choices eit her. Coors is a 
corporat ion r hat ha ' had 
di scriminatory rul es, and 
Qu es tionable hiring practices 
for yea rs. Out of respect for 
fe llow human being ' we 
s houldn 't s upport s uch a 
corporation. We also have the 
more immediate stake that as 
soon·to·be workers, we would 
like fair treatment at our jobs. 
We have few tools in our power 
to a ffect corporate decision 
making. Boycotting is one of 
the few. 

The Nestle boycott a lso has 
to do wit h is:-iues t hat concern 
us all. Their in fa nt formu la 
promot ion in less developed 
co untri e s h as ca u se d 
cons iderab le har m. Th eir

Never mind w hat Nest Ie says, 
one need only visit a less 
developed country to see the 
h a rmful effec t ' o f t he 
promot ion. Shouldn 't we all be 
co n ce rn ed a bout fu t u re 
generati ons , wheth er from 
thi s country or not ~ 

As fa r as t he Chancel lor\;

have a say in mat t-ers which 
directl v and ob\'iously concern 
us? Iso't this country run on 
th premises of a represent a,

[ happen to think that the

The cause of th e protest has

Education is California's best investment of tax dollars, and 
the University of California is one of the state's most precious assets. 

Federal cutbacks for Education could deny thousands of 
Californ ians access to a Universi ty education. Further cuts to 
UC 's sta te funded budget will ieopardize the University 's ability 
to maintain i ts 113-year commitment to excellence. 

You could avoid 5% cuts in state operations, like UC, by 
spreading necessary reductions over the entire budget. 

As a voter, I urge you, as Governor and as a UC Regent and 
Alumnus, to continue investing our tax dollars wisely. You must 
protect quality oublic h igher education by reconsideflng your 
decision to decraase the state's commitment te the Un/versify 
of California. 

Please preserve quality

Body Shoppe offers help for skin 
BY DONNA HUNT 

Ilave the acne blues got you 
down? Are you tired of 
Wolfman Jack telling you what 
to do about those dreaded 
"zits?" If so. t urn off the radio 
and get over to t he Student 
Health Center's new Self·Help 
Derm Clinic. 

The new clinic has been in 
operation since las t Monday. 
thanks to a grant from the 
Chancellor, proposed by Susan 
Daniels (hea lth edu cation 
speciali st) and a group of 
st udents at UC D. 

The cl ini 's Acne Program is 
a self·help center where a

------------------------------

s tudent can learn about skin 
problems at his convenience. 
Inform atio n is avai lable on 
normal skin, different form s of 
acne, and on what can be done 
to alleviate individual cases of 
acne. 

A well-trained peer health 
advocate is always on duty to 
help the student go through 
the program, and if necessary. 
the clinic will refer the 
individual to outside medical 
care. 

Free samp les of acne 
treatment · are available to 
s tudents as part of the 
program. This can be a money· 
saver. No longer do they have 
to spend time and money at 
pharmacies trying different 
products in hope ' that they 
wi ll do the trick. Students can 
now test a product before 
buying a large amount. 

The program also ha ' 
information on over·the· 
counter drugs. Many products 
on the market today contain 
very little or no effeclive anti· 
acne ingredients, and the 
Health Center has compiled a 
list of these products. 

The program also attempts 
to separate fact from fallacy. 
Acne does not arise from 
dirtiness or neglect. they say. 
but rather from physiological 
disorders. Oth r mVthical 
causes IIlclude such thIngs as 
unusual sexual ~havi()r. too 
much chocolate. and dirt in the 
pon'~ 

What IS acnt'? II IS a skin 
condition characterIzed bv 
pImples. commonl:. calk'i 
"zits," that appear on a 

person's face. back or 
shoulders. But acne is more 
than just the stray pimple or 
twO that nearly everyone (85· 
% percent) encounters during 
adolescence. 

Two factors that may 
aggravate acne are common 
here on campus: stress and 
tension. Acne is primarily due 
to overactivity of oil glands In 
the skin. although underlying 
causes are noL yet kmm n. 

~ost treatments aim to 
prevent f urt her acne or to 
minimize the eXIstIng 
condition. Inform at Ion on 
home trea tment s for prevent· 
ing and minimizing acne are

"I think the Self·Care Clinic 

is an excellent idea," ~aid the 
Health Center"!:. Dr. Robert 
Daigneault. "It helps the 
· tudents get a better 
understanding of what is 
happening to them." 

Inside the nev... Body Shoppe 
there is also a blood pressure 
center. a health resource 
library where books may be 
checked out. and free 

pamphlet~ on a \ ariety of 
health topics. Soon. there will 
be information on wart:,

Caffeine's effects DOG_BSBUay 
continued from page 7 
birth defects in mothers that 
have an exces intake of 
caffeine during pregnancy. 
Caffeine may al so be a 
contr ibuting fa ct or in 
fibrocystic brea t disease, a 
benign condition. 

The fact that caffeine is an 
addictive drug is a little known 
fact. There is a point at which 
the intake of caffeine 
surpasses an individual 's 
thre hold to tolerate the drug. 
This condition is called 
caffeinism. The threshold at 
which caffeini m begin s 
varies from per on to person 
but has a poss ible range of 200 
mg. to 750 mg. of caffeine 
daily. 

Caffe ini s m itself i an 
illness and should be treated 
as s uch . Sy mpt oms of 
caffein i m are extreme 
nervo usness, irritability , 
tremu lousnes ' , chronic 
muscle tension, insomnia, 
rapid and alarmingly strong 
heart beats and upset 
'tomach. Early detection of 

caffeinism can prevent fur ther 
health compl ications and the 
treatment for thi ' i ' u ually 
only a regulated consumption 
of caffeine , depending on 
individual cases. If a person 
with caffeini m suddenl y 
decrease ' his caffeine intake, 
he may experience withdrawal 
symptoms. These ymptoms 
include 'evere headaches. 
tiredness and irritability to 
name just a few . 

Caffeine should not just be 
treated as a harmless drug. It 
does have severe side-effects 
that can be harmful to the 
human body as can be een 
clearl y. By examining one's 
own caffeine intake with the 
fo llowi ng Ii t of caffe ine 
content. one can see if the 
amount of caffeine in one's 
da ily diet is too high. As one ex· 
heavy caffeine u 'er put it: '"

Things just aren't like they used to be 

By THOMAS URBACH 
Sd c n L'C Ed i t or 

A re~earcher has claimed Ihal fire cau<.,es pam 
because ib particles arc sharp.

Thif. theory \\ as published around :350 B.C. whIch 
makef. It 2:~:~1 vcars old or very old news indeed . The 
researcher. fa-miliar to some. IS Plato. the Greek 
philosopher. This t henry is spelled out in The 
TilJlaells. 

Plato adopted a view of na t ure which had 
developed from the thinking of Empodocles. 
Heraclitus, and Democritus. According to the 
t h 'ory. matter, the stuff of the world , was composed 
of tiny indivisible part ides which they ca lled atoms. 
Thus began our modern atomic th ory, though the 
Greek's conception of the atom is not hing like ours. 
Plato expounds thi ' atomic theory along WIth the 
notion that there are four basic element:-, in the 
world: earth. water. air and fire . 

The Greeks thought that water lurned to air 
(evaJXJratecl) when heated . This led Plato to the 
conclus ion that the elements were really just 
differ nt forms of the same thing. Plato's theory had 
to find ~ome common fact or in the elements that 
made them basically [he "'ame, but all owed them to 
(hang ' form . This C(mlnlOn factm would be the atom 
that compo-.ed t h part icle ... of the four clemen t" .

Global 
Security 

The Academic Council 
recently appointed a Special 
Committee on Global ecurity 
and Cooperation to consider 
the establishment of a center 
to explore new and existing 
ways to control the develop-
ment, use. and proliferation of 
nuclear weapon ' , a' well as 
the ways in which the 
pres 'ure of Third World 
development impinge on 
potential international 
conflict. 

The Committee ha' begun 
it deliberations and invites 
re pon 'e from all interested 
members of the univer 'itv 
community. [t al '0 solicit-, 
information about ongoing 
research activities that 
address the 'e i sues. Fifteen 
copies o f statements of 
interest and ongoing research 
s hould be submitted to: 

pecial Committee, Box G, 
Office of the Vice Pre 'ident , 
Univer 'ity Hall , Berkeley, CA 
94720. These statements must 
be received no later than Dec. 
t5 if they are to be considered 
by the committee in 
formulating it s recommenda-
tions, Proposals that have 
already been received by the 
Committee may be reviewed in 
the Academic Senate Office on 
each campu·. 

Bomb 
threat 

A bomb threat forced the 
cancellation of a Math 2A 
midterm la t night. This was 
the latest incident in the 
recent ras h of bomb threat s. 

Two cam pus police officers 
interrupted a phy 'ics re\' iew 
'e' 'ion in USB 2722 at about 

4:45 p.m. and annou nced that 
a bomb threat had been made. 
The building was promptly 
cleared. 

Barbara Robinson, one of 
the displaced ~t udent;;, 
desnibed the offenders as 
"immature." Referring to a 
biology midterm which was 
called off on Tuesday becau-,e 
of a ix)mb threat, ~., he ~ald, 
"Someone do(.'"n't learn their 
meiosis, -,0 they call in a bomb 
I hreat." -

In addition to iJelng 
immature and inconSiderate, 
those who call in bomb threats 
are crirmnab. Bomb threah 
are fe lonies and punishable by 
fine or impri'-oonment.

Los AlaDlos develops eye diagnosis 
Los Alamos scient i<;ts have 

develop d a new technique 
t hat makes it possible, for the 
fir ' t time, to measure 
precisely the fragile ou ter 
layer uf the human eye. 
Doctors can now determine 
the 'hape of thi s layer - the 
cornea - to better aid those 
with near- or far -<; ight edness, 
astigmatism , or di sease. 

J. James Rowsey, chi f of 
corneal 'urgery at the Dean A. 
McGee Eye In ' titute and the 
Department of Ophthalmology 
at t he U ni versity of 
Oklahoma, 'ays the Los 
Alamo technique i ' 'ome-
thing eye 'pecialish have been 
seeking without 'uccess for 
the past 100 years. The 
technique will be used by 
Rowsey in evaluating the new 
met hod of surgica lly reshap-
ing ditorted human cornea ' 
that is ca lled radial 
keratotom y. 

The cornea is the shiny , 
thin, "tunic" that covers the 
eye ball in front of the iris. A 
window, the cornea provides 
as much as 75 percent of the 
eye' optical power. A " hort" 
eye, or a di 'lorted cornea that 
i flattened, produce ' far-
ightednes '; a "long" eye, or a 

bulging cornea causes near-
sightedness; ast igmati 'm is 
the result of an egg-shaped 
cornea; and a cone-shaped 

.. 

wmea is the resu It of a 
progre"sive, blinding disease 
ca lled keratoconous . An y 
distortion of this fragile eye 
cO\'er means light is not 
focused properly upon the 
retina, a membrane lining th 
back of t he eye \~ hich 
t ransm its visual signals to the 
brain by way of t he opt ic 
nerve. The resu It is f LIZZY 
vision of varying degrees ancl, 
in t he case of keratoconous, 
ultimate loss of ~ight. 

The primary commercia l 
instrument for measuring the 
cornea has been in use for 
many y ar~, but is limited to 
mea urement s of the central 
three millimeters. The cornea 
has a surface profile of about 
12 millimeters. Newer, 
photographic instrument· 
provide excellent picture of 
the cornea up to 9 millimeters, 
but it is extremely difficult to 
interpret the photographic 
data so that those correct ing 
distort ion by len 'es or by 
, urgery can properly evaluate 
the amount of correction 
needed in the eye. It is al 0 
hard for surgeons to tell if 
healthy cornea ' the y 
transplant into keratoconous 
victims are properly spherical 
after surgery, or if they are in 
turn distorted by poss ible 
va riation ' in the tension of 
mu ltiple tinytitches holding 

.,- .... 

the nel\' organ in place. 
Dann y Duss. an engi neer 

with the Los Alamos Medium 
Energy Physics Di\'ision, who 
has don e pioneering work in 
de\'eloping inst ruments to 
correct distortffi cornea ' by 
".s hrinking " them with 
precisely controllffi localized 
heat , was work ing on I he 
prublem of cornea l data

break with a Los Alamos 
phys icist, Dick Hutson, Doss 
dI scussed the matter. Minutes 
later, Hut son returned with a 
mat hemat ical a lgorithm on 
which Doss could base a 
computer program to interpret 
corn al photographic informa-
tion . 

"rt was a 'eureka ' 'ituation, 
that happens once in a while in 
science," Doss says. 

Hu tso n de scribes the 
cor n ea l photographs as 
'howing concentric ring ' of 
reflected light. 

" In a healthy , spherical 
cornea, t he pictures show nine

problem exists, the photo ' 
show ring ' t hat are pulled out 
of shape. We cou ld see the 
problem. but we cou ldn 't 
measure how much correction 
the 'urgeon or opt ical expert 
needed to compensate for, in 
order to restore proper vision,"

Ether incident causes 
director to resign 

BY DANIEL LANNEVILLE 
Richard Bou langer, the 

director of the Atomicafe 
concert series, announced hi s 
re ' ignation today after 
receiving nearly univer 'al 
co nd emnation for hi s 
programming practices. The 
latest concert in the series was 
held las t Tuesday evening and 
featured , among ot her works, 
a compo ' ition called The 
Effects of Elher 01/ Ihe Human 
Body during which the 
compo 'er, Jame ' Soe Nyun, 
repeatedly inhaled from a jar 
containing a colorle liquid , 
alleged to be ether, whi le 
playing an excerpt from 
Maurice Rave l ' piano 
concerto for the left hand 
a lone. 

During the performance, 
fumes filled the poorly 
ventilated hall. causing 

distress in the audience. Some 
people simply got up and left, 
while some who st ayed 
complained of nau 'ea and 
headache. Although the stage 
crew opened doors in an 
at tempt to air out t he hall , the 
fumes persisted virtually 
throughout the rest of the 
concert 

Boulanger reports that he 
had no idea what oe Nyun 
had planned and feels he was 
deceived. "We run rehearsal ' 
on the day of the concert and 
Jim (Soe Nyun ) told me that 
the piece 'wasn't finished yet' 
and so all I aw wa him 
playing the piano for a minute 
and s howing his s lide which, 
by the way, did not have a 
diagram of the ether molecule 
drawn on it. not then 
anyway."

'Performers Forutn' offers 
a musical vehicle to UCSD 

BY ID CORBETT 
StnH Writer 

UCSD has long been 
acknowledged a a leading 
center for the creative musical 
arts , and it vehicle, 
Atomicafe, among the leading 
forums for the presentation of 
American new music . 
However, students of the 
interpretive musical arts at 
UCSD gave notice last week 
that they too are deserving of 
recognition and applause for 
their talents, by inaugurating 
their own "Performers 
Forum. " 

This series, produced by, 
and explicitly for students of 
mu ic performance here, will 
convene s ix time throughout 
this year. Thur s day 's 
performance, happil y, was a 
resounding success. 

Perhap the mo t ch ivalrous 
of the performances wa the 
evening firs t. With memories 
of the Chick Corea, Miroslav 
Vitous performance of two 
nights earlier s till lingering in 
the mind of many in the 
somewhat spar e audience, 
ba si ·t (and concert coordina-
tor) Dave uggs and pianist 
Randy Begault gave a very 
inspired, if perhaps over 
anxious rendition of Miles 
Davis' "Nefertiti. " The duet 
gave early notice that audience 
preconception was to be left 
out of these performances, in 
much that same way that 
Atomicafe has traditionally 
managed to elude stereotype, 
or routine during its long and 
distinguished existence. 

Following the jazz were a 
lovely recital of ].S. Bach 's 
Serabande in B minor. by 
sophomore guitarist/compo-
ser Steve Blumberg, two 
rigorous soprano arias by G.F. 
Handel, intelligently and 
articulately performed by 
graduate student of vocal 
performance Chere Campbell, 
a somewhat uninspired, but 
nonethele ss enjoyable 
Divetimento for clarinets, and 
bassoon compo ed by W.A. 
Mozart, and a most memorable 

and truly charismatic 
performance of a traditional 
Mexican folksong, "Solamente 
una vez" by Andrea Hains, a 
fir ·t year soprano graduate 
tudent, on the first half. 
After intermission, two 

bouree's from Bach's English 
Suite were selected for 
performance by pianist 
Ka th leen Kranz. Although 
very competently performed, 
one could not help noticing the 
co nspicuously overbearing 
tim bre of a piano, an 
instrument invented one 
hundred years after the death 
of the composer, Also included 
on the second half were Lynn 
Becker's very brave, and very 
worthwhile performance of 
Edgard Varese's vituoso flute 
solo, Density 21.5. baritone 

vocalist Peter Ward" version 
of John Cage's indeterminate 
010 compo ition , Aria , a very 

inspiring performance of Paul 
Hindemith' s SOtlala for 
con traba ss with piano , 
featuring bass ist Mark 
Dresser, and the no Ie 
virtuostic John McKay on 
accompaniment. 

The evening concluded with 
the only student composition 
of the performance, vocalist 
Andrea Hains "Skeleton," a 
music·theatre piece fea turing 
several players in costume, 
who build an improvi ation 
around a relatively, simple, 
but catchy tune sung by 
'oprano Andrea Hain . The 
piece proved quite effective, in 
part due to the visual effects of

members Robert Erickson and 
Will Ogdon. Nee's explanation 
i that publicity and media 
coverage of symphony 
concerts has been close to nil 
here on campus. 

For whatever the reason , 
Nee hopes that this upcoming 
season of concerts will end the 
obscurity and bring deserved 
recognition to the orchestra 
and chorus. 

The all-Beethoven concert 
also includes shorter rarely-
performed works of the 
composer for smaIl orchestral 
groups. Featured vocal soloists 
for the final movement of the 
Ninth Symphony are Ann 
Chase, Kathleen O'Brien. 
Thoma Oberjat, and Philip

Pippi Longstocking at her best 
BY MIKEL TOOMBS 

luff Wriler 
I have a friend who once had 

to choose between sp nding a 
weekend in San Francisco and 
s taying home to watch a Pippi 
Longstocking film fe tival on 
televi ·ion . He didn 't make the 
tr ip, 

As a rule , movie ' centered 
on children tend to be tame, 
dull, anti eptic affairs, This is 
attributable chiefly to the fact 
that most such film s are made 
by adults for other adults: they 
represent what filmmakers 
think parents think children 
want to (or s hould) see. Every 
once in a great while, for 
whatever the rea 'on ', there 
are s ignificant exceptions, 
showing children actually 
having jun , disobeying or 
ignoring their parents, and 
living the anarchic exi tence 
to which only they areentitled. 

The Pippi Longstocking 
feature ', made in Sweden and 
crudely dubbed into English 
(and all the more delightfu l for 
it), are just such exceptions. 
One of the films in the eries, 
Pippi Goes On Board (1971), 
can be viewed thi aturdayat 
6 p.m. on Channel 5. 

Pippi Long'to king, played 
by Tnger Nil son, i a punky 
pr -teen with pigtails that 

stick straight out, looking 
rather like Olga Korbut or 
perhaps a budding Lene 
Lovich . Her more obviou ' 
attributes include great 
strength - when someone 
does something she doesn't 
care for, s he throws him up 
into a tree - lot s of money, a 
wild imagination and, most 
important , a lack of visible 
parental su pervision . 

In Pippi LOllgsfocking, the 
first of the series, ollr heroine 

television 
arrives mysterious ly alone in a 
small town to claim her 
family 's house. Once there s he 
befriends a pair of you nger 
children , with whom s he 
embark on all manner of 
mischief, and later s he entice 
the remainder of the village 
kids, Pied Piper· tyle, into the 
pursuit of "forbidden" 
pleasures. Need le 's to say, this 
behavior doesn't endear her to 
the village parents, who seem 
willing to have somebody take 
their offspring off their hands, 
but not the impertinent. 
uncontrollabl Pippi . 

Pippi furth r outrages th 
adult with h rver tall talt' ·, 

uch a ' the tory that her 
fat her had been captured by 
pirate in the outh eas, 
"Yeah , right," they think 
cy nically, so imagine their 
suprprise when he turns up 
nea r the end of the film and ... 

Strong parallel to Pippi 
LOllgsfockillf( can be fou nd in 
Ma r y Pickford" Daddy 
LOlIglegs - a 1919 ilent in 
which a pigtailed Pickford 
organizes an orphanage revolt, 
gets drunk and generally has a 
fine time - and, more 
recently, Walt Disney's Mary 
Puppins. (It's interesting to 
remember that Oi ney was 
once noted for an oftcn cruelly 
anarchistic streak , notabl y in 
the early Mickey Mou se 
cartoon and la ter with 
Oonald Duck). 

To be s ure, Pippi is 
somew hat mindful of her 
depart ed mother. who 
watches over Pippi through a 
hoi in the c1ouds(a bizarre and 
ins pired touch), but her 
presence seems largely 
intangibl . 

Pippi Goes 011 Board (which 
I have not n) probably 
uffer the arne dilution that 

i all -too-typicalof equ I . but 
if it has but one,t nth th 
charm of t he original it 'hould 
be eniovable ~ atching.

Swimmers look for strong season 1M polo

Freshmen strengthen last year's 6-0 squad Foul Play 
BY BILL FISH 

Walk into the natatorium during a swim team workout. and 
the firs t thing that catches your eye is a chalkboa rd. Though 
partly wet. its readable . The board i . fill ed with explicit workou t 
procedures for the day. 

Coa h Bill Morgan is getting hi s team!' ready. As the upcoming 
season draws near, the coach has hi !> swimmers doing two hou rs 
of sprints and then weightlift ing, a rout ine performed every day. 
When the fin als come up, the coach as ures that his swimmers 
wi ll be sprinting three and a half hours a day. 

Morgan, who is in hi . fift h year with the men's team and onl y 

"The leam has a lot 
tougher schedule lhis 
year. We gel better, so 
we wanl bigger 
challenges. " 

- Bill Morgan 

hi s second wit h t he women's is trying to coordinate his pI' act ice~ 
so that most of his swimmers \vork out together. "The real 
diff renc between the two teams, " he explains, "is the skill 
leveL" Last year, his first with the women, that wa" "especially 
true." This year, ho\\'ever, the coach claims that the gap 
bet ween t he male and female ski llle\ el is closing, meaning that 
more women can keep up with th men. 

The men'~ team has "a lot tougher sch du le than las t year's," 
..,ays Morgan. "We get better every year, so we want higger 
challenges. " 

Both t ams are in Division III . although their schedu les 

consist of meets against some Division II opponents. The me('t 
with 'an Diego, tate, a Di vision I squad. is considered the real 

te~t for C ' J) this season. 
Though Morgan strives for annual impro\'ement he realIzes 

that his men's t am'" 6·0 dual meet record of last season Is hard 
to beat. The men also finished eighth in their di\·i..,ion. (Jut of 
about :300 schools. 

I d by returners 10hn Beckley, a two·year AII·American 
senior, Tracy trahl, an AII·Am rican backstroklllg Junior, and 
four All·American sophomores, the men's t'lquad is \\ hat the 
coach calls "well balanced ."

finalist in th 200 free, Pete, choff, another freest \ ler, and \Ian

Adding to th ir roster are freshman Barbara Lee , a fre · ... t vier, 
Diana Charles, a backstroke and fr est vier, and Lee .\lorrm\ 
Morro\\'" preliminary times in the lOO -and 200 f1~ are fa",ter 
than the standing Oi\ i..,ion III records. 

" I don't think \lur women have realized their IXllential )el." 
says 1m·gan. The coach anticipat·s to finish the \\'oll1en '", 
season "possibly in fift h or ",ixt h place," markedly impron'd ()\ l'r 
last season. lie abo belieYes that as man v a., ten to fourtc(:n

But that's just t he way Coach Bill Morgan likes them. 

Most Valuable Players of the Week 
Vickie Pride - Women's Volleyball 

In the Occidental tournament that UC D took top honor!' in 
over the weekend, Vicki played the entire tourney without 
making a single passing error. Last year Vicki played her best 
towards the end of the season and it appears that she wi ll repeat 
this cycle once again . Although she was not selected to the all · 
tournament team as were teammates Louise chwartz and 
Tam my Smit, Vicki wa' clearly a great asset to the Triton 
alta k. he hassteadilybeenagreatd(>coy for thet am'soutside 

hitters. Coach Doug Dannevik added that Vtcki is currenth the 
stronge ·t performer on the Triton's top ranked team. 

Andy Leask - Men's Fencing 
Andy was 3·0 in the first meet of the eason thl~ year. "It h a +7 

indicator rating. Andy' form was excellent thl's earl\' 111 the 
sea 'on and he played a very offen 'ive game with :-onll' fancy 
footwork . He is the captain of this year's men's foil team and I . 
clearly one of the team leaders. He is returning thi:. year from a 
five·y ar ab ence in the ·port. Andy's coach com ments, "He I~ an 
athlete and a sport man in the nth degree."

The UCS D women's 
volley ball team continues to 
pil e up victories at an 
incredibl e clip. The spikers are 
now a lofty 24·5 overall. 
including a perfect 13·0 in 
league play. 

Last weekend the Tritons 
swept aside a ll competitors at 
the Occidental Tournament en 
rou te to the cha mpionship. 
The final match for all the 
marbles went to UCSD, over 
La Verne, 12·15. 13· 15, 15·3. 
15· 11 and 15· 10, 

" We showed a lot of 
character ," beamed UC 0 
coach Doug Dannevik. "We've 
never been down that far and 
come back." 

Lou ise (Lu lu) chwartz and 
Tamm y Smit were named to 
the AIl ·Tournament Team, 

with Smit al~o wtnntng the 
much,co\'ctcd MVP. A stell ar 
pcrformance by the often 
o\'crlooked Vick te Pride also 
highlighted the competition. 

"Crowd support has helped 
us immensely in the pa~t." 

~ai d Dannevik. "and crowd 
~u pport is what we rea lly need 
now. These next few teams 
will be very tough .. 

The Occidental Tourna·

now four of the Tritons' next 
six opponent s are tough

Blake Storie put his time in 
playing net for Fou l Play 
scoring 3 goals and making 
numerous as~ists as well. 

Although female player" are 
n(l[ alltJ\\ ed b. tntramural 
ru les to play grialie. those on 
Foul Play are .. trong defensive 
players and definitely do thetr 
~ hare to keep their opponent ... 
from scoring. 

Toby Delong of Foul PIa did 
much of her maneuvering 
forward instead of the usual 
backward mann er. Delong, 

along wi t h BIos and 
Martinez, played in a club 
program tn San Fransisco 3 
year ' ago. Their experience 
gi\'es I he team an added 
advantage, and their abilit~

Championship. for the last :3 
years. (Delong and Blm,s ha\ e

A study of Dostoevsky's major works, from his first novel. 
Poor folk to his last. The Brothers Karamazov. Dostoevsky 
was obsessed with con tern porary politics, wh ich he viewed 
in religious terms. His vision of the era in which he lived 
was of a vast struggle between the forces of atheism in 
politics and the forces of Eastern Orthodox Christianity, 
His works will be studied in light of the historical, 
political. and theological issues which were of importance 
to him. For this reason, the reading list includes a small 
selection of writings by nineteenth century Russian 
political theorists, At the same time the course will 
examine the works of Dostoevsky as literary works of art, 
in order to discover the qualities of the author's genius 
which enabled him to work his ideological conceptions 
into literary form , 
Reading list : 
Selected writings of Belinsky, Cheryshevsky, and 
Dobroliubov,

Instructor: Margaret Ziolkowski 

In the early I 960's, Soviet literature underwent a renaissance, and formerly forbidden topics became the themes of 
controversial new works of fiction. With the renewed repression of the 1970's, many writers were driven into the ranks 
orthe diss idenlsand eventually became e~i1es. This course will deal primarily with novels and short stories published 
in the Soviet Union and abroad that re fl ect the fresh perspectives characteristic of the best Soviet writers of the past 
two d cades. Many of these works are remarkable for their frankness, Among the topics that will be discussed in c lass 
are the efforts of the so-ca lled " village writers" to present an unvarnished view of life in the countryside, the social 
malaises that b set Soviet intellectuals, and the stu lti fying and sometimes comical effects of the bureaucracy on 
day-to~ay existence. Some of the readings will include stories and novels by Vladlmar Voinovich, Yurl Trifonov, 
Viktor Nebrasov, Valentin Rasputin, and Vasili Shukshin.
