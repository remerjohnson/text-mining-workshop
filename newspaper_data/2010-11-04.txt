WEIGHING THE 
RESULTS

By Regina Ip
Associate News Editor

Students won’t need to worry about rush-
ing to lecture halls if they can tune in with the 
click of a button in the UC system’s new online 
pilot program.

On Nov. 2, the UC system announced 
its search for interested faculty members to 
take part in a two-year experiment to deter-
mine if online instruction can be offered at a 
UC-quality level.

“This study of undergraduate online 
instruction comes at a time when the uni-
versity, hemmed in by budget reductions, is 
faced with rising enrollment pressures and 
limited capital funds for facility expansion,” a 
University of California Office of the President 
statement said.

The examination is part of the Online 
Learning Pilot Project — a project exploring 
whether online classes can deliver high-level 
instruction — introduced in July by the UC 

Republicans painted Washington red 
on Tuesday, taking control of the House of 
Representatives with the largest majority since 
1947. GOP representatives for Congress won at 
least      60 extra House seats nationwide, includ-
ing two from California. They also gained six 
seats in the Senate. 

On-campus poll workers said voting went 
smoothly for most of the morning. However, 
during the afternoon rush, the Price Center 
polling location ran out of ballots. They were in 
short supply due to the many off-campus voters 
who showed up at the polling places. 

These voters were forced to cast provisional 
ballots because they were voting outside their 
precinct. Provisional ballots must be confirmed 
to prevent voter fraud, so many of the votes cast 
at UCSD have not been included in the official 

tally, Vice President of External Affairs Michael 
Lam said. Poll workers estimated that up to 50 
percent of UCSD votes were provisional.

One of the big draws this election cycle was 
Prop. 19, the initiative to legalize marijuana 
for recreational use.  The proposition lost with 
only 45 percent of the voters supporting it. For 
weeks before the election proponents of Prop. 
19 handed out fliers on Library walk — a cam-
paign that continued even as most students fin-
ished voting.  They were joined alongside oppo-
nents of Prop. 23, which would have repealed 
the Air Pollution Control Law. Voters rejected 
Prop 23 with 61 percent of the vote. 

“It’s fun,” said a long-time poll worker Ricky 
Santos. “One of my favorite things is when we 

New Media Rules Limit Funding to $450 Per Quarter

Media orgs will now be funded no more than 
$450 per quarter, after A.S. Council voted 11-8-
2 to pass new media guidelines at its meeting 
yesterday night. 

In addition to this new funding cap, print 
media within their first year of 
publication will only be given up 
to $200 per quarter. Another pro-
vision requires media orgs to raise 
5 percent of funds from outside 
sources, such as advertising, to 
receive A.S. funding for Spring 
2011, and 25 percent from outside 

sources to receive funding for Fall 2011. 
“We decided on the 5-percent number for 

spring because it’s hard to raise 25 percent so

The San Diego County Medical 
Examiner’s Office has ruled the death of 
a female found in a burning SUV to be 
a case of murder. The body was found in 
the P701 parking lot next to the UCSD 
baseball field on Friday, Oct. 29

An autopsy 
performed on 
Monday, Nov. 1 
determined the 
cause of her death, 
but the San Diego 
Police Department 
will not disclose 
details.

The identity of 
the woman has not 
been established, 
but the registered 

owner of the SUV — who is a female 
resident of Carlsbad — has been missing 
since the night of the incident.

Investigators are trying to locate the

Educating Minds and Hearts to Change The World

PURSUE YOUR
  Master’s Degree

By Aurora Le
Staff Writer

Researchers at the School of 
Medicine have discovered that 
short-term memory remains even 
after brain damage occurs at the area 
responsible for forming memories. 

“The severity of the damage 
depends on how it’s damaged and 
how much it’s damaged,” psychiatry 
and neurosciences professor Larry 
R. Squire said. 

The participants in Squire’s study 
included four patients with damage 
to their medial temporal lobe, or the 
area responsible for forming long-
term memories. The subjects — 
who were aged 49 to 71 — included 
volunteers, patients at the UCSD 
Medical Center and the VA system. 

The experiment was held 
at Squire’s Memory Research 
Laboratory, which studies the 
structures and functions of 
mammalian memory. 

“This study was based on an 
experiment in 1966 where patients 

were asked to repeat back a string of 
numbers,” Squire said. “Patients with 
MTL damage could recall up to six 
digits, but with numbers larger than 
seven digits, severe discontinuity 
became apparent. We used the logic 
of the experiment to form our study.”

The four brain-damaged subjects 
were told to briefly study an array 
of small toys, such as small cars and 
tops, on a table. They then were 
asked to recreate the object’s relative 
positions to each other and their 
results were compared to a control 
group of nine individuals without 
brain damage. The task was self-
paced. 

Patients with MTL damage were 
able to easily replicate the position 
of three objects or less by using 
short-term memory. But when 
asked to remember four or more 
objects, their performance decreased 
because they had to start using long-
term memory

This showed that, despite brain 
damage, patients can still maintain 
working, or short-term, memory. 

Short-term memory is the mental 
ability to remember things for a 
few seconds immediately after 
experiencing (viewing, hearing, 
feeling) them. 

This is because long-term 
memory involves the hippocampus, 
while short-term memories rely on 
supporting brain structures. 

“There has been major confusion 
about distinction about short-
term memory and long-term 
memory,” Squire said. “We chose 
to do this research to clear up this 
misconception. MTL patients are 
impaired even when delays are very 
short, and most cognitive tasks in 
experiments only last one second. 
Short-term memory is not about 
time as much as it is about memory 
capacity — short term does not 
mean short time.”

Short-term memory is dependent 
on the medial temporal lobe. 

However, these patients only 
displayed impairment because 
their memory capacity had 
been exceeded, not because 

they lacked working memory. 
The results were the same for 
all patients, and there were no 
discrepancies between men and 
women.

“This study illuminates how 
the brain accomplishes learning 
and memory by affirming the 
fundamental distinction between 
short-term memory and long-
term memory [and] the specific 
importance of particular brain 
regions for the formation of long-
term memory,” Squire said.

With the heat slowly dying down with the set-ting sun, A.S. Council 
began its Week 6 meeting. Media 
orgs gathered around the public 
seating area to speak their minds 
regarding the new media funding 
protocol that would vote on by 
council members. 
Numerous media 
orgs, including 
the California 
Review, Mania 
Magazine, the 
MQ and the 
Koala, said that 
a funding cap of 
$450 for returning orgs and $200 
for new orgs would not be suf-
ficient to cover basic printing and 
distribution costs.

With a short pause on the issue 
of media, the Finance Committee 
brought forth the approval of the 
2010-11 S.P.A.C.E.S. budget. A call 
to table the budget to next week’s 
meeting was initiated by Warren 
College Senator Kevin Hoang. 
His call was collaborated by VP of 
Finance Andrew Ang, who said 
the budget should be tabled since 
numerous fiscal questions were 
left unanswered by the directors of 
S.P.A.C.E.S. According to Ang, A.S. 
Council’s job is to “monitor their 
[S.P.A.C.E.S.] budget, and has to be 
approved by us.” 

Although A.S. Council has no 
power to change the total alloca-
tion due to it being in place by a 
referendum, council nonetheless 
has the authority to review the 
budget. A.S. President Wafa Ben 
Hassine brought to council’s atten-
tion that the budget had to be 
passed as soon as possible in order 
for S.P.A.C.E.S. to effectively put 
their programs on. 

AVP of  Academic Affairs 

Desiree Prevo, as well as AVP 
Diversity Affairs Alyssa Peace , 
emphasized that Council knew the 
bare minimum regarding the inner 
workings of S.P.A.C.E.S. programs, 
and therefore cannot be in a legiti-
mate position to criticize or re-
structure the funding given to the 

specific programs. 
AVP of Local 
Affairs Matthew 
Vu expressed his 
concern at A.S. 
Council’s desire 
to “microman-
age their budget 
without under-

standing their programs.” Ang reit-
erated that for council to be fiscally 
responsible, it must have answers 
to their questions before approving 
the budget. After a lengthy discus-
sion, council voted to table the 
budget until next week.

And with that conclusion to 
yet another budget discussion, 
A.S. Council transitioned into the 
murky waters of media funding. 
AVP of Student Org Carli Thomas 
said guidelines had brought a wide 
rebuke from media orgs on cam-
pus, as demonstrated during public 
input. Council hashed the issue 
in nearly a two-hour discussion, 
with councilmembers expressing 
concern over the lack of funding. 
Council approved the legislation 
with minor amendments.

A.S. Council passed a resolu-
tion calling for the release of stu-
dent hostages who were detained 
in Iran. With a minor amend-
ment to semantics presented by 
Engineering Senator Adi Singer, 
council passed the resolution.

Ending on a note of global 
humanitarianism, the night came 
to an end.

Stay cool, UCSD.

Extension Program Adds 300 Online Classes
By Kirsten Mauro
Contributing Writer

The UCSD Extension program has 
added over 300 courses to its catalog this 
year, nearly doubling the number of 
online classes offered. 

Extension is a series of courses 
taught at and associated with UCSD, 
though anyone is able to enroll. In the 
past three years, the program has seen 
an 11-percent increase in enrollment, 
with a two-percent growth in 2010.

Classes were also added to expand 
the program’s subject diversity, specifi-
cally for online classes.       

Assistant Dean of the UCSD 
Extension Program Henry DeVries 
said that the recession means graduates 
are eager to find further specialization, 
leading to higher demand for these 
courses. According to him, 85 percent 
of Extension students already have a 
college degree.

“Enrollment is increasing because 
job seekers are unable to find work in 
their preferred fields and they’re going 
back to school to gain experience 
to bridge to areas of higher job demand,” 
DeVries said. “Continuing education 
certificates are an attractive way to 
transition to employment areas like 

health care, information technology or 
green jobs.” 

UCSD Extension’s Director of 
Online Learning Elizabeth Meyer said 
the popularity of online courses is 
growing due to their convenience.

“Online courses are become more 
increasingly accepted as a means for 
education,” Meyer said. 
“These are courses that are 
taught face-to-face but are 
also online;  some of [these 
are]  new courses from the 
ground up. In other words, 
they have not been taught before, 
and some of them are new to online 
because we found that more people 
wanted to take courses online.”

There are three variations of 
online classes offered at UCSD 
Extension: blended, hybrid 
and fully online courses. 
Blended and hybrid courses 
rely on both face-to-face and online 
instruction and have seen a 10-percent 
increase this year in enrollment, while 
fully online courses have expanded by 
38 percent, according to Meyer. 

“In some ways, I think some peo-
ple would say it’s a more engaging 
experience, especially the discussion 
boards,” Meyer said.   “For instance, 

I am getting my masters 
through George Washington 
University, and they timed the 
online discussion and found it was 
equivalent to six hours of talking. In 
a three-hour lecture course, there is no 
way they’re going to have that much 
discussion happening.”

Another component of Extension 
is the network of 700 advisers who 
provide advice to prospective students.

The Extension classes receive 
feedback via student surveys. The 
instructor then reads the evaluation 
forms and incorporates the students’ 
advice for future courses. Last year, a 
group of students filed formal griev-
ances against the Digital Arts Program, 
claiming inadequacy due to an 
unknowledgeable professor. 

The issue was taken over by Head 
of Student Services Elizabeth Silva, who 
offered alternative classes and outside 
help to provide the education the stu-
dents felt they had not received. 

Meyer said that since this 
issue was resolved, there have 
been no more complaints about 
the quality of Extension courses.

find out it’s their first [time] voting, 
especially if they brought their sample 
ballot. We’ve given them standing ova-
tions before.”

But while the propositions and 
gubernatorial nominees drew many 
students, television ads for candidates 
had made some unwilling to vote.

“The candidates were kind of 
annoying,” Eleanor Roosevelt College 
senior Ravi Wettasinghe said. “I made a 
point to not vote for the candidates that 
had a lot of advertising.”

Sixth College senior Neko 
Castleberry said she agreed the adver-
tisements were ineffective. She was also 
distracted by the pressures of exams, a 
concern that kept many students from 
following the campaign. 

“If you watch any TV, they are on 
there but you don’t learn anything from 
the campaign ads,” she said. “Because of 
midterms — I have one today — I don’t 
feel like I know as much as I should.”

While most of the country turned 
to Republican leadership, California 
remained heavily Democratic. 

Democrats won 50 of the contested 
State Assembly seats and 14 of the 
State Senate seats. This is nearly twice 
the amount of Republican wins in the 
Assembly, with 26. The Republicans 
also won less than half the Democratic 
State Senators with just 6 being elected.  
Along with Jerry Brown’s win as gover-
nor and Barbara Boxer defending her 
Senate seat, California became one of 
the bluest states in the country.

Commission on the Future.
“[The UC Commission on the 

Future] has explored ways the uni-
versity can best serve California while 
at the same time maintaining access, 
quality and affordability in an era 
of reduced resources,” the statement 
said.

In the pilot project, 25 courses will 
be taught, at most. UCOP is raising 
external funds to support the pro-
gram which will require a professor, 
course designer and education tech-
nologist to develop courses.

The online courses will have the 
same academic standards, UC fac-
ulty members and graduate student 
instructors as physical classes, accord-
ing to UCOP senior policy advis-

er Christopher Edley at a Regents 
meeting in July. The formula will be 
multi-media and web-based, using 
video, audio-over slides, animations, 
white boards and social networking 
websites. 

Discussions will include online 
chat rooms, discussion boards, desk-
top webinars and video conferences. 
Students will be tested in the same 
manner — with midterms, papers and 
finals — in a secure online environ-
ment with proctors and software. 

The first test courses are scheduled 
to begin by January 2012. All courses 
will be taught at least once before the 
project ends in December 2012. 

The pilot project courses empha-
size classes that are experiencing 
the heaviest demand systemwide. 

They will be subject to the standard 
Academic Senate approval process by 
an advisory panel of UC administra-
tors and Academic Senate members. 

Currently, about 1,200 online 
courses are available through UC 
Extension programs. A total of 55,229 
students are enrolled in these online 
courses. 

In the faculty search, members 
from the 10 campuses are invited to 
submit letters of intent by Dec. 13 
detailing which course they want to 
develop and teach. An interdisciplin-
ary committee will review faculty let-
ters of intent and make recommenda-
tions to UCOP about which proposals 
to plan and implement. 

During the planning phase, the 
faculty chosen to participate will pro-

vide input on the online learning 
environment, course structure and 
evaluation process. 

“The challenge for these partici-
pants will include trying to identify 
what are key ingredients of ‘UC qual-
ity’ and what measurements should 
be used to gauge how much students 
learn in a course,” the statement said.

At the end of the planning phase, 
requests for full proposals will be 
issued in March 2011 and the sub-
mission deadline will be April 2011. 
The committee will begin the imple-
mentation phase, where faculty and 
project staff will develop, start and 
evaluate the online courses.

quickly,” Vice President of Finance and 
Resources Andrew Ang said. “We want 
the media orgs to be self-sustaining, 
not 100-percent dependent on A.S. 
They need to learn to sustain them-
selves and can’t be babied by A.S.”

One amendment to the origi-
nal legislation proposed earlier this 
week allows media orgs to petition 
for money from the annual operat-
ing funds, in addition to the allo-
cated $450. This operating fund sets 
aside $500 per year for all student 
orgs, although being awarded the full 
amount is not guaranteed, Ang said. 

“Media operations have never 
applied for operating funding, but 
do have the opportunity to do so,” 
Associate Vice President of Student 
Orgs Carli Thomas said. “It’ll provide 
up to $500 added to the quarterly 
stipend.” 

Another funding change is that 
papers which receive sponsorship from 
a department or college are eligible for 
up to $200 per quarter in extra alloca-

tions. This money comes from a spe-
cial $1,000 fund set aside by Thomas 
for the new sponsorship program, 
which is meant to encourage papers 
to seek support in the form of advisers. 
Ang said colleges and departments can 
sponsor more than one paper. 

Media org representatives — some 
of which have requested $3,000 per 
quarter in the past —  claimed the caps 
will cripple their publications. 

During the public input period at 
the Nov. 3 meeting, MQ Editor in Chief 
Patrick Reischl said it was upsetting 
that media orgs were not involved in 
creating the new guidelines. 

“If we’re looking for an actual solu-
tion so we don’t have to revisit media 
funding every year, it’d be nice if we 
could get a committee that could talk 
to media orgs, know what it’s like, and 
get some realistic solutions that will last 
us a long time,” Reischl said. 

Saltman Quarterly media specialist 
Katie Frehafer said the cap would have 
far-reaching consequences. 

“I’m speaking for myself, the asso-

ciate dean and the students who work 
on the journal year-round to make this 
possible,” she said. “To see a reactionary 
measure of $450 total per media org 
per quarter is very disheartening, and it 
does not seem to be achieving the aims 
that it’s intended, so I ask that those of 
you who can vote tonight to ask your-
self what you’re voting on.”

During discussion of the legisla-
tion, Campuswide Senator Elizabeth 
Elman proposed several amendments 
to the original version, all of which 
failed. One amendment suggested 
lowering the fundraising threshold 
— the amount orgs must raise from 
outside sources to qualify for A.S. 
funding —from 25 percent to 15 per-
cent or 0 percent.

Elman also suggested changing the 
quarterly stipend to a yearly stipend. 
This would change the funding system  
to an annual system where media orgs 
are given an annual set of money and 
then determine how to use it. 

Thomas said this was unfeasible. 
“I’d love to do yearly funding,” 

Thomas said. “But having money roll 
over from one quarter to another opens 
up a whole can of worms for other orgs 
that would give us no accountability for 
how these orgs are using that funding.” 

Elman then suggested a cap of $900 
dollars for the full year, but Thomas 
said that higher caps would mean that 
some orgs could not be funded. 

“As a council we prioritized student 
org programming over media during 
the budget meeting,” she said. 

California Review Editor in Chief 
Alec Weisman praised the amendment 
that allows media orgs to access operat-
ing funds, but said the media guidelines 
were still unfair. 

“I’d like to work with student media 
to push for more transparency,” he said. 

Thomas said she would revisit the 
caps in the spring and adjust caps for 
2011-12 according to the carryover, or 
the money left at the end of the year.

Garcia-Puente is currently 
unemployed and does not have 
a known vehicle or permanent 
address. He has been known to 
frequent the cities of Carlsbad and 
San Marcos.

“We are not 100 percent sure 
about the identification and that’s 
why we have not released the 
person’s name,” San Diego Police 
Lieutenant Kevin Rooney said. “If 
the registered owner of the car 
is who we think it is, we have 
not established any connection 
between her and the university or 
the hospital on that block.”

Detectives have been staying in 
contact with the family of the vehicle 
owner since her disappearance.

“Keep in mind the victim is 
not positively identified,” Rooney 
said. “Our crime lab will examine 
familial DNA from a family 
member to compare to the DNA 
that was extracted at the autopsy 
in an attempt to match that from a 
family point of view to determine 
if, in fact, it’s the person who’s [the] 
registered owner of the car.”

released a photograph of Garcia-
Puente and shared it with police 
departments in North County.

Online Dating: 
For More 
Than Just the 
Desperate
A few weeks ago, as I sat with my friend watching the Food Network at 4 a.m., it seemed 
that every commercial break includ-
ed an eHarmony or Match.com com-
mercial. Of course Match.com would 
assume that if I was watching the 
Food Network at 4 a.m., I was single. 

Sadly, it was right. And the com-
mercials repeatedly reminded me 
that one in five relationships start 
online and couples in 17 percent of 
marriages in the past three years met 
online. Between the delirium of 4 
a.m., Guy Fieri and the biracial cou-
ple who were “matched in Oct. 2004,” 
my friend and I jokingly decided to 
make online dating profiles. 

But after learning that one month 
of eHarmony costs more than my 
phone bill, we turned to its free 
alternative, OKCupid. 

The first step was to decide 
how best to showcase myself to the 
world of potential mates (aka what 
I should put on my profile). Here, I 
found myself in a dark place that felt 
disgustingly similar to the world of 
college apps. I never thought I’d have 
to fill out another “Self-Summary,” 
“What I’m really Good At” or “What 
I’m Doing With My Life” ever again.  
I thought wrong.

After dutifully putting in what I 
thought to be creative responses, the 
site bombarded me with even more 
questions to increase “match percent-
ages.” Some were relevant, asking if 
I was okay with my significant other 
spending a lot of time with exes (not 
really) but others were less so: “Do 
you believe in dinosaurs?” (um, yes).

Then it was time to decide which 
photo to upload, and here I realized 
that everything I’d just done was 
useless. Who cares who I wrote? We 
all know it all depends on the photo. 
Sun God photos? Nah, I don’t want 
to come off like a crazed partier. 
Family photos? Yeah, right. Too bor-
ing. I finally decided on a picture of 
me and a friend, and (after cropping 
her out) hit “Upload.”  

I started off by filtering through 
(read: blocking) the creepy 40-year-
olds, the creepy cat guy that pokes 
his dead gecko every couple of 
weeks and the overall creeps. I found 
that it’s a lot easier to reject people 
online. And hey, that Chris* guy 
is cute and doesn’t off any weirdo 
alarms. 

After the sifting through the ini-
tial weirdos, I was surprised to find 
that most of the guys weren’t social 
outcasts, or awkward pariahs, but 
regular dudes that were either new 
to the area or tired of the party scene 
— and who could blame them? 
Meeting new people is hard.

But online dating isn’t all that 
different from meeting someone 
at a party. You go on there to get 
away from the requisite awkward 
mingling, but it turns out online 
dating is just as shallow — in fact, 
online, appearances count more. You 
don’t have the opportunity to dazzle 
people with your in-person wit, so 
that profile pic better be well-lit and 
from a good angle. And with that 
said, you can assume that everyone’s 
about 33-percent hotter in their pro-
file picture than in real life.

New Funding Guidelines Force Media Orgs to Leave the Nest for Full 
Control of  Funds.

This is Your Cue to Fly the Coop

EDITORIALÊBOARD

The UCSD Guardian is published twice a week at 
the University of California at San Diego. Contents 

© 2010. Views expressed herein represent the 
majority vote of the editorial board and are not 

necessarily those of the UC Board of Regents, the 
ASUCSD or the members of the Guardian staff. 

After being at the beck and call of A.S. Council for the past two years, it’s time for media orgs to fly the coop 
and stand on their own two feet. Last year, the 
orgs fell victim to a council that froze their funding 
despite them having done (mostly) nothing wrong. 
They were then welcomed back with open arms 
and rewarded with an exorbitant allowance for their 
trouble. Now broke, councilmembers have passed 
new media funding guidelines that turn the student 
publications out again. These media orgs need to 
stop putting the existence of their publications in 
the hands of people who don’t know what InDesign 
is, and eliminate the uncertainty of relying on the 
whims of a fickle VP Finance and Resources.

Last Spring Quarter, 
council a passed a $60,000 
media budget for the year. 
As the dust of the Compton 
Cookout and the media fund-
ing freeze was still settling, 
VP of Finance and Resources 
Andrew Ang — who was 
burned earlier after trying 
to impose new “guidelines” 
that smacked of censorship — 
allocated funds based on that 
number, liberally gifting some 
of the higher-end publications 
as much as $3,400 to last 
them through Fall Quarter. 

At the first sign of budget 
cuts, the $60,000 was slashed 
down to $38,000 — a serious 
problem, considering Ang had 
already dished out $26,000 for 
Fall Quarter. Now, new guide-
lines cap funding for each 
org at $450 per org per quarter, striking a hard blow 
for our publications who are used to, as Ang put it, 
“being babied by A.S.”

This cripples the orgs. Whereas even the cheapest 
of productions — the Public Policy Journal at UCSD 
— received $800 this quarter, all media orgs will have 
to make due with $450 a quarter through Spring 
Quarter 2011. The guidelines also stipulate that in 
order to qualify for this funding, the media orgs must 
start looking to outside sources for money. And else-
where — meaning fiscal independence via a pool of 
money just for media orgs — is the answer. 

We get it. Council is between a rock and a hard 
place, and a cap on spending isn’t a bad plan in itself. 
Last year, councilmembers made it rain for No. 15 
magazine by allocating $9,000 to the production of 
a single issue — and though we love artistic displays 
of food on naked bodies  as much as the next person, 
$9,000 really is overkill.

Still, council shouldn’t have cut the budget so dras-
tically to begin with. The council has nearly free reign 
when it comes to allocating their $2 million a year. 
But while Sun God Festival’s $500,000 budget remains 
mostly untouched, the student publications are forced 
to limp along a budget that wouldn’t sustain even the 
cheapest of them. Associate Vice President of Student 
Orgs Carli Thomas even said that the council priori-
tizes programming over media orgs. 

The council knew what it was doing when it took 
$22,000 from the media funding allocations last 
week. By the time the budget hit the table, the money 
for Fall Quarter had already been handed off to the 

media orgs. Expecting the publications to fall on the 
sword for A.S. Council’s past and present mistakes is 
unfair.

But what’s done is done and, as Ang touts his 
favorite buzz words of “fiscally responsible,” money 
can’t come from nowhere. This turn of events might 
be just the catalyst the media orgs need to break free 
from A.S. Council and control their own money. A 
recurring complaint among the media orgs is that 
the council decides how to allocate, but supposedly 
doesn’t how to run a media org, or know the differ-
ence between the cheapest newsprint and glossiest 
magazine paper. 

A referendum would put power in the hands of 
the media orgs. Instead of giving our fickle govern-

mental mastheads the discretion to 
fund media orgs whatever portion of 
that $2 million they see fit, students 
would pay fees into an account des-
ignated just for the media orgs — an 
account council couldn’t touch. A 
media org board — filled with mem-
bers that know just what goes into 
that 12-page black-and-white labor of 
love — would be in charge of allocat-
ing among themselves. The media org 
editors who deal with these questions 
firsthand are far more qualified to 
pronounce judgement on a magazine’s 
requested budget than a council with a 
limited knowledge of printing costs and 
Photoshop.

Passing the referendum won’t be an 
easy feat — the sponsors will be just 
another in the long string  of depart-
ments and orgs coming to council with 
outstretched hands (yes, Loft, we’re 
looking at you). But provided the ref-

erendum passes, this means no more fear of media 
freeze, or unsympathetic financial controllers. No 
more council protests over the importance of free 
speech and how publications compare to tradition or 
cultural events. The referendum would provide media 
orgs with a set funds that wouldn’t vanish due to dis-
organized or confused budgeting.

But at most, a referendum will only go into effect 
next year and doesn’t provide any short-term answers 
for how an org used to $3,000 in funding will limp by 
with (up to) $450. But it’ll be a start.   

When media orgs aren’t a priority, continuing to 
depend on mommy-and-daddy council for an allow-
ance every quarter will constrict funds and create 
headaches. If media orgs have the courage to stand on 
their own two feet, and the luck to get a referendum 
passed by the students come April, the A.S. Council’s 
training wheels will fall away in favor of a much 
more stable ride.

Props to San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors for requiring kids meals 
meet certain nutritional standards before being sold with toys.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
Recently, I have come under much 

attention and scrutiny from those who 
heard of my involvement in being a 
principal member in 80 new media 
organizations. I would like to take this 
opportunity to explain some things.

My opinion of the Koala is no 
secret. I look forward to the day they 
no longer receive student funding. 
The main purpose of this plan for me 
(I will not speak for everyone who 
was involved in creating and joining 
the orgs, although the Oct. 28 article 
by the Guardian described this as my 
“brainchild”) was to take the argu-
ments of “viewpoint neutrality” that 
we all heard so much of last year and 
show how that model can be abused 
— whether by the Koala or by new 
“illegitimate” orgs. It was interesting 
to see the complete roundabout from 
individuals who argued for viewpoint 
neutrality one year, then wanted to 
define “legitimacy” the next.

If all 80-something orgs were to 
receive funding, it would be abusing a 
broken system. Would I be happy with 
that? No. It defeats the purpose of call-
ing the system out in the first place. 
Had we received funding, I would 
have lost all hope for the world.

The overreaction by some was 
unfortunate, (130-pound A.S. 
members getting shoved, front page 
Guardian articles, getting bashed by 
California Review) especially since we 
only had three people take part, with 

four being minimum to create an org.
And no, SAAC absolutely had 

no part in this. Sure, I used the list-
serv to find out if people were down 
(to which they declined), but by no 
means was this some secretive plan 
orchestrated by SAAC. It’s unfortunate 
that it seems I cannot act as an indi-
vidual independent of my ties with 
other organizations. Sorry, California 
Review! I know you got excited when 
you thought you intercepted a “leaked 
e-mail.” I hate to break your hearts, 
but that e-mail was very public.

Let’s face it: Koala fan or not, the 
system is broken. Council knows that 
now. At least some important discus-
sions have begun and there’s less, if any, 
room for abuse in the future. If any-
thing, you all should be thanking us.

With that said, there is no longer 
a need to continue with the 80 some-
thing media organizations. Not that it 
even matters since we only had three 
people, I plan to withdraw my name 
(painstakingly one by one) from the 
media organizations. There is no need 
for a “hostage situation” now that 
progress is sure to take place.

With Photoshop, You Can Put Your Best Face Forward

DRAWING FIRE By Johan De La Torre

To test just how much looks 
matter online, I created two identi-
cal profiles with two very different 
pictures of me. Unsurprisingly, the 
frumpier profile’s inbox was left 
bare, while the “cuter” profile was 
bombarded with messages. 

And for some bizarre reason, 
guys think that posting multiple 
shirtless pictures of their abs — 
without their faces — is the key to 
reeling in a girl. Think again, boys.

So anyway, there was Chris. 
With Halloween right around the 
corner, I figured it wouldn’t hurt to 
invite him to a costume party. 

And if he turned out to be a 
creep, it wouldn’t be too difficult to 
disappear into the masses. 

After awkward introductions, it 
turns out that we had a lot in com-
mon. 

Aside from a certain A.S. sena-
tor stealing his attention for an 
hour-long engineering chat, I’d say 
the night was a success. 

Every month, 20 million people 
date online, but though everyone 
seems to know someone who 
found their “someone” online, 
online daters are stigmatized as 
chumps who can’t get a date on 
their own. 

If anything, for some, online 
dating is more a booty call rou-
lette wheel than a retreat of social 
rejects. And no matter how obvi-
ous it seems, always meet “friends” 
you’ve met online in a public place, 

and — no matter how embarrass-
ing — give a friend their number, 
just in case. 

Online dating isn’t for every-
one, but in the end, most members 
are normal people trying to find 
someone. 

And because finding a date 
at UCSD that doesn’t only speak 
science or reek of bro is next to 
impossible, online dating is a 
viable option to weed out the less 
than desirable suitors. 

I don’t think I’ll snag my dream 
man on OKCupid anytime soon, 
but the site did reaffirm the cliche: 
There are literally thousands of 
other fish in the sea. If one doesn’t 
work out, there are hundreds of 
others a click away.

TONIGHT

Expect Lemon, 
Not Cosmos
A s a female attending a competitive university, it’s hard not to fanta-size about living the “Desperate 
Housewives” dream post- graduation: 
fabulous shoes, a high-stakes career (or 
perfect family) and a model boyfriend. 
Unfortunately, not everyone is Carrie 
Bradshaw — a fact made humorously 
evident on NBC’s “30 Rock.” 

For this reason, “30 Rock” should be 
a show on more women’s radars. Sure, 
there’s no fist-pumping guidos, snarky 
vampires or musically gifted high school 
students, and the actors are neither 
young nor Hollywood-beautiful. Yet 
in its four years on the air the comedy 
has accumulated a stack of awards and 
high-profile guest stars that would make 
your head spin, so the cast must be doing 
something right. 

It was partly my urge to solve this 
mystery appeal that got me to watch “30 
Rock.” But the major reason I tuned in 
was because I was told the main char-
acter was exactly like me in 15 years. 
Naturally I was excited to follow the life 
of a beautiful, successful blonde with 
sparkling wit and charm. 

My ego met quite a blow, however, 
as did my post-grad ideal. Instead of a 
bombshell, “30 Rock” features a frizzy- 
haired, collared shirt- and cardigan-
wearing Liz Lemon (played by Tina Fey), 
head writer of a fictional NBC program 
similar to SNL. Liz works tirelessly to 
keep her writers and actors from run-
ning the show into the ground, while 
managing her own life as a late thirty-
something, unmarried woman in New 
York City. Her job is thankless and her 
love life a wreck, but Liz has a spark that 
drives her to do better and try harder, 
and I respect that. So although her life 
isn’t perfect, and mine won’t be either, it’s 
nice to see it’s not all bad.

I did, however, purchase a hair 
straightener before Netflix finished buff-
ering episode two.

Sharing the spotlight with Fey is Alec 
Baldwin, who I always thought of as the 
creepiest of the Baldwin brothers, until 
I saw him in the role of Jack Donaghy. 
His wit is as dry as it is cynical, and his 
delivery is flawless, providing a perfect 
foil for Liz’s own brand of laughably 
awkward comedy. The two first meet in 
the pilot, and after an initial clash of per-
sonalities, begin to develop a relationship 
that’s based in the work environment, 
though it becomes much more personal 
over time. For awhile, the show seemed 
to toy with the idea of Liz and Jack as a 
potential romance, but the addition of 
various other love interests for each (like 
Carol, the airline pilot, who reveals Matt 
Damon to be a closet comedic genius) 
prove much more entertaining. 

Good thing too, as neither Lack nor 
Jiz is much of a couple nickname. It 
seems Jack and Liz will never be more 
than freakishly codependent friends, but 
that’s okay, because too much relation-
ship drama and we wind up with “Grey’s 
Anatomy.” The world only needs one of 
those. Or better yet, none at all.

By the time Thursday night rolls 
around, I’m pretty burnt out. We all 
know that nasty Thursday evening feel-
ing, and just about everyone could use a 
good laugh before tackling Friday classes. 
So girls, turn away from your “Sex and 
the City” box set for a second and set 
your sights on a more realistic funny-
lady to distract you from midterms. 
Samantha may be getting laid more, but 
Liz Lemon can take Alec Baldwin down, 
and that is way cooler.

A Little Past 
Its Due Date
By Neda Salamat
Associate Hiatus Editor

I n “The Hangover,” Todd Philips couples unlikely scenarios, people and drugs in Sin City, lending the movie an unpolished charm absent from clumsy 
kid-brother attempt “Due Date.”  It’s the ‘09 hit recy-
cled, a “Planes, Trains and Automobiles” rehash, with 
only glimmers of either’s intricacy or precise timing, a 
reminder that the best thoughtless slapstick comedy is, 
in fact, rarely thoughtless.

Dressed to the nines, manic-perfectionist father-
to-be Peter Highman (Robert Downey Jr.) is stressin’ 
— his baby drops in less than a week and he’s hundreds 
of miles away. En route to the airport, Peter collides 
with the physical manifestation of a train wreck —

I t’s a Bay Area thing.” That’s the extent of what most out-of-towners at this year’s San Francisco Treasure Island Festival have heard about Wallpaper — the Oakland-based, over-the-top party-funk duo. Maybe 
that’s because their performance is so difficult to describe: a Justin 
Timberlake doppelganger for a singer, some serious grooves with influ-
ences ranging from the ‘70s to today, a goddamn six-piece African per-
cussion ensemble and — most elusive in the age of indie rock — a whole 
lot of white people dancing. 

The first noticeable characteristic of Wallpaper mastermind Eric 
Frederic is his sense of humor. And with his track record, why not? It 

even comes out in his song titles, like “I Got Soul, I’m So Wasted” and 
“Doodoo Face” (the title track of his latest LP). His remix of Jay-Z’s 
“Death Of Autotune” douses the rapper’s all-too-serious attack on super-
ficiality in schmaltzy synthesizer and — you guessed it — autotune. But 
the comedy never subtracts from the music; Wallpaper’s half-winking 
parody only makes the throwback grooves that much more irresistible. 

Frederic took time off from his current tour to talk to The Guardian 
about his past, his future and the funky good times to be had at 
Wallpaper’s upcoming performance in San Diego. 

 
The Guardian: Could you give us an idea of what Wallpaper is?

Eric Frederic: Wallpaper began as a sort of pop satire that eventually 
evolved into the thing it was mocking. It’s influenced by everything 

from ‘70s funk to ‘80s pop to ‘90s gangster rap, and the band 
is fronted by Ricky Reed — a living, breathing, sexing party 

machine. 
G: Ricky Reed, your alter ego?

EF: That’s correct. 
G: Is there a collaboration between 

the split personalities, or is it more of a 
Jekyll-Hyde situation?
EF: Ricky, he’s a dude — not me. I 
graduated with a degree in music com-

position from UC Berkeley. I am a super 
music nerd, really into the composition 

and theory of music. That’s definitely 
not Ricky Reed. He’s more 

of a lazy, womanizing 
weirdo — with a 
good sense of humor 
— who comes in 
and does all the 
vocals.
G: Wallpaper 
seems to have a 
pretty religious 
local following. 
Would you say 
Wallpaper is a 
Bay Area band?

we were for 
a long time, 

because that’s 
where I grew

One Track Mind

M egamind” is your typical story — the hero and antihero live parallel child-hoods, grow up to become each 
other’s arch nemeses and wage war for 
control of a generic urban center (in this 
case, the aptly named Metro City.)  But the 
movie doesn’t suffer much from its ho-hum 
premise — the flick’s class-A cast and clean-
cut animation lend it a winning charm that 
powers through the dopey premise and 
occasional plot pitfalls.

We’re introduced to the film’s lead-
ing men: the dashing, dimpled and 
coiffed Metro Man (Brad Pitt), who fre-
quently thwarts the clumsily inept villain, 
Megamind (Will Farrell). Megamind’s plans 
usually consist of ill-conceived schemes, 
which rarely achieve anything more than 
pissing off kidnap victim and local reporter 
Roxanne Ritchi (Tina Fey).  Then, as a 

fluke, Megamind destroys the dapper 
Metro Man and finds himself faced with 
a dilemma: an excess of free time. Feeling 
blue, he sets out to create a new super-
hero from Ritchi’s doting cameraman, Hal 
(Jonah Hill), triggering a revolving door of 
heroism where every character gets a turn 
to play the good guy. 

From his dramatic Dracula-esque cos-
tume fixings and spandex to his unapolo-
getically badass landing strip of facial hair, 
the chief villain’s character design emanates 
evil, but it’s Farrell who breathes personal-
ity into this powder-blue criminal. Farrell’s 
performance is heroic; he cackles in a tense, 
pompous accent that contrasts nicely to 
Pitt’s suave drawl. Likewise, Fey’s talent is 
equally well placed as the sharp and sar-
castic Ritchi, who lampoons the overdone 
comic book formula (“Can someone stamp 

my frequent kidnapping card?”).
The plot’s overall effect is surprising — 

grown-ups will get a kick out of a storyline 
that turns the typical good vs. evil para-
digm inside out, but tykes might be left in 
the dust.  Characters each have their turn 
playing villain, and though “Megamind” 
delivers its happily ever after, the youngest 
moviegoers might lose track of who they 
should cheer for.

But “Megamind” isn’t completely devoid 
of kiddy charm. Child geeks will rejoice 
— the sci-fi gadgets in this flick may be 
numerous, and structurally improbable 
(what the hell is a dehydration gun?), but 
they add to the film’s novelty. 

The film’s animation mixes with the 
script’s quirky personalities to create an 

P unk, new wave and horn-rimmed glasses: That’s how we know Elvis Costello. But since the ‘90s, 
Costello has been experimenting with 
more styles than we can keep up with 
and his newest album, National Ransom, 
is no exception. 

Costello and producer T Bone 
Burnett fuse nearly every traditional 
American genre, from blues in songs 
like “My Lovely Jezebel” and rockabilly 
in country-rock track “I Lost You” to 
crooner melodies in “A Voice In The 
Dark.” It would sound like authentic 
Americana if it weren’t for, you know, 
that British accent.  

Title track “National Ransom,” along 
with the album’s cover — which features 
a well-dressed Wall Street wolf toting 
a suitcase of burning money — is as 
strong a piece of social commentary as 
when Costello criticized former Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher’s adminis-
tration in 1989.  Both Costello’s cover 
art and lyrics are a barefaced critique 
of the economic situation that we dug 
ourselves into. Plus, the rollicking rock 
track — with the addition of ex-Attrac-
tions bandmate Steve Nieve’s organ — 
almost feels like an early Costello hit.

But there aren’t many more 
throwbacks to Elvis Costello and the 
Attractions’ classics. The majority of 

the album is spent indulging the song-
writer’s obscure musical obsessions. “A 
Voice In The Dark” gives us Costello 
as a crooner out of the days of Tin Pan 
Alley. At one moment we hear Bing 
Crosby-esque deep trembles backed by 
light and quick violins, and in the next 
instant Costello’s familiar nasal drone 
takes over.

Costello’s voice wavers from deep, 
heart-wrenching tones to upbeat coun-
try staccatos in “A Slow Drag With 
Josephine,” which gives us one of the 
songwriter’s many character sketches of 
a woman facing betrayal.  In essence, 
the whole album is a collection of such 
vintage odes, offering a taste of heart-
ache from a distant time.  

National Ransom is a real culmina-
tion of Elvis Costello’s 30-plus years of 
performance and artistry, but unlike 
his Attractions’ glory days, the album 
is more of a time-traveling journey 
through American musical history. 
Nonetheless, fans of rock ’n’ roll’s begin-
nings certainly won’t be able to pass it 
up. 

But here’s fair warning: Don’t go 
expecting “Pump It Up.” The horn-
rimmed glasses may still be there, but 
the new wave sure ain’t.

ALBUMREVIEWS

up and that’s the scene I know and 
love. But the first time we played in 
Philly, we were surprised to get that 
same vibe. People were just really 
engaged and dancing in this let-it-
all-hang-loose atmosphere. Then 
the same thing starting popping 
up in San Diego and then in, like, 
Springfield, Missouri — anywhere 
that people were able to be open 
and honest with themselves and get 
down. 
G: New York too. I know you gained 
some notoriety for your remix of 
“Combination Pizza Hut and Taco 
Bell” from Brooklyn’s Das Racist — 
a runaway hit last summer. How’d 
you get involved with that?
EF: Well I know [Himanshu Suri 
and Victor Vazquez] from Das 
Racist. They’re awesome. I heard 
that song about two years ago and 
I knew it was an amazing song and 
that I had to remix it. It took a few 
months for the remix to catch on 
after that. The funny thing about 
them is their other stuff is so incred-
ible — they’re so much better than 
that one stray song.
G: Where’d the title for your latest 
album, Doodoo Face, come from?
EF: If you Google image search 
someone like James Brown or Bootsy 
Collins playing live, you’ll find them 
making this face that’s all scrunched 
up like they just smelled a little 
doodoo. It’s the face you make when 
something is just super duper funky. 
Unbelievably funky, even. 
G: To the point where you lose con-

trol of muscle function?
EF: Right. Funk players, gospel play-
ers, blues — when it’s something 
real nasty you’ll see them yank that 
face. That very special face. Doodoo 
face. 
G: But in addition to the retro funk 
vibes, there’s a lot of autotune on 
the album, which a lot of artists like 

Jay-Z are starting to question the 
validity of. What draws you to it?
EF: When I started Wallpaper it 
was all satire. Back then, autotune 
was known mostly in the music 
industry as the ‘Cher Effect’ because 
she used it in “Believe.” I wanted my 
voice to sound as mechanical and 
removed from the song as possible, 
so we cranked it up on the songs 
and I thought, “Wow, this sounds 
so cool and it gets my point across.” 
I totally thought I was going to be 
the guy who breaks this thing, you 
know? Of course, that is not what 
happened. I remember the first time 
I heard that E-40 song on the radio, 

I called my mom saying, ‘Oh shit. 
This guy’s doing exactly what I’m 
doing. He’s using autotune, and this 
is going to be huge.’ And of course, it 
is fucking huge. But to tell the truth, 
I don’t use it at all anymore. 
G: So you’re going in a new direc-
tion with the next album? 
EF: Well [with] everything I do, I try 
to push what I’ve done even further. 
While a lot of Doodoo Face was over 
the top, musically it was very mini-
mal, very arranged. Now I feel like 
my patience for subtlety has worn 
thin. Everything I’m doing now is 
just meaner, louder, nastier — if you 
thought it was over the top before, 
now it’s so over the top that it’s fuck-
ing under the bottom. 
G: I’m really looking forward to it. 
Anything else you’d like to share 
with UCSD?
EF: San Diego is one of the best 
places for our shows. The crowd is 
always excited and young and just 
really getting down. If you want to 
mingle and meet members of the 
opposite sex, or really get into some 
loud, live music, you need to roll 
out. I know we need to come to 
UCSD. I don’t know if we’re in your 
guys’ radar, but we’d love to get in it. 
G: Our Sun God Festival in spring, 
maybe?
EF: Shit, we’ll even do some house 
shows, we don’t care. Put in a good 
word for us — we want to get all up 
in UCSD’s butt.

FILMREVIEW



10ÊTHE UCSD GUARDIANÊ THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 2010Ê HIATUS

Hollywood-hopeful Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis) and 
his French bulldog. In true Murphy’s Law fashion, the two 
find themselves seated beside each other on a flight back to 
Los Angeles and (much to Peter’s escalating dismay) wind up 
on the airport’s no-fly list.  After glossing over a series of logic 
missteps, Peter — out of options, money and quickly losing 
time — accepts Ethan’s offer to carpool cross-country.  A host 
of unlikely shenanigans ensue, mostly brought on by Ethan’s 
aggravated levels of idiocy, as the triad race to the City of 
Angels.

Unfortunately, Philip’s latest suffers from an inferiority 
complex, ironically brought by the director’s own voracious 
unwillingness to stray from a once-winning formula. It’s not 
that “Due Date” is intrinsically unpleasant to watch — the 
argumentative banter between the movie’s leading men is, for 
the most part, successful in its haphazard humor. Ethan’s insults 
are mostly unpracticed and accidental, while Peter’s have a pre-
meditated bite — highlighting the characters’ stark differences.  

But without Las Vegas’ lights and wild nights, incredible 
scenarios lose believability, and Ethan’s overly characterized 
one-man dumbass variety hour shackles the film. His escalat-
ing asinine behavior is responsible for a totaled Subaru, an 
accidental trip to the Mexican border and a disgusted/beaten 

up/arrested/shot Peter. After so many minutes of this, the car 
begins to collapse in on itself, and despite Galifianakis’ inher-
ent charm, begins to feel claustrophobically minuscule to both 
Peter and the audience. The need to escape, by any means nec-
essary, becomes overwhelming. 

It’s a shame; pairing the tense, explosive Downey and loose-
cannon Galifianakis should be the perfect balance of the bit-
ter and ludicrous. Galifianakis is all hippy gauche and belly 
flab — touting a butt-faced masturbating pug and a coffee can 
full of his father’s ashes, while frequently complaining about 
his faux-glaucoma. The actor’s well-reprised performance as a 
bearded, fumbling savant has never been so overwhelmingly 
loud — or bearded. It’s a wonder Downey’s persona survived at 
all. Saddled with Ethan’s considerable weight, the actor could 
have easily crumbled under his partner’s far more dynamic 
and colorful personality. Instead, Downey keeps stride, white-
lipped, flying into red rages with remarkable rigidity, spitting 
curses and frequently (as is the case when traveling alongside 
Ethan) blood.

The joke is on Philips. While Downey and Galifianakis 
escape largely unscathed from the gambit — if not better for 
it — the director’s unwillingness to change his formula doesn’t 
allow the men’s personalities to fit into the film’s much-needed 
sense of urgency. Their cross-country destination is lost in 
crude attempts at last-ditch humor. 

I n latest project Cardiology, pop-punk group Good Charlotte 
devotes an entire album to 
the inner workings of the 
heart. But after hearing 
15 tracks worth of lyrics 
like “this feeling’s legit” 
and “she sounds like sex 
on the radio,” it’s doubt-
ful whether the band has 
emotional sides of their 
personas at all.

With few exceptions 
(like on throwback track 
“Silver Screen Romance”), 
Good Charlotte’s lyrics 
move on from the usual 
faux-punk lines about the 
agony of youth and the 
power of material wealth. 
Every song on the album 
is about love, yet not one 
reveals anything especially 
profound on the overused 
subject. 

Cardiology essentially 
contains masculine, tat-
tooed versions of T-Swift’s 
whiny pop songs, thinly 
masked by the nasally 
voice of Joel Madden and 
an abundant sprinkle of 
stale, amateur guitar solos. 
Although some tunes have 
catchy choruses, nothing 
stands out like the rebel-
lious mall-punk anthem 
“Lifestyles of the Rich and 
Famous” did. 

With the addition 
of “Standing Ovation,” 

there is one unexpected 
(though not necessarily 
good) surprise. The track 
harkens to Swift yet again, 
with country-rock guitars, 
saccharine vocals and 
prom-worthy lyrics about 
“making the most of every 
moment.” 

The structure of the 
album includes an intro-
duction, interlude and 
conclusion, meant to tie 
the tracks together and 
make the album seem 
more meaningful than it 
actually is. The introduc-
tion makes little to no 
sense, and lyrically tries to 
explain the mystery, tech-
nology and ancient history 
of cardiology — whatever 
that means.  The conclu-
sion is perhaps the most 
annoying of all — a nearly 
three-minute hymn-like 
expansion of the intro, 
complete with realistic 
heart sound effects. 

Despite such bombas-
tic experiments, Good 
Charlotte falls into the 
mainstream pitfall of 
singing about love and 
romance without actu-
ally saying much at all. 
Cardiology just tries — and 
fails — to disguise it in the 
form of a concept record.

aesthetic that glows, snaps and shines with 
effort, which helps to realize improbabilities 
like large-scale explosions and armies of pygmy 
robots.  

And while even a kid’s action flick neces-
sitates a degree of violence, “Megamind” rarely 
surpasses mischief and slapstick. Dreamworks 
really did try to make this endeavor as whole-
some as possible — characters even avoid the 
dreaded “d” word: die.

For those of us who don’t need a booster 
seat, there are enough funnies littered through-
out to keep you upright. There’s a surprising 
number of references that youngsters will 
completely miss out on, including allusions to 
President Barack Obama. Sadly, the film’s jokes 
grow sparse as the action builds.

Had “Megamind” been with blessed with 
unrestricted reign — rather than being boxed 
by the limitations of a children’s film — the 
tipping point between good and evil would 
have served as interesting societal commen-
tary. Instead, the film remains a trite, though 
humorous, venture. And, thankfully, with two 
SNL alums in the driver’s seat, we somehow 
pull through.

Matt and Kim
Sidewalks
FADER

E very indie-dance party playlist from this moment forth should consist of Brooklyn duo Matt and Kim. The New Yorkers have pro-duced the ultimate toe-tapping, rump-shaking music in their third 
album release, Sidewalks. But if you’re not planning on using it as the 
soundtrack to a night of liquored-up getting down, you might wonder 
if you’ve been listening to the same song for the whole damn album. 

While the duo originally burst on the indie scene with the success 
of “Daylight” from previous album Grand, keyboardist Matt Johnson 
and drummer Kim Schifino’s over-enthusiastic vocals fall short of 
drawing equal hype this time around. 

Sidewalks doesn’t contain thought-provoking lyrics or meaningful 
chorus lines. Nonetheless, piano-laced singalong numbers like first sin-
gle “Cameras” and opening track “Block After Block” make up a little 
for the lack of depth, even with shallow lyrics like, “Eat when you’re 
hungry and sleep when you’re slipping.”

In fact, the only reason to buy this album would be to add it to your 
playlist of songs for doing mundane activities that need a little more 
effervescence. Or if you feel like listening to 35 minutes of hyper key-
boarding and the same recurring construction of vocals and uninspired 
choruses (for this, check out “Where You’re Coming From”). The clap-
ping of hands and beating of drums are merely used as tools to distract 
the listeners from realizing that these are almost identical to the previ-
ous and following songs. 

This album, and more specifically fun dance songs like “Wires” and 
“Red Paint,” will become a part of our guilty-pleasure music category. 
If the overly sugarcoated and syrupy songs are played enough, expect 
cavities and the feeling you had when you sat around the Kumbaya 
campfire in sixth grade.

Blow Your Head Vol. 1: Diplo Presents Dubstep
MAD DECENT

W ith Blow Your Head Vol.1: Diplo Presents Dubstep, DJ Diplo is caught red-handed trying to make a quick buck off the growing popularity of the electronic dance music phenomenon. 
Aside from attempting to promote his brand, Diplo’s goal here was 

to introduce his dubstep-illiterate fans to a new style while taking an 
abbreviated crack at it himself. With the exception of a couple new 
Diplo collaborations, most notably with an equally guilty Lil Jon, the 
album is nothing more than a collection of some of the more main-
stream-friendly classics from the genre.

Diplo somewhat redeems himself with the Lil Jon collaboration 
“U Don’t Like Me.” The track pours on enough earthshaking bass 
lines to get your whole body vibrating, while Lil Jon’s patented rav-
ings make it seem like you’ve never left the Top 40 for the under-
ground. 

The second collaboration, titled “Sunset” and put together with 

dubstep producer Borgore, starts off serenely before exploding into a 
filthy orgy of searing bass-lines that veers dangerously close to ran-
dom noise. 

After the two collaborations, the album merely compiles an 
assortment of older dubstep tracks and does some halfhearted 
remixes. The deejay focuses on the less grimy aspects of the genre; 
the tracks generally feature more vocals than might be found on a 
typical dubstep album. The songs feel less like dubstep and more like 
your basic club anthems. DJ Diplo is clearly trying to water down 
the genre for the masses and promote his own brand with minimum 
effort, to the consternation of diehard aficionados everywhere already 
taking issue with the track listing. You’re better off exploring the 
genre for free on Pandora.

similar stats. The Chargers are 3-5 while the 
Patriots — not in the top five of offensive or 
defensive categories — nevertheless look their 
best since their dominance in 2007 at 6-1. 

It’s not for lack of talent that the Chargers fail 
time and again. At certain points in their games, 
there are brilliant plays with Mike Tolbert or 
Antonio Gates making beautiful catches, and 
the offensive line giving Philip Rivers years 
to pass the ball. But after those brilliant plays 
there comes disaster after disaster, giving the 
Chargers opponents an eight differential in 
turnovers so far this year — the worst ratio in 
the league — along with the most fumbles at 12. 

That’s why good old coach Norv Turner has 
imposed a “no turnovers” credo.

“If you have a guy that touches the ball 30 
times, he’s not allowed to fumble the football,” 
he said. “That’s it.” 

Turner wants the Chargers to be a great 
team, and if they’re going to pull it off they need 
to get their heads back in the game.

Two weeks ago, rookie receiver Richard 
Goodman caught a ball and fell down to the 
ground where “[he] could have sworn [he] was 
touched,” and he put the ball on the ground. 
The trouble is, he wasn’t, and the Pats’ James 

Sanders scooped it and went 25 yards the other 
way. Later in the second quarter, Rivers’ back-
wards pass was left on the ground — a present 
like manna from heaven — and the Pats took 
it down the field for a field goal. The Chargers 
tried to come back from behind, outscoring the 
Pats 17-3 in the fourth quarter, but they were 
already so far behind from their horrible turn-
overs in the first half it didn’t make a difference.

Last week, the Bolts finally got another win 
against the Titans. Why? Sure, they held the ball 
for 15 more minutes and 60 more total yards 
of offense, but the real reason is that they only 
had one turnover and managed to limit that 
turnover’s damage. 

Forcing turnovers and capitalizing on them 
makes a team great, and if the Chargers can 
stop handing the ball to the other team and 
start getting some of what they’ve been giving 
out, they still have a wisp of a hope of a dream 
for this coming post-season. For every San 
Diego Charger fan’s cardiac health, I hope the 
Chargers can play to the whistle, not fumble, 
and become the team their offensive and defen-
sive stats say they can be. The only thing they 
seem to be missing is what any high school 
football player can do: Fight like hell and hold 
on to the ball.

in the fourth quarter.
“We had to really play until the last second,” 

Wylie said. “They started to fall apart and feel 
desperate. Still, they had a couple of opportunities 
to tie the game and go ahead, so we really had to 
keep playing.”

UCSD held on for the victory, and with it, 
became the first Division-II squad to reach 
the NCAA Championship match. Though the 
Tritons would lose that game to UCLA, the win 
against USC became representative of UCSD’s 
transformation into a top-level program. Jason 
Boettner and Jonathan Samuels joined Wylie on 
the Division-I All-American team that year, and 
were the only players given the honors from a 
Division-II school.

Wylie and several of his teammates choose 
UCSD despite offers from the big-name schools.

“You get an immediate feel at some of the 
other schools,” Wylie said. “You get the feeling 
that it’s a business; you’re a number and that’s it. 
That was different at UCSD. They took the time to 
get to know us and it’s just a completely different 
feel. That’s an atmosphere that starts with Denny 
[Harper] and ends with Denny. When I was cap-
tain, he stayed out of it. If there were big issues he 
would get involved, but anything small, he wasn’t 
interested in it.”

The team has stayed close, and many of the 
players still play together in the Sunset San Diego 
Water Polo Club, which Harper also coaches. 

“We go to tournaments together and we play 
polo,” Wylie said. “Obviously it’s not as competi-
tive, but that’s helped us stay in touch.”

1991 Women’s Water Polo

UCSD formed its first women’s 
water polo team in 1985, a full 16 years 
before the NCAA made it an offi-
cial sport for the 2001 season. During 
this period, the program had tremen-
dous success under head coach Denny 
Harper, winning five USA Water Polo 
championships. This year is the 20th 
anniversary of the 1991 title, which 
was the second of three straight for the 
program. 

Despite the success, women’s water 
polo at the time was just developing 
as a sport which presented interesting 
challenges for the team. Only six of 

the team members had ever played 
water polo before coming to UCSD, 
and those six had never played on 
a women’s team. Co-Captain Christy 
Parker, for example, came to be on the 
swim team but ended up a four-time 
All-American in water polo.

“There wasn’t even girls high 
school water polo yet, so we all played 
on boys teams,” co-captain Kristen 
Larson (now Kristen Ruby) said.  “It 
was not easy. So when we showed up to 
college and it was okay to go to class in 
your sweats and with wet hair and no 
one looked at you funny for being an 
athlete, that was really huge.”

But being on the team meant a lot 
of sacrifice, with the athletic depart-
ment’s budget much smaller than it is 
today. Long car trips — often in the 

team member’s own vehicles — were 
the norm, and there usually wasn’t 
enough money for comfortable travel 
conditions.

 “We used to have five or six girls 
to a hotel room to save money,” Larson 
said. “But I think that’s why we’re all 
still so close. We spent a lot of time 
together, and not always in the best of 
circumstances.”

In the final, the Tritons overcame 
an early two-goal deficit to beat UC 
Davis 6-5. Brenda Reiton and Jamie 
Dailey joined Parker and Larson on 
the All-American team, as UCSD 
beat the Aggies in the final for the 
second straight year. 1991’s final was 
held at UCSD rather than at Brown 
University, as in the previous year. 

“To have it in San Diego, with 

everybody having all their families 
there — which was probably half of 
the people packing into Canyonview 
Pool — it was like a Hollywood end-
ing,” Larson said. “It couldn’t have been 
any more perfect.”

2000 Men’s Water Polo

When UCSD jumped from 
Division III to Division II for the 2000 
season, one team that didn’t have to 
worry about stiffer competition was 
men’s water polo. This was because 
they already played against the nation’s 
best teams. Competing at the same 
level as these teams, however, was 
another matter.

“It’s very clear who the normal 
winners are,” captain Justin Wylie said. 

“They have the history; they have the 
scholarships; they have the name. It 
never really came down to talent in 
our close losses against teams like Cal 
or USC. It came down to the fact that 
in the fourth quarter, we weren’t sure 
of ourselves. There was an intimida-
tion factor.”

Early in the year, however, the 
Tritons pulled off an upset against then 
top-ranked Cal, a stunning victory that 
would set the tone for the season. 
UCSD advanced to the final four of 
the NCAA tournament, entering with 
a stellar 20-8 record, but was forced to 
play against title-favorites in USC. 

The game was tight throughout, 
and the Tritons held a slim 9-8 lead late 

What makes an NFL football team great? What makes one mass of bodies on 
the field superior over another? This 
is the multi-billion-dollar question 
every owner, coach and fan wants 
answered, the holy grail of footballers 
everywhere. 

With this knowledge, the 49ers 
could rise from the ashes and Denver 
could hold its head high once more. 
The San Diego Chargers wouldn’t be 
going on television making excuses 
for their team, saying, “It’s something 
to build on,” as Chargers safety Eric 
Weddle did last weekend.

By now football fans are think-
ing about all the variables that could 
go into making a great team, and 
how you get to stand on top of the 
heap of broken opponents and say, 
“I am the very best.” You could be 
thinking that the key element is a 
great quarterback, a decisive run-
ning back that makes the hard yards, 
or a linebacker that makes all the 
right stops and really punishes the 
opponent. Or you could be thinking 
more broadly about a great defense 
working together, or an offense that 
is completely in sync.

But you would be wrong. 
In the NFL, almost every athlete is 

a freak. They are bigger, stronger and 
faster than any average person you 
may hope to meet. They know their 
game, have lived and breathed it for 
years; each one is the utmost tenth 
of one percent, the extreme elite. 
Certainly there are differences that 
make some better and some average, 
but a team of average players beats 
the team with a single star because 
they are all within a standard devia-
tion of ridiculous, out-of-this-world 
athletically skilled and gifted. 

Mistakes are what set a great team 
apart from a good team, at any level 
of sport. In the NFL, mistakes are 
few and far between. As an offense or 
defense, the main objective is to force 
the other team to make mistakes and 
limit your own. If you can capitalize 
on the other team’s mistakes and also 
limit your own mistakes, or limit how 
much the other team benefits from 
your mistakes, you will be great.

Mistakes are the reason the 
Chargers lead the NFL in total offense 
and total defense, but their record 
sucks compared to other teams with

MEN’S WATER POLO

The men’s water polo team earned an 11-6 win over WWPA opponent Claremont-Mudd-Scripps on Tuesday, getting the victory despite the visiting squad’s 
comeback attempt. The win moved the No. 12 Tritons to 11-10 
this season.

Senior Ryan Allred, junior Graham Saber and senior Bryce 
Madsen scored two goals apiece, and the Tritons led the entire 
game, all the way to the win. 

The Tritons jumped out to a quick lead with a goal by fresh-
man utility Dane Sequiera in the first 20 seconds of play, fol-
lowed by two more goals from Madsen and Allred to make the 
score 3-0 with nearly six minutes still to play in the first period. 
CMS found the net, but was swiftly answered by goals from 
Allred and Saber and the scoreboard read 5-1 for the start of 
the second quarter.

The Tritons slowed down their scoring pace in the second 
quarter, as the Stags opened the quarter with two quick goals.

“They [UCSD] lost interest and I think they got mentally 
tweaked,” head coach Denny Harper said.

With 4:30 left on the clock, Allred made a good steal and 
gained possession for the Tritons. The team passed the ball 
down the pool and thanks to an assist from Sequeira, Madsen 
brought the lead back to 6-3 for the Tritons. However, the 
Tritons’ play grew sloppy after the strong start.

“[The game was] definitely lackadaisical,” sophomore utility 
Brian Donohoe said. “We came out strong and went up pretty 
easily and then I think we just got lazy and started playing down 

at the level of our competition. I hate to say it like that, but that’s 
really what happened.”

The second half saw a rally with no successes on either side 
until Donohoe sunk a long shot into the corner of the goal. 
CMS rallied, however, and scored three straight to cut the 
Triton lead to 8-6 going into the final period.

“[The team] got into kind of an odd funk, and I don’t really 
think that there was really ever any feeling like we might lose,” 
Harper said. “But it’s that time of year when they need to feel 
good about how they are playing.” 

Despite their temperamental play, the Tritons secured the 
win in the fourth quarter by scoring three goals, and junior 
goalie David Morton shut out the Stags for the remainder of 
the game.

“I think this was a wake-up call,” Donohoe said. “We 
definitely didn’t play as well as we needed to. Tomorrow will 
be a good day of practice and also Thursday going into Friday’s 
game. UCI’s going to be a lot better than this team was. If we 
play like that, we’re going to get blown out, so we definitely need 
to ratchet things up and play a lot better than we did today.”

The Tritons look forward to two more season matches 
before the WWPA Championships against No. 5 UC Irvine this 
Friday at 6 p.m. and No. 19 Pomona-Pitzer Sunday at 12 p.m. 
Both games will be held at home at Canyonview Pool.
