A.S. Allocates Money 
to Price Center Party 
By LAURA PROCTOR 
Staff Writer 

The AS Council last week 
approved the funding of an all-
campu Charity Ball to be held 
April 22 at the new Price Center. 

In a separate action, the coun-
cil allocated funds to allow UCSD 
student to take part in an upcom-
ing San Diego parade honoring 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 

Jonathan Judaken noted that not 
all students belong to Greek 
organizations or attend colleges 
that sponsor emi-formal dances. 
He said that the ball will provide a 
"great opportunity" for tudents 
who previously have been unable 
to attend semi-formals to do so. 

"Not every college ha the abil-
ity to [put on] an event like this," 
DeFazio aid , st ressing that the 
ball would be an ali-campus event 
which would "benefit the student 
for a change." 

The ball: to include hors d' 
oeuvres, champagne, and live 
band , will cost $25 per couple 
and $15 per single for students, 
and $40 and $25, respectively, for 
non-students. The theme will be 
the Roaring Twenties.

FI~ .• n~I.1 Aid Line - Good things come to those who wait, or so these students hope while 
waiting In the one-hour check disbursement line at the Muir College Financial Aid Office. 

A sum of $8,000 was set aside 
for the Charity Ball, which in-
c1ude"s an underwrite of $3,900 (to 
be paid back to the A.S. general 
unallocated fund) and a flat allo-
cation of $4,200. Academic Affairs 
Commissioner Michelle DeFazio, 
who submitted the request for 
funding, described the ball a a 
"gala event," to include students, 
faculty, and members of the 
community. 

The Council also allocated $500 
for UCSD's participation in the 
San Diego Martin Luther King, 
Jr. Parade. 

UCSD Student Profile 
All profits will go towards stu-

dent cholar hips, although the 
methods of distribution have not 
yet been decided. 

Undergrad Enrollment Reaches Record; 
Applicants Had High GP As, SATs 

"We're not sure if we're going 
to [distribute the money] as small 
subsidies for a large amount of 
students or [as] a free ride for a 
few," DeFazio said. 

Muir Junior Senator John 
Ramirez, commenting on the 
event' title, said that billing the 
event as a "Charity Ball" might be 
mi leading if proceeds are used to 
benefit students instead of being 
donated to an outside charity. 

This parade will mark the first 
year that UCSD, as a whole, will 
take part in the parade. Partici-
pants will include representatives 
from all five colleges as well as 
any interested student organiza-
tions. 

UCSD plans to be represented 
in the parade by a float carrying 
graduating seniors to reflect the 
theme of "Education Through 
Diver ity." 

UCSD's undergraduate enrolJ-
ment last quarter reached an all-
time high of 14,105, an increa e of 
more than 500 students over the 
previous year's total, according to 
a student profile released last 
week. 

The profile was prepared jointly 
by the UCSD Office of Admis-
sion , the Registra'r, and Student 
Research and Information/ U nder-
graduate Affairs. It deals with 
enrollment information concern-
ing UC D undergraduates. 

The profile showed that more 
than 22,309 students sought 
undergraduate admission to 
UCSD for the 1988-89 school 
year. Of those, 11,825 were 
admitted and 3,511 actually 
enrolled as new tudents in the 
fall. 

Tho e who were admitted to 
UC D tended to have very high 
grade-point average. 

According to the study, nearly 
66 percent had high school G PA 's 
of 3.6 or better, and 32 percent 
had GPA's of 3.9 or higher. 

The Schola tic Aptitude Test 
cores of the applicant were the 

highest of U D applicant ince 
1979. The average SAT verbal 
core wa 525 and the average 

math score was 603 .

AMES Professor, Researcher 
Dies After 20 Years at UCSD 
By DEBORAH McCREA 
Contributing Writer 

Robert E. Rober on, UCSD profe sor and 
renowned researcher with over 113 pu bli hed 
works, pa ed away during the recent winter 
vacation at. the age of 65. 

As of pres time the Guardian was unable to 
confirm the exact cause of Roberson's death . 

Despite deteriorating health, he remained 
active last quarter, teaching AMES 10, an intro-
dt!ctory computer programming class. . 

Rober on had a distinguished career, receiving 
world-wide recognition. 

In 1968. he was per uaded to leave LA and 
join the fledgling engineering faculty in the 
Department of Applied Mechanic and Engi-
neering (AME ) here where he became the 
chairman of the department for five con ecuti e 
year. 

Known a the "G randfather of Guidance and 
ontrolof pace atellite." Rober on' re earch 

included multi-bod d ynamic and took him to 
Pari in 1967, Moscow in 19 4. and to Germanv a 
number of time in the pa t 15 ears. . 

In erman he re earched a nd developed 
app\i at ion for high- peed wheel-rail ehi Ie , 

uch as magnetic trains. 
In 1973, he received the prestigious Alexander 

von Humbolt Award admini tered by the Ger-
man government. 

For hi recent 65th birthday, colleagues from 
countries all around the globe, including Ger-
many, the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Belgium and 
the United States pre ented testimonials in the 
form of a book in honor of his important 
contributions. 

UCSD AME Professor Stanford Penner 
pointed out that during the 1987-88 school year, 
"Professor Roberson had taught over 800 tu-
dents, which is three times the number of tudents 
taught by any other professor in AME ." 

"My favorite thing about [Rober on] i that in 
addition to being a terrific re earcher, he really 
cared about undergraduate tudent," aid Pro-

NCAA Report Shows Sports 
Do Take Away From Study Time 

BERKELEY - A report released recently by the 
CAA shows that football and basketball players 

nationwide are spenaing more time playi ng their sport 
than they are studying or in the classroom. UC 
Berkeley was one of the 42 Division I institutions 
sampled. 

Football and basketball players spend an average 
of 30 hours per week during the sea on on the field or 
court , while spending 13. 7 hour a week in the 
classroom, according to the study. 

Students in other sports spend 24.6 hours playing 
and 14 hours in the classroom per week, while 
students involved in extracurricular activities spent 20 
and 15 hours in each respective area. 

The study also showed that the average grade point 
average for football and basketball players wa 2.46, 
for other athletes it was 2.61, and for extracurricularly 
involved students, 2.79.

Gender, Race Bias Plagues UC's 
Ag and Natural Resources Program 

BERKELEY - A lack of leadership, commitment 
and understanding has resulted in a ~deplorable" 
affirmative action record in the University of 
California's division of agricultural and natural 
resources, according to a recent report from a task 
force appointed to investigate the problem. 

The 80-page report , released this month, charges 
that minorities and women are underrepresented 
among the division's managers, faculty and 
cooperative extension specialists. 

BLOOM COUNTY 

In addition, the one program in the divi ion that is 
primarily staffed by minorities a nd women has been 
su bject to frequent layoffs. 

The di ision also appear to view grievances 
alleging sexual or racial discrimination as "hostile acts 
to be repelled, rather than as signals that employees 
are experiencine problems which ought to be 
investigated and addressed," the report states. 

In the next four months, the division will complete 
a plan to implement orne of the task force's 
recommendations, including telling managers in the 
divi ion that they will be held accountable for their 
department's affirmative actions efforts .

"Hewas very slow," said former

the fall of 1987. "When he'd write 
on the board he was slow. When 
he'd speak he was slow. you could

Former student David Marks

Marks was quick to add that 

Roberson did seem competent. 
"I could tell from the way he 

talked that he knew his stuff ... he 
was adequate and competent. He 
was a satisfactory professor." 

Roberson's extensive education

SETH SLATER, NewsEditor 

The Guardilm IS published Nice weeki) al che UnlvcrslI) ofCallfornl3. 
an Diego. Contrnts 0 1989, Views ex ressed herein are n01 necessarily 

those of the UC Board of Regent •. the AS UCSD or the Gllard,an. 

The Legal Noose 
If there i one thing that the University excel at, it 

has to be its miraculous ability to protect itself. 
It seem that whenever the University is in legal or 

financial jeopard y (no matter how small), its well paid 
and highly efficient band of lawyers and bureaucrats 
scramble to formulate a barrage of restrictive policy 
changes. 

Unfortunately, tudents - who play the part of 
plankton in the academic food chain - bear the 
brunt of these "new and improved" policy revisions. 

University lawyers and bureaucrats saw fit this 
su mmer to forbid ca mpus police and parking officials 
from pro iding a much needed ervice aiding stu-
dents and staff who have locked their keys in their 
cars. 

According to UC D Police Chief John Ander on, 
the Univer ity had to settle out of court with several 
people who complained that the police had damaged 
their vehicles while attempting to open their locked 
car doors. Some of the settlements in the past two 
years have cost the University up to $800 a piece. 

As a result, the campus business office forbade 
police and parking officials from performing any 
"non-police functions." In other word, the directive 
said not to nelp anyone who has locked themselves 
out of their car. Let them call the mechanic. 

Anderson said that the department tried requiring 
that locked out drivers sign a waiver before police 
would take action , but that plan had failed. Appar-
ently waivers aren't worth the paper they're printed 
on. According to UCSD Counseling Attorney Carrie 
Willson, no waiver can prohibit an individual from 
s uing another in case~ of recklessness or gross 
negligence. 

Campus police u ed 10 ju mp-start vehicles. This 
service has also been forbidden. Three yea rs ago a 
student was sprayed in the face with chemicals when a 
battery that an officer was trying to jump-start 
exploded. The student was not se riously hurt , how-
ever University officials called a halt to the service. 

Now, police can only perform "non-police func-
tions" when publ ic safety is threatened. The U niver-
sity has made it clear that mechanical services should 
be provided by professional mechanics, not the 
police. 

So why hasn't the University hired a mechanic! 
locksmith to accomodate the needs of its faculty, 
staff and students? It probably boils down to the two 
things the University cares about most - liability and 
expense. 

Simple, decent services like unlocking locked vehi-
cles and jump-starting batteries no longer have a 
place at UCS D. Once again, the University has suc-
ceeded in protecting itself. And once again, it has 
done so at our expense.

Campus Minds 
Stagnate 
Editor: 

With the recent media attention 
that uch topic as sexism and racism 
have been receiving, it i important to 
understand where the seeds of this 
behavior are rooted. 

Sexism and racism are myths, per-
petuated by co n tant reinforcement 
of stereotypic characterizations of 
entire groups of people. U ndou bted!y, 
the media (entertainment, news, and ' 
especially advertising) abuse and 
manipulate these stereotypes to push 
their message to the masses , but they 
continue this practice because it really 
works. People are willing to buy it. 

Even on college campuses, there 
exist large populations of "myth-fed" 
people, who are either too frightened 
or impressionable ' to formulate 
opinions upon an individual basis. 
The most disturbing aspect of this 
"social condition" however, lies in the 
fact that they till have an arena to 
share and reinforce their sexist and 
raci t conceptions. Groups of people, 
within the framework of general social 
interaction, continue to perpetuate 
the myth. 

In October, a flyer was distributed 
around cam pu s, announcing a 
Halloween party. This flyer was meant 
to advertise the party and entice 
interested party-goers to attend. A 
large sketch of a "busty-woman-

halloween-sex-witch" covered the 
entire top right half of the page, and 
below her read, "There will be plenty 
of BEVERages." This was doing 
more, obviously, than advertising 
beer. 

Women were included in this invita-
tion with the sole purpo e of being 
entertainment objects for men. (And 
they wonder why the "ratio" is always 
so bad .) Not only does the depiction 
of women on this flyer serve to 
broaden the gender gap, it treats 
women as the "lesser sex," placing 
them. in a subordinate position. 

This type of attitude is unhealthy 
all around: Men continue to mis-
understand women, to perceive them 
in an easy, pre-fabricated , "dizzy sub-
human sex / nurture" way, and it is 
thus that they approach them. This, 
then triggers the easily-swayed female 
to believe that she has to reinforce 
men's (generally erroneous) concep-
tion of her, and behave a certain way 
just to be "accepted". 

So, together we get a group of 
people who, out of fear or just plain 
ignorance, are playing so masterfully 
at being what they think they should 
be. that they grad ually start to .lose 
sight of who they really are. 

Here lies the danger of the myth. 
How easily a belief like sexism or 
racism becomes a way of life, rearing 
its ugly head in even the smallest and 
most intimate of human interactions. 
Changing the belief, however, starts 
with the individual. 

It takes a firm decision to dispel the 
convenient shell that myth provides. 
It takes awareness, and the comjJ1it-
ment to expose the myth, when it 

appears among peer groups, on party 
fl yers, or in the "world at large." 

Ultimately, it takes the will to free 
ourselves from a tagnating state of 
mind . Remember that when anyone

Twists Facts 
Editor: 

In a letter titled "A.S. Won't 
Confront Student Rights Issues" 
Maynard Dimmesdale wantonly took 
my words out of context . 

The letter began with the assertion 
that "The A.S. Council has joined the 
administration in reducing the rights 
of students." After that , Dimmesdale 
gave information describing the 
decline of student representation, and 
proceeded to note that the resolution 
titled "Student Input in Campus 
Policies" was not passed by the 
Associated Students. I am quoted as 
saying that passage of the resolution 
would be "an embarrassment to the 
A.S. Council." 

Taken in conjunction with the first 
sentence of the letter, and the title of 
the resolution , it is clear that 
Dimmesdale implied that my state-
ment, and the actions of the A.S. 
were in reference to more student 
representation. Nothing could be 
farther from the truth. 

In presenting the resolution, Bard 
Alan Finlan, who was the author, 
made it clear that the decline in 
student representation from 5 to 2

was the fault of an earlier A.S. 
Council. According to Bard , the 
tudent representatives to the 

committee were so derelict in their 
attendance that their numbers 
were reduced to allow the other 
members to complete their work 
on schedule. 

In light of this fact. the retroac-
tive aspect ofthe legislation (which 
would have voided all the com-
mittee's work) hardly eemed fair. 
so I expressed disapproval for 
those lines concerned specifically 
with this . I prefaced this point 
with my unequivocal support of 
more student representation and 
empha ized that I agreed with the 
intent of the legislation (more 
student representation) while dis-
agreeing with its terms. 

In this context. I concluded by 
saying t hat passage of such a retro-
active re olution, since the decline 
lay at the hands of the students, 
would be "an embarras ment to 
the A.S. Council." 

1 abstained from voting on this 
issue because I was so strongly in 
favor of more student representa-
tion and a "no" vote would have 
failed to convey this. Quite a 
number of council members [ab-
stained] in kind. and I would 
assume they did so for similar 
reasons. 

Dimmesdale's simplistic analy-
sis erroneously leads him to 
assume that simply becau e I (and 
the AS.) refuse to endorse a par-
ticular piece of legislation, I dis-
agree with its purpose. I know for 
a fact that the AS. supported 
increased student representation, 
since after the night in question, 
Bard Alan Finlan made some 

changes, and the A.. ouncil 
unanimou Iy approved his re olu-
tion. 

I wrote this letter, not to create 
st rife within the council , (I am no 
longer on ouncil) but because 
after Dimmesdale ' landerous 
letter I felt I had to set the record 
tra ight in the intere t of truth . I 

have put too much time and effort 
into my A . Dutie to allow my 
words to be taken out of co ntext 
for the mi guided purposes of a 
manipUlative politician . 

1 thoroughly disapprove of the 
way Maynard has been using the 
Guardian as the means of fighting 
his battles with the Associated 
Students. He would probably 
respond that letters to the editor 
are his way of communicating 
with the st udents, but he is not 
serving anyone except himself 
when he twists facts and indulges 
in misrepresentations to the 
UCSD community. 

I must ask the Guardian, why 
do you keep printing his letters? It 
is not sufficient to reply that he i 
president , because time and time 
again Maynard ha misrepre-
sented or absolutely twisted facts 
through the Guardian . If the 
Guardian insists on printing his 
letters they ought to print (simul-
taneously) an opposing point of 
view, or they ought to attempt to 
check his assertions for accuracy. 
I should not have to spend even 
one second defending myselffrom 
unfounded altacks such as this. 

I hope I am the last person who 
has to defend herself from the 
Enquirer-type allegations which 
Maynard makes, and the Guar-
dian perpetrates. whether inten-
tionally or not.

Computer Model 

Los Alamos Scientists Study 
, . Hazardous Waste Migration 

By RISA GECHTMAN 
Contriburing Wrirer 

A team of scientists at the Los 
Alamos National Laboratory, 
operated by the University of 
California, is now developing a 
co mputer model to simulate and 
predict the migration of hazard-
ous waste through soil. 

The model focuses on the 
movement of organic hazardous 
wastes (carbon-based solvents and 
fuels) and helps scientists predict 
how far a nd fast such waste 
travels. 

"The model does not always 
give absolute answers, but it's a 
very good tool to evaluate migra-
tion systems," said hydrologist 
Everett Springer from Los Ala-
mos' Environmental Science 
Group. 

The model is particularly suited 
for making predictions about the 
behavior of waste buried in large 
areas that would otherwise be 
extremely difficult, costly and 
time-consuming to examine. 

Scientists hope that the compu-
ter model will generate informa-

from the model to determine 
priority environmental need s," 
said hazardous waste expert 
Christina Graulau of the San 
Diego Health Deparment. 

Many of the model's predic-
tions are based on the fact that 
most common hazardous wastes, 
including fuels such as gasoline, 
vaporize in the soil. 
. "Most of these wastes are dis-
posed of in liquid form, but 
because of their high volatility 
and the dry nature of soil, they 
will rapidly turn into vapor," 
Springer said. 

Vapor can diffuse 100,000 times 
faster than liquid. This allows for 
the possibility that earlier compu-
ter models using water movement 
as a basis for waste migration 
predictions may have overlooked 
a potentialJy important contam-
ininant pathway. 

Springer and chemical engineer 
Chester Porzucek have been 
working on their model for about 
18 months. 

The scientists enter into the 
computer such information as soil 
conditions, amount and location 

of the hazardous waste , and when 
it was deposited at the site. The 
model then uses up to 80,000 dif-
ferent reference points to calcu-
late the prediction. 

The computer predictions will 
be cross-checked with actual 
chemical migration patterns being 
researched in a laboratory setting. 

Springer and Porzucek will 
soon begin working with the Air 
Force to predict the potential 
migration of solvents and fuels, 
such as J P-4 jet fuel , from storage 
sites. 

"We have only begun to simu-
late the processes that occur when 
these organic substances migrate 
through the soil," Springer said . 
"There are many chemical and 
biological processes that affect 
these compounds, and these are 
poorly understood." 

To get the model into the hands 
of more users, the researchers 
realize it cannot be tied to large 
computers, and have determined 
that "one of our goals is to move 
the model to a smaller computer 
so it can be more easily used by 
others," according to Springer.

Los Alamos Invention to Aid Superconductor Research 
By DAVID POTICHA 
Contribwing Wrizer 

A neutron "powder diffract-
ometer," developed at the Lo 
Alamos National Laboratory, 
operated by the University of 
California, will u e neutrons to 
precisely analyze the structure of 
high temperature superconductors 
and other materials. 

Project scientist Joyce Gold-
stone called the truck-sized device 
"one piece of the puzzle to under-
stand material behavior." 

Goldstone and other research-
ers plan to use the device to 
improve their under tanding of 
the atomic structure of various 
materials. That understanding, 
according to information distrib-
uted by Los Alamos, is crucial for

broader scientific knowledge 
about the electrical and thermal 
properties of materials. 

The device allows scientists to 
con truct detailed models of 
materials they wish to engineer or 
of materials they want to better 
understand. Researcher can then 
check exi ting data against the 
diffraction patterns generated by 
the device.

Continued from pile 8 
sophisticated version ofthe device. 

The intrumenl uses small 
amounts of powder or solid 
fingertip-size samples for analy-
sis. The analytical technique is 
based on how neutr6ns (tiny 
atomic particles) diffract, or bend, 
after bouncing off the material -
hence, the name "powder dif-
fractometer. " 
. When a material is diffracted, a 
beam is shone through the crys-
tals that comprise the malerial 
and a set oflines is created. These 
lines are then read by detectors 
which send the reflections from 
the crystals, created when neu-
Irons penetrate them, to a compu-
ter for analYSIS. 

Each material, according to 
UCSD physicist Frances Hellman, 
provides a "unique set of lines" 
with which scientists can work. 

Hellman explained why powder 

am pies, composed of thousands 
of crushed crystals, are desirable 
to work with. 

II • •• the pictures 
we are getting are 
10 times better than 
what we e·ver had 
before. " 

-Robert Von Dreele 
Los Ala mos physicist 

When diffraction is done with 
one crystal, the set of lines pro-
duced depends "on the angle that 
the beam hits the crystal," HeI-
lman said. "There are numerous. 

NEWS 
,. ways to pOSition the crystal. By 
using a powder, you can get all of 
those different angles tested in 
one sample. 

Los Alamos physicisl Robert 
Von Dreele further explained that 
some crystals "break down and 
fall apart with change oftempera-
ture, whereas powders do~'t." 

Goldstone said that most dif-
fracto meters use X-rays instead 
of neutrons, but explained that 
neutrons have greater penetrating 
power and will offer a chance to 
look deeply into a material's 
structure. 

Hellman, while agreeing that 
neutrons may create better patt-
erns, said she doesn't believe the 
new instrument will ever replace 
X-ray diffractometers. 

X-rays are "Cheaper, easier to 
use, routine, and everyone has 
them," Hellman said . 

To perform neutron diffraction 
she continued, a "powerful neu-

tron producer - and accelerator 
- is needed . These sources are 

rare and expensive and are only 
found at large labs such as the one 
at Los Alamos." 

Molly Alexander/ Guardian 
Physicist Francis Hellman 

Monday, January 9, 1989 9 

Despite these shortcomings, 
Los Alamos scientists seem 
pleased with the instrument's 
performance. 

The diffractometer's recent first 
test rur. was labeled a "perfect 
success" by Von Dreele who said 
the instrument "ran some stand-
ard calibration materials and then 
some experimental samples . . . The 
device ran exactly as we antici-
pated. 

"If you want to place a number 
on this device as far as improve-
ment [over earlier ones], the pic-
tures we are getting are 10 times 
better than what we ever had _ 
before. 

"Of course," Von Dreele con· 
tinued, "it won't be complete for a 
few more years. We're still four 
detectors short and detectors cost 
a lot of money." 

Goldstone says plans call for 
the addition of four more detec-
tors over the next two years to 
map material structures in even 
greater detail

Reagan Names New Regents 
The Regents are meeting 

once again today on the Berke-
ley campus. However, since 
the November meeting at 
UCSD, several changes have 
taken place in the membership 
that have enabled the Reagan 
forces to furt her consolidate 
their influence on the board. 

Of five new members, th ree 
were appointed by Reagan to 
fill unexpired terms of members 
who resigned. The other two 
are ex-officio members, one of 
whom assumes his position by 
virtue of a Reagan appoint-
ment. 

Similarly, Robert Finch, 
designated by President-elect 
Nixon as Secretary of Hous-
ing, Education, and Welfare in 
the new administration, will be 
replaced by Ed Reinecke, 
whom Reagan appointed to 
the position of Lieutenant-
Governor in Finch's place. 

Monagan is considered to 
be a moderate RepUblican. and 
has in the past displayed some 
degree of independence from 
the governor. However, both 
Monagan and Reinecke, who 
has more right-wing leanings, 
are expected to be safely in the 
Reagan camp. 

Robert Reynolds, president 
of the California Angels base-
baH club will replace Samuel 
Mosher, who has not attended 
a meeting in two years because 
of illness. Reynolds, also a 
vice-president of the Los 
Angeles Rams, is a 1936 grad-
uate of Stanford. He was pres-
ident of Golden West Broad-
casters, a firm operating a 
group of radio stations, for 16 

years until he sold his interest 
last August. 

At this meeting the contro-
versial matter of guest lectur-
ers will not come up, since 
action concerning this has been 
tabled until the March meet-
ing. However, in light of recent 
hard line statements made by 
Governor Reagan in the press, 
it is highly possible that there 
will be an attempt to introduce 
stringent measures aimed at 
student and faculty protestors. 

Also, the question of rehir-
ing of Professor Marcuse of 
UCS D may also come before 
the Board when they meet in 
open session this afternoon. 

Robert Managan, who re-
placed Democrat Jesse Unruh 
as Speaker of the Assembly 
after the Republicans gained a 
majority in the legislature in 
the recent elections automati-
cally takes over Unruh's posi-
tion as an ex-officio member 
of the board. 

Furthermore, three regents 
have resigned since the last 
meeting and have been replaced 
by Governor Reagan. H.R. 
Haldeman resigned to join 
Nixon's White House staff,and 
will be replaced by Dean A. 
Watkins, 46, a Palo Alto 
businessman. 

Watkins, an electrical engi-
neer, holds a doctorate from 
Stanford University, where he 
was a professor until 1964 when 
he co-founded an electronics 
manufacturing firm. He is cur-
rently president and chief 
officer of the company as well 
as being a trustee of Stanford 
University. 

Regents' Meeting Marked By 
Protest and Confrontation 

The drama at last Friday 's open 
sessio n of the Board of Regents 
did not take place inside the small 
and crowded conference room of 
University Ha ll, acros the st reet 
from the Berkeley campus. As the 
Rege nts held a short and rather 
uneventful meeting inside, a group 
of picketers, the estimates of 
whose size ranged between 400 
and 1000, protested Regents' 
policies and demonstrated their 
solidarity with the San Francisco 
State strike. 

Finally, when Governor 
Re<lganemerged from the building 
to leave in his awaiting limousine: 
he was greeted by a chorus of 
derisive chants and several eggs, 
which hit his limousine. Smiling 
to the crowd, true to style, Reagan 
entered the limousine and made a 
hasty retreat. The surging crowd 
nearly surrounded the car when it 
became entangled in a traffic jam. 
. In an earlier incident several 
Nindows in the lobby of University 
Hall were shattered when a 
thirteen-year-old boy was taken 

into custody. Police claimed that 
the boy had pelted them with 
spitwads. As the boy was being 
arrested and dragged away, the 

. Governor Reagan 
was greeted by a 
chorus of derisive 
chants and several 
eggs, which hit his 
limousine. 

demonstrators surged forward 
and shattered the large plate glass 
windows. 

Outside of these two incidents 
the students maintained a steady 
but restrained picket line through-
out the afternoon, completely 
encircling the building. 

The picketing had been called 
for by an alliance of seven campus 

groups, including the American 
Federation of Teachers local 1570, 
the Center for Participant 
Ed ucat ion, and the Radical 
Student Union. 

Of immediate concern to the 
demonstrators was the secl uded 
nature of Regents' meetings at 
University Hall. The conference 
room there is extremely limited in 
seating capacity, providing room 
for only some 20 public observers 
after the press and UC officials 
have been taken care of. 

Several student groups had 
charged the Regents with a viola-
tion of the Brown Act of 1967, 
which specifies that meetings of 
public governing bodies shall be 
open to the pUblic. The situation 
has been intensified by the . 
Regents' decision to break their 
tradition of rotating meetings 
among the various UC campuses 
in an annual cycle. 

Next month's meeting, original-
ly scheduled for Riverside, will be 
held at Berkeley, as will all 
meetings until further notice. 

'Hair' 
-

Have You Ever Felt Alive catalogue. There is the black soldier, dressed in battle fatigues 
with helmet and rifle, standing 
over a floor light at parade rest. 
The effect is chilling. Or there is 
the light show, which uses flash-
lights and reflecting dresse to 
create a universe of multicolored, 
constantly vibrating pinpoints of 
1ight. 

As you stagger out of the 
Aquarius Theatre in Hollywood, 
you know that you have seen it. 
You were afraid that it was, well , 
going to end, and it really did. 

You try to talk about what you 
have seen and all that comes out 
of your mouth is a stream of 
inadequate adjectives. And, until 
you have thought about it for a 
little while, that is about all you 
can say. 

After having thought about it 
for quite a while, let me tart off 
by saying that Hair is a two act 
musical, written by our generation 
and produced because it had to 
be. It throws more of our society 
at you in a three hour period than 
anything yet created, and it makes 
you laugh harder than a Ronald 
Reagan press conference. It is 
outrageous and outraged, cream-
ing a t us to wake up, to be alive, to 
dance and sing and care. 

Hair i conventional theatre 
only so far as the audience has to 
pay for tickets and that they have 

to sit in seats. Aside from that , 
Hair makes use of no curtains and 
has a set that never looks the same 
way twice. This result is achieved 
by the use oflights, bodies, drapes. 
trapdoors. and lighted boxes, the 
effect of which is to keep the eyes 
moving constantly. 

A further innovation is the pre-
sence of the musicians on stage. 
The music consciousness of our 
time has finally led to the recogni-
tion that the term "performers" 
means more than actors on the 
stage, and thus we find that the 
guitars, drums, and flutes are per-
forming on stage where they 
should be. 

As previously mentioned the 
pla~ is a ml:lsi cal, but it is what 
could be called the first of the 
non-stop musicals. For although 
there is dialogue between the play-
ers, the dialogue is difficult to 
hear and it is only a thin filiment 
connecting the songs and the 
dances. The songs and dances are 
performed by about thirty people, 
but often times it seems like 100 
bodies are twisting and loving 
and si nging on stage. 

Superficially the play concern 
a guy (maybe you?) who is strug-
gling with the draft and Medicare 
Hershey, but actually thi tory 
flutters in and out of the play at 

irregular interva ls. What is hap-
pening on stage is usually a song 
or dance, and the music is every-
thing from acid to blues. 

Once again the eyes are bombar-
ded with an impossible number of 

Hair is conven-
tional theater only 
so far as the audi-
ence has to pay for 
tickets and that they 
have to sit in seats. 

images, and the ears are trying to 
soak up as much music and lyrics 
as possible. It is a frustratingly 
impossible effort. 

While the above is a good 
indication of what i generally 
happening on stage, the individual 
scenes are too numerous to 

Of all the feats of Hair, however, 
perhaps none is greater than that 
of unrestrained, bubbling laugh-
ter. You have never laughed until 
yo u have heard a black girl, 
dressed as Abraham Lincoln and 
taking part in a kit abou t the 
Civil War, yell at the sight of 
some African warriors: "Oh my 
god , ... nigger !!" 

Nor wi ll one soo n forget the 
sight of the "Supremes" and three 
white girl inging back and forth 
about how much the former likes 
white boys and how much the 
latter likes black boy . Add to this 
a pot party, jab at commercials 
and all that goes with them, gentle 
satire on the middle aged intel-
lect-gap, and a six foot ciga r store 
Indian giving the peace jgn, and

T here's a new fraternity on campus, but hold on to your beer steins men , and 
don 't worry about your intramu-
ral athletic record. This fraternity 
requires a resume and cover let-
ter, is open to both men and 
women (students, faculty, and 
staff) , and has not yet planned 
any social activities . 

Revelle senior Katherine Bar-
niseI is the first president and one 
of the "founding fathers" of Alpha 
Kappa Psi, a business fraternity , 
which is "colonizing" at UCSD 
winter and spring quarters. When 
Barnisel thought of starting up 
th e fraternity last year while 
abroad in France, she "didn't 
realize how much work it would 
be, II she said. 

The fraternity, the oldest and 
largest of its ki nd, according to 
Barnisel, is open to all students, 
even those who a lready belong to 
one of the social fraternities or 
sororities. It is exclusive, how-
ever, to those who, according to 
national Alpha Kappa Psi policy, 
"have the intention at some point 
[including graduate sc hool) of 
attaining a degree in Economics 
or QEDS," Barnisel said . 

Although students with a wide 
range of majo rs may be interested 
in some type of business career, 
Barnisel pointed out that this fra-
ternity was the only one she is 
aware of which accepts members 
not majoring in business. 

"I was a little disappointed with 

the Econ depa rtment," Barnisel 
said, from which she feels she has 
"not had a lot of su pport. " 
Although she has emphasized the

Associated Students Advisor 
Randy Woodard and Assistant 
Vice Chancellor Tom Tucker have 
committed to joining the frater-
nity. according to Barnisel , and 
she plans to contact Vice Chan-
cellor of Undergraduate Affairs 

Joe Watson. 

The fraternity plans to present 
itself professionally, holding inter-
views and requiring resumes of 
the rushees. They will collect

There is a grim reality of 
college life that you mayor may not 
be acquainted with. Typing. 

No, make that hours of 
typing. Precisely why you should 
consider a Macintosh™ computer. 

With programs like 
WriteNow and Microsoft Word, you 
can compose, edit, move paragraphs, 
and change type sizes and styles with 
one finger. Which can come in very 
handy. (Especially if that's the way 

you type.) And that's just one 
example of how Macintosh helps 
students work smarter, quicker and 
more creatively. 

The good news is, with 
Macintosh you don't have to know 
anything about computers to use one. 

The better news is, you don't 
have to know anything about white 
out, either. 

•• The power to be your best.

Libraries 
Keep Books 
Leashed 

By RANDY DOTINGA 
Slaff Writer 

Most tudents probably would 
assume that when they. check out 
a book from a UCSD library, 
they can keep it until the due date. 
There is a little-known policy, 
however, through which a library 
may "recall" (take back) a book 
from a borrower if it is needed by 
someone else. 

According to Assistant Head 
of Access Services Nancy Beale, 
"hundreds" of recalls are done 
each week. 

Beale said that recalls can be 
done in two instances. First, if 
another student, faculty or staff 
member wants a book someone 
else has borrowed , a recall notice 
will be sent to the original bor-
rower, giving him or her a revised 
due date. 

This kind of recall can only be 
done in the first 14 days of the 
griginal borrowing period. The 
library "will count to make sure 
that the original borrower had 
(the book) for 14 days" before the 
revised due date , Beale aid. 

If the book is not returned, "it 
is subject to a billing ... we give 
you a grace period then . .. we'll 
type up a bill for (replacement)" 
plus a $5 non-refundable billing 
fee, she said . 

The second way a book can be 
recalled is when it is needed for a 
professor's reserves. With this 
procedure a book can be recalled 
at any time, not just during the 
first 14 days of the borrowing 
period . If it is not returned by the 
revised due date, usually five days 
from the day the recall notice is 
sent out, the borrower will be 
fined replacement costs, the bil-
ling fee , and special overdue fines , 
Beale said . 

One student said that she re-
ceived a recall notice last quarter 
saying that she must return two 
books within a week or be fined 
for replacement . Because she 
desperately needed the books, she 
re orted to copying them before 
returning them. 

To avoid such a situation there 
is a waiver on the charge ca rd 
used to check out books which 
asks if the borrower wishes to 
make his or her name, address 
and phone number available to 
others who may wish to use the 
book being borrowed , Beale 
explained. 

See BOOKS, page 15

Continued from pale 11 
public), and sending members to 
regional and national conferen-
ces, Barnisel said . The fraternity 
plans to initiate 50 "founding 
fathers" at the end of January. 

The fraternity is not, however. 
completely devoid of ocial activ-
ity. Barnisel would like to plan a 
ski trip and ment ioned a regional 
softball game. San Diego State 
University and the University of 
San Diego both have chapters 
with which Barnisel hopes to plan 
events. 

At USC, Alpha Kappa P i is 
one of the mo t popular groups.

ties. he aid .

Library Recalls Books 
Continued from page 14 

She said that many students 
waive their confidentiality rights . 
This allow~ omeone else who 
wants to borrow the book for a 
brief time to first go directly to the 
borrower fort he book. "You'd be 
surprised how many people are 
willing to share a book," Beale 
s:>id. 

If confidentiality is not waived. 
others who want a borrower's 

book may have no choice except 
to recall it. 

I n order to inform more library 
patron about the recall policy, 
Beale said " We need new hand-
outs," and that "they are in the 
process of being written. " 

Beale noted that the reca ll pol-
icy "has been in effect as long as 
I've been here- for 13 years," and 
that it i a common procedure in 
most libraries.

Continued from pale 19 
the first few of the second half to 
widen their lead to 16 at the J 8:30 
mark. 

The T rito ns returned th eir 
opponents' one-s ided play with 
some of their own, reeling off II 
unanswered points in the three-
and-a-half minutes to close in at 
47-42. The up tempo sequence 
involved all five Tritons on the 
floor as Troy sank an eight-footer , 
Kramer banked two inside, Qui-
gley tipped in the miss on a fast-
break off a steal, Gerlach buried 
one from way outside, while Gor-
don McNeill grabbed several of 
his 10 boards. 

Marshall said, "There was no 
letdown, even though we trailed 
by 16. We saw them wilting and 
tried to take advantage, but Ram-
sey is a smart coach who called a 
timeout and got them together. " 

That five-point deficit proved 
to be as close as the Tritons would 
get , as they watched Horst single-
handedly negate their teamwork 
with a couple of bombs which 
gave Millikin back their large 
lead, 65-52. Kramer, McNeill, and 
Batt hung tough, even though 
nothing was falling for UCSD, 
and eventually the team pulled 
close at 69-63. 

With three minutes remaining, 
the Tritons displayed stingy 
defense as they forced a Millikin 
shot with 5 seconds on the clock, 
but they turned it over, giving 
Millikin an easy layup. A couple 
of similar sequences found the 
Tritons down by 10 and they had 
to foul in order to stop the clock. 

Their tactics seemed to work as 
their opponents missed from the 
line while Kramer hit a six-footer 

to fin is h with a hard-earned 20, 
and Greg Kund found a ll net for 
three of his ten. T he clock. how-
ever, halted the comeback and 
ended the scoring 75-70. 

"At the end we got greedy and 
rushed. We needed an extra bit of 
'oomph,' but we didn 't have it," 
Marshall conceded. "But like I 
told the kids in the locker room, 
it's better to lose by five to a ranked 
team than by two to an unranked 
team. " 

SPORTS 
The Tritons' next two games 

are against maller, quicker, run-
and-gun teams. They host La 
Verne Wednesday night, a nd 
Redlands on Saturday. Redlands 
is among the nat iona l leaders 
with an average of I J.4 three-
pointers made per game, and they 
display an up tempo attack. Mar-
shall predicted, '" think we'l do 
well , the up tempo is better in out 
favo r than i slow tempo, It will be 
exciting."

tuff and kills this eason. 

The setter position on the tea m 
has become very competitive this 
year. Junior Mike Badt, redshin 
fresh person John Childers, and 
junior John Lee are all battling 
for the starting spot. Because of 
an injury to Badt, Childers and 
Lee sp lit the action at setter on 
Saturday. Childers took advan-
tage of the si tuation and made 
some outstanding plays as the 
Tritons won all three games he 
participated in. It is obvious that 
the Triton offen e is right on par 
going into the season. 

However, it is team defense, 
particula rly blocking, that Gray-
bill feels is going to be most cru-
cial in determining the team's suc-
cess. The Tritons have greater 
than average height this year and 
have seen good play from 6'4" 
middle blocker John Fox. If the 
outside hitters on the team con-
sistently block well, this could be 
the best Triton team ever.

PHIL'S ANALYSIS . .. To be honest , I have no 
idea how good (or bad) Whittier is . But if there is one 
thing that I do know: they're going to lose. Why? It's 
perfectly clear. The Tritons, at 7-4, are off to one of 
their best starts ever three-point shooter extraordi-
naire Tracy Ragatz to last year's form when she led the 
nation in three-point field goal percentage. After suf-
fering a humiliating 31-point loss to Millikin in the 
UCSD Tournament, the Tritons rebounded last 
Monday to beat that same Millikin team by seven 
points. Since that time, UCSD has not played a single 
game, and will be well rested and ready to take on 
Whittier tomorrow night at 7 p .m. in the Triton Pavil-

Marshall emphasized that his

Can the travel aaent and 

book a fliaIlt, because five more 
UCSD wimmera have quali-
fied for the NCAA Division III 
Nationals. 

Over the weekend. Tritons 
Jenna Banuzek, Brian 1bo-
mas, Grea Goodrich, Dave 
Sacco and Cindy Miller all 
swam qualifyina times for the 
Nationals, to be held in Or-
lando, Aorida in mid-March. 

Their task was far from easy, 
due Lu stormy weather which 
threatened to cancel UCSO's 
Senior Invitational on Friday 
through Sunday. Luckily, the 
coaches chose to "swim through 
the ugly stuff" and the three 
day event continued as planned. 

Jenna Banaszek led things 
off for the Tritons, placing 
third in the SOO-meter freestyle 
final. Her time of5: 12.84 easily 
qualified her for Nationals. 
Having missed the last meet 
dut to pneumonia, Banuzek 
"was just trying to get the feel 
of the water again ... 

Minuteslater,"8rad Thomas, 
a distance swimmer for UCSD, 
touched in at a Nationals qual-
ifyina time of .:.3.53, aaain in 
the SOO-mcter freeatylc. -Before

about wu matina time. now 

I'm pretty relieved," he said.

Day two of tile meet offered 
no break in the weather. Swim-
mers struated to stay warm, 
and remain focused. 

Greg Goodrich, a newly 
arrived transfer student from 
Foothill Junior College, heat-
ed things up by reaching the 
wall first in the 1000meter 
backstroke final. In his second 
meet as a Triton, Goodrich 
grabbed himself a seat on the 
flight to Orlando with a time of 
54.10. 

After two days of swimming, 
Triton men remained in second 
place with 830 points, 60 points 
behind Bakersfield. The Triton 
women, meanwhile. extended 
their lead to 86 points over 
second place Cell Poly. ,

and added two more swimmm 
to tbe qualification ranks.

The championship game could 
not have differed more from the 
previous night. Both teams 
showed early peed and a desire 
to gun from three-point range, 
especially the Millikin Big Blue 
who e coach Joe Ram ey ex-
plained, "Three-point shooting is 
an integral part of what we try to 
do offensively." 

After the game, though, Mar-
shall still praised Troy, "You can't 
ask a point guard to do any better 
than that (eight points, five assi ts, 
five rebounds, and only two tur-
novers) unless he's an All-Amer-
ican. He gets overlooked becau, e 
he doesn't get the big numbers 
like Kramer and Gerlach, but he 
makes thing happen." 

Men's Volleyball Preview 

All-Tournament team member 
Gerlach opened the scoring with a 
shot just inside the three-point 
line. Fellow honoree Kramer al 0 
contributed immediately, burying 
three jumpers in the early minutes. 

UCSD coach Tom Marshall 
claimed that hi team came out 
flat, but it seemed to be control-
ling the game, scoring off steals 
and fast breaks. Millikin tayed 
within range because of the three-
point shooting di play from 
returning All-American and 
Tournament MVP Brian Hor 1. 
Hor t canned three in the first 
half, and ix of even overall to 
finish with a game-high 26. 

Neither team took charge as 
the lead shifted eight times to a 
19-19 tie at the II :05 mark. 

At the halfway point in the 
period , a que tionable foul led to 
a verbal altercation resulting in a 
double technical on both Troy 
and Hor t. Both teams sank the 
freebies and Triton Scoop Troy, ' 
the team-leader in assists, and 
whom Mar hall call the "cata-
Iyst," at out the rest of the half. 

The game remained close until 
the final moments, as Millikin

UCSD Could Have Best Season Ever 
By JONCARLO MARK 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's volleyball 
team leaped into its ea on Sat-
urday afternoon with a 3-2 vic-
tory in the annual Alumni Game. 
The match provided Head Coach 
o car "Digger" Graybill with his 
first look at the team which he 
believes has the potential to be the 
best ever at UCSD. According to 
GraybiIl, the Tritons unsurpris-
ingly performed "up and down," 
yet he was happy to ee them 
begin a sea on full of potential. 

UC D finished la t year ranked 
18th nationally in Divi ion I, and 
Graybill sees no reason why the 
team cannot repeat or improve on 
this excellent accomplishment for 
a Division III school. 

"The team is highly talented , 
but a a whole, is very young," 
tated Graybill after the game. 

There is only one enior on the 
squad, which includes nine fresh-
per ons and ophomore of the 15 
player . evertheless, it is obvious 
that the co nsistency of the young 
players is going to be a key factor 

to the success of the team. 
The Tritons are led by return-

ing sophomore outside hitter Nick 
Rothman. As a redshirt fresh per-
on last year, Nick achieved All-

Conference recognition. 
"At times, Nick's play is phen-

omenal," explained Graybill. " He 
has a competitive attitude which 
motivates the entire team in games 

and practices." 
Of the newcomers, fresh person 

Nate Brown has impressed Coach 
Graybill the most. The 6'1" out-
side hitter from Santa Cruz hits 
extremely hard and has good 
jumping abilities. 

Along with sophomore Kenn), 
Blackman and senior Jeff Bab-
