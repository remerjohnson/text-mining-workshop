obl igation for a student government to fund any de,!1ymg such allegat IOn .. 
campus media, and perhaps thi s is the true issue that fhe crescendo of hbe ra l 
the Review controversy has brought to light. Where 
does one draw the line? If you fu nd the left, it would 
seem equitable to equally fund the right, the middle of 
the road, and everybody else. We are entering a fiscal 
crisis , however, so the true question may be, "Why 
fund any of them?" 

A Guardian staffer who transferred here from 
Pittsburg was agog at the number of publications on 
campus. He was even more shocked when he learned 
that they were all funded by the AS. UCSD is, in 
fact, fairly unique in its wi ll ingness to devote "tudent 
monies to publications. 

Perhaps this money would be better spent on 
programs that directly assist students. Affirma tive 
Action, the Women's Center, the Coops, Soft 
Reserves and any number of student organizat ions 
may be more beneficial to students than a stack of 
newsprint in front of every library. As the 
administration is forced to cut back, it is t he 
responSIbility of the AS to ta ke up the lack. 

We at the Guardian support campus media, but are 
deeply disturbed with the irresponsible manner with 
which the AS has handled the Review issue: Elected , 
representatives are charged with. the task of making 
informed dcci"ions on matters of mteres t to students, 
not to panic and drop the ball every time controversy 
rears its head. 

But the AS has made its bed, and thi s election may 
prove to be a mistake, for it sets a dangerous 
precedent. The message seems clear: fund the Review 
or defund the entire campus media structure. 
Anything else would be wholly inconsistent wi th the 
ideals of constitutiona l govern ment.

Editor: 

The :,tudents of UCSD are 
faced with a very important 
issue; free speech. T h e 
q u estion of funding the 
Cali/ornia Review With 
student monies shou ld be 
answered with thi s concept 
and that of eq ua li ty in the 
fo r ef r ont of our min d s. 
Al though ma nyofu son theAS 
counci l do not agree with 
many of t he views stated in t he 
Review, we do beli eve in 
alte rnative media a nd the 
importance of th eir abi lity to 
print their views. If th is abi lit y 
is hampered due to lack of 
funds. we as th e students' 
representatives h ave a n 
obligation to fund them to the 
best of our abilities. 

Fortunately the issue of the 
Review is being taken out of 
our hands a nd placed in those 
of t he s tudents a t large. 
Sometime soon a cam puswide

Parts of UCSD became the 
scene of act ion for on·local ion 
shooting of the popular 
detective show. "Simon and

first half of the day was spent 
at Central Library. much to 
the dismay of stud1:!nts 
preparing for term papers and 
finals. On lookers reported that 
elevator access was limited 
due to filming in that area. 
Shouts of "cut!" were heard 
when an elevator crowd 
happened to open out on 
rolling cameras. 

The afternoon was spent on 
Third College quad , where 
"Rebecca the blind campus

continued from page 3 
administrators." Hecontinued 
to explain, "[n our systemwide 
administration the retiring 
president, Dr. Saxon, and two 
of his vice presidents are 
physicists. Something in the 
training of physicists seem to 
make them good admini· 
strators. " 

As provost of Revelle College 
Woo has had to make several 
decisions in his area of 
research; "You can't do things 
that are 'fashionable' because 
this job comes first. It doesn't 
matter whether it is an 
..evening or weekend. I can be in 
t he middle of an important 
research problem. and if a 
student calls, or if something 
happens at the college that [ 
need to attend tO,then I have to 
set the project aside." 

Woo feels that the present 
academic requirments at 
Revell are the backbone for the 
success that the college has 
had in the academic world. 

" Revelle's programs are 
well set, if there are any 
modifications for my own 
taste [ would like the addition 
of an International Relations 
program to th.e present 
curriculum. Our humaniites 
programs are very European· 
based, and I think studies of 
the third world would offer 
some balance." 

He supports the continua· 
tion of the language 
requirements that the college 
presently maintains: "I think 
children should be encouraged 
to be not only bi·lingual, but 
even tri·lingual. The more 
languages the better. It is 
important to start young. It is 
psychological to learn to fear 
learning different languages, 
if you start young then it is 
easier. In most countries the 
children in pre·school are 
already learning at least two 
languages." 

Woo has observed a com mon 
phenomenon in many A ian 
families in the United States. 
"They teach the children 

Chinese when they are young, 
but the minute they start 
kindergarden the parents 
panic and start thinking that 
the children can't really speak 
English, so they try to get 
them to give up speakin* 
Chinese, which is a mistake. 

Much of the success Woo 
has had the past four years at 
Revelle he attributes to his 
extremely well trained and 
dedicated staff at the college. 
"I really have a good staff, and 
a very good senior staff. 
People like Ernie Mort , they 
are so completely dedicated to 
the college, ·they have been 
working here close to 20 
years." 

Thi is the first time in the 
four years that Dr. Woo has 
been at Revelle that he has 
actively pursued a college 
presidency. He and his famil y 
enjoy living in California, and 
one of the first requirements 
for putting in applications was 
that they would stay here. He 
will be taking the place of 
retiring president Paul F. 
Romberg, who has been at San 
Francisco State University for 
the past 10 years. 

Speaking about the 
univers ity Woo said; "[ am not 
looking to make any dramatic 
changes. It is an exciting 
campus, very involved with 
the local community, and with 
a high standard of academic 
excellence ... 

"I have mixed fee\in~," said 
Woo, "at this point one can't 
help but be obviously excited. 
All ot a sudden there is so 
much to do. Up until a few 
days ago it didn't seem real at 
all. 1 felt like a spectator 
watching someone else." 

Reflecting on his tenure at 
Revelle, Woo is very sad about 
leaving the campus. "I can't 
put my finger on the 
highlights and lowlights of 
being here at Revelle college, 
because my feeling for the 
college are very strong." 

It is sure that he wi ll be 
missed by the faculty and 
,t udents at Revelle.

GRADUATION DAY

By WENDY PAULSON

Acid rain has been proven to 
affect the endurance of 
aluminum structures, 
according to recent research in 
the AMES department. 
Undergraduate Tom Helfrich 
conducted the 200 hours of 
experiments over a three·and· 
a·half month period, assisted 
by Professor M. T. Simnad. 

Cyclic tests were performed 
on aluminum rods called 
"coupons," which were put 
under variuos amounts of 
stress that pushed and pulled 
them until they broke. 
Coupons exposed only to air 
were tested, and the results 
compared to coupons soaked in 
acid rain . 

Comparisons showed that 
under various amounts of 
pressure, the "fatigue life" 
(amount of cracking under 
stress) of aluminum exposed 
to acid rain ranged from thirty 
to ninety percent less than the 
aluminum exposed only to air. 
Further experimentation 
s howed that the fractured 
pieces of acid rain·treated 
aluminum had deeper, more 
widespread cracking when 
viewed under an electron 
microscope, showing that the 
acid had attacked the metal. 

Helfrich gave a presentation 
at a regional conference of the 
American In stitute of 
Aeronautics and Astronautics, 
held in April of this year. He 

received second place lor his 
presentation out of 42 
competitors, and second place 
overall for his paper and 
presentation combined. 

These findings have 
implications in the building of 
aircraft, which are largely 
constructed of aluminum. 
Overall, aluminum with a 
potential life of ten years can 
be reduced to a life of three to 
seven years when exposed to 
acid rain. This project is only 
the first step in experimenta· 
tion with acid rain and alloys . 
Other metals and testing 
methods are recommended for 
future experimentation , 
which would ideally take place 
over a longer period of time 
and with greater funding. 

Killers For Reagan Aids

Reinhard Lettau, much 
loved professor of German 
literature. is losing his touch. 
In 1972 he was suspended for 
five days after striking a 
Marine recruiter at UCSD on 
the head with a rolled·up 
newspaper, a statement with 
both style and spontaneity:

Screen Extras Guild, but 
others can be used (and are 
paid) if necessary. When 
random passerbys wander 
onto rolling cameras, if they 
don 't affect the outcome of the 
scene, nobody worries about it. 
The planned extras looked 
quite fancy compared to the 
average UCSD st udent 
onlookers, and when one well 
attired blonde s trutted by, a 
female bystander comm· 
mented, " Is that what we're 
supposed to wear?" 

UCSD 's episode is s lated to 
be shown sometime in mid· 
October.

His lates t s tatement has

read: "Killers for Reagan. " 
This is not what we have come 
to expect; the sentiment is 
trite, neither original nor a 
classic quotation (except from 
the Hand SS stairwell). 
Literature professors ought to 
wax a little more eloquent on 
these occasions. What, after 
all, do we pay them for? 

It is true that given the 
circumstances Lettau could 
not spend too much time 
perfecting his style, and a 
rough draft was out of the 
question. Even then a 
graduate student observed 
him (you've noticed those 
graduate students loitering in 
Revelle), and called the police, 
who cornered Reinhard in a 
class he was teaching, and 
caught red·handed, literally. 
Let us recommend another

him time to come up with

rate for AIDS is 40% and for 
those diagnosed before 1981 it 
is double that figure. 

Acquired immune defic· 
iency syndrome is believed to 
be spread by a single agent, 
most likely a virus. This agent 
is believed to be spread in a 
number of ways. One is 
through exchange of infected 
body fluids , most often during 
sexual contact. This explaines 
why the syndrome has spread 
so rapidly through the 
homosexual community. 

The syndrome showed up 
originally in gays that were 
extremely promiscuous. In 
bath houses frequented by 
homosexuals, many of them 
will have numerous anony· 
mous contacts in one evening, 
thereby increasing their risk. 
It is now showing up in 
monogamous gays as well. 
With an estimated walking 
incubation period of up to two 
years , it is pos ible to have 
contracted AIDS before 
becoming monogamous.

infected is believed to _be IV 
drug u s ers . They ha ve 
contracted the sy ndrome 
through the second mode of 
transmission, exchange of 
blood products . Newsweek 
magazine reported a young 
AIDS victim that speed·balled 
(shooting heroin and cpcaine) 
twice a week who asserted 
that the same needle would 
"hang around for three or four 
weeks" in a "shooting gallery" 
where addicts would hangout. 
AIDS is then transfered to 
those who hoot up with the 
contaminated needle. Jt is 
believed that the syndrome 
spread to IV drug users from 
the homosexuals s ince 
approximately 5% of the gays 
that have contracted the 
sy ndrome used IV drugs. 

Hemophiliacs, people whose 
blood will not coagulate 
normally, have also contracted 
AIDS from blood products. 
Factor VIII, a blood clotting 
agent, is the mode of 
transmission. Every dose of 
Factor VIII is made from the 
plasma of about 20,000 people. 
Somewhere down the line, an 
AIDS carrier donated blood 
that contaminated lheplasma, 
passing t he syndrome on to 
whoever used tha t partIcul ar 
dose of Factor VIII. 

No one is quite sure how the 
"'\ ndrome has been trans· 
niitted to recent Haitian 
refugees that are neit her 
homosexual nor IV drug users. 
Doctor William Foege. director 
of the C eni ers for Dlsense

"Shall the Associated Students of 
UCSD deny Activity Fee funds to 
the California Review and so 
nullify the allocation to this paper 
that the AS Council made on 
June 1st, 1983." 

ASUCSD · SPECIAL REF 
THURS. & FRI. 

Vote YES to Save Student Funds 
• The California Review has proven its ability to sustain 

substantial off-campus financial support. 
• They are not a student paper. 
• The issue is responsible allocations, 

not free speech. 
The California Review has other 

sources of funding available to it, which 
have enabled it to publish for over a year 
without recourse to student fees. The 
Review received thousands of dollars from 
corporations and foundations last year, and 
told the A.S. Media Board that they expect 
to receive more than $5,000 in such support 
again next year. 

When funds are limited we have to ask 
o urselves whether we can afford to fun d 
everyt h i n g t h at comes al o ng. 
Organizations with external sou rces of 
funding should not receive student fees. 

Is the California Review really a student 
paper? Although the Review is distributed 
at UCSD, the paper rarely relates to student 
concerns. Instead most of each i<;sue is 
w ritten by off-campus pe ople about off-
ca mpu s issues. It 's paid for by non -
stude nts, Non-students write 90% of all 
letters to the editor printed in the Review . 
The paper is commercially typeset, pasted 
up and printed off-campus. The Review is 
not a campus paper; students shouldn 't pay 
for it. 

Is the Associate d Students (AS) listening 
to stude nts at a ll ? The AS ignored mass 
op p osit ion to fun di ng t h e Revi ew , 
includi ng more than 60 stud e nts who 

attended the Council meeting to voice 
their opposition. It ignored its own 
resolution deploring the Review's cavalier 
treatment of rape, In response to this 
injustice, 1300 students signed petitions to 
place this allocation before a student vote. 
The AS's decision to fund the Reviewwas at 
least unrepresentative and borders on 
being irresponsible, 

The issue is whether we as students wish 
to see our support fees used to fund the 
Ca lifornia Review, not whe ther they 
shou ld be a ll owed to pu bl is h . No 
publrcation wi th the su bs tantial fina nc ia l 
support enjoyed by the Review is in any 
danger of ha vin g its free speec h righ t.; 
de n ied, beca use it will continue tf) publ is l 
whe th e r students pay for it or not. 

The Review does not represent a 
legitimate alternate viewpoint. Its jokes 
about rape, its racial slurs, and the like do 
not inform or educate students. They may 
have a right to publish this material, but we 
have a right to refuse to foot the bill. Free 
speech is not the issue. 

We have better things to do with student 
fees. Vote YES, vote to overturn the 
decision to allocate rare student fees to the 
California Review. 

Why Fund the Review? 

For those of you not familiar with 
the California Review, a few 
excerpts follow: 

" Dr. [Jerryl Falwell is indeed a com-
passionate man. When asked if he felt 
that Herpes was God's judgement, or 
revenge, he replied : 'God is a God of 
love .. .' he also is a God of justice who 
said : 'Whatsoever a man' or society, 
corporately 'soweth , that shall that 
man: or society, ' reap .' " 
" We assert these truths : Men are men, 
women are women, and homose xuals 
are in a subphylum by themselves .. . " 
" Throughout the Third World almost 
eve ryone takes pride in hi s ancient 
ghosts and goblins .... It addles the 
brains of all the mediocre graduate 
students sent by Third World 
governments 10 make off wllh Ih('

" CR: What would you say about 
'Women's Studies ' as an academic 
endeavor? 
" Schafly: I would say that at best, 
Women's Studies is a waste o f time. 
And at worst, it is a positive detrim ent 
to society. Many of them could be 
accurately described as courses in 
how to brea k up a marriage. I be li eve

One-Seventh (1/7) Of The Student Body Signed This Petition in 3 Days: 
On Jun e 1st , the Associ ated Stude nt s Counc il allocated $4050 of Campus Activity Fees (the $8 
th at every unde rgraduate pays when he/ she registers) to the California Review. Although we 
be li eve that they have a right to free speec h, because we do not want to show support for 
the ir views and because we fee l that they do not represent us as students, we do not want our 
stud e nts fund s to be used to support this paper. As per Article II, Section M, Part 2 of the AS 
Constitu tion , we, the undersigned members of the ASUCSD, call for a referendum to be 
presented to the ge neral stude nt body asking : 
"Shall the Associa ted Stude nts of UCSD deny Activity Fee fund s to the California Review and 
so nullify the alia ati o n to th is pa pe r th at the AS Council made on Jun e 1st, 1983."

tional reform is reverted to the 
last century by the UC system 
for people who have the wrong 
beliefs: a life sentence, again 
without th~ benefit of trial. 

The UC's new role does not 
suit it. Legal matters should be 
left t(} the FBI and the Justice 
Department, who have 
practice in fairness under the 
law and do not invent their 
own eccentricities of the law. 
Nor do these organizations act 
as judge and jury and penal 
system: they merely police. 
Other schools in other states 
give their students aid to take 
the place of the federal funds

on the mere intent of providing

• BASEBALL 
After the glory and hoop-I a 

of a trip to China in December, 
Skipper Lyle Yates and the 
basebasll team suffered 
through a tough season where 
just about everything went 
wrong a long the way through 
a 9-30 campaign.. Numerous 
injuries crippled the team at 
the outset. Repeated rainouts 
bored them early. Stolen 
equipment demora lized them 
half way through . It wasn 't 
u nti l the end of the year that 
the squad began to put it 
together. They regrouped in 
time to make the playoffs but 
lost in the first round. The 
Tritons were led by All -
Everything Mike Brown. Un~il 
he became ineligible, that IS. 
Freshman Scott "Scooter" 
Melendrez was superb for the 
c lub wit h a .320 batting 
average. David Jankowski 
played wizard third base and 
UCLA transfer Joe Wolf 
pounded ot a big impression in 
the late going, but by then, the 
season was put Lo rest.

• MEN'S BASKETBALL 

Perhaps the story of UCSD 
sports in 1983 was high 
expectations with nOL·so-high 
resu lts. This was never more 
evident t han in the men's 
basketball season . Before the 
quad had even picked up a 

basketball , Head C03ch John 
Block a nd Assista nt Tom 
Marsha ll were saying that the 
'82-'83 Tritons would not only 
cha llengt: Westmont for the

league title , but have an 
excellent opportunity to 
advance to Kan as city as the 
NAIA District III representa-
tive. The resul ts were far from 
the lofty goals . UCSD 
accumulated a meager 13·]3 
record through the season, and 
was eliminated innocently 
enough in t he fir t round of t he 
playoffs by Asuza Pacific. 
HOwever, one cannot say that 
Block and Mars hall were 
unjustified in making their 
predictions, because the 
Tritons were capable - at 
times - of playing quintes· 
sent ial basketball. One on Iy 
needs to look back to the Feb, 
20 double overtime 64-60 
v ictory against previously 
unbeaten Westmont. Unfor-
tunate l y, those kind of 
performances were few and 
far too infrequent. Losing Bob 
Goodman and Mike Maross to 
graduation will hurt, but 
Brandon Nixon and Steve 
F li nt s hou ld beable Lo step into 
t heir ' hoes adequate ly. Even 
though t he season e.nded 
quickly for Block and fnends 
in '83, no one can say that the 
brand of basketball played 
duri ng the past two years has 
been anything but exciting, 
Excitement a nd a few more 
wins s hou ld come aplenty next 
season. 

-Mike G reenberg 

• WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
The Lady Tritons had what 

you would call a banner year in 
1983. With an explosive fast 
break offense and a good 
defense, the Tritons enjoyed 
the best year in UCSD 
women's basketball his tory by 
finishing with an impressive 
17·9 record. Incredibly, four 
players finished the ea on 
with a scoring a verge in double 
figures : Paulette Parker, Teik 
Francis, Brenda Sweatt, and 
Julie Krau se. Francis was the 
key at center a Coach Judy 
Malone's offense revolved 
around her. Franci s led the 
Tritons in rebounding with a 
10.6 per game average. 
Jennifer Gregory fini s hed 
second in that category with a 
10.1 mark . Freshman Shelley 
McKeone also contributed well 
as the Tritons fini s hed fifth in 
the Western Regional s. 
Unfortunately, only the first 
four Leams qualified for the 
playoffs. A glorious season 
just as well . 

-Jeff Savage 
• SWIMMING 

Perhaps the best season of 
swimming at UCSD climaxed 
with top ten national finishe 
by bot h the men 's and 
women's squads. The men 's 
team, after a 5-3 dual season, 
sent a total of ten swimmers to 

the Nationals in Ohio. Eight of 
the ten returned a~ All-
Americans as Coach Bill 
Morgan led his team to a sixLh 
place showing at the Div. III 
tournament. The women 
placed one pot higher after a 
3-5 dual season which 
qualified II swimmers for the 
Nationals competitIOn. Nine 
women earned All-American 
honors as UCSD took fifth 
place . Among the -nany school 
records smashed by both the 
men and women was a 
nationa l record In the zoo f1v 
by Athlete of the Year Lee 
Morrow. Prospects for next 
season look promising as the 
Triton s exit the Miramar 
structure for the more 
accumodatlng pool at the 
UC D Rec Center. e\'eral 
returnees shou ld combine 
with recruits for a 1984 season 
to rival 1983':;,

This Final Week in Intramurals 
8) GREGORY MaL-CRONE 

"'taff Writer 
As most of you know. UCSD has no foot ball team. 

Perhaps this lack of a glory squad to rally amund 
e.xplains why the intramural program here IS so 
strong. If that is the reason then so be 11, for the 
participation by the more than 1.200 teams and 
12,300 players who took part in UCSD 1M this year 
goes far beyond any activity that would have 
surrounded the 40 or so players on a football squad. 
In the past five years, overalI participation has 
increased 70 percent, with floor hockey, volleyball, 
badminton, and bowling leading the way. Kudos to 
all of you that have made the 1M program a rousing 
success. Thanks are due in large part to 1M 
chieftains Mike Hipp and Scott Berndes, who have 
molded all of the sports assistants, referees, and 
players into one of the most successful programs i.n 
the nation. The final 1M report is as follows: 
INNER TUBE WATER POLO 

The single·A Dorks, led by Allison Schoenfeld 
and Dave Karel, pulled the surprise of the year (as

far as their opponents were concerned) in beating 
More Wet Foxes this past week in the Triton 
Natatorium. Allison scored three times for six points 
and Dave scored four times in leading Dork to a 15·5 
win and the single·A championship. 

[n the AA semifinal engagement, Pump Twice 
and Shoot prematurely withdrew from the playoff 
picture unfulfilled after having lost an anti· 
climactic match·up to Wet Panties. Carolyn 
Shuggart led the Panties with six points. Mimi 
Isham of the Pump scored four, but in a losing effort, 
]2·9. 

After finding out who their championship match 
opponent was going to be, the omnipotent 
Aquacows proceeded to shred the Panties by a 
score of 17·5. Allison "Doe" (''I'm not a deer, but a 
female cow") wa the high scorer for the Cows. 

De pite Dan Eby's five goal effort, hi SKLIF 
compatriots failed to muster enough offense to 
defeat Gearheads in this AAA final. Tom Enger.

A Sumnlary of the Week 
And Thoughts on the Year 
teams will meet in the single·A finab tonight; check 
it out. 

Meanwwhile, Momettes will take on the B· 
Ballers (incorrectly printed a "V·Ballers" la~t 
week), after having defeated the much·touted HB's 
this past week, in the match for the AA women's v-
ball crown. 
BASKETBALL 

On Monday night, teams composed of house 
members fr('~:-I Tioga and Tenaya halls, as well as 
the apartments, battled it out in deciding the Muir 
basketball championship, a yearly (and sometimes 
twice yearly) happening. The games were played to 
11 (counting by ones) with a double elimination 
format. E·house and F-house were the number one 
and two seeds, respectively, as decided by Al Reyes, 
the coordinator of the event, andJeff Bass, the Muir 
H.A. in charge of IMs for the residence halls. Thank 
you both for your work. 

The first two games of the evening pitted the 
"A's" vs. the "Jays" and H·house against G-house. 
Phil Pettis led the onslau~ht against the Jays, 
coring fuly nine of his team s 11 points, as lhouse 

won the tournament's first match by a score of 11-8. 
The team of Dave Monks and AI Reyes was too much 
for the "G-house five" combining for six of their 
team's total, despite Scott Thompson's five point 
fury; H-house won 11-9. 

After sitting out the first round due to a couple of 
byes, E and F·housescoa ted toa couple of easy wins 
over H-house andJhouses, respectively, by scores of 
11 ·7 and 11-2. The third round consisted of lwomore 
wins for these two top·ranked teams. F-house 
knocked off the tough apartment team, 11 -6, on the 
trength of Brian Mequet and FrankStillman" four-

The appearance of the two participants In the 
winner" bracket final came as no surpri~c. for the 
stage had been set wit h both E and F·houses having 
each won t heir on ly games played. F·house. perhaps 
a bit miffed at being seeded secund to E·house, took 
to the court with a vengeance. Once again Brian 
Mequet led the way with four points. Mark 
Eddlestein also scored four and Peter Kalos chipped 
in three. Guttridge (from E) was held to a point but 
had numerous blocked shots and rebounds; Scott 
Leavitt was high scorer for E-house with three 
buckets. E-house lost in a not·so·close game, 15·7, 
and as a resu It would play the apartment team in the 
loser's bracket final; F would await the winner in 
the championship game. 

The Jim Mergy·led apartment team proceeded 10 

The omnipotent Aqua Cows

eliminate the "eggs" from E·house. [n scoring seven 
of his team 's 15 baskets, Mergy led all scorers. His 
aggre:;sive play and teammate Jon Koenig's five· 
point effort were more than enough to vault their 
team into the championship vi!' a 15· ] 0 victory. 

One could have described the atmosphere as 
intense. Bot h teams badly wanted to win, with the 
apartment team want ing to avenge its earlier loss to 
F-house; it would be an exciting match·up. Mequet 
got F off to an early lead", ith several quick baskets 
before the apartments came to life. Gus antoyo hit 
a couple of 20-25 footers to pull his squad close and 
the battle began with Mequet and Mergy alternating 
hoops. Santoyo cont inued to hit his 20·foot jump 
hots as did Mequet wit h hi fierce under·the·basket 

play. The game ended with the boys from F-house 
stavi ng off a late·game surge and winning on a 
Frank Stillman 16-foot, nothing·but-net jump hot. 
Final score 15·13 and Muir championsh ip to F-
house. 

My all-tournament team, which is completely 
1!.ubjective and based on what I saw out on the 
cou rt s, is as follows:

WHAT'S GOING ON HERE DEPT. SIIlC{, tIll' nex t (,l/ardwlI 
issue will 110t be ~een by the public (\\e plan to pU I)lIsh an ' 
underground propagilnda sport;. newspaperdunngthe sllT11 mer) 
until I he third weeK of September, we thought you wou Id like to 
know what will be ocurring tn ( he sport ing world as of t hat date: 
&/seball:TheSan Francisco Gianls will havejust passed theLos 
Angeles Dodgers bv sweepi ng a four game serie~ at Dodger 
Stadium. Atlanta will be three games back , and our Padres will 
be 16 behind the leaders, s ituated in fourth place. As forthe other 
division s, briefly, theteams in front will be:NLEast-Chicago, 
ALEast- Milwaukee,AL West -California; Foothall:TheNFL 
season will have been underway for two weeks, and the 
Chargers will have dropped their first two games despite a very 
improved defense. Problem: no offense. A long holdout by 

. Quarterback Dan Fouts and the aging of Chari ieJoiner and many 
of the offen ive linemen will cause San Diego to be shut out in the 
opener and limited to seven points in game two. 
NOT TO BE BELIEVED DEPT. Only 1700-plu~ showed up 
for Monday night's ockers game at t he Stadium. It seems that 
we are the only ones who appreciate the finer points of ouldoor 

~occer, not the pinball 'occer that is played in indoor arenas that 
everyone is so enthralled with. 
WAIT A MINUTE DEPT, Why is one of the best televis ion 
announcers being paired with one of lhe most incompetent on 
Sunday USFL telecasts. After the Michigan Pant her offense had 
controlled the ball for 43 of the last 49 plays against the 
Philadelphia Slars and were on the move again, ABC 
commentator Lynn Swann said, ''I'll go way out on a limb and 
predict that the Michigan offense is going to make it a rough day 
for the Philadelphia defense." Gosh Lynn, what courage. 
Compare this to one of the best in the business, Keith Jackson, 
who handles the play·by·play with the skill of a seasoned veteran 
- which he is. We wonder if ABC has the courage to stick two 
play-by-play men in the booth together; giving Swannie the boot 
and replacing him with AI Michaels would be a marvelous move. 
THEY ASKED FOR IT DEPT. When Owner Donald Sterling 
took over con.trol of the San piego Clippers two years ago. people 
were asking If he was going to be an improvement from former 
owner [rv Levin . A year pas ed and they were still a king. Now, 
with the hiring of Portland Assistant CoachJim Lymann, people 
have finally received the an wer· a definte no. Why Sterlingdis-
regarded the advice of Gtv1 Paul Phipps and Assi tant Coach Pete 
Babcock. who wanted Oalias' Bobby Weiss, is beyond us . 
COULD IT BE DEPT. Finally, without your support, your 
angry letters, you r irate phone calls, we wou ld not have been able 
to produce a long running column this year. We take this 
opportunity to thank all of you for your help. 
NOTE: This is tile IOIlf! COl 'tD IT BE DEPT. tliat holds Iyue.

The .. nd lows Out 
Any good orsanlzatlon will tell you 

that it's the peopte from within that 
make l1l'i Of9cV1ization great Intramurat 
Sports at the Big "u" is certainly no 
different It took the dedicated III'Id 
concerted effort of f:Ner 1 SO peopte to 
bring you the Intramurat Program in 
1982-83, Most of them were sports 
ollldats, referees, u"1)ires, line judges, 
timers, what have you, You may have 
had a disagreement with one or two of 
them f:Ner the pest nine months, but 
nearly all of them to the letter were out 
there trying to give you the best job 
that they could. leading this group of 
hardy souls into "battle" was a smatler 
unit, a "brewer's six-pack" If you will, 
that had accumulated its seasoning 
aver many tate nights and long 
weekend afternoons of intramurat 
action, This crack unit, perhaps the best 
we've ever had here, is for the most 
part bowing out this week, after 
seemingly endless months of devoted 
service. 1M Sports at UCSD would be 
mUCh, much less without their 
consistently strong efforts and their 
overwhelming friendly spirit and 
enthusiasm. They've been here at UCSD 
a long time, perhaps too long in some 
cases, but they certainly deserve one 
more testimonial and a tip of the 
Budman's cap. In no particular order 
they are: 

Kim Dudo (8th year Senior) ... the 
patriarch of students CIt UCSD ... Kim 
likens himself to baseball's Pete 
Rose ... he'li stay on campus until he has 
claimed every individual record that 
there is. Currently, Kim is closing In on 
career marks for most units attempted 
at a Single university (495), most grades 
of "A" in academic classes (every one 
ever taken), and most oil changes in a 
college career (96). And folks, here's 
the kicker. Yes, Kim will be back next 
year!!! Apparently hiS chance to be the 
1M Campus Rep for Valvoline Motor Oil 
WClS too good to pass up. But we really 
think It's because his 1M hockey team 
didn't make the play-ofts thiS past 
winter. 

Kevin Gunning (7th year 
Senior) ... another 1M greybeard, Kevin 
was the velvet voice of Triton volleyball 
this past season. At the prestigious 
NCAA Volleyball Championships at 
UCSD in December, Kevin cameupwith 
a beauty, ale Jerry Colell1Cln. While 
Introducing the teams from UCSD and 
Juniata College of Pa., our amigo 
Keveeno couldn ' t help but 
"Mexlcanlzlng" the word Juniate. It 
came out "Hoon'ata" and brought 
down the house 

Kevin had a tremendous athletiC year 

Softball Playoff Preview -
Men'sMA 

.A.AA at the beginning of the season 
looked like a shoe-In for Get-A-Grlp to 
repeat as champions. They returned 
their whole squad in tact from their 
championship season of 1982. But 
things have changed. They seemed to 
have gotten their priOrities mixed up 
on the way to the ir second 
championship. Just beclluse they are 
third yeer Med students lind spend 
every waking hour, and sleeping hour, 
at University Hospital is no excuse. 
/lllaybe it's ege fellas. 

It now looks to be a toss-up to win It 
Brutal Puppydogs, who defeated Gat-
A-Grip handily twice In league plCIY, 
looks to be a slight faVOrite. Led by the 
pitching of Cary lindstrom and the 
hitting of Glenn Calta they w ill be tough

crown this week in Men's softball ... but 
that still doesn't mean he's a very good 
e!thlete. Teams usually want him 
because he doesn't hog all of the beer 
at team parties. 

TIm Sullivan (7th year Senior) .. .Mr. 
InVisible around the 1M office .. .Tim 
usually stuck around just long enough 
to pick up his paycheck every month 

The Original "Ham Whllt I Am,'" 
Slllyman stole the show at Casino Night 
in /lllarch with his improvised rendition 
of "New york, New York." It was the 
highlight of an othelWlse lack-luster 
college career. Timmy's 1M teams 
usually choked in the play-ofts, the 
Dartmouth-UCSD Exchange Program 
was nearly cancelled after he spent FilII 
Quarter of '81 back east, and his 
"brain" jokes h-'Ve proceeded to 
alienate every female on campus."that 
is except his girlfriend, Jill, who must be 
pretty weird herself. 

Leonard Shulman Uust a regular 
Senior) ... Lenny was the Sammy Glick of 
1M Sports In 1983. Nobody moved 
through the ranks qUicker. From Lenny 
the Nothing, to Lenny the Ref, to Lenny 
the Sports ASSistant, to Lenny the 1M 
Director, Shulman proceeded to mow 
down everything in his path on his way 

Rabbis to the disqualification bowl 
(there will only be one team on the 
field. They are all the same players ), 
make It a two team race, Only Queens 
Drag Bunt should make It into the fi nal. 
The Queens led by the powered hitting 
of Scott Johnson and the defense of 
Phil DesJarden appear primed and 
ready. Bob's Breath is so strong teams 
have been known to think Bob never 
brushes. It can't be just the dreaded 
morning breath because Bob plays all 
his games in the late afternoon. This 
team msy breathe easy until they meet 
the Queens in the final 

Budman's ~ Obviously, Queens. 
Look for Cock to be a possible longshot

Men's A 
Another 2 team diVISion. It Will end 

up With a rematch of the June 4th 
dream game between the Llngusmen 
and the Backdoor Men That was a 
claSSIC. Two good teams plaYing before 
a record regular season SRO crowd of 
57 screaming fans And you thought 
the Padre-Dodgers gamO';s ha."e big 
crowds 

to ultimate power, prestige, and "The 
MOst Beautiful Man In the World" title. 
Only an understanding 1M staff and 
student body that knew he was "sick" 
kept him from getting barbecued 
regularly. 

Amanda Prentice (an irregular 
Senior) ... being the only female on a 
male-dominated sta ff had its 
advllntages lind d isadvantages . 
Amanda took the usual onslaught of 
abuse that guys Will dole out, and 
handled it rather nicely However, she 
usually evened the score at staffparties 
by throwing her arms around your neck 
just as your wife or girlfriend would 
walk In. 

Amanda earned the respect of her 
referees by baking them cookies 
before their matches, The message she 
was really trying to get across was that 
she really wants to dump her valuable 
UCSD education and become II 
housewife and mother. In fact, she just 
recently announced her engagement. 
They plan to be married right after the 
Olympic Games. No folks, not the LA 
Games in 1984. The ones in Tehran in 
1988. I gUeSsihe wants to get to know 
the guy. 

Todd Wallon (thllnk God, he's a 
Senior) ... easily the best patio sweeper 
in the Department. Waddy had a knack 
for ducking undercuts in basketball, 

Bud man's pick: The Backdoor Men to 
reverse the dream game outcome. 

CocdM 
Flip a coin and you Will have as much 

chance of picking a favorite here as the 
Budman and his always relillble crystal 
ball. You've got some classy squads 
here all with a chance to win it. John 
Stabler and Stroke It Up The Middle 
looks strong but they got beat late in 
the season, Sliding and Pseudo Drabos 
can plCIY some ball. The Bone MIIchine 
seems to be boned up and ready to 
bone. Dynasty is trying to live up to it's 
name. A tough pick here. 

Budman's pick. Whiff and it's 
experience. 100 total years of 1M play at 
UCSD must mean something

If you ever needed to find him, the 
best place to look was cuddled up next 
to his girlfriend at the Warren parking 
lots, 

Always Immaculately groomed, 
Wllddy was the fashion-plate of the 1M 
Staff. Pink shirts, designer jeans, and 
sometimes an earring. The earrings 
looked so good that the directors are 
thinking of ordering one for each and 
every one of their referees and umpires 
next year. 

Alan Friedman (gets to be a Senior, 
again) ... Big AI was the hard·luck guy in 
IMs this year. On his way to a 
spectacular senior year AI was 
destined to win 1M championships in 
three sports, find a steady girlfriend, 
graduate, and go on to a prestigious 
law school. 

Unfortunately, a rather serious eye 
injury put all of those objectives on ice 
just a few months ago. In fact things 
have gone from bad to worse. Big AI is 
now marooned In Los Angeles, is 
getting fat lind out of shape, hasn't had 
a date in weeks, gambles all of his 
money iSWay in Vegas regularly, and has 
to come back to UCSD next year to 
finish everything up. Fret not, Big AI, no 
matter how crappy things are, we'll still 
tllke you back. 

he feels she IS only there so they won't 
forfeit. Come on ladles stand up and be 
heard! ) 

Budman's pick; No Easy Outs. With a 
name like that they should win. 

Women'sM 
Brown Sugar, the top seed, already 

has lost which has thrown this division 
wacko. It looked like Brown Sugar and 
nobody else until they lost to the 
turtles of !III 1M SOftbllli, We've Got No 
\lllheeis. The D-Street Band and Flying 
Fangs look to be the favOrites. ' 

Bodmao's pick; Soft BriSWlers. Lots of 
talent will win it. 

Women'IA 
The Women 's A diviSion IS IIlways 

hard to pick. But this year it looks like 
the Los Chingones should win it all. 
Great overllil team speed and plaYing 
In a tough diVISion should help them 
win It. The sentimental chOICe here IS 
the Batterers. Always oul there to have 
a good time lind enJoy themselves, It 
would be nice to see them win 

Budman's J}~k Los Chlngones. Too

FOR ALL YOU DO ... THIS 
BUD PAGE IS FOR YOU! 

One More Time for the 
Empty Bccr Can Awards 

It's almost (;NCr for the year. Hard to 
believe but true, Another superlative 
year of fun and games down at the 1M 
Ranch. As Volleyball, Softball, and 
Ultimate Disc close out the Intramurlll 
clliendar today, tomorrow, and this 
weekend, it's only fitting that we 
resurrect another long-standing UCSD 
trlldition. 

The Annual Empty Beer Clln Awards 
(EBCAs) are upon us again. Time to dole 
out a few last parting shots on 1111 of you 
who have made intramurals fun and 
exciting lit UCSD, Before you le-'Ve for 
summer, retlect back with us on some 
of the highlights and lowiights of our 
intramural year. Read 'em, but don't 
weep. You earned every one of 'em. 

-------------------

Molt HII .. toul Sight of the 1M 
Year ... Tom Doupe (Swllmp) walking 
the first hole at Torrey Pines in the 1M 
GolfT ournament with a full keg of beer. 

Molt Pathetic Sight of the 1M 
Ye ..... Tom Doupe passed out on the 
third hole under a shade tree with II 
half-cmpty keg of beer. And it was only 
8:00 in the morning. 

CSO of the YeM __ .Scott Johnson 
(Only Queens Drag Bunt) ... Scott was a 
camp-out speCialist at 1111 UCSD 
Recreation facilities any time 1M Sports 
were taking place. Girls were always 
safe when Scott was arou nd while they 
pisyed IMs, but anywhere else we 
weren't always sure. 

MIlle ChccrIuder of the Yar. __ Jlm 
Bishop (Megacrushers)"Bish was the 
master of the famous spetlout, which 
delighted Jim's parents immensety. 
They spent a fortune on his education 
and they got a tremendous return on 
their Investment. Jim can now spell his 
alma mater on any resume, and has 
recelwd a post-graduate schol .. shlp 
to study cheer1eadlng at the University 
of Oklahoma. 

Female Cheerleader of the 
Year ••• Valerie Anders (TKE Little 
Sistcrs) ... this foxy redhead had a 
storied intramural career after 
transferring from USIU, She was II 
landslide winner of the Hula 8ow1 
Queen contest in 1982, the very first 
coin-nipper in the 1M Team Captains 
Meeting lottery the same year, and the 
first female ever to stop traffic in the 
bougeois Club Med during lunch hour. 

Belt 1M Team Unlfonnl __ .Ludes for 
Allah (Men AA Football ) .. .Mohammed 
Orgell, Ahmad Japooni Driver and the 
rest of the Ludes sported the very best 
sheik headgear In college football. 

Q)~ 

1M BUllnell Tycoon of the 
Year ... Dave Tollner (HL Knights) ... 
Rumor has it that Dllve will forego his 
final year of school and intramurals to 
open II Der Weinerschnitzel Hot Dog 
stand near campus courtesy of the AS. 

1M Coaches of the Year,.,Mlltt 
Adams and Tom Jones (Sw!lmp) ... their 
suits weren't by Brooks Bros. and their 
coaching didn't remind you of Jim 
Valvano, but these two looney birds 
made 1M referees earn every bit of their 
$5.38. 

IteBle *",on/Joe Hamath Award 
for Excessive CockInal ... Tim Pickwell 
(BSU, Dynasty) ... Capt. Pickwell slithered 
into the 1M Office on regular occasions 
to extole the virtues of his AI~ 
Everything athlctcs. ,Always trying to 
get a few lines of type in the Bud Page, 
You'd think a guy that wrote his own 
paper would understand that a real 
newspaper man can't be bribed. 

1M 5wccthc.u of the Y .... .Jackie 
Jaqulnt and Angela Arndt (Sets and 
Violence) ... these two lovelies were the 
antithesis of the typical 1M Loudmouth. 
They quietly went about playing in 
nearly everything intramurats had to 
offer, and were very good in almost 
everything. But you'd never knovv It 
listening to them. LOSing this pair is 
going to hurt. 

Futu ... 1M Stars of TOIIIOITow, •• Steve 
Losli and Gayle Flanders (Superstars) ... 
these two relative newcomers came 
into their own this year In almost 
everything, including spendid 
performances in the Superstars AI~ 
Sports Competition. LoSlI, only a 
sophomore, ran up 5819 paints, lind 
Flanders totalled 5390 in the loose, but 
gruelling four-day event. It should be 
fun to watch these two In an OlympIC 
year.

compllny while you worked, MIItt lind 
Woody would be happy to oblige you. 

Bjorn Borg "Icemen" Award ... lamie 
Mehraz (Pllrs ) and Jody Ma i 
(Flollties) ... No players in all of 
intramurals were liS cool under fire as 
these two, When the IntenSity of the 
game picked up, nobody could handle 
it as well as lamie and Jody. 

MOlt Influential Intramural 
Athlete .. _Llsa Johnson (Aqua 
Cows) ... Llsa's captivating charm can 
crumble even the stodgiest of 
curmudgeons. Her relentless plells for 
mercy resulted In the AquII Cows first 
ever 1M waterpolo championship. 

Non-Playoff Game of the 
Year ... Llngusmen vs. Backdoor Men 
(Men 's A Softball) .. Just last SIIturday 
this titllntic struggle between two 6-0 
teams set 1111 kinds of attendance 
records for IMs. Sorry folks, we didn't 
know Intramurllis were that serious, For 
the record, Llngusmen broke up II close 
game In the 6th lind won handily 10-3, 

Bat Tum In 1MI .. ,Just Plain Great 
(Men AA Bllsketball ) .. .tor sheer 
teamwork nothing matched the job 
these guys did. 3(}point wins were 
routine for this juggernaut. Doug Lisle, 
TIm Bolden III'Id the boys pi¥d the 
game like it was designed to be pisyed. 

Worst Cue of Intrlmural 
SChlzop ........... Brian Lariviere ... Brian's 
teams could easily send a grown man 
to the funny farm. His marginally 
talented tellms always won 
championships (Gcarheads), while his 
exceptionally talented ones choked on 
the big olive (Raposa Inn & Out, 
Hardwood). 

1M Nitpick of the Year .. _Mike 
McKeown (Blomavericks) ... Mike 
inherits the crown previously worn by 
his teammate Kenn Buckley. Rumor has 
it that Mike runs computer anlllysis of 1111 
intramural rules and regulations, and 
then takes speCial delight in roasting 17 
year old freshmen umpires on the 
sophisticated intricaCies of how II 
p itched softball can legally and Illegally 
be delivered 

Best Contribution to an 1M 
Sport ... Larry Gol dman (Kiss My 

~ 

Disc) .. . l..IIrry started the Ultlll1Clte DISC 
program, developed the rules, taught 
everyone how to plllY, officiated most 
of the gemes, and more or less put thiS 
baby on the 1M map. It's now over 50 
teams strong and moving forward. Give 
an assist to Elana Rosen and Hans 
Wiersma for their help too. Thllnks you 
guys. 

Airhead of the Yur .. ,l..IIszlo Gyorffy 
(PWP) .. no contest here. Laz has more 
space between hiS ears than you'd find 
In CI Goodyellr Bllmp. l..llz lost hiS IM job 
II couple t imes over for fa il 109 to 
understllnd CI common employment 
principle. In order to do a job, you do 
have to show up for work. 

Best Intramural Attltude ... DCl n 
Walters (TKE) thiS happy-go-lucky guy 
never seemed to have a problem 10 the 
world. Always played and WOrked 
harder thCln most...Clnd at the end of 
the dllY he'd usuCll1y reward himself 
w ith a b ig meal. 

Belt Team Intramural Attitude ... 
Stop the Bus lind Let My Brother 
Jacques Off (Wllterpolo)."these guys 
had barbecues, CliP nights, IUIIUS, lind 
all kinds of other promotions to help 
spice up the boredom of their 1M 
games every week. And in the end they 
played their motto out to the 
hilt ... "Docs It really matter?" 

Molt Unique All-Around AtNctc •• _ 
Stacey Brown .. Stace has talent to 
give awllY in most sports but his WIlY of 
combining them is a little unusual, 
\lllhen was the last time you ever met a 
high-hurdling golfer who could also 
plsy hockey and football with the best 
of them. 

MOlt Prepared Intramural 
Athlete, •• Rlck Wilbert (York Hunt Club, 
Superstars) ... RIck, a two-time individual 
champion in Superstars, knew his limits 
and abilities as closely as a guy can. If he 
wasn't always physically ready and he 
almost always was, he mentally 
dissected his athletic objective like (I

A day at the races begins 
with the scratch sheets . 
Contained within them is the 
preliminary data: line' ups, 
odds-makers' favorites, and 
horses' past performances. In 
the meantime. a regular group 
of spectators will play cards 
and drink beer every morning. 
No one ever wonders why 
these distinguished elderly 
gentlemen don't perform this 
act somewhere else, like in a 
house. It is just generally

to play cards and drink beers, 
one goes to the track. 

By noon or 12:30 the 
occasional track fan begin to 

arriv~. Soon reruns of 
yesterday's races start on the 
television monitor overhead, 
the call echoing in the . 
ca vernous concrete floored 
grandstand. This place is 
huge. On weekends, 70,000 
can find their way in to watch 
a big stakes race. People 
congregate on the benches and 
clog the stairways. Unlike 
what you would expect at 
football, baseball, or 
basketball contests, the 
res trooms at the races are 

never full. Strange. but I have 
never really dwelled on this 
phenomenon. Nor have I tried 
to understand why practically 
no one steals or is stolen from 
at a race track. Thieves will go 
out of their way not to steal. 
Countless times I have seen 
people drop bills or, worse, 
winning tickets onto the 
ground. only to see them 
retrieved and returned to the 
owner by the person standing 
next to them. It is almost as if 
there is an unwritten rule at 
all tracks that "there will be no 
stealing of any kind 
whatsoever!" The funny thing 
about it all is that everyone 

porting events, these fans 
tend to station themselves far 
apart from one another. Some 
bring lunch in a bag. Some 
drink lunch from a bag. 

The pari·mutuel windows 
open at 1. Money rolls in 
immediately. Everything is 
computerized . The tote board 
and metrix board (similar to 
"Diamond Vision" at Dodger 
Stadium) light up. The odds of 
the horse appear, blink, 
change. The countdown to

.WOMEN'S T ENNIS 

The women 's tennis team 
rode through mo t of the 
season as the top Divis ion III 
squad In the nation. This 
position was secured with an 
early eason defeat of 1982's 
national champIOn, Occiden-
tal, and was not at a ll 
tarnished with a 12·2 opening 
record (undefeated in Div. III). 
However, the Tritons' 
performance in the DI\ III 
Nationals was a different 
storv, as UC D started off 
slowlv and never reco\cred . 
The re ult was a flft h phlcP 
team finl h. Indi\ Idualh-, 
Cathy Sturdivant , ranked 
second in the nation most of 
the 'eason, made Il to the 
quarterfInals in singles

ousted. She also teamed \\'Ith

the semifinab In doubles; both 
partners earned All·Ameri ca n

Another big season 
for Hollywood 

By CLYOENE NEE 
Summer films usually represent some of the best 

and worst entertainment that the movie sttldios 
produce. This summer. movies will be much like those 
in the past. with a mixture of splashy science fiction. 
infantile adolescents going through puberty. shark 
films. and car crash and bum films. 

-Some ofthe guaranteed box office hits this summer 
will be the new 007 James Bond Him OctoPU$sg. and 
of course Return of the Jedi and Supemra~lIt It -
seems that this summer more than any in the past is 
going to be the time of the sequel. Sequels have 
become a popular tool In tht\ film industry in the past 
few years to capitalize on a film's popularity. 
Moviegoers beware. there are a lot offllms that will be 
released this summer which have been designed to 
grab the big bucks and run. 
P5ycho" - Unlike many of the other sequels that 
will be coming out this summer Psycho lIis a perfect 
compliment to the original film. 

Norman Bates. portrayed by Anthony Perkins. has 
frightened millions of people with the now infamous 
shower scene in the first fi 1m Psycho over twenty-two 
years ago. Many people to th is day refuse to take 
showers after seeing this scene; one woman 
reportedly hasn't been in the shower for over twenty 
years. 

In Psycho II it is over twenty-two years later. and 
Norman Bates is being released from an institution for 
the criminally insane. He returns to the new run down 
Bates Motel. and strange things begin to happen. Is 
Norman slipping back into insanity. or perhaps is 
there a darker evil force at work? 

The ending will surprise you. Definitely a film to see 
this summer. 
Wargame5 - What happens when a teenage 
computer wiz accidentally stumbles on the access 
code to the NORAD computer controlling our nuclear 
weapon arsenal? It means long lines at the box office 
for this film. This is probably the best film of the 
summer. 

If you are a computer programmer. or have friends 
who are computer programmers, you will like this 
film. Though the government maintains that this 
could not happen. it is a fun film .

San Diego headed for 
great theater season 

By JOArf fORSBERG 
A galaxy of stars will shine over Southern california 

this summer. Not celestial bodies. but terrestrial 
stars. 

Marsha Mason, David Odgen Stiers. Anthony Zerbe. 
Ray Walston and Amanda Plummer join the array of 
Broadway. film and television performers who are 
packing their bags and heading to San Diego for sun 
and surf and a little practice of their art, too. local 
theaters are vigorously rehearsing their sizzling 
season of blockbuster shows. 

••• 

The Old Globe Theatre 's festiual '83 features six 
international classics In repertory at the three·theatre 
Simon Edison Centre complex in Balboa Park. 
Performing June 9-September 18. Mason. Stiers. and 
Zerbe join a company of 27 professional and 11 non-
professional actors and actresses, whose names read 
like a "Who's Who in Show Bu iness."

Few major concerts 
expected f~r sum~er 

Although it doesn 1 look like there will .by any 
major concerts in San Diego this summer, the 
situation will hopefully change ovH the neXt ~ouple 
of weeks. In the meantime. there will be some good 
shows playing around town. .. 

After spending several years as the ' backing 
vocalist for Eric Clapton. Bonnie Bramlett is 
starting to build a career on her own. Her voice is 
reminiscent of Stevie Nicks, the only difference being 
that Bramlett can really sing instead of squealing like 
Nicks. She will appear at the Belly Up Tavern tonight 
at 9 pm. 

As one of the major female vocalists in the 1970s. 
Joni l"IitcbeU opened the door for many other 
women who entered the solo singing field. Tonight 
she will perform at the Civic Theater downtown. for 
further ticket information. call 236-6510. 

Billy Vera has been around for a while, but hiS 
music and performances remain very fresh and alive. 
His band won Billboards #1 Award as Most Promising 
New Artist of the Year. This ummer, Billy and the 
Beaters will be touring various c1u :, in california. His 
San Diego performance is scheduled for June 15th at 
the Belly Up Tavern. 

Everyone get ready to do the Rock. lobster this 
summer because the 8-52'5 are comig to town. As 
the ultimate beach party music group ofthe 80s, they 
have gained a mass following in the southern 
california area. This Is one of the hottest concerts of 
the summer, and the best value for your concert 
dollar. They are one of the better live bands that tour 
today and they will play at the Open Air Theater at 
SDSU on June 18th. 

Just in case you missed the US festival and didn't 
get to see A flock of Seagulls but were thinking that 
you would see them when they came to San Diego 
this summer. don't bother. They put on the worst live 
performance at the US festival , and it is obvious that 
they must do a lot of studio work to get the sharp 
sound that they have on their albums. If you like the 
way they sound, you would better spend your time 
watching their hit single I Ran on MTV. 

for you jazz tusJOn ran~, lI1ere are two fantastic 
groups coming to town dt the end of this month : Tbe 
Lee Ritenour Band and Spyro Gyra. The lee

'n pop music there Is a 
tendency to group the funk 
music genre within the realm of 
di co music. Despite the 
c,u(cess of bands such as ABC in 
integrating d dance-or.Jcnted 
format to their music. funk has 
yet to gain a position of respect 
with the music listening public. 
funk hd~ gained two positions 
in this respect. On one hand. 
dance-oriented music is the 
height of the trends in newer 
music and on the other hand 
nearly all funky music tends to 
be looked at as . ·that disco

The latter attitude shows a 

good deal of ignorance on the 
part of the American public in 
that they are unwilling to make 
themselves knowledgable about 
music before they criticize it. 
Even with the addition of a new 
music station in San Diego there 
is still a reluctance to be 
progessive and experimental 
with one's musical repertoire. 

Unlike other veins of pop 
music, it is hard for some to 
view funk as being In a separate 
realm from disco music. This 
shortsightedness is for the most 
part related to the association 
that people draw between 
ethnic forms of music. funk is a 
black genre of music, but it is 
most definitely not disco, 

h~ar a number of differ~nt ones. 
I'm not into that at this point 
because it seems too 
schizophrenic." 

This diversity of sound 
proved to be quite a detriment 
to the career of Some 
Ambulants, " It was our greatest 
weakness," f'onch says. " No one

kide from the importance 
that d label holds in making a 
band a cohesive unit. it also 
makes the bands potential 
success an accessible goal. 
fonch elaborates, "If you send a 
demo around to record 
companies and it's a little of 
this and a little of that they toss

really find a use for that kind of

Andrew Fonch and Michael 
McClure, formerly of the band 
Some Ambulants, have begun 
work on a band whose main 
focus is funk music. For anyone 
who is familiar with the music of 
Some Ambulants it should 
come as quite a surprise that 
And and And (Fonch and 
McClure 's new band) would have 
a strong funk sound. . 

Andrew ronch and JIIichael JI'IcClure are the creative force behind tbe new funk band And and And. producing a four to five !)ong EP 
that will be released late in July. 
They hope that it will create 
enough of a response so they 
will be able to follow it with 
another bit of vinyl. Primarily 
the focus of And and And is to 
approach funk from their own 
perspectives in order to make it 
more accessible to people who 
do not necessarily like funk 
music. As Fonch says. " I want 
people to listen to our musIC' 
and smile.' 

Originally Some Ambulants' 
sound was quite diverse. 
According to Fonch this was a 
definite downfall to the band's 
success and eventually led to its 
being dissolved. 

could latch onto our sound. 
There was no real focus. People 
would come up to us after a 
show and tell us that we never 
sounded the same twice. There 
wasn't really a Some Ambulants 
sound." 

At this point in time both 
Fonch and McClure are working 
on a recording project where 
they are composing. arranging 

alot of sense, There has to be a 
solidarity of direction. There has 
to be a unfied sound moving in a 
distinct pattern." 

Stylistically And and And 
make it clear that they have 
found a niche in funk music but 
are not really a traditional funk 
band. " We don't have a real 
black funk sound basically 
because we aren·t black 

will be a hybrid between other 
styles of music. We have a song 
where Andrew does a rap and it 
is very obvious that he is 
English. We're approaching it 
from a different angle." 

Many bands in recent times 
ha ve gained popularity by 
reviving a particular genre and 
integrating a style such as 
rockabilly. Similarly And and 

"There were basically three 
writers in Some Ambulants. two 
of which were Michael and 
myself. I wanted Some 
Ambutants to move in this 
direttiol1 (towards funk) but it 
just wa~n't th e right 
machinery. "

McClure also note!) that SOme 

Ambulants was not geared to a 
funkier sound. '" didn't want 
Some Ambulan ts to do th is kind 
of music. It applies to what 
George Duke said about jazz: '1

Friday night at Mandeville 
Auditorium, the eighth Annual 
Faculty/Student Dance Concert 
opened with a traditional ballet 
piece, Students and UCSD dance 
instructors combined their 
talents to produce the evening's 
exciting dance numbers, 

In Tribute ballerinas in violet 
danced across the stage on 
point. displaying pique tums 
and nice arm movements. 

Staying Power with seven 
male dancers, enttced the 
audienu. George Ben Teroy 
mesmerized many with hJs eye-
contact and excellent execution 
of leaps and pirouettes. 

A new comer this year. Dennis 
Filer added flair in the 
humorous piece, Cool Cats. 
Performers recieved alot of 
laughter from the enthusiastic 
audience. 

Burning up danced to the 
song "Man Hunt. " _with partners 
in flashy-red and black 
costumes was stunning. but 
performers were out of sync 
which detracted from the 
presentation. 

Shore Leave which opened 
the second Act, choreographed 
by student James Rex. was a 
delight. Allyn Shimade, in a 
slinky-red dress captured the 
eyes of three sailor dancers. The

'Wargames' turns out 
to be just another ... 

By (MOlL 
Why have you stopped 

playing tic-tac-toe? 
Could it be that you have 

matured intellectually and 
emotionally beyond simple 
battles of X's and O·s. and 
playing games of good guys 
against bad guys? Have you 
realized these mindless war-like 
games require only automatic 
reactions to the opponent's 
attacks? Is it obvious to you 
that no matter where you make 
your first attacki ng move. the 
final outcome is always the 
same. Nobody wins, 

When David interfaces with 
WOPR again he asks: 

" What is the primary goal of 
your program?" 

"To win the game," (global 
thermal nuclear war) 

"Is this a game or is it real?" 
" What is the difference?" 
Is Watyamesjust a movie. or 

is it based on reality? 

..J 

---

last year they did use computers 
to produce visual displays 
similar to the ones seen in 
Watyames. 
Canole: " Do you think 
Wargames will heighten 
people 's awareness of nuclear 
arms issues?" 
York: " Wargames works in a 
way very different from the 
usual movie which describes z 
post-nuclear situation. 

Perhaps because of its two 
hour restriction, the movie 
presents some ideas too 
simplistically. But on the 
otherhand some of the thinking 
at NORAD is too simplistic. like 
taking the President and the 
human factor out of the nuclear 
launch loop. 

The creators of the movie 
Watyames hope audiences will 
realize the answers to these 
questions of why we do not play 
tlc-tac-toe also explain why'\ve 
should not consider playing 
"Global Thermal Nuclear War", 

Dr, Herbert York (former 
director of Livermore Labs. 
Assistant Secretary of Defense. 
Ambassador to the Comprehen-
sive Test Ban Talks. and present 
Director of The Institute on 
Global Conflict and Coopera-
tion) granted an interview after 
a .screening of Watyames. 
Canole: "Does the NORA!? 
defertse system ever simulate a 
nuclear launch like the opening 
scene of WatyameS? " 

Beringer and I"IcKitbick discuss a system malfunction in Watyames. 

As an allegory it is very good. 
The message presented on 

the nuclear arms race was just 
right. 

Watyames starts out as a 
simple adolescent story of a 
computer wiz kid meets valley 
girl. Matthew Broderick as David 
and Ally Sheedy as Jennifer 
convincingly portiay the naive 
and apathetic attitude of 
today's youth towards events of 
the world, But one afternoon 
their .::amputer pranks accessed 
them into NORAD's nuclear 
launching computer WOPR. 
setting off a nucler alert. When 
they realize how close their 
careless actions came to 
causing a nuclear war, they 
become awakened to how 
limited and fragile our lives are 
in today's nuclear age. 

York: "The idea in the movie 
was that they were somehow 
testing the efficiency of the 
human factor in the nuclear 
launch loop by tuming on the 
missiles. 

NORAD would never do this. 
The reason is that there is a need 
for super extreme caution when 
dealing with nuclear missiles. 

The whole system is built to 
avoid an unauthorized launch. 
And that includes constructing 
the facility so that the two 
people turning the keys cannot 
be in touch with eachother. One 
of them could not point a gun 
on the other like in the movie. 
That would negate the whole 

system. 
Hut this also creates a 

problem in the NORAD system 
because you cannot test it. To 
test it, you would have to 
remove all the warheads from 
the missiles, otherwise there 
would be the fear that we might 
accidentally send a full armed 
missile on its way to a Russian 
target." 
canole: " What is the possibility 
of NORAD removing the human 
factor and converting to a 
computer launch system?" 
York: "The question as to 
whether nuclear missiles should 
be automatically la unched or 
not is a real issue. The idea has 
persistently occured during our 
nuclear arms history. 

It was actually at the 
Cheyenne Mountain NORAD 

Installation in 1960 when I had 
an argument. similar to the one 
in Wargames. with the general 
commander of NORAD. The 
general wanted to improve the 
BMEWS radar system so that we 
could get to the point where the 
computers fired the missiles. He 
didn't want anyone, not even the 
President. to be in on the 
decision to launch. because it 
would make the system 
unreliable. 

[ said. " General we are never 
going to fire missiles 
automatically. " 

Then he said, "Well, we might 
as well surrender now." 

In the real world. the 
computer does not have 
anything remotely approaching 
authority and judgement. But 
when I was at the NORAD system 

The only way to win. is not to 
play." 

••• 

At one point in Wargames, 
when a nuclear war seems 
eminent. someone tells the 
general commander of NORAD 
to stop acting like a 
preprogrammed machine. 

Like the general and his 
wargames, the officials 
responsible for the nuclear arms 
race are treating it like some 
sort of game that can be won. 
The lesson of Wargames is that 
we need to remove our 
obsession of automatically 
matching missile for missile. 
We need to replace the human 
factor of caring for the millions 
of lives involved. Then we can 
untie the vicious nuclear launch 
loop which threatens to strangle 
the life out of our future.

Hiatus foreign Correspon: 
dent Mike Ahn was sent to the 
small town of Devore, 
California ovef Memorial Day 
weekend to see what all the 
fuss was about. Below are his 
notes on the madness and 
mediocrity of us ·8J. from his 
hospital bed, Ahn reports, "A 
good time was had by all. " 

Heavy Metal Day saw the 
largest crowd and the most 
violence of the four days of US. 
Atcording to San Bernardino 
Sheriff floyd Tidwell. rock 
throwinH " melees" erupted 
between crowds of frustrated 
heavy metal fans trying to leave 
the festival on Sunday night. 

Buses leaving the concert 
were shelled with various debris 
including rocks and beer 
bottles. Many were stranded 
because of the large crowds and 

a shortage of buses. Perimeter 
fences were knocked down by 
people trying to get out of the 
pa rk. 

An estimated .300,000 people 
turned out to hear the likes of 
Judas Priest and Van Halen play 
on Sunday. Sheriff Tidwell. a 
portly. good humored man with 
a penchant for silver and 
turquoise jewelry, likened the 
event to "a mess and a zoo," 
Tidwell added that he doesn't 
.. see any peace and love about 
it." Especially irritating to the 
sheriff was the performance of 
Van Halen. who he claimed was 
whipping the audience into a 
cop-hating frenzy. 

Says Tidwell. "Van Halen can 
stay out of here. We don't want 
him in our county. He was 

saying to the croWd .. Let's show 
the cops what violence is, what 
fun is,' There's no need for 
getting the crowd excited like 
that. He was screaming 
vulgarities over the mike. 
There's no call for that,'· 

Two incidents of violence 
occured on Heavy Metal Day. 
The first was when James Estel. 
33. of Pomona, was beaten to 
death by James Stanton, age 22. 
The incident happened at 3:30 
am on Monday morning. Estel 
apparently was involved in a 
dispute over an illicit drug deal 
with Stanton. Stanton allegedly 
beat Estel to death with a tire 
iron. 

The crowd was so thick for 
Heavy Metal Day that three 
people had their arms broken by 
the force of bodies squeezing 
against the stage. Two people 
had their ribs broken by the 
same effect. 

Sheriff Tidwell has no reports 
of babies being born during US. 
but interjected that "I'll bet 
plenty of 'em were made," 

A favorite item of the crowd 
were spray bottles filled with 
water used to keep each other 
cool in the 80 degree heat. One 
observer remarked that the 
spraying of each other with 
water was like "a mating ritual ," 
Another US goer exclaimed that 
she was being "squirted in a 
stra tegic area of my body," 

A security force of 2,000 
people including sheriff' s 
deputies, tI ighway Patrolmen, 
and private security were on 
hand for US '83. Peace was kept 
with hel icopters, mounted 
horse patrol. foot patrols. and 
golf carts. No security personnel 
were injured duri':lg the event. 
but one horse was shaken when 
it was hit by a bus. 

Over 125 arrests were made 
by Monday, a low figure 
considering the size of the 
attendance. Most of the felony 
arrests were made on sellers of 
bootleg merchandise. A bootleg 
shirt was selling for $3 outside 
the gate. Inside, an official US 
Fest shirt retailed for $11 
(including tax). 

A live satellite linkup was 
made to Moscow showing Soviet 
youths what rock and roll 
detente is all about. A Soviet 
jazz group called Arsenal played 
to US Fest fans via a huge 
Diamondvision T.V. screen 
erected above the stage. The 
Soviets saw Men At Work play. 
When the announcement of the 
linkup was made to the studio 
audience in Moscow. they 
responded by clapping and 
cheering. When the same 

announcement was made to the 
American audience. they booed. 

Joints were going for three 
for $5 at US. Having never 
smoked marijuana. I have no 
idea if it was good stuff. 

The press came from as far 
away as Japan and Toronto to 
cover US. By the third day there 

was much anger among the 
photographers, who were rarely 
allowed access to the photo pit 
in front of the stage. One news 
photographer tried to arrange a 
symbolic protest that had all 
photographers with their backs 
turned against the festival. and 
their cameras on the ground. 
They would then take turns 
taking pictures of themselves. 
No one showed up. 

The air was thick with dust 
and smog all Memorial Day 
weekend. Those of the press and 
organizers who had to be there 
for all three days resorted to 
wearing masks and scarve~ over 
their mouths. 

The last show, David Bowie. 
ended at 2 am Tuesday morni ng. 
Many people spent up to one 
and a half hours walkin~ back to 

their car5. Somt people wert 
walking along a railroad trac~ 
when a train cam-; through, 
sending hundred.. jum p ing 
down a teep embankment in 
pitch darkness. No one was hurt. 

fhe Clash , w ho we re 
headlining Saturday's show. 
called a press conference before 
they were to go on stage to play. 
They announced that US was a 
total "moneymaking venture " 
and they had asked Wozniak to 
donate ten percent of the 
expected $18 million grossed to 
a california charity. Wozniak 
agreed to donate $35.000 to a 
boy's camp in the name of the 
Clash. The Clash felt that paying 
$25 to come to US to eat 
" Wozburgers and Wozdogs and 
go to Wozland" did little for the 
poor of Ca lifornia. and that the 
spirit of US was a sham. Dr. El lis 
ca lled the Clash's attempt to 
gain money for chari ty as . pure 
extortion," 

Actually. Wozniak expects to 
lose $10 million on US '8.3. Al l of 
those involved seriously doubt 
that there will be an US '84 
unless they can find someone 
rich or crazy enough to bankroll 
it.

• BASEBALL 
After the glory and hoop-I a 

of a trip to China in December, 
Skipper Lyle Yates and the 
basebasll team suffered 
through a tough season where 
just about everything went 
wrong a long the way through 
a 9-30 campaign.. Numerous 
injuries crippled the team at 
the outset. Repeated rainouts 
bored them early. Stolen 
equipment demora lized them 
half way through . It wasn 't 
u nti l the end of the year that 
the squad began to put it 
together. They regrouped in 
time to make the playoffs but 
lost in the first round. The 
Tritons were led by All -
Everything Mike Brown. Un~il 
he became ineligible, that IS. 
Freshman Scott "Scooter" 
Melendrez was superb for the 
c lub wit h a .320 batting 
average. David Jankowski 
played wizard third base and 
UCLA transfer Joe Wolf 
pounded ot a big impression in 
the late going, but by then, the 
season was put Lo rest.

• MEN'S BASKETBALL 

Perhaps the story of UCSD 
sports in 1983 was high 
expectations with nOL·so-high 
resu lts. This was never more 
evident t han in the men's 
basketball season . Before the 
quad had even picked up a 

basketball , Head C03ch John 
Block a nd Assista nt Tom 
Marsha ll were saying that the 
'82-'83 Tritons would not only 
cha llengt: Westmont for the

league title , but have an 
excellent opportunity to 
advance to Kan as city as the 
NAIA District III representa-
tive. The resul ts were far from 
the lofty goals . UCSD 
accumulated a meager 13·]3 
record through the season, and 
was eliminated innocently 
enough in t he fir t round of t he 
playoffs by Asuza Pacific. 
HOwever, one cannot say that 
Block and Mars hall were 
unjustified in making their 
predictions, because the 
Tritons were capable - at 
times - of playing quintes· 
sent ial basketball. One on Iy 
needs to look back to the Feb, 
20 double overtime 64-60 
v ictory against previously 
unbeaten Westmont. Unfor-
tunate l y, those kind of 
performances were few and 
far too infrequent. Losing Bob 
Goodman and Mike Maross to 
graduation will hurt, but

F li nt s hou ld beable Lo step into 
t heir ' hoes adequate ly. Even 
though t he season e.nded 
quickly for Block and fnends 
in '83, no one can say that the 
brand of basketball played 
duri ng the past two years has 
been anything but exciting, 
Excitement a nd a few more 
wins s hou ld come aplenty next 
season.

• WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
The Lady Tritons had what 

you would call a banner year in 
1983. With an explosive fast 
break offense and a good 
defense, the Tritons enjoyed 
the best year in UCSD 
women's basketball his tory by 
finishing with an impressive 
17·9 record. Incredibly, four 
players finished the ea on 
with a scoring a verge in double 
figures : Paulette Parker, Teik 
Francis, Brenda Sweatt, and 
Julie Krau se. Francis was the 
key at center a Coach Judy 
Malone's offense revolved 
around her. Franci s led the 
Tritons in rebounding with a 
10.6 per game average. 
Jennifer Gregory fini s hed 
second in that category with a 
10.1 mark . Freshman Shelley 
McKeone also contributed well 
as the Tritons fini s hed fifth in 
the Western Regional s. 
Unfortunately, only the first 
four Leams qualified for the 
playoffs. A glorious season 
just as well . 

-Jeff Savage 
• SWIMMING 

Perhaps the best season of 
swimming at UCSD climaxed 
with top ten national finishe 
by bot h the men 's and 
women's squads. The men 's 
team, after a 5-3 dual season, 
sent a total of ten swimmers to 

the Nationals in Ohio. Eight of 
the ten returned a~ All-
Americans as Coach Bill 
Morgan led his team to a sixLh 
place showing at the Div. III 
tournament. The women 
placed one pot higher after a 
3-5 dual season which 
qualified II swimmers for the 
Nationals competitIOn. Nine 
women earned All-American 
honors as UCSD took fifth 
place . Among the -nany school 
records smashed by both the 
men and women was a 
nationa l record In the zoo f1v 
by Athlete of the Year Lee 
Morrow. Prospects for next 
season look promising as the 
Triton s exit the Miramar 
structure for the more 
accumodatlng pool at the 
UC D Rec Center. e\'eral 
returnees shou ld combine 
with recruits for a 1984 season 
to rival 1983':;,

• WOMEN ' VOLLEYBALL 

Coming off a natIOnal 
championship season in '81. 
the Tritons ' effort to repeat 
fell a bit short. but Doug 
Dannevik' troop had 
a nother sparkling season 
nonethele . By fini hing 24· 
16, UC D travelled to 
Wi con in for the Divi ion III 
playoffs with the hope of 
returning to Triton Pavilion 

Runners-Up 

for the Nationals . They 
s ucceeded. But a title game 
loss at the hand~ of laVerne 
marked a disappointing 
ending to an otherwise very 
succesful year. Tammy Smit 
set Triton records for most 
kills in a season with 407 along 
with most attempts with 968. 
Louise (Lu lu) Schwartz was 
once again a setting sensatlO.n 
and both she and mIt 
received All· America honors. 
Molly Wheatley had a flOe year 
a - well, as did Karin Kalk and 
Elaine Bergman. But in a 
cia-sic case of "total team 
effort", it took the contfl bu· 
tion of all the players to make 
the ]9 2 e~son a proud and 
memorable one.
