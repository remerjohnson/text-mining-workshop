Mary McCarthy Speaks 
On Father's Behalf 

Mary McCarthy, 19 year-old 
daughter of Senator Eugene Mc-
Carthy of Minnesota, spoke to 
UCSD students Monday on behalf 
of her father. She spoke of the 
senator's attempts to initiate a 
new type of politics in this coun-
try symbolized by information, 
openness, and honesty. 

McCarthy's domestic policy 
includes guaranteed jobs and 
minimum incomes for every 
American. By improving govern-
ment efforts in such areas as 
housing and education, in addition 
to the above, he hopes to be able 
to fulfill the promises that have 
been made in the past. 

Muir Sene tors 
Choseni Revelle 
Res ultsC ontes tecl 

Revelle students must return 
to the polls today to vote for their 
three senators-at-Iarge. Muir 
students chose Steve Greenberg, 
Jon Colllns and steve Ishmael on 
Wednesday, but must vote today 
for president and vice-president. 

Tom Baer and Tom Peiffer 
won the Upper- and Lower-Divis-
ion senate spots with wide mar-
gins over their opponents. Gary 
Curtis' write-in campaign faUed 
to upset Baer. 

The official results are as fol-
lows: 

For Upper-Division Senator: 
Tom Baer 349 

Miss McCarthy said that her 
father feels that a total re-
evaluation of US foreign policy 
is necessary. Specifically the 
senator has said that the NATO 
treaty is outdated. He believes 
that the pOlitics of force and 
distrust must be replaced by 
cooperation and trust. McCarthy 
would continue to fulfill US re-
sponsibilities of foreign aid, but 
would eliminate the "gospel mis-
sion policy," in which "we give 
bread, and you sing our song." 

As for the draft, McCarthy 
feels that General Hershey should 
be retired, and a complete re-
vision made of the entire system. 
He is in favor of a lottery for 19 
year-olds in order to remove 
many of the inequities of lUI:: 
system. He opposes the estab-
lishment of a professional army 
on the grounds that it would es-
tabUsh a military class. 

McCarthy would also "put an 
end to the fiefdom of J. Edgar 
Hoover," not because of any per-
sonal animosity toward Hoover, 
but because he feels that no one 
man should have that much power 
for so long a period. He was also 
one of the first in the senate to 
initiate efforts to bring the CIA 
under greater governmental con-
trol. 

Miss McCarthy stated that her 
fa,ther feels that the best way to 
control crime in the streets is by 
restraint on the part olthe pOlice. 
He has said that such problems 
w1l1 exist until the conditions that 
lead people to riot are improved. 

Shepard"Mishler Vie Today 
In Presidential' Run-off 

In heavy voting last Wednes-
day, approximately 1100 Revelle 
and Muir students chose Tom 
Shepard and Trish Cunningham 
to face John Mishler and Ron 
Hetrick in the run-off today. 

Third-place Roy Verdery fol-
lowed Mishler by only 6 votes. 
Last place Michael Brown trailed 
by 69. 

Both runners-up threw their 
support to the Shepard-Cunning-
ham ticket yesterday. 

The voting booth in Revelle 
was busy from the time the 
polls opened at 9 p.m. until they 
closed at 6 p.m. Both AS voting 
boxes were stuffed to their limits 
by the end of the day. 

In Muir apparently 80 % of the 
second college's 400 voters turn-
ed out at Building 250 Matthews. 

The major feature of Wednes-
day's voting was the extent of 
ticket-splitting among the candi-
dates who ran with vice-presi-
dents. Sample checking showed 
students in Muir voting for Het-
rick or Brian Ritter along with 
Tom Shepard instead of Cunning-
ham. Since Verdery did not have 
a runningmate, most voters chose 
Cunningham, since he received 
the most votes of any candidate 
on the ballot--449. 

In comparison with last year's 
voting, when three were running 
for president and three for vice-
preSident, about five-hundred 
more students voted this time. 
There was no run-ort ~tween

shy of a tie), while Herv Sweet-
wood, who received a slim plur-
ality over Baer's running mate 
(Harold Duncan) of 10 votes, won 
the run-off by les s than 40. 

The AS office estimates that 
the total number of voters was 
about 65% of the undergraduate 
student body. "It is difficult to 
say exactly how many from each 
college voted," a reliable spoke-
sman said, "because not every-
one voted for president." 

Below are the official figures 

released by the Election Com-
missioners yesterday.

for president were counted three 
times before orrtcial figures were 
released. 

Regents Raise Re~stration Fees 
UCSD stUdents will have to 

pay $loJ6 per quarter as their 
University Registrativn Fpe 
starting next quarter in the Fall, 
the Regents decided at its Da-
vis meeting last week. 

In a general session marked 
by student outbursts and delay-
ing tactics on the part of some 
members, the Regents ended 15 
months of discuss lOll which has 
been surrounded by pol!tical 
overtones from the Governor's 
office and by emotional )Iltcries 
from the states students. 

DeWitt Higgs, chairman of the 

Committee on ~tudent Charges, 
gave his final report and an-
nounced that the $8 mil lion raised 
by the $81 increase per student 
per year would be spent for fi-
nancial aid, allocations to the 
Deans of student!; Offices, and 
better counselling services on 
each campus. 

Of the total, $3 million will 
go Cor · offset grants" to aid stu-
dents who will not be able to 
afford the increase. 

The tuition charge for out-of-
state students was raised from 
$327 to $400 per quarter at the 
same time as the Incidental Fee 
was raised.

In an exclusive interview with 
Charles Hitch, President of the 
University of California, the Tri-
ton Times learned that a suc-
cessor to Chancellor Galbraith 
is expected to be announced at 
the Regents' May me ting in 
Santa Barbara. 

Galbraith's resignation is ef-
fective July 1, 1968. He is leav-
ing for Cambridge, England todo 

res arch in British Diplomatic 
History of the 19th century on 
a Smuts Fellowship. 

The process of selecting a 
chancellor is handled by a secret 
campus faculty committee, which 
makes recommenc1ations to the 
Regents' committee. 

Hitch said he was s nxlous 
UCSD to hear ot a uccessor, 

"and I feel we will hear by 
next month." 

This amendment to th report

Gu sf Editorial 

What • IS UCSD's· Racial Attitude? 
In the Triton Times guest editorial of AprU 12, 

"Schools Cited as Root of Racism," Mwandishi 
used the word 'racist' or ' racism' a total of twelve 
times whlJe discussing AmerIcan society, culture, 
and mostly education. "Racism" covers a wide area 
of attitudes: what does it mean at UCSD? Is it a 
racism of active belief In white supremacy? Are 
there "white racists" here who deliberately com-
mit crimes against Black students? Or is "white 
racism" harder to pin down? In Mwandishi's article, 
the Revelle College catalogue is called ' racist' 
because of a sin of omission--the omission of 
courses in African and Asian cultures. The Black 
student should be able to learn about his own 
cultures: o.k. And the white man should learn 
more about 'Black' cultures, not just to broaden 
his outlook, but because "the white man has not 
bgen able to relate to people ot color in any way 
other than a racist manner:' Thus "racism" 
comes out looking like the moral and social im-
potence of the white man. 

perhaps this is the best word to describe the l1te- ' 
style of the UCSO student. We've committed no 
crime against Black people, and yet racism does 
exist "in a deep-rooted fashion" in our society ' 
and culture, if not in our conscious minds. Southern ' 
California racism is a matter of "Sins of Omission": 
Our white parents have given us a society in which 
we have had no chance to relateto"poople of color" 
at all. It was true in high schoolj now it's true at 
the t.lmous University of California. 

But the trouble isn' t just in segregation of neigh-
borhoods and schools: it gets inside. "Passive 
racism" goes beyond the tact Uat there are less 
than 1 % "people of color" at UCSDj it becomes 
evident wben you reaUze how many colorless white 
people there are on this campus. They can't even 
relate to white people: how can you expect tbem to 
to a step further and try to relate to Blacks? Their 
lives are empty of real relatiooships, filled in with 
hours of toying with science and math problems. 

courses in ASian and African cultures: they have 
no SOCiology, no Pollttcal Science, no History of 
ReUgion--all areas in which Blacks and whites 
could gain better perspective on (white) American 
SOCiety and culture. Especially if there weren't two 
years of science and math required of every stu-
dent, white and Black alike. But there's more 
emptiness in UCSO's "racist" power structure: 
no student union, no student cafe with a juke box, 
no big-name musical (white or Black) entertainment 
recruited, and no amplified student forum allowed on 
the center of the campus - Revelle Plaza. 

This can change, but it's up to the students: the 
administration is too old, too blind to see what 
real color, what true inner life of a person and a 
campus can be. Only if the white students on this 
campus come out of the dead trance they are in 
will UCSD be more than a mockery of a university. 
That's when racism at UCSD will begin to end. 

No"ne of us likes to think he 's impotent, but 
Which brings me to point two: UCSO has a 

colorless administration. Not only do they have no By Terry Bain

14etters ,to'the Editor, 
Reduction Of Racism To Racist 
Essence Unfeasible, Says Baron Soinick Calls Society II Racist" 
Editor, The Triton Times, 

It seems necessary to sort 
out Mwandishi's justified sense 
of outrace at the plight of blacks 
in this country from the spurious 
propositions woven into his guest 
editorial. We are asked to believe 
that the "essence" of our white 
population is racist, and that the 
blacks have a different essence, 
which is somehow re lated to Afri-
can or Asian life. Plainly, racism 
is wide Iy distributed among 
whites, although in varying de-
grees of intensity. Some fortu-
nates are entirely free of it. Can 
all the many and diverse at-
tributes of the white population be 
reduced to a racist essence? Is 
racism the quality in whites which 
prevails over all others? 

It is equally meaningless to 
speak of a black "essence;' ::The 
blacks have lived in this country 
for hundreds of years. Alth~ugh 
survivals of their African back-
ground ha.ve been detected byan-
thropologists, for good or ill the 
blacks have assimilated large 
doses of American culture. Afro-
Americans who visit Africa have 
found that the blacks there, rather 
than recognizing a common es-
sence, look on the visitors as 
Americans culturally. It is time 
to have done with this mystical 
a.nd baseless talk of essences, 
which is indeed one ofthe staples 
of racist ideology everywhere. 

It is time to recocnize our com-
mon hu manity, and to bend all 
our efforts toward gtvin, every 
man, irrespective of his color, 
the respect and the opportunities 
he deserves. 

Not everyone can or will be 
persuaded to this view, but it is 
more important, Mwandishi to 
the contrary notwithstanding, that 
massive proiI'ams to-end poverty 
and serre~tion be adopted. 
Blacks should strive together 
with their white friends to secure 
the implementation of programs 
for decent housin" jobs, and edu-
cation rather than worry them-
selves over the incurably preju-
diced portion of our population. 
As for education, we should have, 
and we intend to have, courses 
on African and Asla~ history, 
the Negro in America, and so 
forth. We should of course "re-
ceive a broader outlook on other 
cultures of the world," and much 
has been done to that end since 
World War n. As we learn about 
African contributions to Ameri-
can 1 ife , howeve r , we cannot 
cease to study the European back-
ground of so much of our culture. 
That culture produced noble 
ideals which we are called upon 
to fulfill as well as the pernicious 
concept of essences which M wan-
dishl has mistakenly tried to 
ressur ect.

The Tuesday the Ninth commit-
tee was formed shortly after the 
assassination otDr. Martin Luth-
er King. We are convinced of the 
racist nature of American soci-
ety. More specifically, we real-
ize every American is a racist 
by virtue of participation in a 
racist society. It is our intention 
to do everything within our power 
to arrest racism in this country. 
We realize our limited capacity 
to invoke change on a large 
scale; for this reason we are 
concentrating our efforts upon 
the La Jolla and San Diego areas. 

Because you have been ac-
cused of being a racist it is my 

obli~tion to explain. First otall, 

do not contuse the term "racist" 
witb "bigot" . A bigot is an 
active racist. It is not necessary 
to be bigoted in order to be a 
racist. All Americans are racists 
as a result of their involvement 
with the racist institutions of 
this country. Some Americans 
are racists as a result of their 
apathy--their failure to act a-
gainst racism. The only actions 
that have any Significance to the 
black people in this country are 
those which bring valuable re-
sults, not merely attending dia-
logues or reading literature. 

There is much more informa-
tion that could be given con-
cerning the Tuesday the Ninth 

Committee--our past activities, 
the names of our leaders, our 
successes and failures, etc. How- , 
ever, it is time to make a plea 
for action on the part of the stu~ 
dents of UCSD. We desperately 
need help ' in our organizationj 
you and I both know that thls 
help will not come from the 
people of La Jolla, for La Jolla 
is "a unique community in which 
all colors, races, and creeds 
have lived iri complete harmony 
for years." (The "Qnique com-
munity" of La Jolla was closed 
to Jews until five years ago). The 
help we need must come from 
the students of this campus.

Van Cleave Fears NewNudear Threat 
AccordinC to William Van 

Cleave, the problem of nuclear 
prolife ration whicb faces the U.s. 
today is not a (JIestion of bow to 
limit the membership of the nu-
clear club to its present five 
members but how to live withtbe 
many nations who will sooner or 
later possess nuclear weapons. 
Thus Mr. Van Cleave, the CUest-
in-residence lecturer from the 
University of Southern Californ-
Ia, frankly stated to a very small 
audience in the Humanities Li-
brary Auditorium his opinion of 
what should form the basis of 
U.S. policy towards nuclear pro-
liferation • 

Van Cleave is a member oflhe 
School of International Relations 
at USC and a member of the 
Strategic Studies Center, Stan-
ford Research Institute. He point-
ed out that the only way the U.S. 
could prevent nuclear prolifera-
tion would be either to destroy 
Chinese nuclear facilities in 
order to prevent Japan and india 
from developing nuclear defense 
systems, to force Japan and India 
to stop production of nuclear 
weapons--thereby riskin,the end 
of our friendly relations with 
these nations, or to promise these 

natioos to defend them in a situa-
tion which we maynotparticu-
larly like later. As these alterna-
tives are unattractive, nuclear 
proliferation should seem less 
ominous to tile U.S. 

Another fact that destroys any 
realistic hope of non-prolifera-
tion is that almost any nation 
with the physical resources can 
produce nucl~ar weapons. Nu-
clear technolo(y is so advanced 

' that anyone can purchase im-
portant data concerninrthe criti-
cal mass of Uranium and Pluton-
ium for $1.75 from the U.S. 
Atomic Ener&,}, Commission. 
Also, nuclear weapons are ex-
tremely efficient; when one con-
siders that a mortar shell equip-
ped with a nuclear warhead pro-
vides as much destructive torce 
as two tons ot T.N.T., the ad-
vantage of nuclear weapon$ is 
quite apparent. The advantages 
of nuclear weapons has not gone 
unnoticed by countries such as 
Sweden whose army, though it 
has no nuclear weapons, is train-
in, in anticipation that it soon 
may. 

An even more ominous threat 
discussed by Mr. Van Cleave 
was the threat of non-national 

luce-Shapiro Debate 
Reaches Consensus 

The attitude of the whiteman 
must be changed before the Race 
problem in America be solved. 
This was the consensus reached 
by Phillip Luce and Barry Sha-
piro in their debate last Friday. 

Luce suggested that instead 
of telling the black people to take 
up arms, people should go into 
white communities and talk to the 
people. Shapiro was in agreement 
with tbis view though he express-
ed it in different Language. He 
said that the whites must organ-
ize and "clvLlize" themselves. 

The Humanities Library Audi-
torium overflowed, with scores 
of students standing and sitting 
in the aisles to hear the debate 
which was sponsored by the UCSD 
Young Republicans. Originally, 
Phil Luce was scheduled to give 
a lecture, but a day before the 
event, Barry Shapiro, a UCSD 

grad student took up tbe offer, 
which no one accepted a year 
ago, to debate Luce. 

Luce began by saying that there 
are legitimate grievances in the 
ghettos, but we should also be 
aware that there are organiza-
tions prepared to take advantage 
of them and foment them. There 
is a danger of a Race war, and 
there are people who want at 
least a gue rrilla war and are pre-
pared to change it to a Race 
war. It such a war occurred, 
nothing would be solved. The old 
problems would only have new 
ones to accompany them. Luce 
said that the blacks could not 
carryon a successful guerrilla 
war. 

Shapiro wondered if the United 
States would change witbout a 
revolution. The white man is not

proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
The threat of a very real "Gold-
fin,er" with his own personaUy 
made atomic bomb suddenly 
seemed very feasible. 

Tbe tact that 100 kUorrams of 
enriched U-Z35, the prime com-
ponent of nuclear weapons, has 
been unaccountably misplaced 
does nothing to allay anyone's 
fears. It is very possible that 
there could soon exist a black 
market dealing nuclear materials 
and perhaps even complete nu-
clear weapons systems. There 
exists now in the U.S. no effective 
control system that could cheek 
regularly the supply of nuclear 
material produced in the United 
States.

Performs Tonight A~S. Se.nJ ~ 

by ROler Show'.y 

The Senate laces this year wer e surprising in a number of points. 
Compared with last year, when only Revelle students were here to 
vote, this year's election is surprising in the number of candidates 
who tued for election. 

Only 11 Revelle and Muir undergrads ran for six Senate offices this 
time. Since the seats were divided equally between the two colleges, 
there was less choice than in the 1967 race. At that time 16 students 
ran for the same six offices. There was a run-off between the top 
eight, atter the election commissioner, George Kurata, finally was 
able to decide what constituted a majority. 

Another interesting side-light to this year's election is the lack of 
publlcity in not only the Senate but the presidp.ntlal races. Last year 
a fence, surrounding Argo and Blake Halls (still under construction) 
served as a convenient place to post platforms and s taple pos ters. 
Urey Hall floors 3 and 4 were available for posters as well. Thus 
there was more opportunity last year for r eaching the students. This 
year the windows in Argo and Blake hecame the most prominent spots 
for posters. Tom Shepard utilized the fourth floor by spelling out his 
and Tr~h Cunningham's names in 17 windows, while the other candidates 
made sImilar arrangements with friends in the dorms. 

The San Francisco Mime 
Troupe, the nationally notorious 
"guerrilla theater" whose home 
ground is the public parks of 
San Francisco and Berkeley, wlU 
perform its new commedla dell' 
ute satire, "Ruzzante, or The 
Veteran", at Revelle Cafeteria, 
Friday evening April 26 at 8:30 
p.m. The event is sponsored by 
the Graduate Literature Associa-
tion. 

Apparently the most helpful feature of this year's election was the Sweepstakes Winner at the U.C. Davis "Picinlc Day" Parade. 

The Mime Troupe, founded in 
1959 by its director R. G. Davis, 
toured the country In 1966 with 
its black and white minstre i show, 
"Civil Rights in a Cracker Bar-
rei", and again in 1967 with two 
commedla plays, "L' Amant MUi-
laire" and "Olive Pits". Its ap-
pearances have been greeted gen-
erally wlth enthusiasm but some-
time s by the pollce. The Troupe 
interprets its troubles with the 
law as signs that the society does 
not want to hear its message, 
expressed by Davis as follows: Triton Time's presentation of almost all the candidates' platforms in 

last week's issue. At last voters were able to read for themselves ' n p. • D a " w~at the 21 ~ople runn10g stood for. In fact, however, the absence of • len ICY

Draws "It's our society. It we don't1ike it, it's up to us to change it. It 
we can't change it, we will have 
to destroy it." "Ruzzante", 
adapted from a play by Angelo 
Beolco (16th century) points to 
the necess ity for change by show-
ing the disillusion of a soldie r 
who runs away from the front 
only to find things are as bad 
or worse at home. 

making the run-offs. This example proves that platforms do not make Th d t D· ' 
the candi~ate alone. 0 U sa n 5 0 av I 5 . 

PubliCity does not guarantee candidates victory, either. John Mishler's 
and Ron Hetrick's vigorous campaign drive--from posters with their 
photographs to girls with campaign slogans-- kept their names before 
the student body long before the other candidates had announced their 
intentions to run. Roy Verdery's strong showing proves that a reputation 
can be just as important as the amount of paper and paints political 
hopefu Is use. 

Today's run-ofts will tell us what voters think the second time 
around about the candidates. The lesson to be learned so far for 
future candidates is this: one must decide bow well-known he is and 
how extensive written llterature should be at the beginning of his 
campaign. 

PoliticalOpportununities 
Explained to Students 

An "Opportunities Unlimited" 
studp.nt conference was held at 
UCLA last Saturday. Students 
from campuses throughout the 
state took advantage of this con-
ference to meet and talk to sever-
al business and political leader s . 

The conference was sponsored 
by the Republican P;lrty, but was 
open to any ~tudent regardless of 
pOlitical affiliation. It is designed 
to expose students to opportuni-
ties in politics. The idea ,behind 
the conference was explained b'y 
Senator Percy, "I would rather 
people be involved in the op-
pos ing party than not be involved 
at all." 

In the morning session, Sena-
tor Percy delivered the keynote 
address. He approved or re-
sponsible student dissent ami said 
that it has had dp.finite effect on 
government policies. He also 
spoke of the desire of people to 
be humanitarian and to help their 
fellow man. But often, he said, we 
do it the wrong way. Involvement 
and ideas are needed. 

That afternoon the assembly 
broke up into three seminar 
groups to speak to panels or ex-
perts in four respective Clelds: 
communications, govp.rnment and 
politics, business, the profes-
sions and social service. 

Questions of both individual 
and social importanr.e were dis-
cussed. For ell.-ample, a r epre-

.' sentative of Lockheed said that 
businesses nad discovered it to 
be advantageous to aid and train I 
people in depressed areas for 
two reasons: it creates a larger 
trainoo work force and it expands 
market opportunities by enabling 
these people to ear n higher wages 
afjd, consequently having more 
money to spend. 

Later in the afternoon the 
groups reassembled and' heard 
Congres s man Gerald Ford give 
the closing address. H9 pushed 
the Republican party as the party 
of new ideas and opportunity. 
The Democrats, he said, are 
still bound to the old hierarchy 
and still using discredited "New 
Deal" ideas. 

One camil' ls of the UC sys-
tem has a tradition that attracts 
up ttl "i,{ i::m~ lile number ot 
people that live in its commun-
ity to It each year. 

The Davis Campus' s "Piclll .~ 
Day" of last weekend brought 
lip 10 80,000 visitors for a day 
of parades , exhibits, and enter-
tainment. Aspecial AS committee 
organizes the event lor a w1J\l1.e 
year and spends $10,000 of AS 
fees to please parent'i '\'1.1 "hon-
ond gue')ts·. Among the hon-
ored guests present wer p. UCSD's 
Suze, an outgolng Senator-at-
Large, and Cindy Nie lsen, AS 
Secretary. 

Going through all the motions 
that Davis' "Aggie" students do, 
Suze and Cindy worked on the . 
Young Republicans' and Kai Phi 
fraternitles' floats They watched 
the hOllr long parade 00 Satur-
day morning, which even at-
tracted two-score Berkeley stu-
dents , who staged a sitdown in 
front of the grand stand. 

They picnicked on the spac:lous 
lawn in front of the $3 III l110n 
Memorial Student Union, and they . 
partied, of course.

began with a weIner roast and 
grew to the full-fledged affait 
it now is . Since the campus 
was originally a center for agri-
cultural r esearCh, much of the 
days activities centered around 
the latest projects in the School 
of Agriculture. 

Among the more exotic pro 
jects underway is one that mea-
sures the elCects of radIoactivity 
in dogs. In a special kennel the 
twenty-seventh generation is al-
ready breeding.

. One interesting side light to 
Suze's and Cindy's trip was 
a vi,>it to Davis' own Coffee 
House. In an old Victorian man-
s ion, once a student dormitory, 
the AS-run center offers much the 
same fare that UCSO's Corree 
Hut provides. One addition. how-
ever, is a pickle barrel with 
kosher piCkles. The only hang-
up at Davis Is the finance'): it 
loses $100 per week and sells 
its coffee for ten cents ~ r Cll!). 

Commedia dell 'arte (Italian 
popular comedy) is a styUzed 
form of broad comedy, much of 
it often improvised, originated 
by roving players of the Renais-
sance. Performed on a portable 
stage, bare except for a back-
drop, with the actors doubling as 
stage-hands and musicians, it is 
theatre stripped to its essentials: 
clearly suitable to the aims of a 
company which, in Davis' words 
"wants to have the same relation 
to its audiences as the guerrUla 
does to the communttywhichalds 
him in his struggle". The Mime 
Troupe has performed its com-
medies, which are usually free 
adaptations of classic comedies, 
each summer since 1962 in pub-
Uc parks, supporting itself from 
the collections taken after per-
formances . The acquisition of a 
national and international reputa-
tion has not changed the Troupe's 
conviction that its real work is 
in the parks, "breaking dow n the 
walls that separate art from 
life."

trol. 

Dr. Doolittle opened his lecture 
with a few preliminary remarks 
about his campaign for Congress 
in ou r district. He cited the past 
voting record of Congressman 
ott with regards to Social Secur-
ity and the National Parks Sys-
tem. It seems that our Represen-
tative in Congress is opposed to 

both of these and also feels that 
the Postal System should be turn-

Mr. ott is a Republican. The 
35th Congressional District in-
cludes great parts of Orange

publican politics. 

Following that, Dr. Doolittle 
spoke about the grave problems

At UCSD such decisions are

for raising the fees was given 
as follows:

artist in love with their art and

With this new, more lenient, 
visitation policy will come strict-

Both the Brahms and the Haydn

and gaiety of the Haydn were 
superbly captured. The attacks,

Only the Mozar t fell below the 
rest or the program in quality. 
There was a basic discontinuity 
between the plano and the or-
cbestra that permeated the entire 
piece. The two factions wer e

chet interpreted Mozart a bit 
more tragically than necessary. 
She took a Uttle two much Uberty

Produced successfully in Enr-

AS "eh?" begins, an indolent 
youth is interviewed for a boUer 
room job by a pompous factory 
manager. Failing to com municate 
on all levels , the two men become 
intense enemies. 

The young man's individualist-
ic spirit appears compromised 
when he becomes supervisor of

experience is not an obstacle. 
The boiler room is completely 
automatic. 

Highiy s tyled farce and zany 
comedy combine as the modern 
man rebels apinst automation in 
his determination to be a free 
soul. Frustration, bewilderment

Crewmen Enter 
Coast Regatta 

Ten west coast colleges will 
compete in the eighth annual West 
Coast Invitational Rowing Regat-
ta on May 4 in MissionBay Park. 
The Bay wUl be setting for high 
speed sprints and other fowitlg 
events starring crews from UC 
at Irvine, UC at Santa Barbara, 
UC at San Diego, Orange 'Coast 
College, Cal state at Long Beach, 
Stanford, USC, ' Loyola Univer-
sity, Santa Clara University and 
San Diego state College. Two 
special events will feature a 
sprint between young women's 
crews from Zlac. pioneer local 
women's rowing clubj and an 
event between mixed men's and 
women's crews also utilizing 
Zlac members. 

Mission Bay closed to all other 
during the full schedule of rowing 
events on May 4. The publlc may 
use the viewing area on Santa 
Clara Point where amplified 
commentary by Lute Mason may 
be heard. 

The growth of interest and 
participation in rowing has shown 
dramatic increase in recent 
years, especially on the West 
Coast. In 1961 only four colleges 
could provide crews to compete 
in the annual West Coast Invlta-
tlonal--in May. ten colleges with 
highly trained and competent 
crews will compete. A spokes-
man pointed out that competition 
is largely limited to college age 
youth since the sport demands 
a peak of physical stamina and 
training. Olympic try-outs will 
be held at Long Beach this sum-
mer, and the Western Sprints 
Involving twenty-three colleges 
wUl be held In San Diego in 
May, 1969, as a special event ' 
for the Two-Hundredth Anniver-
sary celebration.

by Dave Stearns 
Triton Times Sport~ Ed~tor 

Monday. April 29 Is the day for the UCSD Department of Physical 
Education. Spring practice starts for the ftrst time, and In a sense 
represents the ruUillment of the intercolleg1ate program on campus. 

A school Is generally thought to come of age (as tar as sports are 
coocerned) when It finally fields an intercollegiate tackle team. With 
representative squads in most other sports, UCSD will bopefuUy 
push now to upgrade the scheduling and develop a top-flight athletic 
complex. 

And speaking of complexes, bets are now being taken on the date 
of completion for the gymnasium. (Let's hope It's ready by the sched-
uled May 15 opening; there's supposed to be a dance In It the 17th!). 
Progress Is being made, but people say the same thing about the 
Vietnam war. 

Again football, you say? Tomorrow night Is the annual Red-Black 
Game for the San Diego State Aztecs, the number 1 small college 
team In the nation last year. losing only 1 game to Utah State the last 
night of the season. The Saturday night atrm ts an intersquad battle 
that puts next seasons prospects on public display. Aztec Bowl is the 
place, and pme time is 8:00. 

San Diego has always ranked high in national tennis, and UCSD is 
not taking a backseat to anyone. The squad has compiled a terrUic 
season so far, and Coach Neale Stoner Hgures that the team ought to 
he good for the independent college championship at the NAIA reglonals 
in the middle of May. 

The intercolleg1ate soccer team Is hot at It on the practice field 
most nights. Time to get In shape for their initial season next tall. 
H anybody hears about top players, they might drop a line into the 
sports department and give us the word. 

And s~cer Is run! The English play it all the time. and ask what 
this country as doing to their national pastime. Of course, we could 
point to cricket, and ask the same, but that is neither here nor there. 
But anyway, enough of this B.S. Get down to Balboa Stadium some 
Wednesday night or Sunday afternoon and watch the San Diego Toros 
Professional Soccer team. You might even get so enthusiastic about 
the whole thing that you'll want to start a Booster club for the school 
team next year. 

And Baseball! UCSD does have an intercollegiate team and they 
have but two games left thls season. Coach stowe has done ~ admlre-
able job this first season in a sport that is notorious for iack of pub-
lic support. So support, and while you are at it, take a run out to the 
stadium and catch the Padres. San Diego may have a big-league team 
In '69, and that means that the AAA Padres wlll bite the dust. Forward 
to bigger and better things. 

H you have a notice of interest, or just a gripe about tbe athletic 
situation (or lack of it) on campus let the paper know. Also, I now 
state a plea for dedicated people to help cover the myriad of activ-
ities that are and will be happening in sports. It is possible, contrary 
to popular (?) belief to mix athletics and intelligence. Try it. It may 
start a trend.

luce-Shapiro 
Debate 

Continued from p.3 
Willing to change because be 
doesn't feel the need for it Tt'h1le 
the black man does. He said that 
the moderate and the temperate 
wtll not suffice. The problem is 
that the black man only feels 
equal amoll( his own people. To 
solve the black man's problem, 
Shapiro said that he aiteed with 
Stokely Carmichael saying, give 
me liberty or give me death, now. 

Tritons Set Newt Records 

Shapiro said that we must over-
come a racist power structure 
which is unwilling to give up 
economic power. He advocated 
turning over the ghettos to tbe 
blacks and bringing In Immediate 
economic relief. Furtbermore. 
the white s must accept the 10 
points of the Peace and Freedom 
Party. 

Luce said that conservatives 
could suwort the 10 points and 
recognized the need for turnlni 
businesses over to tbe blacks. 
Luce was opposed to expropria-
tion of property. He argued that 
we must convince whites aDd 
white businesses that It Is in 
their interest to make changes. 

The Triton thinclads once again 
wore the laurels of victory in a 
tightly contested meet between 
UCSD, SO T&F, and Pasadena. 
With the competition in many 
events increased by the entrants 
from T &F. the Triton runners 
proceeded to surpass the ex-
pecta.tions of many and In doing 
so set two new school records. 

The meet started on the right 
foot with the Tritons winning the 
440 relay. The team of Nieren-
garten, Wolfe, McCarthy, and 
Kuhn ran an excellent race de-
spite the Injury suffered by Mc-
Carthy in the flnal few steps of 
his leg of the relay. The team 
is now reshuffling runners to get 
the maximum advantage from 
their speed and hand-of!s. The 
mile run In which Warren Kum-
ley placed second for UC was 
won by the pace-setting captain 
of the T&F team, Bill Gookin. 
Warren who usually runs a rather 
swift mile seemed to be running 
a psychological race and thus 
preparing himself for his other 
event later on. 

Tom Wolfe, scoring 17 points, 
was the spark plug of the team 
with his wins in the century, 
the furlong (220 yd), the long 
jump, and a leg of the 440 relay. 

Second In scoring power for 
the Tritons was Jerry Nieren-
garten with 10 points. Jerry 
placed second in the 120 higb 
hurdles, 440 intermediates, and, 
long jump, and ran the.first leg 
of the quarter mile relay.

Mt. Sac Relays 

The UCSD Triton Track team 
bas passed up an invitation to 
fWl at the lOth annual Mt. San 
Antonio College Relays in favor 
of the NAIA District meet May 
18th and the National Finals in 
Albuqurque, New Mexico in June. 
The money saved by not going 
to Mt. SAC will send long jumper 
Tom Wolfe and others to theNew 
Mexico meet. 

in place of the Mt. SAC Relays 
the Triton team bas chosen to 
intensify workouts for the next 
two weeks so as to be in shape 
to re-write the record books in 
in the next two invitational meets 
at Chapman College and at UC 
Riverside. In place oHhis week's 
meet the team will hold an Inter-
squad meet at Scrl~s Beach on 
Saturday. Track coach and aU I 
time mentor Rich Johnson has 
spared m. 'ucy for his charges . 
and plans l . an outstanding end 
to this best of all seasons • 

The other outstanding perfor-
mances of the day were turned in 
by Tom Gatlin and Warren Kum-
ley in the 440 yd intermediate 
hurdles and the three mUe run, 
respectively. Tom, running well 
ahead of the rest of the Held. 
eclipsed his own record set 3 
weeks earlier by 6/10 ofa second 
by turning In a winning time of 
57.9. He has vowed to break it 
again before the season ts over, 
with hopes of achieving a time 
of 56 sec. Warren Kumley, by 
placing second in the 3 mile set 
the other record of the day with 
a time of 15:53--20 seconds un-
der the previous mark held by 
teammate Jay Segal earlier this 
year. 

The closest race of the day 
came in the mile relay in which 
Mike Bea.dle, anchor man for 
Pasadena College, came from be-
hind to nip Triton runner Marc 
Rothman at the tape by less than 
1/2 incb. Both teams received 
identical clocking of 3: 30. Beadle' 
also won the 440 yd dash over 
second place Tothman, who was 
suffering from leg cramps at the 
beg1n'ning of the day. 

The other point scorers for 
the day were Steve Gadolo in the 
discus, and the trio of Jim Dent, 
Don Bright, and Bruce Burdick 
in the pole vault (who have all 
been having trouble getting of! 
the grollnd without breakinltthelr 
poles). Also Jim Nash 10 the 880 
yd run.

Still, they both saw the same 
problem. Luce said that guns 
won't change the white man and 
we must work with tbe middle 
ciass. Shapiro compared a racist 
to an alcoholic; they both must 
recognize tllelr problem before 
they can be helped.

Hitch Praises 
UC Education 

Charles J. Hitch, president of 
the University of California, 
noted today that a college gradu-
ate over his working life pays 
the State of Cal ifornia and·loc~l 
governments almost $9,000 ill ad-
ditional taxes as a result of his 
training. 

Hitch, citing a recent study, 
pointed out that the same graduate 
pays the Federal Government an 
additional $16,000, with many of 
the benefits returned to the people 
of California. 

Speaking at centennial observ-
ances on UC's Santa Barbara 
campus, Hitch noted that the col-
lege graduate, with his greater 
productivity, enhances the pro-
ductivity of others in the econ-
oxy. A new survey, he said, 
shows that almost two fifths of 
the nation's recent economic 
growth s due to the contribu-
tions of education, particularly 
higher edl lcation. 

"In C llifornia the contribution 
of the U Jiversity to the scientific 
develop ·,le:1 or :lgrlt:IIltllrp has 
been ba ,ic to the state's econom-
ic gro'NTh, and now our institu-
tions 0 ' bigher education are a 
prime ta.ctor in California's na-
tional l~adprship position in re-
search and development and in 
allied ~ ci ntifically-oriented in-
dustries," Hitch said. 

The UC pres ident dep lored that 
the non-economic advantages of 
higher education " orten come by 
a curious process to be dis-
counted. This is a gr ve mis-
fortune, and one which the mem-
bers and supporters of the na-
tion's colleges nd universities 
must constan Iy seek to prevent 
lest it lead to a disastrous mis-
calcu lation of the costs of hIgher 

education in relation to its 
values." 

Hitch pointed to a recent na-
tional survey of liberal arts gra-
duates, with the campus 5 to 15 
years behind them, which showed 
that while less than half had 
found their educations "useful," 
more than half rated them "very 
important in developing moral 
capaCities, ethical standards and 
values." 

The subject most had wished 
they had studied more was philos-
ophy. he noted. Those surveyed 
"were not the so-called idealis-
tic, callow youth but men of some 
considerable exper ience in the 
busy life of society," Hitch said. 

"Today as seldom before we 
are a nation and a world in need 
of answers, of ways to reach the 
ends we all share -- individual 
self-fulfillment, freedom and 
equality and a fair measure of 
economic well- being for all men, 
peace and goodwill in our cities 
and in the world. And it is pri-
marily to our colleges and uni-
versili~" that we must turn for the 
survey of past knowledge, the 
examination of current ideas and 
values, the search for new con-
cepts and solution which in total 
comprise the essense of human 
though today." 

The UC president concluded 
these were the benefits which 
Californians had to determine 
eithe r as "an unwarranted ex-
travagance or a sound invest-
ment, whether they are an ex-
penditure we cannot totally af-
ford or, as I firmly believe , an 
opportunity that this state and 
this nation cannot aCCord to pass 
by." 

THERE WILL BE A MEE TING 
of the Amateur Radlo Club on 
Monday, 29 April, at 7 p.m. in 
"The Shack, building 250 MC.

Proposal for 
Judicial Board 

Resident students of Revelle 
College rejected a judicial board 
proposal for the second time this 
year. The vote was 210 for, 160 
against, quite a bit short of the 
two-thirds majority required for 
passage. 

Revised plans of the Interhall 
Council in light of this are to im-
plement the separate dorm ju-
dicial boards currently provided 
for. A committee has been form-
ed to set up dorm boards for the 
remainder of the year and set 
guidelines for operation next 
year. 

Clayton Anderson said that this 
will be the last attempt to se t up 
one central judicial board, except 
in the capacity of an appeal 
board, as provided in the dorm 
constitution. 

When asked to comment on why 
the proposal has been rejected, 
he said that many felt that a cen-
tralized board would be more 
lenient. Also th re was a genu-
ine interest in setting up the 
individual dorm boardS. 

Ltte ratur distributed by op-
ponents of the plan claimed that 
the propos d constitution lacked 
certain guarantees that are in-
trinsic In any judicial system.

Cburch (across the street from
