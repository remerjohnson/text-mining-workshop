Patent 
process 
seen as 
too slow 

Hartford study 
seeks solutions 

By ELIZABETH MAYNARD 

Editor's note: The second of 
two articles on technology 
transfer. the following piece 
focuses on the problem of pat-
enting technology developed in a 
university setting as viewed by 
faculty and staff at UCS D. as 
well as reviewing some solutions 
to this problem. 

The commercial development 
of new technology and invention 
developed at UCSD is hampered 
by an overloaded UC system 
designed to facilitate their trans-
fer into U.S . industry, according 
to those at UCSD who are invol-
ved in the system. 

Researchers say the UC Pat-
ent, Trademark and Copyright 
office at Berkeley is understaffed 
and sluggish in facilitating the 
patenting and licensing of tech-
nology developed at UCSD and 
other UC campuses . 

According to an anonymou 
researcher at UCSD who has 
had experience in getting patent 
through the UC office and now 
has several pending, the problem 
is threefold. First, the Berkeley 
office is understaffed, and there-
fore ineffective. Second, the Con-
flict of Interest law in California, 
which gives universities patent 
rights to inventions developed 
by federally funded research , 
protects the university, but it 
does take longer to get tech-
nology patented and licensed . 
Third, the UC is not a patent 
developing institution. 

He says , "At the UC we are 
basic researchers. Most faculty 
are not aware of what is involved 
in the patenting and licensing 
process, and have greater ex-
pectation of the patenting 
process. " 

Charles Colgan, Senior Public 
Information Representative for 
Scripps I nstitute of Oceanog-
raphy, agreed that the Berkeley 
patenting office is slow. "UCSD 
is a leading campus in research 
and there are commonly delay 
in this complicated process . 
Often researchers who develop 
technology will leave the univer-
sityand et up private companies

V.hlcl. Colllalon - A young adult male sustai ned neck 
and leg injuries early Wednesday even ing when a car struck 
the scooter he was riding south of the Mandell Weiss Theatre. 
The accident occurred at 4:50 pm at the intersection of Torrey 
Pines Rd. and La Jolla Village Dr. when the vict im was struck 
by a late model Mercedes turn ing left onto Torrey Pines Rd. A 
police off icial at the scene said he had not yet determined 
who was at fault. The victim, who suffered a fractured leg, was 
taken to Kaiser Permanente for treatment. 

1 ,500 riders dail~ 

Parking Shuttle is 
deemed a success 

By MAUREEN SPURR 
Staff Writer 

UCSD's latest addition to 
campus conveniences, the park-
ing shuttle , has been warmly 
received by commuter students 
who park in outlying parking 
lots. 

An average of 1,200 students 
per day rode the shuttle during 
fall quarter of 1987 , when the 
shuttle was started . According to 
statistics for the winter quarter, 
the shuttle is averaging 1,500 
rides per day, up 300 from last 
quarter. 

See graph on page 3 

"I think it is a success , and 
that's obvious," said A.S . Presi-
dent Dave Marchick . "Students 
appreciate the convenience." 
Marchick also mentioned that 
the shuttle has become one of the 
most po itive things about park-
ing on campus, which is not 
always easy . 

Marchick helped accelerate 
the plans for the huttle , which 
wa intended to begin la t spring. 
With the help of Steve Relyea , 
the vice chancellor of business 
affairs, Marchick proved to the 
admini tration that the con-
struction of decentralized park-
ing created a need for a shuttle . 

The shuttle follows a 15 min-
ute loop from 7 am to midnight, 

and has four stops during the 
day and seven stops at night. 
Daytime tops include the north 
parking lots , Mandeville a nd two 
points in between. 

The shuttle changes its route 
at 6 pm to incorporate the rest of 
the campu . Alternating 15 min-
ute loops which begin at the Sun 
God , it proceed towards the 
north parking lot , stops at the 
Warren apartment complex, 
Central Library, and returns to 
the Sun God. The shuttle then 
circles the north parking lot , 
and heads toward Revelle. There 
it stops at the Undergraduate 
Library and Urey Hall before 
finally returning to the Sun God . 

"It's the most flexible ervice 
we have," aid tran portation 
coordinator Greg nee . " It was 
.implemented quickly, and it 
would be nice to see it expand ." 
Plans for expansion of the shut-
tle or its route and top are 
indefinite and will depend on the 
demand for change and tati tics 
gathered . Idea for larger bu e 
and more frequent tops may be 
con ide red in the future . 

However, mo_ t student do 
not feel that a seven to 15 minute 
wait i too long. A one tudent 
put it , "Now I canju t sit on the 
bench and study before class, 
while before I would have been 
running or walking to class."

$810,000 donated 
to library fund-

• • • raising campaign 
Over $1.6 million raised so far 

By ROBERT LEONE 
Senior Staff Writer 

Two donation s totall ing 
$810,000 were made in December 
to the UCSD Library to be used 
in acquiring and cataloging 
materials in the humanities , 
according to Special Collections 
Librarian and Library De-
velopment Officer Lynda Claas-
sen . 

The two donations - an ano-
nymous gift of $310 ,000 and a 
$500,000 donation from La Jolla 
philanthropist Florence Seely 
Riford - are part of the 
$2 ,625 ,000 UCSD Library Chal-
lenge Grant Campaign , accord-
ing to John Steinitz, UCSD 's 
director of Planned Giving. They 
will be matched with money lrom 
the U.S . Government through a 
National Endowment for the 
Humanities Challenge Grant. 

According to Claassen , under 
the terms of the grant , for every 
$3 raised by July of 1990 to 

endow the humanities collection 
of the library, the NEH will give 
an additional dollar (to a maxi-
mum of $875 ,000) to the en-
dowment. So far the Library has 
raised $1 ,642 ,000 of the 
$2,625 ,000 that the grant will 
match , said Claassen. 

The Challenge Grant , which 
UCSD applied for in 1986, and 
which lists UCSD Dean of 
Humanities Stanley Chodorow 
as the "Principle ] nvestigator," 
will reinforce UCSD's collections 
in certain areas of the humani-
ties , help maintain the quality of 
collections in other areas , and 
begin new collection to support 
new academic programs. 

According to the grant prop-
osal , "approximately 34 percent 
of the library'S collection fall 
within humanities ubjects ." 

The library has "targeted" four 
areas to spend the proceeds from 
the endowment, according to the

Scripps nets the 
wave of the future 

By KATY GARVEY 
Staff Writer 

Contrary to popular belief, 
Scripps In titute of Oceanog-
raphy (SIO) consists of more 
than a beach and an aquarium. 
SIO has long been looked upon 
by cientists and academics a 
one of the finest and most innov-
ative centers in the world for the 
research and teaching of ocean 
science . It' hard to believe that 
high powered re earch i taking 
place amid t the peaceful La 
Jolla cliffs - but with a $60 mil-
lion annual budget you can bet 
that 10 i more than just a 
chool with a view. 

10 began in 1903 when a 
group of zoologists , led by Wil-
liam Ritter of UC Berkeley, con-
ducted ummer explorations 
along the remote coa tline of 
Southern California . Later that 
arne year , a group of prominent 
an Diegan organized the 

Marine Biological Association 
of San Diego . Ellen B. Scripps 
and her brother E. W. Scripps 
formed the group in an attempt 
to persuade biologist to stay in 
Southern California , to carry out 
a hydrographic survey of the 
Pacific Ocean adjacent to the 
coast of Southern California, and 
to build and maintain a public 
museum . Ritter took the posi-
tion as director of this fledgling 
operation . 

A boathouse the the Hotel del 
Coronado served as a laboratory 
until 1905 when it was replaced 
by a small laborato ry built at La 
Jolla Cove. Increa ing research 
soon created a need for more 
space , and in 1907 E .W. Scripps 
convinced the as ociation to 
purchase 174 acres of barren La 
Jolla coastline for $1 ,000 . 

The small , remote "biological 
colony," as it was called by La 
Jolla dwellers, flouri hed , and in

Nobel Laureate Schrieffer 
fellow at Los Alamos 

Nobel Laureate Robert Schrieffer 
will become the first Public ervice 
Company of New Mexico (PNM) 
senior scientist fellow in high-
temperature uperconductivityat Los 
Alamo National Labor:.,ury, which is 
operated by the University of Califor-
nia for the Department of Energy. 

The fellowship wa established as 
part of a two-year, $570,000 grant by 
PNM to Los Alamos a nnounced in 
july. Since that time, PNM and the 
lab have esta bli hed a formal research 
program ca lled " Ad va nced Study Pro-
gram in High-Tem perature 
Superconductivity Theory." Schrieffer 
will lead the program . 

"The program will emphasize a sub-
sta ntial postdoctoral, graduate student 
and visitor program to help establish 
the theoretical base which the field of 
high-temperature superconductivity 
will need in the futu re," said Sig 
Hecker. Los Alamo director. 
"Through Professor Schrieffer we've 
already recruited other top theorists in 
the world as participants." 

Los Alamo is a sembling an inte-
grated theoretical program extending 
from microscopic mechanisms and 
macro copic phenomenology, through 
materials modeling and microtexture, 
to fabrication and device performance. 

The program will recruit applicanis 
for graduate students and postdoctoral 
candidates for year-round fellowships 
at the Los Alamos Center for Mate-
rials Science, where the advanced 
study program will be located. 

The initial program is jointly funded 
by PM's grant and the lab. Both 
institutions will be actively seeking 
other industry contributions to expand 
the program. 

Schrieffer is a 1972 obellaureate 
in physics for his co-development of 
the Bardeen-Cooper- chrieffer theory 
of su perconductivity. He is a leading 
figu re in the international condensed 

matter science community and is cur-
rently profe sor of physics a nd direc-
tor of the Tational Science Founda-
tion Inst it ute for Theoretical Ph ysics 
a t the Un iversi ty of California at 
Santa Barbara .

Institute of the Americas 
presents lecture by Kuczyncki 

The Institute of the Americas will be 
presenting "The Stock Market, the 
Dollar Crisis," and "The Latin Ameri-
can Debt: Where Do We Go From 
Here?" Pedro-Pablo Kuczynski, Co-
chairman, First Boston International 
and Managing Director, The First 
Boston Corporation will be speaking 
on the turmoil in international finance 
that is threatening world economic 
progress. 

The stock market crash of Oct. 19 
has shaken the confidence of investors . 
So has the dramatic drop of the U.S. 
dollar. On top of these major events 
hangs the enormous Latin American 
debt. It has finally been recognized 
that the debt ca nnot be entirely repaid, 
and under current ci rcumstances it will 
be impossible to meet full interest 
obligations. Not until very recently 
ha e the first s teps been taken towards 
a solution . The largest tasks are still 
ahead . 

Pedro-Pablo Kuczynski , one of the 
world's outstanding investment 
bankers, international economist a nd 
pecialist on debt management , will 

brief us on the nature of the current 
problems and on what the future hold s 
for revitalizing world eco nomic devel-
opment and Latin American growth . 
As senior executive of First Boston , 
Mr. Kuczynski is financial advisor to 
important countries as well as to 
major international corporations . 

The briefing will be on Thursday, 
Feb. 4, at 4:30 in the Institute of 
Americas. Admission is $10 for 
members a nd $15 for non-members .

Scripps pier demolition 
to close beach access 

Beginning the last week of January, 
demolition and removal of the Scripps 
Pier will require the closure of public 
access to a portion of the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography beach 
during the contractor's working hours. 
A new pier has been built to replace 
the 70-year-old San Diego landmark . 
The demolition is for a period of 
approximately six weeks. 

The closure includes beach access 
under both the old and new piers and 
to the beach north of the piers. Tem-
porary barricades will be erected from 
the Scripps seawall into the surf zone 
adjacent to the piers and at the ramp 
north of the old pier. All swimmers 
and surfers will be required to main-
tain a 3OO-foot distance from the pier. 
Construction equipment will be set up 
on the beach to conduct the demoli-
tion, and materials will be removed by 
truck . 

Public access will be maintained 
most nights and weekend during the 
demolition period, while actual work 
is not in progress.

Shuttle 
Continued from pace I 

The parking shuttle buses were 
used by the medical school in the 
past, so their cost to the school 
was n(x t to nothing. The shuttles 
have been paid for ou t of park -
ing sticker fees, s hared amongst 
student . staff, a nd faculty. 

The shuttle was initiated not 
on ly to ensure safety for those 
walking to and from parking 
lot, but a lso to c ut down on the 

amount students have to tra vel. 
Rush hours for the shuttle are 
from 8 am to 11 :15 am and 2 pm 
to 5:30 pm, when two shuttles 
run , at other times during the 
day and night only one bus is in 
operation . The sh uttle ca n hold 
35 passe ngers, 25 sitting a nd 10 
standing. However, as ve hicle 
maintenance coordinator (a nd 
occasional bus driver ) Jim Bon-
nardel put it, "That depends on

Whisenhunt sticks with 
charge against A.S. 
Editor: 

I am writing to you rega rdin,!!. the article your staff wrote in the last 
i ue of the Guardian. In part, I feel that the Guardian has done a 
pretty good Job in relating my viewpoint , although there arc some 
points which I believe should be add res ed . 

When I walked into that meeting last Wedne day night to inquire 
about the meeting time, I wa more than astonsihed to hear Dave 
Manheim make the comment that he hoped that A .A.S .U. wouldn't 
come to the meeting. 

First of all, it is important to realize that although I am an 
African-American student, I am also a UCSD studenl. And because 
of this, the issues that the council chooses to discuss that I feel are 
important are not issues based solely on my ethnicity, but also issues 
that affect me as any other student on this campus. The que tion that 
perplexes me the most i : Who is to say when a tudent, or a group of 
students, cannot, or should not, attend a meeting? 

I do not feel that it is morally correct for me to assume that 
Manheim'sjustification of the comment is, or is not, correct. All that 
1 heard him say wa that he hoped A.A .S. , wasn't coming to the 
meeting, then later tate that he welcomed anyone to attend the A.S . 
board meetings . 

I believe it i also necessary to address that although [the A.A .S. U. 
and the People's Voice] are run primarily by African-American 
tudents , they are two separate entities . 

I'd rather not "hash on" about this issue becau e I think that far 
too often issues such as these escalate. Rather, I hope that if anything 
emerges from thi issue it' that we, as student of all colors, become 
more a ware of our diver itie and work to unify our differences 
through positive and collect i e efforts from the A .S . Board and all 
other organization .

Reagan a "useful idiot" 
or worse than that? 
Editor: 

Howard Phillip , an enthusiastic member of the lunatic fringe of 
the GOP, was only half right when he called Pres;dent Reagan a 
"useful idiot" for the Soviets. 

But Reagan 's performance as president the past seven years makes 
many American object to Phillips' caricature of Reagan a "useful." 
And that applied double for the man's past record in negotiating 
nuclear and conventional arms reduction pacts with the so-called 
"evil empire." 

Indeed . II of the last II U.S. Soviet summits have been exercises in 
utter futility thanks to Reagan 's handlers ' stubborn refu al to com-
promise on "Star Wars," a trillion dollar Edsel , which still threatens 
to further militarize the nation's economy. 

Until the attitude of those new in power change nothing will be 
generated but the usual right wing rhetoric, with last December's 
Reykjavik's mcetings between Gorbachev and Reagan being fal ely 
trumpted as a monumental success as a recent example. 

Even now, Reagan's tryi ng to placate the wealthy, hard-right 
conservatives, like Texas billionaire H . Ro s Perot , who twice 
financed his election. Earlier thi month Reagan accused the Soviets 
of spending billions to erect what he called "a Red shield" which is 
supposed to be the Communist's equivalent to America's Strategic 
Defense Initiative, so much beloved by this administration. 

During Thanksgiving week, Reagan, in Florida , under cored the 
beliefs of U.S. policy makers that without SSI, America "would be 
totally -and dangerously unprepared ." This presents a quandary to 
warmongers who feel Americans literally can't live without it, and 
peace-seekers, who are convinced the world can't su rvive with il. 

As the superpowe rs continue propelling the planet toward 
Armagedden , Star Wars should have been the main course on the 
negotiating table, not merely insignificant dinner crumbs to be 
brushed aside.

to develop areas that' are co m-
mercially viable," Colgan aid. 

The Hartford Foundation, a 
private institution located in New 
York worth about $150 million, 
usually funds grants to improve 
health care services for the elderly 
and s t imulate health care pay-
ment sys tem reform. A co uple of 
years ago they decided to exa-
mine the issue of "technology 
transfer. " 

The Foundation wa interested 
in having an in titution look at 
its own "technology tran fer" 

system (the principle a nd con-
cerns at pla y) and make recom-
mendat ions that would be ap-
plica ble to other universities and 
campuses. Proposa ls were so-
licited from 12 uni ve rsi ties to 
st ud y Bio-technology transfer 
(which has a pplicat ions to tech-
nology transfer in general) . Two 
grants were awarded, one to 
Texas Southwestern University 
in Dallas to se t up a model bio-
technology program. and the 
seco nd to U D, to study the 
feasibility of the bio-tech pro-
gram. 

The Hartford Study began in 
A pril of 1986 a nd ended in Octo-
ber 1987. The report, according 
to Dr. Oliver W . Jones, a UC D 

professor of genetics and a prin-
cipal co-inves tiga to r on the fa-
culty advisory committee for the 
Hartford Study of Bio-tech Trans-
fer , is now being publi hed and 
should be released within the 
m onth . 

The recommendations that 
come from the report will depend 
on how the universit y views the 
report, but it i Dr. J ones' hope 
that there will be a UCSD office 
developed to improve bio-tech 
transfer relations on ca mpus, and 
act as a possible liason between 
industry, the university. and the 
UC Patent office in Berkeley. 

According to Dr. Jones, "a 
cri tical com ponent to the success 

of a technology transfer effort i 
the education of the faculty . In 
the main, the individual investi-
ga tor will probably decide if he 
has an idea that ha s potential 
patentability. He must make the 
first step and receive assistance 
from a UCSD office that would 
then carry his idea forward, 
doing the legwork so that he 
could pend more time on re-
search and less on patenting and 
licensi ng issues." 

There are programs on ca mpus 
today with information that can 
be helpful to a ny faculty or stu-
dent researcher who has an idea 
he wants to develop. The "Con-
nect" program is designed to 
"connect" engineers and scien-

ti ts with bankers, lawyer, and 
accountants who are interested 
in supporting the development 
of technology. This i done by 
informal meetings where these 
businessmen can meet the re-
searc hers and see what research 
is being done at UCSD. 

The "Connect" program also 
sponsors lectures and eminars 
that teach researchers financing 
strategies for technological start-
ups, management , marketing and 
personnel manage ment. Al-
though the program is primarily 
directed toward the public sector, 
the wealth of information in these 
seminars is availab le to faculty 
and students at UCSD at a sub-
stantial savings.

Students pursue choice internships 
By KATHRINA PETERSON 

R inging phones deafened the enormous room a men and women dressed 
in suits scurried from one cubicle 
to the next. There was a sense of 
fear and excitement. These bu i-
ness people were caught up in 
consoling one anothe r. This was 
the scene of LJ Hooker Interna-
tional (formerly Merril Lynch) 
on Black Monday. Cecilia Mar-
celino , a U CS D intern working 
as a marketing researcher wit-
nessed what it meant to be a 
broker at a time of emergency. 
"The broker I worked for was 
panicking. He had money on the 
stock market and that's all that 
mattered . I remember someone 
saying that Iran was bombed 
that same day. Hejust replied, 'I 
don't care. The market was 
down,' .. Marcelino said in 
disbelief. 

Marcelino, a management 
science major, is one of the 650 
students who pa rticipate annu-
ally in the internship programs 
offered by UCS D: the Academic 

Linda Feldman, AlP advisor 

'PRICES INCLUDE: 
graphiC cut, shampoo, 
conditioning and 
professional styling 

Internship Progran, ~AIP) and 
the Associated tudents Intcrn-
ship Office (ASIO), Although 
both programs differ on intern 
selection criteria, commitment 
and re pon ibilities. they do 
share one common goal - to 
enable students to take their 
education beyond the university, 
and gain on- ite experience in 
fields related to their major areas 
of study. 

"It is an opportunity to take 
the theories from the classrooms 
and bring them out into the real 
world," said AI P assistant direc-
tor Linda Feldman. These theor-
ies can be developed into practi-
cal skills in such diverse areas as 
stations, medical research labs, 
museum, and electronic firms. 

Sponsored by Warren College, 
AI P is headed by trained cou nse· 
lors who a ist students in attain-
ing internship positions in ex-
change for a maximum of 16 
units of academic credit accumu-
lated throuj!,hout their four yea~ 
atUC D. lnordertobeeligible, 
one must have completed 90 units 
prior to application, and at least 
a 2.5 GPA. AlP's placements 
need students to have certain 
background to enable them to be 
ready for their job. "It 's real 
work out there [not just busy 
work]," Feldman said. 

If a st udent is qualified, he 
then proceed with the applica-
tion process which consists of a 
resume, a cover letter and an 
interview. Meanwh ile. he is as-
sisted by an AI P counselor. " We 
try to work with them [the tu-
dents] until they find a position , 
but the student does have the 
final responsibility." Moreover, 
she said, is admitted into the 
program, the student is requ ired 
to write a research paper/ project 
under su pervisio n of a faculty 
advisor. 

AI P intern Joel Garcia con-
firmed Feldman's positio n that 
this intern program gives stu-
dents more than just "busy 
work ." As a summer intern in the 
Mechanical Design Application 
Group in San Diego R&D 

(G . E. Calma), Garcia was re-
sponsible for the comph;tiun uf a 
Robot-Si m user's manual. The 
Robot- im is a programming 
language incorporating the use 
of data base and realistic geo-
metric modeling to reprogram 
robot before they a re purchased . 
Garcia also developed the robot 
library that accompa nies thi s 
product. Technical knowledge is 
obviously a must in order to 
work there. "There's no one 
holding your hand .. . [in a way] I 
was a profe sional ,"Garcia said . 

If AIPsoundstoodemanding, 
there's no need to worry - ASIO 
is here to rescue you. Unlike 
AlP, ASIO is student run -
with six student directors and 17 
volunteers. It has no GPA cut-
off, nor class level preference. 
"We just want good representa-
tives of our office who will behave 
in a professional manner. "We 
try not to screen people off," said 
Deneen Frazier, ASIO executive 
director. She added that getting 
in to the program is not difficult. 
"Just how that you have moti-
vation, dedication and a will to 
learn." 

Like AlP, very few students 
do not get placed in an internship 
position . 
positions are non-paying and do 
not offer academic credit. Interns 
se rve as volunteer. Moreover, 
unlike AlP, ASIO does not 
require a technical know-how 
for the specific field being app-
lied for (but it does help). Frazier 
added, "We're looking more to 
give student a foot in the door." 

ASIO does not offer the same 
degree of ha nd soon experience as 
AI P , so students are sometimes 

I . 
discouraged . For example, 
so metimes a lawyer assistant is 
no more than a glorified title for 
a clerk. "Students [can get] disil-
lusio ned and think - 'Hey, I 'm 
am not getting a case,' [What 
they fail to realize is that] they 
are there to observe and see how 
they [the lawyers] are doing their 
work ," student Caroline Tihany 
said. This, however, does not 
mean that all interns in ASIO are

1912 was turned over to the 
direction of the University of 
California , who named its south-
ernmost outpost Scripps I nsti-
tution for Biological Research. 
In 1925, the name was changed 
to the present one to better reflect 
the facility's operations and 
goals. . 

Today It's difficult to picture 
the remote, four-building Scripps 
campus of decades ago. Now set 
amidst a busy residential area, 
Scripps occupies 65 buildings on 
230 acres of land and operates 
four research vessels and two 
experimental platforms stationed 
at the Scripps Nimitz Marine 
Facility. 

The annual budget, which was 
$4,500 in 1903 is now about $60 
million, most of which comes 
from the federal government, 
with the top two supporters being 
the National Science Foundation 
and the Department of the Navy.

enting over 200 pecies. 
Scripps is manged by a unique 

system of departments and their 
individual groups, with a staff of 
1,100. According to Chuck Col-
gan, public information repre-
sentative for Scripps, "it is strik-
ing how differently Scripps is 
run, when compared to other 
educational institutions." 

Though the institute boasts a 
graduate following of roughly 
190 or so students pursuing 
degrees in oceanographic fields, 
Scripps is primarily a research 
institution and is run as such. 
Tom Collins, the associate direc-
tor for SIO, has responsibilities 
that include jurisdiction over 
facilities, staff, contracts, finan-
ces, budget, and the funding of 
research and development. 
However, academic policy and 
the choosing of academic per-
sonnel is handled through the 
University of California. Another 
associate director, George Shor, 
oversees ship operations and 
ocean graphics.

involved only in busy work . 

Senior Kay Ca mpbell , a bio-
chemistry major, plans to attend 
graduate school and wanted work 
ex pe rience to spice up her 
resume, "I wanted to go into 
research. but a lot of professors 
did not ha ve room. There's usu-
ally more than enough people 
for the job or you'd have to be in 
a work-study program . I am not 
on work-study so that closed a 
lot [of options] right there," she 
said. In addition to experience, 
profes ors wanted research as-
sistants to work a comparative 
number of hours. 

Feeling cornered, Campbell 
turned to ASIO and is now 
working 10 hours a week for a 
professor on campu . (On cam-
pus positions are especially good 
for those without transporta-
tion) . "I perform a lot of exper-
iments but I'm also being super-
vised - just in case I have a 
question," Campbell added . Her 
duties include labeling DN A and 
growing cell culture to be used in 
experiments . Campbell's job is 
obviously not that of just busy 
work . 

Like Campbell , Marcelino also 
participated in an ASIO intern-
s hip position . Working as a 
broker for LJ Hooker Interna-
tional, Marcelino did some cold-
calling (phoning strangers, etc.) 
in order to sell hopping centers. 
Dressed in a suit, the senior inte-
racted with the other brokers 
and worked in the same envir-
onment. After participating in 
the 10-week program , she 

realized that " I didn't really like 
COld-calling. You need a differ-
ent personality. That's good, 
though, because after being there , 
I know I can do it , but if I had a 
choice. I woulqn't do il." 

Although Marcelino did not 
earn money or credits, she wa s 
thankful for her ex pe rience. 
Hearing lltt: It:l,;ltlli~ai language 
she learned in an accounting 
class being app lied on the job 
proved for her that college 
cou rses are applicable to real life 
after all. More important , how-
ever, was the exposure he re-
ceived in the bu incss: "Connec-
tions - lots of them," she aid. 

Connection certainly proved 
to be a great asse t to Garcia, 
especially when applying to gra-
duate school. By participating as 
an intern, Garcia left an unfor-
gettable impression on his 
employer, and as a result. he has 
acquired letters of recommenda-
tion for his graduate sc hool. 
According to the mechanical 
engi neering major, his employ-
er's recommendation will have 
the most weight in his selection 
for graduate school. The reason 
for this is that the field to which 
he is applying happens to be his 
employer's field of speciality -
that of robotics. "The professor's 
recommendation will matter, but 
not as heavily. They will talk 
only of my technical knowledge. 
but his [the employer's] recom-
mendation will sh ut the lid ," 
Garcia said. 

Internships serve to clarify or 
focus one's goal ofa career after 
college. Because of the hands-on 
experience, students have a bet-
ter idea as to what to expect in 
the "real world ." [ill

ments and research units. The 
graduate department, for exam-
ple, consists of various fields of 
oceanography - such as biolog-
ical oceanography, geophysics 
and marine biology. 

Scripps' floating laboratories 
log thousands of nautical miles 
each year - gathering valuable 
first-hand information about the 
oceans, as well as collecting 
samples of marine life, sand and 
sedime nt. The labs also record 
data on bird migration, erosion 
and weather patterns in the area . 

The general research effort at 
Scripps is conducted by three 

departments: the Marine Biol-
ogy and Geological and Ocean 
Research divisions. There are 
also three special laboratories 
containing the newest equipment 
a vai lable for the scienti st 's use. 
Special collections of rocks and 
marine life as well as a diving 
facility are other resources for 
the researchers. I n addition, 
Scripps' Aquarium-Museum pro-
vides educational courses for the 
pUblic. UCSD students may also 
become involved in work-study 
programs, or serve as volunteers 
oraquarist trainees at SIO. Their 
campus also contains a library 
and controls a radio station. 

Collins , who has been a 
member of Scripps administra-
tion for five years, sees his work 
as necessary and important. "[I 

use] the knowledge and skills I 
have in management in order to 
allow progress to go forward 
with a minimum of impedance. 
This way, researchers are free to 
do what they do best." Collins 
added . 

Progress is on-going at 
Scripps. The new $4 million pier 
is about done, Collins said. An 
expanded aquarium-museum is 
in the planning stages. Scripps 
provides prestige for the com-
munity as well as being a major 
public attraction . 

"The best part about Scripps 
though, is the people . We are a 
community, and I can't ever 
imagine doing anything more 
interesting or challenging than 
the work I do here," Collins 
concluded . @)

Preview 
Men's tennis season 
gets underway 

By MICHAEL U'REN 
Staff Wriur 

The men's tennis sea on is 
now underway . Although they 
suffered consecutive losse to 
Division 1 schools USIU and 
San Diego State Universit y 
Monda y and Tuesday, second 
year coach Jon Hammermeister 
feels that his team will be com-
peting for one of the 10 at-large 
berths for the NCAA Division 
I II National Tournament. "This 
is the best team we've had since 
1984," claims Hammermeister, 
once a member of the 1984 tea m 
that went on to the national 
tournament. 

This year's team received a 
ranking of No. 9 in the nation at 
the Division 1lI level in the pre-
season polls. The team i headed 
by o. I singles player Hunter 
Gallaway. Gallway, a ophomore 
from Sacramento, is 2·2 on the 
yearand is ranked 0. 43 in the 
nation . Hammermeister ha been 
impressed with the play of his 

o. I singles player and said , 
"Gallaway is playing very well 
and is a great asset to our team." 

At the 0. 3 spot for the Trit-
ons is last year's team captain 
and only returning senior, Kyle 
Knapp. Knapp received a pre-
season ranking of No. 23 but has 
gotten off to a slow start this sea-
son with a 0-4 record . Hammer-
meister doesn't seem to be too 
worried about the senior, " Kyle 
will come around . It usually takes 
him about a month to get started . 
Last year he began the season 0-6 
but came on strong at the end of 
the year." 

Sig Huber, who played in the 
No . 4 slot for the Tritons last 
season, worked very hard on his 
game during the off-season and 
is now the No. 2 singles player on 
the team. Following Gallaway, 
Huber and Knapp are John Park , 
a freshman out of Coronado 
High School , Frank Monnar and 
Tim Ditzler. Playing first dou-
bles for the Tritons are Huber 
and freshman Jim Eliot. Galla-

way and Monnar combine to 
make up the econd doubles team 
and Knapp and Jeff French team 
up to round out the doubles 
combinations. 

On M onday the Tritons 
quared off agai nst US I U and 

fell to the Divi io n I team , 6-3 . 
No. () Tim Ditzler was the only 
ingles player to taste victory, 

beating Roberto Mello 6·1 , 6-4 . 
Ditzler also defeated Jim H ig-
gins , of San Diego State Univer-
sity, the following day to run his 
record to 4-0 on the year. When 
asked a bout his performance thus 
far, Coach Hammermeister com-
mented, "Ditzler is playing great 
this seaso n. He is probably the 
best athlete on the team and 
worked ve ry hard in the off-
season to improve from last year's 

o . 9 spot to the NO. 6 spot on 
the roster this season ." The 
second doubles team of Galla-
wayand Monnar won by default 
and the third doubles team of 
Knapp and French were also vic-
torious , running their pre-season 
record to 2-1 . 

The following day, the Tritons 
faced another Divisio n I rival, 
the San Diego State Aztecs. The 
Triton split the singles matches 
with the Aztecs three ga mes 
apiece . Huber, Monnar, and 
Ditzler were all victorious. The 
Tritons then went on to split the 
first two doubles matches wi th 
the Aztecs to keep the score tied 
at 4-4 . In the la t doubles match 
the Tri tons spl it the first two sets 
but eventually lost the third and 
deciding set in a highly intense 
battle. 

Coach Hammermeister said in 
his closing comments, "We play 
a very tough schedule with about 
70 percent of our matches against 
Division I schools . This yea r we 
have six freshmen on the team 
which are proba bl y the most 
talented group of kids we have 
ever had in the tennis program 
here at UCSD. I feel that we 
have the personnel to get into the 
national tour nament thi s 
year." (Q)

On Jan. 16-17, the UCSD 

fencing team debuted their 
talent in the All-Cal Fencing 
Tournament at UCLA in the 
John Wooden Center. All UC 
school except UC Riverside 
were in attendance at the 
tournament. 

The Tritons took first place 
as a team in both the sabre 
and epee events. They also 
placed second in the men's foil 
divi ion and the women took 

sixth place in the women's foil 
events. 

Leading the Triton team 
was Tim Ash , who took first 
place in the men's sa bre. 
William Comenat fOllowed in 
close pursuit, finishing second 
behind Ash . 

In the epee event, John 
Keller had a fourth place finish 
and Jeff Lehmann took 
eighth. Peter Pak finished in 
the fourth spot and Amon 

Friedman took eighth place in 
the men's foil and Kathy Cox 
finished second in the women's 
foil. 

The team must now look to 
Saturday night when they take 
on UCLA , Cal State Uni-
versity Fullerton and Occiden-
tal College at UCSD. If the 
Tritons are unable to win the 
tournament, they will be eli-
minated from the national pic-
ture and could possibly end 
their season altogether. 

Men's basketball falls to 
Athletes 95-85 
By JONA THAN SCHREYER 
Sports Editor 

On Tuesday night , UC San 
Diego's men's basketball team 
played host to the travel ing 
Athletics in Action in an ex-
hibition game in the Triton 
Pavi llion . 

A.I.A.'s Zack Jones scored 25 
points as the Athletes took the 
game 95-85 over the Tritons. 

Mark Gottfried added 24 
points for A.l.A. (2 I -9). The 
team shot an impressive 60.5 
percent from the field to take a 
14 point lead by halftime , 50-36. 
Gib HiOl, who pulled down 15 
rebounds. and Reid Gettys each 
scored 17 points for A . l.A. 

Despite the numbers posted 
by the Athletes and foot injuries 
to starting guards Tim Rapp and 
Rob Rittgers , the Tritons man-
aged to stay in the game. Fresh-
man Grey Paskwietz scored 21 
and freshman Dan Troy scored 
19, each starti ng forthe first time

more atmospheric material,

mysticism that makes Gua -

they 'let the music do the work, 

Hailing from Marietta, 
Georgia, it comes as no sur-
prise that Guadalcanal Diary's 
style of music i influenced by 
the sounds of country and 
western , "It's kind of hard to 
avoid it , living in the South," 
explains Jeff Walls , "As a 
matter of(act, 1 grew up hating 
a lot of the cou ntry and we -t-
ern band becau e they play it 
[in Georgia] all the time ." 

Band member Murray 
Attaway , John Poe, and Jeff 

Walls met in high school when 
they decided to form a band . 
Rhett Crow joined the band a 
few years later to complete the 
ensemble. Originally, the band 
ventured into different styles 
of music, unlike their present 
style, to compete with other 
new artists. "After a while we 
knew best," Walls said in a 
Southern accent, " I remember 
when 1 was rea lly little, the 
Johnny Horton band had all 
thesongsabouttheCivi l War _ 
That's the kind of music Iii -
ten\.,d to when I was growing 
up in Georgia." 

Tht' undeniable religious 

overtones is a theme that is 
present throughout all their 
albums, "It's a two-sided idea 
with us," Walls said . "On the 
one side, the fact that we're 
from the South where there's 
a church on every corner, we 
feel like we've grown up in 
that kind of social environ-
ment . But at the same time , 
knowing that we can get a dif-
ferent perspective to the 
humor and irony of religion 
allows us to make light of it. 1 
really have a fascination with 
the supernatural." 

As Guadalcanal Diary tours 
the nation to promote the 

release of their new album 
"2x4," Walls sees the futur~ 
of the band as entailing "play-
ing larger arenas, but it proba-
bly won't be far along in our 
careers. We still play ttny 
clubs. Hopefully, we can get 
out of that and into small 
theatre size places , It's some-
thing we're all looking for-
ward to becau e we've had a 
really hard time dealing with 
the production level and peo-
ple sayi ng we're in it for the 
money , But, then , 1 can ima-
gine all of that starting to 
change as we bee me more 
p pular."

Recreating the Falls .. 
by nigellindemann 

hiatus writer 

"Niagara" is a movie about 
the great god" Niagara Falls." 
A child of the ice age, Niagara 
dwells on the U .S.lCanadian 
border where he has rolled 
merrily along - roaring his 
terrible roars and gnashing his 
terrible teeth - for millen~ 
iums, interrupted only by the 
occasional follies of film crews 
and o ther foolish mortals . 

Enter director Merill and 
his band of swashbuckling 
adve nturers . Their quest: to 
n:-create some of the historical 
events and daredevil stunts 
which surround the Niagara 
Falls region . This is not an 
easy task, especially when one 
considers the fact that both 
the state of New York and the 
provi nce of Ontario have 
passed laws prohibiting the 
performance of stunts over 
the falls. A total of 15 agencies 
on either side of the border 
needed to grant their permis~ 
sion, with an enormous 
amount of liability insurance 
having to be secured before 
the crew could proceed with 
filming. 

But the film was made, and 
what emerged from the effort 
is a short, but beautiful and 
thrilling accou nt of the life 
and times of the falls . Filmed 
in IMAX and projected onto 
the Reuben H . Fleet Space 
Theater's giant dome, " Niag-
ara" gives the viewer much 
more of a sense of participating 
in the action than is possible 
in a conventio nal theater. The 
result is that the audience is 
able to experience vicariously 
Niagara Falls through the eyes 

Ti~htrope \IIalkin~ is one of the many Stttncs performed over Niagara Falls. 

of those who braved it. 
Some of those people in-

elude: (1) A Native~American 
woman who, rather than 
marry the oldest and most 
aromati man in the village, 
opts to jump in her canoe and 
head for the gorge. (2) "The 
Great Blondin" : a Frenchman 
with good balance who decides 
to tryout his theory that the 
shortest dista nce between two 
points is a straight line. (3) 
Annie Taylor: a 63-year~0Id 
daredevil who grabs her cat 

and takes Niagara in a barrel. 
"Niagara" can perhaps be 

criticized for elevating a mass 
of water and rocks into the 
realm of the universally spiri-
tual. It is basically a good film, 
however, and I recommend it. 
"Niagara" is cu rrently playing 
at the Reuben H . Fleet Space 
Theater in Balboa Park. Ad~ 
mission is $4.50 for adults, 
with entrance to the Science 
Center included in the ticket 
price. For showtimes, call 
238-1233. 

Animated festival Arts Editors 
EVA WONG 
SUSIE BEEL by tina rich 

The Festival of Animation 
- showing unril March 14 at 
the La Jolla Museum of Con~ 
temporary Art - once again 
displays the imaginations of 
talented artists. There is always 
an abundant display of cre~ 
ativity at the festivals, and this 
year's show is no exception. 
Compared to the 1987 show, 
however, the films are shorter 
and involve less storytelling. 

Nevertheless, this year's 
festival does present a number 
of interesting animation films. 

Jane Aaron's "Traveling 
Light," is o ne such film. It 
involves animation combining 

with real scenery and other 
films made from paper, clay, 
and computer animation. 

Friday and Saturday shows 
feature appearances by some 
of the animation artists.

acclaimed films, representing 
countries around the world, 
which promise to be worth 
watching. 

by mark kenney 
hiatus writer 

The water shortages did not 
stop UC D's second inter-

. national style film series from 
opening Jan. 19 with the 
British film, "Mona Lisa." 
Following "Mona Lisa," the 
first of 14 films which make 
up the series will be a' col-
lection of highly praised films, 
many of which will be making 
their San Diego premieres. 

"Mona Lisa" features Bob 
Hoskins as a petty crook who 

SOREKARA 

makes the nearly fatal mistake 
of becoming involved with a 
prostitute (Cathy Tyson) . This 
powerful movie was directed 
by Neil Jordan and tars 
Michad Caine. 

The next movie, to be 
shown this Tuesday, Feb. 2 at 
8 pm, "Opera Do Malandro," 
is a satire on Brazil's duplicity 
during World War II . This 
film is based loosely on "Thn:e 
Penny Opera." 

The series continues 
through June when it will close 
with "No Surrender," a film 

about an Iri h nightclub man-
ager who ddiberately books a 
group of aging IRA Ca tholi cs 
and Irish Protestants together 
for a Nl'W Year's Eve cek·bration. 

Sondra Locke will make a 
per onal appearance on Mon-
day Feb. 22, following the 
screening of the film "Rat 
Boy." In addition to directing 
and starring, Locke was largely 
responsib le for W arner Bro-
thers' dt'cision to produce the 
movie. 

The appropriately named 
movie, which has never been 
shown in San Diego, tells the 
story of a young Hollywood 
boy who looks, quite literally, 
like a rat. 

Other films which will be 
shown include "To Sleep So 
As to Dream," "Sorekara," 
and "Himatsuri ," all from 
Japan; "Nostalghia," a Russian 
film; the Italian comic epi 
"Allonsanfan;" the Mongolian 
film , "On The Hunting 
Grounds;" "Funny, Dirty 
Little War," a satire from 
Argentina; the Peruvian mys-
tery-thriller "Malabrigo;" and 
"The Holy Innocents," from 
Spain. 

The award-winning French 
film "Vagabond" was shown 
last Tuesday. The movies will

Another exceptional cut is 
Glenn Phillip' "Vista

is a fantastic song that illu-
minates his guitar~p l aying abil~

"No Age" is definitely not

of brilliant talent that can only 
be appreciated by tho e who 
dare to stray from the sobriety 
of commercial musi ,and who 
can identify with music that is 
diver e and often frenzied.
