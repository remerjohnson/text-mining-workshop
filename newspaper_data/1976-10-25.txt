Student Fees Up_ All Over I 
The Nation, 'Not Just at UC 

by steve LemRD 
(CPS) - Money is again 

flowing from student wallets as 
they face tuition and other fee 
hikes upon returning to their 
campuses. While students this 
year are still $helling out more 
money than ever, some schools 
have already announced ad-
ditional hikes planned for next 
year. Student opposition, 
however, is scattered across the 
nation. The soaring tuition costs 
are met with moods ranging 
from submission to frustration. 

Student -lobbyists in 
California say they will be 
protesting a proposed across-
the-board registration fee in-
crease due for next year. The 
UC Board of Regents have 
mandated an across-the-board 
increase of $48, and in addition 
have given each campus 
discretionary power to further 
increase the reg fee up to $24 
next year and $21 the year after. 
Chancellor McElroy must make 
his recommendation on the 

incre~se for UCSD by Nov. 15. 
Tuition rose in New Jersey an 

average of $169 per student over 
last year. Undergraduate 
students of the State University 
of New York (SUNY) are 
paying up to $200 mora, while 
costs for graduates went up an 
extra $400. ' The University of 
New Hampshire upped tuition 
by $100 for residents and $390 
for non-residents. Students at 
the University of Massachusetts 
will see a total increase of $225 
spread out over two-and-a-half 
years. 

UCSD students may see their 
fees increase $93 over the nnt 
two years. And so it goes for 
students across the country. 
Student OpposWon FallIDg Off 
student ~positoin to various 

tuition and fee hikes has fallen 
off at the start of this academic 
year, a contrast to last spring, 
which saw two state capitols 
stormed, a . chancellor pelted 
with eggs and buildings taken 
over in protest of the hikes. 
Many student .groups are now 
attemptmg to act as legal 
collective bargaining agents. 
Other groups are lobbying 
legislators and registering 
people to vote against those who 
would raise their fees. 

Although a tuition increase 
has been passed in New Jersey, 
tudent Association (NJSA) .is 
taking credit for keeping the 
hike to a minimum. The 
president of N JSA, Frank 
Robinson, felt that actions 
taken last spring such as direct 
legislative lobbying, massive 
letter campaigns ' and demon-
strations, kept the increase $100 
less than originally proposed. 
Efforts in other state schools 
have not seemed as successful. 

An end to spiraling 
educational costs does not seem 
in sight. students returning to 
school are learning of increases 

. planned for next year, and 
student leade~ find their hands 
tied by .apathy. Kansas 
residents J.ace A .. increase 
next fall; non-residents $150. At 
Iowa State University, where a 
10 percent tuition increase is 
proposed for next year, the 
student president saw the lack 
of student concern as "a signal 
of the times." 

Lobbying Efforts Useless 
A tentative statewide plan 

proposed by the New York 
Board of Regents may increase 
state university students' 
tuitions by $1000, according to a 
study by the Student~

UC Requests Funding Increase 
In line with recommendations 

made by its finance subconunlttee, 
the University of California Friday 
asked the state for an 11.5 percent 
ir)crease in funding for 1977-78. The 
request is part of a record $2.2 
billion budget request. 

Although total UC enrollment is 
expected to be virtually unchanged 
next year, and statewide 
enrollment projections indicate a 
decreased enrollment demand 
after the 197~ school year, 
University of California President 

- Saxon indicated that the increase 

in the bUdget request would cover be needed to offset increases that 
"a very small fraction of the will be needed in the years after 
urgent needs" at the nine cam- that.

regents without dissent calls for 
$723 million in state support, a $75 
million increase from last year. 

Saxon said inflation had hit the 
university particularly hard. He 
said more than half of the proposed 
state increase was to cover in-

Unorthodox Harris Challenging McCloskey in Bay Area 
by Rlebard K. Yep 

Staff Correspoadeat 

SAN FRANCISCO-Wbo .. . David 
Harris? 

Political observers call 1m 
congressional campaign the best 
organized in the United States. 

He is challenging Paul ' 
McCloskey, the "maverick'" 
Republican of the House of 
Representatives. 

He has served a 20 month prison 
term for draft evasion (he would 
not accept a student deferment, 
and then resisted induction into the

armed services.) 
Folksinger Joan Baez would call 

him her ex-husband. 
To say that David Harris, 30, is 

just another Democratic 
congressional candidate would be 
a gross understatement. 

The former student activist is 
currently locked in a political 
battle with McCloskey, another 
unique individual. 

This political duel is taking place 
in the San FranciscG Bay Atea's 
12th ,Congressional district, which 
represents over 463,000 peoPle, 60 
percent white-collar workers. 

Harris' campaign has had to be 
well~rganized. When he began his 
challenge for the Democratic 
nomination for Congress 17 months 
ago, not many thought he would get 
half as far as he has. 

Harris is not a hand-shaking, 
baby-kissing candidate, but rather 
one of the new, "realist 
politicians. " He has done his 
homework, and is well-versed on 
many topics. When be is stumped 
by a question or unsure of a fact, he 
won't dodge it. He says he doesn't 
know, and then does a follow-up. 

Hia Ideas for America are 
rather far-reaching, yet, as he 
delClibes the method of im-
plementation for his plans, a 
penon can begin to understand 
that, although radical, they make 

some sense. 
When speaking on energy, 

Harris says he believes con-
servation is the alternative to the 
Ford Administration program. 
Harris' plan begins by taking a 
careful look at energy consumption 
and penalizing those who use the 
most energy, 

"We should maintain lifeline 
rates on the federal level so that 
there is a basic amount of energy 
for consumers at cheaper prices, 
and decontrol prices after that, so 
that big users will lead the effort in 
conservation," says Harris. 

Harris believes this conservation 
program will cover America until 
some alternative energy sources 
are available. Harris would also 
like to see more legislation in 
support of solar energy. 

As for the oil companies' 
monopoly, Harris believes 
divestiture is a good principle. 
"Clearly, there is a real lack <i 
market place competition in the 
energy industry." 

Although he sees many problems 
with the Humphrey-Hawkins Full 
Employment Bill, Harris says he 
will support It if it is the only option 
available. He feels that we must 
"commit ourselves wholehear-
tedly to a policy of full em-
ployment. 

"The key to solving unem-

ployment is tax reform, shifting 
the burden of taxation upward in 
the income scale, so the money at 
the bottom of the income scale can 
be used for housing, better food, 
the staples of life," he says. 

Described by many as a " fighter 
for the underprivileged," Harris 
was asked whether he would be 
able to represent a 60 percen~ white 
collar district, where less than five 
percent have incomes below the 
poverty level. 

"Sure," he answered. " I don't 
see any problem with representing 
different kinds of people. The 
social programs I've talked about 
are for all of us." 

In summing up his candidacy, 
Harris said, " After spending all 
my adult life trying to change 
people's votes, I couldn't figure out 
why I coul<in't go to Congress and 
vote myself ." 

From the beginning one and a 
half yea~ ago, the Harris cam-
paign has tried to insure that their 
support was. 't just from young 
people (although be admits much 
of his support WlU be from people 
of his generation) . 

Harris is hoping for a broftd bIlse 
<i support. " Without it, I won't win, 
that's for sure." 

Most financial contributions to 
the campaign have av raged about 
$30. Whil Harris claims that,

my October U article on lIlepl 
aliens. In particular, It la 
nece8ll8ry to note the Irresponsible

letters. 

One letter, by M. Elcan, referred 
to me as "Hitler resurrected," and 
another, signed by nine 
organizations, refer. to my 
prOposals as "coinciding with 
those ol the AmericanÂ· Nazi Par-
ty." Such calumniate and baseless 
slanders and Hbels tÂ»ear witness to

writers. Mr. Elean and the nine 
organizations should all grow up, 
graduate from ~ nursery scliool 
of mudslinging and nameealling, 
and learn to face issues squarely 
and logically. 

Mr. Funk and the nine 
organizations did present some 
statistics and several definite, 
valid points of disagreement which 
provide a basis for responsible 
discussion .. 

However, MECHA, BStJ, and 
seven other groups condenmed the 
TrltoD 'IbDeI for.prirjing my ar-

We wish him luck. 'lbe Coop Is divided In many way., bat perhaps the 
deepest ICblam hJages on the Student Body PresldeDtl' CoUDdl. Some Fen to n's 
Coop memben propoee .It should be aboUshed. 

. It would be foolilb for the Coop to eadone' such a positiOD for several 
reBSODI. ForemOlt among them II that SBPC II the only stade ... voice C Â· tÂ· 
tbat C8D -with the help of the Student Lobby- deal eHecUvely with the r I I CS 
Board of RegeDts and the state Leglalature. The eoUDCo baa proveD to be 
an effective advocate for student posltlo .. on maDY luues. OIl the local 
scene, It Is on record supportiDg funds for Third CoUege, Unit Two, a I nsenslÂ·tÂ·lve 
project dear to the hearts of mOlt UCSD students. . 

'lbe only thing the Coop would gain by supporting such a posldoD Is ' 
Increased separation from the other elgbt UC campaaes. 

Schneider also says the Coop hal beeD ln~reaslngly domiDated by one 
viewpoint-that of the faction wanting to aboUah SBPC. We agree, aad 
believe the Coop ideology to be Isolated from that of tbe bulk of UCSD 
students. 

U the Coop ever hopes to become what ita memben already wistfully 
claim it to be-tbe official student government-It must open ItseU to allow 
an students views, "conservative" "liberal"or "radical," not just thOle 
which meet lis satisfaction. 

UCSD Sports Program 
A rumor circulated UCSD late last year tbat the Ad~lsory Committee 

on Student Fee Programs plaDDed to ease some of Its money problems by 
eUmlnatiDg the intercollegiate sports program. FlmiUy, the committee 
did allot enough money so the program could continue, though several 
teams were eUmiDated due to rising costs. 

A thletic Director Judy Sweet will soon be presenting a proposed budget 
for next year to the. committee. Sweet will ask for B. t budget hllre part of 
which will cover iDcreased womens' sports travellDg costs, as they have 
been forced to play a majority of their games lD Â·tbe Los Angeles area 
beginning next year. 

We believe that UCSD students are proud of hoth our lDtercoUegiate 
and Intramural programs, and wish to see them continue. Only a brief 
look at the numbers participating Is needed to prove I,.

I will mention another inconsistency ol the ChanceUor's letter 
"charging" us to hold a campus wide referendum. He admonishes UI to 
follow Â·"our own rules", in hurrying up the election 80 88 to precede the ' 
10th week, and in the same letter charges the Board to hold an election. 

The inconsistency here II not that the CllanceUor baa violated the 
Elections Board Code of procedures but that he has charged the Board to 
action, which the Board, subject to its code, has no power to comply. 

We could of course amend the code. By ~ vote we could give ourselves 
or anyone else the power to call elections at will. I am against that 
alternative.

In our next article we wfll ex~

some twnon can eHectively resist 
the onslaught of chemicals and x-

exhibit certain characterlatics -

and glucose concentrations, - that

treatment.

It should also be remembered 
that cancer is not some monolithic 
entity - there are great many 
ldQds of cancer, and each will react 
differently to treatment. Talk of 
finding "a" cure for cancer is 
somewhat analgous to talk of 

I meeting "the" communist threat-
it implies a unity that does not 
exist, and tends to oversimplify the 
problems.

It should be understood that the 
mechanism I am going to present 
is, at best, controversial; the 
reader is 'cautioned to remember 
that much of this is still in ex-
perimental stages ol development 
and has yet to undergo estensive 
clinical trials on humans. 

It is necessary to begin with the 
generally accepted approaches to 
cancer therapy. Medical treat-
ments fall into three broad areas :

a few cases - 50 % of breast can-
cers can be successfully cured by 
surgery, bqt by no means all 
cancers are as easy to deal with. 
Successful surgery is dependent 
upon early detection, and is ob-
viously innefective In such non-
tumorous cancers such as lukemia. 

Radiation treatments are ef- McElroy ... 
fective ip a few cases, such as 
Hodgkins Disease, while other 
cancers are more resistent. The 
treatments typically call for 
relatively high radiation doses, 
and Is usually carried out in con-
junction with surgery and/or 
chemotherapy. 

The primary chemotherapeutic 
drugs fall into two broad 
categories, the anti-metabolites 
and the alkylatlng agents. Both 
attempt to c1isrupt the

tissues, and are mostefficacioua 

I ~o ~ough, strongly favor a referendum to elect a student government, 
for It IS necessary for the students to have representatives with real 
power to negotiate with the administration. No administrator should have 
the audacity to make a set of rules one year and then blatantly disregard 
them the next. I 

I would like to see all the people on this campus act in a more 
reasona ble manner toward each other, both students and administration.

We feel last week's dictionary 

definition of a triton did not meet 
our normally very high standards. 
Therefore, scattered throughout 
today's column you will find 
drawings and pictures of tritons, 
including the Triton reputed to be â€¢ 
relative of the god Neptune. Pleaae 

pick the one you like, and send it, 
two boxtops, and fifty cents in coin 
to DR. LlTTLEMAN, Triton TImes 
in the Student Center .. You woo't 
win anything bJit if we don't get 
enough questions by Wednesday at 
3:00 at least the money will make 
us feel better. 

Dear Doc: Your answer re: 
Innsmouth, Mass. was Quite 
wrong. However, I cannot tell you 
about Devll's Reef because "C' 
and the Deep Ones won't let me. 
For more information see the 
NECRONOMICON by Alhazred 
orhg4r. 

Dr. Llttieman: 'I found this in the 
typewriter of my friend, Ward 
Phillips, who bas been missing for 
three days. Do you know wbere be 
Is? 

Here is a drawing of the S-4 
submarine we correctly reported 
last week as having been raised in 
1928 off the coast of Provincetown, 
Mass.: 

Last week's questioo was a little 
too deep for us. But we do know 
that the answer to your friend'. 
submarine question can be found in 
a story by H.P. Lovecraft entitled 
''1be Shadow Over lnnImouth," In 
wblch the People of the town of 
Innsmouth make a dark pact with ' 
the devllilh Deep Ones. 'lbe 
"Necronomicon" Is a mythical 
work suppoaedly written by Abdul 
Alhazred around AD 730. The boOk 
never really existed but .,. 
thought up by Lovecraft for him to 
quote from In bII storie.. M to 
what baa happened to your friend, 
we lunest you look for him in the 
land of Erewhom.

Third College 
Montrose 
Named New 
Assistant Dean 

by Laara Rkbier 
Staff Writer 

After am active years at UCSD, 
Susan Osborn Montrose baa been 
named the new Assistaqt Dean ci 
Third College. \ler interest in the 
College baa been made evident by 
her participation 88 counaelor in 
the Teacher Education Prosram. 
She is presently pursuing her M.s. 
degree in that field at San Diego 
State University. 

Cross-cultural environments and 
Third World activities occupy the 
majority of Montrose's energies. 
She has been an active member of 
women's groups, especially those 
in the corrununity. Her respon-
sibilities will vary. including 
organizing Third's Social 
Activities Program Board. 

Harris.. 
financially. his campaign cannot 
afford media saturation. his 
organization is noted for 
mobilizing volWlteers. In fact, his 
district Â· is saturated with the now-
familiar blue and orange signs 
proclaiming Harris' name and 
party affiliation. 

Although secretive about his 
organization 's current polling. 
Harris revealed that he may be 10 
to 15 percentage points behind 
McCloskey. Considering his odds 
17 months ago. he is improving. 

" Remember. I'm not supposed 
to win. " Harris sa id. But the 
politician in him surfaced when he 
predicted "We won't win this 
election until the last few days." 

Fees ... 
Association of State UniverÂ· 
sities. Despite lobbying efforts 
and demonstrations by students 
of the City University of New 
York- they could not prevent the 
imposition of tuition fees for the 
first time in 129 years. 

Increased apathy. feelings 
that there isn't much that can 
be done. and becoming ac-
customed to the ever-present 
spectre of inflation may be 
leading students to continually 
expect hikes. As an Iowa 
student leader warned. " it may 
be a sign of the times ... it's sad 
and scary."

OtlJer 
M eIQorab Ilia 
I challenged tbe ni&ht with my coUection Of Cbandler. 
Now it was day. and I felt as If I had gone tbroa8b a ceremonial 

initiation Into manhood. A JeltylVHyde tran8formation bad taken place, 
changing me fnm a mUd mannered reporter imo PIdlip Marlowe -
Raymond Chandler's sleutbe extraordinaire, the acid tongued, a.nI 
moving private eye. 

Grrrrr ...... 
I walked to the newspaper office and buried Dl)'8eIf in a .. per.r waited 

fora case. 
I found a woman. I decided that would do. _ 
Becky DeVinney. our Production manager and staff feminist, saun- . 

tered through the door. I surveyed her body. It didD't take any Phi Beta 
Kappa to realize abe was the kind rl cookie that Girl Scouts ne4er sold. 

" Hello. Alan," she said 
"The name's Marlowe." I re.plied. "I had a hard night. My Â·heart 

doesn't move without java. Find me some." 
She stared at me. astonished. I went back to reading Dear Abby. At last 

she scurried to my commands. I smiled - Marlowe smiled - behind the 
paper. Women were the same. whether it be in Chandler's 3O's or 
Russell's 70Â·s. _ 

She returned, almost kowtowing ... Alan ........ she started. 
"Phil." I said. waving my hand condescendingly. 
"HereÂ·s.you coffee. Phil." 
I didn't flinch as she threw It all over me. I should have. 
Wiping the scllldlng water from my eyes. I thought of Zeno, the founder 

of stoicism. and Chandler. the founder of hard private eyes. 
That determined me. I reached out and grabbed her, pressing the 

warm body close to my side. "1banks. I needed that," I said. "I like a 
broad who plays hard to get." 

She kneed me . 
Zeno be damned. I screamed.'A high pitched scream I may add. 
It's tough being a tough private dick. 

â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢ 
I awoke in pain. my head slumped In the " Help Wanted" section of the 

paper. That perked my interest to check and see if there were any 
openings for eunuchs. No such luck. There was probably a glut even in 
that market. 

I checked my watch. and found it was time for literature class. I 
minced my way there. It was hard ignoring the wfUstles. 

The pain was relentless. After seating myself in class and listening to 
the professor's lecture it spread to another area. "What would Marlowe 
do?" I asked myself helplessly. and then the answer came. 

Hipflask. It always worked. Several swigs of scotch and Marlowe was 
ready to tackle the world again. . 

I lifted the metal container and swallowed deeply. 
I retched. . 
The professor kept talking. 
I tried my distilled medicine again. And again. And again. I began to ' 

understand why Marlowe drank so much. I began to W1derstand the 
mysteries of the universe. I even Â·began to understand the professor's 
lecture. It was like a combination of religious experience and a highball. 

I was loudly humming the Battle Hymn of the Republic when the 
professor handed me back a paper I had written. I opened it up a page. 
and began to frown. My nicely typewritten paper had ugly red ink lines on 
it. Another page, more of the same. 

I swallowed some more scotch. and again became one with the cosmos. 
I began to chant a bawdy Irish hymn. I opened my paper to the last 

page and saw the B plus staring at me. At once, everything became clear. 
I W1derstood. 

"There is a conspiracy! "I shouted. 
The class shuddered. One token radical muttered. "right on." 
I was Marlowe. 
I was a hoWld dog on the trail. 
I was as drunk as a skunk.

The professor made some witty 

conunent about Plato and alcohol 
I replied with something that 
rhymed with witty. Then I at-
tempted to physically point out my 
B+ . Somehow I kept missing my 
mark. 

"What you see here," I said to 
the class, "is a B+. Somehow I 
always get a 8 pillS. I want to know 
why." 

The professor blanched. He 
began to move away. He !mew 
what was happening. 

I pointed to his cringing figure. 
" He is with 11IEM," I said. "A 
member of ... " 

"No." Interrupted the pralessor, 
trying to weasel his way out 
" Wbat you are saying is quite 
ludicroll8. In fact. Milton had a line 
to describe such behavior. Let me 
think jlllt a moment ...... 

"Shut uP. twit." I said 
menacingly, giving him a look that 
Marlowe would have been proud 
of. "I undentand everything now. 
54 straight 8+'s and I didn't see. 
Now I do. All of YOU will be CItÂ· 
posed." 

The little man paled. He licked 
his liPS. and saw no MCIlJ)e. He 
rasped ou\ a line from 
Shakespeare. and then, before I 
could react, produced some 
cyanide tablets and swallowed 
them.

Sweeps All-Cal Soccer 
bySeoU 
SportI 

Following a 3-2 victory over 
UOO in the oper.ing game of 
the competition, nationally-
ranked UCLA stutout ita ,.ext 
two opponenta to take tOp 
hooan in the All-Cal soccer 
tournament played this 
weekend at UCSD. 

Some two hundred spectaton 
at Muir field Saturday watched 
the Bruins beat a hard-working, 
but not nearly as individually 
skilled team from UC Davis, 2-
0, in the championship game. 

U~D, playing in the losers 
bracket because of its opening 
game loss, defeated UC Santa 
Cruz, 6-3, Friday afternoon, but 
we~ beaten again the following 
morning, 3-0, by UC Santa 
Barbara. 

In the UCSD-UCLA game, the 
Tritons gave the Bruins their 
closest match of the tour-
nament. Despite operating most 
of the contest without three of 
its s.tarters, UCSD played 
evenly with UCLA and could 
have beaten, or at least tied the 
Bruins with some better goal-
keeping. With Allen Cox, Carlos 
Ponte, and Warren Jacobs 
missing much of the game 
because of classes, UCSDs 

regular goalie, Doug 
Youngdale, was called on to 
play in the field. Two of UCLAa 
goals came on balls that looked 
from the sideline to be saveable 
by Youngdale's replacement, 
Hans Landell. 

Having one of the SUl8l1est 
teams, both in size and numbers 
of players, tbe TritOll8 looked 
tired and ragged in their 
Saturday morning game with 
UCSB. Despite a constant 
urging by .. istant coach Brent 
.,

Alfonso Gonzales and the late-
arriving Ponte scored UCSOs 
tw6 goals in the game. 

In their second game Friday, 
UCSD opened a 3-1 halftime 
lead over UCSC and coasted to 
their lone victory of the toW'-
nament. 

Thurston-Rogers to his team to 
"Wake Up! Wake Up!" the 
Tritons never did. 

UCSD returns to league 
competition this Wednesday 
with an away game against 
USIU. 

UCSD Evens Record with Badminton Win 
by Dave Cohen 

Staff Writer 
UCSO's badminton tea'm evened 

their record with a decisive win 
over Southwestern College on 
ThW'sday. 

The Tritons' record now stands 
at 1-1. The victory was marked by 

ov~rpowering play by the Tritons 
as Southwestern. was simply out-
manned, out-powered, and out-

Joe Staruish [IT photo: Bill Brooks) 
classed. 

Liz Noll, the Tritons' number one 
women's singles player, had 
trouble getting on track in the first 
game of her match but came back 
strongly to blitz ber oppqnent, 7-11. 

11-2, 11-1. Carol Steinberg easily 
handled her match in the nwnber 
two women's singles slot, 11-0,11-5. 

In the men's number two singles, 
Kent Schwit~ won the third 
game 15-5 to take his match. 

The match of the day was a hotly 
contested battle in the men's 
number one singles division. Joe 
Starvish had his hands full. His 
Southwestern opponent took the. 
first game, forcing Starvish to 
scramble after shots blasted with 
fierce velocity. But Starvish 
rebounded to take the second game 
and set the stage an exciting third 
and deciding game. Starvish had 
momentum going into the game 
and kept it. He tired his opponent, 
hitting the corners with deadly 
accuracy and dropping shots over 
the net out of his opponent's reach. 
In the end he had more stamina 
and poise and took the game and 

the match. It was a powerhouse 
match in every respect. Long 
rallies with amazing shots made 
the match a standout. 

In women's doubles, Jane 
Orbach and Lorna Watt battled in 
overtime to pull out an exciting 
victory in their first game but 
couldn't hold it together as a tough 
Southwestern unit pulled out the 
next tw.o games to take the match. 
Sylvia Franci and Rowene Estrada 
handled their opponents, 15-10, 15-
I, in the number two spot. 

Men's doubles action saw Gary 
Kreitzer and Phil Melese gain a 
well contested victory, 15-7, 15-10.
