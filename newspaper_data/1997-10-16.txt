UCSD Student Wins Scholarship 
Andrew Suarez, a doctoral candidate in biology, 

has won the Canon National Parks Science Scholars 
Program scholarship worth $75,000. The scholarship 
Will help finance university fees, field work and other 
research expenses. Suarez will receive the scholar-
ship at a dinner reception in Washington, D.C .. on Oct. 
22. 

The program's objective is to attract top graduate 
students to the fields of conservation, environmental 
sCience and park management. 

Under the three-year scholarship. Suarez will 
examille the vulnerability of native plant systems to 
non-native plant invasion at the Cabrillo National 
Monument. 

"I think It'S Important to understand what fac· 
tors facilitate the invasion of non-native plant 
species and what the detriments of their invasion 
are. " said Suarez . ' When native species are dis· 
placed, it becomes an ecological disruption not 
only to that speCies, but to non-related species, by 
cutting off a food source fo r animals, for exam· 
pie. " 

Suarez and UCSD biologist Ted Case recently doc· 
umented foreign ants infiltrating Caltforllla.

Nobel Prizes Do Not 
Indicate Superior Teaching 

Dr. Stanley B. Prll',iner. a member of the prestigiou, 
UC San Fr<lncisco facult y, wa, awarded the' 1997 
Nobel Prize in Medicine for hi s discover)' of "pri on'> ," 
a biological means of infection. 

Although we arc proud that Prusiner\ is the \ I st 
obel Pri ze awarded to a UC faculty member. the 

honor comes with a sour reallnllion . 
UCSD i, highl y ranked as one of the top research 

schoob. Amidst all the bras, plaque, and golden tro-
phics. however, we mu,t nOl lose sight of the fact that 
the uni ver.,i ty is an institution of learn Ing. The needs 
of the students arc often brushed aside to make way for 

profes~ors' research . 
Students of thi s university arc paying exorbitan t 

amounts of money to attend UCSD, yet arc finding it 
hard to learn from researchers who arc not nccessar-
i I Y the best teachers. 

The university needs to realize th at hi gh honors 
do not necessarily equal excellent teaching, and the 
best interest of the students should not be forgotten . 

Lack of Students on Team 
Shows Poor Planning 

La~t week, Chancellor Robert Dynes announced 
the 14 members of the UCSDK- 12 Pfl.!- Planning 
Action Team. The team is respon~ibl e for pl anning 
the implementation of the six recommendations of 
made by the K-12 Outreach Ta~k Fore '. 

The team members arc faculty and administrator~ . 
Notably missing from the tcam are any student s or 
staff members. I r t here were two ~llIde nt, and one 
'itaff memher on the original K-12 Outreach Task 
Force, why are they ahsent from this team? 

The reason for their absence, acco rding to 
Chancellor Dynes, is that the tealll 's recommendati ons 
arc pending thL: Acadcmic Senate's approval. 

Students and staff melllbers have always played a 
role in UCSD's outreach programs - from the Partners 
at Learning program. to trying to force the UCSD 
ChUlter School proposal through the Academic Senate. 

Since students and slarr alike have a vested inter-
est in diversity at UCSD. they should playa part in 
making the Outreach Task Force's report a success. 

If the chancellor and the members of the Academic 
Senate arc serious about including students and staff 
in this process, these vital parties must be included on 
the team.

'CASUAL' SMOKERS IGNORED IN 
THE DEBATE OVER SMOKING 

COMMENTARY: As the smoldering debate surrounding the imminent demise of 
the tobacco industry continues, casual smokers are left choking on the dust 
By Dan Streeter

It Is the unfortunate 
reality that occasional 
smokers are a distinct 
minority .•. Casual 
smokers' decision to 
light up Is based 
solely on pleasure. It 
Is difficult for 
someone to enjoy an 
activity If he thinks 
that he Is endangering 
others. 
never without some cvil to allack. If 
you think aoout it. ~ moking is almost 
the perfeci soc ial pariah.

People who smoke less than fi ve 
cigarelle, a day arc nOI cxposed to Ihe 
sa lllc health ri sks as someone who 
smokes a pack a day. 

Studies indicate that occasional 
smokers rai,e Iheir risk of heart diS-
ease and that the smoke docs damage 
Ihei r lungs. However, Ihey are nOI 
eXlrelllely likely to develop cancer or 
emphysema. The damning reports Ihat 
demonstrate the devaslating errects of 
smoking on Ihe body are based only on 
people who smoke at least ten ciga-
relics per day. 

This article 's purpose is not to 
encourage cigarelle smoking. It aims 
to open up the debale over smoking, to 
include the people who smoke because 
Ihey like to. If someone of legal smok-
ing age decides lhat he likes to smoke. 
and does not get hooked, then every-
one should just let him be. It is Ihat 
person's freedom and his· right.

Promise Keepers is one of Ihe

'Seven Years In Tibet' Fails To Live Up To Potential 
Proving he's not just a pretty face, Brad Pitt wants to be taken seriously in new film 

By BI11 Glanzman 
Staff Writer 

In an ideal world. every film 
that has a budget biggcr than 
Yugoslavia. and is more over-
hyped than the 0.1. Simpson trial. 
would completely fulfill all critical 
and popular cxpet:tatio n,. 
Unfonunately. thi s is definitely not 
a perfect world. and director Jean-
Jacque Annaud's " Seven Years in 
Tibet" ultimately fails to li ve lip to 
its ample potential. 

Initially. the movie , 1 arts out 
strong as it depicts how the selfi~h 
Austrian mountaineer Heinrich 
Harrer (Brad Pitt) sets out with hi, 
countryman Peter Aufschnaiter 
(David Thewli s) to win glory and 
fame by scaling one of the hIghest 
peaks in the Himalayas. 
Unexpectedly. World War II breab 
out and both men are quickly cap-
tured by the British and taken 10 an 
internment camp.

When Heinrich and Peter subse-
quently escape and begin an ardu-
ous journey toward freedom in 
Tibet. the tilm displays an epic 
quality and seems to promise a big-
ger-than-life adventure. 
Complementing this magical 
atmosphere is the gorgeous setting 
of breathtaking. snow-capped 
mountains and decp. rugged val -
leys. 

Nevenhcless. as soon as the two 
reach the Tibetan city of Lhasa. the 
~tory quickly loses its effective-
nes,. Though supposedly isolated 
from the world, far too many 
Tibetans arc hoth able and willing 
to speak to the Austrians in their 
native language and accommCldate 
all of their material needs. Despite 
their colorful attire and spi ritual 
enlightenment . the Tibetans are 
essentially one-dimensional. eard-
hoard characters who fad to elicit

of the classic fairy tale, but falls into 
the obvious trap of being sick and

"Sloaches Fun House," by Steve

Sickest Film Ever Made." and while 
that may be so, that doesn't make it 
a good film . Miles Thompson's 
"Hut Sluts." while si milarly crude

TREK: 
Where no man has

Continued from p .. e 18 
American and female officers 
wasn't commonplace in television. 
"Trek" changed that. 

In the most recent incarnation, 
"Voyager," the female captain 
Katherine Janeway commands a 
cast consisting of a first offi cer 
played by a Nalive American, a 
Vulcan Chief Security Officer 
played by an African American 
and a Klingon-Human Chier 
Engi neer played by a Latino. 
The Speclel 

In every episode of the original 
series the Enterpri se encountered a 
new species. With each successive 
year and series, alien species 
hecame more and more popular 
and prog ressively linc-tuncd . 
Eventually, each species came to 
represent a different aspect of 
human nature. 

Vulcan, were the lin,t species 
to achieve fame. By int roduciog 
thc character of Spock, "Star 
Trek" was ahle 10 study human 
nature from an ()utsider '~ perspcc-
tive . While Spock mad~ ohscrva· 
tions uhout hi s shipmate~ , he al,o 
'truggled WJlh hi, own humanity. 

"S tar Trek" has also treated 
artll'icial inte lligence a, a specie>: 
thi, includcs hoth androids and

The UCSD Guardian 

much like the Vulcans in that they 
study humanity in the hope of 
finding it in themselves. 

The Klingons represent a di s-
tinct subset of human behavior. 
They represent the furor of battle 
and the glory and honor of being a 
warrior. During the Cold War, the 
Klingons represented the Russians 
to the American audience. 

Romulans, like the Vulcans, 
strive for order but do so in an 
underhanded and deceiving man-
ner. While the Romulans haven 't 
been developed as far as most 
species, they reflect the distrustful. 
suspecting nature in humans. 

Cardassians are too much like 
Romulans to offer much of a dis · 
tinction. They mirror human 
nature III that they consider them -
selves the center of the uni verse 
mudl as we do today. 

The Fcrrengi arc laughahly the 
most reflective of our 1I10d.:rn 
American cu lture. Their endlcs, 
pursuit of profit mirrors the dri -
vi ng force hehind modern society. 
a concept found comical in "Swr

On thc coallaib of the ,uccess 

of "Star Wars," the first of the 
films reunited the original cast and 
introduced a retrofitted Enterprise. 

While the movie wasn't much

with significant improvements in 
special effects, it proved that there 
was a market for feature-length treks.

The next film. ''The Search for

With "Star Trek: Generations," 
the movie focus shifted away from

On The Run: Ewan McGregor (left) and Cameron Diaz discover passionate feelings for one another 
following a bank robbery in "A Life Less Ordinary." 

~ear(hing for 'A Life Less Ordinary' 
'Trainspotting'star appears in film noir 

By Undsay Harris 
Senior Staff Writer 

The customary blockbuster 
movies that flood the media and 
theatcrs often leave very lillie room 
for creative, independent films. 

However, an exception to thi~ 
all-too-familiar standard ha suc-
cessfully proven that there i~ a defi -
nite division between a movie and a 
film . The director/producer/writer 
team con~isting of Danny Boyle, 
Andrew MacDonald and John 
Hodge i~ rcsponslhle for off-kilter 
indie flicks such as "Trainspolling" 
and "Shallow Grave," both of whieh 
have garnered both nat ional and 
international acclaim. 

The team 's latest contribution to 

the world of filmmaking stars 
Cameron Dial ("My Best Friend's 
Wedding") as Cclinc and Ewan 
M cGregor C"Trainspott i ng") as 
Robert, two people who find them-
selves in search of "A Life Less 
Ordinary." 

A~ Roben pur ues his dream of 
publishing the finest trash novel 
ever while hulding down a janitori-
al position, Celine maintains on ly 
two concerns - shopping and 
Ccli ne. Aftcr being fired from his 
job, Robert kidnaps Celine, the 
daughter of his former boss. 

Their polar opposite bUI equally 
mundane existences become the 
business of two guardian angels, 
played by Holly Hunter and Delroy 

Lindo, who must make Roben and 
Celine fall in love. The heaven-sent 
assignment becomes a celestial 
chore as Celine and Roben stumble 
upon all kinds of chaos including 
an abduction, a compromise in a 
karaoke bar and a bank robbery, all 
of which i~ "supposed" to mold 
their two hearts into one. 

The role of Robert was tailor-
made to fit McGregor and his talent 
for portraying offbeat and dark 
characters. 

A screeni ng of "A Life Less 
Ordinary" wi ll be held next 
Thursday at 7:30 p.m. al the AMC 
La Jolla 12. Passes can be obtained 
from the Price Center Box Office. 
The film will open on Oct. 24.

Don't ~ay No To 'The House of Yes' 
Perversion and intrigue saturate bizarre plot 

By JIImI Lotar .. n 
Slaff Writer 

Mark Waters ' film "The House 
of Yes" invites viewers into the 
home of an affiuent Washington 
D.C. family living in its own 
bizarre version (or perversion) of 
the Kennedys' "Camelot." 

Waters has adapted playwright 
Wendy MacLeod's acclaimed 
stage play which lampoons the 
insularity of the upper classes. As 
the title suggests, the Pascal fami-
ly abode - the focus of the movie 
- is a home where anything goe . 

A fter years away from his 
eccentric family, the eldest son, 
Marty (Josh Hamilton), pays a 
holiday visit to his younger col-
lege-drop-out brother Anthony 
(Freddie Prinze, Jr.), mentally 
unstable twin sister "Jackie-O" 
(Parker Posey), and cunning 
matriarch (Genevieve Bujold). 

He brings his young fiance 
Lesly along - a character played 
with sweetness and naivete by Tori 
Spelling - introduci ng her to the 
strange web of family relations. 

As the Thanksgiving evening 

progresses, the tensions mount. 
Many and Jackie-O's willy sibling 
banter escalales inlo a recapitula-
lion of an incestuous rendezvous 
from their youth, involving 
Kennedy assassinalion role play. 

At the same time, Anthony 
seduces the very confused Lesly. 
The result is a love "rectangle." 

Audiences should see "The 
House of Yes" for its original dia-
logue, off-beat humor and surpris-
ing plot twists, and will leave won-
dering which character is really 
sane.

Whi Ie the Tritons did come 
away with another tournament 

champlOn~hip, it wasn't completely 
smooth ,ailing. 

"We struggled through most 
matches, making them a lot harder 
than they ,hould have been," senior 
scller Sherine Ebadi said. '·But il 
was great to see our team fighting 
even though we weren't playing 
our best volleyball."

wrong foot a~ it held olf the ho,t\ 
10 Win, 15-10. UCSD would ,how 
no mercy in the next two gamcs, 
,weeping the match, 15-4 and 15-3. 

Coming ofr it, win against 
SouthweMem, UCSD entercd thc 
Trinity Invitational Tournament 
looking to dominate the two days 
or matche, . Despite the Southern 
ho.,pitality they had received. none 
01 the Tritons ' oJ1ponents would 
roll over and concede a win to the 
ladies from San Diego. 

The Tritons opened play 111 the 
Mx -team tournament by faCing the 
College of SI. Benedici. Struggling 
to )!deout and get m own llffen~e 
working, UCSD dropped the fir~t 
game, 15-5. 

Not wanting tbe match to ~IIp 
away, the Tnton~ looked to sopho-
more out;,ide hiller Allison Bender 
to plt:k up the slack . Bender 
respondcd Immedialely and UCSD 
ro lled over SI. Benedict I n the sec-
ond and Ihird games. After lOSing a 
well -fought fourth game, the 
Tritons showed tenacity by dosing 
out the match with a 15-9 win in 
the ~ fth game. Bender finished the 
maleh with a team-high 21 kills. 

··We never give up - game-
point in the fifth game; it doesn ' t 
matter how far down we are," 
Ebadi said. "We always have the 
notion that if the game is not over 
we can still win." 

The struggles that UCSD faced 
early against SI. Benedict was min-

I X, he ripped a huge shot which the 
Trit()n~' keeJ1cr. Lucas Curtolu, 
made a great attempt on, barely 
gdtlllg hi~ fingertip~ on the hall . 
The hall ,till got pa,t 111111, howev-
er, ,lI1d appeared on it~ way Ill. But 
hi, ~nger1ips ~ent the hall just a III-
tie higher and miraculously, thc 
hall hit the cro,shar. 

·'We saw Trinity, who ended up 
not Winning a match and gelling 
beat much worse than they should 
have. J1lay tremendou, when they 
J1layed u~:' McFarland said. "We 
had the feeling that our match was 
the only one in the whole tourna-
ment thut they seemed to cure 
about:· 

In their third match, the Tritons 
faced the 0.5 ranked sq uad from 
Wisconsin-Whitewater. Once 
again, Bender stepped up her level 
of play a\ did freshman Leslie 
Punelli. Following the lead of these 
IWo, UCSD overcame a first game 
loss to sweeJ1 the next threc. 

The final match of the tourna-
ment proved to be the easiest for 
thc Tritons as they rolled over 
Blu/Tton College in three games. 

While UCSD proved that it is 
capahle 01 J1ulling together a sirong 
team cflort , Bender and Punelli 
took advantage of the time in Texas 
to shine individually. Bender 
proved that shc w~ capable of t:ar-
rying the offense and Punelli 
proved invaluable with her passing 
ski lis. Both were named 10 the all-
Tournament team as the Tritons 
brought home the ~hamJ1ionship. 

With a solid showing in Texas 
where thcy proved that they were 
able to win despite not being at top 
form, the Tritons pass through the 
midpoinl of the season with the 
hopes of improving on the NCAA 
Quarterfinals birth that the team 
made it to last year. 

The Tritons travel north to face 
Division III rival Chapman on 
Friday. 

Zamorano had an impossible-to-
miss (we thought), open net inside 
the 6. But unbelievahly, he some-
how got under the ball and put it 
over the cros,har. 

Thc collective sigh from the 
Triton bench and Ihe stands was 
remarkable. 

With every try for a goal seem-
in!! to he Ih~ la,t , the Hawks' 
Callos Calderson look the hall JUSI 
inside midfield and pushed toward~ 
the Triton net. From ju!>( outSide the 

It wa~n ' t ovcr yct. The rehound 
landed on the cleats of the Hawh· 
Aaron Zamorano. The situallon 
was exactly like the one which 
completed Sleder's goal, as 

So the Tritons made out with a 
2- 1 vit:tory in a dramatic fashion.

about having stayed home to listen

lowed. If you've got any kind of a tennis game, this toumament is for you. Different divisions 
for diHerent skill levels. There are Men's divisions, Women's divisions, and pet divisions. If 
your piranha In the fishbowl over at Tioga can hold a racquet, we've got a division for it. 

The entry lee for the !Wo-day evenl is as simple and economical as it gels. One new can of 
Penn or Wilson tennis balls will do the trick. For your trouble. all players will be scheduled for 
two consecuhve matches on Saturday (October 25th). Vou can play In the morning or after-
noon to make it convenient. II you win one 01 Ihose matches we IIlVlte you back the next day
