Odd-Even Rationing Ggmes to San Diego 
By Katby Huffer 

Associate News Editor 
An emergency gaso1ine 

measure was made effective in 
San Diego County at midnight 
last night which appears to 
have gas retailers confused, 
and which may not prove 
surricient in preventing a nve-
day strike by area gas stations 
next week. 

California Governor Brown 
approved the state-wide 
allocation plan ye terday . 
lIllowing each county to restrict 
gasoline sales to odd and even 
dates if necessary. In addition, 
he rejected San Diego County 
Supervisors ' request to be 
exempted from violation 
penalties which could cost 
offenders up to $500 and/or six 

months' imprisonment. 
The emergency plan . 

implemented only once before 
in California during the 1974 
Arab Oil Embargo. should 
" slow down the panic bind" 
most area gas station have 
encountered the past week. 
according to Greg Smith . 
assistant to the County 
Supervisors board of directors . 

Motorists with an odd-
numbered last digit or only 
letter on their license plate 
will be the first to use the new 
plan today and will be uble to 
purchase gas only on odd-
numbered date for an 
indefinite period of time. 

Even-numbered dates will be 
limited to motorists with an 
even last digit on their license 

plates and to vehicles with no 
pcrmanent n.'gistration. The 
31st of each month will be open 
to all motorists who wish to 
po rchase gasol ine. 

The new plan allows for 
exemptions of several 
cutegorics of vehicles , 
including emergency, out-of-
state. hundicupped-operated, 
commercial and ervice 
vehicles . Motorcycles and 
mopeds are also permitted to 
purchase gas on any day . 

Gus tations official in this 
area were uncertain of the 
plan's requirements and. at 
lea t in the CSD vicinity. full 
implementation of the plan will 
not be completed for at least 
several days. 

Ben Vigil , owner of a Ch~vron 

station in University City. said 
his station will not adopt the 
restrictive measures because 
he does not want to limit sales of 
a deillyed gas supply he will not 
receive until Friday and 
because the plan "is voluntary 
anyway. 

According to Smith, how-
ever, the plan is mandatory 
for all stations in the county. 
But he added that the county 
will not actively enforce the 
regulations . relying instead 
upon the cooperation of area 
gas stations and motorists . 

. 'To enforce it would be 
extremely difficult," Smith 
explained. " You can't have a 
heriff at every gas station." 
The emergency measure 

require all gas stations in 

affected counties to sell gas to 
only appropriate odd- or even-
day motorists. In addition, 
stations cannot sell gas to 
vehicles with tanks more than 
hal( full . 

When asked if his station will 
check all motorists' gas 
gnllges, Del Mar Exxon station 
owner Mel Domiano 
responded ... Are you kidding?" 
Although he has encountered 
few "violent" customers 
during the recent gas crunch, 
"You have that one idiot who 
will knock you dead" if forced 
to display his gas gauge, 
Domiano said . 

Although the gas restrictions 
are hoped to reduce the long 
lines which nave occurred at

Only Six Percent Vote as 
AS Elects Another Four 

Ignored by almost the entire 
student body, the AS runoff 
elections produced four more 
winners in races for AS 
commissioner positions. 

Only six percent of the 
student body turned out on a 
cold, windy day to choose its 
representatives and complete 
the profile of next year's 
student government. 

Steve Schreiner, a distant 
second in the election two 
weeks ago, came back and 
deCeated Cindy Biondi to 
become commissioner of 
communications. Schreiner got 
286 votes, &4 percent of those 
cast. BiondI. who earlier 
declared her support for 
Schreiner, got a 36 percent 
share. 

Marcos Ortega, Corced into a 
runoer after a hair's breadth 
victory in the Cirst election. 
received 72 percent of the votes, 
and whipped Terrell Chafin, 
who got only 28 pel'cent, 121 
votes. He becomes pro-
gramming commissioner. 

In the only closely contested 
race, Bruce Napell edged 
Zephyr Goldsmith to become 
elections commissioner . 
Napell. who resigned from the 
elections commission to 
become an eligible candidate, 
got 203 VOles. 53 percent. 
Goldsmith, who ilas been in the 
African country of Sierra Leone 
ince the beginning of the 

quarter, polled 186 votes, 47 
percent. 

Jon Bekken, running 

unopposed to become student 
welfare commissioner, re-
ceived only 52 percent of the 
ballots cast in his race. Arturo 
Herrera. a write-in candidate, 
got 100 votes , 27 percent, and 
other write-in candidates 
picked up the remaining 78 
votes . 

Bekken was allowed to run 
with no opposition after Jane 
Toggenburger, who won the 
first election for the commis-
sionership, withdrew because 
of grade problems. 

The only proposition on the 
ballot, which called for a 
democratically elected UC 
Board of Regents, received the 
upport of 79 percent of those 

voting, 15 percent less than .1

Stu~ent May Sue 
Campus Police 
Alleges .Harassment by Sergeant 

By Jon Goetz 
Staff Writer 

Lee Lehman , a UCSD student 
who was hit by a campus police 
car earlier this year while 
riding his bike and sub-
sequently won a $1350 
ettlement for injuries incurred 

in the accident, is now 
considering suing the uni-
versity for pOlice harassment. 

Lehman sued the Regents for 
$3000 in lost wages resulting , 
from the February 13 accident. 
University representatives 
settled with the Third College 
senior April 13 for the lesser 
amount. Lehman, a con-
struction subcontractor , 
sprained his wrist in the 
incident and could not work for 
six weeks. 

Lehman claims to have been 
mistreated by Sgt. Clark 
Martin, the officer who backed 
into him . Martin , stopped 
eastbound at the intersection of 
Miramar Road and Meyers 
Road, backed up from the stop 
sign to enter the right turn lane, 
and in the process, hit Lehman. 

After the collision, Lehman 
and his " mangled" bicycle lay 
on the ground south of the road. 
The version of what happened 
afterward varies drastically 
with the officer's story. 

" The first thing (Martin) 
asked me was, 'Do you have a 
license for this thing? ' . He 
should have taken me 
immediately to the health 
center," said Lehman. "The 
first priority should have been 
my health , not whether my bike 
was licensed." He claimed that 
his arm was bleeding and that 
his wrist had become 
discolored at that time. 

Martin doesn't remember the 
afternoon's events that way. "I 
saw abrasions on his arm. 
There was no blood. 1 don't 
remember anything wrong 
with his wrist," he said. 

" He refu ed treatment ," the 
officer continued. "I had to 
convince him that he needed it. 
I felt I couldn 'tjust let him walk 
off. I felt he was in shock then." 

Lehman charged the officer 
with refusing to an wer his 
questions about why Martin 
backed up on the street. Martin 
replied that he didn't answer 
because he didn't want to admit 
liability, and because he was 
trying to calm Lehman. 

. 'He said he had to know why I 
backed up. It was like an 
obsession. I was convinced that 
was a sign of shock. I was trying 
to calm him down. He was in a 
fighting mood ," said Martin. 

Lehman also charged the 
campus police with hara ing 
him in the months following the 
accident. He claimed th at 
Martin once followed him down

Tenure 
Teach-in 
Tonight 

A teach-in on the tenure issue 
will be held tonight at 7 in 
Building C of the Student 
Center. 

The event was planned to be a 
"consciousness-raising" ses-
sion and organizational 
meeting as part oC a campaign 
for tenure demands. 

The list of demands printed in 
the new indicator Extra 
announcement for the teach-in

Abortion Advocates 
Ignore Fetal Rights 

Editor: 
It II intereatiq to obIerve 

that advocates of abortion, 
luch as Role Scozzaro, never 
once mention the fetus In their 
discussion of the abortion issue. 
You will hear much laid about a 
woman's right of choice and 
about the problems women 
would have to face if they were 
required to carry each child to 
full term. And if these were the 
only thlqs involved in the 
abortion issue, I too, as a 
woman, would support abortion 
one hundred percent. But this is 
not the case. 

Since Rose Scozzaro 
emphasized the rights of 
women in her letter, I would 
like to point out that unborn 
women have rights, too. Dut I 
have yet to hear a feminist 
admit tbis. In any case, 
whether the fetus is male or 

female, healthy or unhealthy , . 
wanted or unwanted, it is a 
unique human being and a 
defenseless human being, and 
we should not lake upon 
ourselves the role of God in 
deciding whether or not we give 
permission to the child to live. 
Rose Scozzaro asserts that 
abortion on demand is health; it 
is certainly not health or life for 
the fetus . 

Carryi"g an unwanted child 
to full term is a very difficult 
task. Bul abortion is not an 
issue of convenience, as much 
as you and I would like it to be. 
Unfortunately, abortion is the 
taking of the life of another 
human being. The mother's 
right of choice over her own 
body must be secondary in this 
life and death matter of the 
child's right to live.

GSC Concerned About 
Development Proposal 
Dear Chancellor McElroy 

The Graduate StUdent 
Council Is seriously concerned 
about the Brittany Village 
project and its recent approval 
by the Campus/Community 
Planning Committee (C/CPC) . 
It appears that the proposed 
project will have a significant 
negative impact on a large 
number of graduate students 
living in the Mesa Apartments, 
across the street from the 
project. 

The Council feels that the 
project is short-sighted and not 
in harmony with the best long-
range development of the 
community surrounding the 
University. In particular. the 
GSC questions: 

I) the desirabilit.y 01 a three 
hundred room hotel and the 
traffic generated by the 
presence of the hotel. 

2) whether safe passage of 
pedestrians and bicycles along 
and across Regents Road can 
be assured with a predicted 
3000/. increase in road traffic, 

3) the complete lack of any 
guarantee of rental apartments 
or appropriate private housing 
for low-income groups , in 
particular. students and stafl, 

4) the destruction of the 
natural barrier between the 
Mesa Apartments and the 
University Towne Centre, and 
the ecological impact of this. 
. A special note is that item (I) 

is not in consonance with the 
reduced life style required in 
the next 2Q-40 years as our 
energy resources dwindle , 
while item (3) runs contrary to 
desperately needed student and 
stall housing within bicycling 
distancp. of campus.

Zionist Leader Says Mid 
East Peace Will End ure 

By Dr. Arthur Hertzberg 
Pacific News Service 

(Dr. Arthur Hertzberg, president of the American 
Jewish Congress from 1972 to 1978, is vice president 
of the World Jewish Congress. A professor of history 
at Columbia Unil.Jersity, he is the author of Tlte 
Zio.Jat ,,,_ and of the forth coming Bein§ 
JftII;'i i .. A.mea. He is also Rabbi of Temple 
Emanu·el i" Englewood, New Jersey.) 

According to conventional wisdom, the peace between Egypt and Israel is doomed to failure because it is built on 
the fragile pillars of weakness and fea r. 

Certainly the latter half of that statement is 
incontestable. But what the conventional 
wisdom has never accepted is the equally 
indisputable fact that peace in the Middle East 
has never been made by the strong. 

When America had power to burn, it 
regarded the MiddJe East as a side show and 
refused to invest the energy that was required 
to push either Israel or Egypt to the peace 
table. It was only when President Carter stood 
at Ihe brink of diplomatic failure that he wa 
able to trade efrectively on the weaknesses 01 
both Israel and Egypt to forge an agreement. 

President Sadat ' s weakness was the 
knowledge that he might fall from power soon, 
unless he could give his people some glimmer 
of hope. The' peace has achieved that. For tens 
of millions of Egyptians today, there is at least 
a vision of a better future. especially since 
American aid will be lorthcoming in much 
larger measure than belore. 

Sadat's weakness spilled over onto Begin. He 
could not aHord to be charged with the fall of 
Sadat, either It home in Israel, or in America. 
Moreover, the economic situation in Israel, 
with inflation running at over 60 percent a 
Y aI', is such that, as an Israeli cabinet 
minister said to me the other day at brunch, 
"The very eggs we are eating depend on the 
Americans_" 

In the last stages of the negotiations, when 
there was some monetary lear that it would 
fall apart, Washington talked of abandoning 
both Egyptians and Israelis to the.ir fate, and of 
finding ways to defend the Saudi 011 fields 

without either of them. or even without the 
Saudi . Obviously. the Ameri can government 
was afraid {)f a Middle East swept further by 
Iran-style insta bility. To avoid so cheerless a 
prospect wa worth the billions in additional 
aid for Egypt and Israel. 

Will this peace last? It definitely will. The 
po sibility of large-scale milita ry action by the 
Egyptians against Israel is now removed. An 
open border does not lend itself to effective 
secret mobilizations of the kind that preceded 
the surprise attack of the Yom Kippur war. 

For the next three to five years, even if the 
cast at the lop changes , Egypt and Isnlel will. 
at worst. be hurling statements a nd not bombs 
at each other. 

Peace. even a grudging peace. traps the 
major forces in the Middle East. despite 
themselves . into dealing with the West Bank. 
The history of the last 30 years is that of an 
Israeli-Arab war every six to 10 years. The 
aftermath of war, or a rising tension toward it. 
repeatedly made it possible to put off the 
Palestinian question . Now. almost six years 
after the war of 1973. there is peace tension. 
rather than a rising war tension. Short-run 
games may and will be played around 
American election time next year, or in 
preparations for Israeli elections the year 
thereafter. but they are side-shows. The 

' meaning of the Egyptian-Israeli peace. 
regardless of how one parses the verbiage in 
the documents. is that the West Bank and the 
Palestinians are inevitably next on the agenda. 

General Dayan, Israel's foreign minister. 
who has always been at least six months ahead 
of everyone else. has already declared (and 
suffered only mild reprimand from Begin) . 
that peace cannot be made without the 
particiP<ltion of the Palestinians. He very 
clearly meant to include ilt least major 
elements oCthe PLO, and he is preparing Israel 
fol' such a prospect. 

Three weakened politicians huve mad!! an 
ilgreement. which now has il life of its own. 
Despite their rhetoric. and th!!ir quotation and 
re-quotation olthe prophet ISiliah. this peilce is 
short on ideals and long on pragmutism

Due to a $1 ,75 m illion university budget cut, fall quarter 
regist ration packe ts wer not ma il ed out a nd continuing 
,unde rgraduates will have to pick them up at th e lnternationCl I 
Center e ith er tomorrow or Friday. 

Pa cke ts will be llva ila ble in the I nte rn ationa l Center, loca te d 
on Hutchin on Way (Warren Campus), between 9 am and 3 pm. 

Enrollment week wi ll be May 2 1-25, Registration cards will 
have to be turn d in as follow s: Seniors-May 21 , Juni ors-May 22, 
Sophomores-May 23 a nd Freshmen-M ay 24. 

St ud ents may have to wa it in line a t the [nternational Center 
in order to pi ck up Ul e ir Registration pack ets , but at leas t they 
wi ll not have to suffe r the " inhumane" sys tem of " gymnilsium 
regi'lra tion " pmcticed a t many othe r co lleges, said UCSD 
Registrar Ron Bowker yesterday , 

tud ents at San Di ego State Uni vers ity . hc sai d, h ave to s tand 
in line a ll day because they regis te r for each class se parate ly , 

Bowker sai d t he deci ion not to ma il packe ts to continuing 
undergraduates "wasn't a dec is ion we wa nted to m ake," 

Bowk er ex pl a ined that the Ad ministration, in th e face of the 
budget decrea c, told Regi tration two months ago it would 
have to cut back. Since postage accounts Cor "one-third of the 
operati ng budget" of Regis t rati on , " it seemed nece ary" to 
reduce co t. in thal a rea, according to Bowke r, 

Bowker expressed the hope , talked a bout " off a nd on for 
a bout 10 years" by UCS D admini strator , th at ma ilboxes cou ld 
be m a dc ava ila bl e Cor o Cf-campus s tudents, which is 
a pproxi mately 60 pe rcent oC the tudenl body. But Bowker has 
no answer to th e problems of w he re so many mailboxes could be 
s ituated on campus, how they wo uld be m ai nta ined, nor which 
departme nt would be responsible for them .

By .John Klock 
Senior Siaff Writer 

After placing seventh of 15

offs last weekenrl. the SD 
intercollegiate sai ling team is 
left looking toward next ye<Jr. 

" I'm pretty pleased." Mark 
Folkman. coach. aid of the 
weekend's effort, "considering 
we ' re going to have everybody 
back next year. This year we 
just got our boats and got 
everything together ," 

"Nex t year we ' re really 
going to show 'em ." he 
promised. 

They a lmost didn 't make the 
l()-hour drive to Berkeley for 
the regatta , 

" We were sitting here, trying 
to make up our minds whether 
to go, We were afraid we 
COUldn't get gas . Finally we got 
two five-gallon jugs of gas. and 
just went. We actually used 
them once." Folkman said, 

First place overall for the 
regatta was taken by UCLA , 
The top two teams, chosen on 
their record in 12 different 
races, qua Iified for the national 
c hampionships, Folkman said 
UCSD left before numerous 
protests were settled. so he

or Long Beach State took

Folkma n skippered the A 

boat to a fourth place overall 
with six races ranging from a 
second to a t welflh place finish , 

High winds. such as those at 
Berkeley last weekend. have 
given the ailing team trouble 
all ea on. so they were ready 
with heavier crew members 
this time. The strategy may 
have backfired, 

" We got the twelfth place in 
the first race. I used someone 
heavier than the crew I was 
used to, but we weren' t too 
organized," he explained. "We 
took on some water ," 

By contrast, Folkman almost 
won one race. "We got a real 
good start, and we were leading 
through the whole race. Just 
after the last (tum) marker 
another boat turned inside us 
and the wind ..,ddenly 
changed, which allowed them 
to pull ahead. They won by 
about three feet." 

In the B group, Barney 
Barrett skippered to an eighth 
place finish , with Karen Butler 
for his crew. Crewing for

'Silent Partner' 
Is Inoffensive, 
Quiet Picture 
E ven the staunchest of Agatha Christie aficio-

nel do will find The 
Silent Partner a major 
disappointment in terms of 
providing mystery u nd 
suspense. For the ave rage 
viewer desi ring an occasional 
thrill or two. howeve r' . this 
motion picture has more th<Jn 
its share of excitement. 

The plot is a charming cat 
and mou e caper between mild-
mannered bank teller Mile 
Cullen and sa distic robber/ 
rapist Reilker. Their' battle of 
wits is intermittently dis rupted 
by Miles ' amorous encounters 
with chummy co-worker Julie 
Carver and Reilker's seductive 
accomplice Elaine, an odd 
co upl e wedding, and an 
uncalled -for mutil at ion 
murder . Overall , ' the movie 
goes at a somewhat mdhodical 
pace with an ending that has an 
extre mely close call with 
melodrama . 

Elliot Gould is endearing as 
Miles Cu ll e n . His facial 
repertoire ranging (rom boyish 
smiles of innocence to wide-
eyed bewilderment are as 
comical as his dramatics of 
keeping one step a head in the 
game are ingenuous. While Su-. 
sa nna h York reached new 
heights in her Kryptonian role 
as Superman 's mother, it is 
certainly pleasant to see her 

come down to earth ageli n as 
Julie Carver.

Science 

Med School Aims to End Birth Defects 
By Doug Campion 

Science Editor 
ot all birth defects are the 

res u It o fan un fortun ate 
combination of genes. some are 
caused during pregnancy . 
These defects are targeted for 
elimination by the UCSD 
Medical Center. 

The San Diego Co unty 
Teratogen Registr y at 
University Hospital supplies 
information to pregn a nt 
women , health professionals 
and counselors about possible 
defect-causing agents. 

Formally in operation since 
September, the Regi stry 
primarily receives calls from 
concerned parents, according 
to Resea rch Coordinator 
Christine Kelley. Physicians 

German Measles a Common Cause of Defects 
and nurses make up the 
remainder of the calls . 

" To our knowledge there is 
nothing like the Registry 
anywhere else in the country," 
said Kelley . 

Teratogenic agents are those 
materials which can cause 
malformations in the fetus or 
embryo if a pregnant woman is 
exposed to· them. The list of 
s uch agents is diverse , 
including not only infectious 
germs a nd viruses , but also 
co l1mon substances like 
alcuhol and nicotine. 

Rubella , orGerman measles. 
is a common cause of birth 
defects . Pregnant women 
exposed to this disease may 
give birth to children with heart 
defects, cataracts or hearing 
disabilities . 

Although data concerning 
effects on humans is lacking, 
experiments show that Valium, 
a tranquilizer and the most 
prescribed drug in the country, 
does aHect the development of 
animal fetuses . 

The Teratogen Registry 
gathers data from callers 
concerning exposure to specific 

a gent during pregnancy . 
Combi ning their knowledge of 
the effects of various 
substa nces on the developing 
fetus with the information 
supplied by a caller, Registry 
staff members attempt to 
assess potential results . 

By exa mining infants about a 
month after birth, the full 
extent of exposu re can be 
determined. 

According to Kelley, "There 
are some things that may not be 
apparent until school age, but 
right now we' re pretty busy 
keeping up with the others." 

Previously all information 

about the possible causes of 
birth defects was gathered 
after the child was born. This 
method relied heavily on the 
memories oC the parents about 
expo ure to teratogentic 
agents. 

About 80 histories have been 
collected so far dealing with 
pregnant women who have 
been exposed to the agents. 

According to Kelley, the 
Registry receives calls from all 
over the country . Other 
registries do exist, she noted, 
but they only deal with 
particular agents. 

After a slow start training 
sta ff members a nd organizing 
data , the Regis(ry began to get 
a response. Now, said Kelley, 
the staH receives up to 17 calls a 
day. 

Must Breast Feeding Be Taught? Sailors Cross the Seventh 
Nature has to take lessons too. 
One of the most natural of a ll functions . a 

mothec's breast feeding of her infant, has to be 
taught, . a.ccording to Dr. Audrey Naylor, 
professor of community medicine and 
pediatrics a nd director of the 
Lactation Clinic a t the UCSD Medical 
Center . In addition to nursing mothers, over a 
hundred community physi cia ns , nurses , 
dietitians, a nd other health care workers have 
attended the clinic as observers as well as the 
Medical Center 's own staff involved in 
maternity ilnd infant care. 

"Breast feeding used to be learned by future 
mothers and future phy icians when they were 
chi ldren and watched their own mothers or 
older sisters nur ing babies ," says Dr. Naylor. 
" But during the last few generations, breast 
feeding was 'out' a nd the knowledge was lost. 
Now it has to be consciously learned." 

More th an 520 felmilies have taken advantagf' 

of the Lactation Clinic program since it opened 
in September, 1977. Visits include complete 
examination ofthe infant, breast'examination of 
the mother , observation of breast feeding 
technique, and other nutritional a nd social 
service consultation as needed. Some 320 
families have used the twenty-Cour-l1our 
telephone consulting service. 

Since breast fceding appears to be more 
successful when prospective pa rents are 
informed about it, a monthly two-and-a-half-
hour class is held from 7 to 9: 30 pm forexpect.ant 
mothers and fathers . The next classe are 
chedu led for Apr il 11 . May 9 and June 6. 
The lactation program at UCSD Medical 

Center is believed to be unique at the present 
time in the United Stales. 

The American Academy of Pediatrics states 
that during th e first four to six months of an 
infant's life, breast milk will supply virtually a ll 
nutrients the child requires.

Although he expects great 
things next year, Folkman 
conceded the team had only an 

.outside chance before the 
regatta of qu a lifying for 
nationals. " If all our people had 
showed, and everything had 
gone right, we might have 
made it." 

No UCSD sailing team has 
gone to national,S in over five 
years. 

The team missed two recent 
regattas because of lack of 
interest, both in alt ernate 
categories . One was in team 
racing, which allows a school to 
enter more than one boat a nd

stations recently , at least so;ne 
local station owners'. plan to 
participate in a nation·wide 
strike to be held from May 18-
21. 

All major stations which are 
dealer-operated ha ve been 
asked to join the strike by the 
Dealer 's Association , ac-
cording to Ron Smith, owner of 
a Shell station in La Jolla. 
Nearly all stations in his area 
plan to strike, he said. 

Nine other counties joined 
San Diego County in approving 
the allotment plan, including 
Los Angeles, Orange"Merrin, 
Ventura and San Bernadino 
counties, according to a 
spokesman from the Office of 

Emergency Services . Four 
udditional counties arc 
expectcd to adopt the plan by 
next Monday . he arlded. 

The allotment plan also 
requires gas stations to 
indicate its gas supply situation 
by displaying one of three 
C1ags : green to show gas is 
available to odd- or even-day 
motorists: yellow to indicate 
that only emergency vehicles 
may purchase gas: and red 
announcing that gas supplies 
have been exhausted and the 
station is closed. 

Several r etai lers are 
skeptical of the potential 
success of the restrictions. 
"Odd or even. it doesn't make 
any difference," commented

Domiano . cxplaining that 
dri\(j'!rs will pay little heed to 
the regulations . 

But Smith is confident that 
the plan will succeed. Most of 
the phone calls he has received 
from county residents have 
been in favor of the restrictions. 
and "with conservation. there's 
enough gas." he said. 

Despite whatever effect the 
plan will have on gas lines. 
some retailers in this area do 
not anticipate increa ed gas 
supplies in the near future . 
Although they will sell gas only 
during restricted hours. most 
stutions will remain open daily 
only for servicing and repairs. 

According to the new 
allotment system. retailers can 

'ell no more th an twenty 
gallons of gas to a custonwr. 
But except for the "hulf t'.IJlk " 
I'cgulmion. sUltio ns ca nnot 
impose uny minimum purchase 
I'cquirements. 

Furthcr , retailers must 
manuge their fuel supplies '0 
that gas will be avai lable 
through the month . 

No one is quite sure how lon~ 
the restrictions wi ll last . and no 
clearly defined goals have been 
set for the plan. But the system 
will be implemented at least 
" until the situation worsens or 
gets better. " Smith remarked .

The Registration Fee 
Committee has unanimously 
approved a new design for next 
year's Intern Program which 
will establish advisory 
committees in key student 
services. 

The change in structure, 
which provides liaison services 
between Student Affairs and 
Reg Fee, will create advisory 
committees for Student Health 
Services, Financial Aids, 
Counseling and Psychological 
Services, and University 
Events. 

The new plan was submitted 
to Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Richard Armitage, who 
is expected to rule on it 
sometime in the next two 
weeks. "I'm familiar with the 
new concept, but I would like to

" It is our belief that an active 
and viable advisory committee 
is essential for each unit, " said 
Ma ry Anne Rodgers . this 
year's Intern Coordinator. 

The advisory committees 
will serve as an information 
gathering body , an improve-
ment that will allow the interns 
more time for the detailed 
analysis of structures and 
budgets for each service, 
according to Rodgers. 

"I would like to see each of 
next year's four interns chair 
an advisory committee," said 
Rodgers. 

The proposed design is based 
on a pilot program carried 
out this year in Student Health 
Services headed by former 
intern Lisa Pieper. " The

program was quite successful. 
I don 't see any reason other 
services can't do the same 
thing," Rodgers remarked. 

The new tructuring will al 0 
allow for an $800 savings over 
last year's Intern Program 
budget by eliminating a 
salaried ombudsman now 
chairing the Student Health 
Services advisory committee. 

Interns have been active in 
UCSD's budgeting process for 
three years by doing analytical 
research on student services ' 
budgets a nd structures, 
interviewing students, meeting 
with fa'cully and adminis-
tra tion and presenting their 
findings · to the Reg Fee 
Committee. 

Applications for next year 's 
Intern Program will be made 
ava ilable at the Reg Fee Office 
in the next two weeks.
