Herbert Kunzell, 
chai rman of the UCSD 
Board of Overseers, said in 
a recent interview that he 
expects the board to have 
"considerable influences in 
areas that are public 
relations and business." 

He said that the board 
will not have and "shouldn't 
have" much influence on 
academic policies . 

Chancellor William 
McElroy appointed the 39 
member group which 
consists primarily of i n-
flue ntial business and 
profeSSional people from 
an Diego, last fall. In an 

earlier Triton Times article 
(2/8/ 74) McElroy said the 
boa rd was formed to 
"advise and assist in the 
Uni versity's continuing 
deve lopment ." 

The purpose of the board, 
according to Kunzell , is "to 
help the administration in 
an advisory capacity on 
matters pertaining to the 
fisca l policies of the school 
and in its relations with the 
community ." . 

Right now, Kunzell , said, 
the board is " just learning" 
about its job and 
"becoming oriented into 
the operations" of the 
campus . In the two 
meetings the board has had 
so far, he said, they have 
been learning about future 
pla n~ at the un iversity and 
have discussed some ideas 
to' present to Chancellor 
McElroy. He declined to 
ta lk about the ideas, 
however, saying that it is 
too early to make the 
board 's views public. . 

Several campus officials 
were asked to comment on 
the Board and to answer 
some of the questions 
about its purpose and the 
extent of its influence that 
have arisen since the Board 
was first publicized. 

Lee Burke, sophomore, 
is the only student on the 
board . She sees the group's · 
role as an "attempt to erase 
ome of the lines" 

separating the university 
and the surrounding 
community . Recently, Ms . 
Burke stated she has 
discovered that many San 
Diegans view UCSD as 
"Snob Hill" both because of 
its location and its 
academic reputation . She 
fee ls the board can help to 
change this impression . 

Ms . Burke also stated that 
the board will give the 
university a chance to get 
community input . She said 
this is important because 
the university faculty and 
students may hear only one 
side of an issue otherwise. 

The Board of Overseers 
are "really advisory people" 
she feels, and cannot have a 
direct influence on 
university matters . In-
directly, however, she said 
that the "Chancellor will 
listen very hard" to their 
comments and advice 
before making his own 
decis ions. 

While Ms, Burke feels her 
presence on the board is 
"definitely token" she said 
that she will take the 

initiative to. assure that she 
has "real input" into board 
decisions . 

Botti Burke and Kunzell 
said that while it is not the 
object of the board to act as 
a fund raiser for UCSD, one 
indirect benefit to the 
university might come in 
the form of monetary and 
material contributions from 
the board members and 
their acquaintances . 

Paul Saltman , Vice 

hoard will not have a great 
influence on the day to day 
policy making of the 
university, but that they will 
be able to "generate ideas 
from a different per-
spective". 

Unlike Burke, Stewart 
does not feel that UCSD has 
a bad image in the com-
munity . He said that it is 
not a matter of improving 
our image but rather of 

projecting our true image . 

Stewart said that the 
board could also be a big 
help to the university when 
the Mandeville Center 
opens . He stated that the 
board could act as "a 
magnet" to draw com-
munity support for UCSD 
functions and activities. 
Kunzell agreed that the 
board might be of help in 
this area .

Chancellor of Academic 
Affairs, when asked the 
purpose of the board 
replied, " McElroy was 
anxious to accomplish 
several purposes" in 
developing the Board of 
Overseers . He outlined 
three functions as he sees 
them, 1) to enable a

Coming in the wake of a seemingly unsuccessful

hope to submit more than 520,000 signatures to the 
state registrar by April 14. Burke said that only 450,000 
are needed; the larger figure accounts for the ineVitable 
ineligible signatures . 

Only California residents who voted in the last 
election, or who have registered since the most recent 
elections in their respective areas , can sign the 
petitions . The marijuana drive was hampered by a 30 
percent ineligibility factor. 

Operating under the auspices of the tate Full Right s 
. Initiative Committee. the drive has already obtained 
200,000 signatures under tlte leadership of Robert 
Closson and Jerry Stare, UC Berkeley students who have 
quit the movement. The present leaders , accor~ing to 
Burke, will center their efforts on the 600,000 university 
and co llege students at institutions sou th of Fresno 
whose enrollment is 3,000 or over Further ignature 
will be obtained during spring break at the end of the

working grassroots in the LA area ." 

Burke aid the drive is backed by Secretary of State 
Brown the Tavern Owners Association (which is 
providing office space and phones), the Young 
Republicans, the Democratic Club, and recognized as a 
"valid student concern" by the UC President's Council 
and the UC Student Lobby . "There are only two groups

Woman's Temperance Union," Burke said . 

USIU: 'Trouble, oh Trouble Set Me Free ... ' 
by John Taylor 

United States International University, whose central 
campus is on Pomerado Road 10 miles east of UCSD, 
would like to greet the 1974-75 academic year with an 
end to the troubles that have plagued it for the past few 
years . It's been tough, and everyone at the private, 
multicampus university seems afraid to be too op-
timistic about the future just yet. _ 

The first of a two-part 
series, which will .be 
concluded, rather abruptly, 
on Friday. 

The USIU admissions department is hopeful, though-
it has prepared a slick, three screen slide pre~entation , 
with dramatic, soaring voices and music . But at a recent 
screening for students, more than a subdued murmur 
broke out in the audience at mention of USIU's "ex-
cellent facilities ." After the showing, the host of the 
meeting, USIU Human Behavior School Dean N. Ray 
Rucker hastily explained, "None of the students who see 
this show will be here until next year," and further 
mentioned the extensive building plans for this summer, 
which now, a week and a half later, seem to be meeting 
with problems.

seven professors against 
USIU president William 
Rust. The suit culminated a 
period of relative disen-
chantment (in some circles) 
with Rust, and a period of 
extreme uncertainty for the 
future of the university. 

USIU, formerly a 
Methodist-owned school, 
was placed in the hands of 
Rust, a Methodist minister, 
in the early 1950s. The 
president has si nce earned a 
reputation as ' financial 
wizard' by accumulating 
2400 acres of land for the 
university (with campuses 
in San Diego, Hawaii , North 
Africa, Colorado, Mexico, 
and Great Britain), usually 
by acquiring the debts of 
the school that owned the 
land previously Building 
from the former Cal 
Western College on Point 
Loma, all the additional 
campuses were obtained 
without any r .. al cash 
output. The total 
enrollment on this acreage 
is about 5000 (th e 
University of California 
educates, proportionally, 
135,000 students on the 
same amount of land). The 
school's catalogue indicates 
that the limited enrollment 
is an educational ad-
vantage, but most admit 
that more students would 
be very nice, and that the 
adverse public ' ty USIU has 
received lately isn't helping 
any .

Computer Screening 
For Cancer Drugs 

A revolutionary 
tec hnique for screening 
prospec tive anti-cancer 
drugs, in which details of a 
drug's molecular structure 
are used to predict 
therapeutic activity, has 
been reported by chemists 
at the ~awrence livermore 
Laboratory and the 
Univers ity of Washin~ton . 

The technique, a highly 
sop histicated form of 
co mputer analysis, 
prom ises to become a 
major asset to h eavi ly 
burdened drug screening 
programs . Thousands of 
n w compounds thought to 
have potential anti-cancer 
applications are tested each 
year . 

The value of the com-
puter screening technique 
will be to es t ab li sh 
priorities, not to eliminate 
lab testing, according to the 
chemists , Drs . Bruce 
Kowa l ski and Charles 
Gender . 

They say the technique 
proved 93.5 percent ac-
curate in screening 200 
prospecti ve anti-cancer 
drugs for their weight 
inhibition effects on solid 
tumors in small animals. 
This accuracy figure refers 
to the technique's ability to 
place drugs in "positive" 
and "negative" categories 
of a standard National 

Cancer Institute testi ng 
system . ((All 200 drugs had 
been tested previously 
under NCI auspices, so the 
computer's output cou ld be 
checked against actual 
laboratory findings .) 

The drugs were purine 
and pyrimidine nucleoside 
derivatives, a class of 
compounds that in the past 
has produced several 
substances of clinical in-
terest. The tandard NCI 
test was C A755 
(adenocarcinoma), in 
which a drug causing a 
tumor weight loss of 70 
percent or greater is 
considered "positive" and 
eligib le for further testing . 

A report on the work was 
published in the February 6, 
1974 issue of The Journal of 
the American Chemical 
Society. 

The Lawrence livermore 
Laboratory is operated by

University of California President 
Charles J. Hitch recently returned 
from a multi-week tnp through Asia. 
At the February meeting of the Boaa 
ofRelJents, Hitch commmented bn"efly 
on hzs travels, and those comments 
appear below. 

As you know, I just returned from a trip 
around the world in 35 days, stopping in 
about one dozen countries, all but one in 
Asia. Everywhere I went I found 
tremendous interest and tremendous 
concern about the energy crisis, which , 
of course, is hitting some of these 
countries much harder than it is the 
United States. 

My first stop in Asia was at Karachi , 
Pakistan . We arrived after a long flight 
from Athens at 2 a.m. I was met by a 
representative of Pakistan, who handed 
me my program for my five days in 
Pakistan . He said among other things 
that the Pakistan Administrative Staff 
College, which provides training for high-
level civil servants and foreign service 
officers, " has invited you to talk to them 
the day after tomorrow on the energy 
crisis ." I said, 'Who me? On the energy 
crisis?" I was prepared to talk about 
various things, but I had not expected to 
be called upon to talk on the energy 
crisis . 

Well, we got to bed about 3 a.m.; the 
phone rang very early the next morning 
and the Director of the Administrative 
Staff College in Lahore said, "We want 
you to talk on the energy crisis. You only 
have to talk for an hour, then answer 
questions for an hour." I thought about it 
and decided that maybe I did know a 
little something about the energy crisis, 
and so t agreed to do it • 

It was a very interesting experience. 
They were putting through a new group 
of foreign service officers who had been 
selected from all walks of life . When 
Pakistan lost Bangladesh - half the 

country - they al~o lost half of their 
foreign service officf'fs Hut they 'itill 
have as many embassies and consu latE''> 
to staff, and they decided to proceed to 
select a lot of promising candidates and 
put them through a crash four-month 
course before giving them a slgnment 

The students impressed me as a very 
able group, they certainly are able In 
speaking and understanding English I 
gave my talk . During the question period, 
one of the younger members of the staff 
present got up and asked questions , and 
he said, " Sir , you referred to controllE'd 
nuclear reaction as one of the Important 
possibilities for the future ." He said, " I 
wrote my PhD thesis on controlled 
nuclear reaction , and I think so, and 'iO , 
and so about controlled nuclear reac-
tion ." Well, fortunately what he thought 
was very much what I had learned to 
think from my second-hand sources from 
the University of California 

We went on and visited other ASian 
countries and ended up in Japan , where t 
found almost everyone with whom I 
talked - and I talked With many people· 
profollndly pessimisticabout the future 
of the Japanese economy because of the 
energy crisis and because of what they 
thought it indicated might happen With 
other raw materials as well , which , of 
course, they have to import In vast 
quantities . Despite all thiS concern. 
however, and all the hindering that was 
going on all over Asia , I did not find 
anywhere that any really constructive 
thinking was going on abo!..!t alternatives, 
and how they could cope with these 
problems which they foresaw 

I think it IS fair to say that In the 
University of California we have been 
thinking about energy problems and 
have been doing the research on energy 
problems and related sublects on a 
substantial scale for some time, and we 
are therefore in a position to build on 
that experience and that strength and do 
much more, as we will have to do and a 
we want to do, in the future

Keith Kapland and Wally

first team posted a 1&-6 . 
victory despite the loss of 
Dug Beanan for the season 
due to a very minor surfing 
accident . 

The UCSD women 's 
rugby club, the Syren, 
scrimmaged after the first 
game. At this point, the 
Syrens, are desperately 
looking to relieve their 
frustrations of not being 
able to find an opponent 
willing to meet them . 

Three other women's 
teams are emerging but so 
far are unwilling to risk life 
and limb in a game with the 
UCSD women . The 
scrimmage was most im-

mastered the fundamentals

working on improving their

most f"njoyable and

Tritons warmed up: The

nip and tuck after that. 
Chilly Warren kicked a 
penalty award to start the 
scoring for UCSD John 
Berteaux and Bill Meister

Berteaux did his thing and 
wound up with four points

Mountain Ron Uyeda was 
inserted into the scrum, in 
the econd half and what iI 
difference that made. 

The Triton scrum out-
powered the Snoids for the 
rest of the game due to the 
strength of Uyeda . Heads-
up play by the UCSD scrum 
gave the Tritons a short-

Burke scored a tryon a five 
year scrum . The Loyola 
Snoids quickly came back 
with a try to make the final 
score, 14-11 Snoid victory. 

Next week the Tritons 
take on a tough Irvine Coast 
team at UC Irvine .

Jock Course, Part II 

II UNTITLED VI 
by Mark Liska 

I n our last episode we 
were making preliminary 
explorations into the life 
and good times of a jock. 
Fate has decided that now 
be the time to conclude our 
two part adventure into 
wonderland . 

The next topic to be dealt 
with is social drinking or 
more precisely, the jock's 
habit of social drinking. A 
typica l, all-American jock is 
usua lly never separated 

from his beer on Friday, 
Saturday and any other 
night that seems to be 
fitting . Many a man has 
discovered the distressing 
consequences of separating 
a jock from his beer. THat 
kind of action smacks of 
stupidity, as much as trying 
to roll George Foreman in a 
dark alley or telli ng Wilt 
Chamberlain that he is 
pretty funny looking to his 
face . 

It's important to 
characterize exact ly what 

Triton Sur fers; 
Past to P resent 

The UCSD Surf Team has 
been around since 1966. 
Over that period of time 
many exciting and hilarious 
things have happened to 
the team and its members . 
In 1966 UCSD won the first 
WISC National Surfing 
Championship. At that time 
the Team was led by the 
new, legendary " Big Wave 
Rider" Ricky Grigg . The next 
three years new teams 
entered the WISC and old 
ones improved, but among 
all this improvement, UCSD 
(who eemed to be living up 
to their nickname, "The 
Tritons" ) was always up 
near the top. Not much 
mor is remembered about 
Ihat period of time as 
surfers and their records are 
l ike the changing ocean 
wave . 

around a fire with mucho 
cervesa and friends who 
surfed with yOU during the 
day. 

This year's format is a 
combination of past and 
present ideas. Again , the 
team consists of twelve 
contestants and six 
alternates, but this year, it 
will be offered as a class . 
There will be a ten team 
league with some of the 
contests being held as 
overnight trips. Teams with 
the best records will go to 
the nationals. Also, on this 
year's schedule is the AII-
Star Contest which will be 
held at K55 in Mexico. This 
annual contest has become, 
the trip of the year. Not 
only are the top six 
members of each team 
invited down to compete in 
the contest but the trip is 
open to all persons on the 
competi ng team 's cam -
puses. 

Last year's trip found four 
hundred people lying in the 
un, surfing hot eight' foot 

waves, rocking to music 

type of beer the jock shoeld 
drink. The most important 
type of beer is free beer, 
that blessing from the east. 
Any time the jock can get 
free beer - i.e . that greatest 
of all socia l gatherings in 
the world, the kegger - no 
matter what type of beer it 
is - it is the best beer. 
Assuming you bring your 
own, of course, it's im-
portant to have the correct 
merchandise to be looked 
up to . Be sure not to get 
anything too expensive -
such as Heineken or 
Michelob. This is a luxury 
reserved for special oc-
casions, such as winning a 
championship or getting 
married . Buyi ng an ex-
pensive beer is a bozo no-
no , especially for the 
begging or desiring jock. 
When an established jock 
catches somebody drinking 
fine beer he immediately 
thinks he is being imitated 

'or impressed, neither of 
which is a very good thing 
to do. 

Conversely, it is im-
portant not to drink cheap 
beer either . The $1 .00 a tall-
six pack just doesn't go over 
too well and besides, you 
just might as well drink 
water or som e other such 
unenjoyable substance. No, 
for the true jock, look to the 
middle of the road beers -
perhaps some Coors or Bud 
suits your fancy - they're 
pretty popular with the big 
boys - or maybe some 
Olympia or Hamm's if you 
like bears and running 
water commercials . 

The next point to touch 
upon is how and when to 
drink your beer The second 
part is easy, any time that 
two or more jocks get 
together is a good enough 
time to drink a beer and 
have a good time. The best 
possible times to drink are 
at the most hallowed of all 

jock events - the ever-Iovin' 
kegger . At a time I ike this 
the beer runs free, the 
laughs run heavy. the 
mouths run rampant as one 
jock tries to top another 
with his fi ne array of past 
experience and substantial 
victories, and the women 
stand in awe and all have a 
good time. The premium 
keggers are in celebration 
of an event such as a 
contest pitting jock against 
jock (i .e., the rugby team 
and their continuing series 
of battles) or a marriage. 

The other point we are 
touching upon is how to 
drink the beer. The im-
portant point here is to be 
creative . Try different 
things to make your 
drinking even that much 
more enjoyable Of course, 
the classic contest of 
masculinity is a chug-a-Iug 
between two jocks . These 
types of confrontations are 
the h ighl ight of a jock 
gathering and enhance all 
beer drinker's enjoyment. 
It's important to be able to 
hold your beer also. Ac-
cidents are tolerated, but 
not condoned 

That's it for today folks -
go out and grab a beer and 
have a rousing good time 
tonight 

1970-73 saw a new era as 
( on tests moved from a 
highly competitive serious 
nature to a more fun and 
enjoyable level, reflecting 
the ideas and attitude of a 
new generation of surfers . 
UC D was sti II l1P at the 
top, but th apathy toward 
competitive contests was 
beg inning to show. More 

~ u rf trips and fewer contests 
~eem d to be th direction . 
Days of wetting down hair, 
tuc king It under one' s 
(o llar, and occasionally the 
amateur barber at the 
border to Mexico became 
common occurrence . The 
tri pS were totally insane 
with days being spent on 
pmpty waves and nights in 
places such as Hussong's or 

and drinking beer - all-in- ____ -::: 
all , the world's greatest get-
together . This year's trip 
prQmises to be even better. 

If you are interested in 
the team or in this trip, 
there are ign-up sheets in 
the Physical Education 
Office. The trip is ,-:;--. 
scheduled for March 29 
through 31 . Even if you r-: __

PAUL REID 
DIInce: Jim Shipman 

USIU Modern Dance 
A free modern dance concert was offered last week 

by USIU's School of Performing Arts . The program was a 
collection of short pieces which were choreographed by 
the students as their quarter "term paper" . The evening 
was quite enjoyable. despite a relatively small and 
unenthusiastic UCSD crowd . . 

A technique demonstration preceded the actual 
concert. in which the entire company we"t through 
their "warm-ups'·. These exercises were developed 
primarily by Martha Graham (with variations taken from 
the work of Merce Cunningham and Jose limon) and 
form the common pool of movements which the 
choreographers put together to create "a dance". But 
even though the movements are essentially the same in 
each dance. the students have arranged them in such 
unique ways. with some original patterns included. that 
the viewer qto never be bored . The Graham method 
used by SPA provides for infinite variety. a fact which 
was beautifully demonstrated at their concert . 

Thematic work dominated the show. ranging from a 
couple of love triangle interpretations (including a 
Lesbian relationship). to a cocai ne trip (with Laura 
Nyro's "Poverty Train" as music). to a fine com-
munication of a feeling we all get sometimes : one of 
being utterly boxed-in . This was by no means the whole 
show. but I don't wish to second-guess the other 
choreographers . As we all know. there is oftentimes a 
great discrepancy between what the artist is trying to 
convey and what the viewer. or critic. actually sees . AliI 
can safely say is that I thoroughly enjoyed the program . 

Of special note was a long piece by master's student 
Marilyn Glattly called "PaHeming". Nine dancers 
performed admirably under the stress of extremely 
complicated timing sequences and Harry Partch's rather 
strange music. The dance. which took Ms. Glattly five 
months to choreograph, reminded me of doing difficult 
marching band maneuvers or singing "Row, Row, Row 
Your Boat" in the round- where everyone is doing the 
same thing only in staggered time . I was very impressed 
with it. 

The entire concert came off quite well . The music was 
well-chosen for the movements, with selections from 
Charles Lloyd. Deodato. War. Pierre Henry. Joe Sample 
and others . The company made maximum use of 
costuming and simple props. All the dancers exhibited 
grace and vigor. Although they weren't exactly Greek 
Bacchantes in an ecstatic state. it was apparent that 
they wj!re certainly having fun! 

The directors of the company- Claire Wolchinsky and 
Jean Isaacs- deserve some prai se (and maybe some Alka-
Seltzer) for prodUCing a symmetrica l program: it's not 
easy 'to do when Some of your dancers are in more than 
one piece and need rest in between . They can also be 
proud that several of their students are clearly destined 
for the professional ranks. 

I look forward to seeing this group again next quarter.

small. The dance group is pretty new, having been 
formed in 1970 by nine dancers heavily influenced by 
Merce Cunningham and following through on principles 
such as freedom and mutual improvisation. The only 
thing grand about the performance Friday night was the 
wobbling continuity of the dispersion among the 
performers which doesn't sound like much but probably 
is difficult to maintain; and it is even more difficult to 
keep it creative. evocative and entertaining. There is no 
head choreographer or lead performer; there is no 
writer . There is no hysteria. no ontology; the performers 
are not objects and they are not machines . Routines. 
which by now have become traditional through 
repeated use over the last ten years. are the only or-
dering elements and they are simple and open in time 
and space: jogging around the perimeter of the dance 
floor. falling on or a'gainst mats. pulling oneself up on 
chains. cuddling under mats ; they occur simultaneously 
or successively with the participation of from one to all 
of the performers with less or more concentration. 
coming out of the blue. going on for a time. being left 
off or continuing as other events occur among other 
performers. Almost out of nothing else to do the signal 
goes to the record or tape player at the side behind the 
audience. and on comes a rock or soul tune and the 

performers more or less or not at all respond to the 
rhythm and beat of the canned music. Sometimes the 
resort to the top 40 is pretty desperate and corny but it 

- adds life to the ~rty anCf the performers have no rules 
or prohibitions about what must be included or ex-
cluded f rom their thing . And it is their thing. there is no 
guru; they work entirely within im provised interaction. 
the focus being shifted nonchalantly to singles. or pairs. 
or combinations of separate activities. The members 
move or jerk or drift in or out of minimal, simple 
structures suggested by the space. sounds. props. 
costumes. the location of the spotlights. bright ideas or. 
more often. silly comments. 

Performing in this loose. almost cocktail party 
manner calls for sympathy and alert communication 
among all the members; a mutual trust and acceptance 
so that the orientation can be not only through eye and 
habit but also through weight and touch as they close in 
and leave off in relation to each other. If one performer 
gains the spotl ight or highlight for awhile it is by mutual 
tacit consent or indifference on the part of the others. 
On this particular night. a pert. tough little number with 
not much of a torso but an expression like the moon 
came on strong while the oldest member of the-group 
gave up pretty early and later merely sat on the sidelines 
to watch. The performance ran itself down into a boggy 
mix of elongated skits and parodies which were corny or 
facetious so that the evening ended on a dull thud as a 
spotlighted dancer withdrew through a door in mock 
romantic fashion . There are a thousand performances in 
the third city . Friday night was one of them.

TO make an intelligent 
evaluation of world events 
and their ca uses. a 
prerequisite to deciding to 
advocate one form of 
governml"nt over another. 
one must at least have some 
knowledge of what is 
happening. rortunately, 
due to our " free press". this 
knowledge is available to 
the diligent. Most people. 
however. do not avail 
themselves of this in -
formation. which is 
probably why it is allowed 
to exist. Since the reader 
has of necessity 
rationalized daily events to 
himself. the following quiz 
will enable him to judge 
how deep his knowledge is. 
and hence how intelligent ly 
he was able to make his 
decisions . This naturally 
reflects on his own in-
telligence. 

Score 20 points for each 
( orrec t an wer. so that a 
perfect exam merits an IQ 
of 160. Score 12 points for 
each an wer of (d). so that 
total ignorance, but an 
ability to read and follow 
directions (as well as an 
award for honesty) merit~ 
an IQ of 96 . Score 8 points 
for each incorrect answer. 
~ lOce then the reader has a 
g ro s mi sco nception . 
demonstr ati ng a dangerous 
ability to be brainwashed .

When I applied to the 

Univer ity. I was intrigued 
by the academic 
specialization of the in-' 
dividual campu es. but at 
the same time. by the ocial 
benefit each college ie. 
Muir. Revelle. Third. had to 
offer. As a Revelle student. I 
am trongly opposed to the 
intentional "social 
isolation " of Muir Co llege . I 
am refefring to the 

Simultaneous dances held 
by both Muir and Revelle 
on Saturday. Feb 23 . Upon 
arriving at the Muir 
Commons. I was surprised 
to find that their dance was 
closed to non-Muir 
students . I was informed 
that in order to attend the 
dance I must possess a room
