Do yo II lllink that low-income 

housing will have to be kept 
aW(JY from the beaches because 
of the value of the land? 

No. I think that we need to 
have a balanced community 
approach. I would not call it 
"low-income" but I would call 
it affordable. If you look at my 
record , you see some of the 
projects that I have pushed 
through the cit y counci l. and I 
h elped create affordable 
housing in the Sports Arena 
area , which is ncar Ihe beach. 
There are projects of afforablc 
housing being built there for 
sentors and families. I was the 
lead person on the cit y council 
pushing that idea and there is 
affordable housing near the 
beach because of that.

Utterly incongruous and 
lacking in austerity 

By PAUL FARWELL 

Injustices of much greater 
magnitude than the Niki de 
Saint Phalle culpture - "The 
Sun God" - probably occur at 
UCSD all the time. The 
problem. however, is that the 
de Saint Phalle 'culpture -
albeit only a minor injustice-
happens to be a very. very 
vis ible injustice. 

Simply take a walk down 
the pathway from the Muir 
campu', and you are certain 
not to mis, it. Scaling the 
heights of a cement archway, 
"The Sun God " looks like a 
combination of pre·Columbian 
and Sixties psychadelic pop 
art. The effect is, needless to 
say, startling. The sculpture 
has in fact already created a 
certain amount of sensation on 
campus, garnering such 
comments as: 'It looks like 
Ronald McDonald with wings' 
and 'It's a day'glo dinosaur.' 

All of the e sentiments. of 
course, lead to one conclusion: 
the deSaint Pha lle sculpture is 
an eyesore. The problem stems 
mos t ly from it s chosen 
location - next to the Applied 
Physics and Mathematics and 
the Muir Biology buildings, In 
comparison to such au tere 
and imposing structures like 
AP&M, "The Sun God" looks 
utterly incogruous . And 
although this effect is 
probabl y the creator's 
intention (or at least the 
intention of the members of 
the Stuart ColleCllon and 
campus administrators, who 
chose its location), Its impact 
seems lost somehow. 

Thi s. of course, is not an 
attack on art or the intentions 
of art. After all. the incogruit y 
of de Sain Phalle's scu lpture 
may be an artisically 
legitimate "ta temenl. But the 
real issue here is not the 
arti st ic success of "The Sun 
God," but rather what purpose 

our buildings and installations 
serve, And it ' hould be stated 
- mos t of all - that our 
campus grounds are not a 
forum for art ist ic experi· 
mentation . Scu lpt ure of "The 
Sun God 's" nature certainly 
has its place in the world. but 
this place i not on a grassy 
knoll on the Muir ca mpus. 

There is nothing wrong, of 
course. with building which 
serve a function and are 
beautiful a t the sa me time. 
Central Library certainly 
serves thi' dou ble f unct ion. 
But d e Saint Phalle' s 
sculpture ha ppens to bea work 
of art which Intends to convey 
something other than beauty. 
And thi is unfortunate. For if 
more works of art like "The 

un God" are introduced here 
UCSD face the threatofbeing 
transformed from a beautiful 
austere ca mpu:, to a mere 
object of curiosity. 

Parking 
Editor: 

The parking ·Ituation at 
Th e Guardian has always been 
difficult. however the problem 
is getting worse. There are 
only ten "permit" spaces in 
the tiny lot, and all hough 
there are always a high 
number of "B" permits 
occupying the "S" lot , things 
are pretty bad when nineof the 
ten spots are taken by "B" 
cars, leaving exactly olle space 
for some deservi ng ~tudent. 
There are numerous other 
parking areas in the relative 
vicinity where leaving one's 
car for an en! ire eight hour day 
will inconvenience a few less 
people. Let me have a fair 
chance at gelling some free 
parking too. please.

Letters to the Editor 

Try a little less knee-jerk outcry 
Students should pay for their education 
Editor : 

I'd like to offer a few 
comments on the issue of 
s tudent fees, in respon ·e to 
thejan. 31 letter submitted by 
the Third College tudent 
Council. 

The authors mentioned that 
$42 million (about 60 percent) 
of the $72 million state budget 
cut is directed at the UC and 
State University systems. The 
implication is that thi s 
percentage is unfairly high; 
and to be sure. 60 percent does 
seem reat her excess ive. But 
t here is really no bas is 
whatsoever for s uch a 
judgment without further 
fact s; unfortunately none are 
supplied . The answer to one 
question in particular is 
essential: what percentage of 
the s tate's total budget do the 
university systems consume? I 
think it 's clear what kind of 
light this figure wou ld shed on 
the matter. The 60 percent 
figure is practica lly meaning· 
less without it. 

In any case. the assertion 
that "60 percent of the deficit 
is being funded by the 
students of higher education" 
is valid enough. But it might 
help clarify things a bit if I 
point out just hoUi students 
will fund their 60 percent : they 
will have to begin paying (to a 
greater degree) for things they 
are now getting more or less 
free, 

Whether or not they should 
have to pa y is. of COUffie, 
anot her question. In fact. it is 
the central question to the 
ent ire fee issue. What puzzles 
me is that no one seem:, to 
w ant to add res it. [n theTCSC 
letter. as In other things I' ve 
read and heard on t he matter. 

an answer is presupposed; but 
there's no indication of how it 
was arrived at. ConSIdering 
the importan ce of the 
question. this ommission 
hardly seems excusable. 

In their letter, TCSC 
members urged students to 
write to legislators and 
present their " inability to 
pay" as an argument against 
fee increases. Many legislators 
will undoubtedly take t his into 
account. But the truth is that 
from the fact that someone 
cannot afford to pay for 
something, it does not follow 
that it should be handed over 
for free. If this tenet were 
generally accepted. I could go 
on quite a shopping spree. 

I realize. of course, that we 
are dealing with a specific case 
here - that of education. But 
unles ' you accept the validity 
of a general principle, you 
can't infer out of thin air it s 
truth in any specific case. 

So if the membcrs of the 
TCSC believe that students' 
inabi lity to pay for their 
education reli eves them of the 
obligation to pay for it, well 
fi ne. But if they want to use 
the idea in a statement urgi ng 
s tudent s (and ultimately. 

legislators) to act. it would 
make a more credible 
argument if they would just ify 
their belief and explain why 
they don't think students 
should have LO pay. 

After students have 
informed the legislature that 
they cannot afford higher 
educat iona l fees. they are 
encouraged to "suggest that 
the only way to balance the 
budget is with a lot tery or a tax 
increase ..... Everyone, I hope, 
knows that this is a lie. There 
are lots of ways to balance the 
budget. One of t hem involves 
w hat we all fear: fee increases. 
Another is to simply cut out 
few things from the universi · 
ties' shopping lists (if things 
are as bad as everyone seems 
to agree they are. do we really 
need a new sw imming pool?) 
Anot her is to eliminate other 
state expenditu res (reduce the 
60 percent figu re). 

/'11 assume that the TCSC 
members are awa re of t hese 
options, and don 't really want 
students to tell u ntruths, and 
then what they really meant 
was that the only "fair" or 
"acceptable" way is through a 
lottery or tax. Once again . t hey

are floating on an as umption 
that i n't anchored to 
anything. It is clear that they 
belie e their suggestions to be 
the only acceptable ones. But 
they don't say why they 
bel ieve it, why ot her t udents 
hould believe it, or why the 

legislator should believe it. 
Why are the alternatives I 

mentioned unacceptable. 
\\hile the various taxes listed 
by the TCSC - oil severance, 
tax. sin tax. sales tax -
perfectly OK? Why is it wrong 
to make students pay for their 
education, and right to make 
oil compan ies, or gasoline 
Uf.ers. or smokers foot the bill? 
Before Judging which 

alternatives are better. or 
fairer, or more acceptable, 
these kinds of questions really 
should be an wered . 

It might be that the TCSC 
authors imply don't care 
about these things. and are 
merely trying to appeal to the 
sentiments of the many others 
who already agree with them 
.But anyone, no matter how 
right or how wrong. can appeal 
to people's sentimentf.. The 
advantage in being right is 
that you can appeal to their 
reason as well. There are a 
number of possible explan-
ations for the fact that the 
TC C, in its leller. didn't even 
take a stab at doing so. 

My intent is not to pick on 

the TCSC: and it wouldn 't be 
fair to its members if I didn't 
point out that no one else 
seems interested in the above 
matters either. Whet her it 's 
AS councilpersons complain · 
ing about the poverty they and 
other students are even now 
forced to live in, or the 
Guardiall taking a bold stand 
for tudents rights. there is 
never enough talk about just 
where these rights come from . 

There IS one assumption 
made by the TCSC (and the 
A ,and the Guardiall) that if. 
entirely justified: I think it\ 
safe to say that no student 
wants to pay higher fees. I 
ce rtainly don·t. More

no power. or followers, he 
becomef. an object of derision. 
Such may also be said of 
nations: In the wake of the 
OPEC debacle, wealt hy Saudi 
Arabia has been made to look 
foolish and powerless. 

All signs indicate that the 
Saudis deliberately aborted 
the recent OPEC meeting in 
Geneva. They had nothing to 
gain {'conomlcally from such a 
move; the only reasonable 
explanation is thal they hoped 
to counteract certain political 
losses . This event kshould not 
be taken lightly. Far more than 
a simple f.quabble among oil 
producers, it is a signal of a 
potent ia lIy da ngerous power 
imbalance in the Arab world 
which could bi\dly strain 
relalions v.ith the West.

BULLET TRAIN 

AMTRAK gives ok 
to AHSR project 

WASHINGTON - Amt-
rak's Board of Directors today 
approved an agreement with 
American High Speed Rail 
Corporation, a firm which 
plans to build a 160-miles-per-
hour passenger train system 
between Los Angeles and San 
Diego_ 

The agreement, which 
already ha been ratified by 
the Board of DIrectors of 
American High peed Rail 
Corporation (AHSRC), gIve 
AHSRC license to operate 
passenger train service 
between the two cities. By law 
Amtrak hold" exclu ive rights 
to intercity raIl pas enger 
service in the C mted tates. 
The licensing agreement 
between Amtrak and AH RC 
is limited to the Los Angeles -
San DIego route and provides 
for an annual ba'e licen"ing 
fee to be paid to Amtrak, plus a 
percentage of the amount by 
which AHSRC's gross 
revenues exceed their direct 
cost of operation. 

The base licensing fee WIll 
be calculated to ensure 
Amtrak's projected re\'enue-
to-co"t ratIo for it... o\'erall 
sy"tem will be met de.,plte the 
com peting AHSRC's sen Ice 
between Los Angeles and San 
DIego. The ba<.,c fcc will 
increase each year at the same 
ratt' a<., the Con<.,lJmcr Price 
Index. 

Another stipulation of the 
agreement provides for 
Amtrak to be issued 2,500 
shares of preferred stock in 
AHSRC and for Amtrak to 
appoint no less than one- ixth 
of that company's directors. At 
present, one Amtrak repre-
sentative will fulfill that 
stipulation, since there are 
presently five members on 
High Speed 's Board. 

Amtrak 's Board al 0 agreed 
that Amtrak 's president and 
chairman, E Graham Claytor, 
Jr. , be empowered to appoint 
the Amtrak representative or 
representatives to AH RC 's 
Board. 

Since Amtrak hold s 
exclusive rights to operate 
intercity raIl pa sse nger 
service, it will necessa rily be 
involved 10 any high speed 
intercity rail operation. 
AH RC' projected Los 
Angeles projected Los Angeles 
to San Diego service is the only 
"uch proposal that has 
progressed 10 the point ,vhere 
an Amt rak lice.'n<.,ing agree.'-
ment is needed in order to 
ena ble the project to go 
forward. Such agreement:--
"ill be negotiated with the 

propo~ers of other hIgh speed 
raIl projects, ho\\ ever. 
whenever such projects have 
progressed to the point where 
this is appropriatc.

Interview with Maureen O'Connor 
continued from page J 

I am for aything that would 
get business to relocate in SO 
and I am not prepared to tell 
you anything about tax 
incentives because I have not 
been in city hall for three 
ye~rs, but I know that they are 
facmg a $12 million dollar 
budget deficit, but we must 
give some incentives. 

As far as Otay Mesa goes, 
everyone seems to be hot on 
developing this area, but as in 
North City West, who is going 
to pay for it? There are needs: 

roads and sewers and theot her 
things involved in setting up 

~n ar~a for industry. If the cIty 
IS gomg to pay. where is the 
city going to get the money? 

I am willing to look at 
anything, but my bottom line 
is who is going to pay for it. 
You must remember that we 
are looking at spendi ng 
deficits at all levels of 
government. The reality is we 
don't have much money. Wedo 
have land that is already set 
for industrial development in 
SO in our industrial parks. 
Busine ses are not relocating

A curious component of the

paper, student fees from di -
rectly supporting research and 
teaching. 

If fees are used for these 
activities, accordIng to acra-
mento sources, they would 
have to be termed as "tuitIOn," 
and preventing students from 
bei ng forced to pay tuition has 
become a point or pride with 
Big Valley bean-counters. 

At this point, it is unclear 
how many department · can be 
relabelled as student services 
before somebody calls foul 
and, instead of simply paying 
increased rees , student s will 
be forced to pay tuition. 

The Uni\ersitj is still grap-
phng WIth the effect s of 
DeukmeJIan's emergency two 
percent budget cut imposcd in 
aJanuary:3 E>..ccul1ve Order, a 
cut which actually amountd to 
a four percent shortfall 
because it had to be dealt with 
in onlv the last half of the 
fiscal year. 

A problem has arisen from 
the accounting system that 
the University uses, wherein 
allocations to \'anous depart-
mentsnts arc tagged with a 
flat percentage of "expected 
savmgs" accrued from the

ART II 
Dance troupe will 
grace Mandeville 

By PAUL M. JOI'CS 
There exist various definitions of the 

word "dance," ranging from the overtly 
romantic " poetry in motion " to 
Webster' 'to move quickly up or down 
or about. " While the latter definition 
better describes the manner in which 
most of us dance, the former is certainly 
more appropriate to the dance of the 
American Ballet Theatre II, which will 
peform here at Mandeville Auditorium on 
Saturday February 12, at 8 pm. 

ABT II, the 17-member training troupe 
for its parent company American Ballet 
Theatre (the number two ballet company 
in the US), is directed by Richard 
Englund and Jeremy Blanton. The 
program presents four ballets, three 
created after 1953, and ending with 
selections from Act III of Raymonda 
(1898) by the great classical 
choreographer Marius Petipa, music by 
Alexander Glazounov. 

first on the program is Tribute, 
choreographed by Fredrick Franklin with 
the music of Cesar Franck. Originally 
created as a neo-classical tribute to the 
Ballet Russe, it was first performed in 
1961. 

Diary (1979), created by 
choreographer Lynne Taylor-Corbett and 
composer/vocalist Judith Lander, and 
which also won Silver Medal for 
Choreography at the International 
competition at Jackson, Mississippi. is 
second on the program. 

Next is Pas des Deesses (1954), a 
period piece by Robert Joffrey and set to 
the music of John Field (1782-1837). 
Each variation in this ballet presents 
qualities of the 19th century dancers 
Grahn, Cerrito, TaglionL and St. Leon. 

Ticket prices are UCSD students $8, 
other students $9, and general admission 
$ J O. There are only about 200 main floor 
seats left so you better run, not walk , to 
the box office. For more information call 
the UCSD Box Office at 452-4559.

Who should care what James 
Ralph Papp thin~ about David 
Atherton? (Don't answer now: 
there are another 1400 words to 
go). Conceivably Mr. Atherton 
might care. probably less than 
James himself, but then the 
thousands of you others with 
your eyes glued to the paper are 
unexplained. Whatever 
particular concert or opera I tell 
you about is over. and you won·t 
be able to go to it 

The music world does not 
tremble in fear at my frown. and 
accordingly mend their ways. 
And most of the people who 
attend a concert disagree with 
the reviewer afterwards. 

. whatever position he takes. The 
most I can do here (worth far 
more than the pittance they're 
paying me to do it) is to give a 
feeling of the music in words, to 
encourage you to hear the next 
Atherton concert. or warn you 
not to bother. 

This is the second year 
Atherton has cond ucted the San 
Diego Symphony. The 
improvement to the orchestra 
can only be described by those 
superlatives which we dyspeptic 
critics ar~n 't supposed to use. 
Technically controlled and 
stylistically expressive concerts 
were produced only occasion-
ally two years ago. One couldn't 
be sure of the quality of any 
concert until the last note had 
been crooned or screeched out. 

Thi~ ~a~n , there has not 
been one concert which I have 
not thoroughly enjoyed, The 
.'K'ctions of the orchestra are 
balanced with one another. and 
the individual parts and 
instruments come out clearly. 
Noles are not slurred or played 
out of tune. Of course one 
expects that of a major 
orchestra. because personal 
interpretation is built on a 
technical base. 

Five weeks of unadulterated 
Brahms opened this season. 
Although it is interesting to 
listen to the spectrum of a 
composer's work . I could not 
speculate whether I had the 
willpower to sit that much 
Brahms, just as I wonder 
whether I could sit through a 
dinner of steak and onion pie.

A night at the symphony with 
San Diego's David Atherton 

The Royal Opera House 
celebrated its 275th anniversary 
with a prod uction of The Rake 's 
Progress of Igor Stravinsky and 
W,H. Auden. It was also the 
climax ofthe london Stravinsky 
Festival. of which Atherton was 
artistic director, When it as 
originally produced by the 
Royal Opera. it won the 1979 
awa rd for best opera produced 
that year from SWET. the 
unlovely acronym of the Society 
of West End Theatres. 

make one yearn for variation. 
The series was played so well. 
however. that I did not find 
myself wishing for variation. 

In England. Atherton 's 
reputation is for his 
Interpretations of modern 
music. and I had a difficult time 
convincing, with argument and 
liberal libations of Scotch, a 
critic fr('m Manchester whom I 

met at Covent Garden that to 
hear the movement in 
dynamics. the rise and ebb of 
volume and flow of music like 
melted Callebaut bittersweet 
chocolate over the concert hall 
was the most excit ing Brahms 
watching I had experienced. 

But the Brahms festival is 
over, and it is possible to judge 
the new season in other works. 
Beethoven is pleasantly 
inevitable in any year. and two 
weeks ago, the Seventh 
Symphony materialized on the 
program, Recordings make it

liberally scratched. which is 
something like having the 
Olivier Shakespeare. so it isn ·t 
surprising that I shouldn't like 
Atherton 's Seventh as well. 

Any work of Beethoven is 

complex enough to be open to 
almost unlimited molding by 
the artist. Atherton ' s 
performance was too straight-
forward. The movement from 
del icacy to strength , from 
exquisitely drawn out suspense 
to rough and tumble. was not 
there. The last movement. 
however, was entirely fun, And 
exuberant movement anyway. 
Atherton increased the speed 
from 33 to 45. and the technical 
skill of the musicians to keep so 
many notes so quickly played 
clear and lively is impressive, I 
would say that the t~mpo and

but any army marching at that 
speed would be exhausted 
within three and a half minutes. 
although having travelled 
twelve or thirteen miles. 

The rest of the audience 
disagreed heartily with my 
estimation of the work as a 
whole (though perhaps they 
wouldn·t if they could hear my 

records ), and gave a long 
standing ovation ( whi c h . 
although it was at the end of the 
concert. wa s not wha t 
performers call a standing 
evacuation ). One does not tell 
the audience to be quiet so the 
performers won't gel cocky, 
however. 

David Atherton s reput<ltion 
is built more on modern llIusic 
than on romantic or classical. so 
I shall t<lke the opportunity of a 
new paragraph to backtrack to 
Stravin kyat Covent Garden 
and come back to Bela Bartok at

William Hogarth was painting 
his series of pictures on which 
the name but not the plot. of the 
opera is based at aboutthe time 
of the founding of the Opera 
House. Only twentieth century 
music could communicate the 
atmosphere of the paintmgs, 
and perhaps only Stra vinsky. 
Classical touLhes (harpsichord 
flourishes at the ends of 
phrases) combme with the 
seaminess and raunchiness tha t

accustomed to. 

The libretto. by W.H, Aud en

occasional fits of doggerel but

Twistin' the night away 
with the wild Bangles 

Mikel Toombs recently 
unearthed this ancient Hiatus 
article, originally published in 
the issue of April 1. J 967. He 
believes it·s just as relevant 
today, especially since the 
Bangles will be playing lhis 
Sunday night at the Rodeo. 

Debbi for the most sensational 
harmonies outside of the 
phenomenal vocal group the 
Mamas and the Papas. 

"Vicki's rock hero," Sue 
Bangle explains, "is Susan 
Cowsill. When she saw Susan 
Cowsill hittin' that tambourine 
on The Ed Sullivan Show. she 
said. 'I'm gonna be in a band: " 

Vicki and Debbi are sister., 
who had played in bands around 
lA's South Bay for several years, 
Vicki pluckin ' and twangin ' and 
Debbi hittin' the drums. They 
found guilar-strummer Sue 
through a "musicians wanted" 
ad and the Bangles were born. 
two years ago, in a garage 
(where so many of today's 
happening bands are getting 
their start). They found bass-
beater Annette a while later in 
exactly the same way. 

The Bangle ~isters - are they America's most refreshing new group or just d bunch of party animals? 
" '1 can do that!' .. Vicki 

Bangle remember exclaiming. 
'She's no older than I am: .. 
"That's what The Partridge 

family was based on, for sure." 
Sue says. " 'I'm gonna pick up a 
tambourine and learn to play. ' .. 

At first, the girls called 
themselves the Colors. and then 
the Bangs. That boss name 
lasted through one neat single 
("Getting Out of Hand"). until 
they discovered an all-boy (and 
very unchivalrous. we 'd say!) 
group from New Jersey had a 
prior claim to the title. So. the 
Bangs became the Bangles, as 
sort of the next best thing. (One 
of the suggested new monickers 
was the Shebangs, but the girls 
wouldn't go along with that 
one.) 

Herlin gets mileage out of HSex" 

But. Vicki adds Quickly, " I 
said, 'To hell with that. I'm 
gonna pick up a guitarand learn 
to play: " 

The Bangles, America's most 
refreshing new group, have 
already upstaged Misses Cowsill 
and Partridge with their just-
released record , the groovy 
Bangles. A five-song disk, it's on 
the Fau Ity label. but it's 
anything but faulty. 

The Bangles are Sue 
(Susan na). Vicki. Debbi, and 
Annette, and the newest Bangle. 
They're all girls. as you may 
have noticed, and their ages 
range from 20 to 25. What you 
may not have known is that they 
play all their own instruments, 
and we 'd say they play them 
very well. Sue and Vicki write 
most of the hot Bangle 
originals, and teem up with 

The Bangles ' biggest 
influence is, of course. the 
BeatJes. (You can hear some of 
"Help" in "The Real World " and 
a lot of "Taxman" in "I'm in 
Une"). The girls listen to radio 
station KRlA where, Sue relates, 
she heard dJ. Johnny Hayes say 
the Lemon Pipers ' "Green 
Tambourine" had been ghost-
written by Paul Beatie. "And ," 
she says. "I trustJohnny Hayes: '

Berlin has gone from being an

lAo Berlin in more recent times 
has gained popularity with the 
hit single . Sex" from theIr 
album Pleasure Victim. 

Berlin began five years ago in 
Los Angeles. Up to no\\' there 
have been four incarnations of 
Berlin each a different step in 
the evolution of the band. The 
present incarnation of Berlin 
consists of vocalist Terri Nunn. 
bassit/synthesist John 
Crawford, synthesist Dave 
Diamond and Daniel Van Patton 
on drums. 

John Crawford. the major 
contributor of Berlin 's material 
has been with the band from the

Crawford the band had a very

Terri Nunn has been with this

She did hO\~e\er leave form 
1980 until 1982. Shortly after 
her return Berlin was signed to

Vinyl in the absence of Nunn

album, record executives were 
confident about signing Berlin. 
As Crawford comments, " the 
industry is having a very 
difficult time. They really aren t 
willing to take a risk with a new

now is looking at how groups 
are doing on the independent

Shaggs' Own Thing 
The Sbaggs 
Rounder/Red Rooster Over the past tew weeks the 

news of 9IX's format change has 
blazed back and forth across the 
pages of Hiatus. 8y now it is no 
longer new news of any type but 
the effects of this move are 
going to be felt from now on. 
Now you may be saying to 
yourself. " What does this 
mean?" What it means is that 
local promoters now have a 
market for the music that was 
up to a few weeks ago not 
profitable. for too long bands 
that enjoyed immense 
popularity in Los Angeles would 
spur only a very sparse response 
from San Diego. Other bands 
would just not play San Diego 
because they thought it was a 
DMZ (Dead Music Zone). 

X released two albums on 
Slash records. an offshoot of 
Slash magazine. both of which 
did incredibly well, The success 
of these two albums prompted 
Elecktra to take another look at 
X and sign them to publish their 
recent release Under the Big 
Black Sun. Instrumental in the 
success of X is their 
producer / manager Ray 
Manzanera, Manzanera. who has 
the notriety of once playing 
organ for the Doors. saw the 
quality present in X before any 
of the major companies. His 
faith in X has helped them 
become a successful band with 
musical integrity, X will play 
this Sunday at the Backdoor.

shouting into a metal garbage 
can, and it perches on the wall 
out of the direct line of the 
singers' voices. 

Atherton gave a greater 
peformance, in fact simply a 
great peformance, with pianist 
Michael Ponti in San Diego. They 
played Bela Bartok's Piano 
Concerto Number Two. I have 

never liked Bartok's music 
much: because it is not very 
tuneful. I usually get bored with 
it. But here the driving rhythm 
with the agonized emotion 
emerging from it. the 
counterpoint of section with 
section of the orchestra, the 
force and directed style of the 
horns and other brasses, and the 
deep bass of the piece were

Yard bird s, early Stones, Joan And what are the Bangles' 
Baez, Joni Mitchell. Creedence plans for the future? 
and early Rod Stewart 
(Annette's best bets), Byrds and 
"all the electric folk stuff. " A 
recent date at a Sunset Strip 
club, heavily attended by the 
local heavy media, saw them 
playing the Seeds' "Pushin ' Too 
Hard," Simon and Garfunkel's 
"A Hazy Shade of Winter," and 
the fast-rising new single by 
Love, "7 and 7 Is." In the 
audience that night were a 
couple Cowsills, as well as 

"We're gonna, like, try to 
really work on new material." 
Sue says. "And, like, come into 
our own as a band, and maybe 
record a record, an album:' 

So, the Bangles are ott to a 
fast and fun start, and we 're sure 
you'lI be hearing a lot more 
from them. And we wouldn't be 
surprised if you 'lI still be

brought out so well by all the 
performers that I would not 
have been bored to listen to the 
concerto over again, 

One of the most innuential 
artists, and for that fortunately 
one of the best, to have come to 
San Diego, is David Atherton. 
His peformances have brought 
the Symphony, which costs 
hardly more than it ever did to 
be heard, to be something far 
more worth listening to. If this 
article has been successful. it 
has given you a feeling of the 
Quality of peformance he gives,

travel out of town to hear.

which spotlights Dot Wiggin's 
intuitive lead guitar, 

Also of interest is "Gimme 
Oat Ding," recorded live (and

the incredibly square vocal 
version of "Shaggs' Own Thing," 
featuring the " singing of

destructive after a while, 
Playing in clubs ends up costing 
the band money and then 
people begin to say, 'Well let's 
not go see Berlin tonight 
because we can go see them 
tomorrow night." 

Musically, Berlin is a polished 
popular band. As Crawford says, 
"I like to write pop songs. I like 
to write melodically. Everything 
should fit in with the format of 
the song including the lyrics. 
"While Crawford did contribute 
most of the content to Pleasure 
Victim, Nunn is also a composer 
and was the creative force 
behind the lyrical content of 
"Sex. " " We were in the studio 
one day playing and I began to 
do these gutteral moans then we 
hit the idea of having the 
different facets of a woman's 
personality." 

" In my experience:' Nunn 
continues, "I've found that the 
lyrics of 'Sex' are completely 
true. I've been every woman that 
is mentioned in the song but 
men usually end up being just 
men. ' 

As sta ted before Crawford is 
the major contributor of 
material to Berlin. However, he 
is not the sole composer of the 
band, " Everyone in the band 
writes. We are all pretty diverse 
in our interests and our styles," 
says Crawford, " Right now we 'd 
like to take Berlin as far as it can 
go. Then we'll start considering 
solo projects. Who knows? This 
might go on for another ten 
years. We'll just have to wait and 
see," 

Nunn sees her role in the 
band 's material expanding with 
their future endevours, "John's 
material is more commercial 
than mine, The things that I 
write are a lot more 
experimental. I hate to say 
commercial. but record 
companies want hits. Their main 
objective is to make money. It's 
just that John 's songs are much 
more pop-oriented than my 
own. He's a very meoldic writer 
and I'm more off-the-wa ll." 

Berlin will play this evening 
with Green on Red at the Rodeo 
in La Jolla.

ReVIew keeps road loss streak going 
College basketball has seen 

only four modern dynasties -
by modern I mean in the last 25 
years - and they would be 
UCLA, Kentucky, Indiana and 
North Carolina. 

The dynasty is the school 
that does not recruit. but 
selects. When they ell the Blue 
Chip High School Athlete, the 
phone is always answered.

They are usually TH £ school 
in the state as far as tradition 
and prestige. the chool t hat is 
habitually on national 
televIsion. 

Most obviou~, of course, is 
the world created bv John 
Wooden. The Wizzilrd of 
Westwood. at UCLA. Nobody 
won more than John Wooden. 

tarting in 1964. he won 10 
NCAA title in 12 years. a 
record that will never be 
matched. which makes him 
the Caesar of College 
Basketball, and his disciple, 
Larry Farmer, his Marc 

Anthony, is carrying him 
today. 

The Bruins normally go 
nine deep with every kid being 
an all·stater and potential 
first·round draft choice. They 
normally win more than half 
their games during warmups, 
and their cheerleader are 
better known than the 
winning teams of some major 
conferences. 

Second is the Univer ity of

LOS ANGELES - With 
3:20 left in regulation and the 
Tritons trailing 58·51 Tuesday 
night, Azusa Pacific's Terry 
Turrentine was dribbling 
upcourt against heated 
pressure from UCSD point 
guard Bob Goodman. As 
Turrentine approached 
midcourt, the Courgar band 
started to play the theme from 
the "Lone Ranger." Just as the 
famed masked man and his 
Indian sidekick were picking 
up peed, Turentine found his 
teammate Kendall Berkley all 
alone in the left corner. 
Berkley promptly launched a 
20·foot rainbow that found 
not hing but net, turning out 

UCSD's light and diminshing 
all relative comeback hopes. 
Another road loss in league 
play for the men (their fourth 
without a win), this time by a 
score of 7]·59. 

Ironically, it was Azusa who 
had to make a remarkable 
comeback in order to avoid a 
blowout on its home floor . 
Playing their best ball since 
the Loyola Maramount victory 
one month ago, the Tritons 
built up a 17·4 advantage in 
the first seven minutes of play. 
They were able to accomplish 
this with crisp passes around 
the perimeter that always 
seemed to find the open man. 
Ray Banales was the main 
beneficiary, pumping in 10 
points during the stretch, all 

A CUI Tournatnenf 
Following a series of 

rigorous competitions which 
included contests in bowling. 
billtards. backgammon, chess, 
darts, and table tennis, the 
UCSD campus champions in 
the ACUI tournaments 
(Associat ion of College Unions 
International) will move on to 
Cal State Fullerton on Feb. 18· 
20 to compete in the AC111 
Regionals. 

Respresenting UCSD in 
bowling are Brian McKinley 
andJerry Dclaco, Brian Carter 
in billiards. MIke Weber and 
Jim Lakdawala in back· 
gammon, Leo Stefurak in 
chess, Kevin Lea in darts, 
Vijay Rao and Tien Nguyen for 

men's table tenni . and 
Isabell e irolle and Kris 
Trattner for women's table 
tennis. 

All of these students will 
represent UCSD as they 
compete in t heir sport against 
students from other colleges 
and universities in California. 
The winners of the regional 
com pet ition then go to the all 
expense paid national 
competition~. The ACUI 
competitions are held 
annually at coIreges and 
universities throughout the 
nation and are an opportunit y 
for students who excel in 
student union·type games to 
compete at their highest level. 

from long distance. But Azusa 
scratched and clawed their 
way back to within two at 
halftime, largely because the 
Tritons committed five of 
their seven first·half 
turnovers in the last five 
minutes while the Cougars 
were precise on 65 percent of 
their field goal attempts. 

With Head Coach John Block 
taking care of business 
matters in Scottsdale, 
Arizona, Assistant Tom 
Marshall made his debut as a 
collegiate head coach. 
Marshall didn't deviate from 
the UCSD game plan that is 
employed by Block, but he did 
alter the sub titution pattern. 
Mike Maross. who Block said 
would g t his first start of the 
sea 'on against Azusa, did 
start, and played well. The 
man he replaced, Mark 
Barrecca. barely saw action, 
and Steve Flint, who had been 
playing better of late, never 
took off his warmups. 
Brandon Nixon saw limited 
duty, and Mike Dabasinskas 
played all of three minutes 
even though center Dave 
McGuire was not that 
effective. But one could not 
fault Mar~ha)) for his game 
strategies, especially since the 
players he used produced. 
Well, at least in spurts they 
did .

Running Thoughts 
By MIKE GREENBERG and JEFF SAVAGE 

Staff Writers 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE DEPT. Defeat is certainly 
deceiving. At first glance, most onlookers who viewed the UCSD 
men's volleyball team in action last week against Pepperdine and 
UCLA would come away with the impression that the Triton 
are a decent but not exceptional team. True, UCSD dropped both 
matches in three games, but the scores were very impressive 
considering the foes they were up against. Losing by a total of 
nine points in a three game defeat to the nation's fourth ranked 
team, Pepperdine, is a feat in itself. Then having to play on a few 
hours rest (Peppedine match was Friday night and UCLA was 
Saturday afternoon), UCSD held their own against the number 
one ranked Bruins, losing 5·15, H·15, 14·16. The fact that the 
Tritons can't even offer scholarships while these powerhouses 
get the cream of the crop says a whole lot for Doug Dannevik's 
club. Besides producing a national champion in women's v·baIl, 
Dannevik has worked marvels in producing a viable contender in 
the men's game. Hopefully , Dannevik will not be forced to leave 
due to an unsatisfactory salary. 
NOT TO BE BELIEVED DEPT. We thought we had seen it 
all with the incredible multi ·million dollar deals being afforded 
baseball players in the last few years, but the deal with At lama 
Braves slugger Bob Horner takes the cake. The Braves have 
added a $400,000 weight clause to the Atlanta th ird baseman's 
new four·year $5.5 million cont ract. The a&reement req uires the 
s lugger to weigh in at all of the Braves Friday night home 
games. Each time he tips the scale at 215 pounds or less, he 
earns nearly $7,700. The deal may take the cake, but let's hope 
Homer doesn't eat it. 
THEY ASKED FOR IT DEPT. By stealing Dick Williams 
from the Montreal Expos before la st season and staying with 
him long enough (a full two years is a long time for the Padres 
organization) to ee steady improvement; by hanging on to Tim 
Lollar, Terry Kenned y, and RuppertJones; by being patient with 
the farm system long enough to now be able to draw upon 
exceptional young athletes. thereby affording a superb bullpen 
a nd fresh centerfielder; and finally by pushing for the 
acquis ition of Steve Garvey, the San Diego Padres have asked for 
a pennant. It looks as though they're going to have to suffer 
through their best season ever in ] 983. 
COULD IT BE DEPT. With the United States FOOl bal ' 
League season opener almost upon us (March 6), we decidr'd to 
fi nd out why San Diego is not among the 12 entrants. Bill 
Daniels, a multi·millionaire businessman, actua lly had a team in 
San Diego but moved it to Arizona a few months ago. According 
to Ted Koppe)), who also doubles as a RUllning Thoughts 
correspondent. Daniels recei ved a call from Chargers owner 
Gene Klein, who offered him $500,000 a year for life if he would 
keep the team out of San Diego. Apparently, Klein and the 
Chargers organization have had trouble selling their team to the 
San Diego community. and are fearful of the competition from 
thp..USFL franchise.

Men's AA promises to be a real shoot-out 
in the last few weeks of the regular season as 
a host of teams in six different leagues start 
scrambling for play-off berths. The reat power 
seems to be localized in three of those 
leagues (Brown, lewis, and Goorjian 
leagues) as no less than 18 teams have 
legitimate shots at play-off spots. Brian 
Lariviere's Raposa Inn quintet has held onto 
the Number One spot all season despite a 
couple of shaky performances a couple of 
weeks back. Doug Lisle, Tim Bolden and the 
rest of their Just Plain Great gang seem to 
have the numbers to blow teams away in the 
play-offs, but so far their schedule has been 
suspect. Last year's "A" finalistTKE has moved

_4 WSDO comes next week 'Women come back from two week 
layoff with seven game streak By MIKE AHN 

"Moon Riverrr ... Widerrr 
than a miiiile ... " 

Starling February 16, being 
near any river is a two·stroke 
penalt y. Yes, it 's time for the 
Andy Williams San Diego 
Open at Torrey Pines Golf 
Course. Actually, this year it 's 
called t he l suzu-A WSDO, due 
to an exchange of sponsor-
ships since last year. But 
never mind . The greats w ill be 
out there, going for the green, 
laying up short , pulling out , 
a nd doin g a ny other 
nationally-known golf cliche 
Ihat we hacker~ know and love 
so \'ery much. 

The $:300,000 Open will 
feature the be~t and the 
brighte~t of the PGA Tour. 
Last year the tournament 
ent ry list ca rried t he most 
famous name s in golf, 
including Tom Wat so n , 
"M ister Consistency" Tom 
Kite, Jack "The Golden Bear" 

ICklau~, and Craig " The 
Walrus" Stad l er. Johnn y 
Miller took dov,:n last year 's 
tourney WIth a down-to·the· 
wire \;ictorv that left Miller 
wit h the imze money and 
Nicklaus wi t h his dust. 

The rain wi ll playa decisive 
factor in this year ' s 
competition, as it did at the 
Bmg Crosby Pn}-Am at Pebble 
Beach . The wet turf wi ll allow 
the players to take drops and 
establish better lines, thus 
allo\\ ing lower and perhaps 
record -breaking scores. 

The contest w ill begin on 
Feb. 16 with a celebrit y Pro-
Am, featuring such famous 
duffers as lI al l.inden, Claude 

Akins, Efrem Zimbalist and of 
cour. c Andy Williams himself. 
For those who wish to prove 
themselves under fire, former 
President Jerry Ford will be 
out pelting the gallery wil h his 
lethal s lice. The tournament 
will al so be highlighted by a 
golfers' wives' luncheon on 
Tuesday. Don't miss any of it!

through the sound barrier 
under Dean Smith, who made 
it to the Final Four six times 
and finally grabbed the 'braf-i~

Now just what makes a 
dynasty? As I said, that school 
has to be THE school in Ihe 
state; it has to govern it s 
conference, and it's alwavs the 
team the ot her se\ en or' eight 
chools votc against. It has to 

come from a basketball state, 
which all these four do, and it 
has to be THE sport in the 
school. It also has to gel 
network exposu re. 

The coach of a dynast\' IS a

Nothing Else Feels Like Navy Flying. 

The thunderous roar 
of jet engines rolls 
across the carrier 's 
flight deck. 

Throt tles are at 
full power, and you 're 
waiting for the signal 
to launch . 

Now. The catapult fires. G forces 
press you back into your seat. Suddenly, 
you're flying low and fast over the open 
sea. Zero to 150 in 2.5 seconds. 

Nothing else feels like Navy flying . 
Nothing. And when you become a pilot or 
flight officer you're at the very heart of it. 

Once you 've earned your wings, 
the Navy puts you in full control of a multi-
million-dollar supersophisticated 
combination of jet aircraft and electronic 
wizardry. 

And Navy training makes sure 
you're up to the challenge. Rigorous flight 
t raining gives you the 
navigation, aerodynam· 
ics and other techni-
cal know-how you need. 

Leadership and 
professional schooling 
prepare you for the 
immediate decision· 

making authority and 
management respon· 
sibility you have as an 
officer in the Navy. 

On the ground, as 
a Navy officer, you 
work with and supervise 
today's most highly 

skilled aviation professionals. In the air, 
as part of the naval aviation team, you 
have about the most exciting job anyone 
can have. 

I t 's a uniquely rewarding job with 
pay to match. You start at $18,300 a year 
- more than the average corporation 
pays you just out of college. After four 
years, with regular Navy promotions 
and pay increases, your annual salary 
climbs to $31,100. That's over and above 
a full package of benefits and privileges. 

Find out how much more a job in 
naval aviation has to offer. Fill in the 

coupon. No other job 
gives you the kind of 
leadership experience 
or fast responsibility 
you get as part of the 
naval aviation team.
