Thousands of admitted students and their families visited UCSD as part of the second annual 
Triton Day, Saturday, April 6. 

The daylong event featured a series 
of activities that lasted throughout the 
day, including academic sessions, col-
lege tours, performances, open houses, 
and a student organization fair.

The day began with a 20-minute 

welcome session at Price Center, which 
introduced the admitted students 
and families to campus and provided 
them with information about the day’s 
events. 

After the welcome session, col-
lege ambassadors led students to their 
respective undergraduate colleges, 
where they spent the morning learning 
about different student and academic

Following four years of service 
as the Revelle College Provost, Don 
Wayne Ph.D. announced that he 
would be stepping down from his 
position, as well as from his fac-
ulty position as a professor in the 
department of literature, effective 
June 14, 2013.

Associate Professor Emeritus of 
Political Science Ann Craig will be 
acting as interim provost beginning 
July 1, 2013, until Wayne’s successor 
is chosen next school year.

A Guggenheim fellowship recip-
ient, Wayne received his Ph.D. in lit-
erature at UCSD in 1975, coming to 
the university as a faculty member 
within the department of literature 
in 1975.

Since then, Wayne has served 
as chair of the department of lit-
erature, as well as chairs of vari-
ous campus and UC system-wide 
committees including . As Provost, 
Wayne developed a series of study 
abroad scholarships for Revelle 
students and began a tradition of 
inviting distinguished alumni to 
deliver keynote addresses during 
commencement.

Wayme was co-chair of the 

Advisory committee involved with 
proposing a diversity, equity and 
inclusion graduation requirement 
and three-term, ex-officio Academic 
Senate Committee representative 
for the Council of Provosts. In his 
positions, he was instrumental in 
creating strategies to increase the 
number of incoming students from 
underrepresented communities. He 
also began a series of environmen-
tal sustainability programs dedi-
cated to the namesake of Revelle 
College’s apartment complex, theo-
rist Charles David Keeling.

“Provost Wayne has had a pro-
found impact on Revelle College and 
the UC San Diego campus,” Executive 
Vice Chancellor Suresh Subramani 
said in a campus-wide statement. 
“Working closely with college staff, 
he improved the working dynamics 
across units to foster cooperation and 
collaboration in providing essential 
services to students.”

Beginning September 2013, a 
committee will begin the campus-
wide search for Wayne’s successor.  

Students will vote on University 
Centers’ referendum to increase stu-
dent fees by $11 per quarter. Voting 
will take place this week alongside 
elections for A.S. Council and college 
council positions.

If passed, the resolution will dedi-
cate money to reopening the Crafts 
Center as well as the general main-
tenance of Price Center and Student 
Center. 

The referendum was first intro-
duced Fall Quarter 2012 as part of 
UCEN’s initiative to reduce its deficit. 
UCEN conducted a survey to deter-
mine the amount in fee increases that 
would be most palatable to students, 
with both graduate and undergradu-
ate students prefer a $13 fee increase.

A series of back-and-forth revi-
sions between A.S. Council and the 
Graduate Student Association ini-

tially suggested that the referendum 
would not make it to the spring bal-
lot. However, both student organiza-
tions managed to send the measure to 
the University of California Office of 
the President for approval.

The total fee increase is $11 with a 
yearly CPI adjustment of up to 3 per-
cent, bringing student fees to $87.50 
per quarter. Currently, each student 
pays $76.50.

Students will also vote for A.S. 
Council and college council candi-
dates from five slates: One Voice, 
United, Flow With The Feng, Triton’s 
Choice, and Keep it Real. Open A.S. 
Council positions include president, 
three vice presidential spots, as well 
as a variety of senatorial positions.

NEW ENDOWED CHAIRS ▶ After 
over $8.5 million in donations, 
UCSD has established five new 
endowed faculty chairs to help 
recruit and retain top faculty mem-
bers. Four chairs will go to the 
School of Medicine, and one will go 
to the Jacobs School of Engineering. 
Endowed chairs offer supplemental 
funding for teaching, research, and 
service to the chair holder. UCSD 
has 164 endowed faculty chairs, 
including the five new ones.

“In only five decades, UC San 
Diego has risen in stature to become 
one of the top-ranked universities 
in the nation, and that is directly 
related to the quality of our fac-
ulty,” Chancellor Pradeep K. Khosla 
said. “We are deeply grateful to our 
donors who help us to attract and 
retain phenomenal scholars through 
endowed chairs. Their visionary 
support is critical to advancing UC 
San Diego’s overall academic excel-
lence.”

FIREWALKING ▶ Several people 

were transported to a hospital fol-
lowing burns to their feet during a 
firewalking activity at an Adconion 
Media Group bonding event. 
Hundreds of employees participated 
in the firewalking activity around 
8:30 p.m. on April 3 at Paradise 
Point Resort & Spa in Mission Bay.

San Diego firefighters and para-
medics responded to the 911 call at 
9:45 p.m., and the victims were sent 
to UCSD Medical Center, accord-
ing to San Diego Fire Department 
spokesperson Maurice Luque.  
“It’s a subjective judgment that 
somebody has to make for them-
selves,” Luque told NBC San Diego. 
“Common sense had to prevail.”

LEGOLAND HOTEL ▶ Legoland 
in Carlsbad officially opened its 
Legoland California Hotel on April 
5. The three-story hotel has 250 
rooms and is targeted towards kids 
twelve and under.

The hotel has a total of 3,422 
Lego models, including a 400,000 
brick animated dragon at the 

entrance, as well as rooms featur-
ing pirate, adventure and kingdom 
themes. Each room, reached via a 
“disco elevator,” also includes kid-
friendly sections with bunk beds 
and Lego treasure chests. Hotel rates 
begin at $149, with extra costs for 
premium rooms; guests are allowed 
early access to the Legoland Park 
and the opportunity to dine with 
costumed Lego characters.

MAPPING THE MIND ▶ President 
Barack Obama announced the 
Brain Research through Advancing 
Innovative Neurotechnologies, or 
“BRAIN” Initiative on April 2. The 
initiative, designed to understand 
the brain better through advances 
in science and technology related 
to deciphering brain activity, will 
receive roughly $100 million in 
funding in the 2014 fiscal year bud-
get. UCSD Chancellor Pradeep K. 
Khosla and several UCSD direc-
tors and professors were present at 
Obama’s announcement.

“We anticipate our scientists will 

continue to play key roles in this 
great endeavor,” Khosla told UCSD 
News Center. “Researchers from UC 
San Diego — in collaboration with 
colleagues at Salk and others on 
the Torrey Pines Mesa — will be 
involved in almost all areas of the 
BRAIN initiative, from those in the 
sciences and engineering, who will 
help to draw the brain-activity map, 
to those in social sciences who will 
help to read the map, figuring out 
how brain activity translates into 
cognition.”

SDSC ▶ UCSD’s supercomputer, 
Gordon, started last year by the San 
Diego Supercomputer Center, com-
pleted processing data from nearly 
one billion particle collisions, its 
largest task to date. The data process 
is part of a project for the Large 
Hadron Collider.

Gordon is partnered with the 
Open Science Grid, a research 
partnership funded by the U.S. 
Department of Energy and the 
National Science Foundation.

Le expressed her enthusiasm for the 
spring elections. 

“Personally, the position I’m 
invested in most is the A.S. President 
position, because I’ll be transition-
ing that person for the next year,” 
she said. “There are definitely some 
quality candidates, and I’m excited 
to see how this year’s elections will 
turn out.”

The candidates for president 
include Meena Kaushik of United, 
Courtney Hill of Triton’s Choice, 
Sammy Chang of One Voice, Andy 

Buselt of Keep it Real, and Caeser 
Feng of FLOW with the FENG.

Kaushik expressed her slate’s 
interest in increasing student ser-
vices, including extending A.S. Safe 
Rides to Week 10 and finals week for 
students who stay late on campus.

Hill’s Triton’s Choice advocates 
a practical approach to improving 
student life, such as exploring a vari-
ety of transportation options before 
coming to a decision.

Buselt plans to address the trans-
portation issue in part by implement-
ing bike paths around campus as 
part of a platform that emphasizes 

sustainability.
The candidates on Chang’s One 

Voice slate rejected their stipends in 
favor of putting the funds back into 
the A.S. Council budget. 

Feng’s FLOW with the FENG slate 
drew on diversity by pulling students 
in leadership positions from around 
campus to run for A.S. Council posi-
tions. 

The elections will take place April 
8 to April 12 on TritonLink, with a 
result announced on Friday, April 12.

service opportunities. Activities 
included residential life tours and 
an information session about col-
lege events. Afterward, students had 
the option to attend a variety of ses-
sions and activities offered through-
out the day. 

Academic sessions allowed stu-
dents the opportunity to meet fac-
ulty and staff from a variety of 
UCSD’s academic departments and 
learn about their chosen majors and 
minors.

In addition to campus sessions, 
a variety of open houses, includ-
ing Geisel Library, RIMAC Arena, 
the LGBT Resource Center and 

the Jacobs School of Engineering 
allowed students and families to 
independently tour UCSD’s on-
campus facilities.

A student organization fair 
took place on Library Walk from 
9:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and featured 
numerous on-campus student orga-
nizations. 

 Changes from last year’s Triton 
Day included the relocation of 
Charting the Course, a college plan-
ning and information session, from 
the Faculty Club to the Conrad 
Prebys Concert Hall to accommo-
date a larger audience. 

“This year, Triton Day featured 
a few new events, including the 
Student Life BBQ, an end of the day 

event to connect admitted students 
with current students in a relaxed 
and social atmosphere,” Assistant 
Manager of Marketing and Media 
Relations Christine Clark said. 

More food vendors participated 
in Triton Day this year, including 
Housing, Dining, and Hospitality 
dining halls Pines, Cafe Ventanas, 
Canyon Vista, and Foodworx, which 
were opened from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. 
Thurgood Marshall College offered 
a variety of food vendors for its 
Cultural Celebration, serving dishes 
of delis, tacos, gyros and lemongrass 
barbecued chicken.

Gordon processes data generated 
by the Compact Muon Solenoid

“Access to Gordon and its excel-

president

sammy   Chang    one   VoiCe
at a pivotal moment for our university, Sammy Chang knows what challenges lie ahead for this campus, and he knows how to fix them.

It would probably be easier to name all the positions that 
Chang has not held during his illustrious student government 
career at UCSD. From his freshman year 
on Warren College Student Council’s 
Judicial Board and Finance Committee, 
to his most recent tenure as associate 
vice president of academic affairs, Chang 
has shown a repeated investment in 
going above and beyond the call of duty 
to ensure the best college experience for 
his peers.

 Valuable experience as chair of the 
Sports Facilities Advisory Board and 
vice chair of the Student Fee Advisory 
Committee gives Chang the unique 
resume of having worked under all three 
vice presidential departments. Chang 
has held over 10 positions in Earl Warren College, WCSC and 
countless other executive and advisory boards around campus.

Chang has also involved himself in WCSC-specific and 
campuswide issues throughout his entire college career. He 
presented nine times in front of A.S. Council on behalf of a 
variety of campuswide and UC systemwide issues.

Chang has noticed serious monetary and procedural 
issues with council this year. Chang fought hard to keep A.S. 
Council’s undergraduate research grants well-funded despite 
plans by other councilmembers to cut those budgets. Chang 
laments this year’s cuts to student organization’s operation 
funds (which cut the baseline amount of money A.S. Council 
gives to student organizations by 80 percent) and will work to 
restore this funding.

Perhaps Chang’s most notable gesture was declining a 
stipend for his position as the associated vice president of 
academic affairs — which he did in order to fund his entire 
staff. Chang, as has the rest of his slate, pledged to do the 
same with his stipend next year.

One Voice’s plans to enact legislation 
against all A.S. councilmembers receiving 
stipends have come under fire in recent weeks, 
with critics calling the slate “elitist” or a slate 
for “rich kids.” Chang himself is partially 
funded by the Blue and Gold Opportunity 
Plan, and before qualifying for the program, 
he had to work to pay his way through school 
in his junior year. A commuter from Carmel 
Valley, Chang says that the idea that his slate 
is in any way “elitist” is a complete myth, 
explaining that most of his slate is on financial 
aid and that of the $100,000 that Council 
would save on stipends, $15,000 would be set 
aside and pooled and allotted to low-income 

individuals who want to become a part of A.S. Council.
Chang and his slate One Voice are pledging to tackle A.S. 

Council’s internal budget problems within their first five 
weeks in office. The slate’s 35-day plan includes provisions to 
reject their council stipends, pump up funding for research 
grants, hold at least one outreach and community event 
per week and create four new undersecretary positions, as 
well as work to allot 60 percent of available A.S. funding to 
student organizations.

Chang’s vast experience and demonstrated commitment to 
enhancing student life makes him a strong candidate and leader 
for this campus. We wholeheartedly supports Sammy Chang, an 
expert on campus life and its history and a veteran leader who 
knows the ins and outs on A.S. Council, for A.S. President.

W hen Leonard Bobbitt arrived for his interview, he was literally bobbing up and down with ideas. He could graduate after this year, but is staying for a fifth year 
due in part to his desire to make changes on campus before he 
leaves. We have no doubt that he is the right person to elevate 
student life to the next level.

From serving three years as the associated vice president of 
college affairs and restructuring First Year Council, to fighting 

for the student voice on UCAB and programming events for 
Earl Warren College, Bobbitt has experience flying out of his 
ears. He wants to get rid of the supposed winter quarter lull 
by spearheading the creation of a winter festival, which will 
be great for students who impatiently wait all year round for 
Sun God. Bobbitt also hopes to reform Founders’ Day into an 
all-day community event reminiscent of UC Davis’ Picnic Day. 
He is a champion of event sustainability and will push for bio-
fueled, zero-emission festivals.

Bobbitt is especially big on connecting communities across 
campus. He seeks to foster a more LGBT-friendly environment 
by making it easier for students to obtain coed housing and 
instituting more gender-neutral bathrooms across campus. He 
also wants to make it easier for students to learn about hard-to-
find events across campus by creating a searchable all-campus 
events calendar. Among many other ideas to unify our campus, 
he seeks to bridge the gap between A.S. Council and students 
through tabling every week, podcasting meetings and allowing 
students to submit legislation to committees.

Bobbitt’s goals are grounded in tangible plans, and we are 
confident that he is by far the strongest candidate for this position.

Price Center, Student Center and the Che 
Cafe are deteriorating: The paint is chipping, the 
balconies are creaking and the insulation is leaky. 
And for the first time since it opened 40 years ago, 
the Crafts Center was closed for the 2012–2013 
academic year. Many A.S. councilmembers want 
to raise student fees by $33 per year — that’s about 
a dollar per student every week — to keep four of 
UCSD’s best-known activity centers from falling 
through the cracks.

The measure would increase students’ 
mandatory University Centers fee from about $230 

to $260 per year. Vendors and A.S. representatives 
report they aren’t sure how renovations will be 
financed if the UCEN referendum doesn’t pass, but 
they do agree that the renovations in question are 
necessary. This means that if the UCEN referendum 
does not pass, rent — and, therefore, prices — will 
increase at student center shops and restaurants.

One way or another, students, who are the 
University Centers’ primary users, will have to pay 
for the renovations that will be made in coming 
years. We think a simple fee increase up front is 
better than dozens of small markups in prices.

uCen   referendum: yes

i n case you haven’t noticed the posters, the flyers, the banners and the rave cards that have been popping up everywhere around campus over the last month, Associated Students and college council elections are this week — April 8 to April 12. By signing on to TritonLink, 
you can vote for next year’s class of student leaders, who are promising to do everything from 
lowering tuition to making UCSD less socially dead. If you know nothing about the candidates 
running or are not election-saavy in general, we advise you to follow our guide when voting 

this week. Over the course of five days (and twice as many cans of Red Bull), we grilled all 
five presidential candidates, all 12 vice-presidential candidates and 25 of the 27 campuswide 
senatorial candidates running this year. Two senatorial candidates were unable to meet with 
us due to time conflicts. We based our endorsements on the following criteria: thorough 
knowledge of the subject matter relevant to their job, relevant experience in or out of A.S. 
Council and — most importantly — concrete and workable ideas for improving student life.

A self-described idealist and inquisitor, 
One Voice candidate Dan Ovadia hopes 
to lead a grassroots spirit campaign and 
revamp A.S. from the bottom up, with 
intentions to increase student creativity 
and establish a student think tank. He 
has set himself apart with his goal to 
put Housing, Dining, and Hospitality 
Services under the microscope, promising 
to reform the system and expose HDH 
cooking practices and pricing to all 
students. Ovadia plans to support and 
increase the readership of UCSD media outlets through a more 
integrated phone application. An Eagle Scout with experience in 
tutoring and campaign volunteering, Ovadia has potential to be an 
effective leader as a campuswide senator.

ask Vanessa Garcia a single question, and she’ll give you the answers to five more. She knows the ins and outs of the major 
campus issues and sees how they’re all related. 
It’s clear to her what affects students day to day 
and how to fix the administrative mess.

Garcia is as capable and as qualified for the 
position of vice president of external affairs 
as she is knowledgeable. Experience on the 
Student Sustainability Collective as well as 
social justice education efforts through the 
Women’s Center helped the Triton’s Choice 
candidate develop the new associated vice 

president position. Her work as a delegate 
on the UC Student Association gives her an 
edge in her hopes of using the vice president 
of external affairs position to advocate for 
students on a statewide and national level.

Garcia has already demonstrated a 
history of holding UCSD administrators 
accountable for sticking to promises — she 
successfully pushed the university to host a 
sustainability town hall in May. Opposed to 
most fee increases, Garcia supports the UCEN 
referendum for its role in maintaining student 
activities and reopening the Crafts Center. 
Garcia says she’ll work with administrators and 
alumni to find other ways to fund Division I — 
including a plan to increase Cal Grants to help 
fund student athletes.

Garcia also shows proficiency in her ability 
to reach out to diverse communities as a 
Revelle College resident advisor, philanthropy 
chair of UCSD’s Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority 
and a member of the La Jolla Community 
Planning Association. Her existing connections 
with members of the Graduate Student 
Association will help ease communication and 
collaboration between the two bodies.

Lauding SOVAC voter registration efforts 
leading up to the November 2012 election, 
Garcia called Proposition 30 a “temporary 

fix to a permanent problem. She will work 
to engage potential voters even in a non-
election year.

Garcia has the experience and the drive 
to be a successful motivator and leader for 
our campus.

K eep it Real candidate Sean O’Neal is just that: real. The clear frontrunner for the position of vice president of finance is a 
junior biophysics and economics double major 
and is fluent in the language of finance. He 
is rightfully next in line for the position after 
serving as the chief of staff of the A.S. Finance 
Office under current VPF Bryan Cassella. He 
already has a thorough understanding of the 
A.S. budget, but his institutional knowledge 
of the subject hasn’t blindsided him. He is 
extremely critical of the current financial state 
and sees room for significant change and 
innovation. His perception of the budget is 
realistic, but it’s his concrete list of new goals that 
garnered our attention.

O’Neal’s goals are many. Some are lofty and 
longterm, such as laying down the groundwork 
for A.S. Council to become a non-profit 
organization within the next 15 years. O’Neal 
wants council to become completely sustainable 
from student fees by seeking alternative sources 
of revenue, such as Triton Outfitters, which is 
a part of A.S. Enterprises. He wants to create 
a smartphone/web app that accessibly lists all 
UCSD events and meetings to increase student 
involvement. But it’s his goal to effectively 
add more student representation to fee-based 
committees that really got our attention. 

O’Neal has no interest at throwing money 
at problems. He wants to make an internal 
change within the A.S. budget in order to receive 
concrete external results that students can see. 
Additionally, O’Neal wants to have monthly 
meetings with all of the treasurers or financial 
heads of all student organizations to keep orgs 
in the know throughout the year to increase 
financial transparency. His experience and 
ideas make it clear that he’s the guy to trust with 
the less than stellar budget that A.S. Council is 
working with now. After working in the A.S. 
Office of Finance and the Muir College Council 
for two years, the only logical next step for the 
talented and logical O’Neal is sitting on A.S. 
Council as a voting member.

Campuswide   senators

W ith eight spaces open every year, the campuswide senator position is a major route for newer leaders to get 
into A.S. Council. This year’s competition was 
challenging, with 27 candidates running for the 
job. Campuswide senators ran on five slates: One 
Voice, Triton’s Choice, UNITED, Keep it REAL and 

FLOW with the FENG. We didn’t pick candidates 
based on their slate platforms — rather, we picked 
the individuals we thought best reflected student 
values and progress for our university. Due to 
scheduling conflicts, Lewis Simon (One Voice) and 
Jacob Thater (FLOW with the FENG) respectfully 
declined to be interviewed.

Dan   oVaDia

As a junior hoping to 
bring efficient leadership 

and new blood to council, United slate 
member Avanthi Hulugalle has a new 
perspective to bring to the table with 
projects including redesigning the A.S. 
website and bettering the relationship 
between A.S. Council and student 
organizations. Hulugalle is a force to be 
reckoned with, having outside leadership 
experience as president of Chi Omega 
and chairperson of the Health and 
Medical Professions Preparation Program. She will bring innovative 
solutions by focusing on student participation and compromise.

Jordan Coburn of Keep It REAL 
has an activist spirit with ideas to 
further involve students and student 
groups. Coburn is also a fan of using 
SOVAC’s OVAL to gauge student 
input on council issues. If elected, 
she will emphasize education and 
transparency with more town hall 
meetings and student loan debt 
workshops to educate students on their 
options. Currently chief of staff for the 
A.S. Office of External Affairs and a 

former UCSD delegate to the United States Student Association 
Congress, Coburn will channel her considerable leadership 
experience into a new role if elected campuswide senator.

Brianna Nelson of Triton’s Choice 
began her stint in student government 
as part of the Thurgood Marshall 
college council. She is currently serving 
as its director of administration, as 
well as the policy director for the 
A.S. Office of the President. With 
her insight into A.S. Council, Nelson 
has already had experience with 
hot-button issues like divestment 
and transportation. As a member of 
SOVAC, she has a keen interest in 

increasing the exposure of A.S. Council and campus resources to 
all students. Nelson hopes to develop an open source textbook 
program to help students with rising textbook costs, and wants to 
design a streamlined website to increase campus communication

One Voice’s Vincent Honrubia is a 
strong advocate for the diverse groups 
on campus. He wants A.S. Council to 
focus on issues that are important to 
the student experience, such as funding 
for student organizations. He believes 
in his slate’s platform that up to 60 
percent of A.S. Council’s budget should 
be spent on students who are involved 
with campus organizations, and like the 
other members of his slate, he will not 
take a stipend for himself. Expressing 

strong support for the Greek, military and athletic communities, 
Honrubia can go far with his platform of transparency and unity.

Allyson Osorio is a clear choice for 
campuswide senator from the Triton’s 
Choice slate. While she has never served 
on council before, she has worked in 
the A.S. Office of the President and 
the Office of Diversity Affairs, giving 
her an inside perspective on council. 
She understands the importance of our 
campus climate and has worked with Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Penny Rue’s 
diversity committee to create solutions 
for students’ campus issues. Osorio 
also wants to create a space for students to voice their opinions 
about A.S. Council, particularly through office hours and other 
interpersonal means.

Fifi Akel of the Keep it REAL slate holds the 
concerns of commuters at the forefront, 
and hopes to foster integration and 
communication on campus. Akel is a 
very well-spoken and practical candidate 
with concrete knowledge on various 
important issues including divestment, 
UCEN referenda and transportation. 
As a commuter and a candidate outside 
of the A.S. bubble, Akel seems to most 
accurately represent the true needs of 
students. She hopes to make strides in 
transparency by increasing the number of town hall meetings, and 
possesses clear goals to build bridges and connect communities.

Guy Elezra of the United 
slate has quite a bit of 
leadership experience in both student 
government and the Greek community. 
Elezra is currently both A.S. Council’s 
Revelle College senator, and the 
president of Alpha Epsilon Pi. He has 
innovative ideas to increase cooperation 
between A.S. Council and Greek 
organizations, such as giving chapters 
the ability to order letters directly from 
Triton Outfitters. Elezra sees the A.S. 

bubble as a serious problem preventing effective government, 
and he wants to encourage student involvement through 
SOVAC’s OVAL and by regularly reaching out to college councils.

the  Many  Faces of  eating  Disorders
A look at the harmful eating habits of college students

at a time when over 35 percent of American adults are considered over-weight — according to a statistic from the Center for Disease Control — and obesity has been implicated in heart disease, stroke and certain cancers, 
the current trend in American public health has been to promote weight loss.

It's this inclination that UCSD professor and clinical therapist Danielle Beck-
Ellsworth, who teaches a class on the psychology of eating disorders, says that 
diseases at the other end of the spectrum — anorexia nervosa, bulimia and binge 
eating — have escaped the limelight. 

Collectively, however, these diseases have the highest mortality rates out of 
any mental illness, according to statistics released by the national eating disor-
ders association.

“It’s something that hasn’t really been on the radar,” Beck-Ellsworth said. “On 
a social level, we’re not really obsessed about eating disorders the way we are 
about obesity. But ironically, the more we stress weight loss, the more we may be 
encouraging unhealthy eating habits. Instead of focusing on weight, we need to 
be promoting a healthy lifestyle.”

Beck-Ellsworth warns individuals about drawing conclusions from eat-
ing disorder statistics, sufferers tend to share a number of personality traits. 
Individuals struggling with an eating disorder is often very rigid and motivated 
and have a very reward-dependent mindset. 

Studies have also shown that eating disorders can be triggered by traumatic 
events. But likely the most talked about cause of eating disorders as of late is the 
cultural pressure created by the concept of equating skinny with pretty.

Co-founder of the Summit Eating Disorders and Outreach Program in 
Sacramento Jennifer Lombardi, a survivor of anorexia nervosa, said that more 
research on the subject has revealed a number of trends emerging amongst 
college-aged sufferers of eating disorders. Lombardi said that college students 
may be put at particular risk because of the stress of a new environment and the 
cultural expectations associated with coming to college.

"Going to college is a very exciting time,” Lombardi said. “There's a lot of

Over spring break, the now-iconic symbol of the pink equal sign set against a red 
background was uploaded and shared 
as a mark of solidarity with the LGBT 
community during the Supreme 
Court hearings in Washington D.C. 
The Supreme Court began their hear-
ing on the constitutionality of bans 
against same-sex marriage — specifi-
cally the Defense of Marriage Act and 
California’s Proposition 8 — on Tues., 
Mar. 26.

The day before, the Human Rights 
Campaign (HRC) — one of America’s 
largest LGBT rights organizations — 
uploaded the pink and red version 
of their logo. They requested their 
Facebook followers to “make their pro-
files red” in order to raise awareness of 
the ongoing Supreme Court hearings 

and to show support for the LGBT 
community. Within 24 hours, the pic-
ture went viral. Facebook data ana-
lysts published on their Facebook Data 
Science page the following Friday that 
roughly 2.7 million more people than 
usual changed their profile picture 
in the wake of the HRC’s Facebook 
update.

Kevin Chu, an intern at UCSD’s 
LGBT Resource Center, noticed that 
a handful of his friends were changing 
their profile pictures and sharing links 
about the Supreme Court hearings on 
Facebook.

“As the day went along, more and 
more people changed their profile pic-
tures,” Chu said. “It’s really powerful to 
see people throwing in their support.”

Over the following week, the 
Facebook trend was adopted by celeb-
rities and ordinary people alike, some 
being creative with their logos by 
adding in bacon strips or puppies. 

Variations representing an opposition 
to same-sex marriages cropped up as 
well — a pink +, X, or =/= on red 
accompanied with biblical quotes were 
passed around by supporters of tradi-
tional marriage.

But many used the term “slacktiv-
ism” — a combination of the words 
“slacker” and “activism” —  to crit-
icize the equality sign trend. Blogs 
on the Huffington Post, International 
Business Times and  PC Magazine 
weighed in on the value of a profile 
picture. Many of them noted that the 
red profile pictures had no effect on 
the eventual outcome of the Supreme 
Court trials. However, they also noted 
that the trend demonstrated the wide-
spread support of same-sex marriage.

“This whole concept of judging 
someone because they’re not ‘being 
enough of an activist’ is completely 
faulty,” Chu said. He jokingly referred 
to himself as a slacktivist since his 

preferred method of sharing his point 
of view is sharing links on Facebook.

UCSD graduate Adam Powers, 
who doesn’t consider himself an 
activist, said that he changed his 
profile picture to show that he stood 
in favor of the marriage equality 
movement and is willing to defend 
that viewpoint against others who 
wish to challenge it.

Powers sees the simplicity of the 
meme as an asset. 

“People need symbols to rally 
around,” Powers said. “[The equality 
sign] appears convenient, familiar 
and effective.”

Chu, who didn’t change his pro-
file picture despite the fact that he 
works at the LGBTRC, said he feels 
unnerved by the symbol.

“[The equality sign] puts the 
HRC as the face and voice of the 
movement,” Chu said. “Considering 
some of the things it’s done in the 

past, [such as silencing transgender 
and undocumented people], that’s 
not too exciting.” 

Traffic to the HRC website 
increased by 600% in the 24 hours 
following their initial post, accord-
ing to a March 26 press release by 
the HRC. During the protests out-
side the Supreme Court, the HRC 
requested a speaker to remove refer-
ences to being undocumented and 
had transgender flags taken down. 
The HRC later apologized for both 
actions in a blog post.

Despite his reservations, Chu 
appreciated the support.

“If I was still a teenager in the 
closet and all my friends were 
changing their profile pictures, I’d 
feel affirmed in my identity a little 
bit more,” Chu said.

Human Rights Campaign’s Equality Sign Sets Fire to Social Media

F e a t U R e s  T h e  U C S D  G U A R D I A N  |  M O N D AY,  A P R I L  8 ,  2 0 1 3  |  w w w. U C S D G U A R D I A N . O R G  5

A Facebook profile riddled with photo-
graphs of your latest drunken adventures 
never makes a good impression on a potential 
employer who lays eyes on your public page. 
UCSD alumnus Adam Markowitz, however, 
believes that he has found a way to merge the 
social network with the professional world. 
Markowitz is the founder and CEO of the-
Portfolium, a website that serves as an online 
portfolio for students to visually display their 
resumes of academic achievements and work 
experience. The website was launched in late 
2012.

The idea for the website came to Markowitz 
in 2008. He found it incongruous that while 
there was a permanent record of his social 
experiences online, none existed for his aca-
demic records.

“There wasn’t an online profile that I was 
proud to show an employer, my family or my 
parents,” Markowitz said. “All my cousins are 
the same age as me, so they were in college at 
the time. It was a little sad that I couldn’t tell 
you what some of them were majoring in, but I 
could tell you about every party they ever went 
to, because that was what I saw online.”

ThePortfolium incorporates the basic func-
tions of common social networking sites — 
messaging, commenting and “liking.” Users 
can choose to view the portfolios created by 
others and bookmark pages that they find 
interesting or impressive. Furthermore, users 
can contact other users, giving them the 
opportunity to engage in professional net-
working.

All users have complete control over their 
privacy settings, along with all the content 
that is uploaded to their page, or portfolio — 
be it photos, videos or written entries about 
a particular experience. Students can utilize 
the description box offered with each entry 
they upload to elaborate on any additional or 

relevant information.
The list feature gives the portfolio an orga-

nized feel. Students can use the list functions 
to group their portfolio entries into different 
categories. Once the portfolio has been filled 
and polished, a custom URL linking to the 
online page containing the portfolio can be 
created. With this, students can easily access a 
readily presentable copy of their portfolio on 
an iPad or smartphone anywhere they go. This 
way, a portfolio can easily be showcased in dif-
ferent settings — at career fairs or interviews. 
In the near future, Markowitz promises a PDF 
function to allow users without a portable 
Internet access point to print out formatted 
versions of their portfolios.

Markowitz said the site has received posi-
tive feedback from both students and employ-
ers.

A student using thePortfolium once decid-
ed to bring an iPad to a career fair to show 
employers his online portfolio. When the 
employer saw his accomplishments, his eyes 
lit up.

“Why did you give me your resume?” the 
employer asked. “You should have started with 
this. This is exciting. I can see what you’re 
working on — see how much you’re involved.”

Of course, Markowitz explained that they 
aren’t trying to replace LinkedIn and other 
such websites that allows for users to create 
resumes and professional online profiles. He 
views thePortfolium as a way to supplement 
students’ resumes and distinguish themselves 
among their peers.

“It’s the 21st century, and we’re still using a 
paper resume,” Markowitz said. “You can’t get 
a sense of someone’s passion or experience just 
from a piece of paper.”

Experts Suggest That Raising Awareness of  Eating 
Disorders May Help Promote Healthier Lifestyles 

emphasis put on having a wonderful time and 
becoming more independent, but rarely do we 
talk about how stressful that change may be. 
For someone with the acknowledged personality 
traits associated with eating disorders — the anxi-
ety, in part caused by the myth of the Freshman 
15 … may be enough to cause individuals to turn 
to that kind of behavior." 

Characteristic of a number of psychological 
diseases, eating disorders are difficult to both 
diagnose and treat, because they’re caused by an 
array of issues — biological, social and cultural. 

From an anatomical standpoint, the excess or 
lack of specific chemical messengers, known as 
neurotransmitters, in the brain have been impli-
cated. For this reason, individuals diagnosed with 
an eating disorder often also suffer from either 
obsessive-compulsive disorder or depression. A 
treatment option may include the prescription of 
antidepressants.

“There are a lot of contributing factors in the 
development of an eating disorder,” Lombardi 
said. “Biological risk factors, psychological predis-
position, a family history of anxiety or obsessive-
compulsive traits and temperament all sort of 
co-mingle.”

Lombardi regularly deals with sufferers of the 
disorder at her treatment center. She corroborated 
a study on “drunkorexia” published in 2011 by 
the University of Missouri. The authors of the 
study coined the term "drunkorexia" to describe 
individuals who forgo food in order to consume 
calories in the form of alcohol. According to the 
online questionnaire that they used to survey 
undergraduates at the University of Missouri, 
approximately 30 percent of female students 
reported restricting calories to “save them” for 
alcohol consumption. 

Though the conclusions from the original 
study did not consider the psychological effects 
of the “Freshman 15,” Lombardi said that the 
phenomenon may be a backlash to the public-
ity of Freshman 15, which gained traction up to 
a decade ago in the popular media. However, 
a 2011 paper published by researchers at Ohio 
State University found that college freshman only 
gain an average of 2.4 pounds for women and 3.4 

pounds for men. 
Both Lombardi and Beck-Ellsworth agree that 

the profile for individuals with eating disorders is 
not nearly as narrow as formerly believed.

 “It’s not just young, Caucasian girls that are 
affected by eating disorders,” Beck-Ellsworth said. 
“It can affect anyone.”

Surprisingly, studies have shown one demo-
graphic of college-aged individuals in particu-
lar to be heavily impacted by eating disorders. 
In 1999, a study published in the International 
Journal of Eating Disorders found that in a 
pool of 1,445 student athletes, 9.2 percent 
of women were diagnosed with bulimia and 
10.85 percent were seen to engage in binge 
eating on a weekly basis. Although there is no 
hard and fast rule requiring it, the weight of 
female athletes are not listed on any NCAA 
roster across any sport. 

Recently, eating disorders have received 
more attention from the medical and academ-
ic communities. But both Beck-Ellsworth and 
Lombardi agree that more needs to be done. 
Beck-Ellsworth noted that in spite of a 10 
percent mortality rate amongst the diagnosed, 
medical professionals still don’t have formal 
training in handling eating disorders. 

“I think the biggest thing that needs to 
change is an increase in awareness,” Beck-
Ellsworth said. “People need to be aware that 
this is something that can affect everybody. It’s 
important not to just immediately rule some-
one out because of their appearance.”

UCSD Crew Competes at Annual Crew Classic
 cRew

The UCSD crew teams competed 
in the 40th Annual San Diego Crew 
Classic last weekend, April 6 to April 
7 in Mission Bay.

The UCSD women came away 
with mixed results heading into 
the Western Intercollegiate Rowing 
Association conference champion-
ships April 27 to April 28. The UCSD 
Varsity 4+ boat, competing in the 
Division-II and Division-III brack-
ets, crossed the finish line with a 
time of 7:58.30 to take first in the 
grand final. Team members included 
junior coxswain Catherine Sheffler, 

sophomore Mary Elizabeth Bilder, 
freshman Shruti Kamath, junior 
Olivia Knizek and sophomore Rachel 
Schneiderman.

UCSD also placed first in the col-
legiate Division II and Division III 
Varsity 8 petite final, with the JV boat 
coming out in front with a time of 
7:25.12.

In the San Diego Zoo and Safari 
Park Cup grand final, UCSD’s A 
Boat finished in fourth (7:16.25). 
University of Central Oklahoma took 
first in front of UC Santa Barbara, 
Humboldt State and Orange Coast 
College. 

“For the [Varsity 8], we have a 

lot of work we need to do before the 
conference championships,” senior 
Ashley Travaglione said. “It could 
have been a better race, technically, 
for us, but it wasn’t a bad result. The 
[Varsity 4], though, just had a great 
race. Looking forward, though, it’s 
just going to be a lot of work before 
going to nationals.”

The UCSD women are currently 
ranked third in the regional stand-
ings behind first-ranked Western 
Washington University and second-
ranked Humboldt State. The top two 
teams will advance to the national 
tournament. The UCSD women’s 
crew team did not qualify for the 

national tournament last season 
under former UCSD head coach 
Pattie Pinkerton. But this season, 
Travaglione says UCSD may have a 
better chance under new head coach 
Colin Truex.

“We’re definitely better this sea-
son,” Travaglione said. “The coaching 
change has been really positive. We 
just need to be sure that we don’t get 
complacent in the next few weeks. If 
we do that and put the work in, then 
I think we definitely have a good shot 
at qualifying this season.”

Columnist 
Would Love 
a Walk-on 
Spot, Please
back to Triton Ballpark, RIMAC 
Arena or Canyonview Pool. Maybe 
there could even be a publicity stunt 
where the basketball team offers 
a walk-on spot to an untalented, 
uncoordinated, 6-foot-4 Guardian 
columnist to boost interest in both 
the paper and the athletic depart-
ment. (The ball is in your court, 
Coach Carlson.)

Whatever the case, attendance at 
matches and meets will stay steady 
without a jumpstart in school spirit, 
just as my elusive second growth 
spurt and poor ball-handling will 
continue to keep me from playing 
basketball competitively.

Many of this year’s A.S. Council 
candidates said they believe that a 
lack of school spirit is one of the 
biggest issues facing campus this 
year. At least three others said that 
they felt that Triton Athletic Council 
president and women’s basketball 
co-captain Erin Grady was the best 
example of student leadership at 
UCSD. Athletes and athletics are 
inspirational on and off the field.

Take pride in your athletes, 
UCSD. Your student ID card is not 
just an overpriced bus pass (with an 
expiration date). It’s a ticket to the 
Triton show. And it’s only getting 
better.

Greatness is around you. That 
girl wearing the gold-on-navy jacket 
in front of you in lecture — she’s a 
hardworking and dedicated Triton 
athlete. She’ll be at the game. Will 
you?

As the postseason approaches, Triton Track and Field shows strong at 
the Sun Angel Classic and the Mangrum Invitational.

BY RAcHeL UDA  SPORTS EDITOR

Put Me in, 
Coach; 
I Play 
“Left Out”

The UCSD Track and Field team split its ranks last weekend, April 5 to April 6, with half the squad at the 
Mangrum Invitational hosted by Cal State 
San Marcos and the other half competing at 
the 34th Sun Angel Classic at Arizona State.

UCSD’s top-tier athletes traveled to 
Tempe, Ariz. in order to both showcase 
their talent among the nation’s best col-
legiate athletes and also push for national 
championship qualifying times. Over the 
two-day meet, the Tritons came away with 
some good results.

“The athletes we took to Arizona this 
weekend all have an NCAA national cham-
pionship mark,” UCSD assistant coach Nick 
Howe said in a phone interview. “We do this 
meet every year to prep our top athletes for 
NCAAs. While the competition is generally 
high-caliber, it’s really just on par with our 
normal season meets, including the Triton 
Invite, Cal-Nevada and San Diego State 
Invite.”

Freshman long-jumper Kristin Sato 
placed third in her event with a mark of 
17’6.75”, UCSD’s highest finish at the Sun 
Angel Classic. Sato — sixth on UCSD’s all-
time list for the triple jump — also placed 
sixth with a jump of 39’3” in the event.

On the track, sophomore Sabrina 
Pimentel continues to impress. Last sea-
son, Pimentel placed ninth with a time of 
2:15.25 and this season, the 2012 All-CCAA 
Freshman of the Year set her personal best 
in the women’s 800-meter race, clocking in 
at 2:11.71. Junior Lauren Irish also slated a 
strong performance, finishing tenth overall 
at 1:02.88 in the 400-meter hurdles.

“Sabrina Pimentel’s race was great. She 
had to fight through two girls that didn’t 
want to let her get past,” Howe said. “She 
had to fight through 600 meters to get the 
lead and then put a sizeable ten-meter gap 
between herself and her competitors in the 
last 200 meters for a new [personal record].”

In the throws, component seniors Ryan 
Eckert, Zach Nagengast and A.B. Shaheen 
all fared favorably. Eckert took sixth in 
the shot put for a mark of 50’8”. Shaheen 
and Nagengast placed seventh and eighth 
respectively in the hammer throw.

Assistant coach Nick Howe — former 
UCSD two-time All-American — said his 
younger brother Nash Howe threw well 
under expectation. Although Nash Howe 
— just a sophomore — threw the spear 
198’8” for a fourth-place finish, the mark 
was far below his season high of 212’4”, set 
at the San Diego Collegiate Challenge back 
in March.

In contrast, competing in San Marcos, 
freshman Haley Libuit — younger sister 
to two former UCSD javelin throwers — 
placed second at the meet, throwing 127’9”.

UCSD is now over halfway through their 
season, with many Tritons already qualify-
ing with provisional NCAA championship 
marks, the remainder of the schedule will 
likely prove an effort to sharpen up before 
the CCAA championships. Last season, the 
Tritons placed second in the women’s divi-
sion to Chico State, while the men placed 
third. 

The Tritons’ next event will be this 
Saturday, April 13 at the Pomona-Pitzer 
Invitational in Claremont, Calif.

My dad always told me that he hoped I could one day cross what he called “the 
Jack Haley line” — Haley being a 
1980s and ’90s NBA forward-center 
for the Bulls, Lakers, Nets and Spurs 
and the “line” being 6 feet, 10 inches 
tall. Using Haley as a reference, 
6-foot-10 is apparently the mini-
mum height for a highly untalented 
player to get an opportunity to play 
ball at a higher level.

Unfortunately, I tapped out at 6 
feet, 4 inches (with shoes) and now 
have as good of a chance at making 
the Triton starting five as I do of 
becoming the next pope (which my 
being Jewish suggests might not be 
likely). But now, I have a new role 
covering Triton sports, and I think 
I’m going to like this gig.

Like Newton’s first law of motion, 
intercollegiate athletic programs 
tend to perform consistently year-
to-year until a major change — such 
as sacking a coach or investing new 
money into a program — comes 
along and creates a paradigm shift. 

Our athletes are some of the 
most dedicated individuals on cam-
pus, and their contribution to our 
campus is unmatched by most other 
co-curriculars. Same goes for atten-
dance at these games. The number 
of fans who show up to Triton sport-
ing events is consistently low — and 
that’s a darned shame.

In a more established column, 
this is probably the part when I 
would include some figure about the 
average attendance is at this year’s 
UCSD basketball games. I don’t 
need to.  I’ve seen it. It’s pathetic. 

The same is true for our other 
sports. It’s appalling that I can go to 
a game at which the student fan sec-
tion is literally the student (singular) 
fan section. That is unacceptable 
for an athletics program at a major 
university.

Some will say that it’s because 
we’re in Division II—thinking 
that if we competed against bigger 
schools, it would be more exciting to 
watch. For some sports, that’s true, 
but UCSD, unbeknownst to most, 
already has successful programs 
competing at the Division-I level. 

You know your friends at USC? 
Yeah, ask them which San Diego-
area school’s volleyball program 
swept them this year. And what 
about the 24 athletes in men’s epee 
at nationals this year? Mm-hmm. 
Two of them were from right here 
on campus.

But UCSD athletics are nota-
ble even in sports not competing 
against big-name schools. For the 
second year in a row, Triton swim-
mers have brought home gold med-
als at the national championships, 
and the softball team has a chance at 
making the final game for the third 
straight season.

What can be done to get more 
folks in the stands? 

Giveaways are always nice. Spirit 
Night is only once per year. Division 
I is a not-too-far-away solution, but 
even D-I’s prestige can’t fill seats by 
itself. 

What we need is a renaissance in 
school spirit. Whether that comes in 
the form of A.S. Council initiatives 
or a jump to the next level, some 
change is needed to bring the spirit
