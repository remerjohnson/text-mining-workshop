Letter to the Editor 
Initiatives Will Take from Students 
Unless Bloc Turns Out to Stop It 
Editor: 

Anyone with an eye on 
the news media has heard 
of Proposition 9, (Jarvis II) 
which will be on the June 3 
ballot. One would be hard-
~essed to find a ballot 
laue that hits closer to 
home than this one. It 11n't 
hard to find information and 
opinion on Proposition 9, 
but there i8 more to the 
June ballot that this 
question. 

For those of us who are 
off-campua rnidents. we 
have Proposition 10. In 

addit on to exorbitant 
tuition, our rent may be 
going up in cadence with 
the Consumer Price Index. 

Both Propositions 9 and 
10 are on the ballot 
because of citizen 
inniatlves. This current fad 
of clmcumventlng the 
legislative process through 
initiative seems to bring 
proposals that benefit a 
monied class. Students are 
not largety included in this 
category. 

In San Diego County 
there are approaching 

1 00,000 students that ale 
eligible to vote. With even a 
semblence of unified 
voting, this is enough to 
swing the vote on a ballot 
question. 

The deadline to register 
is May 3. voter registration 
cards are available through 
EDNA. ASUCSD. and the 
College Deans' Offices. I 
hope we realize in time that 
the questions to be decided 
on June 3 are going to 
affect us. Our vote can be 
our say.

Editor: 

Without the pursuit of 
Uterature, 

On Tuesday, March 18 
during the 11 :00 pm 
showing of the Second 
Annual New York Erotic 
Film Festival. a beer bottle 
was thrown through the 
screen in USB 2722. 
necessitating the replace-
ment of the ei~t hundred 
dollar screen. the movie 
was being sponsored by the 
UCSD RacquetbaU Club 
and the profits were to be 
used to sublldlze club 
night. 

How can any science 
hope to endure, 
Its reduction to simple 
technology, 
Through absence of 
man from their oIogy? 

Without the man of the

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) 
Clark Kerr, who Io.t hia job 

in 1967 as UC preaidenlwhen 
he oppo..d efforts to impoee 
tuition, now .. YI he favon 
tuition. 

Kerr, speaking at the 60th 
annual convention of the 
American Alloc:iation of 
Community and Junior 
CoIIetea, said he changed hi. 
mind after taking hi. current 
job with the Camqie Council 
on Policy Studies in Higher 
Education at Berkeley. 

He said he found that low-
income familiel lublidize 
college for high.income 
studentl because fewer low. 
income Itudentl attend 
college, even though their 
parenti pay taxes to support 
the in.tibJtion •. 

.. A lot of studentl who go to 
public inltitutionl do come 
from familie. who could afford 
to pay tuition," he said. "It'. 
more socialJy ju ... " 

Kerr .aid college ltudentl 
should pay about one·third the 
COlt of their education, which 
now averages about $3,000 
per Itudent, but only if 

lChoIarahipa are availab&e for 
Iow·income .tudentl. 

UC ltucientl now pay about 
$750 a year in varioul fees. 

Kerr said he does not favor
