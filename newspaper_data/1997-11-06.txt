University students celebrat-

ry over the University of 
Texas by capturing a goal-
posts from the football field. 
Members of the football team 
took the goalpost and carried 
it to the university student 
center before leaving it at the 
house of university President 
Robert B. Sloan . Campus 
security initially placed the 
goalpost into storage, but 
moved it to the student center 
after many student requests. 
Sloan said that he has not 
seen any condemnation of the 
act and is proud that students 
support the team. According 
to Baylor Police Chief Jim 
Doak, the police were more 
concerned about the safety of 
the UT coach than the goal-
post and had no intention of 
putting a damper on the fans' 
emotions.

Court Upholds 209 
LAW: Proposition will now 
remain part of California's 
Constitutional Bylaws 
By Leena Shankar 
Associate News Editor 

Proposition 209 cleared its final hurdle to 
implementation Monday morning when the 
U.S. Supreme Court refused to review its con-
titutionality. 

Californians passed Proposition 209 by a 54 
to 46 percent vote in November 1996, and the 
American Civil Liberti es Union (ACLU) 
immediately challenged it in federal court . U.S. 
Distri ct Court Judge Thelton Henderson 
deemed Propo ition 209 potentially unconstitu -
tional and blocked its implementation, but a 
three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of 
Appeals reversed Henderson 's ruling in April. 

According to Proposi ti on 209, "the state 
shall not discriminate against, or grant prefer-

ential treatment to, any indi vidual or group on 
the basis of race, sex , color. ethnicit y or nallon-
al origin in the operation of public employ-
ment , public education or public cont racting." 

The case will now return to the U.S. District 
Coun III San Francisco. 

UC Regent Ward Connerly, a husinessman 
of panial African and Nati ve Ameri can descent , 
chaired the campaign for Proposition 209 and 
said he was pleased with the Supreme Court 's 
decision. 

"I think the words of the proposition are the 
best way to say why I'm in favor of it," 
Connerly said. 'The only permanent so lution i~ 
to know that the government is not going to 
trea t u ~ differently ha~ed on where we are born . 
what race we are, or our religion or skin color." 

The ACLU. which opposed the proposition, 
requested that it be reV iewed by the Supreme 
Coun.

Discusses 
Outreach 
TALK: Speakers propose 
possible ways to increase

Committee member Paul a Doss, Marshall 
serllor Ingrid Benedict and Vi ce PreSident of 
Operations for the Parent Institute for Quality 
Educati on David Valladolid mel Tuesday at the 
Cross Cultural Center 10 discllss Ihe universi -
ty's role in Ihe community. 

The panel members questioned whether 
UCSD's focus on research prevents the campus 
from becoming more involved in community 
outreach. 

Doss said she hopes to find a balance 
between UCSD's emphasis on research and the 
university 's obligation to serve San Diego. 

"The university can be research oriented, 
but it can also be community oriented," she 
said. 

Mehan told the audience that he believes 
UCSD has a responsibility to serve the San 
Diego community. 

"We are a public university, paid for by tax-
payers dollars - we can 't forget that':' Mehan 
said. "We have an obligation to serve the pub-
lic and to educate the public." 

Mehan said that he was very disappointed 
when the faculty voted against creating the pro-
posed UCSD Charter High School last June. He 
added that having a high school for under-
achieving, high-potential students from under-
represented San Diego communities would 
have been an ideal form of outreach for UCSD. 

All of the panel members offered ideas on 
how to increase racial diversity at UCSD. 

Valladolid said he thinks universities should 
educate parents on what they need to do to 
make sure their children can one day attend col-
lege. 

"Every child must have a chance to attend a 
university like UCSD," Valladolid said.

CIA Recruiter Finds Disruptive 
Audience at UCSD Presentation 
FORUM: Participant 
throws bones at 
representati ve 
By Quyen Tu 
Scaff Writer 

What was Intended to he an 
information session on Ihe Central 
Intelligence Agency (C IA) and its 
future ended up as a forum for 
members or the UCSD community 
to voice theIr disapproval with the 
organization. 

Soulhern California CIA 
recruiter Michael Mau gave a lee-
ture entitled " 50 Years of CIA" to 
an audience of approximately 70 
people Monday night :It the Pepper 
Canyon Lodge. The event was 
sponsored by the International 
Affairs Group. 

'The primary job of the CIA is to 
collect information on the world for 
the president and lawmakers." Mau 
said. "When we have visiting world 
leaders, policy makers want to 
know the political and economic sit-
uations of that country so they can 
focus their talk on those issues." 

Mau told the crowd that most 
of the public's knowledge of the 
CIA is based on action movies 
such as "Patriot Games." 

"About the only thing that' s 
true in Patriot Game is the scene 
with the CIA emblem on the 
floor," Mau said .

UC Berkeley Professor 
Discusses Max Weber 
RELIGION: Bellah 
addressed ethics of 
world-denying love 
By MIke Myers 
Guardian Reporter 

Sociologist Roherl Bell;ah , a 
professor emeri tu, at UC 
Bl! rkeley. spoke at UCS D on Oct. 
23 about the issuc of "world-deny-
ing love" in thc suciulogica l writ -
ings of Max Wehcr. 

Bellah has ~tudi ed thl: evolu-
tion of rcligion in Asia and the 
United States. He is the author of 
severa l books, including Beyol1d 
Belief, 77,e Brokel1 CrJ\'f! /wl1l and 
Hahits of the Heart. 

Bellah 's lecture was presented 
jointly by the UCSD Center for the 
Humanities and the Burke 
Lectureship on Religion and 
Society. 

Bellah 's comments addressed 
Weber's views regarding salvation 
religi ons' ethics of neighborly 
love. 

According to Weber. religious 
notions of brotherly love requiring 
followers of the faith to love 
everyone are capable of redefinmg 
traditional socia l spheres, while 
simultaneously becoming a threat 
to these ~pheres. 

"It Ireligion] has thi ~ capacity 
to create leverage on the world," 
Bellah sa id, " hecause it has this 
tension with the world." 

Bellah sa id that those who 
accept the notion of uni versa l love 

generall y also accepl Ihe 
inevi lable conflici bel ween 1Ill1vcr-
~al love and soc iewl ~Ianda rds . 
Bellah added that those who 
:Iccept the idea of universal love 
cvelllually renounce Ihe ~(lCietal 
const ructs Ihat ()ppose Ihl ~ luve. 

Bellah ci ted Jesus, Buddha and 
St. Francis of Assisi as cxal1lple~ 
or those who have renounced 
worldly ideals such as wea lth and 
family in exchange for brotherly 
love. 

" It is hard to sec how any 
be liever in world-denymg love caf\ 
be anything hut a renouncer, " 
Bellah said. 

Bellah noted that the tension 
bet wecn leachings of brotherly love 
in salvation religions and the prac-
tical requiremenls of society have 
been addressed by most faith s 
through compromise. The teaching 
of universal love and self-sacrifice 
is acknowledged, hut unly a select 
few arc held 10 it , usually in Ihe 
form of monastic life. 

Bellah said Weber rejected the 
notion of compromise, ultimately 
concluding thaI world-denying 
love had no place in the modern 
age. 

Bellah concluded his lecture by 
4uestioning Weber's conclusion, 
noting that such fi gures as 
Mahatma Ghandi and Marlin 
Luther King, Jr .. have used hrolh-
erly love 10 make notahle a,hieve-
ments in politics - a sphere 
Weber saw as impossihly incom-
patible with brotherly love.

SENIORITIS HITS AGAIN 
By Jonah Freedman 
Senior Staff Wriler 

Midlerms arc over. Week five is 
now in Ihe books. and, wi th its 
passing, there IS a harsh reality to 
face - ,ummcr IS trul} over and 
... Iacking off musl (omc til a halt. As 
UCS D slUdents, 11 IS II me 10 reach 
OU( and pe rform at the level of IICII-

Insi liull on demands ... or some-
thmg. 

The truth IS. folks . that for many 
of us. there 's a dlseas~ OUI Ihere 
thai we thought we had dcfealed 
ycars carl ier. 11 \ hack In lull lorce 
and worse than ever - ,lIld If ",e 're 
not carelu!. 11 will crush us wllh lis 
hornlY111g wrath. 

The ,oun:e of our ulfllction IS 
,enlOri ll~ . Remcmher that hlissl'ul 
slacking pnvllege we wcre granted 
during our final yea r of' hi gh 
school '! Our grade~ didn' l lTIaller 
anymorc. II' we were m:cepted into 
college, we were ou l 10 lunch -
di lching class, forsaking homework 
and ignoring Ihe good word of our 
teachers. 

Those sure arc some grea( mem-
ories, aren ' t they'! 

Then ca rne college. and all that 
hard work slarted up agai n. 
Studying was in. partying was oul 
(Yeah, thai ', the ticket). Once we 
all got our hUllS in gear. some of us 
were able to keep our pnorilies in 
order; we can huckle down when 
we need to and gel to hUS111es., . 
Although wc may nol do as well in 
,omc of' our clas,,~, as wc 'd like to, 
wc still develop a haslc roullne to 
cope with a co llege life and jugglc 
a wllege workload. 

BUI look out. You can ncvcr 
truly cscape Ihe terri hie malady 
known as ~en l ori ti s . I have fallen

The cure for 
senlGrltls Is to gut-
check and get it 
together. Easier said 
than done, I am 
aware. A swift kick 
to your own 
posterior Is in order. 
If you can't do it 
yourself, ask a 
friend, colleague or 
random stranger off 
the street to do It 
for you.

understand why he rates a three -
he doesn't care about your prob-

rush answers to your questions. 

What thi s professor's behavior 
indicates is that he is too busy to be

The Professor Who Genuinely 
C ... 

This is the educator every stu-
dent dreams of and gets a rating of 
I on the ego scale. A professor who 
cares behaves in a way that is 
indicative of self-confidence, but 
not self-absorption. 

The Professor Who Genuinely 
Cares makes an effort to help stu-
dents by advising them on ways to 
beller study course materials, 
makes himself available for student 
questions regularly (not just during 
offi ce hours), I:onsiders students as 
individuals that learn differently 
and volunteers information about 
careers in the field in which the 
course is offered. 

He shows a genuine interest in 
hi s students indicating he respects 

seni ori ti s, no pill , no injection and 
no inhaled, gaseous, odorless and 
colorless substance. 

The cure for senioritis is to gut-
check and get it together. Easier said 
than done, I am aware. A swift kick 
to your own postenor is In order. II' 
you can 't do it yourself, ask a friend , 
colleague or random stranger off the 
street to do it for you. 

Just think , there is a promised 
land at the end of four years of 
wandering through the collegiate

them, understands that everyone 
starts at the beginning and remem-
bers that he was once a student, too. 
For a person to understand all that 
and then act on it, his ego must be 
under control . 

Certainly, you can understand 
the differences in these types of 
instructors and recognize the neces-
sity to include the ego scale in 
C.A.P.E. Of course, if our professors 
actually read this, maybe they' ll be 
motivated to change their attitude 
toward students - assuming that 
their egos don't obstruct their view. 

A special thank you 10 all of 
those educators who really, truly 
care and make a difference in the 
lives of their students everyday by 
giving us direction and helping us 
understand the material that they 
themselves are so passionate about.

There are thousands out there just

feel you r pain. There arc probably a 
few 12-step programs out there to

Cinema On The Edge 
Experimental films play in La lalla 

By Sara Moosavi 
Staff Writer 

Experimental lilrns are usually 
regarded as stepping stones for film 
students who aspire to be the next 
Steven Spcilberg or Oliver Stone. 
Many of these films, though, are 
also a means to an end in themselves 
- art simply for the sake of an. 

The Museum of Contemporary 
Art is showcasing experimental 
films in "Performance Anxiety," 
which will include the film series 
"Making a Spectacle of the 
Audience." The series is presented 
on Wednesday evenings at 7:30 
p.m. through Nov. 19. 

The focus of "Making a 
Spectacle of the Audience" is to 
highlight the audience's involve-
ment in the films. Each night has a 
specific theme, such as 
"Survei Ilance Cu Itu re/Survey i ng 
Culture" and "Playtime: Fusing 
Performance and the Everyday." 

Most of the lilms are unknown, 
at least to those who are unfamiliar 
with the experimental film genre. 

Among the films shown is Vito 
Acconci's "Theme Song," in 
which Acconci pleads with the 
camera in a disturbingly sexual yet 
frankly honest manner to "join 
him." All the film shows is 
Acconci, in his "burnt -out" '70s 
style , smoking cigarettes and 
changing records (or is it 8-
trach'I) . It possesses chari sma and 

draws in the viewer. 
ot all of the films are a~ 

intriguing. "Ocularis: The Eye 
Surrogatc~" focuscs on surveil -
lance tCl,;hnology and its effects on 
people; however, 21 minutes of 
surveillance lilm footage and com-
pletely unrelated narratives wears 
on the viewer. 

"John Porter Presents Super-8 
Projection Performance" cele-
brates the work of experimental 
filmmaker John Porter; 20 of his 
films are shown. The films range 
from one to fi ve minutes, and run 
like mangled home movies. Still, 
much like the now-infamous black 
circle painted against a blank white 
canvas, it is considered an. 

These films are not like the typ-
ical Hollywood production with a 
big budget, big-name stars, a plot 
and re olution . However, this festi -
val does showcase experimental 
film, and allows the viewer to pon-
der the meaning of art in contem-
porary society. 

"Making A Spectacle of the 
Audience" will be screened in the 
Museum's Sherwood Auditorium 
located at 700 Prospect Street. 
Tickets are $4 for general admis-
sion and $2 for MCA members, 
students and seniors. Ticket-hold-
ers are invited to tour the exhibi-
tion prior to the screenings. For 
more information call MCA at 
454-3541 .

On TIle Town: Pacific Theatres will open the Gaslamp 15, a brand 
new cinema complex in the heart of the Gaslamp Quarter. 

Pacific Gaslamp 15 Opens 
New complex brings back the glamour 
By Scott Yaeer 
Co-Hiatus Editor 

In an effon to revive the glitz 
and glamour of the movie palaces 
of the '20s and '30s, Pacific 
Theatres will open the brand new 
IS-screen Gaslamp Theatre tomor-
row in the hean of the Gaslamp ' 
Quarter. Mixing antiquity with the 
latest technology, the Gaslamp IS 
will provide a welcome addition to 
the core of San Diego's downtown 
nightlife. 

The $15 million , 73,000 
square-foot facility features archi-
tectural themes that embody the 
glamorous t.radition of the old 
movie houses, and combines them 
with the elegant stylings charac-
terized by the Gaslamp Quarter. 

Inside, the theme continues with 
wood and brass detailing, ushers 
in period uniforms and managers 
in tuxedos. 

Aside from the antique decor, 
the Gaslamp IS provides the latest 
theater developments, such as wall-
to-wall screens and tiered stadium 
seating throughout the complex. 
Each theater features the popular 
high-back seats with individual 
cupholder~ and retractable armrests 
which have spread through theaters 
across America. The Gaslamp 15 
also offers the latest in film projec-
tion and ~ound technology wilh 
SDDS , DTS and Dolby Digital 
Sound.

might expect. Classics like "The 
Girl From Ipanima" and other jazz 
standards are manipulated within 
the band's own aggressive tunes. 

Croce's Jazz Bar is relatively 
small with a crowd made up of 
people in their 20s and 30s. The 
sparse seating arrangements are 
irrelevant since the music is the 
kind that makes one want to get up 
and dance. Another plus offered 
by the intimate set-up is the ability 
to get within two feet of the band 
during its performam;e. 

"I Jove it when people crowd 
around," Riddle said. " It means 
they 're enjoying the music. It 's 
fun to have people right there 

HI 

because you can look them in the 
face. " 

According to Riddle , the 1110St 
requested songs are jazz stan-
dards- music by Antonio Carlos 
Jobim, su~h a.~ "Wave" and old 
songs from Mexico. Of the latter 
category, Santana songs like "Oye 
Como Va," "Black Magic 
Woman" and "Europa" are the 
most requested. Arguably the 
house favorite is an old Dizzy 
Gillespie tune, "Soul Sauce" and 
dubbed "Chupacabra" (goat suck-
er). 

Yavaz started out playing just 
one night a week at Croce's. Not 
about to let go of something so 
popular, Croce's made them the 
lirst band ever to play Thursday, 
Friday and Saturday nights for two 
consecutive months. 

Although the band has been 
together for the past three-and-a-

The UCSD Guardian 

half years, its first CD was pro-
duced in May, so their success is 
"brand-spanking new." 

Oritz married and gave up his 
musical career in the early '70s. It 

wa~n't until 20 years later guitarist 
Jaime Vayez convinced him to 
pick up the congas once more. It 
was during thi~ period of musical 
reawakening that Oritz and Riddle 
were introduced when a mutual 
friend suggested they get together 
to "jam for the hell of it" in a 
garage band . 

"Nelson and I realized we had a 
good thing going and that's how 
we staned officially," Riddle said. 

The rest is history. 
The group is tight, carrying on 

a wave of energy that emanates 
from Riddle and Oritz. Riddle is 
quick to praise Oritz, crediting 
him with the band's success. 

He also praises the rest of the 

members' talent and respect for 
one another. 

The feeling, said Oritz, is a 
mutual one. In fact, for Oritz, one 
of the best things about Yavaz is 
working with Riddle. They share 
what he calls a brother-type love. 

In addition, the members of the 
band work well together. 

"We don ' t have any ego 
trips," Riddle said. "We do music 
because we love music, not 
because we want to get a big 
head. I don't consider myself 
something special. God gave me 
a gift. He gave all of us a gift. 
Some people have to develop it 
and some people were born with 
it." 

At the relatively low cost of $5, 
or free entrance with dinner (no 
minimum), Yavaz arc both enjoy-
able and affordable. For Illore 
information, call 233 -4355.

***** 

The Dave Matthews Band put 
logether an impressive resume with 
its two multi -platinum albums, 
Under the Table and Dreami/lg and 
Crash . Any true fan of the quintet 
knows, though, that the band 's 
strength lies in its dynamite live 
shows. 

With the release or Live at Red 
Rocks, it becomes clear to all fans, 
new and old, that the Dave 
Matthews Band is one Ihe best li ve 
acts thi s side of its hometown of 
Charlottesville, Va. This Iwo-CD 
set, recorded in Denver two sum-
mers ago, and seven months before 
the release of Crash, is the hand at 
its absolute best. 

The set kicks off with a 13 112-
millute version of "Seck Up," a 
tribal ja/l-rusion track Ihat was 
recorded previously on the hand\ 
1993 indie- Iabel re l ea~c, 
Rememher Two Things. The audi -
ence i~ immcdiately smacked in the 
face wi th the hand 's sorhi~ticated 
melodic!> and rhythll1\ which com-
hlne worldwide influen ce~ . 
Especially IIltrigui ng arc LeRoi 
Moore Oil saxophom: and Boyd 

Tinsley on violin. Another track off 
Remember Two Things, 
"Recently," is equally stunning. 

Other high points include a 
mind-blowing "Ants Marching" 
with an extended solo-filled intro. 
Also from Under the Table is 
"Dancing Naneies," back-to-back 
with the calypso-laden 
"Warehouse." 80th songs are band 
favorites that feature the ensemble 
melding together exquisitely. 

Some of Ihe most interesting 
tracks on the recording arc those 
from Crash which appear in 
embryoni c versions . One of 
those , 'Two Step," even has dif-
fen.: nt lyrics, as frontman 
Mauhews had obviously not set-
tled on the linal words at the time. 
"Lie in Our Graves" is another 
standout in the same fashion, till 
a riveting song despite its infant 

imperfecti on~ . 
If you can't catch the Dave 

Mallhews Band li ve, you 're miss-
ing out on a jaw-dropping experi-
ence. Live al Red Rocks is the next 
best thing - a welcome addi tion to 
any CD co llection.

People Mover. the follow-up to 

The Elevator Drops' 1996 release, 
Pop Bus, does not demonstrate any 
sort of musical maturity or defini-
tive style. Rather, it is a hodge-
podge of .eelectic, clanging 
approaches successfully styled by 
other anists and groups, but cer-
tainly not by The Elevator Drops. 

Begging attention for "their 
style" of wearing painted faces 
while singing peculiar pop-rock 
anthems backed by synthesized 
sounds might sound like a hip 
idea, but The Elevator Drops just 
are not able 10 pull off such a 
stunt. 

In short , People Mover stri ve, 
to set some sort of anti-trend under 
the gui se of anistic freedom of 
expression and parity of vision. 
However, it seems that the bottom 
line has dropped out of this so-
called eccentric elevator.

COlilpany rio" had from the 
lower ea,t ,ide of Manhattan . 
The) ha ve released Iheir first full -

length album, Funcrus!Jer Plus , on 
their own label, Official 
Recordings . 

This album contains 19 tracks 
with original styles and no fancy 
packaging. These are tracks that 
don 't sell their audience's intelli-
gence short; for inslance, they have 
lyrics like "Your insanity is my 
clarity, nol to mention , convention 
is a great war weaponIWho stands, 
who falls7/0n Ihe wack, I keep tabs 
like Timothy Leary and/or 
ASCAP/Catch a smack to the face 
on principle, even when I say noth-
ing, it's a beautiful usc of negative 
space." 

Company Flow utili ze lyrics 
without the repetitive choruses and 
hooks. These standard arrange-
ments over raw, original tracks arc 
a shining example of what a little 
c reativity and originality can 
accomplish_ 

Along with S.K.E. (See Know 
Evil ), The Vinyl Re-Animators, 
Juggaknots, Kool Keith, Non 
Phixion and Fat Beats, genuine hip-
hop is back . Now who's hot, who's 
not?

REGGAE: 
Feel the beat with 
Common Sense 
Continued from Pac. 14 
even make that album for 
Virgin, we made it for Surfdog, 
so (lhink Virgin's going to push 
this next album as if il were their 
own; I lhink we'll have a real 
chance with the next one. 
You've played a lot in San 
Diego In the last few 
years, how does it feel 
cominc back after touring 
around the country? 

Two months is probably the 
longesl we've ever not played 
San Diego in the last ~'even 
years. When we came back 
everything was packed. we had 
a great show at 4th & B; there 
were probably 1,500 people and 
that was really a ni ce surpri se. 
The Belly Up is always packed, 
which is also ni ce. 

It was great coming back 
hecause our fans missed us a lit-
tle bit. They didn 't take us lor 
granted as much, not that Ihey 
do take us for granted, hut Ihey 
come and just drink and not yell 
anJ stuff after awhile because 
they would just cOllie and see us 
all the lime. Once ' we were 
gone, they came back and were 
really supponive and we tOlally 
appreciate that. 
What are your plan5 for 
the future besides the 
new album? 

I think we 'd like 10 ju~t May 
Irave ling aild lOuring as mllch as 
poss ible, :l nd get around the 
country and get Ollt of 
Californi a. We'll always he here 
because we live here, so we'd 
like 10 try to keep rromoting 
ourselves nalionally and interna-
lionally as soon as possible.

KARMA: 
The bird is dead, but 
the Lakers are not . 
Continued from page 20 

Fim of all , let 's talk about the 
defend ing champ~, the Chicago 
Bulls. It 's easy to say that they will 
win the title again. It 's probably the 
last season that Mike, Phil , Scottie 
and Dennis will all be together, and 
they're going to be motivated to 
wi n, right? Wrong. I say thi . year is 
their meltdown year. 

Pippen 's injury IS forcing Mike 
to run the show, and he is going to 
get very greedy. By the time Pippen 
is hea lthy, Mike is not going to be 
happy about giving up the ball. 
Then the teammates will get into 
repeated spats, forcing Phi I 
Jackson to take sides and make him 
into a bad guy. 

The baddcst guy will , of course, 
be Rodman. His antics ceased to be 
entertaining years ago, and thi s 
year I anticipate trouble with the 
law. Maybe an indecent exposure 
infraction of some sort. Yeah, that 's 
what we really want to see, 
Rodman's other dyed hair .. . 

So, who's going to win it this 
year? The Lakers. 

Oh yeah, I hear all the detractors 
saying, "Del Harris' crew is too 
young, too undisc iplined, and Shaq 
can't win the big games." 

I say this Laker team will gel 
together and be unstoppable. Nick 
Van Exel, the gangsta hoopa, is not 
goi ng to tone down his act this 
year, but he will still be the fiery 
leader of thi s team. He is going to 
change hi s game to fit the ski lls of 
his immensely talented teammates 
and that will work wonders for 
everyone's gamc. Del realizes this, 
and their relallonship wi ll not be 
stralncci. 

Now let 's talk ahout Shaq. Say 
what you wa nt about this guy, but I 
like the fact that he pi mp-s lapped 
Greg Ostertag. 

Lct'" face it - the age of the 
NBA nice guy IS OUI. Jordan is run-
ning ou t of timc, Karl Malone and 
John Stock ton were so ni cc they arc 
annual choke arti sts and David 
Robinson is so nicc he' ll never ~ee 
a championship banner. Hakecm 
still has tons of game. but is obvi-
(lus ly a dying breed. 

The new breed of NBA super-
Mar has to have a wi Id side. Charles

behind the service line and prompt-
ly ended any chance of a Cal Lu 
win, 

Bender put together an impres-
sive run of II straight service 
points, including three aces, that 
suddenly had the Tritons thinking 
sweep. 

Thursday, November 6, 1997 

Barkley showed that when he 
to~sed that midget through a win-
dow. What did the NBA do? It sup-
ported Barkley. The precedent has 
been set - make way for the trash-
ta lk ing, weed-smoking, midget-
tossi ng super~tars. 

When Shaq made Ostertag look 
like a lillie gi rl , despite all the bad 
press , I think his teammates liked 
it. Shaq and the boys arc not going 
to take guff from anyone this year 
and they will win the whole damn 
thing. 

Now, about this proposed Eddie 
Jones for Mitch Richmond trade. I 

~ay don't worry Laker fans, Jerry 
West is smarter than anyone else on 
the planet. Whatever he does will 
be the right move. With either play-
er the Lakers can win, so don ' t be 
upset if Eddie leaves L.A. 

As for the other contenders: 
New York Knicks - These 

guys are the roughest, toughest 
group of players in the league. 
Don't be surprised if Patrick Ewing 
and the boys lake the Eastern 
Conference title away from the 
Bulls. If they don't win it, they ' ll 
probably steal it, anyway. 

Houston Rockets - Just crafty 
enough to surprise the Lakers ... but 
that 's a long time from now, and 
who knows, those guys are so old 
they might not live that long. 

Seattle Sonics - Vin Baker has 
serious game, and I think they will 
be strong, but finish will third in the 
Pacific Division. 

Phoenix Suns - I think the 
Suns are the surprise team of the 
year. They are going to run and gun 
all year, and now that they have an 
inside presence in Antonio 
McDyess, watch out. I'm seeing 
them in the Conference 
Championship against L.A. 

Miami Heat - Scrappy win-
ner~, hut the Knicks will wait until 
hoth teams get outside of the gym 
to brawl this year. 

Utah Jazz - Yeah right. The 
JaZi could chok e agai nst my 
[ntramural team. 

San Antonio Spurs - Sec 
above. 

So that's the preview. Take it to 
the hank : Lakers in six over New 
York. 

Of course. anyone who knows 
the Coach knows that I've just 
ji nxed both teams into mediocri ty, 
bu t hey, ['ve got to get lucky some-
time. 

With a revived Triton defense 
leading the way, Strube pelted the 
Regals for eight unanswered points 
and sank any hope on the Cal Lu 
sideline. 

While the Regals did manage to 
sideout, Salter and Brynjestad 
made sure that there would be no 
comebacks this night. Both put 
away back-row kills and 
Brynjestad served an ace to make it 
match point. Sophomore Jen 
McLain split the Regal defense to 
close out the Triton win, 15-4. 

The Regals did manage to 
scrape together some points to 
make things interesting, but a huge 
kill down the line by junior 
Katherine Brynjestad shut the doot 
on the Regals and had the Tritons 
up two games to none. 

With the win, No. 5 ranked 
UCSD improved its overall record 
to 20-5 and remains undefeated 
against Division TIl opponents lhis 
season. 

Again, just when things were 
going according to plan, the Regals 
got pesky, 

UCSD opened the third looking 
shaky, and the Regals were bat-
tling. But again it was tough serv-
ing that made the difference for the 
Tri tons. This time it was junior 
middle blocker Dena Strube who 
handled the serving duties. 

As the top-ranked team in the 
Western Region, the Tritons are 
likely to be named hosts of the 
Regional Playoffs and can secure 
that position with a win against 
Chapman University on Saturday 
night. 

The Panthers, whom UCSD has 
already beaten once this year, arc 
ranked second in the West and the 
match shOUld provide a playoff pre-
view.

For the lucky mem-

ICE HOCKEY ... 
When thinking of things to do 

on a Saturday night in San Diego, 
ice hockey docsn 't usually come to 
mind. After all, where is the ice? 

W h i I e 

\ 
Minnesota 
natives might 
~ ha ve an idea, 
~ most native San 

Diegans wouldn't 
know a sheet of icc if they fe ll on it. 

However, the people at the San 
Diego SportS Ar.::na somehow 
knew and were treated to a great 
game between UCSD and SDS U. 

Even though UCSD ultimately 
lost the game !I-5, fans were treated 
to some fantasti c plays. 

Those hoods from SDSU 
jumped Ollt to an early 3-0 lead 
before UCSD's own legion of 
doom decided it was time to play. 

Lawrence Chan, Bhavin Mheta, 
Eric Borman and Noby Itakura all 
scored goals in the second period Thumbing her nose at the com-

petlllOn in the Ad vanced

teammate Erika Wiseman taki ng 
third place in the Beginning

Wilson rounded out UCSD's 
results with a second-place in the 
Walkffrot elass. 

Rugby - who cares? The 
Guardian cares. Most students 
would too, if they had watched a 
game. Bes ides, it 's the 
closest thing UCSD ha:~ 

coasted down the right ~idcline 
and fed Brian Kennedy, 
who was trailing the 
play, a perfect pass to 
break up the shutout.

The San Diego City 

Intercollegiate Rugby 
Championships took 
place last Saturday with UCSD 
matching wits with a couple of 
Division I studs, placing second 
in the championships. 

In the first game of the day, 
UCSD matched lip against the 
hated Aztecs of San Diego State. 
It looked bleak early in the sec-
ond half as they were on the 

conversion and the score was 12-
7. 

Those bloody Aztecs tired 
right back, though. with a try of 
their own which extended their 
lead to 17-7. 

Wilga added three points to 
cut the deficit to seven, but the 
ruggers could not pull off the

The men of La Jolla fell 
behind again, giving up it second 
try before the half, making the 
score 12-5. 

In the second half, UCSD 
simply would not allow itself to 
lose, and scored a crucial try. 
With Wilga adding the two-point 
conversion, the 17-16 lead was 
theirs for good.

Sadly, UCSD could not contin-
ue their roll as SDSU owned the 
third period and went on to win by 
a final score of 8-5. 

"We were in it the whole game, 
but we gave up a lot of soft goals 
and committed some bad penal-
ties," Coach Shawn McCoy said. 
"Otherwise, this has been the best 
we've ever played against them." 

The crowd support didn 't hurt 
the squad either. Come out and 
watch UCSD break the ice.

Dead Birds and an 
NBA Preview? 

OK kiddIC~ , Il \ ,tory time. 
Before I hcgin my Wec<.:h about 
how the Lo ... Angeb. Laker~ arc 
goi ng to pummel thc rc~ t 01 the 
NBA thl ~ yea r, let mc tell you a 
story about go lf. 

A friend of mine and [ went 
to an undisdosed driving range 
last Saturday to try and work off 
our hangovers. Halloween wa~ 
the night before and somebody 

• tricked us into drinking an 
undisclosed amount of akohol. 

We were doing our feeble 
best to hit , while a 75-year-old 
wheelchair-ridden geriatric with 
severe arthriti~ wa~ laughing at 
our feeble effort s. My good 
friend was in the habit of ~crap­
ing the ground wllh every ball . 

So, naturally he is prelly 
upset , and he takes out what I 
believe was a low iron, maybe a 
three (remember, I was hung-
over and still not completely 
functional - hey, it was early, 
like 2 p.m.). 

He rears back and <.: rushes 
the baU. Of course. it was only a 
<.:ouple inches off the ground, 
but it was humming. J turned 
around to get another club and I 
heard a distinct rustle. I turned 
back around to him and he had 
this confused look on his face . 

"Did you see that?" he said. 
"No, what happened? 
") just killed a bird." 
"You WHAT?" 
I looked over to the spot 

where he had hit and there was a 
group of pigeons there. One was 
on its side, with feathers sur-
rounding it. I wasn't convinced, 
however, so I walked out there. I 
scared all the birds away, but 
one just stayed there, with a golf 
ball next to it. 

Sure enough, he killed the 
damn thing. It might have been 
taking a nap, but I doubt it. We 
looked at each other, shook our 
heads and then broke out into 
furious laughter. 

Of all the times I've been 
golfing, I've seen some really 
drunk people do some really 
drunk things. I've been in golf 
carts where people kick "sun-
roofs" into the roof. I've seen 
golf clubs and people fa ll into 
lakes. But I've never seen any-
thing DIE on a course. 

It gets worse. To add to our 
already-positive karma, we had 
a chipping contest to see who 
could hit the dead bird. Just 
when you thought it couldn't get 
more twisted, we're beating on 
this poor bird's corpse. By the 
way, I won the contest. 

Speaking of winning, J do 
believe the Los Angeles Lakers 
are 2-0. Since the NBA is back, 
I filUre I should give you bums 
the Coach's preview of the 
upcoming season:

Tritons Will Begin Title Defense At Home 
RECIIONAU: The two-time defending National Champions will take the field Saturday at 5 p.m. 
By Seen RIIIIImI 

.Senior Staff *iter 
It's true, the real sea-

son for the UCSD 
women's soccer team has 
just begun. 

The Tritons will host 
the Western Regionals of 
the NCAA Division III 
playoffs this weekend at 
Triton Soccer Stadium. 

Division III rival Cal Lutheran 
will square off against 
Gustavus Adolphus in 
Saturday'S first match at 
2:30 p.m. followed by 
UCSD facing off against 
University of Chicago -
participants in last year's 
Final Four - at 5 p.m. 

The winners will play 
Sunday afternoon for the 

right to advance. 
"We just have to get focused," 

Triton Head Coach Brian 
McManus said. ''The first home 
game is always tough, but hopeful-
ly we have enough girls that have 
been there before to look after the 
younger players. I'm sure the fresh-
man will play loose and have fun. 
We just need to take it one game at 
a time." 

Regarding arch-rival Cal 
Lutheran, McManus said, "It's a 
real shame that Cal Lutheran is in 
our group. I firmly believe that if
