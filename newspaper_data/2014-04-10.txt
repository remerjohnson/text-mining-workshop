VOLUME 47, ISSUE 44 THURSDAY, APRIL 10, 2014 WWW.UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

Multiple grievances were filed 
against the Let’s Act! slate,  and one 
against  Tritons Forward, for breaking 
campaigning rules on Tuesday, April 8 
and Wednesday, April 9. Let’s Act! was 
found guilty of one of the accusations, 
two of the grievances were dropped 
and the rest have yet to be reviewed. 

The first two grievances were 
filed by Triton’s Forward presidential 
candidate Robby Boparai. One accused 
the Let’s Act! slate of collaborating 
with Muir College Council slate 
GLAD due to GLAD’s endorsement 
of Let’s Act! However, according to 
Let’s Act! presidential candidate Kyle 
Heiskala, Let’s Act! never asked for this 
endorsement.

“The GLAD slate was in accordance 
with their college council bylaws, and 
they had the necessary approval,” 
Heiskala said. “We were following all 
the rules to our knowledge.”

However, members of the Let’s 
Act! slate advocated for GLAD from 
their personal Facebook pages, which 
Heiskala defined as a “gray area.” Let’s 
Act! was found guilty; the sanction 
says: “The election committee defines 
complicit alignment as intentional 
sharing of any candidate or slate 
campaign material including via social 
media or in person.” 

Heiskala will issued a public apology 
via his Facebook page to reach the 
same population that the original 
GLAD endorsement had.

“I apologize for sharing a photo of 
GLAD via facebook when I should 
not have,” Heiskala posted around 
9 p.m. last night. Boparai filed this 
grievance because in previous years, 
super slates between A.S. Council 
slates and college council slates were 
very successful, and they were banned 
for this year’s election.

“At least a portion of [their success] 
has to be because of the overwhelming 
support,” Boparai said. “It captivates 
the people in colleges who might not 
make it out to Library Walk. I want to 
make sure the election goes fairly.”

The second grievance that Boparai 
filed concerned a mass email that 
Let’s Act! sent out. According to 
the election code, slates cannot use 
a student organization’s lists to send 
campaign material. However, Heiskala 
contended that the email addresses 
were found on public websites, and 
Let’s Act! was found not guilty. 

Triton’s Forward candidate for Vice 
President Finances and Resources 
Igor Geyn filed the third grievance. 
It accused Let’s Act! of using glossy 
paper for campaign posters, which, 
according to Boparai, is illegal. Let’s 
Act! was found not guilty.

The final grievance has not yet 
been reviewed and has a hearing 
pending. Stephanie Sayegh, who is 
not associated with Triton’s Forward, 
filed the grievance. A Facebook post 
from the Tritons Forward Facebook 
page about their new pins received a 
comment from Let’s Act! candidate for 
Campus-wide Senator Seraphin Raya.

The transportation referendum 
will officially appear in a special elec-
tion ballot during Week 8 of Spring 
Quarter 2014 after the final language 
was approved by the Graduate Student 
Association on Monday, April 7. 

It was originally scheduled to 
appear in a special election during 
Winter Quarter 2014, but the Vice 
Chancellor and Chancellor’s offices 
were not satisfied with the content of 
the referendum, calling it too ambigu-
ous. The referendum was then rewrit-

ten with the exact benefits detailed and 
the price lowered and was scheduled 
to appear on the general election ballot 
Week 2 of Spring Quarter 2014. 

But due to what was largely 
reported as revisions from the UC 
Office of the President, the referen-
dum was once again pushed to a later 
date. However, GSA President Rahul 
Kapadia explained at the meeting 
that the referendum was pushed back 
due to omitted sentences that were 
required by the GSA and the A.S. 
Council constitutions. 

When a referendum is being writ-
ten within the UC, UCOP reviews 
potential referenda and gives advice 

on the language. However, none of 
its recommendations are necessarily 
mandated if the author of the referen-
dum can clarify a discrepancy.  

“In general, UCOP looks at refer-
endums as a courtesy,” UC spokesper-
son Brooke Converse told the UCSD 
Guardian. “This courtesy is to ensure 
that there are no mistakes in language 
that could invalidate a referendum.”

ASUCSD MOVES Director Kyle 
Heiskala explained that changes 
advised by UCOP led to the omis-
sion of phrases necessary in all 
referenda by GSA and A.S. con-

A SILVER LINING
UCSD is implementing an online registeration system for the Sun God Festival 2014 to shorten the long wait for wristbands. 

Above, lines for wristbands extended from Thurgood Marhsall College to Earl Warren College prior to the festival in 2011. 

With the 2014 Sun God Festival only six weeks away, A.S. Concerts and Events announced via Facebook on April 8 
that the festival will use a new online wristband 
distribution and registration system. Students will 
be able to begin registering for wristbands online on 
May 8 and must pick them up at Marshall Field on 
Thursday, May 15 — the day before the festival. 

ASCE Festivals coordinator Sean Kennedy said that 
the group aims to improve the event by streamlining 
ticketing, as well as increasing student safety and 
accountability, through the new ticketing registration. 

The new wristbands for Sun God Festival 2014 
will feature a printed barcode that can be scanned to 
access information provided by the student during 
the online registration.

Under the new distribution system, eligible 
undergraduates will be able to reserve a wristband 
online after registering with their name, phone 
number, local address and emergency contact 
information. In the case of an emergency, authorities 
will be able to access this information by scanning the 
wristband’s barcode. Additionally, ASCE is preparing 

a brief health and safety video highlighting Sun God 
changes and explanations to recap students as a 
component of the registration process.

Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student Life Gary 
Ratcliff said he supports the new wristband system 
and is confident in this year’s festival’s overall quality.

“The new system will be an added convenience to 
the student,” said Ratcliff. “Students can feel assured 
that they will have a ticket.”

ASCE also believes the new registration process 
will benefit undergraduates picking up their tickets. 
Instead of skipping class or work to line up on 
Marshall Field like previous years, students will be 
able to pick up their reserved wristbands between 10 
a.m. and 9 p.m. on Thursday, May 15.

“Previous years have followed a ‘first come, first 
serve’ kind of process,” Kennedy said. “This will 
hopefully cut down the lines to pick up tickets, 
while the technology tied to the wristband will 
prevent scalping.”

Kennedy also said some students fear that moving 
the ticketing process online may cause servers to 
crash when a multitude of students attempt to register

UCSD researchers discovered 
compelling evidence for the role that 
the body’s immune response plays in 
proliferating and destroying cancer 
cells through the use of “immunosur-
veillance” — the process of monitoring 
how the immune system detects or kills 
cancer cells. UCSD researchers’ find-
ings revealed that the level of antibod-
ies used against N-glycolylneuraminic 
acid (Neu5Gc) can either stimulate 
cancer progression or kill cancer cells.

According to an April 7 UCSD 
press release, “the difference between 
an immune response that kills cancer 
cells and one that conversely stimulates 
tumor growth” has a narrow range. 

UCSD Professor of Medicine and 
Cellular and Molecular Medicine 
Dr. Ajit Varki, along with his team 
of researchers, conducted a series of 
experiments to prove the hypothesis. 

Researchers injected antibiotics 
into a laboratory mouse that already 
had the Neu5Gc acid and a cancer 
tumor present, then observed the 
activities of cancer cells. Experiments 
showed that low levels of antibiot-
ics induced the mouse’s inflammatory 
response to fight against the antibiotics, 
resulting in tumor growth. However, 
high doses of antibiotics inhibited can-
cer cells from metastasizing.

The experiment was repeated with 
two other mouse tumor models, which 
gave rise to similar results. Dr. Varki 
generated an immune response curve 
or “inverse hormesis,” indicating the 
correlation between the levels of anti-
biotics in the mouse’s body and the 
number of cancer cells.

“[The graph shows a] linear and 
remarkably narrow range,” Varki told 
UCSD News. 

The curve could shift based on the 
quality of the immune response, illus-
trating Varki’s idea that “the immune 

system is a double-edged sword.”
These results surprised researchers 

because they show that the immune 
system can impact the formation of 
cancers, alter the progress of detected 
tumors and affect anti-cancer thera-
pies that use antibodies as a main form 
of treatment. 

Varki suggested that the findings 
could significantly impact cancer 
research and potentially have implica-
tions for future cancer prevention and 
treatment therapies. 

Varki’s findings were presented at 
the annual meeting of the American 
Association for Cancer Research in 
San Diego from April 5 to 9.

A report of the research was also 
published in the April 7 issue of 
the San Diego School of Medicine’s 
Proceedings of the National Academy 
of Sciences.

stitutions. These sentences were 
conditions of the referendum and, 
according to Heiskala, mostly were 
concerned with financial aid.

According to Kapadia, the 
absence of these necessary sentences 
was noticed by GSA Vice President 
of Internal Affairs Ted Stinson the 
day after GSA passed the referendum 
language. In order to comply with 
A.S. and GSA constitutional policies, 
the referendum language was revised 
and therefore had to be passed by 
A.S. Council, the GSA and the Vice 

Chancellor’s office for a third time, 
causing the delay.

“Balancing the extensive and, at 
times, contradictory requirements of 
these various agencies is a difficult task 
that could not have been accomplished 
without the cooperative efforts of 
numerous student government mem-
bers and university administrative offi-
cials,” Stinson said. “All the people who 
participated in this process are equally 
responsible for the excellent referen-
dum that will be presented to students 
for a vote this spring.”

Heiskala agreed that working with 
so many agencies led to unforeseen 

difficulties and time constraints. The 
abnormally large number of groups 
that the referendum was written or 
had to be approved by included A.S. 
Council, GSA, the Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs’s Office, the Vice 
Chancellor of Resource Management 
and Planning’s Office, the 
Chancellor’s Office, UCOP, MTS and 
Transportation and Parking Services.

Students will vote on the referen-
dum in a special election on TritonLink 
during Week 8.

“YAY! Congrats on the buttons, they 
look great!” Raya said in the Facebook 
comment. “Now you can stop asking 
people to take off Let’s Act! buttons.”

Raya said that this statement was not 
written maliciously, and thus he does 
not think the accusation is valid.

Sayeigh said she filed the grievance 
because “this is not the type of attitude 
or behavior I want my representatives 
and voice on this campus to have.”

Additionally, Eleanor Roosevelt 
College election manager Ellen Spicer 
filed a grievance against Let’s Act!, 
citing that “candidates, slate affiliates 
or those acting on their behalf may 

not campaign in any classroom or 
lab.” Lastly, Heiskala filed a grievance 
against Tritons Forward for the usage 
of duct tape for their posters.

The hearing for the final grievances 
will be held Thursday, April 10.

Council Discusses Sun God 
Wristbands, Graduation Debt

As I stumbled in late to the 
council meeting, Interim Vice 
Chancellor for Student Affairs 
Alan Houson was discussing the 
“no-host” policy that Sun God 
Festival has taken up this year, 
along with closing off Eleanor 
Roosevelt College.

The “no-host” policy mandates 
that only UCSD 
undergraduates 
are allowed to 
participate in 
Sun God. 

Houston 
answered questions from Transfer 
Senator Ricky Martorana on how 
the policy would be enforced and 
what will happen to students who 
lose their IDs.

Along with new policies on 
Sun God, students will be asked 
to register for the festival online 
by filling in their information 
and student PID, saving them the 
stress of waiting in line to receive 
a limited amount of tickets. The 
day of the festival, students will 
pick up a wristband with a barcode 
on it that is linked to their PIDs. 
Therefore, if student loses their 
IDs, they will have the wristband 
for backup.

After all the adult questions, VP 
Finance and Resources Sean O’Neal 
asked Houston on his music taste.

“There’s been a lot of question 
about Sun God,” O’Neal said. “If 
you could choose the headliner for 
Sun God, who would you choose?”

“If it was me, personally, 
Radiohead. If not Radiohead, The 
Clash,” Houston said. “Can we 
bring them back?”

Brownie points for Houston on 
his band choices!

A grant given to UCSD that has 
allowed the campus to maintain 
its mental health services is due to 

expire, raising concerns from VP 
External Affairs Vanessa Garcia 
on how to take action to allow 
the mental services to stay fully 
operational.

“What I’m really trying to 
coordinate is a statewide day of 
action,” Garcia said.

The remainder of the meeting 
focused on how 
the council will 
have to “dip into” 
UCSD’s Mandate 
Reserves to 
fund the 2014 

commencement ceremony, as 
well as other organizations and 
programs on campus.

Social Sciences Senator Colin 
King was one of the first to begin 
the discussion.

“I know how important it is for 
first-generation college students 
to have graduation services,” King 
said. “To deny people of that 
experience is more irresponsible of 
us then taking money out of our 
mandated reserves.”

Garcia responded to the the idea 
of taking money out of the mandate 
reserves, and its supporters, with 
frustration.

“This starts a slippery slope,” 
Garcia said. “I am not comfortable 
with dipping into mandate reserves.”

Revelle Senator Marco Vasquez 
agreed with Garcia.

“I do sympathize with graduating 
seniors, I am a graduating senior,” 
Vasquez said. “Just realistically, 
these funds are not going to be 
brought back in, and I think it’s 
irresponsible to see mandated 
reserves be brought down by 40 
percent.”

Well, I guess we’ll see what A.S. 
decides in the upcoming weeks. 
Until then, have a good week, 
fellow Tritons!

and reserve passes at the same time. 
ASCE has anticipated this concern and 
will not be using UCSD servers to 
support the festival’s online box office. 

“We’re currently working with 
programmers and computer scientists 
to prepare servers that will not crash 
when ticket registration opens,” 
Kennedy said.

ASCE has had its plate full this past 
year with working through budget 
deficits from the removal of guest 
passes while searching for health 
and safety solutions to preserve this 
year’s Sun God Festival. Despite 
concerns that a new wristband 

system would take a toll on the 
festival’s budget, ASCE notes that 
this is not actually the case.

“Last year, there had been a printed 
number on each wristband; instead, 
[this year] we’ll be printing a barcode, 
so costs for that won’t go up,” said 
Kennedy. “As for the infrastructure of 
the system, we’re working with people 
on campus so the costs aren’t as high.”

Meanwhile, many students are 
anxiously waiting for the release of 
this year’s lineup to see what this year’s 
festival has in store. Rumors have 
circulated that Los Angeles-based DJ, 
Diplo, may be performing at this year’s 
festival, due to an online advertisement 
of the artist’s upcoming tour dates that 

included a show at UCSD on May 16, 
the day of the Sun God Festival. 

Though ASCE has refused to 
comment on whether Diplo will be 
performing at the festival, ASCE plans 
to release a majority of this year’s 
festival lineup on April 18.

“The Chancellor and Assistant 
Vice Chancellor Gary Ratcliff want 
this year’s Sun God to be at the same 
level and caliber of last year’s festival,” 
Kennedy said. “Personally, I think 
this will be one of the best Sun God 
Festivals. We have a great lineup and 
cool surprises in store.”

As students, we are quick to complain about all the things that our campus is lacking, yet there always seems to be a lot of apathy when it comes to cast-
ing our votes in the elections. As students, it is not only our 
privilege, but also our responsibility to voice our opinions 
to the student government and make the campus a better 
place. In choosing not to do so, we are only doing a disser-
vice to ourselves and the school as a whole.

The election process at any level of government requires 
voter interest and participation. Unfortunately, UCSD has 
had a ridiculously low voter turnout of 22 percent for the 
past few years, which floats just above the required mini-
mum of 20 percent. Many students express their discontent 
when policy changes roll around but only have themselves 
to blame for choosing not to vote. Moreover, with such 
minimal student involvement, the few who actually do vote 
are not likely to accurately represent the student body. This 
makes it difficult for the student council to embody stu-
dents’ diverse opinions and beliefs.

One of the underlying issues is that most students 
don’t actually take the time to think about how much of 
their money is going straight to A.S. coffers. The A.S. 
budget is composed entirely of student fees, with approx-
imately 3 million dollars coming out of our pockets each 
year. Included in that figure is the salary of the A.S. pres-
ident, who makes $10,000 per year and gets a privileged 
parking spot, but whose name is unfamiliar to the over-
whelming majority of students. The fact that members 
of A.S. Council choose how to disseminate these funds 
should create an incentive to vote, since participating in 

the elections effectively allows us to choose the people 
whom we entrust with our student fees.

With their funding, resources and leadership, A.S. 
Council has a lot of potential to benefit students and 
improve the school. Our votes let the student government 
know what we want, whether it is cheaper buses or a bet-
ter Sun God Festival, and in turn allow it to act on our 
behalf. We are the ones that are going to be affected by 
policy changes, so we should step forward and take advan-
tage of the opportunity to have a say in them. Ultimately, 
A.S. Council has the students’ best interests in mind, but 
they can only address our needs if we provide them with 
input. If UCSD students continue to avoid elections, A.S. 
Council’s decisions will continue to reflect an extremely 
narrow demographic and set of beliefs. So go out and vote; 
it only takes five minutes on TritonLink. 

Confidential Council

Associated Students should ensure that voters have the opportunity to
educate themselves on A.S. Election issues ahead of  time.

Stank Face 
or Not,
She Might
Be Friendly 

hilary  lee hhl009@ucsd.eduRhyme  or  reason

When my professor instructed everyone to pair up with a nearby 
classmate, my heart sank as I looked 
up to see a girl in a familiar, orange 
hoodie lock eyes with me. I had 
shared every other class with this 
girl over the past four years but 
had never exchanged so much as a 
‘hello’ with her. She always has on 
what my Oakland-native roommate 
calls “stank face,” an unfortunate 
Popeye-like facial expression that 
makes her appear as if she’s perma-
nently in the proximity of a baby in 
an unchanged diaper. Not only did 
this render her a prime candidate for 
premature wrinkles, this also caused 
her to exude an unpleasant attitude 
that made me, even at that moment, 
automatically interpret her efforts at 
friendly eye contact as straight-up 
mad dogging.

Initial judgments play a very 
powerful role in how we treat others 
and how we ourselves are treated. 
We’ve always been taught not to 
judge a book by its cover, but the 
human brain is hardwired to make 
snap decisions. The moment you set 
your eyes on someone, your brain 
works like Wolfram Alpha to com-
pute that person’s levels of approach-
ability, competence and especially 
trustworthiness. Research has sug-
gested that it takes people a mere 
tenth of a second to form a com-
prehensive impression of a stranger 
based on his or her face.

Closing out potential friends with-
out even giving them a chance, how-
ever, is severely limiting. Friendship 
certainly isn’t marriage; it doesn’t take 
a huge commitment to simply return 
a friendly smile and open yourself 
up to people who could potentially 
become your next best friend. One of 
my closest friends currently has two 
full sleeves of tattoos that he has been 
building up since freshman year. If 
I had run into him for the first time 
today, I would have labeled him a no-
good hoodrat and scampered far, far 
away, never discovering how well our 
senses of humor gelled together. 

There are people at UCSD with 
whom you cross paths with every 
single day and have likely always 
wondered about. UCSD has its own 
version of Humans of New York 
called Portraits of UCSD, which was 
started by a biochemistry student 
last year and currently has over 1,500 
likes on Facebook. Perusing through 
this page, I was surprised at the num-
ber of fellow students I recognized — 
people I had merely brushed past at 
Porter’s Pub concerts or stood behind 
in line at Sunshine Market — and 
how their captions revealed aspects 
of their personality that I would have 
never guessed about them.

The Snapchats that my friend 
discreetly sends me of weirdoes in 
her class — including most recently 
a guy whose hair rivals Powerline’s 
from “A Goofy Movie” — will always 
be hilarious, but I now have a height-
ened awareness that the crafted 
personas we oftentimes unwittingly 
assign strangers are not necessarily 
indicative of their actual personali-
ties, as was the case with Stank Face. 
I’ll actually be seeking her out next 
time in lecture (although admittedly 
with the ulterior motive of eventu-
ally finding out what causes her face 
to look like that).

Student Votes Are Key to Effective A.S. Council

ILLUSTRATION BY ANNIE LIU

Lime green is this year’s color of choice for the campaign to get UCSD students to the “polls” to vote for our next round 
of student representatives on A.S. Council. 
But like with many premature fruits, the lime 
green may have meant “too soon” for the 
speed with which this year’s election was put 
together by Council’s impartial support staff.

First off, it took far too long for any stu-
dents to understand what was going to actually 
appear on the ballot. The UCSD Guardian 
originally reported that the long-awaited trans-
portation referendum (which, if passed, would 
raise student fees by about $50 per quarter 
to pay for the cost of a regional transit pass) 
would be front and center on this week’s ballot. 
After the language ping-ponged between A.S. 
Council, the Graduate Student Association, the 
University of California Office of the President 
and others, the proposition’s text was not final-

ized in time for this election. As a result, it will 
be delayed a few weeks and appear on the bal-
lot of a Week 8 special election.

Adding to the problem of the referendum’s 
absence from the ballot was that the transpor-
tation referendum’s omission was poorly com-
municated to the general campus community. 
On the A.S. Elections webpage, no mention 
of the transportation referendum or any item 
that wasn’t a candidate could be found. This 
is particularly unfair to voters on Monday 
who opened Tritonlink to find that there were 
two additional ballot items: the referenda on 
constitutional changes and a graffiti space. The 
lack of communication may have negatively 
impacted the student voter’s role in the elec-
tion process and resulted in confused, unin-
formed decisions.

There was no web mention of the main ref-
erendum that does appear in this week’s ballot 

— the constitutional amendments that would 
introduce new positions for international 
student senators and trim Council in other 
areas. Essentially, to know what was appearing 
on the ballot before Monday morning, a stu-
dent voter would have needed to been either 
on A.S. Council or in the Guardian office on 
Sunday during our annual endorsements issue 
planning. While the Guardian editorial board 
does in fact endorse a “yes” vote on the consti-
tutional changes, we think that having students 
unable to do their own background research 
on the proposed changes is a poor decision 
by A.S. Council election administrators. This 
oversight only dredges up bad memories of 
previous suspicious election manipulations by 
our student government.

In 2012, when A.S. Council prepared to 
release a ballot initiative that would raise 
student fees to fund a potential move to

Sample Ballots Enable Students to Make Informed Decisions

Dear Editor,
When I looked at Monday’s edi-

tion of the Guardian, I was shocked 
to discover that its coverage of last 
week’s TA strike — arguably the most 
significant event of that week — was 
relegated to a single photograph. The 
caption of which, by the way, incor-
rectly labeled the location as the front 
of Geisel Library and mentioned the 
“18-quarter restriction” without even 
explaining what that means. Really, 
Guardian? You can chastise us for 
disrupting your classes or thank us 
for supporting better undergradu-
ate education, but please at least say 
something substantive. Keep the dia-
logue running.

While I understand that gradu-
ate students aren’t exactly the 

Guardian’s intended audience — 
although the editors should know 
that the protests also represented 
undergraduate student work-
ers — the issues underlying many 
of our specific demands, namely, 
university forces that run counter 
to the quality of education students 
receive, are borne by all of us. And 
I would suggest that the resolution 
of these issues are more important 
than the results of the upcoming 
student election, notwithstanding 
whatever impact it may have on 
what second-rate musical acts get 
selected for Sun God. That said, I 
appreciate the participation in some 
activities of our strike by several 
members and supporters of “Let’s 
Act!,” and, if I could vote in this 
election, I would vote for that slate.

LETTER  TO  THE  EDITOR

TA Strike Should Have 
Received Better Coverage

THE GUARDIAN.
EMAIL YOUR LETTER TO OPINION@UCSDGUARDIAN.ORG

Division-I athletics, an internal 
memo that the Guardian discovered 
revealed that some supporters of the 
Division-I bill had told others to hide 
the fact that students would be voting 
on a fee increase. They hoped that 
by keeping publicity at a minimum, 
voters would be tricked into just 
supporting the referendum without 
considering the financial implications. 
Once word began to spread, a large 
“D-I Not Now” campaign sprung 
up to combat not only the initiative 
itself, but also the lack of information 
being distributed from the election 
managers themselves. To compare, 
the anti-Division-I movement began 
weeks before the election while the 

“Streamline A.S.” campaign to support 
this year’s referendum seems to have 
only cropped up in the past few days.

The simple solution: Provide stu-
dents with a sample ballot before the 
election actually begins to take place. 
Forcing students to do research on the 
ballot initiative in the middle of voting 
essentially prevents them from mak-
ing informed decisions. An impulsive 
vote on an issue such as the transpor-
tation referendum, for example, could 
have serious consequences. Voter edu-
cation will ultimately lead to strong 
representation and empowerment of 
the student vote.

However, there is praise due for 
the candidates this year in regard to 
inter-slate arguments. While last year’s 
top two slates exchanged roughly 

30 grievances that delayed election 
results, this year has, so far, been 
far more peaceful. By press time on 
Wednesday, only four grievances 
had been filed and one has been 
resolved. We applaud both Let’s Act! 
and Tritons Forward for keeping this 
election amicable and relevant to the 
issues the next Council will address.

The candidates for this year have 
made an incredible stride toward 
civility and the improvement of cam-
pus services and programs. Nearly 
all the candidates that the Guardian 
Editorial Board interviewed last 
week pledged to keep civility alive 
into their terms in office and to 
avoid slate politics. We’re all looking 
forward to a headache-free year on 
the fourth floor of Price Center.

The singer-songwriter genre is infamous for taking itself 
too seriously. But there’s only so much artsy wallowing even the 
most ironic hipster can take. Madeline Mann defies all precon-
ceived notions of what indie music should be — and does so 
with plenty of cheek.

“I have notebooks full of songs I wrote as a child about get-
ting in trouble, Anderson Cooper’s news reporting and trips to 
the grocery store — it was always total ridiculousness,” Mann 
told the Guardian.

Though Mann sonically takes from singer-songwriters like 
Mindy Gledhill and Taylor Swift, the vocalist, guitarist and 
ukuleleist stands out as a musical comic act all her own. Her 
signature wit even brought her a request from a geek dating site 
to make her tune, “Hot Guys with Four Eyes,” its theme song.

“I hope my music will leave listeners feeling cheerful, giddy 
and hopeful — basically the emotions you go through when 
you hear an ice cream truck,” Mann said.

The cello doesn’t get much representation in mainstream music. 
However, that doesn’t deter EMÆL from using cellos to make strides 
in indie rock that feels classy without being strictly classical. Featuring 
Emmanuel Ventura-Cruess’s guitar and cello, Mikko Pablo’s cello, 
Daniel Cristoff ’s drums, Alyssa Belle Cantal’s background vocals and 
the occasional vibraphone, the group is eclecticism incarnate.

“Being able to take [a song] to these different instruments really 
opens up the different possibilities that are within the music,” frontman 
Ventura-Cruess said.

Eschewing comparisons to other artists, the innovative band instead 
seeks to take its listeners on a cinematic, explorative musical journey.

“I just want to get the listeners thinking,” Ventura-Cruess said. “I 
want them to think about why music is so mystical. … I want them to 
think about themselves inwardly and what [they] are doing with their 
lives.”

It’s an ambitious goal, but with EMÆL’s sonic inventiveness, it is 
well within their reach.

  ATTLE OF THE BANDSB UNCLE JESSE
Written by Emily Bender  A&E Editorial Assistant

After meeting in class and bonding over their love for 
music (and dislike of CHEM 11), vocalist Philip Nekai, 
drummer Nick Geozian, bassist Kyle Binford and guitarist 
Alan McCaffrey formed Uncle Jesse.

Defining their sound is difficult, as they draw inspiration 
from all musical genres. The soulful vocals echo retro R ‘n’ B, 
while the melodic guitar strumming and spidery bass lines 
evoke contemporary indie rock and acoustic pop. Despite 
this potpourri of styles, their sound is cohesive. Their enthu-
siasm for making music, as well as their ability to channel 
their influences, is evident. Having rehearsed at KSDT Radio, 
Uncle Jesse aims to energize their audience at the Battle.

“Whether you like or dislike our music, our main goal is 
to make you remember us,” they said.

Regarding the band name reference to the ‘90s sitcom 
“Full House,” they are unfortunately not in touch with any 
uncles named Jesse at this point in time.

Today’s folk rock runs the risk of rehashing the sounds 
pioneered by the likes of Bruce Springsteen. However, Craig 
Marker is not interested in repeating old ideas.

“My major musical influences are members of the folk 
music movement,” Marker said. “I try to listen to the best 
songwriters. That way, I can improve my own ability to 
write songs.”

Keeping an open ear towards a range of genres that shape 
his sound, Marker cites both Macklemore and Garth Brooks 
as favorites.

Marker keeps things fairly simple, with little more than a 
guitar and light percussion. This barebones approach strips 
away unnecessary or otherwise distracting sonic barriers, 
helping him reach his goal of striking a chord with the listen-
er. With a focus on engaging melodies and personal lyrics, 
Marker exhibits the potential, as he puts it, to allow “music to 
make [an] important impact on people’s lives.”

S traddling the border between the dichotomies of mainstream and hipster music is no easy feat. But for long-time indie darling Ingrid Michaelson, 
clever and catchy tunes have won her both critical 
acclaim and mass recognition. With her sixth album 
“Lights Out,” however, 
Michaelson distances herself 
from the quaint ukulele riffs 
that escalated her to fame. 
Instead, the LP — her matur-
est yet — features resounding 
beats, refined pop melodies 
and Michaelson’s own stun-
ning, vocal range.

It’s not often that an 
album is able to cover such 
a range of sounds and yet 
achieve coherence through-
out, yet every track on 
“Lights Out” accomplishes 
this with flying colors. 
Whether she’s exploring 
loss in the electronica-
flavored “Stick” or celebrat-
ing strength in the uplifting 
“Afterlife,” Michaelson proves that she’s a musically 
and lyrically diverse powerhouse. Although the happy-
go-lucky ditties and schmaltzy ballads permeating her 
past albums are no longer present here, cheerful lead 
single “Girls Chase Boys” and the hard-hitting track 
“Warpath” will have addicted listeners, new and old, 
playing them on repeat, just as her past hits “Be OK” 
and “Everybody” had.

Though Michaelson can easily hold her own on 
every track, “Lights Out” showcases her most impres-
sive duets. “Wonderful Unknown” features her husband 
and fellow singer-songwriter Greg Laswell, whose slow 
bass vocals complement Michaelson’s introspective 
soprano. Sonically, the tune is similar to the melan-

choly often pervading Laswell’s usual repertoire but still 
retains a certain poignant whimsy that is Michaelson’s 
own flair. Livening up the record with Mat Kearney is 
“One Night Town,” whose disco-esque, carefree beats 
offer a new, fun-loving perspective on the two artists. 

But the guaranteed hit 
among the album’s many 
duets is “Over You,” 
Michaelson’s collaboration 
with A Great Big World. 
With its balladic tone and 
stripped-down piano mel-
ody, this is the tune that 
will break more hearts 
than “Say Something” 
ever did.

“Lights Out” is 
Michaelson’s best album, 
no question. It’s a deeply 
personal record that at 
times will make listeners 
question whether they 
are encroaching on her 
most intimate thoughts 
and feelings; yet it’s never 

cloying or exasperating like a diary — instead, the pri-
vate aspect only adds to the LP’s already solid, techni-
cal accomplishments. More importantly, the songs are 
fluid and flexible enough for us to be whichever Ingrid 
we choose: confident and stable finding “home when 
there is nowhere else to go,” as she does in the opening 
track “Home,” or vulnerable and thoughtful, as she is 
by the album’s conclusion in “Everyone Is Gonna Love 
Me Now.” But no matter the listener’s decision, that per-
sonal Ingrid will be full-fledged and may make us grow 
up in the process, too.

Constructive 
Spring: Let 
This Be My 
Reminder

Until Sunday, Feb. 23, 2014, I had 
a daily task on my phone that simply 
read: “Eat fruit.” 

It was a reminder of self-care 
that I had set a year earlier, when 
my physical results returned with 
suggestions to be healthier. I knew 
that a complete overhaul of my 
diet was impractical and next to 
impossible because of my habit of 
binge-eating anything I was handed. 
However, thanks to years of skim-
ming self-help think pieces, I also 
knew that small, incremental addi-
tions, implemented patiently over 
the course of the year, would lead to 
lifetime benefits.

So I bought fruit to fill my fridge, 
bought cross-trainers so I could sup-
plement my #yoked gym trips with 
runs and began choosing chicken 
over red meat. I could see and feel my 
health improving, and slowly, I began 
to gain (gasp!) self-esteem.

Now it’s April and I have a bowl of 
slowly rotting oranges sitting in my 
apartment. They’re from my mom 
— I have not bought more than one 
piece of fruit at a time since October. 
Today marks around seven months 
since I last wore my cross trainers, 
but they still smell like I sweated in 
them just yesterday. 

The bowl and the shoes today 
are little more than decrepit, space-
wasting reminders of the promises 
I couldn’t keep, even to myself. And 
there are more than a few reminders 
of past failures: The half-filled plan-
ners that I used because I wanted to 
be more organized. The untouched 
books that I bought to make myself 
read more. The notebook that I ear-
nestly wrote “Write Every Single 
Day” on the cover this December 
that hasn’t had a pen pressed against 
its pages in weeks. It’s not even that I 
consciously gave up on these plans. 
Life just happened.

It was more than a little heart-
wrenching to find these things, 
because they represented a better me 
that never came, a me that was never 
maintained, but the physical heart 
discomfort I felt was also probably 
the result of poor health habits. Even 
with reminders and routines in place, 
I had managed to fuck it up.

It doesn’t help that I keep high 
expectations for everything that I 
do, leaving me always crushed when 
anything, especially my goals, do not 
work out in my favor. But I tend to 
forget about the self-promises kept. 
I still try to order chicken over red 
meat when I can. I perform stand-
up comedy more often. I finished a 
pretty gnarly crossword puzzle last 
week. My accomplishments match, 
if not exceed, my failures; there is 
even proof that I continue to keep 
my promises.

Change is hard to make, or even 
see the results of, especially when the 
evidence of what went wrong is much 
more prominent. But it’s important to 
want to keep improving, to prove to 
everyone, yourself included, that you 
do want to make yourself happy. A 
friend once told me that it’s important 
to be a little selfish, because if you 
aren’t, you’ll never want anything for 
yourself and you’ll never improve.

So this spring, I’m setting a goal to 
set goals. They’ll be simple as usual: 
Apply for jobs, graduate on time, eat 
fruit, look for apartments in L.A., 
find true love, cure cancer, etc. But 
I’ll keep in the back of my mind that 
setting goals is good for me and that 
I shouldn’t be too hard on myself if it 
doesn’t work out.

But I should probably throw those 
rotting oranges away. They are getting 
pretty dank.

TACO TUESDAY TUSSLE

Fat Fish is the place to go to meet up with friends from 
UCSD, but be prepared for long waits, unless you arrive 
before 7 or 8 p.m.. Though Fat Fish is less than half a 
mile away from World Famous, the chances of running 
into UCSD friends are far higher at Fat Fish. Since Fat 
Fish is such a hub for UCSD students, the noise levels 
can get pretty high, which makes the environment 
more chaotic than World Famous and hard for con-
versation. However, if you are looking for more variety, 
Fat Fish is worth the wait. They serve small $1 street 
tacos (carne asada, carnitas or chicken) and $1.50 
shrimp tacos. I ordered the shrimp tacos and found 
them to be just as good. In fact, they were very similar 
to World Famous’ tacos. Fat Fish’s tacos are compa-
rable to World Famous’, boasting a delectable combo 
of shrimp, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese and sour cream 
sauce. Fat Fish also has a Happy Hour drink special for 
$2 margaritas from 4 to 6 p.m., but the Ultimate Baja 
Margarita, priced at $7.75, was worth the few extra 
bucks. Fat Fish does not skimp out on its tequila, yet 
the drink was well mixed in a way so that the taste of 
the tequila was not overpowering. 

Taco Tuesday is somewhat of an institution in Pacific 
Beach. Lines usually form out the door with people 

waiting to score a great deal on tacos and margaritas, 
so I was surprised when I walked into World Famous 
during its renowned Taco Tuesday — we only had to 

wait about five minutes. We were seated directly by a 
window on the nice, wood-finished tables overlook-
ing the beach, which was only five steps away. The 

exterior resembles a beachfront shack but is inti-
mate, which gives the place a casual but classy vibe. 
Though space is tight inside the restaurant, the large 

windows give the restaurant more of an open feel 
during the day. And at night, the soft ambiance light-
ing creates a friendly atmosphere. The tacos offered 
are shrimp and cost a mere $1.25 (with purchase of 

an alcoholic or non-alcoholic drink). World Famous 
doesn’t skimp on the shrimp: The tacos are large and 
full of crispy shrimp with melted cheese on top. World 
Famous adds a cream sauce that goes nicely with the 

shrimp’s texture, along with fresh lettuce and salsa. 
My only complaint is that the menu lacks variety and 

there are no drink specials.

WORLD FAMOUS

Both locations for Taco Tuesday are located in the lively Pacific Beach area where you are 
bound to have a good time. When it comes down to it though, World Famous is the winner 
because of the overall dining experience and atmosphere. Although Fat Fish provides more 
variety in tacos, World Famous comes out on top with its intimate beachfront view, quality 

tacos and the less chaotic Taco Tuesday atmosphere.

L ast Sunday night, the Casbah, a gritty club on the corner of Kettner and Laurel in 
Downtown San Diego, was brought 
to life by an unassuming quintet 
from Philadelphia. Still relatively 
unknown outside of the indie-rock 
scene, The War on Drugs recently 
released their third LP, “Lost in the 
Dream.” With sweeping New Wave-

esque synthesizers adorning a solid 
Americana rock ‘n’ roll sound, the 
band evokes contemporary acts like 
Arcade Fire and Beach House, as 
well as the heartland rock of ‘80s, 
such as Bruce Springsteen and 
Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. 
Traversing the musical landscape 
while drawing inspiration from 
various genres and eras, the latest 

album has a surprisingly cohesive 
sound — it is rich and melodic. 
(The Wall of Sound movement 
comes to mind, particularly George 
Harrison’s Phil Spector-produced 
“All Things Must Pass.”) 

Opening act White Laces, from 
Virginia, played surf rock-tinged 
tunes with stuttering drums and 
touches of synthesizers as a crowd 
gathered outside the Casbah. Adam 
Granduciel, frontman of The War 
on Drugs and former Kurt Vile col-
laborator, casually chatted with his 
bandmates and fans outside, sip-
ping IPAs beneath the clear night 
sky. Although a small venue, the 
Casbah has a nice outdoor area 
with concert posters on the walls 
and lights hanging from the trees. 

The War on Drugs began their 

set with album opener “Under the 
Pressure.” While the recorded track 
is nine minutes long, the live ver-
sion worked well despite its length. 
As each minute passed, more layers 
were added to the song — piano 
chords, rhythmic drums — and the 
cohesiveness of the band became 
evident. Despite the intricate 
arrangement of the song, each 
musician expertly played their part 
while complementing each other. 
The entire show, which lasted about 
two hours, felt like an extended jam 
session. (At certain parts, drummer 
Charlie Hall was practically danc-
ing in his seat as he played.) It was 
mesmerizing to watch a group of 
musicians blend so well together — 
hence the Wall of Sound evocation.

In tandem with the lush instru-

mentals were Granduciel’s echoing 
vocals, heavy with both reverb 
and melancholy, bouncing off the 
walls of the small, crowded venue. 
In an interview with Grantland, 
Granduciel explained that he want-
ed the new album to reflect the live 
sound he had achieved while tour-
ing for the previous album, 2011’s 
“Slave Ambient.” He assembled 
“Lost in the Dream” meticulously, 
combining sounds and obsessively 
re-arranging tracks for months, as 
though he were assembling a musi-
cal puzzle. 

“I wanted to do something 
that showcased what the band had 
become without necessarily giving 
up control of the recording,” he 
clarified.

The highlight of the show was 
“Red Eyes,” the first single from 
the new album. A cathartic song, it 
bursts at the seams during the vers-
es with cascading synthesizers and 
rapid drum beats just waiting to 
explode into the chorus. However, 
the show was not all fast-paced 
energy, as the band interwove some 
of the slower tracks from the new 
album, such as “Suffering” and 
“Disappearing” into the set list.

The War on Drugs delivered a 
sound which at first seemed too 
grand for a small venue like the 
Casbah. The limit to the space they 
can sonically fill seems endless. 
It’s surprising they weren’t booked 
for Coachella or Outside Lands. 
Yet Granduciel and his compadres 
managed to create an intimacy 
amidst the musical whirlwind that 
is “Lost in the Dream.”

CONCERT   REVIEW

USED WITH PERMISSION FROM SECRETLY CANADIAN

With my one year anniversary as a vegan coming up — cheers! — 
I’ve decided to discuss going vegan 
cold turkey, so to speak. 

I’m not going to lie to you and 
tell you that it’s easy making the 
switch to a vegan diet. In fact, I’m 
not going to lie to you and tell you 
that it won’t be frustrating at times, 
even when you’ve been at it for 
almost a year. 

The truth is that you’re going 
to miss certain foods, and some 
substitutes won’t fill that sushi-sized 
hole in your heart. 

However, before you cry to 
me, “But, Teddi, cheese? Fish? 
Mayonnaise?” — don’t worry 
about it. One thing I most enjoy 
learning — sidestepping the ethical 

arguments — is how to appreciate 
food and any way of eating 
embodies that value. 

While I scan ingredients for 
milk, its derivatives or the ever-
elusive honey, I also notice all 
the chemicals I can’t pronounce 
— like the additive butylated 
hydroxyanisole found in many 
popular foods, such as cereal and 
potato chips. 

It’s pretty difficult to find truly 
“natural” food, but the first step to a 
healthier lifestyle is simply making 
sure you are aware of what it is you 
put in your body. 

While I do enjoy the occasional 
Oreo (surprise, it’s vegan!) I’ve 
come to realize that processed food 
isn’t doing my body, especially my 
skin, any good. 

Nobody can be so holy that they 
don’t indulge in junk food every 
now and then, but in making 
finding snack foods more difficult 
for myself, it helped me to snack 
healthier rather than easier. 

One silver lining to the 
“inconvenience” of not having 
anything to eat when out with 
friends is learning how to cook for 
yourself. Plus, you save money. Any 
college student can appreciate the 
abundant variety of pasta dishes 
that can be made for under 20 or 
even 10 dollars. 

Cooking for yourself allows you 
to know exactly what’s going into 
your meal while giving you a sense 
of accomplishment. 

It’s gotten a lot easier to ditch 
meat and dairy, not only by 

using specific substitutes but also 
by simply leaving them out or 
switching in other ingredients that 
do the job just as well — such as 
almond milk for milk, hummus and 
guacamole as sandwich spreads and 
applesauce or mashed bananas as 
egg replacers in baking. 

Not only that, but with all the 
literature on what’s in our food 
and how it’s being “made” — think 
chickens being fattened up with 
chemicals or genetically modified 
grain — a vegan’s relationship with 
food is more honest. 

I started veganism with the 
30 Day Vegan Challenge, and it 
began with a lot of looking up of 
ingredients and what they are. 

To be honest, I started the vegan 
challenge as a diet because I was 

treating my body — health-wise 
— unjustly, not with the ethical 
epiphany which came later. Even 
without any qualms about the 
meat and dairy industries, trying 
a vegan, vegetarian or even a 
flexitarian (which focuses on eating 
considerably less meat) challenge is 
a good direction towards a healthier 
relationship with food. 

The first step to healthier living 
is awareness of what you’re actually 
putting in your body. 

It will thank you for paying more 
attention to what you put inside of 
it even if you’re still maintaining 
an omnivorous lifestyle or have 
adapted a vegan or vegetarian diet.

(6:48.4). Both of the men’s Varsity 8 
crews also qualified for two separate 
Petite Finals. 

“They performed good against 
the others on Saturday,” UCSD men’s 
head coach Zach Johnson said. “It 
let them qualify for the finals on 
Sunday, which was impressive.”

The UCSD women proved to be 
even more impressive on Saturday 
as they qualified four boats — the 
Varsity 8 crew, the Novice 8 crew 
and two Varsity 4+ crews — for the 
Grand Final races. 

The Varsity 8 boat placed second 
with a time of 7:21.9 behind Barry 
University (7:16.4). The Triton’s 
Novice 8 placed first in their prelim 
on Saturday with a time of 7:35.1, 
ahead of Orange Coast College by 
two seconds (7:36.6). The women 
also placed first in the Varsity 4+ 
prelim at 3:59.2, trailed by a distant 
Central Oklahoma University at 
4:08.7. The second Varsity 4+ took 
seventh but still managed to qualify 
for the Grand Finals. 

The women crews faced off 
against crews from Barry, UC 
Santa Barbara, Central Oklahoma, 
Wichita State University, Orange 
Coast College, UC Davis and Royal 
Hong Kong on Sunday. 

Head Coach Colin Truex, when 
asked about the prelims on Saturday, 
said that he was “exceptionally 
pleased” with the performance of 
his team and was happy with how 
the team progressed into the finals 
on Sunday with confidence. 

On Sunday, the Triton men 
competed against crews from UC 
Davis, Orange Coast College, UC 
Berkeley, UC Irvine and University 
of San Diego. 

At the Novice 8 race in the Derek 
Guelker Memorial Cup Grand Final, 
the UCSD men’s crew was able to 
place third with a time of 6:36.75, 
behind first place UC Berkeley 

(6:13.95) and second place Orange 
Coast College (6:34.81). The third-
place finish was the highest place 
the Novice 8 crew had ever recorded 
at Crew Classic, with fourth being 
their previous best. 

Coach Johnson expressed pride 
in the Novice 8 crew’s performance. 

“It’s a very good young crew, 
and I was happy with how [they] 
performed out there,” Johnson said. 
“It is probably one of the best novice 
teams we’ve had.”

The Tritons’ first Varsity 8 crew 
placed fourth in its Petite Final, 
while the second squad finished first 
overall (6:21.32) in the secondary 
Varsity 8 Petite Final. 

The UCSD women won first place 
in the Novice 8 Grand Final event 
with a winning time of 7:57.93, 
nearly five seconds ahead of Orange 
Coast College (8:02.54). The team 
also won first place in the Varsity 
4+ Grand Final, with a winning 
time of 8:23.24, well ahead of 
second-place finisher University 
of Central Oklahoma  (8:31.87). 
The performance was the second 
straight year in which the Triton 
women have topped the Varsity 4+ 
Grand Final at the Crew Classic. 

The Varsity 8 crew finished 
seventh overall, while the 2nd 
Varsity 8 finished fourth in the 
Varsity 8 Petite Final. 

“Their win is just a testament 
to their hard work, and it shows 
how much that hard work is now 
paying off,” Truex said. “The future 
is looking really bright.”

The two UCSD squads will now 
split up for this coming weekend 
with the men traveling to compete in 
the George Washington Invitational 
on Friday and Saturday and the 
women taking part in the Covered 
Bridge Regatta held in Eugene, 
Oregon on Saturday.

Softball Tops CCAA Standings, 17–3 Record in League Play

to UCSD for a sweep of day two’s 
doubleheader. Edwards earned 
another victory as she pitched 2.2 
scoreless innings. 

On Sunday, Edwards continued her 
dominant pitching as she powered 
UCSD to its first victory of the third 
day with a 1–0 defeat over Montana 
State-Billings. Edwards earned yet 
another complete game shutout, 
allowing only three hits and striking 
out six over seven innings. 

Despite her heroics, the sophomore 
Triton was quick to deflect credit for 
her flawless play.

“I don’t think of it as me getting 
the win for the team. I think of it 
as me doing my job to the best of 
my abilities,” Edwards said. “I like 

to go into each game with the same 
attitude of just doing my best. I know 
that my team has my back, so even 
defensively they did a huge part.” 

The Tritons lone run came in the 
fourth when sophomore catcher 
Katie Saunders’s double drove Brown 
in for the score. 

In UCSD’s final contest of the 
tournament, the Tritons entered a 
shootout against Cal State East Bay 
before taking the game 8–5. The 
Pioneers started hot, hitting a grand 
slam to take an early 4–0 lead in the 
first inning. 

The Tritons were still down 5–2 
in the fifth inning when Brown 
knocked in a three-run homer to 
knot the game at five. UCSD later 
produced three runs off of three hits 
in the following inning to clinch the 

Platinum Bracket with an 8–5 victory.
Humboldt State would win 

the championship game of the 
tournament, earning the Gold 
Bracket over Sonoma State. 

Grant and Edwards were both 
named to the all-tournament 
team, with Grant finishing as the 
tournament’s batting champion. 
Grant batted a whopping .542 and 
scored seven runs, while Edwards 
went 5–0 with just a 0.46 ERA. 

The Tritons will now travel to 
play in a four-game series against 
CCAA opponent San Francisco State 
University. The series will be split 
into two doubleheaders starting on 
Friday and concluding Saturday.

Conference Control
UCSD starts strong in opening league play, going 3–0 against 
first Western Water Polo Association opponents of the season. 

The No. 13 nationally ranked UCSD wom-en’s water polo team began Western Water Polo Association play last weekend with 
a 3–0 sweep of conference opponents to put the 
Tritons in first place. The team improved to 22–
10 overall and currently leads the WWPA by two 
games, with Cal State East Bay in second.

“We needed to win every game in order to seal 
first place,” senior utility Sarah Lizotte told the 
Guardian. “We knew that going into the week-
end, and we dominated.”

The Tritons started strong in Saturday’s games 
against Sonoma State and Cal State Monterey 
Bay, scoring 30 goals in the two matches. Junior 
attacker Jolene Guiliana led the offensive effort by 
tallying a pair of hat tricks. Lizotte and sopho-
more attacker Julia Kirkland followed closely 
with five and four goals respectively.

Despite a slow first quarter by the Triton of-
fense, the squad bested 

Sonoma State 
16–6 for its 

first con-
ference 

w i n 

of the year. In the nightcap against Monterey Bay, 
UCSD pulled ahead early and maintained the 
lead through all four quarters for a 15–6 win. 

UCSD dominated rival Cal State East Bay the 
following day, holding the Pioneers to only three 
goals to the Tritons’ 10. Lizotte and Guiliana both 
found the back of the net four times in the win 
while sophomore goalie Courtney Miller made 
10 saves.

“As far as East Bay goes, it’s well known we have 
a heated rivalry,” Lizotte said. “It was good to get 
such a decisive win.”

The weekend concluded with a 13–11 win over 
University of the Pacific in Sunday’s nightcap. 
Lizotte scored another four goals in the win while 
Miller saved another 10, giving the offense room 
to work in the weekend’s closest game.

The Tritons will see WWPA in action once 
again on Friday, April 11 at 6 p.m. in a single 
game against Cal State San Bernardino played on 
home turf at the Canyonview Pool. With only a 
few weeks of play left, UCSD has its sights on the 
WWPA tournament and nationals. 

“We have another conference game coming 
up this weekend and the Harbor Cup the next,” 
Lizotte said. “Wins will get us ready for the cham-

pionship and we’ll go into nationals with con-
fidence.”

This past weekend, the UCSD 
men’s and women’s crew teams 
faced off against fierce competition 
at the 41st San Diego Crew Classic 
at Mission Bay, coming out with the 
women winning a pair of races in 
the Grand Final races and the men 
setting a team-best record.

For the two-day event, the teams 
first faced off against rival schools 
in preliminary rounds on Saturday 

and, after qualifying, were placed 
in the Grand Final races on Sunday. 
As well as participating in the 
Grand Final races, the crews also 
participated in the Petite Finals. 

The Triton men’s team qualified 
for the Novice 8 Grand Final race 
after placing second on Saturday 
with a time of 6:23.1, behind UC 
Davis (6:21.8) and ahead of the 
University of British Columbia 
(6:25.7), UCLA (6:32.4) and the 
University of Southern California 

Tritons Finish 6–1 at Tourney of  Champs UCSD Posts Solid Results 
at San Diego Crew Classic

SOFTBALL CREW

All-Tournament selections, Grant and Edwards, power UCSD to earn Platinum Bracket. 

Triton men record best ever Novice 8 finish, while 
women win two Grand Final races at Mission Bay.Coming off of a four-game sweep 

a week earlier, the No. 19 nationally 
ranked UCSD softball team extended 
its impressive play last Friday through 
Sunday, finishing 6–1 on the road 
in the Tournament of Champions 
to earn the Platinum Bracket. After 
the successful string of contests, the 
Tritons now stand at 28–7 overall 
and first overall in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association with 
a 17–3 record in conference action. 

Traveling to Turlock, California, 
UCSD kicked off the tournament 
with its first matchup against 
Chaminade University. The Tritons 
struggled early on as senior right-
hander Jennifer Manuel allowed five 
runs, three earned, within the first 
four innings. 

However, at the bottom of the 
fourth, UCSD responded with 
three runs to trim the Chaminade 
advantage to 5–3. After three 
consecutive walks, a fielding error 
broke the Tritons’ scoreless streak 
to put the game at 5–1. Senior first-
baseman Caitlin Brown followed 
with a two-run RBI single to pull 
UCSD back into contention. 

In the fifth, the Tritons rolled with 
their momentum as four hits and 
three Silversword errors drove in five 
more UCSD runs. One more run in 
the sixth inning finalized the Triton 
comeback victory at 9–5. Sophomore 
right-hander Hannah Duarte earned 
the win after pitching three scoreless 
innings in relief of Manuel. 

“We knew that we wanted take that 
first game just to get off on the right 
foot for the tournament,” Brown told 
the UCSD Guardian. “[Once] we hit 
the fourth or fifth inning, we talked 
to the team and said, ‘It’s time to 
wake up.’” 

In their second contest, the Tritons 

competed in a hard-fought loss to 
Dominican. UCSD was down early 
when Duarte walked in the opening 
run after the bases were loaded in the 
first inning. 

The Tritons continued to play from 
behind on the scoreboard, knotting 
the game at 2–2 in the sixth and 
entering the seventh and final inning 
down 5–2. UCSD nearly achieved 
another comeback with two runs in 
the final frame but fell short 5–4 with 
the tying run stranded at second. 

In their final game of the day, 
the Tritons faced No. 2 nationally 
ranked California Baptist University. 
Redshirt freshman first-baseman 
Emma Schneider opened the scoring 
with a two-run homer in the first 
inning to give UCSD the early edge. 

The Tritons scored two more 
runs in the sixth inning to secure a 

4–1 win for sophomore left-handed 
pitcher Alexis Edwards, who threw a 
complete game for the victory.

On Saturday, UCSD recorded 
two more victories during day two’s 
doubleheader. 

First facing off against Hawaii 
Pacific University, the Tritons jumped 
ahead to a 2–0 lead in the second 
inning off a single from sophomore 
outfielder Callie Grant. The Tritons 
added another run in the fourth 
before Edwards closed out the game 
with another complete game and a 
shutout with the 3–0 win. 

In the nightcap, a four-run fifth 
inning for the Notre Dame de Namur 
tied up the game at four. However, 
three Triton runs in the final two 
frames returned the advantage
