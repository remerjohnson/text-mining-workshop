By Terry Lew 
News Editor 

Former UCSD staff member Ernest Lee, 
who was tried and convicted in August of two 
counts of residential bu rglary, asked for and 
received Friday another de lay in hi sentenci ng. 

Lee, who serv d as office manager and assis-
tant to UCSD Studc.nt Po licies/Judici al Affairs 
Director Nicholas Aguilar until his August 1996 
conviction, remains in custody pending sen-
tenci ng. 

Lee cont inues to deny he committed the 
burglaries. 

" I have maintained my innocence through-
out the case from the day of the arrest to the day 
of the conviction," he sa id . HI was in such a statc 
of shock that once the conviction was read, that 
was it for me." 

However, an Diego Police Detecti ve James 
Yeatts said Lee' excuse are wearing thin . 

"Everyone is standi ng by him, but we have

STUDY: Commission 
will examine possible

.yMM ......... 
Sen/or St"" Writer 

SAN FRANCISCO Dr. 
Charles Wilson, a UCSF professor 
of neurosurgery and senior associ-
ate on medical affairs to UC Presi-
dent Richa)d Atkinson, outlined the 
goals ofthe newly-formed UC Com-
mission on' the Future of Medical 
Education at Thursday 's UC Board 
of Regents meeting. 

Wilson said the commission -
fonned in August by Atkinson to 
study issues surrounding the educa-
tion and training of medical profes-
sionals and the delivery of health 
care in California - will address 
possible changes to medical educa-
tion at all levels, 

"The commission will examine 
the four phases in medical educa-
tion: pre-professional, undergradu-
ate, graduate medical education and 
post-graduate medical education," 
Wilson said. 

Wilson indicated the commis-
sion will formulate ways to improve 

undergraduate medical education by 
"adding required courses such as 
psychology, sociology, biostatistics, 
epidemiology, microeconomics , 
computer science and informatics." 

He also said that the commission 
will discuss how medical education 
will emphasize "outpatient" care. 

Furthermore, the commission 
will seek to determine "the physi-
cian workforce needed I 0 years from 
now based on current epidemiologi-
cal and demographic predictions," 
Wilson said. 

The commission would proceed 
in its work with an eye toward the 

emerging trend of managed medi-
cal care. 

"As medical education changes 
in response to the requirements of 
the managed care c:nvironment, we 
must maintain our high academic 
standards," he said. 

"Rethinking the University of 
California's responsibility formcdi -
cal education is both timely and 
necessary," Wilson said. 

The commission will present a 
final report to the regents in May,

Massive Research 
Ship Sets Sail Again 
DRIWHO: Scientists aboard JOIDES Resolution

By Aimee Mackay 
Guardian Reporter 

The oceanographic research 
vessel JOlDES Resolution - the 
largest noating faci lity of its kind 
in the world - set orf today to 
carry UCSD's Scripps Institute of 
Oceanography (SIO) researchers. 
on a onc-to-two-monthjoumey to 
Costa Rica. -

The Resolution. 470 feet long. 
70 fcCt wide with a drilling derrick 
that towers 211 feet above the wa-
terline. is chartered 
by the Ocean Drill-
ing Program 
(ODP). SIO is a 
founding member 
orthe ODP. 

To explore the vents, scientists 
must first drill into the seals formed 
over the vents by the earth ' s crust 
that allow the water and gases 
trapped within to escape. 

The Resolution was builtin 1978 
as an oil -drilling ship, then refitted 
in 1984 to accommodate the seven-
story stack of scientific laborato-
ries. The ship is capable of drilling 
into depths of up to 27,000 feet.

The primary purpose of the 
Costa Rica expedition. led by SIO 
Geoscience Research Di vision 
Professor Miriam Kastner. is to 
explore the life and chemi stry 
around hydrothermal vents created 
hy plate tectonics, Berger added. 

SIO scienti sts were among the 
first in to observe the "hot vents" 
in the I 970s. The vents may be a 
link to discovering the nature of 
the world' s climate in prehistoric 
eras. 

Researchers also say they be-
' lieve the vents are a key to discov-
ering the mechanism by which the 
chemistry of the· ocean and the 
atmosphere is fixed. 

The program 
went international 
in 1975, with the 
addition of the 
former So vi et 
Union, theFederal 

Republic of Germany, France, Ja-
pan and the United Kingdom. 

JOlDES remained based at 
Scripps until 1983. when the Na-
tional Science Foundation - the 
program's principal funding agency 
- relocated the program to Texas 
A&M University. 

Congressman Brian Bilbray, R-
Imperial Beach, whose districl in-
cludes SIO, is working to expand 
the waters that are open to the Reso-

Bilbray said UCSD founder 
Roger Revelle encouraged him at 
their tinal meeting before Revelle' 
death to invest in continental drift

ered "good science."

The proposed Instructional Tech-

no logy Initiati ve would impose a 
mandatory $40 fee on students, be-
ginning in fall 1997. The fee would 
gradually increase to $200 per year. 

UC President Richard Atkinson 
emphasized the imponance of the 
fee. 

" I would think that the technol-
ogy fee is very imponant," Atkin on 
said. "It sends a message to the 
uni versity. the legislature and to in-
dustry that we want to continue to be 
on the CUlling edge. Our students 
w ill be di advantaged if they ' re not 
on th is cutting edge." 

Under the proposal. the univer-
si ty would - in addition to aski ng 
for matching funds from the sta te-
seek out partners in indu try to help 
fund instructional- technology pro-
grams. 

" Everybody will share in thi 
proposal ," Hershman said. 

Regent Pat Kessler, president of 
the UC Alumni Association, criti -
cized the proposal. 

,·It looks like the ' tudents are 
sharing fir t," Kess ler said. 

Student Regent Jess Bravin al 0 
cri ticized the proposal and took is-
sue wit h the uni versity charging a 
fee for technology.

said. 

Over the past two years under the 
compact, the university has avoided 
raising student fees because the leg-
islature has provided the extra funds 
necessary to " buy out" tudent fee 
increa es. 

However. Hershman indicated 
th at the uni versity would not seck 
pnmari ly to buyout the fcc in-
creases. 

" Last year we got $34 mi llion 
above the compact." he said. " We' ve 
had questions from various audi -
ences about what would happen if. 
we got about the same amounl. 
. Where would we send the money'" 
'Would we spend it all to buyout 
fees,!, I don' t believe that would be 
the proposal." 

" I th ink our proposal would be to 
buyout some of the fees but that 
we've got some other pri oriti es," he 
added. 

According to Hershillan. the uni -

Opportunity? 
Proposition 209 

Unjustly Eliminates 
Programs That Reach 

Out to Minorities 
By Alleon IchIIck .... Heather cantIeIcI 
Contributing Opinion Writers 

Proposition 209, also known as the California 
"Civil Rights" Initiative (CCRJ), does lillie to pro-
tect civi l rights and much to harm them. The initia-
tive disguises its mean-spirited allack Ainorities 
and women through the rhetoric of "color-blind-
ness." Unfortunately, this proposition is really 
aboutluming a blind eye toward discrimination. As 
the Rev. Jesse Jackson keenly observed last 
Wednesday, "No rational person wants to be blind." 

Proposition 209 seeks to dismantle affirmative-
action programs when they are still very necessary 
for achieving the genuine equality of opportunity 
guaranteed under the ~4th Amendment to the 
Con titution. 

Proponents of 209 would have you believe that 
their initiative gives everyone equal opportunities 
for admissions, employment and advancement. 
They would have you believe that aflirmative-
action policies are not needed to provide equal 
opportunity. They would have you believe that they 
want to solve the root of the problem of discrimi-
nation by helping others help themselves. 

Nevertheless, affirmative action is necessary to 
promote equality of opportunity. even though its 
critics have blasted it as "reverse discrimination." 

A study of graduate students at UCSD 
addressed this issue in 1977, finding that "the myth 
of reverse discrimination is' invalid." It concluded 
that undergraduate GPA and GRE scores did not 
;ccurately predict future academic performance at 
UCSD for either minority or non-minority stu-
dents. 

Furthermore. the study concluded that both 
marginal-admission and regular-admission minori-
ty students outperformed both marginal-admi i~n 

. and regular admission non-minority students In 
their graduate wort .at UCSD. Through this we can 
see that the countermeasures put in place by affir-

Civil Rights Initiative 
Rightly Prohibits 
State Discrimination 
By Race 
By CIIrIs Schreiber 
Editor in Chief 

It is assumed by many that the discriminatory 
"separate but equal" standards created by the 
Supreme Coun in Plessy v. Fergusson died a well-
deserved death with the desegregation of pub lic 
schools in the Browl! v. Board of Education case of 
1954. However. in circumventing the original 
intent of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
federal and stale governments and their bu reau-
cratic agents have re-instituted "separate but 
equal" standards under a new name: affirmative 
action. 

Proposition 209, commonly referred to as the 
California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI ), ai ms to 
return California law and po licy to color-blind, 
non-preferential tandards. By eliminating govern-
ment-mandated racial discriminaLion. the CCRI 
will ensure that an individual's righ: to eq~al 
opportunity is no longer trampled upon In the mIs-
guided attempt to guarantee equality or resu lt . 

Proponents of racial preferences like to argue 
that suc h programs are necessary to mitigate the 
supposed effects of the discrimination ag~~nst .cer-
tain minority groups. This is a flawed posHlon In at 
least three major ways. 

First. it is untenable morally. One simple phrase 
we teach our children embodies the wisdom that 
demonstrates the flaw in aftirmative action - two 
wrongs don ' t make a right . If it is wrong to dis-
criminate against someone for being black or 
female. it is equally wrong to discriminate againsL 
someone for being white or male. Doing the wrong 
thing for what appear to be good reasons is still 
doing the wrong thing. 

And please do not be fooled by the faclthat the 
label "affirmative action" is auached to preference 
programs. These programs are zero-sum games . 
When one person receives preferential treatment 
not avai1ablo".to another person because of the 
color of his skin, the lalter person suffers racial 
discrimination. As General Colin Powell eloquent-
ly put it in My American Journey, "Discrimination 
'for' one group means, inevitably, discrimination 
'against' another." 

Secondly, these programs serve neither 10 
reduce racial discrimination nor 10 better the· posi-
lions of the overwhelming majorily of the minori-
ty citizens they purpon 10 help. The true beneficia-
ries of lhe spoils of preference programs are 
minorities who are already financially well-off and 
well-cducated. 

An examination of the effects of affirmative-
action policies in action serves to iIIuSlllle the 
point. At UC Berkeley, the administration takes 
pride in the university's racial profile. which mir-
rors thaI of California's graduatina hiah school

SPOILS: 
Preferential policies 
hinder real success 
Continued from pale 4 
seniors. To achieve this "wonder-
ful" di versity, the administrators 
apply separate numeri cal standards 
to applicants of differing races. In 
1986. the average SAT score for 
Berkeley 's black students was 986. 
while that of Asian-American . tu-
dents was 1254 - hardly an 
insignificant di parit y. 

ow you might be thi nking that 
helping these black students get a 
foot in the door is omething that 
will benefit them .in the long run . 
However, you would be mistaken. 

At Berkeley. over 70 percent of 
black students who begin instruc-
tion as freshmen fail to graduate. 
These are student s who have 
numerical credentials that are 
above the national average and 
who are emi nently quali fied to 
allend collcge. Is il in thei r best 
interests to go to Berkeley and not 
graduate , or would they be beller 

off goi ng to another institution 
where they need no special consid-
eration to qualify for admission and 
where they would succeed and 
graduate? 

Obviously, the latter is prefer-
able. Yet "affirmative-action" pro-
grams lead to negative outcomes 
for the 70 percent who fail to grad-
uate . These students are mis-
matched with the institu tion and 
are denied the success that would 
be their at a more suitable univer. 
sity. This would hardly eem to be 
in the best interests of those whom 
the programs are supposed to bene-
iiI. 

Finally. the main premise upon 
which affirmati ve action rests is 
flawed . Proponents of racial prefer-
ences like to claim that racism in 
society i proven due to the fact 
that the racial profiles of certain 
professions and institutions do not 
exactly mirror those of society. 
However. they are confusing the 
relationship between racism and 
the racial protiles. 

They fai I to recognize the dis-
tinction between "necessary for"

for howing that there is racism. 
but it is not sufficient to prove 
racism. 

Another set of statistics that arc 
often referenced to prove inherent 
societal disc rimination are those 
howi ng disparity in' pay between 

an average white male worker and 
other workers. At (irst glance. it 
would appear as if the evidence is 
incontrovertible. However. when 
one delves slightly deeper and 
compares the wages of white males 
with others of equal educat ion and 
cxperience. the wage differential 
disappears into the realm of statisti -
cal insignificance. People who arc 
equally qua lit,ed are equally com-
pensated. 

The argument for Proposition 
209 is straightforward and simple. 
It embodies the fundamental ' rin -
ciple of "equality und'r the law" 
that is supposed 10 he guarant .ed to 
all Cttl zens by the 14th 
Amend ment. This principle has 
been ignored in recent year~ . CR I 
allempts to re-establish the princi-
ples seL forth in the Civil Rights 
Act of 1964. 

OPINION 5 

Sen. Hubert Humphrey. the 
floor leader for the 1964 legislation 
and an old-fashioned liberal. said. 
"Tit le VII 101' the Civil Right Act) 
prohibits discrimination. In effect, 
it says that race, religion and 
national origin are not to be used as 
the basis for hiring or firing . Title 
VII is designed to cncourage hiring 
on the basis of abili ty and qualifi-
cations. not race and/or religion." 

We must not tolerate the contin-
ued existence of "separate but 
equal" standards, As Justice John 
Harlan remarked in his dissenting 
opinion in the Pless\, casco which 
originally imposed the flawed 
"separate but equal" doctrine on 
our society, "Our Constitution is 
color·bli nd. and neither knows nor 
tolerate ' classes among citizens. In 
respect of civil rights, all ci til.l:ns 
are equa l before the law. The hUIll-
blest is the peer or the Illost power-
ful. The law rcgards man as man, 
and takes nCl account of his sur-
roundings or or his color when hi s 
civil rights as guaranteed by the 
supreme law of the land are 
involved."

6 OPINION 

RACISM: 
Affirmative action 
ensures equality 
Continued from paCe 4 
that white males are discriminated 
against as a class would really only 
start to be plausible if more than 50 
percent of those in power positions 
were, for instanoc, women of color. 
Even still, beneficial policies like 
allirmative action that counteract 
institutional racism for great masses 
of people should nOl be dismantled 
merely for thc sake of a few pur-
portedly discrilDinated-against indi-
viduals. 

Proposi tion 209 is suspec t 
becausc it creates a double stan-
dard. It prohibits preferences and 
sct-asides based on race, ethnicity, 
gcndcr, etc., hut it docs not prevent 
those in power from lobbying for 
the admission or employment of 
unqualified family members and 
friends. 

Ignoring the years of special 
privileges they received as mem-
bers of the white majority, propo-
nents of Proposition 209 mischarac-
teri7.e affirmtive-action programs 
and outreach efforts as "preferential 
treatment," evoking the feeling that 
those not protected under affirma-
tive action are missing out on some-
thing. However, if one looks at the 
history of affirmative action, it is 
clear that these programs are coun-
termeasures put in place to balance 
out the preferential treatment that 
Caucasian students already receive. 

At UCSD in particular, affirma-
tive-action programs like Summer 
Bridge and Upward Bound have 
brought diversity to ihe university. 
In 1980, UCSD was made up of 
20.4 percent minorities. In 1984 
this figure rose a substantial 5. I 
perccntage points. Today, UCSD's 
population includes 43.8 pereenl 
minorities. Of that, ovcr half are 
non-Filipino A ians.

Without programs like EAOP 

(Early Academic Outreach 
Program) to provide students in dis-
advantaged areas the experience 
and support they need, the current 
diversity levels would not ' be 
reached. Proposition 209 expressly 
outlaws programs like these that are 
erroneously defined "preferential 
treatment." These programs provide 
support services that more fortunate 
students in suburban sehools take 
for granted. 

Yet Proposition 209, if pas ed, 
will effectively annihilate thou-
sands of attempts to alleviate low 
academic performance and se lf-
esteem when it begins - in child-
hood. CCRJ 'will eliminate all state-
funded children's programs 
designed to assist minorities and 
girls. It wi II eliminate funding for 
tutorial and outreach programs and 
support systems for minorities.

include Girls Science Network ,

Residential burglaries are "pre-

Deputy District Attorney James

of up to six years per charge.

San Diego County 
He wa first charged on March 

14 with three counts of residential 
burglary, one count of receiving 
slolen property, and one count of 
un authorized lodging (bei ng a 
"Peeping Tom"). He plead not 
guilty to all the charges, and was 
relea ed on hi s own recognizance. 

The first burglary occurred on 
ov. 28, 1995. Lee was accused of 

enteri ng Carrie Walton and Michael 
Salinas' unit in the La PalmaApar1-
mentscomplex, where he took Sali-
nas' Nintendo set and approxi -
mately eight game cartridges. Lee 
also took Salinas' binoculars and 
both hi s and Walton 's book bags. 

The second burglary, for which 
charges were ultimately dropped, 
occurred on Jan. 18, 1996. Christin 
Eledge and Jcnnifer Davila, living in 
the Carmen Apanments complex at 
the time, were awakcned by police at 

The UCSD Guardian 

approximately 2 a.m. and told their 
apanment had been burglarized. 

The apanrncnt 's bathroom win-
dow had been opened, and the screen 
wa lyingonthegroundout~idc. The 
shampoo and other toiletries on the 
window ledge were scattered inside 
and outside the apartment. 

Salinas, whose apartment faced 
Eledge and Davila's, said he heard 
noises al approximately 2 a.m. Hc 
went to the locked security gate 
that separated the two complexes 
and saw a man attempling to elimb 
into the two women's apartment. 

Salinas chased the man, who he 
described as five feet, sevenoreighl 
inches tall . into a nearby parking 
lot before losing him. 

The third burglary occurred on 
Feb. 8, 1996. Sarah Kimmel , who 
lived by hersclfatthe La Palma com-
plex, left for the evening at approxi-
mately 7 p.m. She returned the next 
morning to lind an open window -
the screen had been ripped off, and 
the blinds tretcheddown. Kimmel's 
backpackand about 30compact discs 
were missing. 

Late Feb. 8, Kim Weiss - who 
also lived in the La Palma complex 
- walked past Kimmel's apart-
ment and heard a lock slidi ng. She 
heard the blinds rallie and saw a 
man climb out of the window. 

Weiss followed the man and 
saw him get into his cur. She laler

LEE: Ex-staff 
member is in custody 
pending sentencing 
Continued from p .. e 7 

identifi~ Lee from a police photo 
lineup. 

The charge of receiving stolen 
property stems from Yealls' sean;h 
of Lee's residence. approximately 
two miles east of the burglarized 
apartments. Yealls found a Nintendo 
set, whose serial number matched 
the number Salinas provided. as well 
as Ii ve of the games Salinas said 
were taken. Yeatts also found 24 of 
the CDs Kimmel reported missing, 
as well as six backpacks in a closet 
- none of which belonged to 
Walton, Salinas or Kimmel. 

Lee's fiancee reportedly told 
Yeatts they had purchased the 
Nintendo, games and CDs at a ga-
rage, but Lee denied it. Another of ~ 
Lee's roommates said the Nintendo 
and games had been there since he 
arrived in December 1995 . 

Lee was charged with being a 
"Peepi ng Tom" because Walton al-
leged she saw him crouched outside 
her bedroom window as she left he( 
apartment some time between Feb. 
23 and 28, 1996. Lee lived in the La 
Palma complex at the time, bUI he 
moved out a few days later. 
The Trial 

The case was transferred to Supe-
riorCourt on May 16, minusthc "Peep-
ing Tom" charge, and Lee was re-
leased after posting a $10,000 bond, 

In June, Steigerwalt requested 
the second burglary charge be 
dropped pursuant to Section 995 of 
the California Penal Code -
charges must be dropped if "the 
defendant had been committed with-
out reasonable or probable cause." 

Steigerwalt argued that there was 
insufficient evidence 10 prove Lee 
committed the second burglary, and 
Ihat the dissimilarities between the 
threccrimesoutnumberedtheircom: 
monalities. 

Koerber returned that enough evi-
dence was presented at the prelimi-
nary hcari ng, and the three burglaries 
were ~i milar enough,1O justify charg-
ing Lee with the second burglary. 

The coun heard the 3110rneys' 
argument. and granted the 1110lion 
on July II. 

Lee. ultimately facing two wunt ~ 
Qf re~idential burglary and one of re-
ceiving stolen property, began trinlon 
Aug. 13. 1996, Kocrberrequesled that 
the court allow as evidcn e a burglary 
Lee allegedly commiued in 1992 -
although Lee was identilied as the 
culprit by the victim 's neighbor. he 

wa~ nOI charged in the incident. 
Kennedy granted Koerber's re-

que t over Steigerwalt 's objections. 
and a j ury was seated that afternoon. 
The trial procceded over the next four 
days, including testimony on Lee's 
behalf by UCSD Student Legal Ser-
vice Director Tony Valladolid , 
Aguilar and Lee himself. 

The jury rece sed on Aug, 20 10 
deliberate the case and returned 
shortly with verdicts. Lee was found 
guilty of both burglaries, but not 
guilty of receiving stolcn property. 

Steigerwalt requested that the 
guilty verdicts be set aside in view of 
the not gui fly verdict in the third cou nt, 
but Kennedy denied the request. 

Lee requested to remain free on 
bond pending his sentencing, and 
Koerber requested that he be remanded 
into custody without bail. Kennedy 
heard both arguments, questioned 
Lee's mother and decided in Koerber's 
favor. Lee was returned to the George 
Bailey Detention Facility in Otay 
Mesa. where he awaits sentencing.

" 1'! Surfing doesn't get any 
better than it does in San Diego, 

and here are some tips for 
novices looking to catch a wave 

.. .. --

f you have ever been out and 
about locall y in the hal f-hour 
before dawn, you might have 

seen members of the surfing tribe 
heading out ror the waves. Even in 
the dead of wimer while most 
people are snuggled under bl ankets 
in deep 'lumber, you can see them 
moving at a brisk pace towards a 
cold and malevolent sea. 

Chances are, you've probably 
wondered what motivates them to 
do this. Or have you gone a step 
further, and thought that maybe 
surfing - a sport in which its 
practitioners religiously indulge -
might be worth checking out? 

Among the many advantages of 
being at UCSD is the proximity to 
an attractive slice of Cali fornia 
coastline. La 10lla and adjacent 
parts of San Diego County provide 
excellent places to surf, with waves 

that can accommodate a novice as 
well as cha llenge an expert. The 
following is beginner ' guide that 
offers tip for those who have 
considered giving surfing a try, but 
didn ' t know where to start. 

. Getting Started 
Be forewarned : Surfing is an 

ex tremely phys ically-demandi ng 
spurt. 

That said, if you feel that your 
swimming might need work, 
practi ce at the campu ' pools before 
hitting the beach. While there are 
varying opinions concerning the 
exact level of swimming 
profic iency a prospecti ve surfer 
should demonstrate, no sane person 
would argue agai nst the proposition 
that strong wi mming skill s are a 
prerequisi te, 

The leg rope , or "lea hes," that 
you have seen surfers use to attach 
themselves to their boards, are not a 
substitute for swimming ability. 
They eliminate the need to swim 
f requently, but not the need to 
swim. The leashes occasionally 
snap, usually at the worst possible 
time. When thi happens, your life 

depends on you being able to swim 
back to shore without assistance. 

At the minimum, you should be 
able to swim 400 yards 
con1fortably. Olympian style and 
speed are not required. In fact , a 
quotidian ide- troke can often be 
the be t surv ival strategy. 

It would also be a good idea to 
demonstrate the abi I ity to cover 25 
yards or so underwater on a single 
breath . Surfers u uall y pend most 
of their ti me on the surface, of 
course, but when the surf is large, 
it doesn' t always work out that 
way. 

Never surf or wim alone. In 
addition, CPR profi ciency is a 
valuable asset to any surfer's 
inventory, as is a cursory 
knowledge of first aid. 

Lifeguards rescue scores of 
swimmers from rip currents every 
summer in Southern California, and 
surfing is often done at times and in 
areas where there are no lifeguards. 
Rip currents are common when the 
surf is active, and can be 
astoundingly strong in conjunction

lah! Side Dish Bob and I stuffed our faces 
at Plaza Cafe to make sure we can give 
you a t horoug h review of every tasty morsel. 

Can we say Plaza RotltHJerle'? I hope so, because Plaza 
Rotftujerfe has the best selection of homestyle cookin' I've 
see.n since Bob's mom had us over for Thanksgiving dinner! 
I started my lunch with a fresh tossed green salad full of 
lovely field greens, raw bell peppers, broccoli buds, and 
sliced cucumbers, and a side of cold chicken salad. made 
from t he fresh rot isserie chicken. For t he main course, 
I had a j uicy rot isserie roasted breast of chicken, fluffy 

whipped pot atoes dripping with chicken gra~, and piping 
hot corn bread t hat I smothered in butter. Oh, shame 

on mel For dessert I tasted a tad of the yams baked 
with cinnamon, ginger, and marsh mellows, They're to 
drool over! Boy, was I bad! I even snuck in a little peach 
cobbler, in all its glory. You could almost see the glowl 
The f laky crust and hot peaches in a thick, sweet 
sauce just topped off my meall 

I think we'll have to go back tomorrow, the food 
was all so good. I recommend you join us for lunch.

WHO WON WEDNESDAY'S PREDENTIAL'DEBATE? 

I feel like people are 
ready for a change and 
they're frustrated with 
what Clinton' has done. I 
don't think Dole is going 
to make a landslide win, 
but he's going to edge 
ahead. 

Scott"'n 
Revelle Senior 

Interviews ~y Grace Jang • Photography by Mark Patterson 

Clinton is going to win. 
He's charismatic. He's a 
very smooth talker. He's a 
people person and that 's 
what people like. 

'er ... Schindler 
Roosevelt Sophomore 

The Republican plat-
form is pretty undefined. 
So, [Dole] is trying to 
bring down Clinton as 
much as possible rather 
than setting straight what 
his views really are and 
what he thinks the country 
should be doing. • 

Darrln Holencler 
Muir Senior 

When someone from 
the a~diences asked a 
question, Clinton directed 
his answer directly to them 
instead of the whole audi-
ence. Dole wasn't as per-
sonal. Clinton was getting 
that person's vote. People 
outside are going to hear 
him whether he talks to 
that person or the whole 
audience.

Dole tried to make a lot 
of low blows, but Clinton 
didn't fall for them . He did 
a good job of sticki ng to 
the issues. I'm still with 
Clinton. In the first debate, 
affirmative action or

that they are hopelessly overmatched. 
This i nOl a pleasant experience. 
Equipment 

New surfboards can cost more 
than $350. but there is a plentiful 
supply of good, used boards in this 
area, that can be purchased for a 
fraction of the cost. Check 
classified listings in the local 
papers for good deals. 

If you buy a used board. make 
certain that any "dings," or cracks 
in the fiberglass shell have been 
competently repaired. AI 0 check 
that the fiberglass is not 
delaminating, or separating from 
the foam core. 

There is an immense variety of 
boards out there. At one extreme 
are the six-foot-long, thin, narrow, 
ullra-light , high-performance 
boards ridden by professional 
surfers and other experts. It takes a 
great deal of ski II negotiate one of 
these effectively. At the other end 
of the spectrum are the nine to ten-
foot. high-volume longboards that 
can also be di ffi ult to handle, 
especially when urf conditions 
require a Herculean effort to line

board in the mid-range; probably not 
much longer than scven-and-a-half 

FEATURES t5 

feet and no less than seven feet. If you 
are built like an NFL linebacker, go 
with a slightly longer board. If you 
would be inconspicuous among 
members of the women's gymnastics 
team, a smaller board will do. It 
should be fairly wide. between 20 to 
21 inches, without an extremely 
pointy nose or narrow tail , and should 
have soft, rounded "rails,"or edges. 

Even if you plan on buying a 
used board from an individual, you 
might want to stop into everal surf 
shops and ask to be shown good 
beginner boards. Inquire about 
"eggs" and "Fun shapes" which are 
designed to be easier to ride. With 
all of the di fferent board to 
examine. you will rapidly learn the 
significance of design features such 
as single. twin, or tri -fin 
configurations. 

While in the surf shop, take a 
look at the wetsuits. Even in the 
summer, a thin, short-sleeved, 
short-leg suit can be helpful. 
During the winter, when the water 
temperature has been known to 
drop to 55 degrees and the morning 
air can be even colder, a good 
wetsuit i essential. 

A good 312 suit (3 mm of rubber 
around your core. 2 mm in the 
extremities, for nexibility - the 
suit of choice during the local 
winters) will probably cost around

$200 . There are substantial 
di fferences in the suits on the 
market. and most manufacturers 
offer them in a variety of price 
ranges. Shop around and ask the 
surf shop employees to explain the 
differences. Above all, make sure 
the suit fits properly. Too loose, and 
you' ll freeze; too tight, and you' ll 
wish it was too loose. 
Getting Wet 

You are in primo physical 
condition, have impeccable 
swimming credentials and a basic 
working knowledge of the oceanic 
conditions as they apply to surfers. 
You arrive at a mellow beach break 
with your new board under your 
arm, and the surf is a very user-
friendly two to three feet. Should 
you jump right in and get about 
learning to surf'! 

Not unless you brought along at 
least a moderately experienced 
surfel '0 help you on your maiden 
voyag-: . There is still much to learn, 
and these thi ngs arc best 
demonstrated here on the water. 

How to "wipe out," or fall off, 
the board in such a way that you 
minimize the risk of injury is 
critical. The most common injuries 
to ~ urfers are contusions , 
lat:erations and puncture wounds 
cause I by one 's own board. Among 
the II )st serious potential injuries 
are head or spinal cord damage 
t:aused by hitting the boltom in 
shallow water. Make sure your 
surfing partner addresses these 
issues. 

You also need to understand 
some basic etiquelte. The best way 
to learn this is to watch surfers 
from shore. and learn what some 
are doing right, and make note of 
what others are doing wrong. 

Your teacher can show you where 
you have to be positioned on the 
board, and how to paddle it. The 
smooth movement required to go 
from a prone position to standing on 
the board needs to be demonstrated, 
as does the technique of "duck-
diving," the an of sinking the board to 
pass beneath a "roken wave.' 

But really, he· won't be able to 
teach 'ou to surf. Like leaming to 
ride ~ )icycle, surfing is learned by 
trial I. ld error. Only by going out 
there nd learning what works will 
you II clly master the ·sklll . 

Of course, iI's more complex 
than I 'Jing a bike, because there is 
the IT lter of the waves and how to 
cater hem. There is sometimes an 
extre lely narrow window of 
oppo ' ' unity that , allows one to 
catd I wave. Try to get in too 
early, and the wave won ' t be steep 
enough and will pass you by. Too 
late, and the wave will pitch you 
into the "pit," or trough, then hreak 
on you with impressive force. 

It has been said that surting ha 
the steepest learning curve of any 
sport. That is probably not too far 
from the truth. The key is to keep a 
pos iti ve altitude, by learn by 
ob erving others and doing, and 
above all , have fun . 

EV" nfuully, it will happen. The 
first t lC you get to your feet and 
rema ,ta nding, gliding acro s thc 
sleek Ilbroken face of a wave, it 
will be like those other rare first-time 
events 10 your life: the kind you will 
never fOrgel, and you will want to 
experience time and time again. • 

Soon, you too may be among 
the tribe of surfers on those nippy 
winter mornings, walking briskly 
towards what hu suddenly become 
much more inviting sea.

twO teams have squared off for many 
hard-fought matches. But this time, 
UCSD made sure that the Panthers' 
visit to La 10lla was a brief one. 

Despite having not played on 
their own floor in quite some time, 
the Tritons dominated Chapman 
from the outset.

during the week, the Tritons were 
able to put the practice to good use 
in covering and blocking the 
Chapman offense. The normally 
tough Panthers proved to be a push-

the match in three games . 

With the two victories over the

UNLUCKY: Scoring slump continues for the Tritons, who can only muster 
one goal in a weekend loss to Division I University of San Diego Toreros 

Continued from pa •• 24 
Running on th e home 

course, thi s year's top seven 
runner all fini shed with time 
better than the fifth runner of 
la t year, giving credence to 
th e growing belief that thi s 
year' team is headed for a 
stellar season finish . 

The Tritons rose to the level of 
the opposition, running with a 
tightly packed group throughout, 
and managed to edge out Divi -
si on I rival San Diego State by 
one point. 

By Nicole V .... 
Co-Associate Sports Editor ' 

What happens when the Division 
ill men's soccer team from UCSD, 
which has lost its last two games, 
.II!:;~. ballies the Division r 

University of San Di -
ego squad? 

Trilon fans found 
oul lasl Friday night, 
seeing UCSD fall to 
the Toreros at Alcala 
_

~~~ Park,2- 1 and dropping 
their season record to 

9-5 with their thind straight loss. 
The Tritons traveled to USD car-

ryingthe burden ofa two-game losi ng 
streak after devastating losses to Ri-
chard Stockton (NJ) andTheMaster's. 

" [The Master' s loss) definate ly 
shouldn ' t ha.ve happened," sen ior 
sweeper Joel Kosakoff said. "We were 
at a letdown, and we were playing Oat. . 
Hopefully. we gOl that oul of our 
system after that game." 

The team has also been mired in a 
scoring slump. Aft~r averaging over 
four pOints per game during thei r re-
centnine-gamewinningstreak, UCSD 
has only put the ball in the goal twice 
in the last three contests. 

"It wasn' t the prettiest soccer on 
our part ," senior forward Nate 
Hetherington said. " We were just try-
ing to get in there and get a good 
result" 

playing the soccer we ~new how to 
play," fre hman defender Wes Rob-
erts said. 

UCSD opened the second half 
hoping to follow Anmstrong' s advice. 
but USD began the second half on lhe 
altack, and scored the game's first 
goal on a header redirected off a cor-
ner kick to put USD ahead, 1-0. 

The Tritons came righl back, 
however, as Hetherington and se-
nior mid fielder Jose Ocampo cOm-
bined 10 li e the score at I - I. 
Hetherington look Ocampo's pass 
and drove it down the right side, 
past a defender and buried the ball 
into the back of the net. 

Thanks to Hetherington's goal the 
Tritons were on the 
board fin ally and 
seemed 10 be oul of the 
slump. It was nOI to he , 
however, as the Toreros 
dashed any hopes that 
UCSD had with another 
goal: A USD player's 
blind anempt at goal 
sailed past a bewildered 
Charles Levinson. who 
was 'creened by the 
heavy traffic-in front of 
the goal. 

The score remai ned 
2- 1, wi th the Tritons un-
able to mount a come-
back. 

Kosakoff said. " We were trying to 
hold Ihem off and SlOp them with 
counterallacks. After Ihat last goal, 
we had to change our game plan to 
scoring, but there wasn't enough 
time." 

Helherington's goal was hi s 10th 
of the season. He leads the team in 
goals, and is tied for the lead in assists 
with senior forward Chris Fong. 
amassing five to date. Ocampo is a 
close second, wit h his lasl assist bring-
ing his season total to four, 
complimenting hi s 6 goals. 

The Trilons next contest wi II take 
place today, when UCSD takes on 
the Tigers of Occidental College at 
the Trilon Soccer Stadium at 7 p.m. 

The La Jolla fog may have 
aided the competitors, as the 
cool, moi st weather kept run-
ners from overheating. 

Many fans turned out 10 sup-
port the Tritons on thei r home 
course, and the home field ad-
vantage was definitely evident. 
As racer Wallace said, "It's al-
ways fun to have a meet at our 
place." 

The women ran an equally 
impressive race, with seven run-
ners on the tea m placing in the 
all -time top 10. The women 
ha ve elevated thei r performance 
all season and it is beginning 10 
sh was the campaign comes to 
a close. 

Maggie Dwire l ed the 
charge. paring 1:08 off her per-
sonal be t, and logging the fast -
e I time ever for a Triton on 
thi s course by 20 seconds. 
Jenny ard, prai sed as "u com-
pelitor above all her other at -
trihutes," by Triton Head Coach 
Ted Van Arsdale, came in sec-
ond. 

Additionally, seven ofthe lady 
runners fini shed ahead of the third 
all-time Triton record on the 
course, showing that this year's 
team i indeed one to be reckoned 
with. 

The team continues to show 
the guts necessary to win in eros 
country. According to Van 
Arsdale, " It 's all about pUlling 
your elf in the arena of competi-
tion and not being afraid to faiL" 
It looks a though the women have 
very lillie fear indeed as the sea-
son heads toward its climax. 

Dwire, meanwhile, credited the 
go lden perf ormanee to the rest 
and training the team took in last 
weekend following a rough meet 
at Stanford. 

The Tritons now look to the 
Conrerence Finals next weekend, 
running against a str~ng Cal Poly 
Pomona team and a very competi -
ti ve rield . From there, lhe team 
wi II sprint toward regionals and 
on to National Finals. The team's 
hopes are hi gh. According to 
Wallace, " In regionals we hope to 
pretty much clean house and move 
on 10 Nationals ." 

"At the hair, [Triton Head Coach 
Derek Armstrong] lold us to keep 

" We had a preny Lone Ranger: Nate Hetherington (left) scored 
good game plan," UCSD's lone goal in a 2-1 loss to USD.

ting 45 seconds off her best, 
while Amanda W all ace 

The way things arc goi ng, th at

In boxing. a heavyweight fight 
is a battle of two giants. each hop-
ing 10 musler enough power in one 
punch 10 knock out his opponent. 
Well, in whal is the c losest thing 
to a heavyweight fight on a occer 
field, Ihe defending NCAA Divi -
sion III Nalional Champion UCSD 
women' s sq uad battled Division 
II powerhouse Sonoma Slate on 
Saturday night. 

And al the Ii nal bell , the Tri -
tons punched harder Ihan the Cos-
sacks, pulling out a 3-2 nail-biler 
10 improve Iheir record 10 13-1 , 

garnering their seventh consecu-
tive win. 

UCSD got off the blocks in a 
hurry 10 sIan Ihe game. Just 49 
seconds into the first half, senior 
midlielderChrisla Wemmerdrove 
down the lefl sideline and played a 
ball back 10 the middleofthe field, 
placing il in po ilion for senior 
forward Ele Johnson 10 deposit Ihe 
pretty pass inlO Ihe back oflhe net 
for the early 1-0 lead. Like a 
fighter 's quick jab. Ihe Trilons 
began the conte. I by reminding 
the Cossacks whom they were 
playing against. 

But Sonoma Slate slugged rig hI 
back. AI the 8:05 
mark . Ihe Cos-
sacks ' slar forward, 
Emiria Salzmann, 
lalli ed Ihe lying 
goal wi th a greal run 
up the middle ofthc 
field and pUlling the 
ball pas I Trilon 
goalkeeper Kell y 
Pearson. 

"They made Ihe 
Final Four lasl year. 
and Iwe knewllhey 
were going to be 
strong," Triton 
Head Coach Brian 
McM anu s sa id . 
"They were very 
lough. very physi-
cal. "

next 37 minutes or so, bUI neither 
squad could come up with Ihe go-
ahead goal. keeping the score knot-
ted at I -I. 

The Cossacks showed exaclly 
why they have won six straight 
NCAC titles, including last year's 
perfecl 10-0 co nference 
record. 

UCSD opened the second 
half as the aggressor, push-
ing Ihe ball up the field and 
maintaining possession for 
the better pan of the first 10 
minutes. Wemmer continued 
her runs down the left side-
line. while freshman Janine Harispe 
followed suit on the right side of the 
field. 

Sophomore sensa tion Alison 
Hurley starled the second half at the 
forward po ilion for Ele Johnson, 
and on two different occasions won 
comer kicks by using her speed. 
Hurley 's play, along wilh 
Wemmer' s constant pressure <.Iown 
the left side provided many scoring 
opportunities for the Trilons. 

At the 55-minute mark, UCSD 
worked the ball through the middle 
of the field with some help from 
senior midficldcrs Kelly Kramerand 
Brandie Hayungs. Laurcn Johnson 
took control al that poinl, finding an 
open Toni Nunez at the lOp of the 
IS -yard box. Nunez promptly 
dribbled past a Cossack defender 
and unleashcd acurving.left- footcd 
bla t destined for the len post. But 
Sonoma State goali e Julianne Evers 

came up with the save of her life. 
deOecting the sure goal out ofbounds 
for a comer kick . 

And only five minutes later. 
Salzmann capitalized on a Triton 
defensive mishap. knocking in a 
loose ball inside the box for her 

second goal of the match, 
putting her learn ahead. 2-
I. 

"The goals that we have 
given up this year have been 
terrible goals." McManus 
said. "Nobody ' s scored a 
great goal on us this year. 
You give [Salzmann) a hot. 

she isgoing to score. We were sloppy 
twice. Wecan ' l afford to make tho e 
kind of flJi takes in regionals." 

UCSD seemed shocked, and 
lost its focus for a couple of min -
utes, trying 10 tie the game on a 
quick play. The Tritons -did not 
lose their cool. however, and Ihey 
proceeded to peck away at the 
Sonoma defense. Constant pres-
sure was applied to the Cossack 
backfield. limiting play 10 th e 
Sonoma half of the field . 

Aflcrcounllessjabs in the form 
of runs down the sidelines and 
through the middle of the field. 
UCSD finally knolled the score, 
2-2, in Ihe 75th minute of play. 
Sonoma's goal kick wa won in 
the air by junior defender Maricela 
Oceguera, and Ele Johnson con-
trolled the ball for UCSD. Ele 
dribbled past one player and found 
an open Wemmer down the left 

sideline. 
The senior midfielder from 

Fountain Valley split two defend-
ers and played another perfect ball 
to the middle of the box, where a 
streaking Lauren Johnson fol -
lowed her namesake' effort in the 
first half with a one-timer past 
Evers. 

Wiih Ihe score still tied, the 
Tritons went for Ihe knockout 
punch, and connecled in Ihe 83rd 
minute of play . UCSD won liS 
10th corner kick of the game at the 
right flag, and Lauren Johnson's 
curvi ng noater was headed inlO 
the top left corner of the goal by 
junior sweeper Betn Freeburg. 

The eventual game-wi nner was 
a replay ofUCSD's backdoor goal 
against AZll sa Pacific on Wednes-
day nigh!. Once again , Freeburg 
waited for Ihe ball to f10al over the 
crowded box before deposi ting it 
past a beleaguered ' keeper. 

" It was a very nice ball ," 
Freeburg sai d." obody was there. 
so [ just I finished itJ. We are al-
ways conrident Ihal we can corne 
back from a deficit." 

" We played pretty well, bUI I 
think we cou ld have done beller." 
Johnson said. "But we won , so [ 'm 
nOI going to complain 100 much. 
Hopefully we ' ll come out stron-
ger in the next two games." 

UCSD faces another tough op-
po.nentloday, sq uaring off against 
another Division II sq uad. Cal

That' s right , strap on your

"'The Man" doe not mix words. 
If you' re not already scared
