Wild UCSB party 
turns into riot 
By AMY SIEGEL, The Daily Nexus 

What began as a large Del Playa party Saturday night ended In a 
"street riot" when Isla Vista (l.v.) residents and visitOrs starred two 
bonfires, overturned an automobile and pelted poli ce with rocks 
and bottles as they anemtped to disperse the crowd. 

Santa Bamara County Sheriff Roy Rosa les said early Sunday 
morn ing that about 12 people had been arrested for failure to 
disperse. It is not known if any of those arrested are among the 
2,000 rugby players who visited 1. V. for the 21st Inrernauonal Santa 
Bamara Rugby Tournament held over the weekend . . 

Several police were hit by bottles and other debrIS, but none 
required hospitalization . Reports of other injuries are not yet 
available . 

A crowd estimated at 2,000 had blocked the street in front of a 
6649 Del Playa party where a band was playing, poli ce said . Police 
officers asked the band to stop playing between 10:30 and 11::00 
pm and the band members implored the swelling crowd to clear the 
streetS. 

The crowd was "bouncing cars .. . and lifting cars wah people in 
them," Rosales added. 

Police called in an unknown number of extra offi ers and twO 
police dogs to force the resisting mob to disperse . 

"We didn't have any trouble until we started cat hmg bottles, 
said Isla Vista foot patrolman Ron Hurd . 'That preceded everythmg 
else - the extra manpower, the canine units, and the [actics." 

About 30 minutes later, five sheriffs patrol cars, With sirens 
wailing and lights flashing drove down Del Playa in another attempt 
to scatter the crowd. People pelted the vehicles with bottles and 
rocks, damaging four of the cars. 

By midnight, the majority of the crowd had congregated at the 
comer of Camino del Sur and Del Playa and soon created a bonfire 
in the intersection. An eyewitness said the fire was s~ed by what 
she thought were residents of an oceanside Del Playa apartment 
who threw flares into the intersection, where trash had been spilled 
out of the dumpster. Others soon joined the instigators toss ing 
bottles, chairs from the oceanside apartments, kerosene and 
aerosol cans into the fire . 

Other eyewitnesses said members of the c ro~d hu.rled pieces of 
trees furniture , fences , bicycles and a reSident s matlbox Into the 
fire, ~ausing property damage which police estimate will tOtal "tens 
of thousands of dollars." 

The crowd started another bonfire in a trash dumpster later 
Sunday morning in front of 6645 Del Playa , Hurd said . gt. Hurd 
called the people who started the bonfire "arsonists." . 

At 12:50 Sunday morning the Santa Baroam County Ftre 
Department and sheriffs deputies responded to a report that a large 
IXlIlfi re had started in the street. 

The fire engine dispatched to the scene sustained a shattered 
wi ndshield and body damage from being hit by fiymg objects, 
Un iversity of Cali fornia Police Sgt. BiU Beans ~id . 

"They were th rowi ng rocks, bottles, everything they could get 
their hands on," Hurd said . 

Foot parral officers, aided by UC police, were unable to comrol 
the crowd and declared the fire scene an unlawful assembly. 

When ordered to disperse , the mob responded by hurling bottles 
and rocks at the police. 

People on the balcony of 6702 Del Playa also threw debris at the 
police as th ey prepared for another dispersal swe7,p , Rosal~~ said . 

"For officers' safety we had to clear that balcony, he said. There 
was another balcony across the street with lots of people on It and 
we saw no bottles being thrown , and they (the people) were left 
alone." 

"We tried to identify the agitators and go after them ," Hurd said . 
UCSB junior David Nevell , a resident of the apartment ,I,ocated o~ 

the comer of Camino del Sur, said the poltce came m full force 
and rushed into his apartment, causing several people to panic and 
three women to seek refuge from the riOt in his bedroom. 

"It was mayhem, it was crazy," he said . 
NeveU said the viole nce got "out of hand" when the poli ce 

attempted to make a sweep of Del Playa and charged the crowd in 
helmetS and riot gear. 

"I saw girls screaming in terror and runni ng away," hesaid . NeveU 
guessed that the riot escalated into a violent confrontation because 
"as soon as a crowd gathers, everyone becomes anonymous - no 
one would act that way on their own." 

"How would I describe it? Drunkenness, anonymity, darkness," 
Hurd said ."It was a street rIOt. 

"The alcohol level was up and it wasjust an unruly crowd ," Rosales 
said . "With the personal attacks in Palm Springs , that was in the 
back of my mind .... [ wasn't goi ng to let that happen .

Protocol for peace mingles 
with the real Nicaragua 
By MARIKO TAKAYASU, Capitol Correspondent 

MANAGUA, Nicaragua UCW -
- The University of California 
"Prorocol for Peace" delegation 
spent nea rly two weeks traveling 
throughout the country, 
interviewing dozens of people 
from aU walks of li fe and seeing 
firs t hand , the problems 
Nicaraguans are faced with. 

The members of the 
delega tion, made up of six 
student delegates, two fac ulty 
members and 13 observers, came 
here to gather info rmation about 
the country , th rough meeting 
with people from aU sectors of 
Nicaraguan society. 

Later this month, the student 
delegates will meet wi th fOllr 
Nicaragua n students and 
negotiate a peace proposal, in 
petition form , which will be sent 
to universi ties across the country. 
The fina l declaration will then be 
se nt to both the US Congress 
and the Nicaraguan government 
as a gesture towards peace. 

The delegation's daily schedule 
was crammed with interviews set 
up by the U.S. State Department 
and the Nicaraguan government, 
which included officials from the 
Sandinista government and the 
U.S. Embassy, opposi tion groups, 
business, religious, and human 
rights organiza tions, unive rsity 
students, peasants, children, 
soldiers, journalists and teachers. 

The delegation also had some 
time to wander through the 
streets and meet with ordi nary 
citizens. 

Here are some impressions of 
the trip from members of the 
delegation. 

JACQUE UNE ROSS , delegate , 
UC Davis: 

"After talki ng with people from 
bot h sides, what I got out of that 
is the majority of the people 
would much rather have the 
Sandi nistas in charge than have 
the cont ras in charge. (The 
contras are the rebel forces 
fighting agains t the Sandinista 
govern ment. The Reagan 
Administation suppOrts the 
co ntra s, whose chief objective is 
ro overthrow the andinista 
government.) 

'The people might not agree 
with evelything the Sandinistas 
say or do, but they see the 
Sandinista alternative as the 
better option at this time. 

"We heard from those who 
object to the Sandinistas, the 
reasons why they oppose the 
present government and [ 
imagine that some of that is 
valid. (The government has 
imposed a ·state of emergency," 
which includes censorship of the 
press and interrogation of those 
suspected of collaborating with 
the cont ras.) 

"But, the U.S. should give, 
Nicaragua' a chance to develop 
on its own and even if we do 
object, it's not our right to kill 
the people of a newly formed 
country." (Immediately following 
the overthrow of the Somoza 
regime, the Reagan 
Adm inistration began waging a 
war against the newly formed 
Sandinista govern ment by aiding 
the cont ras , whose chief 
objective is to overthrow the 
gove rnment.) 

Human Rights: "I'm a little 
ambiguous on this issue. 
Certainly, the U.s. has no bas is 
to point its finger at Nicaragua 
on this issue . Our government is 
very guilty of committing human 
rightS violations. The Sandinistas 
admit they committed a wrong 
with the Miskito Indians, but 
they're willing to address it and 
have done much in the way of 
compensation." (T he Sand inista 
government forced the removal 
of the Miskito IndIans from their 
homeland in onheastern 
Nicaragua, located near the 
border to Honduras where contra 
activity has steadily increased 
since 1982. The Miskitos have 
been moved inland where the 
government says they will be 
more safe. However, several 
hundred Miskitos, dissatisfied 
with the government , have

Honduras.) 

U.S. Reputation: "The 
reputation we 're getting, 
co mpounded with the Grenada 
Incidcnt, IS humng us 
InternationaUy. I think our 
government's wrong in trying to 
co mrol the people in the world . 
The u.s. has ceased to be a 
government of th e people." (In 
October of 1983, the us 
invaded Grenada, a move 
designed to rid the small , island 
country of Cuban influence and 
restore American credibility 
throughout the Caribbean Basin. 
The removal of the Cuban 
presence was seen as a victory 
by the Reagan Administration , 
because it eliminated 
CommunistS from the island.)

"One thing I was impressed by 
wa the matunty of everyone wc 
dealt with . I mean, the people we

Unravelling AS Council politics 
In the face of the deanh of experienced and well-intentioned candidates in 

this year's AS election , we at the Guarqfan have struggled to come up with 
individuals who we think will best cany out the will of the students on this 
campus. Unfortunately, our discussions have left us knowing that there are few, 
if any. able candidates aiming to create better student government . Most of 
those who are experienced and well informed have been groomed too well in 
the prevailing AS procedure: they understand the workings of the current 
administration , but they lack a cogent and honorable vision of the future . And . 
although the inexperienced candidates often have noble intentions, they lack 
competence in both executive procedure and innovative planning. 

Those who we have chosen to endorse (and there are only a few) represent 
who we feel are the best candidates for the offices they seek. But, in th e future , 
we urge aU of you who seek to lead the students of this campus through fair 
and organized government to take the initiative and risk to campaign for 
support. 

For the position of President o f the Associated Students the Guardian urges 
you to vote for candidate John Riley. Of aU those running for the office , Riley is 
the most experienced of the least-biased candidates. He has participated in 
many AS committees and has been Warren Senior Senator this year. In the 
past, Riley has shown integrity in his decisions even when pressured by other 
'representatives to change his mind . He also makes consistent efforts to 
represent aU of his constituents. Although Riley already associates himself with 
a group which demands his attention and loyalty (Tau Kappa Epsilon 
fraternity) , we hope that he will best be able to institute policies which attend 
to the wants and needs of the majority of the students of this university. We 
hope that Riley will effectively fulfill the will of the whole student body rather 
than simply implementing the ideals that his fraternity upholds. Riley has the 
potential to be an effective leader; nevenheless, we worry about the latent 

attachments he holds. 
Carlotta Ponds of the SUDS slate is, in our opinion , the best candidate for 

the position of Vice President Administrative . Ponds has had a great deal of 
contact with the student body at large , and she supports diverse backgrounds. 
She has received good training in leadership through her experiences with 
Warren College student government. BSU and OASIS. And her involvement 
with culturally diverse groups on campus gives her the insight to offer 
contrasting and constructive poliCies. 

The Guardian recommends Pam West from the SUDS slate for the position 
of Vice President Financial. West has been the Activities Commissioner for BSU 
this year and has been involved in many campuswide activities. She can best 
represent diverse student opinion in her budgeting policies as vice president 
financial because she does not adhere to mainstream thinking. 

Joel Schachne is by far the best candidate for Commissioner of Programming. 
He is creative consultant to the Triton Pub , he has organized all of the 
noontime concerts and he is a musician. Through these activities he has 
obtained both the experience and the contacts necessary to be a successful 
Commissioner of Programming. 

For the position of Academic Affairs Commissioner the Guardian endorses 
Michelle Hopkins. Hopkins has had extensive experience on the commission 
and with the commission's related boards and organizations. She has worked 
with the Faculty/ Student Relations committee and she is the student 
representative to the Academic Senate. She has both the information and skills 
to make an effective Commissioner of Academic Affairs. 

Whatever decisions you make about the quality of the candid~~~s for office 
in the AS Council, the Guardian urges you to voice them in the election this 
Wednesday.

Financial questions 

Editor: 
I write in concern for the AS 

elections and the undergraduates 
the elected officials will 
represem. As Vice President of 
Finance thiS past year and 
Activity Fee Commissioner for 
1984-85. I believe I have an 
understanding of the AS 
finanCially that the general 
student does nor. It 1S Wlth thiS 
understandmg that I strongly 
support the following candidates. 

I believe I'mhout a doubt that 
Greg McCambndge is the best 
qualified for president. Although 
John Rile y has been an excellent 
senator, J have found him to be 
easily influenced by pressure and 
wishy-washy in hlS voting. Greg 
will make a strong president who 

will look out for all students' 
concerns, not just the more vocal 
student groups. 

For vice president Finance I 
support Ira Rubenstein. Ira has 
consistently made an effort to 
learn abom the posmon he IS 
runnmg for and has spent much 
time With me and the Student 
Organization Finance Board. 
Although Pam West has been an 
asset to BSU and qUite qualified 
in the ways of finance . I have 
twO major concems. Firsdy, her 
affiliations With specific 
organlZallOnS will make it 
difficult to be unbiased as thiS 
position requires Secondly. she 
has made no effort whatsoevcr to 
learn about the Job of V P. 
Finance. She has not been to 
any meetings nor spoken to me 
about the poslllon . Clearly, Ira IS 
the better choice. 

I also u!'ge voters to elect Joel

Editor: 

Over the past twO years I have 
served this campus as both 
Student Body Presidents Council 
Representative and as AS 
External Vice President! AS 
External Affairs is a very complex 
world dealing with rea l-life issues 
that affect all UCSD students. We 
deal with things like student 

fees, affirmative action, financial 
aid , divestment, community 
relations, women's issues and are 
responsible for representing and 
lobbying for you to the UC 
Student Body. Board of Regents, 
President Gard ner's office, 
Chancellor's Office. San Diego 
Community and State Legislature. 

The activity generated by As 
External Affai rs depends on the 
part of the AS President. This is 
why electing an AS President 
committed to such issues is so 
imponant. Greg McCambridge 
has worked actively and 
Impressively on a wide variety of 
these real life issues. During hi5 
involvement with AS External 
Affairs . he has shown the 
commitment and knowledge to 
lobby effectively for student 
rights . McCambridge has the

LA JOLLA 
ANGER, IT IS SAID, is an incorrigible way of soothing a desperate ego. 
Frustration , I will add is rarely 
handled with proper care; 
frequently, we allow our cups to 
runneth over a precipice so 
steep that we rapidly discover 
ourselves reacting blindly' to 
someone's critical suggestions. 
Why is it . a friend asked me 
recently, that supposed friends 
act so violently to each other 
during times of political crisis? Is 
it the overwhelming lust for 
power and/ or recogni tion that 
dupes our sensibilities? Or can it 
be that participants in th~ 
electoral game frequently hide 
from truths . even when posed by 
friends , when they are 
confronted with them? 

No person owns the patent on 
truth , neither journalists nor 

politicians can claim this scepter. 
but both parties a re commonly 
guilty of espousing this 
impressive asset. Last week , 
before A.S. elections, I, along 
with some of my more ambitious 
peers. attempted to hold that 
scepter and command public 
conscience over who was best 
suited to lead student 
government. Although 
formulating legitimate opinions 
for your judgement is part of my 
job, in that case. I mav have 
gone too far in depicting the 
negative qualities of the 
presidential candidates. For all 
the candidate s did have their 
positive qualities (such as their 
desire to serve the public), bur it 
has always been an assumption 
of mine that when the stakes arc 

.at their highest for the 
community-at-Iarge one is

obligated to be as honest as he 
can. So regard less of the good, 
working relationships th at I had 
(and hopduUy will continue to 
have) with the candi dates who 
ran for office. I made a deciSIOn 
to relate my political experi ences 
with these people to the student 
body. A few of these candidates 
were hurt by what I wrote . most 
likely feeling that I breached 
some form of an abstract, mutual 
trust. I must say to them, and to 
you, though, that given the harsh 
realities of our world , and the 
dire situation we are in at UCSD 
concerning student rights, that 
politics can no longer be seen as 
a game between chums. That is 
why when I discussed the crisis 
in student leadership I chose 
to analyze the candidates 
in relation to that dilemma. and 
not in relation to myself. 
Although some may feel I was a 
little unfair in my exposes, I 
believe J gave everyone a great 
deal of consideration before 
making my criticisms. Let us go 
on to create the future together, 
not in a divisive manner.

The most appalling occurance 
of this year's elections came 
about when possibly up to 10 
percent of the electorate was 
declared ineligible to vote as 
their payment of registration fees 
had yet to clear the computers. 
In some instances. voters who 
had paid their fees a week 
beforehand were told that thei r 
names did not appear among 
registered students, and therefore 
could not vote. We are all aware 
of the probability that the 
majority of students who do not 
enroll for spri ng quaner during 
wi nter are mostly financial aid , 
and low income students. It is 
this constituency that created the 
SUDS slate; now [hat they are

The 25 pc rcent of the electorate 
that did vote last week showed an 
attraction for indepe nd e nt 
cand idates - most notably John 
Riley - and an aversion for 
blanket vOti ng on slates. With the 
exception of the Rile y vs. 
McCambridge presidential race, 
though , this time around the 
choice is factua lly between SUDS 
and POTLUCK candidates. Mr. 
Riley said that he feels more ~ 
comlonable working with SUDS 
people , and vice-versa, so if 
you are looking lor diverse ,

Regents approve new 
University Center designs 
By EllEN CAPRIO 

DESIGNS FOR the $18.6 million University Center/ Bookstore, to be 
located southeast of the Central 
Library near the police station , 
were approved by the University 
of California Board of Regents 
March 21, Tommy Tucker, 
assistant vice chancellor of 
undergraduate affairs said. 

"It's a dream come true for us . 
It is unique . We think it's going 
to be the finest non-classroom 
facility on any campus in the 
country," Tucker said. 
. When completed, the 

University Center, consisting of 
two major buildings, one with 
three levels and another with 
two, promises to be "the focal 
point for campus activity," 
according to UCSD Chancellor 
Richard Atkinson. 

"The students and parents 
whp have so generously 
supported the center thus far will 
surely be pleased with this 
splendid design ," Atkinson said . 

The center, due to open in the 
fall of 1988, includes a theatre 
with seating for Spa which will 
serve as a classroom during the 
day, a multi-purpose room with 
adjacent kitchen and lounge 
holding ur to 2000 people, a 
three-leve bookstore, 14 meeting 
rooms, various student 
organizations, AS. and staff 
offices, nine restaurants, three 
major lounges and a recreation 
center with a darkroom, Tucker 
said. 

Outdoor areas include a plaza,' 
which can accomodate up to 
1200, a triangular green area and 
a water feature , which would 
permit students to walk over the 
water on cement steps, and 
outdoor seating connected to an 
indoor pub by glass doors, 
allowing 150 to eat outside, 
Tucker added. 

The bookstore will be about 
twice the size of the current one, 
allowing increased tide selections 
and a computer section three 
times larger than the area in the 
present store, said Paul Mares, 
UCSD Bookstore director. 

"We want to increase 
academic titles, not found in 
commercial bookstores: Mares 
said. 

The ground floor, which will 
open into the Central library 
quad , will include medical, 
technical and general books, 
giftware and the Sunshine Store, 
which will have a separate 
entrance, allowing it to remain 
open for more hours than the 
bookstore. 

The second floor will contain 
all course books , computer sales 
and school, art and engineering 
supplies that will be "more 
directly related to courses," Mares 
said. 

The tor floor will consist 
m.ai~y 0 administrative offices 
and a sign-making facility 
designed for bookstOre use, he 
added. 

Price of books arl! not 

. expected to rise to fund 
increases in stock. Mares said . 

"The arc hitects were ve ry 
helpful. It ( the center) is a 
beautiful, outstanding complex 
... able to pretty muc h sa tisfy 
everyone's needs: ' he added . 

Despite the size of the new 
bookstore , Mares said it will be 
"bursti ng at the seams again" in 
one or twO years . 

"We know there will be some 
growth area. Our goal was to 
define the most flexible space we 
could design ... (with) movable 
fiXlure walls able to expand or 
reduce (sales) areas," Mares said . 

Funding for the University 
Center came from five major 
sources: Registration Fee 
Reserves ($ 1 miDion), Campus 
(Chancellor) Diseretion\lry Funds 
($1 million), 25th Anniversary 
Fund-RaiSing Campaign ($2 
million), Revenue (student fee 
increase) Bonds ($9.15 million) 
and the Bookstore ($5.5 million). 

Students voted in May 1984 to 
help fund the UniverSity Center 
by accepting a $25 per-quarter 
increase in fees . The increase, 
beginning after groundbreaking, 
expected in the summer, wiD 
account for the major proportion 
of the total revenue. 

"Institutions 01 higher 
education recognize that campus 
environments have a major 
impact on the total educational 
experience. Students do indeed 

• learn from each other and from 
faculty and staff in informal 
association outside the 
classroom ," Tucker said . 

About 20,000 people per day 
are expected to use the center 
and about 6,000 events will be 
held during its first year of 
operation, Tucker estimated. ~

Lobby investigates 
Gramm-Rudman 
By EllEN CAPRIO, Staff Writer 

MEMBERS OF the UC Student Lobby support a senate budget committee proposal requiring a $20 billion tax increase and redUCing administrative costs to banks in 
order to combat President Reagan's proposed cut (for fiscal year 
1987) of $54 million to UC schools in student financial aid, forcing 
almost half the current UC loan recipients to seek aid elsewhere , 
one member said. 

"The UC Student Lobby is., for the most part, in support of a 
revenue increase because there's just so few things to Cut that the 
only real way out, to prevent aU financial aid from being cut, is to 
have a revenue increase," Eric Weiss, directOr of the UC Student 
Lobby, said . "It ( the proposal) is the best thing for education at this 
point ," he added . 

The cuts proposed by Reagan are part of the Gramm-Rudman 
Balanced Bud2et Act. oassed last fall bv Conl!ress. to force a 
balanced budget by 1991. About 70,000 of UCs apprOXimately 
140,000 students receive financial aid, according to a recent article 
in the Daily Nexus of UC Santa Barbara. One third of these students 
would be disqualified by the proposed budget for fiscal year '87 
eliminating families that earn over $24,000 a year from grant 
eligibility, the article said . . 

"The bestwe could hope for is a freeze - in all spending, as far as 
financial aid, grants and loan payments," Weiss said. "What we 're 
doing is initiating letter writing campaigns - to get something like 
the senate bill passed , possibly a freeze - and to remind them 
(congressmen) how important education is," he added. 

"Our caucus alone has generated over 1000 signatures," Weiss 
said about a recent Associated Students petition, asking Congress 
to distribute Gramm-Rudman cuts more evenly. 

Weiss called Secretary of Education, William Bennett's statement 
that students were using government aid to go on vacations, untrue . 
"The payback of federal loans is being enforced now. Over the past 
five years, there 's been a severe crackdown on that That's the only 
real way you can justify the increase in loans ," Weiss said . 

"Gramm-Rudman cuts are Sort of a steamroller effect and I reatly 
don't think that when legislatOrs make these drastic cutS, that 
they're really recognizing the true value of education," Weiss 
sa~ . ~

opposition panics such as PU,

they were harrassed by the 
government. which caused some

election,

what he characterized as 
requirements for authentic 
elections. including the 
separation of the Sandinista 
party from the state, repeal of 
cenain laws providing for 
nationalization of private 
property, and direct negotiations 
berween the Sandi nista 
government and the contras, 
Cruz announced that the 
elections were "totally ridiculous 
and illegitimate ", a farce," 
However. the Sandinista 
government invited many 
international organizations, 
including LASA (the Latin 
Ameriqn Studies Association) 
and human rights groups to 
observe the electoral campaign 
and the general election . and 
conclusions were similar - that

Continued from page 9 
government with lour peace 
proposals in hopes of reaching 
an agreement to end the civi l 
war and to recognize Nicaragua's 
right to self-detennination and 
independence. 

The treaties are part of the 
peace-making process begun by 
the Contadora countries of 
Mexico, Panama, Venezuela and 
Colombia in earlr 1983. The 
chief objective 0 the Contadora 
process is to resolve, through 
diplomacy, the current conflicts 
in Central America. 

According to the Contadora 
Group, the proposals reP.resent 
significant concessions by 
Nicaragua and address several 
concerns raised by the Reagan 
Administration. The Contadora 
peace proposal consists of: 
.The withdrawal of foreign 
military and security advisers 
and the elimination to aU foreign 
bases in Central America. 
Currently, the United States has 
about SO-IOO military advisers in 
Honduras, where the contra 
rebels are located. There are 
about 800-1,000 Cuban advisersa 
in Nicaragua . 
. A non-aggression agreement 
between Honduras and 
Nicaragua. The fighting between 
the Sandinistas and the contras 
is occurring mainly along the 
Honduran -Nicaraguan border. 
.A ban on aU outside support 
for guerilla forces fighting the 
governments of other Central 
American countries. President 
Reagan contends that Nicaragua 
has been supplying arms to the 
EI Salvadoran guerillas, a charge 
that has never been proven . 
.Respect for the Central 
American people's right to self-
detenninarion and non-
interference in their internal 
affai rs, which is a provision in 
the charte r of the United 
Nations. 
. A halt 10 trade embargos and 
effons to bloc k foreign economic 
assistance agains t a ny Central 
American country. Last year, the 
United States imposed a trade 
embargo against Nicaragua. 

Other countries in the 
hemisphere , including Brazil, 
Argentina, Peru and Uraguay 
support the Contadora process 
and have asked the U.S. 
government to give the 
diplomatic efforts a chance to 
bear fruit. 

The Sandinista !eadership says 
that the Reagan Administration 
has nOt given the Contadora 
process much of a chance to 
succeed . Instead, they say that 
the United Sta tes and Honduras, 
through the C.lA, have chosen a 
military solution aimed at 
ovenhrowi ng their government 
and its revolution . In 1979, the 
Sandinistas overthrew th e U.S.-
backed dictatorship of Anastacio 
Somoza, whose family for 50 
years killed , tonured and 
repressed the people of 
Nicaragua. 

"Reagan is creating the 
conditions for military 
intervention in Nicaragua," said 
Dr. Paul Oquist, chief adviser 10 
President Daniel Onega. "The 
C IA and the admin istration 
have pur in place th e 
infrastruc tu re [or direct 
interve ntion. In Hondura s, you 
have the 17 airStrifs, you have 
the warehouses ful of mili tary 
weapons and now all you have 
10 do is bring in the troops," 
OqulSt said . 

President Reagan says the 
Sandini tas' growing military 
strength , it support for 
Salvadoran rebels, its increased 
dependence on Cuba and East

Europe and for its growing 
internal repression are a menace 
to aU the country of Central 
America and a threat to the 
national securiry of the United 
Sta tes. 

Further contra aid is needed , 
Reagan says, to pressure the 
Sandi ni stas to c hange its ways 
and move to more democratic 
processes. 

The Sandinistas say that U.S. 
presence in Honduras and direct 
support for the contras has given 
the Sandi nistas no other choice 

but to militarize th e country . 
The Sandinista government 

says the state 01 emergency which 
restricted cenain freedoms was 
ina response !O a very real 
c riSIS, cons isting of attacks from 
contras, internal sabotage and 
economic destabilization. 
Nicaragua affirms that once 
contra aid is halted and a treaty 
is signed , it will end the sta te of 
emergency and grant the contras 
amnesty with full political rights. 

' We are willing to discuss 
!egitimate security concerns the 
United States has, but. .. within 
a framework of mutual respect: 
Bendana said . The Reagan 
Administration walked OUt of 
negotiations with the Nicaraguan 
officials last year. "It wasn't really 

rMRS NEEDS 
WOMEN 

a negoliatl On ," Bcndana said . 
"The United Sta tes came in and 
said these arc our terms, take It 
or leave it. 

"We thought negotiations 
presume a willingness, that both 
panies have legitimate interests 
and are going to n)' to work out, 
through a process of give and 
take , some sort of understanding, 
in an effon to iron out 
differences," he added. 

In January and agai n last 
month , the countries involved in 
the Contadora effon urged the 
United States to resume dialogue 
with Manague. Five more 
countries, including EI Salvador, 
endorsed such a dialogue . 

According to Benedana and 
other government officials, the 

United Sta tes has only paid lip 
service to Contadoro proposals 
and the group's effons 10 
promote negotiarions between 
the nations of the region. 

"Reagan's actions seem to 
undercut the actua l negotiating 
process." Bendana said . 
Nicaragua is just as concerned 
and feels just as threatened by 
U.S. advisers and troops in 
Central America and "we're 
willing to put every foreign 
adviser that's in our country on a 
boat tomorrow as part of this 
regional package ," Bendana said , 
"It would be tragic if the 
president'S belligerence 
obstructed this process." 

The SandiniSlas are willing to 
be ilexibile during the 

negotiations, but "we 're not gOlllg 
to be stupid ," Bendana said , 
"We're not going to do it (make 
concessions) unilaterally." In a 
telephone interview, Johnson , 
legislative aide 10 Rep. David 
Dreir, R-Los Angeles said that 
"the Reagan Administration 
would like to use the Contadora 
process as a framework for a 
negotiated settlement." Johnson 
said , "Nicaragua has refused our 
request for a framework for 
bilateral talks because they are 
trying 10 reach a settlement 
exclusively with the Contadoras." 

If the United States agreed to 
the Contadora proposals, · U.S. 
influence would be removed 
from the area," he said . ~

A lathety look at daytime dramas 
By WENDY STERN 

I HAVE OFTE wondered why, for what tangible reason, I walCh soap operas, They're 
garbage. No , they're worse than 
garbage. So why have I raced 
home from school everday for 
three years to watch them? And 
why was I the first to learn how 
to set the timer on our new 
VCR? Why did I want, or rather 
need to walCh these soaps 
everyday? Because I am easily 
convinced of the character's 
melodramatic lives, and besides, 
what else is there to do in MOM 
from the . hour of twO to three in 
the afternoons? 

Every person, at one time or 
another, has come in contact 
with a soap opera. No matter 
how hard they try to deny 
watching them, I'm sure that at 
least half the population of 
students at UCSD know who 
Luke and Laura were, (even 
though they're now living in the 
Andes mountains in southern 
Chile.) Perhaps people watch 
because they have the comfort of 
knowing that they can tum on 
the tube a few months, or 
perhaps even years later and 
know nothing much has 
changed. Unfortunately, there are 
few soaps that you can do this 
with. 

"Young and the Restless," for 
example has not changed in 
months. Nikki and Victor are still 
married even though they hate 
each other, and Nikki still has 
not found a conditioner strong 
enough to relax her 
unmanageable mane of straw-like 
hair. For the past few months, 
smce Christmas, they have both 
cheated on one another yet they 
refuse to get divorced, "for 
Victoria's sake ." (She's their 
young daughter.) You think it's 
easy on the kid to hear 
blasphemous statements about 
their mother's and father'S lovers 
as a bedtime story? The kid is 
destined to be a basketcase 
anyway. Let's JUSt hope it's 
WIthout her mother's hair. 

"One Life to Live ," on the 
other hand , must be viewed very 
closely every day in order to get 
the full story of ikki Smith and 
Vicki Buchanan . Although I have 
watched this show faithfully for 
three months to answer this 
question, I'm still sort of 
confused. Is Nikki Vicki , or 
what? And JUSt what is the 
purpose of Nikki Smith's 
character in the first place? At 
first [ thought it had to do with 
Tina's ploy to get Landfair, but 
now that Vicki is Vicki again, I'm 
back to square one. One thing 

that will probably never change 
on "One Life to Live" is Tina's 
eye makeup - you can always 
count on four pounds of black 
eyeliner. 

Besides the plots of soap 
operas, the conversations are 
another puzzler. Is it possible for 
two diITerents sets of people to 
have the exact same 
conversation? The answer is yes, 
with no problem at all. Picture 
this: the [wo sets of people are at 
the local town hangout (for 
"General Hospital" it's either the 
Roating Rib or Kelly's; and for 
"Days of Our Lives" it's either 
Shenanigan's or Blondie's), Pete 
and Melissa and Kevin and Terri 
are facing each other while the 
background music (violins, of 
course) plays quietly behind their 
voices. Pete looks mto Melissa's 
eyes while Kevin does the same. 
(For Kevin and Terri , they are in 
the pnson's visiting room.) 

"I've missed you," Kevin and 
Pete both say seductively. (Let it 
be known that they have only 
been an hour without their 
respective women .) 

"I've missed you, too ." The 
women reply, batting their 
eyelashes a few times. 

The violins get louder and 
louder, seeming as if there is 
actually a point to the 
conversation. 

·Where would I be without 
you?" Pete and Kevin say, With 
desperation in their throats. 

"The same place I'd be -
dead. Together we can make our 
love the only thing that WIll ever 
matter." The lovestruck girls clasp

their man's hands even tighter, 
while simultaneously leaning 
their heads closer together. 
(What if they just had an onion 
pizza for lunch?) 

.... Mmmmm ... You 
promise?" The boys ask, 
desperation still in their voices. 

"I promise. I'd rather die." 
And this is where the ever 

popular "soap opera kiss" comes 
in . You know, the one that stans 
out slow and eventually fades au( 

into a detergent commercial? 
These SOrts of kisses can be 
done anywhere from satin 
decorated boudoirs to the hide-
out tent in the middle of the 
jungle. The characters can be 
either perfumed and perfectly 
groomed or unshowered and 
contaminated with germs; it 
doesn 't matter, to soap people, 
lips are lips. 

Which brings us to wardrobe 
and makeup, my favorite pan. 

Ever wonder how Erika Kane has 
the same amount of makeup on 
when she wakes up as she did 
when she went to sleep? Or why 
Tina Lord wears a backless 
sequined dress to meet Richard 
Abbott for a drink at the Vernon 
Inn at three in the afte rnoon? 
Well how else are these women 
supposed to get their respective 
jobs done? Imagine Erika Kane 
trying to seduce someone with 
rollers in her hair and no 
makeup on. What's she 
supposed to say when one of her 
rollers hits the guy in the face? 
"Oh, I'm sorry, are you okay? 
And what about Tina Lord? How 
will anyone know who she is if 
she doesn't stand out in a 
crowd? 

That is the definition of what 
a soap opera woman is, a person 
who wears so much makeup and 
elaborate clothes that even if 
(and this is a big iO the woman 
was unattractive or had the 
slightest imperfection in their 
appearance, you wouldn't be able 
to tell without a television screen 
the size of [WO football fields. 
The men, on the other hand , 
have a much more believable 
and natural appearance. They 
wear slacks and ties, and even if 
they did look a bit out of the 
ordinary, you wouldn't be able to 
tell because 98 percent wear 
doctor's (hosoita\) coats. .

I KNEW THERE were three of them, maybe more, only a few feet away. I saw them as my 
sweaty, dusty, adrenaline·addled 
body became one with the 
bottom of ~he trench. My first 
trench at that, and my 
unfamiliarity with the situation 
was adding exponentially to my 
fears and utter ignorance 
concerning what the hell J was 
supposed to do next. I had 
achieved my first goal, securing 
the trench for the other five 
anonymous faces in my fire 
team. 

Little red paint pellets seemed 
to be removing more hair than 
the self-righteous idiot at the 
barber shop a few days earlier. I 
crawled to a higher part of the 
trench. I couldn't kill anyone 
from there so I slid down to my 
original position. I had crossed

the proverbial bridge-too-Iar and 
I was shot. It stung like crazy 
and I screamed "hit, I'm hit." I 
walked back, one hand holding 
my gun in the air, the other 
marvelling in the real feeling of 
the red paint, dripping from the 
welt on my forehead, where the 
pellet had exploded. 

What is this? It's capture the 
flag, I suppose , but I'm not 13 
years old anymore and this isn't 
summer camp in Palmer 
Massachusetts. This is 'TAG," an 
adult version of capture the flag. 
The game is the same as it was 
years ago, but now the method is 
not two-hand touch; it's to blow 
the crap out of the other 
weekend warrior before he (or 
she in a few cases) does 
something very similar to you. 

And there J was, in the middle 
of a Southern Cali fornia 

springtime, wearing Surplus U.S. 
Army fatigues and an LOY 
jacket banered off an Israeli cab 
drive r for a pair of Levi's and a 
Kodak Instamatic camera a few 
summers ago, I was holding 
some derivation of the Nel Spot 
C02 Pistol above my head and 
yell ing "hit , hit" while my 
metaphorical wound pumped 
ounces of metaphorical blood 
down my face. I wonder if the 
producer of 'The Three 
Musketeers" knew about this 
paint stuff. 

I arrived back at base camp to 
see Eric, who was in the other 
half of the Israeli cab driver's 
uniform with a huge paint 
splotch on his brand new grey 
sweatshin (bought at Pure Sweat

Which brings me to my last 
but cenainly not least imponant 
cri teria for trying to understand 
the reasons why I (or anyone 
else) watch soaps. The 
characters' names. Can anyone 
possibly try to understand 
~omeone who is named Shane 
{"Days of Our Lives")? Or how 

sure , soaps have the most 
attractive actors/ actresses 
around , but is this the sole 
reason? NO!! It's because soap 
operas teach us something that 
we can learn from no other 
source. They teach us how to 
handle a blackmail situa ti on, or 
what to do when you are a 
murder suspect. 

They teach us how to handle 
ourselves if we should ever 
decide to wear a seqUined dress 
to Peterson Hall in the middle of 
the day, or if we decide to 
seduce someone in the middle of 
the Rathskellar. But I think the 

"" ,this is where the ever popular 
'soap opera kiss' comes in, You know, 
the one that starts out slow and 
eventually fades out into a detergent 
commercial, .. " 

about Zed ("Capitol")? Even 
better are Buzz and Calla 
("General Hospital" and "Guiding 
Light.") I'm sorry, but these 
names arc utterly ridiculous. I 
would have a much easier time 
believing someone named Lisa 
rather than Celia or Palmer. Who 
thinks up these names, anyway? 

So, now that I have 
successfully explored the most 
vital aspects of a soap opera, [ 
still have not found the answer 

.as to why people watch them. It's 
certainly not the plots or the 
storylines, since they are all 
basicaUy the same, or the 
dialogue si nce they too, are all 
the same, or the wardrobe or 
names, So then, what is it? Oh, 

. 

most important thing that a soap 
opera teaches us is a strong 
sense of manners. Yes, you heard 
right, manners. Two characters 
from "Days of Our Lives" were 
noted as saying the following: 

"S he (Robin , the new head of 
surgery) has your Grandfather 
and the whole hospital board 
eating out of her hand ." 

"I JUSt hope that they don't get 
food poisoning. Perhaps I should 
warn them." 

Isn 't that nice of Mike to want 
to warn the community about 
Robin's hands? I think that we 
should all have a sense of 
concern for our nei~hbors; you 
never know who could be eati~ 
out of your hands. ~

thoroughly parched, since I had 
lost the bandana I had been 
using to try to keep the dust and 
grime off the inner linings of my 
trachea. Some of the guys had 
transferred from red paint pellets 
to silver bullets and Eric and I 
coughed and sputtered around a 
few of them in hopes of scarfing 
a beer, but the game leader was 
rounding us up for the next 
game. This one had been a tic. 

On the way out to the field , 
the man who had killed me last 
time with the death blow to the 
head, approached me, He had 
one of those amused, yet 
concerned looks as he shook my 
hand and rubbed my back. With 
about as much affection as could 
be expected from a mustached 
engineer in camouflage. he 
apologized and asked if I was all 
nght. We spoke until the two 
teams had to separate. 

We had run much faster this 
time, this in Itself presented 
some problems; the fellow in 
front of me lost most of his paint 
pellets and had to keep moving 
with no ammunition. I almost 
twisted an ankle, and our leader 
tripped down the steep but soft 
embankment, the Uppel edge of 
which had become our road to 
Hell and back. 

At some point, running left us 
too exposed. We tOok to 
crawling through the foliage. The 
exciting thing about the 
American Games' course is, 
although it is relatively small, the 
variations on the terrain are 
many. One moment we could be 

climbing over and around mongo 
boulders and the next slithering 
in an intense dirt pile. We were 
constantly on the lookout for 
Poison Oak, or • Agent Orange," 
as one of the guys at pizza called 
it, with his tongue sitting deftly 
in one of his cheeks, somewhere 
near a chewed piece of 
Canadian bacon. 

I could hear them ahead of me 
again, and I knew they had seen 
me. Their shots hit only the bush 
I was crouching behind. My 
haunches hurt like shit, and I 
had to constantly wipe off my 
goggles since the fog could 
almost have had a raincoat 
company named after it. 

I yelled "gonad" and the twO 
men behind replied "c runch" 
and I knew they were on the 
blue team; mine. 

Of course if I had thought 
about it they were directly 
behind me and my butt wasn't 
stinging and bleeding paint like 
a pervened hemorrhoid, so they 
must have been on my team. But 
now I was sure and I could talk 
to them. 

It seemed they were moving 
south and at the signal I sprinted 
and dove behind another big 
bush . Running without cover was 
a strange sensation, there was an 
incredible fear that at an instant, 
I would hear the rush of carbon 
dioxide and feel the sti ng and 
the wemess. I would have never 
thought I could find such a 
sense of accomplishment in 
reaching some insignificant 
shrubbery. This new position 
was attracting paint pellets like a 
first-rate recruitment officer, and 
we had to descend the hill and 
retreat. The entire week's 
overdose of John Wayne and 
Mac Bolan finally showed; with a 
skill I didn't know I even

possessed, I pulled a 
combination of tucks, rolls and 
dives through a desen hill, and 
survived. 

FinaUy the three of us were 
cramped together behind a few 
mid-sized rocks. One of the guys 
was Randy'S brother, Thai's 
father. and I realized fi nally that 
these two loving brothers were 
shooting each other, and what a 
crazy but somehow neat idea it 
is. 

I kept thinking what a terrible 
thing combat must be, as if I, a 
sheltered college student had any 
right to even pass judgement. Yet 
when I thought about it, all the 
criticism I received prior to my 
playing came back to me - all • 
the questions about the 
psychological effects of the game, 
etc . I remembered all the good 
stuff, too. My conversations with 
David Vaughan, who started 
'TAG" in San Diego; with Randy, 
the guy who was at Sutter with 
Jim, his brother. I remembered 
the man who shot me in the 
head and I couldn't forget Mr. 
G's. 

We turned in our guns after 
shooting everything in Sight with 
our extra ammunition. I 
wondered what a large red 
splatter would look like on the 
car, but I forgot about it as I 
neared my third Big Mac. Eric 
the biochem fanatic , was 
mumbling something about how 
our bodies were so spent, even 
though we hadn't really exerted 
ourselves that much, and he 
used sick words like epinephrine 
and A TP, and I tried to· nod with 
interest, as I thought about the 
next weekend - "Simulated 
Nuclear War," even if it is just 

,'the name of my apartment 
bl1ilding's upcoming progressive 
party. ~

Tritons hit the 
daily double 
vs. Whittier 
UCSD takes two from 
Division III rival, 9-3, 13-8 
By ROBERT WHITE 

G OlNG into last Saturday's double-header against Whittier, manager Lyle 
Yates made it clear. "We're going 
to need a sweep to keep our 
playoff hopes alive ." The Tritons 
responded by dropping Whittier 
twice by the scores of 9-3 and 
13-8. In the process, the Tritons 
battered Whittier hurlers for 29 
hits, as Olsen Field was raining 
baseballs from the potent UCSD 
offensive. The sweep putS the 
team at 14-14-1 overall and 5-3 in 
Division III play. More 
importantly, the Tritons have put 
together a five-game winning 
streak and appear [0 be running 
in high gear as the season wears 
on and the games become 
crucial. 

In the opening game, the 
Tritons were opportunistic, 
cashing in on miscues by the 
Whittier defense . In the third 
inning, with the score 1-0 
Tritons, Gary Fessia sem a long 
drive towards left-center which 
bounced off the glove of the 
centerfielder for a three-base 
error. Next batter David 
Stanovich brought home the 
freebie with a single to left. Later 
in the inning, junior Dan ' 
DiMascio belted his sevemh 
homer of the year to stretch the 
lead to 4-0. 

Whittier scored three times in 
the founh to close to within a 
run , but UCSD put the game 
away scoring four times in the 
sixth. Two singles and a walk 
loaded the bases for Fessia , who 
didn't need any gifts this time as 
he SIngled sharply to left scoring 
two. Then Stanovich, who was 

four for eight on the day with a 
homer and three RBIs, plated 
Fessia with a two-bagger. 
Catcher Bob Natal later brought 
him across with a sacrifice fiy to 
complete the scoring. Starting 
pitcher Casey Morales pitched 
four innings giving up three 
runs on two hits. Morales gave 
way to Paul Burke, who 
completed the game with three 
strong innings of scoreless relief. 

Game two proved to be more 
of a struggle after appearing as 
though it would be a laugher. 
UCSD scored four times in the 
first , highlighted by a lead-off 
homer by Stanovich, and a [\\10-
run double by Derek A1konis. 

However, Whittier fought back 
and took the lead 5-4 in the 
sixth . Earlier in the season, the 
team might have collapsed, but 
the surging Tritons showed 
character as they came right 
back and scored four times in 
their half of the sixth to take the 
lead for good . The game's 
highlight came in the seventh 
inning as Bob Natal, a threat 
every time he steps to the plate , 
launched a prodigious homer 
into the eucalyptus, well beyond 
the fence in the left center. 

In the past five games, UCSD 
has scored 56 runs and has 
earned admiration from 
opposing coaches and players. 
This week UCSD will face Biola 
University and Masters College 
to see if the Tritons can continue 
their winning ways. If they 
continue playing as they have 
lately, that playoff benh might 
come their way. 1m

Softball 6-0 in Conference 
play, SDSU Tuesday at 2 pm 
By GUS SANTOYO, Contnbuttng Editor 

I F YOU WANT ro go see a UCSD men's baseball game, you have ro go on 
a safari ro find Olsen Field, but 
the ballpark is, at least, on 
campus. Finding the UCSD 
women's softball team competing 
is a bit more difficuh. Don't look 
for them in the remote recesses 
of Warren . Instead, go about two 
miles · east of campus, near a fire 
and police station, to the Jewish 
Community Center, home of the 
UCSD women's softball team . 

The move for the team was a 
good one. They had been 
playing on Warren Field but 
decided ro move to the JCC 
because of the much better 
playing conditions. "The JCC 
provides a good field and we 
can get more fans there because 
we can seat them . The key thing

is that we have a dirt infield . It 
is hard ro be nationally ranked 
and have a grass infield and no 
dugouts. We're happy with the 
situation ," said head coach 
Colleeen Wight. 

Wight is also happy with the 
team's results this year. UCSD is 
6-0 in conference play and 16-
10 overall and is coming off a 
doubleheader sweep of Whittier 
College on Saturday, winning by 
the SCores of 8-2 and 7-4. Senior 
shortsrop Pam Hardaway had 
gone three for three, and' 
pitchers Patty Campbell and 
Charissa Hammett each had 
three hitters. Martha Bronson 
almost hit for the cycle as she 
had a single, double and triple in 
the second ,game. 

"Right now I couldn't pick a 

big weakness, we've been playing 
pretty well," said Wight. "Our 
bats are helping us a lot. There 
have been rimes when we've lost 
some of our intensity, but that's 
understandable because we've 
played so many games." 

Being undefeated in 
conference play has brightened 
UCSD's chances for a playoff 
bid. But winning the conference 
does not guarantee a playoff 
benh. "Our conference does not 
get an auromatic bid because 
there aren't six teams in the 
conference," said Wight, "but we 
have made it into the regionals 
the lasl two years because we 
have won the conference, and if 
we win it again this year, based 
on our reputation and winning 
record , I think we have a good 
chance." ~

SPORTS 

WI RI; To WI R~ll ~~~ 
Although many may scoff at me, I say the 

American League is what baseball is all about. There 
are still those classic old ballparks like Fenway, 
Comiskey and Yankee Stadium. In the National 
League you have Three Rivers , Riverfront and Busch 
- th ree stadiums about as personable as Tommy 
Newsome. It still is painful to watch the National 
League win all those All-Star games, but having 
grown up in Anaheim Stadium, I gladly picked the 
American League to preview. My esteemed colleague 
laughed at my choice, but the American League, to 
me, is still the best in baseball. 

American League West 
1. California Angels- There were a few rookies 

who have been penned as potential phenorns and 
Wally Joyner is one of those rookies. General 
Manager Mike Pon's Hrst good move was getting rId 
of Rod Carew - probably the biggest rally killer in 
the game - to open up first base for Joyner. If the 
pitching staff can get good years out of John 
Candelaria and Do, Sutton , the tortilla chips will b~ 
flyi ng at the Big A 

2. Kamas City Royals- The World Series 
Champions have caused me much pain in my life, 
but many have picked them to repeat. Hah! So what 
if they have a Hall of Farner third baseman (George 
Brett) who undoubtedly has the most gorgeous 
swing in the majors? So what if they have a Cy 
Young Award pitcher (Bret Saberhagen) that's only 
21 who has his best pitching ahead of him? Am I 
worried? Nah. 

3. Minnesota Twins- This team is about a year 
away from being a contender. The Koala's beloved 
Kent Hrbek is off to a g~at start and the other no-
names like Gagne, Gaetti and Brunansky should 
make the Twins a threat. They'd do much better if 
they didn't have to play in such a horrible ballpark 
(the Metrodome). 

4. Oakland A's- Another of those phenoms in 
the leagues is outfielder Jose Canseco, who is billed 
as the next Robeno Clemente. The A's are an 
average baUc\ub with no pizzazz. Where are Billy 
Martin and Charlie O. when you need them? 

S. Texas Rangers- Many have forgotten that the 
Rangers even eXIst. You never see them on the 
game of the week and their ace pitcher is an aging 
ex-Dodger knuckler named Charlie Hough. Need I 
say more? Well , actually Pete Incaviglia , the boy 
wonder who hit a ball through the fence is the only 
reason the Rangers will do this well this season. 

6. SUllIe Mariners- Possessing the ugliest 
uniforms in the league , the problem plaguing thl! 
Mariners is the Kingdome , or more aptly 
nicknamed, the Homerdome. The ballpark is a 
pitcher's nightmare , and the young pitchers in 
Seattle may not be able ro handle their ballooning 
ERAs. 

7. Chicago White Sox- The Hawk will pluck 
LaRussa soon. 

American League East 
1. New York Yankees- Watch out '27 Yankees. 

If George Steinbrenner can keep his ego out of the 
clubhouse and let Lou Pinella manage, the Yankees 
should win it all . Don Mattingly and Dave Winfield 
provide the power, Rickey Henderson the speed, 
Willie Randolph the defense , and Ron Guidry the 
smoke. The Bronx Bombers may be back. 

2. Detroit Ti8ers- As Kirk Gibson goes, so do 
the Tigers. After hitting an impressive two home 
runs on Opening Day, Gibson must have felt some 
son of reprieve after being snubbed by team owners 
and not getting a shot at big free agent bucks. 

3. Baltimo~- Cal Ripken , Eddie Murray and 
Fred Lynn have inspired fear in the hearts of 
pitchers. Earl Weaver has caused deafness in the 
ears of umpires. A young pitching staff is the reason 
these guys won't win it. 

4. Boston Red Sox- Jim Rice is on the down 
side or-his career, but he is still better than mOSt 
players in their prime. Wade "I hate beef" Boggs is 
arguably the best hitter in the majors , but the BoSox 
have no pitching. 

5. Toronto- \Vith upper management a mess 
after last year's fiasco in the American League 
Championship Series, Toronto will need a season ro 

recover with their new manager. Also , George Bell is 
the dirtiest player in the league since Ty Cobb. 

6. Milwaukee 8rewers- Who cares? 
7. Cleveland Indians- Cleveland State will win 

the NCAA BasketbaU tournament before the Indians 
struggle out of the cellar.

We are recognizing last Quarter's intramural bowling champions as ~ur first 
Miller U~ team of the week, Bowling is truly one of our most enJOYable 
intramural sports. Where else can you have a Miller lite, legally, smoke and

still be co~itive than at the bowling aney. 
Wiming the championship was the team 'Money For Nothing'. This squad 
obviously owns the hardv.<>ods at the Clairemont Bowl. This is their second 
title in tVv'O years. ~r 100 teams have bowled the last t'1NO years so that is 
quite an achie~ment My prediction is that the only thing that can stop 
them from wlming next year's championship will be graduation. 
Congratulations on a great season. H~ a Miller lite and celebrate.
