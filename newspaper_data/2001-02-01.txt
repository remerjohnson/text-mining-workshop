and religious conservatives, caught 
little notice.

Anti-Zionism Week Sparks Debate 
Student groups attempt to educate the campus on the issue 

Senior Staff Writer 

The Muslim Student Association is marking 
Anti-Zionism Week this week with speakers, 
videos and tables on Library Walk, sparking 
much debate on campus. 

UCSD's MSA President Eahab Ibrahim said 
he feels his organization has done a successful 
job in educating students on Zionism and the 
situation in the Middle East. 

"The main thing we're trying to accomplish 
is to make people aware of the situation of the 
Palestinian people and the effects Zionist phi-
losophy has had on them; he said. "I think 
we've done a decent job of that." 

Monday'S speaker, Richard Becker from the 
human rights group International Action 
Center, gave an eyewitness account of the cur-
rent state of Israel. 

He spoke of a double standard of justice for 
Jews and non-Jews in Israel, ana how non-Jews 
are often not allowed to go from one town to 
another. 

"Israel is pursuing a policy of strangulation 
- economic strangulation of the people living 
there; Becker said. 

Becker also gave a history of Zionism in the 
Middle East and distributed handouts detailing 

the changes in control over Middle Eastern ter-
ritory. 

Lila Hollman, a member of the Union of 
Jewish Students, said Becker had a commu-
nist take on his historical account of the 
region. . 

"There was definitely interpretation of his-
tory and he definitely left out certain key 
aspects of the history of the country: she 
said. 

. Thesday night's video, "The Land and the 
People," gave an account of day-to-day life in 
Israel. 

It depicted road blocks, the use of rubber 
and plastic bullets and the stopping of non-
Jewish cars by Israeli police. 

UJS President Wade Strauss said he thought 
the video was one-sided and somewhat outdat-
ed but acknowledged that it was an appropriate 
critique of Israeli policies. 

"It did address a lot of the things that did 
and do go on there; he said. 

MSA Treasurer Muslema Purmul said she is 
pleased to have people attending the Anti-
Zionism events. 

"We're hoping that people recognize the 
controversy; she said. "They don't have to

Student Life 
Referendum 
Meets Criticism 
Allocation of funds is at 
the center of debate 
By PATRICK LEE 
Staff Writer 

The proposed Campus Life Referendum 
was the subject of heated debate at a commit-
tee meeting Monday in the Chancellor's 
Complex. With the Feb. 2 deadline for cam-
pus organizations' funding requests rapidly 
approaching, the committee opened the tloor 
to public input on the referendum. 

While many support the Campus Life 
Referendum, which would potentially 
increase graduate and undergraduate quaner-
Iy fees by as much as $75, the bill collided 
head-on with fervent criticism and opposition 
at Monday's meeting . 

Among the topics of debate was the refer-
endum's goal of providing funding for the 
expansion of the Muir College Stuan 
Commons. Some in anendance, such as Mark 
Stickel of the Revelle College Council: see the 
item as inappropriate on a bill that, according 
to A.S. Council President Doc Khaleghi, is 
intended to benefit all of UCSD at once. 

"I don't see how a college-specific item 
should be on the table. It's not campus-wide," 
Stickel said. "How do I convince a Revelle 
student to vote for the referendum when this 
item affects only Muir students?" 

In response, Muir College Council Chair 
Cristina Villegas defended the item, pointing 
out that each of the university'S five colleges 
had the opponunity to submit a proposal for 
individual college expansion, and that Muir 
was the only college to have made a submis-
sion. 

"At least one-fifth of the students will ben-
efit from this item; Villegas said. "[The 
Stuan Commons[ is a huge pan of Muir life." 

According to Villegas, more than 30 stu-
dent organizations use the area for their vari-
ous meetings and events. 

Pat Danylyshyn-Adams, resident dean of 
Muir campus, also supponed the item's inclu-
sion in the referendum. 

"[Non-Muir[ students may also use the 
Commons; she said. "College affi liation is 
not required for that." 

Danylyshyn-Adams likened the dispute to 
the fact that, although not every UCSD stu-
dent is an intercollegiate athlete, the referen-
dum will most likely include funding aimed at 
making UCSD seem more like a Division ((

UCSD Receives Record Number of fall 2001 Applicants 
Minority applicants and SAT scores on the rise while average GPAs go down 
By MARGARET O'NEILL 
Staff Writer 

UCSD received more minority 
applications for fall 2001 in its sec-
ond record-setting year, while the 
overall minority percentages in the 
whole pool remain relatively 
unchanged. 

Freshman applications rose 7.6 
percent to 38,082 applications. 
The university also receiv«;d 6,936 

transfer applications, up 12.3 per-
cent from last year, making the 
total number of undergraduate 
applications a record 45 ,018. 

Among the freshman appli-
cants, sizable increases in number 
were recorded for all ethnicities. 
Applications of black students 
rose 10.9 percent to a total of 
1,192 of the 38,082 freshman 
applications received. Black stu-
dents submitted 3.1 percent of the 

fall 2001 freshman applications, 
up slightly from last year's 3 per-
cent. 

Freshman Mexican-America n 
applications totaled 3,537, or 9.3 
percent of all applications. The 
percentage of applications submit-
ted by Mexican-Americans rose to 
9.3 percent of the whole from 8.4 
percent in. the fall 2000 applicant 
pool. 

In addition, Latino applications 

. rose 9.6 percent to reach a total of 
1,155. Latinos submitted 3 per-
cent of the applications received 
for fa ll 2001 , the same as the pre-
vio lls year. 

Applications from Native-
Americans increased to 210 from 
last year's 186, a rise of 12.9 per-
cent. This is 0.6 percent of the 
applications received, up slightly

BRIEFLY 
Scientists Convert Leaves into Petals 

UCSD biologists recently discovered a 
process to alter leaves genetically so they take 
the form of petals. 

The biologists published their findings In the 
February issue of Current Biology, The findings 
describe how the SCientists found a new floral 
gene which, when combined with three other 
genes, creates the capability to turn leaves into 
petals. UCSD biology professor Martin F. Yanofsky 
conducted the experiment along with Soraya 
Pelaz, Rosalinda Tapia-lopez and Elena R. Alvarez-
Buylla. Yanofsky described the other genes in 
the May issue of "Nature" and explained how 
the mutation of these genes can create a "dou-
ble flower" where the petals, stamens and 
carpels of a flower all become sepals. 

The discovery will allow scientists to create 
entirely new plant species. 

Nominations Teaching 
Awards Being Sought 

The Academic Senate Committee on 
Distinguished Teaching, which is comprised of 
faculty and student representatives, is soliciting 
nominations for this year's annual Distinguished 
Teaching Awards. 

The awards will be given to a select number of 
faculty and graduate students who have made 
extraordinary contributions to UCSD as distin-
guished teachers. The committee will consider 
nominations from students and department fac-
ulty and will recommend a slate of candidates to 
be voted on by the Representative Assembly. 

Award reCipients will be honored at an 
awards presentation and reception in June. 

Nominations must include the nominee's 
name, the course or courses for which they are 
being nominated and a detailed letter explaining 
the quality and nature of the nominee's teaching 
effectiveness. The deadline for submiSSion is 
March 2. Addit ional details concerning award 
criteria and the nomination process can be 
obtained ,from the chair or director of the nomi-
nee's department or program.

UCSD Re_rellers Imitate 
Lupus Gene In Mice 

Researchers at the UCSD School of Medicine 
have discovered a gene in mice that simulates 
the systemic lupus erythamatous (SLE) disease. 

Lupus is a fatal disease in humans that 
attacks numerous organs and turns people's 
immune systems against them. 

The UCSD scientists published their findings in 
the Jan. 30 jssue of ' Proceedings of the National 
Academy of Sciences: In the issue, they explain 
that a mutation in an enzyme called alphaman-
nosidase causes the development of a systemic 
autoimmune disease that is similar to lupus. 

Approximately 1 million people in the United 
States suffer from lupus, according to the lupus 
Foundation of America. The discovery may lead 
to new treatments of the disease. 

The research was supported by grants from 
the National Institutes of Health and the 
Howard Hughes Institute, along with contribu-
tions from the Biotechnology and Biological 
SCiences Research Council and Welcome 
Trust. 

Cancer Center Researche,. 
Make Celli Self.Destruct 

UCSD Cancer Center researchers have dis-
covered a new way to make leukemia cells self-
destruct. 

The process began by using a two-drug com-
bination and coaxing a deadly cancer-causing 
molecule called Bcr-Abl from its command cen-
ter in the cell cytoplasm. Next, the team trapped 
it deep into the cell nucleus where it eventually 
self-destructed, 

Two drugs that the team found to be useful in 
this process were 5T1571 and leptomycin B,

Referendum: 
Marry supp:rt further 
revision Of the referendum 
university. 

Despite .his reservations concern-
ing the Stuart Commons, Stickel is 
an optimistic supporter of the refer-
endum. 

"Things are coming along," he 
said. 

While many support further revi-
sion of the referendum before it is 
voted upon, more adamant oppo-
nents of the proposal would like to 
see it scrapped altogether. Carolyn 
Gan of the UCSD Student Co-ops, 
along with other co-op representa-
tives, attacked the referendum at the 
meeting, calling it poorly framed and 
in violation of certain national, state 
and UC-wide regulations. 

Gan objected on behalf of the co-
ops to the Campus Life Referendum 
Committee's failure to follow proper 
procedure for initializing a student 
referendum. She reasoned that the 
referendum could not be considered 
to be entirely student run, as it was 
intended to be, since university 
administrators had hand-picked var-
iOOli committee members. 

She also said that a year 2000 
Supreme Court ruling requires that 
all student fees must go toward edu-
cation, leaving to question the refer-
endum's intent to further expand 
many of the on-campus university 
centers. 

Gan said the co-ops are calling 
for an end to the committee's 
"unnecessary inertia" in its efforts to 
pass the referendum. "We should 
take the time to do it right." she said. 
"Had we used a student initiative [in 
creating) the referendum, we would 
have avoided many problems." 

Gan said the co-ops are pushing 
for the dissolution of the committee. 

Probably the point of highest 
contention at Monday's meeting was 
the discussion of the recent removal 
of Graduate Students Association 
Vice President of Academic Affairs 
Kris Bohling as well another mem-
ber from the referendum committee. 

GSA President Lea Ruiz made 
the decision to withdraw the two as 
voting members on the committee, 
taking their places herself. 

"I made an executive decision to

Asian-American applications 
rose 7.3 percent to constitute 29.2 
percen t of the total for the fall 2001 
quarter, and Filipino-American 
applicants submitted 16.4 percent 
more applications than they did 
last year to make up 4.8 percent of 
the applicants. The Filipino-
American total for 2001 was up 
from the previous year's 4.4 per-
cent. 

Caucasian applications consti-
tuted 14,095 of the 38,082, a rise 
of 4.1 percent over last year, to 
make up 37.0 percent of the appli-
cations, down from fall 2000's 39.7 
percent.

on the rise since 1999. They rose

cations, as well as from African-

Anti--Zionism Posters Cause Controversy 
Signs posted around campus argued that anti-Zionism is anti-Semitic 
By VINCIHI' GllAINANI 
Senior Staff Writer 

Posters and flyers related to 
Anti-Zionism Week have been 
appearing all over campus for 
the past few weeks, some of them 
stirring much debate. 

MSA Treasurer Muslema 
Purmul and Revelle freshman 
Salma Shabaik on Monday 
morning removed a poster that 
stated "Anti-Zionism is inher-
ently Anti-Semitic." 

Purmul said she saw the 
poster as an attack on her, per-
sonally. 

"It's almost a deliberate 
attempt to misrepresent our 
image, to make us look like racists 

. when really we're anti-racist." 
Marcia Strong. adviser to MSA 

and the Union of jewish Students, 
said posters not bearing the name 
of the organization sponsoring 
them may be taken down. 

Punnul said she had been 
told that rule and therefore: 
thought it was legal to take the: 
poster down. 

"It's a free speech area," she: 
said. "It's my right to take it 
down. I'm not ashamed of [hav-
ing taken it down). It was a direct 
attack on me." 

She added that she had no 
intention to destroy the poster 
and that she took it straight to the: 
A.s. Council offices to ask about 
the legitimacy of the: poster. 

UrS member Lila Hollman 
said the removal of the poste:r 
was an act of disrespect. 

"It upsets me because we're 
talking about freedom of speech 
here and it should be respected; 
she said. "To have them come 
and take our stuff is really hurt-
ful ind ridiculous." 

The: poster is back up in the: 
Price Center, with the words 
"Sponsored by Union of Jewish 
Students" added to it. 

Flyers bearing anti-Jewish 
stateme:nts have also appeared in 
the Price Center over the past 
couple of days. The flyers bear 
no name or author. 

54.7 percent female, 44.7 percent 
male and 0.5 percent undeclared 
for freshman applications. The 
female-to-male ratio among appli-
cants has increased since fall 2000, 
when females constituted 53.9 per-
cent of the applicant pool and 
males 47.7 percent. 

Among transfer applicants, 
men's applications rose 15.5 per-
cent, while women's rose only 9.6. 

The largest section of applicants 
declaring a major (20.9 percent) 
applied to the social sciences 
majors. Science and math appli-
cants were 17.2 percent of the 
total, and applications to the engi-
neering majors constituted 18.1 
percent. The engineering majors 
saw many more applicants than for 
fall 2000, with a whopping 14.7 
percent increase. 

A total of 10,578 freshman 
applicants applied as undeclared 
majors, 29.9 percent of the appli-
cant pool. The arts and humanities 
majors pulled 3.6 percent of the 
pool apiece. 

The academic attributes of 
applicants remained similar to that 
of the fall 2000 pool. The average 
high school grade point average of 
a freshman applicant for next year 
,is 3.72, down slightly from fall 
2000's average of 3.73. 

The mean GPA of transfer stu-
dents remained stable at 3.26, the 
same as last year. 

The average SAT composite 
score rose to 1213 from 1211 . The 
two-point rise was in the verbal 
score average, which, this year, was 
587. The mean SAT math score 
remained 626.

Punnul called the flyers bigot-
ed and racist and said that no 
MSA or Arab Student Union 
member would have posted them. 

Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Joseph Watson issued a 
statement Wednesday in 
response to the flyers. 

"On Tuesday, a number of 
anonymous flyers were posted 
on the UCSD campus: he stat-
ed. "The unsigned flyers appear 
intended to anger the Jewish 
community and incite te:nsions 
between Muslim and Jewish 
members of the UCSD commu-
nity, The flyers represent cow-
ardly and disrespectful speech 
that conftiC1S with the UCSD 
Principles of Community and

Purmul added that she hopes 
the current controversy and con-
flict will lead to eventual peace 
and justice, comparing the 
movement to the civil rights 
movement in America. 

"I look at people like Martin 
Luther King," she said. "His 
position ' was to fight oppres-
sion. The people who rallied 
against them didn't understand 
what he was fighting for. He 
challenged the status quo. And 
look at what it led to.·Look at 
the rights African Americans 
have today." 

Ibrahim said he was dis-
pleased by the fact that Anti-

Zionism Week had created such 
a controversy before it even 
started, even though the contro-
versy brought attention to the 
event. 

"The main reason I feel the 
cha~es were put against us was 
to discredit us before we were 
given a chance to speak," 
Ibrahim said. "It has had an 
adverse effect in some ways, but 
in other ways it has brought 
attention to our week." 

Ibrahim added that if he had 
to do over again, he would only 
change the name of Anti-
Zionism Week if he could come 
up with an accurate alternative. 

"We would definitely con-
sider that; he said. · We were 
trying to come up with alterna-
tive titles for an exact descrip-
tion of what we were trying to 
do." 

Both Ibrahim and Purmul 
said, however, that no other title 
would suffice.

Nuclear Missile 
Defense Shield is 
an Unrealistic Goal 

President George W. Bush did not waste 
much time in affirming that a nuclear 
defense shield would be one of his priori-
ties during his administration . Nuclear 
defense was brought to prominance during 
the Reagan years under the title of the 
Strategic Defense Initiative, later deemed 
"Star Wars." Many claim that the money 
that Reagan spent on this pipe dream 
forced the Soviet Union to attempt to keep 
up financially, an action that eventually 
broke Mikhail Gorbechev's nation and led 
to its downfall. Giving credit to the SOl for 
the fall of the Soviet Union may not be jus-
tified, but the Guardian feels that attempt-
ing to finish the plans that the SDI started 
would be a mistake of catastrophic propor-
tions. 

It is now estimated that a nuclear shield 
would cost American taxpayers a dollar 
amount numbering in the trillions. Con-
sidering the fact that every trillion dollars 
that the federal government spends costs 
the average American about $3,500, the 
Guardian feels that this exhorbitant sum of 
money could be better spent elsewhere in 
the budget. 

Moreover, we are not certain if all our 
money and expertise can build a missile 
shield that would work properly. Tests have 
been less than successful so far, and most of 
these tests were done under conditions that 
make the shield more likely to succeed. 

. Success in life-like situations could be 
decades away or more. 

Another point to consider is the reac-
tion from other countries to the building 
of such a weapon.,All great nuclear powers 
now live under the shadow of M.A.D., 
meaning "mutual assured destruction." 
No nuclear country is likely to attack 
another because of its opponent's ability 
to fire back. Due to this system's imple-
mentation, no country has used a nuclear 
warhead in combat since the United States 
did in World War II. 

With the building of a missile shield, the 
U.S. government would essentially be 
counting down the seconds left in the life 
of M.A.D., and entice other countries to 
bomb the United States before they lose 
the chance. Even if the U.S. government 
plans to use the shield strictly as a defense 
mechanism, the major nuclear opponents 
of the United States will no doubt see this 
measure as a way of defeating a second 
strike, and therefore a way to make a first 
strike possible. This instability is another 
important reason why it should not be 
built . 

There is no doubt that Bush has some of 
the finest political minds in the world work-
ing for him. It is because of this that his 
decision to push forward with the missile 
shield is curious. Whether he is simply try-
ing to make Americans feel more' secure, 
raise his popularity levels from their current 
meager levels, or he thinks this plan will 
actually work, the Guardian feels he should 
reconsider his decision before he makes 
things worse.

Careful Examination of.Anti--Zionist 
Argwnents Sheds Light on Movement 

Both anti-Zionist and Zionist groups have valid points but unwillingness to 
compromise on either side widens chasm between the two 

By AllAN SADJA 
Senior Staff Writer 

With all the controversy over Anti-
Zionism Week, I felt a strong desire to 
abuse my status as a Guardian senior staff 
writer and completely tear apart the Anti-
Zionism Week arguments. I wanted to 
prove anti-Zionism to be the anti-Semit-
ic travesty that the Union of Jewish Stu-
dents purports it to be. As an Israeli Jew, 
I didn't see a difference between Zionism 
and Judaism, and Anti-Zionism Week 
seemed to be an event completely fueled 
by hatred - hatred of jews, my people. I 
was astounded that my A.S. funds were 
going toward something so atrocious. 

As an opinion writer, I could have sim-
ply written an opinionated piece based on 
my own assumptions without doing any 
research at all, and I did. I wrote an elo-
quently designed article reiterating every-
thing that you could read at the UlS booth 
on library walk. I even quoted Martin 
Luther King, Jr. But when Anti-Zionism 
Week was postponed, for whatever reason, 
I chose to do some' research into the top-
ics of Zionism and anti-Zionism. 

All of a sudden the controversy over 
Anti-Zionism Week took on a different 
nature ". and so did this article. I am not 
going to trash Anti-Zionism Week as an 
anti-Semitic event, to the dismay of 
many Jewish students and the pleasure of 
many Muslim students. . 

Anti-Zionism is not anti-Semitism. It 
is a religiously motivated political move-
ment against a religiously motivated 
political movement. Though many anti-
Zionist proponents may be anti-Semitic, 
the foundation of the movement is not. 

As with most controversies, the heart of 
this one lies in a fundamental misunder-
standing. In this case it is two differing 
interpretations of what anti-Zionism 
means. According to UCSD Muslim Cul-
tural Club President Eahab Ibrahim, 
MAnti-Zionism seeks to return the people 
of Palestine (Palestinian or otherwise) to 
the dignity that they had before the Zion-
ists had taken ova." If you ask UCSD UlS 

President Wade Strauss, Anti-Zionism 
Week is "equivalent to having Anti-Semi-
tism or Anti-Jew Week." 

To find the basis of this misunder-
standing, I had to define Zionism. Prior 
to 1948, Zionism was defined as a desire 
amongst Jews for a return to the Jewish 
homeland in Palestine. Its roots can be 
traced back as far the sixth century B.C., 
when Jews were exiled from Palestine to 
Babylon. 

More recently, in the late 1800s, 
Theodor Herzl brought Zionism to the 
limelight in response to various Russian 
and European "pogroms: or massacres 

Anti-Zianism is not anti-
Semitism, It is a religiouslY 
rrwtivated political movement 
against a religiously rrwtivated 
political movement. Though 
many anti-Zionist proponents 
may be anti-Semitic, the 
foundation of the movement is 
not, 

of jews. After the establishment of Israel, 
Zionism changed into a movement 
aimed at maintaining Israel's status as a 
jewish state, as well as making it possible 
for Jews all over the world to be welcome 
in their homeland. 

Anti-Zionism is more difficult to define 
concretely. Anti-Zionist sentiments have 
been around since before the Jews were 
exiled to Babylon and have seen a resur-
gence in popularity since 1948. Eve:n 
before Israel was established, there was a 
strong anti-Zionist push to prevent Jews 
from attaining Israel as their own indepen-
dent state. Modem anti-Zionism is 
thought of as a political movement seeking 
the return of Israel to its previous owners. 
Anti-Zionism is not particular to any reli-
gion, but it has a predominantly Muslim 

following due to the fact that Israel is 
located on land that was mostly inhabited 
by Muslims before 1948. 

Some argue that anti-Zionism is anti-
Semitism; let me dissuade those beliefs. 
Anti-Zionism calls for an end to Zionist 
activities, which may be considered racist 
against Arabs and the return of refugee 
Palestinians to their homeland, IWt the 
removal of Jews from their homeland. 

In the United States, we often pride 
ourselves on our separation of church and 
state. Israel may be the jewish homeland, 
but that is not an excuse to give Arabs and 
non-Jews second-rate: citizenship. Israeli 
Arabs are boycotting the upcoming Israeli 
election in order to make the statement 
that their vote means nothing. Having a 
Jewish homeland means a place to go 
where I can feel safe and at home among 
Jews, not a place where I want my non-
Jewish friends to feel ostracized. 

I am not anti-Zionist. Zionists were 
essential in founding and building Israel, 
and I applaud that. But in more recent 
history, Zionism has played a role in cre-
ating a major schism in the Jewish popu-
lation of Israel, and has been a stone 
around the neck for the peace process. 

When Yigal Amir killed Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzak Rabin in 1995, many 
people could not believe it was a Jew that 
killed him. Not only is Amir a religious 
Jew who cited Jewish-law as his reason 
for killing Rabin, he has been associated 
with many right-wing activities, activities 
that could be considered Zionist. Amir is 
an extremist, and I cannot say his views 
are expressed by all Zionists, but I will go 
so far as to say that many right-wing 
Israelis share similar, less militant views 
about the peace process. 

The faction between Zionists in Israel 
and those more willing to give: land for 
peace grows continually. This upcoming 
election only exacerbates the problem. 
With the recent Palestinian uprising. 
many Israelis are losing faith in the pos-
sibility of a real peace treaty.

Employers' Rush to Judgement 
Leads to Job DiScrimination 

Temptation Island Fails to 
Survive the TV Wars 
Controversial FOX show exploits 
relationships in the pursuit for high ratings 

PARISA BAHARIAN 
Unfortunately, I now know 

how a person who has been 
falsely accused of a crime feels 
when the guilty judgment comes 
in. Though my situation is not 
the conventional experience in 
which a judge, jury and jail are 
involved, the feelings when that 

. life-changing decision is imposed 
are almost identical in many 
ways. 

Helplessness, uner despair, 
anger and frustration reverber-
ate through your mind as the 
guilty sentence replays like a 
broken record again and again, 
or in my case, the decision to 
deny me a job because I have 
lUpus. 

Not unlike how a prosecutor 
may view a pile of prior convic-
tions as enough evidence to 
substantiate an arrest on new 
and unrelated charges, my 
potential employers' doctors 
looked at my medical history of 
hand pain and made the 
assumption that since I have the 
"big, bad lupus: I couldn't do 
the job. 

Funny, though, that no one 
questioned my abilities before my 
10-minute physical exam in 
which I disclosed I had mild 
lUpus. I had passed the required 
background investigation, inter-
view and polygraph test without 

any problem. 
But with the mere mention of 

lupus, bam, all my abilities and 
qualifications went out the win-
dow, and all that flashed in my 
potential employers' heads most 
likely was: Proceed with extreme 
caution - risk, risk, risk! 

This "rush to judgment" deci-
sion was made without any effort 
to collect the necessary evidence 
of my current medical condition 
of improved health over the past 
couple of months. It was almost 
as if once they knew I had lUpus, 
that's all they needed to know 
about me. 

So due to this "rush to judg-
ment: it wasn't surprising that I 
was denied the job in which I 
had so many hopes. 

The only upside to this 
unfair experience is that it has 
given me a new-found empathy 
with those who have been false-
ly accused and convicted for a 
crime they did not commit. 

I agree that my situation is 
really nothing compared to that 
of people who have lost their 
freedom in a miscarriage of jus-
tice - for once the guilty verdict 
is in, the life as a person knows it 
is gone. 

Yet that rush to judgment, the 
discrimination on the part of my 
potential employers, cost me a 
job that would have provided 
money for tuition and the needed 
jump-start to begin my trek into 
the legal field . 

But most of all, that discrimi-
nation cost me the right to 
choose my own destiny. For I was 
instead arbitrarily deemed not

So I pose these questions: So 
what if I have a chronic illness? 
Does that fact automatically

Franklin Roosevelt had a 
physical disability, yet it did not 
affect the job he did for our 
country. He led our country 
through the two major crises of 
the 20th century, the Depression 
and World War II. 

Would we even dare to try and 
tell Roosevelt that he couldn't be 
president because he had a dis-
ability? 

Maybe the better question to 
ask is: Did that disability deter 
Roosevelt from leading our 
country successfully through 
those two major crises? The 
answer is an unequivocal no. He 
is arguably the most influential 
president, and he did it all from a 
wheelchair. 

Disability and illness do not 
define a person, not if that per-
son doesn't let them. So why, 
then, do employers choose to see 
people in terms of a disability 
rather than by their qualifications 
and abilities? I submit that it's 
less of a risk to hire someone

FIND 
Roommates 

By CASSANDRA PIERCE 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Germans have a word, 
"Schadenfreude," which has been 
adopted into the English language. 
It means "pleasure from someone 
else's pain ," and it describes thl' 
only reason I can think of that 
someone would want to watch the 
new FOX show "Temptation 
Island ." 

The plot of the show is this: 
Four couples, each of whom have 
been together for several years, go 
to Ambergris Caye, an island in 
Belize, for two weeks. Once there, 
the couples meet up wi th 13 single 
men and women. The men in rela-
tionships choose a single man to 
vote off in "Survivor"-Iike fashion , 
and likewise the involved women 
choose a single woman to give the 
boot. 

Next, each contestant chooses 
a single member of the same' sex 
and blocks their partner from for-
mally dating this person. Of course, 
this heightens the attraction 
between the pair of blocked people. 

After this, the couples separate 
for two weeks straight, only com-
municating through occasional 
video messages delivered the next 
morning. The men stay in Captain 
Morgan's Retreat, and the women 
stay on the other side o( the island, 
across a jungle, in a hotel aptly 
named "Mata Chica," Spanish for 
"girl kills." 

While apart, the couples can do 
whatever they please. Prearranged 
dates with singles are common, vis-

and 
present 

iting places like the Maruba Jungle 
Spa for "intimate m'ild massages," 
or going to secluded beaches for 
picnic lunches, speed boating or 
scuba diving with sharks. 

This, at least, is what the show's 
producers tell you on the Web site 
and in the promos. They make it 
sound like a nice place, like sOl11e-
where I wouldn 't mind going wi th 
my boyfriend. But when the single 
women start betting odds for who 
can "hook it up" with a coupled 
guy, and when the host smiles that 
much, you know there's something 
wrong. 

The dates the couples go on are 
recorded on camera, and the night 
after each date, one person from 
each cou pIc ge ts to choose whcthu 
he or she wants to see their part-
ner's dates. The catch is, if they 
choose to watch, their partner is 
forced to watch thei rs. And if they 
choose not to watch , their partner 
cannot watch theirs. This "high-
light" video of each date is chosen 
by the producers and is usually the 
raciest part. The partners use this 
arrangement to spy on, hide from, 
or get revenge upon their mates. 

The dates themselves seem 
arranged to generate risque, or 
"Belize-style" shots as the produc-
ers put it. Upon entering the Maru-
ba Jungle Spa, one pair is told, 
"This is disposable underwear. 
This is what you 're going to wear. 
This and only this." As the girl of 
the pair put it, "It was hard to relax

Loss of Counselor Frustrates Students 
University must respond quickly in order to alle~iate problems 
caused by inadequate ,resources available to Visual Arts majors 
By RUTH TANG 
Staff Writer 

Megan Cunningham is the 
counselor for the Visual Arts 
department here at UCSD. She 
deals with more than 650 stu-
dents, helping them chose the 
right classes and make tough 
decisions about their majors. She 
basically helps each student in 
deciding his or her future. Her 
job is definitely not easy. Not 
only must she deal with [he frus-
tra tions and confusion of over 
650 artists, she has to do it all by 
herself. 

If anyone were to visi t 
Megan's office, they would fil'ld a 
long line of students ou tside her 
door. She is avai lable for just 3 
hours on Mondays, Wednesdays 
and Thursdays, and 6 hours on 
Tuesdays and Fridays. That 
might not seem too bad, but if 
you think about it, you'd change 
your mind. For example, say she 
was able to crank out a session 
every 10 minutes. 

That would mean that she 
would be able to see 18 students 
on Monday, Wednesday and 
Thursday, and twice that on 
Tuesday and Friday. That's 126 
students a week. That's with no 
breaks and no leeway, which is 
pretty impossible because some 

studen ts need more help. No one 
can work like a robot (although 
Mega n comes pretty close at 

. times) . Besides, there are over 
650 students! (1 do realize that 
in reality not all 650 show up at 
once, but it sure does feel that 
way when you're waiting all 

. afternoon for an appointment.) 
Cindy Fang, a second year 

ICAM major, said that she once 
waited ~O minutes in line, went to 
class, came back, and waited until 
the end of the day, and still was 
not able to see Megan. There are 
many stories of frustration and 
angst from the ICAM and VA stu-
dents concerning the lack of 
accessibility. Megan is well aware 
of the problem herself and has 
talked to her employers but to no 
avail. Now she has left and art stu-
dents will have to go to someone 
who does not possess the 16 years 
of experience that Megan does, for 
guidance. 

This ticks me off. I am a third 
year, tUition-paying student 
majoring in Media, and I expect 
the (miversity to keep my best 
interests in mind. I believe that, 
just as I am responsible for going 
to class and doing the work, the 
university has a responsibility to 
provide me with adequate and 
competent counselors to advise 
me on the best way in which to go 

about graduating. I do not believe 
that by refusing to hire someone 
to help Megan and letting her 
leave was beneficial to the stu-
dents in the least. 

It does not make me feel secure 
knowing that for the remainder of 
this year and the next, I will be 
going to someone who is new to 
Megan's job (since she was the 
only one doing it before) and is 
learning as he or she goes. After 
all , who's going to train him or her 
with Megan gone? 

Maybe I'm overreacting, which 
is doubtful, but it just doesn't make 
sense to me why the Art Depart-
ment would refuse to hire someone 
whom Megan can train to help her. 
You would think that they'd be 
tired of me throngs of students iliat 
congregate in the cramped court-
yard in front of me VISual Arts 
office, but apparently not. 
Although they might not mind the 
long lines, the students certainly do, 
and a new-be at me desk won't 
help to shorten them anytime soon. 

Think about that. Here we are 
paying all this tuition, (and over-
priced material fees if you've ever 
taken any VIS or [CAM classes), 
and they refuse to hire another 
advisor to alleviate not only 
Megan's suffering, but the stu-
dents' as well. Does this sound 
stupid to anyone else?

week not occurred, 
I would have never 
even considered 
the Muslim/Pales-
tinian argument. I 
would have 
assumed it was 
completely anti-
Semitic and 
brushed it aside. 
Instead I have 
learned a great deal 
about the Pales-
tinians' fight to 
regain their home-
land in Palestine, with Sharon as 

prime minister, years of effort toward 
peace will culminate in a war. 

I would never say Zionism is 
bad. Without it there wouldn't be a 
Jewish homeland. But I don't 
believe that any Arab should have 
been removed from his homeland 
to make room for a Jewish home-
land. The decision to split Palestine 
into Israel and Palestine has been 
the cause of many deaths, and in 
this situation, I believe no one is 
right: Jews have lived in Israel for 
centuries, since before the time of 
Christ. But so have Muslims and 
other Arabs, and there is nothing 
that makes the Jewish claim to 
Israel more persuasive than the 
Palestinian claim. 

Muslims and Jews alike cite reli-

because I looked beyond the 
rhetoric and found out the facts. 

I conclude by saying I am still 
pro-Israel but also pro-peace, .and 
pro-Iand-for-peace. This isn't just 
about an exchange of land for a 
halt in terrorism. Giving land back 
would be an acknowledgment of 
the former Palestinian homeland. If 
Jews deserve a homeland, so do the 
Palestinians, whose families have 
been there for centuries. 

Before I resign from this topic, I 
have one final message to the Mus-
lim Cultural Club: The biggest 
problem with Anti-Zionism Week ~ 
is its title. Why not "Pro-Palestine 
Week,· or something more posi-
tive, instead of an attack on a fun-
damental Jewish principle?

This is not my idea of a first 
date. I'm not sure I'd want to know 
the kind of person who'd want to 
be next to naked with someone 
they'd barely met before. 

Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I 
think of first dates as dinner some 
place - McDonald's, even - fol-
lowed by a movie or play, the girl 
and guy talking most of the rest of 
the time about who they are, try-
ing to figure out if the Other is the 
kind of person they wouldn't 
mind getting naked in front of. 

The people involved in this 
whole mess ooze hypocrisy. One 
of the couples lied on their appli-
cation papers, claiming that they 
had no children together when 
they had one, placing the child's 
life in turmoil. 

The show's host admits this, 
yet claims extensive background 
checks were done. On the first day 
after dating, the girls "feel worried 
about the states of their relation-
ships with their partners." To help

I'll agree that the show doesn't

blows off the fact that they all

Focus and Attention to the Music 
Listen to music and relax without all of the distractions found in other clubs 
By JOSEPH LEE 
Hiatus Editor 

When you realize you are frus-
trated and fed up with the music 
scene, you go ahead and create 
your own scene. 

After being burned out by the 
local music scene, musician and 
performer Chuck Perrin took mat-
ters into his own hands. Perrin said 
he was "frustrated by the lack of 
acceptable venues to present music 
the way I envisioned it." So he 
opened up a small space in down-
town San Diego, named it Dizzy's 
and dedicated it to music. . 

Dizzy's has torn down all of the 
distractions found at many other 
clubs, and placed all of its focus on 
the music itself. There is no bar or 
restaurant to divide your attention. 
Dizzy's is a place where you get lost 
in the sounds of the fantastic talent 
that comes to play. Perrin explained 
that more often than not, "per-
formers are competing with three 
or four televisions tuned to sports 
in other areas of the room." 

There are no such annoyances 
at Dizzy's. 

Nestled on the edge of down-
town San Diego's East Village, 
Dizzy's is a haven for jazz purists, 
blues musicians and folk perform-
ers. The small venue offers an inti-
mate setting as well as a high ceil-
ing that provides fantastic 
acoustics. Unlike other venues, the 
stage at Dizzy's is only eight inches 
off the ground and is set very close 
to the audience. This gives the peo-
ple the chance to interact with the 
musicians on stage, and it allows 
the musicians to connect with their 
audience. A professional lighting 
system gives way. to a slightly more 
laid-back feel with chairs that are 
set around small candle-lit tables 
on a concrete floor. 

As a bit more than a casual fan 
of jazz, and as a musician, I crave 
places such as these. I want that 
relaxed atmosphere where the 
focus is on the musicians and their 
music. In that respect, Dizzy's does 
not disappoint, because Dizzy's has 
eliminated all of the pretenses. 

Slide guitar player and New 
Orleans funk and blues performer 
Billy Thompson was the first act to 
grace the Dizzy's stage last April, and 
linle has changed since. As Perrin 
put it, Dizzy's "is what it is." I get the 
feeling that Dizzy's is not a place that 
will cave to the over-commercializa-
tion that turns artists into sales-gen-
erators and makes them a part of the 
background. 

"It's OK for a musician or artist 
to work as an actor for bar and 
restaurant owners, because that 
can pay the rent: Perrin said. "But 

for their sanity and growth as 
. artists, there has to be a place 
where the focus is only on the art." 

Dizzy's is a brick building that 
was built in 1913 and it looks cold, 
but when you step inside, there is 
more than enough warmth because 
of the hospitality and dedication. 
The entire ambiance of Dizzy's 
makes you feel like you've stum-
bled across some underground jazz 
club in a dark alley deep in the city 
where all the hip cats go to relax 
and listen to some soothing jazz. 

There are also paintings by local 
artist John DeMarco projected 
behind the performers, which depict 
legendary as well as local jazz musi-
cians. Perrin has described the venue 
as having a "New York City, Green-
wich Village vibe." 

Although the emphasis seems 
to be on jazz and blues, Dizzy's 
does book a wide variety of per-
formers. From bluegrass to spoken 
word performances and acoustic 
folk performances, Dizzy's has 
something for everyone. You can 
also catch Gilbert Castellanos host-
ing the East Village Late Nite Jam, 
whi~h runs every Friday from mid-
night to 2 a.m. Saturday. 

The O'Brien Brothers from 
Dublin , Ireland also recently 
graced Dizzy's stage and treated the 
crowd with an acoustic folk perfor-
mance with distinctive Irish influ-
ences. Band members Donal and 
Gerard O'Brien were in the States 
to promote their new album 
"Morning Sun: which can be 
found on their Web site at 
http://www. obrienbrothers.com. The 
dapper kids from the Ryan Mar-Tet 
played straightforward jazz and 
jammed for nearly two hours dur-
ing another perforrgans:e. So you 
can be sure to catch almost any 
kind of music on most nights dur-
ing the week. 

What is especially wonderful 
about Dizzy's is that the music is 
not limited to those who are 21 and 
up. It opens its doors to all ages, 
which gives many younger people 
the chance to go to a small club 
and listen to live music. 

You can also rest a bit easier 
knowing that 70 percent of the 
eight bucks you pay to get into 
Dizzy's goes directly to the artists. 
The other 30 percent just pays the

AaS. Festivals Release 
Winterfest Duds 
This year's list of artists who will not be attending 
., JOIIPH leE 
Hiatus Editor 

In the weeks before any major 
event, the festivals coordinators 
of the A.S. Couricil are hard at 
work trying to book popular acts 
to come to UCSD. But some-
times the bands who are being 
courted can't come here for one 
reason or another. Next week 
we'll have the official list of who 
is coming to Winterfest. As for 
this week, we 'll see the bands 
who snubbed UCSD: 

ATB - OJ Andre Tanneberger 
produced the massive club hit "9 
P.M. (Till I Come)," which pound-
ed through clubs from TJ to 
Europe. However, ATB suddenly 

changed his U.S. tour plans from 
February to March and may not 
even come to San Diego at all. 

EVE 6 - Popular alt-rock 
band caught the ears of the 
public with lyrics talking about 
putting a heart into a blender. 
They will be playing in San 
Diego the week before Winter-
fest . By the time Winterfest 
comes around, Eve 6 will be 
somewhere in the Midwest. 

EVERLAST - After spend-
ing some time with House of 
Pain, he went solo and even 
scored a duo with Santana. But 
he'll be in Texas during Winter-
fest and he can't change his 
plans. 

GEORGE CLINTON 
- Yes, we could've gotten the 
funk master himself but he's 
performing in San Diego just a 
few days before Winterfest and 
he can't stick around for the 
weekend. 

INCUBUS - This funk-
metal band from Calabasas want-
ed a lot of money. Money that we 
don't have for Incubus. 

SHAGGY - Winterfest or 
David Letterman? Shaggy went 
with Letterman. Forget him. Next! 

Wi/lterfest will be on Friday, Feb. 
23. UCSD students gd.in free with a 
can of food and there will be a limit-
ed amount of guest tickets available. 

Closed for Remodeling 
Club Ritmo takes a break in order to revamp and re-
open with Miss Jane and Sir Mix-A-Lot 
IyALIXJ.UI 
Staff Writer 

Ah, Friday nights. Truly, the one 
night out of the week that just 
screams for some first-rate 
debauchery. All clubs in San Diego 
that'll let someone under 21 enter, 
raise your hands .. .. Uh , TJ, any-
one? 

For years there has been talk 
about hosting some sort of night 
club at UCSD. At least, that's what 
A.S. Assistant Programmer Eisha 
Christian says. Along with fellow 
Assistant Programmer Anahita 
Ferasat and former Programmer 
Cassie Williams, she had a dream: 
to have the most happening 18-
and-over venue in all of San Diego. 

The creators wanted to produce 
a club that would be a great alter-
native to the city across the border 
for both students and the rest of 
the 18-and-over crowd in San 
Diego. According to Christian; the 
appeal of the club would be 
unique. 

Myou always hear songs such as 
'Funky Cold Medina: 'Baby Got 

Back: and 'Humpty Dance' in 
clubs: she said. UNow you get to 
see the artists themselves." 

Rob Porter of Porter's Pub 
offered the venue to A.S., and 
UCSD's very first night club was 
born. 

Orldly enough, a certain Latin 
pop star played a pivotal role in the 
development of the club. Enrique 
Iglesias ' song, "Rhythm Divine" 
proved to be just the inspiration 
the creative team needed when 
throwing around potential names. 
Williams said it was from that song 
that the name "Club Ritmo" was 
born. 

"We wanted something exotic, 
something unique, something peo-
ple would remember: said 
Williams. "As it happened, 'ritmo: 
which means 'rhythm' in both Ital-
ian and Spanish, was perfect." 

Christian wants the club to . 
become something of a tradition at 
UCSD, and also known through-
out San Diego. Christian promises 
the club will offer an eclectic mix of 
hip-hop, electronica and anything 
else you can groove to. 

Ferasat has high hopes for the 
fresh new club to develop and 
grow. 

"We have created a certain 
atmosphere we hoped to attain: 
said Ferasat. "So far it's gheno, but 
I can still dream! I just want it to be 
like the Pringles and Cheese Party 
Commercials!" 

The development of Club 
Ritmo hasn 't been easy and could 
never have happened without the 
help of many people. Christian and 
Ferasat would like to thank the fol -
lowing cast of people who have 
supported them from the begin-
ning: Scott Mantell, Kathy Lee, 
Tracie Davee, Steve Evans, Andy 
Livingston and the Deejays and 
Vinylphiles Club. 

Club Ritrno will take a break for 
the next few weeks and re-open on 
March 2 with headliner Miss Jane 
of "It's A Fine Day' fame. Acts for 
March 9 and April 6 are still to be 
announced. April 13 will feature 

~Baby Got Back" rapper himself, 
Sir Mix-A-Lot. You can do the 
"Humpty Dance" on May 4 with 
EJigital Underground. 

Nelly Furtado 
"Whoa, Nelly!" 

Sony Music 
A-

In the days of teen pop and porn 
on the radio, 1 have taken a step 
back from MTV drama and intro-
duced myself to a whole new musi-
cal experience, one that is both 
refreshing and inspiring. 

Nelly Furtado is an in-your-face 
19-year-old Brazilian from British 
Columbia who has been around 

HIATUS 11 

the world and back and is ready to 
tell you her story. 

Although self-described as 
"urban folk alternative: her debut 
album "Whoa elly! " breaks every 
attempt to stereotype by genre in 
the book. The closest description 
that comes to mind would be a 
Brazilian Fiona Apple, yet that is 
still way off. 

With influences spanning from 
L.L. CoolJ to the Smashing Pump-
kins to Hindu music, Furtado has 
blended folk, hip-hop, alternative, 
Portuguese. techno-pop and vari-
ous types of world music into one 
emotionally charged album. 

The first track, titled UHey 
Man! " introduces Furtado as an 
intelligent and eloquent artist look-
ing for someone to listen to what 
she has to say. 

If you go deeper into the album, 
independence becomes the theme. 
In "Party: Furtado sings, "Oh free-
dom, where do I beginll 'm chang-
ing my intlection of how I say the 
words." 

Furtado writes, "I was born to 
document the way I see the world 
and the experiences I've had in it."

of was suing the NFL so I could get 
back the four hours of my life it 
stole from me. 

There's a reason 
we're the #1 
MeAT course. 

Maybe last year's Super Bowl 
spoiled me. Now that was a game. 
The Tennessee Titans, after per-
forming a miracle just to get to the 
Super Bowl, comes within inches 
of tying the game as the clock runs 
out. 

There were stories behind the 
scenes - of Kurt Warner going 
from working at a grocery store to 
Super Bowl Most Valuable Player, 
of Dick Vermeil proving to all his 
doubters that he could win it all.

This Super Bowl had the story-
lines, but not the conclusions. 
Trent Dilfer had a chance to 
harangue the franchise and fans, 
WIIO after six years of abuse in 
Tampa Bay sent him packing, but 
all he could say was how he didn't 
have any hard feelings. Yeah Dilfer, 
it's easy to say that when you've got 
the Lombardi Trophy in your 
hand. 

Kerry Collins came into the 
game with the chance to prove he 
had merely been underachieving 
his whole career and finally shake 
off the alcoholic stigma attached to 
him. 

Sorry Kerry, and you can't even 
drown your sorrows away like you 
used to. Well hey, your next Zima is 
on me buddy. 

However, there was one story

that came to fruition. Ray Lewis, as 
congratulations for breaking his 
streak of killing pc;ople on Super 
Bowl Sundays, was presented the 
award for MVP by the NFL with a 
hearty handshake and a "Thanks 
for not killing anyone today, Ray." 
He then took his plaque and pro-
ceeded to beat the Disneyland rep-
resentative into a bloody pulp for 
choosing Dilfer to represent Dis-
neyland instead of Lewis. 

OK, that last part didn't happen, 
but if it had, there would have been 
at least some excitement associated 
with the Super Bowl. Even the 
commercials weren't that great, 
although Budweiser had a couple 
decent spoofs of its let-i t-die-
already "Wazzup" commercials. But 
come on guys, think of something 
else. 

However, after watching punt 
after punt after 'punt (there was a 
Super Bowl record 21 of them in 
the game), the commercials were 
almost a welcome relief from the 
two' offenses competing to see 
who could be worse. This is not 
how the Super Bowl is supposed . 
to be. 

In its first year in competition 
with the XFL, this is not a good 
thing for the NFL. It's a battle of 
sport versus entertainment, and the 
Super Bowl certainly showed that 
pure sport isn't always exciting. If 
the XFL can deliver any football 
with its entertainment, then . the 
NFL might have to start exploring 
new possibilities. Hey, I could dig a 
Super Bowl XXXVI between the 
NFL champion and the XFL 
champion. And to make things a 
bit more fair, Lewis could even 
bring his knife. In the XFL stab-
bing is only a five yard penalty. 

rugby is the fastest-growing colle-
giate women's sport, and interest in 
women's rugby is at an all-time 
high. 

At UCSD this is readily appar-
ent, as the women have seen a 
renewed interest in their matches. 
They have had big plans since 
being reinstated in 1996 and they 
look to see some of these well-laid 
hopes come into fruition in 2001 

If you are in the mood for some 
raw, hard-hitting, volatile sports 
action, you should head over to 
Warren field and check out the 
game for yourself. 

Upcoming matches include 
Saturday's battle versus USD for 
the men, and a women's tilt on 
Sunday against 'UCSB. 

The women hit the field at 11 
a.m. sharp. The men suit up at 1 
p.m. Be on hand at one of these 
sure to be thrilling matches to see 
the bastard child of William Webb 
Ellis in all of its glory.

Sterling Winans off an RBI from 
Mike Roddy in the eighth inning. 

The win gave the UCSD men's 
baseball team its first nonconfer-
ence win in Division II for the 2001 
season, as well as its first California 
Collegiate Athletic Association win 
of the season. 

Sullivan drove in three runs 
with 3 hits out of four plate appear-
ances. Junior pitcher John Beaven 
got the win for his first of the sea-
son in as many chances . 

Many players, such as senior 
Jess Warrington, believe that this 
season will be promising for the 
newest team in Division II. 

"We have lost some key people 
from last year's team for various 

SPORTS 15 

reasons, including our starting 
shortstop, who we were expectmg 
to get back," Warrington said. "We 
have had many people on the team 
that have had to step up into key 
roles, and judging by yesterday'S 
game, it looks like a promising sea-
son." 

The upcoming schedule seems 
favorable for the Tritons. They 
play Vanguard University this Sat-
urday, Feb. 3. The Tritons have 
had success against Vanguard; last 
year's ball club romped Vanguard

After that, it's on the road to

Anything but

ISAAC PEARLMAN 

W ell, on Sunday another football season culminat-ed with the Baltimore 
Ravens beating the New York 
Giants to win Super Bowl XXXV, 
or MXVZ, or whatever the stupid 
number is. 

Perhaps culminated isn't the 
right word. It's more like the drab, 
uninspiring football season gasped 
and spunered its way-to a standstill 
with about as much excitement 
and fanfare as the Absolutely Awe-
some Abs informercial on at 2 in 
the morning ($19.99 video cas-
sette) . And it's about as predictable, 
too: "How do you get such great 
abs? Sit-ups, every day!" 

Well, how do the Ravens win 
the Super Bowl? Score at least one 
offensive touchdown and rely on 
their defense, which they took care 
of early in the first quarter. The 
Baltimore defense played as expect-
ed, the Giants' offense played as 
expected, the coaches coached as 
expected, the cheerleaders pranced 
around as expected, and even the 
waterboys fulfilled their expected 
roles.

UCSD' Baseball Wins First 
Contest of the Season 10-3 . 
Lowly Cal Baptist University is no match for mighty Tritons as UCSD begins 
the 2001 season on the right foot, dominating its opponent 
By ARVIND YUAN 
Staff Writer 

After having its season open-
er rained out, the UCSD men's 
baseball team crushed Califor-
nia Baptist University, 10-3, at 
the Triton baseball field on 
Tuesday. 

With over a hundred people 
in the crowd, the Tritons took 
an early 2-0 lead after the sec-
ond inning. Tyler Sullivan sin-
gled to right field to bring in 
David Hawk and Eric Thorpe. 

California Baptist cut the 
deficit in half with an RBI from 
Oscar Enriquez that scored Dan 
Mahaffie in the third inning. 
Then the Tritons took over in 
the bottom of the fourth inning. 

First, Chad Addison got hit 
by a pitch with the bases loaded, 
driving in Tyler Sullivan. Ryan 
Larson then singled into center 
field to drive in Matt Smith and 
Blair Suzuki. Nathan Bestul 
drove in the final run of the 
inning with a pop fly into right 
field to score Addison. 

Thus, after the forth inning, 
the score read 6-1 in favor of the 
Tritons. 

California Baptist added a 
run in the top of the fifth 
inning, but another four-run 
inning in the seventh by the 
Tritons put the game away. In 
that inning, Eric Thorpe drove 
In Larson and scored off an 
RBf- . from Sullivan. Suzu ki 
drove in David Hawk to cap off 
the fo ur-run inning. 

All the California Baptist 
players could muster for a 
comeback was a measly run by

ScrumOn 
Rugby is making its 
mark at U.S. colleges, 
including UCSD 
By ICOn IURROUGIIS 
Associate Sports Editor 

The year was 1823, and a 
young ruffian named William 
Webb Ellis grew tired of con-
forming to the simplistic, one-
dimensional rules that dominat-
ed the game of soccer a-t the 
time. So this brash young vision-
ary plucked the ball from the 
pitch and ran down field with the 
ball tucked snugly beneath his 
arm. 

The other players stared on in 
disbelief at this hooligan 's 
actions, wondering if perhaps he 
had been patronizing the local

What they were unaware of 
was that they were witnessing a 
special moment in the history of 
sport. A whole new game had just 
been laid bare before their very 
eyes. It was to be named after the 
very school at which they were 
playing. That school was the 
Rugby School of England. 

Yes, rugby - the brutal, eye-
gouging, serum-busting spon 
came to be on that very square of 
pitch that very day. The game of 
rugby soon caught on at a much 
larger scale as Cambridge Univer-
sity adopted the sport and created 
a local set of rules. By 1871 , the 
sport had been formalized, when 
a professional league was estab-
lished in London. 

From there it spread across 
the globe like the bubonic 
plague, intriguing toned athletes 
and bloodthirsty prisoners alike. 
Here in the United States, the 
game initially caught on primar-
ily on the West Coast. It slowly 
established itself and looked on 
course to join the mainstream 
sports such as baseball, when a 
pixellated tragedy killed any 
hopes of an American pro league. 
Violent photographs of a rough-
and-tumble tilt between Swarth-
more and Pennsylvania were 
brought to the attention of Presi-
dent Theodore Roosevelt. 

His outrage resulted in the 
alteration of the rules of the tra-
ditional rugby game, which led 
to the introduction of the for-
ward pass and other changes, 
until it finally morphed into the 
game of football that we know 
today. While the true game is still 
played elsewhere around the 
globe, one of the only places that 
you will find the game stateside 
is on the green grass of its col-
lege campuses, including one 
tucked away down in La Jolla, 
Calif. 

The UCSD rugby program 
has enjoyed a long and storied 
history. The fact that the sport 
could be played with no more of 
an investment than the purchase 
of the ball was what first made the 
game appealing to the Tritons, 
but it was the intense game play, 
ample scoring and the opportuni-
ty for anyone to play that helped 
it stick around. 

UCSD boasts both men's and 
women's rugby teams. The men's
