health and personal reasons 
By PhIlip Michaels 
Staff Writer 

Anthony Jemi~on. the director of the Student 
Affirmative Action and Human Relation~ Coalition 
(SAA & HRC). announced his resignation from that 
position last month. 

The resignation. which took effect on Jan. 23. 
occurred in the midst of several university review~ of 
the Student Affinnative Action Committee (SAAC) 
program. 

According to Nick Aguilar. director of Special 
Services. Jemison resigned for personal rea~ons. 

Jemison could not be reached for COmme,ll. 
"[The resignation I is an unfortunate lo~s for the 

university. especially in that area:' said Aguilar.

• Counsel rule that co-op space 
agreements are technically invalid 
By Dan Krauss 
Staff Writer 

At this time UCSD Campus Police have 
no suspects in the incident. 

Another Koala staff member added that 
the most recent issue could have caused the 
acts. "Someone may have been offended by 
the 'Tucker and Watson Pick up Some 
Faggots' [article]. Ju t above that was 'In-
sane Man Forces Gay Lover to Use Contra-
ception· ... we received some complaints 
about that," he said. 

Prior to a meeting Monday between the student-
run co-ops and the UCSD administration. the UC 
Office of the General Counsel agreed to extend the 
temporary restraining order filed against the admin-
istration by the co-ops on Jan. 16. eliminating the 
need for a court date planned for Feb. 7. 

Steve Lutz, editor in chief of the Koala, 
speculated that the cause of the vandalism 
was dissatisfaction with over the content of 
recent Koala issues. He cited angry re-

UCBTakesSteps Toward Attaining Autonomy 
• Monday night meeting covers resolution, 
proposed charter and delayed pub renovations 
By FNlICIeco DeW. 
Guardian Reporter 

The conflict brewing between 
the administration and the Univer-
sity Center Board over the UCB's 
~ to act independently of the 
university administration was again 
discussed at Monday's UCB meet-
ing. 

AssisIant ViceOlancellorofStu-
dent Prognmunins and Facilities 
Tom Tucker responded yestenlay 
to Ihe mosI rec:ent UCB resolution 

in a lener to UCB Chair Molly 
McKay, in which he stated the 
UCB's decision "to delete the saI-
aryofthe Directorofthe University 
Center is inappropriate and not 
within the board's advisory role as 
defined by the University Center 
BoanIcharter."[nawriuenresponse, 
McKay refuted the administration 's 
aJOtroi overthestudent self-assessed 
facilities fee. "How is il thai you are 
allowed 10 define whaI is ·inappro-
priaae' use of studenc funds over the 

student representatives who have 
been selected to make these deci-
sions on behalf of all students?" she 
wrote. McKay also asked for an 
impartial hearing on the subject if 
the administration continues to 
refuse UCB authority over the real-
location. 

McKay said during Monday's 
meeting that she has contacted legal 
counsel to help with the UCB's at-
tempt to fight the administration 
over the resolution. Her meeting 
with Anomey James Cauley gave 
her reason to believe that the UCB 
has "a very strong case" in its at-

tempt to reallocate Carruthers ' sal-
ary. 

In another attack on administra-
tion control. McKay said she has 
drafted a new UCB charter that. if 
invoked. would give sweeping 
power to the UCB over the hiring 
and firing of personnel and over 
space allocation. McKay and the 
board discussed the charter at the 
meeting. relating new points to the 
older charter. including the place-
ment of the UCB under the direct 
supervision of Vice Chancellor of 
Undergraduate Affairs Joseph

Holmes said Watson agreed thai 
such v iolations would not lake place 
in the future. but Malek felt that only 
meanl violalions would not be as 
blunt. 

Malek said he thought Watson 
was saying, '''We're /lOl going to 
make any more mislakes. '" 

The Friday meeting included 
A.S. President Agustin Orozco, Vice 
President of Finance Joe Cassar. 
Holmes and Malek. 

According to Watson, no agree-
ments or admi ions of guilt were 
made during the meeting. "Whal I 
S:lid was, let' put those things aside 
and suppose the administration did 
violate (the PPMsJ ... Let 's move 
toward the future," he said. 

He added that he hoped he was 
not "naIve or overly Polyannish" in 
assuming that a clear understanding 
wa.< reached.

do not presenl a clear relationship 
between the AS. and the admini -

clarify the relationship, Holmessaid

According 10 Walson. Ihe meel-
ing was just the beginning and did 
not re!>Olve any issues. " I'm looking 
forward to our next meeling:' he 
said. 

Those attending the meeting said 

the issue of A.S. funding for c<H>p 
legal counsel was discussed. Ac-
cording to Holmes. the A.S. could 
fund legal counsel for the adminis-
tralion. but /lOl for the co-ops. 

Watson said the i~sue was not so 
c1earH:ut '" said, 'ye , if we're all 
one (entity(, cenainly we can use 
the money to defend one another, '" 
he said. 

Holmes said a major topic of 
discussion was the lack of respect 
between the students and the ad-
miniSlralion. "Watson agreed that 
there was good reason for students 
to mistrust (the admini \nltion(." 
Holmes said. 

Maleic was more emphatic in his 
interpretation of Watson' alleged 
statement. "The admini tration 
doesn't show any respect for stu-
dent ," Malek said. "If there is no 
respect, then we have to put more 
weight into what we say." 

According to Malek, the tudenr/ 
admini tralion relationshipwasdefi-
nitely clarified during the meeting. 
"It's bright as day to me now," he 
said, adding that he feels the admin-
istration is parental in its attitude 
toward students. 

Malek said that at one point in 
the meeting, the issue of ludent ·,

said of a possible mi interpretalion. 
"I would like another meeling." 

Walson said the AS. did di -
agree with him in many instance, 
such as on whether or not the AS. 
sh uld allocate money to a co-op 
lawyer. "That's their right - I 
Ihought the meeting was very for-

Holmes' view was not quite so 

positive, though he said that "what I

He said the A.S. will appoint a task 
force headed by Malek to look into 
the need for legal counsel for the

bad ince the '70s, when, he said, 
the administration rigged a student

Compared to students at other 
UCS, Malek said, UCSD students 
have little power against the admin-

he is going to have a low opinion of

Watson, on the other hand, be-

Media Center Receives Bomb Threat 
a,DlMneH ......... 
GulJldian Reporter 

A bomb threaa was received Tuesday at the 
Media Center/Cocrununication Building on the Third 
College campus. Sea Velasco, administrative assis-
tant to the Communication Department. received a 
phone call at approximately II a.m .• waming her 
that a bomb had been placed in the building. 

yard while the building was searched by campus 
police officer Nate Aoyd and Media Center Admin-
istrator Sherman George. 

"We were looking for anything out of place, 
things that didn't belong," George said. When asked 
why someone would threaten the Communication 
Department, George speculated that a disruption of 
midtenns might be the aim. 

"Hejust said '11'ere's a bomb. I'm sorry.' Like, 
'too bad: and hung up," Velasco said. She added 
that the male voice sounded to her like that of a 
Caucasian, 

According to the UCSD campus police, phoning 
in a deliberately false bomb threat is a misdemeanor 
and could mean legal repercussions of one year in a 
county prison. 

TIle building was inunediately evacuated. Stu-
dents, faculty and staff waited outside in the COUIl-

TIle last false bomb threat received at UCSD was 
in December, 1991. 

JEMISON 
ContInued from .... 1 
disappointment with the resigna-
tion. 

.. It's very frustrating right now 
not to have a director with the pro-
gram," said Consuela ScOIl of lhe 
Women's Resource Center. 

.. It's an adjustment. Like any 
adjustment, the kinks have to be 
worted out," she added. 

"I think SAAC at all times is 
vulnerable," said Monica Copado. 
president ofMovimiento Estudiantil 
Chicano de Aztllin (MEChA]. "It 
shouldn't be hurt. All the intems 
have been doing their jobs." 

The resignation, particularly its 
suddenness, came as a surprise to 
many involved with SAAC. 

"We saw him the day before he 
resigned. He didn 'ttell me about it, 
and we worked closely on Bradford 
v. RtKtfltS," said Copado, 

Jemison has been the director of 
Student Affinnative Action since 

the Fall Quarter, 1990. Before that, 
he served for a year as assistant dean 
at Revelle College. 

"All I can say is lhathedida very 
effective job with us," said Revelle 
College Provo t Thomas Bond . 

SAAC is cunently in the process 
of looking for a new director and 
also an associale director for the 
remainder of the year. Aguilar is 
also involved in examining the sta-
tus of SAAC. "Any time there is a 
vacuum in the leadership of a pro-
gram,l find it appropriate to assess 
the program itself," said Aguilar. 

Aguilar's assessment coincides 
with a review of SAAC by the Reg-
istration Fees Committee. Accord-
ing to Ellen Sherwood of the com-
minee, SAAC is currently under 
review for two cases. 

"One thing [SAAC] submined 
was an emergency funds request for 
clerical support," Sherwood said. 

SAAC made this request because 
of the problems with the UC budget. 
This year, organizations are making 

funding reque ts on a tempomry 
emergency basis and all requests 
are being reviewed. 

TIle OIhercase involves the pay-
ment of SAAC interns. This issue 
arose last year when lhe Regi tra-
tion Fees Committee voted to fund 
intems who sat on committees, pro-
vided the interns remained in an 
advisory position. 

"[Interns are] still being paid. 
They're just not serving as voting 
members of any committees," said 
Leon Mashum, the chair of the Reg-
istration Fees Committee. 

"We didn't feel it was right for 
them to be paid as voting members 
of the A.S.," he added. 

Before hi resignation, Jemison 
submitted a job description of lhe 
intemstotheRegistration Fees Com-
minee. The committee will discuss 
the issue at the end of thi month. 

"The committee is reviewing 
funding for the interns, but that's 
normal. This year iI 'S a little differ-
ent without a director," said Scoll.

I'll Take It, But I Won't Like It 
By James Collier 
Senior Staff Writer 

When ( was a kid I suffered from a mild case 
of bronchitL - difficult breathing and terrible 
coughs were the symptoms. Every ix hours I 
had to take this cough syrup-type medicine, and 
I did my best to avoid having to take the stuff. 

"Come here, James," my mom would ay, 
holding the bottle and a teaspoon. And off I'd 
run. 

"Corne on now," Mom would ay as she 
chased me (in her best " Invasion of the Body 
Snatchers" voice), "this 'll make you feel 
better. " 

After my mom caught me, he would stick a 
poonful of the medicine in my mouth while I 

screamed vainly for help. It was nothing like 
that Robitussin commercial - this syrup tasted 
nasty. 

In the beginning, I'd always pit that crap 
out. But my mom got wise. She'd pinch my 
nose and pour the Muff in. 

"h '~ for your own good," ~he'd say (sound-
ing Mrangely like Leonard Nimoy). 

I had no choice but to swallow the tuff, 

either that or stop breathing. My mom prob-
ably turned me into a secret Libenarian 
("Govemnent - Get off my back!") with her 
ultra-paternalism during the syrup episode. 

For the longest time I've avoided taking 
Muir 50 (an introductory writing class), but I 
only need two more classes to graduate and I 
finally gave in to taking the class this quaner. 

A couple of weeks ago my section was 
given a copy of the ';Muir Writing Program 
Guidelines on Non-Sexist Language." As I 
glanced through the guide I remember thinking 
how it was preaching to the already converted. 
But I was curious about these "guidelines:" 

"Is it mandatory that we write Ihis way?" I 
asked. 

"Yes," the instructor said. 
And suddenly I felt a little nervous. 
If I had been a freshman, I probably 

wouldn't have cared too much about thi non-
sexist language requirement. Call me cynical, 
but I've never liked the idea of someone forcing 
their ideology on me - even when I agree with 
it. I've always liked the idea that I have a choice

• Proposed bill is a step 
in the right direction 
towards abolishing 
restrictive speech codes 
By Matthew Robinson 
Associate Opinion Editor 

··AII issues are political issues, and politics 
itself is a mass of lies, evasions, folly, hatred and 
schizophrenia." So wrote George Orwell about 
our age and its polilics. Every aspect of daily life, 
he said, is permeated with political questions. 
There is a political pestilence which slowly creeps 
and corrupts everything it 
touches. 

Freedom can help halt 
this political plague. II 
allows ci tizens to alert 
their fellows of political 
dangers and hazardous 
si tuations. And nowhere 
is this more important 
than in the university. 

11le recent rise in 
"speech codes" and 
"fighting words" policies 
are the new challenges to 

f~ of speech and 
further proof of Orwell's 
insights. These codes 
promise that action will 
be taken against students 
or professors who breach 
a tatement concerning 
what ideas are inappro-
priate {o the university 
environment. 

Nearly two-thirds of 
all colleges have adopted 
such codes. This foct has 
drawn the attention of a 
few congressmen, most 
notably Idaho Senator 
Larry Craig and Colorado Repn:sentalive Joel 
Hefley. 80th have sponsored bills that require 
universities that ~eive federal fund.~ 10 guaruntee 
free speech. To those who are concerned with free 
speech and know the modem university, these 
bills are significant steps toward greater freedom 
of ideas. 

Craig's biIJ ould halt federal fund.~ to those 
colleges that threaten free speech by"instituting 
behavior codes and hamssment policies thai 
require 'politically correct' speech, with the effect 
of suppressing unpopular viewpoints." 

The biII is aimed at communicating the 
principle that free speech is invaluable to the 
university. According to Brooke Robens, a 
legislative aide to Craig, the bill is designed for 
the "prevention" of speech codes that restrict free 
speech. In addition. it makes administmtors take a 
look at the codes they are instituting.

Pm/tssor Ptltr Irons: As far as I know 
there has been no suit thai has been filed or 
that is close to being filed. I do know that 
they had planned to file suit more than a 
year ago, but the plaintiffs they had 
recruited for the case. who were mostly 
from minority student organiz.ations, 
changed their mint;S.'l about iL I'm on the 
litigation committee, and I haven't heard of 
any suit being prepared. I have I feeling 
that the suit is being sort of stalled because

l'Ulell you generally how that carne 
about. I can't tell you the name of the 
person involved. What happened was-
and it's sort of ironic because I was puning 
together a program on speech codes for the 
Warren Symposium -this was in the 
spring of 1990. I had pultogether a 
hypothetical case for our moot coon based 
on a white male student who had verbally 
harrassed a black female student. When I 
was discussing this with my Civil Liberties 
class one day, one of the students came up 
to me afterwards and said, "'This is weird. 
but my roommate was just charged under 
the speech code here for saying almost 
exactly the same things your hypothetical 
said. " So I got together with this student, 
and offered to represent him. 

The university decided, in their wools, to 
make this a ''tesr C&'ie" of the speech oode ••• 
........ _ ........ ewwr 

lbal was the first case in the university, 
in the entire system. I think. 

The facts of the C&'ie, basically, were that 
it ... grew out of a traffIC dispute. The male 
student, who in Ibis C&'ie was himself a 
nK;ial minority - he was .. Asian - was 
involved in a bumper "bumping" owide 
one of the campus parking lots with another 
student, who apparently got out of her car 
and beaKne extremely verbally abusive of 
the male student, who responded by making 
a racial slur. He never denied what he said. 
What he said, actually, was "Get back in 
your car you big black bitch." 

He, at this time, was sitting inside his car 
with the window rolled up, and was in no 
position to assault this person, They 
continued this verbal dispute in the parking 
lot but there was no physical contact 
between them. She called the police from 
the patiUng lot and he was 8l'1'ested in his

was not under the influence, and the 
university decided to proceed against him

He never went to a hearing. I think 
largely this was because the ACLU 
declined to provide .representation. I was 
doing it as a volwJ\eer. The ACLU would 
not take the case because it was compli· 
cated by the OIher charges. 

My feeling at the time was that they had 
not made up their mind whether to chal-
lenge the speech code or not. 

I felt then, and I still feel, that the 
university is using the speech code as an 
alternative to actually dealing in a meaning-
ful way with the problems of racial 
conflicts on campus. 
.......... , .... ., ...... 
prall ••• , 

Well, for one thing, the administration 
is still unwilling to institute real programs 
of racial and ethnic education or orientation 
of incoming students. For one thing, I've 
discovered that [these students) know 
nothing about this speech code. It· s nOl 
even given to them or explained to them. 
The university has 001 instituted any kind of 
programs to deal with problems on campus 

within the dormitories or elsewhere. 
The speech code itself is simply an 

excuse. It's also very dangerous because the 
university official who administer this 
code have admilled, in public ... that they 
consider remarks that deal with subjects 
like a person 's weight or hairstyle to be 
punishable. [Warren College Dean I Denise 
Campbell even said that she thought any 
kind of comment relating to a person's 
appearance that would make them feel 
uncomfortable, like calling someone fat or 
ugly, would be punishable. They're clearly 
not within the reach of the speech code.

At the Warren Symposium, Denise 
Campbell and (Director of Special Student 
Services] Nick Aguilar said they have no 
idea what the standards are. They may 
come up as they go along.

Well, Nick Aguilar told me that none of 
those had gone to a hearing. My guess is 
that they coerced or threatened those 
students into accepting sanctions. My guess 
also is that none of[those cases I would 
have stood up in coun.

I don't know the details of the cases. My 
guess is that none of them really involved 
the kind of harassment that would satisfy 
any legal definition of harassment.

The Supreme Coun is going to decide 
very soon. It's already heard arguments in 
this case from Minnesola - the cross-
burning case. My guess is that it will nlilke 
more clear the reach of Ihe fighting words 
doctrine. Most con~titutional scholars 
believe that the fighting words doctrine, 
which goes back to 1942, is no longer good 
law. It 's been undermined by subsequent

That 's my point. There is no need forthese

are perfectly valid, and can be ,~nforced. 
They're constitutional if they ' re applied cor-
recti y. The part of hamssment is that someone 
has to be placed in physical fear ... You can't 
harass somebody solely through words that 
do not connote some kind of threat. For ex-
ample, if somebody calls you up every morn-
ing at 3 a.m .. that 's a form of harassment no

6 OPINION 

LEGISlATION 
ConIInued hm .... 4 

Jeff Crank, aide to Representive 
Hefley, says the bill's focus is that 
"Congress hould be accountable 
for its funds." That is, it ought to 
know where its money is going. The 
concern is that congressional funds 
are making their way to universities 
which use them in tum to linance 
code of behavior. 

The hope is that the bills will 
cause byzantine university admin-
istrators to reflect on the codes they 
are creating. Those code , which 
force students to confonn to their 
images about the proper ideas stu-
dents should hold,should be changed 
voluntarily by admini trators. 

Of course, most university tu-
dents are not of such a nature that 
they will abuse their freedom and 
hurl harsh words at one another. But 
till universities coerce students with 

theornnious hadowofpunishmenL 
In addition they hide their machina-
tions underthe fig leafoffreedomof 
peech and "diversity" for all. 

Already a number of court case 
have invalidated variou speech 
codes. For instance, the University 

of Wisconsin' code was judged 
unconstitutional on the grounds IhaI 
it docs not provide the Mdiversily" 
its supporters contend. The judge 
decided that the code "docs as much 
to hurt diversity on Wisconsin cam-
puses as it does to help it. By estab-
lishing content-based restriClionson 
speech, the rule limits the diversity 
of ideas among students and thereby 
prevents the ' robust exchange of 
ideas' whichintellectuaJlycampuses 
provide." 

Of course,an impor1antqueslion is 
what this means roc UCSD. The Wis-
~n code is almost idenlicallO our 
own '"fighting words" policy thai so 
artfully masqUCl1lde5 as a code that 
proteCtS diversity and freedom. 

Craig and Hefley's bills larget 
such codes. But they do so by put-
ting the onus on administrators to 
examine the codes theycreare. They 
are not designed to attack political 
speci lic . Rather, they restate the 
idea that universities are free for 
inquiry. Their strength i in their 
generulity. 

Craig' bill, which has passed 
partially in the Senate, has of course 
unchained a demon that might very 
well rampage through Congress. 

The UCSD Guardian 

Hints of this were seen as some 
Democratic senators, pllticuJarly 
RhodeIsiandSeMlorClaybome PeU 
and Illinois Senator Paul Simon, 
toolt excepcionto section five, which 
assened thai federal funds are being 
used for such freedom-restricting 
codes. 

Thi i the nasty aspect of poli-
tics that Orwell was talking about. 
Democratic senators are afraid to 
accept section Ii ve because it would 
require action. If federal funds are 
thus being misused then members 
are responsible to taxpayers for why 
freedom of speech is being 
squelched with their money. 

This claim will be examined in 
late February or early March when 
the Senate debales the Higher Edu-
calion bill. Unfortunately, the Hefley 
bill has not been able to make it to 
the floor for discussion. It has hit a 
roadblock. There is no one to intro-
duce the bill to the House Education 
and Labor Committee. 

There is only a one-word differ-
ence between the bill . Both pr0-
vide forprohibitionsof speech which 
are already deemed constitutional. 
The di fference i that the Senate bill 
prov ides for prohibition when safety 

is jeopardized. The House bill adds 
the word "physical" to describe 
conditions where safety i endan-
gered. 

Of course, modem university 
students support a university where 
ideas can run free and challenge 
other ideas. The idea that _ todents 
need mental or intellectual protec-
tion from their fellows is naIve, 
hypocritical and ignorant. The uni-
versity is a place for freedom of 
ideas and words are the vehicle to 
IranSpOftthoseideas. Hinder words. 
and the idea is dead. 

University students, adminisrra-
ton and politicians should realize 
thai goodness and compas ion to-
ward others is only possible in a 
fu:e envirorunenl. Legislating, en-
couragingorprotectingspecchends 
with the result that people live hypo-
critically and are forced to act 
"good." 

Free speech cripples debate, 
fosters suspicion and forces people 
toconfocrn to someone else's ideas 
about how we should live. Ulti-
mately, it forces the university en-
vimrunent to come under the gaze 
and guardianship of political au-
thority and vagary.

can" in a paper for a class, I hould 
have the right to use the exact word 
that I would to use-whether or not 
my instructor feels it is the politi-
cally correct-tenn to use. 

All students should be allowed 
to express their ideological beliefs 
without hanning their grades. Even 
if a Muir Writing instructor has to 
read a paper with sexist or racist 
language, who is it really huning? 
Not the other students. Even if in-
SbUClors read papers thatoffend their 
sensibilities, so what1 Aawed think-
ing is better than no thinking at all. 
It's part of the learning process. 

I've read the argwnents for why 
the Muir Writing Program has set 
up their current guidelines for non-
sexist language, and their arguments 
are pretty reasonable. But it doesn't 
change the fact that I'm forced to 
adopt their non-sexist ideology. 

I could just see my instructor 
temng me: "Come on now, it's for 
your own good." 

Sure, I'll admit that it might even 
be good for me to have to deal with 
sexism in our language, but just 
because I have to take my medicine 
doesn't mean I have to like it.

thai Groundwork's spa lease has 
I10l been tenninaaed. In addilion. 
Beam Wrote, "The administration 
cannoc compel GroundWOlt Books

111enI •• ' 

Monday's meeling yielded sev-
eral new developments. according 
to Steve DubbofGroundwori. "The 
universilY conceded lhaltheadmin-
iSlration didn'l follow due process, 
thai Groundwork i a saudenl orga-
nization, and thai Groundwoct can'l 
be compelled to be a conlracl ven-
dor. The administration was rebuked 
by their own counsel," said Dubb. 

Beam agreed lhal the adminis-
Inltion was panly 10 blame. "It ap-
peared 10 me that all lhe people 
involved had made mistakes and 
Ihat there was miscommunication. 
There were problems on all sides," 
she said. 

"Finally the administrruion spoke 
10 the General rUniversity] Counsel 
and found oullhallhey' re not above 
lhelaw liketheylhoughltheywere," 
said Dubb. 

Despite the university's conces-
ion, Dubb said the co-ops are still 

facing major difficulties. "(The ad-

miniIII ..... ) is p1ayin, pmcs -
still. 1bey aRclaiming IhIIthe lase 
apeemellIS with the co-ops amI't 
valid. " he said. Aa:ording 10 Dubb, 
Beam claims IhIIthe space ape-
menIS with the CCHlpS are I10l valid 
because UCB Direclor Jim 
Carruthers did I10l sign the agree-
menrsas stipulated in the UCBchar-
ter.lnaddition, Dubb said IhaI Beam 
a1soclaims lhat the agrcernents can 't 
be made for more than a year at a 
time. "[The administration) is play-
ing on a lechnicality. II's silly, but 
thai's what they're arguing," said 
Dubb. 

Cohen said, "My clients and I are 
perturbed that, while the adminis-
tration backed off on its improper 
demand that Groundwork become a 
contract vendor, the contract lease 
was considered voitl t-y theGeneraJ 
Counsel. Tucker has made it clear 
thai the contract will not be renewed 
unless the contract vendor staIUS is 
accepted by Groundwork." 

Cohen felt that this action was 
"legally incorrect" for a number of 
reasons. One rea on IS that 
Carruthers did negotiate and ap-
prove the agreements. Furthennore, 
they were approved by hi supervi-
sor and Carruthers's designee ex-
eculedboththe 1992 and 1993 agree-

.a:onIina 10 Cohen. is IhII "the ~ 
op5 have delrimentally relied upon 
[the space apecmerlll." 

Beam contends that her claims 
are juliIiflCd by the specifICations of 
the UCR charter and that she has 
accoultled for the fact thai the ~ 
ops have relied upon the current 
space agreements. "Carruthers 
should have siped, but he didn'I ... 
Despite thistcchnical problem. I did 
acknowledse thai the co-ops fell 
they had an agreement and that we

Beam said that because the co-ops 
felt they had a valid agreement. they 
will be allowed until June 30 to 
decide if they want to become a 
contract vendor or remain under 
university control. 

To UCB Chair Molly McKay 
thi deadline is unreasonable. "[The 
administration] is Irying to make 
the space agreernenllast only until 
summer. They'll wait for lhe stu-
dents to leave and then they'll evict 
the co-ops," she said.

UCB 
ContInued from pac. 1 
watson. McKay's draft has been 
circulated to olher UCB members 
and is in the process of being rev ised 
before a lawyer reviews il and il 
comes up for a vote in the UCB. 
Because of the current debate over 
the UCB's control over its budgel, 
the board i searching for a way to 
fund legal counselor find an allor-
ney willing to work pro bono. 

McKay also lold Ihe board that 
lheuniversity's legaicounsel,Joanna 
Beam, has infonned her that Ihe 
deadline for Groundwork Books to 
reach an agreement with the univer-
sity i set for June 30, just after 
summer break begins. McKay i~ 
worried that the administmtion will 
wail 10 acl 10 remove the co-ops unlil 
lhe students have left tor vacation 10 
avoid a backlash. Such fears were 
heightened by Cauley' s waming that 
the university might legally be able 
10 nullify the space a1localion agree-
menlS with Ihe co-ops because 
CaffiJthers never officially "signed 
off' on them. The deadline for an 
agreement with the other co-ops re-
mains Feb. 17. 

During Monday's meeling. the 
UCB alsodi cussed plans 10 bailout 
Ihe stalled Trilon Pub renovation 
project. The molion would call for 
tapping into the University Cenler 
Capilal Reserves accounl 10 make 
up Ihe $40,000 difference between 
Ihe c urrent projecl budget and the 
actual cost estimates from the low-
e I contmctor bid. TIle plan will be 
voted on al next week's meeting. 

The renovalion bids from con-
tractors were higher than had been 
previously expecled and put the en-

tiP 

tire project in doubt. The Triton Pub 
was originally expected to re-open 
last fall , but due to cost ovemms and 
other complicalions, conslruction 
has yet to begin. 

McKay told board members 
Monday Ihat Ihe delays have be-
come "an embarrasmenl" 10 the 
UCB. even though Ihe problems 
have not really been the board's 
fault. She went on to say, "At this 
point we need 10 CUI our losses. W e 
need 10 get Ihis pub renovated." 

Members of Ihe board expressed 
their worries over the competency 
of the lowesl bidder. "That low bid-
der is committed to Ihat amount and 
we will force il down their throat." 
CaffiJthersremarked Althoughsuch 
worries remain. CaffiJthers said Ihat 
the contrnctorha.~ tohaveall changes 
in the specificalions officially ap-
proved by Ihe uni vers ilY and thallhe 
contractor must insure Ihe yuoleu 
cost through an insurance company. 

The Caplial Reserves fundexists 
10 absorb the coslS of unexpected 
minor repairs and as a precaution in 
case of emergencies. The approxi-
malely $2.1 million in the account. 
and the use offunds for Ih is purpose 
is unprecedented. according to board 
members. Graduate Studenl Asso-
ciation (G A) President and Repre-
sentati ve to the U B Denise Fenlon 
~aid the plan has received "pproval 
from Vice Chancellor of Under-
gmduule Affairs Joseph Walwn. 
However. she suid, Watson empha-
sized Ihal this is a one-lime occur-
rence. 

Fenton said Ihat Watson views 
the pub renovation as "ex tenualing 
circumstances" because il is a mu-
tual Associuled Students. GSA and

, Basketball Soars Over Hawks, 105-96 
• Win streak up to 12 
games as Tritons scorch 
Christian Heritage with 
63 percent shooting; 
Moore hits for 35 points

it tends to become second nature. 

The UCSD men's basketball 
team ha~ been winning for a long 
time, and it's beginning to look like 
nothing more than everyday rou-
tine. 

Christian HerilageCollegejoined 
the long I ine of teams that have been 
downed by the Tritons in recent 
weeks as UCSD moved past the 
Hawks 105-96 on Tuesday. 

Just as a reminder, the Tritons, 
who have now won 12 in a row and 
are I 6-4 overall , haven't lost a game 
since December of last year, and 
that was to Division I University of 
Wa.."hington. 

But if the Tritons continue to 
perform a.~ it did on Tuesday night,

The Tritons shot a blistedng 63 
percent from the floor again t the 
Hawksand were led by Chris Moore. 
who nailed 16 of 22 ·hots to tie a 
UCS D record for baskets made in ;1 
single game. Moore fini shed the 
evening with 35 points. a career 
high. 

As ha~ been the Tritons· sty le in 
recent weeks, T ucMlay night's game 
looked like an early blow-out. Moore 
was already 9 for 10 shooting and 
Chri tian Heritage just didn·t look 
like it could keep pace with the up-
tempogameas UCSOledby 19,55· 
36, at the end of the first half. 

With an offense thut featured 
some 10ng-nUlge shooting and what 
UCSD Head Coach Tom Marshall 
called a "helter-skelter defense, '·the 
Hawks managed 10 make only brief 
runsattheTritons:mdcoulddo little 
more than dent UCSO·s halftime

UCSD Can't Keep Up With Claremont, Loses 59-54 
• Shots don't fall for 
women's basketball as 
Athenas take victory 
ByGNaW ..... n 
Associate Sports Editor 
_ Except for one element, the 

women's basketball team played a 
pretty good game Tuesday night. 

Unfortunately, that one missing 
element was shooting, and it's hard 
to win if you can't put the ball in the 
basket. 

That was Tritons' problem as 
they traveled to Claremont, losing a 
close game, 59-54. 

The game was tied at 54-54 with 
I: 15 left and the Tritons with the 
ball. 

However, they couldn't get off a 
decent shot and the Athenas grabbed 
the board. A quick foul by UCSD, 
and Claremont was on the line, and 
then up by two after making both 
free throws. 

It wasdijiJ VII the next time down 
the floor. 

Again the Tritons put up a weak 
shot, and again the Athenas were 
able to pull down the rebound. An-
other UCSO foul, and this time 
Claremont convened one from the 

charity line. 
A final Claremont bucket iced 

the victory a few seconds later. 
"We just couldn't get any shots 

10 fall:' said UCSD Head Coach 
Judy Malone. "Our shot selection 
wasn't very good." 

Defensively during the game. 
the Tritons were forced to swi tch to 
a zone defense to respond to a 
Claremont offense designed to take 
advantage ofCari Young's injured 
knee. 

"Cari was covering a fOIWard , 
and they just kept driving on her 
becausetheyknewhermobilitywas 

off," explained Malone. "So we went 
to the zone to keep the drives from 
happening:' 

The Trilonsalsohadtrouble with 
Claremont's Amy Cleveland, who 
burned UCSO for 24 points. 

Offensively. UCSO managed 
only 36 percent shooting from the 
floor. but still was able 10 keep up 
with the Athenas for mosl of the 
game. ··Wejust didn't hit the shots 
at the end there:· said Malone. 

Lisa Beaver led Ihe Tritons. scor-
ing 14 points and grJbbing 10 re-
bounds while Kathleen Alvarez 
chipped in II points. 

Volleyball Responds Under Pressure to Spike __ ....... 
By Kirsten Halverson 
Staff Writer 

Men's volleyball's first win of 
the season came Tuesday night, 
when it defeated the University of 
La Verne 15-6,15-9,17-15. 

1be victory was long in coming 
for UCSD. especially after a disap-
pointing loss to UC Irvine on Satur-
day. 

UCSO Head Coach Rod Wilde 
sai "The team was a lillie down 
afterSanarday's loss so we refocused 
them in practice on Monday." 

Wilde wanted the team to play 
up 10 itacapabilities and no( to hold 
anything back. 

UCSD came oul strong in the 
first game, quickly taking the Le0p-
ards 15-6. 

La Veme began serving in game 
two and leaped out to a 3-0 lead. 
The TrilOlll fmally woke up when 
they were behind. 8-4. 

"We dido', get off to a real good 
start," said Wilde. 

1bree net violaliom and two ser-
vice enon called apinsr La Veme 
helped UCSD aet back inlO the 
game. GIme two went to the Tri-
tons. 15-9, 

The intensity ofllle mIlCh picked 
up in pille three. 

UCSOdominated the game from 
the first serve. The Tritons lead was 
maintained until 12-5, when there 
were 10 sideoulS awarded before 
the Tritons finally won point 13. 

La Verne picked up five points to 
close the gap to Ibree. A UCSD 
service error gave a sideout to the 
Leopards, who won another five 
uncontested points to lead the game 
15-14. The Tritons held their ground 
to win the ganlC, 17-15, and tbe 
match. 

Wilde was pleased with the 
team's perfol11WlCe in the pressure 
siruarion. 

"I could have called a time-out 
but I wanted the team to stop their 
opponenl from coming back on their 
own," said Wilde. 

There were several substitutions 
early in game Ibree, which is rare for 
the Tritons. 

Wilde said, "We had the oppor-
tunity to use some different people 
in !he third game." 

Bruce Williams played well for 
die Tritons. He had nine kills in 16 
artcmplS wilh only two errors for a 
contribution of a .438 hitting aver-

uted eight digs. 

"Lamson Lam pve consislent

play for the evening," said Wilde. 

Lam posted a .333 hilling aver-
age on the night and had seven kills 
wilb only three errors. 

"Man Brega did a good job run-
ning the offense with consistent sets 
all evening," said Wilde. 

Wilde stressed the imponance of 
the performance since it has been an 

area of concentration in earl ierprac-
tices. 

Brega played in all three games

Triton Golf Beats Occidental 
The UCSD golf team won its 

season opener by defeating Occi-
dental, 312-347 in Pasadena on 
Monday. 

Medali t Tony Ager paved the 
way for the Triton win with a five-
over-par75. Otherscorers forUCSD 
included Jeremy Moe with a 76. 
Man Stooem who shot a 79. and 

M. HOOP 
ContInued from pace U 
ness in UCSD's efforts to shut 
down the Hawks' offense, which 
was more than content to hit from 
out ide. 

Still. Christian Heritage did 
manage to nail II of 17 from 
three-point country and were 
paced by Shane McKin's 26 
point . 

In addition to Moore, UCSD 
had four players in double figures 

Tom Brown who ended up with an 
82. 

Occidental was without its top 
two golfers. "With their top two 
guys out, they're in real trouble," 
UCSD Head Coach Mike Wydra 
said. The Tritons golf on Friday 
against Whinier. 

-a,..Wrenn 

on the nighl. 
John Spence had 17, while Rick 

Ban had 15. 
Lusain and Jackson had 13 and 

II respectively. 
Batt led the Tritons in rebound-

ing as he pulled down seven and 
Spence and Moore grabbed six 
apiece. 

Just for good measure, Jackson 
dished off 13 as ist ·. 

Perhaps the most important re-
sult of UCSD's win was its jump in 
the mnkings for Division 01.

Toreros Shut 
Out Tritons 

In what is one of their toughest 
matches of the year. the UCSD 
women's temis team lost 9-0 to the 
University of San Diego Toreroson 
Tuesday. 

The Toreros, rooked in the Oivi-
sion I Top 20 according to UCSD 
Head Coach Liz LaPlanre. were just 
too much for the Tritons. 

"These girls just hit the ball a loe 
harder ... WejUSlcouldn't makethe 
put-aways." LaPlante said. 

Robyn lnabo, the Tritons' num-
berone singles player,was beaten 6-
0.6-0 by USO's Tracy Ishii. 

Inuba wasn 'tthe only Triton not 
to win a game. She was joined by 
Catherine Vim. UCSD's number 
three singles player. who lost her 
match to Tuck Kachroen. 

Carla Nicolas. the Tritons' num-
ber two singles player, did manage 
to win four games in her mouch as 
shewasdowned6-3.6-1 by Torero 
Maddy Diekmann. Diane Chandler. 
UCSD's number five singles player, 
also pulled out four games in her 
match. losing 6-4. 6-0 to USO's 
Karen Laner. 

Amanda Lynch. the Tritons' 
number four singles player. dropped 
her contest to Paula Hansen 6-1, 6-
I. And the Tritons' number six 
ingles player Michelle Wilbur, won 

two games in her 6-2. 6-0 loss to the 
Torero's Laura Mannisto. 

LaPlante said she used the match 
as a "tune-up" for Saturoay's home 
opener against Occidental. 

The Tigen will be UCSD's fint 
Division m opponent, and LaPlante 
is confident that the Tritons will win 
the match. 

Saturday's match will be at 10 
a.m. on the Muir couns. 

- Chris R._ 

Yesterday the Tritons moved up 
one spot from number five to num-
ber four. 1l1ey are currently mnked 
tir.>t in the Western Region. 

Still, Marshallassens that UCSD 
must now focus on upcoming games 
and not let up. 

"IWe've) got to make sure that 
the guys go into every game men-
tally prepared as well as physically 
prepared." he said. 

"It's really important that we all 
maintain our concentration level 
now."

COVER STORY 

(Clockwise from left): Gypsy, Joel Hodgson, Tom Servo, and Crow. 

The first time you see it, up in the high end of the cable tele-vision channels, you might think it' s a kids' sh w - a grown man in a jump uit and 
two cheap-looking robots, 

seemingly made from household items, 
standing in front of a set that looks l>ome-
thing like a ~paceship. 

But this show. Comedy Central's 
"Mystery Science Theater 3000" (Fri-
daysat 10 a.m., Saturdays at 1:30a.m .. 10 
a.m. lind 7 p.m.), is perhaps the smane t 
and most inventivecornedy show on tele-
vision today. Tens of thousands of people 
nationwide. ranging from schoolchildren 
to the middle-aged. are members of the 
show's fan and infonnation club. 

"My tery Science Theater 3000:' or 
"MST," has been prai 'ed as "ingenious 
and often inspired tel vision" by The Nell' 
York Tillles, and as an "instant cult clas-
sic" by The Wall Sf/'eer Journal, was 
given rave reviews by 1VGllideand USA 
Today . and was most recently nominated 
for the ACE award for be t cable comedy 
series. 

The show' s premise is silly and imple: 
A hUlllan (played by seriescreator and co-
executive producer Joel Hodgson) and 
twO robots are forced tow3tch some of the 
worst movie ever made. Silting in the-
ater chairs at the bollom of the movie 
screen, the trio responds by making fun of 
the movies - with s ide-splitting com-

Comedy Central's "Mystery Science Theater 
3000" goes from hit local show to instant 

national cult classic

ments and hilariou ly obscure references. 

"We shock a lot of people about just 
how bad movies can get." Hodgson ex-
plained. "I mean, we'redealingin films that 
the general public would never, ever watch 
or ce." 

While the movies Ihat appear on the 
-how seem to be the worst anyone has ever 
seen, the show's creators say that movies 
like "Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster," the 
biker epic "Wild Rebels" and the recycled-
from-TV "MasterNinja" areoctually among 
the best of the films they receive. In a 
package of20 films sent to the"MSr'team 
by Comedy Central, perhaps one or two 
films are actually usable. 

"It 's hard to keep people interested i f the 
movie has absolutely nothing going on in it, 
if it doesn't make sense," Hodgson said. 

"MST" first appeared in late 1988 at a 
mall independenuelevision station in Min-

nesota. Series co-producer Jim Mallon ap-
proached Hodgson, who had made a name 
for himself in comedy by making several 
appearances on "Saturday Night Live," to 
do a comedy show. 

"We just staned doing it, and it was very 
successful," Hodgson said. "It was incred-
ibly low-budget. .. but people really re-
sponded to it, and we had [a fan clubl of 
over 1,000 back then. It really helped us feel 
like we had hit a nerve." 

Thunday, February 6, 1992 

About a year later, cable TV's Com-
edy Channel (which later merged with the 
HA! channel to fonn Comedy Centml) 
approached Hodgson and Mallon about 
producing the program for a national au-
dience. 

"When we were approached to do it on 
cable. we were in a great position ... we 
had done 22 shows already, and knew 
how the thing worked," Hodgson said 

1be production team at Hodgson and 
Mallon's company, Best Brains, works 
almost year-round producing the show, 
which is now beginning its fourth season. 
Each episode takes eight days to produce, 
and the staff takes a week-long vacation 
after every five episodes. 

1be writing process begins with the 
team of four staff writers and various 
contributing writers silting in a room, 
watching the movie and rattling off hu-
morouscomments, whichareentered into 
a word processor. 

"We go and rip on the movie . .. just 
like you would in a home," Hodgson said. 

"We spend the first writing day going 
through the movie and throwing out lines," 
said writer Trace Beaulieu, who also plays 
both the robotic Crow and evil scientist 
Oayton Forrester. 

1be next day, the writers work on 
between-movie sketches for Hodgson and 
the robots, as well as the evil scientists.

WIll,. Is CoInI.., C.lblll, Allyway? 
Perhaps the 

worstthi,. 
about "Mystery 
ScIence 

Theater 3000" Is 
the fact that It's 

on harQ.to.fInd Comedy Central. 
In San oteco. the network Is 

located on Southwestern 
Cable's chameI 37, and was 
added on Dec. f to Cox Cable's 
chamel 46. But Cox subscrib-
ers who aren't yet part of the 
system's upgraded area won't 
be able to receive the chamel. 

Approximately one-thlrd of 
the Cox system, mostly In the 
south bay and EI Cajon areas, 
can receive the upgraded 
channels. This year. another 
third will be upgraded, and by 
the end of 1993 the entire new 
system will be on-lIne, ~ 

~ to Cox ProgrammII1l 
CoofdInator Sharon I<onz.. 

Comedy Central was orw-
nally two different networks. the 

MTV-owned HAl network and 
HBO's Comedy Chamel, which 
~ broadcast " MST .• 
AttIJr a year of competition, the 
two networks merged. 

Almost half of the network's 
procranvnl,. Is original, 
Includq& the award-wlnning 
"StancHJp Stand-Up,. "Inside 
the Comedy Mind" with c0me-
dian Alan ~ and the hip

In addition, the network r&-
runs post-1980 "Saturday 
Night LiYe" episodes, "Monty 
Python's Rying Circus,· and 
Canadian sketch comedians 
"The KIds in the Hall. " 

The network has even 
touched UCSD. Revelle College

he P ychedelic Furs will continue their World Outside tour tonight at Sound FX in 
Clairemonl. World Outside, which i the Psychedelic Furs' eighth album, was released last 
July. Many claim thaI the new band, with its new album, is better than ever. 

The band includes three of its original members, Richard Butler, Tun Butler, and John 
Ashton, as well as new members Joe McGinty on the keyboard, Knox Chandler playing 
second guitar and ceUo, and classically trained drummer Con Yallech. 

Tim Butler, one of the Psychedelic Furs' founding members, recently took some time out 
of his busy pre·lour schedule to talk with Hiatus.

Lewis Moon, a half-Cheyenne In-

struction of the Amazon Rainfor-
ests. He is joined in his effons by 
four missionaries who don't h:lve a 
clue about the Indian cuhure, bUI do 
have pure motives. 

omething about Mallhiessen's 
novel drove top Hollywood icon 10

At the outset, Newman, Marlon

of Lewis Moon. Then the manage-

John Huston was asked to direct, 
with Gregory Peck and Kirk Dou-

necessarily for the Moon role. That 
arrangemenl fell through, and Rich-

with David Bowie showing inter-
est But this fell through, 100. 

While Hollywood foughl and 
bickered, MUllhiessen went on liv-

AUTHOR 
ContInued flam .... H7 
struggle of the American Indians 
against the govenunenl. centering 
around the I97S shootout between 
the Indians and the FBI near 
Wounded Knee. South DukOia. 

After the shootout. Leonard 
Peltier was convicted oflhe killing 
of two FBI agents and was sent to 
prison. In his book, Matthiessen 
gives evidence that Peltier, an 
American Indian. is innoceni. This 
incident and the ensuing coon case ' 
became a central pan in • 
Manhiessen's life, consistent with 
his fascination and appreciarion for 
Indians around the world. 

He became close friends with 
Peltier's brother and many of the 
Indians who were atlhe shootout. 
In the May 1991 issue of rile No-
tion, Manhiessen gave even more 
evidence of Peltier's innocence. in-
cluding an interView with the man 
who really did kill the FBI agents. 

Indeed. the topics of 
Manhiessen 's books giveevidence 
to his reverence for theeanh and his 
concern for the oppressed. Even in 
his non-fiction books, his narrative 
flows in almost poetic fonn, ex-
lracting rave reviews from even 
finicky critics. 

A desire to be at peace with 
himself is evidence of his devotion 
to Buddhism, and this desire for 
peace seems to flow from the char-
acters and places he writes about. 

Matthiessen's multicultural ac-
counts of the many diverse people 
of the world are sensitively and 
expenly presented, whelher they 
be in fiction or in non-fiction fonn. 
He proves through his aclions Ihat 
he is a great figure in nol only in 
literature. but also in history, en-
gaging the beauty of the land and 
the perspectives of the people.
