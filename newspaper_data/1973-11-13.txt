Third College Construction To Start 
Construction of Third College's 

Academic Unit I will begin this April. All 
buildings in this first of three phases of 
academic structures will be ready for 
occupancy by December of 1975. The 
building site is located betwe n the 
Centra l Library and Muir College . 

Four buildings will be includ d in 
Academic Un it I. The stru tures ar "C", a

Building materials will be concrete and

Earth-tone wooden facing panels will add 
contrast to the edifidces . The cumulative 
effect of the low-rise concept and building

Two additional phases of Academic 
Buildings will be added to the Third 
College campus . Academic Unit II will be 
totally devoted to the social sciences. 
Permanent buildings will be constructed to 
house such majors as Urban and Rural 
Studies and Third World Studies . This 
second step is due to open in September of 
1980. 

Taking advantage of the building site's 
rolling hills, some of the structures will be 
dug into the hillsides . Students will enter 
the second floor of several of the buildings 
from ground level because of this . 

Extensive landscaping, planned 

Powers describes the Third College 
locale as "one of the most plea ant on 

throughout the project, will be completed 
by January of 1976. "We are retaining 
every tree of salvagable value," Powers 
emphasizes . He added that though the

hard sciences, is tentatively set to open in

McElroy Issues Ce~ter Statement U(~ Affirmative Action 
Hoping to assuage what 

As i tant to the Chancellor 
David Ryer termed "am-
biguity" surrounding the 
Univ rsity' position on the 
propo ed Town Cent r, th 
Chanc Ilor 's office has 
rei as d a 9-pag 
background pap r, in -
orporatin g the U SD 

position, a hort history of 
th Town Cent rid a, and a 
qu stion-an w r e tion . 

I n a hort preface to th 
pap r, addressed to "a ll 
m mbers of the U.c. San 
Di go community, 
Cha ncellor William 
MElroy comm nt d, "We 
plan to endor e the concept 
of a multifunctional center 
b cause, on balance, a well -
planned and integrated 
center of this kind seems 
preferable to the likely 
alternatives." 

The paper strongly states 
its concern that plans for 
the Center remain within 
guidelines dictated by the 
University Community 
Plan, formulated in 1971 by 
"the City of San Diego 
Planning Department in 
cooperation with citizens of 
the commu nity, UCSD, and 
various other 
organizations ." 

According to the paper, 

tl the administration hopes " that construction of the Center as an "economically 
viable entity" will prevent 
'''spot-zoning' and helter-
sk Iter development", 
factors whi h the school 
f el will lead to Lo 
Ang les-type urban sprawl .

Requirements 

The background paper 
also includes a copy of 
McElroy's statement to the 
University Town Center 
Associates, the firm that 
will implement the Town 
Center plan , comprising 
specific requirements for 
the Center. UCSD threatens 
to withhold its support 
unless the specific 
guidelines in the position 
paper are met. The general 
position of the University 
follows : 

"The development of a 
well-p lanned Town Cen-
ter ... imp lements the 
University Plan and is 
considered to be in the best 
interests of U.c. San Diego 
and the adjacent com-
munity. A vital, active 
center of residential , 
cultural, civic, commercial, 
and recreational activities is 
considered essential to 
provide a center of interest 
for the University Com-
munity. A stated in th

(Preface : In keeping with the editorial policy of the 

Triton Times, this column has strenuously avoided 
trying to convey any semblance of truth . However, last 
Friday's touching editorial on page two provoked the 
low Blows and Cheap Shots news staff to inject a few 
doses of fact into this week's turkey . 

We are sorry that pictures of all the interviewees 
could not be provided . But by the sheerest coincidence, 
one of the RA's was pictured in last week's column . 
Unfortunately, policy forbids us to use her name.) 
Student seen throwing balloons : 

LB&CS : Do you think your actions could be con-
sidered to be those of a pig? 

Student: (laughs) No. 
LB&CS : What do you think about th is watertight? 
Student: I t's great, man . I've nailed nine dudes. 

already-wait! (throws balloon) make that ten . (yells) 
the concrete, idiot! 

LB&CS : What is your motivation? 
Student : Well , I guess I am a pig . I'm interested in 

setting precedents, you know. Aside from all that, I 
guess I'm frustrated because my candidate didn't win . 

LB&CS : Oh? Who was that? 
Student : linda Jeness . 
LB&CS : I see . 

Student on sixth floor : 
LB&CS : Excuse me, sir. Could I speak to you for a 

moment? 
Student : (yelling) Argo , you' re beautifull Yeah, what 

do you want? 
LB&CS : You seem to be trying to stop this fight . Are 

you an RA? 
Student : Yes . 
LB&CS : Oh really? Which floor? 
Student: Not here. I n those other dorms. 
LB&CS : I see . I imagine you were called to help stop 

the waterfight. 

Th is week the Student 
Center Space Comm itteee 
will decide which student 
organizat ions ,will be 
housed in t he new 
University Center and 
which will be in 250 M .e. 
this year . 

This group, a sub-
committee of the Un-
dergraduate Student 
Council (TUSC), is com-
posed of students from all 
three colleges and from the 
Graduate Student Counci I. 
Before making any 
decisions, it will meet with 
all student organizations 
and discuss their needs with 
them . 

This space committee is 
advisory to the new 
University Center director, 
Mark Bookman . Bookman, 
a law student from UClA, 
will run the new University 
Center when it opens 
sometime in January. 

Over 70 student 
organizations have been 
sent letters requesting 
information as to their 
present and future space 
needs. In addition each 
organ iza tion has been 
scheduled to meet with the 
space comm ittee this week 
in the co nference room in 
building 250 on Mathews 
campus. 

All clu bs and 
organizations which do not 
receive this letter should 

,call Mark Bookman at 
x2943 in order to receive 
consideration . All clubs 
which do not respond to the 
letter or come to a meeting 

will not be allotted space . 
The committee faces a 

difficult task : deciding 
which of the 70 plus student 
organizations will be able 
to have space on campus. 
All cu rrent space i n 250 
M .e. will be re-allocated by 
the committee . Still, there 
will only be about 20 offices 
available for all 70 
organizations, (about eight 
in 250 M .e. and about 10 
new offices in the university 
center) . 

The following is a list of 
the times that organizations 
have been scheduled to 
meet with the space 
committee in the 250 M.c. 
conference room . If a club 
can not send a represen -
tative at the scheduled 
time, then students should 
call Mark Bookman, x2943, 
as soon as possible to 
arrange a better time. 

Those clubs which do not 
appear at the schedu led 
times and do not return the 
questionaire by Fr iday, 
November 16th, w ill not be 
elligible to receive space.

Student : No, not really . I just thought I'd come over 
and show the housing office what a good boy I am . 
There weren't any heads to crack at my hall , and (bei ng

came over here.

Christian Emphasis Week 
Offers Different Perspective 

LB&CS Note: We don't think it's funny . A girl was hurt 
and these RA's laugh , using her injury to gain favor for 
themselves . These RA's, we' re told, have a history of 
such actions . The story is told that not long ago a couple 
of people in one RA 's dorm were playing a stereo quite 
loud . in an effort to retaliate, a person in an adjoining 
dorm turned on his PA system-driven by a colossal one 
watt amplifier . True to form, the RA walked into the 
room of the person who owned the mammoth PA, 
grabbed the kazoo from the decadent musician who 
was playing "The Star Spangled Banner", and told him 
to kno c k it off . 

Such fairness should not go unnoticed , and we're sure 
it won't. However , we of the LB&CS staff feel that this

Exodus 
by Joan Garwood 

On the distant day, saddened by greetings, tired of all 
and new, elderly, thick, without a vision in sight, 
thinking of these times and no other, I left my close and 
sultry room with legs blackveined and trembling and 
went to the sea I say, to the sea and down, past all 
language and calamity and inspiration, past all suffering 
and joy in its many disguises, knowing each step a pa in 
each pain a step . Always to the sea I go as I go, la mer," 
to wait for the revelation . '. 

Before sinking deeper . ~ 
Soon it arrived, expanded, deriving form from the 

lamp of the moon . It found my si n, or so it thought, 
smiled agreeably, and said it is for your pride that you 
are damned, Miss, your pride and your intellectual 
vanity . You are disgraceful, defen seless, quite guilty. 
For infinity. 

I blushed , and those who had been looking for it, saw. 
-So why are you here? (It was relentless) . 
-For reason . 
-Good. Then you were ready to receive the truth . 
-I was offended by the truth. 
-Give me another . 
-I cannot . 
It prodded. 
-Then I say to you that I do not like your heavi ness. 

So close you stand . I do not like your breath that clings. 
When you touch me I crumble . I find nothing in you , no 
mirrorin your silver, slick image, no beat to follow in 
your chatter . You must be ... 1 insist you are not why ' 
have come. 

-You prevayle, and lose. 
-Was there a choice? 
-Almost. Now I go. 
And vanished quickly. 
I shivered in the nihilistic darkness, waiting, 

suspecting, prey to natural laws. Waves, laced golden 
and green yet grey, the color of grapes pulp, lapped 
gently against the shore , never still , moving, ordered 
and correct. I searched for flux, a flash or dagger, 
anything sharp or substantial, but found only disturbing 
peace, oppressive calm, a somethingness uncombative 
and unyeilding; a nothingness superior, victorious . The 
pines merely swayed in the breeze, empty of meaning or 
si gn, all flat , planar, smooth without ripp le or crinkle, 
formless and huge. I was ignored . 

Until sunrise . 
But now, on the distant night, a night of deter-

mination , each stick was a snake, every sound a war-
ning. I armed myself with heightened senses against this 
environment vaguely hostile wh ich chose to keep me 
beyond , alone . It was a test . There are no other tests 
than those we find when alone . It was a test. There are 
no other tests than those we find when alone with 
nature and forced to find meaning from the void, the 
wonder . To pass is to survive and as a further reward we 
grow stronger. we endure. With pride. This prj de is our 
grace, our defense, but yes ; in knowing pride we lose 
our innocense. I shall stay to discover if we are also 
damned. For infinity.

OPINION 
Open Letter 

To 
Congressman Wilson 

I '\n Open Letter To ongressman Wilson : For 20 years we've hard of presid ntial elect ion 
reform and have seen nothing. Now, we and the rest of 
the " Silent Majority" have no legal recourse with which 
to recall our votes of last year . Those ballots w re stolen 
from us, sir, by deceit, fraud and sabotage. 

We have lea rned that less than 3 weeks after his 
inauguration in 1969, Nixon enlarged the air war in 
Vietnam to inclu de Cambod ia . He had just narrowly 
won an election in wh ich he campaigned on 
deescalation. M oreover, he conducted this air war in 
secrecy from the Congress and the People of the United 
States . And you, sir, when these facts came out, what 
did you do? NOTHING! 

We have learned that the government has spen t 
millions of dollars refurbi shing Nixon's private 
residences. These residences were acquired under the 
shadi st of circumstances and are maintained by the 
government in spi te 01 the fact that the People have 
already provided a mansion and mountain re ort. Th (II rovernment A counting Office has con luded that j,ere has b en mi sappropriation of fund . And you, sir. 
what have you done? NOTHINC! 

W have seen Nixon r peatedly exercis what 
amounts to a budgetary line-item veto-a power on-
SplCUOU Iyab nt from the constitution-by impounding 
congr s ionally approved fu nds. You , sir, have b en 
chosen by us to decide how ou r taxes should b pent 
And wh at, si r, have you done in re ponse to the usur-
pation of your onstitutional powers? NOTHING! 

We have Nixon's own admission that he approveCl the 
Houston plan, a plan advocating bugging and burglary. 
The proposa l itself contained express statements to the 
effect that what it sought to implement was illegal. It's 
not only illegal , but in blatant violation of the Bill of 
Rights . Sir, we have fought wars for this Bill of Ri ghts. 
It's what 1776 was all about. Yet because he was candid , 
you exonerated him . Nixon admitted to the most 
heinous vio lation of the constitution and you, si r, did 
NOTHINGIII! 

We have watched the Senate Investigations on illegal 
campaign activities and the myriad related indictments 
and convictions for bribery, slander, wire-tapping, 
burglary, illegal corporate contributions, obstruction of 
justice and so on ad nauseam. Of cour e, what 's 
nauseating is to watch you and the rest of the snivelling. 
yellow-bellied cowards ignore the fact that the 1972 
election was a fraud. You have seen the entire fabri c of

In re pon to the "Bla k

"SATISFACTION"; In th 
Oct. 30 i su . 

I refu e to b I ieve that it 
was a BLACK WOMAN who 
actually wrote that letter. I 
think it wa probably some 
white chick trying to catch 
yet another BLACK 
BROTHER in her Beastly 
cl utches; That's all we need 
is another Nigger with a 
o vii Woman ! Bes ides, it is 
too hard for me to conceive 
of any Black Woman who 
has y t to b Satisfied by 
any Black Man . EspeCially, 
with all th ese Bloods 
around here! I'm afraid that 
I have more faith than that 
in my Black Broth ers . Yea, I 
figured it was some white 
woman or whit dud ven. 
who i trying to 
propagandize that Black 
People ar n't rea ll y uperior 
to whites in s x any more 
and t her fore, Amerika 
doe n't really need us to be 
th e "whore" because there 
ar mor than enough white 
people who ar unem-
ployed and can use the 
work and thu . the Black 
People shou ld be don

th I uropf'an . in luding

done to som 100 million 
Black African people over a

Don Maker 
last Friday I watched the San Diego Opera's rendition 

of Bizet's Carmen, wh ich was a fi ne technical 
production , but somewhat disappointing. in the per-
fo rmance. Â·Â· With few except ions the singing was 
uninspiring, and the performers did little to dispell the 
image of opera si ngers possessing almost no dramatic 
training. It was a good, professional show, but not up to 
the dynamic magnificence inherent in the music and 
libretto of Georges Bizet, and the quality wh ich the San 
Diego Opera is capable of attain ing. 

Ann Howard was competent as "Carmen", with a 
consistent musical performance. She was suitably 
seductive as the beautiful gypsy, but not terribly " fi ery" 
in the emoting department. 

William DuPre had his finest moment as " Don Jose" 
when he sang the lovely aria to Carmen telling of his 
love for her. Don Jose has been sent to t he stockade and 
demoted in rank for her sake, and a flower she gave him 
inspired him to endure the ordeal. DuPre acted well 
enough to make the scene believable, and showed the 
true power and range of his voice, bringing the 
audience to its feet with cheers and applause. 

But the surprising stand-out performer was Esther 
Hinds as " Michaela" . Ms. Hinds is a lovely young 
soprano with a tremendous vo ice, vibran t energy, and 
f ine acting talent. 

Maestro Walter Herbert, conducting the orchestra, 
absolutely overwhelmed the audience with a great 
presentation of Bizet's lovely score . The chorus was also 
excellent, adding harmony and color to a relatively 
lackluster staging, which is surprising considering that 
Will iam Roesch is one of the most respected stage 
directors in San Diego . 

For example, the principles were perm itted to use 
sloppy movement and stilted gestures, and the delivery 
of spoken lines seemed un important to a few per-
formers, particu larly Harold Enns as Lieutenant Zuniga, 
who dropped or stumbled over simple lines constan t ly. 
The few violent scenes were handled like grade school 
acting, with the cat-f ight between Carmen and another 
cigarette girl being a silly wrestl ing-dance, and the 
sword play between Don Jose and his superior being a 
childish banging of sticks. 

One of the finest parts of the show was t he set, which 
was somewhat innovative as well as creative. Terry 
Gates' set has been deservedly hailed by critics as a 
masterpiece, in which he demonstrated depths of 
imagination and artisti c fla ir, tempered with practical 
working space. Although the th ird set is written as a 
mountain pass, Gates makes his stalactite-ridden cave 
work very well for the mood of the scene. The 
costum ing, designed by Howard Bay, was also terriffic . 

The San Diego Opera will also be presenting The 
Marriage of Figaro beginning on November 28, The 
Rhine Gold, February 6, 1974, and Tosc:a, March 27, 
1974. It has been SRO so far th is season, so get your 
tickets early if you want to see name stars doing truly 
professional opera in San Diego.

"What you did was wholv rotten, 

What you are is all unshriven .. " 

Rosa lind Erskine, from The Passion Flower Hotel 

Rotten and unshriven is the w~y I feel while reading 
prophecy, Myrna Bercovic i's collection o f photographs 
and Old Testament quotations. Neither the photograph~ 
nor the words are Myrna's , but a heavy load of guilt is, 
and she's going to share it with the rest of us Lest our 
thoughts turn too frivolously to our own problems we 
are reminded that all over the world people are starving 
and dying and being murdered, babies are being 
slaughtered, cities are strangling In polution , AND GOD 
TOLD US SO! The message may be noble, but the 
medium is mediocre. 

PROPHECY is neither the fi rst book of its kind nor 
probably even the sixteenth . Collect ions of photog;aphs 
Interspersed with thought-provoki ng quotations have 
been done before. Since they are nearly all much the 
same, it is difficult to say whether Myrna's is better or 
worse t han the others. The message is always the same: 
Man is rotten. 

I'm sure we all do need to be rem inded of the suf-
ferings of our fellow-man from t ime to time, but it 
seems that the format could be changed occasionally . A 
message that is simply repeated ad nauseum ceases to 
be listened to .

Basketball Team. By Ki r,k Robinson 

AlA Opener 
The UCSD varsity basketball team begins its season 

this Wednesday against Athletes in Action, a group of 
ex-co llege basketball players. 

Leading the Tritons again this year will be Paul 
Train.er, an all District III selection at center last year . 
Backing up Trainer on the front line will be Joe Coit, a 
transfer student from Riverside CC and Steve Higgins 
also returning from last year's team. ' 

In the backcourt the Tritons are lead by George 
Calhoun, also a transfer student from Riverside. Mark 
Read and AI Clark both up from last years frosh team 
also figure to see a lot of action in the backcourt. 

This years team is small, but has good speed and 
hustle. T? take advantage of the speed Coach Bill 
Reeves will employ a fast break offense with a pressing 
defense. Reeves is looking ahead to a succesful season 
for the Tritons . . 

Soccer Team Loses 
Tiebreaker to Fresno 
The game that was billed 

as UCSD's game of the year 
came out exactly that . One 
of the strangest games in 
this school's history, the 
Triton Soccer Team lost its 
chance to represent this 
region in the NAIA 
Championships in Missouri . 
Origi nally sched u led to 
start and end on Thursday, 
this game was such a 
defensive battle that it was 
called on the accou nt of 
darkness after two and a 
half hours of play, with the 
score tied 1-1. 

This game was then 
fi ni shed Friday with a 
penalty kick tie breaker, 
which was won by Fresno 
Pacific, 2-1. 

Both goals came early in 
the game, UCSD .drawing 
first blood on a goal scored 
by Philippf' Vivaco with a 

head shot off of a throw in 
from Brad Peryr . Fresno 
quickly retaliated and 
scored its lone goal on a 
penalty kick put into the 
nets by Carlos . 

The game then settled 
into the defensive duel that 
it was, as neither ' team 
could push the ball into the 
of'lPosi ng team 's goal. 

The next day, it was 
arranged that the kicking 
duel would decide the 
game, since some of the 
Fresno players had to go 
back to Fresno (where 
else?). 

The kick-off consisted of 
five players from each team 
taking penalty kicks at the 
opposing goa lie . With 
UCSD winning the toss to 
decide who would decide 
who would kick first

I have promised myself that just before I die I will think 
of Beth.)

Student: Wait . (grunts and groans) Okay. I just had to 

loosen my jock strap so I could talk. 
Yes, I was outraged . When I came to the Big U, I 

expected an Utopia. Instead, I found all these naive pigs 
trying to have fun . 

There was light once again. I waited for recognition

were cooked at diHerent temperatures, Daddy's plum.

Open Letter 

LB&CS : Pigs having fun? Are you sure? 
Student : I can even give you a more recent example 

than the watert ight . Why, just the other night these 
same pigs were going around Argo turning off all the 

I~ghts! Of course, we can't allow these things to con-
tinue. 

LB&CS : What would you suggest the pigs do to relieve 
their tensions? 

Students : Well , anything we don't have to bust 'em 
for . Smoke grass, maybe. Instead of paying a ten dollar 
fine for throwing a balloon, they could buy an ounce of 
marijuana. A few drags on a joint or a few bites of a 
brownie and everything's cool. The authorities don't 
seem so oppressive anymore, you knowl 

'Cause when you're like that , you're cool. And when 
you're cool, you're on your way to being mature. 

Student : Sure it is . I mean, all the mature people are 
right? / 

NOTICE 
Would the student who 

got up and spoke at the La 
lolla Town Council meeting 
a week ago Thursday about 
UCSD community feelings 
toward the proposed Town 
Center please contact Betsy 
Moll at x-2184 Immediately. 
Your help IS needed for an

issue with the Town
