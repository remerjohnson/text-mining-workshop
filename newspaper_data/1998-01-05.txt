LOS ANGELES -
According to a document 
obtained by The Daily Trojan, 
several classes last semester 
enrolled an unusually high 
number of athletes, in some 
cases more than 40 percent. 
For example, of the 35 stu-
dents who enrolled in 
Sociology 33 1, 15 students -
43 percent - were athletes. 
The allegations were made in 
a memo sent by Christopher 
Caimey, director of learning 
support at Student Athlete 
Academic Services, to the 
athletic oversight committee 
on Sept. 2. "In certain courses 
in the current semester, class-
es are' loaded ' with student 
athletes," Caimey stated in 
the memo. The athletic over-
sight committee was created 
in spring 1996 to make ure 
the univers ity remained in 
compliance with Pacific 10 
Conference and NCAA regu-
lations.

Race a Main Factor 
in Unemployment 
BERKELEY - A recently 
released UC Berkeley study 
found that race is the dominant 
factor in high unemployment 
rates in African-American 
communities in the Bay Area. 
Robert Cervero, a professor of 
city and regional planning, co-
authored the report with two 
UC Berkeley graduate stu-
dents. The study examined fac-
tors such as phy ica1 accessi-
bility to jobs and education 
levels in African-American 
communities. Cervero con-
cluded that while physical iso-
lation and lack of education 
are the most commonly cited 
causes. of higher unemploy-
ment rates for African 
Americans, these factors are 
responsible for only 42 percent 
of African-American unem-
ployment. He stated in the 
report that race is respon ible 
for 52 percent. Cervero looked 
at employment access in nine 
Bay Area counties between 
1980 and 1990.

Grapes to Return to 
Harvard University 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -
Harvard University's dining 
halls will soon be stocked 
with grapes, thanks to the 
majority of undergraduates 
who voted to discontinue 
Harvard Dining Sen'ice ' 
(HDS) boycott on grapes. Of 
the 3,166 students who voted , 
1,694 students voted in favor 
of returning grapes to the din-
ing halls, while 1,472 voted 
again t the referendum. About 
50 percent of the undergradu-
ate population voted on the 
referendum. The turnout for 
last year ' Undergraduate 
Council pre idential election 
was 43 percent. Alexandra E. 
McNitt, project manager for 
HDS, said that grapes will 
probably not be available to 
student on a daily ba is 
because ·'they don ' t lend 
them elve to be a grab-and-
go fruit like orange, apples 
or bananas. "

tunning Victory A.S. Council 
Begins New 
Quarter 
P~LICY: Representatives 
amend election bylaws and 
debate merit of UCSA Agenda 
By Erika Snide, 
Staff Writer 

After a quarter filled with issues and contro-
versies, the A.S. Council will once again meet 
this week to commence yet another session. 

The main issue that dominated the council 's 
work during the fall quarter was the approval of 
the University of California Student 
Association (UCSA) Advocacy Agenda. 

The controversy surrounding this plan, 
which featured six points the UCSA planned to 
focus on this year, centered on supporting stu-
dent immigrants and the unionization ofTAs. 

Some A.S. council members expressed con-
cern that approval of these areas of the plan 
would be seen by the UCSA as consent to sup-
port or protest other topics, such as Proposition 
209 and border control. Some council members 
did not feel such issues were appropriate for 
UCSA to address. 

Additionally, some A.S. members, such as 
A.S . President. Souley Diallo, sa id they 
believed that the unionization of TAs was an 
issue for graduate students to address, not 
undergraduates.

Backers of the agenda criticized these fears, 
stating that the UCSA is accountable to all UC 
students , including graduate students and 
immigrants. In the end, the plan was approved 
by the counci l 15 to 5 with three abstentions.

By Christine VeI.rde 
St8ff Writer 

Noel Riley Fitch, the author of

Julia Child, the only authorized 
biography of Julia Child, spoke at 
UCSD on Dec. 5. Fitch talked 
about her new book and of her 
experiences writing the book. 

her personal records, including 
childhood diaries, letters, c1ippiogs 
and photographs. 

Over a period of five years, 
Fitch conducted 400 interviews 
with Child's family, friends and 
those who had worked with her. 
Fitch also found government docu-
ments on Child. 

Fitch is a historical biographer 
who holds a Ph.D. in Literature. 

Child was born in 1912 in 

Her previous works 
include Sylvia 
Beach and the Lost 
Generation (1983) 
and Anais: The 
Erotic Life oj Anais 
Nin (1993). Her 
biography of Child 
was her first one of

Fitch said her 
personal admira-
tion of Child made 
it difficult to be an 
unbiased biograph-
er.

that her California 
history had an 
influence on 
Child's life. 

"Her openness 
and optimism 
probably had 
something to do 
with her 
California intlu-
ence," Fitch said. 
"She is always 
upbeat." 

Child has a

Fitch also said it was much eas-

ier to write about someone living 
because she could ask her subject 
questions. 

Fitch has written about the con-
nection between France and 
America for the past 20 years, 
focusing on literary subjects such 
as Ernest Hemingway. 

According to Fitch, writing 
about Child kept with her French-
American tradition. "but was a 
diversion into the culinary world." 

Child turned down several biog-
raphers, but agreed to let Fitch 
write her biography. According . to 
Fitch. Child has read Lost 
GtMrarion, and knew of Fitch's 
passion for France. In addition, 
Child knew Fitch and her husband 
for several years before Fitch 
began writing. 

"I guess she must have trusted 
me," Fitch said. 

Child granted Fitch access to 

Child and her husband lived in 
Provence, France, for 30 years. She 
mas'tered the art of French cooking 
during this time. 

Child spent 10 years working on 
her tirst book, a cookbook that rev-
olutionized the American attitude 
toward food and cooking. 

"Before. food came out of tin 
cans, and fresh produce was rare," 
Fitch said. "Julia's book revolu-
tionized the way even restaurants 
thought about food." 

After the first cookbook, Child 
continued to educate Americans 
about French cooking through tele-
vision appearances and new cook-
books. 

Fitch commented that Child did 
not achieve her fame until liter in 
her life. 

"Julia had an exciting life and 
lived a lot before becoming 
famous," Fitch said. "Her story had 
to be told." 

The 10th campus in the University of California sys-
tem will be called UC Merced. Carol Tomlinsol)-Keasey, 
uC's vice provost for academic initiatives, made the for-
mal announcement last month at a ceremony at the 
Merced County Courthouse Museum. The announce-
ment came in the form of a letter from UC President 
Richard Atkinson to the UC Board of Regents. 

The name of the new campus has remained 
unclear for several years while the university conduct· 
ed an elaborate site selection process in central 
California. During that time, UC officials assigned the 
campus the generic title ·UC San Joaquin: 

In May 1995, the future campus site was chosen 
to be near Lake Yosemite In the Sierra Nevada 
foothills five miles northeast of Merced. However, the 
campus was never given an official name. 

UC Merced Is scheduled to open Its doors to Its 
first students In 2005.

UC Eligibility Proposal Sparks 
Statewide Controversy 
PLAN: 12.5 percent 
from each high school 
would be admitted 
By Ellen Lee 
Daily Californian (U·WIRE) 

BERKELEY - In the scramble 
to maintai n di versity in Cali forn ia's 
public un iversi ties, Sen . Teresa 
Hughes (D-Inglewood) has drafted 
a bold ini tiati ve to al ter the 
Californ ia Master Plan for Higher 
Education. 

For the last 15 years, the top 
12.5 percent of public high school 
graduates have been admitted to at 
least one of the 12 UC schools. 
With the in itiati ve. this would 
change . 

Hughes said that her proposal 
would even out the play ing fie ld 
by admi tt ing the top 12.5 percent 
of each high school's graduati ng 
class. Stude nts wo uld co mpete 
with thei r peers, who have the 
same resources and restraints as 
the )' do. 

But the proposa l, scheduled for 
re"lCW by the state Senate in 
la,.uary, come with some unre-
so.ved issues. 

" I don't know enough to be 
able to answer [whether I'm for or 
aga:nst itl." said Bob Laird. direc-
tor of admi:sions at UC Berkeley. 

Laird added that he is waiting 
to hear from research studies 
before draw ing any concl usions. 

"What criteria would be used to 

determine the top 12.5 percent?" 
Laird asked. "How would the out-
come change under the proposal as 
compared to the resul ts we had last 
year? How would we look a: indi-
vidual high schools?" 

cants, UC schools accepted more 
than 90 percent of them - 78 stu-
dents.

Ca li fornia's high schools pose dif-
lieu !ties, as well. According to 
Street, Piedmont High School stu-
dents have a choice of taking eight 

Around the Bay Area, high 
school officials are questioning 
whether or not the 
proposal is fa ir. 

Karen Street, a 
counselor at 
Piedmont High 
School, said she 
believes that 
Hughes' proposal 
is not fai r. 

" I disapprove," 
Street said. who has 
worked as a coun-
se lor fo r 12 years. 
" It would be highly 
negative for our 
students. We use 
the A-F req uire-
ments [that UC 
schools provide 1 as 
tools and guidelines 
for our students. At 
Piedmont. the 
majority of the stu-
dents arc UC-el igi-
ble." 

"Every school 
district has 
different 
standards and I 
believe the 
proposal will 
lower the 
standards at UC 
[schools]. If the 
top 12.5 percent 
meet the college 
entrance 
requirements, 
then I would be 
in favor of It."

and two honors 
classes, whereas 
some other high 
schools only offer 
two Advanced 
Placement courses. 

In addition, the 
competi tiveness of 
the students at 
Piedmont High 
School could li mit 
the number of stu-
dents there who 
eventuall y decide 
to enroll at a UC. 

"What if the

seniors - a little more than 50 per-
cent - applied to one or more of 
the UC schools. Of those appli-

asked. "What happens to the stu-
dents in the next tier? Where do

Associated Student Council Report Card 

The 

By Jessyca Wallace 
Associa te Opinion Editor 

WiLh the arrival of the new year, the 
time has come for us to look around, 
take st.ock and change -anything with 
which we are not satisfied. One place to 
begin such an endeavor is our student 
government, Lhe Associated Students 
(A.S.) Council. 

The A.S. Council - for Lhose of 
you who remain uninformed - is com-
prised of student-elected officials and 
appointed officials who convene week-
ly to discuss current issues at UCSD, 
fund student organizations and general-
ly serve the student body. 

The A.S. council operates on two 
major levels. First, it function as a self-

Internally, Vice President 
Administrative David Fitzgerald has 
managed to keep council meetings -
which have historically run four to six 
hours - regularly under Lhree hours 
and most often, under two. The council 
also has a representative on each of Lhe 
Campus Wide Committees, thanks to 
Fitzgerald. 

The executives have revamped baLh 
the council and financial bylaws to 
lessen bureaucracy and ease student 
organization funding. In an effort to be 
fair to all student organizations, Vice 
President of Finance Tony Fiori insti-
tuted a strict adherence to Lhe Student 
Organization Funding Board (SOFAB) 
regulations and 30-minute seminars on 

contained organiza-
tion with its own 
hierarchy, bureau-
cracy and problems 
Lhat relate only to Lhe 
body of council 
members. Second, it 
functions as a ser-
vant to the students, 
and as Lhe liaison 
between Lhe students 
and the administra-
tion. 

Financially, student

thankful that this

funding for student 
organizations. 

One area in 
which Lhe council 
fails to improve is 
public relations. 
The A.S. council 
has been wiLhout an 
effective director of 
public relations 
since the get-go and 
currenUy lacks one 
altogether. The most impor-

tant aspect about this 
split in operation is 
that each part is 
nothing wiLhout the 

year'. council used a 
little forethought In 
doling out the money. 
Ther. Is plenty left to 
take all student 
organizations through 
spring quarter, 
something that rarely 
happens. 

AnoLher area 
that could stand 
some progress is 
the External Office. 

oLher, and baLh are essential - much 
like how Lhe faculty would not have 
jobs without the students, yet students 
would not attend a university wiLhout 
faculty. Those seeking to evaluate orga-
nizations like Lhe A.S. often overlook 
Lhis little tidbit of information. 

Some wish Lhe A.S. would only help 
students and all Lheir money would go 
to student organizat.ions and TGlFs. 
But if Lhe council members are not 
paid, there is little incentive to consis-
tently do their job well . 

Now, with the operational structure 
in mind, it is time to examine the coun-
ci l itself, first on Lhe internal level , Lhen 
on the external level. 

It seems Lhat Lhis year's A.S. council 
is running smooLhly, working hard and 
nol disappointing too many students. 
This council is by far the most UCSD-
oriented council of the last three years. 
While exhibiting some concern for sy -
temwide, city and community issues, 
Lhi council works hard to make UCSD 
a better place. 

In Lhe past, Lhis office actively fought 
for minon'ty rights and was heavily 
influenced by the University of 
California Student Association 
(UCSA). AILhough we used to wish the 
office would take notice of local affairs 
and improve outreach, we currently 
would like to see some work coming 
out of this office. 

Overall, though, Lhe senators are 
busy wiLh Lheir projects and committee 
meetings, ~ave good attendance at 
council meetings and seem to be 
involved. The commissioners are doing 
their jobs and the executives are always 
hard at work. Council running smooLh-
ly and efficiently is a necessary founda-
tion for providing benefits to students. 
This suggests Lhat the rest of the term 
will only get better. 

The external level of operation 
influences the student experience at 
UCSD. A big concern is school spirit 
and panicipation. According to Lhe A.S. 
Advocacy Agenda, which was assem-

FAIR COVERAGE WANTED Sensitive, Affordable Dental Care Editor: 
In regard to Lhe Dec. I article by 

Jonah Freedman titled, "Guardian 
Offers Cease-Fire to Greek 
System," I am very enLhused. Three 
cheers to Freedman for making an 
honest attempt to repair Lhe rela-
tionship between Lhe UCSD Greek 
system and Lhe Guardian There is 
much work to do, but his effort is 
truly appreciated by the Greek sys-
tem . 

I'm not really sure wiLh whom 
he has spoken, but I am ' sorry that 
he got the impression Lhat Greeks 
thought recent articles were slanted 
or were upsct Lhat Lhe articles ran. I 
would like to remind him Lhat in 
journali sm, you are bound to get 
some flack. 

The Greek system is Lhe largest 
student organization on campus 
and consists of approximately 
1,000 members. If something is 
wrong, you will hear about it. 

I thought that the articles 
regarding the happenings between 
the Interfraternity Counci l, Delta 
Sigma Phi and Sigma Alphi\ 
Epsi lon were quite fair. They 
reported and mediated news to the 
community. I have noth ing I could 
really complain about. 

In fact, I agree that thfJ, article 
showed that the Greek System w"s 
taking care of itself regarding the 
two fraternities. I also appreciate 
Freedman's personal kudos to the 
Panhellenic Association's decision 
regarding the two fraternities, as 
well as all the positive press af)<)ut 
the Greek System that the 
Guardian has published in the paSl 
few months. 

Howevcr, I'm not writing Lhi s 
letter just to thank you for the past 
few Greek-related articles. What I 
ask of Lhe Guardian is simple -
consistency. 

It was only last April whl~n 
Grace Jang wrote an unfounded, 
uneducated and clearly biased arti-
cle titled, "UCSD Should Keep an 
Eye on Greek Slate." As my mem-
ory recalls, Lhere were so many 
negative stereotypes crafted into 
that piece that ] wouldn't even 
know where to begin correcting her 
on all of her misconceptions. 

This past September, the 
Interfraternity Counci l, the 
Pan hell enic Association and

Intercollegiate ALhletics sponsored 
a pre-game barbecue at a men's 
waterpolo game. The purpose 
behind the barbecue was to get 
people out to Lhe game and pass out 
information on the Greek System. 

The Guardian reported that the 
barbecue was a huge success and 
added a few words ' about how 
shocked it was Lhat Lhe Greeks were 
involved. A mere two sentences is 
really not much when you put on 
the event. Could the Greek system 
and Intercollegiate Athlet.ics be a 
formula for school spirit? Who 
knew? 

I take note of Freedman's com-
ments about stereotypes of the 
Greek system. I know they exist 
and I understand Lhere are people 
who are going to dislike Lhe Greek 
system for whatever reasons. But 
I'm disheartened when I see Lhat 
sentiment coming from Lhe school 
newspaper, as in the articles stated 
above. Maybe it is not overt, but it 
is Lhcre. 

I've got news for you - what is 
written in the Guardian, good or 
bad, does matter. Maybe those who 
disliki.: the Greek system will keep 
on believing what Lhey want to 
believe, but a lot of people just 
don't have an opinion eiLher way. 
So when anti-Greek sentiment is 
evident in the supposedly unbiased 

school newspaper, what does Lhat 
say to people who have no opinion 
either way? 

Here is what I ask of the 
Guardian. Be consistent. I under-
stand Lhat as the school newspaper, 
you are going to cover Greek-relat-
ed events, and I'm all for Lhat. But 
please, if you're going to try to be 
unbiased, then be consistently 
unbiased. 

I've been here four years and 
I've seen many sides to the 
Guardian, pretty much both ends 
of the spectrum. I like Lhe recent 
unbiased perspective toward the 
Greek system, but I want it to last. 
I expect Lhat from my school news-
paper. 

What I'd like to hope for is that 
even after Freedman has stopped 
writing for Lhe Guardian, even after 
he has left UCSD, Lhe Guardian 
will still remain unbiased toward 
Greeks. In fact, it shouldn't matter 
who is writing Lhe article. I truly do 
appreciate your article Freedman 
- and it is a step in Lhe right direc-
tion - but action speaks louder 
Lhan words and I'm still looking.

LEIIERS: 
Affirmative action 
furthers racism 
Continued from paee 5 
tive action, minorities are at a 
clear disadvantage in every walk 
of life. While he is ab olutely 
right, he does not consider that 
affirmative action will prevent 
minorities from ever shedding 
that di sadvantage. 

For four years I attend('d La 
Jolla High School, during which 
time one of the school's vice prin-
cipals was a black woman. Most 
students never had a reason to say 
a word to her, and subsequently 
knew nothing about her other than 
her appearance. I had one brief 
encounter with this vice principal, 
and found her to be intelligent and 
well-spoken. 

Though none of my classmates 
had reason to have developed a 

contrasting opinion, there was a 
seldom-voiced, yet ever-present 
,assumption that she had attained 
her position due to affirmative 
action. _ 

My contemporaries' mention of 
her, however rare, almost always 
included a reference to the prefer-
ential treatment which everyone 
assumed she had received. 

This is what affirmative action 
has created. It was an essential 
program when it was introduced 
over 30 years ago. However, our 
socie ty has now reached the point 
where the continued progression 
of race relations requires that affir-
mative action be abolished. 

Is there a level playing field? Of 
course noL Nevertheless, if we are 
to move further in that direction, a 
16-year-old boy from La Jolla must 
be allowed to accept that a black 
woman can reach a distinguished 
position in society on her merits 
alone. Affirmative action denies

Media Misdirects 
Teens to 1IoI5afe" Sex 
Editor: 

In Tabitha Granshaw's Dec. I 
article, "UCSD Marks World AIDS 
Day With Panel Discussion," Eliza 
Soba is quoted as saying, "I really 
believe that very few people actual-
ly think of themselves as at risk." I 
agree with her. Furthermore, I 
myself am one of those people who 
considers himself not to be at risk, 
because I have a complete immuni-
ty to HIV. 

I am writing because, after read-
ing about AIDS Day, I have read 
nothing about how to protect one-
self completely from AIDS. I am 
not referring to the use of condoms 
and so forth. Reducing the risk of 
AIDS is not the same as eliminat-

ing it. I am referring to the one way 
a person can entirely protect them-
selves from ever being at even the 
slightest risk for AIDS . 

Do not have extramarital sex and 
do not use illegal IV drugs. It seems 
to me that very few people here at 
UCSD do the latter - this is a good 
step. However, everywhere I look, 
the emphasis seems to be on "safe 
sex." This does not eliminate the 
risk of AIDS or other STDs. If you 
want to really protect yourself from 
HN, try "no sex." Anyone who does 
this will be effectively immunized 
against virtually all STDs. 

I leave it to the reader to decide 
whether or not immunity from 
AIDS, along with no risk of 
unwanted pregnancy and perhaps 
a clean conscience, is worth the 
cost of abstinence. But, if you go 
ahead, take your chances with sex, 
and lose, please understand that it 
is your own fault.

UPDATE: 
A,S, future is 
looking brighter 
ContInued from pq. 4 
bled and released last quarter, the 
A.S . council is interested in 
improving school spirit and unity. 

On the road to progress, A.S_ is 
working with Triton Cheer to sup-
plement its incentive program to 
provide students with athletic 
events. A newsletter will soon be 
sent to all student organizations, 
including a monthly calendar of 
events. A.S. avidly supports the 
move of our athletic teams to 
Division II and has set up an A.S_ 
web-page to reach more students. 
The address of this page is 
hup://sdcc3.ucsd.edu/-asucsd. 

Entertainment is another area of 
concern for students. Programmer 
Kathy Lee is working with the 
council to provide the best year 
ever of TGlFs, concerts and festi-
vals. Winterfest promises to be an 
excellent show with a really big-
name band. She brought Buck-O-
Nine .to a TGW and continues to 
provide that stellar beer garden. 
Also, the council is collecting 
funds from local businesses to 
make this year's upcoming Sun 
God Festival the best ever. 

Financially, student organiza-
tions can be thankful that this 
year's council used a little fore-
thought in doling out the money. 
There is plenty left to take all stu-
dent organizations through spring 
quarter, something that rarely hap-
pens. Also, council is working to 
expand A.S. Lecture Notes, the Co-
ops are doing well and this year's 
finance office constructed a long-
term fiscal plan to ensure future 
A.S. financial security. 

The A.S. could improve by 
more effective dispersal of infor-
mation about events and issues. 
Council should not rely solely on 
Synergy and the weak Authorized 
Propaganda. The A.S. should issue 
press releases to the Guardian 
because it is more widely read than 
any other campus publication. 

All in all, the 1997~ 1998 A.S. 
Council is doing much to improve 
student life, and it deserves a pat on 
the back. We expect this level of 
energy and productivity to continue 
through winter and spring quarters.

The plan also calls for the reno-
vation of Rupertus Way, the road 
that will lead into the garage. 
Borsa said that the renovations 
will help visitors find their way to 
popular campus locations such as 
the library and the Price Center. 

The new structure does not 
come without cost. UCSD com-
munity members that purchase 
parking permits will be required to 
foot the bill. 

The price of a parking permit 
will increase gradually over a peri-
od of three years. By Fall 2000, an 
"S," or student, permit will cost 
$360 a year, a "B," or graduate stu-
dent and staff and faculty, permit 
will cost $477 a year and an "A," 
or staff and faculty, permit will 
cost $540 a year. Presently, an "s" 
permit costs $272.25, a "B" permit 
costs $355.50 and an "A" permit 
costs $405. 

According to John Desch, a

the next step will be to design the 
garage. Once this is completed and 
existing facilities on the lot have 
been relocated, construction can 
begin. 

Two years ago, Transportation 
and Parking Services and 
Campus Planning issued a report 
entitled Transportation and 
Parking at UCSD, 1995-96 to 
2005-06. The report outlined dif-
ficulties in parking space avail-
ability and proposed measures to 
resolve such problems. Parking 
structures were one of the pro-
posed measures. 

The report highlighted five pos-
sible locations in the University 
Center area for a parking structure 
- three sites were for above 
ground structures and two were 
below ground. 

Borsa said the proposed under-
ground structures would have cost 
much more than their above-
ground counterparts. 

In addition, Borsa said that an 
underground structure would 
necessitate a building to be placed 
on top of the structure.

In addition to the work sur-
rounding the Advocacy Agenda, 
the A.S. council ' also opted to 
change UCSD election bylaws.

members chose to end runoff elec-
tions. Proponents of the change

Council members voted against 
a proposal that would limit slates 
to presidential and v icc-pre iden-
tial candidates. or a group of sena-
torial candidates from a spc ilic 
college. 

Instead. the current system. 
which allows candidates running

resources in order to run a cam-
paign together, will remain intact. 

The fi nal election bylaw 
change made in October addressed 
the loca tion of polling pl aces 
across campus. In accordance with 
this change. polling places for 
elections will now be located in 
the areas in every college where 
there will more likely be a higher 
turnout of voters. Behind this 
change is the hope that more stu-
dents will vote in the annual A.S. 
elections. 

During the fall quarter, the A.S. 
Council renewed its financial con-

the council voted. 22 to zero with 
one abstention, to continue "over-

'With this approval, the A.S.

begin meeting in the winter quarter 
to decide whether the co-ops will 
be forced to submit an audit of 
their business or a less intensive 
financial review to the A.S. after

"These issues have always been 
ci rculating in the A.S. as long as 
I've been on theA.S .... Diallo said. 
"Now we are trying to get these 
issues resol ved." 

Diallo said that he expects a 
number of other matters to be 
looked into by the A.S . this winter 
quarter. Diallo mentioned that 
there will be more changes in the 
structure of the A.S. with potential 
modifications in the counci l 
bylaws. 

Additionally, Diallo anticipates 
more discussion a.cd work on the

Features Associate Editor 
Something to 
Consider This Year 

I have never been one to commit 
to resolutions for improving 
myself. 

It is not cynicism but skepticism 
that disillusions me from this annu-
altradition. The benefits are lost on 
me because my view is that if you 
know you have a problem with 
weight, attitude. dress or social 
habits. then just fix it as soon as 
you can. 

Statistics show that very few 
people who make resolutions are 
able to stick to them for any signif-
icant amount of time. To me, reso-
lutions have always seemed like a 
way for people to identify a prob-
lem. establish a viable solution and 
then push it aside because. after all . 
no one keeps his or New Year's res-
olutions anyway. 

Besides, New Year's resolu-
tions are for suckers. Who needs 
to make a bunch of self-made 
promises at the beginning of 
every year that they have neither 
the intention of keeping, flor the 
will power to maintain? If you 
ha ve a problem. fix it. If you 
can 't, then don 't beat yourself up 
over it. and instead find another 
way to make amends. 

However, having said that. there 
are some things thatl think every-
one should consider. 

To start off, let me just say that 
as far as years arc concerned, ) 997 
did not rock my world. In the last 
quarter alone, my car has been bro-
ken into (twice). and my apartment 
has visited by the police (twice), 
fire and medical emergency ser-
vices (twice). and animal control 
(for a boa constrictor!). 

But, ) remain optimistic for the 
new year. The fact that J will not 
make any resolutions for this year 
means that my tendency to procras-
tinate -or the fact that I rarely do 
my dishes more than once a week 
- will remain unchanged. 

I do feel . though, that there are a 
few things that I need to consider 
to improve the chances for a suc-
cessful 1998. 

This year. rather than focus on 
the little things. I decided to step 
back and reflect on the bigger pic-
ture. Rather than worry about petty 
concems. I want to address the 
larger problem of overall attitude. 
So here are a few considerations 
anyone can make when living their 
life. 

Resolve 10 recognize other ptO-
pie's Iwrdships. 

1be nonnal troubles associated 
with living should not be a compe-
tition. Regardless of how badly you 
have had it, recognize that other 
people have faced adversity. too. 
Even if your situation is worse, 
there is no need to detract from 
their tirade to continually vent your 
own problems. In recognizing the 
tribulations of others. perhaps you 
will come to further appreciate 
your own bles ing .

Ubraries Reduce Expenses 
By Terry Lew 

In FebrujlfY, University Librarian Gerald Lowell announced his 
plan to save $406.000 per year without layoffs or serious reductions in 
services. ending months of speculation on the fate of the Geisel 
Library's infonnation and reference desks. 

Lowell plans to realize the savings by eliminating eight positions 
and by subsequently reassigning 10 staff members to different posts 
within the libraries. 

"This is the first time the library has ever conducted a major pro-
grammatic reduction," Lowell said. "We were very fortunate to be able 
to do this without layoffs." 

Although the changes will be mostly unnoticeable to library patrons, 
the reductions in service have been essentially ongoing since November 
1995, when Lowell instituted a hiring freeze to maintain open positions 
for employees whose jobs might be eliminated.

UCSD Wins $30 Million NSF 
Supercomputing Grant 
By Terry Lew 

In March, the National Science Foundation (NSF) announced that 
UCSD will lead one of the two groups working to revolutionize high-per-
fonnance computing. 

UCSD's National Partnership for Advanced Computational 
Infrastructure (NPACI) was awarded one of two NSF Partnerships for 
Advanced Computational Infrastructure (PAO) granrs intended to foster 
research into superfast networking hardware and software. 

Chancellor Robert Dynes said that the five-year NSF contract itself, 
with the potential for a five-year extension, is wonh more than $30 mil-
lion. He added that the contract's true value, though. will likely be twice 
that because of outside research funding. 

NPACI brings together 37 leading academic and research institutions 
including eight of the nine UC campuses, and three national laboratories 
managed by the university. 

PAC] is the successor to the NSF's current supercomputer center pr0-
gram, which began in 1985 with four centers: the San Diego 
Supercomputer Center. the National Center for Supercomputing 
Applications at the University of llIinois at Urbana-Champaign. the 
Cornell Theory Center and'"the Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center.

APRIL 14 
Diallo Elected President By 
35 Percent Margin 
By JulJ. KuI~r MIl Rpn Olson 

The "Revolution" slate reigned supreme in April's A.S. elections, 
despite fewer than 20 percent of UCSO's 14,623 undergraduates -
2,667 - turning out to vote. 

Voters elected Souley DiaIIo, from the Revolution slate, to the A.S, 
presidency. Diallo received 52.5 percent of the 2J71 votes cast in the race, 

"Students First!" candidate Alex T_ Tom received 38.9 percent of 
the vote and unaffiliated candidate Aamir Raza carried 8.7 percent 

''I'm very honored that the students have selected me as the next 
A.S. President," Diallo said. "I'm very happy that our slate did well; 
we're looking forward to this house of governing." 

In addition to selecting next year's council, studenrs voted on sev-
eral referenda_ The proposed constitutional amendrnenrs, which sim-
plify the current document, passed with 74.4 percent of the vote, The 
referenda needed a two-thirds majority vote to carry. 

Students overwhelmingly - 87.4 percent - supported the non-
binding referendum intended to detennine students' opinion of a move 
to NCAA Division II. 

The two-fee referenda on the ballot - a 7()..cent-per-quarter " lock-
in" fee for UC and U.S. Student Association due and a $4 per quarter 
ports fee - failed to gamer the required two-thirds majority vote.

Resolve to fully utilize the

Philippines President Ramos 
Discusses Future at (RIPS 
By Terry Lew 

.-S 
Faculty Rejects School 
Proposal 
By Jull. Kull~1der 

FEA1lJRES II 

After years of planning, months of deliberation and weeks of impas-
sioned debate, the UCSD faculty voted against Thurgood Marshali 
College Provost Cecil Lytle's proposed charter high school. 

The original goal of the proposed UCSD Charter High School was 
to take ninth graders who had no intentions of going to college and to 
make them competitively eligible for the University of California and 
other top-tier schools. 

.' 

Philippines President Fidel Ramos swept through Southern 
California last May, stopping on campus to receive UCSD's highest 
honor - the UCSD Medal. 

The campus medal is the University of Cali fomi a's equivalent to an 
honorary degree. Intended to recognize individuals who have made 
"significant contributions in their public and professional Jives," the 
UCSD Medal has been awarded seven times in the university's history 
to visiting heads of state and other dignitaries. 

The Charter School Steering Committee, chaired by Thurgood . ' 
Marshall Provost Cecil Lytle, lobbied for a 9-12 high school located on 
the UCSD campus. Ideally, students enrolled in the school would be 
underachieving, high-potential youth from San Diegos economically-
depressed communities. 

Chancellor Robert Dynes presented the medal to Ramos in a cere-
mony at the Graduate School of International Relations/Pacific Studies 
courtyard. 

"With his clear vision of the future and hand -on style, President 
Ramos has brought order, optimism and renewed vitality to the 
Philippines," Dynes said , 

Ramos spoke about the Philippines' economic future and the 
nation's role in the global economy. 

Ramos was elected president in the Philippines ' first multi-party 
election in 1992. He is a military hero of the 1986 Philippine People 
Power Revolution , 

Ramos discussed plans for "a stable, regional security environ-
ment," including a capable air/sea delense and a shift of the army's 
focus from countering insurgencies toward external defense. 

The faculty's collective decision was reached over a four-week peri-
od through a mail vote. 

Ballots were sent to nearly all faculty members May 16 after the 
Academic Senate voted 31 to 30 at its May 6 meeting to have a mail vote. 

Chemistry Professor Regitze Void requested the mail vote after the 
Representative Assembly had already voted - 34 to 23 with three 
abstentions - to establish the proposed charter high school. 

Political science Professor Ellen Comisso. medicine Professor 
Darnell Fanestil. history Professor Alden Mosshammer and economics 
Professor Ross Starr detailed their three main objections in the argu-
ment against the proposal. 

At the June Academic Senate meeting, Chancellor Robert Dynes set 
the charter high school proposal aside in favor of establishing an out-
reach task force to con ider the plan.

President Clinton Speaks at Commencement 

. By Ryan Olson 
On June 14, the graduates of UCSO's five colleges gathered at the RIMAC Field to hear President Bill 

Clinton deliver a speech on the state of race relations in America. 
Clinton told the graduates about a new "initiative on race" and spoke in support of affmnative action. 
"To those who oppose affirmative action, I ask you to come up with an alternative," Clinton said. "I would 

embrace it, if I could find a better way." . 
Clinton also introduced the members of an advisory board for his new initiative. For the next year, this 

board will hold a number of "town hall" meetings to discuss race issues. 
UC Regent Ward Connerly, a staunch opponent of affmnative action, was present at the commencement. 

He said that he welcomes the president to the debate over race, but that Clinton does not understand the situ-
ation in California. 

Clinton wasn't the only imponant dignitary to speak at Saturday's commencement ceremonies. Bill 
Richardson, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, spoke later that day at Eleanor Roosevelt College. 

The all-campus commencement was received warmly by students and administrators. Chancellor Robert 
Dynes said he was excited about having the entire campus community together in one place.

to increasing the numbers of underrepresented students" at UCSO. 

The UCSO K-12 Outreach Task Force was appointed in June after the 
faculty rejected Marshall Provost Cecil Lytle's charter high school proposal. 

Several different approaches will be used to reach underrepresented 
students. The task force recommended that UCSD have a "model" school 
to teach students from grades 6·12. 

Other recommendations include the creation of a Center for Research 
in Education Equity, Assessment and Teaching Excellence. The center will 
be responsible for coordinating and evaluating the clements of the task 
force's plan. 

The task force also suggested strengthening UCSD's existing outreach 
programs and promoting partnerships between UCSD and the community.

Governor Signs Fee-Freeze Bill 
By Ryan Ollon 

California Gov. Pete Wilson signed the College Affordability Act of 
1997 (AB 1318) into law on Oct. 6. As a result, mandatory UC and CSU 
undergraduate fees will drop by 5 percent in fall 1998. The bill had previ-
ously passed through the state legislature with broad bipartisan support. 

Between 1990 and 1995, student fees increased 134 percent at the 
University of California . The last time fecs were lowered was in 1984, and 
then only by a small amount. For the last three years, fees have been held 
at a steady level. 

The bill - sponsored by Assemblywomen Denise Moreno Ducheny, 
D-National City and Lt. Gov. Gray Davis - reduces undergraduate stu-
dent fees at the University of California and California State University by 
$190 during the 1998-99 academic year. The lowered fees would remain 
frozen through the 1999-2000 school year. 

Graduate and professional school tuitions will be frozen for the next 
two years but nonresident tuitions are unaffected by the bill.

William J. McGill Passes Away 
By Julia Kull~ad.r 

William 1. McGill, the university's third chancellor, died in October of 
heart failure. He was 75. 

McGill, as chancellor from 1968 to 1970, sheltered UCSD during the 
turbulent 19605. During that time, he defended philosophy Professor 
Herbert Marcuse from the accusations of San Diego and UCSD commu-
nity members. 

Almost immediately after McGill became chancellor, then-Gov. 
Ronald Reagan and other California conservatives opposed his decision to 
reappoint Marcuse as a professor. 

UC President Richard Atkinson, a former UCSD chancellor, worked 
with McGill. Atkinson said McGill left an indelible mark on UCSD. 

"I believe he was a very important figure in the evolution of UC San 
Diego," Atkinson said. "His presence as chancellor and as a faculty mem-
ber was critical to the great success that the university has had. The uni-
versity will always be indebted to him for the leadership that he provided." 

McGill joined UCSD as a professor of psychology in 1965, and he 
served as chancellor from 1968 to 1970. In 1970. he left to become the 
16th president of Columbia University. He stayed at Columbia until 1980 
and thcn returned to UCSD as an adjunct professor.

Mold Turns Undergraduate 
Library Into Study Area 
By Annam Manthlram 

Thc Undergraduate Library is no longer providing students with books; 
however, there is plenty of study space. 

In early September, library staff began to notice an outbreak of the 
Aspergillus mold on the Undergraduate Library's book collection. 

Although the staff instituted cleaning procedures. the mold could not 
be contained. 

Aspergillus is prevalent in the library because of recent hot and humid 
weather conditions. In addition to the mold, there was an infestation of 
book lice. Mold acts as an initial host.for book lice. 

The 35-year-old library has never had its ventilation or circulation sys-
tems upgraded. As a result. the staff could not effectively regulate the tem-
perature inside the library. 

Lucas said books will be available in mid-December for use in the first-
floor west wing of the Geisel Library.

Psycho Therapy 
Mary's Conundrum: When 
is Tact Important? 
By Mary HIggins Senior Staff Writer 
U Not A Licensed Therapist" 

I generally do not approve of 
lying and there is a good reason 
for it - I always get caught. Most 
of us have discovered by now that 
flat-out lies usually do more harm 
than good. 

On the other hand, flat-out 
honesty can be just as harmful. 
The only people who claim that 
honesty is the best policy are those 
who have not yet been told to 
pluck their "mono-brow." 

It is time for the truth-tellers of 
the world to understand that there 
is a fine line between quietly 
informing a friend during dinner 
that he has spinach between his-
front teeth, and blurting out during 
gym class that a few extra leg lifts 
might help tone those "cottage 
cheese thighs." 

What is this fine line? It's 
called "tact." Stay tuned. UCSD. 
and your relationships with your 
fellow human beings will last 
longer, I promise. 

We shall begin with the obvi-
ous: girls, your guy pals really 
don't appreciate your day-by-day 
updates on the progress of their 
hairline. 50 what if you need sun-
glasses to shield you from the 
glare off his head? They do not 
want to hear about it! 

However, guys, when girls ask 
if they look good in their jeans, in 
all cases reply with a resounding 
"YES!" Do not misinterpret the 
girl's "question" as a request for 
your actual opinion. You should 
say "yes." even if her thighs are 
wide enough to cause a shift in the 
earth·s gravitational pull. 

Case in point: after spending 
nearly $100 to have my hair high-
lighted. one male friend said he 
thought it looked "goofy." As Val 
Kilmer's love interest in "Top 
Secret" so eloquently put it, 
"Some things are better left 
unsaid." 

So let's see how much you 
have learned:

POP QUIZ: Your date for the 
Muir semi-formal shows up to 
your apartment wearing a baby-
blue blazer and a ruffled dress 
shirt. You (a) compliment him on 
his savvy fashion sense, (b) smile 
and thank him for the dandelion 
corsage he hand-picked from the 
Warren mall or (c) run screaming 
back into your room. refusing to 
come out until he's gone. 

The correct answer is (b). 
Option (a) was a trick - a tact-

ful person would never tell a 
shameless lie by pretending to 
admire clothing from Barry 
Manilow's fall collection. 

Here are a few. simple truth-
telling guidelines for those of you 
who are socially-impaired. 

First of all. can the current sit-
uation be improved by your hon-
esty? 

For example. if your 

(MIWd wtth ~, MIad, appetizer, makl, vegglet & rice, 

wife was about to present a 
keynote address at a nationally-
televised congressional hearing 
with giant boogers hanging from 
her nose, it would be a good time 
to be honest. 

However, commenting that her 
ears remind you of Spack is a tad 

- excessive - nothing short of 
plastic surgery can alter her 
Vulcan heritage. so your observa-
tion will accomplish nothing. 

Second, can a major tragedy be 
prevented by your honesty? Let's 
say you and your best friend are 
leaving the theater after seeing 
"01 lane" and she tells you she is 
thinking of shaving off her waist-
length hair. 

'The fact that she is even con-
sulting you in the first place 
means she is uncertain about the 
decision and is looking to you for 
guidance. Be honest and save her 
from an impulsive makeover. 

Last but not least. consider 
whether the situation is so dire 
that you are willing to risk the 
consequences of being honest. 
Perhaps you are fed up with your 
roommate's ambition to set a 
world record for going the longest 
time without bathing, The smell is 
driving away your girlfriend. the 
roaches in your cabinets and even 
the door-to-door salesman who 
keeps trying to sell you phony 
magazine subscriptions. 

You have been waffling for 
months over the seemingly impos-
sible choice: to remain silent will 
surely bring an end to your social 
life, but to speak up might offend 
your roommate, causing him to 
move out and take the TV with 
him. 

This situation is delicate and 
must be handled with tact. Instead 
of yelling, "Take a bath, you filthy 
ape!," use a more subtle approach. 
For instance, present him with 
bars of soap. shampoo. wash-

Women's Soccer Wins Third 
Consecutive National Title 
By Sean Rahlml 

The Tritons successfully defended their 1995 and 1996 champi-
onships with a 1-0 shutout over William Smith College (N.¥.) in the 
NCAA Final yesterday at Elizabethtown College, Pa. With the win, 
UCSD becomes the first team in the 12-year history of the tourna-
ment to win three consecutive national championships. 

Senior forward Lauren Johnson provided all the offense the 
Tritons would need on Sunday, scoring the game's' lone goal in the 
20th minute of play. It was the first goal William Smith (18-4) had 
allowed in 857 minutes over a span of eight-and-a-half games. 

The Tritons' solid defense proved to be impenetrable once again, 
not allowing a goal in the 180 minutes of Final Four play. 

Freeburg and defenders Maricela Oceguera and Janine Harispe 
were chosen for the All-Tournament team, while freshman Cindy 
Dostalek represented the offense as an All-Tourney selection.

Board Narrowly Grants 
Privileges 
By ErIka Snider 

LOS ANGELES - The UC Board of Regents nar-
rowly approved a plan to extend health-care benefits to 
the domestic partners of gay and lesbian university 
employees. According to the proposal's supporters. this 
move will help ~etain employees and keep the universi-
ty competitive. 

The proposal was approved 13 to 12 with one abstention, 
despite Wilson's efforts to prevent the item from passing. 

Wilson appointed three new regents, one Wednesday 
and two more between the Thursday and Friday ses-
sions. All three of the new regents were allowed to 
immediately become voting members of the board. They 
all voted against the proposal. 

According to the proposal. drafted by UC President 
Richard Atkinson, the estimated cost of providing health 
benefits to employees' same-sex domestic partners 
would be between $1.9 million and $5.6 million. 

In order to qualify for benefits. a couple must each be 
at least 18 years of age, have lived together for at least 
12 months, show mutual financial support and sign a 
contract stating that these conditions have been mel.

Thousands of faithful Tritons packed the RIMAC

mous odds throughout the NCAA Division III Final 
Four hosted at UCSD, Dec. 5-6. 

UCSD edged by No. 7 Central (Iowa) on Friday in

On Saturday, the Tritons were able to comeback 
down two games to none against No. I-ranked Juniata

break the truth to him gently: 

"Dirwood. you have a bad habit of forgetting to 
use deodorant. That is why all 200 students 
dropped out of your engineering class last quar-
ter." 

Let's take a moment 10 address the concerns of 
"Bill," a Warren freshman who is having trouble with 
tact. 

"Dear Mary, my girlfriend is constantly asking me 
if she looks fat. Am I supposed to be honest, or 
what?" 

Ah. the tempestuous woman strikes again. Bill. let 
me guess, when you tell her she is not fat, she gets 
depressed because she thinks you are lying. When 
you tell her she is fat she gets depressed because she 
thinks you don't love her. 

Seems like a no-win situation. right? 
First. let me tell you that your girlfriend has a cer-

tain image of her body and. despite your constant 
reassurances. she is still going to look in the mirror 
and see herself as a contender for the La 10lla Sumo 
Wrestling Championship. However, you can help 
improve her self-esteem by drawing attention away 
from her "problem areas." 

For example, you can say, "Honey, look at her. 
She's way fatter than you are!" 

I'm just kidding. of course. Seriously. try com-
plimenting her on other features such as her hair or 
her eyes. Take her to the gym with you or teach her 
how to rollerblade; it will do wonders for her self-
est.cem. 

Above all, reassure her that the reason you are 
going out with her is that you are attracted to her per-
sonality. Right, Bill? Bill?

W~men" s Basketball Already In Midseason Form 
WINNING WAYS: Not to be outdone by their male counterparts, the Tritons are having tremendous early-season success 
By Travis Hili 
Sports Editor 

The theme of UCSD's fall 
sports was Girl Power. The 
women 's soccer and vol -
leyball squads each 
brought 1997 National 
Championship banners to 
RIMAC 's walls. 

With wi nter sport now 
in full swing, it appears 
that Girl Power is here to 
lay a the consistently 

successful women 's bas-
ketball team upped its record to 9-3 
with a 75·59 drubbing of Redland 

University last Saturday. 
Although it is much too early in 

the season to be talking National 
Championship, so far the Tritons 

have been a force to be 
reckoned with. 

Things looked bad 
early on, as UCSD suf-
fered a big personncl loss 
when senior forward Karli 
Jungwirth left the team for 
personal reasons. 

Many believed that her 
departure would create a 

gaping hole on the post, but the 
Tritons have regrouped. Many have 

been forced into new roles, but 
everyone is responding to the call. 

"A lot of people have stepped 
up." Jenessa Bayda said. "They are 
filling roles we needed. Kate 
[Turnbull) has been playing really 
well." 

Head Coach Judy Malone 's 
troops went 4-1 over the holiday 
break, including a second-place 
finish in the UC San Diego 
Doubletree Invitational. 

Although second placc is noth-
ing to scoff at, the Tritons came 
within three points of taking first, 
losing to Chapman University in a 

Championship nail-biter, 62·59. 
Bayda played especially well 

throughout the tournament, gamer-
ing All-Tournament honors. 

The Tritons played two January 
contests, both blowout victories. 
The first contest was at home 
against the John Carroll University 
(Ohio) Blue Streaks. To say this 
game was a mismatch would be an 
understatement. 

Annihilation would be a better 
term as UCSD destroyed the 
Streaks, 100·49. Guard Krista 
Poehler led the charge with 20 
points, and Turnbull chimed in 

with 12. 
The second came last Saturday, 

the Tritons went on the road to 
Redlands and had no trouble dis-
patching the Bulldogs. 

As u ual, it was a team effort as 
Summer Begley and Turnbull each 
had a dozen points, Amy McClure 
had 10, and Jenessa Bayda and 
Genevieve Ruvald chipped in with 
eight apiece. Turnbull also led the 
team with 13 rebounds. 

Next up for the Tritons is a bat-
tle against Whittier College tomor-
row night at 7 p.m. at RIMAC 
Arena.

Eight In A Row For UCSD 
HAPPY HOLIDAYS: The Tritons enjoyed great success over the break, 
and it continued last night with a 93-86 win over John Carroll University 
By Kevin McLau .... lln 
Co-Associate Sports Editor 

Don't touch that dial! 
Just when the season of the 

men's basketball team was taking a 
nose·dive, UCSD appears 

while shooting an amazing 18 for 
21 from the floor. Two days later at 
Cal Lutheran, Field went for 30 
points and 20 rebounds, leading the 
team to a 77-69 victory. 

the opposition, but the pressure 
remains constant and makes for a 
fast-paced game. 

Tyler Field remains the biggest 
reason for the late Triton turn-
around. 

CHAMPS: 
It was dramatic, 
euphoric, historic

McFarland said. "She came out 
really focused and ready to play."

going to save anything. We're 
going to give all that we've got. '" 

Despite the sense of hope, 
UCSD still found itself down 9-2 
in the third game with the match 
on the line. Suddenly, almost as if 
in a fairy· tale movie, everything 
began to click for the Tritons. The 
capacity crowd was quick to pick 
up on the swing in momentum 
and UCSD fed off the energy to 
tie the score. With the Triton 
offense working on all cylinders, 
UCSD stormed past the Eagles 

-

to have righted itself. After 
opening the season 1-4, 

Field's performance in 
his first three games was 
enough to earn him 
NCAA Division III 
National Player of the 
Week. Field has filled in 
the hole left by the depar-
ture of All-American cen-
ter Matt Aune, and has 
made the Tritons a very 

"Tyler Field definitely helps," 
Triton Assistant Coach Dave Dillon 
said. "If they doubie him, he can 
kick it out for threes, and if they 
don't, he's very effective in the 
post." 

While the win against Central 
proved to be dramatic, the finals 
against No. I ranked Juniata 
College (Pa.) is the stuff that leg-
ends are made of. The Eagles 
entered the match with a stellar 
43-1 record and were coming off 
an impressive sweep of No. 2 
ranked Washington University 
(Mo.) in the semifinals. 
Meanwhile, the Tritons squeaked 
by Central and appeared to have 
their work cut out for them 
against the Eagles. 

and took the third game. .. 

the men have won eight 
straight games following a 
93-86 victory over 10hn 
Carroll University (Ohio) 
last night at RIMAC 
Arena. 

One might wonder how 
such a startling turnaround hap-
pened. Returning to the friendly 
environment of RIMAC was cer-
tainly a boost as the men began 
their streak with a 103-87 beating 
of Redlands on Dec. 13. 

But there is more to the story. 
Santa brought the Tritons a huge 
gift over the break in the form of 
freshman center Tyler Field. The 
6'9" mountain of a man, having 
freshly gained eligibility, has 
blown up like a volcano all over 
Division UI basketball. Field sports 
all the skills the Tritons badly need, 
providing much-needed height, 
inside scoring, rebounding and 
warding off would-be scorers on 
defense. 

Field's impact was felt immedi-
ately. Against Point Loma 
Nazarene College in only his sec-
ond game, the big man exploded 
for 40 points and 16 rebounds 

competitive, balanced and enter-
taining team. 

"I think Tyler Field was the big 
key," sophomore swingman Cole 
Miller said. "His athleticism and 
size and rebounding have added to 
the team's effectiveness." 

After home wins against 
Redlands, Occidental and Point 
Loma. the men continued winning 
on the road against Cal Lutheran 
before coming back home to dis-
pense with Midland Lutheran 
College two days after Christmas, 
104-91. Hacked on countless occa-
sions, Field went 12 for 17 from the 
free throw line to score 32 points 
with 17 rebounds. 

The team continues to play a 
frenetic, pressing style of defense, 
alternating between a full-court 
zone and full-court man-to-man. 
The trapping press can create 
turnovers or allow easy baskets to 

h 0 p 

Other players have benefited 
from the addition of a lrue post 
player. Forward Mike Wall has 
returned to a more natural position 
and no longer has to concentrate on 
playing in the paint. On Saturday 
night's 105-88 drubbing of 
Whittier College, Wall shot 10 for 
12 from the field to notch 23 points 
in 23 minutes. He is second on the 
team in points per game, rebounds, 
steals and field goal percentage, 
and leads the team in three-pointers 
made. 

Guard Adam Libby, who has 
been shooting the three-ball with 
precision lately, now garners a 
greater number of assists, including 
a season-high 13 against Whittier. 
Libby is also averaging 13 points 
per game this season. 

Tyler Garratt has continued 
strong play from· the other guard 
position, including 21 points 
against La Verne on the road, with 
a buzzer-beater to give the Tritons a 
narrow 82-81 win.

GOLDFISH e D J BOJ.O 

Appearances did not deceive 
as Juniata quickly established 
itself as the most athletic team 
that UCSD has faced. Where 
Triton kills had gone untouched 
by other opponents, the Eagle 
defense was digging balls left and 
right and all the while picking up 
points. 

By the time the smoke had 
cleared from the first game, the 
Tritons found themselves in a 
hole and sinking fast 

The second game was much 
the same, with few UCSD high-
lights. Entering the third game, 
McFarland's squad found itself 
down two games, with its back 
against the wall and looking for 
inspiration. The squad found it in 
the form of Ebadi and Brynjestad. 

"We weren't about to give 
up," Ebadi said. "We said, 'We 
love this team and we're not 

Riding the wave of energy, the 
Tritons came out charging in the 
founh game. Brynjestad contin-
ued to pick apart the Juniata 
defense which opened up holes 
for the rest of the UCSD attack-
ers. Middle blockers Shannon 
Noonan and Dena Strube along 
with Bender and Salter put away 
clutch kills for the Tritons. 

With the tension now on the 
Juniata side, the Eagles began to 
make mistakes and UCSD took 
full advantage. The momentum of 
the Tritons was not about to be 
stopped as they knotted the match ~ I 
at two games apiece. 

In a storybook ending for the 
ages, UCSD held off the Eagl~ in 
a tight fifth game to capture the 
National Championship and com-
plete an undefeated season 
against Division m opponents. 

Ebadi and Brynjestad were 
both named to the all-toumamenI 
team and with the home crowd in 
a frenzy the Tritons hoisted up the 
National Championship ttophy. 

"The crowd was amazing," 
Ebadi said. "I loved them. This 
was the best farewell you could 
ask for." "'"

WALKING ON AIR: The women's volleyball team used home court to its advantage in finishing 
the season undefeated again t Division III opponents and giving UCSD its seventh national title 

By Steve Walsh 
Senior Sports Writer 

If the writers at Disney were looking to 
script another fairy-tale sports spectacular, 
they would be hard-pressed to create a more 
captivating and uplifting story 
than the title run of the 1997 
National Champion UC San Diego 
women's volleyball team. 

The Tritons had all the ele-
ments necessary for a blockbuster 
hit: they were underdogs coached 
by a former volleyball great in his 
second year at the school, with 
only a single senior on the roster, 
led by an unlikely hero, in front of a home 
crowd. With all of those elements working for 
them, it is no wonder the Tritons were 
crowned the nation's top squad. 

While a few UCSD students stayed home 
to study for finals , 4,000 Triton faithful 
packed RIMAC to watch their team overcome 
enormous odds throughout the two-day tour-
nament. 

On Friday, No. 3 ranked UCSD squared off 
again t No.7 Central (Iowa), an athletic quad 
that reached the Final Four riding a IO-match 
win streak. They overpowered team u ing 
great heart and a pair of seemingly un top-
pable middle bl kers . 

With the standing-room-only crowd on its 
feet, the Tritons opened game one against the 
Dutch using their most powerful weapon: a 
tough serve. Defensive specialist Jaime 
Hackleman split the Central defense for an ace 

and UCSD quickly grabbed the 
momentum. 

Throughout the season, Triton 
Head Coach Duncan McFarland 
juggled his lineup to get the most 
from his talented and deep roster; 
the only exception being senior 
All -American setter Sherine 
Ebadi, who never wavered as the 
glue that held the team together. 

The opposite hitter position had been 
shared by junior Katherine Brynjestad and 
freshman Shannon Hawes. McFarland chose 
to go with Bryjestad against the Dutch. He 
made the perfect choice. 

With its serves keeping Central on its heels 
and Brynjestad hitting undiggable shots, 
UCSD jumped to a 6-2 lead. Then five straight 
service points by sophomore Alison Bender 
put the game out of reach as the Tritons won, 
15-3. 

While the first game had been all 
Brynjestad's, Ebadi chose the second game to 
show why she is considered one of the top set-
ters in the nation. Using a blistering jump-

serve, Ebadi single-handedly dismantled 
Central on the way to five aces and a 15-8 win. 

Up two games to none, the match appeared 
over, but Central was not about to roll over, 
and they took the third game 15-6. 

The Tritons opened the fourth game, 
though, as if they had won the first two and 
jumped out to an early lead. An ace by junior 
outside hitter Dana Salter followed by another 
Bryjestad kill made the score 9-6 and 
appeared to lock up the match for the Tritons. 

But Central would not go away, and with 
the help of a questionable call by the officials, 
the Dutch took the game. 

"It wasn't just a matter of us struggling [in 
games 3 and 4]," McFarland said. "They 
[Central) have a good team and they really 
increased the pressure with their serving and 
blocking." 

The fifth game was another chance for 
Brynjestad to shine. The Central block had no 
answer for her as she finished the match with 
24 kills. After blitzing out to an 8-1 lead, the 
Tritons again allowed things to get interesting 
as Central began to close the gap. Despite 
making all the RIMAC faithful worry, UCSD 
managed to hang on and advance to the cham-
pionship match with a 15-13 win.
