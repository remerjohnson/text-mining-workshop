Tritons going to World Series

The confrontation wa

with high national rankings, 
played four hard fought games

developed an Inten e nvalry.

have much better pitchers than La

But now that their best-of-five 
playoff series ha ended, the 
Triton (32-11) have proven to be, 
by far, rhe superior team. They 
eliminated La Verne (27-21) in 
three straight games, and are now 
headed for the College World 

Indeed, it would be hard to hope 
for more, considering the fact that 
all three Triton staners pitched 
complete games, and the olTense

Condors fight for suIVival in California 
By MIKE HORELICK 

It is a strange contradiction -
the Califomia condor pos esse 
our state's name, yet our chance 
of seeing this huge bird fly 
overhead amount to zero . 
According to Paul Toone. a 
condor expert at the an Diego 
Wild Animal Park, there are no 
co ndors left in the wild . and 
unlc s an aggressive aptive 
breeding program is pursued . the 
condor will become a extin t as 
the dodo bird . 

Toone is responsible for 
trapping the first condors and 
collect ing the fir t egg th at were 

u cesslully hatched . He 
attended Revelle wlege before 
transferring to DaVIS where 
he earned hI Master Degree In

Concern about the Cali-
fornia condor is not as recent 
a development as some people 
might th ink. To see that the 
federal government declared the 
condor extinct in 1900 i to see 
an awareness of, if not concern 
for. the plight of the California 
condor. It was later di covered 

that some condors were left on a 
ranch nonh of Los Angele ,and , 
in 1950, the an Diego Zoo got a 
permit for a captive breeding 
program. The permit. however. 
wa revoked due to pre ure from 
the ational Audubon 0 iety 
(NA ) who complained that 

apture breeding should be used 
a a la t re ort. De pite the 
differing philo ophles, in 1979 
the an Diego Zoo regained 

permission for the program and 
by 1983, four condor eggs were 
collected . 

"From four eggs we expe ted 
one hi k." Toone said , "but we 
hatched four eggs and rai ed four 
chicks ." All together. 15 eggs were 
pulled and 13 urvived. The

Alkonis. however. had to feel lucky

rhe stOry stans on the last day of 
the regular eason and a week after 
UC D swept a doubleheader from 
La Verne. As the TritOn were 
playing at Claremont, a couple 
members of the La Verne team 
were in the stands. The y 
continually heckled the UC D 
team, and Singled out Alkonis 
particularly. "Maybe they felt kind 
of humiliated." explained Alkonis. 

When La Verne brought in a 
relief pitcher on Friday, Alkonis 
recognized him as one of the 
hecklers. First. he doubled off the 
reliever, but in hi second-at-bat, 
he struck out. As he walked back 
towards UC D's dugout . he 
noticed another pitcher taring 
him down. 

"I put my head up to ee what he 
was doing," Alkonts aid. "Then I 
walked tOwards hIm." The th ird 
ba eman tarted to yell at Alkonis,

second fight the rwo teams have

CONDOR: in near extinction in California 
Continued from pall:e 1 
deaths of si of the 15 wild 
condors in 1984, which 
eliminated four of lIve breeding 
condor pairs . not only was this 
plan cancelled, but the remalnlllg 
condors were aptured and 
taken to the Wild Antmal Park. 

"When you have a species 
I whose] number are so srnilll , 
the geneli i ue is a very 
Imporwnr one." Toone 
explaliled 

On January 18, 196. AC3 , the 
lilst female Cahforma condor In 
the wild, died of lead poisonlilg. 
As a consequence, a deci ion 
was made to capture the 
rl!;rnaining condor. "We had 
Jnu:nded to keep rwo 
populallons gOing (one In 
' aptlvit)' and one wild ). but the 
birds died 111 an uncontrollable 
manner: Toone said. 

Although no condors eXist 
today in the wild, there are 14 
males and 13 fern,lles 111 
aptlvit)' They ,m in secluded 

cages In the Los Angeles Zoo 

and the 5,111 Diego Wdd Antm,11 
Park. and Toone n tes, that 
seclUSion Will hopc!ull)' lead to 
successful mating of the bird . 
The chicks hatched 111 captivity 
will reilch se ual n;taturity 111 
1990, whl h Toone hopes will be 
the first year of releasc. However, 
the releasc wdl not be the end of 
the quest. 

The blggesl problem 
confronting the re!cased condors 
is its consumption of !c,ld 
pOIsoned 'camon, Toone said. 
This problem Will be partially 
solved if the federal govemment 
bans game hunting with lead ' 
bullets, as it has planned to do. 
Unfortunately. lead pOIsoning is 
,1150 caused by lead fragments 
from copper coated shells , he 
added 

TOlme ~ee" the demise 01 the 
Cahlornl,1 clmLll)r ,IS a direct 
result 01 m,ln . "I wouldn 't be as 
Involved 111 thiS program If it 
weren't ,\ hum,1I1 problem. We 
have an oblig,ltIon to turn It 
around ," he explained
