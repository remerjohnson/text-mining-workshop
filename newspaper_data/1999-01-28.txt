Neuropsychiatric Institute 
and Hospital (NPIH) for the 
wrongful death of Sujon 
Guha in 1993 is about 10 go 
to trial. Guha's father, Arun, 
filed suit against the NPIH 
and the UC Regents because 
he believes that the hospital 
negligent care resulted in the 
suicide of his son. Guha was 
involuntarily committed at 
NPIH in 1993 for suicidal 
tendencies. Five days after 
being committed, Guha was 
found hanging from a helt in 
his hospital room closet. 
Prior to heing committed, 
Guha was taking Maxolon, a 
drug that has been shown to 
cause psychotic side effects 
in some people.

the misuse of the uni,versity 's

his position as director of the 
laboratory, Maggio negotiated 
business contracts between the 
university and sponsor agen-

Maggio said that the university

CAMPUS DIVERSITY 

c.puy-...: Roosevelt Senior Julie Ward listens as former UCSD Chancellor Dr. Herbert 
York discusses campus diveristy and the university's role in California's future . 

Former Chancellor Herbert 
York Speaks On Diversity 
SPEECH: International Affairs 
Group sponsored talk with chair at 
Pepper Canyon Lodge 

among faculty and students through informa-
tion, education and outreach. 

York said that some members of the UC 
administration believe that the university 
should represent the diversity of the state.

Former UCSD Chancellor Herbert York 
addressed the issues of diversity in Califomia 
and its impact on UCSD last Monday night at a

the first large, diverse - and rich - society in 
the world," York said. "The university wants to 
be a pan of this progress and will continue to 
confirm - contrary to opposing opinions -

meeting of. the International 
Allairs Group at the Pepper 
Canyon Lodge. 

In November, Chancellor 
Robert Dynes appointed 
York chair of the newly 
formed Chancellor's 
Advisory Committee on 
Diversity. This 18-person 
committee, including three 
students, will advise both 
the chancellor in his role as 
chief diversity , officer and 
the vice chancellors as to 
what goals UCSD should 
establish to achieve greater 
diversity on campus. 

The group is also 
charged with identifying 
programs that could best 
impact diversity, recom-
mending how resources 
could be used to coordinate 
diversity goals, identifying 
barriers to diversity at 
UCSD and providing a 
forum for discussion of 
diversity-related issues on 
campus.

that diversity and quality 
can coexist within a univer-
sity." 

York said that he believes 
UCSD, along with UC 
Berkeley, Stanford 
University and UCLA, are 
living proof that diversity 
does not hinder the progress 
of a university. He cited 
these institutions for demon-
strating that diversity 
enhances the education and 
atmosphere of the universi-
ty. York also said that he 
thinks UCSD is the best uni-
versity in the nation among 
those founded in this centu-
ry. 

"Many people Ihought 
that you couldn't emphasize 
both quality and diversity, 
but at the same time as 
UCSD introduced diversity, 
it was in the process of 

. becoming the best universi-
ty in the nation," he said.

Green UCSD 
Project Results 
in New Policy 
ENVIRONMENT: Over 800 
students, staff and faculty signed 
petition to show their support 
By Elaine Wong 
Staff Writer 

Having issued ils revised policy on waSle 
prevention, UCSD will soon be seeing more 
green. 

The policy, Ihe resuh of a projecl called 
Green UCSD. includes specific standard~ 
and organization processes designed 10 
improve UCSD's waste prevention pro-
grams. 

The policy calls for reducing waSle atlhe 
source and encouraging Ihe purcha~e of 
durable reusable producls and high po~l­
consumer conlenl recycled products. 

It also calls for an increase in the IOlal 
volume of waste materials diverted from 
landfills to recycling processes. The policy 
also helps to ensure the long term viability 
of campus recycling operations through 
education programs, coordination, manage-
ment and oversight and compliance with 
Federal and State mandates. 

Anthony Barrell , project leader of 
Green UCSD, initiated the poli9 along 
with Tricia Bolle, president of the 
Environmental Coalition at UCSD and 
CaIPIRG. 

Barrell began a petition in support of the 
changes in this policy last fall. Over gOO 
students, slaff, facuhy and community 
members signed the petition 10 show their 
support. 

"From my experience working with stu-
dents and staff at UCSD, I noticed that the 
previous recycling program wasn't living 
up to what people had expected," Barrell 
said. 

"This new policy will improve the envi-
ronmental impact of UCSD," he added. 
'There are around 30,000 students, staff, 
facuhy and researchers at this university. 
Using recycled paper will reduce the poten-
tial for environmental damages." 

Barrell and Bolle stated, in a leller to 
Chancellor Robert Dynes and Vice-
Chancellor of Business Affairs Steve 
Relyea, that the employees at UCSD will 
only realize the quality of recycled products 
if they use them. 

They also said that the price of recycled 
products is high because the demand for 
them is low, due to the idea that these prod-
ucts are inferior in quality and higher in 
price. 

Barrell and Bolle stated thai by driving 
up the volume of recycled products demand-
ed, the price for such products wi II be driven 
down. 

A leller from Dynes to all students staled 
that he has asked Relyea and the Waste

who represent only one-eighth of

York also said that the female

sludents is irregular. He said that 
women comprise about SO percent 
of ans and social science graduate 
students, compared 10 10 to 20 per-
l.'enl in fields· .uch as physics and

Teaching Assistants 
Shouldn't Wait, Strike Now 

The last two weeks of fall quarter were marred by 
the disruption generated from the TA strike for union 
recognition and collective bargaining. The strike, 
which lasted a week, forced many professors to make 
significant changes to their final exams to compen-
sate for the lack of assistance. Final grades were 
unquestionably affected by the alteration of grading 
policy which, in some cases, provided a blanket "A" 
to anyone who bothered to tum in a final. 

While these practices had a positive impact on 
many students' GPAs, the result undermines the very 
purpose of grading and cheapens the educational 
experience here at UCSD. 

Just as the quarter concluded, the University of 
California administration and the TAs' union, the 
United Auto Workers (UAW), agreed to a 45-day 
cooling-off period. Now that this period is over, no 
progress has been made, no issues have been dis-
cussed and the TAs intend to strike again. 

One member of the Association of Graduate Student 
EmployeeslUA W at Berkeley, Scott Prudham, stated, 
"We will be meeting with our members to determine 
the most effective time to resume our strike." 

The "most effective time" is now. Today. The rea-
son that this dispute has dragged on for 15 years is 
simply because the TAs' threats have never been 
effectively followed through. Every year there are a 
few weeks or days during which students and admin-
istration feel the adverse effects of the strike and then 
business resumes as usual. 

For the strike to be taken seriously by both the stu-
dents and administration, the TAs must change the 
image of their strike from being "when it's conve-
nient" to "now and until our demands are met." Based 
on the aftermath of fall quarter, it seems quite clear 
that TAs are willing to withhold their labor from the 
university only so long as to disrupt the student's 
lives for a short time before coming back to work. 

This most recent example of the TAs' inability to 
follow through on their threats constitutes another 
crushing blow to their battle for recognition. If any 

. progress is to be made on the .issue, the TAs must be 
resolute in their goal and strike until their demands are 
mel. Since this "cooling-off' period has proved fruit-
less, the TAs should demonstrate their dissatisfaction 
with the lack of progress and strike back now. 

Props and Flops 

~ Props to the 3,713 highly spirited individuals who attended Spirit Night last Friday, lifting UCSD to a new level and proving to everyone that UCSD is not only ahout academics. Because 
of these individuals. Spirit Night '99 will always 
he considered a triumph in UCSD history. 

Congratulations and thank you to Eric 
Rohner, Zack Beehee and Chris Shelton who 
raised over $8000 in prizes for Winterfest '99. 
There arc fahulous prizes. ranging from In·N· 
Out Burger coupons to ski tickets. by hringing 
canned food to RIMAC Arena this Saturday. 

~ Flops to the "security" personnel at the -:. UCSD Bookstore, who will go to great lengths to prevent students from carrying backpacks into the bookstore, yet have a difficult time keeping 
random students from walking off with back-
packs that are not their own. It seems the book-
store is more concerned about its own merchan-
dise than the piece of mind of its customers. .

The pre-med route at UCSD that 
many aspiring doctors journey as 
undergraduates is geared toward mak-
ing little monsters out of pre·med stu-
dents. Even those who are not science 
majors have heard the "myths" about 
science courses and the pre-med track. 
Through his grievances, my friend 
Woody was quick to dispel me of the 
"myths" by making it perfectly clear 
that they were all true. 

The competition between pre-med 
students at UCSD is horrendous. 
Exam scores and course grades are 
based upon a curve, where the perfor-
mance of students sets the highs, the 
lows and the means. Students are pit-
ted against each other like gladiators 
and forced into competing so as to 
receive the better grade. 

The stories I heard from Woody 
were utterly shocking. For example, 
some students are so desperate for the 
higher grade that they go to the extent 
of purposely giving incorrect answers 
to other students. Others horde over 
their work as if it were top secret gov· 
ernment information that, if uncov-
ered, would gravely endanger the 
security of the United States. Some of 
the students will even contaminate lab-
oratory experiments or steal other stu-
dents' lab notebooks. 

The biology department, for exam-
ple, is not a sharing environment. 
Students do not come together to 
exchange ideas or heighten their 
knowledge by learning from one 
another. On the contrary, Sandra, a 
Warren senior, says "people aren't 
here to be nice. They're here to get 
their-degrees. and the biology depart-

UCSD .... one of the 
most respeCted and

that level of 
excellence In all 
upect. of their 
ac .... mlc career, .... 
profeuois who are 
apathetic, 
co!'descendlng snobs. 
ment fosters this attitude." 

Sandra, a transfer student, experi-
enced first-hand the harsh environ-
ment encouraged by UCSD with her 
lirst course in O-Chem. She had no 
idea what to expect beforehand. No 
one had prepared her for the enormous 
rooms packed to the brim with over 
200 students, the impersonal profes-
sors who blazed throuJh IhC niieriaI 
in SO minutes IIId the ...... wIlD 
were unable - or 1"IIIIer, ... wil., -

f 
\. 

to help her with a few questions. Both 
Sandra and Woody had the same com· 
plaints about UCSD's competitive 
environment. 

Sandra says she also has many 
qualms about professors and the man-
ner in which they choose to treat their 
students. According to her, one chem-
istry professor "is a pompous, arro-
gant, rude man who is not shy about 
telling his students that he doesn't like 
teaching undergrads." Apparently, this 
professor is "out of touch" and views 
his students as "numbers and not peo-
ple." . 

On the topic of defective profes-
sors: Jody, a Warren senior, alsO has 
complaints about one professor in the 
UCSD School of Engineering. He says 
that this professor "goes crazy when a 
student asks her a question." The pro-
fessor has been known to take live 
minutes out of class time to reprimand 
students for looking into their text-
books. On one occasion, Jody asked 
the professor a question about the 
material and she "lost her breath, got 
out of control, stomped around the 
classroom," and didn't even answer his 
question. Jody complains that "nobody 
wants to ask her a question because 
they are scared of her." 

There is a problem when students 
are scared of their professors. There is 
also' a problem when students are 
viewed as "generic geniuses" (quoting 
Sandra's intelligent rendition), expect-
ed, in a SO-minute time period, to take 
note of complex problems and multiple 
fonnulas and" then digest them only to 
regurgitate the information for a 
midterm. Is that really learning'! 
Students cannot be expected to learn 
much in SO minutes when the professor 
is not even willing to take the time to 
answer questions. Sandra says that 
some professors jUII don't care. '1'hey 
arc raean:hen, not felchen," she Slid. 
'-rhey don't Wanllo be bothenld."

RAVING RUINS REpUTATION CANNIBALS: Professors, courses

on the Monday of finals week. 
One was at8 a.m., the other at II

ing to reschedule the final for her. 
I do not understand how this cir-

On Sunday, Jan. 10, 1999, a 

"rave" was held in the Price Center, 
as mentioned in the Guardian 
("Down in the Center," Jan. II, 
1999). 

. This event was sponsored by 
such student organizalions as the 
ASUCSD, UCAB, GSA, RCC, 
VCSA and the WCSC, not to men-
tion it also held the suppon of the 
vice chancellor. Because of these 
supponive groups, the event was 
made free to all students. 
However, little did these sponsors 
know that this free event was a 
rave. 

The proof that it was a rave is 
shown on the Internet in a web 
page titled "ravelinks," which 
advenised this event as a rave, and 
even showed a picture of this wild 
party taking place in the Price 
Center. 

In order to no't charge an 
entrance fee, the money had to be 
laken from the students here at 
UCSD. And as a side note, the 
majority of the students that 
attended this rive were not stu-
dents from UCSD, but were many 
high school students from neigh-
boring areas such as L.A .• Orange 
County and Irvine. So our tuition, 
money that we as UCSD students 
use 10 pay for education, was 
actually spent to put on a rave that 
the majority of us did not even 
attend. 

The things that take place at a 
rave are definitely not the kind of 
things that should be taking place 
on a university camous. For exam-

kinds of drugs like ecstacy, mari-

If people want 10 attend these 
kinds of events otT campus or in 
their own free time, that is fine. 
But having an event like this on 
campus was inappropriate. When 
the word gets out that there was a 
rave on our campus, then we will 
get looked down upon because this 
event was basically a drug pany for 
non UCSD students, using our

Is this the kind of reputation

DecI __ of 0Ihers 
Editor: 

As an alumni of UCSD, who 
graduated Magna Cum Laude, is a 
member of t~. : Golden Key Honor 
Society and a member of a sorority, 
I was appalled at the aRicie written 
by Jeremy Gray ("Rush Weak," 
Guardian, Jan. II. 1999). It was a 
narrow·minded look at so-called 
"Greek Life" filled with meaning-
less generalizations and unfounded 
claims. 

I agree that being in a sorority or 
a fraternity is not for everyone, 
however, it is not necessary to clas-
sify all Greeks as those who like 
"sossiping and dressing alike." 

I am not going to waste my time 
and energy describing what I think 
of him and his opinion of Greek 
organizations but instead focus on 
his inability to live and let live. 
Why should sorority and fraternity 
members spark such insidious 
remarks from you" As a sorority 
member, I have respect for his deci-
sion to refrain from joining a Greek 
organization. Why can't he have 
respect for those of us who have 
chosen to join sororities and frater· 
nities" It would be much more ben· 
eficial for him to concentrate, 
instead, on how to improve his own 
time at UCSD. 

It is narrow-minded people 
like him who are the ones to 
squelch individuality by project-
ing their views and prejudices 
upon others. 

Jennirer L. Case 

UCSD has one of the most 
respected and nationally ranked 
pre·med programs. It is shameful 
that a university that prides itself 
on excellence, and requires its 
students to maintain that level of 
excellence in all aspects of their 
academic career, has professors 
who are apathetic, condescending 
snobs. Is that the kind of altitude 
the university desires? Should we 
go around campus and make oth· 
ers feel like idiots, .laugh at them 
for being freshman or brush them 
aside for not being directly 

. involved with what we're doing? 
That's not right. But some profes· 
sors are still gelting away with 
these altitudes. 

'There seem 10 be a lot of pre· 
med and science students out 
there ~ho are unhappy with the 
present curriculum. The require· 
ments that are demanded from 
them are extremely grueling. The 
environment in which they are 
placed does not make the situa-
tion any better. 

It is understandable that the 
department wants to weed out the 
weak from the strong and prepare 
aspiring medical students with the 
required knowledge and skills. 
However, it is not understandable 
that a professor should be so 
unreasonable as not to reschedule 
an exam for a student who has 
back·to-back finals. 

Sandra experienced this situa-
tion, as well as, I am sure, many 
other students. She had two finals 

So. pre-med students arc 
required to maintain a good GPA, 
have research experience, volun-
teer at a hospital and receive a 
high score on the MCAT, if they 
want to be accepled to a good 
medical school (i.e. UCSD's 
School of Medicine). They are 
also required to deal with uncar· 
ing professors, to work with each 
other in a competitive environ-
ment. to pay through the nose for 
books and, topping it all off, 
many of them have to work. 

Pre-mcd students don't have it 
easy - not to say that other 
majors are any less dillicult. But 
at least a student can talk to a his· 
tory professor after class without 
feeling completely dejected. 

Sandra is taking literature 
courses in which she experi-
ences a completely different 
environment. All UCSD courses 
are demanding, but as she states. 
"it is one thing to have high 
standards, and it is a completely 
different thing to not foster a 
learning environment." In fact, 
according to Sandra, a majority 
of students who get accepted to 
medical schools on a national 
level and get higher scores on 
the MCAT are history majors. 
Wow, now that's telling!

LASER TAG, FULL OF FREAKS 
JL;:~ Slop ThUll ~ BERTRAND AN 

If there is one thing that I 
learned this weekend, il is that one 
should never play laser tag wilh 
people that refer to themselves as 
Megatron and Exodus. 

Last Friday, after helping to 
"Save Dave" al the basketball 
game, my friends and I decided 
10 visit Ultrazone: The Ultimate 
Laser Adventure. Uilimately, I 
discovered that after II p.m. on 
Friday nighl is prime time for all the 
world's freaks to come out of hiding. 

After a brief inlroduclion to the 
game, the Game Master divided us 
up into groups. We did not have 
enough people for a full team so he 
added a few people to our group. 
One such person was a role player. 
Role players arc people so com-
pletely insecure about their own 
life that they purchase a member-
ship to Ultrazone, which allows 
them to take out their real-world 
aggressions on new players such as 
myself. It also gives them bragging 
rights to all their cyber-friends: 
"Yeah, last Friday I didn't sit at 
home developing my Advanced 
Dungeons and Dragons character 
and sorting out my Magic cards. I 
went to Ultrazone: The Ultimate 
Laser Adventure!" 

I was assigned to the green tearn 
and was lold to shoot red and yel-
low players, as well as destroy the 
red and yellow bases. 

Unfortunately, the colors green and 
yellow appear quite similar glowing 
in the dartt, so I shot at a few green 
people by accident. Then I made the 
mistake of shooting the role player. 
He started yelling at me, "I'm on 
your team! What are you doing? 
You're destroying the entire infra-
structure of the game and reducing 
the amount of cosmic balance!" 

So I did what any normal person 

had on his team. 
For some odd reason, my 

friends and I decided to play anoth-
er game. Part of the rationale was 
that one of my friends received a 
free game ticket because his pack 
did not work for half the game. 
Also, after midnight the rates are 
reduced. The only problem with 
this is that with reduced rates come 
even more people who are com-

base, reload station and crevice 

would have done - I shot him 
again. I was already a lillie pissed 
olT, as I banged against a wall and 
my entire ballery pack fell 01T. If 
your equipment malfunctions. 
you're supposed to stay in one spot 
and yell, "Game Master!" You can 
imagine the psychological elTects of 
yelling "Game Master!" for a full 
30 seconds would have on a person. 

After I got yelled at by the role 
player. I considered beating his 
head in with the bull of my gun, but 
instead I chose the calm and 
reserved thing to do -I continued 
to shoot him until he shut the hell 
up. I could see he was about 10 
crack, as he could not shoot me 
back without reducing his 
"supreme hit-sentinel-ratio-accura-
cy-factor." That and his team aver-
age would have been lowered even 
more, which appeared 10 be very 
important 10 him at the time. After 
the game, I heard him talking to his 
friend about what kind of idiots he 

of the complex. They dream of 
new strategies to shoot people and 
Ihe best way to dodge lasers. 

'P.le second game consisted of 
me walking around trying to find a 
reload station while everyone sniped 
me from above, or just blatantly fol-
lowed me around shooting me in the 
back. I remember I actually found a 
base. but it was guarded by four role 
players who yelled, "Green!" 
"Incoming" and "Base Infiltration!" 
and took turns shooting me. 

If you are considering playing 
laser tag after midnight, I suggest 
you save yourself the money and 
simulate it in your own dorm room. 
Get a laser pointer, run into your 
room, tum off the lights, and yell 
out whatever technical words you 
know while pointing the laser at the 
wall. After 15 minutes, tum on the 
lights, exit your room, and thank 
yourself for playing Ultrazone: The 
Ultimate Laser Adventure.

Freshmen Apathetic to School 
STUDY: UCLA poll 
finds that students put fun 
before academics, politics 
By ,......., friend 

Independent Rorida Alligator (U. 
Rorida) 

(U-WIRE) GAINESVILLE. 
Fla. - Freshmen spent 18.6 hours 
a week partying, 52.8 hours a week 
playing video games and 2.K hours 
a week siudying in 1997. according 
to an annual poll of freshmen 
released Monday. 

Those ligures show college 
freshmen 's interests in academics , 
and politics are at a record low, said 
Higher Education Research 
Institute officials who conducted 
the poll at the University of 
California ai Los Angeles. 

UCLA researchers saw a drastic 
drop in student's interest in acade-
mics in 1997. 

"These figures are consistent 
with whll wc'w: been seeing in the 
past surw:ys," said suney director 
Linda Sax, a UCLA education pr0-
fessor. "Students are still disenpged 
from both politics and academics." 

The poll surveyed 275.811 fresh-
men entering 469 two- and four-
year institutions in fall 1998. The 
poll found the students. compared to 
last year. are more often bored in 
class, spend less time studying and 
come to class late more often.

Freshman Justin Luna agrees 
his class is disinterested in acade-
mics. 

"When freshmen first get here, 
their minds are away from their 
parents. Most of them are 'like, 
'Wow, I'm away from my parents. 
I'm going to party now,'" said the 
UF newcomer. 

Sax said there are no indicators 
that students' academic disinterest 
will continue in the future. but she 
predicted students will start paying 
more allention to politics in about 
five years - if only because stu-
dents' apathy cannot get much 

worse. 

"You think it's going to have to 
bottom out sometime," Sax said. 

Student Body President John 
McGovern said he would guess UF 
students are not mirroring the polit-
ical apathy trend. 

"A large r;.:rcent of the partici-
pation in student government is 
freshmen. and the highest number 
of voters in the Spring elections arc 
freshmen," McGovern said. 

Sax said she was surpriscd stu-
dents arc discussing politics less, 
considering Presidcnt Clinton's 
impeachment he¥ings. 

Luna pointed out students only 
pay allention 10 news if the "media 
blurts it out big time and people 
make a "ig deal about it." 

"You're talking about the Jeny 
Springer freshmen that want stuff 
they can go 'omigod' to," Luna said 
with a laugh. 

In the same year UF started 
implementing its computer access 
requirement, UCLA researchers 
have found the Internet has become 
a way of life for students. 

Most of the freshmen surveyed 
in 1998 said they use the Internet 
for research or homework. 

"It's hard to say if that's good or 
bad." Sax said. "The dangers here 
are that students are using the 
Intemet and only the Internet, as 
opposed to going to the library to 
look up books."

••• 

a round come 
to UCSD to perform at our 
winter music festival this 
Saturday 

ontinuing a tradition 
that was initiated last 
year, the Associated 
Students Festival Com-
mittee will present the c winter quarter music 

festival, Winterfest, this Saturday, Jan. 30 
at RIMAC arena. Modeled somewhat after 
the Spring Sun God Festival, A.S. Council 
members say that they hope sponsoliing a 
festival each quarter will help bring UCSD 
students and campus organizations closer 
together. 

It was no easy task to match last year's 
Winterfest line-up of Big Bad Voodoo 
Daddy, Dance Hall Crashers and Goldfish, 
but A.S. Council has worked hard to book 
another great concert. This time the event 
will feature World Tribe, the Violent 
Femmes and Digital Underground. 

Kicking off the event will be Los 
Angeles locals, World Tribe. Their music 
is a mixture of Ricky B. Guinto's hard-
hitting guitar riffs , groove-oriented bass 
lines from Mike Hanel, harmonized hom 
lines from Ernie Munoz ' saxophone and 
the lead vocals of drummer Oren Avineri 
and keyboardist Shag. World Tribe's 
songs are unique compared to many cur-
rent groups, in that these guys emit a pos-
itive vibe by staying away from negative 
lyrics. 

With its great funk, reggae and punk 
blend, the five-piece band has quickly built 

up its list of accomplishments, including 
the 1997 release of its most recent album 
Element. which includes "Our World," a 
song to be featured in MTV's "Road 
Rules" show this season. 

Sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll and religion 
- straight from the streets of Milwaukee, 
the Violent Femmes will bring their 
diverse themes and "back-to-basics for-
mula" of acoustic guitar, bass and drums 
to UCSD. The group has the amaLing 
power, frankness and ability to speak to 
young audiences through such songs as 
"Blister in the Sun," "Kiss Off' and "Add 
It Up". 

Gordon Gano (vocals, guitar), Brian 
Ritchie (bass, vocals) and Guy Hoffman 
(drums, vocals) got their lucky break 
while playing in front of the theater 
where The Pretenders were performing. 
Honeyman Scott of The Pretenders spot -
ted the group performing and was 
impressed. The Femmes wound up in the 
opening spot at The Pretenders' show that 
very night. 

Since the beginning of its professional 
career, the group has re-recorded "Blister 
in the Sun" for "Grosse Pointe Blank" (a 
1997 feature film), and performed all 
across the country, including the ' 96 Lol -
lapalooza concert tour. Fifteen years and 
eight albums after their lucky start, the 
Violent Femmes continue to tour as head-

Senior Staff Wifer 

There was a rave at UCSD on Jan. 10 
called Movement. I don't think there was ever 
a more appropriate name for a party. To be 
honest, I was skeptical of it at first. The first 
time I heard of it was through a member of the 
DJ Club, Kristi, who also incidentally hap-
pened to be a close friend. 

It all began when Kristi, along with a few 
other cohorts, convinced me to go to a Hal-
loween party thrown J)y a group (some of you 
might know) called Moontribe. The night 
involved a two-hour drive to Los Angeles and 
the hopes of five ravers that the info line 
would have the directions to the party by the 
time we arrived. } kept thinking that the party 
wasn't going to happen or that the police 
would show up or a speaker would fallon 
somebody's ankle or head (both have been 
known to happen.) 

Fast forward four hours and find me groov-
ing with 500 hundred ravers packed in an 
artiSt's studio with the biggest "penna-smile" 
I'd had in mocths. In two hours I had been 
transported from feeling lower than belly lint to 
the upper echelons of seratonic ecstasy. Kristi 
was next to me, sharing a smoke with four 
strangers from Hollywood, when I thanked her 
for taking me with a hug.} didn't know exact-
ly why I had been in such a shitty mood earli-
er, and tried to blame it on various external 
issues. God forbid that the problem mighl actu-
ally be psychological. After a few minutes of 
pseudo soul searching, } finally found the 
object of my antipathy - San Diego. 

I told Kristi my revelations on the car ride 
home. She smiled and told me that the San 
Diego scene just wasn't up to par with Los 
Angeles yet. So it was understandable that 
San Diego might seem devoid of party life or 
culture. but there were definitely ravers out 
there in San Diego - lots of them. That's 
when she got excited and told me about 
Movement. 

It would be a celebration of music and life 
in our quaint campus of UCSD. Ravers and 
non-ravers would meet, join in the music and 
groove together with a slew of big and small 
DJs - an electronic "We Are the World." Her 
excitement was gelling to her and the exhaus-
tion from the night before was sinking away 
at the thought of a happy, bumping Price Cen-
ter. I, however, had other thoughts. 

A rave on campus seemed like a pep rally 
in high school, all teeth and no bite. I asked 
her if she thought that this party could really 
happen. I told her that ravers were less than a 
minority on campus, and most of UCSD did-
n't really seem to care for us or the music. But 
she refused to give in and told me that the 

Thursday. January.28, 1iJ99 

people would come and the music would hold 
them. Again being cynical, } told her that 
techno really doesn't "hold" a lot of people. 
That's when she looked to me with a smile 
and said, "Electric Skychurch." } smiled back 
at her with that thought. 

If electronica can be considered as an 
established genre of music, The Electric Sky-
church might be viewed the same way the 
Beetles or Pink Floyd are in rock history. 
These groups don't create songs, they create 
albums. And although each individual track 
holds its own merit, the true magic lies in the 
tracks' cohesion and the overall theme of the 
album. 

Skychurch's first album Knowoneness 
integrated spoken word with their digital 
soundtrack. Thus many will argue that Sky-
church is not a "Techno" group at all, but the 
forefathers of electronica music. The sixth 
track "Radiate," which is also the soundtrack 
to this article, remains a spiritual and sexual 
favorite to rivers new and old. The track's 
infusion of trance, energy and visual aesthet-
ics creale a narrative about one's sensual 
search for music, and correspondingly, life. 

But their second album Together stands as 
the group's flasship in terms of musical and 
thematic talent. The first track is a nine 
minute digital romp, charged with an enthusi-
astic bass beat and a lucid female ¥Oice carry-
ing the melody through to the next track. 
Unlike Pink Floyd's [)arlcside of the Moon, 
Together does not blend tracks together as 
might be expected in DJ fashion. But the 
album does not lose any of its cohesion, pri-
marily because of a similar bass line in each 
track. The beat isn't bogged down with heavy 
bass. Instead, a light yet kinetic rhythm trav-
els through the whole album. And that's what 
the- album does for you - Together travels 
with you through the various emotions each 
track is designed to procure. Where many 
techno bands delve into darker issues of the 
psyche. Togetlwr emphasizes the positive 
nature of human beings. 

What is IROIt impressive of the Electric 
Skychurch is its ability to clearly bring about 
strong and distinct emotions without verbally 
describing them. When words are used in the 
fifth rack interlude, it is done by distorting the 
words, as if they are coming ' from a broken 
transmitter. A minister (it seems) is debating 
the existence of good and evil, light and dart-
ness. His voice is unclear and hard to recog-
nize. Unlike 'most albums where words are 
usually the most defining mechanism for dis-
tinct images. Skychurch reverses the process 
and blurs the importance of words (although 
their existence is significant), which makes 
the musical portion seem clearer and emo-
tionally distinct. 

The Electric Skychurch is not a ''Techno'' 
band in the most conventional of definitions. 
Together is an album without the complicated 
breakbeats that most techno tracks bear, so the 
sound is "friendlier"to those not familiar with 
techno. Each track has its own flavor, but also 
contributes to the overall positive tone and 
theme. It offers a different way to feel emo-
tions in our narcotic generation. 

With all this in mind, I thought that maybe 
the party would have a few kids all grooving 
to the same beats. Techno really wasn't that 
different from other forms of music, and the 
happy attitude of the culture might override 
the generally mundane feel of the campus. 

} came to the party late. Thousands of 
party kids, raver and non, were partying to 
vibrating speakers and dancing lights. They 
were celebrating music and each other. I 
thought of Kristi. I wanted to sing "We Are 
the World."

Despite the slightly off pitch

their way into the listener's head. 
At fi · ~ glance, James' new release,

nothing out of the ordinary. Yet, 
some of his latent vocal quality 
manages to eke through the lullaby 
lyrics and the sleepy musical set-

Party is the kind of music that peo-
ple hear while sitting in a comfort-
able chair in some obscure coffee 
shop. 

Drummer Michael Enzor and 
bassist Eric o'Connor (from the 
Magnetic Health Factory) provide 
the soporific mu.'iicality behind the 
mellow, rich voice of Alec James. 
Lines such as "I can wait for love 
forever/ I can take my timel But I 
can't wait to lose my mind," stand 
out among the sometimes drab 
lyrics. As long as the listener is 
content with only occasionally 
interesting lyrics, the rest of the 
album isn't half bad. 

Overall, The Quiet Party has 
great appeal as an alternAtive to the 
bubble-gum chewing, testosterone-

. deficient surge of the so-called 
''boy bands" that currently plague 
the radio stations of the world. The 
Quiet Party is best personified 
through its title - some people dig

Snowpony's The Slow-Motion 

World of Snowpony succeeds in 
proving that modem rock is finatly 
willing 10 take a step past "alterna-
tive" - well, at least in the United 
Kingdom. 

The album features many tradi-
tional elements of rock, but at the 
same time looks forward, eager to 
embrace a wide variety of music, 
not the least of which includes 
electronica. The liberal use of sam-
ples, some of the drum patterns and 

Snowpony is the brainchild of 
Katherine Gifford, who used to 
sing for the critically acclaimed 
Stereolab. Gifford, who sounds sort 
of like a blend between Shirley 
Manson of Garbage and that singer 
from Elastica, penned and sang all 
the tunes from the disc . 

The group blends an eclectic 
and unusual mix of samples into 
their songs, whose sources include 
everything from jazz to classical 
and spots in between, like bits from 
Sonic Youth, Nick Cave and noise 
effects reminiscent of '70. CD'-
toons. 

The live recorded music also 
draws from disparate sources, 
incorporating Hawaiian/country-
western steel guitar alongside sitar 
fills and break beats. but all more or 
less in the context of rock.

SHE MOST CERTAINLY IS NOT! 
Robert Iscoves 'Shes All Tbat'falls short of being a successful high school romance in nearly every respect 
By Jeremy Gray 
Senior Staff Writer 

More like an epi sode of "Saved 
By the Bell" than anything r<!sem-
bling a movie, "She's All That" is 
a high school fluff piece that suf-

fer~ from a lack of originality, 
lame character development and 
everything in between. 

Not to give away the entire plot 
- the mmt popu lar guy in schoo l 
Zaek (Freddie Prinlc . Jr.) gets 
dum ped by the mo~ t popuiar girl 
In schoo l l" :l t"r (Jodi Ly n 
O·Kedc l. and makes a betlllal h e 
can turn th~ an ll -sl)(.:i al La ney 
(Rachacl Leigh Cook) into the 
llrom que..:n. acci.dentally fa ll ing 
in love With her on the wa) . Actu-
all y, tbat is the whole plol. Well . 
that will save potential audiences 
,ome money. 

The prohlem with th is lilm is it 
ha~ no idea of what it wants to be. 
Tha..: arc momcnts that suggest it 
as a parody of high schoo l and 
Southern California culturc. One 
exa mple is when the JV football 
tea m - a soc ially higher caste -
is ordered to clean Laney's house. 
But just when the movie gears up 
to de li ver some social commen-
tary, it chickens out and settles 
back into its formulai c plot and 
weak character deve lopment. 
Watch as Zack woos Laney and an 
entire performing arts audience 

with a hackey sack! Cower as Ihe 
school bully eals pizza covered in 
pubic hairs! Yawn as you walk up 
10 the lickel boolh 10 ask for a 
refund! 

Not to say that a movie devol-
ed 10 a believahle high school 
romance is a had idea. The niche 
is there, but altempts to lill it arc 
oft en done in the most unbeliev-
ahl e, Aaron Spelling-ish ways. 
"She's All That" a lmo ~t delivers 
in the ca~ti ng of Cook a~ Laney 
Boggs. Her pe rfo rm ance alone 
would have saved the picture if it 
weren't for I1c l nilwi, supporting 
cast. 

Fi rst thcrc\ Dean (Paul Walk-
er. do ing his best itnpre~sion of 
Ian Ziering from 90210) as Zack's 
hest fri end whose two motivations 
in life arc to have sex and to win 
bets. It is hard work corning up 
with a charac ter in past movies 
that the audience cares Ie" about, 
and thai means everything about 
him. including hi s misuse of Ihe 
word. "beeatch ." 

Taylor is another forgellable 
character who is such a blalant 
exaggeration of the typical high 
school prom queen Ihat she 
resembles a cartoon. II 's like Ihe 
director forgot 10 let her read lhe 
script beforehand and instead told 
her. "OK, you're mean and you're 
popular. Go with il." 

Courtesy of Miramax Rims 
Clueless: Rachel Leigh Cook and Freddie Prince Jr. stare deep into each other's teenage eyes. 

There arc some notable excep-
tions. As Laney's father and 
owner of a pool cleaning compa-
ny, Kevin Pollock gives a sofl, 
supportive performance. And 
Kieran Culkin is . realislic as 
Laney 's brolher, ahhough hardly 
old enough 10 be going to Ihe 
same school. 

But far and above Ihe rest of 
Ihe cast is Cook. who's porlrayal 

of Laney is on Ihe money. She 
manages to waver between conli -
dent yet misunderslood 10 inse-
cure and frighlened . And unlike 
most actresses in a high school 
movie, she aclually looks and aclS 
like a real leenager. If only lhe 
rest of Ihe casl could relum Ihe 
favor. 

If "She 's All That" had focused 
in on Laney, Zack and Iheir 

respeclive families. it could have 
been a poignant high school 
romance framed in the Ihroes of 
teenage angst. Inslead, il comes 
off as a walered down 
comedy/drama Ihal is forever 
playing calch-up wilh Ihe far 
superior "Clueless." Whatever. 

"She's All That" was direcled 
by Roberl Iscove and opens 
nalionally on Jan. 29.

Road Trip Provides Wins 
BREAKOUT: UCSD scored three victories away from home this weekend 
ByJohn.,.... 
Sports Editor 

Last year's UCSD women's 
basketball team, a team chock full 
with eight upperclassmen and a full 
set of seasoned starters, finished its 
season playing remarkable team 
basketball, stringing together a 
countless number of wins. 

This year's team, 
though younger and 

improved the Tritons to 13-5 on the 
season and 10-2 in Division UI 
competition. 

The forerunner of this marked 
improvement during the Cal State 
Hayward game was senior guard 
Amy "Mac" McClure. Mac was 
unstoppable from outside the are, 
draining an amazing 5-6 three-

point attempts, en route to a 
team-best 17 points. 

"Mac had 

saw," Malone said. "She called the 
right shots." 

Senior guard Janessa Oayda and 
sophomore Kim Neal brought in 
solid performances against 
Hayward as well . Oayda scored 9 
points - including 2 three-poi nt-
ers,- and racked 3 rebounds. Neal 
also scored 9 points in just 13 min-
utes on the floor.

Overall, the weekend marked a 
great change in Triton team 
dynamics. 

ly working its way to 
such a caliber of play. 

The team's voyage up the coast 
this past weekend, in which it 
played three games in four days, 
was a strong ..proving ground for 
the Tritons. It gave them the oppor-
tunity to get a feel for where they 
are at this midpoint in the season. 
The Tritons are playing well, 
promising to improve even funher 
on their strong play. 

"We're near the level where we 
were playing last year," Head 
Coach Judy Malone said. 

Proof of this accolade comes 
from UCSD's three wins this 
weekend: the first, a 67-28 win 
over Mills College on Friday night; 
next, as 70-40 stomping over UC 
Santa Cruz; and finally, a win over 
Cal State Hayward, where the 
Tritons led 41-21 at halftime and 
never looked back, beating 
Hayward 76-58. 

Malone said it was during this 
game that the Tritons really gelled 
as a team. 

"There was a pan in the first 
half when we were really coming 
together," Malone said. "Th~y 
staned playing good basketball." 

Playing "good basketball" 

weekend," 
JUnior forward Marci 

Ernsberger said. "She played 
really well ." 

Though McClure had her most 
lucrative outing during Monday's 
Hayward match up, Malone said 
that the senior's breakthrough 
game was on Saturday against UC 
Santa Cruz. 

"'n the second half of the Santa 
Cruz game, Mac broke out of her 
slump," Malone said. "Out she also 
did well against Hayward." 

McClure's weekend energy 
seemed to rub off on the entire 
UCSD squad. Junior forward Kate 
Turnbull, who hasn't played her 
strongest offensively this season, 
really came alive in the Hayward 
game. Turnbull was a stellar 8-11 
from the field for 16 points. She 
also brought down a team-best 5 
rebounds. 

Senior point guard Tristen 
Teasdale also had a breakthrough 
weekend. Malone noted that 
Teasdale's vision of the court and 
awareness of opposing defenses 
allowed the Tritons to generate 
high-percentage shots. 

"Tristen Teasdale did a good job 
of reading the defenses and adjust-
ing the offense based on what she 

"It was a breakthrough week-
end," Malone said. "Players are 
starting to understand what's going 
on on the floor." 

Ernsberger expressed similar 
ideas about the Tritons'three-game 
weekend. 

"Overall, we really had a break-
through weekend," Ernsberger 
said. "We played to our ability. We 
played aggressive, stuffing and 
good team defense." 

After this weekend's trio of 
wins over Mills College, UCSC 
and Hayward, the Tritons are look-
ing ahead to Friday's Division IU 
match against Chapman 
University. 

This Chapman match holds 
strong postseason implications, 
however the Tritons have no reason 
to fear. They have been on the con-
stant path of improvement and 
have yet to peak. 

Malone said that she is happy 
with the team's progress to date 
and foresees improvement in the 
postseason. 

"Hopefully, we can improve to 
move forward," Malone said. 

The Tritons look to take their 
improving act far into the postsea-
son and the next big step is tomor-

,Tritons ' First :Triumph 
ACE: UCSD gets first win for first-year coach Eric Steidlmayer 
., ...... 
Senior Stllff ~er 

How somebody reacts in the face of adver-
sity is a real sign of that person's chancter. 
1be predators come back more hungry 
than before and the weak run away 
licking their wounds. When the 
members of the men's tennis 
team took on UC Riverside in 
their second match of the year 
at UCSD's north courts on Jan. 
22, they showed that they were 
predators. After being thoroughly beai-
en by Cal Poly Pomona in their opening 
match, the Tritons put up a strong perfor-
mance against Riverside and rolled to a final 
score of7-0. 

The Tritons swept all three doubles pro-
sets to take the doubles point, something that 
was a rare feat for the Tritons just a season 
ago. 

Steve Shabel and Joe Zerboni went down 
a break of serve early, but then rallied to win 
their No. I doubles match in a 9-8 tie break-
er. 

Brian Crain and Graeme Boushey put on 
an impressiveat No. 2 doubles performance, 
taking the pro-set, 8-3. 

"They played real well together," tirst-year 
Coach Eric Steidlmayer said. "They were real 
aggressive out there and basically dominated 
two good players." 

Mike Rosset and Ari Frankel had little 
trouble in their No. 3 doubles match, as they 
crushed their Riverside counterparts, 8-2 

UCSD's domination carried over into sin-
gles, where it won all six matches. 

No. I singles player Steve Shabel, who is 
ranked No. S in the nation in Division III and 
was an All-American IIISI year, had a ditlicult 
time but eventually won, 6-0, 2-6, 6-2. 

. "Steve's concentration is not where it 
needs to be," Steidlmayer said of his star. "He 
let the guy back in during the second set and 
then turned it up again in the third." 

Junior transfer Joe Zerboni, who sat 
out durin, the match against 

Pomona. won his match at No. 2 
singles, 2-6, 6-3, 6-2. Zerboni 
was nervous during the first set, 
but eventually settled into his 

game and came out on top. 
Senior Ping Yeh, who sat out last 

season, had a tough first set that he even-
tually won, 7-S, before cruising to a 6-0 vic-
tory in the second set of his match. 

Mike Rosell had a difficult No. 4 singles 
match against an opponent who seemed 
stronger than Riverside's No.2 and No. 3 
players. Rosell came out smoking in the 
first set and won, 6-0, before dropping the 
second set, 4-6. The third set was a real bat-
tle, in which Rosell eventually triumphed, 
7-S. 

Boushey had little trouble at No. 5 singles, 
easily defeating his opponent, 6-1, 6-2. 
Freshman Ari Frankel was dominant at No. 6 
singles, cruising to a 6-1, 6-4 victory. 

The victory runs the Triton's record to an 
even I-Ion the young season. The team is 
off until Feb. S, when it begins a three-day 
tournament at the University of San Diego. 
The Tritons will resume their regular match-
es Feb. 9 at United States International 
University. 

This Tritons are focuserl on the task at 
hand, but have the annual war with Redlands 
University on their mind. The Tritons, who 
have lost to Redlands 3-4 for three consecu-
tive years, say they are looking forward to 
another chance to take out their arch neme-
sis.

GeronllllO: A hang glider pilot begins his descent over the cliffs of Torrey Pines Glider Port. 

est of campus. out past

UCS D is si tuated at the

air that the glider is flying through is mov-
ing in an upward direction faster than the 
glider is descending through the air, it will 
experience a net gain in altitude. 

When a glider gains altitude by riding 
tbe uprising air along steep diffs, it is tak-
ing advantage of ridge lift. If the wind that 
produces this lift is steady, a glider pilot

can stay airborne indetinitely by using the 
ridge-lift phenomenon to gain altitude. 

One of the top-rated Ilying sites in 
North Amerit:a, the tall difTs and steady 
winds at Torrey Pines attract pilots from 
around the world. 

"Often, they get the feeling it 's like 
Mect:a," said David Jebb. manager of the 
Glider Pon. "If you don't tly Torrey Pines. 
you won ' t go to heaven." 

A de~ignated hiMoric site, the Glider 
Port has been in w ntinuous operation since 
1928. The first flyers at Torrey Pines used 
conventi onal gliders, one- or two-scat 
planes that are like gcneral aviation air-
planes, but with longer wings and no 
engines. During these early years, gliders 
were pulled aloft from the runway by large 
winches, or towed into the air behind 
speeding automobiles. 

During the I 970s, the flying emphasis at 
Torrey Pines shifted toward the new hang 
gliders, which has a number of advantages 
over conventional gliders. A hang glider is 
a simpler, less expensive aircraft than a 
conventional glider. It can be launched 
without winches or towing equipment, and 
if the wind dies and the pilot must land on 
the beach below, the hang glider can be t:ar-
ried back up to the cliff top with compara-
tive ease. 

Hang gliding is distilled flight : All that 
is unnecessary has been eliminated. 

Suspended beneath the wing, the pilot is 
exposed 10 the elements. The experience is 
unmarred by a screaming engine or crat:k-
ling radio. and the pilol hears only the wind 
passing by as he flies. Instead of a compli-
cated instrument panel and wntrols for 
dozens of systems, a hang-glider pilot has 
only a single, moving bar. The hang glider 
is 10 a regular airplane what a surfboard is 
to a cabin cruiser. 

During the I 980s, another type of flying 
machine appeared at Torrey Pines: the 
paraglider. Similar to conventional skydiv-
ing equipment, paragliders use large, spe-
cially shaped parachute canopies that are 
optimized for forward tlight. The paraglid-
er pilot controls the craft by using two han-
dles, which shorten or lengthen cables that 
are attached to the t:anopy and change its 
shape. Even smaller than a hang glider, an 
entire paraglider can be stored in a large 
backpack or the trunk of a car. They are 
simpler to operate and slower than hang 
gliders, and can generally fly in less wind. 

Paragliders are now the most common 
craft seen flying at Torrey Pines, sharing 
space with hang gliders and remote-con-
trolled model planes. 

There is a long list of requirements that 
must be satisfied before a pilot can tly an 
aircraft at the Glider Port. Torrey Pines is 
classified as a United States Hang Gliding 
Association Advant:ed Site. Up to 50 air-
t:faft may be airborne along the dift's on a 
good day, all looking for the same lift. 
Although hang glider and paraglider pilots 
are not required by the government to be 
licensed, most tlying sites require pilots to 

- be certified before allowing them to fly. 
Still, most pilots agree that the expense 

(hang glider prices begin at around $1,(00) 
and regulations are well worth the experi-
ence. 

While flying, a pilot experiences a level 
of ultimate freedom not · normally found on 
the ground. Soaring above the cliffs on a 
strong updraft, with the water below and 
the sky above, the pilot is independent from 
the world, immersed in an environment of 
sublime beauty and simplicity. It is perhaps 
this quality of flying that is hardesl to con-
vey 10 someone who has never left the 
ground. It cannol be explained, only expe-
rienced. 

SceIIIc: Bystanders gaze out over the Pacific as a hang glider rides the "ridge lift" created by the large cliffs of Torrey Pines.
