UC Regents Endorse New Standards 
HIGH SCHOOL: Math 
and English standards 
will be voluntary 

between what hi gh - ~cho()1 graduates 
know and what they need to know, lOp 
education official s, including C 
President Richard Atkinson and State 
Superintendent of Punlic Instruction 
Dclalile Eastin. set up the California 
Education Round Tahle lasl year {o 
draft a new set ofcontent -ba 'edgradu-
ation standards. 

"It 's really lime for us to mo ve 
the har up," Eastin said. 

" It is loopy to ha ve vo luntary 
~Iandards . " she said . " It is abso-
lutel imperati ve that these become 
mandaLory . " 

By Terry Lew 
News Editor 

The ultimate goal of the new 
standards, according to the proposal , 
is to prepare greater numhers of 
high-~chool graduates for college or 
the workforce. 

The quality of a high-school edu-
cation vllries widly across the state. 
due in part to local school di ·tricts 

~elting theirowngrllduati on require-
ments. 

SAN FRA CISCO - The UC 
Board of Regents enthusiastically 
endorsed Thursday a proposal for 
rai sing California ' s hi gh-school 
graduati on standards, although the 
unofficial vote has no teet h and must 
he taken again nex t month. 

Recogniling the growing chasm 

The new standards, which would 
be vo luntary, woulu place less em-
phas i ~ on the time spent in class in 
favor of comprehensive instruction 
in both fundamentals and practi ca l 
:Ipplicat ions. 

Instead or prescribing which 
courses students mu~ttake and which 
hooks Ihey must read. the slandards 
deline what students should know 
hy the time the graduate. 

Howe ver, the optional nallire of 
Ihe standards was a thorn III Ea~lIn ' ~ 
~ ide . 

"There arc forces that really want 
lodiluteeducalionand make it easier," 
Eastlll said . " 11' we cou ld begin to 
drive in thi s direction. it would send a 
po\\erfu Illle~~age across Cal i fomia ."

phy~i c~ cour~es . 
Ro~e nhluth also worked with Edward Teller in 

1950 as one of the principle Iheoreticians at the 
Los Alamos Scienti lic Laboratory in New Mexico. 
HIS contribution to class ified fusion re~e,lfch led 
to the development of the hydrogen homb in the 
next two years. 

Rosenhluth later jOllled a small group of e~­
teemed scien tists headed hy James Turk to inve~­

Baha ' i club ~ p()n~o red the lirst annua l World 
Peace Rece pt ion last Thursday. 

Between 30 and 40 ~ Iudents attended the 
event. which included performances hy Ihe 
Mona Work~h{)p from Mcxicali , Mexico 
and a free international dinner. All student 
organiLlItion~ on campus were invited to 
partici pate in the event , hut on ly live cluhs 
~C nL representatives. 

The cluh members were invited to the 
recept ion so they could speak about the 
reasons the cluhs were founded, as well a~ 
their views on world peace. Marshall junior 
Navid Serrano, a memberofthe Baha' i club, 
said the poor altendance was nol due to lack 
of en thusiasm, but rather inefficient com-
munication. 

'Tm not really disappointed with the 
lack of altcndance by the groups because we 
weren' t sure about how to invi te them," he 
~aid . "We emailed and called all the groups, 
hut Ihe representatives who showed up were 
pcople that we had known personally." 

errano also noted that the Baha' i club 
was already planning for nex t year's recep-
lion. 

"From now on, we wou ld like to make 
thc World Peace Reception it collaborative 
effort with other studen t organilations -
the Hindu Students group was very enthusi-
astic and supportive abou t that," he said . 

The Religious Studies Club, Muslim Stu-
dent Association, Persian Club and Hindu 
Student Council sent members to the con-
ference. Associated tudents representative 
Guy Mount , speaking for the Muslim Stu-
dent Association, greeted participanb with 
an ancient Mu~lim greeting of peace. 

"We say thi !) phra~e, which means • Peace 
he unto you,' constant ly each day to each 
other," he said. "The whole goal of I s laml~ 
peaceful ~ubmi ssion to the will o I' God, and 
if we follow God we will attam world peace."

In the mood for Mexican? Or maybe 

a Papa Kahuna's individual pizza? How 
about a submarine sandwich or a l!rilled 
chicken breast sandwich? Whatever you're in the 
mood for, I'm certain YOU can satisfy your tummy'S 
temptations by indull!inl! in any of the wide variety 
of tantilizinl!ly tasty dishes at the Rathskeller. 

Bob and I had lunch there yesterday after a failed 
attempt at learninl! to surf. Bob had the bodacious 
chicken bistro sandwich, which he found absolutely 
delectable, and yummY crinkle<ut french fries, I 
had a ereat bill ham and turkey submarine sandwich 
that was jam-packed with crazy vel!l!ies, includinl! 
my favorite - avocado slices! Wowza! I also enjoyed 
a l!reat bill blue raspberry frozen l!ranita and almost 
l!ave myself a brain freeze. Whoopsy-POOPSY! Bob 
and I shared one of those famous l!iant chocolate 
chip cookies too, they're dreamy! The Rathskeller 
has somethinl! for everYone. and it's so convenient! 
So why don't YOU pop on by for an extra-fantabulous 
breakfast, lunch. or dinner!

Athenas Strike Tritons 
HARDCOURT: UCSD dropped to 1-2 on the cason with a narrow 5-4 loss to Claremont 
By Sean Rahim! 
Sports Editor 

When you think or 11111 ~ica l I.:hairs, YOll 
think of little kids frnlicking around, Slfucc/.ing 
into chai rs while Ihe leacher ~ t a rt s and ~ tof1' Ihe 

cassette player. But when Ithink 
of mU~lCal I.: hai rs, I th ink of 
Triton Head Coach LII. 
LaPlanle and the women's ten-
ni s team. 

Moving players around and 
shifting line-ups is necessary in 
the early slages of Ihe season. 
Consequently, LaPlante makes 

adjustmenls every match ,IS the women follow 
along in this gilme of musical chairs. 

TIle 1997 season has been no di ITerent, with 
linc-upl.:hanges in cal.:h of the firstthrcc matches. 
The adjustmenls. however, were not enough 10 
gel past the AthenasofClaremont Mudd Scripps 
Saturday morning. UCSD' s record dropped to 
1-2 on the 1997 campaign, as it lost a heart-
breaking 5-4 contest at the Northview Tennis 
Courts. 

-They ' ve probably got the loughest team 
t hat they havc ever had:' LaPlante said. "We' re 
very young and experienced. but I think it 
could have goneeilher way. Wejust needtogct 
some matl.:hes under our belt ." 

laremonl Mudd Scripps came out strong, 
taking two points in the li rst stage of the conte t 
by notl.:hing doubles victories at the No. I and 
3 slots. The Athenas' duo of Julie Kirkpatrick 
and Rosie Cella oUl-gunned the niton tandem 

of SliC Huhcml:Jn and Jen nifer DrilTllTler, X-3, 
willie Allison Mi/.uo and Michelle MI.:Vey 
handled Kaala I'Ola~ hni l.:k and Kelly T~ul by 
thl! , ame scorc. 

UCSD's No. 2 team of Maria Nguyen and 
Stephanie Herbert , however, salvaged the laM 
dOli hies pOint hy taking the pm set frol11 
Katherine Miko l aiti~ and Michelle Parent i hy 
a tally of 8-5. Down 5-4, and 15-40 in the set, 
Nguyen and Herhcrt tumed il on, wi nning the 
next four games With strong serves and accu-
rate vo lleys. Nguyen finished out Ihe set with 
a scorl.:hing hal.: khand relum past a diving 
Mikolai tis forthedoubles point, keeping UCSD 
from going into the singles portion down 3-0. 

"INguyen and Herbert 's winl definitely 
helped," LaPlante added. "Going into single 
down 3-0 would have killed us. They played 
real welltogethcr:' 

Down 2- 1 going into singles. the Tritons 
needed to gnlb fourofthe six remaining points 
to eke oul a 5-4 victory, but came up one 
singles match short. Captain and lone senior 
Hubennan went up against a tough Mizuo at 
the No. I slot. Hubenllan tried everything from 
changing speeds to drop shots, but in the end 
Mizuo had a bellerday, taking the poinl, 6-1, 6-
I. Nguyen '!nd Herbencarricd overtheirstrong 
doubles play into their si ngles matches at the 
No. 2 and No. 3 slols. respectively. 

Aflertaking the lirst set against Rosie Cella, 
6-4, Nguyen losl her concentration and con-
ceded the next set, 0-6, but regained her poi e 
and stroke - eventually holding off Cella in 

Mark Patterson/ Guarolan 

Forehand: Captain Sue Huberman 
winds up for a southpaw groundstroke, 
Ihe third set, 7-6 to gamer the point. Herbert 
blew Parenti away at the No.3 slot with strong 
groondstrokes and an overpowering se ~v il.:e 
game, 6-4, 6-3. 

Potashnick and Tsui found tougher ti mes at 
the No. 4 and 5 lots, respectively. MI.:Vey 
notched a point for the Athenas with a 6-4, 6-3 
win over POlashnid. whi le Kirpatrick followed 
suit at the NO. 4 slot with a 6-2, 7-6 score. 

UCSD's Becky Jones garnered the fourth 
Triton point al the No. 6 singles slot with a 
commanding 6-4, 6-0thr'l~hing of Stacey Fong.

~ic k Alice Hus/.e/ , stef1l"lCU uf1 her game with 12 
blol.:ked ~hols in the malch. Senior Shawna 
Caballcro, worki ng hard at hole SCi , scored a 
goal in the quarter when ~ hc wa, fouled fighling 
for pOSi lion. To gel the hall li ve. she passed the 
hall out to the f1eri meter and was i mmediatcly 
passed b,ll"k 10. She wa~ tcd no time in llif1ping 
the ball into the hack-oflhe nellO givc the Triton~ 
their fir,t score of Ihe game. 

Despite the brilliant effort of Hadiashar, Ihe 
Gauchos ~ till managcu to score twicc in the 
second quarter. Her play wa~ hig.hlighted hya 
UCSB possession in which Ihe Gauchos' Al i 
Rosenbaum beal Caballero to the net and took a 
shot from aooultwo meters away with onl y the 
UCSD goa lil! in her path. Her shol went above 
Hadiashar 's head, but surely would have sl.:orcd 
had the young Triton goalie not slretl.: hed high 
into the air to make an impressive save. 

"Wilh Altce sick, Maryann really had lo step 
it up," Harper said. " Today, she made a statc-
mentthat she should be the goa lie: ' 

In the third quaner, the Tritons swanning 
defense allowed on ly one goal. while Caballero 
scored another of her own with an assist from 

fr~shman Anne Cannon . Receiving the entry 
pass 31 hole set with her right hand. she switched 
to her left and lired a winner past the Gaucho 
goalie. 

Adding to action in the fourth quarter, Can-
non scored a goal on a six -on-five opponunity 
wi th the ejected player still swimming out of 
bounds. Sophomore Kathryn Ozaki also scored 
on a six-on-live_ but the Tritons cou ld not come 
lip wilh any more offense as the quaner ended. 

Allowing one goal in the second half, the 
Tritons improved dramatically defensively from 
the lir~ t to ScI.: nd quarter. But they arc slill 
having trouble crealing shots-a nd getting the ball 
to their interior players. 

'-We arc a really yo ung team:' junior Kelly 
Gilbreth . aid . "The staning linc-up is baskally
