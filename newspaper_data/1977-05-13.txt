Vol. 31, No. IS 

Nighttime 
Offers New 
. VIeW of ZCXJ 

by Alan Russell 
News Editor 

In a setting of darkness, a light 
wind gently sweeping the 
overhanging tendrils of 
eucalyptus, the sound begins. 
Starting slowly, then climbing a 
foreign musical scale, the noise 
emerges as a derisive cacaphony, 
its echoes trailing our footsteps. 
Nearby we observe a large beast 
prowling, its eyes glowing in a 
caliginous _ blanket, its troubled . 
paces seeming to keep in time with 
the animal chorus. At last the 
orchestra ends, and I tum to BiU 
Eilers-nighttime security guard 
for the San Diego Zoo, and say: 
"That's a sound right out of a 'B' 
Tar-Lall movie." 

Somehow, though, those movies 
never sent shivers down my spine. 

Eilers laughed and nodded. "I 
call that making commWlication," 
he said. 

With that we continued Eilers' 
rounds- Laura Richter, a fellow 
Triton Times reporter, l-and the 
animals. It is 9:30 pm. The tour has 
been in progress four and a half 
hours, from the Zoo's closing time, 
and still it seems, despite wide 
eyes and active questions, we've 
hardly scratched the surface of 
wonders that the locked bars of the 
Zoo have to reveal. 

Driving surely around in a Dart 
Custom without lights, trailing the 
curves in darkness, Eilers, a 
seven-year zoo night security 
guard, one of two who work the 
3:00 pm to 11:30 pm shift, talks 
steadily with his combination 
midwestern/Colonel Sanders 
Voice. " Yeah, things go in pat-
terns. Some nights the wolves howl 
and others they don't. Most of the 
animals have adjusted to a 
daytime routine, but some still 
wait for the night to become ac-
tive." 

A 25-year Marine veteran, Eilers 
comes across as two personalities: 
the first sergeant and an amiable 
grandfather type (he is) . His 
crewcut is appropriate for the 
warm spring evening-something 
he is quick to boast about. 
Following him about in his job one 
feels the pride he takes in working 
it.

Legislators Ask End to UC 
Lecturer n8_ year up-and-out" 

UCSanDlego 

Friday, May 13, 1977 

by Hugh McIntosh 
Sacramento Correspondent 

SACRAMENTO - University of 
California lecturers who would not 
be rehired because of the "Eight-
Year, Up-or-out" rule can draw 
some hope from a measure ap-
proved in the State Legislature 
yesterday. 

The Assembly Ways and Means 
Subcommittee on Education ap-
proved an amendment to the 1977-
78 state budget asking the 
University of California to renew 
one-year contracts of all lecturers 
affected by the eight-year rule 
while it is being evaluated by the 
University. 

According to the eight-year rule, 
lecturers cannot be rehired after 
teaching at UC a specified number 
of years, usually eight. About five 
percent of the Universi!y's 1,500 
lecturers have been granted 
tenure-like security of employment 
and are exempt from the rule. 

In requesting the University to 
evaluate the eight-year rule, the 
subcommittee asked it to consider 
eliminating the rule, retaining and 
promoting lecturers on merit and 
facilitating the movement between 
the ranks of lecturers and 
professors. 

Archie Kleingartner, UC vice 
president for academic and staff 
personnel relations, said, at 
Monday's hearing, that the 
University has already appointed a 
committee to study the rule. The 
committee will make its report 
early next year. 

Kleingartner said he has " very 
~ deep concern" about renewing the 
e contract of lecturers affected by 

a:J the eight-year rule. New lecturers 
have already been recruited to 
replace those being terminated 
this year, and all 1,500 lecturers 
'~ might interpret the renewal clause

lIStayville" at the Mandevi lie 
Jazz Musical Premieres Here Wednesday 

The Mandeville Auditorium 
will be the site of a world 
premiere next Wednesday, when 
"Storyville," a musical about the 
orgins of jazz, opens. 

"Storyville" centers on the 
lives of jazz musicians who lived 
in the "Back 0' Town" section of 
New Orleans at the turn of the 
century. The plot centers on the 
events preceding the actual 
shutting down of the "Back 0' 
Town" section, which was the 
location of America's first ex-
periment with legalized vice as 
well as the birthplace of New 
Orleans jazz. 

The cast, which will include 
professional actors as well as 

UQm drama students, features 
Broadway actress Ernestine 
Jones, who has played in "Guys 
and Dolls", "Hello Dolly" and 
" Raisin" . 

The script for "Storyville" was 
written by playwright Ed Bullins, 
recipient of the New York Drama 
Critics Circle Award for his play 
"The Taking of Miss Janie", 
presented by the drama 
department here earlier this 
year. Composer Mildred Kayden, 
who wrote the music and lyrics 
for the production, has written 
scores for a number of Broadway 
and off-Broadway musicals. 

UCSD drama professor Floyd 
Gaffney is directing "Storyville," 

with choreographer Jaime 
Rogers , who has done 
choreography for television and 
danced with the Martha Graham 
company and with Jerome 
Robbins. Music Professor Cecil 
Lytle will direct the music for the 
show, which is being co-
sponsored by the music and 
drama departments. 

"Storyvill " will run from next 
Wedne day through May 22. 
Performances begin at 8 p.m., 
with one matinee performance at 
2 p.m., on May 21. Tickets cost 
$2.50 for tudents , $4.50 for non-
students and are available at th 
UCSD theatre ticket office on 
Matthew campus. 

charged that the University hires 
lecturers and then terminates 
them before they can get security 
of employment. Their positions are 
filled by other lecturers who are in 
turn terminated and replaced he 
said. 

Kleingartner replied that the 
" overwhelming majority" of 
lecturers are replaced by regular 
faculty and not by other lecturers. 

UC Vice President Chester 
McKorkle said granting security of

Summer 
Campus Health 
Care Curtailed 

UCSD students who have been in 
the habit of becoming ill during the 
summer and receiving free 
treatment at the Health Services 
office, are now advised to sign up 
for several classes during the 
summer quarter. 

Assistant vice-chancellor of 
Student Affairs Rick Whitehill 
announced Wednesday that, for the 
first time, only currently 
registered students will be allowed 
to take advantage of the free health 
services. 

" It isn't something we wanted to 
do," Whitehill said, " but budget 
restrictions made it mandatory." 

He added that non-registered 
students will be able to use the 
facilities in emergency cases only, 
and will " probably be charged 
some kind of a discounted fee."

Gruanoll PoUtlc:l 
People eotend the Glendale Federal community room in amall groupe 

talking quietly among tbemlelves. Specifieally, tbey came to ~ 
metboda to elect the Pacific Beach Community Planning Committee, 
whleb wUllmplement the PB Cooununity Plan. Generally they came to 
engage in the ancient ritual of ccmmunity politic.-other1rise known as 
government by concerned citizen. 

This group rI. about 50 people crowded in the small room recently was 
divided into two factions, which could be loosely (and somewhat inac-
curately) labeled as business-supporters and residenta. The tension 
between the two factions was evident from the start. 

You see, at the last meeting, on April 14, a contingent rI. business people 
entered and voted in a slate of business people, deposing the aisting slate 
of officers, who represented residential interests that have virtually 
controlled the PB Ad Hoc Planning Group since its Inception in 1971. The 
business people also approved a plan for electing members rI. the im-
plementation group, which guarantees business five seats, with 13 
members to be elected residents and two selected to represent "special 
intetests" (the 13-5-2 plan) . This plan replaced a plan to elect all 7Al 
members in open voting. 

The only hitch with all this was that the election-being unscheduled-
was unpublicized. There has since been much debate over whether an 
unpubUcized vote is legal. 

So the room was filled with people, most of them long involved with PB 
politics a nd fa miliar with each other. That familiarity added a special 

• flav~r to t he animosity between them. They clashed throughout the night, 
playlOg out the act as they had so often in the past. 

The A~ril 14 el~ction came up immediately, when a middle-aged 
wo~n, 10 a 9uestlOn, referre~ to the election as " a coup." A balding 
busmessman Jumped up to object and another business man swore the 
election was spontaneous, not planned. 

Was the April 14 e lection a coup? Agreement will never be reached but 
let's take a shot at answering the question. The fact that many ~ore 
business people attended the meeting than usual may not have been the 
result of complete organization. But the election had all the eannarks of a 
coup-it was silent, bloodless and total. 

An a rgwnent over labeling the April 14 meeting is mere semantic 
quarreling. What is important is that bus iness interests siezed control of 
the PB planning mechanism , in one more skirmish in a confrontation 
which has become classic over the past decade . Both business and 
residents think the other is out to get them . Business people feel they 
must have guaranteed representation or they will be screwed. They don't 
believe t hey would be picked in an open election. 

Bu~ that ideal has little historical validity. Ocean Beach held open 
electIOns last year to select its planning committee and its residents-
certainly more liberal than middle class PB-elected a group which is 40 
percent business . As for PB itself, in 1971 a n ad hoc council was selected 
which consisted primarily of residents. Business has hardly withered in 
PB since then. 

And if busi~ess should have a guarantee on 25 percent of the PB group, 
why s houldn t ot her segments of the community be guaranteed 
representation? PB is about 60 percent renters and 25 percent senior

Election Panel Loses Credibility 
I would like to express some 

rather profound misgivings I feel 
about the series rI. decisions 
rendered by the Election Su~ 
committee following the recent 
ASUCSD elections, regarding the 
statua rI. candidates Steve Grady 
and Laura Kerl. The subcommittee 
demonstrated clearly in the case rI. 
at least one stipulated campaign 
regulation concerning the filing of 
campaign expenditure statements 
by April 22 that it was ultimately 
unconcerned with adherence to the 
regulation , at least in the cases of 
Kerl and Grady. 

This was manifested by an-
nouncing the decision of April 26 to 
disqualify Grady and Kerl from 
their respective presidential and 
academic affairs runoffs based on 
violations of the regulation, 

. followed on May 3 by the resolution 
that allegations of deadline 
violations were " true, but not 
substantial. " This rather 
flagranUy counters statements 
made in the Triton Times, April 27, 
representing the views of David 
Ernst, administrative represen-
tative of the subcommittee, in 
defense of the regulation, to the 
effect that failure to turn in 
statements of expenditure 
prevented audits for some can-
didates which required the ap-
propriate action of 
disqualification. 

The abrogation of this stand 
within the week seems an awkward 
course at best for such an essential 

. 

organ of the smooth transition of 
governments. Indeed, such a path 
tends to undennine any credibility 
that the transition and its goals still 
command in the students, faculty 
and administration of UCSD. 

In addition, I would especially 
like to express disappoinbneot 1D 
the reward of the irresponsible 
neglect of the deadline on the part 
of the two candidates with a 
guarantee of impunity, and a re-
instatement a.s runoff candidates. 
In seeking election, both Grady 
and Kerl would certainly wish to be 
considert'd responsible persons, 
conscious of student needs and of 
campus events. 

YSA Commentary 

I would suggest the expedience 
of consulting the Triton Times 88 
one,of many essentiallndicaton of 
such evenbl. Had they done 80 
April 7Al they migbt bave happened 
00 an article entitled "ASUCSD 
Voting Begins Today," wbich 
apparently successfully reminded 
all of the other candidates- to "rue 
complete statements of how they 
spend their campaign funds by 
Friday afternoon." (Triton Times, 
April 7Al) It certainly couldn't hurt 
an ASUCSD officer to be aware of 
what's going on.

"How We Got the Vote" 
by the Young ~iaUat AlUaDce 

The documentary How We Got tbe Vote will be shown Wednesday night 
at 7:30 in the north conference room of the Student Center. Narrated by 

~ean ~plet?" , the film weaves historical commentary, contemporary 
mtel'Vlews WIth veteran suffrage leaders and dramatic photographs of 
the. suffrage movement. The film, sponsored by the Young Socialist 
Alliance and the Feminist Coalition, is an inspiring political account of 
the century-long battle to win the vote. 

How We Got the Vote tells the truth about the obstacles that stood in 
women's way, in particular the Democratic and Republican parties. For 
years, both Congress and successive presidents blocked the federal 

ame.ndme~t to enfranchise women, despite the rising tide of prosuffrage 
sentiment 10 the country. How We Got tbe Vote makes it clear that suf-
frage won only because women decided to build their own movement, 
independent of the two capitalist parties, despite pressures and harsh 
repression from the government. 

Women finally won the vote on August 26, 1920. Today the passage of the 
Equal Rights Amendment looks bleak, although it was first introduced 
into Congress fifty years ago. How We Got the Vote documents a political 
lesson. Today's womens' movement stands on the shoulders of the suf-
frage movement. The film is a valuable educational 8nd inspirational 
tool. See it Wednesday in the north conference room. There will be an 
informal discussion with members of the Young Socialist Alllance. Coble 
and discuss with us the roots of womens' oppreaion and the strategy of 
the womens' movement.

citizens. Carried to its logical 
conclusion, the 13-5-2 plan runs into 
problems which would dwarf thOlle 
encountered at the 1972 NLtional 
Democratic Convention. 

Not that this logic meant much to 
a majority of thOlle at the meeting. 
After an hour-and-a-half of 
passionate arguing, Dan 
MacKinnon, symbol rI. today's rich 
PB business (who appropriately 
sat next to ex-Mayor Frank 
Curran, a tried old hack who 
symbolizes the sixties ' love 
relationship between San Diego 
business and government) 
proposed a "more progressive 
step" -a modification which still 
provided for the 13-5-2 plan. 

Theyvoted.The1~2planwo~ 
24-19. 

Now, the obligatory analysis. 
The PB group's resemblance to the 
long lost Coop was 80 strong it 
struck me immediately. The group 
is totaUy open-anyone can talk and 
vote. It is a liWe more restrained, 
but I behavior is still ruled by 
ideological a iI personal 
animosity. Just as in the Coop, both 
sides consider the other to be 
completely off-the-wall : the 
conflict is between two absolutes, 
black and white, with no shades of 
gray. 

The switch from open election to 
a 13-S-2 plan was also so Coop. If 
you don't like something, stack the 
next meeting and change it. Who 
knows, maybe 75 residents will get 
together for the next meeting and 
change everything again.

Whitehill estimated that "some

save us about $50,000. We could use 
that to increase other student 
services or keep the fees down."

The Assistant Vice-chancellor

conjunction with Howard Hunt, the 
acting Vice-<:hancellor an dean of 
student affairs. "Also, the reg fee

The Zoo Storr ...

'''It's true, love the job," he said. "Working this 
shift I feel lib I'm my own boss. You've got to be 
able to do anything 011 this jolHmprcwiae and make 
any decision you feel necessary. A couple of Sundays 
ago there wu a bl8 water leak. I'm not much of a 
p1wnber, bull was able to stop it." 

Over the years on the job Eilers has had such other 
"unique" ~ as getting animals back in their 

"That polor bear just doesn'/ like to be cooped up . .. 

triton times . 

enclosures, removing large fallen trees which have 
come down during stonns and running off 
trespassers. 

"Actually, we don't get that many unwanted 
visit.ors," he said. "I've only bad one close caD. 
Happened back in Noyember of '69. I came upcn 
some yOWlg recruits. One guy had a bayonet and 
tried to get me with it. He misled and they both took 
off. They got away." 

Following Eilers on his rounds we found his early 
boast of "I love to walk" to be true. Estimating that 
he walks between five and ten miles a night, he says 
"it (the job) keeps an old codger in shape." 
Basically Eilers' work involves, in addition to 
keeping an "overall" watch, checking the locks on 
all the animal cages and touring the numerous zoo 
buildings to make sure everything is "as it should 
be ." 

ZooatNlPt 
And so how is the Zoo at night? While walking 

about one encounters a whole new range of sen-
sations, ones that are at great variance with the 
daytime Zoo. It is seemingly a more "natural" 
place, one in which throngs of people are not 
scurrying by, where the smells of popcorn, peanuts 
and hot dogs don't permeate the air, an atmosphere 
devoid of the noise pollution ofliitle children crying 
and loud-voiced anthropomorphic statements. In 
short, U's not the human Zoo everyone knows. 

What we find , under the half moon, are animals-
animals that look at you, note your presence, 
become alarmed at your motions, instead of never 
noting your existence. You are on a one-to-one level 
with .wild cats that pace and react to your person. 
You are the cause of the brown hyenas' pointed 
growls and bared teeth, the hippos' balesome stares, 
and the monkeys ramming the cages. You are the 
intruders.

closeness, because of the proximity to the animals. 
"I respect their wildness though," said Eilers. 
"You'd be a fool If you didn't." 

While visiting the cages Eilers maintains a con-
stant chatter. He has names for almost aU of the 
animals. and tries to calm them as we approach. 
"They're used to me, but not you," he explaiDed. 
"We've had other niglj visitors, doctorS doing 
studies, anthropologists doing research and the like, 
but nobody's ever toured with 'me. That's why 
they're skittish." 

AnImals Uke the Night 
Eilers paused a moment after this speech, then 

said philosophically: "I think they like the evening 
when people aren't here. They're alone to them-
selves and have time to get out of the public eye. 
There are times when we get a pretty bad breed of 
people. The roughest day is probably Saturday when 
parents leave 13 and 14 year old kids and YOWlger, to 
wander about by themselves all day. You get the 
poking sticks and thrown rocks then." . 

Each night many of the animals are locked up in 
spaces behind their enclosures, so as to keep them 
better "contained. II Food is the lure which gets them 
in from the enclosure (most nights-sometimes it's 
not enough enticement and they stay out), but once 
locked in some of the animals vehemenUy express 
their displeasure. As we walked along the bear cages 
checking the locks we came closer and closer to a 
loud din that had been resounding around the Zoo the 
entire evening. 

"That polar bear just doesn't like to be cooped 
up," said Eilers. We watched, through a small door 
opening in a side of metal, while a thick white paw 
struck out, smashing the steel. forcing it outward. 
" Just doesn't like it," reiterated Ellers. Wham! 
Wham! Wham! We moved a litUe more quickly 
down the asphalt path. 

While checking the locks of other bear cages, 
Eilers, a raconteur of the first sort, kept us en-
tertained with his long collection of stories. "Yeah, 
this is a friendly old brown bear. See this cage? It 
used to not extend all the way up, and old Brownie 
could reach over. I warned a guy that I was teaching 
the ropes of the job to that Brownie would reach over 
and tap him on the shoulders at night, you' know, 
friendly like, if he didn't watch out. Well, wouldn't 
you know it, he came in the day after his first night 
solo and said, ' Bil~ that bear tapped me on the 
shoulder. I swear I just about turned white.' You see, 
the man was black." 

I asked Eilers if he was, or had ever been scared or 
lonely on the job, which caused him to laugh slighUy. 
" No, I've got enough animals to talk to, II he said. 
" This kind of job gets some people jwnpy, what with 
the sounds of peacocks and chickens and everything 
else always rustling about, but I really love it. It took 
some getting used to though. II 

Lights 00 the Hill 
Surveying the area around us I pondered 'his 

words. My vision was assaulted on several fronts-
from the jwnping shadows (caused by the odd 
fragments of light ), to the bizarre sight of the 
heating lamps silhouetted against a high hill and 
overhanging black sky. The last sight, not an un-
corrunon one on our zoo wanderings, as many species 
need more warmth than San Diego evenings can 
afford , continually had me stopping to stare . The 
pulsing red glow, casting ruby phosphorous images 
about, was a sight to make eyes sore. • 

My other senses were abused in various other 
ways. Simultaneously a sea lion barked and a lion 
roared (Eilers was able to identify the sounds, ) and 
a pungent odor of some animal reached our noses. In 
those several seconds of thought and experience I 
could indeed understand how his job would take a 
" little getting used to." . 

It is throUgh talking with Eilers that one learns a 
great deal of pertinent information, and well, zoo 
trivia. We were told that peacocks spend the nights 
in trees and if there were young that couldn't get up 
in the branches, well, " it's tough for them. II Further, 
how many people are aware that squirrels play

bUll~luaulg and warehouse 

see the Zoo standing 
functioning entity 

complete with seemingly a thousand different 
departments. 

CoaItaa& COIIItructioa 
While making "the rounds" we learned the history 

and background on such establishments IS the 
horticultural area (where they grow special grasses, 
plants etc.), the garage, the carpentry shop, the 
draftsmen's room, the hospital and a myriad of 
other enclosures. All around the Zoo we noticed 
constant construction going on and "new" brainchild 
projects continually being proposed and ~ 
plemented. Eilers, feeling it necessary to know an 
people in every department ("Wen, where would I 
be if something happened and I didn't know so-and-
so's name"), makes it a point to "keep his nose in 
everything." 

Any institution would find it hard to equal the 
diverse selection of equipment and objects found 
within the Zoo. 

From Purina Rat Chow to a crematory (where all 
dead animals end up) you experience a range (ex-
cuse the pun) of things. In one room we found a 
freezer full or fish, four large buckets of hard boiled 
eggs, and a list of the animals' diets for the nelttday. 
I copied down a chalked-in entry that read "Apes: 23 
carrots, 12 sweet potatoes, 32 apples, 36 oranges, 2 
celery, 2 bread, 24 eggs, 6 lettuce, 18 bananas ." 

"You can see why the Zoo needs outside 
donations, II said Eilers. 

One is never totally removed from man though, 
even at night, in the midst of beasts. Jets from 
Lindbergh field periodically flew their routes over 
the Zoo. And as for downtown San Diego, we 
received a postcard view of it while inspecting the 
skyfari~ with the lights of San Diego blinking like 
the eyes of a large row of owls just visited minutes 
before . 

From the sublime we travelled to the slimy. While 
Eilers claimed to haVe " no favorites" among the 
animals, he was quick to state that snakes fall in a 
category of creatures he would rather ignore. After 
checking to see the heat was correctly functioning 
for the Komodo dragons, we walked around the glass 
enclosed snake windows. No tears were shed as we 

left the offspring of Eve's seducer and made our way 
to the Children's Zoo. 

A LastAequaintance 
At last, as the time was closing in on midnight, we 

reached the point where it appeared we had been in 
every building and site-though " hurriedly." Before 
the long night ended though, we "reacquainted" 
ourselves with the other evening security guard, 
John Hoey, heard several times through walkie-

• •• San DiegO Zoo by Nlghl 
talkie communication. This " reWlion" caused 
laughter, as the idea for the story had occurred to me 
while W( .1dering around Balboa Park after midnight 
(that's another story), gravitating to the zoo, where I 
proceeded to make a great deal of racket so 8.'l to 
gain a night guard's attention and ask him what the 
possibilities would be for such a story. Naturally, 
Hoey W8.'l the man I "found"~r it would be more 
appropriate to say he found me. 

That night, straightfaced, Hoey had told me that I 
had set off some " fence alarms. "I believed this until 
Eilers clued me into the fact that there are no 
alanns. Due to Hoey, some San Diegans are 
probably fearful of approaching too close to the zoo 
at night. A person once asked him how he kept in-
terlopers out at night and Hoey alUlwered in a 
somber voice, "We let loose the lions." 

It makes sense that you would have to approach 
such a job with a good sense of humor, and Hoey 
certainly fills that bill. He stated to us matter or 
factly that the evening hadn't been a total loss, but 
that things weren't great because, " Albert (the 
famous zoo gorilla) is getting too good at checkers-
he beat me three out or five games." 

His advice to us as we prepared to leave the Zoo: 
"Watch out for the snow snakes." 

And so it ended. Our thanks given could in no way 
remunerate the memories received. As Laura and I 
walked towards the car some noises drifted back to 
us, the muted calls of birds intertwined with the 

thousand other sounds of the night. Laura paused to 
take in the reverberating acoustics and finany said, 
"I felt I was at my roots, sort of." 

Alex Haley, eat your heart out.

Drama Depicts 
Opression 
By Apertheid 

"Survival," a critically ac-
claimed theatre production 
depicting the lives of blacks in 
South Africa under white minority 
rule and apartheid, will be 
presented next Wednesday in the 
Revelle cafeteria at8:30 p.m. 

The play is performed by 
members of the South African 
Black Theatre Project '77, a drama 
workshop brought out of South 
Africa as a result of the work of 
James Bertholf of Orange Coast 
College. Disputes with the US and 
South African governments and 
problems with an actors' union 
have been overcome in the 
process. "Survival" has already 
played across the US with great 
success, giving audiences a hint of 
the grim realities of apartheid. 

Arrangments to bring "Sur-
vival" to UCSD were made by 
Prof. Gerald Bender, currently 
teaching a Political Science class 
on South Africa here. Sponsor 
groups include Third College, the 
drama department, Muir College, 
and the political science depart-
ment. The play is set for May 18, at 
8 PM and tickets will be available 
at the Box Office for $2.00 each.
