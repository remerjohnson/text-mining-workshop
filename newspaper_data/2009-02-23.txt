STATEæBUDGETæ
ELIMINATESæ
$115MæFROMæ
UCæFUNDINGæ

By Reza Farazmand
News Editor

After three months of tense delib-
eration, state lawmakers approved 
a budget package late last week 
that signals trouble for California’s 
public higher-
education insti-
tutions, imple-
menting a 10 
percent across-
t h e - b o a r d  
funding cut to 
the University 
of California 
and California 
State University 
systems.

The $130 billion budget plan 
slashes UC funding by an addi-
tional $115 million, stretching the 
university’s total projected budget 
deficit to $450 million. The cuts are 
designed to save the state a sum of 
$264.4 million in the 2009-10 fis-
cal year. 

UC President Mark G. Yudof 
said the new round of cuts will 
have both immediate and long-term 
implications for the university and 
the state economy as a whole. 

“It is important to state clearly 
that the reductions contained in 
this budget will be felt by students, 
by faculty, by staff and ultimately by 

LoftæContinuesæSearchæforæPermanentæFunds

By Jesse Alm
Associate News Editor

After five months in operation, the 
Loft — Price Center’s music, culture and 
arts lounge — remains strapped for per-
manent funding sources. Meanwhile, 
campuswide debate regarding student 
oversight of the venue presses on with 
increasing intensity.

This year, the Loft is relying in 
part on temporary funding from the 
Department of Student Life, but the 
venue’s 2009-10 budget includes a 

shortfall of $165,134, which represents 
31.9 percent of total operating costs.

At a Feb. 11 meeting, the A.S. 
Council rejected the Loft’s proposal to 
include a measure on the spring A.S. 
ballot establishing a student Loft fee of 
$2.62 per quarter. The final draft of the 
proposal granted oversight of the fee 
to the A.S. Council and the Graduate 
Student Association by allowing these 
bodies to reduce or eliminate the fee 
with two consecutive two-thirds votes.

The Loft presented a similar initia-
tive to the council in October 2008, 
hoping to embed its own fee into the 
A.S. activity-fee increase that students 
approved last month. Councilmembers 
voted down that proposal, largely 
due to its lack of formal mechanisms 
for student oversight. After amend-

In light of two A.S. 
Council decisions to 
exclude campus venue 
from ballots, the Loft’s 
future remains uncertain.

A female reported to UCSD police 
last week that she was pushed to the 
ground and sexually assaulted in park-
ing lot 102 at approximately 8:30 p.m. 
on Tuesday, Feb. 3. 

The suspected rapist, who was 
described as an adult Asian male 
approximately six feet in height, was 
reported as fleeing toward North 
Torrey Pines Road on foot directly 
following the assault. 

The police department released 
a community advisory bulletin last 
Friday, advising students to use 
discretion when taking shortcuts 
through isolated parts of campus 
and utilize the Community Service 
Officer Escort Program available 
daily from 5 p.m. to 1 a.m.

A committee assembled in 
December by Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs Penny Rue — com-
posed of student and department rep-
resentatives — met for the first time on 
Feb. 10 to review and provide recco-
mendations for the revision of UCSD’s 
alcohol policy, first composed in 1987 
and later revised in 2003. 

Recent difficulties in planning and 
promoting campus events have called 
into question the relevance of cur-
rent regulations, particularly regarding 
advertising and sponsorship clauses, 
which includes a provision stating 
“The availability of alcohol at events 
shall not be advertised.”

A.S. Associate Vice President of 
Programming Garrett Berg served as 
the committee’s single undergraduate 
representative.

“Countless organizations, includ-
ing the Alumni Association and even 
— if I remember correctly — the chan-
cellor’s office have violated this policy,” 
Berg said in an e-mail. “This policy 
should be lifted almost entirely, allow-
ing events to advertise alcohol service 

as long as it includes a phrase such as 
‘21 [and up] bring valid, government-
issued ID.’”

A.S. councilmembers criticized the 
administration last quarter after the 
Loft, a University Centers-managed 
campus venue, was allowed to run 
a promotional campaign for a wine-
tasting event that appeared to break 
advertising regulations in accordance 
with the disputed alcohol policy. The 
campaign was a topic of discussion at 
the committee’s meeting. 

“To consider alternatives regarding 
the current policy language prohibit-
ing the reference of alcohol service in 
event announcements, the committee 
will look at the policies of other uni-
versities that permit such references,” 

Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student 
Life and committee chair Gary L. 
Ratcliff said in an e-mail.

Committee members discussed 
revising convoluted or unclear areas of 
the policy, focusing heavily on restric-
tions.

“The policy currently prohibits 
alcohol-related sponsors if the event 
serves alcohol, but it allows it if the 
event does not serve alcohol,” Berg 
said. “This just seems incredibly con-
tradictory and, quite frankly, confus-
ing.”

Estate Office — represented by

ing the bill to address these concerns, 
University Events Office Director 
Martin Wollesen said he was “shocked” 
and “disappointed” that the council 
remained unwilling to put the issue 
before the student body.

“Students are smart, they want to 
participate, and they want a voice,” he 
said. “I believe very strongly in this 
place, and a referendum is a good mea-
sure of student support.”

A.S. President Donna Bean said 
that placing the Loft measure on the 
A.S. ballot would send students a mixed 
message. This quarter’s fee referendum 
included a four-year moratorium on 
activity-fee increases, and while the 
Loft fee would be separate from the 
activity fee and would not require the 
endorsement of the council, she said 
that many students may be confused 
about these distinctions.

She added that Loft’s experimen-
tal business model — which relies on 
funds that are not yet secured — is 
fiscally irresponsible and puts an unfair 
burden on students.

“We don’t see shared governance 
until they need something from us,” 

she said. “At the end of the day, $30,000 
[in annual A.S. Programming fees] is 
already supporting the Loft. I think a 
lot of people forget this.”

A.S. Assistant Vice President 
of Academic Affairs and University 
Centers Advisory Board Chairwoman 
Lana Blank worked with Wollesen to 
develop the most recent Loft propos-
al, which originally stipulated UCAB 
oversight of the fee.

In response to a popular suggestion 
among councilmembers that the Loft 
simply organize an independent refer-
endum, Blank explained that running 
an election campaign requires at least 
$5,000 to cover advertisement expenses 
and online TritonLink services. For 
this reason, including the measure on 
the annual A.S. ballot would be more 
practical, she said.

Wollesen said the Loft would only 
run its own referendum as a last resort.

Following the council’s rejection 
of the Loft proposal, Blank said she 
has received encouragement from Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs Penny 
Rue to reintroduce the bill. However, 
she said she may have to wait until the 
end of Spring Quarter — when the 

newly elected council takes office — to 
present a new draft of the measure.

While elected officials and admin-
istrators have deliberated over how to 
fund the Loft, a contingent of the cam-
pus community devoted to student-
run business has expressed skepticism 
regarding the benefits of maintaining 
the nightclub’s operations at all.

Yuki Murakami, a core member of 
both the UCSD Food Co-op and the 
social justice group One Earth One 
Justice, said that if students simply took 
advantage of the opportunities that 
already exist — such as an overwhelm-
ing number of campus organizations 
and intramural sports — life on cam-
pus would improve naturally.

“[The university is] taking a really 
artificial approach to enhancing stu-
dent life,” he said. “The main thing we 
need for student life is students, and we 
have them. People here think they need 
to be entertained, instead of entertain-
ing themselves.”

Yesenia Padilla, another Food 
Co-op core member, added that the 
four co-ops on campus — Groundwork 
Books, the Che Cafe, the General Store 
and the Food Co-op — have faced 

growing debt for years, and that the 
university should provide financial 
support to these struggling enterprises 
before it considers permanent commit-
ments to a new student venue.

“The Loft is just another attempt 
to put another nail in our collective 
coffin,” she said. “I don’t think that any 
concession the university is going to 
give is going to benefit students at all.”

Nevertheless, as long as the Loft 
faces a funding shortfall, students will 
remain high on its list of potential reve-
nue sources. Sixth College Senator John 
Cressey said that the council would be 
wise to institutionalize student over-
sight while the opportunity exists, even 
if it means sharing this responsibility 
with other campus departments and 
college councils.

“It’s dangerous to assume that A.S. 
is the only student-representative body 
on this campus,” he said. “We, as A.S., 
have a duty and responsibility to get as 
much out of a referendum as possible. 
If we make blanket statements, we give 
up that opportunity.”

Development Ginger Truschke — 
emphasized a need for policy clari-
fication regarding campus vendors 
licensed to serve alcoholic beverages. 
Business Affairs Associate Controller 
Sally Brainerd and campus police 
representative Lt. David Rose recom-
mended that the Use of Alcoholic or 
Malt Beverage Request Form be updat-
ed to increase clarity of the document, 
citing a trend in requests that contain 
incomplete information.

Rose told the committee that his 

office processes 600 to 700 permit 
requests per year; in response, a sub-
committee was formed to review the 
permit form and consider revisions.

The safety and wellbeing of stu-
dents remained a priority throughout 
the discussion. Director of Student 
Policies and Judicial Affairs Tony 
Valladolid requested the presence of a 
student health representative for alco-
hol education.

The focus of discussions about safe-
ty and security, especially regarding the 
Sun God Festival, worried Berg.

“I was surprised, especially con-
sidering the enormous changes we 
were forced to make last year,” Berg 
said. “We were suddenly discussing the 
merits of selling shot glasses, alcohol 
service at venues like [Porter’s Pub] 
and Round Table, and even alcohol 
service at the event itself. While it 
was only the first meeting, I am wor-
ried that Sun God may once again be 
singled out.”

Graduate Student Association Vice 
President of Campus Affairs Alex 
James said he was pleased with the 

progress made at the committee’s first 
meeting, especially in discussion of 
revising the policy’s tone.

“There is no overarching driving 
principle of what the policy is doing,” 
he said. “Originally, it seemed to dis-
courage drinking. The new focus is 
encouraging responsible drinking … it 
will be better for students.”

The committee plans to meet bi-
weekly throughout the review process.

people across California who ben-
efit in their daily lives from the uni-
versity’s work,” Yudof said in a state-
ment. “Lower spending for higher 
education ultimately erodes student 
opportunity, innovation, health care 
and medical research and economic 
growth for California.”

Yudof warned that the state’s 
continued failure to adequately 
fund the UC system could ulti-
mately have a negative impact on 
the university’s academic programs, 
possibly including increased class 
sizes and the hiring of fewer full-
time faculty members. He has 
held meetings over the last several 
months with leaders from each of 
the UC campuses to discuss the 
impact of decreased state funding 
on university operations.

“I will be working closely with 
the campuses to determine how best 
to absorb the new cuts in a way 
that protects the academic program 
and student services to the greatest 
extent possible,” Yudof said. “And 
the university will continue work-
ing in committed partnership with 
the state and with the other seg-
ments of public higher education to 
support the economic recovery of 
California.”

Although the university has yet 
to announce any decisions regard-
ing student fee increases for next 
year, the UC Board of Regents will 
discuss the option as a way of off-
setting the effects of the current 
budget shortfall at a meeting next 
quarter, according to a university 
statement.

Dusty Rulebook Needs a New Party Dress
By Simone Wilson
Senior Staff Writer

STUDENT LIFE — Above all — 
according to Assistant Vice Chancellor 
of Student Life Gary Ratcliff,  and 
pretty much any other higher-up you 
might ask — “campus priority is always 
the safety and health of students and 
the community.”

Well said. Unfortunately, it’s all too 
often the case that in shooting for per-
fection, administrators form idealistic 
policies in over-official language that 
altogether avoid getting their hands 
dirty in the real grit of the situation 
— and, in doing so, only facilitate a 
dangerous hush-hush policy that’s suc-
cessful neither in the department of 
neither safety nor enjoyment.

Luckily, after being called out for 
double-standarding the recent ad 
campaigns of Bear Garden — an 
Associated Students keg event — 
and Sip — a classy “vine-tasting” 
affair at university-sponsored campus 
venue the Loft — Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs Penny Rue took 
it upon herself to sound the Triton 
conch at last, summoning a diverse 
committee to the round table with the 
mission of revising UCSD’s horribly 
stale procedure manual on campus 
“consumption of alcoholic and/or 
malt beverages.”

The current alcohol policy and 
event-request paperwork — a nearly 
uncrackable puzzle of a form required 
of anyone looking to host an alcohol-
enhanced shindig on campus — has 
been called out by every remotely 
affected department as a muddled 
affair desperately in need of a 21st 
century makeover. Originally drawn 
up in 1987 and barely tweaked in 
2003 after yearlong committee rus-
tlings (um, deja vu), the policy pro-
hibits even the implication of poten-
tial boozing in event advertising and 
lays down such intangible laws as 
“The amount of alcoholic beverages 
available shall be reasonably limited 
by the size of the target population 
which may legally consume alcohol.”

Even better: “Whenever alcoholic 
beverages are served, at least an equal 
volume of non-alcoholic beverages 
must be made available at the site 
of the function. It is strongly sug-

gested that food also be made avail-
able at these functions and may be 
required by an approving authority.” 
From there, it becomes systematically 
more and more vague who exactly is 
allowed to oversee and approve the 
events, leading to inefficient build-
ups of paperwork at each stage in the 
process.

In addition, alcohol brands are 
prohibited from sponsoring events 
where that poisonous youth-killer is 
served, but are allowed to sponsor 
events where alcohol isn’t served — 
effectively eliminating most chance 
of profit and creating a paradox as 
ridiculous as Red Bull being strictly 
relegated to promoting tea parties. 

Now, if UCSD’s reputation for 
sluggish talks (see: Grove Caffe 
oversight committee) holds up even 
halfway, it could be years before 
campus orgs and nonaffiliated rent-
ers are freed of the beaureacratic 
straightjacket that keeps them from 

the advertising and sponsorship they 
need to make alcoholic events a suc-
cess. But, optimistically, there seem 
to be enough screwed-straight heads 
in on this one to possibly reach some 
resemblance to cohesive revisions, 
and they’ve agreed to meet every two 
weeks until the proposal is ready.

What committee members must 
remember in rewriting the policy — 
and, really, it must be rewritten from 
scratch, with an emphasis on more eas-
ily granting permits under a solidified 
and cross-campus standard of security 
requirements — is that the least pro-
ductive and most dangerously back-
wards approach the university can take 
toward student-life regulation is deni-
al. You want designated drivers? Let us 
know we’ll be drinking, so draw-straws 
doesn’t happen once we’re already all 
wasted. You want to avoid uninhibited 
dorm-room binges on Sun God? Let 
them do it in the open air. 

As always, transparency is key, and 

reality checks are a must. Though it’s 
probably a good thing that only two 
student representatives sit on Rue’s 
new committee, seeing how much we 
rowdy youngsters love to squabble 
with not much but our own freedom 
in mind, hopefully they will be able to 
communicate what an inevitability it 
is that students will drink in any case, 
and that all efforts would be best fun-
neled toward facilitating the safest pos-
sible environment. Since it’s a time-told 
reality that anyone can pretty much get 
drunk whenever they want, whether 
that be by means of an overpriced 
beer or snuck-in vodka water bottle 
— and that nothing can come close to 
promoting campus togetherness like 
a good, long drink between classes — 
there seems no remaining reason to 
prohibit student orgs and local busi-
nesses from profiting off that thirst.

a resident corpse in our toilet-paper 
holder and 3) entertaining reading 
material is a guarantee in the form 
of David Deida’s “The Way of the 
Superior Man.” Although this men’s 
self-help book has been in print for 
nearly six years and is so popular that 
I’ve heard it referenced by past boy-
friends, I’d never actually read it until 
I discovered it on my ceramic toilet 
top. Peeking at the table of contents, 
my eyes fell upon “Part Four: What 
Women Really Want.” 

The “What She Wants Is Not What 
She Says” subsection recounted a sup-

posedly true tale of a couple suddenly 
overcome by sexual desire, hence 
deciding to make love in the woods. 
When the man becomes overexcited, 
he asks his wife to settle down, lest 
he prematurely come. She does the 
opposite, demanding he fill her with 
his “seed.” He complies — and then 
she’s pissed. 

This, Deida explains, is a classic 
example of a woman asking for one 
thing but wanting another. But men 
shouldn’t be distracted by a woman’s 
attempts to test their purpose. As 
Deida writes, “Your woman is a form 
of the goddess, taunting you, testing 
you, seducing you, ready to chop 
your head off with her wrath if you 
are weak and ambiguous in your 
truth.” 

After spending Friday night 
watching a collection of Vagina 
Monologues showcasing women’s 
sexual wants, desires and fears, 
I think Deida’s forewarning of our 
illogical behavior oversimplifies us. 
And although Deida’s view of women 
seems crazy (other book sections 
include “She Doesn’t Really Want to 
Be Number One”), his bestselling sta-
tus shows that a good amount of men 
are searching to understand women. 
While I think it’s hard to generalize 
gender tendencies in the first place, 
I can tell you one thing that would’ve 
most likely solved this tale of mis-
communication: an orgasm. 

If I can impart any piece of advice 
on a man searching to aid his rela-
tionship, it’s to drop the inapplicable 
theories from silly self-help books 
and pick up a female pleasure how-to. 
Of course, this won’t solve commu-
nication problems, but finding your 
partner’s G-spot is a much more deci-
pherable feat than actually under-
standing her actions.

As confusing as human beings 
are, we’ve all got basic needs: food, 
sex and sleep. And if you’re in touch 
with your inner Homo sapiens, you 
know that long-term scarcity in any 
one of those categories breeds a 
ravenous craving. It’s about time all 
those befuddled men who claim the 
opposite sex to be enigmatic start 
with the basics. Suck it up and plunge 
into the awesome mystery that is the 
vagina. After all, women want to be 
sexually satisfied just as much as men 
do (so, like, a lot). And if you can’t 
meet that plea for satisfaction with a 
simple quickie, educate yourself.

UCÊSHOULDNÕTÊHOLLOWÊSTUDENTSÕÊRESOURCESÊTOÊOFFSETÊCUTS
By Trevor Cox
Associate Opinion Editor

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA — 
Last Friday, after a 106-day delay 
due to resistance from his own party, 
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed 
into law a greatly compromised 
California budget that has succeeded 
in dissatisfying almost everyone. Of 
the estimated $15 billion to be cut 
from state programs in the next 17 
months, a whopping $8.6 billion will 
come from public education, includ-
ing $115 million from the University 
of California ($50 million of which 
could be reimbursed by allocations 
from the federal stimulus package) as 
part of a plan to cut 10 percent across 
the board among public universities.

Rather than instituting dramatic, 
systemic change to the university —  
the only means by which our $450 
million “budget challenge” could be 
gradually resolved — the current plan 
calls for more of the same tactics: 
increases in tuition and supposed-
ly temporary reductions in service. 
Though the university has not for-
mally decided how the new bud-
get will impact student fees for the 
2009-10 school year, the UC Office 
of the President said those numbers 
will be determined during Spring 

Quarter. Increases at this point are 
all but inevitable, given the fact that 
every year in the last decade, students 
have seen a 7 to 10 percent tuition 
increase at the university — except, 
by virtue of coincidence, the year 
that Schwarzenegger was running for 
re-election.

A hefty portion of the deficit 
($122 million) currently stems from 
underfunded enrollments — i.e., stu-
dents the university supports without 
the help of state funding. While a cap 
on current enrollment levels should 
narrow this gap, it’s not a precedent 
we want to set. Ideally, California 
should be able to fund every student 
who chooses to invest in our state’s 
future by pursuing a UC education.

Meanwhile, one of the few state-
funded areas not subjected to budget-
slashing is — as always — the prison 
system. If the state can afford to fund 
each of its prisoners in the state peni-
tentiary system, then why shouldn’t 
UC students be fully accounted for 
as well? 

Stephen Levy, head of the Center 
for the Continuing Study of the 
California Economy in Sacramento, 
estimates that if California offered an 
early release to nonviolent criminals, 
the state could save around $1 billion 
— more than twice the UC system’s 

current debt. 
Assuming a 10 percent increase 

in mandatory student fees — as 
Christopher Newfield, UC Santa 
Barbara professor and author of “The 
Cuts Report: Effects of the Governor’s 
Budget Proposals on the University 
of California” and “Current Budget 
Trends and the Future of the 
University of California” has pre-
dicted — we’ll see our bill jump from 
$7,126 to $7,850 (for in-state stu-
dents). Then there are all those other 
mandatory fees that vary from cam-
pus to campus, inflating the average 
UC tuition to  about $9,000 per year, 
up nearly a grand from 2008-09.

The new tide of student fees comes 
at an inopportune moment for those 
hard-hit by the economic crisis, but 
it will recoup only a fraction of the 
funds needed for the university to get 
out of the red. Newfield stated that in 
order to fill the current deficit by way 
of tuition increases alone, fees would 
have to rise 40 percent in one year, 
bringing total costs of attendance into 
private university range — those with 
less depleted resources, as they’re far 
less reliant on government funding 
than we are. Of course, that prospect 
is a near impossibility: We’re not in 
danger of being subjected to private 
school tuition levels for next year. 

We are, however, in imminent 
danger of feeling the consequences of 
our drained resources. University of 
California President Mark G. Yudof 
says that students and staff can expect 
to feel the strains of these budgets 
cuts on a personal level. He warns 
against the consequences of lower 
spending, arguing that it will lead 
to the eventual decline of student 
opportunity and economic growth.

If it makes us feel any better, 
Yudof does note that $30 million 
in savings has been realized at the 
UC Office of the President alone. 
High-level salaries have been frozen 
and nonessential forms of spending, 
such as travel, have been severely 
restricted.

As helpful as these adjustments 
are, they can’t adequately offset a debt 
of $450 million. In the current state 
of crisis, we must turn to innovative 
alternatives to alleviate current bud-
getary strains.

Corporate funding of research 
universities has risen in recent years:  
According to Insidehighered.com, 
from 2000 to 2005 universities have 
witnessed a 50 percent increase in 
corporate contributions to research 
and development in science and engi-

neering nationwide. In 2005, UCSD 
— one of the greatest beneficiaries 
of corporate funding in the U.S. — 
received over $34 million toward 
research, more than any other UC 
campus that year. While some oppo-
nents of the practice, such as per-
petual presidential candidate Ralph 
Nader, argue that private funding 
of public research can compromise 
university autonomy, this crisis — in 
which the state cannot provide its 
students with even the most basic 
services — requires us to take charge 
for ourselves and seek outside assis-
tance.

Yudof said that he will be work-
ing with each of the UC campuses 
to decide how to contend with these 
cuts so as to best preserve academic 
programs and student services, yet 
nowhere does he mention consult-
ing students themselves — the real 
victims of the educational crisis. The 
formation of cross-campus student 
committees about these budget cuts 
is central to the preservation of ser-
vices students value most. We will, 
after all, be feeling the consequences 
much deeper than the legislators who 
have determined our current fate. 

Students who already have a diffi-
cult time enrolling in required classes 

can only expect their problems to 
worsen. They’ll be paying higher 
tuition for a longer period of time for 
a lesser education than that of their 
forerunners. In order to make this 
crisis as temporary as state leaders 
would like us to believe it is, the uni-
versity can’t idly wait for government 
funds, nor can it continually raise 
tuition to fractionally offset the cuts. 
Rather, it must independently solve 
the problems we face if it hopes to 
maintain the quality of the UC edu-
cational experience.

Dear Editor,
Obama giveth, but Congress and 

the oil companies taketh away!
On the one hand, we are getting a 

stimulus package that is supposed to 
help us all, but on the other hand, gas 
prices are rising steeply again for no 
apparent reason.

Democrats used to scream about 
the rise in gas prices. Yet they have been 
in control of Congress since January 
2007, and the prices are going up.

Now the Democrats control the 
White House and both houses of 
Congress for the first time since 1994, 
and gas prices are going up. 

Here in California, prices have risen 
by nearly $1 over the last month or so.

Yet oil companies continue to make 
record profits. In 2008, Exxon Mobil 
made a profit of $45.22 billion, the larg-
est annual profit in U.S. history. This 
beat the last record, which was set in 
2007 by … Exxon!

It does not take a genius to fig-
ure out that something is wrong here. 
This is profiteering at the expense of 
American consumers, who already 
have their backs to the wall dealing 
with unemployment and the housing 
crisis.

Why will the Democrats not take 
some action?

Gas prices should go back to $1.40 
a gallon or less. This will give relief to 
millions who are just trying to keep 
their heads above water in this current 
crisis.

Now that’s a real stimulus.

Dear Editor,
I’ve been very fortunate to work 

with college students since leaving 
UCSD. Some are savers, but most 
are spenders.

College students are supposed 
to have the brightest minds, but the 
fact of the matter is that no business 
can survive without sales alone. This 
includes our great university, where 
some of you have gone into extraor-
dinary debt for a piece of paper with 
facsimile signatures. 

Most of you have credit-card 
debt or a college loan. Purchasing 
things on impulse or in bulk to save 
later on things in this day and age 
has been proven to be a poor busi-
ness decision.

I advise you to learn to dis-
trust anybody wearing a tie who 
seems nice and suggests you spend 
your money. The next time some-
one recommends a second checking 
account or gives you an option for 
paper or plastic, please say, “No, 
thank you.”

S ITESEEN POWELL’S SWEET SHOPPE
BY SONIA MINDEN  SENIOR STAFF WRITER

Giving some validity 
to the old adage “you 
are the company you 
keep,” Dr. James 
Fowler explores the 
link between 
our genes 
and social 
networks.

FITTING

I f sugar were a religion, Powell’s Sweet Shoppe would be its car-amel-laden, rainbow-sprinkled, 
marshmallow-stuffed Mecca. While 
downtown La Jolla parking can be 
more maddening than gum on the 
shoe and the store’s close quarters 
are impeded by kids hopped up on 
Pop Rocks, the trek is soon for-
gotten — whether at first bite of 
gelato or at first lick of a Bit o’ Honey 
lolli, Powell’s is a haven for any self-
confessed sweet tooth. Even when 
it dawns on you, post tummyache, 
that you spent a week’s paycheck on 
gumdrops, there’s nothing so blissful 
as a few sugary seconds to invoke 
the days of swing sets and simple 
pleasures. 

Though Powell’s is a relatively 
new franchise with over 15 California 
locations, there’s something authen-
tically, singularly retro about the 
Technicolor funhouse, with its creaky 
wooden shelving, gigantic barrels 
and secret, multisized drawers, all 
boasting candy strata from decades 
past. The store samples from every 

childhood — Grandma’s Zagnut bars 
(peanut butter crammed with toasted 
coconut and smothered in choco-
late), Aunt Maude’s candy cigarettes, 
wax lips, Bottle Caps, Zebra gum, 
those nasty little pink-and-blue but-
tons, bonbons and gummies in all 
flavors imaginable — the list is head-
numbingly, decadently endless.

Of course, there’s a lot of Powell’s 
bulk that doesn’t merit boasting; a 
third of the goodies are appealingly 
unwrapped versions of grocery-store 
norms — Mike ‘n’ Ikes, Red Vines, 
sour rings — at around twice the 
price. And with glittering walls of 
gemlike jelly beans and M&Ms, it’s 
hard to resist stocking up on predict-
able favorites. But save your money 
for the best treat Powell’s has to offer: 
its lip-smacking, every-last-spoonful 
luscious gelato. A small cup costs just 
under a Lincoln, but the fist-sized 
portion is so dense with soft, buttery 
gobs of cream that even economic 
deficit can’t stop La Jollans from lin-
ing out the door. After shamelessly 
sampling the Limon cello poppyseed 

and a dozen others, I decided on half 
peanut-butter cup (the counter lady’s 
favorite) and half creme brulee (my 
favorite). FYI, those Student Saver 
books have a coupon for one free 
serving — start collecting.

While the vintage aesthetic at 
Powell’s is somewhat compromised 
by its flatscreen TV (playing Willy 
Wonka on repeat) and the gag-gift 
merchandise, the appeal is over-
whelming — an acid-trip sprawl 
of what we can only assume to be 
magic. It’s almost too overwhelming 
for the first timer, with screaming 
tots, clattering bins and a chocolaty 
must pervading the room’s every cor-
ner: But don’t turn back. After all, 
the hunt for that irresistibly nostalgic 
treasure is part of the fun — just 
make sure to pack some emergency 
Tums for the ride home.

E v e r b e e n c a l l e d 
a social but-
ter� y? Does 
being popu-

lar seem to just 
come naturally? 

According to UCSD 
associate professor of 

political science James Fowler and 
Harvard University sociologist Nicholas 
Christakis, who are studying the impact 

genes might have on our social net-
works, popularity may be more natu-

ral than you realize.
The pair researches this cor-

relation by examining the social 
networks of both identical and 
fraternal twins, based on the sci-
entific belief that identical twins 
share 100 percent of the genes, 
while fraternal twins share only 
about 50 percent.

“If the social networks of 
identical twins are more similar to 

one another than the fraternal twins, 
then genes might be playing a role in 
social networks,” Fowler said.

Data compiled by Add Health, a 
national representative study of 90,000 
adolescents from 140 different schools, 
was also used to analyze social networks. 
Each participant was asked to name up to 
five male and female friends. Within the 
study, information from 1,000 twins is 
evaluated, helping Fowler and Christakis 
speculate how much variation within 
social networks is due to genes and how 
much is due to environment.

The use of twin studies, however, has 
been controversial, according to Evan 
Balaban, a behavioral neuroscientist 
from McGill University. In an October 
2007 Scientific American magazine arti-
cle, “The Genetics of Politics,” Balaban 
warned that the twin method alone is 
not enough to prove that a concrete 
connection exists between our genes 
and our lifestyle and behavior. Because 
approximately two-thirds of identical 
twins share the same bloodstream while 
in utero, similar levels of hormones and 
other compounds produced by each fetus 
could lead to similar personality traits.

Hereditary traits, determined by spe-
cific genes inherited from both parents, 
are the focus of Fowler and Christakis’ 
sociological research. A dominant allele 
triumphs over a recessive allele, and that 
trait is reflected in appearance and per-
haps even personality.

There are three major components to 

the study: the number of times someone 
is named a friend, the probability that 
two of your friends will be friends with 
one another (known as transivity), and 
how central a person is within a social 
network, which can be seen as the dif-
ference between those standing in the 
center of a party and those who are 
wallflowers.

The pair determined that there may 
be a genetic tendency to introduce 
friends to one another, and in this way, 
a person’s genes can have an impact 
on whether two other people become 
friends. Additionally, they hypothesized 
that individuals at the center of social 
networks are more susceptible to emo-
tional fluctuation or health-related issues 
such as obesity. Thus, if your friends are 
happy, you are more likely to be happy, 
and if your friends are obese you are also 
more likely to become obese.

Affecting an array of health outcomes, 
for instance, are certain supergenes, such 
as Dopamine Serotonin. Fowler suspects 
that genes like these have such a wide 
impact on a variety of outcomes because 
they influence social networks as well.

“We want to see if social networks 
are able to explain why some of these 
health outcomes have a genetic basis and 
if social networks mediate the relation 
between genes and health outcomes,” 
Fowler said.

A separate, but related, topic to 
Fowler’s research is the link between genes 
and political participation and ideology. 
Genes can affect whether someone votes 
and that person’s ties to a political party.

“We come into this world with ten-
dencies for being liberal or not,” Fowler 
said. “This is controversial. If you take a 
person out of a rich neighborhood and 
put them in a poor neighborhood, they 
will not completely adopt the ideology 
of the poor neighborhood, proving that 
environment is not everything.”

According to Fowler, the tenden-
cy to be liberal is associated with the 
Dopamine DrD4 gene, which is connect-
ed with experience seeking. This gene, 
in combination with increased social 
networks, raises a person’s chance of 
becoming liberal.

Fowler’s research has been featured 
in the New York Times, “Good Morning 
America” and “The Colbert Report.” 
Currently, Fowler and Christakis are 
working on a book titled “Connected: 
The Surprising Power of Social Networks 
and How They Shape Our Lives,” which

H illel of San Diego, the Foundation for Jewish Campus Life, is one step closer to the culmination of 20 years of Jewish 
Student Center planning, despite the lengthy 
legal battle keeping the group from breaking 
ground. However, the Taxpayers for Responsible 
Land Use remain concerned over the plans, 
which may increase traffic and possibly threaten 
birds of prey currently nesting in the area.

On Feb. 18, a ruling in the case of Taxpayers 
for Responsible Land Use et al. v. City of San 
Diego by the State of California Court of Appeals 
further delayed the Hillel center’s construction. 

The Court of Appeals Fourth Appellate 
District, Division One, heard oral arguments 
for the case on Feb. 3, in the Student Services 
Building. The court’s ruling upheld San Diego 
City’s sale of Site 653, a triangular plot of land 
across from UCSD’s Theatre District, to Hillel 
of San Diego, but requires the group to prepare 
an environmental impact report before moving 
forward with construction.

Hillel of San Diego planned the center as a 
facility for Jewish students similar to the Cross 
Cultural Center, the Women’s Center and the 
Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Resource 
Center located on campus. The proposed proj-
ect includes a kosher kitchen, a multipurpose 
room that can accommodate three religious 
services simultaneously, a library, classroom 
and meeting space for students. Due to separa-
tion of church and state, Hillel of San Diego 
cannot have a center on campus but would 
like to have one as close as possible, Executive 
Director of Hillel Rabbi Lisa Goldstein said.

“Hillel centers give Jewish students a safe 
place to create community and deepen their 
Jewish connection, while offering the entire 
campus community resources and informa-
tion about Judaism and the Jewish people,” 
Goldstein said in an e-mail.

TRLU has sponsored a series of legal actions 
to halt the building project. The group’s most 
recent legal appeal focused on the city’s issu-
ance of a mitigated negative declaration, a 
statement finding that a building will have a 
significant environmental impact and identify-
ing the actions that need to be taken to reduce 

the impact to insignificant levels.
“TRLU strongly opposes locating this stu-

dent activity canter in a single-family residen-
tial area because it would create severe prob-
lems of parking, traffic congestion and traffic 
safety,” TRLU representative Ross Starr said.

Mitigations for this case include expand-
ing on-site parking to accommodate expected 
student traffic, which Hillel has satisfied by 
increasing planned parking from 40 to 68 on-
site spaces.

TRLU sued the city of San Diego on the 
basis that the mitigated negative declaration 
was not issued properly and did not take into 
account the impact of pedestrians crossing the 
intersection of La Jolla Village Drive and La 
Jolla Scenic Way, and the possibility that the 
intended site is home to birds of prey.

The judge required a further study of birds of 
prey nesting on the site and the possible impact 
of pedestrians on traffic as they cross the inter-
section. After the appeal, the environmental fac-
tors remain the sticking point, with Hillel now 
required to prepare an environmental impact 
report.

“We admire Hillel of San Diego and its aim 
of arranging a student center in the vicinity of 
UCSD,” Starr said in a statement. “The conflict is 
not about Hillel. It’s about appropriate land use.”

Another difficulty in this case is the unique 
location of UCSD’s main campus, which is 
adjacent to small residential areas instead of 
commercial ones.

“Every other UC campus Hillel center is 
located in a commercial, mixed-use, or multi-
family area,” Starr said. “That’s what the com-
mercial areas adjacent to campus are for. 
From UCSD’s earliest days, there has been an 
understanding between the university and its 
neighbors that the campus would not spread 
into nearby single-family residential neigh-
borhoods. The location of the Hillel Student 
Center in this neighborhood would violate the 
understanding and set an irreversible prec-
edent.”

“We want to take what we’ve done, 

and show how it’s relevant in every-
day life,” Fowler said. “It is easy for 
the message to be lost in academic 
articles.”

Assisting in this 
endeavor is UCSD 
graduate student 
Christopher Dawes, 
who has been work-
ing with Fowler 
for four years and 
helped him with 
papers detailing 
genes and their 
impact on politi-
cal behavior. Dawes 
said Fowler’s work is 
unique to contem-
porary research.

“I’m not alone 
in saying that he’s 
doing some of the 
most interesting work in any field,” 
Dawes said. “His work in general 
has garnered so much attention that 
people are going to think in terms of 
health in new ways. It could open up 
a lot of new possibilities.”

One project Fowler hopes to tack-
le in the future will use Facebook; he 
calls his idea the human-nature proj-
ect. It would involve following dif-
ferent UCSD students on Facebook 
in order to see if real-life social webs 

also pertain to vir-
tual networks. 

“For a really 
long time, we’ve 
thought about 
individuals as 
though they 
were islands — a 
Robinson Crusoe 
model of social 
science,” said 
Fowler in a con-
versation with 
physicist Albert-
Laszlo Barabasi 
published in Seed 
magazine. “Being 
able to integrate 
information —

favor of TRLU by requiring further 
investigation of the environmental 
factors, the justices also pointed out 
in their opinion that the hypotheti-
cal determination that the project has 
a significant envi-
ronmental impact 
would not neces-
sarily preclude the 
eventual approval of 
the building project.

The Hillel build-
ing project has been 
in final planning 
stages since 2000 
but the center has 
been in the works 
since the spring of 
1990. However, 
TRLU and other 
private homeown-
ers in the area 
opposed the center’s 
construction.

When the city of San Diego grant-
ed exclusive negotiation right to Hillel 
of San Diego to develop the site in 
November 2000, the site was zoned 
as open space, which conflicted with 
the plans because religious buildings 

are not allowed in open-space zones. 
The conflict was resolved in May 2002 
when the city updated the La Jolla 
Community Plan and changed the 
zoning to a single-family area. TRLU’s 
first legal action accused San Diego 

City of improper 
rezoning. Hillel 
of San Diego won 
both the initial case 
and the appeal.

On May 9, 2006, 
the city approved 
the sale of land 
to Hillel of San 
Diego. TRLU chal-
lenged this based 
on three concerns: 
procedural techni-
calities, incorrect 
pricing of the land 
for sale and envi-
ronmental protec-
tion. In all, there 
were seven counts 

argued and on six of those, the judge 
ruled in Hillel of San Diego’s favor in 
March 2007.

how hard they fought at the end. But, 
I also knew that we could withstand 
their force to �nish the game, even 
when it came down to the wire.”

A�er junior guard Leilani Martin 
sank a pair of free throws, the Gators 
answered with a layup and a jumper 
to make the score 49-47 with seven 
seconds le� in regulation. San 
Francisco State, in a desperate attempt 
to upset the conference’s top team, 

fouled again, sending Carlisle to the 
line to convert both her attempts to 
hand the Gators a tough 51-47 loss. 

�e Triton defense put together 
another exceptional performance 
as the Gators hit just 36.5 percent of 
their �eld goal attempts on 19-for-
52 shooting. Osier led the team with 
15 points and 13 rebounds, while 
Carlisle pitched in 10 points, �ve 
assists and three steals.

With Saturday’s victory, the 

Tritons �nished their regular season 
home schedule with a record of 
12-2 at RIMAC Arena, winning 17 
of their last 18 games and securing 
the top seed heading into the CCAA 
Championship Tournament on 
March 3. UCSD will now host a 
conference tournament �rst-round 
game in two weeks.

remaining. Husted hit another three 
less than two minutes later and Lawley 
scored six of the next nine UCSD 
points, giving the home squad a 66-60 
advantage with 4:28 remaining.

“No team is going to play harder 
than us and I feel like that’s what it 
came down to — getting stops at key 
times, executing when we needed to,” 
Husted said.

A�er the Gators cut the lead to 
one, Husted, Kim, Poppen and Lawley 
knocked down clutch free throws to 
regain control. Husted scored the �nal 
two points of the game at the charity 
stripe with 16 seconds remaining and 
then triumphantly threw the ball into 
the air as the �nal buzzer sounded and 
the UCSD fans stormed the court to 
celebrate.

“�ere were times tonight when 
we weren’t perfect, but we found a 
way,” Carlson said. “It showed a lot of 
moxie, to get to the point towards the 
end of the game and make all our free 
throws.”

As a team, the Tritons went 26-of-
34 from the free-throw line, while also 
snagging 42 rebounds, compared to 
29 for the Otters.

Lawley scored a game-high 22 
points with seven rebounds, while 
Maulhardt was the game leader in 

both rebounds and assists, 12 boards 
and a career-high eight assists.

“When we get that kind of crowd, 
we can be very, very tough,” Carlson 
said. “We feed o� the energy in the 
crowd and we’re going to go out there 
and represent that student body as 
best we can.”

While the crowd did not reach 
Spirit Night proportions on Saturday, 
the Tritons still had an emotional boost 
on their side, with seven graduating 
seniors playing perhaps their �nal 
home game. Seniors Poppen, Kim, 
Maulhardt and Brett Stuckey helped 
UCSD to a quick start, combining for 
the �rst 18 Triton points of the game. 
Lawley scored the next nine, giving 
UCSD its largest lead of the game, 25-
11, with 8:52 le� in the �rst half.

“We just kept our heads in the 
game,” Lawley said. “We didn’t have 
any drop-o� from last night and that 
was one of the biggest things coach 
Carlson was telling us.”

Cal State Monterey Bay held 
UCSD scoreless over the next three 
minutes, climbing back to within 
�ve. �e Triton seniors responded 
with Husted, Kim and senior forward 
Darryl Lawlor connecting on three-
pointers, with Poppen scoring four 
points and Stuckey adding two in the 
�nal 5:23 of the half, building a 40-29 

lead at the break.
Missed o�ensive opportunities 

early in the second half allowed Cal 
State Monterey Bay to climb within 
two at the 11:26 mark. However, the 
bench responded to give the Tritons a 
slight cushion, with Acevedo hitting 
two from the line and Lawlor adding 
another three. Cal State Monterey 
Bay was slightly o� the mark on 
a few three-point attempts in the 
�nal minutes that could have made 
it a one-possession game, allowing 
Husted, Kim and Lawley to secure the 
Triton victory with free throws. 

 “We came in and we knew we had 
to win them both,” said Lawley, who 
scored 11 points with six rebounds 
and four assists. “We brought that 
intensity to both games.”

Kim, Husted, Poppen and Stuckey 
each reached double digits in scoring, 
with Kim notching a game-high 18 
and Husted, Poppen and Stuckey all 
adding 10. 

�e weekend sweep places UCSD 
in a tie with Humboldt State for fourth 
in the CCAA. A top-four �nish in 
conference will allow the Tritons to 
host a �rst-round game during the 
CCAA Tournament.

MEN’S BASKETBALL — “�e crowd 
was amazing,” senior guard Alan 
Husted said a�er UCSD’s Spirit Night 
game. “I feel like they led us to victory 
today ... We love the fans and hope-
fully they got a good show tonight.”

�e men’s basketball team won in 
exciting fashion on Feb. 20, hitting 
clutch free throws down the stretch 
to eek out a 78-71 victory over San 
Francisco State in a packed RIMAC 
Arena. Head coach Chris Carlson’s 
squad kept the momentum going 
on Saturday, following the pre-game 
Senior Night ceremony with a fast 
start against Cal State Monterey Bay, 
ending the weekend with a 72-65 

win against the Otters. UCSD holds 
an overall record of 15-9 (12-6 in 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association).

Husted o�ered the 3,408 fans at 
Friday night’s game something to 
cheer about early on, taking senior 
center A.J. Maulhardt’s pass for a 
layup, scoring the game’s �rst basket. 
But San Francisco State’s Alex �omas 
took some air out of the crowd, 
scoring the Gators’ �rst nine points 
on three scores from beyond the arc 
within the game’s �rst three and a 
half minutes. �omas then added 
his fourth successful three-pointer 
on four �rst-half attempts with 14:45 
to play, giving San Francisco State an 
early 14-8 advantage. 

Fortunately for the players and 

their fans, the six-point de�cit stood 
as the largest of the half for UCSD. 
Junior guard Tyler Acevedo came o� 
the bench with 7:33 remaining and 
immediately connected on a layup 
and a three-pointer. Senior guard 
Kelvin Kim and Husted then followed 
up with a �eld goal apiece. Maulhardt 
assisted on all four shots, as UCSD 
grabbed its �rst lead since the start of 
the game with just over three minutes 
le� in the half. �e tight �rst half 
ended with a Gator buzzer beater, 
tying the score.

“�ere were a couple moments 
where we didn’t �nish plays very well,” 
Carlson said. “We got contested shots 
and didn’t block out. �e rebounding 
totals were in our favor, but we didn’t 
get rebounds when we really needed 

them. Our transition defense let us 
down a couple of times. We need to 
get back there and take care of the 
hole, like we normally do.”

�e two squads played even closer 
throughout much of the second half, 
with the lead changing six times and 
the score tied on eight occasions 
during the �nal 20 minutes of play. 
�e Gators held another lead with 
less than 10 minutes remaining in 
the game, but never extended beyond 
a two-possession advantage. A�er 
junior guard Jordan Lawley and 
senior forward Shane Poppen each 
hit 1-of-2 from the line, Kim knocked 
down a huge three o� Lawley’s pass to 
give the Tritons a 57-56 lead with 7:39

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL — The 
13th ranked Tritons added another 
two wins to their near-perfect record 
over the weekend, defeating San 
Francisco State 51-47 on Feb. 20 and 
Cal State Monterey Bay 70-50 on 
Feb. 21. The dual wins on Spirit 
Night and Senior Night concluded 
the Tritons’ final home games of the 
season, improving UCSD to a 17-1 
standing in California Collegiate 
Athletic Association and clinching 
the top spot in the upcoming confer-
ence tournament.

Senior center Alexis Gaskin 
and senior forward Michelle Osier 
turned in outstanding performances 
on Spirit Night, scoring 18 points 
apiece. Osier �nished 8-for-13 from 
the �eld and grabbed a game-high 17 
rebounds. Gaskin went 9-for-14 and 
notched �ve boards.

“Seniors understand the necessity 
and importance to come out every 
night ready to play because they 
know their time on the court is 

limited,” head coach Charity Elliott 
said. “�ose two just are the heart and 
soul of our team and I hope we have 
a lot more basketball le� with them.”

In a game they never trailed, the 
Tritons got o� to a fast start, leading 
10-3 �ve minutes into the �rst 
period. �e Otters closed the gap to 
within two when junior center Janet 
Oseguera’s three-point play made the 
score 16-14. Unable to withstand the 
Triton defense, Cal State Monterey 
Bay ceded 14 points in turnovers 
as Gaskin, Osier, freshman guard 
Chelsea Carlisle and junior forward 
Kristen Cabral each put up points to 
kick o� UCSD’s 16-7 run. Leading by 
a 16-point margin, the Tritons all but 
put the game away at the half with a 
score of 37-21.

�e Tritons, who outscored Cal 
State Monterey Bay in the paint by a 
margin of 24 points, led by as many 
as 24 (61-37) before gliding to a 
20-point victory.  

Carlisle recorded her �rst career 
double-double with 12 points and 10 
assists in the Triton victory.    

“We played together so well and 

the end result re�ected that,” Gaskin 
said. “On defense and o�ense, the �ow 
of the game was how we were playing 
earlier in the season. �e last few 
weeks, we had fallen away from our 
highest potential, which allowed a few 
teams to come too close, and teams 
like San Bernardino to get a win.”

On Friday evening, the women’s 
team faced a tighter contest when 
San Francisco State rallied from 
behind during the second half to 
give Tritons a scare. Trailing with 
3:56 le� on the clock, Gator junior 
guard Jessica Hout-Freeman nailed a 
three-pointer to keep San Francisco 
State in the game at 41-37. But with a 
boisterous Sprit Night crowd of 1,598 
enthusiastically cheering, the Tritons 
maintained control as back-to-back 
layups by Ilg and Carlisle put UCSD 
up by six with just under two minutes 
to play.

“Even though we ended the �rst 
half strong, we know that SFSU is 
never a team that backs down,” Gaskin 
said. “So we weren’t too surprised
