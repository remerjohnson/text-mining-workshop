~ondaYBRalIyh Bentsen Brings Campaign to U CSD 
nngers us 
Supporters Vice Presidential Candidate Breaks 

Traditional 'Student Issue' Themes 
By DENISE DADOR 
Staff Writer 
Furious George Bush suppor-

ters vocally displayed their anger 
at the Democratic rally Monday, 
complaining they had been un-
fairly ousted from the demon-
stration. 

As hundreds of Democratic 
supporters cheered vice presi-
dential candidate Sen. Lloyd 
Bentsen at Revelle Plaza, several 
students favoring Bush managed 
to detract attention from Bentsen's 
speech by continuously chanting 
"Bush, Bush, Bush" and "Four 
more years!" 

Youth for Bush representatives 
claimed Democratic campaian 
officials were kicking out Bush 
supporters and "threatening to 
rip up their'Bush-Quayle'sips." 

"It doesn't really do any good if 
they don't have an opposin, 
viewpoint present," Third ColleF 
student Jim Delfavero said. "This 
is really sort of borins, it'. like a 
mass." 

Republican demonstrators com-
plained that they were being 
treated unfairly compred to the 
way Dukatis supporters were 
handled at George Bush's rally at 
Scripps Institution of Ocean-
o8rBphy last Friday. 

According to Delfavero, Demo-
cratic party members were as-
signed a special section at Bush's 
rally. 

UCSO police officers said they 
were not restricting Bush sup-
porters from entering the rally, 
and that in fact several of them 
had been allowed in. 

One Republican supporter, 
Revelle student Alan Mirski, said 
a campaian official tapped him

Democratic vice presidential 
candidate Sen. Lloyd Bent~ 
brought his campaign to Revelle 
Plaza Monday and surprised the 
crowd by not addressing tradi-
tional campus themes like facism 
and sexism, nuclear weapons, 
disarmament or apartheid. 

Instead,lknsten got a crowd of 
around 1,500 placard-beating en-
thusiasts and onlookers excited 
with a meat and potatoes inter-
national trade speech and a dol-
lop of criticism of Republican en-
vironmental and education poli-
cies. 

"Mike Oukakis and Lloyd 
Bentsen are not going to stand 
idly by and watch America be-
come a second-rate industrial 
power," Bentsen said. 

"Y ou don't need a degree in 
economics to understand what's 
happening. Last year, of the 100 
largest companies in the world, 43 
were Japanese and 40 were Amer-
ican. This year, S3 are Japanese 
and 34 are American. 

"Now, I don't blame the Japa-
nese or the (European Commun-
ity) or Taiwan for our loss of 
world leadership ... (though) we 
can insist that if they enjoy full 
access to our markets, we're en-
titled to full access to their 
markets," the Texan said. 

But he did have blame to 
apportion. 

"For eight years now," he said, 
"we've had a Republican admin-
istration that talks about fiscal 
responsibility but never submit-
ted a balanced budget, an admin-
istration that has almost tripled 
our national debt in less than 
eight years and let our trade deficit 
increase to S 170 billion. 

"That is no way to build a 

strong, competitive economy, "he 
added. 

Bentsten's speech, unlike one 
he gave at UCLA Tuesday, con-
tained no especially harsh attacks 
on the Republican candidates, 
George Bush and Dan Quayle. 

He omitted from his speech a 
line in his prepared text charging 
that "George Bush's record on the 
environment is as empty as Oan 
Quayle's resume." 

Bentsen's reticence was not 
shared by a group of about SO 
Bush supporters, who repeatedly 
tried to interrupt the Senator's 
speech by shouting, and at one 
point reciting the Pledge of Alle-
giance in unison. 

See related story, left 
While he focused on trade 

Bentsen drew his biggest ovatio~ 
of the 2O-minute speech when he 
described fonner Environmental ' 
Protection Agency operative Ann 
Gorsuch and former Interior 

~retary Jar¥S Watt as "the 
Bonnie and Clyde of environmen-
tal protection." 

Bentsen also criticized Bush's 
education record. 

"I defy anyone here to tell me 
one thing - one single thing -
George Bush has done to further 
the cause of education in America. 

"It's one thing to say you want 
to be an education president. It's 
quite another to do what Mike 
Oukakis has done, to produce a 
record of strong support for edu-
cation, year in and year out .. 
Bentsen said. ' 

The emphasis on international 
trade pleased Vice Chancellor of 
Academic Affairs Harold Ticho 
for one. '

Vlalt -The Voters for a Democratic Republic had 
only 36 hours to prepare for Lloyd Bentsen's visit 
to campus (lower left hand). Clockwise from there, 
the Republicans tried to outshine the Democrats 
on campus with signs and shouting, but they were 
overwhelmingly outnumbered. Above, the SWAT 
team members on campus were not in the least 
inconspicious. Above right, professor Samuel 
Popkin of UCSD's Political Science Department 
introduced Bentsen. To the right the Republicans 
voice their opposition by reciting the Pledge of 
Allegiance. In the lower right hand corner, stu-
dents thronged to try to shake Bentsen's hand. 
Below Bentsen gives a final wave before leaving 
UCSD.

t----SHORTS~ 
Poster in Violation of 
UCLA Trademark Rights 

LOS ANGELES - Miller Beer and UCLA 
don't mix. 

Last week a Miller Beer poster promoting 
UCLA football appeared as an insert in the 
Daily Bruin. The poster violated UCLA trade-
mark rights and California state law, according 
to UCLA licensing director Jack Revoyr. 

The poster distribution resulted from an over-
sight in the Doily Bruin Advertising office. 
UCLA and the Bruin Bear are trademarks, and 
they generally do not appear in advertisements 
in the Daily Bruin, said Tiley Chao, Daily Bruin 
business manapr. 

Furthermore, it is the Daily Bruin J policy 
that all inserts be approved by both the business 
manaaer and the publications director. In this 
cue the Miller poster was approved by Chao 
but not submitted to the publications director, 
Terence Hscao. 

According to Chao, who gave final approval 
for the poster, her oversight was due to the tre-
mendous amount of extra work associated with 
the 2OS-page registration issue that was pub-
lished one day before the poster was distributed. 

Hsiao said the Daily Bruin advertising office 
is taking steps to ensure that this does not 
happen again. "This is something that never 
should have gone throuah," Hsiao said. 

The university and the licensing office took 
this very seriously, Revoyr said. The licensing 
office' has contacted Miller Beer and told the 
company that it violated the UCLA trademark 
and California State education code 9200. This 
code prohibits the commercial use of the UCLA 
name without permission. Violation of this code 
is a misdemeanor. 

Revoyr is waiting for a response from Miller 
before determining a course of action.

BENTSEN: Speech Focuses on Foreign Trade ArlO and Blake Hans. Those dorms, which face the 

Plaza, were not emptied by police, 
however. 

Continued from pale I 
Ticho, who, with Chancellor 

Atkinson, stood on the platform 
with Bentsen throulhout the 
Senator's appearance, said later 
he was "quite pleased with the 
emphasis in this environment 
(U CS D) on the international trade 
deficit. The training oftcchnically 
competent kinds of workers that 
will enable that deficit to come 

do ... n is important here." 
The biggest cheer of the day 

actually came for UCSD Political 
Science Professor Sam Popkin's 
introduction. Popkin drew a roar 
by telling the crowd it pleased him 
to look out and "see I'm not the 
only Democrat in La Jolla." 

Bentsen's appearance came on 
the heels of another unexpected 
campaign stop, by George Bush 

Friday at Scripps. 
Bentsen's Deputy Press Secre-

tary Ellen Moskowitz denied that 
the Bentsen campaign was en-
gaged in "counter programminl ... 

" He's emphasizing technology, 
and this is one of the places you 
go to do that. He's going to Sil-
icon Valley in San Jose this week 
too, .. she said. 

Bentsen's visit didn't create the 

disruption of campus life many 
thought it would. A few classes 
were cancelled at USB, some ac-
cess roads were blocked off to 
automobile traffic, the UCSD 
police department showed in force 
along with San Diego police and 
the Secret Service, and Secret 
Service snipers took up posts atop 

About half the Plaza wu cor-
doned off and "blue passes" given 
out to those with administrative 
orcampus Democrat connections. 

There was plenty of room for 
others, though, and the blue pass 
system was lackadaisically en-
forced .

Hunter S. Thompson 

President Bush 

T his low rent night-crawling firesale of a presidential campaign has not taught us much about the nation we all caH home - but 
every once in a while it hits a pure high note, a truly original 

flash. 
They are not always happy or comforting. but that is not the point. 

They are the moments that make politics worthwhile - when you feel 
like you finally got paid back. in kind, foraH the time and energy you've 
wasted on it. 

One of these moments came around last night just before the Bush-
Dukakis debate, when PBS put Barry Goldwater and George 
McGovern together by tube-link and asked them what they thought 
about the election. 

The result was an eerie five minutes of deja vu for a lot of people who 
never agreed on anything else in politics - except for a sudden 
realization that the two best and brightest and most honorable men to 
run for the presidency of the United States in the last 25 years were also 
the two who got beaten and trashed by the biggest margins since 
George Washington won a second term. 

Goldwater held the record briefly, after he got flogged 62-38 percent 
by Lyndon J obnson in 1964. But GeorJe lost even bigger in 1972, when 
Richard Nixon beat him by a shocking 18 million votes. 

History records these numbers mercilessly - but history also 
records that both Johnson and Nixon met a similar fate and were 
drummed out of Washington in a cloud of shame, defeat and disgrace. 
They both quit and slinlced away. 

Anyway, they are gone now. while McGovern and Goldwater are 
still with us and viewed by even their enemies as contemporary folk 
heroes ... When PBS wanted the real thing for their final pre-debate 
commentary, they called George and Barry. 

It was a brilliant stroke of political journalism but it didn't do much 
for Get Out the Vote activists on either side. 

McGovern dismissed the Democratic candidate as some kind of 
cheap robot . and Goldwater denounced Bush with such venom that 
George made a point of calling Goldwater a fool about halfway 
through his debate with Dukakis a few hours later ... Dukakis had the 
grace to not mention McGovern. but that was about the only thing he 
did right. 

T he first instant-reaction poll came from ABC, calling it 49-33 percent for Bush - which seemed like an honest count. GeorJe Bush stomped on the terra last night, and Dukakis made it easy 
for him. 

He denied or apologized for just about everything he'd ever done in 
his life except showing up for the debate, which was clearly a fatal 
mistake. 

Nobody summed it up better than a man from the Atlanta 
Constitution who said, "If it was a fight, it would have been called." 

Ex Quizzo Nobium. 
That is political shorthand for the old trial lawyers' axiom that says 

"Never ask a question unless you already know the answer ... rt makes a 
mean kind of sense that most lawyers grasp instinctively. but Michael 
Dukakis - a Harvard Law graduate and a certified shrewd politician 
- has apparently not learned that lesson, and school is oul for him 
now. There is no more time for learning. He is about to shoot the gap, 
and it will be a lonely experience. 

Not since Evel Knievel tried to jump the Snake River Gorge has any 
high-rolling fool rushed out to The Brink so utterly unprepared. 

About halfway into the debate. Dukakis was looking more and 
more like the incredible shrinking man. The fun was gone. and some of 
his staff people were seen moving nervously toward the exits. 

My own notes on the argument are extremely dense and detailed, 
but there is no point in printing them now. It would be overkill, and I 
am not in the mood for it ... 

I hurt for Dukakis last night. because I like the man and I believe he 
is a lot better than he comes across on TV - but it is hard to argue with 
the notion that anybody who can get into a high-doHar public 
argument with George Bush and come out looking like a mean dunce is 
probably not fit to be president of the United States. 

To say that Bush didn " win this election, Dukakis lost it is a baleful 
judgment on both of them, but I think it is true. 

rt was Adlai Stevenson, among others, who said, "In Q democracy. 
people gel the kind of government they deserve. " But there are some 
things that even smart people don't like to be right about, and for Adlai 
that is surely one of them. 

He must have been spinning in his grave last night, stunned by 
Dukakis' embarassing collapse. 

And he was not alone. There are a lot of us lying out here in the 
weeds today, and weare not really whooping it up ... But what the hell? 
Buy the ticket, take the ride. 

PeeWee Herman said that.

Letters 
Support the 
UFWBoycott 
EcUtor: 

This summer marks the fourth 
year of the re-instatement of 
UFW's table grape boycott. While 
the last grape boycott was fought 
for the rights of the farmworker, 
the present struggle focuses on the 
health of the consumer, the farm-
worker and the residents adjacent 
to agricultural fields . 

During this summer we, con-
cerned citizens of the UCSD 
community, became acutely aware 
of the struggle for our health 
through the 36-day fast of Cesar 
Chavez and the campaign of the 
Rev. Jesse Jacuon. The fast drew 
national attention as Chavez put 
his life on the line not only for the 
farm worker but also for the 
American consumer. 

We ask the UCSD community 
to join a nationwide movement of 
diverse groups and continue to 
increase awareness concerning the 
effects of pesticides. We invite 
you to stop buying table grapes.

Campus GOP 
Effort Lags 
EdJtor: 

I am a fresh person, and one of 
the things that excited me the 
most about coming to UCSD 
was the prospect of becoming 
politically involved. 

I am a devoted Democrat, but 
had I arrived on campus un-
decided about my party affilia-
tion. there is little doubt in my 

mind that I would have joined 
the Democrats. 

The Democrats at UCSD have 
done a far more thorough job 
than the RepUblicans of provid-
ing information about their on-
campus organizations and the 
policies of their pa.rty's presi-
dential candidate. 

The Democrats are highly 
visible on campus, having an 
information and voter registra-
tion table set up daily across 
from Revelle's Bonner Hall. They 
have frequent meetings at which 
there is a great deal of unity, 
support, and enthusiasm, evident 
in the fact that the majority of 
seats in the room, a USB lecture 
hall, are usually filled . 

In sharp contrut to this great 

Democratic effort, I have seen 
very little from campus Republi-
cans. No booth, Bush / Quayle 
campaign information or notices 
of meetin,s 'are to be found . Just 
recently have r seen Bush/ Quayle 
posters beginning to appear on 
windows of residential buildinls 
on campus. 

I wonder what the RepUblicans 
are thinking. Either they are so 
confident that the election is 
theirs that they have determined 
campaigning would be a waste of 
time. or they lack the organiza-
tion, unity, and support needed 
to campaign on campus. 

Could it be that the Repub-
licans are taking naps with 
Ronald Reagan?

Trapped in a Styro~ __ "L •• Nightmare 
Or, MyLije 
in the A.S. 

By BARD-ALAN FINLAN 
Student A d\locDtt 

Newsflash! Associated Students' 
Student Advocate Bard-Alan 
Fiolan was burned at the stake 
last Wednesday evening in front 
of the Grove Cafre after publicly 
confessing to having uttered 
criticism over the price of coffee 
at the Caffe . There was a mock 
trial at which testimony was 
heard from the managers of 
several off-campus coffee houses 
about the global shortaJe of 
coffee beans. 

At this point it was decided 
that Finlan would not be forced 
to consume mass quantities of 
styrofoam. Instead, the council 
elected to cast the cups at Fiolan, 
burying him to the neck. Then. 
a thousand points of light 
appeared in the crowd that was 
waiting to throw cups. 

Finlan appealed the decision 
to Chancellor Atkinson, who 
said to campus media, "I am 
unaware of this matter; why 
don't you consult with Joe 
Watson?" Atkinson later re-
quired the media to issue a 
statement of disclaimer of the 
incident from the responsibility 
of the ReJents. 

Joe Watson, who was initiaUy 
unavailable for comment. later 

V-
I. 

" 

was quoted as saying "We 
consider this matter closed and 
will take no further action." 

Special Services Director 
Nicholas Aguilar pleaded with 
Finlan, who assessed the matter 

, u a "burning issue," to put the 
event behind him and devote 
his time and energy to more 
productive endeavors. 

As the flames bepn to con-
sume Fiolan, Grove Carre AI-
sistant MansJer Jennie Van-
Meter remarked, "We've done 
well. No chloroflourocarbons 
will be released into the atmos-
phere while Finlan burns." A 
photographer from the Ntw 
Indicator appeared, but was 
arrested by campus police for 
biting her own lip when aiming 
the camera. 

A plea for Fiolan's life was 
aired over the campus radio 
station, but there was no re-
sponse. 

Before Finlan took his last 
breath, a hero appeared from 
the crowd by the name of 
"Maynard Dimmesdale." Dim-
mesdale insisted that the cam-
pus procedures requiring the 
privacy of student executions 
had never been approved by 
UC President David Gardner. 
and that council bylaws would 
have to be suspended to con-
tinue with the execution. 

Dimmesdale later confessed 
that he was "a card-carrying 
member of the Student Advo-
cate Office." The crowd was 
disillusioned. Having 10lt faith 
in the A.S., they bepn a march 
south, chanting to the tune of 
Alice's /Ustaurant: "You can 
Jet anything you say at the Che-
ay-ay-ay Cafe; 
You can Jet anything you say at 
the-uh-uh chc! Cafe; 
Walk rilht in, it's around the 
back, 
just a hop, skip and a jump 
from the bicycle track; 
And you can get anything you 
say at the CbC-ay-ay-ay Cafe ... " 

Finlan walked away from the 
scene and asked the proverbial 
question: " Doesn 't anybody 
listen to KSDT?" Accordinl to 
A.S. Communications Director 
Janice Williams, KSDT is pIan-
ning a public electrocution next 
Wednesday.

Fringe Worth 
Covering 
EdItor: 

The Sa" ~go U"ion recently 
ran a story explaining why they 
don' cover third party candidates. 
Ray Kipp, the political editor, 
displayed incredible iporancc by 
statin, "If we covered every 
candidate for president, the paper 
would be fuU because dozens of 
frinJe candidates run for presi-
dent." 

Perhaps if this elitiat editor 
would bother to check a few facta, 
he miaht appear more bowled.-
able. 

In California there are a total 

of five presidential candidates on 
the baUOi. BUlh and Dukakii we 
are aU too familiar with. 

Jim Griffin is runnin, on the 
American Independent Party tic-
ket, a1thouah he wiU be on the 
baUot only in California. Lenora 
Fulani, the socialist candidate, is 
runnina u an indepenedent and 
win be on the ballot in 45 ltates. 
Ron Paul, the Libertarian Party 
nominee, is on the ballot in 47 
ltates. 

MOlt people seem to be dis-
pleued with BUlh and Dubkis. 
Is it aikin, too much of our repl 
media to give rudimentary cover-
a. of thele three plucky upirants 
who battled their way onto the 
ballot?

NEwS The UCSD Guardion 
GINZBURG: A ctivistRecountsHis 
Native Country's Social Struggle 
Continued from palt 1 
had," he said. explaining that they 
had attempted to circulate their 
periodicals to foreign readers. 

A trial resulted in the incar-
ceration of the two authors, but 
was significant in that it was the 
fi rst time public support was 
marshalled for glasnost (reform 
or "openness" of social policy). It 
also resulted in Ginzburg's first 
confrontation with the KGB. 

Ginzburg, working again as a 
journalist, managed to gain access 
to a copy of the trial transcripts 
and based his first book on them. 

"[1] put my name [on the 
manuscript] and took it directly 
to the KGB," he said. Ginzburg 
threatened to malc:e the trial public 
unless the writers were released. 

"This was when the KGBwasn\ 
used to such dissident audacity," 
Ginzburg said. The confrontation 
sparked a series of events that 
ended in another prison sentell()C 
for Ginzburg and several others. 

Eventually, Ginzburg found 
that his actions, along with those 
of other dissidents, had brought 
Soviet injustice to the attention of 
thousands. 

"It was from them," Ginzburg 
said, "that we saw the emergell()C 
of the first people who were 
involved with the human rights 
movement in our country. And so 
gradually, beginning with a few 
isolated individuals and then 
extending to several thousand .. . 
something new had begun to 
emerge." 

Ginzburg then spoke about the 

Alexander Ginzburg 

present iUs of the Soviet system 
and commented on the reforms 
begun in recent years. As he spolee, 
he frequently returned to the 
metaphor of the Soviet Union as 
an ailing body. 

The Soviet Union began, 
Ginzbur, said, as a nation with an 
ideal, but "by the mid 1950's these 
ideas were totally eliminated. By 
1956, it was very hard to find ... 
anyone who believed .. . [in] social-
ism . .. the society was left without 
freedoms and without an ideol-
ogy." 

Ginzburg characterized modem 

Soviet society as "old and sick 
and no longer developing." 

In examining the currents of 
change preaently sweeping through 
the Kremlin, Ginzburg said that 
Soviet leaders are advancing the 
cause of human rights only as a 
means of pursuing their own 
interests. 

The lecturer said that Soviet 
politicians are now seeking a way 
out of contemporary dilemmas 
because they are young and foresee 
a long political future for them-
selves and want to ensure national 
prosperity for that future. 

"We must not think they 
[undertake reforms] out oCa k.ind 
heart . . . they do want to be leaders 
of a superpower," Ginzburg said. 

Economically and culturally, 
Ginzburg said, little has changed 
in the Soviet Union, but he said 
that he never thought change 
would come rapidly. 

Ginzburg did cite the govern-
ment's approval of publishing 
certain previously banned books, 
the release of most political pri-
soners, and the increase in civil 
protests in Armenia and the Baltic 
states as signs of forward move-
ment. 

"The process [will] go in [a] 
slow fashion but is irreversible." 
Ginzburg said, "and no one can 
stop [the] direction it [has] started 
in . . .1 look to the future of my 
grandchildren with great hope. " 

Ginzburg now lives in Paris 
and is an active civil rights leader. 
He spends several weeks each 
year on lecture tours. 

SUPPORTERS-----------------
Continued (rom palt I 
you have to confiscate them all," 
Dyer added, so "they started 
passing around signs of their own 
once the people got in." 

Yet a few ingenious Republi-
cans managed to enter the stage 
area incognito, and one expressed 
his opinion on the back of a 
Dubk.is sign that said "Lloyd i. a 
Loser." 

Other angry RepUblican sup-
porters did not voice frustration 
over not being let into the rally, 

but rather over not getting to hear 
what Bentsen had to say. 

Fifth College student Paul 
Varin araued that because 
Dukalc:is supports the ACLU, 
which favors free speech rights, 
keeping RepUblicans out of a 
Democratic rally "gives the im-
pression that they're hypocrites." 

Despite confusion setting into 
the rally, (Ipecial guest passes 
were required to enter the rally 
area) many Democratic student 
lupporten voiced optimism about 
Bentsen" message to the campus.

Shellah Williams. "He's got poten-

StiU others felt that it is diffacu1t 
for a politician to try to reinveat 
the wheel. Muir college senior 
JaDlCl Pinpin said he had heard it 
all before. 

"It was your standard political 
speec::h, but it seems more credible

Tunnels Intrigue TresRassing Students 

Traveling Through The Underground 
By WENDY STEINLE 
S'aff Writer 

There are myths about worlds 
that lie beneath the earth's surface. 
Some people think that Hell is 
down there, and childhood wis-
dom reveals that if you dig far 
enough, you will reach China. 

Many UCSD students are un-
aware that a world exists below 
the UCSD campus. A world of 
darkness and light; hot and cold; 
a world inhabited by wires, pipes, 
locked gates, and dust. It is the 
world of the utility tunnels, known 
to maintenance people and tres-
passers. 

"The trespassers"scc themselves 
more as explorers, or even tour 
guides. One Revelle student, who 
wished to remain unidentified 
includes the utility tunnels in his 
tour of San Diego for out of town 
visitors. 

The tunnels connect the tele-
phone and electrical wires, and 
the heating and cooling systems 
of AP&M, P&L, Central Library, 
Bio-Med, HUL, and other major 
buildings across campus. "They 
are not designed for pedestrian 
traffic, .. Detective Sergeant Robert 
L. Jones of the UCSD Police 
bepartment said. 

Rumors circulating among 
..!tudents say that the tunnels were 
built in the sixties for the con- • 
cealed movement of riot control 

troops in case demonstrations on 
the UCSD campus reached the 
caliber of those at UC Berkeley. 
However, Jones said these rumors 
are false. 

"The human imagination is a 
wonderful thing," J ones said. 
"Intriguing rumors get started 
about anything that has an aura 
of mystery." 

According to Jones, the tunnels 
are "for the maintenance of 
UCSD, and our officers only go 
down there when someone is 
trespassing. " 

Warren senior Evon Speckhard 
met such officers on a midnight 
run through the utility tunnels. 
He and four friends were arrested 
after setting off four silent alarms 
in the tunnels. 

Evon and his friends were 
arrested because unauthorized 
entrance to the tunnels is trespass-
ing, and, by law, a misdemeanor. 
When trespassers are caught, the 
police will question them to 
"determine why they are down 
there," Jones said. 

The incident will go into a 
police flIe, and if the same person 
is caught again the flIe will be sent 
either to the city attorney's office 
for trespassing, or to the student 
conduct coordinator, who deals 
with student misconduct. The case 
is then referred to the respective 
college dean, who decides on a 
disciplinary action, Jones said . 

It is a security issue u '"e",U, 
according to Jones. "For that 

reason, there is an alarm at every 
entrance to the tunnels from a 
building. If people get into the 
tunnels undetected, they cannot 
go very far without coming to a 
locked gate. All gates in the tunnels 
have alarms." 

Despite the possible conse-
quences, the intrigue of the un-
known draws adventurous stu-
dents to explore the tunnels. "It is 
kind oflike Mission Impossible," 
said Revelle senior Tony Rolfe. 

Like many students, Rolfe first 
heard ofthe tunnels from rumors 
circulating through the dorms. 
Rolfe said, "It sounded like some-
thing to try." 

With seven friends, Rolfe 
entered the tunnels through a 
grate in a laundry room in 
Beagle Hall which has since been 
sealed off. "I did not really know 
what the consequences were," 
Rolfe said. 

In the tunnels, Rolfe and his 
friends walked from the Revelle 
mud huts to the Bio-Medical 
library and found that there are 
lights throughout the tunnels. No 
darkness, no vampires, no rats, 
only pipes and dust. In spite ofthe 
lights, Rolfe said that "everything 
scared you. 

He added, "we got to a locked 
gate and could not go any farther 
without setting off an alarm. 
Something made a clanking noise 
beyond the ga~ - we did some 
running on the way back." 

,---:--- Muir junior Randy Dotinga 
said, "Going down there was the 

t-:-...."..-,......,---,,...-....;....-.,..--H--+---+--------'--:'-i .. C':d~+ biggest adventure of my life. 1be 

worst part was getting stuck in a 
_ narrow opening trying to get out. .. 

The intrigue of trespassing in 
- the tunnels "is a lot like when you 

are a little kid and you run across 
the street without looking because 

know that you are not 
supposed to," Rolfe said. 

Senior Julian Thomas went into 
the tunnels to satisfy his curiosity. 
In a group of ten, Thomas entered 
the tunnels through a manhole 
and walked toward the hump. 
Ahead of them, they saw a 
bouncing light and heard voices. 
They thought they were caught. 

"There was no place to hide," 
Thomas said. He and his friends 
were relieved to find out the 
approaching people were "three 
other students who were just as 
scared as we were." 

Aside from the danger of run-
ning into unidentified people, there 
are potentially serious physical 
danlen in the tunnels. 

If one tries to enter the tunnels 
through a manhole, the 7S pound 
manhole cover must be dealt with. 
To reach the floor of the tunnel, 
one must climb down a 40 foot 
suspended metal ladder. "You arc 
hanging onto the rungs forty feet 
in the air, and it is easy to slip," 
Speckard said. 

According to Detective Jones, 
a person could get burned from 
accidentally rubbing up against 
the pipes that are in the tunnels. 
Aside from being burned, "A 
person could get electrocuted or 
trapped, and we [would] have no 
way of knowing that [he or she] is 
down there, " according to Jones. 

"The potential dangers and 
security issues involved make us 
hold our position [of discouraging] 
people from going down into the 
tunnels," Jones said . . 

"In the past three years, the 
interest level has declined, due in 
part to increaaed security systems 
and to the declined popularity of 
the game 'Dungeons and Drag-
ons, - according to Jones. 

The buildinl of the tunnels is 
an ongoing procesi. As new 
buildinp are added to the campus, 

their air conditioning and electri-
cal systems must be connected to 
the main system which runs 
through the tunnels. 

"A tunnel to reach the Engineer-
ing building is under construction 
now," Jones said. 

After exploring the tunnels, 
Thomas said, "It's no big deal." 
Another explorer said, "The whole 
place is covered with dust, you 
come out dirty." 

Jones emphasized that "It is 
not worth it to 80 down there and 
explore when you might have to 
suffer some consequences, as rar 
as the University is concerned." 

When there are consequences 
to suffer, why do people go down 
to the utility tunnels? Like many 
other explorinl trespassers, 
Thomas answered, "We had no-
thinl better to do."

Chilean Refugee Looks 
back at Homeland 

Editor's Note: ·This is part two 
of a two-part series. The first 
part ran in ,he Monday, Oct. 17 
issue of the Guardian. 

By JULIE MUNRO 
Fea'ures Editor 

Cecilia Ubilla-Arenas, coordi-
nator of the UCSD OASIS Lan-
guage Program, would not feel 
safe in her home country, Chile, 
"until real democracy is restored," 
she said. 

Ubilla-Arenas went under-
ground in Chile after the 1973 
military coup because , she was 
known to be a supporter of the 
overthrown Allende government. 

She surfaced after the military 
junta made threats to anyone 
remaining underground. The 
school teacher was then interro-
gated for a period of time before 
being put in jail, and was finally 
allowed to exchange her jail sent-
ence for house .arrest. 

None of the th'iiieen counts she 
was charged with were ever pro-
ven, but she was kept under 
observation like thousands of 
other Chileans. This "was a way 
to neutralize those people who 
had been very politically involved 
with the Allende government," 
she said. 

Ubilla-Arenas attended gradu-
ate school in Texas in the '6Os. The 
'friends' she made in the United 
States were very concerned about 
her after the military coup. They 
heard she had been assasinated, 
but they persisted in trying to con-
tact and help her in the hope that 
she was still alive. 

Her friends in the United States, 
she said, were really responsible 
for getting her out of Chile. One 
friend tried repeatedly to call her 
in Chile and finally reached her at 
her school. Two people were sent 
to listen in. Her friends in the Uni-
ted States had organized a dem-
onstration of thousands of people 
and hooked the phone up to a 
loud speaker. 

When they asked her if she 
needed anything, she decided to 
say, "I need you, I need you, 
please help me. Get me out of 
here, get me out of here." The 
men at Ubilla-Arenas' side told 
her to hang up. 

These friends sent help to her, 
and eventually sent her an appli-
cation for the University of Cali-
fornia. She was accepted at UCSD 
and her friends called attention to 
her, writing their congressmen 
and the United States embassy in 
Chile. So, she was given a pass-
port out of the country. Ubilla-
Arenas highly encourages groups 
such as Amnesty International to 
do this type of work for others in 
situations similar to her own.

Ubilla-Arenas originally joined 
the staff of the OASIS writing 
center, but she sa w students could 
use help with foreign languages 
and English as a second language 
(ESL) as well as just writing in 
English. 

A language program grew from 
her suggestions, with input from 
all the writing coordinators. 
Ubilla-Arenas is now the coordi-
nator of the OASIS language 
program which in 1982, when it 
began, had SO students and 100 
contacts (a 30-minute meeting) 
and in 1987 grew to 400 students 
and 1200 contacts. 

Ever since she arrived in the 
United States in 1974, she has 
spoken out against Pinochet's 
government. She works at "de-
nouncing the human rights viola-
tions and the illegality of the 
entire resime," she said. 

On Oct. S there was a plebiscite 
in Chile, a simple "yes" or "no" 

vote for or against Pinochet (the 
leader of the military junta). 
Pinochet lost. 

Ubilla-Arenas said it would be 
naive to think the plebiscite will 
change the issue of democracy in 
Chile overnight, but it is a first 
step of a process that should be 
taken care of very carefully. To

observer of the plebiscite. He was 
surprised at the honesty with 
which the elections were held. 
Drake said Pinochet called the 
plebiscite assuming he would win . 
Drake will be giving a talk on the 
situation in Chile on Oct. 20 at 
3:30 pm at the Institute of the 

America~. 
The military junta did acknow-

lege that the votes against the cur-
rent government, the "no" option, 
were 56 percent, indicating the 
public's disapproval of the Pino-
chet government and favoring the 
calling of a general election in one 
year. 

"The polls taken among the 
people by experts indicate that 
the percentage must have been 
much higher than 53 or 56 per-
cent," Ubilla-Arenas said. "All of 
a sudden Pinochet sees the people 
saying, 'do not wait for a year, 
resign now,' and that was a very 
strong message." 

"The generals knew all along 
they wanted to get rid of Pinochet, 
but ... they did not want to 
change the system. What they 
probably want is another penon 
there instead of Pinochet. They 
do not want to yield to the pro-
gressive sector of Chile," she said. 

1The Generals] have the power 
of the gun. The people have the 
power' of their conscience, their 
minds, their hearts, and they have 
the streets. They can continue to 
demonstrate; they can also be 
killed," Ubilla~Arenas said. 

She believes this is an impor-
tant moment and feels the opposi-
tion (a combination of independ-
ents, Marxists and Christians) 
needs to unify behind more than 
just getting rid of Pinochet, in 
spite of their wide range of philo-
sophical and political ideas. She 
believes that, in spite of pressure 
from the military junta and the 
United States, the opposition 
needs to stop excluding particular 
sections and parties because there 
is room for all trains of thought in 
the opposition. 

"The United States is, 1 am 
sure, very interested in seeing 
Pinochet out, but also very inter-
ested in seeinl the Marxist or lef-
tist sector of Chile not get involved 
heavily in decidinl what Chile is 
loinl to be like," Ubilla-Arenas 
said. 

She would like the opposition 
to rej9Cl the timetable of events 
for upcomina elections, set up by 
Pinochet, and give the military 
junta another timetable suitable 
to the opposition. She would also 
like to see the constitution re-
jected. These thinp, she said, 
"would be a sign of real power." 

There are several possibilities, 
Ubilla-Arenas said, for Chile's 
future. Someone else could be 
elected, there could be another 
coup, or they could simply replace 
Pinochet with another general to 
create the appearance of a demo-
cratic system. 

There are a few thinp Ubilla-
Arenas says can not be nelo-
tiated. "Human rights cannot be 
negotiated, political prisoners 
cannot be negotiated, accounting 
for the people who are missing." 
What can be negotiated are the 
things such as the terms of elec-
tions or whether or not Pinochet 
is senator for life.

Pinochet himself planned the 
plebiscite after a plot to eliminate 
him failed. Pinochet came up 
with the idea because he was sure 
he would win, Ubilla-Arena said. 

.. He also did not read the power 
of all these people in the streets. 
Of course, he has the weapons. If 
he decides to, he can massacre 
them, but the whole world knows 
now," she said. 

Thousands of international 
journalists and observers went to 
Chile for the elections. Pinocbet 
has never liked the foreip lIJedia, 
Ubilla-Arenas said. The only real 
victory for the reponers, ahe said, 
was that they made a fool of him 
when two film makers from West 

Germanya~vedinSantialoand 
said they were from Germany. 

''The great thing 
would be to restore 
democracy, so that 
some of us can go 
back." 

-C. Ubilla-Arenas 

The Pinochet government gave 
the reporten access to an its faci1i-
ties and gave candid interviews, 
thinking the reporters were from 
East Germany. Tbe reporters 
made a fllm and left the country. 
Then, when it was too late, it wu 
explained that the fllmmaken 
were from democratic West Ger-
many. 

Ubilla-Arenas said tbat Chile is 
fun of people with a great deal of 
political awareness. Although this 
is a positive element, the country 
faClCS the problem ' of political 
groups splittiq into factions that 
all have special interests. 

"Because you understand polit-
ics wen. because you do know the 
implications of goilll this way 
the other, you proceed cau-
tiously," she said. "But the areat 
thing to do would be to restore 
democracy, so tbat some of us can 
10 back." 

There are many people Ubilla-
Arenas would like to 10 and visit, 
and sbe would love to live in 
"beautiful" Chile, ahe said, but "I 
do not feel safe there." 

A few days before the plebis-
cite, Pinochet issued an autbori-
zation for all Cbileana to return to 
Chile, but Ubilla-Arenu said the 
decree was simply COimetiC be-
cause the fine print said all those 
who left with cbarpa would bave 
to come back and f8(:C the courts. 

She left Chile lepny with the 
court sayinl nothing had been 
proven "for the time being. " But 
she said, "that worried me a lot, 
'for the time beina;' thiop can 
always be reopened." She also 
said her association with the 
former governrpent would make 
finding a job difficult. It would 
also be difficult, Ihe said, to 
remain silent. 

Althoulh such famous people 
as Allende" widow (Allende led 
Chile before Pinochet) have re-
turned to Chile safely, Ubilla-
Arenas pointed out that les. 
famous people may not be 10 
secure. She cited three teachers 
who returned and talked about 
what it was like to live in exile, 
how they missed their country. 
She said two of them were found 
in the outskirts of Santialo with 
their throats cut.

Defense Does It Again: Shutout No. 13 
Backfield Key to Team's Success Division II 

Chapman Goes 
Down, 3-0 By MOLLY MCK.A Y CO"tributinJ Writer 

Research and development is 
currently underway for the wo-
men's soccer team's new secret 
weapon, Superior Impenetrable 
Defense (SID). This one-of-a-kind 
fighting unit has been instrumen-
tal in creatina the Tritons' un-
believable record of I ~ I this 
season. 

The components of SID are 
goalie Julie Freiss and defenders 
Toni Krumme, Susan Kramer, 
Amy Wayte, Robbie Levene, Lisa 
Lubeley, Jennifer Kingsbury, 
and DanieUe Placek. Kingsbury 
helped solidify the defense when 
she moved from the halfback to a 
fullback position. "She adds speed 
and great side tackle," said 
Krumme. Together these parts 
make up the toughest defensive 
ensemble in the league. 

The key to the Triton defense 
this season is the trust and confi-
dence which has been built up 
over the past three years. "Most 
of us have been playing together 
for a long time, which helps us 
work better as teapl players," Lube-
ley said. DanieUe Placek will add 
necessary freshness to the team in 
addition to making up for some 
of the loss when Kramer, the only 
four-year senior, graduates. 
. UCSD does not offer any 
financial benefits to its athletes. 
Therefore, the woinen who become 
involved with soccer do so because 
they love the game. This makes 
the Tritons a more motivated and 
focused team than most. "We are 
aU natural athletes, and we are 
here to stay in shape and playa 
good game of soccer," Kramer 
said. UCSD athletes have the 
highest GPA of any of the UC 
schools. 

Aggression is the most impor-
tant quality for a defensive player, 
but timing and calmness are also 
essential. "We have to know when 
to rush and when to hang back, " 
Kramer said. "If we panic, we are 
lost. We not only need to be 
watching our direct opponent, 
but we also need to know every-
thing that is occurring on the 
flCld." 

Communication is anotber 
tactic that the defense employs. 
"Because we have been playing 

together for a lon, time, we know 
everyone's personal strengths and 
weaknesses, which helps us know 
where and how the play will go," 
Lubeler said. 

The relationship between the 
players and c:oac:b Brian McManus 
is a close but relaxed one. "He is 
casual at practices and off the 
field, " Lubeley pointed out. "But 
when it comes to a ame. he's aU 
business." "He knows what we 
can do and expects us to do our 
best," Kramer added. "His casual 
strategy is successful because we 
act enough stress in schooL It keeps 
our team caring about each other. " 

All agree t.hat their best game 
was apinst Cal-State Dominguez 
Hills ... It was the first game where 
everyone went all out, and truly 
worked together as a single unit," 
Krumme stated. "We don' neces-
sarily consider a I()'() win a good 
game. The competitive teams are 
the games that count. They make 
us work hard for a win. " 

Mind over matter pushes the 
team to put forth 100% through-
out the entire game. "It's a matter 
of concentrating on the players 
around you and sticnn, to your 
player like glue," ,Lubeley said. 
Mental preparation begins long 
before the game. The Iciller instinct 
is helpful.

in our way. The other teams will 
keep us on our toes, fine-tuned

To the UCSD women's soccer 
team, there seems to be no dif-
fereJl4;e between Division II and 
Division III competition this year. 
On TUCICIay, the Tritons cruised 
past Division II opponent Chap-
man College 3-0 to improve their 
record to I~I for the IC&IOD. 

The Tritons proved to be too 
powerful - both offensively and 
defensively - throupout. the

the Chapman defense, kickiq 13 
shots on the ChapDWl loal. At 
the same time, UCSD held 
Chapman to only three shots on 
goal as the Triton defense con-
sistently kept the ball on the 
Chapman half of the field. 

Katy Dulock, who has already 
let the new Triton linaJe-season 
record for ,oals, scored the fmt

Water Polo Crushes Pomona-Pitzer 
Team Plays Games During 17-3 Whitewashing 

By CHRIS ZAHARIAS 
Comrib"ti", Writer 

To aU but the regular fans at 
the UCSD Men's Water Polo 
games, Tuesday's 17-3 thrashing 
of the Pomona-Pitzer Sagehens 
was anything but ordinary. That 
is, unless you consider dancing 
and rock-paper-scissors parts of 
the average game. 

In case you weren't there 
against the Sagehens, the now 13-
9 Tritons worked on their dancin' 
defense, roughly the equivalent of 
Georsetown's in-your-face , 
swarming defense employed by 
coach John Thompson in this 
summer's Olympic games. 

In UCSD's dancin' D., the 
players worked at putting pres-
sure on the outside players to try 
to force a bad shot, while still get-
ting back to help out in the post. 

Fortunately, coach Denny 
Harper's version worked better 
than Thompson's did against the 
Soviets. (The Russians beat the 
U.S. in the semi-finals by a con-
vincing margin). In the first two 
periods, the Tritons aUowed no 
goals, let alone any decent shots 
by the Sage hens while connecting 
for eleven of their own. 

"We have to execute our dan-
cin' defense perfectly on Friday 
against UC Irvine," Harper said 
after the game. If they execute this 

upcoming game in the fashion of 
their game against the Sagehcns, 
there is little doubt the Tritons 
will pull an upset over the 6th-
ranked Anteaters. 

When a four-meter call came 
up in the third period, an unmer-
ciful Harper requested that two 
Triton players "ro-sbam-bo" to 
determine who would shoot the 
penalty shot. Rock (junior Jean-
Paul Beay) beat scissors, rock 
scored, and the score became 16-
2. Obviously, this was not a close 
game. 

The 8th-ranked Tritons next 
game will be at UC Irvine, and 
don't be surprised if they use dan-
cin' and ro-sham-bo again. Hey, 
don' argue with success!

The UCSD Guardian NEWS Thur$day, October 20, 1988 13 
Council Resolution what the hell are we doina?" various committees. 

A.S. Considers Next Council; 
Sets Aside 510,000 For Future 

Vice-President of Finance Ed-
uardo Rallo-Verdugo agreed with 
Judaken and told the Council 
that with the current growth of 
UCSD "this is not a year to limit 
ourselves." 

In other financial matters, the 
A.S. agreed to allocate $.500 in 
"discretionary funding" for Pub-
lic Relations Commissioner Tom 
Rhee. 

Some members voiced concern 
that the A.S, was blindly appoint-
ing students to committees in 
which both the A.S. and the stu-
dents "don't know what they'l 
wind up doing." 

Student Advocate Bard-Alan 
Finlan argued that "with so many 
appointments, no one in the A.S. 
can look into [the appointments)." By DA VID BROOKS 

Senior Staff Writer 

The A.S. Council passed a con-
troversial resolution Wednesday 
night setting aside $ 10,000 in 
unallocated funds for the incom-
ing 1989 student government. 

Council member Luis Ramirez 
stated that the resolution was a 

"great piece of P.R." and would 
make "[this] council look really 
good." 

The resolution's intent, accord-
ing to bill sponsor President 
Maynard Dimmesdale, is based 
entirely "on consideration for the 
next council." 

Dimmesdale pointed out that 
his council wa& left with a min-
imal amount of money and that 

the setting aside of the $ 10,000 is 
"extremely appropriate ," 

However, Programming Com-
missioner Jonathan Judaken 
countered that Dimmesdale is 
"guided by an unjustified para-
noia" of overspending. 

Referring to the bill as a poten-
tial "logistical mess" Judaken 
argued that "if we can't make 
responsible fiscal decisions, then 

Normally, a commissioner must 
seek Council approval before 
spending. The allocation permits 
Rhee to use the S500 at his discre-
tion when last-minute events must 
be quickly publicized.

Defense 
Condnued from pap 12 
players can easily fill in without 
detriment to our unity," Kramer 
pointed out_ 

The weapon is now past its 
testing period and is ready for 
deployment. The outlook is opti-
mistic that this new and improved 
system of defense is the key to 
going aU the way. "We have the 
best chance we have ever had at 
winning the nationals. We aU 
have to want it, but anything is 
possible this year," Kramer said . 

UCSD recorded its 15th win of 
the year yesterday by defeating 
Chapman College,~. The victory 
marked the 13th shutout of the 
season that this steel-cunain of a 
defense has recorded. 

WJan .-all GIID,dUm 
The Triton defense may be 

amazing, but Kalyn Shea and the 
Trjton offense kept the pressure 
on Chapman College all day. 

W.Soccer 
Continued from pa.e 12 
additional aoal_ 

The second goal occurred at 
48: II when senior Susan Kramer 
headed in a pass off a Triton 
penalty kick. The All-American 
fuUback, as she has been doing aU 
year, also contributed to many 
big defensive plays that allowed 
UCSD to sustain the offensive 
pressufe on Chapman. 

A penalty kick off the foot of 
Heather Mauro at 86:44 proved 
to be the final goal for the Tritons_ 
This came as a result of Mauro 
being roughed up in the Chapman 
g~1 area. 

The shutout was the 13th of the 
season for the Tritons, and their 
seventh in the last eight games_ 
With only three games left before 
the playoffs, UCSD is setting 
some lofty, yet quite believable 
goals for the season. 

"Our goal is to finish the season 
undefeated," explained Head 
Coach Brian ' McManus. "This 
would make us the first Division 
III school in the Far West Region 
to ever accomplish this feat." 

This Sunday the Tritions will 
square off against a very formi-
dable opponent when Division 11 
UC Irvine arrives here to playa 
2 p.m. game.

up a 
pushing them 

marlc in only three weelcs! WOW! 
guess there'. always next year. But for now, keep 

up the good attitude lind THIS IUD'S FOR YOU. 

Bud Min', Formull: 
Rlllni Til, 1M T,.ml 
I know you have wondered many times 

how the BudMan can incredibly come up 
with all the ratings and be right 100% of the 
time. This guy must be amazing. Or maybe 
your team was 7-0 and was not rated. You 
thought how can that idiot BudMan not rate 
our bitchin ', fer-out teaml 

Well. since it is close to the beginning of 
the year. I, the masterful one, thought it time 
to explain the mystery of lhe all -important 
""'. _IIkI, ........ Here is my len-
point formula for determining the ratings. 
Read them and pay anenlion if you wanno 
see your team in the" ...... 
I . 1All1lA1 •• - Number one and very, 
very important is the hated "Sandbagging 
system." If it is determined that your team 
defeated all your opponents 70-0 in Single 
'A' but lost in the final by one, and you sign 
up for single 'A' the next year you likely will 
not be rated or moved up to 'AAA'_ Your 
team has now fallen into the category of the 
hated "Sandbaggers", number I enemy of 
the intramural program. 
2, IIU ..... UP TIE ICOIIE • To the surprise 
of some, scoring lots of point. does not 
enhence your chances of moving up in the 
ratings. Hey, a win's a win, dogmeall Don't 
emberass your fellow students. You know 
the team you run the score up on may have 
many of your future TAl on ~ . They may not 
get mad but they may get even. By the way if 
your leam is caught calling a timeout when 
you have the ball and leading by 40 with 
twenty seconds to go, don'1 ever look for 
your team in the ratings. 
3. TEAl .AIE - Oh boy, the all important 
team name! You can have the loullest team 
in all of IMs, but if you have that real clever 
team name you can count on a high rating. 
Think about it - have you taken more time 
this quarter to practice or to pick that perfect 
leam name? 

4. TEAl U.lfllll.· This is a very tricky 
category. Vou have to do this just right. No 
uniform can hurt you unless you look like 
Hudson Elliott . It's lhe ones who have, uni· 
forms lhat must be careful. Show imagina-
tion. Combining the team name and the uni-
form is thought of highly. Something like 
"The Nerds" team all showing up dressed 
like a nerd. What can hurt you Is looking too 
professional, like the guys that so"ball 

pants, sanitary socks and stirrups in 1M 
so"oall. 

5. TNE IIINT ATTITUIE · This is highly 
important.l,.s easy to see ~ the right attitude 
is there. II a team plays like they'll win 20 
gra nd for every game like it is the Super 
Bowl, thalleam i8 too competilive. You guys 
should go have a few Buds and then ~ome 
back with the right att~ude. You aren't golng 
to be rated anyway. SO why not turn your 
thinking around and start enjoying life! 
.. TEAl AfFIUTAItI. - This can help or hurt 
you. If you are a student organization that 
Idenllfies with Budweiser such as RISC you 
can count on a high rating. If you Ire an 
academic department that barbecues and 
brews at all games like Biology you can 
count on a high rating. Fraternities and Sor-
orities are in or out depending on how the 
BudMan was treated at the weekend party . 
II he wasn1 invited, forget ~! 
7. ICIUTIII • Scouting Is not as important 
as some of the other categories, but this can 
swing the difference between ninth and 
tenth in the ratings. if you are a team that 
does a lot of advance scouting you're tavor-
ably looked upon. It must mean you enjoy 
the sport and want to know what tha other 
teams are doing. But ~ goea a little over-
board and can hurt your ratings when you 
bring out the video camera to tape your 
future opponents games. 
I. HIll. TIlE II ITAfF AHUT .T .n-
nH UTEI· This is an absolute sure fire 
way to not get rated. Since the 1M staff are 
the only ones who know how to get informa-
tion to me they can be abused by rlting 
hounds. "Why wasn't I rated higher" or 
"How come we weren't rated" translates 
into " You'll never get rated, monkey breath'" 
'0 lllllEl' - Now if you really want 10 get 
rated, I am definitely nol above a bribe now 
and then. In lact, I can be leached in the Pub 
Monday through Sunday from 12 noon to 1 0 
pm if you want to buy me a pitcher Or lwo. A 
rating hear is guaranteed. 
10. .I./LIIT IIECOn - You'd think that 
your won / lost record is all important. That's 
not always true. Sometimes a team with an 
unblemishad record may be rated behind a 
team with one or more losses. You might 
wonder how can that happen? Well, I sug-
gest you go back and "ad Nos. 1-9 in the 
BudMan's formula . Your anS_r lies within!

Life of lies 
by donovan roche 

hianu intern 

Running on Empty is an honest film abouta family trapped in 
a life of lies - a family that has 
been paying for its past mistake 
for 15 years, and will continue to 
dolO. 

Running on Empty is not specifi-
cally about the '60&, or about 
politics, but the contemporary 
story uses both as a springboard 
for something with more sigoi-

ficance. 
On the surface, the film seems 

to have one message - every 
action has a consequence, but 
underneath the surface there are 
many layers, and each has its own 
message. 

Arthur and Annie Pope Oudd 
Hirsch and Chriatine Lahti) are 
former radicals who, in 1971, 
exercised their anti-war activism 
by blowinK-up a Kovernment-
funded napalm laboratory. 

The Pope famil, (l-T) Dann, (Rim' Phoenix), Annie (Christine Lahti), 
Arthvr (Judd Hirsch) and Ha", (Jonas Abry). 

The bombing unintentionally 
blinded and maimed a janitor. 
The Popes realized that once ar-
rested their two-year-old son, 
Danny, would be taken from them. 
So they were forced to flee "under-
ground" in order to keep the fam-
iiy together. 

Fifteen years later, as the film 
begins, the POpel are leaving a 
Greenpeace meeting and their two 
sons are waiting for them. Danny 
(River Phoenix) is now seventeen, 
his brother, Harry, Oonas Abry) 
is ten. As their parents' car pulls 
up alongside them, Danny says, 
"We got shoes. Two cars, four 
Feds." The simple phrase says it 
all - it's time to run again. 
Tomorrow they will be in a new 
house, in a new town, with a new 
hair color and a new name. 

Although this is the only life the 
boys have ever known, it has 
taken its toll, especiall yon Danny. 
"It's wonderful having a new name 
every six months," he says to his 
mother sarcastically. It's difficult 
enough to cope with ongoing 
change, much less an adolescent 
who has yet to formulate a solid 
identity. 

Even so, Danny doesn't have 
much trouble integrating into his 
new surroundings. His music 
teacher, Mr. Phillips, (Ed Crow-
ley) is immediately taken with 
Danny's talent as a classical pian-
ist. In fact, he recommends that 
Danny apply to Julliard. 

This marks the onset of the 
underlying tension in the film -
the threat to the family via Dan-
ny's natural desire to be the indi-
vidual he needs to be. The threat 
resides in the simple fact that they 
cannot leave any traces, becau,se 
once those traces are discovered 
they must once again flee . • 

The Popes live a simple life. In 
some respects, reminiscent of a

time 10nK ago - when American 
families were still together. Their 
clothes come from thrift shops 
and the lost and found of Ii braries 
and movie theaters. Their defini-
tion of a gift is something you can 
make or find (Danny goes "shop-
ping" for his mother's birthday 
present at the beach). 

But to say the Popes are a tight-
knit family does not do them jus-
tice. The irony of the Popes' con-
dition is the fact that they once 
believed they could change the 
world, and today that belief has 
closed the door of opportunities 
on them. All they have now is 
each other. 

In a crucial scene, Arthur tells 
his son, Danny, "We are a unit. 
We're only as good as our weakest 
link." Their circumstances may be 
unique, but many of the issues 
they are dealillK with are- univer-
sally significant and bring forth 
soberiOi questions concerning the 
plight of the American family. 

Running On Empty's director, 

Sidney Lumet, has a history of 
directing films with social signifi-
cance and this one can be added to 
his impressive list which spans 
thirty years. Lumet's thirty-eight 
films have received more than 
'fO Oscar nominations. Four of 
those filma, Twelve Angry Men 
(1957), Dog Da, Afternoon (1975), 
Network (1976), and The Verdict 
(1982) receives both Best Film 
and Best Director nominations. 

Running On Empty was cast as 
an ensemble piece, which means 
there is no single character with a 
larger role than the others. This 
enabled the cast to deliver believ-
able, first-rate performances. From 
the stubborn father whoee main 
concern is keeping the family 
together, to Danny's sassy girl-
friend (Martha Plimpton) who 
thinks Danny deserves his own 
chance, to the sympathetic momer 
who can't stand to see the chains 
around her boy, to Danny, the 
boy who must choose between his 
family and his individuality.

conCerto charm 
by arthur uh 

hiatw writer 

The San Diego Symphony 
opened Oct. 14 with a seamless; 
performance by twin brother 
pianists Richard and John Conti~ 
·guglia of Mendelssohn 's Con~ 
certo in E Major for Two Pianos 
and Orchestra. The concerto, writ~ 
ten by Mendelssohn at the age of 
fourteen, is a lyrical blend of 
youthful exuberance and charm. 
The two piano parts interweave, 
blend, and race with a .grace that 
made me lean back and just close 
my eyes. The Contiguglias' per~ 
formance reflected a lifetime of 
duo piano performance. The br~ 
thers played with harmony and 
continuity, animating beautifully 
the interplay of the piano parts.

breathtaking. It was written by 
Mendelssohn to highlight the key~ 
board virtuosity of his sister, for 
whom the piece was originally 
written. The movement has three 
parts, the first two of which start 
with solos. The third highlights 
both parts. , 

The combination is wonderful; 
a lyrical musical image of youth. 
The Contiguglias, though in their 
fifties, brought to life this piece 
written by a prodigious teenager. 

The evening started with 
Mozart's Symphony No. 39, per~ 
formed warmly and richly by the 
orchestra, then was followed by 
the piano concerto. After inter~ 
mission, the program jumped 
ahead half a century to 
Tchailcovsky's Symphony No.4, 
a weighty piece about an unsuc~ 
cessful struggle for self~fulfill~ 
ment.

The trumpet motif that starts 
the piece represents a kind of cruel 
fate that recurs throughout the 
piece. The performance was a 
genuine success. Conducting with~ 
out a score, Leopold Hager 
brought out the unique urgency 
and weariness of the piece. 

The trumpet entrances were as 
they should have been and not 
intrusive. Especially impressive 
was the treatment of the first 
movement which contains a build~ 
ing tension achieved through over~ 
lapping rhythmic patterns. It was 
contained yet seemed as if it would 
overflow at any moment into a 
dark morrass. 

Tonight and t(>morrow, Oct. 
20 and 21, the symphony will 
present Wagner's Siegfried Id:yll
