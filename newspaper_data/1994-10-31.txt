SANTA BARBARA - Teams 
of volunteen armed with walkie-
talkies and video cameras walked 
the streets of Isla Vista Saturday 
in an effort to observe and record 
the actions of local police. Re-
ports of overzealous policC dur-
ing lut year's Halloween cel-
ebration prompted the group'. 
formation this year. The group, 
organized with the help of the 
UCSB Associated Students, took 
notes and filmed police arrests 
from 9 to 11 p.m. The volunteer 
group spent S 1,500 renting 2S 
radios and six video cameras to 
ensure that any police miscon-
duct wu recorded. The volun-
teen, dressed in bright orange 
hats and armbands, will also walk 
the streets tonight.

female San Diego State student 
was sexually assalted in broad 
daylight earlier this month. The 
description of the suspect in this 
case closely resembles a suspect 
from another assault which took 
place at SDSU last month. Cam-

shortly after 10 a.m. on Oct. 11

Gun"'" Reporter 

Dr. Frantz Delva, former public health advi-
sor ~ Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, 
denounced the United States invasion and oc:cu-
pation of Haiti, duringa campus lecture Wednes-
day. 

Delvasaid that the United States' policy in 
Haiti has not stabilized the nation. "Are we 
really reinstalling democracy in Haiti with an 

occupation?" Delva asked. "I've never seen that 
in my whole life." 

Acc:ording to Delva, U.S. officials helped 
plan the Sept. 29, 1991 coup which forced 
Aristide to flee from Haiti. 

"The weapons used during the coup were 
U.S.-made weapons and provided by the U.S. 
Embassy," he said. Delva added, however, that 
it could not be proved that the embassy offi-
cially ac:tecI for the United States government. 

·During'the lecture, Delva also said he was

Refuse to 
Budge onASE 
LABOR: Chancellor Atkinson 
says university will not yield 
'voluntarily' to grad students 
By EIIubetII Meek .... 
Staff Writer 

UCSD administrators reaffirmed their oppo-
sition to student employee unionization during 
a meeting with the Association of Student Em-
ployees/ United Auto Workers (ASEI UA W) 
Thursday morning. 

The meeting was organized in response to a 
sit-in staged at Chancellor Richard Atkinson's 
office last week by 35 graduate students who 
demanded an appointment with the chancellor 
to discuss recognition of the ASEI VA Was the 
representative body for academic student em-
ployees. 

At the meeting, Atkinson released a written 
statement denying recognition of student em-
ployee unions. 

"The UC position is that student employees 
are students first and that T Aships and RAships 
are a part of graduate education. We believe this 
position is in the best interest of current and 
fiHure students. Thus we will not voluntarily 
grant recognition to a union as the exclusive 
representative of student employees," Atkinson 
wrote. 

However, graduate student Molly Rhodes 
said she thought the meeting went welL"'lt was 
pretty much what we expected. We were pleased 
that the chancellor came," adding that the ASEI 
UA W had never had the opportunity to meet 
with Atkinson. "Hopefully we'v"e given [the 
administration] some things to think about," 
Rhodes said. 

Associate Chancellor Linde Nagata charac-
terized the meeting as "A very courteous, gen-
eral discussion." Nagata said that although a 
difference of opinion exists, both sides were 
respectful and cordial. 

"I think [the graduate stude~ts] understand 
that [Atkinson] is not in a position to recognize 
them," Nagata added. 

The ASEI UA W represents teaching assis-
tants, resident assistants, readers, tutors and 
acting instructors. 

However, campus administrators have con-
sistently refuseC!l to grant powers ot collective 
bargaining to the organization, arguing that mem-
ben are students first, and employees second. 

The ASEI UA W is currently involved in a 
legal battle with UCSD administrators, demand-
ing a secret ballot election for readers, tutors and 
acting instructon supervised by the California

According to Dtlva, much of 
Haiti's bou!>les can be traced to a 
class struggle. Aristide is strongly 
supported by Haitians because of 
his work to alleviate class divi· 
sions. "For [Ariatide), liberation 
means that everybody has the right 
to go to 1Cboo1, has the right to 
work, to have a job, health care, not 
just one elite," Celva said.

of the mass exodus of Haitians to 
the United States. "We will see the 
reasons for the flow of rafts. These

thought their problems were over, "

At Berkeley, the administration 
voluntarily agreed to recognize the 
right of readers, tutors and acting 
instructors to unionize before the 
case was fully litigated. 

However, UCSD administrators 
say that because the Berkeley case

set a legal precedent.

4 OPINION 

s if smog-infested Southern 
California does't have 
enough lung-disintegrating 
smoke to deal with in the 
first place, we now 

have the option to make 
our lives even more unhealthy. 

Proposition 188 is an attempt ~ deceive 
voters into supporting the "smoker-friendly" 
atmosphere of public places. It willingly scoffs 
at local community laws and threatens to inflict 
ashtray-induced health problems upon every-
day citizens. 

Under Proposition 188, our health would be 
comp~mised so that tobacco comJ*1ies such 
as Philip Morris, one of the main lobbyists for 
this bil~ can boost their sales on tobacco prod-
ucts and ensure a solid legal fOOling on any 
smoking-related controversy which may arise 
in the future. 

To understand tobacco companies' mo-
tives for pushing Proposition] 88, it is impor-
tant to recognize the political power they have 
had in the past. Traditionally, tobacco compa-
nies such as Philip Morris and RJ Reynold<; 
have strongly influenced state government in 
the United States, protecting their profits amid 
ever-changing smoking regulations. In the 
1991 -92 election cycle, for example, Califor-
nia 's lawmakers received $10,000 each from 
tobacco interests - they bought votes from 
our legal representatives. By holding key fig-
ures in lawmaking committees, tobacco com-
panies thought they had protected themselves 
against their political foes. But California's 
health craze threw tobacco companies into the 
spotlight. 

They were criticized, and smoking became 
a serious public-health issue. This new-found 
stigma against smoking made the tobacco 
industry increasingly uneasy and forced it to 
look for other options. They have turned to the 
initiative process as a last-ditch alternative. 
Although Proposition 188 is. not written to the 
complete advantage of tobacco giants, the 
measure lead<; them to a legal haven far from 
the reaches of California'S Evian-toting citi-
zens. 

The ad would implement a statewide regu-
lation of smoking in public places, and it calls 
for "statewide restrictions on the marketiJ18 afttl 
disttibution of tobacco products vending ma- • 
chines, and billboard advertising near schq>1 
grounds." With this proposition as carefully 
worded as it is, its antislTlOking approach is 
almost believable. 

Philip Morris misled California voters to 
believe they were petitioning for strong 
antismoking laws within the state. Petition 
circulators were specifICally told not to re-
veal that the initiative would wipe out and 
replace already established, and in most cases 
more restrictive, local smoking Jaws. Philip 
Morris has IICIOUnged fur Californian's trust 
Ihroup sweet-talking maileralllCl shiny false 
Idvcrtilcmc .... but we IDUIt not allow tbcIe 

TIle UCSD Guardia 

PINION 

sugarcoated enmu~ments to buy off our 
votes. 

Along with many other t10underins tobIao 
companies, Philip Morris has attempted to 
discredit the Environmental Protection 
Agency's finding which pinpoints 
secondhand smoke as a serious 
public health ooncem. 

Proposition 188 
sprayspolitica\ air fresh-
ener to cover up its 
stench. It would repeal 
local governments' 
smoking ordinances 
and replace them 
with statewide rul-
ings-rulings which 
would nicely con-
form to smokers' 
preferences. 

It claims that it 
would take responsibil-
ity for the public's health: 
Proposition 188 would al-
low smoking in restaurants, 
work places, offices, cafet~­
rias and conference rooms with-
outmandatingthattheseareashave 
separately ventilated smoking 
rooms. This would promote smoking 
and would thus be detrimental to public 
health. 

We must see Proposition 188 for what 
it is: A bill which claims it would help 
the public, bul in {e8lity would only 
serve the inte~ of tobacco compa-
nies. 

The measure deludes the public 
in its intenl and would undermine 
numerous tough antismoking poli-
cies. In addition, Proposition 188 
would burden taxpayers with in-
creasing health-care costs as a result 
of a greater number of smoking-re-
lated diseases. 

Misleading in nature, restrictive to local 
policies and detrimental topub\ic health, Pr0po-
sition 188 is an insult to the intelligence of 
Californian voters. On Nov. 8, we mllSl not 
allow ourselves to become the butt of the to-
bacco industry's joke.

AB fJ71; the proposition would take 
a two-tbirda vote to kiU. 

While "tine stribI" win remain

ticians to pay attention to "three

in general, Proposition 184 is particu-
lIrJy detrimenlll to minorities and the 
poor. The problem is dill the strikes 
Ire ,etJaectWe. Minoritiesand thepoor 
Ire economically and socially disad-
vantaged, and such I Jaw only puts 
them furthenmequalground. "Ibree-
strikes" law does not prevent people 
from stealing food if they are starving 
or &om proCectina lbemselves in life-
tIue*ni,. situIIions. 

In addition, I provision in Proposi-
tion 184l11ows for I "dismdon to 
dismiss a Itrike in the interest of jus-
tice." We do not need to present this 
tough Jaw to criminals if it can be 
arbitrarily overruled by our officials. 

This danprous loophole IIIows 
officials and judges to make I deci-
sion which would be completely un-
cbecbd by the law; therefore, racial 
or c .... disc:rimination IS weD IS fi-
nancial coen:ion could play heavily 
on "dismissals." 

The current law Ind Proposition 
.184 send a hard-hitting message to 

criminals, but it's not nccessarily the 
right one. Instead of scaring criminals 
into good behavior, it wiU only under-
mines their motivation to reform their 
Jjves. 

Groups such IS Parents of Mur-
dered Children, Women Prosecutors 
of California and the National Victim 
Center claim that the currenllaw and 
Proposition 184 targets serious and 
violent criminals. Yel this proposi-
tion is more concerned with turning 
justice into a game than human lives. 

On Nov. 8, California voters have 
theoppcxtunity to Jet legislators know 
that we don't want our mminll jus-
tic:esyslem to be turned into IDexpen-
sive, inefficient getting-tough-on-
criminals game. Thoup the list of 
Proposition 184's supporten is long 
and impressive, we shouldn't jump 
on the bandwagon. Supporters of this 
initiative like to compare' crime to a 
game which victims can win; how-
ever, if our rule book is biaed we will 
never be able to play fair.

Of 

Peace Corps volunteers find 
that their two years of service is often 
more about learning than teaching 
By TOOl Barkley, Staff Writer 

Sharon Kennedy stood nervously 
before the curious villagers of the small 
Thai town of Ban Dan Lan Hoi - Thai 
for "border town of the happy snails." 

Kennedy. who gndualed from UCSD 
only a few months earlier, was anxious 
to implement her plan to start a duck-
raising farm in the village. This was her 
first real test after arriving at her "site," 
and she wu nervous about winning the 
villagers' support for the project. 

While she spoke and answered ques-
tions about the farm, several Buddhist 
monks tinbred with machinery in the 
back of the crowd. 

The three months of intensive lan-
guage and cultural training provided by 

t~ Peace Corps helped her to pitch the 
idea, but when the village accepted her 
plan, no amount of training could have 
prepared her for what followed. 

A generator roared to life behind the 
villagers, and Kennedy looked on in 
horror as one of the monks handed her a 
microphone. 

" It was one of 
those 'Mr. Mike' 
things," she re-
called, "and they 
wanted me to sing 
this Thai song. If there's a guest of 
honor, they get to sing. I have a horrible 
singing voice - it was humiliating." 
_ ...... World of DI ....... II. 

In his 1961 Inaugural address, Presi-
dent Kennedy pledged to help the devel-
oping world in its struggle "to break the 
bonds of mass misery." He launched a 
Peace Corps tuk force the next day. 

In August of the same year, the first 
Peace Corps volunteers headed for 
Ghana. Thirty-three years and 140,000 
volunteers later, the Peace Corps oper-
atea in more than 90 countries IICIOSS the 
globe. 

Its purpose ill not jUlt to lend a help-
ing hand to the world, but to change the 
perceplione of volunteers and the people 
with whom they work. Since its incep-
tion, the Peace Corps hu streased three 
pis: help forelp countries in need of 
aid, promote I better undentanding of 
Americ:ans abroad and provide Amen-

cans a better understanding of the 
world. 

II is the first 1011 which often 
proves most diffICult. Many volun-
teers go to host countries with "the in-
tention of spending most of their timeon 
the first goal, which is training man-
power," KeMedy said. "But when you 
get there, with the language and the 
culture, there's a lot you have to go 
through before-you can actually (make 
an] effort." 

At the end of her two-year stint in 
Th.iland, Kennedy, who is now the 
Revelle College Assistant Resident 
Dean, found she had accomplished little 
during her stay. 

The frustration of not meeting one's 
expectations is tough, Kennedy said. "I 
spent the first six months [in Thailand] 
moping around. Then I realized I was 
only going to be able to do little projects 
and I eventually felt good about the little 
projects," . 

In addition to the partially successful 
duck farm, these 
' little projects' in-
cluded a training pro-
gram to teach women 
how to make and sell 

shampoo and. program to help women 
market their woven baskets. 

Kennedy is not the only one to have 
met with such difficulties. UCSD Pro· 
gr.ms Abroad Office Advisor Bill 
Clebby, who served in Senegal with his 
wife, Joan. from 1985-87, encountered 
a number of unforeseen problems. 

After spending four months getting 
to know the people and customs, the 
couple worted with the village to deter-
mine what project wu most needed in 
the sman community. After several im-
practic:al idea such U I helicopter port 
or • 1..,..1 airport were dismissed, the 
viII .. settled on improving its water 
supply. . 

BId the project stalled from the be-
giJlllina. -In eli ... weUa, wlaere to put 
them wu a big question," C1abby said, 
"They would uy, 'You decide whose 
land to put this on. , And I'd say, 'It's not 
my decieion,' becauIe the priorities have 

ON THE MOVE AROUND THE WORLD 
Over the last 32 years, 140,000 volunteers 
have served the Peace Corps in more than 100 
countries worldwide.

theirs 
and the 
organiza-
tion has to be 
theirs. It took 
six months just to 
decide where to put 
the wells." 

The .feeling of not 
achieving one's goals is 
common, according to Peace 
Corps Public Affai~ Manager 
Robin Clark. "You go in feeling 
inadequate-measuring success as 
the· wiled labGr you provide," she 
said. "When asked to quantify your 
accomplishments, it rarely comes out 
to much." . 

However, from herbroaderperspec-
tive as an administrator, she says that 
much work is being compleled and the 
results are tangible .. 

"The program has saved many lives 
with the Guinea Worm program in West 
Africa. In Ghana, the program has 
evolved so much that while they ini· 
tially required English teachers, now the 
local teachers are teaching English and 
they need Peace Corps volunteers to 
teach Enpish at the university level," 
Clark said. 

If the number of countries which 
request Peace Corps volunteers is any 
indication, the program is a tremendous 
SUClCCSII. Over 30 new nations have linked 
up with the Peace Corps since 1990, 
pushing the current total to 95.

CORPS: The 
cultural adjustment 
is most difficult 
ContInued .......... 
goals - cultural exchange - are . 
extremely suc:ceaful. 

Kennedy found that the friends 
she made were the most rewarding 
aspect of the program, ud she has 
sinc:e returned to visit Ban Dan Lan 
Hoi. Her time in the Peace Corps 
also changed her views on the world 
and the United States. 

"I gained a lot from them, and I 
think they gained a lot from me," 
she said" "I~ wu the first time they 
had ever seen an American or a 
white person." 

It may be the cultural exchange 
which explains why the Peace Corps 
continues to draw some of the best-
educated Americans into the "tough-
est job you'll ever love." 

"I would Sly that the second and 
third goals were better accom-
plished,'" Kentedy said. '" 

Clabby agreed. "The first goal, 
the service, is what your job de-
scription contains - it is the reason 
for the country to request you," he 
said. "But in my opinion, you can do 
just a little. It is the third goal you 
gain the most out of. I definitely 
learned more than I taught." 

Clark, who spent four years in 
Guinea as a Peace Corps volunteer 
before coming to work for the pro-
gram, said that "alltural transfor-
mation" is extremely important. 
.......... 

Three years after returning from 
Thailand, Kennedy admits that she 
sometimes paints an overly rosy pic-
ture of her PaCe Corps experience. 
Sickness, weight loss, homesick-
ness, aalture shock and loneliness 
aU contributed to the ups ud downs 
of the program, she said. 

"I had to start everything from 
scratch; it wu bard to get things 
going. hard to have self-esteem when 
you have no projects going. You're 
there to help people, but you haven't 
figured thinp out yet," Kennedy 
said. 

Surprisingly, the loss of normal 
day-to-day amenities such u elec-
tricity and running water was not 
the hardest aspect of the program to 
adjust to, ICCOrding to Clabby. "The 
hardest things were the cultural dif-
ferences," he said. 

Especially difficult for Clabby 
and bis wife were the different gen-
der roles. Rather than challenge the 
traditional division of labor, they 
lesrned to adjust to the cultural 
norms and work within them. 

"Instead of saying, 'You should 
throw off your shackles and tell the 
man where to go,' [women V'oIun-
teers) instead realized that a better 
way is to say, 'This is the job women 
do, and these are the opportunities 
they have. If women do vegetable 
gardening and men don't, make it a 
business for them to make money, " 
Cabby said. 
'Neo colonldlm 

Yet, the aaltural issues have ID-
other side to them. Critics have 
pointed to the paternalistic nature of 
the Peace Corps and its condescend-
ing attitude toward native popula-
tions. Do other aalturea need West-
ern concepcs to guide everything 
from agriculture to education tosani-
tation? 

The problem is weD illustrated 
by the pbotograpbs ineluded in the 
Peace Corps' public relatioas packet. 
In one, a white man stands over a 
black child at a ICbooI dealt is he 
works on his EngIiah skills. The 
message of suc:II images, critics say, 
points to the problem with the Peace 
Corps. 

But the aaltural isaues are not u 

Moaday. Oetober 31. 1994 

straight forward II some critic:i con-
tend. 

After living with his "adopted" 
father for a year, aabby asked him 
and other elders whether they were 
happy that the Freoc:b and Portu-
guese bad colonized their country. 
Their answer surprised him. 

"They told me, 'Of course we're 
glad they came. Look at what you 
see in our village now: aluminum 
pots to cook in, clothes to wear, 
lOme money in our pockets, nets to 
fish in, kcrosene in our lamps 10 our 
kids can study,'" he said. . 

Cabby added that if he had made 
sucb a comment before his trip 
people may have accused him of 
being an imperialist. "That idea-
that we shouldn't even go there - is 
a bit limited," he said. "It's not II 
simple as that." 

The Peace Corps three month 
training programs focus on values 
and norms of local populatioas. "If 
you realize the skills [that tbe local 
population bas], and they are many, 
you are less likcly to impocJ8ur 
own on them," Clabby said. 
.....c...·Clln ••• _ 

The Peace Corps has cbanpd in 
many ways over the lISt tine de-
cades. 

Tbe program bas expanded 
acrou the globe and now teac:bcs 
everything from agricultural tech-
niques in small African Vii .... to 
how to operate a small buainesa in 
post-Cold War Poland. la addition, 
more women and minorities partici-
pate, and the average age of volun-
teers bas climbed from 22 to 31. 

But for all the cba .... , one thing 
remai .. the same: Every year vol-
unteers move out to change the 
world, and when they como home 
27 months later, they find that the 
world has cbanged them.

The fifth-team spot belonged to 
veteran Jane Zimmerman, who 
streaked to a 21st-place overall, 
20:31 result. Courtney Grey (20:45) 
chalked up another speedy perfor-
manee for the J'ritons, racing to 24th 
place in a field of 37 athletes. 

UCSD's Liana Wright vaulted 
up to the final ~ring slot for the 
Tritons, speeding across the finish 
line in 28th place with a time of

Closing out the runners for 
UCSD was freshman Marikka Elia, 
who barely missed the seventh scor-

"[Elia) wu really sick. She had 
some heavy thoughts, but she went 
out and competed," Van Arsdale 
said. "She took a huge step and 
showed enormous fortitude. She 
beat out her nearest opponent by 
over 40 yards. " 

With a solid showing at CCAA 
under their belt, Van ArsdaJe reasons 
that the Tritons' "next door to walk

the NatioDaI Auocialioa of Intercol-

Water Polo Drops Two to LA. 
ByG .... Wrenn 
C",Spons Editor 

To.n outsider, the UCSD men's 
water polo team's constant battles ' 

. with the premier schools in the 
country m.y seem like an exercise 
in futility. But the Tritons need not 
offer an explanation; they could just 
show these non-believers this 
weekend's results. 

Sixth·ranked UCLA narrowly 
escaped Canyonview with an 11-9 
victory over the number 11 Tritons 
last night, while second·ranked 
USC was only four points beller 
than UCSD Saturday night, 11-7. 

The Bruins h.d to pl.y catch-up 
on Sunday. With 53 seconds gone 
in the first quarter, UCSD's James 
Swlen put the Tritons up 1-0 when 
he beat Bruin goalie Matt Swanson 
from close range. Some tricky de-
fense helped put UCSD up by two 
when Triton «reg SaIvinski Stole a 
Swanson outlet pass to teammate 
Steve Covce. SlIvinski dumped it 
to fellow Triton Steve Crus who 
was all alone in the center of the 
pool. CrISS swam it in and fired, 
giving the Tritons a 2-0 lead. 

UCLA scored two goals in a row, 
the second coming on a m.n-up situ· 

atio!\ ~ft~! Sualen was ejected. Jlut 
UCSD's Craig Gruber restored the 
Triton lead to two when he rifled in 
a two-point shot to put his team up 
4-2 with 2: 11 to play in the first. 

The Tritons increased the lead to 
thrcc 1 :49 into the second period. 
Triton goalkccper Joe Welsh found 
teammalc Teague Soderman with a 
long pass down the left side. 
Soderman did the rest and his goal 
gave the Tritons a 5-2 edge, but 
UCLA scored the last thrcc goals of 
the first half; the fin.1 one. Luther 
Weidner shot th.t tied the score at 
five with only four seconds to play 
before intermission. 

The third period was the Tritons' 
undoing. Salvinski scored first for 
the Tritons, but the Bruins re~ 
sponded with four straight. The fi-
nal two were. the most devastati,-, 
i,n the game and cam~ on a two-, 
point shot from Corbin Grah.m that 
gave UCLA a 9-6 lead with. only 
one second to play in the qu.rter. 

"The two pointer to end the third 
was critical," UCSD Head Coach 
Denny H.rper said. "I believe that 
we would've won the game if we 
had only been down by one to start 
the fourth. " 

The Tritons came back to tie tbe 
game in the final period. First it was 
Skulen's penalty shot with 4:48 to 
play that brought tbe Tritons to 
wit bin 9-7. Fifty-one seconds later, 
Soderman tied the game when his 
screamer of a shot beat Swanson to 
knot the score .t nine. 

However, just 21 seconds after 
tbat, Bruin Thomas Wong took ad-
v.ntage of a m.n-up situation to sink 
• two-pointer of his won, giving 
UCLA .11 the edge it would need. 

UCSD hid. final chance with 24 
seconds to pl.y but couldn't take ad-
v.ntage of • UCLA ejection and an 
errant pass sealed the Tritons' f.te. 

"This was a pretty outstanding 
effort," Harper said. "We were right 
there and went toe-to-toe with the 
sixth-ranked team in the ~untry. 

The UCLA game followed 10-
other tough effort against USC on 
Saturday. "People think that losing 
by four goals is I big foss," Harper 
Slid. "But USC m.y be good 
enough to beat Stanford. For us to 
come within four is Ii~e the Mesa 
College football team losing to 
Notre Dame by a touchdown." 

SlIvinski led tbe Tritons with 
three scores against the "Trojans. 

Tritons' Texas ~~ a Success 
VOWYBALL: UCSD falls to St. Mary's; rebounds for tournament win 
By DMKr8ft 
Co-SpoffS Editor 

It's not often th.t a UCSD ath· 
letic squ.d h~ the chance to do 
some intrastate traveling ud expe-
rience life on tbe road in prepara-
tion for the playoffs. So, when these 
opportunities arise, it behooves the 
team to make the most of them. 

AS. Lm. flight and a late arrival 
II the game cost the Triton women's 
volleyball team (24-6) a win in its 
first match of • three-day swing 
through Texas last week. However, 
UCSO, which currently holds a 
number-tbree rankilll in Division 
III, recovered in a weekend tour-
nament at Trhiity University, 

lW~ng through ill 
four matches to take 
the tide and regain the 
momentum it had 
been building for 
NCAA!. 

The Tritons' only 
"/oas" of the tourna-
ment came in the 
opening minutes of a 
Saturday-night show-
down witb tbe bost 
Tigers of Trinity, 
when middle blocker 
Chriltine Chi weat 
down with a badly in-
jured 1JlIde.

Chi had been spearbeadiaa the Tri-
tona' charge tbrough tbe touma-
meat. She had been one of the Tri-
tons' kill leaden in each game and 
was also pacilll the tournament in 
blocks. 

UCSO was able to recover from 
this setback because of its strength 
in the middle to earn a four-set vic-
tory over Trinity (1S-10, 15-7, lO-
IS, 15-9). 

"Trinity bad a big, spirited 
crowd," Head Coacb Doug Danne-
vilt said. -But we overcame that and 
the injury to [Chi] and beat the num-
ber-six team in the nation. It wu a 
great win." 

Senior blockers Kristi Allteland

What Does 
Smack Mean? Cross Country Combo Crushes CCAAS 

I was lying at home one 
afternoon listening to the radio 

, and wondering what in the 
world of sports was deserving 
of some good 01', down-home 
whining. 

you see, Jim Rome - of 
XTRA Sports 690 fame -
does it all the time. He whines 
about everything from the 
Padres new manager to race 
relations in the Raiders' front 
office. While listening to him 
spout off, I came to a startling 
realization: Only one sport is 
playing games that count right 
now. Hell, half of the major 
sports leagues have come to a 
halt, leaving us with the NBA 
preseason and the NFL. 

Personally, I don't have a 
problem with this drought. I'm 
from the school of thought 
which believes, "football is life 
and nothing else matters." 

Now, for all you duffers -
that 's a fancy way of saying 
golf geeks - don't think that 
I'm leaving golf out for no 
reason. I discounted golf from 
the first moment I saw it on the 
grounds that it stinks and I 
hate it. Obviously this is not 
the most scientific of explana-
tions, but I stand by my 
opinion. (Unless of course you 
call me on it.) 

Nowadays, receivers going 
deep is about the only big 
sports play one can look 
forward to on the evening 
news. (Unless, of course you 
get enthused at the site of 
negotiators hiding behind mics 
and wires, calling each other 
names.) I say, who needs the 

' - pucksters and the sultans of 
swing when you can watch fat 
guys yelling, a spectacle every 
bit as awe-inspiring? And think

BALBOA: Castner-Smith duo vaults Tritons into 
third place in bolh men's and women's divisions 
ByTeddUdd 
Associate Sports Editor 

Through the eyes of a good cross 
country runner, it 's a black and 
white world. It's because there's that 

moment in 
every race 
when the 
runner de-
cides to ei-
ther ratio-
nalize or to 
run faster. 

It's a 
s imp I e 
choice for a 
good runner 
- either 
compete or 
don't com-

pete. The UCSD tracksters did 
plenty of the former last weekend 
when they hosted the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
(CCAA) Conference Champion-
ships at Balboa Park. 

"Eacb meet is a stepping stone 
towards nationals," said Triton Head 
Coach Ted Van Arsdale. "This meet 
was a great opportunity to compete 
against bigh-Ievel talent." 

Despite the dismal morning 
cloud cover, UCSD refused to be 
overshadowed during Saturday's 
festivities. The Tritons captured a 
sweep of third place as the men's 
and women's squads garnered 56 
and 84 points, respectively. 

"It was a mixed bucket," Van 
Arsdale said. "We got some great 
performances, but we still have 
some goals to accomplish." 

In a performance nothing short 
of spectacular, UCSD's J.J. Castner 
set the standard for the Triton men's 
squad. Noticing his team's need for 
more points, Castner rushed far 
ahead of the pack to place higher. 

And if it wasn't for pesky River-
side runner Lihn Lee's first-place 
26:29 time, Castner would have 
been crowned overall champion. As 

it WIS, he sprinted to a 
remarkable second 
place mark of 25:37. 

"[Castner] had to 
watch up at the front 
for what was going on. 
Everyone was keying 
in on him," Van 
Arsdale said. "He did 
what he needed to do. 
He pushed ahead be-
cause he wasn't afraid 
to take the chance." 

In a 2-3 scoring 
punch for UCSD, Rob-
ert Ho and John Walsh 
galloped into the llth-
and 12th-place slots, 
with timesof26:31 and 
26:33. 

nm CIIen/GuMtI .. 

Triton teammate 
Walter Dehority wasn't 
too far behind, clock-
ing a 26:43 time to go 
along with a 14th-place 
overall finish. Kyndni SmIth led the Triton women'llqUId.

"It takes chemistry to run in pack 
effectively," Van Arsdale said. "The 
women are stilllea~ng techniques. 
The men are still learning when to 
use the techniques they already 
know." 

UCSD's Neal Harder jaunted to 
'a solid 26:49 mark over the hilly 
eight-kilometer course, garnering 
17th-place overall and fifth-place 
team honors. 

"[Harder] was my choice forTri-
ton atblete-of-t~eTweek," Van 
Arsdale said. "He dropped his pre-
vious time by over half of a mindte 
on this course." 

Gavin Klinger and Nathan 
Jobnson, slipped into the final two 
scoring spots for tbe Tritons with 

nifty 26:56 and 26:59 times, respec-
tively. UCSD's Texas-based young-
ster Michael Burns dashed to a re-
spectable 24th-place mark of 27:02. 

Tritons Greg Field (28:03) and 
Goss Lindsay (28:19) rounded out 
the field for UCSD with 33rd- and 
34th-place fioshes, creating a mini-
mal time gap of only 1:22 between 
runners o~ through seven. 

"We've got a real interesting 
myriad of older and younger run-
ners," Van Arsdale said. "To take 
tbird [place] is very impressive." 

The UCSD women did some 
impressing of their own with a low 
1-7 gap of 1:34, in addition to sev-
eral weigbty individual perfor-
