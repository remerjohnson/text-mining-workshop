Women in Law, a student 
orgamzation at USD,is hosting 
this year's confere nce, which 
conference organizers expect to 
draw approXimately 500 
participants from nme western 
states. 

Midge Costanza, former 
advisor to President Jimmy 
Carter, will give this year's 
keynote address. Costanza is a 
noted human rights activist. 

USD's Student Bar Association 
has joined Women in law in 
hosting a Friday evening 
presentation featuring author and 
political activist Kate Millett. 
Millett will speak on the 

• involuntaty commitment of 
women to mental institution. Her 
speech and the subsequent 
reception featuring jazz Singer 
Ella Ruth Piggee are open to the 
public. Tickets will be available' 
through USD Women m Law for 
$5.00. 

Feminist attOrney Gloria 
Allred , California assembly 
woman Lucy Killea , activist 
Margo St. James and Judy 
Rowland, author of The Ultimate 
Violation , are among the 120 
speakers selected for this year's 
conference. 

Forty-three workshops are 
scheduled for the conference. 
Top ics include Women in the 
Welfare System; The Crime 
Victims Movement; Legislative 
Advocacy; Career Alternatives for 
the juris DoctOrate; Problems 
Confronting Women in the

Cluster open more 
hours 

Cluster Undergraduate Library 
is now open Monday through 
Thursday, 8am-2am; Friday 
8am-lOpm; Saturday 9am-
lOpm; and Sunday lOam -
2am. 

Last year, Cluster remained 
open until midnight on 
weekdays regularly. Hours were 
extended during finals weeks 
only. 

Chris Ferguson, head of the 
undergraduate libraty, said the 
AS worked with the 
administration to initiate the 
new libraty schedule, Harold 
Ticho, Vice-Chancellor of 
Academic Affairs, directed the 
funding necessary to exte nd the 
hOUTS, Ferguson said. 

Ferguson is concerned for the 
safety of students using the 
library until late. He has 
contacted the UCSD Police about 
extending hours for the 
Community Service Officer 
(CSO) escolt service. 

Ferguson added that 
comments from the suggestion 
box at Cluster have been 
generally against the new hours. 
"Some students suggested that we 
Stop the extended hours and use 
money that we saved to purchase 
new books. But it's not that 
easy," he said. Ferguson feels 
that after the first set of finals at 
the end of fall quarter, students 
will become more receptive to 
the new schedule. 

Ferguson said the new hours 
would be in effect this year on a 
trial basis. 

The gate coum of users of the 
Cluster Library was 842,000 last 

yea r, a number 100,000 greater 
that the count for Central Libraty 
over the same period. Ferguson 
attributes the high number to 
students using Cluster for "social 
and study" purposes, rather than 
for reference. 

Lecture on death 
defying cells 

"Interference in the Aging 
Process in a Single Cell" will be 
the topic of TWO free public 
lectures sponsored by UCSD's 
Institute for Research on Aging 
on Wednesday, October 30. 

Dr. Joan Smith-Sonneborn , 
professor of zoology and 
physiology at the University of 
Wyoming, will speak. 

Smith-Sonneborn 's research 
centers on how the life span of 
cells is determined . In higher 
organisms, including humans, 

. the life-span of essential cell s 
may influence the life-span of 
the entire organism, she believes, 

"If we could control cell life-
span , then we might be able to 
manipulate the life-span of any 
organism," she said. "This might 
lead eventually to sholtening the 
life-span of disease-causing 
organisms, or lengthening the 
life-span of cells that make up 
the natural defense mechanisms 
of the human body." 

Smith-Sonneborn will discuss 
findings from her work with 
microscopic one-celled animals 
that can live indefinitely, 
apparently without showing signs 
of reduced growth , loss of vitality 
or reduced cell division rate as 
they age. 

"The fact that certain cells can 
escape death implies to me that 
cell aging is not a natural law 
and that the process of aging 
could be altered," she said , 

Smith-Sonneborn will also 
discuss her tesearch on , 
experimental methods of 
increasing the life-span of cells. 

The first lecture will be given 
at 2:30pm in Lieb Auditorium, 
505 Coast Boulevard South in La 
Jolla. 

The evening lecture will be 
held at 8pm in th Leonard 
Garren Auditorium in the School 
of Medicine 's Basic Science 
Building.

Regents approve 
long ternl fee hike 
By BARBARA SOBEL 

A LONG-TERM FEE policy which will aUow for an increase in education and 
registration fees , TWO major 
research grants for UCSD and a 
special maintenance fund for 
UCSD housing were among the 
action items approved at the 
Regents' monthly Board meeting 
last week in San Francisco. 

Sparked by the state legislature 
directed study of the sharp 
increases of 80 perCem in 
student fees beTWeen 1980 and 
1984, the Regents have accepted 
a proposal for a long-tt:rm 
student fee policy. The new 
policy will commence fall 1986. 
The proposal stemmed directly 
from a state Senate Bill (SB 195) 
signed by the governor in 
February, 1985, which 
recommended long-term fee 
policies for both the Univesity of 
California and California State 
University systems. 

The new policy is considered 
by the Regents to be a 
commitment to keeping fees as 
low \lS possible through a 
gradual, moderate and 
predictable set of changes each 
academic year. The policy stateS 
that fees may change, increase or 
decrease , but no more than 10 
percent from each prior year's 
fee level. 

The Committee on Finance 
believes that this new policy will 
benefit STUdents, the university 
and the State. STUdents and their 
families will be able to plan 
better finanCially with predictable 
fee adjustments for thier 
educaiton costs. Written into the 
new policy is a .provision stating 
that as fees rise , the sqlle will 
provide additional financial aid 
to offset increases for students 
who show need. The Stability of 
me new policy will provide the 
university with a definite range 
of income figures for budgeting 
and planning. The state benefits 
from the long term fee policy will 
include the elimination of annual 
debates concerning fee levels 
and the use of fee revenues. 

The new long-term policy 
contains a provision for 
"unforeseen circumstances." If 
enacted this ,clause would affect 
fees for one year only. The 
subsequent year's fee level would 
return to the initially determined 
level if the provision was 
enacted . 

Contingent upon the approval 
of the long-term fee policy were 
TWO fee increases. Effective fall, 
1986, the Regents have passed 
an increase in educational and 
registration fees of 7.5 percent. 

Educational fees provide 
support for centrally 
administered student service 
programs and financial aid . The 
new policy will equalize graduate 
and undergraduate fee levels, 
and then increase all full-time 
student education fees by $56 for 
the 1986-87 academic year. 
Currently full-time graduate 
students pay $782 per year and 
full time undergraduate students 
pay $722 per year in education 
fees. As of the 1986-87 
academic year, all full-time 
students will pay $793 per year. 

Registration fees provide fund s 
for services which are necessary 
for STUdents, but are not part of 
university programs in 
instruction, research, or public 
service, such as academic 
advising, counseling and 
recreational activities. 

Each university chancellor is 
authorized to allocate registration 
fees on his respective campus. 
The new policy will put a ceiling 
on fUTUre registration fees. 
Effective fall, 1986, registration 
fees shaD not exceed 5563 per 
year pet full-time student. This is 
a 7.5 percent increase over the 
current average registration fee of 
$523. 

The UCSD Center for Living 
Tissues under the direction of 
Yaun-Cheng Fung of the AMES 
Department was awarded a 
research grant of approximatly 
$15.4 million The money wiD be 
allocated over a five-year period 
to begin May 1, 1986. If 
approved by the National 
Science Foundation, UCSD will 
propose the center as a 
university organized research 
unit. 

The objective of the project is 
to understand human living 
tissue propelties and growth 
patterns. The focus of four 
engineering and four basic 
science units will be on tissue 
substiTUtes, specifically, articular 
caltilage, skin and blood vessels 
blood. The approach lor 
cartilage, skin and blood vessels 
is directed toward biodegradable 
polymers into which patients'

Student Body President's Council: Voice of Students 

Greg Arnold, AS \lice-president of external affairs .. . 

By DIANE RIGDON 

T HE STUDENT BODY President's Counci l (SBPC) serves as the voice of 
University of California students. 
The SBPC's function is 10 
represem students to the UC 
Board of Regents and to UC 
President David Gardner and to 
his University Dean of Students, 
A.D. Brugger. 

The SBPC is also the 
supervising body of a 
professional lobby staff of four in 
Sacramento which intensely 
lobbies state legislators on the 
behalf of students; it's ranked 
13th among California's other 
lobbies as most powerful, behind 
conglomerates and the University 
of California's own lobby, 
according to UCSD SBPC 
representative Greg Arnold . The 
SBPC has officers (TWO from each 
campus, one an undergraduate 
student and the other graduate 
who represent the student body 
in the SBPe. They report roughly 
10 times per year, taking poll 
results into consideration . 

UCSD's representatives are 
undergraduate Greg Arnold and 
graduate student Corky Koen. 
Arnold, AS vice-preSident of 
external affairs, is serving on the 
SBPC, this time as administrative 
vice-preSident. 

, Each SBPC member must be 
highly ~nowledgeable in one of 
the SBPC's areas of concern , 
Arnold said . He focused his 
attention on finan cial aid. last 
year and will concentrate on 
student fees this year. 

SBPC's preSident, Dan 
Greening, a UCLA computer 
scie nce major, is the one who 
makes the formal speeches 
before the Regents. He also 
presides over the lengthy council 
meetings , held at a different UC 
campus each time. 

SBPC has three main 
committees: Academic Affairs, 
Student Fees and Services, and 
Social Responsibility. Each 
committee carefully studies 
Sacramento legislatio~ peltaining 

to the UC system and vice-
preSidents of each commmee 
report to a student lobby 
dIrector for advice , Arnold said . 

The council has exclusive right 
10 appear before the Regents 
with its concerns and it has no 
timidity in expressing them , he 
said. 

Greening said in his report on 
the 1986-87 budget to the 
Regents, "While we still may put 
in our TWO cents at the Capitol, 
as always, we 'd rather work with 
you (the Regents) than against 
you. It's a heck of a lot more 
fun .. . " 

One person with whom 
Greening a nd the council work 
closely is university dean of 
studems, A.D. Brugger. The 
SBPC's senior officials meet with 
him every month. Brugger, whose 
office is in Berkeley, said about 
the SBPC, "It gives very sound . 
advice on the large number of 
issues affecting the University of 
California , and its close ties to 
campus Associated Students 
accentuates its accessibility. Nine 
times out of 10 we agree. We do 
not view this as an adversarial 
arangement, but rather as a 
rational airing of viewpOints." 

The University of California'S 
generosity to the SBPC extended 
to providing some members, 
including Arn'old , with Ian 
exclusive tour of the Lawrence 
Livermore Laboratory recently. 
The SBPC has always offiCially 
opposed the university'S 

Arnold is an 
economics/ political sCIence 
major who plans 10 do graduate 
work in international reiallons 
and business, while Koen, a first· 
time rep., is a Medical School 
student.

The major Issues the council 
has dealt with this year have 
been affirmative action, financial 
aid, student fees and toxic 
chemicals, Arnold said . 

One goal of the council is to 
Increase toxic chemical 
awareness in UC laboratorIes. 
Many students who work as lab 

technicians or with research 
projects are working with 
potentiaUy hazardous chemicals, 
Arnold saId . The university 
doesn't currently provide lab

Cockburn wages battle 
against American media 
By MIKEL TOOMBS 

ALEXANDER COCKBURN , the combatitive journalist currently columnized 
in The Nation, waged battle 
against the American media's 
role in furthering the "new Cold 
War," last Thursday. 

In a Communications 
Department-sponsored lecture at 
Peterson Hall, Cockburn detailed 
what he sees as an ongoing 
righTWard drift jn the press that 
dates back to the afterm.;lth of 
Watergate. 

Linking the press ownership 
together with the Nixon 
Admimstratlon as members of 
the ruling "elite ," Cockburn 
explanined that the press was 
able to probe deeply into the 
Watergate scandal because "the 
elites were in conflict." However, 
he continued, since that time the 
press has sought to appease the 
administration , initially under 
the gujse of "putting the agony of 
Watergate behind us." 

Cockburn , an Irish -born 
commentator known for his pro-
Soviet and pro-Arab leanings, 
expressed his position with the 
same thoroughness and lack of 
compromise that has 
characterized his columns in The 
Nation and , earlier, The Village 
Voice. (His VOice column, which 
ran increasingly agamst the grain 
of that strongly Jewish-VOiced 
publication ,was discontinued 
after it was discovered Cockburn 
had accepted $10,000 from an 
Arab foundation.) 

In particular, he offered the 

"white is black" analogy. "The 
President comes out and 
announces that 'white is black: 
and at first the press is reserved . 
The President announced today 
that white is black, but it is 
generally held that white is not 
in fact black.''' As the President 
persists in this notion, Cockburn 
went on , the press decides that 
"white is a lot like gray, and gray 
is a lot like black, therefore 
maybe white and black aren't all 
that different." Finally, in 
Cockburn's scenario, the press 
declares that maybe white is 
black after all. 

Along with that general 
analogy, which he related to 
President Reagan's "Star Wars" 
pronouncements, Cockburn 
offered specific examples of what 
he perceives to be the media's 
tolerance, even embracement, of 
doubtful , right-wing theones. He 
Singled out the Wall Street 
foumal's "yellow rain" campaign 
where America's largest dally 
newspaper tried to convince the 
pubhc - with Initially positive 
results - that the Soviet Union 
was waging chemical warfare in 
Laos, when in fact bees were the 
culprit. 

Cockburn also cited the theor, 
that the attempted assassination ' 
of the Pope was devised by the 
Bulgarian secret sevice - and 
hen('\! the KGB - and the fa t 
that the promulgators of this 
theory were hIred by key 
members of both the print and 
televiSIOn media as "advisers ." ~

The art of jingoistic diplomacy 
in Tunisia. As if we had not had our ears stu fTed With enough Jingois tic cotton these past few 

years, the Reagan Administration (very redundant title, is it not? Perhaps next time we 
will introduce the term, "Rumpeistiltskin Committee") is now attempting to shape 
national consensus around the idea of reactionism, American political society, which , 
once in time, ...... as eager to· define JUSt where the epicenter of intemanonal catastrophe 
lies. seems to be sitting smug and satisfied with the recent turn of events on and above 
the Mediterranean ea. ' 

The capture , by four u.s. avy F-14 Tomcatjetfighters. of the four Palestinians who 
had hijacked an Italian Imer, the Achille Lauro, and who , during their siege of the ship , 
had killed an American citizen, Leon KlinghofTer, has spun-off a new round of military 
swashbuckling. U. Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger was so excited by the 

Egypt, a potential leader of the moderate Arab states, had hoped to convince the rest 
of the Arab community that recognition of Israel as a legitimate sovereign state was in 
the best interest of the entire region . Egypt's participation in the Middle East peace 
process appears to be a temporarily hopeless sitution, as the government of the Hosni 
Mubarak will be hard-pressed at this point' in time to convince its own pebple that 
Israel . perceived as the military right arm of the United States, is to be trusted in 
"peaceful" negotiations, The rest of the players, Jordan , Syria and the United States, are , 
may we inject, left holding the crumbling pie. 

avy's succssfultnterception of the EgyprAir 737 jetliner that was presumably 
transporting the hijackers to Tunsia either to be tried or given asylum (no one now will 
ever know the answer to that one) that he livened the episode 10 "the time of the 
Barbary pira tes." 

We must wonder, though, who wrote the original reci pe. According to the State 
Department, the number of terroristic incidents in the Middle East has doubled 
annually si nce 1982. Secre tary of State George Schultz has foregone advice that speaks 
10 the roots of terrorism as the last answer by a distraujl;ht and oppressed jl;roup to the 
militant actions of an oppressor. His absurdly shortsighted contribution to the 
formation of a workable U.S. foreign policy is encapsuled as such: "You have to get the 
message 10 terrOrIsts that the civilized community is opposed 10 what they are doing 
and prepared 10 take ac tion to see that they don't succeed, and that they are brought 
to justice , so there is a cost." It is ironic how if you applied that description to the 
practicioners of state terrorism - like the United States, with their henchmen in the 
CIA (say in Iran , Guatemala, Chile, Viemam, Korea , Nicaragua, El Salvador, and so on) 
- and Israel , most recently under the direction of the Likud Government in Lebanon, 
that one would not be so confused as to why these "terrorists" are striking oUI against 
representatives of the Western world. 

Very few people around Washington seemed concerned about the events that 
followed the capture , however; for instance, the Italian 'Government, led by Bettino 
Craxi. has virrually collapsed 10 the past week in direct correlation with tate 
Department condemnations of Craxi's decision not to detai n Palestiman Liberation 
Front leader Abul Abbas. Abbas had been aboard the Egyptian airliner serving as 
dIplomat-facilitator between the Egyptian government and the hijackers when the 
plane was forced down in SIcily. 

What is being IO ned down by WashinglOn is one-swift-step destruction of carefully 
constructed United States-Egypt agreements and mutual pledges of coopera tion that 
have been worked on for years. Since the day of the interception of the Egyptian 
airliner, the streets of Cairo have been in ruckus - students, workers and 
businessmen, led by an intense desire to unveil some semblance of an international 
code of honor, have taken to burning American nags - hardly a show of friendship . 

These Palestinians who hijacked the Achille Lauro wanted the Israeli government to 
know that bombing someone's headquarters, and in effect the only representation they 
have of a "homeland ," is simply not understandable. and that there is a "cost" involved. 

That our alli es governments and citizens have been caused great distress by the 
military's nick of the tricep, has not really phased WashingtOn, at least not yet. The 
Middle East peace process, which Egypt is an intricate part of. can now be basically 
shut in a vault for future reference, for three of the six major players have vanquished 
what little trust they had for one another in the last month. 

The intent here is not to justify the murder of an American citizen, nor to defend 
what many call "senseless violence ," for that act and phenomenon must be swept away. 
The solution however, is not a military one. The only recourse we have, if you are truly 
outraged when the innocent are gored by the lions' claws, is to abruptly change our 
policy of world repression and our support of brutal regimes who are oppressors of the 
so-called "terrorists ," merely because they best serve "American interests." Our populace 
seems to like things that are very black and white, for example mat America's might is 
a1wa.)II' ('ighl, and Ihat terrorists have no faces and no dead family members, own 
comfortable homes and get to watch TV anchorpeople blast away at vicious foreigners 
who have invaded their nation's privacy. Hell , the history of intemational conllict has 
never made good prime-time viewing anyway, and reactionism appeals most sweetly 10 
our non-thinking, debased instincts. 

Israel, with its bombing of a PLO headquarters in Tunisia a few weeks ago, broke 
every international code of sovereignty known to diplomats. Earlier this month the 
Palestinian Liberation Organization'S fragile leader, Yassir Arafat, had almost secured a 
bargain10g position for a Palestinian homeland with the U.S., Jordan and certain 
factions within the Israeli government, until his denial of any knowledge of the 
hijacking was cast astray when the hijackers appeared to be headed for his home-base -~C 

When the curtain fell-silence 
By DAVE RICHARD, Staff Wnter 

T HERE IS A lot of talk these days about South Africa , as well there 
should be. It seems that there is 
a protest evety time one turns 
around - a symbolic smke, 
mid-day rally. WhIle the overall 
impact of thIS student movement 
is questionable at best, what It 
stands for cannot be looked 
down upon. The movement for 
UC to divest gains its 
importance in symbolic language, 

as the first step toward 
impressing upon South Africa the 
Immortahty of their current racial 
polICIes. 

I would lIke to contend , 
however, that those who protest 
must begin to find some 
priorities regardi ng what they are 
protesting. Let us begin by 
accepting this proposition: South 
Africa's apartheid is morally 
wrong. I doubt many people 
would disagree with that 

statement. Apartheid IS 
fundamenta lly contral)' to our 
notions of democratic equality; 
indeed, it is hypocrisy 
institutionalized. But let us take 
the next step by accepting a 
second proposition: Apartheid is 
morally wrong because it denies 
selected individuals basic human 
rights. Would anyone disagree 
with this statement? Only the 
most misinformed person would 
argue that blacks are accorded 

the same rights as whites in 
South Africa. 

But now we are at a dilemma. 
What makes South Africa 
special? What makes it worth 
Singling out from the scores of 
countries violating human rights 
every day? If we protest South 
Africa on grounds of human 
rights, then are we not obligated 
to protest other violators such as 
the Soviet Union , VirtUally all of 
Eastern Europe (including 

Yugoslavia), Kampuchea, Iran, 
Iraq. Guatemala, Chile and so 
forth? Indeed, the violations we 
see in the Soviet Union would 
make South Afrtca pale by 
comparison. The presence of the 
Soviet police state in every 
aspect of Soviet society is so 
overwhelming and so organized 
that the peaceful, and even , 
raucous, organizing of opposition 
forces is unheard of. In South

We believe that those of your 
readership who have not read 
laSt week's issue of the California 
Review might be interested in 
this: 
An open leter to the editors of the 
California Review 

We, the undersigned Political 
Science graduate students, would 
like to congratulate you on rising 
to ·the level of your predecessors, 
Joe McCarthy and Torquemada, 
in your assertion that one of our 
most moderate faculty members, 
Wayne Cornelius, is a Soviet 
sympathizer. No doubt it was 
motivated by his participation in 
a study that demonstrated, 
contrary to your mythology, that 
the last Nicaraguan elections 
were indeed free (save 
manipulation by your idols in 
the Reagan, or should we say 
Regan, administration). We know 
how hard it must be for you to 
justify your support of cronies of 

one of the most brutal 
dictatorships in Latin American 
history against a democratically 
elected .governme nt - all in the 
name 'of Americanism. 

We hope you will continue to 
assail all anti-American 
influences you find infiltrating 
our society. We suggest that your 
next targets might be the 
Declaration of Independence, the 
Bill of Rights (following in Ed 
Meese's footsteps) , that godless 
heathen Thomas Jefferson , and 
of course the radical 
revolutionaries who fought 
against the Tory freedom 
fighters. We are confident that 
you can find as good evidence 
for these noble causes as you 
have for your pre5Cnt ones. 

We, too, were surprised that 
you found only six copies of 
your newspaper in our trash can. 
That pUts your readership in our 
department almost up 10 the 
level of the Pmnysaver and the 
Los Angeles Times AdvertiSing 

Supplement . Perhaps you will now 
gear your intellectual 
sophistication up 10 the level of 
those journals. 

We hope your feelings weren't 
hurt and that you will continue 
to deliver your paper to us. We 
promise we won't throw them in 
the department trash can. 
Frankly, we need the laugh, and 
there aren't enough George Will 
columns and Ronald Reagan 
press conferences to keep us 
satisfi·ed. Except for the Frank 
Bums issue , your paper has kept 
us in stitches for hours. 

We believe in the neceSSity of 
a gOO<l, mteUigent conservative 
journal on this campus, but until 
one appears yours will have to 
suffice. Keep up the good work 
and maybe when you improve, 
you can all land jobs as script 
writers for Hull! Hogan 's Rock n' 
Wrestling.

Absurd interpretation 

Editor: 
Regarding David Evans letter of 
October 17: 

You offer twO choices in 
interpreting the slogan "Arbeit 
Macht Frei "; the absurdity of 
these choices is astounding. You 
assen that either one must see 
that if he/ she interprets the use 
of "Arbeit macht frei" as a tribute 
to the Nazi "War Machine" then 
he/she must also see that the 
labor of the Nazi death camp 
prisoners resulted in some useful 
product, or one must interpret 
the placing by the Nazis of , 
• Arbeit macht frei" above their 
concentration camps as a self-
mocking, satirical statement 
designed to point oUI the 
madness of their society which 
encouraged it. Yau cannot 

display a slogan such as the one 
you do and then later create the 
parameters within which it must 
be interpreted - i.e., if it is 
interpreted in a negative sense , 
then the interpreter must be 
condoning that to which it is 
historkany linked. 

I cannot see the similarity 
between being interned in camps 
of tonure and death designed to 
annihilate a race, and the fact 
that modem society is working 
its way to its own destruction. 
You see, David , we have a choke 
as to whether or not we will 
bring about our own destruction. 
We are not being destroyed by a 
force we have no way to stop. 
We have minds and hearts and 
the power (whether we use it or 
not) to know right from wrong as 
regards humanity in general. If 
you are sincere in implying that 
you carry that Nazi slogan on 
your book bag in order to point

OPINIONS 

Filling the courts with uncivilities 
By PElER QUERelA 

America's unique system of 
jurisprudence stands out as the 
finest in the world. For over 200 
years this country's judicial 
system thrived as it embraced 
the very beSt democratic 
principles, to the end that every 
man and woman, rich or poor, 
white or black, Jew or gentile is 
theoretically equal under the law. 
In the United States, unlike 
virtuaUy any other country, a 
defendant is assumed innocent 
until a panel of his or her peers 
weighs the evidence and decides 
otherwise. 

Today, however, America's 
judicial structure is facing the 
greatest challenge in its history. 
A dilemma never envisioned by 
our nation's founding fathers is 
slowly but surely transforming 
our courts from places where 
punishment is tempered with 
mercy into something more akin 
to those of Europe's Dark Ages, 
when kings,barons, lords and 
bishops routinely meted out 
judicial decisions to promulgate 
their own selftsh interests or the 
wishes of those who placed them 
in pOSitions of authority. 

At this moment, the Reagan 
Administration, unable to coerce 
the liberal-dominated House of 
Representatives into 
implementing the most radical 
aspects of the second Reagan 
Revolution, is succeeding in 
reshaping the couns to funtion 
as the enforcement arm in 
establishing its political agenda. 

The incredible depths to 
which the Reaganites have sunk 
in an attempt to force their 
policies on the American People 
is unprecedented in US history. 
Taxpayeres are unknowingly 
footing the salary of. henchmen 
like Grover Rees Ill, a JuStice 
Department Interrogator, whose 
job description requires that he 
administer ideological litmus 
tests to Reagan-nominated 
federal judges. Rees incidently 
was handpicked by Attorney 
General Edwin Meese , the man 
whose legal entanglements 
should have made him ineligible 
for the position of washroom 
attendant. Meese , however, is the 
man most remembered for saying 
that all those men, women and 
children who wait in line at soup 
kitchens do so "because the food 
is free and that's easier than 
paying for it." 

In behind-door meetings , 

potential appointees are made to 
submit to a series of questions as 
to how they would rule on such 
sensitive topics as abortion, gun 
control (you're supposed to 
oppose it), school prayer, 
affirmative action and civil 
rights. A thorough examination is 
made of the nominees past 
record of ruling on these specific 
issues of importance to 
archconservatives. If the man 
answers wrong - and it was 
subsequently men who were 
chosen for judgeship in 202 out 
of 215 cases - then his is 

quickly dumped. If the man 
responds appropriately, his name 
goes to the Republican-controlled 
Senate for confirmation. Here 
Reagan's appointee is rubber-
stamped through. The purpose of 
these compre hensive litmus tests , 
of course, is to pack the judiciary 
with Reagan clones. All vestiges 
of fairness that Americans 
thought were inherent in our 
system of justice are being wrung 
out by judges beholden to the 
man they owe their jobs to. 

Qualifications have taken a 
back seat to ideological 
viewpoints in considering the 
"best" man. Of a total of 2)1

Africa we see the violence, the 
brutal reaction by the South 
African police and military. In 
the Soviet Union? Nothing, we 
rarely see the protest. That is 
because people live in fear, they 
know that any organized 
opposition would be dismantled 
before it even had a chance to 
form. 

So, we concentrate on South 
Africa, because there we can see 
the repression. This is not to 
make IiJdlt of the injustice in 
South A1rica (as I sense some 
might think.)lt is time for 
chanae. But realize as weB the 
predicament of so many 
individuals caught behind what 
has rightly been called the "iron 
cunain." 

Do not believe that they are 

satisfied with their lives simply 
because they do not protest. In 
totalitarian ~stems, the prolest is 
seen as a threat by the 
government. The Soviets have 
institutionalized and organized 
their control (through the KGB 
and GRU) so effectively that the 
bud is clipped before the flower 
can bloom. It is the advantage of 
absolute control; there is no 
"loyal" or "disloyal" opposition 
simply because there is no 
opposition. 

I had the opporrunity two 
years ago to tra~l to the Soviet 
Union and stUdy there for two 
months. In that time I met and 
became good friends widt a man 
in Leningrad. He was an 
Armenian named Anashes. We 
met initially in Dom Knigi (or 
Book Store) on a warm May day. 

persons nominated for federal 
judgeships by Reagan, only 13 
were women.Minority 
appointments amounted to only 
14 Hispanics and JUSt one black. 
In comparison, more that 20 
percent of Jimmy Caner's 265 
nominees were from the latter 
twO groups. The overwhelming 
majority of the Reagan judges 
have net worths in excess of 
5400,000; they're members of the 
highest 1 percent net-worth of aU 
Americans. By the end of his 
second tenn, Reagan will have 
filled over half the 761-member 

activists, labor unions, non-white 
males, petty lawbreakers, the 
media and basically anyone 
displaying liberal credentials on 
the specific issues the White 
House staff deems important.

Secretary Margaret Heckler. 

Harvard Univerity Law 
Professor Alan Dershowitz 
commented, "This is the first 
administration that has come 
into office with an agenda to set 
back civil rights libenies." , 
Indeed, said Dershowitz, "The 
Reagan Justice Depatment is 
hazardous to our constitutional 
health." 

"There is a word for the 
ideological tests for the judiciary 
which are seemingly in place in 
the White House and the Justice 
Department: said Senator Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan, D-N. y" "That 
word is corruption."

Justice Department is spending 
thousands of dollars prosecuting 
two black political activists in 
western Alabama for illegally 
helping 12 elderly and infirm 
residents of a nursing home in 
filling out absentee ballots for a

unemployment statistics show a 
dramatic increase in joblessness 
among minorities, particularly 
blacks, but a sharp decrease 
among whites.

rewarded. No executive at E.F.

spoke English. Not only is 
English rarely heard in

expressly forbidden. 

Anashes asked me if I would 
meet with him later that

hour or so. I want to learn about

When to love, when to condemn lHTfRSlfTTffi~ 
Continued from peat .. 

By KATHY BECKETT 
They caB themselves 

"Americans Concerned for 
Loving the Unwanted ." Sounds 
awfully magnanimous, doesn't it? 
In reality, the ACLU is an anti-
abomon group that recently 
conducted services for over a 
thousand fetuses in a protest 
against the right to choose 
abortion. Members of the ACLU 
contend that the fetus, as a 
member of the human 
community, is "entitled to the 
inalienable right to life." In the 
name of love for these unborn 
children, the "American's 
Concerned for Loving the 
Unwanted" are demanding a 
reversal of the Supreme Court 
decision ,(Roe vs. Wade. 1973) 
that declared the right to 
abortion constitutional. 

Anti-abortion groups such as 
the ACLU are inextricably tied to 
a conservative political 
philosophy. Representatives of 
this philosophy. such as Ronald 
Reagan. Jerry Falwell and Phyllis 
Schafiy. are united in their 
stance against abortion. These 
feruses have the right to live , 
they tell us , and to limit this 
right is nothing short of murder. 
Under more careful scrutiny. 
however, it becomes painfully 
clear that such groups' ·concern 
for loving the unwanted" stops as' 
soon as the child is born and 
begins to incur a cost on the 
state. Do they love them enough 
to ensure that they will have a 
good life , raised by someone 

responsible and mature enough 
to do so? Enough to provide 
their mothers with the financial 
help she will undoubtedly need 
when faced with the arduous 
task of supporting and caring for 
these children? Enough to 
guarantee that this child's diet 
will be nutritionally adequate? 
Enough to acknowledge that 
loving a child means the 

willingness to assume 
responsibility for that child's 
well-being? 

The answer to these questions 
is ' no." The Reagan 
Administration is staunChly , 
opposed to the right to choose ' 
abortion ; Simultaneously, it has 
raised the number of poor in 

this country to an all-time high 
of 22.9 million . Seventy five 
percent of these poor are women 
and children, a phenomenon 
social scientists refer to as "the 
feminization of poverty." The 
dramatic increase In the number 
of poor (from 15.1 million in 
1979) is largely due to major cuts 
in programs for the poor; 
between 1<}82 and 1985, these 
budget cuts have meant a 
decrease of 5.3 billion to the 
child nutrition program, .7 
billion to the food stamp 
program, f .B billion to aid to 
families with dependent children 
and 2.2 to low-income housing 
projects. In addition, the Reagan 
Administration has consistently 
down played the need for public 
day care facilities and is 
opposed to the concept of 
comparable worth , both of which 
would help alleviate some of the 
financial burden of being a full-
time worker/ mother. 

The result of the current 
administration's budget cuts, 
then , has meant that an 
increasing number of people, 
especially women and children, 
have been forced below the 
poverty line. If the 
administration's attempt to 
reverse the Roe vs. Wade 
decision is successful, the 
situation can only get worse .

substantial portion of this 
nation's poor, are now faced 
with the prospect of being 
deprived of the right to control 
their own bodies and their own 
futures . If women are not 
permitted to decide whether they 
are willing and able to properly 
care for children. the inevitable 
result will be more poverty and 
more reliance on government 
support. Parents of these 
unwanted children may feel 
helpless and frustrated. and may 
vent this frustration on their 
children . Child abuse and 
neglect are more common in 
households with younger or low-
income parents - a social group 
that will increase in size if legal 
abortion is abolished . 

Should the rights of potential 
lives supersede the rights of 
these women? Is it right that 
women , because of their 
reproductive capabilities, be 
forced by the government to 
assume a responsibility they may 
not be capable of handling? 
Should the cost of imperfect 
birth control methods be entirely 
a woman's to bear? I believe not. 
But for those who disagree , 
claiming that the fetus's right to 
life surmounts all other 
considerations, I have just one 
more question: in the name of 
love , can you condemn these 

child~TLto a life of poverty and 
insecurity - and demand that 
they bear the cost of your 
unwillingness to continue to 
"love" them after their birth? 

out that we are not working 
toward our freedom, but rather 
our destruction I would suggest 
you find a productive way to 
enlighten people. "Ameit macht 
frei" is a symbol· of hatred and 
pain and is used in the context 
of "super race" and genOCide. If 
your use of this slogan can be 
construed in any omer way than 
you mean for it to be, than you 
are achieving nothing except 
having people believe you are a 
fan of the Third Reich. 

To say that '''Albeit macht frei' 
does not condemn a race, it 
condemns us all, for we all 
cany stones, behind the gates of 
Auschwitz" is an intellectual 
exercise in smug disdain for 
those reading your letter. Your 
pseudo-eXistentialist explanation 
of the meaning of "Albeit macht 
frei" does nothin~ but trivialize 
the events of the Hider era" and 
show your own inability to offer 
a philosophical argument 
justifying your action.

planners to deSignate land such 
as fields or canyons as "open 
space" or "future urbanization." 
This means that the land cannot 
be used for new construction. 
Unlike "parkland ," the "open 
space" designation is not 
permanent. Parkland cannot be 
redesignated; however, the 
current wording of the Progress 
Guide allows the San Diego City 
Council to rezone open spaces 
for immediate development. 

With the passage of 
Proposition A, only a maiority

redeSignate an open space. The 
council could only "make the

patients, extensively burned 
patients and patients with 
severed limbs and organ 
transplants. The blood substitutes 
would be helpful in large scale 
emergencies and cut down the 
risk of disease in blood 
transfusions. 

The grant wiU directly support 
approximately 17 graduate 
students, four undergraduates 
and five post-doctoral associates. 

The 'Regents also granted 
approximately $10.5 million over 
a period of five years to the 
UCSD Specialized Center of 
Research in Arteriosclerosis. The 

designation more restricitive with 
respect to development." In other 
words, the council could still 
change "tuture urbamzatlon" lana 
to permanent parkland . 

Supporters of the measure say 
it preserves "the citizen's right to 
decide" and that in the past, 
special interest groups, 
particularly developers, have 
influenced the City Council to 
redeSignate land with little or no 
rega.rd for community needs or 
opinions. If voters do not "regain 
control," states the argument in 
the Voter Information Pamphlet 
published by the City of San 
Diego, there will be no recourse 
against crowding, pollution and 
urban sprawl. Supporters. say the 
current Progress Guide already 
allows for excess housing and 
job-producing industry. 

Opponents of the measure say 
it is ' unreasonable" and that 
there is a "a belter way" to 
manage growth . They say it will 
not prevent new construction but 
will cause it to be "jammed into 
existing neighborhoods," creating 
overcrowding.

Twenty-fifth anniversary series: 1960 
Munk genuflects to pre-UCSD era 

By KAREN KAWASAKI 
HIStory was made on ov. 18, 

1960 when a brand new 
university was officially 
christened the UniverSity of 
CalifornIa at San Diego. Dr. 
Walter Munk, director of the 
Institute for Geophysics and 
Planetaty Physics at Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography 
of 25 years, says, however, "At 
Scripps, we take a somewhat dim 
view of people thinking that 
there was nothing here before 
1960, since Scripps has been 
here since 1903. We kind of 
think of UCSD as a very recent 
development. 

"But," he adds, "i n the few 
years before 1960, the very small 
group here at Scripps was very 
active in trying to make sure that 
if a campus should develop, it 
would develop in the best 
possible way. 

"We soon decided, under 
Roger Revelle's leadershi p, that 
an optimum solution would be to 
have the campus contiguous to 
the land of the Scripps 
Institution, and Roger and others 
worked very hard with local 
citizens to attempt to get the 
land on which UCSD is now 
built." 

Although he calls it an 
exaggeration, Munk is sometimes 
leferred to as one of the 
"founding fathers" of UC5D 
along with other men including 
John Isaacs , Giff Ewing, Keith 
Brueckner and Harold Urey. It is 
Revelle , however, whom Munk 
calls "far and above the key 
person." It was also Revelle who 
made perhaps the greatest 
personal sacrifice in his efforts to 
establish UCSD. 

In 1961 , the Regents denied 
Revelle his dream of becomming 
UCSD's first chancellor when 
they named Dr. Herbert F. York-
to the position. It was thought 
that Revelle had made too many 
political enemies in his zealous 
effort to establish UCSD. 

"I was very much in favor of 
Revelle's idea to build a 
university and I was caught up 
in his ideas. I think it hurt him 
very much when he didn't 
become chancellor," Munk 
recalls. "I remember when they 
named Revelle College after him. 
He said 'I want a job, not an 
honor.' NO( that he didn't 
appreciate the honor, but he was 
looking for the reponsibility of 
leadership." 

Munk adds, "It was a personal 
disappointment that Roger didn't 
become chanceUor, although we 
soon became very happy with 

also attracted to the picturesque 
La Jolla surroundings. Munk 
explains. "I think a lot of them 
genuinely enjoyed the beauty of 
this area. We had a 101 of people 
from Chicago, where it is not 
particularly beautiful, but very 
stimulating. We used to be called 
the University of Chicago at San 
Diego - with the same Initials 
UCSD ." 

Munk also explains that 
although the campus was 
Isolated in 1960, " to some extent 
it was the isolation that many 
people who came here really 
liked - I'm one of them. I 
enjoyed the isolation of this area 
and I regret the loss of it. For the 

Walter Mun~, dirtCtor of the ~:~:-~~~~

the man who did come (Vork) 
- he did a fantastic job." 

In those early years at UCSD, 
the greatest concem was getting 
academic departments 
established. 'We had trouble 
getting mathematics started , but 
we had no troubles with biology, 
chemistry or physics. But then 
eventually we did succeed. 

"We thought that Scripps, in 
order to be the best possible 
institution, needed to have the 
fundamental sciences - physics, 
chemistry, mathematics, biology 
- in a nearby area, and, of 
course, that's been a very 
important part of our education 
process. Many of our students (at 
Scripps) now take classes at the 
upper campus, so it's been a very 
important thing." 

According to Munk, early 
recruitment of faculty was 
successful, and the kind of 
faculty that did come had "a 
spirit of adventure and 
excitement and the appreciation 
of what it means to be leading in 
a field . There is something about 
doing new work in a field that 
other people are paying attention 
to. There's no substitute for the 
excitement that got"s with it. The 
special work that was being done 
by these people was not second 
rate - it was leading, and I 
hope we can stick to that 
always ." 

New faculty members were 

students it was more dillicult -
they didn 't have families and a 
house, so being isolated away 
from a community must have 
been very hard on them ." 

Up until 1960, UCSD was 
commonly referred to as UCs 
School of Science and 
Engineering at La Jolla. In the fall 
of 1960, the school had a faculty 
of 30 and a student body, all 
graduate students, of 33. At 
Scripps, 75 students were 
enrolled in marine study under 
25 faculty members. 

Construction of the first twO 
buildings at the' School of 
Science and Engineering did not 
begin until February, 1961. Urey 
Hall, a hennetically sealed, 
seven-stery lab building was the 
first major building on the UCSD 
campus. This building was meant 
to be used by undergraduate 
students as well as graduate 
students. 

However, the first 
undergraduate students did nor 
enroll at the university until 
19M. Munk recalls the 
esrablishing of UCSD from the 
graduate level down to the 
undergraduate level: "It was an 
unusual experiment and it hadn't 
been done often. It had 
happened in Chicago - they, 
too. had started with a graduate 
school and worked toward 
younger classes. That was one of 
the principal ideas behind the 

UCSD concept. We had some 
very good senior people join us 
and they attracted very good 
younger people. I think if we 
had done it any other way, it 
would have been not nearly as 
good ." 

UCSD was structured, "as sort 
of a compromise between the 
enormous uniformiry of a UCLA, 
where there is no breakdown 
into units , and the very 
personalized colleges of the 
British system, like Cambridge 
and Oxford . It was something in 
betwee~ tht> fWO. At UCLA, you 
had some 20,000 odd students 
on a campus with no real 
structure. In the English colleges, 
you typically have 200 students 
per college. UCSD is 
intended for twO or three 
thousand students per college." 

Although UCSD was designed 
with a different structure than 
UCLA or UC Berkeley, in its 
nascent stages it still had to have 
support from both universities. 
Munk comments, "The UCLA 
support was not forthcoming. 
The Berkeley support was. They 
(UCLA) felt somewhat 
endangered by our plans and 
they were worried that we would 
compete with them for what they 
felt were resources (professors 
and students) that should belong 
to UCLA. That was a struggle. 

"We weren't really accepted by 
the other UC schools for about 
10 years, but I think that's 
nomial. You SOrt of have to have 
a decade to really have any 
meaning." 

The La Jolla community was 
also slow to accept UCSD. Munk 
remembers, "By that time (early 
19605) the community had 
gotten accustomed to Scripps so 
they were no longer upset by the 
institution. We'd been here for 
so long and although there were 
references to this 'biological 
shantytown' at the nonhern part 
of La Jolla, they thought we were 
sort of quaint. People went to 
look at our museum and our 
aquarium and it added to the 
community of La Jolla . But then, 
at first, UCSD was' a little more 
f"!ghtening to the community 

(than Scripps was)." 
After LaJolla became more 

comfortable with the univerSity, 
however, many opposed the 
name change from UC La Jolla to 
UC San Diego. In an editorial 
published in the San Diego Union 
on Nov. 22, 1960, results of a 
public opinion poll conducted by 
radio station KFMB were printed . 
In the countywide poll , residents 
voted more than three to two in 
favor of the La Jolla designation. 

The article also stated, 
"Political pressure apparently 
dIctated the University of 
Cali(ornia Regents' unfortunate 
action in deSignating the 
university's planned Torrey Pines 
campus as the University of 
California at San Diego .... Logic 
and planning demanded that the 
school be deSignated as the 
University of California at La 

Jolla, but they lost out to 
politics ... 

"Historically, the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography has 
been linked with La Jolla. Now 
the Regents have decided to 
confuse the issue by tacking 'San 
Diego' onto the deSignation of a 
new university . .. Perhaps a local 
sportscaster described best what 
the Regents have accomplished. 
He commented plaintively, 'How 
am I supposed to broadcast a 
football game between the 
University of California at San 
Diego and the University of San 
Diego being played in the San 
Diego Stare stadium at San 
Diego?' " 

Despite the struggles, setbacks, 
miX-Ups and political pressures 
in the early days, UCSD has 
emerged as a prestigious 
institution for higher learning. 
Munk concludes, "I guess we 
thought it would be successful. 
UCSD had idealism and 
optimism and in some ways our 
dreams were a little different. We 
thought the college system would 
play more of a part than it has 
so that students would feel more 
of a belonging to individual 

colle~ . But mainly, we hoped 
that it would consist of first-rate 
people and first-rate 
,;.-udents. " IZiJ

Bits of Wheeler luck 
By BRIAN JAUREGUI 

A shriek startled me from my 
sleep. A chirping sound 
immediately followed . What's 
happening, I thought. Shriek 
after shriek rattled the house. 
Then another's cty added to the 
discord. Who's hurt? What? 
Who? ... 

As I came out of my stupor, I 
groaned, realizing that the babies 
were crying. My sister, of course, 
lets the baby beeper run the 
usual five minutes Shut that 
damn thing off, I thought. 
Meanwhile, in the next room my 
brother's baby is squealing its 
litde piglet heart out. Summer 
was off to a screaming start. 

It's been four years ,;ince I've 
had to chronicle my summer for 
Mrs. Gregory, my high school 
English teacher. After twelve falls 
of those essays, I really don't 
miss them. But now, when I 
finally have something to write 
about, Mrs. Gregory isn't around, 
Oh, but you are - how about it? 

It was a weird, weird summer, 
How weird was it? Glad you 
asked. I'd just finished my fourth 
year of high school and was 
watching commencement. As I 

saw friends walk up and down 
the graduation ramp, I got a 
strange, uncomfortable feeling 
deep inside; I'm still nO( sure if it 
was the thought of many friends 
leayi ng, or if it was that I 
shuddered at the thought of 
another whole year. 

It was summer so I had to J 
provide my life with a little more 
that the Price Is Right and 
General Hospital. I think that 
there are generaUy ~veral ways 

upperclassmen spend their 
summers. What I call the elite 
group are those who take off to 
Europe for a month or two. How 
do starving students do this. a 
freshman might ask. Easy. U5I' 
what's left over from the 
financial aid loan. If that doesn 't 
come through, by the time you're 
out of college or going into your 
senior year. Mummy and Daddy 
will be so proud they will talk 
you into going. 

Then come the half-and-half 
people who work for part of the 
summer and play for the rest. Of 
course, there are those 

. unfortunates who have to work 
all summer with an occasional 
big night at EI Torito or the like. 

Allright, where do I fit in? 
Well, it's like this: You remember 
Bobby Wheeler from Taxi, the 
out of work actor? He's president 
of the next category. Yep, I'm in 
that one. You see, I like to think 
that since I didn't graduate, the 
spirit of Bobby Wheeler took me 
under its arm and thrust upon 
me all of its luck. 

My first bit of Wheeler luck 
forced me back to LA to live with 
four women. Now maybe I didn't 
deserve the Europe trip, but 
c'mon. no senior deserves to be 
sent to LA. Oh yeah, the four 
women. Well I admit there were 
some good points, especially if

niece. 

How was I forced back to LA? 
Well. after spending the first twO 
weeks of summer on a friend's 
living room floor, my back gave 
me the choice of LA or a 
crooked spine. I grudgingly went 
to LA (though I did look through 
medical books to see if maybe a 
crooked spine wasn't to() bad). 
Besides, my house on wheels, a 
1969 Ford Galaxy, was becoming 
a hassle to clean - the laSt four 
years of my life were crammed 
into it. 

Coming home to live is always 
a happy occasion. Hi mom, I'm 
home. I'm home, Steve and Jerri 
and baby Clinton. I'm, 
home ... wait a second, no one 
else? Cmon Mom, couldn't you 
fit any more relatives into a three 
bedroom house? I'd hate to think 
that I'm hogging the whole living 
room couch. Oh, hi Koala, boy 
(my IS-year-old dog). I pat him 
on the side. Oops, sorry I 
knocked you over. He flails 
trying to get up, like a turtle on 
its back. 

Next day, bright and early 
(11:00) I start looking for a job. 
Hey, no problem, I just finished 
four years of college; I'm practi-
cally a grad. I'm looking over the

absolutely still in the middle of the 
living room. Suddenly a lake of 
yellow is lapping at my feet I run to 
my dog. The stream still running, 
his expression is that of someone 
reading a newspaper on the toilet. 
Just sort of waiting it out. "Koala 
what are you doing?! (as if we both 
didn't know). I forgot, he's deaf 
(would he have undersrood if he 
wasn't?). "Get out of here! 

I go to get the door; the 
thing's wide open! I start to 
clean up, lay down the 
newspaper. It's SOrt of an 
unspoken rule around the house 
that animal stuff can sit around 
as long as its under newpaper. 
Oh, jeez, the newspaper. So 
much for today's job search; I 
think I'll playa little golf. 

A few days later a friend offers 
me a job for the day doing 
yardwork and tree-trimming. 
Money's low, so sure, why not? 
Next day I get up at 6 - the 
earliest I've awoken in about two 
years. We pick up another guy 
and we're off to work. We get to 
the job. "Listen," says my friend, 
''I'll be back around 3:00. Oh 
yeah, this guy doesn't speak 
English, so you can practice your 
Spanish. Let him know what to 
do. See you later." 

So great. Here I am stuck in a 
yard with my man-Friday. Let's 
see. "Uh, see this' Uh, esta 
(point ro bush). Cut, uh. tu 
cortas (poim ro him, then to 
shears. I open and close shears a 
few times) up to aqui (point to 
height on bush). He nods his 
head; I eagerly go off to dig out a 
stump. It's 20 minutes later, only 
7:20, and I've drank about a 
gallon of water; I go check on 
him. He's cutting tOO low. "Aqui, 
aqui: I point to the bush . He 
nods his head, mumbles a few 
words and starts again. Thinking 
maybe I should watch this guy 
closer, I go off to my stump.

FEATURES 

It's 8 am and my clothes are 
soaked with sweat; a little kid 
mistook me for the dirt monster, 
and I'm not having a good time. 
I'm starting to have ugly thoughts 
about my friend whose sitting in 
his air-conditioned classroom. 
My thoughts keep wandering to 
the Rambo torture scene. Time to 
check on my proteg~. Great, now 
he's cutting too high. I start to 
say something to him but it 
comes out, "Screw it". I'm not 
going to deal with it. He can cut 
the whole damn thing down if 
he wants. 

The day goes on and on and 
on and my friend finally comes ~ 
back at 3 pm. The guy saves his 
life by bringing food . We eat for 
20 minutes crouching on cement 
too hOt to sit on. Suddenly he's 
all jazzed about finishing the job. 
Only a quick three hours left, he 
says. Uh, sorry, my body's going 
to move nice and slow. 

Somehow that day I found 
myself back at home. The 1Vs 
on (I can't remember when 'it 
was ever off) and Jerry Dunphy's 
saying that a 60-year-old record 
was broken that day with a high 
of lOr. Wheeler luck again. 

The next month goes by, no 
job (maybe the dog pee was a 
sign of the job market), a litde 
more golf, a lot less money. The 
babies are still crying regularly in 
the night. Well, that pretty much 
sums up my summer. 

Wait a minute, friends , save 
your flowers . I did do something. 
Desperate, I went to summer 
school and took ... what else, 
Spanish.

Interested in Law? Health Care? 
If you're considering a career in 

either of these fields, or if you're jUst 
interested in social issues related to law 
or medicine, Warren College offers (wo 
interdiSciplinary Programs of 
Concentration that youll want to 
consider. 

The LAw &- Socit!y Program of 
Concentration offers you the 
opponunity to examine the role of the 
legal system and to study legal issues 
from the perspectives of political 
science, history, SOciology, and 
philosophy. You will consider how laws 
shape our society, and how our society 
is shaped by its laws. Political Science 
40, "Introduction to law & Society," is 
the introductory course required for 
this Program of Concentration. It will be 
taught in winter quaner '86 - so now's 
the time to check it out. 

The Health Care - Social Issues 
Program of Concentration considers 
social and ethical issues arising in 
modern health care. It includes 
coursework from philosophy, 
sociology, economics, anthropology, 
and urban studies. The introductory 
course for this Program is Sociology 40, 
"Sociology of Health Care Issues," 
which ,will be taught in spring '86. 
However, if you can't wait to get staned, 
you may be able to take other courses 
that apply to the program during winter 
quarter. 

For Warren students, both Law & 
Society and Health Care - Social 
Issues are classified as social science 
Prognms of Concentration, and are 
designed to complement the more 
specialized learning incorporated in 
your major. (If you're not sure whether 
one of these Prograrns would be 
contiguous or non-contiguous to your 
major, check with an Academic Advisor 
in the Warren ProvOSt'S Office.) Both 
Prognrns are greatly enhanced by the 
addition of an Academic Internship in 
a law- or health-related area. For 
Warren students pursuing the 8S 
degree in engineering, both Law & 
Society and Health Care - Social 
Issues are available as Area Studies. 
Students in !leveDe, Muir, and Third 
CoUeges may also pursue either of these 
programs as a minor.

Just shut up and take out the trash 
By PHIL LAUDER 

A FUNNY THING HAP-PENED to me on the way to taking out the trash 
yesterday. 

I had been on a roll. I had 
taken the two bouncing beautiful 
brown plastiC containers full of 
garbage out to their pre-
determined point of rendezvous 
with destiny for several weeks 
now, without fail. Evety 
Wednesday morning I had done 
this - emptying out the last 
wastebaskets in the house into 
the bigger trash cans in the 
garage , then opening the garage 
door and smelling the clean, 
warm morning air (mixed with 
the disgusting aroma of garbage), 
and then making my way, one 
trash can in each hand, the 
hundred feet or so to where they 
get picked up. 

But a funny thing happened 
this morning. I collected the cans 
and opened the garage door, and 
smelled the clean, cold morning 
air ... and winced. "God damn 
it's cold," were the next words 
out of my mouth. Instead of 
going back into the house for a 
jacket, which would have taken a 
minute at most but which I 
determined shrewdly to be too 
time-consuming a task, I trudged 
forth bravely, making my 
appointed rounds. What a guy. 

Stupid move. My hands had 
the look and feel of dry ice by 
the time I returned. My nose was 
cold, my ears were cold, and 
we'll stop there because you get 
the idea without my adding any 
more graphic details. 

All of you who came here from 
pans of the United States east of 
Yuma are calling me a wimp 
right now. "Christ, it's October 
24, big guy, it's supposed to get 
cold by now, and it ain't even 

RESTAURANT 
5 eANTINA 

U'HAPPY HOUR AT 
FUNDANGO'S ••• ONII OF 
TN. HAPPI.n .ROUIID" 

cold yet! If you can't handle 
seeing your own breath in late 
October, you're spoiled and 
wimpy and should spend a 
winter in Minnesota to wake up 
to reality. Try taking out the 
trash in a blizzard, OK, pal? Then 
bitch and moan." 

Look, I'm not bitchin' and 
moanin', I'm simply pointing OUt 
that it's staning to get cold. 
Sweaters are now the in thing, 
and jackets and parkas are close 

behind. It's getting cold. And 
wet. You have to spend a couple 
precious minutes every morning 
wiping the dew off your car 
windows. You have to spend 
those couple precious minutes 
with your car engine turned on 
so that you can expect to move 
when you get in and press the 
accelerator. When you get to 
school and head towards class, 
you have to walk around the 
grass fields unless you want to 

arrive to lecture with soppy 
shoes. As you walk down the 
main drag you must avoid the 
mini-puddles from the latest rain 
stonn; biqdists aim for these 
and will splash you at their 
earliest opponunity. 

Soon, rain storms will be 
coming around at a regular clip, 
and the daytime thermometer 
will plunge below 60, and we will 
officiaDy call it winter. Glorious 
winter to some - off to 
Mammoth for skiing, snuggling 
in front of a fireplace, crisp air, 
no smog. HeD to others - cold 
hands, wet feet, sickness arid 
disease and people sneezing all 
over you, fireplaces not lighting 
because the firewood is wet, all 
the roads to Mammoth closed 
and chains required , bring back 
the smog. 

They say San Diego has only 
one season. Bull. We have four 
just like the rest of 'em. Ours are 
better, that's aU. And season 
number four is just around the 
comer - tum left at the signal 
and you can't miss it. Even if 
you want to. Maybe someone else 
can take out the trash next time. 
Or at least get the garbageme~ to 
come to your garage and get It. 
That seems fair. Hell, it's cold OUt 
there. ~

Sailboarding: the sport of the Nineties 
Continued from page 1 

The state of the art in 
sailboarding is looping 360 

• degrees 01T a wave. Sailors hit a 
wave at a high speed in a critical 
zone to get maximum height, 
then loop the board upside 
down and around to do a 
"helicopter" in midair. A few 
have done it on camera, and one 
evcn made a double loop. 

EnthusiastS are calling 
sailboarding the sport of the '9Os. 
Other aspects of the sport 
include Olympic-sryle course 
racing, freestyling, slalom racing, 
recreational cruising, speed 
sailing and coastal runs or long 
distance crossings as well as 
rollercoaster wave sailing. 

San Diego is generally 
considered to be one of the best 
places in the world to learn. 

time, said going out in the waves 
was "devastating." He learned in 
the bay and liked it there 
because, he said, "When I get 
out of control, I really can't do 
any damage. I just drop my sail, 
hit a beach, or yell for help. I 
thought I was getting pretty hot 
on the bay, so I bought a wave 
board." His first time out he said 
he couldn't tum the board. "I just 
kept falling ofT and trying to 
uphaul in the waves ... and I 
have one of those Windsurfers 
where the universal just slips 
in ... so I went through a wave 
and I'm holding onto the sail but 
it's not attached to anything! I 
just lost it ... 3 I finally get back 
out and catch a wave and totally 
pearl and break my mast." But 
wasJoe charging Tourmaline 
again? "I'm addicted: he said, 
"I've bought three boards and I 
can't really ride them." 

"Speed" is another addicting 
aspeCt of the sport. Racers 
usually use long, thin boards and 
large fully-battened sails, They 
can reach up to 30 mph (the 
world's record is 32), and plane 
like a water skier. They use their 
bodies like shock absorbers; 
~ upright and bent knees to 

minimize chops and bumps.

Most people in the area learn 
at Mission Bay. The flat waters 
and light, steady winds make the 
bay a perfect spot for beginners, 
The Mission Bay Aquatic Center 
rents equipment and olTers 
beginning, advanced and clinic 
classes year-round, The courses 
are ' college subSIdized for 
students. "Many people attempt 
to teach themselves and get 
frustrated before they go to a 
class," according to one of the 
center's instructors, Monique 
Martineau. "But a few basic rules 
and tips really help," she said. 
Martineau saId that fall is a good 
time to learn because the crowds 
die ofT. 'People seem lO think 
the water is tOO cold , but actually 
it's warmer than the air in the 
winter. .. windsurfing is a great 
all-year spon." 

L... ..... ___ .... ______ ...... _______ -----'" speed, "I love the waves, but the 
Tounnahne SUli Park provides sailboarders with prime conditions. faster I go, the more intense it is. 

After students pass an 
introductory course, they an 
rent wetsuits for a dollar a day at 
the center, and board rentals are 
about $2 per hour. 

Instructors show students the 
basics on a land simulator, give 
short lectures and have the 
students spend most of the three 
hour sessions on the water. 
"Students are usually sailmg out 
and back by the second day," 
Martineau said. 

Another instructor noticed that 
women learn very easily , "They 
JUSt relax, balance, and cruise 
out, where guys try to use their 
anns "dnd muscle it. They look 
awkward ". even girls who think 
they are unaililetic can pick 
windsurfing up very easily," 
Sailboarding is considered a 

good sport for women to get 
involved in because it doesn't 
require great strength. Also , there 
is a relatively small number of 
professional and serious women 
boardsailors worldwide, 

Hawaii is considered the best 
spot in the world to boardsail, 
but it is not the best place to 
learn , The winds there gust 30 
knots every day and the water is 
rough , 

NOt only is Mission Bay great 
for taking lessons, it's also a 
good spot for freestyle , course 
racing and recreational cruising, 
People take bIg, f10aty boards out 
and do tricks like riding on the 
rail, going tandem, sailing with 
their backs to the sail and 
spInning the saIl. Freestyle is 
now an Olympic event. The 
woman who won the bronze In 
'84 sails in Mission Bay, 

The bay is a spot for local 
regattas, where sailors round 
buoys, usually in a triangle , on 
long race-boards This is a more 

technical side of the spon which 
is also a world-cup and ~lympic 
event and involves a fairly high 
level of strategy and technique. 
Slalom racing is done on shoner 
boards around buoys. Slalom 
races can be held in flat water or 
surf. 

Many boardsailors "graduate" 
to the waves after they've learned 
on f1atwater. Tourmaline surfing 
park in Pacific Beach is 
considered one of the best 
Southern California spots for 
waves and wind , Wave riding is 
much the same as surfing, except 
fo r the added power and speed 
of the saIl and footstraps on the 
board , Sailors do off-the -lips nd 
even aerial off-the-lips, then cut 
back and rollercoaster along the 
face of the wave on the inside, 
they Jibe and head back out to 
jump the waves instead of 
paddling through the surf to wait 
for a set.

UC Water-Polo turns it around: 
destroys CSULA and Chapman 
By DAVID TEDROW, Staff Writer 

Y OU MIGHT say the UCSD men's water polo team is on a roll, In their last 
three games, they have won by 
the "slim· average of 14 goals. 
After survivi ng a mild slump a 
couple of weeks back, the team 
is again playing at top form, 

Why the change? Better team 
defense, pure and simple. "Our 
defense played well in the close 
wins we had early in the season 
(against Pepperdine, fresno State 
and Loyola-Chicago)," explains 
sophomore hole-sener Larry 
Sanders, "And we lost a couple of 
close games later on due to 

defensive breakdowns." The 
resurgent Triton defense was 
evident last week as the team 
crushed Cal State Los Angeles 
10-4 and then bombed 
Chapman 25-4 the next day, 

This is the first year that 
Chapman has had a water polo 
program, so the game was more 
of a sCrimage for the TritohS. 
UCSD J.V. coach Dana Greisen 
feels , "Water polo teams need 
time to develop, So it's sort of an 
unwritten rule that you doO't go 
out and destroy young teams by 
playing your staners the entire 
g;tme: The Triton starrers 

concentrated on their 
fundamentals , and - believe it 
or nOt - did not try to score as 
much as they could. The second 
string played most of the game, 
and even Greisen's j.V. players 
saw plenry of action , 

At Cal State Los Angeles, 
however, the water polo program 
has had plenty of time to 
develop. And they've deve&oped 
into a strong, aggresslw team, as 
their top 20 ranking would 
suggest. The game plan CSULA 
employ, is to physicaBy beat its 
opponent. Sanders feels UCSD, 

Please tum to page l~ 

I get really hooked on it." He 
said he sails Ensenada, Lake 
Lopez, Hurricane Gulch (San 
Pedro), San Felipe (the Gulf), 
and Silver Strand's beach near 
Coronado, for good winds, 
Kilometers 38 and 39 in Mexico 
are only an hour and a half drive 
from UCSD, and 109 is one of 
the best sailing spots in 
California and Mexico according 
to the pros. It's easy to find the 
spot where the waves tube off 
the point.

Lady runners 
finish first 
By ERICA GLENNON 

W HETHER OR not cross country can be classified as a 
spectator sport, the 1985 Triton 
cross-country team is (according 
to its coach, Andy Skief), 
"definitely worth watching," The 
women's team has been 
described by Skief as being one ' 
of the better teams he's seen in 
the last four years al UCSD, 
consisting mostly of freshmen 
and sophomores, Led by 
standouts Mary Siefert, 
(sophomore) and Sabrina Jensen 
(freshman ). the women took first 
place overall last Saturday 
defeating Point Lorna, USIU and 
USD al home, "The women are 
an impressive young group and 
if we can keep most of the 
runners over the next TWO 
seasons, they'll have a good 
chance at a bid for the 
Nationals ," said Skief, 

The women's team receives 
some additional coaching by 
UCSD graduate and former team 
member Kim White, White 
helped to prepare the girls for 
last Saturday's meet by having 
them run Mt. Soledad repeats. 
This involves running to the top 
of Mt. Soledad which is over a 
mile, and all uphill, White 
believes this drill contributed 
Significantly to the women's 
success last Satprday. 

Mary Siefert, who placed first 
in Saturday's meet attributes 

much of the success of the team 
to the fact that they are close-
knit and supportive of one 
another, "We get along well ," 
comments Siefen, "and that 
makes the practices a lot easier." 

The 1985 men's learn is 
experiencing a rebuilding year, 
but the Triton men managed to 
place second overall in last 
Saturday'S home meet. 
Sophomore Chris McNatt feels 
that the men are giving a great 
team effon. "There is no 
animosity on our team. We're all 
doing the same thing. The entire 
team goes out to dinner together 
on Friday night before the meet," 
comments Chris, Coach Skief, 
who's been at UCSD for 17 
years, continues to condition the 
team by creating long-distance 
runs and instilling in them the 
type of leadership and 
competitiveness that is necessary 
to win. He would like to see the 
women run more aggressively 
and relentlessly, and presently 
sees continued improvement in 
both teams daily, The Tritons 

p~pare to face Cal Lutheran this 
Saturday and return home on 
November 2 to host USIU. 

Cross-countl}' is one of the 
most grueling yet unrecognized 
sports today, and many Tritons 
feel this is a bit disappointing. 
Head coach Andy Skief doesn't 
understand why it's 
unrecognized, only that it's been 
this way notoriously. "It's

UC runner Sabrina Jensen finished 
fourth ovtrall and shows the 101/ it took, 

exciting, the masses of runners, 
it's an aesthetic background, but 
even now with so much road 
racing, its receives vel}' little 
recognition," states Skier. Even 
team member Steve Steck feels 
part of the problem may be that 
it is difficult to follow the runner 
throughout the course.. "It's a 
spon that doesn't lend itself to 

spectators: states Steck. Coach 
Skief and team aren't prepared to 
allow their lack of recognition to

,. Fencing In the Foil competition, there were 22 fencers, First place was taken by Xandy Brown of the 
Mori Fencing Club in Santa 
Monica, who had no losses, 
Kevin Mills, the UCSD Foil 
captain, was second with only 
two losses. Third place was 

Pomona next week, Oct. 26, from 
1-5 in the afternoon at the Rec. 
Gym, This is a great chance to 
see what fencing is all about!) 

In the Epee competition, there 
were 16 fencers. First place was 
given to Wulf Carson , with one. 
loss. Wulf is a UCSD student 
and was captain of Epee in 

captain and a possible tor the 
nationals, Third place went to 
John Nolan of Salle Counier ( Le. 
Counier Fencing Club) in Los 
Angeles, He had only three losses 
all day, 

members, led by team captain 
Greg Chow (a two-year veteran), 
are not quite seasoned veterans 
yet. Tim Ash had only half a 
season competition last, year, All 
others are breaking into 
competition for the first or 
second time since they began 
training, so the TritOns are 
exhibiting the growing pains in 
this competition .

If Fletcher Christian and Captain Bligh had 
known what being stuck in the same boat 
would mean, chances are neither would have 
set foot aboard. 

And if you're stuck in the same boat with a long 
distance company that doesn't give you all the 
services you need, it's easy to harbor mutinous 
thoughts. 

But when you pick AT&T as your long distance 
company, you know you're in for smooth sailing.

on the other hand , "relies more 
on skill than on physical 
strength because our size doesn't 
match up well with the better 
teams in the narion." But water 
pOlo is a physical sport, and the 
LA game was a good physical 
game, with the usual amount of 
pushing and shoving, according 
to Sanders, It was the quicker 
Tritons who prevailed however 
as their relentless defensive 
pressure prevented Cal State's 
offense from ever getting out of 
the starting blocks, ·Our defense 
pressed out well . and so we kept 
them from setting up their 
offense," observed Sanders, 
CSULA did have a few great 
scoring opportunities when they 
had UCSD in man-down 

situations on several occasions. 
But in these insrances, Duncan . 
MUlar's excellent shot blocking 
made an already good defensive 
game a great one for the Tritons. 

This Saturday at II , it's 
showdown time at Canyonview 
as the Tritons take on the 
Anteaters of UCI. UCSD will 
need to playa great game, both 
offensively as well as defensively 
if they expect to upset the 
number three team in the nation, 
It is games like this one that the 
Tritons must win in order to 
receive an at-large bid to the 
Division I Championship 
Tournament, Unfortunately they 
will have to win this one without 
one of their best players, 

Two weeks ago, starting two-
meter man Steve Schatz was 
taken to the hospital with severe 
stomach pains, Exploratory

was discovered that pan of 
Steve's intestine had collapsed, "' 
had grown a pocket in the lining 
of my small intestine," the junior 
from San Diego explained, "It 
became inflamed, and about a 
nine-inch segment of the 
intestine telescoped in on itself, 
causing a complete blockage." 
Schatz lost 20 pounds during his 
five days in the hospital, and will 
not be able to play for the 
remainder of the season. 

Schatz feels that the team is 
playing well anyway, ·We won 
some games earlier in the year 
with Dan (Kahl) out, and we 
won with Tom (Moore) and me 
sick, 50 they can win if they play 
well," he said. -Can they beat 
UCl? "There's no doubt we'll be 
the underdog. but if we playas 
well as we can defensively," said 
Schatz. "and don't tum the ball 
over on offense, we should do • 
tery well." lm

tpaul Brach: A Retrospectlve~munily 
by jay greathOUIe 

In conjunction with UCSD's 25th anniversary, 
the first chairman of the Visual Arts Department 
has an exhibition of his works at the Mandeville 
Gallery through Nov. 3. This is Paul Brach's first 
show at the gallery. He chaired the department 
from 1967-1969. The exhibition is a 30-year 
retrospective of Brach's paintings with the bulk of 
the work consisting of the more recent nocturnal 
d~rt paintings that Brach describes as "evoking 
the silent spaces of the Southwest." Thev express 
his description of an ideal place, "distanced by 
reveries and memoriet of boyhood summers on a 
ranch in Arizona." . 

Brach has achieved a national reputanon as an 
artist, critic and educator and has exhibited 
throughout the United States. A graduate of the 
University of Iowa (he has a bachelors and a 
masters degree in Fine Arts) currently living in 
New York City, Brach has seen his work acquired 
by the Museum of Modem Art and the Whitney 
Museum of American Art in New York; the Los 
Angeles Museum of Art; the University of New 
Mexico; and by John Muir College at UCSD. (His 
Muir painting can be seen on the north wall of the 
Gate # 1 gallery.) 

It would be too easy to wax eloquent on the 

visual qualities of Paul Brach's work, but with 
access so readily available it would be a sin - of 
the intellect against art - to bias your experience 
of this quality of his painting. Nonetheless, it 
should be pointed out that some critics would see 
a symbolic personal departure from the neutrality 
of the mainstream towards a regional statement. 
Clearly however, this is not the case. From his 
series titled "Manifest Destiny," a reference to 
the 19th century paintings of the advancing 
frontier to his "Pale Rider, " a single rider 
galloping across a silent landscape with a vast sky 
and low lying hills, he is evoking the stage of the 
United States' Western Myth. 

The ubiquitious nature of our myth in all its 
variations is evident today throughout Europe 
and the Third World. As the "cowboys" defend 
civilization from the "Indians" in the Union of 
South Africa it is important to see that it is our 
culture that values apartheid. In this sense, 
Brach's work asks us to reflect upon the world as 
it was before it was subdued by merchants, 
politicians and scientist. Perhaps the world, like 
the Southwest that Paul Brach loves and shows to 
us, was not such a bad place before our 
civilization conquered it.

Editor: 

I found the article that 
Steve Hamilton wrote in the 
Oct. 17 issue of Hiatus very 
upsetting. It seems to me that 
Mr. Hamilton should go, or 
perhaps even be escorted, to 
the educational and cultural 
places tha t Mexico has. Not so 
that he can deprive himself of 
going to the bars and cabarets 
that many tourists like him 
attend, but simply so that he 
can expand his criteria i~ 
regards to a country that has 
much, much more to offer. 
Perhaps in doing so, Mr. 
Hamilton will erase the 
stereotype notion that Mexico 
can be judged only by visiting 
Tijuana, Medio Camino and 
Ensenada. 

Unfortunately, the 
sensitivity and choice of 
words with which he wrote his 
piece, furthermore reflect the 
lack of cultural understanding 
that many Americans, like 
Mr. Hamilton, have when 
they do not know anything 
about a foreign country. 

Perhaps it would be useful 
for Mr. Hamilton to stop in 
our library and pick up some 
articles that will help him 
come out of his ignorance.

EXRosing literature 

Policing the book beat 
by robert leone 

"On the phone, Spencer said urgently, 'He's gone mad ... He's out 
in the middle of the concourse with a sledgehammer drooling about 
catching giant birds in parchutes and feeding them to the gophers!' " 

It's just one of those days in the fictional Hong Bay area of Hong 
Kong; where a junior detective, deafened by stereos, electric guitars, 
elaborate TV systems, and a gasoline powered chainsaw, gets even 
with an apartment complex. 

The Far Away Man, William Marshall's latest installment in the 
Yellowthread Street series, has all the hallmarks of his usual light 
fare. The book is funny, sad, insightful, sensitive, and a bit of a 
showoff. It begins with an almost wordless gunman holding a jade 
shop owner motionless for 40 minutes with a very threatening gun, 
and then .... 

Well, to tell you what happens next would be giving to much 
away. However, Inspector Harry Feiffer starts investigating the 
murder, and the bodies begin to accumulate. The bodies are those of 
an embezzling military officer, a vagrant shoeshine man, a fortune 
teller, and an outboard motor manufacturer, an assortment of 
people who would never be connected. If that were not mysterious 
enough, the victims all possess cholera vaccination certificates 
belonging to other people. 

Marshall's much-demonstrated talent for creating the most bizzare 
of crimes has reached a new peak. He has also reached a new high in 
his comic relief (a treat in all, save the grimmest, of Marshall 's work), 
when Inspectors Auden and Spencer, perhaps the oddest couple in 
the history of police procedurals, are sent to investigate High~Dive 
Henry, who regularly jumps off the 27th floor of a 14-story building, 
hitting the ground with a tremendous, fatal splat. The only problem 
(s that there are no traces of Henry . Henry's impact on the detectives 
is a little more substantial, leading to one committing massive 
destruction with a ten~pound sledgehammer. 

In some respects, such as the cleverness of the plotting, this latest 
is the equal of any of Marshall's works . However, as a mystery, it is 
,not Marshall's best, because even by the lax rules of fiction writers, 
he does not play fair with the readers. The mystery is solved more by 
flashbacks than by deduction. One of the detectives is a friend of the 
killer, so the reader has no chance of figuring out whodunit before 
the cops do.

The familial theory of tRelativity' 
by marpret carlin 

John and Phil Cunningham, 
Trlona NC Dhomhnaill and 
MCchelll CY Domhnaill have 
been enchanting audiences 
with the sounds of Celtic folk 
music from their recently 
released album Relativity 
during their current 25-date 
U.S. tour, which includes two 
shows at the Old Time Caft! 
tomorrow. 

Blending Celtic traditional 
with original music, Relativity 
offers beautiful ballads and 
lively reels. The combination 
of fiddle Oohn), accordion 
(Phil), clavi net (Trlona) and 
guitar (MichellI) creates a 
simple harmonious sound 
with a charming quality sure 
to set many hearts to remi~ 
niscing. 

theatre and television. Trlona 
Nt Dhomhnaill is currently 
involved with the North 
Carolina group Touchstone. 
With all this activity, 
Relativity had been an idea for 
nearly two years before it 
could become a recorded 
reality in the summer of/ '84. 

"I'm the only one of all four 
of us who lives back in 
Scotland," says Phil. "The 
other three are living here 
now, so I didn't hear as much 
about it as they would, but L 
kept . getting an update every 
month - 'are you still on for 
it?' - and it would drag on! 
Then finally we got a time we 
were all available." 

The lovely "Gracelands" 
has a sweet, sentimental 
melody. "The Soft Hone 
Reel" is inspiring enough to 
let up and dance a jil, an 
active song. "The Pernod 
Waltz" is like a light breeie-
refreshinl· 

Omtrary to appearances, the creators of the albwn 'Reiati"ir,' do not do it with mirrors 

The one~month Relativity 
tour is the first time the four 
have performed together as a 
unit. On whether there are 
any future plans to record or 
perform together, Phil says, 
"At this point it'. so nice that 
we've been doing it because 
we want to do it. We don't 
know whether we'll continue 
with it. We'U just take it as it 
comes. At the moment it'. a 

one~n. We'd all like to get 
back tQldher next year to 
record, but it all largely 
depends on the success of this 
tolK."

Triona smp "An Seanduine 
Doite" with a refined 
contralto voice. Not havinl 
Gaelic as their first lafllUA&e, 
the Cunninghama had to read 
the words in phonetics for 
some of the chord. while 
recording the album - a task 
that was "good fun," as 
younger brother Phil puts it. 

"I Uve up in the north end 
of the Isle of Skye now, and 
the actual area I'm in is the 
biggest Gaelic~.peaking 
community per head of 
population in Scotland. so it's 

an ideal. place to learn ·it. My 
daughter learns it in school 
and I'm trying to learn it, 10 
this is a great opportunity for 
me." 

A. for the audience, Phil 
explains, "They appreciate 
the Gaelic sonp just the same 
as the English ones. There '. a 
certain beauty in a.elic songs 
whether you under.tand them 
or not. There's something in 
them that's a heartfelt thing." 

. Though not a folk~rock 
band, rock rhythms and 
chordings provide a familiar 
sound for those not 
acquainted with this type of 
music. "I think the more

Yo shows its 
getup and go 
by robin lCott 

It was about a year ago that 
Yo released its first recording, 
Good Tidings. At that time I 
held the opinion that this was 
a band that would go 
nowhere. Ita sound was 
original enough but the group 
seemed to lack the neceuary 
distribution. packaging, 
expolure and general business 
mechanics that, sadly, "make 
or break" a band. 

Yo has since released a full~ 
length album, which it has 
supported with two separate 
tours. It i. hereby my intent to 
amend my earlier verdict. 

Yo is a band that 8eeI1\S to 
be slowly and steadily 
generating a solid core of fans . 
This i. not to say that Yo has 
attained the stature of a "cult 
band," a phrase critic. like to 
throw around to explain 
limited public interest; vet, 
they have clearly attracted a 
number of avid followers. 

Yo has succeeded in this 
because it ia unique musically 
as well a.lvrically - the latter 
more 10 than the former. The 
group has developed a distinct 

expression in the rock world 
whose concerns are increas-
ingly more limited. 

Journalists are fond of 
applying little catch label. to 
describe a certain lOund or 
movement; some of these 
stick, most are forgotten. Far 
be it from me to enpge in this 
trivial and sloppy tradition. 
Of course, if I were to assiSO 
Yo sue'h-a label, it would be 
something like "nursery 

rhyme~punk" or "play~ 
ground~ore" (not to be 
confused with "bubblegum 
punk"), because the music 
and lyrics have the repetition 
and catchy rhythms found in 
nursery rhymes combined 
With the rage and energy of 
early punk sound •. The songs 
are childlike but filled with 
anger toward the force. of 
corruption that threaten 
innocence. Theae two polar 
elements provide the music 
with an interelting tension. 

Musically, this is not a 
terribly compUcated band. 
Most of itl sonp relv on 
three~hord progressions -

Gaelic traditional music, (the 
more) the younFf people 
who haven't been expoled to 
It before are Iikelv to stay and 
listen to it - give it a second 
shot." . 

The Cunningham. are 
former members of Scot-
land'. Silly 'Wizard and 
T nona and Mkhelll were in 
Ireland's Bothy Band, two of 
the key groupe behind Celtic 
traditional music of the '70s. 
Traditional music was all 
around them when they were 
growing up, since they both 
come from families with a 
musical heritage. . 

In his VOl~th, Phil would sit 
around playing accordion at 

partie.. He recalls, "Jdtnny 
started off in Silly Wizard. I 
was going to ., to the 
university and study languqe. 
When I was 16, SUly Wizard 
was goilll and the opportunity 
are»e for me to join so I 
decided to drop all else and go 
pn the road. I think my 
interest in music actually grew 
a lot more... my interest in 
doing it as a professional grew 
more once I started in Silly 
Wizard." 

As solo artists, the four 
have proved themselves to be 
exceptional musicians 
involved with producing, 
composing, arranging and 
performing for albums, 

With a sell~ut fourth 
concert in Somerville, 
Massachu.etts, it would 
appear that the audience is 
with them right from the start. 
"It's quite heartening," relates 
Phil.

theme. it addresses seem to be

contemporary bands. The

It must be admitted that the

too preoccupied with death, 
but not u a vehicle for 
,,!amour, as the Sisten of 
Mercy and The March Violets 
tend to use it, but more a. a 

license . to explore fully the 
fleeting dimensions of this 
brief life. The remarkable 
lOng "Train of No Return" 
best expresses these 
sentiments: "Start with zero 
the chance of millions! You 
know how things are! You're 
out to find, you'll take your 
fill! Of the torture of the 
times/ On the train of no

La Jolla arid the coming of fall 
Keith Grant Davie, in the 

writing program, once 
submitted an essay to the old 
Triton Times on the 
migrational behavior of snails. 
It was an arresting story: 
Armies of snails crossing the 
highways at night after spring 
rains were crushed by the tires 
of cars and trucks. Evolution 
had provided the snails with 
no defenses in that situation. 

There are, ' of course, other 
instances of seasonal 
adaptation and response 
around us, eccentric but less 
bizarre. 

Fall in California is always 
an ambiguous season. It 
arrived early this year, wisps 
of fog and drops of rain 
sandwiched berween days of 
such blazing intensity that the 
health of inland chickens was 
a worry to the farmers. In La 
Jolla, there has been a 
pschological effect. Mid-
September, a house on 

Rushville Street put up its 
Christmas lights; a house 
across the street countered 
almost immediately by 
installing its wreath . House 
number one added pumpkins 
to its decor and is now 
decorated in anticipation ,!f 

by 8usan murphy 
all probable occasions 
through Valentine's Day of 
1986. It is thew house next to 
the one in which Keith Grant 
Davie lived. They are a 
precocious lot. 

Meantime, the neighbor-
hood opossums have also 
been showing an interest in 
autumn and one has moved 
into my garage. Truthfully, 
opossums flourish in all 
seasons berween Pearl Street 

and Bon Air (Place, Street or 
Way). Many sightings have 
been made of opossums 
crossing after dark, and they 
are increasing in number. A 
Literature professor returned 
home one night within recent 
memory to find an opossum 

curled up on his doormat. An 
Englishman not familiar with 
all North American fauna, he 
thought he had been visited by 
a large rat. 

Rancho Santa Fe has foxes, 
coyotes and, yes, even deer. 
Skunks are ubiquitous. We 
have marsupials.,Idon't know 
whether our opossum is 
arboreal (in the rafters), or 
burrowing (behind the 
books). (The aquatic variety 

seems unlikely.) It eats cat 
food and is nocturnal. The cat 
and dog are afraid. 

Originally, turning on the 
light in the middle of the night 
in order to see the opossum, 
we could only catch a glimpse 
of its long, ratlike tail 

disappearing into the garage. 
Now it is bolder and stares 
back. Sometimes I think I see 
other, smaller opossums 
running across the patio. As 
they move very fast, and only 
in peripheral vision, I may be 
hallucinatinlj opossums. 

As long as the cat food 
holds out, qu' impanel 

One final thought on this 
subject. The literature on 
opossums is authoritative, but 

conflicting. After the usual, 
aghast description of their 
fecundity, the EnqclopetJia 
Brirtanica (Vol. 16, 1959, p. 
814) informs: "The young are 
often carried on the mother'S 
back, holding to her fur or 
clinging to her tail by their 
own prehensile tails. II The 
French (Larowse Encyclo-
paedia of Animals, 1972, pp. 
482-3) are not in accord: 
"The mother climbs along the 
branches" - or, rafters -
"with a whole litter on her 
back. There is, however, no ' 
truth in the well-established 
idea that they maintain their 
position by winding their tails 
'round the mother'S tail. II 

There must be moral in this 
for graduate students, as they 
are always being told to check 
their sources. Meantime, I'm 
thinkin8 of writing the Purina 
Company in case they want to 
rethink the attractiveness of 
ori~inal formula chow.

A Late · Night 
. by fred steinmetz 

the genre seems to have 
attracted interest mosdy as a 
novelty and not as a serious 
field . 

When asked why, given his 
background with harder-edged 
bands. he chose the cow punk 
sound. Almaas commented, "I 
think that it would be ludicrous 
to be doing now what I was with 
Crackers or the Suicide 
Commandos. Beat Rodeo isn't a 
concept - it sounds that way 
because of the people in the 
band." 

Steve Almaas, ex of the 
Suicide Commandos from 
Minneapolis and the New York-
based Crackers, has made the 
transition to country pop 
through Beat Rodeo. If one were 
to start out by listening to an old 
Sex Pistols record, there would 
be a logical, though not aural, 
connection to a PiL record. 
However, if one were to listen to 
a Suicide Commandos record 
and then the Slaying Oul Late 
With Beat Rodeo album, the 
effect would be eqvivalent to 
driving down Interstate 5 
listening to a party tape. 
popping the cassette out and 
finding that your father has 
borrowed the car and changed 
the station to local country fave 
KSO . 

It is with some interest that I 
note that Mitch Easter , 
producer for REM and general 
big guy with the Rodeo's IRS 
Records labelmate Let's Active \. 
played with Almaas in Crackers 
for eight months before he 
decided to move down south to 
start a recording studio. It was 
in this studio - Drive-In -
that Beat Rodeo recorded 
Stayzng Out Late . .. which was 
released in England on Zensor 
Records before the band was 
Signed to IRS laSt spring. Other groups have followed a 

similar path. Rank and File rose 
from the Dils, a Southern (and 
later Northern) California 
hardcore band. San Diego's 
own Beat Farmers sprung out of 
the Penetrators. a Knack-alike. 
then rockabilly concoction that 
was famous for playing parties

Playing the game with Momix 
bv marla hellman 

What is Momix you ask? ·'The name, once a milk supplement for veal calves. 
became the title for a solo by Moses Pendleton commissioned by the 1980 
Winter Olympics. It is now the name of one of the world's leading innovative 
dance companies. " Momix, is still something that refuses to be categorized, It in 
the words of its founder and director Moses Pendleton. 

The performance group of four. now going into it's fifth year, has the 
potential for expansion and grows when needed to include a constant stream of 
performers. Momix's hometown of Washington, Connecticut is unusual 
because of its population of 1500, approximately 10 percent are professional 
dancers, thus providing an incredibly creative environment for the company. 
Pendleton, who also co-founded Phibolus (another performance dance 
troupe), began Momix to provide a new stomping ground for experimentation. 
He asserts, "Performances are kind of like structured improvisations." 

"The acrobatic dance group that turned the traditions of modern dance and 
ballet upside down in its quest for novelty, Momix champions game-playing 
with props," wrote Janice Ross of the Oakland Tribune. She applauds that 
" Momix uses formulas of provocative situations and lusty movement to make 
fleeting statements. tt Momix breaks out of the confines of traditional dance in 
its quest for non-repetitious performances, and promises an exciting evening of 
innovative dance. And if you still don't know what Momix is, find out Friday at 
8 pm in the Mandeville Auditorium. Tickets are $lOfor general admission, $8 
for UCSD faculty! staff and sr. citizens, $6 for students, and are available at the 
UCSD Box Office.

Mo' Yo 
Continued from page 3 

On its most recent album, 
Yo demonstrates a broader 
range of concerns. The group 
manages to retain its engaging 
lyrical sense, as is indicated by 
the title cut, a satire on the 
abundance of earthly 
diversions with which to loose 
oneself in: " A world loved by 
every creature! from a rhino 
to a preacher! What they 
want they want, and whatthey 
want they want! In charm 
world, it's yours for the 
taking. It 

If you can imagine diese 
lyricS delivered in a voice 
somewhere between singer 
Morrissey (of the Smiths) and 
Bela Lugosi, then you have a 
pretty good idea of how this 
band sounds. 

I'm not ready to dump all 
my chips in favor of thie Bay 
Area trio quite yet. Yo is still a 
bit too one-dimensional in 
song structure - a common 
flaw in young bands. The 
group has , however. 
demonstrated longevity and 
increasing maturity as a band. 
I am hopeful that its next 
album will develop the signs 
of genius that its early efforts 
have displayed. 

If you missed Yo's 
appearance at the Spirit club 
last July , do not despair , for 
they are returning this 
Saturday evening to play the 
same venue. For information 
call 276-3993.
