Co-headliners

By JESSICA KRUSKAMP 
Senior Staff Writer 

Double-headliner s 
Tenacious D and The Strokes 
delivered powerful sets to a 
sold-out RIMAC Arena on 
Tuesday night. 

Jack Black, lead vocalist for 
Tenacious D, proclaimed that 
"no night has ever been more 
monumental" in terms of tJ1C 
musical talents slated for one 
show. He likened the concert to 
one in which Bach would open 
for Mozart. 

That said, Black and band-
mate Kyle Gass launched into a 
set that had the crowd scream-
ing disdainful obscenities, danc-
ing to the music and breaking 
into hysterics at the onstage 
antics. 

"The D" exercised their 
vocal range. The singers' voices 
beautifully reached high notes, 
and aggressively barked lyrics 
about Burrito Supremes, toi let

U.S. Senate passes bill requiring 
proof of residency for new voters 
New law could have an impact on UCSD students 
whose primary residence is not in the San ·Diego area 
By TOM NEELEY 
Staff Writer 

In response to issues raised after 
' the 2000 presidential election, the 
U.S. Senate passed a bill Apri l 11 
that would force first-time voters 
to show proof of local residency. 

The bill requires that first-time 
voters provide a va lid form of 
identification with the voter 's 
address on it. Under the new bi ll , 
first-time voters will only be 
allowed to vote in the district that 
their identification says mey live 
111 . 

Because many college students 
maintain a permanent address dif-
ferent than their address at school, 
this could prevent fi rst-time stu-
dent voters from participating in 
local elections near their university. 

Studen ts can s till vote via 
absentee ballot in their home elec-
tions. 

Ayame Nagatani, a freshman at 
Eleanor Roosevelt College, said 
an ID requirement is ultimately 
detrimental to increasing voter 
turnout. 

"People aren't real ly going to 
want to go through the process of

she said. "There are going to be 
less people voting, I think, because 
it is going to be more of a hassle." 

David Chung, a freshman at 
Thurgood Marshall College, said 
he felt more strongly about the 
new requirements. 

"I feel that since we do live 
within the San Diego region, and 
we are residents, ... spend most of 
our time here, ... [and deal) with

Muir council passes 
ban on slate politics 
A similar proposal was rejected by 
Thurgood Marshall College Council 
By BRENT HECHT 
Staff Writer • 

Muir College Council delivered 
a blow to the power of all-campus 
slates last week when it banned all 
future Muir senatorial candidates 
from joining the campuswide polit-
ical conglomerates. 

Muir Senior Senator Jacob 
Knapp and Muir College Council 
Vice President Ben Epperson led 
the move to ban slates from Muir 
senatorial elections. They drafted a 
referendum admonishing 1.he partic-
ipation of slates in Muir's senatori al 
elections. 

The council, which unanimously 
approved the refci endum, then 
moved to change its bylaws to 
reflect the spirit of me referendum. 

"Our fundamental goal was to 
bring things back to [Muir) ," said 
Epper on, who served as Muir col-
lege's representative to the 2002 
A.S. Council election committee. 

"Muir college wants senatorial 
candidates to focus on Muir col-

lege," K.!l.Ipp "ml. "We hope thi\ 
will help can,hdare\ han: a lIlore 
effective camp:lIgn on the college

Academic 
Senate opts 
to endorse 
new test 
The S.A.T. I moves 
another step closer 
to elimination from 
UC admlssions 
By CLAIRE J. VANNETTE 
Senior Staff Writer 

The SAT. I suffered another blow 
Tuesday when UCSD's arm of the 
UC Academic Senate endorsed a plan 
calling for a new standardized admis-
sions test for the University of 
California. 

UC President Richard C. Atkinson 
called for eliminating the SAT. I 
from the UC admissions process just 
over a year ago. 

The senate passed two resolu-
tions, the first stating that it agrees 
that "the SAT. I ought to be 
replaced" with a unique test for 
admissions. However, the second 
insists that current proposals on that 
new test should be examined for 
problems and inconsistencies. 

Atkinson said';n February 2001 
that the test is not an accurate indica-
tor of college success and does not 
measure actual high school achieve-
ment. 

"Applicants for higher education 
should be assessed on the basis of 
their achievements in high school ... 
not how they rate on an ill-defined 
measure of aptitude or intelligence," 
Atkinson said at an address before the 
American Council on Education. 

In November 2001, Atkinson fur-
ther criticized the test, whose scores, 
he said, "only tell a student that he or 
she scored higher or lower than his or 
her classmates." 

The discussion at Tuesday'S meet-
ing was in response to the Committee 
of Admission's analysis of a report 
called "The Use of Admissions Tests 
by the University of California." The 
UC Board of Admissions and 
Relations with Schools released the 
report in A1arch. 

The B.OAR.S. report stated that 
studies have shown the S.A.T. I poor-
ly predicts college achievement, and 
that high school GPA and S.A.T. n 
scores are more strongly correlated to 
freshman GPA. 

The key difference, according to 
the report, is in the respective values 
of measuring aptitude or achieve-
ment. 

"Achievement exams are more 
suited to measuring mastery of the 
high school curriculum than exams 
designed to measure general intellec-
tual aptirude," the report reads. 

The report stated that the new 
admissions test should reliably mea -
sure mastery of UC requirements and 
be highly predictive of college suc-
cess. 

The test should be distinct from 
the SAT. I such that its creation and 
implementation is justified, as well as 
comparable to the S.A.T.s 1 and II in 
length, the srudy said. 

Another "critical requirement" of 
the report is the ability to translate the 
new test's score into a roughly equiva-
lent score on the SAT. 1 and A.C.T. 
Students applying to UC schools and 
non-UC schools not accepting scores 
from this new test would then not· 
have to take expensive multiple tests. 

COA Chair Julian Betts said these 
three last points - the "genuine new-
ness," the length requirement and the 
ability to produce equivalent scores-
are mutually inconsistent. 

"You could pick any two of these 
three [to implement)," Betts said, "but 
achieving all three is probably impos-
sible."

Mice help fight against 
human bowel disease 

A joint research project between the UCSD 
School of Medicine and two Israeli medical centers 
has resulted in a synthetic form of bacterial DNA that 
may provide hope to those afflicted with inflamma-
tory bowel disease. 

Researchers found that when mice are injected 
with the the man-made bacterial DNA, the symp- . 
toms are reduced. The study's authors hope the 
research will soon be able to help humans. 

Researchers estimate that 1 million Americans 
suffer from lBO, which is associated with the painful 
symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea and rectal 
bleeding. The disease is. prevalent in the industrial-
ized world because samtary and ukra-dean condt-
tions, along with the prevalent use of antibiotics and 
vaccinations, keep many bacteria and pathogens out 
of intestines. As a result when the immune system 
attacks IBD bacteria it also attacks the intestine lining. 
thus causing inflammation. 

UCSD School of Medicine associate professor 
Eyal Rax is the study's senior author. Kenji 
Takabayashi, Tomko Hayishi, Jongdae Lee and 
Lorenzo Leoni, all of ~om are members of the 
UCSD Department of Medicine, also contributed to 
the study. Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem 
and Tel-Aviv Sourasku Medical Center also participat-
ed in the study, which appears in the May 2002 
issue of Gastroenterology.

Former Cesar Chavez partner 
gives lecture to round out month 
Delores Huerta spoke to the audience about farm worker 
issues in a lecture that closed the monthlong celebration 
By REBECCA WOOD 
Senior Staff Writer 

Co-founder of the United 
Farm Workers of America Delores 
Huerta spoke Tuesday at the 
lnstirutc of the Americas to mark 
the end of Cesar Chavez Month. 

Huerta, 69, is the mother of II 
children and travels around the 
country for farm workers' rights, 
women's rights and civil rights 
causes. 

Huerta is the emeritus vice-
president of the United Farm 
Workers. She and Chavet brought 
farm workers' rights national 
attention by transforming a local 
union into a major social and 
political movement. Huerta spoke 
of her organized boycott on 
grapes and lettuce during the 
I 960s. 

Thurgood Marshall College 
student Margarita Sanchez said 
her mother supported the boy-
cott. 

"It was a great opporrunity to 
hear [Huerta) speak," she said. 

"1 became more aware of 
what's going on around us and 
how we can make a difference by 
taking action," said Marshall 
junior Belen Sanchez. 

Huerta said that although 
great srrides have been made, 
there are still undocumented 
workers who are being exploited_ 
She gave examples about Mexican 
farm workers in California's Kern 
County. The county's largest city 
is Bakersfield, Calif. 

, 

This year is the 40th anniver-
sary of the UFW and is the second 
year of official Cesar Chavez Day 
celebrations at UCSD. 

The month's activities includ-
ed lectures by California Supreme 
Court Justice Carlos Moreno, 
professor Antonia Darder of 
Claremont Graduate School, and 
professor Vicki Ruiz of UC 
Irvine. There was also a film pre-
sentation, a pane.1 discussion at 
the Cross Cultural Center, a 
Thurgood A1arshall College cul-
tural celebration, a youth scholar-
ship essay contest, a student field 
trip to Chicano Park and a 
monthlong UCSD Bookstore dis-
play. 

Huerta discussed the impor-
tance of voting and representation 
in poli tics. 

"The.re has been progress, but 
racism still exists in our society," 
she said. 

Huerta is also a member of th.e 
Feminist A1ajority, which she said 
is working to bring attention to 
women's lives in Afghanistan. She 
also discussed domestic issues 
concerning women. 

Huerta noted the importance 
of higher education. 

"Think of a diploma as to how 
can I serve my community," she 
said. 

Huerta spoke about the impor-
tance of government funding to 
community colleges and urged 
students to write letters to Gov. 
Gray Davis. 

"When money to community

colleges is cut, it huns worlcing-
class people," Huerta said. 

Huerta talked about the poli-
tics of globalization and corporate 
exploitation of laborers in Mexico 
and the problems with North 
American Free Trade Agreement 
and jobs going overseas. 

"Profits come out of a country 
and don't stay there," she said. 
"We need a movement for eco-
nomic justice." 

Huerta also discussed the 
young women who work in the 
maquiladoras in Juarez, Mexico, 
where 270 women have allegedly

"The University of California is 
responsible for the development 
and testing of every nuclear weapon 
in the U.S. arsenal," Sunwoo said. 

The University of California 
operates the Lawrence Livermore 
and Los Alamos laboratories for the 
U.S. Department of Energy. Among 
other things, the 12bs research and 
develop nuclear weapons. 

Using the university to conduct 
testing lends academic c.redibility 
to the deployment of weapons of 
mass destruction, Sunwoo said. 

Natha.n Britton, the Southern 
California assistant political direc-
tor for California Peace Action, 
spoke on the larger role of nuclear 

weapons in maintaining a "grossly 
disproportionate distribution of 
resources globally." 

The role of the Univer ity of 
California in nuclear development 
is obscured from srudents, accord -
ing to Britton. He said if it were 
more visible, students and faculty 
would not support the nuclear 
research, and students would be 
less inclined to apply for jobs and 
graduate work in Lawrence 
Livermore and Los Alamos labs . 

A.S. Commissioner of Student 
Advocacy Brie Finegold, one of the 
event's organizers, declined to 
comment. 

Herbert F. York, a fonmer UCSD 
chancellor, was the first head of the 
Lawrence Livermore lab in 1952. 
York initiated lab research that 
included a magnetic fusion program, 
diagnostic weapon experiments, the 
design of thennonuc1ear weapons 
and a basic physics program.

Increase in fines 
will unfairly 
burden students 

T he Tr,1I1sportation ant! Parking 
COl1lmittee has recommended increases in 
permit fees and parking violation fines to cover 
lhe costs tor new parking strucrures. The pro-
posals once again demonstrate that the admin-
lstration is wnvilling to view srudents as any-
thing but cash cows for ~llbsidizing university 
projects. . 

A cursory glance at the proposals may not 
even rankle the average inquisitor, however. 
Starring next ye:1 f, "S" permits would cost an 
addition:!l $4 per month - not an exorbitant 
rise in the g;Jnd cherne of things. Holders of 
"A" and ' B" pennirs - faculty and staff, 
respectively - will foot the bill for parking 
projects through a proportionaJ increase in 
permit prices. 

Such increases are going to help fund the 
construction of new parking structures, 
including one in Revelle College and one near 
RIMAC Arena. Parking facillties are main-
tained without the help of state funds, so 
increases in the cost of parking sernces will 
always be necessary to meet tile demands of 
new parking projects. 

Nevertheless, there is Iitde hope that stu-
dents will acruaUy benefit from the proposed 
fee increases - there is much indication that 
students will be used as warm bodies with 
pocketbooks whose presence on campus is 
only usefuJ insofar as it may help shoulder 
financial burdens. 

The opening of the Gilman Drive and 
Pangea structures has done ,~nuaJly nothing 
to ameliorate the West Campus parking 
conundrum. Swaths of "A" spaces lie vacant in 
the structures at peak demano hours, while "S" 
space areas remam at full capacity. The admin-
istration's major interests are catering to top-
dollar researchers and parking them in "A" 
spots as close as possible to theIr laboratories. 

It would be ludicrous to hope that the con-
struction of a few more parking structures 
every couple of years \vill acruaJly impact the 
quality of student parking, particularly when 
the campus populaoon will jump by more than 
800 new srudents per year. Even with the con-
struction of new structures, "S" pennit holders 
will continue to feel the disparity between ris-
ing permit costs and plummeting parking 
opportwlities on West Campus. 

This is to say nothing of the proposed 
increase in parking violation fines. For parking 
in a marked spot without the proper pernlit, 
the charge would go from $21 to $40. For 
parking 111 an expired meter spot, the penalty 
will culminate in a $35 fine. "A" permJt hold-
ers do not accrue fines such as these; they are 
aimed at srudents who try to park illegally in 
(often available) "A" and "B" spots. These fines 
wi ll shift a great portion of the financial bur-
den for parKing projt~cts onto the shoulders of 
srudents and hapless, illegally parked visitors. 

The difficulty of finding an amicable solu-
tion for UCSD' parking woes should not be 
swept under the rug. Administrators should 
not couch the burden of parking costs within 
broad-based, draconian penalties that uneven-
ly affect srudents, If administrators, faculty and 
staff stand to reap the most benefits from 
improvements to UCSDs parking infrastruc-
ture, then aiming penalties at srudent viola-
tions is unfair and regressive.

For better or for worse, alcohol 
plays a major role at UCSD 

Drinking helps many' students lose their inhibitions 
and feel comfortable among their peers 

8y KIRSTEN HUBBARD 
Staff Writer 

If you look at The Princeton Review's 
ran.lcings for the biggest "party schools," 
UCSD naturally does not make the list. 
Even UC Santa Barbara, the outrageous 
party haven of my high school days, 
barely scratches the list as No. 20. 
UCSD also does not grace the presence 
of the other alcohol-related Top 20 lists, 
"Lots of Hard Liquor" and "Lots of 
Beer." 

Our school has often been character-
ized as rather antisocial. We are scien-
tists, not partygoers, and we have more 
crucial matters to spend our time on, 
such as organic chemistry problems and 
complex engineering equations. 

In truth, to become a part of the 
social ci rcles at UCSD, whether they are 
interest organizations, Greek houses or 
JUSt the tight group of people in a resi-
dential hall suite, alcohol is a central -
and even necessary - part of social 
interaction. 

I have attended parties ranging in size 
from the largest frat extravaganza to the 
most mediocre A.S. Council gathering, 
to the smallest congregation of a few 
close friends. At various times, I have cel-
ebrated every night of the week - and 
alcohol is almost constantly involved. 

The power that alcohol maintains, 
even on this campus, can be illustrated 
by a recent ordeal of mine, one that 
might affect me for years. Over the past 
few months, I have become increasing-
ly aware of a pain in my stomach that 
occurrs after my second or third drink. 
After consuming a couple of shots or 
beers, I was forced to sit still, not mov-
ing for the 10 or so minutes it would 
take for the pain to pass. However, once 
the pain subsided, I would continue 
drinleing, and I would promptly forget. 

One Friday at about 6 a.m., I awoke 
to terrible shooting pains in my st.omach 

and chest. I wondered what was wrong. I 
had drunk the night before, but I hadn't 
been smashed. Yet somehow, those 
drinks were the fabled straw that broke 
the camel's back. 

After a grueling five-hour series of 
hospital tests, including the withdrawal 
of about 12 vials of blood and an ultra-
sound, the doctors couldn't make a defi-
nite diagnosis except for this: Don't 
drink alcohol. Ever. 

As I lay in the hospital bed, I immedi: 
ately visualized my social life wasting 

In truth, to become a part 
of the social circles at

away. Nonetheless, over the nelCt few 
days of recuperation, I had surplus time 
to think on a broader level. 

Many of us have spent sweaty, nause-
ated nights leaning over the toilet and 
have woken on mornings after to spin-
ning rooms and throbbing heads. What 
is it about alcohol that makes us so will-
ing to experience pain for it? AIe those 
few uninhibited hours really worth the 
risk? Maybe there is a loneliness in being 
the only one with inhibitions. 

For example, one of my best friends 
was our designated driver at a fraternity 
boat party a few months back. 

"I couldn't believe how stupid eve.ry-
one looked," she said afterward in 
anguish. "It was so artificial. 1 hope I 

never look like that." 
However, when the next party rolled 

by, her title as sober driver was revoked, 
and so was her cynicism as she joined the 
dnuuen ranlcs. 

When I find myself complaining 
about being a designated driver, I start 
wondering why alcohol is so necessary 
for me - and most everyone who is 
social at UCSD - to have a good time. 

There will always be a student who 
will attempt to argue in the contrary. "( 
have fun," they will say. "I'm social, and 
I party, and I never ever drink." My 
warmest regards to these people, wher-
ever they reside. I have indeed met 
social, straight-edge Trirons . Their 
numbers correlate to the fingers on one 
hand. The more UCSD-sponsored par-' 
ties I attend, the more r admire these 
people and speculate as to where their 
willpower comes from . However, when 
it comes down to it, I have never in my 
time at UCSD heard anyone vocally 
condemn alcohol or those who con-
sume it. 

Curious, I took it upon myself to con-
duct a brief, informal survey as to why 
people drink. Whomever I queried usu-
ally gave me a strange look. The most 
common answer was, "Because drinking 
is fun. " Obviously. 

In a way, I might consider anyone 
who has ever yearned for a drink, or 
more specifically, yearned to get drunk, 
something of an addict. This is some-
what of a harsh statement, yet not so 
extreme upon contemplation. I include 
myself in this categorization. Most of us\ 
however, are not addicted to alcohol 
physically - we're addicted to the feel-
ing. And any sort of addiction is terrify-
ing. 

About a week after my hospital ordeal, 
I volunteered to drive my friends to a 
party, since I wasn't going to be drinking

Echinacea is nature's anti--Viagra 
Springtime elicits musings about 'Mr. Happy' 

basically 
CARRIE ElIZA. BETH S":L:\R 

W ellr it's spring again, and as is 
the case with every 
normal person out 
there, spring makes 
me think of penises. . 

The other day, 1 was talking to 
a friend about my concern that I 
had a sore throat - a conversation 
that I would think should be 
penis-free. 

But 1 was talking to a man, so I 
should have known it was going to 
come up. (fhe topic, not his acrual 
penis' Geez, get your minds out of 
the gu tter, people!) 

So anyway, I've gor a sore 
throat. And I mentioned the bene-
fits of echinacea for just such a 
condition. And this is where it gets 
interesting. 

My friend informed me that 
echinacea makes men impotent. 

Of course, I don't give a rats ass. 
This is because I don't have a penis, 
seeing as how - try to follow my 
logic here - I am not a man. 

So, being the sensitive and car-
ing human being that I am, my 
response was: "So what?" 

Then my friend brought up an 
interesting point: "Well what's the 
point of not feeling sick if Mr. 
Happy isn't gonna be fully func-
tional?" 

Alcohol: 
Most ignore harmful 
effects of drinking

anyway. They swiftly intolCicated 
themselves and rushed to the dance 
floor. I stood there in the middle of 
the dance floor and wondered why 
r was so conscious of myself. 

I am one of the many people to 
claim, "I need alcohol to dance." 
However, I would consider that 
statement too much of an u1till12-
rum. The truth is, alcohol gives us 
the chance to dance in total com-
fort, to flirt in total comfort and 

Seriously - he really said that. 
I know people who are this weird. 

My friend's assertion led me to 
two conclusions: First, men 
should never, rotr use the term 
"Mr. Happy." And second, guys 
really have no idea that the world 
does not revolve around their 
dicks. 

Now, this can be seen through-
out history. Take Galileo, for 
example. Remember him? He was 
the guy who proved that the Earth 
revolved around the sun. And he 
was also imprisoned and shunned 
for his little brealcthrough. 

Why? Because all the other 
guys around said, "What? My 
penis isn 't the center of the uni-
verse) Screw that! Galileo is going 
down'" 

That is why it took so long for 
us to accept our current view of the 
solar system: Because we don't usu-
ally depict the sun as a big phallus. 

Next, take Newton. That apple 
story you hear in science class is a 
load of crap. What really hap-
pened was: Newton was getting it 
on with some lady, and she noticed 
a little problem. 

"Sir Isaac, your manly member 
is failing to erect itself," she said. 

What's a guy to do when he's in 
a pinch like that? Discover gravity, 

' of course! That way he can say, 
"Nay, fair maiden; 'tis just the 
force of the Earth's core, which 
pulls all objects downward. I am 
still a very virile and desirable 
man." 

Problem solved. 
You can even look at the key 

symbols of the United States for 
evidence that everything guys do 
is inspired by how momentous 

even to leiss in tOtal comfort. 
Alcohol is like a transportable self-
bubble. Once you're in it, you forget 
the people around you - what oth-
ers think doesn 't matter anymore. 

That may be, in itself, the reason 
many people drink. Maybe it's why 
I drank, and why 1 still do to this 
day. Three weeks after my stay in 
the hospital, I was drinking again, 
with the help ofTums and my pre-
scription Pepsid pills. Still, I am 
constantly aware of the slight pain 
that lingers in my stomach, even as 
I write this. I hope I've conveyed 
the ambiguity of alcohol use-.

they think their penises are. Case 
in point: the Washington 
Monument. 

Right after the War for 
Independence, when our founding 
fathers needed a symbol of what 
this coun try stood for, they sat 
around and debated it. 

"We need it to look like what 
we've been fighting for," one 
founder said. 

"Right: a symbol for everyone 
to Icnow what our new country 
will value above all else," another 
agreed. 

"Well, we do have that Starue 
of Liberty thing," some poor 
schmuck said. 

"Yeah, and it's throwing people 
off. I mean, it's a starue of a chick." 

"Good lord, men' There are 
no monume'nts to ' our penises 
yet!" 

Well , now you can imagine 
what an uproar the room must 
have been in. 

"1 don't know about you all , 
but that's what I was fighting 
for !" 

"Yeah! I want a building com-
memorating my penis! That's 
what started this country in the 
first place!" 

So they built the Washington 
Monument, and they even put a 
reflecting pool next to it so the 
metaphorical founding penis 
would look even biggtT. And that, 
boys and girls, is how Japanese 
touriSts come to appreciate how 
big American dicks are. 

So basically, I still took echi-

tages. We are children of a DAR.E 
generation, but we are also children 
of a binge-drinking generation, no 
matter how paradoxical the two 
titles seem. We know the hannful 
effects of alcohol on our bodies, yet 
we are able to ignore them - even 
if, as in my case, the effects are bla-
tantly clear and painful. 

The most frightening thing to 
me about that paradox involves 
what I mentioned in the begin-
ning: UCSD is known as an anti-
social school. We are the opposite 
of a party school, as our reputation 
suggests. If this is true, [ can 
scarcely imagine the atmosphere 
and peer pressure at those top 20 
party schools.

Campus atmosphere shelters

There's a bubble over our

barrier that shields this La Jolla 
camr-us from the real world. A little

As a Muslim American, I was 

extremely moved by Jessica 
Lingel's article, "Reactionary par-
ents perpetuate ignorance" (April 
29), in which she spoke out against 
the cancellation of an assembly on 
Islam at her younger sister's mid-
dle school. 

In a post -Sept . II United -
States, where fearful ignorance is 
being formal ized and reali zed -
as in the case of the USA Patriot 
Act and the mass roundup of thou-
sands of American immigrants of 
Ara b and Asian descent - what is 
needed is a return to basic 
American va lues, such as the 
innate equality of peoples and the 
right to an unfettered, uncensored 
education . 

In writing this article, Lingel 
reminds us of what is truly 
American; indeed, she serves as a 
role model not o nly to her 

younger sister, Anna, but to us all. 
I thanlc: her parents for teaching 
her these exceptional values, and I 
thank her for continuing to 
espouse them. 

Lingel, you have done US all a 
great service; thank you.

Letter inaccurately 
portrayed views held 
by organizations 
Editor: 

The April 22 edition of the 
Guardian contained a letter from 
Brian Brook, co-chair of the 
Unified Campus Coalition. That 
letter used my name as an 
endorsement for Brook's own 
views about last year's Anti-
Zionism Week, a private meeting 
held among UCC chairs and the 
presidents of the Union of 
Jewish Students and the Muslim 
Student Association, and current 
fliers circulating on campus 
a bou t Jews a nd the precepts of 
Judaism. 

I write now so people will 
know that in no way do Brook's 
views reflect the opinion of the 
Unified Campus Coalition or my 
own. In fact, none of us had any 
knowledge of Brook's letter until 
we saw it printed in the Guardian. 

The problem is that the letter 
incorrectly assessed my own 
point of view and the view of the 
UCC, breached private issues, 
and unilaterally attacked the 
MSA and its president, Ahmed 
Salem. 

Brook's letter, I fear, did more 
to attack people against whom he 
had grudges than to illustrate 
overall th e views and goals of the 
UCC. While the Unified 
Campus Coal iti on stands for 
respect and understanding, its 

intent is not to alienate one side 
or the other. 

I was shocked when I read 
Brook's illustration of a meeting 
between himself, the presidents 
of UJS and MSA and me, which 
was held over two months ago. 
Brook had no right whatsoever to 
discuss that meeting in any 
respects, nor to unilaterally sin-
gle out the MSA representative 
and make claims about what 

. Brook believed my feelings were 
about the whole occasion_ 

We cannot pretend that the 
conflict in the Middle East is not 
a result of the faults on both sides 
and the fauJt of our own foreign 
policy. 

However, to alienate one 
position and not another, 
whether intentional or not, does 
not and cannot provide the cred-
ibility needed to solve co~flicts 
and abridge differences. 

Only by focusing on the simi-
lari ties between Muslims and 
Jews can respect and understand-
ing hopefully be attained. I am 
afraid that this message was not 
carried in Brook 's letter, despite 
his intentions . The Unified 
Campus Coalition holds no 
political position, because it has 
no right to. 

I myself have felt the pain of 
hate and ignorance, of propagan-
da and plain stupidity. I have also 
been attacked by Jewish individu-
als for being Muslim. 

But the fact that I have been 
attacked does not mC'lln that I 
should condemn my Jewish 
brothers 01" even consider them 
extreme. 

The only way for peace is by 
reaching out to them and mak.ing 
them understand your view with 
as much vigilance as it takes for 
you to understand theirs. I know 
that to shut my ear from these 
voices is a greater harm than to lis-
ten and see where they are coming 
from and understand why. 

This, I believe, is the goal of 
the UCC. I hope more than any-
thing that this message is not lost 
because one of our members felt 
it necessary to pass judgment 
without the virtue of respect and 
understanding.

Graphic unfairly paints 
all catholic priests as 
pedophiles 
Editor. 

The political cartoon in the 
opinion section in the April 25 
edition of the GfUlrdi"n reveals 
your staff as biased and ignorant. 

The implication of the comic 
- that Catholic priests routinely 
engage in or enjoy child pornog-
raphy - is totally unacceptable 
and an insult not only to 
Catholics, but to all those who 
loathe discrimination. 

Defining a whole class of peo-
ple by the crimes of a few is sen-
sational inanity that should be 
avoided at all costs by an organi-
zation that purports to represent 
UCSD. 

Does the Guardilln also con-
done bigotry against Arab-
Americans because of the actions 
of al-Qaeda? Or was the United 
States right to imprison 
Japanese-American citizens 
because Japanese pilots bombed 
Pearl Harbor? 

Of course, the degrees of bias 
are incomparable, but the point 
remains: Any form of labeling or 
stereotyping in our sociery is a 
poison that does not belong any-
where, let alone in an institution 
of higher learning.

concerned with the weather 
than planning the anti -hate 
rally. The pitiful percentage of 
voters in both college and the 
nation serve as a testament to 
the just plain "1 don't care" atti -
tude that is latently detrimental. 
The solution cannot be clearly 
determined either, however. 

From one perspective, it is 
inevitable that collegians are 
somewhat separated from the 
worldly scheme. It is, to an 
extent, up to each student to 
check WWW.cnn.com and see 
what the fuss is a bout, to take 
up responsibility in cook.ing, 
cleaning, and the like, to even-
tually gain a mindset that is 
more than nai've and less than 
unrealistic. 

What perhaps is needed is 
first a realization that our colle-
giate world is drastically differ-
ent from a world rife with polit-
ical, social, economic and per-
sonal problems and situations. 

This awareness would ideal-
ly create a desire to learn more 
about the world in participating 
in activities, checking out the 
news, tak.ing an active role in 
organizations and pursuing 
occupations. It's pretty idealistic 
to assume that doing all th ese 
things will remedy the situation 
and eradicate the invisible for ce 
that separates the campus from 
the complete picture. 

Yet, with an understanding 
that th e world goes beyond 
what is seen in these confi nes, 
students can better prepare 
themselves for what is to come.

lates our fundamental rights to be 
active in the community. It limits us 
because we have no say. We can't be

Steve Klass lobbied against the bill. 
His office brings local issues to a

to branch out from the university, 
according to Klass. 

"But also, in more general terms,

zations on campus and making sure 
they are all connected," he said. 

This year, Klass has served as

would most likely first be taken in

Betts argued that this timeline 
'was not feasible because that would 
give B.O.A.R.S. about three years 
to decide what curriculum the test 
should cover, find a company to

against the bill because of what it 
perceives as a discriminatory 
requirement. UCSD students, par-
ticularly through the A.S. Office of 

II scores and high school GPA to 
"college achievement" measure 
that achievement only through 
freshman year. Betts said COA 
would like to see research involv-
ing second- through fourth-year 
GPAs, GPA at graduation, dropout 
rates, time to degree and whether 
students applied to graduate or 
professional school upon graduat-
ing. 

"COA strongly endorses the 
rationale of having an admissions 
test and the characteristics of ideal 
tests [in the B.O.A.R.S. report] , but 
we have some concerns about tim-
ing and things like that," Betts said . 

B.O.A.R.S. Vice Chair Barbara 
Sawrey was present at the meeting 
and said other schools, including 
California State University, have 
shown interest in the B.O.A.R.S. 
recommendations, and this may 
mean students applying to non-UC 
schools will still only have to take 
one test. 

"We're not going to have sepa-
rate tests," she said. "Very quick! ,

Klass and the external office will

the upcoming gubernatorial election. 

He said that future lobbying for 
electoral reform will now be 
focused at the state level. 

"If anything is going to be done 
on electoral reform rather than on 
standard voter registration drive, it's 
going to be centered around mak-
ing sure that students' voices are 
heard on the state level," Klass said . 

California Sens. Barbara Boxer 
and Diane Feinstein voted for the 
bill. 

we're seeing coalescence with what 
B.O.A.R.S. has presented." 

The A.C.T, she said, is already 
closer to meeting the B.O.A. R.S. 
recommendations than the S.A.T

A.C .T. is discussing with 
B.O.A.R.S . ways to change its test 
to suit the University of Californi,l.

ny behind the SAT, has also

it than minorities, Betts said the 
type of test the University of 
California is considering to replace

"I just don't see how any new

The world-famous Sasha and John Digweed will grace the San Diego Sports Arena 

L
ast fall the dynamic OJ duo of 
Sasha & Digweed came to San 
Diego and spun an incredible 
set at 4th & B. Only Sasha and 

his partner in crime, John Digweed-
or vice versa depending on whose side 
you're on - were on stage with their 
turntables and crates of records. With 
limited visuals and loud, banging 
techno-trance they thrilled the crowd 
into the early hours of the morning. 

The Sasha & Digweed team has 
returned to San Diego but this time 
the DJs hold noth ing back on thei r 
Delta Heavy tour. 

on Global Underground have been 
popular with his most recent release 
inspired by his set in Los Angeles. 
This more business-minded half of 
the duo also runs a record label, 
Bedrock, and is featured as the 
Music Supervisor for two films due 
for release this spring. 

"!t's been ages since I played in 
the States," S:lsha states. "I am very 
excited about coming back and see-
ing everyone again." 

A specially designed set will sur-
round the duo while the incredible 
Phazon Sound System pumps out 
the beats. There will also be custom-
designed visual s and interactive 
lighting that will respond to the 
crowd and the music.

The man behind the plan is 
American DJ and booking agent 
Jimmy Van M, who founded the 
Balance Promote Group. His com-
pilation, "Trance Nation America," 
released by Ministry of Sound, is one 
of their best sellers. Jimmy Van M 
was among the people who helped 
develop and organi ze the Delta 
H eavy concept, and he is the open-
ing OJ. 

"We're nor selling these nights 
based on hype," Van M states. "It's 
more like us going back to our roots. 
This tour has an organic feel to it." 

Today 

Thi Isn't twO DJs spinning a set

This is two DJs acting like they 
are rock stars in a country that hasn't 
embraced dance music like Europe 
has. In fact, most DJs don't go on 
tour with their OWll immense sound 
systems and massive sets with expen-
sive lighting - until the Delta 
Heavy tour. 

Sasha & Digweed made a name 
for themselves with compilations 
such as, "Renaissa nce: The Mix 
Collection," and their ethereal 
"Northern Exposure" series, which 
featured trancey breakbeats and 
seamless musical flows . They also 
hold the distinction of being the first 
British DJs to have a residency in the 
United States at New York City 
super-club Twilo, which was shut 
down due to accusations that the 
club was operating without the 
proper permits. 

Sasha has been voted No. I OJ of 
the year by various electronic music 
publications and has remixed the 
likes of Madonna , The Chemical 

Brothers and has produced music 
for video games. His "Xpander EP" 
has been incredibly popular and mix 
CDs released by Global 
Underground have cemented his 
place in the progressive house 
world. Behind the decks, Sasha is 
known for his long sea mless mixes, 
which beautifully blend music 
together. 

John Digweed has also been mak-
ing a name for himself. His recent 
popularity has rivaled that of morc 
established acts such as Paul Van 
Dyk and Paul Oakcnfold. Digwecd's 
si ngle "Heaven Scent" was a massive

Poet Quincy Troupe reflects upon on his experiences 
The California poet laureate finalist talks about teaching at UCSD and meeting Sartre 
By JESSICA KRUSKAMP 
Senior Staff Writer 

Writer, poet and UCSD litera-ture professor Quincy Troupe earned yet another 
• accolade in his field by being 

named a finalist for the California 
poet laureate. 

This nomination is only one of 
many awards in Troupe's notable 
carcer . 

Troupe, 62, has a resume that is 
internationally renowned. A recipi-
ent of two American Book Awards, a 
1991 Peabody Award, numerous 
lifetime achievement awards, 
National Endowment of the Arts 
Awards and a New York State 
Council for the Arts Award, he con-
tinues to generate illustrations work . 

The California Arts Council 
notified Troupe near the end of 
March that he had been selected as 
a poet laureate finalist among 55 
nomi nees. The other finalists for 
the first official state poet laureate 
are beat poet Diane Di Prima and. 

Francisco X. Alarcon, who is com-
mended fo r his English and 
Spanish prose. 

"Even if it is me, someone is not 
going to be selected, so you have 
elation and you have regret, " 
Troupe said. "It was not something 
that I auditioned for; Di Prima I 
know real well, and I know Alarcon, 
and everybody can't be the one." 

The two-year title has been 
awarded five times si nce 1915, but 
this is the first year the appoint-
ment is being officially selected by 
the state. The recipient of the post 
will tour his or her poetry statewide 
to leaders and citizens, spreading 
the wri tten art. 

He describes himself as low-key 
but energetic. Troupe acknowl-
edges that he has a "presence" 
when he walks into a room. 

"My students know of my 
career, but they take my class 
because I am a good teacher," he 
said . "I don't think of what I have ' 
done. Alan Ginsburg told me that 
we both really needed to catch our-

selves and not let anything in our 
career affect our demeanor." 

Troupe wants to help his stu-
dents develop a sense of themselves 
through their personal work and 
diverse selections of poetry. In his 
course, students write, read and cri-
tique great writers. 

"I am addicted to great writing, 
and I want my students to be aware 
of those in our world," he said. "I 
knew when I came here that this 
was a science school, but I want to 
give the students the opportunity at 
grea t stuff in this field." 

Troupe cites the length of class-
es as a problem at UCSp. He feels 
tha t although it is not a popular 
view, literature cannot be taught 
welJ in a 50-minute discussion. 

"Poetry and - literattlfe can 
change people and students, and I 
want them to change in a positive 
way," he said. "That is my job." 

However, Troupe's job used to 
be sports. A basketball career in 
high school and college led him to 
the hardwood in Europe. Being a 

member of several all-leag\le Army, 
French and European teams earned 
him sports fame as well as debilitat-
ing knee injuries. 

After the third and final blow-
out in the 1960s, Troupe turned to 
writing when he was in his twen-
ties. 

"I never thought I was going to 
be a poet; nor did I think that I was 
going to be a college professor," 
Troupe said. "My mother read poet-
ry to me on Saturdays when I was 
young and I hated her for that; 
everybody in the neighborhood was 
laughing at me because poetry was 
considered ladies' work to my ath-
lete friends, which is totally untrue." 

Troupe's first work was a "terri-
bly bad novel" about an exiled 
African-American in Paris. He 
penned it when a knee injuty kept 
him sidelined from his Parisian ba -
ketball team. Through friends he 
met philosopher and writer Jean-
Paul Sartre, with whom Troupe 
was not impressed. 

"I did not know at the time who 

he was - he was a beady-eyed guy 
who told me first that he hated 
pocts, but that I should write poct-
ry," Troupe said. "He lold lIle that I 
should get control of the words and 
I should always ca rry a notebook, 
and to this day I sti ll do." 

\Vhatever runs through 
Troupe's mind at :lIly point in the 
day, he reaches into a black ;houl-
cler bag bought spCCllically for hi, 
notebook and jOts it down . I Ie 
thinks in phrases and hnes of what 
could be a larger work. I iundrcd, 
of these notebooks have been lilled. 

Once he controlled Ills words and 
found a vein through which to ch,ln-
nel his energy, Troupe moved fmlll 
France to back to the United States. 
In Lo Angeles he worked as a jour-
nalist. I Ie then began to teach \Hlt-
ing. 

Touring the n;ltion doing poetry 
readings and lecture on Afnc;lI1-
American literature, Troupe beg,lIl 
to be recognized by major uni\,ersl-

Skateboarders rise to prominence 
JDogtown and Z-boys' documents youth culture 
By MARA EVANS 
Staff Writer 

S katebo:trders and their dare-devil srunts are a common sighr now, bur a per on flying 
over pavement on wheels still 
shocked onlookers not too long 
:Igo. Once considered a passing 
craze along with hula hoops and 
yo-yos, it wasn't unril the 1970s 
that the pastime became a highly 
technical and inllovative craze. 

Stacy Peralta's award-winning 
documentary, "Dogrown and Z-
boys," traces the emergence of 
skateboarding from its roots in 
SOlHhern California to its com-
mercial popularity. 

Dogtown, the local nickname 
for Venice, Ocean Park and south-
ern anta" lonica, Calif., served 
as the birthplace for modern skat-
ing. ""'hile Dogtown was primari-
ly a place for surfing, its younger 
generation found additional solace 
in the resurrected sport of the 
1960s: skateboarding. 

[n the early 19705, Peralta, 
along wiLh J ay Adams, Tony Alva, 
\Ventzle Ruml and a diverse group 
of youngsters sought refuge in the

Jeff Ho & Zephyr Surf Shop. As a 
result, th e rag-tag team became the 
Z-boys who found themselves skat-
ing playgrounds, empty swimming 
pools during a drought and eventu-
ally winning skating competitions. 
"Dogtown and Z-boys" is a chron-
icle of their escapades. 

Peralta amasses a montage of 

images that captures not only the 
energy of ti1e athletes but also the 
hard times that gave way to skate-
boarding as we know it. Most of 
the original Z-boys are also on 
hand to give witty, insightful com-
ments on their creation.

Sir Paul McCartney will grace 
Southern California region 
The former Beatie stops in Los Angeles and 
Anaheim on his hard Driving USA tour 
By JOSEPH LEE 
Hiatus Editor 

After President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963 , The Beatles were con-
~idered one of the main forces that 
helped heal the nation with their 
infectious nmes, charisma and wit. 

Decades later, former Beatie Sir 
Paul McCartney is poised to help 
heal a nation again in the aftermath 
of Sept. 11 with his first tour in 
almost 10 years. In his tour, 
McCartney also pays tribute to his 
longtime friend and bandmate, 
George Harrison, who passed away 
late last year. Armed with a healthy 
selection of classic Beatles tunes 
and ~ome hits from his solo years, 
McCartney's Driving USA tour 
should prove to be one of the 
hottest and most emotional tours of 
the year. 

McCartney also rcleased his 
fLrst studio album in four years with 
"Driving Rain." In those studio ses-
sions, McCartney recorded at a 

Beatles-like pace by finishing the 
album in about five weeks, com-
pared to some bands who take )'ears 
to release material. H e a.\ so redis-
covered himself as simply a bass 
player - playing his distinctive 
Hofner bass, of cou rse. 

"Talking about ti,e old way The 
Beatles used to record brought that 
back to me," McCartney states. "So 
although I 've played a bit of guitar 
and stuff on the occasional track, 
I've basically been a bass player. 
That's my role. It's simple and sat-
isfying -1 si ng and J play bass.» 

'vVhen it rains McCartney, it 
pours. 

McCartney penned the title 
song for ti,e movie "Vanilla Sky" 
and recently released the si ngle 
"Freedom" with sales bencfitil1g the 
families of the victims of ept. 11 . 
He performed "Freedom" for the 
pre-game show of ti,e Super Bowl. 
McCartney was also part of the 
benefit concert for ew York City.

Not another wide release of DVDs 
'Not Another Teen Movie' arrives on video in a special edition 

Hillcrest dessert restaurant delivers various 
mouth-watering dishes from cake to torte 
By MARA EVANS 
Staff Writer 

Tucked away in an obscure sec-tion of Hillcrest hides a culinary treasure that will sa tisfy even 
the IT!0st finicky cater. Extraordinary 
Desserts is no more and no less than 
its name: simply fantastic. 

The ambiance of the bakery 
revolves around a renovated bun-
ga low. As customers approach the 
entrance covered by an old-style 
Hollywood canopy, one almost 
expects paparazzi bulbs to pop. 

The interior decor of Japanese 
and African cultures is a perplexing 
combination, but tastefully under-
stated. Seating varies from small 
window-seat tables to a more tradi-
tional coffee house arrangement. 

While mementos from the 
respective regions are for sale, the 
customers' focus falls squarely on 
the dessert cases at the bakery'S 
entrance. 

Each recipe is a creation of 
owner Karen Krasne, who has been 
classically trained at world-
renowned French culinary schools 
such as Le Cordon Bleu and Ecole 
LeN6tre. Frequent trips to France 
and elsewhere around the world 
contribute to Krasne's recipes and 
resul t in a vast array of flavors. 

Le Bete Noi r is a true trea t for 
any chocolate lover, with its layers 
of dark chocolate cake covering ' 
chocolate mousse and creme brulee. 

For those with a delicate 
palette, the Fraisier Triple-Berry 

Torte packs a soft berry punch for 
sensitive taste buds. Extraordinary 
Desserts goes far beyond the tradi-
tional' using ricotta cheese in some 
recipes and even making tiramisu 
with chocolate cake. 

The focus of each dessert, how-
ever, is not only taste but also 
appearance. Each dessert is a sculp-
ture, decorated with a selection of 
fresh fruit, flowers, gold leaf or 
roasted nuts. A choice of house cof-

. fees and teas are also available, and' 
a simple glass of milk will appear 
upon request. Holding true to 
style, even the sugar crystals for the 
hot beverages are decadent. 

'vVhile potential guests should 
expect a long line during the late 
hours of the evening, the service is 
fast and efficient. Be warned that 
like the desserts, the prices are not 
for the faint of heart. 

Extraordinary Desserts is guar-
anteed to be a unique experience, 
either for a first date or close gath-
ering of friends. It is not unusual to 
have a love-hate relationship with a 
piece of chocolate cake, but at 
Exrraordinary Desserts, its all right 
to wave the white flag and succumb.

With its grotesque deluges into shock comedy and ubiquitous display of scant-
ily clad women, "Not Another 
Teen Movie," which parodies the 
teen movie genre, is quite the 
opposite of its namesake. 

However, unlike the recent 
deluge of flicks aimed at a younger 
and stupider demographic, a 
sparkle of cynical intelligence 
shines from this movie's toilet 
humor, making its burlesque 
scenes, which are many in num-
ber, funny and not just shoclcingly 
sexual or disgusting. 

Fortunately, the DVD of the 
movie shows the same sparkle. 
The 18 included deleted scenes are 
without a doubt the highlight of 
the DVD. Since the movie is basi-
cally a sequence of scenes strung 
together by a very thin plot, 
watching all 18 is like watching 
another 20 minutes of the movie. 

The "unrated" presentation of 
Marilyn Manson's "Tainted Love" 
music video is also particularly 
horrible - in that good kind of

ties across the nation. Aher work

was publishing poetry and litera-
ture. The publicity machine was 

@I----REV-~~-D 
way. Manson, however, does go a 
bit over the line in some Qf his 
behind-the-scenes comments. 

Finally, for the teen movie ini-
tiated, the makers of the DVD 
included a handy teen movie fac-
toids track that points out all satir-
ical references to teen movies. 

All in all, boasting not only a 
decent flick but also a plethora of 
special features, this DVD is a 
welcome addition on any teen 
movie fan 's shelf. 

'Ali' 
Muhammad Ali may have been 

the undisputed heavyweight box-
. ing champ of the world, but the 

DVD of "Ali" - the movie that 
chronicles his life - is an ultra 
lightweight loser in the arena of 
DVD entertainment. 

Without a single respectable 
special feature, the "Ali" DVD is 
reminiscent of DVDs at the 
beginning of the digital video rev-

moving faster and faster. 
"Fame can be an albarross if 

you let it be - what is important 
to me is to do good work with my 
writing and my students. Fame is 
fleeting because history is replete 
with people who were famous then 
it was taken away. Fame cannot be 
taken seriously," Troupe said. 

Following 20 years in New 
York, Troupe turned down a pro-

olution. Way back then, it was 
excusable ro drain consumers' 
pocketbooks solely in the name of 
enhanced video and sound qual ity. 
Now, this practice is the DVD 
equivalent to sacrilege . 

The DVD partially makes up 
for its total depravity of extra con-
tent with its admirable sound and 
video fidelity. The video clarity 
easily handles the minute cine-
matographic details that charac-
terize director Michael Mann's 
style in "Ali ." The slightly yellow 
tint engulfing scenes that take 
place in the .'60s, for instance, is 
captured beautifully by the video 
track. 

Nevertheless, the current 
DVD market is saturated with 
discs tha t offer equal picture and 
sound quality, sport a respectable 
set of special features, and most 
importantly, include a better 
movie. As such, the "Ali" DVD 
stands out solely in its sub-medi-
ocrity and only belongs in the col-
lection of a DVD fan who, for 
some reason, really, really loves 
the movie.

The Black Eyed Peas 

Photos by Chris 
Padfield 

Hip-hop: The ecletic stylings of The Black Eyed Peas graced the Jenny Craig Pavilion at the Universtiy 
of San Diego on April 27. The Los Angeles based hip-hop group also incorporates elements of jungle 
and trip-hop. Their most recent album, "Bridging the Gap,' features production work from DJ Premier 
and Wyclef Jean . 

Paul: 
The Driving USA tour will feature 
many classic tunes from The Beatles 
Continued from page 10 

The creativity of McCartney isn't 
restricted to pop music. Under the pseudo-
nym Fireman, the pop legend has released 
ambient-techno albums. But the releases 
are not readily available and may require a 
bit of hunting to acquire a copy. 

The Driving USA tour has already 
garnered very positive responses, espe-
cially with a Beatles-heavy setlist. 
Compared to previous tours, there seem 
to be more selections from The BeatIes' 
self-titled release better known as the 
"white album." 

Since Phish is taking a break from tour-
ing, you won't be hearing any live versions 
of Beatles songs anytime soon. You never 
know when Sir Paul is heading back to the 
United States, so break open the piggy-
bank and go see a living legend who can 
sti ll sing well and listen to some classic 
tunes that The BeatIes never had the 
chance to play live. 

If all you Beatles fans don't go, you 
might be missing one of the greatest per-
formances of your life. 

Paul McCartney will be performing at

There is no doubt that these kings of the

ers as they have for years.

The Apes 
The Fugue in the Fog 

French Kiss 

* Fugue, n .: An imitative, 
polyphonic composition in 
which a theme or themes 
are sta ted successively in 
all of the voices of the con-
trapuntal structure. 

The Apes' use of the 
word fugue is almost as 
distorted as everything else 
of on their first full-length 
album. A more appropriate 
and easily understood title 
could have gone some-
thing like: "Marilyn 
Manson at a Carnival With 
a Stomachache." 

Rather than pushing 
the edge of experimental 
music by doing things that 
have never been done_ 
before, The Apes take the 
very worst from the very 
best and make it their very 
own. Harsh and indistin-
guishable lyrics drown in a 
dark void of heavy guitar 

and an even heavier elec-
tric organ (complete with 
distortion) throughout the 
album. 

The I\pcs perform their 
I1IU~Il: wllh J complete ths-
regard for the notion that 
~omeone llIay have to lis-
ten to it someday - per-
haps the way aernal apes 
really would, had they the 
ability to play music. 

If one thing can be said 
of them, it is that they stay 
true to their name. It is a 
name that they are truly 
proud of, since four of 
their album 's song titles 
contain the word "ape." 
They even announce on 
their third track that "the 
apes are going to turn it on 
now," and screaming 
ensues. 

While the apes turn it 
on, the audience is only 
encouraged to turn it off 
by the harsh German whis-
pers that linger in the back 

. of their speakers' cone. 
For those looking for 

the newest tangent of 
mirth in music, The Apes 
may be the best out there, 
but for those who are look-
ing for music to 'actually 
listen ro, a much better bet 
would be any other mem-
ber of the primate family: 
either The Monkees or 
Gorillaz.

Peter Murphy 
Dust 

Metropolis 

** While Peter Murphy's 
latest album, "Dust," is cer-
tainly original, it leaves 
much to be desired. 
Though Murphy d~bes 
his latest effort as "part 
Trance, part a1t-prog-rock. 
parr classical, part pop," the 
album actually tries to 
please everyone and ends up 
pleasing very few. 

Classical and Turkish 
music are both prevalent 
throughout the album, but 
while both styles of music 
are beautifully' composed 
and performed, the two are 
not well-combined; instead 
of complementing each 
other, they tend to clash. 
The final effect is like trying 
to watch television with the 
radio playing, which 
detracts from what could be 
nine very beautiful pieces of 
music. 

• reviews 
Even more distracting 

than the poorly arranged 
music are the lyrics. In some 
of the pieces, including 
"Things to Remember," 
which opens the album, dlC 
lyrics are spoken rather than 
sung. The result gives the 
Impression of a recorded 
poetry reading rather than a 
musical album. 

Even when the lyrics 
are sung, they don't sound 
as serious as they're sup-
posed to. And with lyrics 
such as "With every move 
nowl I'm the mover with 
the groove now" from 
'J ust For Love," some of 
the songs are almost comi-
cal. 

However, some of the 
songs do have some rather 
interesting lyrics. 
"Things to Remember" 
opens with the somewhat 
thought-provoking lyrics, 
"Things to remember 
when writing figures of 
speech and soundl The 
power of poetry comes 
from the ability to defy 
logic. " 

Overall, "Dust" is a 
unictue album with an 
interesting sound, even if it 
is somewhat flawed. Bm if 
this kind of music appe.als 
ro you, Peter Murphy will 
be here in San Diego on 
May 26, so you can hear 
him live.

Various Artists 
Verve Remixed 

Verve 

***** Grab 12 records from 
the world-famous jazz 
label Verve Records and 
toss it in a stainless-steel 
shalter with 12 of the best 
electronic music produc-
ers. Shalc.e well, pour into 
your ears and you get 
"Verve Remixed." 

The album is filled with 
classic jazz tunes from the 
likes of Billie Holiday, Ella 
Fitzgerald, Astrud 
Gilberto and Shirley 
Horn. They were respect-
fully remixed by producers 
MJ Cole, the Thievery 
Corporation, Rae & 
Christian, and Tricky. 

The concept behind 
"Verve Remixed" took 
three years to develop 
while the right producers 
were selected to remix the 
best jazz records. 

The result is familiar 

jazz tunes via slick produc-
tions with deep, lush 
sounds. 

Dinah Washington's 
classic nine "Is You Is or Is 
You Ain't My Baby?" was 
remixed by Manchester 
duo Rae & Christian. 
They drop deep bass 
grooves along with a sim-
ple trombone melody 
underneath 'vVashington's 
sultry vocals. 

UK garage special ist 
MJ Cole drops a sexy twO-
step bea t to Carmen 
McRae's "How Long Has 
This Been Going On?" 
The signature pizzicato 
melody adds a modern and 
upbeat motion to thi s 
rune. 

Masters At Work 
remixed Simone's "See-
Line Woman." MAW said 
they have always been big 
fans of Simone and sec 
Simone's song as "ahead of 
its time." Their respect for 
Simone shows in their pro-
duction. MAW preserves 
some ' of the warm analog 
tones of the original 
recording with slight uses 
of digital production. 

For fans of" j32.Z and 
electronic music, this is 
the perfect combinati on 
that pays homage to old 
classics with a great deal of 
respect.

DW: 
Columbia rolls out a new 
digital edition of ~eny Maguire' 
Continued from page 10 

'Jerry Maguire' 
Featuring one of the best 

romantic comedies to hit theaters 
in the past 10 years and packing 
hours of extra content, the "J erry 
Maguire Special Edition DVD" 
two-disc set is sure to have the 
movie's producers crying "Show 
me the money!" 

With the DVD's unusually 
pristine video quality, fans of 
"J erry Maguire" can watch more 
closely as Jerry, a prominent 
sportS agent played by Tom 
Cruise, recovers from a job-losing 
breakdown to find the love of 
both his personal and profession-
allife. 

More importantly, child star 
Jonathon Lipnicki's smiles appear 
even more adorably cute in DVD 
quality. Also, entirely new audi-
ences will be able to lavish in 
Lipnicki's show-stealing perfor-
mance - the DVD features an 
expansive set of subtitled lan-
guages, including Chinese and 
Thai. 

The music video for Bruce 
Springsteen's "Secret Garden," 
the movie's theme song, is anoth-
er of the DVD's highlights. In the 
video, which is almost as romantic 
as the movie itself, The Boss 
shows he can be just as sentimen-
ral as Cruise . 

Moreover, the usually ho-hum 
DVlJ audio commenrarv is made 
special by the appearance of every 
one of the movie' stars - Cruise. 
Renee Zellweger and Cuba 
Gooding Jr. - as well as the 
movie 's director, Cameron 
Crowe. 

To top it off, among other 
text-based special features, the 
D\ 1) includes the full text of 
jerry's mission starement/memo 
that is so crucial to the film's plot. 
True ':Jerry Maguire" fans will 
find this to be a godsend; less

why on Earth somebody rook the 
time to wrire all 20-plus pages of 
the manuscript.

Dogtown: 
Documentary chronicles the 
rise of skateboarding 
Continued from page 10 

Initially, "Dogtown" comes on 
strong. The stuttering zooms into 
still shots and the rapid movement 
of the sti lis across the screen leads 
to a lack of focus. The style is vivid, 
disorienting and ultimately empha-
sizes the speed with which the z-
boys created their genre of sport. 

The enthusiasm of the Z-boys 
also surfaces through interviews. 

"I was on summer vacation for 
about 20 years," Ruml says at one 
point. This exuberance is echoed 
by all the Z-boys, but Peralta also 
makes sure to represent the sudden 
rise to fame that most members of 
the group experienced in a truthful 
light. 

"Dogtown and Z-boys" is nOI 
your average Jocumentary - nOI 
only in presentation, but also in 
content. 

Hardcore skaters will be 
impressed by the original mastery 
of dry wimrning pool walls by the 
Z-boys, as well as the invention of 
the more difficult ae rial moves. 
The hisrory of Southern 
California, the skating culture, and 
even the emergence of such lingo 
as "grind," "carve" and "barrel" 
will ~a ri s fy even an audience of non 
skater . Reg.lrdless of your affilia-
tion wi th a skateboard or lack 
thereof, "Dogtown and Z-Boys" 
will leJve you stoked.

Jansen racking up wins for women's tennis 
Sophomore has a combined 40-4 singles and doubles record this year for UCSD 
By COREY HOLMAN 
Staff Writer 

UCSD's recrultlng power 
increased dramatically two years ago 
with its move to National Collegiate 
Athletic Association's Division 
II. Two years later, the womens ten-
nis team is reaping the benefits with 
a core lineup of four sophomores -
one of whom is Kristina Jansen -
who has particularly helped the 
Tritons become one of the most 
dominant teams in the nation with 
depth seen in few other programs. 

Jansen, a creative writing major 
at Eleanor Roosevelt College, has 
amassed a 40-4 record, combining 
singles and doubles this season to 
help the Tritons to a 20-3 record 
with a perfect 8-0 mark in CCAA 
play. 

However, it's not just her record 
that makes Jansen special; it's the 
way she plays. 

"Kristina never gives up,ft said 
women's tennis head coach Liz 
LaPlante. "She gives it her all on 
every point." 

This toughness is evident when 

Polo: 
Tritons lose two seniors, 
have a horde of returners 
Continued from page 20 
halftime the score was 3-3. However, 
UCSD suffered a major blow when 
T ocker was ejected from the game 
after receiving a four-meter penalty 
and two ejections. llis proved fatal 
for the Tritons. 

"[Losing Tucker] was a psycho-
logical blow," Kudritzki said. "We 

one takes a close look at her singles 
play. Jansen is 21-1, playing most of 
her matches in the No. 5 singles 
spot. Instead of letting up against 
admittedly weaker opponents, 
Jansen has dominated, dropping 
only five sets total and losing only 
15 points in her seven completed 
CCAA matches. 

Playing in the No. 5 spot can be 
tough for a player of Jansen's cal-
iber, and it has its shortcomings. 

"Playing against weaker oppo-
nents at No.5, even though you win 
most of the matches, doesn't really 
help my confidence," Jansen said. "I 
go into the matches against the big-
ger teams and wonder if I can play 
with those girls. But because our 
team is so strong, I get a lot of prac-
tice against good players every day." 

A lack of big-time matches did-
n't hurt Jansen when the Tritons 
moved .into the final portion of the 
season - definitely their most dif-
ficult stretch of matches. 

"Though she's played some easy 
matches," LaPlante said, "she has 
played well against the tough oppo-
nents_" 

were not prepared for it and I thin!< 
that gave [Loyola Marymount] 
some momentum." 

The Lions stymied the Tritons 
by only allowing one goal in the 
entire second half. LMU picked up 
its offensive play with some impres-
sive long shots on the goal and was 
able to take the lead and hold onto 
it. The Tritons also missed a few 
opportunities to get back into the 
game by failing to convert on sev-
eral man-advantage situations. 

Even with Kudritzki's three-
goal effort, UCSD was not able to 

The results speak for them-
selves. Jansen won her singles 
matches when UCSD faced fourth-
ranlced Barry University, No. 13 
Cal Poly Pomona, No. 16 UC 
Davis, No. 18 Grand Canyon 
University (twice), No. 28 Sonoma 
State University and No. 40 
University of Northern Colorado. 
jansen's only loss was against No_ 7 
Abilene Christian University, drop-
ping a three-set match to Rachael 
Taylor. 

Jansen doesn't let up when she 
teams with freshman Jasmin Dao. 
The duo has collected a 19-3 record 
at No. 3 doubles, including a per-
fect regular season in the CCAA. 

"She's a strong competitor," 
Dao said. "She never gives lip and 
that's what you need in a doubles 
partner. She's always so perky and 
upbeat, and that helps a lot." 

Dao and jansen's play comple-
ment each other well, which is why 
such a young team has been able to 
achieve such incredihle results. 

. "Jasmin and Kristina are a real 
solid No. 3 team," LaPlante 
said. "They've both been worlcing 

overcome LMU and was defeated 
8-4 to end the season. 

Sanders reflected the bitter-
sweet feeling the team felt after 
corning so close to the Final FoUT_ 

"We just had a letdown in the 
second half," he said. "I'm glad that 
we at least placed ourselves in the 
position to reach our goal, but we 
unfortunately couldn't get there." 

Kudritzki seemed a little more 
optimistic about the result. 

"Even though we lost, it was great 
to have an opportunity to win the 
[WWPA Championship]," she said. 

on coming to the net and both have 
good ground strokes. ft 

But Jansen's talents are more 
than just athletic; she provides a 
source of inspiration on and off the 
court to an incredibly tight squad. 

"She's always in a great mood," 
LaPlante said. "Sometimes things like 
midterms and schoolwork can affect 
some of the girls, hut it never affects 
Kristina. She always comes ready to 
practice in an upbeat mood." 

Dao agreed with her coach. 
"She was so friendly when I first 

got here," Dao said. "She made me 
feel so welcome on the team." 

Jansen's relationship with Dao 
gained extra importance when they 
became doubles partners. 

"Jasmin is stilileaming every day," 
LaPlante said, "so a lot of times it was 
up to Kristina to carry the team." 

Jansen's upbeat attitude and tal-
ent on the couct will be needed this 
weekend when the Tritons host the 
NCAA Western Regionals at 
UCSD's North Tennis Courts. 

The Tritons will first face 
Hawaii-Hilo on Friday at 2 p.m. The 
winner will play to advance to the 

After the tournament, several 
Tritons were honored with AlI-
WWPA selections. Both Tucker 
and Kudritzki earned first-team 
selections, Hemmerly landed on 
the second-team and junior Samara 
Silverman r~ceived an honorable 
mention. 

With the season finished and her 
playing career virtually done, 
Kudritzki reflected back on the great 
year she and her teammates had. 

"We had some really big wins that 
should bring some respect to our 
program," she said. "Ths is some-

Tritons win in bottom of 9th 
Baseball beats Redlands to improve to 27-21-1 
By COURTNEY FIELD 
Staff Writer 

UCSD beat the University of 
Redlands Bulldogs on tuesday 
when Triton catcher Matt 
Kennison si ngled home shortstop 
Keith Hernandez in the bottom of 
the ninth. 

The Tritons wasted no time 
jumping on the Bulldogs, scoring 
two runs in the bottom of the first 
inning - the first time UCSD 
has scored more than one run in 
the first inning in 12 games. 

UCSD 's offense strung 
together three hits in the inning 
to earn a 2-0 advantage. Triton 
left fielder John Bologna led off 
the inning with a single to left, 
followed by a single by right 
fielder Tyler Sullivan. UCSD 
first baseman Chad Addison then 
singled to center and drove in 
Bologna and Sullivan on the play. 

Redlands halved the lead in the 
top of the third inning when 
Bulldog center fielder Jake 
Bernhard and shortstop James 
Cordes both singled to left field. 
Left fielder Chris Grant grounded 
out to second base but scored 
Bernhard on the sacrifice. 

Both tearns scored twice in the 
fourth inning. 

For Redlands, third baseman 
Mike Karg scored off a double to 
right-center field by right fielder 
Sam Kristensen. Kristensen pro-
ceeded to score the second run of 
the inning for the Bulldogs off a 
single by Bernhard to put the 
University of Redlands ahead by 
one. 

Triton designated hitter 
Garret Riddle singled to center 
field in the bottom of the inning, 
stole second and then scored 
when second baseman Anthony 
Lococo smacked a rwo-run home' 
run to left field - his third on the 
year. UCSD center fielder David 
Hawk also doubled in the inning. 

UCSD's rWI in the fifth came 
courtesy of heads-up baseball by 
Sullivan. Mter doubling down the 
left field line, he tagged up and 
advanced to third, and then pro-
ceeded to score on a wild pitch by 
Bulldog hurler Steve Gormley. 

Redlands put up three runs in 
the sixth. Designated hitter Ryan 
Beglin and pinch runner Aaron 
Holley scored unearned runs in the

inning: Beglin originally reaching 
on an error and Holley scoring on 
a wild pitch. Bernhard also scored. 

"Today's [game] was played 
very poorly on our part," Addison 
said. "We may have won the 
game, but we didn't playas well as 
we are capable of." 

In the eighth inning, Triton 
catcher Jeff Riddle doubled to 
right field . 

Brandon Walker pinch-ran 
and scored when Lococo came 
through in the clutch with a rwo-

the playoffs are looking 

good as long as we 
play our game.'

out single, driving in Walker to tie 
the game. Kennison's bases-
loaded single ended the game in 
the ninth . . 

Senior Robert Pee lIe picked up 
the win - his first of the season 
- by throwing rwo innings of 
scoreless relief for UCSD. Raf 
Bergstrom, Tommy Sereno and 
Alex Cremidan also pitched. 
University of Redlands closing 
pitcher Craig Cartmill took th.e 
loss, falling to 4-7. 

Lococo went 2-for-2 with 
three RBIs, a walk and a run 
scored for UCSD. Sullivan 
added three hits, a double, rwo 
runs scored and rwo stolen bases. 

on top for the Bulldogs were 
Bernhard with three hits, one 
RBI and two runs scored, and 
Cordes and Karg who had rwo 
hits each. 

With the win, UCSD 
improves to 27-21-1 overall while 
Redlands drops to \3 -25. 

The Tritons travel to Davis, 
Calif., for a critical four-game 
California Collegiate Athletic 
rusociation series with UC Davis 
this weelcend . The series will 
determine whether UCSD will 
finish in the top four in the con-
ference and qualify for the play-
offs held in Chico, Calif., starting 
May 9. 

"The chances of making the 
playoffs are looking good as long 
as we play our game," Addison 
said. "As a senior, I couldn't have 
asked for a better oppohunity in 
my final season. All of us seniors 
are very excited to be able to put 
it all on the line and see what 

happens. This team definitely has 
the talent to do well this last 
weekend and to make an impact in 
the playoff picture. II 

Riddle agreed, and noted the 
intensity of this weekend's match-
up. 

~We're stolced to play Davis," 
Riddle said. "We've got some-
thing to play for in the la$t series 
and that's what it's all about, [but] 
we'll take it one game at a time." 

Addison agreed. 
"We have been working our 

butts off for over six months, and 
it is awesome that it all comes 
down to the final weekend of the 
year," Addison said. 

Softball: 
UCSD loses to Western 
New Mexico in finals 
Continued from page 20 
When the Gators struck with three 
runs in the bottom of the third, 
UCSD found itself in an unfamiliar 
place against a San Francisco State 
team it had beaten soundly in each 
of the teams' two prior meetings. 

Clawing rneir way back into the 
game, the Tritons scored'a run in 
the fourth and rwo runs in the fifth 
inning to tie the game. Pitcher 
Christi Martinelli kept the Gators 
from any further scoring and the 
game headed into extra innings. In 
the eighth inning, UCSD finally 
asserted itself as the better team, ' 
pushing across four runs and hold-
ing off a late Gator charge to win 
7-4. 

Afterward, Triton head coach 
Patti Gerckens stressed that her 
team had been lucky to escape with 
a win. 

"We let many opportunities 
pass us by that game," she said. 
"We had our backs up against the 
wall and we are very fortuna te that 
we came back." 

The tournament was far from 
over for the Tritons, however, 
because Saturday's first game 
brought in the West Region's top-
ranked team: Western New Mexico 
University. UCSD could muster 
only rwo hits against Mustang ace 
Angela Slaugh, and the Tritons 
gave up rwo more unearned runs 
when they lost 4-1. 

The loss dropped UCSD to 1-2 
on the tournament and set up yet 
another crucial game, this one 
against Hawaii-Hilo. This time, 
freshman Keri Hanley pitched four 
solid innings, allowing only one 
run for the 3-1 win. The Tritons 
got all the offense they needed 
from a three-run, fourth-inning 
outburst. 

Harlan continued her strong 
performance with three perfect 
innings in relief, and later praised 
the Triton pitching staff for its 
work throughout the tournament. 

"ru a staff, it was a really 
impressive weekend," Harlan said. 

Despite their inconsistency in 
the first four games, the Tritons 
still found themselves in a good 
position Sunday with a single-
elimination date in the brackets 
with Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
The tearns squared off for the sixth 
time this season and the second 
time of the weekend with UCSD 
looking to avenge the earlier loss 

THURSDAY, MAY 2, 2002 

in pool play. In order to be suc-
cessful, the Tritons wanted to for-
mulate a better game plan against 
the Toros. 

"I think we just came [into the 
weekend] expecting to win all of 
our games and we weren't really 
focused ," said UCSD left fielder 
Kristina Anderson. "We changed 
our focus and we broke down what 
[Cal State Domingucz Hills does] 
and what we needed to do to stop 
them." 

Gerckens said that plan 
involved shutting down the Toro 
bunts and minimizing errors. The 
Tritons executed the game plan 
well, and Michelle Leisen's second-
inning RBI brought Samantha 
Hayes home to give UCSD all the 
scoring it needed to hold onto a 1-
o win. Hanley and Martinelli com-
bined on a seven-hit shutout and 
propelled UCSD into the tourna-
ment semifinals. 

In their second of three rematch 
games on Sunday, the Tritons rode 
Martinelli's stellar pitching, and 
scored a timely run in extra innings 
to top Hawaii-Hilo 2-1 and 
advance to the final against 
Western New Mexico. 

In the last game of the tourna-
ment, the Mustangs reminded 
everyone why they are the class of 
the conference. Martinelli pitched 
her third game of,the day and was 
slightly less sharp than in the first 
two; giving up three runs in four 
innings - more than enough for 
Western New Mexico's Slaugh, 
who gave up just five hits en route 
to a 5-1 win. . 

Despite the loss in the final, the 
Tritons were pleased with their 
performance. 

"I would say that during pool 
play we didn't play anywhere near 
our potential, but when it was sink 
or swim, we starting swimming," 
Gerckens said. "We're in a good 
place, but we have to finish strong. 
Right now we should be peaking, 
and in a lot of ways I think we 
are." 

UCSD goes confidently into its 
final weekend in conference with 
doubleheaders against San 
Francisco State University and 
Sonoma State University on May 3 
and May 4. 

"Out of the weekend we got 
momentum pushing us toward the 
rest of our regular season am:l'post-
season," Mettee said . 

UCSD will need all the 
momentum it can get as it heads 
down the stretch and fights for the 
sixth and final berth in the West 
Regional tournament to be held 
May 11 and May 12.

Revamped varsity open-four boat takes gold 
Romelfanger, Gray, Watters, Jones and Patton lead Tritons past UCLA and USD 
By CARRIE ELIZABETH SKLAR 
Senior Staff Writer 

In preparation for the Western 
Intercollegiate Rowing rusociation 
Championships this weekend, the 
women's crew took on the top 
schools in Southern California last 
weekend in the Miller Cup Regatta 
in Marina Del Rey, Calif. 

To give the top athletes in her 
program the best experience, head 
coach Pattie Pinkerton combined 
the top lightweight and open row-
ers in the varsity open-four boat. 
Living up to the expectations set 
for them, coxswain Claire 
Romelfanger and rowers Emily 
Gray, Jen Watters, Liz Jones and 
Sara Patton - the only heavy-
weight rower - came in first to 
bring home a gold metal. 

Musings: 
Cricket doesn't conform 
to American ideals 
Continued from page 20 
spin that I have seen men wrap 
around themselves with the swing 
and then get hit in the back with 
the ball - those are thieves, or 
properly, spin bowlers. 

Others bring it in so fast and 
accurately on the bounce that they 
can fit the ball in a half-inch crack 
berween the batsmen's hands and 
his body to take the wiclcet - those 
are bloodhounds, or pace bowlers. 

There are no gloves, and the 
ball is harder than a baseball. Men 
will play three feet from the bats-
men to get on top of the play. The 
wicket keeper gets no pads or little 
old-school mitts for protection, 

"I wanted to give the elements 
of our lighrweight crew some key 
race experience," Pinkerton said. 

The boat finished in 8:48, to 
seconds faster than second-place 
finisher UCLA and 23 seconds 
ahead of third-place finisher 
University of San Diego, both of 
which are heavyweight crews. 

Pinkerton said the win over 
those Division I heavyweight 
boats was even more impressive 
because of the day's weather con-
ditions. 

"They did that against a head-
wind, which should have benefited 
a heavier crew," she said. 

Pinkerton was also impressed 
with the varsity open-four crew 
because of its "very consistent per-
fonnance" last weekend; the boat 
won its qualifying round in 8:47 to 

and the bowler can legally throw at 
the head of the batsmen three times 
- on the bounce, of course. 

While a baseball player has about 
a 90 degree an~le to work with, a 
batsmen can take the ball anywhere 
on the field he wants to. The best 
batsman in cricket today is a man tit-
de more than five feet tall: Sachin 
Tendulkar. There are very few things 
as satisfying in sports as watching this 
little bit of a man snap those light-
ning quick wrists for a boundary. 

Runs are scored on almost every 
bowl in cricket- a far cry from the 
drawn-out opus th.at is a Tampa 
Bay Devil Rays baseball game. 

With all this going for it, why 
has cricket not become a sport that 
people attempt in America? There 
are probably many problems with 
cricket's assimilation into the main-
stream, but the main problem with 
cricket is the Englishness of it. It 

beat Loyola Marymount University 
and UC lrvine, respectively - a 
one-second difference from its final 

'I wanted to give the 
elements of our 

lightweight crew some 
key race experience.'

winning time later that day. 
According to Pinkerton, the 

coxing job by Romelfanger left her 
even more satisfied' with the team. 

"The rowers told me the 

reeks of private school V-neck 
sweaters with stripes on them, peo-
ple with titles and persnickety little 
boys named Laurence and Charles. 

Let me you give you a persOhal 
example to illustrate what I mean. I 
played cricket for a while when I 
lived in South Mrica. I have a 
decent arm and caught on with 3 
team as a pace bowler. It was a fac-
ulty team, filled with a bunch of 
British South Africans, but faculty 
means anyone who wants to play 
criclcet at the university can play. 
It's like a club team here. 

1 was practicing b~rting one day. 
It is all about edges and angles in 
criclcet versus solid contact in base-
ball. I had been humming the balls 
out of the cage when one of the 
guys told me it was against cricket 
protocol, hitting the balls out like 
that. I stopped doing it. 

After my turn was done, I

coxswain did a great job," 
Pinkerton said. 

Another impressive finish in the 
Miller Cup came from the novice 
open four boat,- which won the 
petite final over Loyola 
Marymount in 9:25 . 

The boa t was comprised of 
coxswain Kim Robbins, nd rowers 
Sarah Tyler, Natalie Seitz, Amanda 
Milligan and Amber Martin. 

The varsity open-eight boat fin-
ished with a final time of7:59, hav-
ing come from behind to beat 
Chapman by 19 seconds. The crew 
finished in seventh place. 

The lighrweight eight boat did 
not compete last weekend but will 
participate in the WlRA 
Championships this weekend. 

Pinkerton said that as a whole, 
the women's crew did a very 

approached the guy and said, "No 
offense meant by hitting balls out 
of the cage like that." I was trying 
to be polite, seeing that this was 
their field and their sport. 

In the driest voice possible he 
said, "All right, and I won't take 
offense to you calling it a cage." 

Only a person with that Brit 
persona can crack one like that so 
deadpan and make it so on the 
money. The thing was, even 
though the guy was trying to make 
a joice out of it, there was an under-
tone of hardness to his jest, of 
obeying what is proper: the rules of 
conduct that govern the game. 

George Orwell - who was 
English - said in "Raffles and Miss 
Blandish," that cricket "gives 
expression to a well-marked trait in 
the English character, the tendency 
to value ' fonn' or 'style' more high-
ly than success. n 

impressive job at the Miller Clip 
competition. 

"The crews are a little bit shaky 
beca use they haven't raced for 
three weeks," she said. "Bur they 
did very well.". 

Part of that praise stems from 
the boats' overall fini shing time~. 

" It looks like our speed is pick-
ing up," Pinkerton said . 

The main goal of the team last 
weekend was not so milch to 
improve its speed, but to prepare 
for the WIRA Championships this 
Saturday and Sunday. 

Pinkerton said she expects 
medals from all of the boat that 
will be competing, but that the var-
sity open-four and novi ce open-
four boats will be the "key players" 
judging from their performances 
last weekend. 

Now, Orwell was saying this to 
make a point about the criminal 
values of the protagonist of;1 book 
he was writing about, but all the 
sa me, I think the point lends itself 
to my argumcnt. 

Cricket doesn't sound 
American. Style over success? I low 
could cricket ever work here? 

Look at our sports: football, 
baseball and basketball - all riddled 
with individual stars. Style is created 
through success for America 's sports 
heroes; it is not a precursor to suc-
cess. Do you think Ben Wallace's 
style was hopping around tllC coun-
try before he was the Defensive 
Player of the Year in the NBA' 

So until something changes, 
cricket shall always remain a two-
cylinder Fiat on America's eight-
lane sporting interstate. 

And for crying out loud, tllCY 
take tea breaks in this sport. 

Yeah, the craziness of midterms can get you down. But think about Cinco de Mayo ... you know, the food, the 
music, the CUlture, the fun? Get out and enjoy the festivities!

Softball 2nd at Mt. Dew Classic 
Sixth-ranked Tritons pick up play at right time 

lniller's

After getting off to a slow start 
in pool play at the Mountain Dew ' 
Classic in Bakersfield, Calif., the 
UCSD softba ll team roared back 
on the tournament's final day to 
ea rn a second-place finish . 

The low point of the nine-
team tournament came quickly for 
the Tritons when they dropped 
their opening game to California 
Collegiate Athl etic Association 
rival Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
The Toros could muster only five 
hits off UCSD starter Leea 
Harlan, but with the help of four 
Triton errors, Cal State 
Domi nguez Hills was given four 
unearned runs and won 6-1. 

At the plate, Harlan was the 
only T riton who could solve Toros 
starter Patrina Smith. Harlan's 
two hits were the only ones Smith 
surrendered in the complete-game 
win. 

UCS D had littl e chance to 
recover from its opening game 
bumblings with a game later that 
day against another CCAA oppo-
nent: the Gators of San Franci co 
State University. As has been the 
case many times recenciy, UCSD 
found itself in a must-win itua-
tion. 

Despite a wealth of hits, 
including five from sophomore 
third baseman Amy Mcnee, the 
Tritons were held score less 
through the first three innings.

Classic tournament in Bakersfield, Calif., last weekend to grab second place. 

O'f all the things that America 
has appropriated as 
its own from 
Guevarra to Pele - it 
has never made an 
effort to take cricket. 

Many other sports like cricket 
have become popular in the states 
and then retained a following. 
Rugby has a loyal fan-base here, as 
does soccer. One of my friends' dad 
belongs to a curling team, and if 
that can happen, why not cricket? 

It's not as if it doesn't have the 
makings of a good sporting event. 

Matches last for upward of five 
days, batsmen drive in 100 runs on 
a good day, and it is not unprece-
dented for teams to score over 700 
runs if they are swinging the bats 
well and keeping the ball away 
from the stumps. 

On the reverse side, some 
bowlers can fire it in faster than 
Randy Johnson and they are allowed 
and are supposed to bounce the ball 
into and away from the batsmen. 
There is almost three feet of hori -
zontal movement on some pitche , 
and anywhere from six inches to six 
feet of vertical movement. 

There are two types of bowlers: 
thieves and bloodholll1ds. 

Some throw the ball with such a
