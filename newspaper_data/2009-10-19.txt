Open since Fall Quarter 2008, the Loft — Price Center’s music, culture and art space — is still without a permanent source of fund-
ing. Administrators are hoping that a new University 
Centers programming fee will provide the venue with 
the revenue necessary to continuing operation.

The referendum, which would redefine the 
University Centers charter to allow use of the depart-
ment’s funding for events programming, is currently 

being considered by the University 
Events Advisory Board and will be 
discussed by the A.S. Council. 

If approved by the council, the stu-
dent body would vote for or against 
funding the Loft in a referendum later 
this year.

University Events Office Director 
Marty Wollesen and university spokes-
man Paul Terzino said that without a 
permanent funding source, the Loft may 

have to lay off student employees, host fewer events 
and begin charging students for concerts at the door.

A.S. President Utsav Gupta said that under the 
proposed programming fee initiative, University 
Centers would continue to be in charge of the Loft. 
Gupta said the proposal is still in its early stages of 
discussion, and he has not yet formed a stance on 
the initiative.

Currently, the Loft is running on funds from mul-
tiple sources, including the University Events Office, 

Venue administrators hope to 
raise student fees in an effort to 
attain stable funding source.

Participants in Ellen DeGeneres’ 
Twitter Challenge looted Price 
Center on Oct. 15 for a chance to 
win tickets to DeGeneres’ “12 Days 
of Giveaways” show.

The challenge, which was a sca-
vanger hunt, required participants 
to produce corn products and red 
towels as quickly as they could.

Another former employ-
ee of the UCSD Parking and 
Transportation department has 
claimed that UCSD utilizes an 
illegal quota system by requir-
ing officers to issue a minimum 

amount of parking tickets per 
day. 

Carole Rains, former assis-
tant director of Medical 
Transportation and Parking at 
the UCSD Medical Center in 
Hillcrest, said that in July 2006 
she was instructed by Director 
of Parking and Transportation 
Brian D’Autremont to double 
and triple the number of cita-
tions her staff of three officers 
were giving out.

She said the department 
would print out sheets compar-
ing the number of tickets each 

officer had given out and dis-
tribute the comparisons to the 
officers pressuring them to issue 
more citations.

D’Autremont admitted to 
posting these numbers, but 
denied setting a quota.

“It’s a real simple equation,” 
he said. “You go out and write 
citations for what’s illegal ... I 
don’t even want to get involved in 
it. I check in once every month.”

Raines said that the system 
encouraged officers to write fab-
ricated tickets.

“It depends on a myriad of 

factors that change every day,” 
she said. “It’s impossible to set 
an arbitrary number. At least one 
officer was saying ‘I’m going to 
write however many tickets they 
tell me to write — I don’t care if 
they’re good or bad.’ Once the 
officer gives the ticket, he’s done. 
He doesn’t have to deal with 
appeals. It’s a major ethics issue.” 

Raines, who worked for the 
department for 28 years and 
consistently received outstand-
ing evaluations, left her posi-

Without a student fee, campus administrators say the Loft may have to 
offer fewer events and charge students an entrance fee.

This caused students to steal from 
several Price Center restaurants.

The challenge was announced at 
8:33 a.m. on Oct. 15 with a Tweet 
from DeGeneres that read: “If you 
know what UCSD stands for, then 
you should probably be looking out 
for my tweets…”

The challenge officially began 
when Degeneres tweeted that the 
first person to bring any type of 
corn product to Aaron Pinkston, 
DeGeneres’s field producer, would 
be in the running to win a prize.

“There was a giant crowd out-
side at [Price Center],” ERC College 
sophomore Gilbert Tercerro said. 
“Then someone said something on 
stage, and then people just started 
rushing inside and going every-
where. It was crazy.”

Some participants resorted 
to stealing corn products such as 
Pirate’s Booty from Price Center 
locations, including Jamba Juice and 
the Sunshine Market.

“People were running in and 
stealing things on, apparently, a 

scavenger hunt for this show, and 
running out without paying,” UCSD 
Police Officer G. Williams said. “On 
top of that there are people stripping 
down to their underwear 
in the food court where 
people are eating. OK? 
We’re at a point where 
this is beyond acceptable 
and it is disrupting the 
university.”

The looting also 
caused other discour-
aged students to leave 
the event.

“When people start-
ed stealing, I just left, 
because you can’t com-
pete with that — and I 
just thought it was lame,” 
Revelle College sopho-
more Amber Frauhiger 
said.

The winners of the 
corn challenge were 
brought to the second 
floor of Price Center, where they 
were instructed to take a picture 
of themselves wearing only a red 

towel and posing with someone in a 
uniform — all in under 15 minutes.

“As the second round began, 
we bolted away, and I overheard 

someone say that 
UCSD catering had 
red towels,” Warren 
College senior Michael 
Kirkpatrick, a winner 
from the event, said. 
“I ran to catering and 
found a very nice man-
ager who directed me 
to a red tablecloth. I 
was then able to take 
a photo with someone 
from Jamba Juice to 
qualify as a person in 
uniform.”

Students who 
expected DeGeneres at 
the event were disap-
pointed.

“I went to the event 
because I wanted to 
see Ellen DeGeneres,” 

Frauhiger said. “I’m not going to lie. 
She’s hilarious. At that point [when 
I found out Ellen wasn’t going to be 

there], I didn’t really care anymore. 
I was like ‘If she’s not here I don’t 
want to be here.’”

Other contestants enjoyed play-
ing the game despite DeGeneres’ 
absence.

“For me it was a very exciting 
event,” Kirkpatrick said. “It was a 
blast running around Price Center 
and seeing the enthusiasm of the 
other students. I spoke to Ellen’s 
film crew and had the advantage of 
knowing that she was not attend-
ing. But not knowing wouldn’t have 
changed my decision to attend the 
event.”

Five finalists, including 
Kirkpatrick, were awarded with tick-
ets to Degeneres’ show and a trip to 
Los Angeles.

“It was incredible to see the 
amount of people in Price Center 
with their enthusiasm,” Kirkpatrick 
said. 

The competition is slated to air 
Monday at 3 p.m on KNSD.

It’s official — UCSD is one of the 
country’s 26 greenest universities. 

The College Sustainability 
Report Card, an organization that 
rates college sustainability levels 
annually, recently gave UCSD an 
‘A-’ — the highest grade awarded in 
the nation — on its Oct. 8 “Green 
Report Card.”

Of the five UC campuses sur-
veyed — UC Berkeley, UC Davis, 
UCLA, UC Merced and UCSD — 
UCSD received the highest overall 
grade.

The goal of the Green Report 
Card project is to showcase uni-
versities that excel in sustainability, 
according to the organization’s Web 
site, www.greenreportcard.org. 

The site ranked each school in nine 
categories — such as transportation 
and recycling — with a letter grade, 
adding up to an overall averaged score. 

This is the second year UCSD 
has been evaluated by Green Report 
Card. Last year, the campus received 
a ‘B+.’ UCSD bumped its score up 
to an ‘A-’ by raising its Food and 
Recycling sub-grade from a ‘B’ to 
an ‘A.’

The dining hall's use of fair trade 
products — items purchased at a 
price fair to exporters in developing 

countries — and organic foods fac-
tored into the grade increase. UCSD 
Housing and Hospitality purchases 
fair trade coffee, chocolate, sugar 
and tea.

“We have been planning with 
the administration to get our uni-
versity to be the second college in 
the nation to receive 
fair trade certification,” 
Sixth College senior Fran 
Avendano said. 

Avendano is a co-
founder of the Student 
Sustainabilty Collective.

UCSD will open a 
Sustainability Resource 
Center next month, 
funded by $150,000 in 
student fees allocated by  
an Associated Students 
referendum that passed 
last year. 

“We're a coalition of 
student groups on cam-
pus working on these 
issues such as compost, 
transportation and fair 
trade,” Avendano said. 
“It's a new trend of sus-
tainability on campus. 
Before our efforts were 
very disunified, but now our efforts 
are centralizing and we have this 
center that will really accelerate sus-
tainability efforts from now on.”

Other areas in which the campus 
excelled included Climate Change 
and Energy, Administration and 
Transportation. 

UCSD is striving to achieve a zero 
carbon footprint by 2020 by focus-
ing on projects aimed at reducing 

energy consumption and increas-
ing energy efficiency. UCSD also 
utilizes hybrid vehicles throughout 
campus and encourages carpooling.

Categories where the cam-
pus scored lower include Green 
Building, Endowment Transparency 
and Investment Priorities, which 

received a ‘B,’ ‘B’ and ‘C,’ 
respectively.

While UCSD does 
employ certain green 
practices in its buildings 
— such as utilizing low-
flow sinks, toilets and 
showerheads throughout 
the campus — it only 
has two buildings that 
hold up to the standards 
of Leadership in Energy 
and Environmental 
Design, an organization 
established by the U.S. 
Green Building Council 
to set standards for green 
buildings.

“I certainly think 
that for us to truly work 
towards reversing and 
finding solutions to cli-
mate change we need 
to work on everything,” 

Campus Sustainability Coordinator 
Maggie Souder said. “That being 
said, I think we're definitely doing 
better with green buildings now and 
I think we're going to keep improv-
ing. The university is working on 
becoming more transparent with 
the investments as well.”

Readers can contact Ayelet Bitton at 
arbitton@ucsd.edu.

Fair trade and organic 
produce help raise 
UCSD’s sustainability 
rating from ‘B+’ to ‘A-.’

“It’s a new 
trend of 
sustainability 
on campus. 
Before, our 
efforts were 
very 
disuniﬁed, 
but now our 
efforts are 
centralizing.”

tion in 2006 due to health issues. She said 
the department began putting 
increased pressure on officers 
to give out more citations after 
D’Autremont became director in 
2006. 

An e-mail that D’Autremont 
sent to Raines on Dec. 16, 2005 
suggested that a particular offi-
cer was not giving out enough 
tickets and stated the average 
number of tickets given out by 
an officer per day. The e-mail 
instructed Raines to never call 
the system a quota. 

“There were snarky com-
ments that put subtle, yet overt, 
pressure on these people,” 
Raines said. “Things like ‘Your 
numbers are looking low’ or 
‘You better watch out…’. These 
guys have families to support. They will do 
anything to please the boss, to keep their jobs.”

Raine’s claims follow similar allegations 

made earlier this month by former parking 
enforcement officer Kenneth Brennan.

Brennan said he was asked 
by his supervisor, Marty 
Greenawalt, to raise the num-
ber of tickets he was giving 
out under an unofficial quota 
system. 

He said that parking 
enforcement officers were 
forced to give out citations for 
parking infractions that they 
would usually only issue warn-
ings for. 

Both Raines and Brennan 
said that current employees 
are too afraid of losing their 
jobs to confirm or deny these 
allegations.

Three UCSD parking enforce-
ment officers contacted for this 
story refused to comment.

Part One:  If God does not exist, you should not believe in Him.  
But if He does, you would be foolish not to, because you would 

not be living your life with a frame of reference that corresponds to 
Reality.  There is certainly a battle, rather, a full-scale war, against 

God, particularly in secular universities, but also in the media and 
entertainment industries, books, music, and in the courthouses across America.  
The bottom line issue in America’s Cultural War is not about politics or 
economics or moral preferences – these are just symptomatic battlefields of 
the real war which is this:  Shall We Believe in God?

Underlying the natural, social, and political sciences being taught in our public 
secondary schools and universities today is the unproven assumption that 
there is no God.  The scientific methodology examines the natural world to 
discover and cooperate with its laws, hopefully for the improvement of life on 
the earth.  There is nothing inherent in the methods of science that requires an 
antitheist (against God) philosophical bias.  Both theists (those who believe in 
God) and antitheists can and do use the same methodology.  The theist sees 
the hand of God in creating and sustaining the universe, the antitheist does 
not.  Fine.  But what is not fine is the biased philosophy of naturalism that 
presupposes without evidence that there is no God.  The evidence for 
Intelligent Design, and thus an Intelligent Designer, is overwhelming, far more 
convincing that the antitheist Darwinian philosophy taught as fact in our 
university classrooms.  And yet, will the Theory of Intelligent Design get a fair 
hearing?

Likewise, there is nothing inherent in the methodologies of anthropology that 
should require one to be antitheist.  One can be committed to objectivity as 
one studies the worldviews, values, mores, and religions of various cultures, 
whether the researchers believe in God or not.  Yet many absolutize the 
methodology and become cultural relativists, and therefore antitheists.  The 
bias against God is enormous.  Antitheism is one of the most central facets of 
political correctness, and woe to the ambitious professor or student that does 
not bow the knee and pay homage.

What is behind this aggressive antitheism?  Why such a war against God?  
Antitheist bias is certainly not required by the evidence.   So what gives?  
Perhaps the antitheist writer Aldous Huxley (1894-1963), author of Brave New 
World, has the best answer.  In his book Ends and Means, he writes:

“I had motives for not wanting the world to have a meaning; consequently I 
assumed that it had none, and was able without any difficulty to find satisfying 
reasons for this assumption.  Most ignorance is vincible ignorance.  We don’t 
know because we don’t want to know.  It is our will that decides how and upon 
what subjects we shall use our intelligence.  Those who detect no meaning in 
the world generally do so because for one reason or another, it suits their books 
that the world should be meaningless.” (p. 270, italics mine).

Later in the same book Huxley is more specific in revealing the reasons behind 
his antitheist and amoral bias.

“For myself, as, no doubt, for most of my contemporaries, the philosophy of 
meaninglessness was essentially an instrument of liberation.  The liberation we 
desired was simultaneously liberation from a certain political and economic 
system and liberation from a certain system of morality.  We objected to the 
morality because it interfered with our sexual freedom; we objected to the 
political and economic system because it was unjust”  (p.223, italics mine).

Huxley’s admission should be embarrassing to those academicians and 
students today who find themselves opting for antitheist and amoral 
philosophies, not because the evidence calls for it, but because of their own 
sexual and political biases.  So much for intellectual and moral integrity.

the Student Affairs Cluster and the Registration 
Fee Committee. Although these departments 
have been supportive so far, they won’t be able 
to fund the venue permanently, according to 
Wollesen.

The Registration Fee Committee has pro-
vided enough funding to support two staff 
positions and to purchase lighting and audio 
equipment. However, these funds are not 
enough to pay for the Loft’s events. 

Additionally, Vice Chancellor of Student 
Affairs Penny Rue granted the Loft one-time 
funding that will last for three quarters, but 
can’t provide on-going support. 

Receiving funding from student fees would 
be the most reliable ongoing source of support 
for the Loft, said Wollesen.

“A proposal to establish a modest student 
fee would be the most reliable source of the 
needed [funds] to bring quality performers to 
the Loft several nights a week with no admis-
sion charge to students,” Wollesen said. 

Ideally, Wollesen would like to see Loft 
events sponsored by a combination of funds 
from University Centers — totalling $30,000 
a year — and student fees. Additional funds 
would be derived from a restaurant that 
Wollesen plans to open at the venue. 

Last year, the Loft’s financial troubles led 
Wollesen to ask the A.S. Council to put a 
$2.62-per-quarter Loft fee referendum on the 
spring ballot for students to vote on. However, 
due to concerns about student oversight, the 
council refused to put the issue before the 
student body.

The fee referendum that is currently under 

consideration is similar, except the money 
would go directly to the Loft instead of being 
channeled through the A.S. Council. 

Former A.S. President Donna Bean had 
described the Loft’s business methods as “fis-
cally irresponsible.” When asked about Bean’s 
comment, Gupta said her concern could have 
stemmed from the fact that the Loft’s numer-
ous funding sources make it unclear as to what 
higher body the Loft should report. 

However, Wollensen sees benefits in the 
Loft’s business model, describing it as “… very 
sound [because it] … relies not just on one 
source of support, but multiple sources.” 

Though the Loft could technically run an 
independent referendum, it is unlikely that it 
would pass, Gupta said. 

Traditionally, most student fee referenda 
are introduced through the A.S. Council.  
According to Gupta, if a proposal has to go 
through the administration, there are more 
points at which it could fail because of all the 
different levels of bureaucracy. Students are 
more likely to vote on referenda supported by 
the A.S. council, Gupta said. 

However, in the most recent report from 
the Registration Fee Advisory Committee, the 
committee listed the Loft as one of the highest 
funding priorities. 

According to the report, which offers fund-
ing recommendations for the 2009-2010 fiscal 
year, an item of “highest priority” means that 
it “ … should be insulated from any budget 
reductions.”

Usually, when midterm week hits, I’m one of the many Perks lurkers burrowed 
into a chair with a hot cup of cof-
fee, earphones and a pile of books. 
Occasionally, I even find myself a part 
of the unshaven chain-smoker contin-
gent lining Geisel’s walkway.

But this year seems to be my year 
of change. I finally quit smoking ,and 
I’ve even made an effort to eat right 
(for the most part).

Good food is, after all, fundamen-
tal to good mental health — but when 
midterms roll around, it’s also impor-
tant to indulge a little.

So, with that in mind, I decided 
to skip the late-night BK run and 
try my hand at baking: one dish to 
sustain me for a few meals during 
the week, and another for a sweet 
post-cram reward. The objective: a 
baked pasta casserole and a batch of 
red-velvet cupcakes. Estimated cook-
ing time: about an hour total, each 
dish requiring 15 to 20 minutes of 
preparation.

Baked casserole seemed easy 
enough, considering I was already a 
seasoned veteran in the art of water-
boiling. First, I added a pinch of salt 
and threw some whole-wheat pasta 
shells in the pan (one hopes, by his 
second year of off-campus living, he 
knows how to make pasta). Beyond 
that, all I had to do was chop up a yel-
low onion, two garlic cloves and four 
cups of spinach, zest two lemons and 
saute everything together in olive oil. 

With an irrational  sense of control 
over the kitchen, I reached for my 
sauteed onions — and was painfully 
humbled by a burn to the forearm as 
I absentmindedly brushed against the 
cooking pot. In retrospect, the pain 
was negligible and short-lived, but it 
was more a blow to my confidence, as 
I’d somehow managed to sustain an 
injury before zesting my first lemon. 

Fortunately, it 
was my only culi-
nary injury of the 
day. From there, I 
mixed my sauteed 
produce with the 
pasta, added the 
lemon zest (finally), 
sliced almonds for 

extra zing and crunch, and slowly 
poured the mixture into a baking pan 
— afterward adding a layer of moz-
zarella on top. 

Once I had sat through 30 minutes 
of baking time at 375 degrees, part one 
of my baking mission was complete.

In all honesty, the crunchy fruits 
of my labor weren’t so great at first 
— though adding alfredo sauce and 
bacon the next day made the casserole 
infinitely tastier.  

I can confidently say, however, 
that part two of my mission — baking 
the red-velvet cupcakes — was one of 
the most rewarding endeavors I have 
taken on in my short life. It’s entirely 
possible that the fulfillment I got out 
of baking these cupcakes will blos-
som into a full-fledged love affair with 
homemade deserts. It was so easy, and 
so worth it.

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA — The UC Board of Regents 
recently proposed a fee hike separate from the 32-percent one that 
everyone’s so up in arms over — and this time, they’re not reaching 
into everyone’s pockets at once.

A $900 tuition hike for upper-division engineering and business 
students is being discussed as yet another way to close the budget 
shortfall. Though the proposal was shelved for further study last 
week, university officials said the plan could still very likely resur-

face. And with student fees already set to rise an appalling $2,514 
next year, the additional increases would amount to more than the 
average student can bear. 

Tying tuition rates to majors is a novel concept for us UC kids, 
but about half of all public universities across the country charge 
more for certain academic programs. In 2007, for instance, the

The University of California is in its deepest crisis in half a century and every mem-
ber of the UC community feels the 
blow.You, the students, are espe-
cially affected, as you will see your 
tuition rise, your classes grow, wait 
lists expand, courses disappear, the 
quality of your education suffer and 
the prestige of your UC diploma 
slip. 

But everyone is affected, from 
staff and faculty to the administra-
tion. We are in this together. 

What went wrong? Is it that the 
UC system failed and now needs 
shock therapy to mend its ways? 
Hardly. The UC system is not per-
fect, but it has been a spectacular 
success — an engine of economic 
growth and social equality. The UC 

system is considered among the 
best universities in the world and 
just this year, two of its current fac-
ulty and three of its alumni received 
Nobel Prizes. 

Is it that the UC system is like 
a carriage-maker whose product 
is excellent, but in low demand 
because barely anyone travels by 
horse and buggy? President Yudof 
suggested as much in a recent inter-
view, arguing that as our 
country grows older there 
is less demand for higher 
education. This may be 
true elsewhere, but not 
in California. Our state 
is not expecting a signifi-
cant drop in college-age 
students anytime soon. 

Moreover, in 
California only one in 
four young people go to 
four-year colleges and 
universities compared 
to one in two Indiana or 
Massachusetts. In fact, 
only two states do more 
poorly than us. 

So why is the legislature tak-
ing away money from something 
that works and is in high demand? 
Where has our money gone? One 
part of it has gone to healthcare 
where costs are running amok. If 
you want to save the UC system, 

fight for healthcare reform. Another 
part of our money has gone to the 
prison system. In 1977 there were 
20,000 prisoners in California. 
Today, thanks to the war on drugs, 
mandatory sentencing and three-
strikes laws, that number has sky-
rocketed to 173,000. Even though 
prison conditions are appalling, 
the state spends five times more 
on an inmate than it does on your 

education, and the aver-
age prison guard in 
California makes twice as 
much as a guard in Texas.

What can be done? 
There are three options. 

The first is priva-
tization. That would 
shift most of the cost 
of higher education to 
you, the students. In a 
fully privatized model, 
tuition would have to 
rise to $27,000 to return 
UC funding to normal 
levels. We can reduce this 
enormous increase by 
drawing on other private 

revenue sources, but each has its 
price and they would not bring in 
enough money to spare you from a 
still-large fee increase. 

The second option is a 30-per-
cent cut in enrollment. The cut 
would make up for how much less 

money the UC system is currently 
getting from Sacramento. 

This would be a disaster. 
California’s already abysmal college-
going rate would fall even further, 
depriving 15,000 students each year 
of a UC education. Either solution 
will have a devastating effect on 
access and diversity. If we do noth-
ing, some combination of these two 
options is going to happen. 

The third solution is to fight 
for maintaining the UC system as 
a public institution (how it was 
envisioned by the California Master 
Plan, which is still the law of our 
state). This fight cannot be fought 
for the UC system only, otherwise 
any extra dollar for the UC system 
will have to be taken from else-
where. Taking from other vulnera-
ble institutions would pit us against 
the California State University sys-
tem, K-12 education, healthcare for 
poor children and other constituen-
cies, each with its own legitimate set 
of needs. We would be divided and 
conquered. 

The only hope of success is to 
fight for sweeping political change. 
Think big, act politically. There 
has to be a healthcare reform and a 
complete overhaul of the criminal 
justice system. Most importantly,

THE NEW ROBOT By Alec Zachreson

Dear Editor,
I want to commend you on the 

thoughtful summary your editorial 
board made in regard to the meeting 
with UC President Yudof and the cur-
rent economic crisis of the UC system. 
With the misinformation and political 
gesturing surrounding the California 
budget and public universities, it is 
important for students to understand 
the rock-and-a-hard-place spot that 
we are all in right now.

UCSD is at a tipping point in its 
history as one of the finest research 
institutions in the country and, argu-
ably, the world. How do we maintain 
the highest quality of education 
without the budget to back it? In the 
past, when money and resources were 
available, we were able to attract top 
faculty, staff and administration to the 
campus. The resulting excellence of 
information coming from UCSD does 
more than collect accolades; it actually 
increases the value of your degree. 

Each student who comes to 
UCSD chooses to come here in order 
to best set themselves up for their 
future. They want to graduate with 
this university’s name on their degree 
and resume because they believe the 
opportunities here will translate to a 
high paycheck down the road. It’s a 
simple business return: The greater 
the reputation of your university, the 
greater the return you will get on your 
investment in your education.

For whatever misconceptions are 
out there about how much money UC 
campuses do or don’t have, or how it 
is or isn’t spent, the reality is this: The 
amount of money you pay for your 
education barely dents the amount 
of what it costs to bring you to this 
campus, in a building, with a desk 
and a teacher before you. The state 
of California pitches in some money 

(but 50 percent less than it did 20 
years ago), and the rest has to come 
from creative funding. How? The 
Student Foundation has your answer: 
Day Tuition Ends will be featured on 
Library Walk during the Chancellor’s 
5K Challenge on Oct. 23, and will 
tell you exactly how far your dollar is 
stretched in your education. Trust me, 
it’s not as far as you think.

With the proposed fee increases, 
you are being asked to invest more 
in your education than ever before. 
Maintain the value of your investment 
by taking the Chancellor’s Challenge 
and becoming an I-Pledge donor 
to give directly to student scholar-
ships. Or put your mouth where your 
money is and let California know 
exactly how you have been impacted 
by budget cuts with three simple clicks 
at advocacy.ucsd.edu. 

As an alumnus and UCSD staff 
member, I sympathize with students 
facing financial hardship from the 
proposed fee increases. Due to budget 
cuts, I’ve seen top-of-the-field faculty 
recruitments pulled off the table, my 
pay decrease by nearly 18 percent and 
colleagues laid off. But I believe access 
to higher education is the future for 
a successful California, and I will 
keep pushing until every student who 
wants to be here gets the resources 
they need to succeed. Come join the 
fight.

The recipe — a brainchild of the 
Food Network’s Paula Deen — was 
incredibly simple, and my aunt’s 
handy electronic beater helped get the 
job done quick. 

By mixing a few cups of vegetable 
oil, buttermilk, all-purpose flower and 
sugar with two eggs — along with a 
few teaspoons of cocoa powder, salt, 
baking soda, vinegar, red food color-
ing and vanilla extract — I created 
a doughy cupcake foundation, then 
poured the mixture into individual 
cupcake racks and placed them in the 
oven at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.

I’ll admit it: Making the cream-
cheese frosting should have made me 
feel like a terrible person. There has 
to be something wrong with mixing 
one pound of cream cheese with four 

cups of sugar and two sticks of butter 
— but any hint of moral guilt was lost 
on me as I burrowed into the happy 
place of my inner child and licked the 
frosting off of each individual beater.

After the cupcakes had risen per-
fectly in their slots, I slabbed on the 
frosting and garnished them with red 
sprinkles for some extra presenta-
tion points. Considering the univer-
sally heart-warming aroma of freshly 
baked cake that was wafting through-
out my townhouse, I wasted no more 
time in guiltlessly indulging in a 
warm, fresh cupcake. Inner child was 
in full force by the time I’d stuffed the 
rest into my mouth. No more Geisel 
smoking breaks for me — I could get 
used to this whole baking gig.

Editor’s note: We ate his cupcakes. 
They were delicious.

University of Wisconsin, Madison 
began charging an extra $500 for 
undergraduates pursuing a degree in 
business administration. Likewise, 
students in engineering and nursing at 
Arizona State University pay $300 and 
$750 more, respectively, per semester. 

Supporters of differential tuition 
costs love to tout the higher median 
salaries of professors in certain fields. 
Last year’s National Faculty Survey 
found that professors in engineering 
and business management earn, on 
average, $112,347 and $108,230 a year, 
respectively. By contrast, the average 
English literature professor rakes in a 
comparatively paltry $79,854.

The rationale is simple: Higher 
operating costs demand that students 
pay a higher price.  

Those supporting the fee increase 
also claim that its increased annual 
revenue — projected to be around $10 
million, after factoring in $5 million 
for financial aid — would help retain 
top-notch faculty and preserve the 
high standards for which these pro-
grams are known.

But against the backdrop of 
unprecedented lows in state fund-
ing and steep student fees, selective 
tuition increases would do more harm 
than good. With each passing fee hike, 
a UC education limits its appeal to 
prospective students. While the uni-
versity may need to cut enrollment, 

admits shouldn’t be tempted to trash 
admission letters on their own.

Paying an additional $900 a year 
to major in engineering or business 
(or, on our campus, only the former, 
as we lack a business program) could 
even prevent some students interested 
in these fields from pursuing them, 
despite the renown and prestige of 
specialized programs in these disci-
plines offered at UC campuses. 

It’s true that a degree in mechani-
cal engineering is more advantageous 
in today’s job market than one in, say, 
history. But the proposal bypasses 
other majors that will arguably turn 
out equally successful graduates. For 
instance, a degree in the biological 
and physical sciences — both fields 
that attract a high volume of students 
and require a hefty investment of 
resources to support their curricula 
— is just as likely to get a student a 
well-paying job as an engineering or 
business degree.

The regents’ singling out of engi-
neering and business majors based 
on generalized assumptions of their 
potential for post-graduate success is 
shortsighted, especially given the cur-
rent recession. 

Should this proposal eventually 
pass, it would also likely cause resent-
ment not only among those students 
who will be forced to pay more, but 
those who won’t, too. Because in pass-
ing the proposal, the regents would 

essentially be placing a greater value 
upon engineering and business pro-
grams than the rest. 

Engineering programs are espe-
cially notorious for the endless list of 
courses they require students to take 
before graduation. Because of larger 
class sizes and fewer course offerings, 
students are often hard-pressed to 
complete their degrees within four 
years, and many stay even longer. 
With these new fee increases in place, 
engineering students — who represent 
about 14 percent of UCSD’s student 
body — will have a much more 
expensive way out of college than the 
rest of us, especially given the com-
mon necessity of a fifth year. 

Perhaps an additional $900 won’t 
bring tuition to private-school lev-
els, but it will nevertheless decrease 
access to the university. Engineering 
students can’t just tap into the full 
bank accounts they’re expected to 
hold in the distant future; they, like 
their Chaucer-studying peers, are still 
struggling students when the tuition 
bills are due. 

So while it may seem an easy step 
out of the deficit, banking on a select 
group of students to pay more than the 
rest isn’t the answer — especially given 
the fact that, in this economy, success 
isn’t guaranteed for anyone anymore.

VONS, PACIFIC BEACH

T
raversing the cliffs and 
craters of Iceland — tiny 
nation, monster volcanic 
hotspot — has long been 
compared to stepping foot 
on another planet.

Or at least the moon: In 1965 and 
1967, a group of 25 American astronauts 
semi-secretly rehearsed what would be 
the first lunar landing in the Icelandic 
outback.

Indeed, Greenland’s slightly balmier 
neighbor is out of this world. Iceland is 
essentially a floating slab of volcanic rock 
— dark, jagged, rolling rock — pushed 
up from the bottom of the ocean, stud-
ded by geysers, gurgling mud pots and 
sky-blue pockets of steaming water. In 
its capitol of Reykjavik, which contains 
two-thirds of the country’s population 
— a mere 200,000 people — the stench 
of sulfur tumbles from every faucet, and 
underground pipes of hot-spring water 
run beneath each doorstep to melt the 
snow that falls there. In summer, the sun 
sets for barely four hours; in winter, the 
sky sleeps in an almost eternal night.

But Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography geochemist David Hilton 
finds Iceland to be anything but other-
worldly. According to Hilton, the island 
is formed by an up-rush of underwater 
lava — what he calls a “geothermic 
plume,” shot from the Earth’s deep man-
tle layer — making it the closest thing we 

have to a piece of primordial Earth.
Ever since he based his doctoral thesis 

on Icelandic findings in the early ’80s, 
Hilton has returned over a dozen times 
to the remote island to collect additional 
samples of its ancient gasses. Still, he 
said, the Icelandic landscape never fails 
to amaze him.

“It’s rugged; it’s mountainous; you 
have these fantastic glaciers,” he said. 
“You have deserts — vast plains where 
there’s very little vegetation, just rocks. 
You have other parts of Iceland where 
there’s massive rivers coming from the 
glaciers; so it’s varied, it’s rugged.”

Hilton and a team of graduate stu-
dents — including Scripps superstars 
Evelyn Füri and Peter Barry — made 
their three most recent trips to Iceland 
in 2006, 2007 and 2008, running on 
two $200,000 grants from the National 
Science Foundation. Despite the eco-
nomic downturn, Hilton said he’s actu-
ally seen a boost in funding for research 
projects like his own.

“When Obama came in, he had the 
stimulus package, so actually a lot more 
money went into the National Science 
Foundation,” Hilton said. “So, [the eco-
nomic crisis] has had the opposite effect 
there actually … There’s more funds out 
there to go and get, to do science.”

With the help of local land experts, 
the team collected as much as 200 
pounds in samples per trip. They 
extracted water from fumaroles — 
gassy holes in the Earth’s surface — and 
hammered off pieces of rock and glass 
from the island’s crust, which would

BOOKREVIEW

MANTLEPIECE of 
th

e
BY SIMONE WILSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER

E ileen Myles, New York 
grunge poet 
(for lack of 
better label/
in defiance of 
applying “lesbi-
an” or “punk”) 
and head of the 
UCSD writing 
department up 
until two tragic years past, has a new 
geographical obsession. And though 
her obsessive tendencies are volcano-
years from the nitrogen extraction 
lines of Scripps noble-gas wizard 
David Hilton, the two professors 
share a perplexed awe for the semi-
depressing mid-Atlantic lava lump 
that is everyone’s favorite Iceland.

Obsessed as she was, or may still 
be, it seems Myles couldn’t, in the 
end, stretch her stream of conscious-
ness on Iceland any longer than 38 
pages, including back-translated 
Icelandic poem and black-and-white 
waterfall print. (Must be hard out 
there for a barebones poet who’s used 
to maxing pages at 20 words and a 
sea of thinky white space.) But she 
was right in thinking her excellent 
title and its accompanying glacier 
graphic, and all the Iceland that fills 
our heads between the two, would 
serve as a hell of a rock for the stack 
of leafy art writings that follow. 

Though it may be illusion, all her 
unrelated ramblings do seem to tie 
back to Iceland. Every long-ish word 
seems to spell Iceland backward and 
all cliquey name-drops seem only 
a few degrees from an unknown 
ancestor — and wait is Walden Pond 
in Iceland? — who makes his or her 
home on a crusty chip of geothermal 
plumage, way out you-know-where.

What with all the Bjork/Sigur 
Ros/sheepherder hype, Iceland is 
bordering on too trendy for Myles, 
a swaggering lesbian (shit, I said it) 
who’s always been two steps ahead 
of cool, but never too Cool for You. 
She loudly (smartly) acknowledges 
this obviousness early on. Even gets 
a little possessive, as artists do when 
something they love is popular for 
the wrong reasons. Like, come on, 
everyone just knows it in terms of 
not being Greenland. Or goes there 
on a cheap pit stop to greater Europe.

Myles even goes so far as to sneak 
a latter-page vignette on the nauseat-
ingly hip yet actually awesome Bjork 
— “baby tyrant, very formal” — and 
her following of actually hip hipsters 
— “full of very good clothes” — and 
it’s a good and loving feeling, she 
keeps telling us, but we’re just not 
part of it. We just keep squeezing 
Iceland to death with our love, but 
it’s only ever going to belong to those 
who made their home on the rock, 
who lost their sheep to the lava, who 
drank themselves silly through days 
which are nights. For us, it’s just a 
place to be lonely. And a poet does 
love to be lonely.

THE IMPORTANCE
OF BEING ICELAND 
EILEEN MYLES

BRIDGE BETWEEN TWO CONTINENTS

A Formed from a plume of volcanic activity,ICELAND offers Scripps researchers achance to get their hands on

FOUR THINGS YOU NEVER KNEW YOU DIDN’T KNOW ABOUT ICELAND

See ICELAND, page 10

There were no roads — we had to take a 
boat to get to the bay where we started 

hiking. And then here was this huge river, and we 
had to cross this river to get to all the hot springs and 
fumaroles on the other side. So we all took our socks 
and shoes off, and our trousers off, so we were just 
in our underpants — in the middle of nowhere, so 
nobody sees you, you know? And then we walked 
across this river. It was the most painful experience of 
my life. This water was incredibly cold. It was coming 

straight off a glacier, you know? And then your legs go numb, and you have 
pins and needles, and you’re walking like you’re on stilts. And you think, ‘Oh my 
god, if I fall over now’ — because the water was up to there — ‘I’m gonna die.’ 
And then you get to the other side, and oh, you’re in agony.

“But then you get to the hot springs, and all the steam is there, so you warm 
up, quickly, you know? And then you’re OK, and you can collect a sample.

“But then you have to get back to the other side. I remember there was an 
old guy, a farmer, an Icelandic guy, and he saw the distress I was in. And on the 
way back, he was looking at me, and I was looking at him, and I was looking 
for somewhere very easy to cross. And then he turned around, and he went 
like this — [pats back] — and immediately, I was on his back, and he gave me a 
piggyback across the river, thank god for that! I later found out how old he was: 
He was 79, and at the time I was 29, so he was 50 years older than me, and he 
carried me across the river. It was incredible.”

On one of his first trips to Iceland, while trekking to a remote glacier,
Hilton said he faced one of the biggest physical challenges of his life.

More than active volcanoes or scalding hot springs, Hilton said he is
apprehensive of transport to foreign sampling sites.

Probably the worst thing [about field research] is the traffic. You’re in a 
new country — like in Turkey, for example, or in Indonesia, in particular 

— and you’re driving around the whole country, usually with a local driver. The 
only time I’m really scared is like — the traffic. Some of these guys are crazy 
drivers, you know? And I’m like, oh my god, I’m going to die! So it’s actually nice 
to get to the volcano. You feel safe. You got a little bit of control there.”

Hilton is currently teaching the geographic portion of uber-popular un-
dergraduate course SIO 30  — or “The Oceans” — for non-science majors. 
He said the class emphasizes what we can learn from studying the Earth’s 
oceans, such as trends in climate change.

One of the big current debates is obviously CO2 in the atmosphere,” 
Hilton said. “CO2 is an acid gas, so what it means is, the pH [level] of the 

oceans will start to go down the more CO2 you have in the atmosphere. And 
that has major implications for what can live in the oceans, and what can grow 
in the oceans … Living here in San Diego, maybe that’s important.”

For eight months, beginning in 1783, an eruption of the Laki fissure in southern Iceland killed 50 percent of the 
country’s livestock population. A subsequent 25 percent of the Icelandic human population died in the resulting 
famine. Additionally, the deadly haze of sulfur dioxide released in the eruption killed 
thousands throughout Europe and threw off the entire planet’s weather patterns.

Icelandic is so closely related to the medieval language of Old Norse that Icelandic 
children can most often read ancient Scandinavian documents. Don’t feel small yet? 
The Icelandic university system is free of cost for students, and the nation boasts a 
100-percent literacy rate.

The Icelandic word for computer is tölva, which comes from völva, or oracle — essentially named on the notion that 
computers can see the future. (Hey, there aren’t many Old Nordic options for scary-smart box of beeps and wires.) 

You can buy Icelandic lamb in Whole Foods, and — according to UCSD graduate student Berglind Maria Tómasdót-
tir — it’s much fresher and more “wild-tasting” than the New Zealand alternative.

OUT FROM UNDER THE BIG TOP
UNCOMMONfolk

BY ANGELA CHEN STAFF WRITER

ERIK JEPSEN/GUARDIAN

R unning away with the circus is a glamorous childhood dream — one that most of us 
abandoned once we found out about 
all the manure duty and realized 
clowns were, um, scary. But here to 
rekindle our earliest ambitions is 
Muir College sophomore Elizabeth 
Sibert: circus aerialist extraordi-
naire. 

You may have noticed her jug-
gling clubs on Sun God lawn. Or 
maybe you’ve seen her atop that 
unicycle, breezing past a sluggish 
student body on her way to classes. 
Either way, make sure to step aside.

“It makes for a lot of funny looks, 
and then people become roadblocks 
because they’re staring,” said Sibert.

There aren’t many places to walk 
a tightrope on campus, but accord-
ing to Sibert, she can do that too. 
And rumor has it the girl swings a 
mean trapeze.

Her obsession began in 5th grade 
during a Club Med family reunion 
to Mexico. Sibert said, the kids 
were shipped off to circus lessons 
to occupy their time. And it’s been 
occupying her time for a while now.

“I tried the flying trapeze there 
and loved it,” Sibert said. “I fell in 
love with the circus, and was doing 
all these crazy stunts that gave my 
mother heart failure.” 

The very next spring, she joined 
a circus camp to reconnect with 
her newfound affinity for acrobat-
ics — and has been an aerial stunt 
girl ever since. What’s more, for the 
past three summers, Sibert worked 
at Tito Gaona’s Flying Trapeze 
Academy and Flying Fantasy Circus, 
in Massachusetts, inspiring would-
be aerialists as young as six years old 

to do as she did.
Sibert said she specializes in 

eliciting shock and glee from her 
audiences. As an aerial specialist, 
she performs everything from flying 
trapeze to the aerial hoop — cart-
wheeling at upward of 20 to 25 feet 
off the ground.

“The circus is about crazy tricks 
and looking for ways to make the 
audience gasp, then laugh,” Sibert 
said. “It’s a fine line between horri-
fying, amazing, death-defying skills 
and comic relief.” 

Every skill requires a different 
set. Unicycle took Sibert over a 
month of daily practice to master, 
and the three-ball juggle a month 
on top of that. Now, she can juggle 
five balls or three clubs — seven, 
if passing to a partner — and is 
an enthused member of the Muir 
College Juggling Club. 

As for the more complicated 
tricks, Sibert said she has never been 
afraid of learning new aerial maneu-
vers — even when she’s dangling 
upside down, 25 feet above solid 
ground (no net, no mat), suspended 
by nothing but silk ribbons and con-
fidence in her own talents. 

Sibert said she has never been 
injured while doing any of the 
stunts.

“There’s definitely times when I 
think that what I’m doing is crazy, 
but with the right mentality, anyone 
can do it,” she said. “I’ve learned 
how to trust myself, and know 
what’s safe and what isn’t.”

Shock value isn’t the only upside 
of the circus for Sibert; she said she 
also digs the close-knit dynamic of 
the circus community — her second 
family.

“The circus is one of the few 
places where every single human 
being is accepted as the core of who 
he or she is,” Sibert said. “There’s 
no need to put on a face. You’re 
accepted point-blank with no strings 
attached. You support each other.” 

Despite her apparent passion 
for the circus, Sibert said her aerial 
aspirations almost fizzled out com-
pletely when she first arrived to 
UCSD. 

“There was the Muir Juggling 
Club, but I couldn’t find anything 
with aerials, so I was just going to 
focus on school. I thought, ‘I’m done 
for now.’”

Turned out she was wrong.
“I happened across someone who 

needed an aerial partner through 
another person in the Muir Juggling 
Club,” Sibert said. “Within a quarter 
I was heavily involved.”

Now, Sibert trains and coaches 
with what she describes as “a group 
of people who have found each 
other over the years” — a new circus 
family.

What does the future hold for 
this one-wheeled campus won-
der? Sibert said though she does 
have aspirations to pursue marine 
biology at the Scripps Institute of 
Oceanography, she is heavily con-
sidering taking a gap year before 
graduate school to travel with a pro-
fessional circus. 

“Circus isn’t something that can 
wait until after I obtain my PhD. 
The tricks are rough on the body,” 
Sibert said. “It’s in my blood, in my 
life.”

later release trapped gasses when 
crushed in the lab.

According to Hilton, when hot 
lava hits seawater, it freezes almost 
instantly inside a shell of glass. 
Because the particular volcanoes 
that formed Iceland erupted beneath 
glaciers, their magma froze espe-
cially quickly — creating ideal glass 
samples for tests such as Hilton’s, 
packed tight with gasses frozen in 
their original states. Compared to 
more common, superficial “sub-
duction” volcanoes, which end up 
recycling their own elements as one 
plate of land slides under the other, 
Iceland’s 130-plus volcanoes are 
spewing material from up to 2,900 
kilometers down.

In this way, Hilton said Iceland’s 
trapped volcanic gasses could teach 
us about the conditions of early 
Earth. When compared to meteorite 
samples, they could reveal similari-
ties between our planet’s deep man-
tle and the primordial composition 
of the solar system. Or, when com-
pared to modern volcanic material, 
they could demonstrate the changes 
Earth’s atmosphere has undergone 
since then.

“If you adopt a holistic approach, 
you want everything,” he said. “You 
want the deep stuff in Iceland, and 
you want the shallow stuff in the 
subduction zones. And in fact, that’s 
what I do. Any kind of volcano, I’m 
interested in.”

Indeed, Hilton seems to have 
a soft spot for all things volcanic. 
Originally from England, the Scripps 
researcher and professor is the 
friendly library type, with British 
teeth and the kind of voice that 
could score him a gig in Discovery 
Channel narration; the kind of 
soothing, all-knowing forefather 
voice that makes even the most eye-
crossing geographical jargon a thing 
of fascination. In Hilton’s travel pho-

tos — sticking a tube into a pile of 
mud or grinning his windbreaker off 
in front of a volcano — he radiates 

the simple 
glamour of a 
man and his 
science.

“What 
tourists do is 
go out and 
about to see 
the scenery, 
which is what 
we’re doing 
anyway — but 
with a pur-
pose,” he said.

On last 
year’s final 
trip north, 
Hilton round-
ed up one 
particularly 
pure Icelandic 
sample: 

Sæmundur Halldórsson, a University 
of Iceland graduate student.

“[Halldórsson] has been out and 
about in Iceland so much, that he 
virtually knows every hill, and every 
valley, and every lava flow,” Hilton 
said. “And he can tell you the differ-
ence between this lava flow and that 
lava flow — it’s fantastic.”

Halldórsson, a classically rosy-
cheeked, towheaded islander, fol-
lowed the famed geochemist back to 
Scripps with wife and music student 
Berglind Maria Tómasdóttir in tow 
— who likewise transferred her stud-
ies to the UCSD music department. 
They are new parents to a two-
month-old baby girl named Anna 
Signy, and plan to see their doctor-
ates through for four or five years 
before returning to Iceland.

Tómasdóttir, who is a contem-
porary flutist, described Iceland’s 
intimate, “vibrant” music scene as 
“basically a group of people that play 
in all the different bands.”

In describing the folks back 
home, both Icelanders agreed that 
the island’s natural environment has 
a lot to do with the way the popula-
tion is shaped.

“Geographically, there’s a lot of 
energy,” Tómasdóttir said. “And they 
believe they can do almost every-
thing.”

“But it’s like a balloon of air,” 
Halldórsson said.

“Not really,” continued 
Tómasdóttir. “But sometimes it 
would be better to be a little more 
organized. But the energy is there.”

Kind of ironic, Halldórsson 
admitted, leaving behind studies 
in geography at the University of 
Iceland (under the wing of professor 
Karl Gronvold, who Hilton first met 
back in 1983, and who participated 
in the team’s recent field work) to 
coop himself up in the Scripps lab 
with small pieces of his home coun-
try. But Halldórsson said Hilton has 
also encouraged him to work with 
samples from other volcanic areas 
around the world.

“Hilton really wants me to think 
about something other than Iceland,” 
he said.

The graduate student won’t 
run out of material anytime soon; 
Hilton takes a dizzying amount of 
fieldtrips to keep the sample sup-
ply on overflow. His most recent 
expedition was to Eastern Turkey 
— where he collected samples from 
a fault similar to the San Andreas 
Fault here in California — but he’s 
also been to Africa, Japan, China, 
Indonesia, Hawaii and sites all over 
Latin America in the last few years 
alone.

Halldórsson noted that he would 
never have ended up at Scripps if it 
hadn’t been for his hotspot home-
town.

“We start to learn geology when

we’re doing

we’re 13 or 14,” he said. “The reason 
I’m interested in earth science is 
because I grew up in Iceland.”

Much has changed in Iceland 
since Hilton’s wide-eyed expedi-
tion in 1983, when he said he was 
surprised to find the country had no 
pubs — a.k.a. no beer — and no TV 
on Thursdays. However, Halldórsson 
said he’s seen a definite Western shift 
in what was once a more quiet, iso-
lated lifestyle.

“Iceland is fairly Americanized, 
actually,” Halldórsson said. “So we 
have all these fast-food chains and 
rubbish all around us.”

But there have also been many 
advances in research equipment over 
the last couple decades, including the 
technology needed to measure the 
isotope ratio in nitrogen — a large 
motivating factor for the most recent 
leg of the Iceland project. In order to 
extract the nitrogen from the Iceland 
samples, graduate student Barry 
first had to learn how to construct a 
nitrogen extraction line.

Thing is, the only other place on 
Earth where anyone was interested in 
such a contraption was the University 
of Tokyo. So Barry flew overseas for 
a crash course, then brought that 
knowledge back to Scripps, where it 
took him a year to re-create the line, 
at which point — much to the delight 
of his partners in noble-gas geochem-
istry — the nitrogen isotopes were 
finally ready to be measured by the 
mass spectrometer.

“We’re chained to our mass spec-
trometers,” Halldórsson said. 

After working with Hilton for 
over five years in the field of noble-
gas geochemistry, graduate student 
Füri has released the first draft 
of her doctoral dissertation: four 
separate reports on research she’s 
done in Monterey Bay, Costa Rica, 
the Central Indian Ridge and — of 
course — Iceland.

“What’s striking when you get 
there, is there are almost no trees,” 
Füri said. “And of course, for a geol-
ogist, that’s amazing, because it’s all 
lava — all rock.”

She said that gas samples from 
subaerial Iceland were more dif-
ficult to analyze than those from 
the other three underwater loca-
tions included in her dissertation, 
because much of the lava ended up 
being de-gassed, or contaminated 
by air.

“We don’t want [the samples] to 
be weathered or eroded — we want 

them to be quite fresh — but they 
can still be several million years old,” 
Füri said.

In the end, however, the team 
collected and tested enough 
original deep-mantle material to 
confirm and advance previous, 
more piecemeal research showing 
that volcanic material in Iceland is 
indeed very similar to the Earth’s 
primordial composition, and that 
its gasses can even be compared to 
solar wind.

“I mean, it’s kind of the question 
of, why do we care?” Füri said. “But 
Earth is so unique. I just think it’s 
important that we know more about 
the planet we live on.”

Using samples from their most recent trips to Iceland, Hilton (pictured here with Icelandic graduate

Looking for a great pharmacy school?

took off on an 8-1 run, marked by 
clutch kills from Schmidt and a solid 
defense. 

While much of the Tritons’ suc-
cess this season has been generated 
by the team’s offense, defensive play-
ers proved just as decisive this time 
around: Most of the Coyotes’ hits 
were handled and passed on target. 

The Coyotes could not muster 
much offensive strength as UCSD 
cruised to a 25-16 victory in the 
second set.

“The girls did what they trained 
to do,” head coach Tom Black said. 
“They kept doing what they needed 
to do. There’s no magic involved.”

Though the second set left the 
Coyotes looking defeated and the 
Tritons poised to sweep the con-
ference leaders, Cal State San 
Bernardino turned in a solid third-
game performance to claw back into 
the game. 

A Triton offense that had been 
stellar for the first two sets could not 
penetrate the Coyote block, and Cal 
State San Bernardino won its first 
set 25-13.

The Coyotes started strong in 
the fourth set, jumping out to an 
early lead. As San Bernardino pow-
ered through the UCSD defense, the 
Triton bench — fueled by the cheer-
ing crowd — expressed their disap-
proval of a referee’s call, resulting in 
a yellow card for the UCSD bench. 

The penalty only served to cata-

lyze the Triton players, and UCSD 
surged past the Coyotes to grab a 
21-19 lead.

After a pair of San Bernardino 
time outs — and with a 23-19 lead 
— the Tritons finished the match 
with a resounding block 
to secure the win and seek 
revenge against the only 
team to have beaten them 
this season.

“The best part is that 
we beat them,” Schmidt 
said. “We had a great 
crowd tonight, and 
they’re kind of a rival for 
us.”

The night before tak-
ing on the Coyotes, UCSD 
went up against the Cal 
Poly Pomona Broncos, 
a team the Tritons had 
already defeated early in 
the season. In the first 
set of the night, sopho-
more outside hitter Katie 
Condon quickly put 
down eight kills in the set. 

UCSD jumped out to an early 
lead, with Chen leading the charge 
by setting tight balls on the net and 
ringing up multiple assists. 

The Tritons’ offense was relent-
less, and Schmidt continued the 
powerful swings. Redshirt freshman 
middle blocker Julia Freidenberg 
provided crucial blocks on potential 
Bronco kills, as the Tritons cruised to 
a 25-18 victory. 

“Elaine’s setting was awesome,” 
Condon said. “We wanted to start 
strong, and that’s what we did.”

In the second set, UCSD took 
advantage of several key Bronco mis-
takes. The Tritons easily overpow-

ered Pomona and raced 
to a 25-11 victory with 
more solid hitting and a 
game-winning kill from 
Condon.

“We were really 
focused,” Black said. “We 
didn’t make many errors 
in the set, and were able 
to win.”

Looking to avoid a 
three-set sweep, Cal Poly 
Pomona came out tough 
in the third set. The 
Broncos played resilient-
ly, and the Tritons were 
unable to pull away. 

Cal Poly Pomona 
battled the Tritons evenly 
throughout the set and 
pulled within two scores 

to 18-16 — before UCSD went on 
another solid run to finish off the 
game with a final score of 25-21.

The Tritons begin their second 
half of conference play on Oct. 
21, when they travel to Cal State 
Dominguez Hills to play a night 
match, before returning home on 
Oct. 23 to play Cal State Los Angeles.

goal lead. UCSD had numerous 
chances in the game’s final two and 
one-half minutes, but two untimely 
turnovers cost the Tritons a chance 
at victory.  

 After taking a 2-0 lead early in 
the game, both teams traded goals 
one-for-one on 15 consecutive scores 
— a testament to evenly matched and 
gritty performances from both teams. 
Donohoe, Gresham and junior driver 

Ryan Allred each picked up two goals 
for the Tritons, who have lost two 
out of their past three nail-bitting 
matches. 

The ability to stay close to some 
of the nation’s top-ranked teams 
gives UCSD the poise and confi-
dence to battle through their current 
skid, failing to get above .500 all 
season long.

“Right now it’s just about a lot of 
guys getting their confidence back 

and getting back in their groove, 
and playing like we were during the 
offseason,” Morton said. “Since I’ve 
been in his program, I’ve noticed that 
our team progressively gets better 
throughout the course of the season. 
It’s a matter of putting all the right 
pieces together and getting our com-
posure back.”

The Tritons hit the road again for 
a five-game trip through Southern 
California from Oct. 23 to Oct. 31. 

The trip starts with a match against 
UC Irvine in a rematch of Oct. 11’s 
game which saw the Tritons drop a 
8-7 match. The Southern California 
tour and three-game home stand that 
follows will be UCSD’s final prepa-
ration for the Western Water Polo 
Association Championships, begin-
ning Nov. 20.

Friday, allowing a season-high three 
scores. Outshooting UCSD 7-1 in 
the first half, the Toros scored on a 
header off the cross for a 1-0 lead. 

UCSD didn’t get on the board 
until the Toros netted their third and 
final goal in the 79th minute. Senior 
midfielder Kyle Parton broke away 
from the defense for his first career 
goal, cutting CSUDH’s lead to 3-1 in 
the 85th minute. 

Parton earned an assist on junior 
midfielder David Bakal’s goal in the 
89th, which brought the Tritons  
within one score. However, UCSD’s 
early deficit proved too deep to over-
come when they fell 3-2.

“Our approach was to put 
pressure on [Dominguez Hills] 
and not let them get in a rhythm. 
Dominguez Hills never felt com-
fortable, but they were able to capi-
talize on our mistakes,” Pascale said. 
“We were able to get a few goals late 
and definitely made it interesting, 
and our guys showed a lot of charac-
ter, sticking with the game plan the 
whole time.”

The fourth-place Tritons now 
return home to face Cal State San 
Bernardino, sitting in third place, 
and fifth-place Cal Poly Pomona in 
the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association South Division. The last 
time they faced those two squads this 
season, the Tritons lost to the Coyotes 
1-0 and beat the Broncos by the same 
score.

“At this point, we’ve seen every-
body once this season, and we don’t 
feel like there’s anybody we can’t beat.”

TENNIS — After defeating a doubles 
team from Sonoma State on Oct. 3 
and earning the title of Intercollegiate 
Tennis Association West Region 
Doubles Champions, junior Armaun 
Emami and redshirt freshman Austin 
West advanced to the ITA National 
Small College Championship in 
Mobile, Ala. from Oct. 15 to Oct. 18.

The Triton duo emerged from the 
competition in fourth place after a 
strong showing on Oct. 15, but two 
losses the following day ended their 
run at an ITA national title.

In the championship’s open-

ing match, Emami and West faced 
Midwestern State University’s 
Vjekoslav Stipanic and Bo Ziputovic 
in the quarterfinals. Stipanic and 
Ziputovic entered the match with a 
10-1 record.

Undaunted by their opponent’s 
impressive record, Emami and West 
beat Stipanic and Ziputovic 7-6, 6-2 
in a tough battle. After winning a 
gruelling first set with an 8-5 tie-
breaker, the pair pulled away in the 
second set for an easy victory.

“It was a battle for that first set,” 
UCSD assistant coach Timmer 
Willing said. “After the tiebreaker 
win, they relaxed and settled in. We 
made a few adjustments to our strat-
egy, and it took the other team out of 
their rhythm.”

West, in his first competitive sea-
son as a Triton, said he was happy 
with the dynamic between him and 
teammate Emami.

“It was the first time we’ve com-

peted together in doubles, but I think 
our playing styles match up well,” 
West said. “We certainly complement 
each other.”

Emami finished No. 2 in the 2009 
spring season with a 4-1 record. For 
most of the previous doubles season, he 
was paired with sophomore Chapman 
Chan, who is currently paired with 
redshirt junior Alex Placek.

On the tournament’s sec-
ond day, Emami and West faced 
Francis Marion University’s Oshada 
Wijemanne and Dilshod Sharifi, the 
No. 2 seeded team in the champion-
ship. The opponent had trounced 
a team from Southern Indiana the 
previous day. 

The game did not end well for 
Emami and West either, losing in 
straight sets 6-0, 6-0.

Following the difficult loss, Emami 
and West had the chance to salvage 
one last win at the ITA National Small 
College Championship with a match 

against Bloomsburg University’s 
Fernando Perez and Ricky Dove in 
the battle for third place. 

However, 6-2 and 6-3 falls guar-
anteed the Triton duo a fourth-place 
finish at the championship.

“We’ll try to learn from our mis-
takes today,” West said. “It was a 
battle out there, and we need to figure 
out how to beat the better teams.”

UCSD’s last appearance at the 
ITA Championship was in 2007, 
when seniors Eric Rubens and Blake 
Meister clinched the doubles event.

The Tritons will participate 
in their next competition at the 
Southern California Intercollegiates 
in Los Angeles from Nov. 4 to Nov. 
8. The five-day event will be the final 
competition of the Triton’s fall season 
before they take a break from com-
petitive play until February.

For the first time since 
2007, UCSD tennis 
competed in the ITA 
Championships.

HOTCORNERLINGO LEXICON
Redshirt red-shurt, n —
An athlete kept out of varsity play for 
one season while participating in a   
university’s academic year in order 
to develop skills and extend NCAA         
eligibility. 

WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL — 
Motivated by the thunderous 
applause from the homecoming 
weekend crowd, the UCSD women’s 
volleyball team defeated No. 2 Cal 
State San Bernardino in four games, 
handing the Coyotes their first loss 
of the season. 

The hype surrounding UCSD’s 

homecoming weekend was a boost 
for the Tritons in their most impor-
tant match of the season — filling 
the stands with former alumni and 
family, along with throngs of spirited 
students. 

The women avenged their only 
loss of the season, a Sept. 11 fall to 
the same San Bernardino squad. The 

Tritons are now tied for first place 
with the Coyotes in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Conference and 
now sport a 20-1 overall record, 12-1 
in-conference.

“It feels amazing to get the win,” 
senior captain setter Elaine Chen 
said. “I’m proud of the team for what 
we’ve accomplished.”

In the first set of the night, San 
Bernardino came out strong with 
a powerful offensive attack, but 
the Tritons adjusted and regained 
momentum early in the set.

“They had powerful hitters,” 
senior captain outside hitter Sylvia 
Schmidt — who finished the night 
with a team-leading 18 kills — said. 
“We just focused and played well and 
passed well.”

UCSD demonstrated a calm 
demeanor early on, putting the 
Coyotes down 25-19 in the first set 
of the match, with Schmidt deliver-
ing the game-winning kill.

In the second set, the Tritons 
capitalized on key Coyote errors, but 
a slew of their own mistakes early 
on kept UCSD from grabbing con-
trol. With the score tied 6-6, UCSD

MEN’S WATER POLO — In a 
repeat of the 2009 season opener, 
UCSD hosted the UC Santa Barbara 
Gauchos in a non-conference match 
on Oct. 16 at the Coggan Family 
Aquatic Complex. 

Much like their first game nearly 
two months ago, the Tritons bat-
tled to stay close with the Gauchos 
throughout the match, but saw a late 
rally fall short as they were defeated 
9-7. 

The loss drops UCSD’s record to 
9-10 on the season, and the Gauchos 
improve to 9-6. 

Despite the tough loss, sopho-
more goalkeeper David Morton said 
he had high hopes for the regular 
season’s eight remaining games.

“I expect our team to improve; I’m 
not too worried about our record,” 
Morton said. “It is a losing record, 
but we’ve played a lot of competitive 
games and lost a lot of close games. I 
don’t think our record really reflects 
how we’re doing to a certain extent, 
because the majority of our games 
have been against top-10 opponents.”

UCSB took control early in the 
game, scoring two goals in the first 
three minutes to open the first 
period. Senior two-meter defender 
Steven Donohoe cut the Gaucho lead 
in half by converting on a penalty 
shot to put UCSD on the board. 
He added another goal two minutes 
later, and the first period ended with 
a 4-2 UCSB advantage. 

Both teams exchanged goals 
evenly during the second and third 
periods, as the Gauchos clung to 
their two-score lead heading into the 
game’s final frame. 

Senior two-meter defender Peter 
Gresham led a fourth-period Triton 
attack that nearly resulted in a come-
from-behind victory. Just 38 seconds 
into the final period, Gresham scored 
to pull within one of the Gauchos, 
but UCSB rebounded with a goal of 
its own 30 seconds later.

After two more possessions, 
the Tritons scored off a shot from 
Gresham to once again pull within 
one goal of their opponents — but, 
as was the pattern in the game, UCSB 
immediately scored to regain its two-

MEN’S SOCCER — Coming off a 
two-game sweep of conference cel-
lar dwellers Cal State East Bay, the 
Tritons faced off against teams at the 
top of their division last weekend. 
UCSD was unable to pull out an 
upset in either match, losing two con-
secutive one-goal road games. 

After falling behind 3-0 on Oct. 
16, the Tritons mounted a comeback 
in the final minutes against Cal State 
Dominguez Hills, but failed to erase 
the deficit.

Playing against Cal State Los 

Angeles on Oct. 18, UCSD was again 
unable to get on the board, taking the 
1-0 defeat.

Following the series, UCSD’s con-
ference record drops to 4-5-3 enter-
ing a game this Friday against Cal 
State San Bernardino.

Though UCSD’s defense played 
consistently well throughout 
Saturday’s match, the Triton offense 
struggled to create scoring opportu-
nities on Sunday against the Toros.

In the first half, UCSD did not 
attempt a single shot on goal. On the 
other side of the ball, senior goal-
keeper Peter Akman sent away all 14 
of CSULA’s shots. 

Starting the second half scoreless, 
the Golden Eagles wasted no time 
getting on the board, netting a goal 
in the 48th minute. The Tritons man-
aged five shots in the second half, but 
none of them got through CSULA’s 
defense. 

“I think that Cal State Los Angeles 
did a great job making it hard [for 
us] to get in a rhythm,” head coach 
John Pascale said. “They put a lot of 
pressure on the ball making life dif-
ficult for us. It was a combination of 
them being really good and us being 
a little off.”

Akman recorded a career-high 11 
saves in the game, but UCSD’s offense 
was unable to support its goalkeeper 
in the Tritons’ fifth shutout of the 
season. 

“Peter is an experienced goalkeep-
er, and he did for us what he’s been 
doing all year,” Pascale said. “His 
saves were excellent, but were well 
within his capabilities. He reads the 
game well and is very good techni-
cally.”

The Tritons struggled on both 
sides of the ball against CSUDH last

Senior forward Tony Choi saw his shot blocked late in UCSD’s Oct. 18 game versus Cal State Los Angeles. 
Choi’s unsuccessful shot was one of three failed Triton attempts to tie the score in the game’s final period, 
and the team lost 1-0 to the Golden Eagles. After the loss, the Tritons’ season record now stands at 4-5-3.
