UCAB melts A.S. ice

Board recommends 'healthy' 
dining option in Price Center

Au naturel: The Feb. 14 UCAB meeting recommended healthy food alternatrves 10 
the Pnce Center. The Food Co-op, whICh hopes to expand, may benefit from this.

News Editor to open a satellite site, but docs 

The University Centers 
Advisory Board Food Committee 
decided on Feb. 14 to recommend 
that a vendor prOVIding a 
"healthy, low-cost dining alterna-
tive," such as the Food Co-op, be 
granted operating space in the 
Price Center Gamcroom. 

The recommendation would 
effectively deter the A.S. Council's 
effort to open an Associated 
Studen ts-sponsored ice cream 
parlor in the same space. 

The food committec's recoll1-' 
Illendation does not specifically 

suggest that propo als from othcr 
student parties should be wcl-
comed, provided they intend to sell 
health food. 

"We are looking to provide stu-
dents with a 'grab-and-go' healthy 
food choice," said UCAB Vice 
Chair Ju tin Williams, who heads 
the food committee.

operated out of its current Student

Students and staff members 
gathered for a town hall meeting 
at the Student Leadership 
Chambers on Feb. 13 for a discus-
sion about Issues on campu with 
Student Regent Dexter Ligot-
Gordon, an undergraduate from 
UC Berkeley; other leaders from 
campus associations; and the 
admlllistra oon. 

Panel members included A.S. 
PreSIdent Jenn Brown, Graduate 
Student Assocl3lion Chm Tom 
Fleming, Staff Association Chair 
Patty rnelt and Vice Chancellor 
of tuuent AffaIrs Joseph Watson. 
Parllclpams ralseu concerns rang-
109 from the ClaSSIfication of 
Race, Ethniclty and ational 
Origin lIlitiallve; the Title IX 
Gender EqUIty statute; and issues 
about diversity at VCSD. 

"People were able to ee both 
siJes of the issues that the Board 
of Rcgents and the administration 
faces," said A.S. Executive 
Assistant Tracy Phillips, whocoor-
dina ted the event. 

The meeting was set up as an 
informal forum where participants 
engaged in discussions with the 
panel members. Audience mem-
bers were also able to ask ques-

Gordon and Watson for their 
stances on the various issues that 
were raised. 

One matter that Sixth College 
Council Chair Chris Sweteen 
brought up was the budget cut 
effects on outreach programs. 
According to Watson, though a 
decision is yet to be reached 
regarding specific cutbacks, prior-
ity is placed in redirecting 
resources to current students 

instead of outreach progrJm~. 
Meanwhile, Llgot-Gordon 
stressed that the Board of Regents 
is going to lobby for outreach pro-
grams in the legislanlre. 

"Outreach is core to the UC," 
Ligot-Gordon said. " rudents arc

BRIEFLY 
Professor receives grant to 
research handheld (levices 

Truong Nguyen, a professor In the Jacobs 
School of Ensineering's Electrical and 
Computer Englneenng department, will 
receive more than $200,000 over three 
years from Skyworks Solutions, Inc. and the 
University of Califomla's Industry-University 
Cooperative Research Program to fund 
research that could lead to smoother video 
streaming on wireless handheld devices. 

In early experiments, Nguyen has opti-
mized Video decoders to generate addittonal 
frames to produce a smooth Video 
sequence. At a 65K bit rate, an early proto-
type achieved 20 frames per second -
roughly double the number of frames 
streamed on the same deVice without 
Nguyen's modifications. This technology will 
be developed for live video applications, 
such as VIdeo conferencing and surveillance, 
but the process would also permit smoother 
streaming of movie or other clips over a wire-
less connection to a handheld. Target devices 
include mobile phones with screens, hand-
held PDAs and Web pads. 

Skyworks Solutions will fund the research 
project with $120,000 over three years. 
Skyworks IS the industry's leading wireless 
semiconductor company focused on RF and 
complete cellular system solutions for 
mobile communlcatJons applications. 

Jacobs School creates 
gene function model 

The first computer model that simulates 
gene function and cellular metabolism in 
yeast was created by bioenglneers at the 
Jacobs School of Engineenng and the 
Technical UniverSity of Denmark.. The model 
Integrates knowledge about yeast into a 
mathematical model capable of Simulating 
1,175 reactions produced by 708 genes 
interacting WIth 723 metabolites. 

As the first predictive genome-scale 
model for a eukaryollc cell, this model brings 
researchers one step closer to uStng com-
puter Simulations to aid In drug discovery. 

Because Its Internal signafing pathways 
are Similar to those of human cells, yeast is 
Widely used as a testbed for dlscovenng new 
knowledge about cell biology. SCientiSts also 
use yeast to study human disease, particu-
larly cancers and Inhented metabolic diS-
eases. In commerCial settings. yeast IS used 
to make foods and commodity chemicals.

cussed the effects of research uud-
get cuts on graduate students. 
According to rleming, research 
establishments like the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography arc 
fa cd \\,Ith the pnssihility of remov-
Ing Its speclIllen collection :lnd a 
research vc~sel. Such cuts, accord-
I ng to Fleming, "cause grad stu -
dents to suffer" because they have 
less oppornlllltic~ on theIr studies. 

ewly-appointed A.S. 
Commissioner of Academic Affairs 
ErnestO i\-Iartinez also brought con-
cerns about diversity among faculty 
members :tnd the studClll bod}'. I [is 
comlllents prompted discussion 
about the uJ1lvcrsity's role 111 Clhur-
ing a diversified environment. 

"Reprcscntanon within the fac-
ulty docs retl'"re some Improve-
ments," Arnell said. "That's why It 
i necessaty for information to be 
avaIlable to everyone regarding 

diversity." 
Llgot-Gordon also added that 

the root of the problem lies in an 
eligibility pool that docs not 
include many cthl1lcities . I Ie 
stressed the ll~portance of expand-

" The town hall 
meeting gave people the 
opportunity to engage. " 

- Dexter Ligot-Gordon, 
U( Student Regent 

ing the notion of eligibility and 
using outreach programs "as an 
undcrestllnatcd toul" in creating 
more diverse campuses. Other 

IS~UCS raIsed throughout the meet-
ing included further comments 
about diversity and concerns 

regarding the effects of Title lX on 
sports teams If the proportIonality 
clause is changeu . 

"The town ha II lIleeti ng gave 
people the opportunIty to engage," 
Ligot-Gordon said. " It is also one 
of the ways that [ try to hold myself 
accountable to the students and to 
the campuses." 

UCSJ) is the mth campus that 
Llgot-Gordon has visited for simi-
lar campus forums. According to 
Llgot-Gordon, one of the reasons 
for such llleetings IS for studen ts to 
comlllent about the work he has 
done so far as a Regent and for 
more input on other issues that 
currently need to be addressed. 

As the student regent for the 
2002-03 chool year, Llgot-
Gordon is a full voting member of 
the Board of Regents and helps 
eSlablish polIcies involvong UC 
matter . Michael lurray, the

COSA: Act would make students residents 
conrinued from page I 

college education to study in the 
United States. Even the dIstribu-
tion of scholarships and small al 
Grams Isn 't enough to pay for most 
college tuitions, Gonz::tles said. 

".ometime it 's really hard," 
Gonl.ales said. "YOll constantly 
think about what [Q do next, espe-
cia lly when the scholarship is gone. 
There's just no money to pay for 
college." 

If the D.R.E.A.M. Act is passed , 
it WIll allow certaon undocumented 
students to have the priVIlege of 
becoming "lawful residents of the 
Untted States" to attam highcr edu-
cation. There are rules Jnd regula-
tions to the act, oncludlllg heing 

under the age of 21 at the time of 
appli ation for adjustment, haVIng a 
high school dIploma at the time of 
application and having lived in the 
United State; for at least five years 
prior to the date of enactment. 

As WIth many acts and policies 
waiting to be pa sed in Congress, 
the D.R.E.A. 1. Act face many 
barriers in establishing its enact-
mcnt. 

" f feci like [Congress) is almost 
ignOring us," said CO A Ice 
President Abdul Aboushadi. "They 
have other priority issues, but they 
have ro know that it's something not 
to be Ignored. There are millions of 
people affected by this issue." 

When asked how long it will 
take for the act to be passed, 
Aboushadi said, "It might not pass 
at all, which is why we 're trying 
hard to facilitate it. But in the most 
part, It may take two years." 

Despite the apparent difficulty 
in passing the D.R.E.A.M. Act Into 
law, the government is not ignoring 
the issue in its entirety. A member 
of COSA stated thar Sen. Tom 
Daschle is introducing an education 
bill that addresses the issue of glv-
109 privileges to undocumented 
students, but it is a large bill and 
expensive to pass. He is also rein-
troducing the tudent Adjusonent 
Act.

W ith tensions and tem-pers flarll1g III Europe and the Umted tates 
over the fate of Satldam 

I 1 USSCIIl, IllS oppressive 
regime and the IIlnocent civi l-

Ian of Iraq, people arc rapidly 
polarlzlIlg. The man}' \\ ho shout"l 0 
war for oiP" and truly beheve that this 
entire situation rcvoh'es solely 
arowld U. . mopetary greed are 

not only ignorant of 
the facts. tratcgies 
and politics involved, 
but arc tlle pawns of 
the poliocians tn the 

vast International 
political game that i~ 

reaching a mmuluJOul> ch-
max. The biggest Impact tlus CrlSl, 

\\,,11 have is on a new era of European-
American relations . France and 
Germany are not opposing thc war 
due to moral~ and ethtcs, but rather lO 
mcrease their own countries' power 

Upon Invesugatlng the different 
aspects and Sides to the criSIS, Iraq 
fades into the background and two 
major players emerge. On one SIde i; 
the Uruted States. fu a country, we 
stand on the brink of two future rep-
uta uons: Itberators and defender. of 
freedom or bulhe and warmongers. 
The opponent IS the French and 
German alltance against the United 
States. T hey also face two future 
reputations: the enltghtcned, diplo-
matic defenders of the Innocent 
cl\~ltans or weak, Jealous countne 
Incapable of defendlllg themselves 
against threaterung enemies. 

In the tradItional spirit of prote.t-
mg, many anti-war proponents 
remain idealisuc, ~a)'lng that death 
and war is no way to topple I Ius etn. 
Wh.tlc they say that it would be good 
to depose the dIctator, our motive!, 
and methods are unjust, so nuhtary 
acoon should be e1111unated al> an 
opuon. If thl, IS a valid VIewpoint, It I~ 
sull a huge ITUstake to believe that 
France and Gennany are opposed to 
war merely becau the)' care for tile 
Innocent IraqiS. France and Germany 
are attacktng the lUted States-led 
pohcy for political rca,(Jn~, a~ much as

were being waved that read "U. . 
Come Help Us!" France sti ll holds 
grips on many of its fonner territories 
and is willing to take militaty action in 
those places, regardless of the justifia-

bility. However, it will not 
rake action 

against 
Iraq. 

A s 
recently 
as 1987 , 

France supplied 
Iraq with at lea t 

133 Mirage FI fighters, which which 
make up most of the Iraqi air force. 
Forty percent of the entirc Iraqi 
armed forces, Including attack heli -
copters, arollery and other combat 
velucle , were sent from FrAnce to 
Iraq. It i believed that much of the 
nuclear capability that Iraq could have 
obtained would have come from 
French suppliers a well. It IS a mi -
take to believe that France truly wants 
peace. 

Frances political maneuvering 
may be clearly seen through recent 
French dlploma(y. French President 
Jacques Chirac has lIlVlted Robert 
Mugabe, an infamous \~ObIOr of 

WORLD 
human nghts and an outspoken racist, 
to a French-African summit, despite 
tile Image the summit will be gIVen 
because of Mugabe's presence. TIllS 
makes sense, considering ' Iony Bl air 
and the Bnosh government, tile clO5\! 
U.S. albes, Insisted that Mugabe be 
refused admittance. Tlus wa~ a politi -
cal slap in the face to Britain and an 
assertion that France will not take 
orders 0 easily. 

As for ,ermany, the only reason 
that Chancellor Gerhard Shroedcr 
was re-elected was becau e he made 
l3!>l-Il1lnllle pleas to anti -war move-
ment supporters, who largely swu ng 
over to his ,Ide. Even then, hiS ViCto-
ry wa, the lI1tJ>t narrow of any 
German election. Undoubtedly, thiS 
was a key poliucallllove. As Shroeder

Europe against the "olu" Europe. 
When Donald RuIl1sfcld, talking in 
his usual wlapologetic, undiplomatic 
style, labeled France and Germany 
obsolete, he touched on the most 
volatile reason for the IntenSIty of tlus 
international game. France and 
Germany desperately do not want to 
give the United States the superpow-
er status it has commanded for the la~t 
50 years, and untlerstandably so. 
Politically, it IS sui cide to be powerlcs~ 
to stop your rival, whether diploJlla[J -
cally or militaril y. I f France and 
Germany ~pend too much ume Ilund-
lessly agreei ng with the UllIted States, 
the International COllllllUlllly wilt 
assume that they havc no po;\,cr to 
stop them. 

By pla)'lng the anti-war card, 
France anti Gerlilany ubtalilcd an 
enormous amount of symboliC power 
in Europe. Bmaln I. routinely bell1g 
attacked as the Untted tates' lap

ty has be!,'lIn to wonder 11 the Lillltcd 
Kmgdom has any power to sway U.S. 
foreign pohcy. France MId Germany 
arc becoming the alllJnce that has 
said "no" to tlle onl)' superpower. 

ThiS alli ance wa, dealt J \cnous 
blow by Rumsrcld's comments and 
the sub cquent leiter from eight 
"new" European countriC pledging 
to a United StJtes-Ied coalnion. 
Sudden ly, Francc anti Germany 
were not the noble dissenters of the 
oppressive Urliled States, hut a pall'

desperately for any power they 
could . Shrocder's populari ty

Suicide difficult to understand 
Death of student sparks reflection 

By SARAH HASSAINE 
Staff Writer 

Has anyone really thought 
about the late Natalie 
Summerfish? She decided to end 
her life on a beautiful Friday after-
noon. While the majority of snl-
dents were exci ted a bout the 
upcoming weekend or coming to 
terms with their homework load 
and shrugging it off, she believed 
that ending her life was the solu-
tion to her problems. My boss was 
the last person to see her a minute 
before she took her fall . She 
described Summerfish's eyes as 
empty and sad, as if one could 
wave a hand in front of them and 
they would not even blink. She 
said that there was a "bloodcur-
dling" scream, as if Summerfish 
had regretted her decision when it 
was too late. 

I never knew Summerfish, but 
I cried when I heard the story. 
Wasll't anyone there for her? Did 
she have anyone to turn to? The 
answers ro these rhetorical ques-
tions must be no, because her case 
was severe. Those I know say that 
she never talked to anyone about 
how she was feeling. What dis-
tresses me is that she just decided 
that ending her life was the only 
solution. Did she think she would 
not be missed? Did she feel 
unloved? 

I also find it perplexing that we 
all heard about the suicide and let 
it go in one ear and out the other. 
The reaction from students, or the 
lack of reaction, amazes me. \Me 
hear that someone is no longer 
among us, and lhere is an awL .. ward 
pause and a swift change of sub-

COMMENTARY 

" Whereas death is very 
much a part of Ufe I it 

should not be something 
that we choose for our~ 

selves. JJ 
jecr. One of the things that crossed 
Illy mind is the dynamics of social 
relations today. We see people and 
we stop for a minute to say hello, 
but it remains very much at a sur-
face level. We all are killed in say-
Ing, "What's up?" and "Nothing 
much," but what scares me is that 
there can be so much hidden 
behind those "superficial" greet-
ings. ummerfish 's suffenng may 
have gone unnoticed by her peers 
and her family. 

I believe in celebrating hfe. 
People around the world are d)'lng 

every minute. Others may be in 
hospital beds facing death but 
fighting with every ounce of 
strength in them to remain alive. 
Kids are left orphans, and parents 
lose their children. Whereas death 
is very much a part of life, it 
should not be something that we 
choose for ourselvcs. Suicide is a 
selfish act because life in itself IS a 
gi ft. I feel tha t the best a pproach is 
to take life lightly, because noth-
ing is really worth dramatically 
stressing over. Nothing can be so 
bad that it cannot be overcome. 

I can understand that life can 
spiral you into a world that at 
times feels so hopeless that you 
just want out. But despite the out-
side pressures and expectations, it 
is a better approach to realize that 
you have one life to live (ignore 
the cliche), and one should just 
live each day to the fulle t extent. 
We have the control to make it 
better. If one feels lonely and 
depressed, I think that they need 
to stop and think about what they 
do have in terms of health and 
opportunity, and take a stand in 
improving their life. And while 
many may view this as optimistic 
and naive, I believe that some-
times that outlook will keep you 
sane and energetic. The argu-
ment stands that a depressed per-
son may not want to make a 
change, but I find it hard to 
believe that one does not want to 
be happy and does not want to 
live. I think the people who are 
depressed are just comfortable in 
that zone and are afraid of reach-
ing out. In truth, it is breaking

Miniature apartment 
frustrates resident 

Size, maintenance issues are 
hard-to-live-with flaws 

basically 
Carrie Elizabeth Sklar 

F or my column this week, I want to talk about something we all have to deal WI th 
sooner or later: living. I'm nor talk-
ing about that breathing, heart-
pumping bullshit kind of living -
I'm talking about living in an actual 
place of residence. Because chances 
are, even with the economy tn the 
state it's in, you live somewhere. But 
I don't want to talk about where YOll 
live, I want to talk about me. 

I live in a studio apartment. In 
real estate terms, this translates ro 
"I live in a shit-hole." 

Actually, what its suppoud to 
mean is that my bedroom and liv-
ing room have merged into one 
glorious room of convenience and 
economy, but let's be honest With 
each other: It means shit-hole. 

When you walk into my apart-
ment, one of the first things you'll 
notice is my bed. Despite the fact 
that my apartment is the size of a sar-
dine can, I have a queen-size bed. 
And before you even think It, that 
was not my own bright idea. The bed 
came with the apartment, probably 
because the walls were bwlt around 
it - then the contractor realized 

that it was roo big to fit through the 
door so that it can be replaced by a 
more pracocal martress size. 

The re,ult of this madness I~ 
that though three people cannot 
comfortably stand in my livi ng 
room/bedroom/sardine ca n, they 
can all comfortably lie in my bed at 
the same time. (This makes for 
interesting visi ts, I must say.) 

To be fair, my bed is also sup-
posed to be a couch, which I can 
place underneath my desk ro make 
a lot morc room. But thiS maneuver 
requires me to do actual work -
namely, movmg furniture . And If 
anyone thtnks 1 am the ktnd of per .. 
son who actually spends va luable 
energy making her bed into a couch 
just so I have enough room to do a 
pirouette, he or she IS most defi-
nitely insane. (I don't pirouette 
ei ther, so thiS IS really a moot 
point.) 

So anyway, my bed IS huge. I am 
not. Therefore, thiS makes no sense. 

.vIy bed is also one of the most 
noticeable things in my apartment 
because, due to the creative Interior 
decorating of - probably - the 
same moron who thought it was a 
reasonable Size, my bed IS right next 
to the door. If you take one step into 
my apartment and fall Immediately 
to your left, guess where you are? 
That's right : my bed! 

I suppose that thiS really I 
rather practical. I mean, If a rapist

. LEIIER TO THE EDITOR Basically: Peeling paint 
recalls modern artworks 

A.S. Council must better 
defend student parking 
Editor: 

( was very saddened to sec the 
front page article (Feb. 13 issue of 
the Gllm"dian) that parking was 
being slashed by over 1,000 spaces. 
H owever, as I looked at the other 
front-page ar ticle, I understood why 

this has happened and who was to 
blame. The other article ( am refer-
ring to of course is the one about the 
John Muir College Senators con-
ducting some stupid forum that had 
very little to do with parking and a 
lo t to do with nonsense. 

I remember the tudents Fi rst 
slate stati ng that it would fight for 
m ore parking, but this is the second

decides to break into my apart-
ment, ( don't want hlill to halle to 
scrounge around In the da rk look-
ing for my bed. That would prob-
ably pISS him off, and qUIte 
frankly, if I'm gOing to get raped, 
I wou ld prefer that It be by some-
one who is pleasantly surprISed by 
how easily accessible my bed is, 

Another major Issue ( have 
with my apartment is that the 
ceiling peels off. Literally. 

more water waiting to make Its 
great escape. 

So I 'm thinking that lhl~ IS 
really not that bad . ( mean, If I 
have to have a part of my cetltng 
drlppmg water and thrcatentng to 
corne completely off, I should be 
damn grateful that It'S over my 
bathtub. This is really the best 
water-dripping scenario you can 
have. 

Fine, then . I told my manager, 
and sure enough, the ncxt dny, 
maintenance arrived. 

Suicide: Life is valuable, shouldn't be wasted 

Apparently, tho c who have 
inhabited my apartment before 
me all dIsagreed over wha t color 
the ceiling should be, so they all 
painted it different colors. Of 
course, ( normally wouldn't give a 
rat's ass, but since the dl fferent 
layers of paint have started to 
slowly come off (and In patches, 
mInd you), my (elhng look!. like a 
Jackson Pollock palnnng, 

And ( must say, maliltenance 
fixed my cedillg. You know how 
they did It' By taklllg a big chunk 
of my 11'all and putting It over the 
crack In my ceiltng. They moved 
Ihe bolt. (nstead of It bClIlg over 
my head, now the hole IS right III 
front of my fucklllg face when ( 
shower. Granted, there is 110 
water drlPPlllg out of II, but ~tar­
lIlg at spider wcb~ and pipes real-
ly ruins my shower 3mblance, you 
know' 

contin ued from /){Jgr 5 
barricrs and ovcrcoming difficul-
tiCS that define l iving. 

According to Dr. Roben 
Mashman, the clinical director at 
Psychological and Coun cling 
Services, the realiry is that 20 to 30 
percent of people are unhappy and 
do 1101 value life. Whereas you and 
I may get up every morning with a 
huge list of thing to do and a busy 
day ahcJd that wc eagerly take In 
i,tride, olhers wake up belieVing 
that It IS not worth It. They would 
be happlcr dead, and in the end, 
they do not cherish being alive and 
lIlaking their Ii fe worth hving. We 
Jre all o\'crwhdllled wnh ~tre,s, we 
.111 face bouts of depreSSion ,1I1d \lC 
all gel frustrated \lIth life. But I 
c,lnnot accept that ~ome of us have 
(0 chow,e death as an escape roule . 

There dre 2.1,000 ~tudcl\l" at 

UCS D , and next year, stati stically 
spcaking, up to twO of them will 
commit suicide. Statistics show 
that someone commits suicide 
every 18 minutes, and someone 
attempts suicide every 43 econd. 
These figures are absolutely dis-
turbing. Suicide is a tragic public 
health problem, but ( belicve that 
it IS a preventable one nonethe-
Ie s. 

According to /\l ashman, about 
10 people will commit SUICide per 
every 100,000. lIe tried to soothe 
my troubling thoughts by explain-
ing th:1t thiS was a relatively low 
deJth rate. But i~ It' ( thlllk It IS 10 
LOa mallY Thc thought of [\\0 of 
my fellow univerSity cll. mJtes 
resorting to suiCide as a "war out" 
Ic,we;, me dlsgustcd . 

SUllImerfi h', act of SlIlClde left 
me ,1nXIOUS, I recentl}' lost 1 friend 

who had so much to live for, and 
hearing about Summerfish's death 
made me think that she had so 
much to Iille for, too. 1 am con-
cerned for all the people who con-
template suicide because I believe 
it IS not a solution. Maybe each of 
us can try a little harder at being 
more attentive to tho e around us. 
I t Isn 't too much to smile and real-
ly ask how someone is dOing. LIfe 
is an opportuniry, and one has to 
find what they love and Just do It. 
Life IS hurt, and our goal should 
be LO coml(lcr what is prlceles 
:md ~a\'or It. [ mourn the loss of 
SUllImcrfish becJuse ( feel her 
patn, lnd my heJrt reaches out to 
the IJmll) dnd friends she left 
behtnd. ( also pray that more peo-
ple Will choo'>e to hvc than to die 
becau C ulclde ;hould not be an 
optlOIl. 

HAVE FUN: 

But I guess thiS isn't that big a 
deal, either. I mean, I don't really 
look at my ceiling that often, and 
if anyone asks, ( can pretend a 
famous artist friend of mine was 
trymg to "make a statement about 
societal decay." So like my enor-
mous, easy-access bcd, my cClhng 
doesn't really bother me that 
much. -

No, what really bothers me -
what really plsse me off (no pun 
intended) - IS my bathroom. 

A couple weeks ago, I was tak-
Ing a shower. And, like ( normal -
ly do when ( have cleansed myself 
to the best of my ability -I turned 
off the water. • u you can Imagtnc 
my surpnse when I stili felt water 
dripping on my head. And sure 
enough, when I looked up, I saw 
not on I}' a fairly large, dripping 
crack, but al 0 3 large bulge of 
cellll1g where there was clearly 

I like to thmk that maintenance 
wtll eventually come back and 
keep mOVing the hole until It IS 10 
my floor. And SlllCC no one h\'c;,

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Connerly responds to critics with letter 
UC Regent and CRENO author doesn't back off stance 

By ROBERT SALONGA 
Daily Bruin (UCLA) 

(U-\'\ lRF.) L S ANGELE 
- The cOnlro\'ersy over \ Vard 
Connerly's nUllonall\, teleVised 
remarks 'that Ill ' possible to be a 
segregationist and not a raCI t IS 
nOI rCt dead, and neither 
Connerly nor hiS cntlcs are willtng 
to budge. 

Connerly's inteT\~cw on C , j 
With \ Volf Blttzer has drawn fire 
from state legIslators, advocacy 
groups and oldents throughout 
the m\'crslt}' of Caltforma, 
where Connerl\, Its on the Board 
of Regents . . 

In "the Intcr.,e\\', Connerl), s:1Id 
egregatlon does not neces.uril), 

equate to racl m. He \la, referring 
to en . Trent Lott's comment.> 10 
December 200~ that eemed to 
support en. trom Thurl1lond'~ 
19-1 segregationist presidentIal 
campaign. For Lott, the pohocal 
fallout led to the MISSISSIppI 
pohticlan' resignatton as en,He 
maJont) leader. 

For Connerl\', on the o ther 
hand, hI> commc~ ts havc attracted 
the Ire of th~ l 'C Student 
\""CIJtHlI1 andl6 DCmOCrJ tK 

state legislators who wTote a letter 
aslang the Board of Regents to 
repnmand him . 

onnerl}' continues to stand by 
what he saId on CNN, despite the 
leglslatl\'e letter and UCSNs con-
stant demands for hIS apology. llut 
the negative attenuon and accusa-
oons of racism to\\'ard Connerly 
prompted hi m to wri tc a letter of 
hi, o\\'n to Board of Regents 
Chairman John Moores in larc 
January, formally defending his 
actIOn . 

"\\Then someone makes some 
son of accu a lion a bOllt you 
regardmg race 10 thIS nauon, you 
cannot afford to remain ilent," 
Connerly said. "You have to 
respond to correct the record." 

In his letter, Connerly wrote 
how the term "segregaooni tn is 
narrowly limited to the segrega-
oon of blacks in pubhc and private 
facilities prior to the Cil;1 Right 
movement. 

He argued tha t the concept 
could apply to other Clrcum-
,tances, lISll1g the stJtc', Lanno 
legl,latl\,c caucu, and Idenury-
bJ cd group at Unl\"cr,It)· C3m-
puse, a~ examples. 

"These art.! furms 01 ,c~rcgJ-

tion," Connerl), said. " I don't favor 
them, but I'm not goi ng to call 
them racist." 

Some at UCLA did not see cye-
to-eye with Connerl}' on his inter-
pretation of egregation. 

"That is a shallow comment," 
said Alohammad Mertaban, presi-
dent of the Muslim tudent 
AsSOCiation at UCLA. "A lot of 
IInilar struggle unite people, and 

there' a need for a safe environ-
ment on campus. Groups c reate 
unity, not di,unity." . 

State Assemhl}'man Dario 
Frommer (D-Glendale), one of the 
ignalOries of the legislative letter, 
aId Connerly I "lrying to get off a 

noose he;' tied for himself." 
"10 tWISt thiS into freedom of 

a ociation is ridiculou ," 
Frommer said. 

onnerly's nearly nearly 10 
years as a Regent, have been filled 
with controversy about whether 
he's been USlOg his position wilh in 
the Board of Regents to further his 
other ideological pursuIts. 

In 1995, he led the effort to 
pas, Standmg Pohcles I and 2, 
poltcles that ellmrnated the use of 
r,lce and gender preferences rn 
unlver.lty JdmlsslOns and hlnng. 

One year later, he successfully 
spearheaded the passage of 
Proposition 209, a ballot measure 
that banned the use of affirmative 
action in hiring and contracting by 
all state agencies. onnerly the n 
worked to pass imilar measures in 
other states. 

His most recent project is dIe 
Classification of Race, Ethnicity 
and ational Origin initiative, a 
March 2004 ballot measure that 
would ban the co ll ec tion and 
maintaining of any race-based data 
by the state. 

These efforts, ome say, have 
unfairly pegged Connerly, who i 
black, as being against increasing 
the number of people from under-
represented populations rn college 
and in top employment posilions. 

"[Connerly] is not a racist per-
son," said David Benjamin, who 
runs the Irv ine-based te t prep 
company Head of the Class and 
has ho unded th e Univer ity of 
California in the past to adjust its 
admissions and standardized te t-
109 policies. 

"People usc that term tOO easi-
ly," he said. "If you're agarnst affir-
mattve action, some say you're 
racist ."

David Galvan, a member of the

Ligot-Gordon saw a paradox 
between Connerly's post as a Regent

Ligot-Gordon also asserted that

state to respond to demographic 
shifts and changes in constiruent

immigration laws tha t decide "how

Poetry gatherings across the nation speak out 
against the war with Iraq 

W illiam Wordsworth once said that poetry is "the spontaneous 
()vf' r flow n f P A U',. .. ;,.) f(. ~~lil"ll' <:: tt 
Such a flow of feelings was pre-
scnt Jt the Price Center on the 
National Day of Poetry Against 
the \Var on Feb. 12, when a 
group of U D professors and 
students recited and listened to 
poerry as a political statement 
agalll t the Bush administra tion's 
rally for war in Iraq. 

This past January, First Lady 
Laura Bush invited four poets ro 
tile \ Vhite I louse on Feb. 12 for a 
poetry lunch. At the lunch, the 
poCts were to recite the works of 
Langston Hughes, Emily 
Dickenson, Walt Whitman and 
other grea t American poets . 
Ilowever, Sam Hamill, one of the 
invited poets, decided ro use the 
event as an opportunity to voice 
opposition to the war. Hamill 
sent out a letter to some friends, 
in which he asked "every poet to 
speak up for the conscience of 
our country and lend his or her 
name to our petition against this 
war, and to make Feb. 12 a day of 
Poetry Agai nst the War." 
Thousands of people responded 
and submitted poems that were 
to be read at the poetry lunch at 
the White House. 

When Laura Bush received 
word of the idea, she canceled 
the event. In response, groups 
across the nation organized 
poetry readings at unrversities, 
bookstores and coffeehouses on 
Feb. 12 to express anti-war sen-
timents. 

A diverse selcction of works 
from American, Arab and Middle 
Eastern poets were recited at the 
Price Center. The poems were 
researched and submitted to the 
prof.:ssors who were present for 
the reading. The variety of cul -
rure, allowed the audience to 
hear the perspectives of those In 
the Middle E.ast. 

"With poetry, you can hear 
voices of the people who are

Sam Hamill: After the 'MIite 
House poetry event was cancelled,

poems opposing military actIon 
against Iraq. Expecting 50 responses, 
he's gotten 10,000. 

going to be suffering much of 
the destruction that the Bush 
administration is going to lake 
on the entire region: said 
Roddy Reid, a professor of cul-
rural srudies and French srudies 
at UCSD. "That's why we read 
many Iraqi poets, Palestinian 
poets and I raeli poets, and so 
on. We can hear their voices and 
their experiences." 

Bill Mohr, a graduate srudenr 
In the Ph .D. program In litera -
rurc , agreed with Reid in empha-
SIzi ng the existence of other cul-
rures. I Ie warned against turning 
Iraq into orne kind of abstrac-
tion for bombing. 

"It's especially important 
iJccause America has a hi tory of 
imagining that those we make 
war on have no culture," Mohr 
said. "Wi th this, we're trying to 
not have to wait until we destroy 
a country to discover that Iraq 
ha enormou numbers of poetic 
people who speak in a very pro-
found manner." 

The themes that were pre-
eoted at the reading ranged 

from war to cultural lues, [0 
government and poliocs. Alway<;

Ing, the Ifn e~ rh :u \H' r c r rC ItCOl ) 
·poke our on a ' ·arret)' of per-
spectives. 

Part of a poem utled" olos 
on the Oud," by 3aldi Youssef, a 
Moroccan poet, said: "Country 
where I no longer live, / my out-

ca~t country, / from you I only 
gamed a traveler's ads, / a ban-
ner rrpped by daggers / and fugi-
uve stars." 

AJ10ther poem, "The Peace 
allle," by Yasmine Gooneratne, 

ended With the lines, "We called 
the entertainment 'Peace'/ or 
'War' l can't remember which ." 

Ilamill felt that a poetry 
movement similar to the one 
that had spoken out against the 
Vietnam War was a good 
response ro the attacks on Iraq. 
During the lemam War, poetry 
from both the Vietnamese and 
the Americans were documented 
and later published in anti-war 
anthologies. 

"Poetry wa the major an 
form used to protest the 
Vietnam War and the American 
involvement [in it)''' Mohr said. 

Currently, over 5,300 poems 
and personal statement have 
been submitted to Hamill's call, 
and these have been po ted on 
hrrp:lllJfWW.pottsagaillmhtwar.org. 
The overwhelming number of 
works that have been received i 
a reminder on the impact perry 
can have on social movements. 

"People always go out and ay 
tupid things like, ' Is poetry 

politica l?' It's like asking, 'Is 
poetry sports?' It' sort of like 
whatever you want it to be," aid 
Eileen Nylel, a professor of Writ-
ing at UCSD who played a

Humanities lectures captivate 
Lecture series to discuss arts and letters 

By ANNE CONG-HUYEN 
Senior Staff Writer 

At 3 school notorious for its 
sciences and research, the human-
ities are often forgotten . Perhaps 
many people assume that the 
humanities here at CSD are not 
very prestigious. or many people 
don't realize that the humanities 
and the sCiences can actually 
relate. But whatever the reason, 
the CSD Center for the 
I !umanities is trying 10 cha nge 
that. 

According to Georgios 
Anagnostopoulo , dlrcctor of the 
humani ties program, the goal of 
the center IS "to support the 
research of faculty and graduate 
srudents in the division of arts and 
humanities, which is cOlllpri~cd of 
SIX departments: history, litera -
ture. philosophy, music, theatre 
and dance, visual arts, and other 
interdisciplinary program. So the 
center, for example, financially 
supports the research of faculty 
and awards a number of fellow-
ships per year to assist graduate 
students to fil1lsh thelT disserta-
tions. r t funds can ferences, col-
laborative research, some support 
for enriching the education of 
graduate students, and In the 
future, perhaps there may be ci r-
cumstances to involve undergrad-
uates in some activities." 

One way that the center edu-
cates UC 0 students and the San 
Diego communlry IS through a 
new lecture senes titled " .. . 
Continuing the DIalogue ... " 
This series features Icctures on 
various tOpics given by professors 
in all UCSD departments, as well 
as others.

humanities to the general public 
and to engage in the dialogue with 
all the other divisions on the cam-
pus, like the social sciences or the 
medical school," said 
Anagnostopoulos about the role of 
the lecture series in the goal of the 
center. 

Although the center is an 
endowment for the humani ties, 
one of its main functions is to 
educate the public about the 
importance and interrelatedness 
of the humanitic with other pop-
ular areas of study, such as neuro-
science, biology or 
oceanography. 

OnJan. 15, literature professor 
Ron Berman held a captivating 
lecrure about the letters of F.

The UCSD enter for 
Humanities is in the process of 
organizing more lectures like this 
one, and it is trying to get morc 
stud ents and community members 
to attend . 

With the linllted funds it has 
been allotted and an almost 
unrecognized presence on cam-

been able to raise money and

Adolc cence and the devclop-
mem of individual sexual idefltity 
are not eas)' for many people. 
However, this process can become 
even more complicated for those 
who find themselves in the lesbian, 
gay, bisexual and transgender com-
munity. Many question can arise 
around the subject of coming out 
to friends and family and the effect 
this will have on their live. The 
national organization Parent, 
Familie and Friends of Lesbians 
and Gays was developed ro provide 
support for those who find them-
clve in this situation. 

Thi year, the San Diego PFLAG 
is offering three $1 ,000 scholarships 
to lesbian, gay. transgender or bisex-
ual students who currently attend a 
post-secondary school instinltion or 
plan to in the fall of 2003 . 
cholarshlps \\~ll be awarded based 

on participation in leadership in 
community actiVities, determination 
and potenoal ro achieve goals and 
demonstration of financial need. 

These cholarships, the David 
Birnbaum Memorial cholarship, 
the John Bessemer 1emorial 
cholarship and the Mary Wagner 

,'Iemorial Scholarship, are awarded 
[0 full-lime snldents for one acade-
nuc year. To apply, one must ~ub­

PFLAG's mission statement 
affirms, "PFLAG promotes the 
health and well-being of gay, les-
bian, bisexual and trans gender per-
sons, their families and friends 
through support, to cope with an 
adverse society; education, to 
enlighten an ill-informed public; 
and advocacy, to end discrimina-
tion and to secure equal civil 
rights." 

" Many parents of kids just 
coming out find comfort 

... with other parents who 
have 'been there, done 

that' and are alive, happy 
and. weU." 

- Olivia Dorman, seaetary of 
san Diego PFLAG 

The PFLAC organization's pur-
pose IS "threefold: It supports fam-
ilies, friends and gay persons as 
they share concerns and seek com-
forr and affirmation. It educa tes the 
public to help It gain an under-
standing of gay persons, and it 
ad"ocates for gay nghts," said 
011',3 Dorman, secretary of the 
San Diego County PFLA J . 

One of Idst year's winners was 
CSD student Diana Chase. 
"We hope that cholarship win-

ners will complete their education.

contribute positively to tlle com-
munity while imultaneously serv-
ing as role models and perhaps 
activists for the LGBT communi-
ty," Dorman said. 

The San Diego Branch, found-
ed in 1982, holds monthly meet-
ings in Carlsbad and San Diego. 
These meetings offer a safe and 
supportive place for friends. par-
ents and members of the LG BT 
community to share their experi-
ences. At these confidential meet-
ings, many people hare thclr S[Q-
ries and feci a com III on bond with 
others in attendance who have 

e~perienced many of the ame tri-
als. 

"Parents can help their gay child 
by worlcing out the parents' own 
fears and conce rns about their 
LGBT daughter or son. Many par-
ents of lcids JUSt COl1lll1g out find 
comfort in meeting and talking 
with other parents who havc 'been 
there, done that,' and arc alive,

Few hook rcviews manage to

Oates without mentioning her rep-
utation as the most prolific writer 
of her generation. It's an estima-
tion that's both widely held and 
di fficult to mcTlt over any extended 
period of time . Oates' newest 
offering, "I'll Take

tainly capable of win-

its slatus as the most 
recent in a long line

and a a spectacular

Oates: New novel includes 
refreshing characterization 

continued from page 15 
inepOless or Anellia invokes a fan -
tastic range of emotions, among 
them guilt for not reaching out to 
the kid no one liked in school. 
Vernor's character is no less vivid, 
es tablishing himself as a com-

" 

Anellia and the people around her 
- her classmates, her sorority sis-
ters, her family and her lover -
that is contrasted with the intima-
cy between the reader and the 
main character. 

"I'll Take You There" is not so 
much a coming-of-pelling and at rimes 

despicable pres-
ence. Even the bir 
part of sorority 
hou se- moth e r 
Agnes Thayer con-
tains a characteri-
zation that is 
refreshingly [hree-
di mensional and 
poignant. 

The intensely han' 
est first,persan nar, 
mtive is utterly cap, 

age story as a por-
trait of a young 
woman constantly 
surprised to dis-
cover the strength 
of simply endur-
ing. The discovery 
Anellia makes is 
one of identity, but 
it is also one of 
finding power, 
finding a voice, 

Perhaps one of 
Ihe most intrigu-
ing deVices that 
Dales employs in 

tivating and 
remarkably gritty . Il 

" ['II ' lake YOli There" is her tellar 
use of interior monologue. The 
intensely honest first-person nar-
rative is utterly captivating and 
remarkably gritty. There is a care-
fully kept distance between 

finding a way to 
make It from one 

day to the next. It is a lengthy look 
at the difficulty of young adulthood 
and a tribule to anyone who has 
ever had to find acceptance, not 
only among others, but more 
importantly, within oneself.

UCSD splits doubleheader 
against Stanislaus on weekend 

Bland improves record to 4, 1 on 
sea n with win for Tritons ftba ll 

By JOE SPANO 
Staff Writer 

T he Tritons got off to a rocky 
starr againSt CSU Stanislaus on Feb. 
15, losing the first gamc of their 
doubleheader 10-4, but quickly 
bouncing back to take the second 
ga me in a 2 - I victory. 

Everything started off wcll for 
the Tritons, who jumped out to a 2-
I lead after the first inning and 
extended that lead to 3- 1 aftcr the 
second inning. Things continued to 
go the Tritons' way throughout the 
firs t four innings, at LIlc end of 
which they led the Warriors by a 
score of 3-2 . 

Things quickly ruIned sour for 
UCSO in the fifth inning when 
starting sophomore pitcher Keri 
Hanley had trouble facing the first 
three batters. At this point, junior 
Jodie Bland was called in for relief. 

tanislaus proceeded to score seven 
runs in thc fifth inning, puning the 
game out of reach for the 'Ti-itons at 
9-3. Hanley was credited with ule 
loss, which bnngs her record to 3-3. 

The Warriors added an insur-
ance run in the sixth, and UCSD 
starred a comeback in the seventh, 
but was only able to produce one 
run, making it a 10-4 loss. 

"Our communication just fell 
apart in [the fifth] inning," said 
Triton head coach Patti Gerckcns. 
uThey had some hits, but we had a 
lot of mcmallapses. "Vc're going to 
take that and learn from it." 

The first game was not withollt 
positives, however, especially at the 
plate. J urn or Kim Aggabao contin-
ued to knock in the runs, adding two 
RBIs to her team-leading total while 
also going 2-for-4 with a run . 
Sophomore Breanne Cope went 2-

for-3, while sophomorcJamie Ilurst 
and freshmanJcnmfer Leonard each 
addcd an RBI for the ·lrilOnS. 

' nle second game started off in 
mllch the same fashion as the first, 
with UC D scoring once in the sec-
ond inning and leading 2- 1 after the 
third inning. T hat score wOllld qick 
for the rest of the game. Bbnd threw 
a complete g-ame, with the victory 
bringing her record to 4-1 on ule 
season. 

"We came back WiUI a lot of 
heart and a lot of guts 111 the second 
game," Gerckens s.ud. ""Ve couJd 
have gwen up, but we fought back 
and won." 

Junior Amy Mettce provided the 
offensi ve park for the Tnrons, 
going 2-for-3 and scoring one of the 
twO runs. Freshman iki Anderson 
scored the sct'Ond run , whde Cope 
had the sole RBI of the game, the 
other run coring off an error. 

The li-Itons made good use of an 
aggressivc offensivc bunting strate-
gy, coupled with strong basenmning 
in the second g"dlllC that was cructal 
to their VIctory. 

"We had a lot of key bunts in the 
second game," Gerckens said. 

One of UC 0' big problems 
this weekend was the nUl1lber of 
runners left on base. Gf'rckens noted 
that the ream needed to work on this 
after leaving seven runners on 111 ule 
first game and nine in the second. 

The Tritons overall record IS 
now 7-4, 3-3 in the Ca lifornia 
Collegiate Athletic Association, 
which placcs them III a tie for fifth 
place with al State San Bernardino. 
UCSO's next game takes place on 
the road on Feb. 21 against nOIl -
conference opponent Azusa PaCific 
University, followed by CSU SJI1 
Bernardino on Feb. 22.

continued from fJOte 20

tone for Tiger's fi rst round, which 
was cut short due to rain. He fi n-
ished the last nine holes of his first

ly unhappy when he stormed

T he typical La Jolla weather 
finally showed up by the time 
Woods stepped up to the lOth tee 
of the South Course, where he 
began his second round at 10;57 
a.m. The sun dried the muddy 
course and provided fans and 
golfers with plenty of the spectacu-
lar views that Torrey Pines is 
known for. It also seemed to warm 
up Tiger, who jumped lip the 
leaderboard with a round of 6-
under-par 66. 

His second round ended on the 
613-yard, par-5 No. 9 of the 
South Course. He hit a good tee 
shot to the center of the fairway, 
and then ripped a 3-wood that 
stopped 10 yards short of the 
front of the green and 25 yards 
shon of the pin, which was tucked 
into the back-left corner of the 
uphi ll putting surface . Woods' 
pitch took two small bounces on 
the green and then rolled right 
into the cup for an eagle, a strong 
fi nish to a day in which he played 

27 holes. It was a major confi-
dence-booster. 

uAfter a long day, it felt good 
to end on that note ... If I can get 
the ball in play, it felt like I can do 
pretty well from there: Woods 
said. 

On Feb. 15, Woods got off to a 
quick stan, birdying the first two 
holes and bringing him within one 
of the leader. He would pick up 
another birdie on the par-5 No.6 
after his drive landed in a fairway 
bunker. From there, he picked his 
ball cleanly with his 3-wood and 
put it on the green, where he two-
putted for a birdie. 

He continued through his third 
round, scrambling to save pars, until 
he found himself tied for the lead 
going into his final hole of the day; 
the par-5 18th. After a drive that was 
crushed and put into the center of 
the fairway, Woods tried to assure 
himself of the outright lead and a 
spot in the final group when he 
went for the green on his second 
shot. From 289 yards away, Woods 
hit a 3-wood that went right and hit 
the 5 -year-old son of fonner San 
Diego Charger Rolf Benirschke in a 
corporate tent that lined the east 
side of the green. After taking his 
free drop, Woods nopped his ball 
Onto the green, where he made his 
putt for birdie and walked off the 
course with a one-shot lead.

Men's volleyball loses to UOP, Stanford 
Tritons still looking for their first MPSF victory 

By BRYCE WAIWICK 
Senior Staff Writer 

Despire some shake-ups in its 
lineup, the UCSD men's volley-
ball team remains winless in the 
Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation after a pair of road 
losses against University of the 
Pacific and Stanford University. 

In Stockton, Calif., on Feb. 14, 
the Tritons entered the match 
against UOP with hopes of upset-
ting the ninth-ranked Tigers, but 
despite a strong start, UCSO .,.,as 
swept in three games (30-27, 30-
26, 30-24). 

In game one, the Tritons out-
hit the Tigers .394 to .37 1, but 
could not come up with the victo-
ry, falling snort by three points. 
UCSD's attack percentage deflat-
ed to .125 in the second game, but 
UOP elevated its efficiency, hit-
ting .425 to take the second game 
easily. 

Mter a long string of frustra-
tions, Triton head coach Ron 
Larsen shi fted setter Eric Perrine 
to outside hitter and brought 
junior Tye Thoreson in to set. 
The switch did not yield immedi-
ate results and the Tigers rolled to 
the sweep. 

Jim Waller led UCSO with 12 
kills, Perrine and Thoreson com-
bined for 47 assists, and libero 
Chris Mortimer paced the 

defense with a match-high 15 
digs. 

Mortimer commented later 
about the frustrations of the 
recent Tritons' play and the famil-
iarity of the siruation in which 
UCSO found itself. 

"It's felt the same the last few 
matches we lost, especially against 
BYU, where we're playing really 
well for periods of times during 
games - we're just not able to 
extend that over the course of a 
competitive match," he said. 

The following night, the 
Tritons suffered from more of the 
sam'! against Stanford. Despite the 
absence of the Cardinals' 2002 
All-American opposite Curt 
Toppel, Stanford had more than 
enough firepower to take care of 
UCSO. 

The Cardinals started quickly 
and sprinted out to an early lead. 
David Vogel put down back-to-
bade kills to stretch the lead to 13-
7; after that, Stanford didn 't look 
back, going on to a 30-24 victory. 

The Tritons were far more 
offensively competitive in game 
two, with Thoreson doing the set-
ting for the match and picking up 
19 kills. That would not be 
enough, however, since Stanford 
squee7.ed Out a 34-32 win. 

Down 2-0, and after losing a 
tough game, UCSO could have 
quit, but instead fought back
