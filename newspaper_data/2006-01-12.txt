Laser Technique 
Exposes Blood Clots 

A new technique developed 
by UCSD researchers that cre-
ates and image blood clots in 
the brain ould make it possible 
to under tand small strokes that 
are implicat d in many forms of 
dem ntia, includi ng Alzheimer's 
disea e. 

The study, published this 
week in the on line version of 
the journal Public Library of 
Science Biology, represents a 
co llabora tion betNeen the 
research groups of physics 
professor David Kleinfeld and 
neurosc iences professor Patrick 
Lyden . The printed version of 
the study will appear in the 
February issue of the journal. 

The researchers we re able to 
monitor the cha nges in blood 
flow using a laser to trigger the 
formation of blood clots in the 
bra ins of anesthetized rats. 

"Joining forces allowed us to 
c rack a puzz le that either one of 
us couldn 't c rack a lone," Lyden 
stated. 

They say that this technique 
provides a way to understand 
small strokes that are common 
in e lderly people. 

· Our technique makes it pos-
sible, for the first time, to pre-
cisely target individual blood 
vessels to c reate a blood clot 
while ca usi ng very little collat-
eral damage," Kleinfeld stated 
in a press release. "We can then 
follow, in real time, the cha nges 
in blood flow in surrounding 
vessels that 0 cur as a result of 
the formatio n of a clot in one 
small artery of the brain ." 

Kleinfeld and Lyden credited 
the discovery to collaboration 
a ross traditional discip lines. 

"Pat and I are coming from 
different worlds, but we had the 
same question at the back of 
our minds,· said Kleinfeld .

Porn, Special Election Take 
Spotlight at A.S. Meeting . 

Two Applied for Manager Position 

As most expected - and a few probably hoped - prepara-tion for the special election 
that will take place in two weeks 
stood as the biggest item on the A.S. 
Council's to-do list on Jan. 11. The 
election, which will decide whether 
or not to override the council's deci-
sion to ban pornographic material 
from Student-Run Television, has 
been bitterly contested by both sides 

the election bylaws proved to be 
a bit more difficult than submitter 
A.S. Vice Preslde.nt of Academic 
Affairs Harry Khanna appeared to 
anticipate. 

Although there was only one vote 
against the c!-tanges in internal com-
mittee, several senators proposed 
their own amendment to Khanna's 
bill, stalling the process. Thurgood 
Marshall College Senior Senator 

Kate PllIon's 
alterations to 

New Khanna's bill 
Business 

included creating 
an earlier dead-
line that would 

for months. This 
meeting featured 
the approval of 
the new special 
elections manag-
er, who will over· 
see the election, 
and slight revi-
sions of the A.S. 
election bylaws,

ute tinkering with

though councilmembers voted down 
several additional bylaw changes. 

protect the A.S. 
Council from appearing "shady" in 
the eyes of the public. 

Pillon's amendments were 
approved 17-2-2, in a discussion 
where the word "shady· was used at 
least six more times. 

One proposed, but rejected, 
amendment came from Sixth College 

~enlor Senator Matt Corrales, who 
suggested the council change the 
description of the elections manager 
from "he or she" to "that person." 

• ELECTION, from page 1 
er position did not receive many 
applicants, with Gupta being the 
only eligible candidate to apply for 
the position. 

"There was one other person to 
apply, but it was a councilmember, 
so I had to withdraw their applica-
tion," Sweeten said. 

Nevertheless, the position 
entails a large amount of responsi-
bility, according to Spears. 

While Gupta admits that his 
experience with elections is lim-
ited. he believes that his involvement 
with campus groups such as the 
Inter-College Residents' Association 
will help him in his task. 

"The office of elections Manager 
is extremely demanding," Spears 
said. "I have a great respect for 
anyone that has that [job) . A lot of 
people aren't going to like the offi-
cer, and he or she needs al1 the help 
they can get." 

Controversy over the election 
is still brewing, with John Muir 
College senior Daniel Watts pub-
lishing - with student activity fees 
- a newspaper accusing specific 
A.S. Council senators of mislead-
ing constituents in the events that 
led to the shutdown of SRTV and 
misappropriating student funds. 

"I published [The Truth About 
UCSD') to give everyone else on 
campus a chance to know what's 

going on," Watts said. "Students 
can't judge the issues unless they 
see them in context . This is a sup-
plement to everything else already 
published in its own context." 

Watts explicitly targeted Sixth 
College Senior Senator Matt 
Corrales in the publication, which 
alleged that the councilmember 
rigged "the wording of the [special 
election) ballot to make sure the 
A.S. Council would prevail." 

Corrales, however, refutes the 

was one other 
person to apply, but 

it was a council mem-
ber, so I had to 
withdraw their 
application." 

- Christopher Sweeten, President, 
A.S. Counci l 

charges. 
"While every student has the 

right to know what's going on with 
A.S., my opinion hadn't been for-
mulated yet;' he said. "I ultimately 
drafted the question for the special 
election, and even [Watts) agreed 

with the final baUot wording at the 
Nov. 30 meeting." 

Revelle College Sophomore 
Senator Dan Florek, another tar-
get of Watts' paper, denies that 
.criticisms of the special election 
were based on personal motives, 
but rather a belief that he was act-
ing on the will of the students who 
elected him. 

"Watts made play of my state· 
ment that the A.S. Council's deci· 
sions were right for the student 
body," he said. "' believe that our 
decisions are right for the studen\s 
only if the students say so. My 
point, however, was to say that 
students need to--be educated on 
both sides of the issue before they 
can make an informed vote. The 
fact is that most students have not 
yet heard the side of the issue that 
pornography should not be aired 
on STRV." 

Although the fron t page of 
Watts' publicalion states that the 
content is meant to be satirical, 
Watts claims that the majority of 
his allegations are based in truth. 

"It's a tabloid, from the sensa-
tionalized headlines to the satirical 
photo captions," Watts said. "Like 
tabloids, it's based in fact , but it 's 
also sat irical." 

Readers can contact Matt L'Heureux 
at mlheureu@ucsd.edu. 

John Muir College junior Puneet 
Gupta was appointed as the spe-
cial elections manager in an unan-
imous vote following a question-
and·answer session that explored his 
qualifications, experience dealing 
with pressure and media scrutiny 
and Gupta's likelihood to follow his 
predecessor, Muir alumnus Steve 
York, into the adult ftJm industry. 
Also, the issue of neutrality came 
into play, with Gupta asserting that 
" I have no set opinion on the issue. 
, don't intend to let bias interfere 
because there i.s no bias." 

When asked by Muir College 
Council Chair Neil Spears why he 
wanted to be the special elections 
manager, Gupta responded . "I felt at 
the time that it was a serious issue 
t hat needed to be dealt with fairly." 
Ultimately, the council agreed with 
Gupta's qualifications and methods, 
approving his nomination by con-
sensus with applause. 

"' think it's a shame our elec-
tions bylaws aren't gender neutral ," 
Corrales said. 

When that comment was met 
with confused stares, Spears broke 
the silence. 

"[ just don't understand what you 
mean," he said. 

Take a shot at being a 
photographer! 

The approval of the changes to 

"Some people don't identify as 
either male or female," Corrales 
responded. 

However, the change did not 
appear to be a priority of the coun-
cil, which voted down the proposal 
1- 13·5, with Corrales the only vote 
in favor of approval.

HITTING AMERICA WHERE IT HURTS By Ashley Green

The Next Decade Will Be Crucial in 
Establishing a Campus Character 

By David Cerutti 
STAFF WRITER 

T Wo and a half years ago, when I watched the watermelon plunge to its much-anticipated demise, chucked gently by a male Watermelon 
Queen sporting pieces of rind in critical places, it 
dawned on me that this was the most UCSD students 
I ever saw congregate for an event that was unmistak-
ably coUegiate. And so it was, the next year and the 
one after that. 

A distinctive campus spirit at UCSD is possibly the 
most significant deficit this powerful research uni-
versity faces. Like the ideal young minds that attend, 
the character of UCSD is itself a tabula rasa. The next 
10 years will reveal whether UCSD is prepared for 

One inexpensive measure would be to restructure 
college governments and bolster their coffers. At 
Rice, each of the nine residential colleges consisted of 
roughly 300 students. Their operating budgets, rough-
ly $35,000 per annum, each paid for at least two major 
parties, annual theater productions, weekly meetings 
of the governing body, special occasions for seniors 
as well as underclassmen, service projects, freshman 
orientation, study breaks and the most significant 
campus event, "Beer Bike" (Google that - you are 
feeling lucky). 

The sarpe formula is largely in place at UCSO's 
residl\lltial colleges, with some significant differences . 
John Muir College, for example, occasionally sends 
students on day or weekrnd skiing and theme-park 
trips. When aIL UCSD colleges are larger than the 

nine colleges of Rice combined, it cultivation or devoid of pride and 
spirit for want of the proper infra-
structure. 

This past fall, the Undergraduate 
Student Experience and Satisfaction 
Committee suggested a number 
of improvements (their report is 
available at http://studentresearch. 
ucsd.edulsatisfaction/). As exten-
sive as the list is, however, it tends 
to linearize the problem, placing 
things with vastly different costs 
quaintly, albeit in some order, on 
the same scale. Rather, there is one 
very expensive project that UCSD 
must complete over many years 
and a variety of inexpensive rear-
rangements that it can complete 
immediately.

UCSD is possibly 

becomes economical to do bigger 
things; however, relatively expen-
sive trips that send students off 
campus should be weighed against 
activities on campus that every stu-
dent could potentially attend. 

Another bargain fIX would be to 
restructure freshman orientation. 
This is not something that should 
take place during a weekend in the 
middle of the summer - the intro-

housing J 240 students, is a step 
in this direction, but only if the

portion to the student population. 

rasa." 

At Rice, freshman orientation 
is a wee.k-Iong event that takes 
place immediately before the aca-
demic year, permitting freshmen 
to fraternize before upperclassmen 
and problem sets descend upon 
them. Aside from the bare-bones 
information sessions provided by 
UCSD colleges, Rice University's 
·O-week" provides time for fresh -
man to meet their college masters, 
talk with student mentors to plan 
their first semester, and experience 
mild forms of hazing. 

Sophomores, seniors and, most importantly, juniors 
have to be kept on campus in order to create a mature 
academic culture. 

In creating a single, large public space in the new 
ERC apartments, architect Moshe Safdie' has in fact 
provided the college residence with an ideal place for 
community events and college functions. This is pre-
cisely the plan of all nine colleges at my alma mater, 
Rice University, and an achievement for its $106 mil-
lion cost (while I was there, Rice spent $60 million to · 
build an equivalent outfit for 320 students) . 

Like stem cell therapies on the horizon, students 
must be coaxed to adhere and flourish in places that 
make our SOciety healthy - this would be expensive, 
but a real bargain compared to the $3 billion Gov. 
Schwarzenegger helped procure for my metaphor's 
inspiration. The one-time investment in housing 
would likely also be a minor expense compared to the 
annual buckets of financial aid - needed as they are 
- that the university expends. 

The faculty masters are gener-
ally aware of what is taking place, but the atmosphere 
remains safe because alcohol is strictly prohibited dur-
ing O-week. College masters participate with students 
to plan events for the incoming freshmen, but rarely 
have to rule: Playboys and partiers get balanced out 
by mother hens and achievers, and problem themes 
such 85 "Home DepO-week" (when freshmen might 
get "hammered" and "nailed") are often tossed out by 
students before the masters have to step in. 

Alcohol and drugs are a darker facet of campus 
spirit. The president's office at Rice frequently defends 
its · wet -campus" policy against angry parents who 
want the university to enforce morality when they are 
no longer able. There's no way to put a price tag on 
any changes to the current UCSD policy. However, 
there are a lot of points in the Rice policy that con-
trast favorably to that of UCSD. Rice police assured 
the stu4ents during O-week and at other times of two

and impedes their progress if they 
get in. A distinctive character on 
campus outshines social differences, 
advancing productive enthusiasm 
over established fortune. Campus 
spirit is a strong indicator of UCSD's 
commitment to building a society 
based on merit rather than birth-
right, and therefore an indicator of 
its service to America.

of Corporate Culture Has Finally Commenced 

D id you get sodomized every time you bought a piece of mainstream media?

way over a dollar a song) only to 
find 5 skits, 3 interludes, 8 snom:-

us. Student-age consumers gener-
ate the demand that drives the 
ongoing rise of portable, digital 
distraction, the devices that many 
experts describe as the hangman

able) media. Assuming you don't

probably lugging 
multiple hundreds 
of dollars in com-
puterized gizmos 
(call 'em what you 
will) around cam-buster with a 

plot thinner than Michael Jackson's 
nose? 

You're nodding . It probably 
even happened last week (except 
not at the Wherehouse, sniff sniff.) 

Dry your eyes. These days, you 
can take it (up the ... ) with a smile 
- a real one, I mean. If Culture 
2005 proved one thing, it's that 
we're officially beginning to get 
revenge for all the juice and jangle 
that's been sucked out of us by the 
big boys. We helpless consumers of 
media are at the top of a big, long 
hill, znd the ride down - on the 
backs of the major media corpora-
tions - is going to be sweeter than 
Mariah Carey's sauteed shitpipe. 

Just look at the hard num-
bers that have industry executives 
screeching Armageddon: Domestic 
box-office returns are down for 
their third -straight year. Home 
video sales dipped for the first 
time in 25 years. Music album sales 
fell 7 percent, and even if you count 
to song downloads as an album, 
music sales still fell 4 percent. 

Ready. Set. Ouch. (Did you just 
hear a blood-curdling scream?) 

We college students ought to 
know better than anyone who's to 

pus, most of which are far more 
entertaining than a biochemistry 
lecture, or, for that matter, "Get 
Rich or Die Tryin." 

Your iPod doesn't care if you 
heard - or bought - the floozy 
tracks on the Game's record (or 
heard the homework assignment). 
So why would you? 

Amazingly, the existence of this 
empowering decision apparently 
hasn't yet appeared in the minds of 
the major culture industry execu-
tives, whose companies are still 
producing stale, mostly vomit-fla-
vored plastic entertainment pack-
ets. 

Consumers, of course, deserve 
some blame here. Call me arro-
gant, overeducated or gay, but I 
couldn't stifle a grim sigh perus-
ing the lists of 2005's top-selling 
media: Star Wars. Mariah Carey. 
Harry Potter. 50 Cent. Tom Cruise. 
Kelly Clarkson. 

Then all of a sudden a startling 
fear hit me. 

What if we're draining the life 
out of our own popular culture? 
What if single track and episode 
downloads are killing arty state-
ments like albums and feature 

films, and encouraging us to fiU 
our iPods with the brainless bus 
ride-killers we secretly enjoy, but 
couldn't previously bring ourselves 
to spend real money on? 

(Then I remembered that most 
people like fun-but-bad media, and 
always have and probably always 
will. Downloading just lets us all 
skip the boring-and -bad parts. 
Grim sigh again and .. . I'm over 
it. ) . 

Anyway, it's also getting hard-
er to tell what's good and what's 
bad. "The 40-Ye'ar-Old Virgin" 
looked like a 13-year-old 's fa re 
in a preview, but try gett ing it 
at Blockbuster for the -first three 
weeks of release. When 1 finally 
obtained a copy, I discovered that 
I loved its subtle charms - those 
so-true monologues on masculin-
ity and the helpful gUide to public 
urination. Awww. 

On the other hand, as a secure, 
self-admitted snob, let me tell you: 
Kelly Clarkson is bad. But at least 
I didn't have to get finanCially 
reamed to find that out. (Instead, 
I got to realize that genuine cranial 
hemorrhaging is only three clicks 
away.) 

This curious power shift is per-
haps the ultimate fleece, turned 
around on the original f1eecers : 

They can give us crap, and we 
might even sometimes like it, but 
we sure as hell ain't going to pay 
their prices for it. 

Not even with 17,000 lawsuits 
out against so-called thieves - the 
amoral users of such sinister file -
sharing applications as Kazaa and 
LimeWire. Note to Industry: We 
know you've sprung more than just 
a minor leak - the whole ark is 
going down in this storm - and 
our ocean sure as hell isn't scared 
of your bucket.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR--
More Effort Needed to 

Curtail Student Tobacco Use 
Dear Editor: 

As reported recently by the Tobacco Free 
Communities Coalition in its grading oflocal 
colleges and universities, UCSD received a 
dismal rating - a "0" grade for its efforts 
and poliCies regarding tobacco regulation. 
Of the list of six San Diego-area four-year 
universities' tobacco policies and practices, 
UCSD ranked at the very bottom, receiving 
the only "I):' 

According to the Center for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly 
40,000 nonsmoking Americans die yearly 
due to exposure to secondhand smoke. For 
a reference point, about 18,000 Americans 
die of AIDS and 17,000 die of homicide 
annually. (t is completely unacceptable that 
such a large number of people who aren't 
even smokers die from exposure (through 
secondhand smoke) to tobacco, which is 
entirely preventable. While the case of those 
who eventually die as a result of expc.sure to 
secondhand smoke is somewhat extreme, it 
has been proven that any exposure to sec-
ondhand smoke is harmful. Smoking is not 
an issue that involves just the smoking indi -
vidual, since it inherently forces others to 
chemically participate in what is a harmful 
activity. Because it is a public health issue, 
where smoking may and may not occur must 
be strictly regulated. Many UCSD students 
can personally attest to times when they've 
been forced to breathe others' secondhand 
smoke as they've walked to or from class, 
eaten or hung out with friends in common 
areas like Price Center, or as they've partici -
pated in other activities on campus. VCSD 
does have the 20-foot law (the state-required 
bare minimum), but even when this rule is 
being observed (wh ich is certai nly not all the 
time), tobacco smoke can still be prevalent 
in far too many places on campus. 

Some other public colleges and universi-
ties in California such as San Francisco State, 
Fresno State and, locally, Miramar College, 
have instituted campuswide smoking bans 
with the . allowance of a handful of outdoor 
areas deSignated as zones where people may 
smoke. UCSD would do well to implement 
such a policy, as it would leave little ambigu-
ity concerning where smoking may occur 
acd would reduce the prevalence of harmful 
secondhand smoke present throughout the 
campus. It is ironic that on an academic level 
UCSD has conSistently produced excellent 
research on the harmful nature and effects 
of tobacco smoke yet as a campus it has 
done a notably poor job in protecting people 
from it. 

Any university that is truly serious about 
the health of its students, faculty, workers 
and guests should be doing the absolute best 
it can in forming its policies and practices 
on tobacco. A "0" grade shows that UCSD is 
currently nowhere near that goal.

UC Student Fees Would 
Have Inflated 8 Percent 
~ BUDGET, from page 1 
plan. 

"This proposal recognizes the 
financial struggles of many California 
families and helps preserve access 
to the university for families of all 
means," UC Pre~ident Robert C. 
Dynes stated in a press release. 

The governor's $125.6 billion 
state-spending plan gives a total of 
$11.2 billion to higher education. 
Overall, UC campuses would receive 
$3.049 billion from the general fund 
under the plan, a 7.3-percent increase 
from last fiscal year. The budget 
would still spend billions more than 
the state would take in, closing the 
gap with unexpected revenue from 
this year, 
according to the Legislative Analyst'S 
Office. 

But Schwarzenegger's plan to use 
state revenue to subsidize UC fees 
would remove predictability from 
future fee levels, according to LAO 
Higher Education Director Steve 
Boilard. 

"Experience over the past few 
decades shows that the state tends 
to lower fees when the state bud-
get starts to improve, but those fees 
increase conSiderably when the state 
budget gets worse." Boilard stated 
in an e-mail. "Many people believe 
that the fee increases are made worse 
because of the need to 'make up' for 
the lost revenue from those times 
fees were decreased. Our office feels 
that student fees should not be yo-
yoing in this way." 

In November, the UC Board of 
Regents approved a $492 fee increase 
from this year, requiring students pay 
a total of$6,633 in mandatory system 
fees. However, the regents also added 
a prOvision that allowed the board 
to annul the hike in the event the 
state provided the funding to do so. 

The board will meet at UCSD this 
month to discuss and update the fee 
levels, which have almost doubled 
since 2000. 

The governor's choice to block 
student fee growth will pay dividends 
for the state, according to Richard 
Stapler, spokesman for state Assembly 
Speaker and ex-oficio Regent Fabian 
Nunez. 
- Nunez persuaded the regents to 
consider rescinding fee increases, 
under the hope that he could push 
Schwarzenegger to buyout the hike 
with state funds, Stapler said. 

"(f there's any factor in this state 
that can equalize, it's education," 
Stapler said. "Putting money into the 
UC is like investment. The university 
is a huge economic generator for the 
state." . 

Lobbying efforts by the UC 
Students Association, which includ-
ed a meeting with Schwarzenegger 
representatives two weeks ago, were 
a major part of the governor's deci-
sion, according to UCSA President 
Anu Joshi. 
. "Hundreds of students traveled 

across the state to fight for affordabil-
ity at the November regents meeting. 
thousands signed postcards sent to 
the Speaker Nunez and hundreds of 
thousands of students and families 
will benefit from their hard work," 
Joshi stated in a press release. "We are 
ecstatic that the governor decided to 
prioritize higher education and take 
the first step in restoring the classic 
legacy of accessibility to higher edu-
cation in California." 

However, the governor's plan 
could hurt accessibility for lower 
income families, according to 
Boilard. In 2004, the LAO published 
a report, which concluded that more

longer be tolerated." 

The UC system, unlike the 
California State University and the 
California community colleges sys-
tem, retains a s~mi-autonomous 
body explicitly protected by the 
state Constitution. Currently, the 
university does not need approval 
from the Legislature or the gover-
nor to set its budget or policy and is 
run by the Board of Regents, which 
is composed of state employees and 
appointees of the governor who 
serve 12-year terms. 

Denham's bill calls for 
the Legislature to amend the 
Constitution to "eliminate the 
independence of the University of 
California." However, California 
voters would need to approve 
any changes made to the state 
Constitution. 

'" appreciate the reason the UC 
system currently has an autono-
mous situation unlike other 
state agencies; Denham stated . 
"However, when abuses such as 
those that have come to light the 
last few months appear to be sys-
temic rather than isolated, then we 
must act to protect the taxpayers." 

Denham also warned the regents 
that if the pay practices were not 
made more clear, he would take 
action. 

"UC leaders would be well 
advised to move quickly and deci-
sively on their own to make solid, 
real changes, and stop the UC 
secret pay hike scandal." he stat-
ed. "The UC leaders cannot keep 

claiming they must raise student 
fees while at the same time taking 
these huge pay hikes." 

Recent reports published by 
the Chronicle have revealed that 
almost 2,300 high-ranking univer-
sity employees made more than 
$200,000 last year and nearly 500 
employees earned annual salaries 
exceeding $300,000. These figures 
represent a 50-percent increase 
since last year in the number of 
university faculty and staff earning 
more than $300,000 annually. 

At the same time, students have 

w advised to move 
quickly and decisively 

on their own to 
make solid, real 

changes and stop the 
UC secret pay 
hike scandal" 

- Jeff Denham, State Senator, 
R-tv\erced 

faced a 79-percent increase in 
mandatory student fees in the last 
four years. 

UC spokesman Paul Schwartz 
said in tbe Chronicle that since the 
articles were published, the 10-

. campus system has been working 
to improve its compensation prac-
tices and that the university is still 
waiting for the results of legislative 
h~arings and an audit into its com-
pensation practices before it alters 
those policies. 

· We welcome the opportuni-

ty to discuss with Sen. Durham 
his concerns." Schwartz said. "But 
we would hope that the timing of 
any additional actions taken by 
members of the Legislature could 
come after the completion of these 
numerous efforts." 

UC President Robert C. Dynes 
called for the creation of a task 
force last December to explore the 
university's compensation poli -
cies and make pay practices more 
transparent. The members, headed 
by Board of Regents Chairman 
Gerald L. Parsley, will present a 
preliminary report at a Jan. 18 
meeting at UCSD. ArJeast two UC 
regents have publicly agreed to the 
Chronicle that, in the future, the 
university needs to be more open 
about its compensation. 

"I don't think there is any dis-
agreement by the regents that [sal-
ary information) should be dis -
closed; Regent Judith Hopkinson 
said. 

Regent John Moores also said 
he favored a more transparent pay 
system. 

"I strongly favor transparency 
to both the public and the regents 
on a wide range ofissues, including 
compensation," Moores said. 

However, some faculty mem -
bers want to see an independent 
investigation rather than have leg-
islators intervene. 

"' am definitely an opponent 
of the legislators' trying to get 
involved in running the universi-
ty," said UCLA sociology professor 
Maurice Zeitlin to the Chronicle, 
who helped organize a petition 
calling for the university to start 
an independent investigation . "I 
don't like the precedent even if it 
involves something ( agree with:'

005: BRAVE NEW CINEMA 
Corrupt politicians, couch-jumping celebri -ties, CIA leak investigations, gay cowboys and the virtual destruction of the Gulf Coast made 200S a very memorable year. It was 
a year where many things came to an end: George 
Lucas' special effect-laden opus "Star Wars Episode 
III: Revenge of the Sith" put a cap on the franchise; 
Tom Cruise's respectability and sanity dissipated in 
his attempt. 10 promote "War of the Worlds"; and, 
after months of speculation, Nick and Jessica tragi -
cally separated. But the political scandal on Capitol 
Hill were much more shocking than anything in Us 
Weekly. 

Turmoil in Washington fueled an intriguing year 
in Hollywood, and many boldly political fUms were 
released in 2005. Not since Watergate and Vietnam 
rocked the nation in the '70s has Hollywood had the 
fuel for so many controversial films about hot-but-
ton issues. Mainstream celebrities (including George 
Clooney) had no problem putting their careers on the 
line to make overtly political dramas like "Syriana;' 
"Goodnight and Good Luck;' and "The Constant 
Gardner" - ftlms that directly or indirectly took a 
stab at the Bush administration's ties to big oil, big 
media and big pharmaceutical companies. In addi-
tion, historical dramas like "Jarhead" and "Munich" 
took a war-questioning perspective at a time when 
the United States has involvement in several Middle 
Eastern conflicts. 

and camp of Wisteria Lane for her role as a transgen-
der father in "Transamerica:' 

However, Huffman was one of only a few wom~n 
who made 2005 memorable. It was a year of many 
things, but it was definitely a year of men. Films like 
"Jarhead;' "A Hi tory of Violence" and "Wedding 
Crashers" teemed with testosterone - but they also 
happened to be some of the best movies of the year. 
Chick-flicks were virtual audience-repellent. "In Her 
Shoes" and "Must Love Dogs" did nothing to breathe 
new life into the genre. While female-directed mov-
ies like "North Country" and the sweetly charming 
"Me and You and Everyone We Know" garnered 
some critical acclaim, they failed to appeal to mass 
audiences. 

Politics and masculinity may have been the order 
of the day at the local multiplex, but here are my top 
five personal favorites in 2005: 

1 Munich 

But it wasn't just politics as usual in this year's 
mOviemaking. While the debate over gay marriage 
could be heard in the haJJs of Congress, movie 
stars took risks p laying homosexual characters. Mo t 
notably, Jake GyUenhaal and Heath Ledge r saddled 
up as two gay cowpokes in Ang Lee's "Brokeback 
Mountain:' Blit they were not alone. Cillian Murphey 
fluttered his baby-blue eyes as a cross-dressing caba -
ret singer in "Breakfast on Pluto." in "Capote," Philip 
Seymour Hoffman gave a chilling performance as the 
famed author, who was one of the first openly gay 
celebrities; and Felicity Huffman ditched the glam 

We don't live in a black and white world, and that 
is never more apparent than in Steven Spielberg's 
"Munich; ' his best film since " chindler's List:' The 
movie chronicles a Mossad squad assigned to as as-
sin ate the terrorists that murdered 11 Israeli athletes 
during the 1972 Olympics. In the beginning, the 
team tackled its mission with a lust for blood, but 
as the body count rises, the assignment haunts each 
member's moral conscience. This plot-driven film is 
a transition for Spielberg. The legendary director cap-
tured the coolness of an espionage th filler set in the 
'70s with a cast that is a who's who of international tal -
ent, including Eric Bana as the moralist team leader 
and Daniel Craig as a trigger-happy South African 
agent. But the film also has a potent political message 
about the endless cycle of violence that plagues the 
Israeli- Palestinian conflict and the current war on

in 2005, but here are my 
10 favorites, 
By Cody B. Nabours 
HIATUS EDITOR

Far and away m y 
favorite re lease of the 
year, Broken Social 
Scene is a sprawl ing, 
impassioned mess of 
an album. The beautiful chaos truly sounds like 
the collective mind s of the 17 -person supergroup, 
with each member's own style and talents com-
bining with the others to form omething called 

all -too-familiar dream experienced for the very 
first time. It is at once an album -long mood piece, 
a collection of bedazzling songs, and a series of 
moments too sublime to describe. The majestic 
disorder is epic, grander than any individual 
could singularly conceive. It's nearly too much for 
anyone person to handle. 

Boss Ditties: "Ibi Dreams of Pavement (A Better 
Day)" and "Swimmers"

. Start 200& the Right ,Way - With the Best 
Darned Rock 'n' Roll Music of Last Year 

" TOP TEN, from page 8 
guitars, feel -good pianos, dueling recorders and 
old-school scratching and sampling are irresist-
ible, providing mini-soundtracks to made-up '70s 
car chases and storybook moments of fuzzy-
wuzzy romance. There's one thing that's for sure: 
Listening to the Go! Team feels fucking great. 

Boss Ditties: "Huddle Formation" and 
"Everyone's a V.I.P. to Someone" 

3 Sufjan Stevens Come On 
Feel The lllinoise' 

It's a story about America, 
the supposed "real 
America" with flat farm -
land, endless suburbia and, of course, the Windy 
City. Playing just about every instrument on the 
album, Sufjan tevens manages to capture the 
romance of the 20th-century Midwe t with roil-
ing guitar and piano arrangements, flute, horns, 
xylophone and just about anything else that 
can play music, including Sufjan's own whispery 
voice. Heartfelt and preciously pieced together 
songs about American life (and, of cour e IUinois) 
are the game here. Even Superman and serial 
kiUer John Wayne Gacy are allowed their own 
songs, but better than the songs' subjects are their 
elegant, purring arrangements. 

Bos Ditties: " asimir Pula ki Day" and 
"Chicago" 

4 Amadou and Mariam Diamanche 
Ii Bamako 

When world music star 
Manu Chao decided 
to produce an album 
for one of Mali's top acts, the blind, married 
Amadou and Mariam, he did a vast service for 
the world , sparing us all fr"m another one of 
his IS-song albums based around the same four 
parts. Instead, armed with the pair's smooth 
voices and winning charm, Amadou's spectacu-
larly accomplished gUitar, Chao's catchy beats 
and of course, his omnipresent, nasally voice, 
the three of them managed to create the perfect 
mix of African-sounding music for Western 
ears. Chao's insistent energy balances perfectly 
with the duo's laid-back liquidity; the result is 
like a street parade in Senegal, but without the 
need for a travel agent or any inoculations. 

Boss Ditties: "Coulibaly" and "Senegal Fast 
Food" 

5 The Boy Least Likely To The Best Party 
Ever 

Few things make me 
happy these days, but 
this irrepressibly cute 

-.......... 

batch of twee-pop is akin to slamming a syringe 
filled with sunshine into my veins. It's easy to 
feel warm and fuzzy-like while listening to the 
whimsical bag of instrwnents played, it seems, 
by the' band of stuffed animals that adorn the 
cove!. Counter to the sugar-sweet melodies 
and toy-chest instrumentation, the lyrics are 
paranQid, neurotic and insecure, but wrapped 
in a security blanket of childhood wonder. It's 
quite liberating to look at life's struggles through 
the eyes of a child, and its one of the happiest 
experiences of 2005. 

Boss Ditties: "I See Spiders When I Close 
My Eyes" and ''I'm Glad I Hitched My Apple 
Wagon To Your Star" 

6 Sharon Jones and The Dap-Kinls 
Naturally 

Nobody who hears this 
can believe it came out 
in 2005; instead they 
imagine the husky-voiced 
Jones was once female competition for a young 
James Brown sometime in the mid-'6Os. Jones 
lays it down, hot and soulful, and her almost 
entirely vanilla backing band is incurably tight 
and groovin: simply impossible not to dance to. 
No good time is complete without some of that 
hot buttered soul - the kind that flows fom the 
heart, smooth and funky. Mrs. Jones will have 

no problems bringing the smooth, soulful spirit, 
and her Dap-Kings will be sure to funk you up. 
Boss Ditties: "Your Thing Is A Drag" and "How 
Do I Let A Good Man Down?" 

7 MH. Arular 
For some reason, the 
question that always 
comes up regarding 
M.I.A:s not-quite ' hip-
hop is, "Why is this shit 
any good?" Her rhymes are simple, repetitive 
and hard to understand, and her beats are harsh, 
bare and hardly produced. But in spite of these 
glaring faults, or perhaps because of tht:m, the 
album is imbued with a sloppy, sexy spirit that 
makes it a tantalizing reward for anyone that 
can get past the first few unfamiliar listens. Her 
electro-beat are hot and dirty, much like her 
British/Sri Lankan -accented dancehall toasts, 
and if it doesn't get bodies to the dance-floor, 
you're at the wrong fucking party. 

Boss Ditties: "Galang" and "Bucky Dun Gun" 

8 Fiery Furnaces EP 
The team of bro-and-
sis weirdsters trimmed 
down their fully insane 
sonic jumble into a set 
of almost-passable poppy 
creations (Note: "pop" for the Fiery Furnaces 
i till pretty damn strange). Don't worry, the 
strange electronic noises are still here, as are the 
theatrical pianos, the disjointedly insane lyrics 
and, of course, the ever-toothy guitars. This 
time, though, they are combined into something 
that isn't a mock opera about the high seas or 
a charmingly stumbling Velvet Underground 
homage, but just something that's eccentric, 
charming and toe-tappingly cute. 

Boss Ditties: "Here Comes the Summer" and 
" meHing Cigarettes" 

Thelonius Monk 9 _.',,", Quartet with •• - ...... John Coltrane 
At Carnegie Hall 

Monk. Trane. Playing 
live jazz. At Carnegie 
Hall. They just found the 
recording last year. What else do you want from 
me? 

Boss Ditties: "Epistrophy" and "Blue Monk" 

10 Brilht Eyes I'm Wide Awake, 
It's Morning 

I think by now, we're quite 
familiar with how melo-
dramatic the shaky-voiced 
Conor Oberst is. Regardless of how clumsy and 
nearly embarrassing his words can be, Bright Eyes 
is completely shameless about it. Though he may 
be 25 years old - not quite the adolescent boy he 
appears to be on record - he sings with the voice 
of American youth, realizing all at once the shitti-
ness of the world around him, his miniscule place 
in it, the lingering beauty of youth that can't ever 
be recaptured, and the importance oflove in such 
a place. He sings as if realizing everything for the 
first time, like the child he pretends to be. Added 
to a background of achingly bittersweet alt -coun-
try, it's a remarkably memorable revelation.

Everything"

Ghostface Killah and Trife Da God 
• Put It On the Line 
STARKS ENTERPRISES 

*** In the rapidly expanding world of hip-hop blogging, rappers like Trife Da God are referred to as "weed 
carriers; implying that they are merely 
part of the entourage, rewarded with 
guest spots as payment for their loyalty 
and subservience. However, Ghostface 
places Trife front and center on Put 11 
On the Line, showing that his man is 
more than just a marijuana vessel. 

Trife is at his strongest when 
accompanied by mentor Ghostface, 
and their chemistry on tracks like 
"Cocaine Trafficking" and "Fire" is 
reminiscent of Ghost's duets with 
Raekwon back in the good old days. 
"Milk 'Em" is the highlight of the 
album, with both Mes rapping at 
breakneck speed over one of the raw-
est, grittiest beats in recent memory. 
Surprisingly, the album doesn't lose 

momentum when Ghost takes off 
Trife's training wheels, as Da God 
holds his own on solo tracks "Hustle ' 
Hard," the reggae-influenced "War." 
and "Drogz," a storytelling track that 
could seamlessly blend in with any 
Wu-Tang release. 

The album struggles through 
some unoriginal, cliched songs like 
"Gangsta Shit" and "Game Time; and 
more verses by Ghostface throughout 
the album couldn't have hurt, but 
overall, Trife successfully removes 
himself from Ghost's large shadow. 
While it is dear by Trife's unrefined 
style that Ghostface is still holding 
his hand, in due time, Trife is sure 
to have his very own "weed carriers" 
begging for spots on his album.

The Strokes 
• First Impressions of Earth 
RCA 

***~ Sometime not too long ago, the Fab Five were like mythical beings, enjoying Heineken and Camels in 
the bars of NYC. adored by their fans 
and leading a modern wave of rock 'n 
roll artists into the new millennium. 
But the next year's class pushed the 
Strokes out of their spotlight, and less 
than five years later the boys are nearly 
a nostalgia act in the eyes of hipsters 
and consumers everywhere - WTongly 
convinced that the Strokes are all about 
style. 

On their third album, the instru-
ments sound tighter than ever, 
with guitar, bass and drums flex-
ing newly inflated muscles while still 
locked in the ~onic jigsaw that is the 
Strokes' trademark. This time, Julian 
Casablancas croons for the first time 
with 60ulful candor, channeling a Rat 
Pack Lou Reed, but rising to a whis-

key-inspired howl in sudden bursts of 
manic emotion. His lyrical pleas to a 
spoiled, hardly interested lady friend 
act as a thinly veiled reference to a 
public that has moved on to the next 
big thing. leaving the poor boys stuck 
in "Remember the 'OOs?" episodes. 

However, Casablancas seems 
assured of his fate, admitting. 'We 
could drag it out, but that's for other 
bands to dol I've got nothing to say.' 
The combination of his slack nihilism 
and the band's taut electricity make for 
an addictive listen, but Casablancas 
doesn't quite live up to his word, drag-
ging the album out with at least four 
unnecessarily bad tracks (a Strokes 
first), indicating that perhaps his less-
than-interested lady friend was right 
all along.

Some Risky Politics Weasel 
Their Way onto the Silver Screen 
• FILM, from page 6 murder case in Kansas. Part biopic and 
terror. Although the film may be too part character study, the flim exam-
controversial to earn Oscar gold, the ined the touching and dysfunctional 
director should be commended for relationship between Capote and one 
making such a bold statement. of the murderers, Perry Smith, sympa-

thetically portrayed by Clifton Collins 
Jr. This film's rich storytelling. great 2 A History of Violence performances and potent depictions 
of the real-life author and the violent 
criminals made "Capote" one of the 
best biopics in years. 

David Cronen berg's psychologi-
cal profile of a family man (Viggo 
Mortenson) with a past mysteriously 
connected to the mob was riddled 
with intrigue and suspense. T he film 
had the allure of a good crime saga and 
Cronenberg's twisted sense of storytell-
ing. Plus, Mortenson's disturbing and 
arousing portrayal of a loving husband 
and father with an innate ability to kill 
was one of the best performances of 
the year. 

3 Jarhead 
In an age where World War II sto-

ries are recycled and retold, director 
Sam Mendes gave us a contemporary 
look at war. The film adaptation of a 
Gulf War veteran's memoir illustrated 
the pain and frustration that the sol-
diers went through, even though they 
saw little combat. Mendes also gave 
us a glimpse of how the effects of war 
torment soldiers throughout their life. 
The flim was a tribute to the Marines 
who served in Desert Storm and those 
who are fighting in the current con-
flict. Jake Gyllenhaal also looked pretty 
good prancing around in nothing but a 
strategically placed Santa hat.

tion novel that chronicled a notorious 

5 Brokeback Mountain 
In a year where controversial ftIms 

are flooding the theaters, "Brokeback 
Mountain" is perhaps the most revolu-
tionary. The story of two closeted cow-
boys who have a 20-year-long secret 
affair shattered all gay stereotypes. The 
boys of "Brokeback" do not spend the 
entire film lassoing each other in leath.-
e r chaps or redecorating the ranch. Ln 
reality, there has been no other flim 
that shows the struggles of homo exu-
a1ity with such dignity and respect. It 
is a straightforward and heartbreaking 
story, but Ledger's performance steals 
the show. His portrayal of a repressed 
man ashamed of his own seXUality is 
as subtle as it is moving. 

It was a good year in flim, although 
there was no great character-driven 
film like last year's emotional power 
punch "Million Dollar Baby" or the 
refreshingly real "Sideways:' However, 
2005 saw the revival of hilarious sex 
comedies like "Wedding Crashers" and 
"The 40-Year-Old V'trgin:' And Peter 
Jackson proved in "King Kong" that a 
three-hour-Iong film about a big ape 
can actually be entertaining. But, more 
importantly, it was a year when many 
relevant films were made, some that 
will have an impact on audiences for 
decades to come. And I hope the trend 
continues in 2006.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATUS 11 

And the Award for Hyped-Up Hip-Hop Goes to I .. 2005! 
By Adam Staley 

SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

Some of us might not believe it, and won't want to accept it, but as painful as it might be, 2005 
was a pretty shitty year for hip-hop 
albums. That is not to say that there 
were no quality albums (there were), 
but the past year was characterized 
by records that simply didn't live 
up to the hype. And with that , here 
are the Guardian's 2005 Hip-Hop 
Awards: 

Most Overrated A1bllm 
This distinction goes to Common, 

whose album Be received high scores 
across the board and was viewed as 
a breath of fresh air in the hip-hop 
world. Unfortunately, Be wasn't the 
21st century J/lmatic it so badly want-
ed to be, instead becoming a solid 
album too self-absorbed to appeal to 
anyone but die-hard Common fans 
and devotees of the G-Unit-obsessed 
XXL magazine. Kanye West's Late 
Registration could easily qualify in 
this category as well, not for his 
album's shortcomings, but rather 
because Kanye could crap in a jewel 
case, sell it for $18, and critics would 
still sing his praises. Late Registration 
was pretty damn good, and West is 
obviously one of the top producers 
in hip-hop, but his abilities as an 
MC remain suspect, and much of his 
material is a genre-defying sort of 
soulful-indie-hipster-pop that relies 
far too heavily on sampling. 

A1bllm that Actually Lived Up to 
the Hype 

Much like Be, Little Brother's 
Minstrel Show created a buzz in the 
industry months before its release, 
with rumors of "five-m ic" and 
"XXL" ratings abounding. Unlike 
Be, Little Brother delivered an out-
standing and fun album from begin-
ning to end, showing that not aU 

conscious rappers take themselves 
too seriously. Dangerdoom's The 
Mouse and the Mask deserves an 
honorable mention as MF Doom 
and Danger Mouse's superb collabo-
ration received more scrutiny as a 
cross-promotion with Adult Swim, 
yet was able to maintain its own fla-
vor and character, living up to both 
artists' lofty expectations. 

Worst Commercially 
Successful Album 

This one's easy, so we' ll keep it 
short. Enough of "Candy Shop" and 
"A Lil Bit" - 50 Cent's Massacre 
was a complete disaster of an album. 
Although Mariah Carey was the only 
one to top Fiddy in sales, his constant 
self-promotion, seJling out and sacri-
ficing dignity for money has dimin-
ished his reputation among rappers, 
with countless mixtape disses and 
lack of respect the result. Mike Jones' 
Who Is Mike Jones? comes in at a close 
second, because it's rarely good if the 
chopped-n-screwed version is more 
listenable than the original. 

Best Commercially 
Successful Album 

MTV plays an awful lot of gar-
bage, but thankfully, Young jeezy and 
his solo debut Thug Motivation 101 
were thrown in with the lot. In the 
ultra self-conscious world of hip-hop, 
jeezy seems exceedingly comfortable 
in his own skin, and this cool confi-
dence keeps you smiling throughout 
his album. Honorable mentions go 
to the Game's DOCllm~ntary for its 
production and to Paul Wall's 71le 
People's Champ. 

Surprisingly Good A1bllDl 
that I Didn't Want to Like 

Having never been a fan of Slug. 
I didn't even want to give Felt 2, 
his second collaboration with Murs, 
a chance. However, Felt 2 provided 
some of the best, funkiest production 

of the year with some of Sluis least 
depressing lyrics, making the sequel 
much better than the original. An 
honorable mention goes to Edan's 
Beauty and the Beat, a well -conceived 
early-'9Os throwback set that many 
consider the album of the year. 

Comeback of the Year 
This one goes to all of the people 

of Boot Camp Clik/Duck Down 
Records. These pillars of mid -'90s 
New York hip-hop had fallen off the 
radar until Sean Price, Buckshot and 
Smif-N-Wessun all released albums' 
thi year. While we are still waiting 
for another Heltah, Skeltah project, 
we're just happy to have these leg-
ends back in the game. 

Album of the Year 
Here is what you have been wait -

ing for, presented clearly in list for-
mat, in de cending order, the top 10 
albums of the year: 

10) Sean Price: Monkey Harz 
9) Corm ega: The Testament 
8) DJ Muggs vs. GZA: 

Grandmasters 
7) Geto Boys: The Foundation 
6) Mistah F.A.B.: Son oj a Pimp 
5) Bun-B: Trill 
4) Dangerdoom: The Mouse and 

the Mask 
3) Cage: Hells Winter 
2) Little Brother: The Minstrel 

Show 
1) Messy Marv: Bandannas, Tattoos 

6- Tongue Rings 

Call it a Bay Area bias if you 
like, but San Francisco's Messy Marv 
released an excellent album, complete 
with a tribute to Mac Ore, an anti-
cunnilingus anthem, a G-Unit diss, 
an insightful collaboration with Dead 
Prez, a dedication to his mother, 
hilarious skits and quality production 
the whole way through. What more 
could one ask for?

Watson Rejected Beer Garden Propos.al Future Fee Stability Far 
From Certain, LAO says ~ ALCOHOL, from page 1 

as Sub tance! Alcohol Feedback and 
Education, which won AAlls College 
and University Drinking and Driving 
Prevention Award in 2005. 

The program was recognized 
nationally for taking innovative steps 
to avoid drunk driving and treat alco-
holism among college students. 

Sale of alcohol at events like 
TGs will be difficult to implement, 
Samaniego-Kraus said. 

"Most of UCSD undergraduates 
are under 2 1, which will make it 
difficult for student organizations 
to ensure that underage drinking 
doesn't happen, as it is a university 
and state poUcy:' Samaniego-Kraus 
said. 

Although Watson supports having 
a beer garden at TGs, he still stands 
by past statements that alcohol is not 
the central catalyst to increase student 
interaction and enjoyment. 

Late last year, Watson rejected 
a Sun God beer garden proposal 
because it would be hard for security 
to control. 

"Sun God is a different matter 
than TGs because there are a lot more 
people to look after:' Watson said. 

However, Watson had suggested 
to the A.S. Council that if safety 
precautions were taken for the beer 
garden, he would have approved the 
Sun God event, according to former 
A.S. President Jenn Pae. 

"We were under the impression 
that if we applied ourselves toward 
safety concerns, we would be able 
to have a beer garden:' Pae said last 
year. "To have the idea be rejected 
was very sad:' 

Although Corell agrees that strict 
measures should be implemented for 
any event serving alcohol, she insists 
that having a beer garden at Sun God 
should not be any different than hav-
ing one at TGs. 

"There's a lot of alcohol aware-
ness groups on campus for students 

and we should give students more 
freedom to use their best judgment 
while drinking:' she said. "I think 
we're old enough to make our own 
decisions. As young adults, we need 
to be given room to ... make mis-
takes." 

But Watson baid there's been 
confusion about where he stands on 
alcohol-related events, saying that he 
doesn't object to them as long as they 
abide by campus rules. 

"Controlling alcohol abuse at

enough to make our 

own decisions?' 
- Rachel Corell, Senior Senator, 

Revelle College Council 

TGs isn't full -proof because there 
will always be people who break 
rules:' Watson said. "But we can 
better facilitate and prevent a cohol 
problems by limiting the amount of 
alcohol being served, having non-
alcoholic beverages and providing 
food to underage students:' 

Implementing such restrictions 
has worked successfully at past events 
and would successfuUy control drink-
ing at TGs, according to Watson. 

"There was a Jack Johnson con-
cert that had a beer garden last year 
and there weren't any arrests or prob-
lems," UCSD Police Lt. David Rose 
said. 

Samaniego-Kraus, though. wor-
ries that alcohol could always ignite 
abuse and has negative consequenc-
es, even in the presence of tight 
security. 

However, Corell said UCSD does 
a good job of alcohol control, citing 
the fact that she knows many under-

age students who have been rejected 
from purchasing alcohol at campus 
events. 

TGs should come back to cater 
to students who don't live on cam-
pus and are seeking a social event, 
she said. The event can also aid 
in diversifying UCSD's image for 
alumni. 

"Commuters and transferstudents 
are a very important part of UCSD 
and we must look for ways to have 
them want to stay around on campus 
after class is over:' Corell said. 

Alcohol wouldn't be the focus of 
any of the events, she said. 

Rose attended UCSD during the 
early 1980s, when TGs were popular 
and remembers them positively as a 
place for students, staff and faculty 
members to get together. However, 
there was little security and control 
to · prevent underage drinking, he 
said. 

The TGs were held at the grassy, 
hilly area between Student Center 
and Main Gym. 

Although alcohol offenses have 
risen since he started working for the 
campus, Rose said statistical infor-
mation can be deceiving, as it may 
be due to the growing number of 
police officers and higher rates of 
enforcement. 

Although researchers from UC 
Berkeley have found that most cases 
of student drinking were related to 
off-campus parties. negotiations to 
revive the TG events are still under-
way, with logistics including fmances 
and security still far from being fmal-
ized. 

"As an alumnus, I don't want 
UCSD to have the reputation of being 
a hard school with no social life, but 
we don't want to create an environ-
ment where alcohol abuse exists:' 
Rose said.

Imagine the fans across the NFL 
landscape rejoicing early in the sea-

dynasty appeared to be finally over. 
The team lost to the Panthers early 
on, and then was demolished by Ihe 
Chargers and Colts and an abundance 
of injuries that decimated the defense. 
The only thing holding the team 
together was quarterback Tom Brady 
and his Joe Cool style of football . 

Unfortull'ateIy, the Patriots are 
now back, and in a dominating late-
season shutout of the Bucs and a 
28-3 beat down of the Jaguars last 

. week, they showed they might be 
better than ever. They play smart-
er football than any team in the 
league, and the return of linebacker 
Tedy Bruschi has been more than 
just a heart-warming comeback. 

In the end, Denver might have

have three of the last four Super

DAILY BRUIN 

(CSTV U-WIRE) LOS 
ANGELES - The air was buzz-
ing in Pauley Pavilion. Ryan Wright 
hit a jumper putting UCLA up 18-

pumped up, the alumni were excit-
ed, and the student section ... went

This year the Bruins opened 
Pac-IO play" during winter break, 
with many students out of town 
and therefore unable to attend the 
game. 

The day after fmals ended, the 
Bruins won a big game on the road 
in Ann Arbor and everyone was 
excited for them to come home to 
Westwood, Calif. 

The problem is that before they 
came home, all of the students had 
already gone home for the holi-
days. UCLA returned to an empty 
house and played a total of four 
home games over the break. The 
team notched wins against Wagner, 
Sacramento State and Stanford, but 
ended up losing to Cal. 

Someone forgot to get out their 
date book before planning the holi-
days this year. 

Many students were uncontrol-
lably double-booked. The overlap of 
break and big games makes a huge 
problem for out-of-town students 
who shelled out the money at the 
beginning of the yea.r for sports 
packages and have to miss those 
games.

Game Streak 

Foiled By

were a little tired," Scates said. 

"We weren't passing as good as 
we had, and everything was worse 
than on Friday. It was a definite 
regreSSion. I expected the team to 
play better." 

Losing to Long Beach State could 
have big implications later this sea-
son, as the 4gers were ranked No. 
3 by the MPSF coaches and are 
expected to be one oUhe top teams 
in the country this season. 

Despite the loss, George 
emerged as a team leader, smashing 
a career-high 18 kills and earriing 
A11-Tournament honors. 

Senior Nick Scheftic was also 
named to the All-Tournament 
team. 

The team is confident that it 
will improve as the season con-
tinues and the players gain more 
experience playing against tough 
competitors. 

"We have not had very good 
competition lately, and it was get-
ti ng too easy for t he first team to 
dominate the second team in our 
drills," Scates said. 

'We're definitely going to bounce 
back when we start league play this 
week. Maybe it was a good loss 
because we're going to come charg-
ing back."

49ERS STAY ON ., 
TOP WITH WIN 

OVER UCLA 
Tritons face similar 
defeat to hands of 
4gers days later, 

By MiclJacl Wozny 
DAILY BRUIN 

(C TVU-WIRE)LO A GELES 
- In the fir t weekend of regular 
sea on play, the UCLA men's vol-
leyball team seemed to lack the 
energy needed a day after weeping 
Its fir t two ,matche . 

On Friday, the Bruin played 
with energy and motivation, defeat -
1I1g both Stanford and UCSB in 
straight games. 

But on Saturday night, UCLA 
appeared fatigued. falli ng to Cal 

tate Long Beach 30-25, 34-36, 
25-30. 22 -30 in the champion hip 
mat h of the UC B/Elephant Bar 
Collegiate Invitational. 

"It wa hard to play three match-
es in two day :' UCLA coach AI 
. cates said. "\ e did not look good 
at all, and everyone played like they 
were tired." 

"There wa n't really anything 
we did well as a team again t Long 
Beach:' cates added. 

After the grad uation of five of 
the even tarter from last year's 

AA finals team, it could have 
been thought that this season would 
be one of rebuilding. 

The Bruins (2 - 1) took a dif-
fe rent approach, compili ng a 7-1 
preseason record and earning a No. 
2 preseason league ranking in the 
Mountain Pacific ports Federation 
(M PSF) coache ' poll. 

UCLA played up to its ran ~­
ing on Friday aftern oon, beating 

tanford 30- 14, 30-24. 30-22 in its 
eason opener. 

Agains t the tan ford Cardinal. 
U LA hit ,460, led by senior 
Damien .:ott and junior Paul 
George. who had nine and eight 
kills, respectively. 

The freshmen also came up big 
for the Bruins, with outside hit-
te r Sean O'Malley adding 10 kills 
and seven total blocks and Jamie 
Diefenbach recording eight kill~ 
and five blocks. 

T he Bruins continued their 
st rong play on Friday night, sweep-
ing host UCSB 30-23. 30-27. 30-
28. 

George led the Bruins with 
14 kill s in 20 swings (.700) and 
O'Malley slammed 10 kill as the 
Bruins hit at a ,421 clip against the 
Gauchos. 

"We played great (o n Friday) ;' 
Scates said . "We really hit the ball 
well . set well, and passed well. Paul 
played the best he's ever played, and 
Sean had two good matches:' 

After two dominant wins on 
Friday. th e defending UCSBI 
Elephant Bar Invitational Champion 
Bruins were unable to sustain the 
energy they played with the night 
before. 

Although UCLA raced to a 26-
12 lead in Game I again st the 4gers, 
the Bruins let Lo ng Beach tate pull 
to 27-21 before ealing the game 
30-25. 

UCLA could have grabbed a 2-0 
game lead, but let the second game 
; lip away after leading 34-33. 

The Bruins didn't seem to have 
much in them after the Game 2 
loss, quickl y losing the next two 
games to the 4gers. 

In contrast to Friday's solid hit-
ting, the Bruins hit only .103 as a 
team on aturday. 

"Neither team played particu -
larly well , and I think both teams

Top Seeds to Advance 
After Week-long Rest 

Panthers, Patriots 
will advance with 
Colts and Seahawks 
to NFC and AFC 
championships. 

We are inching closer to the Super Bowl and before we finally arive, I 
would like to publish my NFL play-
off predictions so that next Monday 
I can come to school and prove to 
everyone that I have Nostradamu -
like skills. So, without further ado, 
here are my playoff predictions: 

NFC 
Redskins at Seahawks 

After watching the Washington 

and the Redskins are not. Though 
Washington won earlier in the 
eason. Seattle is better prepared 

now. The Seattle defense and offen-
ive line will do the real work, 

Alexander will get a couple cheap 
touchdowns and all the glory, and 
the Sea hawks will win the game. 

Joe's Pick: Seattle Seahawks 
Panthers at Bears 

The Bears have the number-one 
. defense in the league (statistically, 

Tampa Bay can claim superiority, 
but again. having locked up position 
early allowed the Bears to re t many 
players and hand the Vikings a 34-
10 win). This a team with no overt 
individual egos, simply because their 
star running back was suppo ed to 
be a backup. their starting quar-

jtevelowOucsd.edu lets his game 

ers against 
a Seahawks team that houses the 
league's new single-sea on touch-
down leader, running back and 
league MVP Shaun Alexander. 
However, jumping to a conclu -
ion that eattle has this game in 

the bag overlooks several factors . 
First. Seattle played in the Frs 

weakest conference. Racking up six 
wins against th.e Rams, Cardinals 
and iners does not qualify a 
team as a Super Bowl contender. 
I n fact. only two of Seattle's 13 
wins came against playoff teams: 
one over the Colts when they were 
resting before the playoffs and one 
over the Giants because Jay Feely 
missed three game .. winning field 
goal . Last week, Washington shut 
down Cadillac Williams. a running 
back who. unlike Alexander, con-
tributes in all areas of the game. 
This week's defensive coordinator 
will tweak the scheme but main-
tain the pressure, as Washington 
will have no trouble tackling 
Alexander and his enlarged head. 

Unfortunately for Washington, 
the Seahawks are one of the most 
well-rounded teams in the league. 

speak for itself. 
On the other hand, the Carolina 

defense might have been a little over-
rated this year. ure, defensive ends 
Julius Peppers and Mike Rucker are a 
great duo and cornerback Ken Lucas 
has been steady, but defen ive tackle 
Brentson Buckner" best attribute is 
his personality, and the 10 s of fel -
low DT Kris Jenkins for the econd 
straight year has hurt. Even though 
the Panthers are till playing, it's not 
for lack of failure. They have only 
won two games over fellow playoff 
teams and already lost once to these 
Bears, mustering only three points. 
And yet, I ~till fll1d myself ignor-
ing the old "defense wins cham-
pionships" adage. Carolina wide 
receiver Steve Smith was completely 
humbled after last week' win, run-
ning back DeShaun Foster still has 
fresh legs after watching Stephen 
Davis carry the early season load 
and with Jake Delhomme's steady 
leader hip and southern charm, 
the Carolina offense can make 
enough of a dent into the Chicago 
defense that will leave Bears QB Rex 
Grossman struggling to keep up. 
As long as this Carolina team can 
avoid turnovers and missed field 
goals that result in touchdowns for 
the opponent, they should be OK. 

Joe's Pick: Carolina Panthers 
AFC 

Steelers at Colts 
For much of the season, the big-

gest sports story was whether or not 
the Colts could go undefeated. That 
was the second -biggest sports story, 
but only because Terrell Owens is 
like crack to the news media out-
lets. Of course, the Colts piped ream 
came to an end at the hands of 
San Diego's own SuperChargers! 

The teelers beat Cincinnati last 
week in tough, hard-no ed foot-
ball with a sprinkle of running 
back Willie Parker's speed, a dash 
of Antwaan Randle El's versatil -
ity and a chunk of Troy Polamalu's 
hair. They have a young quarter-
back in Ben Roethlisberger, but 
one who has played in the big 
games before and is not fazed . 
Plus, their top wide receiver. Hines 
Ward, is one hell of a receiver. 

The strength of the Steelers 
has been defense since before Bill 
Cowher was sporting that porn-
star moustache on the sideline. This 
year the Colts have defense too. 
Picking up defensive tackle Corey 
Simon solidified their line with 
ends Dwight Freeney and Robert 
Mathis. And Bob Sanders has been 
a leader iJt an extremely improved
