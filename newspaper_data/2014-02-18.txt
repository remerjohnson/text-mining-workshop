Members of the American 
Federation of State, County and 
Municipal Employees 3299 union 
and UC Patient Care Technical 
workers have once again authorized 
a UC-wide strike against allegedly 
unfair wage contracts on Feb. 14. 
The authorization follows a three-
day strike vote Feb. 11 through Feb. 
13 by union bargaining members. 

The announcement — garner-
ing 96 percent in support from the 
service workers units — marks the 
third AFSCME union strike to occur 
in the last 12 months. 

Workers previously protested 
in September and May at the UC 
Office of the President in Oakland 
after nearly unanimous votes, cit-
ing unfair practices in safe staff-
ing standards and demanding wage 
increases due to an expired contract 
yet to be renewed by the UC system.

The 8,300 Services Workers 
and 13,000 Patient Care Technical 
Workers under the AFSCME 3299 
banner make up the lowest paid 
workers — including nurses, sanita-
tion workers and EMT specialists 
— in the UC system and have been 
negotiating higher wage settlements 
with the UC system for over a year.

“Our members seek a fair settle-
ment, and this vote makes it clear 
that UC’s final offer fails to meet 
that standard,” UC Service work-
er and AFSCME 3299 Bargaining 
Team Member Jose Mendez said 
in a union release on Feb. 14. “The 
ball is now in UC’s court. We hope 
they will change course and finally 
choose to work towards an agree-
ment that addresses our core issues 
and honors our contributions to the 
university. If not, our members are 
prepared to strike.”

According to the AFSCME web-
site and union spokesperson Todd 
Stenhouse, members have also dem-
onstrated concern at unfairness 
between negotiations and offers pro-
vided to other UC unions employ-
ees.

“The question is going to be, at 
what point are they going to come 
to the table with fair offers for our 
priorities?” Stenhouse said.

Many state and union leaders 
also expressed support for a contract 
resolution between the UC system 
and AFSCME 3299 workers, includ-
ing California Lieutenant Governor 
and UC Regent Gavin Newsom.

“After years of giving huge sala-
ries to executives, it is time for the 
[University of California] to show 
its lowest paid workers that they 
are a valued part of the UC family,” 
Newsom said in a recent tweet.

Winning Ways
The UCSD softball team 

won its second conference 
series of the season 3–1 
against Chico State last 
weekend Friday, Feb. 14 
and Saturday, Feb. 15.

The city of San Diego is set to pay $250,000 to settle a lawsuit with the first woman to publicly accuse former mayor Bob Filner of 
sexual harassment. 

Irene McCormack-Jackson served as Filner’s 
communications director from January to June 
2013 before publicizing his inappropriate behav-
ior, which included asking her to go to work with-
out panties, demanding kisses and dragging her in 
a headlock. She has been represented by attorney 
Gloria Allred. 

Filner resigned in August of last year after 17 
more women came out to accuse him of harass-
ment and pled guilty to one felony count of false 
imprisonment and two misdemeanor counts of 
battery. 

He will serve three months of home confine-
ment starting Jan. 1; however, he is not responsible 
for any of the money owed to McCormack. After 
the allegations became public, the San Diego 
City Council agreed to pay Filner’s legal fees in 
exchange for his resignation. 

The city’s attorney, Jan Goldsmith negotiated 
the lawsuit, which holds the city responsible as 
Filner’s employer.

“Nothing will come out of [Filner’s] pocket. 
This is the city’s responsibility under the settle-
ment,” Goldsmith told NBC San Diego. “Both sides 
won because we resolved it early,, before a year of 
very expensive litigation plus a trial at the end.”

Three federal judges recently gave 
Governor Jerry Brown a two-year 
extension to resolve California’s over-
crowding prison crisis — an order 
originally mandated by the federal 
court in June 2013 to resolve by 2014.

The extension is one of sever-
al Gov. Brown has received by the 
federal court  to reduce California’s 
prison populations.

He requested a three-year exten-
sion in Sept. 2013, which was reject-
ed, but was granted a four-week 
extension to reduce prison popula-
tions by 8 percent. In Dec. 2013, the 
prison-reduction order was extended 
once again to April 18.

Under the mandates of the recent 
extension, he has until February 2016 

to meet the requirements set for 
California to lower its prison popula-
tion by 1000 inmates. 

“It is encouraging that the Three-
Judge Court has agreed to a two-year 
extension,” Brown said in a statement 
on Feb. 10. “The state now has the 
time and resources necessary to help 
inmates become productive members 
of society and make our communi-
ties safer.”

The judges demand to see prison 
populations reduced to 1,000 by the 
end of June 2014, with eligibility for 
parole given to elderly prisoners and 
those who have serious mental health 
issues first. 

A lawsuit was also filed against 
California by 33,000 prisoners, accus-
ing the state of providing inadequate 
treatments for prisoners with mental 

illnesses.
Director of the nonprofit, Prison 

Law Office, Don Specter, who repre-
sents the prisoners in the lawsuit, is 
discontented with the failure of the 
state to cap prison populations by 
May 2014.

“We’re very disappointed,” Specter 
said in a Feb. 10 ABC news article. 
“We believe that there are substantial 
constitutional violations continuing 
right now which result in prisoners 
suffering and dying because of prison 
overcrowding.” 

Currently, over 117,000 inmates 
are crowded into facilities built to 
originally maintain 81,600 residents. 
An additional 12,200 prisoners are 
incarcerated in private facilities in 

San Diego is responsible for a $250,000 settlement to the 
victim of the former mayor’s sexual harassment.

Over 96 percent of the 
union’s members support 
striking for the third time 
in the last twelve months.

@UCSDGuardian

Researchers at UCSD Medical 
School reported that the approximately 
400,000 of adults living in California 
who smoke cigarettes do not consider 
themselves “smokers.” The number, 
which represents 12.3 percent of active 
smokers in the state, was published 
alongside other research findings in 
Tobacco Control on Feb. 5.

Of the “non-identifying smokers,” 
22 percent smoked cigarettes daily. 

Increased stigma regarding smok-
ing cigarettes seems to play a factor 
in a person labeling themselves a 
“smoker,” which makes the number 
of people who actually smoke seem 
to decrease.

The research noted that the “non-
identifying smokers” were divided 
into two groups: persons who justi-
fied their smoking on social situ-

ations and drinking, stating they 
could quit at any time, and older 
persons who smoke daily and may be 
dealing with nicotine addictions. The 
second group was further described 
as persons who may be embarrassed 
after trying multiple times to quit or 
have dealt with health repercussions 
from their smoking. 

“We hope that [our research] 
will be instrumental in informing 
individuals who smoke that they 
may be downplaying the signifi-
cance of their smoking behavior,” 
UCSD Department of Family and 
Preventive Medicine graduate stu-
dent Eric Leas said. 

The researchers at UCSD Medical 
School utilized cross-sectional 
analysis from the 2011 California 
Longitudinal Smokers Survey. 
Participants in the CLSS include 
individuals who smoked at least 100 
cigarettes in their life, smoked at least 

once in the 30 days preceding their 
interview or currently smoked for at 
least “some days.” 

The research concluded that an 
increased selection criteria may help 
studies in high stigma areas account 
for non-identifying smokers. 

Both UCSD and SDSU have 
become smoke-free campuses dur-
ing the 2013–14 academic year, along 
with a UC-wide ban and, as a result, 
may experience a higher influx of 
students who smoke cigarettes iden-
tifying as a non-smoker.

“Future sociological and cultural 
studies are needed to understand 
how individuals relate with their 
smoking behavior, how society views 
individuals who smoke and how 
these factors can affect self-identifi-
cation,” Leas said.

California and are shipped out to 
other private prison establishments in 
Arizona, Mississippi and Oklahoma. 

California’s use of out-of-state 
private prisons to reduce its pris-
on population has raised concerns 
regarding the living conditions 
inmates face in these establishments. 

An organization known as the 
Grassroots Leadership released a 
report in June 2013 called, “The 
Dirty Thirty,” detailing the histo-
ry of abuse, lawsuits, scandals and 
employee mistreatments of these 
private prison facilities.

In addition to the extension 
Brown received, he proposed a bud-
get plan that would allocate $500 
million to building new jail facili-
ties. Another $81 million would go 

towards rehabilitation programs to 
reintegrate prisoners into society. 

According to last month’s 
released state budget, 11.6 percent 
of the budget was allocated to state 
higher education, while 9 percent 
was allocated toward state prisons 
and correctional facilities.

Funds toward higher education, 
however, still faced a $120.9 million 
shortfall.

With the increase of allocations 
made to prison reduction, A.S. 
Vice President of External Affairs 
Vanessa Garcia is seeing a resur-
gence in student effort to promote 
I.G.N.I.T.E, which stands for “Invest 
in Graduation, not Incarceration, 
Transform Education” — a UC 
Student Association campaign to 
reinvest money into higher edu-
cation by combating prison over-

crowding. 
“Something that I think students 

really need to do in order to com-
bat this investment in prisons over 
higher education is to really show 
our political power and flex that 
political muscle,” Garcia said. “It’s 
hard to beat apathy, but we’re going 
to be run over by this huge political 
machine if we don’t do something. 
We have to mobilize.”

I.G.N.I.T.E. passed a bill last 
year known as AB218, which “bans 
the box,” meaning that people who 
have been released from prison 
do not have to disclose informa-
tion about their conviction until 
after their qualifications as a job 
applicant have been determined. 

The trial is set to begin in 
February 2015.

Former interim mayor Todd 
Gloria, who stepped into the posi-
tion following Filner’s resignation 
and held it up until last week’s elec-
tion, believes the settlement is the 
right step in putting an end to the 
issue.

“I am pleased that a settlement 

has been reached in this case and 
that our city can continue to move 
forward beyond the actions of our 
previous mayor,” Gloria said. “Irene 
McCormack-Jackson deserves the 
gratitude of our city for standing up 
courageously against treatment no 
one should ever endure.”

The settlement releases San Diego 
from future liability to McCormack; 
however, the city still faces two more 
lawsuits, one from another city 

employee and the other from a for-
mer Marine.

San Diego voters elected 
Republican Councilman Kevin 
Faulconer to replace Filner last 
Tuesday by a margin of nine points 
over opponent David Alvarez. 
Faulconer has not commented on 
the settlement.

Pressure 
Doesn’t  
Make 
Diamonds

In the five minutes of the Sochi Winter Olympics that NBC.com allowed me to watch for free, my 
mind was completely boggled. For 
someone like me, who has difficulty 
coordinating texting and walking 
down stairs, the superhuman skill 
and focus on display was epic. But 
unfortunately, not everyone makes 
it on to the medal stand — there are 
skiing tumbles and biathlon misses 
as even the world’s best find the 
pressure difficult to handle. Stress 
doesn’t only cause butterflies — it 
actively sabotages us.

We can all relate to≠ those who 
cave under duress, whether on an 
exceptionally clutch ball toss or on a 
final exam. This is why athletic coach-
es, sportscasters and even parents 
make a point to emphasize the harm 
done by lofty expectations and simi-
lar mental saboteurs. Overthinking 
a situation, such as a penalty shot in 
a soccer game, usually leads to even 
more stress as we try to micromanage 
the task at hand, rather than let our 
bodies do it for us.

A study by University of Chicago 
psychologist Sian Beilock confirmed 
this with a test — elite golfers who 
whistled or hummed tunes right 
before a three-foot putt ended up 
with a much higher shot percentage 
than those who intensely contem-
plated the shot. The whistlers’ brains 
essentially diverted some of the men-
tal resources normally used for wor-
rying, which allowed the putters to 
let their training take over. Similarly, 
when we stop microanalyzing the 
mechanics and small-scale decisions 
behind our actions, we’re much more 
likely to rely on our “second-nature” 
skills — those that hours or years of 
practice reinforce.

For Olympians who are expected 
to pull off crazy twirls over the ice or 
zip around a track without falling, 
the pressure level borders on absurd. 
Entire nations hold their collective 
breath as figure skaters try to nail the 
triple axel and outdo themselves with 
each attempt. Athletes spend their 
entire lives training for three minutes 
of Olympic competition, and with that 
comes a tremendous mental burden. 
When someone takes a spill, the emo-
tion is etched on their face. Unfulfilled 
expectations and concurrent senses 
of resignation, anguish and plain sad-
ness come with the failure to vindicate 
athletes’ faith in themselves. This leads 
some to tell themselves that they’re 
going to fail, largely in an attempt to 
avoid disappointment.

However, underrating our own 
skills can also be dangerous, as 
Beilock showed in another study. On 
a standardized math test, girls who 
had grown up with the notion that 
boys were better at math (which, from 
firsthand experience, is a crazy idea) 
performed poorly; those who hadn’t 
performed just as well as their male 
counterparts. Although thinking of 
oneself as the underdog can occasion-
ally lead to gloriously inspirational 
David and Goliath moments, the blow 
to self-confidence usually results in 
less effort and mediocre results. 

It is admittedly rather difficult to 
find the sweet spot between strato-
spheric expectations and apathetic 
resignation. But if your nerves are 
getting the better of you, it could 
be useful to just try whistling your 
favorite jam.

From hammers to knives, tools helped early humans evolve from Neanderthals to Homo erectus. In the modern day, digital technology is the tool that will help students turn into contributing adults and 
be competitive in today’s economy. President Obama has called for more 
technology in the classroom to enrich student’s education and allow them a 
personal stake in their learning. By modernizing the toolbox that students 
can use in their day-to-day learning, Obama will create an environment more 
conducive to learning.

The ConnectED initiative will carry out the goal of bringing information 
and learning through the use of technology. More than just a government 
venture, the program seeks out the assistance of the private sector, finding 
discounts on the technological tools classrooms will benefit from. And the 
tech titans have responded well: Companies like Apple and Microsoft have 
pledged to donate hundreds of millions of products or discounts on devices 
for public K–12 education. Of course, Obama has also looked to the Federal 
Communications Commission for help. The FCC’s E-Rate program aims to 
connect 20 million students to broadband and wireless connection through 
a $2 billion dollar down-payment. By using executive action, Obama can 
reform education without requiring congressional approval or being bogged 
down by the time it takes to even get it.

The obsession with redefining standards and attempting to find what’s 
wrong with education has turned into a hindrance at this point. The 
Common Core State Standards are representative of this constant worry over 
what students are learning. Yes, guidelines and standards are important, but 
it’s time to step back from making sure our elementary school kids are as 

good as everyone else in the world. It’s time to focus on true enrichment; this 
means giving them resources and not looking at test scores at every chance.

Implementing technology into the classroom allows application of 
knowledge with a personal investment, ensuring the next generation of 
engineers will always be motivated. Apple’s pledge of MacBooks and iPads 
means much more than giving students access to a typing and note-taking 
tool. Those devices represent a development team duo from which apps 
can be coded and tested. Instead of playing game apps, students can start 
making them. Not to be outdone, Microsoft offered to reduce the cost of its 
Windows operating system, allowing schools to determine their own price 
point for each computer. While students will inevitably use the PC for the 
usual Word processing and Internet research, design software firms like 
Autodesk are hoping to expand the use of the computer to facilitate creativ-
ity. They currently offer free computer-aided design software, a tool that can

Quick  Takes on feb 5., 2014, cvs caremark announced its decision to discontinue sales of cigarettes and other tobacco products at its 7,600 cvs pharmacy locations, effective october 2014.

Cigarettes, ubiquitous and dangerously addict-
ing, may no longer be found at CVS pharmacies. 
As a pharmaceutical health care provider and 
America’s second largest drugstore chain, CVS’s 
bold decision to cease selling tobacco products 
could potentially spark fire on progressing efforts to 
reduce tobacco use.   

Hoping for a chain reaction of other drug-
stores and pharmacies following suit may seem 
naive. However, it is not impossible; these busi-
nesses are also providing medications that com-
bat nicotine addiction and diseases exacerbated 
by smoking. It is ironic and more so contradic-
tory to be providing cessation aids alongside the 
instigators of such health adversities. If other 
drugstores decide to follow CVS, regardless of 
their reason, it will be a great step toward curb-
ing tobacco use. 

According to Sheelah A. Feinberg, executive 
director of the NYC Coalition for a Smoke-Free 
City, reducing access to tobacco products will aid 
in the prevention and reduction of youth smok-
ing. Chronic tobacco use begins when youth start 
smoking, so it is important to tackle the problem 
at its roots. It may be difficult to dissuade someone 
who has already made smoking a part of their daily 
routine, but it is easier to prevent those who haven’t. 
If other drugstores and pharmacies decide to stop 
providing these packs of disease, then there is hope 
for improvement.

CVS will inevitably encounter criticism by 
tobacco advocates, as it is the first among major 
drugstores to decide on discontinuing tobacco 
sales. However, for those that accent the healthcare 
aspect of their business, following in the footsteps 
of CVS might not be such an unsavory idea.

Tobacco Ban Should Be Supplemented 
With Educational Campaigns

CVS’s Tobacco-Free Policy Will 
Have Little Effect on Overall Health

CVS Pharmacy Initiative May Influence  
Competitors to Adopt Similar Policies

Earlier this month, President Obama and media 
outlets showered CVS with praise, celebrating their 
efforts to promote overall good health. However, 
CVS’s dramatic move of pulling cigarettes off their 
shelves serves only as a publicity stunt, rebranding 
their name but doing little to improve the overall 
health of Americans.

Because CVS is the only retailer to announce 
removing tobacco products from their stores, 
there are still plenty of alternative places for for-
mer CVS customers to get their fix. Euromonitor 
International reported 47.5 percent of the 290 
billion cigarette sticks sold in the United States 
were purchased from gas stations, while only 3.6 
percent of cigarette sales came from pharmacies 
in 2012. Removing tobacco from CVS does not 
even register a dent on the amount of tobacco sold 
nationally, making the relative impact of this sales 
decision minimal.

The company, according to USA Today, is bet-
ting on a transformation from retailer to a doc-
tor’s office alternative. In a public statement, CVS 
Caremark CEO Larry J. Merlo said that ending 
tobacco sales was the “right thing to do for our 
customers.” However, the decision seems to be cen-
tered on promoting their image and rebranding the 
company into a cheaper and effective alternative to 
regular healthcare. As such, their claims to change 
overall health in the United States are just a cover for 
self-promotion.

According to the Center for Disease Control and 
Prevention, 42.1 million people smoke cigarettes 
in the United States. Obama called their sales deci-
sion lifesaving, but CVS is simply riding the wave 
of national attention to promote their MinuteClinic 
and walk-in flu shots.

While CVS’s efforts to curb cigarette sales are 
a sign of progress, there are more efficient meth-
ods to reduce and prevent tobacco use. In order 
to truly make an impact, policy changes at the 
pharmacy level must be supplemented by health 
reforms and educational campaigns.  

If CVS desires real change, it’s important that 
the focus lies not only in curbing tobacco sales 
at certain pharmacies but also in leading educa-
tional campaigns that will deter tobacco use on 
a larger scale. There has been some progress on 
this front — according to USA Today, the federal 
government recently launched a $115 million 
anti-smoking “Real Cost Campaign” directed at 
youth from ages 12 to 17. This campaign seeks to 
educate at-risk teenagers through television, radio, 
print and online ads that reveal facts and costs for 
health conditions caused by smoking cigarettes.

Halting sales of tobacco at some retailers may 
limit its availability, but it will not educate peo-
ple on the drug’s effects, explicitly discourage its 
use or cause a significant drop in the number of 
people that purchase it. On the other hand, the 
U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention 
states that tobacco usage has decreased by over 
20 percent since 1965. This shrinking statistic 
can be largely accredited to media and govern-
ment initiatives, which have raised awareness 
about the perils of smoking. Smoking reduc-
tion campaigns since the 1960s are proven to 
be effective and have led to better health for the 
American population. 

If drugstores and health providers genuinely 
want to help consumers’ well-being, they need to 
help advocate lifestyle changes, rather than simply 
eliminate the product from their stores.

metaphorical ball in their court; it has 
given it to students and asked them 
what game they want to play. 

But it isn’t enough just to give 
tools — it’s necessary to make sure 
they can access a database that will 
help them learn how to use them. 
The classroom does a pretty good 
job, but a supplement is necessary 
sometimes. Informal sources of 
knowledge, such as educational vid-
eos on math and science provided by 
Khan Academy, or Codecademy, a 
coding website, are provided for free 
on the Internet. A broadband Internet 
connection at school means that the 
computer lab can be an after-school 
enrichment facility rather than being 

relegated to being “that place that has 
word processing”. 

Educators have focused heavily 
on how they can spark interest in the 
STEM field, but they typically lack 
the foresight to consider what hap-
pens after ignition. Teachers have 
given the students insight into how 
the world works, but they have noth-
ing to channel their knowledge into, 
no resource for creativity. According 
to a Pew Research study, the lack of 
resources among low-income stu-
dents prevents 56 percent of teachers 
from incorporating more digital tools 
into the teaching. The ConnectED 
initiative aims to rectify this issue. 
Having more tech in the classrooms 
means students will be able to take 
their knowledge and work it until 

they reach a tangible fruition. 
Obama has been hard at work 

to fulfill his vision of 2014 as the 
“year of action.” The ConnectED 
initiative may not be looking to spe-
cifically attack educational standards 
or directly improve student perfor-
mance, but that’s not his main inten-
tion. Instead, he’s making it more 
obvious to this generation that rather 
than looking for a solution, they’re 
better off creating one. The world 
doesn’t run on test scores and rank-
ings — it progresses through innova-
tion. And students are just now real-
izing how much they can contribute 
towards this advancement.

Low-Income Students Will Gain Skills from Increased Resources

leTTers  To  The  ediTor

Dear editor:
My name is Niall Twohig. I was 

recently interviewed by Justine Liang 
for the Feb. 13 piece on the May 
1970 Peace Memorial.

I would like to submit the follow-
ing letter in response to the opinion 
piece “Fighting Fire”:

I was disheartened to see the 
article about the May 1970 Peace 
Memorial appearing in the same 
issue as the opinion piece, “Fighting 

Fire.” The author hijacks the word 
“peace” to criminalize two student 
activists before their cases have been 
tried in court. This logic of “guilty 
until proven innocent” is an old line 
of reasoning used from witch hunts 
to racial profiling. History shows us 
that this logic is just as incendiary as 
fire. It equates suspicion with guilt. 
It bleeds student activists of their 
deep histories and desires and mis-
represents them as “irresponsible” 
criminals.

Dear editor:
The article entitled “Fighting 

Fire” that you published on Feb. 13, 
2014, which described the Editorial 
Board’s thoughts regarding the 
fires set in Price Center on Dec. 3, 
2013, was a lazy, if well-intentioned, 
piece of writing. It seemed that the 
Editorial Board’s purpose was to 
encourage safer forms of protest. 
However, the Editorial Board’s mes-
sage boiled down to “don’t set fires,” 
a poorly informed, poorly thought-
out and unhelpful opinion.

Furthermore, the article made 
inappropriate assumptions about the 
nature of the incident. The Editorial 

Board assumed that A) the fires were 
started by UCSD students and B) 
the fires were started in protest of 
Starbucks. Neither of these assump-
tions has been confirmed by police.

These assumptions created 
the impression that the Editorial 
Board was assuming the guilt of 
the suspects in the case. In fact, as 
you printed on the front page of 
the same issue, the investigation 
is still ongoing. The editorial was, 
therefore, misleading and could 
have very serious, if unintended, 
consequences.

You would do a service to the 
UCSD community by publishing a 
retraction to correct these errors.

Regarding the Guardian’s coverage of the Dec. 3 
Price Center fires, our editorial board felt the need 
to address concerns over our practices and methods 
employed to report and comment on the story in 
our news and opinion sections.

First, the Guardian Editorial Board is issuing a 
full retraction of our editorial piece, “Fighting Fire,” 
which appeared in print and online on Feb. 13, 2014. 
The piece unfairly implies that the suspects neces-
sarily started the fires in Price Center. The Fifth, 
Sixth and 14th Amendments to the United States 
Constitution provide the right to a fair, speedy 
trial without partiality, and that the presump-
tion of innocence is guaranteed to all accused of 
a crime. These rights were unjustly disregarded 
in our editorial piece, as we unfairly associated 
motives perceived by police as fact and suspects 
as guilty parties. The piece has been removed 
from the Guardian’s website, and we are formally 
disassociating our editorial board, and the entire 
newspaper, with the piece and ourselves.

While the piece overall is unfair and poorly 
worded, we maintain our stance that arson, par-
ticularly when it threatens the safety of students, 
staff and faculty on campus, is wrong and never 
justified. It is unfortunate that this message, 
aimed at whoever actually set the fires, was lost 
among premature accusations, assumptions and 
associations in this piece.

Some comments from our readers have inaccu-
rately identified the Guardian’s Editor in Chief, Ms. 
Laira Martin, as the sole author of the editorial piece. 
The Guardian’s Editorial Board policy, which appears 
alongside editorials weekly in our print edition, attri-
butes editorials to the entire editorial board, as our 
pieces represent the opinion of a simple majority of 
the editorial board, following a vote. Our website’s 
current settings attribute all stories to Ms. Martin by 
default, and in this case, the attribution was an error 
that should have been corrected before the piece was 
published. The by-line was changed as soon as the 
mistake came to our attention.

Our editorial board and news section staff main-
tains that the front-page news coverage was fair. At 
no point did our news story assume the suspects 
were guilty, and the story correctly attributed accusa-

tions and perceived motives to appropriate sources. 
On that note, we would like to address some of the 
content of the article to clarify our news coverage:

• San Diego County Crime Stoppers, the agency 
that published the surveillance footage on YouTube, 
wrote a public Feb. 7 media release on the events, is 
a private organization that logs anonymous tips of 
potential crimes and reports them to county and city 
policing authorities. While the Guardian is not man-
dated to explain the nature of organizations used 
as sources on our news pages, we felt that in this 
instance, our coverage would have been augmented 
by including more information about the San Diego 
County Crime Stoppers’ involvement in the case.

• Our news section staff failed to contact the sus-
pects for comment at any point before we published 
the story, and we acknowledge that it would have 
behooved our news staff to reach out to the suspects 
for comment. We learned of Nguyen’s Feb. 7 arraign-
ment after it had already occurred and therefore 
failed to send a reporter to cover it. Both of these 
would have lent our story more journalistic integrity.

• The still image of the suspects, which came 
from surveillance video footage that accompanied 
the story in our print edition, was provided to us 
by Los Angeles Times reporter Tony Perry and did 
not violate any journalism ethics or protocols. 
He received the footage from San Diego County 
Crime Stoppers. The same images can be found 
on several other news websites, including Fox 5 
San Diego, the Los Angeles Times and NBC 7. 
Although the image is widely available to the pub-
lic, we should have sourced where we obtained 
the image in our print edition.

• A paragraph that noted that one of the suspects 
pleaded not guilty should have appeared at the 
beginning of the story, though its inclusion in the 
story satisfies reporting standards.

We apologize for the unfairness in our editorial 
piece, and we hope that feedback from our reader-
ship on all of our coverage will continue to improve 
our reporting, our professionalism and our ability 
to serve the UCSD community as the campus voice 
for students.

sincerely,
The uCsD guardian editorial board

U CSD physics professor Vivek Sharma is someone who teaches from a textbook, and by the end of the year, he will probably be in one himself. Sharma led an international research team called the 
Compact Muon Solenoid to find a particle in July 2012 that looks a lot like 
the Higgs boson, commonly called the “God Particle.” The Higgs boson is 
hypothesized to be an invisible particle which creates mass and is essential-
ly the Moby Dick of particle physics — physicists have been hunting for it 
for over 50 years. Now, Sharma is working with CMS to verify their results 
and prove that the particle they identified is, indeed, the Higgs boson.

For such a high-stakes project, two teams, CMS and ATLAS, were 
appointed to conduct experiments with independently designed equip-
ment of equal capabilities so that they could check one another’s end 
results. Sharma described the year-long race against ATLAS to find the 
Higgs boson, which started in 2011, as very intense. An average day for 
him spanned from 9 a.m. to 1 a.m., and he never got more than six hours 
of sleep per night that year.

“Once you have that tantalizing hint [that the boson exists], the adrena-
line flows in an incredible way,” Sharma said. “You don’t need to sleep. You 
just live on the thrill of the chase.”

After an adrenaline-filled year of research, the two teams presented their 
findings in front of thousands of scientists at the European Organization 
for Nuclear Research, or CERN, in Geneva, 
Switzerland. Hundreds of thousands more 
viewed the presentation online.

“The atmosphere was like a Super Bowl 
or World Cup,” Sharma said.

To try and catch a glimpse of the Higgs 
boson, both teams used the Large Hadron 
Collider at CERN, which is a 27-kilometer 
ring built 100 meters underground and 
cooled in liquid helium to 1.85 Kelvin 
(-456.34 degrees Fahrenheit), barely above 
absolute zero, the lowest possible tempera-
ture. CMS and ATLAS used this machine 
to smash particles together at speeds just 
three meters per second slower than the 
speed of light. Both teams, who weren’t 
allowed to share their findings with one 
another during their year of research in 
order to prevent bias, collected similar data 
that strongly suggested the existence of a 
particle like the Higgs boson. They both 
demonstrated that there was only a one in 3.5 million chance that their 
similar results were due to chance. 

“At the end of the day, we’re lucky [CMS] didn’t see a pink elephant 
and [ATLAS] didn’t see a green zebra,” Sharma said. “We both saw the 
Higgs boson.”

The search has been in progress since 1964, when James Higgs, a theo-
retical physicist, proposed the existence of this particle in a hypothesis that 
seemed so bizarre to many scientists that Sharma likens it to the Beatles 
song “We All Live in a Yellow Submarine.”

Higgs’ theory suggests that there exists an invisible “field” that fills the 
entire universe and cannot be turned off. Some things interact with the 
field more than others, and the more something interacts with the field, 
the greater its mass. For instance, electrons and protons — what humans 
are composed of — play with the field, so we have mass. On the other 
hand, light particles, called photons, don’t play with the field at all. As a 
result, light is massless. 

Higgs hypothesized that this invisible field is made of invisible particles 

called Higgs bosons. These particles are what play with everything in the 
universe and create mass. In fact, if these bosons didn’t exist, the discipline 
of particle physics would be compromised, since many of its theories have 
already assumed the existence of the Higgs boson. More importantly, if the 
Higgs boson didn’t exist, we wouldn’t either, as the particles that make us 
up would simply fly off into space as massless particles.

Sharma’s fascination with the Higgs boson is rooted in the Hindu 
scriptures, particularly the Rigveda, which he read when he was about 
18 years old. The Rigveda includes the “Song of Creation,” in which the 
ancient sages speculate about how the world and the universe came to be.

“At that time, I figured that 3,000 years later, by using technology, I 
could begin to do research which would answer the questions of these 
ancient sages from thousands of years ago,” Sharma said. “The idea was to 
use the most modern technology to answer these questions and the curi-
osities of our prior generations on how the world came to be. And that’s 
when I decided to go into particle physics.” 

The questions of the ancient sages still remain unanswered, however, 
as CMS and ATLAS have yet to prove that the particle they identified is, 
in fact, the Higgs boson.

“Really, what we could say was that it 
walked like a duck, it talks like a duck, so it 
must be a duck,” Sharma said.

Both experiments need more data 
— more Higgs boson candidates — to 
get more evidence that the Higgs boson 
exists. Thus far, they have already identified 
around 250 of them. Another complicating 
factor is that, for all we know, there may 
be more than one Higgs boson out there 
— possibly even five, as Sharma suggests. 
Researchers still have a long way to go until 
they can say that they have truly found the 
so-called “God Particle.”

Aside from research, Sharma is cur-
rently teaching PHYS 2A, a mechanics 
course, at UCSD and plans to teach the 
same course next winter quarter. But once 
Spring Quarter 2015 begins, Sharma will be 
off to CERN again, just as the LHC reopens 
for the next round of experiments. And 

although the trip from La Jolla to Geneva comprises of 24 hours of travel, 
Sharma still plans to fly to CERN every 4 weeks for his research. 

In the meantime, Sharma and the rest of the CMS team are working on 
publishing results from their race to find the Higgs boson.

“These [articles] are for history,” Sharma said. “This is how we will be 
judged — by our publications.”

Sharma is also around halfway through writing a memoir about his 
experiences while working on the Higgs boson project. Though he’s writ-
ing about the project in past tense, he accepts that the quest for the “God 
Particle” is very much in the present and is far from over.

“Think of a painting,” Sharma said. “[The discovery in July 2012] was 
just a sketch. What needed to be done with the data we have accumulated 
since July 4 was to actually verify and fill in that sketch — complete the 
portrait, to establish the DNA of this particle. This, we are getting close 
to doing.”

At first glance, a giant display board 
with the word “LOVE” on it during 
the week of Valentine’s Day would 
look like nothing more than a festive 
decoration. But with their visual and 
the simple question of “What will you 
do to love yourself?” Revelle senior 
resident assistants Cody Sibulo and 
Esther Jeong aimed to remind UCSD 
students that self-love is, perhaps, the 
most important love of all.

Last week, Sibulo and Jeong headed 
Project LOVE in the Revelle Plaza. 
From Monday to Friday, they chal-
lenged students to think about ways 
in which they could better appreciate 

and take care of themselves. They told 
students to write their ideas down on 
cards and post them on the large dis-
play board. Some of their cards read, 
“[I will] take more time for me” and “[I 
will] accept myself, my successes and 
my failures... through it all.”

Inspired by UC Irvine’s Project 
Up, which explored the idea of the 
role model by asking students whom 
they looked up to, Sibulo and Jeong 
wanted to turn inward even more 
and focus on improving students’ 
own self-perceptions.

“We noticed in the Revelle com-
munity a lack of self-confidence and 
self-appreciation, and we wanted to 
address this issue,” Sibulo said. “Being 
senior resident assistants, we utilized 

our resources to create a program 
about self-appreciation and what it 
means to love yourself.”

At a university known for its aca-
demic rigor, Sibulo and Jeong believe 
that taking time to appreciate oneself 
is essential in maintaining a person’s 
well-being and ensuring a positive col-
lege experience.

“We have seen residents burn 
themselves out by pouring their love 
into their work and relationships 
with other people, without taking 
the time to love themselves,” Sibulo 
said. “Loving yourself is important 
because it has an impact on your 
social, physical and mental well-
being. We noticed that a lack of self-
love leads to a feeling of inadequacy 

and has a negative impact on how 
[students] carry themselves.”

The two Revelle RAs hope to even-
tually encourage all members of the 
UCSD community to take time out of 
their busy lives in order to maintain a 
healthy relationship with themselves.

“The overall goal of this proj-
ect [was] to challenge residents to 
understand the importance of loving 
yourself and how that affects their 
relationships with others,” Sibulo 
said. “We hope to spark discus-
sion in the Revelle community and, 
hopefully, even the larger UCSD 
community about the importance of 
loving yourself.”

But Sibulo noted that the goal 
of the project extended beyond 

reminding students to show some 
self-appreciation; it also served to 
remind students that they both can 
and deserve to love themselves, as it 
is a step towards creating a culture of 
conscious self-acceptance.

“We believe that some people may 
understand that self-love is a privilege 
because one could believe that they 
need to have the right resources and 
circumstances to love themselves,” 
Sibulo said. “However, we want to 
remind residents that loving oneself 
is a conscious decision — and that 
they have the power to make [that 
decision] on a regular basis.”

Learning to LOVE Yourself
Revelle College Resident Assistants Cody Sibulo and Esther Jeong launched Project 

LOVE, a week-long interactive campaign promoting self-love and appreciation.

When UCSD alumna Sophia 
Kim traveled to Hawaii in 2009, she 
immediately fell in love with the 
Brazilian bikini bottoms that many 
sported on the island. The steep 
price tags of these pieces inspired 
Kim to start designing her own 
swimwear during her junior year 
at UCSD. After graduating with a 
Communication degree from Sixth 
College in 2013, she founded a 
bikini company last month called 
Siempre Golden.

“When I first picked [a bikini] up 
[in Hawaii] and looked at the price, I 
realized it was over $160,” Kim said. 
“I thought to myself, ‘Why is this 
little piece of cloth so expensive?’”

After her trip to Hawaii, all she 
could think about was creating a 
more affordable swimwear line that 
would appeal to a broader audience.

“I wanted to provide something 
that high school students and col-
lege girls and [girls in their mid-20s] 
could afford [yet] look stylish [in],” 
Kim said.

She has recently started selling 
items such as “Scrunchy Bottoms,” 
“Shaka Tops,” “Hang Loose Tops” 
and “The Teeny Bikini.” She hopes 
to give back to the environment 
through her sales. For each piece 
sold at prices that range from $35 to 
$45, Kim will donate to the Surfrider 
Foundation, a nonprofit grassroots 
organization that aims to protect the 
world’s oceans and beaches.

“I wanted to combine [my] pas-

sion for keeping the oceans clean 
with my love for bikinis,” Kim said. 
“Every time I make a sale, I know 
I’m one step closer to the main goal, 
which is being a successful company 
that will be able to keep going and 
give funds to Surfrider Foundation.”

Giving back to the environment 
ties in with the concept behind the 
line’s name. 

“‘Siempre’ means ‘always’ in 
Spanish,” Kim said. “To always be 
golden is to think about others, the 
world and the environment.”

After getting a trademark for the 
brand name, Kim took some busi-
ness management and marketing 
classes at UCSD to learn more about 
starting her own company. She also 
sought the advice of the owner of 
Surf Diva, a boutique in downtown 

La Jolla where she interned as an 
undergraduate.

The hardest part, Kim said, was 
finding someone to manufacture her 
designs, which have unique, braided 
features that complicate the produc-
tion process.

“I tried to find sources in the 
states, and it was just impossible,” 
she said. “I knew I had to go some-
where else. This person would take 
me to the next source and the next 
source, and every person told me, 
‘[I] can’t do this for you, it’s just too 
time-consuming.’”

It wasn’t until her recent trip to 
Bali, Indonesia that the young entre-
preneur was able to find a manu-
facturer. Afterward, she spent five 
weeks making sure all the samples 
and designs were correct. 

Now, Kim is working to publi-
cize her swimwear line. She’s already 
had several photoshoots for her line, 
some of which feature current soror-
ity girls from UCSD’s Delta Gamma 
and Pi Beta Phi. She also launched 
a Kickstarter this past Saturday in 
which her swimwear went on pre-
sale online.

But regardless of how well her 
company does, Kim is determined 
to pursue her philanthropic goals of 
giving to Surfrider Foundation.

“Even if I don’t make that much 
money or I don’t have that great of 
an income in the beginning, that’s 
not going to prevent me from reach-
ing my goal,” she said.

Bikinis for Beaches
UCSD alumna Sophia Kim has created her own swimwear line, Siempre Golden, which 

donates a share of its proceeds to help conserve the world’s oceans and beaches.

and McCullough, who will be hon-
ored before the game. After their final 
homestand next weekend, UCSD will 
wrap up its season with two games on 
the road.

“We have to have a really good 
week of practice in order to be playing 
well the coming weekend,” Klie said 
when asked how the team is preparing 

for its remaining games. “The focus 
has to be there the whole week, and 
then it’s just coming out Friday night 
and executing and playing harder than 
they will. We do those things, and the 
results will take care of itself.”

With only two weeks left before the 
CCAA tournament and still one spot 
out of postseason contention, UCSD 
is under immense pressure to win its 
remaining four games. UCSD will face 

San Francisco State (10–8) — which 
currently has the final tournament 
spot — at RIMAC next Friday in 
what will likely be the most important 
game of the season. If the Tritons win, 
they will be tied for the sixth and final 
CCAA tournament bid and will con-
trol their own postseason fate.

freestyle, moving him up from No. 3 
to No. 2 in UCSD record book. For 
his performance, Li also earned the 
PCSC Male Swimmer of the Meet.

Senior Erika Rodman and soph-
omore Kyle Nadler also swept the 
first-ever PCSC 1,000-meter free-
style events. Rodman set a personal 
record, moving her up from No. 4 
to No. 3 in the UCSD record book. 
Nadler, with his first individual con-
ference title, also managed to set his 
own personal record and moved 
from No. 8 to No. 2 in the UCSD 
record book. 

On Thursday, the Tritons 
strengthened its first place spot with 
Li breaking the school record in 
the 500 freestyle and three other 
individual events. The men ended 
the day with 699 points, followed by 
Concordia Irvine at 389, while the 
UCSD women led with 627 points.

Senior co-captain Anji Shakya 
became a four-time champion in the 
500 freestyle after placing first again 
this year, having set the school and 
meet record last year. Shakya was 
followed by her teammates fresh-
man Sierra Gage and sophomore 
Jessica Norgaard to win the event 
1-2-3 for the second year in a row 
for UCSD. 

Sophomore Colleen Daley 
grabbed her first individual PCSC 
title in the 50 freestyle with junior 
teammate Sierra Robbins placing 
second right behind her. Shakya, 
Daley and Robbins were joined by 
freshman leadoff Austine Lee to 
placing first in the 200 free relay, 
earning her fourth straight title in 
the event. 

“The leadership of our four 
senior captains and the performanc-
es from Anji Shakya, Nick Korth, 
Luke Calkins and Paul Li helped 
keep our team on track through 

seven grueling sessions,” UCSD 
head coach Matt Macedo said after 
the meet.

Senior co-captain Nicholas 
Korth won his first individual PCSC 
championship in the 50 freestyle. 
Korth was followed by five other 
Tritons to the final, including senior 
co-captain Alex Merrill. All six of 
the men ended with season-best 
markers and, for some of them, their 
career best. 

On Friday, the Tritons won eight 
of the 14 combined events on the 
day. The men accumulated 1,192 
points and women had 1,101, both 
groups with a comfortable lead over 
its conference opponents. 

Li added on to his impressive 
performance by winning both the 
400 individual medley and 200 free-
style. Freshman Zach Yong broke the 
school record for the 400 individual 
medley and co-captain Shakya won 
the 200 freestyle, while Korth won 
the 100 breaststroke. 

Macedo and Falcon were pleased 
with UCSD’s overall performance.

“I am not only proud of how 
they swam and dove, I am also very 
proud of the way they came together 
as a team.” Falcon said. “Our team 
performed well and really supported 
each other during stressful sessions.” 

With the conference champion-
ships now behind them, Macedo 
now has his eyes on the team’s future. 

“I am excited to see what we 
can accomplish next month at the 
NCAA championships in Geneva, 
Ohio,” he said.

UCSD will not know how many 
of its swimmers will qualify for 
the NCAA National Championships 
until Sunday, Feb. 23. The National 
meet will be held March 12 to 
March15.

The UCSD men’s volleyball team 
was swept by University of Southern 
California and Pepperdine University 
at RIMAC Arena last week.

Now 13 games into the season, 
the Tritons have found themselves in 
a tough spot. Having lost all 12 of its 
conference matches so far, UCSD is 
now dead last in the Mountain Pacific 
Sports Federation conference rankings 
(0–13 overall and 0–12 in conference).

“We play the game to win — that 
hasn’t changed for us,” UCSD head 
coach Kevin Ring said to the UCSD 
Athletic Department. “We are still talk-
ing about trying to win these matches, 
but we’re looking at what we do during 
the week, during the practice and we 
try to make some improvements along 
the way”.

As of late, Ring has made some 
changes in his lineup, one of which was 
switching senior setter Mike Brunsting 
to play as an opposite hitter. The 
change paid off, as the senior collected 
no fewer than 29 kills during the last 
two matches.

“He’s been very open for that [posi-

tion change], and he’s one of our more 
athletic players on the team,” Ring said. 
“It’s nice to have a 6-foot-5-inch leftie 
setter that can go and play opposite. 
We’ve had some injuries this year, we 
had to make some changes, so we are a 
little thin, but he [Brunsting] has taken 
the role, and I think it’s an advantage.”

Friday night UCSD hosted confer-
ence opponent USC in RIMAC Arena. 
Losing to the Trojans by scores of 
25–13, 25–21 and 25–15. The Tritons 
took the first two points of the match, 
but the Trojans won the next three, and 
despite three subsequent Brunsting 
kills, the guests steamrolled their way 
to a 11–5 lead in the first set and domi-
nated the rest of the game. 

The second set saw eleven tie scores 
and four lead changes, as the Tritons 
led at the 17–14 mark. But UCSD, who 
has struggled in tight games, lost the 
advantage, as USC tied the set-up at 
19–19 and ultimately won 25–21. 

The following night the Tritons 
took on No. 3 nationally ranked 
Pepperdine in another home game, 
losing by scores of 30–32, 16–25 and 
25–27. 

The first set had 15 tie scores and 
three lead changes. Tied at 20–20, the 

Waves finally took the set home after 
several set points. 

Pepperdine controlled the sec-
ond game throughout. Tough serves 
and efficient attacks forced UCSD 
to make errors on their end of the 
court. However, the Tritons came back 
strong in the third set with help from 
Brunsting, who notched six of his 17 
total kills in the third frame. Staving off 
a Pepperdine match point, the Tritons 
tied the score at 24–24. 

But two subsequent Triton errors 
made the job easy for Pepperdine, 
whose 25–27 win was its sixth straight 
against UCSD.

Together with Brunsting, red-
shirt sophomore outside hitter Kirill 
Rudenko led the UCSD offense with 
16 kills during the two matches. 
Sophomore libero Elliott Shaw collect-
ed eight digs Friday night and reached 
a career- and match-high with 10 digs 
for UCSD Saturday.

UCSD will return to the road this 
the week to play No. 13 Cal State 
Northridge on Wednesday, Feb. 19 and 
No. 6 Cal State Long Beach on Friday, 
Feb. 21.

decision, he's kept pretty busy: carving a niche as a quality 
underground beatmaker that people call when they want 
something special. In between, he found time to complete a 
break beat album entitled 'Blockhead's Broke Beats,' with ten 
hard-hitting instrumental tracks, which was released on Mush 
Records, the US home of cLOUDDEAD. Undergraduates with ID

Tritons Bounce Back During Road Trip UCSD Splits Crucial 
Conference Away Games

WOmen'S  baSkeTball men'S  baSkeTball

UCSD wins two conference games, snapping their recent four-game losing slide.

Basketball struggled against Monterey Bay but 
rebounded with a dominant victory against East Bay. 

After losing four straight games, 
the UCSD women’s basketball team 
bounced back on Thursday, Feb. 13 
with a 56–48 road win against Cal 
State Monterey Bay, followed by a 
59–50 road victory on Saturday over 
Cal State East Bay. The Tritons are 
now in a three-way tie for fifth place 
in the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association.

On Thursday night, the Tritons 
shot just 33 percent (17–52) from the 
field, and were only 1-for-18 from 
beyond the arc, though UCSD still 
managed to secure a crucial confer-
ence contest.

“[It was] a rather unattractive 
game,” UCSD head coach Heidi 
VanDerveer said. “In the first half, 
we had been on a little slide, but I 
think at halftime our team really 
decided they wanted to set the tone 
for the rest of the year. [We] came out 
and played really hard.”

At the half, UCSD gridlocked at 
a score of 23–23. The Tritons broke 
ahead early in the second period, 
going on a 10–0 run to take a 37–30 
lead. The Tritons held the advantage 
for the rest of the night. 

Senior forward Erin Dautremont 
led the Tritons to victory against the 
Otters, earning her fourth double-
double (13 points, 10 rebounds) 
of the season against Cal State 
Monterey Bay.

“She can take over a game,” 
VanDerveer said. “She can score in a 
variety of ways, and she had two or 
three plays in the second half that real-
ly got us the separation we needed.”

Junior guard Miranda Seto ended 
the match with 16 points, while senior 
guard Megan Perry also racked up 13 
points, along with two steals. 

The following night, UCSD took 

on Cal State East Bay. Both teams 
desperately sought a victory as they 
came into the game stuck in a four-
way tie for fifth place in the CCAA 
conference.

The Tritons found themselves 
down 14–2 soon after the tip. 

Freshman forward Cassie 
MacLeod then led UCSD on a 13–0 
run of its own — scoring eight points 
herself during the spree — to help 
the Tritons gain the lead.

“Cassie is very talented, and I 
think [she] is going to be a great 
player for us,” VanDerveer said. “The 
game was kind of like a snapshot of 
what I think she can do consistently.” 

The Tritons closed out the half 
with a score of 29–20, an advantage 
they would only extend throughout 
the rest of the night. 

UCSD shot a solid 39 percent 
from the field and out-rebounded 
the Pioneers 42–31 for the game. 
Perry led the Tritons with 14 
points, while MacLeod tallied 12 
points along with a team-high eight 
rebounds. 

“In the bigger picture, [winning 
the game] was something we had to 
do in order to get to where we want 
to go,” VanDerveer said. 

After the successful weekend on 
the road, the Tritons now have only 
four games remaining to qualify 
as one of six teams chosen for the 
league tournament.

“We need everyone getting bet-
ter so our team can get better,” 
VanDerveer said. “We’ll focus on 
what we have to do this weekend and 
not look too much further ahead.” 

The Tritons will round out their 
home schedule this week when 
they host San Francisco State on 
Friday, Feb. 21 and Sonoma State 
on Saturday, Feb. 22. Both games 
will start at 5:30 p.m. at RIMAC 
Arena, with Saturday’s game preced-
ed by a ceremony honoring UCSD’s 
four graduating senior players: Kim 
Manlangit, Rachel Marty, Megan 
Perry and Erin Dautremont.

The UCSD men’s basketball team 
was unable to extend its three-game 
winning streak this weekend, fall-
ing to Cal State Monterey Bay 70–57 
before bouncing back the following 
night to defeat Cal State East Bay 
83–67. UCSD remains at .500 with a 
9–9 conference record. The Tritons 
have only four games remaining in the 
regular season and are ranked seventh 
in the California Collegiate Athletic 
Association standings.

The Tritons struggled to shoot the 
ball against Monterey Bay, converting 
only 33 percent from the field and a 
dismal 23 percent from three-point 
territory. Relying heavily on perimeter 
shooting, UCSD scored only 57 points, 
nearly 15 points below its season aver-
age. The Tritons would also struggle 
from the free-throw line, making only 
61 percent of their free throws, miss-
ing nine potential points that would 
have kept the game close enough to 
mount a comeback. Furthermore, only 
two players scored in double digits: 
Senior guard James McCann finished 
the night with a game-high 21 points 
and nine rebounds, while sophomore 
guard Hunter Walker added 14 points 
and eight boards.

Still missing senior forward 
Mackenzie McCullough and sopho-
more center Zach McMillan due to 
injury, the Tritons’ lack of size and 
transition defense allowed Monterey 
Bay to take advantage near the rim, 
outscoring UCSD 34–22 in the paint.
The game had eight lead changes and 
was tied at 15–15 by the seven-minute 
mark in the first half. However, UCSD 
would never take the lead after that 

point and never led by more than two 
points in the entire game.

Freshman guard Adam Klie, soph-
omore forward Drew Dyer and red-
shirt freshman guard Aleks Lipovic 
had an underwhelming performance, 
scoring a combined 16 points on 
4-for-21 shooting.

“We just didn’t play good enough 
to win,” Klie said. “I don’t think it was 
because we weren’t making shots and 
defensively we weren’t great. We didn’t 
really have that edge to our game that 
we have had more recently and it 
showed in the box score.”

However, the Tritons would shoot 
better the following night, sinking 
8-for-20 attempts from beyond the arc 
and shooting 60 percent in the second 
half to extend their lead to 19 points 
against East Bay. UCSD also scored 
20 points off of 15 East Bay turnovers.

“I think mentally we were sharper, 
especially on the defensive end,” Klie 
said. “It helps when you hit a couple 
shots especially in the second half, but 
it came down to just being really tough 
and getting some defensive stops, and 
I think we did that.”

The Tritons also had a more, well-
rounded performance compared to 
the night before, as four players scored 
in double digits. Walker scored a 
game-high 23 points and grabbed five 
rebounds. Bouncing back from their 
disappointing performances, Klie and 
Dyer stepped up to score 14 points 
and 17 points, respectively. Klie also 
had eight rebounds while Dyer had 
four off the glass.

Next Saturday will mark the 
final home game for Triton seniors: 
McCann, senior guard Matt Bailey

Swimming for 
Sixth Straight

 PCSC Title 

SWimming  &  DiVing

UCSD takes the crown at the 
Pacific Collegiate Swimming and 

Diving Conference Championships.

After four days of competition, both the UCSD men and women’s swim and dive teams managed to win their sixth 
straight title at the Pacific Collegiate Swim and 
Dive Conference Championships Feb. 12 to 15. 
The Triton men tallied 1,604 total points, while 
the women recorded a score of 1,565 — both 
beating out the closest competitors by more than 
300 points.

“It was one of the best conference 
championships we’ve had in a long 
time,” UCSD head coach Corrie Falcon 
said.  “Almost every person got a [per-
sonal record], and we broke five school 
records.”

The Triton women entered the 
meet with an 8–6 record, ranked No. 

5 nationally. The men, with a record of 3–4, are 
currently ranked No. 9 nationally. 

On Wednesday, the first day of the meet, the 
Tritons started off by shooting straight to the top, 
winning six out of eight events. The Triton men 
ended the first day with 300 points, accumulated 
by placing first in all four events that were held 
that day. UCSD’s closest competition came from 
Fresno Pacific, which racked up 140 points. 

The Triton women held 253 points over 
Division-I competitors Pepperdine (175), 
University of Alaska Fairbanks (172) and Azusa 
Pacific (170). 

UCSD sophomore Paul Li set a personal 
record in the opening 200 yards for the 800
