AS Commissioner questioned 
on use of student body funds 

by Andy Schneider 
Associa&e News Editor 

Bob came to me and said that he couldn't get 
around on public transportation and this was the 
only type of car available. All I could do was 
believe Bob. After he rented the car, I wouldn't 
let him take per diem . It Travel expense 
vouchers, in one case signed by Leifer, do show 
that Drapeau received $60 in per diem from 
University Hall for the two trips. 

Student Activity Fee Funds were used by AS 
External Affairs Commissioner Bob Drapeau to 
rent a Hertz Firebird. The rental bill came to 
$52.81 to cover 55 miles of travel during the two 
day Regents meeting on Oct. 20 and 21 in San 
Francisco. When asked for comment Drapeau 
responded laughingly, "My wife had a baby, 
twins in fact. Print that and I'll send a copy 
home to mother." 

On Nov. 18 and 19 student funds were again 
used by Drapeau to drive 133 miles in a Monte 
Carlo during a two day trip for meetings in San 
Francisco and Berkeley. This time the bill came 
to $79.19, but President Jeff Leifer would not 
approve reimbursement for more than $50., 
which was paid out by the Associated Students. 

Drapeau added that .although he did not give 
testimony, his presence was important during a 
discussion of UC admission requirements . 
"There was a time factor involved," he noted. 
One statewide source indicated that Drapeau 
w as not present at the Regents meeting during a 
crucial vote in which a move to reduce student 
fees failed. 

Drapeau commented that the car he rented 
had" a bordello red interior which J thought was 
disgusting and 1 was embarrassed to be seen in 
it." On a more serious note he said that PSA had 
been responsible for the Hertz reservation. 
When asked why the Hertz agreement form 
indicates a requested preference for a Firebird 
Trans Am, he said, " I might have asked for a 
Capri, and 1 got a Monte Carlo, it was the only 
one they had. " 

A call to PSA at San Diego Airport provided 
the information that upon arriving in San 
Francisco the Airport Limousine leaves every 
few minutes. It takes you downtown non-stop in 
thirty minutes for $1.40. From there the Regents 
meeting can be reached by a short city bus ride. 

When asked about funding controls, Leifer 
answered that" the AS has a tight ship program. 
I've only made one trip and I returned unused 
per diem to the AS account. Nobody in San Diego 
gets paid for their effort." He pointed out as a 
comparison Da·vis has over 100 people on the AS 
pay roll and the student president at UCLA 
makes $250 a month. 

A representative from the Hertz Rental in San 
Francisco who refused to be identified to the 
press indicated that the company attempts to 
provide the type of car requested. "I can't 
believe that we only had full size cars available, 
especially since reservations were made," she 
said. 

AS President Jeff Leifer, who approves all 
allocations from the $62,479 rtudentgovernrmmt 
budget emphasized that the practice of renting 
cars is "just unacceptable. It was only in San 
Francisco and under unusual circumstances. 

Figures released as public record by the AS 
Business Office indicate that over nine trips 
Drapeau has received $171.25 in per diem for 
meals (not counting the recent San Francisco 
trips) and $168.26 for parking, tolls and taxi , 
some of which included parking his personal car 
at the airport. Drapeau offered to go over the 
records claiming that a good portion of the 
expense must have been recharged to the 
University administration. 

Chinese educators tour UCSD 
as part o~ American visit 

by Laura A. Rieh&er 
New. Editor 

We' re being watched. 
As part of a month-long stay 

in the U.S., a 10-member 
Higher Education delegation 
from The People's Republic of 
China arrived in San Diego last 
Friday for a four-day visit to 
obse rve university-level 
trai ning of scientists and 
technical personnel and work of 
research institutes. 

While UCSD activities were 
the focus of their attention, with 
Monday set aside for·a campus 
tour, the group also found time 
to tour the San Diego area, 
including the Salk Institute and 
the zoo at Balboa Park. "We 
were quite interested in your 
zoological gardens. We also 
have one in Peking, but not 80 
big as yours," commented 
Yang T'ine-pao, dele,ation 
leader and a prominent 
architect who currently serves 
as the Vice Cbairman of the 
Revolutionary Committee of 
Nanking Engineering College. 

New coaceptioDi 
. T ' i ng-pao spoke of his 
Interest in architectural desip 
and the compariaon between 
V.S. and Chinese approach •. 
:'Your emphalls is put more 
Into new conceptionl of 
architectural p1anniq aDd new 
ways of makjq use of buildiDJ 
materlall ... lie-also took notice 
of contraaUne methodl of 
constructien and of the new 
types of building materials 
beinl produced In this country. 

ical, as there is only limited 
need for transportation of the 
materials. Also, our emphasis 
is not on the appearance of the 
building." 

T' ing-pao said that factories 
are constructed quickly in 
China. " It is important that 
they be completed on time so 
that the workers can be located 
in the area. Of course, itdoesn't 
mean that we are entirely 
ignorant of the appearance of 
the building." 

A transplant 
The success in transplanting 

Australian eucalypti to the San 
Diego area was impressive to 
T'ing-pao. "The natural settiDg 
of the place is too dry for plants. 
What is otherwise barren and 
uninteresting has become a 
beautiful green area and 
beautiful setting for a college 
compound. " 

Jan Berris, proeram director 
for the National Committee on 
U.S.-China Relations, which 
spl)nsored the delega lion's 
visit and that of the table tennis 
team in 1972, said the group has 
all ready travelled to Berkeley 
and Stanford and has yet to stop 
in Los Angeles, Dayton, 
Oberlin-Cleveland, New York, 
Boston and Washington D.C. 

Berris commented that the 
delegation was impressed to 
see the amount of money that 
loes into science training in the 
U.S. She noted that they "loved 
the Exploratorium in San 
Francisco. Those are the types 
of things that they will take note 
of on their tour." 

Berris, who will accompany the 
delegation throughout their 
U.S. tour. She said that 
interaction between Chinese 
delegation members and their 
American colleagues was 
facilitated because most of the 
visitors can speak English .

mended Richard Armitage of 
Ohio St. , Melvin Bernstein of 
UC Irvine, Edward Shaw of 
UCLA and Richard Whitehill

Times has learned. 

The search committee , 
which was formed by Chan-
cellor McElroy to weed out 
applicants for the vice-
chancellorship. recommend-
ed Armitage with near 
unanimous support, accord-
ing to ources clo e to the 
search committee and the 
administration . 

"Some Support" 
Bernstein, Shaw and White-

hill were recommended to 
McElroy with "some sup-
port," although committee 
members indicated they are 
" de ply divided" over all 
three, the sources said. 

The Chancellor, who re-
ceived the committee's 
recommendation Monday, 
picked the 13-member com-
mittee in June, and directed it 
to study prospective replace-
ments for George Murphy, 
who resigned the vice -
chancellorship in April. 

McElroy will make the final 
decision from the four 
candidates recomme nded by 
the sea rch com mittee. 
Physical Education Chair-
man Howard Hunt has served 
as interim Vice-chancellor 
si nce Murphy' re ignation. 

Armitage was supported by 
most of the committee 
because he received good 
marks from all the campus 
groups that met with him and 
from people who have worked 
with him in the past, accord-
ing to sources. 

Armitage, 59, has served in 
a variety of positions at Ohio 
St., where he started working 
in 1954. He is currently Vice-
president, Student Services, 
and has also been dean of the 
graduate school and univer-
sity ombudsman.

UC Irvine since 1972, both in 
the tudent affairs depart-
ment and as a lecturer on the 
American Presidency and the 
Study of Law. He is currently 
Assistant Vice-chancellor for 
University and Student 
Affairs.

started his academic admini -
trative career as Dean of 
Placement and Career 
Planning Center . He i 
currently Assistant Vice -

and Development. 

" In oar country, we have to

From Cuba 
with grace 
Alicia Alonso 
dances "Giselle" 

by Jill Louise Bazeley 
Ar1s Writer 

If virtuoso perfor m a nces 
were made of feelings , last 
weekend's " Giselle," featuring 
the a ging Cuba n ballerina 
Alicia Alonso, certainly would 
have been one. To a capacity 
audience in the Civic Theatre, 
Alons o a nd The Sa n Diego 
Ballet gave it everything they 
ha d in t e rms of poi se a nd 
enthusiasm and were amply 
rewa rd e d wi t h th e mo st 
heartfelt applause I think I' ve 
every heard or seen. Unfor-
tunate ly, howeve r , a ll the 
exuberance in the world could 
not change age to youth, nor 
hide the fact th a t Alonso's 
performa nce was technically 
very flawed. This Giselle was 
ailing not only in fiction , but in 
fact, and a ll the character's 
protestations about having a 
weak heart did not belie the fact 
that Alonso is not only past her 
prime as a ballerina, but a lso 
dow nr ight frai l. Still , s he 
carried it 0(( with a grace that 
was truly touching and proved 
that a performer need not be 
perfec t to hand in a g reat 
performance. For this I think 
the many bravos and all the 
applause were appropriate , but 
I must question the taste of 
bravoing and applauding a fter 
the execution of steps that for a 
younger da ncer would have 
been a ma tt e r of co u rse . 
Methought they did protest too 
much - it was morbid to be 
reminded so constantly by the 
a udience th at Alonso was 
pulling 0[( a feat even in the 
simplest of movements. She's 
not a trained seal, after a ll. 

Alonso's pa r t ne r , Jorge 
Esquivel, must also be given 
credit for his relentless poise 
and tremendous rapport with 
and concern for her. Alonso, 
who is partially blind, and who 
has in recent years danced only 
with the 27 year old Esquivel 
beca use of t he security he 
a[(ords her , depended upon him 
a great deal, but therewaSJlary 
a hint of this in his perform-
a nce , wh ic h was ni ce l y 
executed with a great deal of 
amplitude and flair, but was by 
no means stunning. 

The San Diego Ballet Com-
pany, also a iling, but in the 
financia l way, was in its best 
form for this production .
