Pledging to improve the quali-
ty of the undergraduate student 
experience and foster new collabo-
rations with the private sector, 
Marye Anne Fox was formally 
inaugurated as UCSD's seventh 
chancellor in a ceremonial proces-
sion at RIMAC Arena on March 3. 

The ceremony began with a 

70-member procession that 
included inaugural speakers, mem-
bers of the UC Board of Regents, 
national laboratory directors, 
chancellors from other UC cam-
puses and other acaderruc leaders. 
The procession was fo llowed by 
welcorrung remarks for the new 
ch.mcellor from student, staff and 
commuruty representatives. 

"I first met Dr. Fox about a year 
ago [and] today 1 am just as 

impressed with her abilities as 1 
was back then," A.S. President 
Jenn Pae said. "From the begin-
ning, I knew that she would be a 
wonderful asset to our community. 
She is dedicated and caring, and 
most importantly, a good listener." 

Graduate Student Association 
President Kris Kohler also extended 
a welcome to Fox, while challenging

Food Co-op satellite 
agreement finalized 

By BENJAMIN BARTLm . 
Staff Writer 

The Food Co-op will open a 
second store in Price Center, 
under an agreement brokered 
among the university, Associated 
Students and co-op officials on 
March I. 

"Students have wanted a low-
cost food alternative in Price 
Center for quite orne time now/' 
A.S. President Jenn Pae said. "h's 
great that we came together to 
make this happen." 

The satellite store is scheduled 
to open in approximately 60 days, 
and will serve a variety of alterna-
tive foods and drinks. 

"We're very excited and strong-
ly look forward to serving students 
in the Price Center," said John 
Walton, a principal member of the 
Food Co-op. "We're expecting to 
have a different constituency, 
bringing a new atmosphere and 
service to Price Center." 

Specifically, the co-op will serve 
food free of preservatives, color-
ings, additives or proce sed cherru-
ca ls, according to the finalized 
space agreement. 

Unlike the original co-op, the 
new store will feature a hot food 
bar, serving products such as rice, 
curry and stir-fry. Likewise, many 
of its original products like Che 
Cafe-made burritos and sandwich-
es, Juice Evolution drinks, chips 

and cookles will be served, Walton 
said. 

" I think it's great they're adding 
omething new and different in 

Price Center," Thurgood Marshall 
College senior Ililary Bettinelli-
alpin said. "It will be a cool break 
from the typical commercial junk 
food." 

The idea for a second food co-
op location arose everal yea rs ago 
when a space in Price Center 
became available. Polls taken in 
2002 showed that the majority of 
students were interested in an 
organic food store. ince then , 
lease negotiations between the 
university and the co-op have 
been ongoing. 

According to the space agree-
ment, both Associated tudents 
and the Graduate Student 
Association will maintain certain 
oversight responsibilities over the 
lease as official representatives of 
UCSD students. Specifically, they 
will work to certify that the Food 
Co-op is acting in the best interest 
of students, and that it remains 
"financially solvent." 

In accordance with this respon-
sibility, the A.S. Council reviewed 
and unanimously approved relevant 
sections of the space agreement. 

The co-op will pay $178 in rent 
per month, adjusted monthly for 
inflation as measured by the

SRTV pulls plug on York Marshall students 
. reject adivity fee hike 

By WlWAM CHING 
Staff Writer 

Thurgood Marshall College 
students voted to reject a $4-per-
quarter student activity fee 
increase, which would have gener-
ated an additional $43,000 a year, 
in a week-long special election held 
last week. 

Of 3,710 registered Marshall 
students eligible to vote, 696, or 19 
percent voted on the referendum. 
Approximately 48 percent of tu-
dents voted in favor of the referen-
dum, while 52 percent voted 
against the measure, according to 

Marshall Student Council Director 
of Finance Steve Geist. University 
poHcy requires fee increases to be 
passed by a simple majority, with at 
least 15 percent of eligible students 
turning out for the vote. 

"Every year we get less and less 
funding from A.S., and basically we 
don't have enough," Marshall 
Student Council ChaIT Becky Lee 
said prior to the announcement of 
the results. "We hope to pass the 
initiative to keep the current pro-
gramming. It will help level the

Student-Run Television had

off his clothes on camera, SRTV 
Programming Manager Patrick 
Reynolds pulled the plug on the

"J personally didn't feel that 
any ample warning was made," hc 
said. 

The fate of the how is still 
uncertain, according to York.

Fox: Cost more than double 
that of Dynes' inauguration 

cDIltinued from page I 
the chancellor to lead the universi-
ty to help create a better world. 

"Why shouldn't the UC, one of 
the finest public universities in the 
world, lead a movement of truly 
free discussion and debate, crossing 
borders of ethnicity, race, gender, 
class, sexuality and nationality?" 
Kohler said. "In short, why can't we 
be the first generation of Americans 
to put people above profits?" 

In welcoming the audience, 
UC Board of Regents Chairman 
Gerald L. Parsley emphasized the 
significance of the chancellor's 
inauguration. 

"The investiture of a new chan-
cellor is a landmark event in the life 
of a campus and in the life of the 
people that the university serves," 
Parsley said . "The regents look to 
the chancellor to inspire, energize 
and lead the campus, so that the 
university may fully realize its 
promise for California's future." 

UC President and former 
UCSD Chancellor Robert C . 
Dynes presided over the official 
ceremony. 

"We have much to be proud of 
at UC San Diego," Dynes said. 
"And we are adding immeasurably 
to the rich history of this campus 
with the inauguration today of 
Chancellor Marye Anne Fox . ... I 
have just a bit of a personal stake 
in what happens at this campus, 

and I am confident that with the 
leadership of Marye Anne Fox, it 
is in very good hands." 

After an address from UC 
Irvine Chancellor Ralph J. 
Cicerone - the new president of 
the National Academy of Sciences 
- Fox came forward with her 
own remarks on the origins of 
UCSD, its role as a public univer-
si ty and her vision for the future. 

"Generally, I hope to lead the 
campus in continuing to identify 
and recruit smart people to our 
faculty and staff, to provide a 
structure that supports them in 
doing important things, and to 
get out of their way," Fox said. 

The event ended with an all-
campus buffet lunch on RIMAC 
Field. 

The inauguration event cost a 
total of $79,100 paid for by the 
regents and the UC Office of the 
President, more than double the 
$32,000 spent on Dynes' inaugu-
ration in 1996, the San Diego 
Union-Tribune reported. 

A well-known chemist and aca-
demic leader, Fox was named 
UCSD's chancellor in April 2004. 
Before coming to the university, 
she served as chancellor of North 
Carolina State University until 
1998.

I BRIEFLY 
Lawmaker calls for 

meningitis vaccination 
College students living on campus 

will need to provide €Vidence of a 
meningitis vaccination under a new 
bill introduced by Rep. Robert E. 
Andrews (D-NJ.). If approved, the 
proposal would modify the Higher 
Education Act - a law goveming most 
federal involvement and funding in 
higher education - to force universi-
ties receiving govemment funds to 
require the vaccine. 

The law would apply to all stu-
dents 18 years or older who apply for 
admission or attempt to register for 
classes at a postsecondary institution. 
Minors would be exempt from the 
requirements. 

In addition, the law would allow 
students to opt out of the vaccination 
by signing a written waiver, stating 
that they reviewed information on the 
disease but chose not to receive an 
inoculation. 

For schools that do not keep 
waivers or medical records showing 
that students have been immunized 
on file, the law authorizes the 
Department of Education to reduce 
the amount of govemment adminis-
trative allowances provided to cam-
puses for coordinating campus-based 
federal financial aid. 

The bill has come less than a 
month after the Center for Disease 
Control and Prevention's Advisory 
Committee on Immunization 
Practices reversed its earlier stance 
and passed a resolution calling on all 
college freshmen to receive the vac-
cine. Previously, it had said that gen-
eral vaccination would not be cost 
effective. 

The disease, though very rare, 
appears at a higher frequency among 
college students living in on-campus 
residential halls. 

Bill calls for private 
work-study use 

A bill introduced by Rep. David Wu 
(D-Ore.) would require college uni-
versities to indude private, for-profit 
organizations in the administration of 
their work-study programs. Current 
law allows for, but does not mandate, 
universities to use frivate vendors in 
the coordination 0 the employment 
program. 

As originally created in 1965, 
work-study prOVides federal money to 
students as financial aid in the form of 
matching salary funds. The money is 
distributed to universities, which then 
divide it among needy students. To 
receive the did, students must work 
for an approved employer, with the 

••• 

money used to pay a portion of their 
total wa~es. 

Traditionally, most of the money 
had been used for on-campus posi-
tions and at nonprofit organizations. 
However, Wu's bill would require that 
universities use a portion of the 
money to subsidize wages of low-
income students working at private 
companies. 

The bill has been referred to the 
House Committee on Education and 
the Workforce. 

New bowel disease 
treabnent found 

Scientists at UCSD School of 
Medicine, with colleagues in Japan 
and Israel, have shown that a new 
typ~ of therapy using special types of 
proteins was successful in treating 
two types of inflammatory bowel dis-
ease in mice. 

Printed in the March edition of the 
Journal of Ciinicallnvestigations, the 
researcher's findings show how the 
treatment is used to reduce the sever-
ity of an immune system malfunction 
that attacks the gut 

Though used on mice, researchers 
say the findings will help them under-
stand how the proteins work to 
reduce inflammation involved in 
Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, 
two painful, chronic conditions that 
affect nearly one million Americans. 

Three beetle groups 
missing testis 

Scientists at UC Berkeley have 
found that a surprisingly large number 
of beetles in three beetle families are 
missing their left testes. The findings, 
they say, are unusual because the 
process of natural selection has tend-
ed to favor populations with symmet-
rical body structures. 

"We've got two lungs, two kidneys, 
and females and males have paired 
gonads. Even our brain has two hemi-
spheres," UC Berkeley assistant pro-
fessor of insect biology Kipling VViIi 
stated in a university press release. 
"Evolution has predominantly favored 
bilateral symmetry in animals, so 
when we see that the rule is violated, 
as in the case with these beetles, it 
gets our attention." 

However, the beetles in question 
are not the first organisms to have an 
unusual population missing testes, 
and researchers said the anomaly 
does not inhibit the beetles' normal 
functions. 

''The beetles with one testis are 
mating normally and doing their bee-
tle thing. H Comell University professor 
of entomology James Liebherr stated.

. Food: New Price Center 
location to open in 60 days 

Video: Council intends to amend charter 

continued from page I 
Consumer Price Index, which is 
published by the United States 
Department of Labor. The lease 
covers a period of 24 months, giv-
ing the co-op the option to extend 
for four successive two-year peri-
ods. 

The deal has come amid ongo-
ing, and at times turbulent, negoti-
ations over the space currently 
occupied by the original co-ops. 

In October, the university 
threatened to evict the four co-ops 
- Groundwork Books, the Food 
Co-op, the General Store and Che 
Cafe - when negotiations for a 
new lease stalled. 

The university argued that the 
Memorandum of Understanding, a 
document that outlined the general 
lease agreement, had expired. As a 
result, university officials wanted to 
renegotiate the agreement to allow 
for greater oversight of co-op oper-
ating procedures. 

The co-ops, on the other 
hand, had claimed that the MOU 
had no legal date of elCpiration, 
and was therefore not open to 
amendments. 

Although the university backed 
away from the threat of eviction, 
the parties have been involved in 
negotiations since November. 

Currently, all parties involved in 
the discussions have signed a confi-
dentiality agreement and would not 
comment on the current progress of 
the negotiations. However, a press 
release issued by Campus 
Ombudsperson Judith Bruner stated 
that she was somewhat optimistic. 

"All of the co-ops, the adminis-
tration and A.S. and GSA are con-
tinuing their good faith negotia-
tions regarding the other co-op 
space agreements," stated Bruner, 
who is mediating the talks .

The unanimous council reso-

lution followed a campus investi-
gation concluding that, while 
York 's broadcast was not in viola-
tion of Federal Communications 
Commission guidelines, it did 
breach the SRTV charter, accord-
ing to Universiry 
Communications Director 
Dolores Davies. 

"The finding was that FCC 
regulations do not apply to SRTV; 
because it is a closed-circuit sta-
tion," Davies said. "The adminis-
tration feels that the underlying 
agreement and understanding is 
that the purpose of SRTV is to 
enrich the university experience, 
which we don't believe [the show) 
did . What we would really like to 
see is A.S. to take this seriously 
and review the charter and per-
haps make it clearer." 

The resolution also expressed 
the council's intent to amend 
SRTV regulations to clarify 
obscenity guidelines. Some A.S. 
senators said they felt they needed 
to act before harsher measures 
were taken against SRTv: 

"The student, administr-a tive 
and public response was such that 
we had to do something," Revelle 
College Senior Senator Ted 
McCombs stated in an e-mail. "I 
believe there was a significant 
danger of the administration step-
ping in, and I th ink we did the 
responsible thing and kept that 
from happening." 

University administrators said 
they were satisfied with the resolu-
tion, praising A.S. Council of taking 
responsibility for SRTV content. 

"I'm very pleased that A.S. has 
taken the leadership role," 
Assistant Vice Chancellor of 
Student Life Carmen Va zquez 
said. "Given their responsibility, 
it's highly appropriate that our 

Resolved: A.S. Elections Manager and Koala Editor Steve York looked from the 
audience as the A.S. Council passed a resolution condemning his SR1V broadcast 
student leadership take the 
responsibility for determining 
paramerers for programming." 

" I believe there was a 
significant danger of 
the administration 

stepping in ... "

College senior senator 

SRTV is funded by Associated 
Students through self-assessed stu-
dent activi ty fees. York's "Koala 
TV" is an offShoot of the campus 
publication the KoaIlJ, which has 
printed controversial sexual and 

racial humor in the past. On March 
4, around 100 students, faculty and 
staff organized a speak-out against 
the publication. 

At the A.S. meeting, York 
spoke during a public-input ses-
sion and promised to contest the 
resolution "with all avail able 
resources at my disposal." He also 
defended "Koala TV' and said the 
council lacked the legal knowl -
edge needed to make decisions on 
free speech rights, which he con-
tends allow for such a broadcast. 

Welch spoke on behalf of 
SRTV; citing legal precedents that 
did not allow governing bodies to 
regulate indecent material. 
However, council members avoid-
ed legal matters by proposing 
amendments that they said would

Outreach fees justified 
Students can afford to make small sacrifice 
By KELLY GILBERT 

Staff Writer 

You've seen the signs around 
campus: "Your three dollars can 
make a difference," "Join a cause," 
These of course refer to the 
upcoming fee referendum, which, 
if passed, would tack three bucks 
onto our bills once a year in order 
to help fund student-initiated out-
reach , 

And it's.true: Your three dollars 
can make a difference , As 
California residents and UC stu-
dents, we should support the ref-
erendum, 

The referendum is facing some 
opposition mostly because of the 
principle behind it; students are 
concerned that if we make a refer-
endum to help this cause (a slight 
break from the tradition of wholly 
student-oriented self-assesed fees), 
before we know it, the governor 
will suddenly start hitting students 
up left and right for cash - to 
fund better wages for UC workers, 
maintai n the grounds at La 
Estancia and the like, 

But voting to pass this one ref-
erendum won't put us in danger of 
suddenly finding ourselves 
contributing "just another 
$50 a quarter" to fund 
reconstruction of Marye 
Anne Fox's house, or any-
thing of that nature, On 
the contrary, the whole 
process of voting for it 
should safeguard us against 
unwanted future referen-
da, 

If Associa ted 
Students passed the: 
fee referendum with-
out a vote - or, hor-
ror of horrors, if the 
regents themselves 
tried - you might as 
well kiss your diplo-
ma goodbye and 
transfer to San Diego 
State, In a university 
where everything 
from the cost of a 
Naked Juice to 
tui ti on fees has 

increased drastically even since last 
year, we can't afford to throw 
money at every new fee hike or 
textbook surcharge or referendum 
that comes our way, And to indi-
cate that we're willing to do so 
could indeed be the end of afford-
able public schooling, Sure, it'd be 
equally disastrous to suggest that, 
as students, we're a money tree for 
all the areas in which California 
could use some extra cash, 

Voting "yes" on this fee refer-
endum, however, isn't giving 
Sacramento any kind of carte 
blanche to our savings, It's simply 
saying that we believe in the indi-
vidual cause presented to us, we 
have considered the benefits of 
donating our money ro it, and we 
have decided, collectively, that this 
particular instance is one in which 
we're willing to give a few extra 
bucks because we choose to. The 
principle to worry about here is 
the vote itself. 

In the future, a better prece-
dent still would be to vote on the 
amount of 
the ref-
eren-

dum as well. To do so would send 
an even stronger message that stu-
dents are indeed in control of how 
and why we spend our money. 

And three dollars~ We're not 
asking for a week's wages here, 
Voting to pay an extra three dollars 
means foregoing one gallon of gas, a 
small salad at Sierra Sununit or a 
recycled viewing of "Elf' at Price 
Center Theater. Over the course of 
a quarter, that's not going to break 
you. 

The three bucks that you'd be 
giving if the referendum passes 
would go to support student-initi-
ated outreach programs, which, in 
this case, would help fund ·K-12 
programs. As students who, pre-
sumably, went through such pro-
grams ourselves, it's a good idea to 
make a conscious choice to give 
something back. 

It's true, of course, that there 
are countless groups in California 
with more money than your aver-
age UC student. (This is fortunate; 
otherwise, California would be a 
poor, poor place.) And it would be 
ideal for the mega-billionaires 
from Orange County and the dot-
com CEOs from San Jose to pitch 
in and write checks next to which 
our fifty thousand would pale in 
comparison. But if we just sit 
around and expect the wealthy to 
fund solutions to California's 

problems, we're setting 
another - and also 
pretty dangerous -
precedent: Let tile rich 

ones solve things, 
Perhaps if we step up 

and make a donation 
to a worthy cause, 

those with the funds to 
really make a difference 

will do the same. 
The best news - and, 

in fact, the only

good news 
about the insanely 
inflated tuition fees 
we find ourselves

Rain brings out UCSD's colors 

Aftertaste 
Evelyn Hsieh 

San Diego has gotten its fair share of rain these past couple months. We're all familiar 
with it by now. Rain pounding on 
rooftops, sometimes so heavy it 
sounds like hail. There is the occa-
sional roar of thunder and £lash of 
lightning. Like a traveling circus, 
the storm theatrics pop in and then 
hardly leave any signs of their pas-
sage the next morning. Just call it 
the T.1ste-of-Life-in-Seattle Tour. 
Instead of the Space Needle, 
though, we get a layer of broken 
tree branches covering perfectly dry 
concrete, as if nothing happened. 

Mo t of the time, I don 't mind 
the rain so much . Getting caught 
without an umbrella, stumbling 
through the drops .,' all I need is 
some Dido in my iPod to turn it 
into my very own mind movie: 
drama by way of cold and warm 

fronts. Sleeping in on rainy days is 
pure, cozy bliss, It's nice to know 
that even California has seasons, 

The sad thing about the rain is 
that it extinguishes life on our 
campus, Suddenly, the campus 
population seems to have dwindled 
from thousands to hundreds. Price 
Center is a dreary, gloomy mess, 
sending students scampering into

quarter's many rainy days 
have only accentuated the 
beauty and vitality of our 

campus during the

thc claustrophobic Cove. Library 
Walk booths are reduced to empty 
gray tables , The colors from a mil-
lion student fliers bleed ontO the 
ground and into the cracks. And 
the poor eucalyptus trees - once 
tall and glorious - lie helpless, 

rootless, on the dirt. The talking 
trees are more alive than they, 

Because of the preceding gloom, 
though, the sun shines all the 
brighter on our little Eden by thc 
sea, Especially after a few days of 
wind and rain, a piercing blue sky 
and a steady 68 degrees are more 
than welcome. Sun is always great, 
but UCSD sparkles in the sun like 
Cinderella during the ball . Why? 
Because life is found everywhere. 

At a university known for its 
love affair with the study of life sci-
ence, everyone complains or a t least 
acknowledges its dearth of campus 
life. Yet to me, this quarters many 
rainy days have only accentuated 
the beauty and vitality of our cam-
pus during the surmy ones. 

Library Walk is a good exam-

scattered student organizations, 
the weekly Farmers' Market has

Sudan in crisis 
while world yawns 

By ISlA YAGHOUII 
Senior Staff Writer 

If thousands are massacred and 
no one sees it, did it really happen? 

If thousands are massacred and 
one of the world's most powerful 
nations identifies it as genocide, will 
anyone try to stop it? 

I suspect that this piece probably 
won't grab your attention. You see, 
I'm about to address yet another 
conflict that has ravaged a region of 
Africa, and, honestly, who gives a 
damn about Africa? 

Perhaps we should, since for the 
past 40 years, that continent's largest 
country, Sudan, has been experienc-
ing one of the longest civil wars on 
the globe, a civil conflict that has 
reached nightmarishly brutal levels 
in the past few years. 

A short and simplified synopsis of 
the recent escalation: Since February 
2003, violence has plagued Western 
Sudan, leaving 70,000 dead and 
more than a million forced from 
their homes, For the past two years 

" 

Where are the concerned students 
visibly protesting the raping of 
women, the raiding and burning of 
villages and farms, the poisoning of 
wells and the murder of thousands, 
including children~ Where are the 
efforts to raise money and supplies 
for aid? Where are the petitions to 
local congresspersons and criticism 
of the international community for 
taking no penalizing action against 
the Sudanese government in 
Khartoum? 

In the case of the tsunami, we can 
all shake an angry fist at the heavens, 
curse the shifting of tectonic plates, 
throw a few coins in a tin can and 
move on. It seems the political com-
plexities of Sudan's conflict have 
become reason enough to explain 
the deafening silence in the face of 
such man-made horror. This silence 
has been attributed to sympathetic 
Arab countries, which have opposed 
sanctions on Khartoum's Arab gov-
ernment, or countries like China and 
France, "whose firms have sunk a lot 
of money into Sudanese oil wells," 

according to the 
Economist. 

Why isn't there 
anything close to [the 
tsunami relief effartsl 

in response to the 
thousands in Sudan 
affected by similar 

Even more con-
fusing is the lack of 
interest among 
major media out-
lets, which for the 
longest time 
reported very little 
on the atrocities in 
Sudan, Media 
attention has 
grown slightly 
since former 

in the Darfur region 
of Sudan, Arab mili-
tiamen called the 
Janjaweed have 
obliterated villages, 
murdering thou-
sands and displacing 
more than a lnillion. 
These militiamen 
have been given sup-
port by the Arab 
SuJanese govern-
ment to put down 
uprisings by the 
regions non-Arab 
Muslims. 

, " Secretary of State 
Colin Powell offi-lSSueS ..• 

The violence has 
soared in the last year, To this day, 
hwnan rights groups estimate that 
thousands are displaced every week, 
and many continue to die due to the 
J anjaweed, disease or starvation, and 
farmers who weren't killed off have 
fled to refugee camps. Darfur is 
going through its worst food short-
age in decades, Two harvests have 
thus been lost, wi th a third loss 
looming, according to the Wall Strut 
Journtll, 

TIme magazine recounts the hor-
ror as reported by Darfurian eyewit-
ness Melkha Musa Haroun: .. ," the 
Janjaweed fighters on a rampage 
deciding whom to kill spotted a one-
year-old boy and decided he was a 
future enemy, In front of a group of 
onlookers, a man tossed the boy into 
the air as another took aim and shot 
him dead," 

When the December tsunami hit 
Southeast Asia and the Indian 
Ocean, countless student organiza-
tions climbed over themselves in a 
tsunami of response announced via 
the campus list-serve, including 
fundraising and donation drives 
camped all over Library Walk, For 
months, countless media outlets 
wrote about it daily, almost ad nause-
am, complete with heart-wrenching 
photographs and interactive media 
online, 

While this is all necessary and 
commendable, it begs the question: 
Why isn't there anything close to 
this in response to the thousands in 
Sudan affected by similar issues of 
lost homes, starvation and disease? 
These are not victims of an unpre-
ventable force of narure. The inno-
cents of Darfur are victims of a very 
preventable and stoppable campaign 
carried out by forces that must be 
held accountable and penalized. The 
excuse of benign ignorance is no 
longer possible. 

Where are the voices of student 
organizations calling for justice? 

cially declared the 
conflict to be "genocide" last sum-
mer and Congress finally verified his 
statement in the fall, 

As UCSD students, we have our 
studies, an abundance of student 
organizations, sports and part-time 
work to keep our hands full, and so 
perhaps we rely on passive sources of 
information rather than carefully 
reading the newspapers, In doing so, 
we run the risk of missing out on 
imoortant issues like the one in 
Sudan, The fact is, we really do have 
the time to pay some attention to 
what is going on in the world. I've 
seen that we are energetic and will 
go the extra mile for causes we find 
important, 

While I luxuriously lap a latte at 
the Living Room in La Jolla, I'll 
read, with no small discomfort, of a 
woman in Furbaranga, Sudan, who 
is ferreting by on a fixing of grain 
seeds, An interest in global affairs 
may not come easily and may not 
always be uplifting, but it5 necessary 
to develop. Reading about what's 
going on, especially /i'om varied per-
spectives, leaves me feeling like less 
of a lenuning leaping into the latest 
issue without knowing why. 

As students, our purported goal is 
the pursuit of knowledge, and the 
attempt to obtain the tools to learn 
outside the classroom after gradua-
tion day, The need to meet thi s goal 
and pay attention to the world is 
especially acute since the mistakes of 
the past are now being repeated at a 
dizzying rate. Remember when the 
world recoiled at the horrors of the 
Holocaust and loudly incanted 
"Never Again"? Yet about a decade 
ago on the continent of AlTica, et!)-
nic cleansing left 800,000 dead, 
Does Rwanda ring a bell? 

What can students do? At the 
very least, we should pay attention, 
show concern, ask questions, talk to

~ IUnERS TO THE EDITOR 
Israel OAP funding 

still in doubt 
Dear Editor. 

Beginning with the title, Patrick 
Allen 's Feb, 28 article ("OAP to 
restore study in Israel") is incorrect 
and misleading, I would like to cor-
rect the erroneous information 
therein, which has already led sev-
eral people to make plans based on 
false assumptions. 

As I told Allen, there is nothing 
definite about our restoring formal 
OAP procedures for study in 
Israel. I explained that we are 
exploring, with input from the 
campus counsel, the use of a spe-
cial waiver to enable snldents to go 
through the UCSD Opportunities 
Abroad Program to study in Israel. 
Any use of such a waiver by UCSD 

would first have to be cleared on 
several levels, including the cam-
pus counsel, the Chancellor's 
office, the Office of the President 
and the systemwide Senate 
Committee on International 
Education, Because we have been 
working in good faith on behalf of 
students interested in studying in 
Israel, I agreed to speak with 
Allen. Unfortunately, he took that 
opporrunity to make inaccurate 
statements on the subject. 

Since last fall, the general prac-
tice in the Programs Abroad 
Office has been to share informa-
tion with students about the 
options available in Israel outside 
of Education Abroad Program, 
along wi th the credi t transfer 
process, and how to petition 
courses upon their ro!turn. 
Heeding both the UC systemwide 
policy and the continuing height-
ened State Department travel 
advisory for Israel 
(http ://trllvel.stlltt.gov/trllvt//cis-J111 
_t'Wltwltw_922 .html), we have 
stopped short of implementing 
formal OAP procedures and forms 
that require our approval and sig-
natures , We know that some 
UCSD students are following this 
advising path, enrolling in pro-
grams in Israel and transferring 
their credits back to UCSD. 

We are aware that, along with 
the use of a strongly worded special 
waiver, a few private colleges and 
universities are allowing students to 
go to Israel, but that doesn't apply 
to the University of Califotnia until 
or unless the current UC policy is 
changed. 

As you know, the safety and 
security of UCSD students 
abroad is of the utmost impor-
tance to us, and our policies stem 
from this concern. Because we are 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

aware that a few other institutions 
in the country are supporting 
their students studying in IS'rael, 
we have been revisiting the cur-
rent policy about OAP advising 
for Israel. 

I hope this clarifies our 
approach at this time.

- Principle members, Queer 
People of Color 

Heterononna~ 
needs to be challenged 
Dear Editor: 

The principal members of 
Queer People of Color would like 
to correct some misconceptions 
about our Feb. 14 "Kiss-In" held 
on Library Walk . There's been 
some confusion about what the 

Kiss-In was and why we held it, 
Partly this is due to the GUIlrJilln'r 
choice to discuss the event in the 
Opinion pages without bothering 
to run a srory in the News section, 
but most of it, we feel, is due to the 
very things we're fighting: homo-
phobia and heteronormativity. 

First: The Kiss-In is an annual 
event put on by QPOC, not, as has 
been reported, the Lesbian Gay 
Bisexual Transgender 
Queer/Questioning Intersex 
Association. At the Kiss-In, we dis-
played images of same-sex affection, 
sold buttons and had same-sex cou-
ples lcissing during passing periods. 
It speaks to the heteronormativity 
of our school that these activities 
should be seen as "provocation." 

Heteronormativity is a complex 
word that stands for a simple mis-
take: the idea that because straight 
is the majority, straight is the 
default, Why do people assume I'm 
straight unless I wear a rainbow? 
Why are there no same-sex 
Valentine's Day cards in the book-
store? Why is same-sex affection 
considered so shocking that the 
GUIlTditm writer conflated our Kiss-
In with Student-Run Television 
pornography? 

In her Feb. 28 opinion article 
("Freedoms don't have to be excer-
cised"), Kelly Gilbert frames the 
Kiss-In as a free-speech demonstra-
tion to say, "Hey, we exist!" We do 
exist, obviously, but this was not the 
driving issue, Today's culture dis- . 
plays a tolerance for our existence, 
but nothing more . The "Queer 
Eye" men can teach you how to 
propose to your girlfriend , but they 
themselves can't marry. Will can 
have an NBC sitcom, but not a 
boyfriend on it. We can theoreti-
cally have queer relationships, but 
we can't ki ss in front of you whi Ie 

OPINION 5 

you're eating. 
Gilbert describes the Kiss-In as 

"borderline obscene." But kissing, 
hugging and hand-holding hasn 't 
been considered anywhere near 
"obscene" since the '50s - the 
1850s, The idea that we have to 
confine this affection to private 
spaces is exactly the sort of homo-
phobic hogwash we're sick of. 

The Kiss-In was not a demon-
stration of free expression; it was a 
celebration of something beyond 
existence: our love. It was a protest 
against an attitude that heterosexu-
al PDAs are, at worst, a nuisance, 
while two dudes kissing on Library 
Walk are "a freak show." The 
GUllTdill7l's appalling respOnse to us 
merely confirms how necessary the 
Kiss-In was in the first place.

Add in the quarterly Vendor Fair 
and Library Walk is transformed 
into a bustling avenue; it's actually 
quite exciting to see everyone 
stroll around under the sweet sun. 

Stand still. There are people on 
the blocks. There are people with 
food and posters. There are smiles. 
There are friends. There's life. 
There is a cheesy columnist grin-
ning madly like a psycho at our 
quirky school. With all the com-
motion, one might forget that it is 
UCSD, except for Geisel Library 
protruding from the background. 

That Geisel, as weird as it 
looks, is also a source of pride. The 
mirrored glass windows reflect the 
white pillows of clouds and watery 
blue, a piece of art in itself. Plus, 
last week was the IOlst birthday of 
Dr. Seuss (Theodor Geisel). As in 
all the o'ther years, UCSD pulled 
out all the stops with a giant inflat-
able Cat in the Hat, a giant inflat-
able pink birthday cake and 2,000 
free slices of cake and frui t punch 
for all to enjoy. Throw in the 
Teeny-Tiny Pit Orchestra and 

staffers in tall hats, and it's a short, 
yet delightful and whimsical 
respite from classes and the norm. 

Price Center is the epicenter of 
activity under the sun. The trees are

swirling with the slightest whisper 
of the wind. People congregate in 
the plaza, soaking in the rays and 
music with friends. Everything 
from the UCSD Gospel Choir to 
the band of the day to readings and 

lectures and dance performances 
has been displayed at Price Center. 
During the recent Fusion Kick-off, 
it was really, really hard not to shuf-
fle your feet in quasi-dance under 
the table, or at least bob your head 
to the beat. As Usher sings, you get 
"Caught Up" in the performances 
and the music, even though Price 
Center music is always a couple of 
decibels higher than needed for 
pleasant conversation. 

It might be my senior-year 
mindset speaking, but UCSD 
really isn't as dead as its reputation 
has it. Do you ever feel like some-
thing blooms right in front of your 
eyes; when you didn't see all that 
much before? It's kind of like that. 

So, sure, we don't have the cul-
tural vibrancy of Berkeley, or the 
ritziness of Westwood and UCLA. 
But let me tell you, I was a pretty 
happy camper eating my Dr. Seuss 
cake with my friend standing 
underneath a metal tree in front of

mini piano and harp on a perfect 
day. That's UCSD, baby.

real position. At first she tells us, 
"We have never turned away a stu-
dent and we never will. " It seems 
as though she is taking a stand 
agai nst the tyranny of the majority, 
as though she will make sure every 
student has a voice on her station. 
Later, though, she tells us, "SRTV 
is student-run. Students pay for it. 
Students decide what they want to 
see." Now it sounds as though 

she's trying to defend students' 
rights to avoid paying for the pro-
duction of films they would rather 
not see in the first place. Indeed, 
how many students are the 
"enough" needed to stop showing 
smut? Either of the positions she 
seems to take would be admirable 
in many ways, but it seems that 
Welch wants to take both of them! 
The real purpose of her lener 
seems to be to let the KOIlJa staffe rs 

out to dry rather than state SR1V 
policy. What exactly is the station 
manager's position - will she 
quash free speech at the behest of 
the mob, or will she continue to 
allow our increased fees to pay for 
what the majority seems to feel is 
ei ther unethical or simply not 
cost-efficient?

'Fee: Fewer than one in five 
students voted in close poll

leges." 

Freshman H elen Chan said she 
voted to reject the referendum 
because she felt it was unnecessary 
and didn't benefit the students who 
would end up paying the higher 
fees . 

"I understand why the council 
members proposed such an initia-
tive, since they are just finding a 
way to improve students activities 
at Marshall," she

dents, while also providing funds 
to allow for the continued growth 
of organizations, according to 
Geist. 

Marshall students last voted on 
student fees in winter 2002, when 
they instituted the 52 quarterly 
charge, which was implemented 
the following fall quarter, accord-
ing to Lee. 

Lee said she voted for the initia-
tive because the fee increase pro-

vides more oppor-
said . "But I don't 
think raising the 
student fees by an 
extra $4 is the way." 

M arshall Senior 
Senator Kate Maull 
sa id ' that she 
thought it would be 
a good idea to 
"modestly raise the 
student fee," but "i t 
looks like the stu-
dents didn 't agree," 
she said. 

Our financial 
situation is pretty 

bad right now, and it

"absolutely benefi-

students." 

M a r s h a ll 
S o ph o m o r e 
Senator Jason 
Hoskins said he 
also supported the 
fee increase 
because the funds 
would hel p

"I feel sorry for

to suffer next year because we don't 
have enough money for them," 
Maull said. "Our financial situation 
is pretty bad right now, and it will 
only get worse next year." 

T he new fun ds would have gone 
to events such as the college com-
muter board's TGI Friday's events, 
Winter Wonderland and 
Marshallpalooza. 

M arshall has the lowest self-
assessed student activity fee of the 
six colleges, at $2 per quarter, and 
takes in little more than $30,000, 
according to Geist. If passed, the 
newly generated funds would also 
have been available to all campus 
organizations. 

The college would have 
increased the council's annual 
revenue from $34, 100 to $77.600 
in stu dent-assessed fees. Council-
members' proposed the increase 
to $6 because it would all ow the 
body to maintain the current 
level of services and program-
ming available to all Marsha ll Stu-

"Whi le acade-
mics is the highest 

priority at our university, it is our 
free festiva ls, programs and recre-

assessed fees are not tu ition 
increases, which are forced increas-
es. Student-assessed fees arc fees 
students approve in order to 
increase the events, service and 
fa cilities that they have available to 
them during their university expe-
rience." 

The vote was coordinated sepa-
rately from the spring A.S elections 
because Marshall Student Council 
members didn 't want the initiative 
to "get lost" amid the spring elec-
tion, according to Lee. T he vote 
was conducted online, similar to 
the format of campuswide elec-
tions. 

"Voting onl ine is easier and 
more accessible to students," Lee 
said . "It makes it a fair election."

PRAGUE, CZECH REPUBLIC 
By HANS FELLMANN 

Features Editor 

P rague is like a heathen dream and a gothic nightmare, molded to form the black jewel in the crown of European capitals. Its horizon is 
pierced by dozens of dark, jutting spires. Its main 
bridge, the Karluv Most, is lined on both sides with 
hunched ghoulish figures, that gla~e at passersby. 
And at night, its cobblestone streets are jammed 
with hundreds of green-eyed, half-drunken teens 
searching feverishly to quench their fix for absinthe. 
If the devil threw a party, he'd do it in Prague. 

ACCOMMODATIONS 

Those looking for a quiet little getaway to relax 
and kick back should go waste their trip somewhere 
else. Prague's hostels are solely for dumping off 
bags, getting trashed off hallucinogenic liquor 
before heading to the clubs, and crashing at 7 a,m. 
in a drunken stupor. The ideal spots for this are 
Travelers' Hostel Dlouha (Roxy; 24 82 66 62, hos-
tel@trovelersroxy.cz, Dlouha 33) and Clown and 

Bard Hostel (22 71 64 53, Borivojova 102, 
Prague '3; metr~:-Jiriho;z Podebrad). Dorm 
beds at both hostels are available for $9 per 
night, while a bed in a double room runs $11 
to $12 dollars. 

AOIVITIES 

Prague's nightlife is bangin', plain and sim-
ple. Its nightclubs are packed thick with gangs of 
ravenous backpackers and crazy Czechs guzzling 
alcohol and blowing up the dance floor. The No. 1 
nightclub, bar none, is Karlovy Lazane, the biggest 
club in Middle Europe (Novotneho lavka, Stare 
Mesto). Entrance costs 6$, but it's well worth it. This 
club is four solid floors of thumping techno and 
electric light shows. Aside from the dance area, 
each floor also has its own lounge and bar with 
numerous sofas that are made to provoke a little 
sex and sin. If enough people order absinthe, the 
bartender will take a shot himself, grab a Zippo and 
blow fire across the ba-r. This gets the juices flowing 
after a few shots of the ·ween fairy." 

The debauchery continues at the upscale Club 
Radost FX (Belehradska 120, Prague 2; metro: IP 
Pavlova). Radost was voted one of the top 20 clubs 
in the world by British Club magazine, and it does-
n't take a logician to figure out why. The club boasts 
an extensive dance floor, world-famous European 
DJs, a bar that serves 390 different drinks and a vel-
vet, Asian-style lounge with golden-mirrored alcoves 
for those looking for a little more privacy. Entrance 
is also about six bucks. 

Prague isn't just about its nightlife, though; the 
sights seen during the day make Paris look like 
Bakersfield, Calif. 

Dominating the city from atop a hill in central 
Hradcany (the castle district) is Prague's greatest 
testament to gothic architecture, the Prague Castle. 
It was founded in the ninth century and has gone 
through many successive add-ons and remodelings 
since then, making it an absolutely enormous struc-
ture. 

As it stands, there are two main sections of the 
castle: the Old Royal Palace and the Vitus Cathedral. 

Inside the palace, the main hall (Vladislav Hall) is so 
massive that it holds an extensive wooden ramp 
where armored knights on horseback would con-
duct live jousting tournaments to the death. The 
Old Royal Palace was also the site where, on May 
23, 1618, the Thirty Years' War began after two bel-
ligerent Protestant nobles chucked a pair of Catholic 
councillors from a top-story window. 

Directly behind the Old Royal Palace is Vitus 
Cathedral. Its pair of rigid steeples can be seen tow-
ering behind the palace like horns, and its entrance 
is riddled with ornate carvings and decadent glass-
work. The interior is composed of a grand hallway, 
whose arches stretch to the heavens and cradle 
dozens of vibrantly colored stained-glass windows. 
The cathedral houses the tomb of King Wenceslas, 
among other famous Czechs, as well as the coun-
try's beautiful crown jewels. Tickets good for three 
days of visiting are sold in the front of the castle at 
the Chapel of the Holy Cross for 120 Czech crowns 
($3). 

On the opposite side of Karluv Most is Stare 
Mesto, the old quarter. In its center is Prague's old-
est and grandest medieval square, Staromestske 
Nam, whose biggest attractions are definitely the 
Tyn Church and the Astrological Clock. Legend has 
it that the ey~of!the-man who designed the clock 
were plucked from his skull by the king of Bohemia 
to ensure he ,could never replicate his masterpiece 
for any other city. Also worth visiting near the 
square is the Klementinum, or state library, which 
houses more than 3 million books from around the 
world . 

FOOD 

Tightwads should head to Prague's Zizov and 
Smichov neighborhoods for cheap eats. But those 
gluttons willing to shell out a few extra bucks to 
gorge themselves on real Czech fare must eat at 
Staromestske. At Staromestske Restaurace, guests 
arc served liters of premium beer and plates piled 
high with tender, grease-dripping meat. Dining can 
be done either inside or al fresco in the middle of 
the square beneath the stars. A plate of food and a 
beer here run from about $3 to $8. For something 
a bit more exotic, Fakhreldine (Stepanska 32) 
serves fantastic Lebanese cuisine for $5 to $10 a 
plate. 

TIANSPORTATION 

The best way to get to Prague is by train, arriving 
from Berlin (5 hours); Nuremberg (6 1/2 hours); Linz, 
Austria (5 1/4 hours); or Budapest (10 hours). 

Just outside of Prague is the quiet, unassuming town 
of Kutna Hora. Nestled in its center is the Sedlec 
Ossuary, the town's main attraction. From the outside 
it's nothing more than a weathered, gray church with 
tombstones scattered around it But the inside hosts a 
ghastly secret Decorating the walls and the ceiling are 
the bones of some 40,000 corpses. In the center of the 
room is a sight straight from a Dahmer dinner party: A 
chandelier, made almost entirely of human skulls, 
hangs in front of a statue of Christ pinned to a crucifix 
made of bones. Around it. stacks of bleached femurs 
and skulls are piled as if just gnawed on and licked 
clean. 

Getting to Kutna Hora is quick and painless. Seven 
trains run daily from Prague's Praha-hlvani Nadrazi. The 
whole trip takes about 45 minutes to an hour.

CHANGE OF LATITUDE : < 
EDITION ~~~tw.'t~ ~ 

Zacatecas, Mexico Catalina Island, California 
By EWN MCDOUGALL 

Contributing Writer 

Z acate.cas, a small town in the northern part of Mexico filmous for its silver mines, is 
a delight to behold. 

Arriving on the bus may not ini-
tially give this impression, since the 
outslcim are really nothing special, 
but the inner city is full of beautiful 
architecture and intricate stone 
carvings, and - best of all - it's 
pink. 

The town is nestled in a valley, 
which provides some wonderful 
views especially from the cable car 
that runs between two of the peaks. 

It's possible to combine this trip 
with a visit to the silver mines, 
where visters can ride on a tiny lit-
tle train through the caves, which is 
great fun . 

As far as sightseeing goes, 
there are the characteristic fea-
tures of a Mexican town -
plazas, cathedrals, markets and a 
variety of small museums spe-
cia lizing in such things as 
archaeology, Mexican political 
history and an. The town offers 
an incredible theater from the 
colonial period , boasting stun-
ning woodwork and frescoes. 

There are regular perfor-
mances, and it's often possible to 
just wander into a show for an 
insight into Mexican traditional 
dance and music, not to mention 
wild and slightly bizarre costumes 
- including something resembLing 
a big box made of wh.ite feathers 
worn as a hat. Since the town is 
quite small , all of these attractions, 
including the cable car, are within 
walking distance from each other. 

One of the most appealing fea -
tures of the town is the excellent 
youth hostel, the Hostel Colonial, 
located in the town center. It's 
cheap ($5 per night for a bunk) and 
very clean, and was established 
only three years ago. The owne.rs 

are very friendly and will meet 
guests at the bus station, cook din-
ner the first night and even take 
them out drinking later. 

A rooftop terrace olfers views 
over the town and a big margarita 
tank, which is completely free -
perfect to get into the spirit of 
spring break. 

FOOO 

Although. the hostel's kitchen 
is fully equipped and numerous 
market stalls and small food shops 
cater to travelers on a budget, the 
town also features some great 
restaurants serving typical 
Mexican delights. 

There is also, rather strangely, a 
Greek ice cream parlor serving 
banana splits, baklava and, of 
course, Greek ice cream. 

ACTIVITIES 

The nightlife is vibrant, largely 
due to Zacatecas' status as a wliver-

the day the town seems quiet and 
laid back. There are a number of 
clubs and bars, and raves take place 
in the hills surrounding the town, 
which are lots of fun to attend with 
a few friends. 

TRANSPOIJATION 

Zacatecas is on most major 
bus roures in northern Mexico 
between Chihuahua and south-
ern towns. T he bus from 
Chihuahua costs around $50 and 
takes roughly 12 hours. F rom 
the main bus station it is neces-
sary to take a local bus (20 cents) 
to the town. T here is also an air-
port, served by American and

Main pier: Tourists can visit Avalon Bay for a wide variety 0,1 activities, ranging 
from shopping to dining to recreational hiking and water sports. 

By LAURA CANTER 
Staff Writer 

T eying to find a place to spend spring break this year outside of San Diego? 
Santa Catalina is just waiting to be 
explored. Known to many as the 
"island of romance," Catalina . 
offers many diversions such as 
camping, diving, dining out, tours 
and shopping. T he island, approx-
imately 26 miles across the ocean 
from Long Beach, is accessible by 
boat and helicopter. 

Catalina is an idea I vacation 
spot because it offers something 
for everybody and endless possi-
bilities. For instance, the island 
provides snorkeling, scuba diving 
and ocean byaking for those who 
love water sports; hiking trails and 
mountain bilcing is also avai lable 
for those who love nature. 

In the town of Avalon, the most 
active tourist spot on the island, 
historic buildings are literally built 
into the foothi lls of the mountains, 
giving it an authentic, European 
look. As a whole, Catalina gives 
the impression of an exotic, far-
away place. It is a beautiful area to 

visit for a few days or just for the 
day.

Water sports keep things cool Zacatecas: 
Mountains 
surround 

colonial city 
Water sports are the best way to 

spend spring break because they com-
bat the hot weather and can be fun and 
entertaining for people with various 
skills and interest levels. Here is a sam-
ple of some of the water sports to enjoy 
over spring break, each of which are 
offered at Outback Adventures at 
UCSD. ' 

By VANESSA PENG 
Staff Writer 

U CSD is known for its close proximity to beau-tiful beach landscapes 
and the unbeatable beach view. 
However, UCSD students 
neglect to think about the col-
lege's great potential for water 
sports, This spring quarter is a 
good time to make use of this 
convenience. 

UYIIRIhG 
This activity is a good upper-

body workout, and can be 
learned through simple logistics. 

"If you have the right stroke, 
you r shoulders and triceps 
should be sore for a while, but 
beginners catch on quickly," 
John Muir College freshman 
Kimberly Chung said. "Plus you 
kill two birds with one stone; you 
work our and have fun." 

A kayaker (lot only receives a 
great upper-body workotlt, but is 
also given the opportunity to view 
wildlife from a unique perspec-
tive, 

"\Vhen you kayak you get an 
intimate relationship with ocean 
life; I've seen more wildlife and 
sea life - such as whales, birds 
and dolphins - than I have 
doing any other water sport," 
said Lindsay Hall, the wilderness 
orientation coordinator at 
Outback Adventures. 

Outback Adventures will offer 
kayak trips in San Diego Bay on 
April 20 from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m. 
for $30, $33 and $36 and one in 
Bahia de Los Angeles with Baja 
California from June 12 through 
June 19 for $415, $457 and $498, 
along with other kayaking trips. 

stUll biUIhG 
Scuba diving can make a huge 

impression on all those who try 
it. 

"It's a magical experience," 
said Denise Ouellette, the chal-
lenge course and climbing center 
director for Outback Adventures. 
"\Vhen I scuba dive I am in a state 
where I feel most graceful as I am 
encumbered by gravity. I feel like 
I am in space where there is no up 
or down." 

Good local spots are La 
Bufadora , the largest natural 
global in the world, and Catalina 
Island. 

Outback Adventures does not 
offer this activity, but interested 
readers can visit 
hup:llW1JJw,scubasa7ldiego.com. 

wHITE WRTER RlinlhG 
This water sport has been 

compared to a roller coaster ride, 
and is as fast-paced as it is excit-
ing. 

"Rafting is fantastic," said Tom 
Rottler, the director of outdoor 
recreation for Outback 
Adventures. "On the water rafting 
trips the atmosphere is great; raft 
guides are crazy and fun , I mean if 
it's a good day out you will have 
water wars with other rafts and 
paddle high fives, it's just a good 
time." 

White water rafting is an 
interesting experience because all 
those who try it are able to 
become a part of the water flow, 
Outback Adventures is offering a 
white water rafting trip in the 
Upper Kern River on May 13 
through May IS for $200, $205

a jewel in the arid northern moun-
tainous region of Mexico. 
Depending on the amount of time 
and money available, there are a 
few worthwhile side trips, but 
most require at least three days, 
One in particular is the Copper 
Canyon Railway, from Chihuahua 
through Creel to Los Mochis, on 
the Western coast. 

The journey passes through 
the bright red valleys of the 
canyon and past bright blue lakes 
and, toward the end, green fields 
and forests. 

It·s another six hours by bus to 
Guadalajara, called the most 
Mexican city in Mexico and the 
home of mariachi music. Closer 
by is the picturesque town of Real 
de Catorce, perhaps less frequent-
ed by travelers and quieter than 
Zacatecas, but truly srunning and 
possible to visit in a day. Access to 
the town is through former mine 
passages, which are worth experi-
encing themselves. 

All in all, Zacatecas is a fun 
place, lacking the cheesy tourism 
of more frequented spring break 
destinations, This means one can 
really get to know locals and feel 
part of a community rather than 
being part of a tourist class: We 
shared our dorm room with two 
bakers from around the corner -
and for a week's holiday, it doesn't 
get more authentic than that. 

You can party Mexican style, 
eat Mexican style (or Greek, of 
course) and, perhaps best of all, 
see a lot of pretty pink buildings. 

Tota I tu rn off. 

Please turn everything off 
when you leave the room. 

YOU make a difference.

HCtIUIfiES 
The island also provides a 

wonderful nightlife where the air 
is clean and crisp; during the

on an evening ride aboard an 
open-air tram, accompanied by 
nostalgic music and beautiful 
views to set the mood. Tickets for 
adults are $13 .50, Another tour 
that has the same price is the casi-
no tour, which is a guided tour 
through Catalina's famed land-
mark of Avalon. 

IIl1liSPORTIiTion

Island means traveling by boat or 
by aircraft. The Catalina Express 
leaves from Long Beach, San 
Pedro and Dana Point, Calif., and 
reaches Avalon in 55 minutes. 
The ferry costs $24.50 each direc-
tion for adults, For those who 

'" 

leave from Dana Point, all fares 
are a dollar more each way. The 
Catalina Passenger Service, also 
known as the Catalina Flyer, is 
more of a leisurely boat ride that 
takes an hour and IS minutes, It 
leaves from Newport Beach and 
arrives in Avalon as well. Adult 
round-trip tickets are $44, 

The Island Express Helicopter 
takes off from Long Beach and San 
Pedro and is a IS-minute flight 
that also lands in Avalon . The cost 
per person is $72 plus tax one way 
and $136 plus tax round-trip. On 
the island, shuttles, taxis and golf 
carts are available, 

I «nU((fI's lips 
The rustic village of Two 

Harbors, on the west end of the 
island, is popular for its camping, 
boating, snorkeling, scuba diving, 
ocean kayaking, hiking and 
mountain biking. Two Harbors 
provides classic adventure for 
those who love to rough it. Those 
who enjoy a nice dining experi-
ence should try the Harbor Reef 
Restaurant. It serves delicious 
food and costs around S 15 a meal. 

For those who love the 
nightlife, the restaurant provides a 
DJ or a live band while people 
enjoy dancing under the stars, For 
accommodations, consider the 
Banning House Lodge, priced at 
$179 per night midweek and $252 
for a two-night weekend, Two 
Harbors is accessible from Avalon 
by the Catalina Safari Shuttle Bus.

TGIO (Thank God It's Over) 
With Me First and the Gimmee 

Gimmees and the Mac Caddies 
8pm, Price Center Plaza 

Punk's premier cover artists, ME FIRST AND THE CIMME CIMMES 
are a conglomerate of some of the most recognjzable faces in new-
school punk. Drawn together by a mutual love of '60s and '70s music, 
the Gimme Gimmes work exclusively as a cover band. T heir repertoire 
include songs from such acts as Neil Diamond , Billy Joel, and John 
Denver. 
Singer Spike Slawson formed the Gimme Gimmes in 1995, drawing 

in the talents of NOFX bassist Fat Mike, Lagwagon singer Joey Cape, 
Foo Fighters guitarist Chris Shiflett, and Lagwagon drummer Dave 
Raun. Never originally intending to record, the band made appea r-
ances on punk compilation albums through much of the year. In 1996, 
however, the band began releas ing singles and produced their first full-
length effort, HAVE II BALL , in late 1997. Legend has it that last 
October's live RUIN lONNY'S BAR MITZVAH is based on th e fact that 
they really have (dru~kelnIYi played a Bar Mitzvah. T he MAC CADDIES 
also appear. Free to the public.

MONDAY. MARCH 7. 2005 

Basketball: Peters comes off 
the bench to lead Tritons 

continued from page ,6 points to lead San Francisco State 
to the conference win . Joe 
Robertson recorded his fifth dou-
ble-double of the season with 16 
points and a game-high 10 
rebounds.

ble digits. Instead, sophomore 
guard Robby Peters came off the 
bench to lead the team in scoring 
with nine points. Junior guard/for-
ward David Retzlaff also came off 
the bench for five boards to go 
along with his four points. Hatch 
had a solid game, with eight points 
and seven rebounds, and sopho-
more guard Mark Lewkowitz, after 
his game-winning buzzer-beater 
last weekend, had eight points and 
tied the team-high with two assists. 

On the UCSD side, it was 
another reserve player leading the 
way in scoring, as Peters put in 15 
points. Hatch added 12 points on 5-
of-8 shooting, while fellow fresh-
man guard Clint Allard chipped in 
with eight points and four 
rebounds. 

I . 

After a 61-58 victory over San 
Francisco State (14-12 overall, 1I-8 
CCAA) earlier in the season, the 
Tritons found themselves unable to 
duplicate that success on March 4 at 
the Swamp on the San Francisco 
campus. The Gators got out to an 
early 10-3 lead before UCSD 
responded with an 8-3 run of its 
own, cutting the deficit to 14-11. 
The Tritons, however, would never 
again find themselves as close as 
that three-point margin. The 
Gators, shooting a strong 54.2 per-
cent from the field in the first half, 
nearly doubled the Triton's 36.8-
percent first-half shooting, taking a 
33-21 lead into intermission. 

Overall, the Tritons were out-
worked on the glass, as San 
Francisco State won the rebound-
ing battle, 38-23 . The Gators also 
helped their efforts with nine steals 
and moved the ball around better 
with 18 total assists to the Tritons' 
12. The shooting percentages from 
the field were close, with UCSD 
making 45.7 percent and San 
Francisco State making 49.1 per-
cent of their shots. However, while 
the Gators converted 42.1 percent 
from three-point range and 75 per-
cent of their ' free-throws, the 
Tritons went 31.6 percent from 
long distance and a dismal 57.9 per-
cent from the charity stri pe. 

Even after the pair of road loss-
es, the season provided many bright 
spots for the Tritons. The team, los-
ing only one senior in guard Daniel 
Li u, has a strong nucleus of young 
and now experienced players. 

Under construction ... and onIinel Check out our new look 

The Tritons looked like they 
might be able to make another run 
in the second half, scoring the first 
four points after the break. While 
unable to sustain a huge run off of 
their start, UCSD played hard, 
deterring the Cators from extend-
ing their lead. With 1I :53 left to 
play in the game. a three-pointer by 
Retzlaff pulled the team to within 
eight points. However, San 
Francisco State went on a strong 
13-2 run over the next five minutes 
and pushed the game out of reach. 

In head coach Bill Carr's inau-
gural season at UCSD, the Tritons 
recorded II wins, setting a new 
high for UCSD since moving to 
Division II and surpassing the old 
mark of nine, set in 2003-04.

MONDAY. MARCH 7. 2005 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

T~nni5: Deep lineup proves crucial to success 
continued from page ,6 

Bronowicki said. "Especially since 
we have had to deal with injuries, 
it's taking a while for people to get 
off the ground." 

T he Tritons enjoyed early suc-
cess in doubles play and, for the 
fourth Straight match, swept all 
three doubles rnatchups to take an 
early 3-0 lead entering singles 
play. 

Reeling off six straight wins, 
No. I tandem junior Tara 
Siddiqui and sophomore Marsha 
Malinow came back from a 2-5 
deficit to win, 8-5. No. 2 
Bronowicki and Katie McKee 
won, 8-3, and senior Jasmin Dao, 
in her first action after returning 
from an anlde injury, teamed up 
with junior Marissa Hilker to take 
the No. 3 matchup at 8-1. 

In singles play, the Tritons 
continued their dominance. 
Malinow avenged her previous 
loss to the Seawolves' Brianna 
Bailey in straight sets, 6-4, 6-3, at 
the top spot on the ladder to set 
the tone, and the rest of the 
Tritons followed suit. Hilker took 
down Sonoma State's Gina 
Dunch in the No.2 singles match, 
7-5, 3-6, 10-6, in the only three-
set match of the day. 

Dao (6-2, 6-1), Siddiqui (6-2, 
6-2), junior Leigh Roberts (6-2 , 
6-1) and McKee (6-2, 6-1) all 
eased past thei r opponen ts in 
straight sets as well. 

On March 4, a much-antici-
pated match between the Tritons 
and the San Jose State Spartans 
was canceled due to rain in San 
Jose, Calif. T h is was to be 
UCSD's second match of the sea-
son against a Division I opponent. 
(The Tritons squeaked by UC 
Davis earlier this season, 5-4, at 
home.) Since the Tritons have 
already had three matches rained 
out this season - all of which 

were against league opponents 
and must be made up - the 
match against the Spartans will 
not be rescheduled. 

"We were disappointed [about 
the match being canceled] 
because we wanted to see how far 
we could go," Bronowicki said. 
"We are beating who we should, 
but it's nice to get competitive 
matches. We have some tough 
teams coming up in the next cou-
ple of weelcs." 

The weather was cooperative 
on March 2, as UCSD hosted 
conference rival Cal Poly Pomona 

" We stiU have a while until 
we peak. Especially since 
we have had to deal with 
injuries, it's taking a while 
far people to get off the 

ground. " 
- Kristin Bronowidd. sophomore, 

UCSD women's tennis 

at the Northview Courts. 
Doubles play gave the Tritons a 
large boost off the bat, taking all 
three matches to give them an 
early 3-0 lead. Siddiqui and 
Malinow finished with an impres-
sive 8-5 upset over Broncos' 
junior Dehlia Feliz and sopho-
more Katrina Holmberg, the No. 
6 doubles squad in the country. 
UCSD's other two doubles squads 
also won by super set scores of 8-
5, with Bronowicki and McKee 
winning at the No. 2 spot and 
Hilker and Roberts winning at the 
No. 3 spot. 

Singles play featured more of 
the same, with the Tritons win-
ning five of the six spots to clinch 
the match victory, 8-1. 

The No. I matchup pitted 
nationally ranked players 
Malinow and Feliz against one 
another. Malinow, currently 
ranked No. 44 in the nation, took 
the first set from No. 19 Feliz, 7-
5, but could not hang on long, 
dropping the second set, 7-5, and 
falling, 10-3, in the third-set, a 
super tiebreaker. Nonetheless, 
UCSD players posted victories at 
every other spot on the ladder to 
clinch the victory. 

In addi tion to doubles play, the 
bottom of the singles ladder has 
been a strong source of success for 
the Tri tons this season. In fact, 
UCSD players at the No. 4, 5 and 
6 Spots have not lost matches all 
season, and are a combined 21-0. 

"The strength of the team has 
always been depth, " LaPlante 
said . "While we I don't have the 
powerhouse players that some of 
these other schools have at No. I 
and No.2, our top eight players 
are really close in ability, so we 
have highly skilled players provid-
ing solid, consistent play all the 
way down the ladder." 

Up next for the Tri tons is a test 
in stamina, with three matches 
scheduled for three consecutive 
days. All will be played at home, 
first against the University of San 
Francisco on March 10, Cal State 
San Bernardino on March II and 
Cal State Bakersfield on March 
12 . 

The matchup against the 
University of San Francisco gives 
the Tritons another chance to test 
themselves against a Division [ 
program. Cal State San 
Bernardino and Cal State 
Bakersfield are conference oppo-
nents.

Baseball splits two 
with Cal State ' L.A. 
Navarro picks up first win, 

pitching six scoreless innings 
By COURTNEY FIELD 

Senior Staff Writer 
Once again, rain proved to be a 

third-party factor in the opening 
game between o. 19 UCS D and 
league rival Ca l State Los Angeles 
on March 4. The inclement 
weather forced the teams to post-
pone the remainder of the game 
after the Tritons were ahead, 7-0, 
through ix innings. T he game 
continued March 5 with a 7-3 
Triton victory over the Golden 
Eagles. 

Beca use of the postponement, 
the originally chedu led double-
header between the teams turned 
into a ingle second game in which 
Cal tate Los Angeles (5-5 overall, 
4-5 California Collegiate Athletic 
Association) edged UCSD (8-3 
overa ll , 4-2 CCAA), 8-6, for the 
win. Game three was played on 
March 6 but results were unavai l-
able at press time. 

In the opener, Triton junior 
outfielder Matt Lawson nearly hit 
for the cycle with a homerun, a 
double and a single. 

UCS D scored early and often, 
fending off an attempted come-
back late in the game from the 
Golden Eagles. Lawson, currently 
hitting .289, kicked off the Triton 
onslaught with a solo homerun in 
the bottom of the first inning. T he 
blast initiated the UCSD scoring 

throughout the game. 
Senior left fielder Joel Clark, 

senior third baseman Alex Gascon 
and fteshman first baseman C hris 
Hom notched two hits apiece, 
contributing to the Triton victory. 

Starting on the hill for UCSD, 
junior Jose avarro (1-0) pitched 
six coreless innings, striking out 
seven en route to picking up his 
first win of the season. When the 
game tarred to warm up in the top 
of the seventh inning on March 5, 
the Tritons used three relief pitch-
ers to close out the win. 

Freshman reli ever Hunter 
wanson (0-0) came on in the sev-

enth inning, fo llowed by junior 
Evan McDonald (0-0) and senior 
Ryan Leake (2- 1) to close out the 
ninth. The powerful combination 
on the mound put any notion of a 
Cal State Los Angeles raUy to rest 
as the Golden Eagles hit into a 
game-ending double play. 

The Golden Eagles took the 
second game of the series on 
March 5, edging UCSD 8-6. The 
Golden E agles scored six runs and 
jumped out to an 8-1 lead in the 
fifth inning, then held out to 
defeat the Tritons. UCSD was 
unable to rebOund despite a valiant 
effort over the ensuing four and a 
half innings of play.

No.9 UCSD renlains perfect 
Women's tennis beats Sonoma State 

By EVAN WANG 
Senor Staff Writer 

For the third time in four 
weeks, unfavorable weather has 
caused a disruption in the UCSD 
women 's tennis schedule. 
Nonetheless, the ninth -ranked 
Tritons took care of business once 
again, shrugging aside their fourth 
rained-out match of the season to 
post two more victories onto their 
record, which now stands at 7-0. 
No team in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association has 
won more than a single frame 
against the perfect 4-0 UCSD. 

The Triton women traveled to 
Rohnert Park, Calif.; on March 5 
for their second match of the sea-
son against Sonoma State. The 
Tritons took the first match, 8-1, 
on Feb. 25 at home. The change in 
venue did nothing to spare the fate 
of the outmatched Sea wolves, who 
were blanketed by the UCSD 
women, 9-0. 

"This wa the first match all 
season that we've actually been 
able to have our full lineup play-
ing," said head coach Liz 
LaPlante, who has had to deal with 
injuries on the team all season 
long. "We're still not at 100 per-
cent, but hopefully we'll heal up 
during finals week." 

The team has a long schedule 
ahead that will allow athletes time 
to recuperate ftom their injuries.

Carr lead.s {JCSD to best D-II finish yet 

Men's crew opens 
season with two wins 

By JOE TEVELOWITZ 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD men's basketball 
team ended its season on a sour 
note after dropping its final two 

galllt:~ on the road. A 74-59 loss to 
San Francisco State on March 4 at 
the Swamp was followed by a sea-
son-ending 67-52 loss to Sonoma 

tate on March 5. T he Tritons end 
the season at 11 - 16 overall and 7-
13 in California Collegiate 
Ath letic Association conference 
play. 

The March 5 game between 
Sonoma State (16- 11 overall, 13-7 
CCAA) and UCSD was the regu-
lar season finale for both teams. 
The Seawolves came out with the 
knowledge that there was a lot at 
stake, as a victory would be anoth-
er stepping stone to a pos ible 

CM regional bid . After the 
Tritons cored six points in the 
opening three minutes of the 
game, Sonoma State held the team 
to only four over tile next six and a 
half minutes, while building up an 
II-point lead. UCSD pulled to 
within six before the Seawolves 
pushed their lead back to 12 after a 
buzzer-beating three-pointer by 
Ryan Ilcnsel that made him 
Sonoma State's career leader in 
three-point field goals made. 

Sonoma tate came out in the 
~econd half and wa able to extend 
Its lead from there, taking a 21-
oint advantage less than five min-

li tes into the half after I rensel's 
second three-pointer of the game, 
and the final of his career. The 
Tritons were determined not to 
fa ll in their final game of the s :a-
on without a fight. The tough-

Tritons start fresh with wins over 
Irvine, Cal State Long Beach

The UCSD men's crew team 
opened its season ~t 2-0 for the 
third year in a row with landslide 
victories over UC Irvine on Feb. 26 
and Cal State Long Beach on 
March 5 at Tecolote Shores in 
Mission Bay, but this is a very dif-
ferent UCSD team than the league 
has seen in the past. 

"We are definitely a lot larger 
than the guys of previous years," 
varsity team captain Steve Oliver 
said. 

UC Irvine was the first school 
to compete against the larger and 
tronger Triton team. UCSD 

placed first in four of the five races, 
and the varsity men's eight boat fin-
ished six second ahead of Irvine. 

"The victory was a great way to 
start off the season, and we are 
goi ng to keep on improving," vat:Si-
ty coach Mark Davis sa id. 

The varsity team is not the only 
team that has come a long way 
ince the beginning of training. Al l 

players have participated in exten-
sive preseason workouts that 
included both short- and long-dis-
tance races. Short-di tance races 
range from three t6 five minutes, 
while the longer race are about 60 
to 90 minutes long. 

T he junior varsity and novice 
teams showed they were ready for 
the cnallenge against Irvine. The 
men's junior varsity eight boat fin-

ished ahead ofUC Irvine by 12 sec-
onds. UCSD finished at 6 minutes, 
24.9 seconds, and UC Irvine 
cruised in soon after at 6:36.9. 

"We have a great group of guys 
on the]Y," Davis said. "They are 
very strong rowers." 

The domination over the 
Anteaters continued in the novice 
eight race as UCSD cruised to a 
victory, finishing at 6:30.5. UC 
Irvine followed behind at 6:41.6. 

"It is always great to beat 
Irvine," Davis said. "They are 
always quick li t the beginning of 
the year." 

The novice victory was the first 
for many member of the team. 

"Mo t of the rowers are com-
peting for their first time, and they 
are just a bunch of walk-on ath -
letes," novice team captain Joe 
Gram said. 

Cal State Long Beach suffered 
the same fate as UC Irvine on 
March 5, as UCSD took first in aLi 
three race. In the varsity four, 
UCSD fmis hed slightly ahead, 
crossing the fini h line at 7:09.08. 
T he 4gers clocked in at 7:17.2. 

"Everyone pulled their weight," 
Oliver aid. "If everybody contin-
ues to do their job, we will have sat-
isfactory resul ts." 

The men ' varsity eight also 
placed first, with a time of 6:38.0. 
The race did not start out mooth-
