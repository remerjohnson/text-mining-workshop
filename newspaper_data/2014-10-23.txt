UNIVERSITY CENTERS

Judge Rules Against Che Cafe

The Che Cafe’s unlawful detainer trial concluded Tuesday with a San Diego County Superior Court judge ruling in the 
Board of Regents’ favor. The collective will have 
five days to vacate the space after the university 
delivers a written notice of the verdict.

During the bench trial proceedings, Judge 
Katherine A. Bacal determined that the university 
proved its ownership of the building and provided 
the collective with adequate notice of  eviction. 
The judge further found that the Che had not 
sought a dispute resolution as specified in the 
Master Space Agreement and thus the court 
proceedings were valid.

The Regents claimed that it was the Che 
Cafe’s responsibility to extend its tenancy and 

seek certification from the Graduate Student 
Association, but had failed to do either in the last 
several years. However, lawyers for the Regents 
also argued that the university, as the owner of 
the property, legally had a right to terminate the 
Che’s month-to-month lease without providing a 
reason.

The collective’s defense centered on proving 
the university had not followed the appropriate 
procedures set forth by the Master Space 
Agreement when it evicted the Che.

The Che Cafe’s attorney, Bryan Pease, said 
that the small percentage of the GSA members 
who voted to decertify the collective earlier this 
year did not sufficiently speak for the students on 
campus.

A San Diego State freshman died 
on Friday, Oct. 17 from an apparent 
meningitis infection.

Sara Stelzer, 18, was a member 
of the Kappa Delta sorority at 
SDSU and had attended several 
Greek parties earlier this month, 
prompting officials at the university 
to reach out to those who may 
have been in contact with Stelzer so 
that they may receive preventative 
medication for the illness. 

Campus admnistrators sent 
out a notification to all members 
of Kappa Delta sand those who 
attended parties hosted by the SDSU 
chapters of Alpha Epsilon Pi and 
Delta Sigma Phi that occurred on 
Wednesday, Oct. 8 and Thursday, 
Oct. 9, respectively. 

Once Stelzer’s death was 
confirmed, members of the SDSU 
Kappa Delta sorority sent their 
condolences on their Facebook page 

on Oct. 17.
“Today we mourn the loss of 

our beloved sister Sara,” the chapter 
said. “Sara was a beautiful woman 
inside and out and we are honored 
to call her a Kappa Delta. She is 
greatly missed. During this time, 
please keep Sara’s family in your 
thoughts and prayers.”

Members of the SDSU Alpha 
Epsilon Pi also posted a statement 
on Facebook in which they sent 
their condolences and explained 
that they are “working to ensure 
that all available measures are being 
taken to provide for the health of 
[their] members and [their] campus 
community.”

UCSD students also received an 
email on Saturday, Oct. 18 about 
the incident and were advised to 
seek help immediately from an 
emergency medical facility if they 
believed they had the disease. 

According to the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, 
meningitis, or meningococcal 
disease, is a severe bacterial 

infection of the blood and brain 
which, if left untreated, can lead 
to brain damage, loss of limbs or 
death. Symptoms include flu-like 
reactions such as high fever, severe 
headache, stiff neck, rash, nausea 
and vomiting. Symptoms typically 
become visible within three to seven 
days after exposure.

The bacteria spread through an 
exchange of respiratory or throat 
secretions. This can occur when 
individuals have close contact 
with one another through sharing 
drinks, toothbrushes, cigarettes, 
unwashed utensils and lip balm or 
any other direct oral contact like 
kissing. Teens and young adults 
most commonly receive it, and 
particularly college students living 
in dorms since they live in small 
spaces and are constantly in close 
contact with one another.

UCSD to 
Open Food 
Pantry Next 
Quarter

A.S. COUNCIL

The announcement comes 
after a campuswide survey 
shows 35 percent of students 
may be skipping meals.

BY  jacky  to 
staff Writer

UCSD administrators announced 
earlier this month that the university 
is creating a food pantry at the Old 
Student Center that will provide 
nonperishable, free food to all UCSD 
students on Oct. 2. Construction is 
expected to begin in early fall this 
year, enabling the food pantry to 
open by Winter Quarter 2015. 

A.S. President Robby Boparai told 
the UCSD Guardian that the pantry 
will be open at least three days a week 
at varying hours each day in order to 
serve as many students as possible. 
The pantry will offer a variety of 
nonperishable foods such as canned 
goods and pasta. 

After seeing the results of a 
recent survey, which indicated that 
35 percent of UCSD students were 
skipping meals “somewhat often” and 
“often,”   a group of UCSD entities 
collaborated with administrators to 
formulate the idea of the food pantry. 
Some of the key parties involved 
include then-interim Vice Chancellor 
of Student Affairs Alan Houston, 
Muir Dean of Student Affairs Patty 
Mahaffey, the Financial Aid office 
and A.S. Council.

“As cost of living and college 
expenses increase, some students 
are faced with difficult decisions 
as to how their money will be 
allocated,” interim University 
Centers Director Sharon Van 
Bruggen said. “Establishing a food 
pantry on campus will provide 
needed relief to students who may 
not have nutritious and varied food 
options on a daily basis.”

Although the food pantry will be 
open to all students, A.S. Council 
has been charged with making 
sure that the service is meeting its 
target community. It will also trust 
students to take only as much as 
they need. 

In terms of funding, the VCSA 
office originally provided $50,000 
to the A.S. Council for initial 
construction costs, while the A.S. 
Council itself will cover the costs 
of employment and supplies of the 
food pantry for the duration of this 
school year. Despite its tight budget, 
the A.S. Council feels that solving 
student hunger is a priority.

“It’s not about saving money any 
more. This is about providing a 
resource,” Boparai said. 

Boparai also said that the  
Council hopes that some of its 
campus partners will volunteer to 
join it and take on some of the 
expenses, either temporarily or 
permanently.

The A.S. Council expects to 
hire two student employees who

A.S. COUNCIL 

A.S. Council to Launch First-Ever Sophomore Class Council 

A.S. Council passed bylaws for 
a new Sophomore Class Council at 
its meeting on Wednesday, Oct. 15. 
The bylaws allow for the creation 
of a sophomore class council 
pilot program under the Office of 
College Affairs. The mission of the 
council, according to the language 
of the bylaws, is to represent “all 
sophomore students in an effort 
to generate a sense of a unified 
identity and amplify voices of the 
sophomore class.”

Former AVP College Affairs 
Meena Kaushik originally presented 
the idea for class councils to A.S. 
Council last year. Current AVP 
College Affairs Travis Miller took 
over the project with the previous 
First Year Council when he assumed 
office. He is currently working on 
creating the new council with about 

half of the members of last year’s 
First Year Council.

“We have a good amount of 
interest to fill an executive structure, 
but will be recruiting,” Miller said. 
“We’re completely, 100 percent in 
building mode. We’re probably five or 
six weeks behind where we needed to 
be, but I have a good and committed 
staff that’s very much on top of it.”

Duties and responsibilities of 
the sophomore council, as outlined 
in the bylaws, are to “provide 
programming and resources,” 
to “meet weekly,” and “provide 
guidance and information to 
students” of the sophomore class.

The need for a Sophomore Class 
Council became very apparent to 
Miller during the beginning of 
Fall Quarter 2014, when many 
sophomores asked him how they 
can get involved as second-year 
students. 

“When the language was 
first proposed, there was a lot of 

uncertainty of the need for the 
council,” Miller said. “People didn’t 
want a tenth voting government, 
but this is not necessarily a voting 
body. We asked people what they 
struggled with as sophomores and 
what were their needs, and I think 
people realized it’s viable.”

Another issue was how the 
council will be funded; according to 
Miller, the council is looking into an 
innovation fund grant from the Vice 
Chancellor of Student Affairs and is 
hoping that they will not have to use 
A.S. funding. 

Miller also said that the 
Sophomore Class Council and A.S. 
Council will probably reassess the 
language of the bylaws in a few 
quarters to identify what worked 
and what did not. Because the 
council is a pilot program, it will be 
reassessed before Miller terms out 
of A.S. Council.

“There’s more pressure on our 
end to do well because we could end 

up on the chopping block,” Miller 
said. “But our hope is that this will 
turn into a Junior Class Council and 
eventually could matriculate into a 
Senior Class Council and that we 
could have all four councils staffed 
and ready to go. If this works then 
hopefully we can pilot a new Junior 
Class Council in two quarters.”

Miller hopes to have the new 
body set by Week 7 or Week 8 
of this quarter, and then plans to 
begin work on a career fair with the 
Career Services Center, internships 
and graduate schools, tailored 
specifically towards second-year 
students.

“My entire office is excited; 
it’s more work, but it’s work that 
we enjoy,” Miller said. “I’m very 
optimistic that this will be successful 
and that we’ll be able to have junior 
and senior councils as well.”

will manage both the pantry and 
a group of volunteers. In addition 
to helping sustain the pantry, it 
sees this as a strong opportunity for 
those interested in being a part of 
the A.S. Council in the future.

In order to better gauge the 

needs of the student body, the A.S. 
Council will conduct anonymous 
surveys of those who visit the food 
pantry. It hopes that this will help 
identify the root cause of student 
hunger and consequently increase 
its chances of solving it in the long 
run.

“We want the food pantry to be 

a short-term fix for individuals who 
are experiencing food insecurity,” 
Boporai said. “But also to become 
a long-term fix for the campus as 
a whole by continuing to serve as a 
safety net for these individuals.”

“If the judge in this trial 
determines that the GSA vote was 
necessary for the eviction to proceed, 
then we should [...] take everything 
on submission to have a full hearing 
on our challenge to the GSA vote 
not being supported by substantial 

evidence and done in a manner that’s 
in accordance to the law,” Pease said 
at the beginning of the trial last week. 

Bacal found that the decertification 
question was ultimately irrelevant to 
the ruling.

The Che Cafe had planned to be 
back in court on Oct. 31 to challenge 
the GSA’s decertification. But given 

Bacal’s ruling, the proceeding may 
be moot. 

The collective is planning to host 
a Save the Che Rally on Oct. 28 to 
demonstrate against the university’s 
actions.

UCSD Medical Services Head Says Meningitis Strain is Rare

Barbara and Princeton University 
exacerbated fears over the spread of 
the disease.

Director of Medical Services at 
UCSD Stacie San Miguel explained 
in an interview with the UCSD 
Guardian that the disease is 
extremely rare, totaling an average 
of 500 cases in the United States in 
the past year.

“When something like this 
happens, it can be devastating,” 

Miguel said. “Ten percent of people 
carry the bacteria in their body but 
don’t get sick. We don’t know why 
some people have severe [reaction 
to meningitis] and why others don’t 
have [a] problem with it.” 

Miguel also explained that if an 
individual who was vaccinated for 
meningitis came in close respiratory 
contact with an individual who was 
not vaccinated, that person would 
not receive the disease. The vaccine 
does not contain the active bacteria 
but rather inactive parts of it, which 

allows the body to become immune 
to that certain strain of meningitis. 

While incoming UCSD students are 
currently not required to be vaccinated 
for meningococcal disease, a general 
tuberculosis screening is mandatory. 

President of SDSU Kappa Delta 
Kaitlyn Holt and President of SDSU 
Alpha Epsilon Pi Nick Grossberg were 
unable to be reached by press time for 
comment.

How to Fail 
All Your 
Midterms,
Guaranteed 

Midterms are those pesky, midquarter assessments that seem to drive all of 
your peers needlessly crazy. From a 
legal perspective, midterms are only 
valid if they take place during the 
explicit midpoint of each quarter in 
the academic calendar — which is, 
of course, Wednesday of Week 5 at 
exactly 12 p.m. As very few exams are 
actually scheduled for this “midterm” 
period, it stands to reason that all 
other nonfinal exams are unconstitu-
tional. Thus, students have an obliga-
tion to protest these exams by doing 
as poorly as possible.

Failing midterms is actually a 
complicated art, what with all the in-
class instruction, subliminal learning 
and forced retention i.e. homework. 
It may be easy to fall into the bad 
habit of putting the right answer on 
exam questions, so the real test is 
doing everything but. Since deliberate 
failure is frowned upon, you’ll need 
to pretend that you’re actually doing 
your best

John Wooden famously main-
tained that “failure to prepare is pre-
paring to fail.” With failure as the goal, 
success is in the act of failing. Thus, 
proper preparation for exam day is 
critical to failing all your midterms.

As the course continues, make 
sure your attention is directed at any-
thing but lesson materials. The course 
syllabus is useful to understand what 
material should be ignored during 
each week throughout the quarter.

Pulling an all-nighter before 
your midterm may still be neces-
sary. Watching multiple seasons of 
Real Housewives of Wherever and 
reruns of Khloe and Kourtney Take 
Whatever for hours the night before 
an exam is a good way to make sure 
you get no learning done by accident.

Focusing during a test may acci-
dentally yield a higher score, so get 
your grub on before each midterm. 
Pre-exam meals should be designed to 
give you enough stomach problems to 
be unable to completely focus on your 
exam. Make sure you eat approxi-
mately 5,000 calories of Bombay 
Coast meals in Price Center to guar-
antee enough indigestion to last the 
length of an exam.

Students with scantron exams 
have an easy way to fake an effort 
on midterms. Simply fill in multiple 
bubbles on each line on the answer 
sheet. This way, you will appear to be 
putting the right answer sometimes 
while you also make sure that correct 
responses will be voided by the mul-
tiple answers. 

Essays will be a little more chal-
lenging to fake. Many professors and 
teaching assistants will give partial 
credit for effort, but too much partial 
credit could accidentally yield a pass-
ing grade. To avoid partial credit, use 
the essay space in your blue book to 
fully challenge the professor’s power 
and natural right to include the 
prompt on the exam (note: This may 
backfire on a philosophy exam).

When all else fails, you can try 
to blatantly copy answers from your 
neighbor. Exacerbate your proctor’s 
suspicion by loudly proclaiming to 
your neighbor, “I can’t copy your 
answers if you keep covering your 
blue book.” The following trip to the 
academic integrity office and meet-
ing with deans should be enough to

Pave the Way for More Parking 

Transportation and Parking Services tackled one aspect of  the campus commuter problem when they 
maintained bus accessibility. Now it’s time for them to address the biggest issue: parking. 

ILLUSTRATION BY ELYSE YANG

This month’s launch of the new U-Pass sticker marks the end of an era of prolonged turmoil for campus commuters. With unrestricted access to all San Diego Metropolitan Transit 
System buses and trolleys, UCSD students dependent on public 
transportation are, at least for the moment, better off than when 
UCSD Transportation Services threatened immediate fee hikes and 
budget cuts in January 2013.

With one major commuter issue resolved, it’s time for our 
campus transit administrators to begin working on tackling the 
other daunting demon for commuters: student parking.

In recent years, UCSD has not been subtle about trying to deter 
students, particularly residents, from bringing cars to campus. 
“As part of our sustainable efforts in this new community, we are 
encouraging residents NOT to bring a car,” the university’s webpage 
for prospective residents in the Village reads.

The university’s pro-environment stance against cars on campus 
is admirable, yet recent policies inhibit student’s abilities to park on 
campus. These policies seem to ignore the reality that many students 
rely heavily on efficient parking to be on time for class, participate in 
clubs or even make it to shifts at on-campus jobs.

TPS emerged from last spring’s transportation referendum as 
one of the big winners. As per the terms of U-Pass, TPS is no longer 
required to use its heavily depleted funds to subsidize a free bus 
zone. TPS revenue, comprised primarily of parking permit sales and 
parking violation fees, will no longer be stretched to cover the costs 
of busing students to campus on city-run transit.

Not having to pay for MTS bus rides benefits TPS two-fold: The 
department can begin to pay off the millions-of-dollars-deep hole of 
debt incurred from rampant spending and mismanagement and can 
even look to expand services. The latter will be critical to a student 
body that seems to constantly drive more cars to campus, only to 
find fewer spots available. A report released last March showed that 
there were over 34,000 weekly motor-vehicle commuters that drove 
onto campus but that there are fewer than 18,000 total parking spots. 

The past several years have seen a plethora of parking spot 
markings with green and red paint splashed over the coveted yellow 
paint of student-reserved spaces. Over 133 “S” spots were lost in 
2011 alone, and dozens disappeared in the following years.

Meanwhile, faculty, staff and visitor parking too have 
experienced visible expansion on campus — at the expense of

Cafe Ventanas’ Waffle Theme is Not a Hit

In the discussion of institutional overreach and dictatorial con-duct on campus, there is per-
haps no greater example than the 
Great Waffle Crisis of 2014 that 
Cafe Ventanas diners and the other 
unfortunate residents of Eleanor 
Roosevelt College now face.

Perhaps inspired by too many epi-
sodes of “Will It Waffle?” the Housing, 
Dining and Hospitality department  
(HDH) decided that stripping stu-
dents of their right to grilled food was 
the ideal course of action. The ERC 
mission is to propagate multicultural 
values and worldviews but combining 
ethnic foods that took millennia to 
develop with a basic American break-
fast staple is not the best way to go 
about it.

Nothing brings the tuition-laden 
student body together like food does. 
Efforts to put an end to the waffle 
theme have been started, with students 
turning to physical protest and social 
media campaigns as their dissent tac-
tics of choice. 

The waffles at Cafe V have actu-
ally cooked up a conversation among 
students regarding who decides what 
students eat. Waffles have hardly any 

nutritional value and offering them 
to students as a primary meal option 
does not exactly promote a sustainable, 
healthy lifestyle. 

Students clearly should have a 
say in the dining hall menus. No one 
expects a five-star quality meal from 
the average dining hall but the least 
HDH could do is ask students what 
they want to eat — even if that means 
having to reverse a menu decision. 

We applaud HDH’s efforts to try 
something new, but changing an entire 
dining hall to a theme centered around 
an unhealthy breakfast staple is not 
the way to go. They should have more 
variety, especially for students who 
might have dietary restrictions, or just 
don’t want to eat the same carb-filled 
meal for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 

HDH, to its credit, probably does 
not want this unhappiness among stu-
dents to become a bigger issue than it 
is already. In the past, they have been 
receptive to student opinions about 
decisions regarding dining halls. For 
example, when Oceanview Terrace was 
switched to an all you can eat style 
during the 2012-2013 school year, stu-
dents protested, and after a couple 
quarters HDH reverted back to the 

original a la carte menu for Fall 2013. 
If they fail to change the menu at Café 
Ventanas, unhappy students will likely 
overflow to other dining halls or may 
opt out of residential living at the next 
opportunity, which will only end up 
harming HDH’s bottom line. 

HDH has made many hit or miss 
changes in the past, and this one is 
unfortunately a huge miss. They will 
do well to listen to the student voice 
of protest, and revert back to the old 
menu at Café Ventanas, or risk alienat-
ing a large chunk of their clientele.

student parking. This trend is not 
only unfair to students but is not 
representative of a university that 
claims to be taking real steps toward 
improving accessibility.

TPS, as a result, needs to be 
proactive about expanding parking 
options for all UCSD affiliates, 
current and prospective. The 
addition of one or more new parking 
structures is the most obvious 
solution to the rapidly depleting 
supply of places to park on campus. 
Large, uncovered lots, such as 
those between Muir and Thurgood 
Marshall Colleges, would be prime 
locations for new, multi-story 
garages that could benefit university 
staff, commuter students and 
residents alike.

Additionally, a common complaint 
about residents hogging spots that 

could be better served for daily 
commuters can easily be resolved 
through introduction of “R” spots. 
Resident-specific permits could be 
issued, perhaps even at a higher cost, 
to students who live on campus and 
could help eliminate competition 
for parking between residents and 
commuters. These spaces could 
be strategically introduced near 
residence halls and apartments for full 
effectiveness.

for such changes, TPS could opt to 
end discounted and free night and 
weekend parking. Such is the case 
at other universities and may be 
necessary to keep TPS afloat without 
passing along the costs to monthly 
and annual permit holders.

Even if TPS doesn’t act to increase 
parking options immediately, 
other campus developments will 
require strong innovation from 

the department in the near future. 
The planned 2019 arrival of several 
elevated rail stations on campus, as 
part of the MTS transit expansion 
project, could mean more “park-and-
ride” commuters and fewer available 
spaces. As UCSD looks to become 
better connected with the greater San 
Diego area, more parking amenities 
will be needed to accommodate 
higher demand.

TPS has an opportunity, as 
well as a responsibility, to do its 
part to ensure that UCSD remains 
accessible. The recent opening of the 
Gilman Transit Center demonstrates 
that the university can be skilled 
at identifying and resolving issues 
through campus transportation 
development. This is the same sort 
of progressive thinking UCSD needs 
to employ to ensure commuters can 
make it to campus in the immediate 
future and beyond.

The RoyalePLAY   REVIEW

BY  christian   gella  staff WRITER

Inspired staging and knockout performances bring to life the story of heavyweight champion Jay 
Jackson in a play that tackles the turbulant history of African-Americans in boxing.

A play about boxing without actual boxing seems 
paradoxical, but if it’s a 
production at the Old 
Globe with a talented 
ensemble, director and 
playwright to boot, then 
somehow a play about 
boxing without actual 
boxing appears ingenious. 
Tracing back to America’s 
roots in African-
American civil rights 
struggles, “The Royale” 
— directed by Obie Award 
winner Rachel Chavkin 
and writer Marco Ramirez 
(best known for “Orange is 
the New Black”) — explores 
the complicated politics of 
sports as it intertwines with 
racial tensions of the early 
20th century. 

Inspired by the story 
of Jack Johnson, the 
first African-American 
heavyweight champion, 
Jay Jackson (Robert 
Christopher Riley) realizes 
that the segregated world 
of boxing could endanger 
more than just his own 
safety

Let’s start with the 
obvious: How does a 
boxing match without 
the thrust of fists seem 
plausible? Through precise 
timing and choreography 
of punches through the 
air (but not physically 
making contact), along 

with a wide range 
of staging effects, 
synchronized claps by the 
cast members, the ring of 
the bell and taut lighting 
over an arena format. 
Distinct and noticeable at 
first, this style of the play 
becomes firsthand and 
natural to the audience as 
the play goes on simply 
because the emotional 
punch between each 
action becomes more 
heavy and powerful. 

Combined with 
a minimalistic set — 
including a wooden 
boxing ring, a bell and 
a chair — the cast really 
made use of a simple 
design to heighten the 
chaotic world of the 
characters.

Each punch becomes 
significant when the 
audience realizes how 
much is at stake for 
Jackson. The extensive 
range of emotions Riley 
has to master for this 
show is incredibly vast; 
his character is plunged 
through a journey that 
initially starts as a thirst 
for fame that becomes 
a complex issue of race. 
At the start of the play, 
Jackson taunts Fish 
(Okieriete Onaodowan), 
an African-American 
heavyweight boxer with 
potential, because Fish is

"I  forget  where  we  were" 
by ben  howard
Release Date Oct. 21

Singer-songwriter beats the sophomore slump with an im-
pressive blend of unique guitar picking and somber nostalgia. 

ALBUM  REVIEW

It would be an impressive feat to hold the attention of an audience addicted to instant entertainment for more than 
five minutes, and it’s certainly not a feat 
Ben Howard achieves. With a collection of 
songs that mostly exceed this time frame, the 
English singer-songwriter’s sophomore album 
“I Forget Where We Were” is, well, boring. 
But that isn’t to say boring doesn’t work in his 
favor. No, Howard 
has mastered the art 
of dreary and he’s 
been using it to lure 
listeners into his 
darkly self-reflective 
narratives ever since 
the 2011 release of 
his highly-acclaimed 
debut album “Every 
Kingdom.”

Surely the quiet 
surfer boy behind 
“Every Kingdom” — 
a collection of folksy 
tunes that ponders 
everything from 
self-empowerment to sweet nostalgia — has 
matured with his sophomore album. “I Forget 
Where We Were” has a much larger sound, a 
sound that echoes through empty rooms and 
contributes to a sweet, melancholy feeling that 
acts as a cohesive force throughout the album. 
That isn’t to say “I Forget Where We Were” 
will alienate fans of the delicate folk-pop 
tunes of Howard’s debut. With lyrics more like 
unfinished thoughts and reverberating electric 
guitars, his dark second album maintains 
the intimacy and nostalgic undertones that 
elevated him into stardom.

Howard’s husky vocals and soft drum-
beats have a soothing effect, lulling you into a 
kind of trance that is no doubt the result of a 
satisfying reverberation that sets in mid-song. 
But Howard is aware that the most memorable 
stories are unpredictable. Just as intricate gui-
tar picking and soft drums grow monotonous, 
he adds an extra twist to each song — whether 
it be a deliciously unexpected bridge or an 

uplifting harmony — that 
jolts you out of your wistful 
daze. 

On longer tracks like 
“Time is Dancing,” Howard 
flirts with this tedium: 
Darker verses fade into a 
quiet bridge before snatch-
ing our attention back with 
a return to a shy but hope-
ful melody. This same trick 
shows up in the single “End 
of the Affair,” an epic eight-
minute track with an exten-
sive interlude. But perhaps 
the strongest track on 
Howard’s sophomore album 

is “Conrad,” a literary allusion founded in 
pulsing guitar riffs and memorable melodies 
that recalls Howard’s tendency toward shad-
owy self-reflection. If this tendency toward 
darker themes subtly influenced the optimism 
of “Every Kingdom,” then “I Forget Where We 
Were” is Howard fully embracing the gloom 
in a collection of powerfully nostalgic stories 
that brand him the master of melancholy.

Riley’s striking, emotional performance grounds tense play

unworthy of the challenge, encouraging 
the audience to clap along with him. His 
unabashed ambition for reputation suddenly 
halts when he realizes the danger, forcing 
him to ponder his actions when social unrest 
strikes the media about the possibility of 
an African-American defeating the white 
heavyweight champion.

Toward the end, Jackson can barely hold 
a steady rhythm of claps juxtaposed to his 
previously seamless efforts as he emotionally 
forces himself to make decisions onstage. 
These are tugged at by his sagacious coach 
Wynton (Ray Anthony Thomas) and greedy 
boxing promoter Max (John Lavelle), 
whose conflicting interests among the three 
contribute to a chaotic experience. This is only 
exacerbated by Jackson’s sister, Nina (Montego 
Glover), who fears not only for the safety of 

her brother but also the African-American 
community, as well. 

Each one of these actors comfortably dons 
their roles: There’s a dynamic between their 
relationship with Jackson that really makes 
him ponder his decisions wisely.

Part of playwright Ramirez’s brilliance is 
that Jackson’s internal strife makes it difficult 
to predict the outcome of the plot. Jackson’s 
world and journey in the spotlight is filled 
with sharp turns that contribute to the rigid, 
tense atmosphere toward the final 30 minutes 
of the play. Just as we think things are about 
to settle, the conflicting character’s desires 
complicates matters further — and these 
emotions show greatly in the final match. 

It’s a combination of brilliant staging, 
acting and structure of the play itself that 
contributes to a wonderful experience that 
flashes back to the struggles of African-
Americans in 1905.

Sono della 
California 

When meeting Italians, one 
of the first questions I get asked 
is, “Di dove sei?” (Where are you 
from?). I never respond, “Io sono 
Americana” (I’m American). 
Instead, I reply coolly, “Sono della 
California” (I’m Californian). If 
there’s anything I’ve learned, it’s that 
to Italians, being from California 
is seriously the coolest thing ever. 
Being American, on the other hand, 
means that there’s a good chance 
I will be associated with the likes 
of fast food, Honey Boo Boo and 
oversized everything. Whereas if I 
say I’m from California, everyone 
assumes I live by the beach, know at 
least one celebrity and that my life 
is exactly like The O.C. 

California is not only a cool 
place to be from but also an 
excellent conversation starter. 
Some frequent discussion points 
include how most of us have never 
actually met a celebrity, how if you 
go to San Francisco in August, it 
will probably be foggy and you’ll 
need a jacket and how avocado is 
basically a food sent straight from 
the gods. It’s weird that everyone 
here has such grandiose notions 
about the place I come from. For 
example, I was talking to this Italian 
guy at a language exchange event, 
explaining to him that I’m from Los 
Angeles, but I study in San Diego. 
And suddenly, it was as if just 
saying those city names alone made 
me the most interesting person in 
the room. The look on his face was 
a mix of disbelief and awe as he 
responded, “Ah che bello, San Diego 
e il mio sogno” (Wow, San Diego is 
my dream). This isn’t the only time 
I’ve gotten a reaction like this. In 
fact, almost every single time I say 
where I’m from, I feel like I should 
thank the movie industry people for 
glorifying California as some sort 
of mystical land and for upping my 
cool in social situations involving 
Italians. 

The next part of the conversation 
generally goes something like this: 
So if you already speak English and 
are from a place like California, 
then why would you choose to 
come here? This question kind 
of frustrates me; I mean, I guess 
it’s justified, but isn’t just loving 
the Italian language and culture 
enough? Italians don’t get it because 
so many of them just want to leave 
and learn English already. They 
think I’m a “pazza” (crazy person) 
for leaving sunny San Diego and 
coming here just because I like the 
way the Italian language sounds. In 
all honesty, I came here for more 
than just the language. I chose Italy 
because I wanted to experience 
a culture that, due to my Italian 
heritage, I’m already semifamiliar 
with. Even though I understood 
certain aspects about the Italian 
culture before I came here, I had 
no idea about all the little quirks 
that you can only really learn from 
living here and meeting people. It’s 
the whole figuring things out part 
that is so fun and challenging; that’s 
really what makes studying abroad 
so great. 

Whenever I start to miss 
California, I just keep in mind the 
old expression, “The grass is always 
greener,” which also exists in Italian, 
“L’erba del vicino e sempre piu 
verde,” because it’s true here too.

VINOS AND VISAS

“Birdman,” or “The Unexpected 
Virtue of Ignorance,” is about as 
odd a film as the title would suggest, 
but it is one of the most innova-
tive films in a long time. “Birdman” 
navigates a comedic and dramatic 
narrative, featuring doses of magic 
realism, dark comedy and emotion 
— too many tricks to be summed 
up in one film review. The director 
of “Birdman,” Alejandro Inarritu, 
is notorious for highly unconven-
tional, depressing films like “21 
Grams” and “Babel.” Fortunately, the 
eccentricity of “Birdman” did not 
come off as pretentious or painful to 
watch. This time, in contrast to Inar-
ritu’s previous films, the audience, 
like Inarritu, is having fun. 

“Birdman” tells the story of a 
down-on-his-luck actor, Riggen (Mi-
chael Keaton), who, many years ago, 

became a superstar for his role as 
Birdman in a blockbuster superhero 
franchise. Riggen — in part to regain 
a semblance of his former glory and 
in part to create something artistic — 
writes, directs and stars in a Broad-
way stage adaptation of Raymond 
Carver’s short story “What We Talk 
About When We Talk About Love.” 
We only ever see short snippets of 
the actual play since it serves mainly 
as a backdrop to the overall story, but 
part of the fun of “Birdman” is trying 
to connect the seemingly incoherent 
segments.

While producing the play, Rig-
gen experiences problems working 
with Mike (Edward Norton), an 
arrogant method actor, and familial 
tension with his recently rehabilitat-
ed daughter (Emma Stone). On the 
surface level, “Birdman” is a drama 

about a man overcoming adversity 
and battling his own ego to produce, 
what is in his mind, a work of art. 
Throughout the film, a voice inside 
Riggen’s head, the voice of super-
hero Birdman, mocks Riggen for 
attempting to put on a play, urging 
him to make a comeback in Holly-
wood with another Birdman sequel. 
This inner monologue reflects the 
cinematic binary between art and 
money. Make no mistake, however; 
this is not a pretentious art film, but 
an astute examination of the enter-
tainment industry underlined with 
dissatisfaction that big blockbusters 
like “Transformers” get all the atten-
tion while not representing anything 
artistic.

In “Birdman,” every aspect of 
filmmaking is either usefully imple-
mented or cleverly dissected. One of 
the most impressive ways that this is 
realized is through the film’s use of a 
seemingly single, continuous track-
ing shot for the majority of the film 
— although special effects were used 
to connect scenes to look continu-
ous. This technique was not used as 
a gimmick. The long take makes the 
film feel almost like a stage play, with 
everything happening live, giving the 
film a sense of relentlessness. In this 
day and age, when anything can be 
created with CGI, it is refreshing to 
experience a complicated, high-wire 
act like “Birdman” that will leave you 

questioning how it was made.
The casting, too, is cleverly done. 

Michael Keaton, made a celebrity 
through his role as Batman 25 years 
ago, phenomenally portrays a charac-
ter in a similar position as he person-
ally is in. Keaton has not starred in 
any noteworthy films since “Batman,” 
and his role as the Dark Knight gave 
him the chance to be a part of some-
thing special. Equally impressive is 
Edward Norton in his role as Mike, 
a brash actor who is difficult to work 
with on set, reflecting Norton’s own 
personal reputation for being hard 
to manage. Norton, who once played 
a superhero with anger issues, the 
Hulk, marvelously navigates between 
sympathy and comedic arrogance. 

“Birdman” is a unique, spell-
binding experience that combines 
everything that is great about film, 
including excellent performances, 
innovative filmmaking, original-
ity and great storytelling. It is an 
honest snapshot of Hollywood. The 
performances, notably Keaton’s and 
Norton’s, make this film stand out, 
but of course the biggest contribution 
was that of Alejandro Inarritu, who 
was able to make this unconven-
tional, artistic film one of the most 
entertaining, and certainly one of the 
best, films of the year.

whiplash
Director Damien Chazelle whips up an adrenaline-
inducing portrayal of a volatile jazz ensemble in-
structor who tortures students as part of a program 
to cultivate greatness. 

Imagine a young Beethoven play-
ing “Moonlight Sonata,” each chord 
transporting him through time and 
space; he’s so enraptured, fingers bat-
tered and bleeding, yet he continues 
to practice. Now imagine Beethoven’s 
music instructor leaning over him like 
a thundercloud, lacking the decency to 
wait until the piece is finished before 
reminding him, “You’re going to want 
to clean that blood off my keyboard.”

Now replace Beethoven with music 
student Andrew Neyman (the Miles 

Teller we all know and love from 
“The Spectacular Now”), trade in that 
keyboard for a drum set, and you’ve 
got yourself a film that accurately 
portrays “greatness” as it is whipped 
into shape. Director Damien Chazelle’s 
film “Whiplash,” which originally 
premiered as a short film in the 2013 
Sundance Film Festival, tells the story 
of Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons 
— yes, he played the kooky father 
in “Juno”), a monstrous college jazz 
ensemble instructor, and Neyman, the

one student who finds the courage to 
stand up for himself only to realize 
his goals don’t fall far from those of 
the brutish instructor himself.

A freshman at a well-established 
music conservatory, Neyman quickly 
learns he must snag a spot in Fletch-
er’s jazz ensemble if he ever wants to 
“make it” as a musician. But this is 
no simple task. Fletcher, an ex-leg-
end-turned-professor, is something 
akin to the spawn of your average, 
overbearing father and a Tyranno-
saurus rex. As the film progresses, 
he paints a black-and-white world 
in which one can either be average 
or great. If he was here now, he’d get 
really close to your face and warn, 
“Make that choice early on,” spitting 
between each word, “before you 
become average by default.” Chazelle 
outlines Neyman’s struggle: taking 
the time to incorporate both his 
broken family life and dysfunctional 
relationship with movie theater clerk, 
Nicole (Melissa Benoist).

Ordinarily, a subject as common 
as burnt-out-musician-becomes-
teacher-and-takes-anger-out-on-stu-
dents runs the risk of being cliche. 
But Chazelle sidesteps, skips — does 
just about everything short of calling 

a cab — to drive him far away from 
cliche. He has an uncanny ability to 
take a tired theme, add a teaspoon 
of dark comedy, along with a cup of 
extremity and end up with a unique 
rendition of a mundane concept. The 
most prominent example of this is 
when Neyman can’t match the tempo 
Fletcher has in mind — he spends 
hours teetering between two slow 
and too fast — until Fletcher smiles, 
retreats calmly to his desk and 
chucks a chair at Neyman’s head. It’s 
in these absurdities where the film 
finds its mojo. 

In terms of casting, Simmons was 
born to play Fletcher. In an interview 
with Entertainment Weekly, Chazelle 
calls Simmons his “muse.” Who else 
could go from, “Don’t worry just 
relax and have fun out there,” to an 
indignant, “I will fuck you like a 
pig” all within a matter of seconds? 
Despite all the pain he inflicts, a 
short scene depicting Fletcher play-
ing piano in a clandestine jazz club 
with eyes closed and a smile on his 
face, somehow renders him harm-
less. It takes a special kind of actor to 
simultaneously impress and disgust 
an audience.

While the Crowd Pleaser Award 
goes to Simmons, to ignore the mul-
tifaceted Teller — who, by the way, 

plays every single one of Neyman’s 
drum solos himself — would be a 
crime punishable by court of law. 
This duo is like ice cream and pie, 
best consumed together. The most 
satisfying scenes are without a doubt 
the ones in which Neyman challeng-
es Fletcher’s authority — bull against 
bullfighter. The audience relishes in 
the tension as they find out who will 
survive this clash of egos.

Of course, when this tension is 
paired with music by Justin Hurwitz 
— who composed original work and 
interspersed classic jazz standards by 
greats such as Duke Ellington — it 
culminates in some of the most ca-
thartic scenes in theaters this season.

On the whole — drum roll please 
— “Whiplash” raises the question, 
how far would you go to become a 
genius in your field? Hint: Neyman 
goes pretty damn far. This, ladies and 
gentlemen, is an all-or-nothing kind 
of film. If you can’t stand the heat, 
get out of the theater, as chances are, 
you’ll be sitting alongside Neyman in 
that stone-cold conservatory, pulling 
your hair out each time Fletcher so 
much as glances in your direction.

The 2–0 result brings the 
Tritons’ overall record to 9–4–2, 
and drops them to fourth in 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association standings at 4–2–2.

Pascale characterized the tough 
weekend as a learning experience 
for his squad.

“‘It was a good lesson in how 

hard it is to win on the road,” 
Pascale said. “You need to be 
mentally tough and really together 
as a group. To do well in this 
conference you can’t give these 
teams anything. We’re gonna need 
to be at our best to get the results 
we want.”  

With only three regular season 
matches remaining, UCSD will 
need to bear down to secure one 

of the six qualifying spots for the 
postseason come November. The 
Tritons will look to avoid losing 
ground in league standings as they 
face off against league fixtures 
again this week at Sonoma State on 
Friday, Oct. 24 and Humboldt State 
on Saturday, Oct. 25.

Junior Clayton Yamaguchi fin-
ished just short of his senior team-
mate and finished in 67th with a 240 
while hitting 24 over par.

Other Tritons who competed 
included junior Daniel Yang (244, 
+28), who tied for 74th and junior 
Jeff Roseth (248, +32) for 89th. Po-
land native and freshman Mateusz 
Kucz made his debut for the blue 
and gold, finishing 96th overall, 
swinging 40 over par with a 256.

“Matt Kucz didn’t play his best 
but he’s fitting into the team well,” 
Lim said. “Coach [Jim Ragan] has 
been working with him a lot and 
I see a lot of potential from him. 
Hopefully this performance will be 
motivation for him to practice hard-
er just like the rest of the team.”

No. 2 Nova Southeastern (+21) 
placed in first place, followed closely 
by British Columbia (+26) and host 
school Cal State Monterey Bay (+29).

UCSD is currently ranked 7th 
in the NCAA II West Region, trail-

ing familiar conference names such 
as Cal State Monterey Bay (first), 
Chico State (second), Cal State 
Stanislaus (third) and Sonoma State 
(fourth). 

With the conclusion of the fall 
season, the Tritons will be on hiatus 
until Feb. 23, when they resume their 
schedule at Cal State San Bernardi-
no for the Coyote Classic.

said. “We didn’t really have that clo-
sure inside their box. We got really, 
really solid chances that should have 
been goals. We were just unlucky.”

UCSD outshot San Francisco State 
16–7 while kicking eight corners to 
the Otters’ zero. Even in overtime 
when the Tritons tried to force the 
outcome of the game, San Francisco 
State’s Allison Land got the best of 
Callahan and her teammates. 

“The game on Sunday was com-
pletely dominated,” McManus said. 
“Again [it was] a little bit of lack of 

luck in the box. The players were 
disappointed in themselves not fin-
ishing it.”

With the win and tie on the week-
end, the Tritons sit in seventh place 
in the CCAA, currently just shy of 
postseason contention, as only the top 
six squads qualify for the conference 
championships. With every game on 
the line, the Tritons will look to climb 
the rankings when they travel to No. 8 
Sonoma State next Friday before mov-
ing on to Humboldt State on Sunday.

CLUB SPORTS

Women’s Rugby: The UCSD’s women’s rugby team played its first game of 
the season against Cal State Long Beach this past Saturday, Oct. 18. The game 
was unconventionally balanced with four, 20-minute quarters instead of the 
usual two 40-minute halves. With a limited amount of practice before the 
first game, veteran players relied on communication throughout the match 
to make on-the-fly adjustments. Despite the in-game improvement, UCSD 
lost by a narrow 28–27 score. The club sees action next in a hard match this 
Sunday against the more experienced San Diego Surfers Women’s Rugby 
Club B-Side.

Dragon Boat: The UCSD dragon boat team participated in the San Diego 
Dragon Boat Race this past weekend and placed both boats within the top 
three. At the end of six races, the A Boat finished second in the mixed divi-
sion and first overall in the college division, while the B Boat finished first in 
the mixed division and third overall in the college division. With the College 
Cup Race just three weeks away, UCSD’s dragon boat crews will be training 
to repeat their success in one of the most important races of the year. 

Field Hockey: Following a tough loss from the previous weekend, the UCSD 
field hockey club faced UC Santa Barbara for the first home game of 2014 
this past weekend. Early on, the Gauchos were able to take advantage of a few 
early opportunities and led UCSD 3–0 at the end of the first half. The Tritons 
improved in the second half but failed to capitalize on scoring opportunities, 
ultimately losing to UCSB 5–0. Despite the loss, Lori Pope had a phenom-
enal game, securing nine outstanding saves for UCSD. The Tritons return to 
the field this weekend with Saturday and Sunday games, both at 11 a.m. at 
Warren Field.

Sailing: Last weekend, four of the UCSD sailing team’s finest traveled to 
compete in the 26th Annual Stoney Burke Regatta held by UC Berkeley at 
Treasure Island. The wind failed to fill in until 11:15 a.m., allowing Varsity 
A to eventually get in one race and start on a second one before races were 
postponed due to unfavorable wind conditions. However, once the weather 
picked back up, both Varsity A and B teams were able to complete four 
races each. Sunday morning saw much of the same with weak wind. Finally, 
around 12:30 p.m., boats were sent out and both Varsity A and B were able 
to get in two races before packing up. UCSD ultimately finished 14th out of 
the 28-boat Varsity fleet.

Tritons Suffer Tough Road Weekend
MEN'S  SOCCER 

UCSD recorded a tie and a loss, while failing to score a goal in either of the in-league matches.

This past weekend, the UCSD men’s soccer team suffered a disappointing setback as it claimed just one point from two in-league away games. The Tritons were held to a goalless draw 
against Cal State Monterey Bay on Friday and suffered a 2–0 defeat to 
San Francisco State on Sunday.

Friday’s game saw UCSD travel to the Otter Sports Center, 
bringing with it a run of four unbeaten games and a perfect record 
against Cal State Monterey Bay in the previous four encounters. 
Though the home side looked to be an easy contest on paper, with a 
record of 2–6–3 coming in to the match, the Otters gave no leeway to 
the Tritons.

In an evenly matched first half, the teams managed only five shots 
between them, crediting a solid defensive display from both sides. The 
field did appear to open up more in the second period, as both teams 
had their share of chances. 

Sophomore midfielder Riley Harbour led the UCSD offensive, 
managing a game-high four attempts on goal. However, in spite of his 
and the team’s best efforts, the match ultimately ended goalless. Junior 
goalkeeper Cameron McElfresh took from the match an impressive 
seventh clean sheet of the season. 

“As time has gone on, the defense has started to click and I’ve 
started to feel more comfortable,” McElfresh said. “Everyone really 
knows how to defend, which makes my job a whole lot easier.”

The draw extended the Tritons to a run of five games unbeaten, 
though their streak would end on Sunday. 

While Friday’s contest perhaps lacked in excitement, Sunday’s 
match against San Francisco State was a dramatic affair that ultimately 
ended in disappointment for UCSD. 

“We were chasing the game and they played really well,” UCSD 
head coach Jon Pascale said. “When you go down a goal on the road, 
it’s really hard to get back into it. We had a couple of chances to do 
well, but we didn’t capitalize.” 

The match began at a blistering pace with San Francisco State’s 
Jakob Velega hitting the post just 49 seconds into play. The Tritons 
responded with a flurry of attacking play, managing four shots within 
the first eight minutes. 

Sophomore forward Malek Bashti came closest to scoring for the 
Tritons when his attempt was cleared just off the line. Despite UCSD’s 
efforts, it was the hosts that struck first on the 39-minute mark via a 
well-converted shot from the Otters’ Kevin Johnson. 

Cal State Monterey Bay soon doubled its lead after intermission 
when junior defender Sam Merritt struck home a free kick from just 
outside the 18-yard box in the 56th minute. Although the Tritons did 
outshoot their opponents 11–10, they failed to clinch a score for the 
second straight match.

Win, Tie Lifts Tritons Up in Standings
Tritons win tight game against CSUMB and record scoreless tie versus SF State.

The UCSD women’s soccer 
team started a four-game road trip 
this past weekend with two games 
against California Collegiate Ath-
letic Association foes. The Tritons 
ended the pair of matches with two 
consecutive shutouts: a 1–0 win at 
Cal State Monterey Bay on Friday 
and a 0–0 tie at San Francisco State 
on Sunday. UCSD moved to 6–5–3 
overall and 3–3–2 in the CCAA.

It was a penalty kick in the 84th 
minute that helped the Tritons get 
past Cal State Monterey Bay on Fri-
day. Senior midfielder Cassie Cal-
lahan notched the game-winning 
score for her fourth goal on the sea-
son, tied for the team high. Calla-
han now has 11 game-winning goals 
over her four-year career. 

“Our issue this year is that we 
have a hard time scoring goals even 
though we have been playing well,” 
Callahan said. “In the second half, 
when a penalty kick was called for 
us, I knew immediately that I want-
ed to take it.”

That goal and the victory helped 
the Tritons leapfrog their opponents 
of the day in league standings to 
take sole possession of seventh place 
in the conference.

The Tritons dominated the first 
period with UCSD outshooting the 
Otters but failing to capitalize. Cal 
State Monterey Bay came back firing 
after the intermission, putting heavy 
pressure on junior goalie Kelcie 
Brodsky. However, Brodsky held her 
ground to deliver her second clean 
sheet of the year and improve her 
save total to a league-leading 61 on 
the season.

“The second half was a much 
tighter game,” UCSD head coach 
Brian McManus said. “The first half 
we dominated the game but couldn’t 

get the goal. Cassie Callahan stepped 
up. She is a leader of the team, and 
that’s what she does.”

The Tritons rode a two-game 
winning streak into Sunday’s game 
at San Francisco State. Brodsky had 
four saves in her second consecutive 
shutout, but UCSD ultimately came 
out with a scoreless tie as the 110 
minutes played were not enough to 
separate the two teams.

“We were playing really well, 
connecting really well,” Callahan

MEN'S  GOLF

UCSD Suffers Poor Play
Golf stumbles against strong schools at Otter Invite.  

Concluding its fall season, the 
UCSD men’s golf team recorded a dis-
appointing finish this past Monday at 
Cal State Monterey Bay’s annual Ot-
ter Invitational, placing 18th among a 
tough field of schools, including No.1 
Barry University, No. 2 Nova South-
eastern University and No. 4 Lynn 
University. League opponents from the 
California Collegiate Athletic Asso-
ciation included No. 5 Chico State and 
No. 12 Cal State Stanislaus.

As a group, UCSD swung +104 
on the par 72, 6,869-yard Bayonet 
Black Horse Course.

Senior Jay Lim had the best finish 
for the Tritons, tying for the 65th spot, 
swinging 23 over par. In round one, 
Lim was able to finish with just 1 over 
par, the lowest round of the tourna-
ment by any Triton but could not ex-
tend his impressive play in the follow-
ing two rounds.

“I think playing in a tough field 
shows our weaknesses as a team, and 
now we know what we have to do in or-
der to compete with these teams,” Lim 
told the UCSD Guardian. “Although it 
was a terrible performance from us, it 
gives us motivation for the offseason to 
get better so I think there’s a huge ben-
efit from this tournament.”
