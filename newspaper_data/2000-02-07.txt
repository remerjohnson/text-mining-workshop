said, he must sell his agenda 
more powerfully to hard-core

Even as he expressed opti-

seemed to concede what many

his own supporters, said in inter-

be effectively over in four weeks

Investment Seminar to Be Held 
MONEY: Tuesday's event designed to help students gain fmanciaI ease 
By MATT ICHRADIR 
sr"" *'iter 

With the economic future of 
students and alumni in mind, 
an A.S. Council financial semi-
nar designed to teach the fun-
damentcils of the investing 
world will be held Thesday at 
the Price Center Ballroom A 
from 4:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. 
. "Many students have saved 

money in savings or checking 
accounts collecting little or no 
interest," said Eric Rovner, A.S. 
vice president finance and the 
main organizer of this event. 

"Those same dollars can be 
invested, just as they would be 
in a savings account in some-
thing a bit more aggressive with 
more return." 

Students and staff participat-
ing in the event will learn about 
basic investing terms such as 
stocks, mutual funds and IRAs 
from speeches and presentations 
given by three UCSD bus~ 
alumni and Rovner himself. 

Rovner said that learning 
these basic skills at an early age 
will be very useful and prof-
itable to those in attendance, as 
investing in the future will be a 

made a lot simpler once finan-
cial stability has been estab-
lished. 

"If you start saving and 
investing by educating yourself 
now as college students, it will 
be that much more prosperous 
and beneficial when we have 
the big bucks to invest, for we 
started at an earlier age," he 
said. "Students will learn how 
simple, easy and fun investing 
can be." 

In addition, Rovner said that

Athletes 
Given 
Priority 
DECISION: Sports 
participants will be 
allowed to register early 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Senior Staff Writer 

For the first time, athletes at 
UCSD will be granted priority 
registration, according to Richard 
Backer, assistant vice chancellor 
of enrollment management and 
registrar. 

Starting Fall of 2000, athletes 
will be at the top of the list as far 
as the rush for classes is con-
cerned. 

"It was a matter of the athlet-
ic department being in touch 
with this office," Backer said . 
"They wanted to have priority 
registration for athletes. They 
came to me, and we had a dis-
cussion." 

Acting Athletic Director 
Regina Sullivan said the decision 
will allow athletes to have more 
uniform practice sessions and 
studying hours. 

"It will allow them to excel 
academically," Sullivan said. 
"Classes and practices won't con-
flict. It was a problem for stu-
dents who were athletes. They 
will be able to focus on both [ath-
letics and academics)." 

Backer also pointed to other 
factors. 

"It would be more helpful for 
coaches," he said. ''That was my 
primary decision maker." 

Athletes will not be the first 
group to gamer priority registra-
tion status. Other groups on cam-
pus that also have such privileges

"The problem came about 
very quiclcly. This past 
weekend it was using every 
last inch of bandwidth. "

COMPUIINCt Officials said MP3-sharing software was slowing campus Internet connections 

NtIws EdItor 

UCSD Residential Network-
ing (ResNet) blocked access last 
weekend to Napster, a software 
that allows people to share MP3 
files. ResNet officials said that 
use of the software was slowing 
campus Internet traffic. 

ResNet Coordinator Erik 
Strahm said that the measure is 
only temporary. 

Napster is a client IIOftware 
that provides people with a way 
of sea~ for and download-
ing MP3 files from the computers 
of other users. 

In a letter sent out to all 
ResNet SUbscribers, ResNet offi-
cials said that they saw the use 
of Napster increase at an incred-

ible rate over the last six 
months. 

The letter stated that last 
weekend, Napster uploads and 
downloads saturated the campus 
Internet connection, slowing all 
campus Internet traffic and 
impairing the vital functions of 
the network such as education 
and research. 

"The problem came about 
very quiddy," Strahm said. NThis 
past weekend it was using every 
last inch of bandwidth." 

Most students were upset 
with last weekend's decision. 

"It angered me a little," 
Warren freshman Lauren Lee 
said. NWe pay so much to live 
here; we should be able to access 
whatever we want." 

Lee said she hopes that 

ResNet finds a way to reverse the 
blockage. 

") am definitelr missing 
Napster," she said." hope they 
find some way for us to start 
accessing it again." 

Muir sophomore Robert 
Etzler said that the university 
needs to find a permanent solu-
tion. 

. NIn reality, if what they say is 
true about the network being 
slowed down, then they need to 
update the network," he said. 

Etzler said that ResNet's deci-
sion to block access to Napster 
shows that they place a lower 
value on Napster than on other 
file formats. He said that while 
Napster is mostly used for shar-
ing music files, it could have 
otheru~. 

"Theoretically, if someone 
wanted to post speeches or nar-
rations as MP3 files, Napster pro-
vides an excellent way of sharing 
them." 

Strahm said that while the 
university does not monitor 
what students are doing on the 
Internet, they do evaluate where 
high bandwidth connections are 
going. 

"It is UCSD's policy that stu-
dents can do what they want as 
long as it does not cause a prob-
lem," he said. "This has caused I 
problem. Unfortunately we had 
to take measures to solve the 
problem." 

Strahm said he will be worll, 
ing with residential life offices II 
each of the colleges to set • 
informational meetings. 



~NEWS 

FINANCE: 
Investment seminar 
will cost $2,000 
CoIItIRued tro. ..... 1 
interest of investing online and e-
trading made this seminar even 
more important. 

"I thought this would be a 
good opportunity for students to 
see what all the hype was about, 
especially since the e-trade 
became so popular, and everyone 
knows that Generation X lives on 
the Internet all day," he said. 

for students, some of the 
interest in this event lies in the 
knowledge and potential finan-
cial earnings of the stock market. 

"[Investing) is certainly a way 
to make lots of money," said Muir 
freshman Jon Russo. "There have 
certainly been a lot of people who' 
have done really well." 

According to the organizers of 
this event - A.S. Program 
Coordinator Tammie Traudt, A.S. 
Marketing Director Traci Davee 
and Rovner - the seminar is also 
designed to rid the notion that 
investing is not for students. 

"Investing has always been 
considered stereotypicaJfy a rich 
man's game or an older person's 
duty," Rovner said. "I want stu-
dents to realize that this isn't the 

ca~ and that we must start edu-
cating ourselves now as opposed 
to later." 

In an effort to end this belief, the 
A.S. Council brought in three 
alumni involved in the business 
world who agreed to speak free of 
chaIge. They are Al Davis, of Nike 
Securities; Bill Fitzmaurice, a finan-
cial consultant with A.G. Edwards 

and Sons, Inc.; and Martin Shapiro, 
the president of Wealth and Tax 
Specialists company. 

"This group was chosen 
because they know the business 
better than anyone and they are 
always looking to give back to the 
unive.rsity any way possible," 
Rovner said. "These are paid pro-
fessionals giving UCSD students 
free financial advice." 

After each alumnus's 15-
minute presentation, the panel 
will open up to a question-and-
answer period where students 
may comment or question on the 
material presented to them. After 
the presentations, those in atten-
dance will have a chance to meet 
the alumni on an individual basis 
to discuss questions further. 

With the presenters deciding 
to speak for free, the cost of the 
investment seminar is mini-
mized, as only the marketing, 
catering and miscellaneous costs 
had to be paid. The approximate 
$2,000 cost for the event, which is 
split between the A.5. Council . 
and the Alumni Association, cov-
ers the free hors d'oeuvres and 
packets of information and calcu-
lators for each participant. 

In addition, Traudt said the 
first SO people in attendance will 
receive additional investment 
booklets. 

In response to the pertinent 
and useful information the semi-
nar has to offer, Traudt said she 
already signed up 150 people 
willing to attend on Tuesday. 

Responding to the popular 
interest, Traudt expects other sim-
ilar seminars to be held in the 
future.

Researchers are studying whether this method will 
provide similar pain relief with fewer side effects. In 
another type of study related to breast cancer, 
researchers are comparing a new biopsy technique

PINION 

Passing Proposition lA is essential to Indians' sutvival 
and will help to repair two centuries of abuse 
By PARISA BAHARIAN 
Staff Writer 

Nevada casinos and gambling foes are 
out on the warpath to destroy California 
Indians' right to determine their own des-
tiny. The source of controversy is 
Proposition lA, an initiative that would 
allow Indian self-reliance to continue 
through the gaming casinos located on 
their tribal lands. 

The influential Nevada casinos, threat-
ened by the Indians' gaming, waged a 
dirty campaign and won last year by hav-
ing Proposition 5, whiuch was backed by 
two-thirds of voters, overturned on a tech-
nicality by California's Supreme Court. 

Voter-approved PropoSition 5 would 
have allowed the Indians to continue to 
support their own people through the jobs 
and services created by running casinos on 
tribal land. After the 
California Supreme 

running federally approved gaming casi-
nos on their lands for over ten years now. 
In 1988, federal law recognized the right 
of Indian tribes to have limited and regu-
lated gaming on their tribal land. 

Indian gaming casinos bring so many 
benefits to the Indian people and to 
California that it is necessary to pass 
Proposition lA. These Indian casinos have 
vastly improved the standard of living of 
their people by providing much-needed 
jobs. 

After generations of extreme poverty, 
and dependency, hope now Uirives on the 
reservations. Since the operation of Indian 
casinos began, unemployment on reserva-
tions with casinos has dropped nearly 50 
percent, and the amount of people depen-
dent on welfare has been cut by 68 per-
cent, if not entirely eliminated on some 
tribal lands. The revenues from the tribal 

lands with casinos are 

Court declared 
Proposition 5 unconsti-
tutional, Gov. Gray 
Davis and the California 
Legisla ture negotiated 
and signed compacts 
with the Indians that 
would continue to allow 
the tribes to run their 

ro 
shared with non-casino 
tribes. This provides 
decent housing, clean 
water supplies, better 
education and health 
care for all their people. 

Indian gaming on 
tribal lands benefits all 
Californians by provid-
ing nearly 50,000 jobs for 
Indians and non-Indians casinos. 

Now, once again, it is up to the voters 
to decide if the Indians have the right to 
control their own futures through regulat-
ed gaming on their tribal lands. 

Proposition lA must be passed, or vot-
ers will strip the Indians of their only key 
to survival. 

The argument that is posed by many 
opponents of the proposition is that no 
form of gambling should be allowed in 
California as stated by the state constitu-
tion. First, the state has already accepted 
gambling as a legitimate means to fund 
state schools through the lottery. 
Institutionalized gambling is run by the 
state; therefore the opponents' arguments 
are without merit. 

Secondly, California Indians have been 

and producing $120 million annually in 
state and local taxes. Proposition lA saves 
taxpayers $50 million in tax dollars annu-
ally by moving tribal members off the 
welfare rolls and into the work force. 

The San Francisco Chronic/e, which sup-
ports Proposition lA, took this stand in an 
editorial: "These tribes have built a $1.4 bil-
lion a year business that supports tens of 
thousands of jobs and has allowed the 
reservations to build and improve schools, 

hou~ing and health care systems. They 
deserve a chance to maintain the quality of 
life they have attained." ("Yes on Indian 
Gambling," Oct 10,1998)

Increased dependence on the highly volatile gaming 
industry would only hann California Indian tribes 
By IRENTDON 
Opinion Editor 

America is a land divided. This fact is 
not often discussed publicly because it 
brings up an uncomfortable reminder of 
one of the darker periods of this nation's 
history. One million people live on 57 
million acres of land within the United 
States that is the sovereign territory of 
512 autonomous nations, which are for 
tpe most part independent of the U.S. 
federal government. These lands are 
Indian reservations. 

The system of Indian reservations was 
initiated by the Indian Removal Act of 
1830, which sought to relocate the native 
inhabitants of the eastern United States 
to lands in the western territories. This 
was the relatively merciful alternative to 
the campaign of genOcide that the United 
States had previously 

so called "Nevada-style casinos" - on 
tribal lands. 

Proposition lA is an amendment to 
California's constitution that would 
remove the eXisting limitation on slot 
machines and house-banked card games 
on tribal lands. Other types of gambling 
are also pending - 11 tribes concluded 
compacts with the legislature of 
California in 1998 to conduct lottery 
games, off-track betting. video machines 
and non-banked card games. The pas-
sage of Proposition 29 would formally 
approve these more limited compacts, 
but the passage of Proposition 1A would 
make these agreements obsolete by 
granting compacts allowing class III 
gambling to 57 California tribes, includ-
ing the 11 tribes with pending compacts. 

Indian gaming is supposed to help 
promote Indian self-reliance, but the rev· 

enue that casinos pro-
been waging against 
the Indian tribes of 
America. The more 
than 500 federally rec-
ognized Indian tribes 
were relocated to 278 
reservations through-
out the United States

Bureau of Indian 
Affairs. The tribes

vide is completely at 
the mercy of the rest of

were granted independent governments, 
which .allowed them to manage affairs 
within their lands but at the same time 
allowed the federal government to retain 
ultimate control over their land. 

The latest controversy to arise over 
this peculiar system of nations-within-a-
nation revolves around gambling on 
Indian lands. 

California's upcoming election fea-
tures two Propositions on the subject -
Proposition lA and Proposition 29. 
PropoSition lA seeks to remedy the con-
flict with California's constitution which 
nullified Proposition 5, a measure that 
passed in California's 1998 election, 
which would have granted Indian tribes 
the right to operate class III gambling -

spend, the gambling 
industry rides the wave of affluence 
along with the rest of the economy. But if 
the econmny suddenly takes a nose dive, 
gambling revenue follows suit. 

The gambling industry does not gen. 
erate any rroductive capital. It merely 
leeches of the rest of the economy. 
Economic systems that rely solely on the 
influx of wealth are extremely vulnerable 
to collapse. 

The most dramatic historical example 
of this can be found in the case of the 
Spanish empire (an Ironic example con-
sidering Spanish conquests destroyed the 
vast majority of Indian dvilizations). For 
a hundred years, Spain grew rich on the

United Nations Intervenes in Congo WIN: 
Indian gaming helps 
tribes ~gain respect 
eDit. • .. ".. ..... 4 

COMMENTARY: Effectiveness of international peacekeeping 
intervention will have an impact on the organization's image and future 
By DIVYA RUNCHAL 
Staff Writer 

Recently, the United Nations 
decided to expand its role in 
bringing peace to Congo, a war-
tom region where two ethnic 
communities have each brought 
about destruction and wide-
spread human rights abuses. 

Since June, the conflict 
between the Hema and the 
Lendu tribes has resulted in at 
least 5,000 deaths and hundreds 
of thousands displaced from 
their homes. It has taken several 
months for the United Nations 
to finally recognize that unless it 
does something soon, it will 
have another Rwanda on its 
hands, where more than 800,000 
members of one ethnic commu-
nity were slaughtered while the 
world looked on. 

However, it is unclear how 
soon and how efficiently the 
United Nations will be able to 
bring peace, since it is unclear 
whether the United States is 
willing to allot tens of millions 
of dollars to the United Nations 

The 

- the United States is billed 
more than 30 percent of United 
Nations peace-Keeping costs. 

It is clear that if the United 
States balks at the costs, then it 
will be difficult to ensure that 
thousands of peace-keeping 
troops, medical aid and air and 
water transportation experts 
will go at all. However, the 
United Nations recognizes that 
this may be its last chance in 
showing the global community 
that it can do a job efficiently 
and without bloodshed, rather 
than remain embarrassed for its 
passive stance during the 1994 
Rwanda conflict. 

To many outsiders looking in 
on the events in Congo, the civil 
war is one of the bloodiest and 
brutal ever known. Men, 
women and even infants are 
slaughtered with machetes and 
other crude weapons. It seems 
unlikely that the conflict 
between the farming tribes -
the Lendu and the richer Hema, 
who own most of the land -
will stop any time soon, since it 
has been going on for over a 

year. Divisions between neigh-
boring regions have also f0s-
tered tension and strife in the 
Congo community. Although 
the job is dangerous, the United 
Nations bears the responsibility 
to help ease the conflict and 
bring peace to a land that is rid-
den with political and economi-
cal strife. If the United Nations 
expands its role in Congo and 
pushes for thousands of troops 
to be sent to the region, it will be 
demonstrating to the leaders of 
the world that it will take an 
active stance to bring harmony 
between warring regions. It is 
the last chance for the United 
Nations to save face when many 
members of the global commu-
nity are skeptical of its effective-
ness. 

The United Nations faces a 
moral choice: Either it takes 
responsibility for its past inept-
ness and makes a strong choice 
to help the citizens of Congo, or 
it sits back and allows another 
Rwanda-like genocide to ha~ 
pen.

moral offense, no one has the 
right to take the Indians' new-
found economic freedom from 
them. Just because the state of 
Nevada and their casinos stand 
to lose over $300 million because 
of the competition with the 
Indian casinos, It doesn't give 
them the right to decide whether 
the Indians must give up this 
particular way of making a liv-
ing. 

Only the Indians can decide 
that, and they have proven over 
the last 10 years that their gaming 
casinos actually benefit all 
Californians. 

Voter approval of Proposition 
1A will once and for all make it 
legal for the Indians to carry out 
gaming on their tribal lands. If 
Proposition 1A fails, Indian casi-
nos in California will be shut 
down and all the economic bene-
fits they provide to Indians and to 
all Californians will be lost.

lA, Nevada casinos will be

tion of Californii's IndIan 
casinos safely quashed. 

According to the many Indian 
tribes, Indian gaming is the 
bridge being used to help regain 
the self-respect that was taken 
from them long ago. 

The U.S. govemment took 
Indian lands and forced them to 
live on worthless land that no one 
wanted because nothing could be 
cultivated there. The government 
and all the citizens it represents 
segregated the Indians from the 
reSt 01 society b banishing them 
to these reservatk,ns. The majority 
of the indians had no way to make 
a living and were forced to go on 
welfare. Only the Indians know 
what a terrible blow to their self-
confidence that must have been to 
have their lives wrenched away 
and given no means to begin anew 
on the reservations. 

Yet today, the Indians have the 
means to take back their lives, to 
regain their self-respect, self-deter-
mination and economic self-suffi-
ciency through Indian .. 

How can we deny ~L 
the right to control their own 
lives alter aU that has been taken 
from them? 

Now we have the chance to set 
the record right: Vote yes on

ing itself. The economy col-
lapsed and Spain forever lost its 
role as a world power. 

Similarly, Indian gaming may 
be profitable in the short term, 
but it creates an economy that 
cannot survive on its own. The 
short-Sighted plan for Indian 
"self-reliance" proposed by the 
advocates of Indian gaming will 
only make the tribes more 
dependent on the rest of the 
nation than ever before. 

Anyone who has seen or read 
advertisements in favor of 1998's 
Proposition 5 or this year's 
Proposition lA is familiar with 
the Indian rhetoric vilifying 
Nevada casinos that r.roponents 
claim are trying to stifle compe-
tition. However, in the wake of 
the successful passage of 
Proposition 5 these same casinos 
have decided to hedge their bets 
by cooperating with California 
tribes instead of futilely oppos-
ing them again. 

Nevada interests have cur-
rently signed agreements to 
finarice tliree casinos on tribal 
lands, deals worth $290 million. 
The increased gambling that 
Proposition 1A would aUow can-
not help but attract traditional 
gambling interests that are eager 
to take advantage of those tribes 
who cannot fund their own large-
scale casinos. This results in a 
system where Nevada casinos 
actually end up profiting from 
Indian gaming In Califomia and 
taking money from the tribes that 
this proposition was designed to 
exclusively benefit. 

Far from empowering Indian 
tribes, the passage of Proposition 
lA would merely relegate them 
to a role as casino workers super-
vised by Nevada casino interests. 
The passage of the more reason-
able Proposition 29 would still 
afford them many of the econom-
ic benefits gambling has to offer 
without betting the entire future 
of all of California's tribes on the 
gaming industry.

Attention New York entrepre-

When the first people tried to 
start Internet companies here in 
the mid-'90s, they had to 
scrounge to raise money. To their 
chagrin, the big Silicon Valley 
venture capital firma like Draper

New York as a backwater with no 
history of entrepreneurship or 
technological innovation. 

But now with the success of a 
wide range of Internet and new-
media companies in and around 
New York City, including the 
stock market darlings 
DoubleClick and 5tarMedia 
Network, there are an abundance 
qf new and newly expanded ven-
ture capital funds in New York, 
with many hundreds of millions 
of fresh dollars looking for young 
Internet businesses to invest in -
in hopes of a big payoff when the

or gets acqUired.

That will include, if Con-

include regent scholars, stu-

campus visitors from other UC 
institutions and education 
abroad students. 

While the other groups with 
priority have only a few in num-
ber, it is a different story regard-
ing Triton athletes. 

"This will gives us about 
1,500 students with priori~ reg-
istration," Backer said. "It s less 
than either Berkeley or UCLA." 

The action comes just before 
UCSn's move from Division UI 
athletics to Division II athletics. 

"A majority of Division II 
schools do offer priority regis-
tration," Sullivan said. "All UCs 
do except Santa Cruz." 

With all of the moves regard-
ing athletics, there is concem 
that the school may be leaning . 
more toward sports and stray-
ing from academics. 

"With the move to Division 
II, it's an opportunity to com-
pete at a higher level, but as far 
as academics are concerned, we 

NEWS 7 

are still very froud and it is still 
the focus 0 the university," 
Sullivan said. "The priority reg-
istration will enable the athletes 
to do better." 

Backer said that the change 
will not shift the focus from aca-
demics to athletics. 

"I don't think giving priority 
registration diminishes the stu-
dent-athlete title," Backer said. 
"It enhances it because the way 
it was scheduled before, it was 
hard to have practice. It now 
allows more consistent studying 
time. It provides more struc-
ture." 

Another fear is that UCSD 
may be going down the path to 
offering athletes athletic scholar-
ships. 

"It's not somethin§ I think 
about," Sullivan said. 'With the 
move to Division II, I can't think 
about that." 

Sullivan said that most ath-
letes meet higher academic stan-
dards than non-athletes. 

"Athletes are required to 
meet NCAA standards that are 
beyond UCSD requirements," 
she said. "If someone drops a 
class and goes below 12 units, 
it's a di.fferent standard. Athletes 
have to maintain 12 units a 
quarter." 

Army Aims for Uvable Housing 
FORT MEADE, Md. - The 

Pentagon is starting to redress 
the old problem of military 
housing, a major reason, along 
with the military's health care, 
that midcareer service members 
leave the armed forces. The 
Pentagon budget that is being 
unveiled on Monday includes a 
$3 billion increase over five 
years for housing allowances. 

Under the Pentagon's plan. 
miUtary housing would beCome 
a major selling point for staying 
in the service rather than a rea-
son for leaving. 

This year Secretary of 
Defense William Cohen says he 
wants to attack the housing 
problem, bolstering the housing 
allowances for those who live off 
base and improving housing on 
the bases. 

"Good hOUSing is a top pri-
ority," Cohen said . "It aug-
ments our ability to attract and 
retain the quality individuals 
America's military needs." 

The military is also attracting 
men and women who have larg-
er families - having three chil-
dren is common - at earlier 
ages. They need the type of help 
that bases are especiciUy good at 

providing while a father or a 
mother is away for an operation 
or training.

ject to privatize housing here

and at two other Army posts. 
Developers will be awarded con-
tracts to build new housing. 
rebuild the bases' substandard 
units, and add community cen-
ters, landscaping. sports facili-
ties and whatever else it takes to 
remake the posts in the mold of 
middle-class communities. 

The contracts are to be 
awarded by August, and con-

struction is to begin next year. If 
the project works, it could be a 
model (or privatizing housing at 
other bases. 

The contract for the housing 
at Fort Meade could amount to 
$2 billion, a sum normally asso-
ciated with military contracts for 
jet fighters. 

The program is so ambitious 
that military housing is being 

sin~led out by investors as a 
majOr emerging market. 
Moody's Investors Service, a 
bond-rating company, has said 
that any bonds to finance the 
housing projects would be eligi-
ble for an A rating. one of the top 
three categories. 

"This is where the military 
has a trump card over civilian 
SOCiety," said Charles Moskos, 
a sociologist at Northwestern 
University who studies the mil-
itary. "The military can never 
offer more pay than civilian 
society, but they can give 
young families the decent 
housing and good schools that 
their civilian contemporaries 
can't afford ."

Clinton Planning to Ask for More Money 
to Fight Child Labor Overseas 

President Clinton plans to 
ask Congress to more than dou-
ble the nation's spending on 
reducing child labor overseas, 
administration officials said 
Sunday. 

These officials said Clinton, 
in the budget he is submitting to 
Congress on Monday, would ask 
for $110 million toward fighting 
the use of child labor, up from 
$45 million budgeted for the cur-
rent fiscal year. The proposed 
spending increase woufd be 
uSed primarily to move children 
out of the workplace and into 
school. 

The International Labor 
Organization estimates that 
around the world, more than 
2SO million chiJdren age 14 and 
under are working in jobs that 
include making clothes, rugs 
and fireworks and in mining. 
domestic work and· prostitu-
tion. 

Gene Sperling, Clinton's 
national economic adviser, said 

the proposed spending increase 
reflected a greater focus on 
reducing child labor and on soft-
ening the harshest effects of 
globalization. 

When Clinton came into 
office, the United States was 
spending $3 million annually on 
trying to reduce chUd labor. 

"The president feels that this 
is an example of a win-win strat-
egy to ensure that the globaliza-
tion process is consistent with 
very basic, universal values 
about not profiting off the low-
paid hazardous work of chil-
dren," Sperling said. 

This planned spending 
increase comes after developing 
nations denounced the adminis-
tration's proposal, made in 
December at the World Trade 
Organization'S meeting in 
Seattle, to create a task force that 
might recommend trade sanc-
tions against countries that 
aUow the use of child labor or 
violations of other basic labor 

rights: 
Officials from develoring 

countries have said that i the 
United States is serious about 
wanting to reduce child labor, it 
should not threaten trade sanc-
tions. Instead, they say, it should 
work with developing nations to 
move child workers into schools 
and to create better-paying jobs 
for poor parents so they do not 
feel the need to send their chil-
dren to work. 

"This child labor initiative is 
very sil'tnificant because we are 
definitely taking the lead in the 
world community in the money 
the president is putting up to 
fight this problem," said Sen. 
Tom Harkin, [)'Iowa, who has 
sponsored numerous bills 
against child labor. "I think this 
new initiative has an excellent 
chance of getting through 
Congress."

ACADEMIC 

When it comes to nutrition, college students usually fail. 
Developing a balanced diet requires eating a variety 

of healthy foods as close to the natural source as possible. 

We hear it from parents, teachers and coaches while growing up: Eat a variety of healthy foods that are as close to their natural forms as possi-ble, and consume five to six serv-
ings of fruits and vegetables a day, not too much fat 
and not too much sugar. We are inundated with mag-
azines, journals, newspapers and health classes. 

Even with all the information available regarding 
proper nutrition, distinguishing fact from fiction is 
still difficult. A diet defident in vitamins and miner-
als can be as damaging as a diet overabundant in 
other areas. Por college students, nutrients are often 
the last consideration after price, ease of meal prepa-
ration and calorie content. 

Food choices can Significantly impact a students 
lifestyle; however, eating healthy can reduce the risk 
of chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, dia-
betes, stroke and osteoporosis, which are the leading 
causes of death and disability among Americans. 
You Are Whllt You Eat 

A student's attitude and quality of life are affected 
by the vitamins and minerals they consume, accord-
ing to clinical depression expert Nancy Schimelpfen-
ing. A deficiency in B-complex vitamins, for example, 
can lead to symptoms of depreSsion. 

B-comflex vitamins are essential to mental and 
emotiona well-being and cannot be stored in our 
bodies, so we depend entirely on our daily diet to 
supply them. These vitamins are destroyed by alco-
hol, refined sugars, nicotine and caffe.ine. 

Mineral deficiencies can also cause depression, 
according to Schimelpfening. The depletion of calci-
um, zinc, iron, manganese and potassium can be 
associated with symptoms such as weakness, fatigue, 
apathy, irritability, nervousness, anxiety, lack of 
appetite and headaches. 

Long-term consumption of appropriate amounts 
of vitamins and minerals is also necessary for overall 
physical health. In a 17-year research study of more 
than 10,000 people, nutrition experts in the United 
Kingdom found that those who ingested fresh fruit 
daily were 24 percent less likely to experience a fatal 
heart attack and were 32 percent less likely to have a 
fatal stroke. 
Guidelines 

The key to good nutrition is variety. The United 
States Department of Agriculture's food guide pyra-
mid recommends substituting fruits, vegetables and 
even greater portions of breads, cereals and pastas for 
fa ts, dairy products, oils and anything with refined 
sugar. 

The USDA makes several basic recommendations 
for daily eating habits. These include eating a variety 
of foods, balancing the food you eat with physical 
activity to maintain or improve body weight, choos-
ing a diet low in fat , saturated fat and cholesterol 
while high in grain products, vegetables and fruits. 
Moderate use of sugars, salt and sodium is impor-
tant, as well. 

Moderate use of alcohol is also recommended. 

chief source of proteins and provides vitamin B-1, 
iron, niacin, phosphorus and starch. One or two daily 
servings of foods from this group are recommended. 

Group two of the food pyramid consists of leafy, 
green and yellow vegetables. Vegetables supply large 
amounts of vitamin A, B vitamins, vitamin C, calcium 
and iron. They also provide fiber, which helps regu-
late the intestines. Nutritionists recommend one or 
more daily servings from this group. 

Group three consists of citrus fruits, raw cabbage, 
salad greens, tomatoes and juice. These foods are 
good sources of vitamin C, vitamin A, calcium and 
iron. One or more daily servings is suggested. 

Group four and five consist of potatoes, other veg-
etables and non-citrus fruits. This includes all vegeta-
bles and fruits not in groups two and three. Addi-
tionally, bread, breakfast cereals and flour-based 
products are in these groups. Four to five daily serv-
ings of food from these groups are recommended. 

Group seven consists of dairy products. Milk and 
cheese are sources of vitamin A, vitamin B-2, calcium 
and proteins. Adults should have one to two daily 
servings of food from group seven. 
Veeet.rlMlem 

The current USDA food guide. pyramid suggests 
meat as a healthy source of the daily recommended 
amount of protein. Because of this, some people 
incorrectly believe that in order to get the required 
daily nutritional values, they must eat meat. Howev-
er, protein requirements can easily be met with a care-
fully constructed vegetarian diet. 

"The vegetarian diet pyramid is based on numer-
ous studies showing that the closer you get to a plant-
based diet, the healthier you'll be," says T. Colin 
Campbell, professor of nutritional biochemistry at 
Cornell University. 

However, vegetarians, or anyone who regularly 
skips meat as a part of daily eating habits, must be 
careful to get the proper amount of protein. 

Campbell states that a healthy vegetarian diet 
must include a variety of fruits, vegetables, grains 
and legumes in the form of peanuts, peas and soy 
products. Dairy products such as egg whites and 
milk are also full of protein, but this isn't an accept-
able alternative for vegans - who 
eschew all animal products. Hence, 
vegans must be especially care-
ful to get the proper amounts 
of protein, which can be

Be sure to avoid an excessive amount of sweets, 

refined sugars and simple carbohydrates. 
Fats 

Diet trends like to suggest that the more fat that 
people cut out of their diets, the healthier and happi-
er they will be. However, this isn't necessarily true. 

There are four types of fats. Saturated fats are 
found in red meats, butter, hydrogenated oils, palm 
oil and coconut oil. These have been shown to raise 
the risk of heart disease. 

Monounsaturated fats are found in olive and 
canola oil and have been shown to actually lower 
cholesterol levels when consumed in moderate 
amounts. 

Polyunsaturated fats are found in vegetable oils 
such as com and safflower oil. Although they do not 
seem to raise blood cholesterol levels, increased 
amounts have been shown to increase the risk of cer-
tain forms of cancer. 

Polyunsaturated fats containing omega-3 fatty 
acids from fish oils have been shown to prevent can-
cer and delay cancer development, slow tumor 
growth rates and reduce the size and number of 
tumors. 

According to the USDA, although excess fats coat 
our arteries and playa role in the development of cer-
tain forms of cancers, diabetes and cardiovascular 
disease, fats are a necessary component of a healthy 
diet. 

Fats playa significant role in obesity, contairililg 9 
calories per gram as opposed to carbohydrates and 
proteins, which contain lour calories per gram. 

However, they are nonetheless an important part 
of the daily diet. They assist vitamins A, 0, E and K 
in delivering their nutritional impact as well as giv-
ing food much of its flavors and aromas. 

Currently, federal laws require that food manufac-
turers label their products with the nutritional con-
tent. Although nutrition labels are not required for 
foods like coffee and tea, certain ready-to-eat foods 
like unpackaged deli and bakery items, restaurant 
foods and raw food items from grocery stores, much 
of this nutrition information is available on the 

lntemet, making healthy food choices easier.

Web Editor 

I'll begin this rant by acknowl-
edging an undeniable fact of 
today's consumer world: Busi-
nesses exist to make a profit. 
There is a point, however, when 
corporate ambition must contem-
plate its accountability to con-
sumers - the very people off of 
whom it feeds. 

During a visit to Irvine three 
weeks ago, a friend and I went 
into a Barnes and Noble book-
store with the intent of having cof-
fee and studying. Coffee shops 
and bookstores have become a 
facet of student culture, providing 
young people with an intellectual 
yet social place to work. Recipro-
cally, these establishments benefit 
from the business of students, 
many of whom are repeat cus-
tomers. 

On this occasion, however, an 
atmosphere dedicated to literacy 
and the promotion of student 
patronage was replaced by one of 
greed and blatant discrimination. 

As I unpacked my books at a 
small but accommodating table in 
the comer of the cafe, I was 
approached by a Barnes and 
Noble employee named Su~. Sue 
didn't seem to appreciate the lact 
that I was taking books out of a 
backpack in her cafe. In fact, she 

The UCSD Guardian 

A victim of Barnes and Noble consumerism 
didn't seem to appreciate my 
presence in her cafe at all. 

As I looked over the register 
receipt for the $3.50 latte I 
ordered, Sue stemly asked, "Did 
you hear what I just told that 
group over there?" 

"No," I replied. 
"If you are going to study, you 

can only stay here for one hour. 
I'll be back later to see you out," 
Sue said. 

Thinking this abrupt warning 
could be due to her misconcep-
tion that I wasn't a customer, I 
explained thaI- I just bought a 
latte. ~uch to my surprise, this 
was answered simply by a reitera-
tion: "One hour." 

I sat down at the table and, 
with a profound sense of indigna-
tion, watched as Sue moved 
down the cafe's row of tables, 
barking the same message to 
every group of young patrons 
along the way. 

The businessman at the table 
in front of mine, typing away at 
his laptop didn't receive a single 
word from Sue; neither did the 
family of four sitting to my right. 
A middle-age woman across the 
cafe read her book without inter-
ruption as well. Only young 
adults were put on the clock, has-
sled by employees and ultimately 
asked to leave. 

As my hour came to a close, 
Sue returned and told me it was 
time to wrap things up. I began to 
push for some information on 
Barnes and Noble's new anti-stu-
dent policy. 

Sue, informing me that she 
was the store manager, sa.id that 
she was enforcing a new c0rpo-
rate policy coming straight from 
the top - studying would no 

longer be tolerated in Barnes and 
Noble cates. She said that "No 
Studying Allowed" signs had 
been ordered and would be 
placed in front of the cafe. 

Along with other paying 
Barnes and Noble customers of 
the same age, my friend and I 
were ushered out. 

Patronage or not, it's obvious 
that Barnes and Noble doesn't 
treat its student customers with 
high regard. 

I find the "no studying" policy 
of Barnes and Noble most disturb-
ing when it is reduced to its most 
basic component: age discrimina-
tion. According to the manager, 
only students - apparently inter-
changeable with young adults -
are kicked out of the cafes. 

Nevermind the family that 
was there an hour and a half with-
out purchasing more than a cup of 
coffee, or the businessman who 
remained isolated on his laptop 
computer as we were escorted 
away. ~rdless of who Barnes 
and Noble considers to be more 
valuable customers, a corporate 
policy enforced solely on the basis 
of age constitutes discrimination. 
The businessman was "studying" 
the document on his laptop, and 
the family of four "studied" the 
same magazines lor over an hour 
with no obvious intention to buy. 

The goal of this policy is clear: 
To use a short-si~ted corporate 
decree to attack a group of 
patrons that seems unprofitable to 
its business endeavors. Would 
Barnes and Noble dare make a 
policy against white, middle-age 
men who sit in its cafes for over an 
hour without purchasing more 
than coffee? Hell no. 

In the eres of the corporation, 

customers are converted (as Karl 
~rx once put it) from personal 
worth into exchange value. By 
that equation, students don't add 
up to much. 

Herein ties the great irony. The 
students Barnes and Noble agi-
tates with this policy are actually a 
group of people who are very 
likely to buy: Who has the most 
free time and the test disp0s-
able income? Stu~, plain and 
Simple. 

In an age of increasing e-com-
merce and corporate lnternet 
presence, one wOuld think that a 
bookseller as large as Bames and 
Noble would do its best to avoid 
pissing off those who are most 
likely to. take advantage of online 
purchasing. Because of this new 
policy, I'm sure as hell not going 
to buy from bn.com anytime soon. 

In my mind, aside from the age 
discrimination and clear stupidity 
of this policy, the issue ultimately 
comes down to consumer 
accountability. In a time when lit-
eracy and education are focal 
points of social concern, I find it 
deplorable that Barnes and Noble 
- the nation's No. 1 book retailer 
- is refusing to accommodate 
young adults who have the 
appearance and habits of students 
for the unpardonable, profitless 
err of reading. 

Can we rely on business to 
concern itself in the least with 
important social matters - even 
those directly related to its opera-
tion? Not a chance. 

Can we expect that Barnes and 
Noble will come around and real-
ize the huge demOgraphic against 
which its policy unfairly discrimi-
nates? Not without a fight.

Swann and James Lofton. 

Long was a good defensive 
player for the Raiders and the 84 
S3Cks he garnered are nothing to 
laugh about, but are he and 
Rooney the stuff of greatness? 
Not at aU. 

Long could intimidate and 
tackle, but he couldn't carry a 
team. His 84 sacks don't even 
put him within hailing distance 
of the top five. Surely this cannot 
measure up to par with what the 
Hall is all about. 

Rooney's case is even more 
objectionable. The only reason 
he made it into the Hall was 
because he was at the right place 
at the right time. 

Rooney's only accomplish-
ment was being born; he is the

The third game of the match

night of work for the Tritons. 
Their team attack was the best

Commenting on the strength 

son of Art Rooney, founder and 
owner of the Steelers for many 
years. The steel dty's four cham-
pionships came with dad at the 
helm ofPittaburgh's greatness. 

Son Dan was influential in 
the NFL, but it was by no great 
means other than his pop, who is 
in the HaD of Fame, that he 
receives this honor. 

Furthermore, I think the HaD 
committee really screwed up 
when it omitted two of the best 
wide receivers from its list of 
inductees. 

Steeler Swann only boasts 
four Super Bowl rings for his 
time catching passes from Terry 
Bradshaw. Swann, while racking 
up 364 yards In the four champi-
onships, also took home a Super 
Bowl MVP trophy. 

Lofton also played in four 
Super Bowls despite coming up 
on the short end of the stick In all 
of them. Lofton was the first 
NFL player to score touchdowns 
in tI\ree different decades and 

of this liiton team in compari-
son to past years' teams, UCSD 
alumni Dan Thomassen 
described it as "smaller but 
quicker." Thomassen also noted 
Hove's performance. 

"Jordan appears to be the 
most athletic setter they've had 
in a while." 

Athleticism and quickness 
definitely proved to outweigh 
physical size In game three, as 
l1CSD did more of the same as it 
began to pull away and show that 
it was cle8rly the better team. 

The UCSD Guardian 

caught 764 passes (eighth best) 
for 14,004 yards (second all-time 
only to Jerry Rice). He also 
scored 75 touchdowns in 16 sea-
sons with five teams. 

Levy also deserves to have the 
honor of induction bestowed 
upon him. This. head coach led 
the Bibs to four straight Super 
Bowls, though they lost all of 
them. These days, getting to just 
one Super Bowl takes a heck of a 
coaching job - making it to four 
in a row is an outstanding feat 
that can only be done with supe-
rior leadership at the head coach-
ing position. His accomplish-
ments speak for themselves. 

Hopefully Levy, Lofton and 
Swann will be elected into the 
elite club with next year's vote. 
U not, they still have plenty of 
time to get in, but Swann's time 
of eli~i1ity is running out. He 
may nave to take the Wilcox 
route to be honored, which 
would be inappropriate for a 
person of Swann's stature. 

"We've been executing better 
in the last two games," Head 
Coach Ron Larsen said. "That 
happens as the season ProgJesees. 
Guys are coming in and we're fig-
uring out what we need to do." 

DespHe their record, the 
liitons have been doing what 
they need to do against Division 
ill opponents. U they continue in 
this . fashion, a toumament bid 
could be in their future. 

The liitons will travel north 
to Westwood to face UCLA on 
Friday Feb. 11.

Fulton 
Corner Volleyball Slugs Santa Cruz 
Robert Funon 
Hall of Fame should 
reconsider choices 

The National Football 
League's recent announce-
ment of the newest members 
to be inducted into its Hall of 
Fame on July 29 in Canton, 
Ohio has raised some serious 
questions about its selection 
process. 

The new inductees, chosen 
by a selection committee of 38 
writers and broadcasters, 
include Joe Montana, Ronnie 
Lott, Howie Long, Dan 
Rooney and Dave Wikox. 

Tbe list does sport some 
no-brainers, the most obvious 
being Montana, the leg-
endary quarterback who 
played for the San Francisco 
4gers before wrapping his 
career up with the Kansas 
City Chiefs. 

A discussion of who is the 
best QB of all time cannot take 
place without Montana's 
name coming up. In my opin-
ion, he is the best player to 
ever take snaps from a center 
- and only Johnny Unitas 
could possibly challenge that 
honor. His leadership abilities 
and coolness in tough situa-
tions are unmatched by any 
other player. 

Montana's accomplish-
ments include four Super 
Bowl rings with three Super 
Bowl MVP awards to boot. [n 
his 122 Super Bowl lass 
attempts, he complete 68 
percent while never throwing 
an interception. He holds five 
Super Bowl records including 
11 touchdown passes and 
1,142 career passing yards. 
His 357 yards passing in 
Super Bowl xxrr was only 
surpassed by Kurt Warner's 
recen t effo rt . 

Montana finished his career 
with 3,409 completions, the 
third best record in NFL hist~ 
ry. He tossed 273 touchdown 
passes and threw for 40,511 
yards, both ranking sixth all 
time. 

The second inductee that 
didn't bring much debate is 
Lott. He too is a gimmee, 
being the defensive corner-
stone of the 4gers champi-
onships in the '80s. He played 
both the cornerback and safe-
ty positions with the Niners 
before bouncing around to the 
Raiders and the Jets at the end 
of his career. 

His other accomplish-
ments include holding the 
NFL post-season record with 
9 interceptions, recording 
100-plus tackles five times in 
a 14-year career and picking 
off the opposing quarterback 
63 times for fifth best of all-
time. 

A third inductee into the 
hall is Wilcox, who eamed the 
honor as an old-timer nomi-
nee after going to seven Pro 
Bowls with the 4gers from 
1964-1974. 

The gripe I have with the 
choices of the selection com-
mittee is due to the inclusion 
of Howie Long and Dan 
Rooney and the omission of 
greats Marv Levy, Lynn

STREAK: The Tritons make quick work of the 
Banana Slugs for their second straight victory 
By BRIAN WELLES 
Associate Sports Editor 

As Triton Raffi Mititian 
worked though diving drills dur-
ing the break between Saturday 
night's matches, fans could clear-
ly see that the UCSD men's vol-
leyball team was ready to win. 
The Tritons' hustling was a con-
stant throughout the game 
against the UC Santa Cruz 
Banana Slugs - the 
Tritons took the 
game 15-9, 15-11, 
15-6. 

With the 
exception of some sloppy 
moves at the start of the first 
game, UCSD played with intensi-
ty while fully utilizing its range of 
talent. Game one was arguably 
the Tritons' most solid and well-
played match of the year -
everything seemed to be clicking, 
and for 90 minutes the fans at 
RIMAC received a Saturday night 
treat. 

"We passed well and sided out 
well," opposite Donald Chen 
said, who led with 19 kills. "Day 
by day, we' re getting better and 
better at our game, and we've 
been working a lot better as a 
team." 

The only threat the Tritons 
faced was the play of Banana 
Slugs Mike Rubin and Peter 
Butler. The opposition's outside 
hitters teamed up for 30 of 
UCSC's 37 kills, at times holding 
the Triton attack at a complete 
standstill . 

Midway through the game, 
UCSC's Mike Rubin provided a 
block and scored a point to make 
it 7-3, Slugs. 

Soon the Tritons stopped play-
ing as if the volleyban was lop-
sided, as Zac.k Hite and Chen 
leading the Triton comeback 
attack. 

Chen blocked a UCSC attack 
and the Tritons regained the lead, 
9-8. UCSD marched away with 
the game after some more fantas-
tic blocking. Earnest Yun also 
contributed to the Triton rally 
with some key blocks and digs. 

With the Tritons up 14-9, the 
Santa Cruz attack fell apart. 
When a UCSC attack fell wide, 

the Tritons took the game and 
capped a 13-3 run. 

Despite the Tritons' 
scoring streak, 
Santa Cruz 
turned the con-
test into a dog 

fight in the second game. 
, A seesaw affair began to 

take place, with Peter Butler 
spearheading the Banana Slug 
charge on the far side of the net. 
He won a few blocking battles 
against Chen and UCSC led 7-6. 
Butler also helped lead the way 
with 8 kills. 

Hite later gave the Tritons an 
8-7 lead when he hit the ball on 
the near side to bring it down 

. against Santa Cruz. Butler came 
back wiTh a tip into the Tritons' 
court to tie the game at eight. 

Jordan Hove then stepped up 
his game and became the man for 
UCSD; Hove's. criUcal kill 
brought the score to 9-8, Tritons. 
Hove then followed with two 
blocks in a row on the far side, 
silencing Butler's game ami gIV-
ing fans a chance to roar. 

The Tritons extended their 
lead to 12-9, but Butler hit a cross-
court kill and Rubin slashed one 
down the middle to cut the lead 
to 12-11. 

An illegal contact call fol-
lowed by a back row violation 
gave the Tritons two more 
points. After Yun blocked one on 
the far side, the blue and gold

Basketball's Winning Streak Ends at Nine 
LOSS: Poor free-throw shooting does in the Tritons and ends their impressive win streak 
By ROBERT RJLTON 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD women's basket-
ball team's nine-game winning 
streak came to a startling halt 
while on the road Saturday as the 
Tritons finished on the losing end 
of a game for the first time in 
nearly two months, falling to 
Patten 79-66 

"It wasn't a bad game," Triton 
Head Coach Judy Malone said. 
"We just couldn't hit in the first 
five minutes." 

Height was the main advan-
tage for Patten, as it has players 
as tall as 6'3" as well as some pre-
vious members of the Lithuanian 
Olympic Team. 

The Tritons could not over-
come a horrible first half in which 
they were outscored 40-26. They 
shot only 31 percent in the first 
period iA · comparison to the 
Lions' 50 percent shooting . 

UCSD also only shot 33 per-
cent from behind the three-point 
arch. Combined with the Lions' 
free-throw shooting, which was 
almost perfect on the night, 
Patten did the Tritons in. 

UCSD did pick it up in the sec-
ond half, outscoring the home 
team 40-39, but it was too little 
too late. 

The Tritons shot almost 50 per-
cent from the field, but it was not 
enough to get a win as the Lions 
were clutch where it counted 
most, hitting 14 of 15 foul 
shots while 
UCSD only 
connected on 
12 of 21. 

UCSD was 
led by two of its bench 
players: Nicolle Bromley 
scored 12 points and pulled 
down four rebounds while 
Kimberly Neal, who just came 
back from an ankle injury, put in 
12 paints and grabbed five 
rebounds. 

"She's back but not 100 per-
cent," Malone said of Neal. 

The leadin.K starter for UCSD 
was Mindy Mlsawa, who scored 
seven. Teammate Natalie Beaver 
added nine from the bench. 

The hosts had a number of big-
time players with four women 
grabbing double-digit figures: 
Vilma Tamulevidute put in 25 

points to lead all scorers and also that." 
had seven assists. Malone had nothing but praise 

"She was a good player," for the Lions. 
Malone said. "'If you stopped "They are a good team," 
her, she would just dish it off Malone said. "They started out 
and we couldn't stop (her team- the season slow. They didn't
