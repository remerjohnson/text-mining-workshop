Members of the Muslim Student 
Association have received anonymous 
hate e-mails and threatening phone 
calls in response to the 11th-annual 
Islam Awareness Week. Posters for the 
event have also been defaced. 

MSA Vice President External 
Eyad Alnaslah said MSA members 
occasionally receives e-mails and calls 
throughout the year, but there was a 
large influx once the flyers were posted 
around campus.

Members reported the defaced 
posters and e-mails to the Office for 
the Prevention of Harassment and 
Discrimination — which opened on 
Feb. 1 — in a bias incident report form.

According to Alnaslah, MSA was 
told not to worry by OPHD Associate 
Director Carol Leah Rogers, and that 
OPHD would keep an eye on their 
events. At this week’s event from Feb. 
14 to 18, a security guard was present.

On the first day of Islam Awareness 
Week, Alnaslah said there were many 
more evangelical Christians than usual 
with picket signs defaming Islam on 

The UCSD Library Committee has outlined a plan to close the CLICS Library for the 2011-12 
academic year as part of a $3 million 
budget cut to the libraries.

“The only we way would be able to 
absorb a cut the size of $3 million is to 
close our smaller libraries’ facilities,” 
university librarian Brian Schottlaender 
said.

The cut is part of the UCSD’s budget 
cut of $60 million — based on Gov. 
Jerry Brown’s proposed $500 million 
budget reduction to the UC system. 
The library was originally asked by the 
Campus Budget Office to cut $6 million 
but the committee said it could only 
take a $3 million cut. 

The closure of CLICS alone would 
save $450,000 next year. 

“We are still in the planning stages 
and don’t expect a final budget until June 
or later,” Libraries’ Communications 
Director Dolores Davies said. “[But] 
we could conceivably start closing the 
libraries slated for closure as soon as 
this summer.”

CLICS is not the only library on 
campus in danger of being shut down. 
The Medical Center Library, Science 
& Engineering Library and Scripps 
Library will also be closed. The clo-

sure of these three libraries would save  
$645,000. 

“We simply can’t continue to absorb 
additional reductions of this magnitude 
without consolidating and closing some 
of our facilities,” Davies said. “There is 
just no reasonable alternative.”

Select collections and services from 
these libraries would be consolidated 
into the Biomedical Library, while col-
lections from the International Relations 
and Pacific Studies Library would be 
merged with Geisel Library, forming 
a single Social Sciences & Humanities 
Library (and saving  $345,000).

Last year, Sixth College senior and 
then-A.S. President Utsav Gupta sought 
funding solutions for maintaining 
library services, but little came of the 
efforts.

“It was an inside conversation of 
whether or not there would be any 
willingness,” Gupta said. “There was 
no answer to that. I didn’t really push 
it forward.”

Despite last year’s lack of progress 
concerning libraries, Gupta said he sup-
ports prioritizing the libraries.

University of California Student 
Association and UC student leaders across 
California are campaigning for Assembly 
Bills 130 and 131, which allow undocumented 
students to apply for financial aid while 
applying for or attending state schools. 
UCSA is urging all campuses to appeal to 
Gov. Jerry Brown so that the bills — also 
known as the California Development, Relief 
and Education for Alien Minors Act — are 
signed into law. 

“The D.R.E.A.M. Act would benefit 
our campus by allowing accessibility and 
affordability in the UC system and by 
allowing students to apply for the financial 
aid they’re already contributing to,” Sixth 
College Senator Kristian Castro said.

Castro is involved in the UCSA campaign 
through a resolution that would educate and 
garner support for the D.R.E.A.M. Act. 

Authored by State Assemblyman Gil 
Cedillo (D-Los Angeles), the D.R.E.A.M. 
Act would go into effect July 1 this year, if 
passed. The bill would allow undocumented 
students to apply for financial aid from a 
private pool of money while they apply for or

Campaign for

To bring 50 electric cars and 50 charging 
stations to UCSD, the Jacobs School of Engineering 
is teaming up with the City of San Diego, San Diego 
Gas & Electric, GE and CleanTECH San Diego 
to launch Smart City San Diego, an organization 
which will bring sustainable clean energy initiatives 
to the San Diego region. 

The organization’s first step is a study on electric 
vehicle use at UCSD’s campus.

UCSD Strategic Initiatives Director Byron 
Washom said the idea for the study originated from 
a suggestion to use renewable solar cells on campus, 
like those on the top of Hopkins Parking Structure, 
to charge the vehicles. 

“When [solar cells] are used to charge electric 
vehicles, there are zero tailpipe emissions, unlike 
the result when electric vehicles are charged at 
home,” Washom said.      

The concept developed into a goal to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions and advanced into Smart 
City San Diego as a collaborative effort to expand 
alternative energy use.  

Starting in September, students, faculty and 
staff members can lease electric vehicles for as 
long as three years. Prospective drivers must be 
at least 18 years old, have a favorable credit rating 
(or someone to co-sign the lease) and proof of 
insurance.  

Fifty drivers will be selected from a questionnaire 
focusing on demographics and driving patterns to 
ensure a variety of participants. After the pool 

of qualified participants is selected starting in 
September, participants’ names will be provided to 
a commercial leasing company that will disperse 
the vehicles immediately. 

“We anticipate that we will have more than 
50 ideal participants,” Washom said.   “The final 
selection will likely be as simple as blindly picking 
names out of a hat.”

Smart City San Diego will work with an 
undetermined professor in the social sciences 
division to create a profile that will study 
mainstream consumer behavior to understand 
their decisions and to identify other possible 
electric vehicle initiatives.  

The profile will assess variations in commute

Findings May Control Invasive Argentine Ants in Calif.
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

By Sarah Kang
Staff Writer

Since the Argentine ant arrived 
in California in 1907, the species has 
spread from the southern tip of the 
Mexico border to San Francisco. The 
L. humile — a foreign invasive species 
that kills off native ants in the regions it 
invades — has become a common pest 
control problem, disrupted populations 
of lizards and shifted the ecosystem of 
coastal California. 

“One thing that we’ve done is to try 
to understand why the Argentine ant 
invades some natural areas in San Diego 
and not others,” associate professor 
in the ecology and neuroscience 
department David Holway said. “One 
thing that we’ve noticed is that the 
abundance of the Argentine ants is 
positively correlated with soil moisture. 
They tend to be very common in 
irrigated areas, urban environments 
[and] some agricultural areas.”

Experimentation, physiological 
work and environmental mesh 
modeling, which uses geographical 

information systems, show that the 
Argentine ant’s ability to invade natural 
environments in San Diego depends on 
the physical environment’s suitability.

Holway has been studying 
Argentine ants to find what factors 
cause invasion in certain areas, how 
they compete with and replace native 
species, how they affect the ecosystem 
after displacing native species. The 
search has an emphasis on how the 
ants contribute to the ecosystem.

Citrus farmers in California are 
using increasingly large quantities 
of pesticides against the Argentine 
ants, which mutually exchanges food 
with ants that produce honeydew. 
The increase in pesticides affects 
the produce and also could causes 
evolutionary changes in the targeted 
species of insects and aphids. 

“One example of an indirect effect 
of that invasion is what happened to the 
horned lizard,” Holway said. “Namely, 
the horned lizards eat large-bodied 
native ant species — those are killed 
off by the Argentine ant, and when 
the Argentine ant invades and kills off 

harvester ants, the horned lizards don’t 
have anything to eat.”

The barrel cactus, local to the San 
Diego coast, has been similarly affected. 
The cactus feeds by trapping ants, 
luring them with nectar. The trapped 
ants also ward off herbivores from 
eating the cactus. Argentine ants have 
killed off the local ant species, making 
the cactus vulnerable to predation.

UC Berkeley ecology and 
evolutionary professor Neil Tsutsui 
sequenced the genome of L. humile, 
and discovered that the ant species 
can recognize and process various 
chemical signals due to their large 
number of chemical receptor genes. By 
understanding the chemical messages 
they send and receive, researchers may 
be able find other ways to thwart the 
destructive patterns of the ants. 

Holway said an eradication of the 
Argentine ant is impossible. Because 
Southern California is irrigating in 
many areas, regions that have naturally 
dry soil become perfect habitats for the 
moist soil-loving Argentine ant. Efforts 
to decrease water usage will not only 

decrease the density of the ants, but will 
also help in conserving water.

Areas that practice water 
conservation seem to have fewer 
problems involving the Argentine ant 
compared to places that have not cut 
down on water usage. 

Holway said places like the Torrey 
Pines State Park and at Cabrillo National 
Monument, have taken measures in 
their gardens and in their visitor centers 
by using less water than they did before.

Library Walk.
Alnaslah said the posters were 

defaced with phrases such as “We love 
Jesus (Peace be Upon Him),” “We love 
the killing of Jews” and “Women wear 
bombs on their head.” 

“In regard to the defaced fliers and 
the hate e-mails, they only show a 
small microcosm of what’s happening 
around the United States on a larger 
scale,” Alnaslah said.

The e-mails and phone calls have 
targeted the MSA in general, not the 

group’s awareness week. According 
to Alnaslah, common sentiments 
expressed were “Fuck Muslims” and 
“You are terrorists and blood killers.”

“It’s fabricated rhetoric,” 

mission of the university,” Gupta said. 
“Residence halls and study halls don’t 
have an environment that is condusive 
to higher learning, which a library has.”

Campus Budget Office Assistant 
Vice Chancellor Sylvia Lepe-Askari 
said the $60 million cut estimate is 
based on the fact that UCSD comprises 
about 12 percent of the UC system.  

“No decisions have been made to 
simply make cuts [right now],” Lepe-
Askari said. “If you look at the system-
wide total budget and look at the pro-
portional share of the individual cam-
puses, that’s a basic proxy we typically 
use to allow us to plan [a budget cut].”

Lepe-Askari said the university is 
looking at other alternatives to address 
the budget cuts, like grants and bonds.

The books that are currently in 
CLICS would be returned to the com-
pany they were rented from. The com-
puters, on the other hand, would be 
moved to other parts of campus. 

“The library is not only a symbolic, 
but also a very practical, place for stu-
dents to study,” Sixth College Senator 
Parminder Sandhu said. “Closing the 
library should be a last resort and 
something that really is kind of in the 
unfathomable, because we’re an institu-
tion of higher learning and the libraries 
are where people study, where they 
learn, where they access resources, both 
tangible and non-tangible.”

Additional disagreements to the 
closures has been stated by other A.S. 
councilmembers.

“A lot of students rely on [CLICS] 
for finals week, because it’s open 24/7 

— Geisel barely stays open until 12,” 
Campuswide Senator and Library 
Committee member Anish Bhayani 
said. “And so we’re looking at a huge 
impact to UCSD students in terms 
of the library options that they have 
and the hours that they can utilize the 
library for studying.”

For the last three years, the librar-
ies, which depend on state funding for 
nearly 85 percent of their budget, have 
suffered from budget cuts of $5 million, 
or 16 percent, of their total budget.

“[So far we’ve managed the budget 
with] all kinds of cost-cutting around 
the edges — so we’ve shortened library 
hours, consolidated service points and 
reduced information expenditures and 
we’ve eliminated a bunch of positions,” 
Schottlaender said.

He said reductions have become 
increasingly difficult to deal with.

“If we’re asked to take another $3 
million cut the next fiscal year, on 
top of all the cuts we’ve already made, 
we will not be able to do that by cut-
ting around the edges, because there 
are no more edges to cut around,” 
Schottlaender said.

With the state budget plan, UC 
Berkeley will cut $80.8 million while 
UCLA will face the largest budget cut 
at $96 million.

“Berkeley and Los Angeles, for 
example, will be different, because 
they’re certainly much more senior and 
larger campuses.”

The Library Committee meeting 
is scheduled for March 5, after Acting 
Senior Vice Chancellor of Academic 
Affairs Suresh Subramani reviews how 

other departments are absorbing cuts.
UCSD Budget Office Assistant 

Director Blair Stephenson said it is too 
early to tell how the $60 million cut will 
affect other areas of campus.

“The whole campus is planning 
cuts, but there’s nothing that has been 
identified on where the cuts are going 
to be,” Stephenson said. “It’s more of a 
potential response to the cut, but the 
campus hasn’t even allocated how the 
$60 million would be distributed across 
the campus — we’re so early in the 
planning stages right now.”

Stephenson said his office is exam-
ining the impact of previous cuts. 

“We knew this year would 
be worse than the previous year,” 
Stephenson said. “The budget office 
is now getting a sense of what that 
would look like and campus lead-
ership is looking at how they can 
address the budget crisis.”

He said he is concerned about the 
7-percent fee increase that may take 
place next year, based on a legislative 
analysis published by the Sacramento 
Bee in a Feb. 14 blog post.

“If budget cuts grow, there may 
be a seven percent fee increase,” 
Stephenson said. “That’s one of our 
greatest fears right now. Students will 
be impacted [and] we may have less 
faculty, less TAs, higher fees — any 
scenario you can think of is a pos-
sibility.”

Tensions ran high last night over 
a proposed resolution in support of 
banning steam machines used by 
the Housing, Dining and Hospitality 
department. 

Council made 
two amendments 
to the resolution, 
striking two clauses 
that contained 
factual errors. 
HDH is already in 
talks to consider 
fixing this problem; 
several councilmembers did not want 
to ruin chances of negotiations before 
the process even began.

Sixth College Senator Parminder 
Sandhu supported the goal of the 
resolution but said it needs a lot of 
revision. President Wafa Ben Hassine 
encouraged councilmembers to pass 
the resolution today and to make 
amendments quickly. Campuswide 
Senator Michael Raimondi warned 
that this is an issue that should not be 
treated lightly. He encouraged council 
to discuss the conflict instead of 
passing a rushed resolution.

Campuswide Senator Victor 
Flores-Osorio encouraged members 
not to listen to the administrators 
who believe the problems are not 
a big deal. He said service workers 
who use the machines are pleading 
for help. AVP of Local Affairs 
Matthew Vu added that council 
should uphold the Principles of 
Community and look out for 
the workers. He ended by saying 
the council needs to keep the 
administration in check instead of 
letting it check them. Discussion 
was postponed so other speakers 
could present, though ultimately the 
resolution passed.

Shanna Dayan and Sarah 
Raifsnider from the Office of Student 
Wellness proposed two resolutions 

regarding the current on-campus 
smoking policy. The first one — 
designating smoking areas in parking 
lots — was passed, while the other, 
transitioning to a smoke-free campus, 

was not.
Campuswide 

Senator Elizabeth 
Elman brought the 
first smoking ban 
policy resolution 
up in new business. 
Discussion 
ranged from 

personal freedoms to the dangers of 
secondhand smoke. 

The University Centers fee 
proposal was amended — several 
changes were made to the wording — 
and was approved without discussion. 
It will appear on Spring Quarter’s A.S. 
election ballot.

Campuswide Senator Anish 
Bhayani presented the updated 
Athletics Recreation and Sports 
Facilities Advisory Board charter 
changes. Two of the changes Bhayani 
proposed to ARSFAB were accepted. 
The advisory board will now have the 
power to make decisions rather than 
just recommending changes. If the 
board director does not implement 
the changes, ARSFAB can go to the 
Chancellor to mediate and the director 
will provide a written reason for 
rejecting the proposed change to the 
board. Council approved the updates.

This was the longest council 
meeting of quarter. It started an 
hour early at 5 p.m., had a recess for 
nearly two hours so councilmembers 
could attend a Tim Wise lecture 
and ended at 10:20 p.m. The steam 
machine resolution arguments 
pulled the weight of the meeting. As 
the end drew near, members quietly 
streamed out of the meeting and 
right before the final role call there 
was a mad rush to pack up and leave.

When news leaked over the weekend that President Obama’s budget pro-posal for next year cut $100 billion 
from Pell Grants (aka federal scholarships), we 
were surprised: Wasn’t this coming from the same 
president who regularly touts the importance of 
investing in education — the same president who, 
just last year, increased the maximum grant by 
$800 to $5,550? 

The short answer is yes. But the longer answer 
must consider that the Pell Grant Program, thanks 
in large part to last year’s introduction of addi-
tional grants for summer school students, has 
grown tremendously — so much so that, accord-
ing to the administration, it faces a $20 billion 
deficit for next year. 

Cutting aid for summer classes is estimated to 
save about $8 billion starting in the 2012-13 aca-
demic year and around $60 billion over the next 
decade. The other major change Obama has pro-
pose is reducing loan subsidies to grad-school and 
professional students, who now don’t pay inter-
est on their loans as long they’re still in school. 
Would free up about another $30 billion over the 
next decade. 

In light of the kind of take-few-prisoners bud-

get-slashing expected — partly to slow the growth 
of the national deficit, and partly in an effort to 
move further toward the political right before 
next year’s election — higher education spend-
ing could certainly have fared worse in Obama’s 
proposal. 

In contrast, the Republican response this week 
reduces the maximum Pell Grant to $4,705, or 
about 15 percent of what it is now — and for this 
upcoming academic year, not the year after, as 
Obama suggested. Even deeper cuts, under the 
GOP proposal, should be expected to follow. 

But we still can’t help but bristle at the pros-
pect of such extensive, long-term cuts to the 
system. Pell Grants affect roughly the bottom half 
of the income bracket; according to most recent 
data from the UC Office of the President (from 
2008-09), fully 93 percent of freshmen with family 
incomes under $48,000 benefit from the program.

Capitol officials are quick to point out that 
there’s little evidence that summer aid has helped 
speed up graduation rates across the country — 
but given that it’s such a new incentive, there’s also 
no evidence that it doesn’t. 

If immediate changes to the system are neces-
sary, which they likely are, this board would prefer 

to see the more grants tied to concrete academic 
progress: extending grants only to those on track 
to graduate in less than five years, or to those who 
maintain a minimum GPA are two possibilities. 
Both would be fairer tests of trimming the fat, and 
both would preserve Obama’s campaign goal of 
offering a college education to every student that 
wants and is willing to work hard for one.

exactly my (or anyone’s) cup of tea.

Despite doing twice as much as 
I do now, I still managed to wake 
up at 6 a.m., pick out my outfit, 
change my mind, pick something 
else out and then spend half an hour 
straightening my hair and doing my 
makeup. 

Two years later, I’m lucky if the 
clothes I’m wearing off the floor 
don’t smell like bird feed.

You’d think that I would have 
more than enough time to keep up 
my appearance. But you’d be wrong. 
Somehow, despite the fact that I’m 
doing less and sleeping more, I still 
can’t manage to dress myself in a way 
that would have been even remotely 
acceptable to the high-school me. 

With midterms and papers nearly 
every week, I feel completely justi-
fied wearing sweats — or, on classier 
days, yoga pants — to school.

My appearance hit an all-time 
low when I was leaving Ralph’s with 
a shopping cart and the security 
guard stopped me.

“Excuse me, ma’am, but you can’t 
leave the store with that cart.”

“Why not?”
“It’s for in-store use only — not 

personal use.”
“Personal use? I’m just taking it 

to my car.”
“We’ve had an increase of your 

kind using these carts to store their 
personal belongings. I’m sorry, but I 
can’t let you leave with it.”

I knew that I wasn’t dressed to 
the nines or anything, but I didn’t 
think I looked homeless. Apparently, 
I was wrong.

That was a wake-up call. It, in 
combination with my friend step-
ping on my glasses, made for the 
perfect opportunity to get my shit 
together. 

It was like a scene out of the 
“Princess Diaries.” I shoved my col-
lection of Marshall College T-shirts 
and UCSD sweatpants to the back 
of the closet and started picking 
through hundreds of dollars worth 
of the Forever 21 clothes I accumu-
lated during my brief stint there over 
the summer. 

After doing a once-over of my 
wardrobe, I decided to lay some very 
simple ground rules for myself:

1. Sweats and yoga pants are for 
working out, not for being seen in 
public. 

2. Make-up is your friend. 
3. Hair should never resemble 

Courtney Love’s.
The first few days were a suc-

cess. Spending an extra 20 minutes 
on my appearance resulted in waves 
of compliments from my friends 
and coworkers. Maybe it’s sad that I 
was being praised for looking “nor-
mal” — something that never would 
have happened in high school, with 
all my outfits that were finished off 
with matching metals and perfectly 
coiffed hair, but for now, I’ll take 
what I can get.

A Change of 
Pace

When budget cuts hit hard, eVerYOne has tO MaKe sacriFices. but at a tOp research 
uniVersitY, cLOsing Libraries shOuLd be the VerY Last resOrt.

Lights Out

We’ve protested. We’ve hosted days of action. We’ve attended teach-ins. But when all is said and done, none of 
them have stopped ever-increasing budget cuts, 
which could hit UCSD in a big way next year, 
with the closure of CLICS. That’s right — we 
have sunk to such financial depths that UCSD, 
one of the country’s top research facilities, is 
closing a library.

Before angry students start protesting 
outside Head Librarian Brian Schottlaender’s 
office, keep in mind that this drastic measure 
is the result of a top-down process. Gov. Jerry 
Brown’s budget takes $500 million from the UC 
campuses, and now all the campuses are being 
asked to take cuts in proportion to their size. 
UC Berkeley will be cutting $80 million, while 
UCLA administrators are trying to find areas in 
which to save $96 million.

Our shoulder of the burden peaks at $60 
million, which means administrators have man-
dated that the libraries cut $6 million by next 
year. Thankfully, Schottlaender has bargained 
that into a $3-million cut, but he says that in 

order to make any dent in that number, CLICS 
needs to go. And while shutting down our favor-
ite 24-hour finals week study spot would save us 
$450,000, the gain isn’t worth the loss of a study 
space, the books in it (which would have to be 
returned to the company they’re rented from) 
and one of the symbolic pillars of our university. 

CLICS won’t be the only library affected. 
Other victims include the Medical Center 
Library, Science & Engineering Library and 
Scripps Libraries, whose collections will likely 
be consolidated into the Biomedical Library. 
Similarly, Geisel’s Science & Humanities Library 
would absorb some collections from the 
International Relations/Pacific Studies Library. 

It’s a grim outlook, but at this point there’s 
not much else Schottlaender or other members 
of the Library Committee can do against their 
orders to cut costs. 

Our libraries depend on state funding for 
the majority of their budget, and have already 
had their funding cut by $5 million in the past 
three years. This has led to positions being cut, 
and the shortened library hours we all know and 

love. As Schottlaender himself says, they can’t 
cut around the edges anymore. If this goes on, 
soon there won’t be anything left to cut. 

The libraries must be prioritized when 
determining the amount each department must 
cut. While all departments are important, the 
libraries are both a practical and symbolic need 
on campus, and are a crucial tool to further our 
educations. 

And if (in the very likely case) that the 
library finds at its March 5 meeting that the $3 
million cuts are written in stone, it might be 
time for students to cough up some of our own 
money to keep the library open. 

The idea that our tuition is rising and yet we 
would need to pay student fees — which should 
go toward student life activities and not academ-
ic ones — to keep libraries open is a ludicrous 
one. But it may be the only way that we can 
show that we prioritize our education and need 
CLICS kept open.

oPINIoN THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 2011 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 5 

said he was looking into a similar 
student fee referendum that would 
ask students to fund increased 
library hours. This refer-
endum was never seriously 
discussed in council.

It’s true that a library 
referendum would open 
an entirely new can of 
worms; after all, it would 
be the first time student 
fees have gone to help out 
a UCSD department. 

The issue has been 
brought up before, when 
Transportation Parking 
Director Brian d’Autremont’s asked 
for student money to help save 
the shuttles. One of the major 

arguments against it was the ever-
ubiquitous fear of a slippery slope: 
First the transportation depart-
ment, next Student Health Services 

and before you 
know it, half the 
university depart-
ments are lining up 
at council with an 
outstretched hand. 

These concerns 
are still valid, but 
this may be the 
cause that warrants 
such a break from 
tradition. 

Of course we 
should all keep asking Sacramento 
to return funding to the UC sys-
tem, but in the meantime, there 

are some pretty difficult decisions 
to make. It’s dejecting to shoulder 
more and more of our base cost of 
education, but if there is a library 
referendum on this April’s ballot, 
and the alternative is fewer hours, 
closed libraries and  less resources, 
students should show with their 
money that they prioritize their 
education. 

Unlike students paying for con-
certs at the Loft to stay free, or the 
recently re-introduced University 
Centers referendum — that would 
have students paying to keep 
Price Center open 24 hours — the 
library referendum would not go 
toward student-life luxuries, but 
sustaining the academic needs of 
our students.

Dear Editor,
Both Orange County District 

Attorney Tony Rackauckas and Erwin 
Chemerinsky, dean of UC Irvine’s 
law school, should be disbarred; the 
American Bar Association should 
also postpone approval of the UCI 
Law School pending Chemerinsky’s 
disbarment and dismissal.

A dozen rabbis from across the 
USA have condemned the prosecu-
tion of eight students from UC Irvine 
and three from UC Riverside — all 
members of the Muslim Student 
Union — who temporarily squelched 
Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren’s 
Feb. 8, 2011 talk to the Southern 
California campus community.

Mario Savio’s “bodies upon 
the gears” speech on Dec. 2, 1964 
attacked well-meaning liberals, as did 
Martin Luther King Jr.’s “Letter From 
Birmingham Jail.” The wide-ranging 
precedents for the action of the 
Muslim Student Union also include 
Albert Camus’s existential gesture of 
self-identification (acte gratuit) and 
UCSD Professor Herbert Marcuse’s 
concept of repressive tolerance.

Free debate is a commonplace 
in ABA circles, probably because 
lawyers are accustomed to opposing 
each other in their daily work lives, 
also because lawyers have sufficient 
leisure for political campaigns (over 
the span of the Seventy-first to the 
Seventy-fifth Congress, between 61 

and 76 percent of U.S. senators were 
lawyers).

In the mid-twentieth century, 
the Archdiocese of San Francisco 
sponsored the St. Thomas More 
Society, a guild of lawyers. The 
Jewish Decalogue Society of Chicago 
Lawyers was founded in 1934.  

The preponderance of lawyers 
in New York City were Jews — as of 
1963, 61 percent — and 70 percent 
of these were Eastern European in 
origin.

During the Free Speech 
Movement at UC Berkeley (in which 
I played an exceedingly minor role), 
UC President Clark Kerr warned that 
while the regents had demonstrated 
“great patience with temporary viola-
tion of public conduct, this patience is 
not infinite” (San Francisco Chronicle, 
Nov. 11, 1964). Outside the regents 
meeting held in University Hall on 
Nov. 20, 1964, Joan Baez sang:  “Let’s 
not have a sniffle/Let’s have a bloody 
good cry.”

attend college. 
To be eligible, applicants must have entered 

the U.S. before age 16, must have lived in the 
U.S. for at least five years and must have a 
high school diploma. Applicants must also be 
between the ages of 12 and 35 when applying.

Administered by state colleges and 
universities, Return to Aid is a fund that 
provides institutional and university grants 
that undocumented students pay into through 
student fees, but from which they cannot 
receive aid. While these students are currently 
eligible for in-state tuition under AB540, 
they are not allowed access to institutional 
financial aid or state grants.  

During the Jan. 18-20 UC Board of 
Regents meeting, UCSA President and UC 
Santa Cruz junior Claudia Magaña requested 
that the regents sign a letter to Brown in 
support of the D.R.E.A.M. Act. Nine of the 
26 board members signed it at the meeting.

“We need the regents’ support today for 
the D.R.E.A.M. Act,” Magaña said in a press 
statement on Jan. 24. “While President [Mark 
G.] Yudof has supported the D.R.E.A.M. 
Act publicly, he is not the only member of 
the board. Students want to see more than 
sympathy from the regents; they want to see 
leadership.” 

Magaña also expressed concern over the 
$500 million cut to the UC system under 

Brown’s proposed budget.
“Every campus leader, every department, 

every auxiliary and service must face the 
challenges that lie ahead while protecting 
affordability and the services that retain and 
support our students,” she said. 

UCSA has called for all undergraduate 
campuses to participate in the campaign by 
collecting postcards addressed to Brown in 
support of the D.R.E.A.M. Act. The postcards 
collected from these UC campuses will be 
delivered to the governor’s office at the annual 
UCSA Lobby Day on Feb. 28. 

A resolution in favor of the act was 
presented to and passed by A.S. Council 
on Feb. 8. The resolution, authored by Vice 
President of External Affairs Michael Lam, 
Campus Organizing Director Chevelle 
Newell and Castro, establishes the council’s 
full support of the California D.R.E.A.M. Act.

The resolution presented to council said 
that AB540 individuals at UCSD are part 
of the student community and emphasized 
UCSA’s belief in affordable and accessible 
education. 

AB540 individuals are exempt from 
paying out-of-state tuition under Assembly 
Bill 540, legislation passed in 2001 that allows 
undocumented students to pay in-state 
fees at a California community college, 
state university or UC campus, provided 
they attend high school in California for 

three or more years and graduate or obtain 
equivalency. 

The motion also encourages the six college 
councils to collect 200 signed postcards from 
their constituents by Feb. 24. The campus-
wide goal of collecting 1,500 postcards will 
also be assisted by student volunteers.  

“We wrote the resolution to let the student 
council know about the UCSA’s statewide 
campaign,” Castro said. “[Our campus] is a 
part of the UCSA, and the UCSA works as 
a coalition. The postcard campaign would 
allow students to recognize that there are 
students on campus who need the financial 
aid because [not everyone has] the privilege 
to apply for financial or institutional aid.” 

Castro said that the resolution passed 
through council with no objections and many 
councilmembers plan to attend a Feb. 28 
lobby conference in support of the act. 

“The Office is assisting the UCSA 
because it is a UC-wide campaign,” Lam 
said. “Last week, we tabled on Library Walk 
and this week, we will be going in and out 
of classrooms to talk to students about what 
we’re doing. We e-mail the professors ahead 
of time, and we only go into classrooms 
[where] we feel like the professors understand 
what the issues are.”

Alnaslah said. “Islam is not new to this country. 
It is nothing new to see this event [at UCSD].”

Members of the MSA have mostly reacted to 
these incidents positively. 

“The members said ‘Keep going, don’t let 
anything deter us from our events,’” Alnaslah 
said. 

One member, however, resigned from her 
position due to the hate e-mails, phone calls and 
text messages. She changed her phone number 
and Alnaslah said the member does not want to 
be contacted about the incidences.

Alnaslah said Islamic events generate 
emotional responses because of misconceptions 
about the religion, though he also noted that 

the adversity encouraged members to create a 
better awareness week.

“Education is the best way to abolish and 
cleanse awareness,” Alnaslah said. “This is our 
religion; take it from the source.”

Alnaslah said the most important result 
of the hate messages was getting the MSA 
community together and reassuring each 
member that the event will continue despite the 
opposition of a few.

“Your source is not Fox News,” Alnaslah 
said. “Judge the religion by its principles and 
its nature.”

Alnaslah said that at least two A.S. council 
members showed up to their events in response 
to the negativity MSA members received.

Two of council’s offices, the Office of Local 
Affairs and the Office of the President, endorsed 
this week’s events. Alnaslah said these actions 
have given MSA the initiative to continue their 
goal of education through Islam Awareness 
Week. 

“This hit towards the MSA and me as a 
Muslim-American is a process that will 
make me a stronger Muslim and a stronger 
American,” Alnaslah said. “[It] will uphold the 
values of Islam and the values of this beautiful 
country that will allow me the freedom of 
speech and religion.”

distances across ages and family sizes. The goal is to 
create a mirror reflection of what the actual buying 
population may be. In choosing a diverse sample 
group, the program can project future consumer 
patterns and preferences.

“We expect a strong response from people to 
respond to this opportunity,” Washom said.      

About 12 Smart City cars will be available for lease 
at the beginning of the 2011-12 academic year, with 
new models provided annually for three to four years 
thereafter. According to Washom, the 2011 study will 
most likely use the Nissan Leaf and Chevy Volt — 
models that, unlike hybrid-electric competitors such 
as the Toyota Prius, are able to run solely on electricity 
for extended periods.

“The idea is that as the price of electric vehicles 
decline and more units are produced, UCSD faculty, 
staff and students will be buying electric vehicles 
themselves and driving them to campus,” Washom 
said. 

UCSD, San Diego Gas & Electric and the City 
of San Diego will designate public charging areas 
on campus and throughout the city. Organizers are 
hopeful for green industry in San Diego, which they 
believe will be vital to the local economy.  

San Diego was one of multiple regions chosen 
in 2009 for stimulus-package grant money funneled 
toward clean energy research.  

About 11,210 electric vehicle charging stations 
will be implemented in home-base, commercial 
and public locations in support of public adoption 
of plug-in vehicles in major markets in five states: 
Arizona (Phoenix and Tucson metropolitan areas), 
Washington (Seattle area), Oregon (Portland, Salem, 
Corvallis and Eugene), California (San Diego) and 
Tennessee (Chattanooga, Knoxville and Nashville).

“UC San Diego is committed to working with our 
partners to develop and demonstrate innovations that 
will enable carbon-free transportation,” Chancellor 
Marye Anne Fox said in a Jan. 31 statement. “Through 
our collaboration and the university’s significant 
investment in renewable energy generation and 
storage, smart grid communication infrastructure and 
the expertise of our faculty and staff, we are poised to 
help with the successful adoption of electric vehicles 
in San Diego and eventually, mainstream America.”

hacking 
into the 
past

I tried to put off watching “Tangled.” I really did. But when I finished watch-ing all my regular shows on Hulu and 
an old suitemate implored me for the 
umpteenth time to see it with her, I had 
no choice.

What was supposed to be a lazy 
Saturday evening turned into a game of 
guess-what-happens-next-in-the-movie, 
and — all modesty aside — I totally 
owned it. As expected, the tropes of 
Disney fairy tales were blended together 
and unapologetically served up in this 
mush of a Rapunzel retelling.

Being disappointed in Disney isn’t 
surprising. “Tangled” is just another 
addition to my ongoing list of the Mouse 
House’s crappy new movies, Pixar exclud-
ed. It’s a resentment that I had managed 
to keep dormant since last year’s “Prince 
of Persia.” 

There’s no good reason that Disney 
can’t just stick to the magic they used 
when we were kids. Nothing beats 
Renaissance Disney. From 1989’s “The 
Little Mermaid” up to 1999’s “Tarzan,” 
Disney had the blessings of fairy god-
mothers everywhere on its side, bestow-
ing the world with a charm that, from 
the looks of it, is never to return. Here, 
in short, are my explanations for Disney’s 
decade-long crap-a-thon.  

1. The scripts aren’t jam-packed 
with cultural and historical allusions 
(or sexual undertones, either). 

I picked up more know-how with 
my eyes glued to the television playing 
Disney on repeat than during all my 
elementary school years. On my annual 
standardized test in fourth grade, I dis-
cerned the definition of “reprimand” 
because Ariel told me that, on land, 
fathers don’t reprimand their daughters. 

I could order beef ragout and cheese 
soufflé off a menu in France thanks to 
Beauty and the Beast’s “Be Our Guest.”  
Years later, in AP Euro, I already knew 
the motives for exploring the Americas 
thanks to the opening chorus of 
“Pocahontas:” “In 1607/ We sailed the 
open sea/ For glory, God and gold/ And 
the Virginia Company.” 

And let’s not pretend that “Hercules” 
didn’t help me with Greek mythology in 
HUM 1. 

You can revisit these movies years 
later and still find something new with 
each viewing. In case you weren’t in the 
loop, one of the golden spires in Ariel’s 
castle is shaped like a penis. The priest 
presiding over Ariel and Eric’s marriage is 
a little too excited for the nuptials. When 
Matthew Broderick-aged Simba collapses 
on top of a cliff, he sends a swirl of dust 
flying into the air that spells out the word 
“sex.” Aladdin tells Jasmine, right before 
their magic carpet ride, “Take off your 
clothes.” (In fact, listen to all of “A Whole 
New World” in the same vein, and you’ll 
have a whole new perspective on Disney’s 
family-friendly reputation.)    

2. Kids! They just love commercial 
garbage. 

Miley Cyrus and Demi Lovato. 
Enough said.

3. Plot originality was ditched back 
in Neverland. 

What movie has Disney not stripped 
of its dignity by making up its prequel, 
sequel or, better yet, threequel? Pixar, on 
the other hand, has always maintained

F
or some of us, the bips and 
beeps of the Game Boy are 
the soundtrack to child-
hood. The little ditty it 
played as you mastered 

Pokémon got stuck in your head for 
days. And nothing could encapsulate 
the frustration of stacking ill-shaped 
boxes more than the Tetris theme. Kids once 
had only vinyl records and rock ‘n’ roll — we 
got Nintendo and infectious bleeps. 

Now artists around the world 
are tapping into that influence, 
composing new melodies from 
forgotten gaming technologies. 
These artists create chiptunes — 
aka 8-bit, bitpop and chip music — by 
hacking and tweaking vintage video 
game systems, such as the Nintendo Game 
Boy and Nintendo Entertainment System, so 
that they work like a sequencer with four dif-
ferent channels.

For Sixth College junior Patrick Trinh, the 
genre has been a revelation. He started teaching 
himself chiptunes last spring and now — under stage 
name Space Town Savior — has already landed himself 
an opening gig for mash-up DJs the Hood Internet at 
the Loft next Tuesday, among other shows with bitpop 
artists around Southern California. 

“I’m still in shock at how fast it has happened,” Trinh 
said. “Three months ago I was like, ‘If I play a show in 
a year, dude, I can consider myself successful.’ And now 
I’m playing with Trash80 and shooting the shit with these 
people that I’ve been listening to for more than a year.”

Despite this success, Trinh almost gave up completely soon 
after he first started. 

“I did it for a while and then realized I sucked and tried to do 
something else,” he said. “I basically wanted to be Nosaj Thing … 
and then I realized I wasn’t good at that. So I sat down and thought, 
‘I wanna do music, but I don’t know how to.’ And then I eventually

decided that I could go back to chiptunes.”
Trinh was hooked by the aesthetic.  
“It’s almost like a McLuhan thing — ‘the medium is 

the message.’ There’s something about the fact that you 
can only have four channels, and one of the channels 
can only make noise, that makes it so 
your music has to be melodic,” he said. 
“Otherwise you could just do some-

have to use old video game hardware.”

Trinh said he also appreciates the 
flexibility of the medium.

“There’s no set thing for what chip-
tunes is,” he said. “It’s not all dance 
music, it’s not all super hardcore music 
— it’s like chiptunes is more of just a 
description of a medium that we use to 
make all kinds of music.”

The chiptunes scene is international, 
and artists use the technology in drasti-
cally different ways. 

LA’s Trash80 makes ambient sounds 
using his Game Boy, while groups like 
New York City-based Anamanaguchi — 
who composed the music for the “Scott 
Pilgirm vs. The World: The Game” 
soundtrack — use an NES (in addition 
to traditional rock instruments) to pro-
duce loud, fast punk. 

But the scene isn’t always so lively; after all, the 
music mainly appeals to a small niche. Sixth College 
freshman Joshua Edra attempted to start an 8-bit col-
lective at UCSD last fall — which led to Trinh’s first 

performances on Library Walk — but Trinh said the 
effort fell apart just after the initial e-mails were sent. 

Trinh said the genre has taken off more in L.A., 
though chiptune artists mostly meet through the 
expected avenue: the Internet.

The geographically disjointed subculture can 
connect on websites like 8bitcollective 
(http://8bc.org/), where anyone can easily 
upload to a file-sharing chiptune com-
munity. 

Artists are encouraged to register their 
music under Adobe Creative Commons in 
order to create a free, open-source envi-
ronment, and the site advocates an open, 
DIY ethic.

“More people should do it because it’s 
actually not that hard to get into,” Trinh 
said. “Even if you don’t have enough 
money to buy a Game Boy, you can totally 
just download an emulator, which emu-
lates a Game Boy on your computer.”  

It isn’t just for nerds, either. Many 8-bit 
artists are too young to have experienced 
old school Nintendo products. 

“Before it was like everyone who was 
into chiptunes was like, ‘Oh yeah, I grew 
up with the Nintendo,’” he said. “But as 
the scene grows, and more people get into 
it, the younger generation hasn’t even 
touched a Game Boy before getting into 
this music.”

Patrick Trinh — aka Space Town Savior — will 
be opening for the Hood Internet at the Loft show on 
Tuesday, Feb. 22 at 8 p.m. Tickets are $6 for students.

S ince Conor Oberst started releasing music in 1997 under the Bright Eyes 
moniker, he’s gone from 
side-banged, emo-kid poster-
child to “next Dylan” prodigy 
and Americana troubadour. 
Now, with his return on The 
People’s Key (he’s been playing 
with Monsters of Folk and 
going solo with the Mystic 
Valley Band since 2007), 
Oberst is striving for his mas-
terpiece. 

The album has all the 
ingredients of a magnum 
opus — arty spoken-word 
interludes, Catholic angst, an 
expanded sonic palate — but 
somehow, the pieces don’t 
add up. 

Oddly un-ironic ram-
blings, courtesy of Refried 
Ice Cream singer Denny 
Brewer, contemplate the 
cosmos… and, naturally, an 
ancient Sumerian theory on 
Anunnaki aliens. The sci-fi 
outbursts are humorously 
absurd at first, particularly 
on “Firewall,” but by their 
third appearance (“A Machine 
Spiritual”), they start to 
resemble the relentless bark of 
street-corner sermons. 

The lyrics are rife with 
mythical and spiritual refer-
ences: Sisyphus and an “L.A. 
shaman” are name-dropped, 
and on “Triple Spiral,” Oberst 
ruminates on his loss of faith 
(“I loved you Triple Spiral — 
father, son and ghost/But you 
left me in my darkest hour 
when I needed you”). The 
instrumentation — all syn-
thesizers and distorted guitars 
— spoils what would nor-
mally be emotive songwriting. 
Catchy as the songs often are, 
they don’t have much impact. 

It’s clear that Oberst is try-
ing to ditch the folk style he’s 
championed on some of his 
best records, such as 2005’s 
I’m Wide Awake It’s Morning, 
to become a full-fledged 
frontman; problem is, he’s 
always been most powerful 
on his own. 

It’s no coincidence that the 
simplest track, “Ladder Song,” 
is the album’s best. The som-
ber piano ballad — an emo-
tional mediation on a friend’s 
death — harkens back to the 
honesty that made Oberst so 
appealing in the first place.

Oberst Explores God and the 
Cosmos Amongst Crackpot Rants 

B y sidestepping the “style over substance” trend of underground music, 
Yuck distinguishes itself from 
the bands that have already 
tried to rekindle the garage 
rock attitude of the ’90s. 
Yuck’s self-titled debut may 
have been recorded in an 
apartment, but this London 
quartet swaps out the stan-
dard dose of lo-fi found in 
basements and year-end lists 
for some breadth of sound. 

Songwriter Daniel 
Blumberg’s age — he’s all of 
20 years old — helps him add 
a sense of youthfulness to the 
album. Some artists dwell on 
past experience to express 
ideals of young romance 
and heartbreak — Blumberg 
reports from the frontlines; 
on “Sunday,” for example, he 
proclaims his newfound self-
identity (“I’ve got a choice 
now/I’ve got a voice now”). 

Yuck’s versatility is their 
most valuable asset, though 
the temptation to make 
references to various bands 
in the “classic” indie rock 
canon can be overwhelm-
ing. Thankfully, they switch 
gears after nearly every track. 

Album-opener, “Get Away,” 
sports an intro guitar lick 
that J Mascis would be proud 
of; “Holing Out” achieves 
Superchunk-level power pop 
status and “Operation” hints 
at the jagged staccato of Sonic 
Youth. On the other hand, 
“Suicide Policeman” sounds 
like an ode to the late Elliott 
Smith on multiple levels. 

Amidst all today’s pol-
ished beats, it’s endearing to 
hear a record that sounds like 
it was made by a few nerds 
who are too familiar with 
obscure artists back cata-
logues for their own good. 
Yuck’s efforts haven’t gone 
neglected: Several of their 
influences, including Modest 
Mouse and Built to Spill, have 
recruited them as openers. 

But Yuck has made sure 
to prove they aren’t just 
another cover band. Their 
first single, “Rubber,” is a 
slow burner that combines 
enough heavy feedback with 
Blumberg’s wistful vocals to 
suggest they’ve got more than 
a few hooks and dutiful hom-
ages up their sleeves.

T im Hecker’s Ravedeath, 1972 is supposed to be a rumination on 
the digital music era and a 
self-declared bit of “secular 
musical transcendentalism” 
(whatever that means). 
Somehow, this translates 
to tracks that consist pri-
marily of heavily altered 
recordings of the song-
writer playing pipe organ 
over one day in a church in 
Reykjavik, Iceland. It’s not 
exactly the party album of 
the year, but thankfully, the 
Montreal native manages 
to transcend the novelty 
(or schtick) of Ravedeath’s 
backstory by imbuing the 
album with raw musicality.

On “The Piano Drop,” 
organ tones distort into 
dense waves of static. At 
the track’s climax, Hecker 
tames and sculpts the chaos 
into vast, melancholic 
swaths of noise that might 
sound at home on a Sunn 
O))) record. 

The sense of tension is 
matched on similarly dark 
“Hatred of Music.” Though 
not as immediately aggres-
sive as the record’s opener, 

the two-part suite con-
tains the sort of dramatic, 
menacing sheets of sound 
that have become Hecker’s 
trademark.

But Ravedeath truly 
shines when Hecker aban-
dons ear-splitting violence 
for poignant contempla-
tion. On the outstanding 
“In the Air I,” Hecker’s 
pipe organ drones have 
an orchestral quality, with 
wavering high notes danc-
ing above clean bass. 

The result evokes the 
sort of massive, frigid 
beauty one would expect of 
the album’s birth country.

Between the backstory 
and the tendencies toward 
drone and ambience, 
Ravedeath, 1972 is nothing 
if not intimidating. 

But Tim Hecker’s ear 
for texture, as well as his 
ability to wield droning 
sonics with a keen sense of 
musicianship and composi-
tion, validates his effortless 
command over the mystify-
ing genre.

T he early-Aughties show “Queer as Folk” nudged gay culture one ruby-red slipper closer to the mainstream. As Will and Grace exchanged their thousandth hackneyed pun, characters on the Showtime series dealt with 
laugh track-unfriendly issues ranging from coming out to adoption to HIV/
AIDS.

They also, as it happens, spent a lot of time dancing in the club to here-
and-queer anthems that sound an awful lot like Lady Gaga’s latest. “Born This 
Way” is a shock of throwbacks and cultural appropriations, co-opting both 
Madonna’s “Express Yourself” chin-up lyricism and the campy house style 
long associated with gay culture. 

“Don’t be a drag, just be a queen,” Mother Monster speak-sings. Rhyming 
“Orient” with “Chola descent” might rub the touchier folks in the crowd the 
wrong way, but everybody else should just be happy to party like it’s 1989 (the 
year “Express Yourself” first hit the radio). 

The single is, in some ways, the next logical move in Gaga’s quest for glob-
al domination. There’s no louder advocate of letting one’s freak flag hang high 
than Lady Gaga; in that way, this ode to outsiders might have been inevitable. 
And in its unabashed hijacking of Gaga’s influences, “Born This Way” is a 
trite, uninventive letdown. We’re dancing along anyway.

For Chiptunes Music, a Game Boy Is All You Need

▶ chiptunes from page 7

a fidelity to original plotlines, and 
that explains why their films are so 
superior (though the company tech-
nically was acquired by Disney in 
2006). Toys that spring to life when 
humans are absent and monsters 
that scare toddlers to provide energy 
for Monstropolis are far cries from 
the rote fairy tales that Disney’s new 
animated films hash again and again. 

Granted, the plots of Renaissance 
Disney films aren’t exactly original 
either. Many are adaptations of tra-
ditional fairy or folk tales, but at least 
then, the films celebrated diversity 
by exposing children to different cul-
tures (and not in that overt “Princess 
and the Frog” kind of way). 

To be sure, Renaissance Disney 
did have racist undertones. (As 
Disney would have you believe, all 
Arabs — no wait, just the citizens 
of Agrabah — are Philistines and 
will cut off your ear if they don’t like 

your face: “It’s barbaric/But, hey, it’s 
home.”) But those instances were 
scant, and for the benefit of learn-
ing the butchered legends of Mulan, 
Quasimodo and Tarzan, I’d say it 
was a fair price for our then-spongy 
minds to pay. 

The regurgitated tripe Disney’s 
been churning out lately— with a 
few exceptions, like “Enchanted” — 
have me shaking my head instead of 
feeling zip-a-dee-doo-dah happy, as 
the oldies still make me. 

It’s probably a good sign that 
after the release of “Tangled” in late 
2010, Pixar Animation Studios chief 
Ed Catmull nixed the two fairytale 
projects in gestation saying, “They 
may come back later because some-
one has a fresh take on it… but we 
don’t have any other musicals or 
fairy tales lined up.” 

Good choice. I’ll still take 
Renaissance Disney over “Tangled” 
any Saturday night.

HIATUS THURSDAY, febRUARY 17, 2011 THe UCSD GUARDIAN 9

Lippe tells his friend working security).  
Blissfully naïve Lippe starts off content 

with his life in Brown Valley; he remains 
in his childhood home, seeking guidance 
from his boss, Bill (Stephen Root), and 
bedding his seventh-grade teacher Macy 
(Sigourney Weaver). But when Lippe is 
sent to the annual convention in Cedar 
Rapids, Iowa, he finally gets a taste of the 
big city. 

There Lippe meets his first “Afro-
American,” Ronald Wilkes (“The Wire’”s 
Isiah Whitlock Jr.), womanizing frat boy-
Dean Ziegler (John C. Reilly) and party 
girl Joan Ostrowski-Fox (Anne Heche).

The magic of “Cedar Rapids” comes 
from its insistence on real characters. 
Ziegler isn’t crude for the sake of being 
crude; it’s just his own private rebellion 
against the wholesomeness of his small 
town life, and Reilly portrays this well.

Heche’s Joan — a woman taking 
a break from married life — is both 
funny and alluring, while Whitlock nails 
Ronald’s deadpan in a string of hysterical-
ly unfunny jokes (“Knock knock”/“Who’s 
there?”/“No one. I’m sick”). 

Like the characters that populate small 
towns, the humor of “Cedar Rapids” is 
centered on kernels of goodness. The 
comedy develops as Lippe finds himself 
pushed further down the rabbit hole by 
Ziegler, Wilkes and Fox, who corrupt him 
one Bloody Mary at a time. It’s these often 
ill-fated attempts at rebellion that make 
“Cedar Rapids” so endearing. Despite all 
their faults, there is nothing that will stop 
these friends from helping each other.

Sometimes it may be too sweet for its 
own good, but director Miguel Arteta takes 
producer Alexander Payne’s ( “Election,” 
“About Schmidt”) lead, and crafts characters 
that ultimately feel like a part of a family. 
Even if they spend time fighting a couple 
crackheads, it’s hard not to appreciate Lippe 
and his bumbling sidekicks for being believ-
able, everyman antiheroes.

F rom “Twilight” to “Percy Jackson,” super-human-teen flicks are about as bankable a trend as any in Hollywood. The latest of the 
heap, “I Am Number Four,” dredges its way into 
the genre with more blemish-free teenagers and 
watered-down sci-fi.

With “Eagle Eye” and “Disturbia” direc-
tor D.J. Caruso at the helm, one would at least 

expect plenty of action. But 
“Number Four” manages 
to disappoint even in that 
regard. 

The movie follows a race 
of aliens that sends their 
magically powered progeny 
to Earth after their home 
planet is destroyed by the 
big bad guys of the universe, 

named the Mogadorians, or “Mogs.” Each 
super-teen is named by a number, and for some 
inexplicable reason, the Mogs are hunting them 
down in sequential order. 

Blond Abercrombie Adonis Number Four — 
under the typical pseudonym John Smith (Alex 
Pettyfer) — escapes to sleepy Paradise, Ohio, 
where he attempts to hide as a normal teen. 
Predictably, John falls for the pretty girl, Sarah 

(“Glee”’s Dianna Agron), though their chemis-
try is stale and orchestrated. Pettyfer lacks any 
sort of conviction when it comes to his suppos-
edly deep feelings for his love interest, while 
Agron’s unaffecting performance comes off like 
she was on anti-anxiety meds for all of filming. 

The few moments of fun come from John’s 
friend Sam (Callan McAuliffe). The requisite 
geek of the bunch, Sam is constantly badgered 
by the in-crowd for believing in aliens, yet 
he still manages a few snarky one-liners in 
between taunts. 

Surprise, surprise: The Mogs inevitably hunt 
John down, culminating in the battle we’ve all 
been waiting for. Unfortunately, these scenes are 
unsatisfying at best, as the supposedly badass 
Mogs barely manage to put up a fight. Think skin-
heads with facial tattoos and cartoonish monster 
pets fighting humans, and you’ll understand why 
the battle is more laughable than terrifying.

Just when you think you’re in for a tidy 
resolution, it becomes clear that we’re being 
primed for a sequel and a full franchise — but 
with a first installment this uninspiring, we 
can only hope the future of the Mogs and their 
cool-kid adversaries is left open-ended for 
good.

MEN’S AND WOMEN’S 
TENNIS — The UCSD men’s 
tennis team continued its hot 
start to the season, sweep-
ing all of its matches at the 
Grand Canyon Invitational. The 
Tritons defeated Dallas Baptist 
9-0, No. 11 Hawaii Pacific 5-4, 
Grand Canyon 5-4 and Hawaii 
Hilo 6-3.

The No. 1 doubles team of 
senior Erik Elliott and sopho-
more Austin West put on an 
impressive display, winning all 
four of their matches over the 
three-day tournament. Elliott 
also won three of his matches as 
the No. 1 singles player. Junior 
Chapman Chan won three 
matches as the No. 2 singles 
player.  

After steamrolling Dallas 
Baptist on Friday, the Tritons 
had two close matches on 
Saturday with the doubles teams 
stepping up to help the Tritons 
get the victories. The teams 
split the singles matches 3-3, 
but the doubles teams of Elliott 
and West, as well as Armuan 
Emami and Jason Wall, secured 
victories. 

Against Hawaii Hilo, the 
Tritons won only one of their 
three doubles matches to fall 
behind early. But UCSD came 
back to win five of the six singles 
matches, with victories from 
Elliott, Chan, Vincent Nguyen, 
Max Jiganti and Maxence 
Dutreix.

The Tritons have started the 
season with six straight wins, 
and look set to move up from 
their preseason No. 31 ITA 
ranking.  

At the same tournament, the 

Triton women got their two first 
wins of the season, defeating 
Dallas Baptist 5-4 and Hawaii-
Hilo 9-0. The Tritons also fell to 
Hawaii Pacific 1-8.  

The match against Dallas 
Baptist was determined by 
senior Cindy Dao’s singles 
match, which she won 6-4, 6-4.  

“It was nice getting that first 
win; it tied at four and came 
down to Dao’s singles match,” 
head coach Liz LaPlante said. 
“It was a great match. Cindy 
was mentally solid and focused. 
Cindy just played great. It was 
really good for the girls to see 
the intensity necessary to win 
the match.”

The Tritons fell to Hawaii 
Pacific — who they lost to at 
regional last year — 1-8 in their 
second match. HPU is a power-
house in women’s tennis, often 
fielding several foreign players.

In their third match, the 
Tritons defeated Hawaii-Hilo, 
who LaPlante expected to beat.

“We came out ready to play, 
and did,” LaPlante said. “It was 
good to get the win.” 

No. 1 singles player Taskeen 
Baines won two of her three 
singles matches over the week-
end, and all three of her doubles 
matches while paired with Haley 
Perrotte.

The Triton women will 
face off against Division III 
C l a r e m o n t - Mu d d - S c r i p p s 
Saturday at UCSD at 11 a.m., 
a team they have not played 
since the move to Division II in 
2000. The Triton men return to 
action on Thursday in an away 
match against Azusa Pacific 
University.

enough to overcome the Gauchos, as UCSB came 
out with a 12-7 victory and ended the tourna-
ment on a low note for the Tritons.

“We really thought we had a chance at taking 
that one here at our pool, especially after only 
losing by one at their pool,” Kreutzkamp said. 
“They came out and put away all their shots 
early, burying us 5-1 in the first quarter; it was 
just too big of a hole for us to dig out.”

The Tritons play rival Loyola Marymount this 
Friday at Canyon View Pool at 6 p.m., looking 
for revenge from last year’s WWPA conference 
championship game that the Lions won 13-10.

“We’re trying to stay upbeat and up tempo,” 
Kreutzkamp said. “Because LMU plays very 
fast, quick and aggressive. We’ll be on our heels 
pretty quick. So we’re going to practice quick and 
upbeat this week.”

No. 17 Tritons See Mixed Results as Hosts of  Triton Invitational

UCSD went 2-2 at the Triton Invitational, beating Santa Clara and Maryland but falling to Harwick and UCSB.

A four-game sweep of San Francisco State this weekend gave the UCSD softball team its 
best start since 2002. The Tritons won 
8-0 and 7-3 on Friday, and 7-3 and 2-0 
on Saturday.

“Four wins are great,” head coach 
Patti Gerckens said in an interview with 
the UCSD Athletics Department. “San 
Francisco is actually a good club, and 
it was a good way to start our season. It 
really sets the tone going into next week 
against Monterey Bay.”

The Tritons only had four hits in the 
first game, but San Francisco commit-
ted five errors to allow the Tritons to 
score eight runs in the five-inning game. 
Kris Lesovsky, Caitlin Brown and Katrin 
Gabriel each had an RBI, as the Tritons 

capitalized on Gator errors, with only 
two of their runs earned. 

Camille Gaito went the distance, giv-
ing up five hits and two walks to get the 
win.

In the second game on Friday, Tess 
Granath pitched a complete game and 
got the win, as the Tritons once again 
capitalized on Gator mistakes. Granath 
gave five hits and three runs, but the 
Tritons scored four runs in the bottom 
of the sixth to take the victory. 

In the sixth, with the game tied at 
three, UCSD loaded the bases with two 
outs. Nicole Spangler hit a weak ground 
ball to the shortstop, but a wild throw 
allowed all three runners to score. Mya 
Romero drove Spangler in to add an 
extra run for the Tritons.

In the first game of Saturday’s double-
header, UCSD put up six runs in the first 
three innings and held on for the win. 
The Tritons got two RBI from Jennifer 
De Fazio and Esther Storm. Granath 
pitched five 2/3 innings to pick up the 
win, giving up seven hits and two runs. 

In the second game on Saturday, 
Gaito was perfect through five 2/3 
innings before giving up a double. But 
she would stay in the game and go the 
distance, getting the two-hit shutout and 
sending her record to 5-0 on the season. 
Gaito has allowed just one earned run 
this season, striking out 27 batters in 35 
1/3 innings of play.

WOMEN’S WATER POLO — 
After a long weekend featuring five 
games and hosting opponents from 
all across the country, the 17th-
ranked UCSD women’s water polo 
team completed its tournament 
by taking 10th-place overall at the 
Triton Invitational. The weekend 
started off with a close win against 
Cal State East Bay Friday night, and 
lasted until late Sunday afternoon 
with a loss to No. 12 UC Santa 
Barbara, with the Tritons going 2-2 
in tournament play.

“It wasn’t too bad of a week-
end,” head coach Brad Kreutzkamp 
said. “But we can definitely strive to 
do better. We’re still looking for a 
big signature win for this program, 
but as far as the rankings are con-
cerned, we beat the teams we were 
supposed to and lost to the teams 
we were supposed to.”

On Saturday, the Tritons started 
the Triton Invitational by losing 
against Hartwick for the second 
consecutive year, but defeated con-
ference opponent Santa Clara in 
their second game. 

Against Hartwick, the Tritons 
fell into dire straits early and 
couldn’t muster the strength to 
recover. The Tritons fought to keep 

the score within three at the half, 
but Hartwick came out strong in 
the third quarter and outscored 
the Tritons 5-1. The teams would 
exchange goals in the final quarter, 
but it was not enough energy to get 
the Tritons back into the game, and 
they fell to the Hawks 11-4 

“I was definitely disappoint-
ed with our play in that game,” 
Kreutzkamp said. “I felt that we 
played very flat and not up to the 
best of our potential. And when the 
game was over we let them know 
how bad it feels to lose a game like 
that, and we can’t let that happen to 
us again.”

Against Santa Clara, senior 
attacker Hanalei Crowell scored two 
goals in the first quarter to help give 
UCSD a 3-1 lead. The Tritons kept 
the two-goal advantage through the 
half with strong offense, leading 6-4 
at the break. Both teams showed a 
lot of offense through the second 
half, as they both scored five goals 
in the third quarter. The Broncos 
cut the lead down to one after scor-
ing three unanswered goals in the 
last four minutes, and had pos-
session with just over 30 seconds 
to play. But a steal by the Tritons 
and a quick goal by junior hole set 
Kirstin Bates sealed the victory for 
the Tritons, 12-10.

On Sunday, the Tritons took 

on Maryland — a team they will 
not face again this season. The 
Terrapins scored first in the game, 
but the Tritons were relentless on 
offense, as Crowell scored three 
goals in the first half and Bates 
added another two as the Tritons 
jumped to a 7-3 halftime lead. 

The Terrapins lost all hope of 
staging a comeback in the second 
half, when junior utility Natalie 
Peng added two goals of her own 
and the Triton defense blocked 
most of the Terrapin shots. The 
Tritons finished with a solid 9-5 
victory.

In the final game of the tourna-
ment, the Tritons faced UC Santa 
Barbara, who defeated UCSD 
by one goal in the final game of 
the Winter Invitational at UCSB 
on Jan. 30. With the game tied 
at one halfway through the open-
ing quarter, the Gauchos slashed 
the Triton defense and scored five 
unanswered points to take a 6-1 
lead. But the Tritons did manage to 
reduce deficit a little, and thanks to 
goals by Crowell and freshman util-
ity and Santa Barbara native Leah 
Gonzales, the Tritons pulled within 
6-3 at the break. Freshman hole set 
Melissa Bartow tallied two goals 
in the second half, but it was not
