A.S. Council 
Planning 

Constitution 
Redraft 
By Malt L'Heureux 

SENIOR STAFF WRITER 

In response to student protests 
regarding ambiguities in campus poli-
cies, A.S. President Harry Khanna 
commissioned a task force to revise 
and consolidate documents regulating 
student government. 

Student organizations complained 
about the inefficiency of A.S. Council 
rules - especially fmancial bylaws 
- earlier this year when the Student 
Funding Advisory Board bypassed 
funding for several groups because of 
constitutional technicalities. 

The Ad Hoc Task Force on ASUCSD 
Constitution. Bylaws. Policie and 
Rules. appointed on June 6. consists of 
Khanna and six other councilmembers 
who will scrutinize each of the various 
council documents during fall quarter 
of next year. 

"We probably will revise every sin-
gle one;' Khanna said. 

Contradictions between the A.S. 
onstitution and bylaws. which gov-

ern the council's activity, have proven 
troublesome during council meetings 
this past year. causing some council-
members to stress the need for change 
to the documents. 

"The A. . bylaws haven't been 
rewritten in decades. I think; Khanna 
said. "We're looking for a way to make 
A.S .... less bureaucratic:' 

Another goal of the task force is to 
bring the council's governing docu-
ments in line with the newest technical 
advancements available to make sure 
that all aspects of council affairs run as 
effectively as possible. 

"We want to know how we can 
revise them to be up to date with aU the 
new technologies;' Khanna said. 

According to Khanna. the task 
force hopes to condense all the policies 
down to just a few to avoid conflicts 
like the bylaws and constitution con-
tradicting one another. 

"We're checking every single detail;' 
he said. 

The body will likely begin to dis-
cuss plans over the summer, and is 
set to begin its work one week prior 
to Welcome Week. Khanna said he 
believes that the task force will release 
five to six reports of its findings before 
the current council's term ends. He 
hopes the first report will be released 
during the fifth week of fall quarter. 

The application process for the task 
force was intensive and the time com-
mitment will be high. Khanna said. 
Overall. he said he is optimistic about 
the changes that the task force could 
bring to the cohesiveness of the whole 
council. 

"Once all is said and done. we'll 
hopefully have made a really positive 
change for A.S.," Kharma said.

Cable Policy Draft Nearing Close STUDENTS

Interest rates for 
federal loans set to 
increase this summer, 
hitting levels of nearly 
7 percent.

CONTRIBUTING WR ITER 

The average UC D enior will be 
in debt $14.500 with student loans 
after graduating this month, and the 
amount is likely to increase after inter-
est rates for federal loans rise this sum-
mer.

Acting Assistant Vice Chancellor of Student Life Gary R. Ratcliff is close to implementing the "acceptable use policy' governing Triton 
Cable. which would not be permitted to broadcast some forms of indecent material if the document were approved. 

The Department of Education and 
federal financial aid as a whole are 
taking one of the mo t severe cuts 
in the federal budget, according to 
UCSD Financial Aid Director Vincent 
De Anda. 

On July 1. the Deficit Reduction 
Act of 2005 will impact students who 
use federal loans to help pay for college 
tuition costs. Passed by Congress in 
February, the legislation will increase

Bitter Politics Prolong Nursing Contract Decision 
By Serena Renner 

STAFF WRITER 

"Reopener" negotiations between 
the University of California and the 
California Nurses Association con-
cluded last week with both sides still 
divided on key areas of the two-year 
nursing contracts. The lack of resolu-
tion at the fmal session marked the 
end of the two-party talks and the 
entrance of an independent medi.ator. 

The back-and-forth debate that 
swept discussions has prompted one 
agreement - to declare an "impasse;' 
in which the Public Employment 
Relations Board will appoint a media-
tor to assist in decision making. 

CNA and the university completed 
this identical process last year to estab-
lish the 2005-07 nursing contracts. 
However. after I I months. the two 
sides failed to agree on the four most 
difficult issues - salaries, healthcare, 
retiree health and meal breaks. 

CNAS current proposal is aimed 
at confronting the recr:uitrnent and 
retention crisis at UC medical centers, 
where hundreds of nurses have left 
UC hospitals in search of higher sala-
ries and better benefits. CNA's director 

UNMRSITY OF CALIFORNIA VS. NURSES: NO END IN SIGHT? 
Sept 2005: 13.5 pen:ent II\IerI(Ie salary increase for UC nurses. July through· Aug. 2006: Fact-

finding win occur if mediation 
fails to produce alln:!ement. 

Dec. 9, 2005: Anal decision made 
on contracts, with -reopener" 
neaotiations set for spring April ~ june 2006: "Ieopener" talks dis-

aissed salaries and reti!emeIIt benefits. faCWIt_l.tD dIdde on 

for UC negotiations Beth Kean said. 
The urliversity denies that it has a 

staffing "crisis; reporting low vacancy 
and turnover rates, and claims that the 
university is at or above the market 
average in terms of compensation and 
salaries, UC Office of the President 
spokesman Noel Van Nyhuis said. 

Despite a 13.5-percent salary 
increase in 2005, CNA insists that 
UC nurses are still underpaid com-
pared to the local market. 

The discrepancy in the University 

of California's statistics lies in the 
university's method of including 
very low-paid areas like EI Centro to 
reduce the market averages in order 
to make the university look more 
competitive, Kean said. 

"It's like Mark Twain's quote, 
'There are lies, damned lies and sta-
tistics,'" Kean said. "Numbers can be 
presented in any way to prove the 
point you're trying to make. [The uni-
versity is] using [its] numbers politi-
caJ¥' 

Even if averages were representa-
tive, such wages are insufficient con-
sidering the complexity of UC patient 
care, Kean said. mentioning that 
university medical centers house the 
sickest patients and the largest organ-
transplant program in the state. 

When asked about the intricacies 
of UC nursing. Van Nyhuis said that 
this point has not been mentioned in 
the negotiations.

SUNGOD & TRITON 

Loan Rates to Remain Stagnant for Next Five Years 
• DEBT, from gage 1 
graduates have federal or private loans. 
Between the 1992-93 and 200Z-03 
academic years, the percentage of 
bachelor's degree redpients who used 
loans to finance their undergraduate 
education increased from 49 percent 
to 65 percent - with the average debt 
ofSI2,IOO jumping to S19,300 nation-
wide . • 

Earl Warren CoUege senior Dylan 
Seaton will become one of those statis-
tics when he graduates this fall. 

" ! wish there was another way [to 
pay college tuition fees) , but there real-
ly isn't:' Seaton said 

UCSO's Financial Aid Office is try-
ing to accommodate the new changes. 
The Stafford loan offers two versions 
- the fll'St is a federal-based loan, 
while the other is funded through 
private lenders. Unlike U C Berkeley, 
UCSD uses private lenders to fund 
Stafford loans. 

"Some of our lenders offer ben-
efits, and we get better rates than we 
can get from the federal program:' 
De Anda said "Because these lenders 
are competing. they're taking some of 

their profits and returning them [to 
students] in reduced rates:' 

Previously. the Stafford loan was a 
variable rate, fluctuating with inflation 
- with this year's rate at 5.3 percent 
- But with the changing federal bud-
get and the significant decrease in edu-
cational funding, the loan wiU stay at a 
fixed rate of 6.8 percent for at least five 
years, according to De Anda. 

According to the College Board, 
which compiles college loan statistics, 
the federal loan volume for student bor-
rowing skyrocketed from $20.7 billion 
to $49.1 billion in the last decade - a 
137 percent increase in student debts. 

"A general increase in students, a 
general increase in costs, attendance, 
an increase in grants [in the state] ... 
should take some of the edge off and 
reduce [students' debts) a little bit:' De 
Anda said. "A lot of [the reductions in 
student debt) have to do with pretty 
generous grant programs:' 

When asked about suggestions for 
future students who need financial aid, 
Seaton recommended that students 
avoid withdrawing loans at all costs, 
and instead apply for as many scho!-

Guardian Staff Photo 2005-06 

arships as possible. Seaton has a few 
student scholanhips assisting his col-
lege tuition, but still has to take out a 
substantial amount of loans. 

"It's unfortunate that once you're 
ready to get out to the real work\, 
you're in such a hole already:' Seaton 
said "So many students are being put 
in that position:' 

Fortunately, students' debts do 
not seem to be significantly deter-
ring enrollment in graduate education. 
Despite escalating debts, 21 percent 
of 1999-00 graduates .pursued higher 
education one year after graduating 
from a four-year university, compared 
to 16 percent of their 1992-93 equiva-
lents. 

"I'm going to be in debt enough 
after I graduate:' Seaton said. "It sucks, 
and it's going to be a long uphill battle 
to pay these off ... but at the end of it, 
there is that knowledge that you put 
yourself through college - that you 
didn't rely entirely on your parents. So 
I guess it feels good in that way.

In any Keanu Reeves film you arc privy to three looks: bored, confused and a nice, ambiguous 
grin. In ''A Scanner Darkly:' direc-

impossible task of rotoscoping 
each of these facial expressions. 
Seems hard, right? Well, thank 
goodness Linklater is on board, 
because one must have incredible 
talent to animate Reeves' blank 
stares.

Anyone interested in another

to ventu re elsewhere. Linklater

THE DEVIL WEAR~ PRADA 
The Devil Wears Prada" is a chic-lit novel with a backstory more interesting than the book itself. The piece of fluff was penned by Lauren Weisberger, former assistant to 
the notoriously bitchy editor in chief of Vogue magazine, 
Anna Wintour (aka Nuclear Wintour.) Not surprisingly, 
Wiesberger's book chronicles the travails of helpless fashion 
assistant Andrea Sachs, who has to kow-tow to the ridicu-
lous demands of her boss, Miranda Priestly - the notori-
ously bitchy editor in chief of Runway magazine. 

A book this creative was bound to be adapted into a 
major motion picture, but what actress has the gravitas 
to play Wintour - I mean Priestly? None other than

ven if you don't particularly enjoy Andre 3000 and Big , 
Boi's uppity hip-hop, you can't deny their unfailing 
ability to entertain. Some of MTY's frnest moments 

have been had during Outkast videos: the hook-howling 
animals of "Ms. Jackson," psychad\!lic politics of "Bombs 
Over Baghdad" and high-school musical bop of "Roses" 
are enough to kick your ass off the couch to bust some 
moves of your own. The only thing left on the pair's 
agenda is Hollywood - and they're gonna do it big. 

With "Idlewild," Outkast keep the entertainment on 

dialect queen and Oscar favorite Meryl Streep. Whether 
or not Streep will hideously overact in this villainous 
performance as she did in "The Manchurian Candidate" 
remains to be seen, but the actress did slim down to play 
the cruel fashionista. A mousy Anne Hathaway, whose 
weak on-screen presence was never more prevalent 
than in "Brokeback Mountain," will play Weisberger 
- I mean Sachs. Essentially, perfect casting for a chic-
lit flick.

t first glance, it seems like a worthwhile concept: 
Everyman Matt (Luke Wilson, the go-to for regular 
error-prone guys) ditches his needy girlfriend Jenny 

(Uma Thurman) for a co-worker ("Scary Movie" girl Anna 
Faris), only to discover that Jenny is, in fact, a superhero, 
and she's out to avenge her broken heart. The cast is 1I0t 
too shabby: Thurman as a kooky, ass-kicking, pissed-off 
bitch with an axe to grind (aka "Kill Bill"), the infallible 
executive transvestite Eddie Izzard as a professor ("Cake 
or Death," anyone?) and "Office" funnyman Rainn Wilson 
as Matt's sidekick best friend. Even director Ivan Reitman 
is a comedy veteran whose credits include "Meatballs," 
"Stripes" and "Ghostbusters:' But the current trailer for 

Reitman's endeavor contains awkward and uainspired 
scenes, none of which elicit the least amount of laughter. 
Perhaps that's not the best thing for a film marketing itself 
as a romantic comedy. It is possible that the cast wiJJ pull 
through, though - Wilson manages to be subtly hilariQUS 
in "The Royal Tenenbaums," and Thurman has had some 
well-timed comedic moments in under-the-radar "Prime." 
However, unless the missing humor-inducing scenes are 
injected back into the preview, word-of-mouth is the best 
way to decide to go see this one.

SHAKES ON A 
PNE 

~ nakes on a Plane," starring Samuel L. Jackson. What else do you real-ly need to know? Jackson signed 
onto the project without even read-
ing the script; the title was enough for 
him. However, there is much more 
to the movie than its title and badass 
motherfucker of a star. "Snakes on 
a Plane" has the potential to change 
the way movies are shot and market-
ed, after an Internet frenzy over the 
movie prompted New Line Cinema 
to reopen filming in order to include 
scenes and even lines ("I want these 
motherfucking snakes off this moth -
erfucking plane!") suggested by lay-
men in chat rooms. These changes 
resulted in an R rating instead of 
the originally intended PG -13, but 

COU RTESY OF NEW LINE CiNEMA 

Internet interest only increased. 
"Snakes" ftlmmakers have capitalized 
011 this fascination by offering a con-
test in which anyone can submit a 
song inspired by the title to be played 
during the closing credits. 

The entire movie takes place on a 
flight over the Pacific Ocean, where 
an assassin, hired to kill a witness 
in protective custody, releases a bag 
full of deadjy snakes. If it sounds 
ridiculous, that's because it's sup-
posed to; at least it's a truly original

sequels are the norm.

you might think that this dour critic has a hair up his ass for 

any music made after 1992, 
unless it has pre-verse sections in 
13/8 time or new devices of electro-

excuse to ignore this critic's musings 
regarding a little-known genre called 
pop punk. If this is the case, you are 
incorrect. When you're raised on the 
stuff, as any good SoCal boy should 
be, you tend to be more discerning 
than the usual Taking Back Sunday-

save for a song about Iraq - the 
no-nonsense lyrics written by an

feel -good. This is no depressing Bad

hold onto any elements of the "my

tus quo. Instead ie'S a catchy pop 
punk set that's got the basics: three 
chords, singable "oh oh" vocals and 
drums/guitar that fill the gaps when 
needed. But here, there's something 
that just works so right it puts all 
other pop punkers to shame. It 's 
immediate, enjoyable and for a little 
blast of time, will help you forget 
anything else. 

I admit that we all need a little pop 
punk sometimes, and this 4S-minute

forget the bad stuff and keep the sum -

find funny. All I know is that 
"Napoleon Dynamite" played 
more like a boringly realistic

and "Nacho Libre" looks no dif-
ferent - except this time it's like 
my autobiography. 

That is, friar/chef Ignacio (Jack

age in Mexico through moon-
lighting as a luchador, or profes-
sional wrestler. In the meantime, 
can he also put salads on the 
tables of poor children looking 
only for a bit of roughage? Can 
he use his newfound self-respect 
to learn a greater lesson in life? 
Can he win the heart of beauti-
ful Sister EncarnaciOn? I swear, 
it's like Jared (also director) and 
Jerusha Hess, the Mormon writers 
of "Dynarnite~ and Mike White, 
the bisexual writer of "The Good 
Girl" and "School of Rock;' only 
decided to team up after find -
ing the memoir I was working 
on. Hopefully, this supergroup 
of "oddball" comedian-types will 
produce something funnier than 
simply throwing an angry beehive

else I'll be forced to watch the pre-

Strike Back" wasn't exactly the culmi-
nation we might have hoped for. So 
we'll let him slide and make "Clerks 2" 
instead of banishing him to a land of 
regret and "Jersey Girl" sequels. 

"Clerks" may not have been . as 
funny as "Mallrats," as clever as 
"Dogma" or as smart as "Chasing 
Amy:' but Kevin Smith fans have a 
soft spot for the fLlm anyway. We were 
able to look past the terrible acting 
and identify with the characters in 

HIATUS 12 

COURTESY OF VIEW ASKEW 

one of the first films to capture the 
slacker generation in its true uncen -
sored stoner glory. 

"Clerks 2" follows Dante and 
Randall (Brian O'Halloran and Jeff 
Anderson, who hopefully spent the 
last 12 years in acting class) as they 
land jobs at burger joint Mooby's, of 
"Dogma" -massacre fame. They pretty 
much do the same stuff that you did if 
you've ever worked in fast food. Look 
out for Rosario Dawson, Jason Lee, 
Ben Affleck and Wanda Sykes, plus a 
donkey-show scene that promises to 
one-up the bathroom necrophilia of 
the original.

Paris, K-Fed, 
and a Nation of 
I.mpressionables 
~ STALEY, from page 8 
ter and another where a kid throws 
a pair of scissors at his obnoxious 
roommate. 

Unfortunately, television execs 
aren't the only people encouraging 
amoral, tasteless behavior - simply 
turn on MTV and watch one of the 10 
episodes of "Parental Control" played 
daily. In this act of genius, parents 
pick two potential suitors for their 
son or daughter in an attempt to rid 
themselves of the current significant 
other. Granted, none of these rela-
tionships are marriages, but that in 
no way justifies parents condoning 
infidelity. While much of this sup-
posed "reality" show is clearly script-
ed, there are some truly fucked-up 
moments in which the participants 
reveal their inner slut in front of not 
only their boyfriend or girlfriend, but 
also their parents. 

Perhaps this desire to be on televi-
sion acting like a dumb bitch (guy 
or girl) is spurred by our society's 
fascination with celebrities and their 
various relationships. When Brad Pitt 
is commended for his humanitar-
ian efforts after cheating on len, and 
Paris Hilton gets national attention 
every time she finds a new penis, 
what is our impressionable youth to 
think? Obsession with celebrities has 
gotten out of control, and shows like 
"Celebrity Eye Candy" and "Stranded 
With a Star" reveal how truly absurd 
this phenomenon has become. The 
former dedicates entire segments to 
montages of celebrities foUowing a 
certain theme, be it facial hair or talk-
ing on a ceU phone, while the latter 
provides us with a roundtable ofC-list 
celebrities tackling the tough ques-
tions, which go something like this: 
Who would you rather be stranded on 
an island with, Clay Aiken or Marilyn 
Manson? The priceless moments on 
this show occur when the so-called 
celebs actually argue passionately over 
the questions, like when John Salley 
chose K-Fed over Justin Tunberlalce 
(sigh). When did entertainment turn 
into a sixth -grade slumber party? 

There is obviously some educa-
tional television out there. with the 
National ~c Channel being 
one of the ' more consistently strong 
cable networks. Unfortunakly, Time 
Warner recently snatched that channel 
away from its faithful viewers. send-
ing sophisticated stoners like myself 
searching for new ways to couch-learn. 
The History Channel has apparendy 
caught on to the fact that people began 
referring to it as the Hider Channel, 
and has now begun showing footage 
from other horrendous wars. Could 
Pol Pot's genOCide be next? We should 
be so lucky. The Learning Channel and 
Weather Channel get into the fun as 
well, seemingly hell-bent OIl terrifying 
rather than enlightening the viewer . 
With shows like "It Could Happen 
Tomorrow" and "Mega-Disasters; 
viewers are confronted with the possi-
bility that Yellowstone may be a mega-
volcano, a meteor could end civiliza-
lion as we know it and a hurricane 
could hit New York City While I can't 
bring myself to change the channel 
when scenes of widespread devastation 
are shown, most of these shows fall 
into the "ignorance is bliss" . category 
rather than the "good to know" one. 

11 isn't hard to sit back as an 
armchair critic and pick out what's 
wrong with television, but it has 
become unacceptably difficult to 
find something good to watch. The 
best television requires the viewer to 
pay an extra SIO a month for HBO. 
Showtime also has some great shows 
- specifically "Huff" and "Weeds" 
- but only the 17 Americans who 
actually subscribe to Showtirne are 
aware of that. So what's my point? I 
guess I'm just annoyed that though 
television's tact. class and ethics have 
hit an all -time low. I still watch any-
way. Unfortunately, that doesn't really 
get us anywhere, but if you are watch-
ing television, you aren't really getting 
anywhere anyway, now are you?

18 SENIOR SENDOFF THE UCSD GUARDIAN THURSDAY, JUNE 8, 2006 

Hastci la Vista, Baby. 

Grant Schrader 
Editor in Chi8 

W hen I was a kid, baseball was my life. I was obsessed. It was just so easy to get caught up in the game - the infield drills, the home run derbies, 
the cookie breaks. Oh yes, the cookie breaks. (My dad the 
psychologist coach introduced them to reward us for hustling 
- operant conditioning at its frnest) In hindsight, though, I 
realize that what I enjoyed most about it was just being part 
of a team; there's a certain sense of belonging that only a team 
can instill, and I craved it. After shoulder surgery my fresh-
man year of high school ended my promising baseball career, 
it was· apparent to me that I had to find another venue of 
camaraderie to satisfy my fix .. 

Enter my high school newspaper. There, I learned that 
newspaper staffs and teams are virtually synonymous. Yes, 
both share the friendship opportunities as weD as that 
competitive element, but most basically, both are groups 
of people working together to accomplish some common 
goal, be it producing a win or a paper. 

The GUlJrdian staff is a team. And not just when we're 
playing sloshbaU against the ironically named Koala - the 
aboriginal word for "no drink" (seriously). We are a tightly 
knit and driven bunch, each member as willing as the next to 
do what it takes to improve the paper. Without that tenacity, 
completely redesigning the newspaper or upgrading the Web 

site would have been impossible, a fdct that makes this editor 
in chief ooze with pride. 

Now that I face the end of my tenure, I'm reminded of 
the advice I was given upon taking office: "Leave the paper 
better than how you found it." Thanks to all of you, I can 
confidently say that we did 

To Vlad, the human incarnation of both Pinky and the 
Brain, I have no doubts of your success in this world; I just 
hope we're always on the same side. lan, I truly admire 
your passion, drive and talent I would love to have you as a 
professor any time. You guys revolutionized the managing 
editor roles this year, and the GUlJrdian is all the better for 
it. Thank you. 

Heather, my copy child, I only wish I could be around 
to witness firsthand all the great things I know you will 
accomplish next year. Charles, keep your head up, playa. 
You're a valuable asset to this paper. Andrew, I always enjoy 
our golf games. I'll miss them. Marianne, your perverted 
humor never ceases to entertain. You can learn sex with 
me anytime, BABY. Matt, keep on laughing, bud. Hanna, I 
still don't have a flop. Cody, I know I can always count on 
you for a good conversation and laugh. And beer. GaeDe, 
I can honestly say that my coDege career would have been 
incomplete had I not met you. Don't think I've forgotten 

about that "Harry Potter" test. Study up! Christine, you 
sound like an Aussie to me. Christine and Marnette, you 
had the thankless job of reforming a section this year. Your 
touches have truly made aU the difference for Focus. Rael, 
we'D settle this on the golf course, punk. Danai, one day 
you'D realize that Marin kids kick ass. Nathan, you're the 
old man, now. Take care of the Iittle'uns. Billy, go U.S.A. 
Alex, you can be in my foursome anytime. Riley, it's never 
easy introducing a new position. You did a great job. Josh, 
thank you for working hard to transform the Web site this 
year. It shows. Na-TASHA, like it or not, you'D always be a 
sand crab to me. Richard, we should aU aspire to draw penis 
like you. Greg, good luck on that LSAT, man. Utako, what 
have I been saying aU along, you're completely irresistible. 

Mike and Michael, thank you both for bearing with us 
through the many changes. It's nice knOwing we have sup-
port in the business office. Lori, thank you for everything 
you have done for us. Good luck with your venture into 
intellectual stimulation. 

If you aren't on this list, it's not lOr lack of caring. It's for lack 
of space. That being said, what kind of editor in chief would I 
be if I didn't take this opportunity to admonish the future staff. 
Never aUow youndves to be fuUy satiJfied with the qua\ity of 
the GUiJrditm. ~ is the enemy of progrea.

ings. When someone brings our wisdom into 
question, we get offended before stopping to 
consider whether they have a point. 

And I'm not just talking about newspaper 
types. 

It's a cornerstone of the human condition: 
I exist, therefore my existence is correct. As 
the years add up, it gets harder to completely 
que tion the decisions we make - and zoom-
ing up to that brick window called the "real 
world" only turns on the saccharine self-
reflection juices, narcotizing us into thinking 
even less critically than usual. 

But hiding from the truth only stunts our 
potential, and we live in a world that plays 
too much peek-a-boo. If there's one thing I 
want to have contributed to the Guardian 
and its readers, it's a willingness to look our-
selves in the mirror and ask what we could 
do better as journalists, citizens, consumers 
and humans. I've been extremely fortunate 
to share these pale offices with people who 
supp lied desire to improve in equal amounts 
with talent and drive. In the two years I've 
sat on the Executive Board, the Guardian 
has undergone nothing less than total revo-
lution, and I hope that this Dew philosophy 
of progress sticks to its members like dried 
ink. 

Everyone at this university benefits from 
the presence of a good newspaper, yet few 
appreciate the very personal costs of pro-
ducing one. Especially considering the vast 
improvements to the paper this year, Grant, 
the UCSD community owes you a fat kiss 

ALEXANDER VARONO/GUARDIAN 

on the big toe. What the Guardian staff owes 
you, apart from a lot of piz~, beer and gaso-
line, is harder to name. But you've been an 
editor and a chief of the highest excellence, 
a confident leader with a natural feeling for 
what needed to change and what deserved 
to stay the same. I just hope we can still hit 
the green when you're a big-shot New York 
lawyer. 

Last year's EIC coined the "Force of 
Nature" handle for Vlad, but he wasn't around 
to see how much more appropriate it became. 
Attempting to list everything I have to thank 
you for would be an absurd task, so I'll just 
say this: I'm humbled, proud and endlessly 
grateful to have you as a friend, because being 
your opponent would be too fuckin' hard. It's 
been a joy to see you open up this year, and 
I hope it continues. And I' U miss your mom 
so much. 

Cody, Gaelle and Christine: I know you 
know this, but you put my beloved Hiatus to 
shame, goddamnit (and I'm certain Simone 
and Jia will, too). Thanks for keeping the best 
the best. 

Charles: Trust me, growing up is overrat-
ed - humor and humility make happiness. 
Keep an eye out for shitty headlines. 

To the Design crew: putting shit on pages 
is capital! Do it sexy always! 

To sports twins: No, I don't get it, but 
thanks for understanding. At least we can 
agree on a great city. 

Lastly, lowe my co-conspiring brown-
eyed girl a lot of gratitude and Golden Spoon. 
Thanks, Lindsay, for understanding why I 
had to tweak headlines and pound out arti-
cles late into what seemed like every night. 
But thanks most of all for being the best at 
what my unjustifiably arrogant ass needs 
most: a good critic. I stUl have a lot of ques-
tions about life, but I know that you are one 
completely correct answer. 

A year ago, when the last Guardian pro-duction of the year roUed around, I was hard at work on my first issue while 
Clayton, the ex-editor in chief, sat in my brand-
new office, drinking heavily and listening to The 
Moon and Antarctica - that's Modest Mouse 
and you should have it, you morons. (Last one!) 
I thought I understood then what sort of experi-
ence he was going through, but here I am a year 
later, with only a single year of Guardian editor-
ship under my belt (it's a few notches bigger than 
it once was) and I can realize just how sad that 
day must have been for him. 

So here I am. I hated on a Fall Fest, 
WinterFest and a Sun God - not because I 
especially wanted to, but because it had to be 
done (thanks Associated Students!), I recom-
mended a year's worth of good-ass albums, 
I got to see movies and theater for free and 
I got to tell everyone about it, but somehow 
that wasn't the best part. The best part was the 
drinking, for sure. 

GREG DALE/GUARDIAN 

One day, I woke up and I was apparently 
graduating. I was no longer a Muir newbie, 
meeting the greatest network of extended 
friends that I could imagine. (Thanks, J-House! 
Thanks, the cliffs!) I was no longer enjoying 
san'wichees, being stoned and playing rock 'n' 
roll in my garage in University City. (Thanks, 
George Chow!) I was no longer helping -
with the almighty Governator foursome - to 
throw some of the greatest house parties yet 
to exist. (Thanks, anyone who has attended a 
Governator party, where the beer is good, the 
music is jumpin' and the girls are smokin' - or 
really drunk - or maybe it's just me.) And yes, 
I was no longer doing whatever the hell else I 
did this year other than live in my office at the 
Guurdian. How did I get here? Letting the days 
go by? Something like that. 

This place has been great to me, and I'm 
pretty confident that I've been gmt right back

group of .experienced college students.- Four 
years later,l'm still smal.I. but I can now say that 
I am among the GI44I1'IIian "veterans'- LooIcing 
back, one thing's for sure - I've had a lot of 
fun, found some good friends and learned 
more than I can imagine along the way. 

It all started freshman year and during one 
of the meetings with the news editor, I said that 
I didn't qUod writing at least one story a week. 
WeD. I got my wish. I was assigned a beat. 
found out more about the Price Center expan-
sion than I wanted to, became an editorial 
asaIstant and was pu1 of a team that cowred 
that year's A.S, elections, And what an electlon 
that was! The GlMnIiIm WII IWirIed into A.S. 
elections dnma mil I fouad out that being a 
journalist ___ you probably won't become 
frienda with It was then that also I 

~ a role to play 
in that are impOrtant to 
me and my community. 

Sophomore year I became the usociate 
News editor. I transformed myself into a mas-
ter multHaaker - trying to be at different 
places and doing a millioo diffa-ent things at 
once. I have never wrIttm so much in my life. 
It was a challenge and I needed a break. The 
next year, I wrote only a few ItDries when I 
got back from srudylng in SpaIn. But I hid an 
addiction to the GIItIftIUM and I couldn't stop. 
My senior year, I jumped in u UIOdate Pocus

So here I am, about to say my last goodbyes 
and I'm still in diJbelie(. To those who sup-
ported me along the way, even though some of 
you might have taken a badcseat to production 
days. I truly thank you. To the K -\\ roomies

mesaages left by "Evan from the GUlirdian;' 
I will always have you guys in my heart. To

have been there for me throughout my college 
career, I couldn't have done it without your 
support. To Evan and Gai!lle, my two former 
bosses, thanks for the many, many, many sto-
ries that you made me write. To Christine, you 
did an awesome job this year and I know that 
Focus will U~ on. Thanks for listening to all

writers, thanks for your hard work.. 

To Vlad, Ian and Grant: Thank you for 
challenging each and every one ~f us to push 
the boundaries. I can't wait to see what each of 
you all will do next. 1b my family, mom, Carla, 
Mario and Courtney: Thanks for making me 
laugh and being there for me when I cry. To my 
dad, who told me to "focus" (crazy how it all 
ties together), I miss you and I take your words 
with me wherever I go. To next year's executive 
board (a special shoutout to Hanna!), I wish 
you all the best of luck; I know each of you will 
do a great job.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Marianne Madden 
Opinion Editor 

I didn't do much journalism in high school. I didn't do much in college, either. Sure, [ wrote plen-
ty of stories. a few of them decent. 
But mostly I made snarky comments 
about other people's stories ("edit-
ing.- in industry parlance), endlessly 
joked about photocopying my ass and 
asked where the beer was. 

One of the major things ] learned 
over these years is that people love to 
write me angry letters. I'm still not 
sure why. 

Sure, I knew what I was getting 
into when I poked fun at sorority girls, 
engineering students, Scientologists, 
computer science majors, SoCaI driv-
ers and MySpace users. But even when 
someone wasn't openly ridiculed or 
marginalized in my columns, they 
seemed to take a righteous stance. 
"You're here to make me laugh," I 
read (between the lines) in their e-
mails. "And even if [ have to make 
you weep through a hateful e-mail, 
goddamnit, you're going to make me 
laugh." Apparently, UCSD students 
subscribe to the school of thought that 
says if you antagonize a humor col-
umnist enough, she will generate bril-
liant material tailored to your sense of 
humor. (Unfortunately, il doesn't work. 
Enough angry letters, and I simply 

avoid my computer for a few dayL) 
At ti/1le$, our little school seemed 

like an existential hell. On plenty of 
days I dragged myself to work. c1ass or 
an appointment with spite, angry that 
iii even wokrn up that day. 

And at other times, like lately, I 

e of the major 
things I learned over 

these years is that 
people love to write 
me angry letters. rm 
still not sure why?' 

smell the honeysuckle blooming. feel 
the sun on my shoulders and can't help 
but grin. The feeling of accomplish-
menl is wonderful - but so is the real-
ization that after working my ass off 
for four years in the anxious confines 
of a newspaper office, I'm off the hook. 
No more waking up on Saturdays to 
edit stories; no more Sunday morn-
ing phone calls; no more fOCUSing for 
so many hours that my eyes feel like 
they've been coated with honey; no 
more screwed-up pull quotes, weak

IUJIlI1lmIs or torturowIy long produc-
tions. 

And no more fantastic memo-
ries. Despite my legendary kvetching. 
working for the GlUlrdian was an 
absolute blast. What other job would 
have me lunging for my notebook at 
3 a.m. as an idea struck? Or attack-
ing Charles with unwanled hugs? Or 
replying to sweet e-mai1s from read-
ers when my work had brightened 
their days? 

For more than a year, I resisted 
being fully assimilated into the 
Guardian group. signing them off as a 
bunch of &onomist-toting darks. Well, 
that was my own loss. Who wouIda 
thunk that college joumalists were a 
blast to hang out with and to learn 
from? I love you aU and will truly miss 
working with you. 

The Guardian had amazing lead-
ership this year; if I ever have bosses 
half as cool as lan, V1ad and Grant,

career. And to Hanna - you came 
from nowhere and completely blew us 
all away; Heather, Nathan and Natasha 
- best ofluck next year. I know you'll 
kick ass . • 

Thanks for the laughs, everybody:

so I'm not reaUy leaving. Through a set of weird circumstances, in addition to being a one-quarter super-senior next year, I'll also 
be the interim Focus editor. Does that make this 
about the lamest send off ever? I think it does. But 
I'm going to try to do it better than I might if I 
was really getting the hell out of Dodge. 

A few weeks from finishing my current posi-
tion here, aU I can think about is how much fun I 
had, how much I love the people and how I wish 
I had found this office earlier in coUege. How 
bare-ass stupid I was for not applying three years 
ago when I considered doing it. How great it is 
to fmd people who can match any weirdness I 
throw at them and then up the anle. 

If you're reading this and you don't have some 
sort of on-campus job, club, organization or 
whatever to go to, go out and do it. How many 
people have to teU you that you're only hurting 
yourself bY not doing it? Go fmd something, any-
thing (except the I.D.E.A. dub), because I haven't 
read anyone else's sendoff, but I bet they aU say 
the same thing: I wish I could have more time 
here with these people. A spur -of-the-moment 
decision (that mayor may not bite me in the ass 
later) bought me more time, and I'm masochisti· 
caUy happy for it. 

To the ones not so lucky: Marianne, you 
tried to mess with my mind from the moment 
I applied, and continued in the year and a half 
since. Thanks for playing in this sandbox with 
me, even if you always made me do it at 10 a.m. 
on a Sunday, and sometimes threw sand at me. 
Nathan and Natasha, just know that she left me 
delailed instructions on what I was to do to you 
both if the Opinion section compromises the

impeccable joumalistic and editorial standards 
we set aU year long. Watch your backs is aU I'm 
saying. 

Ian and Vlad: When we sucked you made 
. sure we knew it, and since you pretty much never 
did anything badly except miss a copy dead-
line or two, if youii asked me to use the words 
"chimpanzee:' "underpants» and "troglodyte" in 
the same headline, I probably would have tried 
my level best to do it. The work you did was 
so invaluable, and you earned aU the respect us 
peons often didn't give you. 

Grant, I don't have a due what it is you 
have thai kept the place on an even keel , but it's 
money, whatever it is. We couldn't have done half 
so much without you reading over our shoulders, 
and when I look at old papers I can barely believe 
how far you brought us. 

Christine and Marnette, if you leave me alone 
to do this thing I'll hunt you down, don't think I 
won't Seriously, I'm glad to be doing Focus if for 
no other reason than to keep in touch with you 
both a while longer. I'm only sorry I can't give 
you more than 10 weeks with the section yoo 
worked so hard on aU year. 

Cody, I'm listening to the Velvet Underground. 
You've made a difference in the world. Gaelle, I 
only wish I could've met you' earlier, you never 
fail to be interesting to talle to. Just remember 
that I said so when I show up at your door in 
France one day. 

Angie, I miss talking soccer with you. No 
one else gives a damn. Alex, I appreciate having 
someone around to relive the not-so-glory days 
of debate with. 

So long guys. and thanks for aU the laughs. 

A couple requests before I get aU mushy. Pint, enoush with the waiting in the doorway 10 minutes before your c1ass 
starts so you cauae a bil traffic jam. Are you try-
ing to get good seats? No dass Is that good, sorry. 
You're probably just going to talk on A.I.M. the 
whole time anyway. Speaking of which, ~ hey 
laptop-anime-during-Iecture-kid: Go enjoy life! 
You're going to get a "C" whether you come to 
class or not, so why not be drinking beers at the 
beach instead of distracting us with your crap? 
It's hard enough to pay attention in a 3OO-seat. 
200-degree lecture hall as it is. 

And if you haven't been to the cliffs by the 
end of this year, you should be kicked out. No 
joke. It's a six-minute walk from Pacific Hall, so 
you can go on your one-hour break. Beats any-
thing you could accomplish in the library in an 
hour. I promise. 

lowe a lot of my best UCSD experiences to 
the cliffs, so I hope that extremely hoppable night 
gate doesn~t discourage anyone from going, espe-
cially for meleor showers or bioluminescence. 

Moving off campus? New rule: no living 
around UTC as a senior. Yes it's convenient, but 
riO it's not cheaper and no it's not cool and no 
you can't claim to have lived in San Diego if the 
only public transponation you've ever laken is 
the Cityshuttle. There are people in Maine who 
would give both kidneys just to live in P.B. for 
a year. 

Thanks to anyone who ever gave me feed -
back on stories, illustrations or comics. If I've 
learned one thing through working for a paper, 
it's that if you see something you like (or don't), 
the five seconds it takes to tell the author can 
really make someone's day (or at the least let 
them know you're reading). 

The other thing I've leamed is that despite the 
piss-poor pay, getting an on~campus job is about 
the smartest thing you can do as a UCSD stu-
dent. After years of lucrative restaurant slavery, I 
never anticipated how rewarding it would be to 
have some sort of spot (or two) on campus to call 
home. Thanks to Zarin, Gretchen and everyone 
at campus tours for giving me an excuse to rock 
the blue polo in classes, at the pub and in other 
inappropriate places. You guys are the shit. 

Thanks to the awesome A.S. SafeRide drivers, 
and thanks to aU the UCSD shuttle drivers except 
the ones who play smooth jazz. (You think it's 
relaxing? Reggae is relaxing. Classical is relaxing. 
Smooth jazz just sucks.) 

Thanks to the MQ and the CDlifornia Review 
for always giving me a good laugh between class-
es (the first time I read these papers I thought 
they were for real!). 

Thank you Josh the RSO for writing me up 
so many times. You taught me a valuable lesson 
about life and responsibility. Just kidding. Next 
time I see you I'm punching you in your fat, 
ugly face. 

Thanks 10 our awesome Guardian illustrators 
this year; Ben, Roy, Charlie, Jennifer- you guys 
are all amazing. Jenn I'm thrilled to be leaving 
the job in such good hands. And to the rest of 
the Guardian crew- thanks for giving me the 
chance 10 do something [love 'and call it a job. 
It's been an honor. 

Just remember, your parents said "be safe" 
not "be boring." To anyone who ever came to a 
Governator party (and didn't steal our hookah): 
You rock. Hit me up if YOIJ want the jungle juice 
recipe. And to my kickass roommates, J-house, 
every spring break crew, and the pub; the last 4 
years pretty much haven't sucked at all Thanks.

The "Sound of Music" scared me as a kid. "The Hills Are Alive" inspired nightmares of ravenous, razor-toothed, living hills 
stampeding through San Jose to gobble up chil-
dren. I'm over that now, but I still hate the "Sound

Even so, -These are a few of my fa-\'O-rite

Mario. Although he never left the building. Shigeru

Photo Editor 

Alexander Varoild 
Associate Photo Editor 

Tell your story like you are a pokemon" is the advice I just got from my ever-so-helpful associate editor, Alex. I 
don't know what that's supposed to mean, 
but I doubt repeating my name 500 times 
fo r my sendoff will work. Thanks for the 
thought, though. 

Being an editor pretty much guarantees 
the second floor of the old Student Center 
becomes your default on -campus destination 
of choice. I'll miss this office, the random 
craziness and all the people that make it hap-
pen . Editors: It's been fun working with all of 
you. T hanks for putting up with my absence 
on Sundays. Photographers: I'm proud to 
say that your hard work has set the standard 
for the photo department higher than it has 
ever been . Thank you for all your hard work. 
Alex: Am I glad I interviewed a super-senior. 
You've been more than an awesome associ-
ate, but a great friend as well . 

To Helga, Humphrey, Olga, Horace, 
Oscar, Spencer, Percy, Bertha and Marvin, 
I'll never forget the memories we shared in 
Mongolia. 

Seniors, you have been a tremendous 
blessing in my life: I wouldn't trade anything 
in the world for the three years we shared. I 
apologize in advance for not being to able to 
mention all of you due to space constraints. 
Coming up with a sentence or two for each of 
you on the spot is not easy, so bear with me. 

Keppel, my roommate: Thanks for putting 
up with all my quirks and for keeping me 
accountable. Ervin: It's so encouraging to see 
your willingness to invest in people's lives. 
Derek, the ultimate weapon: I admire your 
unwavering convictions. Syckie: It's time for 
you to live up to your screen name. 

Anna the "Winner": Your childlike joy is

infectious. Are you ever going to finish that 
tllrtlc? Carisa , who to this day has no recol-
lection of welcoming me to AACF: I have no 
doubt you'll be a blessing to everyone you'll 
meet in Kenya. Tiffers: You have such a 
teachable heart. You're a fun one! Kimmy, my 
fellow Excel lover: J really respect your will -
ingness to serve so selflessly. Rides to school 
just aren't the same without you. Sharlene: 
Slab the Killer + Volcanic is known as the 
"Shar" after Ensenada. Darlene: You're so 
caring and always thinking about others! 

Paul Chen: Don't say anything stupid and 
get kicked off the team on your bike ride to 
SO. Kau : Make your cross-country adven-
ture happen! Hase: J admire your openness 
and they way you're convicted by the Word. 
William Whitford: Don't break things. I'll 
see ya up north. Mascot: J want to see you 
kill a cow. With your bare hands. And eat 
it. 

Melanie: I love the way you always greet 
everyone with a smile. Diman: No stealing 
kids; you have to get your own. We're still not 
making much of a dent to Screwtape, sadly. 
Pheebs: Where will I run into you next? 

Boyce: You have such an amazing heart 
for outreach! Steph: I love how we can act 
like total dorks around each other. Kelly: 
Mother! I'm glad we like each other now. 
I've been incredibly blessed to witness your 
growth since I've met you. Lila: You are a 
lot nicer than you think. I'm glad to have a 
friend like you. 

Mom and Benny: Thanks for always being 
there for me. I love you guys. Dad: I miss you 
so much. J wish you were here to share this 
with me. 

It's been an amazing four years, San Diego. 
I'm going to miss you. 

Photography is my excuse to engage the things around me. When my camera is slung over my ~lOulder, I'm inclined 
to look a bit harder, think a second longer or 
explore a few feet farther. The world is stunning 
when it is broken up, perfectly framed and just 
the way you want it. However ridiculous this 
sounds ... it's not stop and smell the roses; it's 
stop and snap the shutter. 

If you've ever wanted to get into photography 
- do it; do it now. Forget the iPod; opt for the 
cheaper Dell; spare the eight or 18 pack ... the 
point is: Get together the ~ilIs and buy yourself 
a camera. Take pictures now so you can have the 
memories later. 

I was a photographer and the associate Photo 
editor. I wound up here - at the Guardian - in 
my super-senior year. I only worked at this paper 
for something like 24 weeks but nonetheless 1 
had a blast. 

I am thankful to my editC)(', Billy, for giv-
ing me a chance, supporting me and beco'ln-
ing a true friend. Our staff produced the best 
Guardian photos ever. J(J \ike to extend special 
thanks to Greg Dale, who was the de facto 
associate Photo editor and never failed to come 
through. At the end of the day, I can say without 
a trace o(hesitation that I am tru1y proud of the 
exceptional work we have done. 

I'm indebted to my mentors Danny Cantrell 
and Brandy Brickey. Both of them have been 
there since the first day out on Marshall Lawn. 
They taught me that all that reaUy matters is the 
number of lives at the bottom of the tlow. UCSD 
Speech and Debate forever. BMES rocked my 

Christine Clark 

ALEXANDER VARONOICUIoIWlloN 

socks. To the Historian Committee - Chang. 
Fan, Lin, Kwan, Go, Velasquez - wOOl! Yeah 
Sweetness. Sam, Derek. Kyle, Joost, Arch, Grant, 
Maheiden, you guys are core. Thanks for being 
such an amazing girlfriend, Alice. 

Once, when I wasn't paying attention, Vlad 
kissed me on the neck. You know the feeling 
murderers have when they're trying to dean 
blood off their hands? They want to get rid of 
the blood so badly that they don't stop scrubbing 
their hands until they're raw and bloody. Well, 
yeah, that's kinda how Vlad made me feel. He 
robbed me of my innocence. His kiss seared my 
flesh and I washed my neck until it bled, practi-
cally. Thanks VIad. 

Management, you kids were ridiculous. If 
I were to set sail to land with a million soon-
to-be-slave natives, J(J appoint you guys as my 
henchmen. When we're SO, Grant better have a 
baseball bat for a cane, Ian better be sporting the 
pink anti-embolism socks and VIad better be the 
professor wearing assIess leather chaps. Sports 
and News better still be tokin Copy will be the 
nit-picking and blind folks. Cody and Hiatus will 
be singing praise for AshIee Simpson's lifetime 
achievement album. Opinion will still, well, not 
have a decent opinion. Design will be still be the 
same old assholes - cropping my photos. And 
Christine and Mamette will be the ones getting 
freaky on the Senior Center's dance floor - but 
in style. 

To Mom, Dad, Marisa and Grandma, thank 
you so much for supporting me through these 
five years. You are the most important people in 
my lives and I love you very much. 

Associate Hiatus Editor 

BilLY WONC/CUloltDIIIN 

T here is a lot I am going to miss about UCSD. I'm going to miss: skate-
boarding to class, taking drama class-
es, the ocean views from RIMAe, 
Hari Krishna's curry, J.P. Gorin's lec-
tures ... a lot. But in truth, I will 
miss working at the Guardian the 
most. Yes, I get misty eyed when I 
think that my days of working at 
the GUQrdian 'till the wee hours of 
the morning, for little money, are 
over. I rarely felt the monotony of a 
hard day's work because during those 
never-ending production days. I was 
in the company of some of the smart-
est, funniest anil dosgone it, nicest 
people on campus. 

As an associate Hiatus editor 
(and self-confessed movie nerd), I 
worked in a job with lOme major 
pecka. I got to write about movies, 
talk about movies and SO to movies 
(for free) . And the music? Needl_ 
to say, working at Hiatus spift'ed up 
my iPod in many ways. Now, every 
time I hear the aouncb of The Go! 
Team, Of Montreal, Sharon Jon~ and 

Amadou et Mariam, it will remind 
me of the many houn I spent at the 
Guardian, where I laughed, chatted 
and managed to do little work, too. 

Working at the Guardian was 
more time-consuming than I expect-
ed, but luckily it never felt like work. 
The reasons are numerous (I have 
listed a couple above), but my year 
at the Guardian was so memorable 
primarily because of two people: 
Cody and Gaflle. I had a great time 
collaborating with both of you - I 
felt very lucky to work with two 
people who are 10 talented. fun and 
easygoing. 

There are many who my year 
at the Guardia" a blast, 10 hear's a 
quick about out to a few: Matt, your 
laugh it infectious, Marianne, I love 
your wicked. wicbd sense of humor 
and Charles, listening to your IPod 
was urn ... interesting. But, to all 
those Hiatus writers, those faithful 
few (I mean few) who wrote the 
stories, came to the meetings and 
drank beer with the editoR, I 1lIIY 
thank you. 

Leaving Hiatus is bittersweet, but 
I know the section will be in more-
than-capable hands - Simone, your 
influence on Hiatus this year was 
invaluable and 1 can't wait to see 
what you and Jia accomplish next 
year. 

OK, this sendoff has officially 
gotton sappy, but I can admit that 
not everything about the Guard",,, 
was peachy. There were times where 
the messy office, crap pay and long 
hours wore on me, but fortunately 
those times were few and far between 
(I'm getting sappy again). 

I learned a lot working for Hiatus 
this year - I learned that if you are 
going to go to the movies, it should 
be at • landmark theater, and if you 

_ are going to watch TV. it should be 
HBO and if you're going to listen to 
music, it ahould ... well, I'll let Cody 
talk to you about that. I could go 
OIl, but my word count II min&.' 10 
before J go I must thank all the staff 
at the GII4IRIi4In. You aD make sayiq 
goodbye a hard thinS to do - you 
butarcb!

Angie Lin 
Associate Sports 
Editor 

A s the year rolls to an end, I have to say, it's been far too fun and too fast of a journey 
through college. But with all good 
things, it must come to an end, thus 
two words: PAZ AFUERA! There 
are many people I have been so 
grateful to for having graced me 
with their presence throughout my 
three-year tenure here. First off, to 
those I've met through my columns 
that have given me either inspira-
tion/more crap to write another col-
umn, thank you for giving me the 
time of day to put in my two cents. 
To my best friends and constant 
companions, Meggie and Nikkie: 
SUPER - gracias para all the advice, 
trash-talking on sports and rides to 
school (fine, I'll leave my kids alone 
enough with you for you to play bus 
driver) - for all of which I wiIJ not 
leave you with ugly bridesmaids' 
dresses at my wedding and ELFIE 
- you only suck WHAT?! Yo essa, 
thank you for the constant shoul-
der, the inside jokes and for sharing 
with me this infectious laughter 
that we have become known for. 
1 couldn't have asked for a better 
other half around school and may 
math VIVE SIEMPRE! Anthony, 
thank you for trying to stay on top 
of the game so that you could pick 
my mind. You have been everything 
I've needed and I thank you for 
sticking with a girl who sometimes 
has more testosterone than some of 
your buddies - I'll never forget you 
cooking, me watching basketball 
and the, "Angie, for fear of sound-
ing like a woman, do you want 

your Corona?" Thank you to the 
Guardian for making my year com-
plete toiling away on Wednesday 
and Sunday nights - from all the 
annoying copy reads to the "This 
article sucks!" When I look back 
and remember Charles' red-faced 
Michael Jackson moves. Rael jerk-
ing off to our favorite posters and 
my favorite designers Andrew, 
Utako and Richard tOiling away to 
try to make the back page look 
"cool," I remember why I did it again 
(besides for those business cards). 
Joyce (my boyfriend and marathon 
trooper), Tiffers (my beloved room-
mate - yo, you hungry?!), Jayyyy 
(our talks are too good, and I'm 
glad to have found such a good 
friend), Kirfestivities, Pha (who 
would have thought our friendship 
would blossom into incest?), Sophia 
(my lover since day one), Larry and 
the boyz of Crypto, Alex, Candace, 
Don, Daniel, Jimmy, Todor, Yvonne, 
Alpha Iota, all my Lynbrookians, 
those that lived their lives in S&E 
and everyone else I couldn't include: 
Thank you for making me who I am 
today. On another note: Boo to all 
ignorant sports lovers and band-
wagoneers. Don't get too butthurt 
with each hating comment on your 
favorite team because they're defi-
nitely never going to end. Last but 
not least, for those who have ever 
had doubts in the Phoenix Suns: 
I say just wait for next year! We're 
coming back for the hampionships! 
And may Barkley live on in aLI of 
your hearts! 

Peace.

THUllSDAY, JUNE 8, 2006 THE UCSD GUARDIAN SENIOR SENDOfF 29 

Cody B. Nabours Throws Nods MicheUe Tsai 
• CODY, from page 20 
to it. Somehow, the idea of being continuously 
(and sometimes painfully) single for four years, 
existing in a constant marijuana and alcohol 
stupor and talking late into the midnight hours 
about the philosophy of rock 'n' roU wouldn't 
sound like the best way to spend four years and 
my parents' money, but it turned out pretty all 
right, I must say. 

Now for shout outs: 
Ian: For your job, and the company of a 

fellow music mensch and Cancer, thartk you. 
Riley: For making me go to parties, thank you. 
Pat: For someone to talk calculus with over a 
blunt, thank you. Mike: For the funniest man 
alive award, with honorable mentions to Pez, 
Cannon and Trevor, I thank you. Roy: For 
every word spoken after 3 a.m. with cig in 
hand, thanks. Utako: For making me realize 

just how incredibly awesome (as in "makes 
me full of awe") a cool and attractive gal 
who's also a nerd can be, thank you. GaiUe: 
I was once too much of a cynic to believe 
that the world could produce people like you 
- in fact, sometimes, I still don't believe it. 
Christine: Thanks for making my life vastly 
more hilarious than I could make it myself. 
Thanks, both of you, for saving my ass repeat-
edly with your hard work, Grant: My fellow 
170 bro, it's too bad you always have to play 
the straight man, but you're so good at it. And 
Charles: Read again t~e part that says · pain-
fully Single" and don't do that so much - it 
helps to talk to the girls. I think. 

If you're someone I throw a nod to as I walk 
by, thanks to you, too. I can't name you in such 
space, but I'm pretty sure I love you for some 
reason or other.

M an, this place is a snore:' That was so four years ago. You must think I am crazy, but I flew back to Palo 
Alto every two to three weeks or so fall quarter 
of freshman year. I wanted out. People always 
commented how great the weather was and I 
felt that that was all there was to this so-called 
America's Finest City. Living in the apartments 
at Earl Warren College instead of the suites felt 
like I was doomed to isolation from the rest of 
SOciety in an already ridiculously anti-social and 
nerdy school. 

Daniel Watts Says Goodbye to' UCSD 

Fast forward two and a half years later - I 
love San Diego. Enter my shag van. the two 
greatest, most sexy roommates any girl can wish 
for, a valid 10, the best job ever at Sepbora and 
my cat Scratchy who went skydiving off the bal-
cony a month ago (she landed fLne). r even came 
to love this nerdy school and the people in my 
life that came with it.

absolutely everything imaginable and ittillg at 
the beach all night until 7 a.m. only to get 10 work 
by 9 a.m. and class later in the afternoon, peeing 
under the steps. Shoot, what you know about 
being a trooper? Theresa: When the beats come 
a rockin; don't come a knockin'! ·OH MY GOD 
JOE!" We will move to NYC together one day. 
Movie dates, dinner dates, gelato dates, to be con-
tinued. Wreaking havoc behind the wheels with 
you and jeanis. Vegas spring break 2006: Brian 
getting booby slapped into vertigo by a stripper, 
an image which will forever be ingrained in my 
memory along with all of us who were there that 
night. sixty dollars for a limo? We swore we were 
celebrities. Christina, can you make anymore 
loops around the parking lot? Haha! FERGIE!! 
"I'm sooooo drunk. I'm sooooo sick. KUNK!" 
Karen: Eric Kyner days are over. Thank God no 
more fobs. Vegas Part Deuce! See you in the Yay 
Area! To everyone else that ) have nothing but 
love for: Thank you for all the memories! 

• WATTS, from page 23 
Koala's lilce a fraternity that murders you if you 
try to quit. I declined to join, backed away slow-
ly, and stuck with the Guardian, which paid me, 
and which most students weren't embarra<>Sed to 
read in public. 

From my first campus visit - when a tour 
guide told me Geisel was Sinking and UCSD 
owned six radio stations - I've loved this school, 
flaws and all. Every part ofit. Every student, every 
administrator, every faculty member, without 
exception: from Lara Pham to Steve "the porn 
guy" York to Darth Watson; from SRTV's Uiga to 
wcrVs Bielich; from communists Harish and 
Matt Corrales to Republican guru Vince Vasquez 
and "the right-wing girl" jocelyn Hsiao; Price 
Center Dancing Girl (wherever the hell she's been 
this year) and the leotard -clad nutcase who thinks 
he's an alien; all three Kevin Hsus and both semi-
presidential jeremys; and my favorite professor,

the man for whom I have boundless personal and 
professional respect, Victor Magagna. The people 
make UCSD what it is. 

UCSD's also what you make of it. Be proud to 
be UCSD, where you were prepared not for a life 
where every day is a Sun God Festival, but rather 
for reality, where life isn't delivered on a silver 
planer, but where you have to go out and grab it 
for yourself. 

Unplug your i.Pod and holster your cell phone. 
If you must cling to something dectronic, make it 
a video camera You'U love life more when you're 
paying attention. UCSD can give you whatever 
you want - if only you look. I looked for it, I 
fou nd it, and I got everything I asked for and 
more. _ 

The Guardian's election endorsements got it 
right this year: · We strongly believe that no one 
loves UCSD more than Watts." I strongly believe 
that no one ever will. 

I feel blessed to have completed my education 
here at UCSD, which is listed seventh best pUblic 
university by U.S. News & World Report if you 
all don't already know. I really don't have school 
spirit and for those of you who don't either, be 
proud of your school for at least this much! 

Without the select few in my life who made 
my college experience complete. UCSD would 
be dead to me. It's not just about digging your 
noses in your books and smelling like the library. 
You ultimately will get stuff done. Loosen up and 
have some fun. Amuse yourself. Order Bronx 
Pizza. Ask for the hunky Mark when you go to 
P.B. Bar & Grill. 

Take a "Mygagnuts" class, he's the best pro-
fessor ever. You will not be disappointed. Tan 
your pastiness - really, it makes you that much 
more sexy.

Make up to a FULL QUARTER in tuition in an AFTERNOON of work! 

My name is Steve York, and as a recent UCSD alumni I realize fun sexual 
expression is a staple of every college student's life ... as well as paying 
every increasing tuition. 

I created Sexy Scholarship as an interesting, fun way for col/ege 
students to express themselves in fun adult material; and from start 

to finish every project will be produced by col/ege students OUR age. 
This service will offer col/ege students the best opportunities with 
the absolute highest fees around to any col/ege student, male or 
female (or couples), and any sexual orientation (Straight, Gay, 
Lesbian, Bi, etc.) to model for projects with an adult theme_ From 
softcore to hardcore, still photos to video, you don't even need to 
show your face in any work if you choose. 

Any UCSD student over the age of 18 can be eligible; we guarantee 
the highest rates ... where else could you get an ENTIRE QUARTER'S 
worth of tuition (Over $25001) paid for in B single aftemoon of work? 
Whether you've done this before or are totally new, Sexy Scholarship 
is open to YOU. Consider the absolute highest rates we offer as a 
sign of appreciation to college students willing to express themselves 
sexually. 

Not only is Sexy Scholarship looking for models, but students with 
professional skills (web design, photogrephy, graphic design). 

And our PROMISE at Sexy Scholarship: Every time student fees are 
raised, whether from the UC Regents or UCSD's own greedy 

administrators, our rates will ALWAYS go up to match them. 

class has a lot to do with our 'senior 
leadership this year. The assistant 
coaches did a good job of teaching 
the game the way we like it to be 
played to our freshmen and letting 
our freshmen watch our seniors do 
it the way they've been doing it for 
years. It was a gr~at combination."

By Rae! Enteen 
PORTS FDITOR 

E ffective fall quarter of 2006, student wishing to par-ticipate in a club sport will not be able to rely on the Student Health Insurance Plan, but rather wiU have to pay extra for a supplementary plan presented to the sports club department. 
ampus administrators, deciding that it hould not be the cam-

pus' responsibility to pay for the increasing cost of covering UCSD's 
student athletes' injuries, forced club ports to find a way to fund 
their own insurance. 

According to Brian Murray, director of student health and well -
ness, the decision was a result of many factors, including "escalating 
premium increases and the need to provide a low-cost insurance 
plan" for tens of thousands of students enrolled in S.H.I.P. 

"The reason for the above action was based on claims expe-
rience, recognition of the potential claims liability to the plan 
and from input from the Student Health Insurance Advisory 
Committee requesting review of the benefits included in S.H.I.P. 
for intercollegiate athletic injuries:' Murray stated in a letter to con-
cerned club sports participants. 

Under the previous policy, students paid a fee of about $2 per 
year to cover the cost of insuring both intercollegiate and club stu-
dent-athletes. However, HlAC and Murray decided the policy was 
unfair to nonathletes. As an alternative, Murray offered a price of 
$22,500 for club sports and around $15,000 for intercollegiate ath-
letic teams to be covered under S.H.I.P. The intercollegiate athletic 
department paid the price, but for Director of UCSD Sports Clubs 
Scott Berndes, the offer was not so enticing. 

"[The] intercollegiate [athletics department] went ahead and 

Mavs' 
JE...,....,...-I~ 

paid for it, but for [the sports dub] , $22,500 is quite a bit of our 
budget; Berndes said. "The ports club program and the recreation 
department just couldn't afford that because it would really hurt 
our programs. So, at that point we decided that we were not going 
to pay for it and we started a campaign to inform people that they 
cannot have USHIP if they want to participate in a sports club:' 

The campaign to find an affordable solution for the athletes is 
important for Berndes and the continued success of his club teams 
because one-fourth to one-third of club sports participants use 
USHIP. According to Berndes, 280 to 300 of the 1,000 club sport 
athletes will need to take action to be able to play next year. News of 
the development has outraged students and parents alike and teams 
are now at risk of losing Significant numbers of participants. 

"During recruitment, after we get people interested in play-
ing, we're going to have to tell them about the insurance issue;' 
enior men's ultimate captain Quinn Kennett said. "I have a 

feeling that it would have a significant effect on attrition, with 
people realizing how much playing the sport will cost with fees 
and everything:' 

Originally, Berndes and some athletes thought that it would cost 
from $900 to $1 ,400 for participants to pay for a secondary insur-
ance. Recently, Berndes also realized that athletes under fmancial 
aid or athletic scholarship that were used to having U HIP paid 
for them suddenly had to consider whether their participation in 
a sport was worth $1 ,000 a year. Berndes also said that 90 percent 
of grad students use S.H.I.P. insurance because they have it coveFCd 
through grants and scholarships, affecting their participation in 
club sports as well. 

"I think back in January, if we had known all this - and maybe 
we should have done more research, I don't know - we would have 
jumped on it quicker," Berndes said. 

UCSD's club 
sports dept. 
can't afford 

$22,500 
necessary to 

continue S.H .I.P. 
coverage for 

athletes. 
After exploring the different options he had and communicat-

ing with Murray, Berndes agreed on a plan that would make it 
easier for S.H.I.P. carriers to play in their desired sport with mini-
mal financial burden. 

"What we've done - and this is the best we can do - is found 
an insurance broker that offers an affordable supplementary cover-
age that works with the S.H.I.P. insurance and allows athletes to 
participate; Berndes said. 

According to the letter from Murray, this supplementary insur-
ance ranges in cost, from a low ofS12.95 per year for sailing to the 
highest price ofSl09 per year for ice hockey. 

"With this new option, it's not that bad, but I still feel bad that 
[the stude$] have to pay extra," Berndes admitted. "But we did do 
a lot of research once we were aware that there were some things 
that weren't clear to us, and I think weve come up with the best 
way around this." 

Though this new development is clearly beneficial for the ath-
letes, some of them say the change in S.H.I.P. policy will still take 
its toll on club sports. 

"I'm fearful - not just for our program, but for a lot of pro-
grams - of losing the ability to recruit new members easily," 
Kennett said. "I understand that there's a large percentage of 
people that have insurance outside of US HIP, but for those people 
that don't, it's a Significant financial burden, and I don't feel the 
tudents should have to suffer because of a decision by the health 

board:' 
Though the situation is not ideal, Berndes said that the campus 

should not expect it to be permanent, since UCSD will be exploring 
insurance options outside of S.H.I.P. at the end of the next school 
year. With a whole new policy set, Berndes hopes that there will be 
room to cover the cost of insuring all athletes once again.
