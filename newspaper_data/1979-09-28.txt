North City West Vote Delayed 
By Kathy Huffer 

Associate New. Editor . 
Del Mar was able to buy two weeks' time for 

further consideration of North City West 
yesterday after convincing the San Diego City 
COI,Incil to suspend final approval of the 
development. 

In an unexpected but familiar move, the 
council "grudgingly" voted 9·0 to postpone 
theIr decision on the development until Oct. 1 7. 

Primarily responsible for the delay was the 
Coalition for. Responsible Planning, a Del Mar· 
based group which has raUied area suppOrt 
against North City West, and which yesterday 
initiated the ' request for "continuance" of the 
issue. 

Environmental Impact Report availa,ble a week 
ago, and the San Diego City Manager's fiscal 
report, released last Tuesday, Joseph said the 
new information on North City West should be 
studied further before the council makes its final 
decision. 

Council members appeared syrprised by 
Joseph's testimony and took more th)..n an hour 
and a half to decide to postpone their vote. 

City staff members present at the council 
hearings, asked to respond to the coalition's 
statements downplayed the just.released 
reports. Although they agreed that the reports 
were released late, staff members told the 
council that "only about 10 percent".olthe final 
report w as new material. 

Tony Joseph, attorney for the group who 
made the request, told the council that San 
Diego residents were not given &ufficient time to 
review two reports on North City West that 
were released just days ago. 

Referring to the flnaJ draft of San Diego's 

Dwight Wardon, attorney for Del Mar, later 
told the Daj/y Guardian this 10 percent is ·"the 
most important part" of the study. Containing 
an assessment of mitigation measures for the 
impacts for North City West, the nt:w

Hospital Doesn't Meet 
E~rthquake Standards 

By Ri .. Lee Podolsky 
Neither the Univ~sity Hospital nol' the campus buildings meet 

current earthquake ,safety regulations, hospital officials say. 
The hospital opened in 1963 and measured up to 1958 

earthquake standards, but new laws passed in 1976 are "twice as 
tough," said Associate Vice Chancellor of Facilities Management 
Don Sites. 

He says that very few buildings built in California before 1976 
conform to the new standards. Vincent Bonini of the Architects 
and Engineers department added, "97 percent ot the buildings in 
San Diego and Los Angeles" do not conform either. 

But the Regents have commissiont:d a study by the St:ismic 
Engineers Association, to be released in four to six weeks, 
examiniftg the hospital's ability to withstand earthquakes. 

A spokesperson for the hospital said that the Regents are 
currently negotiating with San Diego County to buy the hospital. 
Depending on the results of the study, the Regenb will decide 
whether or not to allocate funding for making the hospital more 
earthquake resistant. Bonini commented that the new outpatient 
wing meeb the 1976 law and is "safe." 

Gene Meyers of the state Building Code Office backed Bonini, 
saying that the 1976 regulations do not apply to buildings built 
before 1976. To fix every house, office and ho&pital built before 
1976 in the state would be a near impossiblity, he says. 

Bonini explains that the hospital's position is not unique, and 
that other hospital. are in the same position. Scripps and V A 
Hospital spokesmen say their hospitals do not meet 1976 
standards either. 

William B. F Tetter, UC vice· president, said that the Regenb are 
concerned about University Hospital, but have a "continuing 
commitment to the University's medical IIChool and the 
community as a whole." 

Almost all the UCSD campus buildings were built before 1976. 
A study of t~ safety of them all would cost the Regents about 
$150,000, Sitt:ll said.

Despite Costly Additions, 
Parking Lines 'Inefficient' 

By Caitlin Horowitz 
The newly created parking lots on the Third 

agd Warren coJlege campust:S could have 
accommodated 'more vehicles had they bt:t:n 
planned differently, the independent firm 
Manning, Strjping ~ Sealing I;lid YeJterday. 

And having spent a reported $324,000 on 
the two lots which now provide about 600 more 
spaces than last year, UCSD might be hard 
pressed to correct the areas at $750 a lot, said 
one facilities official. 

However according to principal engineer 
Robert Johnson, who designs all UCSD 
parking lots, the lots were made accordinf{ to 
specifications which have always been adhered 
to. 

"We go by the standards we have always 
gone by," said Johnson, who also maintained 
that the additions were of the best design. 

The discrepancy lies in the way the lots are 
arranged. Tht:y art: painted as rows allowing 
for travel in both directions, as opposed to the 
popular ont: way design most large shopping 
centers use. Parking spaces project at 90 
degree anglt:S. They are narrower other spaces 
on campus. In contrast, the Manning company 
suggested that spaces placed at 60 dt:gree 

angles would create room for more 
automobiles. 

In fact, the company's representative 
projected that as many as 20 spaces per 400 
might have been created with the design 
c.bIlnges. At that rate, if all of UCSD's 8000 
spaces wert: converted, there would be space to 
park nearly 400 more cars. 

"The 90 degree arrangement is the most 
efficient use of land for these areas, the engineer 
said, also citing the rectangular shape of the 
area as a limiting factor. 

The new areas will not solve the parking 
problem. Although they do provide mort: 
spaces, they cannot relieve the worst'problems 
of congestion aDd parking scarcity in popular 
locations , says Parking Mi:mager Bob 
Umstead. 

The added cost this year ($3 above last 
year's $42 student rate), Ulmstead says, was 
implemented to bolster the program for transit 
alternatives. 

"Bus service will be increased this year as a 
result of the (parking) fee increases. Securing 
new runs from the San Diego Transit 
Corporation is not cheap. The affected lines

UCSD Behind Times - Schools 
Switching to Female Majorities 

By Ci~y Beveridge 
Staff Writer 

The number of women enrolled in San 
Diego's universites has surpassed male 
enrollment for the first time, fall registration 
figures show. 

The figures reOect a nat.ionwide trend in 
which the balance between mt:n and women 
at universities is nearing a balance. 

With female enrollment at 44 percent last 
year, UCSD is one of the two exceptiona to 
the pattern. 

United States International University i 
the only other area campus at which men 
continue to outnumber women. 

USIU's average of two men to every 
woman may be attributed to the: fact that 30 
percent of their students art: from foreign 
countries, admission. officers lay, where 
colleges seldom encour~e women to get a 
collegt: education. UCSD's predominantly 

lICit!l1Ce·orient~ curriculum h811 always 
drawn a l"rRer number of mt:n than women. 

Most of the other campu es in the UC 
y tern hover dOle to a SO·SO split in 

enrollment ratios. 
San Diego State University has, a female 

population of over 50 percent and University 
of San Diego over 55. Sixty percent of the 
freshmen at USD are women, which might 
suggest that female enrollment is on the 
increast:. Historically, however, at most 
universities the proportion of females in a 
freshman class has decreased as the class 
progressed from freshman to senior. 

Point Loma College currently has a 
female population of 59 percent. 

For many UCSD students, this upward 
trend is viewed as inevitable and does not 
corne as a surprise. 

"I think it's reat," said Tom Enger, a 
junior here. "If were a woman, I wouldn't 
settle for the life of a secretary. Wornen can 
no longer afford to do that." 

Julie Berger, a sophomore with an 
undeclared major, is looking for a field that 
will guarantee her a self supporting 
profe aion. "I want to know that I will be able 
to support mYlieU and not have to depend on 
anyone else," he said. .

The most touching plea 
from an LA air quality official 
came during a radio interview 
the day the .mog was 
"hazardous"; "We wrote to 
Pre.ident Carter three months

happen,". he said, "but we

asked, di.playing. a Susan B.

There hal been lot. of 
commentary about the new 
coin, molt of which boils down 
to three points: 1) It i. the 
same .ize 81 a quarter, 2) It 
look. like a quarter, and 3) It 
feels like a quarter. 

So I compared the thing to a 
quarter. A quarter hal

might mi .. the difference. The 
dollar also hal an imperfect 
circle ihaped from 11 short 
line. and say. ONE DOLLAR 
on the back. The de'isns are 
different, too, and the dollar is 
obviously bigger. If you .pend 
money without looking at it 
fir.t, you might be confused, 

. but then you are al.o dumb 
and are confused by elevator 
buttons and cereal box 
opening instructions. The coin 
has advantage~ one of which 
is 'that it's much ea.ier to pull 
two or three coins from your 
pocket or change purse than it 
i. to pull paper from your 
\¥aIlet. (The paper money 
looks the same, too, if you 
don't look at it.) 

My gue.s is that the 
complaint. about the new 
coin., especially from 
conservative and busine.s 
circles, grow from general 
anti-government fever and the 
very specific, gut feelinr that 
an important American 
feminist hal no busine .. being 

. on our money. (Maybe the 
redneck defaced my $10 
because it ca~ .. iew III pjtture of

.exi.m lies behind the 
shameful campaign lut year

and the often vitriolic criticillll 
of CalT rans head Adrienne 
Gianturco. Ript-wing .ta~e 
senator H.L. "BiIl" Richard-
son, who led the smear 
.campaign against Bird, 
probably can't bear see 

As far as the coin is 
concerned, I accept aU U.S. 
currency' and expect 
merchants to do the same, and 
I think even the mo.t fierce 
opponents among them will 
come around if we appejll to 
their ba.ic values. Try this test 
on the next .tore that has a 
"We Accept No SBA dollars" 
in the window. Make a $50 
purchase, and give the guy

"We also have well developed carpool and vanpool services; we help people

As of yet, however, UCSD provides no incentives, for car- and van.poolers. 

Umstead believes the chief benefit enjoyed by ride sharers is the sharing of gas, 
but said that certain incentives offered by the university may be implemented in 
the future. he did not specifically identify what they were, but would not deny that 
they might mean preferential parking. . 

Student complaints of exorbitant parking rates are uncalled for, accordmg to 
Umstead. 

. "When you stop to think that people in the city of La Jolla pay upwards of a 
dollar an hour to park, you must realize that students are getting a great bargain 
here." 

Ul1stead added that things could very possibly get worse. 
"Right now, it looks as if federal employees (who hve always parked free of 

charge on federal property) are going to have to start paying parking rates 
consistent with those of the commercial area. If this were to come down to UCSD 
through the state via the Regents, it could translate into substantial permit rate 
raises later on. 

Though he added that these raises are unlikely to effect the students, he noted 
tht they might'have a profound effect on the budgets in general. But, Umstead 
added, nothing will happen for quite some time.

SACRAMENTO - A Superior Court judge 
ordered state Supreme Court justices' salaries 
cut oft yesterday, saying the court is 
unconstitutionally holding cases longer than 90 
day. without ruling. . 

Judge Joseph Babich made the ruling in 
response to a suit by the rightist Law and Order 
Campaign Committee, which said the court has 
held'24 cases longer than 90 day one for nearly ' 
four years. 

The provision of the state Constitution says 
judges may not be paid if cases are held longer 
than 90 days after they are submitted is based

AS· to Fonn Committee on Chancellor 
By Meg Honda 

The search for a new chancellor is on and tht: AS is fonning 
the Student Committee on Chancellor Search to "process 
infonnation between the Regtmts' Search Committee and the 
(UCSD) IItudents more eUiciently." 

The committee will be compolled of four studt!nts, one from 
each college, plus AS President Carlos Montalvo llefving as 
chairman. According to Montalvo, the purpose of the committee 
is to "disseminate the vast Quantities of infonnation that will be 
coming from Sacramento and send it back to the college 
councils" and to assure that undergraduate input would be made 
"more directly" to the Regt:nts' commillt!t!.ln addition, the single 
undergraduate representative to the Regents' committee will be 
selected by the student committee from one of their number. 

The name of the undergraduate to sit on the Regents' 
committee Wall to be submitted by Septt:mber 3. However, 
Montalvo felt that it was impossible to make such an 
appointment by that date because the AS council does not meet 
during the summer. 

According to Montalvo, UC President David Saxon expected 
the AS president to choose the representative. "For anyone 
student to repres~nt all four colleges is nonserving," Montalvo 
said. 

After discussing the problem with tile AS Council, it was 
decided that Montalvo would chair a special committee to 
choose a council of four representatives from the four colleges 
who would in turn select the student for the Regents' committee. 

'The individual college councils will submit names of nominees 
to Brad Barham, AS Commisioner of Appointments and 
Evaluations. The special AS committee (Barham, Montalvo, 
and the four AS representatives from the colleges) , will evaluate 
the nominees and submit names to the AS Council for final 

-

approval . Any problt:ms with the selections will 
bt: referrt:d to the individual collegt: councils. 

Montalvo said that President Saxon 
"expressed concern to lIet up open .tudt!nt 
forumll" bt:tween the Regents' committt!t! and 
all UCSD students concerning the chancellor 
selection. 

Prior to setting up these forumll, the Rt:gents' 
committee is to be informed by IItudents leaders 
of the pertinent issues concerning .tlldent 
affairs on campus. This particular reliponllibility 
would be taken up by the student committt:e. 

Montalvo stresllt:d that the committee's main 
function i. to serve all a "clearing houlIt: of 
information" for all students. 

He noted that the committee's 
responsibilitiell were originally intended for one 
perllon. "I don't ft!t!lthat anyone student can 
adequately handle this," said Montalvo. 

Asked if the committee would have any real 
influence on the final deciliion of the Regents' 
committt:e, Montalvo llaid that it should 
provide "a more viable impact on the selection 
of the chancellor." 

Lia~ility Conceded in PSA Crash 
But Punitive' Damages Escaped 
SAN DIEGO (AP) - The principal 

defendants in 13 approaching trials stemming 
from a colliliion between a jetliner and a small 
plane that killed 144 persons say they won't 
contest liability. 

The offers, expected to shorten the trials, 
were made in federal court Wednesday on 
behalf of the U.S. government, PaciSc 
Southwest Airlines and Gibbs Flying Service. 
Earlier, they made a similar offer in San Diego 
Superior Court. 

A total of 144 people died Sept. 25, 1978, in 
the collision of a PSA airliner and a two· place 
Gibbs training plane Hying over San Diego. 

PSA has setded a number 01 wrongful death 
. daims out of court. No settlement amounts 
were disclosed publicly. 

The Gibbs' offer was contingent on an 
agreement by plaintiff. not to pursue punitive 
damages. Attorneys for the plaintiffs said they 
would study the offers after receiving them in 
writing.

Running ·their moat basic 
offense and defense, the water 
polo team scratched past 
Groumont College lut night 
15·11 in the l'titon's season 
opener. 

Sure, the offense looked 
scrappy. but the picks left 
players open in front of the 
goal at limes, and the three 
returning starters rifled in 10 
goals among themselves. 

Yel, the defense turned on 
and then back off a.iain with 
no pattern evident. The man· 
to-man coverage appeared as 

thick as cafeteria oatmeal at 
some times, forcing their 
opponents to throwaway 
easily blockable shots, yet at 
other momenta couldn't 
contain the Groumont drives. 

But the team won, and 
showed sign. of organization, 
unlike the haphazardneu of 
early 1978. Groumont scored 
the firat goal, but Toby 
Raymond and Kai Loedel 
sailed in goaJs from several 
yards out to pan their 
opponenll up, and the Tritons 
never ceded the lead again . 

Loedel, lut year's team 
high.scorer, continued scoring 

in the game, ending up with 
five points for the night. Dan 
£by, another big shooter from 
last year, muscled in two goals 
from his hole position arid two 
more on a penalty shot and a 
fast break Dan Crane, th. 
other junior starter back from 
1978 made lOfTIe intelligent 
plays, but "played better 
mentally than physically" in 
the words of - coach Russ 
Hafferka~p. 

Willie Morris, who usually 
starts in the goal, couldn't suit 
up tonight because of a pair of 
pulled hamstring muscles, had 
to give his goalie dap to 

se.eks to employ 
qualified UCSD 

students 

freshman Pat Vergn. The 
newcomer came up with 
several spectacular blocks at 
arms·reach, but got burned for 
a few points in the shallow end 
of the pool because of his 
stature, 01' lack of it. 

Vergn claims to be 5'9, but 
HaHerkamp says he's more 
like "5'9 standing on a four· 
inch platform." 

Another welcome surprise 
came from freihman Ken 
South, who popped in a score 
in the second period, and 
contributed around three 
assists. 

Please tu". to fXille 13 

Coach Andy Skief sees a 
dogfight developing bel ween 
UC Davis, Santa Barbara, 
Berkeley, and possibly Irvine. 
But once again, the Tritons 
probably won't finish among 
the top schools. 

One new runner, however, 
may keep up with the fastest 
harriers from those other 
tearns. He is Hector Garcia, a 
freshman who has been 
running with an AAU club in 
Calexico. "Thall just an early 
prediction," cautions Skief. 
But after only three days 
practicing wilh the team, 
Garcia looks to be the Triton's 
beat hope at the moment.

'New Book' a FIoll 

'Ignore:' a Thing 
To Do With Lists 

By Lynette Tom 
Senior Staff Writer 

Authors MIU'~et Oberman and Dougl81 Stockier meant 
well when they 'ded to write a .. tire on the besbeller, The 
Book of Li.,.. Unfortunately, their resulting collaboration, I 
Could Ht,ue Been A Contender or The Other Book of Lists, does 
not quite live up to their aspiration •. 

The book 'compri.ea 22 chapter; of ethnic expletives, sexist 
aIUrs, putrid puna, and general cheap mob. For example: "150 
cockroaches in single file, .waying 10 the Latin rhythm of a 

, co"iO drum" as the first of 5 Thin,s Health In.pectors Like To 
Find In Me.rican Restaurant.; the adage ''1he way 10 a man's 
heart is through hi.lhorta" 81 one of 7 Surefire Ways To Hook 
A Man With; and "Hang around the brooder" as the tap 
IUgeation in 5 Wall' To Pick Up Chick •. 

The Daily Guardian lI'riday, Sept. 28, 1879 

Occaaionally, the reader will come across a subtlety that is 
IOfI1ewhal amusing, 81 is the case with "You get an invite 10 the 
~e of Birth of a Nation" for 6 WailS To Tell That The 
POital SerVice I. Getting Wor.ej "Cram it in your cheek. and 
scare the ,randchiJG.en like Brando in The Godfather" for 6' 
1Ja1n,. 'To Do With Day.Old Bread, and "Defecting" for 8 
WaUl Ballet Dancer. Spend Their Spare TIme. However, these 
spurts of clevernea. offer little compensation for the book's 
mainstay 01 bed material, which i. not much different from the 
thiq. heard on an elementary school playground.during recess. 

Margaret Oberman and Dougl81 SteCkler have produced a 
poor ipOOf. In fact, the only two individuals who would be 
remotely interested in ever reading the book are those who have:

to places lbat .-e ltrikintIy 
photogenic. Once there, we 
place our camera between our 
eye and the subject we 
travelled to tee. The oblellion 
to photograph the scenery, to 
take horne a lIIIaD bit of the 
place, separates us from the 
actual object, from · the 
experience ibdf. We have 
become, in Sontag's view, 
"Iourists in reality." 

Sontag appears to have a 
Iove·hate relationship with the 
photography. Throughout the 
book, she lauds the wonders of 
certain photographers. She 
proclaims her deep love for 
photography dating. from the 
time when, ai a child, she was 
enthralled by a book of photos. 
Yet her idea of what 
photography is teems to be out 
of focus and slightly 
uodeveJoped. ,Sontag at times 
sounds as thou,h she'd like to 
return to a more Romantic era, 
where a Whitman·like "family 
of man" ideal would permeate 
the entire aesthetic of 
photography. Her aims sound 
pathetically nationalistic at 
times, inasmuch as most 01 the 

artists Ihe talka about are 
American, in .eeming 
iporance of the 'act thai 
much of the advancements 01 
photographic technique and 
style were done by f.uropeana. 
Some 01 the aharpest criticism 
in the book, though, it leveled 
at the American public, whom 
she regards as gross 
overconsumers. She attributes 
this propensity for exaggerat· 
materialism to the idea that 

photography haa created a 
masa perception of realitr 
that's analogous to Plato s 
Allegory 01 the Cave: that ia, 
aD we lee are the mere 
lhadows of tints, and not the 
thing if1 and of itself. Becalile 
we are bombarded by images 
~veryday, we crave an 
"alternative cosmos" where 
everything i. perfect, well 
ordered, and in its assigned 
place, like an advertisement 
which places speciSc · brand 
names in a prominent place in 
a photographed representa. 
tion ' of what we recognized as 
an everyday situation. Out 
day.to-day existence, she 
poslulates, is rendered 
meaningless through this 
usurping 01 the perceptual 

process. 
She juatifiea her arguments 

IOIRewhat wealdy by iruiating 
that modern American 
photography has become, in 
essence, "1W'I'ea1i1lic" • (citing 
the' Loa Anseles junes as an 
example). But she balks at 
insisting that the surreal nature 
01 American mauconscious 
has been ~rupired and almost 
singIe.handedly created by 
this trend.

Protecting Hawaii 'from Bombs Su~n Sontag 
'On Photogr.aphy' Continued (rom page 2

Judge Dick Yin Wong in 
Honolulu ruled against 
Catholic Action, finding that 
the DOD had acted as much 
as possible in keeping with 
the National Environmental 
Protection Agency guide. 
lines. 

Catholic Action appealed, 
with the help of the Center for 
Constitutional Rights in New 
York. 'We think there's a 
constitutional right at issue 
here,' explains Center 
attorney Nancy Stearns, 
'and we have aaked the court 
to amend the complaint to 
include the violation of the 
people of Hawaii's right not 
to be deprived of life or 
property without due process 
of law.' 

The case has been further 
complicated by the p1aintiHs' 
request for an injunction to 
prevent the Navy from 
moving nuclear weapons into 
West Loch Wltil after their 
appeal is decided. 

This request for an 
injunction has already added 
an interesting twist to the 
case. In a letter dated Aug.

30, 1979, Martin Green, an 
attorney for the government, 
requested that the injW1Ction 
be denied. He added that, 
should the court seriously 
consider granting Ihe 
injunction, the goverrunent 
would present classified 
material to the court which 
would show cause why it 
should be denied. 

What has the attorneys for 
Catholic Action up in anns is 
that this material, if it is 
submitted, would only be 
seen by the court-·not by the 
public, or even by Catholic 
Action's attorneys. 

The Ninth Circuit Court 
has not yet acted on the 
injunction request, nor has it 
asked for additional material 
from the goverrunent. A 
hearing on the appeal is stiD 
to he scheduled. 

The case could have far· 
ranging repercussions. 'The 
Department of Defense 
admits that there have been 
27 accidents in the past 20 
years··many of these 
involving the release of 
nuclear ma terial,' said 
Albertini.

tional Rights, in its opening 
brief for the appeal, stresses 
that it is not only the 
possibility of a nuclear 
explC)sion that is in question. 
It argues that should there 
be a fire in one of the storage 
bWlkers .. possibly caused by 
an airplane crashing on 
approach to nearby 
Honolulu International 
Airport.-plutonium could be 
spread over an area of at 
least 100 square miles. 

The Navy atgues that the 
dangers of any such accident 
are minimal, and that people 
face more risk from tidal

volcanoes than from nuclear 
weapons.

Strand and others, are often 
degant and polished, but 
Sontag oIten reverIeS herself, 
without explanation, and 
attacks an unnamed 
photographer by insisting that 
their work typified, rather 
mysteriously, " ... the implicit 
act of aggression in a very use 
of the camera, "or for violating 
subjects because the shot 
captures an aspect of the 
subject that the subject itself 
never teeS. In other words, 
most photography constitutes 
an invasion of privacy even 
when the subject knows he or 

she is being snapped. On the 
one hand, Sontag can be 
fascinating, astute and 
historically accurate and 
inspired when writing about 
the work of a particular 
photographer. And yet she 

. often changes tack in mid· 
paragraph and ends up 
criticizing the same work by 
the same artist in terms that 
indicate that such work has no 
right to exist. In all, she sounds 
as though she has two heads 
about the subject, and that On

There are a whole mess of bones in your feet. 
Fifty-two to be exact. 

. To take proper care of all of them, you need a good 
pair of shoes. . 

Like the one you see below. A Rockport. 
That bottom is not one big hunk of crepe. It's eight 

separate layers. This makes the bottom softer. More 
flexible. Easier on your feet. 

And that shoe won't rub your foot the wrong way, 
either. Because inside is a full leather lining that's been 
specially tanned to make it soft and comfy. 

Slip your feet or female) into a pair 
of Rockports. 

Theyll follow you

North City . West Decision 
Put Off By City Council 

. Continued from POte 1 
information is easential for the lawsuit being 
threatened by Del Mar agaiMt the City of San 
Diego, Wardon said 

Wardon also said the fiscal report contained 
results contradicting Del Mar's fiscal evaluation 
of North Cit}' West. 

1be San Diego report concludes that North 
City West will financially benefit Del Mar, while 
Wardon's consultants reported that Del Mar 
will suffer deficit· possibly even bankruptcy - as 
a result of the proposed development. 

"Del Mar is holding the bag," he remarked. 
"It doesn't cost (the City of San Diego) a penny 
to kill Del Mar." 

Representative from the Baldwin and Pardee 
construction . companies, the two primary 
developers of North City West, told the council 
that such delays are unllefessary, and were 
responsible for the 10 years spent on planning 
the development. 

Councilwoman Maween O'Connor shot 
back that a decision on North City West would

the rule. lost! 

have been made much earlier if tht: developers 
had come up with a satisfactory schooling plan 
for North City West, an issue which Mayor 
Pete Wilson said yesterday must be resolved 
before he will approve the development. 

The request for a postponement was further 
supported by Wardon, speaking on behalf of 
the City of Del Mar. He seconded the 
Coalition's move for a delay of the approval 
vote. 

Little public support was evident in the chaly 
air of the council chambers, despite extensive 
advance publicity on the hearing. The crowd 
count was surprising after the earlier public 
hearings were packed. The coalition's decision 
to ask for a postponement Wels responsible, 
according to Gemma Parks, coalition co-chair. 

The postponed hearitags and final vote are 
schedule for Wednesday, Oct. 17, at8:30 am.

City Administration building, 202 C Street.
