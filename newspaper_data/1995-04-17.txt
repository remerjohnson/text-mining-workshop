Harvard Denies Girl 
Who Killed Mother 
BOSTON - Harv~rd 
University rescinded its early 
acceptance offer to a high 
school girl who killed her 
mother five years ago. Gina 
Grant failed to disclose any 
juvenile criminal record on her 
Harvard application, despite 
pleading no conte t to 
voluntary manslaughter in 
1990. According to Grant 's 
lawyer, she had acted in self-
defense against her mother 
who had frequently been 
abusive. A Harvard spokes-
man said the university 
occasionally withdraws 
acceptances if applicants have 
misrepresented themselves.

Falk Captures A.S. Presidency 
ELEcnON: Voters come out in 
force, reject football and club 
sport referenda 
By Ben Ellin 
Associate News Editor 

In the highest voter turnout since 1988, UCSD 
students elected Naomi Falk as A.S. president 
and rejected referenda to fund club sports and a 
football team in last week's elections. 

The hotly contested races fot V.P. administra-
tive and V.P. finance will be decided in a run-off 

falk, running under the Legalize It slate, gar-
nered 51.6 percent of the vote to edge out John 
Barnes. 

"I'm pretty satisfied," said Falk. "We haven't 
had as progressive a president in the last four 
years and it's about time." 

"I want to hit the ground running," she added. 
"I would like to start [forming] a cabinet imme-
diately." 

While Barnes believes everyone should rally 
around the elected government, he said Falk 
should keep in mind her opposition's proposals 
due to the narrow margin of victory.

will contend for the V.P. finance spot. 

Both the club sport ref-
erendum and the football referendum suffered 
defeat at the polls, pulling in 60.7 percent and 
38.7 percent of the vote, respectively. Over 3,200 students cast their ballots during 

the three-day election, totaling about 23 percent 
of the student body. Nearly one-third of the 
student body voted in the 1988 elections, when a 
similar football referendum appeared on the bal-
lot. 

Despite its decisive majority, the club sport 
referendum required a two-thirds majority to 
pass.

Nottley.

infected with HIV/AIDS.

Oub sport Director Scott 8erndes 
said the club sport referendum's rela-

sports <!ff~red through the program. 

" It's going to involve everybody; 
it doesn't go to 60 guys on a football 
team," he said. " It's appeal is broad-

" I thought that 61 percent was 
pretty indicative of how much sup-

8erndes added. 

Referendum Question One, 
which would have funded a I]CSD 
footbalL team, was defeated with 
only 38.7 percent of the voters sup-
porting it. The referendum, which 
called for a $29.50 a quarter manda-
tory fee increase, also included funds 
for A.S. activities and other inter-
collegiate athletics. 

In other campus-wide votes, 
Damien Wilpitz won a three-field 
heat for the commissioner of aca-
demic affairs position with 62.5 per-
cent of the tally and Farsam Shadab 
defeated Patty Rangel for the com-

BR.IDGING THE GAP WITH 
BUBBLECUM 

By DEREK VAN HOFTEN, tt41lll¥w 
In the June 3, 1991 issue of Tune maga-

zine, Susan Brownmiller claimed that "Rape 
is nothing more than a conscious process of 
intimidation by which all men keep all women 
in a state offear." This statement exemplifies 
the status of the modem feminist movement. 
A movement which once successfully em-
powered women has degenerated into a para-
noid mob, focusing instead on victimization, 
gross stereotyping, separatism and male-bash-
ing. However, the worst result of this meta-
morphosis is that it has diverted the public 's 
attention away from the real problems which 
plague our society. Rather than focus on hard 
work and independence as the keys to suc-
cess, many instead resort to incessant com-
plaining, as exemplified by Brownmiller. 

Empowerment was originally the focus of 
the feminist move-

worries? 
Unfortunately, the feminist has 

also manipulated the issue of rape to 
perpetuate her role as a victim. Cur-
rent standards dictate that a man has 
committed rape if he has had in-
tercourse with a woman when 
she might not have wanted 10, 
regardless of whether or not 
she made her feelings 
clear. She didn 't need 
to say or indicate 
"no" for it to have 
been considered 
rape. It may 
even have 
been rape if 
the woman 
said "yes." Su-
san Estrich c1ai ms 

that ..... so long as women are pow-
erless relative to men, viewing 

'yes ' as a sign of true con-
sent is misguided." Ac-

cording to Tune maga-
zine, another femi-
nist went even further 

by saying that it was perfectly 
acceptable for a woman to falsely 
accuse a man of rape: "If a woman 
did falsely accuse a man of rape, she

nately, many of 
loday's femin is ts 
spend most of their 
time lamenting their status 
as victims, powerless to ac-
complish anything under 
such oppressive male 
dominance. Katie Rophie, 
who has frequently spoken 
out against the radical ten-
dencies of feminism, noted 
that this victimization 
serves only to "deny 
[women 's] own agency 
and in tell igence, as strong 
and sensual, as autono-
mous .... " Rather than edu-
cating the public about 
women 's strengths, the

may have had reasons to. Maybe she 
wasn't raped, but he clearly violated 
her in some way." With these new 
definitions of rape, women have 
never had less power, less indepen-
dence. The most lamentable result, 
however, has been the diversion of 
attention away from the real victims 
of real problems to those who ma-
nipulate illegitimate problems which 
portray women as victims.

alerting the public about 

While the struggles of women vary tre-
mendously on the international scnle, Ameri-
can women have strived to advance their sta-
tus through the Women's Movement, which 
focuses on establishing equal rights and op-
portunities for women. Though we have made 

women's lack of power. 
This victimization is most evident in the 

feminists' manipulation of sexual harassment, 
where the slightest body movement in the 
wrong direction prompts a lawsuit. In her defi-
nition of sexual harassment, Diana Russell 
included "unwanted hugs and kisses." Has 
anyone {W( received an unwanted hug at some 
time in his or her life? Feminist Marianne 
Walters dreams of a "world where one might 
never need 10 fear sexual harassment." But 
most of what modem feminists term "sexual 
harassment" is not harassment, but rather mis-
communication or discomfort that is perma-
nent in society and in any place where com-
mon interaction takes place. The bigger pic> 
ture shows many of these women longing for 
a world where they suffer no problems and

eas, we have a long 
way to go in others. 

In the first wave 
of the Women 's 
Movement, women 
fought for suffrage, 
obtaining the right 
to vote in 1920. 
With this right, they 
were somewhat 
more mobilized in 
the public arena, but 
many viewed a 
woman's main con-
tribution 10 society 
as her ability to bell 
children. Women 

were encouraged to remain in the private 
boundaries of their homes, raising families. 
It was difficult for women to see themselves 
as more than just child bearers until the 
19605, when the second wave of the Women's 
Movement occurred. From this time on, 
'women have fought to become full partici-
pants in the public sphere, striving to achieve 
equal opportunity and rights with men in the 
workplace. Some women were successful in 
obtaining full-time careers, but their pay nev-
ertheless remained lower than that ·of· men 
working in similar positions. Furthermore, in 
their initial career efforts, they were often 
scorned for mimicking male roles. Women 
persevered, however, and today there are 
more career opportunities than at any other 
time in U.S. history. 

The progress which the Women's Move-
ment has made rests heavily on a woman's 
culture and class. Women's-studies student

(Mujeres Unidas para Justicia,

Women United for Justice, Educa-

African-American women cre-
ated the Womanist Movement in 
response to the feminist movement 
which did not meet the needs of 
minority women. One of the main 
tasks within the Womanist Move-
ment has been to raise women '5 
awareness on health issues. Basic 
health rights, access to health care 
and education for their children 
and self-help are vital to the em-
powerment of women within this 
community. 

MUJER was established to rec-
ognize the needs of Chicana and 
Latina women who have long been 
expected to fight alongside men for 
the rights of their race, but who have 
rarely had the opportunity to address 
gender issues. According to Paula 
Espinaz.a, member of MUJER, 
women within her culture need 
other females as role models. 
"While Cesar Chavez was one of the

complacency with respect to the use 
of force and violence against 
women, and the list goes on. I guess 
we might want to ask if women now 
have "equal rights. " Why then do 
women under liberalism appear to 
have so much less power than men? 
And my answer would be something 
like: The operative dynamics of 
class, race and gender power are in-
visible to the formal equality before 
the law offered by liberalism. In 
other words, legal reform is only 
going to address formal inequalities

movement 
ContInued from PICe 4 
man whose wife stays at hOme ac-
quires the same \abel. Never mind thai 
some women actually stay at home on 
their own accord. This attack on males 
results in a separated society, females 
against mares: The feminists' "us 
against them" mentality directly con· 
tradicts not only tbe fundamental 
American notion of the individual, but 
also of an empowered woman capable 
of suc:ceeding on her own. 

The feminist movement's dislor-
tion of statistics proves the fraudulence 
of its dairns. According 10 a 1991 Pub-
lic Interest article, one study asserted 
tbat "balf of all women in the United 
States have been raped or molested 
before their 21st birthday." But a sur-
vey by the National VICtim Center 
claimed that 683,000 women were 
raped in 1990. However, closer exami-
nation reveals that oaly 4,008 women 
were surveyed in this study and oaly 
0.7 percent answered that they had 
been raped. The researchers applied 
this percenLagc 10 the entire U.S. popu-
lation 10 come up with 683,000. But 
since the study only came across 28 
actual reports of rape, how reliable can 
it be, especially considering the 1.5 
percent margin of error? 

The biggest culprit of this manipu-
lation has been the Ms. Foundation for 
Women, which sponsors such gender-
biased events as "Take Your Daugh-
ters to Work Day" and which revels 
in portraying women as suffering from 
low self-esteem. In defense of its 
claims and its separatistic day, the 
foundation published various statis-

tics: "Girls Ire seven times men likely 
to drop out of school for 'family re-
lated problems' ... AdoIesc:ent girls are 
four to five times more likely than 
boys to attempt suicide .... " 

But the truth tells another story. 
According to the WaU SlrtttJOIU1IaI, 
"family related problems" often in-
volve pregnancy. Beyond that, the 
total dropout rate of boys is much 
higher than of girls. A 1990 Ameri-
can Medical Association Study found 
that boys are four times more likely 
10 commit suicide. Boys as a group 
have it worse: They get lower grades, 
drop out of school more often, are 
less likely to go to college, get ar-
rested more frequentl y and suffer 
worse from drug-related problems. 
So much for the self-esteem myth. 

Feminists recently clamored over 
a study reporting that men occupy a 
signiflC3llt majority of executive p0-
sitions above the "glass ceiling." But 
they ignore the fact that since women 
oaly recendy won equal access 10 edu-
cation and the wort-place, it would 
be impolBibIe for them 10 have worked 
their way 10 the top so quickly. Just as 
with affirmative action, they feel the 
best way 10 make up for past inequi-
ties is 10 fix the end result, rather than 
the root cause. Now that women have 
gained the rights they deserve, they 
are free 10 pursue lop-level positions 
and will soon occupy their share. 

This is not to say that inequity 
doesn't exist. But the modem femi-
nist movement is not approaching 
these problems effect i vel y. It has 
abandoned its notion of empowering 
women and has instead focused on 
portraying them as victims, blaming 
men for all their problems and dis-
torting definitions, facts and statis· 
tics to bolster their bogus claims.

Satirist Muses on Past Experiences 
CALVIN TRIWN: 
Noted author speaks to 
UCSD audience 
By Francisco DeVriel 
Senior Staff Writer 
and Terry Lew 
Staff Writer:. 

In a discussion which ranged 
from the infamous midwestern chig-
gers to the Clinto{l administration, 
noted author and syndicated colum-
nist Calvin Trillin brought his wry 
sense of humor to campus last Thurs· 
day. 

Trillin, speaking to approxi-
mately 100 people, drew heavily 
from his writings and his personal 
experiences during the one· hour lec· 
ture, 

With two daughters just out of 
college,hesaid, "I'm actually happy 
to be in any educational institution 
to which I have no tuition obliga· 
tions. " 

Trillin added that he had begun 
calling the 900 number for clues to 
the New YorA: Times crossword 
puzzle. "You getthree facts for what 
I figured to be about $1.65, I don't 
do crossword puzzles myself, but I 
felt that for someone who had been 
paying tuition as long as I have, 
three facts for $1.65 was the sort of 
bargain I just couldn't pass up." 

The author of 17 books and a 
frequent contributor to The New 
Yorker and The Nation, Trillin's 
published work usually focuses on 
everyday life and everyday people. 
His discussion of politics also tends 
to lean towards the personal and

aren't you ........ ed

way? And my only 
rea. defense •• that

informal. 

- c.IvIn Trilln 
Renowned Humorist. 

Syndicated Columnist 

Trillin said he was first intro-
duced to politics at a young age 
when he became the victim of his 
sister's "expansionist backseat 
policy. " 

Riding through the American 
heartland with his family on long 
road trips, the Kansas City native 
was instructed by his father that "we 
don't hit girls," With his sister reo 
ceiving no such admonition, Trillin 

r l.I'I work envronment 

"became sort of a unilaterally dis· 
armed Finland, And she was a So· 
viet Union, bristling with weap· 
onry." 

Trillin's more recent forays into 
politics have been restricted to his 
weekly syndicated column, an ef-
fort he describes as "making snide, 
underhanded, unfair remarks about 
decent public servants." 

"People say to me, aren't you 
ashamed to make a living that way?" 
he said, "And my only real defense 
is that it's not much of a living." 

Trillin has been The Nation's 
resident poet since 1990, examining 
politics and the men and women 
who shape it. 

Frequently only a few lines long, 
his humorous poetry often lambasts 
the high and mighty, His first poem 
for The Nation, entitled, "If You 
Knew What Sununu," castigated 
President George Bush's controver· 
sial Chief of Staff John Sununu. 

As Bush left office, Trillin 
penned one of his classics. Bidding 
farewell to "George Herbert 
Walker," Trillin ended his poem 
with a bit of advice. "So now relax 
and take your ease, and never order 
Japanese, " 

Trillin's column in The New 
Yorker appears regularly under the 
tille "U.S. Journal." His latest book, 
entitled DeadJiM Poet, chronicles 
his experiences writing poetry for a 
weekly magazine. 

After takillg questions from the 
audience, Trillin remained to sign 
copies of his books. Proceeds from 
the lecture supported the Friends of 
the UCSD Library.

LECTURE: Earth Day 
founder discusses 
environmental issues 
By Dole Alexander 
Senior Staff Writer 

As the Republican·led Con· 
gress prepares to revise several 
key environmental laws, former 
WisoonsonGov.andSen.Gaylord 
Nelson expressed a mixture of 
optimism and concern about the 
future of environmentalism duro 
ing his lec:ture at the Institute of 
the Americas Thursday, 

The founder of Earth Day, 
Nelson spoke to about 40 UCSD 
and community members as part 
of a tour honoring the 25th anni· 
versary of Earth Day, April 22. 

The 78.year-old environmen· 

tal pioneer told the audience that 
the greatest challenge of 21st cen-
tury will be to forge a sustainable 
society, one which meets its own 
needs without depleting the reo 
sources of future generations. 

"The wealth of any nation is the 
air, the water, the soil, the forest, 
the minerals, the rivers, lakes and 
oceans." take that away and you 
have nothing but a wasteland," 
Nelson said. "That's the whole 
economy". These biological sys-
tems contain the sustaining wealth 
of the world." 

Criticizing claims that environ-
mental protection costs jobs, 
Nelson said such perceptions reo 
flec:t "a failure to understand the 
iron-clad connection between the 
environment and the economy."

KId Po ..... 

In a unique new project headed by 
UCSD's California Space Institute 
(CaISpace), this high-tech vision of edu-
cation in the 21st century is about to 
become a reality. Cameras mounted on 
the space shuttle, but "owned and oper-
ated" by school children, are scheduled 

for their first flight early next year, ac-
cording to CaISpace Director and UCSD 
Physics Professor Sally Ride. 

The goal, said Ride, is to integrate 
KidSat inlothe K-12 curriculum of Ameri-
. can schools, in an effort to bring science 
and technology to life in the classroom. 

"We think students are more receptive 
to learning ... if they 've got some sort of 
hands.-on project that has some real-world 
applications ... and it's got some of the 
neat aspects of space exploration," said 
Ride, who is also a former astronaut. 

KidSat, which is a joint project of 
UCSD, the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration (NASA), the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Johns 
Hopkins University is scheduled to fly 
aboard the shuttle twice a year. If all goes 
well, NASA plans to place permanent 
cameras on the Russian Space Station Mir 
by the end of the decade. 

Currently in the pilot phase, the $1 
million per year effort will place a high-
quality video camera and a high-resolution 
electronic still camera on the shuttle solely 
for use by students and their teachers. 

The middle-school students will plan 
their own missions, including choosing 
the sites to be photographed, mathemati-
cally figuring when the shuttle will pass 
overthe location and communicating with 
astronauts about the kind of detail or 
type of phenomena on which to focus. 

As weather or flight changes 
impact the shuttle's f1ight,students 
and astronauts will also be able 
to communicate updates on

Student requests for images and 
video will be sent 10 a mission con-
trol center, currently under construc-
tion at the Chemistry Research 
Building on campus. The center, 
which will be run by UCSD under-
graduat~ and local high school stu-
dents, will relay commands from 
the classrooms to NASA's mission 
control at the Johnson Space Center 
in Houston, TX. The Johnson Space 
Center will then bounce the requests 
to the shuttle. 

Images from the shuttle's video 
camera will be broadcast live to the 
interested students. Electronic still 
photographs will arrive a few min-
utes later via the Internet. 

The UCSD mission control will 
mediate all transmissions between 
the shuttle and the students, as well 
as process the images returning from 
space .

KidSat offers schools a lot more 
than just fancy photos from space, 
however. It is designed to influence 
the entire curriculum of schools af-
filiated with the project. 

"We're kind of insisting that 
schools adopt enough of the curricu-
lum that they can really get some-
thing out of this, instead of just kind 
of being a gee-whiz-neat thing to do 
for a couple of weeks and then 
school's out and it's over, "Ride said. 

Perhaps the most important facet 
of the project is that it will allow 
children to act as their own teachers. 
KidSat is designed to involve slu-
dents directly in their own education. 

"It [will] really empower the kids 

The UCSD Guardian 

Ride, the author of 
the children's book 

T~ Third Planet, also 
hopes KidSat will help 
bring the fragile state 
of our environment 
inlo clear focus. 

"II's actually pretty 
easy to see a variety of 
different kinds of en-
vironmental damage 
from the space-shuttle 
photos. And we expect 
that a lot of the class-
room projects will be 
related to environmen-
tal damage or degra-
dation," she said. 

C.lSpece Director s.l1y Ride presents

But KidSat is not 
designed solely to ben-
efit science classes.

because they will be using some-
thing no one has ever used before," 
said Muir junior and KidSat Visual-
ization Teall) member Adam 
Burgasser. "Jt'sexcitingbecause it's 
a new tool kids can use." 

According to Academic Admin-
istrator of CalSpace Mike 
Wiskerchen, KidSat will give teach-
ers and students the opportunity to 
move beyond passive lectures. 

While current curricula only al-
low students to participate in the 
analysis and problem-solving as-
pects of the scientific method, 
KidSat will enable children to iden-
tify their own hypotheses and fol-
low through with their own research. 

Morris High School teacher John 
Shaklett, who is involved with the 
project, agreed, saying that KidSat 
will give school children a "total 
approach" and "offer opportunities 
for kids to get involved in the scien-
tific method and solve problems." 

hopes it will "motivate a fairly large 
number of middle school students, 
not necessarily to become rocket 
scientists, but just to motivate them 
in their studies [in general]." 
AM.ntorCMln 

UCSD undergraduates, em-
ployed by CaISpace, make up the 
majority of KidSat staff. The group, 
along with several graduate students 
involved in the engineering aspect 
of the mission, is charged with set-
ting up the hardware necessary for 
operation as well as designing the 
KidSat software. Once up and run-
ning, undergraduate students will 
help control the flow of information 
between the shuttle and the schools. 

The undergraduates will also 
train local high school students, from 
Morris and Scripps Ranch High 
Schools at first, to operate and main-
tain the UCSD mission control cen-
ter. The high school students will do 
the bulk of the work once KidSat is 

off the ground. 
Those high school students will, 

in turn, menlor the middle-school 
students in the use of the support 
software. 

KidSat will "provide relevancy 
10 [students'] career plans and will 
give them the opportunity to work 
with college students and profession-
als in a mentoring situation," said 
Scripps Ranch High School Science 
Department Head Byron Asakawa. 
A Short ReNId 

First developed by JPL scientist 
Dr. Jobea Way a litlle over a year 
ago, KidSat has moved quickly to-
ward a reality. Ride, who shared 
Way's enthusiasm for the idea and 
agreed to join the project, then met 
with Way and NASA Director 
Daniel Goldin last September. 

"We just tried 10 tell him about 
the idea and convince him that the 
concept was a good one," Ride said. 
"It didn't take any convincing, he 
was very enthusiastic about it from 
the very beginning." 

Goldin gave KidSat a S1 million 
per year grant to launch the project. 
To ....... 21st Century 

While the flashiness of high tech-
nology can seem preeminent, Ride 
hopes that KidSat will bring a lot 
more than just neat gizmos to the 
classroom. 

The social sciences, international 
relations and environmental issues 
can easily benefit just as much as the 
natural sciences from KidSat. 

"You can think of a gazillion 
things," Ride says, with only a small 
exaggeration. 

But perhaps more importantly, it 
brings students into the curriculum. 
Whatever the topic, Ride hopes 
KidSat can bring excitement and 
interaction back into the classroom.

Space Exploration II. 
Mothl. New for Ride 

UCSO Physics Professor and 
Director of the California Space 
Institute (CaISpace) Sally Ride 
has made a career out of outer 
space. She joined the National 
Aeronautics and Space Adminis-
tration (NASA) in 1979, only one 
year after receiving her doctorate 
in physics from Stanford. And in 
1983, she became the first Ameri-
can woman astronaut when she 
spent six days in orbit aboard the 
Space Shuttle Challenger as a 
mission specialist. 

Ride flew her second and final 
shuttle flight in October 1984 
and was in training for a third 
flight when all shuttle operations 
were suspended after the Chal-
lenger accident in January 1986. 
After the disaster, she served on 
the presidential commission that 
investigated the accident. She 
then served for two years as a 
fellow at the Stanford University 
Center for Intemational Security 
and Arms Control. 

Since 1989, Ride has served 
as director of C8ISpace at the 
Scripps Institution of Oceanogra-
phy. She has twice received the 
Jefferson Award for Public Ser· 
vice for her dedication to science 
education.

scissors and in seven days, they're 
going to start cutting [federal stu-
dent aid)," he said. 

San Diego City Board of Educa-
tion member and SDSU Professor 
Shirley Weber called upon students 
to look beyond how budget cuts 
would affect university students. 

"It's not just about yourfinaru::ial 
aid," she said, "It's about the fact 
that people want to deny children 
lunches who are hungry in this na-
tion." 

While welfare refoon is a popu-
lar issue, such efforts should "give 
people jobs and opportunities and 
not simply devastate them and their 
families," said Weber. 

"This is really a contract on 
America ... when you have a con-
tract on something, you kill it. You 
kill its life, you kill its growth," she 
said. ' 

Echoing Nielsen's remarks, We-
ber implored students to become 
more involved in the political pro-
cess, 

"It's sad to me that the most 
disenfranchised .. . a million of you 
in the University of California, the 
Cal State system and the commu-
nity colleges .. . are allowing people 
to trample upon you, increasing your 

NELSON: 
Continued from pace 9 

According to Nelson, the most 
daunting environmental problem is 
population growth. When he was 
born in 1916, Nelson said, thecarth's 
population was 1.7 billion. By the 
year 2000, however, the world 's 
population is projccted to grow to 
6.3 billion. The U.s. population, 
currently 260 million, is projected 
to double by the year 2055. 

"With twice the current popula-
tion, will there be left any wilder-
ness area in this nation, will there be 
any remote and quiet places, will 
there be left any habitat for song 
birds, water foul and other wild crea-
tures?" he said. "Well, certainly not 
very much," 

To meet these challenges, Nelson 
said, society must develop a new 
environmental ethic. 

"Society's answer must be to 
focus increasing attention and en-
ergies on nurturing the conserva-
tion generation_ .. with a conserva-

fees and decreasing your opportuni-
ties," Weber said. "Why? Because 
you haven't opened your eyes to 
realize that you have the power." 

The district director for Rep. Bob 
Filner, Vincent Hall, also spoke at 
Friday's rally, criticizing GOP tax-
cut proposals as disproportionately 
benefiting the upper-class. 

"All across this country, work-
ing-class families, students, those 
people that live in the shadows of 
our society are paying the price so 
that this Congresu:an create 'mas-
sive tax breaks for the wealthiest 
Americans," Hall said, claiming that 
20 percent of the cuts would go to 
the top one-percent income bracket. 

Chastising the student-aid pro-
posals, Hall said that "Student aid is 
beingcut ina timethiscountry needs 
educated people moving into a com-
petitive world marketplace." 

According to Hall, the Stafford 
Loan cuts would affcct 340,000 stu-
dents in California and, nationally, 
students would lose $1.1 billion in 
federal aid. 

Hall called upon students to fight 
against the aid proposals and other 
cuts by pressuring their representa-
tives. 

"If everyone at this rally called at 
least five members of Congress in 
the next couple of days, you can have 
an impact in Washington," he said. 

tion ethic," he said. "Without that 
ethic, society will not have the un-
derstanding, motivation, conviction 
or political will to persist in ad-
dressing the truly hard question that 
will confront us in the decades to 
come." 

However, there are numerous 
encouraging signs that such an ethic 
is developing, according to Nelson. 

"It dawned on me two or three 
years ago that the grade-school kids, 
one to eight [years old), ask more 
penetrating questions about the en-
vironment today than the college 
kids did in the 19705," he said, 

However, "It's a challenge that 
begs, literally begs, for the kind of 
dedicated, inspirational leadership 
that was provided by Franklin 
Roosevelt and Winston Churchill in 
their pursuit of victory in the second 
world war," Nelson said_ 

"I am optimistic that your gen-
eration, the one in college today, 
will have the foresight to begin the 
task of forging a society and will 
succeed in that enterprise," he said.

Bruins Bash Tritons 
TOP-DOQS: Number-
one UCLA trounced 
UCSD on Saturday 

St.rr Writer On PaPer, it looked like the big-
gest mismatch in sports history. The 
number one-ranked UCLA Bruins 

-unbeaten in league 
play - came to 
RIMAC for a match 
against the UCSD 
men's volleyball 
team, which has gar-
nered only one vic-
tory th is season. 

The crowd gath-
ered in large numbers in anticipa· 
tion of possibly witnessing one of 
the greatest upsets in recent years, 
creating a big-game atmosphere that 
brought out the best from players on 
both sides. 

Despite one of their toughest 
team efforts of the season and a stel-
lar performance from big man 
Tyson Kerr, the Tritons (1-20) found 
themselves on the short end of the 
stick once again, falling to the top-
ranked Bruins (24-1) in four games, 
15-2,15-12,12-15,15-4 . 

At a time of the season when 
most teams without a shot at the 
playoffs just pack it in, the UCSD 
volleyballers worked hard through 
the end of the season, hoping to 
build for the future.

Mustangs Master Tritons 
DOUBLE DIP: UCSD drops two games at The Master's College 
., .... RehImI 
Staff Writer 

A week ago, everything was 
going just fine for the UCSD 
bueballteam. The Tritons were 

on a roll, winning 
six games in a 
row and eight out 
of 10. Their slug-

iWH!t¥f1''a gers were hot and 
their pitchers 
were masterful . 
It's amazing how 
things can change 

after one innocent road trip. 
UCSD (16-11) went to The 

~aster's College in hopes of 
continuing its winning ways, 
but instead, it hit a roadblock, 
losing both games of a double· 
header, 7-6 and 6-3. 

In the opener, Steve Height 
started on the mound for the 
Tritons, surrendering two 
earned runs in six innings of 
work. Relief pitcher Theo 
Robbins (0-1) came into the 
game in the seventh and picked 
up the loss. 

"We only had one hit 
through the first six innings," 
Triton Head Coach Robert 

Fletcher said. "Height pitched 
pretty well, but the offense 
wasn't doing anything. There 
weren't [many balls that were 
hit hard]." 

It was a seesaw baltle, but 
at the end of nine innings, the 
Mustangs prevailed, 7-6 . 
UCSD gave up four 'crucial 
runs in the seventh inning, 
thanks mainly to some bad de-
fensive plays. 

"When they scored four 
runs, a couple of balls went 
through [to the outfield],"

tons knew they had to come up big 
in singles to keep their hopes alive 
for Nationals. Unfortunately,these 
hopes were crushed mid-aftemoon 
by the Sagehens.

a tough three-set loss on Saturday,

Therefore, I wish to mandate a

other pro sports. Now, I realize that 
it would be a hard rule to enforce 
given the "spoiled brats" desire to 
look "fly" for the ladies. However,

we must do what is !lec:euary to

I..uckily, we only need to concern 
ourselves with sucb a rule in a se-
lect group of sports. In golf, for ex-
ample, it would be unneceuary. 
Unless you happen to have a pair of 
sighting goggles from an F- t 6 
figbter lying around the house, 
you're only guesstimating wbere to 
aim the ball anyway. Also, the sport 
is so slow, 00 one would ootice if

UCSD Pounds Pomona 
EN MASSE: The Tritons continue to send large numbers to Nationals 
By Tedd Udd 
Sports Editor 

There 's been a lot of talk lately 
about the UCSD track and field 
team. There are conjectures about 

which athletes are 
peaking. There are 
mumblings about 
"big days" and "per-
sonal bests." And yes, 
there's even the ca-
sual mention of that 
'N' word - NCAA 
Nationals. 

But, according to Head Coach 
Tony Salerno, at las I weekend's 
l,OOO-entry Pomona-Pitzer Invita-
tional, his Triton tracksters' "per-
formances spoke for themselves." 

Earnest Clark did the most talk-
ing for the UCSD men, grabbing 
first place in the 400 meters with a 
time of 48.10. It was good enough 
for an automatic NCAA bid. 

Teammate Eryn Houston also 
chalked up a notable finish, taking 
first place in the long jump (22.9'), 
out of a packed field of 22 jump-
ers. Steve Sargent joined the Triton 

headliners with an admirable 
eighth-place performance in the 
high jump (6'6"). 

"The top guy was at seven feet. 
[Sargent) did very well. He's lead-
ing our conference right now," 
Salerno said. 

Also on the men's side, Kirk 
Miller garnered second-place over-
all in the 4OO-meter intermediate 
hurdles (56.62), while fellow Tri-
tons Cliff Marks, Joe Cavan, Juan 
Magdaraog and Clark stormed the 
4 X 100 relay in a near-qualifying 
time of 42.37. 

As for the UCSD women, no 
. event was more a sign of Triton 

dominance t~an the triple jump. 
Kenya Thacker (37'8.7.5"), 
Michele Domico (37'2..5"), Lisa 
Shepard and Renee Sprowl landed 

the first- through fourth-place slots, 
consecutively. 

"The women's triple jump is 
clearly our strongest event overall," 
Salerno said. 

Shepard improved on her 
NCAA-qualifying time in the 100-
meter hurdles with a 14.70 time-
a personal best. Thacker also proved 
she's a two-event star, earning a pro-
visional qualifying mark in the 100-
meter hurdles as well (1.5.27). 

"We have a great deal of talent 
in the hurdle events," Salerno said. 

Veteran standout Michela 
Monahan kept up her winning ways, 
qualifying in the 4OO-meter hurdles 
with a high provisional time of 
63.94. In the open 400 race the pre-
vious week, Monahan qualified 
with a .58.16 time.

The Tritons grabbed control in the

didn't disappoint, nailing a single to 
left to put runners at the corners.

roping a single to right-
center to open the inning. 
Gil then ripped a double 
to deep left field leaving 
Tritons at second and

then benefited from an

Walking Wounded Women Win 
By Dan Sweeney 
Staff Writer 

With all the injuries the UCSD women's ten-
nis team has had lately, Head Coach Liz laPlante 
might suddenly feel as if she is lost in a bad epi-

sodeof"ER." 
However, as Claremont can 

attest, not even injuries can slow 
down the Triton juggernaut -
UCSD defeated its hosts, 6-3, on 
Saturday in its final Division III 
match of the season. 

laPlante's racketeers had to 
make do without Miki Kurikawa, 
the team 's fourth-ranked singles 

player, who sat out with a shoulder injury . 

swiped all three contests in convincing fashion. 
Michelle Malephansukal - suffering from a 

back problem of her own - teamed with Yumi 
Takemoto to dismantle their rivals, Ging-Ging Liu 
and Rosie Coif, at the top doubles spot, 8-5. 

With similar ease, Suzy Drage and Susan 
Huberman clobbered Erika Anhood and Allison 
Mizuo, 8-2, and Morgan Gessford and Hilary 
Somers dispatched Rosie Cella and Julie 
Kirkpatrick, 8-6. 

In contrast to the doubles sweep, the Tritons 
managed to split only the sin$les, winning ~hree 
out of the six matches. Number-three Somers, 
who is playing with a stress fracture in her foot, 
grabbed a marathon win from Liu,.6-3, 6-7; 6-4, 

Other Triton conquests came in the play of 
number-four Gessford, who stomped Coif, 6-1, 
6-3, and number-five Takemoto, who retired Cella 

Her absence was not strongly felt, however, 
as the Tritons enjoyed nothing but smooth sail-
ing in the doubles arena. They methodically See W. TENNIS, Page 18 5uzy Drace (above) and suaan Huberman won convlnclnCly In doubles, 8-2.

No Contact 
Football 

A recent incident in an 
NBA game has thrown me into 
a state of extreme internal 
strife on the issue of contact 
lens in sports. It was Sacra-
mento King Olden Polynice 
who provided me with this 
food fo r thought which has 
kept me munching vigorously 
fo r two weeks now. 

Mr. Polynice was occupy-
ing himself on offense when he 
was struck from behind. He 
quickly assumed an all -too-
familiar pose, crawling about 
on all fours like a baby in 
search of its pacifier. What was 
it that Polynice sought? Why 
hi right contact, of course. 

Olden then stood up, his 
contact tightly clenched in his 
right hand. He proceeded 
down court, where he casually 
blocked the shot of an 
opponent with his firmly 
closed hand prone at his side. 
Now, while this tale of humor 
and heroism may strike the 
viewing public innocently 
enough, it has been a source of 
intense internal debate for me. 

Imagine this worse case 
scenario: The NBA Finals. 
Game seven. Five seconds 
remaining and no time-outs for 
either team. The Orlando 
Magic have the ball trailing by 
one against the Seattle . 
Supersonics. As Horace Grant 
attempts to inbound the ball, 
Shaq is solidly boxed out by 
Shawn Kemp, whose 6'9" 
frame manages to dislodge not 
one, but two, of O'Neal's 
contact lenses. 

Unwary of the disaster, 
"Penny" Hardaway looks 
underneath the basket and 
mistakes the Shaq man's look 
of stunned confusion for a 
request for the ball, lobbing it 
over the defense. Unable to 
call time, Shaq goes up for the 
ball and attempts to grab one 
of the three balls dancing in 
front of him. As he comes up

STREAKING: UCSD 
beats UCLA and the 
British N ationaJ team 
By Dan Sweeney 
Senior Staff Writer 

'. With the Western Qualifying 
tournament looming next weekend 
at UC Davis, the UCSD women's 

water polo team knows 
that its final few games 
are crucia l tune-ups. 
Weekend contests 
against the Great Brit-
ain National team and 
UCLA were the fi rst 
two battles in tPUs Tri-
ton stretch run toward 

the playoffs. . 
UCSD Head Coach Denny 

Harper and his band of rifle-armed 
aquatic warriors managed to beat 
both teams, an indication that his 
squad is poised to defend its USA 
National Championship. 

The Tritons (14-2), who had 
bested the Bruins earlier in the sea-
son by a 6-3 tally, started weakly 
against UCLA on Saturday, looking 
a little slow on the offensive end in 
the early going. 

"As I was afraid of, we came out. 
flat from the start," Harper said. 
"We were lethargic from our game 
against the British National team." 

UCLA took advantage, posting 
the first score of the game when De-
von Brewer hurled one past Triton 
goalie Leona Mason for a 1-0 ad-
vantage. The lead was short-lived, 
since 30 seconds later Jennifer 
Payne lofted a picture-perfect alley-
oop pass to Shawna Caballero, who 
punched the ball into the cage to 
knot the contest at 1-1. 

With 2:49 left in the first, Payne

contributed a goal of her own, a la-
ser-beam shot that put the home 
team ahead 2-1 . 

Again, the second period began 
with UCSD unable to score. Finally, 
with 4:38 left in the 

ever. 
Dana Byrd then took over, scor-

ing the Tritons' next two goals. Her 
first was a rocket shot that was

UCSD came out of the blocks 

quickly to begin the second half, as 
Payne netted her second goal of the 
game in the first minute. UCLA's 
Stephanie Natcher matched it, how-

save by Payne and scored. The third 
period closed with the Tritons hold-
ing on to a comfortable 7-3 lead. 

Caballero clinched the 8-3 vic-
tory with the only goal of the fourth 
period, an unbelievable rainbow 

shot that nestled into the comer of 
the goal - this despite the pressure 
of two defenders in her face. 

"I wasn ' t worried going into this 
game." Harper said. "The game was 
never in doubt. " 

Coming into the Bruin battle, 
UCSD had squeaked out an 11-10 
win the day before against the Great 
Britain National team, which is 
ranked 12th in the world. 

"It was a big-time win for us," 
said Harper. "They had beaten San 
Diego State, 11-7, on Thursday." 

"The most difficult thing was the 
referees," said Harper. "[On Friday] 
they were not calling anything, but 
[against UCLA] they were whistling 
a lot of nitpicky calls off the ball. It 
was hard to get used to."

Heeb also found himself mired in a
