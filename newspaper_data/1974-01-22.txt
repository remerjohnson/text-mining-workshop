John Weare, UCSD Chemistry Prof. running for Del Mar council seat. 

Student Role in Del Mar 
Election Emphasized 

Two years ago, UCSD students living 
in Del Mar were the determining factor 
in electing an environmentally oriented 
city council. The issues are the same in 
the upcoming March 5 council election 
and UCSD students will again be the 
determining factor according to a 
newly formed student organization . 

Drew Keeling, President of 'UCSD 
Students for a Livable Del Mar', em-
phasized the critical importance of 
having all students living in Del Mar 
r gistered by February 2, the deadl ine 
for voting eligibility in the March 
election. 

Keeling pointed out that over 300 
students provided the margin which 
elec ted council members Richard 
Rypinski and Tom Shepard to the 
council in 1972. 

"Major developers, who have been 
frustrated since that election, are 
pouring money into this contest in the 
hope of regaining control of the city," 
according to Shepard, a former UCSD 
student . 

There are five candidates for the two 
available council seats,.. including: john 

Weare; UCSD Chemistry Professor and 
former Chairman of 'The Friends of Del 
Mar', Nancy Hoover; environmentalist 
and executive assistant to the editor of 
Psychology Today, janice Heinzmann; 
housewife and incumbent mayor , 
Richard Westerwick;' engineer, and 
Richard Rowe; buc;inessman . 

Keeling stated that his organization 
will be calling student residents of Del 
Mar in the next week and a half, 
arranging for voter registrars to contact 
and register students. Any students, 
faculty, or staff interested in ~helping in 
this effort are encouraged to call 755-
0650 or 755-0651 , according to Keeling. 

"There are everal major luxury c~ndominium projects waiting in the 
wing in the hope that construction 
interests will triumph in the coming 
election," states candidate Weare .• 

"We have a unique opportunity in 
Del Mar to create a livable, lively, 
heterogeneous community," said 
Weare . " But in order to sieze this 
opportunity we need the cooperation 
and support of young people who 
make-up almost 20 percent of the 
eligible voters in the city." 

Back Pay Available for 
Vets 

by Chris Rauber 
Veterans at UCSD are still feeling the 

effects of a mix-up in the L.A . Regional 
Veterans Administration office that 
began last August, when a change-over 
'to an advance payment system caused 
chaos in the computers. Many vets 
have received only a few of their 
monthly checks, and some have not 
received any for six months. 

At least forty vets, or one out of every 
eight, at UCSD are among the six 
thousand Southern California veterans 
affected by what Senator Alan Cranston 
has called "a Sf, million disaster." Penny 
Murr, of ·the Veterans Affairs office at 
MC213, is afraid that other vets who 
haven't receiveL their checks just 
haven't bothered to come in for help. 

She urged them to do so, because she 
is sure that she can "get them their 
money." She pointed out that calling 
either the Los Angeles or the San Diego 
VA office is an exercise in futility, 

"h(>('aus~ they don't want to talk to 
ve~(>rans" Th(' only way to str.iighten 

out the mess is to work with her offi e, 
or to enlist the aid of your 
congressman. 

This Information could be of vital 
importance to the 330 veterans on 
campus, and to their 450 dependents, 
because Ms. Murr isn't sure that the 

. confusion is over in the L.A . office. 
Although President Nixon suspended 
the head of the L.A . office, along with 
other personnel, and ordered the staff 
to work on weekends and holidays unti l 
all the tardy checks are delivered, she is 
worried because it's all being done on 
an emergency basis. She wonders what 
will happen next month when things get 
back to normal. Has the computer mix-
up been corrected, or will it be " the 
same damn mess all over again?" 

But 'incompetence" on the part of 
the Veterans Administration isn't Ms. 
Murr's only complaint. She also ob-
jected to the new media's lack of 
interest in the story until very recently. 
Among the offending partie , h aid, 
was the Triton Time

The Energy Crisis: How It's 
Mfecting UCSD 

by James Soto 

UCSD has been using 
more power and paying 
higher rates for it in the past 
couple of years . ..Despite 
this the Physical Plant 
Department has in itiated 
tep to reduce co n-

sumption while still 
maintaining high standards 
of excellence and ef-
ficiency . 

Physical Plant Director 
Robert Butler reported to 
the Triton Times that 
"energy con umption at the 
university was up around 5 
percent over list year ." 
Butler stated, " if there is the 
same trend as the past 20 or 
30 years there will be a 
steady 5 percent increase 
e'very year ." This is not 
allowing for the new 
construction of facilities 
but for the existing plant. 

When a ked what was the 
average power c on -
sumption (in term of 
electricity) of the 
university, Butler answered 
" this i a variable figure 
dependent on the time of 
the year, the weather, and 
whether or not the plant 
was being used at it peak 
capacity." 

Figures for the upper 
campuSJ(Muir, Revelle, and 
Mathews Campus) taken 
from the eight or nine 
meter , bear Butler out on 
power consumption 
averages. The most recent 
figures reported are from 
the month of December 
and the first w ek of 
january. 

During a weekday when 
chool is in session power 

con umption runs about 
210,000 kilowatt hours 
(Kwh) per day. 750 kilowatts 
equals one horsepower . 
During the weekend of 
December 1-2, when chool 
was till in session, power 
consumption dropped to 
175,000 kwh/ day . 

The next weekend was 
the first weekend with no 
sc hool following Monday. 
There was an unexplained 
drop to 122,000 kwh / day. 
Thi drop is till under 
inve tigation . A normal 
weekend during the quarter 
break uses aro1,Jnd 140,000 
kwh/ day. The quarter break 
find a normal busines day 
during the week to use 
around 160,000 kwh/ day 

Th pre ent. budget for 
pow r usage at UCSD 
points the vast volume of 

energy used by the 
university Presently the 
cam pus receive its energ 
from SDG&E . A little over 
1.1 million dollars is pent 
on electricity alone A 
further $350,000 is paid out 
interuptable natural gas It 
IS ca lled interuptable 
because It may be hut off 
by the power company 
when their stocks of natural 
gas are low. Gas, a much 
cheaper energy ource, I 
then replaced by heating or! 
which the univer ity pay 
around 150,000 a year for 

The Physical Plant 
reported no difficulty in 
getting electricity but there 
may be a problem 10 the· 
future as the Public Utilitle 
Commission has requested 
a 15 percent reduction In 
energy use b the major 
customers of the Power 
compa n ies . There hay 
been. periodic problem 
with getting nough gas, 
which powers the Central 
plant and the boilers Last 
year there was a total of 19 
day when natural ga wa 
not available and had to be 
replaced by th much more

Bloodmobile Here Thursday 

Call for Action 
by Rick Drom 

Craig Martin, a CALPIRG 
member, is developing a 
new concept to regain 
publ ic power to the 
people ..... the telephone. 

The telephone has 
become a way of life for 
years but has rarely been 
used as a unifying tool. But 
according to Martin, inside 
the phone lies a powerful 
political and organizational 
tool . 

callers in turn calls 5 or 10 
more people. Within two or 
three levels in the "chain" 
hundreds of writers ar~ 
contacted. 

These writers would just 
be ordinary students and 
citizens who have agreed to 
spend 10 minutes or so 
writing one letter to his or 
her congressman or other 

. elected official. Thus with 
very little structure or time. 
an issue of great im-
portance can be quickly, 
and effectively brought into 
the limelight and the 
public's views known .

NOS'TRALGIA QUIZ 

In response to an appeal for blood donors to help a 15 
year old hemophiliac, Brian Berquist, the San Diego 
Bloodbank Bloodmobile will be on campus this 
Thursday from 10 ,am to 4 pm at the Lower Blake 
Lounge. 

The power of the 
telephone is its ability to 
reach a number of people 
on a particular issue in 
extremely short time. If a 
telephone network among 
interested students and 
citizens could be 
organized. real effects 
could be seen. according to 
Martin . 

Martin is setting up a 
Citizen's Lobby Phone 
Network. It would consist 
basically of two types of 
individuals; callers - and 
writers . This is how he 
envisions it working .. 

As Martin says, "The 
beauty of the whole project 
is this : - The citizens in-
volved may spend five or 
ten minutes writing a letter 
and eight cents to mail it. 
But if hundreds of people 
are involved. think of the 
effect this would have on a 
conscientious legislator." 

The following fifteen questions are deSigned to test 
and tax the reader's knowledge of now-legendary 
movies and TV programs. The questions require an eye 
capable of discerning detail ranging from the obvious to 
the subliminal. The questions were purposely made 
difficult in order to keep too many people with trivial 
minds from winning. However. since this would not be 
fai! to those of you whose minds are mostly lost in a 
haze of mathematical permutations and calculations, a 
few easy ones have been inclUded. Thus, the lowest 
acceptable score will be one more than the number of 
obvious questions. 

Because of a recent surgery, Berquist has used over 
1200 pints of blood since last December. Under normal 
circumstances, Berquist requires 6 units of blood per 
day. An immediate project 

comes into the public view; 
for example news that an 
atomic power plant will be 
decided or rejected in three 
days at a hearing. Since 
there is no time for a 
questionnaire or election 
to tell our officials how 
citizens really feel , the 
network goes to work . 

Personal, non - form 
letters can have a great 
impact on elected officials 
(as Common Cause and the 
Connecticut Citizens-
Action Group, who each 
have similar plans. has 
shown) . They are much 
more effective than 
petitions or form letters; 
both of which have less

Energy Crisis 
The cost of all this power 

has been rising the last two 
years . The average increase 
in cost has been around 10 
percent the last two years . 
In some instances some of 
the rates for certain types of 
power have been rai sed by 
20 percent. 

These increases in power 
costs as well as a desi re to 
save energy and requ ests 
that the university cut down 
on its energy use has 
spurred the Physica l Plant 
Department to look for 
means of cutting power use. 

Robert Butler told the 
Tri ton Times that "the bulk 
of electricity us d on

but rather in motors and 
heaters where most of the 
~avings can be made".

Concert Notes 

IN CONCERT -Vocalist-guitarist Cordon Lightfoot will ' 
present his speCial brand of folk music next Friday night' 
in an 8 p.m. concert in the San Diego Civic Theater. 

Lightfoot, who won gold records for his hit songs "If 
You Could Reild My Mind" and "Early Morning Rain," 
also reached the top of the popularity charts with his 
mor recent albums "Don Quixote" and "Old Dan's 
Records." A prolific writer, lightfoot's roots are in 
country a well as folk music with such hits as "Second 
Cup of Coffee," "It's Worth Believing" and "Cotton 
jenny."

Moliere, the Light of Paris (a few year ago), is noted 
for his keen wit, cynical understanding of Mankind. and 
somewhat involved humor. His plays are funny , in-
te lligent crit iques on the follies, hypocrisies, and af-
fectations of people . One of his most noted plays is 
Tartuffe, the tale of an every~ay religious hypocrite 
who is in reality a lecherous "seventeenth century 
confidence trickster ." 

The Old Globe Theatre is presenting Tartuffe in the 
Cassius Carter Centre Stage . It is a difficult play to do, 
being originally staged as a spectacle for Louis XIV. in 
verse. But Moliere's message is universal and time-less . 
and a fine translation by Richard Wilbur has preserved 
both the verse and the wit of the play. 

Direc~or Charles Vernon, noted for many brilliant 
productions at the Globe. has done a marvellous job 
once again . Although the opening scene is slow 
(primarily because this scene is wordy without sufficient 
action), the pace soon picks up and is maintained 
throughout the rest of the show. 

Peggy Kellner's set and costumes are imminently 
worth mentioning, as their intricacy and ap-
propriateness added much to the shows success. They 
are bright. gaudy, and colorful , well fitting the mood 
and characters. 

A strong cast delivers the pith of the play with en-
thusiasm. Lyman Saville is Orgon , a wealthy, pious 
gentleman who is used and abused by Ron Ray as 
Tartuffe. Mr. Saville fits the role well , having a good 
comedy approach to hischangeablecharacter.Mr. Ray is 
very strong as Tartuffe, calm and collected as the sternly 
pious con-man, but quite funny as the guilible would-be 
lover to Elmire. 

Julia Shelly, as Elmire. Orgon 's wife, does some very 
nice things with an interesting role . She is charming, 
funny. warm , teasing, and sensible. Gail West Brown. as 
her daughter. Mariane. also displays many of these 
qualities. She is a typical dizzy young lady, but can be 
very warm and sincere when a scene calls for it. 

But the best female role is that of the maid. Dorine, 
who manipulates the plot and characters quite well, 
with the exception , of course, of Tartuffe. Gail Mackler 
plays Dorine with ebulliance, keeping the laughs loud 
and frequent whenever she is on stage. A delightfully 
non-subtle character .

first hit single, "Sunshine" pulled from his debut album 
was uncomfortably simi lar to much of James Taylor 's 
"Sweet Baby James" material but no more. Now there's 
no hint of simple mimickry. Jon has become a fine 
performer and. more so. an organizer and producer of 
the first rank . 

On this. his third LP. he's backed by the likes of 
Poco ' George Grantham . NRBQ's AI Anderson and 
David Bromberg. The album avoids dependence on one 
facet of the mu ical whole . I nstrumentally all solos are 
brief and to the point. Most notable are Bromberg's 
contributions. first on dobro on "Rollin Along," a 
mellow "Take It Easy" type tune, then on mandolin for 
"Travelin Blues." the old Jimmie-Rogers good-time song 
with a new arrangement , and then finally on electric 
gui tar on the excellent "Hall of Fame." 

Overall the record 's marked by consistency of quality 
and diversity of material. Unlike many pop albums, 
there's never a moment when one fee ls as if they're 
passing a melody heard a few songs before. 

The coup~e-gr'cke of this album though. Its essential 
excellence, comes from its production by Jon and Peter 
Casperson and its subtly aware engineering by J. 
Messina (?) . The album touches so many emotional 
levels (joy. sadness. loneliness, love) so truely, so 
directly. Sometimes it seems almost orchestral in its 
tone colors and moods. . 

Personal favorites? Forget it , they're all good . This 
album is the best country-inspired pop album in many 
months. Like Eagles. Pure Prairie League, Nesmith. 
Jackson Browne and a few other notables walking that 
same country-western-pop-rock line, this music has a 
way of bringing joy to the heart. and for some. of 
bringing peace to the soul.

I FEEL SO BAD, Eddie Taylor-Advent 2802 

I Feel So Bad is easily superior to any city blues album 
released in 1973. I'm tempted to include nearly 
everything released since the heyday of Chess Records 
way back in the 50's but maybe that you wouldn't 
believe . .' 

Eddie Taylor has a distinctive, impassioned blues 
voice and his instrumental technique equals the very 
best bluesme~ in both tone and dexterity. He's very 
lightfingered a;id capably ornaments his melodies so 
that it sounds as if he uses two notes for every' one of 
other bluesmen. 

In the 50 years since his birth in Benoit, Mississippi . 
Eddie's played with Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf, 
Elmore James and for many years backed jimmy Reed . 
In fact. Eddie says he taught Jimmy "Big Boss Man" 
Reed to play guitar . 

On I Feel So Bad Eddie's backed by the L.A . based 
Philip Walker band . Walker's group is experienced in 
the extreme and have, incidentally, a very good album 
of their own on Playboy Records . On Eddie's LP Philip 
and Co . play the proper role of accompaniment and do 
so quite well . Philip's own often hyper technique 
established the basic melodic structure over which 
Eddie embroiders and embellishes creating a musically 
dynamic whole. 

"Stop Breaking Down" is one example of the 
aforpmentioned method and the traditional i< here

given the best reading in my experience_ The album 
avoids that standard weakness of blues albums. rhyth-
mic repetition "Stroll Oul West" is a fine little acoustic 
boogie hip- hake number. "Highway 13" is a slow blues 
out of the "Every~y" mold. "Wreck on 83 Highway" IS 
equally. -ffit>ffl6r3bte;--actua1t'y The en t ire album works 
Wf'1I and entertai ns thoroughly 

listening to I Feel So Bad more than once reminded 
me of those reat 50's Chess sides by Jimmy Rogers [not 
Jimmie) That strength of expression is one In large part 
missing from the blues scene si nce that time. Here 
though . in the form of Eddie Taylor. is a definitive 
restatement of Chicago blues at its very best. it's a good 
'un

Danish Gymnasts 
The twenty young men 

and women of the Danish 
Gymnastic Team displayed 
their talents in the gym 
Wednesday evening . These 
Danes, whose occupations 
range from farmer to 
economist, are currently on 
tour throughout California, 
Oregon , Washington and 
Arizona. 

The greater part of th is 
performance consisted of 
modern dance routines 
varying from Swedish ball 
gymnastics (a form of 
ballet) to a presentation of 
every possible variation of 
the handstand. 

One of the highli~hts of 
the evening was the folk 
dancing in native costume 
ending in a comic per~ 
formance by two of the 
men. 

For the final presen. 
tation, the male members 
of the team exhibited 
amazing forms of flying 
cartwheels and somersaults ' 
in synchronized rhythm. 
Phenom~nal skill and speed 
was shown on the vaulting 
horse. 

With their rhythm and 
grace, this team of Danes 
made the hardest stunts 
seem easy. 

Surprises in All-Cal 
Among the many 

exhibitions of prowess in 
sports exhibited last 
weekend was the AII-Cal 
Volleyball Tournament 
won by the UCLA Bruins . It 
is not that this win was so 
unexpected, but instead 
was the difficulty which the 
Bruins ,and second place 
UCSB had in beating the 
rest of the participants . 

Both UCI and UCSD 
made the two top teams 
work for their wins in the 
semi-final round of that 
tournament . The Tritons 
who finished fourth : 
stretched the Gauchos to 
three sets a nd gave the 
team from the north a scare 
as they almost upset this 
nationally ranked team in 
the semis, 9-11, 11-1, 11-7. 

Irvine also won its first 
set with the Bru ins but 
were defeated by' the 
superior hitting and setting 
of UCLA as well as their 

own .nconslstence. Irvine 
did, however, finish third. 

The final match paired 
the two teams that were 
expected to dominate the 
tourney in a battle of 
champions . In the earlier 
round robin part of the 
tournament, UCSB had 
defeated UCLA two straight 
sets, so the Gauchos had to 
be favored. 

As expected the Gauchos 
took early command of 
play, led by their top hitter 
Jon Roberts, but were not 
able to keep the ' con-
sistency that they had had 
throughout the tourney . 

UCLA was led by some 
spectacular digging and 
hitting by veterans Jimmy 
Mengas, Mike Norman, 
John "Milo" Beakins and 
Denny Klein . The Score 
reflects the closeness of the 
battle as UClA finally came 
up with the victory, 15-9, 7-
15, 15-13.

discredit of conservative 
nitpickers everywhere . 
Probably the interest rates 
looked unattractive to 
banks, so nobody with any 
major lobby felt threatened 
at the time . 

At the same time, state 
systems of higher education 
enjoyed an explosive 
growth in their funding and 
enrollment, with fees much 
less than at private in-
stitutions. Thus, two events 
that might seem rather 
innocent separately took on 
a rather suspicious 
character in conjunction . 
One was rather radical 
because of its scope and 
oddity in the home of free 
enterprise; millions of 
people, all over the nation, 
were being refused business 
because they had a little 
too much money. The other 
was an acceleration of a 
long process in which the 
price of a commodity long 
cons idered quite valuable 
was being made more 
attractive at state in-
stitutions than at private 

institutio~s . A cynic's in-
..terpretation of the motive 
for such action would be : 
overall averages on tests 
like the SAT for public high 
schools have dropped a 
good deal in the last 
decade-maybe somebody 
wants to make the com-
pletion of this fine job 
available to a greater 
percentage of the 
population. A few less 
sarcastic remarks have 
issued from the typewriter 
of Anthony Burgess, whom 
readers may remember as 
the fellow who sold the film 
rights to one of Kubrick's 

generally been cast as 
waging a crusatle again~ 
elements of the U .c. 
system. But he also ~eem~ 
to like the idea of 
preserving private colleges 
(the two purpose<; are 
hardly mutually exclusive); 
he's made commenls about 
them that seem dlfficuit to 
relate to from the vantage 
of most U .c. students 
(except that there's a lot of 
red brick at U.C.l.A.) 

I see no point in arguing 
the worth of what the 
private' colleges provide in 
their curriculum . Mdtters of 
taste seldom get settlecJ. by 
games of reason . If th ings 
£:et bad enough, all manner 
of things they provided may 
be found, like ones liver, to 
be missed. If the only 
alternative to state schools 
were the free university sort 
of classes, things would 
seem rather grim. Maybe 
the people affected by the 
loan regulations will form a 
big enough lobby to get 
things corrected, but not for 
some time. At any rate, 
there seems to be 
something gone crazy with 
the system of hoops to 
jump through in order for 
the various service 
organizations arollnd to 
notice one, and mildly 
ironic since so many 
legislators try to keep some 
things as Puritanical and 
Capitalistic as the courts 
say the Constitution allows, 
when there's more securify 
in becoming a gay junkie in 
the Bay Area than a grad 
student at R~d .

Ruggers Split 
Two 

UC . San Diego's big 
br(Jther from Westwood 
challenged the Triton 
rugg~rs to a pair of rugby 
games last Saturday. The 
UCLA Bruins came in 
bringing three teams, and a 
host of trainers, coaches , 
stati stians, wives, 
girlfriends, and children . 

A large and enthusiastic 
crowd of UCSD fans turned 
out for the game, despite 
somewhat less than ex-
ceptional atmospheric 
conditions. The excitement 
began at noon, as the Triton 
second team took the field 
against the Bruin thirds . The 
Bruins were generally in 
very good phYSical shape, 
but lacking in experience. 

The backs were evenly 
matched, but the forwards 
gave an unbeatable ad-
vantage to UCSD. The 
Tritons won 13 out of 15 set 
serums, pushing the Bruins 
all over the field . Good 
pursu it by the forwards 
helped shut-<>ff the op-
position offense . 

Rookie rugger Mark lewis 
scored first for the Tritons 
on an unaSSisted 40 yard 
tkkn . With pride, the Bruins 
battled back, but were 
frustrated by the experience 
of John Berteaux, and Bill 
Me is ter, and th e sur-
priSingly aggressive play of 
Peter Sertic. 

In the second half, Kevin 
levon scored on a quick 
heads-up play from 5 yards 
out. Von Jezeraine kicked 
the conversion, and then 
minutes later, booted an 
easy penalty award . Final 
score : Tritons, 13 - Bruins, 
O. 

In the big game of the 
day, the experienced and 
respected UCLA first team 
lined up against the 
determined Triton firsts . 
The Bruins powered into 
the rugger.s with strong and 
consistent play. The Tritons 
held back their offense, for 
a good part of the first half, 
but UCLA set up several 
tries to take a commanding 
lead. 

Rugger Dugger and Dave 
"Why Me?" Clark, held off 
the Bruin attack with a fine 
display of kicking ability. 
Herman liebow and Brent 
lloyd moved the ball for 

It was generally agreed 
by ruggers and fans alike 
that both ~ames were most 
enjoyable and that it had 
been an afternoon of fine 
rugby. Next week UCSD 
plays' host to the Cal State 
long Beach traveling rugby 
circus and glee club. 

Women's Rugby 
Team 

The turn out for the 
women'~ rugby meeting was 
considerable for such a new 
sport . A few male ruggers 
were on hand to organize 
the girls; and will teach 
them the rules (subject to 
change for women) and 
techniques of this fast 
moving sport . Other than 
through coaching, though, 
the women ruggers will not 
be officially associated with 
the men's team. 

At the present time, there 
are only three other 
women's intercollegiate 
teams in the state. Cal State 
Northridge was the first 
school to have a full-
fledged team last year. 
Although Santa Barbara had 
a make-shift team last year, 
an official team is being 
organized this season . 
SDSU is also forming a team 
this year . 

As well as playing each of 
these universities , the 
Tritons will participate in 
the rugby tournament April 
13 & 14 at Santa Barbara. 
The women's teams will 
play a round robin - the 
two top teams meeting 
between the two men's 
championship games. 

The object of this game is 
to have a good time. So, 
cIon't be timid . If you 
missed the meeting, come 
out to the rugby field today 
at 5 p.m . for the first 
practice of the season . 

Crisis 
reductions in the decorative 
lighting and~ the shutting 
down of the fountains in 
Revelle Plaza . In -
vestigations are now going 
on with the Parking Service 
and the Police Department 
to see which lights in 
parking lots may be turned 
off. Tentatively the I ights in 
the South Revelle lot wilt 
be turned off at midnight. 
This lot serves primarily 
commuters and commuting 
staff . 

The PUC has required 
that heat may not be used 
to raise the temperature 
above 68 degrees cooling 
systems may not be used to 
bring the temperature 
below 78 ~egrees . These 
regulations have been 
complied with except for 
those buildings that require 
certain tem peratures 
(computers and labs 
primarilvl. The PUC has 

continued from paKe 2 
also requested that all lights 
not necessary be turned off. 
This has been done in office 
buildings but cannot be 
done in buildings like 
Bonner and Mayer Hall 
where research is a con-
tinuous process. 

The Physical Plant has 
not had any major com-
plaints and have found 
everybody generally 
coop rative with their staff . 
There have even been some 
offers of help from some 
professors . Members of the 
Physi cs Department have 
inquired about employing 
solar heaters for the 
swimming pools and other 
buildings. 

Mr. Butler said he hoped 
that perhaps there could be 
federal grant on the use of 
Solar Power on campus and 
that he would try to be of 
assistance to anyone in· 
terested in such a project . 

Faculty A warded 
Six members of the Third College faculty at the 

University of California, San Diego have been awarded 
the first " Provost-Third College Faculty Research 
Grants" in recognition of their substantial contributions 
to the development and operation of the college and to 
the education and general welfare of its students. 

This year's recipients are: Dr. Edward Alexander, 
Assistant Professor of Chemistry; Dr. Carlos Blanco, 
Professor of Spanish Literature; Dr. Arthur F. Diaz, 
Assistant Professor of Chemistry; Dr. Ramon Pinon, Jr., 
Assistant Professor of Biology; Dr. Michael Real , 
Assistant Professor of Communications; and Dr. John 
Waterhouse, Assistant Professor of English literature. 

Alexander, Diaz and Pinon are associated with Third 
College's Science and Technology Program, Blanco with 
the Third World Studies Program, and Real and 
Waterhouse with the college~s Communications 
Program.

Steve Mackey, as Orgon's son, Damis, has a nasty habit 
of smiling when he should be frowning, smirking when 
he should be angry, and a questionable delivery of 
many lines. The other male juvenile, John Herring, is 
Mariane's fiance, Valare. Mr. Herring is well suited for 
his part , mincing through his scenes in a blatant parody 
of the stereotyped , effeminate yo'ung French noble of 
that age. 

Tartuffe is a good show to be played i n a large, 
melodramatic manner, and Mr. Vernon and his actors 
have met the challenge of a difficult show tremen-
dously . I recommend Tilrfuffe to any theatre goer, as 
having a lot to offer beyond mere entertainment. 

Curtain is at 8:()() nightly except Mondays at the 
Cassius Carter Centre Stage. Check the Globe box office 
for matinees. 

h its for SSOO. Burgess sent 
an open letter to his 
students to the New York 
Times, telling them to find 
out who Nausicaa was and 
warning against the 
downfall of standards in the 
humanities. He seems 
worried that an erosion of 
the facilities of lang\lage 
among the public at large 
and even among college 
graduates is playing into the 
hands of sinister forces in 
the government, although 
he doesn't have any 
conspiracy theory with 
notes on the Warren 
Report . This ties in for 
people who've kept count 
of word games at both 
private I iberal arts colleges 
and state institutions (e.g., 
Occidental and Revelle). 
It's not the sort of thing that 
makes one lose sleep 
nights, but to some people 
who aren't entir Iy certain 
all one needs to run a 
country i enough trained 
technicians, it might be an 
eerie point to ponder.
