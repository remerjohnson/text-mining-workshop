WASHINGTON, D.C. — During 
his State of the Union address to a 
divided U.S. Congress last Tuesday, 
President Obama outlined steps to 
strengthen the middle class through 
education and immigration reform.

Obama’s 2013 budget plan estab-
lished funding for federal programs in 
science, technology, engineering and 
mathematics — or STEM — education 
at $3 billion, which rose by 2.6 percent 
since last year. With it, the president 
set a government-wide goal to increase 
the number of STEM graduates by 
one-third, or one million, over the 
next decade.

According to the most recent 
UCSD student profile, more than half 
of the 22,600 undergraduates in fall of 
2012 were majoring in STEM fields. By 
2022, if Obama’s goal succeeds, UCSD 
would add over 3,800 more STEM 
students, about the current size of 
Thurgood Marshall College or under-
graduates in the Division of Biological 
Sciences.

Obama justified his plan by 
announcing the demand of over 2.1 
million STEM-related jobs over the 
same period. About 1.3 million alone 
are computer specialist related.

Also near the top of the list was 
Obama’s urge for Congress to reform 
the Higher Education Act, which 
determines how schools receive federal 
aid. It is scheduled for a reauthoriza-
tion this year.

“Colleges must do their part to 
keep costs down,” Obama said. “It’s our 
job to make sure they do so.”

The proposed reform would 
account for affordability and value in 
determining which colleges receive 
certain types of federal funding, simi-
lar to his Race to the Top program with 
K-12 schools.

Last Wednesday, his administra-
tion released a “College Scorecard” 
on WhiteHouse.gov to make cam-
pus comparisons. It is a standardized 
report used to decide “where you can 
get the most bang for your educational 
buck,” he said during the speech.

Though there is not an actual score, 
per se, the scorecard reports details 
like net costs, graduation rates, default 
loan rates and median borrowing. It is 
expected to also report employment 
statistics, including graduate salary 
data, when available.

For example, according to the 
scorecard, UCSD’s graduation rate is 
higher than the national average, while 
the percentage of students who default 
on student loans is much lower than

UCSD alumnus Steven Lau 
returned to campus on Feb. 11 to give 
a tech talk about Google X’s Project 
Glass, where he works as a senior soft-
ware engineer and project leader. 

The talk was held in the Computer 
Science and Engineering building, 
Room 1202, where most tech talks 
take place. The room, which seats 
about 150, was packed with over 200 
students by the time the event started 
at 7 p.m. 

Lau graduated from Revelle College 
in 2001 with a bachelor’s degree in 
computer science and received his 
master’s degree in computer science 
from UCSD through the five-year 
master’s program. After working at 
several large and small startup busi-
nesses, he joined Google X about eight 
months into the project.

Governor Brown Releases 
Details on Education Plan
While campuses will see more funding, analysts say it may not be enough.

BY  h ei di  ki m  Senior Staff Writer

Gov. Jerry Brown released budget proposals earlier this month for California’s higher edu-cation systems that would increase funding 
for the University of California, the California State 
University system, and the California Community 
Colleges system.

As stated in Gov. Brown’s report, the funding 
increases would be used for improvements through-
out these higher education systems. The funds would 
be distributed to paying debts, employee pension 
costs and community colleges, as reported by the 
San Francisco Chronicle on Feb. 12. Brown’s 40-page 
report was released on Feb. 12.

Gov. Brown asked the California Legislature to 
pass a $1.4 billion increase for the 2013–2014 fiscal 
school year; this is a 13 percent increase in funding 
from the 2012–2013 fiscal year. The UC system in 
total would receive a $250 million increase, with $10 
million for each UC and CSU campus. Community 
colleges would receive up to $16.9 million to fund 
more online courses.

However, nonpartisan policy advisor at the 
Legislative Analyst’s Office criticized Gov. Brown’s 
proposals and said many of the goals could be 
reached with existing resources. Instead of providing 
$10 million for each campus to expand online educa-
tion, LAO suggests a low-cost $1 million instead to 
widen the use of existing courses.

A Feb. 16 opinion piece in The Daily Californian 
argues that Gov. Brown’s plans to improve higher 
education are vague and are seen as “undefined 
performance expectations” because the funds are 
“unallocated.” The state legislative analyst questioned 
Gov. Brown’s proposal, as this year’s increases in 

funding toward the public higher education system 
had unclear expectations.

LAO said that Gov. Brown’s proposal had good 
general topics but that it lacked details regarding 
what improvements the funding would be allocated 
toward. The legislative analyst suggested that extra 
funding should be used to improve enrollment and 
student performance.

Brown’s proposal also received criticism from 
the office for taking “key higher-education deci-
sions out of the Legislature’s control,” as LAO wrote 
in its review. Because of the unclear distribution of 
increased funds and the expectations that follow, 
analysts do not agree that the proposal should pass.

Another major concern was the topic of tuition. 
Gov. Brown proposed a tuition freeze that would keep 
tuition from increasing for the next four years. While 
this may seem like a favorable proposal to current 
students, the analyst’s office disagreed with the plan, 
arguing that future students might be hit hard with 
tuition increases. The office asked the legislature to 
reject Brown’s proposal, for the analysts said it could 
likely lead to steep tuition increases in the coming 
years if another economic struggle arrives.

The San Diego Union-Tribune reported Feb. 13  
that LAO said that California students currently pay 
roughly 30 percent of UC and CSU costs and 6 per-
cent of community college costs through tuition, after 
state and financial aid distributed to students.

“When the state’s done it in the past, usually it 
keeps for a couple years, but when there’s another 
economic downturn, then you’ll see a huge spike in

Former Mayor Gambling:

 
Former San Diego Mayor 

Maureen O’Connor is being accused 
of misappropriation of funds and 
money embezzlement to fuel a nine-
year gambling habit, according to 
federal prosecutors. O’Connor, who 
has pleaded not guilty to her charges 
of misappropriation, was given a 
deferred prosecution and possible 
dropped charges under a plan that 
requires her to repay the $2 million 
taken from her husband’s non-profit 
organization during her billion-dol-
lar gambling period.

O’Connor, 66, was described as 
frail and of poor health during her 
court appearance on Thursday; she 
is currently in “destitute” financial 
condition, having a fortune between 
$40 and $50 million at one point, 
and a net gambling loss of $13 mil-
lion after playing in San Diego, Las 
Vegas, and Atlantic City casinos.

 
San Diego Festival of Science 

and Engineering:
 
After receiving a National Medal 

of Science award from President 
Obama in 2011, Shu Chien, direc-
tor of the Institute of Engineering 
in Medicine and UCSD professor of 
bioengineering and medicine, has 
been selected as the chief engineer 
of the 2013 San Diego Festival of 
Science and Engineering. 

The festival, March 16 to 
March 23, is being produced by 
the BIOCOM Institute, a nonprofit 
organization and is the largest fes-
tival of technology and innovation 
in Southern California. It includes 
over 40 activities, events and dem-
onstrations. 

UCSD will participate in six of 
the festival events, host 19 booths, 
and provide 13 speakers including 
speakers from UCSD will include 
Tara Hutchinson, mechanical engi-
neer, and Todd Coleman, bioengi-
neer.

 
82-Year-Old Woman

Kills Roommate:
 
Barbara Brand, an 82-year-old 

woman, has been sentenced to 10 
years in prison after shooting and 

killing her roommate, Paul Slysh, Jr., 
inside their Morena Boulevard Bay 
Park trailer home last July.  

Brand shot Slysh several times 
with a gun that belonged to her 
deceased husband, after he made 
insulting remarks about her grand-
daughter. She then reported her act 
to the authorities and was taken 
into custody, pleading guilty to 
voluntary manslaughter. Slysh, 57, 
who suffered from paranoia and 
schizophrenia, died two days after 
the shooting; Brand and Slysh had 
known each other since 1984, and 
were said to have had a strained, 
mother-son relationship.

 
Comic-Con Sells Out:

 
Online admission tickets, includ-

ing four-day passes and single day 
passes, to this year’s July Comic-
Con International, sold out in less 
than two hours; last year, the tickets 
were sold in a record one hour and 
20 minutes. 

The San Diego Convention 
Center, which has outgrown its 
capacity to accommodate attendees, 

is hoping to undergo an expansion 
after approval from the California 
Coastal Committee. Currently, the 
city-approved, $520 million plan 
is awaiting a hearing to confirm 
whether or not hotel room sur-
charges to finance the construction 
are legal.

The annual convention, which 
attracts nearly 130,000 fans and 
totals $67.8 million in lodging, 
meals, transportation, and related 
expenses, will stay in San Diego 
through 2016. 

Baby Killer Whale:
 
After nearly 18 months of preg-

nancy, 37-year-old killer whale 
Kasatka gave birth at SeaWorld, 
according to the SeaWorld zoologi-
cal team. 

The calf, born at 6:30 a.m. on 
Valentine’s Day inside of Shamu 
Stadium, is estimated to weigh 
between 300 and 350 pounds and 
measures between 6 and 7 feet long. 
Currently, the newborn orca’s gen-
der is unknown; it will be named at 
a later date.

the average American campus.
Rep. Judy Chu (D-Pasadena), who 

has had a career in education, was 
hesitant to endorse the proposals in 
the president’s address, but reassured 
California college students during 
an interview at Statuary Hall in the 
Capitol following the speech.

“We will have to see how the col-
lege ratings will ultimately work out, 
but I’m hopeful that California will 
be one of the most competitive,” she 
said. “The University of California is a 

leader in education.”
To grow the middle class beyond 

education, Obama stated the econ-
omy is stronger when the best tal-
ent is harnessed. He applauded the 
bipartisan efforts of both chambers 
of Congress in drafting comprehen-
sive immigration bills similar to his 
proposals. The bills would include 
a pathway to citizenship for high-
ly-skilled workers or graduates in 
various fields of STEM as well as 
increase the number of visas for both 
categories.

Rep. Ami Bera (D-Sacramento) 

said the president’s proposals on 
immigration and education go hand 
in hand and can provide hope for 
future STEM graduates.

“Jobs are growing in these fields 
and California, as a center for high-
skilled immigrants and technology, 
will only contribute to its innovation,” 
he said after Obama’s speech.

California Republicans could not 
be reached for comment at the time 
of inquiries.

tuition,” LAO higher education analyst 
Paul Golaszewski said. “What we think 
is a better idea is doing moderate, 
steady increases. They are predictable 
and would help decrease volatility.”

The office of analysts suggested 
that low-cost programs should be uti-
lized while there is still room to cut 
the UC system’s budget. According 
to the analyst’s report, average per-
student spending on UC campuses is 
over 20 percent higher than at other 

public universities. LAO hopes that 
the legislature will take into account 
its own report reviewing Brown’s pro-
posals.

overseen by Google’s co-founder 
Sergey Brin and works on future tech-
nologies, such as the self-driving car 
and Project Glass.

“What Google X is trying to do 
is change humanity,” Lau said. “The 
primary goal is solving big problems.”

Project Glass, in its simplest form, 
is a pair of glasses with a battery, com-
puter chips and an integrated heads-
up display, or HUD — a transparent 
display in a person’s line of sight. It 
is Google’s attempt to bring wearable 
computing to the mass market. Glass 
can do almost everything a smart-
phone can, including give directions, 
receive notifications, take pictures, 
mediate social networking, and inter-
act via voice recognition. Lau repeat-

edly compared Project Glass to a driv-
er’s rear view mirror to describe the 
transparent display.

Lau shared a story of a time when 
he was at dinner with his friends and 
family and everyone was on their 
phones. He explained that one of the 
main goals of Glass is to bring back 
human-to-human contact by moving 
social notifications into constant view 
and removing the phone, allowing 
people to look up and converse with 
others. Lau believes Glass is the next 
step in the evolution of communica-
tion and information that introduced 
devices like the telegraph and smart-
phone to the masses.

When asked what the hardest part 
of developing Glass was, Lau pointed 
to the miniaturization of components 
into something wearable. He said the 

Glass team worked to create a new 
prototype almost every two months, 
starting from scratch every time.

Lau also pointed to the scope of 
the user interface (UI). He said the 
team constantly added, stripped away 
and redesigned features and design 
elements.

“I think I’ve written seven UI’s and 
thrown out six,” Lau said. 

At last year’s Google I/O devel-
oper conference, the company took 
pre-orders from developers of Project 
Glass for $1500 of what they called the 
“explorer edition.” Lau said preorders 
of the developer edition will ship later 
this year, followed by a later commer-
cial release.

Keep It on the Shelves

QuIck  TAkEs A recent study by university of chicAgo’s booth school of business reports thAt the need to check sociAl mediA websites like fAcebook is more Addicting thAn consuming cigArettes And Alcohol.

It’s conventionally known that cigarettes and 
alcohol are habit forming, but according to new 
research there’s a new, more addictive recreational 
substance out there — Facebook. However, con-
stantly checking Facebook is not a diagnosable 
problem, but a reflection of the social media age 
that we currently live in.

There is always that one friend who checks 
their phone everywhere: during dinner, in the 
movies (jerks) and while driving. They claim 
they have an “addiction,” but what they are 
really suffering from is FoMO, a Fear of Missing 
Out — a phenomenon that sounds like texting 
jargon but is actually a psychological concept 
introduced by Dr. Dan Herman. This is a fear 
of possibly living life in an incorrect or boring 
way. Facebook exacerbates FoMO because it pro-
vides a constant feed of what others are doing. 
According to psychologist John Grohol, check-
ing social media is not so much an addiction 
but an impulse to ensure that something “more 
important” isn’t happening at the time.

Social media has become so prevalent that 
according to Forbes Senior Online Editor Kashmir 
Hill, people who don’t have Facebook accounts are 
viewed with suspicion. Not having a strong social 
media presence is a unifying trait of mass murder-
ers such as Anders Breivik and James Holmes, 
according to technology website Slashdot. People 
who don’t have accounts may raise social red 
flags. That kind of peer scrutiny makes it hard for 
people to stay away from social media.

Facebook is not an addiction. It’s just the most 
popular medium for social interaction — until the 
next big thing comes along.

Unlike Social Media, Cigarettes and 
Alcohol Have Physical Consequences

Facebook’s Tangible Effects on Brain 
Make it a Diagnosable Condition

Rather Than an Addiction, Checking 
Facebook Represents Social Media Age

It seems as if each youth generation lays claim 
to a zeitgeist drug — LSD in the ’70s, cocaine in the 
’80s, heroin in the ’90s — and now, Facebook in the 
2000s. Some find it absurd to compare social media 
to illicit drugs, but Facebook should be considered 
an addiction for its tangible effects on the brain.

According to a 2012 study from Statistic Brain, 
98 percent of 18 to 24-year-olds partake in social 
media websites —the 54 percent of those with 
Facebook can probably attest to the slight gratifi-
cation from seeing a red flag notification. This is 
due to activation of the brain’s dopamine reward 
system, states the Best Masters of Psychology 2012 
infographic. Chemically, the brain responds to 
Facebook’s live and interactive interface similar to 
how it responds to Schedule 1 controlled drugs like 
crack cocaine or methamphetamines — they all 
cause dopamine release to fuel dependence.

The public remains in denial about social 
media addiction, but healthcare experts do not. 
The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders releasing this year 
will, for the first time, include Internet Addiction 
Disorder as requiring “further study.” China, 
Taiwan and Korea already accept the diagnosis and 
label it a national health crisis. The growing con-
sensus of Internet Addiction Disorder’s legitimacy 
among psychological experts speaks to Facebook’s 
addictive capabilities.

Facebook’s virtual intangibility lures users into 
thinking it is innocuous, but look at heroin. Now 
classified as illegal with no medicinal qualities and 
high abuse potential, heroin was once marketed 
in late 19th to early 20th century as a harmless 
miracle cough syrup.

Labeling social media an “addiction” is another 
cop-out to justify people’s lack of self-control on 
the Internet. The Facebook phenomenon should 
not be considered worse than alcoholism and ciga-
rette addictions that actually have life-threatening 
physical consequences.

The United States Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention attributes about 80,000 deaths to 
excessive alcohol use each year in the United States. 
The 2010 U.S. Surgeon General’s report says that 
cigarette smoking is the number one cause of pre-
ventable death worldwide, with 443,000 individuals 
dying from smoking-related illnesses each year. 
There have been no recorded deaths directly linked 
to an addiction to Facebook. Also, although previ-
ously linked with depression, a July 2012 study 
published by the University of Wisconsin School of 
Medicine and Public Health states that there is no 
significant association between Facebook use and 
mental illness. At most, Facebook is a time-waster 
that does not warrant a comparison to a one of the 
biggest killers worldwide.

In a 2012 article in The New York Times, “Are 
We Addicted to Facebook? It’s Complicated,” psy-
chologist Larry D. Rosen says that Facebooking is 
a compulsion rather than an addiction. This means 
that while the desire to go on Facebook exists, it 
is also possible to fight the urge with almost no 
physical repercussions. Rosen also claims that this 
compulsion tends to affect those with a predisposi-
tion for obsessive tendencies. 

Facebook is just a website, while alcohol and 
cigarettes are real poisons. And while people may 
blame Facebook for having  “addictive qualities,” 
with enough self control, it’s an easy habit to break.

An increasing number of colleges have implemented plastic water bottle bans, but UCSD should not follow suit because this would take 
away a convenient product and fail to effectively address other ways to reduce plastic waste.

Dorner’s 
Quest: A  
Miserable 
Failure

BY   Bahar   moshtaghian  StafF Writer   Illustration   by  Jeffrey   lau

Driven by a desire to cleanse the Los Angeles police department of its corrup-
tion and racism, former policeman 
Christopher Dorner launched a 
violent crusade against his for-
mer coworkers and their families. 
Before committing suicide in a 
gun battle with the police this past 
week, he killed two law enforce-
ment officers, the son of the man 
who defended him against dis-
missal charges and the son’s fian-
cee. Although his complaints may 
have some legitimacy, his murders 
of innocent people are deplorable 
and fail to meaningfully address the 
prejudice within the LAPD.

Despite his actions, a disgusting 
amount of people rose up in support 
of Dorner’s quest. The Facebook 
page “We Support Christopher 
Jordan Dorner” has received over 
16,000 likes, and the page’s creator 
even compares Dorner to the found-
ing fathers for taking action against 
the “ruling class.” Yet none of this 
sympathy seems to extend to his 
victims’ families. It is sickening to 
see such widespread support for a 
man who wrote this to his targets, “I 
never had the opportunity to have a 
family of my own … [so] I am ter-
minating yours.”

None of this is to say that the 
LAPD is a racism-free or benign 
organization. From 1965 to 1992, 
the department was plagued with 
complaints of racism and brutal-
ity culminating in multiple race 
riots. A study commissioned by the 
ACLU in 2008 found that blacks 
were three times more likely to be 
stopped than whites or Latinos and 
five times more likely to be arrested 
by the LAPD. But Dorner’s method 
of redressing this racism only serves 
to solidify an “us versus them” men-
tality. And true reform can never 
come if critics praise a cop killer; the 
LAPD would never bother respond-
ing to the claims of such people.

Nonetheless, times have changed 
since 1992, and the LAPD is far 
more ethnically diverse. Due to the 
reforms of police Chief Bill Bratton, 
whites now make up less than a 
third of the force whereas in 1991 
during the Rodney King riots, they 
comprised almost two-thirds. Fifteen 
percent of the force is now black, 
41 percent is Hispanic, and Asians 
make up 8 percent. Increased diver-
sity shows a stronger commitment to 
equal treatment under the law. 

These reforms have proven fruit-
ful in changing the LAPD’s image, 
too. Fifty-five percent of blacks say 
the LAPD is doing a “good job,” 
compared to 66 percent of whites 
and 59 percent of Latinos, accord-
ing to a 2012 survey by the Center 
for the Study of Los Angeles. Sixty-
nine percent of all residents fur-
ther believe that the people of Los 
Angeles have made some or a lot 
of progress in improving race rela-
tions since 1992. It seems that racial 
tensions have significantly calmed 
since the ’90s and that the reforms 
have made all ethnic groups less 
hostile towards the police.

Yes, there is still a long way to 
go for the LAPD to completely 
eliminate racism and corruption 
from itself, but the progress that has 
been made was through nonviolent 
and official channels, not by the 
deranged tactics of a sociopath. 

The use and sale of water bottles has recently evolved into a hot-button issue, as the common beverage container is 
piling up in our landfills. As of last year, over 90 
universities and colleges have implemented bans 
or heavy restrictions on the sale of water bottles 
in an effort to reduce plastic consumption and 
waste. More and more universities, such as UC 
Santa Cruz, are currently pushing for bans. Two 
years ago, the Student Sustainability Collective 
at UCSD proposed a water bottle ban to reduce 
plastic consumption for our campus that ulti-
mately did not go through. While the intentions 
behind these bans are admirable, due to the fact 
that the production of 300 million tons of plastic 
per year is taking its toll on the environment, 
this is still not the right choice for UCSD. This 
type of ban is overly stringent because it takes 
away a consumer’s choice to purchase a useful 
product, and would not effectively address other 

ways that people could reduce waste.  
Although bans prevent the sale of water bot-

tles, they can’t stop individuals from acquiring 
them in other ways. The ban simply provides an 
inconvenient obstacle to consumers who want to 
purchase the product anyway. According to The 
Boston Globe, water bottle sales at a local con-
venience store rose 10 to 20 percent in Acton, 
Mass. after the neighboring town of Concord 
passed a ban on the sale of water bottles. 
Rather than adhere to the ban, many citizens 
of Concord traveled the extra 10 miles just to 
purchase their water bottles. A ban on campus 
would be ineffective as well, as students would 
simply have to go off campus to the nearest gro-
cery store to pick up a pack of water bottles.

Consumption of bottled water has increased 
over the past several years, so a ban on campuses 
with only several thousand inhabitants will 
have little tangible effect. According to National 

Geographic, in 2011, bottled water consumption 
grew to an all-time high of 9.1 billion gallons in 
the United States — even after 15 universities 
had already implemented a ban on bottled water. 
Considering the staggering amount of bottled 
water that is consumed by the U.S., a couple 
of bans across college campuses isn’t going to 
make a dent in the problem. It will take a con-
scious effort of all of society to make the types 
of changes that will bring about real progress in 
reducing plastic waste.

Yes, water bottles produce waste that’s det-
rimental to the environment, but the fact that 
water bottles are a both a huge convenience to 
people on the go and provide a healthy drinking 
option validates their use.  Many products, like 
cars, for example, come with their environmen-
tal consequences, but the need for convenient

transportation justifies their use as 
well.  Instead of banning the product 
altogether, it is better to make people 
aware of the effects of their choice to 
use water bottles and allow them to 
weigh the benefits of its use versus its 
consequences.

If universities want to make a 
social statement about the issue of 
plastic waste, they can raise public 
awareness through ad campaigns 
or other methods that don’t involve 
a complete ban. To employ a varia-
tion of the “give a man a fish, teach a 
man to fish” proverb, banning water 
bottles will not teach effective con-
servation policies — it would only 
address one aspect of this country’s 

issues with excess waste. On the 
other hand, educating the public 
about different types of environmen-
tal issues and how they can make a 
difference in their own everyday lives 
is the best way to give them an incen-
tive to change various aspects of their 
lifestyle to reduce waste. 

Currently, the Sustainability 
Resource Center at UCSD is doing 
just that with its “Own Your Impact” 
campaign. The SRC offers online 
pledges that suggest ideas that stu-
dents can take up in efforts to live 
more sustainable lifestyles in areas 
such as waste, energy, and transpor-
tation. Campaigns like these are the 
best way to get students informed 
and active about conservation. UCSD 
currently gives every incoming fresh-

man a reusable plastic water bottle 
and has implemented “hydration sta-
tions” around campus for students to 
refill their water bottles. Presenting 
optional rather than forced lifestyle 
changes grants students the freedom 
to choose the more environmentally 
responsible option.

Although the incentive behind 
banning plastic water bottles is com-
mendable, a ban is not a reasonable 
option. The goal should still be to 
reduce plastic waste, but it should be 
done in a way that involves educa-
tion of the public, while still allowing 
individuals to make their own per-
sonal choices.

Solve For X By Philip Jia LETTER  TO  THE  EdITOR

Dear editor,
Although the State of the Union 

speech was focused on the economy, 
the President defended the secretive 
CIA drone program, which targets 
suspected militants overseas, includ-
ing Americans.  He answered critics, 
largely from within his own party, 
who have complained about its secre-
cy and questioned its legality.  Drones 
can linger over a target, gather intel-
ligence by pulling in millions of tera-
bytes of data, and they can thereupon 
launch precisely targeted air strikes 
without putting a U.S. aircrew at risk. 

Yet the scene from “The 
Godfather,” which has Michael 
Corleone describing his mafia don 
father as “no different from other 
powerful man, any man who’s 
responsible for other people, like a 
senator or a president” might cause 
some second thoughts. Americans 
would like to believe that an execu-
tion ordered by our president is 
very different from one ordered by 
a mafia don.

The size of San Diego’s 
unmanned aerial vehicle industry 
doubled over the past five years and 
could double again as Unmanned 
Aerial Vehicles are increasingly used 
for monitoring U.S. borders and 
domestic airspace. Defense giant 
Northrop Grumman of Rancho 
Bernardo specializes in Global Hawk 
UAVs. General Atomics Aeronautical 
Systems of Poway is best known for 
manufacturing Predator UAVs.

If the Pentagon does slow the 
huge building and deployment pro-
gram, it won’t affect the CIA drone 
strikes in Afghanistan, Pakistan, 
Yemen and elsewhere against ter-
ror suspects. General Mike Hostage, 
commander of Air Combat 
Command, said senior leaders are 

analyzing the military’s drone needs 
and discussions are beginning. But 
he said the current number patrol-
ling the skies overseas may be 
enough. Overall, Pentagon spending 
on unmanned aircraft has jumped 
from $284 million in 2000 to nearly 
$4 billion in the past fiscal year. 
The growth in investment by the 
Pentagon has made UAVs the largest 
single category in San Diego County’s 
defense contractor sector.

Congress approved legislation 
that requires the Federal Aviation 
Administration to have a plan to inte-
grate drones of all kinds into national 
airspace on a wide scale by 2015. 
UAVs will soon be used much more 
extensively by law enforcement and 
other federal, state and local agencies.

UCSD’s Chancellor, Dr. Pradeep 
Khosla, has served as adviser to the 
Aeronautics Committee of NASA, 
on the Strategy Review Board of the 
Ministry of Science and Technology 
of the government of Chinese-Taipei 
and as Senior Advisory Group for the 
Defense Advanced Research Projects 
Agency on Joint Unmanned Combat 
Air Systems. The 183,000-square-foot 
Structural and Materials Engineering 
Building “is the future of the uni-
versity,” Dr. Khosla has said. SME 
also drew high marks from Linden 
Blue, co-owner of General Atomics 
Aeronautical Systems.

UCSD has been involved in UAV 
research for more than a decade, 
working on such areas as the struc-
tural integrity of drones, better 
propulsion systems and ways to fly 
them in coordinated packs. “Our 
challenge in San Diego is access to 
FAA-approved airspace for flight test-
ing autonomous UAVs,” said John 
Kosmatka, aerospace and structural 
engineering professor at the Jacobs 
School of Engineering.

According to an influential new study administered by the Higher Education 
Research Institute at UCLA, college 
freshmen, faced with grim econom-
ic prospects, are studying harder 
than ever so they can get jobs. 

Nearly 90 percent of entering 
freshmen at 283 colleges across the 
U.S., including UCSD, said that get-
ting a job was a “very important” 
reason to attend college in 2012 — 
an all-time high. It was also a turn-
ing point: 2012 was the first year 
that students placed career pros-
pects above gaining a “general edu-
cation and appreciation for ideas.”

Freshmen are asking more ques-
tions, learning more from their 
mistakes and evaluating more 
sources of information than ever 
have before — all key predictors of 
academic success, according to the 
educators at CIRP. However, the 
flip side is that more entering fresh-
men are feeling overwhelmed by the 
prospect of college as well.

Freshman Hussain Jaffri is study-
ing physiology and neuroscience at 
UCSD. He said that his experience 
in college so far has been consistent 
with the major results of the survey.

“A lot of my older cousins went 
to college here, and the way they’ve 
described the campus is very dif-
ferent from the way it seems to me 
now,” he said. “It’s not all about par-
tying anymore.”

Jaffri said that he is more anx-
ious about his career than his cous-
ins were at his age. He said this is 
because the structure of the job 
market has changed.

“In the past, you could go to col-
lege and have that be enough to get

For decades, the consensus in the scientific community has been that animals and plants 
split into different kingdoms over 1.3 
billion years ago. So it makes sense 
that new research suggesting that 
plants and animals share a critical, 
previously uncharacterized enzyme 
called VAS1 is causing a bit of a stir. 

Joanne Chory, a professor at the 
Salk Institute, has found that levels 
of two of the most important hor-
mones that regulate growth in plants 
— auxin and ethylene — are finely 
regulated by VAS1. Auxin promotes 
growth, and ethylene (best known 
for ripening bananas) promotes aging 
and death. In living plants, the ratio 
of auxin to ethylene is determined 
by how much light a plant is getting. 

More light means more auxin, which 
means more growth — scientists have 
known this for decades. Put a plant in 
shade, and ethylene takes over, put-
ting the brakes on growth.

What scientists didn’t fully under-
stand, however, was how levels of 
these two hormones are regulated in 
plants. They had identified a pathway 
before, but it was slow and clunky, 
involving lots of enzymes and inter-
mediate steps. If plants used that path-
way alone, it would take them days to 
adjust to changing light conditions. 
This failure to adapt isn’t observed in 
nature — otherwise plants would be 
dying left and right. 

Thus, many scientists have sus-
pected that there had to be another, 
nimbler mechanism for modulating 
levels of ethylene and auxin. They 
were in the minority, however, until 
this month. That’s when it all changed.

“When we first tried publishing 
this paper based on this discovery, 
people in the scientific community 
were saying, ‘Well, we don’t under-
stand why you need that enzyme,’” 
Chory said with a laugh.

This is where the VAS1 enzyme 
comes into play: VAS1 provides a 
shortcut to the slow and clunky path-
way. In plants, this means quicker 
regulation of auxin and ethylene lev-
els, which means a better adaptation 
to changing light conditions. 

Interestingly, Chory found that 
this key regulator of plant growth, 
VAS1, has a close human analogue 
that had already been identified. It’s 
been implicated in several diseases 
that affect hundreds of millions of 
patients around the world — diabetes 
and arthritis are two of the biggest. 
Chory said she hopes that by bet-
ter characterizing this pathway, the 

mechanisms underlying diseases like 
diabetes and arthritis can be better 
understood by researchers.

Chory collaborated with Joseph 
Noel, a chemist at the Salk Institute 
and director at the Skirball Center for 
Chemical Biology and Proteomics, 
so that she and the post-doctorates, 
working under her, Yongxia Guo and 
Zuyu Zheng, have a better under-
standing of the chemical reactions 
taking place in the mustard plants.

“Joe and his team make work-
ing on enzymes more fun,” Chory 
said. “In fact, it’s a nice give and take 
between the two labs, because we have 
a common interest, but we’re looking 
at different parts of the research.”

According to Chory, upon the dis-
covery of the VAS1 enzyme, Noel suf-
fered a few sleepless nights in order to 
form a sensible hypothesis.

Chory explained that this discov-

ery of the VAS1 enzyme is truly a 
single chapter in the long history of 
studying plant growth and its relation-
ship to human beings. 

“In 20 years, we have learned how 
a plant adapts to shade, how one 
important hormone got made and 
identified an enzyme that people 
didn’t even know existed,” Chory said.

Moreover, Chory said that her 
experience with skeptics in the scien-
tific community have taught her the 
value of thinking outside the box. 

“Part of our message is to stay 
open-minded about what the mecha-
nisms are going to be that link this 
small molecule to another small mol-
ecule,” Chory said. “It’s to keep your 
eyes open.”

It would have been easy to miss Bob Perelman — a distinguished American poet — at the campus-
wide New Writing Series workshop 
last Wednesday. Looking subdued in 
his beige shirt and faded jeans, he sat 
patiently among the audience until it 
was his turn to speak.

He opened with a quote from his 
poem, an intensely political work 
about the former vice president.  

“We may not have chosen to live 
inside Dick Cheney’s mind, but we 
do,” he read aloud. “Wyoming, I 
read somewhere, is the safest place 
to live in North America./ No torna-
dos, no tsunamis, no earthquakes, 
no hurricanes, monsoons, cyclones, 
or floods. No major airport: No big 
planes crashing in the sleet. Not 
even much traffic: Not too many car 
crashes./ But if living in Wyoming is 
so safe, living inside Dick Cheney’s 
mind, though it was formed in 
Wyoming and stood for Wyoming 
in the Senate, is not safe at all.”

Perelman’s work is flourished 
with this sort of political nuance. 
The poem begins with the political 
figure Dick Cheney before continu-
ing into deeper historical, govern-
mental and political waters. 

The New Writing Series was found-
ed in 2007 by the Division of Arts and 
Humanities. It is an initiative that aims 
to enrich the UCSD art community by 
inviting guest poets and writers to read 
their works.

Perelman’s invitation to participate 
in the New Writing Series overlapped 
with the archiving of his poetry in the 
Archive for New Poetry — a branch 

Passions and Politics: A Portrait of  a Contemporary Poet 
BY  Mozelle  Arm ijo  Staff writer

The decorated poet Bob Perelman came to UCSD last week as a featured speaker for The New Writing Series. 
He shared his views on the “Language” school of poetry, contemporary politics and happiness.

of the Mandeville Special Collections 
Library that houses an extensive col-
lection of manuscripts, sound record-
ings and poems by American poets. 
The archive, founded in 1968, high-
lights alternative approaches to writing 
that have developed since 1945.

Perelman, who has visited San 
Diego several times before, all for 
art-related purposes, currently lives 
in Pennsylvania, where he teaches 
courses on modernist and contem-
porary poetry at the University of 
Pennsylvania. 

Perelman grew up in Youngstown, 
Ohio. He attended the University of 
Michigan and later the University of 
Rochester, where he earned a Master’s 
degree in Greek and Latin classics. 
His career in poetry began in 1969, 
when he attended the University of 
Iowa to take part in the Iowa Writers’ 
Workshop. He earned a Master of 
Fine Arts degree in creative writing 
there. After completing the Writers’ 
Workshop, he took up residence in 
Hills, Iowa, where he became the edi-

tor of Hills magazine.
In 1976, Perelman and his wife, 

Francie Shaw, left Iowa for San 
Francisco. He then founded the San 
Francisco talk series in 1977, which 
allowed writers to discuss the poetics 
and politics involved in language. That 
same year, Perelman extended the talk 
series across the pond while studying 
abroad at King’s College London.

After the establishment of the 
talk series, Perelman taught part 
time but soon decided to pursue a 
career in academia. He earned his 
Ph.D. at UC Berkeley. 

Throughout his career, Perelman 
has published 16 books of poetry. 
His best-known collections of poet-
ry include “IFLIFE” (2006), “Ten to 
One: Selected Poems” (1999) and 
“Primer” (1981).

Perelman is associated with the 
“Language” school of poetry — poet-
ry that riffs on the interplay of sound 
and meaning. But he said that he 
didn’t agree with the characterization. 

“The style of my poetry is inno-
vative, I would say,” Perelman said. 
“I don’t tell stories in my poetry. 

But some parts would seem to be 
unusual uses of language.”

In addition to writing poetry, 
Perelman has allocated time to 
being a poetry critic. 

Two of his major books of 
poetry criticism include “The 
Marginalization of Poetry” (1996) and 
“The Trouble with Genius” (1994).

While Perelman steered clear of 
his books of critique at the New 
Writing Series, he did share poetry 
from his popular works — mostly 
from “Primer” and “IFLIFE” — but 
also poems from the still-untitled 
book he is currently working on. 

Although many of his poems are 
laced with political, Perelman said 
he didn’t have an agenda.

 “I am not writing poetry for a 
single political purpose or anything 
like that,” Perelman said. “I have all 
sorts of political desires, but they 
don’t go directly into the poetry.” 

When Perelman puts pen to 
paper, he hopes that his words 
achieve a greater purpose.

“I can’t boil out a single message 
about my poetry,” Perelman said. “I 

don’t have one unified cause. I am, I 
suppose, writing poetry to improve 
the quality of life in a very indirect 
way. Hopefully, it makes people’s 
minds a little bit livelier and hap-
pier.”

Perelman read for nearly an 
hour, shifting his feet from side to 
side and speaking intently into the 
microphone. At times, he managed 
to elicit laughter from his audience 
due to the occasional curse word in 
his poems.

The mood of the Visual Arts 
Space shifted when Perelman shared 
a solemn piece entitled “For Emma.”

The seven-stanza poem was 
written to honor and remember the 
life of the late Emma Bernstein, 
daughter of fellow poet and close 
friend Charles Bernstein. 

“Maybe that’s why/ we invented 
the present/ as a place to live, to 
keep the things we do know/ know 
so exactly, keep them exactly, keep/ 
all of them, keep what we know/ 
near, at hand, alive in our minds:/ 
Emma.”

At the conclusion of his read-

ing, Perelman took questions from 
the audience. One such question 
was, “What is your favorite poem?” 
Perelman leaned back and let out 
a loud “Hah!” The question had 
caught him by surprise.  

“I don’t know,” Perelman said. 
“I can’t answer that. I usually like 
things about 90 percent of the way 
through. Sometimes poems I really 
like, I really don’t like at all. It’s a 
little bit like, ‘Oh, I can’t stand this. 
I can’t stand this … oh, I am in love. 
This is a great poem.’”

Although Perelman has been 
writing for over 40 years, he said 
poetry remains a thrilling career for 
him. He cited the number of books 
of poetry he has authored as evi-
dence that poetry has never lost its 
thrill for him, in spite of the years. 

“I write poetry because I find it 
exciting,” Perelman said. “I am very 
happy doing it. It is part of an ongo-
ing enterprise and a much larger 
enterprise — human culture.”

a good job. But that’s just not the 
case anymore,” he said. “I think the 
knowledge that this isn’t the end, in 
terms of taking notes and going to 
lectures, has helped me focus more 
on my work. I’m confident that if 
I study hard and work at it, I’ll be 
able to support my family someday. 
That’s why I’m here.”

Freshman Timothy Choi said 
he was concerned by the freshman 
survey’s results. He is a computer 
science major and a graduate of the 
Ruth Asawa School of the Arts in 
San Francisco.

“I dream of doing all kinds of 

art when I grow up, but I know I’m 
going to do computer science.”

Choi said he chose the major 
because it seemed more practical 
than painting or graphic design. He 
said he would probably feel more 
comfortable becoming an artist if 
the economy was less rough.

“Art is what I know. I don’t know 
how passionate I am about comput-
er science. I haven’t done it long.”

Choi is open to pursuing a 
career in graphic design, which 
would combine his training with 
his dream. But he said that even 
that would be difficult and a com-
promise at best. The only thing for 
now, he said, was to give it time.

“I think I will come to like it 
someday, but right now I do feel 
overwhelmed by the work,” he said.

Money was a significant factor 
in Choi’s decision to come to UCSD. 
However, he said the school is still 
an immense financial burden on his 
family. He said that the high price 
of college has made him a more 
competitive student, even though 
his parents can afford the continu-
ally increasing cost of attendance 
at a UC. 

“Thinking about the cost, it makes 
me more depressed if I do badly.”

SCIENCES BUILDING (SSB), ROOM 107 
IICAS - The Institute for International, Comparative and 
Area Studies presents Dr. Madiha Afzal, Assistant 
Professor of International Development, University of 
Maryland School of Public Policy. Dr. Afzal uses 2009 
public opinion survey data from Pakistan to show that

militant groups, whereas uneducated women are more 
likely to support militant groups relative to uneducated 
men.

On the men’s side, senior Julius 
Espiritu, Korth, Stassi and McCallum 
raced together to win the 200-yard 
medley relay with a time of 1:29.48. 
Espiritu, Korth, senior Adam Yen and 
junior Alex Merrill also finished first 
in the 400-yard medley relay with 
a time of 3:17.20. The Triton men’s 
group of sophomore Jack Galvan, 
freshman Ethan Pham, Espiritu and 
Merrill took second in the 200-yard 
freestyle relay with a time of 1:22.70. 

Galvin, McCallum, Stassi and 
Espiritu also finished the 400-yard 
freestyle relay in second, with a time 
of 3:02. Both the men and women 
Tritons took home first in the 800-
yard freestyle relay, with the team 
of Rice, freshman Michael Leung, Li 
and Merrill finishing at 6:37.67, and 
sophomore Sierra Robbins, Dong, 
Watkins and Shakya took first as a 
group with a time of 7:26.45 for the 
women.

In the 200-yard freestyle relay, the 
UCSD group of Fountain, Tse, fresh-
man Colleen Daley, and Robbins fin-
ished first with a time of 1:33.65. 
Robbins, Tse, senior Amber Tan and 
Daley also finished second as a group 
in the 400-yard freestyle relay with 
a time of 3:27.79. The Tritons also 
took second in the 400-yard medley 
relay with junior Sandy Hon, Chen, 

Dong and Shakya racing to finish in 
3:49.07.

“The relays were definitely all very 
exciting,” Macedo said. “That’s the 
best way to get your athletes to the 
NCAAs. When you qualify in a relay, 
it gets four athletes to the meet. So a 
lot of those relays really meant a lot to 
us, and a lot of them came very close, 
especially on the men’s side.” At the 
PCSC, the UCSD diving team also 
fared favorably. UCSD diving coach 
Michelle Casillas was named Female 
Dive Coach of the Year.

Senior Tyler Runsten placed first 
in the one-meter dive (313.30) and 
the three-meter dive (339.30), with 
junior Luke Calkins taking second 
with a score of 288.45. Freshman 
Allyson Cohen placed third in the 
women’s three-meter dive with 
211.80 points.

The Tritons look forward to com-
peting in the 2013 NCAA Division-II 
Championships in Birmingham, Ala. 
March 6 to March 9.

“On the men’s side, [the NCAAs 
are] going to be a dogfight — it’s not 
going to be easy. We were seventh my 
first two years here, and then the last 
two years, we got second, so there is 
a lot of expectation for us,” Macedo 
said.

conference play. UCSD remained in 
seventh place in the conference stand-
ings.
UCSD vs. Chico State, Feb. 16

The Tritons did not have much 
time to dwell on their loss to Cal State 
Stanislaus, however, as they played the 
next night against Chico State.

The Tritons’ game at Chico in Acker 
Gymnasium was their last road game 
of the season. UCSD fell to Chico State 
64–61 in a heartbreaking fashion, as 
the potential game-tying three-pointer 
by McCann was disallowed when the 
officials ruled that the shot failed to 
leave his hands before the buzzer.

The Tritons were led by freshman 
forward Drew Dyer, who recorded a 
double-double with 17 points and 10 
rebounds in 25 minutes of game play. 
McCann led the Tritons with six assists 
and also scored 16 points. Chico State 
featured a balanced offense, with four 
players each scoring over 10 points.

In the opening half, both teams 

struggled from the field. UCSD shot 
31.4 percent on 11-for-35 and went 
1-for-8 behind the arc, while Chico 
State went 9-for-25.  The score was 
close throughout the first half, with 
the largest lead held by the Tritons at 5.

At the start of the second half, 
back-to-back three-pointers by Chico’s 
Damario Sims gave the Wildcats an 
8-point lead early on. A Triton 7–1 run 
highlighted by a pair of three-pointers 
and a jumper got the Tritons right back 
into the game, and the score stayed 
close for the remainder of the half.

In the final five minutes of play, 
both teams exchanged leads, and the 
game was tied on four separate occa-
sions. The Wildcats’ Park buried a 
three-pointer with 42 seconds left on 
the clock to give Chico a slight 61–58 
advantage. After a 20-second timeout, 
McCann hit a three-pointer to tie the 
game with 26 seconds left.

The Wildcats were left with pre-
sumably the last shot of the game, and 
with three seconds left in regulation, 
Sims sunk the eventual game-win-

ning three-pointer to give Chico the 
64–61 lead. Without much time left, 
McCann tossed up a shot from three-
quarters down the court, which fell. 
Unfortunately, the officials reviewed 
the shot and concluded that the ball 
did not leave his hands in time.

With two road losses, the Tritons 
return home in hopes of changing 
their fortune against Cal State East Bay 
on Friday, Feb. 22. The game begins 
at 7:30 p.m., and will be broadcast on 
ESPN 1700. The Tritons have four 
games remaining in their regular sea-
son schedule. All four will be played 
at home.

“Our focus hasn’t changed. We are 
really excited about these four home 
games and to close out the season. We 
feel we can win all four, we are really 
confident, and going into the playoffs 
with some momentum would be nice,” 
McGrath said.

Amidst Three-Game Skid Tritons Return Home This WeekendUCSD Swim Impresses at the Pacific 
Collegiate Swim Conference

UCSD vs. UC Irvine
The Tritons hosted the No. 

1-ranked UC Irvine Anteaters on 
Saturday, Feb. 16 confident from 
their win against UCSB the night 
before. But the road to victory 
proved much more challenging 
against the Anteaters after a straight 
set loss on Saturday night.

Starting off against UCI, the 
teams played shot for shot with kills 
from Stahl, Iorfino and Hayes, until 
Irvine turned the tide to jump to 
19–13 and solidified a first set win 
25–16. 

In the second, the teams remained 
close in scoring, tying almost every 
point until the Gauchos grabbed a 
break at 21–17 and took a 25–19 win 

shortly thereafter. 
In the third frame, UCSD went 

down early in the set before rally-
ing to a 16–16 tie with scores from 
Hayes, senior Greg Smith and junior 
Vaun Lennon. The Tritons took their 
first lead of the game at 19–18, but 
the Gauchos’ offense came back to 
win 4 of the next 5 points, and 
ended the game and the match with 
a 25–21 win in the third.

Though the team recorded a loss, 
Tritons still slated some impres-
sive statistics with 35 kills and 16 
digs, while Irvine had 41 kills and 
the same 16 digs. Triton leaders for 
Saturday night included Hayes with 
14 kills and Eberts with nine.

When looking at the team’s con-
ference and the differences between 

winning and losing a match, head 
coach Kevin Ring concedes that it 
all comes down to a few possessions 
at the net.

“We’re not that far off, we’ve had 
some close games, but it’s really big, 
the mental aspect of it, can you play 
tough down the stretch and can 
you come from behind?” Ring said. 
“We’ve challenged some experienced 
players saying this is what we need 
you to do this entire set or this entire 
game.”

No. 1 UCI will meet with UCSD

The UCSD men’s volleyball team 
beat Division-I UC Santa Barbara 
in straight sets last Friday, Feb. 15 at 
RIMAC Arena, dominating from start 
to finish (25–20, 25–17, 25–20). On 
Saturday night, Feb. 16, the Tritons 
fell to No. 1 team UC Irvine 0–3 
(25–16, 25–19, 25–21). Sophomore 
outside hitter Nick Iorfino, tallying 
his 130th kill, led the team in the 
attack on Friday night with 12 kills 
for the night. The win brought the 
Tritons to 5–10 overall and 3–8 in the 
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation. 
The Tritons met with the Gauchos 
earlier in the season, falling on Feb. 1.

UCSD vs. UC Santa Barbara
The Tritons started the first 

set with even scoring against the 
Gauchos before they pulled ahead 
to 20–15, and eventually won the set 
25–20. The Tritons dominated the 
second set, taking a quick 3–0 lead 
after a kill by sophomore Cheyne 
Hayes and a service ace from junior 
Mike Brunsting. The team’s asser-
tive offense led to a commanding 
11–4 lead, with kills from senior 
Carl Eberts, Iorfino and Hayes. The 

Tritons continued to hold the lead 
with a second set score of 25–17, 
never letting the Gauchos score more 
than two consecutive points at a time. 
The third set started with a tied score 
at 3–3 until the Tritons exploited the 
Gauchos’ ineffective serving as well 
as an ace from junior Fred Stahl and 
another kill from Hayes. At a 9–6 
score, the team went on a 4-point run 
to bring the score to 13–6, cementing 
a strong lead and ultimately a victory 
over UCSB 25–20.  

Overall, UCSD out-hit the 
Gauchos .376–.202 for the night, and 
finished with 35 digs and 45 kills, 
while UCSB had just 22 digs and 29 
kills. Scoring leaders included Iorfino 
with 12 kills, Eberts with 11 and 
Hayes with nine.  Senior libero Chase 
Frishman had a match high of 13 digs 
against the Gauchos as well.

“I liked our effort in different 
phases of the game, attacking, serve 
receive attacking, transition, block-
ing well, serving tough,” UCSD head 
coach Kevin Ring told the UCSD 
Athletics Department.  “I thought we 
played a lot of the phases of the game 
pretty well.”

UCSD  vs.  CSU  Stanislaus,  Feb.  15
Trying to avoid back-to-back loss-

es, UCSD took on Cal State Stanislaus 
Friday, Feb. 15 in Turlock at the 
Fitzpatrick Arena. 

“They made over [50 percent] of 
their threes,” senior Tyler McGrath 
said. “It’s hard to win against anybody 
when teams are that hot.”

The Tritons were unable to recover 
from a barrage of second-half three-
pointers and fell for the second straight 
time to the Warriors, 57–72.

UCSD shot a combined 24-for-53 
from the field for a solid 45.3 per-
cent but allowed Cal State Stanislaus 
to shoot 53.1 percent on 26-for-49, 
including a blistering 52.2 percent from 
the three-point line. UCSD outscored 
the Warriors 36 to 16 in the paint but 
made nine fewer three-pointers. 

Senior forward Justin Brue had a 
game-high 18 points, going 9-for-11 
from the field to go along with a steal. 
Junior point guard James McCann 
played an all-around good game, con-
tributing 12 points and also posting 
six assists and five rebounds. Taylor 
Bell led the way for the Warriors with 
16 points, and Nick Hodge added 13 

points with eight rebounds and two 
blocks.

The first half of play was close 
throughout, featuring five lead chang-
es. The Tritons shot 10-for-24, while 
The Warriors shot 11-for-27. UCSD 
jumped out to an early 6-point lead in 
the first eight minutes of play, leading 
11–5 with 13 minutes to play in the 
half. But Stanislaus went on a tear from 
there, posting a 16–2 run to break 
ahead 21–13 with eight minutes and 25 
seconds remaining. The Tritons fought 
to stay in the game, and the half ended 
29–24 with the Warriors on top. 

In the second half, both teams 
came out trading baskets until the 
Tritons used an 11–3 run to regain the 
lead 40–39 with 12 minutes left to play. 
With five minutes left in regulation, 
the score was still close with Stanislaus 
leading by three, 54–51. But within 
the next three minutes, the Warriors 
used a 10–0 run to balloon the lead to 
13 with two minutes to play, and the 
Tritons were unable to reduce the lead 
any further. The Tritons fell, outscored 
43–33 in the second half. 

 With the loss, the Tritons drop to 
9–11 on the season and 8–9 in CCAA

The four-day, 20-event-long Pacific Collegiate Swim Conference Championships concluded on Saturday, Feb. 16. The No. 4-ranked UCSD men 
finished with an overall score of 1543.5, well ahead of 
California Baptist University (1357.5) and Fresno Pacific 
University (1108). Similarly, the No. 3 Triton women 
finished with 1364.5 points, in front of Cal State East 
Bay (954), Simon Fraser University (886) and 10 other 
schools to win their fifth straight league crown.

The UCSD men and women both took first in the 
1650-meter swim event. Junior transfer Erika Rodman 
took first in the 1650-meter freestyle with a time of 
17:10.69, and senior Jeremy Smith touched first for the 
men at 15:39.26. 

Junior co-captain Anji Shakya took first in the 200-
meter freestyle (1:48.24) and 500-yard freestyle early in 
the competition, before she won the 200-yard backstroke 
(2:01.35) and was named the tournament MVP.

The Triton women took a 1-2-3 sweep in the 500-
yard freestyle, with Shakya touching first at 4:48.19 and 
senior Beth Dong following her with a time of 4:59.81. 
Rodman finished third with a time of 5:00.63, while 
Shakya’s win broke a 20-year-old record in the 500-yard 

freestyle.
“To be breaking a record from 1993 for a non-schol-

arship Division-II program — that’s incredible,” UCSD 
head coach Matt Macedo said.

The men followed suit by sweeping their 500-yard 
freestyle with Smith finishing first in 4:28.30, freshman 
Chin Hao Chang touching second at 4:30.83, followed by 
freshman Paul Li at 4:31.26.

Senior Olivia Fountain took first in the 50-yard 
freestyle with a time of 23.51, followed by fellow senior 
Katherine Tse (23.60). In the men’s 50-yard freestyle, the 
Tritons went 2–3, with juniors Nick Korth finishing at 
20.60 and Reid McCallum taking third (20.63).

Freshman Rosa Bebi (2:20.04), senior Casey Adams 
(2:20.48) and sophomore Eva Chen (2:20.92) also went 
2-4-5 in the 200-yard breaststroke.

In the men’s 100-yard butterfly, senior Adam Yen 
took first with a time of 49.09, followed by sophomore 
teammate Dane Stassi in third with a time of 49.54.

Freshman Naomi Thomas won her first individual 
conference title in the 200-yard butterfly with a time of 
2:01.53, with freshman Dari Watkins following her in 
third (2:04.23). Thomas also finished second in the 100-

yard butterfly with a time of 56.02.
Korth defended his back-to-back titles in the 200-

yard breaststroke with a first-place finish of 1:57.49, fall-
ing just .02 seconds short of besting his own meet record 
of 1:57.47 from last year’s PCSC.

“We’ve got a lot of history in that we’re going on many 
years of being conference champions,” Macedo said.

Stassi followed Korth by winning the 200-yard but-
terfly with a meet record of 1:47.22, just ahead of senior 
teammate Adam Rice in 1:50.63, with Yen completing a 
1-2-3 Triton sweep in 1:51.36.

Stassi’s time also lowered the 1:47.53 set by former 
UCSD standout Kurt Boehm in 2005.

Rice’s sweep of individual medley events early in the 
week earned him MVP honors. Rice took first in the 
200-yard individual medley (1:50.24) as well as in the 
400-yard IM (3:57.67) to earn his way to the NCAAs. 
Fellow teammate and freshman Kyle Nadler finished in 
third with a time of 4:01.08. 

Coach Macedo noted the increasing strength of the 
conference with challenges in taking first in the relays.
