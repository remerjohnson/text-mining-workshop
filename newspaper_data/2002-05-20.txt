Undergrad 
research 
presented 
90 students show 
off their findings 
By BRIAN LAUTER 
Contributing Writer 

More than 90 UCSD undergrad-
uates presented research papers 
Saturday at the 15th annual UCSD 
Undergraduate Research 
Conference, held at the Faculty 
Club. 

Students were organized into 17 
roundtable discussions for the pre-
sentations, each presided over by a 
faculty member. The roundtables, 
with topics ranging from chemistry 
to political science, included student 
presentations followed by group dis-
cussions in which visitors were 
encouraged to participate. 

Conference organizers said that 
the UCSD Undergraduate Research 
Conference as a whole was an 
opportunity to celebrate undergrad-
uates at UCSD. 

"So many of the things here at 
UCSD regarding research are from 
graduate students - or faculty, of 
course," said coordinator Darlene 
Salmon. "But this day is all about 
undergraduate students doing 
research and also the student life 
here at UCSD." 

The roundtable, presided over 
by sociology professor Leon 
Zamosc, centered on presentations 
regarding issues relevant to college 
students. 

"Every year we learn more about 
student life, culture, student values, 
the problems of the students and 
about particular sectors of students," 
Zamosc said. 

This year, "Drinking, Driving 
and Peer Interventions," presented 
by Sara Andrews of Eleanor 
Roosevelt College, explored gender 
differences in peer drunken driving 
intervention among college-age stu-
dents. 

Through a series of interviews 
and participant observation, 
Andrews concluded that men were 
more apt to use physical restraint to 
prevent drunken driving, while 
women felt less comfortable being as 
forceful. Instead, Andrews said 
women used psychological tactics 
more often, and as a whole were less 
likely to physically intervene than 
men. 

Andrews also found that when

Sun God lights and livens up UCSD

Got sunscreen?: An unidentified student reaffirms the craziness the Sun God 
festival offers by sprinting naked through the Price Center at Friday's festivities. 

Students drawn 
to day's festivities 
By KIRSTEN HUBBARD 
Staff Vtt\iter 

UCSD exploded with acoVlty, 
music and people during the day-
time festivities of the annual Sun 
God festival on Friday. 

Both Library Walk and the Sun 
God lawn were dotted with dozens 
of booths, featuring food, music and 
games, each sponsored by a student 
organization. 

"I'm so happy that Sun God's 
here. Finally people come out of 
their rooms and actually walk 
around and have fun," said Revelle 
College senior and SaiJing Club 
member RJ. Ward. 

Huge inflatable attractions such 
as a boxing ring and a colorful obsta-
cle course were sprawled across Sun 
God lawn. 

Students ate cotton candy, sang 
karaoke and enjoyed freebies from 
various groups. 

"I love that Sun God is all 
about the students," said Alissa 
Nadel, a Muir sophomore, who 
wore yellow daisies in her hair as 
she watched musical perfor-
mances in the Price Center. "It's a 
day where everyone feels com-
fortable on campus. Everyone's 

feltlns

out and everyone's friendly." 
Many students used Sun God as 

an opportunity to go all-out, activi-
ty-wise and attire-wise. 

One male student could be found 
floating in the Price Center foun-
tain, wearing only a red Speedo and 
a bright pink inner tube. Two other 
male students jogged through the 
Price Center at noon wearing noth-
ing at all. 

Trevor Walker-Bennett, dressed 
in medieval apparel, stood at the 
Society for Creative Anachronisms 
booth on Sun God lawn, while other 
club members participated in fenc-
ing matches behind him. 

"Sun God is usually the best 
time for us to get out and show 
everyone what we're all about," 
said Walker-Bennett, a Roosevelt 
sophomore. "We demo and show 
off, getting everyone interested in 
our society." 

In addition, Sun God represent-
ed the chance to party for many stu-
dents, who congregated in residence 
halls and apartments to socialize. 
Round Table and Porters Pub were 
popular gathering places for stu-
dents over 21. 

The Price Center was also 
filled with celebrating students. A 
stage assembled in the middle fea-
tured musical presentations from 
groups such as the Hawaii Club

Thousands 
attend concert 
By JESSICA KRUSKAMP 
Senior Staff Writer 

Sun God featured tastes for 
everyone, with punk, hip-hop 
and eclectic rock flavors com-
plemented by resounding bass 
from the club tent at RIMAC 
field Friday night. 

An estimated 12,000 people 
attended the annual concert, 
said co-co/)rdinator Brandon 
Freeman. 

"Attendance was really 
good," Freeman said. "It was 
one of the largest eVf!r." 

Some of the musical smor-
gasbord's flavors, however, 
went sour during tne night as 
Knoc Turn'al's set ended early 
due to equipment failure. 

The newly ellpanded DJ 
tent remained largely full until 
Cake took the stage. 

Cake, the night's headliner, 
was welcomed by cheers and 
started by playing an instru-
mental opener without lights. 

Cake's brand of country 
twang and alternative rock was 
showcased in a set that 
spanned their early music and 
mainstream hits. 

At one point, lead singer 
John McCrea taunted the 
crowd that Cake would only 
play country songs. This was 
met by disapproval, so they 

just played a string of their 
biggest hi ts. 

Cake received the hea rt iest 
reaction from rad io hits such 
as "Never T here ," "T he 
Distance" and their encore 
cover song, "I Will urvivc ." 

Battle of the Ba nds wi nner 
Fivecrown opened the night. 
T heir hard bassline, enthusias-
tic stage presence and upbeat 
guitar riffs triggered several in 
the audience to dance and even 
cartwheel to the music. 

"They were good, but most 
people did not really get into it 
and do much to th e music," 
said Justin Kennedy, an 
Eleanor Roosevelt College 
freshman. 

As the night progressed, 
No Use for a Name delivered a 
profaniry-laden punk set 
despite a whimsical disco ball 
and laser show rotating above 
their heads. 

During equipment changes, 
masters of ceremonies K.c. 
Raymond , a Roosevelt sopho-
more, and Bianca Daly, a 
Marshall, sophomore prepped 
the audience for Knoc Turn'al 
rhymes. They had the relent-
less beat of the club tent -
which did not stop during any 
artist - as backup music. 

"It's cool that Knoc Turn'al 
is here because I am really into 
that music rather than the 
other lcind ... that is what I'm 
waiting to hear," said Phil

UCSD's 
biking 
commuters 
saluted 
Event part of 
local Bike to 
Work day 
By LAUREN RAU 
Contributing Writer 

By 6 a.m. on Friday, an eager 
group of volumeers from Rideshare 
Operations was ready to help, feed 
and champion the cause of the bicy-
cle commuters of the UCSD com-
munity. 

"It started out as more of an envi-
ronmental issue," said Rideshare 
Operations Manager Linda Griffin. 
"It's come to be a thank you to the 
people who bike ro work." 

This "thank you" included free 
breakfast, raffle prizes, a number of 
T-shirts, a bike aid station and the 
musical emertainment of radio sta-
tion 103.7 The Planet, a pit stop 
sponsor. Several people earned 
instant-win prizes within seconds of 
arriving at the pit srop. 

Traffic congestion is a problem in 
San Diego, said Tom Miller, the pro-
motions coordinator for the San 
Diego radio station. "So, anything 
we can do to help alleviate that, 
we're happy to do." 

The radio station was only one of 
several supporters of the pit stop, 
including but not limited to the 
UCSD Bike Shop, the Price Center 
Food Court and the UCSD 
Bookstore. 

The pit stop had a sizable 
turnout, but most of the participants 
were UCSD staff members or 
employees of other facilities close to 
or affiliated with the UCSD cam-
pus. 

There are a number of students 
who bike to UCSD, according to 
Griffin . However, the pit stop was 
only available from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m., 
and many students do not have class-
es that early in the day. 

Reasons for riding bikes to cam-
pus varied, but maintaining a healthy 
lifestyle is a major motivator, some 
bicyclists said. 

"At my age, you got to do some-
thing to keep healthy," said Steve 
Cervantes, treasury manager of 
nearby business ViaStat. 

Overall, commuters say, riding 
their bikes seems to lengthen the 
morning travel time . 

"h's longer but only by 15 or 20 
minutes," said bicyclist Jan Coury. "I 
have more energy, I'm more alert, 
and in a better mood. It puts work 
into perspective." 

The biking commute also cutS 
down on stress, Coury said . 

Both staff and students cited 
environmental issues as a strong 
motivating factor. Students in atten-
dance also cited the high cost and 
inconvenience of parking on campus 
as reasons for biking. 

"It's way more convenient [than 
driving]," UCSD senior Rachel 
Agress said. "I save money on park-
ing. It's also faster." 

Living approximately two miles 
from campus, Agress said that riding 
to school takes less time than if she 
drove because she would have to 
park and then ride the shuttle. 

The UCSD function coincided 
with the San Diego area Bike to 
Work Day, as well as the statewide 
California Bike Commute week . 
This UCSD pit stop was not direct-
ly affiliated . Yet, it was part of the 
larger cause, Griffin said . 

"We really want [the students] to 
come on their bikes more often," 
said Sandy McCormick, the 
Rideshare Operations senior clerk 
and an organizer of the UCSD 
event.

UC nurses demand raises, threaten to strike 
The Califomia Nurses Association, which repre-

sents nurses at the University of California Medical 
Centers - including the UCSD Medicol Center in 
Hillcrest, Thornton Hospital in La Jolla, and UCSD's 
Student Health clinic - announced they have 
given notice for a one-day strike set to occur May 
29. 

The strike announcement comes after nurses 
overwhelmingly voted in favor of a strike in their 

onsoin~ negotiations with the University of 
California. Over 8,000 nurses throughout the UC 
system are expeded to participate in the one-day 
walk out. 

The University of California contends the strike 
is illegal under state law, unless all formal negoti-
ating procedures have been exhausted or any 
unfair labor pradices have been proven against 
the university. According to the university, none of 
these has happened. 

Pay raises are at the heart of the disagreement 
between the two sides. The UC system is seeking 
merit pay increases for nurses who are rated "excel-
lent" The CNA is calling for raises based on seniority. 

In addition to raises, the parties disagree on the 
amount of mandatory overtime nurses should 
work. The University of Califomia's current offer 
limits such overtime to "exceptional circum-
stances." The CNA says such overtime for ·unspec-
ified 'emergencies'" harms patients. 

Both sides agree a strike would be unsettling to 
patients, in terms of rescheduling surgeries and 
transferring patients to unaffeded hospitals. 

The next bargaining session between the two 
sides is planned for May 22. 

Med school professor to head 
American Otological Society 

UCSD School of Medicine professor Jeffrey 
harris was elected president of the American 
Otological Society for 2003-2004 on May II . As 
director of the UCSD division of 

otolaryngolo~y/head and neck surgery since 1987, 
Harris established UCSD as having one of the top 
10 such programs in the country. Harris' leadership 
qualifications include stints as chief of staff for 
both the UCSD Medical Center, Hillcrest Medical 
Center and Thornton Hospital. 

Harris' resea rch focuses on disorders of the ear, 
hearing and balance, and tumors of the skull base. 
He currently leads a large research team that, 
among other things, investigates the causes of 
deafness. In the past, he identified federal priori-
ties in hearing research as co-chair of the Expert 
Panel on Hearing and Hearing Impairment for the 
National Institutes of Health. 

Harris' honors include bein~ named an out-
standing otolaryngologist by I\merican Health 
Magazine" and "Town & Country Magazine" and 
being continuously listed as one of the best doc-
tors In America by '"Woodward and White." 

The American Otological Society was founded 
in 1969 and remains the second-oldest specialty 
society in the United States. 

UC ReJents extend retirement 
benefits to domestic partners 

Domestic partners of UC employees who are 
members of the UC retirement plan will now 
receive death-related retirement benefits similar to 
those currently provided to the spouses of married 
employees, announced the UC Office of the 
President on Thursday after a vote by the UC 
Regents. If a UC employee dies before or after 
retiring from service with the UC system, the eligi-
ble domestic partner will now receive benefits. 

Prior to the vote, only UC retirement plan mem-
bers with spouses or dependent children and par-
ents could qualify for the benefits. 

The UC Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and 
Intersex Association applauded the move, which 
would provide benefits to same-sex partners that 
were equal to those of opposite-sex partners. It is 
estimated that 2 percent of UC employees in the 
retirement plan have same-sex partners who 
would qualify under the new rules. 

The new benefits will take effed July I, 2002 
and will not apply to employees who retire on 
June 30, 2002 or earlier. It is estimated that the 
move will have a one-time cost of S139 million 
dollars for the UC retirement plan, with a S7 mil-
lion annual cost afterward. . 

UC study abroad applications 
keep riSing despite 9-11 

The UC Education Abroad Program announced 
that participation in the program is expected to 
increase 20 percent since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. 

If current enrollment trends continue, as they are 
expected to, approximately 5,700 students will 
enroll in abroad programs during the 2002-2003 
academic year. 

Since 1999, enrollment in programs abroad has 
increased by at least 16 percent. 

Europe continues to be the most popular desti-
nation; over 50 percent of UC students will study 
there this year. Spain leads all countries with 500 uC 
students. Four hundred students will study in Great 
Britain as well.

there will be fewer opportunities for feder-
al financial assistance and limited ability to 
locle in a lower interest rate on student loans 
from the government. , 

These are the hard truths of slow 
economies and budget cuts. The nation's slow 
economic recovery has forced the Bush admin-
istration to make difficult choices - choices that 
have traded government spending on post-sec-
ondary education and financial aid assistance pro-

grams for tax cuts to boost consumer spending. 
The cost of Bush's plan, intended to fuel an eco-

nomic rebound, is a budget deficit. Raising interest 
rates on student loans is one way to compensate for 

the shortfall in budget needs. 
Couple the House Committee's plan to fence in 

assistance for higher education with national rrends 
toward increasing college tuition fees, and a bachelor's 

degree becomes out of reach for thousands of students 
from lower- to middle-class income backgrounds. 

Given that college graduates ' can expect on average 
around $20,000 more per year in income than high 

school graduates, budget cuts that limit opportunities for 
students in financial need may reproduce an unequal dis-
tribution of income. 

According to the National Center for Public Policy 
and Higher Education, the costs of attending four-year 

public and private colleges (including tuition and other 
education-related expenses) have grown by 7.7 percent 
and 5.5 percent in 200 I, respectively. Both of these growth 

rates outpaced the growth of family income and 
increases in inflation, which grew at 2.6 percent in 

200 1. As a result, the proportion of a family's 
income used to pay for tuition and other college 

expenses has increased. 
Tuition increases disproportionately affect 

lower- to middle-income students. A report by 
Senate and House Democrats estimated that rising 
costs of tuition and debt could ~close the doors of 
college to 110,000 students." This report also cal-
culated that the proposed budget would reduce 
the number of low-income financial aid recipients 
by 375,000 students. 

In 1980, tuition at public four-year colleges 
and universities represented 13 percent of annual 
income for families from the lowest income 
bracket. In 2000, with higher costs of debt and 
increases in tuition costs, spending on college 
tuition grew to be 25 percent of their income. By 
contrast, the cost of higher education for students 
from the wealthiest income bracket remained 
unchanged between 1980 to 2000, representing 
only 2 percent of the family income. 

Bush's budget cuts only exacerbate this inequality. 
To add insult to injury, increases in college tuition 

rates have outpaced the growth of financial aid grant-
ed on a financial need basis, while there has been an 
increase in programs for students without financial 
need. According the National Center for Public 
Policy and Higher Education, in 1981,91 percent of 
state financial aid was allocated on the basis of need or a 
combination of need and academic qualifications. In 
1999, only 78 percent of state aid took need into account. 

Tuition increases rranslate, for many students, into 
the need to assume higher levels of debt, regardless of the 
cost of borrowing. The National Center for Public Policy 
and Higher Education .compared the· percentage of loans 
to government grants in 1981 to that in 2000. In 1981, 
loans accounted for 45 percent and grants for 52 percent of 
federal student financial aid. In 2000, loans represented 58 
percent of federal student financial aid, and grants repre-
sented only 41 percent. 

The State Public Interest Research Group issued a 
report that estimated the average student debt to have 
doubled from student debt levels in 1994 - to 
$16,928. The PIRG report warned that this level of 
student debt is "unmanageable."

A benefactor gave me a book called 
"Landmarks" fall quarter 
that documents Stuart 
Collection art pieces at 
UCSD. 

What strikes me as interesting is 
not necessarily the boole itself, but 
the fact that one of the few books 
about UCSD tailored for popular 
consumption is about things that 
only exist in the present - pieces of 
artwork fixed in the here and now. 

The book does document the 
history of the art pieces and their 
installation, but history is something 
that seems to be lacking as whole at 
UCSD. 

It srrikes me as interesting that 
so much of "Landmarks," and 
indeed whatever literature that 
exists about UCSD in the bookstore 
or in academic departments, is not 
about the past, it's about the con-
stiruent materials of the present: the 
lead plates that make up the 
"Talking Tree"; the "father of bio-
engineering" who researches at 

. UCSD - now; the stone blocks on 
which "UNDA" was carved; 
UCSD's home page, rracking all the 
newest discoveries. 

The book has beautiful color 
plates of Bruce Nauman's "Vices 
and Virtues," more popularly 
known as ~those neon signs on top 
of the earthquake building." While 
their primary motive is to make a 
statement of moral ambiguity, 1 find 
the simple flashing neon lights of 
human sins and virrues an emotion-
al metaphor for the way this univer-
sity often operates. 

Emotions, good and evil, flash in 
the dark, unambiguous and sani-
tized. We know what's right and 
what's wrong. We want to show the 

world we have the best bioengineer-
ing department at any university. 
We say we know that passing out 
newspapers mocking the death of a 
little girl is wrong. 
Unambiguousness flashes in the 
dark of good and evil. 

The only acknowledgment of 
our past comes from a wall show-
casing one event per year in the 
Price Center Ballroom lobby. 
Where are the stories of the 
National Guardsmen lined up 
across the street from our school, 
ready to clobber student protest-
ers? Where are the stories of stu-
dents jumping up and down on the 
roof of a judicial hearing of a stu-
dent protesting Vietn~m? Why 
have two people burned themselves 
to death in Revelle quad, and the

events remain a rumor to most 
UCSD students? 

I wonder if there is some funda-
mental insecurity in the omission of 
history, in the lack of a book about 
UCSD's history. 

The grown-ups at this school 
don't refer to the past; in fact, they 
dismiss it: "We're only 40 years old" 
is a cOllUTIon retort to the problems 
this school faces in prestige and 
funding. 

Lilc:e a teen-ager who distances 
himself from his parents because 
they remind him of what he is trying 
to grow apart from, this school 
seems to distance itself from its 
often turbulent past. And like that 
same teen-ager, it tries to distance 
itself because it fears and knows that 

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

those same emotions, those same 
unsanitary, gritty and unambiguous 
problems still exist: undergraduate 
apathy, lack of undergraduate hous-
ing, social and sexual frustration. 

It seems strange but indicative 
that UCSD's cure to the problem of 
misogyny in a society that encour-
ages people to defy stereotypes and 
be individuals is to make the pitch to 
males that they should not practice 
misogynistic behavior simply 
because a majority of other males do 
nor. Perhaps we have even lost our 
bearings of how to argue the moral 
high ground and instead argue by 
conformity. 

There are two interesting Stuart 
works that stand as ' a contrast by 
virtue of their willingness to argue 
morality and their simple place-
ment. 

The first is an unmarked drink-
ing fountain by Michael Asher right 
in the middle of campus next to the 
flagpole. It is utilitarian without a 
message. 

Then there is Jenny Holzer's 
"Green 'Table," buried under some 
trees in a corner of Muir, invisible at 
night. Shoved into a corner of 
.UCSD, it is covered all over with 
provocative aphorisms. As a table, it 
is utilitarian, but it is likewise carved 
with sayings such as, "What impulse 
will save us now that sex won't?" and 
"Change is valuable when the 
oppressed become tyrants." 

A provost remarked to me that 
the reason this school has so many 
problems with undergraduate life 
and participation is that the focus 
never was on undergraduates. 

A lot of old men set out 40 years 
ago to start a prestigious research 
university. Think for a second what 
the fruits of research imply: 
unblemished scientific truths. Open 
to debate, yes. Open to emotion, 
certainly not (unless emotion is your 
brand of science). 

And in spite of the fact that 
UCSD is one of the top research 
universities in the world by any

No free ride at San Diego museums 
Fiscal squeeze prevents late hours, freebies 
By EMILY VlIIO 
Staff Writer 

Let me guess: You haven't been 
to the museums in Balboa Park yet 
because you can't afford admission. 
Student loans only cover so much, 
after all. . 

I'll just break it to you now: The 
museums aren't going to offer daily 
free admission any time soon. As it 
rums out, they can't afford to. Not 
only that, ,they're pretty skepti.cal 
about our claim that we can't afford 
admission. 

The l11ysteriou~ thing about 
museums is that some are free and 
some are not. To delve into the mon-
etary innards of a museum is to com-
prehend why this is so. 

Most museums are nonprofit 
organizations, but they aren't cheap 
to run. You have to pay the docents, 
keep the floors waxed, run ad cam-
paigns, hire security and maintain 
the exhibitions. 

Just obtaining an exhibition is 
cosdy - a particular diamond exhib-
it cost the San Diego Natural 
History Museum in Balboa Park 
millions of dollars. 

How do museums pay for all of 
this? Charging admission is the 
obvious answer. The Natural 
History Museum raised admission 
from $7 to $12 during its diamond 
exhibit just to break even. But for 
most museums, admissions revenues 
only make up S to 15 percent of the 
budget. 

If a museum is lucky, it has an 
endowment, which is basically a fat 
chunk of money donated by a rich 
philanthropjst. M\IIeUIIIS don't actu-
aIJy spend the endowment. They 
cash in on me juicy interest collected 
by the principal. In some ases, that 

income is enough to permit free 
attendance - that's how the limken 
Museum of Art in Balboa Park has 
offered free admission since 1965. 

The mother of all endowments 
belongs to the Getty Center in Los 
Angeles. It has a roughly $5 billion 
endowment, with around $3 billion 
allocated for the museum itself. 

Museums also generate income 
by offering memberships, where 
members pay an annual fee in 
exchange for cushy benefits such as 
free adrhission and invitations to 
exhibition previews. Membership 
fees can be pricey, but at the San 
Diego Museum of Art, for example, 
a basic family membership costs $55. 

San Diego museums can also 
apply for money generated by the 
city'S Transient Occupancy Tax. 
Visitors to San Diego's hotels pay the 
tax, which is redistributed to various 
arts and culture institutions. The city 
also helps out by leasing city-owned 
structures to the museums for as lit-
tle as $1 per year. 

When all of these nwnbers add 
up, museums can offer free admis-
sion. But most of the time, the num-
bers don't add up. Some museums 
can't even afford to pay their 
employees - the staff at the San 
Diego Natural History Museum 

'recendy took a 10 percent pay cut. 
And when you're paying for security 
crews five nights a ~ and cleaning 
crews three nights a week. as the San 
Diego Halt of Champions Sports 
Museum docs, there's not a lot of 
money to throw around. 

The fact is, most musewns would 
need an enormous endowment 
before they could offer &ee admis-
sion. 

Admission from the Los Angeles 
County Museum of An generates 

between $1 million and $2 million 
annually. I ts membership program, 
which offers free admission to mem-
bers, generates another $8 million 
per year. If the museum offered free 
admission without a membership, 
about half of the museum's current 
members would probably cancel. So 
to offer free admission, the museum 
would need an endowment of $80 
million to $100 million. 

Actually, many San Diego muse-
ums do offer free admission as part 
of Balboa Parle's Free Tuesday pro-
gram. Park museums are organized 
into clusters that offer free admission 
on a certain Tuesday of the month. 

On the fourth Tuesday of every 
month, for example, the San Diego 
Hall of Champions Sports Museum 
offers free admission. And on free 
admission days, attendance goes up 
as much as 300 percent. 

The San Diego Natural History 
Museum might get 1,500 to 2,000 
visitors on a regular day. On a recent 
free day, it received about 7,800 visi-
tors. 

It's interesting to note that the 
museums don't offer free admission 
out of a selt1ess humanistic desire to 
bring art to the masses. Museums 
that receive public funding, such as 
the Transient Occupancy Tax funds, 
are required to participate. 

What's even more interesting is 
that even with free admission, we 
students still don't show up. Why 
not? 

The United States itself doesn't 
have a rosy track record for museum 
attendance. Only around 8 percent 
of Americans frequent cultural insti-
tutions such as museums, theaters 
and symphonies.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Budget: 
Student debt will hurt 
society in the long run 
Continued from page 4 
would only perpetuate this trend 
toward greater student debt. Due 
to federal budget cuts, students 
eligible for the Federal Pell Grant 
- the nation's largest need-based 
financial aid program for college 
students, which issues aid that the 
student does not need to repay -
are likely to see the maximum 
reward of $4,000 decline. 

The effect of the House com-
mittee's 2003 budget proposal on 
students financing their college 
education with either a Direct 
Loan (a loan awarded on the basis 
of need for which one is not 
charged interest until one begins 
repayment) or a FFEL Stafford 
Loan (federal loans awarded 
regardless of need) will be larger. 

Because new legislation will 
limit oppommities to consolidate 
loans and secure a lower interest 
rate, the average student bearing 
$20,000 in debt can expect to pay 
$5,300 more in interest over a 20-
year period. 

These costs will provide disin-
centives for students to pursue 
paths of higher learning. 

The cost to society of students 
opting out of post-secondary educa-
tion due to lacle of finances or abili-
ty to cover the rising costs of debt 
obligations is a cost thal the Bush 
administration should not ignore. 

Federal and state governments

junction to provide most of the aid

measure - be it faculty, federal 
grant funding or size - there's still 
something wrong. People do not 
mention us in the same breath as 
UC Berkeley or University of 
Virginia. Everybody keeps bl aming 
it on our relative youth : our "lack 
of a past." 

So, we sanitize. We publish a 
book showing the world that we 
have great artistic culture with 
deep ~nd optimistic meanings on 
this campus. 

We bury the controversial 
aphorisms and present to the world 
the practical fruits of our labor: 
gene sequences, nanomachines and 
sensor networks. 

We call ourselves a campus that 
has all the trappings of any of the 
great research universities of 
America without any of the history. 

And we tell ourselves that our 
problems with undergraduates are 
growing pains. 

Museums: 
Students unwilling to 
shell out for culture 
Continued from page 5 

Another factor could be that 
San Diego museums haven't been 
around long enough to build a fol -
lowing. 

Museums in older cities, par-
ticularly on the East Coast, are 
decades older than our own. 
Further, there are few big-time, 
dollar-wielding corporations in 
San Diego to play fairy godmoth-
er to our struggling museums. 

Financial capitals such as New 
York City are strewn with corpo-
rate headquarters willing to make 
donations. Similarly. the National 
Gallery in Washington gets 80 
percent of its funding from the 
gove rnment. The best UCSD can 
do for our free campus art muse-
tlln is 60 percent. 

San Diego's sunny kies coulJ 
be a factor in ollr general citywide 

dents who are unable to afford 
college otherwise. It could be 
detrimental to the future health of 
the United States and could hand-
icap state budgets if the federal 
government shifted too much of 
this responsibility to the states. 

One benefit of a higher percent-
age of the population continuing 
post-secondary education is a more 
efficient flow of infonnation among 
its members and thus a higher 
aggregate productivity level.

could also negatively impact stu-
dents' ability to purchase a house 
or provide for their own children's 
education. 

Nationwide, states have 
planned to slash budgets by 55.5 
billion over the next two years, 
and their public institutions of 
higher education have continued 
to raise tuition fees. 

By contrast, California, and its 
University of California, 
California State University and 
California community colleges 
have been the exceptions to these 

Perhaps undergraduates cannot 
be sanitized. You cannot separate 
their academic, social and private 
lives: They live and interact on this 
campus, They are the blood cells of 
the university, unlike the graduate 
students and professors for whom 
this place is a steady job. 

The undergraduates, by narure, 
fonn the emotions of this universi-
ty - its past and its future. Th~y 
cannot be treated as binary flashes 
in the dark of good or bad. Their 
perfornlance indicators are rather 
more complex. 

For example, one could look 
into a suite of freshman gi rls and 
see two engi neering majors, three 
biology majors (two of whom have 
nearly perfect GPAs and are well 
on their way to becoming doctors), 
a literature major who recently 
won a nationwide poetry contest 
and a psych major who does 
research in an on-campus lab. 

One can look into that same 
suite and find persistent and hor-
ribly damaging self-image prob-
lems, anorexia and self-mutilation. 
Perfect academic records and self-
damage can coexist quite nonnally 
- a paradox by which this univer-

apathy for the arts. Indoor diver-
sions in rain-sodden cities such as 
Seattle are apparently better, 
cheaper and more plentiful. [n 
San Diego, potential museum 
patrons spend their free time out-
side and their spare cash on surf 
boards and cover charges. 

One museum spokesperson 
flatly rejected the idea that college 
students don't go to museums 
because they can't afford museum 
admission fees. She said that 
admission costs only as much as a 
couple of beers and guessed that 
many UCSD students drive nicer 
cars than she does. 

Another idea is that college 
students don't frequent museums 
because they're only open during 
the day, when school is in session. 
In San Diego, museums slam their 
doors as early as 4 p.m. If only our

trends. In terms of higher educa-
tion affordability, California was 
ranked among the highest in the 
natioo, receiving a grade of an "A" 
from the National Center for 
Public Policy and Higher 
EduC'dtion. 

According to Gov. Gray Davis' 
2002-2003 Higher Education 
budget summary, CSU and UC 
tuition and fees have not been 
raised in the past seven years, and 
no tui tion fee increase has been 
proposed for the 2002 -2003 
school year. 

Furthermore, California pro-
vides financial aid for higher edu-
cation to all students. based both 
on merit and financial need, 
through Cal Grants A, Band C. 
The January b~dget proposal for 
2002 -2003 proposed an increase 
of 28 percent in total funding lev-
els for financial aid. 

Universities have historically 
raised tuition fees during periods 
of economic hardship, and the. 
systems of higher education in 
California are certainly nor 
immune to economic forces. 

Cracks in the armor are 
already apparent: In the May revi-
sion of the California 2002-2003 
budget proposal, Davis reduced 
UC research programs by 10 per-
cent and K-12 outreach programs 
by 528.4 million to adjust for 3 
nearly $24 billion budget short-
fall. 

However, California and its 
systems of higher education have 
retained their commionent to sta-
ble tuition costs, which is ' critical 
to making higher education acces-
sible to students of all economic 
backgrounds without the burden 
of unmanageable student loans. 

sity seems repulsed . 
The problem, like this article, is 

ill-defined and incoherent; but It 
exists. And I'm sure many under-
graduates would agree: 
Something'S wrong . here. 
Something is dead. 

You can sense it in the apathy of 
the student body, the relative 
obscurity ofUCSD and the lack of 
school pride. 

We have tried to cleanse our-
selves into a perfect, unemotional 
research university, and some-
where along the way, we lost the 
undergraduates and our sense of 
history. I argue that a sense of his-
tory and the undergraduate pOpll -
lace are two things intimately 
linked at any universi ry. 

"Landmarks" perceives a statue 
of a naked female with water !low-
ing through her wri sts installed in 
the middle of the UCSD School of 
Medicine as an opumlstl c 
reminder to the future doctors of 
their responsibilities as caretakers 
of the human body. 

I see a girl tortured by tiny pins, 
naked in the middle of a pristine 
academic institution - and silently 
bleeding from her wrists, forever. 

museums have tried the late-flight 
idea. In previous summers, some 
Balboa Park museums stayed open 
late on Thursday nights. But 
apparently, nobody wanted to 
hang out in Balboa Park after 
nightfall. (And, to get back to their 
money problem, the museum 
couldn't afford to properly adver-
tise the new hours.) 

It hasn't been a hot idea in Los 
Angeles, either. For the last four 
years, the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art extended its hours 
from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. with disap-
pointing results. 

It's difficult to depict San 
Diego's museums as money-hun -
gry monsters that exploit their 
student visitors by charging 
admission. Since daily free admis-
sion for San Diego museums is 
nowhere in sight, we might as well 
get u cd to the idea. Additionally. 
most museums offer student rate~, 
which is more than we can ~av

WHY RENT? BUY! 

You can: 

')<\5 a 3rd year student at UCSD I wanted to live off campus and have a 
place that I could go home to and feel comfortable in. I gave Tobin a call 
after I saw his ad in the GUARDIAN and because I was familiar with him 
after living in the dorms. He not only helped me and my parents find a 
great place, he iilso cares about you, which is evident when he calls 
periodically to see how I am doing. He has been a tremendous help and I 
hope when I'm ready to buy property later in life I will have a real estate 
agent who has been as wonderful as Tobin! Calling Tobin is a no-brainer 
if you are looking for a place to live."

Continued from page 1 
and the UCSD Pep Band. Live 
performances, such as the one 
by Ascension, drew enthusiastic 
crowds of several hundred. 

A number of srudent organi-
zations included fund-raisers in 
their booths. The Surf Club 
sold rides on a mechanical surf-
board, while the Ultimate 
Frisbee team encouraged sru-
dents to pay $1 to chug a Frisbee 
full of water. Whoever finished 
the quickest won all the partici-
pants'money. 

Some games even had politi-
cal overtones. 

"Our game consists of throw-
ing tennis balls at a pyramid of 
cans," said David Leland, a grad-
uate srudent and member of the 
Campus Greens. "The cans aU

Many srudent organizations

Srudents purchased authentic 
Korean barbecue, homemade 
falafel, ice cream sandwiches 
and free root beer. 

Srudents could also purchase 
signature Sun God shirts and

According to Ward, the 
daytime festivities were a pre-

well as how they construct these

Hein found that while men 
and women start college with 
greatly differing romantic views, 
they gradually reach more com-
mon ground by their fourth year. 
She concluded that while women 
relate romantically through feel-
ings and emotions, men tend to 
relate more through actions. 

"I liked [Heins) a lot because 
it did show that it is true that 
from freshman to senior year 
people do change their feelings 
about relationships," said 
Carolina Twombly, who present-
ed research in political science.

Concert: 
Equipment malfunction 
forces act to quit early 
Continued from page 1 
Chang, a Marshall freshman. 

When stage lights went up for 
Knoc Turn'al and his entourage of 
fellow rappers and DJ Reflex, the 
set was quickly plagued by techni-
cal problems. 

The artists chose to end their 
act, informing the crowd of a mal-
functioning mixer. DJ Reflex 
remained, scratching for a few 
additional minutes. 

Raymond and Daly rerurned to 
the stage after the premature end-
ing and announced they were 
going to fill in during the delay. 

The hosts also walked off after 
gum and the free glow necldaces 
provided by the A.S. Council were 
thrown at the stage. 

"It's pretty ridiculous," said 
Daly of her attempts at entertain-
ing the crowd. 

"We had to go up there after 
Knoc Turn'al and his group just 
walked off the stage after a nine-
minute set." 

During the performance, DJ 
Reflex changed needles on his 
rurntables several times to allevi -
ate the feedback, however this did 
not work. 

"There was so much feedback 
from the mics you couldn't hear 
anything," DJ Reflex said. 

The crowd had other options. 
"That was disappointing, but 

we just went and played on all the 
bouncy equipment," said Muir 
freshman Bekah Jones. 

A restless crowd was shown an 
SRTV video clip several times on 
the large screens adorning the 
stage. 

After a SO-minute lapse in 
music, several in the audience led 
chants of "Bullshit" and "We want 
Cake."

10 FEATURES 

By VALERIE NG 
Contributing Writer 

Many students at UCSD 
have trouble coming up with a major 
- something that suits their inter-
ests and career goals, and will allow 
them to get out in four years. That\; 
no surprise; choosing a major is one 
of the biggest decisions college stu-
dents have to make. It is also 
arguably the most difficult one. 

As a result, some strike out on 
their own and pursue an individual 
studies major. This is an option that 
is available at Revelle, John Muir, 

th 

ea ures 
THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

• • It 
a one 

Thurgood Marshall, Earl 
Warren and Eleanor 

Roosevelt colleges. Currently, 
Sixth College is developing major 
options for students, which could 
include individual studies programs. 

This program allows students to 
design courses of study in majors 
not formally recognized or offered 
at UCSD, but conforming to stan-
dards estllblished by the colleges 
and by the Academic Senate. 
Academic advisers suggest that 
these plans be made by the end of 
the spring quarter of freshman year. 

Students must start a rigorous 

process by submitting a proposal, 
which includes a statement about 
the purpose of the major, its rela-
tionship to the student's goals, and 
the reasons the program cannot be 
satisfied by an established major. 
They must also turn in a statement 
of support from a faculty sponsor, a 
list of prerequisite courses, and a 
proposed curriculum with a list of 
the intended COUI'se of study. 

The mentor plays an important 
role in the student's education, giv-
ing him advice and input along the 
way. Rather than being a part of an 
estllblished department stich as his-

tory or biology, the students' col-
leges become their departments. 
Individual studies majors are usual-
ly a combination of several differ-
ent majors offered at UCSD. 

The criteria for declaring an 
individual studies major may differ 
by college. The major program is 
required to include at least 12 four-
unit, upper-division courses from 
at least two academic departments. 
There is also a grade-poi nt-average 
requirement of 3.0 or higher that 
varies by college. 

"Students who choose this 
option are usually high-achieving 

True tales of a spedacular Sun God 
Being able to remember festival's wild eyents makes for a great story 
By CLAIRE •• VANNETTE 
Features Editor 

Much has been written about 
the one day of the year when 
UCSD acts like a real college -
that is, Sun God. 

Sun God is a day for wanton 
revelry, total madness, and (i~ my 
observations are correct) utter 
drunkenness. Sobriety is discour-
aged, to say the least, so the mem-
ories of the I'evelry and madness are 
usually reduced to hazy impres-
sions or the vague sense that some-
thing epic happened on that sev-
enth-week Friday. 

Sometimes, though, there are 
sober people like me who partici-
pate in the festivities and can later 
bear witness. 

This is that witness. Names 
have been changed to protect the 
debauched. 

Morning - Pacific Beach 
I woke up at eight o'clock, as I 

was parking my car at the Broken 
Yolk Cafe. I was supposed to meet a 
gaggle of friends for omelets and 
five-dollar bottles of champagne. 
Naturally, I found no gaggle - just 
Lorenzo perched on a rail outside 
the door, his bald head shining 
dully in the morning haze. 

"Where's everyone else?" I 
asked. 

He shrugged. 
I remembered the previous 

weekend, when they called me at 6 
a.m. as I was running late for a sim-
ilar get-together. In fact, I was 
sound asleep when I groggily 
answered my phone and heard 
them yelling, "Wlllllla""llkt Upl" 
Revenge is so sweet, I thought, and 
started calling. 

My boyfriend Josh was first on 
the list. A 90-year-old emphysema 

patient with a cancerous larynx 
answered and croaked a hello. 

"Josh?" I asked. 
"This is him." 
"Josh, are you OK?" 
"I'm sick." 
"No shit." (Yes, [ really am that 

sympathetic.) "Are you coming to 
breakfast?" 

"John, Tommy, Molloy and [ 
will be there around 10." 

I expressed my displeasure with 
this news, told him I loved him and 
moved on to the next calling vic-
tims. 

Michelle and Sam were unfor-
tunately awake when I called, but 
running late, as well . As Lorenzo 
and I were grousing about the 
lameness of our friends, a head 
peeked out of the restaurant door. 

"What are you guys doing out 
here?" It was Mary Ann. "We 
already have a table." 

"We" was Mary Ann and 
Catherine, who seemed sleepy but 
cheerful. Leon soon joined lIS, in 
mismatched clothes wrinkled as if 
he had slept in them. And finally, 
just before nine, Micltelle, Justin, 
Sam, Pete and Lucio showed up -
at the same time as my blueberry 
pancakes, I should add. 

JuStin started drinking the 
cheap champagne out of a coffee 
mug, because his fake lD was con-
fiscated at a bar last week. Sam ate 
a pat of butter, much to the disgust 
of the table. And then, at perhaps 
the climax of the meal. marmalade 
was smeared on Lorenzo's bare 
scalp and then licked off by Sam. 
The reward for this stunt: nine dol-
lars. 

Afternoon - Campus 
"Is thar an iguana?" I asked, try-

ing to sec around the thronging

and self-directed learners," says 
Catherine Joseph, dean of advising 
at Warren and the current chair of 
the Sixth College Deans of 
Advising. 

However appealing this may 
seem, this is an option pursued by 
very few students. 

"Most of the time, students feel 
that this is not in their best interest, 
since they feel that they would 
rather be affiliated with one of the 
university'S nationally ranked 
departments," said Nancy 

See MAJORS, Page 12 

masses on Library Walk. 
It was, in fact, an iguana, up on 

his owner's shoulder, looking quite 
intimidated by its surroundings. 

In a flash, I was tapping the 
owner's shoulder. "Can I take a pic-
ture with your iguana?" I asked in 
my best gee-I'm-so-cute-you-can~t­
say-no voice. He couldn't say no, of 
course, and as I petted the iguana, 
Catherine snapped a photo. The 
iguana looked at me sideways, less 
than excited to be headed for my 
scrapbook. 

"Is that a guy swimming in the 
fountain?" Gina asked, pointing 
over my shoulder. 

It was, in fact, a guy swimming 
in the Price Center fountain -
well, flopping about in the fountain 
and climbing up its levels. anyway, 
like a salmon heading upstream.

I went to see the shows. I liked the bands that 
were playing. 

I would like to see Tool, Incubus and Strung Out. 
I would like more punk rock and even some 
more rap. 

I am a fan but I haven't seen "Episode II" yet. I 
plan to this Wednesday. 

Spiderman! 

Bill Clinton, he did a lot of good, like with his 
foreign policy improving relations with China ... 
and he did good with our budget. 

A computer with Internet access, a CD player 
and some CDs. 

A can of Coke and a Milky Way every day. 

No, because they take enough out of our pay-
checks as it is. 

Yes, but it is hard to say. 

Not at all. 

Leslie Tanquilut 
Revelle senior 

No, I couldn't. I had a midterm at the same time, 
and we could hear everything from the test 
room l 

That would be cool if Incubus could come again. 

No, it is kind of boring. l think it is more of a guy 
thing. 

Probably the chick from "Terminator 2." She's 
tough and kicks ass .. . unlike me! 

Clinton! Even with all the bad stuff, he carried 
himself real well. 

A radio, a cell phone and a lot of Chinese food. 

Seven strips of bacon, two eggs and some cereal. 

Depends. If it is for education, yes. If it is for a 
ballpark, then no! . 

It's hard because you cannot take everything seri-
ously. He did his best. 

Yes. I think it has already started.

It was, in fact, Terry. Sort of. 
Terry was not himself. Terry was, 
in a word, trashed. 

"How much have you had to 
drink?" I asked him. 

He leered at me, and lied: "One 
beer." 

Terry sn:mbled after us girls 
when we left the Walk and started 
toward his Pepper Canyon apart-
ment. 

The five of us - four noisy 
girls and a stumbling Asian male -
amacted some attention apparent-
ly. One guy walking by sized up the 
group, pointed at Terry, and called 
out, "Nice ratio l " 

We laughed when Terry puffed 
himself up over this comment. 
"Terry, you couldn't handle four 
girls at one time," I said. 

Linda helpfully pointed out, 
"Well, he does have two hands and 
two feet." 

We pondered the logistics of 
this while we trekked across cam-
pus. 

Later - Pepper Canyon 
We had talked Terry into drink-

ing two glasses of water by telling 
him they were vodka; he didn't 
seem to notice the difference in

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

"There is no way 1 would have been able 
to pull it off without his advice," he said. 

Shapiro is interested in issues relating to 
the human-computer interface, and in how 
people manipulate formal systems such as 
language and mathematics. 

MONDAY, MAY 20, 2002 

Friedlander, dean of academic advising at 
Roosevelt. 

A total of 43 students chose to declare an 
Individual studies major in the last four 
years. Among that group, nine are graduat-
ing this year, and 15 students declared a sec-
ond major in the fields of history, music, 
biology, economics or Third World snldies. 

H e noted that most computer science 
undergraduate programsdo not pay enough 
attention to compu ter interfaces. He 
beli eves that the best way to improve inter-
faces is to understand how people interact 
with the world. 

Preferring a hands-on approach to 
understanding these issues, he has partici -
pated in the European Union's Playground 
Project. He also spent a summer at the 
University of London, Inst itute of 
Educati on helping to develop an interactive 
programming environment for children. 

ictp offers a proven program that gets IT professionals into 
senior level positions in the shortest possible time. It 's not 
the easiest program. It·s not the least expensive . It is the 
most effective . 

Ben Shapiro, a Warren senior, is one of 
the few students who has chosen to com-
plete an individual studies major. His major, 
symbolic systems, combines classes in com-
puter science , cognitive science, philosophy 
ancl psychology. 

T he individual stu dies program is perfect 
for him, but it isn't a piece of cake.

study of human-computer interaction. This 
major is si milar to programs offered at 
Stanford, M.LT. and Carnegie Mellon. 

"It requires a lot of foresight," he said. 
At Eleanor Roosevelt College, students 

have usually created majors that focused on 
a particular region of the world . In the past, 
these majors have included both Latin 
American and Japanese studies. Both of 
these later became official majors at UCSD. 
Some students also created majors in envi-
ronmental systems before there was an envi-
ronmental studies major.

"I think the individual studies major is 
great," Shapiro said. "I am a lot happier this 
way than with another major." 

He credits his faculty adviser, Richard K. 
Belew of the computer science department, 
with his success.

laughing at LoAnn and Terry, the 
others started arriving. Michelle 
and LoAnn informed everyone 
that they would make out for 
$500, and the pot was soon at 
$400. While we scrambled to 
find donors to comprise the 
remaining hundred bucks, Justin 
showed up with a pack of his 
roommates. 

"'Wow," Linda said entirely too 
loudly, "Justin has cute friends." 

The room was silent for a 
moment, and then Justin's 
friends cheered in self-congratu-
lation as we laughed Linda into 
humility. 

"Where's 
John?" 

"He went to a

Terry drank another rum and 
coke. Ten minutes later, he 
jumped on LuAnn and they fell to 
the Ooor, tickling each other. 
Suddenly, she shrieked and pushed 
him off her. 

"Oh ... my ... god," she said. "I 
just touched Terry's ... ahem. " 

(Later that night, still scarred 
from the incident, she would say 
of Terry's "ahem," "I couldn't tell 
what it was It fint; it was so JIM-

LuAnn's top-
lessness had 

earned us an invitation to a barbe-
cue held by one of Justin's friends 
in Warren. We traveled pack-
style, squeezed dangerously into 
an elevator and were soon filing 
into an already jam-packed apart-
ment where music was blaring and 
the residents looked at us 
strangers with suspicion. 

"There's no TP," Linda 
announced after trying to use the 
bathroom. We decided to leave. 

Two RAs and In RSO were 
outside to meet us. "Can we see 
your IDs?" they asked. 

We coopented without com-
plaint until an RA started writing 
down names and ID numbers on a 
folded, hot pink sheet of paper.

Stoner: 
There is a line between 
drugs and sports 
Continued from pace 20 
mone, and hWlWl growth hormones 
among others; but the basic concept 
behind them remains the same: Use an 
iUega! substance to unnatunlly shape 
your body at the cost of other natural 
body functions, These drugs are 
banned for a reason, and athletes with 
any pride at all should not debase 
themselves and stoop to the level of 
requiring drugs to compete. Basically, 
by taking performance-enhancers, 
these athletes are admitting that they 
acen't able to contend at the same level 
as their competition without the drugs, 
so either way they lose. 

Category No.2 is athletes who use 
drugs for recreational purposes. Now 
there is a fine line between the two, as 
there are some athletes who use recre-
ational drugs, namely marijuana, with 
the belief that it enhances their per-
fonnance. 

And these athletes ace probably 
right. They do play better with their 
favorite drug in their system - but 
most likely because they psychologi-
cally believe they will play better, not 
because the actual substance helps 
them. 

Then there is the athlete who truly

ationally, I don't see a problem. 
College is a place to tty new things, a 
place to have as much fun as possible 
before the rigors of the "real world" 
chain you down into the lifeless 
drudges that American society molds 
and spits out by the millions. Most 
college students use drugs to enhance 
their fun, which I thin\;; is the only 
accepuble reason to use drugs. 

However, as far as professional 
athletes using drugs recreationa1Jy, I 
think that's a different story. 

Professional athletes are role mod-
els, whether they like it or not, and as 
such, they constandy have people imi-
tating them. When professional ath-
letes are busted for marijuana, alcohol 
or cocaine abuse, lcids who idolize 
these athletes see drug use as cool, and 
they see their heroes rarely getting 
penalized for it either, which tells the 
kids it's not a big deal to use drugs, and 
that the consequences of being caught 
are very light. 

AdditionalJy, these are professional 
athletes - meaning they either are 
incredibly gifted athletically, and/or 
they have spent thousands of hours 
training/practicing/playing their 
respective sport. So why they would 
want to dull their bodies and senses 
with drugs, and go against all the train-
ing they did to get into the profession-
al sporting ranks, I have no clue. 

However, as far recreational drug 
use goes for editors of college newspa-
pers, especially the spons section -

Although the Triton volleyball 
team has not experienced a winning 
season during the past several years, 
UCSD will certainly miss Hove's 
leadership and Cogorno's court-
power. 

"Both of the guys will be hard to 
replace," Larsen said.

Koala wins brawl-

Continued from pale 20 

correctly by Ko8Ia editor George 
Liddle, GUllrdian sports editor 
Isaac Pearlman led off the game 
with a double. 

Former GUllrdian Managing 
Editor Bill Burger then singled, 
moving Pearlman to third. 
Burger later advanced to second, 
however both were stranded as 
the GUllrdian hitters were unable 
to produce a hit. 

Although the Koala players 
came up empty from their first 
at-bats, they set the tone of the 
game with their first batter, who, 
after making it to first base off a 
grounder, proceeded to test the 
fortitude of news editor Josh 
Crouse, who was playing with a 
reported temperature of 102 
degrees. 

The Guardian again drew 
goose eggs in the top of the sec-
ond, as both teams began to 
focus more on drinking than 
hitting. 

However, in the bottom of 
the second, the Koala drew first 
blood, pushing across a run to 
take the 1-0 lead. 

The &ala struck again in the 
fourth inning, as four members of 
their team piled up at second 
base, then all came around to 
score on a single to right field by 
Liddle. 

The GUllrdi4n responded in 
the second half of the inning, 
scoring two runs to narrow the 
Koala's lead to 5-2. Mer the 
Koala scored another run, the 
GUllrdian then scored four runs 
in the top of the fifth to tie the 
game, featuring runs by editor

then scored five more in the 
fifth inning - an inning broken 
up by two brawls as the intoxi-

sides. The long inning also fea-
tured several drink-offs, in 
which a representative from

each side drank a cup of beer in 
order to resolve a disputed call

As the game wore on, both

After an alco-hol-filled Sun

with the annual 
Guardian vs. Koala 
slosh ball game -
the ultimate mix of 
drugs and sports -
I began to ponder 
the relation 
between the two 
as I trekked to the 
Guardian office 
Sunday morning 
while the majority 
of UCSD slept in a 
drunken stupor or 
nursed raging 
hangovers, 

Other than slosh ball, which is 
rea llv more of an excuse to drink 
and 'brawl than to actually play 
softball , there actually is a defi -
nite yet quiet connection 
between sports and drugs. 

There are two different cate-
gories, although at times they 
might not seem quite so distinct 
from each other. 

Category No. I: athletes who 
lise performance-enhancing 
drugs. There's really not too 
much to say about them, I think 
they should all be shot. 

I have no idea why serious 
athletes, who spend countless 
hours toning their bodies in 
order to perform highly skilled 
functions that demand quick 
reactions and extraordinary 
focus, would jeopardize their 
bodies with drugs that destroy 
exactly what they are trying to 
enhance. 

For example, steroid users. 
While recent innovations such as 
Creatine may have decreased the 
overall use of anabolic steroids, 
there are still cases of college and 
professional athletes getting 
caught with 'raids. 

For those two UCSD stu-
dents not majoring in biology, 
steroids are chemical substances 
derived from cholesterol used to 
encourage muscle growth. 
Steroid users are characterized 
by rapid and vicious mood 
swings, from aggression to 
depression as the chemicals act 
on various parts of the brain. In 
males, high dosages have been 
proved to cause an inability to 
perform sexually, as well as bald-
ness, infertility and breast devel-
opment. 

I know athletes face huge 
pressure to perform, which is the 
motivating cause behind most 
performance-enhancing drug 
use. But why anyone would sub-
ject his body to this, 1 don't 
understand. 

Besides steroids, other perfor-
mance-enhancers include 
gonadotropin, luteinizing hor-

Track and field qualifies seven Tritons 
UCSD looking to score big in Texas at NCAA finals 
By KEITH DO 
Staff Writer 

UCSD track and field will send 
seven athletes - two men and five 
women to the National 
Collegia te Athl etic Association 
Division II Championships at the 
Angelo State University 
Multipurpose Sports Complex in 
San Angelo, Texas on May 23 to 
May 25.

ond seed in this weekend 's nation-
als. Also, his win last week came 
over Taras Rohde of Cal State Los 
Angeles, the top seed because of 
the 61'.75" mark he posred earlier 
this season. Ewanio, who placed 
fi fth at last yea r's meet, earned 
UCS D's only automatic bid to the 
national championships. 

Also representing the men IsJon 
Wong in the 1,500 meters, the 19th-
seeded runner with a time of three 
minutes, 52.22 seconds. Last season 
Wong finished 13th during prelimi-
naries in the 1,500 meters, just bare-
ly missing a berth in the finals field 
of 12. Wong had an NCAA provi-
sional qualification mark in the 800 
meters as well , but was not able to 
make the cut for nationals. 

announcing those teams officially 
selected to advance to nationals 
through automatic qualification, 
the selection committee pooled 
together all of the provisional qual-
ifIers accumulated during the 
course of the season and picked the 
top marks in order to fill in all of 
the event fields . T he announce-
ment came soon after the Tritons 
won All-California Collegiate 
Athletic Association honors for 12 
athletes at last week's CCAA 
Conference Championships at 
UCSD, where the women placed 
second and the men placed fifth 
overall. 

On the women 's side, the high-
est-seeded qualifier is Audrey Sung 
in the 3,000 meters, a 2001 AlI-
American in the same event. Sung's 
time of 10:01.41 earned her a sixth 
seed in the race, where she took 
sixth place to score all three team 
points last year. In their other track 
event, the women will be repre-
sented by Clara Wilson in the 400-
meter low hurdles, who wiJl race as 
the 16th seed with a qualifying time 
of 62 .52 seconds.

Tritons will head back to the

improve on last year's 29th place on 
the men 's side, and 50th place

"Yes it was [along the lines of 
what we expected)," said head 
coach Tony Salerno. "Some were 
nice surprises. It was pretty much 
what we had expected; we actually 
got more women in than we 
expected but it's been that kind of 
year for the women's team."

"For some of them, the sky is 
the limit," Salerno said. "For 
Audrey, she certainly has a good 
chance of doing real well in the 
3,000. She's quite a competitor. 
She's got a real good chance of 
improving [on last season's perfor-
mance at nationals) this year. She

"The way we competed at confer-

hungry for more," Salerno said. "I 
think we're ready to step up. With us, 
it's a real sense of confidence and 
most athletes headed into nationals 
have fear and trepidation. I'm reatly 
excited and looking forward to seeing 
what happens." 

Men's volleyball loses key two 
Hove, Cogomo say goodbye to UCSD 
ByANU KUMAR 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's volleyball 
team will miss two of its seniors 
next year. The experience and 
leadership of Jordan Hove and 
G riffin Cogorno will be hard 
for head coach Ron Larsen to 
replace on next year's squad. 

Hove began playing volley-
ball at a young age, and the 
Tritons have been reaping the 
benefits of Hove's experi ence 
since tht: beginning of his tenure 
at UCSD. As a freshman, Hove 

played in 57 of 82 games, in the 
positions of outside hitter and 
setter. 

Hove's leadership qualities 
were showcased during his 
sophomore year, when he pre-
dominantly played the setter 
position. Hove's number of 
attacks and kills went down, but 
his play was crucial to the team's 
success. 

In Hove's junior and senior 
seasons, he was clearly a leader 
for the Tritons. In his final sea-
son, Hove had 44 kills and 1,024 
assists for the year.

Sayonara: Griffin Cogorno (left) will work in his surf shop while 
Jordan Hove (right) will aim to continue playing in Europe. 

"Jordan has clearly been one 
of the team leaders," Larsen 
said. "At the setting spot, he's 
going to touch the ball just 
about every time." 

Cogorno played just two sea-
sons with UCSD after transfer-
ring before his junior year. 
During his first season on the 
team, Cogorno proved to be a 
strong hitter, accumulating 227 
kills over the course of the year. 

Larsen was counting on 
Cogorno's play to bring success 
to the Tritons this season. 
However, Cogorno was hin-
dered by an injury. The injury 
kept him out of many practices, 
and it prevented him from 
bringing his game to its full 
potential. 

Cogorno played in just 75 of 
98 games this season. Even with 
his limited practicing time, 
Cogorno still averaged 2.57 kills 
per game. _ 

"He's ' a powerful hitter," 
Larsen said. "But we couldn't 
have the season that we wanted 
to have. We really needed 
[Cogorno) to feel better." 

Both of these seniors have 
set post-graduate plans, which 
will be realized in just a couple 
of weeks. Hove plans on travel-
ing to Europe, where he will 
aim to continue his volleyball

Koala wins 
annual slosh .... 
ball game 
Guardian 
winning streak 
ends with loss 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Sports Editor 

In the annual Guardian vs. Koala 
slosh ball game, traditionally held the 
day after the Sun God festival, the 
KDaIa ended the Guardian's two-year 
winning streak with a 12-6 win in a 
game featuring six brawls, four drink-
offs and two players puking. 

Playing at an undisclosed location, 
game time was delayed two hours as 
KDaIa members trickled in late to their 
own challenge game. However, once 
enough members of the KDaIa arrived 
to field a team and the keg of Coors 
Light was secured at second base, the 
game began with heavy hangovers on 
both sides. 

The rules of the game stipulated 
that no base runner was allowed to 
leave second base until he dranlc a cup 
of beer, and every player had to drink 
"Booze-aid" (a mixture of various 
types of alcohol and Gatorade) for 10 
seconds upon scoring.
