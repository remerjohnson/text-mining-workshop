Third to Hold Hearings 
art ermanent Name 

By Ka thy Huffer 
Senior Starr Write r 

Third College students wiU 
have an opportunity to discuss 
the permanent naming of their 
college in a series of hearings to 
be held next week. 

According to Beverly Varga , 
Third College dean, the noon 
hearings will provide Third's 
Naming Committee with " a 
chance to get feedback from 
students, facu l ty, and staff. " 

The Naming Committee is 
responsible for acting upon last 
ummer's decision by Chan-

cellor Wil liam McElroy to 
suspend the permanent naming 
I)f Third. 

Varga said that at present 
she " has no idea" of the 
outcome of the committee's 
activities. The hearings, she 
added, will allow students to 
express their opinions on the 
future naming of Third . 

The major question that will 
be discussed at the hearings, 
will be, " What nall1e ... most 
reflects the goals of our 
college?", said Varga . 

The hearings are a repeat of 
last year's efforts to secure a 
permanent name for Third. 
After a sel'ies of hearings, 
surveys und u fina l student 
vote last ye-ar , the Third 
College Council recommended 

the name " Third" to McEl roy's 
Naming Committee. 

McElroy 's committee acted 
upon the recommendation last 
summer, advising McElroy to 
reject the Council 's choice of 
the name " Third". McElroy 
accepted the committee's 
advice. . 

Lust fall Third organized it 
own Naming Committee 
consisting of three student and 
faculty members. Va rg a 
serves as a non - voting 
participant. 

Varga stre sed that although 
committee members may have 
personal preferences for the

Chancellor William McElro~: 
i ' con 'idering converting the 
Coffee Hut into a faculty club. 
Although he said compensation 
is " not neces 'ary," McElroy is 
willing to "bu. out" ·tudent ' . 
who, the AS claims. m:.ty have 
. ' j u r is di e ti o n over t h e

If faeulty m embers 'upport 
the proposed club , conver ' ion 
could take place by next fall. 
aeeording to McEl roy. 

Th e A is currently 
investigat ing the ownel"hip of 
the Coffee Hut "to find out our 
sta ke in this," aceording to A 
Presidenl John Jenkel. 

Jcnkel remarked that the 
offee Hut "ean't really be 

used fo r someth ing unless we 
(the AS) agree to it." 

" To j u t turn it into a faeulty 
elub i ' disre 'pcetful " to pa·t 
student SUPPOlt of the o[(ce

He added that he thinks 
students wi ll be opposed to the 
dub, noting that it would t'l ke 
"away a nice place for t udents 
to eat. " ,

"No way" docs the AS have 
jurisdi<:tion over the building.

that student fund ' were 
" insignifie' 1I1t " in contributing 
to the ' once Hut's eon-

" I don ' t think the undergrad ' 
will be all that concerned. " 
added McElroy. " I don'tthink

But Ho lmes said that many 
undergraduates frequcnt the

MeElroy said he would be 
willing to constrllet a

He rem'lrked that any

New Policy on Vending Machines Urged 
Dear Chancellor McElroy: 

Your November 9 letter 
about the future of the Vending 
Machine Income has caused 
the Graduate Student Council 
great concern. 

The Council appreciates your 
personal attention to this 
delicate malter, but Ceels that 
there are as yet undiscussed 
alternatives. In particular, the 
traditional and vested student 
interest in the Vending 
Machine profits argues that the 
Vending Machine Program 
should now be converted to a 
student owned and operated 
enterprise, 

The Council proposes that 
you wke this action on June 30, 
1979. 

This appears to us to be Car 
more logical thun handing the 
student investment in the 
Vending Machines over to 
Housing and Food Services to 
su bsidize failing busine 
enterprises . The precedent is 
well established in terms of 
student contro l over the 
Student Center food services 
und the income generated 
thereby . 

Turning the Vending 
Muchine Progrllm over to 
students will al 0 reduce the 
probability of a marked decline 
in Vending Machine income 
due to the widespread 
dis lltisfllction that would 
re Ull otherwi e . uch 
dissutisfaction would no doubt 

leud to boycotts, negotiaionl of 
alternative Vending contructs 
by student groups, and other 
actions. 

The Housing und Food 
Service problem cun be met in 
other ways, as outlined in Lurry 
Barrett's June 23, 1978 study of 
snllck bur ol'erations . He 
concluded: 

I) Only a fraction of the 
Vending Mllchine income 
would be required to meet the 
snack bar deficit problem. 

2) If the CoHee Hut were 
closed, there would be no need 
at all to tal' the Vending 
Machine income. 

The Council understands that 
there is sentimental ol'Position 
to closing the Coffee Hut on the 
part oC some Revelle College 
Faculty members. Indeed , 
Council members have 
expressed similar attach-
ments. However , II caml'us-
wide deci ion should be made 
about the Coffee Hut ufte l' a full 
und open discussion . It is 
untowurd to hide the problem 
by raiding traditionul student 
fund . 

It is necessury to recognize 
that the Coffee Hut fuces a 
number of vere problems: 

1) It i fiscally unsound. 
2) It is remote rrom all but 

Revelle College, which has 
another very profitable und 
popular nuck ba r . 

3) It will be in need of mujor 
equipment refurbishing within 

u short time. 
4) It will surrer even further 

deficits when a full service food 
facility , including a Beer &I 
Wine Pub .md night service, is 
oj)Cned in the centrally locuted 
Student Center this spring. 

If. in fact. the Coffee Hut is 
being maintained in the lace of 
these fiscal deficiencies by the 
senti ments of a few [acuity 

Ie I ~ 

members who eal lunch there, 
there is no justification for 
using the Vending Machines to 
tux everyone else to support it. 
I[ the facility is muinly 
important to the Faculty, it 
would be quite reasonable for 
them to support it by 
.ISliCssment us a Faculty Club. 

The Council feels that the 
options need to be (ully 

explored befol'e the final 
decision on the Vending 
Muchine Income is effected. 

Your early reply on the student 
ownership possibility would be 
appreciated.

'Snide' Steely Dan Comments Disputed 
Dear Copy Editor 
(Barry Alfonso): 

Being a some-time musician, 
and a very opinionated 
reader/writer, I ma ke it a point 
to read record reviews, and 
being a student, I further make 
it another point to read The 
Guardian's record reviews, as 
well as the rest of the "Arts" 
section therein. Regarding the 
Feb. 2 edition, I huve some 
things rd like to say about two 
of these "A rt " articles , some 
good and some not so good (but 

informative) . 
The good remarks concern 

your cohort T ed Burke·s 
interview with Black Sabbath's 
Ozzie Osbourne. I'm not 
purti cu larly thrilled about 
Sabbath , but Ted·s introduction 
a nd writing style made the 
interview enjoya ble. Although I 
rarely agree with anything Ted 
suys (in his record reviews) , he 
nonetheless suys things in an 
intere ling manner. 

After reading the Sabbath 
article , my attention turned to 

your rel'iew of Steely Dan's 
Grcalest Hils (whi ch included 
in its title whut must have b en 
the climax of your career . the 
term ··Snide Rock·' ). Having 
l'ead this iJlticle, I [elt inclined 
to drop you a line, in the hopes 
that in the future you might 
refrain from writing reviews on 
bands who write beyond your 
comprehension. I won't waste 
your time by bombarding you 
with cute insults due to our 
differing tastes: it is ruther my 
intention to educate you, for I

ITT Case 
Dropped 
By Gov't 

WASHINGTON (AP) - In a 
case with potentially broad 
application, tbe government 
dropped conspiracy charaes 
and perjury charges againat an 
ITT official becuase it said it 
did not want to ris"· revealing 
national secrets in open court. 

On a motion by the Justice 
Department, US District Judge 
Aubrey Robinson Jr. dismissed 
perjury and conspiracy 
charges against Robert 
Berrellez of the International 
.Telephone " Telegraph Corp, 

He was accused of lying and 
conspiring with CIA officials 
during a 1973 Senate inves-
tigation into efforts by the CIA 
and I'M' to block the 1970 
election of Marxist Salvadore 
Allende as president of Chile, 

Sen. Frank Church, D-Idabo, 
called the government's 
decision "outrageous," 

"The government's decision 
based upon a spurious 'national 
security' meana that individ-
uals who take a congressiQnal 
oath to tell tbe truth will, in the 
future, know they are free to 
milead Congreas wttb impunity 
because they can rely upon the 
government to invoke 'national 
security' and not press 
charges," said Church, 

Terry Adamson, Justice 
Department spokesman, 
sought to minimize the 
potential impact of the case on 
other pending government 
prosecutions.

'Use, a Gun' Ruling 
Reconsidered 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - The 
California Supreme Court 
voted yesterday to reconaider 
its Dec.22 Tanner decision 
which weakened the "use a 
aun, go to prison" law, the case 
that cast a cloud over the high 
court. 

The court set March 7 at 
Sacramento for the rehearing. 
Ita action leaves the status of 
nwnefOUS state laws uncertain, 
includln, those requiring 
prl80n terms for beroin sale, 
attacks on the elderly and 
violent crimes by parolees, 

Voting in favor of the 
unusual move to grant the 
rehearing were Justices 
Stanley Most, William Clark, 
Frank Richardson and Wiley 
Manuel. 

Tbere was no indication of 
whether Chief Justice Rose 
Bird aDd Juatices Mathew 
Tobriner and Frank Newman 
voted to deny the rehearing or 
abstained. The brief order 
contained no addi ti ona I 
comment. 

Tbe State Commission on 
Judicial Performance is 
investigating allegations that 
the court deliberately delayed 
issuing the Tanner decision and 
others until after the Nov.7 
election, when Ms. Bird and 

three colleagues won voter con-
firmation . The chief justice has 
denied the allegations. 

The court's decision in the 
case of armed robber Harold 
Tanner declared that a 1975 
mandatory-prison law did not 
prevent a judge from granting 
probation in exceptional cases. 

Tanner was convicted of 
robbing a grocery store of HI 
with an unloaded gun, He was 
,ranted probation, after a year 
in Jail, by a San Mateo County 
Superior Court judge who beld 
that the requirement of a state 
prison term unconstitutionally 
infringed on his authority to 
grant probation. 

The ruling prompted a flurry 
of leJislation to restore the gun 
law and other mandatory-
prison laws endangered by the 
decision.

US Announces New 
Camp David Summit 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Egypt 
accepted an American 
invitation yesterday to take _ 
part in minister-level talks 
aimed at breaking the deadlock 
with Israel. 

Israel is also expected to 
agree to attend the talks, which 
probably will be at Camp 
David, Md., later this month. 

Tbe likely participants are 
Egyptian Foreign Minister 
Mustafa Khalil, Israeli Foreign 
Minister Moshe Dyan and 
Secretary of State Cyrus R . 
Vance. 

Egyptian President Anwar 
Sadat accepted the invitation 
delivered in Cairo by U .S , 
Ambassador Hermann Eilts . 
The Israeli Cabinet met to 
consider the invitation, but put 
off a decision until its regular 
meeting Sunday, 

Israeli officials said Dayan 
almost certainly would attend 
the talks. Eilts said the date and 

place of the meeting will not be 
disclosed until Israel an-
nounces whether it will attend . 

President Harez Assad of 
Syria, who opposes tbe 
Egyptian -Israeli peace talks, 
said in Damascus the issue 
should be handled by the United 
Nations instead. 

The Israeli-Egyptian nego-
tiations have been stalled since 
November. Shuttle diplomacy 
by roving Ambassador Alfred 
Atherton last month failed to 
get them going again. 

Each side has dug in its heels 
on what the treaty mean to 
prior Egyptian defense pacts 
with Arab nations and wbether 
the treaty should be linked to 
progress toward Palestinian 
autonomy in the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip. 

Eilts told reporters yester-
day he could not predict 
another summit of the type held 
by President Carter.

Contentious Council Delays Funding 
By Jeff Beresford-Howe 
Auoclaar ManaKln& Editor 

Racked by confusing and 
often angry debate, the AS 
Council Wednesday night failed 
to come to agreemaat..QD 
budgets for three campus 
publications , though the 
Council approved budgets for 
the rest oC the campus media. 

Commissioner o( Communi-
cations Bill Friedm.in and 
representatives from the new 
indicator, VCYl f'rontertza and 
the Polltjoumal and Council 
members (ought each other for 
over an hour and a half over an 
amendment to the Media Board 
budget by Burry Hyman that 
would huve given those 
journals about $6,000 more than 
Friedmun a nd the Media Board 
were wiliing to part with. 

the Media Bourd process, 
telling the Council. • 'I( you pass 
(this amendment), • don't see 
why you even bother to have a 
Media Board ... 

"We set policiL'S, and. don't 
think it's fair to throw out our 
figures in halC an hour. ' 

Representatives from the 
three journals, though, argued 
that the Media Bourd budget 
would cripple their journuls. 

Jon Bekken of the new 
iudica.... collective said that 
the budget would "disl-upt the 
reguklr schedule we 've had for 
two years," and constituted 
" prior censorship" because of 
new indicator calculations that 
only ten is ucs could be 
produced on the Media Bourd 
budget, rather than the twelve 
called for in Hyman ' s 
amendment. Bekken also 
blasted the lack of money fOl' 
salaries in the Media Board 
budget , and sa id that it showed 
"a complete lack of knowledge 
about the media ." 

thut status. Marlinczjoincd the 
Poliljournal und new indicator 
in supporting sularies (or the 
media. 

Friedman defended Mt.>dia 
Bourd elimination of salarit.'li, 
saying thut " I don ' t think it's 
nc(.'Cssary to the (newspaper) 
production process," adding 
that like most of the cuts the 
media was compluining about, 
"we just can 't u(fOl'd them. " 

The Council debated 
Hyman's amendment and the 
originul Medi<.J Bourd proposal

a h:JIf, fin:Jlly ugl'eeing to Muir 
Represent<.Jtive Lindu Oluf-
son 's propos,1I to take up the 
proposul ag<.Jin next week. 

The debute , the most 
acrimonious displuy in the 
Council so Car in a year noted 
for discordance in the Council , 
brought un angry reaction 
from Council members. 

Ann Carberry, Council Chair 
<.Jnd ASVP. wulked out of the 
meeting halfwuy through the 

media debate. after telling 
Council membel's, "you're 
making a zoo and u fool oC the 
AS." 

After Curberry had left and 
the AS had finully postponed 
voting on the Media Board, 
Council memben held un 
impromptu bull session on the 
antagonism in Council 
meetings. 

Carlos MODtalvo, Public 
Relations Commissioner, 
termed the problem "basic AS 
incompetence .. . people come to 
the meetings not knowing 
what's going on. The work 
should be done (before the 
meeting) and people should 
know what's going on. 

Margot Tempereau, Acu-
demic Affairs Commissioner, 
agreed, u nd suggested that pre-
meeting lobbying was one way 
out of a situation in which "no 
one know what's going on at the 
meetings." 

Focal point for much of the 
antagonism on the Council all 

year hml bt.'Cn lIynwn. He 
defendt.od himself. saying that 
he usually only objectt.od to 
i$8ues involving funds for 
"progressive" orguniwtions, 

" I 'm confronted with 
constuntly attucking the AS 
government," he S<.Iid. "I feel 
that u lot of you, the President 
and Vice President especially, 
are very much biased in their 
opinions of progressive student 
organiwtions on cum pus. " 

In other u<.1ion Wednesday 
night. the Council 
- defeated funding for the 
Communications Student 
Union. Thil'd College I'epre-
senWtive Sung Choe summed

Jim Lofgren, External

ceded that the AS had a 
res ponsibility to fund journals, 
but added that the AS also had a 
"responsibility to <I ll students 
on campus to be (iscally

More Bookstore 'Needed' 
By Pam Day 

S&IfI Wriler 
Increases in tha __ _ 

population have foreed the 
bookstore to expand its 
facilities, ~tore manager 
Dan Barnett said last week, 

Three major additions at the 
cost of a "very reasonable" 
$57,000 have been made 
according to BaJ'Qett, 

"Student population has 
risen from 7,000 t.breeyears ago 
to over 10.000 now. The store 
expansion process bas been 
happening slowly over (tboae 
years)." Barnett said. 

The money for these 
improvements is available 
thl'OUlh Rege9ts funds and 
should not C8Wle a price 
increase. he 

According to Barnett. the 

construction siles should be 
completed by late February. 

The south end of the former 
Camp Matthews Mess Hall is to 
be a "multi-purpose area" 
serving both the students and 
bookstore &taU. It will also 
serve as the new book-buy-back 
center, On the northwest corner 
of the building stands a new 
merchandise loading and 
receiving area, Next to this, 
flush with the front of the 
bookstore, is an unfinished 
sundry and specialty-type 
store, Items Uke soda and 
foodstuffs wiU be sold from 
there, 

"We're experimenting a 
little:' says Barnett. "Because 
we·U need ooly one store 
attendant (instead of a 
bookstore shift staff) , extended 

hours will be possible -
including Saturdays. Perhaps 
(there will be) a 7 a .m. opening 
time for students who need a 
blue book before an a o'clock 
class, It will also be convenient 
for those who had to stand in 
those long book-buying lines 
just to get a Coke and chips." 

With the expansion and re-
arrangements taking place, the 
aisles will be widened which 
will allow people in wheelchairs 
or on crutches to move about 
more easily in the store, 
Barrlett says. 

The complete renovation, 
which includes interior and 
exterior modifications, will be 
finalized in May. A "Grand 
Opening" celebrated by 
"special sales" will make it 
official. Barnett said,

For Men, the Cross 
Country Team is Back 

Jon Goetz 
Senior Slafl Wrilt'r 

Andy Skier hasn't resorted to 
the want ads yet. but he makes 
no secret of the fact that his 
men's track team desperately 
needs some help in the s prints 
and rield events. 

With a roster that looks 
suspiciously like Skiers 1978 
cross country squad, the team 
plans to rely on their middle 
and long distance runnerS for 

poin~s tlnd leave the rest up to 
fate . -

Tomorrow's II : 45 meet 
against Claremont-Mudd will 
give the coach the first look at 
his 1979 squad. Both schools 
have been hampered by the loss 
of workout lime during the 
rains. however. and their times 
might not be representative of 
thei r potential. 

Not all of this year's new 
athletes will be out for the 
Tritons Saturday because of 
Skiers policy of bringing his 
new talent along slowly. The 
veterans of the team, Skiers 
" nucleus. " will anchor 
tomorrow's competition. 

occasional 10.000. Jacobson, a 
national qualifier in 1978 , 
should earn another trip to the 
Nationals this year in the 10 
kilometer run , 

Junior Jon Halperin and 
freshman Pat Morton are othel' 
favorites in the middle ,lOd long 
distances. Solon RosenbhJtt. a 
1978 national qualifier in the 
five kilometer. and Tim Helms, 
a cross country runner just now-
resuming tmining. should be 
snapping the tape for UCSD 
later in the ::;eason. 

Three basketball pluyers will 
join the teilm after theil' Season 
ends , but until then the Tritons 
have a critical sprinter and 
hurdler shortage. The loss of 
Kevin Morning. another AIl-
American spl'intel'. con)-
plicated the problem. 

The depth in the field events 
is equally sparse. John Sereno, 
a decathlon competitor. is 
needed to help out in the javelin 
throw and hurdles , and in the 
shot put later on.

JODGoe&z 
SeDJor S&aff Writer 

Spectators at tomorrow's 
women's track meet against 
Claremont-Mudd can expect to 
see new school records set all 
day. 

Mainly because no old 
records exist. The meet at 11: 45 
Saturday is th,e first competi-
tion of the first season of 
UCSD's first women's track 
team, , 

Some joined the team arter 
competing on this school's first 
women's cross country team 
last autumn. Yet some have 
never competed in a track meet 
of any kind. 

That is not to say that the 
team lacks interest or talent 
though, " Fifty-two girls 
expressed an interest in the 
sport in the first year," said 
coach Graham Parnell. "If 
that's not strong interest I-don' t 
know what is." 

Doug Jacobson and Peter 
Dolan , who both ran in the last 
NAIA national cross country..

run the 5000 met-er race and <In

weeks, however, they've been

Tritons Split: Beat USC, Lose to Utah 
Swimmers Set Two t~eet 
Records; Face Whittier Today 

By PblWp Swller 
Diana Dann really moves. 

She was going full · tilt 
Wednesday checking and 
rechecking her swimmers, 
schedules, line-ups and results, 
and still had time to watch her 
women's swim team finiah 
impressively in a three-way 
'meet against University of 
Utah and University of San 
Diego. 

The Tritons swamped USD 
78-32 but were overpowered by 
the Utah squad 76-41. "Utah's 
got a good team but we did 
better than last year against 
them," Dann commented. "We 
had good times and a few firsts 
and we could have taken more 
but.._" Like her swimmers 
Diana Dann doesn't stop for air 
once she gets going. 

The biggest victory of the day 
came in the last event wOOn the 
team of Evans, Blaisdell, 
Thompson and O'Brien won the 
200 meter relay in 1: 49.9 - one 
second off the school record. 

Claudia O'Brien posted a 
new school record in the 50 
meter frestyle, but finished 
second in that event. O'Brien 
also came in second place in the 
100 meter individual medley 
and the 100 meter freestyle, 
though she had been eliminated 
f rom the la tter event because of 
false starts. 

The only other victories came 
from Andrea Wolf in the 50 back 
(33 . 1 seconds) and Janet 
Parkinaon in the 100 breast 
(1 : 14,7). Second place f1niahes 
came from Parkinson in the 50 
breast, Evans in the 200 free, 
Blaisdell in the 50 rty and the 200 
medley relay team of Blaisdell, 
Parkinson, Wolfe and Znelmer, 

"Our diver also did very 
well, " coach Dann pointed out, 
referrinl to Lori Demshki, who 
beat USD opponents in one 
meter springboard. 

"There's a lot of work to be 
done setting up a meet Hke this 
and very few people to do it," 
Dann said explaining her 
manic activity, "We really 
need volunteers." 

The swim team meets 
Whittier today in the nata-
torium at 3: 00.

Tal Ing About S"ex: A Topic SPECIA~ PORT: Homosexual S'tudents Try to CQpe With Loneliness "and Oppression Wh~ h ot Taboo At UCSD STUDEN XUALITY 
By Doug Campion 

Science Edlaor 
Fear and anxiety alone are problems 

enough, but when they arise from 
matters of sexuality, a topic so long a 
conversational taboo, discussing and 
attempting to eliminate tne difficulties 
often become seemingly impossible 
tasks. 

At UCSD. however, several services 
are available to help students solve the 
psychological. physical and emotional 
problems related to many concerns -
including sex. 

For example , the Sex Clinic , 
coordinated by Dr. Hugh Pates of 
Counseling and Psychological Services, 
is a forum in which all students are 
invited to share and discuss personal 
problems or seek information about 
sexua lity. According to Pates, "The 
primary purpose oC the clinic is two 
things: to offer information and a lso offer 
activities for what we ca ll 'theraputic 
intervention.' " 

Allhough uttendence at the Sex Clin ic' s 
weekly meetings has been decreusing 
over the pust two years, Pates does not 
believe the students at UCSD today are 
any less burdened with sexual problems 
than were those men and women 
attending the university a few years ago. 
"It might be that we see more students 
individually. Rather than coming in and 
wanting to hare inCormation in a group 
session, it seems to be more desirous to 
come in :md talk in a more private 
setti ng. " 

Pute , who estimates that he sees 
about three times more men than women 
in his counseling, said that the most 
common problems discussed by the men 
have to do with frustrations during 
intercourse: rapid ejaculation, penile 
pain and inability to m a inta in a n 
erection. 

The thera py portion of the "cure" 
always involves a building-up of the 
student' s elf-confidence. whether 
through more Crank co mmunication 
.between the partners or, if they have no 
partners a t the time, through a process 
called "imi,lge restructuring. " 

Pates explained: "Sex probably is 10% 
between the leg a nd 90% between the 
e;irs, so what the person a nti ciputes or 
expects will frequently occur. One of th e 
things that happens in the head is the 
fantasies thut we have of success or 
failure . " 

In image restructuring, the cou n elor 
helps the student replace the less 
desirable ideas he has of himself with 
images thut ullow him to picture him elC 
as being more sexua lly "competent." 

" Our hope is that through that type of 
rehear al within the im aginution that 
when the uct of intercourse comes, there 
will be a tran ference of the ima~ to 
active pructice." said Pates. 

Sharon Keating, counselor at the 
Contraceptive Counseling and Education 
Clinic (CCEC) speaks with ma ny more 
women than men in her oCfice ut the 
Student Health Center. 

"The whole sexua lity issue is changing 
for women ," ex pl a ined Keati ng , 
" Before, women weren't supposed to 

enjoy sex , they weren' t supposed to 
make their needs known. Now women.lre 
starting to do that, and becoming 
concerned with being orgasmic : 
receiving pleasure. So I get women that 
are concerned with not achieving as 
much satisfaction as they wish they 
could. " 

Partly due to this trend or growing 
sexual awarcness among women , Pates 
believes that "women are less 
demalJding of themselves than of their 
partners. But men are more demanding 
of themselves in terms of performance." 

Men have become more and more 
,competitive in their sexual behavior, 
a(.'cordjng to Pates, because they often 
attempt to size themselves up to the 
woman's expectations or past experience ' 
of what a sexual partner should be, It's no 
longer enough, he said, "just to be a 
' lover.' There needs to be some other 
adjective or adverb to go with it" that 
makes the man different from - better 
than - the rest. 

Keuting explained that while men feel 
the " pressure" of the situation, " Women 
- at leust some of the women we're 
seeing - are feeling inadequate" also. 
She c ited questions such as "Why am I 
not able to achieve orgasm? " and "Why 
do I feel uncomCortable initiating sex?" 
as being amollg the major sexual 
concerns of many women. 

Both counselors described the people 
they udvised a compos ing a 
" representative sample" of the UCSD 
student population. Said Pates, "It 
cert<linly cuts across all c lasses from 
ircshm n to seniors a nd gr<lduate 
students, and acrOSS a ll departments and 
colleges ." . 

About the stude nts' readiness to 
discuss such person<ll matters with a 
counselor who may be virtually a 
stranger , Keating said. " I think mo t 
people are basica lly open ." She went on 
to correlate the degree of a person 's 
exual activity to his orher willingne s to 

spea k frankly . 
FOCUS, the AS-funded student help 

line. a CCords the anonymity of a telephone 
ca ll to those who want to discuss a 
problem. 

According to Re velle stud ent Fariba 
Khaghani , a FOCUS " li stene r ," the 
people at FOCUS "are there to Ii ten. not 
to adv ise." The members of the FOC S 
taff will readily heur a caller out a nd 

provide often much-needed conver-
sation. but if a student ca lls with a 
problem th iJt needs "solving," the 
listener will refer him or her to the 
appropriate cCl mpus service. 

Although Page On e, in lower Muir 
Commons. did originally s tress its 
availability of peer counseling. 
according to Diana Stockd.ale of the Page 
One staff, lhe demand for that serv ice is 
a lmo t nonexi tent now. She explai ned . 
" I think basically . from m y own 
experi ence, people turn to friends -
usually of the sa me sex." 

While Pagc One will no longer be 
concentrati ng heavily on the counseling. 
each membel' of the sta ff has been 
trained with" at least Ii tening skill s, " 
sa id Stockdale. 

1. It's okay if a couple lives together. 
2. If two people 6ke each other, it's okay 
to have sex. 
3. Should homoeexuality be prohibited 
bylaw? 
4. Should abortion be legal?

Young Captures Mood, Spirit of '70s 
By Barry Alfonso 

·T hroughout hi s career us leuder of the Youngbloods 
and as a solo 

performer, folk -rock artist 
Jesse Colin Young·s style has 
been termed " mellow'· by 
crit iCS . ' Yet despite his 
reputation. the writer of 
"Songbird ," " Morning Sun" 
and other celebration of the 
ea ygoing life takes his work 
seriously . He has his worries. 

A mujor recording stUI' for 
over to yellrs, Young has seen .. 
chllnge in his concert audicnces 
that concerns his. " Very s lowly 
but very pl'onouncedly since 
197'..1 or so U1erc' s been 11

'60s the Youngbloods c'lptul'ed 
the frightened but hope[ul spirit 
of the limes in "Gct Together."

of.. .. Butthe assassinations and 
Vie t nam and the guilt 
associutcd wi th 1111 those things

fcel s more like a struggle to 
perform now." 

i\nwrican Urcams. Young's 
new Elekt ri.l 1Ilbum, deals' with 
thelSe changes. "I attemptcd to 
write 11 suite of songs for the 

album from ex pcricnces built 
,II'ound the post W'.II' gcneration 
- it's me tryi ng to ma kc sense 
out of thc lust 10 years." The 
lSecond ' ide of the Ip traccs the 
e\'ents in Amcrica from the 
optimistic psyc hcd elic CI·U 
through the violence of the late 
'60s and the disi llusionment 
that followed. '· Thcre ' s a

sang "Cmon people no/ Smile 
on your brother" in 1968 is 
coming to terms with the 
biltel·ncss a nd of 1979.

To listen to UCSD's Atomic

she continued. 

While the group limits its 
musical repertoire to modern 

compositions. the instru-

previous ye<lrs. the tltmosphere 
has been not unlike that oC the 
parisian Vielle Grille. from 
which Atomic C<lCe is modeled.

Simon's 'California Suite' 
Well Suited for Fonda, 
But Falls Short on Plot 

By AJlson Hall 
Nell Simon, known for his 

one-on-obe sparrmg characters 
as seen in The Odd Couple. has 
made yet another film of this 
genre. Simon and sitcom 
h<lving become <llmost 
synonymous. he fills out the 
deficits of th<lt type of comedy 
with big n<lme stars. rather 
th<ln wi th <I subst ... nti<ll plot. 
California Suite . like Murder by

and prestigious actors. differs 
in premise. The C<lIiCornia 
Suite is the c<lrn ... lion-colored 
Beverly Hills Hotel : the <lctors 
are parties of weekenders 
circulating in luxury. 

Cert ... inly the most intriguing 
<lcting is from Jane Fond<l in 
her bitter custody <lrgument 
with Abn Atd<l . The he<lviness 
incurred by the serious subject 
maller is finely accented by 
p<lrrying between Ald<l <lnd

subdued. restr41ined role and

h<ls the physique for these

Lane stlid that he first turned 
to books and to himself. "It was 
te .. ribly lonely at that point." he 
rcc,lIlt.>d . 

Most gay students do not even

One GSA Illehlber I'eeently

Lesbian Task Force Forms 
As 'AI-ternatlve' to GSA 

The Lesbian Task Force held 
its second meeting in the 
Women's Center last night for 
the purpose of planning 
activities for the remainder of 
this qua .. ter and [01' the 
upcoming quurter. 

Acco .. ding to Marcy Thomp-
son, the groUI) wus formed 
because "the .. e was u feeling 
that the Gay Students 
Association (GSA) wus not 
speakin?, to the needs of gay 
women. 

The eight women ut the 
meeting discussed possible 
meuns of "ra isi ng the 
consciousnes .. of the lesbiuns 
on cum pus to make UCSD gay 
women aware or thc existence 
of the Task Fo .. ce, " We're 
especially trying to l"Cuch the 
(gay) women on campus who 
don't have transportation and 
al'e too young to go to the bat's," 
expluined Thompson. 

The women also wish to 

become politically and SOCially 
more uctive on cum pus. 

One of the p .. oblems 
mentioned at the meeting was 
the service offered to lesbiuns 
by the staff of the Student 
Health Center. According to 
Thompson , women .... eceive 
different service when they 
inform nurses or doctors thut 
they are gay." 

According to Debbie CaI'lin, 
often medic:al personnel make 
assumptions ubo ut lesbians 
which simply are not true . For 
example, she said that nurses 
sometimes suppose that 
because a woman is gay the 
c hances .. I .. e greutel' that she 
has been exposed to venel'eul 
disease. Aecording to Curlin, 
though, lesbians show the 
lowest occurrence of VD of any 
sexua lly uc:tivc group, 

The Lesbian Task Force will 
meet cuch Thursday ut 5 pm in

Other iuue8 commented on 
included premarital .ex,

toptber prior to or in Ueu of 
marriage. 

AcconIiDI to Campbell, in 
matten concerniDI premarital 
sex, the couple'. belief that 
the), share a • 'binding 
relationship" is as important as 
the union's being official in the 
eyes of the Church. "About 60% 
of the people who engage in 
premarital sex end up 
marrying the person and that is 
their only relationship." he 
said. "That says something to 
me." 

Atkinson's views of pre-
marital sex were fairly 
practical : contraceptives and 
contraceptive education hould 
be available, and there should 

be a "recognition that sexual 
activities have relational and 
psychological e((ects, as well 
as procreational (enects)." 

Young had a different view: 
"I am not judgmental of 
premarital sex, but I have often 
seen it lead to disappointment 
and disillusionment." He 
mentioned that especially 
many of the women he's spoken 
with "found thut it was not all 
they thought it would be, and it 
impaired the relationship they 
had with the other individual. " 

Said Rabbi Miller , "In 
general (Judaism) does not 
condone premarital sex ... 
Judai m sees adverse con-
equences in premarital sex so 

its teaching have tended to 
condemn it. ,. 

About the decision to live 
together. said Campbell, for 
Catholics "there i no rule. The 
key word hel-e i commitment 
and there can be problems with 
commitment" when each 

partner has a different 
understanding of the re-
lationship. 

One of the things wrong with 
living together, according to 
Reverend Atkinson. is th.at 
there is no pledle. "It·s very 
easy to go out the door when 

. things don't go right." 
Young looks on it philo-

sophically. "I accept it as a 
reality." he said, "but I think 
the individuals cheat each 
other. Holy Matrimony -
which is not the same thing as a 
legal marriage - is not a 50-50 
deal. It's 90-10 with each person 
asking 90 of themselves and 10 
of the other person. I have seen 
almo t none of that in students 
living together." 

Cohabitation is not the only 
topic of sexua lity cun-entIy of 
concern to religious leaders. 
Homosexuality is a fairly 
controversial subject in any 
re ligion . 

In recent year there has 

Triton Sailors Set Forth Again 
(Continued from page 7) 
week. 

As a result , the team will 
probably not get a chance to 
practice in them before they 
face the competition Saturday. 

Nevertheless, " we should at 
least ma ke the California elims 
(the next level of compe-
tition), " Folkman predicted. 

The rigging on the new boats 
was specially designed by 
Folkman, a long with his friend 
Trevor Baylis, to provide an 
edge in intercollegiate 
competition. 

" Intercollegiate races are 
short, compared to normal 
ones. There are a lot of marks to 
go around. Every time you go 
around one, or tack, the crew 
has to move to the other side of 
the boat. We put the lines and 
things where they would make 
it easy to get from one side to 
the other, " he explained. 

Wind Change 
Anticipating wind changes is 

one of muny skills that can 
make a difference in tight 
sailing race . "An experienced 
skipper know thewind tends to 
oscillate for example. Also, in 

Southern California it starts the 
day in the south, and moves 
north ," Folkman explained. 

Sailing is pa rticularly 
sensitive to a skill every 
sportsman is familiar with -
winning protest . 

A complex set of right-of-way 
rules comes into play, 
especially when two boats 
approach a mark together. If 
boats tOUCh, whichever was in 
the wrong automatically loses 
the race. If one has to give way 
for another which did not have 
the right-of-way. a lesser 
penalty may be assessed. 

been much debute over 
whether a homosexual should 
be ordained in the Presbyterian 
Church, and theoreticully this 
remains ,I moot point becuuse 
the subject will continue to be 
brought up until ... homosexual 
is ordained or until the subject 
is eventuully dropped. 

Technicully the Presbyteriun 
Church has ... Iready voted 
ugainst the idea of ordaining a 
homosexual for three I'e~sons.

reasons were! l'e,II' : the 
recognition th ... t homosexual 
behuvior or lifestyle is ... threat 
to a "normul" wuy of life, and: 
the tradition of the Church. 

The Episcopal Church, 
however, has ordained u

which "caused greut conster-

think it wus a g ..... ve mist ... ke."
