Proposition 15 Debated at 
Third College Symposium 

Overflow Crowd Hears Cesar 
Chavez Call for Farmworker Aid 

by Tama TakabasbJ 
Staff Writer 

Debate on Proposition 15, the 
Nuclear Power Plant Initiative, 
centered on whether the initiative 
is a "shutdown law" at the Third 
College Energy Symposium 
Saturday. 

Held at the Mandeville 
auditorium, the conference 
featured a wide range of speakers 
who both defended and attacked 
the controversial proposition, 
which will be presented to the 
voters June 8. 

Hans A. Bethe, a Nobel laureate 
physicist who opposes the bill, and 
John Holdren, associate professor 
in the UC Berkeley Energy and 
Resources Program discussed the 
technical side. The soci<reconomic 
impact was discussed by San 
Francisco attorney David E. 
Pesonen, an initiative proponent, 
and Lawrence F . O'Donnell, 
regional director of governmental 
relations at General Atomic Co. in 
San Diego. 

from nuclear power is less than 
routine emissions from fossil fuel, 
Holdren pointed out the dangers of 
accidents, sabotage, mismanage-
ment, diversion of plants to the 
production of bombs and theft. 

Holdren declared that control of 
nuclear power should be placed in 
the voters' hands rather than 
exclusively in those of technical 
experts and industry.

"The United Farm Workers 
(UFW) is giving up on politicians

Monday in an appearance 
promoting the UFW's drive to put a 
farmworker's initiative on the 
June 8 primary ballot.

850 in the Mandeville auditorium,

removed. After five years, plants 
will be annually derated 10 percent 
unless the legislature-by two-

a IS-member advisory committee 
the initiative would establish- has 
confirmed the effectiveness of 
required safety systems and waste 
disposal methods.

Campaign to Free Prisoners 

Holdren said, "The nuclear 
initiative is not an automatic ban 
but an improvement in the 
question of how safe is safe 
enough." 

He stressed that current com-
pensation to persons and 
businesses in the event of the 
escape of radioactivity or 
radioactive materials is limited to 
a fraction of the damages. 

Voters' Hands • 
Conceding that routine emissions 

by James G. Soto 
City Editor 

Students at UC San Diego have 
"adopted" political prisoners from 
two countries and are working for 
their release through a campaign 
of letter-writing and publicity. 

The UCSD chapter of Amnesty 
International has been conducting 
a campaign to make the campus 
community more aware of the 
plight of recognized political 
prisoners in foreign countries and 
so far its efforts have been at least 
partially successful. 

Madeline Sutherland, a graduate 
student in literature, said last 
week that one of the political 
prisoners the UCSD chapter had 
"adopted," had been released last 
month after a concerted effort of

two-day symposium on the independence movements in Mexico and the 
United States. 

The symposium will feature presentations by both Mexican and 
American scholars. 

The papers will compare the reasons behind the independence 
movements in the 13 British American colonies, New Spain and the 
problems these movements encountered. 

Tomorrow's session of the symposium will be held in Conference Room 
l11-A at Matthews campus from 2 to 5 pm and will feature colonial 
historian James H. Henderson of Oklahoma State, who will present a 
paper on "The Continental Congress and the Nationalization of American 
Politics. " 

Then Enrique Florescano, from Mexico's National Institute of 
Anthropology and History will present his "Origins of the RebelUon: 
Social Instability and Political Disarray."

Gary B. Nash, He will present "The Forgotten Experience: Indians. 
Blacks and the American Revolution." He will be foUowed by University 
or Mexico City's Luis Villoro speaking on "The Independence of Mexico 
and the United States: ParaUels and Dissimilarities." 

Both sessions will be followed by round table dbcussions and a 
reception.

letter writing had made the in-
terning government aware of the 
considerable opposition to the 
torture and persecution of the 
prisoner. 

The prisoner was being held in 
Uruguary the scene of recent 
political conflict and alleged 
torture and harassment of political 
opponents by the government. 

According to literature published 
by Amnesty International, the 
group is an " independent, non-
governmental human rights 
organization working to free 
prisoners of conscience and abolish 
torture in all countries, no matter 
what kind of government they may 
have." 

No Political Interests 
The organization has over 70,000 

members in 60 nations and has 
consultive status with the United 
Nations, the Organization of 
African Unity, the Council of 
Europe and the Organization of 
American States. The grou is 
based in London. 

Fred Engel, a graduate student 
in literature, said the group has no 
political interests but seeks only to 
free political prisoners whether 
they be in the West, the Communist 
bloc or the Third World. 

Sutherland said that before a 
prisoner is adopted- that is, 
assigned to a local chapter for 
concentrated work- the London 
headquarters thoroughly in-
vestigates each case so that the 
torture and persecution of a 
prisoner is documented. 

The trCSD chapter currently has 
a prisoner in Iran and one in South 
Africa that it is trying to get 
released. 

The Iranian prisoner is a Kurd 
who disapproved of the Iranian 
policy towards that ethnic group. 
The South African prisoner, who is 
under house arrest rather than in 
prison, opposes the apartheid 
policies of that state.

signatures of registered voters to 
gain a spot on the ballot - would 
give the people of California the 
choice of whether the Agriculture 
Labor Relations Board (ALRB) 
should be assured funding. 

The Board, which exhausted its 
funding last January before its 
first year had ended, is charged 
with running elections that allow 
farmworkers to choose which 
unions they want to represent 
them. 

"The sacred right to vote must 
be guaranteed," Chavez said, " It is 
the cornerstone of American 
democracy. " 

Three Changes 
Further funding for the ALRB 

has been stalled in the legislature, 
primarily by a coalition of 
Republicans and rural Democrats. 

As well as guaranteeing funding 
for the Board, the initiative would 
make three changes in the law: 
giving the UFW access to the 
workers during their breaks ; give 
the Board the power to assess for 
up to three times the damages 
incurred if the union or employer 
breaks the law; and requiring 
employers to provide lists of 
potential members to the UFW. 

Chavez emphasized that aside 
from the funding and the three 
changes, the initiative doesn't 
depart from the law. " Last May, 
the growers wanted to know if the 
UFW would work with the law and 
not change it immediately. I told 
them we would." 

The need for the initiative stems 
from California's weakness in 
guaranteeing the right of everyone 
to vote, Chavez said. 

"Someday farmworkers ' right to 
vote will be accepted. Now the 
right must be protected," Chavez 
said. 

We have the People 
Chavez said he expected the 

opposition's main objection to the 
initiative would be the grower's 
right to keep the UFW organizers 
off of their property. In the United 
States, Chavez said that " property 
means more than human beings. 
You can own property, but you 
can't own a person's soul." 

Chavez feels that people have 
been very responsive to the farm-
worker's plight and the 
initiative. The UFW needs 540,000 
signatures by May 31 to put the 
initiative on the ballot. Already, 

they have collected 430,000 
signatures after eighteen days of 
circulating petitions. 

Chavez expects that the growers 
will put up between $50,000 to 
$70,000 against the initiative. 
"They have the money," he said, 
" but we have the people." 

Chavez was introduced by 
history professor Ricardo Romo, 
who called him "the man who 
brought us together." Romo 
credited Chavez with organizing 
housewives, students and labor to 
help farmworkers, " the most 
oppressed people in our society." 

Literature professor Joseph 
Sommers also spoke, explaining 
that the UFW needed the financial 
support of the people if it is to 
succeed in going over the head of 
the Legislature to get funds for the 
ALRB. 

Lobby Intern 
Eval uates UC 
Enrollment 

by Mark Stadler 
New Editor 

Andy Schneider, UC San Diego's 
Student Lob~y intern in 
Sacramento this quarter, is 
currently studying undergraduate 
enrollment problems and the 
University's affirmative action 
programs. 

Schneider, in a phone interview 
last week, said he is " really 
pleased" with those issues, and 
that his work is " really running 
well. " 

In addition, Schneider said he 
will be pursuing the inclusion of 
funds for Third College's Unit Two 
in next year's UC budget, which is 
currently being scrutinized by the 
state legislature. 

He emphasized that he will be 
doing this on his own, "as a UC 
student," because the Student 
Body Presidents' Council (SBPC) , 
which sets policy for the lobby, has 
not taken a position on the issue. 

In the area of undergraduate 
enrollment Schneider said he will 
be examining alternative ad-
missions standards for UC. This 
examination will include a review

Drunkbn Long Beach Police 
Find F'rotection In Civic Backlash 

IIy DuJeI.Sllawler 
A recent display of bad taste and 

unbecoming conduct by 11 
members ol the Long Beach Police 
Department is deplorable not so 
much because it happened, but 
because it prompted a flagrant 
case of crooyism and injustice. 

Over a month after the incident, 
no action has been taken by the 
department. 

On March 10, a caravan of 11 
drunken off-<luty policemen in-
vaded some bars in Long Beach. 
While in the area. the officers 
choked a woman unconscious, 
llSing the "standard restraining 
hold"; kicked and choked a man 
unconscious; threw billiard balls 
around a bar; stuffed another man 
into a trash can, and disrupted an 
arrest of a suspect by vice-officers. 

Incredibly, the officers were not 
arrested. The on-duty policemen 
did not even call for assist;rnce, in 
order to prevent a police versus 
police battle. It is obvious that if 

they had been 11 ordinary citizens, 
there would have been an im-
mediate influx of on-duty 
patrolmen armed with an entire 
arsenal. Additionally, they would 
have been. taken to jail without any' 

be 8&'Jured of immunity from 
persecution. 

It seems incredible that people 
actually condone such actions of 
these. The " Readers Viewpoint" 

----------- . column of the San Diego UDiOD 
Commentary 

show of brotherly love. 
In a country where there is sUI)-

posed to be equal justice for all, 
this incident is a bigger obscenity 
than "Deep Throat." But the fact 
remains that this is not an isolated 
incident. There is an analogous 
situation in San Diego County. 

Sheriff John Duffy has been 
known to hand out courtesy badges 
to friends and pOliticians. These 
badges entitle the bearer to free 
protection from ' police 
harrassment. ' 

In other words, the owner of such 
a badge can ignore certain minor 
laws, such as traffic statutes, and 

filled itself with letters from 
readers irate at the liberal press' 
handling of the Duffy situation. 
They were undoubtedly the same 
readers who excused the sheriff's 
deputy who shot a kidnapper's 
hostage - rather than the kid-
napper - in a much-publicized 
accident last year. 

How the minds of these people 
operate will forever remain an 
enigma to me. They are certainly 
not representative of the system of 
government that offers justice, as 
the American system is designed 
to do. The people that condone such 
acts are a greater peril to civil 
liberties than all the police forces 
of the country combined. 

Space Flight: Beached on Venus For 
A Most Unusual Coloquium 

by Johu Hunter 
The colloquium on space travel 

was in full swing. Rosenbloom 
from the Institute for Advanced 
Study at Princeton commenced to 
regale an audience of similarly 
distinguished scientists. There 
were also a few dozen students and 
assorted low life smattered in 
small groups along the second and 
third tiers of seats. I saw Swinson 
in the first row. He noticed me and 
nodded his head. He was wearing 
the same ridiculous shorts and 
sandals he had worn to teach my 
electricity and magnetism class 
for three quarters. His yellow 
flaccid thighs and calves were 
reminiscent of chicken legs in a 
fresh plucked way. 

Rosenbloom was now speaking 
of the various power systems for 
boosting a shuttle into orbit. It 
seems any sort of nuclear power 
was not agreeable for atmospheriC 

.burns, so now the question was 
whether to use solid fuel disposable 
boosters or conventional liquid fuel 
engines with a lifetime of 3()-40 
burns. 

For some strange reason, 
Rosenbloom turned toward me and 
said, "I would like to hear a 
student's rationale as to an 01)-
timum power system." It was a 
great chance to impress Swinson 
so I raised my hand and spoke 
brightly. "Chicken legs sir, in 
cluster for large payloads but more 
importantly, they could be fired in 
series for deep space missions." J 
blinked furiously as I realized my 
error and slumped back into my 
chair. At first Rosenbloom thought 
I was wacko, but after a second or 
two of bewilderment he turned and 
faced the blackbcard, apparently 
in deep concentn,tipn. From the 
side of the room I saw his twisted 
profile in the thn cs of genius in-
spiration. 

Einstein, Von 'leuman, Stein-
metz, all his predecessors at the 

Princeton Institute, had been men 
of genius. I considered it an honor 
just to watch such men think. He 
gripped the chalk and proceeded to

fashion which only became fren-
zied as the overwhelming brain-

child seized his entire being and 
motivated his drawing arm until it 
seemed to be moving with the 
speed of light. Sweat dribbled to 
the tip of his slightly hooked nose 
and fell in small rills down his 
flushed cheeks. The figure on the 
blackboard was materializing at 
an incredible rate. 

I glanced at Professor Swinson 
and saw him squirming un-
comfortably, trying to hide his legs 
with an old issue of Scientific 
American. Fat chance, J thought,

hide those drumsticks. 

I looked back at the blackboard 
and sa w Rosenbloom sla vering and 
panting heavily as he administered 
the final touches to the space 
shuttle: Its upper stages were of 

everyday design and might have 
been close copies of a Saturn V. But 
lower, on the bottom portion of the 
first stage was the innovation 
which would revolutiOnize space 
flight and make the farthest 
reaches of space as accessible as 
the corner gas station. 

At first, I thought they were 
small stabilizing fins but a second 
inspection showed them to be 
modular configurations of chicken 
legs. Rosenbloom had them 
situated on the corners of a pen-
tagon and they were wired to a 
firing system which provided for 
an initial voltage and then smaller 
voltages at ten second intervals. 
My mind immediately grasped the 
consequences of the setup. He was 
going to stimulate the fryers to 
provide the initial boost by running 
a ga lvanic current through them. 
Thereafter, the chicken legs would 
perform a side straddle action 
similar to the movement of a high 
jumper as he clears the bar. I 
chuckled at the thought, as there 
are some things in life which might 
be considered obscene.

President Veto 
Nine years ago American cities were turbulent. There were silt days of 

racial violence in Newark with 28 people kllIed. There was disorder in 
Cincinnati, in Nashville, in Cambridge, Md. The President sent 4,800 
troops into Detroit. Congress investigated; was it a red plot? 

The year before, 1966, Sargent Slriver warned that cuts in the Office of 
Economic Opportunity and similar agencies would have "great and 
grave" effects. These appeared punctually as the ghettoes erupted. The 
always conservative House minority leader, Jerry Ford, smelled 
Communism. "I can't help but believe that there is in the background 
some national plan," he observed of the disorders. 

Sen. Robert Kennedy said, "today the army of the dispossessed and 
disenchanted sits in every major city, in every region and section of the 
country." Ex-assistant Labor secretary Pat Moynihan saw the 
emergence of an "urban lower class" whose upward thrust was a social 
as well as a racial phenomenon. Four national black leaders ple~ded 
against the riots: Martin Luther King, Jr., A. Philip Randolph, Roy 
Wilkins and Whitney Young. King, of course, was soon to be shot down, 
followed by more riots. 

Violence is under the surface of public life; always waiting. The curious 
thing is that economic circumstances during the clashes of the 60's was 
better than it is today. Unemployment level is around 7.5 percent; the 
current official estimate of black teen-age unemployment is an almost 
incredible 35.9 percent. But where are the riots , the upward pressure? 
Cushioned partly, perhaps, by general assistance programs, by unem-
ployment insurance, by food stamps. 

The country has forgotten what happened a few years back; we hope it 
will last, that the poor will remain patient. The presidential candidates 
generally tiptoe around the sensitive issue, particularly race. When 
Jimmy Carter stubs his toe on the tabooed subject of " ethnic purity" his ., 
rivals rejoice, but few take up the real issue of segregated suburbs 
around decaying central cities. The silence is as complete and Victorian 
as it would be if a child at a garden party brighUy announced to the 
hostess, "Ma, that drain is overflowing again!" 

Great domestic issues cry for discussion in this election but aren't 
being discussed; maybe they will be later after the primaries. The 
Democrats have a big opportunity if they can find a candidate who can 
put it all together. Curiously enough so far it is Ford who comes closest to 
the vital matters though by declaring what he won't let Congress do. 

Ford is wonderfully benefitted by having Ronald Reagan as an an-
tagonist. He makes the President look good. Reagan explained the other 
day, "There is only one cause for inflation: government spending more 
than goverrunent takes in." A statement like that makes Ford look 
profound, and after one of his sparring matches with the Governor he 
appears like a strong, decisive leader. 

If and when Reagan is disposed of the real battle will start, and it will 
center on the Ford vetoes. They symbolize, in 1976, the historic political 
cleavage between the parties over the role of goverrunent to the economy 
and to the individual. Who will articulate the Democrats' side? It is a 
complicated subject and Hubert Humphrey, for one, is raring to go. 

One reason America's big cities are so quiet is that we are spending 
enormous sums in general assistance programs to keep them quiet. 
These jumped 31.4 percent last year to the startling figure of $27.8 billion. 
Is it too high? Of course it is; it is high because unemployment is high, 
and for every one percent increase in umemployment there is a 
corresponding loss of $14 billion in Federal tax revenues and an ad-
ditional cost of $2 billion for unemployment compensation. If we could cut 
unemployment back to 1967 levels we could save the government $59 
billion and cancel the deficit. As economist Walter Heller said on Meet the 
Press the other day, " We are $150 billion below our output potential; it is 
just ridiculous not to make faster use of that unused potential." 

The economy is improving at a slow rate, and it should help Mr. Ford in 
the election because inevitably the direction of the economy is more 
important to the voters than the actual level. The difficulty is that 
recovery is slow and that Ford has repeatedly seemed to be putting on the 
brakes. Democrats argue that it is they who stimulated recovery over the 
President's veto. The voters can decide if it ever gets to them. 

The recession isn't over, of course. There have been six post-war 
recessions and we are still below the trough (low point ) of the other five . 

>, , 

, .. 

This Nixon-Ford recession is the deepest in 40 years. " 

Walter Heller and liberal economists could be wrong; they consider the 
Ford hold-the-line budget inadequate, and warn of continued recession 
next year with continued extraordinary unemployment. The latter is 
actually budgeted for in the projections ofthe Ford stable of conservative 
economists. 

Ford isn't ashamed of his vetoes, he proclaims them. It has been 
government·by-veto, often near stalemate since he took office and it will 
so continue if he is elected, for he will almost certainly have another 
Democratic Congress. "I will veto them again, and again, and again," he 
tells audiences. As this is written, his score is 48, in 20 short months, with 
others in line ahead like advancing telegraph poles. Nixon had only 43 
vetoes; Herbert Hoover 37; Johnson 30. This is a new kind of government. 

Ford makes it the issue and rejoiCes in it, against "those reckless 
spending bills." Like Reagan, he argues that spending causes inflation, 
though he doesn't make it the sole cause. He attacks the bureaucrats as 
do some Democrats. (It would be nice just once to hear somebody 
recognize the disinterested devotion with which many abused 
bureaucrats serve their country.) 

Vetoes by Ford include school lunch and veterans' bills, strip mining ' 
and air pollution controls, federal aid to the indigent and idle, public 
employment, housing subsidies, public works, aid for the handicapped, 
tax cuts, job training and many others. If ever there was a set-up for a 
fiery attack by an opposition party, this is it.

Stomach cancer used to be the 
most deadly of neoplasms in the 
US. Over the past 40 years its in- . 
cidence has steadily dropped; it 
currently ranks behind lung, col<>-
rectal, and breast cancer as a 
killer. About 20,000 Americans a 
year are afflicted by it, and only lO-
IS per cent are surgically cured. Its 
incidence is typically found to be 
higher in lower socioeconomic 

several populations with higher 
rates of stomach cancer, 
especially the Scandinavians, are 
known to consume large amounts 
of such hydrocarbons by eating 
smoked fish and meats. Coal 
miners in Utah have been koown to 
have a several-fold increased risk, 
presumably due to hydrocarbon 
exposure. Vitamin A sup-
plementation has been shown to 
inhibit DMBA induction of stomach 
cancers in Golden Hamsters; the

evidently are not the main factor in 
others. A more likely candidate for 
this role is the group of car· 
cinogens known as nitrosamines. It 
has been known for several 
decades that orally ingested 
nitrosamines will produce stomach 
cancers in many animal species, 
but the significance of this result 
for human carcinogenesis did not 
become apparent until it was 
demonstrated that under typical 
conditions of gastric acidity, nitrite 
combined spontaneously with 
secondary amines to produce 
nitrosamines. It was then 
demonstrated that stomach cancer 
could be induced in animals by 
feeding of econdary amines along 
with nitrite. ' 

In order to understand the 
varying epidemiologic patterns in 
stomach cancer, it is necessary to 
understand conditions which 
determine nitrite levels in foods . 
Attention has been focused on the 
llSe of nitrite as an anti-botulism 
preservative and as a coloring and 
flavoring agent in various meat 
products. It has been shown that 
levels of nitrite sufficient to 
prevent C. botulinum infestation 
are so low as to present a relatively 
insignificant carcinogenic hazard. 
Norway has banned the use of

concentrations has been suggested 
by Weisbur~er and others (Cancer 
Research 35 (1975), 3469): the 
bacterial reduction of food nitrates 
to form nitrites. Nitrates are used 
as preservatives, colOring and 

Changing practices of nitrite 
addition cannot account for the 
dramatic drop in stomach cancer 
incidence which has occurred in 
the US and other Western nations.

Rallies 
The pro/anti (select one) - (fill in the blank) rally on Revelle plaza: 
A young student is laboriously explaining his pet theory connecting 

British imperialism in the 19th century with the ~ov: 25.Saxon ~em~n­
stration that got out of hand. Of the failure of urbaruza~l?n 10 ~barua wIth 
the Boston school integration battles. Or mercantilism With faculty 
tenure battles. 

It doesn't matter. 
The point is - most rallies at UCSD are disorganized, pretentious and 

overly long. I mean, they're boring. . ' 
This isn't to say that rallies on campus aren't infor',llative. ~ar from It. 

They can be very good for dispensing hard-to-get mformatlon, or for 
presenting a point of view. 

But they don't have to be dull. 

The speaker drones on, adding examples in support of his thesis. The 
theory gains a life of its own, g~ows more complex, some would even say 
out of control. It has spread all over the landscape, with argument and 
counterargument juxtaposed in messy arrangements. .

Staff writer 

UCSD's Student Health Center 
has added dental and op-
tometrical clinics and offerin,$ ser-
vices to students and their spouses 
for " special student rates." 

The dental group, comprised of 
three doctors and two hygieniSts, 
provides basic dental services -
fillings, simple extractions, 
general examinations, - and 
conducts a preventive care 
program. Patients are instructed 
on tooth tare while having their 
teeth cleaned. According to chief 
dentist, Whitney Jones, this 
program is an important and 
popula r part of the clinic. 

The visual care facility offers 
general examinations, prescrip-
tions and eyeglass dispension and 
repair, (contact lense jobs are not 
done.) Optometrist Denton Kimbal 
occasionally will take emergency 
cases, though usually ap-
pointments must be made one 
month in advance. 

Both clinics, as well as the Ilasic 
health center, remain open during 
the summer months, though in a 
limited capacity. All continuing 

Revelle Reporter 

students may use the center, but 
student health insurance ends "on 
the midnight before the first day of 
the summer quarter". Those who 

wish to continue this insurance for 
the summer may apply, (paying a 
premiwn,) towards the end of the 
spring quarter. 

Murphy's Reject Of Space 
Plan Discussed In Coop 

by Ken Stlpanov 
Staff Writer 

Vice-chancellor and Dean of 
Student Affairs George Murphy's 
rejection of the BudgeVResource 
Group's (BRG ) space allocation 
plan was discussed Monday night. 

Just as the BRG had feared, 
Murphy rejected the plan 
primarily because the Triton 
Times had been allocated space 
other than that which had been 
designed for it. 

Meeting Called 
BRG member Monty Reed called 

for a meeting noon Friday of all 
interested student groups to 
discuss the decision and to draw up 
a plan of action. 

The location of the meeting 
would be available from EDNA, 
said Reed. 

The Coop was unable to vote a 
resolution of its own because there 
was no quorum at the time the 
issue was presented. 

The Coop also discussed the 
possibility of setting up a 
mechanism to insure the racial and 
sexual balance of the BRG. 

Mark Fingerman, Coop ap-
pointments and evaluations 
coordinator, said his committee 
would develop a proposal for the 
Coop in the near future. 

Some members expressed their 
desire to have revisions made in 
the original Coop proposal to 
formalize and clarify the 
document. 

The steering committee was 
instructed to develop a working 
paper on the subject and present it 
to the Coop next week. Some members of the audience soon realize they have better thmgs to 

do like math homework or housecleaning. They feel vaguely guilty about 
l~ving the rally and all the pithy information that is bound to be forth-
coming. But they leave. 

Finally the first speaker is done . The sec?nd, .featured spea~er takes 
the mike and starts his harangue. But by thiS pomt the crowd IS halved. 
The second speaker is good. He has done resear~h like the fir~t speak.er, 
but has laid out his information in a manner that IS Simple and mterest10g 
to his listeners. The crowd grows, until it reachers its origina 1 size. 

Yearly Rite Of Room Draw--New Living 
The point of this scenario is simple: UCSD rallies break down early ?n. 

Arrangements For Next Year 
They have great potential, but it isn't realized. The people who orgaruze 
them must not know what they're doing. 

To start with, campus rallies never begin on time. They are always at 
least 10-15 minutes late_ 

The first speaker, who introduces the others, usually fails. to catch the 
listeners' interest. The introducer (master of ceremorues) merely 
proclaims the purpose of the rally, without trying to snag the emotions or 
interests of the crowd. 

The next speaker is inevitably, almost fatefully d.ull. This speak~r 
always has a point to make, an esoteric and pseudo-radical class analyslS 
connecting obscure points in time and space. This speaker mana~es to 
lose a goodly portion of the audience that has straggled over to listen. 
(They have to come close to listen, as the PA system usually breaks 
down.) .. 

Finally the featured speaker, the good talker, comes on. thiS IS ~he 
person that everyone, or at least half the crowd, has waited for. The t~g 
is, this speaker comes on at least 30 minutes after the scheduled startlOg 
time. 

UCSD rally organizers could learn a good lesson from the Cesar Chavez 
rally for the Farmworkers Initiative Monday. The Cha~ez r~lly was well 
organized from the start. It didn't begin on time, but five rrunutes early, 
with entertainment from Chicano guitarists. 

.The musicians' purpose was obvious. They were tr~ere to prime the 
audience to give Chavez a good reception. (Not that thlS was necessar~. 
The people at the Mandeville center Monday loved. Chavez.) After theIr

ANNOUNCEMENTS

Staff Writer 

The big concern in Revelle these 
days, besides the omnipresent 
homework, is " rooms." This week 
the yearly rite of " room draw" is 
being enacted. Seniors wishing to 
remain on campus get first choice 
as to the room or suite they wish to 
occupy next year, with juniors, 
sophomores, and freshmen lining 
up behind them. Incoming fresh-
men, as many know from ex-
perience, get the leftovers. 

Next year there will be a new 
type of living arrangement, the 
theme house. There will be the 
German House, housing about 30 
people interested in German 
culture and language. Only Ger-
man will be spoken. An entire

Wednu day, April ZI, m. 

·Rallies ... 
900 strong and lining the aisles, were screaming in and raising their fists 
in salute. 

Chavez walked out, small, quiet and dignified. The crowd came to its 
feet in rousing applause. He acknowledged it with a little smile. 

Chavez talked for 20 minutes, laying out the UFW's position. [n simple 
and unassuming language he told his story, presenting a compelling case 
of the need for the farmworkers initiative. He was confident and very, 
very persuasive. (It was reported that 50 persons signed up to help with 
the initiative drive after the rally.) 

UCSD rally organizers should pattern their rallies on the Chavez 
mode I. Of course, they will be at a distinct disadvantage. 

They won't have Chavez. The man was sincere and loving. He stood 
there and told the audience he trusted them. He said all he wants is that 
farmworkers get the chance, their democratic right , to pick a union. 
" They might pick us, they might pick the Teamsters, they might not want 
a Wlion. We just want to give them the chance." 

But, beyond having as feature attraction one of the few remaining 
American heroes, the Chavez rally was extremely well organized. 

UCSD rallies should be the same way, or even more so, because they 
don't have that draw, the attraction. Students are busy, and easily 
distracted. Rallies have to be well organized, or people aren't going to 
stick around and listen.

Stomach Cancer ... 
flavoring agents in fish and meats, 
usually at much higher levels than 
nitrites; they also occur spon-
taneously in soil or are used as 
fertilizer, and thus appear in crops 
grown in such soil. Chile (a high 
stomach cancer area) has ex-
tremely high levels of soil nitrates, 
and correlations have been made 
between soil nitrate levels and 
gastric cancer incidence in the 
various provinces in Chile. 

Weisburger and others have 
demonstrated that intensive 
conversion of food nitrates to 
nitrites occurs when foods are 
stored at room temperatures, but 
that this conversion is almost 
totally abolished when food is 
stored at 2° C (see fig. 1) The in-
creasing practice of refrigeration 
may thus explain the sharp drop in 
stomach cancer incidence in the 
West; this theory is also consistent 
with the higher incidence in lower 
socioeconomic ·groups. Japan has

Opening this Friday at 8:30 pm in 

long relied on the salting of fish as 
a substitute for its refrigeration. A 
negative correlation between 
gastric cancer rates and milk use 
which has been noted in Japan 
probably results from the fact that 
the milk used usually implies the 
availability of refrigeration. 

The distribution of secondary 
amines in foods is in the process of 
clarification; they are very widely 
distributed, and include some 
amino acids. 

An exciting preventative 
possibility has been raised by 
Mirvish (Science 177 (1972), 65 ) 
and others. It has been shown that 
ascorbic acid can prevent the 
spontaneous formation of 
nitrosamines from nitrites and 
secondary amines (see fig. 2). It 
has also been shown in animals 
that ascorbic acid can inhibit 
carcinogenesis resulting from the 
feeding of secondary amines with 
nitrites. This is consistent with the

containing fruits and vegetables 
have lesser tendencies to stomach 
cancer. 

If indeed nitrosamines are the 
major gastric carcinogens of most 
populations, as the evidence seems 
to indicate, then the use of 
adequate refrigeration, the ban-
ning of the unnecessary use of 
nitrates and nitrites as food ad-
ditives, and the practice oftaking a 
little ascorbic acid with each meal, 
might reduce stomach cancer 
incidence to a very low level. The 
regular ingestion of polycyclic 
hydrocarbons in smoked and 

broiled foods should be avoided as 
well, of course. 

Chicken Legs ... 
kicking its way into space, but with 
the proper technology the legs 
could be cosmetized to the point 
where it would appear like a scene 
from The Follies Bergere. Imagine 
a trip to the moon at the con-
veyance of a thousand groping 
thighs and calves. It was clearly 
too much for my eros-ridden 
imagination to contemplate. I 
switched back to the technological 
implications and knew they were 
fully as satisfying. Assuming fresh 
chicken legs at 60 cents per pound 
and declaring them good for at 
least 30 missions, the cost of a 
space flight would be available for 
chicken feed . 

Rosenbloom, too, knew victory 
was our for he had a thin smile on 
his still flushed face. He faced us 
and made a final announcement. 
" Now there remains only the 
testing before we can sta rt 
production." Swinson squirmed as 
Rosenbloom looked for an ex-
tension co!'e\.

What's In A Name? 
bear Boss, 

The point is, except for the players that particiPated in any particular 
intramural softball game, their mothers, and maybe Mike Hipp, no one 
really cares to read a story in this newspaper about last Saturday's ten 
o'clock contest on Muir Field. Or the one at five on Matthews. 

With twenty-plus leagues and 150 men, women, and coed teams, very 
few people could give a flying gurnard about a game or two. 

Player's names, scores, and standings are meaningless. And so what if 
Bernie Skiff hit three homeruns, or the Deleted turned over a fifth-inning 
triple play, or seventeen cases of beer were consumed in a Minor League. 
It still all comes out sounding like a you-had-to-be-there joke. 

But you weren't so, yawn, did I get a " Personal" in the classifieds this 
issue? 

So do something, you say. 
Well, perhaps the source of relevant 1M softball journalistic material is 

to be found in the names of the teams. Significant meaning of widespread 
interest could quite possibly be lurking somewhere within this collection 
of contrived titles. 

Analyses of these team names would certainly be revealing of 
something. These conscious innuendoes and double entendres are worttt a 
close look. Of course, names such as Fork You, The Black's Beach 
Grabbers, Bases Are Loaded, and Scripps, are so shallow and tasteless 
that they do not deserve any attention. 

But when you see names like Frottage, Qui Casca L'Asino, Head First, 
and Dik Short, you are forced to realize the potential for important in-
terpretative reporting. 

The most fruitful examinatiol)S wou1d probably be of a psychological 
nature. Even though difficult explorations into the subconscious would 
often be necessary, it is easy to see how much could be done with Wee 
Stink (poor diaper training), Dipsticks (autophilia), and Quick Release 
(reached puberty late) . 

And cryptically appealing laoels like Pelotudos, Milwaukee Tumor, 
Jok Jung, and Holes 'N Poles deserve special investigation. Because 
anyway, sir, what in fact is a Dodger? 

This, then, brings me to the new manner in which I feel that 1M softball 
games must be covered by the press if they wish to hold any journalistic 
consequence. Instead of reportil)g about only one or two trivial contests, 
and wasting twenty-five or thirty lines of space with dull, dry, tedious, 
and very uninteresting copy in the process, a list of headline-type results 
should be employed for a large number of ~vents. Not only would count-
less more games be included in an article,. but also in a much more 
readable and infonnative fashion. 

For instance:

ucsn To Host All-League 
Tournament This Weekend 

Spikers Sweep VCR In Final Triumph 
byRoDKato 
Staff Writer 

UC San Diego's volleyball team 
closed out their season last Friday 
night on a wirming note as they 
defeated UC Riverside in three 
straight games 1:),10, 1:),11 and 1:), 
6. 

With only a week till next 
Saturday's all-league tournament, 
the win came as a timely one for 
the Tritons who have not competed 
since the quarter break. "The 
players know they can do well and 
tonight had to help their. con-
fidence," said coach Jeff Gorrell 
looking ahead to the tournament. 

Playing without the services of 
their three regular setters John 
Lee, Stan Tamaki and Dave 
Rosenberg, the Tritons had to 
reshuffle their line-up to com-
pensate for the void. 

Unable to run their offense 
fluenUy in the early goings of the 
first game, UCSD fell behind by as 

Typifying the kind of night UCSD 
had at the service line, the Tritons' 
Greg Philips served the ball out of 
bounds to start off the second 
game. San Diego, which was 
unusually erratic with their serves, 
got some help from reserve Steve 
Adler who put his team ahead :),2. 
Riverside tied the at seven 

much as three points before tying Steve Simpson watches as 
the contest at 1(}'10. The Tritons Pete Gross completes a

and eight apiece and came within 
one point of the Tritons at 12-11, 
before yielding three straight 
points and the game. 

In the third and final contest, 
Riverside proved to be no match 
for the Tritons, who quickly pulled 
away on two four-point rallies. 
Wendell Birkhofer continued his 
spiking assault on UCR as he led 
his team to a 1~ win_ After the 
game, coach Gorrell went on the 
commend both Birkhofer and Bob 
Rhoades for their hitting per-
fonnance. 

With the absence of Tim Myrick, 
Pete Brown and the three setters, 
Gorrell substituted his reserves 
who had not seen much playing 
time this year. Given the o~ 
portunity to play, sophomore Bob 
Rowe played impressively in his 
brief appearance off the bench. 

Gorrell will conclude his four 
year coaching career for the 
Tritons in next Saturday's season 
tournament. The tourney, hosted 
by UCSD, will mark the return of 
such teams as Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo, Cal State Fullerton and UC 
Irvine. 

Tritons Now One Game Out 
by Dave Elsen 
Sports Editor 

The surprising UC San Diego 
baseball team won its third 
straight doubleheader, and now 

stands just one game out of first 
place in the NAiA District 3 
Southern Division. 

The Tritons swept Southern 
California College Saturday, 4-3 

Crew Victory For 
Triton Varsity 4 

" A much improved per-
fonnance" by the UC San Diego 
crew team resulted in a " satisfying 
win" for the Varsity" in the San 
Diego Invitational Saturday 
morning. 

According to Coach Jack 
Vallarga, the Varsity 4, composed 
of the stern four of tile Varsity 8, 
had a " nice, relaxed start," 
faltered a bit at the hallway point 
because of wakes created by a 
speed boat, and then steadily 

opened a lead over the last 800 
meters. 

With oarsmen Stan Reid, Tim 
Fellows, Mike Martin and Mark 
Lambert and coxswain Kirstie 
Tosh, the Varsity 4 won by seven 
seconds (about 1 112 boat lengths) 
over San Diego State, Club 
Espana, Santa Clara, Club de 
Marina and USC _ Vallarga 
credited coxswain Tosh for part of 
the victory, as she was able "to do 
a good job of steering" over a

In other races, the Varsity 8 

placed fourth behind USC, San 
Diego State, and Santa Clara. The 
Women's a garnered a third place 
finish and the Women's 4 placed 
fourth . 

and :),1, for its fifth and sixth wins 
in the last seven games. Tied with 
Point Loma for second place, 
UCSD hosts the Crusaders in a 
home doubleheader Saturday. 

Jeff Wiederholt and Bob 
Lofgren, for what seems to be the 
millionth time, pitched UCSD to 
the double-victory Saturday, and 
the pitchers have each won their 
last three decisions. 

In the first game against sec, 
first baseman Bob V aage slugged a 
tw()-run homer, and Dave 
Young dale singled home two mor . 
Wiederholt made the runs stand up 
until the seventh, when he loaded 
the bases with none out. 

Freshman Steve Robertson 
came in to relieve, and retired SCC 
without allowing a run, to gain the 
save. 

Lofgren scattered seven hits in 
the nine-inning nightcap, allowing 
just one unearned run. Carl 
Schlack, the Triton catcher, was 
the main offensive force, with a 
single, double and three runs 
batted in.

Energy Symposium. • • 
probably the most important 
point." There has been little ex-
perience in large power reactors 
and core plants have never been 
tested in situations of accident. 

Nuclear power, he said, should 
be regulated until this uncertainty 
is cleared up. 

Bethe believes that "as you shut 
down reactors, you do not learn to 
avoid accidents." He said the 
initiative would not improve 
safety, but "a moratorium, far 
from improving reactors, would 
make reactors less safe." 

Bethe added that only by en-
countering problems in an 
operating situation can they be 
solved. He said that if the initiative 
is passed industry will move away 
from nuclear power, increasing the 
energy shortage and lessening the 
safety ofthe plants. 

He emphasized that "nuclear 
energy, like any other energy, 
should not be examined in 
isolation." Oil imports are greater 
than domestic oil reserves, natural 
gas consumption is twice the new 
discoveries, solar energy is not 
developed economically, so two 
alternatives are possible : coal or 
nuclear power through fission. 

Coal, he said, is far more 
polluting. 

One in a Million 
Bethe said that for the one or two 

thousand cases of cancer caused 
by nuclear energy, there are seven 
thousand from natural causes and 
three thousand from diagnostic 
medicine. 

He supported the reliability of 
the Rasmussen report- criticized 
by Holdren- which placed the 
probability of a major plant break-
down at one in a million. 

O'Donnell began his presentation 
by saying, " the proposition is a 

Offensive ... 

shutdown law, not a safety law." 

According to him, the 
proposition imposes unmeetable 
conditions. He questioned the Issue 
of full compensation by asking how 
the court could define full com-
pensation and what should be 
compensated. 

He called the initiative a 'Catc~ 
22' law and said "it comprises a 
fraud on the California voters." 

Speaking on the economic im-
pact, O'DoMell said the bill would 
cost(California $15-25 million and 
create additional unemployment. 

Pesonen countered that "the fact 
that the industry opposes the 
proposition leads us to the con-
clusion of what meaning they at-
tach to it." 

Calling the industry "a rogue's 
gallery," Pesonen said that the 
labelling of the bill 'shutdown' was 
an admission that it was not viable 
in the society and that it is a 
strategy used to enforce fear into 
the public. 

He took a stand against the use of 
the Rasmussen report, saying 
insurance companies should be the 
guide to probability of accident. 

According to Pesonen, O'Don-
nell ' s citing of the 60 to 80 permits 
needed for a plant to be built was 
incorrect. He said that only two of 
the permits were not routine : the 
Public Utilities Commission and 
the Atomic Energy Commission 
meetings. He said the hearings' 
questions regarding safety 
measures were ruled irrelevant. 

Pesonen said the industry 
believes that public control of 
nuclear power by people affected is 
subversive of the industry.

of the report on unequal access to 
college by the staff of the Assembly 
Subcommittee on Post-se' Jndary 
Education and an analysis of the 
effectiveness of UC's current 
admissions procedures, he said. 

In connection with admissions, 
Schneider will be examining 
whether the entrance criteria of a 
3.1 GPA or college board scores of 
2750 really pro.vides for the ad-
mission of the top 12.5 per cent of 
the high school graduating c18ss. 

Schneider will also be preparing 
a critique of UC's annual report of 
the status of Mfirmative Action 
and reviewing the Student Affir-
mative Action Task Force report. 
He plans to "monitor and 
troubleshoot" problems in regional 
policy boards and individual 
campus proposals concerning 
affirmative action. 

As part of his plan to help spur 
legislators to fund Third College's 
Unit Two, Schneider said he has 
made appointments with members 
of the two legislative sub-com-
mittees that will deal with the UC 
budget, the Senate Finance sulr 
committee on Higher Education 
and the permanent Assembly 
subcommittee on Post-Secondary 
Education. 

Schneider is very optimistic on 
the possibilities of gaining the Unit 
Two funds. He said that Gov. 
Brown's philosophy of no new 
construction starts or expansion 
does not apply to the Unit Two 
complex. 

Schneider sees the exclusion of 
Unit Two funds as " a misun-
derstanding. The Governor has 
taken his stand in light of economic 
conditions ... But we have to make 
Gov. Brown and the legislators 
aware that Unit Two is the com-
pletion of one campus." 

Schneider stressed that 
legislators must be informed that 
Unit Two is necessary, not only to 
complete the Third complex, but to 
allow Fourth College to have its 
own buildings. 

The Senate higher education 
subcommittee is meeting 
tomorrow afternoon to consider 
Unit Two funding , in what 
Schneider considers to be the 
crucial hurdle in the legislative 
process to gain the necessary 
funds .

~ overthrow the government of 
President Juan Maria Bordaberry. 

Amnesty International ha s 
claimed that at least 24 people 
have died in prison because of 

" torture. The group is trying to 
force the Uruguayan government 
,~ to allow an international 

delegation to investigate political 
prisoners in a manner similar to 
the investigation of political 
prisoners made in Chile two years 
ago. 

Engel said the Uruguayan 
s ituation will be handled in the 
same manner as other countries. 
Members will write to judges, 
legislators and other goverrunental 
officials and try to force a public 
debate in the international arena 
about the problem . 

However, Engel stated that in 
many countries this sort of 
pressure sirtlply does not work. 
" There will be times when 
Amnesty International will not be 
effective," Engel said. 

The campus chapter will have a 
membership meeting this Wed-
nesday at 4 pm at the student 
center.
