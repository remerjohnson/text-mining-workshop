Students Rally for O.A.S.I.S Funding 
Students seek definite and 
increased money for Summer 
Bridge and other programs 
By VINCENT GUGNANI 
News EdItor 

Dozens of students demonstrated on 
Library Walk yesterday, calling for 
increased, perm nent funding of O.A.S.I.S. 
and the Summer Bridge programs. 

"We want to make sure that the funding 
will be there for the next 10 years, for the lit-
tle kids that are walking around campus tak-
ing tours: said Natalie Davis, former chair 
of the Student Affirmative Action 
Committee. 

Last fall, Chancellor Dynes's Diversity 
Council recommended that he replace the 
$400,000 in temporary O.A.S.I.S. and 
Summer Bridge funding with permanent 
funds. It also called for an additional 
$70,000 in O.A.S.I.S. funding. 

Summer Bridge is run through the 
O.A.S.l.S office and is designed to offer 
incoming freshmen the tools to succeed at 
UCSD. The program allows students to earn 
five units of college credit by taking a con-
temporary issu4!s course, as well as math or 
science enrichment activity. 

Joseph Watson, vice chancellor of stu-
dent affairs, said he is dedicated to main-
taining O.A.S.I.S. and Summer Bridge fund-
ing. 

"I have indicated that it is an ongoing 
commitment: he said. "I would cut other 
programs before cutting SumlT!er Bridge: 

Watson said he would also consider 
increasing O.A.S.I.S. funding if money is 
available to do so.

Wienhausen Chosen 
as Founding Provost 
Biology professor named to head the 'art, 
culture, and technology' themed Sixth College 

Sf"" Writer 
Gabriele Wtenhausen~kssor 

of biology, will be offi' named 
founding provost of UCS 's sixth 
college in July. The college is 
expcct£d to open in fall 2002. 

Wienhausen came to UCSD 
in 1981 to do biomedical research 
in metabolic adaptions to envi-
ronmental stress. She is currently 
the vice chair for education in 
biology, a member of the biology 
department and chair of the 
Academic Senate Committee on 
Educational Policy. 

During her time at UCSD, 
Wtenhausen received six teaching 
awards. including the 2000 
Chancellor's Associates 
Outstanding Teaching Award. She 
also co-directed the multimedia 
interactive learning lab and is rcc-

ognized for her creation of tech-
nological instructional materials. 

The selection committee was 
headed by David Miller, associate 
vice chancellor of academic 
affairs, and consisted of members 
representing several departments. 

Although Wienhausen was 
chosen for her background in 
technology and its' correlation 
with the theme of the new college, 
which is "art, culture and tech-
nology,w Wienhausen believes she 
was chosen for broader reaSons. 

"I'm the current vice chair of 
education in the biology depart-
ment, which is the department 
with the single Illl'gest major on 
campus,w she said. "We have 
3,600 biology majors, so that has

Union Approves First 
Ever Labor Contract 
Plan approved to provide teaching assistants 
with raises, improved conditions and benefits 
News Editor 

Teaching assistant . union 
members across the UC system 
voted by a 93-percent margin last 
week to approve their first labor 
contract with the university. 

The new contract, which cov-
ers approximately 10,000 TAs, 
includes pay raises for all TAs, 
increased tuition rebates and full 
health care coverage. 

The contract also provides for 
a grievance procedure and bind-
ing third-party arbitration . 

"Academic student ,employees 
at the University of California 
fought for 16 years to win the 
right to collective bargaining,W 
said Kristen Guzman, a chicano 
studies TA at UCLA. "This con-
tract shows exactly what we have 
been fighting for: better wages, 

improved working conditions and 
fairness on all campuses: 

Brad Hayward, a spokesman 
for the university, said he expects 
the university to ratify the con-
tract before the end of this 
month. 

The contract includes an 
almost 10-percent salary raise for 
TAs, consisting of an immediate 
I .S-percent salary range adjust-
ment in addition to the 2-percent 
increase provided in October 
1999. Range adjustments will fol -
low in October 2000, 2001 and 
2002, and are anticipated to be 2 
percent each, depending on state 
allocations. 

The university, which now 
provides 60-percent remission of 
mandatory systemwide student 
fees for eligible graduate TAs. will

Protest: 
A.S. Council supports 
increased funding 
C ....... dfreM ..... l 
items," he said. 

Davis said the demonstration 
was meant to draw attention to the 
issue of O.A.S.I.S. funding . 

"We want to go and actually taUt 
to our chancdlor; she said. "We're 
not here to knock him, wc're here to 
support him as chid diversity officer." 

Davis contrasted the temporary 
funding given to O.A.S.I.S with the 
$3.15 million that the university 
gave to athletics last quarter. 

"It's not that we don't support 
athletics, but athletics alone will 
not create a campus climate that 
will support everybody; Davis said . 

Jessica Lopez, chair of the 
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano/a 
de AztJan, said O.A.S.I.S. funding 
needs to be one of the chancellor's 

Provost: 
Wtenhausen will create 
rurriru.lum w fit theme 
mately. the size of a normal college. 
The issues and problems are differ-
ent, but I have a lot of academic 
administrative experience." 

As provost, Wienhausen said 
her first task will be to work with a 
committee to create a curriculum 
that fits the college's theme. 

"The theme is. of course, I think 
really very exciting and really 
requires us to think about the di(-
ferent disciplines that are named in 
the title and to find the commonali-
ties, how are they connected; 
Wienhausen said. "I feel very 
strongly that they are conneaed and 
very often we don't see it. If you're in 

main priorities. 
"Since it's the sole learning cen-

ta' on campus for everyone. and he 
is the chid diversity officer, it should 
be of uunost importance. and if not, 
then he should not be the chid 
diversity officer," Lopez said. 

Members of the A.S. Council 
also attended the rally. Last 
February, the council passed a res-
olution stating that the partial 
funding of O.A.S.I.S. on a tempo-
rary basis contradicts UCSD's mes-
sage that diversity is a priority. 

Eugene Mahmoud, A.S. vice 
president external, said it is a dis-
service to all students that Dynes 
has not taken the advice of his own 
diversity council and the A.S. 
Council. 

Mahmoud also said O.A.S.I.S 
tutoring gave him the ability to suc-
ceed in classes of 200 to 300 stu-
dents. He said that 5O-person wait 
lists make it difficult for O.A.5.I.S. to 
continu~ ~upponing ~ents with-
out receIVIng more fundmg. 

the sciences, ~u don't see the other 
world, and vice versa." 

Marsha Chandler, vice<hancellor 
of academic affairs, said 
Wienhausen's appoinunent is a mar-
vdous ~nning for the new college. 

"Gabnele is a natural for this 
position, given her strong dedication 
to undergraduate extensive adminis-
trative experience; she said. "Her 
groundbreaking work in innovative 
teaching methods and instructional 
technology is a perfect fit with the 
theme of the Sixth College." 

Wienhausen has extensive expe-
rience with educational technology. 
She says she plans to incorporate 
online classes and learning into the 
general education of the sixth col-
lege in an effort to maximize both 
teachers' and students' efforts. 

"I think the new media allows us 
to express ourselves in a different 
way; she said. "I think it might also 

The UCSD Guardian 

"It is disgraceful that the chancel-
lor has named himself chid diversity 
officer while refusing to support 
O.A.S.I.S. with permanent funding 
and the funding it needs." he said. 

Mahmoud added that he will 
use the resources of the A.S. exter-
nal office to support the cause of 
increased, permanent O.A.S.l.S and 
Summer Bridge funding. 

Watson said that while he was 
pleased that ;,udents are voicing 
their concerns, he did not feel that 
such a demonstration was necessary. 

"It's been constantly stated that 
funds are not in jeopardy; he said. 
"I don't see why they are demon-
strating when this has been com-
municated." 

Tamara Webster, SAAC chair-
elect, said students will continue to 
fight to support O.A.S.l.S. until 
their goals are realized. 

"This is not going to be the 
end; she said. "We are going to say 
something again. We are not going 
to let this die." 

allow us to access information in a 
different way. I really do believe that 
digital information technology will 
become a part of our education." 

She added that technology will 
change education. 

"I'm not saying that our educa-
tion will become a virtual education, 
I'm not proposing that at all; she 
said. "I just think that digital, online 
learning will become a part of the 
way we interaa with each other ... It 
will allow us to tree up faculty time 
for student-faculty interaction in a 
very new and creative way." 

Although she will have to drop 
some of her engagements, such as 
serving as vice chair for education 
in biology, Wienhausen said she 
will still teach . 

"I will continue to teach or other-
wise I will die." she said. "I would 
lose touch with the people I am serv-
ing if [ didn't. How could I do that?"

Colleges Vulnerable 
to Donor Blackmail 

Like a parent punishing a child for not 
~beying orders, Nike recently withdrew mil-
lto~s o~ dollars in sponsorship from the 
Unlve~lty ~f Or'!g~n, .Brown University and 
t?e Un~verslty of MichJgan after the universi-
ties sl~ned onto the . Worker Rights 
Cons~rtlu':1 ' The WRC, whl(,h the University 
of Caltforma recently joined, makes sure that 
cl?thing bearing universities' logos complies 
with cod~ of conducts by not being manu-
factured In sweatshop conditions. 

ik~'s d~cision most dramatically affects 
the UmversIt~ of ~rego~, which has enjoyed 
a close relatJonship with ike CEO Phil 
Knight until now. Before Nike withdrew its 
support, the company had promised to 
donate $30 million toward the renovation of 
Oregon's football stadium. 

Knight is peeved at Oregon for signing 
Onto the WRC because he believes the mon-
itoring group, run by students, labor leaders 
and human rights groups, is really just a front 
for the AFL-CIO and UN.LT.E. unions 
wh~ch want to bring apparel jobs back to th~ 

UnIt~d States. In actuality, while the AFL-
CIC? IS on the ~C's governing board and its 
advls.ory councli, the organization receives no 
fundLng directly or indirectly from the union. 

Knight'~ allegations of WRC corruption 
are really Just a delaying tactic. He realizes 
that the corporate-sponsored Fair Labor 
Associat!on is a sinking ship and just wants 
to buy time. The FLA, which consists of a 
conglomerate of companies, consumer 
groups and universities, came into being in 
March 1999 and has not done anything 

oth~r than issue meaningless press releases 
dunng its short life. 

In addition, the FLA's code of conduct _ 
adopted by all companies and universities 

that have signed ~p with the group - does 
not g? far enough 10 demanding fair business 
practices abroad. The code fails to establish a 
credible method of monitoring factories and 
falls short when it comes to demanding living 
wag~s and fair treatment of female workers. 

Given all this, it is no wonder student 
activists have rejected the FLA and given their 
support to the WRC. The WRC is the organi-
zation of th~ futu,re, and no amount of pres-
sure from Ntke Will change this. Knight needs 
to .accept the FLA's incompetence and to stop 
usmg scare tactics to get what he wants. 
Withdrawing SUPP?rt ~or the University of 
Oreg~n, ~rown Umverslty and the University 
of Michigan was a petty act, one which, 
unfortunatelJJ points to a potential problem 
for all universities. 
. . Although the University of California 
J~Ined the ~C without facing any repercus-

most prominently Qualcomm. As a result'

If a major backer decided he or she did not

The Guardian recommends that UCSD 
enact ~ safety policy in case this unfortullale

University of Oregon example and make sure 
t~at UCSD does not become the next univer-
Sity hurt by a vanishing donation.

UCSD's Policies on Academic Dishonesty 
Are Often Neglected by Professors 
Students are usually not informed of what exactly constitutes cheating at UCSD 
and as a result some manage to slip through the cracks and get away with murder 
., P~A UiIUIAN A ... .1_ has . 
Staff Writ., S,,"-'Cnt someone groe 

What is cheating? The New 
International Webster's Pocket 
~ictionary de~nes cheating as Mdeceiv-
~n~ .or defra~dl~g,W but how is this def-
mltlon apphed 10 real-life situations? 

A close look at the UCSD Student 
Cond~ct and Discipline Code reveals 
there IS no clear-cut, black-and-white 
definition of cheating. According to 
~onduct Code 22.14.10.10. the univer-
sity considers Mall forms of academic 
misconduct, including but not limited 
to, .c.hea.ting, fabrication, plagiarism or 
faclhtaung academic dishonestyw 
grounds for diScipline. 

This a~bigu~us policy leaves room 
for cheatmg. Smce the term is not 
clearly defined, any actions of dishon-
esty are left up to the eye of the behold-
er. 

Another obvious problem arises 
when . analyzing the UCSD Policy on 
Integrtty of Scholarship, which stipu-
lates: MAli academic work will be done 
by the student to whom it is assigned 
without unauthorized aid of any lC.ind~ 
and mst~cto~ . Mmust clearly inform 
students 10 writing what kinds of aid 
and collaboration, if any, are permitted 
on graded assignments.w However, not 
all professors specify what is and is not 
acceptable or what can and cannot be 
used to accomplish assignments. 

In my last three writing-oriented 
cI~sses, not once did my professors 
stipulate any conditions or restrictions 
concerning "aid or collaboration." The 
professor just handed out the topics 
and assumed the students knew what 
was acceptable and unacceptable. 

Though it may seem unnecessary to 
r~state what might be assumed as a 
given - that the students would know 
what academic dishonesty is - the pro-
fessors must adhere to the policy and 

him or her so much help on a 
paper that every single line has 
been revised and changed. A 
student turns in the final 
product which is not the sale 
effort of that person, but rather 
the product of an intensive 
collaboration. The ideas and 
words no longer resemble those 
of the Drigi'Tlt4 that would be a 
form of cheating. The drive for 
good grades influenced students 
so much that the end resul~ the 
well-written paper, justifies the 
means in which the academic 
scholarship by that student is 
/nst. 
state ~he conditions in order to prevent 
cheating. Something left unsaid leaves 
room .for loopholes and abuse, and it 
essenually concedes everything as fair 

. game. 
Here are two shady situations. A stu-

dent has someone give him or her so 
'!1uch help on a paper that every single 
hne has bee.n revised and changed. A stu-
dent turns 10 the tinal product which is 
not the sole effort of that person, but 
rather the product of an intensive collab-
oration. If the ideas and words no longer 
resemble those of the original, that 
would be a. form of cheating. 

The drtve for good grades innu-
enced students so much that the end 
result, the w~II-writ.ten paper, justifies 
the means 10 which the academic 

scholarship by that student is lost. 
If a student relies solely on himself 

or herself rec~ives a. C, whereas the per-
son wh~ ~ecelved hne-by-line addition 
and revIsion help receives an A, this 
would ~ considered an unfair practice 
that sholJld be prevented by their pro-
fessors. I am aware that many students 
take advantage of these lax policies in 
su~h a manner .in ~rder ~o get easy A's 
while the few with mtegnty still stid it 
out all alone end up with C's and 8's. 

Thoug.h . this for~ of cheating is 
rampant, It IS almost Impossible to pre-
vent because there are no apparent 
safeguards in place to do so. Also, the 

ab~nce of blind implementation of the 
pohcy of requiring all professors to give 
the students the rules for their assign-
ments opens up the field for academic 
dishonesty. 

Even when the. policy is crystal clear 
on what IS conSidered cheating, this 
policy is not enforced across the board

In another humanities final with the 
same class size, this enforcement stan-
dard was not used. In this final, a large

asked questions and shared answers 
during the exam. When the friends told

Front Sight Misfires' in Effort to Affirm Rigllts of Gun Users 
Pro-gun activists are rallying behind Front Sight, Nev., a gun-friendly town that has many firearm opponents up in arms 
DBlly Bruin (UCLA) 

(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES -
The issue of gun control has arisen 
once again. With the Million Mom 
March taking place this past 
Mother's Day, the line was drawn 
for a nationwide debate. Those in 
favor of gun control finally had 
something to rally behind. The 
demonstration that took place in 
more than 60 cities showed 
Congress the power of a grass-
roots anti-gun movement. What 
are the gun supporters rallying 
behind? The answer is Front Sight, 
Nev. 

While the Million Mom March 
protested in favor of trigger locks, a 
national gun registration and 
licensing program, and mandatory 
training classes, gun-rights sup-
porters are eagerly anticipating the 
creation of a city that is more 
demented than Irvine, and in an 
entirely different way. 

Front Sight, Nev., is located 48 
mites west of Las Vegas and is 
being billed as the nation's first 
"gun resort city: According to the 
April 18 issue of USA Today, when 
this resort is finished, it will come 
complete with 12 shooting ranges, 
an assault tower, 400 yards of train-
ing tunnels, 177 home lots, a con-
venience store and a private K-12 
school. Well, ifthere wasn't a better 
place for me to take my family. 

You know, some might think 
Disneyland would be a better place 
for a family outing, but Ignatius 
Piazza, the city's founder, calls 
Front Sight Ma Disneyland or a 

Pebble Beach forlthe nation's 80 
million gun owners.w ~ure it is like 
Disneyland. Maybe if Goofy guard-
ed It's a Small World with an Uzi. 

I cannot believe after all that has 
happened in the past year, people 
would actually believe a place such 
as Front Sight is an ideal family 
environment. From Columbine to 
the Granada Hills Jewish 
Community Center, how many 
children have to have a gun point-
ed at them before suicter laws are 
enacted? I would not want to imag-
ine what would happen if a shoot-
ing broke out at the school in Front 
Sight. Think about the melee of 
random gunfire that would ensue 
after the first shot was tired. 

Personally, the very thought of 
the words "gunW and Mschool w in 
the same sentence make me sick to 
my stomach, but ~ guess other peo-
ple feel differently. Chris Fisher, 
who recently purchased a home in 
Front Sight and likes to take his 
10-year-old son target shooting, 
said, "It's a sport, no different than 
a father-son golf tandem: 

He is right; it is no different -
except for the fact that if you shank 
your drive someone probably will 
not die. When was the last time a 
missed four-foot putt had the same 
result as an errant gun shot? 

Front Sight is cleverly named 
after the part of the gun barrel that 
is used for aiming. With this in 
mind, I really hope Nevada starts 
creating towns surrounding Front 
Sight. I hope it names them after all 
the children who have died as a 
result of gunshot wounds in order 
to constantly remind the people 

All I /mow is that the 
house in Westwood that I 
live in was shot at 
recentry: Whether or not I 
uumed a gun would have 
had no bearing on the fact 
that two shotgun blasts 
were fired through our 
front windows. When I 
stop and think about that 
moment, it becomes clear 
that I would rather have 
Congress pass a law to 
keep the guy driving by 
from not having a gun 
than to own a gun myself 
who live in Front Sight of the dam-
age they could potentially cause. 

Of course, guns do not kill peo-
ple. People kill people. At a Web site 
titled MJustin's Pro Gun Page W 
(www.shadt.1e12 .pa .us/studtnts/ 
justinlprogun.html), Justin argues 
this point by saying that "Guns are 
tools, just like knives, hammers, 
screwdrivers, paintbrushes, etc. W 
Yeah, guns are tools. However, 
knives. hammers, screwdrivers and 
paintbrushes all serve purposes 
other than killing. What purpose 
does a gun serve other than taking 
some form of life? 

Justin follows ">' asking, Mlf a

few thousand people [are] killed 
with cars, should we start to heavi-
ly regulate automobile sales, own-
ership and operation?" 

I wonder if Justin remembers a 
little movement that started in the 
1980s called Mothers Against 
Drunk Driving. The issue of guns 
is no different than that of cars. 
MADD forced Congress to look 
not at the car, but at who was dri-
ving it. This is what the govern-
ment has to do with guns. Who 
should not be using them? 
Criminals and children. The gun 
locks and registration and licens-
ing procedures that gun control 
advocates are in favor of would 
make sure of that. 

Strangely enough, it is the peo-
ple whom gun control advocates 
are not worried about that do the 
most protesting. If you really want-
ed to use your gun for target prac-
tice and teach your son how to use 
it, what would be wrong with regis-
tering and licensing your weapon? 
Chances are, if these are your rea-
sons and you are still against these 
regulations, you are hiding some-
thing. 

Don't tell me it is your consti-
tutional right. The Second 
Amendment was enacted in the 
day of the musket. If everyone 
wants to carry a weapon that takes 
three minutes to reload after every 
shot, then carry all the weapons 
you want. [will have plenty of time 
to run away if someone misses. 
Don't just ask me to trust that 
someone who can get his hands 
on an assault weapon will be 
trained in how to use it, or be 

rational enough to know not to 
use it. 

The visionaries of Front Sight 
are calling it "the safest town in 
America" because they believe they 
will not have any crime if everyone 
is trained in firearms and almost 
everyone owns them. How asinine 
do you really have to be to believe 
that if everyone owned guns, then 
there would be no violence? 

All [ know is that the house in 
Westwood that I live in was shot at 
recently. Whether or not I owned a 
gun would have had no bearing on 
the fact that two shotgun blasts 
were fired through our front win-
dows. When I StOP and think about 
that moment, it becomes clear that 
I would rather have Congress pass 
a law to keep the guy driving by 
from not having a gun than to own 
a gun myself. 

If you disagree, then by all 
means move to Front Sight. Get as 
far away from me as possible. In 
fact, Front Sight residents are hav-
ing a special right now, called their 
Platinum Membership. [t includes 
unlimited use of the shooting 
ranges, free gun cleaning, a leather 
holster and a heavy silver card to 
carry in your coat pocket. So when 
you all want to relive your Wyatt 
Earp fantasies, the weighted coat 
swings back further so you can 
draw your weapon. 

The kicker for me, thou$h, is if 
you make your payment In full , 
Front Sight will throw in a free Uzi.

The Status of All-Campus Commencement Should Not Hinge on the Speaker 
Editor: 
As a graduating senior, last 

week's cancellation of the all-
campus commencement was a 
great disappointment for me. Like 
many of my classmates, I have rel-
atives who bought nonrefundable 
plane tickets to come to the cere-
mony. I was also looking forward 
to singing at my own graduation 
in the gospel choir. 

Aside from my disappoint-
ment, [ feel that the administra-
tion has failed me by canceling 
the ceremony. Angelou's cancella-
tion is hardly sufficient reason to 
call off the entire graduation cere-
mony for myself and my class-
mates .. A?1 I wrong in suspecting 
that this indicates that the univer-
sity places importance on the 
commencement not to honor the 
accomplishments of my c1as~­
mates and me, but rather to add 
another famous speaker to its 
prestigious list? Since when is the 
fame or "suitability" of the speak-
er the only reason for having a 
commencement ceremony? Are 
the graduates not important in 
the equation? 

!JCSO. is probab!y the only 
major university of Its size and 
reputation that would cancel its 
all-campus commencement, and 
it can do so only because of its 

back-up plan. The A.S. president 
made an attempt to avoid cancel-
lation by presenting the names of 
five possible replacements to the 
administration .. This plan was 
rejected for reasons that are not 
entirely clear to me. In any case, 
UCSO is a first-rate institution; 
Nobel laureates, famous poets, 
writers and excellent scientists are 
all professors at or are associated 
with the university. Surely there is 
someone among this remarkable 
group of people who would be 
willing to send us to the world 
with their parting words of wis-
dom. 

However, it seems there is 
great contentment, even eager-
ness, to rely only on the individual 
college commencement cere-
monies. This move is counter to 
the philosophy that UCSO's col-
lege system is based on. The col-
lege system is intended to make 
th~ exp~rience of attending a large 
uOlverslty more personal and less 
like that of a meaningless number. 
It is not a back-up plan for the 
times when the campuswide func-
tions fail. 

[ am loyal to Revelle college 
and will be proud to graduate 
with my Revelle classmates.

ArtIcle on News lit 
....... ontheNoee 

Editor: 
I found Simone Santini's ani-

cle ("Market Pressures Force 
News to be Entertaining Rather 
Than Informative: April 18) par-
ticularly interesting and useful. 
Having almost stopped reading 
The UCSD Guardian years ago 
because of the large proportion of 
narrow-minded, reactionary or 
just plain stupid articles I used to 
find in it, I was pleasantly sur-
prised to read this one. 

As a foreigner living in the 
United States, while I recognize 
that this country has some won-
derful things to offer, I am often 
struck and appalled by the gener-
al apathy and profound lack of 
interest in international issues -
and more generally in public 
affairs or even community issues 
- displayed by a majority of 
American people, as well as by the 

complacency with which most of 
the American media condones 
and reinforces this apathy and 
lack of interest. Since, because of 
the enormous power of the 
United States, decisions made by 
U.S. leaders in the name of the 
American people often affect peo-
ple all over the world in signifi-
cant or even vital ways, it seems to 
me that it is part of the responsi-
bilities of American citizens to -
at a minimum - keep themselves 
aware of the issues involved, so 
that they can make informed deci-
sions when exercising their right 
to vote. 

I think that the elements 
Santini analyzed are part of a 
global. though United States-led. 
movement toward a world in 
which nothing else will exist but 
an ali-encompaSSing 'marketplace, 
and that already we all are, rather 
than citizens or members of com-
munity, increasingly reduced to 
the status of mere participants in 
that marketplace, as consumers, 
and - ultimately - as commodi-
ties ourselves. 

We should not be embracing 
this.

Dishonesty: 
Lax enforcement has 
allowed students to cheat 
ellLll .............. 
caught. They had not been 
warned. No one enforced the pol-
icy that an examination complet-
ed even »in partW by another per_ 
son through givin~ of ideas is 
indeed cheating. This inconsistent 
enforcement of the policy leads to 
an unequal field for academic 
schOlarship to be pursued. 

Obviously there is already a 
breakdown between the intended 
goals of the policy and the actual 
implementation o( these policies by 
the faculty. The university has been 
lax in its responsibility to enforce its 
academic policies. As the UCSO 
Policy on Integrity of Scholarship 
states. the university accepts that 
"the responsibility for maintaining 
the standards of academic honesty 
rests with two university authorities: 
the faculty and the administration." 

By the examples provided and 
those left still undetected, it is 
clear that the university must do a 
better job of providing an envi-
ronment in which a student does 
not have to cheat in order to sur-
vive and get good grades. Though 
a code of honor rests upon the 
students to not cheat and to 
maintain academic honesty, just 
as in society there is crime, so too 
on our campus there are always 
people who will take the easy way 
to make the grades and to get into 
the real world. 

It is incumbent upon the facul-
ty and administration to enforce 
the existing policies resolutely 

. and create unambiguous polices 
that clearly define and prevent 
cheating so that a level playing 
field for the pursuit of academic 
scholarship on this university is 
maintained.

'Perfect Egg' Should Not Be On The Auction Block 
Web site that auctions off the eggs of beautiful women 'is a disturbing reminder of the shallow vanity of our society 
Daily Bruin (UCLA) 

(U-W1RE) LOS ANGELES -
What are the criteria for a perfect 
child? If you could create your ideal 
son or daughter, would she have 
blue C)'Cs and blonde hair? Would 
he have amazing basketball skills 
and get a 1600 on his SAT? 
According to ads asking for egg 
donors in college newspapers 
everywhere, "Preferred Donors will 
meet the following Criteria: Height 
Approximately 5'6" or Taller, 
Caucasian, Blue Eyes, SAT Score 
around 1300, Extra compensation 
available for someone who might 
be especially gifted in athletics, sci-
ence/mathematies or music." 

We may pass by these ads with-
out paying them much attention. 
Silently, though, they embody the 
superficiality that plagues our soci-
ety, and they send us the message 
that outer beauty is everything. 

Before last year, fertility clinies 
or egg broker businesses paid egg 
donors between $2,500 and $5,000 
for eggs to give to couples who 
could not have their own child the 
opponunity to have children. 
However, on Oct. 25, 1999, Ron 
Harris changed the egg trade into 
big business. With his Web site, 
"Ron's Angels; Hams created a 
market for selling the eggs of beau-
tiful women. Now, ads offer up to 
$150,000 for the perfect egg. 

Who is Ron Harris? Before 
manning his successful Web site, 
Harris was a photographer in the 
porn industry and a film director 
for the Playboy Channel. His back- • 
ground may seem irrelevant, but it 
underscores the obsession with 
looks that such ads exude. 

As Harris himself remarks on 

his site, "I know what I'm saying 
about beauty, it's what's already 

g~ing on. in the culture. This .site 
SImply mirrors our current SOCIety, 
in that beauty usually goes to the 
highest bidder." Harris reminds us 
that if we wish to get plastic surgery 
or fake breasts to become more 
"beautiful,W it's all about the 
money. While these decisions are 
none of my business. when it.shifts 
to formulating your own beautiful 
child, I think we have to draw the 
line. 

Harris may contend that he is 
simply going with the flow of soci-
ety, but his backward philosophies 
attempt to dictate our values and 
objectify women and children. 

"Those things that are wanted 
most are beautiful women, beauti-
ful children, fine an, real estate, 

. gold, money and power. All these 
objects are stable and create stabili-
ty in your life and help to guarantee 
the success of your genes. to get 
your genes to the next generation 
and beyond," Harris writes. It is this 
twisting of Darwin's ideas that the 
Nazis used to justify their racist 
practices. 

Not only does Harris succeed in 
equating women and children with 
objects, but by including beautiful 
women as a means to create stabili-
ty and guarantee the success of 
one's genes, he alludes to the fact 
that men are the only ones passing 
on their genes to the next genera-
tion. It may seem that his ideas are 
so farfetched that they are not even 
wonh mentioning. Look at Los 
Angeles. and you will see many 
people who buy into the idea that 
beauty and material wealth are 
everything. Harris' ideas, along with 
ads asking for the perfect egg 
donors, contribute to the notion 

Many advances in 
technology have helped us 
immensely. The ability 
for infertile couples to 
have children is no 
exception. M run into 
dangerous territory when 
such advancements begin 
to mirror the negative 
side of our society and no 
one speaks up. 
that value lies only in superficial 
beauty. 

Harris Web site pictures consist 
of beautiful women hoping to sell 
their eggs for hundreds of thou-
sands of dollars. As Rob Dreher, 
columnist for the Ntw Ycri Post 
remarks. »We are fast approaching 
the point where the poor, the sick 
and the unbeautiful will be thought 
of as enemies. " 

What ads such as these tell us is 
that our worth depends on our 
beauty, and that beauty lies in being 
tall, blonde and blue-eyed. Some 
may argue that parents are simply 
aiming to create a child that most 
nearly reflects their own character-
istics. However, considering the 
majority of ads ask for these same 
white f'catures, it becomes evident 
that those able to spend the money 
to get such model eggs are them-
selves blonde and blue-eyed. So, 
along with the Jaguar and the 
designer Prada bag. it is now possi-
ble to get the top-of-the-Iine baby 
to match. Nothtng but the best, 
right? 

We must examine what it says 

about our society that those who 
can afford it wish to have kids with 
these cenain physical features. I 
agree that parents should be able to 
find an egg donor whose character-
istics match theirs, yet I am afraid 
we will fall into a pattern where only 
the rich are able to create the 
healthiest, sma nest babies. 

With the skyrocketing price that 
people are willing to pay for eggs, 
what happens to the low-income or 
even middle-class couples hoping 
to have a child? Obviously, they can 
continue to have children that turn 
out fine by paying less. Thus, there 
exists no reason for the "perfect" 
egg business that has arisen . In 
addition, what happens to the 
thousands of children waiting to be 
adopted everyday? 

With the ability to buy the per-
fect egg. many parents who would 
previously have turned to adoption 
will instead vie to create the ideal 
child. This only contributes to the 
notion that orphans who may have 
some problems or may simply not 
look exactly like their parents are 
not wonh raising or loving. It takes 
a lot of commitment and love to 
adopt a child. Such ads, however, 
discourage adoption by suggesting 
that one must have a beautiful, 
unblemished child in order to love 
him or her. 

While such advertisements may 
seem hannless, they add to the 
bombardment of image of blonde 
and white as beautiful. I am not say-
ing this is not beautiful. What if I 
have dark skin and black eyes? Or 
freckles and red hair? Am I worth 
any less? On Harris' Web site, while 
the minimum bid (yes, they auction 
them off) for a brown-eyed woman 
is $15,000, for a blonde egg it 
jumps to $90,000. These ads 

uphold the idea that there exists a 
certain standard of beauty. 
Anything different from this stan-
dard does not appear to be worth as 
much. 

Not only are cenain physical 
features praised as beautiful, but 
since when did physical appearance 
become our first priority in having 
kids anyway? Call me crazy, but I 
always thought the point of having 
a child was to raise and love anoth-
er human being, no matter what he 
or she look like or what SAT score 
he or she might get. 

In addition, a "model" egg does 
not guarantee a beautiful child. 
What if the child turns out to have 
brown eyes or is not as athletic as 
promised? Will he be loved any 
less? Unless we are ready to love a 
child unconditionally, we should 
not be having one in the first place. 

Many advances in technology 
have helped us immensely. The 
ability for infertile couples to have 
children is no exception. We run 
into dangerous territory when such 
advancements begin to mirror the 
negative side of our society and no 
one speaks up. I am not saying thal 
advertisements offering up to 
$150,000 for the perfect egg are the " 
worst thing ever to happen and that 
we must all boycott the newspapers 
that run them. I am saying that to 
remain silent while superficiality ts 
encouraged and beauty is bought 
for thousands of dollars is sad. It is 
sad beca use we can do better. 

By becoming aware and doing 
our part to send the message thai 
appearance is not everything, we 
can rise above these tendencies and 
let those with brown hair or 900 
SAT scores or no athletic skills 
know that they are okay, and just as 
worthy of love as anyone else.

Russia Threatens to Bomb T_gets in Afghanistan 

MOSCOW - Russia warned 
on Wednesday that it might bomb 
targets in Afghanistan if the 
Islamic-led government there 
shelters and supports rtbels fight-
ing in Chechnya and former 
Soviet republics in Central Asia. 

The Russian foreign minister 
and defense minister each sug-
gested that airstrikes might be car-
ried out if the Taliban, the funda -
mentalist group that leads the 
Afghan government, supports 
Islamic militants fighting in the 
former Soviet Union. 

"If a potential threat emerges, 
various actions become possible," 
Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov 

said when asked if Russia was con-
templating airstrikes. 

There wert no signs that mili-
tary action was imminent, and 
some experts said that the 
Russians wert engaging in saber 
ranling to press the 'taliban to 
sever its linlts with Islamic mili -
tants in the former Soviet Union. 

Russian officials also insisted 
that the Kremlin was not planning 
a ground attack in Afghanistan, 
the site of a disastrous 1 O-year war 
between Soviet troops and Islamic 
guerrillas. 

Still, the Russian threat put the 
United States in an uncomfortable 
position little more than a week 

before a summit meeting hert 
between President Clinton and 
Russian President Vladimir Putin. 

Washington has urged the 
Kremlin not to broaden the con-
nict in the Caucasus or along its 
southern periphery by bombing 
Afghanistan . Still, it was the 
Clinton administration that 
launched a cruise missile attack in 
1 998 against suspected terrorist 
camps in Afghanistan following 
the bombings of U.S. embassies in 
Kenya and Tanzania. 

Furthermort, the object of the 
Clinton administration 's attack -
the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, 
whom Washington suspects of 

masterminding the embassy 
bombings - is also a nemesis of 
Russia. Russian officials have 
charged that bin Laden and 
Islamic groups are providing 
weapons and other aid to Chechen 
rebels. 

U.S. experts say that thert is 
some merit to the Russian com-
plaint that the fighters in 
Chechnya include militants from 
the Middle East and South Asia 
and that foreign Islamic groups 
are providing money and material 
support.

Death of Student Prompts Protests at University 
BEUI G - The rape and mur-

der of a student at Beijing 
University, China's most presti-
gious university, has set off stu-
dent demonstrations, in defiance 
of a general ban on public 
protests. 

The school, long an oasis for 
liberal ideas. was the intellectual 
epicenter of the huge pro-democ-
racy protests on Tiananmen 
Square in 1989 that ended violent-
ly when troops dispersed the pr0-
testers, killing hundreds. 

Officials art ever wary of stu-
dent movements at the university, 
and the cumnt protests come just 
two weeks before the June 4 
anniversary of the 1989 crack-
down. 

On TUesday evening, after the 

university belatedly announced 
the death Friday of a first-year stu-
dent, Qiu Qingfeng, hundreds of 
students held a VIgil filled with 
songs and chants and staged a sit-
in outside an administration 
building. 

They demanded to speak with 
top university officials. At one 
point, a few students forced their 
way into the building. 

The students resumed that 
protest Wednesday, ultimately 
forcing university officials to let 
them set up a memorial altar that 
they covered with candles and 
flowers. 

Although the core of the 
demands focused on campus 
security and the university'S 
responsibility for the death, the 

National News 

protest also gave students an 
opportunity to vent their anger on 
issues like rising tuition and 
anempts to limit student expres-
sion . 

"We can't stay silent: read a 
poster on campus on Tuesday.

officials urged students 
Wednesday "not to do anything 
excessive or emotional: 

Computer bulletin boards at

EPA Call. For Cuts In Levels of Arsenic in Dltnldng wat. 
WASHINGTON The 

Environmental Protection Agency 
on Wednesday proposed strict 
new rtgulations of arsenic in tap 
water, reducing by 90 percent the 
public's maximum exposUrt to the 
chemical, which causes cancer and 
is found at harmful levels in at 
least one out of 10 of the nation's 
community water supplies. 

The agency wants to lower the 
limit on arsenic from 50 parts per 
billion to five parts per billion, an 
approach that it estimatrd would 
cost $374 million a year and 
.would prevent scores of cancer 
cases and provide other major 
hl"llth benefits. 

Water utilities, while agreeing 
that the rules should be tightened. 
contended that this level of con-

trol would cost about four times as 
much as the alency claimed and 
that the health benefits wert not 
worth such an effort. 
Environmentalists called for an 
even stricter rule, saying the 

a~ency was accepting unusually 
hIgh cancer rislts. 

"The subject of arsenic hiS 
been debated at the EPA for the 
better part of a decade or more." 
said Charles j. Fox, assistant 
administrator of the EPA for water 
programs. "We think this is afford-
able, and it is important for public 
health protection. But in some 
communities they will see increas-
es in drinking water rates to pay for 
this additional heahh protection." 

The agency said the costs per 
household might be about $28 a 

year in households in larger cities. 
and about SS5 per household in 
communities oftewer than 10,000 
households. 

The burden would fall most 
heavily on states in the Southwest, 
whert many communities have 
tap water with high levels of 
arsenic. Other communities in the 
West, the Midwest and New 
England would be affected, espe-
cially those that rely on water 
found underground rather than 
streams and other surface water 
for their drinking water supplies. 

For example. the Albuquerque, 
N.M., water system, which serves 
mOrt than 400,000 people, has an 
anenic 1eve1 of 14 Plrts per billion, 
and the Nonnan, Olt1a., water sys-
tem, which serves 80,000 people. 

has arsenic levels at about 36 parts 
per billion, according to federal 
data complied by the Naturll 
Resources Defense Council. 

The agency estimated that 
6,600 utilities, or about 12 pemnt 
of all water suppliers in the nation, 
would have to take corrective 
action, and that the vast majority 
of them serve 10,000 homes or 
fewer. 

Arsenic in drinking water 
comes from industrial pollution, 
but more commonly from natural 
sources in the tUnd. Arsenic can 
cause not on lung. skin and 
bladder cancer t also diseases of 
the liver, blood vessels and other 
organs.

Penn Scales Back Institute in Aftennath of Patient's Death 
WASHINGTON -The scien-

tist who ran a gene therapy study 
that killed an 18-year-old patient 
at the University of Pennsylvania 
will no longer conduct experi-
ments on people, and the presti-
gious gene therapy institute he 
founded is being scaled back, uni-
versity officials announced 
Wednesday. 

Instead, Dr. James M. Wilson, 
who as director of the universi-
ty's Institute for Human Gene 
Therapy has been regarded as 
one of the bright young stars of 
his firld , will restrict his work to 
the study of molecules and cells, 
and will experiment only on ani-
mals. Those restrictions will also 
apply to other scientists working 
under the auspices of the insti-
tute. 

"We think that Dr. Wilson was 
overloaded with regard to 
responsibility: Prtsident Judith 
Rodin said at a news confertnce. 
Rodin described the decision as 
one in a series of steps the uni-

versity was taking to improve 
patient safety and to reduce any 
appearance of conflict of interest 
in rtsearch. 

The move will have no imme-
diate practical effect, because the 
Food, and Drug Administration 

said, although they will be 
reviewed by an ethics panel from 
now on. 

But for Wilson, who over the 
pist seven years had built his insti-
tute into the nation's largest acad-
emic gene therapy program, the 

The move will have no immediate practical effect, 
because the Food and Drug AdministTation has 
already suspended all human experiments there. 
Nor does it necessarily mean an end to gene 
therapy trials at the university, Doctors in other 
disciplines may conduct such experiments, Rodin 
said, although they will be reviewed by an ethics 
panel from now on. 
has already suspended all human 
experiments there. Nor does it 
necessarily mean an end to gene 
therapy trials at the university. 
Doctors in other disciplines may 
conduct such experiments. Rodin 

decision is a major setback. 
He is facing the threat of a law-

suit by the family of the young 
man who died, .Jesse Gelsinger, 
and still must contend with In 
FDA investigation, which showed 

a number of deficiencies in the 
program. 

The institute will also stop 
manufacturing the genetically 
altertd viruses, known as vectors, 
used to introduce genes into 
cells. 

Wilson did not grant inter-
views Wednesday, but issued a 
statement saying that he felt con-
fident that the ~~eps outlined 
would Mhelp position Penn as a 
model environment for the con-
duct of all types of clinical 
research, especially gene thera-
py." 

But Dr. W. French Anderson, 
who in 1990 conducted the first 
gene therapy experiment, 
aescribed Rodin's move as an 
overreaction. "This is throwinf 
the baby out with the bathwater, 
Anderson said. Mit basically elimi-
nates the gene therapy program if 
you can't run trials."

shows." Things have definitely looked up 
since Bradley's Kmart days, but the true 
wonder behind this man's fantastic voyage 

vie Wonder, 'ggy Pop and Stooges. As 
Bradley mUSically matured, his favorite 
influences came to include Ray Charles, Nat 
King Cole, Marvin Gaye, Hank Williams, 
Otis Redding. Jimmy Reed and Elvis Presley. 

"I always loved the singers,· Bradley said 
to The Washington Post. "That's what [ want-

Bradley went on to Pershing High

the small town of 
Evergreen, Ala. 

Blind since birth, 
Bradley was one of 14 
children on a SOO-

Bradley's sisters were 
also legally blind. but

Music was put on the 
back burner as he 
studied business

subsequently led 
Bradley to return to

Bradley's world. how-
ever, is completely dark, devoid of any 
vision . 

"' don't hear better. [ listen better,· said 
. Bradley to the Washington Post, dispelling the 

myth that the blind hear better. "[ use what 
G04 g.ave me." 

Bradley attended the Alabama School for 
the Blind in Talladega, Ala. when he came of 
school age. There, he learned to play piano 
and read music in braille, but the school's 
biggest contribution to his musical future 
was introducing him to Ray Charles. It was 
then that Bradley decided that he ·wanted to 
be a great singer." 

Bradley recalls fond memories of the 
school, even though the students were 
racially segregated at the time. Upon being 
asked how the students could "see" the seg-
regation taking place, Bradley amusingly 
replied, "Oh, you could tell, bu~ we didn't 
care that much. We had our own thinSS 
going." To this day, Bradley still keeps 10 
contact with many friends he met at the 
school. 

Bradley's family later moved to Detroit.

would not last long. 
"I was rock 'n roll,· Bradley recalled. "[ 

wasn't used to getting up at seven in the 
mornin$'" 

His Itch to. sing and perform would be 
satiated at numerous churches as he belted 
out soulful gospels for pocket change. 
Bradley did tour with a top 40 band playing 
cover songs, but later dropped out because 
of his aversion to performing other artists' 
music: "' felt I wasn't going to get some-
where doing somebody else." 

Bradley later married and had five chil-
dren. He had a nice house and a car, which 
his wife drove. Then he got a divorce. 

"Marriage just wasn't the spot , was 
looking for," Bradley said. 

In 1977, Bradley found the streets, which 
consequently became his stage for the next 
20 years. 

"I didn't stay in Detroit because I liked to 
move around; Bradley said. "There was still 
that '60s feeling, and people wanted to 
help." 

Bradley would spend the next chapter of 
his life in the bus stations of cities such as

Album Review: Ears 

Ibn 
Uz Jsme Doma 

-B+ 

IyJOHPHW 
Staff Writer 

Liverpool gave us The Beatles. 
Manchester gave us New Order 
and The Smiths. Seattle gave birth 
to alternative rock groups irvana 
and Soundgarden. Orange County 
and San Diego are home to a very 
strong punk music scene. Teplice, 
in the Czech Republic, gave us Uz 
Jsme Doma. 

"Excuse me? Teplice?" you ask 
with a single eyebrow raised in a 
quizzical manner. 

I must admit that Teplice is not 
quite the hotbed of incredible rock 
music, but from that small former 
border town, Uz jsme Doma (pro-
nounced OOZH smeh DOUGH-
mal were born in 1985, and their 
music has survived communism, 
numerous lineup changes and 
constant tounng. 

The band's music is a blend of 
punk rock with an ensemble of 
horns and saxophone. That might 
be con Ide red ka for orne group, 
but not in the case of Uz Jsme 
Doma. who take no pan In light, 

happy, $Uitar syncopation. 
Their unique mixture of punk 

rock, Czech folk melodies, jazz-
influenced instrumentals, energetic 
vocals (mostly in Czech) and non-

I stop touring have made them 
develop into an avant-garde rock 
band and earned them the reputa-
tion of being one of the best live 
rock acts in the world. 

Classical instruments such as 
the French hom and the bassoon 
round out the sounds from the 
piano, trumpet, accordion, trom-
bone and tuba to create a unique 
sound. The guitars incorporate 
classic punk rock rhythms with 
hammering basslines. 

Not one instrument leads the 
others; Uz Jsme Doma are almost 
orchestral in their playing. Lead 
singer, lead guitarist and pianist 
Mirek WaneK even writes out 
scores for all the instruments as 
they delve into uncom ... on time 
signatures. 

Their most recent studio 
album, Ears, takes the listener on 
quite a ride through different 
speeds and fragmented lyric Its 
songs start with light jazzy tunes 
that are soon interrupted by the 
crunch of punk rock guitars. 

"Sweat" drives the listener 
through precise playing with sharp 
tempo changes and a short jazz 
interlude. The intense staccatos of 
the drums and guitars coupled 
with the passionate, almost cine-
matic vocals are filled with an ener-
gy unmatched by any band 

After a long period of c mlnu-
nist-era suppression, Uz Js.me 
Doma are ready to burst out onto 
the musIc scene. 

Songs like ~TOin Icc" traipse 
along with a light, jazzy imro but 

explode into pounding guitars and 
panicky vocals that drip with 
despair, crying out, "We doubt all 
the time, and that makes us push 
on." 

The choir is dark and ominous 
as it croons along with the vocals 
that shout, "No solace I No solace 
for the human mass" in the song 
"Silence." 

With the Cold War freezing 
musical expansion and expression 
in Czechoslovakia, Uz Jsme Doma 
were only able to play four shows 
in 1986, and future gigs were 
always underground and few and 
far between. As tensions began to 
thaw, Uz Jsme Doma were able to 
perform 27 times in 1989. 

Since then, they have toured in 
the United States and met their 
musical inspiration, The Residents. 
In January 1996 Uz Jsme Doma 
were one of the first cultural 
ambassadors to Bosnia. as they 
played sold-out shows in Sarajevo, 
Mostar and Gorazde. . 

Now this unique rock act has 
returned to the United States and 
has made its way through New 
York, the Midwest and the South. 

Uz Jsme Doma will be one of 
. the most peculiar punk rock 

sounds you have ever heard, but 
open your ears and take in thiS odd 
combination of classical instru-
ments. Jazz and raw punk rock. 
Their ene~ on the album is dark 
yet electrifying. and you can be 
sure that they will reproduce that 
electricity in their live perfor-
mances. 

Vz Jsme Doma will make their 
way to Southern California on June 

with a gig at The Casbah 111 San 
Diego and a performance on June 9

'M:i-2' Breathes Life Back Into Action Films 
The summer movie marathon kicks off with Cruise and Woo 
., DAVlYIN 
Senior Staff Writer 

You have all seen the trailer. 
Tom Cruise - lean, tan and sexier 
than ever - clings to the side of a 
cliff with one hand, barely breaking 
a sweat. Then, in the next 
seque.nce, he is spiraling through 
the air in a slow-motion sidekick 
reminiscent of "The Matrix." 

Is this another star-powered. 
action-galore vehicle whose sole 
purpose is to a,zzle audiences with 
spectacular. computer-generated 
special effects? Fortunately, no. 
Director John Woo and producer 
Cruise dish out a tantalizing story 
10 times better and less confusing 
than the first "Mission: Impossi-
ble: making "Mission: [mpossible-
2" one of the best and most satis-
fying action films in recent memo-
ry. 

An action film cannot survive 
without a suspenseful and captivat-
ing plot, and "M:i-2" delivers by 
returning to the roots of the "Mis-
sion: Impossible" series. 

[nstad of making it a pantheon 
of Cruise close-ups, this film 
bqins with a realistic mission: Spy 
Ethan Hunt, played by Cruise. is 
sent to recover a dadly virus from 
a rogue agent. [n order to do so, he 
must employ the assistance of the 
menacing expert thid Naya Hall 
(Thandie Newton), who attempts 
to seduce villain Scan Ambrose, 
played by the prince (Dougray 
Scott) in -Ever Afttr." Hunt falls in 
love with Hall, and a couple of 
cIcvcr but predictable twists follow; 
a battle of wits and fists ensues 

between two highly trained and 
extremely dangerous secret agents. 

lWo main elements separate 
MM:i-2" from other recent action 
films. The first of these is the devel-
opment of meaningful relation-
ships. Instead of opening with a 
smashing action sequence, the film 
instead focuses on the love 
between Hunt anll Hall . This is 
crucial because it provides a com-
pelling incentive for the main char-
acter to accomplish his mission. 
Nothing is more personal than 
love. 

The love also is the driving force 
behind the rivalry between Hunt 
and Ambrose. who is presented as 
an intelligent and formidable 
adversary. This is the second dis-
tinguishing element - the factlhat 
the villain is just as smart - or 
smarter - than the hero. Both of 
these plot techniques have been 
employed again and again in every 
James Bond film - and why not? 
They always work. 

The acting. while not mind-
blowing, works well enough to 
accompany the story. Cruise is his 
usual self. His charm and intensity 
fit his character well, for Hunt is an 
agent who takes even the smallest 
details seriously. • 

A minor problem lies in 
Cruise's viability as a romantic 
lead. He seems too self-absorbed 
and cody to really fall in love with 
anyone. Newton is stunning as 
HaU, but her part calls for little 
more than looking pretty and help-
less. and poulin, a lot. . 

Scott's role IS well drawn out. 
He is auel, ruthless and methodi-

cal, but also human when he feels 
betrayed upon learning of Hall's 
seduction. 

-M:i-2" benefits a lot from the 
contributions of Hong Konf 
director Woo and MGladiator 
music composer Hans Zimmer. 
Woo has the ability to tum action 
into artistry, and his fight scenes 
are laced with acrobatic jump-
kicks, creative use of weaponry, 
and of course, flying white doves. 
Zimmer's exotic and pulse-
pounding score not only high-

the passion and heartbreak of the 
characters. There is an especially 
efftctive Spanish theme that cap-
tures the love between Hunt and 
Hall. ~ 

[f there is one problem with the 
film, it is the dry and somewhat 
lame dialogue. The best example 
can be attributed to legendary 
actor Anthony Hopkins. who says 
to Cruise, "This isn't Mission: Dif-
ficult, it's Mission: [mpossible." 
Note to screenwriter: This isn't 
Screenplay 101, this is a real 
movie. 

Overall, "M:i-2" offers a mix 
between the stellar plots of "James 
Bond: the spectacular special 
effects of MThe Matrix," and the 
satisfying action scenes from 
"Face-Off: It is the best action 
film in the last few years and the 
start of a franchise series in the 
spirit of "Lethal Weapon" and "Die 
Hard." 

The summer movie marathon 
has officially begun with "Mission: 
Impossible 2; and your mission, 
should you choose to accept it, is 
to see it.

Hip Hop Performer Goes Belly Up 
Del the Funky Homosapien came up short but Blackalicious invigorated the crowd at the Belly Up Tavern 
., CllAKO IUZIIU 
Staff Writer 

If there was ever a hip hop perfOlllWlce 
that moved an audience, it was that of 
Blackalicious at the Belly Up TavCl1l on 
May 16. 

material that he rally did not pcrfonn any of 
his stOOd. older mixes. Del even stopped in the 
mi&Dc of a H~ song to say he want-
ed to fOcus on tracks from the new album, 
which let down a lot of his longtime fans. 

Upcoming Events at the aelly Up Tavern 

Surprisingly. coheadliner Del the 
Funky Homosapian came up short in 
terms of feeding the crowds with energy, 
but Blackalicious and the hardcore Jewish 
rap group Blood of Abraham supplied 
plenty of Juice. 

Blackalicious. whose funky sounds and 
old-school beats arc a fresh step away from 
most hip hop groups. got the audience 
involved with much . head-bobbing. They 
recently released a new album, Nia, which 
was the focus of their performance. Some 
pieces were taken off their Ouannum Prujtcts 
album, and tracks from their older albums 
were also a big hit with the Belly Up audi-
ence. 

Del's new album, Both Sides of the Brain, 
was a disappointment compared to his for-
mer album, No Nttd for Alarm, which was 
part of the reason why his performance was 
not as good as it could have been. 

Del was so set on hyping up his new 

Del did, however, perform classics such 
as "Boo-Boo Heads" and "No Need for 
Alarm: but this was a small consolation for 
those who wanted more. Instead. Del deliv-
ered some meaningless crap about video 
games in his session. Unfortunately. DeI's 
crazy onstage energy was muffled by a 
much calmer and more sober attitude. 

Blackalicious' Gift of Gab was absolutely 
amazing with frantic hand movements 
during his quick flow of syncopated 
rhythms. TheIr vocalist had a very old. 
soulful voice with hooks so stylish that 
even the shyest fans could not resist 
swiveling their hips just a little. The crazy 
alliterations and tongue twisters off their 
track "From A to G" also wowed the 
crowd. 

All in all. Blackalicious showed Del up 
and made the audience want to go out and 
grab their newest album, Gift of Gab. Hope-
fully, it was just a bad night for Del, as his 
live performance left the Belly Up with a 
whimper.

One day in the winter of '91, 
Bradley found himself back in

The weathered musician would 
place his ear against numerous 
storefronts. trying to $Ct the best 
acoustics from his envIronment. 

"You can make it sound like 
you're singing in stereo, like you're 
an ~plified man. Every city has 
got Its sweet spots. " 

Once Bradley found his "sweet 
spot." he would plop down on his 
stool and begin playing one of his 
original sons$. Remarkably. he 
never put hIS music down on 
paper, although he could read and 
wnrc music in braille. 

-Well, say I wrote 200 songs a 
year. played on the struts 12

more than 1,000 at least. Of

However. nothing is ever stable

"I would go for $100 a day;

Depended on whether the mood 
was there," Bradley said about how 
he economically survived while

right mood. God says go to work.

When asked where he stayed 
every night, he answered with a 
devilish grin. 

"Well. quite naturally, playing 
on the street I'd meet people, 
maybe a woman. and tell her my 
worldly stories - and they'd invite 
me home." 

After enough invitations, 
Bradley had created a network of 

"We went 
down and brought him in to record 
him just for the hell of it, and it was 
unbelievable," Andrew said. 

"The thing that was missing for 
us was the vocals," Andrew said, 
"and Robert had that and a whole 
lot more." Bradley was not looking 
for a band at that time. but the two 
pushed the formation of the group 
by hiring seasoned drummer Jeff 
Fowlkes. 

"We didn't want anything." 
Andrew said. "We had a studio. We 
had our music. We didn't give a 
damn, but we knew this thing with 
Robert was good. and so we sent 
some tapes out: 

An RCA representative got 
ahold of one of the tapes labeled 
Robtr1 Bradley's BIoduxutr- Surprisl, 
and was entranced by the smooth 
mix of blucs, ballad and rock. The 
record label gave the band a con-
tract and the public found a true 
jewel in the haystack of boy bands 
and dead rock groups. 

Robtrt Bradley's l1lactwam- Sur-
prise has been compared to Otis 
Redding. The Black Crowes. Dave 
Matthews Band. Beck and Maceo 
Parker. 

Bradley's voice is rich with 
emotion and expression. His lyrics 
can be anguished. scared and 
lovesick, but also tinged with a 
Bob ~I~-csque humanity. 

Llstemng to Bradley and his 
B/aclwater Surprise brings instant 
appreciation. It does not take two 
or three times through to under-
stand the magic beneath Bradley's 
voice. The band does a remarkable 
job of ! 1 .. lging all the slight 
n';1llnces of B!'Idfey's voice to light 
WIthout taking away from his 
infectious stage presence. 

Bradley is. quite possibly, this 
decade's best musical find - and 

~t the hearty a$e of 50, Bradley has 
Just begun hIS career in many 
respects. 

"Myoid aunt was 101 when 
she died." Bradley said, "and she

and that's what I'm going to do."

school or a graduate school in pub-
lic health," Lepke said. 

"Allison was the hardest worker 
on the team and a great leader for 
us." McGihon said. 

Poole is taking her degree in ani-
ma! physiology and neuroscience 
and is remaining at UCSD to work 
toward her master's in biology. She 
plans to go to medica! school and 
return to work in San Diego. 

"It was tough, but rewarding." 
Poole said about being a captain. "I 
was the one that was doing the con-
soling. when only last year or the 
year before I was the one being con-
soled." 

A real success story for the 
Tritons is Snyder. She came to 
UCSD looking to play tennis and 

escape the rainy Portland weather. 
With the sun always shining. she 
decided the water was the best place 
to be, and after two years of hard 
training to make up for no real pool 
experience, Snyder was on the ream. 

"She went home and trained real 
hard," McGihon said. "She is a great 
example of being able to do whatev-
er you put your mind to" 

Next fall, Snyder starts graduate 
study in kinesiology at the 
University of Texas. 

Amold is another superb gradu-
ating swimmer. She is going to grad-
uate with a degree in psychology 
and plans to attend graduate school 
for clinical psychology or medica! 
school for psychiatry. She came to 
UCSD for the academics and swim-
ming. 

"It meant a lot to me," said 
Arnold of placin~ third in nationals 
this year. "Commg in, we were a 
large group of girls. and after finish-
ing a close fourth a couple of years. 
it was a really incredible experience

tations and place • 

Like Amoki, Rubino is graduat-
ing with a degree in psycho~. She 
has no immediate plans and will stay 
in San Diego and enjoy the freedom 
of life without school. 

Tjoa also put in the effon this 
year, as she combined with three 
other swimmers to break the 
school record in the 400 medley 
by three seconds, an enormous 
amount. She graduates with a 
biology degree and is thinking 
about business school as a possi-
ble option. Coaching is a possibil-
ity, but not in the near future. 

"Ymessa had a continued level of 
high performance all year: 
Mcgihon said. "1lte effort she and 
the other girls put into breaking that 
record, considering it was only set 
last year, was incredible.· 

These girls came in t~er four 
years ago as one of the largest 
groups of freshman swimmers ever 
to enter UCSD. They have been 

-. 

through trials and tribulations 
together, including a default this 
year at nationals that kept the team 
from placing second, and a change 
of coaches in their sophomore year. 
Instead of driving a devisive stake 
between them, these experiences 
have only drawn them closer 
together. 

It was Rebecca Arnold that put it 
best when she quipped, "We 
became such good friends. I have 
friends here that I will be friends 
with for life. We are really close and 
our closeness made us better as a 
team. It was such an incredible 
group of people." 

Together they came in and 
together they leave, but what remain 
are the friends they made, and what 
better thing is there to have than 
friends? 

"' wish all my fellow swimmers 
good luck: Poole said. 

Although they will not need it, 
may these eight graduating seniors 
have all the luck in the world.

Slosh: 
Winning and drinJeing 
part of the Guardian way 
Koala players seemed to thrive off 
the beer and Booze-ade, we were 
debilitated. Our last resort, and 
only hope, was to argue ... and 
argue everything. Backed by the 

~usto of Lisa Huff and my own 
Incessant mouth, the Guardian 
team stymied and bewildered the 
drunken Koalas. (In slosh ball when 
there's a controversial play, 
whichever team argues loudest and 
longest gets the call. The trouble is, 
since there are no officials. every-
one's an umpire.) The Koala retali-
ated by giving our players large 
quantities of Booze-ade. 

At this point, my memory is a 
liule hazy. . 

I do recall , however, that for the 
next three innings, we couldn't 
even get anyone to third base. 
There was also a ceaseless stream 
of trash talking, mostly from the 
Koala side, specifically from former 
Koala editor Evan "E-Dogg" 
Hoozler. 

This led to several drunken 
skirmishes. They would start with 
two play rs bumping chests and 
spitting and end with a flurry of 
grass stains, dirt and beer. Then the 
other players would avenge their 
comrades with more beer throw-
ing. Even Jenny Sposito, our ace 
keg attendant (the one who pours 
beer for the players that reach sec-
ond base), joined in the scuffles 
with precise beer tossing. All in all 
it was qui te amusing. 

Final scene: Everyone is stl<;ky 
and covered in scum. It's the top of 
the seventh, and last, inning and 
there's one out. With both teams 
yelling, the keg tapped and the 
Guardian down 11-16, the game 
looked hopele56. At last, two run-
ners are brought home. Then slug-
ger White brought three more 
home wi th a monster blast to right-
center to tie th e game. In an 
instant, the tide had turned. 

Tie game, men on second and

Country: 
Departing seniors will 
leave a hole in leadership 

helped each other out." 
Harley will be trading in his 

sneakers for a set of scrubs, as he 
~i11 be doing research in prepara-
tion for his application to medical 
school in fall of 2001 . 

Damian Garcia will also leave 
UCSD this spring after a produc-
tive career with the cross country 
team. He remembers the bond that 
developed between the runners on 
the team. 

"The other guys on the squad 
made running memorable for me.: 
Damian .Garcia said. "Practicing 
and preparing for the meets, we 
were like a family and I'll remember 
those days for the rest of my life." 

For the immediate future, 
Damian Garcia plans to move back 
to his hometown of Los Angeles 
and work for a \ .. h :l'!, then head 
back to school to pI' lip his MBA. 

Clarke and Levin-S,.ler are two 
athletes who will be remembered as 
much.for their off-track leadership 
as for their running exploits. Both 
fifth-year seniors, they were the 
ones that their teammates looked 
to for assistance. 

"They were two guys with great 
perspectives, not only on running, 
but on college and life in general. 
You could always talk to them 
about whatever was going on; 
Damian Garcia said. 

Levin-Soler was a consistent 
runner who tallied some 
respectable scores, such as a first 
place in the UCI Dual Meet and a 
fourth in the Point Loma Dual. 

Clarke came up big this past 
season, as the injuries that have 
hindered him much of his career 
abated and he was able to con-
tribute some key scores, including 
a fifth in the Point Lorna Dual 

Meet and a 14th in the NCAA 
Division III Western Regional 
Championships. 

Another athlete who is' leaving 
behind a big pair of cross country 
shoes to fill is Nathan Garcia, a 
solid performer for the Thtons. 
Highlishts of his career include a 
ninth In the Division III Western 
Regionals and a third in the Point 
Lorna Dual Meet. 

Nathan Garcia fondly remem-
bers the Western Regionals. where 
the nitons grabbed an upset win. 
"Everyone made the trip to suppon 
the team, even the guys who 
weren't competing, and the atmos-
phere was just amazing with every-
one coming together." 

After graduation this spring, 
Nathan Garcia will enter the gradu-
ate leaching program here at DCSD 
to prepare himself for instructing at 
the elementary school level. As. a 
graduate student he will continue 
his track and field pursuits for 
UCSD, for which he has one 
remaining year of eligibility. 

Wangler, who contributed a 
respectable 26th in the NCAA 
championships and a 35th in the 
Western Regionals, will also be 
heading for greener pastures and 
will be missed by his teammates. 

"He has only been competing 
since his sophomore year, and had 
no cross country background, yet 
he has had a major impact on the 
team, contributing some important 
scores at the big meets," Garcia said. 

After many years of excruciating 
stretching, carbo-loading and 
pounding the pavement, it is time 
for these six men to move on. 
While it is sad to see this era come 
to an end, they should be proud 
that their hard work and determi-
nation has been of immense bene-
fit to Thton athletics. 

Congratulations go out to 
these men for their accomplish-
ments representing UCSD, and 
good luck to them in their future 
endeavors.

Sloshball 
Highlights 
The Guardian Spanks 
The Koala 17-16 
By MARC COMER 

Most of Sun God weekend is a 
blur to me, but what I do remem-
ber is that the annual Guardian-
Koala slosh ball game was quite pos-
Sibly the greatest slosh ball game 
ever. 

For those who have never 
played sloshball, here's a hint: 
Think softball with alcohol. A keg 
IS placed on second base, and to 
get to third, the runner has to 
pound a beer. This seems to result 
in a lot of doubles. The only other 
ground rule is that beer is gold; 
any spilling requires a limb to be 
hacked off. All other rules are sub-
ject to interpretation, and, as one 
can imagine, the more drinking, 
the more interpretation. Toward 
the end of the game it often seems 
as if there are 18 inebriated Bobby 
Knights on the field . 

Last year's game ended in con-
troversy with the Koala team, and a 
slew of ringers that couldn't even 
spell koala, winn ing 21-20. This 
year, the Koala. with ringers again, 
looked to stomp the underdog 
Guardian tea m, laden with sloshball 
rookies. 

Here's the scene: one pony keg, 
four or five cases of MGD and an 
unknown amount of Booze-ade, a 
potent amalgam of alcohol devel-
oped by highly skilled Koala 
chemists to stun even the heftiest 
of elephant seals. The alcohol was 
the least of our worries. 

After scheduling problems with 
the ultimate Frisbee teams on 
Pryatel field (near the engineering 
building) , the game finally got 
underway. The Koala team, which 
had started the game off right by 
drinking immediately, scored a 
quick six runs. Then, with only half 
an inning down, the police showed 
up. Apparently, we weren't sup-
posed to have a truck parked on 
the field and the keg was definitely 
a no-no. Fortunately, they didn't 
confiscate the alcohol and simply 
told us to go home. 

It would take far more than a lit-
tle police intimidation to thwart 
this tradition. At the suggestion of 
a seasoned slosh ball player from 
the Koala side, the game was moved 
to a safer location that must remain 
undisclosed. 

Game on. 
In the Guardian's first at bat, it 

looked as if we should have just 
stayed at home with our Sun God 
hangovers. The first inning ended 
with the brilliant Koala defense 
making a spectacular double-play. 
The next inning brought more 
humiliation. The KDal4 was all over 
us. Even when we were getting 
some good contact, the golden 
glove of all-star Tulley Raferty kept 
us from scoring. 

Finally, with our powerhouse 
Jeff White hitting well and the KDal4 
players arguing amongst them-
selves, we scored some runs. Our 
defense, however, was pathetic. If it 
weren't for the KDal4 striking out so 
much, I'm not sure we would have 
ended a single inning. Every time 
we had a guaranteed play at first, 
we'd over-throw the outstretched 
mitt of Lisa Huff, last year's 
Guardian MVP. 

Then, as we reached second 
base more frequently, the alcohol 
started to take its toll . While the

A Wet Time in Michigan 
The men's golf team places eighth, Sullivan and Hansen 29th at the Division III championships

Sports Editor 

Golf and rain do not mix. 
Neither do golf and lightning. 
The CAA Division III men's 

golf championship at the Bedford 
Valley Golf Course in Battle Creek, 
Mich. had its final day of play cut 
short due to rain last week. 

Using the previous three days of 
scores, the UCSD golf team fin-
ished eighth out of the 23 partici-

patin~ schools. 
· We did not play as well as we 

could have: golf Coach Mike 
Wydra said. "It's the worse finish 
we've had in 10 years. We've placed 
in the top four in nine of the last 10 

. years: 
The weather and the unfamiliar-

ity with the course played a part ih 
the poor scores.

Cross Country Team 
to Lose Several Stars 
Members of the most enduring men on campus 
are running off into the sunset come this June 
IJICOIT ........ 
Steff Writer 

The UCSD men's 'cross 
country team is graduating 
many athl~tes this sprin$. ath-
letes that have contrtbuted 
greatly to the program during 
their tenure. The 'tritons will 
miss the effons of seven depart-
ing seniors when they lace up 
their sneakers next season. Mike 
Wangler, Joshua Levin!Soler, 
Kevin Harley, Rory Clarke, and 
Nathan and Damian Garcia will 
all be moving on, yet will fondly 
remember their days in the 
Triton blue and gold. 

As Damian Garcia remi-
nisces. "It is sad to think that 
after all these years of working 
together two to three hours a 
day. I might not get to see a lot of 
these guys again, but being able 
to be a pan of this team has 
made these last four years the 
best of my life: . 

Each member of the cross 

country squad made contribu-
,tions to the team throusth his 
efforts. Hard work and diligence 
paid off when it was time for the 
athletes to hit the course, as was 
the case with Harley. 

Harley came into prominence 
just this past season after con-
stant improvement. He made it 
into the top seven on the team 
and got a chance to compete in 
some of the more imponant 
meets, ' such as the Thton 
Invitational and the Regional 
Championships in Ponlancf. Ore. 

Harley remembers the long 
afternoons of practice. 

"It was great to be out there 
day in and day out. working hard 
to get better: he said. 

He also recalls the cama-
raderie that developed. 

"Working with the other 
guys on the team was a real 
highlight for me. We pushed 
each other to improve and
