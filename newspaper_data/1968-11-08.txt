Undergrads to Vote 
on Compulsory Fee 

On Monday, Nov. 25, under-
graduate students of the Univer-
sity of Calif. at San Diego will 
be asked to vote on a consti-
tutional amendment concerning 
the payment of student fees. The 
fees specifically in question are 
the $6.00 per quarter Associated 
students fee which every under-
graduate student is required to 
pay. 

The purpose of the vote is to 
determine whether the students 
wish to continue the policy of 
compulsory fees which has been 
in operation since 1965. For 
it was in 1965 that students of 
this university voted over four 
to one to initiate the compul-
sory collection of an Associated 
students' fee. 

As overwhelming as this vote 
was, it was presented in the form 
of s simple referendum, not a 
constitutional amendment. Thus 
as the university has grown over 
the intervening years, a ques-
tion has arose as to whether 
this vote should still be consi-
der .ct binding on the students. 

In an effort to answer this 
question, the Associated students 
and other members ofthe college 
community are proposing an 
amendment to the constitution 
which would permanently estab-
lish the compulsory collection 
of fees. 

On Nov. 25, the undergraduates 
of UCSD will vote on the adop-
tion of the following constitu-
tional amendment: 

The ASUCSD shall continue its 
activities supported by collection 
of a quarterly fee from its mem-
bers. The ASUCSD shall increase 
this fee only with the consent 
of the membership at large. 

By decree of the Chancellor, 

this referendum must have a60% 
turnout in order for its results 
to be valid. Otherwise the sta-
tus quo cannot be again challenged 
for two quarters. 

In order to gain some per-
spective on the question of stu-
dent fees, a survey of the fee 
policy of the other university 
campuses was undertaken. Re-
sults of the survey show a wide 
variation in the amount of fees 
charged per quarter, butnovari-
ation in the form of payment, 
which was compulsory. 

Examples of this are Riverside 
campus which charges a compul-
sory $13,00 combination Asso-
ciated student and student Union 
fee. At this campus there has 
been no effort made to change 
the compulsory status of the fee. 
Santa Barbara collects an $11.00 
per quarter compulsory fee, and 
once again this fee has not been 
challenged in recent years. 

Irvine campus collects a com-
pulsory fee of $7.00 per quarter, 
a fee which was ratified by the 
students two years ago. Davis 
campus has a recent history of 
challenges to its $5.00 compul-
sory fee, including a referendum 
three years ago, but all such 
effort have failed. 

Berkeley campus has a $4.00 
compulsory fee for students, plus 
a sizeable student union and 
activity fee, which amounts to a 
total of $18.00, although control 
over the spending of such reve-
nue has been removed from the 
Associated students by the ad-
ministration. The compulsory 
nature of the fee has always 
come under attack, but hasfaUed 
repeatedly. UCLA has a simi-
lar fee to that of Berkeley which 
has also been challenged, but 
these efforts have been defeated. 

Winter Registration 
Scheduled Nov. JJ- J4

AS Leaders 
Launch 
Crusade 

Tom Shepard, AS President, 
has organized a crusade along 
with the ASUC Pre~idents' Coun-
cil to promote better relations 
between the people of our state 
and the University by holding a 
discussion on television with our 
Governor. 

They hope to clear up "misun-
derstandings among both the stu-
dents and the general public· 
over "problems whichnowthrea-
ten the university.· 

Last week the AS presidents 
sent the Governor a telegram in-
viting him to such a meeting. 
Reagan replied: 

"Thank you for your telegram. 
As I am sure you know, it has 
been the Governor's practice, and 
It will continue to be his prac-
tice to meet with student repre-
sentatives, campus editors and 
others. Governor Reagan is 
always pleased to meet with you 
to discuss in a calm and rea-
sonable manner the vital issues 
facing the University. 

"For that reason the Governor 
does not believe a televised dis-
cussion at this time would really 
and significantly provide the an-
swers to the problems all of us 
are eager to resolve.· 

Now the AS presidents are 
raising funds to buy ads in the 
major papers of our state to 
urge the people to encourage 
Reagan to meet. They have writ-
ten large companies for contri-
butions. 

The ASUC Presidents' Council 
said the discussion would "make 
it possible for different ideas to 
be presented and examined byall 
the people of the state. 

"As Governor Reagan has said, 
the University is sometimes not 
sensitive to the interests and 
concerns of the people. We want 
to insure that with respect to the 
crisis now confronting the Uni-
versity we are as sensitive as 
possible to the concerns of the

. Nixon' 5 the 
President-elect Richard M. Nixon. 

Come on America, what kind of a put-on is this? Look at what 
you've done. At a time of deepening division within the country 
between rich a nd poor, young and old, whites and blacks, doves and 
hawks, you've reacted by electing a man who really doesn't relate 
to any oC these problems. In fact, he's totally irrelevant to them. 
Why do you insist upon taking a step backwards by sum moning up . 
from the ranks a voice from the past. a man who had his training 
in a different era, a man who insists upon applying the logic of that 
era to the problems of today, and a man who has had nothing to offer. 
of any value, throughout the years to the solutions of the real problems 
we face ? 

What' s that. America, you say you didn't have a choice? Well, that's 
true, but you're not going to get off the hook that easily. Surely you 
must know something about the background of this man who now speaks 
in the name of all Americans. Let's take a look at his stand on the 
most pr essing problems of the day. , 

The Race cr isis . Hm...it seems like Mr. Nixon gave the South 
Spiro Agnew to please them and pacify Strom Thurmond. At the 
Republican convention it leaked out that Nixon told a pr ivate gathering 
of Republica n dignitaries that he could never have backed such irre-
sponsible legislation as the Voting Rights Bill or the Open Housing 
law. But of cour se we must give him one thing--he's got Wilt Cham-
berlain's support. 

Poverty. Spiro Agnew said that it you've seen one slum YOU 'VE 
seen them all. How about you Mr. Nixon? We do know that you' vE 
consistently opposed nearly all legislation designed to bring relie' 
to the nation's poor. You've opposed urban renewa programsi. YOI 
opposed Medicare, but now support it because it's expedient. But, 
let 's not be so hasty to prejudge you. You must have your own solu-
tions--responsible Republican solutions. Funny thing, though, we' VE 
never heard you offer any positive alternatives unless you consider 
doing nothing an alternative. 

Vietnam war. There 's not much we can say on this, Mr. Nixon, 
for you have categorically reCused to comment on this topic. You 
are to be admired, though; you're probably the first pr esident to 
be elected who completely avoided the issue of foremost importance 
to many, many Americans. 

Foreign policy. On this count you must stand of the record of 

One What? 
nists at the Paris Peace talks. The NEW Nixon is the Nixon who would 
concentrate on building up our military superiority, so we can show 
the world we're number 1. Then they won't mes s with us. That' s 
the NEW Nixon-Thoroughly Modern MUhaus. 

But lest we forget, Richard Nixon, although you offer nothing to the 
poor, the young, and the black, you are a shining ray of hope for 
many Americans. You have assured stock and bond holders throughout 
the country that you will protect their interests. The Southerners know 
that you won't sell them out and that the Supreme Court is now "safe" 
from the Northern liberals. The military-industrial complex couldn 't 
be happier for they know that Richard Nixon won't hamper them in 
the s lightest in their quest for economic domination throughout the 
world, and will even be happy to accomodate them by continuing and 
supporting neo-colonialism. 

Yes, America, you wanted a change and you got one. But what kiM 
of warped logic is that that opts for a change even whenU's a change for 
the worse? Things are bad, but like the ostrich you ' re trying to hide 
your bead in the saoo by electing a man who claims he will wipe out 
our problems by a show of force. 

Yes, Nixon's the one ••• he 's tbe one who is most assuredly not 
aualUied to lead this nation. '

Dialogues DisappOinting 
Dear Triton Times Editor: 

Last week I att ended the se-
cond session of the student- fa-
culty dialogues . Understanding 
that discussion was open to every 
and anything, I expected at least 
some congenial conversation with 
faculty members. However from 
the experience in my gro~p and 
talking with a member ofanother 
group, my observation is tllat 
the dialogues did not provide the 
opportunity tor open talk, but 
already had its mind limited 
into narrow corridors. 

I was curious to see what 
the faculty and students could 
talk to each other about, and 
all that came up were racism 
Vietnam, Cleaver, Reagan, Rat-' 
ferty, Regents, and the life ex-
pectancy of UCj Columbia, Ber-
keley, Santa Cr uz, Santa Bar-
abra, and San Diegoj SDS and 
TNC; and the manifestations of 
student activism and violence and 
student- faculty alienation and ap-
athy. If this is all students 
and faculty have to talk to each 
other about, then it might be 
conc luded that the UCSD com-
munity is concerned about only 
simple absurdities (eg. the Viet-
nam war, and Ronald Reagan), 
or that problems consist of mere-
ly superficial manifestations 
(violence, Reagan) and that there 
is no need for insight or that 
the intellectual capacity of this 
campus has atrophied into a prune 
pit. 

Disappointed I was . Not that 
the topics discu~sed did not have

Rumper and Police;' 
by Herman Rumper . Pigs or People? 
Two weeks ago, I tried to clar-

ify the reasons behind the policy 
of calling the police "pigs". 
Since that time I have had some 
static ot both a personal and 
printed nature which has en-
couraged me to pursue the matter 
in more detail. 

The main purpose of mytormer 
article, I might mention, was to 
generally outline the rationale 
behind the terminology - in I his 
article I should like to go into 
some detail about the nature of 
"pig guilt". 

The reaction that I got to my 
former article was less a cr i-
ticism of the applicability ot 
the term "pig" to a certain type 
of behavior and more a criti-
cism of the legitimacy of pre-
dicating this type of behavior 
of the po lice in gene ra!. 

Brutality the Rule 
I should like to maintain that 

the type of behavior which I 
previously outlined as "piggish" 
is rightly attributed to the polic~ 
and that one Is justified in con-
demning the civil police, (as 
opposed to private police,) and 
finding them guilty in this regard. 
To establish thi s I would like 
to separate those actions which 
I shall caU actual crimes from 
those actions or inactions which 
·1 shall designate as complicity. 

I maintained previously that 
criminality and brutality are the 
r ule not the exception. Is this 
blanket indictment justified? Let 
us take as an example some 
articles in the L.A. Times that 
appeared during the week most 
of my critics were writing. 

One article noted that an L_A. 
Assemblyman petitioned the 
Justice Dept. to investigate the 
brutal gunning down of an 

, unarmed black man who resisted 
arrest on a traffic misdemeanor. 
The police involved had been 
exculpated by their department 
as bavingactedin "selfdefense" . 

During the previous week, you 
wUl remember, one Tim Thomp-
son was gunned down while re-
sisting an eviction notice right 
here in San Diego. After being 
downed by four shots in the chest 
by tow sheriff' s deputies, a San 
Diego "pig" stood over him and 
fired point blank into his neck. 
Witnesses obse rved this. 

Again back to the L.A. Times, 
an article on Thomas Cahill, 
who is incidentally president of 
the International Association of 
Chiefs of Police, cited three 
examples of criminality under his 
auspices. 

A "pig" in Oakland, who was 
accustomed to wearing a "gas 
Huey" pin while on duty in a 
Black neighborhood, shot and 
killed a black bus driver while 
he was "off duty". This occur-
red after a minor traffic acci-
dent. After commiting this cold ' 
blooded murder before four wit-
nesses, he then threatened the 

onlookers with "I wanl to kill 
a nigger so bad I can taste 
it. J ust make one move and 
I'll kill you." The witnesses 
were then arrested on trumped 
up charges of conspiracy and 
attempt to commit murder. Tbe 
.off-duty "pig" was released. 

It was only through the vigi-
lance of the Chronicle that those 
four were r eleased and the real 
murderer was , with great reluc-
tance, imprisoned :. Two other 
incidents involving off-duty 
"pigs" were the brutal beating 
of several youths by two off-
duty tactic:l. l squad members who 
were on a drunken rampage, 
and the shooting of a Chinese 
woman by another off-duty "pig". 
"Pigs" Threaten Strike 

But these examples of murder 
and brutality are only a part 
of the picture. We find, for 
example, that in the case inOak-
land involving the shooting-up of 
the Black Panther Party oftice 
by two on-duty' 'pigs", witnesses 
swore that there were in fact 
eight "pigs" in four "pig" cars, 
but since the witne sses were only 
able to get the license plate of 
one of the cars, Chief Cahlll, 
the head of the International Assn. 
of Police Chiefs, refused to be-
lieve that the other six existed. 

Nor was this compliCity bad 
enough. When public indignation 
and political pressure forced Ca-

- hill to take action against these 
bandits, 200 other pigs threatened 
to strike in support of their 
·'brothers". What better ex-
ample of complicity is thi!"re? 
It Is as criminal as the actions 
of 200 other "pigs" in New 
York, who, wearing Wallace pins, 
attempted to act as vigilantes 
in the corridors of aN. Y. Court-
house. 
Responsible to Whom? 
What arrogancej what af-

frontery; to mock the law in the 
halls of justice itself. During 
the week I wrote my last article 
on the "pigs", the L.A. Times 
was quoted as stating: "A large 
portion of the 2200 man police 
force in Cleveland is moving 
toward open revolt against city 
hall." The pollce refused to 
listen, even to those elected of-
ficIals who are their lawful su-
periors. 

The charge of complicity is 
not, however, reserved for the 
many who actively endorse and 
support pollce lawlessness, but 
extends to all those fellow of-
ficers who endorse it by their 
silence. We find , for example, 
a persistant and violent oppo-
sition across the nation to any 
talk of civilian police review 
boards. If the police are the 
servants of the people as they 
pretend to be, why do they fear 
a review board? Surely they 
must have something to hide. 

November 8, lS68 

On the matter of being respon-
sible to the public I might note 
here that in San Diego, the police 
are responsible to a non-elected 
official, the city manager and 
therefore are not directly or even 
indirectly responsible to the vot-
ing public. Why is that? We 
see therefore, actual crime by 
some, actual criminal compJJcity 
by many, and passive compliCity 
by all the others. In addition 
we see criminal and anti-social 
character reflected in the poli-
'des of the chiefs and leaders 
of departments and the policies 
of the forces in general. 
Over'polic ing a Problem 

This should not be at all sur-
prising. We know that the po-
lice ,are under-paid and there-
fore many potentially law-abiding 
men are turned away. We can 
also see that public disdain and 
soctal contempt discourages 
others and tends to weed out 
those with an humanitarian bend. 
We find also, a low level of 
mentality. In the L.A.P.D., for 
example, over 20% had not even 
finished the eighth grade. An-
other factor is that the majority 
of M.P.s in the Service enter 
civilian police work after their 
tour of duty. Almpst all M.P.s 
are enlistees who volunteer for 
this type of work. Now M.P.s 
deal with certain types of people 
in very specUic age groups and 
under very unique circumstances 
which are not representative of 
the general society. Moreover, 
they enforce more rigid and tri-
vial laws than those found in 
the general society. After three 
or four years of this, much of 
the m1l1tary experience carries 
over into law enforcement In 
civilian life thus accounting for 
its predominance among civilian 
police. Most police have seen 
military service and many have 
served as M.P. 's, S.P. ' s 
or A.P. 's. This is expecially 
true in S.an Diego, where, in-
cidentally, most are from South-
ern states. st11l another factor 
to be considered is the problem 
of over-poUcing. In New York, 
for example, there is one pig 
for every 200 citizens; that's a 
lot of coverage. Over-policing 
manifests itself in busy worle 
like arbitrary questioning and 
harassment of the public. Yet 
another factor is the psycho-
logical one. Continuous en-
counters with criminal elements 
creates the impression in many 
that the people are the enemy, 
and force that should be reserved 
for unique cases is lavished over 
the general population. Sociolo-
gical studies have shown that 
pollce work engenders brutality 
and over aggressiveness, forex-
ample, police have a higher rate 
of murders while off duty than 
the general population. 

If we look at our campus po-
lice (notice I said 'police') we 
find a marked distinction. They 
are more mature and no doubt 
went into police work when con-
ditions wer very dlfferentj when 
the cop walked the beat and knew 

his people. Much 
tradition" is maintained by these 
men and while there are some 
who would scoff at them Cor not 
being SS men, they get their 
job done quietly, unobtrusive ly 
and amicably. If the civil police 
were llke our campus police, 
there would be not need to talk 
of "pigs". This, however ls 
obvious ly not the case. ' 

Might I add that I am an 
X-pig; pig, because, while I my-
self never used my club unjustly 
on anyone and only once had 
occasion to fire my gun (at a 
r:l.pist), I nevertheless stood by 
on many occasions and witness 
fellow officers beat captives, 
provoke suspects into striking 
out, hit people injured in auto 
accidents, use undue force in 
restraining the mentally ill, the 
aged and the intoxicated, use their 
position to get personal revenge 
by the use of "shit-lists" and 
intimidate merchants to ga~ per-
sonal favors and goods. 1 W:l.~ 
personally associated with over 
400 M.P.'s and 70 civil polic4 
:l.nd I can say that I lound cri-
minality, brutality and disrespect 
for the law to be the rule no1 
the exception. 

Personal Testimony 
I add this personal testimony 

not as the primary credentia 
Cor the valldlty of my indict· 
ment (a credential which, I'n 
sure surpasses those of many 0 
my critics) but merely as anothel 
fact among a mountain of fact: 
that justifies me in predicatinr 
"pig" of the civil police as : 
whole. If this logic is stil 
not good enough for some, Ie 
me put it this way; "the po-
lice are " is, at least a state-
ment about a portion of the real 
world that has a very high pro-
bability of being true. It is not 
only verifiable on the basis of 
existing data, but confirmable 
by your own observations. 

To sum up then: a signifi-
cant number of police have act -
ually committed violent crimes' 
such criminals go unpunished: 
police departments harbor, con~ 
done and encourage these cri-
minals and are therefore guilty 
before and after the Iact; many 
individual police have actively 
endorsed and encouraged such 
crimes and are therefore guilty 
of complicity while the others 
sit idly by and do nothing when 
they have a sworn responsibi-
lity to law and justice. It makes 
no more sense to say that there 
are only a few bad apples than 
it does to say that there were 
only a few bad appl~ s among the 
SS, and therefore they too were 
not all guilty. The pigs are 
free to speak out against t!lese 
attrocities or renounce their 
jobs. They have free will. The 
police are therefore gullty 
charged so I say and I say it 
again; we have a police force 
that is nothing but a pig force, 
and if you don't see that yet, 
things will becom mor :l.nd 
more clear to you.

Frager to ¥or~ 
Award-winning Piece 

The UCSD Committee for Arts 
and Lectures will present Amer-
ican pianist, Malcolm Frager in a 
recital of 18th and 19th century 
keyboard music on Friday. Nov-
ember 15 at 8:30 p.m. in Sher-
wood Hall. 

Since 1959, when he won the 
Edgar M. Leventritt Award, Mr. 
Frager has received nothing but 
praise in his impressive career. 
This success was followed in 1960 
by First Prize in the Queen 
Elisabeth of Belgium Competi-
tion. Time Magazine call them 
"the two toughest competitions in 
music." Malcolm Frager is the 
only pianist who has won them 
both. 

At home, the esteem in whicb 
he is held is exempliIied by a 
distinguished list of engagement! 
which includes a command per· 
formance at the White House, th( 
inaugural performance oUhe New 
York Philharmonic at Lincoln 
Center and appearances with the 
Boston Symphony Orchestra at 
Tanglewood for six consecutive 
;ummers. 

Mr. Frager's program w1l1 
:onsist of the Sonata No. 37 in 
) major by Haydn; the Sonata 
.n F minor, Op. 57, II Appas-
sionata," by Beethoven; Moments 
Musicaux Nos. 2, 3, and 4 from 
Op. 94 by Schubert and the Etudes 
Symphoniques, Op. 13 by Robert 
Schumann. 

Tickets are available in the 
Arts and Lectures OUice, Urey 
Hall, Revelle College. Reserved 
s(jating is $ 3.00; UC80 Students, 
$1 .00. 

Since receiving these presti-
gious awards, Mr. Frager bas 
won a world-wide following. He 
has toured the Soviet Union (25 
concerts with standing ovations), 
17 countries in Europe and 9 in 
South America.

Larry Shaw, age 18, is a fresh-

oboist. He plays so well that 
he will be first · oboe player in 
the La Jolla Civic Orchestra for 
the concert on Sunday evening, 
November 10, at Sherwood Hall 
in La Jolla. 

The oboe is pecullar. Com-

of the audience than is any other 
player in the orchestra. That 
is why the first oboist is the 
highest-paid in mosl professional 
symphonies. He usually com-
mands a higher salary than does 
the concertmaster. 

But that doesn't influence 
Larry. Although his oboe play-
ing sounds like that of a pro-
fessional it is really just a hobby 
to him. Larry Isn't going to be 
a professional musician. He is 
going to be a scientist. 

To Larry, music is -just a 
fun thing.· And like most of 
us, he usually is ready and wil-
ling for more fun. So if you 
need an oboe player for a cham-
ber music session, and if some-
one who is coming to that ses-
sion lives near UCSD, tell that 
person to pick up Larry enroute. 
Make advance arrangements by 
calling 453-4164. 

But don't schedule your own 
session for the evening of No-
vember 10. That is your date 
to be at She rwood Hall to hear 
the sound of that tirst oboe ir 
concert with the rest of thf 
orchestra. UCSD students witl 
student body cards will be ad· 
mitted to the concert free.

EI Teatro Campesino 
El Teatro Campesino (the 

Farmworders' Theatre) is com-
ing to UCSD, Friday, Nov. 15, 
to present -The Shrunken Head 
of Pancho Villa, 'written and di-
rected by 27-year-old Luis Val-
des, the group's founder who 
calls El Teatro, -a cross be-
tween Brecht and Cantinflas." 

El Teatro Campesino rose out 
of the Delano, Calif., grape-
pickers' strike that began in 
September, 1965. 

Since October of that year, 
the player-workers of El Teatro 
have performed their songs and 
skits (actos) in fields, in labor 
camps, at union meetings, and to 
publicize the cause, all across 
the country for such diverse 
audiences as the Newport Folk 
Festival and the Senate Subcom-
mittee on Migratory Labor, which 
has been considering an exten-
sion of the National Labor Re-
lations Act to include farm wor-
kers 

In 1968, El Teatro received an 
Oble award ~for creating a wor-
lers' theatre to demonstrate the 
politiCS of survival. " 

In the field, El Teatro plays 
directly to the workers, frequent-
ly from the back of a truck with 
nothing but the strike symbol, 
a black thunderbird in a white 
circle on a red field, for a back-
drop. 

The group employs a simple, 
stark, unmistakable dramatic 
line that is worked out among the 
actors. The dialogue is acrack-
ling series of oral captions, pun-
gent and often funny in its lack 

Dramatizing the lives and 
problems of the workers, the 
skits are performed with an ar-
dent sometimes grim gaiety by 
young people, mostly Mexican, 
full of racial pride, social and 
political fervor, who -wiUconsi-

UBelle" is Interesting 
by Dave Sacherman 

Rebel director Luis Bunel's 
strange form of cinema is gen-
erally concerned with religion, 
decay, and morbid eroticism. 

In his first color work, "Belle 
de Jour", this master of thE 
obscure deals with the thin linE 
between reality and dreams am 
between sanity and madness. In-
deed, the Une seems so thin that 
audiences often cannot tell which 
scenes ' are real and which are 
fantasy. 

The story (told in French and 
subtitled) concerns Severine, an 
unhappy wife portrayed by the 
extraordinarily beautiful Cather-
ine Deneuve, who indulges in 
masochistic sexual fantasies. E-
ventually through a series of 
clues dropped by friends, she 
finds an expensive brothel in 

which to work during afternoons 
until 5:00 (thus the title "Day 
Girl" or "Beauty of the Day"). 

We are humorously presented 
with a series of Severine's 
strange clients amid her bizarre 
dream sequences, and we cannot 
even be certain if the tragic 
aftermath of her activities is 
imagined or real. 

"Belle de Jour". sensitively 
made with a great deal of good 
taste, is a fascinating film, photo-
graphed with a rich cast and 
some striking fashions designed 
by Saint-Laurent. 

However, the film seems to 
fall far short of being an im-
pressive, compelling tableau 01 
erotica. It is merely a puzzUng 
review of Severine's fantasy 
world and her search for di-
version.

I A. S.&nate Notes' I' 
. by Jeff Brittain 

On November 5th, Election Day, the A.S. Senate met brlefiy (40 
minutes) to hear the following reports and to consider the following 
measures: 

An SDS representative present at the meeting listed tbe programs 
that SDS Is putting into effect for the upcoming Regents' meeting 
(Nov. 22). They include a daily leaflet series to inform the students 
of the issues facing them and to discuss the Regents as people in tbe 
academic community. This will enable the students to take an educated 
stand on what can and will happen' when Ronnie, Max, and company 
bring their monthly attempt to destroy academic freedom at UC. 

A rally is planned for November 13th dealing with the Berkeley 
situation and the part that UCSD has in the fight up north which in-
volves Eldridge Cleaver and SA 139X. The Center for Participant 
Education is sending several of their people to UCSD to speak on 
the students' involvement in the class situation in the university and 
the content of those classes. The question of whether the students 
have any say in the course offerings at UCSD will be discussed in 
depth, utilizing faculty-student dialogues. 

There will also be a Rally on Nov. 20th to take up the question of 
for the 21st and 22nd. All of these events call for total UC and state 
college partiCipation in the work to be done to eliminate the causes of 
the problems facing college students today. 

As of yet there is no concrete ASUC80 program involving the 
Regents' meeting but 80S has the backing of the Senate as far as the 
non-violence of that organization's programs goes. Financial assis-
tance in carrying out these programs may be forthcoming. 

The A.S. student directories will be ready soon and will cost the 
monstrously extravagent sum of 25~, which is only 50% of what 
last year's Beagle directory cost. 

The Lectures committee reported that the first of its new series 
of events will be on Nov. 12th with Chancellor McGill speaking on the 
role of the university in the community. Other lectures will be on the 
et hics of scientists, featuring four members of the UCSD scientific 
community; Drs. Saltman and Rappaport and Messers. John Garland 
and John Stull on UC's responsibilities to aocIin the community; and 
dialogues with politically connected stUdents on the role of the univer 
sit y as an agent for revolutionary changes. 

There will be no roof over the Coffee Hut, with the monies to be used 
for the proposed student center in Blake Hall. The Coffee Hut fire-
place will be in Saturday. 

Senator Bill Eastman's proposals on the use of the stage were 
passed. There will be a $12 set-up maintenance, and take-down fee 
charged to all who use the stage plus a $38 tee Cor all non- or oIC-
campus groups using the stage. The latter fee will be terminated 
when $1520 has been raised from use of the portable stage to pay back 
the original investment of $1520. 

President Tom Shepard reported on tbe rapid transit diUiculties 
at UCSD. The San Diego Rapid Transit company service up here has 
been loosing money lately due to lack of student passengers. The campus 
buo; system is suspended into La Jolla due to the competition it gives 
to the public system. $500 was approprlated to purchase 2000 bus 
tokens at 25~ apiece from the bus company. They will be sold at 
6 for $1.00 with a seventh token free. The possibilities of free rides 
into La Jolla for students on weekends was discussed, alter which 
the meeting was adjourned so that everyone could watch Mr. Nixon 
win the election at the various parties throughout the university 
community. 

The Culinary Co-op met Tuesday at 5 p.m. in Mr. Bill Brosari's 
oUice in Building 412 on the Muir Campus (weekly time and meeting 
place) and discussed both some committee and administrative matters 
and some campus projects now underway. 

Under administrative matters discussed were the following: the 
establishment of the posts of vice-chairman and secretary within 
the committee, necessary because of expanding operations of the com-
mittee and the need for more representatives from each campus. 

The amount of work to be done in the committee is growing so we' 
are urging sludents interested in working on the committee to contact 
either Trish Cunningham oC Muir College at 453-2283 or Paul Ricks 
of Revelle College at 755-8028, or to attend next Tuesday's meeting at 
the time and place given above. 

Under Campus projects were discussed the efforts being made by 
Larry Beller and Dave Warburton to compile data concerning student 
expenditure for meals per week in order to expedite a more workable 
meal ticket plan for next quarter' and efforts being made by Sue Halfon 
and Trish Cunningham to collect the missing silverware which you 
students made ready for return after our aweal in last week 's Senate 
Notes.

The ' Revelle College Govern-
ment was called to order on 
Tuesday in the conference room 
of Blake Hall by Tom Baer. 
The minutes were approved and 
old business was iaken up. The 
main topics for discussion were 
1) the interim before the Free 
Speech Board is officially cons-
tituted and permanent amplifi-
cation equipment for the plaza 
procured, 2) the Revelle College 

. jud1c.1al Committee's rules, and 
3) the sending of representatives 
to an inter-campus conference 
at UC Davis. 

TNe has recently used ampli-
fication equipment on the plaza 
in conflict with the rules for this 
and without an attempt to obtain 
permission throurh proper chan-
nels. A motion was defeated to 
make an exception for TNC this 
time. 

The council took some immed-
iate steps in this field. The 
Sub-committe on Revelle Plaza 
was, in effect, made the Free 
Speech Board until such a board 
is constituted. Forms for the 
use of amplification equipment 
on the plaza have regulations 
for that use printed on the re-
verse, side, and are available in

The Faculty of the UC80 Vi-
sual Arts Department will chal-
lenge the limits of Art in its new 
exhibit which opens today, Fri-
day, November 8, atthe Matthews 
Campus Art Gallery. 

Art Gallery Director, David 
Antin has brought together works 
by seven members of the faculty 
which reflect the varying inter· 
ests and attitudes of each artist. 

Visual Art department Chair-
man Paul Brach will be repre-
sented by a collection of Litho-
graphs. These graphic images 
were done in relation to a text 
and work with the marginal visi-
bility of blacks and silver-greys 
in combination. These litho-
graphs are earlier stages of Mr. 
Brach's present work which are 
now being shown at the Cornby 
Gallery in ~ew York City, 

Abstract painter Miriam 
Shapiro works with totaUy flat 
surfaces which present contra-
dictory signals of deep space to 
the viewers. They suggest per-
spective with deliberate incon-
sistencies and explore the view-
er's ability to ass imilate visual 
signals. 

John Baldessaries work re-
presents two types otapproaches. 
The first makes use of photo-
graphed images developed on the 
surface of the painting itself. 
The choice of image and qual-
ity of development seem to be 
deliberate violations of conven-
tional aesthetic considerations. 
At the same time the surface 
seems to be treated with great 
aesthetic concern. The second 
set are purely verbal paintings 
which have a similar· paradoxi-
cal nature. They seem to be 
totally devoid of image and yet 
the isolation of verbal mater-

ial on the canvas sets up an 
image space albeit difficult to 
locate. 

Harold Cohen's paintings are 
manuevers of a ground color and 
repeated abstract image which 
interact with the viewer's eye 
in the most complicated of ways. 
Each painting in the series re-
presents various color relation-
ships; variations on a theme. 

Sculptor Mike Todd has con-
structed a group of woodand me-
tal studies in disequilibria. 
These forms, constructed in a 
variety of combinations of cyl-
inders , discs , and squares , are 
produced by leaning the various 
shapes in different ways , each 
shifting the gravity oC the wor k. 

Artist Don Lewallen 's work is 
represented by a painting which 
deals with the systematic use 
of value gradations of black and 
white. Together the blacks and 
whites create a fascinating s il-
very tone in the work. 

The incompetancy of American 
technology is shown in the work 
of Newton Harrison. Originally 
planned to be displayed in the 
outer areas of the gallery, the 
glue used to put the parts of the 
sculpture together, which was 
speciftcally guaranteed by the 
manufacturer to be weather-
proof, proved faulty and the 
pieces had to be moved indoors . 
Mr. Harrison's work is a series 
of large abstract sculptured 
forms conceived Crom actual 
highway construction parts. Ex-
hibited in a variety of ways, the 
six original pieces , constructed 
out of altered material (a mar-
belized formica), remain related 
to highway construction form s. 
The Art Gallery is open Wed-
nesday through Sunday, 11·4 p.m.

RaNI on Sports 
Spirit-Part Two 

by Larry Raful 
It wasn't all that bad, now was 

it? As a matter of fact, you 
enjoyed yourself didn't you? 

The football game last Sat-
urday was exciting enough even 
to yell for the team. I hate · 
to say "I told you so", but I 
told you so. 

The crowd was excellent on 
Saturday, and except for the wind, . 
it was really a. nice day. The 
addition of cheerleaders added an 
interesting, and sometimes hu-
morous, touch to the game. And 
the football team really looked 
good. 

Unfortunately, Cal Western 
was as tough as they were sup-
posed to be. But the Improve-
ment was very noticeable: the 
s moother play in the offensive 
backfield, the tighter pass cover-
age on defense, and the evolu-
tion of a tough front four on the 
defensive line. 

The offensive line stU! needs 
more work, but you must remem-
ber that some of the players 
are going both ways, and I would 
imagine they start to get tired 
around the third quarter. 

But I don' t want to report on 
the game. I want to prove my 
point from last week's column 
which I believe was proven last 
Saturday. When everyone was 
yelling as a Cal Western punt 
was returned for a UCSD touch-
down, the students and faculty 
in the stands seemed to feel 
somewhat unified. This sense 
of unity is an important ingre-
dient in campus life. 

The cheerleaders certainly 
helped. Their "trial run" was 
a success, and by smoothing off 
some rough edges, they will be 
a real asset to UCSD's athletic 
teams. Between listening to the I 
cheerleaders trying to spell 
UCSD, and laughing as "Heavy" 
tried to sell popcorn, an atmos-

ReG 
( Cont'd from p. 5 ) . 

The Sub-committee on the Re-
velle College Judicial Commit-
tee gave its report. This amend-
ment to point 10 was adopted: 
• All bearings are open, except 
that: 1) They may be closed at 
the request of the accused stu-
dent, and 2) An observer may 
be required to leave if his con-
duct, in the judgment of the 
Committee, is disrupting· 

This judicial committee would 
have the power to review deci-
sions of lower judicial bodies 
but not to change those deci-
sions except under appeal pro-
ceedings. Dean Hull remarked 
that prosecutors from the Re-
gent's couDcll might be used in 
controversial trials of signifi-
cance to the university system. 

The Revelle College Govern-
ment allocated ninety dollars for 
transportation to and registra-
tion for the UC Davis conference 
if Muir does ·not send one 
of the two representatives. An-
other two delegates are being sent 
by the Resdience Halls of Re-
velle. 

A committee to study the re-
IaUon between the members of 
tbe Revelle Collece Government 
and tbe Inter-Hall CoIIDCU was 
formed. 

poore was created in the stands 
that made it worth going to the 
game. And as I said before, 
there was a definite unity among 
the UCSD fans, faculty and stu-
dents alike. 

But where do we go from here? 
That was our last home game 
and it is hard for many of us 
to travel to away games. The 
soccer team has their last home 
game here tomorrow against Cal 
Poly at Pomona, and the water 
polo team likewise has only one 
home game left (Nov. 16, against 
Cal Tech). The varsity cross 
country team doesn't have any 
more meets at home although the 
"B' team has two meets here 
on Nov. 23 and 26. 

This doesn 't mean the fall sea-
son is over. The cross country 
team will be a strong contender 
at the All Cal meet Dec. 7 
in Santa Barbara and the soccer 
team has regional playoffs com-
ing up on Nov. 13 and 16. The 
water polo team has two more 
games , and the always improving 
football team has three games 
left. 

But let's face it; it is hard 
to get to the away games, and 
once in a while we all must 
study a bit on weekends. So 
realistically, I am looking for-
ward to the winter sports season 
to provide a real chance for a 
unified show of support for our 
teams. . 

Heading this list is basketball 
and wrestling. First of all, 
UCSD's team s in these sports 
will be strong. Secondly, both 
these sports are the kind that 
generate real excitement and · 
provide fast action. There is 
nothing better during a winter 
Friday or Saturday night than 
watching a bas ketball game come 
down to the las t two seconds 
and win on a fa s t break or having 
the score tied going into the 
last match of a wrestling match. 

The teams are getting ready, 
and so are the cheerleaders . 
so you get ready, too, to support 
the winter athletic teams. The 
best is yet to come!!!

Westerners, 34-7 
by Dave Warburton 

Tulita Kuchin's Black m team 
defeated Polly Blackburn's Dis-

with the Annies scored a 15-
3 victory over Kathy Speyer's 
BIake II. 

Women's flag football will get 
under way tomorrow at 10:00 
am. All games will be played 
on the Revelle FLeld. Two games 
will be held each Saturday for 
the next three weeks. 

The only four teams to sign 
up for t his fall are the Buff 

. Eakss, London Phrog, T.G.F.T. 
and Blake II. Come on out 
and cheer the girls on. 

Handball and tennis will be in 
progress by next week. Volley-
ball for men is aiready in its 
fourth day. 

Tennis has 24 contestants 
signed up and should be under 

, way today. Handball began yes-
terday with 11 contestants. 

Men' s flag football is in its 
final week of play, and from 
all indications it looks like there 
will be some real competition 
for the intramural championship. 

BOI of A league has completed 
their schedule without a single 
defeat. Second place Ln A league 
will probably go to Argo V if 
they get by the Plastic Machine 
on MOnday. 

In league competition, the Pur-
ple Gophers have a 3-0 record 
and will most likely add two 
more wins to complete their 
season. Maphd will take the 
second spot in B league. 

C league has a three way tie 
with the Greeks, Orange Tide 
and Half- Fast all with 3-1 re-
cords. Perhaps all three will 
be going into the playoUs. 

For all those interested keep 
in mind the cross country tur-
key run, open to all students 
not participating in athletics. 
This event is open to women, 
so if you gals didn't know, sign 
up now through Nov. 20. Come

The fir st three finishers will 
receive a live turkey, duck and

Cross Country Drops. 

The Triton football team re-
turned to action Saturday atter-
noon after two consecutive byes. 
They faced a tougb Cal Wes-
tern team for their homecoming 
game. 

Cal Western won the game 
34-7, but the Tritons surprised 
nearly everyone by making It 
a close contest for three quar-
ters. The superior bench strength 
of the Westerners was finally 
able to wear down the Tritons 
in the fourth quarter. 

The Tritons scored first after 
John Ringwood returned a wind 
aided seventy-yard Cal Western 
punt eighty yards to the Wes-
terners five yard line. Greg 
Gleason scored the touchdown 
from the two yard line. Randy 
Herman kicked the extra point 
to make it 7-0. 

Cal Western received the kick-
off and marched sixty yards in 
nine plays. Bill Nugent scored 
the touchdown on a two yard run. 
Dale Curtis kicked the extra point 
to tie the score. 

The Westerners scored again 
at the beginning of the second 
quarter on another two yard run 
by Nugent. Curtis kicked the 
extra point to give the Westerners 
a 14-7 lead. The Triton defense, 
aided by a Dan Mikels inter-
ception, held fo r the rest of 
the quarter and the half ended 
without further scoring. 

The Triton defense continued 
to do a good job in the third 
quarter. The Westerners were 
not able to score ' until the end 
of the quarter. 

A blocked Triton punt gave 
the Westerners the ball on the 
UCSD three yard line. Mike 
Bielman carried the ball in for 
Cal Western. Curtis kicked the 
extra point to make it 21-7. 

. Earlier in the quarter Ed Couv-
rette, Triton guard, scooped upa 
Triton fumble and gained four 
yards to deny the Westerners 
another scoring opportunity. 

In the fourth quarter the Cal 
Western manpower advantage 

finally showed itself. The Tri-
tons had five or six men play-
ing both ways most of the game. 
Atter wearing the Tritons down 
for three quarters, the Western-
ers were able to score two 
touchdowns. 

Eric Widmar scored on a fltty 
eight yard pass from Clark with 
Curtis kicking the extra point 
to make it 28-7. Near the end

UCSD's Jay Segal finished third 
behind two Cal Poly runners. 

Unfortunately official meet sta-
tictics and scoring are unavail-
able as this article goes to print. 

To show the stl!fness of the 
competition in the univers ity and 
open division (which was run 
jointly with the college division), 
Jay Segal was 28th in the com-
bined race, and third in the col-
lege division.

terners. Cal Western is prob-
ably the best team the Tritons 
have faced but they weren't able 
to annilate the Tritons as many 
had feared might happen. They 
never succeeded in even embar-

as~!ng UCSD. 

Much of the credit has to go 
to the defensive unit. Coach Hac-
kett praised the entire defensive 
line, consisting of Bill Faddis 
LT, Mike Fagan LG, Ed Couv-
rette RG, and Bob Dosh RT. 

Coach Hackett said the right 
and lett cornerbacks, Manuel My-
ers and Mike Heredla, did a 
very good job in containing the 
outside plays. Alan Dwyer did 
his usual good job at middle 
linebacker. 

On offense Coach Hackett said 
both Belton Flournoy FB and 
Greg Gleason QB did a good 
job. Although Gleason completed 
only five passes he had several 
well-thrown passes dropped. The 
Cal Western line managed to 
keep heavy pressure on Gleason 
most of the atternoon. 

The Tritons next game is to-
morrow against Cal Tech. The 
game will be held up there, and 
will start at 2:00 p.m.

to me that there are a myriad 
of other topics which could be 
discussed and which are equally

might be on congenial things like

correct. It is precisely because 
of the Intern.ational Olympic I

How much control over the ' 
individual does a government of 
the people have a moral right 
to extend? Must there be a 
change in the basic mores of 
society before human beings can 
exist as human beings?
