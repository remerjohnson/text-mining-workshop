Screening for UC 
Employees Tightened 

By REBEKAH YOUNG and 
JILL COLLEY 
SIa!! Writers 

In a move that has received 
mixed reactions from UCSD 
employers, the UC system i 
attempting to tighten up the 
screening process required for 
employment in positions consi-
dered "sensitive." 

The new screening process will 
involve "more than the normal 
background check" on people 
applying for or being promoted 
to these sensitive positions, Archie 
Garcia, assistant personnel man-
ager for the UCSD Personnel 
Office, said. 

These positions include jobs in 
which employee·s have access to 
master keys to on-campus resi-
dences and University buildings. 
Other jobs considered "sensitive" 
involve those handling cash, con-
trolled substances (for example, 
.pharmaceutical drugs), and child 
care. 

According to Gerry Reid, 
manager of compensation and 
policy at the UCSD Personnel 
Office, the more extensive back-
ground checks will include con-
firmation of previous employ-
ment, verification of references, a 
credit history check, and a check 
for a history of any prevIOus 
involvement in lawsuits, court 

actions and convictions, but not 
arrests. 

Arrest records will not be 
checked because "an arre t doesn't 
mean you've been convicted of a 
crime; it doesn't mean you're 
guilty," Garcia said. 

Previous employment will be 
verified to make sure employees 
possess the skills their job at 
UCSD requires, Garcia added. 

Also under consideration is the 
verification of prior work per-
formance and regulation finger-
printing. 

The screening process will not 
include a lie detector or drug test, 
and the checks will apply to stu-
dents who hold these positions as 
weil as to non-students. 

Key administrators here were 
asked by the University of Cali-
fornia Office of the President 
(UCOP) to comment on the pro-
posed policy of strengthened 
bKksround checks as --.en as 
compile a list of positions UCSD 
should designate as "sensitive." 
Administrators were also asked 
to incidate the level of background 
checks ·recommended for the 
positions. 

The Personnel Office, now in 
the process of compiling the data, 
will submit the information to the 
UCOP. The UCOP is attempting 
to "standardize the approach UC 
campuses take" when researching

Murder Hearing Begins 
For Med. School Student 

By SETH SLATER 
News Editor 

Winegar said he examined the 
body with a stethoscope but found 
neither heartbeat nor respiration. 
At that point , the doctor said, the 
body was "cold and stiff" and he 
pronounced Beth Richardson 
dead. 

Sharks Attack Two UCLA Kayakers 

The district attorney's case 
against UCSD Medical School 
student Charlie Richard on, ac-
cused of murdering his wife, began 
to take shape Friday at the open-
ing of Richardson' preliminary 
hearing in a San Diego municipal 
court. 

According to a report filed by 
Deputy Coroner Penelope Ham-
merstead , the autopsy performed 
on Beth Richardson's body re-
vealed that she had been "stran-
gled by another person." 

LOS A NGE LES - The U.S. 
Coa t Guard ended a four-day 
search last Wednesday for Roy 
Jeffrey Stoddard, a UCLA grad-
uate student missing since a shark 
attack the preceding Thursday 
that killed his girlfriend, UCLA 
graduate student Tamara Mc-
Allister. 

McAllister's body, riddled with 
shark bites, was found on Satur-
day, Jan. 28, floating in the Pacific 
five miles off Point Mugu. Stod-
dard and McAllister had set off 
on a kaya king trip from Malibu 
Beach two days earlier. Their 
kayaks were discovered off Point 
Mugu on riday, Jan. 27. 

"The probability of finding a 
urvivor at this point i minimal ," 

Petty Officer Robert Beals said 
la t Thursday. 

The attac k "was a freak thing, ... 
Ventura C unty Deputy Coroner 
Jim Wingate said, "and overreact-
ing now wouldn't serve any pur-
pose." 

"We don't want to start a 
panic," he added. 

Stoddard , 24, was a teaching 
a i tant f r Pu blic Health 112, 
an upper-divis ion cour e in 
epidemiol g} . McAllister, also 24 
and a graduate tudent of public 
health, wa!> d !>tudent in hi section. 

hark e pel t John Mc 0 ker, 
director of San Fran isco's Stein-

hart Aquarium, described the 
attack a a "classic white shark 
cenario." 

"If this was, in fact , a Great 
White attack , it would be the first 
that we know of occurring south 
of Santa Barbara," McCosker 
said. 

There have only been six other 
fatal shark attacks in California 
in the past 63 years. According to 
an Associated Press report, author-
ities have not closed the beache 
in areas near the attack for fear of 
causing a panic over a single 
incident. 

Zuma Beach lifeguard John 
Baker said that Latigo Point, the 
area where the kayaking trip 
began, is not currently overseen 
by lifeguard . 

Stoddard and McAllister were 
both described as responsible 
individuals and their absences 
were noticed immediately, co-
workers said. 

McAllister and Stoddard had 
been mis ing since the morning of 
Thursday, Jan . 26. Their absen-
ce were noticed at that time when 
Stoddard failed to proctor an 
e am and McAlIi ter did not 
report for her job a a part-time 
lab assi ·tant. '

According to the testimony of 
biology technician Azita Moalemi, 
who worked under the upervi-
sion of the defendant's wife at EI 
Cajon Incorporated Laboratory, 
the body of Maria Elizabeth 
Richardson wa found in the lab. 
on the morning of Dec. 20 last 
year. 

Moalemi said he arrived at 
work that morning to find that 
"the lights were on in the other 
rooms," and he "thought that 
maybe Beth [Richardson] was in." 

Upon entering the lab's hema-
tology office, Moalemi said she 
found her supervisor's body face 
down on the floor and proceeded 
to "touch her with my leg," and 
call Beth's name before seeking 
help from a neighboring doctor's 
office. 

Family physician Terry L. Wine-
gar said that when Moalemi told 
him that Beth Richard on was on 
the floor in the lab, he hurried 
next door thinking that Beth had 
fallen and cut her elf. 

"When I walked into the room, 
the door was ... about half way

According to the testimony of

ed as the Richardsons' babysitter

lie Richard on left their home 
together the day Beth's body was 
found . 

"They were kind of happy,'" 
Mabalot said through court trans-
lator Ernie Flore , Jr., "and I 
accompanied them outside," to 
their car. 

Mabalot further testified that 
in the months preceding Beth 
Richardson's death, she and her 
husband had argued on a number 
of occasions. 

She added, though, that she 
recognized photos presented to 
her during the court proceedings 
as including ones of pieces of 
paper with the words "'love you" 
and "I love you very much"which 
Mabalot identified as being sam-
ples of Charlie Richardson's pen-
manship.

U C Berkeley Lecturer Mixed-up 
in Plane Bomb Hoax 

LOS ANGELES - Hunting for a job can be diffi-
cult, especially if you're Peter Canning. He was 
arrested by the FBI while trying. 

Canning, a visiting lecturer at UC Berkeley. w~s on 
a flight to New Orleans, where he had scheduled Job 
interviews. But during the flight, Canning got mixed 
up in a bomb hoax that put his life on hold for five 
days. 

While on the plane, he found a note tucked in a 
meal tray. The note said in pan, "There are bombs 
planted all over this airplane." But when he handed it 
over to the flight crew, the 'plane made an emergency 
landing. Canning, suspected as a terrorist, was 
arrested. 

Investigation and interrogation followed . The 
result : the 40-year-old scholar of comparative litera-
ture was mistakenly accused of composing a note 
actually scribbled by an imaginative Il-year-old boy. 
The FBI apologized and Canning was cleared of 
charges. 

"I'm just relieved it's over," Canning said in a tele-
phone interview from his home in Berkeley. However, 
he still has some unexpected bills and an unrefunded 
ticket. 

Canning has rescheduled the interviews he was not 
able to keep, and he hopes to find a teaching job 
before his two-year contract with Berkeley expires. 
His last semester teaching at Berkeley tans Monday.

Academic Senate Investigates 
UCD Profs $7 Million Lawsuit 

LOS ANG ELES - A $7-million lawsuit against 
two UC Davis professors and an employee prompted 
a state-wide academic senate committee to re~xamine 
University policy and seek changes Wednesday, Jan. 
18. 

The lawsuit's outcome raised questions about Uni-
versity policy on faculty research, and to what extent 
the University will pay for damages. The unanswered 
questions are causing an uneasy stir among faculty 
and the Academic Senate. 

The suit was filed in 1979 by George Neary, a Davis 
cattle rancher. Neary claimed that an investigative 
report by two UC Davis profes~ors , Ben Norman and 
Charles Hjerpe, had defamed him. 

Neary, the California Department of Food and 
Agriculture (CDFA). and an a.s emblym~~ had ~sked 
the UC Davis School of Vetennar MediCine to inves-
tigate how a large number of 'eary's cows died . 

eary claimed that toxaphene sprayi~g by th.e CD.FA 
killed the cows, and wanted UC DaVIS to venfy thiS. 

But when the professors concluded in their study 
that Neary's own mismanagement killed the cows, 
Neary claimed that the report was false . He said that 
Norman and Hjerpe were partial to pesticide spraying 
and had friends in the CDFA. 

The jury's verdict found the professors and one 
administrator guilty and awarded Neary $7 million on 
Sept. 8. 

As a matter of policy, the ~niversity will pay the $7 
million award which was for general damages only. 
The University is seeking an appeal to reduce Neary's 
award, but Neary may still sue for punitive damages. 

Although no punitive damages have been ~warded 
in Neary's case, faculty members are wondenng 
whether the University would pay for such damages. 

The existing UC policy requires the University to 
conduct an independent post-trial investigation to 
determine if the school will pay. This is to protec~ the 
University in cases in which the professor acted With 
malice. 

No decisions have been made as to what specific 
changes will be made in University policy.. .

Turkish Paper Falsely Reports 
Firing of UCLA Professor 

LOS ANGELES - A recent article in Turkey's 
largest newspaper, Hurriyet, reported that UCLA 
professor Stanford Shaw said he had been fired 
because of Armenian pressure. 

But Shaw, a senior professor at UCLA for more 
than 20 years, has never been fired and is still teaching 
Ottoman history here. • 

Currently the target of an undergraduate govern-
ment task force investigating his scholarly practices, 
the professor has been accused of poor research 
because he claims the Turkish government slaught-
ered no Armenians in 1915. 

The task force is the second to investigate Shaw 
this year. The first group's report - prompted when 
the Armenian Student Association accused Shaw of 
poor scholarhsip last summer - was considered 
biased and inspired the second investigaion. 

The article in Hurriyet , which has a circulation of 
800,000 in Turkey and also prints European and 
American editions, went on to say that Shaw had 
requested a letter-writing campaign supporting his 
reinstatement.

through the credit union's office on Gilman Drive. 

The service is staffed with experienced tax 
professionals who are prepared to handle any level of 
tax return. The member-owned cooperative has kept 
the fees low, according to the service rendered. 

U.S.E.'s tax preparation specialists are available by 
appointment Monday ~hrough Friday from 9 a.m. to 
5 p.m. Starting Feb. 1 through April 17, those hours 
will be extended from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays,

UCSD Lit Prof Donald Wayne 

Literature professor Donald Wayne will give the 
second of three "salons" sponsored by the Friends of 
the UCSD Library at 5 p.m., Tuesday, Feb. 7, in 
room 263 of the Central Library. 

Wayne's topic will be "Power, Politics, and 
Renaissance Culture: The Case of Ben Jonson." 
Admission is free and the public is welcome. 

Wayne will frame a discussion of the work of the 
17th century poet and playwright Ben Jonson within 
a broader set of questions concerning the tendency of 
20th century aesthetics to separate, if not to exclude, 
issues of political and social history from the study 
and appreciation of art and literature. 

Those planning to attend the salon ma~ wish to read 
Jonson's "Volpone" in advance. Further information

LJ Committee Rejects 
Traffic Recommendations 
By LA.URA PROCTOR 
Senior Staff Writer 

If the recommendations of a 
recent traffic study are followed, 
La 10lla will see several "improve-
ment strategies" implemented, 
including a new overpass over 
Ardath Road, a stoplight on 
Prospect street, a switch to one-
way streets and the elimination of 
parking on Torrey Pines Road. 

At a meeting last week of the 
La 10lla Town Council's Traffic 
and Transportation Committee, 
most members strongly opposed 
the recommendations of the firm 
which prepared the study. 

The La Jolla meeting focused 
on the importance of pedestrian 
safety, maintaining "village am-
biance," and preventing the con-
struction of "a highway through 
La Jolla." 

The study in question, called 
the Beach Communities Traffic 
Congestion Study, was prepared 
by JHK and Associates. Accord-
ing to its executive summary, it 
was conducted "on the behalf of 
the City of San Diego and the 
residents of the Pacific Beach and 
La Jolla Communities . . . to alle-
viate the high level of congestion 
that currently exists during peak 
periods ." 

At its meeting last week, the 
Town Concil committee revised 

its proposed response to the study, 
to be included with the report 
when the study is brought before 
the San Diego City Council. 

This response would represent 
the opinion of the La Jolla Town 
Council, the La 10lla Community 
Planning Association, and the the 
La Jolla Shores Association. 

The proposed response is a 
rejection if the study's recom-
mendations because they would 
"violate the La Jolla Community 
Plan by turning our village streets 
into a neighborhood-destroying 
highway," one committee member 
said. 

Dave Ish, manager of the La 
Jolla Town Council, said it is 
unlikekly that the San Diego City 
Council will blindly follow the 
recommendations if La Jolla 
opposes them. 

"[The City Council is usually] 
very open to and interested in the 
community's attitude," he said. 

Ish explained that the study 
emphasized alleviation of traffic 
problems through road expan-
sion, but ignored community 
concerns. 

"It's frustrating," he said . "You 
have to be willing to stand up." 

Ish called the Community Plan 
"the overall document of what La 
Jolla should be,;' and said, "We've 
had some problems [in the past] 
with the city adhering to that 
plan." 

NEWS 
The plan, devised in 1976, states 

that "anything that is done to 
encourage and make more con-
venient the private automobile 
will be a detriment." 

The proposed La Jolla response 
objects to an Ardath overpass 
because it would encourage traf-
fic to move to and from La Jolla 
via Mount Soledad Park. Also, a 
stoplight at Girard and Prospect, 
it says, would "destroy village 
ambiance" and one-way streets, 
it states, should be considered 
only on a case-by-case basis. 

The response also opposes the 
recommendation to add more 
traffic lanes on Torrey Pines Road 
on the grounds that this would 
increase speeding and danger to 
bicyclists while eliminating "al-
ready scarce" parking. 

Dan Allen, a Town Council 
trustee, objected to the commit-
tee's narrow view on road expan-
sion. He claimed that the mem-
bers' opinions did not represent 
the entire La Jolla community. If 
the council keeps rejecting all 
recommendations for expansion, 
he said, "Five years from now 
we're going to be in the worst 
gridlock you've ever seen." 

Council President Rob Whit-
temore disagreed, saying, .. 'We 
don't want a highway going 
through La Jolla' - That's the 
overall sentiment [in the com-
munity). " 

According to Whittemore, the 
consensus in La Jolla is, "We'd 
rather sit in traffic than have a big 
highway through La Jolla." 

SCREENIN G: UC To Tighten Checks 
For Employees in 'Sensitive' Positions 
Continued from page I 
of business affairs at UCSD, 
added that background checks 
are done In a "limited way" now, 
and on a "case by case" basis. 
With a new, uniform policy, there 
will be "less flexibility" in decid-
ing whichjobs merit a background 
check. 

The new policies that will be 
handed down by the UCOP will 
define which positions need to be 
checked and to what extent. 

"These positions will be identi-
fied by their responsibilties, not 
by their titles," Garcia stressed . 

Reactions to the policy prop-
osal from key UCSD administra-
tors were "varied," Garcia added. 

Comments included question-
ing how long the new policy would 
delay someone from beginning 
work. Also asked was what action 
an employer would take if a con-
viction was discovered but was in 

no way related to the job. 
Another concern was raised 

regarding the checking of pre-
vious job performance. Adminis-
trators wondered if, when a pre-
vious employer gave personal 
information about a prospective 
employee, that new knowledge 
might influence their decision to 
hire that person. 

Garcia explained that these 
questions fall under "local proce-
dure'; which is still being planned. 

Josephine Foufks, directer of 
the La Barranca Day Care Cen-
ter, said that background checks 
were necessary, "especially in a 
department like ours ." Back-
ground checks are already re-
quired for the licensing agency 
and social services, Foulks added . 
She speculated that the new 
security measures could be a reac-
tion to public pressure stemming 
from the massive publicity child

abuse has been receiving. 
Previously, background checks 

were conducted only after an 
employee's appointment, ndt 
before he or she could be hired . 
The resuks were used to deter-
mine if employment would be

MURDER: Hearing Begins 
Continued from pace 1 

According to Howard, Richard-
son told police investigators that 
he left his wife's workplace at 
approximately 7:45 a.m. that day 
and then spent a couple of hours 
at the UCSD library before run-
ning other errands, including the 
purchase of a potted rose bush for 
his wife. 

The officer testified that Rich-
ardson returned to the EI Cajon 
laboratory shortly after noon on 
Dec. 20. 

Howard acknowledged, in res-
ponse to defense attorney Rick 
Siref's questions, that Richardson 
asked what had happened at the 
lab and inquired as to the whe-
reabouts of his wife, saying that 
the presence of so many police 
cars had given him cause for 
concern. 

When Howard informed Rich-
ardson of his wife's death, he 
"immediately put his hands over 
his face so that they covered his 
eyes," the officer said. Howard 
said that when Richardson re-
moved his hands, his eyes ap-
peared "a little bit"red, but noted 
that he did not cry and com-
mented that "I thought that was 
odd." 

Howard said that he and a 
police agent interviewed Richard-
son for approximately three and a 

half hours and noted that, during 
the first hour, Richardson kept 
moving his hands "in a rubbing 
motion," but remained "calm 
throughout the conversation." 

"[Charlie Richardson] never 
asked how she [Beth Richardson] 
died," Howard said. "At one point 
in the conversation, he asked, 
'Did she fallT " 

According to the officer, Rich-
ardson said that his wife had no 
enemies. 

During the interview, Howard 
said that he observed "a couple of 
scratches on [Richardson's] 
hands." 

When asked about these scratch-
es, Howard said Richardson ex-
plained them to be the result of a 
"tickling" incident with his wife 
earlier that day and said that he 
had not been scratched in any 
other area. 

Apparently, Richardson told 
Howard that he had been kissing 
and tickling his wife prior to leav-

his hands while moving them. 

Howard's testimony, however, 
indicated that there were faint 
scratch marks on Richardson's 
upper chest, forehead, left shoul-
der and on the bridge of his nose. 
Howard said the scratches "were 
red" and "appeared to be fresh ."

Health Center Not Amusing 
The art of medicine consists of amusing the patient while 

nature cures the di ease. - Voltaire 
Voltaire probably would have been amused by the ' tudent 

Health Center, but many students are not. Health care is alwa~s 
important to tudent , who have enough constraints on then 
time, but it is especially crucial this time of the year when we are 
confronted with two evils : the flu and midterms. 

One student went into the Health Center because he thought 
he might have the flu . He was given prescriptions for several 
drugs. This student is from England and is shorl of funds , but he 
had m idterms coming up, so he had the prescriptions filled . 

The next day, he was violently ill. He went back to the center 
a nd they determined that it was the drug that were making him 
vomit. They prescribed some different ones. These did not. ~elp 
much either, and by this time he had spent o ver $50 on medlcme, 
and was still sick . 

Another student went in with a sprained ankle. The nurse 
looked at it , and told him they would X-ray it to make sure it was 
not broken. She said , "Okay, it 's your femur." This student was 
not a biology major, but he was still pretty sure that the femur 
was not near the ankle . This was probably not ignorance on the 
nurse's part, since she realized her error as soon as he pointed it 
out, but it does suggest a carelessness brought on by fatigue or 
apathy. 

A similar case of carelessness was yet another student who 
went in feeling sick, and was given a throat culture and a blood 
test. She was told to call back in a few days for the results. When 
she called back, she was told that the throat culture, blood test 
and urine test all showed she was okay. After she hung up, she 
remembered that she had not given a urine sample. 

Many students who go are not given anything to make them 
feel better. They are just told to.get a lot of rest (not an easy task 
during midterms), drink liquids, and so on. A call to your 
mother could have told you that. 

Sometimes there is little that medicine can do, especially with 
a virus . But this does not excuse the indifference of the workers 
at the Health Center. They should at least heed Voltaire's wry 
advice, and give some comfort. 

T his is all anecdotal evidence, and it is certain that some 
students do get quality care at the Health Center. This is not the 
general impression , however. 

It is difficult to pinpoint the precise problem at the Health 
Center. Health care is expensive , and managing such a center 
presents difficulties . But a good start would be to demand some 
courtesy and thought from the employees . 

Sluggish bureacracy is familiar to UCSD students, but it is 
more intolerable when a student is sick and has three midterms 
the next week . 

Paridnl Not 
Problem 

EdItor. 
I am sick of hearing all of 

theIe complaints about the park-
ing situation here at UCSD. The 
students here do not have a 
parking problem; they have an 
altitude problem. Tiley have be-
come so sati.racd and lazy with 
the luxury of the automobile 
that they believe that asking 
tbem to walk a little or leave 
home a httle earlier is an encroach-
ment on their rishts. 

The most absurd of the com-
plaints is that the University is 
too strict with regulations. Stu-
dents complain that they receive 
too many parking tickets. Well , 
if they had not broken the park-
ing regulations in the first place, 
they would never have gotten 
t he tickets. This complaint is 
just the result of anger on the 

~tude nts' part for having been 
caugh t cheating. 

These students are 100 I8IY to

that the Univcnity ia unfair ia ill 
parking enforcement policy. 

Another ridiculoUi complaint 
UCSD students make about the 
parking is concerned with the 
high price of the pennit. Obvi~ 
ty, the University needs money 
to survive. But the state does not 
provide aU of tbe necessary 
fundi. Therefore, the University 
must find some additional ways 
to raise money. Sellina parkina 
permits ia one ofthese ways. The 
money is inevitably goina to 
have to come from the students, 
in some form of collection or 
other. 

The students should be glad 
that the permits are high priced. 
Instead of charging for the per-
mits , the University couldjust as 
easily add a two-hundred dollar 
surcharge to tuitio n to cover it ~ 
costs, but then the parking itua-
tion would really be a problem.

Students Not 
Apathetic 
Editor: 

Let's give our so called "apa-
thetic" generation a break. Time 
and time again in the classroom 
or in the med ia there is discussion 
about the lack of interest or con-
cern within our generation. Let 
me say, first of all, our generation 
confronts many difficult issues 
that past generations did not. 

We face environmental degra-
dation, AIDS, and greater vio-
lence. We all bear the pressure tb 
be very successful - many must 
deal with the turmoil of a broken 
home - others must finance ever-
increasing educational costs. 

Secondly, many students are 
actively involved in contributing 
to the community by volunteer-
ing their time in hospitals, orphan-
ages, big brother I big sister pro-
grams and other valuable organiza-
tions. 

I resent being labeled apathetic 
and would appreciate some recogni-
tion for the many issues our genera-
tion is being looked to for answers.

Phil's Picks 
Pointless 
Editor: 

This is a bit ridiculous! Phil 
Gruen and his stupid picks are a 
bit much, unless of course you are 
changing your format to that of 
the Koala. 

The choices Phil makes take no 
I.Q. to call at home. 1'1 quote the 
Koala. "The only time I pick 
anything right is when I favor one 
team by 80 points and advise the 
readers to pick the other team." 
This is so true. Unless the game is 
going to be some sort of slaughter, 
forexamp\e, the L.A. Lakers versus 
the Stevie Wonder School for the 
Blind, Phil will rarely attempt it. 

That's not exactly true, he has 
taken a huge bite out of Vegas by 
(obviously) choosing the finishing 
date of Price Center, and whether 
UCSD will get a parking struc-
ture. Get a clue, this isn't sports-
related. Hey - I have a novel idea 
for Phil, while we are on the 
subject, how about: "Will the FAA 
put a runway in my apartment?" 
or even, "Is Disneyland going to 
trade the Matterhorn for the Sun 
God?"; I have enough sense to 
know that he'l hit these right on 
the nose. 

Why can't Phil stick solely to

out of their warm CUI and 
. beds? Hard work dOile 
the ript auitude builds 

cllancter. Many of the student 
here at UCSD could use some 
strona support for their lazy 
characters. 

The solution for finding a 
spot close to class is to come 
early. Waking up early for class 
has its benefits as well . The extra 
time gives the ~ tude nt ' body 
and mind a chance to s hake off 
the dullne s of sleep. The stu-

ports? What's wrong with choos-
ing a winner for UCSD lacrosse, 
tennis, swimming, rugby, and even 
what Phil referred to as "not exci-
ting," fencing. Think about it, 
maybe that will increase sports 
awareness around an academ-
ically oriented campus for these 
other teams. Hell, I didn't even 
realize that there was a fencing 
team until Phil said that he 
wouldn't pick a fencing match. 
Understandably it's probably not 
easy because there's not really a 
spread, but it's sports, not archi-
tecture. 

Even in an instance that there is 
no major sports (i.e. basketball, 
soccer) and this week's pick will 
be between a less popular sport 
and the possibilities of prices at 
Ralph's changing, why can't Phil 
go a bit out on a limb and look 
ahead to the future? For example, 
why can't Phil attempt to choose 
one or two of the Final Four in 
the college basketball champion-
ship? Couldn't the '89 N BA World 
Champs be prophesied? 

I could personally give you an 
opinion upon the NBA, but I'm 
sure Phil's infinite sports wisdom 
(that which is highly associated 
with the Guardian's sports editor) 
could give some sort of insight. It 
doesn't even have to be a sporting 
contest, a newsworthy item deal-
ing with sports would equally suf-

"Uving on the road, my friend; was 
gonna keep you free and clean .. ... 

- Willie Nelson 

The darkness was all around. Through 
it, a tunnel seemed to open up as my high 
beams lit the road ahead; but to the sides 
and behind was only darkness. 

This was not the sort of darknes~that 
you can find near a city, or even near any 
sort of a sizable town. There, the light 
from thousands of homes and other cars 
fills the sky with brilliance, and prevents 
it from ever becoming truly dark. The 
first time I saw San Diego at night from a 
sailboat a few miles offshore, I was 
amazed at how bright the sky above it 
was - and at the darkness of the endless 
ocean in the other direction. 

This time, I was far away from any 
city, or even any other person. There 
were only three sources of light at that 
moment: the headlights, a soft red glow 
from the instruments, and the endless 
array of stars in the sky above. 

When it's really dark, it's amazing how 
many stars you can see. The moon was at 
one of its smallest phases, and didn't put 
out very much light; but the thousands of 
stars in the sky above provided their own 
special exhibition. 

Even though there were patches of 
snow amongst the tufts of scrubby grass 
along the roadside, I opened the sunroof

Driving Life's Lonely Highways cloud that I was in became even more dense, I said to myself, "Wow! This is 
great!" 

for a minute to get the full effect. The 
stars seemed to dominate the scene for a 
moment, putting the Earth into its true 
perspective of only being a speck of dust 
in the universe. The vast plains and the 
black outlines of mountains in the dis-
tance suddenly seemed very small and 
insignificant, and I felt for a moment as 
though I belonged more to the world of 
the stars than to the strip of asphalt along 
which I was traveling. 

This scene is one which I have repeated 
many times o,ver the last few years; a 
lonely highway, late at night, far from 
any other person. I have always traveled 
these roads alone; and I have always 
enjoyed it. This may seem a bit strange, 
but to me, times like these are perhaps the 
only ones when I feel truly at ease with 
myself and the world. 

I'm generally pretty happy with all of 
the different activities, jobs, and studies 
which fill my life here. However, every 
now and then, I find myself longing for 
the open road. Alone out there, my car 
and I seem to form a separate world; 
isolated from all other people, and tied 
instead to the Earth and to the sky. It's 
the one place where I can think things 
through, without the pressure of worry-
ing about the immediate concerns of 
anyone else. 

"Take me home, down country roads . .. 
- John Denver 

My car and I have been through many 
things together, been down many lonely 
roads, and it has hardly ever failed me. I 
drive an ' old (1977) white four-door 
BMW, into which gets poured not only 
money, but large helpings of personal 
care and attention. She's like .!n old 

friend, in some ways one of the best 
friends I've got. 

I've driven her from here to Canada 
twice, and along the back roads of the 
Sierra Nevadaand the coast offar North-
ern California. Often, the excuse I use is a 
ski trip, and while I really love skiing, the 
driving is always a large part of the fun. 

My latest trip, over the winter break, 
took me to Salt Lake City, to North Lake 
Tahoe, then home to the Bay Area and 
finally back to San Diego. My odometer 
turned over 150,000 miles on this trip , 
something I feel strangely proud of . 

For me and myoId car, the challenge 
of the open road is a constant call. I 
remember one trip, when I was returning 
from a ski trip to Bend, in central 
Oregon, a few years back: I went through 
just about every kind of weather possible 
in a single day. It was a very long drive to 
make in one day, but for once I had 
gotten an early start. 

As I buckled my seat belt and gripped 
the steering wheel, it was starting to snow 
heavily, but I wasn't worried. Instead, I 
was actually looking forward to the chal-
lenge. That kind of confidence is a great 
feeling, and it was with a sense of antici-
pation that I set off. . 

The snow lasted for about the first 
hundred miles, with the wind blowing it 
straight into my windshield. Then, as I 
neared the California border, it changed 
to frozen sleet, then to rain. By the time 
the two-lane highway down from Bend 
hit 1-5 north of Mount Shasta, it was 
dark and raining hard. The wind was 
blowing about 40-50 miles per hour as 
the road climbed through the foothills. 
Then, as the rain died down a little, a 
dense fog enveloped everything. As the 
traffic slowed, the wind howled, and the 

"Here's hoping you'll never go astray, 
on life's highway . .. 

- Steve Wariner 

Yes, this crazy person did make it 
home that night without killing himself 
or anyone else. A few weeks later, I 
returned to San Diego: sun, beaches, and 
palm trees. This is a very nice place, but it 
is not all things to all people, and espe-
cially not to me. Laying on a beach in the 
sun may be some people's idea offun, but 
it is not mine. I would rather be driving 
down some lonely highway, or standing 
on a high bluff on the coast offar North-
ern California, watching the angry Pac-
ific pound against jagged rocks. 

I mentioned before that I have always 
gone on these trips of mine alone; I also 
spc;nd much of my time here at school 
alone, and I know that there are others 
on this campus who do the same. Sure, I 
have a few friends , but not many, and not 
ones that I do a great many things with. I 
value my privacy, the control over my 
own life, the freedom which an existence 
largely free from the pressures of others 
gives me. 

However, such an existence also has a 
certain sadness to it. It's not easy to meet 
people on this campus, especially for 
someone who doesn't get that much 
practice meeting people anyway. Com-
plica,ting matters is how this society in 
general does not seem to accept the idea 
of people doing things by themselves. Try 
going to a restaurant or movie alone 
sometime, and you'l know what I'm talk-
ing about. "Just one?" or "Dining alone 
tonight?" are familiar phrases in such 
situations.

Budget Cuts 
Sting 
Editor: 

Last fall , when this year's round 
of federal and state education 
budget cut took hold , many 
UCS D students took a familiar 
route to get tho e much sought-
after lower division math or Eng-
lish courses by attempting to reg-
ister at one oft he local community 
colleges. Many students were sur-
pri ed last seme ter when line 
outside their English classes at 
Mesa rivaled those at SDSU bu -
ine s c1asse . and when they found 
that many good teachers who had 
been recommended to them were 
no longer teaching. 

This semester, the scenario is 
even more depressing. Mas lay-
offs of part-time faculty at Mesa 
and City Colleges have gutted 
class offerings, leaving students 
scrambling or simply left out in a 
class crasher's no-man's land. For 
example, Mesa cut its part-time 
English teaching staff from 61 in 
1987-88 to j ust 14 now. Over at 
City, English course offerings were 
cut over 20 percent from what 
appeared in the spring clas 
schedule. 

What's going on? First. nearly 
two-thirds of all the teachers in 
California's community colleges, 
state colleges, and universities are 
classed as "part-time. ~ They are 
limited in the number of classes 
they can teach on each campus, 
are paid a third of what the con-
tract faculty are paid, receive few, 
ifany, benefits , and can be laid off 

at any time. During the I 970s and 
'80s, administrators, noticing a 
glut of teachers from the "Baby 

Boom~ generation, and decreas-
ing numbers of students from the 
~Baby Bust" generation, imple-
mented a scheme to exploit this 
former group. Thus, the vast, 
expendable pool of cheap teach-
ing labor was born. 

Now, complicating this in Cali-
fornia, has been the passage of 
State Assembly Bill 1725. One 
thing thi bill is de igned to do is 
pare down the lopsided ratio of 
part-time faculty to full-time facul-
ty (in the community colleges; no 
such bill has been proposed to 
right thi situation in the colleges 
and universities .) In short , the 
community collcges have run 
scared . 

Anticipating the arrival of state 
regqlator , these colleges quickly 
implemented layoffs of part-time 
faculty (Mesa and City), or that 
plus increases in class size 
(Grossmont). This resulted in a 
scaling back of course offerings 
and the widespread dumping of 
some very talented teachers. Of 
course, when the time comes, the 
administrators can proudly 
announce that they are in com-
pliance with AD 1725, but look at 
the cost! 

More evidence of cost cutting 
can be seen in that controversial 
writing program of questionable 
value, "Subject A." Back in 1985, 
it was determined that commun-
ity college teachers could be used 
to teach those writing classes even 
more cheaply than could the T A's. 

That explains some of the cur-
rent mess, the localized portion of 
the vast, sorry quagmire which is 
the crisis situation in American 
education today. , wonder why 

OPINION 
undergradutes, especially, feel that 
they just have to accept ~budget 
education"at far from cheap rates . 
Maybe a little of that old-
fa hioned sixties'activism is need-
ed here - not sit-ins and demon-
strations - but contacts with 
state and federal legislators, and 
the media , to let the public know 
ju t how far thing have gone. 
Don't just complain . Start doing 
somethin&!

UCSD Lacks 
Spirit 
Editor: 

David Poticha's commentary 
on a UCSD football team brought 
an important point to light, name-
ly. the lack of spirit on the cam-
pus. (Guardian. Jan. 26 and 30) 
As a member of the UCSD pep 
band, 1 attend sports events at 
least once a week. The paltry 
showing of suppon for our athletic 
teams on Fridays, contrasted with 
the mob that shows up for TGs 
only emphasizes the lack of spirit. 

After stepping over puddles of 
beer and melting ice cubes and 
around stragglers draining the last 
drops from their cups outside the 
Main Gym, I walk into the nearly 
empty Triton Pavilion each Fri-
day night and wait for the rest of 
the fans to arrive. After about 15 
minutes, a few people begin to file 
in. 

To those of you, and yo,u know 
who you are, who attend' Triton 
sports events, please keep com-
ing. To those of you who get 
totally trashed at 7 on Friday, 
maybe you should consider that 
getting drunk is more fun when 

UC SAN DIEGO INTERNATIONAL SmE 
FILM SERIES PRESENTS 

you have something to celebrate 
- like a Triton victory. 

It's a sad situation when anv-
where from 20 to 50 percent of the 
crowd is made up of the pep band. 
I've also noticed a deafening 
silence when the pep band is not 
at games because there aren't 
enough fans to make up for its 
absence. 

Because, think of all of the 
benefits to attending sports events. 
There are people to scam on, it's a 
great way to avoid homework, it 
fills up those large holes in your 
social calendar, and above all, it's 
fun.

tive, and interested in who you 
are, where you've come from , and 
where you're going. They have 
time to care, and seem to under-
stand if you're by yourself. 

It bas been said that all roads 
are really one road , that the road 
which goes past your front door 
also goes to every far-off, exotic 
and lonely place on the continent. 
If this is true, perhaps it wouldn't 
be so hard to behave more like 
some of the people in those far-
away places. 

College is a very busy time of 
anyone's life. I know that I, per-
sonally, am kept almost constantly 
occupied by all of my different 
activities, classes, and of course 
working here at the Guardian. I 
wouldn't stop any of these things, 
nor would I expect anyone else to. 

I would like to see, however, all 
of the busy students (and others) 
on this campus take just a moment 
to think about another person. 
I'm not saying that people here do 
not care about others, but I have 
heard many people say that this 
school lacks the facilities and in-
frastructure nece ary to be a real 
college campus, necessary to give 
it a sense of cohesion. This is only 
part of the problem. Sure, we're 
all bu y, and sure, there are prob-
lems with what sort of a campus 
this is, but a remedy for this situa-
tion is not beyond the reach of the 
students. 

The next time you see a stran-
ger, try miling; perhaps go 0 far 
as to say 'hello.' I can't guarantee 
that you'l get a positive response, 
but at least you' l have taken a 
step toward making this a better 
campus. Also, I can guarantee 
that if the person you address 
happens to be a newspaper editor 
with a faraway look in his eyes 
who might have just gotten out of 
an old, white BMW, your effort 
will be si ncerely appreciated.

fice, like, " Will the Padres get 
Dale Murphy?~ I 'm sure a choice 
with an explanation could be ren-
dered. 

In the future, Phil should worry 
more about sticking to sports and 
informing people about what's 
currently going on and less about 
prestige and getting 'X' amount 
correct. I could do what Phil does 
weekly, as could most, but I 
seriously doubt that you can do 
what I'm suggesting.

Dubbing - The University of California Board of Regents has approved the renaming of the 
Humanities/Undergraduate Library to honor former UCSD Chancellor John S. Galbraith. The former 
chancellor was an early champion of library improvement and expansion on campus.

sasso, professor of clinical psy-
chiatry at the UCSD Medical 
School and Peter Smith , research 
director of the Center for U.S.-
Mexican studies. 

The stud y will concentrate on 
all angles of the drug problem. 
The psyc,llOlogical aspect of the 
investigation will study why peo-
ple start tak ing drugs in the first 
place and why they progress from 
one drug to another. 

The idea that some drugs serve 
as stepping stones and why will 
also be debated. 

"If part of the concern is how to 
slow down consumption and de-
mand, then part of the intellectual 
problem is what produces demand 
in the first place," Smith said . 

"It's important to look at the 
project not just as research but as 
a broad exchange of experience 
and knowledge," Boeker said . 
"We'd like to convince the coun-
tries out there that they're not 
alone [in dealing with the drug 
problem], it's not hopeless, and 
that it's a common effort in which 
everyone needs to do more," he 
said. 

Boeker, who was the U.S. am-
bassador to Bolivia from 1977-
1980, said that his experience there 
was an impetus to start the study. 

He stated that 10 years ago, 
when he was sent to Bolivia, the 
U.S. government told him that 
cocaine was not a physically ad-
dictive drug. 

'" remember coming back on 
my first return to Washington," 
Boeker said, "and seeing the head

and telling him, 'This stuff is as 
strongly addictive as many of the 
drugs you've been dealing with 
for a long time.' It destroys lives 
very quickly and I've seen people 
in Dolivian jails who live only for 
this stuff. That's their life." 

Boeker stated that his expe-
riences were a "dramatic indica-
tion" of how slow the world has 
been to acquire knowledge a bout 
the basic physiological effects of 
drugs. 

Now, the three-year inquiry is 
in its first phases. The Institute is 
in the process of inviting people to 
join the investigation's steering 
committee. 

People are being recruited from 
"key countries in the hemisphere 
and the U. S .. " said Boeker. 

"They will be a distinguished 
group of people who have been 
involved in policies regarding drug 
control and trafficking from both 
supplier countries in Latin Amer-
ica and the United States," he 
said. 

Representatives from "trans-
mission" countries that don't 
produce drugs but which are either 
places where money is laundered 
or through which drugs 
are passed en route to the United 
States, will also be invited, Smith 
said. 

Describing the group as "inter-
national and far flung," Boeker 
added that experts in a variety of 
disciplines will be invited from 
Mexico, Columbia, Bolivia, Peru 
and other Latin American coun-
tries . People from the United 
States who have worked on drug 
policy questions in this country

will also be asked to participate. 
"We'l be looking around the 

world for the best advice we can 
get," Smith stated. 

Polit ical scientists, economists, 
physicians, psychiatrists and social 
workers will be chosen so that the 
drug problem can be looked a t "in 
all its significant facts ," Boeker 
said . People will be brought in 
from the varying fields "to try to 
think of an effective mix of policy 
measures that will make a d iffer-
ence," Smith added. 

Funding for the first stage of 
the project , a conference, will 
come from the Institute of the 
Americas and UCSD. 

"The Chancellor himself feels 
strongly about and supports this 
particular issue," Boeker sa id . He 
added that the Univeristy had 
agreed to aid the study, but did 
not know from what part of the 
University'S budget the funding 
would come. 

Following the initial confer-
ence, the Institute will ~try to get 
long-term financing to develop a 
program of study and some con-
sultation that will produce a 
stream of publications," Smith 
said. 

A later phase might include a 
large, "blockbusting" publication 
in 1m, and interim reports pres-
ented to the policymaking com-
munity between publications, he 
added. 

"The stages build upon [eachJ 
other," Boeker said; "The first 
stage is to create a high powered 
inter-American steering group 
that will guide the second and

"We take pills for anxiety, for

When asked if he saw any via-

Boeker replied that there were not 
solutions to the problem, but there 
are measures to control it. 

He stressed the need for educa-
tion about drugs and the risks 
associated with them. 

Ann Steinhauer, a clinical de-
pendency counselor at Scripps 
Memorial Hospital's McDonald 
Center. commented that "educa-
tion, knowledge and research" are 

the first steps towa rds contrOlling

She added that a conference 
between South American and 
North American countries sounds 
like "a good move in the right 
direction. ~ 

The chairpeople of the UCSD 
st udy hope that its affects will 
include "jolting into action "those 
Latin American countries that 
have not acknowledged drugs as a 
major threat. 

One of the fallacies Boeker 
hopes the study will get across to 
Latin American countries is the 
belief that "you can be a country 
that gets involved in drug produc-

tion, processing. transit . or the 
passage of drug money, and drug 
use doesn't spin off of th~t , into 
your own society," he said. 

Boeker said that the Institute of 
the Americas is the home base for 
a study that will be international 
and hemispheric in scope.

Attallah Shabazz was a child when she witnessed

As the eldest of Malcolm XiS six daughters, she was the one 
who was most affected by the anguish that followed, and she is 

the one who now confronts and tries to correct the world's

Class A ddresses Values and Environment 
B ANDREA ADLEMAN 
Comriburing Features Editor 

T he issue: "There are two strands of attitudes toward the natural world running 
through the American mind . One 
is that it is the enemy to be con-
quered ... You see that attitude 
coming up all the time in, say, 
advertisements for four-wheel 
drive vehicles . .. It's the mystique 
that's behind the Marlboro ads. 

"Then there's the roma ntic view 
that you get from John Muir and 
some of the English poets, and 
Henry Thoreau. [To them], nature 
is pure and unspoiled, it is Mother 
Nature who calms us and soothes 
us," 

The question: "Why do we think 

the e thing? Why do we have 
these attitude ?" 

Dr. John Stewart has outlined 
here one of the central que tions 
he and his students explore in 
Contemporary Issue 20 (C I-20). 
"Wilderness and Human Value ," 
an unusual course taught every 
spri ng quarter. . 

Stewart earned his B.A. at Den-
nison College, Ohio. He did grad-
uate work at Ohio State and 
taught at Dartmouth for 15 years. 
He founded Muir College at the 
request of UCSD's chancellor in 
the late '60s. He was Muir' first 
provost and held the job for 23 
years. He also founded the music, 
drama, and vis ual arts depart-
ments.

the la t time this spring quarter. 

''I'll miss it," he said. "I form 
very close friendships with a lot of 
the students, especially wit h the 
discussion leaders." 

The discussion leaders are one 
of many aspects that make CI-20 
unique. They are undergraduate 
students who have shown a deep 
interest in the environment, and 
have met the other requirements: 

" You can only talk 
so much about the

tant to get out and 
see what we're talk -
ing about. "

upper division standing, a 3.0 
GPA by spring quarter, and com-
pletion of the two training courses, 
CI-96 and CI-98. Each discussion 
section pursues some topic in 
depth, such as some aspect of pol-
lution or conservation. 

Although, like many classes, 
~ Wilderness and Human Values" 
involves a mid-term and a final 
exam, the lectures are not done in 
the typical format. The majority 
of the lectures are given by guest 
speakers who come from within 
the UCSD community and from 
outside organizations.

well-known speakers will be David

Sperm Donors Solicited for 
Artificial Insemination 
By MARY BETTY HEARD 
Staff Wriler 

A few weeks ago in the front 
section of the Guardian, amidst 
the normal college paper ads for 
Carl's Jr. and Video Gallery, 
there appeared an advertisement 
requesting sperm donors. 

The ad may seem humorous 
at first glance, but it raises sev-
eral questions. What , for exam-
ple, is the sperm used for? How 
much money can a man really 
make? How are the samples 
taken and stored? What are the 
legal responsibilities? 

The answer at the phone num-
ber listed in the paper is a record-
ed mes age. It gave the name of 
the company (the Fertility Cen-
ter of California), listed the q ual-
ifications of prospective donors, 
and explained that the sperm 
was used eXClusively for artifi-
cial insemination. 
- According to the phone mes-
sage, donors must be between 18 
and 30 years of age, must be 
currently enrolled in a local col-
lege (or have taken two years of 
college), must be able to stay in 
the area for one-and-a-half to 
two years to donate, and must 
abstain from ex or masturba-
tion for at least two days before 

donation . It also said that the 
donors were paid $35 per sam-
ple, but they may not be paid the 
first four times. 

Maggie Castillo, director of 
the San Diego branch of the 
Fertility Center of California, 
said, ,,(Recipients] are concerned 

"The donor doesn't 
know the recipient 
and the recipient 
doesn't know the 
donor. " 

- Maggie Castillo 

about [the donor's] background 
... these genes will be passed on 
to their family . Donors are re-
quired to have a college educa-
tion because recipients want 
donors who have a good back-
ground and who are working 
toward a future goal." 

She went on to explain that 
sa mples are taken by masturba-
tion and put through a series of 
four tests . The samples must 
pass through" everal phases of 

creening before [the samples] 
are actually used ," Castillo said. 

First, there is the semen test-
ing. If the sample passes, there is 
the genetics testing, followed by 
urological screening and sexual 
transmitted disease testing, Cas-
tillo said. The donors aren't paid 
for their samples until they have 
passed all four tests; it may take 
up to four donations before a 
donor is paid, she continued. 

Once the donor passes the 
testing, new samples are taken 
and frozen for storage (the sam-
ples are frozen as a solution of 
50 percent semen, 50 percent 
freezing medium). The samples 
are then quarantined for six 
months . They must then pass 
three Acquired Immune Defi-
ciency Syndrome (AIDS) tests . 
They can then be used for insem-
ination. 

All donors are required to 
sign a contract that protects 
anonymity. 

"The donor doesn't know the 
recipient and the recipient 
doesn't know the donor ... [the] 
donor is given a code {used 
instead of the name)," Castillo 
said.

thoughts about donating sperm

words, "one of the three most 
importantiigures in the history of 
American conservation." 

The guest lecturers address a 
variety of environmentally-related 
issues while Dr. Stewart, linking 
the topics together, lectures dur-
ing the remaining class periods. 

Another unique aspect of CI-
20 is its culminating backpacking 
trip held after finals week of sprinR 
quarter. Muir senior Paul Feh-
lau, who was discussion leader 
last year and is currently a member 
of CI-20's student staff, described 

names have been withheld by 
request of the interviewees). 

"I wouldn't - I think you 
have to look at the implications 
.. . in a sense [they're] your off-
spring, but you have no control 
over it;' aid Bruce (age 21) 
in regard to donating sperm. 

~ I would, for giving ome-
thing . .. [but] at the arne time, 
it' a part of me .. . somehow, 
either morally or legally, I'd feel 
partially l e~po nsible ," aid 
David (age 21). 

There are other reasons for 
not donating. For example, one 
glan , who req uested his entire 

the purpose of the trip. 
"Y ou can only talk so much 

about the outdoors," Fehlau said. 
"It's important to us that people 
get out and really see what we're 
talking about ... [The trip] gets 
people out together in a group 
that's interacting directly with the 
environment. Everyone goes 
through an experience where they 
learn that they're okay being out-
side without a lot of the ammeni-
ties that they're used to." 

According to Fehlau, CI-20 ~is

idea because he wasn't "sure of 
how it would be acquired and

John (age 27) would not do-

right for anyone who has an in-
terest in it ... It's [similar to] a 
philosophy course in that a lot of 
what's talked about is the val ue of 
wilderness to people. Everyone is 
aware of [environmental issues). 
The people who find that fasc i-
nating will like this course. " 

Stewart added that C I-20 stu-
dents "tend to be more socially 
co nscious, more conce rned 
about issues, and not just envir-
omental issues, than your average 
university studenl.ft 

Within the broad category of 
the environment, students study 
many specialized subjects: "They 
learn a little biology about over-
population and population dy-
namics," Fehlau said. "They learn 
a little about evolution. They learn 
about the law and how that affects 
.. . the environment. They learn 
about ethics ... and the environ-
ment. " 

Fehlau feels the course allows 
room for a variety of interests and 
self-direction. "Through the dis-
cussion leaders, through Dr. Ste-
wart, and through the people who 
come to speak, no matter what 
[the student's] interest is, there 's 
some sort of outlet for that. 

"The required material of the 
course just makes sure that ... 
[students] have done some serious 
thinking,but it doesn't really point 
[them] in anyone direction, so 
students get out of it what they 
want to, n he explained. 

In terms of the purpose of CI-
20, Stewart is concerned that stu-
dents think about the issues and 
perhaps reevaluate their beliefs 
in the process. 

"The most important thing is 
what they learn about their per-
sonal beliefs and values, and where 
these things ca me from," Stewart 
said. " In fact, what we're doing is 
using the problems that arise in 
relation to human beings and the 
natural world as a kind of area to 
explo re how we make value-
oriented decisions. 

Stewart is impressed by the 
large number of students inter-
ested in exploring the complexi-
ties of "Wilderness and Human 
Values ." 

The course "has no connection 
with a major or a minor. It doesn't 
satisfy any degree requirement, 
and yet, it always has a very large 
enrollment, and it a lways gets 
very, very high praise from the 
students who take it ," Stewart 
said . "Some of them eve n say its 
the most important course they've 
taken on the campus."

Not everyone is cut out to change 
the world. After all, it takes educa-
tion, skills and a spare two years. 
Also a willingness to work. Hard. 
This year 3,750 Americans will join 
the Peace Corps to do just that. 
They'll do things like build roads, 
plant forests and crops, teach 
English. develop small businesses, 
train community health workers. 
or even coach basketball. However; 
what they'll be doing isn't half as 
important as the fact that they'll be 
changing a little piece of the world 
. . . for the better. 
And when they return, these 
3,750 Americans will find that 
experience doing hard work will 
have another benefit. It's exactly 
what their next employers are 
looking for. 
So, give the Peace Corps your next 
two years. And while you're out 
changing the world, you'll also be 
making a place in it for yourself.

MURDER 
Continued from page 3 

The officer al 0 te tified that he 
observed a "deep abra ion" on 
Richardson' right pinky finger. 

"\ sa~ a mark that wa indented 
IOto the finger [that] left an 
impres ion," Howard said . "It was 
a traight line, more or Ie , that 
appeared to curve with the finger. 
It was red ... like a burn." 

Howard said that he ob erved a 
similar but "less pronounced" 
mark on Richardson' left pink y. 

.,... 

Richard on wa said to have 
explained the fir ·t mark as a burn 
incurred while cooking the pre-
vious evening. He could not 
explain the second one. 

Mabalot , the hou d~eeper, te -
tified that on the evening of Dec. 
19 the Richardsons "were happy" 
and said he saw both of them 
"working in the kitchen."

NEWS 
According to perber, his exam-

ination of Beth Richardson's 
body, which was found several 
fect from a long-wired telephone 
in her workplace, revealed the 
marks of'11exible ligature around 
the neck and around the chin." 

fter making a model of these 
ligature marks from dental im-
pre sion material and comparing 
it with a telephone wire of the 
type found near Beth Richard-
son's body, Sperber concluded 
that the "wire fit exactly a far a 
its width into the injury pattern

Sperber explai ned that , to fit 
the Inj ury pattern, a port ion of the

fit the narrowing width of the 
right portion of the injur . 

In respon 'e to queries by Siref. 
Richardson' lawyer, Sperber ad-
mitted that the neck injury could 
also have resulted from the altera-
tion of a cord by cutting it to 
taper to a narrow width. 

Sperber also testified that he 
examined Richard on's finger 
while he was in the custody of the

UCSA BOARD MEETING HIGHLIGHTS 

CAMPAIGN FOR HEALTH INSURANCE PROCEEDS ON MANY FRONTS 
.Randy Giles, GSA President at UCSD; Sheila Allen, GSA Internal President at UCSF; 
and Lisa Adler, Chair ofUCSA's Student Life and Concerns Committee will represent 
U.C. students on a Universitywide committee created by the Office of the President to 
review and make recommendations regarding student health services and insurance. 
The committee will explore is whether combining all campuses under a single system 
can bring the rates down for students. The committee will also decide whether or not 
the University should pay insurance premiums for student employees of the University 
or subsidize insurance costs for all students, both of which UCSA has urged the 
University to do in recent years. The committee is expected to begin its work in early 
February. 
On the subject of how student health insurance should be financed, the Board adopted 
the position that student paid programs should be funded through the Registration Fee 
rather than through additional campus fees levied for insurance premiums. Health 
insurance is a traditional and appropriate area for Reg Fee funding; however, due to 
increasing demands on Reg Fee funds to support programs previously financed by the 
State, students desiring health insurance have gone outside the normal funding 
mechanisms in ordeno find money. While Ed and Reg fees are capped at 10% for any 
single year, campus based fees can be raised without limit 
UCSA will also support AB 10by Assembly Member Hauser which would create a state 
administered health insurance program for all citizens. This bill is essentially a 
universal health insurance proposal which would require every citizen to enroll in a 
health insurance program. Employers would be required to pay 75% of the premium 
forall employees and their dependents. Unemployed and self·employed persons would 
pay their own premiums; however, assistance would be provided to those experiencing 
financial hardship. Additional funds would be obtained from a I % tax on the gross 
patient revenues of hospitals, professional health care providers, health plans, and 
health insurers. UCSA Campus Offices will be contacting legislative District Offices 
in support of this bili. 

LANGUAGE ADOPTED FOR !JCSA LEGISLATION 
UCSA has formally adopted the legislative language for the two bills that it will be 
sponsoring this year: 
The fust will be a resolution stating the intent of the Legislature that students control 
the use and allocation of all student fees and that students have operational control over 
student funded buildings. In addition, the resolution will request the Univcrsity to report 
on the growth of campus based fees and their impact on the cost of education. The 
resolution also calls for the establishment of a committee under the auspices of the 
California Postsecondary Education Commission to submit a report 10 the Legislature 
ruarding the~jssues. . .. . . . 
TIre second UC~A legtslauve IOll.JaUve Involves student employee rights and benefits. 
The resolution calls upon the University to cease discriminating against student em-
ployees simply because they are part-time students and not f!lll -time University 
employees. This is a particular problem in the area of health benefits since the 
University recently ruled that no student, regardless of what job s/he performs for the 
University, may receive health insurance. Approximately 900 student employees will 
lose their University paid health insurance due to that decision. 
The resolution also seeks a study on the working conditions of academic student 
employees such as Teaching and Research Assistants. UCSA representatives at each 
campus are currently seeking individual employcc gncvances in areas such as pay. 
training, hours of work, grievance procedures, rCcrUJlJncnt and selection.Job dutie ,and 
the Impact of work on academIC goals.

Men 's Basketball 

Tri ton forward Rick Balt, 
sta rting for lhe inj ured Gordon 
Mc ei il . scored an astounding 36 
points and grabbed 13 rebounds 
on Friday night at the Triton 
Pavilion , but his feats were not 
enough in a 96-89 loss to Cal 
State San Bernardino. 

UCSD (7-14) held a 48-40 lead 
at halftime and upped that lead to 
13 points midway through the 
second half, but CS San Bernar-
dino put together a 12-0 scori ng 
run to overcome the deficit and 
put the game in the win column. 

CSSB (15-5) made ail 20 of its 
second half free throw attempts 
and 25 of26 for the game. Gerald 
Duncan led CSSB with 33 points 
and Dave Webb added 2 1. 

Golf 

The UCSD golf team fell vic-
tim to Cal State Dominguez Hills 
in its first official match of the 
season last Friday. 390-398. 

Rainy conditions at the Los 
Verdes Golf Club forced the match 
to last only nine holes, so the 195 
and 199 team scores had to be 
doubled. 

Tritons Ed Tischler and Devin 
Thomas finished with the top 
scores for UCSD, both shooting 
two over par with 38. The Tritons 
will compete agaist CSDH again 
and Cal State San Bernardino a 
week from today at Arrowhead 
Country Club.

As far as the playoff picture, 
Malone claims that, realistically, 
they must win the rest of their six 
games because there are seven 
teams in contention for spots in 
the western region. If UCSD can 
pull off the victories, not only 
would they obliterate the school 
record of 17 wins, but their 
numbers might just come up. 

David· Poticha's 
interview with in-
jured players '(first 
run in the Guardian 
on Feb. 2) will be 
continued on Thurs-
day in SPORTS. 

By JONCARLO MARK 
Stall Writer 

Heading into the eason, the 
men's lacrosse team was unsure of 
its destiny. The players knew they 
had talent and potential, yet there 
was some doubt that the youthful 
team could hold up under pres-
sure. 

However, Saturday'S win could 
prove to more thanjust the second 
league win for the Tritons. After 
UCSD whipped Claremont Col-
lege 13-4, the team is realizing 
that playoffs are a real possibility. 

"We played well as a team," 
stated defense person Orion Alca-
lay. "Our offense is really clicking 
and our defense is dominating all 
opposing attack." 

It is easy to see why the victory 
was so uplifting for the Tritons

POINT LOMA UCSD 2 Matches· 

PHIL'S ANALYSIS ... So what if the Triton men's 
tennis team is 0-2 and playing this one on the road? 
The last two teams UCSD has been defeated by, 
USIU and US D, are both Division I teams with excel-
lent tennis programs. USD, who won all nin~ of the 
matches when it played UCSD, is top-ranked . But in 
Division Ill , the Tritons are top-ranked as well and 
have not yet had a chance to prove their high ranking 
against a Division III opponent. That will all 
change on Wednesday afternoon at 3 p.m., when the 
Tritons travel south to face Point Lorna Nazarene. 
Even without Hunter Galloway, UCSD's to~ed player, 
this one should be an easy one for Sig Huber, Randy 
Mark , and company. Therefore, give two matches to 
Point Lorna Nazarene and ...

because Claremont had a 2-0 
record with both wins coming by 
more than a to-point margin. 

Leading the offensive charge 
for UCSD was Juan Millan, who 
pumped in five goals. Doug 
Shaddle, who scored three goals 
last week, had another impressive 
performance with a goal and an 
assist. 

However, the goal that raised 
the most excitement was Dan 
Larsen's fast break "quick stick" 
score on the assist from John 
Rent. 

Again the Triton defense, led 
by Sven Haynie, took apart the 
opposing attack. Head Coach 
Bruce Seitz singled out Haynie's 
performance as an example of 
how to play defense. 

Goalie Joe Brown had 11 saves 
and received intense checking and 
support from Alcalay and Chuck 
Leslie. 

The young Tritons will see if 
the confident enthusiasm will 
carry through to next week's game 
when they travel north to battle 
Occidental. 

RI ... Vi .... ' GUlUdian 
Darren Gaspary and the Triton 
defense kept the Claremont 
sticks in check all day long.

Nine Wins in a Row Sets School Record for Women's Basketball 

15-4 Tritons Take Two Over the Weekend 
By DANA CHAIKE 
Staff Writer 

Ten, II, 15, 21 , 24,25, and 32 
may not have been the winning 
Lotto number, but they proved 
to be a jackpot combination for 
the UCSD women's ba ketball 
team in 91-74 and 85-61 victories 
over Cal State San Bernardino 
and Redlands thi weekend . The 
Triton (15-4) extend their win-
ning streak to nine, a chool 
record. 

In the fir t half of the San Ber-
nardino game, the quad traded 
the lead 18 time, with neither 

team opening a gap of more than 
ix, which the ho t Tritons did 

24-18 at the 9: 15 mark. While the 
arch rival Coyotes relied on some 
fancy passing to fight back, U CS D 
used its bonus number to light it 
up and go ah~d 32-29 on two 
consecutive long jumpers. 

Twenty-one , Beth Koenig, 
started hot and stayed that way, 
tallying 12 in the half and a 
season-high 22 on a 9-14 shooting 
performance mostly from the 18-
foot range. 

Triton point-guard Nancy 
Caparaz added to her team-
leading steal and assist totals in 
the waning moment of the half, 

Men's Tennis Attempts to Net 
A National Title This Year 
ByJORDA KARUBIA 
Staff Writer 

Head Coach John Hammer-
meister i engaged in the pro-
cess of rebuilding UCSD' 
men's tenni team. La t year, 
the team made it to post eason 
p"tay for the fir t time since 
1984. This year, however, the 
team is more experienced and 
more capable, and its goal 
have risen accordingly. "This 
year," Hammermeister says 
with determination, "we are 
going to be a real factor in 
postseason play." 

The players, most of whom 
are returning from last year's 
squad, have the ability to back 
up their coach's words. Ac-
cording to Hammermeister, 
current top- eeded player Sig 
Huber (25th in the country), 
"can play with anyone in Di-
vision III." Huber, along with 
Rand y Mark, returning after a 
year at SDSU, and Chris Bel-
loli, who "takes divots out of 
the court on his erve," hould 
be among the be t player in 
Division III this year. 

Other contri butors to the 
Triton!.' ucce s include Jeff 
French, the only enior on the 
squad; Tim Ditzler, "the team's 
best athlete,"; Jim Elliot; 
Francois Monneur; and Hun-
ter Galloway, the 10th ranked 
player in Division III who has 
recently resumed play after a 
leave of absence for personal 
reasons. 

And the ucce eem im-
minent. The team is presently 
ranked fifth in the country by 
the Volvo Tenni Collegiate 
Rank ing , and the doubles 
team of Huber and Galloway 
i also ranked fifth . 

Their schedule i filled with 
matche against some of the 
top Division I team as well as 
seven of the top 20 Division III 
teams, but UCSD is planning 
on beating up on Division III 
teams. Judging from the wealth 
of talent the Tritons boast, the 
opposition should be black and 
blue. 

The Tritons will travel to 
Point Lorna Nazarene on Wed-
nesday to begin their Division 
III competition. 

Randy Mark is currently the 
second-seeded player for 
UCSD. 

pickingoffpa sesand di hingout 
other . She also scored her 
number, II, and came close to a 
triple-double with 10 boards and 
nine steals. 

UCSD found itself back on the 
court with a 41-35 lead and pos-
ession to start the second half, 

yet four minutes later looked up 
to discover a 12-point lead and a 
demoralized opponent that had 
yet to score. 

Senior Tracy Ragatz burned 
off her first half shooting chill 
with a blazing run of eight con-
ecutive points on two three-

pointers and a jumper on her way 
to a 19-point evening. Last year' 
national leader in three-point 
percentage, she is currently ranked 
fifth in three-pointer made and 
12th in percentage at 44.1 on 26 of 
59 in Division III. 

Reserve post 32, better known 
a Kathy Fitzpatrick, looked as if 
she wa going to the big spin wit 
some of her inside moves, as sh 
tripled her coring average with 
II and helped extend the Triton 
lead to 71-57. 

Ju t when the Coyote began a 
run, eventually closing within five 
at 71-66, UCSD repelled them 
with 20 points in the la t four 
minutes. Half of those came from 
freshper on Cari Young, the sixth 
Triton in double figures, along 
with Bernadette Diepenbrock, to 
close out the win 91-74. 

Afterwards, Head Coach Judy 
Malone commented on the diver-
sity of scoring. "We've got scoril)g 
punch from every position. They 
can't key on one player, like Beth 
[Koenig] being hot in the first 
half, and Tracy [Ragatz] going to 
work at the end. " 

Diepenbrock agreed, maintain-
ing that "the inside game has 
developed, and we're a threat 
both ways [inside and outside]. 
They must choose who to guard." 

"Kathy [Fitzpatrick] had a great 
game, especially when we needed 
it because Jill [Koster] was having 
an off night. She hit three against 
their big girl , played great defen e. 
and hit her free throw ," praised 
Malone about her transfer stu-
dent. 

Heading into aturday night's 
game against the Redlands Bull-
dog (5-11), Malone hoped that 
her guards would not be too tired, 
as Caparaz, Ragatz, and Koenig 
all played at least 35 minutes each 
against CSUSB. 

She had no reason to worry. 
U S D tallied close to the same

numbers in less time against a 
team Malone claimed "does a lot 
of weird stuff." 

"It's the same situation as the 
Smith Tournament," Malone 
pointed out, in reference to the 
tournament where UCSD rallied 
off a tough semi-final game to win 
the final the next night. 

UCSD opened a bit slow, tak-
ing a minute to decipher the Bull-
dogs' box-and-one defense that 
keyed on Ragatz. After trailing 
6-2, the Tritons quickly used the 
talents of the thankf ully-not-tired 
group to come back and take a 
9-8 lead they never relinquished. 

Once again, Koenig lived up to 
the nickname "Swish" on her 
Colorado license plate, ripping 12 
in the half and 21 overall , though 
he ended her streak of perfect 

free throw shooting at four games. 
Luckily, the Tritons buried their 

outside shots because they were 
having difficulties on the offen-
sive boards. Their defense, how-
ever, allowed Redlands to take 
three or four shots at times. "I 
wasn't satisfied with our defense. 
Essentially, we let them take every 
shot they wanted. If they'd shot 
better, it would have been a dif-
ferent game," stipulated Malone 
afterwards. 

Different it wasn't, not even 
from the previous game, as the 
Tritons used the same combina-
tions and tactics: Koenigjumpers, 
Fitzpatrick whirlwinds, and Ca-
paraz and Ragatz assists to lead 
at the half 43-26. 

The second half proved to be 
an instant replay of the first, as 
UCSD scored almost as many 
points using what worked in the 
first half. They incorporated some
