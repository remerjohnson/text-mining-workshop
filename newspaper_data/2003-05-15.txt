whether the referendum process

ra llC, whether an expanSIOn and

expa n>lon woult! mea n to student

I nterim Comm issioner of 
tudent Advocacy Brie Finegold 

argued the refere nd um's t!raw-
backs. 

" It's a lot of mane), and could 
have been done a lot cheaper by a 
lot of d iffe rent ways," sa lt! 
Fi negold m her o penmg state-
ment. " \Ve shoul d u e the space 
that we alrea t!y have be Ller and 
figure out how much more we 
need t fit the need o f a growmg 
school and expand that way." 

U niver ity enters Advisory 
Boa rt! hair James Lynch, who 
spoke III support o f the referen -
dUITI , focused on the I sue of 
pupul a ll o n growth and stated 
that th e eXI stin g Uni versity 
Cente rs will no t be abl e to 
accommodate stud e nt in the 
future. 

According to Lynch , the pop-
ulation of UCSD will grow to up 
to 30,000 and, at the moment, 
there are only 17 tudent organi -
zation offices for over 372 Stu-
dent organizations. 

" Restaurants are extremely 
crowded and it is almost impo si-
ble for tudent organlzaoons to 
have meeting spaces at any time of 
the day," Lynch saId. 

Audience members were also 
allowed to ask a question for each 
side to answer. Each side was 
asked to elaborate on the issue of 
student control and whether the 
referendum written by the 
Univer icy Centers Expansion 
Taslc. Force was student-initiated. 

"The process has been entirely 
student-controlled from the ori-
gins of the task force, when for-
mer A. . Presidents Jenn Brown 
and Jeff Dodge submined a char-
ter to A.S. Council," Lynch said. 
~Then a JrOUp 01 all ItlIdenu put

A.S. president speaks out 
in favor of expansion

A- . President Jeremy Paul 
Gallagher [Oolc. a public stance 
supporting the Price Center 
and Student Center 
Expan ion Referendum on 
May 13, briefly spealc.ing out 
in its favor from the stage in 
the Price Center, where a 
debate on the referendum was 
held a half hour later. 

GalJagher has been a vocal 
critic of the A-S. Council taking 
a stance on the referendum, and 
had advised the coWlcil against 
passing a resolution that urged 
students to vo~ "yes" on the 
referendum. The resolution 

was passed at the cOWlcil's May 
7 meeting, despite suggesnons 
from Gallagher himself that he 
might consider vetoing the 
decision. 

Some supporters of the 
"Vote No" campaign criticized 
the president'S decision to take 
a public stance. 

"I don't think it's appropri-
ate for the A.S. to urge stu-
dents to vote one way or 
another in an election that 
they're running," said Brie 
Finegold, interim commis-
sioner of student advocacy, 
who spolc.e against the referen-
dum in the debate.

Davis makes no

Calif. budget revision 
spares UC, Cal State 
By EVAN McLAUGHUN 

News Editor 

Gov. Gray Davis made no addi-
tional cuts to the University of 
California in the May revision of 
the 2003-04 budget in light of 
deficit projection that has increased 
by over 53 billion since January. 

~The governor has said all along 
that education was his top priority," 
a Davis spolc.esperson said. 

~Funding for UC was high on the 
governor's list of things to protect 
while faced with malc.ing more cuts." 

Davis ' May revision includes a 
5300 milJion reduction to the uni-
wnity and I propose4 S79S per 
year increase to UC student fees. 
The UC Board of Regents had 
planned on voting on whether to 
approve the increase at its May 14 

meeting, but delayed any action 
because of uncertainty urrounding 
the coinciding release of the new 
budget proposal. UC officials were 
pleased no further cuts were made. 

"We are very grateful to the 
governor for placing a priority on 
public education in this time of 
great financial distre s for the 
state," aid Lawrence C. 
Hershman, UC Vice Pre ident for 
Budget, in a May 14 taternent. 
"The governor elearly recogmze 
the major role UC can play III 
stimulating CalifornIa's economIc 
recovery, and he hare our View 
that we must contlJ1we providang

Pneumonia vaccine may 
alleviate heart attacks 

The Immune response triggered by pneu-
monia vaCCInations also reduces atherosclero-
SIS, a chronic Inilammatlon In blood vessels that 
leads to heart attacks and strokes, according to 
researchers at the UCSD School of Medicine. 

The researchers used mice to demon-
strate that vaccination with pneumococci 
microbes, and the resulting immune 
response tnggered by the body, reduced the 
extent of atherosclerosis by 21 percent. 

A complex disease with multiple causes, 
atherosclerosis has traditionally been consid-
ered a disorder caused by excess levels of 
cholesterol in the body. More recently, scien-
tists have Identified the chronIC Inflammatory 
process of the disease, WIth recent studies 
suggesting that the body's natural Immune 
responses might be able to modulate the 
progression of atherosclerOSIS. 

The study was published in the June 
2003 issue of the joumal Nature. 

Two UCSD faculty elected 
AAAS fellows 

An economist at UCSD and an oceanog-
rapher at UCSD's SCriPPS Institution of

Cellular defed in retina 
linked to blindness 

A defective cellular process within the reti-
na was discovered to be the cause of Usher 
syndrome 1 B blindness by UCSD School of 
Medicine researchers. 

Usher syndrome type 1 is a rare disorder 
that causes severe deafness and blindness in 
about 7,000 Americans. Children are born pro-
found~ deaf, and start going blind later in life. 
Previous studies had identifled a mutant gene 
called myosin Vila as playing a role in Usher 
syndrome 1 B. The current investigation details 
the method the defective ~ne uses to under-
mine normal cellular lunetton in the retina. 

Using mice, the researchers identified that 
the intercellular process that results m Usher 
syndrome 1 B takes place between the pho-
toreceptor and retinal pigment epithelium 
cells, which are one of the outer layers of the 
retina. As a result the study demonstrates 
that the RPE needs to be targeted for gene 
therapy of Usher IB, whicln can be affected by 
simply adding the normal gene to the cells. 

The study is published online the week of 
May 12, 2003, In the journal Proceedings of 
the National Academy of Sdences. 

Brain chemical important 
for mammary grands 

A molecule long associated with nerve 
cell growth in the brain also orchestrates the 
growth of mammary glands during puberty, 
according to UC Santa Cruz researchers. 

During puberty, the mammary gland 
grows into the fat pad, led by the vigorous 
growth and branching of the gland's tips, 
called end buds. The molecule, a signaling 
protem called netnn-l, was found to act as a 
kind of glue holding these buds together. 

Because of the important role of netrin- 1 in 
the mammary ~ands, UCSC researchers 
believe that mutatJons In the genes for netnn-l 
may be associated with invasIVe breast cancer. 

The study is published in the March issue 
of the joumal Development Cell.

Item A 
The A.S. Council allocated $450 to 

Venture Forth, a student-initiated entrepreu-
nial organi7.tion, for its annual Business Plan 
Competition after debate over whether the 
council should allocate funds to a student 
organi7.3tion if it had not requested SOFAH 
allocations earlier. 

The allocation was approved 15-3-3 . 
Several council members were concerned that 
the allocation might set a precedent for other 
student organi7.3tions to make late requests. 
However, others argued on behalf of the 
organi7.ation, which had could not apply orig-
inally for SOFAS funds because it planned to 
hold the event off-campus. The organil.ation

THUR DAY, MAY 15, 2003 THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Budget: UC to absorb earlier;planned cuts 
continued from page r 

the University of Ca lifornia has 
suffered almost $1 billion in cuts to 
State-University Partnership and 
core funding. 

In his 2003-04 budget proposal, 
Davis reduced funding to adminis-
tration and libraries by $36.5 million 
while making a $29 million across-
the-board reduction to research. [f 
Davis' budget is approved, $33 mil-
lion would be cut from educational 
outreach programs. 

Resident undergraduate student 
fees would be raised by $795 yearly 
in addition to the $405 annual 
increase enacted in Spring 2003. 
Before the Regents approved the 
$405 increase in January, student 
fees at the university had not been 
raised since 1994. 

About one-third of the money 
generated by the proposed increas-
es would be funneled back to Stu-
dent financial aid, UC officials said. 
The fee increase would be covered 
for by grant-eligible students, or 

about 40 percent of all UC under-
graduates. Students who come 
from families earning between 
$60,000 and $90,000 per year are 
eligible to have one-half of the pro-

" The governor clearly 
recognizes the major role 

UC can play in 
stimulating California's 

. " econorruc recovery .. , 
- Lawrence C. Hershman, 

UC Vice President for Budget 

po ed increase covered by UC Fee 
Grants. 

While UC officials are satisfied 
that no further cuts were made to the 

university in the May revision, they 
remain skeptical that no additional 
cuts will be made as other state law-
makers have drafted budget propos-
als that call for between $80 million 
and $400 million in additional cuts. 

"The even further cuts con-
tained in the proposals from the 
legislature would do great harm to 
the university and could lead to 
additional tudent fee increases, 
constraints on new enrollments 
starting in 2004-05, or both," 
Hershman said in a May 14 state-
ment. "We will vigorously oppose 
these additional cuts." 

Along with the University of 
California, the May revision also 
made no additional cuts to the 
California State University'S fund-
ing. About $ 160 million were 
restored to California Community 
Colleges and $700 million were 
restored to K - 12 schools. 

The state constitution mandates 
that a budget be passed by June 15 
to be enacted on July I. 

Debate: Pro and con sides square off 
wnunlled from {>age I 

FlIlcgold refuted Lynch's argu-
ment by fim stati ng that the Pnce 
Center expansIOn was 1Il111ated by 
adminlstrallon . 

She also ~tated that after previ-
ou~ fce rderendl1lll, fo r exp.I11'lon

"In terills of It being democrat-

Finego ld 'Ibo dlsc lIssed tht; 
proce<,s llf wI'Ili ng the referendulll

because onl y non-legally bllld lOg

Davis' budget 
revision makes no 
new cuts to UC 
The late t revi ion to Gov. Gray Davis 

2003-04 state budget propo al wa released 
May 14, and to the relief of students 
throughout the public education ystem, no 
additional Cuts for the Univer ity of 
Cali fornia were proposed beyond those 
already seen back 10 January. 

A certain amount of g-ratitude should be 
given to Davis for not tmposing a further 
burden on students than those in the original 
propo al. Tho e still include the $300 mil-
lion in base budget cuts for the ni\'ersity of 
California as part of a plan to address a state 
budget deficit now estimated at $38 billion. 

Funhermore, the 40 percent of under-
graduates that are grant-eligible will benefit 
br having the UnJ\'ersit)' absorb the entire 
amount of fee increa e through financial 
aid. Other students from households earn-
ing between 60,000 and $90,000 per year 
will see a portion of the increase covered 
through UC Fee Gran a well. 

Over a three-year period ending next 
year, the enrollment at the vni\'ersity of 
Califorma will have grown by I percent 
while slmultaneoush, seemg . a 6 percent 
decrea'>e I Its state-fUnded buduet. 

Davt!> "hould be applauded for placing a 
priority on publIc education in thIS time of 
fiscal dIS re · . Certainly the 'Cy tem 
plars a certain role 111 stimulating the state's 
economic recovery, and as pan of that, sru-
dents sa w the first tuition Increase in eigh 
yea rs. Placing an additional request of 
either the students or the schools as a whole 
could be an overly harsh taxation . 

It IS no\\ up to the Board of Regents to 
suppOrt Davl newest prolXl al. In contrast 
to the tolerable requests made Iw the most 
recent reVlsions, there are currenih' propos-
ab from the Callforllla state lef.,%l3nJre that

LEnERS TO THE EDITOR 
Safety is crucial during 

Sun God festivities 
radicals manipulate the voice of the 
students against the expansion ref-
erendum. How can one, under the 
guise of representing student inter-
est, oppose a referendum endorsed 
by institutions of student life, 
including the Cross Cultural 

more than double the student fees 
proposed. 

Attention, annoying 
people: Shut up 

Editor: 
The annclpation is over. Sun 

God 2003 has finally arrived and will 
be on RIMAe field May 16. The 
event has continued to increase in 
Size, attendance and festivities with 
Illore food, games and entertain-
ment than ever before. Ths is a day 
to spend with friends as the school 
year comes to an end. We hope that 
all of our efforts up to and on the day 
of Sun God wi ll make everything as 
fun and safe for all of UCSD.

4. The most grievous of the "no" 
campaign's actions has been preying 
upon snldent insecurioes regarding 
financial aid. The campaign cites an 
unidentified lener from 1990 claim-
ing that promised increases 111 finan -
cial aid to cover mandatory fees are 
"patently fal e." They justify their 
statement by claiming that two years 
ago, an unidentified sntdent con-
tacted the tate Legislature 
Comminee on Higher Education 
and spoke with Paul Mitchell. [ 
don't know who Paul Mitchell is, 
but r know this: he is definitely not a 
member of the comminee. Contrast 
this nebulous information with the 
comments of UCSO's Director of 
Financial Aid Vince De Anda who 
said, "Financial aid has always fund -
ed any mandatory and universal fees 
for students demonstrating financial 
need." Unlike the e oteric informa-
tion that the "no" campaign has. his 
lener may be viewed in its entirety 
at hltp:llfxponriol1.lIcstl.fdll. 

Those who pester others 
may not be aware of it 

Everyone is encouraged to 
enjoy the festival, but please keep a 
few things in mind: 

U SO is encouraged to have a

Any visibly intoxicated per on 
will be denied entrance to the event

Don't vote 'no' on fee 
based on misinformation 
Editor: 

It has been disgusting to watch 

ollege Counci ls and UCSD 
Athletics' As a student who has 
seen the evolution of this referen-
dum, my points of contention with 
the rhetoric of the "no" campaign 
are these: 

I. The "no" campaign, co-run 
by ex-A.S . President Jenn Brown, 
claims that the referendum "isn't 
student-i nitiated." Apparently Ms. 
Brown forgot that she wa one of 
the two stUtlfllls who wrote the 
charter to nlir;aU the task force that 
propo ed the referendum. 

2. The "no" campaign asserts 
that we are "paying for mostly 
Greek org office space." hame on 
the "no" campaign for these out-
right lies. The referendum will cre-
ate 84 new student organization 
office; the number of Greek orgs 
on Ihis campus is nowhere near 
(' vcn half of 4. 

3. The malcontenrs want us to 
helieve that I1Iverstty Ceillcr 
Ad\1sory Board's space allocation 
decisions, particularly with regard 
to C 0 ate ring, are wastmg 
~tuuent-funded space. They fail to 
mennon that If thi referendum 
passes, students would only pay for 
48 percent of the expansion. The 
otller 52 percent would be commg 
from the rents exacted by the 
UniverSity Center upon its ten-
ams. The "no" campaign conve-
niently omits that if we were to 
remove sources of revenue, stu-
denrs would be left having to pay 

Politics has brought out the 
worst on thi campus over the past 
year. I have t:ried to present faers on 
which sntdems may base their deCI-
sions. For further informJtion 
regarding the punou claIm of 
the "no" camp3lgn, please VISit 
bttp:1166. 7S. 241 . I 69lmp0l1st. 

[ would Itke to be aboveboard 111 
tating that I am a vonng member 

of the Expansion Task Force, a 
contributor to the "Vote Yes" cam-
paign and JUSt like Jenn Brown, a 
proud member of the Greek sys-
tem. My views are my own, and I 
do not speak on behalf of any of 
these organizations.

Bertrand Fan 

T hroughout the history of time, many questions have been asked, and a consid-
erable amount of those questions 
have been answered. But one 
question that [haven't heard a lot 
of explanation of IS this: Do 
annoying people know that 
they're annoying? I don't think 
this is the lcind of question that 
can be answered with a simple yes 
or no answer. The initial question 
that we have to solve IS thi s: Do 
they even su peer that they' re 
annoying? How the hell could 
they nOt? I'll give you an e.xam-
pie. 

I had a cia once that was 
completely full. There were peo-
ple Ittmg in the aisles because 
they came a minute late, but there 
were always rune chairs empty 
about three row from the front. 

One day, I came in late, and I 
sat in one of these chaIrs. After 
checking for the usual reasons 
why chairs are empty such a crap 
all over them, bloclong a proJec-
tor and broken armresr, r relaxed 
and Itstened to the lecture. About 
10 minutes later, the professor 
was telling a tory, and the guy 
next to me iust ye lled somethll1g 
out that he thought was funny. 1 
think it' safe to av that he wa 
the only one that thought It was 
funny becau e the whole class-
room was tlent for a few seconds 
and looked at him. The professor 
continued, anu about 20 IllJnutes 

later, the eXflct S071U thmg hap-
pened. Except this time, someone 
yelled, "Shut Up '" and everybody 
started laughll1g. And then , he 
started to laugh because he 
thought that everybody thought 
that he was funny. and he did it a 
few more tllnes throughout the 
lecture. 

r started to realtze that there 
was a penmeter of empty seats 
around thIS guy with the excep-
tion of one, occupIed by you rs 
trul y. r wanted to yell, "I'm not 
with this asshole!" but It was toO 
late. [ was already associated With 
him. 

Now, it should be clear to any 
normal human belllg that this 
guy was annoying, but annoying 
people aren 't normal human 
beIngs. T hey think on a com-
pletely dIfferent wavelength than 
normal people. They have J com-
pletely different seme of humor 
- no, to be more exact, the} 
have no sen e of hUlllor at all. but 
thlllk thev do. 

Are y~u Jnnoymg? I've got to 
tell you. the fact that you're read-
ing tile Gllortilfl/1 IIlcreases your 
chances by about 1,000 percent. 
Writing for the GUlllduUI IS even 
higher - res, I realize the Irony 
in that statement, but we're Just 
tallong about you here. 

[ would say there 15 about a I 
percent cha nce that you're not 
annoylllg. Now, I know you're 
saymg to yourself, "I'm not 
annoying. Who's thIS asshole to

Alcohol: Most people 
drink before reaching age 21 

Stop: If you're reading this, you're annoying 
com in ued from page 4 

warped picrure of youths' relation-
ship with alcohol, and this ha 
resulted in the automanc criminal -
Izanon of a normal experimental 
activity. 

This Ignorance and demoniza-
tion also leads to the mistaken fear 
that if the minimum drinlcing age 
were to be adjusted, America 's youth 
would guzzle tequila for breakfast, 
copulate like rabbits, have drunken 
brawls, never accomplish anything 
productive and kill each odler while 
driving drunk. Consider first, how-
ever, that the median age at which 
children first consume alcohol is 13, 
according to the Community Anti-
Drug Coalitions of America . That is 
a full eight years before a person 
reaches the legal minimum age, and 
is compelling evidence that this law 
- just like Prohibition - is not 
enough to negate America' custom-
ary use of alcohol starting in the 
teenage yea rs . 

Thus, the adjustment of the law 
would have minimal negative 
impact because it's currendy having 
an Inconsequential effect on the 
drinking habits of under-21-year-
olds. Additionally, an adju rment 
would have the important and 
plea ant by-product of bringing 
much of this drinking into safe 
areas - bar, restaurants and the 
like - where it can be regulated, 
and social drinking, rather than 
drinking to get drunk, is promoted. 
Binge dnnking can be the first indi-
cator of the danger of alcoholism, 
another problem that the current 
law IS ostensibly trying to combat. 
Shifting the focus to social drink-
ing, however, has been shown to be 
an effective antidote to the with-
drawal from society that alcoholism 

brings, according to UCSD ociol-
ogy profe sor tephen Lincoln . 

Then there is dle most oft-
repeated argument, ilie one iliat' 
so ba ic, so fundamental that it 
throws the hypocrisy of laws 
regarding American youth into 
sharp relief: It's absurd iliat a law 
essentially tells people under 21 
that they have no personal respon-
ibility when we can legally be exe-

cuted for a crime, get killed in war, 
smoke cigarettes, get married and 
own a gun. Alcohol is potentially 
dangerous, but so are cars, assault 
rifle , knives and cigarettes - all of 
which are legal for an IS-year-old 
to u e. Alcohol does bring the dan-
ger of drunk driving, but ilie statis-
tics show that, in reality, most 
young people are wise about Du!. 

There's also the simple fact iliat 
21 is a nonsensical age at which to 
differentiate people. When people 
enter college, all bets are off - if 
they want to drink, iliey'll drink. 
Alcohol is easy to procure and 
deeply embedded in college culture. 
By 21, most people have been in 
college or at least out of ilieir par-
ents' house for several years, and 
iliey simply move their drinking to 
bars, restaurants and clubs. At 
UC D, I -year-olds can drive a few 
rrules to Tijuana for a legal night of 
drinking, taking business to anoilier 
country and a dangerous border 
town because this country's drinking 
age is so awkward and arbitrary. 

The potential danger of alcohol 
cannot be underestimated, and it's a 
shame iliat any person has died from 
its direct or indirect effects. The cur-
rent alcohol law, however, aren't 
doing anything to I11lnimize ilie dan-
ger of alcohol; rather. ilieyare exac-
erbating many of its wor t risks. 

continued from page 5 
help. Knowing Gis half the barrie. 
Let me just convi nce you that you 
are annoying, and then we'll go 
from there about what to do 
about it. 

When you say things that you 
iliink are funny, is there a momen-
taty pause in ilie conversation? 
That's people taking the time out 
of their busy schedule of talking to 
iliink to themselves, "Goddamn, 
iliat guy's annoying." Do you tell 
stories that go on for quite some 
time with little or no resolution, 
and that resolution isn't funny to 
anybody listeni ng? Do people 
quickly change ilie topic of con-
versation after your stories? If you 
answered yes to any of these ques-
tions, chances are, you're annoy-
ing. 

Another good way to tell is 
catch phrases. Catch phrases are 
funny things that funny people 
say. Funny people often engineer 
these phrase from songs, movies 
and television, and when they 
introduce iliem into their normal 
conversations. they become funny 
and hence, are used for quite 
some time, usually a period of one 
to two months. Have you ever 
been the first to pioneer a catch 
phrase among your group of 
friends} Do people groan when 
you use this catch phrase? This is 
a possible indicator that you're 
annoying. Do people groan when 
you use other people 's catch 
phrases? This is a definite indica-
tor that you're annoying. Funny 
people know when catch phrases 
have "played their course" and 
expire them immediately. 
Annoying people do nor seem to 
have this ability.

Now ilia! you know that you're 
annoying, you can now begin me 
process of becoming not annoy-

ing. Instead of committing suicide 
or beating your elf up about it, 
take pride in me fact that the 
majority of annoying people don't 
realize that they 're arUloying and 
make no attempt to stop being 
annoying. 

The first thing you have to do 
is stop tryi ng to be funny. This 
can be difficult, because many 
times in a conversation you'll 
think something is funny and 
want to say it. Don't. Resist the 
urge to speak. Make friends with 
funny people. Starr li stening to 
what other people say. and when 
people laugh, and you may begin 
to understa nd what is actually 
funny. 

When you begin to reali ze 
what is funny and what isn't. you 
may then feel the urge to copy 
what people are saying. Try to 
avoid this as well. The only way 
this can be succe sfully done i to 
divide your friends into two 
groups of people and constandy 
relay the funny things being said 
from one group to another, giv-
ing the impre sion that you're 
funny when you're not. Instead, 
try to develop your own brand of 
humor, but not so much yours 
that it is once again, unnll1ny and 
annoying. If this doesn't work, 
come to the elf-realization that 
you 're not funny, you never will 
be funny, and you shoild stop try-
ing to be funny. It is far better to 
be regarded as "quiet" than 
"fucking annoying." 

And if you really feel that you 
can't stop trying to be funny, you 
need to make sure you stay the 
hell away from me.

Derby Days raises funds for children 
Campus Greeks swing for 48 hours 

By BEN BARTLETT 
Contributing Writer 

Campus Greeks sought to raise 
money and goods May 14 on 
Library Walk as part of Sigma 
Chi's annual Derby Days philan-
thropy drive. 

Rotating between members of 
Igma Chi and affiliated sorori-

ties, students pledged to swing for 
a non-stop 48 hours, a tradition 
dating back to 1933 . 

The event is intended to raise 
attention for the so-called Derby 
Day, a yearly compromise for a 
week of philanthropic work where 
fraternity and sorority members 
perform various fund-raisers ded-
icated to giving back to the com-
muruty. 

One Derby Day event held 
this year wa a sorority-run can 
drive, In which various sororities 
competed to donate the mo t 
canned goods. 

"This is a huge annual event 
for us," said Kris Chi les, the 
Sigma Chi Derby Day's chairman. 
"We really enjoy doing things that 
are excellent for the community. 
It's a persona [of our fraternity] 
that doesn't normally get repre-
sented." 

The money raised through the 
Derby is donated to the Children's 
Miracle Network, a local organi-
zation that provides medical care 
in- San Diego for children who 
otherwise could not afford it. 

This year, Sigma Chi hopes to 
raise $5,000 for the Children's 
Miracle etwork. On May 13 
alone, the Derby raised $2,000, a 
sum significantly larger than the 
$ I ,3 74 r3lSed over the entire week 

Sarah ~GuorrJion 
Giving "-cle Soronty members participated in a canned food drive to be 
donated to San Diego Food Bank as part of Derby Days on May 14. 
in 2002. 

Clothes and canned foods are 
also collected throughout the cam-
paign, with the clothes being sent 
to Goodwill and the cans donated 
to the San Diego Food Bank. 

Sigma Chi had originally 
intended to raise money on May 
14 through a dunk tank, in which 
members of Sigma Chi, as well as 
faculty and staff, would partici-

pate. The dunking had to be 
rescheduled for May 16, however, 
due to the pending weather. 

Further Derby Day events will 
take place throughout the week. 
On May 16, sororities will donate 
school supplies for children in 
Afghanistan . Members of the 
Greek community will paint over 
graffiti around San Diego on May 
17.

College Republicans 
petition for Davis recall 
UCSD club members l·oin in 
statewide signature col ection 

By EVAN McLAUGHUN 
News Editor 

The College Republicans at 
UCSD have joined a statewide 
effort to recall Gov. Gray Davis, 
which has garnered over 100,000 
signatures thus far. 

"This recall is necessary; we 
need a new governor," said Sixth 
College freshman Sendhil 
Panchadsaram, a member of the 
College Republicans at UCSD. 
"Davis has done a bad job for 
California." 

The recall effort, which started 
at a Sacramento, Calif., radio sta-
tion in February, is being orga-
nized through an organization 
called People's Advocate. The state 
constitution mandates that I ° per-
cent of the registered voters in 
California, or 897,156 signatures, 
must be collected by early 
September for a recall election to 
take place. Over 100,000 signatures 
have been gathered and confirmed, 
People's Advocate said. 

More than 100 signatures have 
been gathered at UCSD since May 
5, organizers said . College 
Republicans at UCSD believe the 
recall effort is important to 
Californians and UC students 
alike. 

"On top of California having a 
budget deficit bigger than aU of the 
other states combined, he has 
raised student fees and cutS educa-
tional programs," Panchadsaram 
said. "If Davis did his job, we 
wouldn't have to this." 

In his May revision of the 2003-
04 state budget, Davis estimated 
the state's shortfall to total S38 bil-
lion, while proposing a S300 mil-
lion cut to the University of 
California'S base funding. The May 
budget revision also included a UC 
student fee increase. 
Undergraduates would pay an extra 
S795 per year while graduate stu-
dent fees would be increased by 
$855 per year. If the proposed 
increase is passed by the UC Board 
of Regents, resident undergradu-
ates would pay $1,200 more in sys-
temwide student fees than in 2001-
02 . 

In the event that the sufficient 
number of signatures is gathered, a 
recall election would be held 60 to 
80 days after the date of certifica-
tion once the Cali fornia Secretary 
of State has verified the legitimacy 
of the signatures collected. The 
recall election would consist of two 
questions: The first question would 
ask whether Davis should be 
recalled . The second question 
would ask who voter would like to 
be elected the new governor of 
California the day after the elec-
tion is certified. 

Local Congressman Dan Is a, 
R-Vista, has contributed more than 
$100,000 to the recall campaign. 

Since 2001-02, the University 
of California has forgone almost $1 
billion in funding due to state bud-
get cuts. 

Phone calls made to Davis 
spokespersons were not returned 
by press time. 

Gallagher: Finegold criticizes president for taking stance on issue 
continued /Tom page I 

"I don't think that leads to a 
fair election. A debate IS supposed 
to be back and forth between the 
twO sides, and to have someone 
come in and u e their position of 
power to advocate one of the SIdes 
IS not appropriate and does not 
lead to a faIr debate," Femgold 
sa Id . 

James Lynch, ch3lr of the 
L'nl\er~lty enters AdVISOry 
Board, spoke m favor of the refer-
endum dUring the debate and 
defended Gallagher's deciSIOn .

stance," Lynch said. "He's a public 
figure and everyone should know 
what he has to say on it, and I 
think everyone should take a 
stance. " 

From the stage, Gallagher 
encouraged students to vote 
regardless of their stance - before 
announcing the he per onally 
would be voting in favor of the ref-
erendum being passed - and out-
lined three reasons why he was 
choosing to vote yes. 

The fi rst expressed the need to 
move IncO bigger locations as the 
~tudent body expanded over the 

coming years. 
The second was that this was a 

"student-initiated" referendum. 
"The body that controls the 

building is two-thirds students, and 
so students do have the voting 
power on what the building looks 
lik.e and what it will shape to be," 
Gallagher said, adding that the fee 
would be covered by financial aid 
for eligible students. 

The third was that if the refer-
endum passe, the Cros -Cultural 
Cencer would move to a permanem 
space rather than stay in a tempo-
rary facility.

ill also want to promise that if 
the referendum passes, I will playa 
strong role in making sure that the 
new student union is everything 
that is oudined in the referendum 
wording," Gallagher said. 

Following his speech, Gallagher 
maintained that it was a "bad idea" 
for 'sociated tudem to have 
passed a resolution . 

ill dunk A.S. does have an impact 
on students," Gallagher aid. "This 
has them question what are they 
doing and why are they doing this, 
so hopefully it got people to look 
more IntO It, if noth.ing else." 

Gallagher added that he would 
have taken a stance on the issue 
whether Associated Students had 
passed a resolution or not. 

Monitors of the student voting 
proces had recorded that over 18 
percent of UCSD's student popula-
tion had already voted on whether 
or not to pass ti,e referendum as of 
May 14 at 3 p.m. 

Voting on tudentLmk end 
May 16, with a 20 percent voter 
turnout rate needed to validate the 
special election -' results . The 
turnout i expected to exceed that 
of the 2003 general elections.

there, he continued to push fo r-
ward with hi co nscious lyrics 
abollt everyday life, preaching 
about the posi ti ves of hlp-hop 
II1stead of glorifyi ng the "gangsta"

By CLAYTON WORFOLK 
Associate Hiatus Editor 

For those who like a little punk rock with their un God booz-ery, A.S . Programming has 
snagged Los Angeles vets Bad 
Religion to co-headline this year's 
festlval on May 16. 

It's not often that a band - a 
punk rock band, at th.at - hits its 
mainstream stride decades after 
forming; yet somehow Bad 
Religion has been able to pull It off. 
Sure, the band's gone through its 
share of label changes, persorunel 
rearrangements and , of course, 
many an accusation of "selling 
out," but even after over 20 years in 
the business, Bad Religion'S 
integrity remains intact. And their 
mlisic still kicks ass.

for outstanding unsigned Latin-
American band. Mter thl win , 
Allison signed Kinky to onic360, 
his London-based label. The band 
went on to produce their debut, 
self-titled album. 

Since their debut, the band has 
toured aU over, bwlding a reputation 
and making a name for themselves; in 
2001, the band tOured 10 Columbia, 
France, Mexico and England. 

Kinley goes beyond the usual 
ShakiralRlcky Martin style of Latin 
music. Muong electronic beats With 
alternative music, the band pro-
VIdes beats and rhythms that get 
you dancing withm 10 seconds of 
the song's 1I1troductJon. The trum-
pets, bass and drum beats in their 
musIc won't have you silting still 
for very long. While their name 

may be Kinky, their lyrics actually 
consist of innocent love. Take for 
exampl e, "Soun Tha Mi Primer 
Amor" which translates 10 "You 're 
My FirSt Love" - singmg about 
your first love is not exactly lcinley. 
Although they sing of puppy love 
and aspeCts of Monterrey life, the 
lyrics are still wildly infecoous. 

Kmky is well known for putting 
on amazing shows. Various reviews 
rave about the bands abiliry [Q get 
even the blandest person up and 
danclllg in a matter of minutes. 
The band truly entertains a crowd. 
Rather than JUSt plaYIng the instru-
ments, the band 1I1volves them-
selves with the audience, swapping 
1I1struments at random, and truly 
getting mvolved With the mu IC 
they're playlllg, giving each song 
new meaning and life.

were not yet born when Bad 
Religion first broke onto (or, 
depending on who you ask, creat-
ed) the '80s SoCal hardcore scene. 
Proem definitely doesn't sound like 
something crafted by a bunch of 
dudes pushing 40. In fact, ironical-
ly enough, it sounds a hell of a lot 
fresher than anything put out by 
MTV pop-punk poster children 
Sum 41, Good Charlotte, et al. 

To make matters all the better, 
Proem marks Bad Religion's return 
to seminal independent punk label 
Epitaph Records. Fittingly, it was 
Bad Religion guitarist and song-
writer Brett Gurewitz (who 
returned to the band for Procm 
after a nearly 10-year hiatus) who 
founded the label, and it was Bad 
Religion, itself, that gave Epitaph 
early credit as one of the first SoCal 
labels dedicated to punk rock. 

Bad Religion emerged from the 
suburban San Fernando Valley - if 
SoCal punic has taught us anything, 

it's that suburbs equal angst - in 
1980. After fonning the band and 
penning some tunes, princi pal 
members Gurewitz, vocalist Greg 
Graffin and bassist Jay Bendey hit 
the L.A. hardcore dive circuit and 
released a self-tided, painfully lo-Ii 
EPin 1981. 

In 1982, the band released its first 
full-length album. Huw Could HtfJ Bt 
Any WorSt?, a classic epitomizing not 
only the Bad Religion sound, but the 
direction of SoCal pook rock to 
come. At the same time, by fusing 
fast, overdriven punk rock guitar 
with equally incendiary, polltically-
laced lyriCS delivered in a trademark 
sing-song manner, the band crafted a 
style that is to this day uniquely 
theirs. Two of HIlUJ Could Htlls beSt 
tracks, "We're Only Gonna Die"

Beston and the 
Kitchen to play 

between headliners. 
By JESSICA KRUSKAMP 

Senior Staff Writer 

B eston and the Kitchen may be playing on the second stage at this year's Sun God festival , but that's not even close 
to being on the back burner. Instead, the 
tage will simmer with the smooth stew of 

funk, soul, hip-hop and samba. 
Beston, 29, is a Nashville, Tenn., native, 

but his musical style blends an assoronent of 
tastes. The local musical culture o( his boy-
hood and deep musical influences that he 
discovered in his parents record collections 
resulted in a true musical l11ultirasker. 
Beston's gigs have found him tampering with 
the guitar, tinlcering with the bass and piano, 
and projecting his powerful voice. 

His first solo album, Chrysolis, coupled 
blues, jazz and acoustics. Beston explored the 
songwriring customs of rap music and culti -
va ted a heady, fuji album. This musical the-
sis of sorts earned Beston the 1999

Award. 200 I 's effort, 1/(1IJ) to Pass Wonder On,

Malibu favorites

They' re one of the most popular unknown bands out there. Even though you probably haven't heard 
of them, White Starr has been playing in 
Malibu, Cali f., to packed shows full of 
devoted fans for ages. H ailed as the band 
to bring back classic rock 'n' roll , White 
Starr has become notorious for perform-
ing concerts full of beautiful fans, and for 
throwing killer afrer-parries. 

Many people are skeptical of music 
that originates out of Malibu , bur the 
music world is paying close attention.

Sun God for the uninitiated: a 
first timers guide to the festival 
Know the ins and outs of UCSD's favorite 
annual event - lest you be vomited upon 

By JESSICA KRUSKAMP 
Senior Staff Writer 

vcryone knows that the posters advertis-
ing the Sun God festival are like those 
mysterious inkblot psychology tests . 

That fabulously colored chickcn-esque 
object that wallpapers the campus every year 
come springtime COllllllUll icates much more 
than simple, pede trian information . 

No, tha t poster of the chicken thi ng 
(rooster? un God by ikki St. De Phalle? 
Fauvist Loch ess Monster?) is not an 
Inkblot test. 

Listen, all those newbies out there: That 
poster promislIlg a festi\'al to pay homage to 
a SUIl God (mohawk-headed fo\\ I with a bad 
styl l ~ 1 ') I ~ far more th,lt a mere advcrti~e­
ment. Thi, poster represents UC D' ver-

are unable to recall much else about the event. 
Evcn the veterans of Sun God do not know 

all the ropes of the festival, as large blocks of 
time were somehow lost in an inebriated time 
warp. Further, thcre are more than a few hard-
ened cynics skeptical about UCSD's ability to 
sponsor a day slightly more fun than the annu-
al bone marrow drive. 

But, there are everal preparations that 
wi ll make the day even more enjoyable than 
those inkblots/posters claim. These small 
step aim to win over evcn the most con-
temptuous critics and case the transition 
from the waddled babes of the festival to the 
veteran Sun Gods and Goddesses. 

First and foremost, the pracocaltty of Sun 
God and thc crux of the event is thc snldent 
status: Bring that student TD card . Tt not only 
allows free entrance, which is always better 
than cheap, but it I11Jght havc that all impor-
tant TritOn Taxi sticker on the back of It. If one 
were to plan ahead and get one, that IS. 

Do not forget those dollar btlb. T t would be

pricey. ForewJrning 1\ powerful - no one

A reflection on the haze of 
past Sun God experiences 

Music, mayhem and memories: this is 
really what college is all about after all 

don't pop 

Rinaldo Dorman 
t is finally here: my la t Sun God. After 
five years at this chool, I'm going to 
graduatc - or elsc just give up and move 

on. In any case, I won't be back for morc. [ 
can't say that I've been all too thrilled with 
past musical experiences, but the day and its 
accompanying drunken insanity is another 
matter alrogether. JUSt likc school, wherc if 
you've done things right, YOll don't remem-
ber the classes. but rather tl1e good times; 

un od I much less about the forgetable 
ba nd that no one you know rca lly listens too 
than ule opporrunity to get together with the 
majority of UC D. 

What is otherwi e an uptight student 
body, disposed to go home every weekend, 
suddenly remember that college offer you 
some of the rarest opportunines in life. We 

are finally old enough to know how to mis-
behave, and we are still young enough for our 
bodies to let us get away with It. 

Its not like I'm advoCilting the u c of liquor 
and drugs". well, maybe I am. It does certain-
ly help, but what tlli, is rt!JJly about IS our col-
lective need to have a good time. Don't drink? 
\ .... '110 cares? Ju t for one sweet moment, stop 
thinking about your far 19hted goals of med 
school or law school, and go see a fuckin' show. 

ure I can hardly remember the mu ic por-
tion of most years, but this one \vill be differ-
em. 1 actually own mo t of the albums by one 
of the headliners! Imaginc that. Bad Religion, 
besides offering the mild offense factor to the 
overly prude Christian population (0 mo t 
peoplc here?), is a damn good band, at least in 
my not-very-punk opinion. [ realized that 1 
nlight have to be sober enough to see the show 
this time armmd, but that does leave me many 
hours beforehand, and after, to abuse my liver. 

My first few Sun God experiences are not 
much to talk about, 1 didn't even attend my 
second year. J unior year is mostly a blur, I can 
only vaguely remember bei ng bored and wait-

do they do thi~ ? 
With some fre -

to uch of hlp-

Even big rockers W<e 
Tommy Lee and 

Puddle of Mudd will 
stand by and listen 
with happy ear ." 

imHge, they take 
painstaking ca re to 
produce serious rock 
music for seriou s 
rock fans . 

These guys aren't 
just performcrs, they 
also stand for J C:1lJ~C : 
the rtght to good 
musIc and great par-

hop breakbeats. 
v,'hat's really impressive is that 
they can still produce serious 
music with a big-bellied middle-
aged guy dancing his way around 
the stage. 

Back some time ago (White 
Starr is mysterious about things 
like that), isco Kid met 
Coloured Plastic when they went 
head to head in a free tyle rap 
tournament. They became friends 
and started out o'n the long jour-
ney to where they are today. ot 
long after Ci co Kid witnessed 
Kid KaSh performing at a temple 
where he fused gospel and 
lIebrew music, KaSh joined the 

ties. And thus being 
the mariJuana fans 

that th ey arc, 'vVhne Starr also par-
tiCIpates lJl concerts and Fromo-

So even though you probablr 
haven't heard of them and they 
sound and look lIke they are really 
weird, give them a listen when they 
perform at Sun God and you mIght 
be surprISed when you like their 
brand of infectious classic rock 'n' 
roll.

Just a punk rock song: Bad Religion's live shows are legendary both for 
Intense mosh,plt madness and crowd slng·alongs. 
Religion opted to go major, signing 
to Atlantic Records in a controver-
sial move for the very independent-
ly-oriented band members and its 
fans. However, the move paid off, 
to some degree at least, as Stranger 
Than Fiction, the band 's mo t popu-
lar album to that date, climbed to 
87 on the charts on the back of Bad 
Religion 'S first radio hit, "Infected." 

Subsequent releases, such as The 
Gray Race and No Substo1lCe, were 
met with similar mass approval, but 
by this time the band 's music was 
suffering from the loss of one of its 
key components, Gure~tz, who 
agajn left the band to focus more on 
his burgeoning Epitaph label. 
Minor Threat guitarist Brian Baker 
took the reigns at second guitar, 
and it was not be until 20025 Process 

release that the band's origi nal 
members would reunite and kick 
Atlantic to the curb, much to the 
delight of the bands followers . 

It is no surprise then that 
Pr{J{ess has become Bad Religion's 
most popular album to date. 
Bolstered by the signarure track 
"Sorrow," Process is a rerurn to the 
band's s trai ghtforward, punk-
rockin' roots, albeit, thIS time 
around with a powerful, if a trifle 
unnecessary, three-gllitar backing. 

A live Bad Religion show has 
always been something to behold, 
but to catch the band at the peak 
of its triumphanr, co rporate-
snubbing comeback will no doubt 
be an experience for drunk punks 
and new converts alike to remem-
ber.

16 HIATU THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

TH 
First: Shoes, multiple personalities are musts 

contlm~ed from page 13 
wants the festival to get 1999 
Woodstock-violent. 

Wear hoes! stated above, 
this i not Woodstock. and no one 
wants it to be. A festival does not 
nece arily mean dirty bare feet 
frolicking through pastoral hills. 
Plus, it's a jungle out there on 
RIMAC field, with po ible mine-
fields of broken glass. Of course, 
to hop around on anything inflat-
ed, such as a bouncy castle or 
something of the sorts, take them 
off. 

Alter that state of mind. That's 
right, bring patience and ambiva-
lence to un God . Patience is cru-
cial because people stumble and 
yell a lot, both of which can get 
rather trying. Basic ambivalence 
(nothing tOO intense) is required 

because bands have been known 
to insult the audience by calling it 
something along the lines of 
"mainstream radio laves" who 
"have no idea what music is" and 
"will punish the audience by play-
ing a twangy country song" 
(2002's Sun God had its Cake and 
ate it too). The ambivalence helps 
when performers get too big for 
their britches and need to be dealt 
some of their own medicine. 

While it sounds a bit exces-
sive, different personalities may 
be in order. With such a wide 
array of music and activities, 
more than one personali ty is 
needed just to experience it all. 
Bring that inner rave child out 
for the club tem. Become ghetto 
fabulous when hip-hop hits the 
stage. Don't forget your hidden 

punk - punk is on the inside 
after all - when the fir t strains 
of vintage Bad Religion waft over 
the field . 

Stain-resistant clothing is one 
important item that may slip the 
mind. Dirt, grass, mud and vomit 
are like bounty hunters for clean 
clothing. Leave the silks and cash-
meres at home. Further, put more 
clothes on. Tube tops and jersey 
tOpS are not the most practical of 
digs for an outdoor concert. 
Remember this is not Cancun, its 
RIMAC field at night, outdoors, 
in the cold. 

Finally, arrive with pessimism 
and leave with fulfilled hopes. 
Expecting too much will 
inevitably lead to let down. It is 
much more satisfying to be pleas-
antly surprised. 

Sheep: Stumbling down memory lane 
conunued {rom page 13 

ing to get an interview with Face to 
Face, which I never got. 
Afterwards, I ran into several then-
editors rolling in the GUllrdill7l 
office. This brief encounter radical-
ly changed my perspecove of both 
UCSD and Sun God. Suddenly, I 
realized that there were kids run-
ning around having a good time, 
and funhermore, using a concen 
they didn 't even go to as an excuse 
to cu t loose. 

Last yeu 's Sun God, what 
should have been my final Sun 
God, held expectations that were a 
little higher. There was an honest 

arrempt [0 see Cake, but again, I 
was there for about half a set 
before boredom et in, and some-
one mentioned , "We could be 
drinking now." 0 we filed out past 
the rave tent with kids pretending 
to candy rave, past the droves of 
people showing up at the end and 
headed back out to find a refuge, a 
safe harbor for consumption and 
inebriation. And possibly napping. 

My friend have a.\ready planned 
out a striCt regimen that begins at 
the dark and early hour of 6 a.m., 
and will likely last uninterrupted 
until I decide to wander off and 
sleep for an hour or two. Maybe 

we'll wander through the booths 
and look for the legendary Jell -O 
shots, or the girls who were making 
out last year. Maybe we won't 
"lose" my friend after he berates us 
for keeping the yellow man down. 
Maybe we'll actually show up for 
the opening bands. 

But I digress, if by now you're 
questioning the point to this ram-
bling stumble down foggy memory 
lane, it i this: You may not know it 
now, but this time here i precious. 
Do you really want to look back on 
your college life and only be able to 
remember studying and doing 
homework?

Variety of Sun God booths

Staff Writer 

Before checking out the music at Sun God, be sure to stop by Library Walk, Price 
Center P laza and the Sun God 
lawn [0 take a look at the vari-
ety of booths. 

Many student organiza-
tions will feature informa-
tional booths, such as 
political organizations 
like the College 
Democrats, Campus 
Greens and Coll ege 
Republicans. There will 
also be informational 
booths from the UCSD 
Sailing Team, the Ballroom 
Dance Club and the Mambo 
Club. 

But don't think it will be all 
work and no play. Various 
clubs will also have game 
booths. The Pre-Medical 
Association of Students for 
Service will feature a booth with 
"Pin the Organ on the Plastic 
Body," while the Pep Band will 
have you bobbing for prizes. The 
Sikh Student Association will fea-
ture a balloon dart game, while 

the Society for Creative 
Anachronism will have you joust-
ing in their Medieval Fighting 
Demonstration. Campus Crusade 
for Christ will get back to Biblical 

roots with its feet-washing 
booth, while SRTV will 
host a game booth featur-

ing Astro Jump. 
But the fun doesn't 

I \ stop there! Carnival-
style games wi 11 also 

be available throughout the 
day. The All-Campus 
Transfer Association will host 
a bungee run, while 
B.O .A.R.D. at UCSD will 
have a dunk tank. 

After you've worked up 
an appetite, head on over 
to one of the many food 
booths that will be avail -

able . Everything from 
Turkish food to barbecue 
chicken [0 caramel apple will 
be available to snack on 
throughout the day. 

So be sure to take orne time to 
enjoy yourself, playa game, grab a 
snack and check out the festivities. 
The fun begins at 10:00 a.m., so if 
there was ever a day to skip class, 
this would be it.

his work to The Kitchen, a 

an Diego-based band . 
known for their fiery music. 

The Kitchen is like a 
United Nations of musical 
influences. Jazz drummer 
Gabried Damaceno is a gradu-
ate of the powerful Brazilian 
school lmperatriz, which is one 
of Brazil's most decorated music 
schools. Alejandro Galindo han-
dles the congas with a certain

a drum like he can. Si ngers 
Stephanie Hentz and Marnie Havert 

harmonize whi le the gospel-singing 
bassist Joe Hilgeman is reportedly 
one of the funkiest bass players to 
come from Guam. 

Needless to say, this is a buffet of 
musical genres. Ranging from West 
Coast hip-hop to Cuban congas and 

Brazilian samba. 
Many of the runes that 

will be heard during the 
S,m God festivities are off 
Beston's 2002 release On 6-

with producer Los Angeles 
Rafi Benjamin, who is known 
for his work with acoustic

labels sniffing around Maxeen's 
shows. A live track of Maxeen 
ounds as if these boys ha ve been

Los Angeles' Side O ne Dummy 

Records and Glendale's Five Finger 
Management snapped Maxeen up

Maxeen is actually worth waiting

HIATUS 17 

'I'm not as think as you drunk I am' 
Know the law (and your rights) this Sun God 
By CLAYTON WORFOLK 

Associate Hiatus Editor 

Almost as inevitable as the booths, bounce houses and bands at UCSD's annual Sun 
God festival is the booze. Year 
after year, the day-long event 
manages to bring Out the inner 
college student in all of us - the 
one that is otherwise repressed by 
organic chemistry, shut-in room-
mates and La Jolla's disdain for 
student housing (who really wants 
a college town, anyway?). 

The debauchery that accompa-
nies Sun God is no secret - with 
surefire student intoxication comes 
an inevitable police presence 
throughout the day. By knowing 
your rights and recognizing (if not 
adhering to) the law, however, even 
the most incapacitated freshman 
can minimize the probability of an 
unwanted encounter with the fuzz. 

"[Intoxication is] typically 
what we run into a lot," said 
UCSD Police Officer John Smart. 
"People enjoy the day with some 
adult beverages, and then come 
out of their apartments or dorms." 

Drunk in public and minor in 
possession violations are two of 
the most common Sun God 
infractions. According to 
California penal code, drunk in 
public violations are reserved for 
those found to be " in such a con-
dition that he or she is unable to 
exercise care for his or her own 

safety or the safety of others," 
while MIPs go to those under 21 
who are found possessing alcohol. 

Those detained for a drunk in 
public violation may be taken to 
detox, regardless of their age. The 
perpetrator is charged for the offi-
cer's time, and, if he or she is a stu-
dent, a report of the incident is sent 
to a residential or academic dean. 

" If we could go 
through the entire 

event without making 
one arrest, we'd be 

overjoyed. " 
- UCSD Police SefINIII Dave 

Rose 

MIPs typically result in a $250 fine 
or 24 hours of community service 
and, potentially, a year-long revoke 
of the minor's license. 

Most police action is the result 
of a disturbance, either witnessed 
by an officer or reported to the 
police and not solicited by offi-
cers, according to UCSD Police 
Sergeant Dave Rose. 

"Contrary to popular belief, 
we're not out to bust people," 
Rose said. "If we could go through 

the entire event without making 
one arrest, we'd be overjoyed ." 

Yet a good number of violations 
arc sure to be sporred when so siz-
able a portion of the populace is 
under the infl uence. So, students 
should know their rights for dealing 
with officers in such cases. 

Students are not required to 
answer an officer's questions or 
confess, nor are officers allowed to 
enter a student's on-campus dorm 
or apartment room unless the offi-
cer believes there to be an emer-
gency, according to Commissioner 
of Student Advocacy Brie Finegold. 
However, it is not advisable to Slll1-
ply hide or ignore an officer, saId 
Finegold. Instead, students have 
the option of closing their door and 
tallcing with the officer outside 
their room. 

Furthermore, an officer must 
have "reasonable suspicion" to 
detain an individual for question-
ing or citation . Officers look for 
such objective drunk in public 
symptoms as slurred speech, a 
staggering gait or pas ing Ollt in 
determining suspicion. 

Ten officers, three sergeants, a 
contingent of ci ty officers and a col-
lege alcohol task force will be Ollt in 
full force for the un God concert, 
according to Rose. In addition, an 
increased number of UCSD police 
officers will be making the rounds 
during the day and Residennal 
Security Officers will be on patrol 
early for the event.

There is a cliffhanger, but the 
ending is muddled and anti-climac-
tic. The sequel seems more of a 
serup for the next film more than 
existing as a film in itself. 

"Mao'ix Reloaded" has an infe-
ri on ty complex; it tries ro pull out 
all the bells and whistles in an 
attempt to outdo (he first film. 
This leads to more action and less 
tory, which i not necessarily a bad 

thing, but you leave the theater 
more with a whimper than a bang, 
unlike the original "Matnx."

had recovered from Friday night's 
activities, they're in for another 
beating. The biggest name in hip-
hop and the entire 2003 music 
scene, 50 Cent, is coming to 
RlMAC Arena for a stop on his 
nationwide tour. UCSD, which 
has lacked many rap tours since 
Wyclef Jean , De La Soul and 
Black Eyed Peas came two and a 
half years ago, has shown it's 
appreciation by elling OU[ the 
event just days after tickets were 
released . 

50 Cent's image as one who has 
grown up selling drugs to survive 
has been embraced by the hip-hop 
society because he has the scars to 
show for it. He was kicked out of 
high school for po sessing drugs 
while on school grounds. 50 took 
his advance from the first record 
deal he signed and bought drugs. 
His son was just born, so 50 need-
ed the money to provide for his 
new family. l ie initially tried to 
get mto the rap bu iness a few 
years ago wiul the help of Jam 
Master Jay, but his record label 
ended up never releasing his 
album, PfTW,r of Ib, Do/Iilr. 

A few days before 50 was to 
shoot his first music video of the 
album with Destiny's Child, he 
was shot tunc times while sitting 
in the back of a frIend 's car. The 
dimple that he has on the left side 
of hIS face IS the result of one of 
the wounds; this one had the bul-

let entering in his cheek, knocking 
out a tooth, and coming to rest in 
his mouth . 

A year ago, 50, whose real name 
is Curtis Jackson, was the biggest 
thing in the New York under-
ground hip-hop scene, but was a 
relative unknown in mainstream 
hip-hop. After rehabbing from the 
gunshot wounds, 50 came back 
onto the scene through the route of 

ew York City mix tapes. 

" 

Club" and "21 Questions" being 
mainstays on MTV's TRL, along 
with BET's 106 & Park. 

In addi tion to his own record, 
every other artist seems to want a 
piece of 50 Cent. It is tough to 
turn on the radio now over a 30-
minute span withoU[ hearing 50 
rapping at least once. He has 
worked with artists such as Justin 
Timberlake, Missy Elliot, 
Eminem, Busta Rhymes, Lil' Kim, 

Snoop Dogg, The 
Notorious B.I.C . 
and Tupac 

Eventually, one of 
his record made 
it \; way to the desk 
of Eminem. 50' 
style was complete-
ly fresh to 
Emincm, and he 
wanted to sign him 
as soon as he could. 
I Ie got 50's single, 
"Wanksra," on the 
"S Mi le" sound-
track, so he could 
introduce him to 
the mainstream 
ma es. 

Hip-hop and UCSD 
don't usually go 

together, so this is a 
rare opportunity for 
RIMAC to house 
two of the biggest 
names in rap right 

hakur. Also, 50 
Cent will hit the 
road this summer 
with Jay-Z, which 
will have the pos-
sibility of the 
biggest hip-hop 
tour since 2000's 
Up In Smoke 
Tour. In his spare 
time, 50 was able 
to put together 
"The ew 
Breed," 
DVD/CD that " 

On Feb. 6, 
2003 , 50 Cent 
finally got his own 

now. 

album released on 
ShadylInterscope Records. Within 
5 days, he had sold in excess of 
872,000 COpIes of the album, which 
is a record for a debut artist's first 
week sales since May 1991 , when 
those figures beg:m to be docu-
mented. Since then, the album has 
become a regular of the top five 
weekly album sales and has com-
bined to sell over 4.5 million 
records in a little over three 
months. Suburban hip-hop fans 
hal'e found his life very appeal ing, 
as evidence from SOS videos, "In Da 

tells the story of 
him growing up, along with intro-
ducing his fans to his group, G-
Unit. 

50 Cent is 31 0 bringing along 
Xzibit to rock the house. This will 
be Xzibit's second trip (0 UCSD 
in almost two years. He headlined 
the 2001 un God festival and is 
now coming back with 2 albums 
relea ed since then. Xzibit has not 
been heard from for a while, 
except for a cameo in the movie "8 
Mile," but if hIS performance at 

Ull God was any indication, he

with the sound of the first note. 
Kzibit, a native of Detroit, is 

actually one of the few big names 
tha t represent for the West Coast 
rap scene. Using the blueprint set 
forth by Dr. Ore, NWA, Snoop 
Dogg and so many others before 
him, Xzibit is able to use "g-funk" 
and bass-heavy beats to meet his 
rap strengths to become one of the 
all -stars of the music. HIS most 
recent album, 2002 's Man Vtrms 
Machin" used the West Coast for-
mula to produce the radio fu ts of 
"Multiply" featuring ate Dogg, 
and "Symphony in X Major" fea -
turing Dr. Ore. 

Hip-hop and UCSD don't usu-
ally go together, so this is a rare 
opportunity for RIMAC to house 
two of the biggest names in rap 
right now. The differences in 
styles of East and West Coast 
should mesh perfectly and, given 
these two arost's abilities, no one 
should go home disappointed. 

conrlnued {rom page I I 
Pope chastise their more blingin' 
peers for "keepmg it real, when you 
should oy keeping it right." The 
debut was received well , particular-
ly by Bay Area hip-hop heads and 
college radio. 

Mission: went through some-
what of an identity crisis. First, the 
band was nearly stranded in the 
Midwest on a tour when the 
events of Sept. 11 led to the can-
cellation of several key shows. ot 
long after making theIr way back 
to the Bay, Mission: had to deal 
with the departure of co-MC 
Pope, when he announced tha t he 
was returning to Boston. 

Finally, Mission: decided to 
rename itself, in recognition of the 
existence of a U.K. Goth-rock 
band of a similar name. T he 
Crown City Rockers seemed a fit -
ting replacement, "Crown City" 
being the nickname of theIr home-
town of Pasadena, Calif. 

Despite hectic time , the band's 
underground , alternative ethos 
remains unphased. MC Ahmad IS 
still bol tered by energetic live 
instrumentation. thanks to a back-
ing band of new and old mUSI-
cians. Bassist Headnodle lays 
down the grooves, drummer Max 
MacVeety keeps time, OJ Walter 
Kitundu mans the turntables, and 
Woodstock and Kat Ouano estab-
lish jazzy melodies on samplers 
and keys, respectively. 

You can catch a free glimpse of 
what is sure to be a promi ing (sec-
ond) debut release on the Sun God 
side tage.

Does the 
• nice guy ever 

win anything 
around here? 

Pum's 

Anu Kumar 
was sitting in class on May 
13 minding my own business 
(watching me clock, really) 

when the professor began [0 say 
something mat actually drew my 
anention from the clock on me 
wall [0 me frOnt of the room. 

"How many of you have heard 
of Leo Durocher?~ he asked us. 

The words woke me up from 
my typical in-lecture nap bener 
man me sound of zipping back-
packs and slamming desks, which 
u ually signal me end of class. 

"J Ie was the second baseman 
for the ... " the professor clued. 
ThiS class JUSt gOt a whole lot 
more Interesting. I thought [0 
my elf. 

. Former baseball player, manag-
er, and hall-of-famer Leo "the Up" 
Durocher IS the man respon Ible 
for the phrase. "Nice guy~ fimsh 
last." \\ 'hat the smooth-fieldlllg 
Il1fielder actuallv aid wa , "The 
mce guy~ are ali over there - III 
seventh place " But what he said 3S 
the Brooklyn Dodger~ manager 
before a game agalllst the hated 
New York Giants 111 1946 lacked 
spice; so SPOrtswriters at me time 
decided that they would change It a 
Iltlle bit LO give us the now-famous 
Ill1e. 

:-':0\\ I can't remember exactlv 
why thiS came up 111 cia s, but 'I 
suppo\e that what Durocher meam 
when he was talkIng about the sev-
enth-place "Nice Guys" can be 
applIed to most things. 

In a poker game, you shouldn't 
tell the guy sltung to your right 
mat you can see his hand. In tead, 
you should use your new kIlOwl-
edge 111 your next betting move. 

In economiCS, you houldn't tell 
everyone about a free lunch. 
lnstead , you should go take all me 
food for yoursel f. 

And In spom, It doesn't help 
you If you go up and tell the ref-
eree that you were the last one to 
touch the ball before 1l went out 
of bounds With under a minute 
left III a one-possessIOn ba~ketba II 
game. It doesn't help If you go 
over lO the ref and tell him that 
you put me puck 1Il[o the cage 
With your sitate and not your 
hockey stick. It doesn't hel p to tell 
me ref that you crossed the IlIle of 
scrimmage before you threw a 
touchdown. 

T he nice guy would make these 
confessions ... and me nice guy 
would then lose. Durocher knew 
what he was talking about. He was-
n't a nice guy, and he got himself 
two World Senes rings as a player, 
one as a manager and a spot in me 
Hall of Fame. 

Although me shortstOp/second 
baseman wasn 't known for his bat 
(he baned above .260 III just five of 
hiS 17 easons) but more for hJS 
glovework, which made Durocher 
an MVP candidate, he would prob-
ably tell you to go IIlto second with 
your spikes up.

malls about his points at adku-

Men's tennis bids farewell to three seniors 
Trio leaves UCSD after making huge impact on program 

By CYNTHIA CHAm 
Staff Writer 

As this spring quarter passes, 
three seniors on the UCSD men's 
tennis team will come to the real-
ization mat wim the conclusion of 
their undergraduate years comes 
the end of a significant part of 
meir lives: collegiate tennis. Gone 
will be me days of intense prac-
tices, road trips and team cama-
raderie a mey forge new paths. 

This year' team will see its 
captain Michael Meyer, Sean 

agel and Doug Hofmann gradu-
ating wim bachelor's degrees in 
management science, biochem-
istry and mechanical and aero-
pace engineering, respectively. 

Their teammate, ophomore 
Bryan Swan, knows the impact 
these seniors ha\'e had. 

a core group of semors, 
[Hofmann, Meyer and agel] 
provided a lot of leadership. They 
were alwars mere to guide u and 
lead u Inspirationally, especially 
In big matche ," watt said. 

UCSD head coach Enc 
leldlmayer willmi two of his first 

recnutS, Nagel and Me 'Cr. 
"For them to Will melr la t 

match of the year, to play together 
all year 1111 double~j, and have such 
a successful eason wa very fun 
for me lOee. They bom have 
heen helpful In gerung Trnon ten-
ms to a much higher le\'el , and Jre 
the best of frIend~," teldlmayer 

said. 
Hofmann is a transfer student 

from Santa Rosa Junior College, 
bringing in twO seasons' worth of 
experience playing at No. I and No. 
2 singles and also earning a top- IO 
ranking in California. Hofmann 
finished 6-4 in singles and is 3-1 in 
doubles in his two-year stint with 
me Tritons. Almough he has not 
improved as much as he would have 
liked due to his demanding work-
load, he says he will miss his team-
mates. His contribution to the team 
will be missed. 

"He has provided a steady influ-
ence on our team," Steidl mayer 
said. "He was not able to get as 
much time as he would like in me 
starting lineup this year, but had a 
great fall eason, breaking into the 
rankings as one of the top 50 play-
ers in the nation. He is a tremen-
dous student ... I think mat he will 
do very well in whatever he choos-
es." 

This MAE major plans to smy at 
UCSD to pursue his lo S. in mate-
rial science and later earn his Ph .D. 
in mechanical and aerospace engi-
neering at 31 Tech. Hofmann has 
set hi ightS on becoming an 3 tro-
naut for NASA.
