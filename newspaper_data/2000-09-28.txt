A' big source of that discom-

UC Will Not Bloc~ Napster 
UCSD ban will remain for now due to system capacity restrictions 
By ANGELA CARRIER 
Staff Writer 

The UC Regents announced last Friday 
that they will not block Napster on UC cam-
puses. However, the move does not affect 
UCSD's decision to block the music-sharing 
utility. 

The regents ' decision not to ban Napster 
comes in response to a request made by 
Howard E. King, attorney for the rock band 
Metallica . King promised lawsuits against 11 
major u,:,ivcrsities if they did not prohibit 
Napster use on their networks. Two of the 
schools contacted by King are UC Berkeley 
and UCLA. 

King claims that students nationwide are 

involved in rampant copyright infringement 
encouraged and Implemenfed by Napster. 

UC General Counsel Jame~ E. Holst stated 
that the reasoning behind not blocking 
Napster systemwide is that the technology 
may be used for legitimate purposes and that 
the university does not m'onitor the use of its 
electronic systems. 

"Just as a copying machine can be used to 
reproduce written works illegally, so can 
Napster be used for illegal purposes. 
However, both also serve many valuable and 
legitimate purposes," said James Dolgonas, 
UC assistant vice president for information 
systems and computing.

Insects Prey 
Upon UCSD's 
Eucalyptus Trees 
Some have already been lost to 
Australian insects 
By JEFFREY II. BARIlER 
Senior Staff Wri ter 

The eucalyptus trees will have to fight 
for their lives without UCSD backup. 

(nsects ravaging San Diego County's 
eucalyptus trees have come to UCSD, and 
there is little anybody can do to help the 
trees.· 

"Nearly every tree I've seen has the red 
lerp psyllid to some degree," said Chuck 
Morgan, UCSD grounds and landscaping 
manager. 

The red gum lerp psyllid, or Glycaspis 
brimblecombei , is an Australian insect 
that was first observed in this region two 
years ago. Since then , the population has 
soared and the devastation of eucalyptus 
trees has reached a level that has many 
worried. 

The psyllids feed on eucalyptus tree 
sap. Young psyllids create a sticky, conical 
shell to deter predators. The shells fall to 
the ground , attracting mold and contribut-
ing to the defoliation of eucalyptus trees. 
Without leaves, trees are susceptible to 
disease. 

"We'll probably lose some eucalyptus 
trees: Morgan said . 

According to Morgan , about a dozen 
trees have been taken down ,over the sum-
mer months partly due to the psyllids. 

The insect is not the worst problem 
UCSD eucalyptus trees face . The eucalyp-
tus bora beetle also contributed to the loss 

• of trees over the summer. Morgan said that 
sudden eucalyptus decline. when leaves 
turn magenta and trees die with unknown 
reasons, is the worst of UCSD's eucalyptus 
worries. 

The red gum lerp psyllid problem 
became -bad enough in the county thai 
experts have been called in . A researcher 
from UC Berkeley, Dr. Donald Dahlsten , is 
releasing wasps in psyllid-infested regions. 
He identified a tiny species of wasp - the 
size of a gnat and harmless to humans -
in Australia as a natural predator of the 
psyllids.

UCSD Assistant Professor Makes Uver Discovery 
Researcher's work with cells may lead .to new treatments for patients suffering from liver disease 
byJAMULD 
Contributing News Writer 

Sangeeta Bhatia, an assistant 
professor at UCSD, and students 
of the Microscale Tissue 
Engineering Library have taken 
the first steps toward discovering a 
more effective liver disease treat-
ment. 

By examining the microenvi-
ronment of liver cells and placing 
them with other supportive cells in 
porous silicon chips, usually used 
to make computer chips. Bhatia 
and her students created a viable 
home for the cells. 

Bioanificial devices used to act 
as a patient's liver during treat-
ment can opefate more efficiently 
due to this treatment, potentially 
leading to safer liver transplants 
and paving the way for engineer-
ing an artificial liver. 

Bhatia's research could lead to 
the fabrication of an artificial liver, 
which could keep patients alive 
while they are waiting for the new 
organ. 

"We adapted technology for 
making computer chips and looked 
to the liver for inspiration,w Bhatia 
said. "We want to trick the cells to 
behave as they would inside the 

liver. But we have just entered the 
early stages of research." 

The usual method to treat liver 
disease involves the use of a dialy-
sis machine, growing liver cells in 
individually etched silicon pores. 
Certain configurations of proteins 
and cells are then tested in a petrie 
dish in an attempt to improve cell 
function . 

(n contrast, Bhatia and profes-
sor of chemistry Michael Sailor's 
research incorporates a new 
approach, the use of electrochem-
ical etching. 

"It's a yery exciting time 
because all this technology is com-

ing together: Bhatia said. "We're 
working at the interface of chem-
istry, biology and more, which is a 
rare thing. (feel that ( can barely 
keep up to this whole new world of 
opportunities." 

Bhatia presented her work at 
the BioMEMS and Biomedical 
Nanotechnology World 2000 con· 
ference Sept. 25 in Columbus, 
Ohio. 

Bhatia foresees that devices 
being built by the biotech industry 
will be using her work in 10 years. 
She hopes her research will help in 
decreasing the number of deaths 
in the U.S. due to liver disease.

Robert J. Blake, a professor of Spanish and

Teaching. 

The organization was created in order to 
make the most effective use of the University of 
California's vast language teaching resources at 
a time when there is a dramatic increase in 
enrollments of foreign language courses, and the 
demand for new areas of language instruction 
are high. Currently, University of California gives 
its students the opportunity to study 78 lan-
guages. 

'Blake received his doctorate in Hispanic lin-

guistics from the University of Texas, AuStin In 
1980 and went to UC Davis in 1992, where he 
served as department chair and director of the 
campus' Second Language Acquisition 
Institute.

"gifts· to the community to commemorate 
UCSD's 40th anniversary. KEYs seeks to inspire 
and empower young women to enter the histori-
cally male-dominated fields of science and engi-
neering. 

Dr. Sangeeta Bhatia , an assistant professor 
of bioengineering and one of the co-founders of 
the program, has been the primary force in 
establishing the outreach program at UCSD. 

The program will hold its first workshop on 
Sept . 30 and will be a jOint effort between the 
Society of Women Engineers-UCSD Chapter 
and the Girl Scouts of San Diego. Initially, 30 
girls will be selected from Horace Mann Middle 
School and National City Middle School. 

OrIgin of sans In the 'dry 
valley.' of Antarctica provide 
clu .. to atmospheric 
deposition on Man 

Chemists at UCSD have discovered that the 
mysteriously high salt concentrations In 
exposed soils of Antarctica's Dry Valley are 
due in large part to biological sulfur emissions 
in the oceans surrounding the continent. 

The 'chemists presented their discovery In 
the Sept. 28 issue of Nature and said that they 
discovered an unmistakable chemical siena· 
ture in soil samples from this Mars-like region. 

The results suggested that atmospheric 
deposition of sulfates from sulfur-emlttlng 
marine algae is a significant contributer to the 
high concentrations in that region. 

The chemists observations could help with 
studying evidence of past Of present life on 
Mars, as well as on understanding the chemi-
cal interactions between the Martian atmos-
phere and the red planet's surface.

Eucalyptus: 
Most of the North 
Campus grove is infected 
ContI ...... frOlll ..... 1 

UCSD was not chosen as a site 
for the research. No wasps will be 
released on campus. 

The trees here, however, may ' 
benefit from research conducted 
in nearby Scripps Ranch, accord-
ing to Morgan . The wasps have 
been observed to have traveled 
almost 16 miles in some areas of 
northern California, where 
research is also being conducted. 
Wasps released in neighboring 
communities may migrate here. 

"Only time will tell," Morgan 
said, describing UCSD's planned 
tactics to combat the insects. 
"We're just allowing the natural 
predators to do their job," 

Morgan said unlikely diners 
such as finches, sparrows, and 
hummingbirds are eating the 
insects. 

In another attempt not to inter-
vene, UCSD grounds keepers will 
not spray trees with insect-killing 
chen1icills, Morgan said. 

All types of eucalyptus trees on 
campus are apparently affected, 
including the sugar gum tree, the 
most numerous variety on campus. 
The insect predominantly attacks 
the red gum variety. 
Groundskeepers do not know the 
number of trees on campus nor the 
percentage that are of the red gum 
variety. . 

There are nearly 600 acres of 
landscaping on campus according 
(0 Morgan. 

One-hundred twelve of those 
acres are in Eucalyptus Grove, and 
most of the North Campus grove, 
which is north of Voigt Drive, is 
severely infected, an area of SO to 
60 acres according to Pam

Napster was originally blocked

Dismayed students searched for 
other means to download music 
from the Internet and turned to 
other sites similar to Napster. 

"I was disappointed with the 
block because my friends at other 
UCs could still use Napster, and it 
was the easiest and most widely 
used way to download mp3s," said 
sophomore Estela Blanco. 

Despite the regents' decision 
not to block Napster, the decision

tms were a/mJdy cut down urer the summer and more may be cut down at a later date. 
Jenkinson, a senior planner at 
UCSD. 

Unless the trees are entirely 
dead or are harming trees around 
them, they will not be taken out, 
Jenkinson said. 

What compounds UCSD's situ-

does not supercede blocks on 
Napster enforced by individual 
UC campuses. 

Napster is designed for users to 
download songs from the comput-
ers of other users. When a song is 
being downloaded by a user, the 
computer from which it is being 
downloaded becomes a server. 
Congestion occurs when groups of 
users are downloading from one 
server at the same time. 

At this time, there are a limited 
number of data channels on cam-
pus. There are also thousands of 
students living on campus using 
the network frequently. These 
channels can only accommodate a 
certain amount of people using the 
system at once. 

UThe system was not designed 
for that many servers: said Erik 
Strahm. ResNet coordinator at 

ation is its concentration of one 
type of tree. Morgan said it is not 
natural to have only one type of 
tree growing at such a high density 
and that such a situation multiplies 
a problem such as insect infesta-
tion . 

UCSD. "Groups making moderate 
bands on a constant basis saturate 
the data channels and slow the 
system: 

Currently there are improve-
ments being made to the system. 

The number of data channels 
on campus is being doubled to 
reduce the number of. users shar-
ing a channel, and there are even 
bids to replace the entire network. 

Most of the other UC campus-
es are already equipped with 
newer networks that allow people 
to use services such as Napster. 

Strahm said he is working hard 
to speed up the improvements of 
the system, but it is not an 
overnight projec t. 

"As soon as improvements are 
made and the network can handle 
it, the block will be removed: 
Strahm said.

Alternate Permit 
Proves Concern for 
Stude.nts' Costs 

This year UCSD's Transportation and Parking 
Services unveiled fWO versions of a $70 alternate 
schedule parking pass. Each version is valid for three 
weekdays; Monday, Wednesday, Friday, or Tuesday, 
Thursday, Friday. 

UntU recently, the alternate pass was to be valid 
. beginning Oct. 1. Consequently, students who pur-

chased the pass and planned to park on campus dur-
ing the first week of classes also needed to purchase a 
$25 occasional use pass, which allows 10 days of ·S" 
parking. Hence, students who purchased the alternate 
pass as well as an occasional use permit paid $95 -
only $19 less than the cost of the unlimited ·S" per-
mit. 

Cleo Phillips, customer service coordinator at 
Transportation and Parking Services, recently recant-
ed the decision for an Oct. 1 start date and made the 
alternate passes valid beginning Sept. 22 . This much-
needed decision corrected . a seriously problematic 
aspect of the alternate permits, and the Guardian 
believes that Phillips ' decision proves that the alter-
nate pass was truly meant to reduce student costs -
and by more than $19. 

Still, the decision to change the date of validity to 
Sept. 22 came at a date that was possibly too late to 
make a difference. Those who purchased the alternate 
pass before classes began, for instance, bought occa-
sional use passes under the impression that the $70 
pass would not be valid until October. It is unfair that 
the need for an occasional use pass has been rescind-
ed at a point that may be too late in the game for 
many students. 

While Transportation and Parking Services has 
responded to this issue by offering a refund, any stu-
dent who purchased an occasional use permit with 
the intention of parking on campus prior to Oct. 1 
will be refunded the cost of the occasional use ·S" 
permit, as long as he presents his alternative permit 
and original receipt. 

The only detraction from Transportation and 
Parking Services' impressive response to these prob-

dents of the decision. Since no student data is sub-
mitted when one purchases a parking permit, there is 
no easy way to inform those who bought occasional 
use permits of the recent changes and the opportuni-
ty for refunds. 

While the Guardian applauds Transportation

to Inform students of the recent developments in

U.S. Government Lets Down a Nation in 
a Twisted Pursuit For Justice 

The unjust imprisonment of a u.s. citizen by an overzealous government shows 
that there may not really be 'liberty and justice for all. 1 
By PARIIA BAHARIAN 
Staff Writer 

When the government set its eyes on 
former Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee 
for the alleged mishandling and transfer 
of classified materials to tapes, anything 
and everything was fair game, including 
his very fiberty. 

The government blatantly denied the 
constitutional principle of innocent until 
proven guilty and Lee was thrown into 
solitary confinement because officials 
alleged he posed a serious national secu-
rity risk. 

The fact that Lee had always cooper-
ated with his accusers. that he had shown 
no tendency for flight and that the tapes 
were in his control for six years with no 
evidence that they were compromised 
were discounted in setting his severe pre-
trial detention conditions. 

So the 60-year-old, Taiwan-born, nat-
uralized u .S. citizen was kept in chains 
whenever he was let out of his cell, which 
was only one hour per day for exercise 
and one hour per week to visit his fami-
ly. Lee was shackled at his waist, ankles 
and wrists. He was forced to endure 
these barbaric conditions for over 200 
days before his trial even commenced. 

My God, is it really that easy for the 
U.S. government to keep someone in 
solitary for nine months on evidence so 
flimsy that once the facts had to be pro-
duced, ?8 percent of the charges were 
dropped? 

The question we must ask ourselves 
is: why? Why was Lee targeted? Why 
were Lee's consti tutional rights com-
pletely trampled and ripped to shreds by 
the federal government? 

FirSt, in order to understand the com-
plex issues and contributing factors that 
led to the harassment and imprisonment 
of Lee, the entire story must be examined 
from the beginning. 

In 1998, the special Cox committee 
alleged that China had succe$sfully infi/-

trated the United States' national 
weapons laboratories and stolen top mil-
itary secrets, including classified infor-
mation on seven currently deployed 
thermonuclear warheads. 

In one broad stroke. the Cox Report 
suggested China accomplished its 
nuclear theft .by "identifying ethnic · 
Chinese in the U.S. who have access to 
sensitive information, and sometimes ... 
enlist their cooperation in iUlJal technol-
ogy or infonnation transfers. Overnight, 
all Chinese Americans became forei$ners 
again and suspicion was immediately 
focused on Asian-American scientists 
and engineers working in the labs. 

National paranoia ensued, and there 
was a mad scramble to find a scapegoat. 
It was against this backdrop of national 
hysteria that Lee was fingered by The 
New York Trmes and Nostra 1hllock, a 
largely discredited Los Alamos intelli-
gence officer, as the spy and thief for 
China in March 1999. Just like that, Lee 
became the government's scapegoat. 

Lee was arbitrarily dismissed from his 
job the next day by UC President Richard 
Atkinson on orders from Energy Secretary 
Bill Richardson. Lee was then subjected to 
sustained Gestapo-esque search and 
seizure, interrogation and intimidation, 
even threatened with execution. 
. FBI agents grilled Lee for hours, 
telling him he had failed lie detector 
tests, a claim that was revealed to be false. 
and that he would be electrocuted, like 
the Rosenbergs, if he did not cooperate 
and confess to the government about his 
supposed dealings with China. 

Lee said he could not confess for 
something he did not do. 

Lee was indicted on Dec. 10, 1999 for 
violating statutes of the· Atomic Energy 
Act of 1954. These statutes pertain to the 
mishandling of classified materials with 
the intent to injure the United States or 
to' secure an advantage for a foreign 
power. They cany a maximum sentence 
of life impnsonme(It._ 

Oddly enough, there is no record of 
any other individual ever being prosecut-
ed under these statutes. The treatment 
that Lee has been forced to endure at the 
hands of the federal government does 
not measure up to the standard seen in 
similar cases. 

A very clear-cut case of double stan-
dards in prosecution can be seen when 
comparing Lee's treatment to that of for-
mer CIA Director John Deutch, who in 
1995 and 1996 illegally placed highly 
classified material onto his insecure 
home computer. An inspector general's 
report later stated that Lee had deleted 
1,000 secret documents from his com-
puter days after he became aware of a 
government inquiry. Only in 1999 was he 
finally stripped of his security clearances. 
However, no charges were ever filed 
against him for his illegal activities. 
. In contrast, Lee was charged with 59 

counts of illegally handling top-secret 
nuclear infonnation. Why the double 
standard? This writer submits that it has 
everything to do with Lee's ethnicity. 

Prosecutors alleged that Lee down-
loaded restricted data onto tapes with the 
intent to hann the United States, but Lee 
has repeatedly said he never passed them 
to anyone. Though he was painted as the · 
spy of the century, Lee was never actual-
ly charged with espionage. 

Tht ultimate proof that hi~ charges 
were politically motivated is revealed by 
the fact that the decision to indict Lee was 
not made by the prosecutor's office in 
Albuquerque, but in th~ White House. and 
in the presence of an impressive lineup of 
powerful people in what should have been 
a routine, straightforward decision. 

The participants in that White House 
decision included the White House legal 
counsel, Attorney General Janet Reno, 
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, CIA 
Director George Tenant, FBI Director 
Louis Frech, National Security Advisor

Teaching Offers Unique Rewards 
Student's summer experience reveals the importance of enjoying one's work 

ANGELA CARRIER 
For some students, summer's 

end is a disappointment, while 
for others it is a great relief. Some 
spent the summer traveling to 
distant places. Some could not 
bear the thought of leaving cam-
pus and remained for an addi-
tional summer session. Others 
even paid homage to the infa-
mous 9-to-5 jOb. 

In any case, the majority of us 
probably spent the sunny sum-
mer days working our lives away. 

[t is very likely that the jobs 
we had were not very glamorous 
or something we intend to do for 
the rest of our lives. Retail, con-
struction, business or restaurants 
are jU5t a few of the industries to 
which we lent our time. As 
unbearable and frustrating as 
these. jobs may have been at 
times. we gained from them a 
greater appreciation of a strong 
work ethic and the ubiquitous 
dollar. • 

So here we are, back at a high-
ly ranked university working to 
earn that elusive degree; a degree 
that will land us in that occupa-
tion we desire, to work in a job 
doing what we love. 

But is that true for everyone,. 
or are the money and fame key 
issues to it all? Are you majoring 
in something because you enjoy 
it, because you can see yourself 
spending many years of your life 

doing it? 
. [quit my summer jobs two 
weeks before summer came to an 
end to spend one week with my 
grandfather in Utah before [ 
moved back to school. 

My grandfather is a vice prin-
cipal at a school in Salt Lake City 
where 60 percent of the student 
population is Mexican. He has 
been asking me for the last cou-
ple of years to come over to see 
his school and work in the class-
rooms. 

[ finally decided to take him up 
on his offer, seeing it also as a 
chance to relax after weeks and 
weeks of endless work. My days 
were not as relaxing as [ anticipat-
ed however, as I had to arrive by 7 
a.m., not to leave until after 3 p.m. 
My grandfather certainly put me 
to work helping in the bilingual 
classrooms for various ages. 

But this was a different kind 
of work. This was a rewarding 
type of work. Walking around 
the playground and having chil-
dren you have never seen before 
run up and throw their arms 
around you brings a sense of 
reward. 

To hear the Spanish-speaking 
voices [earning the language 
needed to survive and advance in 
the United States was encourag-
ing. 

The countless moments of 
nostalgia I had walking down the 
halls of this elementary school 
made me realize how far I have 
come, and how much further I 
have to go. 

The patience and dedication 
of the teachers at the school are 
unreal. I had the experience of 

substituting for a second-grade 
class and have a newfound 
appreciation for .teachers and all 
they do. The intangible awards 
for these vital guides to future 
generations are priceless. These 
teachers do it not because the 
pay is outstanding or because the 
position is full of glitz, but 
because they love it. 

I am not advocating all of us 
going out and becoming teach-
ers, though there is a great need 
for qualified people to take on 
that role. 

[ do believe, however, that the 
years invested in learning here at 
the university should be spent 
searching for what you love to 
do. 

Find what you love to do and 
what will make you happy, so 
that your satisfaction and elation 
can shine through your work 
performance and affect those 
around you. Nothing is worse 
than someone who does their 
work with a disgruntled attitude 
that reveals their obvious dis-
gust, eventually spreading over 
to you. 

I have control of my future 
right now. What I have anticipat-
ed may change, and I need to 
accept that my plans will often 
fall through, and that I must 
move on from there. 

My grandfather once told me. 
·Mi promesa es en tf: meaning 
"My promise is in you." I will 
never forget his words of sincere 
love. but also of clear expecta-
tion. His promise ·is that I suc-
ceed in whatever [ do, and there 
is no greater success than spend-
ing your life doing work you love.

JSurvivor' Obsession Reflects 
America's Love For Voyuerism 
The show strikes a chord in millions of viewers 
By KIM HOOPER 
Staff Writer 

We are a society of voyeurs, the 
television set being our instrument 
of choice. We are always peering 
into the lives of others, taking on 
the roles of private investigators or 
gossip columnists instead of mind-
ing our own business. 

Somehow, people gain a greater 
understanding of themselves and 
their world by watching others, by 
seeing how they react to and deal 
with situations. 

Television networks are increas-
ingly capitalizing on the spectacle 
of voyeurism, knowing the public 
is thirsty for the guilty pleasure of 
being on the outside, looking in on 
the lives of others. All the hype 
about voyeurism has come to a 
boiling point following the 
"Survivor" phenomenon. 

This summer, ·Survivor" could 
not be avoided. The sky-high rat-
ings for the CBS show reinforced 
the notion that the voyeurism phe-
nomenon has peaked. 

At first, the premise sounded far-
fetched: Put everyday Joes on an 
island, and the last one left gets $1 
million. Despite some doubts, CBS 
executives were on to 
something. They had placed their 
fingers right on the pulse of America 
and they knew that this show, with 
its unique opportunity to see 
humans in a raw environment, 
would find success. 

It certainly did. 
Initially, I· was just an observer 

of the voyeurs. In restaurants, llis-
tened to the conversations around 
the tables. I overheard conversa-
tions about who got kicked off, 

celebrations for the "jerks" who 
were gone, eulogies in memory of 
favorites who supposedly deserved 
to remain. 

At family gatherings, everyone 
from my little sister to my grand-
mother had predictions about who 
would be the winner. 

I attended "Survivor" parties, 
watched people race home every 
Wednesday at 8 p.m., saw the maga· 
zinc covers that made the castaways 
look like celebrities. I was perplexed 
by it all and curiously disturbed by 
how much pleasure people were 
experiencing while watching some-
thing so blatantly voyeuristic. 

I just had to watch the last few 
episodes. When I tuned in, the 
phenomenon became clearer to 
me. There were the usual elements 
of exploitive television program-
ming; the suspenseful 'violence" of 
the infamous alliance, the alleged 
sex between Colleen and Greg. 

However, beyond these typical 
factors used to gather audiences was 
something deeper: a study of how 
human beings function and relate 
when removed from the hustle and 
bustle of modern life. The contes-
tants were stripped of their social 
relationships, their jobs and every 
other distraction of the "real world" 
that manages to mask our true 
selves. They were left bare - literal-
ly, in Richard Hatch's case - mak-
ing for a television version of 
William Golding's "Lord of the 
Flies." 

With the season over, Hatch is 
$1 million richer, previous no-
names are cash ing in on their 15 
minutes of fame, and we voyeurs

Sandy Berger, and las~ U.S. 
Attorney of Albuquerque John 
Kelly, who was in charge of the case 
in New Mexico. 

Why was there such an impres-
sive lineup of top Washington 
power players in on a decision that 
would normally be made by the 
U.S. Attorney of Albuquerque? 

According to Ling-Chi Wang, 
chair of UC Berkeley's ethnic stud-
ies program, "It was a high- level 
political decision to use the judicial 
process to lock up a Chinaman.

process, stonewilll any Asian -

ated with the Cox Report until the 
November presidential election is 
over: 

So Lee was railroaded and put in 
jail for the sole reason that it was 
more favorable politically to put an 
end the controversy of stolen 
nuclear secrets as quickly as possi-
ble. The fact that Lee is a U.S. citizen 
with constitutional rights did not 
stop the government from acting. 

The horrific saga came to an 
enQ on Sept. 13 when Lee pleaded 
guilty to one felony charge of ille-
gally retaining national defense 
information . He was sentenced to 
the 278 days he had already served 
since his arrest . All 58 other 
counts, many of which carried life 
sentences, were dropped. 

While Lee has a lot of explaining 
to do about those missing tapes, the 
government's conduct toward him 
conjures images of what the 
Gestapo did to the Jews and the 
U.S. government did to Japanese 
Americans during World War II. 

The judge who presided over 
the case, James Parker, rebuked 
Washington for its abuse of power 
and apologized to Lee for the role

~~m~.onWbe~mA_~ 
Euro as Its Currency 

COPENHAGEN, Denmark -
Pursuing an odd calling as the 
barometer of Europe's mood, 
holds its fourth referendum in less 
than a decade on Thursday on 
what degree of integration with 
the European Union the country 
desires. 

This time, the question being 
put to just over four million voters 
IS whether Denmark should fol-
low 12 other countries of the 15-
member Union and join a shared 
European currency, the euro. But 
the real issue in the vote may be 
summed up otherwise: It's the 
. politics, stupid . 

The Danish currency, the 
krope,_is pegged to the euro and 
has followed the currency's 25 
percent slide against the dollar 
over the last 21 months. This link 
will be maintained whatever the 
outcome of the vote. 

But even if this arrangement 
ties Denmark irrevocably to 
Europe'S economic fate, many 
Danes are concerned about 
adopting a currency they see as a 

political symbol of a push for a 
European superstate in which the 
identity of small nations like 
Denmark would be diminished. 

"Countries should have 
their own borders, their 
own defense and their 
own currency .. . " 

-, ... ...., 
DanIsh People's Party 

"Countries should have their 
own borders. their own defense 
and their own currency, but all of 
this is being eroded by attempts to 
create a United States of Europe: 
said Peter Skaarup, a member of 
the right-wing Danish People's 
Party. "If we give up the krone. we 
won't be masters in our own 
house any more." 

Such fears have bolstered the 
"No" campaign, and most opin-
ion polls suggest tbat Danes will 
reject the euro. The vote, however, 

is too close to call, with at least 10 
percent of the electorate undecid-
ed, and the government of Socia 
Democratic Prime Minister Poul 
Nyrup Rasmussen is placing its 

• faith in a last-minute swing in 
favor of the euro. 

Other European govern-
ments will be watching closely. 
The weakness of the euro since 
its introduction in 1999 has been 
tied partly to a market perception 
that the will does not exist in the 
European Union to pursue the 
sort of political integration that 
would bolster the currency. 

A Danish rejection of the euro 
would inevitably reinforce such 
sentiments at a time when the 
European Central Bank, with sup-
port from the United States and 
japan, has already felt obliged to 
intervene in support of the cur-
rency. Any prospect of Britain and 
Sweden adopting the euro would 
a Iso recede.

Book Attacks Anthropologists Who 
Studied Brazilian Indians 

A book about anthropolo-
gists working -with isolated 
Indians in Amazonia has 
touched off a raging storm in the 
profession, reviving scholarly 
animosities, endangering per-
sonal reputations and, some of 
the parties say, threatening to 
undermine confidence in legiti-
mate practices of anthropology. 

In the book, "Darkness in EI 
'borado: How Scientists and 
Journalists Devastated the 
Amazon: Patrick Tierney, a 
journalist, presents evidence 
showing that in 1968 anthropol-
ogists, supported by the former 
Atomic Energy Commission, 
inoculated several -communities 
of the Yanomami Indians with a 
measles vaccine. 

He suggests that this experi-
ment possibly contributed to the 
epidemic of the disease that 
broke out. 

"Hundreds, perhaps thou-
sands" of people died in a popu-
lation of little more than 20,000, 
the author reported.

Tierney as examples of careless 
and perhaps unethical behavior

ers who visited and studied the

Some anthropologists who 
have read the book or a summa-
ry 'of the allegations joined the 
attack, urging the American 
Anthropological Association or 
some other scientific body to 
undertake a thorough investiga-

tion of the "imminent scandal." 
They expressed concern that 

the allegations would make it 
more difficult to gain permission 
to conduct field work in many 
countries and win the trust of 
subjects of their studies. 

Others who are familiar with 
some of the book's contents 
insisted that the allegations were 
either unfounded or exaggerat-
ed .

of WenHoLee.org an online organi-

said Wednesday that Reno and 
Freeh, in their testimony on 
Thesday, had failed to justify their 
actions in the case and presented 
"tattered reasons to justify this polit-
ically motivated witch hunt." 

The lawmakers.were highly crit-
ical Wednesday of the government's 
determination to keep Lee In jail as 
he awaited trial. He was confined in 
a county jail in Albuquerque under 
solitary conditions like those 
imposed on maximum security pris-
oners. At times, Lee was manacled 
with wrist, waist and ankle chains, 
and a light was always on in his cell.

nations would gain no tax revenue 
from services flowing in from the 
outside. But this bill, which has 
stirred controversy not only on 
the continent but among high-
technology companies in the 
United States, would require 
companies outside Europe with 
sales here of such services exceed-
ing 100,000 euros, or about 
$88,000, to register in one 
European country for the purpose 
of paying value-added taxes. 

The stakes are significant. In 
1999, European e-commerce 
sales were $3.4 billion, or less 
than one~half of 1 percent of total 
sales. But by some estimates, such 
sales in Europe may rise as high 
as 12 percent of the total in the 
next few years. 

But serious 'obstacles face the 
proposed European legislation, 
and enactment is far from certain. 
For one thing, the bill will not 
become effective unless it is 
approved and enacted into 
national law by all 15 members of 
the European Union . It also needs 
to pass in the European 

. Parliament.

Major Parties are Emerging as Big Spenders in TV Advertising 
The Republican and 

Democratic party organizations are 
by a wide margin outspending both 
special interest groups and the 
Bush and Gore campaigns on tele-
vision in the presidential election. 

Political analysts say this trend 
is transfonnin~ the parties this year 
from supportmg players into full 
partners in the advertising efforts. 

The basic strategic shift, say 
researchers who monitor television 
spending in the presidential race, is 
a departure from previous election 
cycles, when the candidates them-
selves ran the majority of commer-
cials and spent far more money 
than the parties. And it means that 

this year, if the trend continues, the 
advertising campaigns will have 
been financed to a much larger 
degree by the unregulated soft 
mon.ey donated to the parties by 
corporations and wealthy individu-
als. 

The latest indication that the 
national parties are the major 
advenisers for Gore and Bush this 
year came in a study on television 
spending on Wednesday by the 
Brennan Center for Justice at New 
York University School of Law. 

The report showed that 
between June 1 and Sept. 20, the 
two parties had spent more than 
$52 million on commercials, while 

Political anarysts say this 
trend is transforming the 
parties this year from 
supporting parties into 
full partners in the 
advertising efforts, 
the Bush and Gore campaigns had 
spent less than half that - about 
$21 million. 

The study, produced jointly 
with Ken Goldstein, a political sci-
ence professor at the University of 
Wisconsin, found that the trend 

was continuing to hold up this 
month, traditionally the time when 
the candidates, flush with the pro-
ceeds from the federal funds allot-
ted them after the conventions, 
have taken over much of the 
responsibility for running com-
mercials. 

Four years ago, for example, Bob 
Dole's campaign ran 6,100 spots 
and President Clinton's 3,~00 spots 
the first full week after Labor Day, 
the Brennan Center found. That 
same week, the Republican Party 
ran just 147 commercials and the 
Democratic Party a mere one. 

This year, however, the parties 
have shown no sign of letting up 

after Labor Day. Brennan Center 
researchers found that in the seven 
days that ended Sept. 20, the two 
parties were still the biggest 
spenders : The Republican Party 
spent nearly $2.3 million on televi-
sion during the week. or $300,000 
more than the Bush campaign . 
The Democratic Party, meanwhile, 
spent $1.8 million , or about 
$800,000 more than the Gore 
campaign . Special interest groups 
spent a total of about ~1.1 million 
on both candidates across the 
country.

Collegiate: 
Harvard feels that the 
government expects too 
much supervision 
c-tlnuecl ".. .... 1 

with the university, including a . 
current professor, are also named 
as defendants. 

The now-defunct Harvard 
Institute for International 
Development administered the 
program. 

The suit claims the university 
failed to provide adequate supervi-
sion for the program, allowing the 
other defendants to profit illegally 
by investing in the Russian econo-
my. 

The U.S. Attorney's Office 
maintains that Harvard's contract 
required it to closely supervise its 
agents but does not claim that 
Harvard profited in any way. 

"The United States bargained 
for a level of administration and 
supervision," Stern said. "Harvard 
had obligations, as grantee does, 
and it failed to [follow through] ." 

But Harvard said the govern-
ment is expecting unreasonable 
levels of supervision, noting that 
even the U.S Attorney's office said 
the other defendants made signif-
icant efforts to conceal thei r 
actions. 
. "Harvard and the government 

have very different understandings 
of the law and of equity," said Vice 
President and General Counsel 
Anne Taylor. "[The government] 
says whether you know [about iIIe-

gal activities) or not, you're respon-
sible. I disagree.· 

The suit alleges that, at times, 
Harvard aid program administra-
tors knew of questionable actions 
but ignored them. 

"HlIrvard administrators were 
aware of abuses and allowed them 
to continue,- the suit reads. 

However, Harvard denies these 
claims. • 

"I can assure you that any indi-

"Harvard and the 
government have very 
different understandings 
of the law and of equity. "

viduals in a position who could do 
something about [the allegations] 
were not aware of them," said Joe 
Wrinn, the university spokesper-
son. 

Both Wrinn and Taylor noted 
that the government had previous-
ly praised the advice given by 
Harvard's Russian aid project, 
making it hard to understand the. 
government's decision to sue -
especially for such a large sum of 
money. 

But Stern said the value of any 
advice given was i rrel~va nt, empha-
sizing that overall results do not 
absolve Harvard from its supervi-
sory responsibility. 

In addition to the university, the 
suit names professor of economics 

Thursday, Septe~ber 28, 2000 

Andrei Shleifer '82, his wife Nancy 
Zimmerman, former Harvard 
employee Jonathan Hay and his 
wife Elizabeth Hebert as defen-
dants. Shleifer was principal inves-
tigator and project director of the 
aid program and Hay was the gen-
eral director. 

The suit claims that while pro-
viding economic and legal advice 
for the development of Russian 
capital r:narkets, the individual 
defendants violated conflict-of-
interest rules prohibiting them 
from investing in the Russian 
economy. The suit claims they even 
diverted U.S. government resources 
for thei r own use. 

The complaint alleges that 
Shleifer and Zimmerman invested 
$200,000 in various Russian com-
panies and Russian government 
debt. In addition, the couple and 
Hay allegedly purchased "several 
hundred thousand dollars worth" 
of shares in Russia!) oil companies 
in the name of Shleifer's father-in-
law. 

The complaint also includes 
claims that all four individuals 
used their position to gain official 
approval to launch mutual fu nds 
in Russia. Hay and Zimmerman 
are also accused of using U.S. 
govern men t-funded staff and 
offices for purposes like perform-
ing research for their private oil 
investments. 

Lawyers for the individual 
defendants said the government's 
suit is misguided. 

"There is no substance to what 
was alleged," said Hebert's attorney 
Lloyd Macdonald.

Lea: 
Race playS key role in 
mistreatment 

~ ............. 
he played in his suffering: 
"Although I have no authority to 
speak on behalf of the executive 
branch, I sincerely apologize to 
you, Lee, for the/unfair manner you 
were held in custody by the execu-
tive branch." 

Judge Parker went on to ques-
tion the motives of the federal gov-
ernment in detaining Lee. 

"What was the government's 
motive in insisting on your being 
jailed pretrial under extraordinary 
onerous conditions of confinement 
until today, when the executive 
branch agrees that you may be set 
free essentially unrestricted? This 
makes no sense to me." 

Judge Parker is right. What hap-
pened to the dangerous security 
risk Lee supposedly posed? Did it 
even exist in the first place? It 
makes no sense as to why Lee was 
targeted so harshly, if not for the 
color of his skin and country of 
origin. 

Unequal protection under the 
~w js very clear in this case. Had Lee 
not been an Asian American, he 
most likely would have never been 
~ed, just as Deutch never was. 
Whire Deutch got a slap on the 
wrist, Lee was detained for over 200 
days. 

So what should we as students 
do when we are faced with blatant 
racism? 

As Roger Hu, a graduate stu-
dent at MIT said, "Stay alen, join . 
the support group, and most of all, 
raise some hell about this issue:" 

If we do not speak out ~hen 
racism attacks innocent people and 
lives are completely ruined, we are 
no better than conspirators helping 
it happen. 

Though the president and 
attorney general refuse to apologize 
for their conduct, we can do some-
thing to force their hands and help 
right the terrible wrong committed 
against Lee. Write a letter today to 
President Clinton demanding a full 
pardon for Lee. After all, that is the 
least he can do to make up for this 
injustice.

Show is a lesson in

ContII •• d .......... 

not need to be politically correct or 
likable, as long as you are part of an 
alliance. Rudy, the type who makes 
inappropriate one-liners, got to the 
final three despite a candid dislike 
of many of the contestants and 
constant criticisms of homosexual-
ity (note that Rudy's need for an 
alliance with Hatch, who is gay, 
outweighed his disapproval of 
Hatch's lifestyle, which re-empha-
sizes the previous lesson). 

Lesson number five: 1h1st no 
one. Badstabbing runs rampant 
when humans chase after a prize, 
whether that prize be $1 million or a 
position at the top of the corporate 
ladder. The backstabbing may be 
blatant, as exhibited by Sue's harsh 
diatribe directed at Kelly, or it may be 
sly and conniving, as shown by 
Hatch, who manipulated people to 
suit his needs. Hatch won because 
he was deceptively cunning and not 
at all ashamed of letting any rela-
tionships fall by the wayside on the 
way to achieving his goals. The con-
clusion: Niceness is overrated. 

Of course, there are no direct cor-
relationS between "Survivor- and the 
world in which we live. For example, 
the people on the island had Cam~ 
in their faces 24 hours a day, which 
created more pressure and ai, effect 
that was anything but realistic. 

However, as with any voyeuris-
tic venture, we now have greater 
insight into our kind. Whether that 
is enlightening, unnerving or both

ons of people milling 
about, amid a wealth 
of smells, sights, 
tastes, sounds and 
amazing performers: T This is what to expect 

for the 19th annual Adams 
Avenue Street Fair this Saturday 
and Sunday. 

Aside from the staples of all 
street fair celebrations - food, 
drink, people and pavement -
there will be multiple stages at 
the Adams Avenue fair, featur-
ing over 30 local musicians, 
troupes, entertainers and edu-
cators of many kinds all per-
forming for free, all day long. 

However. if you absolutely 
have to choose one time to be at 
the fair, try Saturday at 2:3.0 
p.m. and 4:30 p.m. at the 
Dimilles Stage. This is where 
the Taco Shop Poets will be 
doing their thing - bringing 
everyone out on the street a lit-
tle closer. 

Using spoken word, instru-
ments, high hopes, harsh reali-
ties and spice. the Taco Shop 
Poets cook up some food for 

I 

thought. They have been speak-
ing and playing, rapping and 
singing their truth since 1994 
and though their numbers and 
members have shifted through-
out the years. the group is still 
~oing ., strong with the same 
mtenstty as always. 

This will be only their sec-
ond time at the Adams Avenue 
Street Fair, but they are no 
strangers to performing at com-
munity gatherings. 

Based in San Diego and 
Tijuana, the group got its name 
from its main venue, the taco 
shop. This cultural center • 
which the Taco Shop Poets use 
as their main stage, is Chicano 
in origin yet is also frequented 
by all ethnicities in our border 
area. They are not quaint or lit-
erary like coffee shops or stuffy 
and expensive like theaters - in 
taco shops people come to eat 
and hang out and, if they are 
lucky. sometimes hear poetry.

Guardian Review: ~~~[illrnJi]~ 
Take some Morphine with your Pokemon and start 'Rising for Sunset' 

Gene 
Rising For Sunset 

Contra 

A 
The problem with many live 

albums is that during the master-
ing process, they lose quality of 
sound and the very nuances that 
should make a live album what it 
is. 

A live album is supposed to take 
you back to the show and make 
you ' feel like you are standing front 
and center, moving and singing 
along with the crowd. It is sup-
posed to make you wish that you 
spent your money on a ticket 
instead of on a CD. 

With their recent live album, 
"Rising For Sunset: Gene make 
you wish you had bought that tick-
et. The album places you right in 
the front row. 

After a three-year hiatus, Brit 
rockers Gene returned to U.S. soil 
to playa trio of sold-out shows at 
the Troubadour in West Hollywood 

in early June. The technology-savvy 
lads from Camden webcasted and 
recorded their shows for the live 
album. 

"Rising for Sunset" was 
released early this summer and 
captured the very essence of 
Gene's electrifying shows in early 
June. 

"Rising For Sunset" beautifully 
reflects the charismatic elegance 
and arrogance of frontman Martin 
Rossiter,'along with that silky growl 
in his voice. Through the music 
you can almost imagine Rossiter 
strutting around on stage as he 
sings with intense conviction 
behind Steve Mason's gorgeous 
guitar. 

The listener is transported to 
the floor of the concert with rous-
ing renditions of "Olympian" and 
"You'll Never Walk Again," in 
which you can hear the yelps of a 
crowd that has thirsted for this 
show for years. 

The live album pays careful 
attention to detail by including the 
band's introduction in the midst of 
crowd noise. You can feel Rossiter's 
inescapable presence throughout 
the entire CD. 

Not wanting to deprive the lis-
tener of the concert experience, 
"Rising for Sunset" includes 20 
seconds of solid adulation as Gene 
graciously includes an encore, 
"Somewhere in the World: 

For those who were there, the 
album takes them back to those 
magical nights. For the unfortunate 
souls who were unable to attend, 
"Rising for Sunset" carefully leads 
you by the hand right through the 
doors of the Troubadour and into 

the comforting arms of Gene.

• Make sure you're alone, and 
get ready to turn off the stereo 
really quickly if you think you hear 
your roommates coming through 

.the front door. Otherwise, you're 
OK. • 

Carefully turn up the volume, 
notch by notch, and fill your ears 
with the sweet music from and 
inspired by "Pokemon The Movie 
2000: The Power of One: 

Be prepared to be assaulted 
with frighteningly catchy pop 
hooks, soaring candy-coated 
vocals, and hypnotic dance beats 
and power chords lifted straight 
from the: '80s. 

If you tum up the volume with 
caution and listen a bit closer, you 

will discover the angst and frustra-
tion experienced by Pokemon 
trainers all over the world. Their 
parents just don't understand 
Pokemon. Parents have no concept 
of the hard work that is involved 
with training Pokemon and making 
sure you have a diversified 
Pokedex. (It's kind of like the stock 
market, Mom and Dad) . 

Songs like "They Don't Under-
stand" by Dream Street express the 
pain and the struggle of Pokemon 
trainers who have to deal with un-
hip parents. "With All Your Heart" by 
plus ONE and "The Extra Mile" by 
Laura Pausini push Pokemon train-
ers to reach for their limits, making 
sure they become the very best. 

With these moving songs 
about carrying on through times 
of darkness, you can't help but 
turn up the volume and feel the 
soaring vocals and the sweeping 
strings. 

UK supergroup Westlife makes 
an appearance on the soundtrack, 
wooing the young ladies with 
their sentimental crooning. Their 
powerful chorus in the refrain 
explains it all: "I'm flying without 
wings." 

You will become a bit more bold 
as you begin to dance to the funky 
breakbeats and pumping bass drum 
of "Pokemon World" by 
Youngstown featuring Nobody's 
Angel. A cross between the pop suc-
cess "Blue" by Eiffel 65 and "I 
Believe" by Cher, this song is sure to 
be a single that will bum up the 
charts.

A-
Mark Sandman, lead singer and 

bass guitarist of Morphine, died 
last summer of a fatal heart attack 
while performing at a concert in 
Italy. The group was best known 
for Sandman's weathered voice and 
its patented two-string slide bass 
(where both strings were tuned to 
the same note). 

"Bootleg: Detroit" is a posthu-
mous release of the band's 1994 
show in Detroit. Interestingly, it was 
a fan that taped the performance at

munity can afford to see us in arts venues," 
explains Michael Figgins, group member. 
"We want to empower people through the 
arts, and taco shops are comfortable and 
personal." 

Taco shops serve traditional chorizo, the 
world famous burrito, the Mexican rice 

safe - street fair would compare to their 
other performances. . 

"The most important thing is that the 
venue is community oriented. The Adams 
Avenue Street Fair brings a lot of people 
together and it's free to the public" 

The Taco Shop Poets are Adriane Aran-
cibia, Tomas Riley, Adolfo Guzman Lopez, 
Figgins, Skip Howitt, Benny Heron 
("Eklipse") and Miguel Angel Soria. They . 
have a CD, "Chorizo Tonguetire," and an 
anthology by the same name. They speak in 
Spanish and English and play jazz, Latin jazz 
and hip hop. They groove and turn their 

experience into art. drink horchata and Coke. 
Taco shops are borderlands 
within themselves. They 
lend well to the knowledge 
of the Taco Shop Poets, 
who cater to the thirst of 
our particular culture. How 
strange it is to live in a land 
where taco shops are one of 
the closest things we have 
in common with a neigh-
boring country. 

In addition to taco 
shops. the Taco Shop Poets 
do also perform at universi-
ties and Qther more tradi-
tional venues. Sometimes, 
they make appearances at 
even less traditional venues. 

"The most 
important thing is 
that the venue is 
community oriented, 
The Adams Avenue 
Street Fair brings a 
lot of people together 
and it's free to the 
public."

where the Taco Shops

Enjoy Goya Again 
Movie celebrates the father of 
modern painting 
., LINDSAY SWOIIIIO 
Hiatus Editor 

Sometimes you just want to go 
see a movie where you don't have 
to think. If this is your inclination, 
then avoid "Goya in Bordeaux: 
which is opening at the Landmark 
Hillcrest Cinema on Friday. 

It is quite a brainful: creative 
cinematography and lighting, com-
plicated scriptwriting, bits and 

approach the art of filmmaking as 
Goya would have executed a paint-
ing. 

Saura explained that "Space. 
and above all the light which 
makes up the space, are essential. 
The whole thing has been con-
ceived as two large blocks: the 
acting and the lighting. The light 
is inseparable' from our concep-
tion of the set: 

This gives the movie an inter-
pieces of sociopo-
litical history, and 
subtitles. In short, 
it's not your typical 
"popcorn and 
Coke" movie. 

Directed by 

"It is a story with a 
plot as the director 
says, but it5 not 
realism. I don't like 
working on realistic 
projects, because I 
don't believe that 
memory' is ever the 
same as reality. " 

esting spin. Period 
pieces are usually 
s.cripted with the 
stringency of the 
social order in 
mind (Le. the film-
making is as quaint 
and conservative as 
the tradition of tea 
time) . 

Instead, "Goya 
In Bordeaux· puts 
everything in a 
dreamlike state. It 
is true to the time 
period and avan t 

Carlos Saura, this 
movie focuses on 
the fiery li fe of 
master Spanish 
painter Francisco 
de Goya . It also 
expects you to 
know a little bit 
about the man . 
Many scenes in the 
movie artfully 
replicate some of 
his most famous 

_ Pedro MonRo garde at the same 
costume designer time. The light and 

shadows are used 

works in subtle ways that only the 
informed can appreciate. This 
movie was created by an avid fan 
for the avid fan . 

Goya's romantic exploits, his 
aristocratic affiliatio!1 ~' his politi-
cal sentiments, his relationship 
with his children, with his art, 
with 'his past - all of this is 
depicted in fleeting and incongru-
ous jumps and spurts throughout 
the film . 

The result is a somewhat con-
fusing montage of surrealistic seg-
ments, though this may be what 
the director intended. With this 
film, Saura attempts not only to tell 
the story of Goya's life, but to 

to express the fog-
giness of memory and the drama of 
a canvas. 

Costume designer Pedro 
Moreno explained that "It is a 
story with a plot, as the director 
says, but it's not realism. I don 't 
like working on realistic projects. 
because I don't believe that mem -
ory is ever the saml; as reality. We 
wanted to avoid betraying the 
spirit of Goya, but neither did we 
want to have cliched 'Goya-esque' 
images.· 

This has a lot to do with the 
genius that was Goya . Born in 
1746. Goya witnessed the imperial

Goya:

decline of Spain, four controversial 
monarchies, an occupied govern-
ment under Jose Bonapart, and a 
gruesome war of independence 
between Spain and France. All of it 
had a tremendous effect on his art-
work, as did the experience of 
becoming deaf in his 405. 

It is from France, the country of . 
Goya's death and political exile, 

that he narrates the story of his life, 
and the scraps of his memory cine-
matically unfold. 

Goya painted in the tradition of 
portraitists before him and expand-
ed the art, using his emotions and 
political passions in previously 
uncharted areas. For this reason he 
is considered the first modern 
painter. 

"There are some people who 
live at the center of the hurricane 
and who seek to express the con-
vulsions of a world in transforma-
tion: Saura said. "Goya was a wit-
ness to and part of a coun try where 
intolerance, disease and war were a 
part of everyday life. 

"I don 't believe we have a more 
reliable testimony to the violence of 
war than his engravings: Saura , 
continued. "There is neither senti-
mentality nor tenderness in them 
- simply a powerful vision which 
tries to express the horrors which 
he experienced and imagined. He 
saw and experienced it in his pow-
erfully imaginative mind: 

Saura's love for Goya is obvious, 
and anyone with a similar passion 
will have no problem enjoying the 
movie. It is worth seeing just for 
the beautifully surreal images and 
creative structure, but is even more 
enjoyable with a bit of prior knowl-
edge of the artist.

the city's popular St. Andrew's Hall, 
capturing a glimmer of what this 
group could have contributed to the 
ever-changing face of rock 'n' roll. 

The crowd interaction is as allur-
ing as the dark sensuality resonating 
from Sandman's voice, exposing 
the raw emotion that these early 
performances generated. The hall 
roars with approval as Sandman 
emotes in a sultry slur between 
songs. "Well, we SlOpped by to visit 
Mary, and during the next few 
songs. we're going to visit Sheila, 
we'll visit Claire. And then I think 
we should stop in at the Motel of 
Shame and step into their heated 
pool in the back." The intimate con-
nection 'Sandman makes with the 
crowd is somewhat reminiscent of 
Jim Morrison and the Doors during 
their early years at the Whiskey. 

Like many other bands, Mor-
phine 's greatest strength arose 
from the live energy of their con-
cens, transforming the dark matter 

. of their music into a soulful explo-
ration of life. "Bootleg" accom-
plishes what their studio albums 
could never grasp : the rich connec-

- tion made between the musician, 
the music and the fan . 

- by David Lee 

Photek 
Solaris 

Astralwerks 
B 

Photek, a.k.a. Rupert Parkes, 
delves into garage house and 
dbwntempo trip hop this time 
around and creates a unique elec-
tronic harmony by incorporating 
layers of simple bass lines and 
ambient melodies. ·Solaris" does 
resonate echoes from the past with 
Photek's unique mini malism, 
offering exquisite vocals blended 
with simple yet foot-tapping 
breaks. 

However, this second project 
tru ly stands on its own as a differ-
ent dimension into Photek's oth-
erwise ·simple" universe. Unpre-. 
dictable drum 'n' bass loops 
weave in and out of taut drum kits 
and natural samples of running 
water. 

The most attractive element lO 
this album is Photek's personal 
style, which incorporates different 
electronic motifs into one cohe-
sive groove. Unfortunately, many 
of the tracks loop into broken 
rhythms that could only be 
appreciated by experimental 
enthusiasts. 

The breakdown: a great buy for 
those tired of traditional electronic 
styles and in search of something 
more eclectic.

looked like a professional team; 
said Derek Armstrong, head coach 
for the men's soccer team. "Even 
though we played well in the sec-
ond half, they dominated at the 
outset and during the crucial 
moments of the match." 

This match improved CSU 
Dominguez Hills' record to 8-1-0. 
The loss was only the second suf-
fered by UCSD, whose record was 
5-2-0. 

However, the Tritons rebound-
ed from their two-game losing 
streak and defeated CSU Los 
Angeles, 3-2. 

Junior Bobby Saadati WJlS the 
star for UCSD, scoring a goal and 
assisting on one to help the Tritons 
to a 6-2-0 record. Ryan Weirich 
had 8 saves to aid the UCSD cause. 

"This was a different class of an 
opponent," Armstrong said. "We 
didn't want to get in the habit of 
suffering consecutive losses, so we 
are glad to get back on the winning 
side and now look forward to play-
ing well on the road."

for rec clubs to move to the level of

Athletic Association; these matches 
will impact the playoff chance for 
the Tritons. 

"We want to come back from 
this short 'road still in Ithe playoff 
chasel," Armstrong said. "We have 
a young team and if we can make 
the playoffs or stay near the rest of 
the field, this will give our players a 
lot of confidence for the remainder 
of the season and in the years to 
come." 

Armstrong also mentioned that 
the beginning of the season has 
been reasonably kind to the men's 
soccer team, and he is seeing a lot 
from his younger players. He is 
anxious to see how they will 
respond in the weeks to come. 

"We are 'going to find out where 
we are in these next couple games. 
This is the barometer that our sea-
son will fall under." 

When playoff time comes 
around, the t~p three teams in the 
division get an automatic playoff 
berth, while one team is selected as 
a wildcard team due to having the 
best record among the remaining 
teams in the CCAA 

With teams such as Cal State 
University Bakersfield and Grand 
Canyon University coming up, it 
seems that the best way for the 
men's soccer team to make it to 
the playoffs is by getting one of 
the three automatic playoff posi-
tions. This is the task set forth by 
Armstrong and his assistant 
coaches. 

doing all the right things, then they 
can become a team." 

However, the street runs both 
ways, and teams that became club 
teams can be booted down to the 
rec level if their program lags and 
participation drops off. Club 
sports can also become NCAA 
intercollegiate sports if there is 
enough support, and the sport in 
question is a sanctioned NCAA 
sport.

Club sfX!11S strive despite

ee.u..d rr... ... 24 
Rugby players have to buy all their 
own equipment, and the snow-
board and ski team has to come 
up with the cash to go to the 
mountains every other weekend 
during the season. 

lYler Zarubin is a member of 
the snowboard and ski team and 
says the cost to the athletes in 
club sports is exorbitant. 

"The dues this year were $350, 
and that only included the house 
that we wiU stay at for the compe-
titions, • Zarubin said. 

However, this does not mean 
that Zarubin does not enjoy 
being on the team; in fact, he 
loves it. 

"People are intimidated to join 
the team,W Zarubin said. "Don't 
be; the team is for people who 
love to ski and snowboard. The 
team is oriented towards enjoy-
ment; it is really a great way to get 
up in the mountains and just ' 
enjoy yourself." 

The team competes through-
out the winter and early spring. 
and is in a league with eight other 
Southern California teams, 
including UCLA UCSB and Cal 
Poly San Luis Obispo. 

It is easy to think of club sports 
as something easygoing. with less 
of an edge than intercollegiate 
competition. However, club sports 
are intercollegiate - the only dif-
ference between rugby and base-
ball is that baseball is recognized 
by the NCAA as a sanctioned 
sport. ' 

However. club sports do have 
. their own governing body, the 

National Intramural and 
Recreation Sports Association. 
Four hundred universities belong 
to NIRSA. which helps to orga-

nize and preside over the compe-
titions and relations between the 
different programs. 

"Club sports offers students 
the chance to be competitive at 
the sport that they love: Berndes 
said. "Coming out of high 
school, maybe you were a big 
star in baseball. tennis or volley-
ball and here you don't have the 
time to put into NCAA Division 
II, or maybe you're not good 
enough. Club sports give people 
a chance to play a sport like 

"Club sports offers

play a sport like rugby,

Club sports director 

rugby, or to sailor be on the surf 
team." 

Beyond this, club sports give 
students a chance to play sports 
that are huge in other parts of the 
country, but are not funded at the 
NCAA level at UCSD because of 
money restrictions or unpopulari-
ty. Lacrosse is such a sport. which 
is as popular back East as football 
is out West. 

Much of the recruitment 
proces$ for club sports is done by 
word of mouth. The teams recruit 
on campus and work hard to 
spread the word. 

Recruiting can also be done 
through the mail. As an incoming 
freshman, Harley Wallace. water 
ski team captain, received a club 
sports pamphlet in the mail. 

"I just sent the pamphlet back 

The UCSD Guardian 

with 'water skiing' checked off, 
and I was contacted by the cap-
tain: Wallace said. "I have been 
on the team for the last four 
years.w 

Pete Knudsen, one of the 
standout cyclists for UCSD. has, 
like Harley, been involved in the 
club sports program during all his 
yearS at UCSD. Now a junior, he 
is helping to organize the UCSD 
mountain bike race, which is 
going to be held at the canyon in 
the eucalyptus grove below 
RlMAC on Nov. 18. 

"Cycling is great," Knudsen 
said. "You meet some interesting 
guys, and even though we are 
cyclists we throw some pretty 
good parties. You have not seen 
anything until you see roller 
beers. The race is going to be real-
ly great also; you should come 
check it out." 

Most of the club sports are 
semitraditional and have an estab-
lished following. For those inter-
ested in trying something a little 
more off the beaten track and not 
in for the competitive nature of 
dub sports, there are recreational 
dub sports. 

The rec clubs, which are also 
presided over by Berndes, 
include campus organizations 
like the surf club, known for 
throwing big ragers in La Jolla, 
and the annual beer fest with 

"Frenchie~ down at Black's 
Beach. 

Other rec clubs include the 
juggling. triathlon and cheerlead-
ing clubs. 

Rec clubs cannot present 
themselves by the moniker of 
UCSD "team.W They are student 
organizations and must be 
known, for example, as "the jug-
gling club of UCSD." Rec clubs 
are not funded by the university to 
the same extent as club sports, but

The Thtons went on a rampage

T here is a place where beer is always cold, dark and plen-tiful, the music is always 
loud, and the barbecue is always 
chock-full of the most succulent 
meats. It is a true oasis of debauch-
ery; the last bastion of fun for those 
looking to escape all of those die-
hard try-hards who plague our 
campus like book-wielding mold 
on the perfectly nice piece of 
honey-roasted ham that is La Jolla. 

This hallowed haven is known 
to the masses as "The Cage" for 
sundry deviated reasons into which 
I will not delve on these pages. It is 
here that I have seen and done 
things that I cannot possibly begin 
to comprehend, even now. 

For example, who is that grubby 
homeless man playing the harmon-
ica on the couch in our front yard, 
rasping out unintelligible lyrics and 
wailing at the moon? And why did 
I just give this man that cup of 
straight vodka? I guess it was just 
the good American thing to do. 

With the Olympics upon us in 
full force, the patriotism that spurs 
such acts is running high , which is 
what these Olympic games are all 
about in the' end.

By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

Wendy Taylor was named last 
week assistant athletic director for 
compliance of UCSD ath letics. 

This position was created 
because of the school's move to the 
Division II level. The duties of a

see all eligibility cenifications. issue 
NCAA rule interpretations and 
handle all initial eligibility issues. 

Taylor is joining the school from 
Virignia Commonwealth University 
in Richmond, Va. She held the posi-
tion of associate athletic director 
and compliance coordinator. 

Taylor graduated from Lehigh 
University in 1991 and picked up a 
master's degree in 1993 in sports 
management from the University 
of Richmond. She held the position 
of compliance assistant at 
Richmond before heading to 
Chicago State University to take on 
the position of compliance and 
academic coordinator. 

She was the assistant commis-
sioner for compliance and champi-
onships for the Big South

Mixed Reviews of Road Tour 
Women's soccer loses to Dominguez 
Hills, rebounds to down CS ULA 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

Traveling can be full of peaks 
and valleys. 

On its first major road trip of 
the season against a pair of 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association rivals, the 
UCSD women's soccer 
team experienced 
both. 

On Friday, 
the Tritons had 
a breakdown 
against Cal 
S tat e 
University Dominguez 
Hills, losing 3-1 . 

On Sunday, UCSD kicked it 
into high gear, making roadkill 
of Cal State University Los 
Angeles 7-0. 

The loss against CSU 
Dominguez Hills was a close one 
and easily could have turned out 
differently. 

"We played a good team," 
said Triton Head Coach Brian 
McManus. "We had the chance 
to win the game, but we made 
some mistakes. We're just 
unlucky. We're unlucky with our 
shots." 

Erika Alfredson scored the 
lone goal for the Tritons, con-
necting with the net in the nnd 

minute. Alfredson had 
numerous good shots 

that narrowly 
missed their 
marks. 

Christy 
Abizaid assisted 

Alfredson on the goal. 
The Toros had a high-

light machine in Tanya Wilson. 
Wilson connected with the net 
three times, scoring her team's 
entire trifecta of goals.

'One win and one loss to CCAA rivals 
is the verdict for men's soccer ' 
By ARYIND YAiAN 
Staff Writer 

The men's soccer team split 
two games this weekend, falling 
to Cal State University 
Dominguez Hills but defeating 
Cal State University Los Angeles 
in Los Angeles. 

The match against 
Dominguez Hills proved 
to be an arduous 
match for the 
Tritons, as the 
team from 
Carson, Calif. 
looked dominant 
and poised to continue 
its winnin~ streak. 

The Tntons had a record of 
.5-1-0, with their only loss being 
to Sonoma State University on 
Sept. 17. U~SD seemed ready to 
end its loss five days ago,' but 
CSU Dominguez Hills was no 
easy task. It was ranked No. 15 
coming into the match, and 

UCSD had a chance to put itself 
on the map by pulling off an 

. upset. 
At the end of it all, CSU 

Dominguez Hills was just too 
much for the UCSD men's soc-
cer team on this day. The result 
was a 3-0 victory for the home 
team, as the goals came early and 

. heavy against the Triton 
defense. 

CSU Dominguez 
Hills' Alex 
Bengard scored at 
the 2:05 point, 
and Juan Carlos 
Bolanos followed 

up that goal with 
one of his own after 

just 4 minutes and 12 seconds of 
play. Matt Montoya scored the 
final goal at the 26:50 point. and 
this seemed to be the dagger that 
took UCSD out of contention.

Club Sports Program Has a Lot to Orf. 
NCAA-recognized sports are not the onry competitions in which Tritons,play their hearts out 
ByTAlTMIUD 
Staff Writer 

Each year 400 to 500 ath letes 
give up their days and nights to go 
out and compete for UCSD. These 
are not the Triton baseball and 
bJls,ketball players. but those stu-
dents involved in club spons. 

Year round, from Mission Bay 
to Mammoth, Calif. to New York, 
Triton athletes in the guise of a 
club sports team show their wares 
in such spons as cycling, rugby 
and ballroom dance. 

Scott Berndes. director of the 
club sports prosram for the past 
15 years, has witnessed and pre-
cipitated its growth and emer-
gence as one of the best programs 
around. 

"In my opinion we have one of 
the strongest programs in the 
nation," Berndes said. "We have 
17 spon teams and our teams are 
national champions two times in 
rugby, three times in surfing. We 
won the Western League in hock-
ey last year, so not only do we have 
a healthy program but our athletes 

and students are performing really 
well." 

Within the UC system, only 
UC Santa Barbara and UC Davis 
rival UCSD in the strength of their 
programs. but those universities 
receive about twice as much 
money per year as UCSD for club 
sports. 

niton club spons receive 
money from two different areas. 
The A.S. Council contributes 
$17,000 annually, and $60,000 to 
$70,000 is allocated from student · 
registration fees. This allows 

approximately $3,000 per team. 
A school like Santa Barbara or 

Davis gets about $200,000 a year 
for programs of comparable size. 

This makes the financial oblig-
ation footed by the athletes rather 
large, and Berndes estimates that 
on average each player shells out 
somewhere around $1,000 a year 
to play. 

For example, each time the 
hockey team wants to practice, it 
has to pay $200 to usc the rink.
