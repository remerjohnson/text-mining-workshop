Committee recommends to 
keep parking for freshmen 
Administration's decision to be made 
after assessment of added services 
By GEOFF DlmleH 
News Editor 

The Transportation Policy 
Committee has recommended 
keeping parking privileges for 
freshman residents on West 
Campus next year. 

T he recommendation was to 
Vice Chancellor of Business Affairs 
Steven W. Relyea, who will have 
the final say in the matter. 

The committee discussed plac-
ing restrictions on freshman resi-
denr parking at its April 7 meeting. 
It was hoped restrictions would 
mitigate the loss of nearly 400 
West Campus spaces next year due 
to construction. T he committee 
discouraged the restrictions so it 
could defer its final recommenda-
tion until it could first see the 
effects of new carpool and shuttle 
ervices to be offer~d next year. 

"Freshman [resident] restric-
tions were one of several additional 
policy options being discussed. to 
maintain reasonable parking avail-
ability," said Adrian Borsa, the 
gradua te student representa tive to 
the committee. "But the option is 
now much further down the list of 
possible actions." 

The TPC, which is advisory and 
has no decision-making authority, 
advised creating shuttle service to 
off-campus housing areas as well as 
marking additional student carpool 
spaces at closer, more convenient 
locations between faculty and taff 
parking areas. 

If implemented, one shuttle 
route will serve the University City 
area and another will link the Mesa 
Aparonents on Regents Road and 
the Scripps Institution of

Paliso~l drops out of race 
TOGAA candidate backs .l ew Wave s Han en 
By BRENT HECHT 
Staff Writer 

Phil Palisoul. the Together Our 
Goals Are Achieavable slate's candi-
date fo r A.S. presldem, announced 
Wednesday that he has withdrawn 
from the election and that he will 
support New Wave's candidate 
Dave Hansen. 

Palisoul said he made his deci-
sion to support Han en and to 
draw votes away from contenders 
Colin Parent of the Action slate 
and Jenn Brown of the Students 
First slate. 

"r truly feel [Hansen] is the best 
candidateJor the job," Palisoul said. 
"He is dedicated to the improve-
ment of campus life. He is not out 
for personal gain. He is truly dedi-
cated tOward improving student 
life." 

Palisoul 's decision came after he 
was not endorsed by the Triton 
Athletics Council and the 
GUllrdian, he said. 

The TOGAA and New Wave 
slates are similar in their expressed 
desire for increased student life 
reforms and getting fresh blood 
into the A.S. Council, Palisoul 
said. 

Most of Palisoul's slate fo llowed 
his lead and withdrew from the 
election. Stefanie Barrierre, who is 
running for A.S. services and enter-
prises cOlTunissioner, is the only 
remaining TOGAA candidate. 

Palisoul said he believes that 
Barrierre has what it takes to win 
her race.

and Williams attributes thi year's 
relatively high rurnout to the vast

running for that position this year. 

Students expressed a variety of

Parking: 
Freshman decision will 
be put off until next year 
Continued from page 1 
Oct:anography. 

The committee is hoping these 
measures will ease the demand for 
student parking, director of 
Transportation and Parking 

Sef\~ces Greg Snee said. 
"I am both excited and encour-

aged by the TPC's vision to recom-
mend implememation of these new 
alternative transportation shuttle 
systems for next fa ll," Snee said. 
"The goal is to provide both an 
Inexpensive and conveniem alter-
native for srudents, staff and faculty 
who chose not to purchase parking 
permits. " 

Borsa said he expects the new 
se rvices will, in fact, reduce 
demand for parking on campus by 
graduate srudents who live at Mesa, 
but all students will reap the bene-
fits . 

"We can actually see the possi-
bility of eliminating the need for 
any restrictions if we can encourage 
enough UCSD commuters to leave 
their cars at home," Borsa said. "A 
number of the committee members 
are very positive about the poten-
oal for gerting people away from 
their cars." 

Snee agrees. 
"If we can get a significant num-

ber of people to use these systems 
volulltarily, we may be able to avoid 
implementing restrictions 01) fresh-
man residents in the fall of 2003," 
he said. 

If parking use is not significant-
ly reduced this fall, the TPC will 
begin developing plans to reduce it 
by possibly restricting parking priv-
ileges for freshman residents in fall 
2003 . 

Currently, UCLA and UC 
Berkeley have reStrictions on fresh -
man resident parking. Such a 
change at UCSD would not go 
over lightly, according to A.S .

Paper tests show evidence of 
Alzheimer's before it develops 

Researchers at UCSD's Alzheimer's disease 
Research Center have found that "paper-and-pencil" 
neuropsychological tests administered to subjects 
averaging 75 years of age showed signs of cognitive 
decline in those subjects who later developed 
Alzheimer'S disease. . 

The research looked at results from 40 partici-
pants in a long-term study and found that the tests 
contained subtle evidence of the onset of cognitive 
decline. 

While all subjects were symptom-free at the time 
of testing, 20 of them were diagnosed with 
Alzheimer's disease within two years of testing, while 
the other 20 remained symptom free. The 
researchers used the 20 symptom free subjects as a 
control for the experiment. 

The study was funded with support from the 
Veterans Administration, Veterans Medical Research 
Foundation a:1d the National Institute on Aging.

A.S. ELEaJONS 

car enters eledion 
zone on Library Walk 
New Wave found not guilty 
for actions of sympathizer 
By GEOff DIETRICH 
News Editor 

A rogue sympathizer of the 
New Wave slate nearly brought 
down the New Wave campaign 
by driving his poster-laden 1994 
Ford Escort station wagon down 
Library Walk on Wednesday. 

Opposing slates and candi-
dates filed a complaint against the 
driver, Bryan Barton. They 
argued the action violated elec-
tion by-laws regarding campaign-
ing and posting within 50 feet of 
voting stations. 

An A.S. elections committee 
inquiry found the slate not guilty 
for Barton's actions because 
Barton is not a ew Wave slate 
member. 

Parisa Baharian of the Action 
slate, avneet Grewal of the 
Students First slate and William 
Tunick. an independent candidate 
running for vice president of 
finance, brought the complaint to 
the committee. 

At the hearing held by the A. . 
elections comlllittee, many ew 
Wave slate member were present 
10 defend and distance themselves 
from tlle driver and his actions. 

New ''''ave slate members tes-
tified that they were outraged by 
Barton, who they only vaguely 
knew, if at all . 

Baharian questioned Ryan 
Darby, who is ew Wave's candi-

date for commissioner of commu-
nications, regarding hi s role in 
providing Barton with the 
posters. 

Darby testified that Barton 
asked him for New Wave posters 
to place on his car. Darby obliged, 
seekin~ publicity for his slate's 
campaIgn. 

Barton arrived late to the 
Wednesday meeting, holding a 
prepared statement that he 
deemed "Exhibit A," of which he 
read. 

"Last Tuesday, on my own 
accord, T taped three large ban-
ners to my car and went on a 
joyride about the campus," 
Barton read. 

Barton contends his ride 
ended when he drove up to the 
New Wave slate members who 
were in the Student Center fixing 
posters as "they 211 approached 
my car en mas e, shouting things 
like, ·What the hell are you 
doing~' and 'Are you trying to get 
us disqualified?' And then they 
ri pped a II the posters off my car 
and made me leave in shame." 

Garo Bournoutian, the New 
Wave vice president finance can-
didate who first saw the car while 
manning the New Wave table on 
Library Walk, described his first 
emotion as "bewildennent." 

"I was quite amazed that he

Turnout: 
Library Walk station has 
helped numbers 
Continued from page 1 
Many were solely concerned about 
the athletic referendum, which 
requires at least 3,700 srudents to 
vote in order to pass, regardless of 
whether students vote for or 
against it. 

"I think it's very helpful. Very 
convenient for me, and probably 
for every other student here." aid 
Roosevelt junior John Kellar about 
the A.S.-sponsored voting station 
on Library Walk, noting that he 
had voted in every election while 
attending UCSD. 

The station, consisting of 12 
laptop computers leased by the A.S. 
Council, is open from 10 a.m. to 4 
p.m. each day. and usually has open 
spots except during passing peri-
ods. 

"Because half the people are 
unaware and don't care, I don't 
think they have any right to COIll-
plain if they don't vote," said 
Revelle junior Tracy Ho. "This is 
the first time [I've voted] for elec-
tions. I usually vote on the referen-
dums, though." 

Anthony Bellor, a Warren senior, 
had not yet voted, but plans 10. 

"I notice tllat this year they're 
offering the voter pamphlets, and 
Ulat's very good, but I'd like to see a 
bit more of a push from A.S. to get 
people to vote every year," he said. 

Other srudents agreed on the 
importance, but were apathetic to 
voting itself. 

"I don't know if its really going to 
count. I mean, yeah, it's important, 
but I don't really know if I'm going 
to vote this quarter," said Revelle 
junior William Pascua, who has 
never voted in a school election. 

Some students openly expressed 
their disdain for the school's elec-
tion process. 

"All the candidates suck," said 
Zeus Sevilla, a Revelle junior. lO T 
don't think it really matters, hon-
estly. I will vote because there 's a 
couple people I know who want to 
get elected. Hone tly, though, I 
don 't think it really makes a differ-
ence who wins." 

Sevilla did not completely dis-
count tlle importance of voting, 
however. 

"I vote for the student referen-
dums, but not these kinds of elec-
tions," he said. "ReferendUlns will 
affect my social life, not ju t my wal-
let. That kind Qf matters. I feel that 
my opinion gets lost somewhere. 
When you vote for a referendum. it's 
sort of like your opinion." 

Said Marshall sophomore 
Lindsay Hamilton: "This year, 1 
don't think I really know enough 
about the candidates to choose a 
candidate. I'm just going to vote for 
the referendum, acrually." 

"In general, voting is impor-
tant," said Revelle sophomore Jan 
Schellenberger. 

However, when asked about 
whether voting at UCSD was 

NEWS 3 

important, he said, "In general , no. 
I don't plan to vote. I don't know 
any of the candidates or their plat-
fo rms. I voted las t year beca us;: I 
knew some of the people who were 
runni ng." 

vVilli ams was pleased th~t the 
election was on track to meet 
rurnOllt expectations, but walllS 10 
alter the bylaws to make the inter-
face easier to 1I e. 

"Next time we'd like to take the 
candidate statements off of the on-
line ballot and let people refer to 
the paper copies, just leaving the 
names," Williams sa id III rcgard to 
the problems StudentLink was hav-
ing with delivering the "enormous 
amount of information." 

vViliiams added, "I'd rt:ally 
encourage everyone to vote. From 
their personal computers at home, 
they can vote 24 hours a day on 
StudentLink." 

Voting runs until 4 p.m. Friday. 
Students can vote on StudentLink 
from any Internet-connected com-
puter, or on Library Walk near the 
Price Center froIll 10 a.m. to -l 
p.m.

Eliminating 
parking will 
not solve woes 

Over the last year the Transportation Policy 
Coounittee has been deliberating whether to 
revoke parking privileges fi-om on-campus resi-
dents. The Gllardian finds that tlus supposed 
solution to the escalating parking problem 
should be avoided if at all possible. 

This plan would - at be t - constitute a 
temporary and reactionary solution. However, 
UCSD needs a long-term answer to tl1e contin-
u31 overcrowding of our parking lots and struc-
tures. As ixth College works its way onto cam-
pus next fall , and as the number of fi-eshman and 
transfer adnuts contimies to rise, it is obvious 
that the current parking faci lities available to 
students - even if accentuated by a throng of 
"S" parking spaces that would be opened by a 
revocation of freshman parking privileges -
likely won't make up for any current deficien-
cies. Furthermore, removing resident parking 
on west campus seems to be a slippery slope, 
eventually leading to a removal of aU student 
parking on west campus. 

At some point, UCSD will finally have to 
unload money, time and effort toward a viable, 
long-term solution to the parking problem. 
Quickly fi-eeing up a few hundred "s" spots by 
revoking parking rights for on-campus residents 
is simply an attempt to delay that much-needed, 
long-term solution, and in a few years, those 
spots that would be made avai lable by t1Us poli-
cy will be filled, fought over and impossible to 
find . Acceptable and realistic solutions - which 
are currently in the works and should continue 
to be worked on by the appropriate parties -
must decrease demand through alternative 
options such as improved mass transportation 
(how about that trolley stop?), increased num-
bers of carpool-only "S" spots, and expanded 
shuttle services. 

In addition, the plan to remove on-campus 
parking privileges would strip students of rights 
to which they should be entitled as attendees and 
residents of this university. Such a change would 
inevitably send a loud, clear message about stu-
dent,' rights at UCSD to possible recruits, and 
any plan to trim the parking privileges of one 
class of students creates notable and inexplicable 
mequities based simply on acadenlic class and 
age. This policy would thereby create an immea-
surable difference in quality of life among on-
campus and off-campus residents, and in turn, 
could hurt UCSD's recruitment efforts. 

Another issue of concern regarding t1Us 
proposition is me approval of the "one-rate" 
housing and dining plan, which will force all on-
campus residents to purchase meal plans. The 
parking proposal, when considered in conjunc-
tion with one-rate, appears to be one more step 
tOward stripping on-campus residents of fi-ee-
doms and rights to which mey are entitled. 

Finally, with "improving campus life" so high 
on me lists of goals of a multitude of A.S. 
Council candidates t1Us election week, it would 
behoove the winners of t1Us election to fight t1Us 
policy and remain true to their campaign 
pronlises of fostering a sense of community at 
UCSD. Inevitably, an A.S. Council that allows 
on-campus resident parking privileges to be 
hacked away at by the administration would 
only inhibit any notion of unity and A.S. 
COlUlcil integrity at UCSD.

THE FASHION TREND THATS SWEEPING THE NATION! 

Hope lies in the people of Israel, 
not in the nation's leaders 

Prime Minister Sharon's aggressive and unjust 
acts against Palestinians must be accounted for 

By SIMONE SANTINI 
Senior Staff Writer 

It 's hard to say something about th e 
situation in the Middle East. Somehow, 
one has the impression that everything 
worth sayi ng has been said, together 
with a fair amount of things not worth 
saying. 

Rationality has, unfortunately, quite 
abandoned a confronta tion in which one 
of the opponents has been enduring a 
brutal occupation for the laSt 20 years 
whil e the other is under the constant 
threat of suicidal terrorists, and the polit-
ical players in the crisis leave little space 
to hope. 

Ariel Sharon, the prime ntinister of 
Israel , is more or less the worst person 
that could cover such a delicate role. In a 
more fair world, he would have been sen-
tenced as a war criminal for hi role in 
the massacres in the Palestinian ca mps of 
Sabra and Chatila 20 years ago, in which 
3,000 Palestinians, mostly women and 
children , were ki lled by the Lebanese 
army under Israeli protection. Only the 
intense fear of weakening the position of 
[srael saved Sharon from being sent to 
jai l by his own government, and he was 
freed with the ambiguous formula of 
"criminal negligence." What credibility 
this man can have in any negotiation 

. with the Arabs is anybody's guess. 
Arafat is a spent leader who was 

unable, in the time following the Oslo 
accords, to create a credible structure of 
government that could survive without 
him. That ancient sin of the Arab polit-
ical class - the cult of personality - is 
coming back to haunt him. Israel suc-
ceeded in discrediting Arafat by as king 
him to stop terrorism: an impossible 
task. 

The American government, ruling 
over an orderl y and , a)) in all , not too 
fanati cal country, couldn 't stop the 
Oklahoma hombing, the bombing at the 
Atlanta Olympics or dozens of cruy 
killing rampage. After having systemati-

cally undermined his power in rhe rur-
bulent Palestinian situation, to ask Arafat 
to compl ete ly stop the terrorist attacks or 
to be consi_dered responsible is pure 
madness , and reveals a clear will to 
undermine any political settlement. 

With a discredited Arafat and his 
Palestinian Authority left powerless, 
Sharon will have the opportunity to 
move heavily into the territories. 1b him, 
it matters little that this will signify a fur-
ther increase in terrorist attacks and 
Israeli civilian casua lties. He understands 
the dynamics o f terrorism and is using 
this understanding to his own advantage. 

Ariel Sharon, the prime 
minister of Israel ... in a 

more fair world ... would 
have been sentenced as a 
war cr iminal for his role in 

the massacres in the 
Palestinian camps of Sabra 

and Chatila 20 years ago, 
in which 3,000 

Palestinians, mostly 
women and children, were 

killed by the Lebanese 
army under Israeli 

protection. 

A third player in the region is the 
United States, whose role has always 
been ambiguous. The United States' 
support of Israel , whatever its source and 
its rationale, has pretty much ruled it out 
as a possible negotiator, leading to a dead 
end. Arab coun.tries don't trust the 
United States as a mediator - Israel is 
trying to impose it. Only U.S. withdraw-
al from the negotiations and a carte 
blanche to whomever will step in could 
solve this impasse. 

T he problem is that such a move 
would leave the matter in the hand of a 
fourth player: Europe, which is the pri-
mary cause of today's troubles. After 
World War II, shocked by the holocaust 
and feeling (not unreasonably, at the 
ti me) that J ews would not be safe in 
Europe, the Europea n powers refilrned 
them to a land to which they were ti ed by 
old bibli cal prophec ies, but from which 
they were sepa rated by 2,000 ycars of 
historY. The Arabs took the decision with 
the ~ame enthusiasm with which 
Californi ans would take the decision to 
return the whole state to the native 
Americans (who, at least, have a much 
clo er col1l1 ection to it) . 

Worse, the European powers created 
the state of Israel and left the scene with-
out dea ling politically with Arab coun-
tries to guarantee the accep tance and the 
security of the new state. 

Yet in spite of everything, there is 
some hope. Hope is in th e people of 
Israel, who arc better than the ruling 
class that represents them. It lies In Rohy 
Damellin, whose 29-year-old son wa's 
killed by a Pal estinia~ sniper and who 
publicly asks why he was sent to fight and 
die in an unjust and oppressive war. It lies 
in Michal Pundak, who shows the pi cture 
of an Israeli soldier aiming his gun at two 
Palestinian kids with raised hands . 
Pundak compares it to another picture, 
50 years old : a Jewish child in Warsaw, 
wearing short pants and an old overcoat, 
terrorized , hands raised , a Nazi aiming a 
gun at him. One of the photos is a sym-
bol of the Shoah. She asks : "Did we 
become like them ?" 

The hope is that the movements that 
ask why the people of Israel , who know 
the most brutal of oppressions, have 
become the oppressor; who ask Israel to 
stop every intervention beyond th e 
1967 borders, who understand that th e 
stupid, desperate, fanatic spiral of ter-
rori sm will not be arrested unless there 
is a fair political resolution of the occu-
pation

Editor: 
I want to inveigh against those who auto-

matically assume that it's a bad thing to have 
student photos avai lable on Smdentlink. All 
the press for this measure has been negative, 
and some A.S . candidates are even including 
a revocation of the photos as parr of their 
campaign pledges . 

At first, I felt the same way many stu-
dents do aboltt the photos, but I don't 
believe they are such a bad thing after all. 
I've had a few professors and TAs who have 
quickly memorized the names of all their 
students in fair-si1.Cd classes because they 
used photo printouts of the class roster from 
Srudentlink. Ins tead of creating a divisive 
amlOsphere, the instructors' familiarity with 
their students made it easier for us all to par-
ticipate in class discussions and feel wel-
come, which, I think, is probably the high 
hopes that the ad ministration had for this 
measure all along. 

If people are worried about vindictive 
instructors misusing the Studentlink photos, 
that is a reasonable concern . However, that 
points to a problem which is in and of itself 
very different from the issue of the profes-

sors mowing the names of srudents; the 
matter of biased and unfair instructors is a 
serious concern that should be handled sep-
arately. 

Students should stOP worrying so much 
about having their identities compromised in 
class and ! hOuld instead enjoy the good that 
can come I'rom being known by their instruc-
tors (a ber efit which, dare I say, we would 
enjoy if we were at a private university).

My name is Denny Oh and I am a srudent 
at UCSD. I have known and been (and con-
tinue to be) a close friend of Peter Butcher for 
the past four years, and have even lived with 
him for a portion of this time. I am writing to 
address the article that the Gum'diall printed 
in its April 8 edition on Butchers arrest, as 
well as all of the other ridiculous accusations 
that have been made. The media has obvious-
ly not even investigated his arrest, as he was 
not even in Santa Barbara, Calif. when the last 
arrack occurred. Accusing him of being some 
sort of psychotic pervert is not only absurd, it 
is entirely uncalled for, as it only serves the 
media to cause a stir and increase their rat-
in!,'5. 

Anyone who knows Butcher would say 
that he is incapable of such an. act and that he 
did not do it. While the Gllordion has done a 
better job at only reporting what the police 
are saying, I still feci that it is unfair and 
unethical to condemn an innocent person by 
labeling him as some sort of pervert with a 
fetish. While these news reports and articles 
do not and will not change the views of 
Butcher's friends, little can be said about those 
who do not mow him. 

In conclusion, all I have to say is that tltis 
event has placed a great deal of doubt in tile 
minds of many as to how we)) our police force 
does its job. As for the media, I guess little 
more can be expected .

Stereotypes abound in 
American culture 
Asian -Americans often feel marginalized 
By ANNIE PAN 
Staff Writer 

I paid a memorable vtm to the 
Department of Motor Vehicl es during 
spring break. After what seemed like hours 
of endless waiting, 1 fina ll y progressed to the 
front of the line. The lady behind the desk 
glanced at me, and everythin g that happened 
afterward. was in slow motion. 

The petite lady talked at the retarded 
pace of a rurtle while exaggerating her hand 
gestures to the absolute extreme. 

Furthermore, as ifl would not understand 
her o therwise, she spoke with an intentional, 
forceful Asian accent. (It is interesting to note 
that she had approached the previous people 
in line with total n nnalcy.) 

At that point, I understood why she was 
treating me differently from the others. My 
yellow skin was the blatant determining fac-
lOr of her decision to assume that I didn 't 
speak any English. 

I was in so much shock that I simpl y 
stood there with a blank tare. She inter-
preted my reaction as inabili ty to understand 
her slow-paced, scattered words. Her heart 
swelled with sympathy for the little Asian 
immi gran t. 

The Ilext thing I knew, the lady was shov-
ing me to where I was supposed to go and 
grabbing my hand for a fingerprint . She 
grew very silent when I fina lly spoke up . 

In an apologetic tone, she returned to her 
normal way of talking: "Mmm ... your ... 
perfume smells great. What kind is it?" The 
lady at the DMV certainly proved to be a 
helpful host to the guests of this country. 

Many believe that racial discrimination 
requires negative treatment. That idea , 
however, does not always hold true. 

The DMV employee wa,s merely trying to 
assist someone who she thought could not 
understand English. But the simple act of 
projecting racial stereotypes on me, of assum-
ing that I didn't understand Engli h, was 
equally as discriminatory as stating explicitly 
that T do not belong in the Uniteu tates. 

Asian-Americans arc viewed as pcrpettml 
foreigners. In the 2002 Wimer Ol ympi cs, 
figure skater Michelle Kwan tragically fe ll 
during her performance. 

Despite the fact that K wan refers to her-
sel f as an American and represents the 
United States in world skating competitions, 
her Chinese ancestry was repeatedly empha-
sized throughout the media . Evidently, in 
spite of generations of permanent rC~J[ l cncc 
in th is country, Asian-Americans ;1fI: stdl 
seen as guests of the United St~ tes. 

In the American popular media , .\".'11' 
are almost always portrayed as a lt en~ I I ho 
are unwilling and unable to assnn ilatc Jnd 
who cannot speak Engl ish. 

M edia portrayals have instinctively led to 
the way peopl e regard Asians toua),. ,\Iost 
people don't even rea lize tha t they look .It 
Asians with discriminating eyes. The mcth;! . 
for example, may have thought that acknowl-
edging Kwan's ethnici ty through constam 
repetition was an act of consideration. ' Ill 
acknowledge one's ethnic background is a 
wonderful gesrure, but not when it is done to 
the extent of inflated deliberation. Insread, I 
find it to be a degrading act of perpetuating 
the perceived foreignness of Asians. 

It is tragic that Europeans who have 
recently settled in the United States arc con-
sidered "Americans" by the general pubhc, 
while Asians who have resided in the UllIted 
States for countless generations arc still 
being asked, "Where arc you from?"

Incoming admits post lower scores 
S.A.T., GPA both down from last year's numbers 
By TOM NEELEY 
Contributing Writer 

Earlier this month UCSD sent 
out 16,338 offers of admission to 
prospective members of the class of 
2006. Of 40,962 applications, about 
40 percent rece ived admission 
offers. UCSD received the.second-
most applications of all the UC 
campuses, behind only UCLA. 

Last year 37,66 1 applied to 
UCSD and 15,226 received admis-
sion offers. 

"In terms of the admitted Stu-
dents. we were pleased with the 
qualiry of the applicants we 
received," said Mae Brown, acting 
ass istant vice chancellor for enroll -
ment mana({emen t. 

The ave~age GPA was 4.03 and 
the average S.A.T. composite score 
was 1~ 82 . Last yea r's ad mits had an 
average GPA of 4.04 and an aver-
age SAT composi te score of 1304. 

T he mo t popular intended 
majors of the admitted ~rudents 
retlect the a ppeal of the sc iences 
Jl1d engillcerillg. Biology, bioengi-
neering, economics, computer sc i-
ence lmd psychology were the most 
popular choices. 

CSD hopes to have about 
4,100 choose to matriculate. 
Prospective stlldents have until May 
1 to ~end in their IIltem to register.

had our posters. 1 have never seen 
this guy before." Bournoutian said. 
"He is not part of our slate." 

Darby defended his givi ng of 
posters to Barton, but acknowl-
edged he may be held responsible. 

"I in no way authorize, condone 
or have any kn owledge of thi s 
whatsoever," Darby said. 

Barton said he did not tell Darby 
or the slate of his plans to drive on 

replaces the former sy tem where 
50 to 75 percent of srudents were 
admitted based solely on a srudent's 
academic record. 

"We think it is a good process, a 
very fai r process," Brown said. 

New considerations in this 
year's admissions process have 
allowed a variery of factors to be 
considered. Those factors include 
socio-economic background, com-
muniry service, leadership, special 
circumstances and talents, parents' 
education and school envi ronment. 
The factors are qu.antified into a 
point system. 

"We have, for example, identi-
fied what the definition of a major 
role in leadership is, such' as did the 
srudent have considerable responsi-
bi li ty." Brown explained. 

Signifi cant leadership experi-
ence, such as being a rudent body 
presi dent or an editor in chief of 
the school paper, earns an appl icant 
300 points. Other leadership expe-
rience, such as being a preSident of 
a club or a minor editor for the 
school paper, is worth 150 points. 

However, Brown emphasized 
tha t a srudent's GPA, course selec-
tion and standardi z.ed test scores 
are sti ll of primary consideration. 

"The most considerable weight 
in the ad missions process goes back 
to strong academic achievement," 
she said. "That carries the most sig-
nifi cant weight in all our ad mis-
ions policies." 

Addilionallv. UCSD admitted 
5, 06 srudents'who wcre identified 
as "eligible in the local context." 
The ELC in itiative propo ed by 

Library Walk, nor did Darby ask 
him to drive through campus. Darby 
testified he thought Barton would 
drive only on roads that compose 
Campus Loop. He ,lsked Bartnn to 
be sa fe by not placing the SIgns over 
the ca rs wmdows. 

Barton seemed to have pleaded 
ignorance to possibly breaking 
campaign rules, 

"I had no clue that that was a 
rule at all . \'vhen I drove by I saw 
a tent there ... ['m like, 'Dude, is 
that then like where the voters arc?' 
I didn't know that tent was where 
they were voti ng until now." 

Barton repeatedly apologiz.ed 
for his actions, he said he hopes it 

Richard Atkinson, president of the 
Universiry of California, target 
UC-eligible students identified by 
their high schools who are in the 
top 4 percent of their class. This 
program is open to all California 
p.igh schools. 

The ELC srudents admitted to 
UCSD have an average GPA of 
4.17 and an average SAT composite 
score of 12 73. 

With regard to diversiry figures, 
UCSD registered the most signifi-
cant gains of all the campuses. This 
year, 14.4 percent of admitted sru-
uems come from historically 
underrepresented groups at 
UCSD. Last year the same indica-
tOr was 11.5 percent. 

"We are very pleased with the 
ethnic diversity of the class." Brown 
said. "We've been working very hard 
really not only through recruionent 
but also to rea lly make UCSD 
appealing to a diverse group of ml-
dents - ethnic diversiry, cui rural 
diversity, economic diversity." 

For this year 's admitted Stu-
dents, 78 identify as America n 
Ind ia n, 330 identify as Afri can 
American and 1,939 identify as 
Mexican-American or Latino. 

Of the 5,806 admitted ELC sru-
dents, about 28.4 percent come 
from histori ca lly underrepresented 
groups. 

Overall, Brown was pleased 
with the product of this ~'ear 's 
admission process. 

"We have admitted a wonderful-
ly strong class in terms of academic 
performance," she said. "And we've 
admitted a vcry diverse class." 

does not affect the slate 's standing. 
Anv number of actions could 

have be taken, including limiting 
~e\V W;we's campaigning or dis-
qualifying the slate. 

New Wave was pleased with the 
decision. 

"I'm very glad the committee 
found the false charges to be false," 
said New Wave candidate for 
Marshall senior senator and leader 
of the defense, Robert 
Forouzandeh.

THUR 'DAY, APRIL II. 2002 THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATL.:~ 9 

Through the decades: a journey through pop culture from the 19505 into the future 
'50s '60s '70s '80s beyond 

The 19905: 

Progr -. sing into the Future 
T ry searching for a si ngular experience that encapsulates the fee ling of the '90s. Although they say that hind -
sight is 20-20, no one knows how long 
it takes for hindsight to develop. It is 
difficult £0 paint a clear picture of a 
decade that has yet to end in the 
minds of many. Listening to a 
Nirvana record or watching a rerun of 
"Seinfeld " arc experiences that don't 
yet sti r up feelings of nostalgia. So, 
sti ll dizzy from the £Ornado that was 
the I 990s, the Guardian ta kes a look 
at the art and entertainment from that 
decade. 

Music 
Dur ing the 1990s, the likes of 

Vanill a Ice and M .e. Hammer had 
distinctive fa n bases and the genres of 
grunge rock and gangster rap truly 
enthralled and polarized the nation 's 
youth . One faction followed the 
ongoing saga of the heroin addiction 
of Kurt Cobain, while the other fol-
lowed th e battle between the East 
Coast and West Coast and the lives of 
the battles preeminent figures Snoop 
Dog and Dr. Ore and of course Bad 
Boy Records. Both roads had tragic 
similarities. 

Nirvana 's" evermind" contro lled 
l'vITV's airwaves and gave the alterna -
tive youth an icon and an idol. Cobain 
was the poster child for the lost and 
angry teen-ager. He was livid onstage 
and quiet offsta ge. A small garage 
ha nd from WashingtOn had changed 
everything in the world of rock and 
went platinum in the process. 
Meanwhile, the way was paved 
for grunge rock's tamer 
younger sibling: alternative. 

Bands such as Pearl Jl11l1, 
Stone Temple P ilOls and 
Soundgarden laid the foun-
dation for a sound that would 
revive rock and control the air-
waves in the early '90s . 

Meanwhi le, hip-hop 
fans ca me face-to-
face with thug 
Ii festyles and 
em b'r ace d 

their own icons. Debate rolled across 
the nation as increasingly controver-
sial lyrics and videos were released, 
the most apparent examples being 
N . W.A.'s "Fuck the Police" and Ice 
T's "Cop Killa ." 

The powder keg of energy created 
by the musical revolut ions coming out 
of Washing£On and Long Beach, 
Calif., caught a spark from two 
respective wicks in 1994 when Cobain 
commined suicide and Snoop was 
charged with murder. These tragedies 
were the realities of the harsh and bit-
ter worlds of which the artists sang 
of. 

Though gangsta' rap would con-
tinue to thrive and take on new sol-
diers in an ongoing war, the day that 
Cobain pulled th e trigger was 
Generation X's version of the day the 
music died. 

The remainder of the early '90s 
was an aftershock. of the initial quake 
led on by the tragedies of 1994. The 
cycles repeated themselves in alterna-
tive and rap music in the coming years 
with the deaths of Tupac, Biggie 
Smalls and Sublime's Brad Nowell. 
The first phase of early '90s music 
didn't end at any specific point, bllt 
what is certain is that the beginning of 
The end was 1994. 

The self-destruction of great musi-
cians in the early '90s left thl! nation 
weary of tragedy. The success of pop 
re-emerged In the late '90s in full 
force wi th fresh and pretty faces and 
dance routines -the pobr opposite of 
the decade's earlier heroes. The new 

war in music 
was 

between Backstreet and 'Nsync, 
Britney Spears and Christina 
Aguilera, who found their homes on 
MTV via "Total Request Live." T he 
only casualties were th e fans, who 
passed out with exalation at their con-
certs. 

The rock 'n' roll purists were left 
to explore the newest tangent of rock 
'n' roll and punk rock. They wai ted, 
conflicted, for their favorite bands to 
come to their hometOwns, and 
despised the likes of those who waited 
anxiously each day for their favorite 
teen sensation to appear above Times 
Square next to Carson Daly. 

Television 
The progression of American cul-

ture on te levision was most clearly 
seen through the eyes of Matt 
Groeing, creator of "The Simpsons." 
Premiering in late 1989, "The 
Simpsons" took the world by storm 
through the 1990s because of the out-
landish behavior and catchphrases of 
the young Bart Simpson. 

Reruns offer a refreshing look into 
the earlier years of the show, which 
were more dominated by the youthful 
cast . As the show grew older, so did 
the audience's appreciation for the 
more subtle and ingenious truths that 
are now more com monly known as 
"I-Iomeris1l1s. " 

Creating a television show that 
was not bound by the laws of the 
physical world, the age of the actOrs , 
or the age of the ~lUdience ensured the 
possibility of success for the show's 
creators. Tht:se factOrs are second-uy 
to the fact that the show's varied cast 
of characters and zany brand of com-
edy helped to build a cult following 
that now enjoys the show in syndica-

10 HIATUS THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

UCSD artists visualize the conceptual 
University Art Gallery opens exhibit celebrating the visual arts 
By KEELY HYSLOP 
Staff Writer 

A large Aztec pyramid con-structed entirely from empty gre~n plastic suawberry con-
tai ners is on display. Many of the 
co ntai ners still ca rry the stains of 
the fruit tltey o nce held. Imposing, 
mesmerizing, and in the right 
light, the pla stic even appears 
~o lllewha t iridescent - but what 
does it mean? 

In conceptual art, form and 
technique is not important. The 
focus is on the idea rather than 
strict rules.

Art sale: One of Phel Steinmetz's work, La Jolla Village Center, is on display at 
the University Ar1 Gallery through June 16. 

"Object/Conce pt , a Cross-
;\I edia Senes and Exhibition," 
wh ich fea tures concepntal works, 
is o n display April 5 through june 
16 ar the University Art Gall ery. 

T he exhibit marks the 35 th 
,lI1nivcrsar), of UC D's visua l arts 
department, and it features the 
works of 16 UCS D faculty mem-
ben,. 

Jana Minb, the University Art 
Gall ery curator, says the artists 
whose works are exhibited are the 
next generation of faculty artists, 
taking the medium to a new level. 

The show is ca ll ed 
"Object/Concept" because the 
artists have found a way ro illus-
tra te an idea through a - si ngle 
object or a serie of images. 

"Usi ng this technique, the 
artists draw on the cultural and 
personal baggage of tile viewer to 
make associations that wouldn't 
normally exist in the object itself, 
but may be fou nd in its cultural 
context," Minka said. 

The C3 ption adjacent to a 
towcr of green plastic reads, "The

of at least 300 years. Now in 
California, it takes only four years 
to pick 2.5 million tons of straw-
berries. The red berries are picked 
off the ground, one by one." 

The piece is titled "Piramide 
del Sol : A Monument to Invi sible 
Labor." 

Many of the pieces on display 
in the exhibit hold similar reflec-
tions of social and institutional 
critiques, creating art itself. 

Near the front of the exhibit 
is a piece whose place ment seems 
particularly ironic. In big bold 
letters are the words "Art Sale." 
Its compositi on is a reflection of 
"out-of-the-box, " art as a phe-
nomenon rather then a composi-
tion a turn that modern art has 
recentl y taken.

One interesting element of the 
exhibit is a new and innovative 
concept in computer-based art 
forms illustrated by Adriene 
J en ik 's piece , "Moments in 
D esktop Theatcr." 

" Desktop theater is made 
whenever intentional theater-like 
activity wafts through the layers of 
unintentional drama and surreal 
banality in online visual chat 
rooms," je'lik said. 

Since 1997, jenik has per-
formed over 25 different live 
desktop theater experiments. 
These e)(periments range from a 
live performance of "Waiting For 
Godot" interspersed wi th the 
ramblings of a random chat 
room , to an online protest of vio-
lence against woman consisting 
o f three graphics of women

19905: 
The impact of films may not 
be realized until years later 
Continued from pille 9 
tion just as much as the new 
shows. 

"The Simpsons" set the stage 
for later cartoon comedies such as 
"Beavis and Butthead" (the spawn 
of UCSD alummus Mike judge,) 
which hit the scene in 1993 and 
"South Park," which took the 
world by stOrm later in the '90s. 
The longevity of the shows seems 
to vary inversely with the perver-
sion of the subj ect matter. 

Each of the three animated 
series pushed the envelope. And 
all were met with initial criticism 
for promoting foul language and 
destructive behavior in youth. 
Comedy Central 's mature-rated 
"South Park" now makes "The 
Simpsons" characters seem tame. 
The shock value that it initially 
created was converted into gen-
uine ly funny materia l that could 
entertain the young ancl old . 

The birthplace of the reality-
based television shows that now 
flood the airwaves began with 
MTV's "The Real World," creat-
ed by BunimlMurray 
Productions. 

Though the transition to net-
work television took some time, 
there is no question that "The 
Real World" series began it all. 
Offering viewe rs a glimpse into 
the slightly abnormal lives of indi-
viduals whose internal conflict is 
amplified by the subconscious 
awareness of the ever-present 
camera, reality television makes 
viewers feel a little bit normal and 
slightly understood. 

NBC owned the world of com-
edy with an empire built by jerry 
Seinfeld, the master of observa-
tional humor. Ensemble casting

also became very important as 
record-high salaries were paid 
first to the four princi pal actors in 
"Seinfeld. " 

For the first time in entertain-
ment history, comedy actors did 
not have to turn to film projects 
to gain major Hollywood power. 

The most obvious conse-
quence of this was far fewer bad 
films starring television actors. A 
less obvious and disa ppointing 
consequence was shorter-running 
sitcom series . 

For many, the end of the 
"Seinfeld" era came roo soon, and 
their longing tears are dried onl y 
by the syndication episodes that 
now accompany "The Simpsons" 
five nights a week. 

Film 
The film industry is in many 

ways slow-moving, and the influ -
ence that the 1990s' great films 
may not be fully understood for 
many years to come. I n terms of 
numbers, "Titanic" was the most 
influential film of the '90s. With 
an initi al box office take of arou nd 
$600 million , "Titanic" broke all 
previous records and had an even 
greater cul tural influence. It 
caused an industrywide return to 
focusing on the g~nre of the epic 
that had been seemingly ignored 
for the previous two d ecades in 
film. 

It seems beyond understa nding 
that a movie that was nearly three 
hours in length could command 
such great repeated viewings. 

The large audience is attr ibut-
able in great part to the Leonardo 
Dicaprio effect. From the view-
point of the young teenage gi rl it 
is a great value to get to stare at 
Dicaprio for three hours for the 
cost of what would have normally 
been a two-hour film. The tradi-
tional male - though probably ini -

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY ?I, 2002 THE UCSD GUARDIAN HIATU II 

Baha Man 
Move It Like This 
S-Curve Records 

**, 
It was in the summer of 

2000 that the now- infa-
mous dance tWle "Who Let 
the Dogs Out?" became an 
inescapable staple of radio, 
television and film. For bet-
ter or for worse, the song 
left an indelible paw print 
on mainstream music, 
unleashing a pop culture 
phenomenon of, well, 
canine proportions. 

Hoping to avoid the 
one-hit wonder fate of pre-
vious pop aCts (think along 
the lines of the 
"Macarena"), Baha Men 
introduce their latest offer-
ing, "Move It Li ke This." 
Armed with a giddy collec-
tion of upbeat swingers and 
a sampling of syrupy bal-
lads, the group appears 
primed for a second-round 
assal~t on the ears and piggy 
banks of America's youth. 

For those who couldn't 
get enough of the group's 
unabashedly upbeat style , 
the 13 -track set seems to be 
aimed squarely at the same 
audience that ate up the 
pop-ified reggae~rap 
"Dogs." T he album is tai-
lor-mad e for the boom 
boxes of many a junior high 
dance and afternoon barbe-
cue. 

The Caribbean-flavored 
brand of lightweight, corn~ 
ball grooves eases in and 
out of the assortment of 
jangling guitar riffs (" Rich 
in Love") and synth-string 
rhythms ("Giddyup"). The 
title track is a slice of this 
reggae/dance-floor pop 
cheese, an i nfecoous and 
effectively bouncy number. 

Unfortunately, the nov-
city quickly wears thin 
because the flavor of the 
weak sound becomes little 
more than a bad aftertaste 
in the ears. Decidedly com-
mercial and decep tively 
carchy, the . one-note, 
increasingly similar sound 
falls short of maintaining 
the aplomb of the energetic 
mor els heard early on the 
disc's opening tracks. 

Harmless but ultimately 
ineffective, "Move It Like 
This" is unable to drum up 
much llIore than a steady 
beat and an artifi cial plea to 
partygoers.

Ed Harcourt 
Here Be Monsters 

Capitol Records 

***** 
O n your first trip 

through Ed Harcourt's 
"Here Be Monsters," you 
hear II tracks of light-
hearted tunes with lounge -
jazz influences. But upon 
closer inspection , there are 
carefu lly produced layers 
of noise and sound tha t all 
support the si lky-smooth 
vocals of Harcourt. 

This well -crafted album 
travels from depressed 
midnight rambling to 
upbeat and even grunge. 
Listen to this al bum in the 
darkness of your room -
and listen carefully. There 
are layers of sound careful-
ly stacked on top of each 
other and instruments that 
chime in JUSt at the right 
moments to shlmmer in 
ancl out. If you were to play 
the comparison game, you 
could find Harcourt 

. 

reviews 
resembling the sounds of 
Mercury Rev or Space. 

"God Protect Your 
Soul" has a groovy ba s riff 
combined with a lounge 
piano. A red-light district 
trumpet plays in the back-
ground before the song 
erupts into a rush of horns. 
"She Fell Into My Arms" is 
another song that plays 
with a lounge attitude. But 
so me well -placed dimin-
ished and minor chords 
give the song a dark, melan-
cholic color. "Apple of My 
Eye" is a heart-warming 
nme that fills the air with a 
Motown vibe that is soulful 
and rich. 

The magic of "Here Be 
Monsters" is that this mas-
terpiece was produced by 
Tim Holmes, who is also 
known for his work in the 
e1ecuonica outfit Death in 
Vegas . Knowing that a 
dance-music producer was 
at the helm explains the 
clean mixes and beautifully

Sneaker Pimps 
Bloodsport 

Tommy Boy Records 

**** 
" Bloodspo rt " by the 

Sneaker Pimp is definitely 
eclectic, and there is a slim 
chance you can get bored 
with this album. 

T he Sneaker Pimps 
were probably best-known 
for their singles, "6 
U nderground" and "Spin 
Spin Sugar," which fea-
tured the coy vocal style of 
Kelli Dayton . Back then, 
trip-hop beats and trancey 
sou nds comprised the 
Sneaker Pimps sound. 

" Bloodsport," however, 
brings a different angle to 
the music. One ca n hear 
the techno beats and the 
trip-hop bass grooves, but 
there is more of a synth-
rock edge to the album. 
And in an effort to keep 
their music fresh, they have 
parted ways with Dayton. 

The result is an eclectic 

mix of songs that r~ngc 
from down-tcllJpo to 
II1dustrial ~rooves. Some 
of the music IS 'Jlmost rcm-
iniscent of ea rl y Dcpechc 
Mode with the fUZ7. bas, 
and thc reuo-d rulll km. 

In place of Dayton I, 
Sneaker Pimps guirari" 
Chris Corner. While some 
might ay that Dayton'.; 
departure ruins the distin -
guishll1g sound o f the 
band, Corner is lllore than 
ad equa te . He adds an 
enrirelv new dimension 
Jnd so;md to the band. l ie 
has the talent to growl and 
croon his way through the 
album. 

Heartbreaki ng vocals 
complement an acoustic 
guitar with a light key-
board part rounding out 
the so und in "Black 
Sheep." With the Simple 
lyri cs, "And ll1:1ybe then 
you wouldn't get ,0 Sick of 
me," and just enough pop 
in Corner's voice. the song 
"Sick" is a grea t r,ldio-
frie ndly song. 

" B1oodspon" provides;J 
wide selec ti on of ongs and 
tempos to groove to . 
Corner fills in JUSt perfect-
ly with the evolving 
Sneaker Pimps sound. 
T his album might not ha\'c 
the hit ingles. but it worb 
perfectly if you listen to It 
from beginning to end.

By ANNE CONG-HUYEN 
Staff Writer 

U CSD will receive a diverse foursome of stand-up cOlllcdi -am for Frida y nlghr ', 
Ambassadors of Comedl' sho\\" at 
Poner 's Pub. The ev~nr sho w,> 
great promise by billing lour sea-
soned comedians: J cff Hodge, 
Sheila Rivera, Bobhl" Lee and 
Gerry Bednob. . 

Hodge has been a st:lIld-u)1 
comedian for 12 years. \Vith hi pre-
vious contributiom in •. rocodtlc 
DlUtdee in L.A.," "Duece Bignlo\\' : 
Male Gigolo," and as a wrirer for the 
"The Keenan Ivory Wayans Sho" ," 
Hodge has proven thar he know~ 
how to make people laugh. 

Rivera graduated from lexa~ 
A&M as an aerospace enginecr and 
spent seven years working as an 
engineer for th e McDonnell 
Dougla Space Shuttle Program. 
But alas, she was destined to be a 
comedian insread . 

Having performed on "The 
Martin Short show," Telemundo TV 
and at the world famous Laugh 
Factory, Rivera will present snldenu. 
with an eclectic humor that tran-
scends language and gender barriers.

named Mr. Korea, has been making 
people laugh for eight years . He', 
been on Comedy Central', 
"Premium Bl end" and NBC); "Late:

'The Sweetest Thing' fails to capture 
the magic of the Hollywood formula 
Cameron Diaz performs poorly, flounders without the 
help of her zany male co-stars of previous films 
By MARA EVANS 
Staff Writer 

The writers in Hollywood are not mathematicians. If they were, they could make the rraditional gross-our 
comedy formula work. Unfortunately, 
H oll ywood fail ed agai n wirh "The 
Sweerest Thi ng," a pathetic arrempt to 
duplicate the bell y-laughs generated by 
"There 's Something About Mary." 

The primary factors in this farce are 
Christina (Cameron . Diu) , Courtney 
(C hristina Applegate) and their hapless 
friend Jane (Selma Blair): three beautiful 
bahes looki ng for love. 

While all three women are willing to 
settle for "Mr. Right Now" over tru e love, 
the shenanigan arc getting o ld . Din 's

theater afrer realizing the cry-on-rhe-
shoulder-card would be in play. 

For the other half of the now-seriuus-
Iy polarized Generati on X youth roo 
whom the numbers mean nothing, to 
rhose who despise "TRL" and love punk 
ruck, the seminal film of the 1990s was 
"Pulp Fiction." While "Titani c" wa s 
encouraging studi o ro spend hundreds of 
millions on film s from famous director, 
"Pulp Fiction" reminded everyone of the 
charm of sma ll er-budget independent 
film s from hip young directors with new 
ideas. 

"Pulp Fiction" was revolutionary in that 
it broughr rogether big-name actors to a 
project that really had no huge studio ties. 
The draw for the film came from wanting 
to work with a you ng and ta lented director 
on a film thar would shake the mainstream 
foundations of Hollywood . The success of 
the tilm would help project from relative 
unknowns get made for the rest of the 
decade. 

Written with a distinctivel y fresh look

lows is a giriy, half- hearted combination of

Ever since her breakthrough pe rfor-

comedic caliber. She worked magic when 
playi ng off the comedic talents of Jim 
Carrey and Ben Stiller. But without the

For "The Sweetest Thing," Dia z is

the tilm . The film managed to do all of 
th ese rhmgs and simultaneuusly resurrec t 
John Travolra's film carccl. 

" Pulp Fic tio n" 's characters wrought the 
rype of se lf-induced tragedies thar the gen-
eration was all toO familiar with . It avoided 
the mood of a traged>' because the end of 
rhe storyline did not come ar the end of the 
film . Part grunge and pan gangsrer, irrev-
erent and brilliant , "Pu[p Fiction" was in 
many ways an allegory of the decade in 
which ir was created. 

[f the '90s taught us one lesson, it is that 
anger and rebellion come with a hcavy price 
to pay, and that shock doesn't always have 
great value . 0 one seemed to be sure what 
they were rebelling against, :ind the knee-
jerk reaction to the decade's gre.tt uagedies 
were projected in both the emotionless 
music thar dominated the late parr of the 
decade, and the tragic films that were the 
keystones of the era. Even as this is said, the 
afterglow of the decade fill s our thoughts 
and at the same time blinds us from seeing 
the decade with true clarity. 

The tragic cycle is bound to repeat 
itself because it seems that the n ation's an 
prefers the extremes of boy bands and 
g runge to any sort of equi li brium . While 
half of us wait in antici pati on for the 
nation 's great rragic hero, the uther ha lf 
wi ll dread the da y that 'Nsyn c goes the 
way of ew Kids on the Bluck. 

The '90 were at their best emotiona ll y 
cha rged, while quietly intriguing. The 
truth of whether the decad e will be 
remembered at its best or at its worsr will 
be decided on ly over time.

'Spy Came' evades triviality 
with dazzling DVD feature$ 
Mediocre 'Serendipity' proves to be a 
complete disappointment in film and video 
By BRENT HECHT 
Staff Writer 

" Spy Game" is definitely not an 
Oscar-winner. Starring Brad 
Pitt and Robert Redford, the 

movie 's appeal lies mostly in glam-
our. Fortunately, the DVD version 
embraces the movie's glitziness and 
doesn't try to be something the 
movie is nor. The resul t is a movie-
viewing extravaganza with a high 
degree of coolness. 

Vilal to the qualiry of the DVD is 
an innovative new feature called 
"Covert OPS," which allows viewers 
to watch behind-the-scenes special 
feamres as the movie unfolds. While 
Covert OPS lacks development 
because there are too few oppornl-
nities to view the special footage, it 
still provides a dis-
tinct experience. 

DVD 
REVIEW 

As such, the DVD is a respectable 
addition to any DVD-Iover's library. 

'Serendipity' 
In the opening scene of 

"Serendipity," the movie's female 
lead, Kate Beckinsdale, insults the 
audience by explicitly defining the 
movie's tide; the word "serendipi-
ry," she says, describes a "formnate 
mistake." With only a mediocre 
movie and an extreme pauciry of 
special features, the "Serendipity" 
DVD is definitely a mistake, but 
certainly not a "fortunate" onc. 

Li ke the movie it 

In addition to 
Covert OPS, the 
DVD includes 
content ranging 
from a presenta-
tion on the recruit-
ment practices of 
the CIA to dual

taries by movie

contains, the 
"Serendipity" DVD 
displays very littl e 
originaliry. The 
deleted scenes are 
ho-hum and few in 
number, and the 
behind- the-scenes 
mini -documentary 
is standard fare. 

higher-up to a 
script-to-storyboard featurette on 
director Tony Scott's filmmaking 
process. 

The DVD also include. 
Universal Studio's "Total Axess," 
which uses the Internet to provide 
additional supplementary materials. 
Unfortunately, the content available 
on the Web is less than impressive. 

The .oVD is as amazing on a 
technical level as on a content level. 
With a movie based so heavily on 
special effects and unique cine-
matography, the DVD's high-class 
color fideliry and picture qualiry are 
very welcome. Similarly, the DVD 
does justice to Scott's frequent com-
puter-generated sou nd effects. 

Although the movie it contains is 
not the best example of cinematic 
excellence, the "Spy Game" DVD is 
an excellent example of a DVD that 
does the best with what it is given. 

If anything 
about the special 

features stands out, it's the extreme 
arrogance of writer-director Peter 
Chelsolll in his audio-commentary. 
At one point, he boldly proclaims 
that the reason the DVD only fea-
tures five deleted scenes is that his 
movie "worked so well" right off 
the bar. 

On the technical level, the 
DVD deserves some kudos. The 
sound mixing is excellent; the 
actors voices can be easily distin-
guished from the New York set-
ting's pervasive background noise. 
Also, the movie's time-lapse pho-
tography, while overdone, is par-
ticularly beautiful in crystal-clear 
widescreen. 

Despite its technical merits, the 
"Serendipity" DVD is at best 
rental-only fare. No sappy streak is 
strong enough to ju tify spending 
$30 for this dud.

'Nine Queens' shows the 
realism of society in Argentina 
The story of a burglary gone awry brings 
action with mystery and suspense 
By RUBY CHEN 
Contributing Writer 

Set in Buenos Ai res, the Latin Ame rican fil m " ine Queens" is an accura tC depiction of 
how corrupt soc iery is in modern-
day Argentina. T he plot cenrers on 
the escapades of two low-level con 
men as they become involved in a 
lucrative scheme to sell nine rare, 
expensive, but forged German 
stamps. 

T he story thickens when their 
supposedly perfect and simple plan 
begins to unravel to the point 
where everyone is a thief in some 
respect. Concerns a bout who to 
trust escalate above worries about 
whether the counterfeit stamps will 
be sold successfully. 

Directed by Fabian Bielinsky, 
"Nine Queens" is quite deserving 
of the awards given to it by the 
Argentinean Film Critics 
Association. Most noticeable of the 
awards include best actor, best 
director, best editing, best support-
ing actress and best picture. 

These awards are indeed very 
appropriate because the fast-moving 
pace and twisting plot cannot be 
understood and appreciated without 
the skillful direction of Bielinsky 
and intricate post-production edit-
ing, all of which contribute to 
heighten the intensiry of particular 
conversations or chase scenes. 

Other than skillful direction and 
continuous editing, the acting is 
also very realistic because each 
character 's performance enhances 
the powerful claim that the film 

Film 
REVIEW 

ma kes of the morali ry of 
Arge ntinean citizens. Such direct-
ing, acting and precise editing is a 
clea r representation of how fraud is 
so embedded in the fabric of 
Argentinea n ociery. 

T his is not to say that the fi lm IS 
all drama and action and no CO IllC-
dy. There is a pleasant combination 
of clever wi t mixed wi th some 
irony, romance and a few instances 
of traditional slapstick humor. T he 
ending itself is so loaded with irony 
that after being drawn into the hec-
tic ploy of the film 's main charac-
ters, audiences continue to think 
about and analyze the plot of the 
movie even when it is over. 

Although "N ine Queens" is set 
in Buenos Aires and is mainly a 
reflection of Argentinean sociery, its 
message speaks across borders and it 
realistically shows the power and 
commonaliry of deception among 
people. It is a wonderfully scripted 
film that will keep audiences guess-
ing until the very last scene.

was his fifth home rlln of the sea-

Sonoma Sta te scored five runs off 
three hits and one UCSD error in 
the fourth inning. Three runs came 
on a home run by Cossack center 
fielder Keian Davis. 

Worthington then shut down 
the Tri tons fo r the rest of the 
ga me. He threw seven and two-

even hits, twO runs and two walks. 

He struck out five. His record 
improved to 7 - I.

The Tritons, just three games out 
of first place, face an intense four-

leader Chico State U niversity. 

" ick got as much out of his 
physical skills as anyone to ever 
to play at UCSD," Lanthier 
said. UHe was tenacious and he 
was tough." 

When the team moved to 
Division II basketball for · the 
200 1-2002 season, the physical 
nature of the opponents may 
have increased, but Christenson 
still averaged more than 10 
points per game for his fi nal twO 
seasons. 

"As we moved up to Division 
Il, the size and strength was the 
biggest difference, but we were 
ahle to handle it well as a team 
and this program will continue 

Direct from Russia 

Christenso n ·now has his 
sights set on new goals. 

"Like most people, I am sti ll 
uncertain about the future . I 
know that I eventually want to 
go to business school and do 
something like sports market-
ing," he said. 

However, what is cenain is 
that Christenson had a special 
career at UCSD and the men 's 
basketball team will be sorel v 
pressed to fin I another like hin~.

Water polo narrowly 
misses weekend sweep 
Banana slugs squished in a 
lopsided UCSD victory 
By JEFF CHUNG 
Staff Writer 

The women's water polo team 
completed its Northern 
California swing by facing confer-
ence foes UC Santa Cruz and UC 
Davis, defeati ng the Banana Slugs 
13-9 on April 6, then losing on 
Sunday to the Aggies 7 -4. 

The Tritons came out fast and 
furious against UC Santa Cruz. 
The team cruised to an 11-3 edge 
a frer rhree periods. This lead 
allowed rhe Triton starters some 
needed rest for their next match. 
Even with a small comeback bv 
Sama Cruz in the last period, 
LTCSD held Onto its lead and won 
13-9. 

To finish Ollt the weekend, 
the team facetl rival UC Davis 
for the second consecutive week, 
this time battling the Aggies on 
their home turf. This advantage 
for the UC Davis proved pivotal, 
as the .'\ggies defeated the 
Tritons 7-4. 

"They got the necessary 
bounces to win," Sanders said . 
"We played II solid game aild I 
feel we 're the better team, hut 
home field plays a role and it 
showed. " 

"It wa a tough loss to take," 
added junior Danjelle Boyle. "But 
it was a learning experience to 
grow on." 

The team will not have much 
time to think about this past 
weekend as they head to Long 
Beach this weekend for the Long 
Beach State University

UCS U's James Kimball had :1 

Invitational. The teams compet-
ing in this tournament include 
San Diego State, UC Irvine, 
Arizona State and host Long 
Beach State. 

Also in the mix is current No. 
I-rlllked University of outhern 
Ca lifornia, which recently 
knocked off former No. I 
Stanford University. Provided 
that the Tritons win their opening 
round matches, a date with the 
Trojans is set. 

"USC is an enormous chal-
lenge," Boyle said. "Their level of 
play is so high." 

UCSD also hopes to have 
another opporrunity to play Long 
Beach State. After a wild 10-9 
triple-overtime loss against the 
4gers earlier this year at 
Canyon view Pool, the team 
would like some revenge. 

"I would love to play them 
again," Courtney Hemmerly said. 
"That last game lagainst Long 
Beach StateJ was so heartbreak-
ing. It would be great to get 
anolher shot at them." 

As the season winds to a close, 
the Tritons feel confident in their 
ability to claim the Women's 
\,Vater Polo Association 
Championship and a bid to the 
Final Four. 

"We've proven to be a team 
that can contend with the best 
reams in the nation," Hemmerly 
said. " 0 one should take us 
lightly." 

Boyle agreed, adding, "We're 
ready both physically and mental-
ly." 

spectacular defensive effort for 
the Tritons, posting 10 blocks. 
Jim Waller and Eric Perrine con-
tributed 17 and 13 kills, respec-
tively. 

BYU improved to 20-5 overall 
and 14-5 in the Mountain Pacific 
SportS Federation, and VCSD 
had its home game winning streak 
of three games snapped, and fell 
to 6-22 overall, 1-20 in league.

Women's tennis mettle shines bright 
in Xenia Anastasiadou tournament 
Only Barry University resists the Triton trident 
By COREY HOLMAN 
Staff Writer 

The UCSD women's tennis 
team has surprised many teams 
since moving to Division II last 
year, but after a good showing at 
the Xenia Anastasiadou 
Tournament last weekend, it will be 
hard for the Tritons to sneak up on 
anyone this year. 

)n the Pomona Calif., tourna-
ment, UCSD defeated No. 40 
Northern Colorado and No. 6 
Abilene Christian University, but 
came up short agajnst No.4 Barry 
U njversi ty. 

The Tritons opened with a nar-
row 5-4 win over Northern 
Colorado. UCSD started strong, 
winning two of the three doubles 
matches. 

Going into the si ngles matches, 
UCSD used its incredible depth as 
the catalyst for the team victory. No. 
4 Hung, No. 5 Jansen and No.6 
Westerman each cruised to their 
\vins. 

Though the outcome was 
already decided, the drama was 
saved for the top three si ngles 
matches. No. I Dao, after splitting 
the first two sets, dropped a first-
to-IO tiebreaker 2-10 and o. 2 
O'Neil lost 6- 10 in a tiebreaker. 
No. 3 Tadlock played the closest 
tiebreaker, evenrually falling 9- 11 
after opening 1-6, 6-4. 

The victory sent the Tritons 
into the winner's bracket with 
national power Barry University 
waiting in the wings. 

UCSl) gave the Miami-based 
Buccaneers a scare, bur in the end 
Barry'S talent was just too much and 
overcame UCSD 1)-3. 

The Tritons opened the match in 
lminspiring fashion for the first time 
this season, dropping all three dou-
bles marches. Tadlock and 
Westerman dropped only on break, 
losing 6-8 to Barry's Victoria 
Courmares and Maria Lopez, who 
are ranked No.6 in Division n dou-
bles. O'Neil and Hung lost 5-8 while

Continued from page 24 

The Tritons took that contiJence 
from their win into a game against 
Ilumboidt State University the next 
day. Harbn allowed oilly one rWl 
and five hits in four innings while 
she battled in a pitcher's duel with 
Chico State's Shona Guevara. 

VCSD didn't score until the bot-
rom of the eventh inning. After 
catcher Kristin Hunstad got the hit-
ting started, Martinelli followed with 
3 single of her own. Aggabao played 
the hero when her two-out, two-run 
hit gave the Tritons the 2-1 win. 

''It felt good to finally play like 
we had been playing at the begin-
ning of the season," Hunstad said. 

The Tritons next faced the 
Western Washington Umverslty 
Vikings - one of the stronger tcams 

Jansen and Dao dropped their first 
doubles match of the season 3-S. It 
was also the first 2002 lost for Jansen 
in either singles or doubles. 

Going into the singles, UCSD 
faced an uphill battle. Dao fell to 
Courmares, ranked as the No.5 sin-
gles player in the nation 6-0, 6-4. 
0' eil was on the wrong end of a 
straight-set decision against No. 17 
Gizella Turbock 6-2, 6-2, while 
Tadlock dropped her match against 
No. 44 Lopez 6-1, 6-1. 

The bonom three singles were 
different. Hung took her match in 
the tiebreaker 6-1, 3-6, 10-2. 
Jansen also got her come-from-
behind victory in a tiebreaker 3-6, 
6-3, 11-9. Westerman's victory was 
the only decisive point for the 
Tritons when she defeated her 
opponent 6-4, 6-1. 

"Even though we lost all three 
doubles, the girls rea lly played 
well ," said coach Liz LaPlante. 

The 6-3 decision was Barry's 
closest decision over a Division IT 
school all season including three 
other victories against top-10 
schools. 

The llitons then headed to the 
tournament's third-place game 
against Abilene Christian. 

Last year the Tritons dropped a 
5-2 decision to Abilene in the 16th 
round of the National Collegiate 
Athletic Association tournament. 
The Wildcats returned four of the 
six pbyers from that match, while 
the Tritons rerurned five. 

Revenge was served on a Sunday 
afternoon in Pomona with UCSO 
beating Abilene in an incredible 5-
4 comeback. 

UCSD continued its struggles in 
doubles from the day before, drop-
ping all three matches in close, hard-
fought decisions. Tadlock and 
Westerman came up a break short 6-
8 and the duos of O'NeillHung and 
Dao/]ansen each dropped 5-S 
matches. 

Dao, 0' eil and Tadlock each 
ended their personal three-game 
slcids with straight-set victories.

"The novice team did a great 
job," Phillipone said. "Their per-
formance showed a lot of promise 
for our program. We'll get another 
shot at OCC." 

The Triton men rounded out 
the Crew Classic with twO disap-
pointing finishes . In the open divi-

in the West Region. The game was 
close throughout, and after even 
innings the g.lme was tied I-I. 

WIth one out in the top of the 
eighth and a runner on third, the 
Vikinb'S attempted a squeeze play. 
TritOn third basem3n Amy Mettee 
sprang forward, grabbed the ball and 
appeared to put a t<tg on the WWV 
runner. However, the home plate 
umpire nlled that she hadn't tagged 
the runner and UC D lost 2-1. 

In UCSD's final game of the 
tournament, the UC Davis Aggies 
carne back from a three-run deficit 
to beat UCSD 5-3. The Triton 
runs were scored by tournament 
MVP Amy Rosson, who picked up 
a no-decision in the game after 
being knocked out in three innings. 
Joining Rosson on the AlI-
Tournament Team was UCSD left 
fielder Kristina Anderson . 

Despite the 2-3 record for the 
tournament, which fell short of 
what the team had hoped for, 
Triton head coach Patti Gerckens 

Dao has struggled at the o. I spot 
all season, compiling a 4-8 record, 
but she turned around with an 
impressive 7-5, 6-4 victory against 
Lacy Johnson, the No. 49 player in 
the nation. 

"IDa01 has had a difficult time at 
the No. I position, and that's some-
thing we talked about in the begin-
ning of the season," LaPlante said 
of the talented freshman. "We're 
hoping she gail s the experience 
and contidence so she will beat 
these players lat No. IJ ." 

In 2001, O'Neil lost a 4-6, 4-6 
decision to Sara Taweel in the 
NCAAs, but 2002 was a different 
story because O'Neil had few prob-
lems with Taweel, pulling out a 6-4, 
6-2 victory. Tadlock defeatecl 
Andrea Wildner, who defeated 
Tadlock's doubles partner 
Westerman in 2001, in a 6-2, 6-1 
match. 

Mary Hung, a singles winner 
against Abilene in 200 1, repeated her 
performance with an easy 6-2, 6-2 
victory. ow down 4-3, Abilene was 
in a hole with momenrum favoring 
the Tritons. Jansen lost a chance to 
clinch the match for the Tritons hy 
dropping the final two sets in a 6-4, 
3-6, 1-6 thriller. 

All eyes then focu ed on the No. 
6 Illatchup between two powerful 
bottom players. Tadlock entered 
the match with a 17-0 record while 
Abilenes freshman Summer 
Beasley came in with a 12-6 record, 
but was undefeated against non-
Division I opponents. Although the 
first set went to Beasley 3 -6, 
Tadlock, UCSD's lont: senior, 
evened the match with a 6-3 second 
set. The two players were even in 
the third set until a 7-4 tiebreak 
gave the third set to Ttldlock and 
the victory to the Tritons.

Christenson: academics and athletics work together 
By MATT RYAN 
Staff Wliter 

As senior Nick Christenson is 
about to embark on a new life out-
side college, he leaves behind a lega-
cy on and off the basketball court. 
Christenson is more than the MVP 
of the Triton basketball team - he 
is the epitome of the student athlete. 

Christenson came to VCSD four 
years ago not just to play basketball. 
but also because the school offered 
more than just athletics. 

"1 ('a me to UCSD because of the 
great reputation it has academical-
Iy," he said. "UCSD also gave me 
the best chance of playing college 
basketball, which was one of my 
goals coming out of high school." 

Christenson is an economics 
major and proved fie could succeed 
in class as well as on the court, 
receiving the Lee W. Gardner award 
his junior year for the best GPA on 
the team. 

Christenson racked up some

"When you take r that) into 
account 00' we actually did really 
well," Pinkerton said. 

However, Pinkerton also admit-
ted that she would have liked to see 
her team finish with slightly better 
times. 

"They rowed well , but even 
allowing for those things, I think we 
should have gone faster," she said. 

Nevertheless, overall they did 

impressive honors on the court as 
well. His junior and senior year, 
Christenson won both the MVP 
award and the Defensive Player of 
the Year.

upset ranks high on memory list. 

"extremely well," according to 
Pinkerton. 

Despite any disappointments 
from last weekend, women's crew 
has its eye on the ultimate prize of 
the year: a chance to compete in the 
National Collegiate Athletic 
Association Division n Nationals. 

Currently, UCSD is ranked third 
in the West bracket and fifth in the 
country in Division II. UC Davis 
and Western Washington, which 
t()(\k tirst and second, respectively, 
in the varsity open-eight race this 
weekend, are ranked first and third 
in the cO'Untry. 

"To go to the nationals, we're 
going to have to beat one of them," 
Pinkerton said. "Our goal is to be

Coach Greg Lanthier expounded 
on Christenson's value to the team. 

"Nick has done a wonderful job 
for us. He has provided us with sta-
bility in rough times," he said. "He 
is the kind of player that you tell 
other players to just do what Nick 
does. Practice and play the way he 
does." 

Christenson takes with him 
many great memorics, but a few 
stick out the most in his mind. 

"One memory that really sticks 
out for me is when we were still in 
Division III and we went to the 
Masters College in Santa Clarita 
and beat them on a last-second tip," 
he said. "The other would have to 
be when we upset Cal Poly Pomona 
last year." 

At 6-foot-2 and ISO Ibs., 
Christenson was not the tallest or 
the biggest guy on the court, but he 
was able to always play to the best of 
his abilities.

ranked second in the West, and then 
we could go to nationals." 

Despite appearances, UCSD's 
performance at the Crew Classic has 
Pinkerton thinking optimistically 
about the team's chances. 

WI think we'll improve," 
Pinkerton said. "The question is, 
will we improve enough?" 

The Pacific Coast Rowing 
Championships, the qualifying 
regatta for national competition, is 
in six weeks. 

"As a crew, we know we really 
have to make every stroke count," 
Pinkerton said .

For the third consecu tive 
year, the UCSD men's hockey 
team came home as tlle Pacitic 
Collegiatc Hockey Association 
champions with a triumphant 6-
J victory over rival Cal State 
Northridge Matadors on 
Sunday in Valencia, Calif. 

After beating the Matadors 
in an earlier round, as well as 
advancing past Cal State 
Northridge, Fresno State 
University and UC Davis in 
round-robin play, UCSD faced 
the team that handed thcm its 
only rwo PCHA league losses 
this season. 

"We gained valuable experi-
ence at our first-ever national 
tournament this year," said cap-
tain and defense man Garen 
Gervey of the team's earlier 
tournament. "As a result, our 
intensity levels were much hjgh-
er throughout this tournament 
than at any other four-game 
span during the season." 

UCSD managed to take a 1-
o lead in the battle. After the 
Matadors tied the game late in 
the first period, UCSD respond-
ed by scoring on the very next · 
shift. The second period ended 
with the Tritons ahead 5-2 and 
controlling play in the opposi-
tion's zone. 

However, as the final period 
began, the Tritons had a man in 
the penalty box. Despit~ 

UCSD's strong defensive work, 
the Matadors capitalized with a 
slap shot from the POlOt, bring-
ing the score to 5-3 . 

As the clock wound down , 
the physical play picked up from 
both sides. The u ·itol1S prevent-
ed the Matadors frolll getting 
any more scoring opportllllltle; 
with aggressive defense, and 
UCSD sealed the victory with 
an empty-net goal. 

"Every player on this team 
responded with a huge cffort 
and helped us come away with 
an amazing third-straight cham-
pionship," said goalie SCOtt 
Friedman. 

When the final buzzer 
sounded , the UCSD players 
spilled onto the ice to celebrate 
the win and their third conseclI-
tive PCHA championship. 

The team's championship 
came during it first season 
competing in the Anlcnc3n 
Collegiate Hockey Association 
as well as the PCHA. The move 
packed the team's sehedule with 
twice as many games. 

"Playing in two league and 
almost rwice as many games 
this year was tough for every-
one," said assistant coach Reid 
Hankins about why this cham-
pionship meant more LO the 
team. "Like a family, we had 
our trying moments with each 
other. But when it counted. we 
pulled together as a team and 
came up big. It's been a great 
year."

The UCSD women's varSIty open-eight 
boat finished tifth and the varSIty light-
weight-eight boat fil1lshed sixth thi~ week-
end at the San Diego Crew Classic, the 
team's first nationally ranked regatta of the 
season. 

The Crew Classic represented a change 
of pace for the team. Rather than having 
schools from every division comend openly 
in t~e open eight, Division II and Division 
III teams competed sepa rately from Division 
l. This is the first year the format has been 
used. 

According to oach Pattie Pinkerton, this 
change allowed UCSD to perform better 
than it has in past competitions with 
Division I school . 

"This was an opportunity for us to show 
well in the Crew Classic," she said . 

The varsity lightweight boat, as well as 
the junior varsity and novice boats, remained 
in open competitIon with schools in all divi-
sions. 

T he two-day competition began 

Sa turday when boats competed for bne 
placement and a chance to race 111 rhe finab 
Sunday. The varsity open-clgh t boat tin-
Ished fifth and the varsity-lightweight boat 
came 111 third behind Princeton UI1IVersltV 
and Queens College. . 

Sundav's races marked the Crew ClaSSIC 
finals. The lightweight boar ended 111 ~ixth 
place with a final time of 7:35 beh ind 
Wisconsin 111 first. The varSIty open eight 
tinished fifth in 7:4 1 for the second time that 
weekend, with UC Davis takmg first. 

According to Pinkerton, the weekend's 
only major letdown was that UCSD finished 
40 ~econds behind UC DaVIS in the varsity 
open competition. 

Yet Pinkerton pOll1ted out that UCSD's 
final Crew Classic standings fail to reveal the 
true prowess of the team. 

The arsity open-eight boat rowed with-
Out Amber Hopkins and Emily Gray. The 
varsity lightweight-eight boat was also hand-
icapped because the other boar rowing 
Sunday were from Division I schools. 

T he early-season regatta interrupted 
the young varsity team's traming, making

T he CSD softball team ended a long losing 
streak at the Tournament of Champions In 
,\ 'Iode to, Calif. , last weekend, but lost some 
clo e games en route to a 2-3 finish . 

T he Tritons had a seven-game losing streak 
into their first game of the tournament agam t 
conference foe Chico State University. Aher each 
team scored a first-inning run, the score remained 
knotted until the fifth inning when Chico State 
broke through with two runs off UCSD pitcher 
Christi Martinelli. Th~ Tritons could muster only 
seven hits against Chico State hurler Erin 
McCulloch.and dropped the game 1-3. 

UCSD came back later that day to play 
Charninade University of Honolulu in its second

from their losing streak, taking a 4-1 victory from 
the Silverswords. Leea Harlan 'got the win for the 
Tritons while Martinelli picked up the save. 
Despite previous tough times, shortstop Kim
