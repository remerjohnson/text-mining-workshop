Group will Help Implement ASUCSD 

Councils Form Government Transition Team 
by Laura Richter 

Staff Writer 
The four college councils met 

last Saturday to designate a 
transition team in hopes of 
facilitating the implementation of 
the newly elected student 
govenunent. 

College; Margo Chaney from 
Fourth College; Leslie Ct)le from

operative. "

The Associated Students UCSD (ASUCSD), like a phoenix risen from its 
ashes, has once again gained control of student government at UCSD. 

The ASUCSD victory was announced Saturday evening after com-
puter tallies gave it 51.7 percent of the student vote, with 1,269 votes cast 
in its favor. Fifty percent of the total vote was necessary to prevent a 
runoff between the top two vote getting governmental models. 

Coming in second was the Cabinet Assembly model with 786 votes, or 32 
percent of all ballots. The Student Cooperative Union, the " unofficial" 
student government, saw the end of what has often been termed a 
"stormy" 30 month reign, gaining only 16.3 percent of the vote on 400 
ballots. 

A strong turnout Friday, aided by lengthened polling hours, resulted in 
a total of 2,598 students :voting-close to 33 percent of the student body and 
well over the 25 percent figure set by the Elections Board of registered 
students needing to vote in order to make the election " legitimate." 

Ballots Ruled "Invalid" 
One hundred and forty three of 

the ballots were ruled " invalid," 
because in the words of Elections 
Board Coordinator Andy 
Schneider, " the people either 
chose not to vote, voted in-
correctly, or wrote messages on 
their ballots. ' 

Jeff Leifer, an actively involved 
ASUCSD partisan and Academic 
Senate Intern, termed the return of 
ASUCSD, out of power since 1972, 
as a "restoration of legitimacy for 
student government at UCSD." Jeff LeIfer 

Crediting the ASUCSD victory to a "hard knit" group of workers, the 
model's "reasonableness and responsiveness," and ' careful election 
strategy," Leifer noted the overwhelming popularity of the governmellt~! 
model. "Even if it had been necessary for a governmental nmoff, which it 
wasn't, we would have won convincingly," said Leifer. " Look at the 
figures (ASUCSD 1804-Coop 634 and ASUCSD 14M-Cabinet Assembly 
979), they tell the story." 

Leifer stated that he felt the election of the AS meant a " new begin-
ning," one wherein channels will again be opened"to tHe students , 
faculty , administration, and statewide support groups." 

"The gloom of the Coop will be gone," said Leifer emphatically. 
"Everyone, especially the students, will once again be able to identify 
with student politics at UCSD." 

Leifer was guarded in his statements concerning what he thought 
would happen in ASUCSD's immediate future, saying he wished to meet 
with " those who worked so hard in getting it(ASUCSD) instituted, , 
before he could get some idea of " upcoming proceedings." 

Referendum results were not yet 
available to the group at the noon 
gathering, but they continued to 
construct a plan on the premise 
that either the Cabinet-Assembly 
or the ASUCSD would replace the 
Coop. Said Mark Sindler, president 
of the Muir College council, "even 
if the Coop does win, there is still 
plenty for this group to do." 

One of the purposes of the 
meeting, according to Sindler, was 
to outline " the scope, definition 
and powers of the team, and the 
problems, conflicts and major 
issues with which it will have to 
deal." In examining the con-
tingencies of the three government 
forms, Carberry saw the duties of 
the team to be "working together 
for a short amount of time with the 
purpose of coordinating electio~, 
getting the ground work set up for 
position applications, and to 
prepare orientation and training 
materials for committee ap-
pointments and government 
members."

"This group neel:!!; and desires a

unanimously. They later appointed 
a team "to work with the college 
councils- we're not electing foW' 
people to sit on cloud nine," 
clarified Sindler.

Staff Writer 

Mark Mochary, a UCSD graduate student, may 
soon become a full voting member of the Board of the 
Regents of the University of California. 

The Regents will vote Friday to decide between 
Mochary tlnd two other applicants; Mike Salerno, a 
first year Davis law student, and David Levene, a 
second year Berkeley law student. The student 
chosen will become the third student regent to serve 
on the Regents since the pol'ition began. 

The stUdent regent's post was created in 1974. Each 
tenn Is for one year and the student has full Regent 
powers, including voting on aU issues, introducing 
motions, and serving on committees. 

In an interview with the Triton Times, Mochary 
said his aim as student regent would be " presenting 
what I see as the student perspective." He became 
interested in the position because of a lot of things 
affecting the students here (UCSD), both un-
dergraduate and graduates, are shared by students 
system wide." Mochary has been active in graduate 
student govenunent at UCSD, serving as the 
graduate student intern and the Anthropology 
~ Department representative to the Graduate Stud nt 
t Council. 

Mochary talked about a number of specific is u ' 
he would pursue as the student regent. Affirmativ 
action, student-.rated business on campus, and th 

level of graduate and undergraduate education were 
among those things mentioned promin ntly. 

Affirmative Action 
Mochary sees the affirmative action topic as 

"one of the most important issues we face in this 
country. The University needs to be more accessible 
to minorities at all levels ; student, faculty, and ad-
ministrative. 

"I would hope the Board could take the lead in 
pushing towards an entirely different set of ad-
missions standards. There is a need for more em-
phasis on subjective criteria for evaluation." Among 
the subjective criteria he listed are teacher 
evaluations, community work, compassion, and 
empathy. 

" It 's not a matter of lowering academic standards 
but one of r cognizin that t 1ere is no such thing as a 
culturally fr , racially n u :ral, standardized te t ," 
said Mochary. 

On the subject of the quality of Wldergraduate 
education , Mochary oust! I· ~ lllaL " LI U 811l-

Graduate tudent Council Report 

T A. 5 ortage to Worsen in Fall '77 
The current stwrtage of TAs is 

scheduled to become worse next 
year. The result will be severe 
cutbacks in the number of 
available sections and further 
overcrowding in the remaining 
sections. 

The non-tlCience departments 
wtll be hardest hit. Overall, the 
effect will be to further degrade 
undergraduate education at UCSD 

. and to disrupt the supply of TA jobs 
through which many graduate 
students support themselves. 
Departments will be forced to 
reduce the number of year-long job 
contracts signed in advance. UCSD 
will be able to recruit fewer 
graduate students and programs 
will suffer. 

The Graduate Student CoWlcil 
(GSC) has pieced together this 
report directly from 
Administration planning and 
budget documents, the TAlWork 
Study ':.ask Force report, the T A 

allo~tion plan, and conferences 
with members of the 
Admini stration . T,he 

Administration has been con-
fronted with the figures in this 
report and does not challenge their 
accuracy. There is little question 
that the outlook for education at 
UCSD next year is unacceptably 
bleak. 

The total number of the TA F ull 
Time Equivalents (FTE) for this 
year is 178.22, with 148.2 state 
funded and 30.02 from other 
sources. (Each FTE pays the 
wages of 2 T'As at 50 percent 
time.) The Chancellor's "Teaching 
Assistant/Work Study" Task 
Force, which included no students , 
calculates that an increase to 187 
TA FTE is required for next year 
just to maintain the current overall 

UG :TA ratio, since there will be 
IDcreased UG Enrollment, in-
cluding a deliberate 
overenrolbnent of 200 UG. 

To date the Administration has 
commltted funding for only 170 
total TA Fl'E, with 156.2 state 
funded and 13.8 from other SOID'-
ces. Thus, next year the total 
number of TA FTE will be 8.22 less 
and there will be a 17 T A FTE 
shortage overall. The shortage 
would be even greater if calculated 
on the basis of the nmnber of TA 
FTE required for top-quality 
Wldergraduate education. 

The Task Force reports that 
each TA FTE covers 12 discussion 
sections, thus there will be a 204 
section shortage next year. The 
sections which remain will 
necessarily be even further 
overcrowded than now . The 
Administration has stated it hopes 
graduate students won't object, 
since no currently employed T' As 
will be forced out of their jobs. The 
8.22 TA FTE drop in total FTE 
would be made up for jobs vacated 
by graduation. 

Of course, this means that the 
continuing T'As will face even 
larger section sizes and that 
qualified incoming graduate 
students will be denied necessary 
employment. The number of In-
coming graduate students would 
have to be reduced to maintain 
current funding levels. There will 
obviously be a severe disruptive 
effect on graduate programs and 
graduate student recruitment. 

To make matters worse, the 
proposed TA FTE allocation plan 
calls for releasing only 153 of next 
year's TA FTE on 1 April, 1977, 
with the remaining 17 FTE held 
until the fifth week 0( the winter 
(1978) quarter. Thus, there will

actually be a 3f FTE shortage unW 
well Into next year. Departments 
wru generally be unable to fulfill 
their conunitment for year-long 
job contracts signed in advance. 
This late allocation procedure may 
also force T As out of their jobs, 
despite the Administration 
assurances to the contrary . 

The deleterious effects al the T A 
shortage will not be felt equally in 
all departments. Laboratory 
courses, along with the Writing and 
Revelle Humanities Programs, 
have first priority for T A staffing. 
Most graduate students in the 
sciences support themselves by 
employment as research 

. assistants, with only a small ad-
mixture of TA jobs. These two 
staffing patterns indicate the non-
science departments will be 
hardest hit. 

The situation will be further 
exacerbated because the 
Administration intends to slash the 
TA FTE allocations of ?ll percent 
or more to certain non-science 
departments, claiming a lack of 
interested undergraduates. These 
departments are literature, 
philosophy, visual arts, and music. 
One must wonder whether the 
current TA shortage, which has 
led to fewer available sections and 
less personal attention, has the 
effect of driving undergraduates 
away from those subject areas 
which require smaller class sizes 
for effective education. . 

The above information is In-
tended to warn students of the 
continued degrading of education 
at UO>D. Part n of this report will 
explore the causes, both historic 
and current, of the problem along 
with the Administration's modest 
proposals to deal with it. Part III 
will contain specific proposals and 
rationale for co~ructively solving 
the problem.

YSA Commentary 

Chicana Rights 
Chicanas are among the hardest 

hit by the current attacks on 
women's rights. The American 
educational system turns 
knowledge of another language, 
such as Spanish, into a disad-
vantage when it should be an ad-
vantage. Racist discrimination In 
hiring and firing practices forces 
Chicanas into the least skilled and 
worst paying Jobs. The median 
income of a Chicana is $2,6112 a 
year. 

Inadequate birth control in-
fonnation and inavailabllity of 
contraceptives, coupled with the 
difficulty in obtaining abortions is 
an added burden. Not to mention 
the "solution" offered by racist 
doctors-forced sterilization. 

Within the Chicano movement 
there are various views concerning 
Oticanas' participation in the 
general feminist movement. 

Why Should 
A Good Prof 
Lose Position? 
To : Chairperson of the Depart-
ment of Sociology. 

It was a great shock to me to 
learn that Professor Ngubo's 
contract has not been renewed, 
(Triton'l1mes March 2,1977.) 

During my almost three years as 
a sociology student at UCSD I have 
taken courses from Prof. Ngubo,. 
and I ~ave found him to be a great 
teacher and an inspiration to his 
students, He is helpful, never 
arrogant or condescending, and is 
always available for assistance or 
discussions, inside or outside of 
office hours. 

It is a well-known fact that the 
emphasis at UCSD is on 
publishing . This is understandable 
for an institution that aspires to 
academic excellence, but the 
University is doing its students and 
the people of California a disser-
vice by not valuing the gift fi 
teaching equally highly. 

One objection that is raised is 
that Chicanas should not devote 
energy to their own particular 
strugles as women until the 
problems of the Chicano people as 
a whole have been solved . 
Otherwise, they argue, while 
Chicanas are organizing for their 
own rights, the movement will 
have less people working for its 
goals, and will be set back. 

The problems confronting 
Chicanas are problems of concern 
to the Chicano community as a 
whole. The Chicano movement 
must take up .the demands of 
women strugglirig for equality. 
That is the only way that the 
movement will fight for the needs 
of all alla Raza. 

Another argument that is raised 
more often is that because equality 
for women Is a goal of the chicano 
movement as a whole, Chicanas 
don't need to organize against their 
oppression as women. Some who 
caD themselves socialists add that 
the feminist movement is a "white, 
middle-class movement" that 
doesn 't address itself to the 
question of which class will rule 
society, the capitalists or the 
workers . 

It is true that a workers' 
government would greatly benefit 
Chicanas. At the same time, 
however, any movement that 
fights for the equality of an op-
pressed layer of American society 
challenges the very basis of the 
capitalist system. That's because 
th.is society-a society based on 
profit instead of human needs-

Literary Critic-Warns 
Of Cultural· Erosion 

by Joel C. Don 
AIIodate NeWI EdItor 

Dwight MacDonald, writer, 
scholar and literary critic, warned 
of the erosion of American culture 
here Thursday due to a lack of 

' concern for art, history, and 
literature and the popularity of 
television and other "imitations" 
of culture. 

MacDonald's theory of culture is 
based on a hierarchy of what he 
terms "high" culture, dominated 
by a small percentage al elite 

scholars in society, and "mass" 
culture, the basis of the majority of 
society. 

MacDonald explained that mass 
culture lacks " taste and 
sophistication" and is " pre-
digested and assigned for easy 
digestion. " 

Admitting to the elitist nature of 
his sociological theory, MacDonald 
said "let the masses have their fun 
and let us have our fun." He fur-
ther elucidated upon this point 
saying tha t artists and in-
tellectuals don't "stick together, " 
They should not fear being iden-
tified with an "ivory tower," the 
term art for art's sake and being 
called snobs. .• 

"I don' t see what's wrong with 
art for art's sake," he said, adding 
that "art is a useless thing-it 
makes man better, but in a ttif-
feIJ!nt way." 

MacDonl\ld, 71 , a Regents' 
lecturer in the Department of 
Literature since mid-February, is 
noted for his work as publisher and 
chief contributor to Politics from 
1944-1949 and, more recently, his 
position as a film critic for EIqaire 
(1960-1966). 

The increase in the number of 
students in the 'unislersities has 
nr • ..m.NOIi a "peculiar hybrid" of 

culture, MacDonald said. He 
identified "mid" culture as an 
"unnatural intercourse between 
high and mass culture which 
threatens to absorb its parents. 

Mid culture has all the qualities 
of high culture but covers them 
over with a cultural fig leaf and 
Ignores the values of high culture," 
he said. 

MacDonald .criticized today's 
student, whom he believes lacks 
the initiative to pursue education 
beyond " required" reading. 

Two possible solutions to the 
problem include an attempt to 
include everyone in one culture or 
increase the idea of two distinct 
and separate cultures. MacDona ld 

, asserted that everyone "should 
have a chance to experie~ce 
culture," but no one should be 
"cajoled to do it. " 

" It is the duty as well as the right 
. of the citizens to participate in the 
culture," MacDonald said,

Q; 
E 
~ 

by Dr. Littleluan 
WE GET LETTERS .... 

Dear Doc: I wonder If you know 
the arrogant Image you are giving 
off In your column. You sometimell 
give off tbe blp, straight 8Dswen, 
but mostly It 's stupid nonsense. An 
example-your last column. You 
were asked for good AM stations, 
sometbing a lot of people would 
like to know, and you responded 
the guy sbould buy a tape deck. 
Wby don't you buy him one, you 
jerk? 

Dear Doc: Hey, I thougbt that 
answer II great for Frustrated wbo 
needed to find a good AM radio 
station. You told hlm/ber to buy a 
tape player. Heilig a native San 
Dlegan, I know that a good AM 
station doesn't exist. Let's face It-If 
It doesn't exist, It doesn't exist, and 
buying a tape player Is a lot 

eheaper tban buying a radio 
station, right? 

Right. 
Dear Doc: What song, made 

popular by Unda Ronstadt, was 
originally written by one of the 
Monkees? 

The song is "Different Drum" 
written by Monkee Mike Nesmith, 
and made popular by Ronstadt 
during her Stone Pony days. 

, 

Dear Doc: What Is the opposite 
of progress? 

Well, since the opposite of pro is 
con, the opposite of progress must 
be Congress. 

Dear Doc: Why do faculty and 
staff get preferential parking over 
students? If students are willing to 
pay for an "A" permit, wby can't 
they get them? Is faculty/staff 
power so strong all to keep students 
out of the good parking spots? 
What are the "official" and 
" unofficial" reasons for the 
preferential porklng? Slgned·Tlred 
of Walking From The Overflow Lot 
at Muir. 

Back in 1964 then-Chancellor 
York created the "A," "B," and 
"S" permit catagories because 
everyone wanted preferential 
parking and some mechanism had 
to be set up to determine who could 
park where. His action was in 
support of pressure being brought 
by the Academic Senate to give 
faculty preferential parking . 
However, it was not until 1970 that 
the differential fee came into 
being. This was a result of students 
complaining that staff and faculty 
were not paying a premium for the 
privilege of parking in the best 
spaces. 

The system of preferential 
parking we have now is based on 
price. If students were allowed to 
buy whatever permit they wanted, 
the number of "A" and "B" spaces 
would have to be increased.

According to one Parking Services 
official, eventually this would 
result in a loss of status for the "A" 
spaces and another system would 
have to be developed to determine 
who can park in the closest spaces. 

While students may argue that 
whomever . gets to campus first 
should be able to park the closest 
and in the best spaces, studies by 
the Parking Advisory Committee 
show that since faculty don't stay 
on campus very long each day, the 
oversell rate on " A" permits can 
be quite high. If students could 
park in " A" spaces, the argument 
goes, they would use them for 
longer periods of time and the 
overall number of drivers using the 
space would be reduced . 
Presently, 938 " A" permits are 
sold for 552 spaces. By way of 
contrast, 3924 "S" permits are sold 
for 3949 spaces. Since the holder of 
an "S" permit has no alternative 
but to park in an "s" space, it 
would be impossible to have two-to-
one oversell ratio of "S" permits. 

"A" pennits were originally 
deSignated for any academic 
appointee, and any senior staff 
member earning over a 
predetermined salary level. Then, 
administrators involved with 
management of the University 
were added to this list. Finally, the 
Parking Advisory Committee 
decided to add certain staff 
positions, such as Police Chief, that 
were deemed key to the Univer· 
sity. 

Although officially un· 
dergraduates can only have "S" 
permits, regardless of whether or 
not they are employed on campus, 
there are ways around this. Since 
1968, any student who is hired as a 
Resident Advisor is entitled to buy 
a "B" permit. In addition, many 
students convinc their employers 
on campus to issue them an em· 
ployee 10 card which enables them 
to buy a "B" permit. 

As th situatiQn stands now, it 

would take an action by the 
Parking Advisory Committee to 
change the present policies. 
Students interested in doing so 
should t:ontact Steve Colman, a 
student representative on the 
committee. However, remember 
that the original situation came 
about because faculty have a 
louder voice than students. They 
have already begun asking for 
tighter restrictions on the 
preferential spaces because, they 
claim, too many people who don't 
belong in the "A" spaces are being 
allowed to park there. 

Dear Doc: Who controls the 
money received ' from UCSD 
parking meters and what use Is It 
put to? 

All revenue from permit sales 
and meters goes to Parking Ser· 
vices and is used to pay the 
operating costs of tbe parking 
system here. 

Dear Doc: What is the ratio of 
men to women at UCSD? At 
Revelle? Muir? Third? Fourth? 
Med School? SIO? 

Contra ry to rumors circulating 
about 5·1 and 7·1 ratios of men to 
women on this campus, the un-
dergraduate ratio is 1.338·1.000. 
This is broken down by colleges as 
follows : Revelle : 1.650-1.000; 
Muir : 1.085-1.000; Third : 1.27.7· 
1.000 ; Fourth : 1.553·1.000' Med 
School: 4.705-1.000; SIO: 6.160-
1.000; Other Grads: 2.441·1.000. 
The graduate ratio of 2.993-1.000 
brings th total campus ratio up to 
1.524·1.000. Aren't numbers 
wonderful?

depends on inequality for Its very 
existence. 

The women's movement 
challenges that basis. The 
demands of the women's 
movement are based on Issues that 
are of burning importance to \a 
Chicana, as well as other women 
who face double oppression and 
exploitation. 

The Young Socialist Alliance will 
present a forum on "Feminism and 
Sociallam" Tuesday, at 1 pOi liilfle 
Student Center's North conference 
room. Olga Rodriguez, a member 
of the National CommIttee of the 
Socialist Workers Party, will 
discuss some of the problems 
facing Chicanas. Ms. Rodriguez Is 
a longtime activist in the feminist 
and Oticano movementJI. She ran 
against Brown In the 1974 guber· 
natorial race In CaUfornia.

chancellor and Dean of Student 
Affairs George Murphy had frozen 
Student Activity Fee (SAF ) funds . 
Said Kate Sullivan, SAF Support 
Group, " The possibility of Murphy 
freezing funds is a very real one, as 
he has the power to do it any time. I 
can see him doing it out of con-
fusion or malice or whatever." 
Andy Schneider of Muir saw this 
freezing of funds as "the exact 
thing that we're hoping the tran-
sition team would prevent, in that 
people like McElroy and Murphy 
would recognize the legitimacy of 
our group. " 

Murphy was unavailable for 
confirmation of this report during 
the meeting, according to Car-

While 1ft stili free.

"It's easy. Once you

"I had C's in high school. After

Richard St. Laurent,

berry, who made the phone call. 
The alleged move by Murphy 
prompted Sindler to declare "I do 
not wish to abdicate our respon-
sibilities to the students. I do not 
want to see us lose our momen-
tum." 

Future of Support Groups 
In demonstrating the seriousness 

of the future of the various support 
groups, Sindler presented a letter, 
addressed to him and written by 
Kevin Cahill of Appointments and 
Evaluations (A and E ). The letter 
expressed Cahill's concern about 
the status of A and E in relation to 

-the transition and implementation 
of a new government. He saw the 
continuation of the group as " in-
dispensible in order for A and E 's 
status to be official with relation to 
the Academic Senate." Cahill also 
suggested that members of the 
committee be held on as an interim 
body. 

The election of the new gover-
nment members was discussed. In 
reference to the referendum held 
last week, Sedonia Charlot of Third 
College revealed that "I saw a lot 
of people make a concerted effort 
to make sure elections didn't 
happen, and I think they did a 
damn good job of it." She felt that 
it was the council's responsibility 
to "get people aware" so that there 
will be " no excuse" during the 
elections next quarter. 

The group tentatively agreed 
that elections for the new govern-
ment offices should take place 
during the third week of Spring 
quarter.
