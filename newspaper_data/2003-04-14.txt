Brown's veto overturned 
Expansion referendum supported by council 

By MARNETTE FEDERIS 
Senior Staff Writer 

Thc A.S. Council voted 17 -4-0 
at its April 9 meeti ng to override 
A.s. President Jenn Brown' veto 
on the refe rendum presented by 
the University Centers Expansion 
Task Force. 

The vote came after Brown 
vetoed legislation to pass the ref-
erendum produced by UCETF 
that calls for a $39-per-quarter fee 
for the expansion and renovation 
of the Price Center anti the 
Student Center. 

"[ think that it [the vote to 
override the veto] was perfectly 
legitimate and the senators were 
upholding their jobs," said 
UCETF Chair Garo Bournoutian. 

Before the first roll call vote, 
Brown pre emed another version 
of the referendum, which would 
have changed the overseeing of 
construction, planning and design 
to the A.S . Council and the 
Graduate Students Association. 

"The implications of these 
changes would be huge with 

rcgard~ to 
student control," Brown said. 
"TIle building would still be built 
on time, with all of the promised 
parts. The only difference would be 
that students would have the final 
ay in decision making." 

Argumcnts against thc UCETF 
recommended referendum were 
brought up in the last two weeks 
regarding autonomy of the project. 

"[ don'r think we should have 
overturned the veto," said Revelle 

Ollege Senior enator Amy 
Uye~hima. "Jenn Brown has dif-

ferent opinions from the majority 
of other council members and 1 
think it's an important qua lity 
because she represents voices that 
are not heing heard on campus," 

Many of the council members 
also expre sed concerns about the 
Implications of student autonomy 
and on whether the referendum 
will pass as presented by the task 
force. 

"I'm not sure if A.S. ca n handle 
that," Uyeshima said. "1n terms of 
the expansion, which has been an 
ongoing thing at our university, it 
seems that we are in a desperate 
situation to pass the referendum 
this year and I'm worried about 
seeing it fail." 

Brown's proposal was to have a 
Building Advisory Committee co-
chaired by two students and made 
up of students appoi nted by the 
A.S. Counci l and GSA. 

However, according to 
Bournourian, university policies 
prevent any Building Advisory 
Committee to be entirely com-
pri cd of students. 

"Any Building Advisory 
Committee necd to have voting 
mcmbers that are not students," 
Bournoutian aid. 

Commissioner of Snldent 
Advocacy Brie Finegold also pre-
sented amendmcnts to the 
UCETF referendum. Council 
member have expressed their 
concerns a bou t not a ki ng Stu-
dents whether autOnomy is desired 
on campus. Finegold's proposed 
changes would have called for Stu-
dents to vote on who they would 
like to control the expanded and 
renovated tudent centers. 

I [owever, after discussions on 
the amendment and possibilities of 
a Bui lding Advisory Committee 
made up of only students, the 
counci l moved to vote on the 
UCETF version. 

Some council members such as 
John Muir College Sophomore 
Senator Jeremy Cogan abstained 
during the first roll call vote, but 
changed his vote for the UCETF 
referendum. 

"The last time 1 felt there wasn't 
sufficient discussion on the differ-
ent versions of the referendum," 
Cogan said. "After hearing all sides 
of the story, I felt that the original 
plan was the best way to go." 

With the referendum approved 
by the A.S. Council, the UCETF 
will now focus its attention toward 
publicizing and getting students to 
vote. The task force's main goal 
now is to inform students abom the 
referendum and the reasons each 
item in the referendum is present. 

[t also plans to increase mem-
bership to include representatives 
from student organizations such 
a the Student Affirmative Action 
Committee, Student Initiated 
Outreach and Recruitment 
Commission, and Pan-Hellenic 
Council as well as others. 
Repre entative from the six col-
leges will also be extended mem-
bership into the new task force . 

"The focus of the task force IS 
Simply getting people to vote for 
the campaign,'" said James Lynch, 
UCAB Chair and represenraove 
for the UCETF. "It \vill be to 
inform what's at stake, encourage 
[students] to vote and to let them 
make their own decisions."

Foods, performances abound 
at 25th annual celebration 

By LAUREN FERRIS 
Staff Writer 

The 25th annual cultural cele-
bration was held by the Leadership 
Committee for Cultural 
Connections on April 12 . The 
event featured culture booths 
offering ethnic food, dancing and 
music and coincided with UCSD's 
Admit Day, allowing both the 
UCSD community and prospective 
students to attend. 

"The food is probably the 
biggest attraction here," said 

-nlUrgood i\lar~hall College Junior 
Kim ,\larino. "It's the only time 
when you can come to one spot to 
get all kinds of food that you would 
have to dnve all over San Diego to 
get nornully." 

Campus and community organi-

for the final two days of campaigrung. 
hortly after the origlOal poster were 

taken down, new posters replaced them. 
The new Students First! po rers were 
nearly Identical to the original poster - It 
seems likely, 10 fact, that they were the 
same posters that had just been taken down 
- but now had "APSA endorses" wrinen 
on them. At least orne of the posters were 
hung by Sl\lden with known ties to the 
Studen ts First! slate, including Damel 
Gonzales, who argued the Srudents Flml 
case In the ong1nal grievance hearing. 
Clearly, further \10latiOns had occurred. 

Afrer Srudents First' defied the previ-
ous ruling, A. . Elections Manager 
Robin helton and the elections commit-
tee were forced to make a choice between 
not pUnishing the slate at all or dlsquali-
fymg them. ince Srudents Flrstl broke 
Monday's decree of the e1ecuons com-
mmee, they were properly PUfll hed With 
disqualifica tions. 

As the Incident took place at the end of 
the campaigning penod and the gnevance 
wasn 'r heard until after voting had ended, 
the only punishment that could have been 
·Ieveled by the elections committee, if it 
found the slate guilty, was to disqualify 
them. orne may argue that the commit-
tee did not have to disqualify the entire 
slate, and only those who could be proven 
to have paniclpated 10 the poster-hang-
ing; but the members of the slate Signed a 
contract at the start of the e1eccon penod 
malong the enore slate accountable for 
the actions of indiVIduals on the slate. 
After the elections comminee found that 
Srudents First' had Violated the origmal 
comnunee ruling, It had no chOice but to 
disqualify the entire slate. Ilad the viola-
tion occurred earher 10 the week, then a 
fitting purushment perhaps would have 
been to suspend all carnpaJglllng PriVI-
leges for the slate, but as dungs stood on 
Friday, It was rusquallfication or a taCIt 
endorsement of dirty campaignmg. 

The sad fact of the situation wa~ that 
Srudents FIrSt 1 almost cerumly did not 
need to hang the new poster~ . Students 
Flrstl's election ranic has long been 
courung on student orgalllzauon~ for 
votes, and these votes come not from 

poster~ but from skillful coalition-bUild· 
mg. Ke\1n Shawn Ii su won the preslden· 
tJal race by 64 votes BarISh andagopal 

took the \1ce pre ident finance spot by 
nearly 1,000 votes. Moneek Bhatia only 
lost the vice preSident internal race by 41 
votes. Had the slate simply refocused 
efforts on personal campaigning instead 
of trymg to find a way around the elec-
tions committee's ruling, then those mar-
gins most bkely would have stayed the 
same, or even increased. in retrospect, 
the deciSion to hang posrers up after the 
Wednesday deadline was foolish . In real -
Ity, It did little to help the candidates, but 
ended up cosong many the election. 

As bad as it is, these practices are 
indicative of the way slate politics has 
influenced UCSD pohtics. That Students 
Firstl felt itself so untouchable as to 
directly challenge a ruling of the elections 
COlllmmee show a wm-at-all-costs men-
tab ty that is ever-present In campus elec-
oons. Perhaps thIS recent disquahfication 
will erve as a wake-up call to those look-
Ing to run for offi ce next year. Slates have 
long shown themselves to be breedmg 
grounds for behaVior that IS detrunenral 
to the quality of student life ~ t UCSD 
Candidates become so ob~essed With lOC-

ing the party line and trying to get an 
entire slate elected that they forget to 
address the issues that their particular 
po ioon faces. By not concentrating on 
specific ISSUes, many candidates 10 e sight 
of what should be the ultimate goal : doing 
their job to the best of their ability to 
improve student life. Ths was a harsh les-
son, but it may end up being one that will 
educate future candidates. 

Another shocking 3.nd sad twist to the 
Students Firstl drama that has played out 
at UCSD over the past week was the party 
reaction to the election results on Friday 
night. After it was announced that the 
Srudents Firstl slate was disqualified, those 
In the Students First! camp proceeded to 
shout ohsceruoes and curses before throw-
ing ch3lrs whIle storming out of UCSDs 
Round Table Piua, where the results were 
being read. Once out, tho e In the 
Students First! party COntlOUed to shout 
thing back into Round Table. ne mem-
ber of the tudents First

' 
party was heard 

shouong, "Talce your fucking wlme pnVl-
lege and km Illy assl" Other hOUlS mclud-
ed "fucking raCist bastards" and "keeping 

the people of color down." Making race an 
issue in the decision was com pletely 
uncalled for. The bonom line was that the 
slate violated bylaws - twice. They should 
be accountable for those actions, no maner 
what color their skin is. This is definitely 
not the conduct of someone worthy of 
holding an elected position. At the very 
least, the members of the slate should con-
duct themselves in an appropriate manner 
instead of throwing a tantrum that mOst 
would equate with a spoiled chi ld. 

One person who has been outspoken 
on the elections this year has been A.S. 
PresidentJenn Brown. At last wedc's A.S. 
Council meeting, Brown congratulated 
Thurgood Marshall College Junior 
Senator Jeff Le for his work on the elec-
tions comminee. Brown took it a step fur-
ther by apologizing for not appointing him 
elections manager. Ths was a slap in the 
face of current Elections Manager Robin 
Shelton, who has been a faithful execllter 
of elections bylaws this year. Brown's state-
ment howed JUSt how political and self-
serving she can be: Le dis ented in. the 
original Students First! decision , and 
Brown's ties to Students Fir t! are well 
known. When she first appointed Shelton 
to the position of elections manager, 

helton made it clear that he would adhere 
to the bylaw and be fair. Brown endor ed 
him with those thoughts in mind. ow 
that Shelton and his comrrunce have done 
exactly that and tuled against Browns for-
mer slate, she is speaking out against him. 
By her conduct, it would seem that Brown 
is only interested m following the rules 
when they benefit her or her party. 

Throughout the mess that has been 
this year's A.S. election, Shelton has done 
a great job in keeping relative order and 
taking care to faithfully execute the elec-
tions bylaws. In an election marred by 
dirty politics and baseless accusations, it is 
nice to know that somebody stood by their 
po ition and finaIJy executed the bylaws 
the way they were wrinen. Shelton has 
held back on reading too much into the 
bylaws to make sweeping decisions based 
on personal politics. All of the committees 
decisions have been firmly rooted in the 
text of the bylaws. This is the first time in 
a while that the elections manager has 
taken such an approach to the elections 
season. It was a refreshing change that will 
hopefully spill over into elections to come. 

While it is sad that there are current-
ly several empty seats in the council and 
some candidates in office who did not 
receive the most votes, it is more Impor-
tant to maintain the integrity of the elec-
tions. Those who argue that the students' 
voices shquld be heard at the expense of 
the strict enforcement of the bylaws are 
arguing to throw the rules out the win-
dow. Contrary to seemingly popular 
belief, rules were not made to be broken 
or manipulated. The rules were set up to 
ensure that everyone has a fair chance to 
run for office. When people deliberately 
break those rules to gain an advantage, 
then they hould be punished. If that 
punishment has to be disqualification, 
then that I~ the price that they must pay 
for not plaYing by the rules. 

Democracy IS a very Important concept 
and an Ideal to be stTIved rowanl at th, ~ 
school, but not at the expen e of the rule!. .

Spring break spent dreaming 
pe~'s-eye 

view 
Sam Wilson 

I don't know where my time goes anymore. Over spring break, I was dividing my time 
evenly between watching CNN 
and trying not to. Television, long 
a trusted distractor, had betrayed 
me. Fox had a new dating show 
called "In Bed With Reporters," 
which attatched a live reporter to a 
new couple, and only paid the cam-
era crew if they gOt to third base. 

Turning to the computer for 
solace, r joined an online gamc of 
Counterstrike, determined to drift 
away on a high tide of easy "frags." 
To my horror, I discovered that the 
host had changed the rules of the 
game, allowing the terrorist side to 
dress up as one of the many civilians 
who now littered the game map. 

After vainly shreddi ng dozens 
of empty thoub , r soon learned 
that RPG didn't only mean "role 
playing game" (fun fact : a 
"thoub", also called a "Dish-dash-
ah" is the long-sleeved one· piece 
garment often worn by men in 
Arab countries). It allows air to 
circulate easily, cooling the body. 

Confident that my urban-war-
fare training simulation had been 
succesful for the evening, [ signed 
on to Instant Messager to prowl for 
pity sex. Multitasking like a mo-fo, 
I hooked up the stock ticker to 
check on my shares of Carlyle 
Group, a hot-as-walnuts Strategic 
Consulting firm headed by Bush r. 

Much to my chagrin, all mar-
kets had been shut down, and 
in tcad of companies, the names of 
Bmish, American, and Iraqi dead

scrolled past, in silent memorial. 
At this point, I realized that I 

was obviously dreaming. I mean, 
if we succumb to fear and change 
our lifestyle in even the smallest 
way, that means that the French 
have won. 

lt was then that a beautiful 
woman appeared to me, only her 
head fully visible, and the rest of her 
body covered in thin translucent 
jelly, flecked with organelles like 
poppy-seed on a bagel. [ couldn't 
help but hope that this would be 
another episode in my ongoing 
series of tantalizingly Freudian 
birth-reenaconent dreams. 

"I was supposed to be wearing a 
burka," she said to me, "since 
dreams, like daytime talk shows, are 
most memorable when they peak 
in the language of stereotypes." 

"But in my mind it became a 
bursa, a membranous pouch," I 
continued, reading her thoughts. 
"Because I just had a biology final. 
Cruel, twisted fate .. . " 

We drew nearer, as if to kiss. 
She whispered in my ear "rhinoc-
eros gumball," and slipped a small 
piece of paper into my open hand. 

T awoke in the late afternoon 
sun hine, holding a glossy flyer. 
that read "Corne To Las Vegas: 
City of The Future." I didn't need 
much convincing. Hours later, I 
was speeding through the evada 
desert, inventing racial slurs in the 
backseat of a Volvo. 

Valet all the way, we made our 
entrance to the casino floor. Our 
first stop was the seafood buffet for 
some Nevada crab legs and raw 
oysters jello shots, but nobody 
like a party-killer. Soon we were 
back on the road, headed for the 
Hospitalencia. 

The Hospitalencia, in the heart 
of The Strip, is a three-star 
hotel/casino, non-accredited med-

TIckets available at the

ical school , and emergency clinic 
all rolled into one. Where else can 
you get your child's vaccinations 
camped while you shake hands 
with the one-armed man? My 
friends and I walked into the E.R. 
and pulled up a few chairs at the 
waiting room Let It Ride table. 
Before even looking to my right, I 
knew from the smell of chewed tin 
and regurgitated sagebrush that I 
had accidenta lly sat next to my 
scapegoat, again. Let me explain. 

Fun fact: when ancient Israelis 
would sacrifice a goat to absolve 
them of their sins, they would also 
anoint a second goat with the 
same confessions, branding that 
goat and setting it free to roam the 
countryside. Sometimes the goat 
would wander back, reminding 
their former owner that their sins 
could never be forgonen com-
pletely, only to be banished once 
Illore to the wilderness. 

Slowly turning my head and 
seeing the Strucrure logo burned 
into the goat's left cheek, r saw 
that it was true. "Well, this is awk-
ward," I said. "How's catch and 
release treating you?" 

"Oh, fine," he snarled. "How 
is it to be absolved of the chain 
link incident?" 

"You know, I've got a fwmy story 
about that. See, the other day, I was 
at the mall watching the girls in the 
ice rink and I saw this one girl that 
couldn't have been more than ... " 

"This is really fucking up my 
buzz," bleated the thorny goat, as 
he walked away into the crowd of 
EMTs and cocktail waitresses . "If 
I run and find you a new sacrifice, 
do you promise to shut up?" 

That's when I realized every-
thing was gonna be a-okay. When 
your scapegoats start doing the 
work for you, all you have to do is 
sit back and let it ride. 

OPINION S 

LmER TO THE EDITOR 
candidate death 

threats were disturbing 
Editor: 

I could see from the vety start 
of campaigning that A.S. elections 
this year were going to be messy 
and ugly. On the other hand, 
they've also been more exciting 
this yea r than any of the previous 
years that r have been here. What I 
didn't anticipate is that they were 
also going to be dangerous for the 
candidates involved. After the 
grievances were heard on Friday 
and the elections resul ts read, some 
of the disqualified candidates were 
yelling death threats at people on 
opposing slates. DEATI [ 
THREATS! Give me a break l 
Sure, I know that the people 
involved probably weren 't at all 
serious when they issued the 
threats, but the fact that they could 
even think about saying such 
things is seriously disturbing. I also 
know that all of the candidates who 
ran and the people who helped 
them put a lot of time, effort and 

hopes into this election, and I 
respect that. But it is still just a uni-
verSity student council election, 
and it's not worth threatening the 
lives of other human beings. I als.o 
find it bitterly ironic that this 
comes on the eve of a day when 
thousands of prospective students 
and their parents will flood IOta 
our campus and hear people tell 
them how great UCSD is and how 
much they like being here because 
the people here 3rc terrific. I won-
der if the people who were making 
death threats - the same people 
who claim to want to serve the stu-
dents and represent our school -
thought about how such vile 
behavior reflects on them and on 
the university as a whole. To any of 
the people who have given death 
threats in any form to someone 
else because of this election, I say: 
"Shame on you and get a hold of 
yourself." And most of all, please 
remember: It is just an election.

"Thi IS the first time ever at 
UCSD that an elections commit-
tee has abused power in tlus way," 
said Students Fir t! presidential 
candidate Kevin hawn Hsu . 
"Three thousand students decided 
who they wanted in office; the 
elections conunittee decided oth-
erwise. They basically threw out 
the voice of the tudents." 

The grievance leading up to the 
slate' disqualification was filed by 
vice president internal candidate' 

teve York of the ew SUldents 
First of the Unity Action Parking 
Wave late slate. York was accom-
panied by the slate's presidential 
candidate Bnan Uiga and sUldent 
advocate Robert Fourazandeh. 

The defen e was presented by 
tudents First

' 
commissioner of 

tudent advocacy candidate 
Viviane Pourazary and witnesses, 
commi sioner of communications 
candidate Frances Galvon and 
commissioner of diversity affairs 
candidate Stephanie Aguon. 

F ourazandeh had argued several 
cases opposing Students First! 
throughout the election period, 
including Uiga v. Studmts Fim.', the 
first case brought against the slate, 
for which the committee ruled that 
Students First! nad violated bylaws 
by using the material of AS.-fund-
ed org:rnizations to craft posters 
that would hold space for Students 
First! posters. Fourazandeh also 
successfully defended independent 
presidential c:mdidate Kevin Hsu 
against Srudents First! vice presi-
dent of finance candida te I-iarish 
Nandagopal and served as prosecu-
tion in the second nearing held on 
April II, in which Students First! 
candidate for Thurgood Marshall 
College Senior Senator Jonathan 
Abeye was accused of campaigrung 
111 the classroom. In both cases 
heard April II, Fourazandeh a ked 
the elecoons commmee to dl qual-
ify the entire slate. 

"(The deCISion) IS a very dra tic

ing the announcement. "It's some-
thing that's probably never been

Poster pains: Students First! candidates and supporters stand In disbelief at the Price Center after it was announced the 
entire slate was disqualified for violating elections b~aws . The eledions committee voted 4-3 in favor of disqualification. 

Fourazandeh said he has volun-
teered his services to help change 
the bylaws. 

"This is not a good thing, but I 
feel that it was something that 
needed to be done to make the sys-

Hate protested with silence Students ~rotest 
controversial ads Students call 

attention to 
LGBT 

persecution 
By CHRlmNE KWON 

Staff Writer 

Students at UC 0 took pan in 
the ational Day of Silence on 

pril 9, protesting against discrim-
ination oflesbian, gay, bisexual and 
transgender individuals in schools. 

The campu community par-
tiCipated in the protest by joining 
fellow students in a day almost 
entirely spent in silence. The silent 
aspect of the day was intended to 
call attention to the silencing of 
haras ed and abused people as a 
result of their exual orientation 
and biological makeup. Wearing 
black" ational Day of Silence" 
T-shirts, supporters of the protest 
gathered ro have lunch in the Price 
Center, hand out explanatory fly-
ers on Library Walk and eat a free 
dinner before a ceremonial 
"breaking of the silence." 

Headed by UCSD student 
Brian Dagan, members from vari-
ous on-campus organizations, 
including the Lesbian, Gay, 
Bisexual and Transgender 
Association made black banners 
posted across Price Center that 
proclaimed mottos like "What 
Are You Doing to Break the 
Silence?" and displayed graphic 
accounts of victimized students 
like 17-year-old Adam Coulton 
who, as a result of revealing his 
homosexuality, had the word

Other panels exhibited informa-
tion about hate crimes, including a 
survey by the Gay Lesbian and 

traight Education Network that 
found four out of five LGBT stu-
dents experienced verbal, sexual, 
or physical harassment at school. 

The day ended with a silent 
dinner at the Cross Cultural 
Center, where a table of free fly-
ers, T-shirts, stickers and collect-
ed newspa per articles on issues 
concerning the LGBTA were 
available for students to peruse. 
Individuals crowded on the floor 
and on tables to eat in silence 
while watching the muted movie 
"The Laramie Project" as com-
mittee leaders scribbled direc-
tions on a whi teboard. Students 
were also encouraged to POSt per-
sonal feelings and experiences on 
a large black billboard . Poems, 
personal confessions and hard-

ships faced by the LGBT commu -
nity were expressed through this 
written medium, including 
accounts like "1 was born a person 
of color .. . I was born queer ... I 
was born ... ] have been silenced 
since I was born." 

The silence was fi nally broken 
unanimously at 6:40 p.m. with an 
eruption of shouts and applause. 
The students then discussed sev-
eral issues about sexual discrimi-
nation, positive and negative reac-
tions from fellow students and fac-
ulty, and what they learned from 
participating in the Day of 
Silence. While some expressed 
their satisfaction from a positive 
and accommodating attitude from 
professors and faculty, others 
described their shock and anger 
from inappropriate srudent reac-
tion. Many negatively commented

Carnpustruth.org's anti ...

A series of advertisements for

Vegi lunches halted 
Club found to have violated rules 

By EVAN McLAUGHLIN 
News Editor 

The vegetarian lunches served 
on the second floor of the Student 
Center were suspended because the 
srudent organization providing the 
lunches violated UCSO food ser-
vice rules, university officials said. 

The Vegetarian Club and Vedic 
Culture Society, a registered stu-
dent organization that ho ted hot 
vegetarian lunches three times a 
week at UCSD, was told that they 
had violated a campus health code 
that states "temporary food facili-
ties may only be operated three 
days per quarter." According to 
University Centers Director Gary 
Ratcliff, organizations that serve 
morc frequently than a temporary 
food facility are required to adhere 
to stricter serving regulations. 

"There are health code require-
ments as to what type of facility you 
need to have if you're giving food 
out three times a week," Ratcliff 
said. "Once you get to a certain 
threshold, you're almost a full -
fledged restaurant and you're held 
to stricter health code regulations." 

According to Jon Schmidt of the 
Environmental Health and Safety 
Department, tile vegetarian lunches 
were on par with the health codes 
applicable to temporary food facili -
ties. chmidt said the food was reg-
ularly prepared at a facility in Pacific 
Beach and that he was assured by 
the group' cooks that food was pre-
pared, transpoTted and served under 
the gUIdelines for temporary food 
facllitie set by EllS. 

Phone calls to Goura Perey, a 
principal member of the Vegetarian 
Club and Vedic Culture Society, 
were not returned by press time. 

Ratcliff said the complaint was 

David Safford/Cuordion file 
Unfair competition?: Until recently, lunches were selVCd by the Vegetarian dub; 
the lunches were discontinued due to alleged health code ViolatIOns. 

originally voiced by Rob Porter, 
the owner and operator of Porter's 
Pub. Ratcliff contends that Poner 
had a legitimale concern to raise 
the issue as he must figure the costs 
of abiding by stricter health regula-
tions while paying rent and mainte-
nance for a permanent establish-
ment into his food prices. 

"[Porterl is paying rent to have 
a presence on thiS campu ," Ratcliff 
aid. "At some point, it's no longer 

a level playing field when we're 
putting independent restaurant 
owners who are paying leases, rent 
ami utilities at an unfair disadvan-
tage." 

Porter said that it was unfair to 
serve food without following the 
campus codes. 

"When r went up to the second 
floor of the Student Center, it looked 
a lot like a restaurant for business," 
Porter said. "The profits from my 

restaurant support my family, and it's 
unfair that I have to follow certain 
nues when others aren't." 

Porter said he was aware of the 
club's popularity and that he had 
approached the organizers of the 
vegetarian lunches about using the 
pub's facilities to serve vegetarian 
lunch and about adding new vege-
tarian options to the pub's menu. 

The vegetarian lunches, which 
were served three times a week at 
the Srudcnt Center, were free of 
charge, but the dub requested a $3 
donation. Frequent patrons of the 
Vegetarian Club and Vedic Culrure 
Society's lunch events were disap-
pointed the club's regular service 
was discontinued at UCSD. 

"I'm upset that it's gone," said 
taff member Kathy Reed. "The 

food was good and cheap. a veg-
etarian, I really appreciated anoth-
er option to the food co-op." 

UC sues AOL Time 
Warner over stock 

Silence: 
Frat makes 
derogatory 

gestures By THOMAS NEELEY Senior Staff Writer 
The University of California 

will file a law~ult thiS week 
against AOL Time Warner, their 
autillor and their financial adl'is-
ers, claiming AOL ml represcl1I-
cd its revenucs and subscriber 
numbers prior to and after the 
2001 merger with Time \Varner, 
which led to the collapse in price 
of AOL 'lime Warner stock. The 
UC Board of Regents aUlhorlzed 
the suit at their April 3 meeting. 

The university owned nearly 
11.3 million shares of Time 
Warner stock valued at $ 00 mil -
lion at the time of the merger and 
owned no shares of AOL. The 
reduction in stock price of the 
company resulted in a net loss to 
the University of California of 
more than $450 million . The 
University of alifornia is expcct-
ed 10 seck recovery of these losses. 

"That's the window of para-
meters that you shoot for," said 
U spokesman Trey Davis. "It ' 
cldom the Sltuallon where you 

recover all the money in thcse 
cases. " 

A spokesman from AOL Timc 
\,yarncr wa, unavailable for COIll , 
ment Ill' press lime. 

OL Time Warner has restJI , 
ed Its earnmg~ down nearly 200 
million. Due to Invesngatlon~ by 
(he Securities and Exchange 

oml11ission and Ihc Justice 
Departmcnt regarding some of 
its advertising deals, the company 
may be reqUired to restate them 
by as InU h a $400 million more. 

The University of alifornia 
is alleging AOL engaged in 

"round trip exchanges," where 
the company wapfJcd advertising 
with other Internet companies 
and counted these transactIOns as 
revenucs and allowed the comp,l-
ny to Inflate liS earnmgs. 

The law Ult also names the

cial adVisor; Involved In the 2001 
AOL 'Time Warner merger, 
including Citigroup, alol11on 

mith Barney and Morgan Stanley 
Inc. The niversity of alifornia 
is also targeting AOL Time 
Warner's director and officers 
that the univerSity said benefited 
from the misrepresentation. 

"They were involved in perpe-
trating the fraud that deceived 
investors - keeping the stock 
price artificially inflated in order 
to execute the merger and gener-
ate large per onal profits for a 
number of the directors," Davis 
aid.

Although there arc other uits 
against AOL Tllne Warner, Davi 
said that the University of

sue Its II1terests, which werc

As of April II, A L ' rime 
Warner stock was valued at 
$12.30 per share, t10wn from a

and a high of $48 per share at the

Campus groups 
encourage increased 

involvement in di~')r)el1l 
against the? war 

£l s the war with Iraq contin-ues, students across the nation continue to protest or peace. While the movcmem at 
U SO may be minimal in compari-
son to other universities, the feelings 
and wishes of those involved are stili 
the amc. tudent groups, including 
the UC 0 Peace Coalioon, Campus 
Greens and the International 
Socialist Organization, which are all 
pan of tile an Diego Campus Anti-
War Network, have organized rallies 
and teach-ins, and have engaged in 
discussions regarding the future of 
the anti-war movement. This is all 
done in an effort to spread awareness 
of the existing simation and erase the 
ambivalence felt by many sUldents. 

"It's sad growing up in a country 
where the government doc n't care 
about the rest of the world and ilS 
own people," said Eleanor 
Roo ' evelt Collcge sophomore 
Lind ay I [arris. 

I Iarris and Peace Coalition 
member Talitha Matlin, also a 
Roo evclt sophomore, credit the 
teach -i n orgalllz.ed by the com mu-
nication department for educating 
them 011 the facts and motivating 
them to take a completely ami -war 
stance. Professors spoke on topiCS 
lI1c1uding unpubli hed photographs 
from the first ulf War and the 
geological environment around 
I.raq . T he teach -in, attended by 
over 100 srudcnlS, was deemed uc-
cessfu l by department chair 

.coffrey Bowker. 
" It was a great discussion," he 

said. "We had pcople on both 
sides. " 

The teach-Ill had a profound 
effe t on the opinion of those who 
attended. 

"We were morally opp sed 

before," Matlin aid. "But after, from 
a political and economlC stance, we 
were completely oppo ed." 

oon after, Harris and Madin, 
along with other srudenlS, orga-
nized a peace protest, which was 
held on ;\-Iarch 14. 

"There was nothing being done 
on campus to show how we felt," 
lIarris said . 

To publicize the evem, they put 
up flyers across campu Jnd scm e-
mails, asking reCipients to forward 
them to friends . During the 
protest, mdent marched up and 
down Library Walk and formed a 
human peace sign in front of Geisel 
Library. 

peeches were made by profes-
sor Tom Cardoza and Roo evelt 
sophomore Ivcne I lerman. AI 0 in 
attendance wcrc seven mcmbers of 
the College Republicans, who 
voiced their opposition to the anti -
war tance. 

"They were very disrespectful," 
said I farris , who added that the 
group also engaged in name-call-
ing. 

The event was covered b}' sever-
al local television and radio new 
staoons. 

"They asked why we were there, 
and we sa id that we think there are 
;1 lot of people who feel the anti-
war sentiment, and wanted the feel-
ings to be heard," I larris said. 

She and Matlin were di ap-
pointed with the coverage. 

"The media portrayed [the 
group of College Republican ] a 
being JUSt as large as us, when there 
were around 300 of us and seven of 
them," Ilarris said. 

In addition to the prote t on 
March 14, a group of 20 to 25 

CS 0 student attended a protest 

in Balboa Park on March t6. 
"f was impressed that we got 

people to go on the unday before 
linals," Matlin said . 

Their dissent has drawn mixed 
reactions from die srudclH body. 

.. ome people have been sup-
portivc. They say peace, give us the 
peace sign, and get into converSJ-
tions with us on the shuttle," llarris 
said. Others have shown their sup-
POrt by wearing T- hins With <1I1ti -
war mes ages. 

" I t's sad growing up in a 
country where the gov, 
emment doesn't care

Roosevelt College sophomore 

Those with 3 pro-war stance, 
however, have also publicized their 
feelings, many having done so in a 
Ie s polite manner. 

"When one student was pUlling 
up prOtest signs, someone said to 
them, 'I'm JUSt going to tear it 
down after you put it up,'" Matlll1 
said. Matlin recalls that opposing 
sentiments also gOt more personal. 
"We've also been called hippie 
trash, and I was spat on ." 

ThiS kind of discrimination 
again t anti-war prote tors ha 
been rampant.

very well-informed," said Omar 
Clay, a member of several anti-war 
srudem organizations. 

Most feeling on campus appear 
to be ambivalent. 

"Overall, the feehng arc apa-

passive and not moved," Clay sald. 

Matlin though indicated the 
growing engagement With the war. 

"Most who [oppose warl didn't 
have opinions before," she .tId . 

Rallies and other campus events 
have given these dissenters reas-
surance that they are not the only 
ones with such feellllgs.

your own," Harns saJd . 

Groundwork Books, the ite of 
some of the most VIsible ano-war

vided support to the campus anti-
war movement. Throughout the 
tore, one can see signs and buttolls 

declaring, "Stop the War on Iraq," 
" top Fundlllg the Occupation" 
and" 0 Blood for Oil." It wel-
comes flyer regarding war-related 
activities and sells t-shirts With 
anti-war messages. 

"\Ve 've even closed the store to

employee Joaquin Murrieta. 

tudents with anti -war views 
have appreciated tile store's envi-
ronment. 

"They're very happy tllCY can 
lind a reinforcement that they're 
nOt alone, that there are other II1Sti-

Murrieta aid. I Ie al 0 aid that a

IIlg viewpoint had not engaged III 
any direct confrontations with the 
taff, but that "you can ee that

protesting the war 111 Iraq, the store 
also harbors posters protesting the 
internal war agaillst civil liberties. 

The communication depart-
ment has further showed its dis ent 
to the war by draftlllg an anti-war

nlike the Chrisnnas season, 
Lent i a time of repentance for 
tho e who are followers of the 
Christian faith. During this time, 
students acro campus abstain 
from vanous food, actl\;uc or 
certain acts to honor the sea on of 
Lent, which began on March 5 and 
end on April 19, Holy aturday. 

Lasting for forty days after Ash 
\ Vednesday, excluding un days, 10 
commemorate the resurrection of 
C hrist, Lent is seen as a ti m e of 
preparation for Easter. During the 
eason , self-examination , soul-

day are symboltc tn the Bible as 
dlsclplllle and devotion and are 
mentioned multiple tunes, such a 
the forty days that Jesus went into 
the wilderness to fast and pray after 
he wa baptized. 

In decid tng what to give up for 
Lent, many students find them-
selves choosi ng the th in gs they 
thought they could not live wi th-
out. 

"I'm gi \'ing up caffei ne fo r

For othe rs, a life tyle ch3llge 
comes about from practici ng Lent. 

"I didn 't even really give up 
anything like weets, candy, soda or

I'm giving up not being joyous for

John 1\l l1lr College fre hlmn Noa h

Lent proves to be a challengi ng 
process, because some rudents 
find themselves not being able to

There's a 'Sucker' 
born every minute 
Swain explores seedy 
gambling underworld 

By LISA MAK 
Staff Writer 

It is often said that first impres-
sions last a lifetime. At first glance, 
magician and author James Swain 
seems like your average honest, 
well -to-do fellow. YCt, if you give 
him a deck of cards and play a few 
hands with him , you will qu ickly 
reali ze that amidst the friendly 
person a is a pair of dexterous 
hands, a quick eye and a masterful 
mind . 

The list of uicks up Swain's 
sleeve seems endless: sleight of 
hanJ, steering, Kentucky setups, 
preferential shuffling. As a chi ld , 
he was fascinated with the world of 
magic and began practicing tricks, 
specifically in the area of sleight of 
hand. Later on, Swain wrote three 
books on card uickery and created 
a set of instructional sleight of 
hand videos that are now a must-
see for casino securi ty teams. 

·Yet, in addition to his repute as 
a sleight of hand artist, Swain 
became fascinated with the world 
of gambli ng and casino crimes. 
Thi fascination began in 1987, 
when wain saw a man succeed in 
camming a blad.iack game at The 
olden ugget cas illo in Las 

Vegas. Later, when wain was dis -
cus ing the minor scam with the 

ugget's resident magician, 'like 
kinne r, kinne r pro ceeded to 

recount an incident in which the 
casino had lost $175,000 to a 
group of scammers. Upon hearing 
this story, Swain began researching 
the shady world of casino crimes. 

"The e c rimes are very, very 
interesting to me because they're 
invi si ble," Swain said. 

Through his contacts in the 
magic world, Swain met and 
befriended ex-hustlers, gamblers, 
cops and casino security officers in 
an effort to understand this realm 
of cheating. I Je gradually accumu-
lated a collection of scams, and in 
1997, his wife suggested that he 
put these stories to print. 

"It's because of something a 
cheater said to me,» Swain said. 
"We went into the MGM Grand, 
and he said, 'They have a thousand 
cameras. They have 30 full-time 
surveillance people. They have a 
multi-million dollar way of trying 
to catch cheaters. And they're 
afraid of one thing - the mind. 
Because the nund constantly OUt-
wits them . 'And I said, 'This would 
be great fodder for books .'" 

This fodder led to the creation 
of the character Tony Valentine, a 
retired Atlantic Ci ty cop who has 
keen instincts , a sharp eye and a 
"grift-sense ," or the ability to spot 
a scam. Based on an ex-hustl er 
whom wain had met , Valentine 's

Lent: Seeking penance in 
weeks leading to Easter 
continued from page I ~ 

a personal spirinlal growth. She 
said, "I am not giving stuff up for 
Lent because a religion tell me to. 
1 am doing it to humble myself 
before Easter. 1 think what you give 
up should be something you really 
love or love to do, because it makes 
you realize how llIuch Jcsus gave 
up for us at the cross. That IS why 
r gave up AlM and online shop-
ping. Also, every time you realize 
you can't have something, it serves 
as a constant reminder of YOllr 
intention ." 

Other students choose to prac-
tice abstinence from something 
only when they feci compelled to, 
not nece sarily because of Lent. 

"As a Christian, I live by the 
guidance of the Holy Spirit, rather 
than ob en'ed traditions and holi-
days to teU me what I should do in 
my daily life, and fasting is one of 

those area ," said Muir junior 
Stephen \ lI . 

t the end of forty days, many 
are urprised at the changes they dis-
cover in themselves and their growth 
as a person . 

" I gave up white flour, rice and 
all kinds of dc~scns . It was rcally 
hard becall;e nOllr IS in every-
thing But it tallght mc how pow-
erful >od IS and how he can 
answer our prayers. And when I

man Emily DeRoos, who COI11 -
pleted a 40 day fast prior to Lent. 

0, whether it be addictive 
food, pesky habits or everyday 
activi ties, acri fices for Lent are 
teaching student self-control as 
well as self-realization, while they 
prepare for the Iioly \Veek before 
Easter. 

Sucker: Unique fiction 
tells of gambling con men 

continued from page '3 
character chases after casino cam-
mers and finds the flaws that 
allowed the casino to be scammed. 

"Grift ense" and "Funny 
Money," were wain's widely 
acclaimed first two novels . I l is 
third book, "Sucker Bet," was 
relea ed this year, which puts 
Valentine into yet another ltuurion 
of scamming and Intrigue. This 
time, two con men succeed in rig-
ging a blackjack game at an IndIan 
reservation casino as well a a game 
how, and Valentine is hired to 

solve the scam. Il is search to 
unravel the scheme lead him to a 
ruthles gang ter, his partner-in-
Crime and a prostitute. Their plans 
involve conning NIgel Moon, a 
very wealthy retired musician. 

All of the scams Swain de cribe 
have actually been u cd before by 
ex-hustlers. Through his contact 
with ex-con men, he was able to 
learn these scams and incorporate 
them in hiS works. Swain prO\~des 
insight into the relation hlp 
between cross-roaders, or people 
who specialize 111 scamlTUng casI-
nos, and grift-catchers, who spe-
cialize in stopping them. 

Swain' pro e, quirky but believ-
able characters, int:ricate plotS and 
dark humor allow his novels to 
stand out against other series in the 
mystery genre. He convincingly 
creates worlds of intrigue and illu-
sions, where no one is who he 
appears to be. Moreover, his insid-
er knowledge of gambling and casi-
no cheating lend a very realistic 
quality to the booles. Even a person 
who has no experience in gambling 
can easily understand hiS plotS. 

"My booles are steeped in 
truth," Swain said. "r realized a lot 
of booles that I read where there

Volleyball: Foott plays last 
collegiate game for Tritons 

continued from page :20 
nights, UCSD played guest to a 
senior night as UCSB celebrated 
the careers of cheir four seniors. 

The home team's celebration 
appeared to be shon-lived, how-
ever. as the Tritons came out 
hitting .484 and took the first 
game 30-23 . The Gauchos 
refused to be deterred by the 
Tritons and they came bacle 
strong. hitting .467 for the rest 
of the match and were able to 
take the 3- 1 win (23-30, 30-28. 
30-24. 30-22). 

The loss came despite strong 
efforts from both Waller and 
Perrine, who picked up 22 lcills 

and 51 assists , respectively. 
Senior middle blocker Brian 
Foott put up good numbers in his 
final collegiate appearance with 
II lcills, a team-high seven blocks 
and a .400 attaclcing percentage. 

While the Tritons' season is 
over, they will look to retool and 
regroup in hopes of a better sea-
son next year. The Tritons fin-
ished last in the MPSF. but the 
development they showed this 
season and the number of close 
matches in which they were 
engaged give UCSD faithful 
hope that the Tritons may not be 
the perennial cellar-dwellers of 
the MPSF

18 SPORTS THE U D GUARDIAN MONL>AY, APRIL 14,2003 

Cal-Nevada: UCSD beat many 0 ... 1 teams SENIOR SENDOFF 
continued /rom page 19 

The men's team had several 
standouts In a Wlde range of events. 
In addition to Cunningham's duo 
of fourth-place finishes In the 110 
and 400 hurdles, the Triton ruIned 
in solid performances in a number 
of other events. 

Cunningham also assisted in the 
eighth-place finish of the 4).-.;00 
relay team by running in a relay 
which also included Matt Horner, 
Brian Parisi and Matt Borz.age. 

Another eighth-place finish was 
handed in by junior Abel 
Aramburo, with a discus throw of 
166'2", the third-best all-time 

UC D mark and a CM provi-
sional qualif)~ng mark. 

UCSD's distance team's junior 
eil Kalra was cited by Salerno as 

"outstanding" and blew past con-
tenders to take the sixth-place POSI-
tion in the arduous 5,000 race lvith 
a time of 15:06.28. 

There was also a pair of ninth-
place finishes in the 3,000 steeple-
cha e, when freshman Carl 
Lostrom had the lOth-best all-time 
UC D standing on the record 
books with a run of 9:35 .74, which 
complimented Dunbar's earlier 
9:29.49 time in the same event. The 
meet's competition was tough as 

el'idenced by the fact that SDS 's 
women's track and field team won 
just six of the meet's 20 events to 
pullout a victory. UC D bettered 
or equaled many strong Division 1 
and highly ranked schools, which 
highlights the team's taste for com-
petition and to showcase its athletic 
progression ,vi thi n the season. 

"It was our best overall perfor-
mance and a good statement on our 
[athletic] programs," Salerno said. 

On April 18, the Tritons will 
head back to action at the Pomona-
Pitzer Invitational Claremont that 
begins at 9 a.m. in Claremont, 
Calif.

The experience of the players 
on the UCSD men's water polo 
team has led the team to success in 
recent years. That experience will 
be missed next season as the leader-
ship of four Tritons on the water 
polo team's roster will be graduat-
ing this June . 

Seniors goalkeeper Lance 
Onken, driver Kellan Hori, two-
meter offensive Bryon Spicer and 
two-meter defender Paul 

Mostchall all finished their water 
polo careers at UCSD, racking up 
many accomplishments in their 
four years on the team. 

The graduating group led the 
Tritons to three Western Water 
Polo Association conference cham-
pionships and many big wins. All 
four players remember upsetting 
USC in the 2000 Final Four to 
advance to the national champi-
onship, and each one said that is 
their fondest memory. Another

GIRLS 
~ ~ ,~ Well. it took a quote from Legally Blonde to make the imporbable happen. A lovely lady named Sheeree actually took home 
the cash and prizes last week! This makes UCSD Guardian 
history. And the only other guess (a mere 20 minutes late) 
was also from a non-he. Nice work, estrogenites! 

Thursday's quote will be more remote; however, most Tritons 
have probably seen the flick multiple times.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Softball: Tritons moves to 
18 ... 23 overall with losses 

continued from page ~o 
ted five errors in the game. 

Offense was a slightly brighter 
sidc for the Tritons though, who 
managed to produce seven hits 
while scoring three runs, one in 
the fifth and two in the seventh . 
Two of the team's three RBIs 
came from Cope, while the third 
came from freshman Desi ree 
Franciscus. Mettee, Hunstad and 
Franciscus scored the three runs 
for UCSD. 

The second game in the dou-
bleheader against the Coyotes 
ended in a 7-6 defeat for the 
Tritons. Starting junior Jodie 
Bland pitched five innings, 
receiving a no-decision, while 
sophomore Keri Hanley took 
the loss for her two innings of 
relief, putting her record at 5-

10. 
The Triton's offense started 

off slow, only scoring one run 
through the first five innings. 
I Iowever, they stepped it up and 
scored four in the sixth, and one 
in the seventh off a Cope solo 
home run, but they were still one 
run short of the Coyotes. 

"Right now we're fighting 
ourselves and beating ourselves 
up," Gerckens said. 

UCSD's record is now 18-23 . 
Because only the games against 
San Bernardino were California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
games, the Tritons C AA record 
is 9- 13. The Tritons' next games 
will be against UC Davis and 
Chico State on April 18 and April 
19, respectively, both of whjch 
are away games. 

Tyler Huff/Guo/dlOn file 
Road trip: The Tritons will have to rebound from their lOSing streak on the road 
They wtll play at DaVIS, ChiCO and Bakersfield before retumlng home on May 2.
