Med school students 
rated fi rsf in nation 
The Universit~ of California at San Diego, 

already famous for its stellar achievements in 
the natural sciences, added another page to its 
book last week when Clifford Grobstein, dean of 
the UCSD Medical School. announced that 
students of the second class have received 0 , I 
ranking in a nationwide test. The exam, known 
as the National Medical Board Examination , is 
designed to test the students' academic 
knowledge and thus enable the school 's 
administrators to judge the standing of their 
class with respect to other schools . 

Out of 8,000 students from 81 medical schools 
across the country who took the exam. the 48 

CSD participants scored highest in terms of 
average grade . The students, now in their third 
yea r of medical tudies, took the exam in the 
spring of 1971. 

The purpose of the exam, accord 109 to Dean 
Grobstein. " is to allow medical schools to get 
an Idea of how well they are dOing . Our 
curnculum at the CSD chool of MedlclOe i 
innovative and we wondered how our students 
would perform on a standardized test such as 
this Their performance says we 're on the right 
track PlaclOg in th numb r one po Itlon IS a 
tribute to the stud nts, th excellent facultv, th 
curnculum. and the admiSSIOns and selectIOn 
proce s." 

GrobstelO added modestly , " ThiS I verv 
happv news for us , ObvlOusI'V, but we want to 
keep ' It in perspective -' it can be over-
inte rpreted "it's not like the Chargers wlnntng 
a champIOnship" 

The test result were unique , however. 10 that 
the CSD Med chool 's curriculum IS not 
"exam onented" Th high ranklOg wa 
achieved , accord 109 to Grob tetn . "despite the 
fact that our curnculum IS not designed for 
performances of this type In fact It'S kind of 
spectacular for our students to have done 0 
well. " The exam was almost excluslvelv 
academiC. and " we 're concerned just as much 
with how they p rform 10 clinical training" . 
A ked about the relative achievements of the 
stud nts in this aspect of the curriculum. 
Grobstem replied that he had received reports 
Irom the Medical Schoollaculty indlcatlOg that 
" our student are dOlOg ver~' well 10 clintcal 
tratning too " 

Another significant asp ct 01 th test re ults 
wa their con iderable Improvement over the 
ellorts 01 the charter cia s. wh ich ranked 24th 
nationallv In the same examination last vear. 
Harold J: Simon. the school's Dean of Students. 
attri buted this Improvcm nt to alterations in 
the "core" course and the additIOn 01 elec tive 
course "greater In number and more attuned 
to th needs 01 the titdents' He aid that. due 
to student Input. the laculty had adapted 
courses to what the student conSidered

everything from simple names ($3 1 
and small roses (about $5 ) to full body

UCSB teacher program 
given full accreditation 

Full accreditation for the teacher training program at UC 
Santa Barbara has been Jlranted by the State Board of 
Education following a study of the effects of the Isla Vista nots 
of 1970, 

Promopted by conservative members of the Board who 
char/led that the disturbances in Isla Vista had adverselv 
affected the school o[ education, a lull·scale investigation wa's 
begun last summer , The committee found that the " riots did 
not have a deleterious effect upon any of the credential 
programs al the UCSB campus," The school of education , the 
committee aid , " was one of the least affected segments of the 
Universitv" and pursued its own goals " wllh minimal 
IIlterference" from the riots, 

"Students and facultv were so absorbed in the demallds 01 a 
qualitv professional program thai thev had little time or 
inclination for campus political activities, " the committee 
said, 

The study reaffirmed the findings of an earlier dean's report 
which stated , " there had been no disruption or reconstitution 
o[ courses in the school of education," " ~o new evidence was 
found to contravene this conclusion," 

The Board of Education had suspended accreditation to the 
teacher training program pending the findings of the special 
committee, After the report was turned in the board approved 
full accreditation as originally recommended by its own 
regular accreditation committee.

California higher·education 
officials will remember 1971 as 
the worst financial year 10 
recent history , According to 
the LOS ANGELES TIMES, in 
1970 the legislature, angered by 
outbursts of violence on several 
campuses, struck back by 
denying [acuIty members a 5 
per cent salary increase , This 
year, With most campuses 
quieted down, the mood was 
different. Sacramento was not 
in a mood to punish higher 
education, but neither was it 
ready to hand out many 
rewards, 

Financiallv , 1971 was 
disastrous for the University , 
the state colleges and 
communit.v colleges, though 
the responsibility rests more 
with the governor than with the 
legislature 

" It is not unfair to say these 
were the most stringent 
budgets the University and the 
state colleges have had to deal 
with ," savs William Storey, 
assistant d'ire"tor of the state"s 
Coordinating Council for 
Higher Education, 

The tate colleges were 
asked to absorb 17,000 to 18,000 
additional students while losing 
250 faculty posItions throughout 
the 19·campus system , The 
Unlversitv sYstem had to 
accommodate roughlv the 
same enrollment as the year 
before with lOO fe'wer 
professors, 

No new funds were 
appropriated for C 
construction and verv few were 
spent on state college building 
Both svstems suffered a Wide 
range of other budget cut . 

The Legislature increased 
Gov. Reagan 's onginal budget 
proposals for the current vear 
by $25 million for C and 522,5 
million for the state colleges. 
but Reag an vetoed the 

increases, 
The 10 per cent faculty pay 

raise was also approved by the 
legislature but vetoed bv the 
governor , It would have cost 
more than $40 million. and he 
said the state did not .have the 
monev, 

Later in the seSSIOn, both the 
Senate and the Assemblv 
passed another bill calling for it 
7,5 per cent faculty pay raise 
but again the governor vetoed 
the measure, on the grounds 
that no revenues were provided 
to pay for the increase, 

The governor also vetoed an 
additional SIS million in state 
funding for community 
colleges and a special $1.3 
million appropriation which 
would have made up for a 
decline 10 UC income due to 
this year's sharp increase In 
out-of·state tuit ion fees 

The governor and the 
Legislature did agree to permn 
a $160 million bond Issue for 
community collej(e 
construction to appear on the 
November, 1972, ballot. 

TheV also approved a $294 
million health sciences bond 
for the Unlve r sitv of 
C a I if 0 r n I a , wit h ' I e s's 
enthusiasm , UC officials said 
the amount might be reduced 
since Reagan has IOdicated he 
would supporl a smaller bond 
issue but might remain neutral 
if the $294 million figure is 
retained , 

After a one·year lapse, the 
state 's graduate fellowship 
program was revived, largely 
du e to the effo rt s of 
Assemblvman Frank 
Lanterman The program was 
dropped a ,vear ago because 
there no longer eemed 10 be a 
need for additional college 
teachers, But Lanterman 's bill 
turned the program IOtO 
general support and 10 that

Reasoning-ConclusioDS 
Conflict 

Per haps th e prin Cipal 
problem With the book is the 

co nflict betwcen It S 
prel iminary reasoning on 
sexual values and its 
conclusions The same author 
who can frankly state that a 
member of this generatIOn is 
" Ill love With himself" and 
motll'a ted pnnrlpa II v by erotiC 
and other pleasu res because

:'>1akolm decld d that the ' If It

from Neurolic Puratanlsm If It

Rul even on these borrowed

Malcolm 's argument Will not 
stand, Thi S decade has leatured 
the most "open" and " honest" 
attitude toward sex In 
American historv In movies.

Winter Quarter. huh? The 
surfs too cold. the sun is barelv 
up at all . and there are even 
vicious rumors that the San 
Diego Chamber of Commerce 
lets it rain here! :'Ieed 
somethinl! to do to keep active 
during the winter's 
hibernation ? The Intramural 
Department has cooked up 
some fine things for winter -
most of them in the friendlv . 
warm UCSD gym. And things 
are gettinl1 under wav in a 
hurrv. . 

First. for you super-jocks 
who figured that varsity 
basketball was too easy 
I besides. it's a drag having to 

... cut vour hair. do exercises. 
men 'S intramural 

offers some fine-
competition . Lee 

is going to try and split 
the teams into Muir and 
velie Leagues . and 

there will be a 
strong Open Leal1ue (watch for 
'_arrv lcerman to field another 
powerhouse I . Argo II with 
Clain Campagna . and Doug 
Beanan are back to defend 
their title. and claim to be 
better than last vear. Men 's 

is not just for these 
.up4!rst.ars however. Most of 

are Just out for good 
and the enjoyment of 

sport. 
those of vou shorties like 

who find that a game of 
consists of having shot 

snOI crammed down vour 
t. the Pee Wee League 

'10" and uJlder I offers 
Ivatlon . Imagine the joys of 
ytng low post and stuffing 

the 0pposltion 's towenng 
5'912 ' center ' A new ruling this 

allows anv man to be on 
onlv one me~'s roster. I.e. 
either rel1ular or Pee Wee. 

means that a Monk Waite 
Damon Dallstratv will only

. guv ? I. 
now lor the good part -
are three excl tmg coed 

oltered this Quarter' 
ba ketball debuts thiS 
r and promises to be the 

success tha t coed footba II was 
in the fall. The rules that are 
available in Lee Johnson 's 
office have been designed to 
offer a good opportunity for the 
females to play Without 
handicapping the males too 
much. Will they work? We can 
only try and find out: as 
always . the Intramural 
Department wJ!l be flexible 
enoul1h to allow for any 
necessary changes. 

Coed basketball and both 
men 's and 5'10" and under 
basketball teams are forming 
right away. The captain 's 
meeting is this Thursday, Jan . 
6. folks . so get over to the 
Intramural Office and pick up 
your rosters right away. The 
coed meeting is at 3 p.m. 
Thursdav and both men 's 
meetings are at 4. Please have 
a team representative there 
even if your roster isn 't quite 
complete. Playing time in the 
gym is limited 1 for basketball . 
it will be Mondav. Wednesdav 
and Thursday nights and ail 
day Sunday and Sunday night I 
so we need to know how manv 
teams to schedule. . 

Coed soccer IS back thiS 
quarter under the watchful eye 
of Ann Higl1ins. Sign-ups will be 
next week . so start to get It 
together now and more detalis 
will be given next week. 

Coed badminton will happen 
every Tuesday night that 
there's no varsitv basketball 
game scheduled.' The entire 
gym floor will be available as 
long as there IS enough 
mterest. but If enthusiasm 
sags. the !!ym will be returned 
to Intramural basketball 
freaks . Remembel . thiS IS the 
quarter to get In some good 
pracllce for next quarter's 
tourney to flOd out who wJ!l 
represent UCSD at the All-Cal 
Tournament at UCSB.

Grapplers Face All-Cal Tourney 
Mark Liska 

The creaking joints and massive 
hulks begin to unlimber after a festive 
and freaky Christmas vacation . The 
UCSD wrestlers. or grapplers. if you 
are familiar with Howard Cosell. Jim 
Murray and all oth~J' famous sports 
heroes (including Dick Lane ). will 
have to mentally and phYSically come 
back to realitv very soon. with their 
first big match coming up on the 
weekend. 

This will be one of the greatest 
aggregations of collegiate wrestling 
talent. and naturallv. that means 
UCSD is going to another AII-Cal 
tournament. An All-Cal tournament. 
for those of vou who don 't know or 
don 't care . . features anv of the 
University of California ' campuses 
which care to participate. and these 
include the 30.000-plus big brothers. 
UCLA and Berkeley . Among the other 
UC campuses participating in this 
joyous affair are UC Davis. UCSD and 
UC Riverside. which is convenient 
since the tournament is being held at 
Riverside. 

This will definitely be one of the 
toughest matches of the year. The 

coaching staff realistically considers a 
third place finish a very good 
placement for this year 's team . The 
power-houses of the tournament are 
expected to be UCLA. which is 
surprising since they rarely have a 
good team in anything . much less 
wrestling or basketball. and DaVIS. 
which is bringing in all the farm boys 
for this vea r's team. The team is 
expected to leave friday for Riverside 
to get a good night's sleep. since the 
tournament get, an early start at 9. 
yawn. in the morning. 

After the difficult going up north. the 
sun should begin to shine at beautiful 
downtown Pasadena . at least for the 
UCSD wrestlers. Januarv 14 and 15 
bring two new dawns and' the Cal tech 
tournament. being held this year. 
strangely enough at Cal Tech in 
beautiful downtown Pasadena. Among 
the competition present will be 14. 
count ·em. 14 NA IA powers including 
the stiff competition of Clairemont-
Harvey Mudd. This match should 
prove to be more rewarding. since 
UCSD has been the champion for the 
past two years. UCSD is expected to 
place either first or second. and 
naturally it would be more fulfilling 

from a personal standpoint of a team 
member if they finished first : atleasl. 
that's the Ame'rican way. 

The people to do it this year include a 
brother-brother act and a lBO-pound 
pipsqueak . "Speedy" Javier Correa. 
who gave up a brilliant track career to 
wrestle here at UCSD. is expected to 
excel in his 134-pound category. He IS a 
returnee from I"st year who possesses 
skill. finesse ar.d. obviously. speed . 
Javier . being a very influential person. 
induced his brother to attend UCSD . 
and wasn 't it a surprise to all of us 
when it was discovered that his 
brother. George. is also a wrestler . a 
good one at that ? George is a little bit 
smaller. weighing either 118 or 126. 
depending what day of the week it is . 
but given time should grow into his 
shoes. The other wrestler expected to 
perform well is John Knapp. He will be 
wrestling in the 177-pound 
classification and should place high in 
most tournaments. 

At 'this point in time. the wrestling 
team is anticipating two very difficult 
and grueling weekends. However. they 
might be full of surprises and trophies . 
But as for the rest of us we 'll probably 
be better off sleeping. 

Tritons Play Even )OnLe/evier Track Meeting 
The Triton caj/ers came up with two wins and two losses 

during quarter break while most students were vacationing. 
Having started off the season losing to both Hayward State and 
cross town rival USIU in the La Jolla tournament sponsored by 
UCSD. the Tritons picked up victories over Northern Colorado 
and Sonoma State while losin/( to Cal Baptist and Redlands. 

Paul (Butch) Trainer leads the Tritons in scoring at this 
juncture with an impressive 22.5 points per game. Also scoring 
well IS Dave I Curtis) Wright with a 15.5 avera!!e. Curt started 
off the season with a whopping 30 points in the first !!ame. but 
hasn 't been scoring as well lately. One of the bi!! weaknesses of 
the Tritons this vear is lack of scoring punch. as evidenced by 
the fact that no other team member is scoring in double 
figures. Another problem that the Tritons are working on is 
lack of consistent rebounding. Trainer and Pete Henderson 
lead the team with 7.2 rebounds per game. 

The Tritons ' first victorv came over Northern Colorado. with 
the TriLons coming out on 'a tlJP of an 87 to 73 score. Then UCSD 
dropped their next game to Cal Baptist by 39 points. 98 to 6P . 
The Tritons rebounded by defeating Sonoma State without 
much difficulty by 16 points. but later fell to Redlands in a 
close game with a score of 61 to 56. 

The Tritons now stand for the year at 2 wins and 4 losses. 
Coach Cunningham plans to fa st-break more in upcoming 
games and hopefully open the game up and provide more 
sconng . The defense will be bolstered by the addition of Cal 
State LA. transfer Bruce I Phvness I Breathwaite. who will 
undoubtedlv prOVide some excitin~ moments for enthUSiastiC 
UCSD fans . The Tntons have three home games this week Wltll 
Pacific Chmtian toni"ht. Cal State Dominguez friday night 
and Dlversitv 01 Hawaii at Hilo ,complete with Hula giris l 
Sa turday night. All games WIll be played at B p.m. in the UCSD

Letters fo the Editor coDtiDued from page 4 
Muskie mistake 
Editor: 

The students of UCSD should 
not be thankful to Richard 
Robinson . UCSD Students for 
Muskie head . for givinl1 us all a 
new lesson in " How to Lie 
While Charging Someone Else 
With Lying With Statistics." 
,Actually Robinson did not lie. 
he just doesn 't know what he's 
talking about. 1 

In his response to my letter 
regarding Muskie's reluctance 
to integrate his tickel next year 
because it might mean the end 
of his political career. 
Robinson mention mv allusion 
to a recent Gallup Poll which I 
feel shows Muskie to be 
wrongheaded as to his opinions 
about the racial altitudes of the 
Amencan people . Robinson 
notes the 57 percent of the 
American people who said it 
makes "no difference" to them 
if the Presidential candidate o( 
their chOice picked a Black 
vice preSidential running mate. 
and then he declares : "ThiS 
sounds verv nice. of course. but 
it also means that no less than 
43 percen t wou Id not I these t 11'0 
words were set in bold lace for 
emphasis I vote for anv 
I boldlace I candidate Wllh a 
Black running mate .. 

The Gallup Poll . or course. 

showed nothing of the kind and 
one wonders where Mr . 
Robinson gOI hi s 43 percent 
figure . The Poll showed 24 
percent saving a Black on the 
ticket made it " less likelv" 
they 'd vote for the ticket: ' 13 
percent said "more likely": six 
percent had no opinion : and 57 
percent said " no diffcrence." 
Even if 43 percent said thev 
would not vote for a ticket with 
a Black in the number two spot. 
Sen . Muskie's statement that 
he would be unelectable with a 
Black on the ticket. IS SI1I1 
contradicted by the poll 

As for Mr :'ilxon 's PilSt 
behavior. Mr. Robm on . as one 
who obVIOusly puts great store 
10 keeping hiS logical armor 
chinkproof. should know that 
the tu quoQue . or sO's-vour-old -
man . form of argumentation is 
very. very weak What the 
President has or has not done 
in the past is totallv irrelevant 
when the topic bel ore the hou e 
IS the validit~' of an assumption 
put forth bv Senator Muskle. 

enouslv Dick. where did 
YOU 11e1 that 43 percent figure'
