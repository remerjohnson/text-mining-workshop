PIM: SF.! member Renee Maas negotiates with Chancellor Robert C Dynes and Senior Dinxtar of £xtemol Relations Edgar M.

Chancellors Eject SEJ 
Group to champion janitors' plight 
By LARA MoseRIP 
Staff Writer 

Members of Students for Economic Justice 
demanded a place on the agenda of the 
Chancellor's Associates meeting last Tuesday. They 
are attempting to direct the attention of Chancellor 
Robert C. Dynes and the UCSD community to the 
situation of the ununionized janitors subcontracted 
by UCSD. 

Prior to the meeting, SEJ members asked for 
time in the meeting's agenda and were advised by 
Senior Director of External Relations Edgar 
Gillenwaters that the meeting was not an appropri-
ate venue to air the group's demands. 

The students then joined hands in a single-file 
line and attempted to enter the meeting. 

Chanting "no justice, no peace," several students 
entered the tent where the meeting was held and 
addressed the audience. The group was quickly 
escorted out by security officials and members of 
the meeting. 

Ten minutes later, two police ca rs arrived on the 
scene and advised SEJ members to leave. 

A lectern near the tent 's entrance was knocked 
down and an SEJ member became entangled in 
the tent's fabric as a result of the resistance the 
group encountered while attempting to enter the 
tent. 

Eleazar Loza, a Warren freshman, managed to 
enter the tent. 

Loza enumerated the goals of the SE).

A.S.

Budget 
Counci I cuts 
cwo's line-item 
allocation 
By DANA WEST 
Staff Wnter 

The A.S. Council passed !l~xt 
year's cxecutiVl' budget in reCl)rd 
time Wednesday. A.S. Pn:sllknt Jeff 
Dodge's proposal presentcd several 
spending changes that he kit will 
benefit student life. 

"I feci like I'm really making .I 
positive difference in campus life:' 
Dodge said about the $I,133.4()O 
budget. 

The main distinction in the 
new budget is the Campus 
Activitv Fees Allocatloll5. 
According to Dodge, fundlllg 
some programs with different A.5. 
funds, such as revenues fmm ,\.s. 
Lecture Notes and the Gro\e 
Calk Dodge's budget may free lip 
more money for student orga niza-
tions and activities. 

Most co ntrovcrslal IS the 
absence of the Committee for 
Worla Democracy frolll the list of 
A.5. -funded student organiza-
tions. 

Previously categorized under the 
Cultural Awareness Program, CWD 
has traditionally been funded 
directly through the A.S. budget , 
instead of applying for funds 
through the Student Organization 
Funding Allocation Board as other 
student organizations do.

Technology Catches MMW Plagiarizers 
More uncited sources identified after using turnitin.com 
By JEFFREY WHITE 
Senior Staff Writer 

The Internet, which in the past 
few years has made plagiarism as 
easy as point-and-c1ick, cut-and-
paste, is now being used by UCSD 
and universities nationwide to 
fight the ultimate academic crime. 

With online term paper mills 
such as schoolsucks.com and 
Cheater. com making scholarly 
works accessible from any com-
puter with Internet acces~, the ease 
with which students can now steal 
information - or even entire 
papers - is unprecedented. 

Recognizing this kind of access 
as a threat to academic standards 
and honesty, two UCSD under-
graduate basic writing courses have 
employed the services of a Web-

based company, tumitin .com, to 
detect stolen text in papers. 

Roosevelt students taking 
Making of the Modem World and 
Marshall students taking 
Dimensions of Culture are now 
required to tum in their papers 
electronically to tumitin.com. This 
IS in addition to turning in hard 
copy papers to teaching assistants 
or professors as usual. 

Both courses are using the 
online service on a trial basis, and 
its further use 'and possible expan-
sion to other programs wi ll be 
reviewed after this quarter. 

Compositions submitted by 
students to turnitin.com are com-
pared to the site's own in-house 
database of all other papers turned 
in to the site during the three years 
of its existence. Next, tumitin .com 

uses specially designed software to 
search the Web for texts that are 
similar to that of the submitted 
work. 

Finally, a report is created , 
showing what percentage of the 
paper is original and what percent-
age is very similar to online 
sources. 

According to Director of 
Student Policies and Judicial Affairs 
Nick Aguilar, his office initiated the 
pilot programs last quarter to see 
how much it would help professors 
enforce academic honesty. 

"We arranged for the use of 
[turnitin.com) to assist instructors 
in detecting whether work turned 
in by students was not plagiarized, 
that it was indeed their work: 
Aguilar said, "And it's as much -
if not more - for the students so 

that their work is valuable." 
Susannah Smith , academic 

coordinator for MMW, said that 
without help it is very tricky to 
detect plagiarism. She said that 
often, TAs will just get the feeling 
that a paper was written by two 
different people. 

"What I've found in the last 
two years in MMW is that we've 
found instances of plagiarism 
every quarter, and they're almost 
always from the Internet: Smith 
said. "Frankly, it's astonishing that 
we catch anyone." 

The use of turnitin .com's ser-
vices seems to be working. 

"It does appear that instructors 
were able to detect a greater num-
ber of papers with text not cited to

Berkeley Undergrad May Be 
Next Student Regent-Deslgnate 

UC Berkeley undergraduate Dexter G. Ligot-
Gordon has been nominated student regent-des· 
ignate for the 2002·2003 term. Ligot·Gordon is 
a junior majoring in the political economy of 
industrial soc ieties. 

The regents ' Special Committee to Select a 
Student Regent has already approved Ligot-
Gordon. but he awaits consideration by the 
entire Board of Regents in September. If select-
ed as student regent·designate, he will be able

involvement. 

Tracy M. Davis is the next student regent. 

She follows Justin Fong, who is currently hold-
ing the position. and precedes Ligot·Gordon, if 
he is selected . 

UCSD, Caltrans Project Leads 
to New Highway Technology 

Researchers at UCSD, in partnership with 
CalTrans and the Defense Advanced Research 
Projects Agency, have developed new structural 
materials that have been applied to the Kings 
Stormwater Channel Bridge, a new highway 
bridge on State Route 86 near the Salton Sea, 

The bridge, which officially opened for use 
May 18, is notably not completely structured 
with steel rebar. Instead, it is supported by 
structural shells made from tubes of lightweight 
carbon fiber-reinforced polymers, which are then 
filled with concrete, This is an appealing alter-
native to traditional rebar, because rebar is 
expensive and relatively hard to work with. Also, 
the tubes do not corrode as rebar 's steel does, 

CalTrans and the university w ill not only 
apply new technology, they also plan to monitor 
and evaluate its effectiveness under the heavy 
traffic it experiences from people traveling 
between Mexico and Los Angeles through the 
Imperial Valley. 

Professor Frieder Seible, chair of the Irwin and 
Joan Jacobs School of Engineering's Department 
of Structural Engineering, designed the project .

Her main demand was that the subcontrac-
tor that supplies UCSD with its janitors, 
Bergenson 's Property Services, rehire 
Alejandra Rodriguez. 

Rodriquez was allegedly fired for attempt-
ing to unionize her co-workers. 

Other goals of the SEj include ensuring 
that the contractor pays a " living wage" of 
$11 .24 an hour. The group wants the contrac-
tor to supply workers with health insurance 
and allow the workers the right to organize 
unions.

In her brief conversation with Dynes out-

side the meeting, Maas asked Dynes for a 
guarantee that he would meet with members 
of SEj to address their grievances. 

Dynes insisted that he must wait unti l the 
vice chancellor returns from his absence so 
that Dynes may be briefed upon the situation 
involving Rodriguez and the janitors. 

"You must wait until he comes back so that 
we can have a meaningful discussion," Dynes 
said. " I want to be informed so that this is not 
just a fencing match." 

Dynes 1I1so acknowledged that he had 
recently been out of town . making it hard to 
guarantee a meeting with SEj members before 
the end of the school year. 

Dynes also said that the students "won't 
advance the case by being [at the meetingl. but 
by my -pushing the vice chancellor." 

Several members of SEj expressed sur-
prise and dismay at the high level of physical 
resistance they allegedly encountered as they

A.S. Council 
Should Increase 
Funds for Events 

The Guardian would ·like to praise the 
A.S. Council for its role in putting on Fri-
day's Sun God Festival. ot only was the 
concert a huge success, the day as a whole 
was full of entertainment and excitement 
for everyone at UCSD. 

For the first time all year, the campus 
joined together and participated in events 
that were enjoyable for everyone. With that 
said, the Guardian feels that the A.S. Council 
should make the days of Fa II Fest and Win-
tcrFest similar to that of Sun God to pro-
mote student life on the campus on two 
other occasions during the yea r. 

Now tha t the I\.S . budget ca lls for 
increased funding for FallFest and Winter-
rest, the Guardian feds that the A.S. Coun-
ci l should spend a portion of thi s money on 
hiring outside entertainment vendors, such 
as the owners of the rubber boxing gloves 
and the jousting arena . 

In addition, the advent of these games 
would make it appropriate for student orga-
nizations to set up their own booths for 
selling food, drinks and other services. 

The Guardiall recommends making 
FallFest and WinterFest all -day events 
because everyone involved stands to bene-
fit. Students would have two more days 
during the year to experience the excite-
ment and the energy that Sun God brings. 
Student organizations would benefit mone-
tarily because they would be able to sell 
food to the general public, while at the same 
time being able to inform the student body 
about what their group does. Also, the 
administration would prosper knowing it 
would have two more ways to market the 
school to prospective students. 

Although many students do not enjoy 
the music played during Sun God concerts, 
at the very least, most students would 
appreciate the chance to buy better, authen-
tic, home-made food on campus. 

As with Sun God, the students of UCSD 
would look forward to both FallFest and 
Winter Fest all year long. Although imple-
menting these events might require hiring 
additional security, a portion of the extra 
money allocated by A.S. President Jeff 
Dodge in the 2001-2002 budget could be 
used for this purpose. The extra $1,000 that 
it would cost to make WinterFest and 
FallFest full-day events would not dramati-
cally change the quality of the acts that the 
A.s. festivals committee would get. It would, 
however, dramatically change the quality of 
each day as a whole.

Moral Policing of the Internet Not 
UeSe Government's Responsibility 

Supreme Court must soon decide on whether censoring pornography on the 
World Wide Web is a legitimate constitutional practice to protect children 

By CLAIRE VANNETTE 
, 

Staff Writer 

Our government takes on many 
roles: provider for the poor, supporter 
of business, dispenser of justice and 
member of the world's community. 
These roles can be contradictory at 
times, but they all aim to serve the 
nation 's needs in a just manner by bal-
ancing the desires of competing groups 
and protecting our constitutional and 
human rights. 

In recent years, another role has 
been attributed to the government: 
monitor of morals. In a movement that 
transcends partisan differences, 
Democrats such as Tipper Gore and 
Sen . Joseph Lieberman and a wide 
range of Republicans, including Sen. 
John McCain , assert that it is the gov-
ernment's responsibility to limit the 
access that minors have to "indecent 
and/or obscene materials." 

Indeed. 1998's Child Online Protec-
tion Act, passed by a Republican House 
and signed into law by former President 
Clinton, states that "the protection of 
the physical and psychological well-
being of minors by shielding them from 
materials that are harmful to them is a 
compelling governmental interest." 

However, COPA was blocked by a 
federal appeals court in a suit brought 
by the American Civil Liberties Union. 

Citing the measure's unconstitu-
tionality, the court issued an injunction 
prohibiting the enforcement of the bill, 
which calls for up to a $150,000 fine 
and six months imprisonment for any-
one who offers material "harmful to 
minors" without making sure that' only 
adults have access to the product in 
question. 

Attorney General John Ashcroft has 
asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review 
the case; the court has agreed and will 
issue a ruling in October. 

A lot is at stake in the court's con-
sideration, and while the outcome is far 
from assured in light of recent accusa-
tions that the court is increasingly 

responding to partisan influences, the 
correct'course of action is clear. COPA 
is unconstitutional, much like the 
Communications Decency Act that was 
struck down by the Supreme Court the 
year before. 

Furthermore, COPA is clearly moti-
vated by the determination of individu-
als to assert their morality on the rest of 
our country rather than a desire to 
"shield" minors. 

The ACLU's challenge of COPA in 
1998 was straightforward: It asserted 
that the measure would not merely pre-
vent minors from viewing objectionable 
material, but would also infringe upon 
the right of adults to view these consti-

In recent years, another role 
has been attributed to the 
government: monitor of 
morals, In a movement that 
transcends partisan 
differences, Democrats ... and 
a wide range of Republicans 
. .. assert that it is the 
government's responsibility to 
limit the access that minors 
have to 'indecent and/or 
obscene materials. ' 

tutionally protected images, articles and 
recordings. 

COPA would monitor Web sites 
with sexual content, for example, by 
providing a credit card number or an 
adult access code such as AdultCheck 
(which requires a credit card number to 
secure). This would prevent adults 
without credit cards from accessing 
sexually explicit material on the Inter-
net - a disappointment to countless 
college students. 

Additionally, the high cost of secur-

ing such a security service, which 
according to ACLU, can range from 
$300 to more than $1000, could drive 
many smaller providers out of business 
and thus further limit the material's 
availability to adults. . 

These effects amount to an uncon-
stitutionallimitation of what adults can 
view. It also reveals the bill's support-
ers' true intent: to diminish the prof-
itability and prevalencl; of online 
pornography vendors. They would use 
the government to further their vision 
of a moral society - a use not entitled 
to the government if the means to that 
end infringe upon the Bill of Rights. 

COPA is also overly broad in its def-
inition of material that is "harmful to 
minors." It extends the definition 'from 
material that is "obscene" to anythin'g 
that portrays "an actual or simulated 
normal or perverted sexual act ... a lewd 
exhibition of the genitals or post-
pubescent female breast" or anything 
that "lacks serious literary .. artistic, 
political or scientific value for minors." 

For legislators to attempt to. deter-
·mine what sex acts are "normal" or 
"perverted" is clearly out of line. This 
leeway further reveals the true nature of 
their attempt to police the morals of the 
country. 

Further, what is "lewd" to one may 
be in perfect taste to another. There are 
some who object to pictures of Michae-
langelo's "David" being exposed to 
children. COPA purports to account for 
this by asserting that the standards 
used to judge material should be those 
of "the average person" or the "contem-
porary community." 

However, because of the nature of 
the Web, what would in the end prevail 
are the standards of the most conserva-
tive community with Internet access. It 
is easy to imagine an organization that 
views information about safe sex as 
"patently offensive" (in the bill's lan-
guage) as one that w uld require an 
adult check on PIal)ned Parenthood

ANGELA CARRIER 

ii Ever got the feeling that 
you've been cheated?" Sex 

PiStols singer Johnny Ronen asked 
as he ended a concert. This ques-
tion sums up how life feels some-
times. 

It is the little things in life that 
seem to cheat or disappoint -
like getting a free sample tape of 
Weezer's new album, puttit'lg it in 
the stereo, all pumped up, only to 
find that it is five 20-second snip-
pets ~ jost one big tease. Or like 
running to use the bathroom in 
your apartment only to find that 
there is .no toilet paper left in the 
entire house and running for a 
back-up roll in the laundry room 
and discovering that they are all 
gone, too. Or sitting down on the 
couch to watch some quality 
CNN, only to find that .the lead 
story is about how much the New 
York mayor thinks ferrets are 
dirty, unfit animals to keep as 
pets. These were just the little 
things in one afternoon; the list 
really has no end. 

Maybe those examples are too 
minor and trivial, though . It is 
more like the cheated feeling when 
you write a check to the dreaded 
UC Regents. and then another, and 
another and another. Or when you 
cannot find a single parking space 
even with the $300 parking permit 
you bought , and then you get a 
ticket for parking and paying at a 
meter that expired only minutes 
before you returned to your car. Or 
getting your tax return from the 
State of CalifOrnia for one whop-
ping dollar. Why do they even 
bother? 

Why is it that we obsess with 
the little bothers instead of being 
satisfied with the moments of hap-
piness? Maybe it's because the per-
petually cheerful people's happi-

• ness is more sickening than conta-
gious, and the internally disgrun-
tled people usually seem more 
mysterious ?r interesting. Maybe it 
is just more fun to be overly dra-
matic about linle bothers; they 
bring a little more excitemen t to a 
mundane day. 

But why dwell in the pes-
simistic world that leads only to 
frustration or suicide? How could 
we possibly enjoy the good things 
in life if it weren't for the bad 
things? And anyway, the good 
things really do outweigh the linle 
moments of being cheated; it is 
only that we let them fade from our 
memory too soon. 

Besides, upper-middle-class 
students really don't have much 
to complain about in life. Maybe 
if more people read the New York 
Times best seller "Tuesdays with 
Morrie; there would be a greater 
appreciation for the little things 
in life that make it so good. Or if 
everyone traveled to a third-world 
country for a month and saw 
firsthand how much we are 
spoiled and really just self-cen-
tered idiots. 

But if the feeling of being 
cheated or disappointed persists, it 
can always be diminished with the 
crooning voice of Coldplay's Chris 
Martin, singing "We live in a beau-
tiful world, yes we do, yes we do 
... : And if all else fails, in attempt-
ing to overcome petty disappoint-
ing times, just develop the pictures 
of your friends at the Sun God Fes-
tival.

Plight of Janitors Merits Regents' Attention 
Administration must raise the low wages of deserving UCSD employees 
By JINNIFER SPOSITO 
Copy Editor· 

Harvard University students 
won a victory for low-income 
workers everywhere two weeks 
ago at the end of a three-week sit-
in aiming to draw attention to the 
plight of Harvard employees not 
earning a living wage. 

As a result of the demands of 
students, I.abor unions and politi-
cians, all Harvard workers will 
earn a minimum of $10.25 an 
hour, bringing their pay on par 
with the minimum wage of peo-
ple employed in the city of Cam-
bridge, Mass., that surrounds the 
campus. 

The Harvard situation should 
serve as an example to university 
administrative bodies everywhere. 
The Harvard administration was 
uncharacteristically broadminded 
in its recognition that the federal 
minimum wage is no wage at all 
for those trying to feed and house 
themselves and their families. 

Unfortunately, it seems that 
Harvard's nod to the importance 
of people over corner-cutting can-
not be hoped for from every uni-
versity administration . 

There is no better example to 
illustrate this than the struggle of 
UCSD students and staff to 
obtain a living wage for workers 
on campus. Three weeks ago, the 
work of Movimiento Estudiantil 
Chicana/o de Azt!;in and Justice 
for Janitors toward this goal was 
brought to the forefront of every-
one's attention, 

willing to fight for the changes 
that would rectify this situation. 

It should be obvious to most 
that the University of California's 
bureaucratic administration does 
not put the well-being of its 
workers at the top of its priorities 
list. Take just a moment to look 
around campus at the new con-

struction sites, 
following a wildly 
successful May 
Day concert fea-
turing Ozomatli 
and a march of 
protest. 

UCSD stu-
dents are protest-
ing precisely the 
injustices that 
caused Harvard 
students to com-
mandeer Har-
vard's Massachu-
setts Hall for the 
better part of a 
month . No per-
son in his right 

It should be obvious 
to .most that the 
University of 
California's 
bureaucratic 
administration does 
not put the well-
being of its workers 
at the top of its 
priorities list. 

and you 'll quickly 
realize that the 
thought of gar-
nering money for 
donations is 
responsible for 
the glimmer in 
the eyes of our 
administrators, in 
strict contrast to 
those who, with 
heads bowed , 
ca rry minds 
racked by the IlIr-
moil caused by 
viewing social 
injusti ces take 

mind will acknowledge that a 
wage of just over $6 per hour is 
enough with which to support a 
family. However, it seems th at no 
person in the administration is 

place. 
It is certainly reasonable to 

expect that the university should 
concern itself chiefly with its mis-
sion of teaching and research. But 
when these things are accom-

plished at the expense of others. 
they are worth nothing. 

As the University of California 
is a public school system. it is 
also said that the system cannot 
expect to have enough money at 
its disposal to fund everything as 
fully as it would lih. I respectful-
ly beg to differ. On one 0 casion , 
I have heard of a professor .It 
another UC campus earning OVlT 
$1 70,000 per year. This is not the 
salary of a Nobd laureate or .111 
administrator - it is mlTcly that 
of a professor above scail'. one of 
the higher rankillgs ill the UC 
professor hierarchy. Where is this 
money coming from ? 

I can guarantee YOll that UC 
President Richard Atklllson is not 
taking a pay cut to fund the 11Igh 
sa laries of some professors. Li ke-
wise, he would think It IIlsal1l: tll 
take a pay cut to raise the salam's 
of the people who clean his offi ce. 
However, maybe he shou ld .

Bush Energy Plan a Bright Idea 
President's solution to energy crisis beneficial in the long-run 
By THEODORE DOKKO 
Senior Staff Writer 

Americans were shocked to 
see gasoline prices shoot up to 
$2 per ga llon, and they were 
more shocked to hear tha t those 
pnces Inlght rise to $3 per ga l-
Ion. 

People across the country, 
especially in California, are sub-
ject to rising electricity bi lls and 
,Ire being thre.llcned with poten-
tial blackouts during thc SUIll-
IIllT. 

A fr.lnk ,lsseSSlllcnt of the sit-

I~ III .In cnl'l'gy cnsls. We are pay-
IIlg llIorc and Illorc to fulfi n our 
enagy nceds, Jnd these higher 
prlCcs could vel)' well knock our 
floundering economy into a 
recession. 

While It IS easy for us to pass 
the buck and blame other people 
for this problem, we honestly 
have no one to blame but our-
selves. 

The ad ministratio ns of Bill 
Clinton and George Bush Sr. 
each tu rned a blind eye to our 
energy needs during the com-
bined 12 yea rs of thei r adm inis-
tra tions. During that time. not a 
single oil refinery was built in 
th is country. 

We have neglected to bui ld 
pipelines to deliver gasoline, nat-
ural gas and both crude and 
refined oil to the places where 
these reso urces are needed. At 
the sa me time, we have allowed 
our nati on to become more 
dependent upon fo reign oil and 
kss invt!sted in domestic oi l pro-
duction possibil ities. 

In order to deal wi th this situ-

ation, President George IN. Bush 
recently released a plan with 105 
proposa ls to help alleviate our 
energy woes. The proposals are a 
balanced approach to the crisis 
we face, si nce they deal with both 
th e economi cs of our energy 
needs and th e need fo r the 
encouragement of const!rvation.

President George W 
Bush recently released a 
plan with 105 proposals 
to help alleviate our 
energy woes, .. The 
proposals are a balanced 
approach to the crisis we 
face, 
thing fo r conservation, actually 
seeks to encourage it. 

One of the recommendations 
is fo r the government to raise the 
fuel efficiency standards of sport 
ut ility vehicles from 20 miles per 
ga llon to 27 miles per gallon . 
These effi ciency standards have 
not been changed since the 
Carter administration , when this 
nation was going through anoth -
er energy crisis. 

Another of Bush 's proposals 
would give a tax credit to those 
Americans who decide to buy 
cars that run on alternative ener-
gy, such as electricity. 

All in all, nearly half of the 
105 proposals seek to encourage 

American citizens to conserve 
energy via various incentives and 
government standards. 

On the other hand, it would 
be completely naive to believe 
that this country can crawl out of 
its current state of crisis by sim-
ply conserving. 

We must note that California 
is the most energy-efficient state 
in the union, yet it faces a daunt-
ing summer of rolling blackouts 
that will cause the temporary 
sh utdown of many major busi-
nesses. 

The president 'S plan seeks 
ways to increase our nation's 
energy supply through "common 
se nse" mea ns. This excl udes 
nuclear energy as a possible 
solution, though we haven't con-
sidered such a possibil ity for over 
20 years. 

France, which has not fallen 
victim to an energy crisis, derives 
80 percent of its electricity from 
nuclear energy. It is also impor-
tant to note that the only 
byproduct released into the 
atmosphere from nuclear power 
is steam. 

Democrats are screaming that 
the president is not doing any-
thing to help in the short term. 
They point to previous presi -
dents and say that the current 
administration should follow 
their lead. Their solutions 
include temporarily halting fed-
eral gasoline taxes and releasing 
the strategic oil reserve. 

Such proposals are only tem-
porary fixes that do not address 
our needs. Clinton did not halt 
the federal gas taxes and there is

An Enlightening 
Encounter With Ecstacy 
Drug opens. up doorway to repressed emotions 
By HARRY TAlKER 
Special to the Guardian 

Four days after my first Sun 
God Festival, I find myself still 
involuntarily grinding my teeth in 
recollectio n of th e ecstasy-
induced frenzy I spent a substan-
tial portion of that night in . 

I suppose my (ormer self, the 

me now, but it is a nice change to 
believe that expressing affection is 
desirable and possible. 

"This is a good thing?!" 
replied my friend at UC Santa 
Barbara. [ admit that it very well 
could be a horrible thing. 

There is a fundamental differ-
ence between recreational drug 
use and substance use for emo-

tional enl ighten-high school senior

That former self 
would probably be

emotional changes to. 
my day-to-day life 
that were effected 

ment, and the lat-
ter could very well 
be much more 
dangerous. After 
all , smoking pot a 
couple times -
something [ still 
have not tried -
does not often 
change people's 
political opinions, 
the way they relate 
with others, or the 
way they carry 
themselves in pub-
lic. The most last-
ing consequences 

equal parts 
shocked and 
amused that I had 
my arm curled 
around the person 
to my right, and 
my left hand 
stroking the leg of 
the person to my 
left. 

the first time I tried 
ecstasy '" it is a nice 
change to believe 
that expressing 
affectUm is desirable 
and possible. 

Most galling, 
however, would be the babbling 
stream of honesty that gushed 
forth from my lips. The aloof high 
school senior who regarded 
human interaction as fundamen-
tally flawed, his own desire to 
express affection unwaveringly 
frustrated , and who could not 
stand to touch people had 
become a different person. 

Not only that, but I carry the 
emotional changes to my day-to-
day life that were effected the first 
time [tried cstasy. This is not to 
say I'm touching everyone around 

I've seen are a case 
of the munchies. 

But what if a chemical funda-
mentally changes my perspective 
on human relationships, my own 
self-esteem, even elements of my 
personality? 

The vast majority of the Amer-
ican public would regard this as 
anathema. "This: the barons of 
the DEA would reply, "is exactly 
why we fight against drugs -
because they change the very fab-
ric of good, wholesome people."

Ecstasy:

Continued from page 8 

The U.S. Food and Drug 
Administrations (and the majori ty 
of Americans) place ecstasy on its 
Schedule [V list, a list that bears 
the designation of substances

to disagree. 

Ecstasy, like any other danger-
ous tool, can be both very good and 
very bad - like fire or a knife, you 
can use it to hurt yourself and oth-
ers. But the very fact that some-
thing is powerful and dangerous

very useful tool..

no reason for Bush to do so. 
However, Clinton did release the 
strategic oil reserve, which result-
ed in lower prices. Clearly, that 

• was a mistake. Clinton did not 
understand that the reserve was 
created for real emergencies when 
our national security is at stake -
emergencies such as war. 

Clinton released the reserve 
because he interpreted the si tua-

use here, because it would be hyp-
ocritical and side-stepping the 
issue. 

[ agree that the alterations of 
personalities that drugs can effect 
ca n be very bad. But it seems 
unfortunate that [ cannot tell many 
close fr iends or ordinary people 
about what drug use has helped me 
wi thout their immediate disdain 
and loss of respect. [t is rather 
amusing to me that those who 
would condemn my drug use for 
fee ling closer to others use alcohol 
for the very same purpose. 

The rhetoric of the drug war 
may have saved a great many lives 
fro m heroin addiction or cocai ne 
overdoses. But at the sa me time, 
is it not as harmful that American 
society must deny a drug more 
potentially useful than Prozac due 
to its lasting emotional conse-
quences simply because of thaI 
very potent ial? 

tion as a real emergency. As a 
result, gas prices dropped, only to 
rise again to even higber levels. 

Such quick fixes do nothing to 
address our nation's real needs. In 
addi tion, economic analysts pre-
dict tha t gasoline prices will fall 
after Memorial Day weekend and 
will continue to stabilize without 
th e help of the Strategic Oil 
Reserve. 

Our nation is clearly in the 
throes of al) energy crisis. The 
president has done the right thing 
in re leasing proposals that seek to 
address our long-term needs 
through both conservation and a 
supply increase.

sites, although this informa-
tion is indispensable to minors 
who are or are not sexually 
active. 

The fa ct that the Internet 
transcends geographical bor-
ders also points to another of 
the bill 's weaknesses: It is 
completely ineffective in "pro_ 
tecting" children from sexually 
explici t material because it has 
no jurisdiction over Web sites 
based outside th e Uni ted 
States. 

Pornogra phers can easily 
set up shop in Ca nada, France 
or Singapore and create Web 
si tes wi th myriad portrayals of 
sex acts that would make the 
most lasci vious of libert ines 
blush - and there is noth ing 
our govern ment ca n do about 
it. 

Fu rth ermore, if a credit 
card is all that is requ ired to 
access th ese naughty Web 
sites, there is little to stop a 
prurient-minded 13-ycar-old 
from snatching Mom's Amex 
from her purse when she is not 
paying attention and copying 
the number into his Trapper 
Keeper. 

COPA is not only unconsti-
tu tional, it 's ineffective, and 
the Supreme Court should do 
its duty to uphold the consti -
tu tion and strike down this act 

once and for all in Octobl'r. 
Of course, underlying this 

issue is the question of what 
exactly is "harm ful to minors." 
The legis lators wh o draftl'd 
CO PA think th ey know, but 
the ACLU po in ted out that 
what is ha rm ful to a 5-year-old 
may not be to an older minor. 
However, the whole idea that 
sexual images and descrip tions 
are actually psychologically 
damaging to children reveals 
America's inescapable sl'xua l 
Puritanism. 

Unquestio nably, there are 
so me disturbing materi als on 
th e Web, telev ision, th e 
evening news, in the movies, 
and in the N~w York Times, but 
is looking at Playboy.com goi ng 
to scar little Johnny fo r li fe? It 
is a possibility, but the adviso-
ry board for the draft ing of 
COPA did not include devel-
opmental psychologists to tell 
us exactly how sex "harms" 
America's children . 

What is truly harmful to our 
nation is the idea that the gov-
ernment is responsib le for par-
enting our children and polic-
ing our thoughts and desires. 
The industry has developed 
software such as NetNanny, 
which blocks sexually explicit 
material wi thout infringi ng on 
the consti tutiona l righ t of 
adults to peruse sexual material 
on the Internet. 

Porn ograp hy may not be 
everyone's cup of lca, but the 
government quite clea rly has 
no right to impose itself as a 
moral regulator.

Budget: 
FallFest will get altrWst as 
much money as Sun God 
Continued from ..... 1 
Dodge said on his decision to 
drop the CWD as a line-item allo-
cation. "There are over 300 stu-
dent organizations on campus 
and CWD was getting a line item. 
This is no reflection on the quali-
ty of their work; it 's a matter of 
fairness and eq uality. We ca nnot 
fund one organization over oth-
ers." 

Also of in terest to students is 
an allocation within the area of 
Campus Activity Fees Allocations 
for Athletic Relations. This is the 
first time ath letics have been 
funded by the A.S. Council, and 
the intention is to allow ath letics 
to generate more student support 
and attract people to sports com-
petitions. 

The $1,600 allocation will pos-
sibly gain a larger budget in the 
futu re depending on the success 
of this alloca tion next year. 

"The difference it could possi-
bly make Iwill be seen] during fall 
quarter," Dodge said. "It's a trial-
and-error situation." 

Also under the umbrella of 
Campus Activity Fees 
Appropriations, the new budget 
doubles the funds spent on FallFest 
from $35,000 to $70,000, which 
Dodge hopes will invigorate stu-
dent life at the beginning f the 
year much like Sun God does in 
spring. 

The allocation for Fall Fest is 
now only $5,000 less than that of 
Sun God, meaning that, as Dodge 
put it, "FaliFest is going to be big 
next year." 

Under the programming line-
item, an increase in spending on 
"Nooners" - up to $20,000 from 
last year's $8,000 - is meant to 
improve the student experience at 
UCSD.

Researchers Debunk Placebo 
DENMARK - In a new report 

that is b~ing met with a mixture of 
astonishment and, sometimes, dis-

~Iit:f, two Danish researchers say 
that the placebo effect is a myth. 

The investigators analYLed 114 
published studies involving about 
7,500 patients with 40 different 
conditions. They found no support 
for the common notion that, in 
general. about a third of patients 
will improve if they are given a 
dummy pill and told it is real. 

Instead, they theorize, patients

Hrobjartsson and Dr. Peter C. 
Gotzsche, are with the University 
of Copenhagen and the Nordic 
Cochran Center, an international 
organization of medical 
researchers who review random-
ized clinical trials 

Hrobjartsson said he has been 
telling investigators what he found 
and watching their responses. 

"People react with surprise, but 
also with a kind of satisfaction. 
They start reflecting," he said in a 
telephone interview. Experts inter-
viewed this week had responses 
ranging from ready acceptance of 
the conclusion, to great surprise, 
to a skepticism and the desire to 
see the details of the analysis. 

Dr. Donald Berry, for example, 
a statistician at the M.D. Anderson 
Cancer Center in Houston, said: "I 
believe it. In fact, I have long 
believed that the placebo effect is 
nothing more than a regression

Such genetic manipulation has

for J varie ty of reasons, including· 
the possibility of harm to the envi-

principle to what they sec as unac-
ceptable tamperi ng with nature. 

Managers of the 7 JOO-acre 
regon tree farm said they do not 

create or grow genetically engi-
neered-trces there, but a company 
that once owned the property was 
affiliated with a ul11versity-based 
group called the Poplar Molecular

statistical observation that a 
patient who feels particularly terri-
ble one day will almost invariably 
feel better the next day, no matter 
what is done for them. 

But others, like David 
Freedman, a statistician at the UC 
Berkeley, said h~ is ·not convinced. 
He said that the statistical method 
the Danish researchers used, pool-
ing dar.1 from many studies and 
using a statistical tool ca lled meta-
analysis to analyze them, can give 
resul ts that are misleading. 

"I just don 't find this report to 
be incredibly persuasive," 
Freedman said. "The evidence of a 
placebo effect is maybe a little bit 
less than I thought it was, but , 
think there's a big effect in many 
circumstances. This doesn't change 
my mind."

through the revenues of A.S.

Most noticeable are the addi-
tions of funding for the A.S. 
Outreach Program, the Excel 
Leadership Conference and the 
A.S. Women's Commission. 

The A.S. Outreach Program will 
receive a $5,000 allocation and is 
considered by the A.S. Council to 
be a very important program for 
the future of UCSD. 

The program runs an Outreach

ASOP also gives away two 
$500 scholarships every year for 
undergraduates who work to sig-
nificantly improve outreach at 
UCSD. 

The A.S. Women 's

Smith agrees that professors and 
TAs are better able to detect uncit-
ed work using the turn itin.com. 

"Five or six cases of plagiarism 
were detected in the last quarter's 
lecture track: Smith said, "This is 
high, There are usually two or 
three." 

One of the main objectives of 
using the service is to deter stu-
dents from using uncited materials 
in the first place. 

Aguilar said that with the vast 
resources ava ilable online, the 
temptation to use somebody else's 
work is becoming greater. 

"With the Internet, convenience 
and accessibility are increased," he 
sa id. "Cut-and-paste is so conve-
nient that it is easy to forget to cite 
a source, It ', much quicker than, 
going to the library and going from

A.S. Lecture Notes revenues. 
Dodge said this $5,000 alloca-

tion "is a step tbwards making 
that conference really important 
on cam pus." 

The KSDT-SRTV split also had 
an impact on next year's A.S. bud-
get, with funds for each being allo-
cated separately rather than 
together under Student Cable 
Works. 

KSDT will no longer be broad-
casting through cable radio or 
through its low-power AM recep-
tors. Instead, the radio station will 
broadcast entirely over the 
Internet, saving the A.S. Council 
$300 per month that has usually 
been used for station upkeep. 

As a result of the split, SRTV 
will now be individually funded by 
an allocation of $5,098. 

Triton Taxi will now be funded 
by A.S. Lecture Notes income as 
well , freeing up $11 ,000 for cam-
pus activities. 

Other changes include the 
allocations for University of 
California Student Association 
membership and United States 
Student Association membership. 
These actions were passed in the 
A.S. elections held in April and 
will cost a total of $0.50 per stu-
dent per quarter, with $0.45 going 
toward UCSA membership and 
$0.05 going toward USSA mem-
bership. 

"[Membership in the USSt\l 
gives the university and ASUCSD a 
connection to movements going 
on outside of the campus and 
allows for all schools to b a part of

Dodge said. 

After the budget was approved, 
A.S. Vice President Internal 
jennifer Brown commented on 
how quickly the budget was 
approved. 

"I would just like to say that we

A.S. President Jeff Dodge added, 
"That's the fastest it's been in four 
years." 

this quarter, said he thinks that stu-
dents are better off with their class-
es' use of turnitin.com. 

"The biggest hope is that this will 
be a deterrent," he said. "If students 
know this kind of thing is being 
used, they will have incentive not to 
plagiarize. This is good for them." 

Roosevelt sophomore Farrah 
Abrishami, who is currently taking 
MMW 6, said she believes that the 
use of the site wi ll be a deterrent 
because it makes using uncited 
sources from the Internet more 
risky. 

"I don 't know how to beat the 
system, though I'm sure some peo-
ple will ," Abrish-ami said. "But risk-
ing an F and possibly getting kicked 
out of school - most people won't 
risk it. , definitely think it will deter 
people Ifrom plagiarizingl." 

Still, using turnitin.com will not 
erase the problem of plagiarism at 
UCSD, though it may help to alle-
viate it by both detection and by 
deterrence.

reactive mode, only punishing

UCSD Honors Staff at 
Service Award Ceremony 
Chancellor Dynes receives surprise 
service award for 10 years at UCSD 
By STEVE LEHTONEN 
Staff Writer 

UCSD held its 34th annual 
Service Award Ceremony in the 
Price Center Ballroom on 
Tuesday. The ceremony honored 
university staff who have worked at 
UCSD from 10 years to 35 years. 
Friends and family of th05e hon-
ored gathered to recognize the 
work of longtime UCSD staff. 

Assistant Vice Chancellor of 
Human Resources Rogers Davis 
opened the ceremony with wel-
coming remarks. 

Davis asked for applause to 
recognize UCSD's committment 
to honoring their staff for the past 
34 yeaR;. 

"The university deems you 
important," Davis said to the 
guests. 

Chancellor Robert C. Dynes 
also gave greetin~s and opening 
remarks. Dynes said he was elated 
by the large number of honored

staff at the ceremony. 
"This year's ceremony is special 

for a couple of reasons," Dynes said. 
"First, we have a record number of 
honorees this year. There are eight 
staff members who have served 35 
years. You've built this place." 

The crowd greeted his remarks 
with applause. Dynes then men-
tioned his personal connection to 
the event. Dynes also received an 
award for 1 0 years of service to 
UCSD. He joked about his love of 
San Diego. 

"' moved here from New jersey 
to become a professor of physics," 
Dynes said, "What a change." 

Davis then surprised Dynes 
with a special 1 O-year award signed 
by UC President Richard C. 
Atkinson. 

Dynes, who normally shakes the 
hands of honorees, joked, "I guess 
this means I get to shake my own 
hand."

of Biology, was honored for her 35

described the audience as "atten-

definitely looking at us with inter-

Maas said he supports the 
actions of the SEj members and 
that he believes that the group's 
presence at the Chancellor's 
Associates meeting was necessary 
in order to make their point. 

years of service. Turner expressed 
her feelings about working at the 
university for the past four decades. 

"Most of my career has been in 
biology," Turner said. "It really has 
been a truly awesome experience, 
not only at the university but in 
biology. It's an honor to be a staff 
member here." 

Lucinda Rubio-Barrick, from 
the literature department, was rec-
ognized for 30 years of service but 
was unable to attend. Barrick was 
appreciative of the university'S 
acknowledgment. 

"It's nice that the university rec-
ognizes landmarks," Barrick said 
later. 

Those serving 25, 30 or 35 years 
received a spCClal paperwei~ht, a 
framed certificate and a picture 
with the chancellor. All other hon-
orees received a certificate of 
appreciation. 

There were 567 honorees serv-
ing 10 years. That number is 139 
more than last year. 

"I feel that this was the appro-
priate action to take," Maas said. 
"The same issues and problems 
that the janitors are facing now 
happened here two years ago. I 
believe being here today made 
sure that our point was heard ." 

Members of SEj offered Dynes 
the date of Wednesday, May 30 as 
the last day for him to offer a 
response to their demands.

Oakenfold Rocks EMF 
World famous OJs and ·Iocal favorites appear 
at the Electronica Music Festival for an 
evening ' of dancing 
By JOSEPH LEE 
Hiatus Editor 

San Diego is not known as the bastion 
of so-called "rave" cul ture. There aren't 
very many clubs that cater to big-name 
Djs, and finding a massive - a party on a 
gargantuan sca le - out in the middle of 
the; San Diego countryside is a bit of a has-
sle. 

UCSD prevents the Djs and Vinyl-
philes Club from organizing an event such 
as last year's "Movement, " which flooded 
the Price Center with wonderful music 
and colorful people. 

So it was flice, for once, to head down to 
the San Diego Sports Arena for the Elec-
tronica Music Festival , rather than to make 
my wa.::; tp, say, Indio to find a comparable 
line-up. 
_ Settled in the concourse of the Sports 
Arena were two areas of kickin' breaks and 
deep ho'use. In the Main Concourse area, 
Barry Weaver, Nigel Richards and local OJ 
jon Bishop entertained a small crowd of 
people sweating and grooving to the 
music. 

Downstairs in the House Arena, Angel 
Alanis and jon Williams kept the dancers 
alive with hard-hitting house-and techno. 

But the two main stages were where all 
the people were. On the floor of the Sports 
Arena, thousands of revelers were waving 
their glow sticks and struggling for room to 
dance. 

Main Stage 2 catered to those who know 
and love Moonshine Records. Veteran OJ 
Donald Gluade and labelmates john Kelley 
and Dave Aude played to a patked crowd 
that was jumping and shouting at every 
break and every snyth line. 

Main Stage 1 had the names that most 
casual fans of electronica would know. 
VonShock, Taylor and Mark Lewis 
pumped up the crowd with their eclectic 
sounds of progressive house and trance. 

But as 1 a.m. approached, the dance 
floor became more difficult to navigate; it 
came time for the world-famous Paul Oak-
enfold to take his place behind the decks. 
Appearing in a polka-dot shirt, Oaken fold 
made his way onto the elevated stage and 
extended his arms out to the crowd before 
clutching his heart in appreciation as candy 
ravers and casual ravers alike erupted into 
cheers. 

Oakenfold 's resume is impressive: He 
has performed in places such as Liverpool. 
England's superclub Cream, dropped mind-
expanding tracks in Ibiza and even opened 
for U2. 

Oaken fold is no stranger to the West 
Coast, eithe. y playing massives last sum-
mer in Sou th ern California and more 
recently at Coachella and San Diego's Club 
Montage, Oaken fold is definitely trying to 
stake his claim here in the West Coast music 
scene. 

While the first hour of his two-hour sct 
wasn't very impressive, Oakenfold picked 
things lip in his second h ur on stage. 

The god-like influence of Oakenfold 
became apparent as he pulled th.e crowd in 
closer wilh each bass line and drum beat. 
Then, in classic Oakenfold fashion , he 
dropped in a couple of vocal tracks and 
closed his set with thick layers of trancc-
synths that directed dancers into a fren zy. 

Before the audience realized what had 
hit, Oakenfold' was done, but Dave Ralph 
picked lip the pace and energy of Oaken fold 
and rocked the crowd until the very end, at 
4 a.m. 

Watching the throngs of people actually 
dancing until the end was magical. 

And as you stumbled out of the Spons 
Arena and waded through the flyers for 
the next party, your only regret was thaI 
Oakenfold didn't play longer, and your 
only hope was that San Diego will host 
more events like the Electronica Music 
Festival.

Swing: 
Scene lxmzes from neo-
swingfad ofmid-'90s 
Continued from page 10 
underground. One of the most 
vibrant forms of swing just hap-
pens to have the strongest presence 
right here in San Diego. What 
could I be talking about, other than 
lhat unabashedly joyful dance with 
its constant eight-count rhythmic 
pulse flowing to the music of the 
'30s, '40s and '50s? Lindy hop . 

This original swing dance of the 
'20s began at the famed Savoy Ball-
room in Harlem, N.Y. Although 
lindy hop existed before the open-
ing of the club, it was not until 
dancers such as "Shorty Georg~ " 
Snowden, Leroy "Stretch" Jones 
and the legendary Frankie Man-
ning revolutionized the scene that 
the dance really began to soar. 
Snowden is often credited for nam-
ing lindy hop after Charles lind-
bergh's triumphant 1927 "hop" 
across the Atlantic. 

According to myth, shortly after 
Lindbergh's famous transatlantic 
flight , New York City hosted a char-
ity dance marathon . Among the 
many people in attendance that day 
was Snowden. After seeing Snow-
den performing an eye-popping 
maneuver, a reponer covering the 
event asked him, "What was that?" 
to which the dancer replied, "The 
lindy hop." The rest is history. 

One fundamental th ing to 
remember about swing is that there 
are distinctions between the differ· 
ent dances. By now, most people 
are probably familiar with the 
terms West <;:oast and East Coast

swing. A myriad of other styles 
exisls - far too many to list. At the 
risk of making too gross a- general-
ization, all other forms of swing 
dancing are simply variations on 
lindy hop, since it was the original 
swing dance. 

San Diego's current lindy scene 
traces its origins directly from the 
neo-swing fad of the mid '90s. 
Swing had always been around, but 
you would be more likely to find 
your grandfather carrying on the 
tradition instead of your donnmate. 

The dramatic resurgence of 
youth in the culture did not occur 
until after the media embraced 
swing. Before you knew it, swing 
was everywhere - on television , in 
the movies, even in clothing. 

Clubs existed in San Diego, 

most notably the rockabilly club 
Tio Leo's, but ones that were lindy-
friend ly were either rare or nonexis-
tent. ot until the effons of two 
pioneer dancers - Johnny Lloyd 
and Lisa Conway - did the lindy 
scene in San Diego take flight in the 
late '90s. Following their' lead were 
other prominent instructors who 
cranked out even ttlOre dancers. 

Among these teachers were the 
self-proclaimed "swing jack of all 
trades· Meeshi Sumayao; instruc-
tors and current managers of the 
Rocket swing club Jim Cruzen and 
Margie Adams; and UCSD's very 
own distinguished recreation class 
instructors, Tan Huynh and Valerie 
Yau.

Swing: 
Dancing styles vary in 
San Diego 's nightlife 
Continued from .,..e 12 

In many ways, UCSD has 
played a large part since the 
beginning in contributing to San 
Diego's lindy co.mmunity. The rec. 
classes constantly feed dancers 
into the scene. Indeed, on any 
given night, the majority of people 
in one of San Diego'S many swing 
clups is often made up of UCSD 
students. 

Presenlly, the swing scene in 
San Diego remains sma ll but 
loyal. So loyal, in fact, lhat the 
dedicated ones would never let 
swing die. Most local lindy hop-

per~ are in their late 20s to mid-
30s. 

Unlike other cities that serve 
alcohol at swing clubs, San Dit:go 
typically does not. The reason is 
not hard to figure out. Dancing 
while drunk, especially to some-
thing as challenging as lindy, is 
dangerous. Practically every dancer 
knows this and prefers to remain 
sober on the dance floor. 

The -vast majority of the city's 
venues arc sponsored by dancers 
instead of bars, making big-lime 
marketing an impossibility. This 
may explain why swing has become 
such an underground culture . 

The UCSD Guardian 

Unlike San Francisco and Los 
Angeles, San Diego has a more 
diverse mix of music and style. 
The City by the Bay is known tra-
ditionally for its slower tempos. 
Los Angeles, by contrast, is 
famous for its fast and frenetic 
rhythms. San Diego's music varies 
greatly from fast to slow, allowing 
dancers of all levels of expertise to 
enjoy the experience. This is 
unique to our city.

As any avid lindy hopper can 
tell you, learnin~ how to swing 
dance in a class IS only scratch· 
ing the surface. In order to 
practice your moves and get a 
real feel for the scene, every 
dancer must go OUt to a swing 
club. 

There are no excuses. Lindy 
hop is a social dance. Luckily, 
San Diego is home to some of 
the best and most innovative 
clubs this side of the Pacific.

day of the week, beginner and 
advanced dancers alike have all 
the more reason to venture out

Brotherly Love: The Black Crowes and Oasis Swing: Scene has grown frmn bars to underground clubs 
Continued from page 13 

Newlywed Chris Robinson 
and The Black Crowes performed 
May 14 at the Greek Theatre as 
part of the Brotherly Love Tour 
that also featured dueling broth-
ers Liam and Noel Gallagher, of 
Oasis. 

Though Oasis struggled to 

gain the acceptance of the crowd, 
the Robinson brothers stole (he 
night, which ended with a cover 
of "To Love Somebody" . with 
Noel and Joan Osborne. 

The Black Crowes performed 
new songs like "Midnight From 
the Inside Out; "Greasy Grass 

River" and "Cosmic Friend: as 
well as hits like "Twice as Hard" 
and "Sting Me: 

Oasis opened with "Go Let it 
Out" and closed with a cover of 
The Beatles' "I am the Walrus" and 
included hits like "Don't Look 
Back in Anger; "Morning Glory" 

and "Champagne Supernova." 
Oasis is working on a follow-

up to "Standing on the Shoulder 
of Giants" and The Black Crowes 
have a new album in stores titled 
"Lions." 

- Story and photos by 
Brian Moghadam 

did not embrace dancing at all- its 
participants chose instead simply to 
dress up and go out, manini in 
hand, mingling old '40s style. 

owadays, while some dancers 
still get dressed up and play on all 
of swing's nostalgia, the opposite is 
usually more common. The : ur-
rent scene in San Diego is far more 
laid back. 

Over the years, the swing scene 
has made a progression from bars, 
where people dressed up in vintage 
outfits, · to today's underground 
clubs, where comfonable attire is 
preferred. 

Without all the frills, dancers 
today choose to focus more on the 
dance alone. The emphasis is on 
feeling the music and connecting 
with one's partner. Everything else 
is just details. 

On ly a few dancers ever get 
beyond the beginner's hump, but 
those who do rna ter the basic steps 
eventually stick with it. Dancers 
often remark on how they like the 
dance for its complexity and athleti-
cism. 

Of course, there's also the social 
aspect. Few dances are as playful but 
at the same time as complicated as 
lindy hop. Some liken it to playing 
chess with a panner. 

Another interesting feature of 
modern Iindy is its many influ-
ences. Lindy hoppers like to spice 
things up by incorporating other 
dances, including Latin , tap, jazz 
and hip-hop. 

Although not as visible as it 
once was, the swing scene in San 
DiegG conti nues to resonate. Most 
lindy hoppers are certain of one 
thing - while it is true that fads 
come and go, swing will continue 
to live and evolve. p------- ..

- Although this movie may seem 
like a pathetic attempt to employ 
an attractive Australian hunk as a 
knight in shining armor, "A 
Knight's Tale" is a surprisingly 
good film about courage and 
social rebellion in the Middle 
Ages. 

Heath Ledger plays the lead 
character, William Thatcher, an 
English squire determined to 
become a knight who does so by 
fooling the French nobility. 

The movie revolves around 
tournaments and · jousting, the 
sport in which two men on 

hors~back tun at each other with 
huge wooden sticks and try to 
knock each other down, in case 

you didn't know. 
It is through these tourna-

ments that Thatcher gains popu-
larity and comes into contact with 
his enemy Count Adhemar, 
played by Rufus Sewell. Both 
actors are exemplary as they play 
two men motivated by their com-
petitive spirit. 

Newcomer Shannyn Sossa-
mon plays Jocelyn, the object of 
both men's affection. Although 
completely unheard of before this 
film , Sossamon plays her role with 
realism. 

The noteworthy supporting 
cast also adds humor and vitality 
to a surprisingly humorous and 
modern take on medieval times. 

The UCSD Guardian 

Although the story is a bit con-
trived, it is a great combination of 
modern pop music with everlast-
ing themes of courage, love and 
honor. • 

The impressive horsemanship 
and sportsmanship in this movie 
make it appealing to males as well 
as females, for obvious reasons. 

Ledger, unlike many other 
Hollywood- hunks, can actually 
act, and his skill makes this film 
realistic and human. 

This movie is great if you want 
to see an entertaining film with a 
respectable degree of depth. It will 
keep you entertained and thor-
oughly satisfied.

Weezer 
"Weezer" 

Geffen 
A 

Though the album appears 
plain, decked in green and simply 
titled "The Green Album; Weez-
er's new and long-overdue record 
is anything but ordinary. Rising out 
of bed from an extensive hiatus, 
frontman Rivers Cuomo drives the 
reins of his geeky-metal band with 
a heavy snap. 

About five years have passed 
since Weezer's last outing, the 
commercial flop but critically 
acclaimed "Pinkerton: Its sporadic 
sound and haunting lyrics were a 
far cry from their original, platinum 
debut aptly titled "The Blue 
Album: which spawned such hits 
as "Buddy Holly" and "Undone 
(The Sweater Song) ." 

"The Green Album" effectively 
melds both records together, creat-
ing melodies appropriate enough 

HIATUS 15 

for commercial pop and with 
words to please analytical critics. 

Cuomo continues to croon over 
girl troubles in "0 Girlfriend:· as 
open chords serve only as backup 
to his weeping voice. Lyrically sim-
plistic and slightly cliched, songs 
like "0 Girlfriend" and "Smile" 
show that "The Green Album " 
lacks the emotional punch llf 
"Pinkerton." But still, the albulll is 
adorned with catchy power chords 
and easily digestible riffs that hook 
you onto d slew of dork)' punk 
tunes. 

The songs are more cOl11pkx 
than your average bra nd of plink , 
sliding bcrIVeen hammering notes 
and gentle rhythms. Tracks sllch as 
"Crab" lie in the gray area between 
simplicity and psychedelia with 
wah-distoned guitar nuggets and 
repeated vocals. 

Cuomo's compatriots, guitarist 
Brian Bell , bassist Mikey Welsh and 
drummer Patrick Wilson , complete 
the barbershop quartet , singing 
background vocals. The four belt 
out the "whoaaa-woooas" and "hey 
heys." The songs wouldn't be the 
same without their choral roles, 
which are reminiscent of early 
Beach Boys songs. 

Reminiscent, yes, but still origi-
nal and true, Weezer continue to 
rock in an alternative era most crit-
ics deem dead and most companies 
claim unmarketable to the new 
century's audience. 

Weezer is a breath of fresh 
musical air to everything else 
around and should be welcomed 
back with open arms and ears.

same as everybody else makes one 
wonder if this is how the world was 
supposed to be. Was this sense of 
equality and fairness ever found 
within our society? 

Of course, you and I both know 
that sports aren't always fair. Look 
at the Yankees' payroll , for 
instance. Or the shoebox the 
Astros call a stadium, or Alex 
Rodriguez's contract. 

But these are instances not 
where sports have failed, but where 
society has crept into athletics and 
sullied its reputation. The intrusion 
of business into sports has begun 
to poison them. 

But the erosion of any beautiful 
thing cannot happen too quickly, 
and when two teams strive to 
defeat each other today, one retains 
a sense of justice that is hard to 
find anywhere else. 

. So there are all the people who 
u~e sports to escape the life's some-
times-cruel reality and can witness 
a spectacle of fair play. justice and 
heroes. 

Last but not least, there are 
poor suckers like me who simply 
weren 't good enough to keep play-
ing and have to settle for writing 
about sports.

Warrington said. "We didn't end up 
making it, but it was a good way to 
end the year. I caught all four of 
those games in two days. Catching 
four games in two days is rare for a 
catcher." 

O'Brien maintains a positive 
outlook on the upcoming season. 

"Next year we will have a very 
solid recruiting.c1ass: O'Brien said. 
"There will be 10 returning juniors, 
so we expect them to provide 
strong leadership. We are also get-
ting transfer players from solid 
ijunior collegel programs as well as 
high school players who have a lot 
of potentia l. We win-definitely miss 
these seniors; these guys have been 
with me since the beginning of my 
career. But we are excited about 
next year."

"She brought enthusiasm," 
Gerckens said. "She brought power 
to the plate from the left side. She 
had heart: 

Vorsatz brought hustle every 
time she stepped onto the dia-
mond, playing first base 'and in the 
outfield. Playing sparingly, she 
drove in six batters and scored nine 
runs in only 51 at bats. 

UKim was someone who would 
run through a wall for you," Gerck-
ens said. "She pJ!.sQed herself and 
was there to push her teammates. 
She worked her tail off. She made 
plays." 

Cordero, who played third base, 
was clearly a team leader. She bat-
ted .287 with a slugging percentage 
of .392. She connected with 41 
hits, scored 18 runs and had 56 
total bases. Cordero's skills at the 
hot corner earned her all California 
Co ll egiate Athletic Association 
honors. 

"[She is l one of the toughest

Six· Baseball Players Leaving 
Graduation beckons stellar seniors 
By ARYIND VASAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

Six veterans of the men's base-
ball team will be leaving Triton 
Field as they prepare for life 
beyond the friendly confines of 
UCSD. 

By ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

In sports lore, there is often talk 
of "the boys of summer: This of 
course refers to baseball players 
who gruel through a long season 
during the hot months. 

Well, how about the "girls of 
spring?" This refers to college soft-
ball players. 

UCSD is home to some of the 
top softball players around, and,

Why Do 
Peeps Dig 
Sports? 

Stoner 
Steps 

ISAAC PEARLMAN 

Someone recently asked me, upon learning of my current profession, why people like 
sports so much . 

I replied defensively that there 
are a lot of n:asons for people to like 
sportS. which they immediately saw 
as a way to stall for time to think. 
Which I did ... for a long time. 

Why are people so fascina ted 
with a simple game? What is it 
about a bunch of adults playing 
haphazardly with variously sized 
objects that could possess others 
to shoul. scream, fight and weep? 

To hdp answer this question. I 
thought of the different types of 
people who follow sports. 

There are the ex-athletes who 
watch sports to rclive their glory 
days and who Sit with a beer in 
ha'nd and start evety conversation 
wnh, "I remember back when I 
used to play .... " 

There are the never-were athletes 
who wished they had played when 
they were young but didn't. So now 
they settle for memorizing countless 
trivial facts in an anempt to cover fo r 
the fact that they never had enough 
coordination to play sportS. 

There are the guys who don't 
know crap about sports and just 
follow It because in this society it's 
expected for guys to know and like 
sports. 

There are guys who just watch 
in hopes of getting a glimpse of the 
cheerleaders. 

There are girls who watch 
sports only because they think a 
certain athlete is cute. 

The list goes on. There are fa t 
people. skinny people, short. tall, 
ugly, pretty, old, young - evety 
type of person imaginable. 

So upon reflection, I concluded 
that there actually were a lot of rea-
sons why people like sports. Evety 
type of person has a different rea-
son for liking athletics. So that got 
me wondering why America as a 
society is so attracted to spons? 

After several more hours of 
reflection , I came to the epiphany 
that the reason is the simple ele-
gance of athletics. With life becom-
ing increasingly complex, there is a 
comfort in knowing that the 
dynamics of sports will never 
change. 

Athletics will certainly evolve as 
players become better and new 
strategies are developed, but the 
boundaries will remain the same. It 
is these boundaries, these simple 
rules that are so attractive in a world 
filled with millions of rules that are 
ignored, broken, bent, reversed and 
amended in life evety day. 

But while the world we live in 
isn't always fair, the world existing 
between the two foul lines has one 
set of rules that everyone must 
adhere to no maner how much 
money you make, how pretty or 
how popular you are. 

And while these types of people 
can get around the rules in today's 
society, witnessing an athletic 
event in which they are treated the

Asociate Sports Editor 

Current Surf Club President 
Keith Eshelman didn 't even vol-
untarily join the surf club his 
freshman year. 

"During my freshman year, 
some of the older officers grabbed 
me and one of the other officers, 
Charlie Paynter [next year's presi-
dentl , and got us involved. We 
have been part of the organization 
ever since," Eshelman said. 

Since his first year, Eshelman 
has risen from performing menial 
tasks like calling memb rs to 
inform them of events to running 
the club, which, at 214 paying 
members, stands as one of the 
biggest clubs on campus. During 
his ascension to the top, Eshelman 
has noticed a definite change in 
the Surf Club's operations. 

"One of the major improve-
ments since I first started hrlping 
out was the access we have 
gained from the Internet." Eshel-
man said. "We used to have to 
call all the members and tell 
them individually what events 
were coming up when . I ow we 
just poi nt and click, and about 
300 people know what's going 
on. Also, the membership has 
expa nded considerably over the 
past yea rs be~ause we sit on 
Library Walk for the firs t week of 
school and rally troops to join 
the club and get a free shirt and 
other free stuff." 

Eshelman shares his duties 
with Paynter, james Styles, Stewart 
Hindley and Ryan Matlow. all of 
whom comprise the "Gurth Man-
agement," or officers. of the 
UCS D Surf Club. 

The club hosts several events 
throughout the year, including the 
annual Fall Classic. 

"[The Fall Classici is the 
biggest contest of the year. The 
sponsors are amped on it and give 
us a lot of products to give away as 
prizes," Eshelman sa id. "The 
turnout is usually good ·and the 
fina l round is always fun to watch 
because the surfing level is usually 
pretty high." 

In addition to the Fall Classic, 
the surf club also sponsors Learn 
to Surf days, in which they initiate 
beginning surfers and teach them 
surfing fundamentals. 

"We do the Learn to Surf days 
at La jolla Shores, which has been 
a huge success," Eshelman said. 
"Only one out of about 7S people 

wasn 't able to stand up and ride a 
wave. But otherwise evetyope got 
up and rode a wave, which is cool 
to see because of the exhilaration 
people experience when they surf 
for the first time." 

Although Eshelman won't be 
president next year, his goals for 
next year's surf club incl ude 
putting on more events. 

"My goals are for the club to 
cantin ue to have some sort of an 
event every two weeks or so like 

we have done this year," he said. 
"It gets a lot of people together 
that would have never been able 
to meet. Also, I want Charlie, next 
year's president, to have more 
parties and lots of drinking activi-
ties." 

While surfing is the main con-
centration of the club, there is also a 
social aspect that separates the Surf 
Club from sport clubs. The Surf 
Club puts on many social events. 
The club's next planned event is its

semiformal on june 2. 
"[It I will no doubt be off the 

hook with sick Djs, lots of danc-
ing, and of course the essential 
ingredients: lots of booze and 
Team Gurth in its element," 
Eshelman said. 

Anyone interested in taking up 
surfing is encouraged to join the 
surf club. 

"It has been a great way to meet 
the surfing culture at UCSD," 
Eshelman said. 

UCSD Has a Cycling Champion 
Pete Knudsen is crowned tops at event in Colorado - -
By JASON GOLDBERG 
Special to the Guardian 

UCSD has a new national 
champion in its ranks: Peter Knud-
sen, who proved that dedication 
and hard work payoff by becoming 
the U.S. collegiate road cycling 
champion this weekend at the Col-
legiate Nationals Road Champi-
onships in Colorado Springs, Colo. 

The three-day event, held May 
19 through May 21, consists of a 
criterium, a road race and a team 
time trial, held on consecutive 

days. Only the ' first two events 
count toward the individual over-
all championship. 

In the criterium, art event run 
with multiple laps of a 0.9-mile 
circuit that typically favors sprint-
ers, Knudsen made a decisive 
move with more than 30 minutes 
remaining in the approximately 
SO-minute event. Only one other 
rider, Mark Ernsting from Mid-
western State University, was able 
to move with him. 

In the finish, Knudsen, not 
known for his sprinting, wisely 

tried to escape the MSU rider:with 
two laps to go, but could not break 
free and got silver. 

"If I had more oxygen, it would 
have been better, but it was a 
tough day," Knudsen said. "I tried 
to attack at the end but it was a lit-
tle early, and I have no sprint. The 
sprint is not for me, so I knew if I 
could get a good gap and peel off I 
had a chance, but [Ernsting is] a 
good rider. This is an individual 
event and even the best teams only 
have one strong rider, so riding 
alone wasn't a challenge for me.· 

The Sunday road race was on a 
hilly course that was further 
toughened by its high elevation on 
the Air Force Academy campus. 

With his tremendous placing in 
the previous day's criterium and 
the excellent finish in the road race, 
Knudsen garnered enough points 
to win the Stars and Stripes jersey, 
signifying the overall national 
championship title winner. 

Knudsen, a junior, has ridden 
on the cycling team since he came 
to UCSD. This year he turned his 
full attention to road cycling.
