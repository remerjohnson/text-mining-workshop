Fired dean sues 
UCSD, others 
for $6 million 
By CHRIS HAMSt>N 

Fired Third College Dean Bev-
erly Varga alleges in a lawsuit 
that UCSD officials "conspired 
to oust her," and is suing for $6 
million in damages. 

In her lawsuit filed Oct. 19 in 
San Diego Superior Court Varga 
alleges that her superiors con-
spired to fire her because she 
embarrassed the university by 
clearing student activist Russel 
Andalcio of charges brought 
against him by the university 
police. 

Varga also claims in the law-
suit that Third College Provost 
Faustina Solis harrassed her and 
plotted to fire her after Varga 
confronted Solis about Solis' al-
leged homosexual advances to 
and sexual harassment offemale ' 
staff and students. 

Varga was -termi-nated . in 
November of 1986 after an 
administration investigation 
charged her with mismanagement 
of funds and lack of student and 
staff support, according to a 
Guardian article. 

Third provost Faustina Solis 
The lawsuit alleges that Chan-

cellor Richard Atkinson and vice 
chancellor of undergraduate af-
fairs Joseph Watson, among 
others, were part of the "conspi-
racy" to fire Varga. 

Varga is seeking SS million in 
punitive damages and S I million 
in general damages for her 
"wrong termination and disgrace, 
humiliation and digUess caused 
by the firing," Susan Mosich, 
Varga's attorney, said. 

Varga , 52, has been "totally 
disabled by this," Mosich said . 

Named as defendants were the 
UC Regents, Solis, Atkinson, . 
Watson, Varga's assistant Eric 
Koenig and two employees in 
Varga's department. Also named 
are a UCSD student and his 
father who wrote letters criticiz-
ing Varga. 

UCSD officials have said that 
employer-employee relations are 
private matters and have declined 
to discuss Varga's termination 
for that reason. 

The lawsuit alleges that Solis 
solicited the help of Koenig by 
promising to help get Varga's job 
once she was fired. 

It also alleges that Varga dis-
cussed with Solis in late 1984 or 
early 1985 allegations that Solis 
was "openly involved in a lesbian 
relationship with a member of 
her staff," and that Solis had 
"sexually harrassed" female stu-
dents and staff. 

Solis then, the lawsuit asserts, 
conspired to fire Varga. 

After her termination Varga 
told the Guardian i'n November 
1986 that the dismissal papers 
sent to her cited her handling of 
the Andalcio lynching case as 
"one of the major reasons" why 
she was terminated . In February 
of 1986, Varga had cleared U CS D 
student Russel Andalcio of 
charges of lynching brought 
against him by the UCSD police. 

An investigation into the ad-
ministration's handling of the 
Andalcio case by the Academic 
Senate followed . The Academic 
Senate Majority Report critic-
ized the administration's hand- ' 
ling of the case and questioned 
whether Varga's actions in the 
case could have led to her termi-
nation. 

Former UCSD student Steven 
Cooper and his father, Gary, are 
being sued by Varga for writing 
letters to Solis and Atkinson 
accusing Varga of criticizing and 
harassing Cooper and making 
an anti-Semitic remark about 
him. 

One student source said Varga 
called Cooper while he was a 
member of the Third College 
Council very early one morning, 
yelled at him and made "refer-
ence to his being Jewish." The 
student claimed that Varga then 
went to Cooper's house, pounded 
on the door and yelled at Cooper 
in front of his roommates. 

Varga and Solis were unavail-
able for comment. IQ]

Society of Anesthesiologists. 

In an effort to reduce this 
number, a recent technological 
innovation called the Lifescan

created to track the minute-to-
minute changes of an injured 
brain during general anesthesia. 
Six of these monitors have been

Incinerator permit request 
sent to S.D. City Council 
By PETER MESSROBIAN 
News Editor 

The San Diego City Planning 
Commission voted unanimously 
last Thursday to send Ogden 
Environmental Services' applica-
tion for a permit to burn toxic 
waste to the city council with a 
recommendation that it be re-
turned to the commission "for 
further consideration." 

The commission also urged 
Ogden, who is seeking the final 
permit necessary to begin burn-
ing toxic materials in its Torry 
Pines Mesa facility, to file an 
Environmental Impact Report 
(EIR) even though the company 
was not required to do so by the 
Environmental Protection Agen-
cy (EPA). According to a spo-
kesperson for the Environmen-
tal Health Coalition (EHC), 
which opposes the granting of 
the permit, this was the first time 
city officials had requested that 
Ogden file an EIR. 

The commission cited a lack 
of information about the effects 
of burning toxic waste such as 

PCB's, mercury, lead, and arsenic 
on the people that live and work 
in the area around the incinera-
tor as a reason for both of their 
recommendations, as well as lack 
of time to properly study the 
issue. 

The permit Ogden has applied 
for is called a Conditional Use 
Permit, or CU P, and would allow 
the company to "operate a re-
search, development and dem-
onstration (RD&D) facility for 
the purpose of gathering infor-
mation and demonstrating the 
capabilities of the circulating bed 
combustor (CBD) technology to 
destroy hazardous waste .. . " 

There are 21 conditions listed 
on the CUP which Ogden must 
adhere to while operating the 
incinerator, in addition to 15 
conditions imposed on the per-
mit by the State Department of 
Health Services. The Department 
of Health Services had issued a 
Mitigated Negative Declaration, 
meaning that while the DHS did 
not feel that the incinerator 
would present a threat to the 
environment, certain conditions 

(the 15 mentioned above) would 
have to be met in order to insure 
that the plant was safe. 

A vocal crowd of EHC mem-
bers and supporters attending 
the commission meeting attemp-
ted to convince the commission 
to deny the CUP to Ogden, and 
several people spoke during the 
35 minutes of testimony allowed 
to each side. While opponents 
argued against granting the 
permit on the· basis of potential 
danger to both the environment 
and the people on and around 
the site of the facility, Ogden's 
lawyer, David Mulliken, asked 
the commission to limit its focus 
to the "land use question." 

Mulliken claimed that the "size 
of GA Technologies' (on whose 
land Ogden's plant sits) property 
provides a buffer" between the 
incinerator and the surrounding 
area. He also argued that the 
[land] uses in the surrounding 
area are compatible and similar," 
citing as examples other research 
companies in the Torrey Pines 
Mesa and Sorrento valley area, 
as well as the "synergistic" rela-

Atkinson to be president 
of AAAS in February 

UCSD Chancellor Richard C. Atkin-
son has been elected president-elect of 
the American Association for the Ad-
vancement of Science (AAAS). 

Atkinson was elected in Asso-
ciation-wide ballot ing during Sep-
tember and October 1987 and the 
results were tabulated this month . His 
term of office begins Feb. 16, 1988 fol-
lowing the AAAS annual meeting in 
Boston, Feb. IS. Atkinson will serve a 
year as president-elect, a year as presi-
dent and a year as chairman of the 
board for AAAS. 

Founded in 1848, the AAAS is the 
largest scientific organization in the 
United States and represents all fields 
of science. The membership of AAAS 
currently includes some 132,000 ind i-
vid ual scientists and engineers, and 
300 affiliated scientific and engineering 
societies and academies of science. for 
a total membership of approximately 
5 million. 

The objectives of the AAAS are to 
further the work of scientists, to 
improve the effectiveness of science in 
the promotion of human welfare, and 
to heighten public awareness of the 
importance of science in .progress. 

Atkinson becomes the fourth 
member of the UCSD faculty to be 
elected AAAS president. Roger 
Revelle , one of the founder of UCSD, 
was president in 1974; William McEl-
roy, former UCSD chancellor, headed 
the organization in 1976; and E. Mar-
garet Burbridge, director of the Center 
for Astrophysics and Space Sciences 
at UCSD, was president in 1981 . 

UCSD employees receive 
community service a wards 

Two UCSD employees were recent 
recipients of the Mexican-American 
Business & Professional Association's 
community service awards at the Asso-
ciation'S first Community Service Re-

cognition Awards ceremony. 
Faustina Solis, UCS D assistant 

chancellor and provost , received a 
community service award for her 
efforts on behalf of the Hispanic 
community in the field of education. 
Solis was named provost of Third Col-
lege at UCSD in 1982 and oversees the 
educational programs of approxi-
mately 3,000 students enrolled in that 
college. Third College is dedicated to 
the establishment of a multiracial. 
multicultural campus community. 

In 1984 Solis was appointed to the 
additional position of assistant chancel-
lor, with particular concern for affir-
mative action matters on the UCSD 
campus. Prior to her appointment as 
provost, Solis served as an associate 
professor in the Department of Com-
munity and Family Medicine at the 
UCS D School of Medicine and as a 
member of the Third College faculty 
where she taught in the college's urban 
and rural studie program. She joined 
the UCSD faculty in 1971. 

Delia Talmantez, a sistant director 
for staff affirmative action and conflict 
of interest at UCSD, also received an 
award by the association for her work 
in social services on behalf of the His-
panic community. Talamantez serves 
on the Citizens' Advi ory Board on 
Police/ Community Relations, the 
Hispanic Advisory Committee to 
Supervisor usan Golding and the 
City of San Diego - Mayor' His-
panic Advisory Committee, to name a 
few. 

In her po ition as as iSlant director. 
Talamantez develop, coordi nates and 
implements policies and programs that 
impact campus in the areas of staff 
affirmative action and contlict of 
interest. 

In bestowing the awards, Gil Con-
treras, president of the Mexican-
American Business & Professional 
Assocation said. "We felt it was time 
to publicly recognize these distin-
guished women, who has accomp-
lished a great deal for our community, 
for their efforts on our behalf." 

Catholic scholar delivers 
Burke lecture in PH 108 

Raymond E. Brown, called Time 
magazine "probably the premier Cath-
olic scripture scholar in the United 
States," will deliver a free public lec-
ture at UCSD on Monday, Nov. 23, at 
8:00 pm in Room 108, Peterson Hall . 

Brown's topic will be "The Star, The 
Magi, and the Wicked Herod: Mat-
thew's Gospel Story of Jesus' Birth ." 
His talk is part of the Eugene M. 
Burke Lectureship at UCSD. 

Scholars have long debated the inter-
pretations of these accounts in the Gos-
pels of Matthew and Luke, and ques-
tioned their absence in Mark and 
John. 

Brown will address these issues in 
his lecture and present an interpreta-
tion which deals with what Matthew's 
gospel meant to his divided commun-
ity of Jew and gentiles, and with what 
this gospel can mean to people of all 
faiths today. 

Since 1971 , Brown has been the 
Auburn distinguished professor of bib-
lical studies at the Union Theological 
Seminary in New York. 

During his distinguished career, he 
has been granted 15 honorary doctoral 
degrees and is the author of some 20 
books on the Bible. He has won seven 
book awards. 

In 1972, after consultation with the 
National Conference of Catholic Bish-
ops, Pope Paul VI appointed him as 
the only American on the Roman 
Pontifical Bible Commission, a post 
he held for six years. 

The Burke lectures focus on the 
functions and responsibilities of reli-
gion in society and its role in shaping 
moral and socia l values. 

The lectureship is endowed in honor 
of Eugene M . Burke , a Catholic priest 
of the Paulist order who was closely 
associated with UCSD until his death 
in 1984. Burke was a distinguished 
teacher, theologian, scholar, church 
historian and ecumenist.

UCSD Interfraternity 
council elects new officers 

The Interfraternity Council, which 
is the governing body of all recognized 
Cratemities on campus, elected officers 
last week. The council members are 
Dave Fish, president; Greg Stadler, 
vice-president; Matt Rochios, sports 
chairman; Gary Tegan, Greekweek 
chairman; Curtis Bowden, editor; and 
Thomas Rhee, director of public re-
lations. These officers will fulfill their 
respective positions starting next quar-
ter for a year term. 

Fish is enthusiastic about his elec-
tion and looks forward to the chal-
lenge. He said, "My main goal is to see 
the IFC fraternities get the respect and 
the recognition they respectfully 
deserve. " 

Reflecting on the qualifications of 
the candidates Dave McAllister, the 
current IFC V.P., stated, "This year's 
elections were extremely competitive." 

K.evin Simon, the current IFC presi-
dent , is proud of what IFC has accom-
plished and expects the same from the 
new officers. Under Simon's admini-
stration, I FC establised a judicial 
board, rewrote the constitution, and 
established a criterion for new frater-
nities seeking entrance to IFC.

Diane Takvorian, executive di-

claiming there might be "signifi-
cant environmental and public 
effects" from the operation of 
the incinertor, and she described 
the plant not as a test facility, as 
Ogden says it is , but "a small

Other EHC members, as well 
as members of the public with 
similar opinions, asked why 
Ogden was not willing to file an 
EIR if it was sure that their 
plant's emissions would not harm 
the environment, claimed that

UCSD is building an infor-
mation pavillion on Gilman 
Drive and La Jolla Village 
Drive which will be both a 
gateway to mark the entrance 
to campus and an information 
center to guide visitors to the 
university. 

The pavillion will be a land-
mark to welcome newcomers to 
the University of California, 
San Diego. The official title of 
this project is "Campus En-
trance Improvements and In-
formation Pavillion." 

The Campus Planning Com-
mission has decided to build an 
entrance pavillion with a drive-
up window, manned by repre-
sentatives from the Public 
Information Office, that can 
give specific information on 
campus activites. For example, 
La Jollans who have tickets for 
a show at Mandevi lle Center 
will be directed where to park 
and how to find the audito-
rium. The commission hopes it 
will also be a good first impres-
sion of UCSD. 

The project was initiated by 
the Campus Planning Office 
which approved the funding for 
the project. University officials 
feel the pavillion is an answer to 
the problem of no official en-
trance way to the campus. New-
comers had no way to find out 
where to go and how to get 
there. The proposed solution 
was a full experience pavillion 
with a drive-up window that 
could give information and 
directions to all visitors. 

The building of the pavillion 
has been assigned to the Facil-
ities, Design, and Construction 
Department. Approval of the 

design is the responsibility of 
Bob lohnson, the project en-
gineer. In an interview, lohn-
son said, "The project stems 
from concern for the commun-
ity and visitors. It is designed 
for their convenience." 

A model of the proposed 
pavillion is in a display case in 
the Facilities, Design, and Con-
struction office. Currently, the 
engineers are waiting for ap-
proval of the design by legal 
counselors, and project appro-
val is expected. In December, 
the construction contract for 
the project will be put up for 
bid . 

After a construction firm has 
been chosen, the Facilities, De-
sign, and Construction Depart-
ment will administer the con-
struction of the pavillion. 
Walter Brown is the construc-
tion manager for the university , 
and will oversee the actual con-
struction of the project. Ac-
cording to Brown, some lands-
caping, grading, and roadwork 
has been finished under a sep-
arate construction contract. 

The construction of the en-
trance pavillion will begin next 
year, and the pavillion should 
be completed by April 
1988. ~ 

The San Diego City council 
will discuss the CUP application 
in its December I meeting, where 
it will have three options: approve 
the permit , deny the permit, or 
send the permit back to the Plan-
ning Commission for further con-
sideration. Because of a court 
order, neither the city council 
nor the commission has the op-
tion of conti nuing, or setting the 
permit aside until a later date so 
that more information may be 
gathered and analyzed by mem-
bers of either body. [ill 

The) triangular pavillion will 
be built on the existing pull-off 
on Gilman Drive, near La 10lla 
Village Drive. There will be 
four tlags lined up outside the 
building: the U.S. flag , the 
California state flag, the Uni-
versity of California tlag, and 
the UCSD flag . The new information pavillion will be located on Gilman Drive

T oxics: waste not, 
want not 
By MATT MAC ARTHUR 
Staff Writer 

T oda y 's ra pid I y cha nging soc iet y faces 
upheavals in many areas: politics, eco-
nomics, international relations and oth-
ers. But many of these problems will not 
even matter if a larger, and more ba ic, 
problem is not faced first - the state of 
the Earth on which we live and depend. 
This problem is being either ignored or 
ineffectually poked at, and we cannot 
afford to put off the changes that are 
surely necessa ry . 

An exam'ple of this ignorance was 
discussed a couple weeks ago in a Los 
Angeles Times Magazine article about 
offshore oil drilling. The people of Calif-
ornia have been fighting the drilling off 
of the coast, but Interior Secretary Don 
Hodel seems determined to tap the last 
major American oil resource. The issues 
discussed were noble ones: Ihe pros 
maintained that it would reduce Ameri-
ca's dependence on foreign oil. the cons 
complained for environmental and aes-
thetic reasons. 

BUI these should not be the real 
issues. Suppose we drilled the continen-
tal shelf full-speed-ahead. What then? 
Ten years later we'd run oul and be in 
the same predicament , except perhaps 

occupy the area. 
Debating these issue i useless . We 

are creating no-win situations . The Earth 
had wonderful self-sustaining energy 
and water cycles long before man 
appeared, yet we are not learning from 
them. Instead, we are depleting resour-
ces thousands of times fasler than they 
could ever be replaced, making and 
throwing away materials Ihat can never 
be broken down, and taking much more 
water than we need and contaminating 
it so no one can use it again. Such 
actions have ripple effects which will 
affect the whole Earth - whether soil, 
water, or air, if they have not already 
done so. 

When people hear about such com-
monplace issue as air pollution, acid 
rain , agricultural problems, water pol-
lution , animal extinction, oil shortages, 
and so on, these topics are often treated 
as individual problems. Actually, they 
are manifestations of much bigger and 
more fundamental problems. Viewed 
Ihis way, it is clear that oil drilling 
should be dropped as soon as possible 
and a more efficient, self-perpetuating 
lechnology should replace it ; that we 
should stop producing so much trash, 
and what we do produce should be 
biodegradable; and that we should stop 

Can UCSD, a supposedly forward thinking university, 
breed a citizen who can identify, push for and work on 
the necessary changes? 

the Middle East would have also run 
out after 10 years, and our world would 
come 10 a halt . Meanwhile , all energy 
funds have gone into oil drilling, and no 
new technology has been developed to 
replace it. 

The recent local debate concerning 
trash burning in San Diego brought up 
another issue. Since no one wanted any 
more landfill, someone developed a 
plan to burn it instead; so rather than 
waste sinking into the ground, San 
Diego can breathe it instead . 

Water has also been a concern for 
San Diego. Having a tenuous water 
supply line while the demand for water 
is rising, the best solution anyone could 
come up with was to destroy one of Ihe 
last natural river valleys in San Diego 
by filling it with water, "relocating" 
anyone or anything that happened to 

using so much water and develop tech-
nologies to recycle what we now throw 
away. 

The things that regular citizens can 
do now are severely limited . There are 
newspaper recycling bins on campus, 
there's a deposit on cans and bottles as 
an incentive to return them to be re-
cycled , we can turn off the water as we 
brush our teeth ... these things are 
good, but not good enough. Not many 
of us have control over how much water 
is used when we flush our toilets. Not 
many of us seriously consider any other 
method to get downtown other than to 
hop in the car. Our world makes it 
extremely difficult to be responsive to 
conservation issues. 

It is the truth that a capitalist society 
such as the United States is based on the 
will not to take care of these issues by 

lfTTfRSlfTTfRSlfTTfRSlfTTfRSlfTTfRS 

itself. No factory will raise operating 
costs to improve air quality; no con-
sumer will buy something for twice as 
much money because it is biodegrada-
ble; no scientist will enter the field of 
alternative energy research that is floun-
dering. . 

Our society must make these things 
easy, even advantageous. Making an 
effective toilet that uses one quarter of 
the water it does now may be a bit chal-
lenging, but install one in every bath-
room and automatically billions of gal-
lons are saved; or make a car that is 
self-sus taining, or one that runs on 
another industry's potential waste; or 
make it easier for a commuter to travel 
by mass transportation than by car; 
even better, fix it so they can walk to 
work, eliminating the need for transpor-
tation altogether. The possibilities are 
endless. 

Herein lies the challenge: can UCSD, 
a supposedly forward-thinking unver-
sity, breed a citizen who can identify, 
push for and work on the necessary 
changes? This means more than politi-
cal parties, more than morals, more 
than aesthetics. This means our self-
respecting existence. More important, 

this means now, not one or two genera-
tions down the road. To say that our 
very survival depends on these changes 
would be exaggerating. Indeed, humans 
are very resilient creatures, but if the 
world will not be worth surviving in this 
ability will offer little recompense. 

Recently a Southern California neigh-
borhood had a raging debate amongst 
its residents, as manifested by their local 
newsletter. The subject was power leaf 
blowers . Half of the people argued that 
they were noisy and unnecessary. The 
other half argued that hosing away the 
leaves wasted water, a nd was less effec-
tive. This went on for about a year. 
Finally someone wrote in asking why 
didn't the people get up off of their "fat 
middle-class butts" with a broom and 
sweep up the leaves, thus getting some 
exercise with no more casualty than a 
few lost broom straws. 

We must use more brooms if we want 
our modern society to continue. This 
entails major changes in our day-to-day 
routine. The techn ology we develop 
must work with nature - not in opposi-
tion to it. Are we brave enough, smart 
enough to accept the challenge? [QJ

only one term. Now, you tell me,

Michael Schudson (chairman 
of UCSD communications de-

iology graduate) sound like a 
cou ple of bozos. Their study, 
"The Myth of the Great Commu-
nicator," (the Guardian. Nov. 
12; the San Diego Union , Nov. 
8) says that President Reagan 
has not been as popular as people 
think he has been. In fact, it says 
that Jimmy Carter was a more 
popular president than Reagan . 

Schudson and King, if you are 
reading this, I have some rather 
pedestrian observations to make. 

We have popularity polls in 
this country that have much more 
extensive participation than any-
thing Gallup has ever done. They 
are called elections. (Can you say

Hubert S. Higgins 

Contaminating San 
Diego's reputation 
Editor: 

Of greal concern lately has 

been the building of a toxic waste 
plant very close to this campus, 
to say nothing of metropolitan 
San Diego, by the Ogden Envir-
onmental Corporation. How-
ever, of greater concern is the 
fact that all of the government-
prescribed environmental impact 
reports have not been duly pro-
cessed, and that the plant is due 
to begin operating very soon. 

Realizing, of course, the great 
economic boon which this plant 
would be to the community, pro-
viding jobs and income and les-
sening the load on exisiting land-

fills, we must also keep in mind 
that the San Diego area is the 
eighth-largest in the nation. 

We have experienced very few 
of the traditional city problems 
of very large cities, such as Hous-
ton and Brooklyn, both of which 
have held the number-cight slot 
in size in the past 20 years. 
Among these problems is air pol-
lution. Building this plant would 
provide an influx of economic 
growth, but at the sacrifice of 
San Diego's excellent reputation 
if the full impact of the plant at 

its present location is not com-
pletely understood. 

There was, in recent times, 
another industrial plant very 
close to a major city which was 
not proven to be safe, and, as a 
result, thousands died and thou-
sands more will suffer for gener-
ations to come. That city's name 
is Bhopal. While I am not imply-
ing that the coming toxic waste 
plant could cause damage on the 
same level as the Union Carbide 
disaster in Bhopal, I am saying 
that we should more closely 

Monday. November 23. 198; 5 

OPINIONS 
evaluate the situation before 
placing such a proven contribu-
tor to air pollution so close to a 
major city. 

Doing less would be sheerfolly 
and would ultimately cause all 
parties involved to suffer, includ-
ing the developers . Nobody wants 
to live in a city with filthy air, 
and nobody should. Until the 
environmental impact reports are 
evaluated, the toxic waste plant 
should not go into operation, 
and then only if the reports prove 
favorable.

Should P.E. classes be offered for credit or non-credit? 

"Credit! Because they·rejun. 
They make people like school 
bet/er, and because we need to 
do whatever we can do to 
impro\'c athletics at this 
school . .. 

"Well I don't think they 
should be offered for credit 
because most people are taking 
the classes for fun anyway, and 
they don't apply towards your 
major. So there's no reason to 
have the units. " 

"Credit! In some cases peo-
ple need afew units to graduate 
and those P. E. classes could 
make or break it!" 

"I think they should be 
offeredfor credit because there s 
interest in those sort of classes. 
There's an incentive needed to 
get people to learn tennis or 
jazz dance, or other sports . .. 

.. Well. I think they should be, 
because the coaches work hard 
with the students, and students 
are putting some effort into i/. 
It's an incentive to keep mind 
and body in shape.

Academic senate approves 
Fifth College curriculum 
By JAMES GILMORE 
St4IJ WTittr 

The UCSD Academic Senate 
met last Tuesday to consider a 
number of issues , including the 
academic plan for Fifth College, 
which was approved by a large 
majority of the Senate. 

From its inception , Fifth Col-
lege was intended to educate its 
students in both Western and 
non-Western cultures. This in-
ternational focus is reflected in 
the curriculum's centerpiece, a 
six-course interdisciplinary se-
quence , The Makingofthe Mod-
ern World , which surveys the 
course of human development 
from the Stone Age to the pre-
sent. All Fifth College students 
will be have to complete a min-
imum of 18 or 19 units of general 
education requirements in fine 
arts , mathematics or computer 
science, the natural sciences, and 
composition, and they will also 
have to choose a regional sp-
ecialization and achieve pro-
ficiency in a foreign language. 

Dr. Robert Swanson, physics. 
professor and chair of the Com-
mittee on Educational Policy, 
praised the program and its 
breadth, adding that although 
the faculty may be thin in certain 
areas , the curriculm will stimu-
late departmental growth to 
handle the demand. 

Although the curricuJm re-

quirements are not as extensive 
as Revelle's , engineering Pro-
fessor Dave Miller expressed 
concern that engineering students 
would not be able to graduate in 
less than five years due to the 
demands of the general educa-
tion requirement. He complained 
that though there are many 
engineering courses of equival-
ent educational worth, none are 
recognized to satisfy any of the 
general education requirements . 

Other Senate members voiced 
similar concerns and Dr. Swan-
son assured them that the issue 
has already been recognized and 
remedies are currently being 
sought in committee. 

The faculty also spent nearly 
an hour discussing the pros and 
cons of UCSD's college system 
and its effects on the students. 
The system was generally ac-
claimed because of the diversity 
in undergraduate general edu-
cation requirements, which at-
tracts a great deal of students . 

Dr. David Wong, Warren Col-
lege provost and chair of the 
Council of Provosts, noted that 
among all public universities, 
UCSD has been rated the top 
producer of college graduates 
who go on to receive Ph.D's, the 
top producer of medical school 
matriculants, and one of the best 
undergraduate institutions in the 
nation. This year UCSD had 
21,000 applicants for 3,400 plac-

es, one of the highest ratios in the 
UC system. 

Wong said the Council of Pro-
vosts agreed that the current 
enrollment per college of about 
3,300 was acceptable and com-
mented that in 10 years the uni-
versity will need a sixth college 
to accomodate the projected 
20,000 students. 

In order to introduce students 
to distinguished faculty and their 
work , Wong said the provosts 
are pushing for a one-unit under-
graduate seminar program which 
will hopefully begin in spring 
quarter. 

Regarding the concern over 
the workload of engineering stu-
dents , Wong said that for gradu-
ates in the arts and humanities 
the average number of units 
passed is 194,14 more than the 
minimum requirement for a 
Bachelor of Arts degree and two 
more than the minimum re-
quirement for a Bachelor of 
Science degree. Arts and human-
ities students grad uate in an 
average of 4.77 years while engi-
neering students take slightly 
longer, graduating in an avera~ 
of 5.1 years . l!U

Ramirez connects with Third 
By LINDA J . GLA VE 
Staff Writer 

After the mounting tension 
and controversy rhat surrounded 
Beverly Vargas as Third College's 
dean of student affairs was re-
solved in her firing, the question 
of who would fill the vacant 
position was one of the most 
debated topics on campus. While 
many of the newly vacated ad-
ministrative positions werefilled 
br individuals who have been 
UCSD faculty members for a 
number of years, Third College's 
neH dean, Luis Ramirez, is a 
newcomer to UCSD from West-
ern Washington Universitr 
(WWU)in Bellingham, Washing-
ton. At WWU, Ramirez was the 
director of Support Programs, 
Services and Minority Affairs in 
the Student Life Office for five 
years be/ore his appointment to 
director of the Student Assist-
ance Center at the same univer-
sity. He also served as director of 
Chicano Support Services, Stu-
dent Affairs Division, at Loyola 
Marymount University in Los 
A ngeles for four years. 

Ramirez received a bachelor's 
degree in Chicano studies and 
anthropology from Cal Srare 
Northridge in 1971, and a mas-
ter's degree in history from Loy-
ola Marymount in 1978. Pleased 
10 be back in Southern Califor-
nia, he's resumed his hobbies of 

''cycling around Mission Bay and 
jogging. He is married and has 
two daughters, ages 15 and 11, 
who, he says laughingly, keep 
him current with tudents, espe-
cially their music. 
Guardian: What made you come 
to UC D? 
Ramirez: First of all. Third Col-
lege offered a similar background 
to my educational experience; 
the multi-cuhural aspect, the 
focus on understanding Third 
World i sues, pOlit ical and social 
awareness and development, the 
outstanding reputation of 
UCSD. the undergraduate focus 
all drew me here . Even though 
there is a focus on the graduate 
and re earch fields, we put an 
empha i on the undergraduate 
experience. And the fact that we 
are organizing a cluster college 
system so that we can try to pro-
vide personal attention to the 
immediate needs 0 the students 
attracts me . 
Guardian: You eem to have had 
a very successful career at West-
ern Washington University. Why 
~id you leave? 
Ramirez: I spent eight years at 
Western Washington Univer ity 
and it was an outstanding expe-
rience. I enjoyed my relationship 
with the students over the eight 
years , and interacting with the 
student affairs profe sionals. It 
was time for me to try a different 
experience.

Ramirez: Both UCSDand WWU 
pay strong attention to the under-

profile is similar in that each has 
a great number of students that 
matriculate directly out of high 
school, and both institutions have 
a broad li beral arts education 
program. The obvious difference 
i that UCS D ha major research 
programs, which includ e engi-

Luis Ramirez speaks of his goals for Third College - one of which 
is to make the La Casa complex a place used by both commuter 
and resident students. 
Ramirez: I think that the fact 
that there are mainly Hispanic 
people in the administration' 
should not be seen as deliberate 
or that we are only going to be 
responsible for, or focus our 
attention on, the Hispanic expe-
rience. I certainly feel that my 
background , and those of my 
colleagues, demonstrate that we 
have a multi-cultural experience. 
Anyone spending 10 or 15 years 
in higher education will obviously 
know that not all st udents are 
Hispanics, so you ha ve to pick 
up something over those years in 

working with other students. I 
think every university and col-
lege should meet their goals, and 
that is to provide educational 
opportunities to all its citizen , 
especially those that have been 
underrepresented in the past. 
Guardian: Do you think Third 
College is meeting its goals? 
Ramirez: We still haven't reached 
as many minority students [to 
get them] to complete their edu-
cation. The goals that were iden-
tified back in the 1970s haven't 
diminished though .

The Twinkie defense 

Saltman makes nutrition easy to digest 
By LISA QUINTANA 
Staff Writer 

A s the holidays approach with their rituals of lavish eating, it might be a good 
idea to keep Paul Saltman's "The 
California Nutrition Book" on 
hand . It may be the perfect gift 
idea for that 'junk foodjunkie'in 
your life. This latest work by Dr. 
Saltman, a professor of Biology 
at UCSD, has, however, been 
the center of controversy since 
its release. Sa lt man has repeated-
ly come under fire from other 
' nutritional experts'for what they 
believe are radical view. 

Although his greatest critics 
make it seem like Saltman has no 
credentials to back-up his beliefs, 
he has been involved in nutrition 
for well over 20 years. In the 
1950s, while he was an assistant 
professor at the Univer ity of 
Southern California (USC), Salt-
man became concerned with the 
problems of iron overload suf-
fered by alcoholics. From there 
his interest moved on to studying 
iron metabolism , the physiology 
of iron, and eventually to exercise 
and nutrition. 

While he was at USC, Saltman 
was already stirring things up. 
During a discussion about the 
merits of white bread versus those 
of wheat bread a wager was 

made, and Saltman's opponents 
purchased whole wheat grains 
with which they proceeded to 
bake bread . Saltman went out to 
the supermarket and bought 
white bread . Both breads were 
fed to separate groups of lab rats 
for a period of time and , time 
and time again, the rats fed white 
bread proved to grow more and 
for a more sustained length of 
time. 

Saltman said, "It was enriched 
white bread . All of the things 
necessary for the rat's growth 
had been added," and just be-
cause they were added does not 
mean they are any less effective 
than that which nature has al-
ready provided . In addition, Salt-
man said, "It's alljust a matter of 
aesthetics. I personally would 
never touch white bread ." 

SaItman has two other books 
to his credit: "The Biochemistry 
and Physiology of Iron ," and a 
'hardcore' science book , "The 
New Nutrition Study Guide and 
R eader," (co-written with 
Yvonne Baskin), a compilation 
of essays and articles in book 
form, meant for those who know 
nothing about science. 

It was not SaItman's idea ori-
ginally to begin a third work . 
Mary Walshok, dean of UCSD 
extension, approached him about

three years ago with the idea, 
and Saltman agreed to do it 
under the cond ition that another 
science writer would be assisting. 
As it turned out, there were two 
writers assisting: Ira Mothner 
and Joel Gurin, who wrote the 
first and second drafts of the 
book using Saltman's outline. 

Additionally, Salt man called 
upon professors and physicians 
from within the UC system, in-
cluding Berkeley and UCLA, 
with the majority of UC cam-
puses having a representati ve 
who assisted in creating the book. 
"California Nutrition," Saltman 
emphasized, "repre ents the be t 
knowledge in the UC system ." 

"California Nutrition" was 
written for the benefit of those 
who have no science background. 
It explains exactly what a calorie 
is and what a protein is. In the 
simplest of terms it affords a 
basic understanding of the nutri-
tion of food , how the body as-
similates what it receives and 
what the body needs in various 
stages of development. SaItman 
adopted this approach " because 
each person has to learn to live 
within their own context of age, 
diet and d isease, etc ... " 

This work also explains the 
need for exercise and weight con-

Saltman 
Continued from pale 9 
trol. It advocates exercise of all 
types. Saltman himself, nearing 
60, is an avid surfer, but said: "I 
don't go out in rough water; I 
don't go out in the cold. I no 
longer need to be miserable." 
Toxic pleasures are also men-
tioned. Alcohol is depicted as 
having a place within a healthy 
lifestyle. 

Saltman believes that "the 
most serious eating problem 
today is obesity .... We have so 
many cheap foods now in the 
supermarket that we tend to over-
do it , and we become obese." 

"There is no magic diet. There 
is no anti-cancer diet , no anti-
heart disease," he said . What 
Saltman and his colleagues ad-
vocate is responsible weight man-
agement by knowing what your 
body needs when it needs it. "All 
the other diets say 'you can't eat 
this, you can't eat that.' This 
book gives the individual a ra-
tional approach to life and a way 
to enjoy food - one of the 
greatest pleasures in life." 

Saltman holds that there is an 
aesthetic and nutritional value to 
every food . To his critics, who 
sneer at his view that nutritional 
additives are okay and items 
such as a Twinkie can have nutri-
tionally redeeming value, Salt-
man responds: "There are 10,000 
times more cancer-causing ele-
ments in natural foods than in 
processed .... They're saying that 
there have been all kinds of in-

creases in all the types of cancer, 
when in reality they have either 
been maintained or decreased. 
Only the number of cases oflung 
cancer have risen ... 

Even Phil Donahue suggested 
that Saltman has vested inter-
ests . Salt man has stressed, how-
ever, that he only wants to warn 
people against those "dogmatisb 
who prefer to ignore the lessons 
of science. This is a liberation 
biology." It appears that many 
people are ready to be liberated . 
Despite its panning by the critics 
the book sold more than 30,000 
copies within the first month 
after its release. 

Professor Saltman is also Quite 
well known at UCSD. He was a 
vice chancellor for many years 
before he lost the chancellorship 
to Atkinson and decided to return 
to teaching, and, in 1984, Salt-
man received the Most Valuable 
Professor award from Muir Col-
lege. 

Six years ago, the biology de-
partment approached Saltman 
about developing a course for 
non-science major undergrad-
uates that would fulfill general 
req4irements, yet would be in-
teresting to students. Saltman 
developed Biology 19, a course 
on nutrition, and it proved to be 
a success: "The course was 
packed every quarter," Salt man 
said. 

Saltman said, "I aman intense 
and passionate person. I need to 
be exciting and stimulating in 
order to generate something." 
The tudents enrolled in Salt-
man's courses often had little or 
no background at all in either

chemistry or biology and had a 
lack of interest in the subjects, 
but "ultimately the students came 
out knowing chemistry and bio-
logy" along with "knowing the 
difference between food and 
nutrition ... 

Saltman is still very popular at 
UCSD, and his Biology 19 course 
offered during Spring Quarter is 
often very crowded. Third Col-
lege student Diana Bloom, who 
completed the course last spring, 
said, ~'He was always very con-
cerned and made himself very 
available to us ." During last 
spring, Saltman and his wife 
hosted a "fireside" at their home 
for about 30 of his students, and 
served fruit and pastries . It would 
seem that Saltman's classroom 
methods are analagous to his 
nutritional views - be respon-
sible but have fun at the same 
time. [QJ

Continued from page 8 
"reality gap ." The two sectors 
perceive the on-going events of 
the day in very different ways. 
Caddell said that the Washington 
reality was self-gratifying and 
deflected blame away from itself. 
This resulted in politicians ig-
noring the pressing issues of the 
nation . 

The reason for all of this , 
according to Caddell, is that the 
United States is a country in 
relative decline. Hestated, "What 
we have for the first time in our 
history is an elite managing 
decline rather than growth and 

success ." Thus, politicians, who 
face up to this problem of decline 
admit failure at the risk of getting 
voted out of office. 

Another serious problem that 
inhibits politicians from address-
ing national problems is the 
corrupting influence of money. 
Caddell said that congressmen 
spend all their time raising money 
and not solving the urgent issues 
of the nation . He feels that the 
underlying cause of this is the 
enormous expense required to 
conduct a campaign. Politicians 
are too busy worrying about the 
future to think about the present. 

This problem is also respon-
sible for the overrepresentation 
of interest groups that donate 
large amounts of money to cam-
paigns, thus infringing upon the 
broad interests of the average 
voter. Caddell remarked, "Poli-
tics is the only business where 
people give you money, suppo-
sedly asking for nothing in re-
turn . " 

There has been a change in the 
attitude of the American voters 
in the past 20 years with the 
emergence of a new yu ppie gene-
ration, according to Caddell. The 
problem, he added, is that the 
Washington political establish-
ment has not tuned in to this 
change. This new generation of 
voters wants new ideas and as a 
result have supported anti-estab-
lishment, outsider candidates. 

Caddell started his career at 
the age of 22. Havingjust gradu-
ated from Harvard , he was hired 
by the George McGovern cam-
paign as a pollster and was cre-

dited with helping McGovern 
win the Democratic presidential 
nomination . As Frank Mankie-
wicz, the aide who hired Caddell 
said, "He was young, he was 
cheap, we thought he was bril-
liant, and we were right ." 

Caddell won further attention 
for his instrumental role in help-
ing Jimmy Carter win the 76 
presidency and his work for 
Carter in '80. In '84, his strategy 
was crucial to Gary Hart's over-
night upswing and near upset 
over Walter Mondale for the 
Democratic presidential nomina-
tion. 

Regarding the upcoming presi-
dential election, Caddell had been 
working for congressman Joe 
Biden, but with Biden's sudden 
downfall he has found himself 
out in the cold without a candi-
date. He is also the founder of 
Cambridge Survey Research and 
is presently teaching at UC Santa 
Barbara . 

Caddell ended his lecture with 
a bit of advice for the members 
of this "country in decline." Fresh 
bold ideas, he said, are an abso-
lute necessity to solving the 
enormous problems ofthe coun-
try. He bombasted the present 
political esta blishment, calling 
its standards those of "medioc-
rity." The American people, he 
urged, need to stop being disaf-
fected and realize that they can 
change things. What is needed to 
cha nge the present political si-
tuation, according to Caddell, is 
a social movement with new 
leadership and the energy of the 
American people behind it. [Q)

residents' life program. My as-
sistant dean has just recently 
been appointed despite the fact 
that she has already been here 
for [over] three years . J am in the 
process of hiring a student activi-
ties coordinator and two as ist-
ant deans. The residents' life 
program is starting its second 
year, so in many ways we are 
forming intoa complete unit and 
I see some exciting times ahead. 

As far as immediate goals, I 
am assessing the Third College 
students, observing their ethnic 
and academic backgrounds, 
whether they are traditional or 
older returning students, whether 
they are on financial aid or not, 
whether they are living on cam-
pus or commuting - just getting 
a complete understanding of the 
Third College tudents . I would 
like to connect the students with 
the Third College community. 

I know that we have a new 
university student center open-
ing up next year that will meet 
the needs of the entire campus, 
but still I would like to find a 
place in the Third College area to 
be our own place. 

"E very university 
should provide educa-
tional opportunities to all 
its citizens." 

Guardian: What or where would 
you like that to be? 
Ramirez: Well , the obvious area 
would be the La Casa complex. 
We need to work with student 
to identify how we might use that 
particular facility for its maxi-
mum involvement with the stu-
dents' experience. 
Guardian: If you could choose 
just one thing that you would 
like to see Third College do for 
its students, what would that be? 
Ramirez: To establish a real sense 
of spirit of connect\!dness and 
community among its students. 
[For example] upper division 
students working closely with 
lower division students and help-
ing them along. Also, fully inte-
grating students into our activi-
ties and programs. And I see 
that. 
Guardian: How would you char-
acterize your leadership style? 
Ramirez: I see my role as that of 
a catalyst, to provoke and stimu-
late student interest, also to max-
imize the best from my staff for 
the student activities. I've used 
my first few months here study -
ingthe students, trying to under-
stand the interests of the staff 
and what they have to offer, and 
gelling their understandings of 
the day to day issues and con-
cerns from their perspective. 
Guardian: What is your opinion 
of the average student. .. not just 
at Third, but throughout 
UCSD'! 
Ramirez: I" think that they are 
very much determined to reach 
their academic and career goals . 
They are trying to develop their 
individual identity, learning how 
to interact with others, having 
their personal values challenged 
fo r the first time a re~ult of 
bei ng with other s tudent~ of dif-
ferent background s and differ-
ent ideas . I see them as serious,

Women's volleyball wins championship 
By JON A THAN SCHRETER 
Sports Editor 

" We et winning the natio nal 
cham pionshi p as our goal at the 
beginning of the year, and we 
pulled it out," said U C San Die-
go's women's volleyball coach 
Doug Dannevik. 

For the second consecutive 
season, the UCSD Tritons took 
the CAA Division I I I Cham-
pionship by defeating Elmhurst 
College in consecutive set , 16-
14, 16-14, 15-10, Saturday in 
Elmhurst , Illinois. 

It is the first time any Division 

I II team has won consecutive 
titles. It also marked Dannevik's 
fourth championship in seven 
yea rs . 

Senior hitter Janet Hughes led 
the Tritons (31 -4) with 15 kills 
and four block and senior Lori 
Luhnow contribu ted II kills' in 
the victory. Senior setter Carol 
Lipson finished Saturday with 
34 assists and 16 digs. 

"We went into the final four 
with a positive atti tude," said 
Dannevik. "The oth er three 
schools were just happy to have 
made it this far in the first place 
and were only hoping to play

well. We were a little more dedi-
cated and a lot more committed 
to winning. That made the dif-
ference. " 

After taking the first game, 
UCS D lost control and fell 
behind, 12-3, in the second game. 
At this point, Dannevik put 
freshman hitter Rachel Vetter 
into the game who spurred the 
Tritons to a comeback 16- 14 
win . According to Dannevi k, the 
win was the turning point for the 
Tritons. 

"We started out really nicely, 
with rhythm from the beginning," 

See V-BALL, page 13 

Seniors Janet Hughes and Carol Lipson were named first-team 
All -Americans before the semi-finals match. Hughes had 32 kills 
and Lipson had over 60 assists for the weekend. 

Basketball wins opener 
By PHIL GRUEN 
Staff Writtr 

It wasn't pretty, but after the 
UCSD men's varsity basket ball 
team settled down from their 
initial over-excitement, they 
crushed the visit ing La Verne 
Leopards in the seaso n opener at 
the Triton gym, 93-74. Accord-
i\1g to head coach Tom Mar-
shall , "It was a good team per-
formance, but we really haven't 
gotten into a rhythm yet." Judg-
ing from the first half of the 
game, there is little doubt that 
there is truth to this statement . 

For the entire first half, it 
appeared as if the only kind of 
rhythm the Tritons could get 
into was synco pated and offbeat. 
Of co urse , that says nothing of 
La Verne's disorganized, pitiful 
effort. Yet, it seemed as if the 
only way either team would score 
came as a direct result of the 
other team's mistakes . Consider, 
if you will : shots clanking off the 
backboard , shots not hitt ing 
anything at all, passing the ball 
without looking, passing the ball 
to the other team, passing the 
ball to the referee, and fighting 

within teams (these last two , not 
surprisingly, were committed by 
members of the La Verne squad). 
UCS D did not even convert a 
shot from outside the key until 
nearly nine minutes had expired 
in the first half. 

Although there are no official 
stats on it, the shooting percen-
tage from outside the key from 
both teams probably hovered 
somew here around .150 in the 
first half. " It was horrible," Mar-
shall said concerning his team's 
first half performance. "But there 
was just a lot of high excitement 
out there because each team was 
playi ng their first game . We just 
need to learn to settle down , 
relax , and ha ve fun." 

In the second half, U CS D had 
a lot of fun . Although they 
already possessed a 42-31 lead at 
the half (both teams managed to 
score this many points primarily 
on a collection of layups and 
shots from inside the key), the 
Tritons never let up for a second 
and only extended their lead for 
the majority of the final period . 
Incidentally, the Tritons moved 
out to an immediate 4-0 lead at

the beginning of the game and 
never relinquished their advan-
tage for the remainder of the 
contest. 

Led by senior team captain 
Andy Jedynak ( 15 points and 8 
rebounds), so phomore Andy 
Wagstaff ( 15 points), guard Bill 
Gerlach (who came off the bench 
and poured in a team-leading 18 
points), and junior point guard 
Rob Rittger (5 assi ts and 5 
steals), the Tritons finally put it 
together in the second half. La 
Verne also looked a great deal 
sharper in the econd period , as 
they played in a more organized 
fas hion despite only seeing their 
deficit increase. Leading the way 
for the Leopards were guards 
Maurice Gendrow and Martell 
Johnson, who scored 14 and 32 
points, respectively. 

Other than the fact that it was 
their first game playing under 
new head coach Gary Stewart, 
there were a couple of factors 
working against La Verne. First 
of all, it was Spirit Night at 
UCSD and a near capacity crowd 
of primarily intoxicated fans 
were behind the Tritons. Also, of 
the La Verne players that saw 
time during the game, their aver-
age height was approxiately 
5' 11". UCSD's average height 
was nearly 6'5". 

UCSD next plays host to the 
Triton Tip-Off Tournament , 
which begins next Friday at 6 pm 
in the Triton gymnasium . The 
other teams competing in the 
tournament include Occidental, 
Grand Canyon, and the great 
nicknamed UC Santa C ru z 
Banana Slugs. @

said Dannevik. "Elmhurst was 
expecting us to pla y at a certain 
level , a level they were sure they 
could not beat us at. We had 
them beat mentally, although 
they were probably better phy-
sically. " 

Senior setter Carol Lipson and 
Luhnow were named to the all-
tournament team because of their 
consistent play through the tour-
nament. 

The Tritons had worked thei r 
way into the final match by 
defeating nO. 4-ranked III inois-
Benedictine College (42-3) 15-

Coach Doug Dannevik 
17, 15-13,15- 11 , 15-9. 

Hughes again led the Tritons 
with 18 kills. Senior hitter Jen-
nifer Pettigrew had 16 kills and 
15 digs and Luhnow added II 

kills and 16 digs. Lipson played a 
crucial part once again , with 53 
assists and 27 digs. I BC's AIl-
American hitter Anne Wester-
camp led her team with 14 kills . 

The Tritons had served twice 
for the win in the first game but 
due to unorganized play, they 
lost both opportunities. In the 
second game, I BC jumped out to 
a 12-6 lead . "We were j ust out of 
sync," said Dannevik . But some 
good passi ng by Luhnow and , 
according to Dannevik, an "un-
toppable" Pettigrew, the Trit-

ons came back to win 15-13. 
"Jennifer was the hero in the 

game ," Said Dannevik . " We were 
plaYing poorly and searching for 
someone to take control and 
Jennifer came in and took 
charge. " 

With the match tied at one 

game apiece, game three proved 
to be a pivotal one . Tied at II - II , 
Pettigrew and Hughes combined 
with two kills apiece for a 15-11 
win . 

UCSD took a 9-1 lead in game 
four and after a number of side-
outs , it was Hughes' turn to take 
cha rge and se nd the Tritons to 
the finals, 15-9. 

"The victory was a total team 
effort ," said Dannevik. "Janet 
and Carol will get most of the 
recognition because of their per-
formances in the past , but there 
were a lot of unsung heroes as 
welL" 

For one, Dee Dee Bigelow 
came off the bench Saturday to 
serve game point in the first 
game and put down a kill on the 
back line to win the seco nd game.

Palmer, who " played like a 
freshman" on Friday, according 
to Dannevik, started on Satur-
day and produced eight key 
blocks, the majority coming 
against Elmhurst's All-American 
hitter Therese Dorrigan. Ellen 
Chi and Vetter played key roles 
as substitutes in the second game, 
playing undaunted volleyball. 
"The other teams had a starting 
six and that was it," said Dan-
nevik . But we had twelve players 
who could go in and contribute 
without decreasing the level of 
play. That was another key 
advantage. " 

Before the semi-final game, 
Hughes and Lipson were named 
to the All-American first team, 
Division III. Lipson was nomi-
nated to the first team last year 
as well . Hughes was on the second 
team All-American in 1986. 

Hughes also earned Division 
III Reebok National Player of 
the Year honors and will be 
flown to Indiana to the Ameri-
can Volleyball Coach's Associa-
tion annual banquet to receive 
the award along with winners 
from Division I, II , NAIA and 
junior college schools. 

The most noticeable difference 
at the beginning of the 1988 sea-
son will be the loss of four seniors, 
including two All-Americans. 
However, Dannevik is not fret-
ting. " It will definitely be a tran-
sitio n year. However, the only 
position we will need to fill in the 
off-season is a you ng setter to 
back up Laurie Bertanyi . We 
won't be as consistent as we were 
this year, but we will still be fun 
to watch," said Dannevik. @]

runners from 14 women's teams, 
with times in the 19:20's. 

we will try to prepare for that 
next year," said Stanforth. 

On Saturday, UC San Diego 
sent its top runners to the Na-
tional meet in Holland , Michi-
gan . However, due to the differ-
ent conditions the Tritons found 
running a little more difficult . 

" When it's twenty degrees out-
side, with four to six inches of 
snow and a deep grass course, as 
a west coast team, it's difficult to 
get prepared ," aid Triton coach 
Mark Stanforth. However, it is 
not impossible. Claremont Col-
lege's women took fifth and 
twenty-first places and finished 
tenth as a team. 

With the season now over, 
most of the runners will be turn-
ing to the long distance events on 
the track and field team. But 
come summertime, the team will 
be getting back to basics - minus 
a few runners . 

Facing runners from 21 teams, 
Tom Zois finished 128th in the 
men 's division with an unofficial 
time of26: 16. Denise McFayden 
and Sabrina Jensen, the top two 
women runners for UCSD fin -
ished in the mid 80's to 90's amid 

This was Stanforth's first taste 
of Division II I national competi-
tion. "I now realize that the level 
of competition is pretty high, so 

Tim Vallez and Chris McNatt, 
two of the men 's top five runners 
will be graduating in spring. The 
women will lose Andrea Veach 
and possibly Chris Neal, two of 
the top five women's run -
ners. @]
