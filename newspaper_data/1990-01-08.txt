Ex -Press Secretaries 
Discuss Truth And 
The u.S. Presidency 
Secretaries From Kennedy Through Reagan 
Discuss Their Roles During UCSD Symposium 

By CATHERINE DILLE 
News Editor 

Candid as well as frank in their 
portrayals of White House press 
relations, the ten former presiden-
tial press secretaries who met in an 
unprecedented symposi um at 
UCSD on Friday gave America a 
glimpse of the White House on the 
other side of the television camera. 

Chancellor received a blunt 
answer from former Carter press 
secretary Jody Powell. " I lied,' 
Powell said. 

Powell explained that in re-
sponse to a reporter's question as 
to whether the president was plan-
ning a mission to rescue the Ira-
nian hostages, he replied with a 
"No" and proceeded to feed him a 
pre-fabricated response.

VOLUME 69, #2 MONDAY, JANUARY 8, 1990 

Former presidential press secretaries (I-r) Jerald terHorst, Jody Powell, and Larry Speakes 
joined seven other former secretaries in a symposium held Friday at UCSD. The symposium, titled "The 

Presidency, The Press and The 
People," brought together ten presi-
dential press secretaries serving 
seven presidents and spanning over 
30 years of White House politics. 
The event was taped for public 
television and shown Friday eve-
ning in San Diego on KPBS. 

Students Show Support For Schoenberg 
As Price Ce ter Protester's Trial Nears 

One recurring theme during the 
two-and-one-half-hour taping was 
the importance of whether or not to 
tell the truth when dealing with the 
press and the public. 

After describing a press 
secretary's job as "accentuating the 
positive and minimizing the nega-
tive" in often-delicate situations, 
NBC correspondent and modera-
tor for the event John Chancellor 
asked the former secretaries what 
they did when circumstances dur-
ing their terms in office made it 
necessary to "shade the truth."

Contributing Writer 

Students gathered Friday on the 
gym steps for a pre-trial rally to 
support UCSD dissident Arnie 
Schoenberg. 

Schoenberg is facing two mis-
demeanor charges for his actions 
while protesting during the open-
ing of the Price Center on April 21. 
Although four out of approximately 
30 demonstrating students were 
arrested at the protest, only Sch-
oenberg was formally charged. 

Communication Department 

Lecturer DeeDee Halleck ad-
dressed the group on the Hump. " I 
think th" vicious persecution of 
the students who tried to inject a 
little humanity into the opening of 
the Price Center is unbelievable. I 
applaud the students who protested 
with a great deal of imagination 
and energy against [the Price 
Center]," she said. 

According to police reports, 
Schoenberg is charged with mali-
cious mischief for allegedly pop-
ping balloons and resisting, ob-
structing, and delaying an officer 
in the line of duty. 

Suite Door Policy Decision Reached 
By SETH SLATER 
Editor In Chief 

In response to last quarter's 
student outcry against paternal-
ism, the Muir College resident 
dean staff has announced a new 
suite door policy which will al-
low freer access to student living 
quarters in residence halls 

The new policy, announced 
last week, modifies a plan 
adopted in November to comply 
with state fire codes. The policy 
calls for the outfitting of suite 
doors, which currently lock auto-
matically upon closing, with new 
locking mechanisms that will 
allow residents to manuany un-
lock the doors from the in ide. 
The doors , under Title 19 of the 
California Code of Fire Regula-
tion , are required to be shut 
around the clock. The November 
policy met with critici ms that 

pennanently-Iockedsuitedoorsare 
both bothersome and unnecessary. 

A Muir College flyer an-
nounced last week that residence 
hall bathrooms, will be fitted with 
doorstoops and automatically lock-
ing doors. 

T he changes were "imple-
mented as an attempt to provide 
good and realistic security forresi-
dents, while also allow ing for social 
interaction," according to the flyer. 

Not all Muirresidents are happy 
about the prospect oflocking bath-
rooms, and feel this aspect of the 
policy will be unnecessarily in-
convenient. Many, however, are 
pleased with the new policy. or at 
least find it tolerable. 

"There ha to be some compro-
mise," said Muir re ident Ned 
Williamson, a ophomore. "And I 
think that's probably as good a 
it ' going to get. I think, probably, 
people won't fight it." 

Women living on the first 
floor of Tenaya Hall are particu-
larly supportive of the policy 
changes. 

"{ don't like showering in 
front of an audience," first-year 
student Susan Leven tein said, 
explaining that residents of suites 
on the lower floors are particu-
larly suceptable to uninvited 
strangers. 

Muir Residential Life staffer 
Andrea Finerty i pleased that 
the deans were responsive to stu-
dent input in revising their No-
vember policy. 

"I think that that's why the 
change ha come about," Finerty 
said. "{ think, if that town meet-
ing [last quarter] hadn't happened 
and if house advi ors hadn ' t 
houted at every meeting, it 

wouldn't have happened .... I 
wasn't sure they were hearing 
u .'" 

Graduate student Sue VanHat-
tum spoke in Schoenberg 's de-
fense. "Did he damage anybody? 
Anything but balloons? I don't 
think so. If Arnie i the only one 
speaking up, they are going to in-
timidate him. I think we all need to 
speak up." 

Others at the rally spoke out 
against the University's construc-
tion of the Price Center without 
what they felt was adequate stu-
dent approval or input. 

"We 're here to protest the 
University's high Price Center," 
proclaimed Peter Bogdanovich. 

"We' re saying we are not being 
very well represented. Students 
have little ay in how thecampu is 
being developed," Bogdanovich 
continued. 

Bogdanovich aid of the Price 
Center prote t, "We picked up our 
instrument and marched down to 
put some reality in their celebra-
tion." 

According to him, the police 
intervened in the demon tration 
because the Price Center had been 
designated a a non-free peech 
area. 

"What the Univer ity want to 
do is keep things quiet, and what 
we want to do i inform people," 
aid Narciso Arguelle , who di -

tributed tlyer to the crowd. The 
flyers called for making the Price 
Center a free peech area. and 
dropping the charge again t ch-
o nberg. 

AccorJing to Price Center offi-
cial . the enter i a ··programming 
area." Thi mean that a per on or 
group may talk at any time, unle 
omeon el e ha a re ervation for 

an event at the same time. A reser-
vation must be made with the Price 
Center Reservations Office for 
amplification to be u ed. 

When asked last May why 
Schoenberg 's charges were proc-
essed through the San Diego City 
Attorney 's Office rather than 
through the UCSD College Judi-
cial Board ystem, UCSD Police 
Lt. J. Dyer aid that "in 
Schoenberg ' case, he has been 
involved in a number of incidents, 
and he just doesn ' t eem to get the 

Arnie Shoenberg 
mes age. He wa re ponsible for 
the Price Center fiasco." 

Schoenberg remained eated 
during the rally. a other howed 
their upport for him. "They are 
two dumb, tupid mi demeanor. 
Technically. I could face a year 
and a half in jail. I take it eriou Iy 
that I could be convicted r.nd have 
a record," choenberg aid. 

Trial proceeding for The 
People I'S. Arnie Schoenberg are 

heduled to begin today. 



UCNEWs JI Superconductivity Researcher Appointed To Physics Chair 
Physics Professor M. Brian Maple, a leading author-

ity in experimental re ' earch on superconductivity and 
magnetism. has been appointed the first holder of the 
Bernd T. Matthias Chair in Phy ics at UCSD. 

UCB CO-OpS Could Approve 
Housing Unmarried Couples 

Student cooperativ houses in Berkeley are on the 
brink of allowing homosexual partners to rent rooms. 

An uncontested propo al asking that 10 percent of 
room~ in the 18 hou es of the Uni er ity Students' 
Cooperative Association ( CSA) be reserved for un-
married couples ~ ill reach the group's board this week. 

"I t [would 1 create a nice living atmo phere." said Seth 
Fo ter. hou e manager at the Cloyne Court cooperative. 
"It might be a situat ion 1'd be interested in living in." 

The USCA' plan to accommodate homo exual 
couples beginmng in the fall of 1990 follows UCB 
Chancellor I. Michael Heyman 's decision last year not to 
allow unmarried couples to reside in married student 
housing. 

Sub equent to the chancellor's decision to permit 
only legally married couple in married tudent housing 
unit , members of the co-op system have pushed for 
housing for partners who they say are effectively mar-
ried. 

"The whole reason the proposal was brought up is 
because of Chancellor Heyman," aid USCA spoke man 
Derek Gla ,noting, nonetheless, that providing room 
for the University's homo exual couple. "is something 
people have been dOing for years, really."

Establishment of the endowed chair was approved in 
July by the Board of Regents to honor the late UCSD 
professor Bernd T. Matthias, a pioneer in the field of 
uperconductivity. 

"Brian Maple i an ideal choice as the first appoint-
mentto the Matthias Chair," said Harold Ticho, UCSD's 
vice chancellor for academic affairs. "Maple's work 
exemplifies the high standard of research quality set by 
the late Professor Matthias." 

One avenue of Maple's research involves creating 
new superconducting materials. Superconducting mate-
rials, unlike ordinary electrical conductors, can carry 
electrical current without energy loss. Envisioned appli-
cations for these matenals range from superfast comput-
ers to high-speed trains that float along on magnetic 
fields. 

'"This appointment means a great deal to me because 
Bernd Matthias was my teacher and mentor as well as a 
friend and colleague for many years," Maple said. "I 
accept the chair with a certain feeling of sadnes, ince 
Bernd is no longer here to share in the excitement that 
currently exists in the field of high temperaturesupercon-
ducting materials which he pioneered."

PRESS: 10 Former Presidential Secretaries Discuss Their Experiences 
Continued from page 1 

Powell said he learned as much 
as possible about the rescue mis-
sion in advance, "not so that I could 
tell the truth, but so that I could tell 
the most convincing lie," Powell 
said. 

"I didn't feel I had the right, in 
a moral sense, to play with the 
lives of the people on the opera-
tion," he said. 

Ron Nessen. press secretary for 
President Ford, said healso witheld 
the truth, but for "silly reasons." 

Nessen said that one such inci-
dent occurred when Ford went to 
play golf in Florida, and "we 
dreamed up some community 
meeting for him to be attending." 

"I simply couldn't bring myself 
to look the press corps in the eye 
and say, ' He wants to play golf, 
he's going to Florida to play golf, .. ' 
he said. 

Larry Speakes, who served as 
spokesman for President Reagan, 
recalled a situation when he unwit-
tingly passed along erroneous in-
formation to the press. 

Speakes said that when a re-
porter asked him if the United 
States was going to invade Gre-
nada, he said "preposterous," be-
cause that is what Admiral Poin-
dexter had told him. 

"However, that next morning 
we invaded Grenada," he said. 

"I learned my lesson; if you ask 
are we going to invade Grenada 
today, remember to ask, ' What 
about tomorrow? '" Speakes 

mused. 
Speakes' lack of foreknowl-

edge regarding the Grenada inva-
sion caused Chancellor to ask how 
much a presidential press secre-
tary should know and how soon he 
should know it. Several of the for-
mer secretaries related incidents 
when they were put in the ticklish 
position of defending their Presi-
dents ' decisions to the press and 
public when they themselves had 
only just been apprised of the situ-
ation. 

"I almo t resigned afterthe Bay 
of Pigs, for a very important rea-
son: I was given no access to the 
fact that the Bay of Pigs was com-
ing up. I only learned of the Bay of 
Pigs only three hours before it 
happened," said Pierre Salinger, 
Kennedy 's press secretary. 

After that, "I went to Kennedy 
and said, ' I 've got to know every-
thing that is going on in the White 
House, '" he recalled. 

Salinger said the lines of com-
munication between his office and 
the president's that opened up af-
ter that incident facilitated the 
successful handling of the Cuban 
Missile Crisis. 

"How little things change in 20 
years," Speakes reflected. "Just as 
Salinger didn't know about the 
Cuban Missile Crisis, I didn ' t know 
about the Grenada invasion until 
the morning of the event. 

"I think that presidents need to 
learn that press secretaries should 
be involved in all policy when it is 

conceived. They should be seated 
around the table when the policy is 
developed," Speakes said. 

He suggested that "if] had been 
sitting at the table whenacoupleof 
guys said, 'Hey, why don't we 
give that money we're getting from 
the Ayotollah for those arms and 
give it to the Contras,' and I had 
sa id, 'That won't look too good on 
the front page of the Washington 
Post,' we might have saved our-
selves a lot of trouble," Speakes 
said, referring to the Iran-Contra 
Scandal that plagued the Reagan 
Administration. 

Former Press Secretary James 
Brady. who was critically wounded 
in the 1981 attempt on Reagan's 
Ii fe, agreed that the press secretary 
should be involved in the 
president's policy planning proc-
ess, so that "he'll know how to 
build the watch, not just how to tell 
the time." 

Gerald Ford's Press Secretary 
Jerald terHorst also said he had 
"no inkling" President Ford was 
planning to pardon fonner Presi-
dent Nixon for his part in Water-
gate until the evening before it was 
announced. 

The audience attending the 
taping applauded as terHorst ex-
plained that President Ford's 
"double standard of justice" in 
pardoning Nixon while others 
involved in the Watergate Scandal 
went to jail led to terHorst 's deci-
sion to resign his post as press 
secretary. 

Nessen, however, disagreed 

with terHorst' s decision to resign, 
pointing out that the "job of the 
press secretary is to go out there 
and explain the president 's posi-
tion," no matter what his own per-
sonal opinion might be. 

Powell noted that "you'd have 
to be a cretin not to have doubts 
about every decision that is made"

Salem's Lots 

Parking at UCSD 
Parking at UCSD is a nightmare. That 's not an ove rstatement; 

the inability to find decent parking spaces is a source of tremen-
dou frustration for students. Finding a place to park requires 
either parking very far away from clas , or taking the risk of not 
getting a space and cruising up and down the rows in one of the 
more central lots . 

There aren 't a 101 of solulions being considered by the admini-
tration. But there are some things that can be done immediately. 

The first is to revise the night and weekend parking regulations . 
The best way to revise them would be to abolish them, and 

return to the system of free parking during those lime . But if they 
are to be kept - and it is virtually certain they will be - there are 
orne changes that need to be made. One change would be to 

change the length of time a weekend parking parmit is valid (see 
the letter at right). 

Another problem with night parking is that it forces students 
to park far away from where Lhey are going. 111is isn ' ( just an in-

convenience; at night, it is poten-
tially dangerous. A partial olution to 
this would be to allow cars with per-
mits to park in metered spaces on 
nights and weekends. This would 
have very little effect on revenues, 
since most metered spaces are empty 
at night anyway. Moreover, it would 
solve one of the biggest inconven-
iences: the lack of spaces near the 
Price Cenler and the Student Center. 

Another problem is that although 
students are allowed to park in most 
non-metered spaces at night, there 

are two places off limits: " A" spaces with signs indicating they 
are enforced 24 hours, and reserved spaces . 

The "A" and reserved spaces sit empty all night. This is 
ridiculous and unnecessary. Forcing students to walk further in 
the dark all of the time so those with "A" and reserved permits 
won ' t have to walk once in a while is unfair. This should be 
changed immediately . 

These changes only begin to solve the problem; if students in 
the future have to wait for a shuttle in a dark lot, thi is an 
unacceptably unsafe situation. The real solution is to make more 
close parking available, all of the time. 

Reserved, numbered spaces sit empty most of the time. The 
parking coordinator at Arizona State University several years 
ago pointed out this was the biggest source of wasted parking 
there, and ASU had less reserved spaces than UCSD does. 
Reserved spaces should be abolished or severely reduced. 

In the longer term, parking structures hold out some hope. But 
these have been promised for a long time, so don't hold your 
breath. The current long term plan is to build more remote 
parking lots, and run shuttles to and from them. Parking struc-
tures will only be built when these possibilities are exhausted. 

Having structures low on the priority list is a serious error. In 
ten years, when the administration finds they have finally ex-
hausted all potential for distant parking and shuttles, it is likely 
they will look around and realize no space exists for the struc-
tures. In a campus with as much construction as UCSD, it is 
essential that the places be secured now for the parking struc-
tures. They can be built rapidly (albeit not inexpensively). 

There are many small ways to help. One is to encourage 
students to ride their bikes to campus. This would require a much 
more reasonable policy toward bike riding, and the construction 
of bike paths across the campus. This may be more expen ive 
than the benefits received, but the option should be explored. 

Just as many options should be explored. The master plan, un-
fortunately , places a low priority on parking. Parking is already 
a nightmare, but the evidence is that unless admini tration 
attitudes change, the situation will only get worse. 

t~E1TERS , 
Weekend Parking Permits Pose Problem 
Editor: 

I have a major complaint with 
the UCSD parking program. My 
friend came to visil me unexpect-
edly one weekend. 

They came on aturday morn-
ing and planned on leaving early 
Monday morning. For lwo dol-
lars, my visitors purchased a week-
end parking pass. 

Upon purchase they were told 
they had to be out of the parking 
lot by 7 a.m. Monday moming. 
Since they were planning on leav-
ing around 9 or 10 a.m. and did not 
wanl to receivea ticket, they asked 
what they should do. The response 
from one of lhe on-duty weekend 
people was to buy a half-day pass 
from the Parking and Transpona-
lion Office at 8 a.m. Monday. 

They were told lhey would have 
to get up and move their aulomo-
bile by 7 a.m. into a metered park-
ing space and could get a half-day 
pass at 8 a.m. , or they could keep 

feeding the meter until they lefl 
lhat moming. 

I find il ridiculous lhat there is 
no place on the weekend where 
you can purchase a parking permit 
to allow you to stay past 7 a.m. on 
Monday moming. 

It was absolutely outrageous 
that my friends had to get up so 
early in the moming to move their 
car, when they should have been 
able to rest a lillie longer before 

the eight -hourdrive ahead of them. 
I do not understand why the 

weekend parking people cannot 
be authorized to sell a Monday 
half-day permit. Maybe the 7 a.m. 
time limit could be eXlended to a 
more reasonable time for travel-
ing guests. Regardless, a solution 
is needed. There is no reason why 
a problem as simple as this cannot 
and should not be solved.

A New Name For Third? 
Editor: 

Lumumba-Zapata College? 
What a joke! This is the name 
proposed 20 years ago in an effort 
to have the new name for Third 
College reflect the ethnic diver-
sity present at Third. 

If one wants to reflect Third 's 
diversity, one can't only propose 
a Mexican and Congolese name. 
What about the people of Chinese 

origin? What of the Italians? The 
Soviets? The English? The Na-
tive Americans? The Japanese? 
The Vietnamese? The Scandina-
vians and so fonh? And why is 
this name reflective of only male 
accompli hments? I'm sure the 
female population of Third would 
also appreciate representation. Are 
we also to forget the Iiberdl and 
conservative population? And 
what of religious diversity? 

A.S. Vote Was Ridiculous Whom is the Third College administrdtion trying to kid? Third 
College represents diversity. Not 
one culture, gender, political af-
filiation or religion. If one tries to 
accommodate Third College's 
diversity by naming it after a per-
son, let me offer the only tangible 
solution: Pope Luigi Ming Run-
ning-Bull Mao Lumumba Ukhta 
Nisei Zapata Ross TheresaJ ackson 
College. 

Editor: 
This is a letter to the A.S. 

Council in regard to their voting 
against "Elvis Week" because 
someone heard he was a mcist. 

Stop taking yourselves so seri-
ously! Think about it. Because 
someone misinterpreted "Love Me 
Tender" as a mcial slur is no rea-
son not to have "Elvis Week." 
Now if Elvis was a racist, then I 
fully agree with the council's 
decision, but because someone 
heard in his neighbor's bathroom 
that he was a rdcist is ridiculous. 

Next time, please cite exact 
incidents that show Elvis was 
prejudiced. Many people say racist 
things once in a while, including 
the A.S . Council. I'm sure Elvis 
did the same. What makes him 
different? 

Elvis was a great singer and 
entenainer, not a member of the 
Ku Klux Klan. 

BENSON 

Personally, I don't care if we 
have "Elvis Week," but the reason 
for us not having it should not be 
because, to quote Darrin Malloy, 
"comments have been made that 
Elvis was a racist and we would be 
glorifying him." 

First of all, only comments were 
made--facts, from what I under-
stand, were not considered. Sec-
ondly, UCSDwouid not "glorify" 
Elvis; putting his face on Mt. 
Rushmore would be glorifying 
him. Malloy also stated that people 
would be upset. I am sorry to 
infom1 Mr. Malloy that my first 
thought about Elvis, or even my 
second thought, for that matter, 
isn' t, "That $#@?$ racist, what a 
jerk." 

Sorry. Next time, I hope the 
council has more fun with their 
decisions and stops taking them-
selves so seriously. 

Rob Goldstein 

Or why don't we quit fooling 
ourselves and stick wi th the name 
that got us through 20 years: Third. 
Third College is our name and it 
should stay that way .

PRESS: 10 
Speak Out 
continued from page 3 
by Ihe president. "There aren ' tany 
cookbook solulions." 

Several of the fonner press 
secretaries agreed thai, personal 
opinion aside, presidential image 
polishing played an importa!'t role 
in Iheir jobs. 

Beginning with Ford, Chancel· 
lor asked each secretary how he 
dealt with his presidenl's particu· 
lar image flaws. 

"Some described Ford as 
clumsy. How did you deal wilh 
this image problem?" Chancellor 
asked of Nessen. 

"In one word: unsuccessfully." 
Nessen answered. 

"My experience trying to tum 
around the image of Gerald Ford 
ought to end once and for all Ihe 
idea that we are great manipulators 
of Ihe press. 

"In our efforts to have the presi· 
dent appear in presidential situ· 
ations. we went to extremes Ihat 
now seem silly. like the annual 
presentation of the national turkey 
just before Thanksgiving," Nessen 
said. 

Salinger noted that each press 
secretary's "job is totally linked to 
the menlality of the man he works 
for." 

He added that Kennedy "could 
have been his own press secretary 
if he had time to do it." 

In the same analytical style in 
which he narrates his many public 
television specials. President 
Johnson's Press Secretary Bill 
Moyers pointed out that press sec· 
retaries "are pontificators in that 
we build bridges between the presi. 
dent and the press .... We are 
charged with trying to report the 
presidency to the press, and, con-
versely, our job is to try to report 
the reporters to the president." 

Powell pointed out that "if on 
the whole. things are going well. in 
so far as the public 's judgement-
and the public does tend to concen· 
trate on the more important things. 
like war. peace. and pocketbooks. 
- then the trivial aspects of a 
presidency don't matter. When they 
do start mattering, they aren't the 
real problems of a presidency; they 
are only symptoms of a grealer 
problem," Powell said. . 

Nessen agreed. saying that some 
of the image problems the presi· 
dents experienced were "because 
of the times we lived in. and be· 
cause of the events that transpired 
that made people lose faith and 
gain contempt for their leaders." 

Besides. said Speakes, Reagan' s 
fonner spokesman, "Presidents 
make mistakes, and they can't 
know everything." 

"Some more than others ." 
Chancellor quipped. 

Johnson 's Press Secretary 
James Reedy, commented that "the 
president is the United States for 
the years he is in office. and if he 
takes the country further than the 
people are willing to go, then dis· 
aster is going to set in. That is what 
happened in Johnson's case--the 
people simply were not willing to 
swallow Vietnam. 

''I'm not so sure about even 
wartime lies," he continued, add· 
ing that of len only the American 
people do not know the truth of the 
situation. 

"We had bases in Thailand . . . 
everyone knew we had bases in 
Thailand exce pt Ihe American 
people. who were footing the bill. 

"In the modern world there 
aren'tanymore ecrets. Theageof 
secrecy is gone." Reedy said.

Years, One Class Is Coming To An Untimely End 

The Fall of the Wild 
·Story By Adam Levy, Stat/Writer 

Wilderness and Human Values or C120, a class with a 
legacy of 17 years, has come to an end, according to Dr. 
James Stewart. the fonner Muir provost who led the cla s. 
The class was popular for combin ing a diverse array of guest 
lecturers on the environment with the outdoor experience. 

tudent to lead their own personalized ection on specific 
environmental topic . 

Stewart , who came out of retirement for two years to lead 
the class, said it would be difficult to find someone who 
would devote the required time to the class. 

According to Stewart, one of the key elements that made 
the clas upique, as well as time consuming, was the focus on 
the ections, led by undergraduate student . Teaching as ' is-

3-D Paintings Displayed at Mandeville Gallery 
Artist Calls His 
Work 'Yuppie Art' 

Twenty of James Trivers' paint-
ings will be exhibited at the Man-
deville Gallery from Jan. 10 to 
Feb. 18, in a show titled "Double 
Feature." 

The works are from two series: 
"The History of Art in 3-D" and 
"Issues Without Answers." They 
are meant to be viewed with the aid 
of plastic 3-D glasses. The two 
series were painted over two years . 

Paintings from the series "The 

History of Art in 3-D" include such 
titles as "Monet/Manet," "3-
DaVinci," and "Lust for Life in 3-
D." The works appear to contain 
familiar historical art images 
painted by European masters; Triv-
ers has Venus rising from the half-
hell with a two-color outline 

familiar to 3-D comic book read-
ers. When the glasses are worn, 
the works give a second, "hidden" 
meaning. The series comments on 
how our culture uses its visual 
images. 

The "Issues Without Answers" 
eries is Trivers' most recent group 

of works. In it, he comments on the 
presentation of the daily news and 
advertising in our culture, with such 
works as "The Culture of Narcis-
sism," "Prevention of Sexually 
Transmitted Diseases ," "Learn 
English in Your Sleep," and "The 
Betty Ford Clinic." 

Trivers , from Los Angeles, said 
he likes his paintings to tell stories, 
and to have them look back at the 
viewer. The 3-D glasses, he said, 
are less a gimmick than a high 
aesthetic experience. 

"I think art itselfisagimmick, a 
fashion show," he said. "I was 

reacting against yuppie an when I 
did the series. Now it is yuppie 
art." 

Trivers has a degree in art his-
tory and a background of juvenile 
fiction writing, screen writing, and 
acting. He recently sold a script 
idea for a "Matlock" episode. His 
works have been shown at NEWS-
PACE, in Los Angeles, since the 
early 1980s. 

The Mandev ille Gallery is open 
Tuesday through Sunday, from 
noon to 5 p.m. A reception for the 
artist will take place at the gallery 
on Jan. I, from 6-8 p.m.

UC Space 
Plan: Mars 
by 1997 
By ALLEN HUE 
Daily Californiall 

BERKELEY- A small band of 
think tank scientists at the UC-
managed Lawrence Livermore 
National Laboratory has proposed 
an ambitious plan to send human 
explorers to Mars in less than a 
decade. 

Dubbed the "Great Exploration" 
by researchers Lowell Wood, Yuki 
Ishikawa, and Rod Hyde, the plan 
would cost les than $1 billion a 
year and u e only existing tech-
nologies. 

"We already have in hand what 
we need for the great exploration 
of the inner solar sy tem," Wood 
said in a proposal presented to the 
National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration (NASA). 

The researchers said their mis-
sion blueprints make impractical 
current NASA plans, which entail 
a three-decade timeframe and 
would cost $400 billion. 

Impatient with the lumbering 
bureaucracy of the U.S. govern-
ment's space program, the scien-
tists described their aggressive plan 
as "maximally time-compressed" 
and "reward and risk- intensive." 

The plan would establish an 
Earth-orbiting space station in three 
years, a lunar base with a fuel-
producing factory in five years, 
and a final landing on Mars in 
seven years. 

The first part of the Great Ex-
ploration sends an inflatable space 
station almost 200 miles into orbit 
around the Earth via an expend-
able rocket in 1992. 

The orbiting station - inflat-
able to save space, fuel, and money 
- would consist of standardized 5 
by 15 meter sausage-shaped habi-
tation modules, which would be 
tightly folded and interconnected 
upon launch. 

Described by the scientists as a 
"community-sized space suit," the 
modules would be made ofkelvar, 
the material used in making bullet-
proof vests. 

The station would serve as a 
base of operations beyond the large 
pull of gravity near the Earth's 
surface. 

It would also serve as a fueling 
station, where plain water sent up 
from the ground could be con-
vened to hydrogen and oxygen. 

An inflatable moon base would 
be established in 1994, launched 
from the Earth and refueled at the 
Earth-orbiting space station. 

The base, consisting of the stan-
dard habitation modules, would be 
indefinitely self-sufficient and "this 
time[here] to stay," Wood com-
mented. 

A greenhouse would be erected 
upon arrival, along with a lunar 
fuel factory, which could recover 
valuable raw materials from the 
lunar soil. 

See MARS, page 9 

Monday, January 8, 1989 

Mars 
Continued from page 8 

The factory roasts I unar soil at 
temperatures up to 1,000 degrees 
centigrade - using solar and, 
later, nuclear power - to liberate 
hydrogen, oxygen, carbon diox-
ide, water, and nitrogen. 

Wood said the abundance of 
these materials in the moon's soil 
is known from analyses conducted 
during the Apollo missions in the 
early '70s. 

An expedition to Mars would 
depart from Earth in 1997, refuel-
ing at either the orbiting space sta-
tion or lunar base to make the 305-
day flight. 

The explorers would establish a 
base on the planet 's surface with 
two pairs of habitation modules 
and stay for 399 days to collect 
data and look for life forms. 

Re-entry to the earth would be 
in the style of the Apollo missions, 
with a marine retrieval. 

Subsequent Mars expeditions 
would follow the same procedure. 
Other interplanetary missions are 
also on the drawing board. 

"The thrust is swift explora-
tion, settlement, and infrastruc-
ture creation," Wood said. 

The scienti ts compared their 
proposal to the conquering of 
Antarctica and the American West, 
with the emphasis on exploration 
rather than science. 

"Science happens as scientists 
follow," Wood explained. 

The type , of person to be en-
listed on the mission should be a 
"pioneer, not a junketeer," Wood 
said. "Bravery, not risk adversity, 
is the essential attribute of great 
ex:plorers. " 

Wood said space flights will be 
scheduled during times of low 
space radiation levels, and the space 
station will be equipped with an 
emergency shelter enclosed in 
water tanks, which will provide 
"perfect" protection during solar 
storms. 

In addition, a layerof lunar soil 
will be "snow-blown" over the 
habitation modules to provide 
radiation shielding similar to the 
ozone layer on Earth.

posure. 

However, a recent Soviet ex-
periment successfully landed a man 
after a year in earth orbit. 

The Mars flight would take less 
time, Wood added. 

"Time is the enemy. There has 
never been a successful 25- to 30-
year federal technology program," 
Wood countered. "Technically, 
Mars is no harder to get to than is 
the moon."

Leddin also said he is propos-
ing a new class on environmental 
issues that would use existing fac -
ulty at UCSD but would probably 
abandon the discussion leaders and 
sections that were present in the 
old class. 

A group of UCSD students, 
many of whom led discussion sec-
tions, has, however petitioned to 
retain the class in its old form. 
About 500 signatures were ob-
tained and presented to Leddin.

In discussing why the sections 
were important, Bunon said the 
"bonding" of the students was an 
important part of the learning 
experience. He also emphasized

lUu tralions by Tony Fuentes 

Mo nday, January 8, 19 89 

Class 
Continued from page 9 
discussion leaders and sections 
would deprive students of the as-
pects that made CI20 unique. 

Julia Roelofcommented on the 
infonnality of the section she led. 

" A couple of our sections were 
at my house, and you have ones 
outside. It's acompletely different 
atmosphere," she said. 

In addition to meeting for sec-
tions each week, Burton pointed 
out that class members went on 
frequent camping trips together, 
including a final trip to Mono Hot 
Springs. This furthered bonding 
and friendship, he said. 

What was most exhilarating, 

Roelof said, was "getting to know 
my section, hearing their opinions 
and seeing them get excited about 
what was goi ng on in class." She 
also nOled that the atmosphere al-
lowed for truly open in-depth 
conversations. 

Gary Mihelic, a student who 
took CI20, cited the different view-
points expressed as a memorable 
aspect of the class. 

"I like that it wasn't one sided," 
Mihelic said. "It gave a good broad 
look at a lot of important issues 
that surround the environment." 

Theildministration does realize 
the importance of the class, said 
Stewart. 

-'It was recognized as a very 
valuable course, and so for two 

The UCSD G uardian 

years they brought me back from 
retirement," he continued. 

Stewart lamented the fact that 
Iheclass was so dependent on him, 
and that there was no one to take it 
over, but he recognized that only a 
provost without the pressures of 
being a full-time faculty member 
could spend the amount of time 
needed. 

In regard to having a regular 
faculty member teach the class, 
Stewart pointed out that such a 
person would have to spend half 
his time doing research, in addi-
tion to spending time with gradu-
ate students. 

As a provost, Stewart aid he 
had more time than a regular fac-
ulty member because provosts are 

not required to do research and are 
able to teach any classes they wish. 

Stewart concluded that il would 
be difficult for a regular professor 
to assume the demands of the class 
in its present fonn. 

Leddin recognized that the sec-
tions were part of the class's cen-
tral fabric. 

In adQition, Leddin said that the 
hiring of a new faculty member 
specifically to teach the class 
"would not be a very high prior-
ity," because of the scarcity and 
the high demand of new faculty 
positions. 

" It could only be taught in a 
certain mode, and when that wasn't 
possible, the course had to change," 
Leddin said. 

FEATURES 13 

In reflecting on the overall 
purpose of CI20, Stewart pointed 
out that it promoted activism. He 
said student could take any stand 
they wanted as long as they look a 
stand. 

The final project for the class 
consisted of an action that in some 
way backed up the student's view-
point towards the environment and 
a paper discussing the origin of the 
student's attitudes. 

"Most of the time, students deal 
with the course material objec-
tively, as sul1ject malter," Leddin 
said. "In this class, we then said, 
'now put this subject matter to 
work, especially upon yourself and 
your relationship to the natural

While the Tritons waited for the 
Bearcat shooters to lip back to 
reality. UCSD managed to stay 
within eight points for the majority 
of the first half by shooting a re-
spectable 46 percent. But Willam-
ette kept raining in shot from 
everywhere on the court , and 
stretched its lead to 45-33 at the 
half. 

The Triton wa ted no time in 
the econd half. and streaked to 
within one with a 19-8 tear. While 
the Bearcat shooters went into a 
temporary slump, UCSD did some 
serious board-banging, creating a 
blazing array of fast-breaks and

complete with dean, resident dean, 
and a plethora of house a dvisors-
clad almost entirely in green. 

At that instant, I was thankful 
that the University of La Verne 
Leopards - a ri val school that has 
green as one of its primary colors 
- wasn ' t one of the teams in the 
tournament. The Leopards would 
have thought they had quite a fol-
lowing. I can ' t imagine how con-
fused the other schools in the tour-
nament must have been. 

After the halftime contest. 
UCSD Public Address Announcer 
Matt Adams announced that the 
Spirit Night winner would be an-
nounced later in the game. It was a 
good thing. Had Adams revealed 
the winner right then, there may 
have been a mass exodus. 

This so-called spirit got so out 
of hand. I kept expecting Adams to 
announce something like: "Basket 
by number 35, Gordon McNeill. 
THIRD COLLEGE!!!" 

That announcement might have 
sparked some interest in the game. 
The Third students would have 
had something to really cheer 

open shot . 
The Bearcatshooters, however, 

quickly regained their firs t-half 
fonn and did not pennit the Triton 
charge to shake them. As time 
ticked away, the Tritons began a 
full-court press, but were consis-
tently assessed with fouls as they 
attempted to create turnovers. 
UCSD's aggressive play put Wit-
lamette on the free-throw line for 
one-and-ones. The Bearcats capi-
talized on the Tritons' charity, hit-
ting 16 of 22 from the stripe. 

Triton Head Coach Tom 
Marshall commented on 
Willamette's ability to maintain its 
poise despite his squad's second-
half surge. 

"If there is one thing that Wil-

about, rather than the evidently 
mindless action on the court. 

Or better yet, maybe UCSD 
should organize a "1990 Major 
Night," ora "1990 Year-in-School 
Night," so the stands could be 
divided by major or year instead of 
by college. Or maybe they should 
combine them all into one. I can 
see it now .. . 

The undeclared second-year 
Warren College students and the 
first-year Muir College communi-
cation majors would comprise 
fairly large rooting sections, but 
the sixth-year Revelle College 
visual arts majors would, most 
likely, be in the minority. Adams 
would have a particularly difficult 
time: 

"Basket by number 22, Tim 
Rapp, Warren College, third-year, 
POLl SCI!!!" 

Now Ihalwould epitomize what 
this school is all about. That would 
show some true blue school spirit. 

Or perhaps some true green 
school spirit. 

A "Spiri t Night" should strike 
at the very heart of school unity. 
But at UCSD, "Spirit Night" de-
feats the purpose e ntirely. It's re-
ally no wonder UCSD students 

lamette had that we couldn't stop, 
it's mental toughness. That's the 
key to their team," Marshall ex-
plained. "They just keep playi ng 
their game no matter what you do 
to them. We are a very good team 
right now, but we have to bring our 
play up another level if we want to 
consistently beat teams like Wil-
lamette." 

Rapp and McNeill again led 
UCSD scorers wi th 20 and 21 
points. respectively. and each 
earned a spot on the All-Tourna-
ment team. Rounding out the tour-
nament selections were 
Claremont's Henry Albrecht, and 
Ted Harris and Tournament MVP 
Erik Clarkson of Willamette, who 
had 55 points on the weekend. 

complain about a lack of school 
spirit. 

When student graduate from 
UCSD, they will more likely be 
proud of the university they gradu-
ate from, rather than their college. 

"Warren College" doesn't hold 
a lot of weight when applying to 
graduate school or on a resume. 
The University of California, San 
Diego, now one of the nation's 
leading univer ities, holds a great 
deal of weight. 

After some initial uncertainty. 
the surprising 1989-90 UCSD 
men's basketball team - now 10-
4 - is on the brink of establishing 
itself as a force in Division m. 
This team is good - really good, 
in fact - and it deserves fans who 
attend the game to root for the 
team, not fortheirspecific college. 

There were only a handful of 
people who deserved kudos for 
their outward UCSD support, 
namely the pep band, the cheer-
leaders, and the crazy guy who 
transforms himself into a living 
earthquake on the gym floor. But 
these guys are usually there. . 

Incidentally, UCSD defeated 
Bethany Bible, 92-74.·

This weekend the UCSD lri-
tons invited three rival NCAA 
swim teams and a host of young 
U .S . senior swimmers to the 
Canyon view Pool. But the Tri-
tons were hardly hospitable. as 
both the UCS D men's and 
women's teams triumphed over 
Fresno State, Cal State Bak-
ersfield. and San Francisco State 
- Division J and II teams - in 
the San Diego Senior Invitational. 

The tt"ms' achievements in-
clude qualifying three Triton 
women and seven men for nation-
als, and having several swimmers 
turn in multiple-win perform-
ances. 

The day ' s most notable per-
formances belonged to Greg 
Goodrich, who swam to a first 
place ranking among Division 1II 
competitors, and Jason Vance, 
'yho secured three spots for him-
self at Nationals. 

Leading the women's qualify-
ing effort. Erin Bakey and Alice 
Kirby both swam to qualifying 
times in the 200 yard breast stroke, 
with clockings of 2:30.46 and 
2:32.09. respectively. Sabrina 
Steiner's time of 18: 18.53 in the 
1650 freestyle qualified her for 
nationals as well. 

Three Triton men also "uained 
national qualifying times in the 
1650 frees!yle : Dave Sacco 
clocked il1 at 16:07.88. whi:e 
Mark Fahlen and Chris Carillo 
tied at 16:33.34. Also clinching a 
spot on the Triton Ndtionalteam 
was Pete Smith, who won the 200 
yard individual medley in 
1:56.79. 

Vance sprinted to a national 
qualifying time ir. both the 50 
yard freestyle (21 31). the 100 
yard backstroke (54.46), and the 
200 yard backstroke ~ I :57.57). 
Goodrich clocked in a qualifying 
timeinthe 100 backstroke, touch-
ing in at 53 .12, which ranks him 
fir t atop the nation among Divi-
sion m swimmers in that event. 

In addition, three Triton relay 
teams attained national time stan-
dards at the meet. The women's 
400 freestyle relay (3:41.53) and 
both the men's and women's 400 
medley relay (4 :09.23 and 
3 :33.74, respectively) will head 
for nationals together. 

Catherine Capriles, who is 
currently ranked first in Division 
III in the 200 individual medley, 
captured the event with a time of 
2: 10.12. She won the 100 and 
200 yard backstrokes as well. 
clocking in at 58.69 and 2:07.36, 
respectively. 

Sabrina Lum raced to a first 

place finish in the 400 individual 
medley (4:46.22), the 100 yard 
butterfly (58.93), and the 200 yard 
butterfly (2:09.15 . She hold 
down first place I 3tional rank-
ings in both butterfly events 
among Division fJf s·vimmers.

UCS' Head Coach Bill Mor-
gan was eXl,;ited about tile team 's 
performance this weekend . com-
rnentingthat the swimmerr turned 
out som'! real ·'eye-openers ." 
After training long and grueling 
hours over the winter break, none 
of the swimmers were rested or 
shaved for the meet. 

"This gave us the opportunity 
to see who could sustain three 
days worth of competition with 
trials and finals. I'm extremely 
pleased with the efforts," Morgan 
said. "Swimming is a sport 
wherein hard work and consis-
tency find its rewards later on in 
the season. Our hard work is being 
paid off early, which is great.·' 

The meet scheduled for this 
Wednesday against Wyoming has 
been cancelled. UCSD will com-
pete in another meet against 
Fresno State next Tuesday. 

UCSD SCOI ing leader Cari 
Young(14poinr ), andfellowcen-
ters Bernadette Diepenbrock and 
Lisa Beaver, each with II , were 
the main beneficiariesofCaparaz's 
work down the ~tretch . 

" We didn ' t feally run a set of-
fense , but the fast-breaking worked 
because i1 didn't allow [LFC] to 
play defense." Triton Head Coach 
Judy Malone explained. 

fhe Tritons, especially Scott 
and Ely, managed to squeeze in 
erne tough defense. playing what 

Ma'onecalled "The best help-and-
gu-back defense I've ever seen 
women play." 

They shut down LFC' s AlI-
American forward Jill Morrison, 
who average 23 ppg, 10 a measly 
four points on 1- 12 shooting. 

"We weren't intimidated at all. 
We knew they had an All-Ameri-
can, but we said 'So what? '" Al-
varez said. "We 're learning not to 
be timid." 

The "So what?" attitude could 
have applied to yesterday 's 26-
point maiming of the napless Santa 
Cruz Banana Slug~ . 

Even though Malone clai ms that 
the Slugs are better than last year, 

Young contributed 14points and 
seven rebounds, and reserve for-
wards Scott and Serena Murillo 
added II and I,D points, respec-
tively.Scottalsonabbedfive teals.

But did MuirCollege really care who

concerning Spirit Night begins. "We

One sentence about the game - the

I was late getting to the game. Head-

A Classic Split for the Tritons 

Men's Hoop Crushes 
Bethany Bible by 21; 
Falls to Willamette 
By ERIC BROSIO 
StajfWriter 

After driving to wins in six of its last 
even games, including Friday night 's thrash-

ing of Bethany Bible College in the fir t 
round, UCSD' men 's basketball team 
looked to cruise to the 1990 La 10lla Classic 
Championship. The Bearcat of Willam-
ette, however, threw a wrench into what has 
been a mooth-running Triton machine, de-
feating UCSD 86-75 in Saturday night 's 
champion hip match. 

The host Tritons got off to an auspicious 
tart in Friday' s "Spirit Night" game by 

pummeling Bethany Bible, a chool that de-
feated UCSD last ea on. In what was a 
decidedly one-sided conte t, the Tritons sank 
17 point before Bethany even got on the 
board and coasted toa94-73 victory, upping 
their record to 10-3. 

UCSD's leading scorer, Tim Rapp, led 
all scorer with 32 points, and center Gor-
don McNeill added 15 of his own a the 
Tritons earned a pot in the ti tIe game against 
Willamette, which defeated Claremont 82-

I 63 in its first round contest. 

Greg Benes/Guardian 

Gordon McNeill, who scored 36 total points this weekend, helped the Tritons hold 
onto an easy 94-73 "Spirit Night" win over Bethany Bible College in the main gym. 

The Triton (currently 10-4) matched up 
well against Willamette - a tough NAJA 
squad - which did not have a distinct 
height or speed advantage. What the Bear-
cats did have, however, was an astounding 
field goal shooting percentage. It seemed as 
if they couldn't miss from anywhere, in-
cluding behind the three-point line, where 
they hi ton 62 percent of their shots. Wi Ilam-
ette guard Ted Harris was perfect - 5-5 -
from three-point land.

"Timber!" 
That was the appropriate shout 

on Saturday aftemoon, as the UCSD 
women's basketball team felled the 
previously unbeaten Lady Forest-
ers of Lake Forest College, 77-59. 

The sound defeat of the now 9-1 
visitors from Illinois wa particu-

Point Loma Nazarene, a team that 
downed the young Tritons by 14 in 
the season opener, earlier in the

burrier for the fir t time this season 
with a 74-48 thumping ofUC Santa

On Saturday, both teams came 
out running, but the scoring still

UCSD 's last 10 points of the half. 

The second half began as a copy 
of the first , when UCSD freethrows 
and Lady Forester baskets were 
traded over the first five minute. 
UCSD maintained its advantage in a 
fast-break game that still had a few 
physical moments. 

The physical play led LFC Head 
Coach Jackie Slaats to be slapped 
with a technical for letting the refe-
rees know what he thought of their 
calls at the 15:24 mark. 

"The referees ' style hurt us, We're

one of their taller players is blatantly 
over-the-back, it doesn' t help us at 
all when it isn' t called. We ' re a fi -

Slaats said.

Its bi ggest lead of the game at 46-35.
