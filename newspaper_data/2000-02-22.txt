BEIJING - Less than one 
~on_th before presidential elec-
tions in Taiwan, the Chinese gov-
ernment on Monday released the 
bluntest warning yet that it will 
not- wait indefinitely for the 
island to reunite with the main-
land, declaring that a prolonged 
lack of negotiations, in itself, 
could provoke a military attack. 

The Chinese have long made it 
clear that any moves by Taiwan 
toward formal independence 
would lead to war.

McCain's high command hud-

plotting their latest move to stop

They fretted that Bush had 
been scheduled to appear first on 
NBC's "Today" program on 
Monday, folloWed by McCain. No 
way, they decided. McCain would 
go first on the highest rated morn-

said his performance lacked enthusiasm, energy and good songs. 

WINTERFEST 2000 
Cooiio, Buck-O-Nine and Ozomatli perform before 2,500 people 
Staf'~er 

Buck-O-Nine, Coolio and 
Ozomatli played to a crowd of 
over of 2,500 students last 
Friday as part of Winterfest 
2000 held at RlMAC Arena. 

"Overall I think it went 
really well," said Scott 
Mantell, A.S. programmer and 
organizer of the event. "It 
looked like many students had 
a really good time." 

Mantell said Buck-O-Nine 
provided the audience with a 
very good performance and 
attributed the low attendance 
at their show to the perfor-
mance time. 

"I wish more could have 
heard [Buck-O-Ninel play," he 
said. "They had a really great 
performance with a lot of ener-
gy." 

Marshall freshman Eric 
Robin said he agreed with 
Mantell's assessment of Buck-
O-Nine, but wished the band 
would have started their per-
formance later. 

"Buck-O-Nine did a really 
~ood job on Friday," he said. 
'The only problem is that I 
couldn't get there until 7:45 
p.m. and J missed half of their 
performance." 

Mantell said that in the 
future, Wmterfest will begin at 
a later time so that more pe0-
ple will be in the audience for 
the opening band. 

"It is a shame that we had 
such a small turnout," Mantell 
said. "Next year we will start 
the show later so that the time 
doesn't affect the turnout." 

In addition, many were 
impressed and surprised by 
Ozomatli's performance, as 

their music was mostly 
unknown the crowd. 

"Ozomatli did a really good 
job,"Marshall freshman Adam 
Huie said. "Even though I did-
n't know who they were until 
the show started, I am glad 
they played." 

Mantell said he was 
pleased by Ozomatli's perfor-
mance as well and enjoyed the 
whole experience of working 
with them. 

"I think they are a band that 
a lot more people should know 
about," he said. 

Mantell said Ozomatli 
arrived on campus early 
Friday afternoon and began to 
play outside their van amid 
spectato~s who were enjoying 
the musIc.

AS. Council 
Passes New 
Constitution 
CHANGE: Document 
takes voting power away 
from commissioners 
BY MAn ICIIRADIR 
Staff Writer 

After months of editing, 
reworking and debating. the A.S. 
Council passed its new constitu-
tion on Feb. 16. . 

"I am really happy it hap-
pened:' A.S. President Tesh 
Khullar said. "The changes we 
made were really important for 
the students of this school." 

Khullar said the most impor-
tant change for the students is 
that the four commissioners serv-
ing on the A.S. Council will now 
be appointed by the council 
instead of elected as in previous 
years. 

"This will be the best thing for 
the students because I gain noth-
ing by not appointing the best 
person for the job," he said. 

Khullar said that in previous 
years, presidents co!lld attempt to 
get commissioners elected who 
would always vote in their favor. 
With the new changes to the con-
stitution, the entire council 
appoints the most qualified per-
son for the job. 

"Things become a' lot more 
efficient because these commis-
sioners always know what is 
going on," Khullar said. 

In addition, the commissioner 
of communications is no longer a 
position on the A.S. Council 
because the title demanded little 
work. 

"Tesh and I were talking and 
we decided that my position isn't 

. necessary anymore:' said Bobby 
Kim, the current commissioner of 
communications, at last 
Wednesday's A.S. Council meet-

At one point more than 400 

people crowded a regents meet-

attend the meeting. leaving the 
vote 12-0.

FORUM: Nine participants, all vying for the city's top spot, discussed the area's role in the global economy 

Staff~er 

Nine of the 12 candidates for 
San Diego mayor debated on 
global topics such as NAFTA and 
maritime trade Thursday night at 
UCSD's Mandeville Auditorium. 

Jim Bell, Loch David Crane, 
Peter Q. Davis, Janice Jordan, Dick 
Murphy, Ron Roberts, George 
Stevens, Barbara Warden and 
Byron Wear aired their views in 
the debate which focused on San 
Diego's role in the global econo-
my. Foremost on the minds of the 

candidates was the issue of 
healthier trade with Mexico, in 
light of the North American Free 
lrade Agreement as the first step 
in fully joining the global econo-
my. 

"We must establish a relation-
ship with Mexico, not at the time 
we want to be trading. but at the 
time that begins right now," 
Stevens said. "Our relationship 
with Mexico is not very positive 
because of some of the issues 
that are taking place. Also, we 
need a free trade zone. We must 
establish a minimum wage with-

in that free trade zone." 
Bell expressed a desire for the 

same healthy trade with Mexico 
and others but said he felt that it 
should be encouraged with cau-
tion. 

"One of the things 1 want to 
ensure is that we don't have run-
away trade, in the sense that it is 
basically turning our environ-
ment into artifacts that will end 
up in a landfill," Bell said. "So 
what I would like to do is encour-
age trade with countries that have 
sustainable economies. That 
means that we use their resources 

in ways that do not diminish its 
productive potential." 

Jordan said that the issue is 
also a humanitarian one. 

''This is a big issue for me 
because I think NAFrA has a 
major role in this," Jordan said. 
"What I've seen happen since Jan. 
1, 1994 is the exploitation of work-
ers on both sides. We need to treat 
our neighbors to the south as peo-
ple. We have taken away the liv-
able wages and union wages from 
the people that live in the United

CONCERT: 
Coolio petfonned 
with a sprained ankle 
ContInued from ..... 1 
incredible," he said. "It just goes to 
show you that those guys were in 
it for the music and the message 
that it brings about having a good 
time." 

However, most were not as 
happy with the performance 
Coolio gave, as many said it 
lacked enthusiasm, energy and a 
high number of good songs. 

"I wish he didn't talk as 
much," Festivals Coordinator 
Aetna Wun said. "He hadn't per-
formed in a while and y,0u could 
tell he was a little rusty. ' 

Mantell said Coolio sprained 
his ankle before the show and 
was unable to move around as 
much as he would have wantfd. 

"Coolio was late getting there, 
and there was a lack of energy in 
his perfonnance probably beCause 
he was hurt," Mantell said. 

Mantell said he was happy 
with the concert, considering the 
lack of other performers available 
at this time. 

"No one is touring this quar-
ter," he continued. " I looked 
around at the trices and the 
availability, an things didn't 
look good." 

Neither Coolio nor Ozomatli 
were touring this quarter but 
were enticed to perform at 
Winterfest, according to Mantell. 

Despite the names of the 
bands that came to UCSD, Wun 
did not expect such a high num-
ber of people to attend. 

"I was really surprised by the 
number of people there," she 
said. "There were probably 2,500 
to 3,000 people." 

According to Mantell, the large 
number of students in attendance 
was a pleasant surprise for a 
three-day weekend, as the school 
was able to collect many cans of 
food for the St. Vincent De Paul 
Church. Although the concert was 
free for UCSD students, each stu-
dent was advised to bring at least 
one canned good. 

"Almost everyone brought at 
least one can," Mantell said, "but 
many brought whole bags." 

In addition, student organiza-
tions on Thursday and Friday of 
last week conducted a small 
canned food drive at the Price 
Center between 10 a.m. and 2 
p.m. The organizations with the 
most cans received $300, $200 
and $100, respectively. 

Two UCSD bands, the 
Charismatics and FON, per-
formed at the Price Center on 
Friday as well. 

For the first time since 
Winterfest's inception three years 
ago, the A.5. Council and Rock 
Bottom did not sponsor a beer 
garden to give away free beer to 
students over 21 . Mantell said he 
believed this conflicted with 
UCSD's message concerning 
drinking and concerts. 

According to Wun, the alcohol 
was not necessary at Wmterfest, 
and the activities that surround-
ed it, were very successful. 

Mantell said Wun was pivotal 
in the concert's success, helping 
with the booking of the bands that 
made the concert so musically 
diverse.

Clinton's Proposed Budget Bears Out Old Trepidations 
COMMENTARY: The president's proposal seeks to solve national problems with massive spending and little thought 

Senior Staff Ktiter 

When Arkansas Gov. Bill 
Clinton made his first bid for the 
presidency of the United States in 
1992, Republicans warned the 
American people that if they 
elected Gov. Clinton they would 
get an archetypal tax-and-spend 
Democrat. Willi the release of the 
president's eighth and final bud-
get proposal - which seeks to 
spend $1.84 trillion - those same 
Republicans can only be saying, 
"1 told you so." 

In an effort to improve his 
marred legacy, Clinton's proposal 
asks Congress to accelerate gov-
emment spending by a phenome-
nal 3.8 percent. Included in the 
3.8 percent increase is the exten-
sion of the solvency of Social 
Security until 2054 and Medicare 
until 2025. Solvency, however, 
does not mean reform. 

Ttie ·proposed budget also 
includes the newly popular idea 
of the government paying for 
prescription drugs. The price tag 
for the president's prescription 
drug plan is $98 billion. The 
budget also includes $20.9 biJ-
lion for medical care for veter-
ans, $35 billion for catastrophic 
health care protections for 
seniors, $23.6 billion to expand 
the earned income tax credit, $27 
million for the president's Equal 
Pay Initiative, $1.75 billion for 
class size reduction, 51 billion 
for after-school programs and 

$30 billion for college opportuni-
ties. The president's politically 
attractive wish list goes on and 
on. 

Congressional Republicans 
in both the House of 
Representatives and the Senate 
contend that the president's 
budget is little more than a polit-
ical tool designed to appeal to 
every constituency in the 
Democratic party in order to 
help elect Clinton's heir appar-
ent, Al Gore. 

The president is allocating 
American taxpayer dollars to win 
the support of advocacy groups 
such as labor unions, teachers' 
unions and the American 
Association of Retired Persons. 
By all accounts, the general elec-
tion for Clinton's successor will 
be a hard fought one, and the vice 
president wilT need all of the help 
he can get. Gore's cause is not 
helped by the issues his 
Democratic challenger Bill 
Bradley has brought up, includ-
ing campaign fund-raising scan-
dals. Clearly Clinton is more than 
willing to use his powerful office 
to buy support for the man who 
helped defend him during his 
impeachment. 

Throughout his administra-
tion, Ointon claimed to be a "new 
Democrat" who contended with 
his Democrat colleagues in their 
support of big government and 
big spending. Looking at hi$ cur-
rent proposal, one has to wonder 
how "new" the president really is. 

The Clinton budget has an 
answer to all of America's prob-
lems', both foreign and domestic. 
That answer is more spending by 
an ever-growing government. It 
suggests that money be thrown 
not only to Social Security and 
Medicare but also to computer 
hackers, handgun registration 

The president thumbs his 
nose not only at the 
military, but also at 
American taxpayers -
the hard-working people 
who will be footing the 
bill for the president's 
liberal spending spree. 
Simple analysis (not 
Republican rhetoric) 
shows that the American 
taxpayer does need a 
break.

East peace solution and Kosovo. 
The proposal contains a whop-
ping 83 new government pro-
grams, while cracking the spend-
ing cap agreed upon by the GOP 
and the president in 1997's bal-
anced budget. 

Although the proposal seeks 
to spend money left and right,

for America's defense. For a pres-
ident who has demonstrated fre-
quent willingness to send 
America's military to every little 
hot spot in the world, it would 
seem he would be a strong advo-
cate of the miJitary in this time of 
great economic prosperity. 
However, as American GIs have 
to live off food stamps and the 
military's morale is at a historic 
low, the president effectively 
leaves out the interests of the 
same soldiers he was willing to 
send into battle. 

According to the Washington 
Times, Clinton's budget for 
America's defense spending is 
less than 3 percent of the gross 
domestic product. The last time 
the defense budget was so low 
was 1940- the year before Japan 
attacked Pearl Harbor. To say the 
president's proposal for military 
spending is irresponsible would 
be an understatement. 

The president thumbs his nose 
not only at the military, but also at 
American taxpayers - the hard-
working people who will be foot-
ing the bill for the president's Iib-. 
eral spending spree. Simple 
analysis (not Republican rhetoric) 
shows that the American taxpay-
er does need a break. Over the 
next 10 years, the United States' 
coffers will be filled with $24 tril-
lion. The president's proposal 
will cut taxes by $351 billion over 
that same period of time. That tax 
cut does not even amount to a 
reduction of two-tenths of 1 per-

cent. 
The definition of a tax cut is 

also debatable. If the president 
gets his way, the American tax-
payer may not even get to enjoy 
that minuscule reduction. 
Included in the $351 billion is a . 
$53 billion sum that is ear-
marked to establish "retirement 
savings accounts," which are 
helpful but in essence are an 
accounting scheme that simply 
transfers income. 

The president then off-sets 
the remaining genuine tax cuts 
by new taxes such as a 25 cent-
per-pack boost in cigarette taxes 
and the elimination of several 
tax loopholes. The net effect of 
the proposal is a halving of the 
actual reduction. So the minus-
cule reduction gets halved into 
an insignificant tax cut not even 
worthy of this title. 

With so much spending on 
government programs, minus-
rule spending for the military and 
a virtually nonexistent tax cut, the 
president's proposal shows that 
he has returned to his true tax-
and-spend Democratic roots in 
this election year. While at one 
time in his administration Clinton 
declared that "the era of big gov-
ernment is over," the end anafysis 
shows that Senate Budget 
Chairman Pete v. Domenici was 
right when he declared that "the 
president is proposing the era of 
big government come back w ith a 
vengeance."

GOAL: 
Athletes deserve 
registration benefits 
ContInued from ..... 4 
immediately apparent. Athletics 
create a sense of community on 
campus: Students can attend 
games for entertainment, pro-
viding a medium for taking a 
break from academics. In addi-
tion to raising money for the 
school through game admission 
fees, sports also raise the UCSD 
profile. 

Since 1981 , intercollegiate 
athletics have brought home 25 
national championships, includ-
ing the 1999 NCAA Division III 
Women's Soccer Championship. 
Recognition such as this pro-
motes school prestige and 
demonstrates that UCSD stands 
for more than just academics. 
All students benefit from a well-
rounded univerSity that can 
boast of multiple areas of 
prowess. 

Intercollegiate sports facili-
tate these benefits for the uni-
versity while athletes make 
intercollegiate sports succeed. 
Thus, herping students to be 
both schola rs and athletes 

through priority registration is 
good for all students at UCSD. 

In addition to the advantages 
intercollegiate athletics provide, 
UCSD sports will be competing 
in Division n, a step up from its 
current Division III standing 
beginning fall 2()()(). In order for 
the athletes to commensurately 
raise their level of play to that of 
Division II competition, they 
will need to be able to make 
greater commitments to their 
sports. Priority registration will 
enable them to devote time as 
the sport demands, when it 
demands it. 

As Michael Jordan once 
said, "I'm not out there sweat-
ing for three hours every day 
just to find out what it feels like 
to sweal." 

Intercollegiate athletes at 
UCSD pursue a higher goal 
than simply working out; they 
create a sense of community. 

As UCSD advances to 
Division II, sports and athletes 
will need the full support from 
the school to prepare for 
increased competition. Priority 
registration for intercollegiate 
athletes is not only justified, but 
beneficial to every student at 
UCSD.

The UCSD Guardian 

FOUL: 
UCSD has tried to 
avoid athlete mentality 
ContInued from .... 4 
selected team of athletes. I oppose 
this system being emphasized over 
the recreational activity practiced 
by those who use facilities like 
RIMAe. 

The decision of supporting 
competitive sports appears a lot 
less understandable, and I have 
yet to hear any reasonable justifi-
cation for it . I have heardthat 
sports contribute to the creation 
of camaraderie and identification 
with the institution and its tradi-
tions. It is hard to understand, 
however, why the spirit of 
belonging to an academic institu-
tion should be fostered by com-
petitive activities. 

If living and studying togeth-
er is not sufficient to make people 
feel a part of the same institution, 
what can competitive sports add 
to this? The only thing I can think 
of is the element of contraposi-
tion. On a sports field, we only 
feel united in opposition to the 
other team. I am not sure that 
camaraderie based on these 
premises is SO desirable. 

There is a long tradition, espe-
cially in the United States, of 
including athletic ability among 
the academically desirable charac-
teristics. It is somewhat sad, to see 
that even places like \JCSD, which 
in the past attempted to distance 
itself from this tradition, feel the 
pressure to conform. 

In this sports-friendly mind-
set, the decision to grant priority 
registration to athletes is hardly 
surprising. Yet, for a number of 
reasons, it is quite disturbing. 

First, it establishes the princi-
ple that sports activities do inter-
fere with academic achievements 
and, when this happens, acade-
mics should accommodate 
sports, not vice versa. In this 
case, the degree of accommoda-
tion required is quite limited, but 
once that principle is established, 
it will tend to expand uncontrol-
lably. 

Second, we are acknowledg-
ing that athletic achievement is 
more important than academic 
achievement. Last year we had a 
brilliant undergraduate student 
in the lab - a Fulbright scholar. 
Like everyone who was taking a 
lot of classes, he had some trouble 
keeping- his commitments with 
the lab. Yet, he did not have any 
special registration privileges. 

Tuesday. February 22. 2000 

In spite of the reassurances we 
receive today, can the age of ath-
letic scholarships be too far away 
for UCSD? Only last year, several 
schools were involved in a scan-
dal for the use of female escorts 
during the visits of candidate stu-
dents with strong athletic creden-
tials. 

A few weeks ago several 
newspapers reported that college 
football players are growing tired 
of being the only people in the 
NCAA circuit without multi-mil-
lion dollar contracts. Professional 
sports are breeding grounds for 
pampered, irresponsible, ethical-
ly questionable and superficial 
stars. In spite of the hopes of the 
people who still think tney live in 
the age of Pierre de Coubertain, 
there are many signs that a simi-
lar attitude is beginning to 
encroach on the world of college 
sports. . 

UCSD will face several crucial 
decisions in its near future. We 
must decide whether we want to 
become a university in which aca-
demic excellence will continue to 
be the only measure of success. In 
a word, we have to decide 
whether a well-flexed biceps is 
more important than a well-flexed 
brain in our university.

COUNCIL: 
Communications post 
is cut under new plan 
CoM. aed ...... ,..1 
ing. "I do a lot of work but not 
as much as the other commis-
sioners." 

Once the new constitution 
goes into effect, the commis-
sioner of communications will 
become a director position, 
which will result in the 
appointee being paid less 
money and holding less 
power. 

In another change to the con-
stitution, the remaining four 
commissioners no longer have 
the power to vote on matters 
that are discussed in the A.S. 
Council meetings every 
Wednesday night. 

All the voting power will 
now shift to all the senators 
from each of the co1Jeges and 
classes. 

"11w senators have to go to 
A.S., College Council and 
Senate meetings to discuss the 
issues," Khunar said. "Due to 
the nature of the office, the com-
missioner is really not informed 
of the issue and' they don't real-
ly have time to make an educat-
ed vote." 

Lastly, any future changes to 
the constitution wiD require a 
three-fourths majority vote of 
the A.S. Council and a petition 
signed by at least 15 percent of 
the student body. 

"This makes it a lot easier for 
students to have a say," Khu11ar 
said. "This enforces a little more 
equality because anyone can 
amend the constitution. All they 
need is a I5-percent petition 
and three-fourths of the council 
to agree." 

Khullar described the new 

constitution as a combination of 
all the constitutions from all of 
the other University of 
California schools and the last 
five proposed constitutions. 

Khullar said current changes 
to the constitution were neces-
sary because they made the job 
of the president less difficult for 
the future. 

"This was definitely a gruel-
ing process that took a long 
time, but it needed to be scruti-
nized and that is what we did," 
he said. "This will make my job 
a lot easier in the future." 

However, these changes 
will not be implemented until 
at least next year, because 
three out of the five college 
councils have to approve the 
amendments and campaign-
ing before the next term 
begins. 

"These changes don' t affect 
the upcoming election because 
people have already ~n 
planning for this year," Khullar 
said. "It will probably be made 
official for the following elec-
tion." 

Khullar gives most of the 
credit for passing the constitu-
tion, a feat that has been 
attempted by the last five presi-
dents, to A.S. Vice President 
Internal Jennifer Lee, who spent 
many hours rewriting it with 
Khullar, and to the council as a 
whole. 

"Jen and I did a lot of work, 
but the council had to approve 
it," he said. "I am very 11appy 
that the council looked past 
their differences for the sake of 
the students. These changes will 
make things as efficient as p0s-
sible to provide the best service 
for students." 

After a week of debate, the 
AS. Council passed the consti-
tution in less than a half an 
hour.

"NAFTA exports jobs and

when he said that good fences 
make good neighbors.' We can-
not control the Mexican birth 
rate; they cannot control their 
own birth rate. We can only 
control the taxpayers and voters 
in America and in California." 

The next issue discussed in 
the debate was the city's role in 
education. While the city revels 
in the success of its "six to six" 
program, which gives youth a 
place to go both before and afte.r 
school, some of the candidates 
felt that as mayor they could 
further improve the program, 
as well as institute new ones. 

"How do we prepare our 
own citizens for a global econo-
my so that they can compete, as 
they are going to have to, with 
people from all over the 
world?" Roberts said. "One of 
the things that has me very con-
cemed is the presence, in San 
Diego, of a digital divide. Many 
of our youngsters are doing a 
super job at a very early age of 
mastering all the skills they 
need to utilize computers and 

technology, but there's another 
group that is being left behind. 

"There are households 
where you won' t find comput-
ers and you won' t find the same 
opportunities," Roberts contin-
ued. "We need to address that. I 
think San Diego could be the 
most technologically literate 
city in the world." 

The issue of maritime trade 
in San Diego was also put on 
the table, with the strongest 
response coming from Crane. 

"1 support maritime trade in 
San Diego because we have a 
wonderful port and we should 
take advantage of it, even 
though as Jacques Cousteau 
told us before he died, that it is 
the dirtiest body of water on the 
Western Coast," Crane said. 
"It's an insult to have people 
come here for the America's 
Cup and have to tack between 
the sewage just because our 
county has a permit to pollute. I 
think we deserve better. We 
deserve a clean ocean." 

Candidates also expressed 
concern that San Diego's accessi-
bility might interfere with its 
emerging importance in the g1ob-
al economy. San Diego does not 
currently service commerce com-
ing from South and Central 
America. 

"I think that San Diego really 
should be a global gateway for 
Latin-American commerce," 
Murphy said. "I don' t see why 
we don't have a port that 
accepts containers from Chile. 
The candidates also discussed 
the location of Lindbergh Field, 
developing property rights to 
the intellectual property of San 
Diego businesses, China's 
accession to the World Trade 
Organization, and they took 
audience questiOns at the end. 

The San Diego mayoral pri-
mary will take place on March 7.

Iranian Group Fears Backlash TAIWAN: Chinese government 
threatened to use force 

and the Taiwan Issue," was 
released by the Taiwan Affairs 
Office and the Information Office 
of the State Council, China's cabi-
net. TEHRAN, Iran - Evidently 

headed for a dramatic victory in 
parliamentary elections, Iran's 
triumphant reformers said on 
Monday their challenge now 
will be to manage the pace of 
change to avoid a dangerous 
backlash from the weakened but 
still-potent conservatives. 

The chief political adviser to 
President Mohammad 
Khatami, Hossein Valeh, said in 
an interview that if the reform-
ers' predictions are realized, the 
president will have a clear man-
date to act on his pledge to 
remake Iran from an insular 
country of disjointed ruling 
elites into a democratic state 
ruled by a dear set of constitu-
tiona I laws. 

Valeh, however, one of the 
president's closest confidants for 
more than 10 years, warned that 
the victory carries substantial 
risks. Khatami, he said, will have 
to temper the zeal of his new 
majority while rooting out the 
internal threats to democratic 
reform.

beaining face was emblazoned on 
the cover of Time and Newsweek; 
this week, it is Bush staring res-
olutelyfrom both covers. 

Now, on the eve of the primary 
here on Tuesday, McCain and his 
aides are still thunderstruck by 
their loss to Bush in South Carolina 
three days ago - the first defeat of 
the senator's political career. 

Inside McCain's famously 
chatty bus, the afterglow of New 
Hampshire is dimming by the 
day. Despite friendly crowds 
from Traverse City to Grand 
Rapids to here in Saginaw - and 
polls that show the Republican 

"When the opposition is very 
weak, the majority becomes a lit-
tle extravagant," he said. "Our 
direction will be the same, but it 
will be a question of the speed 
and scope of reforms." 

Valeh said that based on his 
analysis of the returns, pro-
Khatami reform candidates won 
73 percent of the parliamentary 
seats that were decided outright 
in the first round of elections 
held Friday and could weJl find 
themselves controlling 90 per-
cent after a second round of vot-
ing in Apri!. 

Official returns from the Feb. 
18 elections for the 290-seat 
Parliament have not yet been 
announced, and votes in sever-
al big cities, including Tehran, 
are still being counted by hand. 
A candidate needs at least 25 
percent of the vote to avoid a 
runoff. 

Since his landslide election 
in 1997, Khatami has largely 
avoided direct confrontation 
with the conservative 
Parliament and the rigid reli-

rivals neck and neck in Michigan 
- McCain and his aides were 
revisiting what might have been. 
They said that while they got too 
mired in tacti(s in New 
Hampshire and did not adequate-
ly respond to the governor 's 
onslaught of advertising and ora-
tory, they are still struggling to 
grasp what went awry. 

When asked about his predic-
tion before the South Carolina pri-
mary that a high turnout ,would 
assure McCain a win, John Weaver, 
McCain's political director - who 
just days ago was hailed in the 
press for his political deftness -
said, "Obviously, we didn't know 
what we were talking about." 

Noting that Bush's victory was 
not even close, as polls had pre-
dicted, Rick Davis, the campaign 
manager, said, "Everyone ought 
to be firing their pollsters." 

In public, McCain refuses to 
yield, acknowledging that "we 
took a shot to the stomach," but 
reminding audiences that he has 
"crashed a few airplanes" and 
knows how to recuperate. As he 
put it at a packed rally Monday 
morning in Traverse City, "I'm 
telling you, we're coming back! 
We' re coming back!"

clearly tapped into his youth-
ful country's restlessness for 
change. He now faces the prob-
lem of meeting the runaway 
expectations that the election 
of his supporters has 
unleashed. 

Valeh said the president is 
well aware of his mandate for 
change. 

"A great obstacle has been 
removed by this election and 
the president will be empow-

could in the last two and a half

if Taiwan refuses indefinitely to 
pursue "the peaceful settlement 
of cross-Straits reunification 
through negotiations, then the 
Chinese government will only be 
forced to adopt all drastic mea-
sures possible, including the use 
of force, to safeguard China's sov-

"This is a signal that Beijing is

in the process of reunification: 
said Andrew Yang, secretary-gen-

group in Taipei. This is a warning

March 18 presidential elections

It eJaborates on China's long-
standing proposal for a negotiated 
return of Taiwan under a version 
of the "one-country, two systems" 
formula, with even greater autono-

That formula has been rejected as 
too confining by Taiwan's leaders 
and by all three of the leading pres-

The dire warnings in the docu-

emotional issue the reunification 
of Taiwan with the Mmotherland" 
is for the Chinese - and how 
potentially explosive the con-

is, potentially drawing the United

Fox Divorces 'Who Wants 
to Marry a Multimillionaire' 

The Fox Network decided 
Monday to kill the potentially 

. lucrative franchise called "Who 
Wants to Marry a 
Multimillionaire," ending an 
episode almost as bizarre as the 
so-called reality-based programs 
for which the televi&ion network 
lias become known. 

The decision by Sandy 
Grushow, chairman of Fox 
Entertainment Television, came 
after Fox learned that. Rick 
Rockwell, the bridegroom in last 
week's widely watched special, 
had been the subject of a restrain-
ing order because of charges that 
he had physically threatened a 
girlfriend nine years ago. Fox 
executives said . Rockwell had 
failed to disclose the information 
during background checks lead-
ing up to the broadcast. 

On Sunday, the network can-
celed a repeat of last week's 
show scheduled for Tuesday 
night, but left open the possibili-
ty that it would broadcast new 

versions of the program in the 
future. Flush with the ratings 
success, Damell had announced 
last week his intention to mount 
a special with the genders 
reversed, and a female million-
aire selecting a husband. 

The delJl18e of the special rais-
es questions about the risks in a 
growing trend among the broad-
cast networks to rely on programs 
that put people into challenging 
and life-changing situations. 

In the coming months net-
works have plans to put people 
on a desert island swarming with 
cameras, to lock people together 
into a house filled with cameras, 
and even, in the case of one syn-
dicated show, to marry strangers 
off to each other every week. 

Mike Darnell, the executive 
vice president of Fox who 
invented the marry-a-millionaire 
concept, said the network had 
decided not to go forward with 
any other specials in that format 
because, "It's just not worth the 

risk." He said: "This is the end 
for this show. We are not doing 
another one." 

In the show broadcast a week 
ago, Rockwell, who billed him-
self as a real estate developer 
and motivational speaker, select-
ed among 50 prospective brides 
in a beauty pageant-like contest. 
He chose Darva Conger, an 
emergency room nurse. 

In the following days, howev-
er, information emerged that 
rose numerous questiOns about 
the truthfulness of some of 
Rockwell's claims. 

Rockwell, who retumed to his 
San Diego home from a honey-
moon trip to the Caribbean with 
Conger on Sunday, told a local 
television station, l<FMB, in San 
Diego: "As you know, this jour-
ney began with my desire to find 
love on a television show. I had 
no idea there would be so much 
interest and so much scrutiny."

I should have known better! 
I forgot my history and there-

fore I repeated it last weekend. 
Feb. 8, 1995, was supposed to 

be the best day of my life. That 
was the day I turned 16. I had 
been looking forward to driving 
for years, and finally the day was 
upon me. Unlike most people my 
age, I had taken the initiative and 
made a DMV appointment for 
my birthday. 

I had been practicing for 
weeks. I knew I would pass. 

I passed the parking section 
with flying colors, but came up 
one point short on the other parts 
of the test. I was devastated. It 
turned the supposed best day of 
my life into total misery. 

Fast forward five years. Feb. 8, 
2000. My 21st birthday. 

The day itself was great. I 
went and bought beer at mid-
night the night before. My 
friends and I went to TGI 
Friday's and I got free drinks by 
betting our waiter 1 could guzzle 
a beer faster than he had ever 
seen. We then went back to my 
apartment and drank late into 
the night. 

It was a good birthday if ever 
there was one.

THE EDITOR'S SOAPBOX 
Tales of birthday woes in Las Vegas, the City of Sin 

And then there was the week-
end. Las Vegas is only place to go 
for the weekend after your 21st 
birthday. 

I had been looking forward to 
this since the first time I went to 
Las Vegas when I was 10 and saw 
my first sl(>l machine. 

Even though I am not the gam-
bling mongrel that I once was, I 
still couldn't wait to see the lights 
of the strip. I had been counting 
the days for wet:ks, and then it 
finally came. It was going to be 
great. 

Or so I thought. 
I left straight from school and 

it took me three hours to get to 
0range County because of traf-

thing I could possibly imagine, 
and I knew it was only going to 
get better. 

After about 20 more minutes 
of driving we came over a little 
hill, and there it was - Las 
Vegas. It was the most beautiful 
thing I had ever seen. The lights 
of ilie strip only made us more 
anxious to arrive, anxious 
enough for me to not pay enough 
attention to my speedometer 
until the cops' lights lit up in 
back of me. 

This is where the weekend 
started to get ugly. After receiv-
ing my speeding ticket, my 
mOod was greatly dampened, 
but I was still in Vegas and) was 

a bum. The free alcohol wasn't 
even enough to liven up my spir-
its as night turned into day, 
which turned into night. 

The smoke in the casinos 
began to give me a chestache after 
two days in the dty, and my mus-
cles began to ache from the mal-
nourisfunent of the iodine-filled 
buffet food that the hotels pro-
vide. After 10 or 12 people had 
handed me flyers for whore h0us-
es, I began to feel truly nauseated. 
How can one dty embody all that 
is evil in this world? 1 didn't 
exactly consider mvaelf innocent 
before 1 went to ~egas. Now 1 
realize that 1 was. 

Yes, I lost money, but that was-

tic at the 5 and 805 merge. No 
problem. I expected traffic and 
nothing was going to ruin my 
mood. 

I picked up my buddy in 
Orange County and, after a quick 
stop for food, we were on our 
way. 

The drive from Orange 
County was long but we didn't 
care. We were on our way to 
Vegas, the Mecca of college stu-
dents and fun-loving adults 
alike. Little did we know what 
awaited us when we crossed into 
Nevada. 

We stopped at the stateline 
qUickly for a little gamblin8 and 
some pictures. It was the best 

stiD determined to have a good 
time. That determination qUickly 
dwindled as Vegas's allure began 
to ~de. 

Let me tell you aU something: 
Vegas is a sick place. , 

After a day or so, the bright 
lights of the strip begin to get a 
little dimmer. 

The extreme capitalism of 
Vegas got to be too much for me. 
This is me, Bill, the guy who 
eats, sleeps and breathes capital-
ism. 

~veryone on the strip is trying 
to find a way to get a dollar out 
of you. As long as you are gam-
bling you are a he!'O to them, but 
as soon as you stop, you be~me 

n't what bothered me. I couldn't 
believe that people actually lived 
in this place. To me this was proof 
of God's existence, because in this 
place of total sin, 1 had the worst 
time of my life. 

I also learned that there are 
people out there that are more 
addicted to gambling than 1 once 
was. 

You can tell who they are 
because they are gambling at the 
stupidest games in Vegas. 1 am 
talking about games like War. 
This game is simply you against 
the dealer, one card each. No 
skill or effort involved. 

Or if you like you can see the 
pathetic people gambling on

what my friend and I named 
"the stupid wheel." This is a 
wheel where you bet on which 
number will come up and are 
paid out on your odds accord-
ingly. It is a lot like roulette, but 
more mindless. You bet on things 
like "40" that give you 4O-to-l 
odds. These high numbers are 
what everyone betted on while 1 
was watching, but it landed on 
"1" each time. Spin after spin, 
the house sucked up the money 
that theIe poor saps had decided 
to lay down on t\\e hopes that a 
miracle would occur. 

Then there was the worst 
thing about Vegas - th~ drive 
home. 

Colllin3ln is fine because you 
are exdted to get there, but the 
trip back is pure hell. Six hours 
of pure hell. I was tired, 1 was 
sick. 1 was malnourished, yet 1 
had to make the six-hour drive 
back to San Diego County and to 
normalcy. It seemed like an eter-
nity, but 1 was finally here. 

Now 1 am much poorer than 
before, my driving record is no 
longer perfect and it is probably 
going to take me a few weeks to 
get over the sickness that I 
acquired on the Vegas strip. Did 1 
have a good time? You tell me. 
Vegas certainly wasn't what 1 
expected. 

What can you learn from me? I 
don't expect you not to go to 
Vegas. Its definitely not that I 
wouldn't want you to go. You 
have to experience it for yourself. 
Just do yourself a favor: Don't go 
right after your 21st birthday. You 
don't want to remember your 
birthday like 1 will forever 
remember mine.

New Industry Has College Women Trading Eggs for Dollars 
Attractive, intelligent women are being offered record amounts of money for their genetic traits 
By ALEXIS DENNY 
Staff Writer 

Increasingly, young, college 
educated women are being tar-
geted for egg donation. 

giOUS Ivy League universities. 
The extraction process is not 

simple. According to Egg 
Donation 1nc., the protocol begins 
at the start of the woman's men-
strual cycle. The donor undergoes 
an ultrasound to examine her 
ovaries and blood tests to check 
her hormone levels. She . is pro-
vided with disposable needles 
and several vials of a drug called 
Lupron, an ovulation suppressant 
that she must inject into herself

bids for eggs range from $15,(0) "This site simply mirrors our cur-

6.1 million American women and 
their partners. About 6,000 such 
eggs will be implanted in women 
across the United States this year, 
according to the American 
Society for Reproductive 
Medicine. In order to continue a 
supply, services are going to con-
tinue to place ads in college 
newspapers and other sources 
that appeal to young~ women. 

College can be a financial 
struggle, and donating eggs can 
seem like a quick and piolitable 
solution. Ads promise thousands 
of dollars, but students drawn to 
these ads may find that the 
process involves more than 
expected. Egg donation services 
and "egg shoppers" know that 
the university environment 
attracts well-educated women 
and tha t these same women may 
be vulnerable to what these ads 
promise. This promise of money 
offers college women the chance 
to pay for their college expenses. 
College women, however, may 
not fully understand the moral 
implications of donating eggs, 
and also the health risks that 
donating poses. Making an 
informed choice is the responsi-
bility of the potential donor, and 
if one chooses to donate, it needs 
to be for the right reasons. 

Unfortunately, many of these services and ads are not looking for your run-of 

Some people are concerned 
with the ethical implications of 
advertising for women to donate 
their eggs. 

"There is a fine line between 
ethical and tasteful advertisment 
for the needs of service and what 
I consider to be enticement," said 
physician Mark V. Saur. Nit

. the-mill, college-age women. IncreRSingly, there is an interest in prtrPiding the 
world with eggs only from beautiful women, and if they happen to be muJrt, 
that's a bonus. A woman who hll4 both brains and beauty may be able to receipe 
114 much 114 $100,000 for her ea!Js. 

A particular infertile couple is 
offering $100,000 for healthy eggs 
in a recently placed ad in tile 
Stanford Daily student newspaper. 
The couple wants the donor to be 
an athletic, young. white woman 
under the age of 30. The ad 
promises tha t in addition to the 
cash payment, all expenses will 
be covered. According to the 
Associated Press, the sum may be a 
record offered in a student publi-
cation. The p revious known high 
was $50,000, offered last year in 
ads placed at a number of presti-

every morning for three weeks. 
Eleven days later, the donor 
undergoes another ultrasound 
and blood tests. She continues 
taking Lupron and receives a sup-
ply of Pergonal, an ovulation 
stimulant that will cause her to 
produce a large quantity of eggs. 
She then undergoes another 
ultrasound to determine how her 
ovaries are responding to the 
medication. 

After undergoing a fifth ultra-
sound to checK on the develop-
ment of her eggs, the donor 
receives an injection of HCG, a 
pregnancy hormone that helps 
prepare her eggs for retrieval. On 
the day of the 
aspiration/ retrieval. her eggs are 
removed from her ovaries with a 
long needle. This is a nonshrgical 
procedure that takes about 20 to

egg broker. 

A Web site called Ron's

promises to be "the only Web site 
that provides you with the 
unique opportunity 10 bid on 
eggs from beautiful, healthy and 
intelligent women." 

Many of "Ron's Angels" hap-
pen to be young women, many of 
who are attending college. For a 
monthly membership fee, anyone 
who wants to ensure attractive 
offspring can shop through a 
gallery of attractive women who 
are selling their eggs.

Altfiough' Web Sites like thls 
one raise the issue of whether or 
not kids should be "engineered," 
some doctors do not worry that 
Darents are trying to engineer 
"su.r.;rkids." 

Most of our clients come in 
wanting someone who generally 
looks like they do - say short 
and dark," said AMette Lee, a 
reproductive endocrinologist in 
New Jersey. 

Although attractive and edu-
cated women are the hottest com-
modity, there is a market for aU 
women interested in dona tins. 
Egg donors remain in high 
demand. Infertility affects about 

There are important issues to 
address on bOth sides of the 
debate. 

NSorne doctors worry that egg 
brolcers are part of the overmar-
lceting of human eggs, a situation 
that could invite ethicallapees. 

"Others say ethical debates 
over egg donations while useful 
and nec:esary, have led to overre-
actions," states Pat Brennan of the 
Orange County Rqisttr.

legal, medical and psychological 
experts on egg donation,

see UCSD as a center of scientific

location within San . o. "Here 
in San Diego is a great p ce to be 
looking at these issues especially 
with t1le neurosciences at UCSD, 
Salk Institute and Scripps 
institute," Scull said. 

Roefs said that UCSD is in 
need of such a program because 
of the large chasm seen between 
the study of science and social sci-
ences in the curriculum. 

NAt UCSD, you have issues of 
money, et cetera, that come into 
play but also have this kind of a 
move to bridge the SIP and bring 
the discourses together," she said. 
"At any university with high 
regard for science, in my opinion, 
the relevance of the humanities to 
the sciences is often d ismissed; to 
bring this program to students is 
interesting. " 

Johns also expressed his 
enthusiasm for developing and 
teaching a minor such as this at 
UCSQ. 

"I find UCSD an exciting 
place to do this because the 
pedigree of science is so strong." 
he said. "Southern California 
and San Diego in particular 
show up in discussion because 
of the biotechnology and high-
tech research going on here. This 
is the world that we are talking 
about. Moreover, the student 
body is very interesting; they are 
a fertile mixture of scientists, 
computer people and human-
ists. We can get all these people 
in one room to discuss these 
issues."

ence and society minor or science

"She just took over the 
game," Malone sa'd. "She's 
done that a couple of times 
before. It's nice to know there's 
someone who can do that." 

The quality of Bromley's 
play has been first-class all year, 
but Malone wasn't fully aware 
of Bromley's abilities at the 
beginning of the year. 

uNicholle has been quite a 
wonderful surprise," Malone 
said. "I knew she was good, but 
she doesn't play like a fresh-
man. We were lucky to get her 
as a recruit. She's such a great 
kid. She wants the best for the 
team." 

Starting out the contest, the 
lhtons found themselves in a big 
hole - seven minutes into the 
game, UCSDwasdown 15-7. 

"I think we weren't hitting 
ow shots," Malone said of the 
Mustangs' early dominance. 

The' Tritons squelched the 
Mustangs' 11-0 scoring run 
when Bromley connected on a 
pair of baskets to cut the delidt 
to 15-12. The two squads battled 
back and forth for the rest of the 
half. 

Up 29-25 with a minute and a 
half to go in the first stanza, the 
Tritons scored four straight bas-
kets to close the half up 37-25. 

~ 39-28 early in the second 
half, the Mustangs galloped back 
with nine unanswered points to 
pull within two points at 39-37. 

"I trunk their coach read the 
riot act." Malone said. "We came 
out a little flat in the second half." 

Bromley added two more 
buckets to give the Tritons a 

more comfortable 44-37 advan-
tage, but The Master's College 
was not yel ready to quit. With 
UCSD up 49-43, the opponent 
rattled off seven unanswered 
points to take the lead at 50-49. 

The Master's College then 
extended its lead to 61-58 with 
just over two minutes of play, 
but again Bromley's play 
revived the home team. 

Bromley knocked down two 
tJuee..pointers to give her team a 
64-61 lead with a minute and a 
hall left. 

The Master's College could 
only muster a foul shot in the 
remaining time as UCSD scored 
seven more to finish the contest 
at 71-62. 

The Triton team had a number 
of star individual performances. 

Ashley Kokjohn scored 12 
and pulled down five rebounds 
and teammate Kimberley Neal 
scored 12 and grabbed four 
boards in the winning effort. 
Triton Mindy Misawa added 
seven points and dished out six 
assists. 

The Master's College had a 
big game from center Lesley 
Dubois; she had 23 points, 10 
rebounds and two blocks. 

It was also a special night for 
Triton seniors Amy Leu, Kate 
Thmbull and Marti Ernsberger 
as the game was their last regu-
lar season home game. 

The playoffs will hopefully be 
next up on the lhton sChedule. 

UI think we have a chance 
but I don't know right now," 
Malone said of the cfiance at a 
spot in the playoffs. "It would 
be hard to deny a 20-5 team. 
Eleven spots across the country 
go to independents and we're 
one of the top indq>endents in 
the country," 

UCSD will find out its play-
off fate on Sunday.

Track Looks Impressive 
During Meet in Pomona 
RECORDS: Many UCSD all-time marks are set as the Triton men and 
women are quickly getting into midseason fonn 
IJ ROIIIRT FULTON The Tritons had another 
AssocI8Ie Sports Editor woman catch a first-place finish 

The UCSD track and field ~m 
is back in action and looking 
strong for the upcoming season. 

At the Pomona-Pitzer All-
Comers competition, which fea-
tured teams from UCSD, 
Pomona-Pitzer, UC Irvine and 
Cal Poly, the Tritons showed that 
they mean business this season. 

the competition, which did 
not record any official times or 
scores, sported a number of 
impressive Triton finishes. 

ihe women had an especially 
dominating da . . 

"We're reaby strong," new 
UCSD Head Coach Tony Salerno 
said. "It looks like we'll have four 
of our runners in nationals. It's a 
balanced team. It is the best team 
that UCSD has ever had. H 

A number of UCSD's school 
records were shattered at the meet 
and there were also plenty of 
high-ranking UCSD perfor-
mances. 

Catherine Wong had a great 
afternoon as she hurled the 
javelin 120 feet, taking first at 
the competition. Her perfor-
mance was also good enough to 
earn second best in UCSD's his-
tory. 

Cindy Wong also did well for 
the Trttons as she took first in the 
100-meter hurdles with a time of 
1620, which is seventh all-time 
for UCSD. 

as Erin Selim took the 800-meter 
competition with a time of 2:17.86 
- the sixth best time in UCSD 
history. 

The Triton women also had a 
number of second-place finishers. 

On two occasIons freshman 
Laura Martti1a finished just short 
of first place as she took second in 
the tOO-meter with a time of 12.71 
and in the 200-meter with a time of 
26.32. These performances placed 
her seventh and sixth, respectively, 
on UCSD's all-time list. 

"We have a great sprinting 
team," Salerno said of the Triton 
women. 

Lilian Uu flew far in the triple 
jump as she leaped for a distance 
of 37 feet. That jump gave her sec-
ond place at the meet and seventh 
in the UCSD record books. 

The Tritons' Lynee Brinkman 
finished ri ht behind Nolan in 
the javelin :hrow as she tossed for 
119'7/1. The throw gave her sec-
ond at the meet and third all-
time. 

Jodi Waltz finished second in 
the pole vault contest but set a 
new UCSD school record by 
climbing for 10'6". , 

Sonia Teymourl also had a 
good day as her time of 2:19.77 in 
the 8O().melers placed her at sev-
enth in the Triton record book. 

Although the men did not 
have as many impressive finishes 
as the women, they did have a 

productive afternoon. 
"We're very good," Salerno 

said of the men's team. "It's one 
of the best ever." 

Jim Freeman was the star of 
the event as he placed first in the 
1l0-meter hurdles with a time of 
14.23. His time marked a UCSD 
school record. 

"It's not just a school record," 
Salerno said. "That time would be 
a qualifying time for Division 11. 
He's an unbelievable athlete and 
he'll get faster." 

The Triton rnen also did well 
in the 100-meter relay. Freeman, 
Wale Olangunju, Roger O'Keefe 
and David Newquist teamed up 
for second place with a time of 
42.96, giving them fifth aU-time in 
the UCSD record books. 

"I'm very pleased," Salerno 
said. "We have a good problem. I 
don't know who to put on the 
relay team. It's encouraging to 
have them run this fast for a group 
that hasn't run together before." 

The Tritons' next event is 
March 4 at the University of 
California championships in 
Irvine, where UCSD will be pitted 
against other University of 
California foes from Southern 
CalifOrnia. 

"Santa Barbara, Riverside and 
representatives from UCLA will 
be there," Salerno said. "We're 
looking forward to going against 
some Division I competition in a 
scored event. I think we'll do real-
Iywell."

Tony Gwynn is 
worth every penny 

I'm sorry but I just can't 
help it - when baseball is in 
season I have a hard time' 
thinking about anything else. 
The Triton baseball and soft-
ball teams are destroying 
every opponent who dares to 
enter their domain and spring 
training is well under way in 
Arizona and Florida. 

To further immerse myself 
in the baseball season, I was lis-
tening in to a local radio station 
earlier this week when I heard 
some news about Tony 
Gwynn. ow, I'm not a die-
hard 'Padres fan like many of 
you, but I respect Gwynn and 
all he means to San Diego, so I 
decided to listen in. It seems 
that Gwynn has requested to 
be made the highest paid 
Padres player ever, citing that 
he has done a great deal for the 
team over the years and now 
deserves to be compensated. 

This news came as a shock 
to me at first. Even in the years 
before Kevin Towers, Gwynn 
stuck by this team and took 
much less money than he 
deserved because he wanted 
to play in his hometown. A 
demand for more money was 
very out of character for the 
future Hall of Farner. 

The Padres have been cut-
ting payroll ever since their 
World Series season that 
ended in the fall of 1998. They 
plan on putting together a 
contending tearn once their 
new stadium gets built, but 
for now they just can't afford 
to be paying out big sums of 
money to nigh-priced free 
agents. Every baseball fan 
understands this aspect of the 
game, but Gwynn isn't just 
any free agent. 

Despite the fact that he is 
getting old, Gwynn is proba-
bly still the most productive 
member of the Padres team. 
For that reason alone he 
deserves to be paid more than 
the other Padres players. 

Gwynn has been a stalwart 
in this community since he 
was a rookie in 1983 and even 
before that when he played 
baseball at San Diego State. 
He has shown loyalty to his 
team and his city in a way that 
few players have. He will cer-
tainly go down as the best 
player in Padres history, and 
he is also one of the best peo-
ple who has ever worn a 
Padres uniform. For all these 
reasons he deserves to be 
compensated. 

Gwynn isn't going to be 
playing baseball for that 
much longer. It would be a 
shame to have him go to an 
American League team and 
be a designated hitter for the 
rest of his career. If the Padres 
give him a short-term con-
tract, his salary will not hurt 
them when they are in the 
position to make another run 
at the series. This is their only 
option as far as most fans see 
it t>ecause for all that Gwynn 
has meant to the organization 
and to baseball as a whole, a 
little backpay is not much to 
ask.

Defense Ensures 
Softball Victories 
DOMINANT: The Tritons keep their opponents from scoring 
in double-headers against Redlands and Whittier 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Associate Sports Editor 

If the performance of the UCSD softball 
tearn over the first four games of its young 
2000 season is any indication of how the 
spring season will unfold, opposing teams 
have a great deal to worry about. 

The Tritons have been on a tear coming 
out of the gate, winning all four of the games 
they have played so far. 

Not onfy have the Tritons averaged seven 
and a half runs a game, they have outscored 
their opponents 30-0 over the four-game 
span. That's right. Not a single batter has yet 
to cross home plate against Triton pitching 
this year. 

"We have, I think, the best team I've ever 
had at UCSD," Triton Head Coach Patti 
Gerc.kens said. "We have some incredibly 
solid hitters. They hit the way they should 
hit. They know how important each game is 
in order to get to the postseason." 

UCSD's most recent pair of wins came 
Friday in a double-header against Whittier 
College Poets. 

The first game was a laugher as clutch 
hits, Poet errors and a fine performance from 
winning Triton hurler Erin Hannigan com-
bined for a 12-0 win. 

Flannigan was superb, pitching a perfect 
four innings. The game was shortened to 
five innings due to the eight-run mercy 
rule. 

"Erin has done a tremendous job," 
Gerckens said. "She pitched a perfect game. 
It was a team effort. Everyone did their job." 

Stacy Bolaris came on m the fifth inning to 
strike out two and close out the contest. 

Christina Searing also had a big game for 
UCSD, garnering a triple and a home run in 
her two at-bats. 

The slaughter came quickly as Searing 
tripled to lead off the bottom of the first. She 
was driven in by Michelle Wilson and the 
score was 1-0. Wilson and teammate Kristina 
Anderson both came around to score after a 
Poet error on an Erin Bridges bunt and the 
game was 3-0. 

In the bottom of the second, UCSD's 
Kristin Hunstad reached first on a Whittier 
error. Searing came to bat and rocketed a 
home run over the left field fence to extend 
the Triton lead to 5-0. 

It was more of the same in the third inning 
forUCSD. 

Anderson, Bridges and Jeanine Cordero 
all scored to extend the Triton lead to 8-0. 

The embarrassment did not stop in the 
fourth as UCSD tacked on four more runs to 
seal the victory. 

The Second game of the double-header 
against Whittier was almost as bad, as UCSD 
won 8-0. 

Samantha Hayes and Kim Vorsatz each 
pitched an inning with Vorsatz striking out 
two. 

The Poets' Stacee Karnya allowed seven 
hits and six eamed runs in the loss. 

The win was a complete team effort as the 
seven Trtion hits came from seven different 
players. UCSD's Marcella Di Micheli and 
Caroline Engler each had two RBis to lead 
the Tritons. 

Last week, the Tritons traveled to square 
off against the University of Redlands to

Baseball's 
Streak 
Reaches Six 
ROWNG: Solid pitching 
and clutch hitting boost 
Tritons to victories 
By BILL BURGER 
Sports Editor 

You could say the baseball team has 
been in a zone of late. 

The pitching and defense have been 
stepping up when they have had to 
and the offense is certainly getting the 
job done. Together, this combination of 
pitching, defense and offense tells why 
the Tritons are on an impressive six-
game winning streak. 

On Thursday, the Tritons had a dra-
matic come-from-behind victory over 
Cal State Dominguez Hills. UCSD then 
went on to defeat Menlo College three 
times last weekend. 

Against Cal State Dominguez Hills, 
the Tritons found themselves down 
from the outset as they were down ~ 
after three innings. 

The Tritons got one run back if) the 
sixth inning when Matt Merrifield was 
hit by a pitch and eventually scored on 
Chad Addison's RBI Single. UCSD was 
unable to score any more in the inning 
and began to get desperate as it looked 
for a chance to take the lead. 

TIle Tritons got their chance as a sin-
gle and two hit-batsmen loaded the 
bases for clean-up hitter Chris Tallman

Win Should 
Put Women 
in Playoffs 
BASKETBALL: 20-5 
record should be enough 
to ensure postseason 
By ROBERT FULTON 
Associate Sports Editor 

The UCSD women's basketball 
team ended its regular season at home 
Saturday night in the same fashion it 
has been ending its games for the entire 
year - with a big win. 

'The Tritons downed The Master 's 
College Mustangs 71-62 to finish the 
year 20-5 with a chance for a spot in 
the playoffs. 

UCSD had a big 37-25 lead going 
into halftime and managed to maintain 
the upper hand from there. The win, 
however, was not as easily gained as 

th~ final score indicates. 
. "They came in fired up," Triton 

Head Coach Judy Malone said of the 
opposition. "They had lost four of their 
last five, so I didn't think they would 
be that fired up, but The Master's 
[College) is always a good team." 

The victory was precarious at times, 
but UCSD had nothing to fear with 
Nicholle Bromley on Its side. 

The freshman guard from San Diego 
finished the contest with 21 points, 
four rebounds and six steals, and had a 
number of timely baskets that killed 
Mustang runs.
