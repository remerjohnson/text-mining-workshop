(SACRAMENTO) Legislation was 
introduced last week in the state 
Legislature that would protect the 
Unemployment Insurance (UI) 
benefits of some students who are 
currently in danger of losing them. 

The bill (AB 355). introduced by 

Recent ,Suicide Should "Enrich Medical 
Students' · Outlook on Life" --Dean Moxley 
The apparent suicide of uam 

second-year medical student 
Richard Buckner "should 
somehow enrich the medical 
students' attitude toward life and 
living," according to School of 
Medicine Dean John Moxley. 

Moxley, in an interview last 
week, said he feels that 
Buckner's death will help 
students "begin looking toward 
the living." 

Buckner was found dead of 
carbon monoxide poisoning in his 
car at 10:30 am on Jan. '1:1, after 
his girlfriend had reported him 
missing that morning, because he 
had failed to return to their 
Genessee Ave. apartment from 
an evening class on Jan. 26. A 
jogger informed authorities of 
Buckner's location after 
becoming alarmed at seeing him 
in his car. The San Diego 
coroner's office called Buckner's 
death a suicide. 

situation, Moxley commented 
that "this is a very demanding 
business we're in." 

Town Meeting 
Dr. Harold Simon of the 

community medicine department 
at the medical school said the 
news became official on Jan. 28 
and was then communicated to 
the students. A "town meeting," 
where "anyone who feels moved 
to say something does so," 
lollowed the announcement with 
students, faculty, staff and the 
Reverend Leslie Atkinson in 
attendance. Discussion centered 
mainly on what people 
remembered of Buckner, said 
Simon, who viewed the event as a 
"drawing closer together." 

Department heads were 
alerted to the noon memorial 
service, held last Tuesday so that 
students would be free to attend 
without conflict in their class 
schedules. 

When asked to describe the 

analytically and emotionally. 
Initially, one thinks of ways in 

which the tragedy might have 
been prevented. A period of 
denial follows, when the person is 
convinced that the victim could 
not have taken his own life and 
that foul play must have been 
involved. Eventually, there is an 
"acceptance of the fact." 

Question$ Raised 
According to Moxley, "Nothing 

has surfaced within the student 
body and medical school as to 
why Buckner took his life the way 
he did." The police feel that the 
facts of Buckner'S death point to 
suicide, but the victim's family 
has raised questions as to 
whether or not f«JI play s 
involved. Some of Buckner's 
friends have reportedly said he 
was not despondent, and had in 
fact, made plans for the evening. 

Moxley stresses it is "not true 
we are unfeeling. We hope when 
people have problems they find 
students, faculty, administrators 
or whoever to share them with." 

Bill McVittie (D-Upland), would 
prohibit students, who are 
available only for part-time work 
during nO!l-school hours, from 
eligibility for UI benefits unless 
they: 

-have a history of being sclf-
supporting from part-time work ; 

-have a claim based on part-
timework, 

- are willing to accept work 
during the same hours the wages 
were accrued, 

-have no other restrictions on 
work availability and are in a labor 
market where work is available. 

SimUarBill 
A similar bill, AB 28, was in-

troduced by Dixon Arnett (R-
Redwood City) in December. But 
Arnett's bill would have no ex-
ceptions and would simply deny UI 
benefits to any student who 
"places unreasonable restrictions 
on his or her availability" for work 
(such as restricting availability to 
non-school hours ). 

According to current law, a 
person is eligible for UI benefits if 
able to work and available for 
work. It also provides that a person 
shall not be ineligible solely 
because he or she is a student. 

The two bills are in response to 
the case of Enid Ballantyne, a 
UCLA law student who applied for 
UI b nems arly last y ar. 
Ballantyne told the Employment 
Development Department (EDD), 
which administers the UI claims, 
that she would accept part-time 
work only if it did not interfere with 
her classes. She said she would 
accept a full-time job only if it paid 
at leas~$l,OOO a month. 

EDD refused Ballantyne's 
claim, and she appealed the 

Moxley, who was out of town 
when Buckner's suicide was 
discovered, said he was "grieved 
and concerned" upon hearing the 
news. After reflecting on the 

. students' response to Buckner's 
suicide, Moxley noted that when 
death occurs in the medical 
school, it is taken "seriously, -Laura Richter decision to the California Unem-

ployment Insurance Appeals 

Board. On May 11. the board, by a 
three-to-two vote, held that 
Ballantyne was eligible for UI 
benefits. 

EDD took legal action in 
Sacramento Superior Court on 
June 17 to overturn the board 
decision. The Court granted an 
immediate stay on the precedent 
nature of the Board's decision so 
that the precedent would have no 
effect in granting or denying UI 
benefits to other claimants. 
Ballantyne continued to receive 
her payments. 

Director's Arguments 
Martin Glick, director of EDD, 

said the Ballantyne decision should 
be overturned because employers 
(who pay the UI premiums), might 
not hire students for summer work 
if they thought the students could 
file for UI benefits upon returning 
to school. 

The stay on the Ballantyne 
decision was dissolved on Sept. 28 
by a decision of the Sacramento 
Superior Court. Judge Lawrence 
Karlton said he agreed with EDD's 
narrow interpretation of the limits 
of eligibility, but said the 
Ballantyne case was within those 
limits. 

"This is a case involving an 
applicant who has for a period of 
ten years been both a student and 
an employee, has earned all the 
unemployment benefit credits 
claimed here as a part-time em-
ployee, and whose employment 
was terminated wholly without 
relationship to her school status," 
Lawrence sain. 

EDD is now appealing the Sept. 
28 decision to the Third District 
Court of Appeals. According to an 
official in the EDD legal section, 
the case will not be ready for 
hearing until some tin)e in March. 

Scientists Debate DNA, Genetic Engineering Guidelines 
by Joel C. Don 

Associate News Editor 

The debate probably first began in 1974, where an o~ 
server at the now-famous conference in Asilomar, 
California, called it the "Pandora's Box Congress." 

Over 100 distinguished scientists from all over the world 
gathered to discuss the potential benefits as well as the 
hazards and the regulation of a new scientific frontier -
recombinant DNA research. 

The eventual outcome of Asilomar was an extensive set of 
guidelines adopted by the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH). But neither the guidelines nor the research has met 
Wlanimous acceptance. 

In the summer of 1976, an intense confrontation between 
Scientists from Harvard University and MIT led to a 
temporary moratorium at the request of the Cambridge 
City Council. 

And, last Saturday at UCSD, where recombinant DNA 
research is proposed, two scientists debated the current 
issues of this controversial research. 

Titled "The Recombinant DNA Controversy: A Public 
Forum," the debate featured Donald Helinski, biology 
professor at UCSD and Project Director for DNA research 
here and Robert Sinsheimer, chairman of the biology 
diviSion at California Institute of Technology and a leading 
critic of the research. 

The debate was jointly sponsored by Alumni and Friends 
UC San Diego University Extension and Third College. 

"Cut _ Pute" 
Speaking to a near-capacity audience in the Mandeville 

Auditorium, Helinski ouWned the specific technology in-
volved in recombinant DNA research. 

The research involves the transplantation of genes from 
one organism into another by a "cut and paste" method 
USing specific enzymes to break the DNA chains. Scientists 
can take specific genes from any organism and plant them 
in E. coli bicterta, a suitable", becaUle It hu been ell-
tensively studied and can be cultured In large numbers, . 
Helinald aaid. 

AlthoUlo'a HeUnlkl acmttted that 101M 01 the beneftta wiD 
not be immediately ... lIIed, he outUned a few 01 the 

possibilities for the research, including: performance of 
fine structural analysis to better understand disease 
processes' and the structure and· function of genes; 
production of large amounts of human insulins and hor-
mones; production of essential vaccines; increasing the 
nitrogen fixing ability of agricultural crops; and production 
of amino acids, through E. coli "factories ." 

In addition to the benefits, Helinski also recognizes the 
argument of the potential hazards. 

" It has been conjectured that the barrier between 
eucaryotic DNA, or human DNA, and bacterial DNA is a 
good and natural barrier," and Helinski noted that scien-
tists fear crossing these so-called species barriers. 

"It is in response to these potential hazards that a com-
mittee of the NIH drafted guidelines for conduct of this 
research" he said. Helinski asserted that potentially 
hazardous research, such as experiments utilizing toxins or 
known pathogens, are banned by the NIH Guidelines. 

UCSD blologv profeuor Donald Helinski addresse a large 
audience 01 Saturday's forum on recombinant DNA re earch . 

Sinsheimer agreed that the proposed benefits are " real 
and tenable," but expressed his concern for the safety of the 
research. He criticized the effectiveness of the current 
regulations in the NIH Guidelines. 

"I believe the policies to govern the recombinant DNA 
technology and genetic engineering need extensive thought 
and discussion," Sinsheimer said, and added the NIH 
Guidelines "have been too narrowly conceived and are 
inadequate to the issue." 

"We have the power to introduce quantum jumps into 
the evolutionary process," Sinsheimer said, "but do we 
have the commensurate understanding to forsee the con-
sequences to the currently established equilibria on which 
our life support· systems depend? 

"My principle objection to the NIH Guidelines is that they 
do not reflect the evolutionary implications of what we are 
now about. They ignore the potential evolutionary con-
sequences for ourselves and our fellow creatures," he said. 

Helinski disagreed with Sinsheimer's evolutionary 
argument. Helinski suggested that the so-called species 
barrier has been broken because E. coli in our intestinal 
tract plus the plant and animal cells we consume ha e been 
involved in genetic exchange. . 

"It's a highly probably pl"ediction that these kinds of 
recombinations have occurred in nature given the long 
period of time that man ha lived on the Earth," Helinski 
said. 

The NIH Guidelines stress two forms of containment -
biological and physical. Biolt gical containment concerns 
the use of special E. coli whid have " elf-destruct" gene, 
prohibiting the organism from urviving in an environment 
outside of laboratory confinem nt. 

Physical containment is ouUined by raded risk fa ilities, 
from PI, or low risk, to P4, or rugh flSk. U . 'u has plans to 
construct a P3, or mo~rate risk lab in the top floor of the 
new Medical Tea bing Facility (currently under con-
struction) . 

Sinsh imer argued against the unlimited construction of 
facilities for the perfonnance of recombinant DNA 
research.

said. ~ 

But HelinUi S!ggested that if the work is limited to one or two labs it 
will "eventaulll hut down the research." 

Sinsheimer. h ~ ever, did nOt agree with the idea of the research being 
discontinued due w a limited number of facilities. 

"We all know astronomers have gone to their telescopes and physicists 
go to their high energy accelerators and the research has hardly stop-
ped," Sinshelmer said. 

Helinski said that he cannot assure that the risks of the research will be 
"zero," but added that he could not assure that "an earthquake won't 
happen right now in this auditorium. 

" I do not feel that the NllI Guidelines are 'grossly inadequate,' " 
Helinski said. "They are not cast in marble and it is our hope that there 
will be public input." 

Sinsheimer said "the guidelines acknowledge that we shouldn't in-
tentionally insert substances known to prOduce toxins into E. coll," but 
asserted that "the problem is, do we really MOW wbat a toxin is or wbat 
would give rise to a toxin?" 

"The recombinant DNA technology was developed by scientists to 
solve their own scientific problems," Sinsheimer said. "With respect to 
this question of freedom of inquiry, no scientist would claim the right to 
do an experiment which was of great potential hazard, but who makes 
that decision as to which experiments are hazardous? 

"I know scientists who would claim they have the right to make that 
decision," Sinsheimer said.

Even a cursory review of the

A small minority of grJlduates

If we consider the impending

Qpen Letter 
Muir 'Council Defends 
Elections BOard Rules 
The Muir CoUege Council voted 

5-1-1 to uphold the UC San Diego 
Elections Board Guidelines. The 
majority opinion ran the spec-
trum from "It was just not fair to 
change the rules of the game 
after everyone has finished 
playing" to "it is considered 
highly necessary that in-
formation about all the issues and 
models be provided so that the 
voters would have a clear un-
derstanding of the Issues." It 
was felt that if the authors of the 
models and issues could not 
comply with the simple and 
ultimately agreed upon 
guidelines then those models and 
issues should not be on the ballot. 

The authors of two models and 
(our issues showed the ability to 
meet the requests of the Elec-
tions Board: All the proponents 
had more than equal time to 
submit their proposals to the 
Board. Guidelines should not be 
altered just to meet the desires of 
a few individuals who did not take 
the time, energy, or effort to 
meet the agreed upon criteria. 
To do so would succeed in making 
a faI:ce out of the referendum. 

What was that criteria? Two , 
hundred and fifty signatures 
required to show a minimum of 
support and to test the viability of 
the issues or model and a short 

statement and . supporting 
materials to ensure that items 
presented were: 

1. carefully researched, and 
not joke questions ; 

2. contained factual data; 
3. clarified the Issue; and 
4. provided general voter in-

formation. 
Only the authors know what 

their propositions mean. It is not 
the role of either the Elections 
Board or the voter to read the 
minds or to second guess the 
authors. It is the responsibility of 
the author alone to provide this 
information. 

Therefore we urge the Colleges 
and their Election Board 
representatives to retain the 
guidelines they ratified and to 
execute the business of this 
referendum. We resent the at-
tempts of individuals and groups 
to log jam the referendum 
process. These people knew the 
guidelines and agreed to them. 
Let us bicker and dally no longer. 
It is time to hear from..1he

Champs Face 
Tritons Here 
Tomorrow 

by David Elsen 

UCSD's varsity basketball team 
opens the second round of league 
play here tomorrow night still 
looking for its first victory, after 
losing to the only team it was ex-
pecteil to beat,last Thursday. 

Cal Baptist , last year's NAIA 
district champions, currently 
reside in second place, one game 
behind Point Loma and will be here 

at 8 pm. The Lancers beat UCSD 
easily three weeks ago. 

In Thursday's fight for last place 
in league play, the Tritons found 
that a two-man show was in-
sufficient against USlU (8-14,1-4 in 
league). Center Mark Runyan hit 
nine of 12 shots for 20 points and 
seven rebounds, while forward Lee 
Gardner sank seven of 11 with 
eight rebounds, as USIU won 75-56. 

Without the two stars, the 
Tritons could make just 11 of 44 
shots, 25 per cent. USIU, mean-
while, was hitting over 50 per cent 
and the Tritons could not keep 
pace, especially after Gardner 
fouled out in the second half. 

Coach Dick Satterlee alternated 
a zone and man-to-man defense, 
neither of which could stop the hot-
shooting Westerners. Down by 11 
at the half , 33-22, came as close as 
five in the second half on a dunk by 
Lee Brockett. 

UCSD (3-19, 0-5 in league) had 
beaten USIU a month ago in the 
UCSD Invitational , 72-71. 
Westerner coach Mike McDonald 
had his team ready this time 
however, with a barrage of outside 
bombs and inside layups. 

The Tritons had just come back 
from a road trip to the north, losing 
to Cal State Hayward 110-88 and St. 
Mary's 102-75 . 

Saturday, UCSD was stopped 
107-79 by Chapman College despite 
30 points by Ken Melvin. Much of 
Melvin's efforts were offset by the 
play of a tall Chapman team, 
which included a 7' center. 

Coach Satterlee continues to be 
stymied by the poor record of a 
team that is used to winning half its · 
games. Five games remain for him 
to find some kind of answer.'

----~ .... ..;........ . . 

-in col.lege ••• 
don't you? 
Not if you 're haVing trouble With some regu-
larly assigned texts. But don 't despair. Help 
is as close as your college bookstore in the 
form of WiI.ey Sell-Teaching Guides. These 
are real keys to knowledge presented in a 
self-instructional format. They can teach 
you anything from genetics to how to use 
your library more effectively to increasing 
your knowledge o f chemistry to sharpening 
your study skills. 
And the best part is that you can do it by 
yourself and when you want to. There are 
no deadl ines to meet. no external pressures 
to complicate learning. What's more. each 
Self·Teach ing Guide has been wri tten . test-
ed. and rewri tten unti l it 's fai lure proof. That 
makes for some pretty effect ive learning! 
Here are just a few STG·s. Each teaches 
skills that help to make life a little easier at 
school: 
• STUDY SKILLS / Carman & Adams ($3.95) 

teaches basic strategies for improving 
reading. writing. listening . researching. 
and classroom learning. 

• QUICK CALCULUS / Kleppner ($4 .95) 
helps you learn the elementary tech-

niques of different ial and in tegral calcu-
jus quickly and efficiently. Includes solu· 
tions to all problems. 

e QUICKHAND"'/ Grossman ($3 .95) teaches 
you time·saving. high speed shorthand 
using just the letters of the alphabet. 
Think how much laster you could take 
lecture notes! 

• STATISTICS / Koosis ($4 .95) explains the 
basic methods and concepts of statistics 
as it is used today In business and 
industry. Teaches how to perform useful 
statistical tests and how to interpret the 
resul ts. 

There are now 56 STG's available on a wide 
range of subjects. You can see the entire 
line at your college bookstore. And then 
you can rest easier. because you won 't 
have to devote exorbitant amounts of time 
to study.

piano performance. 
The scholarship concert series 

was initiated last year by the 
. UCSD Music.faculty to assist gifted 

young musicians with their 
musical education. Last year's 
scholarship donors enjoyed a 
Sonata recital with violinist Rafael 
Druian, of the Music Faculty, and 
llse von Alpenheim, a pianist of 
international repute, for the first 
benefit concert. And an aU Bach 
organ concert with the inimitable 
Anthony Newman, for the second. 

The Music Department urges all 
who enjoy music and want to help 
the career of gifted young
